<P>THE events related in the following pages, naturally became a frequent &s;ubject of conver&s;ation with my children and my friends. They felt &s;o much &s;atisfaction at the accounts which I gave them, that they repeatedly urged me to commit the whole to paper; and their affectionate partiality induced them to &s;uppo&s;e, that the narrative would be, not only agree|able to them, but intere&s;ting to the public. In complying with their &s;olicitations, I am far from being confident that the &s;ucce&s;s of my efforts will ju&s;tify their hopes: I tru&s;t, however, that too much will not be expected, in regard to literary compo&s;ition, from a per&s;on who&s;e life has been principally devoted to the duties of a &s;oldier and the &s;ervice of his country&mdash;and that a &s;crupulous adherence to truth will compen&s;ate for many blemi&s;hes in &s;tyle and arrangement.</P>

I confe&s;s to you, my dear boy, that often when I have endeavoured to amu&s;e you with the leading in|cidents and extraordinary vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune which chequered the whole of that &s;eries of adventures, and ob&s;erved the eager attention with which, young though you were, you li&s;tened to the recital, the tender &s;en|&s;ibility you di&s;clo&s;ed at &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, and the earne&s;t de&s;ire you expre&s;&s;ed that "I &s;hould the whole relate," I have felt an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e to indulge you with an accurate and faithful narrative, and have more than once &s;at down at my bureau for the purpo&s;e: but &s;ober and deliberate reflection &s;ugge&s;ted that it was too &s;oon, and that, by complying with your de&s;ire at &s;uch a very early period of your life, I &s;hould but ren|der
<PB N="18" REF="031911_0014_0FEF48E206A6DD98">
the great end I propo&s;ed by it abortive, fru&s;trate the in&s;truction which I meant to convey, and impre&s;s the mere incident on your memory, while the moral deducible from it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily evaporate, and leave no trace, or rather excite no idea, in a mind not &s;uf|ficiently matured for the conception of ab&s;tract prin|ciples, or prepared by practice for the deduction of moral inferences.</P>
<P>I am aware that there are many people, who, con|templating only the number of your days, would con|&s;ider my undertaking this arduous ta&s;k, and offering it to your reflection, even now, premature: but this is a &s;ubject on which I have &s;o long and &s;o deliberately dwelt, which I have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with &s;o much care, and examined with &s;uch impartiality, that I think I may be acquitted of vanity, though I &s;ay I am competent to form a judgment on it. The re&s;ult of that judge|ment is, that I am determined to indulge you without further delay; and I tru&s;t that you will not, on your part, render it an empty indulgence, but, on the con|trary, by turning every circum&s;tance to its be&s;t u&s;e, by converting every feeling which the&s;e pages may excite in your heart into matter of &s;erious reflection, and by making every event (as it happens to de&s;erve) an ex|ample to promote either emulation on the one hand, or circum&s;pection and caution on the other, ju&s;tify me in that opinion of you on which I found this determi|nation.</P>
<P>I remember, that when, at an early age, I entered upon that &s;tage of cla&s;&s;ical education at which you are now, at an earlier age, arrived&mdash;I mean, the Aeneid &mdash;I was not only captivated with the beautiful &s;tory of the Hero, in the &s;econd Book, but drew certain in|ferences from parts of it, which I &s;hall never forget, and which afterwards &s;erved to give a direction to the growth of my &s;entiments on occa&s;ions of a &s;imilar na|ture: above all, the filial piety of Aeneas made a deep

impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, and, by imperceptibly ex|citing an emulation in my bo&s;om, augmented con&s;ider|ably the natural warmth of my affection and re&s;pect for my father. It is under the recollection of this &s;en&s;ation, and a firm per&s;ua&s;ion that your heart is fully as &s;u&s;ceptible of every tender impre&s;&s;ion, and your un|der&s;tanding as fit for the reception of u&s;eful hi&s;tory, as mine was then, that I overlook your extreme youth, and write to you as though you were an adult. If there be a thing on earth of which I can boa&s;t a per|fect knowledge, it is my FREDERICK's heart: it has been the object of my uninterrupted &s;tudy almo&s;t &s;ince it was fir&s;t capable of manife&s;ting a &s;en&s;ation; and, if I am not very much mi&s;taken in it indeed, the lively intere&s;t he feels in the occurrences of his father's life, is the re&s;ult, not of idle curio&s;ity, but unbounded filial affection. Such an amiable motive &s;hall not be di&s;ap|pointed in its end; and while I di&s;charge the duty of a parent in gratifying it, I &s;hall be encouraged and &s;u&s;tained under my labours by the &s;anguine expecta|tion, that he will derive from my exertions the mo&s;t &s;olid advantages in his future progre&s;s through life. As tho&s;e advantages are expected al&s;o to extend to my dear boy JOHN, who&s;e tender years di&s;qualify him from making the &s;ame immediate reflections on the various &s;ubjects as they occur, my FREDERICK will perceive that it becomes his duty, not only as a good &s;on, but as an affectionate brother, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and en|force them upon his mind, to explain to him the dif|ficulties, and furni&s;h him with his rea&s;onings and in|ferences on them, &s;o as that they may make, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, equal impre&s;&s;ions on the heart and under|&s;tanding of both.

make deep impre&s;&s;ions on their feelings, I am convinced that my &s;ufferings and errors, as they will intere&s;t my FREDERICK's heart, and gratify his curio|&s;ity, cannot fail to enlarge his under&s;tanding, and im|prove his conduct.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in compliance with your reitera|ted &s;olicitations, determined to give you a narrative of my journey to the Ea&s;t Indies, and the &s;ingular turns of fortune which befel me there, I think it nece&s;&s;ary, on reflection, to prepare you &s;till further for the recep|tion of it, by propo&s;ing certain terms to be fulfilled on your part; and as, in my la&s;t, I told you that I ex|pected you, and, with your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, your brother, to turn my relation to a more u&s;eful account than the gratification of mere idle curio&s;ity, by letting the mo|ral deducible from my errors and misfortunes &s;trike deep and take root in your mind&mdash;&s;o there are other things, which, though not &s;o extremely important, are too weighty to be neglected; to which I de&s;ire to direct your attention.</P>
<P>I believe you mu&s;t have already perceived, that the well-being of your&s;elf and your brother is my fir&s;t&mdash;I might, perhaps, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing much upon truth, &s;ay, my only object in life; that, to the care of your education, and the cultivation of your mind, I exclu|&s;ively
<PB N="21" REF="031911_0017_0FEF48E8B192CFA8">
devote my time and my thoughts; and that, to in&s;ure your future happine&s;s, I would &s;acrifice every thing I have a right to di&s;po&s;e of, and ri&s;k even life it&s;elf. The time, I tru&s;t, is not far di&s;tant, when your brother will be as well qualified to under&s;tand this as you are now&mdash;when both will feel alike the important duty it enforces on you&mdash;and when your only emula|tion will be, who &s;hall produce the mo&s;t luxuriant har|ve&s;t to reward the labours I have taken&mdash;to reward your&s;elves.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, on my part, to give every thing I do a tendency to the great object of my wi&s;hes, and induce you, on your's, to contribute your &s;hare to it, I &s;hall give you, as I proceed in my narrative, a topo|graphical de&s;cription of the various Countries through which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to conduct you, and, as conci&s;ely as may be, an account of their manners, po|licy, and municipal in&s;titutions, &s;o far as I have been able to collect them; which I hope will &s;erve to awaken in you a thir&s;t for tho&s;e indi&s;pen&s;able parts of polite education, Geography and Hi&s;tory. I expect that you will carefully attend to tho&s;e &s;ciences, and that you will not &s;uffer your&s;elf, as you read my Let|ters, to be carried away by the rapid &s;tream of idle curio&s;ity from incident to incident, without time or di&s;po&s;ition for reflection: you mu&s;t take excur&s;ions, as you go along, from my Letters to your Geographical Grammar and your Maps&mdash;and, when nece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ary, call in the aid of your Tutor, in order to compare my ob|&s;ervations with tho&s;e of others on the &s;ame places, and by tho&s;e means to acquire as determinate an idea as po&s;&s;ible of their local &s;ituation, laws, and comparative advantages, whether of Nature or Art. You will thus enable your&s;elf hereafter to con&s;ider how &s;ociety is influenced, and why &s;ome communities are better directed than others.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="031911_0018_0FEF48B9B240C6D0">Here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that as geography is a &s;cience to which rational conver&s;ation, as &s;upported by gentlemen of breeding and education, mo&s;t fre|quently refers, the lea&s;t, ignorance of it is continually liable to detection, and, when detected, &s;ubjects a man to the mo&s;t mortifying ridicule and contempt.</P>
<P>The ingenious GEORGE ALEXANDER STEEVENS has, in his celebrated Lecture upon Heads, given a mo&s;t ludicrous in&s;tance of this &s;pecies of ignorance, in the character of a citizen, who, cen&s;uring the incapa|city of mini&s;ters, propo&s;es to carry on the war on a new plan of his own. The plan is, to put the troops in cork jackets&mdash;&s;end them, thus equipped, to &s;ea&mdash; and <HI>land them in the Mediterranean:</HI> When his com|panion a&s;ks him where that place lies, he calls him <HI>fool,</HI> and informs him that the Mediterranean is the capital of Con&s;tantinople. Thus, my dear &s;on, has this &s;atiri&s;t ridiculed ignorance in pretenders to educa|tion; and thus will every one be ridiculous who be|trays a deficiency in this very indi&s;pen&s;able ingredient in forming the character of a gentleman. But a &s;tory which I heard from a per&s;on of &s;trict veracity, will &s;erve more &s;trongly to &s;hew you the &s;hame attendant on ignorance of tho&s;e things which, from our rank, we are &s;uppo&s;ed to know; and as the fear of &s;hame never fails to operate powerfully on a generous mind, I am &s;ure it will &s;erve to alarm you into indu&s;try, and ap|plication to your &s;tudies.</P>
<P>During the late American war, about that period when the KING of FRANCE was, &s;o fatally for him|&s;elf, though perhaps in the end it may prove fortunate for the intere&s;ts of mankind, manife&s;ting an intention to interfere and join the Americans, a worthy alder|man in Dublin, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ding the new&s;paper, ob&s;erved a pa|ragraph, intimating, that in con&s;equence of Briti&s;h crui&s;ers having &s;topped &s;ome French ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea, and &s;earched them, France had taken <HI>umbrage!</HI> The &s;aga|cious

<P>Thus, my child, will every one be more or le&s;s ridi|culous who appears obviou&s;ly ignorant of tho&s;e things which, from the rank he holds in life, he &s;hould be expected to know, or to the knowledge of which va|nity or petulence may tempt him to pretend.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure I need not &s;ay more to you on this &s;ub|ject; for I think you love me too well to di&s;appoint me in the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart, and I believe you have too much manly pride to &s;uffer &s;o degrading a defect as indolence to expo&s;e you hereafter to animad|ver&s;ion or contempt. Remember, that as nothing in this life, however trivial or worthle&s;s, is to be procu|red without labour&mdash;&s;o, above all others, the weighty and invaluable trea&s;ures of erudition are only to be ac|quired by exertions vigorou&s;ly made and unremittingly continued.</P>

If, then, the edu|cation of youth intere&s;ts &s;o very deeply a &s;tate, can it le&s;s powerfully intere&s;t him who &s;tands in the twofold connection of a citizen and parent? It is the lively anxiety of my mind, on this point, that obliges me to procra&s;tinate the commencement of my narrative to another letter, and induces me to entreat that you will, in the mean time, give this the con&s;ideration it de&s;erves, and prepare your mind to follow its in&s;truc|tions.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>A VARIETY of unpropitious circum&s;tances gave ri&s;e to my journey to the Ea&s;t Indies, while do|me&s;tic calamity marked my departure, and, at the very out&s;et, gave me a foreta&s;te of tho&s;e mi&s;eries which fate had re&s;erved to let fall upon me in the &s;equel. The channels from which I drew the means of &s;up|porting my family in that &s;tyle which their rank and connections obliged them to maintain, were clogged by a coincidence of events as unlucky as unexpected: the war in India had interrupted the regular remit|tance of my property from thence: a &s;evere &s;hock which unbounded genero&s;ity and beneficence had given to the affairs of my father, rendered him incapable of maintaining his u&s;ual punctuality in the payment of the income he had a&s;&s;igned me; and, to crown the whole, I had been deprived, by death, of two lovely children (your brother and &s;i&s;ter), whom I loved not le&s;s than I have &s;ince loved you and your brother.</P>
<P>It was under the pre&s;&s;ure of tho&s;e accumulated af|flictions, aggravated by the goading thought of leav|ing my family for &s;uch a length of time as mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily elap&s;e before I could again &s;ee them, that I &s;et out for India in the month of May, in the year 1781, with a heart overwhelmed with woe, and too &s;urely predictive of misfortunes.</P>
<P>From the gloomy cave of depre&s;&s;ion in which my mind was &s;unk, I looked forward, to &s;eek, in the fu|ture, a gleam of comfort&mdash;but in vain: not a ray ap|peared
<PB N="26" REF="031911_0022_0FEF48F828155658">
&mdash;Melancholy had thrown her &s;ombre &s;hadow on the whole. Even pre&s;ent affliction yielded up a &s;hare of my heart to an unaccountable di&s;mal pre&s;enti|ment of future ill; and the di&s;a&s;ters and di&s;appoint|ments I had pa&s;&s;ed, were lo&s;t and forgotten in ominous forebodings and in&s;tinctive pre&s;ages of tho&s;e that were to come.</P>
<P>Of all the weakne&s;&s;es to which the human mind is &s;ubject, &s;uper&s;tition is that again&s;t which I would have you guard with the utmo&s;t vigilance. It is the mo&s;t incurable canker of the mind. Under its unrelenting dominion, happine&s;s withers, the under&s;tanding be|comes ob&s;cured, and every principle of joy is bla&s;ted. For this rea&s;on I wi&s;h to account for tho&s;e pre&s;ages, by referring them to their true phy&s;ical cau&s;es, in or|der thereby to prevent your young mind from receiv|ing, from what I have written, any injurious impre&s;|&s;ion, or &s;uper&s;titious idea of <HI>pre&s;entiment,</HI> as it is fa&s;hionably denominated.</P>
<P>If the mind of man be examined, it will be found naturally prone to the contemplation of the future&mdash; its flights from hope to hope, or fear to fear, leading it in&s;en&s;ibly from objects pre&s;ent and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to tho&s;e remote and in expectation&mdash;from po&s;itive good to &s;uppo&s;itious better, or from actual melancholy to imaginary misfortune. In the&s;e ca&s;es, the mind never fails to &s;ee the pro&s;pect in colours derived from the medium through which it is viewed and exaggerated by the magnifying power of fancy. Thus my mind, labouring under all the unea&s;ine&s;s I have de&s;cribed, &s;aw every thing through the gloomy medium of me|lancholy, and, looking forward, foreboded nothing but misfortune: accident afterwards fulfilled tho&s;e forebodings; but accident, nay, the mo&s;t trifling change of circum&s;tances, might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;o totally changed the face of my &s;ub&s;equent progre&s;s, that good fortune, in&s;tead of mi&s;adventure, might have been my
<PB N="27" REF="031911_0023_0FEF48F9B7504F10">
lot, and &s;o all my foreboding been as illu&s;ory and fal|lible as all &s;uch phantoms of the imagination really are. Thus I argue now&mdash;and I am &s;ure I argue truly; but if rea&s;on be not timely called in, and made, as it were, an habitual inmate, it avails but little again&s;t the overbearing force of &s;uper&s;tition, who, when &s;he once gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, holds her &s;eat with unrelenting tenacity, and, calling in a whole ho&s;t of horrors, with de&s;pair at their head, to her aid, entrenches her&s;elf behind their formidable powers, and bids defiance to the a&s;&s;aults of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus it fared with me&mdash;Under the dominion of a gloomy pre&s;entiment, I left London; and my journey down to Margate, where I was to take &s;hipping, was, as SHAKSPEARE emphatically &s;ays,
<Q>a phanta&s;m, or a hideous dream&mdash;and my little &s;tate of man &s;uffer|ed, as it were, the nature of an in&s;urrection:</Q>
&mdash; the chaos within me forbade even the approach of di&s;|criminate reflection; and I found my&s;elf on board the packet, bound to O&s;tend, without having a &s;ingle trace left upon my mind, of the intermediate &s;tages and incidents that happened &s;ince I had left London.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved&mdash;and I wi&s;h you always to carry it in memory, as one of the be&s;t con&s;olations un|der affliction&mdash;that human &s;ufferings, like all other things, find their vital principle exhau&s;ted, and their extinction accelerated, by overgrowth; and that, at the moment when man thinks him&s;elf mo&s;t mi&s;erable, a benignant Providence is preparing relief, in &s;ome form or other, for him. So it, in &s;ome &s;ort, happened with me; for I was fortunate enough to find in the packet a fellow-pa&s;&s;enger, whole valuable conver&s;ation and agreeable manners beguiled me in&s;en&s;ibly of the gloomy contemplation in which I was ab&s;orbed, and afforded my tortured mind a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of pain. This gentleman was General LOCKHART: he was going to Bru&s;&s;els, to pay his court to the Em|peror
<PB N="28" REF="031911_0024_0FEF48FC5CBA3B98">
JOSEPH the Second, who was then &s;hortly ex|pected in the Low Countries, in order to go through the ceremonies of his inauguration. As Bru&s;&s;els lay in my way, I was flattered with the hopes of having for a companion a gentleman at once &s;o plea&s;ing in his manners and re&s;pectable in his character, and was much comforted when I found him as much di&s;po&s;ed as my&s;elf to an agreement to travel the whole of the way thither together. Thus, though far, very far from a &s;tate of ea&s;e, I was, when landing at O&s;tend, at lea&s;t le&s;s mi&s;erable than at my coming on board the packet.</P>
<P>As this letter is already &s;pun to a length too great to admit of any material part of the de&s;cription I am now to give you of O&s;tend, and the country to which it belongs, I think it better to po&s;tpone it to my next, which I mean to devote entirely to that &s;ubject, and thereby avoid the confu&s;ion that ari&s;es from mixing two &s;ubjects in the &s;ame letter, or breaking off the thread of one in order to make way for the other.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear boy!&mdash;Forget not your brother JOHN. That you may both be good and happy, is all the wi&s;h now left to, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THAT country to which I am now to call your attention&mdash;I mean, the Netherlands&mdash;is marked by a greater number of political changes, and hara&s;&s;ed by a more continued train of military operations, than perhaps any country in the records of modern hi&s;tory. It may truly be called the Cockpit Royal of Europe, on which tyrants, as ambition, avarice, pride, ca|price, or malignity, prompted them, pitted thou&s;ands, and hundreds of thou&s;ands, of their fellow-creatures, to cut each other's throats about &s;ome point, frivolous as regarding them&s;elves, unimportant to mankind, and only tending to gratify a diabolical lu&s;t for dominion: Yet, under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, (&s;uch are the natu|ral qualities of this country), it has, till lately, been in a tolerably flouri&s;hing &s;tate; and would, under a good government and proper protection, equal any part of Europe for richne&s;s.</P>
<P>Flanders, Brabant, and the country now called the United Netherlands, were in general known by the name of Netherlands, Low Countries, or Pa&iuml;s-bas, from their &s;ituation, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, in re&s;pect of Germany. Anciently, they formed a part of Belgic Gaul, of which you may remember to have read an account in the Commentaries of JULIUS CAESAR, who de&s;cribes the inhabitants as the mo&s;t valiant of all the Gallic Nations&mdash;
<Q>Horum omnium Belgae &s;unt forti&s;|&s;imi.</Q>
They afterwards were &s;ubject to petty princes, and made part of the German Empire; and,
<PB N="30" REF="031911_0026_0FEF490226AB1BE0">
in the &s;ixteenth century, became &s;ubject to CHARLES the Fifth of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; but, being oppre&s;&s;|ed beyond endurance by his &s;on, PHILIP the Second of Spain, (that blind and furious bigot), they openly revolted&mdash;flew to arms to a&s;&s;ert their freedom; and, after a &s;truggle as glorious in effect as virtuous in principle&mdash;after performing prodigies of valour, and exhibiting examples of fortitude, to which none but men fighting in the godlike cau&s;e of LIBERTY are competent&mdash;led on by the wi&s;dom and valour of the PRINCE of ORANGE, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the SOVEREIGN of GREAT BRITAIN&mdash;they at length &s;o far &s;ucceed|ed, that tho&s;e now called the United Netherlands, entered into a &s;olemn league, and forced the gloomy tyrant to acknowledge their independence. But that part to which I am now particularly to allude, con|tinued annexed to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. In 1787, they revolted, and made a temporary &s;truggle to di&s;|engage them&s;elves from the dominion of the EMPE|ROR; but, owing to &s;ome cabals among them&s;elves, and the temperate conduct of that prince, they again returned to their allegiance, and were rewarded with a general amne&s;ty. In 1792, they were over-run by the French army under General DUMOURIER&mdash;open|ed their arms to tho&s;e republicans, and were rewarded for it by oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny, and inju&s;tice. The French, however, were driven back out of the coun|try; and, wonderful to relate, they again received their old ma&s;ter, the EMPEROR, with &s;trong demon|&s;trations of joy, and manife&s;ted their loyalty and at|tachment to him by every expre&s;&s;ion that abject hypo|cri&s;y could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>

<P>Human opinion is &s;o chequered and uncertain, that two very hone&s;t men may in certain ca&s;es act in direct contradiction and ho&s;tility to each other, with the very be&s;t intentions&mdash;He, therefore, mu&s;t have but a cold heart, and a contracted under&s;tanding, who cannot for|give the man that acts in &s;uch ca&s;es erroneou&s;ly, when he acts from the exact dictates of his opinion, and upon the principle which he has con&s;cientiou&s;ly adopt|ed: but when a whole people are &s;een whi&s;king about with every gu&s;t of fortune, and making a new prin|ciple for every new point of convenience, we mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e them even when they happen to act right, and can &s;carcely afford them &s;o much as pity in their ca|lamities. The Au&s;trian Netherlands are now in that &s;tate; and, without pre&s;uming to &s;ay in which of their tergiver&s;ations they were right, I will venture to pro|nounce that they de&s;erve puni&s;hment, and I believe they are in hands very likely to give them their due.</P>

It was, at one time, the &s;tronge&s;t town in Flanders: but a double ditch and ramparts, which con&s;tituted its &s;trength, are now de&s;troyed; and in the place where the former &s;tood, docks, or rather ba&s;ons, extremely capacious and commodious, are formed, for the recep|tion of &s;hipping. The ground about the town is very low and mar&s;hy, and cut into a number of fine canals &mdash;into &s;ome of which, &s;hips of the large&s;t &s;ize may en|ter&mdash;and in one of which, ve&s;&s;els of great burthen may ride, even clo&s;e to Bruges.

&s;o fortunately circum&s;tanced, that it was once thought, by engineers, entirely &s;ecure from a blockade; and its pri&s;tine &s;trength can in no way be &s;o well de&s;cribed, as by a relation of the defence it made in the four fir&s;t years of the &s;eventeenth century&mdash;though, near the clo&s;e of the &s;ixteenth, it was no better than an in&s;ignificant fi&s;hing town. It held out again&s;t the Spaniards for three years, two months, and &s;ixteen days. Eighty thou&s;and men lo&s;t their lives before it, while fifty thou&s;and were killed or died within. It at la&s;t &s;ur|rendered, but on good terms; and not for want of men or provi&s;ions, but for want of ground to &s;tand on, which the enemy took from them, at an amazing lo&s;s, &s;tep by &s;tep, till they had not room left for men to defend it. Three hundred thou&s;and cannon-balls, of thirty pounds weight each, were fired again&s;t it; and the be&s;ieged often filled up the breaches made in their ramparts with heaps of dead bodies.</P>
<P>Such, my dear boy, are the miracles that men, animated with the all-&s;ubduing &s;pirit of Liberty, can perform&mdash;Liberty! that immediate jewel of the &s;oul &mdash;that fir&s;t moving principle of all the animal crea|tion&mdash;which, with equal power, influences the bird to beat the cage with its wings, and the lion to tear the bars of his impri&s;onment&mdash;the infant to &s;pring from the tender confinement of its nur&s;e, and the lean and &s;hrivelled pantaloon to crawl abroad, and fly the warmth and repo&s;e of his whole&s;ome chamber&mdash;Li|berty! which, for centuries enthralled by artifice and fraud, or lulled into a &s;lumber by the witching &s;pirit of prie&s;tcraft, now ri&s;es like a giant refre&s;hed with wine&mdash;in its great efforts for emancipation, de&s;troys and overturns &s;y&s;tems&mdash;but, when finding no re&s;i&s;t|ance, and matured by time, will, I &s;incerely hope, &s;ink appea&s;ed into a generous calm, and become the ble&s;|&s;ing, the guardian and protector of mankind!</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="031911_0029_0FEF490AF56910B0">It is your good fortune, my dear children, to be born at a time when Liberty &s;eems to be well under|&s;tood in your own country, and is univer&s;ally the pre|valent pa&s;&s;ion of men.

<P>THE pride of the Engli&s;h is remarked all over the globe, even to a proverb! But pride is a word of &s;uch dubious meaning, &s;o undefined in its &s;en&s;e, and &s;trained to &s;uch various imports, that you &s;hall hear it violently execrated by one, and warmly applauded by another&mdash;this denouncing it as a &s;in of the fir&s;t magnitude, and that maintaining it to be the mo&s;t vigilant guardian of human virtue. Tho&s;e dif|ferences in opinion ari&s;e not from any defect in the intellects of either, but from each viewing the &s;ubject
<PB N="34" REF="031911_0030_0FEF490C8A73F6E0">
in that one point in which it fir&s;t &s;trikes his eye, or be&s;t &s;uits his ta&s;te, his feeling, or his prejudices. I have no doubt, however, but a full con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject would &s;hew, that pride, as it is called, is only good or bad as the object from which it ari&s;es is mean or magnificent, culpable or meritorious. That noble pride which &s;timulates to extraordinary acts of genero&s;ity and magnanimity, &s;uch as, in many in|&s;tances, has di&s;tingui&s;hed, above all others, the nobi|lity of Spain, exacts the homage and admiration of mankind: But I fear very much that our Engli&s;h pride is of another growth, and &s;mells too rankly of that over&s;trained commercial &s;pirit which makes the ba&s;is of the pre&s;ent grandeur of Great Britain, but which, in my humble judgment, rai&s;es only to deba&s;e her&mdash;by &s;low, &s;ubtle degrees, poi&s;ons the national principle, en&s;laves the once bold &s;pirit of the people, detracts from their real &s;olid felicity, and, by con|founding the idea of national wealth with that of na|tional pro&s;perity, leads it in rapid &s;trides to its down|fall. In &s;hort, we are approaching, I fear, with daily accelerated &s;teps, to the di&s;po&s;ition and &s;ordid habits of the Dutch, of whom Doctor GOLDSMITH &s;o very pertinently and truly &s;peaks, when he &s;ays,
<Q>"Ev'n Liberty it&s;elf is barter'd here!"</Q></P>
<P>Without leading your mind through a maze of di&s;|qui&s;ition on this &s;ubject, which might fatigue with ab|&s;tru&s;ene&s;s and prolixity, I will bring you back to the point from which the matter &s;tarted, and content my|&s;elf with remarking, that the pride of the Engli&s;h, &s;peaking of it as a part of the national character, is the meane&s;t of all pride. The inflation of bloated, overgrown wealth, an over-weening affection for mo|ney, an idolatrous wor&s;hip of gain, have ab&s;olutely confounded the general intellect, and warped the judgment of the many to that exce&s;s, that, in e&s;tima|ting

men or things, they refer always to "what is he worth?" or, "what will it fetch?" This &s;ordid ha|bit of thinking was finely bit off by a keen fellow, the native of a neighbouring kingdom, who, for many years, carried on bu&s;ine&s;s in London, and failed:&mdash; Sitting one day in a coffee-hou&s;e in the city, where &s;ome wealthy citizens were di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a &s;ubject not en|tirely unconnected with ca&s;h concerns, one of them ob&s;erving him rather attentive to their conver&s;ation, turned to him, and &s;aid, "What is your opinion, Sir, of the matter?"&mdash;"'s blood, Sir!" returned he, peevi&s;hly, "what opinion can a man have in this country, who has not a guinea in his pocket?"</P>
<P>Under the influence of all the various caprices in|&s;pired by this unhappy pur&s;e-pride, I am &s;orry to &s;ay our countrymen do, when they go abroad, &s;o play the fool, that they are univer&s;ally flattered and de&s;pi&s;ed, pillaged and laughed at, by all per&s;ons with whom they have any dealing. In France, Mi Lor Anglois is, or at lea&s;t was, to have &s;ix times as great a profu|&s;ion of every thing as any other per&s;on, and pay three hundred per cent. more for it; and the wor&s;t of it was, that a Mi Lor was found &s;o conducive to their intere&s;t, that they would not, if they could help it, &s;uffer any Engli&s;hman to go without a title&mdash;nay, would &s;ometimes, with kindly compul&s;ion, force him to accept of it, whether he would or not: but if an Engli&s;hman be, above all others, the object of impo|&s;ition in foreign countries, certainly none pillage him &s;o unmercifully as his own countrymen who are &s;et|tled there. In all the places through which I have travelled, I have had occa&s;ion to remark (and the re|mark has been amply verified by every gentleman I have ever conver&s;ed with on the &s;ubject), that the mo&s;t extravagant hou&s;es of entertainment are tho&s;e kept by Engli&s;hmen. At O&s;tend, as well as other places, it was &s;o: therefore, as economy, when it

<P>It is a &s;ingular circum&s;tance, and belongs, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, peculiarly to O&s;tend, that the charity-children of the town are permitted to come on board the ve&s;&s;els arrived, to beg of the pa&s;&s;engers, one day in the week.</P>
<P>Before I bid adieu to O&s;tend, I mu&s;t remark one heavy di&s;advantage under which it labours&mdash;the want of fre&s;h water; all they u&s;e being brought from Bruges. In going from O&s;tend to Bruges, a traveller has it in his choice to go by land, or water&mdash;If by land, he gets a good voiture for about ten &s;hillings of our money; the road is about fourteen or fifteen miles&mdash;If by water (the mode which I adopted, as by far the cheape&s;t and the plea&s;ante&s;t), he travels in a ve&s;&s;el pret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch re&s;embling our Lord Mayor's barge, &s;ometimes called a track&s;chuyt, but often la barque, or barke: it is, in truth, fitted up in a &s;tyle of great neatne&s;s, if not elegance; &s;tored with a large &s;tock of provi&s;ions and refre&s;hments of all kinds, and of &s;upe|rior quality, for the accommodation of the pa&s;&s;engers; and has, particularly, a very hand&s;ome private room between decks, for the company to retire to, in order to drink tea, coffee, &amp;c. &amp;c. or play at cards.

Enter|ing the town of Bruges, we were &s;topped by a centi|nel, who, with all the &s;aucy, &s;waggering air of autho|rity, of a &s;lave in office, demanded to know, whether we had any contraband goods? whether we were in any military capacity? whence we came? and whither we were going? with a variety of other interrogato|ries, to my mind equally impertinent and dete&s;table,

<P>IN my la&s;t, I carried you pa&s;t a ferocious, impertinent &s;entinel, into the town of Bruges; and now, having got you there, I mu&s;t endeavour, from the loo&s;e materials I have been able to collect, to give you a &s;hort de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>I had heard much of Bruges, its grandeur, and its opulence; you will gue&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e then, when, on entering it, I found nothing but an old-fa&s;hioned, ill-built, irregular town; the &s;treets, in general, narrow and dirty, and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of poverty and &s;qualid wretchedne&s;s: yet this was anciently a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city. Did the difference between the town at this time, and its &s;tate as it is repre&s;ented of old, con&s;i&s;t only in its external appear|ance, we might readily account for that, in the great improvements made by the moderns in the art of hou&s;e-building; but its pre&s;ent inferiority goes deep|er, and is the re&s;ult of departed commerce&mdash;com|merce, that fluctuating will-with-a-wi&s;p, that leads &s;tates in hot pur&s;uit after it, to entrap them ulti|mately into mires and precipices, and which, when caught, &s;tays till it extingui&s;hes the &s;pirit of freedom in a nation, refines its people into feeble &s;laves, and there leaves them to poverty and contempt.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is no &s;ubject that affords an ampler field for a &s;peculative mind to expatiate upon, than the various, and, I may &s;ay, incongruous revolutions which have chequered the progre&s;s of human &s;ociety
<PB N="40" REF="031911_0036_0FEF491C4E8E70C0">
from the fir&s;t records of hi&s;tory down to the pre&s;ent time. It is indeed a &s;peculation which not only tends to improve the under&s;tanding, by calling in experience to correct the illu&s;ions of theory, but is highly in&s;truc|tive in a moral point of view, by pointing out the in|&s;tability of the very be&s;t &s;trictures of human wi&s;dom, and teaching us how little reliance is to be placed upon human ca&s;ualties, or earthly contingencies. Look to Greece, once the fountain-head of arts, eloquence, and learning, and the mother of freedom&mdash;her poets, her legi&s;lators, her &s;oldiers, and her patriots, even to this day con&s;idered the brighte&s;t examples of earthly glory!&mdash;&s;ee her now &s;unk in &s;lavery, ignorance, &s;loth, and imbecility, below any petty nation of Europe. Look to Rome&mdash;in her turn, the queen of arms and arts, the land of liberty, the nur&s;e of heroes&mdash;the &s;tage on which inflexible patriots, accompli&s;hed philo|&s;ophers, and a free people, acted for centuries a drama that elevated man almo&s;t above his nature!&mdash; &s;ee her now reduced to the la&s;t &s;tage of contemptibi|lity&mdash;even below it, to ridicule and laughter&mdash;&s;wayed by the mo&s;t contemptible impo&s;ture, and &s;unk into the mo&s;t de&s;picable en&s;lavement, both of per&s;on and opinion&mdash;the offices of her glorious &s;enate performed by a kind of heteroclite being, an hermaphroditical impo&s;tor, who, deducing his right from the very dregs and offscourings of &s;uper&s;tition and fanatici&s;m, and aided by a &s;et of di&s;ciples worthy of &s;uch a ma&s;ter, rules the people, not with the terrors of the Tar|peian rock, nor yet with that which to a Roman bo&s;om was more terrible, bani&s;hment&mdash;but with the horrors of <HI>eternal damnation!</HI>&mdash;&s;ee her valiant, vigo|rous &s;oldiery converted into a band of feeble fidlers and mu&s;ic-ma&s;ters, and the clangor of her arms into &s;hrill concerts of &s;queaking ca&s;tratoes; tho&s;e places where her CICERO poured forth eloquence divine, and pointed out the paths that led to true morality&mdash;
<PB N="41" REF="031911_0037_0FEF491E03BD32F8">
where her BRUTUS and her CATO mar&s;halled the forces of freedom, and rai&s;ed the arm of ju&s;tice again&s;t tyrants, over-run by a knavi&s;h ho&s;t of ignorant, beg|garly, bald-pated friars, vomiting, to a crowd of gaping bigots, torrents of fanatical bomba&s;t, of mira|cles never performed, of gods made of wood or cop|per, and of &s;aints, that, like them&s;elves, lived by im|po&s;ture and deception!&mdash;&s;ee her triumphs and mili|tary trophies changed into proce&s;&s;ions of prie&s;ts &s;inging p&s;alms round wafers and wooden crucifixes; and that code of Philo&s;ophy and religion, which operated &s;o effec|tually upon the morals of her people that there was none among them found &s;o de&s;perate or &s;o ba&s;e as to break an oath, exchanged for the Roman Catholic branch of the Chri&s;tian Faith&mdash;for di&s;pen&s;ations for ince&s;t, indulgences for murder, fines for fornication, and an exclu&s;ive patent for adultery in their prie&s;t|hood. Then look to England!&mdash;&s;ee her, who once &s;tooped beneath the yoke of Rome, who&s;e chief, CARACTACUS, was carried there in chains to grace his conqueror's triumphs, while her&s;elf was made the meane&s;t of the Roman provinces, now holding the ba|lance of the world, the unrivalled mi&s;tre&s;s of arms, arts, commerce&mdash;every thing.</P>
<P>It was in this irre&s;i&s;tible mutation of things, that Bruges &s;unk from the high &s;tate of a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city, where there are &s;till (unle&s;s the French have de|&s;troyed them) to be &s;een the remains of &s;eventeen pa|laces, anciently the re&s;idences of con&s;uls of different nations, each of which had di&s;tinct hou&s;es, magnifi|cently built and furni&s;hed, with warehou&s;es for their merchandi&s;es: and &s;uch was the power and wealth of the citizens in tho&s;e days, that it is an indubitable fact, they kept their &s;overeign, the Archduke MAX|IMILIAN, pri&s;oner, affronted his &s;ervants, and abu&s;ed his officers; nor would they relea&s;e him until he took an oath to pre&s;erve inviolate the laws of the &s;tate.
<PB N="42" REF="031911_0038_0FEF492399DBCFE0">
Even &s;o late as the time I was there, Bruges had &s;ome trade&mdash;indeed as good a foreign trade as mo&s;t cities in Flanders. The people &s;eemed cheerful and happy, and the markets were tolerably &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Several fine canals run in a variety of directions from Bruges: by one of them, boats can go, in the cour&s;e of a &s;ummer's day, to O&s;tend, Nieuport, Furnes, and Dunkirk; and ve&s;&s;els of four hundred tuns can float in the ba&s;on of this town. Another canal leads to Ghent, another to Damme, and ano|ther to Sluys. The water of tho&s;e canals is &s;tagnant, without the lea&s;t motion; yet they can, in half an hour, be all emptied, and fre&s;h water brought in, by means of their well-contrived &s;luices. This water, however, is never u&s;ed for drinking, or even for culi|nary purpo&s;es; a better &s;ort being conveyed through the town by pipes from the two rivers Lys and Scheldt, as in London; for which, as there, every hou&s;e pays a certain tax.</P>
<P>Although the trade of this city has, like that of all the Low Countries, been gradually declining, and daily &s;ucked into the vortices of Briti&s;h and Dutch commerce, there were, till the French entered it, many rich merchants there, who met every day at noon in the great market-place, to communicate and tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s, which was chiefly done in the Fle|mi&s;h language, hardly any one in it &s;peaking French; a circum&s;tance that by this time is much altered&mdash;for they have been already made, if not to &s;peak French, at lea&s;t to &s;ing <HI>Ca-ira,</HI> and dance to the tune of it too, to &s;ome purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The once-famed grandeur of this city con&s;i&s;ted chiefly, like that of all grand places in the dark pe|riods of Popery, of the gloomy piles, the o&s;tentatious frippery, and unwieldy ma&s;&s;es of wealth, accumulated by a long &s;eries of monki&s;h impo&s;ture&mdash;of Gothic &s;tructures, of enormous &s;ize and &s;able a&s;pect, filled
<PB N="43" REF="031911_0039_0FEF49252E07E3C8">
with dreary cells, calculated to &s;trike the &s;ouls of the ignorant and enthu&s;ia&s;tic with holy horror, to in&s;pire awe of the places, and veneration for the per&s;ons who dared to inhabit them, and, by enfeebling the rea&s;on with the mixed operations of horror, wonder, and re|verence, to fit the credulous for the reception of every impo&s;ition, however gro&s;s in conception, or bungled in execution. Tho&s;e are the things which con&s;tituted the greatne&s;s and &s;plendor of the cities of ancient Chri&s;tendom; to tho&s;e has the &s;turdie&s;t hu|man vigour and intellect been forced to bend the knees: they were built to endure the outrages of time; and will &s;tand, I am &s;ure, long, long after their power &s;hall have been annihilated.</P>
<P>What a powerful engine has &s;uper&s;tition been, in the cunning management of prie&s;ts! How lamentable it is to think, that not only all who believed, but all who had good &s;en&s;e enough not to believe, &s;hould, for &s;o many centuries, have been kept in pro&s;trate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will and dominion of an old man in Rome!&mdash;My blu&s;hes for the folly and &s;upinene&s;s of mankind, however, are lo&s;t in a warm glow of tran&s;|port at the pre&s;ent irradiation of the human mind; and though I can &s;carcely think with patience of that glorious, godlike being, HENRY the Second of Eng|land, being obliged by the Pope to la&s;h him&s;elf naked at the tomb of that &s;aucy, wicked prie&s;t, THOMAS A BECKET, I felicitate my&s;elf with the reflection, that the Pope is now the mo&s;t contemptible &s;overeign in Europe, and that the Papal authority, which was once the terror and the &s;courge of the earth, is now not only not recogni&s;ed, but &s;eldom thought of, and, when thought of, only &s;erves to excite laughter or di&s;gu&s;t.</P>

<P>THE town of Bruges, although the &s;treets be, as I have already de&s;cribed them, &s;o mean, nar|row, dirty, and irregular in general, contains, never|thele&s;s, &s;ome few &s;treets that are tolerable, and a few &s;quares al&s;o that are far from contemptible.&mdash;I &s;hould think it, neverthele&s;s, not worth another letter of de|&s;cription, were it not that the churches, and church-curio&s;ities, demand our attention; for you will ob|&s;erve, that in all rich Popi&s;h countries, every church is a holy toy-&s;hop, or rather a mu&s;eum, where pic|tures, &s;tatues, gold cups, &s;ilver candle&s;ticks, diamond crucifixes, and gods, of various &s;orts and dimen&s;ions, are hoarded up, in honour of the Supreme Being. This city having been for centuries the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Mecklin, and at the &s;ame time hereditary chancellor of Flanders, it is not to be wondered at, if eccle&s;ia&s;tical indu&s;try &s;hould have ama&s;&s;ed &s;ome of tho&s;e little trinkets which con&s;titute the chief or only value of their church. The mitre of this place conveys to the head that wears it a dioce&s;e containing &s;ix cities, from the names of which you will be able to form &s;ome &s;mall judgment of the opulence of one poor &s;on of ab&s;ti|nence and mortification.&mdash;Tho&s;e cities are, in the fir&s;t place, Bruges it&s;elf, then O&s;tend, Sluys, Damme, Middleburgh in Flanders, and Oudenberch&mdash;not to mention one hundred and thirty-three boroughs and villages; and if you could compute the number of in|ferior
<PB N="45" REF="031911_0041_0FEF492CA62ECBA8">
clergy with which the &s;treets and highways are filled, you would be thunder&s;truck. There, and in all tho&s;e Popi&s;h countries, they may be &s;een, with grote&s;que habits and bald pates, buzzing up and down like bees, in &s;warms, (a precious hive!)&mdash;and, with the mo&s;t vehement prote&s;tations of voluntary poverty in their mouths, and eyes uplifted to Heaven, &s;cram|bling for the good things of the earth with the eager|ne&s;s of a pack of hounds, and the rapacity of a whole roll of lawyers! With loaded thighs (I might &s;ay, loaded arms too, for they have large pockets even in their &s;leeves, for the concealment of moveables), they return to the great hive, where, contrary to the law of bees, the drone lives in idle &s;tate, and he plunders them: contrary, too, to the habits of tho&s;e u&s;eful in|&s;ects, they bani&s;h the queen-bee, and &s;uffer no female to approach their cells, but keep them in contiguous hives, where, under cover of the night, they vi&s;it them, and fulfil in private that which they deny in public&mdash;the great command of Providence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t building in nominal rank, though by no means the fir&s;t in value, is the great cathedral, which has at lea&s;t bulk, antiquity, and gloomine&s;s enough to recommend it to the faithful. It is by no means un|furni&s;hed within, though not in &s;o remarkable a man|ner as to induce me to fill a letter with it. In a word, it is an old Popi&s;h cathedral, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed wanting in wealth: at the time I write, it has been &s;tanding no le&s;s a time than nine hundred and twenty-nine years, having been built in the year 865.</P>
<P>The next that occurs to me, as worthy of notice, is the church of Notre Dame, or that dedicated to <HI>our Lady</HI> the Virgin MARY. This is really a beau|tiful &s;tructure of the kind&mdash;indeed magnificent. Its &s;teeple is beyond conception &s;tupendous, being &s;o very high as to be &s;een at &s;ea off O&s;tend, although it is not elevated in the &s;malle&s;t degree by any ri&s;e in the
<PB N="46" REF="031911_0042_0FEF492E3A1C05B8">
ground; for, &s;o very flat is the whole intermediate country, that I believe it would puzzle a &s;kilful level|ler to find two feet elevation from high-water-mark at O&s;tend up to this city. The contents of this church are corre&s;pondent to its external appearance&mdash;being enriched and beautified with a va&s;t variety of &s;acerdo|tal trinkets, and fine tombs and monuments. As to the former, the ve&s;tments of that &s;ame THOMAS A BECKET whom I mentioned in my la&s;t, make a part of the curio&s;ities depo&s;ited in this church: this furious and inflexible impo&s;tor was archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury; and his &s;truggles to en&s;lave both the king and people of England, and make them tributary to the Pope, have canonized him, and obtained the very ho|nourable depot I mention for his ve&s;tments. To do ju&s;tice, however, to the &s;pirit and &s;agacity of the holy fathers who have &s;o long taken the pains to pre&s;erve them, it mu&s;t be commemorated, that they are, or at lea&s;t were &s;et with diamonds, and other precious &s;tones! Probably, among the many prie&s;ts who have, in &s;o many centuries, had the cu&s;tody of tho&s;e divine relics, &s;ome one, more &s;agacious than the re&s;t, might conceive, that, to lie in a church, and be &s;een by the all-believing eyes of the faithful, a little coloured gla&s;s was ju&s;t as good as any precious &s;tone, and wi&s;ely have converted the originals to &s;ome better purpo&s;e. If &s;o, it will be &s;ome con&s;olation to Holy Mother Church to reflect, that &s;he has bilked the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns-culottes,</HI> who certainly have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saint THOMAS A BECKET's &s;acerdotal petticoats; and, if they have been found enough to &s;tand the cutting, have, by this time, converted them into comfortable campaigning breeches. O mon&s;trous! wicked! abominable!&mdash; that the Royal MARY, &s;i&s;ter to the great Emperor CHARLES the Fifth, &s;hould, &s;o long ago as the Re|formation, have bought at an immen&s;e price, and de|po&s;ited in the trea&s;ury of the church of <HI>our Lady</HI> the
<PB N="47" REF="031911_0043_0FEF49318A5A2198">
ble&s;&s;ed Virgin MARY, the ve&s;tments of a &s;aint, only to make breeches, in the year 1794, for a French &s;ol|dier! The time has been, when the bare &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;uch &s;acrilege would have turned the brain of half the people of Chri&s;tendom: but tho&s;e things are now better managed.</P>
<P>Of the tombs in this church, I &s;hall only mention two, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by their co&s;tline&s;s, magnificence, and antiquity. They are made of cop|per, well gilt. One of them is the tomb of MARY, heire&s;s to the Ducal Hou&s;e of Burgundy; and the other, that of CHARLES (commonly called <HI>the Har|dy</HI>), Duke of Burgundy, her father.</P>
<P>In Bruges there were four great abbeys, and an amazing number of convents and nunneries. The buildings, I pre&s;ume, yet &s;tand; but there is little doubt that their contents, of every kind, have been, before this, put <HI>in requi&s;ition,</HI> and each part of them, of cour&s;e, applied to its natural u&s;e.</P>
<P>The church once belonging to the Je&s;uits, is built in a noble &s;tyle of architecture: and that of the Do|minicans has not only its external merits, but its in|ternal value; for, be&s;ides the u&s;ual &s;uperabundance of rich chalices, &amp;c. it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome very great cu|rio&s;ities&mdash;</P>
<P>As, fir&s;t, a very curious, highly wrought pulpit&mdash; beautiful in it&s;elf, but remarkable for the top being &s;upported by wood, cut out, in the mo&s;t natural, de|ceptive manner, in the form of ropes, and which beguile the &s;pectator the more into a belief of its reality, becau&s;e it an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of ropes.</P>
<P>Secondly, a picture&mdash;and &s;o extraordinary a pic|ture! Before I de&s;cribe it, I mu&s;t appri&s;e you that your faith mu&s;t be almo&s;t as great as that of a Spa|ni&s;h Chri&s;tian to believe me&mdash;to believe that the hu|man intellect ever &s;unk &s;o low as, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to conceive, and, in the next, to harbour and admire,
<PB N="48" REF="031911_0044_0FEF49331E758028">
&s;uch a piece. But I mi&s;take&mdash;it has its merit; it is a curio&s;ity&mdash;the demon of &s;atire him&s;elf could not wi&s;h for a greater.</P>
<P>This picture, then, is the repre&s;entation of a mar|riage!&mdash;but of whom? why, truly, of JESUS CHRIST with Saint CATHARINE of Sienna. Ob&s;erve the con|gruity&mdash;Saint CATHARINE of Sienna lived many centuries after the tran&s;lation of JESUS CHRIST to Heaven, where he is to &s;it, you know, till he comes to judge the quick and the dead!&mdash;But who marries them? In truth, Saint DOMINIC, the patron of this church! The Virgin MARY joins their hands&mdash;that is not ami&s;s&mdash;But, to crown the whole, King DAVID him&s;elf, who died &s;o long before CHRIST was born, plays the harp at the wedding!</P>
<P>My dear FREDERICK, I &s;hall take it as no &s;mall in&s;tance of your dutiful opinion of me to believe, that &s;uch a picture exi&s;ted, and made part of the holy paraphernalia of a temple con&s;ecrated to the wor&s;hip of the Divinity: but I a&s;&s;ure you it is a fact; and as I have never given you rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect my veracity, I expect you to believe me in this in&s;tance, improba|ble though it &s;eems: for &s;uch a farrago of ab&s;urdities, &s;uch a jumble of incongruities, impo&s;&s;ibilities, bulls, and anachroni&s;ms, never yet were compre&s;&s;ed, by the human imagination, into the &s;ame narrow compa&s;s.</P>
<P>I protract this letter beyond my u&s;ual length, on purpo&s;e to conclude my account of Bruges, and get once more upon the road.</P>
<P>The mona&s;tery of the Carthu&s;ians, another order of friars, is of amazing &s;ize, covering an extent of ground not much le&s;s than a mile in circumference. The Carmelites, another order, have a church here, in which there is rai&s;ed a beautiful monument, to the memory of HENRY JERMYN, Lord Dover, a peer of England&mdash;But the mona&s;tery called the Dunes, a &s;ect of the order of Saint BERNARD, is by
<PB N="49" REF="031911_0045_0FEF3267785E11A8">
far the noble&s;t in the whole city: the cloi&s;ters and gardens are capacious and hand&s;ome; the apartment of the abbot is magnificent and &s;tately, and tho&s;e of the monks them&s;elves unu&s;ually neat. Tho&s;e poor mortified penitents, &s;ecluded from the pomps, the va|nities, and enjoyments of life, and their thoughts, no doubt re&s;ting alone on hereafter, keep, neverthele&s;s, a &s;umptuous table, &s;pread with every luxury of the &s;ea&s;on&mdash;have their country-&s;eats, where they go a-hunting, or to refre&s;h them&s;elves, and actually keep their own coaches.</P>
<P>Among the nunneries there are two Engli&s;h: one of Augu&s;tinian nuns, who are all ladies of quality, and who entertain &s;trangers at the grate with &s;weet-meats and wine; the other, called the Pelicans, is of a very &s;trict order, and wear a coar&s;e dre&s;s.</P>
<P>To conclude&mdash;In the chapel of Saint BASIL is &s;aid to be kept, in perfect pre&s;ervation, the blood which JOSEPH of Arimathea wiped off with a &s;ponge from the dead body of CHRIST. <HI>Finis coronat opus.</HI></P>
<P>I fancy you have, by this time, had as much of miracles as you can well dige&s;t: I therefore leave you to reflect upon them, and improve.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>AS I was going to the barque, at Bruges, to take my departure for Ghent, the next town in my route, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a number of officious, bu&s;y, poor fellows, crowding round my effects, and
<PB N="50" REF="031911_0046_0FEF4934B20298D8">
&s;eizing them&mdash;&s;ome my trunk, &s;ome my portmanteau, &amp;c. I believe two or three to each: but my a&s;toni&s;h|ment partly &s;ub&s;ided when I was told that they were porters, who plied on the canal, and about the city, for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and only came to have the <HI>honour</HI> of carrying my baggage down to the ve&s;&s;el. Noting their eagerne&s;s, I could not help &s;miling. I know there are tho&s;e, and I have heard of &s;uch, who would blu&s;ter at them: but my mirth at the bu&s;tling im|portance which the poor fellows affected, &s;oon &s;unk into &s;erious concern; I &s;aid within my&s;elf, "Alas, how hard mu&s;t be your lot indeed!" and my imagina|tion was in an in&s;tant back again in London, where a porter often makes you pay for a job, not in money only, but in patience al&s;o, and where the &s;urline&s;s of independence &s;cowls upon his brow as he does your work. Every one of my men demanded a remunera|tion for his labour: one man could have ea&s;ily done the work of five&mdash;but I re&s;olved not to &s;end them away di&s;contented: he is but a &s;ordid churl that would; and I paid them to their full &s;atisfaction. Here, my dear FREDERICK, let me offer you (&s;ince it occurs) my parental advice on this point&mdash;from the practice of which you will gain more &s;olid felicity than you can po&s;&s;ibly be aware of now: never weigh &s;crupulou&s;ly the value of the work of the poor; rather exceed than fall &s;hort of rewarding it: it is a very, very &s;mall thing, that will put them in good humour with you and with them&s;elves, and relax the hard furrows of labour into the &s;oft &s;mile of grati|tude&mdash;a &s;mile which, to a heart of &s;en&s;ibility &s;uch as yours, will, of it&s;elf, ten-thou&s;and fold repay you, even though the frequent practice of it &s;hould abridge you of a few of tho&s;e things called plea&s;ures, or de|tract a little from the weight of your pur&s;e.</P>
<P>Being again &s;eated in my barque, I &s;et off for Ghent, a city lying at a di&s;tance of twenty-four
<PB N="51" REF="031911_0047_0FEF49367AB70180">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iles from Bruges. I mu&s;t here remark to you, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Company one meets in tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els is not always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the fir&s;t rank; it is generally of a mixed, motley kind: but to a man who carries along with him, through his travels, a love for his fellow-creatures, and a de&s;ire to &s;ee men, and their cu&s;toms and man|ners, it is both plea&s;ant and eligible&mdash;at lea&s;t I thought it &s;o, and enjoyed it. There were tho&s;e among&s;t us who &s;poke rather loftily on that &s;ubject: I &s;aid no|thing; but it brought to my mind a reflection I have often had occa&s;ion to concur in, viz. that a fa&s;tidious u&s;urpation of dignity (happily denominated <HI>&s;tateline&s;s</HI>) is the never-failing mark of an up&s;tart or a blockhead. The man of true dignity, &s;elf-erect and &s;trong, needs not have recour&s;e, for &s;upport, to the comparative wretchedne&s;s of his fellow-creature, or plume him|&s;elf upon &s;purious &s;uperiority. You will under&s;tand me, however! When I &s;ay, "the man of true dig|nity," I am far, very far, from meaning a lord, a &s;quire, a banker, or a general officer&mdash;I mean a man of intrin&s;ic worth&mdash;homo emunct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> naris&mdash;one who, in every &s;tation into which chance may throw him, feels firm in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of right&mdash;who can &s;ee and cheri&s;h merit, though enveloped and concealed behind a &s;habby &s;uit of clothes&mdash;and who &s;corns the blown-up fool of fortune, that, without &s;en&s;e or &s;en|timent, without virtue, wi&s;dom, or courage, pre&s;umes to call him&s;elf great, merely becau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a few acres of earth which he had neither the indu&s;try nor merit to earn, or becau&s;e his great-great-great-grandfather purcha&s;ed a title by perfidy to his coun|try, the plunder of his fellow-citizens, or the &s;laugh|ter of mankind.</P>
<P>Although the face of that part of the country through which we are now pa&s;&s;ing, like that of the preceding &s;tage from O&s;tend to Bruges, wants diver|&s;ity, it has its charms, and would be particularly de|lightful
<PB N="52" REF="031911_0048_0FEF493CC0288AE8">
in the eye of an Engli&s;h farmer; for it is co|vered with the thicke&s;t verdure on each &s;ide of the canal, and the banks are decorated all along by row<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;tately trees, while the fields in the back ground are cultivated to the highe&s;t degree of perfection, and bear the a&s;pect of producing the mo&s;t abundant har|ve&s;t.</P>
<P>You will be able to form a judgment of the trifling expence of travelling in this country, from my ex|pences in this &s;tage of twenty-four miles. I had an excellent dinner for about fifteen pence of our money; my pa&s;&s;age co&s;t me but &s;ixteen more, amounting in all to two &s;hillings and &s;even pence: compare that with travelling in England, where one cannot ri&s;e up from an indifferent dinner, in an inn, under five &s;hillings at the lea&s;t, and you mu&s;t be a&s;toni&s;hed at the di&s;pro|portion.</P>
<P>Ghent is the capital of Flanders, and is to be rec|koned among the large&s;t cities of Europe, as it covers a &s;pace of ground of not le&s;s than &s;even miles in cir|cumference; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here is not above one half of that occupied with buildings, the greater part being thrown into fields, gardens, orchards, and plea&s;ure-grounds. Si|tuated on four navigable rivers, and inter&s;ected into no fewer than twenty-&s;ix i&s;lands by a number of ca|nals, which afford an ea&s;y, cheap, and expeditious carriage for weighty merchandize, it may be con&s;ider|ed, in point of local advantages for commerce, &s;upe|rior to mo&s;t cities in Europe; while tho&s;e i&s;lands are again united by about a hundred bridges, &s;ome great and &s;ome &s;mall, which contribute much to the beauty of the city.</P>
<P>To a man accu&s;tomed to mould his thoughts by what he &s;ees in Great Britain, the &s;trong fortifications that &s;urround almo&s;t all towns on the Continent con|vey the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations&mdash;reminding him of the fir&s;t mi&s;ery of mankind, War!&mdash;denoting,
<PB N="53" REF="031911_0049_0FEF493E535E8EA0">
alas! too truly, the di&s;po&s;ition of man to violate the rights of his fellow-creatures, and manife&s;ting the ty|rannous abu&s;e of power. On me, though trained and accu&s;tomed to military habits, this "dreadful note of preparation" had an unplea&s;ing effect; for, though born, bred, and habituated to the life of a &s;oldier, I find the feelings of the citizen and the man claim a paramount right to my heart.</P>
<P>Ghent was once extremely well fortified, and calcu|lated, by nature as well as by art, to repel encroach|ment. It had a very &s;trong ca&s;tle, walls, and ditches; and now, though not otherwi&s;e &s;trong, the country may, by &s;hutting up the fluices, be, for above a mile round, laid in a very &s;hort time under water. It was formerly &s;o populous and powerful, that it declared war more than once again&s;t its &s;overeign, and rai&s;ed amazing armies. In the year 1587, it &s;uffered dread|fully from all the ravages of famine, under which a number not le&s;s than three thou&s;and of its inhabi|tants peri&s;hed in one week.</P>
<P>This town is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the nativity of two celebrated characters: one was the famous JOHN of Gaunt, &s;on of King EDWARD the third of England; the other, the Emperor CHARLES the Fifth, who was born there in the year 1500.</P>
<P>It was in this city that the Confederation of the States, well known under the title of the Pacification of Ghent, which united the Provinces in the mo&s;t la&s;ting union of intere&s;t and laws, was held: this union was chiefly owing to the vigorous, unremitted efforts of WILLIAM the Fir&s;t, Prince of Orange, to who&s;e valour and virtue may be attributed the inde|pendence of the United States.</P>
<P>In this city there were computed to be fifty com|panies of trade&s;men, among whom were manufactured a variety of very curious and rich cloths, &s;tuffs, and &s;ilks: it is certain, that the woollen manufacture flou|ri&s;hed
<PB N="54" REF="031911_0050_0FEF494130063080">
here before it had made the &s;malle&s;t progre&s;s in England, who&s;e wool they then bought. There was al&s;o a good branch of linen manufacture here, and a pretty bri&s;k corn trade, for which it was locally well calculated. You will ob&s;erve, once for all, that in &s;peaking of this country, I generally u&s;e the pa&s;t ten&s;e; for, at pre&s;ent, they are utterly undone.</P>
<P>Ghent was the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who, like the bi&s;hop of Bruges, was &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Mech|lin. Thus, in mo&s;t Chri&s;tian countries, are the in|tellects, the con&s;ciences, and the ca&s;h too, of the peo|ple, &s;hut up and hid from the light, by prie&s;t within dean, and dean within bi&s;hop&mdash;like a ring in the hand of a conjurer, box within box&mdash;till at la&s;t they are enveloped in the great receptacle of all deception, the capacious pocket of the archbi&s;hop. Let not &s;ceptered tyrants, their legions, their &s;caffolds, and their &s;words, bear all the infamy of the &s;lavery of mankind! Opinion, opinion, under the management of fraud and impo&s;ture, is the engine that forges their fetters!!&mdash;JANSENIUS, from whom the Jan&s;eni&s;ts took their name, was the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of this place; and the late bi&s;hop, I think, may be reckoned the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The municipal government of this city is correct, and well calculated to &s;ecure internal peace and order. The chief magi&s;trate is the high bailiff; &s;ubordinate to whom are burgoma&s;ters, echivins, and coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>Ghent is not deficient in &s;tately edifices; and, true to their &s;y&s;tem, the holy fathers of the church have their &s;hare, which, in old Popi&s;h countries, is at lea&s;t nineteen twentieths. In the middle of the town is a high tower, called Belfort tower; from whence there is a delightful pro&s;pect over the whole city and its environs. Mona&s;teries and churches, there, are with|out number; be&s;ides ho&s;pitals and market-places: that called Friday's market, is the large&s;t of all, and
<PB N="55" REF="031911_0051_0FEF49459EBDC040">
is adorned with a &s;tatue of CHARLES the Fifth, in his imperial robes. The &s;tadthou&s;e is a magnificent &s;tructure&mdash;So is the cathedral, under which the reve|rend fathers have built a &s;ubterraneous church. What deeds are tho&s;e which &s;hun the light! Why tho&s;e holy patriarchs have &s;uch a de&s;ire for burying them&s;elves, and working like moles under ground, they them&s;elves be&s;t know, and I think it is not diffi|cult for others to conjecture.</P>
<P>This cathedral, however, is well worth attention, on account of &s;ome capital pictures it contains. The marble of the church is remarkably fine, and the altar-piece &s;plendid beyond all po&s;&s;ible de&s;cription; and, indeed, in all the others, there are paintings, eminent for their own excellence, and for the celebrity of the ma&s;ters who painted them.</P>
<P>In the mona&s;tery of St. PIERRE, there is a grand library, filled with books in all languages; but it is chiefly remarkable for the &s;uperlative beauty of its ceiling, one half of which was painted by RUBENS.</P>
<P>Thus you may perceive, my dear FREDERICK, the charity of the clergy!&mdash;how, in pure pity for the &s;ins of mankind, and in paternal care of their &s;ouls, they exact from the laity &s;ome atonement for their crimes, and con&s;train them at lea&s;t to repent&mdash;and, with un|paralleled magnanimity, take upon them&s;elves the vices, the gluttony, the avarice, and the &s;en&s;uality, of which they are &s;o careful to purge their fellow-crea|tures.</P>

<P>HAVING given you a general outline of the city of Ghent, I &s;hall now proceed to give you an account of one of the mo&s;t excellent, and certainly the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, of all the curio&s;ities in that place. It is indeed of a &s;ort &s;o immediately corre&s;pondent to the mo&s;t exalted &s;en&s;ations of humanity, and &s;o per|fectly in uni&s;on with the mo&s;t exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible chords of the feeling heart, that I re&s;olved to re&s;cue it from the common lumber of the place, and give it to you in a fre&s;h letter, when the ideas excited by my former might have faded away, and left your mind more clear for the reception of &s;uch refined impre&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>On one of the many bridges in Ghent &s;tand two large brazen images of a father and &s;on, who obtained this di&s;tingui&s;hed mark of the admiration of their fel|low-citizens by the following incidents:</P>
<P>Both the father and the &s;on were, for &s;ome offence again&s;t the &s;tate, condemned to die. Some favour|able circum&s;tances appearing on the &s;ide of the &s;on, he was granted a remi&s;&s;ion of his &s;hare of the &s;en|tence, upon certain provi&s;ions&mdash;in &s;hort, he was of|fered a pardon, on the mo&s;t cruel and barbarous con|dition that ever entered into the mind of even monk|i&s;h barbarity, namely, that he would become the ex|ecutioner of his father! He at fir&s;t re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to pre&s;erve his life by means &s;o fatal and dete&s;table: This is not to be wondered at; for I hope, for the
<PB N="57" REF="031911_0053_0FEF4948CE3C9B88">
honour of our nature, that there are but few, very few &s;ons, who would not have &s;purned, with abhor|rence, life &s;u&s;tained on conditions &s;o horrid, &s;o unna|tural. The &s;on, though long inflexible, was at length overcome by the tears and entreaties of a fond father, who repre&s;ented to him, that, at all events, his (the father's) life was forfeited, and that it would be the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible con&s;olation to him, at his la&s;t mo|ments, to think, that in his death he was the in&s;tru|ment of his &s;on's pre&s;ervation. The youth con&s;ented to adopt the horrible means of recovering his life and liberty: he lifted the axe; but, as it was about to fall, his arm &s;unk nervele&s;s, and the axe dropped from his hand! Had he as many lives as hairs, he would have yielded them all, one after the other, ra|ther than again even conceive, much le&s;s perpetrate, &s;uch an act. Life, liberty, every thing, vani&s;hed be|fore the dearer intere&s;ts of filial affection: he fell upon his father's neck, and, embracing him, triumphantly exclaimed, "My father, my father! we will die to|gether!" and then called for another executioner to fulfil the &s;entence of the law.</P>
<P>Hard mu&s;t be their hearts indeed, bereft of every &s;entiment of virtue, every &s;en&s;ation of humanity, who could &s;tand in&s;en&s;ible &s;pectators of &s;uch a &s;cene&mdash;A &s;udden peal of involuntary applau&s;es, mixed with groans and &s;ighs, rent the air. The execution was &s;u&s;pended; and on a &s;imple repre&s;entation of the tran&s;action, both were pardoned: high rewards and honours were conferred on the &s;on; and finally, tho&s;e two admirable brazen images were rai&s;ed, to comme|morate a tran&s;action &s;o honourable to human nature, and tran&s;mit it for the in&s;truction and emulation of po&s;terity. The &s;tatue repre&s;ents the &s;on in the very act of letting fall the axe.</P>
<P>Lay this to your mind, my dear FREDERICK: talk over it to your brother; indulge all the charming
<PB N="58" REF="031911_0054_0FEF494E08E76758">
&s;ympathetic &s;en&s;ations it communicates: never let a mi&s;taken &s;hame, or a fal&s;e idea (which &s;ome endea|vour to impre&s;s) that it is unmanly to melt at the tale of woe, and &s;ympathize with our fellow-creatures, &s;top the current of your &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;no! Be a&s;&s;ured, that, on the contrary, it is the true criterion of man|hood and valour to feel; and that the more &s;ympa|thetic and &s;en&s;ible the heart is, the more nearly it is allied to the Divinity.</P>
<P>I AM now on the point of conducting you out of Au&s;trian Flanders&mdash;One town only, and that compa|ratively a &s;mall one, lying between Us and Brabant: the name of this town is Alo&s;t, or, as the Flemings &s;pell it, Ael&s;t.</P>
<P>From Ghent to Bru&s;&s;els (the next great &s;tage in my way), I found, to my regret, that there was no conveyance by water: I therefore was obliged to go in a voiture, and &s;topt at Alo&s;t, as an intermediate &s;tage; and mathematically intermediate it is&mdash;for it lies at equal di&s;tance from Ghent and Bru&s;&s;els, being exactly fifteen miles from each.</P>
<P>This is a &s;mall, but exceeding neat town, &s;ituated on the river Dender; and being a remarkably great thoroughfare, accommodations of every kind are tole|rably good in it. It would be idle to &s;uppo&s;e, that Catholic zeal had left &s;o many &s;ouls unprotected and undi&s;ciplined, where there were &s;o many bodies ca|pable of drudgery to pay for it. In truth, there has been as ample provi&s;ion made for the town of Alo&s;t in the way of &s;acerdotal bu&s;ine&s;s, as for any other town in the Netherlands&mdash;regard being had to its bulk; for there were &s;everal convents of friars, and of cour&s;e &s;everal of nuns: be&s;ides, there was a Je&s;uit's college of &s;ome note. How they all fare by this time, it is difficult for me to determine.</P>

<P>In a convent inhabited by a &s;et of monks, deno|minated Gulielmite, I &s;aw the tomb of THIERRY MARTIN, who fir&s;t brought the art of printing from Germany to that place. His name and fame are tran&s;mitted to us by an epitaph upon his tomb, writ|ten by his friend, the ingenious Era&s;mus.</P>
<P>This tomb of THIERRY MARTIN &s;tands a monu|ment, not only of his merit, but of the &s;hort-fighted|ne&s;s and folly even of monks. Alas, &s;illy men! they little knew, that when they granted THIERRY MAR|TIN the honours of the convent, they were harbour|ing, in their hallowed ground, one of their greate&s;t enemies, and commemorating the man who was con|tributing to the overthrow of their &s;acred order: for the art of printing, wherever it reached, illuminated the human mind, and fir&s;t kindled up that light, be|fore which prie&s;tcraft, and all its pious impo&s;tures, like evil &s;pectres, have vani&s;hed. To the art of print|ing is human &s;ociety indebted for many of the advan|tages which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es beyond the brute or &s;avage tribes&mdash;for the perfection of arts, the exten&s;ion of &s;ci|ence, the general enlargement of the mind, and, above all, for the emancipation of per&s;on and property from the &s;hackles of de&s;poti&s;m, and of the human intellect from the fetters of blindne&s;s and ignorance with which &s;acerdotal fraud had chained it for centuries to the earth.</P>
<P>The territory of this city is of pretty large extent, and is called a county, having, in ancient times, had counts of its own; and the whole of it is extremely fruitful in pa&s;ture, corn, hops, flax, and mo&s;t other productions of tho&s;e climes.</P>
<P>I made but a very &s;hort &s;tay at Alo&s;t, when I pro|ceeded on to Bru&s;&s;els; and, having thus brought you

through that part of the Netherlands called Au&s;trian Flanders, I think I ought to give you a general ac|count of the country at large, as I have hitherto con|fined my&s;elf merely to the cities and towns of it; but as this letter is already of a length that will not allow of any great addition, I &s;hall po&s;tpone my intended de&s;cription to my next.</P>

<P>WERE mankind to be guided by modera|tion, rea&s;on, and ju&s;tice&mdash;were there no lu&s;t for terri|tory in particular &s;tates&mdash;no ambition or de&s;ire in kings for an undue enlargement of their power&mdash;no unju&s;tifiable infractions attempted by one &s;tate or po|tentate upon the peace and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another&mdash;no armies to carry de&s;olation and plunder through the world, nor churchmen more mild, but not more mo|derate, to drain them with their &s;ubtle deceptions&mdash; were the hu&s;bandman, the fi&s;herman, the manufactu|rer, and the labourer, permitted to make, by their in|du&s;try, the be&s;t u&s;e of the &s;oil on which chance or nature had planted them, and to lift the fruits of their labour to their own lips&mdash;no people were more happy than the inhabitants of Au&s;trian Flanders.</P>
<P>This country is bounded, to the north, by the Scheldt; to the north-we&s;t, by the Northern Sea; to the &s;outh, and &s;outh-we&s;t, by Artois, one of the fine&s;t Provinces of France; and to the ea&s;t, by Bra|bant. Its greate&s;t length is &s;eventy-five miles; and
<PB N="61" REF="031911_0057_0FEF4954EC80CE98">
its greate&s;t breadth, fifty-five. The air is good; but it is &s;aid to be better in proportion as it recedes from the &s;ea. The winters are &s;ometimes long and &s;evere, and the &s;ummers &s;ometimes wet and &s;ultry; yet, in general, the climate is agreeable. The &s;oil is in mo&s;t parts fertile, and in &s;ome to a degree equal to that of any part of Europe. It is chiefly famous for its pa&s;turage; in con&s;equence of which, great numbers of black cattle, hor&s;es and &s;heep, are bred in it, and immen&s;e quantities of butter and chee&s;e made. It is, be&s;ides, abundantly productive of all &s;orts of culinary vegetables&mdash;fruit in great quantities&mdash; corn and flax, which la&s;t is not only rai&s;ed in great plenty, but is celebrated for the finene&s;s and &s;trength of its &s;taple. It is true, that in &s;ome parts they have not corn &s;ufficient for the inhabitants; but this is well recompen&s;ed by other productions, with the redundance of which they purcha&s;e the &s;uperfluous grain of their neighbours&mdash;for, where the inhabitants do follow tillage, the produce is unequalled, and the &s;uperfluity mu&s;t of cour&s;e be great.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior fecundity of the &s;heep of this country is very remarkable, and difficult, perhaps, to be ac|counted for&mdash;a ewe here bringing forth con&s;tantly three lambs at a birth, &s;ometimes four, &s;ometimes five, and &s;ome have been known to produce as many as &s;ix and &s;even&mdash;no &s;mall in&s;tance of the prodigality of nature in providing for this &s;pot.</P>
<P>At &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea-coa&s;t, the face of the country is decorated with a profu&s;ion of wood, fitted either for timber or for fuel; and towards the coa&s;t, where nature has been rather niggard of that ble&s;&s;ing, the inhabitants &s;ub&s;titute, in its &s;tead, for fuel, a kind of turf, which they find at the depth of four of five feet from the &s;urface of the earth, and which makes a fire, not only cheerful, plea&s;ant, and hot, but remarkably whole&s;ome, being free from the de&s;|tructive
<PB N="62" REF="031911_0058_0FEF495938B9AAE0">
&s;ulphureous and bituminous vapour attendant upon coal.</P>
<P>Perhaps no part of the world is better &s;upplied than this province with all &s;orts of fi&s;h, as well tho&s;e of &s;ea as fre&s;h water: fowl and veni&s;on were extremely plenty and rea&s;onable; and a great deal of excellent beer was brewed in it. It is wa&s;hed by &s;everal rivers, four of which are noble &s;treams, namely, the Scheldt, the Lys, the Scarpe, and the Dender; and there are &s;everal canals, the chief of which is that between Bruges and Ghent.</P>
<P>Thus in whatever way it be con&s;idered, nature &s;eems to have made ample provi&s;ion for the happine&s;s of the people: how far they are &s;o, you &s;hall hear when I come to give a general view of the Nether|lands&mdash;that which is applicable to Au&s;trian Flanders being equally &s;o to all the other parts of the Nether|lands, excepting tho&s;e under the dominion of the Republic of the United States.</P>
<P>The States of this country, according to the con|&s;titution it once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ted of clergy, the no|bility, and the commoners. The clergy were the bi&s;hops and abbots: the nobility was compo&s;ed of certain families holding hereditary offices or baronies, to which that privilege was annexed; and the com|moners were made up of the burgoma&s;ters, pen&s;ioners and deputies of the cities and di&s;tricts. But the only religion profe&s;&s;ed or tolerated in this country, was the Roman Catholic.</P>
<P>Of the people of Au&s;trian Flanders a celebrated Author gives the following account, which I tran&s;|cribe for your u&s;e, the rather as my &s;tay there was too &s;hort to enable me to make any material ob&s;er|vations on them, or their manners.&mdash;</P>
<P>"With re&s;pect to the per&s;ons and characters of the inhabitants," &s;ays he, "they are, generally &s;peak|ing, lu&s;ty, fat, and clum&s;y&mdash;very indu&s;trious, both in
<PB N="63" REF="031911_0059_0FEF495C5DF868B8">
cultivating their lands, and in their trades and manu|factures&mdash;lovers of liberty, and enemies to &s;lavery&mdash; and not defective in good &s;en&s;e or judgment, though they have not &s;o lively an imagination as &s;ome other nations. Their women are fair, hand&s;ome enough, and hone&s;t by their natural con&s;titution, as well as from a principle of virtue: as they cannot pretend to wit and repartee, they do not make them&s;elves ridiculous by the nau&s;eous affectation of them. Both &s;exes are great lovers of public diver&s;ions; and every city, town, and village, have their kermi&s;&s;es, or fairs, in which all &s;orts of &s;hews are exhibited."</P>
<P>Many arts which now enrich other nations, and the importance of which has excited conte&s;ts and &s;truggles of the mo&s;t &s;erious kind in the political world, were invented or improved in that country. Weaving, in general, though not invented, was greatly improved; and the art of forming figures of all &s;orts in linen was fir&s;t invented there. To the Flemings we are al&s;o indebted for the arts of curing herrings, dyeing cloths and &s;tuffs, and oil-colours. But tho&s;e arts, and the manufactures, have gradually &s;lid away from them, and left but a &s;mall &s;hare be|hind, when compared with their former flouri&s;hing &s;tate: they have flown to a land of liberty and &s;ecurity, where ho&s;tile feet never tread, were &s;lavery corrupteth not, where war devoureth not, nor Prie&s;ts nor De&s;pots break in and &s;teal. Neverthele&s;s, &s;ilk, cotton and woollen &s;tuffs, brocades, camblets, tape&s;try, linen, and lace, are &s;till manufactured here to &s;ome &s;mall extent.</P>
<P>This province had counts of its own, from the ninth century up to the year 1369, when it was made over, by marriage (like a farm of cattle) to the dukes of Burgundy; and afterwards, again, was by them made over, in like way of marriage, to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. In 1667 Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;eized the &s;outhern

part; and the States General obtained the northern, partly by the treaty of Mun&s;ter, and partly by the Barrier treaty of 1715.</P>
<P>To reckon upon the natural endowments of this country, one would &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;hould be a ter|re&s;trial paradi&s;e: yet &s;uch is the wickedne&s;s of man, and the outrageous &s;pirit of power, that it is almo&s;t the la&s;t country in Europe in which I would have pro|perty, and fix a permanent re&s;idence. Ju&s;t now, while I am writing, I have before me an account, that the French to whom they opened their gates, have plun|dered them to the la&s;t atom of their moveable po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions; and that the property of the unfortunate people is now in waggons, on its way to Paris.</P>
<P>Once more, my boy, I &s;ay, ble&s;s your GOD, that planted you in a country cheered by the voice of freedom, defended by Briti&s;h valour, and, what is of more con&s;equence, &s;urrounded by the Ocean.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING conducted you through that part of the Netherlands called Au&s;trian Flanders, we are now to direct our attention to that called Au&s;trian Brabant, of which part, as well as of the Nether|lands in general, Bru&s;&s;els, where I arrived the &s;ame day I left Ghent, is the capital, giving its name to a quarter or territory that &s;urrounds it.</P>
<P>In all parts of the Netherlands through which I travelled&punc; I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> help admiring the uniform de|corations
<PB N="65" REF="031911_0061_0FEF495F9CCD0048">
of the roads, rivers, and canals, with rows of lofty trees, which form a mo&s;t agreeable &s;hade from the &s;ummer's burning &s;un, and yet do not ob|&s;truct any great extent of pro&s;pect, the country is &s;o extremely flat. And one thing I remarked, and which certainly &s;eems at fir&s;t view, extraordinary, is, that in the great extent of country through which we have hitherto pa&s;&s;ed, from O&s;tend to Bru&s;&s;els, being &s;ixty-eight miles, I &s;carce &s;aw one nobleman or gentleman's &s;eat&mdash;nothing above the hou&s;e of a hu&s;bandman, a curate, or &s;ome per&s;on of &s;mall for|tune: and yet the country is extremely rich; and I &s;aw many &s;pots, as I went along, charming be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd de&s;cription, and &s;uch as would tempt, I &s;hould think, a man of ta&s;te and opulence to &s;ettle in them. This mu&s;t appear unaccountable to tho&s;e who do not re|collect, that in a country &s;ubject like this to the ravaging incur&s;ions of contending armies, fortified towns are con&s;idered as the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, becau&s;e the mo&s;t &s;ecure retreats of opulence.</P>
<P>As I approached the city of Bru&s;&s;els, I was &s;truck with a mixed &s;en&s;ation of &s;urpri&s;e and delight at the appearance it made&mdash;none that I had ever &s;een being comparable to it, and not one in Europe, by the account of travellers, being in that re&s;pect &s;uperior to it, Naples and Genoa only excepted: like them, however, it, when entered, falls far &s;hort of the ex|pectation rai&s;ed by its external appearance, being all compo&s;ed of hills and hollows, which not only fatigue, but render the appearance of the &s;treets, though well built, contemptible and mean.</P>
<P>Bru&s;&s;els &s;tands on the beautiful little river Senne, on the brow of a hill. The city is about &s;even miles in circumference, has &s;even gates, with exten|&s;ive &s;uburbs, and is encompa&s;&s;ed with a double wall made of brick, and ditches; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> its &s;ize is too great for &s;trength, as a face of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;uch extent

could not po&s;&s;ibly hold out a long &s;iege&mdash;a great and in&s;uperable defect in &s;uch a country as I have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Great as is the extent of ground on which this city &s;tands, it is neverthele&s;s very well built, and extremely populous. It is ornamented with no fewer than &s;even &s;quares, all of them remarkably fine, par|ticularly the great &s;quare or market place, which is reckoned to be perhaps the fine&s;t in Europe. Around it are the halls of the different trades, the fronts of which are adorned, in a &s;uperb manner, with emble|matical &s;culpture, with gilding, and a variety of Latin in&s;criptions. One quarter of this &s;quare is entirely occupied by the town-hou&s;es, a noble pile of build|ing, in which there were apartments where the States of Brabant met, finely adorned with tape&s;try in gilt frames, and &s;ome admirable original paintings. At the time I was there, the whole city was in motion, preparing for the Inauguration of the EMPEROR, who was then impatiently expected, and who&s;e approach made &s;uch a bu&s;tle, and promi&s;ed &s;uch a &s;pectacle, as made me regret the nece&s;&s;ity I lay under of pro|ceeding on my journey. The town-hou&s;e was put into the highe&s;t order, and &s;ub&s;equently fell a &s;acri|fice to the great and important event for which it was prepared.</P>
<P>The &s;teeple of this building is of a mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous height&mdash;three hundred and &s;ixty-four feet; and on the top of it is erected a &s;tatue of Saint MICHAEL killing the Dragon, of the enormous height of &s;even|teen feet: this colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue is &s;o con&s;tructed as to &s;erve for a weather-cock; and being made of cop|per, well gilt, is at once con&s;picuous, magnificent, and ornamental.</P>
<P>The public buildings of Bru&s;&s;els, particularly the palaces and courts of the &s;everal princes, counts, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, (and, you may be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e,
<PB N="67" REF="031911_0063_0FEF4966ACE2C4B8">
the churches and cloi&s;ters too), are &s;pacious, ex|pen&s;ive, and magnificent. Behind the imperial palace, which &s;tood in the highe&s;t part of the city, but was burnt down many years ago, is a park, well &s;tocked with deer, and planted with trees, like St. James's-park at London, for the inhabitants to walk in. At the farther end of it is a fine plea&s;ure-hou&s;e, built by the Emperor CHARLES the fifth, after his abdication.</P>
<P>The palace is a magnificent &s;tructure: the rooms of it are fini&s;hed in a &s;tyle far &s;uperior to tho&s;e of any palace in England, and enriched with many fine paint|ings: that of the family of HECTOR, in the council chamber, lays claim to the fir&s;t. rank of eminence. Of the other buildings (the grandeur of which enti|tle them to the names of palaces), tho&s;e of the Prince de la Tour and Taxis, and the Briti&s;h earl of Ayle&s;|bury, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by great beauty and magnifi|cence. Indeed, in all the palaces, there are collec|tions of original paintings, by the mo&s;t eminent ma&s;|ters, both Italian and Flemi&s;h.</P>
<P>The royal library of Bru&s;&s;els claims particular at|tention, for the magnitude and liberality of its e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, containing a grand collection of the mo&s;t excellent books in ail languages, and being open all the year on Tue&s;days, Thur&s;days, and Saturdays, to public acce&s;s.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal of Bru&s;&s;els is extremely well worth going to &s;ee, on account of the very curious antique arms it contains&mdash;of which it is, at this di&s;tance of time, impo&s;&s;ible for me to give you any account worth attention. The armour of the Emperor CHARLES the Fifth, together with the furniture of his hor&s;e, and &s;tate &s;word, are &s;hewn: I could &s;ee nothing either novel or intere&s;ting in them&mdash;a &s;trong mark, I pre|&s;ume, of my want of ta&s;te; but I confe&s;s my organs are not &s;o refined as to feel any extraordinary emo|tions

at the &s;ight of a heap of inert matter, merely becau&s;e it once enveloped the carca&s;e of a tyrant: neither were they &s;o very coar&s;e or dull as not to un|dergo very pointed &s;en&s;ations at the &s;ight of the ar|mour of MONTEZUMA, the injured emperor of Mex|ico; the victim of avarice and rapine, under their u&s;ual ma&s;k, religion. Why MONTEZUMA's armour &s;hould make a part of the trophies of a Popi&s;h &s;tate, and be triumphantly exhibited, is hard to account for in human folly: why that &s;hould be exhibited which is a &s;tain of the deepe&s;t-damned black, in their black code of faith, is a&s;toni&s;hing, unle&s;s we allow the truth of the old &s;aying, "Quos DEUS vult perdere, prius dementat;" and that, after having violated every principle of virtue, morality, and human feeling&mdash; after having &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in cruelty all that we know of the wor&s;t mon&s;ters of the earth, or of the deep, the fell hyena, or the ravening &s;hark&mdash;after having &s;uc|ce&s;sfully emulated the wor&s;t efforts of the mo&s;t malig|nant &s;pirits that are &s;aid to hold coun&s;el for the ruin of mankind in hell&mdash;they were de&s;irous to tran&s;mit the &s;poils of their ravages to po&s;terity, to tell them what glorious things have been atchieved in days of yore, for the love of CHRIST&mdash;to demon&s;trate what benefits are to be derived from a religion which has, for &s;o many hundred years, given &s;anction to every enormity that &s;trikes the &s;oul of man with horror, and thereby to make converts to their principles. Mon|&s;ters! fools! Away with your idle cants, ye hypo|crites, who would brand the cruelties of the pre&s;ent days, the ma&s;&s;acres of the Jacobins, with the crime of infidelity, and attribute tho&s;e much lamented defec|tions from humanity to a falling off from the Chri&s;|tian faith. Look to Mexico!&mdash;&s;ee a mon&s;ter, a high prie&s;t of your religion, collecting, by fair promi&s;es and &s;weet per&s;ua&s;ion, a people round him; and, when a plain was filled, commanding his bloodhounds, arm|ed

with &s;word and crucifix, to fall upon and mur|der them&mdash;becau&s;e one poor creature, who knew not what a book meant, had accidentally dropped a bible from his hands!&mdash;&s;ee him not &s;paring age or &s;ex, but butchering all, for the love of CHRIST!&mdash; When have the deluded and enfrenzied mob of France perpetrated, in the full torrent of popular frenzy, &s;uch atrocities as this cruel prie&s;t committed in cold blood? when have they hunted down their fellow-creatures, ma&s;&s;acred children, and given their yet panting members to their dogs for food, as pious Chri&s;tians, headed by a pious prie&s;t, have done in Mexico? Never! never!&mdash;Learn wi&s;dom, then, ye hypocrites! and if you cannot convince your enemies by rea&s;on, or conquer them by force, and if their pre|datory and wicked progre&s;s is not to be &s;topped, do not &s;anctify their enormities, or palliate their crimes, in the eye of rea&s;on, by a compari&s;on with tho&s;e of a deeper dye: remember, that "not to be the wor&s;t &s;tands in &s;ome rank of prai&s;e," and that the Jacobin cruelties of Paris, horrible though they were, were pity and tender mercy, compared with the Chri&s;tian butchery in Mexico, in Europe, in A&s;ia, in every place where Popery ever &s;et its bloody hoof.</P>
<P>You are not, from what I &s;ay, to infer that I enter|tain any illiberal animo&s;ity to Popery, as many men, and more women, do, merely becau&s;e its articles of faith differ from tho&s;e in which I was bred; I tru&s;t my heart and under&s;tanding are above &s;uch very de|grading prejudices: but I abhor every thing that mi|litates again&s;t human happine&s;s&mdash;every thing that cru&s;hes the operations of intellect&mdash;every thing that &s;tops the current of opinion, and prevents its cour&s;e from enlarging and meliorating our condition: I ab|hor the impertinent and hypocritical intru&s;ion of all churchmen upon national or dome&s;tic concerns; the more, when that intru&s;ion is mi&s;chievous; and more

&s;till, when it a&s;&s;umes the ma&s;k of piety&mdash;for that is at once a fraud upon man and an abu&s;e of GOD. All tho&s;e cau&s;es of abhorrence attach, more or le&s;s, to all &s;ects of the Chri&s;tian religion, the Quakers only excepted&mdash;but to Popery rather more than to any of the others; for it is ob&s;erved, that while the very fir&s;t principles of Chri&s;tianity, as originally laid down in theory, are peace and good-will towards men, warfare, per&s;ecution, and blood&s;hed, have prac|tically marked its foot&s;teps wherever it has trod, and its very e&s;&s;ence been perverted by its own mini&s;ters, who, entru&s;ted with the key of the temple, &s;teal the ve&s;tments from the altar, to cover the deformed, crooked back of vice. But the rays of dawning rea|&s;on now break with fuller light upon mankind; and it ha&s;tens to meridian re&s;plendence, before which tho&s;e phantoms rai&s;ed by pious jugglers will vani&s;h, and, "like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, leave not a wreck behind."</P>

<P>IN the ar&s;enal of Bru&s;&s;els was another curio|&s;ity, which I overlooked in my la&s;t&mdash;a model of a cannon, con&s;tructed &s;o as to throw &s;even balls at once. It is &s;ome con&s;olation to philanthropy to reflect, that of all the abominable engines and in&s;truments which the inventive faculties of man have di&s;covered to in|crea&s;e the cruelty and carnage of war, not one has been of late times adopted. This model lies here, therefore, only as a memorial of the diabolical genius of the inventor.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="031911_0067_0FEF497129645040">The opera-hou&s;e of Bru&s;&s;els, accounted the noble&s;t and large&s;t in Europe, is built after the Italian man|ner, with rows of lodges or clo&s;ets, in mo&s;t of which are chimneys. One of tho&s;e, which belonged to a prince, who&s;e title I now forget, was hung with look|ing-gla&s;&s;es, in which, while he &s;at by the fire, took refre&s;hments, or reclined on his couch, he could &s;ee the whole repre&s;entation, without being expo&s;ed to the view of either the actors or the audience.</P>
<P>The markets of Bru&s;&s;els are very remarkable. The dukes of St. Pierre paid no le&s;s than forty thou&s;and florins, or upwards of three thou&s;and pounds Sterling, for four pictures of them, painted by RUBENS and SYNDER&mdash;LEWIS the Fourteenth of France offered an immen&s;e &s;um of money for them; but they found their way at la&s;t into the collection of the Briti&s;h Earl of Orford. The value of them is &s;aid, by connoi&s;|&s;eurs, to be beyond computation.</P>
<P>Bru&s;&s;els is extremely well &s;upplied with water; for, be&s;ides the river, it has twenty public fountains, adorned with &s;tatues, at the corners of the mo&s;t pub|lic &s;treets; and the lower part of the city is cut into canals, which communicate with the great one, ex|tending from Bru&s;&s;els to the Scheldt, fifteen miles: by means of this canal, which was fini&s;hed in 1561, and co&s;t the city eight hundred thou&s;and florins, a per&s;on may &s;ail from Bru&s;&s;els to the North Sea; and barques do actually go twice a-day to Antwerp, and back again.</P>
<P>This city is full of churches, of which the mo&s;t remarkable is that of Saint MICHAEL and Saint GUDULA, commonly called the cathedral. It is a &s;uperb, old Gothic &s;tructure, and, from its celebrated &s;ituation, a mo&s;t beautiful ornament to the city. It is not only grand in its external appearance, but finely adorned within. The pillars which &s;upport the roof are lofty and elegant: and again&s;t each is a &s;ta|tue
<PB N="72" REF="031911_0068_0FEF4972C80FC820">
of ten feet in height. There are no le&s;s than &s;ix|teen chapels in it; and each chapel is enriched with abundance of &s;plendid ornaments, altar finery, candle|&s;ticks, crucifixes, &amp;c. and with &s;ome excellent pic|tures too: a picture of JESUS CHRIST pre&s;enting the keys of Paradi&s;e to Saint PETER, which is reckoned among the chef-d'oeuvres of RUBENS, hangs in one of tho&s;e chapels. There are &s;ome monuments, al&s;o, of very great merit, in the choir of this church. But that which I think by far the greate&s;t and mo&s;t admi|rable curio&s;ity (I mean of human workman&s;hip) in the church, is a pulpit&mdash;one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t exqui&s;itely wrought pieces I have ever &s;een: at the bottom are &s;een ADAM and EVE as large as life, re|pre&s;ented as at the moment when the angel drove them out of Paradi&s;e: in both of their faces are deeply and expre&s;&s;ively marked the traits of a mind agoni&s;ed with angui&s;h and remor&s;e: behind EVE is a figure of Death, which follows them; and on the top of the pulpit are &s;een the figures of JESUS CHRIST and the Virgin MARY cru&s;hing the head of the Ser|pent. The &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions in the faces of all tho&s;e figures, and the exqui&s;ite turn of the workman&s;hip, is the more remarkable, as it is all cut out of oak wood.</P>
<P>Of &s;upernatural curio&s;ities, one of the chapels in this cathedral contains &s;ome, that, for miracle, yield to none in the long catalogue of monki&s;h devices. Three ho&s;ts or wafers are daily wor&s;hipped by the people; which ho&s;ts or wafers, the prie&s;ts firmly a&s;|&s;ert, and the people as firmly believe, were, &s;o long ago as the year 1369, &s;tabbed by a Jew, and bled profu&s;ely. They are expo&s;ed on every fe&s;tival, in a chalice richly &s;et with diamonds; and on the fir&s;t Sun|day after every thirteenth of July, there is a yearly proce&s;&s;ion in memory of this &s;tabbing and bleeding, when the ho&s;ts are carried in great &s;tate round the city, embelli&s;hed with all manner of precious &s;tones,
<PB N="73" REF="031911_0069_0FEF4975985658C0">
and attended by all the clergy, &s;ecular and regular, the magi&s;trates, the courts of ju&s;tice, and even by the governor of the province: the chapel where they are kept is of marble, and the altar of &s;olid &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Great GOD! what an opprobrium to the human under&s;tanding, that, at the time when the mind of man is &s;ufficiently enlightened to avoid the weakne&s;s of &s;hameful credulity, a whole people &s;hould &s;toop to &s;uch extravagant impo&s;ition! what a &s;hame to ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty, that tho&s;e who are tru&s;ted to guard the rights of a people, and who certainly are too well informed to yield their belief to &s;uch tra&s;h, &s;hould yet join in, and give the weight of their authority to &s;o gro&s;s, &s;o wicked a deception on a community! The magi&s;trates, the courts of ju&s;tice, and the governor&mdash; they walk, too, in company with the bald-pated im|po&s;tors&mdash;Good GOD! can more be &s;aid? volumes of comment could not elucidate or render it more con|&s;picuou&s;ly ab&s;urd than the bare recital of the fact it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to recount to you the num|ber of nunneries, of various orders, in which unfor|tunate women were cloi&s;tered up, &s;ome from bigotry, and others by force, in this city. There were, how|ever, two of them Engli&s;h&mdash;one of Dominican ladies, founded by Cardinal HOWARD, in the reign of CHARLES the Second, of which a lady of the noble Hou&s;e of Norfolk was always abbe&s;s: the other is of Benedictine nuns; the Beguinage of the latter is like a little town, &s;urrounded with a wall and ditch, and divided into pretty little &s;treets, where every Beguine has her apartment; the number of them amounts in general to &s;even or eight hundred, &s;ometimes more.</P>
<P>If population be the true &s;trength of a nation, this part, of Popery is very impolitic. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of women in this one convent &s;ince the reign of CHARLES the &s;econd, mu&s;t amount to many thou&s;ands. Had tho&s;e been married, and, on an average, had only
<PB N="74" REF="031911_0070_0FEF49796E7C40D8">
two children each, with the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, down to the pre&s;ent day, in all the ramifications of de&s;cent, there is no doubt but their number would equal that of the whole people of &s;ome exten&s;ive provinces. What, then, mu&s;t be the lo&s;s to the population of the earth, ari&s;ing from the celibacy of &s;o many millions of males and females as have been con&s;igned to &s;terility in the catholic countries, ever &s;ince that extraor|dinary doctrine came fir&s;t into fa&s;hion? It is out of the reach of calculation: not but, now and then, they may have children&mdash;indeed they certainly have; but tho&s;e are generally di&s;po&s;ed of in a way not to bring &s;hame on the frail Si&s;terhood, or their Con|fe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>In wading through &s;uch a torrent of offen&s;ive ideas as the innumerable ab&s;urdities and deceptions of Popi&s;h countries continually rai&s;e in the mind, it is a plea&s;ing circum&s;tance to be relieved by the con|templation of &s;ome really u&s;eful, humane in&s;titution; and &s;uch a one pre&s;ents it&s;elf now to my recollection: At Bru&s;&s;els, and, I am told, at all great towns of the Netherlands, there is a public office for lending money at a very moderate intere&s;t upon pledges: it is called the Mount of Piety; and was e&s;tabli&s;hed nearly 108 years ago by the Archduke, ALBERT, and ISABELLA, his wife. By this in&s;titution, the poor are &s;aved from the fleecings and frauds of pawn-brokers: and to render it &s;till more perfect in ac|commodation, there are private pa&s;&s;ages for en|trance; &s;o that tho&s;e who would wi&s;h to conceal their nece&s;&s;ities, are exempted from the mortification of being &s;een publicly going in, or coming out.</P>
<P>You have read, I pre&s;ume, that in the days of Heatheni&s;m, the Deities of that curious Mythology were &s;uppo&s;ed to rejoice in the number Three. The Popi&s;h Code has fixed upon Seven as the lucky num|ber.
<PB N="75" REF="031911_0071_0FEF497C76528E20">
Thus they have &s;even &s;acraments, &s;even deadly &s;ins, &amp;c. &amp;c. Bru&s;&s;els has improved upon that; and, taking the hint from their ble&s;&s;ed liturgy, has &s;even grand &s;treets; &s;even pari&s;h-churches; &s;even Patrician families, out of which the Magi&s;trates are or were elected; &s;even large &s;quares; &s;even midwives, licen&s;ed and &s;worn by the Senate; and &s;even gates, lead|ing to &s;even places of recreations and exerci&s;e, one to a place proper for fowling, a &s;econd to a place for fi&s;hing, a third to one for hunting, a fourth to plea&s;ant fields, a fifth to pa&s;time grounds, a &s;ixth to &s;prings and vineyards, and a &s;eventh to gardens. Be&s;ides all which &s;evens, they boa&s;t of having once had the great good fortune of entertaining, at one time, &s;even crowned heads, with &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e belonging to their retinue. If there were any &s;pell in the num|ber Seven, the people of Bru&s;&s;els &s;urely mu&s;t have been &s;ecure from all mi&s;chief; but the <HI>Sans-culottes</HI> have broken the charm, di&s;per&s;ed the necromancers, and lowered poor number Seven to its mere arith|metical value.</P>
<P>The inns, or eating hou&s;es, in this city, were equal to any in the world: a &s;tranger might dine there better and cheaper than in any place per|haps, on earth. The wines, al&s;o, were excellent and cheap; and coach-hire beyond expectation rea|&s;onable&mdash;And here I recollect to remark to you, that, all the way from O&s;tend to Bru&s;&s;els, one is obliged to &s;it, dine, &amp;c. in bed-chambers; a circum|&s;tance which is extremely di&s;cordant to the feelings of tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to Briti&s;h inns, although the bed-chambers are, to &s;ay the truth, large and commodious. At the very walls of Bru&s;&s;els begins the famous wood of Sogne, from which the inhabitants were allowed to cut wood for fuel: as fa&s;t as the trees were cut down, fre&s;h ones were planted in their
<PB N="76" REF="031911_0072_0FEF497E09358B40">
&s;tead; by which means the wood was pre&s;erved, and it afforded a continual &s;upply to the poor.</P>
<P>Bru&s;&s;els is &s;o very remarkable, a place that I have taken more than my u&s;ual &s;cope of de&s;cription of it. Ju&s;t as I had fini&s;hed it, I read a paragraph in the public papers, &s;tating that it is likely to be annexed to the territories of the French Republic.</P>

<P>HITHERTO, as I have proceeded on my travels, I have been purpo&s;ely very particular in my de&s;criptions of the towns through which I pa&s;&s;ed on my way to India, in order to give your mind a di&s;|po&s;ition to inquiry, and point out to you an over|flowing &s;ource of improvement and delight. Having &s;o far &s;hewn you how amply you will be rewarded, even in amu&s;ement, by the trouble of &s;earching into books, for the accurate topographical de&s;crip|tions of towns, cities, buildings, &amp;c. &amp;c. I think I may &s;pare my&s;elf that labour for the future, and confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e points that more immediately apply to the enlargement of the mind&mdash;I mean, the government, laws, manners, and character of the people of each country; and only u&s;e the former as &s;ub&s;er|vient to the latter purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t until I come to tho&s;e places where, the ground being but little trod|den by Briti&s;h feet, more preci&s;e de&s;cription may become nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="031911_0073_0FEF49815729B3E8">But, before I leave the Netherlands, I mu&s;t make a few remarks upon the country and people, which it would be unpardonable in me to omit, after having been already &s;o minutely particular in things of inferior merit to the &s;cope of my plan.</P>
<P>Although per&s;onal appearance be, in the eye of Moral Philo&s;ophy, a very inferior con&s;ideration, and mind the proper &s;tudy of man; yet, in de&s;cribing a people, I cannot think it altogether unnece&s;&s;ary to include their per&s;onal appearance, as it will be found that there exi&s;ts a greater analogy between the per&s;on and the mind of men than is generally per|ceived. Thus the lively hilarity, the re&s;tle&s;s activity, the levity and fanta&s;tic character of the French, are &s;trongly pourtrayed in the national per&s;on. In like manner, the lu&s;ty, fat, clum&s;y and mis&s;hapen per&s;on of the people of the Netherlands, is &s;trongly illu&s;|trative of the temper and habit of their mind, in|tellects and &s;pirits: indu&s;trious and heavy; dull of under&s;tanding, but not defective in judgment; &s;low in work&mdash;but, per&s;evering in effort, and unerring in the proce&s;s, they are generally &s;ucce&s;sful in the end: in war, cold and backward at offen&s;ive operations, but inflexible and terrible in re&s;i&s;tance; like the boar of the fore&s;t, they &s;eek not the combat with any, but will not go out of their way to decline it with the mo&s;t powerful: their appetites and de&s;ires cooler than other nations, but le&s;s &s;ubject to change or caprice: never violently in love, but rationally at|tached to their wives; and both men and women faithful to their conjugal vow, as well from natural temperament, as from a principle of virtue.</P>
<P>Thus con&s;tituted by nature, the effects of their in|du&s;try are wonderful in every thing, but chiefly in their canals and &s;luices, which &s;erve not only for the &s;upport of their commerce, and the facility of inter|cour&s;e, but for their defence again&s;t enemies: this

was in other times; but, alas! the former of the&s;e u&s;es, commerce, has &s;o entirely ab&s;orbed all their in|tellect, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their very &s;ouls, that they &s;eem almo&s;t entirely negligent of the latter; and from being, of all people, the mo&s;t wi&s;e and vigilant in determining and a&s;certaining their rights, the mo&s;t zealous a&s;&s;erters and defenders of their independence, the mo&s;t ardent friends to liberty, and the mo&s;t determined enemies to &s;lavery, they are become a &s;ort of &s;trange, in|con&s;i&s;tent, hotch-potch politicians, whom ingenuity it&s;elf would find a difficulty in de&s;cribing. They retain &s;o much of their ancient and noble vigilance as &s;erves to make them &s;u&s;picious&mdash;&s;o much of their indepen|dence as di&s;po&s;es them to change&mdash;&s;o much of their jealou&s;y as &s;timulates them to re&s;i&s;tance&mdash;but not one particle of their former wi&s;dom, to in&s;truct them where they &s;hould attach them&s;elves, where re&s;i&s;t, or where re&s;olve to act&mdash;nor of their courage to carry any re&s;olution they might form into effect.</P>
<P>In the year 1781, the Emperor JOSEPH the Second came to Bru&s;&s;els, in order to indulge his paternal feelings as a monarch with the contemplation and view of his &s;ubjects, and al&s;o to be inaugurated; and perhaps upon no occa&s;ion that has ever occurred in the mo&s;t volatile nation, was there greater joy more univer&s;ally expre&s;&s;ed. For &s;ome time before his arrival, the whole country was in motion; and, even with them, dome&s;tic indu&s;try &s;topped its u&s;ual per&s;evering pace, &s;u&s;pended in the eager, anxious expectation of his arrival. Every thing in the birth, education, natural di&s;po&s;ition and per&s;on of the young Emperor, united to impre&s;s his &s;ubjects with the mo&s;t exalted opinion of his goodne&s;s, and to in&s;pire all ranks of people with the mo&s;t fortunate pre&s;ages of a wi&s;e and beneficent government. Nor did he di&s;appoint them: his conduct, when among them, is handed over to remembrance, by a variety of acts of benevolence
<PB N="79" REF="031911_0075_0FEF49872CE57820">
and conde&s;cen&s;ion, which &s;howed that the grandeur of the monarch had not made him forget the nature of the man, and that his heart was better fitted for the mild, dome&s;tic enjoyments of a &s;ubject, than the &s;tern and unbending hardihood fit for a King: for I am perfectly of opinion with the celebrated JUNIUS, that there are virtues in a private man which are vices in a King; and that the monarch of a country, in order to pre&s;erve re&s;pect, &s;hould avoid familiarity, and keep his per&s;on &s;acred from too general ob&s;ervation.

<P>The affability of monarchs has often been magni|fied by the fooli&s;h, and often blamed by the wi&s;e: But, if all the in&s;tances of conde&s;cen&s;ion practi&s;ed by kings were like that I have recited of JOSEPH; if they aro&s;e from a &s;ound, unque&s;tionable &s;pirit of phi|lanthropy, not from gaping curio&s;ity, broad folly, or a puerile inqui&s;itive habit; and if, in&s;tead of conceiving tho&s;e they vi&s;it paid for their intru&s;ion with the honour of having conver&s;ed with maje&s;ty, and leaving them churli&s;hly, they would generou&s;ly pay them with hard ca&s;h, as the good Emperor JOSEPH did; then, indeed, their affability might defy the exaggeration of fools, and mu&s;t certainly command the applau&s;e of the wi&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July, the ceremony of inauguration took place at Bru&s;&s;els. Nothing could equal the &s;plendour of the place but the general joy of the peo|ple: the crowds were beyond all conception immen&s;e, and every thing was carried on with regularity till evening, when, in playing off &s;ome fire-works, that noble building the town-hou&s;e took fire, and was burnt: &s;ix unfortunate per&s;ons lo&s;t their lives, and twenty were dangerou&s;ly hurted: tho&s;e who peri&s;hed were ab&s;olutely roa&s;ted, and their cries were beyond

de&s;cription piercing. To &s;uch a temper as JOSEPH's, you will readily conclude that this mu&s;t be a mo&s;t afflicting circum&s;tance&mdash;it was &s;o; and he left Bru&s;|&s;els under the pre&s;&s;ure of very different feelings from tho&s;e with which he entered it, and was followed by the prayers and ble&s;&s;ings of all the people.</P>
<P>But now we are to view the rever&s;e of the medal. The &s;ound of their prayers for his welfare, and prai&s;es of his goodne&s;s, had hardly died away upon their lips, ere their minds turned to revolt and rebellion. I will not &s;ay that they were not right in one or other, or which of tho&s;e two extremes: certainly they could not be right in both; much le&s;s can their &s;ub|&s;equent conduct be ju&s;tified, or accounted for, in any principle of human nature, but that of the mo&s;t ab|ject meanne&s;s, da&s;tardly feeblene&s;s, and gro&s;s folly. They returned to their allegiance, and be&s;ought for|givene&s;s: that forgivene&s;s was granted. How they have behaved &s;ince, I have already informed you, (&s;ee Letter IV.); and I have now to add, that, pil|laged by the French, and likely to be left unprotect|ed, they have again held their necks out, &s;oliciting the protection and the yoke of Au&s;tria, and have actually offered to rai&s;e 100,000 men for the empe|ror, <HI>if</HI> he will again drive the French out of their territories&mdash;An excellent word that IF!</P>
<P>How a people, once formed for manly pith and love of freedom, could bend &s;o low, is unaccountable. It is a que&s;tion hard to be determined, whether an ob|&s;tinate adherence even to a bad cau&s;e, is not more re&s;pectable, than a fickle, alternate dereliction, and adoption of right and wrong, as it &s;uits the caprice or convenience of the moment? Of two things &s;o very contemptible, I think the former the lea&s;t odious and lea&s;t unmanly.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, my ob&s;ervations on the country led me to conceive, that under the name of freedom,

they groaned under the yoke of tyranny; for, though the country was, as I have de&s;cribed it, charming, its fecundity un&s;urpa&s;&s;ed, its face decorated with the be&s;t gifts of Providence&mdash;I mean, &s;miling fields and bleat|ing plains&mdash;though <HI>Ceres</HI> profu&s;ely repaid the labours of the hu&s;bandman, though every field had the ap|pearance of a garden, and though, upon inquiry, I found that land which would bring in England five pounds an acre, rented at eight, nine, and ten &s;hil|lings of our money at mo&s;t&mdash;yet, in &s;pite of all this, the farmers were rather poor in general&mdash;not even one of them to be found rich or &s;ub&s;tantial, like the middle rank of that cla&s;s of men in England. They wanted the great &s;timulus to indu&s;try&mdash;&s;ecurity of their property: they were liable to be turned out by their landlords at plea&s;ure, and to be plundered when it &s;hould plea&s;e &s;ome monarch to make war.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, however, you will ob&s;erve, is not the oppre&s;&s;ion of the emperor: it is the tyranny of that wor&s;t of all con&s;tituent parts of a &s;tate, an ari&s;tocracy&mdash;a vile ari&s;tocracy!&mdash;that univer&s;al, that every-day de&s;poti&s;m, under which all places groan, more or le&s;s&mdash;which is exerci&s;ed in all the various gradations of life that chequer &s;ociety, from the great man who, under the name of mini&s;ter, domineers over the peer, to the country fox-hunting &s;avage, who puts a poor wretch in jail to pine for years, (his family, the while, &s;upported by the pari&s;h charity), only for doing that which makes the enjoyment of his own life, killing a partridge or a hare!&mdash;that ari&s;tocratic tyranny which is &s;een &s;cowling on the brows of a &s;waggering fellow in power, adopted by his &s;ecretary with increa&s;e, by him handed down to an up&s;tart &s;et of fellows in office, dependent on his &s;mile, and by them di&s;played in all the nau&s;eous, de&s;picable forms which awkwardne&s;s and ignorance, lifted above their &s;tation, never fail to a&s;&s;ume&mdash;the cold re&s;erve, the af|fected

Why, our very women have their &s;aucy, ari&s;tocratic, &s;uper|cilious front, their haughty &s;tare, their contemptuous titter; and barter the winning &s;oftne&s;s of the &s;ex, the dimples where the loves &s;hould dwell, for the haughty to&s;s of the head, the ill-natured &s;neer, and the in&s;ult|ing Hector's frown&mdash;And thus the &s;pirit of ari&s;to|cracy, like a poi&s;onous weed, grows and expands from one to the other with baleful luxuriance, gradually over&s;preading the whole face of humanity, &s;topping the whole&s;ome current of the &s;ocial atmo&s;phere, and choaking up the le&s;s rank but more u&s;eful plants&mdash; Thus it goes round in &s;hameful traffic; and, as the poet &s;ays,

<P>AS the time of my departure from Bru&s;&s;els approached, I found the bitter &s;en&s;ations with which I left London, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, returning. My for|tunate encounter with General LOCKHART had af|forded me a temporary re&s;pite; but now I was once more to face an unknown country alone, without the chance of again meeting a friend to &s;olace my mind, or mitigate my woe, on this &s;ide of India.</P>

after pa&s;&s;ing through a beautiful, fertile, well-culti|vated country, to the charms of which the renewed agony of my feelings rendered me almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>As we have now almo&s;t the whole length of Ger|many before us to travel through, it will be proper, before I proceed further, to give you a general idea of the con&s;titution of this va&s;t empire&mdash;over all which, while one great monarch nominally pre&s;ides, there are &s;pread a number of petty potentates, who really rule after as di&s;tinct forms of government as almo&s;t any two governments, however remote in Europe.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the nature of government ab&s;tractedly, one would &s;uppo&s;e that it aro&s;e from the general will of the &s;ociety governed, and was formed for their u&s;e and benefit alone: but if we view the different &s;y&s;|tems &s;cattered over the civilized part of the earth, we &s;hall find that they originated from force and fraud; and that, in their fir&s;t formation, when bodily prowe&s;s, not intellectual power, bore &s;way&mdash;when he that could carry the &s;tronge&s;t armour, and &s;trike the hea|vie&s;t blows, was &s;ure to govern&mdash;when mere animal &s;trength and ferocity di&s;inherited rea&s;on of her rights, and robbed her of that a&s;cendency to which the in|vention of gunpowder, aided by the art of printing, has &s;ince in &s;ome &s;ort re&s;tored her&mdash;the ba&s;is upon which governments were rai&s;ed was, one man, not the whole &s;ociety; the point then was, how this or that &s;trong ruffian could collect mo&s;t &s;laves about him, not how this or that &s;ociety &s;hould choo&s;e the be&s;t head: if he had &s;trength to carry havoc through the ranks of their enemies, and then to overawe them&s;elves, he was &s;ure of dominion over the people, and left it to his &s;on; but if it &s;o happened that he did not al&s;o bequeath to him bodily prowe&s;s to pre&s;erve it, the next &s;trong ruffian &s;eized the reins, flung him from his &s;eat, and kept it till he, or &s;ome one of his heirs, was again &s;erved &s;o in his turn by &s;ome other u&s;ur|per.
<PB N="86" REF="031911_0082_0FEF499B717AEE60">
Hence aro&s;e the cabals and intrigues of courts, the &s;pirit of party, and inte&s;tine commotion; till at length the people, for their own &s;ecurity, and to avoid the horrors of civil war, made choice (from di&s;mal nece&s;&s;ity) of &s;ome one family to rule them. As &s;ociety advanced, and opulence held forth temp|tation, &s;ome greater ruffian, followed by a horde of needy, fami&s;hed barbarians, made incur&s;ions on tho&s;e rulers; and being irre&s;i&s;tible, as well from numbers firmly connected, as from the powerful impul&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, under who&s;e banners they generally robbed and ravaged, was &s;ubmitted to on terms, and became Lord Paramount of a number of petty &s;overeigns, who did homage to him, and fleeced the mi&s;erable &s;ubjects, to keep him in humour; and thus, in a &s;eries of time, the power of both took root, and remained immoveable, unle&s;s when torn up by &s;ome violent tempe&s;t that convul&s;ed the &s;tate, and &s;hook it to its foundations.</P>
<P>Reading this account, you will very naturally ex|claim, "Good GOD! how ab&s;urd! how irrational!" Yet &s;o it is; and from this &s;ource, muddy though it be, is modern honour, and modern greatne&s;s, and mo|dern high blood, derived: from this foul and turbid fountain have mo&s;t of the governments of the world i&s;&s;ued; from tho&s;e &s;trong men of yore have mo&s;t of our modern governors de&s;cended: and as it generally happens (&s;o equally has Providence di&s;tributed the gifts of nature) that the &s;trength of the intellectual part is in the inver&s;e ratio of the animal, perhaps that is the rea&s;on why monarchs are formed, in general, of greater bodily vigour than mental endowments, and better fitted for the field than the cabinet&mdash;and for this rea&s;on are obliged to take from the pui&s;ne ranks of their &s;ubjects &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tant, &s;o far removed from the great &s;tandard of antique dignity, as to po&s;|&s;e&s;s under&s;tanding enough to govern.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="031911_0083_0FEF499D15A6F030">Upon a retro&s;pective view of the Hi&s;tory of Europe, it will be found, that for a long time after the birth of CHRIST, Germany was divided among &s;uch petty rulers as I have de&s;cribed, who each held his little &s;tate in &s;overeignty, and was called <HI>Princeps</HI> in Latin, or, in plain Engli&s;h, <HI>Prince.</HI> After the downfal of the We&s;tern Empire, a nation called <HI>Franks,</HI> from that part called <HI>Franconia,</HI> over-ran a great part of Gaul and Germany, and in the fifth century took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that part of Gaul which lay north of the river Loire. In the year 800, CHARLEMAGNE, the &s;on of PEPIN, their king, formed an immen&s;e em|pire in the we&s;t, comprehending a great part of Ger|many, France, Italy, and a part of Spain. About eighty years afterwards, the petty princes of Germany &s;hook off the French Carlovinian race, and elected an emperor of their own from the Hou&s;e of Bavaria.</P>
<P>At la&s;t HENRY the Fourth, having di&s;plea&s;ed that grand arbiter the Pope, was put under the ban, and in con&s;equence depo&s;ed by the &s;tates; on which occa|&s;ion his Holine&s;s had the addre&s;s to make that great dignity elective, he having uncontroled power over the electors; &s;ince which it has continued &s;o, with &s;ome modifications, and under certain regulations, formed by CHARLES the Fourth, at the diet of Nu|remberg.

<P>In a country over which the Pope had &s;uch influ|ence, it might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that intolerance is carried to a great length; but it is not &s;o, as a re|view of each particular &s;tate &s;hews. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, in general, is Popery.

by a friar for it, it is true&mdash;tho&s;e days of pious bar|barity are pa&s;t; but he was vi&s;ited on the occa&s;ion by his Holine&s;s, who, after a variety of remon&s;trances again&s;t the relaxation he gave to religious &s;everity in his own dominions, finding him unmoved by papers, re&s;olved to attack him in per&s;on: but, whether it was that the pontifical amulet lo&s;t its charm when out of the air of Rome, or that his Holine&s;s was not pro|perly anointed before (like <HI>Hecate</HI> in <HI>Macbeth</HI>) he took his flight, or that he forgot &s;ome of tho&s;e reliques which were expected to operate on JOSEPH's mind, &s;o it was, that the good emperor continued inflexibly attached to his former re&s;olve; and, after ki&s;&s;ing his Holine&s;s' toe, and a thou&s;and other pretty polite|ne&s;&s;es, &s;ent him back to Rome again with his finger in his mouth; and a &s;tory to relate, that would, at one time, have &s;et all Europe in a flame, and &s;ent the good monarch, like HENRY the Second of England, to la&s;h him&s;elf naked over the rotten remains of &s;ome vagabond fraudulent prie&s;t.</P>
<P>In the election of emperor, the laws of the empire have laid down no qualification but that which ought to be the <HI>&s;ine qu&acirc; non</HI> of all princes, namely, that he be <HI>ju&s;tus, bonus, et utilis</HI>&mdash;Neither have they made any limitation in regard to religion, nation, &s;tate, or age; neverthele&s;s, the majority of electors being Papi&s;ts, a Roman Catholic prince is always cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The rank of the emperor is very great: he is looked upon by all crowned heads as the fir&s;t Euro|pean potentate; and, as &s;uch, precedence is always given him and his amba&s;&s;adors: he is the &s;upreme head of the German empire; but his power in the admini&s;tration thereof is very limited indeed. In an|cient times, the emperor had con&s;iderable domains and incomes; but warfare and prodigality have di&s;&s;i|pated the greate&s;t part of them, and they have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively alienated or mortgaged, &s;o that his reve|nues

He called upon his people to &s;upport him. The &s;tates of the Netherlands, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to &s;top the progre&s;s of the enemy, invited and opened their gates to them, put them in their bo&s;om, and were &s;tung.

A&s;&s;uredly, the im|po&s;ing a bi&s;hopric upon him mu&s;t be a great act of violence on his inclinations: for I cannot think it po&s;&s;ible that a Chri&s;tian divine would, in the fir&s;t place, commit the crime of &s;imony by &s;eeking prefer|ment, and gaining it by pro&s;titution; much le&s;s can I believe that he would be guilty, at the holy altar, of a &s;olemn act of perjury, by &s;wearing <HI>nolo epi&s;|copari,</HI> if he was not actually, and <HI>bon&acirc; fid&egrave;,</HI> aver&s;e to a bi&s;hopric.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Liege, however, may be fairly ac|quitted on the &s;core of his temporal half, for the &s;hare of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions committed by his &s;piritual half.

Such a &s;et of proud worldly titles are of them&s;elves &s;ufficient (putting the wine and beer, and repletion, out of the que&s;tion) to anni|hilate the &s;piritual merits of the bi&s;hop, and expunge the grace of GOD from his name here, if not from him&s;elf hereafter</P>

<P>In forming this con&s;titution, &s;pecial care has been taken to give the fir&s;t &s;tate a great preponderance.

In this di&s;tribution of the abbeys, male and female, I do not think that &s;uf|ficient regard has been had to equality of numbers: I really think the fathers have been ill u&s;ed.

<P>AIX-LA-CHAPELLE&mdash;The imperial city of Aix-la-Chapelle, by the Germans called Achen, lies at the di&s;tance of twenty-&s;ix miles, nearly ea&s;t, of Liege. As it was a moderate &s;tage, the weather fine, and the face of the country around beautiful, I found my journey extremely plea&s;ant, and entered that famous city in as good a di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed with it, as circum&s;tances and reflections &s;o melancholy as mine (which, in &s;pite of every effort, would intrude them|&s;elves) may be &s;uppo&s;ed to allow. It is certainly a very fine city, and well de&s;erves the reputation it has in all parts of the world.</P>
<P>Perhaps no city in Germany has a fairer claim to antiquity than Aix-la-Chapelle; for it was famous, even, in the time of the ancient Romans, for its waters, and was by them called <HI>Aqui&s;granum,</HI> or <HI>Urbs Aquen&s;is.</HI> It was de&s;troyed by the Huns, who, like the French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow, de&s;troyed and trampled under foot every ve&s;tige of refinement, wherever they carried their conque&s;ts; and it lay in ruins till it was rebuilt by CHARLE|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">AGNE, who made it the &s;eat of his empire on this

&s;ide of the Alps. By him it was ordained, the kings of the Romans &s;hould be crowned there: and it has been famous, &s;ince that time, for councils and treaties, particularly that famous one between France and Spain in 1663, and another lately between France and Great Britain.</P>
<P>Although there are many Prote&s;tants, both Luthe|rans and Calvini&s;ts, in this city, they are obliged to go to church two miles off, at a place called Vaels, in the dutchy of Limburg; &s;o that Popery prevails with &s;ome portion of its intolerance. Here, as in all other places &s;ubject to its power, it has rai&s;ed the Gothic gloomy pile, accumulated enormous ma&s;&s;es of wealth, and hoarded up trea&s;ures, under the gulling pretexts of religious paraphernalia: a golden ca&s;ket, &s;et with precious &s;tones of ine&s;timable value, is hoard|ed up, not for the actual value of the moveable, but as the only fit receptacle for a relique it contains&mdash;a curious one, too, even of its kind&mdash;a bit of earth!&mdash; A bit of earth? yes! a bit of earth, common earth! &mdash;only with this fortunate circum&s;tance in addition, that a drop of the blood of Saint STEPHEN fell, or is &s;aid to have fallen, upon it, as he was &s;toned to death! think of that, ma&s;ter FREDERICK! Why, when tho&s;e things occur to me, I feel my&s;elf agitated by a whim&s;ical tumult of &s;en&s;ations, &s;erious and ludi|crous, &s;orrowful and merry, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe&mdash;&s;omething like that &s;tate in which the &s;pirits flutter when a per&s;on whimpers between a laugh and cry. But, to carry the matter farther, when we re|collect that &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t and brighte&s;t of man|kind, &s;ome of the brave&s;t warriors, &s;terne&s;t philo&s;o|phers, and able&s;t &s;tate&s;men, that ever exi&s;ted, have been the dupes of tho&s;e &s;hallow artifices, and actually have knelt in devout homage to the&s;e bits of earth, bone, &s;ticks, and &s;tone, &amp;c. we mu&s;t allow that it an&s;wers a great and noble end, by pointing out to
<PB N="98" REF="031911_0094_0FEF49BB1D921180">
us the infirmity of our nature, and &s;hewing us, to u&s;e the words of one of our brighte&s;t luminaries, "what &s;hadows we are, and what &s;hadows we pur&s;ue!"</P>
<P>We have already had, and are likely yet to have, &s;uch a clum&s;y load of cathedrals to attend to, that I &s;hould not mention that of Aix-la-Chapelle (a large, gloomy, dreary, old-fa&s;hioned, Gothic pile), were it not that it carries along with it &s;ome matters worthy of notice. What think you, then, of an emperor, a pope, and three hundred and &s;ixty-five bi&s;hops, in one company? Oh! precious a&s;&s;emblage! But where, I hear you a&s;k&mdash;where, in the name of GOD, collect the bi&s;hops? a pope and emperor are ea&s;ily had! My dear FREDERICK, three hundred and &s;ixty-five bi|&s;hops might ea&s;ily be picked up in Chri&s;tendom, and leave more behind, too, than would &s;erve any u&s;eful purpo&s;e to the world.&mdash;Yes, the Emperor CHARLE|MAGNE, and three hundred and &s;ixty-five bi&s;hops, were pre&s;ent at the con&s;ecration of this cathedral by Pope LEO the Third. That emperor lies now in great &s;tate under the altar of the choir: Pope LEO rots in Rome; and for the bi&s;hops, they are gone, perhaps, as <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;ays, "to &s;top a beer barrel."&mdash;
<Q><L>"Th' imperial CAESAR, dead, and turn'd to clay,</L>
<L>Might &s;top a hole, to keep the wind away."</L></Q></P>
<P>From &s;uch a &s;plendid and opulent attendance at the con&s;ecration, one would naturally expect that this ca|thedral would have been, at the very out&s;et, enriched with co&s;tly and valuable trappings: but no&mdash;one image of that of Liege would purcha&s;e the whole. It &s;hould be recollected, however, that they were all, excepting the emperor, Churchmen&mdash;a cla&s;s, who&s;e charity, generally &s;peaking, has, like a ring, neither end nor beginning ; or at lea&s;t ends and begins in it|&s;elf, where nobody can &s;ee it; or, according to the old proverb, begins at home.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="031911_0095_0FEF49BDD7934B28">To compen&s;ate, however, for tho&s;e worldly, worth|le&s;s vanities, gold, &s;ilver, and jewels, his Holine&s;s, and their three hundred and &s;ixty-five Graces, pre&s;ented the cathedral with &s;ome exqui&s;ite pieces of relique, of more ine&s;timable value, by their account, than the mines of Poto&s;i or Golconda: the fir&s;t, an old cover|ing&mdash;it would be folly for me to &s;ay, whether gown, petticoat, or &s;hift&mdash;but they, that is to &s;ay, the prie&s;ts, &s;ay, and the faithful believe them, that it was the &s;hift worn by the Virgin MARY at the birth of CHRIST&mdash;how their Holine&s;&s;es came by it, is hard to conjecture:&mdash;in the next place, a piece of coar&s;e cloth, which, they al&s;o &s;ay, and are believed when they &s;ay, was girt about CHRIST on the cro&s;s:&mdash;thirdly, a piece of cord, with which they &s;ay he was bound: &mdash;fourthly, &s;ome of the blood of Saint STEPHEN, now eighteen hundred years old:&mdash;and, fifthly, a picture of the Virgin and Child, embo&s;&s;ed on a ja&s;per, by Saint LUKE. With all due deference to their Reve|rences' knowledge, I &s;hould think a dozen &s;tatues in gold of the apo&s;tles would be rather a more valuable gift, and more ornamental, than the&s;e rags and cords, which I dare &s;ay did not co&s;t altogether &s;ix pence. We talk here of our blue ribbons, our red ribbons, and our &s;tars, as great donations; but I think the pre&s;ents of the Pope and three hundred and &s;ixty-five bi&s;hops to the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle, beat them out of the field, whether we con&s;ider the mag|nificence of the gift, or the genero&s;ity of the givers.</P>
<P>But that which, above all things, renders Aix-la-Chapelle worthy of notice, is the &s;alubrity of its wa|ters, which bring from England, and all other Euro|pean nations, a va&s;t concour&s;e of valetudinarians, who contribute at once to the gaiety and opulence of the city and adjacent country. Some of tho&s;e waters are u&s;ed for drinking, and others for bathing, re&s;embling very much, in their quality, the virtues of tho&s;e of

<P>I &s;taid &s;o &s;hort a time at Aix-la-Chapelle, that I could not, without the aid of &s;ome of the miracles wrought by the &s;aints of the Romi&s;h church, or Sir JOHN MANDEVILLE, acquire a &s;ufficient knowledge of the people, to attempt a de&s;cription of them, or their manners&mdash;but it and Spa are &s;o well known, that you cannot have much trouble in finding a de|&s;cription of them already written.</P>
<P>As far as my ob&s;ervations enabled me to judge, there was nothing in the German character that had the power either to create intere&s;t, or excite great attention.&mdash;They are rather to be approved than ad|mired; and, wanting tho&s;e prominent features that &s;o whim&s;ically chequer other nations with the ex|tremes of bad and good, maje&s;tic and ridiculous, afford little &s;ubject to the traveller for the indulgence of &s;en|timental reflecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, or to the philo&s;opher for the ex|erci&s;e of moral &s;peculation.</P>

<P>BIDDING adieu to the famous city of Aix-la-Chapelle, which, very untraveller-like, I pa&s;&s;ed without drinking of its waters, I pu&s;hed on, and &s;oon arrived at the city of Juliers, the capital of a dutchy of that name, &s;ixteen miles from Aix. The country it&s;elf is wonderfully fruitful, teeming with abundance of all &s;orts of corn, wood, pa&s;ture, woad, coal, and cattle; above all, a mo&s;t excellent breed of hor&s;es, of which great numbers are exported.</P>
<P>As to the city, though a capital, there was no|thing in it that I thought worth attention&mdash;that of neatne&s;s is its greate&s;t prai&s;e. It is not, like Liege, overloaded with enormous church edifices; but, what is much better, the people are opulent, the poor well &s;upplied, and all happy. In all likelihood, this is owing to the inhabitants being a mixture of Prote&s;tant and Roman Catholic; for, by a treaty between the Elector Palatine and the Emperor of Brandenburg, re&s;pecting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the territories of the Duke of Cleves, both the Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts of this dutchy, and of Berg, are to enjoy the public exerci&s;e of their religion, and all other religious rites.</P>
<P>If experience would allow us to wonder at any thing in the management of the rulers of nations, it mu&s;t &s;urely be matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, that in an arti|cle of &s;uch con&s;equence as eternity, and which mu&s;t be directed by private &s;entiments alone, &s;uch violence &s;hould &s;y&s;tematically be offered to opinion, and that

mankind &s;hould be dragooned, as they have been for &s;o many weary centuries, into the profe&s;&s;ion of par|ticular modes of faith. Combating opinion by force is &s;o ab&s;urd, that I am &s;ure tho&s;e who have attempted it, never could flatter them&s;elves with the &s;lighte&s;t hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.

If it be objected that certain religious &s;ects are ho&s;tile to certain &s;tates, it may be an&s;wered, that they are &s;o becau&s;e the &s;tate is ho&s;tile to them.

<P>The &s;tates of this dutchy, and that of Berg, con&s;i&s;t of the nobility and the deputies of the four chief towns of each; and they lay claim to great privileges in their diets&mdash;but they are &s;ubject to the Elector Pa|latine, to whom they annually grant a certain &s;um for the ordinary charges of the government, be&s;ides ano|ther which bears the name of a free gift.</P>

<P>Travelling over a very even road, and a country extremely flat, (for from Aix-la-Chapelle I met with but one hill), I arrived at Cologne, the capital, not only of the archbi&s;hopric of that name, but of the Circle of the Lower Rhine.

&s;omewhat like that of our blind beggars in London, and productive of the &s;ame di&s;agreeable effect upon the &s;pirits. In &s;hort, I was not an hour in Cologne, when tho&s;e circum&s;tances, con&s;piring with the in&s;upera|ble melancholy of my mind, made me wi&s;h my&s;elf out of it.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, Cologne is a fine city; and if it be any &s;atisfaction to you to &s;pin tho&s;e fine imaginary ligaments that, in the brain of the book-worm, connect the ancient and modern world, I will inform you, that it was anciently called <HI>Colonia Agrippina,</HI> becau&s;e AGRIPPINA, the mother of NERO, was born there, and honoured it with a Roman colony, becau&s;e it was her birth-place. The mind, forced back to that period, and contemplating the mi&s;chiefs of that mon|&s;ter NERO, cannot help wi&s;hing that Cologne had been burnt the night of her birth, and Mi&s;s AGRIP|PINA buried in the ruins, ere &s;he had lived to give birth to that &s;courge of the world.</P>
<P>Although the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion here be the Roman Carholic, extraordinary as it may appear, they are very jealous of power; and though the elector, by his officers, admini&s;ters ju&s;tice in all crimi|nal cau&s;es, they will not permit him, in per&s;on, to re&s;ide above three days at a time in the city, nor to bring a great train with him when he vi&s;its it; for this rea&s;on he commonly re&s;ides at Bonne.</P>
<P>Cologne has a very con&s;iderable trade, particularly in Rheni&s;h wine; and its gin is reckoned the be&s;t in the world, and bears a higher price than any other in all the nations of Europe.</P>
<P>Like all great Roman Catholic cities, it has a profu|&s;ion of churches, cro&s;&s;es, miracles, &s;aints, and church trinkets; and I really think it has more &s;teeples and bells than any two cities in Germany. As Liege was called the Paradi&s;e of Prie&s;ts, this ought to be called the Golgotha of Skulls and Skull-caps. In the church

The &s;kulls of &s;ome of tho&s;e imaginary virgins are in &s;ilver ca&s;es, and others in &s;kull-caps, of cloth, of gold, and velvet. And in the church of Saint GERION, are no le&s;s than nine hundred heads of Moori&s;h cavaliers, of the army of the Emperor CON|STANTINE, (previous to that &s;aint's conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity), who they &s;ay was beheaded for refu&s;ing to &s;acrifice to idols: by the bye, the Popi&s;h divines burn, in&s;tead of beheading, for not &s;acrificing to idols&mdash;Every one of tho&s;e heads, however, has a cap of &s;carlet, adorned with pearls. The whole forms a &s;pectacle, no doubt, equally agreeable and edifying. It &s;truck me, however, as an extremely ludicrous &s;ight, malgre the &s;olemnity of &s;o many death's heads: and when their &s;tory was recounted, I could not help internally chuckling, and &s;aying (rather punningly, to be &s;ure), "Ah! what <HI>blockheads</HI> ye mu&s;t have been, to &s;uffer your&s;elves to be &s;eparated from your &s;nug warm bodies, rather than drop down and wor&s;hip an idol, in which &s;o many good Chri&s;tian divines have &s;hewn you an example!" This, you will conclude, I &s;aid to my&s;elf: an avowal of my &s;entiments in that place might have given my head a title to a &s;carlet cap and pearls; and as I had &s;ome further u&s;e for it, I did not think it expedient to leave it behind me in the church of Saint GERION&mdash;&s;o, very prudently, kept my mind to my&s;elf.</P>

This was too formidable an appeal to be &s;lighted; and &s;o, in homage to the &s;kulls and red caps, I put my hand in my pocket, and &s;topped his clamours.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e mi&s;erable modes of peculation are the mo&s;t pardonable of any produced by the church: we have no right to regret a trifle &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of compa&s;&s;ion, even when that compa&s;&s;ion is mi&s;taken; but our rea&s;on revolts at impo&s;ition, when it calls coercion to its aid, and a&s;&s;umes the name of right.</P>
<P>Without any national predilection, which you know I am above, I think our church affairs in Scotland are arranged upon a better &s;y&s;tem than any other that I know of: hence their clergy are in general examples worthy of imitation, for learning, piety, and moral conduct.</P>

<P>LABOURED inve&s;tigations to e&s;tabli&s;h con|nections between the hi&s;tory of the ancient and bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the modern world, and virulent di&s;putes about trifles of antiquity, &s;uch as in what year this place was built, or that great man was born, when and

where JULIUS CAESAR landed in England, whether he pa&s;&s;ed this road or that, what route HANNIBAL took over the Alps, and &s;uch like, are &s;o e&s;&s;entially unintere&s;ting, u&s;ele&s;s, and unimportant, &s;o unprofitable, and, one would think, &s;o painful too, that it is wonder|ful how &s;o many men of great learning have been unwi&s;e enough to employ their lives in the re&s;earch.</P>
<P>It does not follow, however, that when informa|tion that tends to recall to our minds the great men of antiquity is pre&s;ented to us, we &s;hould reject it. A man of cla&s;&s;ical ta&s;te and education feels a delight in tho&s;e little memorials of what gave him plea&s;ure in his youth. I know a gentleman, who, being at Se|ville, in Spain, travelled to Cordova, for no other purpo&s;e but to &s;ee the town where LUCAN and SE|NECA were born: and I dare &s;ay, that if you were at Cologne, you would be much plea&s;ed to &s;ee the town-hou&s;e, a great Gothic building, which contains a variety of ancient in&s;criptions; the fir&s;t to comme|morate the kindne&s;s of JULIUS CAESAR to the Ubii, who inhabited this place, and of whom you have found mention made by him in his Commentaries, and al&s;o his building two wooden bridges over the Rhine: a &s;econd commemorates AUGUSTUS &s;ending a colony here. There is al&s;o a cro&s;s-bow of whalebone, twelve feet long, eight broad, and four inches thick, which they who &s;peak of it conjecture to have belonged to the Emperor MAXIMIN. There are al&s;o &s;ome Ro|man in&s;criptions in the ar&s;enal, the import of which I now forget.</P>
<P>It is very extraordinary, but certainly a fact, that there are, about Cologne, families yet exi&s;ting, who indulge the &s;en&s;ele&s;s ambition of pretending to be de|&s;cended from the ancient Romans, and who actually produce their genealogies, carried down from the fir&s;t time this city was made a colony of the Roman em|pire. Of all kinds of vanity, this is perhaps the mo&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="031911_0104_0FEF4ABAE9417278">
extravagant: for, if antiquity merely be the object, all are equally high, &s;ince all mu&s;t have originated from the &s;ame &s;tock; and if it be the pride of belong|ing to a particular family who were di&s;tingui&s;hed for valour or virtue, a claim which often only &s;erves to prove the degeneracy of the claimant, it could not apply in the ca&s;e of a whole people: but this is among the frailties of humanity; and we are often &s;o dazzled with the &s;plendour of terre&s;trial glory, that we endeavour to be allied to it even by the mo&s;t re|mote and ridiculous connections. I heard of a man, who&s;e pride and boa&s;t, when drunk, was, that Dean SWIFT had once thrown his mother's oy&s;ters (&s;he was an oy&s;ter-wench) about the &s;treet, and then gave her half a crown as an atonement for the injury. On the &s;trength of this affinity did he call the Dean nothing but <HI>Cou&s;in Jonathan,</HI> though the Dean was dead be|fore he was born!</P>
<P>But of all the &s;tories I have ever heard as illu&s;tra|tive of this &s;trange ambition, that which the late Lord ANSON has left us is the mo&s;t &s;triking. When that great man was travelling in the Ea&s;t, he hired a ve&s;|&s;el to vi&s;it the i&s;land of Tenedos: his pilot, a modern Greek, pointing to a bay as they &s;ailed along, ex|claimed in great triumph, "There, ay, there it was that our fleet lay."&mdash;"What fleet?" interrogated ANSON&mdash;"Why, our Grecian fleet, at the &s;iege of Troy," returned the pilot.</P>
<P>While tho&s;e doughty de&s;cendants of the ancient Romans indulge the cheerle&s;s idea of their great and illu&s;trious line of ancient ance&s;try, the prince who rules them felicitates him&s;elf with the more &s;ub&s;tantial dignities and emoluments of his modern offices. As elector and archbi&s;hop of Cologne, he has dominion over a large, fruitful, and opulent country: he is the mo&s;t powerful of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical electors: he has many &s;uffragan princes, lay and &s;piritual, under him;
<PB N="109" REF="031911_0105_0FEF49D075292180">
and he is archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire. The revenues of his archbi&s;hopric amount annually to one hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds Sterling; and as elector, he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;everal other great benefices. I pre&s;ume, becau&s;e he is a prince, that he is a man of &s;en&s;e; and, I will venture to &s;ay, that, as &s;uch, he would not barter tho&s;e good things for the power to demon&s;trate that LUCRETIA was his aunt, BRUTUS his grandfather, and the great JULIUS CAE|SAR him&s;elf his cou&s;in-german.</P>
<P>CHRIST cho&s;e his di&s;ciples out of fi&s;hermen. The Chapter of Cologne is, perhaps, on the contrary, the very mo&s;t ari&s;tocratic body exi&s;ting, being compo&s;ed of forty canons, who are princes or counts of the em|pire&mdash;Of tho&s;e, twenty-five choo&s;e the archbi&s;hop, and may advance one of their own body to that great and wealthy dignity, if they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>From Cologne I proceeded to the town of Bonne, which is &s;aid to take its name from the plea&s;antne&s;s of its &s;ituation. Here the elector re&s;ides, and has a very fine palace. The country around is extremely fruitful and plea&s;ant, and is ble&s;&s;ed with mo&s;t of the good things which render the rich magnificent and happy, and remind the poor of their inferiority and wretchedne&s;s&mdash;particularly wine, which is here re|markably excellent. It contains churches, prie&s;ts, convents, cloi&s;ters, &amp;c.; but I need not mention them&mdash;what place could exi&s;t without them?</P>
<P>I &s;hould not forget to tell you, that, at this place, JULIUS CAESAR built one of his bridges acro&s;s the Rhine&mdash;works which would have handed down to po&s;terity the name of a common man, for the magni|tude of the &s;tructure and ingenuity of the contrivance, but are lo&s;t in the crowd of a&s;toni&s;hing talents which di&s;tingui&s;hed that brighte&s;t of mortals. The greate&s;t biographer of antiquity &s;ays of him, that he was as great a general as HANNIBAL, as great an orator as
<PB N="110" REF="031911_0106_0FEF49D20A1669A8">
CICERO, and as great a politician as AUGUSTUS; but it might be added, that he was among the fir&s;t poets of his day&mdash;that he was of the fir&s;t mechanical genius, and the fine&s;t gentleman, in Rome.</P>
<P>Nature &s;eems to have formed, in CAESAR, a com|pendious union of all human talents, as if to demon|&s;trate how unavailing they were when oppo&s;ed to &s;trict rigid hone&s;ty and virtue in the character of BRUTUS.</P>
<P>To go from Bonne to Frankfort, there are two ways&mdash;one over the mountains of Wetterania, the other up the river Rhine. I made no he&s;itation to adopt the latter, and was rewarded for my choice with the view of as fine a country, inhabited by as fine a race of people, as I had ever &s;een. Valleys filled with herds, plains enamelled with corn-fields, and the hills covered with vineyards, regaled the eye, and conveyed to the mind all the felicitating ideas of plenty, natural opulence, and true pro&s;perity. My anxiety, however, to get forward, and di&s;engage my|&s;elf from a &s;pecies of &s;olitude in a country where, though travelling is cheap, accommodations of mo&s;t kinds in the public hou&s;es are bad, induced me to pu&s;h on, without taking the time nece&s;&s;ary for making accurate ob&s;ervations on the country as I pa&s;&s;ed; &s;o that, gliding, as it were, imperceptibly, through a number of towns, of which I recollect nothing di&s;|tinctly but the names of Coblentz and Mentz, I ar|rived at the great, free, and imperial city of Frank|fort on the Maine.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall &s;top, for a &s;hort time, my relation, in order to give you time for ju&s;t reflection and exami|nation of what I have already written: and as, in the latter part of it, I have &s;kimmed very lightly over the country, I de&s;ire that you will &s;upply the deficiency of my information by clo&s;e re&s;earch in books; inform your&s;elf of the great outlines of the Germanic Con&s;titution; look back to its origin, its

<P>THE country about Frankfort is delightful, rich and fruitful, and watered by the beautiful river Maine, which divides the city into two parts, that on the north being called Frankfort, and that on the &s;outh, Saxenhau&s;en, from the Saxons, who are &s;up|po&s;ed to have been the founders of it. The city it&s;elf is large, populous, and rich, and di&s;tingui&s;hed for being the place where the emperor and king of the Romans is elected&mdash;though, by the appointment of CHARLEMAGNE, Cologne has a &s;uperior claim to that honour. The magi&s;trates, and great part of the inhabitants, are Lutherans or Calvini&s;ts; notwith|&s;tanding which, mo&s;t of the churches are in the hands of
<PB N="112" REF="031911_0108_0FEF49D8039EBA30">
the Roman Catholics&mdash;a laudable in&s;tance of the true tolerant &s;pirit of a wi&s;e and virtuous in&s;titution, and a heavy reflection upon, as well as a noble example to the Popi&s;h Powers of Europe.</P>
<P>The tetritory belonging to Frankfort is of very con&s;iderable extent; and the trade carried on through it, by means of the rivers Rhine and Maine, of very great importance, not only to the country it&s;elf, but to other commercial nations, and particularly to Great Britain, who&s;e manufactures are &s;ent to Frankfort, and thence circulated through the Continent, in ama|zing quantities.</P>
<P>The fairs of Frankfort are talked of all over Europe &mdash;of &s;uch importance are they in the world of com|merce. They are held, one at Ea&s;ter, and another in September, and continue for three weeks, during which time the re&s;ort of people there from all quarters is a&s;toni&s;hing. Every thing is done by the government to render them as attractive to merchants as po&s;&s;ible; and taxes or duties are extremely low&mdash;a bale of the value of ten or twenty thou&s;and crowns paying duty only about ten or eleven pence of our money. All commodities from all parts of the world are &s;old there, and circulated through the empire; but, particularly, books are &s;old in prodigious quantities. After the fairs are over, the &s;hops of the foreign merchants are &s;hut up, and their names written over their doors.</P>
<P>To give an idea of the great importance the&s;e fairs are to commerce, I need only mention, that in the pre&s;ent war, the impediments thrown by the French in the way of the tran&s;it of goods up the Rhine, and the &s;hutting up that fair, gave a mo&s;t alarming paraly&s;is to the manufacturing e&s;tabli&s;hments of Eng|land, and a &s;hock to public credit in con&s;equence, that would, but for the timely interference of Parliament, have, in all probability, been fatal to the national credit.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="031911_0109_0FEF49D9DFD4DD60">Frankfort is in many re&s;pects a plea&s;ant place: the merchants are extremely convivial and &s;ociable, and form clubs, where they meet to drink tea and coffee, and play at cards. There is a playhou&s;e al&s;o, a great number of coffee-hou&s;es, and other hou&s;es of enter|tainment in abundance. The country around is covered with woods and vineyards; and the circumjacent vil|lages are very plea&s;ant, and well &s;upplied with hou&s;es of entertainment, to which the inhabitants of the city re&s;ort in the Summer &s;ea&s;on; and the inns in Frankfort are excellent.</P>
<P>A &s;ingular cu&s;tom prevails here, which I think worth mentioning: Taverns are denoted by pine-trees planted before the doors of them; and the different prices of the wines in their cellars are marked in ciphers on the door-po&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the town here is pre&s;ented the original Golden Bull, or Pope's Authority, which contains the rules and orders to be ob&s;erved at the election of the Empe|rors. The Golden Bull is never &s;hown to &s;trangers but in the pre&s;ence of two of the council and the &s;ecretary&mdash;It is a little manu&s;cript in quarto, con&s;i&s;ting of forty-two leaves of parchment, with a gold &s;eal of three inches diameter, of the value of twenty ducats, hung to it by a cord of yellow &s;ilk. It is &s;aid to be written in Latin and Gothic characters, without diphthongs; and kept in a black box together with two written tran&s;lations of it into the German lan|guage.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of Frankfort, that the Roman Catholics po&s;&s;e&s;s the churches, the Lutherans the dignities, and the Calvini&s;ts the riches. It is therefore one of the few places in Chri&s;tendom where the churches and the riches do not go into the &s;ame hands.</P>
<P>From Frankfort to Aug&s;burgh, I pa&s;&s;ed through a number of towns, all of them &s;o very incon&s;iderable as not to merit any particular de&s;cription. The way
<PB N="114" REF="031911_0110_0FEF49DF5DF18AE8">
lies from the Palatinate though the Circle of Suabia. In the extreme end of the Palatinate, and immediately before entering the Dutchy of Wirtemberg, the country is covered with fir-trees, and money is &s;o &s;carce in it, that a loaf of wheaten bread, weighing eight pounds, co&s;ts but two pence.</P>
<P>This city of Aug&s;burgh is the capital of a bi&s;hopri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that name in the Circle of Suabia, and is worthy of the attention of the cla&s;&s;ical traveller for its anti|quity. About twelve years before the birth of CHRIST, AUGUSTUS CAESAR &s;ubdued all this country, and&punc; on the place where Aug&s;burgh now &s;tands, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a colony, gave the town the name of Augu&s;ta V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">licorum, and put it under the government of DRUSUS the brother of TIBERIUS, afterwards emperor of Rome. The inhabitants of this place were the Vin|delici, a branch of the Illyrians. But, ancient though it be, it has little more of antiquity to entitle it to notice than the bare name&punc; for it has been pillaged &s;o often, particularly by that mon&s;ter ATTILA, that there are &s;carcely any remains of its antiquity to be found.</P>
<P>Aug&s;burgh, is now, however a hand&s;ome city&mdash; the public buildings in general magnificent, and adorned with fountains, water engines of a curious con&s;truction, and &s;tatues.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t rich and &s;plendid part of the town belongs to a family of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> (origi|naly de&s;cended from a weaver), who enriched them|&s;elves by commerce, and one of whom rendered not only him&s;elf, but the whole family, con&s;picuous, by entertaining the emperor CHARLES the Fifth in a &s;u|perb manner, and &s;upplying him with money, and then throwing his bond into the fire; in return for which, the emperor, made him a count of the empire.</P>
<P>This city is remarkable for gold&s;miths' ware; and its mechanics are equal to any in the world, for works
<PB N="115" REF="031911_0111_0FEF49E2619F7BA0">
in gold, ivory, clocks, and time-pieces; and they en|grave better than any people in Germany, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> brings them con&s;iderable profits. But what they are, above all other people, eminent for, is the manufac|turing &s;teel-chains &s;o prodigiou&s;ly fine, that when one of them, of a &s;pan in length, has been put about the neck of a flea, it lifts up the whole of it as it leaps; and yet tho&s;e are &s;old for le&s;s than a &s;hilling of our money a piece.</P>
<P>Controver&s;y, and difference in religious opinions, which has almo&s;t, ever &s;ince the commencement of Chri&s;tianity, di&s;graced the human under&s;tanding, and defaced &s;ociety, impo&s;es upon the liberal, well-thinking traveller, the office of &s;atiri&s;t but too often. Aug&s;burgh, however, is a &s;plendid exception, and holds up a mo&s;t glorious &s;pectacle of manly &s;en&s;e, generous &s;entiment, ju&s;tice, and I will &s;ay policy too, vanqui&s;hing that &s;hark-jawed enemy of mankind, bigotry. The magi&s;|tracy of Aug&s;burgh is compo&s;ed of about an equal number of Prote&s;tants and Roman Catholics&mdash;their &s;enate con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-three Roman Catholics and twenty-two Lutherans, and their common Council of a hundred and fifty of each: The executive power is lodged in the &s;enate&mdash;the legi&s;lative authority in both bodies. But, what is hardly to be found any where, they all, as well as the people, agree together in the mo&s;t perfect harmony, notwith&s;tanding the differ|ence of religion; and at all tables but the communion table, they a&s;&s;ociate together, dip in the &s;ame di&s;h, and drink of the &s;ame cup, as if they had never heard of the odious di&s;tinction of Papi&s;t and Prote&s;tant, but as being bound to each other by the great and irrefragable bond of humanity: fellow-creatures, affected by the &s;ame feelings, impelled by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, labouring under the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ities, and heirs to the &s;ame &s;uffer|ings, their means of a&s;&s;uaging the one, gratifying or re|&s;i&s;ting another, and &s;upplying the third, are the &s;ame,

Touched with the &s;en&s;ations natural to a man who loved to &s;ee his fellow-creatures happy, my heart ex|panded to a &s;y&s;tem of peace and harmony, compre|hending the whole globe: my mind expatiated invo|luntarily on the ble&s;&s;ings and advantages derived from &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem; and, taking flight from the bounds of practicability, to which our feeble nature is pinned on this earth, into the regions of fancy, had reared a fabric of Utopian mold, which, I verily believe, ex|ceeded in extravagance the works of all the Utopian architects that ever con&s;tructed ca&s;tles in the air.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="031911_0113_0FEF49E6F57CF670">Hurried on by this delightful vi&s;ion, my per&s;on paid an involuntary obedience to my mind; and the quick|ne&s;s of my pace increa&s;ing with the impetuo&s;ity of my thoughts, I found my&s;elf, before I was aware of it, within the chapel-door of the convent of the Carmelites. Ob&s;erving my error, I &s;uddenly turned about, in order to depart, when a friar, a goodly per&s;on of a man, elderly, and of a benign a&s;pect, called me, and, advancing towards me, a&s;ked, in terms of politene&s;s, and in the French language, why I was retreating &s;o abruptly&mdash;I was confu&s;ed: but truth is the enemy before whom confu&s;ion ever flies; and I told him the whole of my mi&s;take, and the thoughts from which they aro&s;e.</P>
<P>The good father, waving further di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject, but with a &s;mile which I thought carried a mixture of benevolence for my&s;elf, and contempt for my ideas, brought me through the church, and &s;hewed me all the curio&s;ities of the place, and particularly pointed out to me, as a great curio&s;ity, a &s;un-dial made in the form of a Madonna, the head enriched with rays and &s;tars, and in the hand a &s;ceptre which marked the hours.</P>
<P>Quitting the chapel, and going towards the refec|tory, the friar &s;tood, and, looking at me with a &s;mile of gaiety, &s;aid, "I have yet &s;omething to &s;hew you, which, while lady Madonna marks the time, will help us to pa&s;s it; and, as it will make its way with more force and &s;ubtlety to your &s;en&s;es than tho&s;e I have yet &s;hewn you, will be likely to be longer retained in remembrance.</P>
<P>He &s;poke a few words in German, which of cour&s;e I did not under&s;tand, to a vi&s;ion bearing the &s;hape of a human creature, who, I under&s;tood, was a lay-bro|ther; and, turning down a long alley, brought me to his cell, where we were &s;oon followed by the afore|&s;aid lay-brother, with a large earthen jug of liquor,
<PB N="118" REF="031911_0114_0FEF49EA129F0B48">
two gla&s;&s;es, and a plate with &s;ome delicately white bi&s;cuit.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know," &s;aid the friar, "that the con|vent of Carmelites at Aug&s;burgh has for ages been famed for beer unequalled in any part of the world; and I have brought you here to have your opinion&mdash; for, being an Engli&s;hman, you mu&s;t be a judge, the Britons being famed for luxury, and a perfect know|ledge of the <HI>&s;cavoir vivre.</HI>" He poured out, and drank to me: it looked liker the cleare&s;t Champaigne than beer&mdash;I never ta&s;ted any thing to equal it; and he &s;eemed highly gratified by my expre&s;&s;ions of prai&s;e, which I lavi&s;hed upon it, as well from politene&s;s, as regard to truth.</P>
<P>After we had drank a gla&s;s each, "I have been reflecting," &s;aid the friar, "on the &s;ingular flight of fancy that directed your &s;teps into this convent&mdash; Your mind was di&s;ea&s;ed, my &s;on! and a propitious &s;uperintending Power has guided your &s;teps to a phy|&s;ician, if you will but have the goodne&s;s to take the medicine he offers."</P>
<P>I &s;tared with vi&s;ible marks of a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"You are &s;urpri&s;ed," continued he; "but you &s;hall hear! When fir&s;t you di&s;clo&s;ed to me tho&s;e &s;ickly flights of your mind, I could on the in&s;tant have an|&s;wered them: but you are young&mdash;you are an En|gli&s;hman&mdash;two characters impatient of reproof: the dogmas of a prie&s;t, I thought therefore, would be &s;uf|ficiently difficult to be dige&s;ted of them&s;elves, with|out any additional di&s;ta&s;te caught from the chilling au&s;terity of a chapel!"</P>
<P>I looked unintentionally at the earthen jug, and &s;miled.</P>
<P>"It is very true," &s;aid he, catching my very in|mo&s;t thoughts from the expre&s;&s;ion of my countenance &mdash;"it is very true! good doctrine may, at certain times, and with certain per&s;ons, be more effectually
<PB N="119" REF="031911_0115_0FEF49EBA0F25F38">
enforced under the cheering influence of the &s;ocial board, than by the authoritative declamation and for|mal &s;anctity of the pulpit; nor am I, though a Carme|lite, one of tho&s;e who pretend to think, that a thing in it&s;elf good, can be made bad by decent hilarity, and the animation produced by a moderate and wi&s;e u&s;e of the goods of this earth."</P>
<P>I was a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;</P>
<P>"You fell into a reverie," continued he, "pro|duced by a contemplation of the happine&s;s of a &s;o|ciety exi&s;ting without any difference, and where no human breath &s;hould be wa&s;ted on a &s;igh, no ear tor|tured with a groan, no tears to trickle, no griefs or calamities to wring the heart."</P>
<P>"Yes, father!" &s;aid I, catching the idea with my former enthu&s;ia&s;m; "that would be my wi&s;h&mdash;that my greate&s;t, fir&s;t de&s;ire."</P>
<P>"Then &s;ee&s;t thou," interrupted he, "the extent of thy wi&s;h, &s;uppo&s;e you could realize it, which, thank GOD! you cannot."</P>
<P>"What! thank GOD that I cannot? are the&s;e your thoughts?"</P>
<P>"Yes, my &s;on; and ere Madonna marks the pro|gre&s;s of ten minutes with her &s;ceptre, they will be your's too."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"Hear me, my &s;on!&mdash;Is not death a horrible pre|cipice to the view of human creatures?"</P>
<P>"A&s;&s;uredly," &s;aid I&mdash;"the mo&s;t horrible: human laws declare that, by re&s;orting to it for puni&s;hment, as the ultimatum of all terrible inflictions."</P>
<P>"When, then," &s;aid he, "covered as we are with mi&s;ery, to leave this world is &s;o in&s;upportable to the human reflection, what mu&s;t it be if we had nothing but joy and felicity to ta&s;te of in this life? Mark me, child!" &s;aid he, with an animated zeal that gave an expre&s;&s;ion to his countenance beyond any thing I had
<PB N="120" REF="031911_0116_0FEF49EEDA174688">
ever &s;een: "the mi&s;eries, the calamities, the heart-rendings, and the tears, which are &s;o intimately inter|woven by the great arti&s;t in our natures as not to be &s;eparated in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, are in the fir&s;t place our &s;ecurity of a future &s;tate, and in the next place &s;erve to &s;lope the way before us, and, by gradual operation, fit our minds for viewing, with &s;ome &s;ort of fortitude, that hideous cha&s;m that lies between us and that &s;tate &mdash;death. View tho&s;e mi&s;eries, then, as &s;pecial acts of mercy and commi&s;eration of a beneficent Creator, who, with every calamity, melts away a link of that earthly chain that fetters our wi&s;hes to this di&s;mal world. Accept his ble&s;&s;ings and his goods, when he &s;ends them, with gratitude and enjoyment: receive his afflictions, too, with as joyous acceptance, and as hearty gratitude. Thus, and not otherwi&s;e, you will realize all your Utopian flights of de&s;ire, by turning every thing to matter of comfort, and living con|tented with di&s;pen&s;ations which you cannot alter, and, if you could, would mo&s;t certainly alter for the wor&s;e."</P>
<P>I &s;at ab&s;orbed in reflection&mdash;The friar, after &s;ome pau&s;e, proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P>"Errors ari&s;ing from virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and the love of our fellow-creatures, take their complexion from their parent motives, and are virtuous. Your wi&s;hes, therefore, my &s;on! though erroneous, merit reward, and, I tru&s;t, will receive it from that Being who &s;ees the rece&s;&s;es of the heart; and if the truths I have told you have not failed to make their way to your under&s;tanding, let your adventure of to-day im|pre&s;s this undeniable maxim on your mind&mdash;&s;o limited is man, &s;o imperfect in his nature, that the extent of his virtue borders on vice, and the extent of his wi&s;|dom on error."</P>
<P>I thought he was in&s;pired; and, ju&s;t as he got to the la&s;t period, every organ of mine was opened to take in his words.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="031911_0117_0FEF49F38E8D1518">"'Tis well, my &s;on!" &s;aid he&mdash;"I perceive you like my doctrine: then" changing his manner of &s;peaking, his expre&s;&s;ive countenance the whole time almo&s;t anticipating his whole words, "take &s;ome more of it," &s;aid he gaily, pouring out a fre&s;h gla&s;s. I pleaded the fear of inebriety&mdash;"Fear not," &s;aid he; "the beer of this convent never hurts the intellect."</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation continued till near dinner-time; for I was &s;o delighted, I &s;carcely knew how to &s;natch my&s;elf away: &s;uch a happy melange of piety and plea&s;antry, grave wi&s;dom and humour, I had never met. At length, the convent-bell tolling, I ro&s;e: he took me by the hand, and, in a tone of the mo&s;t complacent admonition, &s;aid, "Remember, my child! as long as you live, remember the convent of the Carmelites; and in the innumerable evils that cer|tainly await you if you are to live long, the words you have heard from old Friar AUGUSTINE will afford you comfort."</P>
<P>"Father!" returned I, "be a&s;&s;ured I carry away from you a token that will never &s;uffer me to forget the ho&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lity, the advice, or the politene&s;s of the good father AUGUSTINE. Poor as I am in natural means, I can make no other return than my good wi&s;hes, nor leave any impre&s;&s;ion behind me: but as my e&s;teem for you, and perhaps my vanity, make me wi&s;h not to be forgotten, accept this, (a &s;eal ring, with a device in hair, which I happened to have on my finger); and whenever you look at it, let it re|mind you of one of tho&s;e, I dare &s;ay innumerable, in&s;tances, in which you have contributed to the hap|pine&s;s and improvement of your fellow-creatures."</P>
<P>The good old man was affected, took the ring, and attended me to the convent gate, pronouncing many ble&s;&s;ings, and charging me to make Aug&s;burgh my way back again to England if po&s;&s;ible, and take one gla&s;s more of the convent ale.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>LEAVING Aug&s;burgh, I travelled through Bavaria a long way before I reached the Tyrol Coun|try, of the natural beauty of which I had heard much, and which I therefore entered with great expecta|tions of that &s;ublime gratification the beauties of na|ture never fail to afford me. I was not di&s;appointed; indeed, my warme&s;t expectations were exceeded.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes a traveller from Bava|ria, on entering it, is the fort of Cherink, built be|tween two inacce&s;&s;ible rocks which &s;eparate Tyrol from the bi&s;hopric of Frei&s;ingen. So amply has na|ture provided for the &s;ecurity of this country again&s;t the incur&s;ion of an enemy, that there is not a pa&s;s which leads to it that it is not through &s;ome narrow defile between mountains almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible; and on the rocks and brows of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es, the emperor has con&s;tructed forts and citadels, &s;o advantageou&s;ly pla|ced, that they command all the valleys and avenues beneath.</P>
<P>After a variety of windings and turnings through mountains of &s;tupendous height and awful a&s;pect, I began to de&s;cend, and entered the mo&s;t delightful val|ley I had ever beheld&mdash;deep, long, and above a mile in breadth&mdash;&s;urrounded with enormous piles of moun|tains, and diver&s;ified with the alternate beauties of nature and cultivation, &s;o as to form an union rarely to be met with, and delight at once the eye of the farmer, and the fancy of him that has a true ta&s;te for
<PB N="123" REF="031911_0119_0FEF49F6C7FCA1C8">
rural wildne&s;s. From the heights in de&s;cending, the whole appeared in all its glory; the beautiful river Inn gliding along through it longitudinally, its banks &s;tudded with the mo&s;t romantic little villages, while a number of inferior &s;treams were &s;een winding in dif|ferent cour&s;es, and ha&s;tening to pour their tribute into its bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Here I felt my heart overwhelmed with &s;en&s;ations of tran&s;port, which all the works of art could never in&s;pire: here nature ru&s;hed irre&s;i&s;tible upon my &s;en&s;es, and, making them captive, exacted their ac|knowledgment of her &s;upremacy: here vanity, ambi|tion, lu&s;t of fame and power, and all the tin&s;elled, gaudy frippery to which habit and wordly cu&s;tom en|&s;lave the mind, retired, to make way for &s;entiments of harmony, purity, &s;implicity, and truth: here Pro|vidence &s;eemed to &s;peak in language mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive, "Come &s;illy man, leave the wild tumult, the endle&s;s &s;truggle, the glittering follies, the fal&s;e and &s;purious plea&s;ures which artifice creates, to &s;educe you from the true&mdash;dwell here, and in the lap of nature &s;tudy me:" Here, oh! here, exclaimed I, in a tran&s;port which bereft me, for the time, of every other con&s;i|deration, here will I dwell for ever. The charm was too finely &s;pun, to with&s;tand the hard tugs of fact; and all its precious delu&s;ions vani&s;hed before a ho&s;t of gloomy truths&mdash;deranged affairs&mdash;family far off, with the di&s;tance daily increa&s;ing&mdash;the hazards and the hard&s;hips of a long untried journey&mdash;and the Ea&s;t In|dies, with all its horrors, in the rear. I hung my head in &s;orrow; and, offering up a prayer to protect my family, &s;trengthen my&s;elf, and bring us once more together in &s;ome &s;pot heavenly as that I pa&s;&s;ed through, was proceeding on in a &s;tate of dejection proportionate to my previous tran&s;ports, when I was rou&s;ed by my po&s;tillion, who, pointing to a very high, &s;teep rock, de&s;ired me to take notice of it. I did &s;o;
<PB N="124" REF="031911_0120_0FEF49FA00D96C28">
but &s;eeing nothing very remarkable in its appearance, a&s;ked him what he meant by directing my attention to it&mdash;He an&s;wered me in the following manner, which, from the &s;ingularity of the narrative, and his &s;trange mode of telling it, I think it would injure to take out of his own words: I will, therefore, endeavour, as well as I can, to give you a literal tran&s;lation of it; and, indeed, the impre&s;&s;ion it made on my memory was &s;uch, that, I apprehend, I &s;hall not materially dif|fer from his words:</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know, Sir, (for every one in the world knows it), that all the&s;e mountains around us, are the abodes of good and evil &s;pirits, or genii&mdash;the latter of whom are continually doing every malicious thing they can devi&s;e, to injure the people of the country, &mdash;&s;uch as leading them a&s;tray&mdash;&s;mothering them in the &s;now&mdash;killing the cattle by throwing them down precipices&mdash;nay, when they can do no wor&s;e, drying up the milk in the udders of the goats&mdash;and, &s;ome|times, putting between young men and their &s;weet-hearts, and &s;topping their marriage. Ten thou&s;and cur&s;es light upon them! I &s;hould have been married two years ago, and had two children to-day, but for their &s;chemes. In &s;hort, Sir, if it were not for the others&mdash;the good ones&mdash;who are always employed (and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin knows they have enough on their hands) in preventing the mi&s;chiefs of tho&s;e devils, the whole place would be de&s;troyed, and the country left without a living thing, man or goat!"</P>
<P>Here I could not, for the life of me, retain my gravity any longer, but bur&s;t, in &s;pite of me, into an immoderate fit of laughter, which &s;o di&s;concerted and offended him, that he &s;ullenly refu&s;ed to proceed with the &s;tory and farther, but continued marking his fore|head (his hat off) with a thou&s;and cro&s;&s;es, uttering pious ejaculations, looking at me with a mixture of terror, di&s;tru&s;t, and admiration and every now and then
<PB N="125" REF="031911_0121_0FEF49FE5AAB31B8">
glancing his eye a&s;kance toward the hills, as if fearful of a de&s;cent from the evil &s;pirits.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity was awakened by the very exraordinary commencement of his narrative; and I determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to hear it out: &s;o, a&s;&s;uring him that I meant nothing either of &s;light or wickedne&s;s by my laughter &mdash;that I had too &s;erious ideas of &s;uch things to treat them with levity&mdash;and, what was more convincing logic with him, promi&s;ing to reward him for it&mdash;he proceeded with his &s;tory as follows:</P>
<P>"Well, Sir, you &s;ay you were not &s;porting with tho&s;e &s;pirits&mdash;and fortunate it is for you: at all events, Saint JOHN of GOD be our guide, and bring us &s;afe to Inn&s;pruck. Ju&s;t &s;o the great MAXIMILIAN was wont to laugh at them; and you &s;hall hear how he was pu|ni&s;hed for it&mdash;and that was the &s;tory I was about to tell you. The Emperor MAXIMILIAN, that glory of the world, (he is now in the lap of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin in Paradi&s;e), once on a time, before he was emperor, that is to &s;ay, when he was archduke, was always laughing at the country people's fears of tho&s;e &s;pirits &mdash;and an old father of the church forewarned him to beware, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;uffer for his ra&s;hne&s;s: &s;o one day he went out hunting, and at the foot of that mountain a mo&s;t beautiful chamois &s;tarted before him; he &s;hot at it, and mi&s;&s;ed it&mdash;(the fir&s;t &s;hot he had mi&s;&s;ed for many years, which you know was warning enough to him)&mdash;however, he followed, &s;hooting at and mi&s;&s;ing it, the animal &s;tanding every now and then till he came up within &s;hot of it: thus he con|tinued till near night, when the goat di&s;appeared of a &s;udden, and he found him&s;elf buried, as it were, in the bowels of the mountain: he endeavoured to find his way out, but in vain; every &s;tep he took led him more a&s;tray, and he was for two days wan|dering about, CHRIST &s;ave us! in the frightful hollows of tho&s;e mountains, living all the time on wild berries:
<PB N="126" REF="031911_0122_0FEF49FFEDAAF6B8">
on the &s;econd night be bethought him&s;elf of his want of faith, and of the &s;aying of old Father JEROME; and he fell on his knees, and wept and prayed all night; and the Virgin heard his prayers, he being a good man, and, above all, an emperor&mdash;GOD ble&s;s you and me! we &s;hould have peri&s;hed&mdash;In the morning a beau|tiful young man, dre&s;&s;ed in a pea&s;ant's habit, came up to him, gave him victuals and wine, and de&s;ired him to follow him, which he did, you may be &s;ure, joyfully&mdash;but, Oh&punc; ble&s;&s;ed Virgin! think what his &s;urpri&s;e mu&s;t have been, when, getting again into the plain out of the mountain, the young man di&s;appeared and vani&s;hed all of a &s;udden, ju&s;t at the foot of that &s;teep rock which I &s;hewed you, and which ever &s;ince goes by the name of the emperor's rock&mdash;You &s;ee what a dangerous place it is, and what dangerous &s;pirits they mu&s;t be that would not &s;pare even the holy Roman emperor. In my mind, the be&s;t way is to &s;ay nothing again&s;t tho&s;e things, as &s;ome faithle&s;s people do, and to wor&s;hip the Virgin and keep a good con&s;cience, and then one will have the le&s;s to fear."</P>
<P>By the time he had ended his narrative, we were in &s;ight of Inn&s;pruck, when I annoyed and terrified him afre&s;h, by laughing immoderately at the end of his &s;tory&mdash;but atoned in &s;ome mea&s;ure for it, by giving him half a florin.</P>
<P>On inquiring at Inn&s;pruck, I found that MAXIMI|LIAN had actually lo&s;t his way in the mountain, and had been conducted out of it by a pea&s;ant, who left him &s;uddenly; the re&s;t was an exaggerated traditionary tale, ari&s;ing from the &s;uper&s;titious fears of the country people.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>IN all nations under Heaven, and at all times &s;ince the creation there have been men formed to make a noi&s;e in the world&mdash;to increa&s;e or impede, to direct or di&s;turb, the calm, &s;ober progre&s;s of &s;ocial life &mdash;and, in the eagerne&s;s and violence of their efforts to reach the goal of &s;uperiority, overturn or thru&s;t out of their ordinary path the re&s;t of mankind, till either they provoke again&s;t them a general con&s;piracy of their fellow-creatures, or, till reaching the point of their pur&s;uit, they become elevated objects of homage and admiration. Such men are generally compo&s;ed of great materials for mi&s;chief:&mdash;having &s;trong natural talents and violent ungovernable &s;pirits; according to the direction the&s;e get, they are harmle&s;s or mi&s;chievous &mdash;but, like morbid matter in the animal &s;y&s;tem, if not let loo&s;e by &s;ome channel or other, they never fail to di&s;turb the whole economy of the body they belong to, and produce fatal con&s;equences to it and to them|&s;elves: Colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have, therefore, in &s;ome views, been of u&s;e (as America formerly to England) to draw off tho&s;e dangerous &s;pirits, who, though they are in times of peace better at a di&s;tance, in times of war are found to be the toughe&s;t &s;inews of a nation.</P>
<P>The country of Tyrol, &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed it, formed by nature for the re&s;idence of the Sylvan deities, rich in the products of the earth, the people contented and happy, and the whole the region of peace; manu|factures, the fir&s;t root of low vices, and commerce, the
<PB N="128" REF="031911_0124_0FEF4A0327B11A30">
great in&s;tigator of war, have &s;carcely been able to &s;et their feet there: hence it happens, that there is no channel though which tho&s;e exuberant &s;pirits I have alluded to can take their cour&s;e, or expand their force. Home, therefore, is no place for tho&s;e of the Tyrole&s;e, who are cur&s;ed or ble&s;&s;ed (call it which you plea&s;e) with tho&s;e very combu&s;tible qualities; and they are obliged to roam abroad in &s;earch of opportunities of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves, giving vent to their &s;pirits, and manife&s;ting their talents. They are found, therefore, &s;cattered all over the Continent: and as it rarely happens that opportunities occur in life of &s;ignali&s;ing &s;uch talents in a dignified line, rather than be idle they do what they can, and apply to chicanery as a wide and appropriate field for their genius and vigour to work on&mdash;the emigrant Tyrole&s;e are, there|fore, by mo&s;t nations of the continent, reckoned among the mo&s;t expert and accompli&s;hed &s;harpers in the world&mdash;the people, however, who remain at home, are of a different character&mdash;they are, generally &s;peak|ing, tall, robu&s;t, and vigorous; the women &s;trong, and very fair; and both &s;exes exhibit a very plea&s;ing mixture of German phlegm and Italian &s;prightline&s;s; or, to &s;peak more properly, they are a mean between tho&s;e two extremes.</P>
<P>Inn&s;pruck, though a &s;mall city, is hand&s;ome and agreeable, &s;tanding in a very beautiful valley, &s;ur|rounded with mountains, which, while their lower parts are well cultivated, are capped on the tops with perennial &s;now. The ca&s;tle formerly the re&s;idence of the Au&s;trian princes is &s;tately and magnificent, adorned within with fine paintings, and decorated without by natural and artificial fountains, &s;tatues, plea&s;ant gar|dens, groves, walks, and covered galleries, leading to five different churches.</P>
<P><HI>A-propos</HI>&mdash;Let me not forget the churches! In a chapel of the Franci&s;can church, there is an image of
<PB N="129" REF="031911_0125_0FEF4A06A01BE4F8">
the Virgin MARY as big as the life, of &s;olid &s;ilver, with many other images of &s;aints of the &s;ame metal. If &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;ilver deities were transferred to Paris, I fear their divinity would not &s;ave them from the hands of the &s;acrilegious Convention. One thing, however, is well worth the attention of travellers, particularly tho&s;e who wi&s;h to wipe away the &s;ins of a decea&s;ed friend, and get them a direct pa&s;&s;port to happine&s;s&mdash;This Franci&s;can church is held to be one of the mo&s;t &s;acred and venerable in the world, on ac|count of the indulgences granted to it by &s;everal popes; &s;o that one &s;ingle ma&s;s &s;aid in it, is declared to be &s;ufficient to deliver a &s;oul from the pains of pur|gatory. When we con&s;ider the great and important extent of their power in that re&s;pect, we cannot won|der if they had all the &s;aints in the calendar, and the Virgin MARY to boot, in &s;olid &s;ilver, even of the &s;ize of the Colo&s;&s;us at Rhodes.</P>
<P>Hall, the &s;econd city in Tyrol, lies one league from Inn&s;pruck: it is famous for its &s;alt-works, and for a mint and &s;ilver mines, in which &s;even thou&s;and men, women, and children, are con&s;tantly employed.</P>
<P>At a royal palace and ca&s;tle called Ombras, lying at equal di&s;tance from Inn&s;pruck and Hall, there is an ar&s;enal, famous for a prodigious collection of curi|o&s;ities, &s;uch as medals, precious &s;tones, &s;uits of ar|mour, and &s;tatues of &s;everal princes on hor&s;eback, in their old rich fighting accoutrements; be&s;ides great Variety of military &s;poils and trophies taken by the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; in particular, a &s;tatue of FRANCIS the Fir&s;t and his hor&s;e, ju&s;t as they were taken at the battle of Pavia, and two others of Turki&s;h ba|&s;haws&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th the co&s;tly habits and appointments with which they were taken, embelli&s;hed with gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones. But, above all their curio&s;ities, the mo&s;t extraordinary is an oak inclo&s;ing the body of a deer: this la&s;t, however unaccountable, is fact;

and equals, I think, any of the wonders in the meta|morpho&s;es of OVID.</P>
<P>Leaving Inn&s;pruck, I proceeded on my journey, and &s;oon entered into the mountains, which are there of a terrible height&mdash;I was the be&s;t part of a day a&s;cending them: as I got near the top, I was &s;hewn, by my driver, the &s;pot where FERDINAND, king of Hungary, and the Emperor CHARLES the Fifth, met, when he returned from Africa, in the year 1520. It is marked with an in&s;cription to that effect, and has grown into a little village, which, from that circum|&s;tance, bears the name of the Salutation.</P>
<P>Although this mountain, called Bremenberg (or Burning-hill), is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ered with &s;now for nine months in the year, it is inhabited to the very top, and pro|duces corn and hay in abundance: at the highe&s;t part there is a po&s;t-hou&s;e, a tavern, and a chapel, where the traveller is accommodated with fre&s;h hor&s;es. pro|vi&s;ions, and, if he choo&s;es, a mouthful of prayers&mdash; I availed my&s;elf of the two fir&s;t; but the latter being not altogether in my way, I declined it, for which I could perceive that I was, by every mouth and eye in the place, con&s;igned to perdition as a heretic.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this &s;pot there is a &s;pring of water which falls upon a rock, and divides into two currents, which, at a very &s;mall di&s;tance, a&s;&s;ume the appear|ance, and, in fact, the magnitude too, of very large rivers. The mountain is &s;ometimes difficult to pa&s;s, &s;ometimes ab&s;olutely impracticable&mdash;I was fortunate, however, in this re&s;pect; for I got over it without any very extraordinary delay, and on my way was re|galed with the mo&s;t delicious veni&s;on that I have ever ta&s;ted in my life; it was &s;aid to be the fle&s;h of a kind of goat.</P>
<P>Although it is but thirty-five miles from Inn&s;pruck to Bri&s;en, it was late when I reached the latter; and as it contained nothing worth either the trouble or

delay attending the &s;earch of it, I &s;et out the next morning, and, travelling with high mountains on one &s;ide, and a river all along upon the other, arrived at a town called Bol&s;ano, in the bi&s;hopric of Trent. The country all along was thickly inhabited, and the mountains perfectly cultivated and manured even to their highe&s;t tops. On entering the valley of Bol|&s;ano, I found the air becoming obviou&s;ly &s;weet, de|lightful, and temperate; the vineyards, and all the trees and &s;hrubs, olives, mulberries, willows, and ro&s;es, &amp;c. all of the mo&s;t lively green, and every thing marking the mo&s;t luxuriant vegetation.</P>
<P>Bol&s;ano is a &s;mall, but extremely neat and plea&s;ant town&mdash;but nothing I &s;aw about it plea&s;ed me &s;o much as their vineyards, which are planted in long terraces along the &s;ides of the hills, and are formed into the mo&s;t beautiful arbours, one row above another.</P>
<P>From Bol&s;ano to Trent, is fifty-one miles, a good day's journey: almo&s;t the whole of it lies through the valley of Bol&s;ano, a mo&s;t fruitful and plea&s;ant&mdash;in|deed, delightful road, which made the day's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ourney appear to me much &s;horter than it really was.</P>
<P>Perhaps no part of the habitable globe is, within the &s;ame comparatively &s;mall compa&s;s of earth, &s;o wonderfully diver&s;ified by the hand of nature in all her extremes, as that through which I have ju&s;t carried you. There, under almo&s;t the &s;ame glance of the eye, were to be &s;een the &s;tupendous, the rugged, the &s;avage, and the inacce&s;&s;ible&mdash;the mild, the fruitful, and the cultivated.

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS the learned unwi&s;e men of the world, who &s;pend their lives poring after impo&s;&s;ibili|ties, have never met with a more copious &s;ubject of puzzle-pated enjoyment than the derivation of the names of places. In all di&s;puted ca&s;es on this &s;ubject, the utmo&s;t within human reach is conjecture; but the joke of it is, that, fortunately for mankind, the cer|tainty of it would not be of a &s;ingle button advantage to them, even if it could be acquired by their &s;earch. Doctor GOLDSMITH, in his <HI>Citizen of the World,</HI> has thrown this matter into high ridicule; and I recom|mend it to your peru&s;al, le&s;t this &s;hadow of literature &s;hould one day wheedle you from more re&s;pectable pur&s;uits. Trent has afforded va&s;t exerci&s;e to book|worm conj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res in this way; for, while &s;ome pro|nounce it to be derived from Tridentum, and for this purpo&s;e will have it that NEPTUNE was wor&s;hipped there, though &s;o far from the &s;ea&mdash;others claim the di&s;covery of its derivation from Tribus Torren|tibus,
<PB N="133" REF="031911_0129_0FEF4A15A674AA60">
or three &s;treams which run there. Now, as to the fir&s;t, exclu&s;ive of forcing NEPTUNE all the way from the Gulph of Venice to their temples, I cannot find any &s;uch &s;imilarity in the &s;ound of Trent and Trident to warrant the inference; and as to the Tri|bus Torrentibus, they might as well &s;ay that a prim|mer or hornbook was found there, and that thence it was derived from the alphabet, &s;ince the &s;ame analogy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, namely, that the letters T,R,E,N,T are to be found in both. But, in the name of God, what &s;ignifies what it was called after? Its name is Trent; and if it had been Putney, or John o' Groat's hou&s;e, the town would be neither the better nor the wor&s;e, nor the trea&s;ures of literature &s;uffer any defalcation from the difference.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hopric of Trent is about &s;ixty miles long, and forty broad&mdash;fertile, and abundant in wine, oil, fruit, and pa&s;ture&mdash;and plea&s;ant, the beautiful river Adige meandering through the whole of it from north to &s;outh. The inhabitants are bigoted Roman Catholics&mdash;you will the le&s;s wonder, then, that the bi&s;hop &s;hould have &s;o exten&s;ive a principality, and an annual revenue of forty thou&s;and crowns.</P>
<P>As I receded from Germany, and advanced towards Italy, I found the air, the per&s;ons, and the manners of the people, to di&s;play a very great difference, and to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Italians more than tho&s;e of the Germans. Though Popi&s;h bigotry be pretty &s;trong in many parts of Germany, it no where there a&s;&s;umes the gloomy, dete&s;table a&s;pect that it does in Italy.</P>
<P>And now, &s;ince I have happened to mention the characters of the&s;e two people, I may as well, once for all, more particularly as we are got to the verge of both, give you them in full; in both which I am warranted in &s;aying, that all who know the two will agree with me.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="031911_0130_0FEF4A17353F9B68">Perhaps contra&s;t was never more perfectly exem|plified than in a compari&s;on between the Germans and Italians; and that contra&s;t &s;trikes more forcibly and &s;uddenly in pa&s;&s;ing from one country to the other, than it would in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace between any two people exi&s;ting. The Italians, jealous, revengeful, trea|cherous, di&s;&s;embling, &s;ervile, vicious, &s;anguinary, idle, and &s;en&s;ual. The Germans, on the contrary, open, good-natured, free from malice and &s;ubtlety, labori|ous, &s;incere, hone&s;t, and ho&s;pitable&mdash;and, with tho&s;e valuable qualities, properly complai&s;ant. So happy is the character of this people, that to be German-hearted has long been a phra&s;e &s;ignifying an hone&s;t man who hated di&s;&s;imulation: and their ho&s;pitality was, even in the days of JULIUS CAESAR, remark|able; for we learn from him, that their hou&s;es were open to all men&mdash;that they thought it inju&s;tice to affront a traveller, and made it an article of their re|ligion to protect tho&s;e who came under their roof. Did not intemperance in eating and drinking detract from their virtues, no people on earth would bear compari&s;on with them for intrin&s;ic worth, and particu|larly for integrity in dealing.</P>
<P>The city of Trent, though not very large in circum|ference, is populous. The high mountains which &s;urround it, &s;ubject it to all the inconveniences of heat and cold&mdash;rendering the air exce&s;&s;ively hot in &s;um|mer, and extremely cold in winter; be&s;ides which, they expo&s;e the town to dreadful inundations&mdash;the torrents that de&s;cend from the mountains being &s;ome|times &s;o impetuous as to roll large pieces of rock with them into it, and having &s;everal times laid the whole place wa&s;te.</P>
<P>There are in Trent many &s;tately palaces, churches, and religious hou&s;es. The only one, however, that I will particularize, is that of Saint MARY MAJOR, noted for a prodigious large organ, which can be
<PB N="135" REF="031911_0131_0FEF4A1A6B3D84E0">
made to counterfeit all &s;orts of mu&s;ical in&s;truments, together with the &s;inging of birds, the cries of &s;everal bea&s;ts, and the &s;ounds of drums and trumpets, &s;o ex|actly, that it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h between the imitation and the reality. To what an end &s;uch an in&s;trument &s;hould be &s;et up in a place of wor&s;hip, I am at a lo&s;s to divine, unle&s;s it be to add to the rich, u&s;ele&s;s lumber that fills all tho&s;e of Popi&s;h countries.</P>
<P>But that which di&s;tingui&s;hes this church &s;till fur|ther, is, that it is the place where the famous Coun|cil of Trent was held, concerning the Reformation, at which four thou&s;and per&s;ons of a public character, laymen and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, a&s;&s;i&s;ted. This Council &s;at eighteen years before it did any thing: but at la&s;t the Pope contrived to get the a&s;cendant; and, after debating and deliberating &s;o long, not only the Pro|te&s;tants, but even the German and French nations, refu&s;ed to receive its decrees. Certain of the clergy, finding the a&s;cendancy that the negotiation of the Pope was getting in this council, &s;aid that the Holy Gho&s;t had been &s;ent there from Rome in a <HI>cloakbag!</HI></P>
<P>Trent once boa&s;ted a curio&s;ity&mdash;which indeed &s;till remains, though out of u&s;e&mdash;that, I think, would be found &s;erviceable in mo&s;t towns in Chri&s;tendom, and el&s;ewhere too, and particularly at Bath, and &s;uch places. It was a tower on the river Adige, into which the &s;tream was conducted, for the purpo&s;e of drowning &s;uch of the clergy as were convicted of having been too familiar with their neighbours' wives and daughters!</P>
<P>The people of Trent &s;peak promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and in|differently, both the German and Italian languages; but whether well or not, I was not adept enough to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>My next &s;tage was Ba&s;&s;ano, a town in the territory of Vincenza in Italy, &s;ituated at the end of a very long narrow valley. It is watered by the river Brenta,
<PB N="136" REF="031911_0132_0FEF4A1C005EC1D0">
which wa&s;hes that very rich, fertile, &s;erene, healthy, and plentiful di&s;trict of Italy, &s;o celebrated for its ad|mirable wines, as well as for its fine pa&s;ture-grounds, rich corn-fields, and prodigious abundance of game, cattle, and mulberry-trees; from all which it is called the Garden and Shambles of Venice.</P>
<P>The next day I arrived at an early hour at Venice, the de&s;cription of which I &s;hall not injure by commen|cing it with the mutilated fragment of a letter, and &s;hall therefore po&s;tpone it to my next.</P>
<P>THUS, my dear FREDERICK, have I, in order to pre&s;erve the unity and order of my progre&s;s, brought you through Germany with a preci&s;e regularity, that, if I was not wi&s;hing for your improvement, might be di&s;pen&s;ed with&mdash;yet have left much, very much in|deed, untouched, in the confidence that you will your|&s;elf have the indu&s;try to find it out.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, my dear boy, that I have often, as I wrote, detected my&s;elf in excur&s;ions from the road into moral reflection&mdash;but I could not &s;top: your im|provement was my object in undertaking the bu&s;ine&s;s; and I could not refrain from endeavouring to inculcate &s;uch le&s;&s;ons as the progre&s;s of the work &s;ugge&s;ted, and as impre&s;&s;ed my mind with a conviction of their truth and utility.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that there are two to|pics on which I dwell very much&mdash;one, LIBERTY&mdash; the other, an abhorrence of bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition. But, before I proceed further, I mu&s;t call to your re|membrance what I have often &s;aid, that by liberty I do not mean that which &s;ome people now give that name to&mdash;nor do I mean religion when I &s;peak of bigotry; for true liberty is &s;till more incompatible with anarchy than with de&s;poti&s;m, and &s;uper&s;tition is the greate&s;t enemy of religion. Let the fir&s;t object of your heart and &s;oul be true morality&mdash;the next, rati|onal
<PB N="137" REF="031911_0133_0FEF4A20AE71E480">
liberty: but remember, that the one is not to be found independent of religion, nor the other ever to be enjoyed but under the re&s;training hands of whole|&s;ome laws and good government&mdash;&s;uch as England now boa&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the&s;e times, when human opinion is actually polled on the two extremes of political judgment, I know, that to &s;peak rationally, is to incur the cen&s;ure of both, or to be, as POPE &s;omewhere &s;ays, "by tories called a whig, by whigs a tory:" but I care not&mdash;I &s;peak my opinion with the fair face of inde|pendence; nor would &s;cruple to tell the KING of PRUSSIA my hatred of de&s;poti&s;m, or the Convention of France my abhorrence of anarchy&mdash;between both of which the true and genuine point of liberty lies; and England, thank God! draws the line.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>AS I approached Venice, I was much de|lighted with its appearance. Its &s;tately &s;teeples and noble buildings &s;eemed as if ju&s;t emerging from the &s;ea, and floating on the &s;urface of it; and it required no great &s;tretch of fancy to imagine, that it undulated with the agitated waves of its parent the Adriatic. On all the &s;urrounding coa&s;ts, nature and art &s;eemed to have vied with each other in pouring the greate&s;t profu&s;ion of their gifts, while thou&s;ands of ma&s;ts, &s;cattered like fore&s;ts over the &s;urrounding bays, denoted that Venice, not content with her own, &s;hared in the wealth and luxuries of other climes.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="031911_0134_0FEF4A2242215960">It is indeed difficult to conceive a more extraordinary and plea&s;ing appearance than this city makes at a di&s;tance, whether you approach it from the &s;ea or from the continent. Built not like towns in Holland, where immen&s;e moles and walls pu&s;h the &s;ea forward, and encroach on his dominion, it &s;tands on piles erected in the &s;ea; and the foundations of the hou&s;es almo&s;t touching the water, gives it the appearance of floating on its &s;urface. The &s;teeples are &s;een at &s;ea at the di&s;tance of thirty miles; and the pro&s;pect becomes more beautiful the nearer it is approached&mdash;pre&s;ent|ing in many views the appearance of floating i&s;lands.</P>
<P>To erect a city thus upon the water, while &s;o many thou&s;ands of acres &s;tand unoccupied, at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eems extrardinary&mdash;but all tho&s;e great and &s;trange devia|tions from the ordinary path pre&s;ented by nature, have their &s;ource in nece&s;&s;ity; and it is not till long after the nece&s;&s;ity has been fir&s;t lamented, and afterwards obviated, that experience comes into aid, and demon|&s;trates, that, from her, &s;ecurity and utility have often ari&s;en. Thus it is with Venice, who, fortified by her local &s;ituation (the effort of nece&s;&s;ity), &s;its &s;ecure, and bids defiance to the world.</P>
<P>The place where Venice now &s;tands, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been formerly a mar&s;hy ground, on which the Adriatic Sea had gradually encroached, leaving the more elevated parts of it above water, and thereby forming a va&s;t number of little i&s;lands, hence called Lagunes: on tho&s;e the fi&s;hermen of the neighbouring &s;hores built their huts; and when Italy was invaded by the Goths under ALARIC, and afterwarks by that babarous race the Huns, under ATTILA, both of whom &s;pread ruin and de&s;olation wherever they came, va&s;t num|bers of people from the circumjacent &s;hores of the Adriatic, particularly from Padua and Aquileia, fled hither, and brought along with them immen&s;e wealth. Here they laid the fir&s;t foundations on &s;eventy-two
<PB N="139" REF="031911_0135_0FEF4A258CFF2218">
di&s;tinct little i&s;lands, and certainly with huts, of a city which afterwards &s;tood almo&s;t foremo&s;t in the naval and commercial world: as tho&s;e i&s;lands were built upon, and became over-peopled, they gradually pu&s;hed forward their piles, and built upon them again, till the whole became one va&s;t city, extending to many more of tho&s;e i&s;lands beyond the original &s;eventy-two.</P>
<P>As it was indebted in a great mea&s;ure, for its ri&s;e and importance to the commerce of the Ea&s;t, which then was carried on by way of the Red Sea and Alexandria, when the pa&s;&s;age by the Cape of Good Hope was di&s;covered, that trade declined and Venice declined gradually along with it.</P>
<P>It is amazing, what an extent of territory and ac|cumulation of power the Venetians once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Be&s;ides their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which comprehend the territories of Padua and Verona, the Vincentine, the Bre&s;cians, the Bergama&s;es, the Crema&s;co, the Pole&s;in of Rovigo, Marca Trevigiana, the Patria del Friuli, and I&s;tria, they had under their dominion the i&s;lands of Rhodes, Scio, Samos, Mytilene, Andros, Candia, the Morea, and the cities of Gallipoli and The&s;&s;alonica: be&s;ides which, they, in conjunction with France, took Con&s;tantinople, and remained for &s;ome time ma&s;ters of that part of the Empire; and di&s;puted the dominion of Sclavonia, Croatia, Morlachia and Dal|matia, with the Kings of Hungary, and contended with the Genoe&s;e for the empire of the &s;ea: but of a great part of the&s;e, and their other conque&s;ts, they have &s;ince been &s;tripped, almo&s;t entirely, by the Turks.</P>
<P>As to the government of Venice, I &s;hall not enter into any particulars of its hi&s;tory&mdash;It is called a repub|lic, and was once a democracy. The name remains, while that which gave it is gone. It is, certainly, now a downright ari&s;tocracy&mdash;the privilege of &s;itting in the great Council being confined to the nobility;
<PB N="140" REF="031911_0136_0FEF4A2890A375E0">
and the doge, under the name of head, being no more than a gaudy &s;lave, loaded with fetters: yet, &s;uch is the idle fondne&s;s of man for &s;uperficial pomp, that this office is &s;ought after with avidity; for though his power be &s;mall, his &s;tate is very &s;plendid. Hence it is &s;aid, that the doge of Venice is a king in his robes, a &s;enator in council, a pri&s;oner in the city, and a private man out of it; and what is more ex|traordinary, is, that though he may be depo&s;ed, he cannot re&s;ign&mdash;nor even decline the office, if he be once cho&s;en, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to bani&s;hment, and his effects to confi&s;cation.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this &s;tate is the Roman Catholic; but the Venetians are not bigots, and reject the &s;upremacy of the Pope. Jews, Armenians, Greeks, and Prote&s;tants, are allowed the exerci&s;e of their religion there; and, provided they do not intermeddle with &s;tate affairs, of which they are extremely jealous, even their prie&s;ts, monks, and nuns, may take almo&s;t any liberties they plea&s;e&mdash;a privilege that you may be a&s;&s;ured is not neglected by any of them.</P>
<P>As few places have excited greater admiration and attention than Venice, &s;o none have been more copi|ou&s;ly de&s;cribed by travellers, every one of whom may, when he returns to his native country, give a very accurate account of the public buildings, curio&s;ities, paintings, &amp;c. by only tran&s;lating the book given to him by his valet de place, or cicerone, on his arrival there&mdash;It is certain, Venice abounds with all tho&s;e, particularly paintings; but I had not the time minutely to inve&s;tigate; nor &s;hould I have the inclination, if I did, to de&s;cribe &s;uch things: they are open to you in many well written volumes, which I recommend to your per&s;ual.

<P>The fir&s;t peculiarity that &s;trikes me, as ari&s;ing immediately from their living, I may &s;ay, in the &s;ea, is the total exclu&s;ion of all &s;ort of carriages; for tho&s;e &s;treets that are on firm ground are extremely nar|row and crooked; and on mo&s;t of the canals, &s;o far from having a quay on either &s;ide to walk on, the water comes up to the doors of the hou&s;es; &s;o that walking is but little known, for they get into a boat off their thre&s;hold, and their fir&s;t &s;tep out of it again is, ten to one, on the thre&s;hold of another.

This is a &s;ubject on which I am, neverthele&s;s, di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that more has been &s;aid than truth will bear out&mdash;yet, a bare &s;tatement of the truth, would I fear, bear hard enough upon the moral character, or at lea&s;t the piety, of the Venetians.</P>
<P>That ma&s;querades are the very wor&s;t &s;chools of vice, the private anecdotes of the <HI>beau monde</HI> even in England might &s;uffice to demon&s;trate&mdash;That courte|zans are found lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of mode&s;ty and common decency, the &s;treets of London afford nightly proofs &mdash;Therefore, that ma&s;querading (which is the amu&s;e|ment of the Venetians) &s;hould cloak many crimes, and that their courtezans &s;hould be &s;hamele&s;s and their women lewd, is no &s;uch wonder, &s;eeing, as we do, tho&s;e things in this Northern clime; but we may, without any illiberality, &s;uppo&s;e, that, from phy&s;ical cau&s;es of the mo&s;t obvious kind, they are carried to a greater extent there than here: though one of the mo&s;t enlightened and amiable of all travellers &s;ays it would be hard to be proved, yet, with deference to him, I think it may be rationally &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>There is an active principle in the mind of man which will not &s;uffer it to re&s;t; it mu&s;t have &s;ome materials to work upon.

Hence that homely but true &s;aying, "Idlene&s;s is the root of all evil." In England we have a variety of expedients which the Venetians want, who&s;e minds being be&s;ides naturally more vivid, are more prompt to give a loo&s;e to the warm illu&s;ions of &s;en&s;ual fancy.

<P>PROFLIGATE though the people of Lon|don are, I will not allow that it is &s;o vicious a city as Venice. That here are in it, and indeed in all capi|tals, individuals who have reached the highe&s;t acme of &s;hamele&s;s debauchery and depravity, it would be fooli&s;h to deny: but that concubinage is practi&s;ed in the &s;ame open way, &s;o generally, or &s;o &s;y&s;tematically as at Venice, no one will venture to a&s;&s;ert. I tru&s;t the day of depravity and indelicacy is far removed from us, that will exhibit a Briti&s;h mother arranging a plan of accommodation for her &s;on, and bargaining for a young virgin to commit to his embraces&mdash;as they do in Venice&mdash;not as wife, but as concubine. On that one cu&s;tom of the Venetian ladies I re&s;t my po&s;ition; and have no he&s;itation to avow, that all the private concubinage of London amounts not to &s;uch a flagrant con&s;ummation of moral turpitude and &s;hame|le&s;s indelicacy as that practice to which I allude.</P>
<P>The Venetian men are well-featured and well-&s;ha|ped&mdash;the women, well-&s;haped, beautiful, and, it is &s;aid, witty: but I had <HI>that within</HI> which robbed every object of its charms; and I might &s;ay with HAMLET, that "man delighted not me, nor woman either."&mdash;In &s;hort, not all the beauties and novelty of the place, not all the plea&s;ures that &s;tare the tra|veller in the face, and &s;olicit his enjoyment, not all the exqui&s;ite looks of the ladies, could rou&s;e my mind from its melancholy, or fix my attention&mdash;I grew

weary of Venice before I had been many hours in it, and determined to gra&s;p at the very fir&s;t opportunity that offered for my departure.</P>
<P>I had arranged, in my own mind, a plan to proceed to Latichea, a con&s;iderable &s;ea-port town in Syria, and thence to Aleppo, whence, as it was a great Ea&s;tern mart, I entertained hopes that I &s;hould find a &s;peedy, or at lea&s;t a certain conveyance, by a cara|van, acro&s;s the de&s;erts, to Ba&s;&s;orah, and little doubted but that I &s;hould find a ve&s;&s;el at &s;ome of the Vene|tian ports, either bound, or belonging to a &s;ea-port of &s;uch commercial con&s;equence, upon which I could procure a pa&s;&s;age&mdash;But in this I was di&s;appointed; for, on the fulle&s;t inquiry that I could make, I found that there was only one &s;hip ready to &s;ail, and no probability of any other for a con&s;iderable time after &mdash;I did every thing I could to avail my&s;elf of this conveyance, but was di&s;appointed, owing to a young lady being pa&s;&s;enger, who was daughter to the owner of the ve&s;&s;el&mdash;and the old gentleman did not approve of an Engli&s;h officer being of the party with his daughter. I u&s;ed every argument without &s;ucce&s;s, urging the re&s;ident, Mr. STRANGE, who had behaved very politely to me during my &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;idence at Ve|nice, to intere&s;t him&s;elf about it: I likewi&s;e entreated Mrs. STRANGE, an affable, plea&s;ant woman, to exert her endeavours, and made her laugh, by propo&s;ing to her to give me a certificate of my behaviour, and to pledge her&s;elf to the old gentleman that the hap|pine&s;s or honour of his family would not be di&s;turbed by me during the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Hearing, however, that a &s;hip lay at Trie&s;te, which was to &s;ail thence for Alexandria in Egypt, I deter|mined to embrace that opportunity, and, in&s;tead of my former-intended route, go to Grand Cairo, thence to Suez, and &s;o down the Red Sea, by way of Mecca, to Moca, and thence to Aden, where com|pany's

ve&s;&s;els, or India country traders are always to be found going to one or other of the Briti&s;h &s;ettle|ments.</P>
<P>I accordingly &s;et out for Trie&s;te, with all the im|patience of a &s;anguine mind, anxious to change place, eager to pu&s;h forward, and full of the new route I had laid down&mdash;the charms of which, particularly of &s;ee|ing Grand Cairo, the Land of Egypt, and the Pyra|mids, were painted by my imagination in all the glow|ing exaggerated colours of romance. The captain of the ve&s;&s;el was then at Venice, and I accompanied him to Trie&s;te, which is about &s;ixty miles from Venice.</P>
<P>Soon after our arrival at Trie&s;te, I had the mor|tification to find, that the ve&s;&s;el was by no means likely to keep pace with the ardour of my mind, and that, owing to &s;ome unfore&s;een event, her departure was to be delayed; &s;o, after a few of tho&s;e effu&s;ions which may be &s;uppo&s;ed on &s;uch an occa&s;ion to e&s;cape a man of no very cool temper hanging on the tenter-hooks of expectation, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;it down, and patiently wait the revolution of time and event, which nothing could either impede or accelerate.</P>
<P>It has often been remarked, and is held as a point of faith by Prede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rians, that &s;ome men are doomed by fate to di&s;appointment&mdash;and that, when they are &s;o, no wi&s;dom can obviate, no vigilance provide again&s;t, nor no re&s;olution re&s;i&s;t, her decrees; but, that, in &s;pite of all the efforts of rea&s;on and indu&s;try, a &s;eries of &s;ini&s;ter events &s;hall pur&s;ue them through life, and meet them at every turn they attempt to take. Such has been my lot for the greate&s;t part of my life&mdash;but I have neither faith enough in prede&s;tination, nor &s;elf-love enough, &s;o far to blind me to my own faults, as to &s;uppo&s;e that lady Fate had any thing at all to do with it. No, no; it was often owing to a temper, warm, impatient, and uncontroled, which, in almo&s;t all ca&s;es of momentary embarra&s;&s;ment, cha&s;ed rea&s;on

from her office, u&s;urped her place, and decided as chance directed. Let every man examine the grounds of all his &s;erious di&s;appointments in life with candour, and he will find phy&s;ical cau&s;es to which to a&s;&s;ign them, without re&s;orting to &s;upernatural. For my part, when I hear a man &s;ay that he has been all his life pur&s;ued by ill-fortune, I directly conclude, that either he has been a blunderer, or tho&s;e he dealt with, brutes. In the ordinary operation of earthly contin|gencies, mi&s;chances will happen; but an uniform life of mi&s;chance can only ari&s;e from mi&s;management, or a very extraordinary chain of human inju&s;tice.&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections aro&s;e from the following incident:</P>
<P>I had procured a &s;ervant to attend me on my jour|ney, who, from my &s;hort ob&s;ervation of him, pro|mi&s;ed to contribute very con&s;iderably to my comfort, my convenience, and, indeed, to my &s;ecurity, as he was apparently hone&s;t, &s;incere, active, and clever in his duty, and ma&s;ter of &s;everal languages, and parti|cularly of the <HI>lingua Franca,</HI> a mixture of languages, peculiarly u&s;eful in travelling through the Ea&s;t. Find|ing that I was likely to be delayed at Trie&s;te, and conceiving that in this interim letters from England, for which I mo&s;t ardently longed, might have arrived at Venice for me, I imprudently and impetuou&s;ly &s;ent him to Venice, for the purpo&s;e of taking them up, and carrying them to me. But gue&s;s what mu&s;t have been my feelings when I found, almo&s;t immediately after his departure, that the ve&s;&s;el was preparing to &s;ail, and that I mu&s;t either lo&s;e my pa&s;&s;age or my &s;er|vant: anxious though I was to get forward, and grievous though my former delay had been to me, I he&s;itated which to do; but prudence, for once, pre|vailed over inclination; and I determined, at all events, to depart, under all the embarra&s;&s;ment attend|ing the want of a &s;ervant and lingui&s;t, and all the poignant feelings of having been acce&s;&s;ary to the di&s;|appointment,
<PB N="148" REF="031911_0144_0FEF4A3CD84E2B00">
and perhaps the injury of a poor fel|low, whom I really conceived to be a per&s;on of merit. In our pa&s;&s;age to Alexandria we touched at Zante, an i&s;land on the coa&s;t of Greece, belonging to Venice: it was anciently called Zacynthus&mdash;is about fifty miles in circumference, and contains fifty thou&s;and inhabi|tants. Never before had I ta&s;ted any thing equal to the delicious flavour of the fruits of this i&s;land&mdash;the grapes exqui&s;ite, and the melons and peaches of pro|digious bigne&s;s and unequalled flavour. The i&s;land is abundantly fruitful in wine, currants, oil, figs, and corn, but is very &s;ubject to earthquakes. Near the &s;ea-port which we entered is as great a curio&s;ity in nature as is any where, I believe, to be found, Two &s;pring wells of clear fre&s;h water throw up large pieces of real pitch, in &s;uch quantities, that, it is &s;aid, the people collect, one year with another, one hundred barrels of it, which they u&s;e in paying their &s;hipping and boats.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tages of melancholy, con&s;olation is re|jected by the mind as premature. The heart, intent, as it were, upon &s;upping full of woe, di&s;claims all ad|vances of comfort, and feeds on grief alone. Hence the truly &s;kilful in the human heart con&s;ider prema|ture con&s;olation as an aggravation of woe, and com|fort only with condolence, well knowing that the tide of grief mu&s;t take its cour&s;e, and that, until it be fir&s;t full, no hopes can be had of its retiring. The full force of this I began now to feel. The di&s;quietude of dome&s;tic embarra&s;&s;ment&mdash;the bitterne&s;s of &s;epara|tion from all I loved&mdash;the &s;olitary &s;adne&s;s of my &s;itua|tion, wandering through unknown countries&mdash;my&s;elf unknown and unfriended&mdash;aggravated at length by the lo&s;s of my &s;ervant, who was a &s;ort of prop to my &s;pirits&mdash;and my being ca&s;t into a &s;hip among a people who&s;e language I little under&s;tood, without any &s;oul or one circum&s;tance to mitigate my &s;orrow, or con&s;ole

me under it; all the&s;e, I &s;ay, had wound up my feel|ings to the highe&s;t pitch of fortune&mdash;More mi&s;erable I could not be when the i&s;land of Zante received me, and, for the fir&s;t time for a &s;ad &s;eries of days, rai&s;ed me with the tran&s;porting &s;ound of an Engli&s;h voice.</P>
<P>I have promi&s;ed, my FREDERICK, to give you a candid relation, in hopes that you will improve by it: but if I thought, that, on the contrary, any thing I &s;aid &s;hould tend to rai&s;e in your mind a &s;entiment injurious to your principles, or reflective on your fa|ther's conduct, but to be an example and admonitory guide to your own, I &s;hould condemn my candour and cur&s;e the hour that I wrote&mdash;but, I tru&s;t to your good &s;en&s;e and di&s;po&s;ition, with my care to direct them; and &s;hall, but not without he&s;itation, proceed.

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>AT the time I &s;et out upon my journey over land to India, I was (though married, and the father of children) very young, naturally of a &s;anguine con|&s;titution: my attachment to the fair &s;ex was no ways dimini&s;hed by a military education; and a warmth of temper, an ardent &s;en&s;ibility of mind, and a frank un|&s;u&s;picious di&s;po&s;ition, left me but too often to regret the facility with which I yielded to the charms of wo|men. But the regret for each error was wilfully &s;mothered in vain determinations of amendment&mdash;and
<PB N="150" REF="031911_0146_0FEF4A42DFC112F8">
the promi&s;ed amendment again broken in upon by &s;ome new error. Thus it was, till riper years and circum&s;tances of weight &s;trengthened my rea&s;on, and gave it in &s;ome greater degree that dominion it &s;hould have over my actions.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tanced as I have in my la&s;t letter de&s;cribed my|&s;elf to be, and con&s;tituted by nature and education as I have mentioned above, I landed in the charming i&s;land of Zante, where nature her&s;elf &s;eems to have con&s;pired again&s;t cha&s;tity&mdash;making the very air breathe nothing but tran&s;port and delight. There I met a young lady, a native of England&mdash;extremely pretty, highly accompli&s;hed, and captivating in the extreme: &s;he had been at Venice for her education&mdash;was a complete mi&s;tre&s;s of mu&s;ic, and expre&s;&s;ed an intention of following it profe&s;&s;ionally on her arrival in England, whither &s;he was going pa&s;&s;enger in a ve&s;&s;el bound there from Zante. To have accidentally met with a native of England, even of my own &s;ex, in &s;uch a di&s;tant corner of the world, under &s;uch circum&s;tances as mine, ju&s;t e&s;caped from the horrid life I had for &s;ome time led, mu&s;t have filled me with joy: allow|ance, therefore, may be made for my feelings on meet|ing this young lady, and for my thinking of &s;ome ex|pedient to prevent our &s;eparation. She laboured, perhaps, under the pre&s;&s;ure of feelings as di&s;agreeable as my own, and expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction at meeting with a countryman &s;o very unexpectedly. Re&s;erve was &s;oon thrown off on both &s;ides: we entered into a conver&s;ation intere&s;ting and confidential, which in|crea&s;ed my anxiety to keep her with me, and in order to per&s;uade her to accompany me, I pointed out in the &s;tronge&s;t colours po&s;&s;ible, the great advantages &s;he might derive from her accompli&s;hments in India, where her mu&s;ical talents alone, exclu&s;ive of her vari|ous captivating qualities, would be an inexhau&s;tible mine of wealth. In &s;hort, I &s;o very eagerly enforced
<PB N="151" REF="031911_0147_0FEF4A45B73F3810">
my propo&s;al to accompany me, and time was &s;o very &s;hort, that &s;he con&s;ented, and in two hours we had arranged every thing for our departure together&mdash; and here with &s;hame and &s;orrow I confe&s;s (nor &s;hall ever cea&s;e to regret it), that this ecclaireci&s;&s;ement communicated the fir&s;t ray of &s;ub&s;tantial plea&s;ure to my heart that it felt &s;ince I left London.</P>
<P>Thus far, our project &s;ailed before the wind: way|ward imagination had decked it out in the mo&s;t al|luring drapery that fancy could fabricate, and pre|vented us from &s;eeing the impracticability of it, as it &s;tood in the nakedne&s;s of truth; and when it came to be carried into execution, a thou&s;and difficulties oc|curred, that the wildne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, and the warmth of our feelings, had before concealed from our view. In the fir&s;t place, it was nece&s;&s;ary for her to obtain the con&s;ent of a lady to who&s;e care and protection &s;he was committed: in the next place, accommodations were to be procured for her in the &s;ame &s;hip with me &mdash;a circum&s;tance of mo&s;t arduous difficulty; be&s;ides which, a variety of other impediments&mdash;in&s;uperable indeed&mdash;concurred to fru&s;trate our views, and put an end to our project. If my plea&s;ure at meeting her was great, my angui&s;h at parting with her was inex|pre&s;&s;ible. I had once more to face the world alone; and, on the &s;econd day of my &s;ojourning at Zante, embarked with a heavy heart, and &s;et &s;ail for Alex|andria. The la&s;t di&s;appointments we undergo, &s;eem always the heavie&s;t; and this at Zante I thought at that time to be the greate&s;t of my life. But&mdash;oh! &s;hort-&s;ighted man! bubble of every delu&s;ive &s;hadow! I never reflected, as I have &s;ince done, what &s;erious mi&s;chiefs, what endle&s;s mi&s;ery, what lo&s;s of time, means, and reputation, I may by that providential di&s;appointment have e&s;caped&mdash;for the&s;e are the almo&s;t never-failing con&s;equences of &s;uch affairs. It too often happens, that the &s;yren who deludes a man into her
<PB N="152" REF="031911_0148_0FEF4A4881118B58">
&s;nares, is the very per&s;on who inflicts the deadly wound into his heart. Avoid, my dear FREDERICK! avoid all &s;uch, as you would avoid plague, pe&s;tilence, or ruin&mdash;&s;teel your heart by timely reflection again&s;t their advances. In all your tran&s;actions with women, like a good general in warfare, &s;ecure for your heart a retreat; for it will be too late to find that they are unworthy when your heart is en&s;nared&mdash;and when you find them worthy of your affection, it will be time enough to give a loo&s;e to the &s;en&s;ibility of your heart. A virtuous woman is beyond all calculation to be valued, when &s;he is found; but, alas! in find|ing her, you may pa&s;s through &s;o many fires ordeal, and run &s;uch danger, that it is almo&s;t a doubt, whe|ther a wi&s;e man (if he can fetter his pa&s;&s;ions) had not better di&s;pen&s;e with the ble&s;&s;ing, than run the hazard of &s;earching for it.</P>
<P>On my arrival at Alexandria, I found, to my fre&s;h mortification, that the plague was raging all over Egypt&mdash;and as, if this was not of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to block up my intended route, an irruption of the Arabs, who in formidable bodies infe&s;ted all the roads, put a period to all my hopes of &s;eeing Grand Cairo, and viewing the curio&s;ities of that country, which all who, like us, have the Bible put early into their hands, are taught to venerate as &s;oon as they are taught to read. Here I thought to have viewed the pyramids, who&s;e antiquity, origin, or intended u&s;e, have baffled the learned and ingenious inquiries of &s;o many ages&mdash;of beholding Mount Sinai, the &s;tone of Mo&s;es, the track of the I&s;raelites, all of which are &s;aid to be clearly pointed out, and geography by that means brought into the &s;upport of Sacred Hi&s;tory. The&s;e, and many things, I did wi&s;h to &s;ee&mdash;they are worth it: but I have had &s;ince rea&s;on to believe, that my ill luck was not &s;o great as I then thought it; for the &s;earch is dangerous, and made prodigiou&s;ly ex|pen&s;ive

<P>Alexandria was built by ALEXANDER the Great, &s;oon after the overthrow of Tyre, about 333 years before CHRIST, and is &s;ituated on the Mediterranean, twelve miles we&s;t of that mouth of the Nile, anciently called Canopicum. A very extraordinary circum&s;tance is related as a proof of the &s;uddenne&s;s of ALEXAN|DER's re&s;olution to build it: After he had directed the number of public &s;tructures, and fixed the places where they were to &s;tand, there were no in&s;truments at hand proper for marking out the walls, according to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e times: upon this, a workman advi&s;ed the King to collect what meal was among the &s;oldiers, and &s;ift it in lines upon the ground, in order to mark out the circuit of the walls: the advice was followed, and the king's &s;ooth&s;ayer interpreted it to be a pre&s;age of the future pro&s;perity and abundance of the city. This pro|phecy was certainly afterwards verified; for it &s;oon be|came the emporium of commerce, of arts, and of &s;ciences.</P>
<P>By the de&s;cription of STRABO and other ancients, it appears that this city was built upon a plan well worthy the va&s;t mind o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its founder; and the frag|ments of its ornaments afterwards compo&s;ed a part of the grande&s;t embelli&s;hments of Rome and Con&s;tan|tinople. In the mu&s;eum of the royal palace, which occupied a fourth part of the city, the body of ALEX|ANDER was depo&s;ited in a golden coffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;but the dete&s;table SELEUCUS CIBYOFACTES violated the mo|nument, took away the golden coffin, and &s;ub&s;tituted a gla&s;s one in its place.</P>
<P>This city like mo&s;t others of antiquity, has been the &s;cene of terrible ma&s;&s;acres. About two hundred years after its foundation, it was totally depopulated

by PTOLEMY PHYSCON&mdash;the very few who e&s;caped &s;laughter, flying into other countries. De&s;irous, however, not to reign over empty hou&s;es, he &s;educed inhabitants from the neighbouring countries; and again, for &s;ome &s;light offence, determined on a general ma&s;&s;acre of the young men; and accordingly, when they were one day a&s;&s;embled in the Gymna&s;ium, or place of pub|lic exerci&s;e, he ordered it to be &s;et on fire, &s;o that all peri&s;hed, either in the flames, or by the &s;words of his mercenaries, whom he had placed at all the avenues. Afterwards, in the year of CHRIST 215, the Emperor CARACALLA, having been lampooned by &s;ome of the inhabitants, ordered a general ma&s;&s;acre by his numerous troops, who were di&s;per&s;ed over the city. The inhuman orders being given, all were murdered, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex; &s;o that, in one night's time, the whole city floated in blood, and every hou&s;e was filled with carca&s;es: the mon&s;ter him&s;elf, retiring to the temple of Serapis, was all the time imploring the protection of the Deity&mdash;a proof that practical devotion and the mo&s;t atrocious inhu|manity may meet in the &s;ame bo&s;om. As if this had not been &s;ufficient vengeance, he &s;tripped the city of all its ancient privileges&mdash;ordered all &s;trangers who lived there to depart&mdash;and, that the few who re|mained might not have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing one another, he cut off all communication of one &s;treet with another, by walls built for the purpo&s;e, and guarded with troops.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ma&s;&s;acres, Alexandria again recovered its former &s;plendour&mdash;and was again &s;acked by AMROU, the infamous Saracen&mdash;and all the intre|pid youth of the city peri&s;hed with arms in their hands. The magnificence of the city may be e&s;timated from the account written by AMROU to the Caliph: "I have taken," &s;aid he, "the City of the We&s;t; it is of an immen&s;e extent; I cannot de&s;cribe to you how

<P>The great advantages of the Ea&s;t India trade, which was then carried on by-the Red Sea, pre&s;erved Alexandria through &s;everal revolutions; but having fallen under the dominion of the Turks, and the pa&s;&s;age round the Cape of Good Hope being di&s;|covered, a fatal blow was given to its commerce, and it has &s;ince fallen to decay. It is, however, even now, worth the attention of the cla&s;&s;ical traveller. Entering the harbour, we pa&s;&s;ed by the I&s;land of Pharos, were PTOLEMY built the enormous tower which was once the wonder of the world; and, when riding within the port, nothing could be more gratify|ing than to &s;ee from thence that mixture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncient and modern monuments that pre&s;ented them&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to the view, on which ever &s;ide the eye could be turned.</P>
<P>Of myriads of antiquities which this place affords for the in&s;pection of the curious, I &s;hall mention only two&mdash;One, the column of POMPEY, on viewing of which, the remembrance of that great and good man's mo&s;t unmerited and cruel fate extracted a &s;igh from the bottom of my heart: this pillar engages the at|tention of all travellers; it is compo&s;ed of red granite; the capital is Corinthian, with palm leaves, and not indented; the &s;haft and the upper member of the ba&s;e are of one piece, ninety feet long; and nine in diameter; the ba&s;e, a &s;quare of fifteen feet on each &s;ide; the whole column is one hundred and fourteen feet high, perfectly well poli&s;hed, and only a little &s;hivered on the ea&s;tern &s;ide. Nothing can equal the maje&s;ty of this monument: &s;een from a di&s;tance, it overtops the town, and &s;erves as a &s;ignal for ve&s;&s;els; approaching it nearer, it produces an a&s;toni&s;hment mixed with awe: one would never be tired of ad|miring the beauty of the capital, the length of the &s;haft, nor the extraordinary &s;implicity of the pede&s;tal.

Some years ago, a party of Engli&s;h &s;eamen contrived, by flying a kite, to draw a line over the pillar, and by that means made a kind of a &s;hroud, by which they got up, and on the very top of it drank a bowl of punch, to the utter a&s;toni&s;hment of a multitude who came to &s;ee them; they broke off one of the volutes of the column, but amply compen&s;ated for this mi&s;chief by a di&s;covery they made, as, without their evidence, the world would not have known, at this hour, that there was originally a &s;tatue on this column, one foot and ancle of which, of enormous &s;ize, are &s;till remaining.&mdash; The other is the obeli&s;k of CLEOPATRA, of immen&s;e &s;ize, and of one &s;ingle piece of granite marble. Here I ob&s;erved, too, a thick wall, with towers mouldering under extreme age, which contained, in its face, frag|ments of architecture of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman|&s;hip, &s;uch as broken columns, friezes, &amp;c.; tho&s;e were the antique ruins of &s;ome fallen pieces of antiquity, at the time that this antique wall was built: what, then, mu&s;t be the length of time &s;ince they had fir&s;t undergone the hands of the workman? The&s;e circum|&s;tances tend to demon&s;trate, that, far back beyond the reach of our calculation, the arts flouri&s;hed: and when one thinks of the miraculous ma&s;&s;es of work done in former ages&mdash;the magnitude of the pieces of which tho&s;e works were compo&s;ed, &s;uch as whole columns and obeli&s;ks of a &s;ingle block of marble&mdash; the Colo&s;&s;us of Rhodes, made of bra&s;s, one foot of which was placed on one &s;ide of the harbour, and another on the other &s;ide, &s;o that &s;hips pa&s;&s;ed between its legs&mdash;we cannot help yielding up the palm to the ancients for &s;tupendous magnificence, however we may &s;urpa&s;s them for the u&s;eful, the elegant, and the good.</P>

I accordingly arrived at Cyprus in perfect, &s;afety, where, to my great &s;orrow and a&s;toni&s;hment, I found that an epidemical fever, equal in its effects to a plague, prevailed: however, there was no alternative; I mo&s;t run the ri&s;que, and I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the boat that carried me from Alexandria.</P>
<P>Although the etymologies of the names of places are of very little importance, and mo&s;t frequently uncertain, I think it probable that the learned are right, who a&s;&s;ert the name of this is derived from <GAP DESC="foreign">
(Cyprus) or Cypre&s;s&mdash;with which &s;hrubs the i&s;land abounds. It had, in ancient times, a number of other names&mdash;one of which was Paphia, whence Venus, who was wor&s;hipped in it, was called the Paphian God|de&s;s. It lies thirty miles we&s;t of Syria, whither I was bound, &s;tretching from the &s;outh-we&s;t to the north-ea&s;t, one hundred and fifty miles in length, and &s;eventy in breadth in the wide&s;t part of it.</P>
<P>This i&s;land holds a very high rank in cla&s;&s;ic lore&mdash;It gave birth to &s;ome great philo&s;ophers and con&s;iderable poets&mdash;The Apo&s;tle BARNABAS was a native of it, and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by ST. PAUL, fir&s;t intro|duced Chri&s;tianity among them. Famagu&s;ta, a town on the ea&s;tern part of the i&s;land, oppo&s;ite to the &s;hore of Syria, is the ancient Salamis, built by TEUCER the &s;on of TELAMON, and brother of AJAX.</P>

de&s;potically governed than tho&s;e nearer the &s;ource of redre&s;s, Cyprus has been continually ruled with a rod of iron &s;ince it came into the heads of the Turks. While it was under the dominion of Chri&s;tians, it was well-peopled, having no le&s;s than eight hundred or a thou&s;and villages in it, be&s;ides &s;everal hand&s;ome cities; but the Turks have &s;pread ruin and de&s;olation over the country, and it is now &s;o thinly inhabited that more than half the lands lie uncultivated.</P>
<P>The air of this i&s;land is now for the mo&s;t part un|whole&s;ome, owing to the damps ari&s;ing from the many fens and mar&s;hes with which the country abounds&mdash;while, there being but few &s;prings or rivers in the i&s;land, the want of a plentiful fall of rain, at proper periods, di&s;tre&s;&s;es the inhabitants very much in another way; and by means of the uncultivated &s;tate of the country, they are greatly infe&s;ted with poi&s;onous reptiles of various kinds.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable mountain in Cyprus is called Olympus&mdash;a name common to &s;everal other mountains in Greece, particularly to that in The&s;&s;aly, &s;o famous in the poetry of the ancients. That in Cyprus is about fifty miles in circumference: great part of it is covered with woods; and at the foot of it are fine vineyards, which produce admirable wine, not only in a &s;ufficiency for their own con&s;umption, but &s;ome al&s;o for exportation&mdash;And although the greater part of the i&s;land lies uncultivated, as I have before ob|&s;erved, it produces a &s;ufficient quantity of corn, unle&s;s in &s;ea&s;ons when their harve&s;t fails, in which ca&s;e the people are ea&s;ily &s;upplied from the continent. They have, be&s;ides, cattle enough for their own con&s;ump|tion&mdash;Many parts of the country abound with wild|fowl, and &s;everal &s;orts of game, and they have plenty of fi&s;h upon the &s;ea coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The trade of Cyprus is not incon&s;iderable, and carried on chiefly by Jews and Armenians: the com|modities
<PB N="159" REF="031911_0155_0FEF4A5B5A0B5BC0">
in which they deal are wine, oil, cotton, wool, &s;alt, &s;ilk, and turpentine&mdash;be&s;ides, it produces &s;everal &s;orts of earth, fit for the u&s;e of painters, par|ticularly red, black, and yellow.</P>
<P>Its mo&s;t wonderful production, however, is the fa|mous &s;tone <GAP DESC="foreign">
(A&s;be&s;tos) inextingui&s;hable, or <GAP DESC="foreign">
(Amiantos) impollutus, &s;o called from its ex|traordinary property of re&s;i&s;ting fire. It is related that the ancients made out of this &s;tone a kind of thread that would remain uncon&s;umed in the mo&s;t in|ten&s;e fire. It is even &s;aid, that &s;ome experiments have been made in modern days, which have &s;uffici|ently proved that the thing is not a fiction. In &s;uch extraordinary que&s;tions as this, though I do not po&s;i|tively contradict, I always &s;u&s;pend my belief, till &s;ome|thing &s;tronger than mere a&s;&s;ertion is offered to con|vince me.</P>
<P>There is one dreadful mi&s;chief to which this i&s;land is &s;ubject&mdash;In the hot &s;ea&s;on, locu&s;ts come from the Continent, in &s;warms &s;o va&s;t and &s;o thick as to darken the &s;ky like clouds. Tho&s;e would certainly devour all the fruits of the earth, if they were not driven to &s;ea by a north wind that u&s;ually blows at the time of their coming. When that wind happens to fail, which fortunately is &s;eldom, the con&s;equence is a total demo|lition of the fruits of the country.</P>
<P>The whole i&s;land, as well as particular towns, was entirely con&s;ecrated to the godde&s;s VENUS, who thence was called VENUS CYPRIA, or DEA CYPRIA, and is repre&s;ented by the poets as taking a peculiar plea&s;ure in vi&s;iting it&mdash;and this unque&s;tionably aro&s;e from the loo&s;e habits and la&s;civious temperament of the women there, who certainly are, at this time, not remarkable for cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, however, that I felt great plea&s;ure in entering Cyprus&mdash;it was, as I have already &s;tated, cla&s;&s;ic ground, and dedicated to the Queen of Love.

Thus, in the extraordinary revolutions that human affairs are ince&s;&s;antly undergoing, that i&s;land which for its &s;uperior beauties was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the re&s;idence of love, which gave birth to the phi|lo&s;ophers ZENO, APPOLLONIUS, and XENOPHON, is now a mi&s;erable, half-cultivated &s;pot, peopled with a mixture of wretched Turks, Jews, Greeks, and Chri&s;|tians&mdash;groaning under the tyranny of a barbarous de&s;potic abu&s;e of delegated power&mdash;infe&s;ted with lo|cu&s;ts which devour the fruits of the earth&mdash;and di&s;|graced by a race of ignominious women, who e&s;teem it to be an act of religion to pro&s;titute them&s;elves to all &s;trangers.</P>
<P>Our RICHARD the Fir&s;t made a conque&s;t of this i&s;land on his way to the Holy Land, and conferred the royalty of it on GUY LUSIGNAN, king of Jeru&s;a|lem.

<P>Continuing my route, I hired another boat, after only forty-eight hours &s;tay at Cyprus, and proceeded for Latichea, which, as I have &s;omewhere before mentioned, is a con&s;iderable &s;ea-port town of Syria, built on a promontory of land, which, running into the &s;ea, occa&s;ions its being continually refre&s;hed with breezes. Fortune, who had hitherto been not very liberal in her di&s;pen&s;ations, now favoured me; for,

ju&s;t as I arrived at Latichea, a ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n was preparing. The con&s;ul of the Turki&s;h Company at Cyprus re|ceived me with great politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality&mdash;gave me a letter to the re&s;ident at Latichea; and by his in&s;truction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, after a very &s;hort &s;tay, I &s;et out on my way to Aleppo with the caravan.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion more particularly to de&s;cribe the nature of tho&s;e caravans, I &s;hall, for the pre&s;ent, tell you, that this was compo&s;ed of no other bea&s;ts of burden than mules and a&s;&s;es, of which there were not le&s;s than three or four hundred in number.</P>
<P>Mounted on a mule, I travelled along, well plea&s;ed with the fertile appearance of the country, and de|lighted with the &s;erenity of the air&mdash;We were, as well as I can now recollect, near ten days on the road; during which time we travelled only in the morning early, and in the heat of the day repo&s;ed under the &s;hade of trees.</P>
<P>I was informed, that if, in&s;tead of going to Lati|chea, I had gone to Scandaroon (otherwi&s;e Alexan|dretta), I &s;hould, in the road from thence to Aleppo, have travelled through a country, in which the mo&s;t &s;ingular and extravagant cu&s;toms prevail that exi&s;t in any country emerged from barbari&s;m&mdash;Several of tho&s;e I heard; but one in particular was, that the men pro&s;tituted their wives and daughters to all comers&mdash;and that this originated from a principle of religion, though there was every rea&s;on to believe, that, like many of their religious in&s;titutions, it was at la&s;t made &s;ub&s;ervient to the gratification of avarice.</P>
<P>On my way to Aleppo, I was met by a Mr. &mdash;, an Engli&s;h gentleman, who had heard of my coming, and who, in the mo&s;t kind and ho&s;pitable manner, in|&s;i&s;ted upon my living at his hou&s;e in&s;tead of the Bri|ti&s;h con&s;ul's, where I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have re&s;ided during my &s;tay there; and his manner of a&s;king me

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FREDERICK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SO long as the route of my journey lay through European regions, little pre&s;ented it&s;elf re|&s;pecting human nature of &s;uch very great novelty as to excite admiration or awaken curio&s;ity. In all the various nations through which we have pa&s;&s;ed, a cer|tain parity of &s;entiment, ari&s;ing from the one great &s;ub&s;tratum, Chri&s;tianity, gave the &s;ame general co|louring to all the &s;cenes, however they might differ from each other in their various &s;hadings. Whatever di&s;&s;imilitude the influence of accident, climate, or lo|cal circum&s;tance, may, in the revolutions of ages, have introduced into their manners, cu&s;toms, municipal laws, and exterior forms of wor&s;hip&mdash;the great code of religion and moral &s;entiment remains nearly the &s;ame with all: and right and wrong, good and evil, being defined by the &s;ame principles of rea&s;on, and a&s;certained by the &s;ame boundaries, bring the rule of conduct of each to &s;o clo&s;e an approximation with that of the others, that, when compared with tho&s;e
<PB N="164" REF="031911_0160_0FEF4A67319E2218">
we are now to attend to, they may really be con&s;i|dered as one and the &s;ame people.</P>
<P>In the empire now before us, were we to leave our judgment to the guidance of general opinion of Chri&s;|tian nations, we &s;hould have, on the contrary, to con|template man under a variety of forms and modifica|tions, &s;o entirely different from tho&s;e to which habit has familiari&s;ed our minds, as at fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o impre&s;s us with the idea of a total di&s;ruption from our nature, and induce us, as it has already the generality of our people, to divorce them from a participation of all tho&s;e &s;ympathetic feelings which &s;erve to inforce the di&s;charge of mutual good offices among men. Dedu|cing all their principles, not only of moral conduct, but municipal government, from a religion radically different from, and e&s;&s;entially adver&s;e to, ours; de|luded by that &s;y&s;tem into a variety of opinions which liberality it&s;elf mu&s;t think ab&s;urd; unaided by that enlightened philo&s;ophy which learning, and learned men, acting under the influence of comparative free|dom, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the art of printing, have diffu&s;ed through the ma&s;s of Europeans; and living under a climate the mo&s;t unfavourable to intellectual or bodily exertion, they exhibit a &s;pectacle which the philo&s;o|phic and liberal mind mu&s;t view with di&s;approbation, regret, and pity&mdash;the illiberal fierce Chri&s;tian with unqualified dete&s;tation and di&s;gu&s;t: while, on their part, bigoted to their own principles and opinions, they look on us with abhorrence, and indulge as con|&s;cientious a contempt of, and antipathy to Chri&s;tians, which I apprehend no lap&s;e of time, without a great change of circum&s;tance, will be able to eradicate. Should Mahomedani&s;m and Chri&s;tianity ever happen to merge in Dei&s;m (but not otherwi&s;e), the inhabi|tants of Syria and Europe will agree to con&s;ider each other even as fellow-creatures. In Spain and Portu|gal, Jew, Turk, and indeed Prote&s;tant, are without

di&s;tinction called hogs. In Turkey, Jews and Chri&s;|tians are indi&s;criminately called dogs; each thinking the other completely excluded from the pale of huma|nity, and well worthy the dagger of any TRUE BE|LIEVER who would have the <HI>piety</HI> to apply it.</P>
<P>You will allow, my dear FREDERICK, that it mu&s;t have been rather an important contemplation to your father, to have perhaps two thou&s;and miles to travel through the immen&s;e and almo&s;t trackle&s;s wilds of a country inhabited by &s;uch people, without the con&s;o|lation of any others to accompany him in his journey; for, unle&s;s a public di&s;patch was to overtake me, there was little probability of my having a &s;ingle Eu|ropean partner of my fatigue and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ils.</P>
<P>However, as the period was not yet arrived at which I was to go forward, or even determine my mode of travelling, I endeavoured to &s;oothe my mind as much as I could into content, and to take advan|tage of my &s;tay at Aleppo, to acquire all the know|ledge po&s;&s;ible of the place, that is to &s;ay, of that city in particular, and of the Turki&s;h government and manners in general.</P>
<P>A di&s;tant view of Aleppo fills the mind with expec|tations of great &s;plendour and magnificence. The mo&s;ques, the towers, the large ranges of hou&s;es with flat roofs, ri&s;ing above each other, according to the &s;loping hills on which they &s;tand, the whole variegated with beautiful rows of trees, form altogether a &s;cene magnificent, gay, and delightful: but, on entering the town, all tho&s;e expected beauties vani&s;h, and leave nothing in the &s;treets to meet the eye, but a di&s;mal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of high &s;tone walls, gloomy as the rece&s;&s;es of a convent or &s;tate pri&s;on, and unenlivened by win|dows, embelli&s;hed, as with us, by the human face divine. The &s;treets them&s;elves, not wider than &s;ome of the meane&s;t alleys in London, overca&s;t by the height of the pri&s;on-hou&s;es on either &s;ide, are ren|dered
<PB N="166" REF="031911_0162_0FEF4A6C974B7C58">
&s;till more formidably gloomy by the &s;olitude and &s;ilence that pervade them; while here and there a lattice towards the top, barely vi&s;ible, &s;trikes the &s;oul with the gloomy idea of thraldom, coercion, and im|pri&s;onment.</P>
<P>This dete&s;table mode of building, which owes its origin to jealou&s;y, and the &s;candalous re&s;traints every man is empowered by the laws and religion of the place to impo&s;e upon the women con&s;igned either by &s;ale or birth to his tyranny, extends not to the in&s;ide of the hou&s;es, many of which are magnificent and hand&s;ome, and all admirably &s;uited to the exigencies of the climate, and the dome&s;tic cu&s;toms and manner of living of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The city is adorned, it is true, here and there, with mo&s;ques and appendant towers, called Minarets, from which cryers call the faithful to prayers; and in &s;ome of the &s;treets there are arches built at certain di&s;tances from each other, &s;o as to carry the eye directly through them, and form a vi&s;ta of con&s;iderable grandeur: but all the&s;e are far from &s;ufficient to coun|terbalance the general a&s;pect of gloomine&s;s and &s;oli|tude which reigns, over the whole, and renders it &s;o peculiarly di&s;gu&s;ting, particularly at fir&s;t &s;ight, to an Engli&s;hman who has enjoyed the gaiety and contem|plated the freedom of a city in Great Britain.</P>
<P>The mo&s;ques (Mahomedan temples) are extremely numerous in this city; indeed almo&s;t as much &s;o as churches and convents in the Popi&s;h countries of Chri&s;tendom, There is nothing in their external ap|pearance to attract the notice of the traveller, or in|dulge the eye of the architect; they are almo&s;t all of one form&mdash;an oblong quadrangle: and as to the in&s;ide, I never had an opportunity of &s;eeing one; none but Mu&s;&s;ulmen being permitted to enter them, at lea&s;t at Aleppo.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="031911_0163_0FEF4A6E2527FA68">The next buildings of a public kind to the mo&s;ques that de&s;erve to be particularly mentioned, are the caravan&s;eras&mdash;buildings which, whether we con&s;ider the &s;pirit of beneficence and charity that fir&s;t &s;ug|ge&s;ted them, their national importance, or their exten|&s;ive utility, may rank, though not in &s;plendour of appearance, at lea&s;t in true value, with any to be found in the world.</P>
<P>Caravan&s;eras were originally intended for, and are now pretty generally applied to, the accommodation of &s;trangers and travellers, though, like every other good in&s;titution, &s;ometimes perverted to the purpo&s;es of private emolument or public job: they are built at proper di&s;tances through the roads of the Turki&s;h dominions, and afford the indigent or weary traveller an a&s;ylum from the inclemency of the weather; are in general very large, and built of the mo&s;t &s;olid and durable materials; have commonly one &s;tory above the ground floor, the lower of which is arched, and &s;erves for warehou&s;es to &s;tow goods, for lodgings and for &s;tables, while the upper is u&s;ed merely for lodgings; be&s;ides which, they are always accommodated with a fountain, and have cooks &s;hops and other con|veniencies to &s;upply the wants of the lodgers. In Aleppo the Caravan&s;eras are almo&s;t exclu&s;ively occu|pied by merchants, to whom they are, like other hou&s;es, rented.</P>
<P>The &s;uburbs of Aleppo, and the &s;urrounding coun|try, are very hand&s;ome, plea&s;ant, and, to a per&s;on coming out of the gloomy city, in &s;ome re&s;pects intere&s;ting. Some to&s;&s;ed about into hill and valley lie under the hands of the hu&s;bandman; others are covered with hand&s;ome villas; and others again laid out in gardens, whither the people of Aleppo occa|&s;ionally re&s;ort for amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The roofs of all the hou&s;es are flat, and formed of a compo&s;ition which re&s;i&s;ts the weather effectually. On

tho&s;e mo&s;t of the people &s;leep in the very hot weather: they are &s;eparated from each other by walls; but the Franks, who live contiguous to one another, and who, from their di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances with regard to the Turks, are under the nece&s;&s;ity of keep|ing up a friendly and harmonious intercour&s;e to|gether, have doors of communication, which are attended with the&s;e fortunate and plea&s;ing advantages, that they can make a large circuit without de&s;cending into the &s;treets, and can vi&s;it each other during the plague, without running the ri&s;k of catching the in|fection by going among the natives below.</P>
<P>There is a ca&s;tle in the city which I had nearly forgotten to mention&mdash;The natives conceive it to be a place of great &s;trength. It could not, however with|&s;tand the &s;hock of a few pieces of ordnance for a day. It is e&s;teemed a favour to be permitted to &s;ee it; and there is nothing to recompen&s;e one for the trouble of obtaining permi&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s it be the pro&s;pect of the &s;urrounding country, which from the battlements is exten&s;ive and beautiful.</P>
<P>Near this ca&s;tle &s;tands the &s;eraglio, a large old building, where the ba&s;haw of Aleppo re&s;ides: the whole of it &s;eemed to me to be kept in very bad repair, con&s;idering the importance of the place. It is &s;ur|rounded by a &s;trong wall of great height; be&s;ides which, its contiguity to the ca&s;tle is very conveni|ent; as, in ca&s;e of popular tumults, or inte&s;tine com|motions, the ba&s;haw finds an a&s;ylum in the latter, which commmands and overawes the city, and is never without a numerous garri&s;on under the command of an Aga.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ummary account I have been able to collect of Aleppo, the capital of Syria; which, mean though it is when compared with the capitals of Euro|pean countries, is certainly the third city for &s;plendour, magnificence, and importance, in the va&s;t extent of

<P>HOWEVER faction may agitate, or abu&s;e irritate the minds of men again&s;t the executive branch of their government, the people of every nation under Heaven are di&s;po&s;ed to think their own con&s;titutional &s;y&s;tem the be&s;t; and the artful intertexture of reli|gion with governments confirms them in that opi|nion, and often con&s;igns the under&s;tanding to unal|terable error and illiberal prejudice. It would be wonderful, then, if the Turki&s;h con&s;titution, founded on the Koran, was not looked upon with abhorrence by the bulk of the Chri&s;tian world; and more wonderful &s;till, if the outrageous zealots of the Chri&s;|tian church, who for &s;o many centuries engro&s;&s;ed all the learning of Europe to them&s;elves, &s;hould not have handed down with exaggerated mi&s;repre&s;entation every circum&s;tance belonging to the great enemies of their faith. But that, at this day of intellectual illumina|tion, mankind &s;hould be enveloped in &s;uch error and darkne&s;s, with regard to the government of &s;o large a portion of the globe as Turkey, is extraordinary; and only to be accounted for by a reference, in the fir&s;t place, to tho&s;e religious prejudices which we &s;uck in from our nur&s;e, and which habit, ince&s;&s;ant document, and every part of our education, tend to confirm in our mind; and in the next, to that indi&s;|po&s;ition
<PB N="170" REF="031911_0166_0FEF4A76604231A8">
the human mind feels to part with its old prejudices, and the general indolence and incapacity of men to acquire knowledge by the arduous and fatiguing paths of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h government is gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented. Were our opinions to be directed by the general belief of Europeans, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the life and property of every being in that va&s;t empire were irremediably at the mercy of the Grand Seignior&mdash; and that, without laws to protect, or any inter|mediate power whatever to &s;hield them, they were entirely &s;ubject to the capricious will of an inexorable tyrant, who, &s;timulated by cruelty, &s;harpened by avarice, and unre&s;trained by any law human or divine, did every thing to oppre&s;s his &s;ubjects, and carry de|&s;truction among mankind. I firmly believe, that, from the combination of ideas ari&s;ing from tho&s;e prejudices, there are few Chri&s;tians who think or hear of the grand Turk, that do not, by an involuntary act of the mind, in&s;tantly think of blood and murder, &s;trangling with bow&s;trings, and &s;licing off heads with cimeters.</P>
<P>As there is no part of your education more near my heart than the eradicating illiberal prejudices from your mind, and fortifying you again&s;t their a&s;&s;aults; I find it impo&s;&s;ible to refrain from giving you my opinion of the Turki&s;h government, which I have been at &s;ome pains to collect, as well from oral information as from the be&s;t authors; and which, though very far from what a generous and univer&s;ally philanthropic di&s;po&s;ition would wi&s;h them to have, is very different from that which is generally attributed to them, and unque&s;tionably far more limited in its powers than the governments of &s;everal Chri&s;tian countries I could mention.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of that country is laid down ex|pre&s;sly in the Koran. The emperor of Turkey (com|monly called the Grand Seignior) is a de&s;cendant of
<PB N="171" REF="031911_0167_0FEF4A792A053F78">
Mahomet, who pretended he had the Koran from Heaven: and he is as much bound by the in&s;titutes of that book as any &s;ubject in his realm&mdash;as liable to depo&s;ition as they to puni&s;hment for breach of them, and indeed has been more than once depo&s;ed, and the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion rai&s;ed to the throne. Thus far, it is obvious, his power is limited and under control. But that is not all&mdash;It is equally certain that the Turki&s;h government is partly republican; for, though the people at large have no &s;hare in the legi&s;lation, and are excluded by the Koran from it (which Koran has e&s;tabli&s;hed and preci&s;ely a&s;certained their rights, privileges, and per&s;onal &s;ecurity), yet there is an intermediate power which, when rou&s;ed to exer|tion, is &s;tronger than the Emperor's, and &s;tands as a bulwark between the extremes of De&s;poti&s;m and them. This body is THE ULAMA, compo&s;ed of all the members of the Church and the law, &s;uperior to any nobility, jealous of their rights and privileges, and partly taken from the people, not by election, but by profe&s;&s;ion and talents.&mdash;In this body are compri&s;ed the Moulahs, the hereditary and perpetual guardians of the religion and laws of the empire: they derive their authority as much as the Emperor from the Koran, and, when nece&s;&s;ary, act with all the firm|ne&s;s re&s;ulting from a conviction of that authority; which they often demon&s;trate by oppo&s;ing his mea|&s;ures, not only with impunity, but &s;ucce&s;s. Their per&s;ons are &s;acred; and they can, by means of the unbounded re&s;pect in which they are held, rou&s;e the people to arms, and proceed to depo&s;e. But, what is much more, the Emperor cannot be depo&s;ed without their concurrence.</P>
<P>If, by this provi&s;ion of the con&s;titution, the power or the monarch is limited, and the per&s;onal &s;ecurity of the &s;ubject a&s;certained, on the one hand; the energy of the empire in its external operations is,
<PB N="172" REF="031911_0168_0FEF4A7AB6057BA8">
on the other, very frequently and fatally pal&s;ied by it. Declarations of war have been procra&s;tinated, till an injurious and irrecoverable act of ho&s;tility has been &s;u&s;tained; and peace often protracted, when peace would have been advantageous. The Ulama being a numerous body, it has been found always difficult, often impo&s;&s;ible, to unite &s;o many different opinions; and nothing being to be done without their concurrence, the executive power finds it often impo&s;&s;ible to take a deci&s;ive &s;tep in a cri&s;is of advantageous opportunity. But as this code of laws and government is received as a divine revela|tion, binding both prince and people, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ealed in Heaven, the breach of it would be &s;uf|ficient to con&s;ign even the monarch to depo&s;ition and death.</P>
<P>As to the military force, which in the hands of all De&s;pots has been made the in&s;trument of the people's &s;lavery, that of the Turk could avail him nothing; and, whenever it does interfere, acts only to his over|throw. The very reverence they have for his per&s;on ari&s;ing from obedience to their religion, they are, <HI>&agrave; fortiori,</HI> governed by it, not him. He holds no communication with them; and the &s;tanding force of the Jani&s;&s;aries is, compared with the ma&s;s of the people, only a handful. Some wild accounts, indeed, have &s;tated it at 300,000; but the be&s;t informed fix it below 60,000, of which a great part con&s;i&s;ts of fal&s;e mu&s;ters and abu&s;es&mdash;great multitudes being en|rolled to obtain certain privileges annexed to the office of Jani&s;&s;ary. The fact is, that the chief force of the empire is a militia compo&s;ed of the people; who, with re&s;pect to obedience and &s;ubordination, are &s;o loo&s;e that they leave their duty whenever they plea&s;e, without receiving any puni&s;hment. How far the people of Turkey are protected from the encroach|ments of power, will appear from the recital of a fact
<PB N="173" REF="031911_0169_0FEF4A7EE3CA6250">
related by one of the be&s;t: and mo&s;t liberal of our hi&s;torians on that &s;ubject, and which is of too great notoriety to be doubted.</P>
<P>In the year 1755, the Porte, as it is called, or Palace of the Grand Vizir at Con&s;tantinople, was burnt down: in laying the plan for rebuilding it on the former &s;ite, the leading con&s;ideration was, how to contrive matters &s;o as to render it &s;ecure from acci|dents of a like nature in future; and it was deter|mined that the only certain means to do &s;o was, to leave a &s;pace of clear ground all round it, for which purpo&s;e the contiguous hou&s;es &s;hould be purcha&s;ed from the proprietors, and demoli&s;hed. All the owners of the hou&s;es agreed to the &s;ale, except one old wo|man, who pertinaciou&s;ly refu&s;ed: &s;he &s;aid &s;he was born, and had lived all her life, in that &s;pot, and would not quit it for any one. Now, in England, for the convenience of a private canal, the Parliament would force her to &s;ell. But what did they &s;ay in Turkey? When all the people cried out, "Why does not the Sultan u&s;e his authority, and take the hou&s;e, and pay her the value?" No! an&s;wered the magi&s;|trates and the Ulama, it is impo&s;&s;ible! it cannot be done! it is her property. While the power of the monarch is thus limited, and the rights of the people thus a&s;certained by the Koran, and in things manife&s;t and open to view rigidly adhered to, ju&s;tice between man and man is rarely admini&s;tered; for, though the laws them&s;elves are good, the corrupt admini&s;tration of them di&s;arms their effect, and di&s;torts them from their purpo&s;e. The venality of the judges is beyond conception flagitious and barefaced; and their conni|vances at fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly habitual, that te&s;timony is become an article of commerce, and can be procured with a facility and at a price that at once &s;tamps an opprobrium on the country, and furni&s;hes matter of wonder to the con&s;iderate mind, how, if
<PB N="174" REF="031911_0170_0FEF4A80709535C8">
judges are flagitious and &s;hamele&s;s enough to be guilty of it, the people can bear &s;uch a pernicious &s;y&s;tem &s;o long. Hence flow all the cen&s;ures on the laws and government of that country&mdash;hence mo&s;t of the impe|diments under which its commerce and agriculture langui&s;h; while the actual written laws of the realm are, if duly admini&s;tered, &s;ufficiently adequate to the &s;ecurity of property, the regulation of commerce, the repre&s;&s;ion of vice, and the puni&s;hment and prevention of crimes.</P>
<P>In endeavouring to guard your mind again&s;t an illi|beral, vulgar prejudice, I have &s;tated to you what the Turki&s;h con&s;titution is, and what the laws; but you mu&s;t not carry what I have &s;aid to an over|&s;trained or forced interpretation. I would not have you infer that the people are well governed; I only &s;ay, that their con&s;titution contains within it the means of better government than is &s;uppo&s;ed. I would not have you infer that property is always &s;ecure; I barely &s;ay there are laws written to &s;ecure it. This too I wi&s;h to impre&s;s on you, that the common peo|ple are more free, and that property and life are bet|ter &s;ecured, in Turkey, than in &s;ome European coun|tries. I will mention Spain for one. Like the coun|try we are now contemplating, fear keeps them, as di&s;united individuals, under pa&s;&s;ive obedience in ordi|nary ca&s;es; but, unlike the Spaniards, when notori|ou&s;ly aggrieved&mdash;when their property or religious code is forcibly violated&mdash;when the prince would riot in blood, and per&s;i&s;t in an un&s;ucce&s;sful war&mdash;the Turks appeal to the law; they find a chief; the &s;ol|diery join their &s;tandard, and depo&s;e or de&s;troy him, not on the furious pretext of popular hatred, but upon the legitimate ground of the Koran, as an infidel, and a violator of the laws of GOD and Mahomet&mdash;They always, however, place his regular &s;ucce&s;&s;or on the throne. Yet, notwith&s;tanding the general venality
<PB N="175" REF="031911_0171_0FEF4A8209571148">
which pollutes the fountains of ju&s;tice, and notwith|&s;tanding the great abu&s;e of power to which I have alluded, their internal policy is, in many re&s;pects, ex|cellent, and may be compared with advantage to that of any nation in Europe. Highway-robbery, hou&s;e-breaking, or pilfering, are little known and rarely practi&s;ed among them; and at all times the roads are as &s;ecure as the hou&s;es. Ample provi&s;ions too are made again&s;t tho&s;e petty &s;ecret frauds which many who carry a fair face in England, and would bring an action of damages again&s;t one that &s;hould call them rogues, practi&s;e every day. Bakers are the mo&s;t fre|quent victims of ju&s;tice, and are not unfrequently &s;een hanging at their own doors. They are mulcted and ba&s;tinadoed for the fir&s;t and &s;econd offence, and on the third, a &s;taple is driven up into their door-ca&s;e, and they are hanged from it. Notwith&s;tanding which, men are con&s;tantly found hardy enough to pur&s;ue the &s;ame cour&s;e of practice; and this is the more extra|ordinary, as the police is &s;o &s;trictly attended to, that the ba&s;haw or vizir him&s;elf goes about in di&s;gui&s;e, in order to di&s;cover frauds and detect the connivances of the inferior officers of ju&s;tice. But what will our great ladies, who con&s;ume their nights, de&s;troy their con&s;titution, and &s;quander their hu&s;band's property in gambling; who afterwards, to repair their &s;hat|tered finances, have recour&s;e to the infamous expedi|ent of keeping gaming-hou&s;es, and endeavour to re|cover by degrading means what they have lo&s;t by folly, to the di&s;grace of them&s;elves and family, and the &s;hame of their &s;ex and rank&mdash;What will they &s;ay when I tell them, that gaming is held among the Turks to be as infamous as theft, and a game&s;ter looked upon with more dete&s;tation than a highway robber? The Turki&s;h amba&s;&s;ador and his train will, on their return to their country, have to tell a curious tale of this much-famed i&s;land, in that and other re&s;pects.</P>

<P>PREJUDICE, that canker of the human heart, has injured mankind by impeding per&s;onal in|tercour&s;e, and thereby clogging the channel of intel|lectual improvement: it forbids that interchange of &s;entiment&mdash;that reciprocal communication of opinion &mdash;that generous circulation of intellectual wealth, which, while it enriches another, advances it&s;elf&mdash;it di&s;&s;evers the bond of &s;ocial union, and makes man &s;it down the gloomy, &s;elfi&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of his own mi&s;er|able mite, with too much hatred to give, and too much pride to receive, tho&s;e benefits, which Provi|dence, by leaving our nature &s;o unaccommodated, has pointed out as nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s between man and man: under its influence we &s;purn from us the good, if we di&s;like the hand that offers it, and will rather plunge into the mire than be guided by the light of any one who&s;e opinion is at variance with our own.</P>
<P>Thus it is between the Turks and us&mdash;the little of their affairs which the prejudices of the Mahomedans have allowed them&s;elves to communicate, or &s;uffered others to glean among them, has been in general &s;o mi&s;u&s;ed, di&s;torted, and mi&s;repre&s;ented by the preju|dices of the Chri&s;tians, that it is not going beyond the truth to &s;ay, there exi&s;t not a people in the civilized world who&s;e real hi&s;tory and genuine &s;tate are &s;o little known as tho&s;e of the Turks: and the wor&s;t of it is, that not one mi&s;repre&s;entation, not one &s;ingle mi&s;take has fallen on the generous, charitable &s;ide; but all,
<PB N="177" REF="031911_0173_0FEF4A8664E6EA28">
all without exception tend to repre&s;ent the Turk in the mo&s;t degraded and dete&s;table point of view. As the purity of the Chri&s;tian does not allow him to be guilty of a wilful, uncharitable mi&s;repre&s;entation, we &s;hould attribute it to unavoidable error, were it not that, till &s;ome late authors who&s;e liberality does them honour, they all walked in the very &s;ame track, and could hardly have been &s;o uniformly erroneous from de&s;ign. We mu&s;t therefore attribute it to religious zeal and mi&s;taken piety; in which, in this in&s;tance alone, they &s;eem to be reputable competitors with the Turks. The moro&s;ene&s;s, the animo&s;ity, and the &s;upercilious &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bigot, each holds in common with the other.</P>
<P>One &s;triking feature in the con&s;titution of Turkey is, that neither blood nor &s;plendid birth are of them|&s;elves &s;ufficient to recommend a man to great offices. Merit and abilities alone are the pinions which can lift ambition to its height. The cottager may be ex|alted to the highe&s;t office in the empire; at lea&s;t there is no ab&s;olute impediment in his way; and I believe it has often happened. Compare this with France under its late monarchy, where no merit could rai&s;e a man from the Canaille: this, I &s;ay, is one of the cri|terions of a free con&s;titution, and Turkey is &s;o far de|mocratic.</P>
<P>The very fir&s;t principle ingrafted in the minds of the Mahomedan children, is a high contempt of all religions but their own; and from the minute babes are capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing, they are taught to call Chri&s;tians by the name of Ghiaour, or Infidel: this grows up in their manhood &s;o &s;trong in them, that they will follow a Chri&s;tian through the &s;treets, and even ju&s;tle again&s;t him with contempt, crying, Ghia|our! Ghiaour! or Infidel! Infidel!&mdash;Men of dignity and rank, indeed, will treat Chri&s;tians with courte&s;y; but as &s;oon as they are gone out of hearing, will call
<PB N="178" REF="031911_0174_0FEF4A8AC086CFB8">
them dog! This is mon&s;trous! But let us recollect how a Turk would be treated in Spain or Portugal, and we &s;hall &s;ee that inhuman bigotry may be found in a greater degree among Chri&s;tians than even Ma|homedans. In Spain or Portugal they would treat them thus:&mdash;the common people would call them hogs; they would ju&s;tle them al&s;o in contempt; and what is more, they would &s;tab them (it has often happened) <HI>por amor de Dios;</HI> and as to the people of rank, they would very con&s;cientiou&s;ly con&s;ign them to the Inqui&s;ition, where the pious fathers of the church would very piou&s;ly con&s;ign them to the flames, and coolly go to the altar, and pray to GOD to damn them hereafter to all eternity. So far the balance, I think, is in favour of the Turks. Need I go far|ther?&mdash;I will.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Mahomedans are divided into two &s;ects, as the Chri&s;tians are into many. Tho&s;e are the &s;ect of Ali, and the &s;ect of Omar. Now, I have never heard among them of one &s;ect burning the other delibe|rately: but the Roman Catholics, even now, burn Prote&s;tants by juridical &s;entence&mdash;burn their fellow Chri&s;tians to death for differing from them in a mere &s;peculative point of doctrine. Which then are the better men? I am &s;ure it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay: though bad are the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The Turks are allowed, by tho&s;e who know them be&s;t, to have &s;ome excellent qualities; and I think, that in the prodigality of our cen&s;ure, which, though little acquainted with them, we are forward to be|&s;tow, it would be but fair to give them credit for many of tho&s;e good qualities, which even among our|&s;elves it requires the greate&s;t intimacy and the warme&s;t mutual confidence and e&s;teem to di&s;clo&s;e or di&s;cover in each other. That they have many vices is certain. What people are they that have not? Gaming they dete&s;t; wine they u&s;e not, or at lea&s;t u&s;e only a lit|tle,
<PB N="179" REF="031911_0175_0FEF4A8D5E544C28">
and that by &s;tealth; and as to the plurality of women, it can in them be &s;carcely deemed a vice, &s;ince their religion allows it. One vice, and one only, of a dark dye is laid to their charge; and that has been trumpeted forth with the grievous and horrid addition, that though contradictory to nature, it was allowed by their religion. This I have rea&s;on to be|lieve is one of the many fabrications and artifices of Chri&s;tian zealots, to render Mahomedani&s;m more odi|ous: for I have been informed from the mo&s;t compe|tent and re&s;pectable authority, and am therefore per|&s;uaded, that the dete&s;table crime to which I allude, is forbidden both by the Koran and their municipal laws; that it is openly condemned by all, as with us; and that, though candour mu&s;t allow there are many who practice it (by the bye there are too many in England who are &s;uppo&s;ed to do the &s;ame), there are none hardy or &s;hamele&s;s enough not to endeavour to conceal it; and, in &s;hort, that it is apparently as much reprobated there as any where; which, at all events, re&s;cues the laws and religion of the country from that &s;tigma.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is no part of the world where the flame of parental affection burns with more ardent and unextingui&s;hable &s;trength, or is more faithfully re|turned by reciprocal tenderne&s;s and filial obedience, than Turkey. Educated in the mo&s;t unaffected defe|rence and pious &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their parents' will; trained both by precept and example to the greate&s;t veneration for the aged, and &s;eparated almo&s;t from their infancy from the women, they acquire a mo|de&s;ty to their &s;uperiors, and a ba&s;hfulne&s;s and re&s;pect|ful deportment to the weaker &s;ex, which never cea&s;e to influence them through life. A Turk meeting a woman in the &s;treet, turns his head from her, as if looking at her were criminal; and there is nothing they dete&s;t &s;o much, or will more &s;edulou&s;ly &s;hun,
<PB N="180" REF="031911_0176_0FEF4A8EEBF547D8">
than an impudent, audacious woman. To get the better of a Turk therefore, there is nothing further nece&s;&s;ary, than to let &s;lip a virago at him, and he in|&s;tantly retreats.</P>
<P>Since the arrival of the Turki&s;h amba&s;&s;ador in Lon|don, I have had frequent occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the people of his train have been already, by the good example of our Briti&s;h belles and beaux, pretty much ea&s;ed of their national mode&s;ty, and can look at the women with as broad and intrepid a &s;tare, as the greate&s;t puppy in the metropolis.</P>
<P>Their habitual tenderne&s;s and deference for the fair &s;ex, while it &s;peaks much for their manly gal|lantry, mu&s;t be allowed by candour to be carried to an exce&s;s extravagant and irrational. It is the greate&s;t di&s;grace to the character of a Turk to lift his hand to a woman: this is, doubtle&s;s, right, with &s;ome limita|tions; but they carry it &s;o far as to allow no provo|cation, be it what it may, &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify u&s;ing force or &s;trokes to a woman; the utmo&s;t they can do is, to &s;cold and walk off. The con&s;equence of this is, that the women often run into the mo&s;t violent ex|ce&s;&s;es. There have been in&s;tances where they have been guilty of the mo&s;t furious outrages; where they have violated the laws in a collected body, and broke open public &s;tores of corn laid up by the government: the magi&s;trates attended, the Jani&s;&s;aries were called, and came running to quell the riot&mdash;but, behold they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who committed it: they knew no way of re&s;i&s;ting them, unle&s;s by force; and force they could not u&s;e: &s;o the ladies were permitted quietly to do their work in defiance of magi&s;trates, law, right, and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Among the variety of errors and moral ab&s;urdities fal&s;ely a&s;cribed to the Mahomedan religion, the ex|clu&s;ion of women from Paradi&s;e holds a very con&s;pi|cuous place, as a charge equally fal&s;e and ab&s;urd;
<PB N="181" REF="031911_0177_0FEF4A9299858220">
on the contrary, the women have their fa&s;ts, their ablutions, and the other religious rites deemed by Mahomedans nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. Notwith&s;tanding, it has been the practice of travellers to have recour&s;e to invention, where the cu&s;toms of the country pre|cluded po&s;itive information; and to give their ac|counts rather from the &s;ugge&s;tions of their own pre|judiced imaginations, than from any fair inferences or conclu&s;ions drawn from the facts that came under their ob&s;ervation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject I touched upon in my la&s;t three letters, and on which this, and probably &s;ome &s;ucceeding ones, will turn, is attended with circum&s;tances of great delicacy, and may po&s;&s;ibly bear the a&s;pect of at lea&s;t a dubious import, as touching the great point of reli|gion. I will therefore, before I proceed further, explain to you (le&s;t it &s;hould require explanation) the whole &s;cope of my meaning.</P>
<P>My object throughout the whole of what I have &s;aid re&s;pecting the Turks, is to war with prejudice, not to draw compari&s;ons:&mdash;to &s;hew that where the Mahomedans are vicious or en&s;laved, it is not the fault of their religion or their laws:&mdash;to convince you, the Turks are not the only people in the world, who, under all the external forms of &s;anctity and religion, are capable of the mo&s;t dete&s;table crimes, and &s;ome|times, utterly bereft of all preten&s;ions to charity&mdash;
<PB N="182" REF="031911_0178_0FEF4A942879CD18">
and that, while they have been held up as a per|petual &s;ubject of reproach and accu&s;ation, they were committing only ju&s;t the &s;ame crimes that con&s;cience might have retorted on their accu&s;ers. If allowance can be at all made for hi&s;torical mi&s;repre&s;entation, we may perhaps be di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider that of the ignorant Catholic mi&s;&s;ionaries of the early ages, as entitled to &s;ome excu&s;e, or at lea&s;t mitigation. The intemperate zeal of tho&s;e times forbade the full exer|ci&s;e of the rational faculties; but in this age of illumi|nation and liberality, he that fal&s;ifies from polemical malice &s;hould meet little quarter and le&s;s belief. And it mu&s;t be grievous to all men of virtue and religion to reflect, that churchmen, di&s;ciples of the Chri&s;tian church, which &s;hould be the fountain of purity and truth, have been foremo&s;t in the li&s;t of fal&s;ifiers.</P>
<P>The difficulty of obtaining information of any kind in Turkey, is very great; of their religion chiefly they are extremely tenacious; and as to their women, it is allowed by the be&s;t-informed men, who have lived there for many years, in departments of life that gave them the be&s;t means of obtaining information Europeans can have, that, at be&s;t, but a very imperfect know|ledge can be had of them. Yet travellers who pro|bably never migrated farther than "from the green bed to the brown," have given us diffu&s;e accounts of their religion; and adventurers who never were beyond the purlieus of Drury, have &s;caled Seraglio walls, and carried off the favourites of Sultans.</P>
<P>The truth is, my dear FREDERICK, the Turks, like all other people, have their &s;hare of vices, but are by no means countenanced in them by their reli|gion; and from what I have been able to collect, as well from my own inquiries and ob&s;ervations, as from reading the be&s;t hi&s;torians, I am per&s;uaded that they have not, in the whole &s;cope of Mahomedani&s;m, one doctrine &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of virtue, or &s;o encourag|ing
<PB N="183" REF="031911_0179_0FEF4A95C4645FD8">
to the indulgence of vice, as many that are to be found in that curious code, Popery.</P>
<P>The malice of our intemperate zealots again&s;t Maho|medani&s;m has been of cour&s;e extended to its founder with more than common exaggeration and additions. They have repre&s;ented Mahomet to be a man of mean origin, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a mind unenlightened by &s;cience or literature, and an under&s;tanding and facul|ties naturally gro&s;s. All tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions are un|doubtedly fal&s;e;&mdash;he &s;prung from the mo&s;t noble of all the Arabian tribes&mdash;the Corai&s;hites: at his time, poverty, &s;o far from being a reproach among them, was a mark of every thing that was great and dignified, if &s;upported with magnanimity and fortitude; and the two fir&s;t caliphs lived as poor as Mahomet him&s;elf, although they had immen&s;e revenues, commanded va&s;t armies, and were lords of great provinces. As to his under&s;tanding I can only &s;ay, that perhaps he was the very la&s;t man in the world who&s;e intellectual powers &s;hould be called in que&s;tion. His genius was unbounded, his &s;pirit enterpri&s;ing, his powers of addre&s;s were unequalled, he was allowed to be the greate&s;t orator of his time; and yet, with all the&s;e qualifications, his under&s;tanding was &s;lighted. It is a logical truth, that when people prove too much, they prove nothing at all: our Chri&s;tian zealots, in this in&s;tance, have over&s;hot the mark, and thereby rendered all their other information at lea&s;t doubtful. Perhaps the con&s;ummation of all policy was Mahomet's preten|ding to be an idiot, in order to make his great and wonderful effu&s;ions appear to be the immediate in&s;pira|tion of Heaven&mdash;He called him&s;elf THE IDIOT PRO|PHET.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mohammed.</NOTE></P>
<P>The whole of Mahomedani&s;m may be reduced &s;imply to this one article of faith&mdash;"There is but one GOD,
<PB N="184" REF="031911_0180_0FEF4A98C44F7078">
and MAHOMET is his prophet;" but upon this they have &s;uperinduced, from time to time, &s;uch a variety of ab&s;urdities as would require volumes to de|&s;cribe: however, in &s;trict candour let us reflect, and a&s;k our own hearts the que&s;tion, whether &s;prinkling with holy water, or wor&s;hiping a bit of white wafer as GOD, can be exceeded, or are le&s;s ab&s;urd than the periodical ablutions of the Turks, or their going on a pilgrimage to Mecca?</P>
<P>With regard to the women, I have &s;aid before that the be&s;t information we can obtain is very imperfect; all I have been able to collect, you &s;hall have. They are formed in a &s;tyle of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;ymmetry, particularly about the che&s;t and bo&s;om; they have delicate &s;kins, regular features, black hair and eyes, and are, above all other beings, cleanly and neat in their per&s;ons, bathing twice a day regularly, be&s;ides on other occa&s;ions, and not &s;uffering even the &s;malle&s;t hair to remain upon their bodies. They are kept in the mo&s;t rigorous confinement, and only per&s;ons of ill fame paint. Women of character are there cha&s;te&mdash;nor is their cha&s;tity to be attributed to re&s;traint merely, for, from their infancy they are trained to di&s;cretion and &s;elf-&s;ubjection, and the mo|de&s;ty natural to the &s;ex is cheri&s;hed from its fir&s;t dawnings. When they grow up, they are not, like our women here, &s;ubjected to the contagion of in|famous gallantry; neither are the men trained to, nor do they pride them&s;elves, like &s;ome among us, on the arts of &s;eduction. In fact, that practice makes no part of the accompli&s;hments of their fine gentlemen; nay, it is held by them to be infamous. There are no &s;uch characters to be found in Turkey as your box-lobby loungers&mdash;none of your up&s;tart cubs like tho&s;e who doudle the be&s;t part of the day through Pall-Mall, St. James's-&s;treet and Bond-&s;treet; who, without birth, wealth, education, or parts, fancy them|&s;elves
<PB N="185" REF="031911_0181_0FEF4A9C85159708">
fine fellows, and powder their no&s;es in ladies' head-dre&s;&s;es, whi&s;pering them in order to get the re|putation of gallantry; who &s;trut like Bantam cocks, and a&s;&s;ume a fierce air to conceal their con&s;cious want of &s;pirit; and dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;uit of regimentals bought by papa, at mama's reque&s;t, to exhibit &s;weet Ma&s;ter Jacky to advantage in the Park&mdash;though never to be &s;oiled with gunpower, or perforated with a ball in the na&s;ty field of battle!!!&mdash;My dear FREDRICK, I have often told you that you &s;hall make choice of your own profe&s;&s;ion. If you &s;hould choo&s;e any of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, you may fail in it without di&s;|honour; for many of the able&s;t men have failed be|fore: but, mark me! avoid the military as you would ruin, unle&s;s you have the requi&s;ites; let not the glitter of a &s;carlet coat, or the empty name of a &s;oldier, tempt you to be like one of tho&s;e mi&s;erable animals I have de&s;cribed. There may be characters more wicked&mdash;I know none &s;o utterly contemptible.</P>
<P>All extremes are bad; but the exceedings of virtue even where they run into error, are &s;till perferable to vice. However ludicrous it may appear, we cannot ab&s;olutely de&s;pi&s;e or condemn the prudery of the Turki&s;h women, though it runs into &s;uch extravagance, that, when feeding their poultry, they keep carefully vieled if there happens to be a cock among them, &s;o fa&s;tidiou&s;ly aver&s;e are they to the odious male creature &s;eeing their pretty faces.</P>
<P>When the circum&s;tances under which the Turki&s;h women &s;tand are con&s;idered, it mu&s;t appear amazing, that cha&s;tity, from principle, is univer&s;al among them, as it is confe&s;&s;ed to be: the nature of man urges him to de&s;ire, with greate&s;t ardour, that which is mo&s;t forbidden; and women who are much confined, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have their pa&s;&s;ions inflamed by the exaggerated workings of the imagination. In|fidelity, however, to the marriage-bed, is much le&s;s
<PB N="186" REF="031911_0182_0FEF4A9E1249A400">
frequent among the men there, than among the women here; and the tide of fa&s;hion, which in this country gives &s;uch a rapid and irre&s;i&s;tible circulation to vice and adultery, runs there in an oppo&s;ite direction; and contrary to our cu&s;toms, no man is &s;o unfa&s;hionable in Turkey as he that has interrupted the dome&s;tic peace of a family by &s;eduction.</P>
<P>Among the many virtues which may with &s;trict ju&s;tice be a&s;cribed to the Turks, ho&s;pitality holds a con&s;picuous place. It is not confined to common civility, it extends to per&s;onal protection. Many deem it ab&s;olutely their duty to ri&s;k their lives in defence of their gue&s;ts; nor will any motive, however cogent, be allowed to ju&s;tify the violation of it. Nay, to &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem is it carried up, that an engagement with a &s;tranger is accepted as an excu&s;e for not obey|ing the &s;ummons of a great man, when no other apology, not even that of indi&s;po&s;ition, would be admitted.</P>
<P>While the Turks abhor and de&s;pi&s;e all other re|ligions but their own, their government is by no means intolerant in &s;piritual concerns. The exerci&s;e of all religions is free, and at Con&s;tantinople (we are told) Monks dre&s;s in their habits, and are allowed at funeral proce&s;&s;ions to elevate the cro&s;s, which is more than the Engli&s;h tyranny allowed the Roman Catholics of Ireland to do, till very lately: a Turk, however, convicted of apo&s;tacy, could not by any means e&s;cape death. Meantime it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that if they keep up a decent &s;emblance of the forms of their religion, no intru&s;ive inquiry is made into their real faith: and though it is one of the injunc|tions of Mahomet to endeavour to convert unbelievers, and they &s;ometimes in obedience to that command &s;olicit the conver&s;ion of Chri&s;tians and others; they never fail to con&s;ider any renegado, or per&s;on who becomes a convert, with contempt, if not di&s;like.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="031911_0183_0FEF4A9FA02AF470">I will conclude this letter with an extract from that mo&s;t valuable and accurate work, Ru&s;&s;el's Hi&s;tory of Aleppo, which will give you a better, becau&s;e a true, notion of Turki&s;h morals, than you are likely to receive from general opinion. "Upon the whole," &s;ays he, "whether it be a&s;cribed to the influence of their political con&s;titution, or to the ab&s;ence of various temptations, which in Europe often lead to the vio|lation of better laws; there are perhaps few great cities where many of the private and dome&s;tic vir|tues are in general more prevalent than at Aleppo."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>THE u&s;e of periodical &s;tated times of devo|tion is univer&s;ally admitted, and the nece&s;&s;ity of adopt|ing them makes a part of the Chri&s;tian code. The Mahomedan religion, however, exceeds it far in the rigid attention to, and frequency of, devotion. There are no le&s;s than five &s;tated times of prayer in every twenty-four hours, fixed as indi&s;pen&s;able, at none of which a true believer fails; and the fervency of their praying exceeds even the frequency. I have heard it a&s;&s;erted, that if the hou&s;e was to take fire while they are at their devotion, they would not break off; and &s;o rigidly intent do they conceive it their duty to be during the time of prayer, that if in the mid&s;t of it they were interrupted by a fit of &s;neezing or coughing, they con&s;ider all already done as gone for nothing, and always begin them again.&mdash;And to tell
<PB N="188" REF="031911_0184_0FEF4AA27374DDE8">
a truth of them, if the Chri&s;tians cur&s;e them, they are pretty even with them in return, never failing to pray for di&s;cord, enmity, and di&s;&s;en&s;ion among their enemies, as well as health and pro&s;perity to them|&s;elves; and to the efficacy of tho&s;e prayers they fondly attribute all the wars and di&s;&s;en&s;ions which in|ce&s;&s;antly hara&s;s Chri&s;tendom. A bell tolls as a pub|lic notice of prayer; and when a true Mahomedan hears it, let him be where he will, whether at home or abroad, in the highway or in the market, be the place dirty or clean, wet or dry, he immediately falls down and wor&s;hips.</P>
<P>As &s;ub&s;idiary to prayer they have their ablutions, in which they are full as &s;crupulou&s;ly punctual as in their prayers. One is preparatory to prayer, another after cohabitation with women, a third before eating, and another again incidental. Tho&s;e they never neglect to perform, unle&s;s &s;ome in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle lies in the way. Charity, that mo&s;t glorious doctrine of any re|ligion, is enjoined by the Koran under the mo&s;t heavy denunciation of heavenly vengeance, in ca&s;e of ne|glect; and by it they are charged to regard no bounds in liberality to the poor. Many Mu&s;&s;ulmen in their zeal to di&s;charge this duty have given a fourth, many a third, and &s;ome one half of their property. Nay, the in&s;tances are not unfrequent of men giving away their all, and living afterwards them&s;elves upon alms. To do &s;trict ju&s;tice it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that poverty is no where &s;o re&s;pectfully attended to, honoured, or re|verenced, as among the Mahomedans; who have a &s;aying among them, "that the fear of want is a mark of the judgment of GOD."</P>
<P>Ab&s;tinence is con&s;idered as a virtue among them, and very &s;trictly enjoined as a religious duty. The great fa&s;t appointed by the Koran continues for the month of Ramedan, during which time they neither eat, drink, nor conver&s;e with their wives, from &s;un-ri&s;e
<PB N="189" REF="031911_0185_0FEF4AA44F0E2428">
till the &s;tars appear, or the lamps are hung out at the mo&s;ques. Any man who breaks it is puni&s;hed with death; but the wor&s;t of it is, that they will not allow even travellers, the &s;ick or the wounded, to plead a right to exemption: &s;ome of the Turks, however, and all the Chri&s;tians, have hit upon expedients to pa&s;s the month without much mortification; that is, &s;leep|ing in bed all day, and &s;itting up and carou&s;ing all night, to evade the re&s;traint.</P>
<P>The la&s;t and greate&s;t ordinance of their religion is the pilgrimage to Mecca, which when once accom|pli&s;hed is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a direct pa&s;&s;port to Heaven; and there are few of them who do not at one time or other of their lives take that painful and hazardous journey. As this is a very intere&s;ting journey, how|ever, to travel in the clo&s;et, as it includes the de&s;crip|tion of a caravan, and &s;erves to &s;hew to what extre|mities enthu&s;ia&s;m can influence men, I will give you a de&s;cription of it as handed to me by a very accurate and ingenious per&s;on, on who&s;e preci&s;e veracity I can rely; fir&s;t making &s;ome remarks upon the preceding part of this letter.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve from what I have already &s;aid, that, excepting the mere points of religious faith, the moral ordinances of Mahomedani&s;m comprehend mo&s;t of tho&s;e parts of the Chri&s;tian religion, on the prac|tice of which the reputation of piety is founded; and that for &s;trict obedience to tho&s;e ordinances the Maho|medans are more remarkable than we are. Adultery is not frequent among them; wine is &s;eldom or never u&s;ed; theft is little known; &s;o is murder. Then in the practical parts of devotion, there are in the fir&s;t place prayers; &s;econdly, ab&s;tinence or fa&s;ting; thirdly, charity. Tho&s;e are all Chri&s;tian doctrines, more zea|lou&s;ly ob&s;erved by them than by us. Their ablutions are at lea&s;t no injury to the cau&s;e of morality or piety; but rather, being done as a religious exerci&s;e, &s;erve
<PB N="190" REF="031911_0186_0FEF4AA853A7FB80">
to keep up the &s;eries of intercour&s;e which &s;hould &s;ub|&s;i&s;t between the creature and his Creator: be&s;ides, I cannot help thinking with our inimitable poet Thom|&s;on, that

And as to the pilgrimage to Mecca, however irra|tional it may appear to us, it is at lea&s;t recommended by &s;incerity and zeal, and is doubtle&s;s in the eye of an all-&s;eeing Providence meritorious. HE, we are to &s;uppo&s;e, will judge, not by the value of the act, but the purity of the motive; and will accept it as the offering of a frail, blind mortal, bending in obedience to that which he conceives to be the will of Heaven. Be&s;ides, for the life of me I cannot &s;ee why a pilgri|mage to Mecca is at all more culpable than a pilgri|mage to Jeru&s;alem; not to mention the thou&s;and other holy places to which well-meaning Chri&s;tians go, for their &s;oul's &s;ake, at imminent hazard of their lives, and certain mortification and hard&s;hip to their bodies.</P>

pretexts upon which tho&s;e animo&s;ities are grounded render it only the more horrible. One would think that the &s;ub&s;tantial traffic of life, and the &s;truggle of mankind for the &s;uperfluities of it, of them&s;elves af|forded ample materials for &s;cuffle, without re&s;orting to the &s;hadows of &s;peculation for contention.

<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible that I could obtain from the bounty of Heaven a grant of the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart, that wi&s;h &s;hould be to &s;ee all mankind in harmony and mu|tual good will, ranging without di&s;tinction under the one great name of man and brother.

<P>Among the gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations of which I com|plain, and which for the &s;ake of mankind I lament, is that general fal&s;ehood, the infidelity of the Turki&s;h women. The re&s;pectable author whom I have before taken the freedom of quoting, I mean Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, de|clares that in twenty years re&s;idence at Aleppo, he did not remember a public in&s;tance of adultery; and that in the private walks of &s;candal tho&s;e he heard of

were among the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, and did not in number exceed a dozen. "In re&s;pect to the Franks (conti|nues he) the undertaking is attended not only with &s;uch ri&s;k to the individual, but may in its con&s;equences &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly involve the whole &s;ettlement, that it is either never attempted, or is concealed with a &s;ecrecy unexampled in other matters. I have rea&s;on to be|lieve that European travellers have &s;ometimes had a Greek courte&s;an impo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them for a &s;ultana; and after having been heartily frightened, have been in|duced to pay &s;inartly, in order to pre&s;erve a &s;ecret which the day after was known to half the &s;i&s;terhood in town."

<P>On the &s;ubject of the Turki&s;h moral character, I have endeavoured to be as conci&s;e as ju&s;tice would allow me to be; and yet I find that I have gone to &s;ome length. I cannot however di&s;mi&s;s it without giving you a trait to which the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate polemi|cal prejudice, and the mo&s;t inveterate hatred, mu&s;t in &s;pite of them pay the tribute of applau&s;e. Their treatment to their &s;laves is beyond all example among us humane, tender, and generous, and &s;uch as may well bring a blu&s;h into the faces of Chri&s;tian dealers in human fle&s;h. When young &s;laves, male or female, are bought by a Turk, they &s;eem to be introduced into the family rather in the condition of an adopted child; they receive the &s;ame education, perform nearly the &s;ame offices, and are bound to no greater marks of re&s;pect than their ma&s;ter's own children&mdash; and in fact feel none of the galling circum&s;tances of a &s;tate of &s;ervility; the very wor&s;t treatment they ever receive is to be put on a footing with the menial do|me&s;tics, or ordered to the &s;ame duty as a valet or a page. It often happens, on the other hand, that they are married into the family, and very, frequently are promoted to high offices in the &s;tate. If they adopt

<P>The following is the be&s;t de&s;cription I am able to give you of an Ea&s;tern caravan. It exactly coincides with my own ob&s;ervations, and with the various ac|counts I have had from others.

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF A CARAVAN. Inclo&s;ed in the preceding Letter.</HEAD>
<P>A CARAVAN, which is &s;o often mentioned in the hi&s;tory and de&s;cription of the Ea&s;t, and in all the tales and &s;tories of tho&s;e countries, is an a&s;&s;emblage of travellers, partly pilgrims, partly merchants, who col|lect together in order to con&s;olidate a &s;ufficient force to protect them, in travelling through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ideous wilds and burning de&s;erts over which they are con|&s;trained to pa&s;s for commercial and other purpo&s;es; tho&s;e wilds being infe&s;ted with Arabs, who make a profe&s;&s;ion of pillage, and rob in mo&s;t formidable bo|dies, &s;ome almo&s;t as large as &s;mall armies. As the collection of &s;uch a number requires time, and the em|bodying of them is a &s;erious concern, it is concerted with great care and preparation, and is never at|tempted without the permi&s;&s;ion of the prince in who&s;e dominions it is to be formed, and of tho&s;e al&s;o through who&s;e dominions it is to pa&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed in writing. The exact number of men and carriages, mules, hor&s;es, and other bea&s;ts of burthen, are &s;pecified in the licen&s;e; and the merchants to whom the caravan
<PB N="194" REF="031911_0190_0FEF4AB2A1308560">
belongs, regulate and direct every thing appertaining to its government and police during the journey, and appoint the various officers nece&s;&s;ary for conducting it.</P>
<P>Each caravan has four principal officers: the fir&s;t, the caravanbachi, or head of the caravan; the &s;econd, the captain of the march; the third, the captain of the &s;top or re&s;t; and the fourth, the captain of the di&s;tribution. The fir&s;t has the uncontrolable autho|rity and command over all the others, and gives them his orders: the &s;econd is ab&s;olute during the march; but his authority immediately cea&s;es on the &s;topping or encamping of the caravan, when the third a&s;&s;umes his &s;hare of the authority, and exerts it during the time of its remaining at re&s;t: and the fourth orders the di&s;po&s;ition of every part of the caravan, in ca&s;e of an attack or battle. This la&s;t officer has al&s;o during the march the in&s;pection and direction of the di&s;tribution of provi&s;ions, which is conducted under his manage|ment by &s;everal inferior officers, who are obliged to give &s;ecurity to the ma&s;ter of the caravan; each of them having the care of a certain number of men, elephants, dromedaries, camels, &amp;c. &amp;c. which they undertake to conduct and furni&s;h with provi&s;ions at their own ri&s;que, according to an agreement &s;tipulated between them.</P>
<P>A fifth officer of the caravan is the pay-ma&s;ter or trea&s;urer, who has under him a great many clerks and interpreters, appointed to keep accurate journals of all the material incidents that occur upon the journey. And it is by the&s;e journals, &s;igned by the &s;uperior of|ficers, that the owners of the caravan judge whether they have been well or ill &s;erved or conducted.</P>
<P>Another kind of officers are the mathematicians, without whom no caravan will pre&s;ume to &s;et out. There are commonly three of them attached to a ca|ravan or large &s;ize; and they perform the offices both of quarter-ma&s;ters and aides-de-camp, leading the
<PB N="195" REF="031911_0191_0FEF4AB446FB27B8">
troops when the caravan is attacked, and a&s;&s;igning the quarters where the caravan is appointed to encamp.</P>
<P>There are no le&s;s than five di&s;tinct &s;orts of cara|vans: fir&s;t, the heavy caravans, which are compo&s;ed of elephants, dromedaries, camels, and hor&s;es; &s;e|condly, the light caravans, which have but few ele|phants; thirdly, the common caravans, where there are none of tho&s;e animals; fourthly, the hor&s;e cara|vans, where there are neither dromedaries nor camels; and la&s;tly, &s;ea caravans, con&s;i&s;ting of ve&s;&s;els; from whence you will ob&s;erve that the word caravan is not confined to the land, but extends to the water al&s;o.</P>
<P>The proportion ob&s;erved in the heavy caravan is as follows: When there are five hundred elephants, they add a thou&s;and dromedaries and two thou&s;and hor&s;es at the lea&s;t; and then the e&s;cort is compo&s;ed of four thou&s;and men on hor&s;eback. Two men are required for leading one elephant, five for three dro|medaries, and &s;even for eleven camels. This multi|tude of &s;ervants, together with the officers and pa&s;|&s;engers, who&s;e number is uncertain, &s;erve to &s;upport the e&s;cort in ca&s;e of a fight, and render the caravan more formidable and &s;ecure. The pa&s;&s;engers are not ab&s;olutely obliged to fight; but according to the laws and u&s;ages of the caravans, if they refu&s;e to do &s;o, they are not entitled to any provi&s;ions whatever from the caravan, even though they &s;hould agree to pay an extravagant price for them.</P>
<P>Every elephant is mounted by what they call a nick; that is to &s;ay, a young lad of nine or ten years old, brought up to the bu&s;ine&s;s, who drives the elephant, and pricks it with a pointed iron to animate it in the fight: the &s;ame lad al&s;o loads the fire-arms of the two &s;oldiers who mount the elephant, with him.</P>
<P>The day of the caravan &s;etting out being once fixed, is never altered or po&s;tponed; &s;o that no di&s;|appointment can po&s;&s;ibly en&s;ue to any one.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="031911_0192_0FEF4AB700031510">One would &s;uppo&s;e that &s;o enormous and powerful a body, &s;o well armed, might be certain of moving forward without fear of being robbed; but as mo&s;t of the Arabian princes have no other means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t but by their robberies, they keep &s;pies in all parts, who give them notice when the caravans &s;et out, which they way-lay; and &s;ometimes attack with &s;uperior force, overpower them, plunder them of all their trea&s;ure, and make &s;laves of the whole convoy &mdash;foreigners excepted, to whom they generally &s;hew more mercy. If they are repul&s;ed, they generally come to &s;ome agreement; the conditions of which are pretty well ob&s;erved, e&s;pecially if the a&s;&s;ailants are native Arabians. The carrying on of robberies with &s;uch armies may appear a&s;toni&s;hing; but when the temptation is con&s;idered, and when it is known that one caravan only is &s;ometimes enough to enrich tho&s;e princes, much of our &s;urpri&s;e vani&s;hes.</P>
<P>They are obliged to u&s;e great precautions to prevent the caravan from introducing that dreadful di&s;temper, the plague, into the places through which they pa&s;s, or from being them&s;elves infected with it. When therefore they arrive near a town, the inhabitants of the town and the people of the caravan hold a &s;olemn conference concerning the &s;tate of their health, and very &s;incerely communicate to each other the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, candidly informing each other whe|ther there be danger on either &s;ide.&mdash;When there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect any contagious di&s;temper, they amicably agree that no communication whatever &s;hall take place between them; and if the caravan &s;tands in need of provi&s;ions, they are conveyed to them with the utmo&s;t caution over the walls of the town.</P>
<P>The fatigues, hard&s;hips, and hazards, attending tho&s;e caravans, are &s;o great, that they certainly would never be undertaken, if the amazing profits did not in &s;ome mea&s;ure counterbalance them.&mdash;The merchant
<PB N="197" REF="031911_0193_0FEF326AAA9BF198">
who travels in them mu&s;t be content with &s;uch pro|vi&s;ions as he can get, mu&s;t part with all his deli|cacies, and give up all hope of ea&s;e; he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the frightful confu&s;ion of languages and nations; the fatigues of long marches over &s;ands, and under a climate almo&s;t &s;ufficiently hot to reduce him to a cinder: he mu&s;t &s;ubmit cheerfully to exorbitant duties fraudulently levied, and audacious robberies and &s;ubtle tricks practi&s;ed by the herd of vagabonds who follow the caravans&mdash;for preventing which, the merchants have a variety of well contrived locks, that can only be opened by tho&s;e who know the knack of them.</P>
<P>But in &s;ome tracks of caravans there are dangers, and horrible ones again&s;t which no human fore&s;ight or power can provide, and beneath which whole cara|vans &s;ink, and are never after heard of.</P>
<P>The Egyptian caravans are particularly &s;ubject to hazards in the horrid tracks they are nece&s;&s;arily obliged to take through &s;andy de&s;erts, where, for boundle&s;s extents, nature has denied one &s;ingle circum|&s;tance of favour; where a blade of gra&s;s never grew, nor a drop of water ever ran; where the &s;corching fire of the &s;un has bani&s;hed the kindly influence of the other elements; where, for &s;everal days journey, no object meets the eye to guide the parched traveller in his way; and where the ca&s;ual track of one cara|van is clo&s;ed by the moving &s;ands, before another can come to take advantage of it. In tho&s;e va&s;t plains of burning &s;ands, if the guide &s;hould happen to lo&s;e his way, the provi&s;ion of water, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to carry them to the place where they are to find more, mu&s;t infallibly fail them: in &s;uch a ca&s;e the mules and hor&s;es die with fatigue and thir&s;t; and even the camels, notwith&s;tanding their extraordinary power to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without water, &s;oon peri&s;h in the &s;ame manner, together with the people of the caravan, wandering in tho&s;e frightful de&s;erts.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="031911_0194_0FEF4ABC79BDA978">But more dreadful &s;till, and &s;till more inevita|ble, is the danger when a &s;outh wind happens to ri&s;e in tho&s;e &s;andy de&s;erts.

This wind, to which the Arabs give the epithet of poi|&s;oned, often &s;tifles in a moment tho&s;e who have the misfortune to meet it; to prevent which, they are obliged to throw them&s;elves immediately on the ground, putting their faces clo&s;e to the burning &s;ands which &s;ur|round them on all &s;ides, and covering their mouths with &s;ome linen cloth, le&s;t by breathing they &s;hould &s;wallow in&s;tantaneous death, which this wind carries with it wherever it extends.&mdash;Be&s;ides which, whole caravans are often buried under moving hills of burn|ing &s;and, rai&s;ed by the agitation of the winds.</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF THE CEREMONIES OBSERVED BY PIL|GRIMS ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT MECCA.</HEAD>
<P>THE caravans are generally &s;o ordered, as to arrive at Mecca about forty days after the Fa&s;t of Ramedan, and immediately previous to the Corban, or Great Sacrifice. Five or &s;ix days before that fe&s;tival, the three great caravans, viz. that from Europe, that from A&s;ia Minor, and that from Arabia, unite; and all, con|&s;i&s;ting of about two hundred thou&s;and men, and three hundred thou&s;and bea&s;ts of burthen, encamp at &s;ome miles from Mecca. The pilgrims form them&s;elves into &s;mall detachments, and enter the town to arrange the ceremonies preparatory to the Great Sacrifice. They are led through a &s;treet of continual a&s;cent, till they arrive at a gate on an eminence, called the Gate of Health. From thence they &s;ee the great mo&s;que which inclo&s;es the Hou&s;e of Abraham. They &s;alute it with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect and devotion, re|peating twice, "Salam Alek Iru&s;oul Allah!" that is
<PB N="200" REF="031911_0196_0FEF4AC0C6369F38">
to &s;ay, "Peace be with the Amba&s;&s;ador of God!" Thence, at &s;ome di&s;tance, they mount five &s;teps to a large platform faced with &s;tone, where they offer up their prayers; they then de&s;cend on the other &s;ide of it, and advance towards two arches, of the &s;ame kind of dimen&s;ions, but at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, through which they pa&s;s with great &s;ilence and devotion. This ceremony mu&s;t be preformed &s;even times.</P>
<P>From hence proceeding to the great mo&s;que which inclo&s;es the Hou&s;e of Abraham, they enter the mo&s;que, and walk &s;even times round the little building con|tained within it, &s;aying, "This is the Hou&s;e of GOD, and of his &s;ervant Abraham." Then ki&s;&s;ing with great veneration a black &s;tone, &s;aid to have de&s;cended white from Heaven, they go to the famous well called Zun Zun, which the angel &s;hewed to Hagar when &s;he was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the de&s;ert, and could find no water for her &s;on I&s;hmael, and which the Arabs call Zem Zem. Into this well they plunge with all their clothes, repeating "Toba Alla, Toba Alla!" that is to &s;ay, "Forgivene&s;s, GOD! Forgivene&s;s, GOD!" They drink a draught of that foetid, turbid water, and depart.</P>
<P>The duty of bathing and drinking they are obliged to pa&s;s through once; but tho&s;e who would gain Paradi&s;e before the others, mu&s;t repeat it once a day during the &s;tay of the caravan at Mecca.</P>
<P>At fifteen miles from the town of Mecca there is a hill called "Ghiabal Arafata," or "the Mount of Forgivene&s;s." It is about two miles in circum|ference&mdash;a mo&s;t delicious &s;pot. On it ADAM and EVE met, after the LORD had, for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, &s;eparated them forty years. Here they cohabited and lived in exce&s;s of happine&s;s, having built a hou&s;e on it, called "Beith Adam," that is to &s;ay, "the Hou&s;e of Adam." On the eve of the day of Sacrifice, the

three caravans, ranged in a triangular from, &s;urround this mountain&mdash;during the whole night the people rejoice, clamour, and riot&mdash;firing off cannon, mu&s;kets, pi&s;tols, and fire-works, with an ince&s;&s;ant &s;ound of drums and trumpets. As &s;oon as day breaks, a pro|found &s;ilence &s;ucceeds&mdash;they &s;lay their &s;heep and offer up their &s;acrifice on the mountain with every demon|&s;tration of the mo&s;t profound devotion.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden a &s;cheik (or head of the temple), a kind of prelate, ru&s;hes from amid&s;t them, mounted on a camel&mdash;he a&s;cends five &s;teps, rendered practicable for the purpo&s;e, and in a &s;tudied &s;ermon preaches thus to the people:</P>
<P>"Return prai&s;e and thanks for the infinite and immen&s;e benefits granted by GOD to Mahomedans, through the mediation of his mo&s;t beloved friend and prophet, Mahomet: for that he has delivered them from the &s;lavery and bondage of &s;in and idolatry, in which they were plunged; has given them the Hou&s;e of Abraham, from whence they can be heard, and their petitions granted; al&s;o the mountain of for|givene&s;s, by which they can implore Him, and obtain a pardon and remi&s;&s;ion of all their &s;ins.</P>
<P>"For that the ble&s;&s;ed, pious, and merciful GOD, giver of all good gifts, commanded his &s;ecretary, Abraham, to build him&s;elf a hou&s;e at Mecca, whence his defendants might pray to the Almighty, and their de&s;ires be fulfilled.</P>
<P>"On this command all the mountains in the world ran, as it were, each ambitious to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Secretary of the LORD, and to furni&s;h a &s;tone towards erecting the holy hou&s;e; all, except this poor little mountain, which, through mere indigence, could not contribute a &s;tone. It continued therefore thirty years greviou&s;ly afflicted: at length the Eternal GOD ob&s;erved its angui&s;h, and, moved with pity at its long &s;uffering, broke forth, &s;aying, I can forbear no longer, my child!

"Cuckold Frank!" which frequently followed us for the length of a &s;treet. Sometimes we went of even|ings to &s;ome of the outlets, where preparation was made for our reception by &s;ervants, previou&s;ly di&s;|patched for the purpo&s;e, and there regaled with cof|fee, wine, fruits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day we went on a party of the la&s;t men|tioned kind, Mrs. &mdash; did us the honour to ac|company us: the place appointed was in a range of beautiful rural gardens that lie along the &s;ide of a river; where the well cultivated earth teeming with a va&s;t abundance of the be&s;t e&s;culent plants, flowers, flowering &s;hrubs and fruit-trees, afforded a mo&s;t deli|cious regale to the &s;en&s;es; and the plane, the willow, the a&s;h, the pomegranate, and a variety of other trees, clu&s;tered together in almo&s;t impervious thickets, yielded a delightful &s;hady retreat from the piercing rays of the &s;un. It was on this occa&s;ion that I got the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of Turki&s;h illiberality, which, as I was entirely unprepared for it, confounded me, and nearly deprived me of temper and of prudence. As we walked along, I ob&s;erved &s;everal Turks addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to Mrs. &mdash; and me, who walked arm in arm, and &s;peaking with a loudne&s;s of voice, contor|tion of countenance, and violence of ge&s;ticulation, at|tended with a clapping of hands, which, though I did not under&s;tand their language, I could plainly per|ceive carried the appearance of menace or in&s;ult. I was at a lo&s;s what to think of it: Mrs. &mdash; blu&s;hed, and &s;eemed much hurt: Mr. &mdash; and the other gentlemen were &s;ilent, and betrayed not the lea&s;t mark of emotion or re&s;entment. At length, when we got from them, I a&s;ked what it meant? and was told, that it was all aimed at Mrs. &mdash;, or at lea&s;t occa&s;ioned by her: that, bigoted to the cu&s;toms of their own country, and utterly ignorant of tho&s;e of any other, they were affected with great indigna|tion
<PB N="204" REF="031911_0200_0FEF4AD70D48E4E8">
at her dre&s;s, occa&s;ional derangement of her veil, and, above all, at the &s;hamele&s;s and unpardonably wicked circum&s;tance of a woman walking &s;o openly and familiarly in the company of men. Talking of this affair afterwards with Mr. &mdash;, the lady's hu&s;band, he a&s;&s;ured me, that there was not an oppro|brious and infamous epithet which the vulgar inge|nuity of the brighte&s;t quean in Billing&s;gate could think of, that they had not huddled upon us. I was beyond mea&s;ure a&s;toni&s;hed at the coolne&s;s with which he bore it, and &s;aid, that if I had under&s;tood what they had &s;aid, I &s;hould mo&s;t certainly have been un|able to re&s;train my&s;elf, and would have knocked one of them down as an example to the re&s;t. Had you done &s;o, returned he, you would certainly have re|pented it: for, if you e&s;caped being &s;toned, or put to death upon the &s;pot, the legal puni&s;hment for an in|fidel &s;triking a true believer, you could not e&s;cape; and probably we, and all the Franks in the city, would &s;uffer for it: it would at all events cau&s;e a dreadful convul&s;ion in the place, and you would your|&s;elf fall a &s;acrifice to it.</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince I was conver&s;ing on this &s;ubject with a gentleman of my acquaintance, and mentioned it with &s;ome a&s;perity, as ari&s;ing from a &s;pirit of bigotry peculiar to Mahomedans.&mdash;"My good Sir," &s;aid he, "let me undeceive you! the very &s;ame would be done in mo&s;t parts of Spain. I was one day," continued he, "walking in a town in Spain, in company with the wife of a gentleman who re&s;ided there, who were both well known, and bore the mo&s;t unexceptionable character. Seeing me however walking with her, the populace, as we pa&s;&s;ed, held up two fingers &s;ignifi|cantly, and cried to her, What a cuckold is your hu&s;|band! and concluded with 'Todas las Ingle&s;as &s;on putas,' or, 'All Engli&s;h women are &mdash;s." He added, "that he was even in Cadiz, where commer|cial

Prote&s;tante! Puerco! Voia al los Infernos!!' In Engli&s;h&mdash;Do you believe in this? Do you believe in this? No! No! Ah Jew! Moor! Barbarian! Prote&s;tant! Hog! Go to Hell!!"</P>
<P>So much for human beneficence and charity, un|der the fo&s;tering au&s;pices of religion!</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Mr. &mdash;, where I was &s;o ho&s;pi|tably lodged, was a magnificent edifice, built in all the fulne&s;s of Ea&s;tern grandeur and luxury, and fur|ni&s;hed with all the &s;plendour and &s;tate of Turkey, united with the ta&s;te and opulence of Great Britain. It was indeed a hou&s;e in which voluptuou&s;ne&s;s it&s;elf might &s;it down with &s;atisfaction&mdash;The mo&s;t unaffected ho&s;pitality and generous benevolence invited and &s;pread the board, and politene&s;s and affability pre&s;ided over all. Never &s;hall I forget it&mdash;never &s;hall I think of it without gratitude and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>A gentleman of the opulence and con&s;equence of Mr. &mdash;, with a hou&s;e &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed, and a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ocial enjoyment, was not, you will conclude, without a re&s;ort of company and friends; in truth, he had friends even among the better &s;ort of Turks. Parties of plea&s;ure had no in|termi&s;&s;ion while I was there; and as the ladies of Eu|rope or of European extraction in that country are highly accompli&s;hed, &s;peak many languages, are inde|fatigable in their efforts to plea&s;e, and receive &s;tran|gers from Europe with a joy and &s;atisfaction not to be de&s;cribed, Aleppo would have been to me an Ely|&s;ium, if the plea&s;ures of the place did not from the beginning &s;uffer diminution from my own painful &s;en|&s;ations,
<PB N="206" REF="031911_0202_0FEF4ADB5C6A6A00">
which were aggravated at la&s;t by an incident that aro&s;e from my intercour&s;e there&mdash;of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>While I remained at Aleppo, I walked, as I before told you, frequently about the &s;treets; and I think I never was witne&s;s to &s;o many broils in all my life put together, as I was in my wanderings there&mdash;Not a time I went out that I did not ob&s;erve one, two, three, and &s;ometimes half a dozen or more. They have nothing terrible in them however, and, were it not extremely di&s;gu&s;ting to &s;ee men &s;cold, would be very entertaining; for I will venture to &s;ay that a &s;treet battle "&agrave; la Turque" is one of the mo&s;t ludi|crous exhibitions in the world. The parties approach to each other, and retreat mutually, as the action of the one gives hopes to the other of victory, lifting their hands, and flouri&s;hing them in the air, as if ready to &s;trike every moment, grinning and gna&s;hing their teeth, while their beard and whi&s;kers be&s;prent with the &s;pume of their mouths, and wagging with the quick motion of their lips and gha&s;tly contortions of their jaws, pre&s;ent the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;pectacle imagi|nable. They reminded me at the time of a ver&s;e in an old Engli&s;h ballad:&mdash;
<Q><L>'Tis merry in the hall,</L>
<L>When beards wag all.</L></Q></P>
<P>Nothing, in fact, can exceed the extravagance of their ge&s;ture: the vehement loudne&s;s of their voice, or the whim&s;ical di&s;tortions of their countenances, in which are di&s;played &s;ometimes the quicke&s;t vici&s;&s;itudes of fear and fury, and &s;ometimes the mo&s;t laughable combination of both. All this time, however, not a &s;ingle blow is actually &s;truck; but they compen&s;ate for the want of bodily prowe&s;s by the exerci&s;e of the tongue, denouncing vengeance again&s;t each other, threatening in&s;tant demolition, lavi&s;hing every bitter
<PB N="207" REF="031911_0203_0FEF4ADE1AE8F638">
reproach, every filthy epithet, and every horrible im|precation that they can think of, and both boa&s;ting occa&s;ionally of their patience and forbearance, which fortunately enabled them to refrain from annihilating their adver&s;ary. At la&s;t the fray gradually decays: exhau&s;ted with fatigue, and half choaked with du&s;t and vociferation, they retreat gradually backwards to their own doors; where &s;umming up all their malig|nity into a mo&s;t horrid execration, they part for the time, and retire to vaunt in empty threat, and growl away their rage, in the rece&s;&s;es of their haram.</P>
<P>Yet tho&s;e people are found terrible in battle by the Chri&s;tian troops that have from time to time been op|po&s;ed to them: here, if proof be wanting of the ef|fects of religion on the human mind, is an incontrover|tible one of its powerful operations. Under the in|fluence of their faith, which tells them that they go to Paradi&s;e in&s;tantly if killed in battle with Infidels, they perform prodigies of valour fighting again&s;t Chri&s;tians; while, forbidden by that faith to imbrue their hands in the blood of a true believer, their pa&s;|&s;ions have been gradually brought under the dominion of their religion, till that which at fir&s;t was faith at la&s;t becomes habit, and the appropriate energy and courage of the man has &s;unk into the degrading and ema&s;culant efforts of the woman.</P>
<P>The practice of fighting, or per&s;onal conflicts be|tween individuals of the &s;ame &s;ociety, &s;eems to have been condemned by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of all reli|gions. The Gentoos, as well as all the other &s;ects of the various parts of the Ea&s;t through which I have travelled, give vent to their pa&s;&s;ion in nearly the &s;ame manner as the Turks. The Chri&s;tians too are mo&s;t &s;trictly forbidden to &s;trike one another by the great Author of their faith: but it is their good fortune, that they not only have the be&s;t religion in the world for their guidance, but that they are the only people
<PB N="208" REF="031911_0204_0FEF4AE0D81DBC90">
in the world who claim exemption from the penalties of that religion, and think them&s;elves wronged and their per&s;onal rights infringed, if they are refu&s;ed the privilege of breaking through its rules whenever tho&s;e rules are at variance with their convenience.</P>
<P>Be it your care, my dear child, to fortify your mind with the &s;pirit of true religion and &s;ound mora|lity, and let your practice in life be ever guided by their precepts.</P>

<P>THE avidity with which human creatures &s;earch for &s;omething to recreate the mind and keep it in exerci&s;e, is of it&s;elf a convincing proof of the natu|ral activity of our intellectual faculties, and &s;hews that, like the different parts of the body, they were given by Providence to be called into effort and im|proved by practice. As they who by the favours of opulence are exempted from the nece&s;&s;ity of actual bodily labour, are obliged to have recour&s;e to artifi|cial labour called exerci&s;e; &s;o they who have the mis|fortune to be precluded from the employment of the mind by bu&s;ine&s;s, are obliged to &s;eek mental exerci&s;e in a variety of expedients, &s;ome of which are crimi|nal, &s;ome fooli&s;h, and &s;ome good for nothing or indif|ferent. Cards, dice, and games of chance are (ac|cording to the extent to which they are carried) of the two former&mdash;tale and novel-reading of the two latter. Tho&s;e however &s;erve to occupy the vacant

hours of all the idle and unemployed. And when letters deny their friendly aid, we find among our|&s;elves the deficiency &s;upplied from the le&s;s ample re|&s;ources of the memory; and &s;tory-telling, love tales, fairy tales, and goblin and gho&s;t adventures, are reci|ted round the villager's fire or the kitchen hearth in as great numbers, with as much ingenuity, and to as great effect, as they are to be found written in the innumerable volumes on the &s;helves of our circulating libraries.</P>
<P>In Turkey, where the art of printing has not yet been known, where the circulation of literary produc|tions is chained down within the narrow compa&s;s of manu&s;cript, and where therefore the efforts of genius are repre&s;&s;ed by di&s;couragement, the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;tory-telling makes in it&s;elf a profe&s;&s;ion, which, as it is ac|quired by &s;tudy and pro&s;ecuted with art, is followed with con&s;iderable profit.</P>
<P>One day a friend (a French gentleman) who e&s;|corted me through the town, called to draw me out with him for a walk; he &s;aid he wi&s;hed to &s;hew me &s;ome of the caravan&s;eras, ob&s;erving that he thought I &s;hould be entertained with a view of them. I agreed to go; and he brought me to two, which, after he had &s;hewn to me and explained their principle, police, and etiquette, I could not help admiring and ap|proving. To both the&s;e were attached eating-hou&s;es and coffee-hou&s;es, and every appendage that could render them convenient and comfortable. As we were about leaving the la&s;t, I ob&s;erved my friend &s;top and li&s;ten attentively. "Come hither," &s;aid he, after a minute's pau&s;e&mdash;"come into this coffee-hou&s;e, here is &s;omething going forward that may amu&s;e you."</P>
<P>We accordingly entered the coffee-hou&s;e, where we &s;aw a number of people, &s;ome &s;eated in the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion, &s;ome on low &s;tools, and &s;ome &s;tanding; and in the middle a man walking to and fro, &s;peaking in
<PB N="210" REF="031911_0206_0FEF4AE6D230F3B0">
an audible voice, &s;ometimes &s;lowly, &s;ometimes with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">idity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arying his tones occa&s;ionally with all the in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions of a corre&s;ponding &s;en&s;e. I could not under|&s;tand him, but he &s;eemed to me to &s;peak with "good empha&s;is and good di&s;cretion:" his action was ea&s;y to him, though expre&s;&s;ive and emphatical; and his coun|tenance exhibited &s;trong marks of eloquent expre&s;&s;ion. I could not help &s;taring with a&s;toni&s;hment at a &s;cene &s;o new to me, and felt great approbation of the tones and manner of this extraordinary orator, though I could not under&s;tand a &s;ingle word he &s;aid. He was li&s;tened to by all with great attention, and the Turks (albeit not u&s;ed to the laughing mood) frequently be|trayed &s;trong &s;ymptoms of ri&s;ibility: but in the height and torrent of his &s;peech he broke &s;uddenly off, &s;campered out of the door and di&s;appeared. I &s;et it down that he was a maniac or lunatic of an ingenious kind, and was for going away. "Stay," &s;ays my friend, "re&s;t where you are for a few minutes, let us hear further."</P>
<P>The orator had &s;carcely been gone three minutes when the room was filled with the buzz of conver&s;a|tion, a word of which I could not under&s;tand, but which my guide li&s;tened to very attentively. At length the buzz began to grow loud, and &s;oon in|crea&s;ed into clamour; when a &s;cene en&s;ued of &s;o very ludicrous a kind as forced me to cram my handker|chief into my mouth to &s;uppre&s;s a laugh, or at lea&s;t &s;o to &s;tifle it as to avoid ob&s;ervation. In &s;hort, they were di&s;puting violently, and the beards were, as I once before mentioned to you, ALL WAGGING. I became more convul&s;ed with mirth; and my friend &s;eeing that I was likely to give offence, took me under the arm and hurried me out of the coffee-hou&s;e: we retired into a porch in the caravan&s;era, where I gave vent to my &s;uppre&s;&s;ed laughter till my &s;ides were &s;ore and my eyes ran tears.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="031911_0207_0FEF4AEA23A54268">"In the name of God, my friend!" &s;aid I, "tell me what is the meaning of all that extravagant &s;cene to which we have ju&s;t now been witne&s;s: who is that madman that &s;poke &s;o much? and why did they all quarrel after he went away?"</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid he, "let us retire to my hou&s;e, and I will there explain the whole of it to you, from beginning to ending."</P>
<P>I accordingly accompanied him home, where we found a very gay circle a&s;&s;embled, to whom he de|&s;cribed my a&s;toni&s;hment; recounting my immoderate laughter, till they all laughed very nearly as immode|rately as my&s;elf. "You mu&s;t know," &s;aid he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, "that he whom you took to be a madman, is one of the mo&s;t celebrated compo|&s;ers and tellers of &s;tories in A&s;ia, and only wants the aid of printing, to be perhaps as eminent in reputa|tion for making CONTES, as Marmontel or Madame D'Anois. As we pa&s;&s;ed along I heard his voice, and, knowing it, re&s;olved to let you &s;ee him, and brought you in for the purpo&s;e. He was entertaining the company with a very curious, intere&s;ting, and comical &s;tory; the &s;ubject of which was avarice; the hero a mi&s;er of the name of Ca&s;&s;em. His mi&s;ery and ava|rice are repre&s;ented in it as bringing him into a va|riety of &s;crapes, which wa&s;te his wealth; and his character is drawn with &s;uch &s;trength of colouring, and marked with &s;uch grote&s;que lines of humour&mdash;he related it moreover with &s;o much wit, in &s;uch admi|rable language, and embelli&s;hed and enforced it with &s;uch appropriate action, utterance, and empha&s;is&mdash;that it riveted, as you &s;aw, the attention of all his auditors, and extorted laughter even from Turki&s;h gravity,"</P>
<P>"But how came he to break off &s;o &s;uddenly?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"That," returned my friend, "is a part of the art of his profe&s;&s;ion, without which he could not live:
<PB N="212" REF="031911_0208_0FEF4AEDA178B5D8">
ju&s;t as he gets to a mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of the &s;tory, when he has wound the imagination of his auditors up to the highe&s;t climax of expectation, he purpo&s;ely breaks off to make them eager for the re&s;t. He is &s;ure to have them all next day, with additional numbers who come on their report, and he makes his terms to fini&s;h the &s;tory."</P>
<P>"Why then," interrupted I, "why did they who remained behind fall di&s;puting?"</P>
<P>"That I will explain to you," &s;aid he. Ju&s;t as he broke off, Ca&s;&s;em the mi&s;er (who, as far as I heard, &s;eems as well drawn as Moliere's AVA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">) having already &s;uffered a thou&s;and whim&s;ical misfor|tunes and dilapidations of fortune, is brought before the cadi for digging in his garden, on the pre&s;ump|tion that he was digging for trea&s;ure. As &s;oon as the hi&s;torian was gone, they fir&s;t applauded him, and then began to di&s;cu&s;s his &s;tory&mdash;which they one and all agreed in prai&s;ing highly and when they came to talk of the probable i&s;&s;ue of the &s;equel of it, there were almo&s;t as many opinions as there were men in company; each maintained his own, and they went to loggerheads as you &s;aw about it&mdash;when the chance is a thou&s;and to one, that not one of them was near the mark. One in particular &s;urmi&s;ed that Ca&s;&s;em would be married to the cadi's daughter; which gave great offence to &s;ome, and rou&s;ed another of the company to declare, that he was well a&s;&s;ured in his con&s;cience that Ca&s;&s;em would be brought to the ba&s;tinado or the &s;take, or el&s;e hanged, in the &s;equel."</P>
<P>"And is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid I, "that a group of twenty or thirty rational beings can be &s;o far bereft of all common &s;en&s;e, as to di&s;pute upon the re&s;ult of a contigency, which ab&s;olutely depends on the arbitrary fancy of an acknowledged fabricator of fal&s;e|hoods?"</P>

<P>"But we will go again to-morrow," continued he, "probably he will be there to conclude or proceed further with his &s;tory;" I agreed to this and we parted.</P>
<P>On the next day we went, and not &s;eeing the orator in his place, lounged about the caravan&s;era, and going to another coffee-hou&s;e found him de|claiming with all his might.

<P>MY la&s;t letter has &s;hewn you, that the con|ceptions of genius, though they may want the aid of the pre&s;s to bring them in full and perfect di&s;|clo&s;ure to the world, will yet bur&s;t through their bounds, and find &s;ome means of communication with mankind; for though the art of printing be unknown in Turkey, the emanations of &s;uperior intellect and fancy find their way to the general ear through the medium of public declamation in coffee-hou&s;es.

<P>The French gentleman whom I mentioned to you in my la&s;t, as having procured me that plea&s;ant repa&s;t at the coffee-hou&s;e, called on me a morning or two after that, and reminded me how highly I &s;eemed to be entertained; &s;aid, there were often to be &s;een, by walking about and going into public places, a variety of things, which however worthle&s;s and un|entertaining

<P>You will conclude that I readily complied, and we &s;allied out directly in que&s;t of adventure. We proceeded, therefore, to one of the beforementioned coffee-hou&s;es, where, as my friend ob&s;erved to me, though there were no people of great rank, there was generally &s;omething to afford contemplation or amu&s;ement; and where, if nothing el&s;e occured, the motley appearance of the company was &s;ufficient to excite a variety of whim&s;ical emotions, and &s;ug|ge&s;t numberle&s;s ludicrous images to the imagination of an Engli&s;h or French man. As there was no orator at work declaiming, I had time to indulge my&s;elf with a more accurate view than I had before taken of the group that &s;urrounded us: and &s;urely never was ponderous gravity more ludicrou&s;ly, or in more various forms depicted by any caricaturi&s;t in the world.&mdash;Here it was to be &s;een, in all its &s;hadings, from the &s;elf-important nod of &s;erious cogitation, down to the &s;oporific a&s;pect of &s;tolid &s;tupidity. Not a mu&s;cle was moved in way of mirth, not a face di&s;graced with a &s;mile, and I could not help think|ing all the time, that if every nation of the earth was to take &s;ome animal for its in&s;ignia, as the Briti&s;h a&s;&s;ume the lion, and the Pru&s;&s;ian the eagle, the Turks might be divided in their choice between the appropriate claims of the owl and the a&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after we entered, a band of what they called mu&s;ic, &s;truck up a concert. And here again the notion of the owl and the a&s;s &s;truck me with increa|&s;ed
<PB N="216" REF="031911_0212_0FEF4AF58F7B9F80">
force, as peculiarly pre&s;iding over their mu&s;ic: for no other combination of &s;ounds that I know on earth, but the &s;creeching of the one, and the braying of the other, could form any thing to re&s;emble this concert, with which the aditory &s;eemed va&s;tly plea&s;ed, though I was obliged to betake my&s;elf to flight, in order to get relief from the torture it give me. The Turks, however, as I retreated, honoured me with a few remarks, which as I did not under&s;tand, I could not preci&s;ely feel; my friend however told me, they were to the effect that we were Frangi Dumus (Frank Hog), and had no more ear than that filthy animal for mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid my friend, don't be di&s;couraged!&mdash;But the mu&s;ic&mdash;the mu&s;ic! interrupted I.&mdash;Well then, &s;aid he, the mu&s;ic, or rather the &s;ounds were execrable to be &s;ure; they have at lea&s;t &s;erved to e&s;tabli&s;h this certainty, that there is nothing, however di&s;cord|ant or dete&s;table, which habit will not reconcile us to. Doubt not, &s;aid he, that the be&s;t piece of Handel or Correlli, performed by the be&s;t band in Rome, would appear as ridiculous to them, as their concert did to us.</P>
<P>We vi&s;ited many coffee-hou&s;es in the cour&s;e of that day, in every one of which we found &s;omething to divert or di&s;gu&s;t us; at length as we entered one, my friendly guide turning to me with &s;atisfaction in his countenance, &s;aid "Here is &s;omething about to go forward that will plea&s;e you better than the concert of mu&s;ic." What is it &s;aid I? A drama, returned he; a drama, to you mo&s;t certainly of a new and extra|ordinary kind; and I do a&s;&s;ure you that &s;o zealous am I to procure you entertainment, I would rather than a couple of louis' you could under&s;tand what is going forward: your hearty mirth and laughter, added he, are &s;ufficient to put one in &s;pirits. He then directed my attention to a fellow who was bu&s;ily em|ployed
<PB N="217" REF="031911_0213_0FEF4AFA5D07E280">
in erecting a &s;tage, which he accompli&s;hed in a time incredibly &s;hort. The light of the &s;un was completely excluded, and a puppet &s;hew commenced, which gave great delight to all the audience, and ig|norant as I was of the language, plea&s;ed me very much.</P>
<P>I was a&s;toni&s;hed when informed that one man only &s;poke for all the per&s;onages of the drama, for &s;o artfully did he change his tone of voice, that I could have &s;worn there had been as many people to &s;peak, as there were characters in the piece. The images were not actually puppets, commonly &s;o called, but &s;hadows done in the manner of A&s;tley's <HI>Ombres Chi|noi&s;es.</HI> They were, however, far inferior to his in execution and management, though the dialogue and incident evidently appeared even to me, to be executed with a degree of the <HI>vis comica</HI> far &s;upe|rior to any I ever &s;aw in a thing of the kind in Europe; indeed &s;o perfect was the whole, that though I knew not a word of the language, I comprehended clearly the plan of the piece, and many of the &s;trokes of humour contained in the dialogues.&mdash;The plan was obviou&s;ly taken from a &s;tory which I have read in &s;ome of the Ea&s;tern tales, I believe the Arabian Nights Entertainments, and it is founded on the law of the country, that a man may repudiate his wife twice, and take her back again; but in the event of a third divorce, cannot retake her to his marriage-bed, unle&s;s &s;he be previou&s;ly married and divorced by another man. To obviate which, hu&s;bands who repent having divorced their wives a third time, employ a man to marry them, and re&s;tore her back again; and he who does this office is called a <HI>Hullah.</HI>&mdash;In the piece before us, however, the Lady and the Hullah like each other &s;o well, that they agree not to &s;eparate; the hu&s;band brings them both before the cadi to enforce a &s;epara|tion; and the &s;cene before the cadi was as ludicrous,
<PB N="218" REF="031911_0214_0FEF4AFBEED1CF30">
and as keen a &s;atire upon tho&s;e magi&s;trates as can well be conceived, though of the low kind.</P>
<P>The piece was introduced with a grand nuptial proce&s;&s;ion, in which the ma&s;ter di&s;played the powers of his voice by uttering a variety of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite tones in the whole gamut of the human voice; &s;ome|times &s;peaking, &s;ometimes &s;queaking like a hurt child, &s;ometimes huzzaing as a man, a woman, or a child; &s;ometimes neighing like a hor&s;e, and &s;ometimes in|ter&s;per&s;ing it with other &s;uch &s;ounds as commonly occur in crowds, in &s;uch a manner as a&s;toni&s;hed me: while the concomitant action of the images, grote&s;que be|yond mea&s;ure, kept up the laugh; hor&s;es kicking and throwing their riders, a&s;&s;es biting tho&s;e near them, and kicking tho&s;e behind them, who retire limping in the mo&s;t ridiculous manner; while their great &s;tanding character in all pieces, KARA-GHUSE (the &s;ame as our Punch), rai&s;ed a general roar of ob&s;treperous mirth even from the Turks, with his whim&s;ical action, of which I mu&s;t &s;ay that, though non&s;e&s;ical, though indecent, and &s;ometimes even di&s;gu&s;ting, it was on the whole the mo&s;t fini&s;hed compo&s;ition of low ribaldry and fun that I ever beheld.</P>
<P>When they come before the cadi, he is &s;eated in his divan of ju&s;tice; but as &s;oon as the complaint is opened and an&s;wered, he ri&s;es and comes forward be|tween the contending parties: here he turns to one and demands in a terrific tone what he has to &s;ay, while the other puts ca&s;h in his hand behind, and in proportion as the ca&s;h is counted in, increa&s;es the terror of his voice; he then pockets the money, and again turns to the other, and demands what he has to offer, while in like manner he receives the bribes from his ad|ver&s;ary and puts it in an oppo&s;ite pocket: this alternate application la&s;ts till the pur&s;es of both are exhau&s;ted, when, giving a great groan, he retires on one &s;ide to reckon the money of each from a pocket he has on

either &s;ide, one called plaintiff, and the other defend|ant; when balancing them, he finds plaintiff better by one a&s;per (or three-halfpence) than defendant, and pronounces his judgment accordingly. The de|fendant appeals to the ba&s;haw; they go before him: KARA-GHUSE (Punch) however, takes the defendant a&s;ide, and in a dialogue, which my friend a&s;&s;ured me was pointed, witty, and bitterly &s;atirical, developes to him the whole &s;y&s;ten of magi&s;tratical inju&s;tice, advi&s;es him to bribe the ba&s;haw, and declaring his zeal for all young people fond of amorous en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oy|ment (which he is at &s;ome pains to enlarge upon to the exce&s;s of indelicacy), offers him the aid of his pur&s;e. The advice is followed; the bribe is accepted; the cadi's decree is rever&s;ed, and him&s;elf di&s;graced, and the mob at once hu&s;tle him and bear the Hullah home to his bride with clamours of joy. Here again the ma&s;ter &s;hewed his extraordinary powers, giving not only, is before, di&s;tinct and oppo&s;ite tones of voice, but huddling a number of different &s;ounds with &s;uch &s;kill and rapidity together, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the per&s;ua&s;ion that they were the i&s;&s;ue of a large and tumultuous crowd of men and animals. With this extravagant <HI>melange</HI> the curtain dropped, and the performance ended.</P>
<P>Returning home we conver&s;ed together on the &s;ub|ject of the piece, which I confe&s;s I could not get out of my head for &s;ome time. My friend explained to me, as well as he could recollect, a great part of the dialogue, and a&s;&s;ured me, that the freedom of &s;peech of Mon&s;ieur KARA-GHUSE had from time to time created a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s, not only to private offending individuals, but to the magi&s;tracy it|&s;elf&mdash;that no offender, however intrenched behind power, or en&s;hrined in rank, could e&s;cape him&mdash;that ba&s;haws, cadis, nay the Jani&s;&s;aries them&s;elves, were often made the &s;port of his fury; that he was not

more re&s;trained in the effu&s;ions of ob&s;cenity which he uttered, than in his &s;atire; that he was always well received and applauded, even venerated (as we vene|rate the liberty of the pre&s;s) as a bold teller of truth, who with little mi&s;chief does a great deal of good, and often rou&s;es the lethargic public mind to a &s;en&s;e of public dangers and injuries. He added, that in &s;ome ca&s;es the magi&s;trate had been obliged to interfere; and the ba&s;haw him&s;elf was &s;eriou&s;ly called upon at times to &s;top the licentious tongue of this champion of freedom, KARA-GHUSE.</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid I, "it appears upon the whole that Mon&s;ieur KARA-GHUSE is a very great black|guard, but a very witty, and a very hone&s;t one."</P>
<P>"You have ju&s;t hit it," &s;aid he; "and if Ma&s;ter Kara-ghu&s;e was to take &s;uch liberties in France, Spain, Portugal, or Germany, all his wit and hone&s;ty would not &s;ave him from puni&s;hment. In England you do not want him; every man there is a KARA-GHUSE, and every new&s;paper a puppet-&s;hew."</P>
<P>"And yet," returned I, "we complain &s;adly of want of liberty!"</P>
<P>"That is natural," returned my &s;agacious French|man, "perfectly natural. Liberty is like money; the more we have of it, the more covetous we grow."</P>
<P>"Very true, Mon&s;ieur," &s;aid I, plea&s;ed with his compliment to our happy con&s;titution, and to clinch his ob&s;ervation, gave a Latin quotation, which when a child I got out of Lilly's Grammar, "Cre&s;cit amor nummi, quantum ip&s;a pecunia cre&s;cit;" and then changing nummus for libertas, "Cre&s;cit amor liber|tatis, quantum ip&s;a libertas cre&s;cit."</P>
<P>"'Tis very well, Mon&s;ieur," &s;aid he; "and to carry on your allu&s;ion, may we not &s;ay, that they who do not know when they have enough, are as danger|ou&s;ly wrong in the one ca&s;e, as tho&s;e who &s;ay we have too much, are in the other? The Engli&s;h com|plaining

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I was, in the manner I have already mentioned, endeavouring to pa&s;s away the time as cheerfully as po&s;&s;ible, till a caravan was formed, or Company's di&s;patches were coming over land, of which I might avail my&s;elf; I found my &s;ituation in the hou&s;e of Mr. &mdash; growing extremely critical. That gentleman, of who&s;e good &s;en&s;e, and truly ex|cellent di&s;po&s;ition, I had too manifold proofs to call them in que&s;tion, had, though fallen into the vale of years, married his lady at a very tender age. She was then young, beautiful, full of &s;en&s;ibility, and gifted with &s;uch natural endowments both of mind and per&s;on, accompanied with all tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which helped to dre&s;s them to advantage, that &s;he might well be acquitted of vanity, even though fancy &s;ugge&s;ted to her &s;he was fit to grace and confer hap|pine&s;s on a younger bed; while reflection on the ob|vious di&s;parity of the match (which the cool temper of &s;atiety po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;ted to him) might perhaps have alarmed his mind to circum&s;tances of probable danger, that, before wedlock, were all hid behind the deceptive veil of pa&s;&s;ion. Whether the&s;e were the
<PB N="222" REF="031911_0218_0FEF4B075F375928">
private &s;entiments that influenced both or either of them, I cannot pre&s;ume to determine, though I think it probable: for I was not long in the hou&s;e till I plainly perceived they were on a very bad footing with each other, and in &s;hort that di&s;agreement was become habitual to them. At fir&s;t, that is to &s;ay, for a few days after my becoming an inmate of their hou&s;e, decency enforced concealment, and the ebulli|tions of peevi&s;hne&s;s were &s;tifled by the dictates of prudence: but the animo&s;ities of the connubial &s;tate are tho&s;e which of all others are the mo&s;t impatient under control; and as time, by producing familia|rity, relaxed re&s;traint, the pent-up pa&s;&s;ions began to force their way, and open bickering took place in my pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>It is but barely doing ju&s;tice to my&s;elf to &s;ay, that I felt the mo&s;t poignant concern at &s;eeing a couple; each &s;o perfectly amiable in all other re&s;pects, bla&s;t|ing the hours that &s;hould be given to harmony and love, in jarring reproach, and recrimination; and I would have given all I was worth that I had never had occa&s;ion to e&s;teem them &s;o much, or that I could give them that peace which &s;eemed to have flown them for ever. Fain would I ca&s;t a veil over the whole tran&s;action; fain would I bury it, even from my&s;elf, in oblivion: but it has been made by my enemies the &s;ubject of triumphant &s;lander; and to do ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, and di&s;claim the extent of guilt which they would impute to me, I am reluctantly obliged to avow the &s;hare I had, and declare how the matter really &s;tood. I mu&s;t &s;peak the truth, and hope you will not conceive that I de&s;ignedly lean too heavily upon any one, to ea&s;e my&s;elf of my &s;hare of the load.</P>
<P>Whate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er dome&s;tic unea&s;ine&s;s may &s;ub&s;i&s;t between a married pair, the man, if prudent, will endeavour to conceal it; and the woman, if truly virtuous, will take care to do &s;o: &s;hould great di&s;parity of age (as in the
<PB N="223" REF="031911_0219_0FEF4B0AB58A8B00">
pre&s;ent in&s;tance) be the ca&s;e, the lady is more particu|larly bound to conceal any unea&s;ine&s;s, le&s;t it &s;hould be attributed to that cau&s;e which people are in &s;uch ca&s;es too prone to &s;u&s;pect, di&s;like to her hu&s;band; and before young men, above all, &s;he &s;hould be mo&s;t ex|emplary, as &s;he mu&s;t well know that their natural va|nity, combined with the leading idea of her aver&s;ion and infidelity to her hu&s;band, &s;ugge&s;t ideas to them from whence their warm imaginations draw inferences of a nature too plea&s;ing to be parted with, and too probable not to be put in practice, or at lea&s;t at|tempted. Here then a woman at once lays her&s;elf fairly open to the a&s;&s;aults of illicit love&punc; I think it will not be denied, that the woman who promulgates the di&s;agreements between her and her hu&s;band, par|ticularly if &s;he &s;uffers a young man to be privy to it, is either extremely ignorant, or intentionally vicious, or both.</P>
<P>That the lady I allude to may in &s;ome re&s;pect be acquitted of this imputation, I mu&s;t tell you, that &s;he was only eighteen years of age; her tender, inexpe|rienced mind had not yet arrived to that maturity which gives &s;ound judgment; and though of good natural talents, highly cultivated (for &s;he &s;poke flu|ently Engli&s;h, French, Italian, Arabic, Per&s;ian, and the Greek and Turki&s;h languages), &s;he yet was &s;im|ple, innocent, uninformed in the ways of the world, and incapable of rea&s;oning from cau&s;es up to con&s;e|quences. But unfortunately that &s;implicity is at|tended with as much mi&s;chief, though not guilt, as the wilful mi&s;conduct of the more experienced; it has the &s;ame baleful effects with the hearers, in&s;pires the &s;ame confidence, emboldens with the &s;ame hopes, and leads to the &s;ame pernicious practices.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned, and will now remind you, that I was then young. Perhaps it was owing to a congeniality pointed out by our age, perhaps to
<PB N="224" REF="031911_0220_0FEF4B0C9FE1DD80">
a compa&s;&s;ionate politene&s;s amounting to tenderne&s;s, which I always di&s;clo&s;ed on tho&s;e unhappy occa&s;ions, joined perhaps to the ardent look of youth kindled by the imaginations to which this imprudent conduct in|&s;en&s;ibly gave birth, that the lady thought proper to take the very hazardous &s;tep of making a confidant of a young man and a &s;oldier&mdash;and revealing to me the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tale of her grievances, with a pathetic elo|quence, that would have made an impre&s;&s;ion upon a much le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible heart than mine. I declare it mo&s;t &s;olemnly, that though this extraordinary mark of confidence and e&s;teem communicated to my heart &s;trong &s;en&s;ations of unju&s;tifiable plea&s;ure; I &s;o far got the better of my&s;elf at fir&s;t, as to receive the whole with the &s;ame appearance of tranquillity, as if I had been only a confidential female friend. I pitied&punc; it is true;&mdash;I expre&s;&s;ed my pity;&mdash;I advi&s;ed, not trea|cherou&s;ly but faithfully;&mdash;I &s;aid &s;uch things as occur|ed to me to be mo&s;t likely to a&s;&s;uage and extingui&s;h the flame of di&s;cord, and lead to an amicable adju&s;t|ment; and I parted for that time with her to go to a &s;elf-approving pillow, where, while my fancy was in|flamed and tickled by the flattering mark of regard &s;hewn me by &s;o all-accompli&s;hed a per&s;on, I had the &s;oothing delightful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having, as far as I was able, done, my duty, and e&s;caped the corroding reflection of having violated the rights of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>Not an opportunity however afterwards offered, that the &s;ame unhappy point was not the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and unfortunately tho&s;e opportunities but too frequently occurred; till at length we began to feel that they were the &s;weete&s;t minutes of our lives, and were &s;ought for with indu&s;trious avidity by both of us. No human re&s;olution was &s;ufficient to with|&s;tand &s;uch an unlucky concurrence of circum&s;tances: from lamenting the grievances, we wi&s;hed to remove them; from wi&s;hing, we proceeded to con&s;ider the
<PB N="225" REF="031911_0221_0FEF4B1140602160">
means; and when we had got that length, the flight was not far to the extreme end&mdash;the execution of it. My pa&s;&s;ions hurried me before them, my expre&s;&s;ions grew gradually more and more unguarded, our con|ver&s;ation became more intere&s;ting and warm; and though I felt and &s;truggled to be guided by the &s;trict principles of honour, and formed a thou&s;and re&s;olu|tions not to tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of ho&s;pitality, by in|juring the man who had treated me with &s;uch kind|ne&s;s, the &s;truggle became too &s;evere for me&mdash;the de|&s;ire of plea&s;ing a lovely woman, who had repo&s;ed &s;uch unbounded confidence in me, and who &s;eemed to ex|pect and require of me to alleviate her mi&s;ery, at length bore down all the oppo&s;itions &s;ugge&s;ted by rea|&s;on and principle, and I agreed to become the in&s;tru|ment of her removal from this unhappy &s;ituation. We fell&mdash;but not intirely. There is one length to which no earthly con&s;ideration&mdash;no allurement how|ever dazzling could tempt me&mdash;it is now the mo&s;t cordial con&s;olation to my mind; I never &s;uffered my|&s;elf to think of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the decorum of his hou&s;e, nor did we in any &s;ingle in&s;tance carry our in|tercour&s;e to a direct violation of his bed. Though the tran&s;ports of youthful pa&s;&s;ion hurried us into conver&s;ations and reflections on the &s;ubject of her de|termination to be &s;eparated from her hu&s;band, yet that pa&s;&s;ion was of too delicate a kind to &s;ink into the brutal &s;ordid indulgence of di&s;honourable &s;tolen em|braces. She wi&s;hed for that &s;eparation, rather as a &s;ubterfuge from ince&s;&s;ant diu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al mi&s;ery, than as a prelude to any vicious or illicit enjoyment; and we looked with plea&s;ure to the event, but we looked no further.</P>
<P>It is thus that, in the down-hill path of vice, we are hurried on &s;tep by &s;tep, fondly imagining that each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive object, which bounds our &s;ight, will &s;top our headlong career; while alas! every &s;tep we advance
<PB N="226" REF="031911_0222_0FEF4B14C5F106D0">
gives additional rapidity to our de&s;cent: like the cen|tripetal force of a projectile, our pace increa&s;es with uniformly accelerated motion&mdash;till di&s;daining all con|trol, and breaking down every impediment that rea|&s;on, morality, or honour throw in the way to re&s;cue us or retard our ruin, we precipitate unexpectedly into the la&s;t gulph of vice and infamy.</P>
<P>Fortunately, however, an accident intervened in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, which arre&s;ted our progre&s;s down this hideous de&s;cent, and re&s;erved us both I hope to con|viction of our folly, and repentance of our error. And I have the con&s;olation to reflect, that out of &s;uch a ho&s;t of dangers and temptations as I was be&s;et with, I have e&s;caped without the actual perpetration of a deed, which would, had it happened, in all probabi|lity have embittered my life.</P>
<P>While we hugged our&s;elves in the &s;ecurity and &s;e|crecy of expre&s;&s;ing our genuine &s;entiments, her hu&s;|band di&s;covered our wi&s;hes, and all at once took the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for preventing them. So that, overwhelmed with grief and &s;hame, I directly formed the re&s;olution to leave Aleppa, and proceed in the be&s;t manner I could on my de&s;tination.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, my dear FREDERICK, was your fa|ther, by failing to re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of an un|lawful and di&s;honourable pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;en&s;ibly led to the very brink of a precipice, the bare remembrance of which now makes him &s;hudder with horror. The &s;tory, by means unnece&s;&s;ary for me to mention, took wind. The folly of &s;ome, the malice of others, and the unaccountable propen&s;ity to fal&s;ehood of more, trumpeted it about with many exaggerations to my injury, and I was held up as the deliberate &s;educer of innocence: but the whole tran&s;action is exactly as I have &s;tated it; and the di&s;agreements previous to my arrival at Aleppo, which, in telling the &s;tory, they purpo&s;ely left out, were of &s;uch public notoriety, that
<PB N="227" REF="031911_0223_0FEF4B16564D1370">

Provi|dence has, for the wi&s;e&s;t of purpo&s;es, implanted in our nature a fondne&s;s for the fair &s;ex; and &s;o long as it is u&s;ed prudently and virtuou&s;ly, it con&s;titutes the fir&s;t happine&s;s of life; but if on the contrary, it &s;timulates us to exce&s;s, impels to injure our fellow-creature, or break in upon the repo&s;e of a family; it is our reproach, our &s;hame, our cur&s;e, and very fre|quently our utter and irremediable ruin; add to this, that there is in the general character of women, a ca|priciou&s;ne&s;s, a levity, and a vanity, under the influ|ence of which they &s;port with men, only to di&s;play their power, and evince the force of their charms, which makes the cultivation of their good graces in any way hazardous.

<P>As your happine&s;s, my dear boy, is the fir&s;t object of my life, my efforts &s;hall be turned to the guiding of your greener years from any premature impre&s;|&s;ions; and when rea&s;on and matured age fit you for the cultivation and enjoyment of female &s;ociety, be it mine to direct your &s;teps away from that cla&s;s, who think rank a &s;ufficient &s;anction for vice, who flare in all the bronze of ari&s;tocratic a&s;&s;urance, under a load of obloquy, beneath which the poore&s;t pea&s;ant's wife would &s;ink; who think that wealth and rank confer a right to commit exce&s;&s;es that would degrade the meane&s;t of the canaille; and felicitate them&s;elves with

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;covery to which I alluded in my la&s;t letter, &s;urpri&s;ed and grieved me very much; and in|deed it a&s;toni&s;hed me the more, from the manner in which it was communicated.</P>
<P>One day I received a polite me&s;&s;age from the Bri|ti&s;h con&s;ul, &s;aying, he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, upon a bu&s;ine&s;s of great con&s;equence. I thought at fir&s;t, that it might be &s;ome plan for my proceeding on my journey&mdash;perhaps Company's di&s;|patches that had arrived to go over land; and at in|tervals, &s;omething like apprehen&s;ions of the true mo|tive of his &s;ending for me flew acro&s;s my mind. I however went to him, when, after &s;ome little intro|ductory conver&s;ation, he told me, that my ho&s;t Mr. &mdash; had been with him that morning, laying be|fore him a complaint of a mo&s;t extraordinary and &s;e|rious nature, of which, as it immediately concerned me, he thought him&s;elf bound to inform me, in order that I might either contradict &s;o gro&s;s a calumny if it were untrue, or find means to avoid the obviou&s;ly ne|ce&s;&s;ary re&s;ult if founded in fact.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to relate to me, that Mr. &mdash; had informed him of a con&s;piracy having been medi|tated
<PB N="229" REF="031911_0225_0FEF4B1CCE1DFBB0">
again&s;t his peace and honour, between his wife and the Engli&s;h gentleman whom he had entertained in his hou&s;e; that their plan was nothing le&s;s than an elopement, and that he did not know how &s;oon it might be carried into execution, if not timely pre|vented; and finally, that he had demanded the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the con&s;ul and his intere&s;t with the Turki&s;h magi&s;trate to prevent it, by granting him an armed force for the protection of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find that conver&s;ations &s;o very guarded as ours were di&s;covered, and more &s;o that the aggrieved per&s;on did not think proper to &s;peak to my&s;elf, and charge me in per&s;on with the of|fence; never reflecting the while, that all my ideas were military, and his merely commercial: I was al&s;o much at a lo&s;s to conjecture how he came to make the di&s;covery&mdash;but this I found afterwards he owed to a female &s;ervant, who had been improvidently in|tru&s;ted by her mi&s;tre&s;s with the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Finding, however, that by whatever means he be|came acquainted with the affair, it was a certain fact that he was appri&s;ed of it, I directly acknowledged the whole truth with the utmo&s;t candour to the con|&s;ul; told him the affair &s;tep by &s;tep as it aro&s;e, a&s;&s;u|ring him (which I really thought to be the ca&s;e) that pity for the lady's deplorable &s;ituation made me li&s;ten to &s;uch a mea&s;ure; and that unlawful pa&s;&s;ion had &s;o little to do with it, that in all our private conferences we had never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the limits of purity; and that her per&s;on was, at lea&s;t re&s;pecting me, and I firmly believed all mankind, &s;potle&s;s and inviolate. I added, that great allowances were to be made for a young creature barely eighteen years of age, con|&s;igned by the wickedne&s;s of avaricious parents to the embraces of a man of &s;ixty-five; who, amiable and worthy though he was, in &s;ocial intercour&s;e with the world (which I knew him to be), was yet in the mo&s;t
<PB N="230" REF="031911_0226_0FEF4B1E68BA4CD0">
indi&s;pen&s;able point of connubial felicity &s;o utterly de|fective, as nece&s;&s;arily to create di&s;gu&s;t and abhorrence in a youthful mind. I remarked to him, that, in the forming of laws, it as plainly appeared on their face, who made them among&s;t the Engli&s;h, as it does on the face of the Gentoo laws, that they were made by the Bramins: for, as by the latter the penalty of a few puns <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Couries, a kind of &s;mall &s;hells u&s;ed in India, as a circula|ting medium in place of coin, in value much below the &s;malle&s;t copper coin&mdash;a Pun is a certain number of them.</NOTE> of couries (not value a &s;hilling) is annexed to the perpetration of a crime, for which tho&s;e of another cla&s;s lo&s;e their lives; &s;o, among us, it ap|pears that our laws are made by the aged, the decre|pid, the &s;en&s;ual, and the rich. El&s;e it could never happen that there were in the &s;ame code, laws to pu|ni&s;h marriage between the young and vigorous, and enable the brutality of a parent to take its full &s;cope, and con&s;ign, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, youth, beauty, health, and every per&s;onal attraction, to the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s of age, infirmity, and impotence. And I concluded by &s;aying, that all parties aiding in &s;uch an unnatural confederacy &s;hould be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The con&s;ul fairly acknowledged there was too much truth in what I had &s;aid; but remarked withal, that it was rather a hazardous experiment, and he was &s;ure it would be an endle&s;s one, to correct all the abu&s;es to which the fallibility of man, and his incom|petency to form any thing perfect, nece&s;&s;arily left &s;o|ciety and their laws liable&mdash;that the law was written, and it was the duty of every individual to obey it&mdash; and that in ca&s;es of adultery, the offence could be ju&s;|tified on no &s;olid grounds whatever, for, independent of the feelings of the hu&s;band, which perhaps were more poignant in old age than youth, the injury to his family was not to be got over, in probably giving
<PB N="231" REF="031911_0227_0FEF4B2186716230">
to him an heir no way a-kin to him. "It would be right, I think," &s;aid he, "to &s;top &s;uch di&s;proportion|ate matches; yet, once made, they &s;hould be as reli|giou&s;ly ob&s;erved inviolate as tho&s;e of love, among which we almo&s;t as frequently, as in tho&s;e of compul|&s;ion, &s;ee in&s;tances of infidelity. If you doubt this," &s;aid he, "read the records of Doctors' Commons."</P>
<P>I agreed to the ju&s;tice of what he &s;aid, at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ured him, that my intentions went no farther than wi&s;hing the lady to be re&s;cued from her thral|dom, which I told him was dreadful.&mdash;" I am &s;ure," &s;aid the con&s;ul, "that Mr. Campbell thinks &s;o, be|cau&s;e I am convinced he would not otherwi&s;e &s;ay &s;o. But may not," &s;aid he, &s;miling, "may not Mr. C. have deceived him&s;elf? the&s;e are things in which the pa&s;&s;ions are &s;trangely apt to hoodwink the under&s;tand|ing. However," continued he, breaking off plea|&s;antly, "I mu&s;t give you all the comfort that truth will allow me to do: I am &s;ure that the poor lady is con|demned to great wretchedne&s;s; partly from my own ob&s;ervation, partly from public report, and partly from her own mouth: for you mu&s;t know &s;he has &s;e|veral times complained to me of her hu&s;band's peevi&s;h|ne&s;s and tyranny; and even be&s;ought me to u&s;e my influence and authority to relieve her from her mi&s;ery. Mr. &mdash;," continued he, "is a man whom on all other accounts I e&s;teem, and value highly. In this in|&s;tance he has erred, and I cannot pity him, even though he &s;uffers all the torments of jealou&s;y: and as there are laws for puni&s;hing with death premature in|tercour&s;e with the &s;ex, I cannot &s;ee, any more than you, why the &s;acrificing youth to extreme old age &s;hould not be equally puni&s;hed, for I am &s;ure it is equally unnatural, and &s;till more injurious to a &s;tate. The&s;e are my &s;entiments," continued he; "but let not this declaration induce you to think that I the le&s;s di&s;approve of your intermeddling. You have allowed

me the privilege of a friend, and I will not &s;uffer it to be made an empty one. You were more culpable than many young men would be; fir&s;t, becau&s;e you are married, and &s;hould, upon the common principle of doing as you would be done by, have refrained; and next, becau&s;e you were enjoying the &s;weets of ho&s;pitality in his hou&s;e, and &s;hould have da&s;hed from his lips, rather than held to them, the deepe&s;t cup of bitterne&s;s."</P>
<P>"But, my dear &s;ir," &s;aid I, "I do not attempt to ju&s;tify&mdash;I only endeavour to mitigate the matter, and you will recollect that the very circum&s;tance which in one point of view aggravates, in another alleviates the fault: the living in his hou&s;e afforded tho&s;e interviews and expo&s;ed me to tho&s;e temptations under which I was near &s;inking&mdash;I &s;hould never have &s;ought them: but he mu&s;t be more or le&s;s than man, that could have re&s;i&s;ted them; and though I have a high &s;en&s;e of Mr. Con&s;ul's &s;trict honour and virtue, as well as prudence, he mu&s;t excu&s;e me, though I doubt whether he could him&s;elf have re&s;i&s;ted &s;o long and &s;o effectually as I did. I am &s;ure there are many who will cen&s;ure, that could not."</P>
<P>The con&s;ul &s;miled, and, turning the di&s;cour&s;e from its direct line, ob&s;erved, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary I &s;hould de&s;i&s;t, el&s;e he would be obliged to u&s;e his influence and power to protect Mr. &mdash;.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, I gave him my honour in the fir&s;t place, that I would proceed no farther in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and that, on the contrary, I was determined to &s;et out upon my journey to India directly, if means could be contrived for my conveyance; adding, that I &s;hould con&s;ider it as a great favour, in addition to tho&s;e I had already received at his hands, if he would contrive &s;ome means to &s;et me forward in my route.</P>
<P>To this he an&s;wered, that as the making up of a caravan would be extravagantly expen&s;ive, he knew
<PB N="233" REF="031911_0229_0FEF4B28E3759748">
no means that were not attended with certain hard|&s;hip and eventual danger; but finding me determined at almo&s;t any danger or hazard to &s;et off, he pro|po&s;ed to &s;end for a man who knew every re&s;ource in that way, and when he came would talk farther on the bu&s;ine&s;s; and in the mean time, recommended great circum&s;pection to me while I continued at Mr.&mdash;'s hou&s;e, to which I very &s;olemnly pledged my word.</P>
<P>Being now con&s;trained by every con&s;ideration, as well of prudence and decency as of inclination, to leave Aleppo immediately; I determined that no common impediments &s;hould &s;top me, and waited with impatience the arrival of the per&s;on on whom the con&s;ul re&s;ted his hopes of di&s;patching me.</P>
<P>He came in the evening, and after a conference with the con&s;ul, he introduced him to me, and acquainted me that he was a Tartar, and one of the va&s;t number of that de&s;cription who are employed by the Turki&s;h &s;tate in carrying di&s;patches from court to the various viceroys and ba&s;haws, and interchangeably between them again; that they were men on who&s;e fidelity the utmo&s;t reliance could be had; and that this man, who had an excellent character, had agreed to take me to Bagdad, provided I would &s;ubmit to the di&s;gui&s;e of a Tartar.</P>
<P>The agreement between us I entirely &s;ubmitted to the di&s;cretion of the con&s;ul, who had the good|ne&s;s to &s;ettle it thus:&mdash;The Tartar was to deliver me &s;afe at Bagdad; to &s;upply me and my &s;ervant, who acted as interpreter, with an ample &s;ufficiency of pro|vi&s;ions and hor&s;es on the road; to exchange my hor&s;e for me as often as I plea&s;ed, and to go at &s;uch a rate, whether fa&s;ter or &s;lower, as I thought proper: for this he was to receive one hundred pounds; and I further promi&s;ed, as an encouragement to him, that if he acted to my &s;atisfaction, I would, on our arrival at Bagdad, add a douceur of twenty pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="031911_0230_0FEF4B2A75746708">The next day he came, and I had a di&s;tinct view of this my new fellow traveller and &s;uppo&s;ed ma&s;ter, for in &s;everal places I was to pa&s;s for his &s;lave.

He &s;urveyed me with great attention&mdash; opened his mouth two or three times like a ga&s;ping pike, as if to &s;peak&mdash;&s;troaked his whi&s;kers as often&mdash; and at la&s;t pronounced that he would undertake to conduct me; adding, in allu&s;ion to my black hair and dark complexion, that I looked more like a native, than any Frank he had ever &s;een. He ordered me to cut my hair quite &s;hort, to provide my&s;elf with the Tartar dre&s;s and cap, in the fa&s;hion of his own; and &s;aying he would call on me in proper time, departed.</P>
<P>Thus equipped, we &s;et out, not without great pain and regret on my part; pain at leaving a mo&s;t beautiful young woman, whom I pitied and e&s;teemed, &s;ubject

to the re&s;entment of a hu&s;band, at once jealous from nature, peevi&s;h from habit, and enraged from her open and unequivocal demon&s;trations of hatred and regret at having been betrayed by &s;ituation into &s;uch a very &s;erious dilemma.</P>
<P>After my departure from Aleppo, this affair was repre&s;ented in a variety of unfavourable lights to the different new comers from England; and as a &s;tory is that commmodity which of all others hone&s;t peo|ple do not love to &s;teal any thing from, in its pa&s;&s;age though their hands, it found its way in various forms (none of them however tending to &s;often it) to many of my friends and connections, tho&s;e from whom of all others I wi&s;hed to conceal it.

<P>I mu&s;t add, that previous to my departure the con&s;ul did every thing that it was po&s;&s;ible for him to do, conducive to my &s;afety and accommodation on the road, which as we were obliged to go to the city of Diarbeker, a great length out of our way, he ob&s;erved would be long, dreary, fatiguing, and hazardous; he procured me from others, and gave me him&s;elf, a num|ber of letters, and at parting de&s;ired me to comfort my&s;elf with the reflection, that when I arrived at my journey's end, I &s;hould have to boa&s;t, that I went to India by a route never travelled by an European before.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>AS I became familiari&s;ed to my Tartar guide I found his character di&s;clo&s;e much better traits than his fir&s;t appearance be&s;poke, and I began in&s;en&s;ibly to think him a very entertaining fellow: preceiving that I was very low &s;pirited and thoughtful, he exhibited manife&s;t marks of compa&s;&s;ion; and taking it into his head that I was actually removed for ever from my friends and my family, he &s;poke in a &s;tyle of regret and feeling, that did great honour to his heart: and to &s;ay the truth, he did every thing in his power to alleviate my feelings, conver&s;ing with me, either by means of the interpreter, or in broken lingua franca; &s;upplying all my wants cheerfully and abundantly; changing hor&s;es with me as often as I pea&s;ed, and going &s;low or galloping forward ju&s;t as be&s;t &s;uited my inclina|tion or humour.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object he &s;eemed to have in view on our journey, was to impre&s;s me with a notion of his con|&s;equence and authority, as a me&s;&s;enger belonging to the Sultan. As all tho&s;e men are employed by the fir&s;t magi&s;trates in the country, and are, as it were, the links of communication between them, they think them&s;elves of great importance in the &s;tate; while the great men who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s they are employed in, make them feel the weight of authority, and treat them with the greate&s;t contempt: hence they become habitually &s;ervile to their &s;uperiors, and by natural con&s;equence in&s;olent and overbearing to their inferiors, or tho&s;e who being in their power they conceive to be &s;o. As carriers of di&s;patches,
<PB N="237" REF="031911_0233_0FEF4B3405ABF338">
their power and authority wherever they go is in &s;ome points undi&s;puted; and they can compel a &s;upply of pro|vi&s;ions, hor&s;es, and attendants, wherever it &s;uits their occa&s;ions; nor dare any man re&s;i&s;t their right to take the hor&s;e from under him to proceed on the Empe|ror's bu&s;ine&s;s, be the owner's occa&s;ion ever &s;o pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>My feelings, which I can tell you were altoge|ther of the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant kind, &s;erved as a &s;ti|mulus to my mind, and increa&s;ed my anxiety to get forward; I therefore pu&s;hed on as fa&s;t as the hor&s;es, which were in general excellent, could carry me: and as we halted at a number of &s;tages to get fre&s;h hor&s;es and provi&s;ions, my Tartar guide had fre|quent opportunities of indulging his &s;elf-importance, and di&s;playing his great authority and power. As &s;oon as he &s;topped at a caravan&s;era, he immediately called lu&s;tily about him in the name of the Sultan, demanding with an imperious and menacing tone of voice, fre&s;h hor&s;es, victuals, &amp;c. on the in&s;tant. The terror of this great man operated like magic; nothing could exceed the activity of the men, the bri&s;kne&s;s of the women, and the terror of the children; for the caravan&s;eras are continually attended by numbers of the very lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of the people; but no quick|ne&s;s of preparation, no effort or indu&s;try could &s;atisfy my gentleman; he would &s;hew me his power in a &s;till more &s;triking point of view, and fall belaboring them with his whip, and kicking them with all his might. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was much hurt at this extravagant abu&s;e of up&s;tart power, and was two or three times on the point of interfering; but fortunately, recol|lected that it would neither be in character, nor have any good effect, and that if I pre&s;umed to &s;peak, my guide would be obliged in my defence to give me a flogging in order to prevent &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>This incon&s;iderate tyranny and cruelty, I had after|wards rea&s;on to believe, was by no means a part of his
<PB N="238" REF="031911_0234_0FEF4B373AA0B290">
natural di&s;po&s;ition; but vanity, to which &s;o many among us in Europe fall victims, urged him to exce&s;&s;es, which I dare &s;ay his heart privately condemned.</P>
<P>It was on the fifth or &s;ixth day (I cannot preci&s;ely &s;ay which) after our leaving Aleppo, that we got to the city of Diarbeker, the capital of the province of that name, having pa&s;&s;ed over an extent of country of between three and four hundred miles, mo&s;t of it ble&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t fertility, producing, in the few cultivated parts, grain, fruits of various kinds, and &s;ilk in great variety and abundance, and abound|ing with as rich pa&s;tures as I ever beheld, covered with numerous herds and flocks. The air was charm|ingly temperate in the day-time, but, to my feeling, extremely cold at night.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding the extreme fertility of this country, the bad admini&s;tration of government, con|&s;piring with the indolence of the inhabitants, leaves it unpopulous and uncultivated. Diarbeker, proper, called al&s;o Me&s;opotamia, from its lying between the two famous rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and by Mo|&s;es called PADAN ARAM, that is to &s;ay&mdash;"The fruit|ful Syria;" abounds with corn, wine, oil, fruits, and all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;eat of the Earthly Paradi&s;e, and all geographers agree that it was there the de&s;cendants of Noah fir&s;t &s;ettled after the flood.</P>
<P>In&s;ignificant as tho&s;e circum&s;tances may appear to mere calculators of profit and lo&s;s, it cannot be denied that they have a powerful and plea&s;ing effect on the refined imagination. To be treading that ground where Abraham trod; where Nahor the father of Rebecca lived; and where Laban, to whom Jacob fled to avoid his brother E&s;au's re&s;entment, and whom he &s;erved fourteen years for the love he bore to Ra|chel, was to me a circum&s;tance productive of delight|ful &s;en&s;ations. How finely has that giant of the pen,

Far from me, and from my friends, be &s;uch frigid philo&s;ophy, as may conduct us indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been dignified by wi&s;dom, bravery, or virtue!&mdash;that man is little to be envied who&s;e patrioti&s;m would not gain force upon the Plain of Marathon, or who&s;e piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona."</P>
<P>The city of Diarbeker it&s;elf is &s;ituated in a delight|ful plain on the banks of the river Tigris, and nearly at its head; it is one of the riche&s;t, mo&s;t trading, &s;trong, and populous cities in A&s;iatic Turkey; and is adorned with many piazzas and market places in the Turki&s;h &s;tyle, and a large magnificent mo&s;que, formerly a Chri&s;tian church; for Chri&s;tianity flou|ri&s;hed over this country &s;o late as the &s;ixth century. There is even now a &s;ect, who&s;e patriarch &s;till re&s;ides here: and they &s;hew on the road near the town, a chapel where the holy man Job is &s;aid to be buried. This city is &s;upplied amply with water by a canal cut from the Tigris, and has many caravan&s;eras on both &s;ides of the river.</P>
<P>Few countries in the world exceed that about this city for natural richne&s;s and beauty:&mdash;the bread and wine are excellent&mdash;the fruit beyond conception deli|cious

&mdash;and my friend the Tartar took care, under pretence of &s;upercilious <HI>hauteur,</HI> to tear in pieces a couple of fowls, and hand me now a leg, now a wing, till I made the mo&s;t delicious repa&s;t I ever remember to have eat in my life.</P>
<P>It is computed that there are re&s;ident in this city no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and Chri&s;tian inhabitants, &s;ome of whom are of the Church of Rome;&mdash;and perhaps it is owing to that mixture, that the fair &s;ex have more freedom, and the men more politene&s;s and affability, than tho&s;e of any other city in the em|pire:&mdash;the chief bu&s;ine&s;s there, is making that fine leather commonly called Turkey leather.</P>
<P>Figure to your&s;elf, my dear FREDERICK, my Tar|tar guide, who was an admirable actor, &s;itting at a caravan&s;era in &s;tate at his dinner, devouring excellent fowls, choice pillaws, and delicious fruit, in as great pomp as a ba&s;haw; and in order to keep up the &s;em|blance of authority over me, to favour my di&s;gui&s;e, handing to me, who &s;at at humble di&s;tance, a part of his provi&s;ions. You may form to your&s;elf an idea of the &s;cene; but all the efforts of imagination mu&s;t fall &s;hort of the manner, the figure, the words, the looks, and the actions of the Tartar; &s;ometimes affecting contemptuous pity, &s;ometimes &s;upercilious arrogance; &s;ometimes bru|tal &s;ternne&s;s, and &s;ometimes the gentle blandi&s;hments of con&s;cious &s;uperiority; and all in &s;uch a ma&s;terly &s;tile of performance, that I doubt whether Garrick him&s;elf, with all his powers of countenance, could outdo him. Critical though my &s;ituation was, and much as I was hara&s;&s;ed with the corro&s;ions of mental pain, the extra|vagant action and ludicrous pompo&s;ity of this man frequently overbore my prudence, and compelled me to laugh incontinently and loudly;&mdash;on all &s;uch occa|&s;ions he would put his hands a-kimbo, draw up his eye-brows to his turban, &s;crew down the corners of his mouth in the mo&s;t rueful manner, and give a loud

whew! with his eyes fixed in a &s;tare at me, till en|tirely overcome with laughter, and ready to &s;ink un|der it, I clapped my face between my hands, and, as well as I could, bowed in token of &s;orrow and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; when, threatening me vehemently, and at the &s;ame time uttering a lamentable expre&s;&s;ion of doubt that he was afraid he had had an idiot impo&s;ed on him, he would bu&s;tle about, direct the hor&s;es to be got ready, and order me to get on hor&s;eback, with many denunciations of &s;evere treatment, and a thou|&s;and flouri&s;hes of his whip over my head.</P>
<P>As I have rode along mu&s;ing upon the contemptible &s;tratagems to which I was reduced, in order to get through this country, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e I was a Chri&s;tian, I could not help reflecting with &s;or|row on the melancholy effects of &s;uper&s;tition, and re|gretting that that place, which in the times of primi|tive &s;implicity was called the Terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e; that place where GOD fir&s;t planted man after the flood; where the god-like Abraham and the holy Job breathed the pure air of piety and &s;implicity; that place which from all tho&s;e circum&s;tances ought to be con&s;idered above all others as the univer&s;al inheritance of mankind, &s;hould now be cut off from all but a horde of &s;en&s;ele&s;s bigots, barbarous fanatics, and in|flexible tyrants. And I could not help con&s;idering with melancholy concern, the blindne&s;s and infatua|tion of men, who, le&s;s earne&s;t to accommodate them|&s;elves than injure others, &s;hut out their fellow-crea|tures from that which they them&s;elves will not u&s;e, and, while they &s;uffer millions of the riche&s;t acres in the univer&s;e to be untilled, and &s;pend their &s;weetne&s;s in the de&s;ert air, with wicked jealou&s;y, and envy more than diabolical, begrudge to others the little &s;pot on which they &s;tand, and cha&s;e them as they would a ra|vening tiger from their country.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>AS we advanced towards the &s;outhward and ea&s;tward, in our way from Diarbeker towards Bagdad&punc; I found the air become &s;en&s;ibly warmer, and ob&s;erved that the di&s;po&s;ition of the people grew more and more brutal. My guide's conduct (for he knew them well) became proportionately artful, and my manners were of cour&s;e to grow &s;o much the humbler. I ob&s;erved, however, that his authority continued the &s;ame, and that he &s;eemed to exert it with greater rigour; not in &s;everity or cha&s;ti&s;ement, but in exacting implicit obedience. Yet &s;till he evidently acted with great caution and circum&s;pection; for, in &s;ome di&s;tricts, he either avoided the little villages by a circuitous route, or da&s;hed through them at a very quick pace, while the gaping multitude con&s;idered us as on a di&s;patch of ha&s;te and importance&mdash;in others, he entered the towns without re&s;erve, and left it to chance to decide whether we &s;hould be di&s;covered or not. At &s;ome caravan&s;eras he treated me with affected negligence, at others he made me eat with him and drink wine, of which, in &s;ome places, he him&s;elf drank copiou&s;ly, and at others as &s;crupulou&s;ly refrained from. And &s;ome|times we lay at night out in the open air, rather than enter a town; on which occa&s;ions I found the weather as piercing cold as it was di&s;tre&s;sfully hot in the day time. Bred, as the man was, a mixture of &s;lave and tyrant, I can &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome parts of this conduct to ari&s;e from caprice; but, as he was naturally kind, as
<PB N="243" REF="031911_0239_0FEF4B43F5FE3848">
many of tho&s;e aberrations from the u&s;ual mode of tra|velling were attended with hard&s;hip and inconvenience to him&s;elf, and as my &s;ervant and the other Tartar were clearly of opinion he was right, I am rather di&s;po&s;ed to believe that he, on the whole, acted from principles of &s;ound &s;en&s;e and policy.</P>
<P>He frequently advi&s;ed me again&s;t indulging in laugh|ter; &s;aid it was unmanly, indecorous, incon&s;i&s;tent with the gravity becoming a wi&s;e man, and withal danger|ous.</P>
<P>One evening we came to a caravan&s;era much fa|tigued, the day being extremely hot, and we having rode very hard&mdash;whether it was caprice or fatigue, or the &s;ugge&s;tion of policy that moved him, I cannot &s;ay, but he was certainly more di&s;po&s;ed to play the tyrant than I had ever before &s;een him. He flogged the men who took the hor&s;es, kicked every one he met, made the hou&s;e ring with his enormous voice; directed &s;upper to be got ready, ate growling, and find|ing fault with every thing; and under pretence of di&s;|liking the ingredients of an excellent pillaw, handed it over to me, &s;aying, Here, Jimmel (the name he called me), here, take this filth, and cram it down thy coar&s;e throat, it is only fit for a Frank&mdash;I took it with the be&s;t air of humility I could a&s;&s;ume; and tearing the meat with my fingers, which I al&s;o u&s;ed in&s;tead of a &s;poon to eat the rice, &s;wallowed it eagerly; he watching me all the time attentively. When I had fini&s;hed it, I gave him a hint in the Frank language, that I &s;hould like to wa&s;h it down with &s;ome wine; but he did not, or rather would not, un|der&s;tand me.</P>
<P>Supper done, he ordered a &s;ervant to attend him with &s;ome water, and directed him to wa&s;h his feet; while that operation was performing, he continued me|nacing every one about him. My &s;ervant, who &s;at next me and behind him, interpreted every thing he
<PB N="244" REF="031911_0240_0FEF4B491CC1D8D0">
&s;aid. "Yes, ye &s;laves," &s;aid he, as he lolled back upon his cu&s;hion, "yes, I will make the be&s;t of you wa&s;h my feet; for who &s;hall refu&s;e to wa&s;h the feet of him, who repre&s;ents the Sultan of the World, the Son of Mahomet, the Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord?" The poor fellow proceeded in his humble office, and only interrupted him by &s;aying, "Ble&s;&s;ed be my lord the &s;ultan, and glory be to the Lord our God, and Ma|homet his prophet."&mdash;"Yes, yes," continued my Tartar, "ble&s;s God and the prophet, and pray for his &s;ervant our &s;ultan, and all who repre&s;ent him like me, that &s;laves of your de&s;cription are permitted to live: nay, thou &s;halt wa&s;h this Frank's feet:" then, turning to me with an air of magi&s;terial tenderne&s;s, "Jimmel," &s;aid he, "hold forth thy feet, and let them be wa&s;hed by this di&s;ciple of Ali&mdash;I &s;ay, hold forth thy feet."</P>
<P>Scarcely able to refrain from laughter at this Bom|bardinian of the Ea&s;t, and his pompous manner of i&s;|&s;uing his orders, I drew up my trow&s;ers and took off my boots&mdash;the man brought fre&s;h water, and fell to rubbing my feet with great good will and humility; yet evidently felt &s;o much hurt at the humiliation, that I was &s;orry for it, and would rather have di&s;pen|&s;ed with the wa&s;hing, though it was a luxury.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this operation, the Tartar, who was reclining on his cu&s;hion, &s;moking, ro&s;e up, and &s;talk|ing two or three times acro&s;s the room, with the mo&s;t ludicrous air of &s;elf-conceit and importance, took his tobacco pipe from his mouth, brandi&s;hed it in o&s;ten|tatious parade, and in the tone and manner rather of one that was raving than of a man in his &s;ober &s;en&s;es, bur&s;t out with an emphatical expre&s;&s;ion of &s;atisfaction, and &s;aid, "This it is to be protected by a great man: Mu&s;&s;ulmen &s;alam to him and wa&s;h his feet."</P>
<P>The extravagance of this &s;entiment, the ab&s;urdity of its application, and the con&s;equential &s;olemnity of
<PB N="245" REF="031911_0241_0FEF4B4AC222FF40">
his action and countenance while he &s;poke, altogether ru&s;hed upon me with &s;uch impetuous force, that I could not re&s;i&s;t it, and, in &s;pite of every effort to re|&s;train my&s;elf, bur&s;t into an immoderate fit of laughter.</P>
<P>Had I the pencil of Hogarth, the pen of Shake|&s;peare, or the powers of a Garrick, I might attempt to give &s;ome idea of his countenance, when, turning, he beheld me convul&s;ed with laughter. I might at|tempt it, I &s;ay, but I could not do it ju&s;tice. Such a combination of ludicrous expre&s;&s;ion I never beheld; it was indeed an epitome of all the lower order of hu|man pa&s;&s;ions. Fury predominated, but it was ri&s;ible fury&mdash;it was fury that rather grinned than frowned; though under it were to be &s;een &s;hame and mortifica|tion, &s;orrow and re&s;entment, pride and degradation, &s;illy ba&s;hfulne&s;s and decayed importance. For &s;ome time he &s;tood transfixed to the &s;pot, his eyes gli&s;tening like tho&s;e of a rat in a trap; his pointed whi&s;kers moving with the contortions of his lips, and his mouth every now and then opening like the beak of a wounded hawk. To utter his &s;en&s;ations he was unable; and he continued in this &s;tate, not only till my laughter was abated, but till I had time to reflect, and be &s;eriou&s;ly concerned.</P>
<P>At length, without &s;aying a &s;entence, he wheeled about, threw off his &s;lippers, drew on his boots, voci|ferated till he brought all the people of the caravan|&s;era about him, and ordered hor&s;es to be ready in|&s;tantly. As orders from &s;uch a per&s;on were not likely to be di&s;obeyed, the hor&s;es were got ready. I &s;aw that I mu&s;t either proceed, or come to an open rup|ture with him; &s;o recollecting that I was my&s;elf in fault, that a di&s;pute might be fatal, and that at all events it was only the humour of the moment, I drew on my boots too, and was ready to go, though I was much fitter for a twelve hours' nap than for an hour's travelling on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="031911_0242_0FEF4B4DFB287090">We mounted immediately, and it was my good for|tune to have the be&s;t hor&s;e. He &s;et out upon the gallop, the moon &s;hining as bright almo&s;t as day; I put forward my hor&s;e, and kept rather before him, which vexed him &s;o, that he beat the poor animal he rode on mo&s;t unmercifully. At length, after about eight or ten miles riding, he called a halt&mdash;di&s;mount|ed, and &s;aid he would re&s;t there all night. I &s;aw it was all re&s;entment: but knowing that it would be in vain to remon&s;trate, I di&s;mounted too; and, judging that the be&s;t way to mortify him in return, was to comply with affected approbation, turned to my &s;er|vant and told him (knowing that it would go from him to the Tartar) that I was delighted with the beauty of the night; remarking at the &s;ame time, that lying in the &s;weet &s;alubrious air was far preferable to being confined in the &s;ultry filth of a caravan&s;era.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was communicated to the Tartar, he remarked, that the open air was the fitte&s;t place for the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t, and therefore &s;uitable to a Frank; but for his part, he would much rather repo&s;e on a cu&s;hion, which he &s;hould have done, had it not been for my accur&s;ed ri&s;ible faculties.</P>
<P>Here the conver&s;ation re&s;ted, and we fell a&s;leep. In a few hours he awoke us, and we &s;et forward: after &s;ome pau&s;e, he began in the following manner, which was interpreted to me, as he &s;poke, by my &s;ervant:</P>
<P>"Surely God made laughter for the deri&s;ion and &s;hame of mankind, and gave it to the Franks and the monkies; for the one ha, ha, ha's, and the other he, he, he's, and both are malicious, mi&s;chievous, and good for nothing but to fret and tantalize all that come acro&s;s them."</P>
<P>Here he pau&s;ed, as waiting for &s;omething to be &s;aid: however, I remained &s;ilent. At length, he continued: "Not but that, with all their laughter, they have the wi&s;dom to take &s;pecial care of them&s;elves&punc; for half a
<PB N="247" REF="031911_0243_0FEF4B4F8F2B6C40">
dozen monkies, will he, he, he, and empty a whole orchard of its fruit in the reckoning of a hundred; and a Frank will ha, ha, ha, and eat you up pillaws and poultry like a wolf, and drink up wine with the &s;ame moderation that a camel drinks up water."</P>
<P>I thought I &s;hould have choked with &s;mothered laughter: I would not however interrupt him, and &s;o contrived to keep it to my&s;elf: he proceeded to apo|thegmati&s;e:</P>
<P>"But with all their he, he, he's, and ha, ha, ha's, it &s;ometimes turns out that they are caught: the monkey is &s;eized in a trap and caged or knocked in the head, and the Frank is put in jail, and ba&s;tinadoed or hanged; and then the tune is changed, and it is Oh, ho, ho!" Here he began to mimic crying &s;o admirably, and at the &s;ame time &s;o ridiculou&s;ly; that I bur&s;t out laughing again.</P>
<P>"Ob&s;erve, Jimmel," &s;aid he ha&s;tily, "ob&s;erve! you can't refrain! But by our holy prophet," &s;aid he &s;eri|ou&s;ly, "it may end as I &s;aid: &s;o look to your&s;elf, and avoid laughter in caravan&s;eras, or we part; for there are places, and that was one of them la&s;t night, where &s;u&s;picion would ruin you. And if you lo&s;t your life, what &s;hould I &s;ay for my&s;elf on my return to Aleppo? Eh, what &s;hould I &s;ay for my&s;elf? Ha ha, ha! would not do. No, no, they would not believe it, and I &s;hould lo&s;e my character."</P>
<P>"Why, don't you laugh your&s;elf?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"Very &s;eldom, or rather never," returned he; "at lea&s;t I would not in time of danger. No, no, none but Chri&s;tians and monkies make a practice of laughing&mdash;Turks and Tartars are wi&s;er." I promi&s;ed him, that I would in future take more care and&punc; by way of appea&s;ing him with a little flattery, &s;aid&punc; that he played his part &s;o admirably, it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;e. But he an&s;wered, with a grave
<PB N="248" REF="031911_0244_0FEF4B5406A4F938">
face, that his action in that ca&s;e was of too &s;erious a nature to be made a &s;ubject of merriment&mdash;and ad|vi&s;ed me to believe it &s;o.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;olicitude of my guide for my &s;afety was the earne&s;tne&s;s of a man of bu&s;ine&s;s zealous to di&s;charge with the utmo&s;t punctuality the duty he had undertaken; and I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that the whole of his conduct evinced a preci&s;ion and punctuality of dealing rarely found in our intercour&s;e with mankind. Previous to leaving Aleppo, he had undertaken to convey me &s;afe&mdash;he was, as you may already perceive, indefatigable and unremitting in his endeavours to do &s;o; he had promi&s;ed to &s;upply me with food&mdash;&s;o he did, in the mo&s;t ample manner; he promi&s;ed to go as I plea&s;ed, fa&s;t or &s;low&mdash;&s;o he did; he promi&s;ed to change hor&s;es with me, as often as I thought proper to de&s;ire&mdash;he did &s;o. But beyond this, he &s;eemed to carry his care of me no farther than to any bale of goods he might have in his charge. He was bound to deliver me &s;afe, in good order and condition, at Bagdad: &s;o much he was determined to do, and no more did he think of. I had got letters to the ba&s;haws of &s;ome of the towns through which we were to pa&s;s: but as the delivery of a letter is, according to the cu&s;tom of that country al|ways accompanied with a pre&s;ent, I thought it bet|ter to decline delivering them, except when nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="249" REF="031911_0245_0FEF4B55954F71C0">
compelled&mdash;though the &s;tate of the country was &s;o un&s;ettled, that we often had occa&s;ion for a guard.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the remembrance of the laughing affair was a little decayed, the Tartar began to relax into good humour, and to talk with his u&s;ual vehemence; for he was always, according to the flow of his &s;pirits, either &s;ullenly &s;ilent or extravagantly loquacious. His tongue might be con&s;idered as a thermometer, by which the warmth or coldne&s;s of his temper might be calculated, and the extremes, of garrulity and taci|turnity were the indices. His conver&s;ation, however, was very circum&s;cribed, and con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of &s;tories of him&s;elf and his hor&s;e, the amazing journeys he made, and the feats of manhood he performed. One circum&s;tance I mu&s;t in ju&s;tice mention, as I think it marks &s;trongly the habitual delicacy and mode&s;ty of this people. Although he frequently lamented my bani&s;hment from my family, and although we were for eighteen days continually conver&s;ing on a variety of occa&s;ions that might lead to the &s;ubject, he never once talked of women; never, in all his pity for my &s;ituation, glanced even remotely at the po&s;&s;ibility of my getting a &s;ub&s;titute in that way; never hinted that he thought of them him&s;elf. On &s;eeing women, coming to the wells, they reminded me of &s;ome of the &s;tories in the Old Te&s;tament. I mentioned it, but it went no farther; for whenever the &s;ubject was &s;tarted, he threw cold water on it.</P>
<P>That he conceived me to be in &s;ome re&s;pects a parcel of property, I have good rea&s;on to believe: for I ob&s;erved that at &s;ome caravan&s;eras the people collec|ted round me, and regarded me with &s;trong &s;ymptoms of &s;urpri&s;e and pity; &s;ome viewed me with commi&s;era|tion, &s;ome with contempt; but not one creature, how|ever wretched or abject, &s;eemed to envy my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I was the more confirmed in this opinion by an incident that happened between Diarbeker and Mo&s;ul.
<PB N="250" REF="031911_0246_0FEF4B572A0FC6C8">
One morning I was unu&s;ually overcome with the fatigues of the preceding day: the Tartar called me, &s;ummoned me to hor&s;e; and finding that I gave no an&s;wer, nor &s;hewed any token of awaking, he lifted me in his arms bodily from my couch (&s;uch was his &s;trength that he did it without any difficulty), carried me out without the lea&s;t ceremony, and, before I was &s;o completely awake as to be &s;en&s;ible of my &s;ituation, had me fixed upon a hor&s;e ready to depart.</P>
<P>A tran&s;action &s;o very &s;ingular, you may well con|clude, &s;urpri&s;ed me at the time, and would not readily be forgotten: &s;uch a crowd of &s;trange, confu&s;ed, and incongruous thoughts and &s;en&s;ations as occurred to me, I never before experienced: they were painful, they were &s;urpri&s;ing&mdash;but I was in &s;uch a &s;tate that I could not af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">wards analy&s;e them. The chief reflec|tion that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore from it was, that human &s;entiment mu&s;t be in a deplorable &s;tate of degradation indeed, when &s;uch a circum&s;tance could occur from the notion that a man was as much an a&s;&s;et or piece of property, could be transferrred by the &s;ame means, and moved in the &s;ame unfeeling manner, as any portion of inert matter that makes up a bale of merchandize. Of the truth of this po&s;ition I had &s;oon after a melancholy proof, in an incident which, though lamentable, was attended with &s;uch ludicrous circum&s;tances, that even now I never think of it without &s;miling&mdash;&s;miling, as I did then, with a heart bleeding with pity.</P>
<P>One morning I was awakened before day-break with a bu&s;tle in the caravan&s;era where we lodged. I conjectured that the Tartar was preparing to get forward, and ro&s;e in order to lo&s;e no time. I was &s;o far right in my conjectures: the hor&s;es were ready, and I came out to mount, and was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to perceive &s;everal hor&s;es before me loaded with &s;omething which &s;tood erect from their backs, and which I had barely light to di&s;cern were not men. I
<PB N="251" REF="031911_0247_0FEF4AD0291EE2D0">
concluded that they were bales of merchandize packed in a particular form, and a&s;ked no que&s;tions till full day-light di&s;clo&s;ed to me that they were human crea|tures tied up in &s;acks, and fa&s;tened a&s;tride on the hor&s;es' backs. There was a &s;trange union of horror and oddity in the conception, that &s;truck me at once with a mixed emotion of indignation, pity, and mirth.&mdash; The former however got the better, and I a&s;ked my &s;ervant with &s;ome warmth what it meant.&mdash;He &s;aid that the &s;acks contained &s;ome young women whom the Tartar had bought.&mdash;"Good GOD!" &s;aid I, "is it po&s;&s;ible that he can have bought wretched females to treat them with &s;o little tenderne&s;s?" "He has bought them," returned my &s;ervant, "in the way of traffic, not for plea&s;ure."</P>

<P>To conclude, I took his advice, and kept my mind to my&s;elf.

<P>FROM the con&s;iderations I have already pretty fully mentioned, my mind was by no means at ea&s;e. The ince&s;&s;ant travelling for &s;o many days, at the rate of &s;eventy-five miles a day, to be continued I knew not how long, increa&s;ed my anxiety: and the apprehen&s;ions of accident, interruption, and above all &s;ickne&s;s, intercepting me on my way, haunted my imagination with all its terrors. I was be&s;ides ap|proaching fa&s;t to that region where the winds &s;trike all living things that draw them in in&s;tantly dead: and conceiving that the more expeditious I was in getting over the journey, the greater chance I had of e&s;caping tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs; I pu&s;hed heartily forward, and urged the Tartar till he at la&s;t expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment and approbation; paid me the compliment to &s;ay, that I was almo&s;t equal to him&s;elf for enduring fatigue; and concluded with a very &s;agacious &s;urmi&s;e, that in all probability I had been my&s;elf a carrier of di&s;patches among the Frank governments.</P>
<P>One day after we had rode about four miles from a caravan&s;era, at which we had changed our cattle, I found that a mo&s;t execrably bad hor&s;e had fallen to my lot: he was &s;tiff, feeble, and foundered; in con|&s;equence
<PB N="255" REF="031911_0251_0FEF4B625C41EAD0">
of which he &s;tumbled very much, and I every minute expected that he would fall and roll over me. I therefore propo&s;ed to the guide to ex|change with me; a favour he had hitherto never re|fu&s;ed, and for which I was the more anxious, as the bea&s;t he rode was of the very be&s;t kind. To my utter a&s;toni&s;hment he peremptorily refu&s;ed: and as this had been a day of unu&s;ual taciturnity on his part, I attri|buted his refu&s;al to peevi&s;hne&s;s and ill temper, and was re&s;olved not to let the matter re&s;t there. I there|fore de&s;ired the interpreter to inform him, that as he had at Aleppo agreed to change hor&s;es with me as often as I plea&s;ed, I &s;hould con&s;ider our agreement in|fringed upon if he did not comply, and would write to the Con&s;ul at Aleppo to that effect.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was conveyed to him, he &s;eemed &s;trongly agitated by anger; yet endeavoured to con|ceal his emotions under affected contempt and deri&s;ion, which produced from him one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular grins that ever yet marred the human phy&s;iognomy. At length he broke forth:</P>
<P>"You will write to Aleppo, will you? Fooli&s;h Frank! they will not believe you! By Mahomet, it would be well done to hear the complaint of a wan|dering Frank again&s;t Ha&s;&s;an Artaz&mdash;Ha&s;&s;an the faith|ful and the ju&s;t, who for ten years and more has been the me&s;&s;enger of an emperor, and the friend and con|fidant of cadis, ba&s;haws, and viceroys, and never yet was called &s;o much as liar! Who, think you, poor mi&s;guided one! who, think you, would believe that I broke my promi&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Why do you not then," &s;aid I, interrupting him, "why do you not perform it by changing hor&s;es, when you are convinced in your con&s;cience (if you have any) that it was part of your agreement?"&mdash; "Once for all I tell you," interrupted he, "I will
<PB N="256" REF="031911_0252_0FEF4B655F4B71B0">
not give up this hor&s;e. There is not," &s;aid he ga&s;co|nadingly, "there is not a Mu&s;&s;ulman that ever w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re a beard, not to talk of a wretched Frank, that &s;hould get this hor&s;e from under me; I would not yield him to the commander of the faithful this minute, were he in your place: I would not, I tell you, Frank&mdash; and I have my own rea&s;ons for it."</P>
<P>"I dare &s;ay you have," returned I; "love of your ea&s;e, and fear of your bones."</P>
<P>At hearing this, he grew quite outrageous&mdash;called MAHOMET and ALLA to witne&s;s that he did not know what it was to fear any thing&mdash;declared that he was convinced &s;ome infernal &s;pirit had that day got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me&mdash;and indeed &s;eemed well di&s;po&s;ed to go to logger-heads. At length ob&s;erving that I looked at him with &s;neering contemptuous defiance, he rode up along &s;ide of me&mdash;I thought it was to &s;trike, and prepared to defend my&s;elf. I was however mi&s;taken; he &s;natched the reins out of my hand, and caught hold of them collected clo&s;e at the hor&s;e's jaw; then fell flogging my hor&s;e and &s;purring his own, till he got them both into full &s;peed; nor did he &s;top there, but continued to belabour mine with his whip, and to &s;pur his own, driving headlong over every impedi|ment that came in our way, till I really thought he had run mad, or de&s;igned to kill me. Several times I was on the point of &s;triking him with my whip, in order to knock him off his hor&s;e&mdash;but as often patience providentially came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and whi&s;pered to me to forbear and &s;ee it out. Mean time I con&s;idered my&s;elf as being in &s;ome danger; and yet &s;uch was the power he had over the cattle, that I found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;top him: &s;o re&s;igning the event to the direction of Providence, I &s;uffered him without a further effort to proceed; I calling him every opprobrious name I could think of in lingua Franca, and he grinning, and
<PB N="257" REF="031911_0253_0FEF4B66F25BD880">
calling me Dumus, Jiha&s;h, Burhl (i. e. hog, a&s;s, mule), in rapid and impetuous vehemence of tone and utterance.</P>
<P>He continued this for a length of I dare &s;ay &s;ome miles, over an uncultivated tract, here and there in|ter&s;ected with channels formed by rills of water in the periodical rains; thickly &s;et with low furze, ferns, and other dwarf bu&s;hes, and broken up and down into little hills. His hor&s;e carried him clean over all: and though mine was every minute &s;tumbling and nearly down, yet with a dexterity inexpre&s;&s;ible, and a vigour altogether amazing, he kept him up by the bridle, and I may &s;ay <HI>carried</HI> him gallantly over every thing. I was a&s;toni&s;hed very much at all this, and towards the end as much plea&s;ed as a&s;toni&s;hed; which he per|ceiving, cried out frequently and triumphantly, "O, la Frangi! Heli! Heli! Frangi!" and at la&s;t drawing in the hor&s;es, &s;topping &s;hort, and looking me full in the face, exclaimed in lingua Franca, "Que dice, Frangi&mdash;Que dice?"</P>
<P>For &s;ome time I was incapable of making him any an&s;wer, but continued &s;urveying him from head to foot as the mo&s;t extraordinary &s;avage I had ever be|held; while he &s;troked his whi&s;kers with great &s;elf-complacency and compo&s;ure, and nodded his head every now and then, as much as to &s;ay, Ay, ay, it is &s;o! look at me! am not I a very capital fellow?&mdash; "A capital fellow indeed you are," &s;aid I, "but I wi&s;h I was well out of your confounded clutches."</P>
<P>We alighted on the brow of a &s;mall hill, whence was to be &s;een a full and uninterrupted pro&s;pect of the country all round. The interpreter coming up, he called to him and de&s;ired him to explain to me carefully the meaning of what he was about to &s;ay; which I will give you as nearly as I can in his own words, as they were tran&s;lated by the lingui&s;t:</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="031911_0254_0FEF4B6B5ED73BB0">"You &s;ee tho&s;e mountains yonder," &s;aid he, point|ing to the ea&s;t; "tho&s;e are in the province of <HI>Kur|de&s;tan,</HI> inhabited by a vile race of robbers called Je|&s;ides, who pay homage to a God of their own called Je&s;id (Je&s;us), and wor&s;hip the Devil from fear. They live by plunder, and often de&s;cend from tho&s;e moun|tains, cro&s;s the Tigris which runs between them and us, and plunder and ravage this country in bands of great number and formidable &s;trength, carrying away into &s;lavery all they can catch, and killing all who re&s;i&s;t them. This country therefore, for &s;ome di&s;tance round us, is very dangerous to travellers, who&s;e only &s;afety lies in flight. Now it was our misfortune this morning to get a very bad hor&s;e, for which, plea&s;e ALLA (&s;troking his whi&s;kers), &s;ome one &s;hall receive the ba&s;tinado. Should we meet with a band of tho&s;e Curds, what could we do but fly? And if you, Frangi, rode this hor&s;e, and I that, we could never e&s;cape: for I doubt you could not keep him up from falling under me, as I did under you: I &s;hould there|fore come down and be taken&mdash;you would lo&s;e your guide, and mi&s;s your way, and all of us be undone. Be&s;ides," continued he, "there are many villages here where people live, who, if they only &s;u&s;pected you were a Frank, would follow and &s;acrifice you if they could to MAHOMET, and where of cour&s;e you mu&s;t run for it."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the interpreter had explained this to me, "Well," continued the Tartar, "what does he &s;ay now to it?" Then turning to me, and to&s;&s;ing up his head&mdash;"Que dice, Frangi?"</P>
<P>"Why, I &s;ay," returned I, "that you have &s;po|ken good &s;en&s;e and &s;ound rea&s;on; and I am obliged to you."</P>
<P>This, when interpreted fully, operated mo&s;t plea|&s;ingly upon him; his features relaxed into a broad look of &s;atisfaction, and he &s;aid:&mdash;"I will do every
<PB N="259" REF="031911_0255_0FEF4B6FF0F7B0B8">
thing I can to make you ea&s;y and contented: and When I am ob&s;tinate, don't re&s;i&s;t&mdash;for be a&s;&s;ured I have rea&s;on for it; and above all things avoid laugh|ing in my pre&s;ence. But we &s;hall reach Mo&s;ul by and bye, and probably then we may have no more rides." For I expected to get down the river Tigris from Mo&s;ul to Bagdad, and had told him &s;o, and he encouraged me with the expectation.</P>
<P>That night we came to a caravan&s;era which lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from a village. Here the Tartar, plea&s;ed with him&s;elf for the conduct of the day, and plea&s;ed with me for my approbation of it, ordered a mo&s;t admirable &s;upper; and not only, as was very common with him, rejected the be&s;t di&s;h in order to pre&s;ent it to me, but al&s;o &s;elected for me the choice&s;t bits of tho&s;e upon the table. He then ordered wine, ob&s;erving that the fatigue of a government me&s;&s;enger demanded indulgence; and u&s;ing a &s;alvo of my &s;ug|ge&s;tion on a former occa&s;ion, viz. that the Prophet would not be offended with travellers more than with the &s;ick for taking it as it were <HI>medicinally.</HI></P>
<P>We accordingly had wine, and admirable it was, though by no means equal to that we drank at the city of Diarbeker. I took little however, and the Tartar was much &s;urpri&s;ed at my ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s; re|marking, that he never &s;aw a Frank before that was not a downright hog when he got the cup to his lips. My taking it in &s;mall portions, while he drank it as we do table beer, particularly a&s;toni&s;hed him. Before he lay down on his couch, he gave orders for hor&s;es, threatening the people with &s;evere ca&s;tigation if they gave bad ones; holding up as an example the per&s;on that gave us the &s;tumbling hor&s;e that day, who he de|clared &s;hould be ba&s;tinadoed as &s;oon as he returned, if there was a cadi within ten leagues of him; and I dare to &s;ay that he kept his word mo&s;t religiou&s;ly.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="031911_0256_0FEF4B72D8425F78">The next morning we had excellent cattle; fear produced wonders among them, and we &s;et forward ju&s;t as the &s;un ro&s;e.

<P>THE extraordinary occurrence which I men|tioned in my la&s;t letter required explanation, and my Tartar friend was not backward in giving it; for he loved exceedingly to hear him&s;elf talk, and, on any &s;ubject within the compa&s;s of his knowledge, was &s;hrewd, per&s;picuous, and even naturally eloquent: he had moreover on that occa&s;ion acted the part of a &s;kilful general; and as I applauded his prudence and addre&s;s, he was extremely kind and communicative, and gave me a full account of that affair, his motives, his deliberations, and the urgency of the ca&s;e; and, in &s;hort, every thing that could elucidate the circum|&s;tance, or aggrandize his own importance. It would be a pity to take it out of his own words: I &s;hall therefore relate them to you, as I had them through the medium of our lingui&s;t, for they made an impre&s;|&s;ion on my memory not ea&s;ily to be era&s;ed.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know," &s;aid he, "that there are &s;pread over the face of this great and glorious empire a number of dervi&s;es of different kinds&mdash;<HI>holy</HI> men, who renounce the enjoyments and plea&s;ures of the world, to conver&s;e with Mahomet and wor&s;hip Alla.

Nay, they often pollute women in the open &s;treets&mdash;and they never &s;et their eyes on a Chri&s;tian or a Frank, that they will not kill, if po&s;&s;ible.

Super&s;tition and credulity very natu|rally led to a con&s;ideration of the Turki&s;h religion, and I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;atisfaction, that the wor&s;t excre|&s;cences of the Chri&s;tian &s;chi&s;ms could not be compared with the Turki&s;h faith in their dervi&s;es. He &s;aid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he agreed it did not go quite the length of the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but he related to me a conver&s;ation between him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Roman catholic, not more than twenty-four miles from the enlightened city of Dublin, which &s;urpri&s;ed me much.</P>
<P>"I was," &s;aid he, "when a youth, very free in cen&s;uring all religions, and chiefly Popery; for, being bred among Roman catholics, I had the greater op|portunity of &s;eeing their ab&s;urdities, which I trea&s;ured up as &s;o much gain, without ever taking into ac|count their many virtues, of which they have their &s;hare. One day I was on a party of plea&s;ure, at a place called &mdash;, and in pre&s;ence of a poor country fellow ridiculed the prie&s;thood, attributing to them many vices, and particularly fornication and

Then I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid I, if a prie&s;t and a woman were locked up in a room together for a year, and the woman in a week after coming forth was brought to bed of a child, you would not believe it to be the prie&s;t's.

<P>The difficulties and hazards of the journey, which &s;eemed to thicken upon us as we advanced, made me p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt for a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion to it; and the adven|ture of the la&s;t day opened more clearly to my view the dangers we had to encounter, which were &s;till likely to increa&s;e as we got to the ea&s;tward and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">thward, where the fury of bigotry raged with|out remor&s;e; where the greater di&s;tance from the

I therefore earne&s;tly longed to reach Mo&s;ul, where the probability was, I &s;hould get at lea&s;t the more com|fortable and commodious conveyance of water carriage, and where I might refre&s;h my&s;elf completely, after the fatigues of &s;o many days journey; and, if there

<P>I could not help viewing with a &s;ad and melan|choly eye my pre&s;ent &s;tate; wandering, I may &s;ay alone, unaccommodated and wretched, through an inho&s;pitable region, and more inho&s;pitable people; where danger be&s;et me in a thou&s;and forms, and every &s;tep I took, I took in hazard of my life; and comparing it with tho&s;e &s;cenes of opulence and comfort which I had once experienced, where every lawful wi&s;h met with its accompli&s;hment; where every nece&s;&s;ity was &s;upplied, and every difficulty obviated; where tender love and attachment antici|pated every de&s;ire; and &s;oothed every care: where the mutual endearments and recipr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al accommoda|tions of tender relatives, wife, children, faithful friends, and kindly intimates gave a ze&s;t to life, made me feel that my exi&s;tence was of intere&s;t to others as well as to my&s;elf, and communicated a con&s;cious impor|tance which the i&s;olated, &s;olitary, &s;elfi&s;h man can never feel: I could not help looking back with grief and mortification, to think that I once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;hould perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;s them no more; but, on the contrary, might peri&s;h unknown, un|heeded, and unlamented, in an unknown corner of the wilds of an unknown ho&s;tile country, without one friend to &s;olace or to cheer me, or tell to tho&s;e who loved or took &s;hare in my concerns, the place where I lay, or the particulars of my fate.</P>
<P>Nor in this di&s;mal train of reflections was Aleppo forgotten. It made the great connecting link be|tween my former happine&s;s and pre&s;ent mi&s;ery; it was, as it were, the door through which I pa&s;&s;ed when I took my la&s;t farewell of comfort: when it clo&s;ed and &s;hut me out, the pro&s;pect was indeed gloomy; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> did I after feel one happy &s;en&s;ation, unle&s;s the

convul&s;ive tran&s;ports of a laugh, and the boi&s;terous fleeting mirth ari&s;ing from the &s;ingularities of my guide, which, as the &s;urge rai&s;ed by the tempe&s;t above its proper height lifts up the &s;hattered bark only to ca&s;t it on the beach and leave it &s;hipwrecked, elevated my &s;pirits for the moment beyond their proper pitch, to retire quickly, and leave them in the horrors of ten times deeper melancholy.</P>
<P>Perceiving how much ca&s;t down I was, my friendly Tartar began to rally me: "Jimmel," &s;aid he, "the &s;antons have frightened you:&mdash;but don't be afraid &mdash;HASSAN ARTAZ is no boy: he can bring you through greater difficulties than tho&s;e, &s;hould they be|fall us."</P>
<P>"But how comes it," &s;aid I, "Ha&s;&s;an, that you, who have &s;o much power at the caravan&s;eras, have not power to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e ra&s;cally &s;antons, or the mobs of a village?"</P>
<P>"Why, as to the mob," &s;aid he, "if I was by my&s;elf, or had only a true Believer with me, I would make them fly before me like the du&s;t before the wind.

<HEAD>LETTER XLII.</HEAD>
<P>IT was early in the evening when the pointed turrets of the city of Mo&s;ul opened on our view, and communicated no very unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations to my heart. I found my&s;elf on Scripture ground; and could not help feeling &s;ome portion of the pride of the traveller, when I reflected that I was now within &s;ight of Nineveh, renowned in Holy Writ.&mdash;The city is &s;eated in a very barren &s;andy plain, on the banks of the river Tigris, embelli&s;hed with the united gifts of Pomona, Ceres, and Flora. The external view of the town is much in its favour, being encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;tately walls of &s;olid &s;tone, over which the &s;teeples or minarets of other lofty build|ings are &s;een with increa&s;ed effect. Here I fir&s;t &s;aw a large caravan encamped, halting on its march from the Gulph of Per&s;ia to Armenia; and it certainly made a mo&s;t noble appearance, filling the eye with a multitude of grand objects, all uniting to form one magnificent whole.</P>
<P>But though the out&s;ide be &s;o beautiful, the in&s;ide is mo&s;t dete&s;table: the heat is &s;o inten&s;e, that in the middle of the day there is no &s;tirring out; and even at night the walls of the hou&s;es are &s;o heated by the day's &s;un, as to produce a di&s;agreeable heat to the body at a foot or even a yard di&s;tance from them. However, I entered it with &s;pirits, becau&s;e I con&s;idered it as the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t &s;tage of the wor&s;t part
<PB N="268" REF="031911_0264_0FEF4B7B7968AF90">
of my pilgrimage. But, alas! I was di&s;appointed in my expectation; for the Tigris was dried up by the inten&s;ity of the heat, and an unu&s;ually long drought; and I was obliged to take the matter with a patient &s;hrug, and accommodate my mind to a journey on hor&s;eback, which, though not &s;o long as that I had already made, was likely to be equally dangerous, and which therefore demanded a full exertion of fortitude and re&s;olution.&mdash;There are a thou&s;and latent energies in every man, which only want the power|ful voice of nece&s;&s;ity to call them out: and now drawn to the top of my bent, I prepared my mind to &s;et out in the morning, with as much cheerful|ne&s;s as if the hopes of water carriage to Bag|dad had never once occurred to my mind.</P>
<P>It was &s;till the hot &s;ea&s;on of the year, and we were to travel through that country, over which the horrid wind I have before mentioned &s;weeps its con&s;uming bla&s;ts: it is called by the Turks &s;amiel, is mentioned by holy Job under the name of the Ea&s;t Wind, and extends its ravages all the way from the extreme end of the Gulph of Cambaya up to Mo&s;ul; it carries along with it fleaks of fire, like threads of &s;ilk; in&s;tantly &s;trikes dead tho&s;e that brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e it, and con&s;umes them inwardly to a&s;hes; the fle&s;h &s;oon becoming black as a coal, and dropping off from the bones. Philo&s;ophers con&s;ider it as a kind of electric fire, proceeding from the &s;ulphureous or nitrous exha|lations which are kindled by the agitation of the winds. The only po&s;&s;ible means of e&s;cape from its fatal effects, is to fall flat on the ground, and there|by prevent the drawing it in: to do this, however, it is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to &s;ee it, which is not always practicable.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, the ordinary heat of the climate is extremely dangerous to the blood and lungs, and even to the &s;kin, which it bli&s;ters and peels away
<PB N="269" REF="031911_0265_0FEF4B80BB029140">
from the fle&s;h, affecting the eyes &s;o much, that tra|vellers are obliged to wear a tran&s;parent covering over them to keep the heat off.</P>
<P>That night, Ha&s;&s;an &s;aid, that as we mu&s;t proceed to Bagdad on hor&s;eback, he would &s;tay the next at Mo&s;ul to refre&s;h us; which I objected to: he then &s;poke of the &s;ucceeding part of the journey as a thing of nothing: we had already come near nine hundred miles, and had not above five to go: be&s;ides, as the weather was warmer, we would travel more in the night, and lie-by in the day|time, in places with which he was well acquainted.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the poor fellow &s;eemed to take an in|tere&s;t in my &s;afety, and to wi&s;h to alleviate the pains of my mind; and he always concluded with a remon&s;trance, again&s;t laughing, which from fre|quently hearing I now under&s;tood even in his own language.&mdash;"Don't laugh, Jimmel, don't laugh," he would &s;ay with great &s;olemnity.&mdash;By the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ye, I ob&s;erved, that when he was well di&s;po&s;ed to me he always called me Jimmel (a name which I pre&s;ume he con&s;tructed, with my &s;ervant's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from the re&s;emblance of &s;ound between Campbel and Camel, Jimmel being the Turki&s;h for that animal); and when angry, he called me Frangi, with all its gradations of Turki&s;h abu&s;e, Dumus, Cucu, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That evening, as we &s;at in the caravan&s;era, a man entered and &s;poke to Ha&s;&s;an, who &s;eemed to pay great attention to what he was &s;aying.&mdash;He was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> well made man&mdash;below the middle &s;ize&mdash;and had that kind of countenance which be&s;peaks &s;hrewdne&s;s, ingenuity, and mirth. At length he retired; and &s;oon after Ha&s;&s;an bade us ri&s;e and follow him: he went into a &s;ort of public room, where a number of people were collected, &s;itting as is the cu&s;tom&punc; in coffee|hou&s;es on low &s;tools. Ha&s;&s;an pointed to me to &s;it down, which I did: then placing the Interpreter
<PB N="270" REF="031911_0266_0FEF4B825169C380">
near us, he &s;at him&s;elf: and &s;traight I perceived the little man, who had ju&s;t been &s;peaking to him, &s;tep forth from the crowd and begin to pronounce a &s;ort of prologue, which I neither under&s;tood nor wi&s;hed to under&s;tand: it appeared from his cadences to be metrical, and &s;eemed, by the little impre&s;&s;ion it made on his auditors, to have nothing particular to recommend it. At length, however, he pau&s;ed, and, hemming &s;everal times to clear his pipes, began again to hold forth. "He is going to tell a &s;tory," &s;aid the Interpreter. The attention of all was fixed upon him, and he proceeded with a modulation of tones, a variety of action, and an energy of expre&s;&s;ion, that I think I have never heard or &s;een excelled: his action indeed was &s;ingularly admirable; and I could preceive that he was occa&s;ionally &s;peaking in the tones of a man and a woman; in which latter character he gave a picture of whining ludicrous di&s;|tre&s;s, that moved the ri&s;ible mu&s;cles of all the company. I looked at Ha&s;&s;an, and he was grinning as merrily as could any monkey or Frank in A&s;ia. The Lin|gui&s;t occa&s;ionally interpreted what the &s;tory-teller was &s;aying; and I &s;oon began to &s;u&s;pect that it was a &s;tory I had more than once read in the Arabian Nights, though altered, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure drama|tized by the &s;peaker. I looked &s;everal times archly at Ha&s;&s;an, and he returned my glance, as much as to &s;ay, You &s;ee I don't laugh at all this. At length, however, the orator came to a part where he was to mimic a poor little hunch-back (for I now di&s;|covered it to be the &s;tory of little Hunch-back) choking with a bone: he threw up his back; &s;queezed till all the blood in his body &s;eemed col|lected in his face, his eyes rolled in their &s;ockets, his knees knocked, he twi&s;ted and folded his body, putting his fore-finger, and thumb into his throat, and pulling with all his might, as if to pull &s;ome|thing
<PB N="271" REF="031911_0267_0FEF4B854850E800">
out: at length he grew weaker, &s;tretched his arms down, and his fingers back, like tho&s;e of a per&s;on &s;trangling&mdash;kicked, fell, quivered, and died. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any de&s;cription to do ju&s;tice to the perfection of his acting; and what rendered it the more extraordinary was, that though it was a &s;cene of death, and well acted death, he continued to render it &s;o ludicrous in circum&s;tances, as to &s;u&s;|pend the audience between a laugh and cry. They did not remain long &s;o; for he &s;uddenly bounced up, and began the mo&s;t doleful lamentation of a woman, and exhibited &s;uch a &s;cene of burle&s;que di&s;tre&s;s as I never witne&s;&s;ed. All bur&s;t out in tor|rents of laughter, Ha&s;&s;an as well as the re&s;t&mdash;I alone remained purpo&s;ely &s;erious; and the orator, according to cu&s;tom, broke off in the middle of an intere&s;ting &s;cene.</P>
<P>When we returned to the caravan&s;era, I rallied the Tartar on the &s;core of his laughter: he growled, and &s;aid, "Who could avoid it? Why did not you laugh as you were wont?"&mdash;"Becau&s;e," &s;aid I, "he did not act as comically as you."&mdash;"No," returned he, "but becau&s;e Franks and monkies only laugh for mi&s;chief, and where they ought not. No, Jimmel, you will never &s;ee me laugh at mi&s;chief." &mdash;"What," &s;aid I, "not at a poor man's being choked to death!"&mdash;"Nay," &s;aid he, "I &s;eldom laugh, yet I could not avoid it the." That very hour, however, a puppet-&s;how was exhibited in the &s;ame room, and my grave guide laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and his voice &s;unk into a whin|ing treble. <HI>Kara ghu&s;e</HI> was certainly extravagantly comical, though filthy; and frightened a cadi with a whole troop of Jani&s;&s;aries, by letting fly at them a &s;hot or two&mdash;<HI>a parte po&s;t</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>The next day we &s;et out well mounted, and pu&s;hed on with renovated &s;pirits towards Bagdad. Ha&s;&s;an
<PB N="272" REF="031911_0268_0FEF4B870AB26358">
could no more have the a&s;&s;urance to cen&s;ure laughing and, as I was little di&s;po&s;ed to do it in time of danger, we were likely to agree well. In &s;hort, we began to like one another's company; and if I brought him to be a greater laugher than he u&s;ed to be, he gave him&s;elf the credit of having made me much more &s;erious than I had been before&mdash;I profited by his in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>It would be an effort as idle and fruitle&s;s on my part, as unentertaining and unintere&s;ting on yours, to attempt to give you a regular detail of our progre&s;s from Mo&s;ul to Bagdad; the &s;ame general cautions were ob&s;erved, with the &s;ame occa&s;ional relaxations. Ha&s;&s;an &s;till continued to treat me with a repetition of him&s;elf and his hor&s;e, his own feats and his hor&s;e's feats; to be &s;ilent when ill-tempered, and loqua|cious when gay; to flog the attendants at the cara|van&s;eras; order the be&s;t hor&s;es, and eat the be&s;t vic|tuals, and to give me the be&s;t of both; and finally we had our fallings out and fallings in again: but I had not the mortification of &s;eeing any more women tied in &s;acks on hor&s;es' backs, and excoriated with a ride of fifty miles a day.</P>
<P>As we rode along we overtook &s;everal times &s;trag|gling callenders, a kind of Mahomedan monks, who profe&s;s poverty and great &s;anctity; they were dre&s;&s;ed all in rags, covered with filth, carried a gourd, by way of bottle, for water&mdash;I pre&s;ume &s;ometimes for wine too&mdash;and bore in their hands a long pole deco|rated with rags, and pieces of cloth of various colours. They are &s;uppo&s;ed by the vulgar to have &s;uper|natural powers: but Ha&s;&s;an, who &s;eemed to have caught all his ideas from his betters, expre&s;&s;ed no &s;ort of opinion of them; he <HI>&s;alam'd</HI> to them and gave them money, however. It was extraordinary enough, that they were all in one &s;tory&mdash;all were going on a pilgrimage to Mecca&mdash;or, as they call it, <HI>Hadje.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="031911_0269_0FEF4B8BB06B2C10">As &s;oon as ever we got out of their &s;ight and hearing, Ha&s;&s;an &s;hook his head, and repeated "Hadje, Hadje!" &s;everal times doubtingly, and grinned, as he was accu&s;tomed to do when he was di&s;plea&s;ed, without being able to manife&s;t anger. "Hadje!" he would cry, "Hadje, Hadje!" I a&s;ked him what he meant; and he &s;aid, that the&s;e fellows were no more going to Mecca than I was.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FREDERICK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER pa&s;&s;ing through an immen&s;e tract of country, di&s;tingui&s;hed by nothing that could &s;erve even as a circum&s;tance to mark and remember our daily journeys, but which I ob&s;erved to grow mani|fe&s;tly wor&s;e, both in &s;oil and climate, as we pro|ceeded Southward, we came in &s;ight of the famous city of Bagdad, on the &s;eventh day from that on which we left Mo&s;ul, and on the eighteenth from that of my departure from Aleppo; in which eighteen days we had rode fourteen hundred miles, partly through a route which no European, I have rea&s;on to believe, ever took before.</P>
<P>On entering the city, I de&s;ired my guide to con|duct me to the hou&s;e of a Merchant, to whom I had got letters of credit and introduction. He took me accordingly through the windings of &s;everal &s;treets, and at la&s;t &s;topped at the door of an Armenian Mer|chant, or <HI>Coja,</HI> where he made me alight, and come in. I was received with great politene&s;s; and, on
<PB N="276" REF="031911_0271_0FEF4B90764A2D98">
producing my letter, found that he was not the per|&s;on to whom it was directed: I accordingly made a &s;uitable apology, and was for retiring to find the hou&s;e of the proper per&s;on, for which purpo&s;e the Armenian offered me a &s;ervant, when, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment, my Tartar interfered; &s;aid that it was to this Merchant he brought all his goods, and that I mu&s;t remain where I was; at the &s;ame time order|ing the Armenian, in a peremptory tone, to take charge of me, and u&s;e me well. It was in vain that the Armenian endeavoured to explain to him the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and that I in&s;i&s;ted I mu&s;t go to the other Merchant&mdash;HASSAN was peremtory, and declared that I &s;hould not. It was &s;o extremely <HI>outre</HI> and ridiculous, that I could not be angry; and the good Armenian uniting his voice with that of the Tartar, and entreating me to favour him with my company, I acquie&s;ced, and indeed remained in his hou&s;e all the time I was at Bagdad. This was proof po&s;itive, if any other than I already had was wanting, that he con&s;idered me merely as a piece of merchandi&s;e, which he was bound (according to the language of Merchants) to deliver in good order and condition.</P>
<P>I had undertaken, before leaving Aleppo, to give the guide, if he acted conformably to my wi&s;hes, and behaved well, twenty pounds over and above the hundred provided by the agreement: I therefore &s;ent for him, to &s;ettle finally, and part. He had heard that I was a per&s;on different from what he had &s;uppo&s;ed me to be: but it did not alter his conduct, as might be expected, or make him &s;toop to cring|ing; he &s;till &s;poke with the &s;ame hone&s;t, bold fami|liarity; and when I gave him the promi&s;ed twenty pounds, he never hinted, cringed for, or even looked as if he expected more: but when we came to part, the feelings he di&s;clo&s;ed, and tho&s;e I my&s;elf felt,

convinced me, that Man is not naturally that brute which prejudice has made him; and, when left to its own operations, the human heart would be uni|formly kindly, affectionate, and &s;ympathetic: the poor, rough, unpoli&s;hed Turk, betrayed the &s;tronge&s;t marks of &s;en&s;ibility, and I my&s;elf once more felt the unea&s;ine&s;s of parting.</P>
<P>I think this is the proper place to give you my opinion of the Turks, while the recollection of hone&s;t HASSAN is fre&s;h in my mind; and I cannot do it better than by quoting the words of an excel|lent French Writer&mdash;</P>
<P>"The Turks (&s;ays M. du LOIR) are naturally a good people, which is not to be a&s;cribed to the cli|mate; for the Greeks born in the &s;ame climate have very different di&s;po&s;itions, and retain only the bad qualities of their ance&s;tors, viz. roguery, treachery, and vanity. The Turks, on the contrary, priding them&s;elves on their integrity and mode&s;ty, are di&s;|tingui&s;hed in general by an open, ingenuous &s;impli|city of manners; courtiers only excepted, who, in Turkey, as every where el&s;e, are the &s;laves of am|bition and avarice."</P>
<P>The name of Bagdad has been &s;o renowned in Ea&s;tern &s;tory, and is the &s;cene of &s;o many of tho&s;e bewitching tales which we find tran&s;lated, or pre|tended to be tran&s;lated, from the Arabic and Per|&s;ian, that I felt great plea&s;ure in &s;eeing it, and con|ceived my&s;elf to be at the very fountain-head of marvellous adventure and romance. Fraught with this idea, I was impatient to go forth into the town; and notwith&s;tanding the weather was beyond con|ception hot, I paraded a number of &s;treets: but never did I, in the cour&s;e of my life, &s;ee a place &s;o calculated to bely the opinion one would form of it from the ea&s;tern tales. It appeared to me to be among the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable cities of the world,
<PB N="278" REF="031911_0273_0FEF4B96A8BA0680">
and has no one circum&s;tance that I could di&s;cover to recommend it: the heat is &s;o great, that in the Summer-time the inhabitants are forced to keep their markets in the night, and to lie all night in the open air on the terraces of their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Armenian with whom I re&s;ided, did every thing in his power to render the place agreeable to me; and I &s;hall always retain a lively &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s and ho&s;pitality: he was not only generous and polite, but well informed, and plea&s;ing in con|ver&s;ation. I took occa&s;ion to expre&s;s to him the di&s;appointment I felt at finding Bagdad &s;o very dif|ferent from what I expected; and told him that I had, when a youth, learned to think highly of it, or rather romantically, from reading Ea&s;tern tales. This led to a conver&s;ation on the Arabian Nights Entertainments, a copy of which he had in the Arabic, and produced it: he then &s;hewed me, with great triumph, a French tran&s;lation of them, printed at Paris, which he had read, and declared that the tran&s;lation was nothing at all in compari&s;on with the original. I believe he was well qualified to judge, for he was a perfect ma&s;ter of the French language.</P>
<P>We talked of the Ea&s;tern tale of the Gla&s;s Man, who, in a reverie, increa&s;es his &s;tock till he gets &s;o rich as, in imagination, to marry the Cadi's daugh|ter, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in kicking his wife, kicks all his gla&s;&s;es about, and de&s;troys the whole of his vi&s;ionary fortune.

But the mo&s;t extraor|dinary vi&s;ionary of this kind I ever met with, was one who imagined him&s;elf tran&s;lated to Paradi&s;e, co-equal to Mahomet, and &s;itting by the &s;ide of that prophet, arguing with him in defence of the u&s;e of wine and opium: he argued mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly, li&s;|tened in &s;ilence to the &s;uppo&s;ed arguments of his adver&s;ary, an&s;wered them, replied, rejoined, and &s;till argued on&mdash;till, growing at la&s;t angry, he &s;wore that he was as good a prophet as him, did not care a fig for him, and called him fool and fal&s;e prophet. A Turk who was pre&s;ent, in the fulne&s;s of his zeal, laid a &s;tick very heavily acro&s;s his &s;houlders, and put an end to the vi&s;ion: and never did I &s;ee a wretch &s;o abject, &s;o forlorn, or &s;o mi&s;erably de&s;|ponding; he put his forehead to the ground, which he wet with his tears, crying, Mercy, Mahomet! mercy, holy Prophet! mercy, Alla!&mdash;nor could he find relief (&s;uch is the ruin of opium) till he got a fre&s;h &s;upply of it in his mouth, which &s;oon gave him a temporary re&s;pite from the horrors of his &s;ituation."</P>
<P>Unque&s;tionably, Bagdad was once a great city, of flouri&s;hing commerce; but the Sultan AMURATH the Fourth, when he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, put the riche&s;t Merchants &s;ettled there to death; and it has ever &s;ince gradually declined. About two days journey from it, lie the ruins of the once famous city of Babylon. I was much di&s;po&s;ed to go to &s;ee it, and thence drop down the Euphrates to Ba&s;&s;ora: but my Armenian ho&s;t told me there was nothing in

it to recompen&s;e a per&s;on for half the trouble; for, of that magnificent city, which was &s;ixty miles in circumference, which was encompa&s;&s;ed with walls eighty-&s;even feet in thickne&s;s, and three hundred and fifty in height, nothing was to be &s;een but the bare foundations of &s;ome great edifices. The Tower of Belus, and the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar, lie with the re&s;t in undi&s;tingui&s;hed ruin. The greate&s;t curio&s;ities, then, were, in the fir&s;t place, the ruins of a building &s;aid to be the famed Tower of Babel, which appeared to have been half a league in com|pa&s;s; and the remains of a va&s;t bridge over the Euphrates, where it is half a league broad.</P>
<P>I was not more anxious to arrive at the city of Bagdad than I was to leave it; and having written letters, and put them in a way of being forwarded to Europe, I took leave of my friendly ho&s;pitable Armenian, and, with a thou&s;and acknowledgments for his kindne&s;s, &s;et out on hor&s;eback to a place on the Tigris, where I embarked in a boat, in order to proceed to Ba&s;&s;ora. This river, known &s;ince the fir&s;t records of human exi&s;tence by Geographers, is remarkable for its rapidity, whence, PLINY &s;ays, it has the name of Tigris, (in the Median language, a dart); and for its extraordinary cour&s;e, which is in many places under ground, ri&s;es in Armenia, &s;inks into the earth near mount Taurus, and runs under a mountain&mdash;then ri&s;ing at the other &s;ide, follows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s cour&s;e through the lake The&s;pites&mdash; again &s;inks frequently under ground, and continues hid at one time for a &s;pace of twenty-five miles; where, once more emerging, it glides along with a very rapid &s;tream, meets the Euphrates at a place called Korna, pa&s;&s;es through Ba&s;&s;ora, and falls into the Per&s;ian Gulph.</P>
<P>As the boat in which I took my pa&s;&s;age had no convenience for excluding the violence of the &s;un,
<PB N="281" REF="031911_0276_0FEF4B9D43BC5838">
except an awning, I &s;uffered extremely from the heat. The river it&s;elf was grand; but the banks, and contiguous country, contained nothing to at|tract notice&mdash;no object to diver&s;ify the dreary, de|&s;erted a&s;pect of the &s;cene&mdash;nothing to afford room for reflection, or give birth to a new idea. I do not remember to have ever pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch a va&s;t extent of country, &s;o uniformly dull and unin|tere&s;ting. The only thing that &s;erved to keep the mind alive, was the apprehen&s;ion of robbers, who, in great numbers, hover over this river, and plun|der pa&s;&s;engers. We had taken care, on leaving Bagdad, to be well provided with fire-arms; and they did us yeomen's &s;ervice&mdash;for we were fre|quently attacked by robbers with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> view to plunder, but found that a &s;hot or two di&s;per&s;ed and &s;ent them off in con&s;ternation. One night, however, in pa&s;|&s;ing a creek, we perceived &s;everal boats i&s;&s;uing from it, in great order, and in a manner that evinced method and premeditation: we &s;ilently prepared for their reception, and were completely ready to meet them warmly, while they thought us quite unpre|pared, and uncon&s;cious of their approach: they fir&s;t endeavoured to board us by &s;urpri&s;e: wi&s;hing rather to frighten than to kill them, we began by firing over their heads; on which they &s;et up the mo&s;t horrible &s;houts, and ru&s;hed on with a tumultuous rapidity, making the mo&s;t terrible noi&s;e, in order to intimidate us: they were by this time quite near us; we therefore took aim at them, and let fly, and immediately perceived them in great confu&s;ion, &s;ome of the boats lo&s;ing their helm, and falling with the &s;tream on the others: at la&s;t we &s;aw them &s;hee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> off, and they gave us no farther trouble.</P>

<P>AFTER eight or ten as di&s;agreeable days as I remember to have &s;pent in my life, weakened with ince&s;&s;ant watching, hara&s;&s;ed with bodily fa|tigue, and melted with the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;un, I arrived at the cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Ba&s;&s;ora, where I was received with the utmo&s;t ho&s;pitality by Mr. LATOUCHE, the Company's Re&s;ident from Bombay, who did every thing po&s;&s;ible for my accommodation, and procured me every in&s;truction re&s;pecting my further progre&s;s.</P>
<P>This city, as well as Bagdad, is famous in mar|vellous &s;tory. The country about it is con&s;idered by the natives as the be&s;t &s;pot in A&s;ia, though the burn|ing winds annoy and frequently de&s;troy travellers, overwhelming them with mountains of hot &s;and, driven, like waves of the &s;ea, before the tempe&s;t out of the neighbouring de&s;erts. It carries on a great trade, and is inhabited by va&s;t numbers of Chri&s;tians and Jews. The Engli&s;h and Dutch have factories here, as well for the purpo&s;e of commerce, as the tran&s;it of di&s;patches, by way of Dama&s;cus and Aleppo, to Europe. The riche&s;t merchandi&s;e of India and Europe are brought here in caravans; and its opulence is greatly increa&s;ed by the caravans of Pilgrims, who pa&s;s through it on their way to Mecca, and pay great duties, bartering for many rich commodities. The hor&s;es of this place are celebrated for their &s;upe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r excellence: it is &s;aid

that they will run thirty hours without meat or drink, I doubt the fact, and &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee &s;o inhuman an experiment tried.</P>
<P>One comfortable circum&s;tance attending Ba&s;&s;ora is, that at night the &s;treets may be walked with per|fect &s;afety at all hours. It is &s;ubject to an Arab Prince, who is tributary to the Turk, and who&s;e revenue is very great, as well from the above-men|tioned cau&s;es, as becau&s;e he gives full liberty to all Nations to come and trade to his capital.</P>
<P>From Ba&s;&s;ora I took my pa&s;&s;age in a date-boat going to Mu&s;kat, expecting to get from thence a &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age to Bombay; but the boat &s;prung a leak at &s;ea, and we were obliged to run into Bu&s;heer, where I was very ho&s;pitably received and entertained by Mr. GALLEY, the Company's Re&s;ident.</P>
<P>There really &s;eemed to be an unu&s;ual fatality at|tending me throughout the whole of my journey. You will recollect, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, I was pre|vented, by the war with France, from going by the direct route which I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have taken, and obliged to pa&s;s through the Low Countries and Germany&mdash;In the next place, at Venice I was di&s;|appointed in obtaining a pa&s;&s;age to Latachaea; and, immediately on the heels of that, lo&s;t my &s;ervant at Trie&s;te, by &s;ending him for letters to Venice&mdash;&punc; Afterwards, when I had gone to Alexandria with expectation of travelling through Egypt, and view|ing that intere&s;ting part of the world, I found my&s;elf prevented by the unhappy circum&s;tances of the country&mdash;the plague raging in Alexandria, and all the roads being blocked up by an incur&s;ion of the Arabs. Thus mortified and di&s;appointed, I turned about, in order to make my way in another direc|tion; and arriving at Cyprus, found, to my infinite &s;urpri&s;e and regret, that an epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, little &s;hort of the plague, prevailed there, and &s;wept off

the inhabitants in great numbers: when, after &s;ur|mounting all tho&s;e ob&s;tacles, I arrived at Aleppo, the fir&s;t information I got was, that the caravan was gone, and that it would be a long time before another would be ready; and my departure from Aleppo was attended with circum&s;tances no le&s;s in|au&s;picious than my entrance&mdash;At Mo&s;ul I expe|rienced another di&s;appointment, by the river's being dried up, and rendered impracticable by boats&mdash; My pa&s;&s;age from Ba&s;&s;ora to Mu&s;kat was impeded by the ve&s;&s;el &s;pringing a leak&mdash;And now, when at la&s;t I hoped to get from Bu&s;heer to Bombay, I was &s;topped by the intelligence that the Gulph was blocked up by French privateers, in&s;omuch as no ve&s;&s;el could hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;cape. I was therefore obliged to remain at Bu&s;heer, till a Company's frigate, com|manded by Captain HARDY, and &s;oon expected, &s;hould afford me an opportunity of proceeding to Bombay. Time, however, brought that period about; and I took my pa&s;&s;age, and arrived &s;afe at Bombay, where I &s;oon after embarked on board a Portugue&s;e ve&s;&s;el, being the only conveyance that offered for me to proceed to Madras: &s;he was fir&s;t bound to Goa, and we arrived &s;afely at that i&s;land, where I was received with great politene&s;s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eated with the mo&s;t friendly attention, by Mr. HENSHAW, the Engli&s;h Re&s;ident.</P>
<P>Goa belongs to the Portugue&s;e: the Viceroy of that Nation lives there in great pomp.

<P>I was impatient to get from Goa, and yet I looked forward to my departure with a &s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s,

In vain he endeavoured to cheer me: all he could do was to give me his coun&s;el; in con&s;equence of which I actually &s;ettled all my affairs up to that day, made my will, left it with Mr. HENSHAW, and, full of dreadful forebodings of &s;hipwreck, went on board a Portugue&s;e &s;now bound to Madras.</P>
<P>It was now the eighteenth day of May when we &s;ailed from Goa. The hemi&s;phere had been for &s;ome days overca&s;t with clouds: &s;ome light &s;howers of rain had fallen; and you may conclude that it did not tend to rai&s;e my &s;pirits, or free me from my ominous apprehen&s;ions, to hear that tho&s;e circum|&s;tances indicated an approaching gale of wind. I ob&s;erved, moreover, that the ve&s;&s;el was much too deep in the water, being greatly overloaded&mdash;that &s;he was in many re&s;pects defective, and, as the &s;eamen &s;ay, ill-found, and in &s;hort very unfit to encounter a gale of wind of any violence. I &s;corned, however, to yield to tho&s;e united impre&s;&s;ions, and determined to proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="031911_0281_0FEF4BAD0E429AB0">On the nineteenth, the &s;ky was ob&s;cured by im|men&s;e fleeces of clouds, &s;urcharged with inflam|mable matter; and in the evening, the rain fell in torrents, the firmament darkened apace, &s;udden night came on, and the horrors of extreme dark|ne&s;s were rendered &s;till more horrible by the peals of thunder which rent the air, and the frequent fla&s;hes of lightning, which &s;erved only to &s;hew us the horror of our &s;ituation, and leave us in increa&s;ed darkne&s;s: mean-time the wind became more vio|lent, blowing on the &s;hore; and a heavy &s;ea, rai&s;ed by its force, united with it to make our &s;tate more formidable.</P>
<P>By day-light on the morning of the twentieth, the gale had increa&s;ed to a furious tempe&s;t; and the &s;ea, keeping pace with it, ran mountain-high; and as it kept invariably to the &s;ame point, the Captain and Officers became &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed, and almo&s;t per&s;uaded that the South-we&s;t Mon&s;oon had &s;et in, which, if it were &s;o, would render it ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible for us to weather the coa&s;t. All that day, however, we kept as clo&s;e as the violence of the weather would allow us to the wind; but the &s;ea canted her head &s;o to leeward, that me made more lee than head-way; and the rigging was &s;o &s;trained with the work, that we had little hope of keeping off the &s;hore, unle&s;s the wind changed, of which there was not now the &s;malle&s;t probability. During the night there was no intermi&s;&s;ion of the &s;torm: many of the &s;ails flew into ribbons; &s;ome of the rigging was carried away; and &s;uch exertions were made, that, before morning, every &s;tick that could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;truck was down upon the deck.</P>
<P>About &s;even o'clock on the morning of the twenty-fir&s;t, I was alarmed by an unu&s;ual noi&s;e upon the deck, and running up, perceived that every remaining &s;ail in the ve&s;&s;el, the fore-&s;ail alone ex|cepted,
<PB N="287" REF="031911_0282_0FEF4BAEB3577A78">
was totally carried away. The &s;ight was horrible; and the whole ve&s;&s;el pre&s;ented a &s;pectacle as dreadful to the feelings as mortifying to human pride. Fear had produced, not only all the help|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of de&s;pondency, but all the mi&s;chievous freaks of in&s;anity. In one place &s;tood the Captain, raving, &s;tamping, and tearing his hair in handfuls from his head&mdash;here, &s;ome of the crew were ca&s;t upon their knees, clapping their hands, and pray|ing, with all the extravagance of horror painted in their faces&mdash;there, others were flogging their images with all their might, calling upon them to allay the &s;torm. One of our pa&s;&s;engers, who was Pur&s;er of an Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indiaman, had got hold of a ca&s;e-bottle of rum, and, with an air of di&s;traction and deep de&s;pair imprinted in his face, was &s;talking about in his &s;hirt. I perceived him to be on the point of &s;erving it about, in large tumblers, to the few undi&s;mayed people; and well convinced, that, &s;o far from alleviating, it would &s;harpen the horrors of their mind, I went forward, and with much dif|ficulty prevented him.</P>
<P>Having accompli&s;hed this point, I applied my|&s;elf to the Captain, and endeavoured to bring him back (if po&s;&s;ible) to his recollection, and to a &s;en&s;e of what he owed to his duty as a commander, and to his dignity as a man: I exhorted him to encou|rage the &s;ailors by his example; and &s;trove to rai&s;e his &s;pirits, by &s;aying that the &s;torm did not appear to me by any means &s;o terrible as &s;ome I had before experienced.</P>
<P>While I was thus employed, we &s;hipped a &s;ea on the &s;tarboard &s;ide, which I really thought would have &s;ent us down. The ve&s;&s;el &s;eemed to &s;ink beneath its weight, &s;hivered, and remained motion|le&s;s&mdash;it was a moment of critical &s;u&s;pen&s;e: fancy made me think I felt her gradually de&s;cending&mdash;I

gave my&s;elf up as gone, and &s;ummoned all my for|titude to bear approaching death with becoming manhood.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this cri&s;is, the water, which ru&s;hed with incredible force through all parts of the ve&s;&s;el, brought out floating, and nearly &s;uffocated, another Engli&s;h pa&s;&s;enger, who was endeavouring to take a little repo&s;e in a &s;mall cabin boarded off from the deck: he was a very &s;tout young man, and full of true &s;pirit. Finding that the ve&s;&s;el was not, as I had thought, going immediately down, he joined me in exhorting the captain to his duty: we per|&s;uaded him to throw the guns overboard, as well as a number of trunks and packages with which the ve&s;&s;el was much encumbered; and with &s;ome little exer|tion, we got the pumps &s;et agoing.</P>
<P>Here I will &s;top, knowing the warm &s;en&s;ibility of my FREDERICK's mind; and, convinced that his &s;ympathetic heart will go hand-in-hand with his Father's &s;ufferings, I will not overcharge it with grief by an immediate continuation of the bu&s;ine&s;s, but defer it to another Letter.</P>

He and I having, with great difficulty, got &s;ome hands to &s;tick to the pumps, &s;tood at the wheel, at once to a&s;&s;i&s;t the men, and prevent them from quitting it; and, although hopele&s;s, determined that no effort practicable on our parts &s;hould be wanting to the pre&s;ervation of the ve&s;&s;el. The water, however, gained upon the pumps, notwith|&s;tanding every effort; and it evidently appeared that we could not keep her long above water.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock the wind &s;eemed to increa&s;e, and amounted to a downright hurricane: the &s;ky was &s;o entirely ob&s;cured with black clouds, and the rain fell &s;o thick, that objects were not di&s;cernible from the wheel to the &s;hip's head. Soon the pumps were choaked, and could no longer be worked: then di&s;may &s;eized on all&mdash;nothing but unutterable de&s;|pair, &s;ilent angui&s;h, and horror, wrought up to frenzy, was to be &s;een, not a &s;ingle &s;oul was ca|pable of an effort to be u&s;eful&mdash;all &s;eemed more de&s;irous to extingui&s;h their calamities by embracing death, than willing, by a painful exertion, to avoid it.</P>
<P>At about eleven o'clock we could plainly di&s;tin|gui&s;h a dreadful roaring noi&s;e, re&s;embling that of waves rolling again&s;t rocks; but the darkne&s;s of the day, and the accompanying rains, prevented us from &s;eeing any di&s;tance; and if they were rocks, we might be actually da&s;hed to pieces on them before we could perceive them. At twelve o'clock, how|ever, the weather cleared up a little, and both the wind and the &s;ea &s;eemed to have abated: the very expan&s;ion of the pro&s;pect round the &s;hip was ex|hilerating; and as the weather grew better, and the &s;ea le&s;s furious, the &s;en&s;es of the people returned, and the general &s;tupefaction began to decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>The weather continuing to clear up, we in &s;ome time di&s;covered breakers and large rocks without

&s;ide of us; &s;o that it appeared we mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed quite clo&s;e to them, and were now fairly hemmed in between them and the land.</P>
<P>In this very critical juncture, the Captain, entirely contrary to my opinion, adopted the dangerous re|&s;olution of letting go an anchor, to bring her up with her head to the &s;ea: But, though no &s;eaman, my common &s;en&s;e told me that &s;he could never ride it out, but mu&s;t directly go down. The event nearly ju&s;tified my judgment; for &s;he had &s;carcely been at anchor before an enormous &s;ea rolling over her, overwhelmed and filled her with water, and every one on board concluded that &s;he was certainly &s;inking&mdash;On the in&s;tant, a La&s;car, with a pre&s;ence of mind worthy an old Engli&s;h mariner, took an axe, ran forward, and cut the cable.</P>
<P>On finding her&s;elf free, the ve&s;&s;el again floated, and made an effort to right her&s;elf; but &s;he was almo&s;t completely water-logged, and heeled to lar|board &s;o much that the gunnel lay under water. We then endeavoured to &s;teer as fa&s;t as we could for the land, which we knew could not be at any great di&s;|tance, though we were unable to di&s;cover it through the hazy weather: the fore&s;ail was loo&s;ened; by great efforts in bailing, &s;he righted a little, her gunnel was got above water, and we &s;cudded as well as we could before the wind, which &s;till blew hard on &s;hore; and at about two o'clock the land ap|peared at a &s;mall di&s;tance a head.</P>
<P>The love of life countervails all other con&s;idera|tions in the mind of man. The uncertainty we were under with regard to the &s;hore before us, which we had rea&s;on to believe was part of HYDER ALLI's dominions, where we &s;hould meet with the mo&s;t rigorous treatment, if not ultimate death, was for|gotten in the joyful hope of &s;aving life; and we &s;cudded towards the &s;hore in all the exulting tran&s;|ports

of people ju&s;t &s;natched from the jaws of death.</P>
<P>This gleam of happine&s;s continued not long: a tremendous &s;ea rolling after us, broke over our &s;tern, tore every thing before it, &s;tove in the &s;teerage, car|ried away the rudder, &s;hivered the wheel to pieces, and tore up the very ring-bolts of the deck&mdash;con|veyed the men who &s;tood at the wheel forward, and &s;wept them overboard. I was &s;tanding, at the time, near the wheel, and fortunately had hold of the taf|farel, which enabled me to re&s;i&s;t in part the weight of the wave. I was, however, &s;wept off my feet, and da&s;hed again&s;t the main-ma&s;t. The jerk from the taffarel, which I held very tenaciou&s;ly, &s;eemed as if it would have di&s;located my arms: however, it broke the impetus of my motion, and in all pro|bability &s;aved me from being da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the ma&s;t.</P>
<P>I floundered about in the water at the foot of the ma&s;t, till at length I got on my feet, and &s;eized a rope, which I held in a &s;tate of great embarra&s;&s;ment, dubious what I &s;hould do to extricate my&s;elf. At this in&s;tant I perceived that Mr. HALL had got upon the cap&s;tern, and was waving his hand to me to follow his example: this I wi&s;hed to do, though it was an enterpri&s;e of &s;ome ri&s;k and difficulty; for, if I lo&s;t the hold I had, a &s;ingle motion of the ve&s;&s;el, or a full wave, would certainly carry me overboard. I made a bold pu&s;h, however, and fortunately ac|compli&s;hed it. Having attained this &s;tation, I could the better &s;urvey the wreck, and &s;aw that the water was nearly brea&s;t-high on the quarter-deck, (for the ve&s;&s;el was deep-wai&s;ted); and I perceived the unfortunate Engli&s;h Pur&s;er &s;tanding where the water was mo&s;t &s;hallow, as if watching with patient ex|pectation its ri&s;ing, and awaiting death: I called to him to come to us, but he &s;hook his head in de&s;pair,

and &s;aid, in a lamentable tone, "It is all over with us! GOD have mercy upon us!"&mdash;then &s;eated him|&s;elf with &s;eeming compo&s;ure on a chair which hap|pened to be rolling about in the wreck of the deck, and in a few minutes afterwards was wa&s;hed into the &s;ea along with it, where he was &s;peedily relea&s;ed from a &s;tate ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death.</P>
<P>During this univer&s;al wreck of things, the horror I was in could not prevent me from ob&s;erving a very curious circum&s;tance, which at any other time would have excited laughter, though now it produced no other emotion than &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;We happened to be in part laden with mangoes, of which the i&s;land of Goa is known to produce the fine&s;t in the world; &s;ome of them lay in ba&s;kets on the poop; a little black boy, in the moment of greate&s;t danger, had got &s;eated by them, devouring them voraciou&s;ly, and crying all the time mo&s;t bitterly at the horrors of his &s;ituation!</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el now got completely water-logged; and Mr. HALL and I were employed in forming conjectural calculations how many minutes &s;he could keep above water, and con&s;oling one another on the unfortunate circum&s;tances under which we met&mdash; lamenting that fate had thus brought us acquainted only to make us witne&s;&s;es of each other's mi&s;ery, and then to &s;ee one another no more.</P>
<P>As the larboard &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el was gradually going down, the deck, and of cour&s;e the cap&s;tern, became too nearly perpendicular for us to continue on it: we therefore fore&s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of quitting it, and got upon the &s;tarboard &s;ide, holding fa&s;t by the gunnel, and allowing our bodies and legs to yield to the &s;ea as it broke over us. Thus we con|tinued for &s;ome time: at length the &s;everity of the labour &s;o entirely exhau&s;ted our &s;trength and &s;pirits, that our be&s;t hope &s;eemed to be a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion

to our painful death; and we began to have &s;erious intentions of letting go our hold, and yielding our|&s;elves up at once to the fury of the waves.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el, which all this time drifted with the &s;ea and wind, gradually approximated the &s;hore, and at length &s;truck the ground, which for an in|&s;tant revived our almo&s;t departed hopes; but we &s;oon found that it did not in the &s;malle&s;t degree bet|ter our &s;ituation&mdash;Again I began to yield to utter de&s;pair&mdash;again I thought of letting go my hold, and &s;inking at once: It is impo&s;&s;ible thought I ever to e&s;cape&mdash;why, then, prolong, for a few minutes, a painful exi&s;tence that mu&s;t at la&s;t be given up? Yet, yet, the all-&s;ubduing love of life &s;ugge&s;ted, that many things apparently impo&s;&s;ible had come to pa&s;s; and I &s;aid to my&s;elf, If life is to be lo&s;t, why not lo&s;e it in a glorious &s;truggle? Should I &s;urvive it by accident, life will be rendered doubly &s;weet to me, and I &s;till more worthy of it by per&s;evering fortitude.</P>
<P>While I was employed in this train of reflection, I perceived &s;ome of the people collecting together, talking, and holding a con&s;ultation&mdash;It immediately occurred to me, that they were devi&s;ing &s;ome plan for e&s;caping from the wreck, and getting on &s;hore: and, &s;o natural is it for man to cling to his fellow-creature for &s;upport in difficult or dangerous exi|gences, I propo&s;ed to Mr. HALL to join them, and take a &s;hare in the execution of the plan&mdash;ob&s;erving to him at the &s;ame time, that I was determined at all events to quit the ve&s;&s;el, and tru&s;t to the pro|tection and guidance of a &s;uperintending Providence for the re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>AS prodigality of life is, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the exce&s;s of virtue and courage&mdash;&s;o there are others in which it is vice, meanne&s;s and cowardice. True courage is, according to the circum&s;tances under which it is to operate, as rigidly tenacious and vigi|lant of life in one ca&s;e, as it is indifferent and re|gardle&s;s in another; and I think it is a very &s;trange contradiction in the human heart (although it often happens), that a man who has the mo&s;t unbounded courage, in &s;eeking death even in the cannon's mouth, &s;hall yet want the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;olution to make exertions to &s;ave his life in ca&s;es of ordinary danger. The unfortunate Engli&s;h Pur&s;er could not collect courage &s;ufficient to make an effort to &s;ave him&s;elf; and yet I think it probable that he would have faced a battery of artillery, or expo&s;ed him&s;elf to a pi&s;tol-&s;hot, if occa&s;ion required, as &s;oon as any other man. Thus it appears at fir&s;t view: but may not this &s;eeming incongruity be explained by &s;aying, that per&s;onal courage and fortitude are different qualities of the mind and body, and depend upon the exerci&s;e of entirely different functions?</P>
<P>Be that as it may, I argued with my&s;elf, in the height of my calamitous &s;ituation, upon the &s;ubject of fortitude and dejection, courage and cowardice; and, notwith&s;tanding the &s;erious a&s;pect of affairs, found my&s;elf li&s;tening to the &s;ugge&s;tions of pride:
<PB N="295" REF="031911_0290_0FEF32731AC93938">
What a paltry thing to yield, while &s;trength is left to &s;truggle! Vanity her&s;elf had her hint, and whi&s;|pered, "Should I e&s;cape by an effort of my own, what a glorious theme of exultation!" There were, I confe&s;s, tran&s;itory images in my mind, which, co|operating with the natural attachment to &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation, made me per&s;evere, and re&s;olve to do &s;o, while one ve&s;tige of hope was left for the mind to dwell on.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving, as I told you before, the people con|&s;ulting together, and re&s;olving to join them, I made an effort to get to the lee &s;hrouds, where they were &s;tanding, or rather clinging; but before I could ac|compli&s;h it, I lo&s;t my hold, fell down the hatchway (the gratings having been carried away with the long-boat), and was for &s;ome minutes entangled there among&s;t a heap of packages, which the violent fluctuations of the water had collected on the lee &s;ide. As the ve&s;&s;el moved with the &s;ea, and the water flowed in, the packages and I were rolled together&mdash;&s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes another, up|permo&s;t; &s;o that I began to be apprehen&s;ive I &s;hould not be able to extricate my&s;elf: by the mere&s;t ac|cident, however, I gra&s;ped &s;omething that lay in my way, made a vigorous &s;pring, and gained the lee &s;hrouds. Mr. HALL, who followed me, in &s;eizing the &s;hrouds, came thump again&s;t me with &s;uch vio|lence that I could &s;carcely retain my hold of the rigging. Compelled by the perilous &s;ituation in which I &s;tood, I called out to him for GOD's &s;ake to keep off, for that I was rendered quite breathle&s;s and worn out: he generou&s;ly endeavoured to make way for me, and, in doing &s;o, unfortunately lo&s;t his hold, and went down under the &s;hip's &s;ide. Never, never &s;hall I forget my &s;en&s;ations at this melancholy incident&mdash;I would have given millions of worlds that I could have recalled the words which made

him move; my mind was wound up to the la&s;t pitch of angui&s;h: I may truly &s;ay, that this was the mo&s;t bitter of all the bitter moments of my life, compared with which the other circum&s;tances of the &s;hipwreck &s;eemed le&s;&s;ened&mdash;for I had in&s;en&s;ibly ac|quired an unu&s;ual e&s;teem and warm attachment for him, and was doubtful whether, after being even the innocent occa&s;ion of his falling, I ought to take further pains to pre&s;erve my own life. All tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations were pa&s;&s;ing with the rapidity of lightning through my thoughts, when, as much to my a&s;toni&s;h|ment as to my joy, I &s;aw him borne by a returning wave, and thrown among the very packages from which I had but ju&s;t before, with &s;uch labour and difficulty, extricated my&s;elf&mdash;In the end he proved equally fortunate, but after a much longer and harder &s;truggle, and after &s;u&s;taining much more injury.</P>
<P>I once more changed my &s;tation, and made my way to the poop, where I found my&s;elf rather more &s;heltered&mdash;I earne&s;tly wi&s;hed Mr. HALL to be with me, whatever might be my ultimate fate&mdash;and beckoned to him to come to me; but he only an|&s;wered by &s;haking his head, in a feeble, de&s;ponding manner&mdash;&s;taring at the &s;ame time wildly about him: even his &s;pirit was &s;ubdued; and de&s;pair, I per|ceived, had begun to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind.</P>
<P>Being a little more at ea&s;e in my new &s;tation than I had been before, I had more time to deliberate, and more power to judge. I recollected, that, ac|cording to the cour&s;e of time, the day was far gone, and the night quickly approaching: I reflected, that for any enterprize what&s;oever, day was much pre|ferable to night; and above all I con&s;idered, that the ve&s;&s;el could not hold long together&mdash;I therefore thought, that the be&s;t mode I could adopt would be, to take to the water with the fir&s;t boyant thing
<PB N="297" REF="031911_0292_0FEF4BC605753F50">
I could &s;ee; and, as the wind and water both &s;eemed to run to the &s;hore, to take my chance in that way of reaching it. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, I tore off my &s;hirt, having before that thrown off the other parts of my dre&s;s&mdash;I looked at my &s;leeve but|tons, in which was &s;et the hair of my departed chil|dren&mdash;and, by an involuntary act of the imagination, a&s;ked my&s;elf the que&s;tion, "Shall I be happy enough to meet them where I am now about to go? &mdash;&s;hall tho&s;e dear la&s;t remains, too, become a prey to the devouring deep?"&mdash;In that in&s;tant, rea&s;on, &s;u&s;pended by the horrors of the &s;cene, gave way to in&s;tinct; and I rolled my &s;hirt up, and very care|fully thru&s;t it into a hole between decks, with the wild hopes that the &s;leeve buttons might yet e&s;cape untouched. Watching my opportunity, I &s;aw a log of wood floating near the ve&s;&s;el, and, waving my hand to Mr. HALL as a la&s;t adieu, jumped after it. Here, again, I was doomed to aggravated hard&s;hips &mdash;I had &s;carcely touched the log when a great &s;ea &s;natched it from my hold: &s;till as it came near me, I gra&s;ped at it ineffectually, till at la&s;t it was com|pletely carried away, but not before it had cut and battered and brui&s;ed me in &s;everal places, and in a manner that at any other time I &s;hould have thought dreadful.</P>
<P>Death &s;eemed inevitable; and all that occurred to me now to do, was to accelerate it, and get out of its pangs as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible; for, though I knew how to &s;wim, the tremendous &s;urf rendered &s;wim|ming u&s;ele&s;s, and all hope from it would have been ridiculous. I therefore began to &s;wallow as much water as po&s;&s;ible; yet, &s;till ri&s;ing by the boyant principle of the waves to the &s;urface, my former thoughts began to recur; and whether it was that, or natural in&s;tinct, which &s;urvived the temporary impre&s;&s;ions of de&s;pair, I know not&mdash;but I endea|voured
<PB N="298" REF="031911_0293_0FEF4BC92B3C8AE0">
to &s;wim, which I had not done long, when I again di&s;covered the log of wood I had lo&s;t float|ing near me, and with &s;ome difficulty caught it: hardly had it been an in&s;tant in my hands, when, by the &s;ame unlucky means, I lo&s;t it again. I had often heard it &s;aid in Scotland, that if a man will throw him&s;elf flat on his back in the water, lie quite &s;traight and &s;tiff, and &s;uffer him&s;elf to &s;ink till the water gets into his ears, he will continue to float &s;o for ever: this occurred to me now, and I deter|mined to try the experiment; &s;o I threw my&s;elf on my back in the manner I have de&s;cribed, and left my&s;elf to the di&s;po&s;al of providence; nor was it long till I found the truth of the &s;aying&mdash;for I floated with hardly an effort, and began for the fir&s;t time to conceive &s;omething like hopes of pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>After lying in this manner, committed to the di&s;|cretion of the tides, I &s;oon &s;aw the ve&s;&s;el&mdash;&s;aw that it was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance behind me. Live|lie&s;t hope began to play about my heart, and joy fluttered with a thou&s;and gay fancies in my mind: I began to form the favourable conclu&s;ion, that the tide was carrying me rapidly to land from the ve&s;&s;el, and that I &s;hould &s;oon once more touch <HI>terra firma.</HI></P>
<P>This expectation was a cordial that revived my exhau&s;ted &s;pirits: I took courage, and left my&s;elf &s;till to the &s;ame all directing Power that had hitherto pre&s;erved me, &s;carcely doubting that I &s;hould &s;oon reach the land. Nor was I mi&s;taken; for, in a &s;hort time more, without effort or exertion, and without once turning from off my back, I found my&s;elf &s;trike again&s;t the &s;andy beach. Overjoyed, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, to the highe&s;t pitch of tran&s;port at my providential deliverance, I made a convul&s;ive &s;pring, and ran up a little di&s;tance on the &s;hore; but was &s;o weak and worn down by fatigue, and &s;o unable to clear my &s;tomach of the &s;alt water with which it was

<P>THAT admirable man, and &s;agacious pene|trating philo&s;opher, Dr. FRANKLIN, has left us, among innumerable in&s;tructions for the conduct of human life, and for remedying many of the grievan|ces of it, directions for going a voyage at &s;ea, and has particularly enforced the folly of quitting &s;hips ha&s;tily, and yielding one's &s;elf up to de&s;pair. I am convinced, that nine tenths of the people who peri&s;h by &s;hipwreck, peri&s;h from the want of pre&s;ence of mind, and &s;ufficient fortitude to bear them out. The unhappy pur&s;er, who &s;at deliberately in a chair, and &s;uffered him&s;elf, without a &s;truggle, to be car|ried overboard, is an in&s;tance in point. The feeble conduct of the captain and crew is another. Had he, in&s;tead of tearing his hair, raving, and acting the part a bedlamite, encouraged his men, and taken vigorous mea&s;ures in time; and had they, in&s;tead of whimpering prayers on their knees, and whipping their images, made all clear, and prepared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the wor&s;t; in &s;hort, had they, according to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> moral of the old fable, put their &s;houlder to the wheel, in|&s;tead of calling on Hercules, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but the ve&s;&s;el might have been &s;aved.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="031911_0295_0FEF4AC94EECA9D8">As for my part, the joy of e&s;caping immediate death made me blind to the other mi&s;eries of my &s;ituation. Naked, moneyle&s;s and friendle&s;s, upon an unknown, and probably inho&s;pitable coa&s;t, what rea&s;onable cau&s;e had I to rejoice? Perhaps the re|ver&s;e. But that remains to be &s;een.</P>
<P>How long I continued in the &s;woon into which I had fallen, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to tell; but, when I recovered, I found my&s;elf &s;urrounded by a guard of armed &s;oldiers, &s;epoys, and pikemen. I knew them immediately to be the troops of HYDER ALLI, and almo&s;t wi&s;hed my&s;elf back into the waves again. Looking round, I &s;aw that the people and effects that had been &s;aved from the wreck were collected all together along with me.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate we remained till it was dark. A La&s;car <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Natives of India, employed &s;ometimes as &s;ailors, &s;ometimes for inferior offices in the army, &s;uch as pitching tents, drawing guns, &amp;c.</NOTE> belonging to the ve&s;&s;el, perceiving that my nakedne&s;s gave me great concern, tore into two a piece of cloth which he had tied round his wai&s;t, and gave me one part of it, which afforded a &s;hort apron. This &s;imple act of a poor, uninformed black man, whom chri&s;tian charity would call an idolator, methought had more of the true and e&s;&s;ential &s;pirit of charity in it, than half the o&s;tentatious, parading new&s;paper public charities of London&mdash;the &s;lough of pur&s;e-proud vanity, and unwieldy bloated wealth. Of all the acts of beneficence that I ever met with, it &s;truck me the mo&s;t forcibly: it had kindne&s;s, di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s and delicacy for its ba&s;is; and I have never &s;ince thought of it without wi&s;hing that I could meet the man, to reward him for his beneficence with a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for life. The lower order of people of a certain country, I know, would think a

<P>The va&s;t quantity of &s;alt water I had &s;wallowed, &s;till made me deadly &s;ick in the &s;tomach: however, after &s;ome time, I threw it up, and got great relief. I had hardly felt the comfortable effects of this, be|fore I was ordered to march: nine of us, all La&s;cars except my&s;elf, were conveyed to a village at a few miles di&s;tance on the &s;ea-&s;ide, where we were for the night put into a &s;quare place, walled round, open to the inclemency of the weather above and below, and filled with large logs of wood; it blew mo&s;t vio|lently, and the rain fell in torrents&mdash;while not one &s;mooth plank could be found on which to &s;tretch our fatigued and wa&s;ted bodies. Thus, naked, &s;ick, exhau&s;ted with fatigue and fa&s;ting, drenched with wet, and unable to lie down, our mi&s;ery might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be incapable of increa&s;e. But, alas! where are the bounds which we can &s;et to human woe?&mdash;Thir&s;t, that mo&s;t dreadful of pains, oc|ca&s;ioned by the drenching with &s;alt water, &s;eized us: we begged, we entreated, we clamoured for water; but the inhuman wretches, deaf to the groans and &s;creeches of their fellow-creatures, (for &s;ome grew delirious with the agony of thir&s;t), refu&s;ed them even the cheap and mi&s;erable indulgence of a drop of water!</P>
<P>The influence of the mind upon the body has been much in&s;i&s;ted on by philo&s;ophers and phy|&s;icians, and I believe will be admitted by all wi&s;e men. I was my&s;elf in this in&s;tance, a &s;triking proof of it; for, though I had &s;wallowed and thrown up &s;o much &s;alt water, though my thir&s;t had exceeded any thing I had ever before felt&mdash;yet, finding that water was not to be had or expected, I compo&s;ed my mind to do without it, diverted my thoughts from it by the contemplation of the many other evils
<PB N="302" REF="031911_0297_0FEF32808A0E47A0">
which be&s;et me, and pa&s;&s;ed the night without that horrible agony experienced by the others.</P>
<P>Indeed, a night of more exqui&s;ite horror cannot be imagined. The thoughts of being a pri&s;oner to HYDER ALLI, was, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficient to render me completely unhappy&punc; but my utter want of clothes almo&s;t put me be&s;ide my&s;elf; and lying ex|po&s;ed to the open air, where I was glad to &s;it clo&s;e to the La&s;cars to receive a little heat from their bodies, and to hold open my mouth in order to catch a drop of the de&s;cending rain, was a &s;tate that might be con&s;idered as the highe&s;t refinement upon mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>About four o'clock in the morning, a little cold rice was brought us to eat, and water was dug out of a hole near the &s;pot for us; but as all things in this life are good or bad merely relatively, this wretched fare was &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me refre&s;hment to us. I was then removed to the ruins of a toddy-hut,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;mall temporary hut, where <HI>toddy</HI> (a liquor extracted from the cocoa-nut tree) is &s;old.</NOTE> &s;eparated from the re&s;t, and a guard &s;et over me. Here I had full room for reflection, and could "meditate e'en to madne&s;s," The whole of my &s;ituation appeared before me with all its aggravating circum&s;tances of horror; and to any one who con&s;iders it, I believe it will appear that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to fill the bitter cup of calamity fuller. Oh! what were my thoughts! My family bereft of him on who&s;e efforts they were in a great mea&s;ure to depend for &s;upport and protection&mdash;you, then a little innocent cherub, appeared to my di&s;tracted imagination twining round your mother's neck, and, in infant clamour, calling your father&mdash;while he, in a dreadful captivity, com|pared with which even a cruel death were mercy, lay wa&s;ting, naked and forlorn, peri&s;hing with the

inclemency of the weather, wanting even food fit for his &s;upport, and expo&s;ed to the &s;courge of every petty tyrant that barbarous power might employ to guard him!&mdash;Such were my reflections: they were in rea&s;on well founded; for there was no probability of my being ever relea&s;ed, as my captivity was un|likely to be known to my country, or by my friends.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate I was, when, to my utter a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and to my no le&s;s joy, the amiable companion of my &s;hipwreck, Mr. HALL, appeared before me. I &s;carcely knew how to think his appearance reality, as I under&s;tood that the La&s;cars then along with me were all that were &s;aved from the wreck; and he was, at the time I parted from him, &s;o exhau&s;ted both in body and mind, that I thought he would be the la&s;t who could e&s;cape. He, however, &s;hook me by the hand; and, &s;itting down, told me that he had given me up for lo&s;t, and remained with the ve&s;&s;el until the tide, having ebbed, left her almo&s;t dry&mdash;that, immediately on getting a&s;hore, and being taken pri&s;oner, he made inquiries about me, and heard that I had been &s;aved&mdash;that, finding this, his joy was &s;uch as to make him almo&s;t forget his own misfortunes&mdash;and, exerting all his entreaties not to be &s;eparated from me, they had been &s;o far indul|gent to him, and had brought him to me, that we might be companions in bondage. He added, that out of eleven Europeans and fifty-&s;ix La&s;cars who were on board, only he and I of the former, and fourteen of the latter, were &s;aved from the wreck, the re&s;t having been drowned in the attempt, ex|cepting &s;ome who, overcome with terror, angui&s;h and anxiety, and exhau&s;ted with fatigue, had bid a formal adieu to their companions, let go their hold, and calmly and voluntarily given them&s;elves up to the deep.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="031911_0299_0FEF3283E218BE98">I here took occa&s;ion to remark to him, what I have already &s;aid to you, that thou&s;ands lo&s;e their lives for want of pre&s;everance, fortitude, and cou|rage, to pre&s;erve them&mdash;Had the Engli&s;h Pur&s;er collected courage enough to hold fa&s;t till the tide ebbed, he might have been &s;afe on &s;hore as we were, as he was &s;uperior to either of us in bodily &s;trength.</P>
<P>"Ah! my friend!" &s;aid he, &s;haking his head de&s;pondingly&mdash;"is he wor&s;e where he is? I doubt whether death is not far preferable to our pre&s;ent pro&s;pects."</P>

<P>In fact, our joy at meeting was reciprocally great, and in &s;ome re&s;pect cheered us for the time under all our mi&s;eries in hand, and the dreary pro&s;pect of tho&s;e yet to come.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR letter, occa&s;ioned by the account of my &s;hipwreck and &s;ub&s;equent di&s;a&s;ter, gave me, my amiable boy! as great plea&s;ure as tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters gave me pain. Your account, too, of JOHN's bur&s;t|ing into tears on the reading of it to him, had almo&s;t a &s;imilar effect upon my&s;elf: and I tru&s;t in the Al|mighty di&s;po&s;er of events, that that excellent turn of mind will be &s;o fa&s;hioned by the education I give you, as to make it the &s;ource of boundle&s;s gratifica|tion and true greatne&s;s (by which I mean goodne&s;s) here, and of never-fading felicity hereafter. You &s;ay you cannot account for it, but you found more happine&s;s at my e&s;cape, than mi&s;ery at my misfor|tunes. I hail that circum&s;tance as the &s;tronge&s;t mark of perfect excellence of di&s;po&s;ition. A great moral philo&s;opher has laid it down as a maxim, that it is the &s;urer mark of a good heart to &s;ympathi&s;e with joy than with &s;orrow; and this in&s;tance only comes in aid of that opinion of you which my fond hopes have always nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t declare to you, that my plea&s;ure at e&s;caping &s;hipwreck was by no means as great as the agony my mind underwent at the pro&s;|pect now before me was poignant. I have already &s;aid, and indeed with truth, that I &s;hould have with much greater plea&s;ure embraced death: I, who had been already &s;ome years in India, and had oppor|tunities

of hearing, as well from my father as from other officers in the &s;ervice, what the di&s;po&s;ition of the tyrant in who&s;e power I had now fallen was, knew too well the horrors of my &s;ituation to feel any thing like hope. The unmerciful di&s;po&s;ition of HYDER<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and all tho&s;e in authority under him, and the cruel policy of the Ea&s;tern chiefs, making the life of any one, particularly a Briti&s;h pri&s;oner, at the be&s;t a precarious tenure, I did not know the moment when death might be inflicted upon me with perhaps a thou&s;and aggravating circum&s;tances: and at all events, the affairs which demanded my pre&s;ence in India &s;o very importunately as to urge me to all the fatigues and hard&s;hips of a pa&s;&s;age over land, were, of them&s;elves, &s;ufficient to make my mind unea&s;y; but the abject &s;tate of want and nakedne&s;s in which it &s;eemed I was likely to remain, &s;truck a deep and damp horror to my heart, and al|mo&s;t unman'd me.</P>
<P>Mr. HALL and I, however, endeavoured with all our might to &s;tem the headlong torrent of our fate&mdash; Melancholy preyed deeply and openly upon him, while I concealed mine, and endeavoured to cheer the &s;inking &s;pirits of that noble youth, who, I per|ceived was the prey rather of extreme &s;en&s;ibility than feeblene&s;s of mind. All the horrors of &s;hiver|ing nakedne&s;s, though, to a mind delicate like his, and a per&s;on reared in the lap of luxury, &s;ufficiently goading, appeared as nothing when compared with one lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained in the depredations wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which &s;hipwreck is con&s;tantly followed up. In the cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e between life and death, which I have already de&s;cribed, previous to my getting on &s;hore, this amiable young man had &s;ecured and trea&s;ured next his heart, as the in&s;eparable companion of his fate, a miniature portrait of a young lady; it hung round his neck, and was, by the unfeeling villains
<PB N="307" REF="031911_0302_0FEF4BD8CAC9F680">
who &s;eized him on his landing, taken away. This cruel deprivation was an ince&s;&s;ant corro&s;ive to his mind&mdash;the copious &s;ource of angui&s;h to his heart&mdash; the hourly theme of the mo&s;t pathetic, afflicting ex|clamations. "Had I," he would cry, "oh! had I had but the good fortune to have gone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the bot|tom while yet it hung about my neck, I &s;hould have been happy: but now, &s;eparated from the heavenly original, and bereft of the precious image, what is life? what would be life were I yet &s;ure of it? What plea&s;ure, what common content, has the world left for me? None&mdash;oh! none, none! Never &s;hall this heart again know comfort!</P>
<P>I did every thing I could to con&s;ole him, and, as far as I could, prevent him from dwelling on tho&s;e gloomy &s;ubjects. Our conver&s;ations were intere&s;t|ing and pathetic; but, alas! the picture, at every pau&s;e, cha&s;ed away the &s;light impre&s;&s;ions of the preceding conver&s;e: no &s;ufferings of the body could countervail that lo&s;s&mdash;no con&s;olation mitigate it; and amid&s;t the horrid reflections which unparalleled calamity impo&s;ed upon his mind, the lo&s;s of that one dear relic ro&s;e paramount to all&mdash;and as every thought began, &s;o it ended, with the picture.</P>
<P>For &s;ome days we lay in this place, expo&s;ed to the weather, without even the &s;lender comfort of a little &s;traw to cover the ground beneath us&mdash;our food, boiled rice, &s;erved very &s;paringly twice a-day by an old woman, who ju&s;t threw a handful or more of it to each upon a very dirty board, which we devoured with tho&s;e &s;poons nature gave us.</P>
<P>At the end of that time, we, and, along with us, the La&s;cars, were ordered to proceed into the country, and drove on foot to a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, in order to render up an account of our&s;elves to per&s;ons belonging to government, authori&s;ed to take it. It was advanced in the morning when we
<PB N="308" REF="031911_0303_0FEF4BDA5AA793F0">
moved, without receiving any &s;ort of &s;u&s;tenance; and were marched in that wa&s;ting climate eight hours, without breaking our fa&s;t; during which time we were expo&s;ed alternately to the &s;corching heat of the &s;un and heavy torrents of rain, which rai&s;ed painful bli&s;ters on our &s;kin: we had often to &s;tand expo&s;ed to the weather, or to lie down, under the pre&s;&s;ure of fatigue and weakne&s;s, on the bare ground; then wait an hour, or more, at the door of &s;ome in|&s;olent, unfeeling, mon&s;ter, until he fini&s;hed his din|ner, or took his afternoon's nap; and when this was over, drove forward with wanton barbarity by the people who attended us.</P>
<P>You, my FREDERICK! who only know the mild and merciful di&s;po&s;ition of the people of Great Bri|tain, where government, religion, and long habit, have reduced charity and benevolence &s;o completely to a &s;y&s;tem that they &s;eem to be innate principles of the mind, can have no conception of a people who will not only look upon the wor&s;t human afflictions with indifference, but take a &s;avage delight in the mi&s;eries of their fellow-creatures, even where no po&s;&s;ible advantage can be reaped from their inhu|manity, and where the only reward they can propo&s;e to them&s;elves for their cruelty is the plea&s;ure of contemplating human &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Such, &s;orry am I to &s;ay it, is the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome parts of the Ea&s;t Indies that I have been in; and although tho&s;e parts under the dominion of Great Britain owe their emancipation from the mo&s;t galling yokes to the Engli&s;h&mdash;and though, under their au&s;pices, they live in a &s;tate of greater hap|pine&s;s than ever they did, and greater freedom even than Britons them&s;elves&mdash;yet &s;uch is the wicked in|gratitude of many of them, &s;uch the inflexible ani|mo&s;ity ari&s;ing from a contradictory religion, that the death or &s;uffering of an Engli&s;hman, or any mis|fortune

that may befal him, often &s;erves only as matter of &s;port or amu&s;ement to them. It would be well if it re&s;ted there&mdash;but unfortunately they are wor&s;e again; for in general they have the like cold|ne&s;s and indifference, or indeed, to &s;peak more pro|perly, the like aver&s;ion, to each other's good, and the &s;ame diabolical principles of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and treachery pervade the greater number in tho&s;e va&s;t regions, almo&s;t boundle&s;s in exte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and almo&s;t matchle&s;s in fertility.</P>
<P>Two days after this, we were moved again, and marched up the country by a long and circuitous route, in which we underwent every hard&s;hip that cruelty could inflict, or human fortitude endure&mdash; now bli&s;tered with the heat, now drenched with the rain, and now chilled with the night damps&mdash;de&s;ti|tute of any place but the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re earth to re&s;t or lay our heads on, with only a &s;canty pittance of boiled rice for our &s;upport&mdash;often without water to quench our thir&s;t, and con&s;tantly goaded by the guards, who pricked us with their bayonets every now and then, at once to evince their power, entertain the &s;pectators, and mortify us. We arrived at Hyder|nagur, the metropolis of the province of Biddanore &mdash;a &s;ort of con&s;iderable &s;trength, mounting upwards of &s;eventy guns, containing a large garri&s;on of men, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e wealth.</P>
<P>It was about two o'clock in the morning when we arrived at Biddanore: the day was extremely hot, and we were kept out under the full heat of that broiling &s;un till &s;ix o'clock in the evening, before we were admitted to an audience of the Jemadar, or governor of the place, without having a mouthful of victuals offered to us after the fatiguing march of the morning.</P>
<P>While we &s;tood in this forlorn &s;tate, a va&s;t con|cour&s;e of people collected about, and viewed us with
<PB N="310" REF="031911_0305_0FEF4BDF2F9C5EA8">
curio&s;ity. Looking round through tho&s;e who &s;tood neare&s;t, I ob&s;erved &s;ome men gazing at me with &s;trong marks of emotion, and a mixture of wonder and concern pourtrayed in their countenances. Sur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch &s;ymptoms of humanity in a My|&s;orian Indian, I looked at them with more &s;crutiniz|ing attention, and thought that their faces were familiar to me. Catching my eye, they looked at me &s;ignifican<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as though they would expre&s;s their regard and re&s;pect for me, if they dared; and I then began to recollect that they were formerly privates in my regiment of cavalry, and were then pri&s;oners at large with HYDER.</P>
<P>I was not le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed that tho&s;e poor fellows &s;hould recogni&s;e me in my pre&s;ent mi&s;erable fallen &s;tate, than affected at the &s;ympathetic fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing they di&s;clo&s;ed. I returned their look with a private nod of recognition; but, &s;eeing that they were afraid to &s;peak to me, and fearing I might injure them by di&s;clo&s;ing our acquaintance, I forbore any thing more. The guilty &s;ouls of de&s;potic governments are perpetually alive to &s;u&s;picion: every look alarms them; and alarm or &s;u&s;picion never fails to be fol|lowed up with pro&s;cription or death.</P>
<P>Men, when in the fullne&s;s of power and pride of office, very &s;eldom give them&s;elves time to reflect upon the in&s;tability of human greatne&s;s, and the un|certainty of earthly contingencies. When, inve&s;ted with all the trappings of authority, I commanded the regiment to which tho&s;e poor fellows belonged, I would have thought that he &s;poke wildly indeed who would have alledged that it was po&s;&s;ible I could ever become an object of their pity&mdash;that I &s;hould &s;tand naked and degraded before them, and they be afraid to acknowledge me: but, though I &s;hould have thought &s;o then, it was yet &s;ome comfort to me, when that unfortunate event did come to pa&s;s,

to reflect, that, when in power, I made &s;uch u&s;e of it as to excite emotions in their bo&s;oms of affection and re&s;pect.

He de&s;ired to know, who I was?&mdash;what my profe&s;&s;ion was?&mdash;what was the cau&s;e and manner of my approaching the country of HYDER ALLI?&mdash;To all tho&s;e que&s;tions I gave an&s;wers that &s;eemed to &s;atisfy him. He then a&s;ked me, what news I had brought with me from Europe? &mdash;inquired into the &s;tate of the army, and number of recruits di&s;patched in the &s;hips of that &s;ea&s;on&mdash;was minute and circum&s;tantial in his que&s;tions re&s;pecting the nature and &s;ucce&s;s of the war in Europe&mdash;and examined me clo&s;ely, touching the re&s;ources of the Ea&s;t India Company. I &s;aw his drift, and was cautious and circum&s;pect in my an&s;wers, and at the &s;ame time contrived to &s;peak with an air of candour that in &s;ome &s;ort &s;atisfied him.</P>
<P>Having exhau&s;ted his whole &s;tring of que&s;tions, he turned the di&s;cour&s;e to another &s;ubject&mdash;no le&s;s than his great and pui&s;&s;ant Lord and Ma&s;ter, HYDER, of whom he had endeavoured to impre&s;s me with a great, if not terrible idea&mdash;amplifying his power, his wealth, and the extent and opulence of his domin|ions&mdash;and de&s;cribing to me, in the mo&s;t exaggerated terms, the number of his troops&mdash;his military talents &mdash;his va&s;t, and, according to his account, unrivalled genius&mdash;his amazing abilities in conquering and governing Nations&mdash;and, above all, his many ami|able qualities, and &s;plendid endowments of heart, no le&s;s than under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Having thus, with equal zeal and fidelity, en|deavoured to impre&s;s me with veneration for his Lord and Ma&s;ter, and for that purpo&s;e attributed to him every perfection that may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be divi|ded among all the Kings and Generals that have lived &s;ince the birth of CHRIST, and given each their due, he turned to the Engli&s;h Government, and endeavoured to demon&s;trate to me the folly and inutility of our attempting to re&s;i&s;t his progre&s;s,

He then vaunted of his Sovereign's &s;ucce&s;&s;es over the Engli&s;h, &s;ome of which I had not heard of be|fore, and did not believe; and concluded by a&s;&s;uring me, that it was HYDER's determination to drive all Europeans from Indo&s;tan, which he averred he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l to do, con&s;idering the weakne&s;s of the on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and boundle&s;s power of the other.

<P>After having expended near half an hour in this manner, he called upon me to come over near him, and cau&s;ed me to &s;eat my&s;elf upon a mat with a pillow to lean upon&mdash;encouraged me, by every means he could, by the mo&s;t gentle accents, and the mo&s;t &s;oothing, mollifying language, to &s;peak to him with|out the lea&s;t re&s;erve&mdash;exhorted me to tell him the truth in every thing we &s;poke of&mdash;and hinted to me, that my falling into his hands might turn out the mo&s;t fortunate event of my life.</P>
<P>I was at a lo&s;s to what motive to attribute all tho&s;e &s;ingular marks of indulgence; but found that he had learned who&s;e &s;on I was, and knew my father by reputation from the pri&s;oners, our Sepoys, who were now pri&s;oners at large here: and as rank and office are the chief recommendation in the Ea&s;t, as well as el&s;where, or rather much more than any where el&s;e, the &s;agacious HYAT SAHIB found many claims to e&s;teem and humanity in me as the &s;on of a Colonel CAMPBELL, which he never would have found in me had I been the &s;on of a plain humble farmer or trade&s;man in England.</P>

<P>If I was mi&s;erable b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fore, this intimation entirely de&s;troyed the la&s;t remnant of peace or hope.

<P>That night the Jemadar &s;ent me an excellent &s;up|per, of not le&s;s than &s;ix di&s;hes, from his own table; and although I had been &s;o long fami&s;hing with the want of whole&s;ome food, the idea of being enli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of HYDER &s;truck me with &s;uch horror that I lo&s;t all appetite, and was &s;carcely able to eat a

mouthful. Mr. HALL and I, however, were &s;epera|ted from the La&s;cars, who were relea&s;ed and forced to work.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the favourable intentions mani|fe&s;ted towards me by the Jemadar, as I have already mentioned, no mark of it what&s;oever appeared in our lodging. This con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;mall place, exactly the &s;ize of our length and breath, in the zig-zag of one of the gates of the citadel: it was open in front, but covered with a kind of a &s;hed on the top; and a number of other pri&s;oners were about us: each of us was allowed a mat and pillow, and this formed the whole of our local accommodations. Upon my re|marking it, we were told, that in conformity to the cu&s;tom of the Circar,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Country or Province.</NOTE> we mu&s;t be treated &s;o for &s;ome time, but that our accommodations would afterwards be extended, and made more agreeable to our wi&s;hes: even this was better than our &s;ituation &s;ince we landed.</P>
<P>In addition to this luxury, we were allowed to the value or four pence halfpenny a day for our mainte|nance; and a guard of Sepoys was put over us and a few more pri&s;oners, one of whom was directed to go and purcha&s;e our victuals, and do &s;uch like offices for us.</P>
<P>This guard was changed every week&mdash;a &s;trong mark of the &s;u&s;picious and wary tempers of tho&s;e people, who could f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar intrigues and cabals between wretched pri&s;oners like us and their &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>In two or three days after this, HYAT SAHIB &s;ent for me, treated me with great kindne&s;s, gave me &s;ome tea, and furni&s;hed me with two or three &s;hirts, an old coat, and two pairs of breeches, which were &s;tripped from the dead bodies that were thrown a&s;hore from the wreck&mdash;every thing that was &s;aved

At this interview he treated me with great re&s;pect&mdash;gave me, be&s;ides the articles already mentioned, thirty rupees&mdash;and, upon my going away, told me that in a few days a very flattering propo&s;al would be made to me, and that my &s;ituation would be rendered not only com|fortable, but enviable.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s to you, my dear FREDERICK! the horror I felt at the idea of this intended propo&s;al&mdash;for I knew but too well what it meant. It was the &s;ource of bitter mi&s;ery to my mind: neverthele&s;s, I determined to re&s;i&s;t every effort that &s;hould be made, whether blandi&s;hment, intreaty, or menace&mdash;to lay down my life it&s;elf, though in ob&s;curity, with honour&mdash;and to carry along with me, go where I would, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done my duty.</P>
<P>I have in the cour&s;e of my life met with many people, who, under the plau&s;ible pretext of liberality and greatne&s;s of mind, have called them&s;elves citi|zens of the world, and declared that the country where they lived, be that what country it might, was their's, and demanded their allegiance and pro|tection: but I have always &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected, that &s;uch men act from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being outca&s;ts of their own country&mdash;and, &s;corned and rejected by their fellow-citizens, would retaliate by affecting to deny their natural attachment. There are men who neither love father, mother, &s;i&s;ter, brother, or con|nection: &s;uch, however, are, thank GOD! very thinly &s;own in this world; but, except it be a few &s;uch unnatural people, I am convinced that there is no one who&s;e heart does not confe&s;s the patriotic pa&s;&s;ion, and burn with a flame, more or le&s;s ardent, of love for his country. My predilections that way are naturally &s;trong, and I am now happy to reflect that I evinced them by the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs:

<P>ON the evening of that day on which the Jemadar HYAT SAHIB had honoured me with an audience, given me clothes and money, and inform|ed me that a propo&s;al, which he called flattering, would be made to me, I was &s;ent for to attend, not at the Durbar, but at the hou&s;e of a man high in office. As I expected to meet HYAT SAHIB him|&s;elf, and trembled at the thoughts of his expected propo&s;ition, I was &s;urpri&s;ed, and indeed plea&s;ed, to find that it was with one of his people only I was to have a conference. This man, who&s;e name I now forget, received me with great kindne&s;s, encouraged me, made me &s;it down with him, and began to &s;peak of HYAT SAHIB, whom he extolled to the &s;kies, as a per&s;on endowed with every great and amiable quality; informing me at the &s;ame time, that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the friend&s;hip and confidence of his ma&s;ter, HYDER ALLI, in a greater degree than any other per&s;on&mdash;TIPPOO SAHIB, his own &s;on, not ex|cepted:
<PB N="320" REF="031911_0315_0FEF4BFBC5BCEAF8">
he then gave me the private hi&s;tory of HYAT&mdash;&s;aying, that he was born a Gentoo prince, of one of the provinces of the Malabar coa&s;t, which had fallen beneath the irre&s;i&s;tible arms of HYDER, and had been by him annexed to the va&s;t My&s;orean Empire. HYAT, he &s;aid, was then only a boy of eleven or twelve years of age, of a mo&s;t promi&s;ing genius, and a quickne&s;s of mind unu&s;ually met with in one of tho&s;e tender years. HYDER, who was in all re&s;pects a man of unrivalled penetration, thought he &s;aw in the boy that which, if properly cultivated, would turn out of va&s;t u&s;e to a &s;tate; and as, in all Mahomedan governments, unconnected, i&s;olated boys, oft-times &s;laves, are bred up in the &s;eraglio to &s;ucceed to the great offices of the &s;tate, HYDER adopted the boy, had him made a Mahomedan, and, in fact, treated him as if he had been the i&s;&s;ue of his own loins, and brought him up with all the affection and tenderne&s;s of a fond parent. I am the more particular in &s;tating this part of HYAT's hi&s;|tory to you, as &s;ome re&s;pectable hi&s;torians, deceived by erroneous report, have &s;aid that he was the illegi|timate offspring of HYDER. The &s;ultan, however, was not di&s;appointed in the expectations he had formed; for HYAT SAHIB had, in zeal, fidelity and attachment, as well as in intellectual faculties and talents for governing, even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t hopes of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Having given me this conci&s;e account of the Jemadar, he proceeded to inform me, that the Arcot Sepoys, whom I have before mentioned to you, had di&s;covered to HYAT SAHIB who I was, given him a full account of my family, and informed him that I had commanded a regiment of cavalry in the &s;ervice of the Nabob of Arcot, together with a corps of infantry and artillery attached to it. In con&s;equence of this report, HYAT SAHIB, he &s;aid,
<PB N="321" REF="031911_0316_0FEF4C00CD565A38">
had inter&s;ted him&s;elf very warmly in my favour, and expre&s;&s;ed an anxious de&s;ire to render me a &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Thus far the di&s;cour&s;e plea&s;ed me. Nothing was &s;aid in it to give me alarm; on the contrary, I in|dulged a hope, that, knowing my rank, and the rank of my father, he would no longer entertain a hope of my entering into the &s;ervice of HYDER, and, for the time I was to be impri&s;oned, treat me with &s;uitable indulgence. But I flattered my&s;elf too &s;oon; or, as the old &s;aying is, "reckoned without my ho&s;t."</P>
<P>When he had fini&s;hed his hi&s;tory of HYAT SAHIB, which he overcharged with ful&s;ome panegyric, he told me, with a face full of that triumphant impor|tance which one who thinks he is conferring a great favour generally a&s;&s;umes, that it was the intention of HYAT SAHIB, for and on behalf of his ma&s;ter the Sultan, to give me the command of five thou&s;and men&mdash;an offer which he &s;uppo&s;ed I could not think of declining, and therefore expected no other an&s;wer but a profu&s;ion of thanks, and &s;trong manife&s;tations of joy on my part.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe to you my di&s;|may at this formal propo&s;al, or pourtray to you the various emotions that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my brea&s;t. Re&s;entment had its &s;hare&mdash;the pride of the &s;oldier, not unaccompanied with the pride of family and rank, while it urged me to &s;purn from me &s;uch a ba&s;e accommodation, made me con&s;ider the offer as a great in&s;ult. I therefore pau&s;ed a little, to &s;up|pre&s;s my feelings; and then told him my firm re|&s;olution, never to accept of &s;uch a propo&s;al; and upon his expre&s;&s;ing great a&s;toni&s;hment at my declin|ing a &s;tation &s;o fraught with advantage, I laid down, in the be&s;t manner I could, my rea&s;ons; and I mu&s;t &s;ay, that he li&s;tened to all the objections I &s;tarted
<PB N="322" REF="031911_0317_0FEF4C025D3FA7D8">
with great patience; but, in the conclu&s;ion, &s;aid he had little doubt of finding means to overcome my reluctance.</P>
<P>He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me for the pre&s;ent, and I returned to my pri&s;on, where I related to my companion, Mr. HALL, every thing that pa&s;&s;ed between us: we canva&s;&s;ed the matter fully, and he agreed with me, that it was likely to turn out a mo&s;t dreadful and cruel per&s;ecution. It was on this occa&s;ion that I fir&s;t felt the truth of the principle, that per&s;ecution never fails to be &s;ubver&s;ive of its own end, and to promote that which it is intended to de&s;troy. There is, in the human mind, an innite abhorrence of com|pul&s;ion; and per&s;ecution always gives new &s;trength and ela&s;ticity to the &s;oul; and at la&s;t, when &s;trained to its utmo&s;t extent, makes man &s;urmount difficul|ties which at fir&s;t &s;eem to be beyond the reach of humanity.</P>
<P>Piqued by the idea of per&s;ecution, I began to feel a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m which I was before a &s;tranger to: I looked forward, with a kind of gloomy plea&s;ure, to the mi&s;eries that brutal tyranny might inflict upon me, even to death it&s;elf; and al|ready began to indulge the exultation of martyrdom. "No," &s;aid I, "my dear HALL! never will I tar|ni&s;h the character of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier&mdash;never will I di&s;grace my blood or my profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;never &s;hall an act of mine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ully the pure fame of my revered father &mdash;never &s;hall any &s;ufferings of mine, however poig|nant, or worldly advantage, however &s;eductive, tempt me to do that which his noble &s;pirit would regard with horror or contempt. I may, and I fore|&s;ee I mu&s;t be mi&s;erable; but I never will be ba&s;e or degenerate!" Indeed, I had wrought my&s;elf up to &s;uch a pitch of firmne&s;s, that I am per&s;uaded the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and refined cruelties which the in|genuity
<PB N="323" REF="031911_0318_0FEF4C05A2539900">
of an Iroquois Indian could have inflicted on my body, would have been utterly incapable of bending the &s;tubborn temper of my mind.</P>
<P>The place in which we were lodged was &s;ituated in a way not very favourable to our feelings. Ju&s;t within &s;ight of it, the commandant of the citadel held a court&mdash;by him y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lep'd a court of ju&s;tice&mdash; where the mo&s;t &s;hocking, barbarous cruelties were hourly exerci&s;ed&mdash;mo&s;t of them for the purpo&s;e of extorting money, and compelling the di&s;covery of hidden, or &s;uppo&s;itious hidden trea&s;ures. Indeed, five &s;ixths of tho&s;e who &s;uffered were of this de&s;cription; and the proce&s;s pur&s;ued was as artful as barbarous: they fir&s;t began with care&s;&s;es, then proceeded to ex|amination and cro&s;&s;-examination, thence to threats, thence to puni&s;hment, and, finally, to the mo&s;t cruel tortures.</P>
<P>Directly oppo&s;ite to us, was impri&s;oned an un|fortunate per&s;on, who had for years been a clo&s;e captive, and the &s;port and &s;ubject of tho&s;e enormi|ties. He was a man once of the highe&s;t rank in the country where now he was a pri&s;one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for a &s;eries of years he had been governor and &s;ole manager of the whole province of Bidanore. This was during the reign of the la&s;t Rana, or Queen, who&s;e family had been &s;overeigns of the country for time immemorial, till HYDER made a conque&s;t of, and annexed it to his other u&s;urpations. Unfortunately for him, he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have ama&s;&s;ed and &s;ecreted enormous trea&s;ures, in con&s;equence of which he had already undergone the fiery ordeal of torture &s;everal times. He was &s;uppo&s;ed to have produced, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, about fifteen lacks of pagodas; and then, in the cour&s;e of eighteen months, was degraded gra|dually, from the high re&s;pect in which he was at fir&s;t held, down to a mo&s;t abject &s;tate&mdash;threatened, flog|ged, puni&s;hed in a variety of ways, and, finally, put
<PB N="324" REF="031911_0319_0FEF4C0732D21DD8">
to the mo&s;t cruel tortures. I my&s;elf &s;aw him treated with the highe&s;t degree of re&s;pect, and afterwards brought to the lowe&s;t &s;tage of mi&s;ery and humilia|tion. One thing, however, I mu&s;t not forget, is the fortitude with which he and all of them bore their puni&s;hment: it was truly heroic&mdash;indeed, be|yond all belief. Nothing could &s;urpa&s;s it, except the &s;kill and inventive ingenuity which the barba|rians exhibited in &s;triking out new modes of torture. My &s;oul &s;ickened with horror at the &s;ight: the amiable HALL could wor&s;e &s;upport it than his own mi&s;eries, and lo&s;t all that fortitude, in his feeling for others' misfortunes, which he di&s;played in &s;o unbounded a &s;hare in his own: and often, very often, we found the rigour and &s;everity of our own &s;ituation utterly forgotten in our angui&s;h and &s;ym|pathy for the &s;ufferings of others. Never &s;hall I for|get it: never &s;hall I think without horror of the ac|cur&s;ed policy and wicked tyranny of the Ea&s;tern go|vernments, where every &s;en&s;e of humanity is extin|gui&s;hed, and man, more mercile&s;s than the tiger, riots in the blood of his fellow-creatures without cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. HALL, notwith&s;tanding the various &s;ufferings both of mind and body which he had undergone, began to recruit, and get a little better; and this circum&s;tance, of it&s;elf, diffu&s;ed a flow of &s;pirits over me that contributed to my &s;upport. We con&s;oled each other by every means we could devi&s;e&mdash;&s;ome|times indulging in all the luxury of woe&mdash;&s;ometimes rallying each other, and, with ill-di&s;&s;embled &s;pright|line&s;s, calling on the godde&s;s EUPHROSYNE to come with her "<HI>quirps and cranks, and wreathed &s;miles:</HI>" but, alas! the mountain nymph, &s;weet LIBERTY, was far away, and the godde&s;s &s;hunned our abode. We however began to conceive that we might form a &s;y&s;tem for our relief, and by a methodical arrange|ment,
<PB N="325" REF="031911_0320_0FEF4C0AC3743B48">
entrench our&s;elves from the a&s;&s;aults of grief: to this end, we formed &s;everal re&s;olutions, and en|tered into certain engagements&mdash;&s;uch as, never to repine at our fate, <HI>if we could</HI>&mdash;to draw con&s;olation from the more dreadful lot of others, <HI>if we could;</HI> &mdash;and to encourage hope&mdash;hope that comes to all; and, on the whole, to confine our conver&s;ation as much as po&s;&s;ible to &s;ubjects of an agreeable nature: but the&s;e, like many other rules which we lay down for the conduct of life, were often broken by nece&s;|&s;ity, and left us to regret the fallibility of all human precautionary &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>The youth and &s;trength of Mr. HALL was to the full as adequate as mine to the &s;upport of any per|&s;onal hard&s;hip: his intellectual powers were excel|lent, his temper incomparable, and his fortitude unparalleled; yet could I &s;ee, that &s;omething more than appeared upon the &s;urface wrought within him, and gnawed his heart with hidden pain. United as we were by &s;entiment, as well as by parity of &s;uffer|ing, I felt for him too deeply, not to have an in|tere&s;ting curio&s;ity to know what it was that preyed upon his mind: we had now been, months together, fellow-&s;ufferers; and I thought my&s;elf not without &s;ome claim to his confidence&mdash;I told him &s;o, and de&s;ired him to impart to me his &s;tory; which he, with his accu&s;tomed &s;uavity and conde&s;cen&s;ion, agreed to&mdash;a&s;&s;uring me that it was not &s;uch a &s;tory as could requite the trouble of hearing it, or intere&s;t any one but him&s;elf, or &s;ome very warm friend in|deed: &s;uch, however, he added, he took me to be; and, as &s;uch, would tell it to me. I think it, how|ever, worth relating, and will give it to you in his own words; and, though it be very &s;hort, mu&s;t defer the relation to another letter.</P>

<P>"Although you are now, my dear friend! a wit|ne&s;s to my being the mo&s;t perfectly wretched of all created beings, yet the time is not long pa&s;t when for|tune &s;miled upon and gave me promi&s;e of as much happine&s;s as Man in this wretched vale of tears is al|lowed by his circum&s;cribed nature to hope for. I have &s;een the time, when each revolving &s;un ro&s;e to u&s;her me to a day of joy, and &s;et to con&s;ign me to a night of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e&mdash;when the bounties of Nature, and the productions of Art, were poured with the profu&s;ion of fond paternal affection into my lap&mdash;when troops of friends hailed my ri&s;ing pro&s;pects&mdash;when health and peace made this per&s;on their uninterrupted abode&mdash;and when the mo&s;t be|nignant love that ever ble&s;&s;ed a mortal filled up the mea&s;ure of my bli&s;s. Yes, CAMPBELL! it was once my happine&s;s, though now, alas! the &s;ource of poignant mi&s;ery, to be ble&s;&s;ed with the be&s;t parents that ever watched over the welfare of a child&mdash;with friends, too, who loved me, and whom my heart cheri&s;hed&mdash;and&mdash;O God! do I think of her, and yet retain my &s;en&s;es&mdash;with the affections of a young

lady, than whom providence, in the fullne&s;s of its power and bounty to mankind, never formed one more lovely, one more angelic in per&s;on, more heavenly in di&s;po&s;ition, more rich in intellectual endowments. Alas! my friend, will you, can you pardon tho&s;e warm ebullitions of a fond pa&s;&s;ion? will you for a moment enter into my feelings, and make allowance for tho&s;e tran&s;ports? But how can you? Your friend&s;hip and pity may indeed induce you to excu&s;e this interruption; but, to &s;ympathi&s;e truly, and feel as I feel, you mu&s;t have known the charming girl her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"My father, though he did not move in the very fir&s;t walk of life, held the rank of a Gentleman by birth and education, and was re&s;pectable, not only as a man of con&s;iderable property, but as a per&s;on who knew how to turn the gifts of fortune to their be&s;t account: he was generous without prodigality, and charitable without o&s;tentation: he was allowed by all who knew him to be the mo&s;t tender of hu&s;bands&mdash; the mo&s;t zealous and &s;incere of friends; and I can b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r witne&s;s to his being the be&s;t of parents. As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng as I can remember to have been able to make a remark, the tenderne&s;s of both my father and mother knew no bounds: I &s;eemed to occupy all their thoughts, all their attention; and in a few years, as I thank God I never made an un&s;uitable return for their affection, it increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that their exi&s;tence &s;eemed to hang upon mine.</P>
<P>"To make as much of a child &s;o beloved as his natural talents would allow, no expence was &s;pared in my education: from childhood, every in&s;truc|tion that money could purcha&s;e, and every allure|ment to learn that fondne&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t, were be&s;towed upon me; while my beloved father tracing the advances I made with the magnifying eye of
<PB N="328" REF="031911_0323_0FEF4C131897AF50">
affection, would hang over me in rapture, and enjoy by anticipation the fame and honours that, overweening fondne&s;s &s;ugge&s;ted to him, mu&s;t one day &s;urround me. The&s;e prejudices, my dear friend! ari&s;ing from the exce&s;s of natural affection, are ex|cu&s;eable, if not amiable, and de&s;erve a better fate than di&s;appointment. Alas! my honoured father, you little knew&mdash;and, oh! may you never know, what &s;ort of fame, what &s;ort of honours, await your child! May the angui&s;h he endures, and his mo&s;t calamitious fate, never reach your ears!&mdash;for, too well I know, 'twould give a deadly wrench to your heart, and precipitate you untimely to your grave.</P>
<P>"Thus years rolled on; during which, time &s;eemed to have added new wings to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">light, &s;o quickly did they pa&s;s. Unmarked by any of tho&s;e &s;ini&s;ter events that parcel out the time in weary &s;tages to the unfortunate, it &s;lid on unperceived; and an enlargement in my &s;ize, and an increa&s;e of knowledge, were all I had to inform me that eigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en years had pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>"It was at this time that I fir&s;t found the &s;moo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h current of my tranquillity interrupted, and the ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of my feelings &s;welled and agitated, by the acce&s;&s;ion of new &s;treams of &s;en&s;ation&mdash;In &s;hort I became a &s;lave to the delicious pains of Love; and, after having borne them in concealment for a long time, at length collected courage to declare it. Frankne&s;s and candour were among the virtues of my beloved: &s;he li&s;tened to the prote&s;tations of affection, and, ri&s;ing above the little arts of her &s;ex, avowed a reciprocal attachment. The mea&s;ure of my bli&s;s &s;eemed now to be full; the purity of my pa&s;&s;ion was &s;uch, that the thoughts of the gro&s;&s;er animal de&s;ires never once occured; and happy in loving, and being beloved, we pa&s;&s;ed our time in all the in|nocent blandi&s;hments which truly virtuous love in|&s;pires,
<PB N="329" REF="031911_0324_0FEF4C16115CF240">
without our imagination roaming even for an in&s;tant into the wilds of &s;en&s;uality.</P>
<P>"As I was to inherit a genteel, independent fortune, my father propo&s;ed to breed me up to a learned profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;the Law; rather to invigorate and exerci&s;e my intellects, and as a &s;tep to rank in the &s;tate, than for mere lucrative purpo&s;es. I was put to one of the univer&s;ities, with an allowance &s;uited to his intentions towards me&punc; and was imme|diately to have been &s;ent to travel for my further im|provement, when an unfore&s;een accident happened, which immediately cru&s;hed all my fathers views, da&s;hed the cup of happine&s;s from my lips, and brought me ultimately to that deplorable &s;tate in which you have now the misfortune to be joined along with me.</P>
<P>"It was but a few months antecedent to my embarking for the ea&s;tern world,, that my father, whom I had for &s;ome time with &s;orrow ob&s;erved thoughtful, &s;tudious and melancholy, took me into his &s;tudy, and, &s;eizing my hand, and looking ear|ne&s;ty into my face, while his countenance betrayed the violent agitation of his mind, a&s;ked me empha|tically, if I thought I had fortitude to bear the great|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible calamity? I was horror-&s;truck at his emotion, accompanied by &s;uch a que&s;tion&mdash;but re|plied, I hoped I had. He then a&s;ked me if I had affection enough for him to forgive him if he was the cau&s;e of it? I an&s;wered, that the idea connected with the word <HI>forgivene&s;s,</HI> was that which I could ne|ver be brought by any earthly circum&s;tance to apply to my father; but begged him at once to di&s;clo&s;e the wor&s;t to me&mdash;as, be it what it might, my mi&s;ery could not &s;urpa&s;s what I then felt from the my&s;terious man|ner in which he then &s;poke.</P>
<P>"He then told me that he was an undone man&mdash; that he had, with the very be&s;t intentions, and with the view of aggrandizing me, engaged in great and
<PB N="330" REF="031911_0325_0FEF4C179DE4EC70">
important &s;peculations, which, had they &s;ucceeded, would have given us a princely fortune&mdash;but, having turned out, unfortunately, the rever&s;e, had left him little above beggary. He added, that he had not the re&s;olution to communicate his lo&s;&s;es to me, until nece&s;&s;ity compelled him to tell me all the truth.</P>
<P>"Although this was a &s;evere &s;hock to me, I en|deavoured to conceal my feelings from my father, on who&s;e account, more than on my own, I was af|fected, and pretended to make as light of it as &s;o very important a misfortune would ju&s;tify; and I had the happine&s;s to perceive that the worthy man took &s;ome comfort from my &s;uppo&s;ed indifference. I conjured him not to let &s;o very trivial a thing as the lo&s;s of property, which could be repaired, break in on his peace of mind or health, which could not; and ob&s;erved to him, that we had all of us &s;till enough&mdash;for that my private property (which I po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed independent of him, and which a relation left me) would amp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;upply all our nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>"Having thus endeavoured to accommodate my unhappy father's feelings to his lo&s;&s;es, I had yet to accommodate my own; and began to revolve in my mind what was likely to en&s;ue from, and what &s;tep was mo&s;t proper to be taken, in this dreadful change of circum&s;tances. That which lay neare&s;t my heart fir&s;t occurred;&mdash;you will readily gue&s;s that I mean my love; to involve her I loved more, far more, than my life, in the misfortunes of my family, was too horrible a con&s;ideration to be outweighed even by the dread of lo&s;ing her. I knew not what to do, and I thought upon it till I became almo&s;t enfrenzied &mdash;In this &s;tate I went to her, and unfolded the whole &s;tate of our concerns, together with my re&s;olution not to involve her in our ruin;&mdash;when&mdash;can you be|lieve it?&mdash;the lovely girl in&s;i&s;ted on making my fate indi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olubly her's&mdash;not, as &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he had the
<PB N="331" REF="031911_0326_0FEF4C1C2E820568">
&s;malle&s;t apprehen&s;ion lap&s;e of time or change of cir|cum&s;tance could make an alteration in our affection, but that &s;he wi&s;hed to give my mind that repo&s;e which I might derive from &s;ecurity. This I would by no means accede to; and, for the pre&s;ent, we contented our&s;elves with mutual vows of eternal fidelity.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as I thought my father's mind fit for &s;uch a conver&s;ation, I opened to him a plan I had formed of coming to India, to advance my fortune. His under&s;tanding approved of it, but his heart di&s;|&s;ented; and he &s;aid, that to part with me would give the fini&s;hing &s;troke to his misfortunes: but, as my intere&s;t was tolerably good, I repre&s;ented to him the great likeli&s;hood I had of &s;ucce&s;s; and at la&s;t, with &s;ome difficulty, he con&s;ented.</P>
<P>"My next &s;tep was to acquaint Mi&s;s &mdash; with my re&s;olution. I purpo&s;ely pa&s;s over a meeting which no power of language can de&s;cribe!&mdash;then how can I?&mdash;Oh! CAMPBELL, the remembrance of it gnaws me like a vulture here," (and he put his hand upon his heart, while the tears rolled down his cheeks), "and will &s;oon, &s;oon bring me to my end.</P>
<P>"Not to detain you with vain efforts to de&s;cribe all our feelings, I will confine my&s;elf to telling you, that after having made every nece&s;&s;ary preparation, and divided with my much honoured parents the little property I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, I &s;et &s;ail for India, in a &s;tate of mind compared with which the horrors of annihila|tion would have been enviable: the chaos in my thoughts made me in&s;en&s;ible to every object but one; and I brooded with a &s;ort of &s;tupid, gloomy indulg|ence, over the portrait of Mi&s;s &mdash;, which hung round my neck, and was my in&s;eperable companion, till the people who &s;eized me as I came a&s;hore plun|dered me of it, and thereby deprived me of the la&s;t refuge for comfort I had left. Oh! mon&s;ters! bar|barians! had you glutted your &s;avage fury by di&s;&s;e|vering
<PB N="332" REF="031911_0327_0FEF4C1DC1BACB78">
my limbs, one after another, from my body, it would have been mercy, compared with depriving me of that little image of her I love! But it is all over, and I &s;hall &s;oon &s;ink into the grave, and never more be ble&s;&s;ed with the view of tho&s;e heavenly fea|tures, till we meet in that region where all tears are wiped away, and where, I tru&s;t, we &s;hall be joined together for endle&s;s ages, in eternal, never-fading bli&s;s!"</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LII.</HEAD>
<P>ON the day &s;ucceeding that on which the agent of HYAT SAHIB had held the di&s;cour&s;e with me, mentioned in my la&s;t letter but one, I was again &s;ent for, and brought to the &s;ame per&s;on, who a&s;ked me, whether I had duly con&s;idered of the important offer made me by HYAT SAHIB, and of the con&s;e|quences likely to re&s;ult from a refu&s;al? and he ap|pri&s;ed me at the &s;ame time, that the command of five thou&s;and men was an honour which the fir&s;t Ra|jahs in the My&s;orean dominions would gra&s;p at with tran&s;port. I told him I was well convinced of the honour &s;uch a command would confer on any man but an Engli&s;hman, who&s;e country being the object of HYDER's ince&s;&s;ant ho&s;tility, would make the ac|ceptance of it infamy&mdash;that although I knew there were but too many Engli&s;hmen apo&s;tates to their country, I hoped there were but few to be found in India willing to accept of any emoluments, hower
<PB N="333" REF="031911_0328_0FEF4C1F529650E8">
great, or any temptations, however &s;pecious, to fly from the &s;tandard of their country, and rally round that of its bittere&s;t enemy&mdash;that, for my own part, being of a name ever foremo&s;t in the ranks of loyalty and patrioti&s;m, and of a family that had hitherto de|tracted nothing from the honours of that name, &s;uch an act of apo&s;tacy would be peculiarly infamous in me, and I could view it in no better light than trai|torous and parricidal&mdash;that, independent of all tho&s;e claims, which were of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to deter me, I felt within my&s;elf a principle, perhaps innate, perhaps in&s;pired by military habit, that forbade my acceding&mdash;and, finally, appealed to the good &s;en&s;e of HYAT SAHIB, whether a man who in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances had betrayed his country, and &s;acrificed her intere&s;ts to his own convenience, was &s;uch a per&s;on as confidence could properly be put in.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e, and a thou&s;and other re|mon&s;trances, which I cannot immediately recollect, but which the hazards of my &s;ituation &s;ugge&s;ted, he &s;till continued to pre&s;s me, and u&s;ed every argu|ment, every per&s;ua&s;ion, that ingenuity could dictate, or hints of puni&s;hment enforce, to &s;hake my pur|po&s;e&mdash;but in vain: attachment to country and family ro&s;e paramount to all other con&s;iderations; and I gave a peremptory, deci&s;ive refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tanced as I was, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to keep an accurate journal of the various incidents that pa&s;&s;ed, or vici&s;&s;itudes of thought that occurred, during the period of my impri&s;onment. Indeed, I was &s;carcely con&s;cious of the length of my captivity, and could not, till I was relea&s;ed, determine exactly how long it had continued. You mu&s;t therefore content your&s;elf to be told in general terms, that I was repeatedly urged on the &s;ubject by fair per&s;ua|&s;ives: they then had recour&s;e to menace; then they withheld the daily pittance allowed for my &s;upport;
<PB N="334" REF="031911_0329_0FEF4C2255506FA8">
and at length proceeded to coercion, tying a rope round my neck, and hoi&s;ting me up to a tree. All this, however, I bore firmly: if it had any effect, it was to confirm me in my re&s;olution, and call in policy to the aid of honour's dictates. Every man of feeling or rea&s;on mu&s;t allow, that it was better to die, than live a life of &s;ubjection to tyranny &s;o truly diabolical.</P>
<P>Mr. HALL and I, thus drove to the brink of ex|tinction, yet con&s;oled our&s;elves with the reflection, that tho&s;e whom mo&s;t we loved were not &s;haring our unhappy fate, and were fortunately ignorant of our &s;ufferings; and as I enjoyed perfect good health, hope yet lived within me.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pring, an ela&s;ticity, in every man's mind, of which the owner is rarely, very rarely con&s;cious, becau&s;e fortunately the occa&s;ions &s;eldom occur in which it can be brought to the proof; for, as la&s;&s;itude is the nece&s;&s;ary forerunner of refre&s;h|ment, &s;o is extreme dejection to the mo&s;t vigorous exerci&s;e of our fortitude. So I found it: as the hor|rors of my &s;ituation thickened round me, I felt my &s;pirits increa&s;e; my re&s;olution became more firm, my hopes more &s;anguine&mdash;I even began to look for|ward, and form projects for the future: whole hours amu&s;ement, every day and every night, aro&s;e from the contemplation of my beloved boy; I in imagi|nation traced his growth, directed his ri&s;ing &s;enti|ments, formed plans for his future &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;|perity, and indulged by anticipation in all the en|joyment which I now tru&s;t I &s;hall yet have in his ripened manhood.</P>
<P>Thus we continued for many months, during which no alteration what&s;oever took place in our treatment or &s;ituation. We heard a thou&s;and con|tradictory reports of victories gained over the Eng|li&s;h, and again of &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es on their part: they,
<PB N="335" REF="031911_0330_0FEF4C26B71516E8">
however, de&s;i&s;ted to pre&s;s me into their &s;ervice. The only relief from our &s;ufferings lay in the re|&s;ources of our own minds, and in our mutual endea|vours to plea&s;e and con&s;ole one another: the cir|cum&s;tances of aggravation were the nece&s;&s;ity of daily bearing witne&s;s to the mo&s;t barbarous puni&s;hments inflicted upon wretched individuals under the &s;em|blance of ju&s;tice, and the occa&s;ional deprivation of our food, either by the fraud of the &s;epoys who at|tended us, or the caprice or cruelty of their &s;upe|riors. It is but ju&s;tice, however, to &s;ay, that they were not all alike: &s;ome overflowed with mercy, charity, and the milk of human kindne&s;s; while others, again, were almo&s;t as bad men as the &s;o|vereigns they &s;erved. We were not allowed the u&s;e of pen, ink, or paper; and very &s;eldom could afford our&s;elves the luxury of &s;having, or clean linen: nor were we at all &s;heltered from the inclemency of the weather, till at length a little room was built for us of mud, which being &s;mall and damp, rendered our &s;ituation wor&s;e than it was before.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner whom I have already mentioned, as having, in the time of the former &s;overeign, held the fir&s;t office in Bidanore, &s;till continued oppo&s;ite to me; and he and I at length began to under&s;tand each other, and found means, by looks, &s;igns and ge&s;tures, to exchange thoughts, and hold an inter|cour&s;e of &s;entiments together. From the circum|&s;tance of his being a native, and better &s;killed in the language than me, he had much better intelligence than I could po&s;&s;ibly have, and he was always eager to convey to me any circum&s;tance or news that he thought might be agreeable: &s;ome me&s;&s;ages al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed between us, by means of the &s;epoys who had alternately been his guard and mine&mdash;for our guards were changed every week.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="031911_0331_0FEF4C284B75C6E0">Projects and hopes of a new kind now began to intrude them&s;elves on my thoughts; and I conceived a de&s;ign, which I flattered my&s;elf was not entirely impracticable, to effect an e&s;cape, and even a revolt in the place. A variety of circum&s;tances concurred to per&s;uade me, that the tyranny of HYDER, and his &s;ervant HYAT SAHIB, was abhorred, though none dared to give vent to their &s;entiments. I thought I could ob&s;erve, that the native pri&s;oner oppo&s;ite to me was privately beloved, and might, from the re|collection of his former dignities, have con&s;iderable influence in the place. Several Arcot &s;epoys and their officers (&s;ome of them belonging to my own regiment) were al&s;o pri&s;oners at large; and withal I recollected, that difficulties apparently more &s;tupend|ous had been overcome by Engli&s;hmen&mdash;having often heard it a&s;&s;erted, that there was not a pri&s;on in the known world out of which a Briti&s;h &s;ubject had not made his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Fraught with tho&s;e conceptions, I attempted to &s;ound the officers of the Arcot Sepoys, whether it were not po&s;&s;ible for us to effect our e&s;cape? So ardent is the flame of liberty in all men's brea&s;ts, &s;o great is the dete&s;tation of human nature to &s;lavery, that I perceived a manife&s;t willingne&s;s in the people about us to join me in an attempt to procure our liberty, or bring about a revolt in the garri&s;on. My heart beat high with the hope; and I began to flat|ter my&s;elf, that the day was not far removed when we &s;hould not only bid defiance to our tyrants, but even make them repent the day on which we were ca&s;t a&s;hore on their coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus di&s;tantly &s;ounded all who I thought were likely to concur, upon the practicability of the attempt, and found them, as I conceived, di&s;po&s;ed to take &s;hare in it, it yet remained to con&s;ider of the <HI>quomodo</HI>&mdash;and, after having formed the general

outlines of a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, to lick it into &s;hape. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was a critical con&s;ideration: the &s;econd re|quired addre&s;s and management, and was likely to be impeded by the vigilance of the people about, who would not fail to remark, and take the alarm, from any unu&s;ual intercour&s;e or di&s;cour&s;e between us; and without a mutual communication of thoughts, and full deliberation by all parties concerned, as well as knowledge of the fort and its different gates, nothing could, with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, be de|termined&mdash;nothing, without the mo&s;t imminent ha|zard, be attempted. I therefore held various coun|cils with my own mind, and with Mr. HALL, on the &s;ubject&mdash;mo&s;t of which were abortive, without at all di&s;couraging us.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I began to think of &s;ounding the Bidanore pri&s;oner, <HI>ci-devant</HI> governor of the place; and de|termined, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring him into our con&s;ul|tations, as I had before hoped to make him a party in the execution of the project: but while I was &s;et|tling all this much to my own &s;atisfaction, an event occurred which extingui&s;hed all my hopes in that way&mdash;of which you &s;hall have an account in my next letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER the plan which I mentioned in my la&s;t was di&s;covered or not, or from what other motive it aro&s;e, I have not to this day been able to decide; but &s;o it was, that while my &s;anguine mind was overflowing with the hope of carrying my pro|ject for an e&s;cape into effect, Mr. HALL and I were one day unexpectedly loaded with irons, and fa&s;tened together, leg by leg, by one bolt. This, as nearly as I can compute, was four or five months before my relea&s;e. Of all the circum&s;tances of my life, it has made the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind: it unexpectedly and &s;uddenly broke down the mo&s;t plea&s;ing fabric my imagination had ever built. The &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ioned by the appearance of the irons, and the precautionary manner in which it was un|dertaken, was indeed great: &s;till more was I &s;ur|pri&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that the per&s;on who was em|ployed to &s;ee this put in execution, manife&s;ted un|u&s;ual emotions, &s;eemed much affected, and even &s;hed tears as he looked on: and while the &s;udden|ne&s;s and cautionary mode of doing it convinced me that &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance on our part was apprehended, the &s;orrow which the officer who &s;uperintended it di&s;clo&s;ed, portended in my mind a fatal, or at lea&s;t a very &s;erious i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, poor Mr. HALL had for &s;ome time been afflicted with a return of his dreadful di&s;|order,

<P>FOR &s;ome time I was lo&s;t in grief for the death of Mr. HALL. Though I had long expected it, and might con&s;equently be &s;uppo&s;ed to have wa&s;ted great part of my &s;orrow in anticipation; yet, having only con&s;idered and felt the point before his death merely as it re&s;pected him and his misfortunes, a great portion of the calamity yet remained uncon|ceived: and, now that he was dead, I began for the fir&s;t time to con&s;ider and feel the &s;ubject as it con|cerned my&s;elf. Reflection told me, that he was happily relieved from woe, and in a &s;tate of bli&s;s&mdash;
<Q><L>"After life's fitful fever, he &s;leeps well:</L>
<L>"&mdash; Nor &s;teel nor poi&s;on,</L>
<L>"Malice dome&s;tic, foreign levy&mdash;nothing</L>
<L>"Can touch him further!"</L></Q></P>
<P>But I &s;till remained a prey to perhaps new barba|rities, without hope of relief from the old. No part|ner to &s;hare, no &s;ocial conver&s;e to alleviate, no friend to con&s;ole me under my afflictions, I looked at the body of my friend with envy, and lamented that death had not afforded me, too, a &s;helter from the cruelties which fate &s;eemed determined to heap upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="031911_0339_0FEF4C3DF912FE10">It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s to you the agonies of mind I underwent during the re&s;t of the night. In the morning a report was made to the commandant, of the death of Mr. HALL; and in about an hour after, he pa&s;&s;ed me by, but kept his face purpo&s;ely turned away from me to the other &s;ide. I patiently waited for the removal of the dead body till the even|ing, when I de&s;ired the Sepoys who guarded me to apply for its being removed. They returned, and told me that they could get no an&s;wer re&s;pecting it. Night came on, but there was no appearance of an intention to unfetter me from the corp&s;e. The com|mandant was &s;itting in his court, admini&s;tering, in the manner I have before de&s;cribed, <HI>ju&s;tice!</HI> I called out to him my&s;elf with all my might, but could get no an&s;wer from him. Nothing could equal my rage and con&s;ternation&punc; for, exclu&s;ive of the painful idea of being &s;hackled to the dead body of a friend I loved, another circum&s;tance contributed to make it a &s;erious &s;ubject of horror. In tho&s;e climates the weather is &s;o inten&s;ely hot, that putrefaction almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;ucceeds death, and meat that is killed in the morn|ing, and kept in the &s;hade, will be unfit for dre&s;&s;ing at night. In a &s;ubject, then, on which putrefaction had made advances even before death, and which remained expo&s;ed to the open air, the proce&s;s mu&s;t have been much more rapid. So far, however, from compa&s;&s;ionating my &s;ituation, or indulging me by a removal of the body, their barbarity &s;ugge&s;ted to them to make it an in&s;trument of puni&s;hment; and they pertinaciou&s;ly adhered to the mo&s;t mortifying &s;ilence and di&s;regard of my complaints. For &s;everal days and nights it remained attached to me by the irons. I grew almo&s;t di&s;tracted&mdash;wi&s;hed for the means of putting an end to my mi&s;eries by death, and could not move without witne&s;&s;ing &s;ome new &s;tage of putre&s;cence it attained, or breathe without

inhaling the putred effluvia that aro&s;e from it&mdash;while myriads of flies and loath&s;ome in&s;ects re&s;ted on it, the former of which every now and then vi&s;ited me, crawling over my face and hands, and lighting in hundreds on my victuals. I never look back at this cri&s;is without confu&s;ion, horror, and even a&s;toni&s;h|ment; and, were it not connected with a chain of events preceding and &s;ub&s;equent to it, too well known by re&s;pectable people to be doubted, and too much interwoven with a part of the hi&s;tory of the la&s;t war in India to admit of a doubt, I &s;hould not only be afraid to tell, but ab&s;olutely doubt my&s;elf whether the whole was not the illu&s;ion of a dream, rather than credit the po&s;&s;ibility of my enduring &s;uch unheard of hard&s;hips without lo&s;s of life or deprivation of &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when the body had reached that &s;hocking loath&s;ome &s;tate of putrefaction which threatened that further delay would render removal abominable, if not impo&s;&s;ible, the mon&s;ters agreed to take it away from me&mdash;and I was &s;o far relieved: but the morti|fication and injury I underwent from it, joined to the agitation of the preceding week, made a vi&s;ible in|road on my health. I totally lo&s;t my &s;pirits; my appetite entirely for&s;ook me: my long-nouri&s;hed hopes fled; and I looked forward to death as the only de&s;irable event that was within the verge of likelihood or po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>One day, my oppo&s;ite friend (the native pri&s;oner) gave me a look of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and encou|raging kind; and I perceived a more than u&s;ual bu&s;|tle in the citadel, while the &s;epoys informed me that they were ordered on immediate &s;ervice, and that &s;ome events of great importance had taken place. From this feeble gleam, my mind, naturally active, though depre&s;&s;ed by circum&s;tances of unu&s;ual weight, again took fire, and hope brightened with a kind of gloody light the pro&s;pect before me: I revolved a

thou&s;and things, and drew from them a thou&s;and &s;ur|mi&s;es; but all as yet was only conjecture with me. In a day or two, the bu&s;tle increa&s;ed to a high pitch, accompanied with marks of con&s;ternation: the whole of the troops in the citadel were ordered to march; and the commandant, and a man with a hammar and in&s;truments, came to take off my irons.</P>
<P>While they were at work taking off my irons, I perceived they were taking off tho&s;e of the native pri|&s;oner oppo&s;ite to me al&s;o. He went away under a guard: we looked at each other complacently, nod|ded and &s;miled, as who &s;hould &s;ay, "we hope to &s;ee one another in happier times not far di&s;tant." But, alas! vain are human hopes, and &s;hort and dark is the extent of our utmo&s;t fore&s;ight! This un|happy man, without committing any &s;ort of offence to merit it, but in conformity to the damnable, bar|barous policy of tho&s;e countries, was, by the Jema|dar's orders, taken forth, and his throat cut!

<P>In order to elucidate the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to recur to events which happen|ed antecedent to this time, but of which, by rea&s;on of my &s;ituation, I was then entirely ignorant; and as they involve, not only the grounds of my &s;ub&s;equent e&s;cape and proceedings, but a con&s;iderable portion of hi&s;torical fact, and &s;ome of the material intere&s;ts of the Ea&s;t India Company, I will be the more par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cularly careful in relating them, and de&s;ire from you a proportionate &s;hare of attention&mdash;But their im|portance entitle them to a &s;eparate letter: therefore conclude with a&s;&s;uring you, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>HYDER ALLI KHAWN, late Nabob of My&s;ore, and father to the pre&s;ent TIPPOO SAHIR SULTAIN, was as extraordinary a man, and perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as great natural talents, as any recorded in the page of hi&s;tory. Born and bred up in the lowe&s;t ranks of an unenlightened and ignorant people, and to the la&s;t day of his life perfectly illiterate, he not only emerged from his native ob&s;curity by the vigor of his mind and body, but became un object of ter|ror and admiration to &s;urrounding potentates. Early initiated in the habits and inured to the toils of a mi|litary life, he ro&s;e, by the gradual &s;teps of promo|tion, to a rank which afforded an opportunity of di&s;|playing his capacity and prowe&s;s: he &s;oon obtained the command of that army in which he had once &s;erved as a common &s;oldier, and immediately de|mon&s;trated that the &s;ublimity of his mind was formed to keep pace with his extraordinary elevation.</P>
<P>The Marhattas, the mo&s;t formidable people in Hi|ther India, bordered on the My&s;orean dominions, and kept their neighbours, by frequent ho&s;tilities, in a continual &s;tate of awe&mdash;making incur&s;ions on their territories, and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by force of arms, of large portions of their country: but no &s;ooner had HYDER got the command of the armies of his country, than he drove back the Marhattas from the My&s;orean dominions, which he extended by con&s;i|derable
<PB N="348" REF="031911_0343_0FEF4C48E426E200">
acqui&s;itions from the Marhatta frontiers; and followed up his conque&s;ts with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;sful ardour, that he compelled that warlike nation to re&s;|pect his countrymen as their equals, if not &s;uperiors, in military achievement. Thus, while he ingrati|ated him&s;elf with his &s;overeign and fellow-citizens by his wi&s;dom, he acquired the admiration of the &s;oldiery by his per&s;onal addre&s;s and valour; and at the &s;ame time, by the &s;everity of his di&s;cipline, and the occa&s;ional au&s;terity of his deportmet, maintained an awe over them, which &s;trengthened his authority without dimini&s;hing their affection.</P>
<P>HYDER was therefore now arrived at that point of elevation, beyond which no exertion of mental capa|city, if governed by virtue or integrity, could rai&s;e him&mdash;So far he owed all to genius: but his towering ambition looked higher; and, unre&s;trained by any principle of religion or morality, he determined to accompli&s;h, at any rate, that which he knew nothing but crime could accompli&s;h. With wicked deliber|ation he looked forward into the womb of time, and with unparalleled policy arranged the whole &s;y&s;tem upon which he was to act, when that order of things his penetrating and intuitive genius enabled him to &s;ee would naturally ari&s;e from each other, &s;hould af|ford him a proper opportunity. Although he was utterly ignorant of books, and of cour&s;e could derive little benefit from the examples of the great and am|bitious men recorded in hi&s;tory, yet, drawing upon the infinite re&s;ources of his own mind for informa|tion, he adopted the very &s;ame means of furthering his views; and fore&s;eeing, that, with an immen&s;e army devoted to his intere&s;ts, few things would be unattainable, he applied him&s;elf diligently to model and form that of the KING of MYSORE to the great|e&s;t perfection in di&s;cipline, and to render it attached to his per&s;on, and &s;ub&s;ervient to his views, by a
<PB N="349" REF="031911_0344_0FEF4C4C0F6E8408">
&s;kilful mixture of &s;everity and relaxation, toil and re|ward, danger and applau&s;e, which none but a ma&s;ter-hand like his was capable of exactly compounding.</P>
<P>The death of his &s;overeign the KING of MYSORE at length afforded him the opportunity to which he had &s;o long, and with &s;o prophetic an eye, looked forward&mdash;and gave him ample room for &s;elf gratula|tion on the &s;core of his &s;agacity and prudence.</P>
<P>The heir in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne being then an infant, the politic HYDER, &s;etting a&s;ide all claims of the kindred of the young prince, took upon him&s;elf the guardian&s;hip&mdash;under the title of Regent a&s;&s;umed the &s;upreme authority&mdash;and, though too well aware of the inviolable attachment of the people to their lawful monarch to put him directly to death, u&s;urped the throne, and con&s;igned him to impri&s;onment in Seringapatam, the capital of the My&s;orean domini|ons.</P>
<P>Having thus, by his talents, acquired the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the throne, he gave a large range to the &s;ub|limity of his views, and &s;oon di&s;played the exhau&s;tle&s;s re&s;ources of his mind in the new office of Governor and Legi&s;lator&mdash;forming &s;uch va&s;t well-ordered mi|litary e&s;tabli&s;hments, and &s;uch judicious and &s;alutary civil in&s;titutions, as made him blaze forth at once the terror of his neighbours, and rendered him, in the &s;equel, the mo&s;t powerful and formidable poten|tate in the Hither Penin&s;ula. In carrying on tho&s;e, his deficiency in letters was &s;upplied by his vigilance and &s;agacity, &s;harpened by &s;u&s;picion: three &s;ecreta|ries executed all his orders in &s;eparate apartments: and if, on compari&s;on, they were found to differ, he who committed the error received &s;entence of death. His natural cruelty made him take the execution of their &s;entence upon him&s;elf not unfrequently: to &s;lice off a head with his own hand, or &s;ee it done by others, was a luxurious recreation to the &s;anguinary HYDER.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="031911_0345_0FEF4C4DA40E1658">The natural &s;agacity of this great man &s;ugge&s;ted, that in order to accompli&s;h the exten&s;ive objects which his active and ambitious temper held up to his imagination, the introduction of the mo&s;t per|fect military di&s;cipline was above all other things nece&s;&s;ary; and his judgment informed him that the European was the be&s;t. He therefore held out the mo&s;t tempting allurements to military adventurers, and particularly to tho&s;e, whether black or white, who had been trained in the &s;ervice of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company: he &s;ent emi&s;&s;aries, for the pur|po&s;e, to all parts of India, with in&s;tructions to offer great rewards; and carried this de&s;ign &s;o far, that whenever accident or war threw per&s;ons of that de&s;|cription into his hands, he never failed to detain them, and, if they refu&s;ed to enter into his &s;ervice, treat them with the mo&s;t unpardonable rigour and barbarity; and by the&s;e means brought his army to a &s;tate of perfection till then unknown to a black power. He did not &s;top there, but determined to e&s;tabli&s;h a navy&mdash;by large offers allured many &s;hip-carpenters and artizans from Bombay&mdash;made no in|con&s;iderable progre&s;s in con&s;tructing dock-yards, and had actually equipped &s;ome &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates, fitted to encounter European &s;eas. Indeed, he &s;eemed to have carried his views of con|que&s;t even to the Polar regions; for it is a fact, that he directed his people, in con&s;tructing tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, to fit them for encountering &s;eas of ice, or, as he called it, the thick water.</P>
<P>To a man of &s;uch ardent ambition and deep pene|tration, the va&s;t power which the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t In|dia company had acquired, and were daily acquir|ing, in the Ea&s;t, could not fail to be an object of jealou&s;y. He conceived a deadly and implacable animo&s;ity to the Briti&s;h Nation, which influenced his whole &s;ucceeding life, ended only with his death,
<PB N="351" REF="031911_0346_0FEF4C5218C9DEF8">
and was then tran&s;mitted to his &s;on TIPPOO SAHIB, with the exaction of a &s;olemn oath, ever to retain tho&s;e &s;entiments.</P>
<P>A coincidence of circum&s;tances, which has &s;eldom occurred in the fortunes of men, tended, at a lucky cri&s;is, to further the bold projects of HYDER; and neither fortune, though extremely propitious to him, nor his own unbounded talents and energetic &s;pirit, favoured the execution of them, more than the bungling politics, the ludicrous ambition, and the con&s;equent unju&s;tifiable proceedings, of one of our Pre&s;idencies in India&mdash;I mean Bombay. Fortunate|ly, the wi&s;dom and moderation of our Ea&s;t India councils at this day, vindicate the wounded charac|ter of the Briti&s;h nation, and ju&s;tify me in the re|marks I make.</P>
<P>An ambitious and profligate chief of the Marhatta Tribes&mdash;his name, RAGANAUT ROW&mdash;had been depo&s;ed by the wi&s;e men of his country, for having murdered his nephew, in order to u&s;urp the throne of Setterah. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to Bombay, and, by &s;pecious promi&s;es and other means, prevailed on that Pre&s;i|dency to afford him an a&s;ylum, and finally to take up arms in his defence again&s;t the united Marhatta States, who at the very time were able to rai&s;e an army of three hundred thou&s;and fighting men. Ho&s;|tilities were fir&s;t commenced by the Engli&s;h; and by them peace was fir&s;t propo&s;ed. The treaty of Poonah was made, by which it was provided that RAGANAUT ROW would quit Bombay; and by the Engli&s;h the provi&s;ions of that treaty were broken&mdash; for, in direct violation of it, RAGANAUT was kept at Bombay. This breach of the treaty led to another; for this crafty and unprincipled chief made u&s;e of it with &s;uch addre&s;s as to per&s;uade that Pre|&s;idency to attack the Marhattas again:&mdash;by magni|fying the power of his party among his countrymen,

he prevailed upon them once more to a&s;&s;ert his rights; and the Pre&s;idency of Calcutta, I am afraid&punc; were induced to join that of Bombay in the plan.</P>
<P>It happened unfortunately, that at this time the Pre&s;idency of Bombay was compo&s;ed of per&s;ons the mo&s;t unqualified, probably, that could be found in any community for offices of &s;uch importance. One, particularly, was allowed, by the almo&s;t unanimous con&s;ent of tho&s;e who knew his private or public character, to be ignorant, not only of the fir&s;t prin|ciples of government, but of the ordinary knowledge requi&s;ite for a gentleman; and for &s;ituations of mo|ment he was peculiarly di&s;qualified by a fondne&s;s for minutiae, to which he paid more attention than to matters of greater con&s;equence. A temper and in|tellect of this kind were rendered &s;till more incapa|ble of the enlarged views any Repre&s;entative of a great Nation in a di&s;tant colony &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s, by a mercantile education and habits, which narrowed even his circum&s;cribed mind, and left him not a &s;entiment, not an idea, that was not merely com|mercial. The admini&s;tration of &s;uch men was ex|actly what might have been expected; and, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;erting the dignity of Great Britain, or promot|ing the advantage of their employers&mdash;narrow policy, &s;elfi&s;h views, and efforts ari&s;ing from mi&s;taken no|tions of conque&s;t, made the whole ti&s;&s;ue of their conduct in India.</P>
<P>Blinded by the plau&s;ible in&s;inuations of RAGA|NAUT, and &s;timulated, as I have already ob&s;erved, by a lu&s;t for conque&s;t, which would have been un|ju&s;tifiable even in an hereditary de&s;pot, but which were peculiarly vicious and ridiculous in a body of merchants who were them&s;elves &s;ubjects, the Ea&s;t India company's &s;ervants again determined to &s;up|port, by force of arms, that mo&s;t atrocious mur|derer: and with the contemptibly inadequate force

<P>Had ROGANAUT advanced at the head of his own partizans only, the chiefs of the Marhatta Nation might po&s;&s;ibly have taken different &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and left between them a breach for his arms or intrigues to make an entrance fatal to the general cau&s;e of the country: but the a&s;&s;aults of a foreign army&mdash;an army of intere&s;ted peculating &s;trangers, as the company's troops then were&mdash;an army of avowed natural enemies, profe&s;&s;ing a dif|ferent religion, entertaining different political prin|ciples, and formed by nature of a different com|plexion&mdash;rou&s;ed and united them in one common cau&s;e, and compre&s;&s;ed di&s;cordant intere&s;ts, which had been for time immemorial at irreconcilable va|riance, into one compact body of re&s;i&s;tance, which, as it became more firm from the &s;trokes of ho&s;tility, could not, in the nature of things, be &s;ubdued; in the &s;ame manner as the unju&s;tifiable confederacy of kings again&s;t France lately united all the conflicting parties of that country&mdash;converted twenty-&s;even millions of people, male and female, into one com|pact armed force&mdash;rendered them not only invin|cible at home, but terrible abroad&mdash;and finally, has enabled them to be&s;tride, Colu&s;&s;us like, the uni|ver&s;e.</P>

<P>THE approach of the Briti&s;h troops with ROGANAUT cau&s;ed great alarm at Poonah; and the mini&s;ters there &s;ent to offer terms, which were con|temptuou&s;ly rejected. They then determined to &s;ave, by prowe&s;s, tho&s;e rights which they could not pre&s;erve by ju&s;tice or negociation&mdash;and took the field with &s;uch great force, that their menacing ene|mies found it expedient to con&s;ider of a retreat. The <HI>faithful</HI> ROGANAUT, finding his plans baffled, &s;ent privately to SCINDIAH, the Marhatta chief, pro|po&s;ing to him to attack the Engli&s;h, and promi&s;ing in that ca&s;e to join him with his part of the army: his per&s;idy, however, being di&s;covered, the Engli&s;h commanders began to retreat, carrying him along with them. They were, however, &s;urrounded, and reduced to make the mo&s;t abject conce&s;&s;ions&mdash;offer|ing a <HI>carte-blanche</HI> to SCINDIAH as the price of a retreat: but that augu&s;t chief nobly di&s;dained to take advantage of their &s;ituation, and contented him&s;elf with terms which ju&s;tice &s;hould have exacted from them, even if nece&s;&s;ity had not compelled their acceptance. The re&s;toration of Sal&s;ette, and of the other conque&s;ts made by the company's troops during the preceding ho&s;tilities, and the de|livery of ROGANAUT's per&s;on into the hands of the Marhattas, were among the provi&s;ions. ROGANAUT was delivered up: two ho&s;tages were taken for the
<PB N="355" REF="031911_0350_0FEF4C5D5AEF0CD0">
remaining part of the treaty; and the harra&s;&s;ed re|mains of the Engli&s;h army were permitted to return to Bombay.</P>
<P>ROGANAUT having found means to e&s;cape, reach|ed Surat; and the company's chiefs refu&s;ed to com|ply with the provi&s;ions of the treaty&punc; notwith&s;tand|ing which, the noble Marhatta di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ho&s;|tages, and prepared for a more manly revenge than that which could be wreaked on two defencele&s;s in|dividuals. General GODDART, who had been &s;ent with an army from Bengal, was commi&s;&s;ioned to negociate for a pacification: but SCINDIAH making the delivery of ROGANAUT into his hands an indi&s;|pen&s;able preliminary, the negociation was broken off, and both parties determined to refer the con|trover&s;y to the deci&s;ion of the &s;word.</P>
<P>Every thing &s;eemed to con&s;pire to cha&s;ti&s;e the ra&s;hne&s;s and folly of our Indian councils. The dif|ficulties in which our American conte&s;t had invol|ved the nation, were reported with exaggeration in India, and gave additional firmne&s;s to our enemies in that quarter. The re&s;tle&s;s and intriguing &s;pirit of the court of Ver&s;ailles found its way with Mon|&s;ieur ST. LUBIN to the &s;hores of Indo&s;tan, and &s;o powerfully worked upon the mind of HYDER, that he entered into a treaty with France again&s;t England, and brought the &s;trength of both into the mo&s;t for|midable combination that ever was made in that country, to root out the power of Great Britain from the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus, by the depraved politics of the councils of a petty &s;ettlement, were the important intere&s;ts of Great Britain in India, and the lives and properties of all its &s;ervants in that quarter, at once expo&s;ed to the fury of three formidable ho&s;tile powers&mdash;the Ma|rhat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as, HYDER and the French.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="031911_0351_0FEF4C5EF92549A8">I will not entangle my narrative with a detail of the various military operations which aro&s;e from this confederacy: they were in general di&s;a&s;trous to the Engli&s;h, who&s;e power there was pre&s;erved from utter annihilation by the energetic councils of Mr. HASTINGS, the unexampled courage of our troops, and the unparalleled abilities and gallantry of the ve|teran Sir EYRE COOTE. That part which applies to my pre&s;ent narrative, is the only part I think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to detail; but I wi&s;h you to inform your&s;elf of all of them fully, by an attentive peru&s;al of the different hi&s;tories of that war.</P>
<P>In order to relieve the Carnatic, which was &s;uf|fering under the ravages of a formidable victorious army, who had not only cut off a great part of our forces on that coa&s;t, but affronted our army even at the walls of Fort St. George, de&s;cents upon the coa&s;ts of Malabar were planned, in order to make a diver|&s;ion: and General MATHEWS, in January 1783, landed with a &s;mall army under his command, at a place called Rajamondroog&mdash;took Onore, and &s;everal forts: and being joined by other troops, which, un|der the command of Colonel HUMBERTSON, had done con&s;iderable &s;ervice to the &s;outhward, and were now commanded by Colonel MACLEOD, marched from Cundapore, with an army con&s;i&s;ting of twelve hundred Europeans and eight battalions of Sepoys, towards Hu&s;&s;aingurry Ghaut, a pa&s;s that leads over the&s;e immen&s;e mountains which divide the penin&s;ula, running north and &s;outh from Per&s;ia to Cape Como|rin.

within a &s;hort march of Hydernagur, the place where I was confined. Tho&s;e operations were undoubtedly much facilitated by the death of HYDER ALLI, which happened while I was in pri&s;on, and which drew the attention of TIPPOO SAHIB to affairs of more immediate importance than the defence of the Malabar forts.</P>
<P>I have thus digre&s;&s;ed from the &s;traight path of my narrative, in order to explain to you the occa&s;ion of the extraordinary revolution that &s;o &s;uddenly took place in the fort, which I &s;tated to you in my la&s;t letter but one&mdash;You will therefore look back to the conclu&s;ion of that letter, from whence I again take up my narrative.</P>
<P>I was utterly at a lo&s;s to conjecture what this &s;o &s;udden re&s;olution to relea&s;e me and my oppo&s;ite fel|low-pri&s;oner meant. I endeavoured to get &s;ome explanation of it from the per&s;ons about me; but all I could at the time collect was, that the Jemadar had directed me to be taken out of irons, and ordered me to appear before him. I walked out of the cita|del with two or three men who had got charge of me: it was a delightful afternoon; and my &s;en&s;ations on once more vi&s;iting the open air&mdash;at again viewing the va&s;t expan&s;e of the firmament above, and the profu&s;ion of beauties with which nature embelli&s;hed the earth beneath&mdash;were too bli&s;sful, too &s;ublime for de&s;cription. My heart beat with involuntary tran&s;|ports of gratitude to that Being from which all &s;prung; and I felt that man is, in his nature, even without the intervention of his rea&s;on, a being of devotion. For an hour of &s;uch delight as I then experienced, a year of impri&s;onment was, I thought, hardly too dear a price. Tho&s;e exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations in&s;en&s;ibly led my heart to the mo&s;t flattering pre&s;ages: the animal &s;pi|rit appeared to have, in corre&s;pondence with the
<PB N="358" REF="031911_0353_0FEF4C62367D6EB0">
body, &s;haken off a load of chains; and as I walked along, I &s;eemed to tread on air.</P>
<P>As we proceeded forward, we found, at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the fort, an open dooly, into which the guards forcibly crammed me; and I was carried off, &s;till attended by the &s;ame men. As we went along, they gave me to under&s;tand that HYAT SAHIB, the Jemadar, was at a place ten or a dozen miles di&s;tant from Bidanore. I thought it within my&s;elf a mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tance, and was at a lo&s;s to con|jecture for what purpo&s;e he required my pre&s;ence there. Perhaps, thought I, it is to deliver me per&s;onally into the hands of TIPPOO&mdash;perhaps to &s;end me to Se|ringapatam. Su&s;pence whetted my curio&s;ity; and impatience to know my fate, &s;et my mind afloat upon a wide &s;ea of conjecture. Still, however, my &s;en&s;es acknowledged a degree of plea&s;ure inde&s;cribable&mdash;I inhaled the fre&s;h air with greedine&s;s, and, as I &s;nuffed it in, &s;aid to my&s;elf, "Well, well&mdash;at the wor&s;t, this will enliven my &s;pirits, and lay up a new &s;tock of health and vigour, to enable me to endure with manhood whatever other &s;ufferings the barbarians, into who&s;e hands I have fallen, may have in &s;tore for me."</P>
<P>When we had got about a mile from the fort, we met a per&s;on attended by three others, all on hor&s;e|back. He was a man of con&s;iderable rank in that country, and I recollected to have &s;een him at the Jemadar's Durbar, where he had manife&s;ted a fa|vourable di&s;po&s;ition towards me, looking always graciou&s;ly, and nodding to me, which, con&s;idering my circum&s;tances and his, was not a little extraordi|nary. The moment he recognized me, he leaped from his hor&s;e, apparently in great agitation: then turning to the guards, ordered them to leave me im|mediately&mdash;&s;aying at the &s;ame time that he would be an&s;werable for the con&s;equences. They &s;eemed at
<PB N="359" REF="031911_0354_0FEF4C63C93D2490">
fir&s;t to he&s;itate whether they would obey him or not; but on his &s;haking at them his &s;word, which was all along drawn in his hand, and &s;meared with blood, and repeating his orders a &s;econd time in a firm and deci&s;ive tone of voice and manner, they all ran off.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were alone, he revealed to me, that he had all along known who I was&mdash;had mo&s;t hear|tily pitied my &s;ufferings, and privately entertained the mo&s;t anxious wi&s;hes to &s;erve me, but could not venture to interfere&mdash;the lea&s;t jealou&s;y, when once awakened, being there always followed up by &s;um|mary vengeance. He then mentioned his name, in|forming me that he was the &s;on of a Nabob near Vellore, who&s;e dominions had been wre&s;ted from him by force, and united to the Carnatic; that his family had received great favours from my father, in return for which he felt him&s;elf bound to do me every &s;ervice in his power; but that, having been, after the misfortunes which befel his family, taken into the &s;ervice of HYDER, and holding then a place of con&s;equence under him, he was di&s;qualified fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> demon&s;trating his gratitude and e&s;teem in the way he wi&s;hed: he added, he had ju&s;t come from the &s;um|mit of the Ghauts, where he left the Engli&s;h army po&s;ted, after their having beat the Circar troops, and carried all the &s;trong works which had been erected for the defence of the pa&s;&s;es, and were deemed from their &s;ituation impregnable; that the Jemadar, HY|AT SAHIB, had gone there to encourage the troops, and animate them to one grand effort of re&s;i&s;tance, and would remain there till the &s;ucceeding day&mdash; Here he &s;topped, and &s;eemed much agitated; but, recovering him&s;elf &s;oon, &s;aid, in a &s;olemn and alarm|ing manner, "This day I heard HYAT SAHIB give orders to bring you before him, in order that he might &s;atiate his revenge by your death!

<P>SUCH unprecedented genero&s;ity affected me &s;en&s;ibly. To run &s;uch a hazard as he mu&s;t have incurred, merely from a principle of gratitude for &s;ervices &s;o remote in both time and per&s;on, was more than we could hope to find even among Eng|li&s;hmen, who boa&s;t of their &s;uperior ju&s;tice and ge|nero&s;ity&mdash;but in a native of Indo&s;tan, where the tide of human feeling runs rather low, was a&s;toni&s;hing. As well as my limited knowledge of the language of the country enabled me, I endeavoured to make him a &s;uitable acknowledgment: in &s;uch a cau&s;e, dullne&s;s mu&s;t have become eloquent; and I lamented that my deficiency in the language prevented my giving vent to the extreme fullne&s;s of my heart. He &s;eem|ed, however, to be &s;atisfied with my meaning; and I was ju&s;t on the point of returning with him to Hy|dernagur, when we were &s;uddenly &s;tartled by the Je|madar's mu&s;ic, which was &s;oon afterwards &s;ucceeded by the appearance of his guards advancing towards us at &s;ome di&s;tance. He &s;eemed confounded and alarmed&mdash;lamented, in warm terms, his incapacity to &s;erve me&mdash;and, pointed to a path which wound through a wood that lay on either &s;ide of the road, directed me to &s;trike into it immediately, &s;aying,
<PB N="361" REF="031911_0356_0FEF4C6A567A8440">
that by following that route, I &s;hould certainly fall in with the Briti&s;h army. He then rode away, and I followed his advice, and proceeded for &s;ome time through the wood without interruption; for, though I did not implicitly believe the a&s;&s;ertion that HYAT SAHIB meant to have cut me off, I deemed it pru|dent to avail my&s;elf of the opportunity which offered to effect my e&s;cape, apprehending a wor&s;e fate than death, namely, being &s;ent pri&s;oner to Seringapatam.</P>
<P>Finding my&s;elf fairly extricated, I began to exa|mine my &s;ituation, and to reflect on the different conver&s;ations which had pa&s;&s;ed between HYAT SA|HIB and me, and on his conduct previous to my be|ing put in irons. I recollected the information I had from time to time received, touching the Jemadar's di&s;po&s;ition, HYDER's death, TIPPOO SAHIB's cha|racter and avowed hatred of HYAT, and the nature of the inhabitants. I moreover took into con&s;idera|tion, that my &s;trength was impaired, and my con|&s;titution undermined; and that my pro&s;pects in In|dia, in point of fame or emolument, could only be promoted by &s;ome extraordinary exertion, or &s;ome hazardous enterpri&s;e. The re&s;ult of the whole was a determination on my part to return back to the fort, and venture an attempt to per&s;uade the Jemadar to offer propo&s;als for an accommodation to General MATHEWS, and to make me the in&s;trument of his negociation.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this determination, I returned; and about &s;ix o'clock in the evening re-entered the fort, and proceeded to the palace of the Jemadar, where, de&s;iring an audience, I was admitted. At the very fir&s;t &s;ight of him, I could perceive in his appearance all the mortification of falling power. He received me with a gloomy countenance, in which there was more of thoughtful &s;adne&s;s than of vindictive fury. After a minute's &s;ilence, however,
<PB N="362" REF="031911_0357_0FEF4C6BE75CF720">
he &s;aid to me, "Well, Sir! you have heard, I &s;up|po&s;e, that the Engli&s;h army are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ghauts, and doubtle&s;s know that the cu&s;toms of this country authori&s;e my proceeding again&s;t you with the utmo&s;t rigor." Here he pau&s;ed for a few mo|ments&mdash;then proceeded thus: "Neverthele&s;s, in con&s;ideration of your family&mdash;in con&s;ideration of the regard I have for a long time conceived for you, from ob&s;erving your conduct, and &s;trict adherence to truth in an&s;wering all my que&s;tions, and &s;till more on ac|count of the &s;ufferings which you have &s;u&s;tained with fortitude, I will allow you to e&s;cape: ha&s;te you, then, away&mdash;fly from this fort directly&mdash;begone!" Then waving his hand as a &s;ignal for me to depart, averted his face from me, and looked another way.</P>
<P>I thought that this was a very favourable oppor|tunity for my intended purpo&s;e, and entreated him to hear me while I &s;aid a few words of perhaps more moment to him than to my&s;elf. He again turned towards me; and, nodding a&s;cent, while his eye be&s;poke impatient curio&s;ity, I proceeded&mdash;And, fir&s;t, I expre&s;&s;ed, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms I was able, the high &s;en&s;e I entertained of the favourable reception I met with when I fir&s;t came to the fort; a&s;&s;uring him, that I &s;hould never forget the kindne&s;s he &s;hewed me on that occa&s;ion, and that in my con&s;cience I imputed all the &s;ufferings I had undergone wholly to orders which he had been obliged to execute, and not to any want of humanity in him&s;elf. Here I perceived the clouds which had over&s;pread his coun|tenance begin gradually to di&s;per&s;e, and with the greater confidence proceeded to &s;ay, that if he would conde&s;cend to give me a patient hearing, and not take my boldne&s;s ami&s;s, I would venture to intrude upon him with my advice. At this he &s;tared at me with a look of &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;pau&s;ed&mdash;then &s;aid, that he authori&s;ed me to &s;peak whatever I plea&s;ed&mdash;conti|nuing,
<PB N="363" REF="031911_0358_0FEF4C6EF4EBDDE8">
in a tone of gentle melancholy, "But of what u&s;e can your advice be to me now?"</P>
<P>Having thus obtained his permi&s;&s;ion, I began by complimenting him on his great talents and temper in governing&mdash;on his fidelity zeal and attachment to HYDER&mdash;and on the mild and benificent u&s;e which he was acknowledged to have made of the unbounded power ve&s;ted in him by that great Prince, which was the more extraordinary, con&s;idering how many ex|amples he had to ju&s;tify him in a contrary practice. I reminded him, however, that circum&s;tances were at pre&s;ent widely different from what they were&mdash;that he had now got a very different &s;overeign to &s;erve&mdash;that he had no longer the tender father (for &s;o HYDER might have been con&s;idered to him), but TIPPOO SULTAN, now the ma&s;ter, once the rival, who&s;e mea&s;ures he had always oppo&s;ed, again&s;t whom he had once laid a mo&s;t &s;erious charge, and who, con|&s;idering the firmne&s;s of his nature, could not be rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to have forgiven him; and I hinted, that whatever external appearance of regard TIPPOO might from the political nece&s;&s;ity of the moment a&s;|&s;ume, his temper, and the &s;pirit of A&s;iatic policy, were too well known to have a doubt remaining, that &s;o far from continuing him (HYAT) in the &s;ame pow|er and authority which he enjoyed during the life of his father HYDER, he would, on the contrary, pro|ceed again&s;t him with rigor and cruelty.</P>
<P>Here I perceived the Jemadar involuntary nod|ding his head in a manner which, though not intend|ed for my ob&s;ervation, denoted internal a&s;&s;ent; and was convinced that I had exactly fallen in with the current of his own thoughts. No wonder, indeed, they &s;hould be his &s;entiments; for they had long been the &s;entiments of all per&s;ons who had known the circum&s;tances of the Nabob's family.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="031911_0359_0FEF4C7389573C40">Having, therefore, gone as far on that poi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as I conceived to be nece&s;&s;ary to awaken the mind of HYAT to the precariou&s;ne&s;s, or rather danger of his &s;ituation with TIPPOO, I painted to him, in the &s;tronge&s;t colours I was ma&s;ter of, the humanity, the fidelity, the bravery and genero&s;ity of the Engli&s;h, which, I &s;aid, were &s;o univer&s;ally acknowledged, that even their wor&s;t enemies bore te&s;timony to them: and I a&s;&s;ured him, that if, in&s;tead of making an un|availing oppo&s;ition to them, he would throw him&s;elf with confidence upon their protection, and become their friend, he would not only be continued in his &s;tation, power and authority, and &s;upported as here|tofore, but be made a much greater man, with &s;till greater &s;ecurity, than ever he had been before.</P>
<P>This was the general &s;cope of my argument with him; but there were many more which &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves at the time, though I cannot now remem|ber them. I enforced them with all the power I had: they were &s;upported by the acknowledged character for genero&s;ity of the Engli&s;h, and &s;till more by HYAT's apprehen&s;ions of TIPPOO; and they had their effect. That very night he authori&s;ed me to go to the Briti&s;h General; and, though he would not commit him&s;elf by &s;ending propo&s;als in writing, he con&s;ented to receive them from the Ge|neral, and promi&s;ed to wait for my return till day|light the next morning&mdash;adding, that if I did not appear by that time, he would go off with his family and trea&s;ure to &s;ome other place, and &s;et the town, powder-magazine and &s;tore-hou&s;es on fire, leaving a per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed character to defend the citadel or inner fort, which was &s;trong, with a deep ditch, and mounted with many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of cannon, and &s;end immedia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e intelligence to an army o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e and ten thou&s;and infantry, who were at that

time on their road from Seringapatam, to ha&s;ten their progre&s;s, and make them advance with all po&s;|&s;ible rapidity; and he further ob&s;erved, that as TIP|POO him&s;elf would come to the immediate protection of his country, and, if once come while the Engli&s;h army remained in the open field, would give them cau&s;e to repent their temerity, there was no time to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Accompanied by a per&s;on who had officiated as in|terpreter between the Jemadar and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and who&s;e good offices and influence with HYAT, which was very great, I had been previou&s;ly lucky enough to &s;ecure, I &s;et off at ten o'clock at night, on hor&s;eback, to the Briti&s;h army. My companion was in high &s;pirits when we fir&s;t &s;et out from the fort; but as we proceeded, he expre&s;&s;ed great apprehen&s;ion of being &s;hot in approaching the camp, and earne&s;ty entreated me to &s;leep at a choreltry, which lay in our way, till morning. His terror mu&s;t have been great indeed, to induce him to make &s;uch a propo&s;al, as he knew very well that we had pledged our&s;elves to be back before dawn next day. I rallied him upon his fears, and endeavoured to per&s;uade him there was not the &s;malle&s;t danger, as I knew how to an&s;wer the out|po&s;ts, when they &s;hould challenge us, in &s;uch a man|ner as to prevent their firing. As we advanced to the camp, however, his trepidation increa&s;ed; and when we approached the &s;entries, I was obliged to drag him along by force. Then his fears had very nearly produced the danger he dreaded, (the almo&s;t invariable effect of cowardice); for the &s;entry next to us, hearing the ru&s;tling noi&s;e, let off his piece, and was retreating when I had the good fortune to make him hear me. My c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpanion, alarmed at the noi&s;e of the mu&s;quet, fell down in a paroxy&s;m of terror, from which it was &s;ome time before he was completely recovered.

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS no le&s;s plea&s;ed than &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that the commander of this gallant and &s;ucce&s;s|ful little army was General MATHEWS&mdash;an old friend of my father's, and a per&s;on with whom I had &s;erved in the cavalry &s;oon after I entered the &s;ervice. When I arrived he was fa&s;t a&s;leep upon the bare ground in a choreltry. His duba&s;h, who&s;e name was SNAKE, recollected me immediately, and was almo&s;t as much frightened at my appearance at fir&s;t, as my interpre|ter companion was at the &s;hot of the &s;entry; for it was full five months &s;ince my hair and beard were both &s;haved at the &s;ame time, during which period a comb had never touched my head: I had no hat&mdash; no &s;tockings&mdash;was clad in a pair of very ragged breeches, a &s;hirt which was &s;o full of holes that it re&s;embled rather a net than a web of cloth, and a wai&s;tcoat which had been made for a man twice my &s;ize&mdash;while my feet were defended from the &s;tones only by a pair of Indian &s;lippers. SNAKE as &s;oon as he was able to conquer his terror, and &s;top the loquacious effu&s;ions of a&s;toni&s;hment, brought me to the General, whom I found fa&s;t a&s;leep. We awoke him with great difficulty, and, on his di&s;covering
<PB N="367" REF="031911_0362_0FEF4C79DBE90118">
me, expre&s;&s;ed great plea&s;ure and &s;urpri&s;e at &s;o unex|pected a meeting; for, though he had heard of my impri&s;onment at Bidanore, he did not expect to have had the plea&s;ure of my company &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated to the General the nature and ob|ject of my mi&s;&s;ion, and related to him what had happened in the fort, he in&s;tantly &s;aw the great ad|vantages that mu&s;t accrue from &s;uch an arrangement &mdash;entered into a full but &s;hort di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s&mdash;&s;ettled with me the plan to be pur&s;ued in either ca&s;e of HYAT SAHIB's acceding to or di&s;&s;enting from the terms he propo&s;ed to offer; and in le&s;s than an hour after my arrival I was di&s;patched back to the fort in the General's palanquin, with a cowl from him, &s;ignifying that the Jemadar HYAT SAHIB's power and influence &s;hould not be le&s;&s;ened, if he &s;hould quietly &s;urrender up the fort. Before my de|parture, the General expre&s;&s;ed, in the warme&s;t terms, his approbation of my conduct; and added that con|&s;idering the importance of the fort, the exten&s;ive influence of HYAT SAHIB, and the advantages that might be derived from his experience and abilities, coupled with the enfeebled &s;tate of his army, the benefits of &s;uch a negociation &s;carcely admitted of calculation.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the very flattering circum&s;tances with which my pre&s;ent pur&s;uit was attended, I could not help, as I returned to Hydernagur, finding &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, ari&s;ing from the immediate nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and from my knowledge of the faith|le&s;s di&s;po&s;ition of A&s;iatics, and the little difficulty they find in violating any moral principle, if it hap|pens to cla&s;h with their intere&s;t, or if a breach of it promi&s;es any advantage. I con&s;idered that it was by no means impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;ome re&s;olution adver&s;e to my project might have been adopted in my ab|&s;ence, and that the Jemadar's policy might lead him
<PB N="368" REF="031911_0363_0FEF4C7B6C166C38">
to make my de&s;truction a &s;ort of propitiation for his former offences, and to &s;end me and the cowl to|gether to TIPPOO, to be &s;acrificed to his re&s;entment. The&s;e thoughts, I own, made a very deep impre&s;|&s;ion on my mind&mdash;but were again effaced by the re|flection, that a laudable mea&s;ure, once begun, ought to be per&s;evered in, and that the accompli&s;hing a plan of &s;uch importance and incalculable public utility, might operate &s;till further by example, and produce con&s;equences of which it was impo&s;&s;ible at the pre&s;ent to form a conception. Tho&s;e, and a variety of &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions, entirely overcame the &s;cruples and fears of the danger; and I once more entered the fort of Hydernagur. At this time the Briti&s;h troops, were by detaching a part with Co|lonel MACLEOD, to get round the fort, and attack it in the rear, and, by death and &s;ickne&s;s, reduced to le&s;s than four hundred Europeans and &s;even hun|dred Sepoys, without ordnance.</P>
<P>When I delivered the cowl to the Jemadar, he read it, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed, but talked of four or five days to con&s;ider of an an&s;wer, and &s;eemed to be wavering in his mind, and labouring under the alternate impul&s;es of oppo&s;ite motives and contra|dictory pa&s;&s;ions. I &s;aw that it was a cri&s;is of more importance than any other of my life&mdash;a cri&s;is in which delay, irre&s;olution, or yielding to the pro|tractive expedients of HYAT, might be fatal. To prevent, therefore, the effects of either treachery or repentance, I took advantage of the general con|fu&s;ion and trepidation which prevailed in the fort&mdash; collected the Arcot Sepoys, who, to the number of four hundred, were pri&s;oners at large&mdash;po&s;ted them at the gates, powder-magazines, and other critical &s;ituations; and, having taken the&s;e and other pre|cautions, went out to the General, who, according to the plan concerted between us, had pu&s;hed on
<PB N="369" REF="031911_0364_0FEF4C7CF7042EC8">
with the advanced guard; and, conducting him into the fort with hardly an attendant, brought him &s;traight to the Jemadar's pre&s;ence while he, yet re|mained in a &s;tate of indeci&s;ion and terror. General MATHEWS, in his fir&s;t interview with the Jema|dar, did every thing to re-a&s;&s;ure him, and confirmed with the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations the terms of the cowl; in con&s;equence of which the latter acceded to the propo&s;itions contained in it, and the Briti&s;h co|lours for the fir&s;t time waved upon the walls of the chief fort of the country of Bidanore.</P>
<P>Having thus contributed to put this important gar|ri&s;on, with all its trea&s;ures, which certainly were immen&s;e, into the hands of the Company, without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle man, or even the &s;triking of a &s;in|gle blow, my exultation was inconceivable; and, much though I wanted money, I can with truth aver, that avarice had not even for an in&s;tant the lea&s;t &s;hare in my &s;en&s;ations. 'Tis true, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my &s;ervices a&s;&s;ured me of a reward; but how that reward was to accrue to me, never once was the &s;ub|ject of my contemplation&mdash;much le&s;s did I think of availing my&s;elf of the in&s;tant occa&s;ion to obtain it. How far my delicacy on the occa&s;ion may be cen|&s;ured or approved, I cannot tell; but if I got nothing by it, I have at lea&s;t the con&s;olation to reflect that I e&s;caped calumny, which was with a mo&s;t unju&s;tifia|ble and un&s;paring hand lavi&s;hed on others. The General, it is true, promi&s;ed that I &s;hould remain with him till he made &s;ome arrangements; and HYAT SAHIB offered, on his part, to make me, through the General, a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent. The General, however, &s;uddenly became di&s;&s;atisfied with me; and I neither got HYAT SAHIB's pre&s;ent, nor ever r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eived even a rupee of the va&s;t &s;poil found there.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="031911_0365_0FEF4C819ACC9498">Here I think it a duty incumbent on me to &s;ay &s;omething of General MATHEWS, and, while I de|plore the unfortunate turn in his temper, which in|jured me, and tarni&s;hed in &s;ome mea&s;ure his good qualities, to re&s;cue him from that unmerited oblo|quy which the ignorant, the intere&s;ted and the en|vious have thrown upon his fame. Light lie the a&s;hes of the dead; and hallowed be the turf that pil|lows the head of a &s;oldier! General MATHEWS was indeed a &s;oldier&mdash;was calumniated too; and although he did not u&s;e me as I had rea&s;on to hope he would, I will, as far as I can, re&s;cue his fame from gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>An extravagant love of fame was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of General MATHEWS: it was the great end of all his pur&s;uits; and while, in his military profe&s;&s;ion, he walked with a firm pace towards it, he lo&s;t his time, di&s;torted his progre&s;s, and pal&s;ied his own ef|forts, by a jealous vigilance and envious oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e whom he found taking the &s;ame road, whe|ther they walked be&s;ide him, or panted in feeble ef|fort behind. This was his fault; it was doubtle&s;s a great alloy to his good qualities: but it has been puni&s;hed with rigour di&s;proportionate to the offence. Tho&s;e who per&s;onally felt his jealou&s;y, took advan|tage of his melancholy end to traduce him, and mag|nify every mole-hill of error into a mountain of crime. It is unmanly in any one&mdash;indeed it is&mdash;to traduce the &s;oldier who has fallen in the &s;ervice of his country; but it is here&s;y in a &s;oldier to do &s;o. No &s;ooner did the buzz of calumny get abroad, than thou&s;ands of hornets, who had neither intere&s;t nor concern in the affair, joined in it. The malignant, who wi&s;hed to &s;ting merely to get rid of &s;o much of their venom&mdash;and the vain, who wi&s;hed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cquire a reputation for knowledge of A&s;iatic affa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s at the expence of truth&mdash;united together, and rai&s;ed a hum

which reached Europe, where the hornets (I mean authors), under the le&s;s unju&s;tifiable impul&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity; took it up, and buzzed through the medium of <HI>quartos</HI> and <HI>octavos</HI> &s;o loud, that public opinion was poi&s;oned; and the gallant &s;oldier who, for the ad|vantage of England, &s;tood the harde&s;t tugs of war, and at la&s;t drank the poi&s;oned cup from the tyrant hands of her enemy, was generally under&s;tood to be a peculator, and to have clande&s;tinely and di&s;hone&s;tly obtained three hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>On this a&s;&s;ertion I put my direct negative. It may be &s;aid, however, that this is only a&s;&s;ertion again&s;t a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;True! Sorry &s;hould I be to re&s;t it there: my a&s;&s;ertions are grounded on &s;uch proofs as are not to be &s;haken&mdash;proofs on record in the office of the Pre&s;idency of Bombay.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Hydernagur was taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, HYAT SAHIB immediately i&s;&s;ued orders to the forts of Mangalore, Deokull, Ananpore, and &s;ome others in that country, to &s;urrender to the Briti&s;h arms. Some obeyed the mandate; but tho&s;e three re&s;i&s;ted, and were reduced by General MATHEWS. Rendered incautious by &s;ucce&s;s, our army became le&s;s vigilant, and TIPPOO retook Hydernagur; and, in direct breach of the capitulation, made the garri&s;on pri&s;on|ers, treated them with a degree of inhumanity which chills the blood even to think of, and forced General MATHEWS to take poi&s;on in pri&s;on!</P>
<P>Mean-time HYAT SAHIB, with whom the Ge|neral had got into di&s;putes, arrived at Bombay, and laid a charge again&s;t him, which he, being in the hands of TIPPOO, could not controvert, or even know. And what was the charge? The whole ex|tent of it was his (MATHEWS's) having got two lacks of rupees, and a pearl necklace, as a pre&s;ent&mdash;a &s;um, con&s;idering the country and circum&s;tances, not at all extraordinary, But which is completely vindicated

by the General's letter to the Court of Directors, dated at Mangalore, the 15th of March, 1783; in which he &s;tates the pre&s;ent, and reque&s;ts permi&s;&s;ion to accept it. This, as I &s;aid before, is on record, and was tran&s;lated by Mr. SYBBALD, who was then Per&s;ian interpreter at Bombay. The letter I allude to, you will &s;ee in the APPENDIX.

<HEAD>LETTER LIX.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in my la&s;t letter, &s;aid as much as I thought ju&s;tice demanded in defence of General MATHEWS, again&s;t the charge of peculation, I am now to &s;peak of him as his conduct touched me. He was, as I have already mentioned, an old friend of my father's, and an intimate of my own: I had rea|&s;on, therefore, to expect from him, according to the u&s;ual di&s;po&s;itions and manners of men, if not partiality, at lea&s;t friend&s;hip; and in &s;uch a ca&s;e as I have related, where my &s;ervices gave me a claim to notice, it was not unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that he would have been forward to promote my intere&s;t, by &s;tating my &s;ervices in &s;uch a manner as to call atten|tion to them. He had, however, &s;ome di&s;agreea|ble di&s;cu&s;&s;ions with his officers; and &s;eeing I was on a footing with Colonel HUMBERTSON, and &s;till more with Major CAMPBELL (he who &s;o ably and gal|lantly
<PB N="373" REF="031911_0368_0FEF4C8AD926E378">
defended Mangalore again&s;t TIPPOO's whole army and &s;ix hundred French), and finding me ex|tremely zealous and importunate to have his ar|rangement with HYAT SAHIB adhered to, he be|came di&s;plea&s;ed, and, though he him&s;elf had deter|mined that I &s;hould remain with him, changed his mind, and ordered me away at an hour's notice&mdash; many days &s;ooner than he had originally intended to &s;end off any di&s;patches. He moreover occa&s;ioned my lo&s;ing a &s;um of money, and on the whole paid le&s;s attention to my intere&s;t than the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e demanded.</P>
<P>In the evening of the day on which he determined on my departure, I &s;et off with his di&s;patches to the governments of Madra&s;s and Bengal, and reached the mo&s;t di&s;tant of our po&s;ts that night. From thence I had thirty miles to Cundapore, a &s;ea-port town upon the Malabar coa&s;t, taken by us from the ene|my. During this journey, which was through the country of TIPPOO SAHIB, I had only &s;ix Sepoys to conduct me: yet, &s;uch was the univer&s;al panic that had &s;eized all cla&s;&s;es and di&s;tinctions of people at the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms in that quarter, I met only a few &s;cattered Sepoys, who were &s;o badly wounded I pre&s;ume they were unable to travel&mdash;the villages throughout being completely abandoned by all their inhabitants.</P>
<P>The &s;udden change of diet, which phy&s;icians tell us, and I experienced, is dangerous, from bad to good, as well as the rever&s;e, con&s;piring with the mortification I felt at &s;eeing things going on &s;o very contrary to what I wi&s;hed, and what I had rea&s;on to expect, had a mo&s;t &s;udden and alarming effect upon my con&s;titution; and I was &s;eized on the road with the mo&s;t excrutiating, internal pains, which were &s;ucceeded by a violent vomiting of blood. At length, with great difficulty, I reached Cundapore,
<PB N="374" REF="031911_0369_0FEF4C8DD223C4B0">
where the commanding officer, and all about him, did every thing in their power to afford me a&s;&s;i&s;tance and comfort under my mi&s;eries, which increa&s;ed every hour rapidly. I felt as if my in&s;ide was utterly de|cayed, and all its functions lo&s;t in debility: at the &s;ame time my head &s;eemed deranged&mdash;I could &s;carce|ly comprehend the meaning of what was &s;aid; lift|ing up my head was attended with agonizing pain; and if I had any power of thought, it was to con|&s;ider my&s;elf as approaching fa&s;t to di&s;&s;olution. I had the &s;en&s;e, however, to &s;end to General MA|THEWS, to acquaint him with my indi&s;po&s;ition, and utter inability to proceed with his di&s;patches. To this I received the following letter:

<P>The receipt of this letter induced me, bad as I was, to make one other exertion; and I re&s;olved, though I &s;hould die on the way, not to leave any thing which, even by malicious con&s;truction, could
<PB N="375" REF="031911_0370_0FEF4C90ECDEE870">
be made a &s;et-off again&s;t my claims: I therefore hired an open boat to carry me along the coa&s;t to Anjengo, and &s;et out with every pro&s;pect of having the virulence of my di&s;order increa&s;ed, by being ex|po&s;ed in an uncovered ve&s;&s;el to the damp of the night air, and the raging heat of the &s;un in the day, and of being arre&s;ted by the hand of death in my way. By the time I had got down the coa&s;t as far as Mangalore, my complaints increa&s;ed to an alarm|ing heighth; and I became &s;peechle&s;s, and unable to &s;tand. Fortunately there happened to be a Com|pany's ve&s;&s;el then lying at anchor off that place, the captain of which had the goodne&s;s to invite me to remain on board with him, &s;trenuou&s;ly advi&s;ing that I &s;hould give up the thoughts of proceeding immediately on my voyage to Anjengo, which I could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;urvive, and to forward my di&s;|patches by another hand. The &s;urgeon of the &s;hip joining the captain in opinion that I could not &s;ur|vive if I attempted it, and my own judgment coin|ciding with their's, I at length con&s;ented, and re|mained there.</P>
<P>Tranquillity, kind treatment, and good medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, produced, in the &s;pace of two or three weeks, &s;o material a change in my health, I was in a condition to avail my&s;elf, at the expiration of that time, of a &s;hip bound to Anjengo, and which of|fering the additional inducement of touching at Tel|licherry, determined me to take my pa&s;&s;age in her. When I arrived at Tellicherry, and during my &s;tay there, the great attention &s;hewn me by Mr. FREE|MAN, the chief of that place, and the comforts of his hou&s;e, re&s;tored me to a great &s;hare of health and &s;pirits&mdash;And here a very &s;ingular circum&s;tance oc|curred.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="031911_0371_0FEF4C94296F5878">One day a ve&s;&s;el arrived; and perceiving a boat coming on &s;hore from her, Mr. FREEMAN and I walked down to the beach, to make the u&s;ual in|quiries&mdash;&s;uch as, where &s;he came from? what news &s;he brought? <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> As &s;oon as the boat touched the &s;hore, a gentleman leaped out of it, who&s;e per|&s;on &s;eemed familiar to me: upon his nearer approach, I di&s;covered that it was Mr. BRODEY, a gentleman who had been kind enough to take upon him the office of my attorney, upon my leaving India &s;ome years before&mdash;not my <HI>attorney</HI> in the ordinary acceptation of that word, but a liberal and di&s;inter|e&s;ted friend, who obligingly undertook the manage|ment of my affairs in my ab&s;ence, without the &s;mal|le&s;t hope of advantage, or rather under circum&s;tan|ces which &s;erved as preludes to further obligations. I was certainly plea&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him; but his a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee me amounted almo&s;t to a di&s;|tru&s;t of his eye-&s;ight: he had received &s;uch indubi|table proofs of my death, that my &s;udden appear|ance on his landing, at the fir&s;t ru&s;h of thought, im|pre&s;&s;ed him with the notion of a <HI>deceptio vi&s;us.</HI> My identity, however, was too po&s;itive for re&s;i&s;tance; and his wonder melted down into cordial &s;atisfac|tion, and congratulations on my &s;afety. He then took out a pocket account-book, in which, for &s;ecurity again&s;t accidents, he kept accounts-current, written in a brief manner&mdash;and &s;hewed me mine, &s;ettled almo&s;t to the very day, upon which was tran&s;|cribed a copy of a letter he had received, and which he thought was a te&s;timony of my death. So, cut|ting out the account, and pre&s;enting it to me, he expre&s;&s;ed, in the mo&s;t cordial and hand&s;ome manner, his joy that it was into my own hands he had at la&s;t had an opportunity to deliver it. This gentleman is now in this Kingdom, and too well known for me
<PB N="377" REF="031911_0372_0FEF4C95B9045810">
to de&s;cribe him. Suffice it to &s;ay, that in England, as well as in India, he has always enjoyed the e&s;teem and re&s;pect of all his acquaintances, to as great an ex|tent as any other per&s;on I know.</P>
<P>I again embarked to proceed on my voyage, and had hardly got on board when a &s;hip dropped anchor along &s;ide of us, in which captain CAMPBELL of Comby, a very near connection of mine, was pa&s;|&s;enger. On hailing one another, he heard that I was on board, and immediately was with me. Tho&s;e who &s;incerely love each other, and who&s;e hearts confe&s;s the fond ties of con&s;anguinity, can alone conceive what our mutual plea&s;ure was at meeting &s;o unexpectedly in &s;o remote a corner of the world. He was then on his way to join the army. This amiable young man, now repo&s;es in the bed of honour at Mangalore! He fell, after having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the very gallant defence made by that place again&s;t the whole force of TIPPOO. With regret we parted: and in due time I arrived at Anjengo without any accident befalling me, which was rather extraordinary.</P>
<P>Leaving Anjengo, I &s;et out for Madras, de&s;igning to go all the way by land&mdash;a journey of near eight hundred miles. I accordingly &s;truck through the Kingdom of Travancore, who&s;e &s;overeign is in al|liance with the Engli&s;h; and had not long entered the territories of the Nabob of Arcot, before Major MACNEAL, an old friend of mine, and commandant of a fort in that di&s;trict, met me preceded by a troop of dancing girls, who encircled my palanquin, dan|cing around me until I entered the Major's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It would be difficult to give you an adequate notion of tho&s;e dancing girls. Trained up from their in|fancy to the practice of the mo&s;t graceful motions, the mo&s;t artful di&s;play of per&s;onal &s;ymmetry, and the mo&s;t wanton allurements, they dance in &s;uch a &s;tyle,
<PB N="378" REF="031911_0373_0FEF4C974BCFD590">
and twine their limbs and bodies into &s;uch po&s;tures, as bewitch the &s;en&s;es, and extort applau&s;e and admi|ration where in &s;trictne&s;s di&s;approbation is due: nor is their agility inferior to the grace of their move|ments&mdash;though they do not exert it in the &s;ame &s;kipping way that our &s;tage dancers do, but make it &s;ub&s;ervient to the elegance, and, I may &s;ay, gran|deur, of their air. They are generally found in troops of &s;ix or eight, attended by mu&s;icians, who&s;e a&s;pect and dre&s;s are as uncouth and &s;qualid, as the &s;ounds they produce under the name of mu&s;ic, are inelegant, har&s;h and di&s;&s;onant. To this mu&s;ic, from which mea&s;ure as much as harmony is excluded, they dance, mo&s;t wonderfully adapting their &s;tep to the perpetual change of the time, accompanying it with amorous &s;ongs, while the corre&s;pondent action of their body and limbs, the wanton palpitation and heaving of their exqui&s;itely formed bo&s;oms, and the amorous, or rather la&s;civious expre&s;&s;ion of their countenance, excite in the &s;pectators emotions not very favourable to cha&s;tity. Thus they continue to act, till, by the warmth of exerci&s;e and immagi|nation, they become &s;eemingly frantic with ec&s;tacy, and, &s;inking down motionle&s;s with fatigue, throw them&s;elves into the mo&s;t alluring attitudes that in|genious vice and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s can po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e.</P>
<P>That &s;uch incitements to vice &s;hould make a part of the &s;y&s;tem of any &s;ociety, is to be lamented: yet, at all ceremonies and great occa&s;ions, whether of religious wor&s;hip or dome&s;tic enjoyment, they make a part of the entertainment; and the altar of their gods, and the purity of the marriage rites, are alike polluted by the introduction of the dancing girls. The impurity of this cu&s;tom, however, vani&s;hes in India, when compared with the hideous practice of introducing dancing <HI>boys.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="031911_0374_0FEF4C9A55158988">The Major, after having entertained me in the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable manner, accompanied me to Palam|cotah, to the hou&s;e of Doctor DOTT, who lived in a generous and ho&s;pitable &s;tyle. I had once had an opportunity of evincing my good di&s;po&s;ition to this gentleman, when he was mo&s;t critically &s;ituated; and the reception he gave me demon&s;trated, that he then retained a lively &s;en&s;e of my conduct to him.</P>
<P>Leaving Palamcotah, I continued my route through Madura. This country is rendered re|markable by the revolt of the famous ISIF CAWN, who made a bold and well-conducted attempt to erect him&s;elf into the &s;overeignty of that province, independent of the Nabob of the Carnatic, in who&s;e &s;ervice he was: and as the affair occurs to my thoughts, I will, for your information, notwith|&s;tanding its being unconnected with my &s;tory, digre&s;s into an account of it. As &s;oon as the revolt of ISIF CAWN was known, General MONSON, an officer of great military &s;kill and per&s;onal merit, went again&s;t him at the head of the King's and company's troops, and inve&s;ted the fort of Madura, in which that re|bellious chief was po&s;ted. The general made a practicable breach, and, in &s;torming, was beat back with great &s;laughter by ISIF; and the &s;etting in of the mon&s;oons immediately after, retarded the further operations of our army again&s;t the place; and in the interim, peace having been concluded between the courts of St. James's and Ver&s;ailles, the King's troops were withdrawn.</P>
<P>On the recal of the King's troops, an army of company's troops was formed, to proceed again&s;t Madura, in order to reduce this gallant turbulent rebel to &s;ubjection; and the renowned general LAW|RENCE being rendered incapable of actual &s;ervice, and obliged to remain at the pre&s;idency by extreme
<PB N="380" REF="031911_0375_0FEF4C9F33EB59F0">
age and infirmity, the chief command devolved upon my father by &s;eniority: he headed the expe|dition; and, after overcoming innumerable difficul|ties thrown in his way by the inventive genius and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of ISIF CAWN, again made a breach, which was deemed practicable by the chief engineer, now Sir JOHN CALL. An a&s;&s;ault was made with no better &s;ucce&s;s than the former; for our army was again repul&s;ed with incredible &s;laughter: more than two thirds, I believe, of our European officers, were among the killed or wound|ed; and the death of Major PRESTON, &s;econd in command, a man endeared to the army by the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of every advantage of per&s;on, heart and talents&mdash;an active, intrepid and able officer&mdash;ag|gravated the calamities of the day.</P>
<P>If, impelled by my feelings, or tempted by re|membrance of the pa&s;t, I &s;ometimes digre&s;s from the direct path of my narrative, my FREDERICK will accompany me, not only with patience, but I dare &s;ay with plea&s;ure: I cannot refrain, therefore, from mentioning a memorable occurrence during that &s;iege, not only as it is &s;omewhat extraordinary in it&s;elf, but as it relates to a very near and dear connection. Colonel DONALD CAMPBELL, who then commanded the cavalry, received no le&s;s than fourteen &s;word-wounds and a mu&s;quet-ball in his body&mdash;yet continued doing his duty with &s;uch cool intrepidity, that brave &s;oldiers who were witne&s;&s;es to it, expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment: upon being reque&s;ted to quit the field, he replied, that as his family were provided for, he had nothing to fear; and as it was very unlikely his life could be &s;aved, he would not deprive his country of any ad|vantage that might be derived from his exertions for the &s;hort re&s;idue of it, but continue to the la&s;t moment at his duty. With all this firmne&s;s and
<PB N="381" REF="031911_0376_0FEF4CA0C7263EF8">
magnanimity, he was gentle, good-humoured, mo|de&s;t and una&s;&s;uming; and was admired for his great per&s;onal beauty, as well as military talents, par|ticularly by the Duke of CUMBERLAND, under whom he &s;erved in the war in Germany as a &s;ubal|tern officer, in &s;o much that his Royal Highne&s;s had his picture drawn. It was to him the company were fir&s;t indebted for the introduction of perfect military di&s;cipline into their army in India. In the various relations in which he &s;tood, whether dome&s;|tic or public, as the &s;ubject, the citizen, the father, or the friend, he was &s;o uniformly excellent, that the &s;hafts of malevolence, which the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men have but too often felt, &s;eldom reached him; and he may ju&s;tly be reckoned among&s;t that very &s;mall number of created beings, of whom &s;carcely any one had the audacity to &s;peak ill. Upon my fir&s;t arrival in India, I was put under his command, and lived in his family&mdash;when, in&s;tead of deporting him&s;elf towards me with that re&s;erve and au&s;terity which rank and reputation like his, coupled with the circum&s;tance of his being my uncle, might in &s;ome &s;ort have ju&s;tified, he took me into his con|fidence, treated me with the greate&s;t affection, and acted rather as the brother and the equal, than as the parent and &s;uperior; and thus his gentle admo|nitions had more effect in re&s;training the &s;allies of youth, and impetuo&s;ity of my temper, than the &s;our, unpalatable documents of a &s;upercilious pre|ceptor could po&s;&s;ibly have had.</P>
<P>The wonderful effects of this happy temper in &s;waying the &s;tubborn di&s;po&s;ition of head&s;trong youth, was exemplified in another in&s;tance&mdash;of which, &s;ince I am on the &s;ubject, I will inform you. Mr. DUPRES, then governor of Madras, wrote to him about a young gentleman, in the following words:

All the favour I have to reque&s;t of you is to &s;hew him no favour: keep him rigidly to his duty; and, if he requires it, rule him with a rod of iron.

</LETTER></P>
<P>The peculiar &s;tyle of this letter made &s;uch an im|pre&s;&s;ion on my memory, that I am able to give the exact words. Colonel CAMPBELL, however, took his own unalterable method, mildne&s;s&mdash;treated the young gentleman in &s;uch a manner as to rai&s;e in him a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his dignity as a man, the fir&s;t and be&s;t guard again&s;t mi&s;conduct&mdash;and appointed him to the grenadier company. The re&s;ult was an&s;werable to his expectations; for the young man's conduct, both as an officer and a gentleman, was &s;uch in the &s;equel as to reflect credit on him&s;elf and his family; and his very honourable and hopeful career was at la&s;t terminated by a cannon-ball at the &s;iege of Tanjore.</P>
<P>If the veneration in which I &s;hall ever hold this mo&s;t dear and re&s;pected relative admitted of in|crea&s;e, it would certainly receive it from the con|tra&s;t I am every day obliged to draw between him and the wretched <HI>butterflies</HI> who &s;ometimes flutter round us under the name of men: for, how can I help contra&s;ting his inflexible courage, united to angelic mildne&s;s, with the in&s;olence of lilly-livered Hectors, who, con&s;cious of the mo&s;t abject cowar|dice,

I have, in my time, &s;een &s;uch men at fir&s;t the &s;port, and at la&s;t the terror of your blu&s;ter|ing bullies; and I have always thought, that in &s;uch a triumph over their feelings, they had more true merit than men con&s;titutionally courageous: the latter has his valour in common with the mere ani|mal; the other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the valour of &s;entiment. I mean that mo&s;t ignominious of all beings, who, prodigal in offence, yet reluctant in reparation&mdash; who, hoping to find &s;ome per&s;on pa&s;&s;ive as them|&s;elves over whom to triumph, hazard the giving of an in&s;ult, with the malignant view to ga&s;conade over him if he &s;ubmits&mdash;and, if he re&s;ents, to wreak the whole vengeance of law upon him. In &s;ociety with &s;uch men, there is no &s;afety; for they leave you only the ca&s;ual alternative to choo&s;e between &s;hame and ruin.

There are others who, to bring their fellow-creatures down to their own level, brave the execra|tions of mankind, and the vengeance of Heaven: &s;uch harpies do exi&s;t, who, though bold enough to in&s;ult, are tame enough to receive cha&s;ti&s;ement without re&s;i&s;tance; and, though tame enough to &s;ub|mit to cha&s;ti&s;ement, are &s;o furiou&s;ly vindictive as to proclaim their &s;hame, their cowardice, perhaps in the face of an open court, in order to glut their re|venge by the pillage of their adver&s;ary's pur&s;e.

<HEAD>LETTER LX.</HEAD>
<P>PASSING through Madura, I arrived at Trichinopoly, where I met Mr. SULLIVAN, the re&s;ident of Tanjore, who very politely furni&s;hed me with a letter to Mr. HIPPESLEY, his deputy at Tanjore, from whom I received many marks of civility. At that place I had the plea&s;ure of meet|ing a gentleman with whom I had been at college, and for whom I had always entertained a great e&s;teem: this was Colonel FULLARTON. It is an old maxim, that we &s;hould &s;ay nothing but good of the dead&mdash;"De mortuis nil ni&s;i bonum." It is not
<PB N="385" REF="031911_0380_0FEF4CABA16E1330">
a new maxim, I believe, to avoid prai&s;ing the living&punc; I am aware of the indelicacy of it; and therefore purpo&s;ely avoid in this, as I &s;hall in other in&s;tances, &s;peaking the full opinion I entertain. To the general e&s;teem in which he was held by all ranks of people in India, I refer you to Colonel FULLARTON's character: it is of &s;uch a &s;ort, that I wi&s;h to hold it up for your imitation. At a time of life when others have arrived to &s;ome perfection in their profe&s;&s;ion, he made choice of his, and entered for the fir&s;t time into the arduous military department, with a command for which the training of many years is no more than &s;ufficient to prepare other men. The Mini&s;ter of that day gave him this important charge, underwent the clamours of Oppo&s;ition for it, and was ju&s;tified in the event. When the Colonel came to act, &s;o far from being deficient, his whole conduct was di&s;tingui&s;hed, not le&s;s for military talent than courage&mdash;while the mo&s;t fortunate command of temper and captivating addre&s;s &s;ubdued the &s;pirit of prejudice, reconciled the mo&s;t di&s;cordant, and gained him, though a King's Officer, the e&s;teem as much of the Company's as King's troops. In &s;hort, all ranks of people, civil as well as military, whether belonging to King or Com|pany, united in approbation of his conduct&mdash;a thing not before, nor &s;ince, but in the per&s;on of LORD CORNWALLIS.</P>
<P>Too much cannot be &s;aid of the advantages re|&s;ulting from a proper command of temper. To pro|mote that in my FREDERICK, will be attended with little difficulty: on the contrary, my only doubt is, that the placability and mildne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition will too often &s;ubject him to impo&s;ition. JOHN is, however, of a different temper; there is &s;omething in it which requires both admonition and good ex|ample to repre&s;s within proper bounds: to &s;hew him the beauty as well as u&s;e of a mild, cool tem|per,
<PB N="386" REF="031911_0381_0FEF4CB0799B0648">
&s;uch in&s;tances as Colonel FULLARTON may be of weight, and I wi&s;h him to reflect upon it. And here I am reminded of a per&s;on and a circum&s;tance &s;o exactly in point&punc; that I cannot refrain from noticing them: they convey no inadequate idea of the happi|ne&s;s re&s;ulting from a gentlene&s;s of nature, and domi|nion over the mind; and as the per&s;on I allude to is dead, I may &s;peak of him with the greater freedom in that full &s;train of prai&s;e of which his &s;hining virtues de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Of all the men I have ever had the good fortune to know, Sir ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the highe&s;t degree, that heavenly turn of mind, which not only is at peace with it&s;elf, but diffu&s;es harmony and cheerfulne&s;s around it. No bu&s;ine&s;s, however urgent in occa&s;ion, re&s;tricted in point of time, or em|barra&s;&s;ed with difficulty&mdash;no accident, however unex|pected, or event, however &s;ini&s;ter&mdash;none of tho&s;e in|numerable minutiae which fret and chafe the tempers of other men, ever &s;u&s;pended the cool tenor of his thought even for a moment: nothing &s;hook the &s;e|renity of his temper&mdash;nothing deranged the pre&s;ence of his mind: uniform and placid, he in all &s;ituations had the full dominion of him&s;elf, and in the field it gave him a decided &s;uperiority; nor was this felicity of nature confined to his public conduct; it attended him at the dome&s;tic enjoyments of the fire-&s;ide&mdash;at the &s;ocial board&mdash;in the private rece&s;&s;es of his clo&s;et; and the very &s;ame habit of &s;oul which, in his great public duties, rendered him valuable to his Country and formidable to her enemies, gained him the admira|tion and e&s;teem of his friends, the unbounded affec|tion of his family, and the ble&s;&s;ing of all his dependants.</P>
<P>An incident that occurred in my pre&s;ence may &s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure to decipher the mind of this admirable man&mdash;I &s;hall never forget it. Previou&s;ly to his going to India, he had exerted his intere&s;t
<PB N="387" REF="031911_0382_0FEF4CB20E3E8F88">
to obtain from the Ea&s;t India Company &s;ome re|ward for my &s;ervices; and, a few days before his departure, promi&s;ed to &s;peak again to Mr. DE|VAYNES, Chairman of the Ea&s;t India Company. I waited on him on the day he was &s;etting off; he was ju&s;t about to depart, and &s;urrounded by a numerous circle. In the mid&s;t of this bu&s;tle, and the confu|&s;ion, one would &s;uppo&s;e, in&s;eparable from &s;uch a cri&s;is, he recollected his promi&s;e&mdash;told me Mr. DE|VAYNES had that minute taken leave of him, and he had forgot to mention me, but &s;aid that he would write to him on the &s;ubject; and, though he was at the in&s;tant on the point of moving to the carriage that was to carry him off, &s;at down, and with that amiable &s;weetne&s;s of manners and happily collected mind &s;o peculiarly his own, wrote a letter for me to Mr. DE|VAYNES&mdash;holding conver&s;ation, the while, in the mo&s;t lively, engaging manner, with the per&s;ons around him. The conci&s;ene&s;s and per&s;picuity of language in which this letter was couched, will &s;erve to eluci|date what I have &s;aid&mdash;I therefore tran&s;cribe it for you:

<P>Be a&s;&s;ured, my dear boys, (for now I &s;peak to JOHN as well as FREDERICK), that one act of triumph over the temper is worth a million of triumphs over our fellow-creatures, and that the perfect dominion of our mind is more advantageous and laudable than the do|minion over Provinces or Nations.

The opportunity of Captain CAMPBELL tempts me to trouble your lord&s;hip, merely to inform you, that all my letters from Bidanore a&s;cribe in a great degree the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms in that quarter, and the <HI>romantic</HI> Re|volution effected there, to the influence he had with HYAT SAHIB, and to the propo&s;als of &s;urren|der

which he &s;ugge&s;ted, and tran&s;acted with the General and Jemadar. I think it nece&s;&s;ary that you, my lord, may know how much the Public is in|debted to Captain CAMPBELL, who&s;e good fortune in this affair has only been equalled by his good conduct. He is perfectly acquainted with the &s;tate of affairs on the other coa&s;t, and has &s;een and heard much of our tran&s;actions here; &s;o that no per&s;on can give a more clear or unbia&s;&s;ed view of events.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I had al&s;o the good luck to meet, at Tanjore, Mr. BUCHANAN, a very near connection of mine, for whom I had long entertained a &s;incere and warm regard. It has been my misfortune to have been obliged frequent|ly to cen&s;ure &s;ome of my relatives for ill-nature and in|gratitude: I never did &s;o without the mo&s;t painful &s;en|&s;ations. When, on the contrary, I am enabled to &s;peak to their honour, I feel a proportionate &s;hare of plea&s;ure: I am therefore happy in mentioning Mr. BUCHANAN as a man as amiable in his private as re&s;|pectable in his public character; but the &s;atisfaction I felt at this meeting was much alloyed by finding him in a very bad &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>Before I left Tanjore, I had an opportunity of being eye-witne&s;s to that extraordinary and horrid ceremony, the buring of a Gentoo woman with the body of her hu&s;band. As this is a point which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s occa&s;ioned much &s;peculation and &s;ome doubt among Europeans, I inclo&s;e you an accurate account of the ceremony, as minuted down at the time it happened.</P>

<HEAD>De&s;cription of the Ceremony of the Gentoo Women burning them&s;elves with the bodies of their Hu&s;bands.</HEAD>
<P>"This day,&mdash;, I went t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee a Gentoo woman re&s;ign her&s;elf to be burned along with the corp&s;e of her decea&s;ed hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="031911_0385_0FEF4CB9BA155E98">"The place fixed upon for this tragic &s;cene, was a &s;mall i&s;let on the bank of one of the branches of the river Cavery, about a mile to the Northward of the fort of Tanjore.</P>
<P>"When I came to the &s;pot, I found the victim, who appeared to be not above &s;ixteen, &s;itting on the ground, dre&s;&s;ed in the Gentoo manner, with a white cloth wrapped round her, &s;ome white flowers like je&s;&s;amins hanging round her neck, and &s;ome of them hanging from her hair. There were about twenty women &s;itting on their hams round her, holding a white handkerchief, extended horizontally over her head, to &s;hade her from the &s;un, which was exce&s;&s;ively hot, it being then about noon.</P>
<P>"At about twenty yards from where &s;he was &s;itting, and facing her, there were &s;everal Bramins bu&s;y in con&s;tructing a pile with billets of fire-wood: the pile was about eight feet long, and four broad. They fir&s;t began by driving &s;ome upright &s;takes into the ground, and then built up the middle to about the height of three feet and a half with billets of wood.</P>
<P>"The dead hu&s;band, who, from his appearance, &s;eemed to be about &s;ixty years of age, was lying clo&s;e by, &s;tretched out on a bier, made of Bamboo canes. Four Bramins walked in proce&s;&s;ion three times round the dead body, fir&s;t in a direction contrary to the &s;un, and afterwards other three times in a direction with the &s;un, all the while muttering incantations; and at each round or circuit they made, they untwi&s;ted, and immediately again twi&s;ted up the &s;mall long lock of hair which is left un&s;haven at the back of their heads.</P>
<P>"Some other Bramins were in the mean time em|ployed in &s;prinklin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> water out of a green leaf, rolled up like a cup, upon a &s;mall heap of cakes of dry cow-dung, with which the pile was afterwards to be &s;et on fire.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="031911_0386_0FEF4CBB4DF6A178">"An old Bramin &s;at at the North-ea&s;t corner of the pile upon his hams, with a pair of &s;pectacles on, read|ing, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Sha&s;ter, or their Scriptures, from a book compo&s;ed of Cajan leaves.</P>
<P>"Having been pre&s;ent now nearly an hour, I in|quired when they meant to &s;et the pile on fire: they an&s;wered, in about two hours. As this &s;pectacle was mo&s;t melancholy, and naturally &s;truck me with horror, and as I had only gone there to a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf of the <HI>truth of &s;uch &s;acrifices being made,</HI> I went away towards the fort. After I was gone about five hundred yards, they &s;ent &s;ome one to tell me they would burn imme|diately; on which I returned, and found the woman had been moved from where &s;he was &s;itting to the river, where the Bramins were bathing her. On taking her out of the water, they put &s;ome money in her hand, which &s;he dipped in the river, and divided among the Bramins: &s;he had then a yellow cloth rolled partially round her. They put &s;ome red colour, about the &s;ize of a &s;ixpence, on the centre of her forehead, and rubbed &s;omething that appeared to me to be clay. She was then led to the pile, round which &s;he walked three times as the &s;un goes: &s;he then mounted it at the North-ea&s;t corner, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;at her&s;elf down on the right &s;ide of her hu&s;band, who had been pre|viou&s;ly laid upon the pile. She then un&s;crewed the pins which fa&s;tened the jewels or &s;ilver rings on her arms: after &s;he had taken them off, &s;he &s;hut them, and &s;crewed in the pins again, and gave one to each of two women who were &s;tanding: &s;he un&s;crewed the ear-rings, and other toys, with great compo&s;ure, and divided them among the women who were with her. There &s;eemed to be &s;ome little &s;quabble about the di&s;|tribution of her jewels, which &s;he &s;ettled with great preci&s;ion; and then, falling ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y backwards, pulled a fold of the yellow cloth over her face, turned her brea&s;t towards her hu&s;bands &s;ide, and laid her right
<PB N="392" REF="031911_0387_0FEF4CBF7AC70EE0">
arm over his brea&s;t; and in this po&s;ture &s;he remained without moving.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t before &s;he lay down, the Bramins put &s;ome rice in her lap, and al&s;o &s;ome in the mouth and on the long grey beard of her hu&s;band: they then &s;prinkled &s;ome water on the head, brea&s;t and feet of both, and tied them gently together round the middle with a &s;lender bit of rope: they then rai&s;ed, as it were, a little wall of wood lengthways on two &s;ides of the pile, &s;o as to rai&s;e it above the level of the bodies; and then put cro&s;s pieces, &s;o as to prevent the billets of wood from pre&s;&s;ing on them: they then poured on the pile, above where the woman lay&punc; a potful of &s;omething that appeared to me to be oil; after this they heaped on more wood, to the height of about four feet above where the bodies were built in; &s;o that all I now &s;aw was a &s;tack of fire-wood.</P>
<P>"One of the Bramins, I ob&s;erved, &s;tood at the end of the pile next the woman's head&mdash;was calling to her through the inter&s;tices of the wood, and laughed &s;everal times during the conver&s;ation. La&s;tly, they over&s;pread the pile with wet &s;traw, and tied it on with ropes.</P>
<P>"A Bramin then took a handful of &s;traw, which he &s;et on fire at the little heap of burning cakes of cow-dung; and, &s;tanding to windward of the pile, he let the wind drive the flame from the &s;traw till it catched the pile. Fortunately, at this in&s;tant, the wind ro&s;e much higher than it had been any part of the day&punc; and in an in&s;tant the flames pervaded the whole pile, and it burnt with great fury. I li&s;tened a few &s;econds, but could not di&s;tingui&s;h any &s;hrieks, which might perhaps be owing to my being then to windward. In a very few minutes, the pile became a heap of a&s;hes.</P>
<P>"During the whole time of this proce&s;s, which la&s;ted from fir&s;t to la&s;t above two hours before we lo&s;t &s;ight of the woman by her being built up in the middle of the pile, I kept my eyes almo&s;t con&s;tantly upon her;
<PB N="393" REF="031911_0388_0FEF4CC10F329C18">
and I declare to God that I could not perceive, either in her countenance or limbs, the lea&s;t trace of either horror, fear, or even he&s;itation: her countenance was perfectly compo&s;ed and placid; and &s;he was not, I am po&s;itive, either intoxicated or &s;tupified. From &s;everal circum&s;tances, I thought the Bramins exulted in this helli&s;h &s;acrifice, and did not &s;eem at all di&s;plea&s;ed that Europeans &s;hould be witne&s;&s;es of it."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXI.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO every &s;tep of my journey has been marked by occurrences &s;o unexpected, and ac|cidents &s;o extraordinary, that I &s;hould feel &s;ome re|pugnance to relate them, le&s;t my veracity &s;hould be called in que&s;tion, were they not atte&s;ted by &s;o many living per&s;ons of re&s;pectability, and by written docu|ments of authority on record. Were one to con|&s;ider them merely as the offspring of fiction, they would perhaps have intere&s;t enough to catch the at|tention;
<PB N="394" REF="031911_0389_0FEF4CC408425588">
but, viewing them as facts, they borrow, from their number and rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as well as from their &s;ingularity, &s;o much of the complexion of imaginary adventure, that the combination cannot, I think, fail to intere&s;t your mind as well as your feelings.</P>
<P>Arrived at Nagapatnam, within a &s;hort run of Madras, it is natural for you to &s;uppo&s;e that adven|ture was at an end, and that fortune, fatigued by the ince&s;&s;ant exertion of her caprice, might have left me to proceed the &s;hort re&s;idue of my way without fur|ther mole&s;tation. It fell out otherwi&s;e: &s;he had marked me as her game, and re&s;olved to worry me to the la&s;t moment; for, as we approached Madras, we were cha&s;ed by a French frigate, and taken near Fort St. George.</P>
<P>This appeared to me the greate&s;t misfortune I had yet met with, and likely to be the mo&s;t fatal in its con&s;equences. In order to explain this, I mu&s;t recur to certain circum&s;tances, which though I was informed of them &s;ince my rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e from Hydernagur, I did not relate to you, beca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> they were no way connected with my narrative till now.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur SUFFREIN, the French Admiral, having a number of Briti&s;h pri&s;oners in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, whom he found it extremely inconvenient to &s;upport, made a propo&s;al for an exchange&mdash;which, from &s;ome failure in the conveyance, or ambiguity in the terms of the corre&s;pondence, was neglected.</P>
<P>The motives or accidents which gave ri&s;e to this neglect have never been completely developed; and perhaps the Admiral him&s;elf, Sir EDWARD HUGHES, and Lord MACARTNEY, were the only per&s;ons who knew the bottom of that tran&s;action. In &s;uch ca&s;es, however, the ignorance of fact is generally &s;upplied by conjecture; and men have pre&s;umed to cen&s;ure unequivocally on the mere hypothetical &s;ugge&s;tions of
<PB N="395" REF="031911_0390_0FEF4CC5951AC560">
their own imaginations. Candour, however, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, where it could not &s;peak with certainty, would &s;peak with caution. An Hi&s;torian, particularly, &s;hould &s;teer clear of party rancour, and not &s;uffer the pre|judice or malignity which mi&s;led him&s;elf, to go down to and mi&s;lead po&s;terity. Where po&s;itive proof is wanting, if we are obliged to decide, we mu&s;t judge by analogy and inference; and in the ca&s;e now before us, we have little but the characters of the per&s;ons concerned to guide us in our deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of the horrid cata&s;trophe which &s;ucceeded the ne|glect of exchanging pri&s;oners, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that any one but Mon&s;ieur SU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">REIN him&s;elf could have had a concepti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. To &s;uppo&s;e, that, under &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion, our leading men would have he&s;itated to prevent it, would be to &s;uppo&s;e their in|tellects weak, and their hearts corrupt and inhuman. I fancy it will be dif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ult to fa&s;ten on Lord MACART|NEY either the one or the other; for he was wi&s;e and humane: tho&s;e whom the di&s;appointment of un|rea&s;onable expectations, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alevolence of party, have induced to &s;u&s;pect his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d&s;hip's heart, have been forced by his conduct to revere his talents; and the breath of calumny has never touched the humanity of Sir EDWARD HUGHES. Whatever their motives, therefore, may have been&mdash;rea&s;on, con&s;cience, and candour, mu&s;t acquit them of the con&s;equences. It &s;hould be recollected, too, that Mon&s;ieur SUFFREIN's character was a very probable &s;ecurity, in the mind of men of &s;en&s;e and honour, again&s;t any act of horrid inhumanity; his conduct as an officer had made a new aera in the Naval Hi&s;tory of France: his talents and courage might be compared, without di&s;advantage, to tho&s;e of the be&s;t of our Briti&s;h Admirals; and he had exhibited marks of uncommon genero&s;ity to tho&s;e whom the chance of war had thrown into his hands. It would therefore have been &s;omething more than
<PB N="396" REF="031911_0391_0FEF327EF4DA51B8">
pre&s;cience to have pre&s;uppo&s;ed what actually hap|pened; and I declare mo&s;t &s;olemnly, that the inference I draw from the whole information I have had on the &s;ubject is, that, calamitous though the event was, it attaches no po&s;itive guilt on any of the parties con|cerned. The fact is plainly this: The French Ad|miral having no place on the coa&s;t where he could &s;e|cure his pri&s;oners, and grieving, as he him&s;elf &s;ub|&s;equently wrote to Mr. HASTINGS, to &s;ee the un|happy men, who had been &s;ix or &s;even months at &s;ea, dying of the &s;curvy, delivered over the pri|&s;oners, to the number of above three hundred, to HYDER. Their fate afterwards was &s;uch as it would harrow up your &s;oul to hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elated.</P>
<P>Take the whole of the circum&s;tances into one glance, and &s;ee what my feelings mu&s;t have been on finding my&s;elf once more a pri&s;oner. HYDER ALLI, who was, when compared with the wor&s;t de&s;pots of the European world, a mon&s;ter, mu&s;t yet be con|&s;idered, when put in compari&s;on with his &s;ucce&s;&s;or TIPPOO, mild and merciful. HYDER, from policy and hypocri&s;y, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome lenity to the pri&s;oners who fell into his hands. In&s;tances are known where Briti&s;h captives have broke through the crowd that &s;urrounded him into his pre&s;ence for protection&mdash; when he has hypocritically feigned anger, threatened the per&s;ons who had treated them ill, reprobated &s;everity, and &s;ent them off &s;atisfied for the pre&s;ent. TIPPOO, on the contrary, was &s;o perfectly &s;avage, that cruelty &s;eemed to be, not only the internal habit of his &s;oul, but the guide of all his actions, the mov|ing principle of his policy, the rule of his public con|duct, and the &s;ource of his private gratification. Like the tyger which, BUFFON tells us, kills the whole flock bofore he begins to feed, every appetite of his yielded to the more urgent calls of barbarity; and while one drop of blood remained un&s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led, one agony
<PB N="397" REF="031911_0392_0FEF4CCAEB0BFD30">
uninflicted, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear un&s;hed, the natural appetites of TIPPOO &s;tood &s;u&s;pended, and the luxuries of life courted his enjoyment in vain. Like the hyena which THOMPSON calls the felle&s;t of the fell, the fury of his nature was neither to be controuled by re&s;i&s;tance, nor a&s;&s;uaged by blandi&s;hments. Aloof from the ge|neral order of the workings of Providence, he &s;tands a &s;ingle in&s;tance, in which the Omnipotent has pre&s;ented a glowing living picture, ALL SHADE: not one ray breaks in, to relieve the gloomy a&s;pect of the piece; but, di&s;tinct from the whole human race, of him alone it may be &s;aid, that he never yet di&s;clo&s;ed, even for a moment, one &s;park of virtue.</P>
<P>From barbarity &s;o i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">exible to tho&s;e taken in the ordinary chance of war, what could I expect if I fell again into his hands&mdash;I who had been the in&s;trument of one of his chief Governors' defection&mdash;who had, by my negociations, contributed to deprive him of a Province, and, what perhaps might have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad greater weight with him, robbed him of the gratification of a long harboured revenge, by putting his enemy HYAT SAHIB under the protection of the Company? Diabolical vengeance never perhaps met with a &s;ubject of &s;uch &s;ublime enjoyment, as the torturing of me would have been to this mon&s;ter. Couple this, then, my FREDERICK, with the fears of SUFFREIN's doing by me as he had already done by the other Engli&s;h pri&s;oners&mdash;and gue&s;s what my terror and con&s;terna|tion mu&s;t have been at falling into the hands of the French!</P>
<P>Having &s;truck our colours to the French frigate, the Captain ordered us to follow her, and &s;teered to the northward. We obeyed him for &s;ome time: at length night fell; and, a fre&s;h and favourable breeze fortunately aiding the attempt, we put about, ran for Madras, and luckily dropt anchor &s;afely in the roads. In the e&s;capes I had hitherto had, there was always
<PB N="398" REF="031911_0393_0FEF4CCC77F83F40">
&s;ome di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from them&mdash;In this in&s;tance, my joy was pure and unqualified; and I looked forward with a rea&s;on|able hope that the wor&s;t was all over.</P>
<P>Here I found Lord MACARTNEY governor, &s;trug|gling to &s;upport the credit of the Company, and directing their affairs through &s;uch embarra&s;&s;ments and difficulties as made the mo&s;t wi&s;e and temperate de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s. So arduous an undertaking as the government of Madras then was, has rarely occurred; and a more &s;ucce&s;sful final accompli&s;hment is not to be in&s;tanced. In the ince&s;&s;ant conflicts to which he was expo&s;ed, he maintained his po&s;t with inflexible firmne&s;s and unabated energ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of mind&mdash;and, in the mo&s;t trying circum&s;tances, di&s;charged his important duty with zeal, integrity and wi&s;dom.

Upon my arrival there, Sir JOHN MAC|PHERSON, who was in the Supreme Council, gave me a kind invitation to live at his hou&s;e, and pre&s;ented me to Mr. HASTINGS, with whom I entered into a negociation on behalf of HYAT SAHIB, which will appear by the following letters:

<DATE><HI>May</HI> 3, 1783.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>HONOURABLE SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Indi&s;po&s;ition has put it out of my power, &s;ince the fir&s;t day after my arrival here, to have the ho|nour of paying you my re&s;pects, and of laying before you, for the information of the board, the objects of my mi&s;&s;ion to your &s;uperintending govern|ment.</P>
<P>As the&s;e objects are of public importance, and as ill health may prevent me, for &s;ome time longer, from having the honour of waiting upon you, I take the liberty to beg your attention to this addre&s;s.</P>
<P>The great revolution in favour of the India Company upon the we&s;t &s;ide of India, and to which I had the happine&s;s of being in &s;ome little degree in&s;trumental, has been certainly brought about by the zeal and &s;pirit of General MAT|THEWS; but that officer a&s;cribes to the orders and &s;upplies of your government the principal merit of the undertaking: he looks to the &s;ame govern|ment
<PB N="400" REF="031911_0395_0FEF4CD0AF242938">
for &s;upport in the arrangement which he has made, and may make, for the &s;ecurity of the con|quered province.</P>
<P>The hurry in which I left him, and his anxiety for my &s;peedy communication of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, gave no time for a formal communication to the Governor-General and council, of the particulars of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, and of the arrangements which he wi&s;hed to be adopted. He wrote a &s;hort account of the fir&s;t to the Pre&s;idency of Fort St. George; and gave me a public letter to the Commander in Chief of the Military E&s;tabli&s;hment of that Pre&s;idency to which I particularly belong, in atte&s;tation of the &s;ervices I rendered in the negociation between him and the Governor of Bidanore, for the &s;urrender of that capital and province. A copy of that letter I have the plea&s;ure to lay before you.</P>
<P>As I was charged with a particular commi&s;&s;ion from HYAT SAHIB, the manager of the Bidanore province, to the Governor-General and council, as appears by his letter, which I had the honour of pre&s;enting to you, General MATTHEWS gave me, in verbal in&s;tructions, and memorandums written in his own hand, the particulars of what he wi&s;hed me to repre&s;ent to your Government: he gave me, be&s;ides, &s;hort notes of introduction to two of the members of Government, whom he knew per&s;o|nally&mdash;referring them to me for an account of his &s;ituation, and allowing me, I believe, more credit than I de&s;erve, for the &s;hare I had in contributing to his final acqui&s;ition of Bidanore without drawing a &s;word.</P>
<P>It would be tedious, and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it for the detail of conver&s;ation than of a public addre&s;s, to inform you of the various &s;teps that led to the &s;urrender of the capital and province of Bidanore.

My efforts in the&s;e conver&s;ations ended ultimately in the mo&s;t ri|gorous di&s;tre&s;s to my&s;elf: I was put in irons, and remained &s;o for four months, in a &s;ituation only of exi&s;tence without any hopes of ever e&s;caping. When General MATHEWS had &s;tormed the Ghauts, HYAT SAHIB &s;ent for me, and, after va|rious &s;truggles, and much indeci&s;ion, agreed to my proceeding to the Engli&s;h camp; and I conducted General MATHEWS, almo&s;t unattended, into Bi|danore. HYAT SAHIB at length agreed to &s;ubmit: but as, in his various conver&s;ations with me be|fore and after that event, he made a very par|ticular di&s;tinction between the government of Bom|bay and the chief government of the Engli&s;h in Indo&s;tan, &s;o he propo&s;ed that I &s;hould immediately depart, after he had given up the place and all the forts of the Province, with a letter to you, to ob|tain your &s;anction to me to his arrangements with the Engli&s;h General.</P>
<P>The&s;e arrangements were not even clearly defi|ned before my departure; and &s;o anxious was he for my &s;peedy arrival at Calcutta, that he only gave me the general propo&s;itions that are contained in his letter.</P>
<P>Permit me here to ob&s;erve, that it is by the treat|ment which HYAT SAHIB meets with, that the other chiefs of HYDER's country will e&s;timate the advantage of abandoning the intere&s;ts of TIPPOO SAHIB, or will confirm their dependence upon him. TIPPOO was prevented by his father from all inter|cour&s;e with the Governors of his provinces, or any interference in country affairs; &s;o that tho&s;e left in charge at his father's death are &s;trangers to him, and are men to whom he has little attachment. He is, be&s;ides, con&s;idered to be of a cruel di&s;po&s;ition.
<PB N="402" REF="031911_0397_0FEF4D2FC9D1CB40">
His father was cruel upon a political principle: he is thought to be &s;o from nature.</P>
<P>The unfortunate differences about money which aro&s;e in General MATHEWS's camp, and of which you will probably hear from the Pre&s;idency of Bombay, took up much of the General's time, and may have retarded his operations: however, his &s;ucce&s;s in the reduction of Mangalore gives a &s;ecurity to his conque&s;ts. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">evenues of the Bidanore Province are about twenty lacks of pago|das per annum.</P>
<P>The particular &s;ituation of the capital merits at|tention. It is placed in a valley of con&s;iderable extent in circumference: according to the be&s;t ob|&s;ervation I could make, there is an a&s;cent to it, from all &s;ides, of near &s;even miles: it can only be approached by four roads, which are cut among the hills, and which were judiciou&s;ly fortified with great pains by HYDER: woods, to the depth of many miles, are a frontier round its &s;kirts; and where the&s;e admitted a pa&s;&s;age, HYDER took the precaution to plant bamboos and thorns&mdash;&s;o that I have little fear but that General MATHEWS will be able to defend the&s;e pa&s;&s;es; and as for pro|vi&s;ions, and military &s;tores of all kinds, that were found in Bidanore, of the latter particularly, what, according to General MATHEWS's own declara|tion, would equip nine &s;uch armies as his.</P>
<P>Cundapore is the next &s;ea-port to Bidanore, and is di&s;tant about fifty miles: Mangalore is di&s;tant about a hundred miles. The road leading from Mangalore joins with that from Cundapore, where the a&s;cent of the hills commence: another road from Bidanore leads to Seringapatam, and a fourth into the Marhatta country.</P>
<P>It was from the lower country, along the &s;ea|coa&s;t, between Onore and Mangalore, which is watered by many rivers, and is the be&s;t cultivated
<PB N="403" REF="031911_0398_0FEF4D3167C0AA90">
country I ever &s;aw, that HYDER got the greate&s;t part of his provi&s;ions for his army in the Carnatic; and, independent of the advantages which the Company have gained by the acqui&s;ition of the&s;e countries, the con&s;equent lo&s;&s;es of the My&s;oreans are immen&s;e, and &s;uch as will di&s;able them from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the French in the Carnatic.</P>
<P>It becomes not an officer of my rank to make any ob&s;ervations that relate to the conduct of the different governments of my employers; but I am obliged to ob&s;erve, in ju&s;tice to HYAT SAHIB's declaration to me, that he will not rely upon any arrangement made in his favour by the Governor and council of Bombay, unle&s;s he has a &s;peedy an&s;wer to his letter from this government. He has reque&s;ted me to return with that an&s;wer, and with the &s;anction of the Governor-General to the cowl given to him by General MATHEWS. Though I am worn down by my &s;ufferings in pri&s;on, and my health can &s;carcely enable me to be carried by land, I am ready to undertake this &s;ervice; for I know it is the greate&s;t I may ever have it in my power to render to the company and to my country.</P>
<P>My return to the other coa&s;t with a favourable an&s;wer to HYAT SAHIB, will be the &s;ignal to other Chiefs to throw off the yoke of TIPPOO; and if Colonel LONG has made any progre&s;s in the Coim|batore country, or that General MATHEWS has not been too &s;everely pre&s;&s;ed by TIPPOO, I may arrive upon the other coa&s;t in time to be of real u&s;e to the company.</P>
<P>I know, Honourable Sir, the liberal and great &s;y&s;tem of your admini&s;tration: I will not, there|fore, point out any little circum&s;tances about the footing upon which I &s;hould return to HYAT SAHIB, or remain upon the other coa&s;t.

<P>I have directed the affairs of the Soobeh of Hy|dernagur for &s;ome years pa&s;t, on the part of the NAV|VAUB HYDER. When lately attacked by the victorious forces of the Engli&s;h under the command of General MATHEWS, I oppo&s;ed him, and fulfil|led

If I had been di&s;po&s;ed, I had it in my power to have appropriated this collected wealth to other pur|po&s;es; but, from a regard to the high fortune of the KING of ENGLAND, and the uprightne&s;s and integrity of the Engli&s;h people, I have included my&s;elf in the number of your &s;ervants, and have determined, with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity and purity of heart, to &s;erve you well and faithfully.

<SALUTE>HONOURABLE SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Some time ago, I did my&s;elf the honour of writ|ing to you, on the &s;ubject of my mi&s;&s;ion from HYAT SAHIB to this government.</P>
<P>It is with plea&s;ure I now under&s;tand that you have come to the re&s;olution of &s;ending an an&s;wer to his letter. I cannot help delivering it as my opinion, that a decided and avowed protection granted to him from this government, will be pro|ductive of great public utility: but &s;hould you, and the other gentlemen of the council, think pro|per to decline this, from motives be&s;t known to your&s;elves, and of which I &s;hall not pretend to judge, I beg leave humbly to repre&s;ent, that the &s;ooner HYAT SAHIB's letter is acknowledged, the more &s;atisfactory it will be to him, and the more efficacious in its probable good con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I am ready and anxious to proceed immediately to the other coa&s;t with the an&s;wer to HYAT SAHIB, and &s;hall take the liberty of hoping that you will
<PB N="407" REF="031911_0402_0FEF4D3C5A7404B8">
give me in&s;tructions to remain &s;ome time with him, that he may have an opportunity of tran&s;mitting, through me, any communication that he may wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h with this government. I have the plea|&s;ure to inform you, that that Pre&s;idency to which I particularly belong, have granted me their con|&s;ent to be employed in the final arrangement of the Bidanore treaty, &s;hould your board think proper to choo&s;e me as a fit per&s;on; and they have further unanimou&s;ly done me the honour to approve of my conduct in the commencement of this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the appointments you may judge right to allow me, I tru&s;t entirely to your own ideas of propriety. I wi&s;h for nothing more than what is &s;ufficient to defray the expences of &s;uch a jour|ney, and to enable me to maintain that character in a &s;ituation of this kind which is requi&s;ite to pro|mote the public good.</P>

<P>After &s;ome delay, I received in&s;tructions, together with a letter from Mr. HASTINGS for HYAT, with which I &s;et off in order to deliver it into his own hands, as follows:
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER TO CAPTAIN DONALD CAMPBELL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have it in command from the Honourable the Governor-General and council, to tran&s;mit you the inclo&s;ed an&s;wer from the Governor-General to the
<PB N="408" REF="031911_0403_0FEF4D3E15EA1F68">
letter which you brought from HYAT SAHIB, the Fou&s;dar of Bidanore, to this government, upon the occa&s;ion of his &s;urrendering that country to the company. As you propo&s;e to return to Bidanore, the Board reque&s;t that you will deliver this an&s;wer in per&s;on to HYAT SAHIB, with a&s;&s;urances from them of every protection and &s;upport which the eminent &s;ervices rendered by him to the company give him &s;o good a right to expect, and which they have it in their power to grant; and you will acquaint him, that they have further agreed to recommend him in &s;uch terms to the Honourable the Court of Directors, as may encourage him to hope for every attention from their ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the great importance of the acqui&s;i|tion of Bidanore to the company, its proportionable di&s;advantage to the enemy, and the magnitude of the object to be obtained by holding out every po&s;&s;ible incitement and encouragement to the Mana|gers of the My&s;ore country, to throw off a new and un&s;ettled dependence on the enemy's govern|ment, in order to obtain a more &s;ecure and bene|ficial tenure from the company's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the Board are the more readily inclined to afford this early return to the advances of HYAT SAHIB, in the hope that it will in&s;pire him with fre&s;h confi|dence in the Engli&s;h government, and rivet his at|tachment to it.</P>
<P>It will be at your option, either to return im|mediately with HYAT SAHIB's an&s;wer to the Go|vernor-General's letter, if you &s;hall deem it of &s;uf|ficient con&s;equence to require it, or to remain with him, if you conceive that your re&s;idence there for any time will be more conducive to the public in|tere&s;ts; but, in either ca&s;e, you are de&s;ired to re|port the particulars of your reception and proceed|ings
<PB N="409" REF="031911_0404_0FEF4D4262DD4718">

<P>It would be unpardonable in me to let this occa&s;ion pa&s;s, without expre&s;&s;ing the high &s;en&s;e I entertain of Mr. HASTINGS's politene&s;s, and Sir JOHN MAC|PHERSON's kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality, during my &s;tay at Calcutta. As to Mr. HASTINGS, in his public capacity, it would be pre&s;umptuous and injudicious to &s;ay much, as he now &s;tands for the judgment of the highe&s;t tribunal in this country. My own ob&s;er|vation leads me to con&s;ider him as a man of &s;ound, acute and brilliant talents, and of a va&s;t and compre|hen&s;ive mind&mdash;of manners &s;ociable, amiable, meek and unaffected&mdash;and of a di&s;po&s;ition truly benevolent. His &s;uperior knowledge of the political intere&s;ts of Indo&s;tan, and particularly of the affairs of the Ea&s;t India company, has never been que&s;tioned; and, if the &s;uffrage of the people of India may be allowed to decide, his conduct as Governor-General, though, like every thing human, intermixed with error, was, on the whole, great and laudable&mdash;for I declare I &s;carcely ever heard a man in India, Native or Euro|pean, cen&s;ure him, although he was often the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation with all per&s;ons and in all companies in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ocial virtues of Sir JOHN MACPHERSON are &s;o well known, that it would be &s;uperfluous to notice them. The &s;ame friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality I experi|enced in his hou&s;e, has been &s;hared by many, who are not backward in doing him ample ju&s;tice on that
<PB N="410" REF="031911_0405_0FEF4D43F4A72040">
head. But his conduct during his &s;hort admini&s;tration can be known only by tho&s;e who make the political concerns of India a &s;ubject ef &s;tudious attention. To enter into a detail of his various wi&s;e regulations for the re&s;toration of the company's affairs, would be de&s;tructive of the end I propo&s;e, which is, by a con|ci&s;e and &s;imple &s;ummary of the whole, to render a fair picture of his admini&s;tration &s;o clear as to be under&s;tood by any per&s;on, however ignorant he may be of the politics of that country, and &s;o brief as not to di&s;cou|rage the reading of it.</P>
<P>Sir JOHN MACPHERSON took the reins of govern|ment into his hands on the fir&s;t of February, 1785. He found the company's revenues dimini&s;hed, and their expenditure increa&s;ed, by the continual claims of Proprietors, Directors, and Mini&s;ters, to a &s;hare in the patronage of Mr. HASTINGS&mdash;and a public debt accumulating to an enormous amount. He there|fore &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of putting in practice every ex|pedient po&s;&s;ible, and trying every experiment that the &s;tate of the country &s;ugge&s;ted, as likely to promote an increa&s;e of the revenue, a diminution of the public expenditure, and a liquidation of the debt. He, therefore, on the fourteenth day of his admini&s;tration, commenced a reform, which he continued with in|defatigable zeal and indu&s;try to introduce through the various departments of government&mdash;and, beginning with him&s;elf, di&s;charged his body-guards. While he was thus employed in India, the Company and Par|liament in England were unremittingly engaged in con&s;idering and molding into &s;hape a &s;y&s;tem of reform al&s;o; and, extraordinary as it may appear, the fact is, that the &s;agacity of Mr. MACPHERSON had adopted by anticipation, and actually reduced to practice, the identical &s;peculative reforms which the Parliament and Company were proceeding upon in England; and the general plan of reform which pa&s;&s;ed the court of direc|tors
<PB N="411" REF="031911_0406_0FEF4D46C634DE00">
on the eleventh of April, 1785, had been actually carried into execution by Sir JOHN MACPHERSON in Bengal, in the months of February, March and April, 1785. He made arrangements for the diffu|&s;ion of knowledge&mdash;e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ettlement of Pulo Penang, or Prince of Wales's I&s;land&mdash;&s;ettled the bank of Calcutta on a firm ba&s;is&mdash;regulated the markets&mdash;and, by a plan of his own conception, &s;ecu|red the Company from the accu&s;tomed fraudulent compo&s;itions with Zemindars, by bonding their ba|lances, and making the bonds cancelable only by the Court of Directors. In fine, he introduced and car|ried into effect a &s;y&s;tem of reform which had a mo&s;t &s;udden and &s;alutary effect on the Briti&s;h affairs in In|dia; and in an admini&s;tration of only eighteen months, he had the felicity to perceive the fruits of his wi&s;dom and indu&s;try maturing&mdash;to receive that be&s;t of earth|ly rewards, the e&s;teem and applau&s;e of his fellow-citizens&mdash;and to be honoured by the be&s;t of Sovereigns with the dignity of a Baronet.</P>
<P>While I was at Sir JOHN MACPHERSON's hou&s;e, I happened, in conver&s;ation one day with Mr. MA|CAULEY, Sir JOHN's Secretary, to be talking over &s;ome part of my adventures; and found to my a&s;toni&s;hment, that he had, in his route to India, acci|dentally hired the very &s;ervant whom I had lo&s;t at Trie&s;te by &s;ending him for letters to Venice; and Mr. MACAULY a&s;&s;ured me, that he found him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of all the good qualities I had expected to meet in him: but the poor fellow had died before my arrival at Calcutta, to my great mortification and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>As the &s;ea&s;on in which I was to leave Calcutta was very unfavourable for a voyage by &s;ea, and the coa&s;t thereabouts is one of the mo&s;t inho&s;pitable in the world, I &s;et off by land for Madras, and in my way had an opportunity of &s;urveying that curious and
<PB N="412" REF="031911_0407_0FEF4D48546B7E48">
grote&s;que monument of &s;uper&s;titious folly, called the Jagranaut Pagoda. It is an immen&s;e, barbarous &s;tructure, of a kind of pyramidal form, embelli&s;hed with devices cut in &s;tone-work, not more &s;ingular than di&s;gu&s;ting. Chri&s;tian idolators, in forming types and figures of divine beings, always endeavour to repre&s;ent them with per&s;onal beauty, as proportionate to their divine nature as human &s;kill can make it. Tho&s;e Pagans, on the contrary, in forming their idols, ca&s;t out every ve&s;tige of beauty&mdash;every thing that, by the con&s;ent of Mankind, is &s;uppo&s;ed to convey plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations; and, in their place, &s;ub&s;titute the mo&s;t extravagant, unnatural deformity, the mo&s;t loath|&s;ome na&s;tine&s;s, the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting ob&s;cenity. It is not in language to convey an adequate idea of their temples and idols; and if it was, no purpo&s;e could be an&s;wered by it, only the excitement of painful and abominable &s;en&s;ations. To keep pace with the figures of their idols, a chief Bramin, by &s;ome accur&s;ed ar|tificial means, (by herbs, I believe), has brought to a mo&s;t unnatural form, and enormous dimen&s;ions, that which decency forbids me to mention; and the pure and &s;potle&s;s women, who from infancy have been &s;hut up from the &s;ight of men, even of their bro|thers, are brought to ki&s;s this di&s;gu&s;ting and mi&s;|&s;hapen mon&s;ter, under the prepo&s;terous belief that it promotes fecundity.</P>
<P>In this Pagoda &s;tands the figure of Jagranaut, (their god under Brama); and a &s;ightly figure it is truly!&mdash;nothing more than a black &s;tone, in an irregu|lar pyramidal form, having two rich diamonds in the top by way of eyes, and a no&s;e and mouth painted red. For this god, five hundred prie&s;ts are daily employed in boiling food, which, as he &s;eldom eats it, they doubtle&s;s convert to their own u&s;e in the evening.</P>
<P>I &s;topped at Vizagapatnam for a few days with Mr. RUSSEL, who was chief of that place. His &s;tyle of
<PB N="413" REF="031911_0408_0FEF4D4CEB1B1860">
living was &s;o exactly &s;imilar to that of an elegant fa|mily re&s;iding at their country-hou&s;e in England, that I felt my&s;elf more happy and comfortable than I had been &s;ince my arrival in India; and that happine&s;s was much increa&s;ed by meeting Mr. MAXTON, who was married to Mr. RUSSEL's daughter. This gen|tleman and I had, when mere boys, been &s;hipmates on our fir&s;t going out to India: a warm friend&s;hip took place between us, which has met with no inter|ruption&punc; but rather increa&s;ed from lap&s;e of time, and greater habits of intimacy. To &s;ee a man whom I &s;o entirely e&s;teemed, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t per|fect dome&s;tic felicity, and &s;urrounded by a number of amiable connections and friends, was to me a &s;ub|ject of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing contemplation.</P>

<P>LEAVING Vizagapatam, I took my route along the coa&s;t, and arrived at Ma&s;ulipatam, where I heard rumours of the unfortunate fate of Gene|ral MATHEWS. This threw &s;uch a damp upon my &s;pirits, that all the ho&s;pitality and kindne&s;s of Mr. DANIEL, the chief, could &s;carcely rai&s;e me from de|&s;pondence; and on my arrival at Madras, I found the whole amply confirmed.</P>
<P>As HYAT SAHIB's affair yet remained un&s;ettled, and I con&s;idered my&s;elf in a degree pledged to ob|tain him &s;ome &s;atisfaction for his &s;ervices in &s;ur|rendering the province of Bidanore, and to fulfil my

engagements with him and the Supreme Council&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> determined to proceed to Bombay, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;a&s;ter of General MATHEWS, which had en|tirely cru&s;hed all my private pro&s;pects in that quarter, and to co-operate with HYAT SAHIB in &s;uch mea&s;ures as might yet remain to us for promoting the public good. I left Madras, therefore, and pro&s;ecuted my journey without any material interruption until I reached Palam|cotah, where the chagrin ari&s;ing from my various di&s;appointments, co-operating with fatigue and climate, threw me into a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, which confined me to my bed for five or &s;ix weeks. Upon recovering a little, I crawled on to Anjengo, where, at the hou&s;e of Mr. HUTCHINSON, the Re&s;ident, (who treated me with cordial kindne&s;s), I waited for an opportunity of getting to Bombay, and during that time laid in a &s;tock of &s;trength and &s;pirits: at length a Europe &s;hip touching at Anjengo on her way to Bombay, I obtained a pa&s;&s;age and proceeded.</P>
<P>At Bombay I found HYAT SAHIB, it having been deemed expedient to &s;end him away from Bidanore on the approach of TIPPOO with his army, where I re|ceived from him a confirmation of what I have &s;tated re&s;pecting General MATHEWS receiving only two lacks of rupees and a necklace. And now, as peace was negociating between us and TIPPOO, and my re|maining on the Malabar coa&s;t could be of little u&s;e, I determined to return to the Carnatic. And here I have an incident to add to the many di&s;agreeable oc|currences of my life, in which, with intentions the mo&s;t innocent, I was made the &s;ubject of obloquy and unmerited &s;candal.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at the time I was leaving Bombay, a young lady, the daughter of a per&s;on formerly of high ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k in India, and now a member of Parliament, but who&s;e name it would be u&s;ele&s;s to mention wi&s;hed to return to the Carnatic; and I, at the reque&s;t of her&s;elf, and
<PB N="415" REF="031911_0410_0FEF4D50097733D8">
another lady with whom &s;he lived, unguardedly took charge of her during the journey. Before our de|parture, I reflected upon the difficulties and impro|priety of this &s;tep, and communicated my ideas to the ladies, who, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to the objections I &s;tarted, pre&s;&s;ed me to fulfil my promi&s;e: I con&s;ented, purely from principles of politene&s;s and good-nature. During the cour&s;e of our journey, &s;he un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lded to me, of her own accord, certain acts of cruelty and inju&s;tice &s;he had &s;uffered from her father, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|&s;tigation of her <HI>mother-in-law,</HI> with a &s;tory of her innocence having fallen, and her reputation having been de&s;troyed, by a connection of the lady under who&s;e charge &s;he was, and who for that rea&s;on had pre&s;&s;ed her departure with me; and added, &s;he was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted with India, that &s;he determined to quit it; and entreated me to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the accompli&s;h|ment of her wi&s;hes. I di&s;approved, in the mo&s;t un|qualified terms, of her project&mdash;gave her the be&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted advice&mdash;and, through the whole di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s which was impo&s;ed upon me, acted merely with a view to her honour and hap|pine&s;s; and &s;everal of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable people in Palamcotah, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time, and at Ma|dras, where &s;he afterwards re&s;ided, could atte&s;t the delicacy of my conduct towards her, as well as the concern and intere&s;t I took in every thing that was likely to be of advantage to her.</P>
<P>This is a fair &s;tatement of the matter; and yet, on account of it, I was mo&s;t infamou&s;ly &s;candali|zed; and the &s;candel reached even the ears of my father, whom, however, I &s;oon &s;atisfied on that head. But that which &s;tung me to the quick was the conduct of &s;ome of my own relations, (who&punc; if they even could not ju&s;tify or approve, ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lea&s;t to have been &s;ilent), in becoming the mo&s;t vi|rulent of my detractors&mdash;though, when the character of tho&s;e very relations had on former occa&s;ions been re|flected
<PB N="416" REF="031911_0411_0FEF4D5299499A30">
upon, I &s;tood up and defended them at the imminent hazard of my life. Such conduct appeared to me mo&s;t atrocious; for, whether from affection, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or pride, I always &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported my relations, if I heard them traduced in their ab&s;ence&mdash; and, when I was not able to ju&s;tify their proceedings, at lea&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the conver&s;ation. To a man who had uniformly acted &s;o, were there even no recipro|cation of family affection, mutual ju&s;tice demanded different treatment from that I experienced, which could have &s;prung only from depravity of heart, poverty of intellect, and the mo&s;t abject meanne&s;s of &s;pirit. And what is remarkable on this, as well as on other occa&s;ions, tho&s;e who had been under the great|e&s;t obligation to my father and my&s;elf, were the mo&s;t inveterate.</P>
<P>On the death of my father, looking over his papers in the pre&s;ence of the Deputy Sheriff of Argyll, and three other gentlemen, we met with a letter on the &s;ubject from the young lady's father to mine, reflecting in a gro&s;s manner on my character. I di|rectly wrote to that gentleman, explaining the whole affair, and demanding ju&s;tice to be done to my repu|tation. Upon an ecclaireci&s;&s;ement of the matter, he wrote to me a complete apology, acknowledging that he had acted on that occa&s;ion through mi&s;repre&s;en|tation, and had too ea&s;ily given credit to ill-founded reports; and &s;aying, that as the letter in que&s;tion had, by the peru&s;al of the Deputy Sheriff and other gen|tlemen, in &s;ome mea&s;ure become a matter of public notoriety, he thought it incumbent on him to make that apology, and to expre&s;s his &s;incere regret for any de|triment I might have &s;u&s;tained, by his yielding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|guardedly to a &s;udden impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, cau&s;ed, as he was then perfectly convinced, by mi&s;infor|mation.</P>
<P>Thus was my character at once cleared of a ca|lumny which the indu&s;trious villany of a few had con|trived
<PB N="417" REF="031911_0412_0FEF4D55234E8748">
to propagate through every &s;pot of the earth where I was known.</P>
<P>This &s;tory may &s;erve as an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on to you, my FREDERICK, to avoid, in the very fir&s;t in|&s;tance, any connection with women that in the proba|ble cour&s;e of things can lead to private acts of con|fidence: they are at be&s;t indi&s;creet&mdash;tend, as in this ca&s;e, to make a man a dupe&mdash;and never fail to lead to &s;candal and reproach. You will al&s;o, from the letter of the lady's father, found eight or ten years after it was written among my father's papers, &s;ee the impropriety and hazard of committing your thoughts incautiou&s;ly to paper. I have known it fre|quently, as in this in&s;tance, end in mortification and regret.</P>
<P>Before quitting entirely the Malabar coa&s;t, I took a trip to Surat, which amply repaid me for my trou|ble. It &s;urpa&s;&s;es any part of India for extent and variety of commerce, for populous &s;treets and &s;u|burbs, and for a continually moving &s;cene of opu|lence. For a more minute account of it, I refer you to the Abb&eacute; RAYNAL, who, though not generally accurate, is &s;o elegant, that you will be able, from his de&s;cription, to form a lively conception of the place, and its &s;ingular cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>Here I was received in a very friendly manner by Mr. SETON. And indeed I may now once for all de|clare, that at every place where I &s;topped, and every po&s;t I pa&s;&s;ed, from my leaving England till my re|turn, I experienced the mo&s;t kind and liberal reception, and the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous attention: my wants of every kind, whether of ve&s;&s;els, boats, guards of Sepoys, letters of introduction, &amp;c. being &s;upplied by anti|cipation, I had &s;carcely occa&s;ion to make a reque&s;t, or expre&s;s a wi&s;h; nor was the attention &s;hewn to the public &s;ervice le&s;s than that which was manife&s;ted for my private convenience. To kindne&s;s &s;o truly con|&s;olatory
<PB N="418" REF="031911_0413_0FEF4D580C07B640">
as it then was to me, I never look back with|out &s;entiments of unbounded gratitude and unfeigned acknowledgment.</P>
<P>My journeys by land in India after my &s;hipwreck, independent of long voyages by &s;ea, amounted to more than three thou&s;and miles. After getting back to Madras, my health being materially injured, I re&s;olved to return to England: but, having &s;een almo&s;t all the Company's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, I felt a curio&s;ity to &s;ee China, and determined to make that my way. To render this route more agreeable to me, Lord MACART|NEY, in addition to his other favours, gave me the following hand&s;ome letter of introduction to Mr. PIGOU, the Company's chief &s;upercargo at Canton:

<P>This letter will be delivered to you by Captain DONALD CAMPBELL, of this E&s;tabli&s;hment&mdash;a gentleman who has &s;ignalized him&s;elf on many oc|ca&s;ions, but more particularly by his ability and addre&s;s in accompli&s;hing the &s;urrender of the fort of Bidanore, at which place he had been long a pri&s;oner. His ill &s;tate of health contracted there, renders a voyage to China, perhaps to Europe, ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Should he remain any time at your Settlement, I &s;hall be much obliged to y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for any attention and civility &s;hewn to him; and I &s;hall he happy, on any occa&s;ion you may afford me, of returning your polite attention to an officer of &s;o much merit as Captain CAMPBELL, and of proving how much I am,</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="031911_0414_0FEF4D5B166E0508">I had al&s;o a letter to Mr. FREEMAN, another Su|percargo there; by whom, as well as by Mr. PIGOU, I was treated with great politene&s;s: and Mr. FREE|MAN being obliged to leave Canton, and go to Macao, for the recovery of his health, invited me to accompany him there. I availed my&s;elf of the opportu|nity; and, as we went all along through the rivers, had an opportunity of &s;eeing more of the country than many of the Europeans who vi&s;it that country. With the ob&s;ervations which I made in the cour&s;e of this excur&s;ion and my re&s;idence at Canton, I would fur|ni&s;h you, but that Lord MACARTNEY's emba&s;&s;y is ju&s;t returned from that country; and is every rea&s;on to hope that he, or &s;ome of the gentlemen who attended him, and who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uperior abilities and more ample materials, will favour the public with a much more perfect account than mine could po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>While I remained at Canton, a very di&s;agreeable rupture took place between the Factory and the Chine&s;e. An Engli&s;h &s;hip lying at Wampoa, in &s;a|luting, &s;hattered a Chine&s;e boat; by which accident, two men in it were much hurt with the &s;plinters, and one of them died of his wounds &s;oon after. The matter was clearly explained to the Mandarins; and they &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied that it was merely an acci|dent. A few days after, the Supercargo of the &s;hip was forcibly &s;eized, and carried into the city: the Council met, and determined to &s;end for the &s;ailors from the &s;hips; and in the evening after dark, fifteen or &s;ixteen boats, with four or five hundred men at|tempted, in an irregular manner, to come up to Can|ton&mdash;were fired upon by the Chine&s;e boats and forts in pa&s;&s;ing, and, with a few men wounded, were compelled to retreat. Nothing could &s;urpa&s;s the con&s;ternation and indeci&s;ion of the Council; and after the mo&s;t humiliating language, they were obliged to

appea&s;e the Chine&s;e, and &s;ettle the affair by giving up the gunner of the &s;hip to their re&s;entment.</P>
<P>On the 29th December, 1784, I embarked in the Pon&s;borne Ea&s;t-Indiaman, Captain HAMMET, in which I had come from Madras to China; and, after a tolerable voyage of five months and two days, got on board a fi&s;hing-boat off Falmouth, and was put on &s;hore there, having been exactly four years and five days from England.</P>
<P>Such was my impatience to &s;ee you, that I wrote from Falmouth for you to meet me at Bath. We arrived there the &s;ame day; and never in my life did I experience &s;uch tran&s;ports as in fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ing you to my bo&s;om: I found you all that my heart could wi&s;h; and I mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice to my opinion, aver, that not one action of your life has tended &s;ince to give me a moment's pain: on the contrary, I have every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied that my &s;anguine hopes of you will be realized. The turn of your thoughts and actions have been vigilantly watched and clo&s;ely examined by me; and from your affection to my&s;elf and your mother, your gentle deportment to my dome&s;tics, your frank|ne&s;s and candour with your brother and &s;chool-fel|lows&mdash;even from your fondne&s;s for your favourite dog <HI>Pompey,</HI> and frequent &s;ilent contemplations of the etchings of his countenance, I have drawn the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pre&s;ages of purity and innocence of heart, &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and refined honour and gene|ro&s;ity. If it plea&s;es GOD to &s;pare your life, and &s;trengthen your con&s;titution, I &s;hall &s;till be the hap|pie&s;t of men, notwith&s;tanding the inroad made upon my feelings by the hard&s;hips and afflictions I had un|dergone, of which many aro&s;e from unavoidable ac|cident, and &s;ome from malignant and unnatural per|&s;ecution, ari&s;ing from ba&s;e envy, dictated by cowardly revenge. I do not wi&s;h you to know who the wretches are: I only wi&s;h you to know that &s;uch dete&s;table

pa&s;&s;ions do exi&s;t in human nature&mdash;that, warned by their wickedne&s;s to me, you may, in your progre&s;s through life, be cautious, temperate and guarded.</P>
<P>Another thing I am anxious to impre&s;s upon the mind, particularly, of your brother JOHN, is the danger of a warm, impetuous temper. Many of the hazards and difficulties of my life aro&s;e from the pre|dominance of a fiery &s;pirit, and an ungovernable, mi&s;taken ambition. A &s;ingle in&s;tance will &s;erve to &s;hew it. When I was under the command of Captain, afterwards General MATHEWS, in his regiment of cavalry, being cantoned at a place called Tuckolam, in the neighbourhood of exten&s;ive woods, information was brought us that wild bulls infe&s;ted the neighbour|ing villages, and had killed &s;ome people: we pre|pared to enter the wood, and de&s;troy, if po&s;&s;ible, tho&s;e ferocious animals, which had become the terror and de&s;truction of the contiguous country. The origin of tho&s;e wild herds was this&mdash;From time immemorial, a religious cu&s;tom had prevailed among the Pagan in|habitants, of offering a calf to the wood upon the ac|compli&s;hment of any favourite purpo&s;e, &s;uch as the &s;afe delivery of his wife, or the obtaining an employ|ment, &amp;c. In proce&s;s of time, tho&s;e calves bred, and became numerous and incredibly fierce. Independent of protecting the defencele&s;s natives, it was in it&s;elf a mo&s;t intere&s;ting kind of hunting. The mode of doing it was this&mdash;A large party, well mounted, galloping in a body up to a great flock, and marking out the fierce&s;t champion of the whole, attacked him with &s;words and pi&s;tols. One day, a bull which was wounded, and thereby rendered more fierce, though not le&s;s vigorous, got po&s;ted in &s;ome thick bu&s;hes, in &s;uch a manner as to be approached only in front: a whim of the mo&s;t extravagant kind came into my head, &s;ugge&s;ted by vain-glory and youthful &s;ire&mdash;I thought it ungenerous for &s;o many to attack him at
<PB N="422" REF="031911_0417_0FEF4D62217E95C0">
once; and, wi&s;hing to have the credit of &s;ubduing him, I di&s;mounted from my hor&s;e, and attacked him with a pike: I &s;oon, however, had cau&s;e to repent this ra&s;h and unwarrantable &s;tep; it had nearly been fatal to me&mdash;for the bull &s;oon threw the pike into the air, and, had it not been for the very gallant ex|ertions of my brother officers, who rode in upon him, and re&s;cued me at the moment that the brute's horns had touched my coat, I mu&s;t have been killed. An Indian officer, who was in my troop, particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf at the imminent hazard of his life, the bull having to&s;&s;ed his hor&s;e and him&s;elf to a di&s;tance from his horns. At this time I was but eighteen years of age, and had not the judgment to reflect, that if I had been killed, my fate would be attended with only pity or &s;corn for my folly; whereas, had I &s;ucceeded, the whole reward of my danger would have been the u&s;ele&s;s applau&s;e of &s;ome young|&s;ters, idle and incon&s;iderate as my&s;elf&mdash;while my ra&s;hne&s;s would have been reprobated by every man who&s;e good opinion was worth enjoying. One or two people who were pre&s;ent at the time, are now living in great repute in England. We &s;ucceeded, however, in driving tho&s;e wild cattle into the interior rece&s;&s;es of the wood, dividing the fle&s;h of tho&s;e we killed among &s;uch of the poor Sepoys as would eat it, and thereby rendered e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the contigu|ous villages.</P>
<P>Often when I have heard, in coffee-hou&s;es and play-hou&s;es, &s;ome of our &s;porting &s;parks boa&s;ting of their prowe&s;s over a timid hare or a feeble fox, I could not help recollecting with re&s;pect the hunters of India, who cha&s;e the de&s;tructive mon&s;ters of the fore&s;t&mdash;the boar, the tyger, the hyena, the bull, or the buffalo; and, while they &s;teel the nerves, animate the courage, and, by habitual deeds of pith, fit them&s;elves for war, render e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to their fellow creatures, and
<PB N="423" REF="031911_0418_0FEF4CF164CF81F8">
&s;ave the lives and property of thou&s;ands. Such great|ne&s;s of &s;pirit, under the controul of good &s;en&s;e, and the direction of prudence, mu&s;t render a man re&s;pec|table&mdash;but, if not managed with di&s;cretion, leaves a man no other prai&s;e than that of a magnanimous mad|man. Take every opportunity, my dear FREDERICK, of inculcating the&s;e precepts in the mind of your bro|ther: the natural warmth of his temper often makes me fearful of the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences which I have my&s;elf too often experienced&mdash;though, I thank GOD, it never &s;timulated me to revenge, or to a pre|meditated intention of injuring any one.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid more than once, that I have a mo&s;t perfect conviction your amiable di&s;po&s;ition will en&s;ure to you the love of mankind; but it will at the &s;ame time &s;ubject you to many impo&s;itions&mdash;to guard again&s;t which, a great &s;hare of &s;ternne&s;s is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary: there is, be&s;ides, a certain degree of for|titude ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to give lu&s;tre to a gentle di&s;po&s;ition; without it, meekne&s;s is thought timidity &mdash;mode&s;ty, weakne&s;s&mdash;and the charming mildne&s;s of the forgiving heart, abu&s;ed as the pitiful re&s;ource of abject apprehen&s;ion and a mean &s;pirit. There are times, therefore, when the wickedne&s;s of men, and the cu&s;toms of the world, make it nece&s;&s;ary to lay a&s;ide the lamb, and a&s;&s;ume the lion. EUROPE at this moment pre&s;ents an awful and alarming cri&s;is. In a neighbouring country, the conduct of the higher cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety has produced a dreadful convul&s;ion: &s;ocial order has been &s;ubverted, and the &s;tability of property annihilated: all rea&s;oning from the hi&s;tory of former times is found inapplicable to the pre&s;ent: the &s;y&s;tem of warfare it&s;elf has undergone a revolution; and no man is able to &s;ay from po&s;itive inference, "Thus will it be to-morrow." Our in&s;ular &s;ituation, thank GOD! protects us: and the precarious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ooting upon which civil order and proper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;tand in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> countries on the continent, make our &s;tate in England enviable.
<PB N="424" REF="031911_0419_0FEF4D63B01A83A0">
The time is neverthele&s;s pregnant with extraordinary event; and you are now approaching that age at which men &s;hould be ready to act at the call of their country. It is therefore &s;itting for you to make &s;uch things the &s;ubject of frequent contemplation&mdash;to habi|tuate your mind to the meeting of danger, &s;o as to be ready, at a moment's warning, to lay down your life, if nece&s;&s;ary, for the good of your country; for, after all, my FREDERICK, what avails it whether we die in this way or in that?&mdash;to die with honour and a good con&s;cience, is all. Let prejudice be laid a&s;ide &mdash;and who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of common &s;en&s;e, could he&s;itate a moment to prefer death in the field, to death with the loath&s;ome aggravation of &s;ickne&s;s, the crocodile tears of pretended friends, and the painful emotions and lamentations of tho&s;e who really love us?</P>
<P>Finally, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that at the time I left India, the affairs of the Briti&s;h Nation wore &s;o very lower|ing an a&s;pect, all per&s;ons acquainted with our con|cerns there, allowed nothing but a long &s;eries of wi&s;e mea&s;ures, with the be&s;t efficient &s;ervants to execute them, could re&s;cue the company from ruin. I am happy in being able now to &s;tate, without the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of contradiction, that the clouds which menaced us in that quarter have &s;ince been gradually di&s;&s;ipating beneath the mea&s;ures of the BOARD of CONTROUL, under the direction of Mr. DUNDAS; and are at la&s;t entirely di&s;per&s;ed by the glorious admini&s;tration of Lord CORNWALLIS, who&s;e wi&s;dom in the cabinet tended no le&s;s to the &s;ecurity, than his military talents, ju&s;tice and moderation, to the honour, of GREAT BRITAIN in the Ea&s;t. The choice of &s;uch a per&s;on for the government of India, reflects credit on HIS MAJESTY's Councils, and evinces that the paternal care and &s;olicitude of our amiable SOVEREIGN extend to the mo&s;t remote part of the Empire.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>HONOURABLE SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour of informing you of the &s;ucce&s;s of your arms on the Malabar coa&s;t. You will have received ad|vices of the out&s;et of the expedition from Bombay, and the gene|ral purport of it. On the 12th of December, I failed with a &s;mall party; and thought proper, of my own accord, to land at Ra|jamundroog, in preference to any other place&mdash;becau&s;e, on this part of the coa&s;t, I had the double advantage of being able to &s;e|cure my&s;elf until reinforced, and to procure provi&s;ions, which I could not have done at Cundapore, or any place to the South|ward, by rea&s;on of the numerous garri&s;ons, and the vicinity of them to the capital. The mea&s;ures and di&s;po&s;itions of the gentle|men at Bombay were &s;uch, that I could not place any dependence upon being timely reinforced from thence, or of having my &s;up|ply of provi&s;ions. Rajamundroog is on the top of a high hill, and commands the entrance of the be&s;t river on the coa&s;t. We took it by &s;torm. The moment we landed, a &s;hort time was taken up in preparing to move towards Onore; for we had not a cooly, carriage, or bullock, to convey any &s;tores. The battering can|non, ammunition, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. were &s;ent by &s;ea; and the great additions that HYDER had made to the fortifications of Onore and fortified I&s;land, prevented my entering the river with
<PB N="2" REF="031911_0421_0FEF4CEB42A7C770">
the &s;mall craft, and obliged me to land every thing through a heavy &s;urf on the beach, and then to cro&s;s the river to the North|ward of the fort. The&s;e impediments were got over; and a practicable breach being effected, the a&s;&s;ault was made&mdash;and the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of two thou&s;and five hundred men, were either killed, drowned, or made pri&s;oners.&mdash;Shortly after this event, the troops from the Southward, under Lieutenant Colonel MACLEOD, were landed at Rajamundroog. To wait for a junc|tion, would take up much time: &s;o, that not a moment &s;hould be lo&s;t, I embarked, and landed near Cundapore, under the fire of the Bombay Grab and the Intrepid, and immediately &s;eized a &s;mall fort that &s;erved to &s;ecure our &s;tores. The enemy were in fight, and &s;eemed numerous: &s;ome pri&s;oners that we took, reckoned them at twelve hundred hor&s;e, one thou&s;and Sepoys, and five hundred Peons. My party was compo&s;ed of three hun|dred and fifty Europeans, &s;ix hundred Sepoys, and four &s;mall field-pieces&mdash;with which I marched, fir&s;t towards the enemy, who drew back, and then I proceeded to Cundapore. They in|commoded my rear very much; but being determined to attack the fort, I only acted on the defen&s;ive, and at &s;even in the even|ing got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort, and the &s;everal redoubts that com|manded the river. The grand object of the expedition, an at|tack upon Bidanore, remained to be undertaken; and much &s;e|rious reflection it required before the hazardous enterprize &s;hould be determined on.&mdash;Your Honours will now take a view of the &s;tate of my army: No carriage-bullock, and the few draft not able to draw eight light field-pieces&mdash;not a cooly to carry mu&s;|quet, ammunition or provi&s;ions&mdash;not a tent&mdash;and many officers, His MAJESTY's in particular, had not a &s;ingle &s;ervant&mdash;neither bullock or &s;heep to be had, the enemy having drove them off. The army, at this time, con&s;i&s;ted of about e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">even hundred effec|tive Europeans, and three thou&s;and Sepoys. The di&s;tance from Cundapore to the foot of the Ghaut is thirty miles, through a woody country: the enemy's army had been reinforced, and lay in the way. The reports of the &s;trength of the various works that defended the pa&s;s up the mountains, was &s;uch as gave me but very faint hope of &s;ucce&s;s; and the difficulty of &s;upplying my troops with rice, was almo&s;t of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to deter a per&s;on from the attempt. However, having po&s;itive orders to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bidanore, I re&s;olved to make a trial, and i&s;&s;ued direc|tions for the march. We had not gone &s;ix miles, before the enemy oppo&s;ed us in force. We pu&s;hed forwards; and, by the effect of well &s;erved artillery, and the &s;teadine&s;s of the men, the enemy retired as we advanced. The &s;kirmi&s;h continued about three hours&mdash;after which we were left to pur&s;ue our route un|mole&s;ted; nor did the enemy make any &s;tand till we were on the fourth day's march, within three miles of the pa&s;s&mdash;where,
<PB N="3" REF="031911_0422_0FEF4D67E9DAFF10">
the ground being favourable, they attempted oppo&s;ition, and were roughly treated, lo&s;ing, by the bayonet and &s;hot, above three hundred men. They were pur&s;ued to a &s;mall fort, which was immediately abandoned; and then fled to the fir&s;t barrier or entrance of the pa&s;s. This was a line of ma&s;onry that covered all the open ground, and was clo&s;ed by woods to the right and left. Upon &s;ix ba&s;tions were mounted fifteen pieces of cannon; and on the left was a work on a &s;teep mountain fifteen pieces of cannon; and on the left was a work on a &s;teep mountain, with two twelve pounders. This altogether had too formidable an appearance to attack in front; but having reconnoitred the right, I imagined that the flank might be turned by a&s;cending the hill through the wood. Early in the morning, two parties were formed&mdash;one to attempt the flank, the other to e&s;calade the wall; but the enemy &s;aved us that trouble by evacuating the place. This was a happy moment to try the pa&s;s; for the enemy, by felling trees, &amp;c. would have thrown &s;o many ob&s;tacles in the way, that the want of provi&s;ion would have compelled me to relinqui&s;h the de&s;ign. A party was in&s;tantly ordered to follow the enemy up the hill, which, with little lo&s;s, gained the &s;econd barrier, on which were mounted eleven guns. Fifty of the enemy were killed or taken at this work. Having this &s;ucce&s;s, I relieved the exhau&s;ted by fre&s;h detachments, which excited emulation, and encouraged the ardour of the Sepoys; for, to the unremitting exertions of this branch of your troops is due the honour of this day. Battery after battery was taken; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort on the top of the Ghaut, about five in the afternoon, called Hyderghur, crowned the whole. At this fort we found mounted thirty pieces of cannon, from twenty-four to four pounders; and at the different works in the pa&s;s, forty others, from four to twelve.</P>
<P>When we contemplated the numerous redoubts and the height of the Ghaut, and were told by pri&s;oners that we had drove off &s;eventeen thou&s;and men, including di&s;mounted cavalry, regular Sepoys, and match-lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k Peons, we could not con&s;ider the vic|tory we had gained as due to us&mdash;our weak efforts would have been in vain. The progre&s;s of your arms is to be a&s;cribed to the Divine will. In the cour&s;e of this war, Providence has been peculiarly bountiful&mdash;When we were in want of rice, we were &s;ure to find a &s;upply left for our u&s;e by the enemy&mdash;when our mu&s;quet-ammunition was expended, the enemy's magazines fur|ni&s;hed us abundantly&mdash;cannon we found in every fort, and &s;uch quantities of warlike &s;tores, that we are apt to &s;uppo&s;e that HYDER &s;upplied all his garri&s;ons from this coa&s;t and from Bidanore. Hyderghur is about fourteen miles from Hydern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gur, <HI>alias</HI> Bidanore, the capital of the Province.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="031911_0423_0FEF4D6C063A9AC0">In the night of the day that we gained the Ghaut, I was vi&s;ited by Captain DONALD CAMPBELL, the &s;on of Colonel CHARLES CAMPBELL. He had been wrecked off the coa&s;t, was &s;eized, and kept in irons, until the approach of this army cau&s;ed the Jemadar to relea&s;e him, to employ him as an Amba&s;&s;ador. His me&s;&s;age was, that the Jemadar having lo&s;t his Ma&s;ter (HYDER), and being upon bad terms with TIPPOO SAHIB, would willing|ly put him&s;elf under the protection of the Company, provided that the management of the country was continued to him. The idea of getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital and the forts of the king|dom towards Seringapatam, as well as the very great advantage I might expect from his experience, abilities and influence, with the weak &s;tate of my army, induced me to clo&s;e with the pro|po&s;al; and I &s;ent him a cowl, &s;ignifying that his power and in|fluence &s;hould not be le&s;&s;ened. This, tho' not drawn with a pen of a lawyer, was equal in value to the capital of Bidanore. Cap|tain CAMPBELL returned with it, and was to tell the Jemadar that I &s;hould march in the morning.</P>
<P>Not expecting the great &s;ucce&s;s that we had met with by forcing the pa&s;s on the main road, I had detached Lieutenant-Colonel MACLEOD to the left to a&s;cend the Ghaut through a nar|row path, in order to attack Hyderghur in the rear. The ab|&s;ence of this detachment, and the fatigue of the former day, re|duced my party to about four hundred Europeans and &s;even hundred Sepoys; and all my guns were at the bottom of the Ghaut. With this detachment I moved towards Bidanore, and was within a mile of the walls before any me&s;&s;age came from Captain CAMPBELL or the Jemadar: but having nothing to ap|prehend in the field from the panic-&s;truck enemy, we continued our march until the welcome approach of Captain CAMPBELL a&s;&s;ured me the place was our own. On entering it, I was plea&s;ed to &s;ee about four hundred of your Sepoys that had been taken in the Carnatic, who offered me their &s;ervice. Upon vi&s;iting the Jemadar, I repeated my a&s;&s;urances, that while he behaved faithfully to the Company, the management of the country &s;hould be continued to him; and, although the &s;word mu&s;t be in your hands, that he &s;hould have as much power and influence as his &s;tation required, and that you would not refu&s;e &s;ettling upon him very ample allowances. The enemy being in force, and my army much weakened, with other di&s;agreeable matters that oc|curred, prevented my further advance than to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two forts to the Ea&s;tward; for, being apprehen&s;ive that the Kil|lidar of Mangalore would not deliver up that place to the order of HYAT SAHIB, and con&s;idering that famous &s;ea-port of more con&s;equence to your affairs than acquiring territory beyond the mountains, I held my&s;elf in readine&s;s to march that way, and was forced to lay &s;iege to it. A practicable breach being made,
<PB N="5" REF="031911_0424_0FEF4CD7A5EA0E00">
the Killidar thought proper to &s;urrender it. Upon this happy event give me leave to congratulate you; for it partly &s;ecures our conque&s;ts from Carwar to Cananore. There are two or three places that I have not been able to &s;ummons; but as the&s;e gar|ri&s;ons cannot expect any &s;uccour, they will fall of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus have I given your honours a &s;hort recital, from the fir&s;t landing of your arms on the 12th of December, to the reduction of Mangalore on the 9th of March; in which &s;hort time a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;s has attended us that can hardly be paralleled. All the enemy's marine has fallen in our hands, among which are eight &s;hips of the line, either built or on the &s;tocks; and five of them might be &s;ent to &s;ea in a &s;hort time. After informing you of the happy and glorious &s;ucce&s;s of your arms, it is painful for me to tell you, that di&s;&s;ention in the army, on account of plunder and booty, has ari&s;en to &s;uch a height as to threaten open mutiny. I have informed your Honours of the terms that the Jemadar re|quired, and that I in your name granted; and you know in how peaceable a manner this capital was re&s;igned to you. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that HIS MAJESTY's officers have been foremo&s;t in the clamours; and that the agents appointed by them have occa|&s;ioned me much trouble and anxiety, and a great deal of di&s;con|tent throughout the army. I &s;hall &s;end you copies of the &s;everal letters that have pa&s;&s;ed, for your determination, They may &s;up|po&s;e that I have appropriated trea&s;ure to my own u&s;e, or bar|gained to re&s;tore the private property of the Jemadar to him; or that I &s;hould agree that he &s;hould call all trea&s;ure and jewels his private property, to the exclu&s;ion of what of right &s;hould belong to the Honourable Company or the captors. I have only to a&s;&s;ure your Honours, that I have made no bargain whatever, either public or private, but what was expre&s;&s;ed in the cowl &s;ent from Hyderghur, to which Captain CAMPBELL was witne&s;s; and as I have frequently mentioned to my friends, that I would not re|ceive a pre&s;ent of con&s;equence without the con&s;ent of the Honour|able Company, I &s;hall inform you, that on my fir&s;t vi&s;it the Jema|dar in&s;i&s;ted on making me a pre&s;ent of a lack of rupees; and when he plea&s;ed to give a donation to the army of two lacks and thirty thou&s;and of rupees, which &s;um waits your plea&s;ure, he re|que&s;ted I would accept of another lack of rupees. To both of the&s;e reque&s;ts re&s;pecting my&s;elf, I replied, that provided your Ho|nours would give me leave, I &s;hould certainly embrace that for|tunate moment to gain an independence, and &s;hall wait your or|ders as to the di&s;po&s;al of two lacks of rupees. How far my for|mer and the pre&s;ent &s;ervices may entitle me to your good opinion, and to your acquie&s;cence in thus rewarding me, is left to the genero&s;ity of your Honours; but I beg that you will believe, that, during the cour&s;e of my &s;ervices, every thing of a &s;imilar nature &s;hall be laid before you.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031911_0425_0FEF4D70615FD2C0">If it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;atisfy the avidity of a body of men, this little army would have a &s;ufficiency of honour and profit to fill the mo&s;t greedy; but the infirmities of nature are not to be con|trouled by rea&s;on. Avarice of the mo&s;t pernicious tendency has pervaded the limits of &s;en&s;e, and &s;tepped beyond the bounds of duty. The army, not content with acquiring, at the different places that has been taken on the coa&s;t in &s;hips of war, naval &s;tores, merchandize, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in goods of various kinds at Bidanore, which altogether the Jemadar &s;ays may be valued at thirty lacks of pagodas; they &s;eek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o deprive the Jemadar of his private property, under pretence of the lawful rights of war; and a&s;&s;ume a &s;tyle and manner in their clamours and united ad|dre&s;&s;es, that appears intended to force from me what I think ought to be pre&s;erved for the public &s;ervice, and for the benefit of the Honourable Company. The manner that the fort and city was delivered to the Company, does not authorize me to touch private property; and the cowl implies a perfect &s;ecurity for all &s;uch. Would your honours be plea&s;ed, that by any ra|pacious action of your Commander in Chief, that he or the troops &s;hould forfeit the good opinion that may be entertained of them from their rapid &s;ucce&s;s, or that the public &s;ervice &s;hould be con&s;idered as a &s;econdary object? Our name has fallen almo&s;t to contempt; but, as far as lays in my power, it &s;hall be recovered, if not rai&s;ed to its former eminence.</P>
