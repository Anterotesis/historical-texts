<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH they who are departed hence in the Lord, can receive no ad|dition to their happine&s;s by any te&s;timonial of their &s;urviving friends, however ju&s;t; yet to the wi&s;e in heart, precious is the memory of the truly pious and upright, who&s;e hum|ble walking in the fear of God has livingly witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t the appearance of evil in its various transformations; their confor|mity in &s;pirit and practice to the holy law of the Lord, evincing the delight and be|nefit to be found therein; for
<Q>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</Q>
P&s;alm lviii, ver&s;e 11.</P>
<P><Q>What &s;cene in this life more dignifies humanity? what &s;chool is more profita|bly in&s;tructive than the death-bed of the righteous, impre&s;&s;ing the under&s;tanding with a convincing evidence, that they have not followed cunningly devi&s;ed fa|bles, but &s;olid &s;ub&s;tantial truth; that there is a mea&s;ure of divine light and grace in man, which if duly minded and obeyed, is &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve thro' all the vici&s;&s;itudes in life, to give him the vic|tory

over his &s;piritual enemies, and in the end over death, hell, and the grave?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of James Gough, page 53.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>It is right therefore, that the remembrance of tho&s;e &s;hould be pre&s;erved, who&s;e lights have &s;o &s;hone before men as to excite the beholders of their good works to glorify God, the original, and &s;ource from whom all good is derived, that tho' being dead, the lu&s;tre of their pious example through life, and on the approach of death, may con|tinue to &s;peak the inviting language,
<Q>Fol|low us as we have followed Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>With this view, our yearly-meeting con|&s;idering that many memorials of our depart|ed friends lay dormant on the records, di|rected a Collection to be made of &s;uch of them as were mo&s;t likely to be of general benefit by publication, which the committee appointed for the &s;ervice having performed to the be&s;t of their judgment, it is now pre|&s;ented to the readers, &s;ome of whom will be reminded of the &s;incere piety and virtue of their ance&s;tors, who through the dangers and difficulties to which they were &s;ubjected, in their removal from their native land, and forming a new &s;ettlement in a wilderne&s;s, were happily pre&s;erved in a &s;teady attention to their religious duty, and many of them faithfully engaged in promoting the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s among mankind, to whom others &s;ucceeded, who through obedience to the powerful influence of Di|vine grace, became alike eminent in their day, and &s;erviceable in the church.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="020377_0004_0FAF095D73C33498">The following Collection is affectionately recommended to the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e worthies, to the readers in general, and particularly to the youth, who may derive profitable in&s;truction by a &s;erious ob&s;erva|tion of the happy effects of an early devoti|on of heart, and the inexpre&s;&s;ible advant|ages of embracing the merciful vi&s;itation of the Mo&s;t-High, to &s;ecure their true comfort in this life, and enduring felicity in that which is to come.</P>
<P>Though the language and &s;tyle of the&s;e memorials may not be calculated to plea&s;e &s;uch curious readers who in their e&s;timate of the value of a Book, are too much amu&s;|ed by the di&s;play of wit and literary accom|pli&s;hments in the compo&s;ition, to give due attention to the in&s;tructive import of an art|le&s;s account of the chri&s;tian experiences of tho&s;e, who have not been &s;o &s;olicitous for the approbation of men, as to be found humble followers of Chri&s;t, their meek and lowly pattern and redeemer; but it is hop|ed, that there are many to whom the con|tents of this Collection will afford informa|tion, edification, and encouragement in the pur&s;uit of their mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;t, a life of true wi&s;dom, piety, and virtue; and that the number of &s;uch may increa&s;e is the de&s;ign of the following publication.</P>

<P>HE was born at Ea&s;ington, in Bolland in the county of York, in Old England, and was one of the worthies in I&s;rael. My &s;pirit is comforted in a &s;en&s;e of that power, which did attend him in our meetings, for many years in the land of our nativity, and al&s;o after he came into the&s;e parts; having been a valiant &s;oldier for the truth, and bore a faithful te&s;timony to the &s;ame, in

word, life and conver&s;ation. He went through many great exerci&s;es and impri&s;onments, and was a comfort unto the faithful and true believers, who <HI>follow the Lamb through many tribulations.</HI> He was a worthy in&s;tru|ment in the Lord's hand, again&s;t the fal&s;e teachers and hirelings, going &s;everal times to their &s;teeple-hou&s;es, and te&s;tifying again&s;t their deceiving the people. He al&s;o went to &s;everal market towns, and at their cro&s;&s;es, declared and publi&s;hed the truth as it is in Je&s;us: I accompanied him and his dear wife at one of them, where he faithfully warned the people and exhorted them to repentance; the divine power and pre&s;ence eminently at|tending him, which my &s;oul was made &s;en|&s;ible of to my comfort and &s;atisfaction. I can &s;ay he was of great &s;ervice to me and many others, being in&s;trumental in bring|ing us near unto the Lord, who&s;e name over all we have cau&s;e to ble&s;s on his behalf; and although his body is gone to the earth, his memorial liveth among the righteous, and I am per&s;uaded his &s;oul is in the enjoyment of peace with the Lord. I was often with him in the time of his &s;ick|ne&s;s, and beheld his meek, innocent and lamb-like deportment; being al&s;o by his bed-&s;ide when he departed, which was in a quiet and truly re&s;igned frame, like one fall|ing into a &s;weet &s;leep; &s;o that I have great cau&s;e to believe he is one of tho&s;e <HI>that died in the Lord, and is at re&s;t with him forever.</HI></P>

<P>HE was one of the Lord's worthies, &s;trong and &s;teadfa&s;t in the faith, very zealous for the truth and careful for the church; his life being hid with God in Chri&s;t.

In a word, he was a Jew inward who&s;e prai&s;e is not of men but of God.

<P>THE love of God to him was great, in calling him out of the broad way to labour in his vineyard; and tho' it was late in the day, I believe he received his penny.

However, in an unexpected time, way was made for our getting into a &s;mall bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;uited our capacities, and the Lord gave a ble&s;&s;ing unto our endeavours.

<HEAD>A Te&s;timony from the Monthly-Meeting of <HI>Haverford</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> concerning THOMAS LLOYD.</HEAD>
<P>THE love of God and the regard we have to the ble&s;&s;ed truth, con&s;trains us to give forth this te&s;timony, concerning our dear friend Thomas Lloyd, many of us having had long acquaintance with him, both in Wales, where he formerly lived, and al&s;o in Penn&s;ylvania, where he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, and laid down his head in peace with the Lord, and is at re&s;t and joy with him for|evermore.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="020377_0029_0FAF09764B903868">He was by birth of them who are called the gentry, his father being a man of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate and of great e&s;teem in his time, of an ancient hou&s;e and e&s;tate called Dolobran, in Montgomery&s;hire in Wales. He was brought up at the mo&s;t noted &s;chools, and from thence went to one of the univer&s;ities; and becau&s;e of his &s;u|perior, natural and acquired parts, many of account in the world had an eye of re|gard towards him: Being offered degrees and places of preferments, he refu&s;ed them all: The Lord beginning his work in him, and cau&s;ing a mea&s;ure of his light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, in his heart, which gave him a &s;ight of the vain forms, cu&s;toms and tra|ditions of the &s;chools and colleges: And hearing of a poor de&s;pi&s;ed people called Quakers, he went to hear them, and the Lord's power reached unto him and came over him, to the humbling and bowing his heart and &s;pirit; &s;o that he was convinced of God's everla&s;ting truth, and received it in the love of it, and was made willing, like meek Mo&s;es, to choo&s;e rather to &s;uffer affliction with the people of the Lord, than the honours, preferments and riches of this world. The earthly wi&s;dom came to be of no reputation with him, but he became a fool, both to it and his former a&s;&s;ociates, and through &s;elf denial, and taking up the daily cro&s;s of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which crucified his natural will, affections and plea&s;ures, he came to be a &s;cholar in Chri&s;t's &s;chool,
<PB N="23" REF="020377_0030_0FAF0976F0395E10">
and to learn the true wi&s;dom which is from above. Thus by departing from the vani|ties and iniquities of the world, and follow|ing the leadings, guidance and in&s;tructions of the divine light, grace and &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he came more and more to have an under&s;tanding in the my&s;teries of God's kingdom, and was made an able mini&s;ter of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel of peace and &s;alvation; his acquired parts being &s;anctified to the &s;ervice of truth.</P>
<P>His &s;ound and effectual mini&s;try, his godly conver&s;ation, meek and lamb-like &s;pirit, great patience, temperance, humility, and &s;lowne&s;s to wrath; his love to the bre|thren, his godly care in the church of Chri&s;t, that all things might be kept &s;weet, &s;avoury and in good order; his helping hand to the weak, and gentle admonitions, we are fully &s;atisfied have a &s;eal and witne&s;s in the hearts of all faithful friends who knew him, both in the land of his nativity and in the&s;e American parts. We may in truth &s;ay, he &s;ought not him&s;elf, nor the riches of this world, but his eye was to that which is everla&s;ting, being given up to &s;pend and be &s;pent for the truth and the &s;ake of friends.</P>
<P>He never turned his back on the truth, nor was weary in his travels Sion-wards, but remained a &s;ound pillar in the &s;piritual building. He had many di&s;putes with the clergy and &s;ome called peers in England, and al&s;o &s;uffered impri&s;onments and much lo&s;s of outward &s;ub&s;tance, to the honour of

truth, and &s;topping in mea&s;ure, the mouths of gain&s;ayers and per&s;ecutors. Yet the&s;e ex|erci&s;es and trials in the land of his nativity, which he &s;u&s;tained through the ability God gave him, were &s;mall and not to be com|pared to the many and great exerci&s;es, griefs and &s;orrows he met withal and went thro' in Penn&s;ylvania, from that mi&s;erable apo|&s;tate George Keith and his deluded compa|ny. Oh the revilings, the great provocati|ons, the bitter and wicked language, and rude behaviour which the Lord gave him patience to bear and overcome. He reviled not again, nor took any advantage, but loved his enemies, and prayed for them that de&s;pitefully abu&s;ed him. His love to the Lord, his truth and people was &s;incere to the la&s;t. He was taken with a malignant fever, the 5<HI>th</HI> of the &s;eventh month 1694, and tho' his bodily pain was great, he bore it with much patience. Not long before his departure, &s;ome friends being with him, he &s;aid,
<Q>Friends, I love you all, I am go|ing from you, and I die in unity and love with all faithful friends: I have fought a good fight and kept the faith, which &s;tands not in the wi&s;dom of words, but in the power of God: I have fought, not for &s;trife and contention, but for the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel. I lay down my head in peace and de&s;ire you may all do &s;o; friends, farewell all.</Q>

On the 10<HI>th</HI> day of the &s;eventh month afore&s;aid, being the 6<HI>th</HI> day of his &s;ick|ne&s;s, it plea&s;ed the Lord to remove him from the many trials, temptations, &s;orrows and troubles of this world, to the kingdom of ever|la&s;ting joy and peace; but the remembrance of his innocent life and meek &s;pirit lives with us, and his memorial is, and will remain to be &s;weet and comfortable to the faithful.</P>

He was not forward to offer his gift, having a true regard to the giver, who &s;aid formerly, "Ca&s;t the net on the right &s;ide of the &s;hip:" Therefore his "Bow abode in &s;trength." And tho' the Lord had furni&s;hed him with &s;uch excellent qualifications, he had &s;o learned &s;elf-denial as not to glory therein; but was ready to prefer his friends before him&s;elf, and give them the right hand of fellow&s;hip; being careful to keep the te&s;timony of truth clear on all accounts, &s;aying, "Tho&s;e that ap|pear in public, are doubly bound &s;o to do." He was of a cheerful and peaceable temper, and innocent and blamele&s;s in life. As the Lord had be&s;towed on him a gift of the mini&s;try, beyond many of his fellows, &s;o he was careful to improve it to his honour and the comfort of his people, labouring therein, not only here in Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey, but he al&s;o &s;everal times vi&s;it|ed the churches in New-England, Rhode-I&s;land, Long-I&s;land and Maryland, and la&s;tly he went on that &s;ervice to Old-En|gland, where he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e.

I have been faithful in my day, and I have nothing that troubles my &s;pirit; my &s;pirit is very clear.</Q>
He al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed his concern for his brethren of the mini&s;try, e&s;pecially the young, that they might ob&s;erve the leadings of God's &s;pirit in their mini&s;try, and not lean upon their own natural parts. After this, he re|covered

<P>ELLIS PUGH was born in the pari&s;h of Dolgelly, in the county of Merion|eth, and dominion of Wales, in the &s;ixth month 1656. His parents were religious people; but his father died before he was born, and his mother a few days after. In the days of his youth, when going with the multitude into folly, it plea&s;ed God by his judgment, to &s;tand in his way, and cau&s;ed him to con&s;ider the things that be|longed to his &s;oul's everla&s;ting peace. And in the eighteenth year of his age, the Lord vi&s;ited him more eminently, kindling a zeal in him to &s;erve his Creator more diligently; having been al&s;o reached by the te&s;timony of John-ap-John, one of the people called Quakers.</P>
<P>God who promi&s;ed to be a father to the fatherle&s;s, took care of him; and about the year 1680, gave him a part in the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, (notwith&s;tanding he was not one of the wi&s;e of this world, nor had human learning) yet he was made a profitable in&s;trument to turn divers from vanity, and to exhort and &s;trengthen many

<P>In the year 1686, he and his family, with divers of his acquaintance prepared to come over to Penn&s;ylvania, and whil&s;t they wait|ed for the &s;hip to be ready, there came great trouble and exerci&s;e upon him, &s;o that he was &s;ick for &s;ome days; in which &s;trait the Lord &s;hewed him, that they &s;hould meet with troubles and exerci&s;es in their way, and that he had a work for him in that country, and mu&s;t return again to his native land.

He ruled his own hou&s;e well, having his children in &s;ubjection: Diligent in attending meet|ings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, altho' for many years with difficulty, the country be|ing new and roads not made; but after|wards he, with con&s;iderable co&s;t and labour, got bridges erected over &s;ome creeks and a public road made near his own hou&s;e. His hou&s;e and heart were open to entertain friends according to his ability; was zeal|ou&s;ly concerned for the honour of God and promotion of truth. He often lamented that as the country grew older the people grew wor&s;e, and had corrupted the natives in their morals, teaching them bad words and the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong drink, which he, during many years in the latter part of his time, for example's &s;ake took none of, and frequently admoni&s;hed &s;uch as were in the u&s;e thereof, to ob&s;erve great temperance.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t in health, the Lord gave him a &s;en&s;e that his departure drew near; &s;oon af|terwards he was taken with the pleuri&s;y and lay about eight days, during which time he gave much good advice to his family, friends and neighbours that came to &s;ee him, to whom he al&s;o gave evident proofs of a happy exit. The day before his departure, many friends and neighbours came and had a religious meeting, after which, &s;everal taking leave, he &s;aid,
<Q>I am glad of this vi&s;it and of the meeting, but I have a great concern on my mind for this gene|ration,</Q>
mentioning many growing evils then prevalent, and &s;aid,
<Q>Many of the elders are called away and more mu&s;t &s;oon; but I hope the Lord will rai&s;e up &s;ome that &s;hall be faithful and zealous.</Q>
The evening of his decea&s;e, he took his &s;olemn leave of all pre&s;ent, beginning with his wife, and afterwards his children in order, giving each &s;omething in charge; to one particular|ly he &s;aid,

made her a &s;ingular in&s;trument of good, and a ble&s;&s;ing to her father's family. As &s;he grew in years, her con&s;picuous virtues, join|ed with a courteous deportment, ju&s;tly gain|ed the e&s;teem and favour of mo&s;t if not all with whom &s;he conver&s;ed.

"That he never u&s;ed to her an expre&s;&s;ion of anger, or the product of a di&s;turbed mind." The decea&s;e of her &s;aid hu&s;band proved to her a time of deep probation, having been heard to &s;ay, that in eight weeks time &s;he lo&s;t eight of her family by death, beginning with the decea&s;e of her beloved hu&s;band, and ending with that of her only child: Under which afflict|ing circum&s;tances, as well as what attend|ed her the remaining part of her life (of which &s;he had a large &s;hare) &s;he approved her&s;elf a &s;hining example of patience in tribulation, and a meek, humble, &s;elf-de|nying follower of Chri&s;t.</P>

She was a true &s;ervant of the church, and in the &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tle's ex|pre&s;&s;ions, "One that wa&s;hed the &s;aints feet," receiving with joy into her hou&s;e, the mi|ni&s;ters and me&s;&s;engers of the go&s;pel, for whom her love was great: The low, the poor and the mean, were objects of her pe|culiar care.</P>
<P>In her younger years &s;he received a gift in the mini&s;try, which &s;he retained with faithfulne&s;s to the end; and tho' not large in her appearance, yet with great mode&s;ty and &s;oundne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, "Her doctrine drop|ped as the dew, and di&s;tilled as the &s;mall rain," and was therefore truly acceptable. She travelled in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel, to New-England and divers other parts of this con|tinent, and was al&s;o concern'd for the good order and di&s;cipline of the church, having for a number of years, &s;erved in the &s;tation of clerk of the women's monthly, quarterly and yearly meetings, wherein &s;he gave &s;ati&s;|faction.</P>
<P>Although bodily weakne&s;s frequently at|tended her in the latter years of her life, it did not abate her love and zeal for the ever|la&s;ting truth, which &s;he experienced to be her &s;upport in every time of trial; and when her di&s;&s;olution drew near, &s;he made divers

This was her happy ex|perience; and after a well-&s;pent life, inter|&s;per&s;ed with a variety of exerci&s;ing vici&s;i|tudes, &s;he exchanged this &s;tate of exi&s;tence (no doubt) for a ble&s;&s;ed immortality in the regions of unmixed felicity; after about three weeks illne&s;s, on the 25<HI>th</HI> of the twelfth month 1726-7, in the &s;ixty-fir&s;t year of her age.

However &s;he continued &s;ome|what zealous in her way &s;till, and would be often arguing with me in vindication thereof, much about twelve months; but at one time, when &s;he was at their wor|&s;hip, the Prie&s;t denounced his excommu|nication again&s;t me, and &s;he being in a &s;eat ju&s;t under him, it came &s;o near her that &s;he was nigh to faint away; when their wor&s;hip was over, &s;he went to the Prie&s;t and &s;poke &s;omewhat home to him, and that &s;he thought &s;he de&s;erved more civility, at lea&s;t &s;o much as to know afore|hand of their excommunication, for he

<P>HE was born (as we are informed) at Folk&s;tone in Kent, Old England, the 30<HI>th</HI> of the fourth month 1690, of believ|ing parents; and came into America about the year 1720, living &s;ome time near Phila|delphia, and in 1728, removed within the limits of Ea&s;t Nottingham particular meet|ing. After his coming to this country, he was called to the work of the mini&s;try, wherein he was not forward, yet his appear|ances being lively and edifying, friends had near unity therewith. A good example in attending meetings, a faithful labourer therein, and careful in keeping to the hour appointed. He was indu&s;trious in outward affairs, tho' cheerfully given up to an&s;wer the requirings of truth; vi&s;iting the meet|ings of friends in Penn&s;ylvania, as al&s;o in New-Jer&s;ey and Maryland generally. He was gifted in di&s;cipline, and likewi&s;e quali|fied for the &s;ervice of vi&s;iting families, wherein he was engaged the la&s;t time he was ab&s;ent from home, within the limits of Bu&s;h-River and Deer-Creek particular meet|ings;

in his return from whence, he told a friend,
<Q>There was an unu&s;ual weight over his &s;pirit, and a cloud that he could not &s;ee beyond, which made him think his days work was nearly over.</Q>
The night he return'd home, he was affected with &s;ickne&s;s and much pain, which con|tinued &s;everal days, bearing the &s;ame with exemplary patience. Afterwards growing weaker but remaining &s;en&s;ible, he often ex|pre&s;&s;ed,
<Q>He had done with the world, and was willing to leave it, for he had been faithful to what was made known to him, &s;ince he gave up to the requirings of truth.</Q></P>

A vi&s;itation of divine love being extended to him about the twenty-&s;econd year of his age, he like Zaccheus, made ha&s;te, and with joy embraced, both the me&s;&s;age and the me&s;&s;enger of &s;alvation: And being endued with a gift in the mini&s;try, acquitted him|&s;elf "As a workman that need not be a&s;hamed," and had great place in the minds of men. Altho' he had not much &s;chool literature, yet he might be &s;aid to have had the tongue of the learned, being both cor|rect and conci&s;e in &s;peaking the word in &s;ea|&s;on, in&s;omuch that divers have confe&s;&s;ed to the truth and embraced the doctrine he preached. Being patient in tribulation, he was favour'd with that hope which affords content and &s;olace of mind.

<P>By which it will appear, that he was, in the early part of his life, &s;en&s;ibly affected with the vi&s;itation of divine life and grace, and, by adhering thereunto, was pre&s;erved from the vanities and follies, which often divert and alienate the minds of youth from the due remembrance and awful regard of their creator; &s;o that he was enabled to bear a te&s;timony of chri&s;tian patience and &s;elf-denial in his youthful days, and, by keep|ing under that exerci&s;e, as he advanced in years, attained to further knowledge and experience in the work of religion, in which he had a &s;ight of the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping in a &s;tate of humility, and of bearing the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, which mortified him to the world; &s;o that the lo&s;s many &s;u&s;tain by the anxious pur&s;uit of the lawful things thereof appear|ing to him, he was concerned to avoid it, and in obedience to the precept of Chri&s;t, to <HI>&s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> having faith in his promi&s;e, <HI>that all the&s;e things</HI> (nece&s;&s;ary for him) <HI>&s;hould be added.</HI></P>

became concerned for the general good of mankind, and received a gift of the mini|&s;try of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, before he had attained the age of twenty-one years; in the public exerci&s;e of which, he &s;oon after travelled thro' many parts of England, and into Scotland, and the next year, being 1697, he came to vi&s;it friends in this and the ad|jacent provinces of America, where his mi|ni&s;try and conver&s;ation were to the comfort and edification of the faithful, (as &s;ome of us can with &s;atisfaction declare, from our knowledge and remembrance of him at that time) and the near fellow&s;hip and union he then had with friends here (we believe) con|tributed to his more &s;peedy determination of &s;ettling among us, which he afterwards thought it his duty to do, tho' the leaving his parents and relations (as he afterwards expre&s;&s;ed) was no &s;mall cro&s;s to him, being of a dutiful and affectionate di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>After fixing his re&s;idence among us, he per&s;ever'd in his concern and labour for the edification of the churches, and gathering people to faith and dependance on the in|ward teachings of Chri&s;t, and for that pur|po&s;e only he travelled many long journies and voyages through the &s;everal Engli&s;h colonies on this continent, and mo&s;t of the i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies, and in Europe, through England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, Frizeland, and &s;everal parts of Germany, and the adjacent northern king|doms; and in many of the&s;e places his mi|ni&s;try

and religious labours were ble&s;&s;ed with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s, of which there are yet &s;ome witne&s;&s;es living, and others, who were convinced of the principles of truth by his means, became &s;erviceable members of the church, and continued therein to the end of their lives.</P>
<P>But as the wi&s;e king Solomon formerly ob&s;erved, that <HI>one event cometh to the righte|ous, and to the wicked,</HI> &s;o it happened to this good man, who met with various lo&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments in his temporal e&s;tate; af|ter which, the circum&s;tances of his affairs engaged him to undertake &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, in the management of which he was obliged to cro&s;s the &s;eas frequently: This, however, did not abate his zeal and religious care to make u&s;e of all opportunities of vi&s;iting the meetings of friends when among them, and of calling, at other times, to &s;uch who might be accounted as <HI>the outca&s;t of I&s;rael, and the di&s;per&s;ed of Judah, or as &s;heep not yet of the fold of Chri&s;t;</HI> and his &s;ervices of that kind are worthy to be commemorated, having been often productive of good effects.</P>
<P>His patience was remarkable in di&s;ap|pointments and afflictions, of which he had a large &s;hare; and his meekne&s;s, humility and circum&s;pection, in the general cour&s;e of his life and conver&s;ation, were con&s;picu|ous and exemplary; and as he frequently exhorted and admoni&s;hed others to the ob|&s;ervation and practice of the many excellent precepts and rules of Chri&s;t, our Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd

<P>The &s;everal E&s;&s;ays he wrote on religious &s;ubjects at &s;ea, are further proofs that his mind was principally engaged in the great bu&s;ine&s;s and concern of religion; and as he continued under the &s;ame engagement to the end, we are fully per&s;uaded the words with which he concluded his la&s;t public te&s;timony on the i&s;land of Tortola, may be truly and properly applied to him, <HI>that he had fought a good fight, and had kept the faith, and</HI> we doubt not, <HI>he now enjoys a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Much more might be truly &s;aid of his in|tegrity, faithfulne&s;s and worth, but we do not think it nece&s;&s;ary; our chief intention being to expre&s;s our re&s;pectful remembrance of him, and our unity with his labours and &s;ervices; and we are &s;incerely de&s;irous, that the glory of every good and perfect work may be attributed to that divine power alone, which can qualify others to &s;upply the places of tho&s;e faithful mini&s;ters and &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, who have been of late years removed from among us, and are of that number, of whom it is written, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are the dead, which die in the Lord, from hence|forth, yea, &s;aith the &s;pirit, that they may re&s;t from their labours, and their works do follow them.</HI></P>

<P>The next year 1728, he embark'd for Great-Britain, with our friend Samuel Bow|nas, who had accompli&s;hed his journeys on this continent in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel; and after performing a religious vi&s;it to the meetings of friends in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, he proceeded to Barba|dos, and arrived from thence in this city in 1730, then went to Virginia, and in the &s;ame year performed a vi&s;it as far ea&s;tward as Rhode-I&s;land, accompanied by his inti|mate friend Caleb <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">per of Burlington.</P>

<P>Hereby we may ob&s;erve his unwearied ap|plication and exerci&s;e, to fulfill the mini&s;try which he had received of the Lord.

<P>THE remembrance of our dear decea&s;ed friend John E&s;taugh, remains as a good &s;avour on many of our minds.

nearly united to a &s;olid remnant of friends that then belonged to Newtown-meeting, and that he had been careful to feel the draw|ings of the father's love in vi&s;iting neigh|bouring meetings, in many of which, he was favoured to mini&s;ter &s;uitably to the &s;tates and conditions of tho&s;e that heard him; he being as a &s;cribe well in&s;tructed, who brought forth out of the heavenly trea|&s;ury, things both new and old.&mdash;Since his fir&s;t &s;ettlement among us, he vi&s;ited friends in England, Ireland, New-England and &s;ome of the We&s;t-India-I&s;lands, &s;everal times.

<P>SINCE it plea&s;ed divine providence &s;o highly to favour me, with being the near companion of this dear worthy, I can|not be altogether &s;ilent, but mu&s;t give &s;ome &s;mall account of the early working of truth in him. He was born of religious parents, but grew unea&s;y with the religious profe&s;&s;ions of both father and mother who were of dif|ferent per&s;ua&s;ions, and being a &s;eeker, fell in with the bapti&s;ts, and liked them &s;o well he was near joining them. But a neighbour who was a friend, being dead, he was in|vited to the burial, where that worthy mi|ni&s;ter of the go&s;pel, Francis Stamper of London, being led to &s;peak with life and power directly to his &s;tate, it made &s;uch deep impre&s;&s;ions on his tender mind, that put him upon &s;earch into the principles of friends, and being fully &s;atisfied, joined with them in the &s;eventeenth year of his age.</P>
<P>About the eighteenth year of his age, he came forth in the mini&s;try, and being faith|ful he grew in his gift, &s;o that in &s;ome time he travelled to vi&s;it friends in the north of England, and Scotland, and in the year 1700 came over on a vi&s;it to friends in America. We were married on the fir&s;t day of the tenth
<PB N="122" REF="020377_0129_0FAF08651E46B3B0">
month 1702, and &s;ettled at Haddonfield in New-Jer&s;ey. In the fore part of his time he travelled pretty much; but in the latter part he was prevented therefrom by an infirmity of body; and his good ma&s;ter, who requires no impo&s;&s;ibilities of his &s;ervants, favoured him with being ea&s;y at home; where thro' mercy, we lived very comfortably; few, if any, in a married &s;tate, ever lived in &s;weet|er harmony than we did. He was a pattern of moderation in all things; not lifted up with any enjoyments, nor ca&s;t down at di&s;|appointments; a man endowed with many good gifts, which rendered him very agree|able to his friends, and much more to me, his wife.</P>
<P>After &s;ome years of indi&s;po&s;ition, (as be|fore is ob&s;erved) it plea&s;ed the Lord to re|&s;tore him to a &s;tate of health; and &s;oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> af|ter he had a concern to vi&s;it friends at Tor|tola. This brought on him a deep exerci&s;e, but when he was confirmed it was really re|quired of him, he gave up to it; and was then weaned from home, and the company there which u&s;ed to be &s;o plea&s;ant to him. He fir&s;t wrote to friends on that i&s;land; but finding that would not excu&s;e him, he dur&s;t no longer delay; &s;o, on the 13<HI>th</HI> of the eighth month 1742, we parted in the aboundings of love and affection. And now, the mo&s;t acceptable account I can give of his &s;ervice in Tortola, is extracted from two letters which I received from a friend of that place, directed to me, and to the following effect, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="020377_0130_0FAF0865872DA580">
<Q>On the eighth of the ninth month 1742, he arrived at the hou&s;e of John Pickering with his companion John Cadwalader, where they were received with much love and great joy, being made to rejoice together in the tender mercies and love of God, which was greatly manife&s;ted that day, to the honour and prai&s;e of his great name, and al&s;o to the comforting of his poor peo|ple. The te&s;timonies of the&s;e &s;ervants of the Lord were with life and power, and were as clouds fill'd with rain upon a thir|&s;ty land.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>But to be more particular concerning thy dear hu&s;band, who&s;e memory is dear and precious to me, and many more who&s;e hearts were open to receive the glad-ti|dings which he brought. His godly life and conver&s;ation &s;poke him to be a true follower of the the Lamb, and mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he freely preached, and by the effectual power of who&s;e di|vine love, was he called forth to our a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, for which we ble&s;s, prai&s;e and magnify the God of all our mercies: And as a faithful me&s;&s;enger, with much love, in a tender frame of &s;pirit, would he in|vite all to the fountain which had healed him. O! the deep humility that appear|ed in him in the time of his public te&s;ti|mony; and when in private conver&s;ation with his near and dear friends, as he of|ten &s;aid we were to him, how cheerful and plea&s;ant would he be, in that ble&s;&s;ed free|dom

wherein Chri&s;t had made him free, Innocent, harmle&s;s, of a cheerful coun|tenance, yet not without a chri&s;tian gra|vity well becoming the doctrine he preach|ed. He was valiant for the truth to the la&s;t, and tho' he is gone to his grave, his memory is &s;weet and precious.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He had his health very well until the death of his dear companion; but going to his burial, we were caught in a &s;hower of rain, which we and he believed was the occa&s;ion of his illne&s;s. However, he was mightily favoured with the divine pre&s;ence, which enabled him to an&s;wer the &s;ervice of that day; and the next, be|ing the fir&s;t day of the week, we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting, the Lord's pre&s;ence ac|companying us; and tho' thy dear hus|band was &s;o near his end, his candle &s;hin'd as bright as ever, and many that beheld it were made to glorify God on his behalf, This was the la&s;t opportunity on this i&s;land, &s;ave his farewell upon his dying bed, where he both preached and prayed, a lit|tle before his departure.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On the next day, being the &s;econd day of the week, he went to a little i&s;land call|ed Jos Vandicks, accompanied with &s;eve|ral friends; but on the 3<HI>d</HI> day in the morning he complained very much, yet was enabled to go to meeting, where a pretty many people were a&s;&s;embled, and a ble&s;&s;ed opportunity we had together, to the tendring and melting our hearts into a heavenly frame.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="020377_0132_0FAF0866B87B4250">
<Q>But he who never &s;pared his labour whil&s;t among&s;t us, extending his voice as a trumpet of the Lord's own &s;ounding, was &s;o inwardly &s;pent he was ready to faint. However, he went on board the &s;loop that afternoon, and next morning came a&s;hore at our hou&s;e; where he had not been long before a &s;hivering fit &s;eized him, and a fever &s;oon followed, which kept its con&s;tant cour&s;e every day. This being the 1<HI>&s;t</HI> day of the tenth month, he took great notice that it ended forty years &s;ince his marriage with thee; that during that time you had lived in much love, and parted in the &s;ame; and that thou wa&s;t his greate&s;t concern of all outward enjoy|ments. And tho' the la&s;t two days he was in much pain, yet he was pre&s;erved under it in much patience and re&s;ignation, and had his perfect &s;en&s;es to the la&s;t, exhort|ing friends to faithfulne&s;s, &amp;c. And on, the 6<HI>th</HI> day of the tenth month, about &s;ix-o'clock at night, he went away like a lamb, with prai&s;es and thank&s;givings in his lips but about two minutes before.</Q>

He married Mary the daughter of Robert Jordan of Nancemond county, and left a numerous offspring, &s;ome of them young, for who&s;e eternal welfare he was particularly &s;olicitous; being once on a vi&s;it to friends at &s;ome di&s;tance from home, he was taken very ill, and &s;eemed de&s;irous that he might fini&s;h his cour&s;e among his dear children, in order that he might have an opportunity at that awful period, of enfor|cing his experienced advices to them, and promoting the cau&s;e of God to which he was much devoted to the la&s;t.

<P>HE was a native of the principality of Wales, and arrived in Penn&s;ylvania in the year 1698. And altho' he was not then in profe&s;&s;ion with friends, yet he &s;oon after entered into clo&s;e fellow&s;hip with them, and continued &s;tedfa&s;t to his end. He was a diligent and &s;ea&s;onable attender of our re|ligious meetings: On fir&s;t days particular|ly, he was ready an hour before the time appointed, and then read &s;everal chapters in the bible or &s;ome religious book: As the time approached, he would frequently ob|&s;erve the time of day, and by means of &s;uch watchful care, he was &s;eated in meet|ings one of the fir&s;t, and &s;carcely ever af|ter the time appointed. The gravity and compo&s;ure of his countenance as he &s;at in &s;ilence, was no le&s;s remarkable than his punctual attendance, and be&s;poke &s;uch in|ward recollection and divine engagement of mind, as often attracted the eyes and affected the hearts of others.</P>
<P>He received a gift in the mini&s;try, in the exerci&s;e whereof, he was generally led to &s;peak of his own experience in religion and the chri&s;tian warfare; and his te&s;timony, tho' &s;hort, was in&s;tructive, lively, and ma|nife&s;tly attended with divine &s;weetne&s;s: Notwith&s;tanding it was always acceptable,
<PB N="131" REF="020377_0138_0FAF086B348B4370">
he was very cautious of appearing, le&s;t any, as he often &s;aid, &s;hould be drawn from a right concern of mind, to place their de|pendance on words.</P>
<P>He was zealou&s;ly concerned for the ho|nour and promotion of truth, and &s;upport of our chri&s;tian di&s;cipline; and being en|dued with di&s;cerning, and clear judgment tempered with charity, he was very u&s;eful in many &s;ervices of the church, e&s;pecially that weighty one of vi&s;iting friends in their families. And altho' he was naturally of a warm di&s;po&s;ition, yet a tender regard to the &s;ervice of truth, and a continual awe of the divine pre&s;ence pre&s;ided in his heart, in&s;omuch that meekne&s;s and conde&s;cention were con&s;picuous in his conduct.</P>
<P>There was a freedom and affability in his behaviour and conver&s;ation, which indicat|ed a benevolence of heart, and endeared him, not only to the <HI>hou&s;hold of faith,</HI> but al&s;o to the profligate and vain; rendering him &s;erviceable in compo&s;ing differences, and in comforting the &s;ick and afflicted; and par|ticularly in that &s;kilful and tender office of healing di&s;cord in private families, wherein his endeavours were remarkably &s;ucce&s;sful. In &s;uch &s;ervices, he &s;pent much of the lat|ter part of his life, riding about from one hou&s;e to another; and where no cau&s;e of re|prehen&s;ion appeared, he inter&s;per&s;ed his di&s;|cour&s;e on common affairs, with u&s;eful hints, &s;olid remarks, and le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction. But where admonition or comfort were ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="132" REF="020377_0139_0FAF086C10709670">
the propriety of his advice and the uprightne&s;s of his life, added weight to his labours, and &s;eldom failed of good effects.</P>
<P>In private life, few had a better claim to the virtues of temperance, ju&s;tice, indu&s;try and frugality, and as he well knew how advan|tageous it was, "To train up a child in the way he &s;hould walk," he took frequent op|portunities to drop his experienced advice among tho&s;e under his care. It was his practice, in winter evenings e&s;pecially, to read the holy &s;criptures in his family, and was particularly careful that neither child nor &s;ervant &s;hould be from home at un&s;ea|&s;onable hours&punc; being highly &s;en&s;ible how &s;lippery the paths of youth are, and how numerous the &s;nares which attend them.</P>
<P>He was greatly favoured in the u&s;e of his natural abilities, and enjoyed an uncommon &s;hare of health until his la&s;t illne&s;s, which was &s;hort; during that time, very many came to &s;ee him, who &s;hewed great marks of e&s;teem and affection; and even libertines whom he had often rebuked and treated with, were deeply affected with &s;orrow: In|deed it was rare to &s;ee &s;o many tears &s;hed at a &s;ick bed, more e&s;pecially of one of his years, which gave a proof that he had not outlived his &s;ervices. His &s;oul overflowed with love to God and man, and being fa|voured in his la&s;t moments, with a ble&s;&s;ed hope and confidence, he was going to that place which God had prepared for tho&s;e that

<P>WILLIAM LEVIS, of Kennet in Che&s;ter county Penn&s;ylvania, &s;on of Samuel Levis an early &s;ettler in Spring|field in &s;aid county, was born in Spring|field afore&s;aid, about the year 1688, and removed to Kennet about 1718.

<P>His la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s was the &s;mall pox, which was heavy upon him, but he bore it with much patience and re&s;ignation of mind to the la&s;t; &s;aying, that when the di&s;temper came into the hou&s;e, it was no &s;urprize to him, for he was freely re&s;igned, and thank|ful he was &s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or he could not of him&s;elf.

avail nothing.' He continued in a &s;tate of re&s;ignation and appeared cheerful in the time of his illne&s;s. When nearer his end, he was concern'd that others might do their duty faithfully according to the be&s;t of their under&s;tanding, &s;aying,
<Q>I have often thought at other times as at this, of the &s;hortne&s;s of our lives and time here, and the uncertainty thereof, which ought to engage us to circum&s;pection and faith|fulne&s;s to the Lord, and I charge you here that are elders, to di&s;charge your tru&s;t faithfully in the &s;ight of the Lord, having your eye &s;ingle to him, and let nothing of &s;elf rule, and then his work will be car|ried on in love and patience. I could be glad to have an opportunity once more with my friends, but if I &s;hould not, I would have tho&s;e pre&s;ent, to acquaint them with what I have to &s;ay, and pre&s;s it home to the elders, that they may faith|fully di&s;charge their duty, and acquit them&s;elves of that charge wherewith they are entru&s;ted; and al&s;o that parents of children and heads of families, may faith|fully di&s;charge that great duty which is laid upon them, not only in being good examples to their children and families, but al&s;o to be concerned that they follow their foot&s;teps, adding, it was a noble te&s;timony that God gave of Abraham, <HI>I know him, that he will command his chil|dren and his hou&s;hold after him.</HI> And if parents were concerned to teach their chil|dren

and bring them up in the way of their duty to God, and le&s;s concern'd to deck and &s;et them off, and provide things to make them look great in the world, it would be of far more benefit to them. And my de&s;ire is, that elders may walk faithfully as good &s;tewards, not only in their own families, but to the flock which they have the over&s;ight of; that &s;o they may leave a good &s;avour to the ri&s;ing and &s;ucceeding generation. I am &s;en&s;ible that all tho&s;e who are rightly concerned for the di&s;cipline and promotion of truth, will meet with trials from that libertine &s;pirit which would lay all wa&s;te; the&s;e will &s;ay, that religion con&s;i&s;ts not in &s;uch &s;mall things; but I have ob&s;erved, that one &s;mall thing makes way for another, and greater things will take place; and if there is not a careful watching again&s;t the&s;e &s;mall things, the eye that &s;hould be kept open to &s;ee the evil of them, will become darkened. But keep ye your places, and labour in faithfulne&s;s with &s;uch, if po&s;&s;i|ble to gain them; but if after friends la|bour, they will not be gathered, friends will be clear and have peace in them&s;elves; but a bla&s;t will come on &s;uch trouble&s;ome &s;pirits. And as friends faithfully main|tain this their di&s;cipline, the Lord will pre&s;erve them, but if they neglect it they will &s;urely &s;uffer lo&s;s.</Q>

<Q>It was a good work

At another time, being in a weighty frame of mind, he &s;aid,
<Q>There is an enemy bu|&s;y to accu&s;e the innocent, and prompts on the wicked in their wickedne&s;s.</Q>
See|ing his affectionate wife and &s;i&s;ter with &s;ome neighbours weeping, he &s;aid,
<Q>Don't weep for me, but be you faithful, and we &s;hall meet again, for it is the harde&s;t of all to &s;ee you weep.</Q></P>
<P>The morning before he died, he de&s;ired to be helped to the chamber where his elde&s;t &s;on lay ill of the &s;ame di&s;order, and &s;itting down by him, he charged his children to be dutiful to their mother, and have a care of doing any thing that would be a trouble to her, but mind to take her advice, and de&s;ired a ble&s;&s;ing might attend them; ad|ding,
<Q>My race is almo&s;t run, and I &s;hall lay down my head in peace with the Lord; and if you are faithful (meaning his wife and children) and live in the fear of God, he will ble&s;s you.</Q>
After &s;ome time of &s;ilence, he &s;aid,
<Q>Farewell my &s;on, the Lord ble&s;s thee my child, and thine after thee.</Q>
Being then helped down &s;tairs, he &s;at in his chair, and after a time of &s;ilence, cla&s;p|ed his hands together, &s;aying with a com|po&s;ed countenance, 'I ble&s;s thee O Lord' Afterwards laying &s;till in a quiet compo&s;ed frame of mind, he grew weaker and weak|er, and about the ninth hour in the even|ing, departed without &s;igh or groan, like

<P>HE was born in Merioneth&s;hire, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1684, and came to Penn&s;ylvania with his parents in 1698; under whom he received a &s;ober religious education; but, being ear|ly in life convinced, that a form of godli|ne&s;s, without the real enjoyment of the quickening principle of grace and truth, would not afford &s;olid and la&s;ting peace to his &s;oul, he therefore &s;ought earne&s;tly after it, and re&s;igned his heart to the baptizing power of God, which fitted him for eminent &s;ervices in the church.</P>
<P>In his con&s;tant attendance at our religi|ous meetings, he was a remarkable example of unaffected piety; for whil&s;t he &s;at in &s;ilence, the earne&s;tne&s;s wherewith his &s;oul "wre&s;tled for a ble&s;&s;ing," was obvious in the &s;teady engaged appearance of his counte|nance.

<PB N="138" REF="020377_0145_0FAF0872B9549708">
retained an awful &s;en&s;e of appearing in public te&s;timony, he was particularly cautious and watchful, not to pre&s;ume to &s;peak without a&s;&s;urance of a nece&s;&s;ity being laid upon him, and equally careful to at|tend to the continuance of it: And there|fore his "Preaching was not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, but in the demon|&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power." His &s;ervice was rendered more effectual, by the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks which he bore, of "An I&s;raelite indeed, in whom was no guile," a plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of manner in word and deed, with a zeal &s;ea&s;oned witb divine love; and as he had large experience in the work of regeneration and the my&s;te|ries of the heavenly kingdom, as well as the &s;nares of the world, he was thereby well qualified to admini&s;ter to the &s;tates of the people.</P>
<P>He travelled through many of the&s;e colo|nies in the &s;ervice of the mini&s;try, in com|pany with his relation and dear friend John Evans.

He al&s;o frequently vi&s;ited the &s;eve|ral counties in this province, and more par|ticularly many of the adjacent meetings in their infancy; wherein his unwearied la|bours of love, tended much to their com|fort, growth, and e&s;tabli&s;hment in the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="020377_0146_0FAF0873A42D0838">He was religiou&s;ly concerned for the &s;up|port of our chri&s;tian di&s;cipline; and as he was always diffident of him&s;elf, he labour|ed faithfully for the di&s;covery of truth and a di&s;po&s;ition of mind to embrace it; where|by he was often enabled to lay "Judgment to the line, and righteou&s;ne&s;s to the plum|met," whether in reproof to the obdurate, or in&s;truction and comfort to the penitent. In vi&s;iting friends families his &s;ervice was great; for being endued with a &s;pirit of di&s;|cerning and the authority of truth, his ad|vice was adapted with great propriety and advantage, to the particular &s;tates and con|ditions of per&s;ons and families.

About the twenty-fir&s;t year of his age, he received a gift in the mini&s;try, in which he was frequently exerci&s;ed during the cour&s;e of his life. His mini&s;try was &s;ound and &s;avoury, attended with a good degree of that life and power "By which the dead are rai&s;ed, and without which all preaching is vain." He was not tedious or burden|&s;ome, but often very reaching and edifying to his hearers. In his life and conver&s;ation he was grave, yet innocently cheerful, and &s;trictly ju&s;t in his dealings, al&s;o a lover and promoter of peace, unity, and brotherly love among&s;t friends, of which him&s;elf was a good pattern.

<P>SHE was convinced of the truth in her native country, Wales, when young, which incurred her father's heavy di&s;plea|&s;ure, but in time he became reconciled to her.

u&s;eful in her generation and a ble&s;&s;ing to many. Her love and companion for the widow, the fatherle&s;s, and others in afflic|tion, appeared by her often vi&s;iting them: She was one of the wi&s;e in heart, who was favoured to fore&s;ee the enemy in his ap|proaches, and would rou&s;e and excite her fellow-&s;oldiers to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endea|vours to repel his attempts, which was of|ten done with de&s;irable. &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>She was rightly qualified for the weighty &s;ervice of vi&s;iting friends families, and at tho&s;e opportunities was frequently favoured with &s;omething &s;uitable to every &s;tate and condition, which was attended with bene|ficial effects, e&s;pecially on the youth. But &s;uch indeed was the divine &s;avour which u&s;ually accompanied her di&s;cour&s;e and con|ver&s;ation, one could rarely be an hour with her without &s;en&s;ible edification.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t coming to re&s;ide among us was &s;ea&s;onable, for we having but few mini&s;ters, the field before her was exten&s;ive, in which &s;he laboured fervently, tenderly inviting tho&s;e afar off to draw nigh, and querying with them, whether they knew what the Lord had for them to do. By the vi&s;itati|ons of heaven and a ble&s;&s;ing on her labours, many came to have their mouths opened to &s;peak of God's goodne&s;s to their &s;ouls; whereby was verified, what &s;he had declar|ed at our meeting before &s;he came to dwell

<P>She went pretty much abroad, vi&s;iting friends in this and the adjacent provinces, to wit, the Jer&s;eys, Maryland, Virginia and Carolina, accompanied to the remote&s;t parts by her near and dear friend Su&s;anna Mor|ris. In her more advanced years &s;he vi&s;ited Great-Britain, accompanied by our e&s;teem|ed friend Mary Pennel, between whom a near and &s;trict union was pre&s;erved through|out their travels; and &s;he brought home very clear and comfortable accounts of her acceptable &s;ervice in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, and her godly conver&s;ation in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>After her return from Great-Britain, &s;he met with great difficulties in re&s;pect to her outward circum&s;tances, which &s;he &s;u&s;tained with chri&s;tian fortitude. A near friend of hers a&s;king her how &s;he felt under it, &s;he replied,
<Q>While I keep my eye &s;teadily di|rected to the object worthy of our chief regard, it &s;eems as if a wall was on each &s;ide; all is calm, and nothing hurts or annoys: But if I &s;uffer my eye to wander to the right hand or the left, the enemy breaks in upon me like a torrent, which hurries me away, and it is with great difficulty I recover my&s;elf.</Q>
After this, &s;he met with a very heavy affliction in the

lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, which &s;he likewi&s;e bore with becoming re&s;ignation and com|po&s;ure of mind. In a few months after|wards, &s;he fell into a lingering di&s;order; (the drop&s;y) and as in time of health &s;he preferred the pro&s;perity of truth to her chief joy, &s;o in her illne&s;s &s;he rejoiced much to hear of any young people ap|pearing hopeful in the mini&s;try. On the other hand, &s;he would, even in time of great weakne&s;s, lament with anxiety of mind the low &s;ituation of the &s;eed, and &s;ay Oh! what will become of us? Will this dark cloud which hangs over our a&s;|&s;emblies, terminate in a boi&s;terous &s;torm to try the foundations of the children of men?</P>
<P>By the long continuance of her di&s;order, &s;he was reduced to great weakne&s;s &s;ometime before her end; yet it was evident, that charity, (to wit) Love to God and his peo|ple, continued with her to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>She died on the 9<HI>th</HI> day of the fourth month 1750, in the &s;eventy-third year of her age, having been a mini&s;ter 50 years, and was buried at Gwynedd afore&s;aid; on which &s;olemn occa&s;ion we had a good meet|ing, the extendings of divine love being witne&s;&s;ed.</P>

diligent and &s;ea&s;onable attender of meet|ings, and a lover of the hone&s;t hearted, but always hated hypocri&s;y in any. He twice vi&s;ited friends in the we&s;tern parts of America, going once as far as North-Carolina.&mdash;Before he proceeded on his la&s;t journey into tho&s;e parts, he appeared re&s;igned to the will of God, and much weaned from the things of this world; his kin&s;man Adam Mott accompanied him, and by te&s;timonials receiv'd from &s;everal meetings, their &s;ervice was well accepted. On his way homeward, he was taken &s;ick at Oblong in New-York government, bearing his pain with great patience to the la&s;t; and whil&s;t his under&s;tanding was clear, often mention'd his concern for the pro&s;perity of truth. In the time of his &s;ickne&s;s he wrote a letter to his wife, wherein he expre&s;s'd his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God whether in life or death, de&s;iring &s;he might experi|ence the &s;ame; and in an e&s;pecial manner reque&s;ted her care in the education of their children, to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; keep them from hurtful and unprofitable company, and endeavour to in&s;til into their minds the chri&s;tian principles of patience, temperance, meekne&s;s and &s;obriety, that &s;o they might be made fit ve&s;&s;els for the holie&s;t to dwell in. In another letter wrote to his children, in the time of his &s;ickne&s;s, we find the&s;e words,

<P>OUR dear friend Peter Andrews, from We&s;t-Jer&s;ey in North-America, being on a religious vi&s;it to friends in this nation, decea&s;ed in this city; and the lively &s;en&s;e of his &s;ervices, and the regard we bear to his memory, engages us to tran&s;mit the following te&s;timony concerning him.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t vi&s;it to us was in the eleventh month 1755, and his &s;ervice and exemplary deportment will remain as a la&s;ting te&s;timo|ny for him, and to the truth he preached, in the minds of many; and we have good rea&s;on to believe he was made in&s;trumental, in a very particular manner, to the help and furtherance of &s;ome among&s;t us, whom it had plea&s;ed the Lord to vi&s;it with a fre&s;h vi&s;it|ation of his love. And by the information of other friends, who well knew him, and particularly our friend Edmund Peckover, who frequently accompanied him, as well as from our own knowledge, we are enabled to give the following brief account of his labours and travels, from the time of his arrival to his death.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="020377_0177_0FAF089396962E48">He landed in the &s;outh part of England, in or about the &s;ixth month 1755, and came directly up to London, where he was kindly received by friends, and had very good &s;er|vice during a &s;hort &s;tay there; but being de|&s;irous of being at the quarterly-meeting to be held at York, in company with &s;everal friends of London, he went as directly to the &s;aid city as he could well do, being near two hundred miles, and reached there by the 24<HI>th</HI> of the &s;ixth month, at which time began the quarterly-meeting; and this our dear friend had a very memorable and weigh|ty opportunity in mini&s;try, in the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders at the opening there|of; but, in the &s;ucceeding meetings for wor&s;hip, was mo&s;tly &s;ilent; yet in tho&s;e for di&s;cipline, was divinely led to &s;et forth the na|ture, good end and tendency of the &s;ame, and very zealou&s;ly pre&s;&s;ed to the keeping them up, in the &s;ame wi&s;dom and power in which they were fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed; evidently &s;etting forth,
<Q>that they proceeded from that which gathered our fore-fathers to be as a pecu|liar people unto God;</Q>
to the no &s;mall edi|fication and comfort of many &s;incere hearts, who rejoiced greatly in having his company, which remains fre&s;h in their remembrance; his &s;ervices being as bread ca&s;t upon the waters, which, according to the wi&s;e man's ob&s;ervation, <HI>&s;hall be found after many days.</HI></P>
<P>After the quarterly-meeting was ended he went to Pickering, where a very large meet|ing is kept annually for wor&s;hip, and had
<PB N="171" REF="020377_0178_0FAF0893B2B8D530">
&s;ea&s;onable and profitable &s;ervice. He tra|velled to many other places in that county, and friends were greatly refre&s;hed and edi|fied by his chri&s;tian vi&s;it, though not always attended by public declarations in their re|ligious meetings appointed on his account, which were mo&s;tly very large, and expecta|tions high, yet his eye was to his great ma|&s;ter's putting forth. He often was led to fami&s;h that too eager de&s;ire after words; and in &s;everal public meetings he had nothing to &s;ay among&s;t them; which tho' a great di&s;|appointment to many for the pre&s;ent, yet there afterwards appeared a &s;ignal &s;ervice in it.</P>
<P>He was at Yarm, Stockton, Bainbrig, and &s;everal other meetings in and about the Dales; then came to Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Donca&s;ter, and &s;o into Lincoln&s;hire; which county he vi&s;ited pretty generally, al&s;o the i&s;le of Ely, and came into Norfolk, and to this place in the eleventh month 1755, as afore-mentioned; was at mo&s;t, if not all, of friends meetings in our county; then went into Suffolk and E&s;&s;ex, and returned to Lon|don the latter end of the fir&s;t month 1756, where he remained a few weeks, being ex|ceeding ill; yet was at mo&s;t of the meet|ings in that city, and was very &s;erviceable, with many other friends, in affairs particu|larly relating to the &s;ociety in Penn&s;ylvania at that time.</P>
<P>He went back again into E&s;&s;ex, and &s;o for Hertford&s;hire, &s;ome parts of Buckingham|&s;hire,
<PB N="172" REF="020377_0179_0FAF089474C22E08">
Oxford&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and to the yearly-meeting at Bri&s;tol in the fifth month 1756; and had good &s;ervice both in meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, which was well received, and, it is hoped, made la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of many who had the opportunity of being pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>His indi&s;po&s;ition &s;till continued, but did not hinder him from travelling: From Bri&s;|tol he pa&s;&s;ed through &s;ome part of Glouce&s;|ter&s;hire, Wilt&s;hire, and Oxford&s;hire, and got to the yearly-meeting at London in the &s;ixth month, and altho' his illne&s;s continued up|on him, was enabled to bear &s;everal living te&s;timonies, in the demon&s;tration of the &s;pi|rit and of power.</P>
<P>After the &s;aid yearly-meeting was ended, he came down to the yearly-meetings at Colche&s;ter and Woodbridge, where he was eminently &s;upported to be &s;erviceable in the churches. At Woodbridge he was &s;trengthened to bear a large, powerful and affecting te&s;timony in the la&s;t meeting of wor&s;hip, to the tendering of many hearts, who&s;e &s;tates were &s;o effectually &s;poken to, as that it may be fitly compared to the ex|cellency, and glorious &s;ituation which the P&s;almi&s;t de&s;cribed, when he &s;ays,
<Q>How good, and how plea&s;ant a thing it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aa|ron's beard, that went down to the &s;kirts of his garments: As the dew of Hermon,

and as the dew that de&s;cended upon the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord commanded the ble&s;&s;ing, even life for evermore,</Q>
P&s;alm cxxxiii. 1, 2, 3. It was indeed a mo&s;t heavenly, precious, bap|tizing &s;ea&s;on, (this being the la&s;t public op|portunity our dear friend had) in which he was wonderfully led to &s;et forth the progre&s;|&s;ive &s;teps the Almighty was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of, in appearing to Gideon, confirming him in the certainty of his requirings, con|de&s;cending to grant his reque&s;ts in a very peculiar manner, and &s;ealing them with his pre&s;ence, and giving him victory over his enemies, as he was faithful to follow the ble&s;&s;ed author that pointed forth the begin|ning as well as fini&s;hing that great work, to which that extraordinary &s;ervant of God, Gideon, in his day was called; which me|morable &s;ervice of our dear friend, there is great rea&s;on to believe the great Lord, who prepared him for the &s;ame, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to fix as a nail in a &s;ure place; and may it &s;o continue in the remembrance of tho&s;e then pre&s;ent, who are left for a &s;mall &s;pace yet in mutability.</P>
<P>He continued very weak in body all his &s;tay in Woodbridge, being above five days, and no per&s;ua&s;ions could prevail with him to hinder his &s;etting forward for his jour|ney, having &s;trong de&s;ires in his mind to &s;ee friends in this place again; and to a par|ticular friend he expre&s;&s;ed his love &s;o great to us,
<Q>That he thought he could willingly

He was favoured to accom|pli&s;h it in two days after he left Woodbridge, though with great difficulty, and lodged at the hou&s;e of our friend John Oxley, as he had done before, but took to his bed &s;oon after he got in, to which, the remaining part of his time, he was mo&s;tly confined.</P>
<P>It being the time of our yearly-meeting, many friends went often to vi&s;it him, and he expre&s;&s;ed to &s;ome,
<Q>That he was &s;atisfied he was in his place, in giving up to follow the requiring of the Lord, in leaving his outward habitation, and tho&s;e near ble&s;|&s;ings of a mo&s;t tender affectionate wife and dutiful children.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;everity of his illne&s;s kept him mo&s;t|ly delirious, yet he was favour'd with &s;ome clear intervals; in one of which, being in a &s;weet heavenly frame of mind, he broke forth in the following fervent &s;upplication, viz.
<Q>Oh! this poor &s;oul hath been for many days on the brink of the pit of di&s;tre&s;s; but thou, dear father, do&s;t not afflict thy children willingly, but for &s;ome great and good cau&s;e known only to thy&s;elf: Dear father! &s;uffer not thy children ever to de|&s;pair of thy mercies, but that we may be helpful, as much as may be in our pow|er, to one another in all &s;uch times of trouble. Deare&s;t father! thou ha&s;t been plea&s;ed to open, and to favour with thy goodne&s;s; my &s;oul is thankful, and can &s;ay, thou art worthy of glory and prai&s;e for evermore.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="020377_0182_0FAF0898D2DC0890">He continued to the 13<HI>th</HI> of the &s;eventh month 1756, and then departed this life, and was interr'd in friends burying-ground the 18<HI>th</HI> of the &s;ame, after an awful meeting, (his corps being attended by a very large number of friends and others) and no doubt he re&s;ts, with the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, in tho&s;e glorious man&s;ions prepared for all tho&s;e that hold out in faithfune&s;s to the end. His memory is very precious and dear to many who are yet &s;urviving, and we believe it may truly be &s;aid, that few friends who have travelled in this nation, have been more approved, or had more general &s;ervice in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time.</P>

<P>HE was the &s;on of John and Elizabeth Fearon, of Great-Broughton, in Cum|berland, and born in or about the year 1683. He came among&s;t friends on a prin|ciple of convincement, during his appren|tice&s;hip with his uncle Peter Fearon, and appeared in a few words in meetings before he was twenty years of age. In the latter end of 1703, with the concurrence of friends, he left England, and landed in Virginia, where he &s;taid about three months, then came to Burlington in the &s;econd month 1704, and from that time until his decea&s;e, he was a u&s;eful member of this meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="020377_0225_0FAF07919C55DC48">Between the years 1704 and 1730, he travelled in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel, through mo&s;t parts of this continent where meetings were then &s;ettled, and to &s;ome provinces &s;e|veral times; and employed above two years in vi&s;iting friends in England, Scotland and Ireland; returning with &s;atisfactory certifi|cates of the approbation and unity of friends with his religions labours.</P>
<P>After tho&s;e travels, his worldly circum|&s;tances being attended with difficulties, and his de&s;ires earne&s;t that he might get through them with credit, he went many voyages to &s;ea as a factor, chiefly to Bo&s;ton and the i&s;land of Barbados; and thro' many diffi|culties, he was enabled to pay his debts, and to &s;ave &s;ufficient, with indu&s;try and care, to yield a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance in old age, and to be helpful to &s;ome others. In tho&s;e undertakings he took certificates, and re|turned &s;uch as were very &s;atisfactory, both of his diligence in his outward bu&s;ine&s;s, and of his care to edify the churches with the gift of mini&s;try which had been committed to him. Whil&s;t in Barbados in the begin|ning of 1746, a concern came upon him to vi&s;it friends on Tortola, which by their large and full certificate, appears to have been very &s;ea&s;onable; and was the fir&s;t after our worthy friends Thomas Chalkley, John Cadwallader and John E&s;taugh, had laid down their heads in peace among them. They &s;ay,

a cloud full of rain upon a thir&s;ty land, greatly to our mutual comfort and joy in the Lord, and in one another.</Q></P>
<P>One of his la&s;t voyages by &s;ea, was in 1750, and on purpo&s;e to perform a religious vi&s;it to friends in Barbados and Tortola, having our friend Thomas Lanca&s;ter for his companion; and when they had performed their &s;ervice, the &s;aid friend was, after a &s;harp &s;ickne&s;s, removed by death at &s;ea. Be&s;ides this, he met with other &s;ore trials in his pilgrimage through life, particularly in the long confinement of his wife, who was &s;eized with the pal&s;y five years before her death, and lay mo&s;t of that time entirely helple&s;s. His behaviour towards her, was as an affectionate hu&s;band, with much ten|derne&s;s and care; and indeed his frequent practice of vi&s;iting the &s;ick and afflicted, evidenced a &s;ympathizing heart, and was very becoming his &s;tation.</P>
<P>He was pre&s;erved in the exerci&s;e of his mini&s;try, in much love and go&s;pel &s;implici|ty. And his &s;en&s;e of the nature and &s;pirit in which the di&s;cipline &s;hould be managed, is thus expre&s;s'd in an epi&s;tle which he wrote to friends on Tortola, viz.
<Q>That you may grow up together a &s;piritual hou&s;e that holine&s;s becomes, and a care according to go&s;pel order may be kept to among&s;t you, and that no har&s;hne&s;s be u&s;ed one towards another, but tender and helpful, and not apt to judge or cen&s;ure one another, that you may be kept in that univer&s;al &s;pirit

of love, that &s;eeks the good of all and hurt of none, and yet gives all their due, and what is right and ju&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>His diligence in attending religious meet|ings was remarkable, for though he lived three miles from the particular meeting of Burlington to which he belonged, it was very uncommon for bodily infirmities, or any extremities of weather to keep him at home on meeting days; and the year before his decea&s;e, he vi&s;ited &s;everal general meet|ings both in this and the neighbouring pro|vinces.</P>
<P>A life &s;o &s;pent in fervent endeavours to promote truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s among man|kind, was, we have cau&s;e to hope, in a &s;uita|ble preparation to be clo&s;ed at a &s;hort warn|ing. He was &s;eized with a fit by his own fire &s;ide, which quickly deprived him of under&s;tanding, and about three days after he breathed his la&s;t, on the 21<HI>&s;t</HI> of the twelfth month 1762, in the &s;eventy-ninth year of his age, having been a mini&s;ter about 60 years. He was interr'd on the 23<HI>d</HI> in friends burying-ground at Burlington, after a &s;olid meeting held on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having ob&s;erved &s;trict temperance and moderation, he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e in a good old age; being an example of prudence and &s;teadine&s;s, which we de&s;ire may be often remembred, and u&s;efully improved to the advantage of &s;uch as are left behind.</P>

<P>He was born in Merioneth&s;hire, in the principality of Wales, and came over with his parents into Penn&s;ylvania, when about twelve years of age.</P>
<P>He was naturally of a very cheerful di&s;|po&s;ition, and for &s;ome time indulged him&s;elf in keeping company with &s;uch, who&s;e con|ver&s;ation and conduct were unprofitable and vain, for which, though we do not under|&s;tand he was guilty of immoral practices, he was clo&s;ely reproved by the witne&s;s of God in &s;ecret, and his condition being thereby plainly manife&s;ted to him, as likewi&s;e the danger of pur&s;uing &s;uch cour&s;es, he did not dare to go any longer in vanity: but &s;ub|mitting to the reproofs of in&s;truction, was brought under great exerci&s;e and godly &s;or|row; in which &s;tate, the conver&s;ation of his former companions, once his delight, be|came a burden and increa&s;ed his di&s;tre&s;s; but avoiding to feed their light airy di&s;po&s;i|tions, keeping his mind retired, and read|ing
<PB N="224" REF="020377_0231_0FAF0796421831A0">
the holy &s;criptures, when they &s;ought to entice him, had &s;uch an effect, that they for&s;ook him, which was a great ea&s;e to his mind, in that it afforded him opportunity for a further &s;earch after the will of him, who in mercy had called him to glory and virtue. As he was thus engaged, after many deep bapti&s;ms and trials, it plea&s;ed the Lord, about the thirty-fourth year of his age, to call him to the work of the mini&s;try; which was an exceeding humbling exerci&s;e to him, and many &s;ore conflicts he had therein, through the buffetings of Satan; but by en|deavouring to follow the Lord in the way of his requirings, help was admini&s;tred, &s;o that he at times, had to experience, that he gives
<Q>The oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of prai&s;e for the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>His chief inducement to come and &s;et|tle in the&s;e parts, was a &s;trong draught of love attending his mind, which however he did not ha&s;tily give way to, having felt drawings hither near eight years before he came; of &s;o great moment did the removing him&s;elf and family appear to him.</P>
<P>He was a diligent attender of fir&s;t and week day meetings for wor&s;hip, as al&s;o of our monthly, quarterly and yearly meet|ings, even when age and infirmity of body rendered travelling very difficult to him. He likewi&s;e vi&s;ited &s;ome of the neighbour|ing provinces on truth's &s;ervice, with the unity of friends; and by accounts which
<PB N="225" REF="020377_0232_0FAF0797352EFD80">
we have had from the places he vi&s;ited, his labours of love were well received and &s;er|viceable.</P>
<P>From the time of his coming among&s;t us, he was always one of the number, who went on the vi&s;it to friends families; which weighty work he undertook in much diffi|dence of him&s;elf, and fear of a forward &s;pirit, often &s;aying,
<Q>That former appoint|ments and engagements thereto, were of no account for future &s;ervices; but that &s;uch as went, mu&s;t wait for renewed qualifications to enter upon that work,</Q>
which he u&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q>He thought mu&s;t be a good one, &s;ince it occa&s;ioned greater nearne&s;s, and was a renewal of love, both among vi&s;itors and vi&s;ited:</Q>
And by ac|counts received, it was &s;o in a good degree.</P>
<P>In meetings for wor&s;hip he was a good example in &s;ilent patient waiting upon the Lord, and when rai&s;ed to bear a public te&s;timony, it was with that power and authority, which accompanies a true go&s;pel mini&s;ter, and hath made la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions upon &s;ome minds. Though he was of an exceeding tender di&s;po&s;ition, yet being a lover of good order in the church, and well knowing the dangerous tendency of undue liberty, he both by precept and example, endeavoured to promote the former and di&s;|courage the latter; in which he gave repeated proofs, that the near connections of natural kindred did not bias his judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="020377_0233_0FAF079822A47C08">His deportment being meek and loving, and his conver&s;ation familiar and in&s;truc|tively cheerful, gained him the e&s;teem of mo&s;t who knew him, of different ranks and religious per&s;ua&s;ions. He was a nur&s;ing father in the church, and particularly &s;o to divers whom the Lord had vi&s;ited that were under affliction, whether of body or mind; nor was his charity in this re&s;pect confined to the members of our &s;ociety.</P>
<P>He was an affectionate hu&s;band, a tender parent, a kind ma&s;ter; and having, by the ble&s;&s;ing of divine providence on his hone&s;t indu&s;try, obtained a competency of the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, was very ho&s;pitable, enter|taining both friends and others freely and kindly, not with o&s;tentation or for applau&s;e, but for the promotion of piety and virtue, and the good of mankind.</P>
<P>As his natural &s;trength abated in the la&s;t years of his life, he appeared more bright and lively in his public mini&s;try, both at home and abroad; and the day he was taken ill of his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, at the funeral of one of his &s;ons, which was the la&s;t meeting he was at, he was remarkably favoured in his public te&s;timony to a large gathering of peo|ple; and in &s;upplication at the &s;ame meet|ing, his great Lord and ma&s;ter was plea&s;ed to favour him with a tran&s;cendent view in|to the beauty of holine&s;s, crowning; a life, a great part of which had been, according to the mea&s;ure received, devoted to his ho|nour, with evident tokens of his being near
<PB N="227" REF="020377_0234_0FAF0798718E14B8">
to the kingdom of re&s;t and peace everla&s;ting. And the &s;ame evening he was taken ill at his own hou&s;e in Exeter afore&s;aid, and con|tinued for about eleven days, mo&s;tly in ex|treme pain, yet bore it with patience and re&s;ignation to the divine will; and though he inclined much to be &s;till and quiet, utter|ed many comfortable expre&s;&s;ions, &s;ome of which were taken down in writing. At one time he &s;aid,
<Q>It is a fine thing to have a clear con&s;cience.</Q>
And one morning,
<Q>Here is another day, Lord &s;o pre&s;erve me through it, that I may do nothing to of|fend thee.</Q>
In the evening he &s;aid,
<Q>Lord ble&s;s this night to me.</Q>
And taking &s;ome|thing to give him ea&s;e, he &s;aid.
<Q>He that turned water into wine is able to give a ble&s;&s;ing.</Q>
After laying &s;till &s;ome time, &s;aid,
<Q>Sorrow at night, but joy cometh in the morning.</Q>
And in the morning he &s;aid,
<Q>I remember a dream I had about fifty years ago, I thought I was in a room alone, ju&s;t going to die, and as I was much con|cerned and troubled becau&s;e there was no one pre&s;ent to &s;ee me die, I thought the great phy&s;ician of value &s;tood by me and &s;aid, <HI>I will be with thee;</HI> and I have a lit|tle faith, that he will be with me, and if I am favoured with my &s;en&s;es, hope I &s;hall not give over wre&s;tling for a ble&s;&s;ing.</Q>
A little before noon he &s;aid,
<Q>Lord, this is the way of mortal men, when they come to lie on a &s;ick bed, they crave thy favour, though at other times many are forgetful
<PB N="228" REF="020377_0235_0FAF079985B1C380">
of thee.</Q>
At another time he &s;aid,
<Q>Though affliction may not &s;eem plea&s;ant during its continuance, yet it worketh an exceed|ing great joy to them that love and fear God.</Q>
And in the evening, being in great bodily pain, &s;aid,
<Q>Lord give me ea&s;e if it be thy ble&s;&s;ed will.</Q>
The next day be|ing the fir&s;t day of the week, &s;everal friends came to &s;ee him before meeting, to whom he &s;aid,
<Q>Fear God and &s;erve him, and his regard will be unto you, but if you neglect to wor&s;hip him, he will ca&s;t you off for|ever,</Q>
or words nearly to that import. And being fearful they would over &s;tay the time for meeting, inquired what hour, &s;aying to them,
<Q>Don't neglect the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Lord:</Q>
And when they were going, de|&s;ired,
<Q>They would remember him when it was well with them.</Q>
In the evening inquiring what &s;ort of a meeting they had that day, and being an&s;wered, a good meet|ing; he &s;aid with &s;eeming joy,
<Q>The Lord is not limited to per&s;ons, but all that wor|&s;hip him aright &s;hall be accepted of him,</Q>
or words to that effect. A little after mid|night, being in great bodily pain, and from the &s;ymptoms, it was thought for about an hour he was departing, during which he appeared to have his mind retired to the Lord, and then reviving a little &s;aid,
<Q>This has been a ble&s;&s;ed meeting.</Q>
The next morning taking leave of a neighbour, he &s;aid,
<Q>Farewell, and if we never meet again in this world, I hope we &s;hall meet in a
<PB N="229" REF="020377_0236_0FAF079C14AB88D0">
more glorious place among the righteous.</Q>
The day before his departure his &s;peech fail|ed much, tho' he remained very &s;en&s;ible; and the la&s;t words he was heard to &s;ay, were, 'Lord in heaven receive my &s;oul.' Then growing weaker until the third hour next morning, being the 11<HI>th</HI> of the fir&s;t month 1764, he departed this life, in a quiet frame of mind, aged &s;eventy-&s;ix years and &s;ome months. His corps was interr'd in friends burying-ground at Exeter afore&s;aid, accom|panied by a large number of his friends and neighbours.</P>

<HEAD>A Te&s;timony from <HI>Bradford</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>MARY PENNEL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SHE was born in Radnor&s;hire, in Wales, and educated by her parents in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the church of England. About the thirteenth year of her age, going with her elder &s;i&s;ter to a meeting of friends, who were &s;itting in awful &s;ilence, with tears drop|ping down the cheeks of divers, it made &s;uch religious impre&s;&s;ion on her tender mind, that &s;he thereby became in &s;ome de|gree, convinced of the truth. About the &s;ixteenth year of her age, &s;he arrived in Penn&s;ylvania, where living in a friend's family, and experiencing the renewed vi&s;its of truth, &s;he became willing to come more clo&s;ely under the di&s;cipline of the cro&s;s, and

joined with friends; was married to John Pennel, and re&s;ided within the compa&s;s of Concord meeting many years. Being di|vers years under a weighty exerci&s;e to appear in public mini&s;try, about the year 1722, &s;he gave up thereto, and increa&s;ing in her gift, had in time, a refre&s;hing edifying te&s;|timony; being well approved by her friends at home, and frequently led into the &s;tates of meetings where her lot was ca&s;t; in the exerci&s;e of the mini&s;try &s;he travelled into the ea&s;tern provinces, al&s;o into Great-Bri|tain and Ireland, where in divers places, &s;he had acceptable &s;ervice, to the &s;trengthening &s;ome tender minds in the way and work of truth. Afterwards removing with her hu&s;|band to Ea&s;t Caln, they re&s;ided there the re|mainder of their time; and &s;everal years before her decea&s;e, her under&s;tanding by rea&s;on of age, became weak, yet &s;he was pre&s;erv'd in much innocency, having a love and regard to friends, and was always plea&s;|ed with their vi&s;its.</P>

<P>SHE was born at Burlington, in We&s;t-New-Jer&s;ey, in the year 1691, being the daughter of Charles Read, who was one of the early &s;ettlers of Penn&s;ylvania under

the grant to William Penn. It plea&s;ed the Lord to extend his gracious vi&s;itation to her in her tender age, which as &s;he &s;ubmitted to and abode under, &s;he happily experienced to lead her into a life of righteou&s;ne&s;s and great circum&s;pection. About the eighteenth year of her age, &s;he was married to our worthy friend I&s;rael Pemberton, who united with her in a pious concern for the pro&s;peri|ty and prevalence of the cau&s;e of truth, her &s;incere love to which and the friends there|of, &s;he uniformly manife&s;ted by her kind &s;ympathetic care as a "Mother in I&s;rael." She u&s;efully filled the &s;tation of an over&s;eer and elder, being carefully concerned to rule her own family well, and that her offspring might have a portion in that trea&s;ure which faileth not. She was a true &s;ympathizer with tho&s;e under affliction of body or mind, de|mon&s;trating her &s;en&s;ibility herein, by her frequent vi&s;its to &s;uch, which were weighty and comforting, her conver&s;ation being &s;o|lid and in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t month 1754, it plea&s;ed divine providence to deprive her of her beloved hu&s;band, in whom was removed, a father, a friend, and coun&s;ellor to her and the church; which clo&s;e trial (after 40 years living toge|ther in much harmony) &s;he was enabled to bear with chri&s;tian calmne&s;s and re&s;ignati|on; having often to experience the reality of that truth left upon record,
<Q>A father to the fatherle&s;s, and a judge for the wi|dow, is God in his holy habitation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="020377_0240_0FAF079EB6F922A8">She continued her hou&s;e open for the re|ception of friends near and from remote parts, as it had been in her hu&s;band's time, particularly for the entertainment of tho&s;e who came from Europe on religious vi&s;its to America, with whom &s;he was often dipt in|to much feeling &s;ympathy under their weigh|ty travel and exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Few have been more zealou&s;ly concerned, and diligent in the attendance of religious meetings, &s;eldom allowing the inclemency of weather to prevent her; and continu|ed to manife&s;t the like concern when very feeble; which diligence, was, in the time of her confinement and langui&s;hing &s;tate, a &s;atisfactory reflection to her, as her attend|ance had been from a real &s;en&s;e and per&s;ua|&s;ion of duty.</P>

<HEAD>A Te&s;timony from <HI>Gwynedd</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>ELLEN EVANS,</HI> an elder of &s;aid meeting.</HEAD>
<P>SHE was the daughter of Rowland and Margaret Ellis, born near Dollegelle, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1685. She was favoured with a good under&s;tand|ing, which being improved by a religious education and &s;trict attention to the dictates of divine grace, &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed her as one &s;eeking after heavenly trea&s;ure, which made her in riper years, an honourable member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>She married our worthy and much e&s;teem|ed friend John Evans, of this place, to whom &s;he was truly a help-meet, more e&s;pecially in public religious &s;ervices; for whenever &s;he di&s;covered the lea&s;t inclination in him, to vi&s;it the meetings of friends whether far or near, &s;he did all in her power to cheri&s;h and encourage the motion; &s;he was al&s;o a great &s;upport and comfort to him under his &s;piritual conflicts about the time of his appearing fir&s;t in a public te&s;timony.</P>
<P>In her family, &s;he was an example of piety and indu&s;try, ri&s;ing early in the morning,

and encouraging others &s;o to do, often ob&s;erv|ing that tho&s;e who lay late, lo&s;t the youthful beauty of the day, and wa&s;ted the mo&s;t precious part of their time; that the &s;un was the candle of the world, which called upon us to ari&s;e and apply to our &s;everal duties. When the affairs of the morning were tran&s;acted it was almo&s;t her invaria|ble practice, except on meeting days, to retire about noon, with the bible or &s;ome religious book; where a portion of her time was &s;pent alone; from which retirement &s;he often returned with evident tokens, that her eyes had been bathed in tears.</P>
<P>She was remarkably well acquainted with the holy &s;criptures, as al&s;o the writings and characters of our ancient worthy friends, together with tho&s;e of her own time; fre|quently expre&s;&s;ing,
<Q>The many advantages &s;he reaped from often conver&s;ing with the dead and ab&s;ent; endeavouring to cultivate the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition in her family, by often calling them together in the winter even|ings, and requiring one of her children to read audibly in the bible or &s;ome other reli|gious book;</Q>

from her infancy as brethren and &s;i&s;ters in go&s;pel fellow&s;hip) in the cour&s;e of their vi&s;its came this way, generally lodged at their hou&s;e, at which times &s;he &s;eldom mi&s;&s;|ed to prepare her family, and inform the neighbourhood of an intention to &s;it a while together in the evening; which &s;elect oppor|tunities, many can yet remember, were of|ten &s;ingularly ble&s;&s;ed with divine comfort and edification.</P>
<P>Her diligence in attending meetings for religious wor&s;hip, was no le&s;s manife&s;t than her &s;teady zeal for &s;upporting our chri&s;tian di&s;cipline, and that we might adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things: Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was her zeal mixed with charity, for b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing long experienced how few were qualified to lay ju&s;tice preci&s;ely to the line and righteou&s;ne&s;s to the plumbline, &s;he thought it &s;afe&s;t rather to incline to the mer|ciful &s;ide; firmly believing that the grace of God which bringeth &s;alvation, had appeared unto all men; delighting to conver&s;e with our unin&s;tructed Indians about their &s;enti|ments of the &s;upreme being; and often &s;aid,

<Q>That if God whom &s;he loved all her life long, had not enabled her to &s;u&s;tain it, &s;he mu&s;t have &s;unk under it.</Q>
This di&s;pen&s;ation of providence weaned her from all tempo|ral enjoyments.

<P>The early &s;tate of religion in this pro|vince was a grateful &s;ubject of conver&s;ati|on to her in the evening of her day, but upon turning her eye to the pre&s;ent time, &s;he would &s;ay with a deep &s;igh,
<Q>Oh! what is become of the morning dew and cele&s;ti|al rain, that u&s;ed to fall and re&s;t upon our a&s;&s;emblies.</Q>
For her&s;elf, &s;he often prayed,

<P>Her la&s;t illne&s;s began about a year before her decea&s;e, in the forepart thereof &s;he felt a lowne&s;s and depre&s;&s;ion of mind, that cau&s;|ed her to cry,
<Q>Tell me, Oh! thou whom my &s;oul loveth, where thou feede&s;t, where thou make&s;t thy flocks to re&s;t at noon.</Q>
But after &s;ome time, this cloud was remov|ed,

and &s;he was enabled to &s;ay,

<P>And thus, by remembring her creator in the days of her youth, and a &s;teady per&s;e|verance therein, &s;he was enabled to meet the king of terrors with a &s;erene counte|nance, and re&s;igned her breath without a &s;igh or groan, the 29<HI>th</HI> day of the fourth month, and was buried at Gwynedd, the 2<HI>d</HI> of the fifth month 1765; being, we tru&s;t, admitted to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t born, which are written in heaven.</P>

He was religiou&s;ly inclined when young, in&s;omuch (as he related) that at times he thought he could freely declare to others of the goodne&s;s and merciful deal|ings of God to his &s;oul; but for want of giving diligent heed to the in&s;hinings of that divine light which had mea&s;urably

redeemed him, he &s;uffered a lo&s;s of that &s;weet and heavenly communion which he had been made a &s;harer of, and began to join with folly and vanity, which youth are apt to do; but in proce&s;s of time, being revi&s;ited by an all-merciful God, he gave up to bear the cro&s;s; and about the thirtieth year of his age, was made willing to bear a public te&s;timony, and declare to others what God had done for him; which te&s;ti|mony was living and powerful, and tended to the refre&s;hing and watering the Lord's heritage and people; being often concern'd where his lot was ca&s;t, to invite and per|&s;uade people to &s;eek the Lord for them|&s;elves, that they might know the work of regeneration wrought and compleated in and for them&s;elves. He freely gave up to &s;pend both time and &s;ub&s;tance on truth's account when called thereto, having vi&s;ited &s;everal provinces on this continent, and &s;ome of them divers times. He was a ge|nerous kind friend, ready to do good to all, e&s;pecially the hou&s;ehold of faith, very ready in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the &s;ervants and me&s;&s;engers of Chri&s;t when travelling on that account; bringing up his children in the principles of the chri&s;tian religion, and in plainne&s;s of &s;peech and apparel, a great encourager of his family and others in attending meet|ings, that they might di&s;charge their du|ties which they owed to their maker. In the latter part of his days, when old and infirm, he met with exerci&s;es and difficul|ties,

He had a &s;ight of his approaching exit, and gave orders that his burial &s;hould be plain. Some of the la&s;t words he utter'd, were to his wife, a few hours before he expired, when he &s;aid,

<P>OUR worthy friend William Mott, of Mamaroneck in New-York govern|ment, being on a religious vi&s;it to friends in this province; after attending our yearly-meeting at Philadelphia, intended proceeding to Nottingham, and on his way thither, was at our mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly-meeting in the tenth month 1765; where, after a time of &s;ilence, he ap|peared in a &s;hort yet &s;atisfactory te&s;timony; but being much indi&s;po&s;ed, left the meet|ing in a few minutes afterwards, and went to a friend's hou&s;e, where his di&s;order, which proved to be the &s;mall pox, increa&s;ed and lay heavy upon him.

mention'd his de&s;ire of having a time of retirement together, in which opportunity he expre&s;s'd in a lively and &s;en&s;ible manner, his re&s;ignation to the will of God re&s;pecting his indi&s;po&s;ition, and &s;poke of the great ad|vantage it would be to the members of our &s;ociety, if they were more drawn from the &s;pirit and friend&s;hip of the world, and the eager pur&s;uit after the riches and grandeur thereof; &s;aying, that the profe&s;&s;ors of truth &s;uffered great lo&s;s in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, for want of being often deeply inward, when about their lawful callings, labouring to have their minds retired, where true com|fort and in&s;truction is to be witne&s;&s;ed; and that friends who are heads of families, ought to wait for the movings of truth, to make way for them to call their children and &s;ervants together; and if this was but the engagement of their minds, way would be made for &s;uch opportunities beyond their expectation.

<P>At other times he frequently mention'd his unea&s;ine&s;s in beholding, that many of the profe&s;&s;ors of truth did not keep within the bounds of true moderation re&s;pecting cloathing and furniture, but rather plea&s;ed the natural di&s;po&s;ition, to no real advantage, and con&s;umed much precious time that might be profitably &s;pent in doing good among mankind; &s;aying, that if friends lived near enough to the inward teacher

that di&s;covers things to be as they really are; there are many things among&s;t us termed &s;mall or trifling, which would ap|pear incon&s;i&s;tent with the pure truth.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his affliction was great, yet he bore it with remarkable patience, ap|pearing more concern'd for the glory of God and the good of his church and people, than any temporal con&s;iderations: And fre|quently expre&s;s'd his re&s;ignation to the di|vine will, being freely given up either for life or death. The retired frame of mind he generally appeared in, was in&s;tructive; often &s;aying he felt ea&s;y in mind, having witne&s;&s;ed a comfortable refre&s;hing &s;ea&s;on, and expre&s;s'd his thankfulne&s;s for &s;uch pe|culiar favour in &s;o trying a di&s;pen&s;ation: Yet he had no other pro&s;pect but that he &s;hould recover, until a few hours before his decea&s;e, when he &s;ignified,

And changing fa&s;t, he quietly departed, the 15<HI>th</HI> of the tenth month 1765, in a &s;en&s;ible compo&s;ed frame of &s;pirit. On the 17<HI>th</HI> his corp&s;e, accom|panied by many friends, was interr'd in friends burying-ground in New-Garden, after a &s;olid meeting.</P>

<HEAD>A Te&s;timony from the Quarterly-Meeting of <HI>Phi|ladelphia,</HI> concerning our e&s;teemed friend <HI>MARGARET ELLIS,</HI> late of <HI>Radnor</HI> meet|ing, decea&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>SHE was born in the principality of Wales, of parents profe&s;&s;ing epi&s;copacy, and religious in that way. By a &s;hort me|morial &s;he hath left, of &s;ome occurrences in her life, we find, &s;he was early vi&s;ited by the almighty, which &s;he expre&s;&s;es in this manner.
<Q>At fourteen years of age, the call of the Lord was to me, when &s;eeing &s;ome of my companions carri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the grave, a concern came over my mind, with a con&s;ideration, whither their &s;ouls were gone, and where mine would be, if I &s;hould then be taken away; and that followed and remained with me for many days:</Q>
But being young and not willing to bear the cro&s;s, the witne&s;s for God was &s;o far &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, that &s;he gave way to fol|low the vanities and diver&s;ions of the world; yet the Lord did not forget her; but &s;ome years after, the vi&s;itation was renewed, and then, &s;he &s;ays,
<Q>I returned in earne&s;t to look within, to my own &s;tate and con|dition, and to the anointing mentioned by the apo&s;tle John, which opened clearly in my mind.</Q>
This brought her to a clo&s;e exerci&s;e, and often in &s;ecret prayer, that the Lord would be plea&s;ed to manife&s;t her duty. Soon after this, &s;he went to vi&s;it a
<PB N="244" REF="020377_0251_0FAF07A90BE6B120">
brother at Dolobran, who had a &s;hort time before joined in communion with friends; and being at a meeting, &s;he was further reached unto, and the thoughts of her heart declared by a worthy mini&s;ter then pre&s;ent. Her father took pains to di&s;&s;uade her from joining friends, and got &s;everal prie&s;ts to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their endeavours, but being enlightened to &s;ee the formality and dead|ne&s;s of the profe&s;&s;ion of religion in which &s;he had been educated, and the blindne&s;s and emptine&s;s of their prie&s;ts, &s;he aquaint|ed her father,
<Q>She would never come more to their church, unle&s;s it was to his and her mother's burial.</Q></P>
<P>In a few years after this, &s;he found a con|cern to appear in public te&s;timony in friends meetings, and &s;oon afterwards removed to this province; in which &s;he apprehended a divine direction, believing the Lord would go along with her, which &s;he experienced to her comfort, and was cordially received by friends; increa&s;ing in the gift be&s;towed on her.</P>

<P>She was a &s;incere hearted woman, diligent in the exerci&s;e of her gift, which was in much plainne&s;s and &s;implicity. She vi&s;ited the meetings frequently in &s;ome parts of this province and New-Jer&s;ey; and in the

year 1752, with the concurrence of friends, embarked in order to vi&s;it friends in &s;ome parts of Great-Britain, which &s;he perform|ed, and was in &s;everal places engaged to vi|&s;it many of the families of friends; which as we have under&s;tood, were acceptable and &s;er|viceable. She was favoured to return, and continued lively in the exerci&s;e of her gift.</P>
<P>Being taken ill in Philadelphia, in the eleventh month 1765, immediately after our quarterly-meeting which &s;he attended, after a few days illne&s;s, &s;he departed this life. She had divers times, to her particular friends, expre&s;&s;ed her de&s;ire, if it was the Lord's will, to fini&s;h her days in this city; and in her &s;ickne&s;s expre&s;&s;ed her willingne&s;s to depart, but reque&s;ted &s;he might be fa|voured with &s;ome interval of ea&s;e from ex|treme pain, that &s;he might take her leave of her friends, which was granted her. She uttered many lively and &s;avoury expre&s;&s;ions in her &s;ickne&s;s, was favoured with an evi|dence of her future well-being, and as &s;he lived in the fear of God, we doubt not &s;he was accepted of him, and enjoys the reward of her faithfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>She died the 13<HI>th</HI> of the eleventh month 1765, in a good old age; her body was car|ried to our meeting-hou&s;e in High-Street, and after a &s;olid meeting, buried the 15<HI>th</HI> in friends grave-yard.</P>

<HEAD>A Te&s;timony from <HI>Nottingham</HI> Monthly-Meet|ing in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>DINAH JAMES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SHE was born the 7<HI>th</HI> of the &s;ixth month 1699, near Che&s;ter, in the county of Che&s;ter in Penn&s;ylvania. When &s;he was about five years old, her parents John and Hannah Churchman, removed and &s;ettled at Nottingham, in the county afore&s;aid; and &s;he being religiou&s;ly educated by them, &s;oon became inwardly &s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ed truth; and taking heed to its teaching, was early a|dorned thereby with a meek and quiet &s;pirit; was a great lover of meetings for the wor|&s;hip of God, and a humble exemplary wait|er therein. About the thirty-fourth year of her age &s;he appeared in the mini&s;try, and being faithful in her gift, though &s;he did not increa&s;e in many words, and but &s;eldom appeared therein, being rather a pattern of awful &s;ilence, yet her te&s;timony when &s;he did appear, was remarkably &s;ea&s;oned with the bapti&s;ing power of the &s;pirit, which made it truly acceptable to friends. She was often heard to expre&s;s her apprehen&s;ion of the danger of words increa&s;ing in the church, without &s;ufficient weight and aw|fulne&s;s; and at different times, e&s;pecially in the latter years of her life, both in pub|lic te&s;timony and in private, &s;he &s;poke of a winnowing time at hand, wherein &s;he ap|prehended the chaff was to be blown away,

and the church re&s;tored to as great, if not a greater degree of purity than heretofore; which is now fre&s;h in the memory of divers per&s;ons.</P>
<P>She was an example of plainne&s;s her&s;elf, and careful prudently to &s;uppre&s;s the con|trary in her children, as long as they re|mained under her immediate care, meekly di&s;&s;uading in a moving manner, again&s;t any appearance of corruption in conver&s;ation, as well as the world's vain fa&s;hions and &s;u|perfluity in dre&s;s; firmly maintaining pa|rental authority in this &s;teady re&s;olution which &s;he never departed from, viz. that while her children were clothed at her ex|pence, they &s;hould &s;ubmit to have their clothes fa&s;hioned agreeable to her mind. She was no le&s;s remarkable for humility and charity, a promoter of good order in the church, and of true peace upon the right foundation; for which virtues &s;he gained the general e&s;teem of her friends and others.</P>
<P>Between the years 1742 and 1754, &s;he vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings of friends in Penn&s;ylvania, New-Jer&s;ey, Long-I&s;land and the Ea&s;tern-&s;hore of Maryland. Her care to attend meetings was memorable and worthy of imitation, even when under great bodily weakne&s;s and infirmity, as &s;he was for ma|ny years in the latter part of her life, &s;e|veral of her joints being greatly affected with the violence of rheumatic pains; all which &s;he bore with &s;uch patience and hum|ble re&s;ignation of mind, as truly becomes a

<P>She was at meeting a few weeks before her decea&s;e, but feeling much bodily weak|ne&s;s, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her doubt of ever coming again; having at divers times before mani|fe&s;ted a &s;en&s;e of her end being near. About five days before her decea&s;e &s;he was &s;eized with a fever and inward pains, which weak|ened her very fa&s;t.

<P>He often &s;ounded an alarm to the rebel|lious and gain&s;ayers, with a warning to re|pent and amend their ways, that their &s;ouls might be &s;aved in the day of trouble.

<P>HE was born in Rhode-I&s;land, of hone&s;t parents, who died whil&s;t he was young, from which time until he came to man's e&s;tate, we have no account of him, only that &s;ome of us have heard him &s;ay, he was much delighted with mirth and vanity. Soon after his arrival at manhood, he came into New-Jer&s;ey, where he married, and &s;ettled at Eve&s;ham; not long afterwards he was convinced, and effectually reached with the power of truth, through the living mi|ni&s;try of that eminent mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Thomas Wil&s;on; and by the operati|on of divine grace in his heart, he gradually experienced a growth therein. Thus ad|vancing in true obedience, he witne&s;&s;ed an overcoming of his own &s;trong will (as &s;ome of us have heard him relate with awful gratitude to the divine hand) and in due time he became a father and elder in the church; being tenderly concerned for the promotion of the truth, which had in mea|&s;ure &s;et him free from the body of &s;in and death, communicating &s;uitable advice and coun&s;el to &s;uch as were tender, and a &s;harp reprover of ob&s;tinate &s;inners; his advice being much enforced by his upright uni|form conduct.</P>

He was of a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, his heart and hou&s;e being open to entertain &s;trangers, e&s;pecially travelling friends; nor was his benevolence confined to tho&s;e of our own &s;ociety; for, being ble&s;&s;ed with afflu|ence, many widows and fatherle&s;s received his hearty a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>He was born in this city, in the year 1708, and his father dying before his birth, and his mother a few years after, he &s;uffer|ed great trials and hard&s;hips when very young: Being early concerned to &s;eek the knowledge of God, he had a fervent de&s;ire to attend religious meetings, though &s;ub|jected to many difficulties and di&s;courage|ments, before that privilege was allowed him; yet, being earne&s;t in his de&s;ires to ob|tain divine favour, he was eminently &s;up|ported

<P>He was very exemplary in his indu&s;try and diligence, in labouring faithfully at his trade, to provide for his own &s;upport, and after he married, and had children, for their maintenance; and was often concerned to advi&s;e others to the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ary care; yet he continued fervent in &s;pirit for the promotion of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o that he was &s;oon engaged to leave home, and the neare&s;t connections of nature, to publi&s;h the glad tidings of the go&s;pel, and frequently vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings of friends in this and the adjacent provinces, and &s;everal times as far as the ea&s;tern parts of New-England.

<P>His concern to travel in the &s;ervice of truth continuing, and the meeting having full unity with him therein, he embarked in the fifth month 1748, accompanied by our dear friend, Samuel Nottingham, in a ve&s;&s;el bound for Barbados, and having vi|&s;ited the few meetings in that i&s;land, they went by way of Antigua to Tortola, where they continued &s;ometime, having &s;ome dif|ficulty to get a pa&s;&s;age to Europe; and their voyage thither was attended with &s;ome &s;in|gular hazards and dangers, which occa&s;ion|ed their landing in Ireland; where our friend Daniel continued &s;ome months, vi&s;iting the meetings of friends in that kingdom; and after he apprehended him&s;elf clear, went over to England, and vi&s;ited the meetings generally in that nation, and in Wales and Scotland, where his meek circum&s;pect con|duct and conver&s;ation, and lively edifying mini&s;try, rendered his vi&s;it very acceptable, and his memory precious.</P>
<P>In his return home, and for &s;ometime af|ter, he was in a low afflicted &s;tate of mind; being apprehen&s;ive, that through diffidence, and the want of perfect re&s;ignation to the divine will, he had omitted fully perform|ing

<P>He &s;everal times, with other friends ap|pointed to that &s;ervice, vi&s;ited the families of friends in this city, and between the years 1757 and 1760, being accompanied by our friend John Pemberton, he vi&s;ited the families of friends generally within the limits of our meeting; which weighty ex|erci&s;ing &s;ervice, he was enabled to perform to our edification and &s;atisfaction.

<P>His chief labour and religious exerci&s;es were in this city, where he was a diligent attender of all our meetings, and often on committees appointed on the &s;ervices of the church; in which he was &s;olid and weighty in &s;pirit, waiting for the &s;pringing up of life, being &s;teadily concerned both in and out of meetings, to live near the divine foun|tain: Thus he was very frequently qualifi|ed, and enabled to &s;tir up the pure mind, and to recount the gracious dealings of God to mankind, and as a faithful emba&s;&s;ador to warn the negligent to flee from the wrath to come, and to excite the people to bring forth fruits an&s;werable to the great mercies graciou&s;ly be&s;towed on us; and was &s;ome|times con&s;trained to declare in a prophetic manner, a day of trial, in divers in&s;tances, very &s;hortly before &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on came to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>He was of late deeply exerci&s;ed in con|&s;ideration of the evils of the hor&s;e races, &s;tage plays, drunkenne&s;s, and other gro&s;s enormities encouraged and increa&s;ing in this city; clo&s;ely exhorting our youth again&s;t tho&s;e pernicious and de&s;tructive devices of the enemy of mankind; and under the aw|ful &s;en&s;e that God will judge and puni&s;h the wicked and evil doers, he was often fervent in public &s;upplications, that the Lord would lengthen out the day of his merciful vi&s;itati|on,

<P>His love for the ri&s;ing generation was ve|ry great; which he manife&s;ted by his affec|tionate notice of them, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who were religiou&s;ly inclined, and his hou&s;e was open to receive &s;uch, his conver|&s;ation with them being &s;ea&s;oned with grace, and his coun&s;el in&s;tructive and helpful to tho&s;e who had &s;eeking de&s;ires after the knowledge of truth, often lovingly inviting them to come, ta&s;te, and &s;ee, that the Lord is good; greatly de&s;iring, that all who pro|fe&s;s the truth, might walk agreeable to its dictates and be led thereby, as our worthy predece&s;&s;ors were, into that meekne&s;s, hu|mility, and godly &s;implicity and plainne&s;s, which rendered them con&s;picuous and &s;hi|ning examples, and that none might re&s;t &s;hort of the enjoyment of the life or religi|on, his zeal being great again&s;t &s;uch, who have the form of godline&s;s, and by their actions manife&s;t they have not the power thereof; and he often fervently advis'd and cautioned tho&s;e who are eagerly pur&s;uing the world, and by the &s;urfeiting cares, and gra&s;ping after earthly trea&s;ures, fru&s;trate the good purpo&s;e of the vi&s;itation of divine grace to them, and clo&s;ely reminded tho&s;e, who

in their &s;mall beginnings were low and hum|ble, that now they were abundantly favour|ed, they &s;hould not &s;et their affections on things below, but remember the rock from whence they were hewn; and his concern was great that tho&s;e who had the glad tidings of the go&s;pel to publi&s;h, might be true ex|amples to the flock, and adorn the doctrine they had to deliver by a circum&s;pect life and conver&s;ation, and where any by not &s;teadily keeping to that which would have pre&s;erved them, had involved them&s;elves in difficulties, either by letting their minds out to the gains and profits of this world, or otherwi&s;e, his travail was great for &s;uch that they might be brought through, and every cloud and mi&s;t removed.</P>
<P>He was much employed in vi&s;iting the &s;ick and afflicted, to whom he admini&s;tered his &s;piritual advice and experience, and of|ten engaged in humble prayer for their &s;up|port; and in the di&s;tributing to the nece&s;&s;it|ous according to his circum&s;tances, he ma|nife&s;ted his benevolent di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<P>They arrived in London about a week af|ter the yearly-meeting 1771, and attending &s;everal meetings in that city, proceeded northward, vi&s;iting friends in divers coun|ties in England, and al&s;o in Scotland. The en&s;uing winter was &s;pent in vi&s;iting York|&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire and Ireland, returning to London in time to attend the yearly-meet|ing there in 1772; then attending the year|ly-meetings in E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk and Norfolk, and proceeding through Lincoln&s;hire to Hull, they took &s;hipping for Holland, and after vi&s;iting the few friends there, they embarked for Scarborough, but by contrary winds landed at Shields, the 25<HI>th</HI> of the eighth month, and after being at their meet|ing on the 26<HI>th</HI> came that afternoon to the hou&s;e of a friend near New-Ca&s;tle upon Tyne.</P>

He was a man of &s;ound judgment, quick of apprehen&s;ion, and deep in religious ex|perience; and altho' he was only in the thirty-ninth year of his age, yet &s;uch was his experience and &s;tability, that he &s;tood as an elder and a father in the church, worthy of double honour.</P>
<P>He attended the meeting at New-Ca&s;tle, on the 27<HI>th</HI> of the eighth month 1772, in which he delivered a &s;hort and living te&s;timony in the love of the go&s;pel to his friends of that place; that afternoon he was cheerful, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction in being there, and upon being a&s;ked what place they intended for next, he replied, he &s;aw no further at pre&s;ent than New-Ca&s;tle.

At another time he made the &s;ame remark to a friend, &s;ay|ing,
<Q>It will be a &s;ore trial to my compani|on if I am now removed.</Q>

<P>On the third day of his illne&s;s, two friends from the country came to vi&s;it him, to whom he thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, viz.
<Q>I have longed to &s;ee you and be with you, but was put by,</Q>

of religious parents, who in&s;tructed him very early in the principles of the chri&s;tian religi|on, as profe&s;&s;ed by the people called Quakers, which he e&s;teemed a ble&s;&s;ing to him, even in his young years, tending to pre&s;erve him from the infection of wicked children; but through the workings of the enemy, and le|vity incident to youth, he frequently deviated from tho&s;e parental precepts, by which he laid a renewed foundation for repentance, that was finally &s;ucceeded by a godly &s;orrow not to be repented of, and &s;o became ac|quainted with that &s;anctifying power which qualifies for true go&s;pel mini&s;try, into which he was called about the twenty-&s;econd year of his age, and by a faithful u&s;e of the ta|lents committed to him, he experienced an increa&s;e, until he arrived at the &s;tate of a fa|ther, capable of dividing the word aright to the different &s;tates he mini&s;tered unto; di&s;|pen&s;ing. milk to babes, and meat to tho&s;e of riper years. Thus he found the efficacy of that power to ari&s;e, which in his own ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
<Q>Prepares the creature to &s;tand like a trumpet through which the Lord &s;peaks to his people.</Q>
He was a loving hu&s;band, a tender father, and very humane to every part of the creation under his care.</P>
<P>His concern for the poor and tho&s;e in af|fliction was evident by his vi&s;its to them; whom he frequently relieved by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and charity. He was for many years deeply exerci&s;ed on account of the poor en&s;laved A|fricans, who&s;e cau&s;e, as he &s;ometimes men|tioned,

lay almo&s;t continually upon him, and to obtain liberty to tho&s;e captives, he la|boured both in public and private; and was favoured to &s;ee his endeavours crowned with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. He was particularly de&s;irous that friends &s;hould not be in&s;tru|mental to lay burthens on this oppre&s;&s;ed peo|ple, but remember the days of &s;uffering from which they had been providentially delivered, that if times of trouble &s;hould return, no in|ju&s;tice dealt to tho&s;e in &s;lavery might ri&s;e in judgment again&s;t us, but, being clear, we might on &s;uch occa&s;ions addre&s;s the Almigh|ty with a degree of confidence, for his inter|po&s;ition and relief, being particularly careful as to him&s;elf, not to countenance &s;lavery even by the u&s;e of tho&s;e conveniencies of life which were furni&s;hed by their labour.</P>
<P>He was de&s;irous to have his own, and the minds of others, redeemed from the plea&s;ures, and immoderate profits of this world, and to fix them on tho&s;e joys which fade not away; his principal care being after a life of purity, endeavouring to avoid not only the gro&s;&s;er pollutions, but tho&s;e al&s;o which, appearing in a more refined dre&s;s, are not &s;ufficiently guarded again&s;t by &s;ome well di&s;po&s;ed peo|ple. In the latter part of his life he was re|markable for the plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of his dre&s;s, and as much as po&s;&s;ible, avoided the u&s;e of plate, co&s;tly furniture and fea&s;ting; thereby endeavouring to become an example of temperance and &s;elf-denial, which, he be|lieved him&s;elf called unto; and was favour|ed

with peace therein, altho' it carried the appearance of great au&s;terity in the view of &s;ome. He was very moderate in his charges in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s, and in his de&s;ires af|ter gain; and tho' a man of indu&s;try, avoid|ed, and &s;trove much to lead others out of ex|treme labour, and anxiou&s;ne&s;s after peri&s;ha|ble things; being de&s;irous that the &s;trength of our bodies might not be &s;pent in procuring things unprofitable, and that we might u&s;e moderation and kindne&s;s to the brute ani|mals under our care, to prize the u&s;e of them as a great favour, and by no means abu&s;e them; that the gifts of Providence &s;hould be thankfully received and applied to the u&s;es they were de&s;igned.</P>
<P>He &s;everal times opened a &s;chool at Mount-Holly, for the in&s;truction of poor friends children and others, being concerned for their help and improvement therein: His love and care for the ri&s;ing youth among us was truly great, recommending to parents and tho&s;e who have the charge of them, to chu&s;e con&s;cientious and pious tutors, &s;aying,
<Q>It is a lovely &s;ight to behold innocent chil|dren,</Q>
and that
<Q>To labour for their help again&s;t that which would marr the beauty of their minds, is a debt we owe them.</Q></P>
<P>His mini&s;try was &s;ound, very deep and penetrating, &s;ometimes pointing out the dan|gerous &s;ituation which indulgence and cu&s;|tom leads into; frequently exhorting others, e&s;pecially the youth, not to be di&s;couraged at the difficulties which occur, but pre&s;s af|ter

purity. He often expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t en|gagement that pure wi&s;dom &s;hould be at|tended to, which would lead into lowline&s;s of mind and re&s;ignation to the divine will, in which &s;tate &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions here would be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>In tran&s;acting the affairs of di&s;cipline, his judgment was &s;ound and clear, and he was very u&s;eful in treating with tho&s;e who had done ami&s;s; he vi&s;ited &s;uch in a private way in that plainne&s;s which truth dictates, &s;hewing great tenderne&s;s and chri&s;tian for|bearance. He was a con&s;tant attender of our yearly-meeting, in which he was a good ex|ample, and particularly u&s;eful; a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the bu&s;ine&s;s thereof with great weight and at|tention. He &s;everal times vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings of friends in this and the neigh|bouring provinces, with the concurrence of the monthly-meeting to which he belonged, and we have rea&s;on to believe had good &s;er|vice therein, generally or always expre&s;&s;ing at his return how it had fared with him, and the evidence of peace in his mind for thus performing his duty. He was often concern|ed with other friends in the important &s;er|vice of vi&s;iting families, which he was ena|bled to go through to &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>In the twelfth month 1771, he acquainted this meeting that he found his mind drawn towards a religious vi&s;it to friends in &s;ome parts of England, particularly in York&s;hire. In the fir&s;t month 1772, he obtained our cer|tificate, which was approved and endor&s;ed by our quarterly-meeting, and by the half year's meeting of mini&s;ters and elders at Philadelphia. He embarked on his voyage in the fifth and arrived in London in the &s;ixth month following, at the time of their annual meeting in that city. During his &s;hort vi&s;it to friends in that kingdom, we are informed that his &s;ervices were accepta|ble and edifying.

<HEAD>A Te&s;timony from the Quarterly-Meeting at <HI>York</HI> in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> concerning <HI>JOHN WOOLMAN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS our valuable friend having been under a religious engagement for &s;ome time, to vi&s;it friends in this nation, and more e&s;pecially us in the northern parts, undertook the &s;ame in full concurrence and near &s;ympathy with his friends and bre|thren at home, as appeared by certificates from the monthly and quarterly-meetings to which he belonged, and from the &s;pring-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, held at Philadelphia, for Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="020377_0315_0FAF06912F6D76D8">He arrived in the city of London the be|ginning of the la&s;t yearly-meeting, and after attending that meeting travelled northward, vi&s;iting the quarterly-meetings of Hertford|&s;hire, Buckingham&s;hire, Northampton&s;hire, Oxford&s;hire and Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and divers particular meetings in his way.</P>
<P>He vi&s;ited many meetings on the we&s;t-&s;ide of this county, al&s;o &s;ome in Lanca&s;hire and We&s;tmoreland, from whence he came to our quarterly-meeting in the la&s;t ninth month, and though much out of health, yet was en|abled to attend all the &s;ittings of that meet|ing except the la&s;t.</P>
<P>His di&s;order then, which proved the &s;mall-pox, increa&s;ed &s;peedily upon him, and was very afflicting; under which he was &s;upport|ed in much meekne&s;s, patience, and chri&s;ti|an fortitude; to tho&s;e who attended him in his illne&s;s, his mind appeared to be centered in divine love; under the precious influence whereof, we believe he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, and entered into the man&s;ions of everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the early part of his illne&s;s he reque&s;ted a friend to write and he broke forth thus.</P>
<P><Q>O Lord my God! the amazing horrors of darkne&s;s were gathered around me and covered me all over, and I &s;aw no way to go forth; I felt the mi&s;ery of my fellow creatures &s;eparated from the divine har|mony and it was heavier than I could bear, and I was cru&s;hed down under it; I lifted up my hand, and &s;tretched out my
<PB N="309" REF="020377_0316_0FAF0694CE046CB8">
arm, but there was none to help me; I looked round about and was amazed: In the depths of mi&s;ery, O Lord! I remem|bred that thou art omnipotent, that I had called thee father, and I felt that I loved thee, and I was made quiet in thy will, and I waited for deliverance from thee; thou had&s;t pity upon me, when no man could help me; I &s;aw that meekne&s;s under &s;uffering was &s;hewed to us in the mo&s;t af|fecting example of thy &s;on, and thou wa&s;t teaching me to follow him, and I &s;aid, thy will O father, be done.</Q></P>
<P>Many more of his weighty expre&s;&s;ions might have been in&s;erted here, but it was deemed unnece&s;&s;ary, they being already publi&s;hed in print.</P>
<P>He was a man endued with a large natu|ral capacity, and being obedient to the ma|nife&s;tations of divine grace, having in pati|ence and humility endured many deep bap|ti&s;ms, he became thereby &s;anctified and fitted for the Lord's work, and was truly &s;ervice|able in his church; dwelling in awful fear and watchfulne&s;s, he was careful in his pub|lic appearances to feel the putting forth of the divine hand, &s;o that the &s;pring of the go&s;pel mini&s;try often flowed through him with great &s;weetne&s;s and purity, as a refre&s;h|ing &s;tream to the weary travellers towards the city of God: Skilful in dividing the word, he was furni&s;hed by him in whom are hid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and know|ledge, to communicate freely to the &s;everal
<PB N="310" REF="020377_0317_0FAF0695D7A2A0F0">
&s;tates of the people where his lot was ca&s;t. His conduct at other times was &s;ea&s;oned with the like watchful circum&s;pection and attention to the guidance of divine wi&s;dom, which rendered his whole conver&s;ation uni|formly edifying.</P>
<P>He was fully per&s;uaded that as the life of Chri&s;t comes to reign in the earth, all abu&s;e and unnece&s;&s;ary oppre&s;&s;ion, both of the hu|man and brute creation will come to an end; but under the &s;en&s;e of a deep revolt, and an overflowing &s;tream of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, his life has been often a life of mourning.</P>
<P>He was deeply concerned on account of that inhuman and iniquitous practice of making &s;laves of the people of Africa, or holding them in that &s;tate; and on that ac|count we under&s;tand he hath not only wrote &s;ome books, but travelled much on the con|tinent of America, in order to make the Ne|gro ma&s;ters (e&s;pecially tho&s;e in profe&s;&s;ion with us) &s;en&s;ible of the evil of &s;uch a prac|tice; and though in this journey to England, he was far removed from the outward &s;ight of their &s;ufferings, yet his deep exerci&s;e of mind remained, as appears by a &s;hort trea|ti&s;e he wrote in this journey, and his fre|quent concern to open the mi&s;erable &s;tate of this deeply injured people: His te&s;timony in the la&s;t meeting he attended was on this &s;ub|ject, wherein he remarked, that as we as a &s;ociety, when under outward &s;ufferings, had often found it our concern to lay them before tho&s;e in authority, and thereby in

the Lord's time, had obtained relief, &s;o he recommended this oppre&s;&s;ed part of the cre|ation to our notice, that we may as way may open, repre&s;ent their &s;ufferings in an individual, if not a &s;ociety, capacity to tho&s;e in authority.</P>
<P>Deeply &s;en&s;ible that the de&s;ire to gratify people's inclinations in luxury and &s;uperflui|ties, is the principal ground of oppre&s;&s;ion, and the occa&s;ion of many unnece&s;&s;ary wants, he believed it to be his duty to be a pattern of great &s;elf-denial, with re&s;pect to the things of this life, and earne&s;tly to labour with friends in the meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, to im|pre&s;s on their minds the great importance of our te&s;timony in the&s;e things, recommending to the guidance of the ble&s;&s;ed truth in this and all other concerns, and cautioning &s;uch as are experienced therein, again&s;t contenting them&s;elves with acting up to the &s;tandard of others, but to be careful to make the &s;tand|ard of truth manife&s;ted to them, the mea&s;ure of their obedience; for &s;aid he,
<Q>That pu|rity of life which proceeds from faithful|ne&s;s in following the &s;pirit of truth, that &s;tate where our minds are devoted to &s;erve God, and all our wants are bounded by his wi&s;dom; this habitation has often, been opened before me as a place of re|tirement for the children of the light, where they may &s;tand &s;eparated from that which di&s;ordereth and confu&s;eth the affairs of &s;ociety, and where we may have a te&s;ti|mony of our innocence in the hearts of tho&s;e who behold us.</Q></P>

<P>FOURTH-DAY morning, 30<HI>th</HI> of the ninth month 1772, being a&s;ked how he felt him&s;elf, he meekly an&s;wered, I don't know that I have &s;lept this night, I feel the di&s;order making its progre&s;s, but my mind is mercifully pre&s;erved in &s;tillne&s;s and peace: Sometime after he &s;aid he was &s;en&s;ible the pains of death mu&s;t be hard to bear, but if he e&s;caped them now, he mu&s;t &s;ometime pa&s;s thro' them, and he did not know that he could be better prepared, but had no will in it. He &s;aid he had &s;ettled his outward af|fairs to his mind, had taken leave of his wife and family as never to return, leaving them to the divine protection; adding, and tho' I feel them near to me at this time, yet I free|ly give them up, having a hope that they

will be provided for. And a little after &s;aid, This trial is made ea&s;ier than I could have thought, my will being wholly taken away; for if I was anxious for the event it would have been harder, but I am not, and my mind enjoys a perfect calm.</P>
<P>In the night a young woman having giv|en him &s;omething to drink, he &s;aid, My child thou &s;eems very kind to me a poor creature, the Lord will reward thee for it. Awhile af|ter he cried out with great earne&s;tne&s;s of &s;pi|rit, Oh my father! my father! and &s;oon af|ter he &s;aid, Oh my father! my father! how comfortable art thou to my &s;oul in this try|ing &s;ea&s;on. Being a&s;ked if he could take a little nouri&s;hment; after &s;ome pau&s;e he re|plied, my child I cannot tell what to &s;ay to it; I &s;eem nearly arrived where my &s;oul &s;hall have re&s;t from all its troubles. After giving in &s;omething to be in&s;erted in his journal, he &s;aid, I believe the Lord will now excu&s;e me from exerci&s;es of this kind; and I &s;ee no work but one which is to be the la&s;t wrought by me in this world, the me&s;&s;enger will come that will relea&s;e me from all the&s;e troubles; but it mu&s;t be in the Lord's time, which I am waiting for. He &s;aid he had laboured to do whatever was required, according to the ability received, in the remembrance of which he had peace; and tho' the di&s;order was &s;trong at times, and would like a whirl|wind come over his mind; yet it had hither|to been kept &s;teady and center'd in everla&s;t|ing love; adding, and if that be mercifully
<PB N="314" REF="020377_0321_0FAF0698E432A5B8">
continued, I a&s;k nor de&s;ire no more. An|other time he &s;aid, he had long had a view of vi&s;iting this nation, and &s;ometime before he came had a dream, in which he &s;aw him&s;elf in the northern parts of it, and that the &s;pring of the go&s;pel was opened in him much as in the beginning of friends, &s;uch as George Fox and William Dew&s;bury, and he &s;aw the different &s;tates of the people, as clear as he had ever&s;een flowers in a garden; but in his going along he was &s;uddenly &s;topt, tho' he could not &s;ee for what end; but looking towards home, fell into a flood of tears, which waked him.</P>
<P>At another time he &s;aid, my draught &s;eem|ed &s;tronge&s;t towards the north, and I men|tioned in my own monthly-meeting, that attending the quarterly-meeting at York, and being there looked like home to me.</P>
<P>Fifth-day night, having repeatedly con|&s;ented to take medicine with a view to &s;ettle his &s;tomach, but without effect; the friend then waiting on him, &s;aid thro' di&s;tre&s;s, what &s;hall I do now? He an&s;wered with great compo&s;ure, Rejoice evermore, and in every thing give thanks; but added a little after, this is &s;ometimes hard to come at.</P>
<P>Sixth-day morning he broke forth early in &s;upplication on this wi&s;e, O Lord it was thy power that enabled me to for&s;ake &s;in in my youth, and I have felt thy brui&s;es for di&s;|obedience; but as I bowed under them thou healed me, continuing a father and a friend; I feel thy power now, and I beg that in the

On her &s;ay|ing &s;he did not doubt that, but could not help mourning to &s;ee &s;o many faithful &s;er|vants removed at &s;o low a time; he &s;aid all good cometh from the Lord, who&s;e power is the &s;ame, and can work as he &s;ees be&s;t. The &s;ame day he had given directions about wrapping his corp&s;e; perceiving a friend to weep, he &s;aid I would rather thou would&s;t guard again&s;t weeping for me, my &s;i&s;ter, I &s;orrow not, tho' I have had &s;ome painful con|flicts, but now they &s;eem over and matters well &s;ettled, and I look at the face of my dear redeemer, for &s;weet is his voice and his countenance is comely.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t-day, 4<HI>th</HI> of the tenth month, being very weak and in general difficult to be un|der&s;tood, he uttered a few words in comme|moration of the Lord's goodne&s;s; and add|ed, how tenderly have I been waited on in this time of affliction, in which I may &s;ay in Job's words, Tedious days and weari&s;ome nights are appointed unto me, and how ma|ny are &s;pending their time and money in vanity and &s;uperfluities, while thou&s;ands

<P>Second-day morning the apothecary who appeared very anxious to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, being pre&s;ent, he queried about the probability of &s;uch a load of matter being thrown off his weak body, and the apothecary making &s;ome remarks implying he thought it might; he &s;poke with an audible voice on this wi&s;e, My dependance is on the Lord Je&s;us, who I tru&s;t will forgive my &s;ins, which is all I hope for, and if it be his will to rai&s;e up this body again, I am content; and if to die, I am re|&s;igned; and if thou can&s;t not be ea&s;y with|out trying to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature, I &s;ubmit.

On the 14<HI>th</HI> of the &s;ame month, he went to the weekday meeting at London-Grove, to meet with a committee of our quarterly-meeting on par|ticular bu&s;ine&s;s, and returned to our meet|ing at Nottingham the next day, on the fir&s;t day of the week following was there al&s;o, in the &s;ame week he attended our preparative and monthly-meetings, but a fever daily in|crea&s;ing upon him, he was afterwards chief|ly confined at home.</P>
<P>On the 4<HI>th</HI> of the &s;eventh month he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus,
<Q>I am glad that I am at home, I have ever found it be&s;t when my &s;ervice abroad was over, to get home as quick as

might be, and though I have felt great in|ward poverty and weakne&s;s &s;ince my la&s;t journey, &s;o that I can neither &s;ee my be|ginning nor ending, but &s;eem as if all were hidden, yet I hope if Providence &s;hall &s;ee meet to remove me at this time, &s;ome light will appear again, and that it will be otherwi&s;e before I go.</Q></P>
<P>At another time he &s;pake to this purpo&s;e,

<Q>I feel that which lives beyond death and the grave, which is now an inexpre&s;&s;ible com|fort to me after a time of deep bapti&s;m that I have pa&s;&s;ed through, I believe my being continued here is in the will of Pro|vidence, and I am fully re&s;igned.</Q></P>

Her tender mind while in her minority, was &s;en&s;ibly reached with a divine vi&s;itation of the love of God, and as &s;he grew to riper years, &s;he was pre&s;erved in a good degree of circum|&s;pect walking in the fear of the Lord; her conver&s;ation being &s;erious, &s;en&s;ible and guarded, and oftentimes her grave deport|ment was u&s;eful as a check to her compani|ons.

<P>He &s;everal times had a concern to vi&s;it the churches abroad, and with the concur|rence of this meeting, vi&s;ited many of the meetings of friends in this and &s;everal of the adjacent provinces, and once through &s;ome parts ot Maryland, Virginia and North-Carolina: And having for &s;ome con&s;idera|ble time been under a weighty concern to pay a religious vi&s;it to friends in &s;everal parts of Europe, he with the concurrence and unity of his friends took &s;hipping for that purpo&s;e in the year 1758, and after a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age landed in England, and having pretty generally vi&s;ited friends meetings in England and Ireland, and &s;ome parts of Wales, he returned to his family and friends, having been from home in truth's &s;ervice near three years: And at his return from

My &s;ins are wa&s;hed away by the blood of the Lamb that was &s;lain from the foundation of the world: All rags and filthine&s;s are taken away, and in room thereof love and good will for all mankind: O that we may become more united in the church mili|tant, and nearer re&s;emble the church triumphant! O that we all might make &s;uch an end as I have in pro&s;pect, for its all light, all life, all love and all peace, the light that I &s;ee is more glorious than the &s;un in the firmament; come Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, come when thou plea&s;es, thy &s;ervant is ready and willing; into thy hands I commit my &s;pirit, not my will, but thy will be done O Lord!

thus he continued the few concluding days, waiting in re&s;ignation and retiredne&s;s of mind, until the repeated returns of the pa|ralytick complaint reduced his faculties and &s;en&s;es &s;o, that he knew not what was done for &s;ome days, and departed in much &s;till|ne&s;s as in a &s;leep, the 10<HI>th</HI> day of the third month 1777, and was decently interr'd in friends burying-ground at the Falls meet|ing-hou&s;e, the 12<HI>th</HI> of the &s;ame; his body being attended to the grave by a number of friends and neighbours.</P>

<P>HE was born in the city of Worce&s;ter, in Old-England, in the year 1686. His parents being of the church of England, educated him in that way during his abode with them, which was until he was about fourteen years of age. In the year 1700 he
<PB N="377" REF="020377_0384_0FAF06D6B6ABBE28">
arrived at Philadelphia, and going into New-Jer&s;ey, there re&s;ided until twenty-one years of age.</P>
<P>He was convinced of the truth about the year 1708, and in 1712 appeared in the mini&s;try, being then in the twenty-&s;ixth year of his age: Having, &s;ince his convince|ment, undergone many &s;ore conflicts, by rea&s;on of a backwardne&s;s to comply with the Lord's requirings whereunto he had di|vers times been di&s;obedient through diffi|dence and weakne&s;s, but at length he gave up, and therein found peace.</P>
<P>After his marriage, he re&s;ided about twelve years at Nottingham, in Che&s;ter coun|ty Penn&s;ylvania, and then removed to Deer-Creek where he continued. He was of an innocent life and harmle&s;s conver&s;ation; and in him were blended tho&s;e truly chri&s;|tian virtues which render religion lovely and de&s;irable; even the irreligious e&s;teemed him an ornament to the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. Being very conver&s;ant in the holy &s;criptures, and favoured with a retentive memory, he was enabled to quote them with propriety, and very often &s;uitably apply them to in|&s;truction and edification.</P>
<P>Divine love, as witne&s;&s;ed by the believers in Chri&s;t, was a &s;ubject upon which he fre|quently expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, in engaging and per&s;ua&s;ive terms; inviting others to come and be made partakers of &s;o glorious a trea|&s;ure; adding,

<Q>Cho&s;en by God, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promi&s;ed to them that love him.</Q>
In this happy &s;ituation he was &s;upported with chri&s;tian fortitude, through times of adver&s;ity and deep affliction.</P>
<P>His wife dying in the ninth month 1777, to whom he had been an affectionate com|panion upwards of &s;ixty years, he did not long &s;urvive her, but, about four months afterwards, was vi&s;ited with his la&s;t illne&s;s, in which he &s;uffered much pain, but was compo&s;ed; &s;ome days before his departure he grew ea&s;y, and in his latter moments, when exhau&s;ted nature &s;carcely left him &s;trength to utter him&s;elf intelligibly, he la|mented the &s;tate of the carele&s;s and uncon|cerned, who did not duly and timely con|&s;ider their latter end.</P>

<P>HE was born (by his own account) in Pembroke&s;hire, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1683, and was in his youth an earne&s;t &s;eeker after righteou&s;ne&s;s among divers forms of religion, until he became mea&s;urably convinced of the prin|ciple of truth as held by friends, by pe|ru&s;ing William Penn's key to chri&s;tian knowledge, before he had much if any out|ward acquaintance with them: And coming over to this country when a young man, he &s;oon after joined with friends in religious fellow&s;hip; and being faithful to the ma|nife&s;tations of divine grace in his heart, he had a gift in the mini&s;try be&s;towed upon him; and tho' not large, was &s;avoury and edifying; which, together with his exem|plary life and conver&s;ation, manife&s;ted him to be an heavenly minded man, much re|deemed from the love and &s;pirit of this world.</P>
<P>He was not anxious about the increa&s;e of outward riches, but ea&s;y and content with a &s;mall &s;hare thereof; &s;o much as &s;erved for bodily &s;upport in great &s;implicity and plain|ne&s;s, he thankfully received; having a te&s;|timony again&s;t all &s;uperfluity, and every thing tending to exalt the mind of man, or

promote worldly greatne&s;s in any degree; &s;eeking above all, the kingdom of Heaven and the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof.</P>
<P>He was a lover of peace among&s;t brethren and in his neighbourhood; and by precept and example, laboured to promote it; being at times concerned to travel about on foot, even in advanced age, to his friends hou&s;es, and pay &s;hort vi&s;its in true chri&s;tian love, and drop weighty and edifying hints, tend|ing to &s;tir up the pure mind; and &s;carcely any thing was &s;aid by him at any time but what had a tendency that way.</P>
<P>He was a remarkable and worthy exam|ple, in con&s;tantly and early attending our religious meetings, until upwards of ninety years of age; when through weakne&s;s and infirmity, he was confined at home, and underwent great bodily affliction with true chri&s;tian fortitude and re&s;ignation to the di|vine will, patiently waiting his change; which was on the 29<HI>th</HI> of the &s;ixth month 1778; aged about ninety-five, and a mini|&s;ter near 70 years.</P>

among us according to ability, in the &s;up|port of the di&s;cipline; of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, careful not to give ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence to any. He was appointed an elder in the year 1772, in which &s;tation he con|ducted to good &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In the early part of the eighth month 1777, he was taken unwell, and being un|der great bodily pain, often begged for pa|tience, &s;aying, he was afraid to a&s;k for any thing el&s;e. After he had been confined a|bout two weeks, his pain &s;omewhat abating, he called his children together, and &s;poke to them as follows:
<Q>It looks as if I may &s;hortly be taken from you, and I think I have nothing to charge my&s;elf with, in regard to bringing you up; I have with great care watched over your morals, and anxiou&s;ly endeavoured by example, to teach you to walk in the fear of the Lord; but a backward di&s;po&s;ition prevailing, which I fear, has &s;ometimes kept me from doing the good I might have done in the world, has at times, when my heart has been earne&s;tly engaged for you, cau&s;ed me to keep &s;ilence, when it might have been profitable to have thus addre&s;&s;ed you: Look to the Lord my children, and a&s;k of him to direct your ways. He mu&s;t be the &s;upport of youth as well as of old age. It is him, and him alone you mu&s;t cleave to, if ever you expect to find peace that will be la&s;ting. It is not moral rectitude, go|ing to meeting, or any outward acts of
<PB N="382" REF="020377_0389_0FAF06DAB1A968D0">
devotion only, that will do for you. Reli|gion is an inward work, and true wor&s;hip mu&s;t be performed in the heart, by quiet|ly waiting on him who is the rock of ages. I know by experience what I &s;ay, there|fore earne&s;tly de&s;ire you to look to the Lord, live near him, and let his fear di|rect you in all you undertake. Keep out of the noi&s;es and confu&s;ions that are in the world, 'tis all delu&s;ion. To be ble&s;t with the pre&s;ence of the Lord in a dunge|on, is preferable to liberty enjoyed in palaces without it. And if it &s;hould plea&s;e the Lord to take me from you, tho' we may part for a &s;ea&s;on, yet if we walk in his ways, we &s;hall hereafter meet in eter|nal bli&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>His di&s;order increa&s;ing, his pain at times was very great, which he was enabled to bear with a good degree of chri&s;tian re&s;ig|nation; often de&s;iring he might be endued with patience to hold out to the end. And altho' his outward tabernacle gradually de|cayed, yet the &s;ea&s;onable and lively expre&s;&s;i|ons which he at times uttered, evidenced that his inward man was frequently re|newed.</P>
<P>A few weeks before his departure, &s;everal friends coming to vi&s;it him, after a &s;ea&s;ona|ble time of &s;ilence, he &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><Q>I have often of late been led to examine my&s;elf, to &s;ee what it is that keeps me back, &s;ometimes I think I &s;ee death ad|vancing &s;wift, and at other times quite
<PB N="383" REF="020377_0390_0FAF06DB7A3590C8">
gone; at this time in particular, I have been led to con&s;ider whether there remains any thing for me to do, and if I have any thing in my heart again&s;t any per&s;on, that my love is not yet perfect; and upon a &s;trict examination, I find nothing but love to mankind univer&s;ally. I have been great|ly tried with pain of body, and poverty and barrenne&s;s of &s;pirit, but through mer|cy have been pre&s;erved from murmuring; and I have a hope, that when I put off this body, I &s;hall be at re&s;t; and that hope is an anchor to the &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P>A day or two before his departure, his pain much abated, and tho' he was reduced very low, yet was pre&s;erved in much calm|ne&s;s and &s;erenity of mind, &s;aying,
<Q>He thought his di&s;&s;olution was near; that he had done with every thing below, and ex|pected the change to him would be a hap|py one, believing a place of re&s;t was pre|pared for him.</Q></P>
<P>He quietly departed this life, the 26<HI>th</HI> of the &s;eventh month 1778, in the &s;ixty-fourth year of his age, and his body was interr'd the day following in friends burying-ground in this city.</P>

<P>HE was born in Ireland the 29<HI>th</HI> of the &s;eventh month 1705, and came to America about the &s;ixteenth year of his age, and &s;ettled in Penn&s;ylvania, where he was convinced of the truth, and married among friends. In the year 1735, he removed and &s;ettled at Pipe-Creek, when there were very few inhabitants in tho&s;e parts. Some years afterwards he was concerned that a meeting might be &s;ettled, which was allowed to be held at his hou&s;e at times for &s;everal years; when the number of friends increa&s;ing, they concluded to build a meeting hou&s;e, which our &s;aid friend zealou&s;ly promoted. His hou&s;e was much re&s;orted to by travelling friends and others, both in that early period and &s;ince, to whom he was courteous and kind.</P>
<P>Some years after the &s;ettlement of a month|ly-meeting at Fairfax, of which he was a member, he was appointed to the &s;tation of an elder, which he filled with propriety and reputation; being an example of plainne&s;s, and anxiou&s;ly careful for the education of his children. He was, at times, concern'd in meeting, to exhort friends to keep to the te&s;timony of truth, and particularly the youth, for whom he &s;eemed zealou&s;ly con|cerned, that as they grew in years they might grow in grace.</P>

<P>SHE was the daughter of Nathan and Mary Stanbury, of this city, who were removed by death in her tender age, after which &s;he was put under the care of our friends Richard and Hannah Hill, by whom &s;he was religiou&s;ly educated: She was en|dued with good natural under&s;tanding, and being obedient to the di&s;coveries of divine grace in her own mind, &s;he experienced a growth and advancement in the life of reli|gion, and through its gradual work, be|came a u&s;eful and active member in the church, being many years in the &s;tation of an elder and over&s;eer.

She felt the affliction of others with tender &s;ympathy, and was enabled through divine help to bear her own, which were various and proving, with great re&s;ignation and chri&s;tian forti|tude.

<P>HE was the &s;on of Zachariah and Sarah Ferris, and was born in Stratford, in Connecticut government, New-England, the 10<HI>th</HI> of the third month 1707. His parents being pre&s;byterians, brought him up in that way, his mother being religiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, and much concerned for her offspring, fre|quently gave them good advice and admo|nition, which had &s;ome good effect with this our friend, as he hath often been heard to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>We find by &s;ome remarks he left, that about the twelfth year of his age, he was frequently vi&s;ited and called unto by the divine monitor in his heart, to for&s;ake evil and youthful vanities which he delighted in, and by being in a good degree faithful there|to, was for a time, pre&s;erved from them; but for want of attending to that which would have continued to pre&s;erve him, the plea&s;ures and vanities of this world got hold of his mind, &s;o that he took much delight in airy and vain company, mu&s;ick and dancing, and &s;uch like amu&s;ements, until about the twentieth year of his age; when
<PB N="391" REF="020377_0398_0FAF06E3D56831B0">
it plea&s;ed the Lord to vi&s;it him with a &s;ore fit of &s;ickne&s;s, which proved of la&s;ting ad|vantage to him, as it occa&s;ioned him to take up a fre&s;h re&s;olution, to for&s;ake the evil of his ways, and turn to the Lord with full purpo&s;e of heart, which he was, thro' mer|cy, favoured with ability in mea&s;ure to perform.</P>
<P>He &s;till continued in profe&s;&s;ion with the pre&s;byterians, not having any knowledge of friends; although by attending to the teach|ings of divine grace, he became convinced of the principle we profe&s;s; and hearing of a yearly-meeting of friends to be held on Long-I&s;land, went to it, with de&s;ires to di&s;|cover whether they were a living people or not, for &s;uch he de&s;ired to find; where he met with what he often longed for, (a peo|ple that wor&s;hipped God in &s;pirit and in truth) which was a great &s;trength and con|firmation to him, in for&s;aking the errors of his youth, and by yielding obedience to the&s;e inward motions, he gained &s;trength, and was more and more enabled to bear a faithful te&s;timony to the truth as it was made known to him.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth month 1733, he removed to Philadelphia, where he joined in religious fellow&s;hip with friends; in 1735 he married Mary the daughter of Samuel and Sarah Ma&s;&s;ey; and in 1737 removed to Wilming|ton in New-Ca&s;tle county, where he re&s;ided the remainder of his days.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="020377_0399_0FAF05AEB2E04EA8">He made &s;ome appearance in the mini&s;try about the year 1734, but through unfaith|fulne&s;s to the divine call, he from time to time put it off, and remained in a neglect of duty therein upwards of twenty years; altho' he was often warned both immediate|ly and in&s;trumentally in a remarkable man|ner, which at length produced a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine will, &s;o that in the year 1755, he was made willing to give up thereto, and therein found great peace.</P>
<P>He travelled thro' divers parts of this continent in the work of the mini&s;try, and by certificates produced on his return home, it appeared, that his conduct, conver&s;ation, and labours abroad were exemplary and edifying, tending to the advancement of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. His doctrine was &s;ound, and acceptable to the hone&s;t hearted, tho' &s;harp again&s;t the hypocrite and rebel|lious, yet tender to the mourners and di&s;|con&s;olate.</P>
<P>He was very &s;erviceable in our meetings for di&s;cipline, which, with other meetings, he diligently attended, not &s;uffering his out|ward affairs to hinder him from what he be|lieved to be his religious duty. And altho' he followed &s;hop-keeping for a living, it was his practice to &s;hut up his &s;hop and take his family with him to week day meetings, often expre&s;&s;ing for the encouragement of others, that he believed it was attended with a ble&s;&s;ing.

<P>Bodily weakne&s;s attended him during the la&s;t three years of his life, and near the clo&s;e of his days, he was much afflicted with &s;ickne&s;s, which he bore with patience, often expre&s;&s;ing his pro&s;pect of his approaching end, and his re&s;ignation therein; &s;aying, 'All is well.'

<P>On the 25<HI>th</HI> of the ninth month 1742, &s;he was married to Je&s;&s;e Hatton; in which &s;tate, &s;he for many years, underwent great outward difficulties, as well as inward exer|ci&s;es and trials on account of the cau&s;e and te&s;timony of truth which &s;he had e&s;pou&s;ed, and was favoured with firmne&s;s to hold her integrity thereto; which &s;he has been heard to commemorate with thankfulne&s;s to the Lord her deliverer, rendering the prai&s;e to him alone, who, even during that trying di&s;pen&s;ation, opened her way to labour con|&s;iderably in his cau&s;e in many places, as in Ireland, Scotland, and again in England.</P>
<P>About the year 1754, &s;he removed with her hu&s;band and family, and &s;ettled in Wa|terford, where &s;he was made truly near to friends and u&s;eful in the Lord's hand.</P>
<P>In the year 1759 her hu&s;band died; and in 1760, being con&s;trained by the love of truth, and having the concurrence of her friends at home and of the meeting of mi|ni&s;ters and elders in London, &s;he entered on a &s;econd vi&s;it to America, which for many years had re&s;ted weightily on her mind.

<P>In the beginning of the eighth month 1764, &s;he embarked at Cork with her hu&s;|band and family in order to &s;ettle here, and arrived in the ninth month following, from which time &s;he belonged to our monthly-meeting, whereof &s;he was a &s;erviceable mem|ber; likewi&s;e was engaged in the love of the go&s;pel, to vi&s;it many of the meetings of friends in this and the adjacent governments, al&s;o the neighbouring yearly-meetings, and in the year 1774, went into New-England, with our friend Elizabeth Robin&s;on from Great-Britain; in which vi&s;its her company and &s;ervices were weighty, &s;trengthening and e&s;tabli&s;hing to friends.</P>

<P>She was an excellent example of &s;teady waiting upon the Lord in &s;ilence, and out of meetings &s;olid and grave in her deport|ment, in&s;tructive and weighty in conver&s;a|tion, watchful over her own family for their good, bearing her te&s;timony again&s;t wrong things in them as well as others; of a di&s;|cerning &s;pirit; and when her lot was ca&s;t in families as well as meetings, was often led to feel for and &s;ympathize with the hidden &s;uffering &s;eed. Having pa&s;&s;ed through the deep waters of affliction her&s;elf, her eye was not unu&s;ed to drop a tear for, and with others in di&s;tre&s;s either in body or mind, and &s;he rejoiced in comforting and doing them good.</P>
<P>She was a living and powerful mini&s;ter of the word, careful not to break &s;ilence in meetings, until favoured with a fre&s;h anoint|ing from the holy one, whereby &s;he was

pre&s;erved clear in her openings, awful and weighty in prayer, her voice being &s;olemn and awakening under the baptizing power of truth.</P>
<P>Many were the heavenly &s;ea&s;ons with which &s;he was favoured during a lingering illne&s;s, in &s;ome of which &s;he was led to ex|pre&s;s her&s;elf in a lively edifying manner, and often, with divine pertinence to the &s;tates of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent; as al&s;o her belief that &s;he &s;hould join the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, in that city who&s;e walls are &s;alvation, and her gates prai&s;e.</P>
<P>One evening, after a &s;olemn &s;ilence, &s;he broke forth in a &s;weet melody, &s;aying,

She then &s;ignified what an exerci&s;e &s;he had laboured under for the good of &s;ouls, and how it wounded her very life, to behold the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity acting incon|&s;i&s;tent with the example of a crucified Sa|viour.</P>
<P>She frequently &s;upplicated the Lord for the continuance of his help, and that &s;he might be endued with patience, adding,

<Q>There is nothing yields &s;uch comfort on a langui&s;hing bed as an evidence of hav|ing performed our religious duties to the be&s;t of our under&s;tanding, I can &s;peak it at this time by experience.</Q>
She &s;poke of the nece&s;&s;ity there was for friends to guard again&s;t keeping in their families per&s;ons of corrupt morals and evil communication, which hath a tendency to poi&s;on the tender minds of their children; and &s;ignified her apprehen&s;ion, that &s;ome parents were &s;tain|ed with the blood of their offspring there|by. At another time, &s;he encouraged &s;ome that were pre&s;ent, to be faithful to the Lord, and to keep to their gifts, adding,
<Q>Oh! what a fine thing it is to &s;it lively in meet|ings, and to witne&s;s the holy oil to run as from ve&s;&s;el to ve&s;&s;el.</Q>
Feeling her&s;elf grow wor&s;e, &s;he gave directions about the laying-out her body, that it &s;hould be with exem|plary plainne&s;s.</P>

<Q>The Lord will &s;earch Jeru&s;alem, he will blow away the chaff; but the wheat, Oh! the weighty wheat he will gather into his holy garner.
It &s;eems to

a mo&s;t rigorous and cruel &s;lavery, whereby many, very many of them, are brought to a melancholy and untimely end.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered, that the inhabi|tants of Britain, who are them&s;elves &s;o emi|nently ble&s;&s;ed in the enjoyment of religious and civil liberty, have long been, and yet are, very deeply concerned in this flagrant violation of the common rights of mankind, and that even its national authority is ex|erted in &s;upport of the African &s;lave-trade, there is much rea&s;on to apprehend, that this has been, and as long as the evil exi&s;ts will continue to be, an occa&s;ion of drawing down the divine di&s;plea&s;ure on the nation and its dependencies. May the&s;e con&s;iderations in|duce thee to interpo&s;e thy kind endeavours on behalf of this greatly oppre&s;&s;ed people, who&s;e abject &s;ituation gives them an additi|onal claim to the pity and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the generous mind; ina&s;much as they are alto|gether deprived of the means of &s;oliciting effectual relief for them&s;elves.

<P>THE memory of the ju&s;t is pronounced "Ble&s;&s;ed;" which we wi&s;h to be verifi|ed in the following memorial of this our
<PB N="421" REF="020377_0428_0FAF05CB99C19508">
e&s;teemed friend, by affording an excitement to &s;urvivors to walk in her &s;teps.</P>
<P>The days of her youth and early periods of maturer age, were attended with clo&s;e trials, &s;tripping &s;ea&s;ons, and deep bapti&s;ms, through all which the Lord her gracious helper (who&s;e tender regard is ever manife&s;t|ed towards his humble depending children) pre&s;erved her, and rai&s;ed her up to be a ve&s;&s;el in his hou&s;e. About the forty-&s;econd year of her age, being in 1759, &s;he &s;ettled with her hu&s;band William Trimble within the limits of this meeting, to which &s;he was recommended by certificate from Go&s;hen monthly-meeting, as an approved mini&s;ter, which character &s;he ju&s;tly retained during her &s;tay in mutability.</P>
<P>Her public appearances, tho' generally in few words, were truly acceptable and edify|ing, being clear, pertinent, comprehen&s;ive and &s;avoury, and accompanied with deep humility and gravity of deportment. She was not forward in the exerci&s;e of her gift, but appeared de&s;irous to proceed therein under divine direction. At two different times &s;he vi&s;ited friends in Maryland and Virginia, and once in North and South-Carolina, in which vi&s;its her go&s;pel labours were well received.</P>
<P>Her common deportment was in&s;tructive; evidencing lowline&s;s, meekne&s;s and &s;elf-de|nial; that it may ju&s;t be &s;aid, her
<Q>Adorn|ing was that of a meek and quiet &s;pirit.</Q>
Her conver&s;ation, tho' plea&s;ant and cheer|ful, was accompanied with that &s;weetne&s;s
<PB N="422" REF="020377_0429_0FAF05CC33EB4668">
and gravity which rendered it both agreea|ble and profitable. Her heart and hou&s;e were open to the reception and entertain|ment of her friends; nor was her benevo|lence and humane feelings circum&s;cribed to tho&s;e in religious communion with her; but the poor, we believe, of all denominations in the neighbourhood where &s;he lived, par|took of her kindne&s;s, and by her removal have lo&s;t a &s;ympathizing friend.</P>
<P>During the time of her la&s;t illne&s;s, &s;he was much given to &s;tillne&s;s and retiredne&s;s of mind, being &s;ometimes unea&s;y with friends conver&s;ing on temporal &s;ubjects in her pre&s;ence. Her hope and faith in her dear redeemer, we believe did not fail her in this her la&s;t and trying period; though &s;he was very lowly and humble in her own e&s;timation, and at times almo&s;t diffident of her being worthy of divine regard: Thus in her ca&s;e may be applicably revived, the an|cient interrogation,
<Q>If the righteous &s;carce|ly be &s;aved, where &s;hall the ungodly and &s;inner appear?</Q>
May this awaken profita|ble reflections in the minds of all, e&s;pecially the carele&s;s and indifferent.</P>
<P>On the 14<HI>th</HI> of the &s;ixth month 1784, &s;he quietly departed this life, in the &s;ixty-&s;eventh year of her age; and on the 16<HI>th</HI> was buri|ed at Concord, attended by many friends and others, at which time was held a large and &s;olemn meeting. And we doubt not but &s;he is gone from works to an happy reward.</P>

<HEAD>A Te&s;timony from the Monthly-Meeting of Friends of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> for the <HI>Southern-Di&s;trict,</HI> concerning <HI>JOHN REYNELL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH none of us were acquainted with him whil&s;t he re&s;ided in Great-Britain, the land of his nativity, yet we have cau&s;e to believe, from what him&s;elf has ex|pre&s;&s;ed, that he was early vi&s;ited with the offers of divine love, and by wi&s;ely clo&s;ing in therewith, he came to experience pre&s;er|vation from many temptations and allure|ments wherewith the minds of unwary youth are liable to be en&s;nared.</P>
<P>To &s;everal of his particular friends, he, at times, mentioned &s;ome tran&s;actions pre|vious to his coming to this country, which containing matter of encouragement to faithfulne&s;s in others, we apprehend may not improperly be here in&s;erted, viz.</P>
<P>When about eighteen years of age, pur|po&s;ing to embark on a voyage to Jamaica, and being thoughtful le&s;t he might lay down the body at that place, as had been the ca&s;e with many, he received, as he believed, a divine a&s;&s;urance that his life &s;hould be pre|&s;erved. During his re&s;idence there, he had a &s;ight given him, of a grievous calamity by means of a violent hurricane, to befall the inhabitants of the I&s;land as a cha&s;ti&s;e|ment for their iniquities, which came to pa&s;s according to his pro&s;pect. Soon after|wards an occurrence happening which oc|ca&s;ioned
<PB N="424" REF="020377_0431_0FAF05D0F5D1A620">
his being called upon to give evi|dence in a court of judicature, he was re|quired to take an oath, which he con&s;cienti|ou&s;ly refu&s;ing, it proved for a time, no &s;mall trial of his faithfulne&s;s; and although he had few or none outwardly to look to for &s;trength and encouragement under that ex|erci&s;e, he was neverthele&s;s favoured to ex|perience divine &s;upport to be near, &s;o that neither threatning nor per&s;ua&s;ion could pre|vail on him to deviate from our chri&s;tian te&s;timony in that re&s;pect. Very few of the members of our religious &s;ociety then re&s;ided on that I&s;land, yet a meeting-hou&s;e belong|ing to friends &s;till remaining in King&s;ton, he was not ea&s;y to omit attending at the times appointed for meeting, though he &s;ometimes &s;at alone therein.</P>
<P>About the twentieth year of his age he came to Penn&s;ylvania, and after &s;ettling in this city, he became a &s;erviceable member among us both in a religious and civil capaci|ty, cheerfully employing his talents and much of his time to beneficial and laudable purpo&s;es, and was often engaged as a peace|maker in reconciling differences.</P>
<P>As an elder, he approved him&s;elf in faith|fulne&s;s and uprightne&s;s in the di&s;charge of that important tru&s;t, being well qualified for the &s;tation he filled. A good example in diligently attending our religious meetings as long as ability of body permitted, and very u&s;eful in the exerci&s;e of the di&s;cipline. A man of integrity and &s;ound judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="020377_0432_0FAF05D1EF23CB78">Being favoured with an affluence of tem|poral riches, he endeavoured to fulfil his duty as a good &s;teward, by liberally com|municating of his &s;ub&s;tance to &s;uch as &s;tood in need. Be&s;ides his repeated acts of liberali|ty throughout the cour&s;e of his life, the many charitable legacies he bequeathed by his will, are further proofs of his benevo|lent di&s;po&s;ition. So that we believe it may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, he was one that
<Q>Feared God and hated covetou&s;ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1784, his natu|ral &s;trength evidently impairing, he beheld the pro&s;pect of his approaching di&s;&s;olution with the &s;erenity and compo&s;ure of a chri&s;|tian; and continued gradually declining for &s;everal months, during which time he did not impart much re&s;pecting his own &s;piritual &s;tate, being de&s;irous to be more in &s;ub&s;tance than &s;hew, yet found it needful to keep up a &s;teady watch until his warfare &s;hould be accompli&s;hed.

<Q>That on look|ing over his pa&s;t life, he was &s;en&s;ible of many deficiencies,</Q>

About the year 1733 they were joined in marriage, proving true help-meets to each other; and as they advanced in age, grew in grace, and a qualification for &s;er|vice in the church in the prime of life, be|ing of a meek and inoffen&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition, well beloved and truly u&s;eful members in the meeting to which they belonged; in dealing with offenders, endeavouring to con|vince and re&s;tore, yet careful that the te&s;ti|mony of truth might be pre&s;erved blamele&s;s.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their beginning in the world was &s;mall, a ble&s;&s;ing attending their indu&s;try and frugality, they got a comfort|able &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for them&s;elves, and to bring up their family; cheerfully and kindly en|tertaining many friends in tho&s;e early days, and having a near &s;ympathy with the me&s;|&s;engers and &s;ervants of the Lord, who were tried and proved with humbling baptizing &s;ea&s;ons, were often enabled to &s;peak a word of comfort and encouragement to &s;uch; af|fectionate and helpful to tho&s;e in affliction, charitable and con&s;iderate to the poor, many partaking of their bounty, they were nearly united with friends.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="020377_0434_0FAF05D2C080F3B8">Their care over their family, and concern to bring up their children in plainne&s;s, &s;im|plicity, indu&s;try, and the attendance of re|ligious meetings, was great. Katharine thro' weakne&s;s and infirmity, particularly in old age, often endured much pain in riding to meetings, yet when there, her &s;olid innocent countenance and deportment therein were edifying. When near her end, during &s;everal weeks painful &s;ickne&s;s, &s;he retained her in|nocent &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, expre&s;&s;ing re&s;ignation to her allotment; often advi&s;ing her children and tho&s;e about her to live in love. Some of her la&s;t expre&s;&s;ions that could be under&s;tood, were,
<Q>There is re&s;t and peace prepared for me, where I &s;hall &s;ing hallelujahs to the highe&s;t!</Q>
And after a lit|tle pau&s;e, &s;aid,
<Q>Thy &s;weetne&s;s, O Lord! is great.</Q>
She quietly departed the 2<HI>d</HI> of the fourth month 1781, in the &s;ixty-eighth year of her age, and on the 5<HI>th</HI> was interr'd in friends burying-ground at New-Garden.</P>
<P>William was &s;upported under the trial of this &s;eparation, with becoming re&s;ignation to the divine will; having through life been an example of punctuality, ju&s;tice, temper|ance and brotherly kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>On account of bodily infirmity, which at times made riding hard to bear, he often went on foot, when above &s;eventy-five years of age, upwards of four miles to meeting; his faithfulne&s;s and example wherein, the becoming manner of his &s;itting there, evi|dencing a watchful &s;olid frame of mind,
<PB N="428" REF="020377_0435_0FAF05D3895E50C0">
was very in&s;tructive. On the 22<HI>d</HI> of the tenth month 1785 (having been for &s;ome|time much confined at home) he was taken ill, and tho' afflicted with much pain of bo|dy, his under&s;tanding was pre&s;erved &s;ound, and faculties clear. In the morning of the 23<HI>d</HI> to two of his children he &s;aid,
<Q>There is always &s;omething comes to take us out of the world, and if we are but prepared it is the le&s;s matter;</Q>
one of them expre&s;&s;ing a hope that he did not feel any thing to the contrary; he replied
<Q>No, no, I don't, I have a comfortable hope and belief that all will be well.</Q>
Remarking &s;ome little time af|ter, on the &s;ettlement of his affairs, his &s;mall beginning, and how he had been favoured through life; he expre&s;&s;ed his concern and &s;ympathy for divers friends in &s;traitened circum&s;tances, and that he had been much exerci&s;ed at times on account of many in &s;ociety who appeared forward and zealous, but thro' neglect or mi&s;management of their outward affairs, had mini&s;tered cau&s;e of re|proach; ob&s;erving that it was wi&s;dom not to appear in &s;hew more than in &s;ub&s;tance, either in our religious or temporal concerns. The night of the 25<HI>th</HI> he communicated to &s;ome of his children much &s;ea&s;onable and heart-tendering advice; recommending a|bove all things to &s;trive for an everla&s;ting inheritance, whereinto they might enter when done with time; concluding in the&s;e words,
<Q>Love truth, love one another, love friends and all good people, even all man|kind,
<PB N="429" REF="020377_0436_0FAF05D438365D98">
and be careful to hurt none, no not the very meane&s;t, if ye can do them no good, ye &s;hould do them no harm.</Q>
Then mentioning the uncertainty of his continu|ance here, gave directions that his coffin &s;hould be plain, no poli&s;h or &s;tain upon it.</P>
<P>Being very low on the 28<HI>th</HI> and apprehen|&s;ive of his end being near, he &s;poke to &s;ome of his children, de&s;iring, when the change came, all might keep &s;till and quiet; ad|ding, it was an awful time, and ought to be &s;o to tho&s;e about him. Some hours af|ter, &s;aying, it would be a relief if he might be favoured in his pa&s;&s;age, his bodily di|&s;tre&s;s being great;
<Q>But I mu&s;t not com|plain, it don't become us to complain, but we may tell each other of our afflictions without complaining or murmuring; for the Almighty has been good to me in my affliction, &s;o that we have great cau&s;e to love him.</Q>
A few hours after &s;aid,
<Q>What manner of per&s;ons ought we to be, to bear every di&s;pen&s;ation of affliction and trial that comes upon us, as we ought to do?</Q>
Saying at another time,
<Q>Many tedious days and weari&s;ome nights had been his lot the&s;e eighteen months pa&s;t.</Q>
His &s;on ex|pre&s;&s;ing his belief that re&s;t would be very acceptable, he replied,
<Q>Yes, an everla&s;ting re&s;t.</Q>
On the 13<HI>th</HI> of the eleventh month he uttered the following &s;upplication,
<Q>O Lord God Almighty! if it be thy ble&s;&s;ed will, mitigate my affliction, and relieve me in my di&s;tre&s;s; not my will but thine
<PB N="430" REF="020377_0437_0FAF05D50F593300">
be done.</Q>
And a little after &s;aid,
<Q>The appointed time will come, and it mu&s;t be waited for, he knows be&s;t the right time; his wi&s;dom is very great, and care and providence over his poor creatures very great indeed.</Q>
To one of his children, taking leave of him, he &s;aid, in &s;ub&s;tance,
<Q>There is great corruption in the world among&s;t mankind, and need there is of care in bringing up children, and young people, to re&s;train them; for many are running as the wild a&s;&s;es upon the moun|tains.</Q>
A few days before he departed he &s;aid,
<Q>It is a comfort to me to have my children with me, and it may be a &s;atis|faction to them to &s;ee me go; I feel ea&s;y in mind on looking backward and for|ward, I &s;ee nothing in my way, the Lord has been good to us, and e&s;pecially to me in my affliction.</Q>
Much more he expre&s;&s;|ed at &s;undry times, continuing &s;en&s;ible, but gradually weakening, he departed this life, on the 24<HI>th</HI> of the eleventh month 1785, in the eighty-fir&s;t year of his age, having been an elder upwards of 40 years, and having ruled well was worthy of double honour, his memory being of good &s;avour. On the 27<HI>th</HI> he was interr'd in friends burying-ground at New-Garden; attended by a large number of people, with whom a &s;olid meet|ing was held.</P>

<HEAD>Some expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>JOSEPH HUSBAND,</HI> before and in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, read and approved in the Monthly-Meeting of Friends at <HI>Deer-Creek</HI> in <HI>Maryland,</HI> and directed to be for|warded to the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Quarterly-Meeting.</HEAD>
<P>A CONSIDERABLE time before his de|cea&s;e, when in health, he &s;ometimes mentioned to his friends, and frequently to his wife, his pro&s;pect that his time would not be long here, and in or near his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, told her that he felt ea&s;y, and be|lieved he &s;hould &s;oon be taken from her. Some days before his death he appeared ex|ceeding low in mind attended with many doubts re&s;pecting his pa&s;t and then &s;itu|ation, remaining &s;everal days in great di|&s;tre&s;s; after which it plea&s;ed the Lord to manife&s;t him&s;elf to him in &s;o extraordinary a manner, that his wife perceiving a change, a&s;ked him how he was; he an&s;wered I am better than I expected ever to be, my mind is now relieved, and, as a morning without clouds, all appears &s;u&s;hine, mentioning to her and a friend pre&s;ent, many trials and temptations he had experienced; at another time &s;aying, deep has been the bapti&s;m I have pa&s;&s;ed through, my &s;oul hath been dipt into a feeling &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of un|believers, yea, I have pa&s;&s;ed through the valley of the &s;hadow of death, which I am now convinced we mu&s;t do before we can experience a glorious re&s;urrection unto eter|nal

life. And frequently &s;aid, my dear I feel thy &s;ympathy and love, and ah! how precious do I feel the unity of the church; often mentioning divers of his near friends, and continuing in a &s;weet frame of mind, not complaining of pain (tho' the nature of his di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned much) his countenance remaining &s;erene and plea&s;ant to the la&s;t; a few minutes before his death he &s;poke to this purpo&s;e,
<Q>Give my dear love to friends, and tell them I die in the faith which I lived in, and firmly believe I &s;hall &s;oon enter into the man&s;ions of eter|nal happine&s;s prepared for the true believ|ers in Chri&s;t; and altho' I never did much for the cau&s;e and te&s;timony of truth, I &s;hall be with the believers, and that is enough;</Q>
&s;oon after which he quietly de|parted this life, on the 6<HI>th</HI> day of the fifth month 1786, about the fiftieth year of his age; being the next day interr'd in friends burying-ground at Deer-Creek.</P>

<P>THE foregoing account concerning our friend Jo&s;eph Hu&s;band, being communicat|ed to us, was read here and approved; and from the knowledge and &s;en&s;e many of us had of him for a number of years, this meeting is free to add, that it appears he was born in Cecil county, Maryland, came into religious member&s;hip with friends after
<PB N="433" REF="020377_0440_0FAF05DAA9036F78">
he arrived to man's e&s;tate, having been con|vinced of the principle of truth while young, more by inward conviction than in&s;trumental means, as he was educated in the way of the epi&s;copal church (&s;o called) and even when a lad, had to pa&s;s through many trials under his father, for declining that way of wor|&s;hip; and (as he related to his wife and others) he frequently felt great tenderne&s;s towards the negro children with whom he was brought up, from the pro&s;pect of their &s;tate of &s;lavery, which much affected him at times before he was ten years of age. He conducted with reputation and &s;tability as a u&s;eful friend, manife&s;ting a lively un|&s;haken concern for the maintenance of our di&s;cipline, the furtherance of our te&s;timony again&s;t an hireling-mini&s;try, and &s;lave-hold|ing, as well as for the doctrine of peace, e&s;pecially thro' the difficulties which occur|red in the late times of public requi&s;itions for the purpo&s;es of war; &s;hewing chri&s;tian fortitude, humility and re&s;ignation under &s;ufferings and clo&s;e trials of different kinds which fell to his lot. Sometime before his decea&s;e he appeared in public te&s;timony, in which he was not forward, but mo&s;tly brief, pertinent and acceptable to friends; being remarkably open to receive coun&s;el as well as to give; we find the remembrance of his di&s;po&s;ition and &s;ervice is &s;atisfactory, both among the members of the monthly-meet|ing he belonged to, and this meeting.</P>

<P>SHE was born the 13<HI>th</HI> day of the fifth month 1743; her parents Nathan and Rachel Yarnall, members of Middletown particular meeting, having been careful to educate her in plainne&s;s and a diligent at|tendance of religious meetings, &s;he retain|ing a thankful remembrance of their care over her, has been often heard to ble&s;s the Lord on their account, as by their good coun&s;el and whole&s;ome re&s;traint, they con|tributed to her pre&s;ervation out of the vain fa&s;hions and cu&s;toms of the world.</P>
<P>By her own account, her mind was early in life accompanied with earne&s;t de&s;ires af|ter the knowledge of truth, and that &s;he might never do any thing to offend him whom &s;he often found near to her comfort, or that might bring a reproach on the pro|fe&s;&s;ion &s;he made; but giving way to her na|tural vivacity, &s;he frequently indulged her|&s;elf in what with &s;ome is accounted i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cent pa&s;time, for which &s;he was often b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ght under condemnation; and about the twen|ty-fourth year of her age was plunged into great di&s;tre&s;s, being clo&s;ely be&s;et with the wiles of an unwearied adver&s;ary; but the Lord, who will not &s;uffer his people to be

tempted beyond what they thro' his grace are enabled to bear, made way for her e&s;cape from under the power of temptation, for which &s;he had, in that day, as on the banks of deliverance, to &s;ing to the prai&s;e of his holy name; &s;aying,
<Q>It is in my heart to prai&s;e thee O my deliverer! for thy ma|nifold kindne&s;&s;es unto me a poor un|worthy worm; for altho', for di&s;obedi|ence, thou ha&s;t &s;een meet t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hide thy face for a moment; yet my &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s hum|bly bowed before thee, rendering unto thee the prai&s;e of all thy works; having witne&s;&s;ed the fulfilling of thy promi&s;e.</Q>
<Q>But with everla&s;ting kindne&s;s will I have mercy on thee &s;aith the Lord thy re|deemer.</Q></P>
<P>In the twenty-&s;ixth year of her age &s;he was married to Jo&s;hua Sharples, &s;ettled within the compa&s;s of New-Garden month|ly-meeting, of which &s;he became a u&s;eful member, being qualified for &s;ervice in the church, whereto &s;he attended with much &s;atisfaction to friends, filling the &s;tations of over&s;eer and elder with diffidence under a &s;en&s;e of the weight thereof.</P>
<P>In the thirty-fir&s;t year of her age &s;he ap|peared in the mini&s;try, and being faithful, grew in her gift, was &s;ound in doctrine, accompanied with a degree of heart-tendering authority to the carele&s;s and indolent, yet edifying and con&s;olatory to the refre&s;hment of the mourners in Zion.
<PB N="436" REF="020377_0443_0FAF05DD313EF2E8">
In her approaches to the throne of grace in public &s;upplication, &s;he was awfully attend|ed with deep &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>She was a great lover of the &s;criptures, and well qualified to apply them to edifica|tion and in&s;truction, being concerned to invite friends and others to a more frequent reading of them. The doctrines of the principle of truth as held by friends &s;he was &s;kilful in explaining, and was often exerci&s;ed therein in mixed auditories, endeavouring to lead out of forms to the &s;ub&s;tance of true religion. Much of her time was thus em|ployed in the public &s;ervice of her Lord and ma&s;ter, cheerfully giving up to his holy re|quirings, but carefully concerned to wait for his putting forth.</P>
<P>Having peculiar &s;ervice in vi&s;iting fami|lies, &s;he was often u&s;efully engaged there|in; and about the year 1778 with divers other friends under appointment from the We&s;tern quarterly-meeting, in a general vi|&s;it to all the meetings belonging thereto, &s;he was exerci&s;ed under a deep concern to labour that a reformation in life and manners might be really effected among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of truth. Soon after, being removed within the compa&s;s of our meeting, &s;he engaged in a like vi&s;it to the meetings in our quarter, wherein, as in other of her go&s;pel labours, &s;he manife&s;ted an ardent de&s;ire for the pro|motion of the cau&s;e of truth, and that &s;he might be favoured to do her days work in the day-time. And &s;ince, with the concur|rence
<PB N="437" REF="020377_0444_0FAF05DE00D3DA60">
of friends, vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meet|ings in the Southern governments; be|ing diligent in the improvement of her time for the &s;ervice of truth, often drawn into family vi&s;its, and to the afflicted either in body or mind, who experienced the con|&s;oling &s;ympathy of her tender &s;pirit, in which and other go&s;pel labours &s;he reaped the reward of peace and comfort to her own mind. When at home &s;he was not only di|ligent in attending meetings her&s;elf, but careful to encourage and a&s;&s;i&s;t her family in their duty therein; in her&s;elf an example of plainne&s;s, and mindful to promote a like &s;implicity in tho&s;e under her direction, ma|nife&s;ting much concern that her children might be brought up in the truth, frequent|ly retiring with them for their improvement, her faithfulne&s;s again&s;t wrong things in them being con&s;i&s;tent with the tenderne&s;s of an affectionate mother. Great was her ex|erci&s;e for the ri&s;ing generation, that their hearts might be early dedicated to the Lord, and they thereby pre&s;erved in a conduct con&s;i&s;tent with our holy profe&s;&s;ion. Open and ho&s;pitable in her hou&s;e, a true help-meet and affectionate wife.</P>
<P>Shortly after her return from a vi&s;it to friends on the Ea&s;tern-Shore of Maryland, in the &s;ixth month 1786, &s;he was brought very low thro' bodily indi&s;po&s;ition, but fa|voured with inward con&s;olation and true peace, expre&s;&s;ing that &s;he felt her mind much weaned from the things of this world,
<PB N="438" REF="020377_0445_0FAF05DEF4B0AD90">
and if it &s;hould plea&s;e the Lord to call her hence &s;he found nothing in her way. On a fir&s;t-day afternoon, divers friends being pre&s;ent, after a time of &s;ilence, &s;he &s;poke to this effect,
<Q>I am glad of this opportunity; as I lay on the bed this morning, my mind was carried away to meeting with friends, and I thought if I had wings I could have flown thither for the great love I feel for the members of that meeting. Indeed we have had many favoured opportunities to|gether; and you &s;ee I am in a poor weak way, and whether I &s;hall get out again I have not &s;een, but am re&s;igned, and feel the reward of peace; but if &s;ome friends of that meeting are not more faithful to the many gracious vi&s;itations which have been in mercy to them extended, weak|ne&s;s will overtake them, and they be in danger of mi&s;&s;ing the an&s;wer of well done.</Q>
She recovered and afterwards had many heart-tendering opportunities with friends there, and others not in member&s;hip with us, toward whom &s;he was remarkably led in te&s;timony, in order that they might be gathered to the fold of re&s;t.</P>
<P>About two weeks before her decea&s;e &s;he attended &s;everal of the neighbouring meet|ings, expre&s;&s;ing her &s;atisfaction therewith; and on the fir&s;t-day before her departure, was at New-Garden meeting and had ac|ceptable &s;ervice, having al&s;o a favoured op|portunity the &s;ame evening in a friends fa|mily where &s;he lodged on her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> home,
<PB N="439" REF="020377_0446_0FAF05DFE40B0530">
at which time &s;he was concerned to revive the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of the P&s;almi&s;t,
<Q>Lord make me to know mine end, and the mea|&s;ure of my days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am: Behold thou ha&s;t made my days as an hands breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee.</Q>
Which &s;he enlarged on to edification. Next day &s;he got home &s;omewhat indi&s;po&s;ed, but held up till the day following in the evening of the 16<HI>th</HI> of the fir&s;t month 1787, when &s;he was confined to her bed, and lay in a &s;en&s;ible re&s;igned frame of mind, being, as we believe, well prepared for her awful change, appearing to have nothing to do but to die. Some of the la&s;t words &s;he was heard to &s;ay were, 'I believe I am going,' and in about fifteen minutes after, quietly breathed her la&s;t on the 18<HI>th,</HI> and on the 20<HI>th</HI> was interr'd at Birmingham, aged forty-three years and &s;even months, a mini|&s;ter upwards of 12 years.</P>
