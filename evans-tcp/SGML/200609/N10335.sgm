<HEAD>TO THE CITIZENS of <HI>New-York,</HI> On the pre&s;ent critical Situation of Affairs.</HEAD>
<P>WERE I neither a Philadelphian, a New-Yorker, a Bo&s;tonian, nor even a native of this continent, as a friend to the rights of mankind, I &s;hould intere&s;t my&s;elf in the fate of America. America mu&s;t at pre&s;ent be con&s;idered as the principal, or indeed the only remaining &s;eat of liberty &mdash;In Cor&s;ica, Sweden, Poland &s;he has been borne down by the direct hand of violence; and in our parent country, &s;he is &s;app'd by corruption to &s;o dangerous a degree, that &s;he totters from the foundation, and unle&s;s propp'd by the virtue and &s;pirit of her colonies, &s;he mu&s;t inevitably fall to the ground. A regular plan has been formed by the pre&s;ent court, for the introduction of arbitrary power;&mdash;this is no declamation, and did the &s;ize of this paper admit of it, I could prove the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion by numberle&s;s in&s;tances: The privileges, and indeed natural rights of the &s;ubject, have been invaded in every part of the empire, one while by open force, another by cabal and the arts of corruption &mdash;Even the i&s;lands of Mi|norca, Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, have not been protected by their in&s;ignifi|cance, from the &s;courge of tyranny.&mdash;Great Britain and Ireland have been drained almo&s;t to the la&s;t farthing, not for any national purpo&s;es, but to increa&s;e the influence of the crown, in creating new placemen, pen&s;ioners, and of cour&s;e enemies to the public welfare, and liberty.</P>
<P>General warrants, violation of the rights of election, the disfran|chi&s;ement of the proprietors of the Ea&s;t India &s;tock, murders committed, murderers pardoned, encouraged, rewarded, and the other overtacts (of trea&s;on, I may &s;ay) which the mini&s;try have been guilty of again&s;t law, magna charta, and the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, are &s;o notorious, that it is almo&s;t impertinent to mention them; but there are other indications, or rather evidences of the temper and views of the court, which ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence and which mu&s;t convince the &s;ubjects that they are to expect nothing but from their own virtue and firmne&s;s,&mdash;</P>
<P>Every writer in &s;upport of boundle&s;s prerogative, every jacobite hi&s;to|rian, (the Humes, Guthries and Smollet's) has been care&s;&s;ed, placed or pen&s;ioned. Attacks have been made under the au&s;pices of the court, not only on the revolution, and the principal promoters of the revo|lution, but a &s;cheme has been laid, and to the utmo&s;t of their power carried into execution, to pro&s;cribe virtue her&s;elf, by &s;ubverting the reputation of her brighte&s;t models&mdash;They argue thus, <HI>if we can &s;pread the per&s;ua&s;ion, that public virtue never did exi&s;t in a human brea&s;t that patrioti&s;m has been in all ages only a ma&s;k for de&s;igning men; we &s;hall gain the following point, we &s;hall render mankind totally indifferent who are in office, who are not; whether a Pitt or a Bute&mdash;what maxims we rule by, what maxims we repudiate, whether we profe&s;s tho&s;e of an Alfred, or a Stuart, will be a matter of indifference to the public, if we can once convince them, that their intere&s;ts ever have been, and ever will be equally out of the que&s;tion.&mdash;When we have thus de&s;troyed all political confidence, we have rea&s;on to flatter our&s;elves that the people will not be &s;uch fools as to think of oppo&s;ition, or re&s;i&s;tance, but without giving them&s;elves any unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, &s;ubmit to the yoke we are preparing for them.</HI> To accompli&s;h the&s;e pious purpo&s;es, &s;ome fit in&s;trument was to be &s;ought and found, &s;ome man of a &s;ufficiently corrupt heart, to qualify him for the ta&s;k. This in&s;trument was found in a certain Sir John Dalrymple, (who in the admini&s;tration of Lord Rockingham had been turned out of an important office, which he held in Scotland, for manife&s;t cor|rupt practices &mdash;He was detached into France, and recommended by Lord Mansfield, and another very great per&s;onage, to the famous Duke D'Aiguillon; he, who had trampled on the few remaining laws of France, and exterminated their virtuous Parliaments.&mdash;the Duke D'Aiguillon, with the candour (as this Dalrymple tells us) in&s;eparable from every mini&s;ter of a great King catches the idea of our court, (and as might be expected from &s;o natural an ally) patronizes the pro|ject, and con&s;igns to their agent, the key of the <HI>depote des affaires etran|geres.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Office of records of foreign affairs.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;Here he &s;ets him&s;elf to work, to rummage, to garble, to de|falcate, to forge,&mdash;for without &s;training inferences, it is almo&s;t certain that he did forge&mdash;at length he triumphantly &s;allies forth, with the te&s;ti|monies, as he hopes to per&s;uade us, of the non-exi&s;tence of human virtue, with proofs that her brighe&s;t patterns were knaves and hypo|crites. It would be ea&s;y (tho' here might be thought tedious) to over|turn the whole foundation, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> defeat the intended effects of this abominable production;&mdash;but I cannot help remarking, that were the proofs of Sydney and Ru&s;&s;el's being traytors irrefregable, he who &s;hould produce them, would be held in abhorrence by every friend to humanity.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome models of human virtue &s;hould be held up to our imitation: He who would remove from our &s;ight the&s;e few mo|dels which hi&s;tory has left to us, would check every noble ardour of the &s;oul, as it would then appear madne&s;s to attempt attaining what is in|compatible with our nature It may now perhaps be a&s;ked what can be the intention (in an addre&s;s to the citizens of New-York) of &s;o long a preamble on the conduct and &s;pirit of the court, in matters which do not particularly relate to America. I will explain to you my intenti|on; it is to convince you, that when a &s;pirit &s;o ho&s;tile to general li|berty prevails, in tho&s;e who have the power at home, you have only to hope for redre&s;s of grievances from the united virtue and firmne&s;s of the colonies; that the idea of proceeding by petition and remon&s;trance, is the mo&s;t ridiculous idea that ever entered into weak heads. Can you &s;eriou&s;ly think your petitions would have any effect at this in&s;tant, when the confidence and temerity of the mini&s;try are mounted to &s;o much higher a pitch than we have hitherto &s;een them? Can you &s;eriou&s;ly think that your petitions would operate more &s;trongly on &s;o firmly a fixed mini&s;ter, backed by a va&s;t majority in parliament, than the petitions of the city of London, and the principal counties of England, with the fir&s;t men of property and character, and a con&s;iderable number of the members at their head did on a mini&s;ter le&s;s firmly &s;eated; a mini|&s;ter, not only le&s;s firmly &s;eated, but perhaps a much le&s;s bold and determined foe to liberty, than the pre&s;ent.&mdash;It is no calumny, it is no exaggeration to &s;ay, that Lord North is a determined foe to liberty.&mdash; He is &s;o by inheritance; de&s;cended from one of the mo&s;t forward and active in&s;truments of tyranny under Charles the &s;econd; every &s;peech, every action of his life demon&s;trates him to be the genuine offspring &mdash; On the brave Cor&s;icans he never be&s;towed a gentler Epithet than rebels and traitors.&mdash;The mention of American liberties, the &s;uppo&s;ition that they had any liberties, always threw him into a frenzy of rage,&mdash; foaming at the mouth, and with eyes &s;tarting from their &s;ockets, He has denounced, or rather vomitted forth eternal war again&s;t you and your po&s;terity.&mdash;He has had the arrogance, the madne&s;s to declare, in the open &s;enate, that he never would receive, never hear any petitions from America, until he had her at his feet.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered that this avowed foe, and per&s;ecutor of Ame|rica; this furious fanatick in de&s;poti&s;m, is now become the omnipotent mini&s;ter, I mu&s;t repeat, that the idea of redre&s;&s;ing grievances by peti|tion and remon&s;trance, is the mo&s;t contemptible idea, that ever entered into weak heads. It is indeed &s;o very contemptible, that we cannot &s;up|po&s;e tho&s;e who adopt it are in earne&s;t;&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;u&s;pect them of &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns&mdash;They mu&s;t mean, under the cloak of coolne&s;s and moderation, to check the vigour, &s;o ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite at this junc|ture, and to prevent the only po&s;&s;ible means of redre&s;s; they mu&s;t mean to recommend them&s;elves to the future favour of your oppre&s;&s;ors. &mdash;They perhaps already devour in their minds, contracts, &s;alaries, and pen&s;ions, for which, (if the mini&s;try &s;ucceed) funds will be immediately e&s;tabli&s;hed out of the fruits of your hone&s;t labour and indu&s;try.&mdash;They mu&s;t be con&s;cious that all the force and troops they can employ, will not effect their purpo&s;es, unle&s;s the corruption of your own members powerfully co-operates &mdash;Upon the whole, con&s;idering the critical &s;itu|ation of affairs, the impending ruin over our heads, I cannot help being a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;omewhat &s;hocked, at the conduct of this city&mdash;Is this a time to amu&s;e your&s;elves with narrow local politicks and di&s;putes? Is this a time, when the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of your&s;elves, of po&s;terity, and of mankind are at &s;take, (for the cau&s;e of liberty is the cau&s;e of mankind)? Is this a time I &s;ay, to indulge your little prejudices, jealou&s;ies, and per&s;onal piques? For &s;hame citizens, di&s;|card all &s;uch di&s;graceful &s;entiments; a&s;&s;ume a more noble character; &s;ave your&s;elves from the infamy which threatens you; let not the com|mon ruin be laid to your charge. For my own part, I neither pretend to approve nor to condemn the mea&s;ure which the committee hath lately thought proper to cen&s;ure &mdash;But this I will pretend to &s;ay that the publi&s;hing the cen&s;ure, may have mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences; it may, by propagating the opinion of divi&s;ions &s;tarting up in this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ding capi|tal, repre&s;s the ardour of your own counties, of the other colonies, di&s;courage your friends at home, and give fre&s;h vigour to your enemies; and (the ha&s;te with which the publi&s;hing this cen&s;ure was pre&s;&s;ed, with the profe&s;&s;ed intention of tran&s;mitting it by the packet) gives. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, a very &s;u&s;picious air to its authors &mdash;the de&s;ign could not be good. It has already furni&s;hed matter of triumph to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of liberty. One man in particular (he is indeed an official man, not a native of this country, and remarkable for his alacrity in political wickedne&s;s) &s;ings <HI>te deum,</HI> I am told, in all companies on this occa&s;ion, con&s;idering the victory as in&s;ured to his idol de&s;poti&s;m &mdash;There are now &s;ome far|ther con&s;equences to be apprehended from the pre&s;ent conduct of this city, which perhaps have not occurred to you, and which therefore I &s;hall beg leave to offer to your con&s;ideration &mdash;Is it not to be apprehended that the Bo&s;tonians, when they turn their eyes and addre&s;s their prayers to you, as a leading people of America, for &s;uccour in their di&s;tre&s;s; and when in&s;tead of the vigour and noble &s;pirit they had rea&s;on to expect from your former exertions, they &s;ee nothing but backwardne&s;s, frivo|lous delays, and (as to them it will appear) total dearth of &s;pirit; is it not to be apprehended, that having no pro&s;pect of relief, they may grow de&s;perate? And that their de&s;pair, in conjunction with the corruption of individuals among them&s;elves, (for you may be a&s;&s;ured that General
<PB REF="013118_0002_0F8FF96BC3378C20">
Gage has unlimited credit on the trea&s;ury for the purpo&s;es of corruption) may drive them into the wi&s;h'd for fatal conce&s;&s;ion; the <HI>general &s;eal of American bondage&mdash;The admi&s;&s;ion of the right of taxing you without your own con&s;ent?</HI> Is it not to be expected, that the in&s;tant they have dive&s;ted them&s;elves of the character of freemen and taken up that of &s;laves, they will become the favourite colony of the court? That it will then be di&s;|covered, that they have been mi&s;repre&s;ented? That they had indeed for &s;ome time been deluded by a few factious demagogues, but that in fact, they were a loyal, dutiful and affectionate people?&mdash;This will be the language affected by the General, and this will the mini&s;try o&s;tentatiou&s;ly affect to believe.&mdash;When they have thus commuted the character of freemen for that of &s;laves, will they not act the part natural to &s;laves? Be the ready in&s;truments for reducing others to the &s;ame &s;ituation with them&s;elves? And when a people &s;o potent in numbers and other re|&s;pects as New England, is thrown into the &s;cale of the military I am at a lo&s;s to know what means on this continent can be devi&s;ed for re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>For my own part, O citizens of New-York, &s;uppo&s;ing my&s;elf a Bo&s;to|nian, and that my country were reduced to the wretched &s;ituation I have de&s;cribed, through your dilatorine&s;s, di&s;affection, or want of virtue, I am afraid there is no mea&s;ure (be it ever &s;o tyrannical) my Lords and ma&s;ters could dictate again&s;t you, which I &s;hould not from re&s;entment, find a plea&s;ure in putting into execution.&mdash;For in&s;tance &s;hould they think proper to revive in this particular province, the odious &s;tamp act, (and &s;uch is the wantonne&s;s and in&s;olence of tyranny, that they would probably choo&s;e it, in preference to any other mode of oppre&s;&s;ion, as a trophy of their victory) I &s;hould, I am afraid, with alacrity lend my hand to enforce it.&mdash;I am &s;en&s;ible that in hazarding the&s;e &s;entiments, I may give to many, a di&s;advantageous picture of my own di&s;po&s;ition; it may be, that I mi&s;take my&s;elf, but as re&s;entment operates &s;o &s;trongly on the human brea&s;t, even the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed, and as &s;lavery &s;o vitiates the human heart, the apprehen&s;ion is far from groundle&s;s.&mdash;This, at lea&s;t, is certain, that &s;hould the people of Bo&s;ton be en&s;laved, and have rea&s;on to impute their calamity in part, or principally to New York, there is no degree of animo&s;ity and hatred they could afterwards bear to New-York, which would not in a great mea&s;ure be ju&s;tified; and it is equally certain, that the liberties of the betrayers would not long &s;urvive tho&s;e which they had betrayed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now, O citizens, intreat that you will attribute what I have of|fered, to the genuine motive; to an ardent zeal for the liberties of Ame|rica, and the rights of mankind; that you will believe me at the &s;ame time mo&s;t &s;incerely attached to the real intere&s;ts of Great Britain; no man can have a higher reverence for the people of England than my&s;elf; I e&s;teem them, in all re&s;pects the fir&s;t people of the univer&s;e. But when our parent is thrown into a dilirium, by the quackery of a murdering im|po&s;tor, is it not the duty of her children to prevent her committing out|rages, not only immediately de&s;tructive to them&s;elves, but which mu&s;t end in her own ruin? When her phrenzy is pa&s;t, &s;he will thank us for the pious re&s;traint. There is one con&s;ideration which renders the pre&s;ent delu&s;ion of the people of England with re&s;pect to America, really won|derful; it is that the very &s;ame men &s;hould have been able to bring about this delu&s;ion, whom they them&s;elves have ever held in contempt and ab|horrence. The &s;ame men who within doors have violated, baffled, or eluded their mo&s;t &s;acred laws, di&s;&s;ipated and refu&s;ed to account for their trea&s;ures, treated with in&s;ult their petitions and remon&s;trances; and who have externally &s;acrificed their intere&s;ts, annihilated their importance, and tarni&s;hed their glories?&mdash;That the&s;e men &s;hould have wrought upon them, is &s;o prepo&s;terous and unnatural that the delu&s;ion cannot be of a long continuation; they mu&s;t &s;oon open their eyes; they will then thank Providence, that the &s;en&s;e and virtue of their colonies has &s;aved them from the de&s;truction into which their own infatuation would have plunged them &mdash;Such are the &s;entiments which I entertain, &s;uch are the principles I po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;and if you believe them &s;incere, they will be &s;uffici|ent apologies for my addre&s;&s;ing you in this extraordinary manner; and that they are &s;incere, I call to witne&s;s that Eternal Being, who is the judge of the truth of all hearts. I &s;hall now conclude with ob&s;erving, that there are two roads pre&s;ented to you; the one leading to &s;ecurity, freedom, happine&s;s, and honour; the other which terminates in wretch|edne&s;s, &s;lavery, and infamy to you and your children's children&mdash;it is of the greate&s;t concern, therefore, to be a&s;&s;ured of the fidelity of your conductors. If they turn their eyes to the right or left, from the direct object of their charge, <HI>the general welfare,</HI> to little views of imagined &s;elf intere&s;ts, you and your po&s;terity are lo&s;t. The more we reflect, the more we are &s;truck with the importance of what you are now about to re&s;olve, of the nece&s;&s;ity there is of paying the mo&s;t &s;erious attention to the characters of tho&s;e whom you &s;hall appoint your Delegates.&mdash;If among&s;t tho&s;e propo&s;ed for your election there &s;hould be a man whom you think aver&s;e to &s;chemes of non-importation and even non exportati|on to the i&s;lands, if nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;that is in fact a man who&s;e mind has been &s;o narrowed by commercial habits, that he would po&s;tpone the permanent &s;ecurity and freedom of the whole, to his own temporary per&s;onal advan|tages: Let him be rejected, as totally unworthy of &s;o momentous, &s;o dignified a tru&s;t &mdash;Is there a man who ever did, or you &s;uppo&s;e ever will hold any office under a mini&s;try odious as the pre&s;ent? Him reject, as de&s;titute of all principle. But above all, is there a man who has upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, been heard to propo&s;e or recommend petition and re|mon&s;trance as the propere&s;t mode of obtaining redre&s;s? Him reject with &s;corn and indignation&mdash;for if he is in earne&s;t, his capacity mu&s;t be mi&s;erably low indeed, and if he is not in earne&s;t, he certainly means to betray you.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;trenuous civil re&s;i&s;tance is nece&s;&s;ary to your &s;alvation unle&s;s you prefer a civil <HI>war</HI> a few months hence, to civil <HI>re&s;i&s;tance</HI> now, or are determined to &s;ubmit to ab&s;olute <HI>&s;lavery.</HI> Let your choice of Delegates be proportioned to the importance of the occa&s;ion.&mdash;I do not think tran|&s;cendent talents ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; a common good under&s;tanding: &s;ufficient, but unque&s;tionable heartine&s;s, zeal, and fervor in the com|mon cau&s;e, are inde&s;pen&s;ible&mdash;in &s;hort, let your choice corre&s;pond with what we are taught to expect from the other colonies, and not only the &s;ecurity, happine&s;s, and liberties of America will be fixed on a foundation which a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">es &s;hall not &s;hake, but you may re-animate your parent country, by &s;ubverting a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of government which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> an end to her exi&s;tence.</P>
