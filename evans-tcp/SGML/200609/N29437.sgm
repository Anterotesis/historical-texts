<HEAD>A FUNERAL ELEGIE (Written many years since) On the Death of the Memorable and truly Honourable John Winthrope <ABBR>Esq:</ABBR> Governour of the Massachusets Colony in N-England. For the space of 19 years, who died in the 63d. Year of his Age. March 26. 1649</HEAD>
<L>YOu English <HI>Mattachusians</HI> all</L>
<L>Forbear sometime from sleeping,</L>
<L>Let every one both great and small</L>
<L>Prepare themselves for weeping.</L>
<L>For he is gone that was our freind,</L>
<L>This Tyrant Death hath wrought his end.</L>
<L>Who was the very Chief among</L>
<L>The chiefest of our Peers</L>
<L>Who hath in peace maintain'd us long</L>
<L>The space of nineteen years,</L>
<L>And now hee's breathless, lifeless, dead,</L>
<L>Cold earth is now become his bed.</L>
<L>The Jews did for their <HI>Moses</HI> weep</L>
<L>Who was their Gubernator,</L>
<L>Let us for <HI>Winthrope</HI> do the like,</L>
<L>Who was our Conservator</L>
<L>With Lines of gold in Marble stone</L>
<L>With pens of steel engrave his name</L>
<L>O let the Muses every one</L>
<L>In prose and Verse extol his Fame,</L>
<L>Exceeding far those ancient Sages</L>
<L>That ruled <HI>Greeks</HI> in former Ages.</L>
<L>O spightfull Death and also cruel</L>
<L>Thou hast quite slain <HI>New-Englands</HI> Jewel:</L>
<L>Shew us vile <HI>Tyrant</HI> if thou can</L>
<L>Tel where to find out such a man?</L>
<L>Methinks I hear a spirit breathe</L>
<L><HI>Non est inventus</HI> here beneath.</L>
<L>He was (we surely may say this)</L>
<L><HI>Rara avis in terris,</HI></L>
<L>Therefore let us give him his due,</L>
<L>To him is due this stile,</L>
<L>He was an <HI>Israelite</HI> full true</L>
<L>Without all fraud or guile.</L>
<L>Let <HI>Winthrops</HI> name still famous be,</L>
<L>With us and our Posterity.</L>
<L>What goods he had he did not spare,</L>
<L>The Church and Commonwealth</L>
<L>Had of his Goods the greatest share,</L>
<L>Kept nothing for himself.</L>
<L>My tongue, my pen, my rustick art</L>
<L>Cannot express his true desert.</L>
<L>The nature of the Pelican</L>
<L>Read storyes what they say,</L>
<L>To her I would compare this man</L>
<L>If lawfully I may.</L>
<L>To <HI>Moses</HI> meek, to <HI>Abraham,</HI></L>
<L>To <HI>Joseph</HI> and to <HI>Jonathan.</HI></L>
<L>He was <HI>New-Englands</HI> Pelican</L>
<L><HI>New-Englands</HI> Gubernator</L>
<L>He was <HI>New-Englands Solomon</HI></L>
<L><HI>New-Englands</HI> Conservator.</L>
<L>Time and Experience the best tryal,</L>
<L>These two admit of no denial:</L>
<L>Let nineteen yeares then witness be</L>
<L>Of <HI>Wintrops</HI> true sincerity.</L>
<L>Such gifts of grace from God had he,</L>
<L>That more than man he seem'd to be.</L>
<L>But now hee's gone and clad in clay,</L>
<L>Grim Death hath taken him away.</L>
<L>Death like a murth'ring Jesuite</L>
<L>Hath rob'd us of our hearts delight.</L>
<L>Let's shew our love to him by weeping</L>
<L>That car'd for us when we say sleeping.</L>
<L>O that our dry eyes fountains were,</L>
<L>Our heads a living spring,</L>
<L>O that our sighs the clouds could tear,</L>
<L>And make an eccho ring:</L>
<L>Let us sit down in sorrow fel,</L>
<L>And now with tears ring out his knel.</L>
<L>Bright shining <HI>Phoebus</HI> hide thy face</L>
<L>Let misty clouds make dark thy sky,</L>
<L>Fair <HI>Cynthia</HI> count it no disgrace</L>
<L>To aid us with thy weeping eye.</L>
<L>O weep with us for <HI>Joshua</HI></L>
<L>The Loadstone of <HI>America.</HI></L>
<L>My sences they are all too weak</L>
<L>His praises due to write or speak</L>
<L>Now I must leave it to their skill</L>
<L>Who can endite and write at will.</L>
<L><HI>New-England</HI> thou hast cause to mourn,</L>
<L>For that thy special friend is gone.</L>
<L>Yet see you mourn with moderation,</L>
<L>No cause you have of Desparation,</L>
<L>They yet survive who may renew</L>
<L>Decay'd and dying hopes in you</L>
<L>With honour due let us respect them,</L>
<L>No cause we have for to reject them,</L>
<L>They are to us as true Directors</L>
<L>And under God our chief Protectors.</L>
<L>Here you have <HI>Lowells</HI> loyalty,</L>
<L>Pend with his slender skill</L>
<L>And with it no good poetry,</L>
<L>Yet certainly good will.</L>
<L>Read these few verses willingly,</L>
<L>And view them not with <HI>Momus</HI> eye,</L>
<L>Friendly correct what is amiss,</L>
<L>Accept his love that did write this.</L>
<BYLINE>Perciful Lowle.</BYLINE>
