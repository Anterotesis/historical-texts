<P>YOUR <HI>Creator endued you with shining talents, and cast your lot in a field of action, where they might be most happily employed: In the progress of a long and industrious life, you devoted them to a single purpose, the elevation of your cha|racter above his. For the accomplishment of this purpose, with a diligence and uniformity which would have adorned the most virtuous pursuits, you opposed truth, religion, and their authors, with sophistry, contempt, and  obloquy; and taught, as far as your example or sentiments extended their influence, that the chief end of man was, to slander his God, and abuse him forever. To whom could such an effort as the following be dedicated, with more propriety, than to you. The subject it cele|brates is the most pointed attack upon your old enemies; an attack more happily devised, at least, than any of yours; as yours were more advantage|ously concerted than the efforts of any of your pre|decessors. Reasoning is an unhappy engine to be employed against christianity; as, like elephants in ancient war, it usually, in this case, turns upon those who employ it. Ridicule is a more convenient weapon, as you have successfully evinced; but in|genious

<L>ERE yet the Briton left our happy shore,</L>
<L>Or war's alarming clarion ceas'd to roar,</L>
<L>What time the morn illum'd her purple flame,</L>
<L>Thro' air's dread wilds the prince of darkness came.</L>
<L>A cloud his gloomy car; his path around,</L>
<L>Attendant whirlwinds gave a fearful sound,</L>
<L>Before him dragons wound their bloody spires;</L>
<L>Far shot behind him death's Tartarean fires:</L>
<L>To image heaven's high state, he proudly rode,</L>
<L>Nor seem'd he less than hell's terrific God.</L>
<L>While, full before him, dress'd in beauteous day,</L>
<L>The realms of freedom, peace, and virtue lay;</L>

<P>Such advantages does Infidelity enjoy over Revelation, that both sides of moral questions will equally support that, and weaken this. Thus one Infidel will overthrow Revelation by proving that there is not one honest man living; an|other will as successfully attack it by asserting, and the assertions of Infidels are always to be taken for proofs, that there are honest men of all religions and opinions. One sees intuitively that God never did, nor can, reveal his pleasure to mankind. Another finds the Koran and Shahstan in the list of Revelations. Plato's devotion of him|self to a courtizan, and Socrate's to Alcibiades were the effusions of honest, virtuous hearts; but Paul's dedication of his life to the Redeemer was a reverse of enthusiasm. God also, tho' dishonoured by adoration, presented to him in the character of a holy sin-hating God, and incapable of being pleased, when invoked in the name of Jesus Christ, is yet glorified, when honest votaries address him, in the elevated character of an ox, an onion, or a snake, and is highly delighted with invocations, when offered in the pleasing and prevailing name of the devil.</P>
