<HEAD>PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>THIS piece is a continuation of my "Virgin of the Sun." My worthy friend, Mr. Schroeder, has made several slight al|terations in it, upon which I, relying on his secrecy&punc; might safely hold my peace; but which I shall now gratefully acknow|ledge; partly, because I am not ashamed to take instruction from such a man as Schroeder; partly, because otherwise some ill-tempered critic may, as heretofore, upon the applause which the piece receives, rush forward, like an envious blood-hound, to lessen my share of merit with the public. The alterations are such as Mr. Schroeder made himself, or such as I have made by his advice.</P>
<P>To the first of these belongs, in preference, the expunging a scene of Diego's, which, without having any connection with the interest of the whole, interrupted, by untimely jests, the progress of the first act. Further, the suppression of a finale, and an air which Elvira, very unseasonably, sung to the guitar. Further, the circumstance, that Pizarro only guessed at Elvira's design upon his life, which, before this alteration, Rolla, with|out hesitation, discovered to him; and thereby, perhaps, cast an appearance of ungenerous conduct upon his character. Fur|ther, the mitigating Pizarro's baseness, where he, in violation of his promise, seeks to get Rolla again in his power.</P>
<P>I have myself, at his desire, metamorphosed Valverde the priest, into a private secretary; because, wicked priests can be tolerated only on the great theatre of the world, and not upon the stage of a play-house. But I designed this alteration only for the stage; and, that the press should restore this wretch again to his historical character. At present I have neither time nor inclination to attend farther to him.</P>
<P>Unquestionably, the alteration which has been most service|able to the piece is, the ennobling of Elvira's character, which I undertook by his advice, and for which I sincerely thank him.</P>
<P>Other alterations, which Mr. Schroeder thought proper to recommend, in compliance with the spirit of the times, I have not made. I see, for example, no reason why we should re|frain
<PB N="iv" REF="037757_0003_100ED4C8B99C2F28">
from saying, that the Pope, by his bull, made a present of America to the Spaniards; that, by another bull, he declar|ed the Indians to be men and not apes; that thirteen Indians were crucified by the Spaniards to the honor of Christ and the twelve apostles. Why must that be suppressed on the stage, which history has so loudly proclaimed?</P>
<P>I take this opportunity of saying a few words concerning two other of my pieces. A certain Mr. Schutze has confidently asserted, in his History of the Hamburg Theatre, that Mr. Schroeder had made great alterations in "Count Benyowsky," to which that piece owed its success. This, with his permis|sion, is not true. Mr. Schroeder altered nothing in "Count Benyowsky;" and Mr. Schutze will do well, in future, to seek better information.</P>
<P>The "Literary Gazette" has had the goodness to judge of my Sultan Wampum <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A very pleasant farce, which I hope to present to the public. <BIBL>TRANSLATOR.</BIBL></NOTE>, (a hasty composition, upon which I do not set a very great value) with more kindness than I, perhaps, should have done myself; although it has formerly, in opposi|tion to the public applause, condemned and trampled in the dust some performances of mine whose merit is far superior.</P>
<P>For this kindness I am grateful, and will here make known, that some of the censured, and truly censurable, verses do not belong to me, having been altered, probably to suit the fancy of the composer, without my knowledge; and remaining so, because I was too far from the place of publication to superin|tend the press.</P>

<P>Who has permitted thee to break in upon my slumbers? Is it not enough that the tumults of the camp destroy my nightly rest?&mdash;But leave me, and I forgive thee&mdash;I would rather have my sense of hearing tortured, than my sight. Leave me, or I inform Pizarro of your insolence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inform Pizarro!&mdash;Nay, lady, rather in|form me through what magic this Pizarro has en|chained thee? Wild and unseemly in his looks, a hypocrite in friendship, in love a tyrant&mdash;</P>

<P>A swineherd in his youth, he now in man|hood treats mankind as swine. Illiterate as an Andalusian muleteer, he cannot even read or write!</P>

<P>Love only reads in the eyes, and knows but to write on the heart. I saw in Pizarro a hero, a leader of men&mdash;in thee I see not man.</P>

<P>Indulge your sportive mockery, while the sun of our prosperity yet shines. When the thun|der rolls, tremble&mdash;The tempest is not far distant.</P>

<P>Valverde a prophet!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are we not in a strange country, where death lies in wait in every plant, in every fruit we pluck to satisfy our hunger? Those whom the sword of the enemy spares, an unwonted climate destroys. Daily the number of our foes encreases, while every sun lights a Spaniard to his grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>El.</SPEAKER>
<P>And does that grieve Valverde? Are not the survivors the heirs of the dead?</P>

<P>Away, away! Think you I cannot discern the wolf, although the garment of the lamb adorns him? I know ye all. There's not a man in all the camp that speaks his thoughts except the good Las Casas.</P>

<P>O, had I known this venerable man in early life, how different might have been my lot!</P>

<P>Pizarro then, perhaps, had found more ob|stacles to fair Elvira's love&mdash;</P>

<P>How now! presumptuous priest!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, lady, but it moves my won|der still, that such a man could ever gain your love. You say you saw a hero. What has Pi|zarro done to gain the title?</P>

<SPEAKER>El.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ask Spain, ask Europe, ask both hemis|pheres that question. When with a pigmy vessel and one hundred men he quitted Panama, to con|quer an unknown world, my heart whispered, "This is a brave man." But when upon the lit|tle island <HI>Gallo,</HI> he drew a line with his sword in the sand, and permitted all to abandon him who chose to pass that line; when only thirteen trusty men swore to follow, and he at their head dedicat|ed himself to death, my heart cried aloud, "A hero!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were fame herself enamoured of Pizarro, she could not sound his praises in loftier key than does Elvira. But believe me, lady, Pizarro's brilliant actions belong only to the past. As long as Alonzo de Molina instructs and leads the ene|my, Pizarro's heart will not be gladdened by the shouts of victory.

<P>That the enemy, through superior num|bers and the instructions of Alonzo de Molina&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alonzo! Only women, and men more weak than women, could think of danger from a source so mean. The ungrateful traitor! How I once loved that man! His noble mother en|trusted him a boy to my protection. He feasted at my table&mdash;he slept in my tent. I saw the spark of heroism in his soul, and hoped to fan it to a flame.&mdash;Oft when I recounted our first adventures&mdash;what toils we struggled with&mdash;what perils we surmounted&mdash;how, landed on an un|known coast, famine, fatigue, discord within and thronging foes without, thinned our scanty ranks, while still I stood undaunted and main|tained my purpose and my power, in spite of growling mutiny and bold revolt, till with my faithful few I stood victorious!&mdash;Then would the youth Alonzo, with tears of wonder and delight, fall on my neck, and swear his soul's ambition knew no other leader.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>And whose rude foot destroyed the hope|ful seed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Smooth-tongued Las Casas. He it was, with fascinating craft and canting precepts of hu|manity, raised in Alonzo's mind a visionary en|thusiasm, which forced him, as the stripling term|ed it, to forego his country's claims for those of human nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so become <HI>thy</HI> enemy and <HI>Spain's.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>But first, with weariless remonstrance, he strove to win me from my purpose, and wrest the

sword from my determined grasp, calling the Pe|ruvians our brethren.</P>

<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heathens our brethren! In <HI>that</HI> I see Las Casas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when he found that his tears fell on marble, he flew and joined the foe: then, profit|ing by the lessons he had gained in wronged Pi|zarro's school, the youth so disciplined and led his new allies, that soon he forced me&mdash;Ha! I burn with shame and fury while I own it!&mdash;in base discomfiture to quit the shore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the hour of revenge is come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is!&mdash;With <HI>mightier</HI> power, a <HI>second</HI> time I tread Peruvia's strand. Soon shall Alonzo know Pizarro lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is yet a question, whether Alonzo lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even now, one of his armour-bearers is made prisoner. He says the foe is full twelve thousand strong, led by Alonzo and a chief called Rolla. This day they sacrifice unto their God. We must profit by their security; attack them un|prepared, and make their altars reek with human blood.

<P>'Tis well! 'tis just I should be humbled&mdash; I had forgot myself, and in the cause of innocence assumed the tone of virtue. 'Twas fit I should be rebuked&mdash;and by Pizarro. Fall, fall, ye few reluctant drops of weakness&mdash;the last these eyes shall ever shed. How a woman can love, Pi|zarro, thou hast known too well&mdash;how she can hate, thou hast yet to learn. Yes, thou un|daunted! Thou, whom yet no mortal hazard has appalled! Thou, who on Panama's brow didst make alliance with the raging elements, that tore the silence of that horrid night&mdash;when thou didst follow, as thy pioneer, the crashing thunder's drift, and stalking o'er the trembling earth, didst plant thy banner by the red volcano's mouth! Thou, who, when battling on the sea, and thy brave ship was blown to splinters, wast seen&mdash;as thou didst bestride a fragment of the smoking wreck&mdash;to wave thy glittering sword above thy head&mdash;as thou wouldst defy the world in that ex|tremity!&mdash;Come fearless man&mdash;now meet the last and fellest peril of thy life&mdash;meet! and survive&mdash; an injured woman's fury, if thou canst.

<P>For the last time, through the cleft dun|geon's roof, I now behold the quivering lustre of the stars. Despise death. So spoke the enlight|ened among the Greeks and Romans&mdash;heathens confident in wisdom. And shall a christian trem|ble?&mdash;The vigorous youth struggles against a pre|mature death&mdash;a death in the morning of life. No, Alonzo, date not thy life, which thou hast run, by the mean reckoning of the hours and days which thou hast breathed: a life spent worthily, should be measured by a nobler line&mdash;by deeds of usefulness and hours of bliss.&mdash;Deeds which have made a nation happy, and hours enriched by Co|ra's love&mdash;Cora!&mdash;Ah, there I draw upon the cord that binds me to the world!&mdash;My wife! my child! &mdash;Here the tears of love hold me, and there the smiles of innocence. Yes, Cassius, thou wast not a husband! Seneca, thou wast not a father! Loud cries the voice of nature, "Live"&mdash;and my heart re-echoes the tone.&mdash;Yes!&mdash;Lord of my destiny!

<P>Your love? Who gave the bastard this honest name? Between ourselves, Valverde, when I hear you speak of love, you appear to me like a pick-pocket; who, while he bears the blessing of God in his mouth, is devising the best means of pur|loining your purse.</P>

<P>Valor captivates maiden hearts more than erudition. Pizarro fights with the sword, and you with the pen. He sheds blood, and you only ink.</P>

<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>And both to very little purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>El.</SPEAKER>
<P>But with all your scribbling Nugnez Balboa had never discovered the South sea; with all the axioms of your Aristotle, Pizarro and Almagro would never have fitted out a ship. You might have remained buried in your scholastic dust; and I, per|haps, been still a nun.</P>

<P>Indeed! Then you little know Pizarro's subtle thirst for honor. If fortune lead him to her highest step, he will be|stow his hand on one whose high birth may hide his own mean origin; whose connexions at court may be his protection.
