<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>GOD alone is immortal&mdash;Jehovah alone liveth forever.&mdash;Were immortality the lot of man; were it not appointed unto man once to die; could the practice of the &s;ublim|e&s;t virtues; could the prayers of the pious, or the ble&s;&s;ings of a grateful nation have averted the &s;troke of Death; we &s;hould not, my fathers, friends, and fellow citizens, have met to mourn the death of our beloved WASHINGTON. We &s;hould not, at this time, have attuned our voices to mournful melody, or rai&s;ed our pray|ers for comfort to the Great Source of con&s;olation in this day of our &s;orrow. For our nation would yet have rejoiced in his life;
<PB N="4" REF="038684_0004_1015B996CD0CB2C0">
and our children's children would have &s;een the man who gave them that liberty, which, I tru&s;t in a merciful God, our children's children will ever enjoy.</P>
<P>BUT never ending length of days are not the laurels, with which the Supreme Being crowns virtue; and WASHINGTON, the great and the good, is mingled with the clod of the valley. That voice, which in&s;pired us with courage in the hour of danger, &s;hall no more be heard in the land; and that invincible arm, &s;o often rai&s;ed for our protection, is laid low in the du&s;t. But, though his voice is forever &s;ilent, yet he &s;hall forever &s;peak to us by his great example. Gather then ye children of our political father, around his tomb, and hear the in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on of your parent's life.</P>
<P>TRUE, my friends, no children of his loins lifted their little arms and rai&s;ed their &s;uffu&s;ed eyes around his dying bed, to catch a father's la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing; but WASHINGTON was not childle&s;s; he was the father of his country, the parent of millions; and who is there &s;o mean among you, that is not of the happy number?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="038684_0005_1015B99A54E7BEE0">
ON this day, &s;acred to family &s;orrow, let every jarring pa&s;&s;ion be hu&s;hed; and let the tomb of WASHINGTON be the grave of political animo&s;ity. Often, fellow citizens, may we turn the hi&s;|toric page, often may we read le&s;&s;ons of virtue in the volumes of the morali&s;t; but alas! a thou&s;and volumes are too few to teach us what is virtuous and honourable. But the life of WASHING|TON is a compendium of in&s;truction. His life is a practical treati&s;e of the cardinal virtues. Would you learn how, to live? Read his life. Would you learn how to die? Vi&s;it his dying bed.</P>
<P>HE taught us how to live, and oh! too high a price for human knowledge, taught us how to die. Point me out a virtue which adorns man, and I will &s;hew it to you brilliantly illuminated in his life.</P>
<P>WOULD our youth learn that vigour of mind which incites to deeds of pith and moment, &s;ee the youthful WASHINGTON, in the dawn of life, pur&s;uing alone his hardy career through the trackle&s;s de&s;ert, to avert the tomahawk of the &s;avage from the vi|tals of his countrymen; or &s;ee him protect the baffled troops of the expiring Braddock on the banks of the Monongahela.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038684_0006_1015B99C80EBD700">
WOULD our fellow citizens be &s;oldiers? Are they ambitious to command the armies of their country? View WASHINGTON on the heights near Bo&s;ton, teaching the hands of the untutored yeoman to war, and his fingers to fight.</P>
<P>WOULD you po&s;&s;e&s;s that martial courage which com|mands &s;ucce&s;s? Pa&s;s the Schuylkill with WASHINGTON, on that tremendous night, when, warring with the embattled ele|ments and &s;uperior forces, he led in triumph the troops of Heffer.</P>
<P>WOULD you imitate that fortitude which &s;u&s;tains the hero in the dreadful hour of adver&s;ity? Follow WASHINGTON through the Jer&s;ies, at the head of his di&s;comfited troops, when the la&s;t &s;park of American hope was coru&s;cated from his freeled brea&s;t.</P>
<P>WOULD you learn that Chri&s;tian, that divine grace of forgive|ne&s;s to your enemies? See him &s;ave the youthful ASGIL from ignominy and a di&s;graceful death.</P>
<P>WOULD you po&s;&s;e&s;s that dignified virtue of equanimity, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dictatorial power, and humility in the re&s;ignation of it? Pur&s;ue WASHINGTON to the tented field, and read his Re|&s;ignation of his high Commi&s;&s;ion of Commander in Chief of the armies of the United States.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="038684_0007_1015B99EC30DB148">
WOULD you impre&s;s mode&s;ty, that &s;eal of all the Virtues, up|on all your actions? Peru&s;e his official Letters.</P>
<P>WOULD you entwine the laurels of glory round deeds like the&s;e? Then, like him, &s;erve your country without pecuniary re|ward</P>
<P>DOES civil life delight you? Are you ambitious of &s;erving your country with reputation in the civil grades of Society? Re|member that gloomy, di&s;tracting period, which &s;ucceeded the clo&s;e of our War with Great Britain, when Americans knew not how to enjoy, in peace, that Liberty and Independence which their valour had won in war; when our nervele&s;s general govern|ment could only recommend mea&s;ures, and the States receiv|ed their recommendations with indifference or contempt; when our American Government was trampled upon at home, and in|&s;ulted from abroad; when the jarring States lo&s;t &s;ight of the na|tional good in their own individual intere&s;t; when all was tu|mult and confu&s;ion; then remember how WASHINGTON, like the fabled god of the Ocean, rai&s;ed his maje&s;tic head amid&s;t the political &s;torm, and &s;tilled the madne&s;s of the people. Remem|ber how he a&s;&s;ociated with the Fathers of our land; traced the
<PB N="8" REF="038684_0008_1015B9A04FCFF170">
principles of our Government with his pen; and &s;igned that great Charter of our Freedom, the Federal Con&s;titution; and, as the Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of the United States, reduced to practice the tran&s;cendent theory of Government, which his wi&s;dom had con|ceived: and when he retired to private life, to prepare to mount to a world more congenial with his &s;pirit, remember how like the prophet Elijah he dropt his mantle upon us in his la&s;t legacy to the people. Would you learn the true intere&s;t of America? Study attentively this precious relic; and as you &s;tudy, ble&s;s, gratefully ble&s;s, the &s;ainted lips which pronounc|ed it.</P>
<P>WOULD you learn to devote your whole lives to the &s;ervice of your country? See Wa&s;hington, when new dangers threatened our country, again i&s;&s;ue from the peaceful &s;cenes of dome&s;tic life, from the bo&s;om of his family, and in&s;pired by a love for you, a|gain arm his aged limbs for battle, and clo&s;e his well &s;pent life in your &s;ervice.</P>
<P>BUT there are many in this a&s;&s;embly, who may de&s;pair of imi|tating the&s;e illu&s;trious deeds; but to the meane&s;t of you, in the humble&s;t walks of private life, I repeat, copy WASHINGTON;
<PB N="9" REF="038684_0009_1015B93BB2069460">
for he was not only the glory the wonder of public, but the brighte&s;t ornament of private life.</P>
<P>IF it be not your ambition, my humble friends, to be elevated in the armies or the councils of your country, yet would you fill the minor offices of &s;ociety? I point you to the great WASH|INGTON, once the leader of our armies; once and again the Fir&s;t Magistrate of our Union; with all his blu&s;hing honours thick up|on him, &s;elling the place of a common juryman at a State Court in Virginia, and humbly thanking his fellows for rai&s;ing him to the importance of their foreman.</P>
<P>WOULD you excel as farmers? See WASHINGTON, the hu&s;bandman, following his own plough, and tracing the furrow in his native fields.</P>
<P>WOULD you become e&s;timable in married life? Would you be loved and re&s;pected as affectionate hu&s;bands? Where &s;hall I &s;hew you a brighter example of conjugal excellence? Would you know what a hu&s;band WASHINGTON was; go to the mournful halls of Mount Vernon; &s;eek there the &s;orrowing widowed mat|ron, who, with our nation this day, deplores her mighty lo&s;s.&mdash;Oh! &s;he will tell you that though the &s;ame of her hero, his wi&s;|dom
<PB N="10" REF="038684_0010_1015B9A4C40BC440">
in council, his might in battle, have delighted her ears; yet it was the milder virtues of the hu&s;band which touched her heart.</P>
<P>MINGLE your tears with hers, my fair country women. They are the tears of virtue: and they adorn the faire&s;t cheek. Man may admire her fortitude, but it is the female heart alone which can participate in her griefs. When &s;he lo&s;t a hu&s;band, you lo&s;t a friend. It was his arm which protected you, and the helple&s;s innocence of your babes in the rage of battle; he re&s;pected your &s;ex in the per&s;on of this amiable woman; and will you not &s;ym|pathize with her in her affliction and &s;orrow? Some of you per|haps have been &s;eparated from excellent men by the &s;troke of death. Oh! at tho&s;e &s;olitary moments, when bu&s;y, meddling memory, in barbarous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, mu&s;ters up the fond endear|ments of your tender heart; at tho&s;e cheerle&s;s moments when you recollect pre&s;&s;ing the clay cold hand of a dying hu&s;band, wiping the clammy &s;weat from his forehead, while his fixed eye balls gave the la&s;t look of affection upon you, and clo&s;ed forever; when you remember that heart rending hour, when you thought all happi|ne&s;s flown from you forever, and you felt your&s;elf alone, and the world was a blank before you; then, while your agonized bo|&s;oms
<PB N="11" REF="038684_0011_1015B9A90836F378">
throb with angui&s;h at your own lo&s;s; think on the pangs of her who mourns a WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>BUT, to return to the delightful theme of his virtues, would you, my friends, practi&s;e charity?</P>
<L>"He had an eye &s;uffus'd with pity's &s;ofte&s;t drops,</L>
<L>And a hand open as day to melting charity."</L>
<P>He was the kinde&s;t neighbour, the humane&s;t ma&s;ter, and the firm|e&s;t friend the world ever &s;aw. In a word, he loved his country and reverenced his God. His belief in the Chri&s;tian verity was not o&s;tentatiou&s;ly di&s;played from his lips; but he conformed to the outward duties of Religion; he reverenced the holy mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, and I tru&s;t his deeds are recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life.</P>
<P>SUCH was the man whom we lament; and &s;uch was the man whom the world applauds. The would is filled with the fame of our departed hero; and the &s;ighs we this day rai&s;e, and the lamen|tation we utter, will be reechoed acro&s;s the broad Atlantic. The citizens of France will weep over the cor&s;e of their great precep|tor in the &s;chool of Liberty; and Briti&s;h genero&s;ity, in &s;pite of Briti&s;h pride, will deplore the death of the man who, with &s;trong
<PB N="12" REF="038684_0012_1015B9AB66E77900">
arm rent a&s;under their empire.&mdash;While on the di&s;tant &s;hores of Africa, if they are &s;addened with the report of his death, the &s;ooty native &s;hall ble&s;s the memory of the man who, with his la&s;t breath, emancipated hundreds of their countrymen from the &s;hackles of &s;lavery. But though the world may do ju&s;|tice to his tran&s;cendent merit, it is we alone who can truly feel his lo&s;s. Perhaps the ungenerous policy of European Courts may profit them&s;elves by our lo&s;s; and &s;udden inva&s;ion may &s;ucceed his decea&s;e. If, my fellow citizens, we of this generation &s;hould be again expo&s;ed to the ravages of foreign inva&s;ion; if we &s;hould again &s;ee our towns &s;acked, and our wives and children again driven from their peaceful habitations by a ferocious, foreign &s;oldiery; then &s;hall we truly bemoan the death of WASHING|TON; for then, citizens of America, and then only, will you know the worth of the man you have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT let us not &s;pend our breath in unavailing &s;orrow: let it be ours to profit by his great example.</P>
<P>LET the aged among us, who&s;e gray hairs give certain pre&s;age that they &s;hall &s;oon follow him, con&s;ole them&s;elves with the &s;ure and certain hope that they &s;hall &s;ee him in the world of &s;pirits.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="038684_0013_1015B9ACECAEA8E0">
LET tho&s;e, who are engaged in the active &s;cenes of bu&s;y life, when they would &s;erve their generation, remember WASH|INGTON: and though they may ju&s;tly de&s;pair of imitating this great exemplar, let them reflect that the man who can achieve one &s;olitary deed, or practi&s;e one virtue of WASHINGTON, will de&s;erve well of his country. Let our youth be taught to look to his conduct as their polar &s;tar, in their pa&s;&s;age through the boi&s;terous ocean of human life. And even, my little friends, who came with your parents to weep over the grave of your po|litical father; though you are too young to value his worth, or know your lo&s;s; yet, if you would become the comfort of your parents, and the pride of your country, reflect, and let it ex|cite your emulation, that this unrivalled hero, this delight of every heart, this matchle&s;s WASHINGTON was once an infant in the cra|dle. Tho&s;e lips, which &s;pake a language which would have adorn|ed the Roman Forum in Rome's proude&s;t days, once li&s;ped his native tongue with infantine accent. Once like you he was a pu|pil of the &s;chools, and his expanding virtues were marked only by his preceptors, and perhaps only appreciated by parental affection. Who, at that early day, could have foretold the revolution of our
<PB N="14" REF="038684_0014_1015B9B0A7646190">
country? What prophetic &s;pirit, "rapt into future times," could have pointed to the blooming boy, and &s;aid, in that child you &s;ee the &s;aviour of his country? Five millions of happy people &s;hall ble&s;s him while he lives; a nation &s;hall lament him when he dies.</P>
<P>And who but the Omnifcient can declare that I do not, among the &s;malle&s;t of you, &s;ee &s;ome future &s;tate&s;man who &s;hall give energy to our public councils; &s;ome warrior who &s;hall free our country from inva&s;ion; or &s;ome little WASHINGTON, who, like his great predece&s;&s;or, &s;hall unite all talents and all hearts?</P>
<P>THE hopes of our country, fellow citizens, are in the ri&s;ing gen|eration. In a few more ha&s;ty revolving years, the &s;ages, the warri|ors, the &s;tate&s;men, who conducted our American revolution, will be numbered with the mighty dead. WASHINGTON is not; and Ad|ams &s;tands on the &s;ummit of the age of man, plumes his wings, and prepares to mount to glory. Where are Greene, Warren, Mercer, and Montgomery? Where is the good Chittenden, who founded our &s;tate? Alas! the places which once knew them &s;hall know them no more. Where are the brave Starks and Warner, under who&s;e banners many of you, who now hear me, fought the
<PB N="15" REF="038684_0015_1015B9B314718928">
battles of your country in yonder field of victory, and gave the fir&s;t check to Briti&s;h &s;uperiority in arms?</P>
<P>WHERE are Fay and Walbridge; tho&s;e youthful heroes, who, when the de&s;olating He&s;&s;ians hung over you like a black cloud &s;urcharged with de&s;truction, though new in arms, girded them|&s;elves for war, and, in defence of your property, your wives, your little ones, this plea&s;ant town, and this temple went forth to the fight, fought like veterans, and &s;ealed their country's liberty with their blood. Their precious memory is embalmed in our hearts; but we &s;hall &s;ee their faces no more. Their hope in the hour of di&s;&s;olution was fixed on God and the ri&s;ing generation. The con&s;olation of WASHINGTON in his dying hour was, that he &s;aw the defenders of Liberty growing up around him&mdash;and that the Independence he had e&s;tabli&s;hed would be maintained by our po&s;terity to the late&s;t generation.</P>
<P>LET us not di&s;appoint his dying hopes. On this day, fellow citizens, on this wide extended continent, men of adver&s;e, politi|cal &s;entiment have drowned their animo&s;ity in the tears &s;hed for our common lo&s;s. On this day, good men, unhappily differing about the intere&s;ts of their country, perhaps, equally dear to them
<PB N="16" REF="038684_0016_1015B9B4972FAF28">
all, have forgotten their di&s;like; and, like the children of one great family, are come to weep over their father's grave.</P>
<P>THUS united in affliction, let us be united in love; and at this moment, while we recline over his bier, let us re&s;olve never more to &s;eparate; but to inhabit the goodly heritage, which God has giv|en us, like a band of brothers; and let it add to the glory of our lamented WASHINGTON, that he, who in his life, obtained for us Freedom and Independence, by his death bound us together in one bundle of fraternal love; "So,". &s;hall it be &s;aid of him as it was of the Ifraeliti&s;h man of might, "the dead which he &s;lew at his death, were more than tho&s;e which he &s;lew in his life."</P>
<P>FINALLY, brethren, farewel&mdash;retire to your habitations; and if, perchance, your homes &s;alute you with a father's honoured name; go, call your &s;ons; tell them of WASHINGTON; in|&s;truct them what a debt they owe their ance&s;tors, and make them &s;wear to pay it, by tran&s;mitting down entire, tho&s;e &s;acred rights which WASHINGTON obtained.</P>
