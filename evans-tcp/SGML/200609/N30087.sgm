<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Discreet Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I considered the numerous Quantity of Books, (and who knows how many fruitless ones) which this learned Age hath heaped upon one another, and thereby the great Remissness among Professors in reading, especially Books of this Nature; I was nevertheless for a long
<PB REF="039964_0004_1015C7DEE3FDBAD8">
Time very loath, yea unwilling (as my Friends very well know) to have these Traslations published: Yet the incessant De|sire of some, and the obliging Importunity of others have so far prevailed upon me, that I have been induced to commit them to the Press; not expecting they will meet with a general Reception, or be worthily esteemed of, no, sorrowful Experience, and God's Word teacheth, (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tim.</HI> iv 3.</NOTE>) <HI>That many have itching Ears, and can hardly endure sound Doctrine.</HI> Alas! how is now the Prophesy of <HI>Amos</HI> fulfilled in our Days? (<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Amos</HI> v 10.</NOTE>) How are those <HI>hated in the Gate who faithfully re|buke Sin,</HI> and how are those <HI>shunned who speak uprightly</HI> concerning the State of our souls? O! how unwillingly do the gene|rallity of Professors hear that distinguishing manner of Preaching, and how strange seemeth it to them? As if a Servant of Christ should not any more make a Differ|ence between the (<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> xv 19.</NOTE> <HI>Precious and the Vile.</HI> Thereforefore it may be no great Wonder (but just Cause of Grief) if this Book
<PB REF="039964_0005_1015C7A807324CE8">
should not be acceptable to all its Readers; the more because it never was the Author's Design to please Men, in rocking those fast|er in sleep (<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Amos</HI> vi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>) <HI>who are at Ease in Zion,</HI> by Means of a general or undistinguishing man|ner of Preaching.</P>
<P>As for the Reason why some may take it to be too distinguishing, is perhaps, because they have lived long, or yet live under an undistinguishing Ministry, or because they are not willing to be discovered to them|selves, in having a Knowledge of the State of their Souls, and with the Prodigal, <HI>come to themselves, Luk.</HI> xv 17. in order to go to Christ, and be saved in God's appointed Time and Way. But what Reason soever any one may have, it must nevertheless be granted, that the safest Method which any Ministers can take (who desire to be faith|full to their Lord, and profitable to the immortal Souls committed to their Charge) is to follow the Practice of the Prophets and Apostles, whose Method was <HI>not to use sordid Speeches and enticing Words,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii 4. or to detain their Auditors with a Relation of
<PB REF="039964_0006_1015C7E2131C3E10">
such and such like People being in the World, or in the Church; no, but thire Method was to speak some to the Purpose, and that it might be known what Sort of People they had in View; as, <HI>Thou art the Man,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xii 17. <HI>Thou hast neither Part nor Lot in this Matter, &amp;c. Act.</HI> viii 21. <HI>Thou Child of the Devil, Act.</HI> xiii 10. <HI>Ye foolish Galatians, Gal.</HI> iii 1. <HI>Ye Generation of Vipers, Matt.</HI> iii 7. And such like Ex|pressions. This was also the wholsom Prac|tice of the faithful Ministers in the primi|tive Church, as in their Writings sufficient|ly appears, they not being daunted in the least to drive Peaple into Dispair, as our present <HI>Time-Servers</HI> (as <HI>Rurtherford</HI> calls them) imagine they ought, that's guarded against as if it was the only Way to be lost, whereas Thousands are Lost through Care|lesness, when not one is lost through Di|spair: And it is nevertheless certain, that it is neither God's Word, nor sharp Preach|ing that brings People to Dispair, but their Sins.</P>
<P>And perhaps it will be distasted by others because it is written in too mean a Stile, ap|pearing without any Embelishments of E|rudition,
<PB REF="039964_0007_1015C7AA390CFEE8">
not being adorned with Theolo|gical Expressions: But know, that the Au|thor (as the Learned who know him testi|fy) may nevertheless be numbered among the Rabbies in <HI>Israel;</HI> and that he is never at a Loss to utter himself in all manner of suitable Expressions, both in a Rhetorical and Theological Way, when Occasion so re|quires. But he has always thought it more proper and as his Duty, to express himself in such a plain manner, as he might be best understood by his Auditors, even by those of the meanest Capacity.</P>
<P>And although his manner of Preaching is not to stuff up his Sermons with eloquent Expressions, such as are of Men's Composing&punc; yet his fluency of Preaching is well known and his exceeding Talent, of drawing on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Matter out of another, thereby discovering the State and Condition of his Auditors to themselves (as Experience can plainly evi|dence, and) as by the following Discourses may sufficiently appear: But in this as in a great many more Translations, the Grace and Fluency of the Stile of the Original is much lost in the Translation, which the Translator is Sorry to say, in this is occa|sioned
<PB REF="039964_0008_1015C7E39E77BE60">
by his Want of Letters and Practice in such Cases, this being the first Time that he ever took in Hand to translate&punc; yet he hath, as far as his Capacity would allow, kept to the Substance of the Matter.</P>
<P>But not to be tedious, and as I said be|fore, although it is not Expected, that this Treatise will be generally accepted, yet it may be desired by many, if it was only with <HI>Herod, to hear what this Troubler of Israel would say,</HI> yet it may be and is Earnestly prayed for, that instead thereof they may therein find Sweetness for their Souls and bring them to Salvation in an Effectual manner.</P>
<P>But if any of it's Readers should hap|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n to stand in the Ways asking <HI>for the old Paths,</HI> Enquiring <HI>where they good Way is being</HI> desireous <HI>to walk therein,</HI> Is. vi 16. I doubt not but that those will through the Lord's Blessing find sweet and sure Di|rections and rest for their wearied Souls. And whereas this Book is but small, plain and also Clear, therefore I think it needless to give a large Description of the Subject Matter treated on.</P>
<P><PB REF="039964_0009_1015C7AC6B330178">
That which next and Chiefly concer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> us, is to pray unto the Lord that he would in his Mercy be pleased to accompany this Book with his Blessing, and that he would graciously be pleased to give all of us suitalble Hearts to take Notice of those great and saving Truths treated of in the following Sermons: In them (if wee may say) our Lamps are viewed, our Gold so tryed and our eternall Weight laid in the Ballance O! my Friends! If we <HI>were wise we would Consider our latter Ends</HI> Deut. xxxii. 29. And would esteeme i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Happiness that we still have such Men among us who do so faithfully treat us concerning our eternall State; the more be|cause there is so few such to be found in these our Dayes who set forth truly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their Auditors the Condition of their Souls&punc; I'ts true there be some who often endeavour to discover their Hearers, but they are ge|nerally gross, notorious Sinners, or else the Failings, if not the false Accusations of the Pious, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Perhaps that they might be Despised of by the world; but as for the Rest as if they were all good Christi|ans, at least as if they were afraid to dis|quiet
<PB REF="039964_0010_1015C7E527DA4928">
them, for it seems as if nothing else was required than a Form of Godliness, and therewith they are contented, although the Power thereof is denied, if not scoffed at and opposed in those who endeavour to practice it.</P>
<P>But not to exceed the Limnits of a Pre|face, I shall draw to a Conclusion: Desire|ing thee, discreet Reader&punc; to Accept of this small Treatise as a Fruit of the Author's real Love to the saving of thy Soul especi|ally those of, and near his own Congrega|tion, to whom this Book is especially De|dicated; and you need not Question but that the Reverend Author hath often been great|ly concerned for you; his Heart, without Doubt, hath often been seized with Com|passion in seeing, and hearing of your mi|serable and deplorable Conditions, especially for your great Want of a pure evangelical Ministry, seeing your Wanderings <HI>like lost Sheep having no Shepherd,</HI> and lying open for all manner of Errors; the which, as you may realy blieve, often caused him to bend his Knees to God to have Mercy on you in that respect. And who knows but you will not reap the Fruits thereof, nay,
<PB REF="039964_0011_1015C7AEF683EAD8">
how has the Lord favoured you since with many, yea, pure means of Grace so <HI>that the Lord is even now found of them who sought him not. O that your Souls might live by these things,</HI> Is. xxxxiii. 16. And O! that these few Leaves might to that end be blessed of the Lord, if it was only <HI>as a Hand full of Corn upon the Top of the Moun|tains, the Fruit thereof nevertheless shake like Lebannon, Ps.</HI> lxxii.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>P<HI>Recious Things are Difficult to be obtained,</HI> was once a Proverb of the Antients. The Truth of this is e|vident in Things natural, even as Diamonds and white Pearl are dif|ficult to obtain: But this is also evident in Things Moral, even as Wisdom and Virtue are
<PB N="2" REF="039964_0014_1015C7EBC8001880">
the most excellent upon Earth; for the more a Man possesseth thereof, the more acceptable he is in the Eyes of God, of Angels, and of Men; therefore <HI>Solomon</HI> sets such a Value upon it, <HI>Prov.</HI> iii 13,&mdash;19. But with what Difficulty are Things Spiritual obtained? For certainly there is Nothing more beautiful, Nothing more dear, Nothing more amiable, than those Spiritual Ce|lestial Things which are with God in Christ. But how difficult is it to obtain them, since they must be fought for, and <HI>Violence used for the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> in order <HI>to take it with Violence, Mat.</HI> xi.</P>
<P>This is likewise seen in that <HI>Merchant,</HI> who went <HI>and sold all that he had, to purchase that Pearl which was in the Field, Mat.</HI> xiii 44, 45. This <HI>Paul</HI> also sheweth, <HI>Know ye not, that they which run in a Race, run all, but one receiveth the Prize? So run that ye may obtain.</HI> And what was the Prize they were to run for? The incorruptible Crown of Glory which was han|ged up at the End of the Race, and that is the Salvation which God giveth to his Childeren af|ter this Life. And this is compared to a Crown, because God giveth them there the Victory over all their Enemies, and delivereth them from all Conflicts and painful Labour: But as long as they continue here upon Earth, it is unto them <HI>A Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ey of Tears, a Way of much Tribulation.</HI></P>
<P>And this is clearly seen, if we do but cast an Eye on the Divine Words of the Text, wherein
<PB N="3" REF="039964_0015_1015C7B3A1B7ED70">
the Apostle sheweth, <HI>That the Righteous are sa|ved,</HI> altho' <HI>scarcely,</HI> that is, through many Con|flicts, with much Difficulty. In the foregoing Verses the Apostel had shown the sorrowful and wretched End that will certainly befall the Un|godly, that are disobedient to the Gospel: But to show the Difference, he says in the Words o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Text, that the Righteous shall not have such an End, but that they shall be <HI>saved,</HI> although <HI>scarcely:</HI> But as concerning the ungodly Sinner he shall be lost. Therefore he joyns these Word to the Words preceeding, with the Word [<HI>And If the Righteous scarcely be saved, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Two Cases are here to he taken notice of.</P>
<P N="1">I. The State of the Righteous, <HI>That they shall be saved, although scarcely.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The wretched state of the Ungodly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Sinners.</P>

Prov.</HI> xx 9. This every righteous Person with Shame, Grief and Sorrow must experimentaly confess, which <HI>Paul</HI> lamented, <HI>Rom.</HI> vii 21. <HI>I find then a Law, that when I would do good, evil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> present with me.</HI> And as the Church likewise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ith, <HI>Is.</HI> lxiv.

Therefore <HI>Job</HI> saith, <HI>Job</HI> ix 2. <HI>How should a Man be just with God.</HI> And <HI>David Ps.</HI> cxxx.</P>
<P>Much less is understood by the <HI>Righteous</HI> those who justify themselves, and think they are <HI>Righ|teous,</HI> as was the Condition of the <HI>Pharisee, Luk.</HI>

xviii 9. But by the <HI>Righteous</HI> are here under|stood,</P>
<P N="1">1. Such Sinners who although in themselves Ungodly, having no Righteousness whereby to stand in the Judgment of God, but who through Faith have received the Righteousness of the Lord Jesus, whereby they are acquitted from the Guilt and Punishment of Sin, and have obtained a Title to Eternal Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>Righteous Person</HI> is such an one who be haveth himself conformable to this Righteous|ness, and does what is Right and Just according to Gods Law, and so <HI>is filled with the Fruits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Righteousness, Phil.</HI> i 11.</P>

<P N="2">II. BY the Word <HI>Save</HI> in general is understood to <HI>preserve any one, to deliver or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="6" REF="039964_0018_1015C7F0273523D0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from any Evil, and to bring him over to Hap|piness and Well-being;</HI> and that in respect either upon temporal Deliverances, as <HI>Mat.</HI> viii 25. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hen the Disciples said, <HI>Lord save us, we perish,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon mortal Diseases, as <HI>James</HI> v 15. <HI>The prayer of Faith shall save the Sick;</HI> or upon hea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y Persecutions and hard Tribulations, <HI>Mat.</HI> xiv 22. But in the New Testament it is ge|nerally taken for the <HI>Preservation of the Soul to eternal Life:</HI> From whence Jesus is called <HI>The Saviour, Mat.</HI> 1 21.</P>
<P>But in this Place we must not understand a temporal Salvation, or corporal Deliverance, al|though the Righteous are sometimes&punc; Partakers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ereof; as <HI>Noah</HI> from the Waters of the Deluge: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot</HI> out of <HI>Sodom:</HI> The three Children out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fiery Furnace: <HI>Daniel</HI> out of the Lions Den: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd <HI>Peter</HI> out of Prison: Which (as Exemples) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ere delivered from such Disasters.

Now as Damna|tion comprehends in it the highest Evil, so Sal|vation comprehends in it the highest Good, which is the Fellowship with God, which the righteous do here partake of in Grace, and here|after in Glory. It is that Salvation, that great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ood <HI>which cannot be written with Pen, nor utter|ed
<PB N="7" REF="039964_0019_1015C7B61792DDC8">
with Tongue:</HI> And therefore we can say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more of it, than, <HI>O how great is thy Goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, Ps.</HI> xxxi.</P>
<P>This Salvation the Apostle puts without Disputed that the Righteous shall enjoy, and so it is in Truth: <HI>For to be Righteous is the Way to Salva|tion.</HI> And this appears</P>
<P N="1">1. Because he is acquitted from the Guilt and Punishment of Sin, and become an Heir of E|ternal Life, and also saved in Hope. Thus saith <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> viii 33. <HI>Who shall lay any thing to the Charge of Gods Elect? It is God that justifi|eth.</HI> And so <HI>David</HI> discribeth the Blessed|ness of <HI>the Man unto whom God imputeth Righ|teousness without Works.</HI> And this is a perfect Righteousness, and can stand in Gods Judgment therefore the Church was so Rejoyced, <HI>Jes.</HI> lx 10. saying, <HI>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Righteous are such who through Faith are in Christ, and thereby justified in him, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Just shall live by his Faith, Hab.</HI> ii 4. And b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Consequence, they are only the Believers, <HI>For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that believeth on the Son hath Life everlasting, Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> iii 36. The Righteous are such Persons who are sanctified through the Spirit of God, <HI>He that doet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Righteousness,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> iii 7. <HI>That followeth after it,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> vi 11. <HI>And walk in all the Command|ments and Ordinances of the Lord, Luk.</HI> i 6. Now as <HI>without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord Heb.</HI> xii 14 Then consequently those who are
<PB N="8" REF="039964_0020_1015C7F25A94D710">
<HI>Partakers of Sanctification</HI> will certainly <HI>see the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Rightoeus are also a Godly People, and <HI>Godliness hath not only the Promise of the Life that now is, but also of Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e Eternal wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h is to come,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv 8. And thus it is certain that the Righte|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ons are saved, and they only.</P>
<P N="3">III.

to Gods Law, and the Law requires a strict and precise Godliness. So then, let us see how the <HI>Righteous are scarcely saved.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. With Trouble and much Difficulty are the Righteous saved: For shall they be saved they they must be born again, <HI>Joh.</HI> iii 3. God cannot save them unless he first Spiritually enlivens them, <HI>who by Nature are dead in Tres|passes and Sins, Eph.</HI> ii. Verily there is such Power required in transforming and regenerating of Sinners, as there was required in creating the whole World: Yea, much greater! For in the Creation there was nothing that was against God; but now all that is in a Sinner is <HI>in Enmity against God, Rom.</HI> viii 7.</P>
<P N="2">2. Shall he be saved he must believe; now that is only a Work of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> vi 29. And what belongs not thereto when a Man shall be brought to God, who conceits so much of himself and behaves himself in all his Words and Actions as if he was God himself! What belongs not there|to, to abase and humble haughty and arrogant Man, and cause him like a poor Beggar to creep as a Worm, and so to beg God for Mercy. <HI>Judas</HI> rather chose the Halter than to believe. O! what belongs not thereto, for one who depends upon his own Righteousness, and thereon is at Ease, to throw him off from his false Grounds, and to strip him naked, and drive him out of himself, as one helpless, desperate and lost, in order to lay hold on Jesus, and so through him to make Peace
<PB N="11" REF="039964_0023_1015C7B99E4B6EA0">
with God, to be only saved through the perfect Righteousness of Jesus. It is hard to desire Christ, and to desire nothing else but Christ. It is Diffi|cult to follow Christ all the Day, and never to be at Rest until he is found; and therefore, if we shall believe, certainly <HI>the Arm of the Lord must be revealed, Jes.</HI> liii Therefore <HI>Paul</HI> also saith, <HI>Eph.</HI> i 19, 20. <HI>That the Work of Faith is an ex|ceeding Greatness of God's Power, according to the Working of his mighty Power which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the Dead.</HI> And therefore it is <HI>Scarcely.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Shall he be saved, he must be converted, ac|cording to <HI>Luk.</HI> xiii. 3. And what belongs not thereto? For he must turn from Sin to Virtue from Satan to God, from himself and all Crea|tures to Christ? and what is it not a Work for one who is in Darkness, yea even Darkness it self who cannot find the Way of Life who is unable and unwilling to return, who is so blind through Self love that he calleth his evil Heart good that hath such a salse Hope, from which he can|not nor will not depart, who is so captivated <HI>in the Snare of the Devil, taken Captive by him at his Will,</HI> 2 Tim. ii 26. who is a Child of Wrath, who is an Enemy of God. O! what be|lons not thereto to stay such an ungodly, care|less Sinner iu that his Way in order to awaken him. O! what belongs not there unto for such an one who hath forgoten and dispised God and has caused God to be his Enemy, who can

expect nothing else but Gods Wrath to Eternity, to bring such an one again to God, that he might see and enjoy his Favor and Love. Will he not think, <HI>How shall I again become recon|ciled with God, whereas I am an Enemy, a Ha|ter of God, when I shall appear before his Holy Presence will be not then forthwith reject me and cast me into Hell? Should God have a Desire to save such a Sinner as I am?</HI> And therefore it is a difficult Work to cause a Sin|ner to believe this, in order to be converted. And therefore he is <HI>Scarcely saved</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Shall he be saved, he must be sanctified for <HI>without Holiness no man shall see the Lord, Heb.</HI> xii 14. And what appertains thereto what Pains and Labour must not the Holy Spirit be|stow to sanctify the elect Sinner; for within and without he is wholly unclean, and loathsom, <HI>from his Head to his Feet there is no soundness in him,</HI> Jes. i 6. And thus he must not onely to be sanctified in all what he does and leaves undone, yielding of his Members as <HI>Instruments of Righteousness,</HI> and thereby to forsake all, <HI>cuting off his right Hand, plucking out his Eye, Matt.</HI> v. that is to leave his most beloved Sins: But he must also besanctifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed inwardly, his Heart must be changed and wholly subverted, Gods Image must be impressed therein, he must be holy in all his Aims to glorify God in all Things.

Sin, to Vanity and Folly, and now to sanctify it to a stedfast Wisdom, this requireth a Divine Power. And therefore he is <HI>scarcely saved.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. He is <HI>scarcely saved,</HI> because he must deny himself, <HI>Matt.</HI> xvi 24. <HI>If any Man will come after me, let him deny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">imself, and take up his Cross and follow me,</HI> that is in general the old <HI>Adam,</HI> the Flesh with the Affections and Lusts must be crucified, <HI>Gal.</HI> v 24. He must bring his Knowledge in to Captivity to the Obedience of Christ, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> x 5. He must forsake his own Will, he must forsake his Affections Lusts and Pleasues, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii 11. <HI>Ep.</HI> iv 24. and 5 11. we must also deny our Honour, Goods and Friends for Christ, yea even our own Lives, see, <HI>Luk.</HI> xiv 26. <HI>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Chil|dren and Brethren and Sisters, yea, his own Life also, he cannot be my Disciple.</HI> How hard is that for a Sinner whose Heart is like unto a Stone, and yet this must be done, and therefore he is <HI>scarcely saved.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6 Because he must be heavenly minded, and forsake all Things visible for Things invisible, with <HI>Paul, count all Things but loss and Dung for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ,</HI> Phil. iii to disdain the Favour of Men, the Treasures, Riches and pleasures of this World, and onely seek <HI>those things which are above where Christ siteth, Col.</HI> iii 1. 2. and to extol Jesus above ten Thousand, and make him thus

known unto the World. But O! what a La|bour doth that require. and therefore he is <HI>scarcely saved.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7 He is <HI>scarcely saved,</HI> because he must love God above all, and his Neighbour as himself, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxii 37. 40. he must <HI>bless them that curse him, do good to them that hate him, Matt.</HI> v 44. But what a difficult Thing is that, e|ven to love his Enemies. And therefore he is <HI>scarcely saved.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8 With Trouble and Difficulty he is saved in himself, since it's very difficult for a Man who is mortally sick to begin o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> perfom any Labour, yea <HI>as little as an Ethiopian can change his Skin, or a Leopard his Spots,</HI> Jer. xiii 23. <HI>So little can they do Good who are accustomed to do Evil.</HI> They are Dead, and can do nothing to|wards their Quickning, so mortally unable are they: Therefore Paul saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> vii 14. <HI>I am carnal Sold under Sin.</HI> And therefore <HI>Scarcely saved.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9 Hereby cometh the Fickleness and the Va|riableness of Man, when he is convinced of God, then they resolve to behave themselves otherwise, and commit that Sin no more, but their Design against that Sin goes over again, and thus re|turn to folly. And so that sorrow is <HI>as a morning Cloud that soon passes away.</HI> And therefore <HI>he is scarcely saved.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10 Scarcely and with much Difficulty are the Righteous saved; and beeause God sometimes

Then they are busied with Complaning and Lamenting, asking and seeking, striving and wrestling. This is seen in <HI>Job.</HI> vi 2-4 and xiii. 24 in <HI>David, Ps.</HI> xiii 1-3.

<P N="11">11 With dificulty they are saved, because they meet with many Temtations and Eencounters of Satan, for <HI>the Devil their Adversary goeth a|gainst them as a roaring Lion,</HI> Pet. v 8. He is nimble and deceitfull and always Vigilant and constantly aims at their destruction, and maketh it his Business to draw them off from God. Therefore in a secret manner he shooteth his venemous Dart at them, to cause them to sin,

and to oppose or defile which is good, that it should not be rightly performed, or darts into them blasphemous Thoughts that he might lift their Faith, and to bring them to Dispair and Doubts. How they must arm themselves a|gainst it, can be seen, <HI>Ep.</HI> vi 10. 18. It's then <HI>scarcely.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12 Thereby cometh the World <HI>which lieth in wickedness</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> v. 19. that is the wicked People with their sinfull Companions, who are as Satans Instruments for all what's he cannot do himself, that he does thro' them as his Instru|ments, for <HI>he rules in the Children of disobedi|ence,</HI> and these he stireth up to destroy the Godly: At one time representing unto them by false Flatteries all with handsom, honoura|ble profitable to entice Souls: At other times persecuting them with wicked Slanders and dis|dainfull Lies and evil Threatnings, which the Righteous must so much suffer of the Wicked, and that for the name of Christ, <HI>Matt.</HI> v. 11. 1 Pet. ii 19, 20. an thus <HI>they must go thro' a good and evil Report,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi 8. and all this they must overcome, which can never be with|out striving, <HI>Therefore it's scarcely.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13 Moreover they have also got a deceitful, seducing and subtil Heart, that evil and cor|rupted Nature which constantly turneth them aside. <HI>For the Heart is deceitful yea mortally deceitful above all Things, Jer.</HI> xvii 19. <HI>Js.</HI> xxxxii 20. <HI>so every one that is tempted is drawn

<P>their Deaths; O what is the Difference infinitely gheat when they dye? What a Difference is there between the Righteous and Ungodly at their Deaths?

<P N="2">II. <HI>Their unhappy State, where shall they ap|pear.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I.

But this Difference is uncertain, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Words <HI>Ungodly</HI> and <HI>Sinners</HI> are often used promiscuously, to signify one and the same Person. By <HI>Ungodly</HI> all Sinners are understood, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv 5&punc; And by <HI>Sinners</HI> are often understood those who Exceed in Ungodliness, who are therefore ranked among <HI>Publicans, Luke</HI> xv 1.

<P>An Ungodly (or <HI>Godless</HI>) then by virtue of the original Word which we find here, is such an one who neither honours nor serves God, as it's usual to call a Man <HI>Uncharitable</HI> who has no Charity, <HI>Remediless</HI> who knows no Remedy, <HI>Graceless</HI> one who has no Grace, and one who is poor and has no Money, <HI>Monyless.</HI></P>
<P>An Ungodly (or Godless) Man then in that Sense, is a Man who is yet in his Natural State,

<P>From all this it is evident, that if a Man i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> distitute of the Right to Life, and adjudged as unrighteous; for to have a Right to Life, is also to have a Portion in the Spirit of Life, and there|fore an Ungodly Man is not only <HI>without God,</HI> but likewise <HI>without Christ,</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI> puts it to|gether, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii 12.

as it is said in tho preceeding of verse.

<P>This is the miserable Condition of the Ungod|ly and Sinners, that he not onely can not appear in God's Judgment hereafter, but also in this Life can no where appear with Comfort or any Confidence for <HI>Solomon</HI> in his Proverbs, (from whence Peter cites these Words) in general sets his Mischief before him, Prov. xi 31. <HI>Behold the Righteous shall be recompensed in the Earth: much more the Wicked and the Sinner.</HI> So that the Ungodly and Sinner cannot appear any where even here upon Earth, but with Horror and Fear.</P>
<P N="1">I The Ungodly Sinner cannot with any Con|fidence or child like Affiance appear before God in Prayer; for <HI>we know that God heareth not Sinners,</HI> Joh. ix 31 <HI>his Prayers is an abomination to the Lord,</HI> Prov. 14. 8. <HI>He that turneth away his Ear from hearing the Law, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is Prayer shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e abomination,</HI> Prov. xxviii 9. <HI>And altho

He comes not to do what the Lord shall speak, but to reprove, or to harden his Heart against it, for he continues in his Sins, and will do the Lust of his Heart, therefore the Lord saith to the Pro|phet <HI>Ezekiel, And they come unto thee as the Pe|ople cometh, and they sit before the as my People, and they hear thy Words, but they will not do them,</HI> Ezek, xxxiii 31.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the Ungodly and Sinner will also ap|proach the Holy Supper (as they alas also do) O miserable! the Seal of Grace becomes to them a Singn of Damnation. <HI>The Table becometh a Snare unto them, they eat and drink Damnation to themselves, because they discern not the Lord's Body,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi 29.

<P N="4">4. But when Death comes, <HI>where shall then the Ungodly and Sinner appear?</HI> How shall he be able to stand? Death will be unto him <HI>a King of Terrors,</HI> who will make an End of him, where|by his best will cease and his Worst draw near, because he has lived as an ungodly Person, he shall dye as one <HI>Accursed.</HI> O how terrible are the Thoughts of Death unto him, whose Portion is in this Life! How terrible will approaching Death be unto him! Even as <HI>Balshazzer</HI> when he saw the Hand that wrote on the Wall, <HI>Dan.</HI> v 6. <HI>Then the Kings Countenance was changed, and his Throughts troubled him, so that the Joints of his Loins were loosed, and his Knees smote one against another.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. But where shall he appear in the Day of Judgmen? 'Tis true he shall rise again, but it will be <HI>to Shame and everlasting Contempt, Dan.</HI> xii 2. He shall likewise appear before the Judg|ment Seat, but like a <HI>Goat,</HI> he will be placed on the <HI>left Hand,</HI> where they will not be able to bear the strict Examination of the Omniscient Judge nor the Lawful Judgment of the Omnipotent, when they shall <HI>give an Account of every idle Word, Mat.</HI> xii 36. Therefore they will be speechless, and the Judge will pronounce this Sentence, <HI>Depart from me ye cursed into everlast|ing Fire, prepared for the Divil and his Angels;</HI> the which will be immediately executed, and <HI>they

Hell the Place of the Damned, that is his own Place, which is prepared for him, to continue there forever, but not able to subsist by reason of the revenging Justice of God, who will punish them: O miserable Wretches! who must there appear, how shall his Laughter be turned into Mourning! his short Prosperity be rewarded with neverending Curses, when he shall there appear! Alas! then he will howl by reason of the Pain of his Heart, gnawing his Tongue by reason of the unexpressible Anguish and Pain, gnashing upon his Teeth, <HI>cry out to the Mountains and Rocks, fall upon us, Rev.</HI> vi.</P>
<P>And this necessarily follows; for <HI>if the Righte|ous are but scarcely saved,</HI> then certainly the <HI>Un|godly and Sinner</HI> shall be lost, as the Apostle con|cludes. A <HI>Righteous one</HI> differeth as much from an <HI>Ungodly and Sinner,</HI> as <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Hell, as Light and Darkness,</HI> therefore their latter Ends are also very different. Must a Righteous Person endure so many Tribulations, what will then not happen to an ungodly Sinner, who yet lives in his Sins, if those who love God sustain so many Sufferings and Oppresions, what will he not do to him who hates him and is his Enemy? If God is pleased so sensibly to visit and chasten his Chil|dren and Favourites, by reason of their Failings, O! how then shall not God avenge himself of his Adversarie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by reason of all their Sins and evil Deeds which they have done in all their Lives?
<PB N="46" REF="039964_0056_1015C81F2E392CF8">
Such a Resolution is also taken by the wise King <HI>Solomon, Prov.</HI> xi 31. <HI>Behold the Righteous shall be recompen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd in the Earth, much more the Wick|ed and Sinner.</HI> An Ungodly one <HI>is without God, estranged from the Life of God,</HI> whom he neither fears nor serves, therefore there is no Comfort nor Salvation for him.

<BIBL>Prov. XIV 12.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>There is a way that seemeth right to a Man: But the end thereof are the ways of Death.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>REMARKABLE and not less certain are the Words of the Pro|phet <HI>Jeremiah, Jer.</HI> xvii 9. <HI>The Heart is deceitful above all Things, and desperately wicked, who can know it?</HI> By the Heart must be understood the Soul of Man, that Reasonable Being, endued
<PB N="66" REF="039964_0074_1015C839A45BA5D0">
with Understanding, Judgment, Conscience, Will and Desires: Now this Heart of Man after the Fall, as long as it is not renewed by the Spirit of Regeneration, is</P>
<P><HI>Deceitful:</HI> The Original Word that stands here is the same whence the Patriarch <HI>Jacob</HI> derived his Name from, because he in his Birth had hold of his Brother's Heel; but it likewise signifies <HI>Subtilty, Craft, Fraud, Snares, Jos.</HI> viii 13. <HI>Gen.</HI> xxvii 36. So that <HI>Deceitful</HI> here signifies <HI>Frau|dulent, Reservation, inclining to deceive.</HI> Thus the Heart is constituted above all, <HI>yea, deadly,</HI> tending to Death, <HI>whereunto Death is fastned, un|curable, evil above Measure:</HI></P>
<P>So deceitful and corrupted are the Hearts of Men, the which they make manifest when they deceive themselves and others, in concealing and hiding of their subtile Wickedness. When <HI>He|rod</HI> int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ded to Murder Christ, he feigned him|self as if he would worship him, <HI>Matt.</HI> ii 8. <HI>Judas</HI> covered his Covetuousness with an Affecti|on to the Poor. If they cannot wholly conceal the Evil of their Sins, then they lessen them; hence proceeds all Hypocrisy, by which they ap|pear as if they were something: But that which doth manifest the Deceitfulness of the Heart more naked, is Self-Deceit, through which People think, that they are not so bad as indeed they are, and think they be in a good State, and hope to be saved, whenas they are indeed yet miserable Oblects of Damnation.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="039964_0075_1015C87719B350B0">
So it was with the Church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> they <HI>thought themselves rich and increased with Goods, and to have need of nothing;</HI> and notwithstand|ing were <HI>poor, miserable naked, and blind, Rev.</HI> iii 17. <HI>If a Man</HI> (saith St. <HI>Paul</HI>) <HI>think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself, Gal.</HI> vi 3. A Deceit really which is ve|ry common, and likewise very dangerous: For in this Case, a Man, through Deceit of his Heart, is <HI>as a Man who is Hungry and thirsty, and in his Sleep dreameth that he eateth and drinketh, but when he awakes finds himself deceived, and still feels his Hunger and Thirst, Is.</HI> xxix 8. Thus also will the deceitful Heart, who thought it had been in the Favour of God, after Death and in the Day of Judgment be sensible of it's Deceitfulness, that its Imaginations have only been as a Dream, when he with an imaginary Heaven shall open his Eies in Hell. That a Man perswadeth him|self to be a Believer, without any Grounds, makes him the more wretched; it is deplorable, that this Deceit which is so dangerous, is likewise so common.</P>
<P>From hence saith <HI>Solomon</HI> in the Words of our Text, <HI>There is a Way that seemeth right unto a Man, but the End thereof are Ways of Death.</HI> Words which cantain in themselves a (faithful and) true-hearted Warning, that every one that dreads for Self-Deceit, to be not deceived in his Expectation and become ashamed at the coming of the Lord Jesus, may well press upon his Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="039964_0076_1015C83B31BC9310">
<HI>Two principle Things we have here to take No|tice of.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The Proposal, <HI>There is a Way that seemeth right to a Man.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The definitive Sentence, <HI>But the End there|of are the Ways of Death.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Proposal</HI> we are more nearly to consider of what is spoken, to wit, <HI>A Way,</HI> and then the Imagination which a Man hath of it, namely, <HI>That it seemeth right unto him.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Way</HI> is a manner of doing, or of living, which a Man useth, wherein he hath pro|posed to himself to attain some certain End; for a Traveller useth a Way as the Means to attain his proposed End; and thus we find mention made several times in the Holy Scriptures of <HI>Two Ways</HI> a <HI>broad</HI> and a <HI>narrow Way,</HI> and two sorts of Travellers, with their final Ends, we find, <HI>Ps.</HI> i 6. The <HI>the Lord knoweth the Way of the Righteous</HI> (their Actions and manner of liv|ing) <HI>but the Way of the Ungodly shall perish,</HI> that is their Life and Actions.</P>
<P>Now there is a Way, a manner of living that <HI>seemeth right unto a Man,</HI> and notwithstanding hath a miserable End. <HI>Solomon</HI> here hath his Eye upon those People who deceive themselves, expressed with that Word <HI>a Man.</HI> And he un|derstands by such a Man, such as he here, and in other Places calls <HI>Fools,</HI> as in <HI>Prov.</HI> xii 15. Which are not enlightned, not having the Wis|dom
<PB N="69" REF="039964_0077_1015C878A3E4A8E0">
which is from above, without the Fear of God, therefore natural People whom he also call|eth <HI>Ungodly;</HI> in a Word, unconverted People, which is evident, because he ascribes unto them a miserable End. These have a Way, a Manner of living, wherein they propose to themselves a wrong End; on the one side aiming at earthly Happiness, Riches, Honour and Delight; <HI>This is their inward Thoughts, that their Houses shall continue forever, Ps.</HI> xlix 11. Who <HI>make a God of their Belly, who mind earthly things, Phil.</HI> iii 19. They are <HI>more Lovers of Pleasures, than Lovers of God,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii 4. In a Word they are Men of this World <HI>who have their Portion in this Life, Ps.</HI> xvii 14. And on the other side, they likewise aim at Heaven and everlasting Happiness, name|ly, when they can keep the Earth no longer, then they would fain have Heaven, only to be delivered from Hell. And thus their <HI>Way which seemeth right unto them,</HI> is</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Way of Sin,</HI> or a living in Sin, so that they give their Lusts the full Sway, and follow their corrupt evil Nature, know nothing of cru|cifying the Flesh, live in Envy, Strife, Hatred, Drunkenness, Revenge, Lying and Backbiting, (although one more than another) in one Word, such a Life wherein they willfully retain some Sins; thus <HI>David</HI> describes the Way of the Un|godly, <HI>That he deviseth Mischief upon his Bed, he setteth himself in a Way that is not good, he abhorreth not Evil, Ps.</HI> xxxvi 2&mdash;5. That it
<PB N="70" REF="039964_0078_1015C83D1E5E42F0">
is such a Way, is manifest from the event, the which is <HI>Death, now the Wages of Sin is Death, Rom.</HI> vi 23.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Way is also <HI>A Way of Civility and Morality,</HI> thus out of Fear of Hell, Damage or Shame, or of natural Conviction of Conscience, they take heed of notorious gross Sins, and they are very diligent in practising the external and lesser Parts of the Law, and live so that no Body hath any thing to say against them. This can be seen in the rich young Man, <HI>Matt.</HI> xix 19, 20. <HI>All this he had kept,</HI> according to the outward Sense, but they give little heed to the internal Frame of their Hearts, not knowing the Spiritual Sense of the Law, which condemns the least Lust, the which they don't know.</P>
<P N="3">3. It's likewise <HI>a Way of External Godliness,</HI> in the excercising and performing of some Duties which they observe, wherein they seek God daily, and have a Delight in the Knowledge of his Ways, as it is said of the self-deceiving <HI>Jews, Is.</HI> lviii 2. So that at the last Day many shall arise, and say, <HI>Lord, Lord, have we not eat and drunk in thy Presence, and in thy Name have cast out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works, Mat.</HI> vii 22, 23. <HI>Luk.</HI> xiii 26, 27.</P>
<P N="4">4. Yea even this is a W<HI>ay of outward Repen|tance and Conversion,</HI> by which they are Some||times convicted moved and troubled, and con|fess their Sins and weep for them, as <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiv and 25. and with <HI>Agripa</HI> to be almost

<HI>perswaded, Act.</HI> xxvi. and begin to leave some Sins and evil Customs, as <HI>Herod,</HI> who <HI>heard John gladly, and did many Things, Mark.</HI> vi. and yet continued Wicked. So that there can be such who through <HI>the Knowledge of Christ have escap|ed the Pollutions of the World,</HI> and still continue in their old <HI>Way of Unconvertedness,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii 20.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is a <HI>Way of Self-Righteousness,</HI> that they do all this to rest thereon, setting their Salvation secure, and justifying their Conscience, and there|with to satisfy God, supposing Heaven will in no wise escape them, having done so much Good&punc; That's it which the Lord saith, <HI>Thou didst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in thy Way, Hos.</HI> x 13.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is a <HI>Way which they have cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en according to their own Judgment,</HI> wherein they are careless&punc; without true Repentance of their Sins, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> narrow Searching of themselves, whereon they seek Self-Honour, Ease and Profit in the World; they practice Religion as much as the World can snare, or out of usual Custom, or for Wellfare's sake or for the sake of others to be seen by them, to pass for an honest Man and a good Christian, or to stop the Mouth of their Conscience to keep it from regret, or even to do God Service there|with, and as it were to oblige him to save them; therefore their whole Life and Actings is yet Sin, because the only live for themselves and not for God, because that they in all their Endeavours have not a right Aim to make <HI>Gods Honour and
<PB N="72" REF="039964_0080_1015C83EE4A03880">
Will</HI> their only Purpose, and thus they are <HI>Lovers of themselves,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii 2.</P>
<P>How perverse also this is, how wretched also this Life is, yet they think that this <HI>Way is right,</HI> and this Life good, as <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, that this Way seemeth right: <HI>That seemeth right to a Man.</HI></P>
<P>These Words according to the Orginal proper|ly signify <HI>before the Face of a Man,</HI> that is in his own Eyes; which Phrase we also find <HI>Eccles.</HI> ii 26. <HI>that is good in his Sight. Solomon</HI> would say <HI>That the unspirtual Man supposeth and thinketh that his Manner of Life and Deeds are good and acceptable unto God, and</HI> (in a Word) <HI>that his Way is right;</HI> he judgeth and means that by him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and he doth not in the least question, but de|pends upon it: For this <HI>Seeming</HI> is no <HI>Guessing,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> it to be <HI>True</HI> and <HI>Certain,</HI> and put it out of <HI>Doubt&punc;</HI> as it is said of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> that they thought <HI>to be heard for their much speaking, Matt.</HI> vi 7. In this Case the Heathen were much mis|taken, however they thought it to be surely so; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> here, he hath hereof an Imagination by him self&punc; he thinks it to be so, and not only hath he that Imagination by himself, but would also that others should hold him as such; therefore with <HI>Herod, he will do many good Things, Mark.</HI> vi. 10. to have a Shew: Thus it was with <HI>Saul,</HI> he would be honoured before the People, as one who retained the Service and Honour of the Lord, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xv 30. So likewise it was with the <HI>Phari|sees,
<PB N="73" REF="039964_0081_1015C87DE5CE6BC8">
Joh.</HI> v 44. So it goes here also with the un|converted Sinner, for he not only thinks <HI>that his Way is right,</HI> but also that others should esteem him to be a pious Man, because <HI>he seemeth to be something,</HI> as <HI>Simon the Sorcerer</HI> said of himself, <HI>That he was some Great One, Act.</HI> viii 9. So it was with the <HI>Jews,</HI> who supposed <HI>that they were Abraham's Seed,</HI> and yet <HI> did not do his Works, but were of their Father the Devil, Matt.</HI> iii, <HI>Joh.</HI> viii. So is it likewise with the unspiritual nomi|nal Christian, it seemeth likewise unto him, <HI>that his Way is right,</HI> and that he shall be saved, and in the Mean Time he is quite out of the Way.</P>
<P>Here we can trace the Causes, or what sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be the Reasons why the Sinner, with such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Immaginations deceiveth himself, and thinks <HI>that his Way is right,</HI> notwithstanding God in his Word makes such a clear Difference between <HI>the broad and the narrow Way,</HI> that is between the <HI>Way af the Ungodly and the Way of the Righte|ous,</HI> between <HI>a natural Estate and a State of Grace,</HI> between those <HI>that Fear God, and those who fear him not;</HI> so that the State of one differ|eth as much from the other, as <HI>Light and Dark|ness, Heaven and Hell;</HI> the Reasons are many, some of them we shall examine.</P>

<P N="2">(2) Is this your Ground, that you firmly hold and do not doubt, but that Christ is your Saviour, and that you shall be saved, and you suppose that these strong Imaginations are a true Faith, and therefore that you are a Believer; but know that this Ground is false, <HI>Satan</HI> that Subtile De|ceiver, and our own deceitful Hearts may per|swade us to this and miserably deceive us; as it is no Proof that any one is wise, because he thinks himself wise, but on the contrary it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> much more a Sign of a Fool; so verily it is no Sign that any one is in a good State&punc; when he conceits that of himself, and belives it; the <HI>Jews</HI> said, <HI>we are Abrahams Children,</HI> and called God <HI>their Father,</HI> although Jesus on the contrary told them, <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil, Joh.</HI> vii.

<P N="4">4 Or is this your Evidence that your Way seemeth right unto you; Because you are very religious, pray often, often and willingly hear and read Gods Word, give many Alms, these are necessary and profitable Things, but always no Evidence that we are in a good Way, and in a good State: For then the way of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Scribes</HI> must have been right, or their State good, because many of them made a great Work of such Duties, so far that they (as Christ teach|eth) out of devotion <HI>prayed often, fasted twice a a Week,</HI> Luk. xviii. <HI>and gave mang Alms:</HI> The Saviour teacheth <HI>that we can preach Gods Word do Miracles, go to the Lord's Supper and that notwithstanding he will say to many of those, I never knew you,</HI> Matt. vii. yea the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>though I bestowed all my Goods to feed the Poor,</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. thus giving to understand that a Man not onely can be free from gross Sins, and diligently can use all religious Means, but can come so far as to give all his Goods to the Poor, and can give himself over <HI>to be Burnt</HI> for the Truth, without being in a good State and have right to Salvation.</P>
<P N="5">5 Or is this your principle that you have De|light and Joy in God's Word, that you have been afraid, troubled, distressed, moved and sorrowful, and that you can weep for your Sins, but know
<PB N="86" REF="039964_0094_1015C85321CF2E90">
that all these things are no sufficient Ground to have Right to Salvaiion, for the Lord Jesus shews that the temporary Beliver <HI>can likewise receive the word with joy,</HI> Luk. viii. <HI>Felix trem|bled when Paul preached to him of Judgment,</HI> Acts. xxiv. <HI>Agrippa, hearing Paul preach was al|most perswaded,</HI> Acts. xxvi. <HI>Saul wept for his Sins and confessed them,</HI> 1 Sam. xvi. 15. and 14. 17. to be troubled, moved and touched and thereupon to become concerned and at a loss about his Salvation that is presently no saving Work of God's Favour, but often comes through a disturbed Conscience and goes over again like a Sea Sickness, whereas all these Things have place in such who are no less than upon the right Way, but a meer unconverted Man; thus it follows of its self that all these Things are no Sufficient Ground that your State is good and and well pleasing to God, and from whence Sal|vation will follow.</P>
<P N="6">6 Or is this your Principle?

<P>Thus you see that these Things are no true and sure Principles whereon a man may conclude his State to be good and conceit to be saved, but that this is <HI>the Way that seemeth right unto a Man, whereof the End are the Ways of Death.</HI> If then you are at ease on these or such like Princi|ples you have hitherto most miserably deceived your self, if you have concluded from any of these Things that your Way is right and your State good, then you have hitherto misled your Soul, and if you still persist in these presumtu|ous Imaginations against all these discoveries you will the more deceive your self and make your self the more wretched.

<P>On the other side is propounded unto you a <HI>narrow Way,</HI> wherein you must deny your self, your own Understanding, own Righteousness, own Will and Mind, own Worthiness and Power, wherein you must depart from your loving Sins, and from the Vanities of this World, wherein you <HI>must seek the Kingdom of God and its Righteous|ness above all Things, Matt.</HI> vi. and <HI>bring forth Fruits worthy of Repentance,</HI> live a precise and

<HEAD>EXPLANATION of the first Part.</HEAD>
<P>POOR (<HI>GNANI</HI>) are by Virtue of the Origi|nal Word, such who are humble, pensive, meek, and hath its Derivation from a Word that
<PB N="103" REF="039964_0108_1015C89DA8A36970">
among others signifies to be abased, oppressed and according to its Original signifieth one who hath such a Frame of Heart as to be bowed down and oppressed in Mind, either under temporal Oppressions, as from a Sense of Sin and Judg|ment, which doth often demonstrate it self in the Lord's People. And thus it agreeth with those who are Meek; therefore <HI>Poor and Meek</HI> are put together, <HI>Jes.</HI> xi 4. A Name wonderously becoming the People of the Lord: For the Be|lievers are Poor, for as much as they are humble, of no puffed up or haughty Temper, but are low and little in Heart, humble in regard of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Countenance and Apparel, also in their Gesture and Talk, also in Mind, and in their common Conversation, as <HI>David,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> vi 22.</P>
<P>And more especially they are humble accord|ing to the Frame of their Souls, <HI>Lord my Heart is not haughty, nor mine Eyes lofty, &amp;c.</HI> When they think upon God, then they cry out with <HI>Job, I abhor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes, Job</HI> xlii 6. When they look on themselves, the Sense of Spiritual Want and inability causes them to see themselves void of all Boasting, seeking their Refuge in the Fullness of <HI>JESUS:</HI> But also the Lords People are <HI>meek,</HI> by Virtue of that low and humble Frame of their Hearts, which is a Fruit of God's Spirit in the Believers, <HI>For the Fruit of the Spirit is Gentleness, Gal.</HI> v 22. which they shew in a friendly Conversation with their Neighbours, without Wrath and Re|venge,
<PB N="104" REF="039964_0109_1015C8DF125E4928">
and in a pliable and yielding Readiness to the Lord's Commandments, and in a patient enduring of Reproaches, of Injuries, Adversi|ties and Oppressions: This is the Reason why the Word <HI>Poor</HI> is also translated <HI>Meek,</HI> for that which in <HI>Zac.</HI> ix 9. rendered <HI>Poor,</HI> is in <HI>Matt.</HI> xxi 5. declared <HI>Meek,</HI> an Evidence that these two Tempers agree in one.</P>
<P>The Believers are poor because they are Op|pressed and miserable, are subject to many Mise|ries and Adversities, sometime with Spiritual, which straiten them in the inward Frame of their Souls, and make them very Fainthearted, some|times with bodily, which outwardly press them, especially Persecution and Bitterness of their Ene|mies: This is the Reason that of Christ's Peo|ple is thus spoken, <HI>Zeph.</HI> iii 12. <HI>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted People, and they shall trust in the Name of the LORD.</HI> This is spoken of the <HI>Jews</HI> that should believe in Christ. <HI>Zach.</HI> xi 11. <HI>And it was broken in that Day: And so the Poor of the Flock that waited upon me knew that it was the Word of the LORD.</HI> The Oppression and Poverty of Believers are put to|gether, <HI>Rev.</HI> ii 9. this is their Lot, <HI>Joh.</HI> xvi 33. This was seen in the first Times of Christendom. How have not the Believers been poor and mi|serable by reason of the many Persecution? All these Things are found in those that are truly Poor.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="039964_0110_1015C8A017399E20">
Poverty in general is <HI>a Want of such Things which a Man hath need of for Sustenance, by which he can subsist;</HI> so that the Poor in gene|ral are such which have Want of Means to live, as necessary Food, Meat, Drink and Cloathing, by which the Body is defended against the In|conveniencies of the Times, as Cold, Heat, Rain and Wind, So that they become necessitated with Anguish, Oppression and Trouble to seek their Sustenance before the Door of another. This is a miserable Condition; this <HI>David</HI> wish|es to his Enemies who rewarded him Evil for Good, <HI>that their Children be continually Vaga|bonds, and beg, and seek their Bread out of their desolate Places, Ps,</HI> cix. 10.</P>
<P>Poverty is twofold Carporal and Spiritual; the Corporal is here not excluded, for often both go together. The Believers ore often Poor ac|cording to the World, their Lot is not always to have much of temperal things, because there is reserved for them other and better Riches; so that Poverty and Need is often their Portion. Riches are often Hinderances to follow <HI>JESUS,</HI> not onely because the Heart is generally too much set thereon, and cleaveth fast thereunto, but also that it is so loath when required with <HI>Moses</HI> to esteem the Disgrace of Christ above the Treasures of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when many are called there|unto with the Rich young Man, <HI>to count those Things but dross and Dung for the Excellency of Christ,</HI> then they <HI>go away sorrowful,</HI> Matt. xix 22.
<PB N="106" REF="039964_0111_1015C8E09C3CBAB0">
This was the Reason that Christ spoke that hard Word, <HI>Matt.</HI> xix 23, 34. It was likewise seen that the most part were poor that did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mbrace the Gospel of Jesus this <HI>James</HI> sheweth us, <HI>James</HI> ii 5. and therefore Christ's People are often of a mean Condition in the World, there|fore it was foretold of him, <HI>that he should turn his Hand upon the little ones,</HI> Zac. xiii 7. <HI>Paul</HI> likewise sheweth this very emphatically, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i 26. 28. They were but Fisher-Men, and the most Part but mean People who were first con|verted to Christ, it was the Multitude and the common People that clave unto him <HI>John,</HI> vii 40, 41. and in process of Time both <HI>Jews and Gentiles</HI> were almost but a mean and disregar|ded People, which easily could leave their Pos|sessions, that imbraced Jesus and the Gospel. The Heathen therefore used to ubraid the Christians for being so Mean and Disregarded: as the <HI>Hea|then C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cilius</HI> upbraided them, <HI>That they were a Company of the Off-scourings and refuse of the Peo|ple, that the most and best of their Adherents were a poor beggarly and hunger starved Generation who had niether Riches or Respect to support themselves.</HI> However this goeth some what too far; for when Christendom some what increased and the Number of true Believers multiplied, there were also several rich and eminent Peo|ple that were brought too; though notwith|standing it's in great Measure true, that the most Part of the Belivers were poor and mean, though not prejudicial to the Gospel.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="039964_0112_1015C8A25E7E03D8">
But because here is not chiefly spoken of tem|poral Poverty, we will enlarge no more upon it but treat of a Spiritual Poverty, as in Truth all Believers are Poor in Spirit that they might become fit Objects of God's Grace and Favour, and thus the Saviour discribes them, <HI>Matt.</HI> v 3. These Poor thenare such who are not onely made bare of all Spiritual Goods, for thus are all People by Nature: It is true, <HI>GOD hath created Man good and upright after his image,</HI> so that he was rich in God, in Knowledge, in Love and in Glory, overflowing with Spiritual Goods, but it did not last long that man continued in that State, he sinned and thus was bereaved of that Image of God, that precious Pearl, those dear Treasures, the Spiritual Raiment was taken from him, de|prived of those inestimable Riches: From hence we are all poor and made naked of those Spiri|tual Goods, and are without Hope of eternal Life <HI>for all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God,</HI> Rom. iii 23. <HI>having the Under|standing darkned, being alienated from the Life of God,</HI> Ep. iv 18. through Sin man is reduced to an Abyss of Want, in a terrible Condition and deep Poverty: And although all men are poor, they are notwithstanding not all <HI>poor in Spirit,</HI> for the most are like drunken People who suppose themselves <HI>Rich and encreased with Goods, and to have Need of nothing,</HI> Rev. iii 17. But these Poor are those who have Know|ledge
<PB N="108" REF="039964_0113_1015C8E29396E868">
of their Spiritual Want, who see and feel this in themselves, they are such,</P>
<P N="1">1 Who have a quickning and convincing Sight of their Spiritual Want, Sin and deserved Pu|nishment and Inability, being sensible of their forlorn and damnable Condition in themselves, and of their Inability, to help themselves so that they can say with David, <HI>Ps.</HI> li. 3. <HI>For I acknowledge my Transgressions, and my Sin is ever before me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 Who under this sense get a low, humble Frame, low and humble in their Mind, Affec|tions and Conversation, having mean Thoughts of themselves, as the truly Poor always have, who do not look on themselves as if they were Something, but are made bare of all, find no Good in themselves, as that <HI>Publican, Luk.</HI> x.</P>
<P N="3">3 They through all this are also driven with|out themselves, become poor Beggars at the Throne of Grace, full of Desire to be filled out of the Fullness of <HI>JESUS,</HI> even as that poor one by the Way side, <HI>Lord Jesus have Mercy on me.</HI> And if they are poor in Body, they with Patience willingly bear it, and esteem it more highly than the Treasures of this World, they are contented with their own, and the Rest they wait for from God <HI>that Father of Lights, from whom cometh every good and perfect Gift from a|bove, James</HI> i 17.</P>
<P>Though they be rich in Earthly Goods, which may go together with Spiritual Poverty, they do
<PB N="109" REF="039964_0114_1015C8A4728F9698">
not set their Hope upon transitory Riches, they do not forget their Charity and Liberality.</P>
<P>These are the Reasons why the People of JESUS, the Favourites of God, are called <HI>Poor.</HI> These are the Poor whereof Christ's Message was to <HI>John the Baptist, The Poor have the Gospel preached unto them, Matt.</HI> xi 5. And those whom he places as Objects of his Fvangelical Commis|sion, <HI>He hath sent me to preach the Gospel to the Poor, Luk.</HI> iv 18.</P>
<P>Those who are thus <HI>poor and naked</HI> must needs be concerned about it, and have a sensible Feel|ing thereof: Therefore the Prophet likewise addeth, <HI>and of a contrite Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>By the <HI>Spirit</HI> must be understood the reasona|ble and immortal Soul of Man, through which he understandeth, wills, and judgeth, in its Mo|tion and inward Frame, and thus the Spirit of Man is that Habit, Frame and Operation, those Passions and Motions which have Place in the Soul, that which we also call the Mind.</P>
<P>The original Word which is translated <HI>contrite,</HI> denotes, to beat, pound, bruise; from hence it's often translated <HI>Destruction,</HI> Ps. lxxxx. 3. to break and grind to Powder, according to, <HI>Js.</HI> xix 10. From whence it appears that it must be improperly understood: For the Soul being Spiritual, cannot properly be broken or bruised: This Word then is borrowed from hard Matter, the which with Strength must be broken
<PB N="110" REF="039964_0115_1015C8E690457378">
and bruised. Now this being brought over to the Soul, giveth to understand the Frame of Hearts. They are before this Bruising, exalted, high-minded, so hard and impliable as a Stone and Diamond, as God's Word likewise saith, <HI>Zac.</HI> vii 12. The <HI>Contrite of Spirit</HI> then are those, who lay down all Loftiness of Mind, Arrogancy, Self-conceitedness, and deeply humble them|selves before the Lord confessing and acknow|ledging to be <HI>Dust and Ashes</HI> unworthy of the least Blessing, being heartily solicitous about their Sins and desirous for Grace; in a contrite Spirit are found.</P>
<P N="1">1 A deep Sense and quickning Knowledge of Sins, by which the Sinner is convinced of his miserable and damnable Condition, Unwor|thiness and manifold Sins, and Inability, so that he feeleth his Sins as a heavy Burthen which press him, through which the Heart becometh sensible, tender, broken and bruised in reflect|ing on the Curse of the Lord and the wrath of God against Sin, the Hammer of God's Law strikes on the Soul: And thus God's Word becometh unto them <HI>as a Hammer and Fire that breaketh the Rock in Pieces,</HI> Jer. xxix 29. From whence proceeds a Sense of Sin, which <HI>as a heavy Bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hen are too heavy,</HI> so that he must say with David, <HI>Ps.</HI> xxxviii.</P>

And this Command went so far, that when the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> suffered but one Person that was unclean among them, to have Communion with them, although they were clean themselves, yea, although they did not know that such an unclean Person was among them, yet in the first Place all Israel were punished, as we see in the Example of <HI>Achan.

For we likewise have a Sanctuary under the New Testament, the Lord's Supper, which is come in stead of the Passeover, of which is earneslly commanded, that no unconverted Person, yet lying in their Pollu|tions, not being sanctified through the Holy Spirit, may come to the same, for the Lord hath threatned a heavy Punishment to all those who unworthily approach to this Sanctuary, and eat thereof: And withal hath charged the Overseers <HI>to keep off the Strangers and Ungodly, and put them out from the Midst of them, that the Cove|nant of God be not prophaned, and that God's Wrath be not kindled against the whole Congrega|tion, and the Lord thus depart from his Congrega|tion

<HEAD>EXPLANATION of the first Part.</HEAD>
<P>CONCERNING the first Part the Intruc|ter asketh, <HI>For whom is the Lord's Supper instituted?</HI></P>
<P>It is not instituted for the Dead, for they are in their Place where they forever will remain. It must likewise not be administred to those who are dying, for they are not in a Condition to re|ceive. Likewise not to Children, because they are not in a Condition to examine themselves. But it must be administred to the Living and Adult: But not to all that live corporally, for it is only instituted for the Regenerate who live spiritually, for it is a spiritual Food, which spiri|tual People can only receive for their strength|ning, it is a Sign and Seal of God's Covenant,
<PB N="135" REF="039964_0137_1015C8C0B6DFB2F0">
thus it follows of it self, those only who are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Covenant have a Right thereto, Christ hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> prepared this Meat <HI>for his Believers,</HI> faith t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Liturgy, as he only kept it with his Discipl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> who were sanctified. That this is the general O|pinion of the <HI>Reformed Church</HI> is evident, not only hence from the Instructer, but also from the Confession of Faith of the <HI>Reformed Church</HI> of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> which saith</P>
<P><Q><HI>We believe and confess that our Saviour Jesus Christ ordained and instituted the Sacrament of his holy Supper, to feed and maintain those who are already regenerated, and are ingrafted into his Houshould, the which is his Church, &amp;c.</HI></Q> Art. 35.</P>
<P>And because none but those should approach, the Instructer giveth a few Marks for the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">al of those who have a Right to come to the Lord's Table, and who they be that must keep them|selves from it.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Those who by reason of their Sins loath themselves,</HI> saith the Instructer. Those who are convinced, and have a sensible Knowledge of their manifold Sins, great Guilt, sinful miserable damnable Condition, and are with Grief, Sorrow and Shame, yea, even with Condemnation and Abhorrence become concerned about it, and thus to repent of their Wickedness, saying, <HI>What have I done? Jer.</HI> viii 6. We see this in <HI>Eph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|im, Jer.</HI> xxxi 19. This Dislike is that Regret through which a believing Sinner becometh sensi|bly
<PB N="136" REF="039964_0138_1015C8FFE517ED08">
humbled for his Sins, and bitterly lamenteth the same, from a Love to God and a hate to Sin. For such the Lord's Supper is instituted, for such are in the Covenant, and from the Covenant of Grace is unto them given, that they Remember their own evil Ways and Actions, that were not good, and thus to loath themselves in their own Sight for their Iniquities and Abominations, ac|cording to the Promise of the LORD, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxvi 31. Yea those are his fitted Objects of that Grace which is here Sealed, for the <HI>Poor in Spirit</HI> and those that <HI>mourn</HI> are called <HI>blessed, Matt.</HI> v. The Lord promiseth in his Favour <HI>to look at such, Is.</HI> lvii 15, 18 <HI>&amp;</HI> lxvi 2.</P>
<P N="2">2 This Dislike is in its self not enough, for <HI>Gain, Esau, Saul, Ahab,</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> where likewise convicted and repented, here must also be a Trusting or Depending <HI>that Sins are through Christ forgiven,</HI> and also <HI>that the re|maining, Debilities are covered with his Suffer|ings and Death.</HI></P>
<P>This Trusting, or Depending is no vain Pre|sumption, nor a stiff Imagination through which one imagineth that Christ is his Saviour but it is a refuge-taking Confidence of Faith, where by a believing Soul hath a liking in the Council of God through Jesus Christ the Surety, to reconcile and save Sinners, and with the highest Content, praises and approves of that Way, as good, wise and holy, wishing through that Way onely and no other to be

sanctified and saved, and on this to turn him|self to that Surety and Mediator out of a pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ful Sight and Sense of his Sins, wishing onely to be found in him, with a restless Desire to place all his Salvation in him, because he wants him in all Things and cannot endure without him, and also that he desire nothing beside him, because in him he sees a sufficient Fullness to satisfie all his Wants and Needs, upon this the Soul goes with an active Desire out to him, choosing him for its Portion, and thus cometh with him in a Treaty, and thus gives her self wholly and unlimitted over unto him, and ac|cepteth of him on his own free invitation as he is tendred, and intrusteth his Soul and Salvation in his Hands, and thus resteth in him with all his Heart, and thus <HI>receiveth God's Testimony, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> seals-that he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> Joh. iii 33. those now have a Right to the Lords Supper, for <HI>Hungry and Thirsty</HI> are invited, and are promised <HI>to be satisfied,</HI> Is. lv. 1. Matt. v, 6. <HI>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting Life,</HI> Joh. iii 36. To wit. here in Grace, which is the spiritual Life, a Beginning of eternal Life.</P>
<P>Those <HI>are more and more desirous to streng|then their Faith,</HI> saith the Instructer; for in|deed, to be desirous after Growth is the Nature of those who live spiritually, the Cry of the weak Believers is, <HI>Lord I believe help thou mine Un|belief,</HI> Mark. ix 24. <HI>increase our Faith,</HI> Luk. xvii 5. from hence it is manifest that this Food
<PB N="138" REF="039964_0140_1015C90542B089A0">
is also for the weak Believer, for the Instructor requireth not the highest Degree of Faith, or full Confidence: But yet, he that hath the sure Confidence of Faith that all his Sins are through Christ pardoned, is fit to receive the Lord's Supper with more Fruit, because, he as one that hath Right thereto and dare approach with Boldness and <HI>discern the Lords Body,</HI> and ac|cept of the Signs as a Seal of the Forgivness of Sins.</P>
<P N="3">3 And that it might appear that this Trusting or Depending is no vain Conceit therefore the Catechism likewise requireth <HI>a Desire to an A|mendment of Life.</HI> The Believers then taking Notice of themselves constantly see their Stray|ings with Grief and Displeasure, and hate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heartily and strive against it, therefore their Souls are very desirous to amend their Lives, yea, even to attain to Perfection, for although they know that in this Life they cannot attain to Perfection, yet they know that they can be more perfect than they are, therefore with <HI>Paul they follow after Perfection, and press toward the Mark, if that they may apprehend it,</HI> Phil. iii. 12, 13. The earnest Desire after Sancti|fication is needful if we approach to the Lord's Table, for all Things there are holy, and through the Use of this Covenant Seal, we not onely declare <HI>that the Lord is our God,</HI> but also <HI>that we are his People to keep all his Commandments.</HI> Deut. xxvi. 17. The Sacraments are likewise

Now from hence flows of its self, that those who do not possess these Things have no Right thereto, as the Instructer farther sheweth for whom the Lord's Supper is not instituted.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> Dissemblers, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who shew themselves better as indeed they be, ha|ving a Form of Godliness by Confession and external unreproveable Conversation and thus seem to be something by what they pretend to, and by their Gestures, Looks and Sighs deceive People, that they should suppose they where Pious; therefore they seek to behave themselves both in Words and Deeds as their Teachers would fain have it, and in the mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they are not like themselves at all Places, and at all Times, but then thus, and then so, the which can be discerned in their Conversation;

for the most are yet so blunt that when they are examined it may easily be discerned that they know not the Power of Godliness, much less possess it: But all that they aim at, is, to have the Name of a good Christian: These may not approach, because their Heart is not right, and because they do not possess any true Grace, but are yet Enemies and Haters of God, as Christ hath so often denounced a <HI>Wo</HI> unto such dis|cemblers. These are not only those who must not approach.</P>
<P N="2">2 But also <HI>all those who do not with a true Heart turn to God,</HI> saith the Instructer. He saith, <HI>that the Unconverted have no Right thereto.</HI> And if it he asked, who are unconverted? I answer all natural People, who are yet Strangers to the Life of God, as</P>
<P N="1">(1) All Ignorant, who have no Knowledge of the Fundamental Truths of the Work of Christ's Mediators Office, that have no Knowledge of the Nature of Regeneration, of the Nature of Faith, and know not how they through Faith should be ingrafted into Christ, that have no Knowledge of God's Righteousness and the Sinners Damna|bleness; those who do not understand the Nature of the Lord's Supper, and do not know to unite the Sign with the Thing signified, and know it not as a Seal.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Those who are not sensibly humbled by Reason of their Sins, but are unconcerned about
<PB N="141" REF="039964_0143_1015C929F890D1D8">
the State of their Souls, live at ease, and are carelese.</P>
<P N="3">(3) Those who have no Exercise and Deeds of Faith, and are not active in Christ, choosing him for their Surety, to long after him, and seek out after him with Prayers and Suplications, to ac|cept of him for Justification, and Sanctification, to give themselves over unto him, to live in U|nion with him.</P>
<P N="4">(4) Those who are earthly minded, whose De|sire, Longing, Seeking, Care, Love, Content, and Fear is in earthly Things, in <HI>Lust of the Eyes, Lust of the Flesh, and Pride of Life.</HI> In a Word.</P>
<P N="5">(5) Unconverted are such who willfully and wittingly without any Strife retain some Sins, and content themselves with a moral, civil and external Worship, but have never felt their for|lorn State without Christ, not being sanctified and internally changed to live a holy Life, from a Union with Christ, with Selfdenyal. Those are Unconverted. The <HI>Reformed Church</HI> judgeth of such according to God's Word, that they may not approach: For this is evident from powerful Reasons.</P>
<P><HI>(a)</HI> A stranger, an Uncircumcised and Unclean might not eat of the Passeover. So likewise now, the Unconverted, who are uncircumcised of Heart and not washed through the Blood of Christ, and not sanctified through the Spirit, but are sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|lying

<P><HI>(b)</HI> For unto an unconverted Person there is not one only Promise made, therefore nothing unto him sealed.</P>
<P><HI>(c)</HI> An unconverted Person has not the Spirit of Christ, and therefore doth not belong unto him, and for that Reason cannot be Sealed thro' the Spirit of his Partnership with Jesus and his Virtues, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii 9.</P>
<P><HI>(d)</HI> The Unconverted are void of spiritual Life, are Dead in Sins and Trespasses, now those who are thus spiritually dead, cannot eat spiri|tually.</P>
<P><HI>(e)</HI> The Unconverted have no Faith, which is notwithstanding the Mouth of the Soul, and there|fore they cannot with any essential Fruit of the Soul eat of that Bread which is only prepared for the Believers.</P>
<P><HI>(f)</HI> The Unconverted are Servants of Sin, Members and Slaves of Satan, now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would be dreadful that the Unholy should be the Mem|bers of Christ who is so holy, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 14,15. But if they notwithstanding approach (the which alas! they do) they must know, <HI>that they eat Damnation to themselves,</HI> as the Instructer saith from the Mouth of <HI>Paul.</HI> 1 Cor xi. 29. They agravate their Damnation, for Judgment is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or Punishment, in regard to the Hypo|crites and Unconverted, who eat to their Dam|nation: And no wonder, for using the Lord's
<PB N="143" REF="039964_0145_1015C92B86DAB320">
Supper unworthily, <HI>they make themselves guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</HI> as <HI>Paul,</HI> saith, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 27. They mock Christ and cru|cifie him a fresh, with the <HI>Jews,</HI> Heb. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i. 6. they defile this Sacrament the which is a Sign of the Body and Blood of Christ, and make themselves guilty of great Sins against Christ and also of Punishment, temporal and eternal: There|fore such are not much better than <HI>Judas,</HI> who be|trayed Christ, and as the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> who crucified him, and shed his blood. <HI>He that receives this Sacrament unworthily</HI> (saith <HI>The|ophylactus) he is as guilty as if he had himself killed the LORD, and had himself shed Christ's Blood.</HI> O abominable wickedness!</P>
<P>But one might think, if Hypocrites and Un|converted may not partake of the Lord's Sup|per, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hy then was <HI>Judas</HI> permitted? But although we should allow that <HI>Judas</HI> did re|ceive the Lord's Supper, foom thence neverthe|less does not follow that he had any Right thereto, as we have now sufficiently proved: But we hold it with the Chiefest Divines that <HI>Judas</HI> did partake of the Passover, but not of the Lord's Supper; this we can see from the Relation of <HI>John,</HI> in his Gospel, <HI>Chapt.</HI> viii. 26, 27, 30. who plainly saith, <HI>that as soon as Judas was discovered, and had received the paschal Sop, and the Devil being entered into him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he immediately went out,</HI> v. 30. <HI>He then haven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> received the Sop, went out immediately,</HI> this hap|pned before Supper.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="039964_0146_1015C90F575BB4B0">
Christ would have spoken a lie if he had given <HI>Judas</HI> the Supper, saying, <HI>This is my Body, which is broken for YOU; this is my Blood which is shed for YOU;</HI> Which must not so much as be thought of the Mouth of Truth.</P>
<P>Therefore it remains sure, that not onely Un|converted may not approach, but also the Over|seers of the Church must resist and debarr such from opproaching.</P>

<P>THerefore the Instructor asketh, <HI>Quest.</HI> 82. <HI>Must those be admitted to this supper who by their Confession, and Life behave themselves as unbelieving and ungodly People?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> No, all those who by their Confession and Conversation behave themselves as Unbe|lieving and Ungodly must be kept off, and these are who err in the Truths of Faith, and have thereof Misapprehensions; all the Igno|rant who have no true Knowledge of themselves, nor of Christ, nor of the Contents of the Lord's Supper for such are Unbelievers, for there can be no Faith without Knowledge, <HI>Rom.</HI> x 14.

Sins,</HI> whereof the Liturgy hath a Register <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> For if those were admitted, <HI>God's Covenant would be prophaned,</HI> saith the Instructer, because we then prophane the Seals of God's Covenant, and thus the Covenant it self. Yea, then <HI>God's Wrath is kindled against the whole Congregation,</HI> saith the Instructer, who is wroth that his Covenant is prophaned, and punisheth it on those who not onely do the same but also on those who do not keep them off: <HI>But unto the Wicked God saith what hast thou to declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldest take my Covenant in thy Mouth,</HI> Ps. l. 16. Thus it went with the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> they acted very slovenly with the Lord's Supper when a|mongst them <HI>many where punished with Weakness Sickness and Death,</HI> I Cor xi 34.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>SE there Hearers; this is the Doctrine of the <HI>Reformed Church</HI> concerning those who have Right to the Lords Supper, and those who
<PB N="146" REF="039964_0148_1015C911CB022D20">
have no Right thereunto; and the Offencive and Ingodly must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">barr'd and kept off by the Overseers of the Church.</P>
<P>This also hath always been the Practice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hose who sought to be Faithful in their Duty concerning the pure administration of the Lord's Supper.</P>
<P>The Ancients have been very carefull and cautious in admitting any to the Holy Sup|per.</P>
<P>From hence that man of God, Calvin, gave a clear demonstration when he saith <Q>Here we must also have regard to the Lord's Supper, that it be not defiled hy giving it in general without exception; for it's very sure and cer|tain that he who must administer the same, if he by his Knowledge admits any who are un|worthy, the which with Right he might have kept back, is guilty of as great a Sacriledge as if he had cast the Body of the Lord to the Dogs. Therefore <HI>Chrysostom</HI> expostulates very strenuously with the Priests for fearing the Power of great Men, not daring to debarr any from approaching. The Blood (saith he) shall be required at your Hands; if thou fearest Man, he will mock thee; But if thou fearest God, Men will likewise respect aud regard thee. Let us not fear Scepters nor purple Cloathing, nor Kingly Crowns, we have here a greater Power, I would rather give my Body over to Death and have my Blood shed than to

Many are admitted who have no fun|damental Knowledge of the Truth which is according to Godliness, yea, without having a true Comprehension why the Lords Supper was instituted, and what a Christian hath there to perform, and what Matter those outward Ele|ments signify and Seal: and when it goes yet at the best, the new coming Members are in some Degree examined, concerning the Ground<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Knowledge and Truth, and farther, if their Conversation is inoffensive, but concerning tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Repentence, Faith and Conversion is scarce in|quired into by many, not to mention that where these things, (at least probably) are not found should not be admitted to receive this holy Food and Drink, which Christ hath onely prepared for his Believers, to speak with the Words of the accustomed Liturgy.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="039964_0152_1015C9186147F560">
If the <HI>reformed Church</HI> learneth that none that are Unconverted may approach, but that the Ungodly must be kept off; what is then the Reason that this Sacrament is so lightly gi|ven to those who do but desire it, and have the Name of Members, although they are often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ignorant as the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and visibly live in notorious Sins, and shew not the least modesty. <HI>O good God to what evil times hast thou spared me!</HI> May be cryed out with the holy <HI>Policar|pus:</HI> For it is now come to that pass that we find many People that bare the Name of Refor|med, and yet not understand that Doctrine, but speak against it, and accuse it, and in Practice deny it. I have administred the Holy Supper twice (now four times) and insisted upon this Truth, that no Unconverted may approach, and that the Ungodly must be debarr'd according to our Doctrine: But what murmurings has there not been about it? How many Tongues set on fire of Hell have slandered this, yea <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ven those whom it in the least did not become. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would ask those who have for this been so Dissatisfied, and perhaps are yet, whether this is not the Doctrine of the <HI>Reformed Church?</HI> I cannot think that any one will deny it; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he that is not wilfully blind hath heard this sufficiently. But why then are you disobedient unto the Truth?

not the spirit of God by the mouth of <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. xi 29. <HI>He that eateth and drinketh un|worthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to him|self,</HI> can there be a severer Punishment threat|ned? Doth not our Catechism say <HI>that if any ungodly be admitted that then God's Covenant is prophaned and the Wrath of God kindled against the whole Congregation?</HI> Can there be any Thing spoken more severe? Indeed thou must needs accuse thy self, and if thy Conscience was not past feeling, but did you once see and know what you have done, you would needs be terrified and fear the Wrath of God. But I will insist no longer hereon. And what con|cerneth my own Person, I care but little what unreasonable and natural People prattle of be|hind my Back, who would fain be dealt with according to their own perverse Conceptions but not according to the Truth of God's Word They miserably deceive themselves who think to cause me to be silent, I rather wish to die a thousand Deaths as not to preach the Truth.</P>
<P>Well beloved Hearers, those of you who have so often been at the Lord's Supper, do you know that no one that is unconverted may approach Have you then deligently examined your selves if you were Regenerated? Have had an under standing Knowledge of these Things which were thereto required when you approached so con|tented and well satisfied? Or did you be|come

so blindfold to the same, not onely with|out a Wedding Carment, but not so much as being troubled concerning it, not trying your selves whether you were of those who are invi|ted? Say you, <HI>I did not know that there was so much required thereto.</HI> But this you ought to have known, you ought at least to have under|stood your Catechism. Is it so dangerous to re|ceive the blessed Supper unworthily, for we sin dreadfully and incurr a terrible Judgment on our selves; how then is it possible that Satan can thus blind Men, so that they esteem this so light, and so little fear God's Judgments and so lightly snatch at a Food which instead of eternal Life might seal unto them eternal Per|dition? How is it possible to be so inconsiderate and prophane in such a great Matter?</P>
<P>Hearers be no longer ignorant concerning this Truth, lay this to Heart: For if there be any Thing in the World, wherein we ought to act cautiously, it is here; let us then be cautious herein. <HI>He that loveth Danger is worthy to come into it,</HI> but no Danger greater than here. Here with one Morsel and with one Sup we can pro|phane <HI>God's Covenant, and bring his Wrath over the whole Congregation,</HI> and make our selves guilty of temporal and eternal Punishment. Therefore call to mind this Truth and remember it, and know that although you may be civil and outwardly religious, and yet not born again, bare of spiritual Life, that you have no Right to

<P>Although the Knowledge of a Persons Rege|neration is not the Ground whereon a Teacher can and may allow one to approach, as the <HI>Labadists</HI> do err; yet it is notwithstanding the Duty of a Teacher to examine the Members, according to <HI>Prov.</HI> xxv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> 23. <HI>Ezec.</HI> xliv 33.

This Duty is very well described by the fa|mous <HI>D'Outrein,</HI> in his Treatise before-mention|ed, <HI>pag.</HI> 109. <Q><HI>The Teachers who are especially intrusted to admit of Members, must not only take care, that those whom they shall receive be by them already well taught in the Principles of the Christian Dactrine; or if they be taught by others, to sound or touch them concerning the Ability which they have in making a Confession of the Truth; but they must also examine the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> if then are truly penitent, and have an upright saving Faith, and a heart-changing Conversion: The Necessity of these Things the Teacher must earnestly press on their Hearts; he must exa|mine them if those Things be with them, and warn them not to deceive themselves: For when he without an Examination hereof, and a faith|ful Warning, allow any one Admittance, and so induceth him to eat and drink Damnation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> himself; how is that to be apprehended, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that the Guilt thereof in some Degree should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> come to the Charge of those who do not punctu|ally examine such, at least having not earn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> warned him, according to Ezec.</HI> xxxiii 7, 8.</Q></P>
<P>If then an Overseer in good Conscience shall receive or admit of any, he must have regard whether that Partaker gives a good Confession of the Truth, of his Sins, of his Faith in Christ, and of his Design to Holiness and Amendment of his Life; and if his Conversation doth not contradict his Confession; this is also required
