<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following Letters the reader will not meet with a day relation of events merely military. The Author, avoiding the naked brevity and minute preci&s;ion of a camp Journal, occa&s;ionally adverts to the natural hi&s;tory, and politics of America, as well as to the religion, national character, and cu&s;toms of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Some pains ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e been taken, in this tran&s;lation, to retain, if po&s;&s;ible, the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and philo&s;ophical manner of the French original, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n deviates from the common line of &s;im|ple narration, and introduces &s;entiment as well as de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Author appears to be a philo&s;opher, and though many of his ideas on religion, politics, genius of the people &amp;c. may be di&s;&s;onant from our mode of thinking on the&s;e points, in America, and &s;ometimes perhaps really ill founded, yet there is certainly more &s;atisfaction in di&s;covering what opinion a foreigner entertains of us, although only from a ca&s;ual acquaintance, a tran&s;ient vi&s;it to the country, than in reading the be&s;t accounts and narratives of our own, which, in &s;uch matters, may be &s;u&s;pected of being too ready to humour our local prejudices, or flatter our vanity.</P>
<P>They who would &s;aunter over half the Globe to copy the in&s;cription on an antique column, to mea&s;ure the altitude of a pyramid, or de&s;cribe the ornaments on the Grand Seignior's State Turban, will &s;carcely find any thing in American Tra|vels to gratify their t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">te. The works of art are here compa|ratively trivial and incon&s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rable, the &s;plendor of pageantry rather ob&s;cure and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">tly few or none but the admi|rers of &s;imple Nature can either travel with plea&s;ure them&s;elves
<PB REF="018167_0004_0FA55EB5B9274578">
or read the travels of others with &s;atisfaction, through this country.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e accounts of North-America, given to the public by Briti&s;h explorators and others, previous to the Revolution, are generally taken up, with the recital of wonder|ful adventures, in the woods beyond the Lakes, or with the Hi&s;tories and records of the wild Indian nations, &s;o that by the time the reader gets through one of tho&s;e performances he never fails to be better acquainted with the <HI>Ottagamies, Cherokees, Miamees, Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouwe&s;&s;ians,</HI> and a hundred others, with their various cu&s;toms of <HI>paw-wawing,</HI> or methods of making <HI>wampum,</HI> than with the mo&s;t intere&s;ting particulars relative to the <HI>inhabitants</HI> of the <HI>then</HI> colonies; <HI>the&s;e</HI> were but rarely thought worth mentioning by tho&s;e gentlemen, and when they are, it is mortifying enough to &s;ee them con&s;tantly con&s;idered rather as mere bea&s;ts of burden, calculated &s;olely for the &s;upport of the grandeur, wealth and omnipotence of Great Britain, than as men and Free-Men.</P>
<P>Our French Author is more liberal&mdash;two years before the pre&s;ent peace he con&s;idered the United-States as a great inde|pendent nation, advancing with ha&s;ty &s;trides to the &s;ummit of power and &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>Conci&s;e, yet curious accounts of two of the greate&s;t events that have happened in this or any other age, will be found in the following performance: the&s;e cannot fail of attracting &s;ome &s;hare of the reader's attention, not only becau&s;e they were the vi&s;ible means of accelerating an independence, which, according to probability, and in the natural cour&s;e of human affairs, was the ta&s;k of another century, but al&s;o be|cau&s;e the philo&s;ophers both of America and of Europe, in con&s;equence of the pacification thereby effected, have their ideas upon the &s;tretch, carefully anticipating the commercial, and political advantages, or di&s;advantages, re&s;ulting from this very extraordinary Revolution.</P>

<P>I HAVE at length, my dear friend, accompli&s;hed my long Voyage over the va&s;t Atlantic. For the &s;pace of no le&s;s than eighty five days we were to&s;&s;ed about in our floating habitation, but in the word of our danger, and when we were &s;eemingly upon the point of being overtur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by the fury of the winds and waves, I had the &s;atisfaction to find that our &s;hip con&s;tantly returned to her original po&s;ition by that univer&s;al all-pervading principle, the central attraction of gravity. How many efforts, how much time mu&s;t it have taken to have perfected the&s;e huge and unwieldy machi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, by the aid of which man are enabled to de&s;pi&s;e the utmo&s;t fury and mo&s;t violent agitations of the waves! Like new <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lu&s;es</HI> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y curb the impetuo&s;ity of the winds, or by the power of reaction f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m to contribute to the progre&s;s of the voyage, in almo&s;t opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e directions.</P>
<P>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">las! this noble art has not yet been able to &s;ecure the voyager from that di&s;agreeable malady called <HI>&s;ea &s;ickne&s;s,</HI> occa&s;ion|ed by the motion of the ve&s;&s;el. I believe I have &s;uffered as much from this nau&s;eous complaint as any per&s;on that ever went to &s;ea, and notwith&s;tanding the frequent u&s;e of acids, it for a long time
<PB N="10" REF="018167_0010_0FA55EBA2EE5FB40">
wholly prevented me from attending to any kind of bu&s;ine&s;s, or paying a particular attention to the many objects that &s;urrounded me. Langui&s;hing with weakne&s;s, and confined to the narrow bounds of this floating pri&s;on, hearing nothing from morning till night but the barbarous phra&s;es peculiar to the &s;ea and &s;ailors, I was in no condition to ob&s;erve or reflect upon the awful beauties of the ocean, or the grandeur of the &s;cene around me. With per|fect indifference I beheld it to&s;&s;ing, boiling and foaming; &s;welling into mountains, or jumbled into a chaos of confu&s;ion; its vapour exhaling into the air, or forming artificial rainbows about our ve&s;&s;el, while it at the &s;ame time menaced us with de&s;truction. With little or no emotion, I &s;aw it abate of its rage, grow &s;mooth, extend the limits of the horizon, and pre&s;ently re&s;emble an immen&s;e ma&s;s of oil, &s;till however retaining its undulation. But it was difficult for me to withhold my attention from tho&s;e &s;cintillations of light, which the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable motion in the water &s;truck out of ob&s;curity; they were particularly remarkable when a fre&s;h g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e drove the ve&s;&s;el through the water with an increa&s;ed rapidity; &s;he then &s;eemed to plunge into torrents of flaming pho&s;phorus, and to be making a tremendous progre&s;s through plains of liquid fire. I revolved in my own mind, what could be the cau&s;e of this &s;ingular, though common appearance, which I believe has never been thoroughly inve&s;tigated: Are they atoms of &s;alt which, from their &s;everal &s;urfaces, reflect the rays of light? Or is it their colli&s;ion with the &s;ulphurous particles, that kindles them into flame, or are they rather the igneous fluid, the radical fire that is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fir&s;t cau&s;e of fluidity in the other elements?</P>
<P>We &s;teered a &s;outherly cour&s;e till we came to the 30th. degree of North Latitude. The &s;ea in this climate appeared to me to have more of a greeni&s;h ca&s;t than before, and to abound throughout with this fire re&s;embling pho&s;phorus; we there &s;aw the goldfi&s;h, the voracious dolphin, and the flying fi&s;h, which to e&s;cape the former, flies out of the water, but falls down again as &s;oon as the air has dried the moi&s;ture on its wings. I did not know the galley fi&s;h, tho' common enough on our coa&s;ts; but the &s;ailors caught one, which I examined with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention. Nature has given it a bladder, which buoys it up and &s;erves as a rudder to direct its cour&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; its whole contexture is nothing more than a &s;limy ma&s;s, the organi&s;ation of which I had not time thoroughly to con&s;ider; it is provided with long fibres encircled with rings, which &s;erve to give it a hold in the water, &s;o as not to be driven away by the violence of the wind; and through the&s;e fibres they al&s;o &s;uck up the food that &s;erves for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I touched this animal with my finger, and immediately had the painful &s;en&s;ation of a burn, ard forty-eight hours afterwards I &s;till felt the effects of this penetrating cau&s;tic.</P>

wholly altered; the ecliptic circle had withdrawn it&s;elf a great di&s;tance from the Horizon, the pole-&s;tar had approached very near thereto, and the great Bear was about &s;etting and concealing him&s;elf entirely from our view: what &s;urpri&s;ed me mo&s;t, was, that the milky way had di&s;appeared, although I plainly perceived the con&s;tellation of the <HI>Swan</HI>&punc; which is known to have its place in the mid&s;t of it&mdash;I could wi&s;h the philo&s;ophers would explain this a&s;tronomical my&s;tery, tho&s;e e&s;pecially who argue that the <HI>Galaxy</HI> is nothing more than an immen&s;e collection of &s;tars; for why &s;hould the&s;e &s;tars di&s;appear, when all the re&s;t of the heavenly bodies are vi&s;ible here as well as in other places?&mdash;I now no longer wondered at the idea of the ancients about the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un in the ocean:</P>
<P>Being often forced for the &s;ake of fre&s;h air to be upon deck at the time of his appearing or di&s;appearing, I ob&s;erved him &s;ome|times detaching him&s;elf &s;lowly from the line that bounded the &s;kies and waters, and at other times falling perpendicularly into the mid&s;t of the waves; the eye, with a momentary deception, per&s;uading it&s;elf that the Horizon was plunging after the great luminary.&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;ea, you well know, has plants and herbage peculiar to it&s;elf; it is remarkable that nature has formed them con&s;iderably different from land vegetables in colour, &s;hape and properties; and if of a le&s;s delicate &s;tructure, it was doubtle&s;s ordered &s;o becau&s;e &s;he did not intend this element to produce animals as precious and &s;o exqui&s;itely wrought as the other. The marine plants, however, are not without evident traces of the wi&s;e hand that formed them; I often &s;aw the &s;ea covered with the&s;e &s;aline herbs for a great &s;pace, and in examining them, remarked among other things that in&s;tead of fibrous roots, they had parts &s;omewhat like hands to attach them&s;elves to the rocks, a &s;tem flatted at the end, and thick leaves, the better to re&s;i&s;t the &s;hock of the waves; and all provided at &s;mall intervals with cells nearly empty of air, which by this means counterpoi&s;ed their &s;pecific weight, and forced them to tend con|&s;tantly in a perpendicular direction toward the &s;urface of the water.</P>
<P>I cannot give you a competent idea of the agreeable emotions I experienced at the &s;ight of land, which at fir&s;t appeared like a thin mi&s;t at the very extremity of the Horizon. What moment of life is comparable to that when a man is upon the point of re-enjoying his health, coming within reach of objects which intere&s;t the mind, the heart and the &s;en&s;es, and finding, in&s;tead of a late chaos and the gha&s;tly image of de&s;truction, a world of nature everywhere organized into the mo&s;t elegant &s;ymmetry and perfection&mdash;to walk upon the gra&s;&s;y plain, to breathe the perfume of a thou&s;and flowers, to enjoy the &s;hade of the trees, to li&s;ten to the harmony of the birds of the grove, and to &s;ee them &s;oar aloft and poi&s;e them&s;elves in the air!</P>

The prin|cipal virtue of the Quakers ought to be <HI>patience</HI>: for their <HI>in&s;pired</HI> orators often put <HI>it</HI> to &s;evere proof, and the women, always atten|tive to the &s;ugge&s;tions and dictates of this divine &s;pirit, make, it is &s;aid, very free u&s;e of the precious gift of &s;peech.</P>
<P>Such an extraordinary manner of wor&s;hip, could not long retain its credit in the world, unle&s;s its followers manife&s;ted greater &s;im|plicity in their outward appearance, were more humane toward their fellow creatures, more upright in their dealings, and more di&s;intere&s;ted in civil &s;ociety, than other men.

<P>Such virtues as the above, in which the Quakers are &s;aid to ex|cel, have been more prevalent among them and of longer duration in America, than el&s;ewhere, becau&s;e the climate and the life they lead is favourable thereto.</P>
<P>Piety, is not the only motive that brings the American Ladies in crowds to the various places of wor&s;hip.

European method, of &s;etting off the head to the be&s;t advantage. They are of a large &s;ize, well proportioned, their features general|ly regular, and their complexion fair, without ruddine&s;s. They have le&s;s cheerfulne&s;s and ea&s;e of behaviour, than the ladies of France, but more of greatne&s;s and dignity; I have even imagined that I have &s;een &s;omething in them, that an&s;wers to the ideas of beauty we gain from tho&s;e ma&s;ter-pieces of the arti&s;ts of antiquity, which are yet extant in our days.

At twenty-five years of age, the women begin to lo&s;e the bloom and fre&s;hne&s;s of youth; and at thirty-five or forty, their beauty is gone.</P>
<P>The decay of the men is equally premature, and I am in|clined to think that life it&s;elf is here proportionably &s;hort. I vi|&s;ited all the burying grounds in Bo&s;ton, where it is u&s;ual to in&s;cribe upon the &s;tone over each grave, the names and ages of the decea&s;ed, and found that few who had arrived to a &s;tate of manhood, ever ad|va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ced beyond their fiftieth year; fewer &s;till to &s;eventy, and be|yond that &s;carcely any.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With the like attention, I examined all the church yards from Bo&s;ton to William&s;burg, almo&s;t three hundred leagues, and found nearly the &s;ame re&s;ult.</NOTE></P>
<P>Bo&s;ton is &s;ituated on a penin&s;ula, upon a de&s;cent towards the &s;ea &s;ide; this penin&s;ula is connected witn the continent only by a neck of land, which at full tide is not more than the breadth of a high way, &s;o that it would be no difficult matter to render this a place of great &s;trength. Hard by is an eminence which commands the whole town, upon which the Bo&s;tonians have built a kind of light-Hou&s;e or beacon, of a great height, with a barrel of tar fixed at the top, ready to &s;et fire to in ca&s;e of an attack. At &s;uch a &s;ig|nal, more than forty thou&s;and men would take arms, and be at the gates of the town in le&s;s than twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>From hence may be &s;een the ruins of Charle&s;town, which was burnt by the Engli&s;h, on the 17th of June, 1775, at the battle of Bunker's Hill&mdash;a melancholy pro&s;pect, calculated to keep up in the brea&s;ts of the Bo&s;tonians, the &s;pirit and &s;entiments of liberty.

<P>The commerce of the Bo&s;tonians formerly comprized a variety of articles, and was very exten&s;ive before the breaking out of the pre&s;ent war. They &s;upplied Great Britain with ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts and yards for her royal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avy, and built, either upon commi&s;&s;ion or their own account, a great number of merchantmen, remarkable for their &s;uperiority in &s;ailing.

<P>The product of this fi&s;hery was about fifty thou&s;and quintals, annually, which they exported to the other neighbouring pro|vinces, and even to Spain, Italy and throughout the Mediterr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nean, while tho&s;e of the wor&s;t quality were de&s;tined to the u&s;e of the negroes in the Caribbee I&s;lands.

di&s;po&s;ed of their &s;hips and cargoes together, and went over to England to purcha&s;e their manufactures, which they tran&s;ported to America in Engli&s;h Bottoms, and thus the mother country increa&s;ed, by the American commerce, the value of her own commodities, while &s;he &s;upplied them only with articles of con|&s;umption. By this double exchange with the Americans, the Engli&s;h manufactures were in great demand, although they could not be afforded &s;o cheap as tho&s;e of other nations, owing to the exce&s;&s;ive price of labour in England. Their fi&s;heries, their trade, and the va&s;t number of ve&s;&s;els they built has rendered them the car|riers of all the Northern colonies.</P>
<P>It is computed that from 1748 to 1749, inclu&s;ive, there were 500 ve&s;&s;els employed from this port in foreign commerce, and inward entries were made of 430; and the coa&s;ting and fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els amounted to at lea&s;t 1000. It appears however that after this, as a certain Engli&s;h author remarks, their commerce had declined.</P>
<P>In 1738 forty-one &s;hips were built at Bo&s;ton making in the whole 6380 tons; in 1743 were built 28; in 1746 twenty; in 1749 fifteen, amounting in all to 2450 tons. This decrea&s;e in the commerce of Bo&s;ton probably aro&s;e from &s;everal new e&s;tabli&s;h|ments that had been formed along the coa&s;t, which drew to them&s;elves tho&s;e different branches of trade which their &s;everal &s;ituations favoured them in.</P>
<P>The great demand for rum among the Americans led them to form connexions with the French Colonies: and our wines and brandies making this liquor of &s;mall reque&s;t among us, they flat|tered them&s;elves that they could import mola&s;&s;es to advan|tage. This attempt &s;ucceeded beyond their expectations, although they had nothing to give in exchange but lumber, and &s;ome &s;alt provi&s;ions. But the Engli&s;h government perceiving the injury its own i&s;lands thereby &s;uffered, prohibited this commerce entirely. The colonies, upon this, complained bitterly, and repre&s;ented, that by hindering them from exporting the productions of their &s;oil to what port they plea&s;ed, they would be rendered unable to pay for tho&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary articles, which they purcha&s;ed at an exorbitant price in England.</P>
<P>The government then took a middle way; permitted them the exportation of lumber, and loaded french &s;ugar and other foreign commodities imported, with very heavy duties. But this did not yet &s;atisfy the colonies: they con&s;idered the mother country in the light of a jealous and avaricious &s;tep-mother, watching every opportunity to turn to her own advantage tho&s;e channels of gain, which would have enabled them to live in ea&s;e and plenty. This was one of the principal cau&s;es of the mi&s;under&s;tanding between England and her colonies; from thenceforward the latter perceived what a change independence would make in their favour, and France was by no means ignorant of the political advantages that would accrue to her from &s;uch a revolution.</P>

<P>The Europeans have long been convinced of the natural and moral dangers to be apprehended, in acquiring education in large towns. The Bo&s;tonians have advanced farther, they have pre|vented the&s;e dangers. Their Univer&s;ity is at Cambridge, &s;even miles from Bo&s;ton, on the banks of Charles River, in a beautiful and healthy &s;ituation. There are four colleges, all of brick, and of a regular form. The Engli&s;h troops made u&s;e of them as barracks in 1775, and forced the profe&s;&s;ors and &s;tudents to turn out.

To give you an idea of the merit of the &s;everal profe&s;&s;ors it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that they corre&s;pond with the literati of Europe, and that <HI>Mr. Sewall,</HI> in particular, profe&s;&s;or of the Oriental languages, is one of tho&s;e to whom the author of genius and ability has been lavi&s;h of tho&s;e gifts; their pupils often act tragedies, the &s;ubject of which is generally taken from their national events, &s;uch as the battle of Bunkers-Hill, the burning of Charle&s;town, the Death of General Montgomery, the capture of Burgoyne, the trea&s;on of Arnold, and the Fall of Briti&s;h Tyranny. You will ea&s;ily conclude, that in &s;uch a new nation as this, the&s;e pieces mu&s;t fall infinitely &s;hort of that perfection to which our European literary productions of this kind are wrought up; but &s;till, they have a greater effect upon the mind than the be&s;t of ours would have among them, becau&s;e tho&s;e manners and cu&s;toms are delineated, which are peculiar to them&s;elves, and the events are &s;uch as intere&s;t them above all others: The drama is here reduced to its true and ancient origin. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We confine our theatrical pieces either to fabulous heroes, the characters and manners of which have little or no re&s;emblance to ours, and who&s;e actions we can take no part in, or el&s;e draw our pictures of life from that cla&s;s in &s;ociety which are the lea&s;t numerous, I mean the great and rich. The multitude can take no intere&s;t, can apply nothing to them&s;elves in the&s;e performances, and mu&s;t derive all their entertainment from &s;ome adventitious beauties, &s;uch as the connexion of the plan, the choice of the &s;ituations, the harmony of the ver&s;e &amp;c. The Greeks, whom we have badly imitated, were in the&s;e points much more rational; all their dramatical &s;ubjects had a reference to their own mythology, form of wor&s;hip, government, and the manners and cu&s;toms of the &s;everal States; hence, their theatrical pieces could be &s;upported without love fictions, or an ab&s;urd mixture of incidents. Much has been &s;aid about depravity of ta&s;te, perver&s;ion of manners, and &s;o on, when the Pari&s;ians have been found to for&s;ake the great theatres, and run to foreign exhibitions. But people deceive them&s;elves in this matter; tho&s;e who flocked thither, with the greate&s;t eagerne&s;s, were people mo&s;t engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;equently le&s;s corrupted in their manners than the great.

<P><PB N="19" REF="018167_0019_0FA55EC6ECE7DD68">It is difficult to imagine what a &s;trange idea the Americans had of the inhabitants of France, prior to the war; they looked upon them as a people bowed down beneath the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m, given up to &s;uper&s;tition, &s;lavery, and prejudice, mere idolaters in their public wor&s;hip, and, in &s;hort, a kind of light, nimble machines, deformed to the la&s;t degree, incapable of any thing &s;olid or con&s;i&s;t|ent; entirely taken up with the dre&s;&s;ing of their hair, and paint|ing their faces; without delicacy or fidelity, and paying no re&s;pect even to the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations.&mdash;The Engli&s;h, it &s;eems, were plea&s;ed to di&s;&s;eminate the&s;e prejudices among&s;t them, and confirm them therein; Pre&s;byteriani&s;m, a mo&s;t bitter enemy to the Catho|lic Faith, had likewi&s;e rendered the Bo&s;tonians, among whom this &s;ect is predominant, more ready to li&s;ten to and believe them.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the war, every thing &s;eemed to concur to &s;trengthen the&s;e prejudices. The greater part of the French, who came into America at the fir&s;t appearance of the revolution, were men loaded with debts, and ruined at home in their reputation; and yet, by a&s;&s;uming titles and fictitious names, they obtained di&s;tingui&s;hing ranks in the American army, received advances of money to a con&s;iderable amount, and then immediately di&s;ap|peared. The &s;implicity of the Americans, added to their little ex|perience, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dered the&s;e villanies le&s;s liable to be detected. Ma|ny of the&s;e adventurers even committed crimes in America, wor|thy of the mo&s;t rigorous puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t commodities, too, that the Bo&s;tonians received from France, contributed, by their bad quality, to &s;ugge&s;t unfavoura|ble ideas re&s;pecting our upright dealing, and indu&s;try. For this rea&s;on, only, tho&s;e goods which were imported hither from France,

are &s;old at a con&s;iderably lower price than Engli&s;h articles, not in any re&s;pect &s;uperior.</P>
<P>At the arrival of the Count D'E&s;taing, the people here were much &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the French were not &s;uch weak, diminutive and deformed little mortals, as their prejudices had painted them: They however at la&s;t concluded, that the Count and the people in his fleet, had been picked out on purpo&s;e, in or|der to give them a more advantageous idea of the nation. Some coloured figures, having accidentally &s;tained one of the dre&s;&s;ing cloths, confirmed them in the opinion, that the French made u&s;e of vermillion to colour their faces.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding my being known for a Frenchman, and Roman Prie&s;t, I was continually receiving new civilities from &s;everal of the be&s;t families in this town; but the people in general retain their old prejudices: I &s;aw a remarkable proof of it one day from a trifling occurrence, which at the &s;ame time &s;erved to give me a better idea of their character. The chimney of the hou&s;e I lodged in, and which belonged to a Frenchman, happened to take fire; you may ea&s;ily conceive what an uproar this would occa&s;ion in a town chiefly con&s;tructed of wood. The people collected in crowds; but after they were told who&s;e hou&s;e it was, they remained idle &s;pectators of the &s;cene. I then cau&s;ed the doors to be &s;hut to &s;top the draft of air, and clo&s;ed up the chimney, in which the fire was, with a wet blanket; we al&s;o threw water down ince&s;&s;antly, to ge|nerate a moi&s;ture; the women of the hou&s;e, who were Americans, were however, much di&s;plea&s;ed at the &s;ight of the floors, covered with water and foot; and if we had not, in de&s;pight of them, acted as we thought fit, I think they would rather have had the hou&s;e burnt, than the floors and ceilings &s;poiled.</P>
<P>We have ju&s;t heard the news of the capture of St. Eu&s;tatius by the Engli&s;h: without doubt, avarice had a greater &s;hare in ad|vi&s;ing this expedition, than &s;ound policy. The Americans, not plea&s;ed with &s;uch of the French manufactures as were fir&s;t &s;ent over, went thither to purcha&s;e tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h, which after the war with Holland, were &s;ent out to that i&s;land under neutral flags; and thus they ruined one of their principal branches of commerce, and forced the Americans to have recour&s;e to our productions, which experience has now taught them to have a more favourable opinion of than before.</P>
<P>The arrival of the army, under M. le Comte de Rochambeau, at Rhode-I&s;land, &s;pread a general terror through that place: the fields became mere de&s;erts, and tho&s;e whom curio&s;ity led to vi&s;it Newport <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the capital town of the State; the goodne&s;s of its &s;oil and the excellence of its climate have gained it the name of the <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> of New-England: its trade was very flouri&s;hing before the war: Be&s;ides its lumber and &s;alt provi&s;ions, which were exported to the I&s;lands, they &s;ent out large quantities of beer, chee&s;e, poultry and tallow.</NOTE> could &s;carcely perceive a hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n form in the &s;treet.

Every Frenchman &s;aw the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there was for obliterat|ing the&s;e prejudices, and every one &s;acrificed &s;omething to his own feelings, in order to accompli&s;h this de&s;ired end. The &s;uperior officers e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;cipline among the troops: and the officers in general manife&s;ted upon every occa&s;ion that politene&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of behaviour peculiar to the nobility and gentry of France: In con&s;equence of this the &s;oldiery became mild, circum|&s;pect and moderate, and for a whole year there was not a &s;ingle complaint made.</P>
<P>The French at Newport were no longer that fickle, pre&s;umptuous, blu&s;tering, haughty people that prejudice had pictured them; at the entertainments they gave, their whole behaviour was quiet and re&s;erved, and their conver&s;ation confined to the American gue&s;ts, to whom they became every day more and more dear. The&s;e young French noblemen, whom fortune, birth, and the habit of a court life, commonly leads to di&s;&s;ipation, luxury and a love of empty pomp, were the fir&s;t to &s;et the example of a &s;imple and frugal manner of living; and they now &s;howed them&s;elves as affable and as courteous to all, as if they had lived their whole lives with the&s;e citizens, in the quality of equals. This conduct, &s;trictly per&s;evered in, brought about a total change in the opinions of the Americans, regarding us. Even the Tories <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tories <HI>i. e.</HI> Royali&s;ts. This word is derived from the Saxon.</NOTE> could not but re&s;pect the French, altho' they dete&s;ted the cau&s;e they &s;upported, and I am informed they were infinitely more affected with &s;orrow at the departure of the army, than they had been alarmed with fear at their arrival.</P>
<P>The French have in general, been upbraided a long time for paying no regard to the mo&s;t &s;acred of all connexions, when their gallantry is concerned. Perhaps Newport may have afforded &s;ome examples. A French officer, by his attention and a&s;&s;iduity, gained the affections of a young and amiable lady. Her hu&s;band, who loved her tenderly, was &s;oon convinced of the reality of this new attachment, and altho' afflicted in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner, he did not di&s;cover his trouble to her either by complaints or reproaches; the reputation of his guilty &s;pou&s;e was &s;till dear to him, and he was even afraid &s;he would di&s;cover that he had knowledge of her infidelity. "And yet if &s;he continues doubtful of it (&s;aid he to a friend) &s;he will give over all hopes of regaining my e&s;teem; her ruin will of con&s;equence en&s;ue, and my own peace be &s;acrificed: let us then endeavour to awaken her tenderne&s;s, and recall her to her duty by remor&s;e for what is pa&s;t." From this moment he became more a&s;&s;iduous and complai&s;ant to her than ever; with &s;orrow and de&s;pair in his &s;oul, he &s;howed a countenance &s;erene and &s;atisfied. He received at his hou&s;e, with attention and civility, the very officer who was the author of his misfortune; but, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend, &s;o contrived matters, as to hinder him from
<PB N="22" REF="018167_0022_0FA55EC9320E77E8">
any private interviews with her whatever. The&s;e repeated di&s;ap|pointments appeared to the Frenchman to be mere effects of chance; he, however, grew fallen and peevi&s;h upon it, and con&s;equently became le&s;s amiable in the eyes of the lady, and her hu&s;band more &s;o than ever; and thus, that virtue which had not lo&s;t all its claims to her &s;educed heart, &s;oon recalled it to its duty. Such a procedure as this, in &s;o delicate an affair, di&s;covers great knowledge of the human heart, and &s;till more of dominion over it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The army left Newport the 9th of June to go, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, to the Southward, and they are now actually at Providence. I am ju&s;t &s;etting out to join it, and if it continues its march. I make no doubt I &s;hall be enabled to entertain you with particulars &s;till more intere&s;ting.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FOUND the army at Providence, encamped on a ri&s;ing ground. This is a con&s;iderable town, and pretty well peopled; &s;ome of the hou&s;es are built of brick and others of wood; it is &s;ituated at the mouth of the river Patuxit, at the bottom of a bay betwixt the States of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, Connecticut, and Rhode-I&s;land: This &s;ituation affords it a gainful commerce in corn, maize, lumber, and &s;alt provi&s;ions for the I&s;lands; there are al&s;o many ve&s;&s;els built here.</P>
<P>This town is the capital of a colony of the &s;ame name, Provi|dence Plantation, now incorporated with the State of Rhode-I&s;land. A certain per&s;on, named Roger Williams, a mini&s;ter in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay, who had been bani&s;hed by the magi&s;trates for preaching up new doctrines, retired to this place with his followers, and founded a colony, giving it the name of <HI>Providence,</HI> in order to pre&s;erve to po&s;terity, the remembrance of the odious treatment he had experienced. He there lived forty years in a rational &s;olitude, wholly taken up with improving this infant &s;ettlement, and in|&s;tructing the Indians; he al&s;o writ &s;ome pieces again&s;t the princi|ples and practices of the Quakers, and, in the end, his regular

manner of life, and benevolent conduct forced his enemies to re|pent of the in&s;ults they had offered him. And thus you &s;ee, &s;ir, the annals of the new world furni&s;h examples of an intolerant &s;pi|rit among&s;t a people, who have upon almo&s;t every other occa&s;ion &s;howed them&s;elves the greate&s;t enemies to it.</P>
<P>How different are the objects that now &s;urround me, from tho&s;e which have hitherto taken up my time and attention! Bred up in the quiet retreats of the arts and &s;ciences; living con&s;tantly with tho&s;e, who either cultivated or patronized them, and always de&s;i|rous to make them the companions of my labours and my plea|&s;ures &mdash;what a change do I experience now, when I am tran&s;port|ed into the mid&s;t of the hurry of camps; all tumult and commotion around me, and experiencing every moment a thou&s;and wants! Here I am taught to fix the true value upon u&s;eful inventions, and di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e which are only curious and whim&s;ical. A &s;ingle &s;heet protects me from the inclemency of the weather; and being without books to divert my mind from the fatigues <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The difficulty of providing a &s;ufficiency of carriages, and finding provi&s;ion to &s;upport the hor&s;es or oxen, obliged Count Rochambeau to order, that no officer &s;hould carry with him more than one hundred and fifty pounds weight, including tents, beds, &amp;c and thus it hap|pened in our long march, in a country where there are &s;o few re&s;ources, that almo&s;t all of us were in want of &s;ome one nece&s;&s;ary or another.</NOTE> I feel, I frequently write, for want of ink, with the juice of an herb: hap|py, if I could re&s;t for any length of time in tranquillity&mdash;but no &s;uch thing&mdash;after two in the morning, the drum orders us univer|&s;ally out of our hard beds; in ha&s;te we roll up our travelling bed-furniture, mount our hor&s;es, and, with the &s;low pace of an Am|ba&s;&s;ador's train, follow the march of the foot-&s;oldiers, bending under the weight of the burden on their backs.</P>
<P>When, at length, arrived at the place de&s;tined for our encamp|ment, we have &s;till to wait during the hotte&s;t part of the day for the baggage waggons, before we can take any repo&s;e. The &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> has even &s;ometimes almo&s;t fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, before our weak &s;tomachs have begun to receive and dige&s;t the nece&s;&s;ary food: &s;tretched at full length upon the ground, and panting with thir&s;t, I have often wi&s;hed, like the rich man in the go&s;pel, that another <HI>Lazarus</HI> would dip his finger in the water, to cool my parched tongue. Our young Generals, who have been bred in ea&s;e and delicacy, bear up under the&s;e fatigues with a degree of re&s;olution that makes me blu&s;h for my weakne&s;s. Whil&s;t their tables, exhi|biting at the &s;ame time abundance and frugality, invite the offi|cers to a &s;tile of living which the want of dome&s;tics and other nece&s;&s;ary means would render it impo&s;&s;ible for them otherwi&s;e to enjoy, they encourage the &s;oldiery under the &s;everity of duty by marching before them on foot. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">M. le Vicomte de Noailles has in particular made a whole campaign on foot.</NOTE> What you will mo&s;t wonder at, is,

that the French never lo&s;e their cheerfulne&s;s and gaiety in the&s;e painful and laborious marches. The Americans, whom curio&s;ity brings by thou&s;ands to our camp, are con&s;tantly received with good humour and fe&s;tivity; and our military mu&s;ic, of which they are extravagantly fond, is then played for their diver&s;ion.

<P>The fathers of the families melt at the &s;ight of the&s;e affecting &s;cenes; even tho&s;e, who when they fir&s;t heard of our marching, viewing us through the medium of prejudice and mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion, had trembled for their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and for their lives.

The&s;e Americans being yet in that &s;tage of their national growth, wherein the di&s;tinctions of birth and rank are &s;carcely known, con|&s;ider the &s;oldier and the officer in the &s;ame point of view, and often a&s;k the latter, what his <HI>trade</HI> was in his own country; not being able to conceive, that the occupation of a &s;oldier may be as fixed and permanent as any trade whatever. The familiar appellation of <HI>brother,</HI> given &s;ome of them by the Marquis,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. le Marquis de la Fayette is univer&s;ally known to the Americans, by his title of <HI>Marquis.</HI></NOTE> excited their cu|rio&s;ity and re&s;pect to a great degree; and the young American La|dies have always con&s;idered it as one of their greate&s;t honours, to have danced with that nobleman.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the future &s;ucce&s;s of this army, it will always retain the glory of having made the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions in the&s;e countries, and rendered the memory of the French name dear and precious to all; an atchievement m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re flattering to true ambition, and perhaps more difficult to accompli&s;h, than gaining battles, or &s;preading univer&s;al conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Before I arrived here, I had no expectations of di&s;covering the traces of the French modes and fa&s;hions, in the mid&s;t of the wilds and fore&s;ts of America. The head dre&s;&s;es of all the women, except Quakers, are high, &s;preading and decked profu&s;ely with our gauzes: and here I cannot but reflect upon the oddne&s;s of their ta&s;te, when I find, through the whole &s;tate of Connecticut, &s;o prevailing an inclination for dre&s;s, (I may &s;ay to a degree of ex|travagance) with manners at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;imple and &s;o pure, as to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the ancient patriarchal age. Pul&s;e, Indian corn, and milk are their mo&s;t common kinds of food; they al&s;o u&s;e much <HI>tea,</HI> and this &s;ober infu&s;ion con&s;titutes the chief plea&s;ure of their lives; there is not a &s;ingle per&s;on to be found, who does not
<PB N="25" REF="018167_0025_0FA55ECB719BDC10">
drink it out of china cups and &s;aucers, and, upon your entering a hou&s;e, the greate&s;t mark of civility and welcome they can &s;how you, is to invite you to drink it with them. In countries where the inhabitants live upon foods and drinks of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial kind, it may be u&s;eful to the health, but I believe it is prejudicial in tho&s;e where they &s;ub&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly on vegetables and milk, e&s;pecially when the &s;oil, yet too much &s;haded by the woods, makes them the le&s;s nouri&s;hing; and perhaps this may be one of the cau&s;es, that with a robu&s;t and healthy con&s;titution, their lives here are much &s;horter than tho&s;e of the inhabitants of other countries. The lo&s;s of their teeth is al&s;o attributed to the too frequent u&s;e of tea; the women, who are commonly very hand&s;ome, are often, at eighteen or twenty years of age, entirely deprived of this mo&s;t precious ornament; though, I am of opinion, this premature decay may be rather the effect of warm bread: for the Engli&s;h, the Flemi&s;h, and the Dutch, who are great tea drinkers, pre&s;erve their teeth &s;ound a long time.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Connecticut, who rai&s;e &s;uch excellent corn, are, however, ignorant of the valuable art of rendering it more dige&s;tive, and con&s;equently more nouri&s;hing, by thorough fer|mentation and kneading; whenever they want bread, they make a cake, which they &s;et to bake at the fire upon a thin iron plate. The French, whom the war brought into America, never could accu&s;tom them&s;elves to this kind of bread, but did their endeavour to in&s;truct the natives how to bring it nearer to perfection: in the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s upon the road we found &s;ome tolerably good, but far inferior even to that made in our army. The inhabitants who re&s;ide at a di&s;tance from the high-ways pre&s;erve their ancient cu&s;toms in this and other particulars with great ob&s;tinacy, and believe no bread in the world to be better or more palatable than their own.</P>
<P>Scattered about among the fore&s;ts, the inhabitants have little intercour&s;e with each other, except when they go to church. Their dwelling-hou&s;es are &s;pacious, proper, airy, and built of wood, and are at lea&s;t one &s;tory in height, and herein they keep all their furniture and &s;ub&s;tance. In all of them that I have &s;een, I never failed to di&s;cover traces of their active and inventive genius.

<P>This country is inter&s;ected with an incredible number of rivers and rivulets; but Connecticut river is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the whole State; the town of Hartford, &s;ituate on its banks, is the capital, and con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of not more than four or five hun|dred hou&s;es, on a &s;treet two miles in length.

<P>But the monarch of the&s;e fore&s;ts is the <HI>tulip</HI> or <HI>yellow tree</HI>; its a&s;piring top ri&s;es above the loftie&s;t oaks, and its thick extended branches project their &s;hadow to a very great di&s;tance; its leaf compact, &s;mooth and &s;lender, is &s;omewhat in &s;hape like a man's hand, with this difference, that the longe&s;t &s;ide appears to be cut tran&s;ver&s;ely. Each leaf is originally folded in a particular wrapper, formed &s;imply of two other leaves, of an oval &s;hape touching in every point of their circumference; this principal leaf afterwards &s;eparates the two others in order to expand and give room for growth, in the &s;ame manner as a young bean &s;hoots out from between the leaves that confined it on each &s;ide. The tulip, that brilliant flower, upon which our Flori&s;ts lavi&s;h &s;uch a profu&s;ion of toil and expence, grows to the number of thou&s;ands upon this &s;tately tree, refre&s;hes the eye of the American native, and perfumes the air which he breathes beneath its &s;hade.

<P>THE chief object of our marching, was to form a junction with the army of General Wa&s;hington: this junction was effe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t|ed at Philip&s;burg. The Americans arrived there about the &s;ame time we did, having been before entr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nched upon the mountains of We&s;t-Point, that command the North-River. The &s;tream be|ing very narrow in this part, the Americans have built forts upon each &s;ide, the batteries of which traver&s;e each other. The fort up|on the left &s;ide, is &s;ituated upon a &s;lip of land that runs out into the river, covered on the ea&s;t by a mar&s;h, and only open on the north. An army is there in a &s;ituation to repel an attack from a far &s;uperior force, and the batteries of the forts can prevent any ve&s;&s;el whatever from &s;ailing farther up: This &s;ituation is the more important to the Americans, as the Engli&s;h are at pre&s;ent ma&s;ters of New-York, and con&s;equently command the entrance of the North-River.</P>
<P>As allies, we are encamped to the left of the Americans, and their right is extended upon the North-River, as l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w as Dobbs' ferry: our le&s;t is upon a little river called the Brunx. The po&s;i|tion of both armies is upon con&s;iderable heights, and a deep valley &s;eparates us. We are not more than fifteen miles from New York, but to get there, we &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity of marching down the whole length of the i&s;land, and traver&s;ing a coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry full of armed refugees.

<P>A march of two hundred and fifteen miles through the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive heats, in a country very defective in &s;upplies for an army, where the &s;oldier is often in want of bread, and is obliged to carry provi&s;ions for &s;everal days with him, has neverthele&s;s made fewer invalids among us, than if we had laid &s;till in a garri&s;on.

<P>The Engli&s;h, &s;ince our encamping with the Americans, having laid a plan to intercept the &s;upplies we received from the back country by means of the North-River, &s;ent up a twenty gun frigate, and &s;ome &s;loops as far as Tarry-town, a village &s;ituated &s;ix miles upon the right flank of the rear of the army. Two hun|dred men made an attempt to land, and the fir&s;t company that di&s;embarked had time to &s;et fire to &s;ome great gun carriages, to a batteau, and to take off another loaded with &s;ix thou&s;and rations of bread; but a &s;ergeant of the regiment of Soi&s;&s;onnais, and twelve &s;oldiers, forced them to re-embark, and even entered wai&s;t deep into the water to pur&s;ue them, and hindered the re&s;t from coming on &s;hore. This fir&s;t feat of the French arms in America gave the Engli&s;h &s;ome idea of what they were to expect from the united efforts of a whole corps. The commanding officers &s;trove who &s;hould be foremo&s;t in be&s;towing prai&s;es upon the&s;e brave &s;oldiers: "My general (an&s;wered the &s;ergeant to M. le Baron de Viomenil, who was extolling his bravery to the &s;kies) I am indebted to the good advice and bravery of my corporal for what I have done, for he perfectly &s;econded my endeavours." Courage is not a rare virtue in France, but mode&s;ty is &s;omewhat more &s;o, and yet this was a pattern of the mo&s;t perfect mode&s;ty, in a circum&s;tance very delicate for a &s;oldier. I have, I a&s;&s;ure you, heard with pain a &s;uperior officer find fault with the encomiums that were given the&s;e men, and blame M. le Baron de Viomenil for having afterwards invited them to dine with him.&mdash;Can virtue ever be too much honoured, or too well rewarded!</P>
<P>Batteries were erected in ha&s;te, as low as Dobbs's ferry, and when the Engli&s;h frigate and &s;loops came down, they had to &s;u&s;tain a very heavy cannonade: a &s;hell from a mortar piece &s;et the frigates &s;ails on fire, and terror and confu&s;ion &s;eemed pre|dominant among the crew, twenty-two of whom threw them&s;elves overboard into the river, and were mo&s;tly drowned.</P>

<P>Such are the ideas that ari&s;e in the mind, at the &s;ight of this great man, in examining the events in which he has had a &s;hare, or in li&s;tening to tho&s;e who&s;e duty obliges them to be near his per&s;on, and con&s;equently can be&s;t di&s;play his true character.&mdash;In all the&s;e exten&s;ive &s;tates, they con&s;ider him in the light of a beneficent God, di&s;pen&s;ing peace and happine&s;s around him&mdash;Old men, wo|men and children, pre&s;s about him when he accidentally pa&s;&s;es along, and think them&s;elves happy, once in their lives, to have &s;een him&mdash;they follow him through the towns with torches, and celebrate his arrival by public illuminations.&mdash;The Americans, that cool and &s;edate people, who in the mid&s;t of their mo&s;t trying difficulties, have attended only to the directions and impul&s;es of plain method and common rea&s;on, are rou&s;ed, animated and in|flamed at the very mention of his name; and the fir&s;t &s;ongs that &s;entiment or gratitude has dictated, have been to celebrate Ge|neral Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>It is uncertain how many men his army con&s;i&s;ts of exactly: &s;ome &s;ay, only four or five thou&s;and, but this General has always found means to conceal the real number, even from tho&s;e who compo&s;e it. Sometimes with a few troops he forms a &s;pacious camp, and increa&s;es the number of tents; at other times with a great number, he contracts it to a narrow compa&s;s; then again by detaching them in&s;en&s;ibly, the whole camp is nothing more than the mere &s;keleton and &s;hadow of an army, while the main body is tran&s;ported to a di&s;tant part of the country.</P>
<P>Neither do the&s;e troops in general wear regular uniforms; but the officers and corps of artillery are obliged, without exception, to &s;uch di&s;tinction. Several regiments have &s;mall white frocks, with fringes, which look well enough; al&s;o linen over-alls, large and full, which are very convenient in hot weather, and do not at all hinder the free u&s;e of the limbs in marching: with food le&s;s &s;ub&s;tantial, and a con&s;titution of body le&s;s vigorous than our p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o|ple, they are better able to &s;upport fatigue, and perhaps for that very rea&s;on. This advantage in dre&s;s, I believe, has not been &s;ufficiently con&s;idered in France. We are apt to con&s;ult the grati|fication of the eye too far, and forget that troops were de&s;igned to act, and not merely to &s;how them&s;elves and their finery. The mo&s;t proper apparel would be that, which being as little burden&s;ome as po&s;&s;ible, would cover the &s;oldier be&s;t, and in commande him the lea&s;t.

<P><PB N="36" REF="018167_0036_0FA55ED9D14E5BE0">The American military habit, altho' ea&s;y to be &s;oiled, is never|thele&s;s very decent and neat; this neatne&s;s is particularly ob&s;ervable among the officers, to &s;ee them, you would &s;uppo&s;e they were equipped with every nece&s;&s;ary in the complete&s;t manner, and yet upon entering their tents, where perhaps three or four re&s;ide together, I have often been a&s;toni&s;hed to find, that their whole travelling equipage and furniture would not weigh forty pounds; few or none have matra&s;&s;es; a &s;ingle rug or blanket, &s;tretched out upon the rough bark of a tree, &s;erves them for a bed; the &s;oldiers take the &s;ame precaution never to &s;leep on the ground, whil&s;t ours prefer it to any other way.</P>
<P>Their manner of living is very &s;imple, and gives them but little trouble; they content them&s;elves with broiling their meat, and parching their corn, or baking unleavened dough, made of Indian meal, upon the hot embers.</P>
<P>In &s;ome regiments they have negro companies, but always commanded by the whites.</P>
<P>Their di&s;cipline is exceeding &s;evere, and the power of the officers over the &s;oldiers is almo&s;t unlimited, la&s;hing them with whips, and beating them with canes for the &s;lighte&s;t faults: I, with &s;ome French officers, was accidentally a witne&s;s to their rigorous mode of cha&s;ti&s;ement; the criminal was tied to the wheels of a cannon carriage, his &s;houlders naked, his arms &s;tretched out, in order to give the mu&s;cles their greate&s;t ten&s;ion, and in this &s;ituation every &s;oldier of the company came up and gave him a certain number of &s;trokes, with a large whip, which &s;oon covered him with blood; what a&s;toni&s;hed us mo&s;t, and detained us the longer at this di&s;agreeable &s;pectacle, was, that two of the&s;e unhappy culprits, who both &s;uffered the &s;ame degree of puni&s;hment, never uttered the lea&s;t groan or complaint, or &s;howed any &s;igns of fear. Is this courage, or is the natural &s;en&s;ibility of mankind le&s;s acute among a people, where the air of the fore&s;ts and the con&s;tant u&s;age of tea and milk, &s;often and relax the fibres to a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing degree?</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the actual appearance of our Generals before New-York, the object of the pre&s;ent campaign remains very uncertain: &s;ome &s;ay the Americans are tired of the war, and di&s;contented with our inactivity, and for that rea&s;on the French army has joined them, &s;olely to re-animate their drooping courage. It is al&s;o reported, that &s;ince the defection of Arnold, General Wa&s;hington, not altogether &s;atisfied with the fidelity of his army, has come to a re&s;olution of tru&s;ting the important p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of We&s;t-Point to the French. The views of this general, in my opinion, extend farther than all this. We have ju&s;t learnt that <HI>M. de Barras,</HI> commander of our &s;quadron at Rhode-I&s;land, has received &s;ome tidings of <HI>M. de Gra&s;&s;e,</HI> and has &s;ent him a frigate, with a number of pilots on board for the&s;e coa&s;ts. This looks as if New-York was their object. That I&s;land and city is, at pre&s;ent, the general &s;tore hou&s;e of the Engli&s;h, and the centre of their operations; the
<PB N="37" REF="018167_0037_0FA55EDA79F612E0">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place enables them to hold an ea&s;y communication with their territories to the north and &s;outh, and at the &s;ame time to menace the interior parts of the adjacent country by means of Hud&s;on's river, and prevent the forces of the North-Ea&s;tern States from advancing to the Southward: it is al&s;o a &s;ecure receptacle for their fleets, where they can plan and prepare for their offen&s;ive operations, in the We&s;t India I&s;lands. The capture of this place would be a deci&s;ive &s;troke; and from the moment &s;uch an event takes place, the Engli&s;h mu&s;t forever renounce the hope of &s;ub|jecting the States; and in their pre&s;ent exhau&s;ted &s;ituation, I do not &s;ee how they would even repair the lo&s;s of the &s;tores and the troops.&mdash;Charle&s;town and Savannah, having to oppo&s;e the whole impre&s;&s;ion and &s;trength of the American continental forces, would make but a poor defence, and the I&s;lands, &s;till more difficult to be relieved by timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would lie entirely at the mercy of an enemy.</P>
<P>On the other hand, New-York is well fortified and defended, both by land and water, and the fortifications very exten&s;ive; it is, be&s;ides, garri&s;oned by the be&s;t troops of Great Britain, amounting to fifteen thou&s;and men, including the troops rai&s;ed in the country; &s;o that to lay &s;iege to New-York there would be wanting, be&s;ides a &s;uperior maritime force, at lea&s;t thirty thou&s;and men; whereas, our combined army does not amount to much more than ten thou&s;and; it is true the militia of the country may be collected, but the&s;e are nothing more than undi&s;ciplined troops, the duration of who&s;e &s;ervice is always limited; and what could &s;uch do again&s;t regular forces, well intrenched, and inured to all the dangers and hard&s;hips of war, for &s;ix or &s;even campaigns? Even the French army, however brave and well di&s;ciplined it may be, is compo&s;ed of troops, very few of whom have ever been actually in a battle. At any rate, a &s;iege of this place would be long and tedious, and as to the &s;quadron of M. de Gra&s;&s;e, we know it cannot leave the We&s;t-India I&s;lands till the Hurricane &s;ea&s;on comes on, and can only remain here during that &s;ea&s;on, otherwi&s;e his projected operations in tho&s;e &s;eas would fail, and our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions lie expo&s;ed to the enemy.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, this important expedition &s;hould fail, all would be ruined: the Americans exhau&s;ted, and di&s;couraged at the revolt of Arnold, panting after repo&s;e, and viewing us in the light of a feeble Ally, would lo&s;e cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age, turn their views towards peace, and perhaps purcha&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at any price whatever.</P>
<P>The South is, mo&s;t probably, the real object of this campaign: Tho&s;e States have for a long time felt all the mi&s;eries of war, and have been wa&s;ted alternately by friends and enemies. Virginia has been the &s;cene of the cruelties and deva&s;tations of Arnold; and Cornwallis, di&s;quieted at the news of our marching, has quitted Charle&s;town and traver&s;ed, with a large body of troops, the Caro|lina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Virginia; at the &s;ame time plundering the &s;ettlements,
<PB N="38" REF="018167_0038_0FA55EDB45356B78">
kidnapping the negroes, and &s;preading death and de&s;olation wher|ever he happened to march. So many repeated di&s;tre&s;&s;es and lo&s;&s;es have di&s;couraged the inhabitants, and inclined them to do any thing at all to better their &s;ituation. The arrival of our army among them, can alone free them from oppre&s;&s;ion, and revive their courage.</P>
<P>A certain <HI>warrior, [Marquis de la Fayette]</HI> at the head of twelve or fifteen hundred men, has neverthele&s;s found means to keep his ground all this time in Virginia; the impetuous Arnold, and the active Cornwallis, not daring to attempt any thing again&s;t him. You will doubtle&s;s &s;uppo&s;e, that this <HI>warrior</HI> is one of tho&s;e men, whom long experience and brilliant &s;ucce&s;&s;es, have rendered for|midable to the enemy. This leader, I a&s;&s;ure you, is a man of only twenty-four years of age, who has left the arms of an affec|tionate and amiable wife, a re&s;idence among plea&s;ures and high life, where his name, and an alliance with an illu&s;trious family, opened a way to the greate&s;t dignities, to come to this country, and, under the American FABIUS, defend the &s;acred cau&s;e of liberty, and learn to &s;erve his king and country. The word <HI>Marquis,</HI> which has been &s;o long u&s;ed among us, to characterize foppi&s;h ficklene&s;s and levity, univer&s;ally excites admiration and gratitude, at the very mention of of it, throughout the American world.</P>
<P>A &s;outhern expedition would be le&s;s hazardous in its nature, and le&s;s deci&s;ive in its effects, than here, but more pre&s;&s;ing upon the enemy, and promi&s;ing a more certain pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. We have intelligence, that Lord Cornwallis is fortifying at York, a &s;mall town in Virginia, &s;ituated upon a river of the &s;ame name. This news begins to elevate the &s;pirits of the French, who, if they could once hear of the arrival of M de Gra&s;&s;e, would conclude, that this campaign would not yet go over without &s;ome con&s;ider|able events.</P>
<P>Several of our officers employed their lei&s;ure time la&s;t winter, in making a tour to the &s;outhward. One of them, M. de Saint Victor, Captain in the regiment of Soi&s;&s;onnais, and well known to be very &s;killful in every particular that regards his profe&s;&s;ion as a &s;oldier, and who did not make this tour without reaping con&s;iderable ad|vantage from it, has viewed <HI>York,</HI> and judges it incapable of be|ing fortified to any great purpo&s;e, being de&s;titute of an opening for a retreat; &s;o that having a &s;quadron that could command Che&s;|apeak-Bay, in his opinion, we could &s;oon bring the enemy to what terms we plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is difficult, however, to per&s;uade one's &s;elf, that Cornwallis, who knows the country &s;o well, and has acquired &s;o much reputa|tion in this war, and who is by no means ignorant of the motions of our armies, would pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch upon &s;uch a &s;ituation, without he was convinced it would every way an&s;wer his purpo&s;es.

Neither was I exempt from the general misfortune; for I had imprudently advanced, un|accompanied, &s;ome miles before the army, and got into a road infe&s;ted with Refugees (who never grant quarter to Frenchmen) where a dome&s;tic of mine e&s;caped from them very narrowly, and had he not been armed, would doubtle&s;s have lo&s;t his life. They have lately hanged a Secretary belonging to one of our Commi&s;&s;a|ries, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated an officer of the legion of Lauzun; &s;o that I will confe&s;s to you, when I found my&s;elf alone and defencele&s;s in the&s;e woods, I was in dread of adding to the number of tho&s;e who have fallen victims to the re&s;entment of the&s;e enemies of republican|i&s;m; yet I had the good fortune to arrive &s;afe at the camp, having pa&s;&s;ed the night without tent or &s;helter of any &s;ort, &s;tretched out by a large fire, roa&s;ting on one &s;ide, and half drowned on the other, &mdash; and even found means to &s;leep &s;everal hours. How many of you rich &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uggards, under your gilt cielings, and upon your beds of down, have not been able to do as much!</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the country were greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee us returning the &s;ame road &s;o &s;oon, and the <HI>tories,</HI> with a malicious &s;neer, demanded <HI>if we were going to re&s;t from our labours:</HI> but it was not long before they di&s;covered the feint.</P>
<P>We were now advanced con&s;iderably up the North-river, and in three days were as high as King's ferry, but the Americans, having travelled along the river &s;ide, had arrived there before us.</P>
<P>Some have alledged, that if the Engli&s;h had &s;ent &s;ome armed ve&s;&s;els up the Hud&s;on, they might have retarded us con&s;iderably, and done us infinite mi&s;chief. The retrograde march that we made by order of General Wa&s;hington, was doubtle&s;s meant to divert

them from this attempt; but neverthele&s;s, after the trial they had of the abilities of our artillery men, they mu&s;t have known they would run a great ri&s;que of having their ve&s;&s;els de&s;troyed e&s;pecially if they had met with calms or contrary winds.</P>
<P>The allied army has cro&s;&s;ed a great part of the State of New-Jer&s;ey, drawing a large quantity of batteaus with them upon carriages, and always menacing Staten-I&s;land. It proceeds in two columns, the Americans forming that next to the &s;ea, although their number does not exceed five or &s;ix thou&s;and. The inactivity of the Engli&s;h, at this critical moment, is really incomprehen&s;ible; they might, without ri&s;quing a great deal, harra&s;s our army, and do us irreparable mi&s;chief, and they have all the rea&s;on in the world to make &s;uch an attempt, for altho' General Wa&s;hington has had the dexterity to keep them in uncertainty hitherto, they cannot be ignorant that we are in hourly expectations of the arrival of Count de Gra&s;&s;e upon the&s;e coa&s;ts; and they know that Admiral de Barras has embarked all his heavy cannon, and made prepara|tions for &s;ailing. It is their intere&s;t to prevent the junction of our forces, and what more favourable opportunity could there be, than when the army was marching through a country covered with &s;teep mountains, thick &s;et with woods, and inter&s;ected with rivers, and where for want of &s;upplies, the troops mu&s;t march in a le&s;s compact &s;tate than they would otherwi&s;e do.</P>
<P>There is now &s;carcely any doubt but that we are going to Virginia, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e the immediate arrival of Count de Gra&s;&s;e &s;hould oblige the army to return northwards.</P>
<P>This part of the country is wholly different from that we have hitherto traver&s;ed: it is not, like Connecticut, covered with &s;mall hills lying clo&s;e together, which render travelling difficult, ob&s;truct the view, and prevent one from forming a clear idea of the whole &s;cene. Many ridges of mountains, which &s;eem to be branches of the Apalachian, &s;tretch from north ea&s;t to &s;outh we&s;t, and form intervals of va&s;t and beautiful plains, which the hand of the geometrician &s;eems to have &s;moothed to a level. The&s;e plains are adorned with large and hand&s;ome edifices; and the country abounds with orchards, fields of wheat, rye, barley, indian corn, and flouri&s;hing woods.&mdash;The inhabitants, for the mo&s;t part of Al&s;acian and Dutch de&s;cent, are gay, ea&s;y and engaging in their manners, and re&s;emble the happy region they inhabit. Provi&s;ions are brought into our camp from all quarters; and tho&s;e that bring them are commonly wealthy people, and very unlike our traders in fruits and pul&s;e. You will often &s;ee the women decked with their head dre&s;&s;es and gauzes, riding in their farm waggons to market, drawn by the mo&s;t elegant hor&s;es.</P>

Be that as it will, the&s;e mountains mu&s;t have undergone great revolutions, for they are &s;plit a&s;under in many places, and fragments of a prodigious bulk are removed a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from their fir&s;t &s;ituation: upon one of the loftie&s;t of the&s;e hills, I met with a mon&s;trous block of &s;tone, &s;tand|ing by it&s;elf, rounded at its angles, &s;upported upon a very &s;mall ba&s;is, and apparently upon the point of tumbling down, and rolling away&mdash;what was its original po&s;ition, or who could have rai&s;ed it to this height?</P>

<P>WE were ye&s;terday encamped in the vicinity of a very agree|able little town; and although we are to day but twelve miles from it, we are come in view of another not at all inferior to it, in plea&s;antne&s;s and the &s;alubrity of the air, and &s;ituated to much better advantage: It is the large&s;t we have &s;een &s;ince our leaving Providence, and &s;tands upon the north ea&s;tern bank of the De|laware, twenty-&s;even miles above Philadelphia. This advan|tageous &s;ituation, makes it a place of con&s;iderable trade, and inter|cour&s;e with the capital of Penn&s;ylvania, e&s;pecially in the article of provi&s;ions. The Delaware is navigable thus far up, for ve&s;&s;els of &s;ome tolerable burden, but afterwards becomes all at once &s;o &s;hal|low, that a little above the town carriages may pa&s;s &s;afely over at the fording places, when the tide is out. The &s;hores of this river have nothing of that gloomy and &s;avage a&s;pect ob&s;ervable on the Hud&s;on; they are, on the contrary, as level and plea&s;ant as tho&s;e of the Loire. The &s;oil is light here, as well as in mo&s;t other places we have &s;een, but at the &s;ame time very excellent. The maize, or
<PB N="43" REF="018167_0043_0FA55EDF058C2698">
Indian corn, a plant that infinitely exhau&s;ts the ground, grows luxuriant here, even in tho&s;e lands which have been cultivated for a century pa&s;t, and is in height from &s;even to eight feet; the &s;talks are plump and vigorous, and the ears long and heavy.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington has rendered this place famous to the late&s;t times, by a victory, in which he &s;o happily di&s;clo&s;ed the amazing re&s;ources of his genius.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h troops in 1776, being arranged in cantonments, formed a line from Brun&s;wick, on the river Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, to the Delaware; fourteen or fifteen hundred men were at Trenton, as many at Bordentown, and a third corps of equal &s;trength at Burlington, which is only twenty miles from Philadelphia. Gene|ral Wa&s;hington's army, which had &s;carcely dared to &s;how it&s;elf the whole campaign, and was every day growing weaker and weaker, left the Engli&s;h in enjoyment of the greate&s;t &s;ecurity, and only two nights freezing weather would have enabled them to cro&s;s the Delaware on the ice, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia. In this critical &s;ituation of affairs the <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> retired to Baltimore in Maryland, and America, with dread and con&s;ternation, beheld the fatal moment approaching, when her chains were to be rivetted on her forever.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington, not finding him&s;elf in a &s;ituation to make head again&s;t the united force of the enemy, formed a de&s;ign of attacking them &s;eparately: In ha&s;te he collected the militia of Penn|&s;ylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, and divided the whole into three bodies; two could not pa&s;s the Delaware for the ice, but that party under the direction of the General him&s;elf was more fortunate; for he cro&s;&s;ed the river, and after a &s;mart conflict, took above nine hundred He&s;&s;ians pri&s;oners. A &s;hort time afterwards, having kin|dled fires through his camp, and left one man to take care of each, he marched round about, and came upon the rear of the enemy, &s;ur|pri&s;ed them once more, near Princeton, and obliged another con|&s;iderable body to &s;urrender their arms. The Engli&s;h were then, in their turn, forced to retire, and put them&s;elves on the defen&s;ive.</P>

<P>THE arrival of the French army at Philadelphia was more like a triumph, than &s;imply a pa&s;&s;ing through the place: the troops made a halt about a quarter of a league from the city, and in an in&s;tant were dre&s;&s;ed as elegantly as ever the &s;oldiers of a garri&s;on were upon a day of review: they then marched through the town, with the military mu&s;ic playing before them, which is always particularly plea&s;ing to the Americans; the &s;treets were crowded wiih people, and the ladies appeared at the windows in their mo&s;t brilliant attire. All Philadelphia was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee people, who had endured the fatigues of a long journey, &s;o ruddy and hand&s;ome, and even wondered that there could po&s;&s;ibly be <HI>Frenchmen</HI> of &s;o genteel an appearance.</P>
<P>The troops next marched in a &s;ingle file before the Congre&s;s, and M. le Chevalier de la Luzerne, mini&s;ter from the court of France, and afterwards encamped in a large plain contiguous to the river Schuylkill. The next day after our arrival, the regiment of Soi&s;&s;onnais went through the exerci&s;e of the fire arms: at lea&s;t twenty thou&s;and per&s;ons, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a va&s;t number of carriages, remarka|ble for their lightne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">legance, added to the lu&s;tre of this exhibition, which was &s;till heightened by the plea&s;antne&s;s of the &s;ituation, and the remarkable &s;erenity of the day. The rapidity of the military evolutions, the &s;oldierly appearance of the troops in general, and the exactne&s;s of their motions, &s;urpri&s;ed and enrap|tured the beholders, but their attention was &s;till more excited, when they beheld in one of our chiefs, the relation and friend of that young <HI>Hero</HI> to whom they are &s;o much indebted, and for whom they profe&s;s an admiration ari&s;ing almo&s;t to enthu&s;ia&s;m: a lo&s;s, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">He had &s;ome days before received the news of his daughter's death.</NOTE> (which one mu&s;t be a father, and of great &s;en&s;ibility too, to have a ju&s;t idea of) had for &s;ome days rendered him a prey to grief and melancholy; not even the charms of Philadelphia could draw him from his tent; and like another Achilles, nothing but the cla&s;h of arms could make him forget his &s;orrow.</P>
<P>We were a good deal amu&s;ed with a mi&s;take of &s;ome of the com|mon people, who took for a great General one of tho&s;e alert fel|lows, whom our commanding officers commonly have in their reti|nue,
<PB N="45" REF="018167_0045_0FA55EE08F471260">
to run up and down to carry their written orders. His &s;hort tight bodied coat, his rich wai&s;tcoat with a &s;ilver fringe, his ro&s;e-coloured &s;hoes, his cap adorned with a coat of arms, and his cane with an enormous head,&mdash;all appeared to them &s;o many token<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of extraordinary dignity. Altho' he approached his ma&s;ter, the Co|lonel commandant, merely to receive and publi&s;h his orders, they imagined that he gave them of his own accord, and directed the movements of the troops, independent of any &s;uperior.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Honourable Thomas M'Kean, E&s;quire, was then Pre&s;ident.</NOTE> in a &s;uit of black velvet, honoured this review with his pre&s;ence. The&s;e hone&s;t Penn&s;ylvanians differ very con&s;iderably from us in the ceremonies of dre&s;s, as we differ from them again in our modes of legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>The manoeuvres of our troops rai&s;ed the mo&s;t flattering expecta|tions in the minds of the &s;pectators; and they did not he&s;itate to declare, that &s;uch &s;oldiers were invincible.</P>
<P>This day was de&s;tined for favourable omens. M. le Chevalier de la Luzerne, who, upon this occa&s;ion, received his countrymen with the dignity and genero&s;ity of the repre&s;entative of a great Monarch, and the frankne&s;s and cordiality of an individual, after the review, invited all the officers to dine with him. Hardly were we &s;eated at the table, when an expre&s;s arrived: a di&s;quieting &s;ilence immediately &s;eized every gue&s;t&mdash;our eyes were fixed upon the Che|valier de la Luzerne, every one endeavouring to gue&s;s what the me&s;&s;age would turn out to be.&mdash;
<Q>Thirty-&s;ix &s;hips of the line, &s;aid he, commanded by Mon&s;ieur le Comte de Gra&s;&s;e, are arrived in Che&s;apeak-Bay, and three thou&s;and men have landed and opened a communication with the Marquis de la Fayette.</Q>
&mdash;Joy and good humour, immediately re&s;umed their place on every countenance&mdash;Our impatient leaders began to count the days, and reckon how long it would be before they would have it in their power to face the enemy; and their heated imaginations made the time much &s;horter than it afterwards proved to be. Healths were next drank; and that of the Mini&s;ter of the marine of France was not forgotten, who&s;e activity and great abilities, have paved the way to the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;&s;es of our fleet: The pre&s;ence of his &s;on, M. le Comte de Charlu, &s;econd Colonel of the regiment of Saintonge, added &s;till more to our plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Among others, Charles Thom&s;on, the Secretary of Congre&s;s, the &s;oul of that political body, came al&s;o to receive and pre&s;ent his compliments. His meagre figure; furrowed countenance; his hollow &s;parkling eyes; his white, &s;traight hair, that did not hang quite as low as his ears, fixed our thorough attention, and filled us with &s;urprize and admiration.</P>
<P>The important news of the arrival of Count de Gra&s;&s;e, was &s;oon &s;pread throughout the city, and echoes of joy were heard from every quarter: Some merry fellows mounted upon &s;caf|folds and &s;tages, pronounced funeral orations for Cornwallis,
<PB N="46" REF="018167_0046_0FA55EE14390DB68">
and uttered lamentati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s upon the grief and di&s;tre&s;s of the Tories. The people ran in crowds to the re&s;idence of the Mini&s;ter of France; and <HI>long live Louis the Sixteenth,</HI> was the general cry.</P>
<P>Thus, you &s;ee, the people are univer&s;ally per&s;uaded of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of this expedition.&mdash;Could the&s;e flattering hopes be realized, they would ha&s;ten a peace, which in our &s;ituation, and under the wi&s;e and benevolent Prince that governs us, would place France in a point of view, that has been wholly unknown &s;ince the exi&s;tence of her monarchy.</P>
<P>Philadelphia, the capital of Penn&s;ylvania, is built upon an ele|vated and exten&s;ive plain, a little above the confluence, and be|tween the two rivers, Delaware and Schuylkill. The famous William Penn, founder of this colony, gave the plan, and pointed out the &s;ituation. His plan has been followed, but the town is built upon the principal river for the conveniency of trade. Its form is an oblong, extending two miles in length, and having eight &s;treets perfectly parallel to each other, cro&s;&s;ed at right an|gles by &s;ixteen others, of near a mile in length, equally wide and as exactly parallel. Care has been taken to leave vacancies for public edifices. The two principal &s;treets, <HI>Front-&s;treet,</HI> and <HI>Market-&s;treet,</HI> are each one hundred feet broad. Ve&s;&s;els of five hundred tons can lie afloat, by the mo&s;t convenient wharffs; and I &s;aw more than twenty &s;hips at once upon the &s;tocks. The town contains at lea&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and hou&s;es, for the mo&s;t part built of brick, and all extremely hand&s;ome; the people are computed to be about forty thou&s;and &s;ouls. The Roman Catholics have two chapels here, governed by an Engli&s;h ex-Je&s;uit, and a G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rman Prie&s;t, who reckon the number of their communicants at about eleven or twelve hundred. There are al&s;o churches for the Pre&s;byterians, Lutherans, Dutch Calvini&s;ts, Anabapti&s;ts, &amp;c. but the mo&s;t nu|merous &s;ect is that of the Quakers, and of this per&s;ua&s;ion was the founder of the colony.</P>

The mildne&s;s of the climate, the goodne&s;s of the &s;oil, their rural occupations, and a &s;olitary mode of life, fa|voured the views of their legi&s;lature, and Penn&s;ylvania &s;oon be|came the mo&s;t virtuous and happy colony that hi&s;tory has ever re|corded. But by the increa&s;e of inhabitants, by the flocking in of &s;trangers, and its becoming a commercial &s;ettlement, the fortunes of individuals were enlarged, luxury was introduced, the manners of the people in&s;en&s;ibly changed, and that <HI>golden age,</HI> which was here realized, was &s;oon con&s;idered as nothing more than a brilliant
<PB N="47" REF="018167_0047_0FA55EE22E218E18">
meteor, which blazed out a moment to the a&s;toni&s;hed world, and di&s;appeared forever.</P>
<P>In this city the repre&s;entatives of the thirteen States, denomi|nated the <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> hold their re&s;idence. The front of the edifice in which they &s;it, is of brick, and con&s;equently without any of the orders of architecture; it is, however, as hand&s;ome as any &s;tructure in this ta&s;te can be, and pre&s;ents to the eye a noble, &s;olid, regular ma&s;s. It is placed in the common range of the hou&s;es, without any con&s;iderable interval of &s;eparation, and certainly lo&s;es much of its beauty becau&s;e you have no proper &s;tand to examine it in the requi&s;ite point of view: Each individual State &s;ends its deputies hither to con&s;ult upon its intere&s;ts, make its propo&s;als and concert means for the defence of the common cau&s;e. This a&s;&s;embly has no concern with any matters further than what re&s;pects the general intere&s;t of all the States, each having its particular a&s;&s;embly, who make laws and provide for the &s;upport of their civil govern|ment, independent of the general Congre&s;s. The number of repre&s;entatives is always in proportion to the extent and importance of the &s;everal States that &s;end them&mdash;the fewe&s;t that can be &s;ent are <HI>two,</HI> and <HI>&s;even</HI> the mo&s;t, but how many &s;oever there be, the repre&s;entatives of each &s;tate have but one voice. The central po&s;ition of this town, and its natural &s;ecurity of &s;ituation has decided the choice in its favour. The fir&s;t Congre&s;s was held here the fifth of September 1774, and the act of Independence was pa&s;&s;ed July 4th, 1776; at a period, when the affairs of America looked dark and gloomy, when a very numerous fleet and army &s;urround|ed all the avenues to New-York, and threatened de&s;truction to the very exi&s;tence of liberty in America.</P>
<P>The market-hou&s;e, &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of the city, is large and hand&s;ome. The pri&s;ons for Debtors and criminals, as well as that de&s;igned for pri&s;oners of war, are &s;pacious and airy.</P>
<P>You have heard of their Philo&s;ophical Society, of which many learned men in Europe are members. But the e&s;tabli&s;hment that does the mo&s;t honour to the&s;e ri&s;ing States, is a Ho&s;pital intended to receive the defenders of their country, when wounds and infir|mities render them incapable of providing for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The plan of William Penn is yet far from being accompli&s;hed, but is perfected more and more as the town enlarges: it is ea&s;y to judge what an amazing growth it has had, when we find an old man yet alive in Philadelphia, who remembers when the very fir&s;t &s;tone of it was laid. This town, &s;ituated on a river where ve&s;&s;els of war may ea&s;ily come up, and upon a fertile &s;oil which requires little labour to cultivate it, and built after a well con&s;idered plan, cannot fail of becoming in time one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t beauti|ful cities in the world</P>

It was with difficulty that we could even procure &s;hallops and boats, for the mo&s;t part open, to take in the grenadiers, cha&s;&s;eurs and &s;ome American regiments: in ca&s;e of bad weather the&s;e troops will &s;uffer much and run a con&s;iderable ri&s;k of being drowned; General Wa&s;hington and Count Rochambeau, have advanced on by land, to concert their plans of operation with M. de Gra&s;&s;e. M. le Baron de Viomenil, the immediate commander of the French army, has determined likewi&s;e to go all the way by land.</P>
<P>Baltimore is, from its &s;ituation, one of the mo&s;t important places of all North-America.&mdash;Placed almo&s;t at the head of the Bay, it lies convenient to receive the produce of Penn&s;ylvania, the Delaware &s;tate, and e&s;pecially the commodities of Maryland. This la&s;t mentioned &s;tate has very con&s;iderable iron forges, and pro|duces a &s;pecies of tobacco of a le&s;s plea&s;ing &s;mell than that of Vir|ginia, but infinitely more &s;trong, and for that rea&s;on preferred by the people of the north of Europe.</P>
<P>Thirty years ago, Baltimore was only an incon&s;iderable village; at pre&s;ent it is a large wealthy town, built nearly in the &s;hape of a cre&s;cent or half-moon, The northern part of it, is &s;ituated upon a narrow &s;lip of land, that projects a con&s;iderable di&s;tance into the Bay, and is &s;o low, that the town in this place, apparently ri&s;es out of the bo&s;om of the waters, and already &s;eems to anticipate its future dominion and grandeur.</P>
<P>Lord Baltimore, an Iri&s;h Catholic, formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed two hun|dred of his per&s;ua&s;ion in this place, and gave his name to the &s;ettlement. About one quarter of it is peopled by tho&s;e unfortunate Acadians, and their de&s;cendents, whom the Engli&s;h cruelly forced away from their own happy country,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The be&s;t of Nova Scotia is that part called by the French <HI>Acadia,</HI> where a number of that nation fir&s;t &s;ettled in <HI>1604.</HI> The&s;e people were known by the name of Neutrals, and lived in a perfect State of independence after the Province was given up to England, having &s;worn never to act again&s;t their native country, to which, as well as to their religion and prie&s;ts, they were mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tically attached. Soon after the year <HI>1749,</HI> perceiving the Engli&s;h encroach|ing upon them, they determined rather to remove to New France (Canada) than run the ri&s;que of having their religion contaminated by an intermixture with heretics. But the Engli&s;h getting notice of their de&s;ign, &s;eized upon all who were not yet gone, and embarked them on board their &s;hips, in which they were tran&s;ported to different parts of the then Engli&s;h Colonies, where the greater part of them &s;oon died of grief and vexation.</NOTE> to leave them de&s;titute and
<PB N="49" REF="018167_0049_0FA55EE438E61210">
poor in a region where they were utter &s;trangers. Their quarter is the meane&s;t in appearance, and wor&s;t built of all, and the tyranny of the Briti&s;h government has, till lately, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndered them from gaining any thing by the happy &s;ituation of this town; but being for the mo&s;t part &s;ea-faring men it is hoped they will not fail, in time, to make up by commerce the lo&s;s of their fertile &s;ettlements in Acadia.</P>
<P>They &s;till pre&s;erve the French language among them, and are prodigiou&s;ly attached to whatever regards the nation from which they originated, e&s;pecially in their religious wor&s;hip, which they keep up with a &s;trictne&s;s that would have done honour to the pri|mitive ages of chri&s;tianity. Their way of life is plain and &s;imple, and their manners &s;imilar to tho&s;e prevalent among them while they were yet in the happy region of Acadia. The prie&s;ts there exerci&s;ed that authority over them which virtue and education allow, over men who are not yet corrupt in their morals, they were their judges and their mediators, and to this day the&s;e exiled peo|ple never mention their names without tears.</P>
<P>They told me a great deal about a <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Clere,</HI> who, at their departure, gave them ve&s;&s;els and ornaments for the &s;ervice of the altar.
<Q>The&s;e ornaments (&s;aid the good old man) will &s;erve to recall to your minds what you owe to the religion of your fathers: can it flouri&s;h&mdash;can it even exi&s;t in tho&s;e new regions which you are now going to inhabit! While you reprove all other creeds and modes of wor&s;hip, can you &s;how by your gen|tlene&s;s, good will and beneficence, that you &s;till hold them as brethren, who are of a different faith! Perhaps Providence is making you its in&s;truments to extend the divine truths of the go&s;pel, and render them prevalent in &s;ome other region of the world. This reflection alone &s;upports me under the &s;orrow and pangs of parting, but wherever you may be forced by the will of heaven, rely upon it, my heart will always follow you, and never, never will I rai&s;e my trembling hands to the &s;acred altars of the Divinity, but you &s;hall be the deare&s;t objects of my prayers.</Q></P>
<P>Their chapel is built without the town upon a height, near four or five churches of different &s;ects. They complain much, that they do not find in their pre&s;ent mini&s;ters, the zeal and affection of tho&s;e in Acadia: taken up with their temporal concerns, they be&s;tow few in&s;tructions upon their flock, and their whole pa&s;toral function &s;eems confined to &s;aying low ma&s;s once a month.</P>

<P>THE army was to pro&s;ecute the re&s;t of the march to Virginia by land, and with that view took the road leading to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> a flouri&s;hing commercial town upon the Potomack; but upon the news of the arrival of the Romulus &s;hip of war, with two frigates and a number of tran&s;ports, we turned off towards Annapolis, but the hor&s;es and carriages continued their journey by land.</P>
<P>As we advance towards the &s;outh we ob&s;erve a &s;en&s;ible difference in the manners and cu&s;toms of the people. We no longer find, as in Connecticut, hou&s;es &s;ituated along the road at &s;mall di&s;tances, ju&s;t large enough to contain a &s;ingle family, and the hou&s;hold furniture nothing more than is barely nece&s;&s;ary; here are &s;pacious habitations, con&s;i&s;ting of different buildings, at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, &s;urrounded with plantations that extend beyond the reach of the eye, cultivated not by the hands of freemen, but by tho&s;e unhappy blacks, whom European avarice and inju&s;tice has taken from their native regions of Africa to cultivate po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions not their own, in a foreign &s;oil.

<P>THE army has had a very agreeable pa&s;&s;age hither, except the grenadiers, cha&s;&s;eurs, and the fir&s;t American regiments,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e &s;ailed from the Head of Elk.</NOTE> who were fourteen days on the water. Judge how inconvenient this mu&s;t have been to troops crowded into a narrow &s;pace, and without any decks over them; while even the officers had nothing but bi&s;cuit to live upon. The &s;hores of this Bay, which is formed by the influx of &s;o many great rivers, are far from being lofty, neither are they much cleared of the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds, and it is but rarely that you di&s;cover any habitations; but the few we &s;aw were very agreeably &s;ituated. This country will be, in time, one of the mo&s;t beautiful in the world.</P>
<P>When our little fleet had &s;ailed up James-River, celebrated for the excellent tobacco which grows upon its &s;hores, we di&s;embark|ed at James-Town, the place where the Engli&s;h fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in Virginia. The troops have already joined the grena|diers, cha&s;&s;eurs, and the three thou&s;and men brought hither by Count de Gra&s;&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of the regiments of <HI>Agenois, Gatinois</HI> and <HI>Touraine,</HI> under the command of Mon&s;. de St. Simon, Mare|chal de Camp. This General had a little before, effected a junc|tion with fifteen hundred or two thou&s;and Americans, commanded
<PB N="52" REF="018167_0052_0FA55EEA78C38268">
by M. le Marquis de la Fayette, who, as you have heard, could never be reduced, notwith&s;tanding the forces of Cornwallis were three or four times his number. I &s;hould have mentioned, that M. de la Fayette, in quality of Major-General of an American ar|my, at the age of twenty-four years, found him&s;elf at this time &s;u|perior in command to a French general officer, and continued &s;o till the other detachments of the army were collected into one bo|dy, under General Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>William&s;burg, tho' con&s;iderable, as the capital of Virginia, is in other re&s;pects a place of little importance: it is &s;ituated upon a plain, level piece of land, and the main &s;treet, pa&s;&s;ing through the mid&s;t of it, is more than one hundred feet in width: at one of the extremities, and fronting the &s;treet is the capitol, or &s;tate-hou&s;e, a &s;mall but regular building; and at the other end is the college, capable of containing more than three hundred &s;tudents: there is a library belonging to it of about three thou&s;and volumes, and an apparatus for experimental philo&s;ophy, tolerably complete. With the mo&s;t lively &s;atisfaction I contemplated the&s;e monuments of the real glory of men; and while I contemplated them, they re|called to my mind places and per&s;ons mo&s;t intimately connected with my heart. The tumult of arms has driven from hence, tho&s;e who had the care of the&s;e philo&s;ophical in&s;truments, for the mu&s;es you know, take no plea&s;ure but in the abodes of peace: We could only meet with one &s;olitary profe&s;&s;or, of Italian extraction; and I cannot but &s;ay, his conver&s;ation and abilities appeared to be &s;uch, that after what he had told us in commendation of his brethren, we could not help regretting their ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>William&s;burg does not contain above a hundred and fifty hou&s;es, and is the only town we have yet &s;een in Virginia worth mentioning: not &s;ituated on the banks of any river, it &s;tands at an equal di&s;tance from two &s;mall ones, one of which falls into York, the other into James River. It is &s;ubject to the inconveniency of &s;carcity of good water. What makes the &s;ituation of this place valuable, is the neighbourhood of James and York rivers, between which grows the be&s;t tobacco in the whole State, and for this rea&s;on it &s;eems to have been built where it is: I do not think, neverthele&s;s, that it will ever be a place of any great importance; the towns of York, James, Norfolk, and Edenton, being more favourably &s;ituated for trade, will undoubtedly eclip&s;e it.</P>
<P>Although Virginia extends from the 36th. to the 39th. degree of north latitude, the winters are very &s;evere, and great quantities of &s;now &s;ometimes fall. The &s;outhern and ea&s;tern winds are ex|ce&s;&s;ive warm, and tho&s;e from the north and we&s;t, coming over mountains and lakes, equally cold. In a days time there will often be a rapid tran&s;ition from one extreme to the other. The country produces &s;everal very excellent kinds of wood, and about William&s;|burg and the &s;hores of the bay, the land is covered with trees yielding rozin; the meadows and mar&s;hes &s;ub&s;i&s;t great numbers of excellent hor&s;es, which far exceed tho&s;e of the other States in point
<PB N="53" REF="018167_0053_0FA55EECB2757330">
of beauty: Va&s;t quanties of hemp are rai&s;ed here, as well as flax, Indian corn and cotton: The cotton &s;hrubs produce annually, and at the fir&s;t view we took them for beans in blo&s;&s;om. Silk worms &s;uc|ceed here very well, and it is not improbable but they may at &s;ome future time form one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branches of trade in this &s;tate. The commodity mo&s;t in demand is tobacco; you well know the character it has, and for common u&s;e it may be con&s;idered as the be&s;t in the world: What the Engli&s;h imported yearly from this &s;tate, and from Maryland, might have amounted to about ninety-&s;ix thou&s;and hog&s;heads; but among them&s;elves they did not con&s;ume one &s;ixth part of that quantity, and either di&s;po&s;ed of the re&s;t among us, or exported it to the north: judge then how valuable this commerce was to that nation. They purcha&s;ed it here at the very lowe&s;t rate, taking it in exchange for their broad|cloths, linen and hard wares, and &s;elling again for ready money what they did not want for their own home con&s;umption, and thus they increa&s;ed their capital every year to the amount of eight or nine millions. No other of their po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ions, not even tho&s;e in India, ever afforded them &s;o clear a profit. Three hundred and thirty ve&s;&s;els, and about four thou&s;and &s;ailors were con&s;tantly em|ployed in this trade: of the&s;e the city of Gla&s;gow, in Scotland, owned the greate&s;t part, and by that means &s;upported its flouri&s;hing manufactures, which were perhaps more con&s;iderable than tho&s;e of any town in England.</P>
<P>Since the war, the tobacco exportation has been only about forty thou&s;and hog&s;heads annually; what advantages then would have accrued to the Engli&s;h, could they have &s;ooner made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of Che&s;apeake-bay. There are now fifty or &s;ixty ve&s;&s;els collected at York, under the cannon of Cornwallis, &s;ent on purpo&s;e to load with this weed, which three fourths and a half of the human race take &s;uch &s;upreme delight in chewing, &s;nuffing or &s;moking.</P>
<P>The population of Virginia, is computed at one hundred and fifty thou&s;and whites, and five hundred thou&s;and negroes. There is a &s;till greater di&s;proportion between the whites and blacks in Maryland, where there are not more than twenty thou&s;and whites, and at lea&s;t two hundred thou&s;and negroes. The Engli&s;h imported into the&s;e two provinces, between &s;even and eight thou&s;and yearly. Perhaps the lot of the&s;e &s;laves is not quite &s;o hard as that of the ne|groes in the I&s;lands; their liberty, it is true, is irreparably lo&s;t in b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th places, but here they are treated with more mildne&s;s, and are &s;upported upon the &s;ame kind of food with their ma&s;ters; and if the earth which they cultivate, is moi&s;tened with their &s;weat, it has never been known to blu&s;h with their blood. The Ameri|can, not at all indu&s;trious by nature, is con&s;iderate enough not to expect too much from his &s;lave, who in &s;uch circum&s;tances, has fewer motives to be laborious than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The great rivers, which water this province, have their &s;ource in the blue mountains, a chain of which runs through the whole coun|try, from north to &s;outh. Beyond the&s;e rolls the Ohio, through va&s;t fore&s;ts and meadows, in a &s;erpentine cour&s;e, till it unites with
<PB N="54" REF="018167_0054_0FA55EED52F30B30">
the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi: according to the reports of travellers, the fine&s;t and mo&s;t fertile countries in the world extend along the &s;hores of this river, which are neverthele&s;s as yet but ill explored. It is &s;aid, that General Wa&s;hington had in contemplation, if he could not break the chains of his country, to go and e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf there with tho&s;e, whom the love of liberty and independence &s;hould incline to partake of his fate and fortune.</P>
<P>As you advance to the &s;outhward, the different degrees of heat are ob&s;ervable by the difference of the vegetable productions The gum-laurel ri&s;es here into a tree, and the &s;a&s;&s;afras becomes tall and &s;tately. We took notice in Maryland, of a fruit very com|mon there, &s;harp ta&s;ted and bitteri&s;h before it was ripe, but, like our &s;orb apples, lu&s;cious, in&s;ipid and flabby, when come to matu|rity, being about the bigne&s;s of a plumb, and of a bright yellow.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the plants here are odoriferous: the white <HI>flower-ever|la&s;ting,</HI> of which the fields are full, is remarkably &s;o.&mdash;The cat|terpillars differ entirely from tho&s;e of Europe, being covered with tufts, which hide both their heads and feet: the&s;e tufts are long, clo&s;e and &s;mooth as if they had been trimmed with &s;ci&s;&s;ors; &s;ome are all over of one colour, &s;uch as a very fine vermillion, others are chequered with regular &s;pots.</P>
<P>We found near the North-River, in the &s;tate of New-York, ano|ther &s;pecies of this in&s;ect, remarkable for its &s;ize and beauty. M. le Chevalier de Chattelux,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. le Chevalier de Chattelux, Marechal de Camp, one of the forty members of the French academy, it Major-General in the army of Count Rochambeau.</NOTE> whom the great affairs of an army do not entirely preclude from allotting &s;ome moments to literary amu&s;e|ment, made me a pre&s;ent of one, which I have delineated upon paper: it was about four inches long, and had &s;even or eight rings pa&s;&s;ing round the body; its &s;kin was thin and of a light green, through which you might perceive the motion of the blood in the arteries; his eye-balls were about the bigne&s;s of a pea, and his tail of a deep yellow; each of his rings had four little branchy horns, hard and of a jet black, about two twelfths of an inch long: his head was armed with eight more, more than an inch in length, &s;trong, branchy, and bent towards each other, yellow, and black towards the extremities, and poli&s;hed in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite man|ner. This &s;tately in&s;ect lets us know, by the arrogance of its car|riage, that it is not ignorant of the noble dre&s;s it wears, and &s;eems con&s;cious of a natural &s;uperiority over its fellow worms.</P>

I then got up and

As the nervous &s;y&s;tem was only attacked by the poi&s;on, it is plain the alkaline &s;alts could but have increa&s;ed the irritation.

Such approaches as the&s;e are not commonly made without great circum&s;pection, &s;ince the encampments mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be multiplied in proportion as you draw near to the enemy, but the impatience of the troops for action rendered them rather too venture&s;ome on this occa&s;ion, not he&s;itating to march twelve miles in the face of the enemy through dangerous woods, upon a loo&s;e, &s;andy &s;oil, and through the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive heats. One of our young Colonels went &s;o far, as to u&s;e every argument he could think of to prevail upon General Wa&s;hington to &s;uffer him to attack two redoubts that lay in our way. The General referred the matter to M. le Comte de Rocham|beau, to whom he had intru&s;ted the immediate direction of the &s;iege, but Count Rochambeau thought it more prudent to give the troops a little time for repo&s;e, and reconnoitre the places, before he made any attempt of that kind.</P>
<P>A body of Americans, headed by the Marquis de la Fayette, compo&s;ed the right column, and the French, preceded by their grenadiers and cha&s;&s;eurs formed the left. The army of M. le Compte de Rochambeau, con&s;i&s;ting of the regiments of <HI>Bourbon|nais, Royal Deux Ponts, Soi&s;&s;onnais</HI> and <HI>Saintonge</HI> was placed in the center: The troops under the command of <HI>M. de Saint Simon</HI> extended to the left as far as <HI>York</HI> river, and the Americans occu|pied the right, flanked by the &s;ame river.</P>
<P>On the thirtieth, the enemy evacuated the two redoubts, which the young Colonel was for attacking upon our fir&s;t arrival: they were di&s;tant about four hundred toi&s;es [eight hundred yards] from their main works, and upon their leaving them, the French immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of October in the night, the Americans began two redoubts to the right of the others. The enemy di&s;covering this, in&s;tantly turned their fire that way, and as we expected, &s;everal of the American work men were killed. This, however, did not at all intimidate their companions, who held on at their bu&s;ine&s;s with the &s;ame ardour as if no &s;uch accident had happened. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were militia men, to whom the &s;iege was a &s;pectacle altogether new.</NOTE></P>
<P>The army was bu&s;y, till the &s;ixth, in con&s;tructing long and &s;hort fa&s;cines, gabions, and landing the Artillery and ammuniti|on. We were &s;oon after in a &s;ituation to open the trenches. The regiments of Bourbonnais and Soi&s;&s;onnais, commanded by Baron de Viomenil, and fifteen hundred Americans under the Marquis de la Fayette, po&s;ted them&s;elves all night in a deep ravine to protect the fifteen hundred workmen on the right. At the &s;ame time the regiment de Touraine opened the intrenchment on the left, and rai&s;ed a battery over again&s;t a redoubt, detached from their main works, and intended to keep off the fire directed from the right of the enemy. The act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vity of the workmen and the natural loo&s;e|ne&s;s

of the &s;oil, to our great a&s;toni&s;hment, put the parallel into a &s;tate to receive the troops on the next day. They entered it about noon, with drums beating.</P>
<P>The opening of the trenches, which is ordinarily the mo&s;t fatal period of a &s;iege, was in this in&s;tance executed without the effu&s;ion of blood; a circum&s;tance the more fortunate, as the wounded would have been unprovided with &s;traw to lie on, and linen rags for the dre&s;&s;ing of their wounds. This was performed on the 7th: on the 8th and 9th they laboured hard in con&s;tructing batteries, which were pro&s;ecuted with &s;uch expedition that tho&s;e of the Americans and Mon&s;ieur de Saint Simon opened about five in the evening. The latter &s;oon forced a frigate to move from her moorings, that had been very trouble&s;ome in firing upon our en|campments; they al&s;o levelled a red hot ball at the Charon, a forty-four gun &s;hip, and burnt her, as they did likewi&s;e a &s;loop, The batteries of Count Rochambeau began to play on the tenth, at &s;even in the morning; and now the difference of the two firings could ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed; that of the enemy was &s;low and irregular, while ours was bri&s;k and well &s;upported. Our engineers had pitched upon the mo&s;t advantageous po&s;itions, and the artil|lery men made every di&s;charge take effect by the exactne&s;s of their aim, and their alertne&s;s in working the guns.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis had not prepared his troops for &s;uch &s;alutations as the&s;e; he had a&s;&s;ured them, on the contrary, "that we were unprovided with battering cannon, and had only &s;ome field pieces; that our troops were raw and un&s;killed in war, and that tho&s;e of M. de Saint Simon in particular, were nothing better than undi&s;ci|plined vagabonds, collected in the We&s;t Indies, enervated by a hot climate, and would &s;oon be conquered, were it only by the fir&s;t attacks of the cold weather, prevalent in the&s;e countries: and as to the American troops, they knew very well what di&s;tre&s;&s;ed cir|cum&s;tances they were in; and finally, that powerful &s;uccours from New-York would &s;oon put them in a &s;ituation to be&s;iege the be&s;iegers."</P>
<P>This harangue did but increa&s;e their con&s;ternation. As &s;oon as they began to hear the terrible roaring of our batteries, we that were on the heights &s;aw them flying precipitately from their redoubts, while their batteries in an in&s;tant were entirely &s;ilenced. They had been quiet &s;pectators of our labours, and we now became &s;o in our turn with re&s;pect to them. At this time I watched an opportunity to traver&s;e our lines, which con&s;i&s;ted of a large ditch, broad enough for carriages to travel in, about four feet in depth, and covered by a rampart of gabions, or cylindrical ba&s;kets, fixed upon the ground, by means of projecting &s;takes, filled and covered over with loo&s;e dirt, and forming a height of about &s;even feet on the &s;ide towards the enemy. The batteries were placed upon platforms, on the in&s;ide of the ditch, rai&s;ed and &s;trengthened with pali&s;adoes. The quarter next the enemy was covered by a large parapet, in which were the embra&s;ures for the cannon: all the&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="018167_0058_0FA55EF1056925A8">
works, as well as mo&s;t of tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h con&s;i&s;ted wholly of earth.</P>
<P>I now beheld the cannon, tho&s;e infernal machines, playing with the utmo&s;t fury; I &s;aw the rapid bullet &s;triking or rebounding from the redoubts of the enemy, and driving thro' the air the planks and timber, which formed the embra&s;ures for the great guns. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ours were made of fa&s;cines, and con&s;equently were le&s;s expo&s;ed to be damaged by the fire of the enemy.</NOTE> I followed with my eye, in its parabolic path, the &s;low and de&s;tructive bomb, &s;ometimes burying it&s;elf in the roofs of hou&s;es, &s;ometimes when it bur&s;t, rai&s;ing clouds of du&s;t and rubbi&s;h from the ruins of the buildings, at other times blowing the un|fortunate wretches, that happened to be within its reach, more than twenty feet high in the air, and letting them fall at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance mo&s;t pitiably torn. Such terrible &s;ights as the&s;e fix and captivate the attention, and fill the mind at the &s;ame in&s;tant with trouble, wonder and con&s;ternation. "The be&s;ieged, (&s;aid the de&s;erters) are in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; not knowing where to fly, death &s;eizes them even in the arms of &s;leep: and the General, unea&s;y at the di&s;content of the He&s;&s;ians, no longer confides his advanced guard to any but the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers."</P>
<P>We had to pa&s;s to our entrenchments through a narrow defile, where the enemy principally directed their fire, and the fir&s;t lodgment for &s;uch as &s;hould chance to be wounded was but a &s;mall di&s;tance off. I advanced thither as fa&s;t as my health and &s;trength would permit, and perceived that the bullets often fell upon the fa&s;cine cabbin in which we were. I here ob&s;erved, in the dead of night, the different degrees of celerity betwixt the fla&s;h, the &s;ound, and the projected body. The light preceded the &s;ound, and the &s;ound the &s;troke, but at a much le&s;s con&s;iderable interval of time.</P>
<P><HI>Tarleton,</HI> that impetuous leader, who had &s;pread terror through their whole march from Carolina, on the day that the batteries of Count Rochambeau began to play made a &s;ally by way of Gloce&s;ter, at the head of his legion con&s;i&s;ting of four hundred picked men. M. le Choi&s;i, Brigadier General, then marched again&s;t him with a part of his troops, who together with M. le Duc de Lauzun, at the head of his Hu&s;&s;ars, repul&s;ed him with the lo&s;s of about fifty of his men: this event was a thunder &s;troke to the inhabitants of the country, who had hitherto believed Tarleton invincible, and formed a judgment of his talents from the boldne&s;s of his thefts and robberies.</P>
<P>In the night of the eleventh we opened a &s;econd parallel, at about three hundred yards from the enemy's main works: a prodigious quantity of royal grenades, or &s;mall bombs, from the enemy di&s;turbed the workmen a good deal, which did not however prevent them from going on with alacrity; but we now relaxed the fire of our artillery for fear of doing them damage by our &s;hot, as
<PB N="59" REF="018167_0059_0FA55EF1ADF7AB70">
well as becau&s;e we began to demoli&s;h our old batteries to con&s;truct new ones. At this time the fire of the enemy became bri&s;ker than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>True bravery manife&s;ts it&s;elf chiefly in &s;ieges. The confu&s;ion, the hurry, the example of others, all contribute during a battle, to rou&s;e, move and animate the mo&s;t timid, who, in an in&s;tant be|come &s;uperior to them&s;elves: but in the long continued fatigues of a &s;iege, where dangers are ince&s;tantly growing out of each other, where, in the &s;ilence and &s;olitude of darkne&s;s we have to face death with coolne&s;s and unconcern, to reflect on its con&s;equences and horrors with calmne&s;s, and &s;et the real lo&s;s of life in competition with the uncertainty of our hopes and expectations in a &s;tate of futurity, then it is that the courage of a warrior proves it&s;elf to &s;pring from an unbounded love of honour, and an invincible attachment to his duty.</P>
<P>The French, in this &s;iege, &s;eemed to become rivals to each other; and each officer envied the lot of him who was &s;ent upon attempts of the greate&s;t danger; they hurried away, with a curio&s;ity which I cannot but call ra&s;hne&s;s and madne&s;s, to examine the works of the enemy, and ha&s;ten the progre&s;s of our own. Even the ob|&s;cure common &s;oldier, who&s;e life and death is equally con&s;igned to oblivion, &s;trove to outdo his renowned officers in the&s;e daring en|terprizes, and went up in defiance of the enemy to the very edges of their intrenchments. The miner, with the axe in his hand, advanced with a determined &s;tep through a &s;hower of grape &s;hot to cut down the tree at his lei&s;ure, which perhaps &s;hielded him from de&s;truction. The corps of artillery, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by the abilities and intrepidity of their officers, were no le&s;s &s;o by the ac|tivity, &s;pirit and courage of their &s;oldiery.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;oldiers of the&s;e corps, are no way inferior to the others in bravery, capacity, and a fondne&s;s for doing their duty. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s they are not &s;o fatigued by con&s;tant exerci&s;e, nor &s;ubjected to &s;o &s;e|vere a di&s;cipline as the others, and therefore if the &s;ame ends can be accompli&s;hed by more &s;imple methods, le&s;s fatiguing to the officers, and le&s;s hard upon the &s;oldiers, why &s;hould we he&s;itate to prefer that mode which is the ea&s;ie&s;t?</NOTE> General Wa&s;hing|ton him&s;elf beheld the effects of this daring &s;pirit with a&s;toni&s;h|ment; a bomb or a bullet, fortunately pointed, excited in them the lively emotions of an eager hunt&s;man, who is upon the point of &s;eizing his prey.</P>
<P>A gunner, at one of the embra&s;ures, had his foot carried away by a bullet. I tried to con&s;ole the unhappy man in the fir&s;t mo|ments of his angui&s;h, when he gave me for an&s;wer,&mdash;"I am le&s;s afflicted for the lo&s;s of my foot, than for being &s;o unfortunate as not to have had time, before it happened, to di&s;charge the cannon I had pointed with &s;o much care!"&mdash;He &s;oon after died of his wound, and never cea&s;ed to complain, till the la&s;t, of the failure he had made in firing the piece.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="018167_0060_0FA55EF27601E5B0">As long as we were working at the batteries of the &s;econd pa|rallel, the fire of the enemy was ince&s;&s;antly kept up. The works, that were carried on with the greate&s;t vigour, were not, however, extended as far as the a&s;&s;ailants wi&s;hed. They demanded, with vehement exclamations, to be led on to attack the two detached redoubts, which incommoded them much, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which, would enable them to enfilade a part of the works of the enemy: The eager valour of the Baron de Viomenil, was particu|larly impatient of re&s;traint in this enterprize, when, at length, on the 14th, he was ordered to attack one of them, having under him Count William de Deux Ponts, &s;econd Colonel of the regiment of Royal Deux Ponts, and M. le Chevalier de Lameth, Aide-Marechal: The Marquis de la Fayette commanded the attack up|on the other, and M. de Gimat was placed under his direction &mdash; both redoubts were taken &s;word in hand; but unfortuately Count William was wounded, and the Chevalier de Lameth mortally in both his knees.</P>
<P>The following night four hundred of the be&s;ieged, pretending to be Americans, &s;urpri&s;ed one of our batteries, nailed up &s;even pieces of cannon, killed &s;ome &s;oldiers, made a few pri&s;oners, and wounded about thirty: a lad of fifteen years old, &s;ervant to an officer, who was &s;leeping ju&s;t by, was &s;tabbed with a bayonet in thirteen or fourteen different parts of his body. The regiment of Soi&s;&s;onnais, which was po&s;ted a &s;mall di&s;tance off, knew nothing of this affair till it was over, becau&s;e the officer who commanded the redoubt had given orders not to fire, or make an alarm at the approach of the&s;e pretended Americans; this regiment, however, &s;oon ha&s;tened up, and had not the Lieutenant Colonel of Saintonge &s;ounded a retreat, the Engli&s;h would have been completely &s;ur|rounded. Several of the enemies &s;oldiers were wounded and brought to our ho&s;pitals, and the men who a moment before had been cutting each others throats, were now collected under the &s;ame roof, and received, indi&s;criminately, the &s;ame care and attention. And thus it is, that in the mid&s;t of the horrors that di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;grace our nature, there are &s;till &s;ome traces left of the once noble and exalted di&s;po&s;ition of mankind.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth, our new batteries began to play; broke &s;ome palli&s;adoes, and even made a breach in the enemy's works. Lord Cornwallis finding him&s;elf upon the point of being torn and cru&s;hed from every quarter, now took the de&s;perate re&s;olution of pa&s;&s;ing over in the night to Gloce&s;ter, a po&s;t &s;till le&s;s capable of defence than York. Bad weather, how|ever, hindered him from accompli&s;hing his purpo&s;e, and on the &s;eventeenth, at ten in the morning, he &s;ent a flag to a&s;k a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for twenty-four hours: the deputies were reminded of the behaviour of their Generals at Charle&s;town and Savannah in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, and had their reque&s;t refu&s;ed. Another flag then came out propo&s;ing a &s;urrender, when two hours &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms was granted them, which term was afterwards prolonged.

Lord Cornwallis de&s;ired to know what terms of capitulation were to be allowed him.&mdash; "THOSE OF CHARLESTOWN," an&s;wered General Wa&s;hington, with &s;pirit and judgment.</P>
<P>By thus recalling a victory to their remembrance, in which they had manife&s;ted the mo&s;t overbearing in&s;olence, he taught them to treat the Americans in a different manner, for the time to come, when they &s;hould happen to fall under their power.

<P><PB N="64" REF="018167_0064_0FA55EF573349CB0">The nineteenth about four in the afternoon, the Engli&s;h and He&s;&s;ians filed off, with their colours ca&s;ed, betwixt the French and American armies, at the head of which were General Wa&s;hington and Count Rochambeau: the garri&s;on at Gloce&s;ter marched out before the troops of M. de Choi&s;i. Lord Cornwallis pretended &s;ickne&s;s, to avoid appearing on this occa&s;ion, and it was &s;aid, he gave him&s;elf up entirely to vexation and de&s;pair: indeed it was no wonder, for he now &s;aw the fruit of many years &s;ucce&s;s vani&s;h in a moment; the painful, laborious march he had made through the de&s;ert, half peopled region of North-Carolina, in order to conquer Virginia, was now entirely lo&s;t. An army, by whom he was almo&s;t adored, con&s;i&s;ting of more than &s;even thou|&s;and choice troops, were obliged to &s;urrender their arms to an enemy as much depi&s;ed as hated; twelve thou&s;and mu&s;quets, more than two hundred pieces of Iron and Bra&s;s cannon, and a prodigious quantity of warlike &s;tores were now transferred into hands that would inevitably turn them to the di&s;advantage of his country; he moreover &s;aw their marine deprived at once of fifteen hundred &s;ailors and &s;ixty &s;quare-rigged ve&s;&s;els, exclu&s;ive of a &s;hip of forty-four guns and two frigates, be&s;ides the total lo&s;s of the commercial productions of Virginia.</P>
<P>The two lines of the combined army were more than a mile in length; the Americans were to the right: but the di&s;proportion ob&s;ervable among them in point of age and &s;ize, and the di&s;&s;imi|larity of their dre&s;s, which was al&s;o dirty and ragged, &s;et off the French to great advantage, who, notwith&s;tanding &s;o much fatigue, maintained at all times an erect, &s;oldierly and vigorous air. But we were all &s;urpri&s;ed at the good condition of the Engli&s;h troops, as well as their cleanline&s;s of dre&s;s; to account for their good appearance, Cornwallis had opened all the &s;tores to the &s;oldiers before the capitulation took place.

<P>THE American war, the &s;ucce&s;s of which has appeared &s;o dubious, offers to our view two events, almo&s;t unparalleled in any war that hi&s;tory has recorded in her annals: I mean two entire armies made pri&s;oners, who neverthele&s;s were urder the di|rection of Generals of the fir&s;t note and ability. It now remains to a&s;k, which of the two has di&s;covered the deepe&s;t talents, and the mo&s;t activity, or experienced the greate&s;t ob&s;tacles, and com|mitted the mo&s;t mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>Being my&s;elf a witne&s;s to the efforts of one army, and &s;urround|ed by per&s;ons who had a &s;hare in reducing the other, having al&s;o in my hands &s;ome exact and faithful accounts of that affair, I will venture a few reflections.</P>
<P>Let us in the fir&s;t place take a cur&s;ory view of Burgoyne's cam|paign, and we &s;hall be the better enabled to compare him with his brother in misfortune, <HI>Lord Cornwallis.</HI></P>
<P>Burgoyne, formed by nature with an active, enterpri&s;ing di&s;po|&s;ition, animated by a mo&s;t extravagant love of glory, a favorite al&s;o of the court of London, was furni&s;hed amply with the means of &s;ecuring the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;s. His army con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even thou&s;and one hundred and &s;eventy three regular troops, Engli&s;h and Germans, exclu&s;ive of a corps of artillery, and &s;even or eight hundred men, under the orders of Colonel St. Leger: all his offi|cers were men of approved merit, and he was provided with a con|&s;iderable train of artillery and ammunition of every &s;ort. Guy Carleton, Governor of Canada, who had the care of furni&s;hing the particular articles, forgot nothing that might contribute to the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the expedition. The &s;ervices this governor had rendered to the crown,&mdash;the pre&s;ervation of Canada, which was owing to his exertions alone, and the perfect knowledge he had of the whole country, &s;eem to have given him the be&s;t preten&s;ions to the
<PB N="67" REF="018167_0067_0FA55EFBCC491888">
chief command, but he had a &s;pirit great enough to forget this piece of inju&s;tice;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They have now made him their commander in chief in North-America, in the room of Sir Henry Clinton. Misfortunes are nece&s;|&s;ary in every country to &s;ilence cabal and intrigue, and render impar|tial ju&s;tice to merit; but it too often happens, that applications to real|ly de&s;erving men come too late to be of any &s;ervice.</NOTE> and went &s;o far in favour of his rival, as to con&s;ent to make treaties with the &s;avages, tho' contrary to his own private opinion, and from them obtained a con&s;iderable body of Indians and warriors. The un&s;teady, capricious temper of the&s;e people, their barbarous and bloody cu&s;toms, their thir&s;t for plun|der, their infidelity in fulfilling their engagements, did not all hinder the Engli&s;h from making them the companions of their expected conque&s;ts: Burgoyne harangued them with an eloquent oration on the &s;hores of Lake Champlaine, calculated to inflame their courage and re&s;train their barbarity. But what influence can eloquence have over the minds of tho&s;e men, who in their whole language have not two words to &s;ignify <HI>equity</HI> and <HI>humanity.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e Savages being parcelled out into numerous tribes, have con&s;equently manners more or le&s;s barbarous; &s;everal of them take the membrane that covers the &s;cull, from the enemies they kill in bat|tle, and carry it off in triumph, with the hair on, and even drink their blood.</P>
<P>The Spaniards have been reproached for exerci&s;ing cruelties upon the inhabitants of the countries they conquered; but it appears that re|proaches of this kind are no le&s;s well founded again&s;t the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>An Indian &s;peech that was given me by a profe&s;&s;or at William&s;burg, a tran&s;lation of which is &s;ubjoined, is a proof of this. It di&s;covers at the &s;ame time, the bold and ma&s;culine energy with which the&s;e &s;a|vages are taught by nature to expre&s;s them&s;elves.</P>

<P><PB N="68" REF="018167_0068_0FA55EFD275B3DB8">The fir&s;t attempts of Burgoyne before Ticonderoga, were crown|ed with the mo&s;t flattering &s;ucce&s;s. This place, built by the French, in 1756, is &s;ituated we&s;tward, towards the &s;treight that pre&s;erves the communication between the Lakes <HI>George,</HI> and <HI>Cham|plaine,</HI> upon a point of land covered with &s;harp rocks, and hemmed in by water on three &s;ides. The part adjoining the main land is covered by a deep mar&s;h, and defended by the old French lines: to the&s;e the Americans had added &s;everal other works, and a group of fortifications, called by them a <HI>block-hou&s;e.</HI> They al&s;o fortified the &s;ummit and the foot of a high mountain, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, called <HI>Mount Independence,</HI> and with a&s;toni&s;hing ardour and indu|&s;try united both the&s;e po&s;ts, by a bridge thown over the &s;treight, &s;upported by twenty-two huge piles, each fifty feet long and twelve thick, fa&s;tened together by cramp irons and large chains.</P>
<P>Lake Champlaine was, on the &s;ide next the bridge, defended by a boom, compo&s;ed of beams la&s;hed together, and wound round with chains. By this means a communication was not only kept up between the two po&s;ts, but no po&s;&s;ibility of acce&s;s offered on the northern &s;ide.</P>
<P>Although Ticonderoga is of it&s;elf lofty, it is neverthele&s;s com|manded, in eminence, by another mountain called <HI>Sugar Hill,</HI> from its being in the form of a &s;ugar loaf. The Americans had entertained thoughts of fortifying it, but concluded that the works were already too exten&s;ive for their means of defence, and ex|pected that its difficulty of acce&s;s, and the rocky inequality of its &s;urface would hinder the enemy from taking advantage of its &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The royal army advanced with great caution along the &s;ides of the lake, having in the center their fleet, which, on its coming up, anchored within cannon &s;hot of the enemy. On the approach of the right wing, the Americans, to the great &s;urpri&s;e of the royali&s;ts, abandoned their works on the &s;ide next Lake George, and &s;et fire to them: Major General Philips then took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an advantageous po&s;t on Mount <HI>Hope,</HI> which, be&s;ides that it commanded their lines, cut off their communication with the lake. It is &s;aid the Americans &s;hewed but little courage in defend|ing the other po&s;ts on this &s;ide as well as on the other.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h army advanced with an equal celerity on the other &s;ide of the lake, and in a &s;hort time inve&s;ted all their works. The advantages that Sugar Hill pre&s;ented, &s;oon determined the Engli&s;h to build redoubts there, and the paths they were obliged to climb, upon a rugged and almo&s;t perpendicular &s;urface, did not hinder the alert Major General Philips from erecting his works in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>The American Generals now thought proper to hold a council of war, in which was repre&s;ented, "that they had not above half the nece&s;&s;ary number of working hands, that the nece&s;&s;ity for labour increa&s;ed as the hands dimini&s;hed, and that the place would be inevitably and completely inve&s;ted in le&s;s than twenty-four
<PB N="69" REF="018167_0069_0FA55EFFC94DDDD0">
hours." It was then unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to evacuate the po&s;t, which was immediately put in execution.</P>
<P>It has been &s;ince a&s;ked, with a degree of reproach, "why, if the forces were not &s;ufficient to defend it, did they not withdraw the troops; remove the artillery and &s;tores and demoli&s;h the fortifications before the arrival of the enemy? Why did they wait to be &s;urrounded, at an in&s;tant when a retreat was apparently more prejudicial than a &s;urrender upon &s;uch terms as might have been granted, and which would have been infinitely preferable to the ri&s;que they ran of having their fortifications carried by a&s;&s;ault?."</P>
<P>Immediately, upon the determination of the council to evacuate the place, the American army embarked their baggage, their artillery, and their provi&s;ions in a decked ve&s;&s;el, and more than two hundred batteaus, e&s;corted by five gallies; directing their cour&s;e towards Skene&s;borough, while the garri&s;on marched towards Ca&s;tletown.</P>
<P>The next morning the royali&s;ts having di&s;covered the precipitate flight of the Americans, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge and fortifi|cations, and this enormous ma&s;s, which had co&s;t more than twenty months labour, was now cut up in le&s;s time than it would take to relate it. By five in the morning, the frigates <HI>Royal George,</HI> and <HI>Inflexible</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;hip was built in twenty eight days and mounted eighteen twelve pounders.</NOTE> had a free pa&s;&s;age through, and Burgoyne lo&s;t no time in pur&s;uing the enemy by water, whil&s;t the troops marched after them by land. He overtook them, at length, near <HI>Skene&s;|borough falls,</HI> where he &s;eized two of the gallies, and blew up three others. The Americans, being now in a de&s;perate &s;ituation, &s;et fire to their batteaus, mills and fortifications, and &s;aved them|&s;elves in the woods, unprovided, and de&s;titute of every thing.</P>
<P>Confu&s;ion and di&s;may predominated in like manner among the forces on the left; the &s;oldiers no longer obeyed the commands of their officers, and in this &s;ituation Brigadier General Frazer came up with their rear guard, with a body of troops far inferior, and attacked them, expecting every moment to be joined by General Reid&s;el. The Americans, at fir&s;t defended them&s;elves bravely, but at the coming up of the la&s;t mentioned commander, they fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d precipitately, after lo&s;ing a con&s;iderable number of their men, together with Colonel Francis, their leader, and one of their brave&s;t officers. General Saint-Clair, who commanded the van+guard, when informed of the&s;e di&s;a&s;trous circum&s;tances, took immediately to the woods, in doubt whether to march to the upper parts of Connecticut or towards Fort Edward. Colonel Hill was detached from Skene&s;borough, with the ninth regiment towards Fort Anne, and on his way, fell in, with a body of American troops, &s;ix times as numerous as his own, which he defeated after three hours engaging. The Americans then burnt Fort Anne, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to Fort Edward upon Hud&s;on's river.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="018167_0070_0FA55F001C4194E0">General Saint-Clair arrived at Fort Edward, (where General Schuyler commanded,) with the remains of his army, after a march of &s;even days, in a mo&s;t deplorable condition, having &s;uffered every di&s;tre&s;s that imagination can conceive, from the bad quality of the water, and want of cloaths and provi&s;ions: He was here joined by the other fugitives, equally weak, fatigued and di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>Burgoyne, without lo&s;ing time, &s;et out from Skene&s;borough, on his march to Fort Edward, but encountered great difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments, although the di&s;tance is not very con&s;iderable; for the country is naturally &s;o wild, &s;o de&s;ert, &s;o incumbered with mar&s;hes, inter&s;ected with creek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and the enemy had &s;o increa&s;ed the&s;e natural ob&s;tacles by huge lines of abbatis, that it is not ea&s;y to conceive how much he had to &s;uffer in &s;urmounting the&s;e difficulties. He had to con&s;truct near forty bridges or cau&s;eways, and one of them, made of trunks of trees, was more than a mile in length. It is true, he might have avoided all this trouble in taking his rout round by Ticonderoga, but he feared a retrograde movement of his army might give the Americans time to recover their courage, and &s;lacken the ardour of his own troops.</P>
<P>It is worth while to ob&s;erve, that in all this di&s;tre&s;s, misfortune, and univer&s;al con&s;ternation, not a &s;ingle di&s;trict in America &s;eemed in the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to come in, or make its &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The danger did not di&s;courage even tho&s;e States which were mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the depredations of the enemy; under the direction of the Congre&s;s they all united with the greate&s;t vigour to repul&s;e them; and General Arnold was di&s;patched to the Northern army with a train of artillery, furni&s;hed him by General Wa&s;hington on purpo&s;e for this expedition. At his arrival, he ordered the troops from Saratoga to a place called <HI>Stillwater,</HI> in order to be in a better &s;ituation to check the progre&s;s of Colonel Saint Leger, who was advancing toward the Mohawk river. His troops, however, (St. Leger's) &s;uffered great lo&s;&s;es from the Indians: the efforts of Burgoyne not being &s;ufficient to re&s;train their cruelty, friends as well as enemies fell alike victims to their thir&s;t of blood. The murder of Mi&s;s <HI>M'Crea,</HI> in particular, &s;truck terror into every heart: She was then in the bloom and innocence of beauty and youth, her father was attached to the royal party, and upon the very day that &s;he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll a &s;acrifice to the wanton barbarity of the &s;avages, &s;he was to have been married to an Engli&s;h officer.</P>
<P>Scenes &s;o &s;hocking as the&s;e, irritated the people almo&s;t to di&s;trac|tion, and kindled a &s;pirit of hatred, even in the di&s;affected, again&s;t a government capable of accepting <HI>allies,</HI> more di&s;po&s;ed to extir|pate than &s;ubdue the people, whom they claimed as &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The Americans now began to think it their duty to defend not only the rights of their country, but al&s;o tho&s;e that nature her&s;elf had given them. Each citizen became a &s;oldier, and when their regular forces &s;eemed almo&s;t annihilated, de&s;pair poured forth mul|titudes, &s;till more formidable, from the woods, the mountains, and the borders of the mar&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="018167_0071_0FA55F00AD268090">It was now that Burgoyne's army began to experience real diffi|culties, in the neighbourhood of Fort Edward;&mdash;in proportion as they advanced, ob&s;tacles multiplied on every &s;ide; for fifteen days, they were employed in bringing down batteaus and provi&s;ions from Fort George to Hud&s;on's river, a di&s;tance of more than eigh|teen miles: this exce&s;&s;ive labour was quite unequal to the wa&s;te of time and provi&s;ions; they did not receive one third of the hor&s;es they expected from Canada, on account of the length of the way, and the great number of water pa&s;&s;ages; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on they could not collect more than fifty pair of oxen; heavy rains added &s;till more to their difficulties, and in the end, they found it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h magazines to continue their operations.</P>
<P>Intelligence was at la&s;t received, that Colonel Saint Leger had arrived before, and was directing his views again&s;t, Fort Stanwix: Burgoyne upon this, concluded, with &s;ome rea&s;on, that if he could pro&s;ecute his march rapidly forward, and advance down the Mo|hawk river, &s;uppo&s;ing at the &s;ame time Colonel Saint Leger to &s;ucceed in his attack on the fort, he &s;hould draw the enemy be|tween two fires, or at lea&s;t have it in his power to force them to change their &s;ituation, and retreat to a greater di&s;tance, which would consequently open the Mohawk country to him, and afford him the means of executing his intended junction.</P>
<P>However ju&s;t this plan might be, it could not be carried into execution for want of provi&s;ions, to connect &s;o long a chain of po&s;ts with Fort George; and becau&s;e the enemy had a body of troops at <HI>White-Creek,</HI> &s;ufficient to break it.</P>
<P>He abandoned this project then, and fell upon a &s;cheme of &s;ur|pri&s;ing Bennington, where the Americans had great &s;tores of corn and cattle. Bennington lies between two branches of the river <HI>Hoo&s;ick,</HI> about twenty miles ea&s;t of the Hud&s;on, a place of little importance, and incapable by its &s;ituation of ever becoming con|&s;iderable, unle&s;s &s;ome remarkable changes &s;hould take place. This expedition Burgoyne intru&s;ted to Colonel Baum, a German, and gave him five hundred men, and two pieces of artillery for the purpo&s;e; and to be the better enabled to make the be&s;t of &s;uch ad|vantages as &s;hould be gained, he fixed his main camp before Sara|toga, and made a bridge of boats over the river, upon which the advanced corps might pa&s;s. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the corps of Colonel Breyman, con&s;i&s;ting of light infantry, was po&s;ted at <HI>Battenkill,</HI> with a de&s;ign, if nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;upport Colonel Baum. The latter, in his march, fell in with a &s;mall provi&s;ion convoy of the enemy, which he took: But the want of waggons and hor&s;es, made his march &s;o long and fatiguing, that the Americans got intelligence of his de&s;ign, and had time to prepare to receive him. The Colonel, upon his approach to the place, finding that his force was not &s;ufficient to make an attack, with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, po&s;ted him&s;elf in as favourable a &s;ituation as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ent off an expre&s;s to the General. Breyman then had orders to reinforce Colonel Baum, without lo&s;s of time: He obeyed, but
<PB N="72" REF="018167_0072_0FA55F0173531960">
his march was long and difficult, meeting with nothing but bad water and bad roads; the want of hor&s;es and wheel carriages, add|ed &s;till more to his embarra&s;&s;ments, and a long continuance of heavy rains, rendered his condition almo&s;t as wretched as can po&s;&s;i|bly be conceived. But the American General, Starke, who com|manded the Bennington militia, effectually prevented their junc|tion. He marched on the 16th of Augu&s;t to attack Colonel Baum, and the latter was &s;o far from expecting &s;uch a vi&s;it, that he took him at fir&s;t for the reinforcement he was waiting for: However, he made a very brave defence, but his little works were &s;oon forced on all &s;ides; the Indians and the Engli&s;h provincial troops, had already ran away into the woods, and there remained only the Ger|mans, who, after they had expended all their powder, charged the enemy &s;word in hand, but were finally forced to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war, after &s;eeing their Colonel fall.</P>
<P>A little after this action arrives Colonel Breyman, without knowing any thing of what had pa&s;&s;ed: In&s;tead of friends, he &s;aw him&s;elf &s;uddenly &s;urrounded by American forces; but the fatigued and exhau&s;ted &s;tate of his troops did not prevent him from making a &s;oldierly defence. He even drove the enemy from two or three heights; but was, however, at la&s;t overpowered by numbers; and after firing away all his ammunition, made a retreat with great dif|ficulty, leaving two pieces of artillery in the hands of the enemy. Their lo&s;s in the&s;e two actions, amounted in killed, wounded and mi&s;&s;ing to five or &s;ix hundred men; and in this &s;troke, Fortune now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;ince the death of General Montgomery, &s;howed her&s;elf favourable to the Americans in their expeditions to the north: The militia at length found they <HI>could</HI> conquer regular forces; an opinion of more con&s;equence at this time than the gain|ing of a great battle upon other occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>While Saint Leger was employed, with various &s;ucce&s;s in be|&s;ieging Fort Stanwix, General Harkimer came at the head of nine hundred of the militia of the country to relieve and victual the fort: Upon this Saint Leger, fearing an attack in his entren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hments, fixed an ambu&s;cade, compo&s;ed of regulars and Indians to intercept them. The militia, a thing almo&s;t incredible in a country where this kind of warfare is u&s;ual, fell blindly into it, lo&s;t a con&s;iderable number, and could not be rallied but with the greate&s;t difficulty. The Governor of the fort, Colonel Gan&s;evoort, informed, in the mean time, of what had happened, ha&s;tened to make a diver&s;ion in favour of his friends, penetrated into the Engli&s;h camp, plundered it, carried off a great quantity of &s;uch articles as he was in want of, and made &s;ome pri&s;oners. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Note, this &s;ally was made under the immediate direction of Colonel Willet.</NOTE></P>
<P>Colonel Saint Leger, after his &s;ucce&s;s, neglected nothing to engage the be&s;ieged to &s;urrender. The Governor, however, continued deaf to his menaces, as well as to his promi&s;es and intreaties.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="018167_0073_0FA55F022E4346E8">In the &s;kirmi&s;h with the militia, the Indians did not get the booty they expected; they be&s;ides lo&s;t &s;everal of their warriors, celebrated among them for their bravery, and now learnt with extreme vexation that General Arnold was coming to the relief of the place with a thou&s;and men, and that Burgoyne had met with &s;everal checks, if not totally ruined. Their di&s;content and ill humour was then carried to exce&s;s: notwith&s;tanding all that could be &s;aid or done to calm, and retain the&s;e da&s;tards with the army, they left the camp, after having robbed the officers, pillaged the &s;tores, cut the throats of &s;everal of the &s;oldiers and &s;tolen their arms and provi&s;ions, which in the end forced Colonel Saint Leger to rai&s;e the &s;iege in ha&s;te, and even leave behind a part of his baggage. This la&s;t piece of news completed the joy and confidence of the Americans, while Gan&s;evoort and Willet, who had defended the place, were ranked, as well as General Starke and Colonel Warner, in the number of the Saviours of their country.</P>
<P>Burgoyne, &s;upplying him&s;elf con&s;tantly with provi&s;ions from Fort George, but with great difficulty, pa&s;&s;ed Hud&s;on's River about the middle of September, the enemy being at that time in the vicinity of Stillwater. The Mini&s;try and Parliament have examined whether this march was either nece&s;&s;ary or &s;ea&s;onable, but it has not appeared that any &s;ufficient arguments have been brought again&s;t it: it is evident, that Burgoyne was determined in his mea&s;ures not only by immediate circum&s;tances, but al&s;o by the in&s;tructions of his court. He afterwards advanced through bye-roads and routs little frequented, along the river, on the &s;ame &s;ide with the enemy, and often &s;eparated from them only by thin woods. He marched in per&s;on at the head of the Engli&s;h line, which formed the right wing. This wing was covered by General Frazer, and Colonel Breyman, with the grenadiers and light infantry, Indian e&s;corts, Provincials and Canadians: the left wing and the artil|lery, commanded by Majors Philips, and Reid&s;el, followed the &s;hores of the river.</P>
<P>The Americans now pre&s;ented them&s;elves in force to attack the flank of the Engli&s;h line. The latter were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed, when they &s;aw with what boldne&s;s the enemy began the attack, and with what vigour and ob&s;tinacy they &s;upported it from three in the afternoon till &s;un-&s;et. General Arnold led on his troops, and courted danger with an ardor and intrepidity, which although na|tural to his character, could never have been &s;hown to better ad|vantage: the Americans however were con&s;tantly reinforced with fre&s;h troops, whil&s;t, on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, the weight and burden of the action was almo&s;t continually &s;u&s;tained by the &s;ame per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Major-Gereral Philips, upon hearing the fir&s;t fire, marched with a part of the artillery acro&s;s a piece of woods, very difficult of acce&s;s, and his arrival, in a critical minute, for that time &s;aved the army, who remained ma&s;ters of the field. This victory was honourably gained, but gave them to know, that the Americans
<PB N="74" REF="018167_0074_0FA55F0300372148">
were capable of defending them&s;elves, not only in entrenchments, and behind walls and hedges, but in the open field, uncovered, and for a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time. The Engli&s;h remained under arms the whole night, and at day-break advanced within cannon &s;hot of the enemy, fortifying their wings and extending their left towards the river; but they found the Americans too much upon their guard to be meddled with.</P>
<P>The fatigues the army had undergone, and the di&s;couraging pro&s;pect they had before them, confounded at once all the hopes and expectations with which the Indians, in particular, had flat|tered them&s;elves; it was now impo&s;&s;ible to get any further &s;ervices from them; they became &s;ullen and intractable, and upon the General finding &s;ome fault with their conduct, they abandoned the army and went off in a pet, at a time when it &s;tood mo&s;t in need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This Indian de&s;ertion brought on others among the Engli&s;h, as well as the Provincial and Canadian troops.</P>
<P>Burgoyne had &s;till however, &s;ome hopes of being &s;uccoured by an army from New-York; with much difficulty he received a letter from Sir Henry Clinton in cyphers, informing him that he was about to make a diver&s;ion in his favour upon the North river, by attacking Fort Montgomery and &s;everal other of the neighbour|ing fortre&s;&s;es: Burgoyne by way of an&s;wer, pre&s;&s;ed him for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, gave an account of his &s;ituation, and informed him that his provi&s;ions could not hold out longer than the twelfth of the en&s;uing month.</P>
<P>The army under the command of General Gates, increa&s;ing from day to day, obliged Burgoyue to fortify with the greate&s;t attention, and to add con&s;iderably to the number of guards, which nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;ed the fatigue and weakened the troops: the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the militia had likewi&s;e made them more enterpri&s;ing than before, and tho&s;e of New-Hamp&s;hire and the upper parts of Connecticut, commanded by General Lincoln, recovered Ticon|deroga and Mount Independence, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of lake George, and thus cut off Burgoyne from all communication with Canada.</P>
<P>In the beginning of October this unfortunate General was obliged to dimini&s;h his rations, and then determined, whatever might be the con&s;equence, to force him&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age through the country. For this purpo&s;e he picked out the choice&s;t of his troops, and the brave&s;t and be&s;t experienced of his officers: but the Americans perceiving his de&s;ign, came down by thou&s;ands to attack him. It was then that the Engli&s;h began to &s;ink under the numbers of their enemies; they were forced to retire within their lines, into which General Arnold pur&s;ued them with his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity, and would infallibly have forced them, had he not received a wound.</P>
<P>Colonel Breyman, who commanded a German corps de re&s;erve, was &s;till more unfortunate; his camp was attacked and carried,
<PB N="75" REF="018167_0075_0FA55F03D87765B0">
his baggage pillaged, his cannon taken, and he him&s;elf peri&s;hed in the action. This day the Engli&s;h lo&s;t a part of their brave&s;t men, and nothing could exceed their mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s; they la|boured the whole night to change their po&s;ition, hoping to oblige the enemy to change theirs al&s;o. This bu&s;ine&s;s was accompli&s;hed with incredible &s;ilence and activity, and in the morning they offer|ed battle to the Americans, who declined it; con&s;idering, with good rea&s;on, that it would be better to fatigue and harra&s;s a brave and de&s;perate enemy, than to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the chance of a deci&s;ive action.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h General was now informed, that the enemy had di&s;patched forward a con&s;iderable body, to &s;urround him entirely. This, he took every mea&s;ure in his power to prevent, and upon the night of the ninth of October, began to march, leaving his &s;ick and wounded to provide for them&s;elves; but the care General Gates took of the&s;e has been &s;ince gratefully acknowledged by the Engli&s;h them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A heavy rain, that la&s;ted the whole night, rendered their pro|gre&s;s very &s;low; and at break of day he perceived the Americans po&s;ted and fortified on the heights around him. He then took a re&s;olution to march towards Fort Edward, but his road cutters be|ing repul&s;ed, and the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the river lined with enemies, he concluded to call a council of war; upon con&s;idering the mat|ter, they &s;aw no other probable way of reaching this Fort than by a night march, and the &s;oldiers carrying their provi&s;ions on their backs: But while they were preparing to execute this forlorn pur|po&s;e, they learnt that the enemy had taken &s;ufficient precautions to prevent the execution of their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more wretched&mdash;nothing more de|plorable than the condition of this army. Worn down by a long &s;eries of &s;evere duty, marches and actions; for&s;aken by the Indians in the needful moment, weakened by de&s;ertion, dejected and di&s;|couraged by the timidity of the Canadians and provincial troops, their regular corps reduced by repeated lo&s;&s;es, to the number of on|ly three thou&s;and five hundred, their brave&s;t officers killed, the re&s;t forced to be continually under arms, harra&s;&s;ed day and night, by an enemy that &s;eemed to grow out of the ground on every &s;ide, having lo&s;t all hope of relief, and but three days provi&s;ions left, their la&s;t re&s;ource was to make the be&s;t terms they could with the enemy. The General, willing however, in an affair that regard|ed the future well-being of every individual in the army, to have their unanimous voice, as far as po&s;&s;ible, called a council of war, inviting not only the generals and &s;taff-officers, but all the com|manding captains: the&s;e univer&s;ally gave it as their opinion, <HI>that the army could not do otherwi&s;e than treat with General Gates</HI>; and the Engli&s;h have &s;ince done the latter the ju&s;tice to declare, that, con&s;idering the ground on which he &s;tood, he &s;howed not the lea&s;t mark of in&s;olence or arrogance.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="018167_0076_0FA55F0470D918B0">The &s;ub&s;tance of the principal articles was, that the army &s;hould march out of their camp with the honours of war, and their artil|lery, to an appointed place, where they &s;hould pile their arms: that a pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be granted them from Bo&s;ton to Europe, up|on condition of their not &s;erving in America during the pre&s;ent war.&mdash;They reckoned their lo&s;s from the &s;ixth of July, to the capitulation, inclu&s;ive, to amount to near ten thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The great fault of Burgoyne, and what prepared the way to all his misfortunes, was his march to Fort Edward; if he had return|ed to Ticonderoga, and proceeded to Fort George, he would doubtle&s;s have avoided the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, but, as has been ob&s;erv|ed, he feared that a retrograde movement would &s;lacken the ar|dour of his troops, and give the Americans time to recover from their &s;urpri&s;e. A General is always blameable when he ventures far into unexplored countries; but Burgoyne, who had &s;een the Americans fly, on all &s;ides, at his approach, notwith&s;tanding their &s;uperiority in number, and tho&s;e va&s;t fortifications which both na|ture and art had rendered impregnable, could he believe that the&s;e very men would afterwards dare to &s;how them&s;elves, &s;urround him on every &s;ide, and fight him in the open field?</P>
<P>The &s;hame of re-iterated defeats, the immediate calamities they felt, and greater &s;till to be expected, the dread of Indian cruelty and indi&s;criminate plunder; all the&s;e con&s;iderations mu&s;t have wrought wonderfully on the minds of the Americans to have produced &s;o &s;udden and univer&s;al a change; let it be remembered, however, that the very elements a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the reduction of Burgoyne; the heavy rains threw continual ob&s;tacles in his way, particularly in the affair of Bennington, where, by delaying the march of Colonel Breyman, General Starke had an opportunity of attacking and defeating Colonel Baum, before the other's arrival; the Indians, likewi&s;e, for&s;ook him at the very time when they could be of u&s;e to him; his expected reinforcements never joined him; and Clinton, who then commanded at New-York, and might with the greate&s;t ea&s;e have &s;ailed in force up the North River, was too &s;low in making the diver&s;ion. All that genius, activity and courage could &s;ugge&s;t was put into practice by Burgoyne; his marches were judicious, his po&s;itions advantageous, and his &s;kirmi&s;hes ob&s;tinate: But the Americans, reanimated by hope, and emboldened by de&s;pair, became every day more numerous active and warlike.</P>
<P>As to Lord Cornwallis, he had to contend with enemies better di&s;ciplined and longer inured to war, but he had the advantage or Burgoyne in long experience in America, in a more exact know|ledge of the country, in being better &s;upplyed with provi&s;ions and ammunition and not having to &s;truggle with &s;uch &s;evere weather and impa&s;&s;able tracts of wilderne&s;s: He had al&s;o the mo&s;t perfect confidence of his troops and was become &s;o formidable to the enemy, that General Wa&s;hington was thought to be the only man that could, as &s;uch, be placed in competition with him. Burgoyne had con&s;tantly to do with enemies who were either &s;trongly en|trenched
<PB N="77" REF="018167_0077_0FA55F05DC9AEBF8">
or infinitely more numerous than his own troops. Corn|wallis, on the contrary, at the head of an army of at lea&s;t eight thou&s;and choice troops, and always &s;uperior to his di&s;per&s;ed enemies, yet, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, did not think proper to attack the Marquis de la Fayette, who never had more at any time than two thou&s;and, nor to hinder the landing of three thou&s;and men under the orders of M. de Saint Simon, to prevent th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m from joining the Marquis. If he had marched down upon them at their fir&s;t land|ing he would have found a body of men totally ignorant of the country they were in, their arms and ammunition yet on board the ve&s;&s;els, and not a &s;ingle intrenchment thrown up: &s;uperior to them &s;till, after their junction with the Marquis, and threatened with the approach of the armies of General Wa&s;hington and Count Rochambeau, ought he not to have ha&s;tened, by forced marches, to attack and di&s;per&s;e them, that he might afterwards have it in his power to make head again&s;t the others? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was believed, at fir&s;t, that Cornwallis's army did not con&s;i&s;t of more than four or five thou&s;and men: without this pre&s;umption it would have been highly imprudent in M de Saint Simon to have landed his troops, before the arrival of General Wa&s;hington and Count Rochambeau. But if notwith&s;tanding that, their landing had been attended with all con&s;equences, he would certainly have been liable to &s;evere reprehen&s;ion.</NOTE></P>
<P>But if, after the in&s;tructions of Clinton, and his promi&s;es of &s;peedily relieving him, he neverthele&s;s thought it improper to hazard any attack, how advantageous &s;oever it might promi&s;e to be, he ought at lea&s;t to have done all in his power to retard and prolong the &s;iege; for whatever might have been the relief promi&s;ed by Clinton, contrary winds might have delayed its arrival, and a few days gained would have been of the greate&s;t importance to him. He likewi&s;e knew that Count de Gra&s;&s;e had declared that he could not remain but a &s;hort time in the bay; &s;o that, retarding his departure, would have been deranging his plans, and con&s;e|quently hindering him from &s;erving his country el&s;ewhere: The &s;ea&s;on being, al&s;o, pretty well advanced, the autumnal rains mu&s;t have made the &s;iege very fatiguing to our troops, and perhaps have occa&s;ioned contagious di&s;tempers among them, in a coun|try where the air and water are le&s;s whole&s;ome than more north|ward. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is the more probable, as the lines being very exten&s;ive, in re&s;pect to the number of men, the duty was more con&s;tant. Some &s;oldiers were eleven nights without lying down in their tents, a greater num|ber &s;even or eight, and the re&s;t four or five.</NOTE></P>
<P>The di&s;tance between York and William&s;burg is twelve miles, and this whole interval is covered with very thick woods; it would certainly have been an ea&s;y matter then, for Cornwallis to have made lines of <HI>abbatis</HI> throughout this fore&s;t, and have &s;topped up
<PB N="78" REF="018167_0078_0FA55F06418F6DE8">
the roads from po&s;t to po&s;t; three thou&s;and &s;laves at lea&s;t, which he had taken from the planters, would have rendered this mode of defence &s;till more practicable&mdash;all our military connoi&s;|&s;eurs have given it as their opinion that a few detachmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and &s;ome field pieces, might have retarded the combined army at lea&s;t a month in its approaches to the works at York, and probably would have de&s;troyed us a great number of men. The lands adjoining the town were covered with Indian corn, and by taking it away or burning it, he would have obliged the a&s;&s;ailants to get food for their hor&s;es at a greater di&s;tance, and by that means delayed the tran&s;portation of the artillery, which was landed &s;everal miles from the camp.</P>
<P>Cornwallis thus &s;hut up in York, with artillery badly enough &s;erved, and his works di&s;advantageou&s;ly con&s;tructed, had it not in his power to &s;ally out upon us without ri&s;quing too much, while the be&s;iegers had time to prepare to receive him, and even to cut off his retreat: being thus incapacitated from acting offen|&s;ively, he could no way extricate him&s;elf but by &s;ome de&s;perate attempt.</P>
<P>If he had known how to profit by circum&s;tances, the relief pro|mi&s;ed by Clinton might have &s;aved him, or at lea&s;t made a great diver&s;ion in his favour. The Engli&s;h &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-&s;even or twenty-eight &s;hips of the line, with four thou&s;and land forces on board, appeared before the capes on the 26th of Octo|ber, that is to &s;ay, &s;even days after the &s;urrender. Count de Gra&s;&s;e's fleet, being thirty-&s;ix &s;hips of the line, was then at anchor within the <HI>Hor&s;e-Shoe,</HI> a &s;and bank, over which ve&s;&s;els of war cannot pa&s;s, except through a narrow channel on the ea&s;t &s;ide; the wind blowing at that time right in, compleatly prevented the &s;quadron from getting under way, and con&s;equently could not have hinder|ed Clinton from effecting a landing for his troops. I cannot &s;ay whether it was a fear of bad weather that inclined the Count to make choice of this place, but his over great precaution was, I am &s;ure, an ob&s;tacle to his pur&s;uit of the Engli&s;h, the wind being fa|vourable enough, had the fleet been in any other place.</P>
<P>May we now a&s;k which of the two Engli&s;h Generals has mani|fe&s;ted the be&s;t conduct? For my part I am of opinion, Burgoyne would have &s;ucceeded better in defending York, and that Corn|wallis <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>And yet Cornwallis has received univer&s;al applau&s;e in England, while Burgoyne experienced nothing but &s;atire, contempt and invective.

<P>THIS great and happy event, in which the French have had &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;hare, will &s;oon give a new turn to Ameri|can affairs.

<P>They likewi&s;e addre&s;&s;ed a petition to his maje&s;ty, a memorial to the people of Great Britain, an addre&s;s to the colonies in general, and another to Canada.</P>

In &s;hort they omitted nothing that could di&s;play their attachment and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their &s;overeign, or their love and veneration for their mother country.&mdash;They next tell him, "We have inherited from our ance&s;tors that pa&s;&s;ionate love of liberty, which placed your illu&s;trious family on the throne." They then go on to be&s;eech him by all that is mo&s;t &s;acred, by the intere&s;ts of his kingdom, by his own, by the &s;ecurity and pro&s;perity of the laws, by the happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects, who&s;e father he is, not to &s;uffer &s;uch intimate bonds of affection to be broken a&s;under in expectation of certain events, which, altho' they might po&s;&s;ibly turn out at la&s;t to his wi&s;h, would never compen&s;ate for the inevi|table lo&s;&s;es that would attend them.</P>
<P>In the memorial addre&s;&s;ed to the people of Britain, they bring into view the rights they ought to enjoy as free men, citizens and coloni&s;ts, the &s;mall regard they entertain for the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h mini&s;try, the attachment they had always &s;hown for their mother country, the numerous &s;ervices they had rendered her the la&s;t war, and the taxes with which they were burdened upon her account, and which were fooli&s;hly &s;quandered upon court favourites.

<P>In their addre&s;s to the Canadians, they di&s;cover the greate&s;t caution and di&s;cretion, and make u&s;e of &s;uch arguments as are mo&s;t conformable to the genius and intere&s;ts of that people.

<P>They &s;hew them that, forming a &s;mall people in compari&s;on of their numerous and powerful neighbours, it is their intere&s;t and happine&s;s to have the united colonies for their &s;teady friends, &s;ince nature had joined their re&s;pective countries together by an indi&s;&s;olu|ble connexion, and &s;eparated them alike from their tyrannical oppre&s;&s;ors by exten&s;ive tracts of ocean.

&mdash;They go on to a&s;&s;ure them, that it is the wi&s;h of the colonies to con&s;ider them as allies; and that &s;uch an alliance has been unanimou&s;ly a&s;&s;ented to in their a&s;&s;emblies; that a viola|tion of <HI>their</HI> rights &s;hall be looked upon as an in&s;ult offered to their own, and that they now invited them to accede to a confe|deracy, the object of which was the &s;ecurity of the natural and civil privileges of the members of the community.</P>
<P>This invitation of the general Congre&s;s, and the addre&s;&s;es, containing quite a new political &s;y&s;tem, were revered almo&s;t as much as the Bible among the people, who adhered &s;trictly to the opinions therein contained, in every particular: they flattered them&s;elves that &s;uch petitions and addre&s;&s;es as the&s;e could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ail of bringing about &s;ome favourable changes in England; but when they found that they had no other effect, and were an&s;wered no other way, than by an act prohibiting the exportation of warlike &s;tores from Great Britain to New-England, then it was that pacific mea&s;ures were totally given up;&mdash;bodies of militia were imme|diately formed, regulations for di&s;cipline were made, and means taken to provide arms and ammunition.

Some of the provinces went &s;o far, as to &s;eize upon the ammunition and arms in the public &s;tores; and thus it turned out that the acts of parliament, the &s;everity of which

<P>As long as men live at a di&s;tance from each other, toleration can|not be attended with any ill con&s;equences, becau&s;e in &s;uch a de|tached &s;tate, they are le&s;s liable to cla&s;h in their opinions, and con|&s;equently le&s;s &s;ubject to divi&s;ions.

On the other hand, the nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ity of an intercour&s;e with all nations, renders the Hollander inattentive to the di&s;putes of his &s;ectaries, e&s;pecially when he con&s;iders, that the power of his country, at be&s;t preca|rious, would &s;oon crumble to pieces without their &s;upport. The &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me cau&s;es operate upon the Engli&s;h nation, but not &s;o powerful|ly, becau&s;e they are not &s;o generally commercial; and becau&s;e the people, being of a le&s;s laborious turn, and le&s;s generally &s;pecula|tive than the Dutch, po&s;&s;e&s;s in a greater degree the powers of rea|&s;oning and reflecting, and are more taken up with their doctrinal opinions: &s;o that all the &s;ects in England are &s;o many rivals and enemies to each other, and their churches perpetually re&s;ound with the mo&s;t illiberal and outrageous di&s;&s;ertations and di&s;cour&s;es. This hatred of each other, would often be attended with fatal effects, were it not for the venerable maje&s;ty of the Catholic faith, which is a perpetual terror to their imaginations, and again&s;t which, as a common enemy, they all unite, as well as again&s;t the menacing power of France, which has almo&s;t always kept them and their na|tion &s;ufficiently employed.</P>
<P>But America, who will be always more at peace abroad, and will never be indebted for her greatne&s;s and power to external and mo|mentary cau&s;es, and who will one day include, in her various fer|tile countries, va&s;t numbers of rich, independent, rea&s;oning, cavil|ling citizens, will have more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o fear from the difference of religious opinions. Even now, or very lately, the writings and &s;ermons of their mini&s;ters, were as much calculated to attack and ridicule their rivals, as to edify their hearers; and Philadelphia, the center of tolerancy, has &s;een its &s;ectaries &s;upporting their religious privileges by blows and violence, Different times and circum&s;tances may render &s;uch feuds of the utmo&s;t ill con&s;equence.</P>

world, or grown to what it is, had not its <HI>author</HI> expre&s;&s;ly forbid toleration; and the <HI>chri&s;tian world</HI> has always di&s;countenanced it, except only &s;uch &s;ects as were un&s;ettled, and wavering in their doc|trinal opinions. Philo&s;ophy, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to unite men, and moderate their pa&s;&s;ions, has certainly inclined them in time pa&s;t to civil toleration, but a&s;piring to examine into, and judge of every thing, it at fir&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned &s;peculative, and af|terwards political, intolerancy; becau&s;e the laws cannot be long indifferent in tho&s;e matters, in which the pa&s;&s;ions of men are parti|cularly intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>The happie&s;t government, and which promi&s;es the mo&s;t la&s;ting pro&s;perity, is that which connects all the members of a &s;ociety in the &s;ame faith, and the &s;ame form of wor&s;hip. True policy ought, then, con&s;tantly to endeavour to recall mankind to a unity of faith; but a de&s;ire of attracting foreigners, and the &s;peedy peo|pling of a country, has tempted &s;everal &s;tates to tran&s;gre&s;s this prin|ciple, by opening an a&s;ylum to all religions without exception. Now, if it can be demon&s;trated, that a well circum&s;tanced nation, where they all profe&s;s one faith, doubles its number of inhabitants every twenty years, would it not be more honourable to live in re|ligious harmony, with &s;uch a degree of population, than to be for|ever quarrelling about creeds and tenets, and torn by religious di|vi&s;ions? This would be &s;erving the pre&s;ent age and po&s;terity both at once.</P>
<P>People, whom edicts of toleration invite into a country, thereby undoubtedly acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> tho&s;e rights and privileges, which the legi&s;la|tive authority cannot infringe without inju&s;tice.

<P>The ruler of a country ought to con&s;ider him&s;elf as the father of his &s;ubjects al&s;o; out of a principle of tenderne&s;s, he &s;hould con|&s;tantly aim to &s;trengthen the bands which connect his numerous fa|mily; and can there be a more powerful one than a religion which in&s;pires the &s;ame &s;entiments, pre&s;cribes the &s;ame duties, and pro|mi&s;es the &s;ame rewards? &mdash; How many millions live and die ene|mies to each other, merely on account of diver&s;ity of opinion in religious matters! but the man who feels the influence of true vir|tue and catholici&s;m, who keeps eternity con&s;tantly in view, and pants for a more intimate union with the pure &s;pirit of the Divinity, perceives his affections expanding, and his heart glowing with rap|ture, when he can entertain rational hopes of enjoying the future friend&s;hip of his fellow men on the other &s;ide of the grave, in the regions beyond this tran&s;itory &s;tate of being.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t affecting &s;cenes, and which will do the mo&s;t ho|nour to the world, will be when all nations &s;hall unite in erecting the &s;ame temples for the &s;ervice of the Deity, and tuning the

<P>By acting in a different manner, &s;he re&s;embles a law giver, who di&s;liking the laws of the nation over which he pre&s;ides, &s;hould ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li&s;h them without offering another, and a better &s;y&s;tem of legi&s;lation in their &s;tead; or a phy&s;ician, who &s;hould forbid his patients the u&s;e of food, which perhaps might not be altogether &s;alutary, without once intimating what &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted of a le&s;s noxious quality.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM unable to de&s;cribe to your Excellency, the painful anxi|ety under which I have laboured, &s;ince the reception of the letter you did me the honour to write me of the 23d in&s;tant. The motions of the naval force under your command, which your Ex|cellency &s;ays may po&s;&s;ibly happen, &s;ince the information commu|nicated to you by the Baron de Clozen, obliged me to point out the con&s;equences that may follow; and warmly to urge a per&s;e|verance in the plan agreed upon between us. Permit me, in the fir&s;t place, to repeat to your Excellency, that the attempt upon York, under the protection of your &s;hipping, is as certain of &s;uc|ce&s;s as a &s;uperior force and a &s;uperiority of mea&s;ures can render any military operation; that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> duration of the &s;iege may be exactly a&s;certained; and that the capture of the Briti&s;h army is a matter &s;o important in it&s;elf, and in its con&s;equences, that it mu&s;t greatly tend to bring an end to the war, and put our allied arms in cer|tain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t ine&s;timable advantages.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="018167_0097_0FA5652DB2EDAC88">If your Excellency quits the Bay, an acce&s;s is open to relieve York, of which the enemy will in&s;tantly avail them&s;elves. The con&s;equences of this will be not only the di&s;grace of abandoning a de&s;ign on which are founded the faire&s;t hopes of the allied forces, after a prodigious expence, fatigue and exertions; but the proba|ble di&s;banding of the whole army; for the pre&s;ent &s;eat of war be|ing &s;uch, as ab&s;olutely precludes the u&s;e of waggons, from the great number of large rivers which inter&s;ect the country, there will be a total want of provi&s;ions, unle&s;s this inconvenience is remedied by water carriage. This province has been &s;o exhau&s;ted by the ra|vages of the enemy, and by the &s;upport already given to our forces, that &s;ub&s;i&s;tence mu&s;t be drawn from a di&s;tance, and that can be done only by a fleet &s;uperior in the Bay.</P>
<P>I e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rne&s;tly beg your Excellency would con&s;ider, that if, by moving your fleet from the &s;ituation agreed on, we lo&s;e the pre&s;ent opportunity, we &s;hall never hereafter have it in our power to &s;trike &s;o deci&s;ive a &s;troke, that the Briti&s;h will labour without in ermi&s;&s;ion to fortify a place &s;o u&s;eful to their &s;hipping; and that then the period of an honourable peace will be farther di&s;tant than ever.</P>
<P>The confidence I have in your Excellency's manly &s;pirit and naval talents leaves me no doubt that the con&s;ideration of the con|&s;equences that mu&s;t follow your departure from the Bay will deter|mine you to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means for the good of the common cau&s;e. From the a&s;&s;urances of the mo&s;t expert &s;ailors, I am per&s;uaded that your Excellency may take &s;uch a po&s;ition in the Bay, as to leave nothing to be apprehended from an attempt of the Engli&s;h fleet; that this po&s;ition will at the &s;ame time facilitate the operations of the &s;iege, &s;ecure the tran&s;portation of our provi&s;ions by water, and accelerate our approaches by l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nding our heavy artillery and warlike nece&s;&s;aries to York River almo&s;t clo&s;e to our trenches.</P>
<P>The force &s;aid to have arrived under Admiral Digby, as the news comes from the Briti&s;h them&s;elves, may not only be exagge|rated, but perhaps ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; but &s;uppo&s;ing it to be true, their whole force united cannot be &s;uch as to give them any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in the attacking your fleet. If the po&s;ition for your &s;hips to lie at an anchor, which we agreed upon, has &s;ince appeared impracticable, there is &s;till another mea&s;ure may be adopted; which, though much inferior as to the &s;ecurity and facility it will give to our land operations, may &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll be of advantage to our affairs. The mea&s;ure, I mean, is to crui&s;e off the Bay, &s;o as to keep the Capes always in &s;ight, and to prevent any Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els getting in.</P>
<P>Whatever plan you may adopt, I am to pre&s;s your Excellency to per&s;evere in the &s;cheme &s;o happily concerted between us; but if you &s;hould find in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles in the way, let me ultimately beg of you not to relinqui&s;h the la&s;t mentioned alternative of preventing all ve&s;&s;els from the enemy entering the Bay of Che&s;apeak.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="018167_0098_0FA5652E649A3D40">"The Briti&s;h Admiral may manoeuvre his fleet, and endeavour to draw you from the main object we have in view; but I can never believe, that he will &s;eriou&s;ly wi&s;h to bring on a general ac|tion with a fleet, who&s;e force, I will an&s;wer it, is &s;uperior to the mo&s;t exaggerated accounts we have of theirs. Pa&s;&s;ed experience has taught them not to hazard them&s;elves with equal numbers; and has drawn from them, though unwillingly, the mo&s;t re&s;pect|ful opinions of their enemy.</P>
<P>Permit me to add, that the ab&s;ence of your fleet from the Bay, may fru&s;trate our de&s;ign upon the garri&s;on at York. For in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of matters, Lord Cornwallis might evacuate the place with the lo&s;s of his artillery, baggage, and a few men, &s;a|crifices; which would be highly ju&s;tifiable from the de&s;ire of &s;av|ing the body of the army.</P>
<P>The Marquis de la Fayette, who does me the honor to carry this letter to your Excellency, will explain to you better than any other per&s;on, or than I can do by letter, many particulars of our pre&s;ent po&s;ition. Your Excellency is acquainted with his candour and ta|lents, which entitles him to your confidence. I have ordered him not to pa&s;s the Cape for fear of accident, in ca&s;e you &s;hould be at &s;ea.

<DATE><HI>October</HI> 20, 1781.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the mortification to inform your Excellency, that I have been forced to give up the po&s;ts of York and Glouce&s;ter, and to &s;urrender the troops under my command, by Capitulation, on the 19th in&s;tant, as pri&s;oners of war to the combined forces of America and France.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw this po&s;t in a very favourable light; but when I found I was to be attacked in it in &s;o unprepared a &s;tate, by &s;o powerful an army and artillery, nothing but the hopes of relief would have induced me to attempt its defence; for I would either have endeavoured to e&s;cape to New-York, by rapid marches from the Glouce&s;ter &s;ide, immediately on the arrival of General Wa&s;h|ington's troops at William&s;burg, or I would, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;parity of numbers, have attacked them in the open field, where it might have been ju&s;t po&s;&s;ible that fortune would have favoured the gallantry of the handful of troops under my command: but being a&s;&s;ured by your Excellency's letter, that every po&s;&s;ible means would be tried by the navy and army to relieve us, I could not
<PB N="99" REF="018167_0099_0FA5652F258AB3D8">
think my&s;elf at liberty to venture on either of tho&s;e de&s;perate attempts: therefore after remaining two days in a &s;trong po&s;ition in front of this place, in hopes of being attacked, upon ob&s;erving that the enemy were taking mea&s;ures which could not fail of turning my left flank in a &s;hort time; and receiving, on the &s;econd evening, your letter of the 24th of September, informing me, that the relief would &s;ail about the 5th of October, I withdrew within the works on the night of the 29th of September, hoping, by the labour and firmne&s;s of the &s;oldiers, to protract the defence until you could arrive.</P>
<P>Every thing was to be expected from the &s;pirit of the troops, but every di&s;advantage attended their labour, as the works were to be continued under the enemy's fire, and our &s;tock of intrenching tools, which did not much exceed 400 when we began to work in the latter end of Augu&s;t, was now much dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The enemy broke ground on the night of the 30th and con|&s;tructed, on that night and the two following days and nights, two redoubts, which, with &s;ome works that had belonged to our outward po&s;ition, occupied a gorge between two creeks or ravines, which c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me from the river on each &s;ide of the town. On the night of the 6th of October, they made their fir&s;t parallel, extending from its right on the river to a deep ravine on the left, nearly oppo&s;ite to the centre of this place, and embracing our whole left, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix hundred yards. Having perfected this parallel, their bat|teries opened on the evening of the 9th again&s;t our left; and other batteries fired at the &s;ame time again&s;t a redoubt advanced over the creek upon our right and defended by about 120 men of the 23d regiment and marines, who maintained that po&s;t with uncom|mon gallantry. The fire continued ince&s;&s;ant from heavy cannon, and from mortars and howitzers throwing &s;hells from &s;ix to &s;ixteen inches, until all our guns on the left were &s;ilenced, our works much damaged, and our lo&s;s of men con&s;iderable. On the night of the 11th they began their &s;econd parallel, about three hundred yards nearer to us. The troops being much weakened by &s;ickne&s;s, as well as by the fire of the be&s;iegers, and ob&s;erving that the enemy had not only &s;ecured their flank, but proceeded in every re&s;pect with the utmo&s;t regularity and caution, I could not venture &s;o large &s;orties as to hope from them any con&s;iderable effect; but otherwi&s;e I did every thing in my power to interrupt this work, by opening new embrazures for guns, and keeping up a con&s;tant fire with all the howitzers and &s;mall mortars that we could man. On the evening of the 14th they a&s;&s;aulted and carryed two redoubts that had been advanced about three hundr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d yards, for the purpo&s;e of delaying their approaches, and coveri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g our left flank, and during the night included them in their &s;econd parallel, on which they continued to work with the utmo&s;t exer&s;ion. Being perfectly &s;en&s;ible that our works could not &s;tand many hours after the opening of the batteries of that parallel, we not only continued a con&s;tant fire with all our mortars, and every gun that could be
<PB N="100" REF="018167_0100_0FA5652FE8E0D030">
brought to bear upon it; but, a little before day-break, on the morning of the 16th, I ordered a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of about three hundred and fifty men, under the direction of Lieutenant-Colonel Abercromby, to attack two batteries which appeared to be in the greate&s;t for|wardne&s;s, and to &s;pike the guns. A detachment of guards, with the 80th company of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enadiers&punc; under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Lake attacked the one; and one of light infantry, under the command of Major Arm&s;trong, attack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the other; and both &s;ucceeded, by forcing the redoubts that covered t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em; &s;piking eleven guns, and killing or wounding about one hundred of the French troops who had the guard of that part of the trenches, and with little lo&s;s on our &s;ide. This action, though extremely honourable to the officers and &s;oldiers who executed it, proved of little public advantage; for the cannon having been &s;piked in a hurry, were &s;oon rendered fit for &s;ervice again, and bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re dark the whole parallel and batteries appeared to be nearly complete. At this time we knew that there was no part of the whole front attacked, in which we could &s;hew a &s;ingle gun, and our &s;hells were nearly expended. I had therefore only to choo&s;e between prepar|ing to &s;urrender next day, or endeavouring to get off with the greate&s;t part of the troops; and I determined to attempt the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter, reflecting, that though it &s;hould prove un&s;ucce&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful in its immediate object, it might at lea&s;t delay the enemy in the pro&s;ecution of further enterpri&s;es. Sixteen large boats were prepared, and upon other pretexts were ordered to be in readine&s;s to receive troops preci&s;ely at ten o'clock; with the&s;e I hoped to pa&s;s the infantry during the night, abandoning our baggage and leaving a detach|ment to capitulate for the town's people and for the &s;ick and wounded; on which &s;ubject a letter was ready to be delivered to General Wa&s;hington. After making my arrangements with the utmo&s;t &s;ecre&s;y, the light infantry, the greate&s;t part of the guards, and part of the 23d regiment, embarked at the hour appointed, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of them landed at Glouce&s;ter; but at this critical moment, the weather, from being moderate and calm, changed to a mo&s;t violent &s;torm of wind and rain, and drove all the boats &s;ome of which had troops on board, down the river. It wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;oon evident that the intended pa&s;&s;age was impracticable, and that the ab&s;ence of the boats rendered it equally impo&s;&s;ible to bring back the troops which had pa&s;&s;ed, which I had ordered about two o'clock in the morning. In this &s;ituation, with my little force divided, the enemy's batteries opened at day-break. The pa&s;&s;age between this place and Glouce&s;ter was much expo&s;ed; but the boats having now returned, they were ordered to bring back the troops which had pa&s;&s;ed during the night, and they joined us in the forenoon, without much lo&s;s. Our works in the mean time were going to ruin; and not having been able to &s;trengthen them by abbatis, nor in any other manner than by a &s;light fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing, which the enemy's artillery were demoli&s;hing wherever they fired, my opinion entirely coincided with that of the engineer and principal officers

of the army, that they were in many parts a&s;&s;ailable in the forenoon, and that by the continuance of the &s;ame fire for a few hours longer, they would be in &s;uch a &s;tate as to render it de&s;perate with our numbers to attempt to maintain them. We at that time could not fire a &s;ingle gun; only one eight inch mortar and little more than one hundred cohorn &s;hells remained: a diver&s;ion of the French &s;hips of war that lay at the mouth of the North river was to be expected; our numbers had been dimini&s;hed by the enemy's fire, but par|ticul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rly by &s;ickne&s;s; and the &s;trength and &s;pirits of tho&s;e in the works were much exhau&s;ted by the fatigue of con&s;tant watching and unremi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting duty. Under all the&s;e circum&s;tances, I thought it would be wanton and inhuman to the la&s;t degree to &s;acrifice the lives of this &s;mall body of gallant &s;oldiers, who had ever behaved with &s;o much fidelity and courage, by expo&s;ing them to an a&s;&s;ault, which, from the numbers and precautions of the enemy, could not fail to &s;ucceed. I therefore propo&s;ed to capitulate. The treat|ment in general that we have received from the enemy, &s;ince our &s;urrender, has been perfectly good and proper; but the kindne&s;s and attention that has been &s;hown to us by the French officers in particular, their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">licate &s;en&s;ibility of our &s;ituation, their generous and pre&s;&s;ing offers of money, both public and private, to any amount, has really gone beyond what I can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;cribe, and will, I hope make an impre&s;&s;ion on the brea&s;t of every Briti&s;h officer, whenever the fortune of war &s;hould put any of them into our power.</P>
<P>Although the event has been &s;o unfortunate, the patience of the &s;oldiers in bearing the greate&s;t fatigues, and their firmne&s;s and in rapidity under a per&s;evering fire of &s;hot and &s;hells that I believe has not often been exceeded, de&s;erves the highe&s;t commendation and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;ucce&s;sful defence in our &s;ituation was perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, for the place could only be reckoned an intrenched camp, &s;ubject in mo&s;t places to enfilade, and the ground in general &s;o di&s;advan|tageous, that nothing but the nece&s;&s;ity of fortifying it as a po&s;t to protect the navy could have induced any per&s;on to erect works upon it; our force daily dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s, and other lo&s;&s;es, and was reduced, when we offered to capitulate, on this &s;ide, to little more than 3,200 rank and file fit for duty, including officers, &s;er|vants, and artificers; and at Glouce&s;ter about 600, including cavalry. The enemy's army con&s;i&s;ted of upwards of 8000 French, nearly as many continentals, and 5000 militia. They brought an immen&s;e train of heavy artillery, mo&s;t amply furni&s;hed with ammunition, and perfectly well manned.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE great object for which I had the honour to hold an ap|pointment in the &s;ervice of my country being accompli&s;hed, I am now preparing to re&s;ign it into the hands of Congre&s;s, and to return to that dome&s;tic retirement, which it is well known, I left with the greate&s;t reluctance&mdash;a retirement for which I have never cea&s;ed to &s;igh, through a long and painful ab&s;ence, and in which (remote from the noi&s;e and trouble of the world) I meditate to pa&s;s the remainder of life in a &s;tate of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e: but before I carry this re&s;olution into effect, I think it a duty incumbent on me, to make this my la&s;t official communication&mdash;to congratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven has been plea&s;ed to pro|duce in our favour: to offer my &s;entiments re&s;pecting &s;ome impor|tant &s;ubjects, which appear to me to be intimately connected with the tranquillity of the United States; to take my leave of your Ex|cellency as a public character; and to give my final ble&s;&s;ing to that country in who&s;e &s;ervice I have &s;pent the prime of my life; for who&s;e &s;ake I have con&s;umed &s;o many anxious days and watchful nights; and who&s;e happine&s;s being extremely dear to me, will always con&s;titute no incon&s;iderable part of my own.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the livelie&s;t &s;en&s;ibility on this plea&s;ing occa&s;ion, I will claim the indulgence of dilating the more copiou&s;ly on the &s;ub|ject of our mutual felicitation. When we con&s;ider the magnitude of the prize we contended for, the doubtful nature of the conte&s;t, and the favourable manner in which it has terminated, we &s;hall find the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on for gratitude and rejoicing: this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a theme that will afford infinite delight to every benevolent and liberal mind, whether the event in contemplation be con&s;idered as the &s;ource of pre&s;ent enjoyment, or the parent of future happine&s;s; and we &s;hall have equal occa&s;ion to felicitate our&s;elves on the lot which Providence has a&s;&s;igned us whether we view it in a natural, a political, or moral point of light.</P>
<P>The citizens of America, placed in the mo&s;t enviable condition, as the &s;ole lords and proprietors of a va&s;t tract of continent, com|prehending all the various &s;oils and climates of the world, and abounding with all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, are now, by the late &s;atisfactory pacification, acknowledged to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of ab&s;olute freedom and independency: they are from this

Here they are not only &s;ur|rounded with every thing which can contribute to the completion of private and dome&s;tic enjoyment, but Heaven has crowned all its other ble&s;&s;ings, by giving a fairer opportunity for political happi|ne&s;s, than any other nation has ever been favoured with. Nothing can illu&s;trate the&s;e ob&s;ervations more forcibly, than a recollection of the happy conjuncture of times and circum&s;tances under which our republic a&s;&s;umed its rank among the nations. The foundation of our empire was not laid in the gloomy age of ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition, but at an epocha when the rights of mankind were bet|ter under&s;tood and more clearly defined than at any former period; the re&s;earches of the human mind after &s;ocial happine&s;s have been carried to a great extent; the trea&s;ures of knowledge, acquired by the labours of philo&s;ophers, &s;ages and legi&s;lators, through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, are laid open for our u&s;e, and their collected wi&s;dom may be happily applied in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our forms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> government; the free cultivation of letters, the unbounded ex|ten&s;ion of commerce, the progre&s;&s;ive refinement of manners, the growing liberality of &s;entiment, and above all, the pure and be|nign light of revelation, have had a meliorating influence on man|kind, and encrea&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. At this au&s;picious period, the United States came into exi&s;tence as a nation, and if their citizens &s;hould not be compleatly free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.</P>
<P>Such is our &s;ituation, and &s;uch our are pro&s;pects; but notwith&s;tand|ing the cup of ble&s;&s;ing is thus reached out to us: notwith&s;tanding happine&s;s is ours if we have a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eize the occa&s;ion and make it our own; yet it appears to me, there is an option &s;till left to the United States of America, that it is in their choice, and depends upon their conduct, whether they will be re&s;pectable and pro&s;perous, or contemptible and mi&s;erable as a nation, This is the time of their political probation: this is the moment when the eyes of the whole world are turned upon them: this is the moment to e&s;tabli&s;h or ruin their national character forever: this is the fa|vourable moment to give &s;uch a tone to our foederal government, as will enable it to an&s;wer the ends of its in&s;titution; or this may be the ill-fated moment for relaxing the powers of the union, an|nihilating the cement of the confederation, and expo&s;ing us to be|come the &s;port of European politics, which may play one &s;tate again&s;t another to prevent their growing importance, and to &s;erve their own intere&s;ted purpo&s;es&punc; for, according to the &s;y&s;tem of poli|cy the &s;tates &s;hall adopt at this moment, they will &s;tand or fall; and by their confirmation or lap&s;e it is yet to be decided, whether the revolution mu&s;t ultimately be con&s;idered as a ble&s;&s;ing or a cur&s;e &mdash;a ble&s;&s;ing or a cur&s;e, not to the pre&s;ent age alone, for with our fate will the de&s;tiny of unborn millions be involved.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="018167_0104_0FA565332F3D5688">With this conviction of the importance of the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, &s;ilence in me would be a crime; I will therefore &s;peak to your Excellency the language of freedom and of &s;incerity without di&s;gui&s;e; I am aware, however, that tho&s;e who differ from me in political &s;enti|ment may perhaps remark, I am &s;tepping out of the proper line of my duty, and they may po&s;&s;ibly a&s;cribe to arrogance or o&s;tentation, what I know is alone the re&s;ult of the pure&s;t intention; but the rectitude of my own heart, which di&s;dains &s;uch unworthy motives, the part I have hitherto acted in life, the determination I have formed of not taking any &s;hare in public bu&s;ine&s;s hereafter, the ardent de&s;ire I feel, and &s;hall continue to manife&s;t, of quietly en|joying in private life, after all the toils of war, the benefits of a wi&s;e and liberal government, will, I flatter my&s;elf, &s;ooner or later, convince my countrymen, that I could have no &s;ini&s;ter views in de|livering, with &s;o little re&s;erve, the opinions contained in this ad|dre&s;s.</P>
<P>There are four things which I humbly conceive are e&s;&s;ential to the well being, I may even venture to &s;ay, to the exi&s;tence of the United States as an independent power.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. An indi&s;&s;oluble union of the &s;tates under one foederal head.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. A &s;acred regard to public ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The adoption of a proper peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. And,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly di&s;po&s;ition among the people of the United States, which will induce them to forget their local prejudices and policies, to make tho&s;e mutual con|ce&s;&s;ions which are requi&s;ite to the general pro&s;perity, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, to &s;acrifice their individual advantages to the intere&s;ts of the community.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the pillars on which the glorious fabric of our inde|pendency and national character mu&s;t be &s;upported: liberty is the ba&s;is; and whoever would dare to &s;ap the foundation or overturn the &s;tructure, under whatever &s;pecious pretexts he may a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will merit the bittere&s;t execrations and the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment which can be inflicted by his injured country.</P>
<P>On the three fir&s;t articles I will make a few ob&s;ervations, leaving the la&s;t to the good &s;en&s;e and &s;erious con&s;ideration of tho&s;e imme|diately concerned.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t head, although it may not be nece&s;&s;ary or pro|per for me in this place to enter into a particular di&s;qui&s;ition of the principles of the union, and to take up the great que&s;tion which has been frequently agitated, whether it be expedient and requi&s;ite for the &s;tates to delegate a larger proportion of power to Congre&s;s, or not&mdash; yet it will be a part of my duty and that of every true patriot, to a&s;&s;ert without re&s;erve, and to in&s;i&s;t upon the following po&s;itions: that unle&s;s the &s;tates will &s;uffer Congre&s;s to exerci&s;e tho&s;e prerogatives they are undoubtedly inve&s;ted with by the con&s;titution, every thing mu&s;t very rapidly tend to anarchy and confu&s;ion: that it is indi&s;pen&s;ible to the happine&s;s of the in|dividual &s;tates, that there &s;hould be lodged &s;omewhere, a &s;upreme

power, to regulate and govern the general concerns of the confe|derated republic, without which the union cannot be of long dura|tion; that there mu&s;t be a faithful and pointed compliance on the part of every &s;tate, with the late propo&s;als and demands of Congre&s;s, or the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences will en&s;ue; that whatever mea&s;ures have a tendency to di&s;&s;olve the union, or contribute to violate or le&s;&s;en the &s;overeign authority, ought to be con&s;idered as ho&s;tile to the liberty and independency of America, and the authors of them treated accordingly; and la&s;tly, that unle&s;s we can be enabled, by the concurrence of the &s;tates, to participate of the fruits of the re|volution, and enjoy the e&s;&s;ential benefits of civil &s;ociety, under a form of government &s;o free and uncorrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, &s;o happily guarded again&s;t the danger of oppre&s;&s;ion, as has been devi&s;ed and adopted by the articles of confederation; that it will be a &s;ubject of regret that &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure have been lavi&s;hed for no purpo&s;e, that &s;o many &s;ufferings have been encountered without a compen|&s;ation, and that &s;o many &s;acrifices have been made in vain. Many other con&s;iderations might here be adduced to prove, that without an entire conformity to the &s;pirit of the union, we cannot exi&s;t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an independent power&mdash;it will be &s;ufficient for my pur|po&s;e to mention but one or two which &s;eem to me of the greate&s;t importance: It is only in our united character as an empire, that our independence is acknowledged, that our power can be regard|ed, or our credit &s;upported among foreign nations. The treaties of the European powers with the United States of America, will have no validity on a di&s;&s;olution of the union &mdash;we &s;hall be left nearly in a &s;tate of nature; or we may find by our own unhappy experience, that there is a natural and nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;&s;ion from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of tyranny, and that arbi|trary power is mo&s;t ea&s;ily e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ruins of liberty abu&s;ed to licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd article which re&s;pects the performance of public ju&s;tice, Congre&s;s have, in their late addre&s;s to the United States almo&s;t exhau&s;ted the &s;ubject; they have explained their ideas &s;o fully, and have enforced the obligations the &s;tates are un|der to render compleat ju&s;tice to all the public creditors, with &s;o much dignity and energy, that in my opinion no real friend to the honour and independency of America, can he&s;itate a &s;ingle mo|ment re&s;pecting the propriety of complying with the ju&s;t and honourable mea&s;ures propo&s;ed: if their arguments do not produce conviction, I know of nothing that will have greater influence; e&s;pecially when we recollect, that the &s;y&s;tem referred to, being the re&s;ult of the collected wi&s;dom of the continent, mu&s;t be e&s;teemed if not perfect, certainly the lea&s;t objectionable of any that could be devi&s;ed, and that if it &s;hall not be carried into immediate execution, a national bankruptcy, with all its deplorable con&s;equences, will take place before any different plan can po&s;&s;ibly be propo&s;ed and adopted. So pre&s;&s;ing are the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances! and &s;uch is the alter|native now offered to the &s;tates!</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="018167_0106_0FA5653522E48690">The ability of the country to di&s;charge the debts which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be doubted&mdash; an inclination, I flatter my&s;elf, will not be wanting; the path of our duty is plain before us: hone&s;ty will be found, on every experiment, to be the be&s;t and only true policy; let us, then, as a nation, be ju&s;t; let us fulfil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the public contracts, which Congre&s;s had undoubtedly a right to make for the purpo&s;e of carrying on the war, with the &s;ame good faith we &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves bound to perform our private en|gagements: in the mean time let an attention to the chearful per|formance of their proper bu&s;ine&s;s as individuals and as members of &s;ociety, be earne&s;tly inculcated on the citizens of America; then will they &s;trengthen the hands of government, and be happy under its protection; every one will reap the fruit of his labours; every one will enjoy his own acqui&s;itions without mole&s;tation and with|out danger.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of ab&s;olute freedom and perfect &s;ecurity, who will grudge to yield a very little of his property, to &s;upport the com|mon intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and en&s;ure the protection of government? Who does not remember the frequent declarations at the commence|ment of the war, that we &s;hould be compleatly &s;atisfied, if at the expence of one half we could defend the remainder of our po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions? Where is the man to be found who wi&s;hes to remain in|debted for the defence of his own per&s;on and property, to the ex|ertions, the bravery, and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to repay the debt of honor and of gratitude? In what part of the continent &s;hall we find any man, or body of men, who would not blu&s;h to &s;tand up and propo&s;e mea&s;ures purpo&s;ely calculated to rob the &s;oldier of his &s;tipend, and the public creditor of his due? And were it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a flagrant in&s;tance of inju&s;tice could ever happen, would it not excite the general indig|nation, and tend to bring down upon the authors of &s;uch mea&s;ures, the aggravated vengeance of Heaven? If after all, a &s;pirit of di&s;|union or a temper of ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s &s;hould manife&s;t it|&s;elf in any of the &s;tates; if &s;uch an ungracious di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould attempt to fru&s;trate all the happy effects that might be expected to flow from the union: if there &s;hould be a refu&s;al to comply with the requi&s;itions for funds to di&s;charge the annual intere&s;t of the pub|lic debts; and if that refu&s;al &s;hould revive again all tho&s;e jealou&s;ies, and produce all tho&s;e evils which are now happily removed. Con|gre&s;s, who have in all their tran&s;actions &s;hewn a great degree of magnanimity and ju&s;tice, will &s;tand ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God and man: and the &s;tate alone which puts it&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to the aggregate wi&s;dom of the continent, and follows &s;uch mi&s;taken and pernicious councils, will be re&s;pon&s;ible for all the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>For my own part, con&s;cious of having acted, while a &s;ervant of the public, in the manner I conceived be&s;t &s;uited to promote the real intere&s;t of my country: having in con&s;equence of my fixed belief, in &s;ome mea&s;ure pledged my&s;elf to the army, that their country would finally do them compleat and ample ju&s;tice; and
<PB N="107" REF="018167_0107_0FA5653788716850">
not wi&s;hing to conceal any in&s;tance of my official conduct from the eyes of the world, I have thought proper to tran&s;mit to your Excel|lency the enclo&s;ed collection of papers, relative to the half pay and commutation granted by Congre&s;s to the officers of the army; from the&s;e commutations, my decided &s;entiments will be clearly com|prehended, together with the conclu&s;ive rea&s;ons which induced me, at an early period, to recommend the adoption of this mea&s;ure in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and &s;erious manner. As the proceedings of Con|gre&s;s, the army and my&s;elf, are open to all, and contain, in my opinion, &s;ufficient information to remove the prejudices and errors which may have been entertained by any, I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing more, than ju&s;t to ob&s;erve that the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s now alluded to, are undoubtedly as ab&s;olutely binding up|on the United States as the mo&s;t &s;olemn acts of confederation or legi&s;lation. As to the idea, which I am informed has in &s;ome in|&s;tances prevailed, that the half-pay and commutation are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a pen&s;ion; it ought to be exploded forever&mdash;that provi&s;ion &s;hould be viewed, as it really was, a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation offered by Congre&s;s, at a time when they had nothing el&s;e to give, to the officer of the army for &s;ervices then to be performed&mdash;it was the only means to prevent a total dereliction of the &s;ervice; it was a part of their hire, I may be allowed to &s;ay, it was the price of their blood and of your inde|pendency; it is therefore more than a common debt; it is a debt of honor; it can never be con&s;idered as a pen&s;ion or gratuity, nor be cancelled until it is fairly di&s;charged.</P>
<P>With regard to a di&s;tinction between officers and &s;oldiers, it is &s;ufficient that the uniform experience of every nation of the world, combined with our own, proves the utility and propriety of the di&s;crimination: rewards in proportion to the aids the public de|rives from them, are unque&s;tionably due to all its &s;ervants. In &s;ome lines, the &s;oldiers perhaps have generally had as ample a compen|&s;ation for their &s;ervices, by the large bounties which have been paid to them, as their officers will receive in the propo&s;ed commutation: in others, if be&s;ides the donation of lands, the payment of arrear|ages of cloathing and wages (in which articles all the component parts of the army mu&s;t be put upon the &s;ame footing) we take into the e&s;timate the bounties many of the &s;oldiers have received and the gratuity of one year's full pay, which is promi&s;ed to all, po&s;&s;ibly their &s;ituation (every circum&s;tance being duly con&s;idered) will not be deemed le&s;s eligible than that of the officers; &s;hould a farther reward, however be judged equitable, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, no one will enjoy greater &s;atisfaction than my&s;elf, on &s;eeing an ex|emption from taxes for a limited time (which has been petitioned for in &s;ome in&s;tances) or any other adequate immunity or compen|&s;ation, granted to the brave defenders of their country's cau&s;e: but neither the adoption or rejection of this propo&s;ition will in any manner affect, much le&s;s militate again&s;t the act of Congre&s;s, by
<PB N="108" REF="018167_0108_0FA56539122CC948">
which they have offered five years full pay, in lieu of the half-pay for life, which had been before promi&s;ed to the officers of the army.</P>
<P>Before I conclude the &s;ubject of public ju&s;tice, I cannot omit to mention the obligations this country is under to that meritorious cla&s;s of veteran non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers and privates who have been di&s;charged for inability, in con&s;equence of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the 23d of April 1782, on annual pen&s;ion for life; their peculiar &s;ufferings, their &s;ingular merits and claims to that provi&s;ion, need only be known, to intere&s;t all the feelings of hu|manity in their behalf&mdash; nothing but a punctual payment of their annual allowance can re&s;cue them from the mo&s;t complicated mi|&s;ery&mdash;and nothing could be a more melancholy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fight, than to behold tho&s;e who have &s;hed their blood or lo&s;t their limbs in the &s;ervice of their country, without a &s;helter, without a friend, and without the means of obtaining any of the nece&s;&s;aries or com|forts of life, compelled to beg their daily bread from door to door! Suffer me to recommend tho&s;e of this de&s;cription, belonging to your &s;tate, to the warme&s;t patronage of your excellency and your legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay but a few words on the third topic which was propo&s;ed, and which regards particularly the defence of the republic: as there can be little doubt but Congre&s;s will recommend a proper peace e&s;tabli&s;hment for the United-States, in which a due attention will be paid to the importance of placing the militia of the union upon a regular and re&s;pectable footing&mdash;if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I would beg leave to urge the great advantage of it in the &s;tronge&s;t terms: The militia of this country mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the palladium of our &s;ecurity and the fir&s;t effectual re&s;ort in ca&s;e of ho&s;tility&mdash;it is e&s;&s;ential, therefore, that the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem &s;hould pervade the whole; that the formation and di&s;cipline of the militia of the continent &s;hould be ab&s;olutely uniform, and that the &s;ame &s;pecies of arms, accoutrements and military apparatus, &s;hould be introduced in every part of the United-States: No one who has not learnt it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expence and confu&s;ion which re&s;ult from a contrary &s;y&s;tem, or the vague arrangements which have hitherto prevailed.</P>
<P>If in treating of political points, a greater latitude than u&s;ual has been taken in the cour&s;e of this addre&s;s, the importance of the cri&s;is and the magnitude of the objects in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be my apology: It is, however, neither my wi&s;h or expectation that the preceding ob&s;ervations &s;hould claim any regard, except &s;o far as they &s;hall appear to be dictated by a good intention, con&s;onant to the immutable rules of ju&s;tice, calculated to produce a liberal &s;y&s;tem of policy, and founded on whatever experience may have been acquired by a long and clo&s;e attention to public bu&s;ine&s;s: here I might &s;peak with the more confidence from my actual ob&s;ervations, and if it would not &s;well this letter (already too prolix) beyond the bounds I had pre&s;cribed my&s;elf, I could demon&s;trate to every mind open to conviction, that in le&s;s time, and with much

le&s;s expence than has been incurred, the war might have been brought to the &s;ame happy conclu&s;ion, if the re&s;ources of the continent could have been properly brought forth; that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments which have very often occurred, have, in too many in&s;tance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, re&s;ulted more from a want of energy in the con|tinental government, than a deficiency of means in the particular &s;tates; that the inefficacy of mea&s;ures ari&s;ing from the want of an adequate authority in the Supreme Power, from a partial com|pliance with the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s in &s;ome of the &s;tates, and from a failure of punctuality in others, while it tended to damp the zeal of tho&s;e which were more willing to exert them&s;elves, &s;erved al&s;o to accumulate the expences of the war, and to fru&s;trate the be&s;t concerted plans; and that the di&s;couragement occa&s;ioned by the complicated difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments, in which our affairs were by this means involved, would have long ago produced the di&s;&s;olution of any army, le&s;s patient, le&s;s virtuous, and le&s;s per|&s;evering than that which I have had the honor to command: But while I mention the&s;e things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our foederal con&s;titution, particularly in the pro&s;ecution of a war, I beg it may be under&s;tood, that as I have ever taken a plea&s;ure in gratefully acknowledging the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport I have derived from every cla&s;s of citizens, &s;o &s;hall I always be hap|py to do ju&s;tice to the unparalleled exertions of the individual &s;tates on many intere&s;ting occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I have thus freely di&s;clo&s;ed what I wi&s;hed to make known be|fore I &s;urrendered up my public tru&s;t to tho&s;e who committed it to me. The ta&s;k is now accompli&s;hed. I now bid adieu to your Excellency as the chief magi&s;trate of your &s;tate; at the &s;ame time I bid a la&s;t farewell to the cares of office and all the employments of public life. It remains then to be my final and only reque&s;t, that your Excellency will communicate the&s;e &s;entiments to your legi&s;lature at their next meeting, and that they may be con&s;idered as the legacy of one who has ardently wi&s;hed, on all occa&s;ions, to be u&s;eful to his country, and who, even in the &s;hade of retirement, will not fail to implore the divine benediction upon it.</P>
<P>I now make it my earne&s;t prayer, that God would have you, and the &s;tate over which you pre&s;ide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a &s;pirit of &s;ub|ordination and obedience to government; to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow citizens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren who have &s;erved in the field; and finally, that he would mo&s;t graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e us all, to do ju&s;tice, to love mercy, and to de|mean our&s;elves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteri&s;tics of the divine author of our ble&s;&s;ed religion, and without an humble imitation of who&s;e exam|ple in the&s;e things, we can never hope to be a happy nation.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides the general rea&s;ons for Great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">Britain coming &s;o unex|pectedly to a treaty of pacification, the failure of the harve&s;t, which threatened a famine, is particularly urged, as perhaps nothing but the &s;upply of grain which the peace may enable us to draw from America could effectually prevent that awful event. Peace would have been worthily obtained by the ce&s;&s;ion of Gibraltar; it would have been &s;aving an immen&s;e expence, and that too for an object now become in&s;ignificant&mdash;our Mediterranean trade. Yet the mini&s;try are entitled to commendation for wi&s;ely yielding to the voice of the people in retaining it, whether that voice was judicious or not. Weakened, humbled, and on the brink of ruin, &s;afety, not glory, was the principal object by which our &s;tate&s;men were to be directed. The treaty with America is ju&s;t and liberal. The Americans had it in contemplation to compo&s;e a book of all their &s;ufferings, and to make it a &s;chool book for their children, and &s;uch an in&s;titution would have continued an evil &s;pirit for ages; but &s;ince the acknowledgement of Independency, and the peace, the de&s;ign has been laid a&s;ide. Granting them Indepen|dency was nothing more than what in fact they had already obtained.</P>
<P>As to the limits, they are the only ones that could have been cho&s;en without giving afterward occa&s;ion to much di&s;order and contention. The Canada furr trade will be in part affected, but that object was not &s;o great as to merit a continuance of the war, and as to retaining the &s;orts &s;outh of the Briti&s;h boundaries, &s;uch a treaty would have proved not &s;o much a termination of the old, as the beginning of a new war.</P>

<P>Concerning the Canada boundaries, government had two views; one political, a permanent peace; to obtain which, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to prevent every ground of future jealou&s;y; the other view was commercial; monopolies begin to be exploded, and to have contended about a few furrs, would have been incompatible with a de&s;ign of &s;uch a magnitude and importance, as an enlarged plan of commerce.&mdash;And with regard to the fi&s;hery, if a &s;hare had not been granted the Americans, they would have &s;tolen in upon us, in &s;pite of all our endeavours, and we &s;hould have been in|volved in endle&s;s altercations with them.</P>
