<P>Then Father, if you plea&s;e to hear me, It is clear and evi|dent, &s;ince Miracles are no where to be found, if the Scripture be not our Rule, or of Divine Au|thority, God has left us no cer|tain Rule at all; and that infinite Wi&s;dom &s;hould deal thus with Mankind, is ab&s;urd and unrea&s;on|able to conceive. But I have one Argument more: If the Scrip|tures be not the Invention of Men, then it mu&s;t be from God alone: If of Men, they mu&s;t either be good Men or bad Men. Good Men they could not be; for no|thing could be more oppo&s;ite to Goodne&s;s, nay to common Hone|&s;ty, than to a&s;&s;ume the Name of God, and fal&s;ly feign Miracles, and cheat People of their Souls. Again, on the other hand, bad Men could not be the Devi&s;ers of &s;o holy a Book; can any Man think, that wicked Deceivers

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Prayer is the pouring forth of the De&s;ires of the Soul to Almighty God, or an hum|ble asking of God &s;uch things as we need, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.15.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What Rule hath God given to direct his People in Prayer?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The whole <HI>Word of God</HI> is of u&s;e to direct us in <HI>Prayer,</HI> but the &s;pecial Rule is that form of Prayer which Je&s;us Chri&s;t taught his Di&s;|ciples, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.6.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>May all Per&s;ons (Sinners as well as Saints) u&s;e tho&s;e words, or pray &s;o as Chri&s;t taught his Di&s;ciples?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> No verily, Ungodly and Sinners ought not &s;o to Pray.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>Why &s;o?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Becau&s;e they cannot go to God as to a Father, they may Pray
<PB N="105" REF="039314_0114_1013FD77D6398F58">
to him as to a Merciful Creator; but not as to a Father, becau&s;e they are not his Children; al&s;o, they cannot Pray, <HI>Forgive us our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive them that Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us,</HI> becau&s;e many of them do not forgive &s;uch who Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Qu&middot; <HI>Mu&s;t Children Pray to God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yea, they and all others by all means ought to pray, for Prayer is a Branch of Natural Religion.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>Ought Parents to Teach their Children a form of Prayer?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Parents ought to give Di|rections to their <HI>Children</HI> how they &s;hould Pray, and what they &s;hould Pray for, &amp; exhort them to Pray; but we do not read in Scripture, that any of Gods Servants taught their Children a form of Prayer.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>What kind of Directions are nece&s;&s;ary for Parents to give their Children upon this account?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> They ought to command
<PB N="106" REF="039314_0115_1013FD39DF6D8458">
them to Cry to the Real and Mer|ciful God, in a Humble and Reve|rent manner to &s;hew them their lo&s;t &amp; undone Condition without Chri&s;t, and to give them Wi&s;dom and his Heavenly Grace to renew his Image in them, lo&s;t by the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> and to be&s;tow the&s;e and all other good things upon them for Chri&s;ts &s;ake.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>How &s;hould God's Children Pray, according to tho&s;e Directions given in the Lord's Prayer?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> From the Preface, <HI>Our Fa|ther which art in Heaven</HI>; we learn to draw near to God with holy Reverence, as Children to a Fa|ther, able and ready to help us; and that we ought to Pray for all God's Children likewi&s;e; 'tis not &s;aid, <HI>O Father,</HI> nor <HI>my Father,</HI> but <HI>Our Father</HI>; we mu&s;t bear all the Saints upon our Hearts when we Pray, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 64.1.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What are we taught to Pray for in the fir&s;t Petition?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="039314_0116_1013FD7DE00CE908"><HI>An&s;.</HI> In the&s;e words, <HI>Hallowed be thy Name,</HI> we are taught to glo|rifie God in all his Attributes, or how&s;oever el&s;e he is made known to us and that every thing may ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to his own Glory, and to &s;eek his Glory before our own good.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What do we de&s;ire in the &s;econd Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> In the &s;econd petition <HI>Thy Kingdom come,</HI> we are taught to Pray that God would de&s;troy the the Kingdom of Satan, that &s;o the Kingdom of Grace may come with power upon our Hearts; and that rhe Kingdom of Glory, or God's Vi&s;ible Kingdom may be ha&s;tened and &s;et up with power in the World, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 68.1. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.18&punc; <HI>Dan.</HI> 7.27.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What are we directed to to pray for in the third Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> In the third Petition, <HI>Thy Will be done,</HI> we are taught to Pray that God by Grace would help us

to do (and &s;ubmit to) his Will in all things, as the Angels do it in Heaven.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What is it we de&s;ire or are to Pray for in the fourth Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> In the fourth Petition, <HI>Give us this day our daily Bread,</HI> we are taught to Pray that God would give us all things which are needful for us in this Life; by which we acknowledge God to be the Fountain of all Earthly Mercies of Good Things, as well as of Spiri|tual, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 90.17. <HI>Acts</HI> 1.727.</P>
<P>Que&s;t <HI>What do we Pray for in the fifth Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> In the fifth Petition, <HI>And forgive us our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive them that Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us,</HI> we are taught to ask Forgivene&s;s or Pardon of God, <HI>viz.</HI> that he would through the Attonement Chri&s;t hath made by his Blood, forgive us all our Sins, and impute Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s to us by Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.23. and not only to beg pardon,
<PB N="109" REF="039314_0118_1013FD7F6445E768">
but al&s;o the &s;ence or &s;ight of Par|don and Forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t. What do we ask of God in the &s;ixth Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> In the &s;ixth Petition we are taught to beg of God that he would not &s;uffer us to fall into &s;uch a State or Company, that may <HI>lead us into Temptation</HI> to Sin a|gain&s;t God.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>What doth the Conclu&s;ion of this Prayer teach us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The Conclu&s;ion of this Prayer which runs thus, <HI>For thine is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory for ever, Amen,</HI> doth teach us to a&s;cribe all Prai&s;e and Glory to God, who&s;e Power, Kingdom &amp; Glory is over all for ever and ever, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.20. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.11. 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 2.13</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>How oughte&s;t thou to Pray then, doe&s;t thou learn from hence and other Scriptures in general?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I learn&punc; that we ought to

Pray in the Spirit, that my Spirit mu&s;t Pray; &amp; that too, by the help of the holy Spirit of God; ad that I ought to Pray with Under|&s;tanding.

And la&s;tly, That we ought in the fir&s;t place to &s;eek the Honour of God before our one good, and to &s;eek the good of our Souls before the good of our Bodies; and that we &s;hould in Prayer de&s;ign &amp; &s;eek the good of others, as well as our own good.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Negatively, our Mediator is not made known by the Works of Creation, nor by the Light which is in all men; by the vi&s;ible things that are made, we may know there is a Creator, yet hereby we can't know there is a Redeemer or Mediator, who was Born of the Virgin, Crucified, Dead and Buried, Rai&s;ed again, and a&s;cended into Heaven; there|fore in the Affirmative, Chri&s;t (as our Redeemer) is only made known by the Divine Revelation of the holy Scripture.</P>

<HEAD>Of Numeration.</HEAD>
<P>NUmeration teaches how to &s;et down any Number &s;poken of or propo&s;ed; to read it truly when written. To which purpo&s;e you are to take notice, that we com|monly expre&s;s all <HI>Numbers</HI> by the&s;e nine Figures, 1 <HI>One,</HI> 2 <HI>two,</HI> 3 <HI>three,</HI> 4 <HI>four,</HI> 5 <HI>five,</HI> 6 <HI>&s;ix,</HI> 7 <HI>&s;even,</HI> 8 <HI>eight</HI> 9 <HI>nine,</HI> and 0, which is called a <HI>Cypher,</HI> and by &s;ome <HI>Nought,</HI> be|cau&s;e of it &s;elf it &s;tands for <HI>nothing,</HI> yet encrea&s;es the Value of other Figures that &s;tand behind it, in the &s;ame manner. Every Figure aug|ments its proper Value, according to the place it happens to be in, except the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Any of the <HI>Nine Figures</HI> in the fir&s;t place, &s;ignifies only its own &s;ingle <HI>value</HI>; in the &s;econd place, &s;o many times <HI>Ten</HI>; in the third place, &s;o many <HI>Hundreds</HI>; in the

<P>As for <HI>Example,</HI> In this Num|ber 1234567, the 7 is barely &s;even <HI>&V;nites</HI> or <HI>Ones</HI>; but the 6 in the &s;econd place, is <HI>&s;ix</HI> times <HI>ten,</HI> that is, <HI>&s;ixty</HI>; the 5 in the third place, is <HI>one hundred Times five,</HI> that is, <HI>five hundred</HI>; the 4, a <HI>thou&s;and times four,</HI> or <HI>four thou&s;and</HI>; the 3, <HI>three times ten thou&s;and</HI>; that is, <HI>Thirty Thou&s;and</HI>; the 2 in the &s;ixth place, is <HI>two hundred Thou&s;and</HI>; and the 1 in the 7th place, is <HI>one ten hundred Thou&s;and,</HI> or a <HI>Thou&s;and Thou&s;and,</HI> which is <HI>one Million.</HI></P>
<P>All which being put together in your Under&s;tanding, you mu&s;t read the afore&s;aid &s;um (1234567) thus, <HI>One Million, two hundred thirty four Thou&s;and, five hundred &s;ixty &s;even.</HI> But this Number, 7654321 (which

<P>A <HI>Comma</HI> [,] is a Note of &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;tay or &s;top in reading.</P>

cea&s;ing.</HI> Here the &s;top or pau&s;e mu&s;t be longer, that the Reader may recover his breath, and the Hearer have time to reflect a little on what is delivered, before they proceed to new matter.</P>
<P>An <HI>Interrogation</HI> Point, [?] is placed after the asking a Que&s;tion. As, <HI>Why do the Heathen rage? And the people imagine a vain thing?</HI> In reading, make near as long a pau&s;e here, as at a Period.</P>
<P>A <HI>Parenthe&s;is</HI> () is put to inclo&s;e any new clau&s;e or matter that is added before a man hath fully ex|pre&s;&s;ed his Mind, the &s;ence being good, if that which is added were left out. As where <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>For I know in me, (that is, in my fle&s;h) dwelleth no good.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Admiration</HI> [!] is put after words that expre&s;s &s;omething &s;trange, or to be wondered at, as, <HI>O the depth of the Riches, both of the Wi&s;dom and Knowledge of God!</HI></P>
