<HEAD>WILLIAM FLEMING, (who was taken about the fir&s;t of November la&s;t) after giving a &s;mall Account of the E&s;cape of one BURNS, who was taken by the Indians, goes on:</HEAD>
<P>I Was in the Neighbourhood where<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burns <HI>had been taken Pri&s;oner by the</HI> Delaware <HI>Indians &s;ome Time before</HI> Fleming, <HI>and was carried to their Wigwams, but being one Day &s;ent to a Spring for Water, with an Indian Guard, in returning, he &s;topped under Pretence of tying his Mocka&s;heens which were loo&s;e. All the</HI> Indians <HI>who was his Guard, got out of Sight; when he im|mediately mounted a hor&s;e nigh at Hand, and rode full Speed to the inhabited Parts of the</HI> Province.</NOTE> <HI>Burns</HI> gave the above Relation, 7 Miles from my own Home, and though many who heard him, treated it as only the groundle&s;s Surmi&s;es of the Timorous, having too favourable an Opinion of the friendly Attachment of the&s;e Indians to this Province; yet I was determined however not to be too Fool-hardy, but ha&s;ten home, and remove my Wife and Effects to a neighbouring Fort. But, alas! by the Time I had got within two Miles of my Hou&s;e, two <HI>Indians</HI> &s;tarted from behind the Root of a Tree, clo&s;e by the Way Side, and had hold of my Hor&s;e's Bridle by the Time I well &s;aw them. They commanded me to alight, very complai&s;antly &s;hook Hands, and told me (for they could &s;peak good Engli&s;h) I mu&s;t go with them: But oh! what Tongue can utter the Horror and Confu&s;ion which in an In&s;tant overwhelmed me, on find|ing my&s;elf in the very Hands of tho&s;e I was flying to a|void: I &s;tood trembling and Speechle&s;s for &s;ome Time,
<PB N="4" REF="007662_0003_102DB9E66F6CC328">
which my Enemies, &s;avage as they were, took Notice of, and endeavoured to encourage me, by clapping me &s;eve|ral Times on the Shoulder, and bidding me not be afraid, for as I looked young and lu&s;ty, they would not hurt me, provided I was willing to go with them, and promi&s;e to &s;tand by them, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould be attack'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in our future Proceedings: One of them who was pretty well dre&s;&s;ed, told me his Name was Captain JACOB, and that he was Captain over the <HI>Indians</HI> in that Expedition, being 50 in all: He &s;aid he knew I could be of Service in leading him to tho&s;e Hou&s;es that were mo&s;t defencele&s;s; and added, that if I proved faithful, he would u&s;e me well, and &s;aid, that tho' he was Captain over the afore&s;aid <HI>Indians,</HI> yet he had only one with him, and they were afraid to venture on Hou&s;es that had many Inhabitants, and that he would &s;pare my Life on Condi|tion I would help.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e fair Promi&s;es I began to recover my Sen|&s;es, and finding I mu&s;t either act the Part he had a&s;&s;ign'd me, or &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t cruel Torture, I concluded it mo&s;t expedient to do the Former, remembring the &s;ay|ing in <HI>Job, All that a Man hath will he give for his Life:</HI> But when I reflected on the Part I had undertaken to act, when I con&s;idered the dreadful Con&s;equences of my In|formations, I was grieved beyond Mea&s;ure, and led the Way more like a condemn'd Criminal to meet his Fate, than one that had a Promi&s;e of Life and Happine&s;s: Be&s;ides the Thoughts of leaving my poor dear Wife for ever, without being able to inform her of my Fate, or her own Danger, almo&s;t di&s;tracted me. My Ma&s;ter per|ceiving me dejected, and &s;omewhat backward in my In|telligence, concluded I &s;hould be more Trouble than Ad|vantage to him, and began not only to alter his Conduct, but gave me to under&s;tand that I was no longer at my own Di&s;po&s;al: This obliged me, though with Reluctance, to confe&s;s, I had a Wife not many Miles off, and that all my Concern was for her; upon which he told me he was glad to hear that, for they wanted a Woman to make Bread for them, and therefore in&s;i&s;ted on my leading them
<PB N="5" REF="007662_0004_102DB9E8088EC3F0">
to my Hou&s;e: Though indeed from &s;ome Part of their former Treatment, I had no Rea&s;on to expect any Argu|ments to induce me to a Compliance, in whatever they thought proper to demand, yet whatever might be the real Motive, they u&s;ed &s;everal on this Occa&s;ion; one of which was, that it would be better to have her along with my&s;elf, than &s;uffer her to &s;tay where &s;he was, as there was great Danger of &s;ome other <HI>Indians</HI> coming that Way, which if they did, &s;he need expect no Mercy at their Hands; for he, Captain <HI>Jacob,</HI> had ordered his <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;pare none but young Men and young Women. This Information quite revived me, and I was even glad of the Privilege of leading them that Way: I knew we had to pa&s;s by one <HI>Hicks'</HI>s, who had a numerous Family of able young Men, and was in great Hopes of being re&s;cued by them: But when we came within Sight of the Hou&s;e, they did not advance towards it as I expected, but pa&s;&s;ed by at a Di&s;tance, and then &s;topped to con&s;ider what was mo&s;t proper to be done. Whil&s;t we tarried here, it unfortu|nately happened that two of <HI>Hicks'</HI>s Sons came out from Dinner, in order to work at an adjacent new Settlement: The <HI>Indians</HI> on &s;eeing them ran behind Trees, and order|ed me to do the &s;ame between them: I complied, but was in hopes the&s;e <HI>Two</HI> would be followed out by &s;ome more of the Family, which might afford me an Opportunity of E&s;cape; but my Hopes were &s;oon fru&s;trated, for they having no Su&s;picion of Danger, advanced carele&s;ly on till the foremo&s;t came oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Indian</HI> that &s;tood neare&s;t to me, who immediately &s;prung out and &s;eiz'd and pinion'd the unhappy Victim. He &s;creamed in a mo&s;t piteous Manner for Help, but alas! there was none to be found. His Brother fled back to the Hou&s;e with the utmo&s;t Pre|cipitation, whence not one would venture out. For my Part I was not in a Condition to afford the lea&s;t Relief, not being allowed to carry even a Stick about me. They then hurried us away towards my Hou&s;e with the utmo&s;t Speed, fearing their new Captive might be relea&s;ed by his Relations.</P>
<P>The unhappy Youth not being accu&s;tomed to &s;uch
<PB N="6" REF="007662_0005_102DB9E9B66E76A8">
Treatment as he now met with; and not being appriz|ed of the bad Con&s;equences that might attend the lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance, di&s;covered great unea&s;ine&s;s, and could not be prevailed upon to keep &s;ilent: Had not the <HI>Indians</HI> been acquainted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, I &s;hould have thought it my Duty to admoni&s;h him to a Compliance with their capricious Humours, till Providence might favour us with an Opportunity of E&s;cape: But as I could advance no|thing to mitigate his Grief but what might tend to betray my Intentions, and convince my Enemies that I was not &s;o taken with my pre&s;ent way of Life, nor &s;o much at|tached to their Intere&s;t as they imagined, I was obliged to be entirely &s;ilent, and leave him to their Management.</P>
<P>Though they &s;poke all their Secrets in their own Lan|guage, I could plainly perceive Re&s;entment kindle in their very Looks, which made me &s;hudder and tremble for his Fate: But why do I &s;ay his, &s;eeing my Life was as much at the Di&s;po&s;al of the&s;e mercile&s;s Wretches as his, and I had no Rea&s;on to expect but that when they began, we &s;hould equally fall a Sacrifice to their cruel Re&s;entment: All the Advantages I had to boa&s;t of &s;uperior to him were, that I had been longer in their Service, and had the Policy to counterfeit a chearful Behaviour, whil&s;t he continued ob&s;tinate to the la&s;t Degree; but whether they would conde&s;cend to take the&s;e Things into Con|&s;ideration, I was at a Lo&s;s to determine.</P>
<P>We had now got within a Mile of my Hou&s;e, when my poor Wife &s;hould have employed all my Thoughts, had they not been diverted by my own melancholy Situ|ation: For being now in the mid&s;t of a con&s;iderable Thick|et, our Ma&s;ters came to another con&s;ultation concerning their future Proceedings. Which being done, one of them being placed near a Tree, ordered me to advance towards him, which I did, with my u&s;ual Submi&s;&s;ion, not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting his De&s;ign: But if I had, the lea&s;t &s;eeming Reluctance might have proved my Ruin. He then placed him&s;elf on the oppo&s;ite Side of the Tree, or|dered me to &s;it down with my Back to the Tree, and after pulling my Arms backwards round it, tied them
<PB N="7" REF="007662_0006_102DB9ECC0F51248">
with a Deer's Sinew, then put on Leather Muffs on my Hands, to keep me from u&s;ing my Fingers, and then tied them likewi&s;e together. I had the Mortification to find my Timerity only excited Ridicule and Laughter in my <HI>cruel Per&s;ecutors,</HI> who made Sport of my Mi&s;eries and mock'd at my Fears.</P>
<P>Being &s;o intent upon my own Pre&s;ervation, it may ea&s;ily be imagined I could not be very attentive to the Fate of my unhappy Companion: I &s;aw him however &s;eized by the Indian who was with Capt. <HI>Jacob,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>Jim,</HI> who with remor&s;ele&s;s Cruelty gave him a Blow with the Back of his Tomahawk which &s;tunn'd him; but before he fell, another was repeated in the &s;ame Manner, which brought him to the Ground, where he lay &s;ome Minutes motionle&s;s: The inhuman Wretch &s;tood over him, in order to di&s;cover if any Signs of Life remain'd, and upon finding him &s;tir, and put up his Hand to his Face to wipe off the Blood which quite blinded him, took up the &s;ame Tomahawk that had brought him thus near his End, and with one fatal Blow &s;unk it in his Skull. This tragical Scene renewed their Sport, they af|fecting to imitate his expiring Agonies: There remained nothing now to compleat their inhuman Barbarity but to &s;calp him which was done almo&s;t in an In&s;tant. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe my Horror on &s;eeing this: Death at|tended with its mo&s;t frightful Terrors &s;tared me in the Face, and I even wi&s;hed I had been &s;o happy as to have been fir&s;t out of Pain, and not lived to &s;ee what I un|doubtedly thought next Moment would be my own Fate thus barbarou&s;ly acted in that of my Companion. The cruel Mon&s;ters all over be&s;mared with his Blood advanced towards me, and told me with an Air of In&s;ult, nothing out my good Behaviour for the future, &s;hould &s;ave me from the &s;ame Treatment; and &s;o untied my Hands, which were &s;o benum'd that I hardly ever expected to be able to u&s;e them.</P>
<P>We now advanced again towards my Hou&s;e, and in a little Time came within Sight of it! But alas! with what Regret did I introduce my Gue&s;ts to my poor Wife:
<PB N="8" REF="007662_0007_102DB9EEEAC8CDF8">
She, poor Thing, upon &s;eeing them, had like to have fallen into Fits. I gave her all the Con&s;olation I was able, tho' Horror and De&s;pair was vi&s;ible in my very Looks: I told her, Cries and Tears would now avail nothing, and &s;he could not better recommend her&s;elf to our Ma&s;ter's Favour, than by being chearful, and rea|dy to obey. Whil&s;t I was thus employed the <HI>Indians</HI> were bu&s;ied in ran&s;acking the Hou&s;e from Top to Bot|tom, of every Thing they thought worth taking, and after they had made up a Sack of Meal for me, and a Bundle of Clothes for my Wife to carry, commanded us to depart. Here our Grief was again renewed on leaving our Hou&s;e, Stock, Grain, and in &s;hort our All, behind us, without being able to depute any one to take Care of them in our Ab&s;ence, or the mo&s;t di&s;tant Pro&s;pect of ever re|turning to them. The&s;e Reflections however ju&s;t, availed us Nothing, for before we left Sight of the Hou&s;e, the Captain ordered <HI>Jim,</HI> to return and &s;et Fire to it, which he did &s;o effectually, that in a few Minutes the whole was in a Blaze. As complaining of this Hard&s;hip to our cruel Per&s;ecutors would have no more effect than &s;peaking to the Wind, we addre&s;&s;ed our&s;elves to the ALMIGHTY for his Protection, with a becoming Refignation to whatever might be our Fate; when we &s;et off from my Hou&s;e it was about 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon, we directed our Cour&s;e right back in the Woods about Half a Mile, they bid us put down our Luggage, and the Captain ordered <HI>Jim</HI> and me to go and hunt Hor&s;es to carry my Wife and the Luggage, which we accordingly did, but not getting any, we went to the afore&s;aid <HI>Hicks</HI>s, and in go|ing down the Lane towards the Hou&s;e <HI>Jim</HI> took hold of me by the Shoulder, and in approaching the Hou&s;e al|ways kept me between him and it, thinking they would not &s;hoot at me, and if they did, I &s;hould &s;crene him from the Shot; when we came up to the Door of the Hou&s;e, which was open, he quitted me, and jump'd in|to the Hou&s;e, with his Tomahawk in one Hand and Gun in the other, but found the People all gone, for on the Alarm afore&s;aid, the whole of the Family, &s;even in
<PB N="9" REF="007662_0008_102DB9F07258EA80">
Number, had de&s;erted the Hou&s;e, and were making to|wards a Fort, but, unhappily for them, fell in with another Party of &s;aid <HI>Indians,</HI> who murdered two of them, and took the re&s;t Pri&s;oners [as I afterwards was in|formed by the Inhabitants of <HI>Conecochieg.</HI>] When he found that the Hou&s;e was de&s;erted, he rumaged up &s;uch Things as plea&s;ed him be&s;t, and carried 'em to &s;ome Di&s;|tance where he laid them down, then he &s;et Fire to the Hou&s;e, and ordered me to gather up all things that were of U&s;e to the Owners and put them therein, and at the &s;ame Time bid me &s;et Fire to the Barn, in which was a large Quantity of Grain, and likewi&s;e to &s;everal Barracks of Grain and Fodder, that &s;tood by it, which I &s;eem'd heartily to comply with, but purpo&s;ely avoided firing the Barn and Grain by employing my&s;elf in gathering up the fir&s;t-mentioned, and burning them. When all Things were thrown in the Fire that was near the Hou&s;e, we went to make up our Bundles in order to make off, but <HI>Jim</HI> by looking about him, di&s;covered that the Barn, &amp;c. were not fired according to his Orders; he a&s;k'd me what was the Rea&s;on I had not done it? I excus'd my&s;elf by telling him I was fully employ'd in burning the other Things: he then ha&s;tily ran and took a Brand of Fire, and quickly &s;et them all in Flames. We then made the be&s;t of our Way with the Plunder to the Place where we had left Capt. <HI>Jacob</HI> and my Wife, found their Bundles, but they gone; while I was conjecturing the Rea&s;on, <HI>Jim</HI> gave a Whi&s;tle, and the Capt. an&s;wer'd (who had mov'd him&s;elf to &s;ome Di&s;tance, for Security, le&s;t I &s;hould by &s;ome Means or other kill <HI>Jim,</HI> and bring the white People upon him.) When we di&s;covered where they were, we ran to him, and <HI>Jim</HI> related our Succe&s;s, and told how well (as he &s;aid) I had behaved. Upon which the Capt. gave me his Hand, and &s;aid, <HI>Well done Brother, you &s;hall go to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with us To-morrow.</HI></P>
<P>My Wife's Relation of what pa&s;&s;ed betwixt her and Capt. <HI>Jacob,</HI> after I and <HI>Jim</HI> went to catch Hor&s;es, is as follows: <HI>She was very unea&s;y to be left alone with Capt.</HI> Jacob, <HI>and wanted to go after us to help catch the Hor&s;es;
<PB N="10" REF="007662_0009_102DB9F31BC396F8">
but he would not &s;uffer it, &s;aying, She was not able, and &s;he mu&s;t &s;tay with him till we returned, further adding, that &s;he need not be afraid of him for he would not hurt her; he then threw a Shirt of mine to her, and an old Petticoat, ordered her to &s;trip and put on the Shirt and Petticoat, which &s;he complied with, and while &s;he was do|ing it, he turn'd his Back on her, and went to &s;ome di&s;tance with the other Indian's Bundle, and plunder'd it of &s;uch Things as he liked. When he return'd he took the Cloths &s;he pull'd off and put them in his Bundle, and bid her not to tell</HI> Jim <HI>what he had done; then they mov'd off to &s;ome Di&s;tance, where we found them.</HI></P>
<P>About Sun-down we pitched on a Place for our Lodg|ing, and our next Bu&s;ine&s;s was to get Wood and make a Fire, round which we &s;at without Di&s;tinction; which to Per&s;ons in our Circum&s;tances, may be e&s;teemed a Mark of no &s;mall Conde&s;cention.</P>
<P>My Wife being embold'ned by the Familiarity of our Ma&s;ters a&s;k'd them &s;everal Que&s;tions touching their Rea|&s;ons for u&s;ing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as they did, &s;eeing they had always treated the <HI>Indians</HI> (particularly the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI>) with the greate&s;t Friend&s;hip: To this they an&s;wered, <HI>That when a Number of</HI> Indians <HI>offered to join G&mdash;l</HI> B&mdash;k <HI>again&s;t the</HI> French, <HI>he did not u&s;e them well, and had threatned to de&s;troy all the</HI> Indians <HI>on the Continent, after they had conquered the</HI> French, <HI>and they were informed by the</HI> French, <HI>the</HI> Penn&s;ylvanians, Marylanders <HI>and</HI> Virginians <HI>had laid the &s;ame Plot.</HI> She then a&s;ked, what they intended to do with tho&s;e they took Pri&s;oners: To which the Captain an&s;wered, <HI>That they had been order'd by the</HI> French <HI>to bring them all to the</HI> Ohio, <HI>when you get there, you &s;hall live well, and be given as Kindred to our Friends.</HI> (Which I did not be|lieve, as they told my Wife one Story, and me another; but expected every Moment to be &s;acri&s;ic'd by them; yet &s;o far as I could learn, the <HI>French</HI> were to allow them a certain Sum per Scalp and for Pri&s;oners, if they were young, and fit for Bu&s;ine&s;s; but the old People and Chil|dren they kill'd and &s;calped, as well as &s;uch as were re|fractory
<PB N="11" REF="007662_0010_102DB9F5475F5440">
and not willing to go with them.) She then a&s;ked them if they did not think it a Sin to &s;hed &s;o much innocent Blood? They an&s;wered, <HI>That the</HI> French <HI>were better off than the</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>for they had a great many old Men among them that could forgive all their Sins, and the&s;e Men had often a&s;&s;ured the</HI> Indians <HI>it was no Sin to de&s;troy Hereticks, and all the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>were &s;uch. They then told me not to be afraid that they &s;hould abu&s;e my Wife, for they would not do it for Fear of affronting their God,</HI> (and pointed their Hands towards Heaven) <HI>for the Man that affronts his God, will &s;urely be kill'd when he goes out to War; this,</HI> (continued they,) <HI>is what makes the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>have &s;uch bad Luck.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;at up eating Bread and Chee&s;e, and dry'd Peaches, and &s;moking Tobacco, (which they got at <HI>Hicks'</HI>s,) hav|ing had no Tobacco, as they told us, for four or five Days, and were in great Want of it. While they were thus em|ploy'd, I heard a Noi&s;e, which I could not tell the Rea&s;on of. The <HI>Indians</HI> ob&s;erving my li&s;tening, &s;aid, <HI>It is no|thing but the Spirit of that Son of a Whore whom we kill'd.</HI> My Wife then a&s;k'd them if they were not afraid of his Spirit? They an&s;wered, <HI>No! for they were fre|quently us'd to &s;ee them, not only of white People, but of the</HI> Indian <HI>Nations they were at War with; but that Spirits could not hurt them.</HI></P>
<P>About Two Hours before Day our Ma&s;ters being tired with Acts of Cruelty, began to think of compo&s;ing them|&s;elves to Re&s;t. They fir&s;t &s;hewed us where and how to lie, then lay down them&s;elves with their Guns under them, le&s;t we might u&s;e them to their Prejudice: Being thus di&s;po&s;ed, it was not long before they fell into a deep Sleep, which my Wife being watchful to ob&s;erve, began to think on making u&s;e of the Opportunity put into our Hands of making an E&s;cape: She communicated her Sentiments in Whi&s;pers to me, and it is rea&s;onable to think, I &s;hould readily concur in whatever might have a Pro&s;pect of accompli&s;hing what I &s;o ardently de&s;ired: But as a Mi&s;|carriage in an Attempt of this Nature would infallibly have proved our Ruin, common Prudence required we
<PB N="12" REF="007662_0011_102DB9F77653DE10">
&s;hould act cautiou&s;ly, and be &s;ure they were in reality in as deep a Slumber as they pretended to be: To this end, we got up, and went to the Fire, under Pretence of mend|ing it, and warming our&s;elves, (and indeed we &s;tood in need of it having nothing to defend us from the Incle|mency of the Weather, but a &s;ingle Blanket.) In all which we made &s;o much Bu&s;tle and Noi&s;e, as we judged might awake Per&s;ons in an ordinary Sleep: But finding they &s;till &s;noared on, I took up a Tankard, and told my Wife I would go towards a Spring, at which I had been fre|quently before, and if after I had got there they &s;till &s;lept on, de&s;ired &s;he might follow: And added, that if they &s;hould awake e're we got off, our having the Tankard might convince them we really wanted to quench our Thir&s;t.</P>
<P>When we took leave of our cold Lodging, we had no Intention of &s;eparating: For tho' we left the Fire at dif|ferent Times we intended to meet at the Spring: But after I had got there, and waited &s;ome Time, I at la&s;t &s;aw her a coming, I threw down my Tankard intending to hide my&s;elf on the other Side the Run in a Thicket, till &s;he came up; but in my Hurry, I ran again&s;t a Sap|pling which &s;tunn'd me, and I lay in this Condition &s;ome Time (during which I &s;uppose my Wife came to the Run and not finding me made the be&s;t of her Way off.) When I recovered, I went on in the be&s;t Manner I could till Day began to dawn, when I found my&s;elf within Sight of a Hou&s;e to my un&s;peakable Joy: When I ad|vanced near it I knew the Place, which however was quite abandoned by the Dwellers.</P>
<P>Having now a tolerable good Knowledge of my Situa|tion I made directly to the next inhabited Part of <HI>Coneco|chieg,</HI> when I got there, I was informed that a Company of Three Hundred Men from Mar&s;h-Creek were out in que&s;t of the Enemy under Colonel <HI>Hamilton,</HI> I joined my&s;elf as &s;oon as I could with the&s;e, intending to return with them and try to find out my Wife, with who&s;e Con|dition I was now more affected, being out of Danger my|&s;elf.</P>

We went on viewing the Deva&s;tation, till we came to <HI>Adam McConnel'</HI>s Plantation, where we met with a Party of Ten Men, who had &s;eparated from this Com|pany &s;ome Time before: The&s;e brought in a Woman who they &s;aid was found by them at an Oven in great Di&s;tre&s;s; and whom, upon my nearer Approach, to my un&s;peakable Surprize and Joy, I found to be my Wife.</P>
<P>After greeting each other in the mo&s;t affectionate Man|ner, with Tears of Joy, we returned Thanks to that in|dulgent Being who led us &s;afe through the Wilderne&s;s, and pre&s;erved us from the Jaws of Death.

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the &s;urprizing Deliverance of Elizabeth Fleming, (Wife of William Fleming,) who was taken Captive by Capt. Jacob.</HEAD>
<P>A Few Minutes after my Hu&s;band was gone from the Fire, finding the <HI>Indians</HI> took no Notice of it, I concluded they were &s;till a&s;leep, and ac|cording to my Promi&s;e followed him, but not finding him at the Spring, knew not which Cour&s;e to &s;teer, which threw me into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion; yet I re|&s;olved to make my E&s;cape, and endeavoured for that Purpo&s;e; but really I &s;eem'd in as bad a Situation as ever. <Q>How dreadful was this Night to me, an un|happy Wanderer! With what Floods of Tears did I pa&s;s the Time? No Friend to relieve me, no Habita|tion in which to &s;helter my&s;elf from the Inclemency of the Weather: My Hu&s;band gone I knew not where, and my&s;elf a wretched forlorn Wanderer, in Danger every Moment of falling a Prey to &s;avage Fury, or torn to Pieces by ravenous wild Bea&s;ts. I either heard, or my frighted Imagination &s;ugge&s;ted, the hideous Roaring of Wolves, Bears and Panthers, which terri|fied
<PB N="14" REF="007662_0013_102DB9FB52B88E88">
me almo&s;t to Death: Yet I was not &s;o lo&s;t and overwhelmed as to be incapable of Reflection; I re|membred there was a ju&s;t, a merciful and an Almighty Power, who &s;aw my Mi&s;eries, and knew I had not brought it on my&s;elf by any Imprudence, unle&s;s en|deavouring to &s;ave my Life by Flight might be term|ed &s;uch.</Q></P>
<P>However after I had wandered &s;ome Time, I came to a little Hill, which when I had a&s;cended, found my&s;elf &s;till nearer my Enemies than I de&s;ired, for I could plain|ly perceive the Fire blaze, by the Light of which I &s;aw them lie in the &s;ame Po&s;ture I left them. I made off with as much Precipitation as I could, and continued wandering till Day, during which Time I fell over a dead Man, which I concluded to be <HI>Hicks,</HI> and therefore di|rected my Cour&s;e accordingly for our own Corn-field, near the Remains of our Hou&s;e. The Joy however I conceived at this was &s;oon allayed by hearing two <HI>Indian</HI> Holo's, and the Report of five Guns. Fancying my&s;elf now in the Jaws of Death, I made directly to &s;ome Heaps of Fodder, and hid my&s;elf, and lay there &s;ome Time; when I left this I directed my Cour&s;e along a Path nine Miles to a Fort, but found it de&s;erted, and every Thing about it in the greate&s;t Di&s;order; concluding there was little Shelter to be had here, I a&s;cended a Hill hard by, from the Top of which I imagined I &s;hould be able to di&s;cover &s;ome Settlements, or at lea&s;t &s;ome Road that might lead that Way; but when I began to look about, I &s;aw &s;o many Hou&s;es in a Blaze that I almo&s;t concluded the whole Province was in Flames. The Smoke flew &s;o thick that it darkened the very Air about me to that Degree, as to prevent me from di&s;tingui&s;hing any Thing at a Di&s;tance from the Fires. <Q>Let any one figure to them&s;elves the Melancholly of my Condition; no Hu&s;|band to relieve me, or eleviate my Grief! Yet how light, how trifling was all I now endured, to tho&s;e Hard&s;hips which &s;oon after I was obliged to bear.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;oon after left the Hill, and was going I knew not where, when I came up to a Hou&s;e almo&s;t con&s;umed to
<PB N="15" REF="007662_0014_102DB9FD73167DC0">
A&s;hes, and &s;aw near it &s;everal Cows newly killed, by which I concluded the Enemy could not be far off; I ran to look for &s;ome Place in which to &s;ecure my&s;elf from their Fury, but could find none: I perceived one of the Cows the&s;e inhuman Butchers had &s;hot was not quite dead, and as &s;he lay almo&s;t clo&s;e to a Fence, &s;trctched my&s;elf down behind her; but had not been long in that Po&s;ture before I heard two Guns go off, by which I ap|prehended the Enemy were advancing towards me, and con&s;equently the Place in which I had now taken Refuge, could not be very &s;afe: So I crept to a Thicket, where I lay till Half an Hour pa&s;t Sun-down, when hearing all quiet round me, removed to an Oven, belonging to <HI>Ro|bert McConnel,</HI> and after &s;ome Difficulty got into it, and re&s;ted about an Hour; but being terrified with frightful Thoughts, and not being able to reconcile my&s;elf to it longer, left it, with an Intention to go to the Top of another Hill. Before I got quite up, I happened una|wares almo&s;t on a Fire, by the Side of which lay two <HI>Indians,</HI> with white Match-coats: The Sight almo&s;t frighted me to Death, but I had no other Shift than to run behind a Tree, where I &s;tood trembling for near Half an Hour. As I had no Notion of being &s;o near Ruin, I advanced carele&s;ly on, and made &s;o much Noi&s;e among the Leaves and Shrubs as I then apprehended a|waked the&s;e Blood-hounds, who immediately &s;tarted up, took up their Guns, then li&s;tened: I now re&s;igned my|&s;elf to the Will of Providence, thinking my Mi&s;eries near at an End, but all on a &s;udden they returned to their Fire making a loud Laugh; by this I found my Gla&s;s was not yet run. This Conduct at fir&s;t appeared truly &s;urprizing, for though indeed I now &s;tood behind a Tree, I was al|mo&s;t fure they had &s;een me. Whil&s;t I was thus con|jecturing the Rea&s;on of the miraculous Pre&s;ervation, I heard two or three Hogs grunt and &s;tir among the Leaves (which my Fright had not &s;uffered me before to ob|&s;erve) between whom and the Enemy I was behind a Tree, I concluded that it had been the Noi&s;e made by them they had been awaked. <Q>How wonderful, how my&s;terious,
<PB N="16" REF="007662_0015_102D7424C3623218">
are the Ways of Heaven? By what un&s;een, ungue&s;&s;ed at Means are frequently the greate&s;t Deliverances bro't about.</Q></P>
<P>Being thus &s;urprizingly &s;aved, I tarried behind the Tree till I judged the Enemy had got to &s;leep, and then made the be&s;t of my Way, ble&s;&s;ing God for his remark|able Deliverance, and wandred through the Woods till Day-break.</P>
<P>When I got pretty clear, I perceived a large Moun|tain which I conjectured to be that between the Great and Little-Cove, and by the Idea I then formed of the Country and my own Situation, imagined going over it would be the nighe&s;t Way to the inhabited Parts. As the Road was very bad, and the Mountain at a con&s;ide|rable Di&s;tance, it co&s;t me great Difficulty to reach it; and before I got to the Top, found my&s;elf &s;o feeble, and my Spirits &s;o much &s;unk, that I was unable to proceed any further: So I lay down, whil&s;t a cold Sweat poured off me, and I &s;uffered all the Agonies of Mind, a Per&s;on in my Condition (being with Child) could undergo. I continued thus for Half an Hour, when being a little re|vived I reflected that I mu&s;t either endeavour to move farther, or inevitably peri&s;h: I attempted again to climb up, but my feet being all in Bli&s;ters, and the Mountain &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible, that before I had got a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot up, found it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;t again: And thus I continued re&s;ting and crawling for about three Hours, till at length I attained the Summit; when I found my&s;elf &s;o much &s;pent with Fatigue and want of Food, that I was obliged to throw my&s;elf flat on my Face, and in that Po&s;ture lay for near an Hour. When I rai&s;ed my&s;elf up, I e&s;pied some Che&s;tnut Hu&s;ks, and was in hopes of finding among&s;t them &s;ome Che&s;tnuts; but found that Squirrels or other Vermin had deprived me of that Satisfaction. I then look|ed around me in order to di&s;cover &s;ome Place that was inhabited, but the Sky was &s;o darkned with Smoak, that I could only di&s;tingui&s;h two Hou&s;es in Flames. <Q>It is im|po&s;&s;ible to defcribe the Horror of my Condition in this Place, which was augmented by my not knowing (even
<PB N="17" REF="007662_0016_102DB9FFCB4DAD40">
if I was able) which Side to turn to: Every Place I could lay my Eyes on, &s;eemed to be filled with De&s;o|lation and Ruin. A Train of melanchollic Reflections ru&s;hed on my Mind: I was even weary of Life, and could have wi&s;hed my Being at an End: Yea I had nigh loaded the Day of my Birth with as many Impre|cations as <HI>Job:</HI> And a&s;ked, <HI>Why was I re&s;erved for &s;o much Mi&s;ery?</HI> It would indeed, have been utterly impo&s;&s;ible for me to have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;urvived, weakned as I was by hard Living, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Fatigue I under|went, had not that Almighty <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, who when we think him farthe&s;t off, is often neare&s;t to us with his Aid, &s;natched my almo&s;t &s;inking Soul from the Mi|&s;eries in which I had long been plunged and graciou&s;ly encouraged me to hope Deliverence in his own good Time.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus given Vent to my Grief, by Tears and Reflection, I thought on returning whence I came; which I did in the be&s;t Manner I could: But before I had got two Miles, was overtaken by a Hor&s;e, who came after me full Speed, with his Bridle Head and a Bell on, and &s;eemed to be very much frighted: I u&s;ed my be&s;t Endeavours to &s;top and catch him, for I thought if I could once get on Hor&s;e-back, I &s;hould be able to make much greater Speed in my future &s;earches: But he &s;oon made his Way from me, and as I was not in a Condition to follow him, was obliged to drop all Thoughts of that Nature. Whil&s;t I was thus engaged, I was alarmed by an Indian Holo, by which I judged the Owner of the Hor&s;e had fell a Prey to the&s;e Blood-thir&s;ty Wretches, and con&s;equently they could not be far from me: I was now at my Wits-end to find a Place of Shelter, being afraid even to look about me, le&s;t I might &s;ee them at my Back: I ha&s;ted on with my crawling Speed, till I came to a large Gum Tree, into which I crept, tho' with much Difficulty: It was well however I got in at any Rate, for I heard the Feet of two <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;aw them pa&s;s pretty near me; they were too intent in Pur&s;uit of the Hor&s;e to look much about, which if they had, I &s;hould unavoidably have been di&s;co|vered;
<PB N="18" REF="007662_0017_102DBA02C92D1730">
but as Providence ordered it, I was &s;afe, judged it be&s;t to lie here a con&s;iderable Time, that &s;o the Enemy might get a good Way off. Whil&s;t I lay here, I heard the Report of two Guns, which was accompanied with a terrible Shriek. <Q>Every Moment of my Time now &s;eemed precious, and I thought &s;o much of it as was &s;pent in any one Place, &s;ave the mere Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;av|ing my&s;elf from Danger, lo&s;t;</Q> &s;o I got my&s;elf out, and wandered better than a Mile through a great Thicket till I came to a &s;mall Path, which I gladly pur&s;ued, but unfortunately went the wrong Way in it, which I was not &s;en&s;ible of, till I had gone about a Mile and a Half, when I found the Path end in the Woods. Now again I was put to a Nonplus, and bur&s;t into Tears at my Di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P><Q>To wander again in the Wilderne&s;s &s;eemed certain Death, and to return the &s;ame long Way I came afforded a Pro&s;pect little better; yet maimed as I was, I think I could have chearfully gone many Miles, if I had done it on my Knees, to have met with my Hu&s;band, or any one in a Condition to relieve me: But I was now forlorn in the Wilderne&s;s, and had no other Com|fort than to &s;it down on the cold Earth, indulge my u&s;ual melanchollic Reflections, and bathe my bleeding Feet with my Tears.</Q>&mdash;This being done, I tore off a few of the remaining Rags (for the Bu&s;hes had nigh de|prived me of mo&s;t of them) that my mercile&s;s Ravagers thought not worth taking from me, and with the Hem of my tottered Petticoat (for Gown I had none) tied them round my Feet, and returned the &s;ame Way, and con|tinued my Cour&s;e till I got to a Corn-field, where I found three Ears of Corn: I &s;aw &s;everal Stacks of Fod|der, but was afraid to take up my Lodging in them, le&s;t when the Indians came that way they might &s;et Fire to them; for they &s;eem'd to make it a Rule from their fir&s;t &s;etting out to de&s;troy every Thing of Value they met with: So I took two or three Arm-fulls, carried it to a good Di&s;tance, and laid it by a Fence, and &s;o crept a|mong&s;t it, conjecturing they would not, if they &s;aw it,
<PB N="19" REF="007662_0018_102DBA045A0E8840">
think it worth their while to &s;et Fire to &s;o &s;mall a Heap; and in this was my Lodging three Days and three Nights nor daring to &s;tir much out all that Time, as I repeated|ly heard the Report of Guns and Indian Holo's: But indeed, if I had not been prevented through Fear, I was now &s;o &s;pent and fatigued, that I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to cea&s;e rambling till I got recruited; though alas! I had but a poor Pro&s;pect of this, for I was almo&s;t fami&s;hed to Death, having had nothing to live upon but the three Ears of Indian Corn afore&s;aid, and as I knew not when or where to get more, was obliged as it were to count the Grains I eat.</P>
<P>On the Third Night of my being in this lonely Lodg|ing, I heard a Cock crow and a Dog bark, and next Morning made towards the Place I heard them at; but after I had got the Length of the Field, &s;aw three Trees which appeared to be newly &s;et on Fire: &s;o I lay down about an Hour by the Fence, in which Time I heard 3 Guns go off about a Mile above me: However hearing no more Noi&s;e, I made towards a Hou&s;e, which apeared on my nearer approach, to be a Stable, all the Hou&s;es being burnt: This Place I found afterwards belonged to one Donald&s;on: I here found &s;ome Fowls, and attempted to catch one of them, but they were too nimble for me; then I went into the Garden, where I made a very plenti|ful Meal of green Keal and Par&s;ley: I then went to the Spring, and drank about three Pints of Water) not hav|ing &s;een any for &s;everal Days before) I then crept into the Oven (which was left &s;tanding by the Savages) and &s;lept pretty &s;oundly till Midnight, at which Time I awoke and hearing Cock crow, made to the Stable, and caught one, and dre&s;&s;ed it by &s;ome burning Logs of the Dwel|ling hou&s;e. But alas the very Smell of the Fowl &s;o overcame me, that I was ready to faint &s;everal Times ere it was ready; &s;o I put it whole into my Handker|chief, and returned to the Oven, where I &s;lept till Day when I got out and went again in Search of inhabited Hou&s;es. After I had got about Half a Mile, I heard a Man whi&s;tle, which at fir&s;t I took to be a white Man's Whi&s;tle,
<PB N="20" REF="007662_0019_102DBA0698AFB3C0">
but upon li&s;tening more attentive, had Rea&s;on to believe it an Indian Decoy; &s;o I ha&s;ted back to my Lodging, and had not been in it long before I heard the Noi&s;e of Hor&s;es, and the Voices of &s;everal white Men, which made me look out, and &s;eeing one pa&s;s by at &s;ome Di&s;tance, I cried out to him for God's &s;ake to pity my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condi|tion, and take me under his Protection: The good Man being &s;tartled at my &s;udden Appearance, and the &s;trange Figure I cut (being entirely in Rags, and as black as any Chimney-&s;weep) pre&s;ented his Gun, and if it had not mi&s;s'd Fire, he would certainly have deprived me of that wretched Life I had gone through &s;o many Difficulties to pre&s;erve; another of the Company perceiving it, cryed out, <HI>Hold, hold, &s;he is a white Woman by her Voice.</HI> Soon after they all came up to me, and I found them to be a Party of ten Men, &s;eparated from a Mar&s;h Creek Great Company of three Hundred. One of them (Mr. <HI>Dickey,</HI>) was &s;o kind as to take me up behind him on his Hor&s;e, and after tying me on with a Belt (for I was &s;o weak as not to be able to &s;it) took me about three Miles to his Hou&s;e, where I got refre&s;hed with warm Milk, and &s;uch Things as I was able to take, and this Morning was brought to this Place; but what is my A&s;toni&s;hment and Joy when here my Eyes are once more ble&s;&s;ed with the Sight of my Hu&s;band! [<HI>Surely, they might well cry out with</HI> David, <HI>the devout P&s;almi&s;t! I cried unto the LORD with my Voice, and he heard me out of his holy Hill.</HI>]</P>
