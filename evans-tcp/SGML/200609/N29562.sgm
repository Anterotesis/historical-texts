<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Could very willingly have di&s;pens'd with meeting you at this time, not only becau&s;e the Sea&s;on of the Year makes it unea&s;ie to many of you, who live in remote parts of the Coun|try, to give your attendance here, but al&s;o becau&s;e the day of the Anniver&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> A&s;&s;embly is &s;o near.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;ent Exigence of Affairs is &s;uch, That the Council and I have thought it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, we &s;hould meet and con&s;ult about it in General A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> in this and the Neighbouring Colonies, are &s;aid to have Combin'd with the <HI>Ea&s;tern Indians,</HI> intending to make a general In&s;urrection and Rebellion; and if we may Credit the Advices we have from &s;ome hands, the time for Execution of this their ill De&s;ign is near at hand: and &s;o near, that it will be in vain to try to avert the blow by Treaty or the promi&s;e of any advantages to them; but we mu&s;t rather think of Suppre&s;&s;ing them by force of Arms. In order to which you will do well to con&s;ider of a way to make &s;uch Levies of Souldiers as &s;hall be &s;ufficient to defend the Country, and being Levied to Di&s;cipline and make them Expert in the Exerci&s;e and U&s;e of their Arms.</P>
<P>It were not ami&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> if a way were found out to oblige the Forces to March out of the Province as often as the Kings Service requires it; it is our duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t our Neighbours and Fellow Subjects: And it has always been reckoned a point of Policy, and Prudence, to keep danger as much at a di&s;tance as 'tis po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It were well too, if a Law were made to puni&s;h Mutiny, and De&s;ertion, in time of actual War, without which the Souldiers you Rai&s;e, will not be tractable to the Command of their Officers, and &s;o will not an&s;wer your end in Rai&s;ing them.</P>
<P>You will do well to make provi&s;ion of a &s;ufficient quantity of Arms and Ammunition, and that with all the Expedition that may be, That the Country may be furni&s;h'd with both for their Defence.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire you will Inquire into the pre&s;ent State of the Publick Trea&s;ure of the Province; that if we mu&s;t be Engag'd in a War with the <HI>Indians,</HI> there may be no want of Money to Defray the nece&s;&s;ary Charge of it. It belongs to you to con&s;ider what that Charge will be, and to provide Funds accordingly.</P>
<CLOSER>BY Order of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, I do Appoint <HI>Bartholomew Green,</HI> and <HI>John Allen,</HI> to Print His Excellency's Speech.
