<HEAD>THE GOLDEN AGE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN one of our American States, lives the retired and devout Celadon. A man &s;trictly hone&s;t, and a real lover of his country. That &s;uch is his true character, appears by the whole tenor of his conduct for &s;everal years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>During our late noble conte&s;t with Briti&s;h fury, he &s;igna|lized him&s;elf above many of his equals in age and fortune. Not contented to plead the glorious cau&s;e of liberty in private only, he bravely entered the bloody field, and actually &s;erved &s;everal campaigns, in vindication of our common rights. Nor did he once di&s;cover the lea&s;t timidity in the day of battle.</P>
<P>Since the re&s;toration of peace, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of our independency, he, like another Daniel, has been anxious to know the future condition of his people&mdash;and what may be the con&s;equences of a revolution &s;o extraordinary in it&s;elf &mdash;which is the wonder of the pre&s;ent, and will probably be the joy of many &s;ucceeding generations.</P>
<P>Often mu&s;ing on this delightful &s;ubject, he was at la&s;t in|dulged with an agreeable vi&s;ion, which gave him the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction. This, as related by him&s;elf, is faithfully recorded in the following pages.</P>
<P>Having walked out on a &s;ummer's evening, and grown weary, I &s;at down on the verdant bank of a neighbouring &s;tream, leaning again&s;t a tree, who&s;e &s;preading branches &s;hel|tered me from the &s;olar blaze. In this ea&s;y po&s;ture, I was awhile delighted with the mu&s;ic of the groves. The mur|muring waters below, and chirping birds,&mdash;together with the &s;ighing gales above, &s;oothed my imagination, and by degrees, lulled every ungrateful care to re&s;t; 'till, in &s;hort, I fell into a kind of drow&s;y trance.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t thus di&s;&s;olved in &s;lumberous indolence, lo, to my apprehen&s;ion, a wondrous form darting from the &s;ky &s;wift as
<PB N="6" REF="044690_0005_10213E8747D59D80">
the lightning's fla&s;h, &s;tood before me.&mdash;His countenance &s;parkled like the morning-&s;tar: And his robes out&s;hone the glowing brilliancy of the rainbow. All nature &s;eemed to &s;mile at his approach.&mdash;The hills and vales rejoiced together; and the trees of the wood clapped their hands.&mdash;I indeed, was at fir&s;t &s;mitten with a trembling awe, as in the pre&s;ence of &s;o &s;uperior a being. But perceiving an ineffable &s;weetne&s;s in his looks, and nothing vindictive in his a&s;pect; this at length recovered my dejected &s;pirit&mdash;&s;o that I ventured to acco&s;t him with words to this effect; and was kindly an|&s;wered as in the &s;equel.</P>

<P>Good Angel! For &s;uch I am convinced you are, may I know your errand? What &s;trange cau&s;e could induce you to leave the man&s;ions of light, and conde&s;cend to vi&s;it this wretched, fallen, and offending world?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Angel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s is, to re&s;olve certain doubts with which you have been lately puzzled, and to give you intelligence re&s;pecting &s;everal as yet unknown events, whereby, you and others may be comforted, and encou|raged to &s;tand fa&s;t in a re&s;olute attachment to the glorious cau&s;e of truth, and the inviolable intere&s;t of American free|dom and independency.</P>

<SPEAKER>Angel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inquire not after my name, for it is &s;ecret&mdash;but, as to my pre&s;ent &s;tation, I belong to a bright &s;quadron of Seraphic warriors, who are appointed as guardians of the&s;e confederated States.&mdash;We in&s;pired your &s;tate&s;men with wi&s;|dom, and your heroes with courage, in all their late gallant &s;truggles for freedom.&mdash;We baffled the coun&s;els of your enemies, and &s;truck terror into their hearts; in&s;omuch, that they often fled without any vi&s;ible pur&s;uer&mdash;Yet were we but generous in&s;truments at mo&s;t. God him&s;elf was the &s;upreme agent.&mdash;He it was, that &s;ucceeded your enterpri&s;es: and at la&s;t, crowned your combined forces with victory.&mdash;Without his ble&s;&s;ing, neither men nor angels could have &s;aved America, from the rapacious jaws of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. To him therefore, let all the glory be a&s;cribed for ever.</P>

<P>Her &s;o doing was in every view, a mo&s;t equitable tran&s;action.&mdash;That once flouri&s;hing kingdom, having reached the zenith of temporal grandeur, has been &s;everal years on the decline.&mdash;Britain was once indeed, a land of patriots and heroes. But now alas! The majority of her &s;ons are lament|ably degenerated. In days of old, what zealous advocates for freedom were they!&mdash;The very name of bondage made the whole nation &s;tart, as at the &s;ight of an infernal gho&s;t!&mdash; But of late they &s;eem determined as by &s;ome &s;trange fatality, to introduce an arbitrary and de&s;potic government&mdash;a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to which, is the reproach of rea&s;on, and a &s;candal to humanity. It was therefore, the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of the&s;e States to re&s;olve on an entire &s;eparation; as from a family deeply infected with the plague. Even the law of &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation required it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celadon.</SPEAKER>
<P>And may not our legi&s;lators al&s;o, follow their example? Allured by the &s;plendid baits of lucre and ambi|tion, will they not hereafter a&s;pire to ab&s;olute &s;overeignty them&s;elves? Should that be the ca&s;e, we have no great rea&s;on to triumph. It would only be changing one imperious lord for another. A doleful recompence that, for the rivers of blood we have &s;pilt, and the millions of gold we have &s;pent.</P>
<P>Tyranny will always prove the &s;ame in&s;atiable, &s;anguinary, cruel mon&s;ter, in whatever &s;hape &s;he appears; and in what|ever part of the globe &s;he reigns&punc;</P>

<SPEAKER>Angel.</SPEAKER>
<P>All &s;ublunary things are &s;ubject to mutation. The greate&s;t empires have had their birth, their growth, their maturity, and their fall. Nor can America, &s;hould the world &s;tand long enough, expect an exemption from the u&s;ual vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune.&mdash;Yet, &s;uch a change is not likely to happen very &s;oon.&mdash;A republic being compo&s;ed of many parts, is not &s;o liable to en&s;laving mea&s;ures, as monarchies in general are.&mdash;The States will doubtle&s;s watch over one ano|ther with the &s;tricte&s;t vigilance. So that no gro&s;s innovation can long lie concealed, but mu&s;t &s;oon be di&s;covered and detected, by that matchle&s;s &s;agacity with which this country is di&s;tingui&s;hed&mdash;and is indeed, one of your peculiar cha|racteri&s;tics as a nation. May you never forfeit it, by wilfully &s;hutting your eyes again&s;t the truth, as too many others have done!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celadon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet &s;hould &s;ome foreign power, ca&s;t an avarici|ous eye on our fertile fields, and blooming fore&s;ts, how could
<PB N="8" REF="044690_0007_10213E6691F93628">
we repel the encroachment? Should they invade our territo|ries in their infancy, and before our con&s;titution is well &s;et|tled, might we not be reduced to the ba&s;e&s;t va&s;&s;alage after all?&mdash;A burnt child dreads even the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of fire!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Angel.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you live in amity and concord, there can be no danger of that calamity; e&s;pecially if you join to &s;uppre&s;s vice, and encourage virtue.&mdash;Whil&s;t you labour to wor&s;hip God in &s;incerity, and promote the intere&s;t of religion and morality, you need fear no external enemy; nor dread any ho&s;tile inva&s;ion.&mdash;Your country is &s;o &s;ituated, that it would prove very difficult, if not morally &s;peaking, impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;ubdue it by outward force.&mdash;It needs no artificial bulwark, or &s;umptuous fortification.&mdash;Nature it&s;elf, has made it im|pregnable.&mdash;And which is much more: As long as you retain your integrity, the Lord of Ho&s;ts will be with you; the God of Jacob will be your refuge.&mdash;Nothing can ruin America, but the degeneracy of her own offspring.&mdash;Beware of that, and you may be ea&s;y on all other accounts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celadon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good news! But, may not the now United States differ among them&s;elves! Should they hereafter quarrel with one another, it would certainly be to their mutual injury. Yea, perhaps, prove de&s;tructive to the whole empire.&mdash;Di|vide, and overthrow them, is Satan's maxim&mdash;the ancient logic of that malignant &s;pirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Angel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should they do &s;o, they mu&s;t blame them&s;elves for their own perdition. And like &s;elf-murderers, die contemned; and be buried in the horrid vaults of infamy.&mdash;But, this is not likely to happen, without &s;ome great, and general depravity of manners.&mdash;Seeing each State is of it&s;elf independent, as to its own internal juri&s;diction; and enjoys all the immunities it can de&s;ire as a di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tantive commonwealth; what ground can there be for jealou&s;y or emulation, for envy or bickerment between them?&mdash;The&s;e atrocious fiends will, 'tis hoped, never prevail in this new and flouri&s;hing continent. On the contrary, the inhabitants daily ta&s;ting the delicious &s;weets of equal freedom, will, you may tru&s;t my word, be more and more united, and join as one mighty champion to maintain the tranquility of the whole community.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celadon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should this be our propitious lot, we &s;hall pro|bably increa&s;e in number very fa&s;t. Which will by con&s;e|quence, augment our warlike force&punc; and be a continual ad|dition
<PB N="9" REF="044690_0008_10213E8A5C1C3678">
to our national &s;trength. So that by a long cour&s;e of pro&s;perity, we may become as the &s;and on the &s;ea &s;hore for multitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Angel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Multiply you doubtle&s;s will; and that to a prodigy. To this, not only your own fruitfulne&s;s, but continual emi|gration from &s;everal parts of the world will annually contri|bute.&mdash;The poor, the oppre&s;&s;ed, and the per&s;ecuted will fly to America as doves to their windows.&mdash;This We&s;tern-World will be the dernier re&s;ort, the la&s;t refuge, and a&s;ylum for afflicted merit.&mdash;Nor will room be wanting. This con|tinent is the large&s;t, and will be the mo&s;t populous empire upon earth: Provided, the pride and luxury of the inhabi|tants, do not prove an ob&s;tacle to its growth.&mdash;Of all &s;uch enormities therefore, they will do well timely to beware: which, as hi&s;tory informs you, have in pa&s;t ages, &s;apped the foundations of, and laid the mo&s;t opulent and powerful &s;tates in ruins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celadon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven grant they ever may! But alas! The relentle&s;s Indians are &s;till ravaging our helple&s;s frontiers. Their perpetual depredations will, 'tis feared, greatly retard the population of our as yet woodland regions. The related horrors of their &s;calping ma&s;&s;acres, have hitherto prevented not a few in their de&s;igns of removing thither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Angel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That impediment is not likely to la&s;t very long. Their ammunition will &s;oon be &s;pent. Nor can their game la&s;t many years.&mdash;The deer, buffalo, &amp;c. will gradually grow &s;carce; and at la&s;t fail of cour&s;e.&mdash;So that in conclu&s;ion, they will find them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of working, or &s;tarving. &mdash;Hunger will compel them to &s;ue for peace. They will ap|ply to Congre&s;s for an a&s;&s;ured &s;ettlement of their own, which being granted, they will betake them&s;elves to hone&s;t labour; and by indu&s;try in due time become a polite, wealthy, and pious nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celadon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pious! And will &s;uch &s;avages ever be converted to Chri&s;tianity! When at pre&s;ent, they &s;eem to be implacable enemies to the name of Chri&s;t!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Angel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may be a&s;&s;ured of it.&mdash;Why this paroxi&s;m of admiration? Your progenitors, the now refined Britons, were formerly as wild Pagans, as rank Idolaters, and as aver&s;e to embracing the go&s;pel as the Indians now are.&mdash; Remember, it is God's work to convert men. Divine power
<PB N="10" REF="044690_0009_10213E6F0F319A48">
can do every thing.&mdash;And time may produce yet greater won|ders. Every operation is alike ea&s;y to omnipotence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Celadon.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is to be done with the poor Negroes? Nothing! There are va&s;t crouds of them in &s;ome States.&mdash; And is not their rigorous &s;ervitude an odious blot in our &s;cutcheon of honor?&mdash;Wretched creatures! Mu&s;t they alone remain in irrevocable bondage? I hope not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Angel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they too, &s;hall in the proper &s;ea&s;on be &s;et at liberty.&mdash;A tract of land will be allowed them.&mdash;They &s;hall be furni&s;hed with implements of hu&s;bandry, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary to begin the world with.&mdash;They will by degrees form a State of their own.&mdash;And at length al&s;o, prove a rich, a religious, and u&s;eful people. But there mu&s;t be time for their manumi&s;&s;ion. It cannot be done at once.</P>
</SP>
<P>Thus &s;aying the Angel as I thought, took me up in his arms, and in an in&s;tant &s;et me down again on the top of an exceeding high mountain.&mdash;This mountain &s;tands in the cen|tre of North-America; and for altitude &s;urmounts all others. &mdash;It is in figure like a broken globe. And for circumference about thirteen geographical miles.&mdash;This &s;tately ridge &s;eems to claim the monarchy of the atlantic hills: Being crowned with an ever glowing verdure.&mdash;The trees which adorn its towering &s;ummit, are clad with unfading green.&mdash;Cedar, pine, laurel, &amp;c. are the principal product of the irriguous &s;oil. It put me in mind of the famous Helicon, &s;o often celebrated by the poets, as the native re&s;idence of the mu&s;es.&mdash;E&s;pecial|ly, as I perceived &s;everal limpid &s;prings bur&s;ting from its &s;ides, and flowing in fertilizing meanders through the circum|jacent plains, and refre&s;hing the vales below.&mdash;I &s;tood on a large rock, placed about the middle of the mountain; and &s;omewhat higher than any other part of it. This &s;tone too is of a circular form, and makes a beautiful appearance; for it looks like poli&s;hed marble.</P>
<P>Then the Angel wa&s;hed my eyes with a cry&s;taline elixir, which he carried in a pearly phial. Whereupon I found my vi&s;ive faculty amazingly &s;trengthened: So that I could di&s;|tinctly view the whole continent from &s;hore to &s;hore.</P>
<P>This done, he bid me turn to the ea&s;t. I did &s;o. And looking from north to &s;outh, what a grand and maje&s;tic pro&s;pect was pre&s;ented to my &s;ight!</P>
<P>Several &s;pacious cities, and a great many thriving towns already founded.&mdash;What a thick conjunction of farms,
<PB N="11" REF="044690_0010_10213E8D7B950958">
plantations, gardens, orchards, vineyards, &amp;c. laden with every kind of fruit!&mdash;How charmingly diver&s;ified with lofty hills, and flowery dales! Exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, and &s;hady groves! How plentifully watered with living fountains, purling rills, and navigable rivers throughout the whole; for fifteen hun|dred miles in length, and near a thou&s;and in breadth!&mdash;And what elegant buildings adapted to all the purpo&s;es of life, both civil and religious!&mdash;I &s;tood, and gazed with plea&s;ing a&s;to|ni&s;hment, till the Angel ordered me to turn my face we&s;tward. I obeyed, and was equally &s;urpri&s;ed at the wide extended land&s;cape.</P>
<P>This we&s;tern part of America, is as yet but an uncultivated de&s;art; the haunt of &s;avages; and range of wild bea&s;ts.&mdash;But the &s;oil in general is much richer than that of the ea&s;tern divi|&s;ion. The rivers too, are larger, and flow in greater numbers. The mountains indeed are numerous, and very high: Yet between them lie exceeding wide and level vallies; and to ap|pearance fertile as the plains of Shinar, which they &s;ay, u&s;ed to yield an hundred fold. I al&s;o perceived, that the &s;ettled part of our continent, is really but a little &s;pot in compari&s;on of the va&s;t regions to whitemen as yet unknown.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, lo&s;t in wonder I could not avoid falling into this agreeable reflection, whil&s;t &s;urveying a beauteous world ri&s;ing out of a dreary wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>It is as yet, &s;carce three hundred years &s;ince this quarter of the globe was fir&s;t di&s;covered by the European nations. Nor is above one hundred years elap&s;ed, &s;ince any con&s;ider|able improvements have been made in this northern conti|nent. Yet at this day it contains by computation, at lea&s;t three millions of Chri&s;tain inhabitants; be&s;ide the heatheni&s;h tribes. Of whom there is perhaps, a much greater number than are yet regi&s;tered in our accounts of tho&s;e formidable warriors.&mdash;How rapid mu&s;t have been the growth of my native country! When in that &s;hort &s;pace of time, it has ari&s;en to &s;uch a degree of wealth and grandeur, as to be able not only to cope with, but to bid defiance to Great-Britain it&s;elf. A power, which for ages pa&s;t, was renowned for military prowe&s;s; and famous for victory and triumph.&mdash; Ble&s;&s;ed art thou O America! Thou &s;halt both do great things, and &s;halt &s;till prevail!</Q></P>
<P>How long I might have remained in this contemplative rap|ture I cannot tell, had not the Angel recalled my attention by
<PB N="12" REF="044690_0011_10213E91802742C8">
a gentle touch on my &s;ide, and pointing his finger a little to the &s;outh-we&s;t, Celadon, &s;ays he, do you &s;ee yonder long valley.&mdash;How full of the choice&s;t timber! What fine &s;prings it contains! And how many perennial rivers glide through it, at &s;uitable di&s;tances!&mdash;That whole region you may call Savagenia: It being de&s;igned for the future habitation of your now trouble&s;ome Indians.&mdash;And that other valley; it is you may notice, as well wooded, and watered, and every way furni&s;hed with all the preparative accommodations for human life, as the fir&s;t I &s;hewed you. It lies toward the north-we&s;t; and enjoys of the two, the cleare&s;t air; and by con&s;equence, will prove the healthie&s;t climate.&mdash;This you may call Nigrania: It being allotted for the Negroes to dwell there, when the term of their va&s;&s;alage is come to a period.&mdash;And in all tho&s;e va&s;t &s;paces we&s;tward to the great ocean, there may be &s;eats here|after for &s;undry foreign nations.&mdash;There may be a French, a Spani&s;h, a Dutch, an Iri&s;h, an Engli&s;h, &amp;c. yea, a Jewi&s;h State here in proce&s;s of time.&mdash;And all of them united in bro|therly affection, will at la&s;t form the mo&s;t potent empire on the face of the earth.</P>

<P>Thrice happy event! The Lord ha&s;ten it.
