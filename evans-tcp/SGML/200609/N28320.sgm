<P>Not so.</P>

<P>You forget that you have sons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sons! and what then? Fool that I was, to mur|mur against Providence, eighteen years ago, for sending me a daughter. I wanted sons. Wild, careless fellows. I thought they would be more easily provided for, and make their way better through the world. Yes, yes, they make their way through it, and leave their poor father in the lurch. There is Samuel&mdash;</P>

<P><STAGE>[With much emotion.]</STAGE>

<P>He loves you so tenderly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. John.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the distance of more than a thousand miles, I would not give a fig for his love. There he cruizes upon unknown oceans, from one quarter of the world to another; while the gout is cruizing through all my limbs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Liddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, it is only for your sake he exposes himself to so many hardships. Perhaps he will now soon be back again. I look every morning how the wind blows; and, should he return with a rich cargo? Should he change our present poverty into opulence? Look only, dear father, this is in the power of a son to do; while the daughter must sit at home, and can do nothing but take care of her sick father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that is more than if Robert should bring me the luxuries of both Indies. Good Liddy, when the gentle eye converses so tenderly with me; I cannot describe to you, how much it does me good. You will think often that your father slumbers, when I sit upon my chair with my eyes closed! No, Liddy, your father then prays for you.</P>
</SP>

<P>What a sweet reward is in this moment.

<P>Who is to blame? Is it not your mother? Who torments me from breakfast-time to the hour of supper? Who is it, that throws my unmerited bankruptcy in my teeth, with every scanty morsel that I eat? Who despises my good burgher's blood, and talks so big of her German ancestors? Who is it that suffers me to starve? Who talks our tenants out of their money, and squanders so idly the slender rents which the possession of these houses has still left me? Did you not hear how I petitioned last night for a pipe of tobacco, and a pot of porter? Samuel carried your mother to the play-house; and I was obliged to send my appetite to sleep.</P>

<SPEAKER>S. John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Liddy, I will stay here in the parlour; for yonder the scolding tongue of your mother would drive all sleep from my eyes; besides, of what consequence is it?

Kaberdar, whom I sneaked after in all haste, went from one merchant to another, and procured full information of the circumstan|ces. He heard every where, that Brown and Belton were men of fine honest characters; who, by means of several un|merited misfortunes, had fallen into this desperate situation.
<PB N="20" REF="037748_0020_100EFECDAD341CF0">
What does he? He sets himself down with the greatest pre|cipitation, and writes immediately to Brown and Belton, a card to the following purpose: "If ten thousand pounds sterling would be sufficient to extricate ye from your present perplexity, ye are welcome to the loan of that sum, with|out interest for six months."&mdash;Brown and Belton, who had never set eyes upon the man in their lives, are almost be|side themselves with astonishment and rapture, honor their bills, and carry on their business with all their former prompt|ness and expedition; and venerate an East Indian as much as a saint.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samuel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I but once his son-in-law, the mist of these foolish fancies should soon give place to the sun of reason. I will soon prove to him that a cow has no more claim to his veneration than an ass: I will prove to him, that neither at new nor full moon, neither in the first nor last quarter, is it permitted by prudence to give alms. In short, if the pur|chase of Rogers-hall be clear, then will my marriage with Gurli be clear also. Farewel, in the mean time, my dear Oificer. Be indefatigable, zealous and active: but above all things be cautious: keep your five senses at all times upon the watch.

<STAGE>[Creeps to Sir John's door, and lays his ear to the key-hole.]</STAGE>
I hear a great noise at a distance, like hail beating upon a decayed roof.&mdash;No, no, it is the voice of our mistress.&mdash;These damned Canary birds cry so loud, that one cannot make out one Syllable plainly.&mdash;Quickly, quickly.

Here all is silent as the grave.&mdash;No: Gurli hums a song.&mdash;Her singing may be exceedingly good, but it does not satisfy my curi|osity.
<STAGE>[Runs back to the other door.]</STAGE>
Here all is now quiet as a mouse.&mdash;Now Miss Liddy begins to speak.&mdash;Now the devil has stirred up these damned Canary birds again&mdash;I cannot endure the vermin: as soon as she speaks one word aloud, then they all cry along with her.

who I am. Not a heart in England has yet participated with me in the secret of my rank and sufferings. I was born on the banks of the Ganges, and in the bosom of feli|city; brought up by my uncle the sovereign of Mysore, a man of honor, whose throne and whose enemies I fell heir to. I was then scarcely sixteen years of age. They gave me wives, because custom would have it so: and by the time I was twenty, I saw myself already the father of five sons and a daughter. I was happy, for I was beloved by my people, and esteemed both by the French and English; and dreaded by all my enemies and neighbours; peace reigned in my kingdom and in my palace. I was happy then&mdash;thanks be to Providence. Man is ever blind to fu|turity. That I was cherishing serpents in my bosom; that my own brothers were conspiring against my crown and my life; and scattering the seeds of rebellion among my sub|jects, was never once suspected by my credulous heart. At last the conspiracy broke out; the sceptre of Mysore was torn in one unhappy night from my hand; and also, my wives and my sons became the prey of the sanguinary victor. Only I with my daughter, and an old faithful servant, were so fortunate, after a thousand dangers, to reach at last the sea-coast. There lay two English ships just ready to set sail; one of which received us, weighed anchor, and brought us to Liddy's native land. If Liddy will restore to me what I have lost, then shall this be the last sigh which I will ever send after the happiness that is gone.</P>

<SPEAKER>Liddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, in the name of my future spouse, I prohibit all such titles of honor; and in the second place, as to what concerns your benevolent anxiety for Gurli, you have only to speak a good word to her step mother, if you should incline to make any advances.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gurli.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! dear Liddy! that Gurli knows not yet. Be|lieve me, it is a very stupid business&mdash;my father thinks yes, and Gurli thinks yes too; but it seems to me, as if Gurli wanted to pluck a pisang fruit; and there grows not a pi|sang in all England.

Gurli wanted to marry Liddy; but her father says, that will not do&mdash; Gurli wanted to marry Musaffery; but Musaffery says, that it will not do.</P>

<P>Certainly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gurli.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! yes, that would be charming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samuel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What think you then, Miss, could you, for exam|ple, be persuaded to love and to marry me?</P>

<P>I must tell thee plainly, dear Liddy, that Gurli does not yet know properly, what sort of a thing marriage is.</P>

<SPEAKER>Liddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have thought, brother, that for this time at least, you might have kept your caution to yourself, and taken her at her word, before she had leisure to form ano|ther opinion upon the subject.</P>

<SPEAKER>Samuel.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that I can possibly do, is as follows: I will go to one notary, and then to another; and appoint them both to come hither this afternoon.</P>

<P>Both! why then must there be two?</P>

Laugh as you please; I have only one ques|tion to ask: can such matters be too prudently managed? answer: no. I shall go, and appoint them both, cause them both to draw up a contract, compare them both, correct them both, and chuse with proper caution one from them both. In the mean while, fair bride!

My good friend, said you to him, this is a hard piece of work. That it is, gave he for answer, and wiped off the sweat with the palm of his hand. One question produced another. We asked him, how he was able to smile so contentedly at his hard fortune? He then pointed to a thicket a few paces off; under the thicket sat a black woman, with three little, half naked children, the youngest of whom was upon her breast. And while the ne|gro was pointing with his finger, he looked so delighted with

<P>Hold, hold! not so hasty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kaberdar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss, I now release you from your promise.&mdash; Father and son stand here before you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Liddy.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[In astonishment.]</STAGE>
Father and son!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kaberdar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, this youth is my son.&mdash;He loves you&mdash;I love you too.&mdash;Make your choice freely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gurli.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[To Liddy.]</STAGE>
Take the son; he is handsomer than the father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kaberdar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your heart must pronounce the sentence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Liddy.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[In great perplexity.]</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fazir.</SPEAKER>

Dear Miss!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sister, will you not decide?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Liddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can I? I have already given my promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kaberdar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had not then given your promise, would you not?

I understand you.

<SPEAKER>Kaberdar.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Wiping a tear from his eyes.]</STAGE>
One single drop of bitterness! quite right: the cup of pleasure was too sweet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Jack, what think you now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think that I shall now be obliged to cruise about the world by myself, with this old ruinous vessel. All my powder and lead is spent; my provisions are exhausted; and what will become of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall stay with me; and so long as I have a biscuit to myself, I shall always make you welcome to the half of it, till you finish your voyage happily at last, and cast anchor in the latitude of Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Sir, I thank you: and I wish all of you, fair wind and weather for your voyage.</P>
