<HEAD>THE UNFORTUNATE LOVERS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1666, Mr. Benjamin Beaumont and Mr. Samuel Gauze, were partners in mercantile concerns in the town of Bo&s;ton.&mdash;They were not related, but lived in perfect friend&s;hip. They were men of the fir&s;t charac|ters in town, and had a rapid run of bu&s;ine&s;s, both the whole&s;ale and retail, by which they accumulated great property. At length Mr. Beaumont got married, and his partner, Mr. Gauze, in the &s;pace of three months afterwards. Notwith&s;tanding they lived in perfect friend|&s;hip for the term of three months, then by mu|tual con&s;ent of both parties, di&s;&s;olved partner|&s;hip; but &s;till had a good under&s;tanding. How|ever, at the end of nine months, Mr. Beau|mont was favored with a hand&s;ome boy; and on account of the love and good will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Mr. Gauze, invited him in (as their hou&s;es were adjoining) to make merry with him on the occa&s;ion. Dinner being over, Mr. Beaumont and Mr. Gauze, retired into a private room for amu&s;ement. After conver&s;|ing upon different topics, Mr. Beaumont turns to Mr. Gauze, with a joyful countenance, &s;aying, if it was &s;o ordered by Deity, that your wife &s;hould bring forth a daughter, &s;o that their tender minds might be filled with love and
<PB N="4" REF="036045_0004_10080B8ACD155D80">
gratitude towards each other from their youth up to the age of maturity, and then be joined in the bands of wedlock&mdash;with all my heart, replied Mr. Gauze, God grant that to be the ca&s;e. With that they renewed it by a &s;olemn vow, that nothing would be wanted on their part, to endear them to each other. And they had their wi&s;h; for &s;carcely had three months revolved, when Mrs. Gauze was delivered of a hand&s;ome daughter. Then Mr. Beaumont was &s;ent for to make merry on the occa&s;ion; where they renewed their former promi&s;es, and con|firmed it with a &s;olemn oath. At the end of a year, the children were baptized. The boy, Samuel Beaumont, and the girl, Nancy Gauze&mdash;in memory of Mrs. Beaumont. And when old enough to go to &s;chool, were &s;ent to &s;chool together, and all the pains imaginable taken, to endear them to each other: Mr. Beaumont would often &s;ay, Samuel, if you go any where to day, you mu&s;t go with Mi&s;s Nancy; And Mr. Gauze would frequently &s;ay, Nancy, be &s;ure and call for Samuel, when going to &s;chool to-day.</P>
<P>Thus a few days had elap&s;ed, when they be|came attached to each other to &s;uch a degree, that it was beyond the art of human rea&s;on to keep them apart for any length of time. How|ever, Samuel was &s;ent to College at the age of fourteen, which proved very grievous to Nan|cy, and brought her immediately into a &s;tate of de&s;pondent melancholy. But their parents indulged them as much as po&s;&s;ible, by the pri|vilege of frequent vi&s;its, and by unfolding their minds to each other by letters.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="036045_0005_10080BA47A90D410">
During the time of Samuel's collegiate life, his father (Mr. Beaumont) was deeply engag|ed in the Ea&s;t India trade, which proved &s;o unfortunate, by &s;torms at &s;ea, that he lo&s;t all his &s;hipping, and in le&s;s than one month after his &s;on took his degree, his creditors called upon him and found him unable to pay ten &s;hil|lings on the pound. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;udden and unfortunate change, he bore it with the greate&s;t fortitude.</P>
<P>Now let us turn to the young lovers, who were encouraged by indulgent parents.</P>
<P>By this time their pa&s;&s;ions became more &s;trong. As they increa&s;ed in years, Cupid's arrows were implanted &s;trongly in both their brea&s;ts; and they lived in as much love and unity, &s;ave the nuptial bed, as tho' bound by the tendere&s;t ties of a nature. But pride, rank pride, the de&s;troyer of peace and happine&s;s, &s;oon made a &s;eparation: For Gauze, finding his intended &s;on-in-law (Mr. Beaumont, as his age gives him the title) reduced to poverty by the mi&s;fortunes of his honored father, denies him the privilege of coming to his hou&s;e or paying any further re&s;pects to his daughter. This refu&s;al was &s;o &s;udden and unexpected, that he remained &s;peechle&s;s for &s;ome minutes. At length he exclaimed, with a loud and bitter cry&mdash;In the name of ju&s;tice, from what motives have you altered your mind! This is beyond my conception, to have an open denial of the privileges you always indulged me in, even from my infancy. Oh! Good heavens! is it po&s;&s;ible for us to part, who have been &s;o long, united, and have been taught by indulgent pa|rents
<PB N="6" REF="036045_0006_10080B8C52CA7C60">
to accent the fir&s;t words of our utter|ance, <HI>love?</HI> By this time his courage began to return, and he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to Mr. Gauze in the following manner:&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, I be&s;eech you to take a retro&s;pective view of your pa&s;t conduct re&s;pecting this un|happy affair, which appears to be &s;o at pre&s;ent. Don't you remember the &s;olemn promi&s;es that pa&s;&s;ed between you and my father, that Nancy and I &s;hould be bound by the bands of wedlock, provided we were agreed, which you know to be the ca&s;e? And not only &s;o, but you con|firmed it with an oath. I am not ignorant of this matter. This was not done in a corner; for the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people in town are well acquainted with it. Now, Sir, plea&s;e to let me know what you ever ob&s;erved in me or my conduct, to give you any rea&s;on to treat me with neglect, and deprive me of the object of my wi&s;hes, which you ever indulged me in. Mr. Gauze remains &s;peechle&s;s&mdash;at length re|plies: I have ever ob&s;erved your conduct to be good, but do not wi&s;h to have my daughter go to the arms of a beggar. Your father was in good circum&s;tances when I pa&s;&s;ed my word, which I don't con&s;ider binding, &s;ince he has been reduced to poverty.</P>
<P>The young man replied: Your riches peri&s;h with you&mdash;and departed with a heavy heart. Mi&s;s Nancy was then in her apartment, and knew nothing of the conver&s;ation; but no &s;ooner had Mr. Beaumont retired, than her fa|ther entered the room and &s;aid, I'm determin|ed to break up a &s;cene that has been long in
<PB N="7" REF="036045_0007_10080BA6E251CFF8">
agitation, both to your ruin and the di&s;honor of your father.</P>
<P>Nancy replies with a look of wildne&s;s&mdash;good God! Father, what &s;cene! what &s;cene? The &s;cene between you and Beaumont, that has been &s;o long brewing. Don't you know that his fortune is not adequate to your's? But &s;till you keep his company to the injury of your credit, as it will throw you into the meane&s;t company in town. I look upon him no better than the off<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">couring of humanity&mdash;Nancy cries forbear, I pray forbear, with her eyes brim full of tears. She could not utter more&mdash;at length recovering, &s;ays: Father, was not the fir&s;t &s;eeds of love &s;own in my tender brea&s;t by your own hand, cheri&s;hed by your in&s;inuations, and have budded and blo&s;&s;omed, and arrived to &s;uch a degree of perfection that they are pa&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">? Oh! father, how often have I heard you &s;ay, be &s;ure and go with Samuel to &s;chool to-day, when I was incapable of com|prehending your meaning: And now I mu&s;t tell you, with tears in my eyes, that nothing can part us but death. On hearing of this, her father interrupted her, and &s;aid: You are un|der my commands, and to them you mu&s;t &s;ub|mit</P>
<P>Her mother, who remained in tears during the time of their conver&s;ation, addre&s;&s;ed Mr. Gauze in the following manner:</P>
<P><HI>[Nancy retires.]</HI></P>
<P>You know that &s;he is our child who is near <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> dear to us, and why will you undertake to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> her ruin by &s;eparating her from her <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> held dear. Your con&s;cience mu&s;t certainly tell
<PB N="8" REF="036045_0008_10080B8ECA7A01C0">
you that &s;he is not the aggre&s;&s;or, for &s;he has obeyed your commands from her youth up to this day; and why will you &s;tifle flame which was your's, and your partner, Mr. Beaumont's concupi&s;cible motives. With that, Mr. Gauze replied. You talk like one of the fooli&s;h wo|men; you would bring the family under an ev|erlating di&s;grace by joining her to a man that is &s;o poor. Then let her be poor, &s;ays Mrs. Gauze&mdash;I would rather &s;ee her happy than rich; but there is no need of her being poor; your intere&s;t is great; be&s;tow a part up|on her. How often has it been the ca&s;e that there was not equality of property on the &s;ame occa&s;ion. Do comply with my reque&s;t; for if there is not &s;omething done &s;hortly, we mu&s;t follow her in &s;orrow to the grave. Mr. Beau|mont replies: Enough&mdash;I will hear no more&mdash;I will go this moment and confine her. He goes immediately, and engaging two maidens to attend her, confines her to the room, &s;aying, there is your place of re&s;idence till you alter your mind&mdash;then retires, charging the &s;ervants not to a&s;&s;ist her, either by letter, or verbal in|formation, on the penalty of being di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Now the unfortunate lovers are bewailing their unhappy fate in a &s;tate of &s;eparation and de&s;pair. At length her lover &s;its down and writes in the following manner:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is needle&s;s for me to inform you of the trouble that daily &s;urrounds me, as I know you to be under the &s;ame predicament, and con&s;e|quently &s;hare in each other's difficulties, unle&s;s our minds are very much altered from what
<PB N="9" REF="036045_0009_10080BA896C7C1B0">
they were in our la&s;t interview. I &s;peak from the bottom of my heart; mine is not altered, nor ever &s;hall be till &s;eparated by death. I know not what will be the event of your fa|ther's treating us with &s;o much cruelty. Time will not permit me to go into a lengthy detail of things in the pa&s;t ten&s;e, but mu&s;t mention &s;omething of a &s;erious nature, which concerns the pre&s;ent, which I hope will prove fortunate to us both, and make the remainder of our days happy. Time hangs heavy over my head &s;ince our la&s;t conver&s;ation. You cannot tell the anxiety I undergo. Sleep is departed from me. Pardon me for writing &s;o, for I am &s;o well ac|quainted with your heart that I know you &s;hare with me in my troubles. My mind is &s;o con|fu&s;ed that I have dropped the &s;ubject I meant to treat upon re&s;pecting our future happine&s;s. I have taken the matter into &s;erious contem|plation, and &s;ee no method we can take to ob|tain the object of our wi&s;hes; and I have re|&s;olved or embark for England to &s;eek my for|tune. You mu&s;t not blame me, for you know that our parents are the cau&s;e of all this&mdash;My father's poverty, and your father's pride. It is di&s;agreeable to part, but we mu&s;t bear it with fortitude&mdash;hoping in the cour&s;e of &s;ix or &s;even years to make each other happy&mdash;hoping to re|turn in that time, if life is &s;pared. My method of conveying this letter is this&mdash;I have engag|ed a boy to go this night with the letter on the end of a pole, that you may receive it at your chamber window at twelve o'clock, hoping you will &s;end me an an&s;wer at the &s;ame hour

<P>At half pa&s;t eleven, the boy appears to re|ceive his me&s;&s;age, which he conveyed in the following manner: On approaching the win|dow, he tapped it gently with the pole three or four times unnoticed.&mdash;Mi&s;s Nancy lay mu|&s;ing on her bed.

You know my &s;ituation here as to pro|perty, and to the anxiety of my mind it is be&s;t known to my&s;elf&mdash;I am not de&s;titute of feelings, and tho&s;e of the tendere&s;t nature. It is hard parting with parents who have brought me up &s;o tenderly, and have cultivated my mind in the days of my youth, by giving me good edu|cation, which will remain with me when my property is all exhau&s;ted; which is the ca&s;e with us both: this he &s;peaks with tears, &s;aying, it is hard and cutting to human nature, to be once in affluent circum&s;tances, and then reduc|ed
<PB N="12" REF="036045_0012_10080B9416C37BF0">
to poverty: And how to procure money to perform my journey I know not.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>His parents, who were in tears all this time, knew not what to &s;ay. At length his father an&s;wered: My &s;on, I know your &s;ituation is bad, as well as my own: I have given you a good education, and was under circum&s;tances to have given you a hand&s;ome fortune; but if it was the will of Providence that we &s;hould come to poverty, let us not repine, but be content. If it is your determination to go in que&s;t of a fortune, I will procure money &s;ufficient of my brother to bear your expences, (which he did) and in the cour&s;e of three days was ready to &s;ail. Previous to his embarcation, there came three gentlemen merchants to his father's, and talked with him, on the nece&s;&s;ity of his being very attentive to his bu&s;ine&s;s; and as they were acquainted in London, gave him letters of re|commendation to the merchants; which he re|ceived with a heart of gratitude and thankful|ne&s;s. Next morning he took his leave of his parents and a large circle of acquaintance, and &s;et fail.</P>
<P>Now let us turn to the parents of the unfor|tunate lovers.</P>
<P>Mr. Gauze hearing of his embarcation, im|mediately relea&s;es his daughter from her con|finement, who had the privilege of walking out: Her mind being perplexed, and being confined &s;o long, &s;he ran eagerly to unfold her heart to Mrs. Beaumont. Her father, hearing of this, run in ha&s;te to fru&s;trate her plan. No &s;ooner had he entered the door, than he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Beaumont. Mr. Gauze exclaimed with a
<PB N="13" REF="036045_0013_10080BAEA53037C8">
peremptory tone of voice: Who gave you the liberty of harboring my daughter? Mr. Beau|mont an&s;wered him with a great degree of calmne&s;s: She is not your daughter, for you have given her to my &s;on in her infancy, and confirmed it by a &s;olemn oath, which has pro|ved their ruin. Mr. Gauze an&s;wers: Would you have my daughter go to the arms of a beg|gar? You have ventured your property and lo&s;t it, and by that means broke up the match. It never was my intention to have them joined unle&s;s there was an equality of property. Mr. Beaumont replies: Your property peri&s;h with you&mdash;it never gave ea&s;e to a perjured &s;oul. Go home and contemplate on the former pro|mi&s;es that pa&s;&s;ed betwixt us, re&s;pecting the hap|pine&s;s of the young couple you have lately &s;e|parated. I have ever treated you with bene|volence, but you have treated me with ingrati|tude, which is the blacke&s;t of crimes.</P>
<P>Mr. Gauze and his daughter returns very &s;olitary. Mr. Beaumont arrives in England, after a tedious pa&s;&s;age of twelve weeks, and &s;uffered every thing but death it&s;elf. On his arrival in London, one of the fir&s;t characters, who was deeply engaged in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t India trade, employed him as fir&s;t clerk of the counting room. He remained in this &s;ituation for the term of one year; gave perfect &s;atis|faction, and treated every man with politene&s;s, but never appeared to &s;mile: which was ob|&s;erved by his employer, who one day took an opportunity to a&s;k him, &s;aying, What is the cau&s;e of your dejection? Are you not treated hand&s;omely by your fellow clerks? Or have I
<PB N="14" REF="036045_0014_10080B9655861608">
given you any rea&s;on for this heavine&s;s of heart! Mr. Beaumont replies with tears: You have ever been my friend and brother according to the bonds of &s;ociety. My &s;ickne&s;s is of the mind. I cannot carry &s;miles and &s;un&s;hine in my face when di&s;content &s;its heavy on my heart&mdash;His employer replies: May I know the cau&s;e without intruding too far? To you alone I will reveal it, as I know you have a heart that will ever conceal, and a tongue that will never re|veal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> then gives him a narrative of all his misfortunes. His employer heard him with a&s;toni&s;hment, and with a heart full of grati|tude, an&s;wers him in the following manner: You have pa&s;&s;ed through many &s;cenes of diffi|culty in your youthful days, but I hope it will all terminate for the be&s;t. My bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;uch that I want your a&s;&s;i&s;tance for years to come; but I will not require it any longer than it will terminate for your health and happine&s;s. I would advi&s;e you to take a journey to France for your health, as new objects are commenda|ble for a per&s;son in your &s;ituation. I will give you letters of recommendation to &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in France, which I pre&s;ume will introduce you into bu&s;ine&s;s. Furthermore, I will help you to money to bear your expences. Mr. Beaumont immediately complied with his offer, and in three days from that time, em|barked for France: But misfortune &s;eemed to await him: For within a few leagues of the de&s;ired haven, the ve&s;&s;el was ca&s;taway, and on|ly he and two others had the good fortune to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Now his cup of calamities was entirely full.
<PB N="15" REF="036045_0015_10080BB029DA89E0">
He was left wholly de&s;titute of money. His letters of recommendation were gone, and in fact, every thing but what was on his back. Being ca&s;t on a de&s;olate i&s;land, it made his &s;itu|ation &s;till more de&s;perate. But his comrades, being endowed with a great &s;hare of fortitude, &s;et out in que&s;t of inhabitants; and in twenty four hours came to a coffee hou&s;e, where they told their misfortunes and got &s;ome refre&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>Mr. Beaumont thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to en|quire for bu&s;ine&s;s of a public nature, on ac|count of the lo&s;s of his recommendations, but enquired of the landlord for &s;ome private em|ployment.</P>
<P>Sir, replied his ho&s;t, you do not appear to me like a man brought up to &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;Your addre&s;s and conver&s;ation &s;peaketh differ|ent.</P>
<P>Mr. Beaumont an&s;wered with a blu&s;h: Ne|ce&s;&s;ity is the mother of invention.</P>
<P>His ho&s;t replied: There is a Nobleman three miles di&s;tant who employs a great number of &s;ervants, but is &s;omething &s;ingular in his treat|ment towards them. He never gives any abu&s;e; for when one breaks a law, he is imme|diately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the next lowe&s;t is rai&s;ed to his &s;tation.</P>
<P>His regulations I am plea&s;ed with, &s;aid Mr. Beaumont.</P>
<P>He will be here this evening replied his ho&s;t.</P>
<P>Accordingly he appeared &amp; made an agree|ment. He &s;erved him with all the faithfulne&s;s and &s;tability imaginable, and declared, that
<PB N="16" REF="036045_0016_10080B98092F5D38">
when he was cleaning knives, his mind was mo&s;t at ea&s;e: For when he was not employed, and no kind of bu&s;ine&s;s called his attention, his thoughts were in Bo&s;ton, placed with the deep|e&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on his beloved. And no &s;ooner had night &s;pread her fable curtain, than his mind was filled with anxiety; and often on his bed he would commune with him&s;elf, &s;aying, The limited time of my ab&s;ence will &s;hortly be expired, and how &s;hall I accompli&s;h my de&s;ign. I mu&s;t return by the time appointed, or break my vow, and loo&s;e the object of may wi&s;hes&mdash;Unle&s;s &s;ome future event takes place, my plans are fru&s;trated, as the bu&s;ine&s;s I am in at pre&s;ent will not add much to my fortune.</P>
<P>Next morning he aro&s;e and went about his bu&s;ine&s;s with great compo&s;ure of mind. In the cour&s;e of the day the Nobleman di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his body &s;ervant, for &s;ome mi&s;demeanor, and Mr. Beaumont arrived to his &s;tation which increa&s;|ed his &s;alary to one hundred &s;terling per an|num.</P>
<P>His bu&s;ine&s;s was now to wait on the Noble|man when he rode out, and in&s;pect the tables, and &s;ee that every thing was in order; and likewi&s;e to ride on errands for the Nobleman's daughter (a little Mi&s;s, aged thirteen years) who was then under the care of a writing ma&s;|ter, who attended upon her twice a day, to teach her the definitive part of writing.</P>
<P>One morning his bu&s;ine&s;s led him into her room, and &s;eeing her copy book lying on the table, he took up the pen and carele&s;sly wrote a line under the copy.</P>
<P>Shortly after, the writing ma&s;ter came in,
<PB N="17" REF="036045_0017_10080BB26BBA1780">
ca&s;t his eye on the paper, and &s;ays to the lady, did you write that line? No Sir, replied lit|tle Mi&s;s. Who did write it? I do not know, Sir, unle&s;s it was Mr. Beaumont, (the &s;ervant) and I'm &s;ure it could not be him.</P>
<P>Call him in, &s;aid the teacher. He came forth. Did you write that line, Samuel?</P>
<P>I did, Sir, but I am very &s;orry. I came in and catched hold of the pen, and wrote it care|le&s;sly, without a thought of injuring the feel|ings of any. Pardon me, Sir, for my in&s;olence.</P>
<P>You are quite excu&s;able, replied the teach|er, for it far exceeds the copy.</P>
<P>The little Mi&s;s informed her father of what had taken place. Mr. Beaumont was immedi|ately brought before the Nobleman, who ex|amined him in the languages and all other in|tricate branches of learning, and found him much preferable to him&s;elf; then turns to Mr. Beaumont, &s;aying: You &s;hall no longer be my &s;ervant. It was never prede&s;tinated by Deity that a man of your abilities &s;hould be a &s;ervant to any man of any rank or &s;tation whatever.</P>
<P>Mr. Beaumont remained &s;peechle&s;s &s;ome time&mdash;at length replies: I am contented with my &s;ituation, and am willing to &s;erve you until better bu&s;ine&s;s offers.</P>
<P>The Nobleman an&s;wers: I have an old gen|theman with me who &s;erves in the capacity of a clerk, and has been in that employment for many years pa&s;t, but has &s;olicited me &s;trongly to relea&s;e him, as he has accumulated property enough, and wi&s;hes to live a retired life. If you plea&s;e, you may have his birth, which will bring you in two hundred &s;terling per annum.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="036045_0018_10080B9B2C752250">
Mr. Beaumont thanked him kindly, and ac|cepted his offer.</P>
<P>He remained in that &s;ituation for &s;everal years, and gave perfect &s;atisfaction. But the change of his condition added great lu&s;tre to his beauty, and being a per&s;on of hand&s;ome addre&s;s and graceful conver&s;ation, united with a mo&s;t agreeable di&s;po&s;ition, &s;oon drew the at|tention of the Nobleman's daughter.</P>
<P>As the increa&s;ed in years, her pa&s;&s;ions be|came more &s;trong; but &s;he never made it known, le&s;t it &s;hould prove di&s;agreeable to her father.</P>
<P>The young lady was an only daughter, and her mother had been deed a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>Her affection was not wholly unnoticed by Mr. Beaumont, who could plainly di&s;cover that &s;he embraced every opportunity to be in his company; but more particularly when her father was ab&s;ent. Her pa&s;&s;ion at length be|came &s;o &s;trong that &s;he could no longer conceal it. Taking an opportunity when her father was ab&s;ent, &s;he very deliberately divulged her mind to Mr. Beaumont, in full; telling him that &s;he had harbored a fondne&s;s for him in her brea&s;t, which &s;he could no longer conceal.</P>
<P>If you are endowed (&s;aid &s;he) with unanim|ity &s;ufficient to ea&s;e my troubled mind, an&s;wer me frankly.</P>
<P>Mr. Beaumont &s;tood amazed for &s;ome time, but recovering, an&s;wers her in the following manner:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, to think that a per&s;on of your birth and breeding &s;hould &s;et 
<PB N="19" REF="036045_0019_10080BB41642CE88">
their affections &s;o low. My fortune is by no means adequate to your's; neither is my &s;ta|tion in life &s;o honourable as many of your &s;uit|ors, which you have denied the privilege of a &s;econd interview. As to my birth and breed|ing I leave you to judge.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The young lady makes this brief reply:</P>
<P>Sir, as to your birth and breeding, your conduct proves that to be good; and I find by experience, that money never purcha&s;ed love.</P>
<P>The Nobleman appears, and breaks up the &s;cene&mdash;She retires to her own apartment.</P>
<P>They conver&s;ed together every opportunity, until the end of the year, which was the &s;ixth year of his ab&s;ence from home.</P>
<P>The Nobleman then &s;olicited him &s;trongly to continue with him another year; but he re|fu&s;ed, knowing that the time of fulfilling his former promi&s;e was near at hand.</P>
<P>In the time he was preparing to return, the Nobleman was taken &s;ick, and died; but be|fore him death he appointed Mr. Beaumont to &s;ettle his e&s;tate, and for the love and good will he owed him, made him a pre&s;ent of five thou&s;|and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>During the time he was &s;ettling this Noble|man's e&s;tate, the young woman, recovering the troubles, in &s;ome mea&s;ure which were cau&s;ed by the death of her father, acco&s;ts Mr. Beau|mont in the following manner:</P>
<P>I have made you an offer of my heart and hand, but you never have given me an an&s;wer. Now I &s;ee nothing to hinder our being joined in the bands of wedlock. My fortune is all at your command. If you mu&s;t return to your
<PB N="20" REF="036045_0020_10080B9D761A99E8">
place of nativity I am willing to bear you com|pany, as I cannot live out of your &s;ight. She could not utter more for the rapidity of tears which flowed from her eyes, and run gently down her ro&s;y cheeks.</P>
<P>Mr. Beaumont for &s;ome time &s;tood motion|le&s;s&mdash;then bur&s;t forth in tears and &s;aid, Good Heavens! What &s;hall I do? Shall I break my former promi&s;es? Can I be &s;o cruel?</P>
<P>On hearing of this, Mi&s;s Bet&s;y &s;tarts up with an air of wildne&s;s&mdash;What promi&s;es?</P>
<P>Mr. Beaumont now gives her a narrative of all the tran&s;actions at home&mdash;with an account of the treatment he received from Mr. Gauze&mdash;how Mi&s;s Nancy was confined&mdash;and his pro|mi&s;e of returning at the clo&s;e of that year.</P>
<P>On hearing of this, &s;he flew to his arms and embraced him, when they both wept bitterly.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Nancy now cries out in the following manner: True genuine love never was pur|cha&s;ed by riches; but may heaven reward you for your con&s;tancy. I have nothing to lay to your charge. You have ever treated me with re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s.&mdash;As my days here be|low are of &s;hort duration, and the trea&s;ures of this world are as filthy rags, I impart my portion to you, hoping it may in &s;ome mea&s;|ure con&s;titute your happine&s;s in this world of trouble and &s;orrow, which I hope to leave &s;hortly.</P>
<P>A heart of adamant would have melted to have &s;een the&s;e unfortunate lovers in &s;o melan|choly a &s;ituation. But they did not remain &s;o long: For in the cour&s;e of three days, Mi&s;s Bet&s;y langui&s;hed and died. She willed to Mr.

Beaumont, ju&s;t before her death, thirty thou&s;|and pounds &s;terling, and made him executor of her e&s;tate, which brought him a hand&s;ome &s;um; be&s;ide, now finding him&s;elf clear of a &s;cene of trouble and difficulty which he was deeply engaged in for upwards of &s;ix long years.</P>
<P>He now &s;ets out to obtain the object of his wi&s;hes, by returning to his native country&mdash;After furni&s;hing him&s;elf and his intended &s;pou&s;e with two &s;uits of the be&s;t clothes France could afford, he takes leave of his beloved ac|quaintaince, and &s;ets out of his pa&s;&s;age home.</P>
<P>When he arrived at port, he found a ve&s;&s;el bound for Bo&s;ton, and ready to &s;ail in a few days. After &s;trict examination, he found the ve&s;&s;el belonged to Mr. Gauze, his intended fa|ther in law. On his pa&s;&s;age, he became ac|quainted with the captain, who gave a narra|tive of the tran&s;actions at home in the time of his ab&s;ence. He al&s;o informed him that Mi&s;s Nancy was courted by captain Sheldrick, who belonged to the Ea&s;t India company.</P>
<P>On his arrival he found it to be in fact the ca&s;e; and that the intended marriage was to be celebrated the next day.</P>
<P>After &s;ome refre&s;hment on board, Mr. Beau|mont divulges the whole matter to the crew, begging their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;aying, I will dre&s;s my&s;elf in &s;ailors' habit, and go with the hands, and inform Mr. Gauze of the ve&s;&s;el's arrival. After writing a letter, they proceeded and en|tered the hou&s;e &s;ailor like, and informed Mr. Gauze of the arrival of the ve&s;&s;el and the good voyage &s;he had made. He, being overjoyed,
<PB N="22" REF="036045_0022_10080B9FB121CDF8">
ran for a bottle to treat them. In his ab|&s;ence, Mi&s;s Nancy came into the room. Mr. Beaumont fixed his eyes upon her, though at fir&s;t &s;ight he did not know her. He was how|ever, quickly convinced; and hands her the letter. She &s;ecretly returns to her chamber, and immediately writes an answer.</P>
<P>Mr. Beaumont and the company continued in the hou&s;e, making merry with Mr. Gauze. At length he retires, charging them to send the captain up immediately. Yes, Sir, repli|ed Mr. Beaumont. Mi&s;s Nancy hands him the letter, and ca&s;ts a wi&s;hful look, though he was in a &s;ailor's apparel.</P>
<P>Mr. Beaumont informed her in his letter, that he meant to take her by force, and bring a&s;&s;i&s;tance enough to fight their way through, if he &s;hould be mole&s;ted.</P>
<P>She an&s;wers him: I have received your let|ter from your own hand, and ob&s;erve the con|tents: and mo&s;t cordially acquie&s;e in all your propo&s;als.</P>
<P>Accordingly he came and found her by the kitchen door, ready to receive him with open arms. He conveyed her to a Coffee-Hou&s;e, &s;ent for a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and were joined in the bands of wedlock, it being on Saturday evening.</P>
<P>The next morning they dre&s;&s;ed and walked out: and tow &s;uch &s;uits of clothes were never before &s;een in the town of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>On Monday the wedding was attended by the parents and relations of both parties; and all tho&s;e was would wish to partake, were made welcome.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="036045_0023_10080BB988A58428">
Mr. Beaumont di&s;tributed his property, in part to his parents, &s;o as to make them com|fortable through life; and was left then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more property than Mr. Gauze.</P>
<P>They crowned the remainder of their days in love and unity; and thus enjoyed all the plea&s;ures which can contribute to the happine&s;s of a rural life.</P>
