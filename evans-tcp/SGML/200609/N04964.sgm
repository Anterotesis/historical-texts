<P>One Ship of 84 Guns, and another of 74, put back to <HI>France</HI> in a &s;hatter'd Condition.
And,</P>
<P>One 64 Gun Ship and a Frigate, proceeded with 260 Sail of Merchantmen for the We&s;t-Indies.</P></Q>

<P>By a Letter from Capt. <HI>Bowne,</HI> of the Privateer Brigt. <HI>Trembleur,</HI> of this Port, we learn, That on the 1&s;t of <HI>Nov.</HI> la&s;t, he fell in with and took a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Privateer Sloop, of 6 Carriage Guns, 6 Pounders, 12 Swivels, Blunderbu&s;&s;es, Lances, with other Small-Arms, and 140 Men, after a very ob&s;tinate Engagement; the Enemy, when they &s;truck, not having one Sail nor Rope left whole, and their Boom and Bow-&s;prit &s;hot to Pieces; Capt. Bowne (who had one Man killed in the Engagement, and his Sails and Rigging much damaged) took her in Tow, and carried her into <HI>St. Thomas</HI>; and was, on the Date of his Letter, going in Company with the <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> Privateer of <HI>New-York,</HI> off <HI>Martineco,</HI> to wait for a <HI>French</HI> Fleet daily expected there, very probably that mention'd above.
