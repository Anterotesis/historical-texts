<HEAD>THE NEWS-CARRIER's ADDRESS TO HIS CUSTOMERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Hartford,</HI>

<L>IN England, where the poets &s;cribble,</L>
<L>And thrive on flattery and libel,</L>
<L>A chatt'ring, poor, poetic parrot,</L>
<L>Deck'd with the lofty name of Laureat,</L>
<L>Is cull'd, and hired with &s;al'ry clear</L>
<L>Of one good hundred pounds a year,</L>
<L>On ev'ry New-Year's day to &s;ing</L>
<L>So bright a Queen, &s;o good a King;</L>
<L>To hail their George in birthday lays,</L>
<L>And &s;tuff his happy ears with prai&s;e:</L>
<L>Till puft'd aloft in Laureat ode,</L>
<L>The oaf believes him&s;elf a god,</L>
<L>Dreams all his foes before him quaking,</L>
<L>And &s;carce believes Cornwallis taken.</L>
<L>But in this land, as fates befall,</L>
<L>Where ver&s;e comes &s;low, and pay is &s;mall,</L>
<L>Where folks have other rules to chu&s;e by,</L>
<L>Your only Laureat is the News-Boy;</L>
<L>Who ev'ry New-Year's morn, in time</L>
<L>Hands round his little page of rhyme,</L>
<L>Collects his pence from hands propitious,</L>
<L>And pays the ballance in good wi&s;hes.</L>
<L>Yet he, tho' young in years and name,</L>
<L>With plea&s;ure views his Country's fame;</L>
<L>Beholds the happy land &s;ecure</L>
<L>In freedom and imperial power,</L>
<L>That freedom earn'd by foes repell'd,</L>
<L>In many a bright, but dreadful field,</L>
<L>Where Briti&s;h pride avail'd no more,</L>
<L>But fled from troops it &s;corn'd before;</L>
<L>Beholds our Chief's and State&s;men's name</L>
<L>Above all Greek and Roman fame;</L>
<L>Sees foreign realms afford us aid,</L>
<L>And credit ri&s;e from taxes paid;</L>
<L>Sees Science tune th'immortal lays,</L>
<L>And Genius rip'ning into prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Beholds the foe our deeds revere,</L>
<L>And learn humanity by fear:</L>
<L>While now no fires of battle ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Nor de&s;olation &s;preads the &s;kies;</L>
<L>Their weaken'd troops from arms retreat,</L>
<L>To guard their fortre&s;&s;es and fleet,</L>
<L>Their brea&s;ts di&s;turb'd with anxious fears,</L>
<L>And all th' alarms of war are theirs.</L>
<L>And oh, to give the&s;e troubles end,</L>
<L>May white-rob'd Peace from heav'n de&s;cend!</L>
<L>Before her War's grim horrors yield,</L>
<L>And Carnage quit the &s;anguine field;</L>
<L>No terrors call with dire alarms</L>
<L>The peaceful lab'rer forth to arms,</L>
<L>But &s;afe beneath au&s;picious &s;kies,</L>
<L>The unmole&s;ted harve&s;t ri&s;e.</L>
<L>Then Trade &s;hall catch the fav'ring gale,</L>
<L>O'er ev'ry ocean pour the &s;ail,</L>
<L>And plenteous load our freighted &s;trands,</L>
<L>With fruitful &s;tores of foreign lands:</L>
<L>While unborn ages joyful &s;ee,</L>
<L>The Empire great, and ble&s;t, and free.</L>
<L>So &s;ings your bard and &s;ings delighted,</L>
<L>In lofty &s;train, like Laureat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Poet Laureat of Great-Britain, who is probably at this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;uch a &s;et of new-year's ver&s;es, as this is.</HI></NOTE> Whitehead;</L>
<L>Attempts to tune the various lay,</L>
<L>Fond of his country's prai&s;e&mdash;and pay;</L>
<L>Hopes for your &s;miles, and bowing down t' ye,</L>
<L>Tru&s;ts his kind Cu&s;tomers and their bounty.</L>
