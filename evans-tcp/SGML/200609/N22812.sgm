<HEAD>A JOURNAL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MY honored father lived in Brookfield, in Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, and engaged in the American army in the fir&s;t year of the late war, at Roxbury, and died the &s;ame year, 1775.</P>
<P>Being about the age of nineteen years, I enli&s;ted un|der En&s;ign JOHN TILLINGHAST, of Providence, &s;o an expedition again&s;t the Indians in the year 1791. When the period arrived when I mu&s;t quit my home, orders were received for a part of the &s;oldiers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> twenty-eight in all, to embark on board a ve&s;&s;el de&s;|tined to convey us towards the We&s;tern country, in which we went as far as New Brun&s;wick, under the command of Lieut. SHEARMAN. On our pa&s;&s;age to New-Brun&s;wick we had bad weather, though we arrived there in ten days; we remained there about five days, and then being equiped with our guns and accoutre|ments, we marched towards Pitt&s;burgh. The weather was exceeding hot, which made our journey very te|dious. We arrived at Pitt&s;burgh &s;ometime in August; where Lieut. SHEARMAN religned and went home; and En&s;ign BALCH, of Bo&s;ton, took the command of the detachment, to Head-Quarters. We remained there about three weeks, and then we received orders to go down the Ohio River. The boats we went down in were of two inch plank of white oak; the length of them was about forty feet, and about &s;ixteen feet wide, and they rowed with four oars, and three men at each oar, and over the top of the boats there was a roof like the roof of a building, for a defence again&s;t the Indians firing from the &s;hore; though one night we received &s;everal &s;hot from them, but there was no man hurt; and &s;o we continued our route night and day, until we arrived at FORT WASHINGTON, where we joined the main army. which con&s;i&s;ted of about two thou&s;and men; and we remained there about two weeks. Then we received orders to match for the Miamis,
<PB N="4" REF="030135_0004_0FE49F08420E3308">
about twenty-five miles, and there make another halt, and build a fort, which is called Fort Hamilton, and the main army repaired to &s;aid fort; but I was ordered another way, on command; fir&s;t going twenty miles down the Ohio River, and then entered into another &s;mall river called Big Miamis, that leads to Fort Ha|milton. From thence we advanced about forty miles further; this command was under En&s;ign COBB, of Taunton, and Serjeant HOLLY, of Rhode-I&s;land, and con&s;i&s;ted of a corporal and twenty-four privates, which went to guard a boat load of provi&s;ions round by wa|ter. This boat drew about eighteen inches of water, but the river being lower than we were aware of, we were obliged to draw the boat by main &s;trength in pla|ces of fifty and an hundred yards at a time, in eight or ten inches of water, which cau&s;ed us to be eight days on that pa&s;&s;age. On the fifth day at night, we en|camped on the banks of the river, all except the boat&s;|men, who &s;aid they would &s;leep under the banks of the river by the boat, which they did. We kept the guard on the bank of &s;aid river for fear of the Indians; and ju&s;t at day light one of the guard looked down the banks and cried out, there are Indians! he had no &s;oonet &s;poke than the Indians fired at the boatmen under the bank of the river; and as the men ro&s;e up, there was a ball &s;truck the bu&s;hes about &s;ix inches off, above <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> heads; but as it happened there was no man hurt. We were all immediately alarmed. A &s;mall party went in pur&s;uit of them, and got &s;ight of the Indians, who were on hor&s;es, and fired at them: on our firing at them they dropped their packs, and &s;ome &s;kins, and &s;everal trifling things, which they had &s;tole from the inhabitants the night before, which we got; one of the balls &s;truck an Indian on his rump, but his &s;tooping forward on his hor&s;e prevented his being much hurt, but cut his blanket from his rump to his &s;houlders; for after I was taken by the Indians, I &s;ound out that my ma&s;ter was there at that time, though I never dare let him know that I was in that party, but he often told me how nigh one of the Indians came being &s;hot. The hor&s;es they had &s;tolen out of Judge Simmons's &s;table, about twelve miles below Fort Wa&s;hington, and they were pur&s;ued &s;o clo&s;e, and our firing open them gave them a fright, and they went &s;everal miles back on the
<PB N="5" REF="030135_0005_0FE49F0AD7148DD8">
&s;ame way they came, which gave the party a chance to come up with them, which they did, and pur&s;ued them &s;o clo&s;e through the &s;wamp that the inhabitants got their hor&s;es again; but the Indians made their e&s;|cape, and got off.</P>
<P>We moved on our way with our boats, but the water being &s;o low we made a very poor hand of getting along with it, though we went about nine miles that day; and at night we encamped upon as clear a place as we could find, for fear of the Indians coming upon us: and there was a guard of a &s;erjeant and a corporal, and nine privates, and two &s;entinels &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance from the camp, to keep watch that no Indians came upon us unknown. But about ten o'clock in the evening, &s;ome Indians came creeping up to the fire, but the &s;entinels fired upon them, which alarmed the whole party; we immediately brought water from the river and put out the fire, and every man took to a tree, and &s;tood in that &s;ituation until morning. The Indians kept creeping round, and we exchanged &s;everal &s;hot with them that night; but it being very dark there was no man hurt; and when it was day-light we went into our boat, and moved on our way, but we had not gone more than half a mile, when looking back we &s;aw three Indians upon the &s;hore where we had encamped, but being very much fa|tigued, we kept on our way and took no notice of them; and on that day about three o'clock in the af|ternoon we arrived at a &s;mall garri&s;on called DUNLAP'S STATION, which was about &s;ixteen miles from the place of our de&s;tination, but we were obliged to leave our boat by rea&s;on of the lowne&s;s of the water.</P>
<P>We remained there about two days, then we went through the bu&s;h about ten miles, and came to the ar|my, and there we remained until FORT HAMILTON was fini&s;hed, and then we received orders to march for the Maumee towns, leaving about forty men to keep the garri&s;on. The road we went we had to cut and clear as we travelled, day by day, which made our journey very tedious, for we could go but &s;ix or &s;even miles a day. We went on our march until we had got about forty-five miles, and then we built another fort, that is called FORT JEFFERSON; and alter we had been building &s;aid fort about three days, I happened to be on the our-&s;ide
<PB N="6" REF="030135_0006_0FE49F13F16E7AE0">
picket guard at night. The next morning there were three of the guard and my&s;elf, not having any duty to do, obtained liberty of our officers to go half a mile di&s;tance a hunting, being very &s;cant of provi&s;ions; and after we had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;entinels, we parted, and agreed to take a &s;mall circle and then to meet upon a plain, and I went to the right hand, and coming round a &s;wamp in a blind foot path, a little di&s;tance from the plain, looking out for &s;ome game, not thinking of any danger, on coming into a thicket of bru&s;h, there ro&s;e up three Indians, which you may think not a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed me, I looked this way and that way for a place to run, but found it impracticable, for there were Indians on every &s;ide with their tomahawks over my head, &s;o I &s;aw that I might as well give up as to make any re&s;i&s;|tance, dropping my firelock, and putting out my hand to &s;hake with them, they &s;hook hands with me, and bid me make ha&s;te, and then they took me through a &s;wamp upon a dry ridge, and &s;at down for about an hour, and then went on again, and travelled until about twelve o'clock; then one of them gave a mo&s;t hideous halloo, which made the woods ring again, and one of the Indians told me by and by I would &s;ee plenty of Indians, and in about half an hour one of them gave another halloo, and a quarter of a mile forward it &s;eem|ed as though the woods were alive with Indians, and directly there came about twenty Indians running to meet us, &s;ome with knives and &s;ome with tomahawks, and painted &s;o they looked more like &s;o many evil &s;pirits than any thing el&s;e. I thought then my life was &s;hort, but they all came and &s;hook hands with me, ex|cept three or four of them, who looked very &s;urly at me, and two of them took hold of me and led me into a thick miry &s;wamp, and came upon a little dry nole in the middle of the &s;wamp, where they had had a fire about &s;ix days, watching the army; but no &s;ooner than I had got to the fire than one took off my hat, another my coat, and another my wai&s;tcoat, another my &s;hoes, and one &s;tript me of my &s;hirt and gave me an old one in lieu of it, which was very dirty; they then brought me an Indian who could &s;peak Engli&s;h, and began to examine me to know what condition the army was in, I told them as good a &s;tory as I could, as I &s;aw they were upon the catch, I made as few words an&s;wer as I
<PB N="7" REF="030135_0007_0FE49F158317A810">
could; and after they had examined me as much as they thought proper, one of them went and brought me &s;ome roa&s;ted veni&s;on, and a piece of bear's meat; and after I had eaten as much as I wanted, though I had not much appetite to eat, they a&s;ked me if I could run fa&s;t, I told them I could not; they then told me I mu&s;t run or die immediately. Then they packed up their things and &s;et out toward the Maumee town.</P>
<P>When they fir&s;t &s;et out from the camp they &s;pread them&s;elves every way, &s;o that no man could know which way they went, and after they had gone about one mile that way, they came together again; and after they came together again the &s;econd time, they gave me a pack of meal and &s;ome &s;kins about the weight of a bu&s;hel of corn; and then one Indian went forward, and they &s;et me next, and the re&s;t of the Indians fol|lowed after, hurrying me on, keeping me on the trot all the afternoon, until ju&s;t night, then one of them told me to run, I told him I could not run, for I was very weary; I had no &s;ooner &s;poke than one of the Indians &s;truck me on the back of the head with the breech of his gun, which knocked me down to the ground, but I &s;oon recovered and got up again, then I &s;aw that I mu&s;t run, though I was hardly able to walk, yet was obliged to run, and we went on that way until du&s;k of the evening. Then one of the Indians took me and lead me about half a mile from the path into a &s;wamp, and the re&s;t of the Indians went with him, and went to making a fire; but my ma&s;ter took me and &s;et down about two rods from the fire, and a&s;ked me how I &s;hould like to be tied, I told him I &s;hould not like to be tied at all, but he &s;aid I mu&s;t be tied or may be I &s;hould run away; then he took a parcel of cords, and tied me, he fir&s;t tied my elbows behind me, and my hands toge|ther forward, and then drew a mogga&s;in over each hand, and tied them both together down to the wai&s;tband of my breeches, and then laid me on my back, and tied a cord round my neck, and another round my legs, and tied them fa&s;t to a tree; and the Indians lay a&s;ide me acro&s;s the cords. I lay in this condition until morning, and it may well be thought that I underwent a great deal that night, for I was tied in &s;uch a manner that I could not &s;tir hand nor foot, neither had I any thing to cover me but the heavens, for they never gave me &s;o
<PB N="8" REF="030135_0008_0FE49F1711CB4C40">
much as a blanket to put over me, though it &s;nowed and rained; and in the morning when they untied me, I was &s;o &s;tiff with the cold I could not &s;tand, but I rolled over the ground and rubbed my&s;elf awhile, and &s;et by the fire, till I got &s;o that I could go; then making them&s;elves ready, moved on their way to town again. When they had travelled about three or four miles they made a halt for about half an hour, then one of the Indians came and painted me black, and painted them&s;elves black likewi&s;e; but not knowing the meaning of being painted in &s;uch a &s;ort, I thought it was done for their own diver&s;ion. But they im|mediately went on their way, until about ten o'clock in the forenoon, then making another &s;tand, which had like to have been my la&s;t, they fir&s;t &s;potted the trees around for &s;ome di&s;tance, and then made blacking of powder and marked the trees in all kinds of disfigured creatures. Then they came round and began to make a &s;peech, and the Indian that painted me, told me to get up. Now my ma&s;ter had gone in pur&s;uit of a deer, and was not with the re&s;t of the company. In the mean time, while they were cutting their capers over me, my ma&s;ter came up and looked angry at them, and in a great rage, and made a long &s;peech to them, which &s;eemed to di&s;plea&s;e many of them, but they &s;oon took up their packs and was for marching on. Now I was to have been tomahawked here, but I knew no|thing of it until after I was brought to the Maumee town; and my ma&s;ter coming up at that time, was the means of &s;aving my life. But we had not gone far from this place, when the Indian that was the means of &s;a|ving my life told me to wa&s;h off the black that was on my face, which he &s;aid was no good, which I immedi|ately did, and then he painted my face red, which was a token that I was not to die. We went on the re|mainder of the day, and at night when we encamped, they bound me as they did before, which I thought was very hard u&s;age, to travel all day, and at night be bound in &s;uch a manner. But on the third day, about four o'clock, we arrived at the Maumee town; but when we had got within about two miles of &s;aid town, the Indians made a halt, and my ma&s;ter painted my face one half red and the other part black, and then tied a
<PB N="9" REF="030135_0009_0FE49F189FC19BB0">
large rope round my neck, which hung to my wai&s;t; then he took my pack from me, and one of the Indians that could &s;peak Engli&s;h told me by and by I &s;hould come into town; and he farther &s;aid, perhaps when you get into the town, &s;ome &s;aucy boys will come out and &s;trike you, and if they do, you will &s;ee a long hou&s;e, and you mu&s;t run to that hou&s;e and &s;it down, and they will &s;trike you no more, which I found to be true: for when we had got within about half a mile of the town, one of the Indians gave a loud halloo, and it &s;eemed as though the woods were alive with Indians for a mile round; and immediately the &s;avages came running to meet us as thick as the &s;quirrels in the woods, which I thought the mo&s;t frightful &s;ight I ever beheld; but di|rectly we came into the town, and as we pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t camp there came out a young Indian warrior, and &s;truck me on the back of my neck, and I fell to the ground; and when I recovered on my knees, another gave me a kick, and kicked me on my face, and as &s;oon as I got up another Indian caught me by the hand and &s;aid run, run, you devil! and as I run he &s;truck me over the face and eyes; and when I had got within an hun|dred yards of the long hou&s;e which the Indian told me of the path on both &s;ides was paraded with Indians, as many as could &s;tand; and as I run through, every one of them gave me a blow, &s;ome with their hand and &s;ome with a club, and others a kick with the foot, but every one would have a blow at me; &s;o that when I got to the hou&s;e, my face was as bloody as though I had dipped my head in blood, be|&s;ides other brui&s;es all over my body. Ju&s;t as I got to the door, and was going in, one of the Indians hit me on the &s;ide of the head and &s;ent me pa&s;t the corner of the hou&s;e; but I &s;crambled up again and went into the hou&s;e, and as &s;oon as I entered the door I met an old grey-headed chief, and &s;hook hands with him, but I was &s;o grieved with &s;uch u&s;age, that I could not re|frain &s;hedding tears, which I think almo&s;t every one would have done, but he &s;aid you mu&s;t not cry, for if you do the Indians will kill you; but I &s;at down, and immediately they brought me a white man to examine me, which he did very clo&s;ely, concerning the army, and what &s;ituation they were in, though I made my &s;tory as &s;hort as possible. And then they took him out
<PB N="10" REF="030135_0010_0FE49F22190E1BB8">
and brought in another, to &s;ee whether I told one &s;tory or not, and after they had re-examined me as much as they plea&s;ed, they went and brought me &s;ome of their bread made of pounded corn, and &s;ome hommany; and after I had eaten, they brought to me a little pri|&s;oner boy that had been taken about two years before on the river called Monongahela, though he delighted more in the ways of the Savages than in the ways of Chri&s;tians; he u&s;ed me wor&s;e than any of the Indians, for he would tell me to do this, that and t' other, and if I did not do it, or made any re&s;i&s;tance, the Indians would threaten to kill me, and he would kick and cuff me about in &s;uch a manner that I hardly dare to &s;ay my &s;oul was my own, although I daily underwent the greate&s;t cruelty. Often times there would Indian &s;trangers come to vi&s;it their tawny brethren, and the fir&s;t &s;alute they would give generally was to knock me down, and frequently to repeat their blows; and if I made any re&s;i&s;tance, or &s;hewed re&s;entment before or after I got up, tho&s;e &s;avage-like brutes would repeat the &s;ame treatment, with terrible additions. I was forced to &s;ubmit in &s;ilence to that u&s;age for the &s;pace of a week.</P>
<P>It being then about the time the Indians were ga|thering to meet the American army for battle, there was a number of &s;trangers in the vicinity, and my mas|ter told me they would kill me, and took me from the long council-hou&s;e to his wife's camp, although &s;he was gone to the hunting ground (which di&s;tance was about fifty miles) to winter; and the &s;avages was ga|thered together in this town for a general rendezvous, and remained here in number fifteen hundred, or there|abouts, for one week, and then they all marched to meet Gen. St. Clair's army; and after tho&s;e Indians were gone, my ma&s;ter's &s;on took me to their hunting ground, where his ma&s;ter and &s;everal young Indians were, where I had more of a dog's life than that of a chri&s;tian, for they would not allow me to &s;leep in the camp with them; and if I made a hut by my&s;elf, the Indian boy would pull it away, as if it was only to wear and fatigue me, and if they thought I was offended at it, they did it with &s;eeming more plea&s;ure, and I was obliged to &s;ubmit, and thro the protection of divine providence I was enabled to &s;upport it.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030135_0011_0FE49F23A4E052A8">
In the beginning of winter tho&s;e &s;avages lived only four or five days in a place, and would move eight or ten miles further at each move, and kept in continual motion until the &s;now was &s;ome depth; and by that time they had got one hundred and fifty miles from the town; at that time I had to build huts for five fami|lies, to cut wood and carry it &s;ome di&s;tance, becau&s;e they would not burn any but dry, &amp;c. I had a very &s;hort allowance of provi&s;ions, and being almo&s;t naked for the want of clothes, let the weather be wet or dry, hot or cold, I was kept at hard work of &s;ome kind or other, &s;uch as dre&s;&s;ing Deer-&s;kins, or hunting Rac|coons; and with &s;avage &s;houts they would bid me ex|ert my&s;elf, or I &s;hould die. But the fatigues day and night was not all I &s;uffered, for the Indian boys when I was a&s;leep, u&s;ed frequently to put live coals at my feet, to divert them&s;elves in &s;eeing me &s;tart; and as I had no clothes to my&s;elf, I often lay very near the fire; one night a boy of the tawny breed drove me farther from the fire, but I told them that I would not lay back any further unle&s;s they would give me &s;ome covering, but their cruelty was further exerted in not giving me any thing to eat for two days afterwards; and &s;ome times I would get meat and lay it up in the camp, but the boys would frequently come in and give it to the dogs, on purpo&s;e to in&s;ult me and put me to trouble; and one day there came one only into the camp where I fleat, took down my meat and gave it to the dog, looked me in the face and laughed. It offended me &s;o much that I thought I might as well be tomahawk|ed as to live in torments and vexations, and immedi|ately caught up a &s;tick and &s;truck him over the head, and knocked him down, and almo&s;t &s;tunned him; I was then certain there was not any po&s;&s;ibility of &s;aving my life, for he got up very quick and went to my ma&s;ter, and told him of the affair, and it proved well for me that he made additions to the &s;tory. I went to a camp that belonged to an Indian trader, and told him what had happened, and de&s;ired him to go and plead me off from being killed: but I had hardly told my &s;tory, before I &s;aw my ma&s;ter coming with his tomahawk in his hand, and &s;eemed in a great rage, but the man went and met him, and de&s;ired him to hear the other &s;tory before he went any farther, which he

complied with, and after he had heard the truth of the whole matter, and how he was always tormenting and fatiguing me, turned back and went his way, but never &s;aid any thing of the affair to me afterwards. Soon after this affair happened, my ma&s;ter went a hunt|ing for &s;everal days, and when he came home he brought &s;everal &s;trangers with him, and they encamped but a &s;mall di&s;tance from us, and at night my ma&s;ter told me to cut &s;ome wood for them, I replied that I was very hungry, for I had eat nothing that day, and he &s;aw that I did not move &s;o quick as I ought to have done, he called his &s;on, and told him to bring his war club, at my hearing that, I caught bold of my leggings and mauca&s;ins to put them on, but he came in a very great rage and violence with a war club in his hand, and &s;truck at me with great force, and would have killed me, but as I &s;aw the blow a coming I knocked off the back part of the cabbin and e&s;caped the blow, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have had my brains &s;cattered through the camp; but I immediately got my tomahawk and went about three hundred yards from the camp, cut wood enough for them to burn that night; and having no|thing on my feet or legs, the cru&s;t of the &s;now being almo&s;t hard enough to bear me up, but breaking thro' nearly every &s;tep being knee deep. Thus when I had done that &s;mall ta&s;k (as they called it) my feet and legs looked as if they had been cut and hacked with &s;ickles and cro&s;&s;cut &s;aws, the blood pre&s;&s;ing forth from each gha&s;tly wound, from my knees to my toes; and when the &s;avage-like brutes &s;aw it, they laughed at me, and &s;aid I had got a beautiful pair of &s;triped leggings on, which would make me re&s;t well, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They u&s;ed to &s;end me a hunting often times with the Indian boys, and &s;ometimes we &s;hould be gone three or four days at a time; at night after I had made a fire for them, they would make me build another for my|&s;elf; and one time in particular, that we were our, I &s;uppo&s;ed we were within forty miles of an American fort, and in the morning I came to the fire, as they lay a&s;leep, and took their tomahawks, and almo&s;t deter|mined to kill them both, and make my e&s;cape unto the American fort; but I took the &s;econd thought that the woods were full of Indians, and if they &s;hould come acro&s;s my track, and follow me, they would have ten

chances to catch me, where I had one to get clear of them; and I thought I &s;hould have &s;ome opportunity of getting away without running &s;uch a great ri&s;k; &s;o I concluded it was be&s;t to be as patient as I could, altho' I had the tomahawk up &s;everal times to drop it into their heads; but I forebore &s;triking.</P>
<P>Not long after that, as one of the Indian boys was &s;itting one day in the camp with me alone, he on &s;ide of the fire and I on the other, and having his bow in his hand, and a handful of wooden arrows, he would &s;hoot them at me, and after many trials he &s;hot one into my wrist, which bent the point again&s;t the bone, I caught hold of a &s;tick about three inches thick and threw at him, and hit him on the &s;ide of his head, which knock|ed him almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s; but it happened to be when my ma&s;ter was gone, and he did not get home under three weeks after, and by that time it had all died away; for I never heard any thing more about it; although if my ma&s;ter had been at home I believe there would not have been any &s;uch thing as &s;aving my life; for I was for|ced to keep out of the way of the &s;quaws for two days, or they would have tomahawked me them&s;elves.</P>
<P>By this time of the year corn grew very &s;carce, and the meat was very poor, and but a little of it for my &s;hare; &s;ometimes they would kill a raccoon, and my part of it would be the head without any thing to eat with it, that was my allowance for a day, and very often for two or three days, and nothing at all but what nuts I could find in the woods, and &s;ome other trifles, and about the middle of March, as &s;ome of the Indian boys were a hunting, they found a large black &s;nake, that was drawn out of the water by a mink, and brought it to the camp, roa&s;ted it with a &s;quirrel, broke it up fine, and gave it to me to eat; but as &s;oon as I found out what it was, I hove it down by the fire &s;ide, and when my mi&s;tre&s;s perceived that, &s;he told me if I could not ear it, I &s;hould not have any thing, and they never offered me any thing more for three days; but about that time there were &s;everal Indians going upon a &s;cout towards the American frontiers, my ma&s;ter and all the Indians that belonged to our family, went with that party, and left me with my mi&s;tre&s;s; but there were &s;everal other Indian camps, and &s;ome remaining Indians in the neighbourhood, who had orders to cha&s;|tize

me if I &s;hould be &s;aucy to my mi&s;tre&s;s; and we re|mained in that place about a week, and &s;ome American Indians came within ten miles of us, and killed two or three families of the Delaware Indians, which put tho&s;e that I was with in &s;uch a fright, that they fled to their towns, which was about one hundred and fifty miles, but the way we went it was two hundred miles, to keep out of &s;ight of &s;ome enemy Indians; the way being very bad that we went, our journey la&s;ted three weeks, and all that time my mi&s;tre&s;s never gave me one &s;poon|ful of any thing to eat, only what I could get in the woods, &s;uch as ground nuts, and &s;ome other nuts, and having a pack to carry weighing &s;ixty or &s;eventy pounds (that being my daily ta&s;k) and frequently I could get no|thing to eat for two days; &s;ometimes I &s;hould get a pack of ground nuts, and my mi&s;tre&s;s would take them all from me. One day I borrowed a gun of an Indian and went a hunting, to kill &s;omething to eat, and by chance I &s;ound eight large black &s;nakes &s;unning them|&s;elves, I killed and &s;trung them upon a &s;tick, and carried them to the camp; my mi&s;tre&s;s looking out imagined I had &s;ome black &s;quirrels; I came into camp and threw down the &s;nakes at the old &s;quaws feet, which enraged her much, &s;he threw the tomahawk at me; the next thing that came to hand was a brand of fire, on which I was obliged to leave the camp, and did not come in again that day: but when the other Indians &s;aw her, that knew of her giving me a roa&s;ted &s;nake to eat &s;ome days before, it plea&s;ed them very much, becau&s;e they &s;aid I &s;erved her tit for tat, or paid the old &s;core; in the evening &s;he called me, and a&s;ked what I brought tho&s;e &s;nakes to her for, I made reply that they were to pay her for the one &s;he gave me to eat, &s;he believing that I was even with her, let it drop, and it &s;oon blew over, though I fared none wor&s;e for provi&s;ions after|wards. When we arrived at the Maumee town, I was re&s;olved to make my e&s;cape from the Indians. We arrived at the town about the middle of the afternoon; and after I had made a camp for my mi&s;tre&s;s, we not encamping on the &s;ide of the river the town was, I took a walk down the river to &s;ee if I could find a canoe to make my e&s;cape in, which I did, lying under the bank of the river, and in the evening about nine o'clock, af|ter the old &s;quaw had got a&s;leep, I got up and crept

away from the camp, and then had to go one quarter of a mile through thick bu&s;hes to the river; it was ex|ceedingly dark, and when I came there, the canoe was gone: I was obliged to make all the &s;peed I could to get back to the camp, for fear I &s;hould be mi&s;&s;ed, and I had but ju&s;t got to the fire, and laid down, before my mi&s;tre&s;s called me to make up a fire; on the next morning there came a pri&s;oner by the name of Morris Doyle, from over the river, and I went out to work and a&s;ked him if he did not mean to try to make his e&s;|cape from the Indians; he &s;aid he did not know the woods, but if he could get any one to &s;et off with him, he would go; I told him that I was re&s;olved to go that night, and he &s;aid if we could get together he would go with me, and I a&s;ked him how we &s;hould get together; he &s;aid his ma&s;ter had a very nice canoe, and oftentimes the Indians would come after they were gone to bed, to come over the river, and he had to get up and fetch them acro&s;s, and he &s;aid I mu&s;t come down when I thought the Indians were all a&s;leep and give an Indian halloo, and he would get up and come over the river with the canoe, and we would make the be&s;t of our way down the river, night and day, until we arrived at &s;ome chri&s;tian &s;ettlement; but it happened in my favour, my mi&s;tre&s;s went over the river that day to &s;ee her daugh|ter, and when &s;he came back &s;he &s;aid I mu&s;t go over the river that night and &s;tay there to clear land for corn: this plea&s;ed me very well, for I knew that I &s;hould have a much better opportunity to make my e&s;cape from them, and after I had got over the river where I was go|ing to work, I &s;taid there until about &s;un&s;et, and then I a&s;ked liberty of the Indian if I might go and &s;ee Mor|ris Doyle, I &s;aid I had not &s;een him for a great while, and he told me I might, &s;o I went to his camp, which was about a mile; when I came there he had ju&s;t got over the river from work, I told him that he might make ready for a &s;tart that night, for the &s;ooner we went the better; we could make our e&s;cape, for my ma&s;ter was gone out to war, and all the Indians that belonged to that family, and I did not think the other Indians would follow us &s;o clo&s;e as my ma&s;ter; &s;o we agreed to go that night, and as &s;oon as it was dark I went out, as though I was going home, and lay in the bru&s;h, until the Indians were all a&s;leep, and then I came in very &s;till,

and awoke him, and we went down to the canoe, and when we came there we found no paddles in the canoe, and very poor poles, and the water was &s;ix and &s;even feet deep, and when we had gone down the river about half a mile, the Indian camps being very thick upon the banks of the river, they heard us going down, though it was &s;o dark they could not &s;ee us, but there came an Indian down to the bank of the river, and called out three or four times, and a&s;ked who was there; but we &s;quat down in our canoe, and let the current carry us down pa&s;t them, but we had not gone more than three miles before we were hailed again by the Indians; but we &s;et down in the canoe until we drifted pa&s;t the camp, and then we went about four miles, and there came an Indian out of his camp, and came down to the river with a brand of fire in his hand, and &s;poke in his own language, and a&s;ked who was there, but we made no an&s;wer, but went on as fa&s;t as we could; we went on for an hour and a half, and we &s;aw &s;ome per&s;on going down by the &s;ide of us with a brand of fire in his hand; I then told Doyle that it was not &s;afe for us to go any further in a canoe, for I believed that the Indian was going down to head us, &s;o we run our canoe a&s;hore, and took to the land, and I went forward expecting that he was clo&s;e behind me until I had got as much as a mile, then I made a halt, and called him, but I could heal nothing of him; I &s;aw that it would not do for me to tarry long, for I heard the Indian canoes after us; I went that night with all the &s;peed that I could make, although it was very &s;low, for it was exceeding dark, and about midnight it began to rain; &s;ome part of the way I went on the bank of the river, and the other part took to the woods, thick and thin, and went through &s;wamps and thickets, &s;ometimes I would run, and very often was brought up with my legs again&s;t an old log, which would pitch me headforemo&s;t into the bu&s;h for nearly a rod; and one time as I was a running, came to a gutter that run through from a pond, and the bank being almo&s;t &s;traight down about twelve feet deep, and it being very dark that I did not perceive it, and taking one large &s;tep from top to bottom came headfore|mo&s;t into it in about four feet of water; but not|with&s;tanding I made &s;hift to force my way through.

frighted at that mi&s;tep, but when I came to the bank on the other &s;ide, it being &s;omething &s;teep, I was very much troubled to get up, and falling back a number of times, but by good luck at la&s;t I got out; I travelled until daylight, and then went three miles back from the river into the woods, and came to a thick &s;wamp, crept into a hallow log and lay there until evening, and then &s;et out on my nocturnal rout; but faring very hard, and my being much bewildered, I did not know which way to &s;teer, but I travelled about two hours, and could not find the river, then I was certain that I had got lo&s;t; I then turned another cour&s;e, and had not gone more than a mile before I came to a foot path, and then I did not know which way to go, but I happened to take the wrong way, and had not gone far before I met an Indian in the path; but I knew if I run I &s;hould cer|tainly be taken; and I thought perhaps if I could keep by him and &s;ay nothing, I might not be mi&s;tru&s;ted; but as I came near him he a&s;ked me where I was go|ing, I told him that I was hunting after a hor&s;e, and had got lo&s;t; he a&s;ked me what my ma&s;ter's name was, I told him I did not know; but he was a Dela|ware; then he a&s;ked me if I thought I could find my camp alone; I told him that I expected that this path would lead to &s;ome camp that I knew. He &s;aid there was a camp clo&s;e by us; then I told him that I would go there with him, and perhaps I &s;hould know the way home from there; he &s;aid he was a going there, then I believed I could not e&s;cape, as I could do no le&s;s than go with him, &s;o I followed him to the camp, and when we came there, he a&s;ked me if I knew the camp, I re|plied no, I did not, but I would &s;tay there until the next morning, and then I could find the way home; all this time he did not mi&s;tru&s;t my running away from the In|dians, but when we came into the camp, he told them that I was lo&s;t and wanted to &s;leep there that night, &s;o that I might find the way home in the morning; but in the mean time in came the infamous George Girty, the younger, and he knew me, and al&s;o that I had run away from the Indians, for they had been down to his camp that day after me; when he fir&s;t came in he look|ed at me, and &s;poke in the Indian language, and a&s;ked them how I came there, they made an&s;wer that I was lo&s;t, but Girty &s;aid that I was a liar, for he &s;aid there

were two that run away from the Indians, and I was one of them; for, he &s;aid, the Indians was after us, and had left word with him to take me up if he could find me; then Girty a&s;ked me if I did not run away from the In|dians, I told him I did not, he &s;aid he believed I told a lie; they directly began to conver&s;e together, to know what they &s;hould do with me; Girty &s;aid, that he would take me home with him, and the next day he would take me back to my ma&s;ter; all that while I &s;et very well compo&s;ed, as if I could not under&s;tand their lan|guage, although I knew if I could get over the river, I &s;hould &s;tand a very good chance to make my e&s;cape once more. The next day we &s;et off to go to his camp, which was about &s;ix miles; he took very good care that I &s;hould not go behind, for he put me forward, following on with a tomahawk in one hand, and his rifle piece in the other, and we went in that condition until we arrived at the river, and he called for a canoe, and we went acro&s;s, and &s;oon came to his camp; but when we came there, his father and James Girty his brother, knew me, and &s;everal others of the Indians, and George Girty a&s;ked me where I wi&s;hed to go; I told that I wanted to go where I could have better fare than I had among the Indians; he a&s;ked me if they did not give me enough to eat? I told him, in&s;tead of giving me enough to eat, they gave me nothing at all. He a&s;ked me if I was hungry, I told him that &s;ome victuals would be very kindly accepted, for I had not eat any thing for three weeks but what I could get in the woods; he told me if I would go and cut &s;ome wood and make a fire, I &s;hould have &s;omething to eat; it was then evening, and I cut &s;ome wood and made a fire. As I de&s;igned to make my e&s;cape the fir&s;t opportunity, I &s;at by the fire all night, and I made two or three attempts to get away, but the dogs would hear me, and make &s;uch a barking that the &s;avages would get up to &s;ee what the matter was; but early in the morning I heard them a whi&s;pering together to know what they &s;hould do with me. The old &s;quaws, and young Girty &s;aid, they would carry me back that day to my ma&s;ter again. Hearing this, and not having any chance to get away, made me feel very down-hearted; and there was one George White-Eyes that could under&s;tand Engli&s;h&mdash;perceiving that I was &s;omewhat troubled in mind,
<PB N="19" REF="030135_0019_0FE49F3F4A0B6940">
a&s;ked me what the matter was, I told him that I heard them &s;ay that they would carry them back to my ma&s;|ter; but I told him I was re&s;olved not to go alive, for I knew they would put me to the torture in a mo&s;t barbarous manner; and when he told them what I &s;aid, they concluded to &s;end word to the Indians that I was there, which they did, by &s;ending young Girty un|known to me. When he had been gone about half an hour, a little negro boy that belonged to James Girty, a&s;ked me if I knew where young Girty was gone, I told him I did not, he &s;aid that he heard them agree for me to be kept there all day, while they could give word to the Indians. When I heard this, I went to old George Girty, and a&s;ked him where young Girty was gone, he &s;aid he was gone after an hor&s;e which was lo&s;t. Then I was convinced there was evil determined again&s;t me. I then told him that it lay in his power to help me, and begged he would. He &s;aid he thought I had better be contented to go back, for he did not think the Indians would hurt me. I told him he could not &s;atisfy me with &s;uch &s;tories as that, for he knew better. He &s;aid he could not a&s;&s;i&s;t me for fear of the Indians, for if they knew that he helped me, they would fall aboard of him; but he &s;aid that I might go to James Girty, his brother, and perhaps he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me, which I did; and when I came to him he al&s;o told me he could not do any thing for me for fear the Indians would find it out and blame him. Then I a&s;sked him if I might not go over the river to one McDaniel's, that kept a &s;tore on the other &s;ide, he &s;aid I might go &s;ee him if I would come back again; I told him if he was afraid of my running away, he might &s;end his ne|gro boy with me, accordingly he did; but as &s;oon as I got over the river, I told the boy to &s;tand by the canoe 'till I run up to the hou&s;e, and then I would come back again; but in&s;tead of going to the hou&s;e I went into the woods about a mile, and crept under an old log, and lay there from &s;unri&s;e until dark; then went to Mr. McDanie's and told him my condition, and beg|ged his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but he &s;aid it was not in his power to help me; but if I had been there about two hours &s;ooner I might have had my pa&s;&s;age into Detroit, for he had &s;ent two pettiaugers of packs to Detroit; but he could not a&s;&s;i&s;t me for fear of the Indians. I a&s;ked

him if he could not help me to &s;ome provi&s;ions, he &s;aid he had none but what he bought of the Indians, and had not any on hand. Then I began to be almo&s;t di&s;|couraged for fear of being taken; but by chance there was a pri&s;oner who lived near by, who a&s;ked me if I had not made my e&s;cape from the Indians, I told him that I had; he told me it was not &s;afe for me to be there, for the Indians were hunting after me but a little while be|fore; he advi&s;ed me to go down the river that night; he gave me a paddle and &s;hewed me a large pettiauger that I could go acro&s;s the river in to the &s;ide that the vil|lage was, and there I would find a &s;mall canoe, and to make the be&s;t of my way down the river; but when I got acro&s;s the river, and went pa&s;t the town, I could find no canoe, except a birch canoe, and not being ac|quainted with them, I made out but poorly, and the wind blew very fre&s;h up the river, &s;o that it took me quite on the other &s;ide, hard by an Indian camp on the top of the bank, and the dogs made &s;uch a barking that the Indians came out, but it was &s;o dark they could not di&s;cover me, and as &s;oon as they were &s;till I pu&s;hed over to the other &s;ide of the river, and let my canoe drive, and made the be&s;t of my way by land; then I had about two miles to get pa&s;t the Indians, and to add to my &s;orrow, through thickets and over hedge fences, 'till I was almo&s;t torn to pieces; but after I had got about three or four miles pa&s;t the Indian town, I heard two hor&s;e bells at a little di&s;tance from the river, and went to them, and caught one, and took off the cords that his legs was tied together with, and made a halter of them, and put it on, and was ju&s;t ready to mount when I heard the Indians a little di&s;tance forward, which obliged me to leave the hor&s;e &s;tanding, and make the be&s;t of my way on foot through &s;wamps and pond|holes. About twelve o'clock that night I came into a &s;mall foot path, and I &s;aw an Indian lay a&s;leep by the &s;ide of the road: previous to his laying down he had made him a fire, but it was almo&s;t out, except a &s;mall coal which I happened to &s;ee, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have &s;teped upon the Indian which when I &s;aw gave me a &s;tart: but I &s;teping back &s;oftly, and creeping by him, the Indian did not awake. So I went forward that night, until break of day. Then I went back into the woods about half a mile, and lay down and went to

&s;leep 'till about ten o'clock in the morning, then I thought I would travel a little by day-light, and I went upon the &s;hore, for the Indians were frequently pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing in the road I went in. But after I had travelled about three miles on the &s;hore, I &s;aw an In|dian camp over the river, and they di&s;covered me, and gave an Indian halloo, and I gave them another, and they hallood the &s;econd time, and I again repeated the &s;ame, which made them mi&s;tru&s;t I was not an In|dian, they likewi&s;e came down the river and got into their canoe and came after me; but the river being very wide, and the wind blew exceeding hard up the river, &s;o that it drove them up &s;tream &s;ome ways from me; for there was a long point made out into the river betwixt me, and where they had to go on &s;hore, and as &s;oon as they were pa&s;t the point, I left the river and went into the woods about forty rods from the river's bank, and crept into a thick tree top that was laying down, where I hid my|&s;elf; though I had not been there but a few minutes before the Indians came by looking after me, 'till to|wards evening, and then not finding me they returned back again; but I remained in this place until &s;un&s;et. I &s;uppo&s;ed the Indians were all encampt for that day, &s;o that there was no danger. I went on my way again. I had not gone but a few rods before I met three &s;quaws, which gave me a &s;tart, &s;uppo&s;ing there were Indians clo&s;e by, but as it happened, there was none to be &s;een. I travelled that night &s;ometimes on the run and then on the walk, &s;ometimes upon the &s;an|dy &s;hore and then up in the bu&s;h. My mogga&s;ins were &s;o worn out that my feet bled, but I made the be&s;t of my way 'till about the middle of the night, then I came where there was two large canoes loaded with &s;kins, which belonged to the Indians that were encampt a &s;mall di&s;tance from the river, and I went to the canoe to &s;ee if I could find any thing to eat, and found a bag full of Deers and Raccoons &s;kull bones, for dre&s;&s;|ing of &s;kins; it being very dark, I took to be &s;ome bread, and when I had got my hands full, not trying to eat any 'till I had got &s;ome di&s;tance from them, and when I attempted to eat I found I was deceived, which vexed me very much, after I had taken &s;o much pains to &s;teal for my life a parcel of bones. But I made all

the &s;peed I could to get away for fear of the Indians, and travelled 'till about an hour before day-light, and then I heard an Indian drum at a great di&s;tance off; then I began to be encouraged, for I &s;uppo&s;ed by the intelligence I had received, that I was not far from &s;ome chri&s;tian people. But when I had got down, the In|dian town was upon the other &s;ide of the river, all ex|cept two or three camps, which were covered with flags, and &s;tood on that &s;ide of the river, and I went to one of them and &s;aw nobody except an old &s;quaw and two &s;mall children, &s;o I made bold to go in and warm my|&s;elf by the fire, for I was very much fatigued and worn out, and chilled through with the cold, for it had hailed and rained all night, which made me very uncomfort|able, being out in the &s;torm; and when I had &s;et down by the fire about half an hour, the old &s;quaw awoke, and made &s;ome movement, &s;o I made the be&s;t of my way out of the camp, without being di&s;covered. In the mean time it had got to be day light. Then I re|paired to the river &s;ide. My moga&s;ins being quite worn out, and my feet &s;o &s;ore and bloody, and body might ea&s;ily tracked me on the ground; and when I had got down the river, about one mile, I came to a &s;mall village of Indians, where there was a &s;tore kept by a Frenchman, and as I pa&s;&s;ed by I &s;aw the door partly open, and turning to go in, I &s;aw the floor co|vered with drunken Indians, and hearing one of them &s;ay in their language there is a white man; I turned and went round the hou&s;e, and there I found a hog's-pen where the hogs had ju&s;t crept out, and I crept into their place; but I had not been there long before the Indians came round the hou&s;e, looking after me, but not finding me, they went in again; and directly a Frenchman came out of the hou&s;e, and as &s;oon as I &s;aw him I pre&s;ented my&s;elf to him, and a&s;ked him if he could not a&s;&s;i&s;t me, he &s;aid he could not, for fear the Indians would find it out and kill him. Fur|thermore, he &s;aid it was not &s;afe for me to be there; for the Indians would &s;oon be up an I likely to &s;ee me, and then it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to get clear; but he &s;aid I mu&s;t go ten miles further, and I &s;hould come to an Engli&s;hman's hou&s;e, where I &s;hould be much &s;a|fer than I was there; moreover, he &s;aid I mu&s;t be very quick in going, for the Indians would be up and

after me, and it would not be po&s;&s;ible for me to get away from them. I immediately went on ten miles, which I was about two hours in going, being very faint and tired, and my feet run with blood; and the fir&s;t hou&s;e I came to was a Mr. McCormic. My appear|ance at this time, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;mal&mdash;with|out cloathing, almo&s;t &s;tarved&mdash;and my beard and hair grown long and frightful.&mdash;When I came to the door and knocked, he bid me come in, and when he &s;aw me in that frightful &s;ituation he was almo&s;t at his wits end, and cried out where the devil did you come from? I told him that I came out of the Indian country; he an&s;wered, what the devil brought you there; I &s;aid it was my misfortune to get among them; he replied that there were a great many ra&s;cals which he would be glad to have &s;laves to the Indians all their days. I thought then I might as well remained among the In|dians, as to have ri&s;ked my life thus far, and be &s;o treated. I then a&s;ked him if he knew any white peo|ple that lived near, he &s;aid I would find them down the river. Then I bid him farewell, and went on my way down the river. I thought to my&s;elf it would be &s;afe for me to keep round by the lake to Detroit, and not be &s;een any more as I could not tell a friend from a foe. And when I had gone on about half a mile down the river, walking along very &s;lowly, and thinking to my&s;elf how I &s;hould get by &s;ome Indian towns undi&s;|covered, that was on my way, I met a man by the name of Thomas Smith, an Indian &s;tore-keeper; and as &s;oon as he &s;aw me he a&s;ked me which way I was traveling, I made an&s;wer, where I could get quarters, though he knew by my appearance that I had made my e&s;cape from the Indians; he further enquired how far I had come, I told him from the Maumee town, which was an hundred and thirty-five miles from the camp: He then a&s;ked me if I had any provi&s;ions, I told him it was the fifth day &s;ince I had eat any thing but nuts; he invited me into his hou&s;e, and &s;aid he would help me to &s;ome, which I received very kindly; for truly he was the fir&s;t friend I had found on my way. And when I had come in he gave me &s;ome victuals to eat, but I was &s;o faint that a very little &s;erved me. I had not been there more than an hour before the Indians came, is pur&s;uit of me, and began to enquire after me; but

Mr. Smith put me up in his chamber, and kept me hid there until his boat came from Detroit, then he put me on board and &s;ent me on my way thither. But on my way to &s;aid Detroit, we had two or three Indian towns to pa&s;s by, and the &s;avages were appri&s;ed of my running away, for they had the di&s;cription of me by the dre&s;s I had on when I came from them; but the boatmen gave me other clothes to put on, &s;o that my garb appeared like that of a Frenchman; &s;o I pa&s;&s;ed by undi&s;covered, although we lay wind bound in an Indian town for &s;ome days.</P>
<P>And &s;o we arrived at Detroit, April 30, 1792.</P>
