<P>IT is both certain and evident to all men, that the Publick Peace &amp; Happine&s;s of any State or Kingdom cannot be pre&s;erved, where the Laws, Liberties, &amp; Cu&s;toms e&s;tabli&s;hed by the lawful Authority in it, are o|penly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed &amp; annulled: More e&s;pecially where the Alteration of <HI>RELIGION</HI> is endeavoured, and that a Religion which is contrary to <HI>Law</HI> is endeavour'd to be introduced: Upon which tho&s;e who are mo&s;t imme|diately concerned in it, are indi&s;pen&s;ably bound to en|deavour to pre&s;erve and maintain the e&s;tabli&s;h't Laws, Liberties and Cu&s;tomes: and above all, the <HI>Religion</HI> &amp; <HI>Wor&s;hip of God</HI> that is e&s;tabli&s;hed among them: and to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> an effectual ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e that the Inhabitants of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">tate or Kingdome, may neither be deprived of their Religi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> nor of their Civil Rights.

<P>Upon the&s;e Grounds it is, that we cannot any longer forbear to Declare, that (to our great Regret) we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that tho&s;e Councellours who have now the chief Credit with the King, have overturned the <HI>Religion,</HI> Laws, and Liberties of tho&s;e Realmes: and &s;ubjected them in all things relating to their Con&s;ciences, Liberties and pro|perties, to Arbitrary Government: and that not only by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; indirect waies, but in an <HI>open</HI> &amp; <HI>undi&s;gui&s;ed manner.</HI></P>

For tho the King may pardon the Puni&s;h|ment that a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;our has incurred, and to which he is <HI>condemned,</HI> as in ca&s;es of <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> or <HI>Fellony</HI>; yet it can|not be with any colour of Rea&s;on, inferr'd from thence, that the King can entirely &s;u&s;pend the <HI>Excution</HI> of tho&s;e laws relating to <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> or <HI>Felony:</HI> unle&s;s it is pretend|ed that he is clothed with a <HI>de&s;potick</HI> or arbitrary Power, and that the lives, liberties, honours &amp; e&s;tates of his Sub|jects depend wholly on his good will &amp; plea&s;ure, and are entirely &s;ubject to him; which mu&s;t infallibly follow on the King's having power to <HI>&s;u&s;pend</HI> the <HI>Execution</HI> of the <HI>Laws,</HI> and to di&s;pence with them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e evil <HI>Coun&s;ellours,</HI> in order to the giving &s;ome Credit to this &s;trange &amp; execrable Maxime, have &s;o con|ducted the matter that they have obtain'd a Sentence from the Judges, declaring that this <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing Power,</HI> is a <HI>Right</HI> belonging to the <HI>Crown</HI>; as if it were in the power of the twelve <HI>Judges</HI> to offer up the Laws, Rights and liberties of the whole Nation to the King, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by him arbitrarily &amp; at his plea&s;ure, and expre&s;sly contrary to Laws enacted for the &s;ecurity of the &s;ubjects.

<P>It is al&s;o manife&s;t &amp; <HI>notorious,</HI> that as his Maje&s;ty was upon his coming to the Crown, received &amp; acknowledg|ed by all the Subjects of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> &amp; <HI>Ireland,</HI> as their <HI>King,</HI> without the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition, tho he made then <HI>open Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>popi&s;h Religion</HI>; &s;o he did then <HI>promi&s;e</HI> &amp; &s;olemnly <HI>&s;wear</HI> at his <HI>Coronation,</HI> that he would maintain his Subjects in the free enjoyment of their laws &amp; liberties, and in particular, that he would maintain the <HI>Church of England as it was e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law.</HI> It is like|wi&s;e certain, that there have been at diver&s;e and &s;undry times, &s;everal laws enacted for the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e Rights &amp; liberties, &amp; of the prote&s;tant Religion: and a|mong other Securities, it has been enacted, that all per|&s;ons what&s;oever, that are advanced to any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dignity, or to bear Office in either Univer&s;ity, as like|wi&s;e all other, that &s;hall be put in any Imployment, Ci|vil or Military, &s;hould declare that they were not <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> but were of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> (and <HI>that</HI> by their ta|king of the Oaths of <HI>Allegiance</HI> &amp; <HI>Supremacy</HI> and the <HI>Te&s;t</HI>) yet the&s;e evil Coun&s;ellors have in effect annulled &amp; abo|li&s;hed all tho&s;e Laws, both with relation to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Civil Employments. In order to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dig|nities and Offices, they have not only <HI>without</HI> any colour of Law, but <HI>again&s;t</HI> mo&s;t <HI>expre&s;s</HI> Laws to the contrary, &s;et up a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> of a certain number of per&s;ons, to whom they have committed the Cogni&s;ance and Direction of all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters: in the which Commi&s;&s;ion there has been &amp; &s;till <HI>is,</HI> one of his Maje&s;ties Mini&s;ters of &s;tate, who makes now publick Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Religion and who, at the time of his fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ing it, declared that <HI>for a great while before, he had believed</HI> that <HI>to be the only true Religion.</HI> By all this, the deplorable &s;tate to

which the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion</HI> is reduced, is apparent, &s;ince the Affairs of <HI>the Church of England,</HI> are now put into the hands of Per&s;ons who have accepted of a Commi&s;&s;ion that is manife&s;tly <HI>illegal,</HI> and who have executed it contrary to all Law; and that now one of their chief Members has abjured the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion</HI> and declared him&s;elf a <HI>Pa|pi&s;t,</HI> by which he is become incapable of holding an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> pub|lick Imployment. The &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners have hitherto given &s;uch proof of their Submi&s;&s;ion to the directions giv|en them, that there is no rea&s;on to doubt, but they will &s;till continue to promote all &s;uch de&s;igns as will be mo&s;t agreable to them. And tho&s;e <HI>evil Coun&s;ellors</HI> take care, to rai&s;e none to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dignities, but per&s;ons that have no Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Religion, and that now hide their Unconcernedne&s;s for it under the &s;pecious pre|tence of <HI>Moderation.</HI> The &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners have &s;u&s;|pended the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> only becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to obey an order, that was &s;ent him to &s;u&s;pend a Worthy <HI>Divine,</HI> without &s;o much as Citing him before him, to make his own Defence, or ob&s;erving the common Forms of Proce&s;s. They have turned out a Pre&s;ident, cho&s;en by the Fellows of <HI>Magdelen Colledge,</HI> and afterwards all the <HI>Fellows</HI> of that Colledge, without &s;o much as Citing them before any Court that could take legal Cogni&s;ance of that Affair, or obtaining any Sentence again&s;t them by a Com|petent Judge: and the only Rea&s;on that was given for turning them out, was their <HI>Refu&s;ing to choo&s;e for their Pre&s;ident, a per&s;on that was recommended to them by the In|&s;tigation of tho&s;e evil Councellors</HI>: tho the Right of a <HI>Free-Election</HI> belonged undoubtedly to them. But they were turned out of their <HI>Free-holds</HI> contrary to Law, and to that expre&s;s provi&s;ion in <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> that <HI>no man &s;hall lo&s;e life or goods, but by the Laws of the Land.</HI> And now the&s;e evil <HI>Coun&s;ellours</HI> have put the &s;aid College wholly in|to the hands of <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> tho as is above &s;aid, they are in|capable of all &s;uch Imployments both by the law of the Land and the Statutes of the Colledge. The&s;e Commi&s;&s;i|oners have al&s;o cited before them all the Chancellors &amp;

<HI>Arch-Deacons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> requiring them to certify to them, the names of all &s;uch Clergy men as have read the Kings <HI>Declaration</HI> for <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> and of &s;uch as have <HI>not</HI> read it: without con&s;idering that the Reading of it was not enjoined the Clergy by the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> who are their <HI>Ordinaries.</HI> The Illegality and Incompetency of the &s;aid Court of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> was &s;o <HI>notoriou&s;ly</HI> known, &amp; it did &s;o evidently appear, that it tended to the <HI>Subver&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> that the Mo&s;t Reve|rend Father in GOD, <HI>William</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Primate &amp; Metropolitan of all <HI>England,</HI> &s;eeing that it was rai&s;ed for no other End, but to Oppre&s;s &s;uch Per&s;ons as were of eminent Vertue Learning and Piety, refu&s;ed to fit or concur in it. And tho there are many expre&s;s Laws again&s;t all Churches or Chapels for the excerci&s;e of popi&s;h Religion, and al&s;o again&s;t all <HI>Mona&s;teries</HI> and <HI>Con|vents,</HI> and more particularly again&s;t the Order of the <HI>Je|&s;uits,</HI> yet tho&s;e evil Coun&s;ellors have procured Orders for the Building of &s;everal Churches and Chapel for the Ex|erci&s;e of that Religion: they have al&s;o procured diver&s;e Mona&s;teries to be erected; and in contempt of the Law, they have not only &s;et up &s;everal Colledges of <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> in diver&s;e places of the Corrupting of Youth, but have rai&s;|ed up one of the <HI>Order</HI> to be a <HI>Privy Councellor</HI> &amp; a Mini|&s;ter of State.

<P>They have al&s;o followed the &s;ame Methods with relati|on to <HI>civil</HI> Affairs: for they have procured Orders to ex|amine all <HI>Lord Lieutenants, deputy Lieutenants, Sherriffs, Ju|&s;tices of the peace,</HI> and all others that were in any publick Imployment, if they would concur with the King in the Repeal of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ts</HI> &amp; <HI>Penal Laws</HI>; and all &s;uch, who&s;e Con&s;ciences did not &s;uffer them, to comply with their de|&s;igns, were turn'd <HI>out,</HI> and <HI>others</HI> were put in their places,

And in ma|ny of the&s;e places they have put <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> Papi&s;ts, tho the Law has di&s;abled them, and warranted the Subjects not to have any regard to their Orders.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o invaded the Priviledges, and &s;ei&s;ed the <HI>Charters</HI> of mo&s;t of tho&s;e Towns that have a <HI>right</HI> to be <HI>re|pre&s;ented</HI> by their <HI>Burge&s;&s;es</HI> in Parliament; and have pro|cured <HI>Surrender</HI> to be made of them, by which the Magi&s;|trates in them have deliver'd up all their Rights and Pri|viledges to be di&s;po&s;ed of, at the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e Evil <HI>Coun&s;ellors,</HI> who have thereupon placed <HI>new</HI> Magi&s;trates in tho&s;e Towns &s;uch as <HI>they</HI> can mo&s;t entirely confide in: and in <HI>many</HI> of them they have put <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Magi&s;trates, notwith|&s;tanding the <HI>incapacities</HI> under which the <HI>law</HI> has put them.</P>
<P>And whereas no Nation what&s;oever can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the Admini&s;tration of <HI>good</HI> &amp; <HI>impartial Ju&s;tice,</HI> upon which mens <HI>Lives, liberties, honours,</HI> &amp; <HI>e&s;tates</HI> do depend; tho&s;e evil <HI>Coun&s;elors</HI> have &s;ubjected the&s;e to an <HI>arbitrary</HI> and <HI>de|&s;potick</HI> power. In the mo&s;t important affairs, they have &s;tudied to di&s;cover before hand, the <HI>Opinions</HI> of the <HI>Judges</HI>; and have turned out &s;uch, as they found would not con|form them&s;elves to their Intentions: and have put <HI>others</HI> in their places, of whom they were more a&s;&s;ured, without having any regard to their abilities. And they have not &s;tuck to rai&s;e even profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> to Courts of <HI>Judicature</HI> notwith&s;tanding their incapacity by law, and that no re|gard is due to an Sentences flowing from them. They have carried this &s;o farr, as to deprive &s;uch Judges, who in the common <HI>Admini&s;tration</HI> of Ju&s;tice, &s;hewed that they were govern'd by their <HI>con&s;ciences,</HI> and <HI>not</HI> by the <HI>directions</HI> which others gave them: by which it is apparent that they de&s;ign to render them&s;elves the ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the <HI>lives, honours</HI> &amp; <HI>e&s;tates</HI> of the <HI>&s;ubjects,</HI> of what rank or Dignity &s;oever they may be; and that without having any regard to the equity of the cau&s;e, or to the <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> of
<PB N="7" REF="039251_0007_1013F9E9D6B51470">
the <HI>Judges,</HI> whom they will have to &s;ubmit in all things to their own will and plea&s;ure: hoping by &s;uch ways to intimidate tho&s;e who are yet in imployment, as al&s;o &s;uch others, as they &s;hall think fit, to put in the rooms of tho&s;e whom they have turn'd out; and to make them &s;ee what they mu&s;t <HI>look for,</HI> if they &s;hould at any time, act in the lea&s;t contrary to their good liking: and that no failings of that kind are pardon'd in any per&s;ons what&s;oever. A great deal of <HI>blood</HI> has been &s;hed in many places of the Kingdom by Judges guided by tho&s;e evil Coun&s;ellors, a|gain&s;t all the Rules and Forms of Law, without &s;o much as &s;uffering the per&s;ons that were accu&s;ed, to plead in their own Defence. They have al&s;o, by Putting the Ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in the hands of Papi&s;ts, brought all the matters of civil Ju&s;tice into great uncertainties, with how much exactne&s;s and Ju&s;tice &s;oever that the&s;e Senten|ces may have been given. For &s;ince the Laws of the Land do not only exclude Papi&s;ts from all places of Judicature, but have put them under an incapacity, none are bound to acknowledge or to obey their Judgments, and all Sen|tences given by them, are null and void of them&s;elves: &s;o that all per&s;ons who have been ca&s;t in Trials before &s;uch popi&s;h Judges, may ju&s;tly look on their pretended Sentences as having no more force, than the Sentences of any private &amp; unauthori&s;ed per&s;on what&s;oever. So de|plorable is the ca&s;e of the &s;ubjects who are obliged to an|&s;wer to &s;uch Judges, that mu&s;t in all things &s;tick to the Rules which are &s;et them by tho&s;e evil <HI>Coun&s;ellours,</HI> who as they <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> them <HI>up</HI> to tho&s;e Imployments, &s;o can <HI>turn</HI> them <HI>out of them</HI> at plea&s;ure; and who can <HI>never</HI> be e&s;teem|ed <HI>lawful</HI> Judges; &s;o that all their Sentences are, in the Con&s;truction of the Law, of <HI>no</HI> force and efficacy. They have likewi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of all <HI>Military</HI> Imployments in the &s;ame manner: for tho the Laws have not only excluded Papi&s;ts from all &s;uch Imployments, but have in particu|lar provided that they &s;hould be di&s;armed; yet they in contempt of the&s;e Laws, have not only armed the Papi&s;ts, but have likewi&s;e rai&s;ed them up to the greate&s;t Military

Tru&s;ts both by Sea &amp; Land; and that <HI>&s;trangers</HI> as well as Natives, and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> as well as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; that &s;o by tho&s;e meanes, having rendred them&s;elves Ma&s;ters both of the affairs of the Church, of the Government of the Nation, and of the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, and &s;ubjected them all to a de&s;poick and arbitrary power, they might be in a Capaci|ty to maintain and execute their wicked De&s;igns by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Army, and thereby to en&s;lave the nation.</P>
<P>The di&s;mal effects of this Subver&s;ion of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion, laws and liberties in <HI>England</HI> appear more e|vidently to us by what we &s;ee done in <HI>Ireland</HI>; where the <HI>whole</HI> Government is put into the hands of Papi&s;ts, and where are the prote&s;tant Inhabitants are under the daily fears of what may be ju&s;tly apprehended from the arbitra|ry power which is &s;et up there, which has made great numbers of them, leave that Kingdom, and abandon their e&s;tates in it, remembring well that cruel and bloudy Ma&s;|&s;acre, which fell out in that I&s;land, in the year 1641.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e evil Coun&s;ellors have al&s;o prevailed with the King to declare in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that he is clothed with <HI>ab&s;o|lute Power,</HI> and that all the Subjects are bound <HI>to obey him without Re&s;erve</HI>: upon which he has a&s;&s;umed an arbitra|ry power both over the Religion and Laws of that King|dom, from all which, it is apparent, what is to be look't for in <HI>England,</HI> as &s;oon as matters are duly prepar'd for it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e great &amp; <HI>in&s;ufferable Oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> &amp; the open <HI>Contempt</HI> of all Law, together with the Apprehen&s;ions of the &s;ad Con&s;equences that mu&s;t certainly follow upon it, have put the Subjects under great and ju&s;t fears, and have made them look after &s;uch lawful Remedies, as are allowed of in all Nations, yet all has been without effect. And tho&s;e evil Coun&s;ellors have endeavoured to make all men apprehend, the lo&s;s of their Lives, Liberties, Honours, &amp; E&s;tates, if they &s;hould go about to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from this oppre&s;&s;ion, by <HI>Petitions, Repre&s;entations,</HI> or other means authouri&s;ed by Law. Thus did they proceed with the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> &amp; the <HI>other</HI> Bi&s;hops who hav|ing offered a mo&s;t humble Petition to the King, in terms

full of Re&s;pect, and not exceeding the number limited by Law, in which they &s;et forth in &s;hort the rea&s;ons for which they could not obey that Order, which by the In|&s;tigation of tho&s;e evil Coun&s;ellors was &s;ent them, require|ing them to appoint their Clergy to read in their Church|es, the Declaration for <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> were &s;ent to pri&s;on, and afterwards brought to a Tryal, as if they had been guilty of &s;ome enormous crime.

<P>And yet it cannot be pretended that any Kings, how great &s;oever there power has been, and how arbitrary &amp; de&s;potick &s;oever they have bin in the excerci&s;e of it, have ever reckoned it a Crime for their Subjects to come in all Submi&s;&s;ion &amp; Re&s;pect, &amp; in a due number, not exceed|ding the limits of the <HI>Law,</HI>) and repre&s;ent to them the Rea&s;ons that made it impo&s;&s;ible for them to obey their Orders. Tho&s;e evil Councellors have al&s;o treated a Peer of the Realm as a <HI>Criminal,</HI> only becau&s;e he &s;aid that the Subjects were not bound to obey the Orders of a popi&s;h Ju&s;tice of Peace: tho it is evident that (they being by law rendred incapable of all &s;uch Tru&s;ts) no regard is due to their Orders. This being the &s;ecurity which the people have by the Law, for their lives, liberties, honours, and e&s;tates, that they are not to be &s;ubjected to the arbitrary proceedings of <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> that are contrary to Law put in|to any employments Civil or Military.</P>
<P>Both We our Self, and Our deare&s;t &amp; mo&s;t entirely beloved Con&s;ort the Prince&s;s, have endeavour'd to &s;ignify in terms full of re&s;pect, to the King, the ju&s;t &amp; deep Re|gret which all the&s;e proceeding have given us; and in Compliance with his Maje&s;ty's de&s;ires &s;ignified to us, We declared both by word of mouth to His Envoy, and in writing, what Our thoughts were touching the <HI>Repealing of the Te&s;ts</HI> &amp; <HI>penal Laws,</HI> which we did in &s;uch a manner,

<P>The la&s;t and great Remedy for all tho&s;e evils, is, <HI>the Calling of</HI> a <HI>Parliament,</HI> for the &s;ecuring of the Nation, a|gain&s;t the evil practi&s;es of tho&s;e wicked Coun&s;ellors: but this could not be yet <HI>compa&s;&s;ed,</HI> nor can it be ea&s;ily brought about.

For they &s;ee well that if all prote&s;tants could enter into a mu|tual good under&s;tanding one with another, and concur to|gether in the pre&s;erving of their Religion, it would not be po&s;&s;ible for them to compa&s;s their wicked ends, They have al&s;o required all per&s;ons in the &s;everal Counties of <HI>England,</HI> that either were in any imployment, or were in any con&s;iderable E&s;teem to declare before hand, that they would concur in the Repeal of the <HI>Te&s;ts</HI> &amp; <HI>penal Laws</HI>; and that they would give their voices in the Elections to Parliament, only for &s;uch as would concur in it: Such as would not thus pre-engage them&s;elves were turned out of all Employments, and others who entred into tho&s;e en|gagements were put in their places, many of them being

<HEAD>His Highne&s;s's Additional Declaration</HEAD>
<P>AFter we had prepared &amp; Printed this our Declaration, we have under&s;tood, that the &s;ubverters of the Religion &amp; Law of tho&s;e Kingdoms, hearing of our preparations to a&s;&s;i&s;t the people again&s;t them, have begun, to retract &s;ome of the Arbitrary &amp; De&s;potick powers that they had a&s;&s;umed, and to vacate &s;ome of their Inju&s;t Judgments and Decrees. The &s;en&s;e of their Guilt, and the di&s;tru&s;t of their force, have induced them to offer to the City of <HI>London</HI> &s;ome &s;eeming relief from their Great Op|pre&s;&s;ions: hoping thereby to quiet the People, and to divert them from demanding a Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their Religion and Laws under the &s;helter of our Arms; They do al&s;o give out, that we
<PB N="16" REF="039251_0016_1013FA03E13484D0">
do intend to conquer &amp; en&s;lave the Nation, &amp; therefore it is that we have thought fit to add a few words to our Declaration.</P>
<P>We are confident that no per&s;ons can have &s;uch hard thoughts of us, as to imagine that we have any other De&s;ign in this &V;n|dertaking, than to procure a &s;ettlement of the Religion &amp; of the Liberties &amp; Properties of the Subjects upon &s;o &s;ure a Foundation, that there may be no danger of the Nations relap&s;ing into the like mi&s;eries at any time hereafter. And as the forces that we have brought along with us, are utterly di&s;proportioned to that wicked De&s;ign of conquering the Nation, if we were capable of Intending it, &s;o the great Numbers of the Principal Nobility &amp; Gentry, that are Men of Eminent Quality &amp; E&s;tates, &amp; per&s;ons of known Inte|grity &amp; Zeal both for the Religion &amp; Government of <HI>England,</HI> many of them being al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their con&s;tant fidelity to the Crown, who do both accompany us in this Expedition, &amp; have earne&s;tly &s;olicited us to it, will cover us from all &s;uch Malicious In&s;inuations: For it is not to be imagined, that either tho&s;e who have Invited us, or tho&s;e that are already come to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, can joyn in a wicked attempt of Conque&s;t, to make void their own lawful Titles to their Honours, E&s;tates &amp; Intere&s;ts, We are al&s;o confident that all men &s;ee how little weight there is to be laid, on all Pro|mi&s;es &amp; Engagements that can be now made: &s;ince there has been &s;o little regard had in time pa&s;t, to the mo&s;t &s;olemn Promi&s;es. And as that imperfect redre&s;s that is now offered, is a plain Confe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Violations of the Government, that we have &s;et forth, &s;o the Defectivene&s;s of it is no le&s;s Apparent: for they lay down nothing which they may not take up at Plea&s;ure: &amp; they re&s;erve entire &amp; not &s;o much as mentioned, their claims &amp; pretences to an Arbitrary &amp; De&s;potick Power; which has been the root of all their Oppre&s;&s;ion, &amp; of the total &s;ubver&s;ion of the Government. And its plain, that there can be no redre&s;s nor Remedy offered but in Parliament: by a Declaration of the Rights of the Subjects that have been Invad|ed: &amp; not by any Pretended Acts of Grace, to which the extremity of their affairs has driven them. Therefore it is that we have thought fit to declare, that we will refer all to a free A&s;&s;embly of the Nation, in a lawful Parliament.</P>
