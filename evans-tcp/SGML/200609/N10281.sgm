<P>IT is become an univer&s;al cu&s;tom for every Author, before he gives him&s;elf up to the fury of the Critics, to make his dying &s;peech in a Preface; in which, according to the u&s;u|al &s;tyle of criminals, he confe&s;&s;es his faults, tells the temptations that led him to the crime of &s;cribbling, gives good advice to the re&s;t of his fraternity, and throws him&s;elf upon the mercy of the Court. The&s;e &s;peeches are com|monly addre&s;&s;ed to a &s;ort of imaginary being, called the <HI>kind, courteous, candid</HI> and &s;ometimes, <HI>benevolent Reader.</HI> Not that I would deny the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a being, as an Epicurean once did of the &s;oul, becau&s;e he could not find an account of it, in the complete zoology of animals. The fir&s;t part of this Poem met with very kind reception from many of this cla&s;s: nor am I concerned lea&s;t the &s;econd &s;hould receive any ill u&s;age from them. Au|thors have much more to fear from readers of a different &s;tamp; and though we are u&s;ually loth to &s;peak out &s;o plainly, the truth is, we &s;hould not make &s;uch long prologues to the Candid, were we a&s;&s;ured of our &s;afety from the attacks of the Malicious. For my own part, being an enemy to ceremony and circumlocution, and having moreover &s;ome out&s;tanding accounts to &s;ettle, I &s;hall directly addre&s;s my&s;elf to this la&s;t kind of Critic;

<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Envious and Malicious Reader.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<HEAD>May it plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, or your Reve|rence; or your Illnature, by what title &s;o|ever dignified and di&s;tingui&s;hed:</HEAD>
<P><HI>AS you have expre&s;&s;ed great re&s;entment a|gain&s;t the fir&s;t part of this Poem and its Author, you might perchance think your|&s;elf &s;lighted, if I &s;hould let the &s;econd come abroad without paying you my proper acknowledgements. I own my&s;elf much your debtor; and am only &s;orry that the number of your brotherhood is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that the world may perhaps think this dedication almo&s;t entirely needle&s;s. Had a grea|ter number &s;hown them&s;elves affected, I &s;hould have had more grounds to hope that the Poem might be u&s;eful. Satire is a medicine very &s;alutary in its effects, but quite unplea&s;ant in its operation; nor do I know a more evident &s;ymptom that the potion has taken its proper effect, than the groans and di&s;tortions of the Patient.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I had the plea&s;ure, my Illnatured Reader, on the fir&s;t publication of my poem, to hear the re|marks made upon it by a clu&s;ter of your fraternity, who might each of them have &s;ate for the picture of</HI> Tom Brainle&s;s. <HI>And as you may have fre|quent
<PB N="vii" REF="013051_0005_0F8FF67716531680">
occa&s;ion to talk again&s;t it your&s;elf, and yet be at &s;ome lo&s;s what to alledge in its reproach, I will do you the favor to acquaint you with the re|&s;ult of their critici&s;ms; in order to &s;ave you the trouble of &s;o much thinking, and a&s;&s;i&s;t you a little in the &s;tyle and expre&s;&s;ion of your re&s;entments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was determined by the meeting,</HI> nem. con. <HI>that the whole piece was low, paltry &s;tuff, and both &s;currilous in the &s;entiments and dirty in the &s;tyle; that it was evident, the Author knew no|thing of language, or ver&s;ification, and was inca|pable of writing with any degree of elegance; that he was an open reviler of the Clergy, and an enemy to truth and learning; that his apparent de&s;ign was to ridicule religion, di&s;grace morality, &s;neer at the pre&s;ent methods of education, and in &s;hort, write a &s;atire upon</HI> Yale-College <HI>and the ten commandments; that he treated the &s;ubject in the mo&s;t partial and prejudiced manner, and mu&s;t certainly be either a Separati&s;t, or a Sandemanian. Though the truth of the a&s;&s;ertions in the poem could not &s;o conveniently be denied, yet much was &s;aid again&s;t the intention of the Author; and it was affirmed that if indeed the world in one or two points was not quite &s;o good, as they could wi&s;h it, yet things in the pre&s;ent &s;tate could never be altered for the better, and it was folly, or mad|ne&s;s alone could propo&s;e it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now to give you as much light as po&s;&s;ible into this matter, I would a&s;&s;ure you, the Author had very little hopes that the world would, in his day, arrive at the point of perfection, from which it is at pre&s;ent he knows not how many leagues di&s;tant; and his expectations are not very &s;anguine, that
<PB N="viii" REF="013051_0006_0F8FF677D8F196F0">
the&s;e pictures of the modern defective manners will do much &s;ervice. He is fully &s;en&s;ible, that the moral World is as difficult to be moved out of its cour&s;e, as the natural; that there is in it as much power of re&s;i&s;tance or</HI> vis inertiae, <HI>as the Philo|&s;ophers term it; and that the projectors are e|qually at a lo&s;s for engines and foothold. He is as much &s;ati&s;fied that the pre&s;ent year hath borne a &s;ufficient number of fools to keep up the breed, as that there has been a tolerable crop produced every &s;ea&s;on, for the&s;e forty years pa&s;t. But he thought, though perhaps the picture might not reclaim ma|ny, there could be no harm in trying his hand at the draught: In which, if the good people, who &s;ate for the painting, have the ill hap to find them|&s;elves drawn with a wide mouth, a long no&s;e, or a blear eye, he begs of them to get a little acquain|ted with their own faces, and &s;ee whether the&s;e be not their real defects of nature, before they begin to rail at the Painter, for the badne&s;s of their re|&s;emblance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I am fully &s;en&s;ible, my Illnatured Reader, that you have good rea&s;ons in your own brea&s;t, to ac|count for your re&s;entment again&s;t my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, and direct you in the manner of your remarks. You ought in gratitude to defend that carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in the examination of Candidates for preaching, to which it is not at all impo&s;&s;ible, but you may your&s;elf be indebted for your reverence and your band. Ju&s;tly may you de&s;pi&s;e the &s;tudy of tho&s;e finer Arts and Sciences, of which, in a &s;mooth journey through life, you never once knew the want, or perceived the advantages: ju&s;tly &s;hould you undervalue them in compari&s;on with that antient Learning, which
<PB N="ix" REF="013051_0007_0F8FF6789938D150">
from experience you rightly term</HI> Solid, <HI>as your own wits were never able to penetrate it. With good rea&s;on al&s;o do you affirm the &s;atire to be level|led at the Clergy in general, &s;ince that a&s;&s;ertion is the be&s;t method of preventing the public from drag|ging to view tho&s;e particular men, at whom it is, and ought to be, pointed; though you might di&s;|cern, with any other eye than that of wilful pre|judice, that the Author hath the highe&s;t veneration for the mini&s;terial robe, or he would never thus trouble him&s;elf about the &s;pots that defile it. As for tho&s;e,</HI> however dignified in &s;tation, <HI>who rail at the Progre&s;s of Dulne&s;s, to gain favour with a particular party, or order of men, he thinks them unworthy the notice of an an&s;wer. He would hint only to &s;uch as hope to &s;creen them&s;elves in the croud, and draw on him the re&s;entment of tho&s;e he e&s;teems, by affirming the &s;atire to be general, that he would thank them, if they would &s;o far throw off the ma&s;k, that by acquiring a right to their names, he may have an opportunity hereafter to render it more particular. He e&s;pecially recom|mends this hint to two Per&s;ons, the haughtie&s;t Dullard, and the mo&s;t impertinent Coxcomb of this age; from whom he has already received number|le&s;s favours, and who by their future good conduct may &s;tand a chance, at &s;ome fortunate period, to figure at the head of a Dedication to the fir&s;t and &s;econd parts of the Progre&s;s of Dulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And new, my Evil Reader, with regard to the Poem before you, which is properly a counterpart to the other, I de&s;ign pretty much to let it &s;peak for it&s;elf. Perhaps, &s;ince I have now endeavour|ed to ridicule and explode both extremes, this &s;e|cond part may a&s;&s;i&s;t you a little to judge what are
<PB N="x" REF="013051_0008_0F8FF6795043DD38">
the &s;entiments I would wi&s;h to enforce: but in plain truth, I have very little hopes of you. Ne|verthele&s;s before I leave you, I will tell you one &s;ecret, and give you a few words of advice. The &s;ecret, which I am &s;ure you would never have been able to di&s;cover, is this; In conformity to the de|licacy of your ta&s;te, I have rai&s;ed the &s;tyle of this part, about two degrees by the &s;cale, higher than the other. The advice is, that it will be no unwi&s;e proceedure in you to hint that the &s;pirit of the piece is not well &s;upported, nor this part half &s;o good as the fir&s;t: and an ob&s;ervation, or two, upon the Author's impudence, &s;ea&s;onably introduced, might not be wholly without effect. But as to the old trite way of calling men, Heretics, Dei&s;ts and Ar|minians, it hath been lately &s;o much hackneyed and worn out by &s;ome Reverend Gentlemen, that I cannot promi&s;e it would do you any manner of &s;ervice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I cannot conclude without declaring to the world in this public manner, that whoever &s;hall take on him&s;elf this character, by criticizing on the&s;e Poems in the method above &s;pecified, &s;hall have my free licence and permi&s;&s;ion to appropriate to him&s;elf the whole of this dedication, and be di&s;tingui&s;hed for the future by the title of my Envious and Ma|licious Reader: and I do a&s;&s;ure him that this pre|face was written purpo&s;ely for him; not de&s;igning however to exclude from a proper &s;hare every one, who &s;hall join with him in tho&s;e &s;entiments, from this fir&s;t day of January, new &s;tyle, A. D.</HI> 1773, <HI>henceforth, and as long as the world &s;hall endure, be the &s;ame term longer or &s;horter.</HI></P>

<L>How pale the pal&s;ied Fop appears,</L>
<L>Low-&s;hivring in the vale of years;</L>
<L>The gho&s;t of all his former days,</L>
<L>When folly lent the ear of prai&s;e.</L>
<L>And Beaus with pleas'd attention hung</L>
<L>On accents of his chatt'ring tongue.</L>
<L>Now all tho&s;e days of plea&s;ure o'er,</L>
<L>That chatt'ring tongue mu&s;t prate no more.</L>
<L>From ev'ry place, that ble&s;s'd his hopes,</L>
<L>He's elbow'd out by younger Fops.</L>
<L>Each plea&s;ing thought unknown, that chears</L>
<L>The &s;adne&s;s of declining years,</L>
<L>In lonely age he &s;inks forlorn,</L>
<L>Of all, and ev'n him&s;elf, the &s;corn.</L>

<L>The Coxcomb's cour&s;e were wondrous clever,</L>
<L>Would health and money la&s;t forever,</L>
<L>Did Con&s;cience never break the charm,</L>
<L>Nor fears of future worlds alarm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But oh, &s;ince youth and years decay,</L>
<L>And life's vain follies fleet away,</L>
<L>Since Age has no re&s;pect for Beaus,</L>
<L>And Death the gaudy &s;cene mu&s;t clo&s;e,</L>
<L>Happy the Man, who&s;e early bloom</L>
<L>Provides for endle&s;s years to come;</L>
<L>That learning &s;eeks, who&s;e u&s;eful gain</L>
<L>Repays the cour&s;e of &s;tudious pain,</L>
<L>Who&s;e fame the thankful age &s;hall rai&s;e,</L>
<L>And future times repeat its prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Attains that heart-felt peace of mind,</L>
<L>To all the will of heav'n re&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>Which calms in youth, the bla&s;t of rage,</L>
<L>Adds &s;weete&s;t hope to &s;inking age,</L>
<L>With valued u&s;e prolongs the breath,</L>
<L>And gives a placid &s;mile to death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let us &s;corn the prai&s;e that &s;prings</L>
<L>From gaudy, &s;ublunary things.</L>
<L>Hate the vain joys, that vice can claim,</L>
<L>To nobler thoughts exalt our aim,</L>
<L>With ardour &s;eek th' immortal prize,</L>
<L>And &s;eize our portion in the &s;kies.</L>
