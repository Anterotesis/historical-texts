</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO e&s;tabli&s;h on firm foundations the Happine&s;s of Society is evidently one of the mo&s;t important concerns of man. If the attainment of that happine&s;s be highly de&s;irable, the perpetuation of it mu&s;t be more de&s;irable. Its daily value is daily renewed, during its continuance; and, when extended through a century, it is mathematically proved to be of a hundred times the value, which it would po&s;&s;e&s;s, if extended only through a year.</P>
<P>The mind of man, in&s;tinctively realizing this truth, has ever laboured rather to &s;ecure, than to obtain, hap|pine&s;s, both public and private. The attainment is u&s;ually not a difficult ta&s;k, the e&s;tabli&s;hment a Hercu|lean one. A free government has been always, and ju&s;tly, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a primary &s;ource of national hap|pine&s;s. To form &s;uch a government has been found &s;ufficiently ea&s;y; but to render it durable has been ever con&s;idered as a problem of very difficult &s;olution. Yet in its durability plainly con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t all the value of &s;uch a government. Hence mo&s;t of the political know|ledge and labour of freemen has been employed, and exhau&s;ted, in endeavouring to give &s;tability to their re|&s;pective
<PB N="6" REF="028610_0006_0FD9C5D266A3D880">
political &s;y&s;tems. Hence have ari&s;en the nu|merous checks, balances, and divi&s;ions of power and influence, found in our own political con&s;titutions, and in tho&s;e of &s;everal other nations. In other nations, the&s;e means have been generally in&s;ufficient to accompli&s;h the end. Whether they will i&s;&s;ue more happily in our own is uncertain. In &s;everal in&s;tances, we &s;eem to have approached the verge of di&s;&s;olution; but we have providentially withdrawn, before the &s;ea&s;on of &s;afety was pa&s;&s;ed. Men of exten&s;ive political information, and &s;agacious foreca&s;t, have frequently trembled for our na|tional exi&s;tence; and, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome favourable interpo&s;itions of Providence in our behalf, they &s;till wait anxiou&s;ly to know what the end will be. Should we fall, the faire&s;t hopes of wi&s;e and good men will be bla&s;ted; the maxim, That mankind cannot be governed without force and violence, will &s;tand on higher proof, and be advanced with new and triumphant confidence; and the great body of civilized men will probably &s;it down in &s;ullen and melancholy conviction, that nations cannot, unle&s;s circum&s;cribed by Alps, or oceans, be per|manently free.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t nations, and mo&s;t politicians, have con&s;idered Arms and Wealth, as primary means of continuing na|tional happine&s;s. To this opinion they have probably been led by the allurements of avarice and ambition, by the power of cu&s;tom, and by a per&s;ua&s;ion, ea&s;ily imbib|ed, that grandeur and happine&s;s are &s;ynonymous. All the&s;e are deceitful guides, and have in this in&s;tance con|ducted only to error.</P>
<P>As means of defence, arms are evidently nece&s;&s;ary to national &s;afety, and, of cour&s;e, to the permanence of na|tional happine&s;s; but, as means of conque&s;t, they are u&s;ually the &s;ource of national ruin. States of moderate &s;ize, uninclined to military enterpri&s;e, and unambitious of high di&s;tinction, appear to have realized more happi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="7" REF="028610_0007_0FD9C6118CE56C10">
than tho&s;e of a contrary character. Widely ex|tended dominions are too unwieldy an object, to be man|aged with either &s;kill, or &s;ucce&s;s; and power, diffu&s;ed over a large territory, le&s;&s;ens at every &s;tage of its diffu|&s;ion. A greater and greater mixture of nations and tribes, once independent and impatient of &s;ubjugation, of different manners, religions, and intere&s;ts, and pre|vented from uniting by prejudice and hatred, by impe|rious domination and irritated dependence, is continually accumulated, at every &s;tride of conque&s;t; and, like the iron and clay in the prophecy, though carefully moulded into a fair and regular form, is preparing to crumble, under the hand of the Former.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of government, al&s;o, and its nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures by becoming daily more complicated, become daily more perplexing. The public concerns are too numerous, the public officers, in opinions, characters, and intere&s;ts, too various, the opportunities of &s;ecure op|pre&s;&s;ion too ea&s;y, and the neglects of duty too frequent, to allow of any po&s;&s;ible firmne&s;s, or con&s;i&s;tency. The pile, however &s;kilfully erected, and con&s;tantly repaired, is by the increa&s;e of its own weight precipitated to the ground.</P>
<P>From great accumulations of Wealth the &s;ame evil is derived with not le&s;s certainty, and in methods not very di&s;&s;imilar. Avarice is one of tho&s;e <HI>daughters of the hor&s;e-leach, which ince&s;&s;antly cry, "give, give</HI>;" it is eminent|ly <HI>the fire, which &s;aith not, "it is enough.</HI>" The love of property increa&s;es in a more rapid proportion, than the property it&s;elf, In a country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e wealth, places in government are, of nece&s;&s;ity, highly lucrative, and, of cour&s;e, the objects of ardent de&s;ire. To attain them, no principles, no efforts, are e&s;teemed too great a &s;acrifice. Sycophancy, &s;ervility, bribery, perjury, and numberle&s;s other &s;pectres of vice, haunt all &s;eats of power and tru&s;t, and force the friends of public integrity to retire with alarm and di&s;couragement. Hone&s;ty is no longer
<PB N="8" REF="028610_0008_0FD9C5D386D315E8">
counterfeited; but laughed at. Con&s;cience is not &s;i|lenced; but di&s;carded. Po&s;ts of honour, are to&s;&s;ed out for a &s;cramble; and truth, ju&s;tice, and the public wel|fare, are vendued to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>On per&s;onal manners the effects are no le&s;s unhappy. Stimulated by avarice, and called onward by the com|manding voice of cu&s;tom, every man makes gold his god. To acquire riches becomes the only object, ho|nour, or duty. By his wealth every man's worth is &s;ealed. Wealth is virtue; and poverty vice. The means of acqui&s;ition are, therefore, &s;anctified by the acknowledged importance of the end. Extortion, fraud, gaming, and peculation, &s;teal into character, under the impo&s;ing names of indu&s;try and prudence, and whiten into virtues, in the &s;un&s;hine, with which opulence is &s;ur|rounded.</P>
<P>In the mean time, luxury holds out to appetite his &s;tore of various and &s;ickly confections, and per&s;uades tho&s;e, who are prepared to be per&s;uaded, that &s;en&s;e is the only &s;ource of real good, and that to eat and drink is the chief end of man. Enfeebled by &s;loth, deba&s;ed by indulgence, and gro&s;s with a perpetual pro&s;titution of ta&s;te and of talents, the rational character becomes a&s;&s;imilated to the animal one, and man claims a new and more intimate kindred to the &s;wine.</P>
<P>Parade and appearance, al&s;o, invite and engro&s;s the na|tional attention. Hou&s;es, gardens, equipage, and dre&s;s, take the place of duty and worth; and from the prince to the pea&s;ant the great ambition is to &s;hine. Arts of ornament eject tho&s;e of u&s;e; and manners of manline&s;s and dignity give place to ceremony and profe&s;&s;ion. E|ducation, in&s;tead of enlightening the under&s;tanding and forming the heart, is employed in gracing the per&s;on and &s;uppling the limbs; and in&s;tead of teaching truth, implanting virtue and fa&s;hioning to worth by &s;ober di&s;|cipline, habituating care, and per&s;ua&s;ive example, ter|minates
<PB N="9" REF="028610_0009_0FD9C615B67F81F0">
all her labours in accompli&s;hing for the dance and the drawing room. Children, are of cour&s;e, led out of the path of rea&s;on and duty into the by-ways of ap|pearance and &s;en&s;e, are conducted to the theatre and not to the church, and, while they are expected to become men and women, dwindle, with a regular diminution, into fribbles and dolls.</P>
<P>Thus the influence of enormous Wealth, and of ex|tended Conque&s;t, is equally pernicious to the Magi&s;trate, and to the &s;ubject; and the national character becomes tainted, of cour&s;e, with &s;ickline&s;s and corruption.</P>
<P>The experience of mankind has effectually elucidated the truth of the&s;e remarks. Greece, Rome, and the great nations of modern Europe, are all evident proofs of the intimate connection between Conque&s;t and ruin; and Carthage and Holland are &s;trong exhibitions of the peri&s;hing nature of &s;ociety, which re&s;ts on the &s;pe|cious and treacherous &s;upport of unlimited Commerce.</P>
<P>The plans of tho&s;e, who hitherto have chiefly planned for mankind, appear to have been formed principally for the purpo&s;e of fixing &s;ecurely that &s;tate of &s;ociety, which they found, and little, if at all, for its melioration. For this end, they appear to have aimed merely to &s;trength|en the exi&s;ting government again&s;t inva&s;ion and in&s;ur|rection. Men, they &s;eem to have &s;uppo&s;ed, mu&s;t con|tinue to be what they found them; ignorant, vicious, and unhappy. To render them as quiet as po&s;&s;ible, in that &s;tate, is naturally concluded to have been the highe&s;t object of their policy, &s;o far as it is exhibited in hi&s;tory. Hence they laboured much to con&s;olidate the elements of the government, and to &s;ecure to it that reverence, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;trength, which promi&s;ed undi&s;puted do|minion. When the promotion of &s;cience became a part of the political &s;y&s;tem, it was principally adopted, for the purpo&s;e of qualifying individuals to govern, and furni&s;hing u&s;eful agents to tho&s;e who governed, in the
<PB N="10" REF="028610_0010_0FD9C5DB6E4B16E8">
pro&s;ecution of their mea&s;ures; and rarely, and &s;cantily, for the purpo&s;e of improving the ma&s;s of men. The Object was not &s;o &s;o rule, as to engro&s;s the e&s;teem and affection of &s;ubjects; or to enable them to know when they were &s;o ruled, as to make their rulers the proper ob|jects of their e&s;teem and affection. The Object was not to prepare &s;ubjects by information, happine&s;s, and vir|tue, to under&s;tand, to love, and to pre&s;erve their &s;tate&punc; but to make them quiet in that &s;tate, whether di&s;po&s;ed, or indi&s;po&s;ed. Hence, policy became an art; and go|vernment a trick. Rulers were employed in plotting again&s;t their &s;ubjects; and &s;ubjects either quietly &s;unk into torpid in&s;en&s;ibility, or, awakened by oppre&s;&s;ion ex|tended beyond every bound, ro&s;e to in&s;urrection and madne&s;s.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem, though it has been almo&s;t the only hu|man &s;y&s;tem, has never appeared to be of real u&s;e to man. It has often defeated it&s;elf, and fru&s;trated the de&s;igns of tho&s;e, by whom it has been adopted. A&s;&s;yria, Per&s;ia, Macedon, Rome, and France, are all proofs, that care|fully &s;upported, as it has been by all the arts of policy, and the utmo&s;t accumulation of power, it has &s;till &s;own in it&s;elf the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;olution; and that tho&s;e, whom it was intended to aggrandize, have fallen into the &s;ame gulph of perdition, with tho&s;e whom it was intended to en&s;lave. The Character of the ma&s;s of people, in each of tho&s;e monarchies, was the real cau&s;e of its political ruin; and the nature of the political &s;y&s;tem was as really a principal cau&s;e of that character. In Africa, where Oppre&s;&s;ion has more effectually wielded her iron rod, and where man has been more entirely &s;horne of his in|tellectual dignity, a more uniform cour&s;e of &s;ociety has been accompli&s;hed. But here quietne&s;s has exi&s;ted with|out happine&s;s; a &s;tagnant lake, filled with pollution and death; and nations, commuting rea&s;on for in&s;tinct have &s;hrunk into brutes. In India, and in China, where the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem has long, tho' not uninterruptedly prevailed,
<PB N="11" REF="028610_0011_0FD9C61736649F20">
the inhabitants have indeed ri&s;en to higher grades of manual ingenuity, but, as moral beings, are nearly on the &s;ame level.</P>
<P>Under the influence of freedom, man has been rou&s;ed from this lethargy, and &s;haken him&s;elf with a returning con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of energy and action. In this &s;uperior &s;ituation, his powers, his views, his efforts, enlarged with a portentous growth; but they grew chiefly by the aid of &s;oil, climate, and accident. The cultivation which they received, was the cultivation of chance, of pa&s;&s;ion, and of appetite; not of &s;y&s;tem, wi&s;dom, or vir|tue. Greece became a Giant in war, in &s;cience, and in arts; but was &s;till an infant in moral improvement, and u&s;eful policy. No regular plan of amending the human character appears to have been thought of by her mo&s;t admired &s;ages; and, while her efforts in the field, and in the &s;tudy, awed mankind to a&s;toni&s;hment, her citizens were merely a collection of &s;uperiour &s;avages. Their depravity a&s;&s;umed, indeed, a more elegant form, but not an e&s;&s;entially different character. Rome &s;y&s;tematized, and in a higher degree than any other State has ever done, war, oppre&s;&s;ion, and deva&s;tation. Her govern|ment, al&s;o, was more &s;kilfully adju&s;ted, and more firmly compacted, than the Grecian &s;y&s;tems; but it was &s;till to&s;&s;ed by tumult, and &s;hattered by frequent violence. Her citizens were left to the &s;ame accidental improve|ment; and, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a more &s;pecious &s;tateli|ne&s;s than tho&s;e of Greece, were deba&s;ed with the &s;ame gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and immanity. Accu&s;tomed, from our infan|cy, to &s;tudy their hi&s;tory, to admire their talents, and to celebrate their exploits, we are prone to form a different e&s;timate of the&s;e nations; yet by a very moderate exam|ination we &s;hall find, that they furni&s;h us many things to admire, but few to approve, that, as moral beings, they are di&s;tingui&s;hed with little advantage from various na|tions whom they contemptuou&s;ly &s;tyled barbarians. In|deed, one of the fir&s;t political errors of later ages ap|pears
<PB N="12" REF="028610_0012_0FD9C5DF22F00FB0">
to be too high a re&s;pect for the &s;tate of &s;ociety in Greece and Rome.</P>
<P>There is, I believe, a more rational policy, beginning with a different aim, and pur&s;uing public quiet in a no|bler and more effectual manner. The primary mean of originating and e&s;tabli&s;hing happine&s;s, in free commu|nities, is, I imagine, the formation of a good per&s;onal character in their citizens. Good citizens mu&s;t of cour&s;e con&s;titute a happier community than bad ones, and mu&s;t better under&s;tand the nature and cau&s;es of their happi|ne&s;s. They may &s;afely be governed by a milder policy, and cannot but be better judges of the de&s;irablene&s;s of &s;uch policy. More the children of rea&s;on, and le&s;s the &s;laves of appetite and pa&s;&s;ion, they will naturally be more &s;atisfied with real happine&s;s, and le&s;s allured, by that, which, however &s;hewy, is un&s;ub&s;tantial; will need fewer re&s;trictions, and be more contented under &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary; will prize more highly &s;uch liberty, as is &s;uited to the condition of man, and proportionally di&s;|regard that, which is Utopian. Hence, &s;uch citizens may probably be governed by ju&s;tice, and Common-&s;en&s;e; and will not nece&s;&s;itate the adoption of force and oppre&s;&s;ion, or the employment of circumvention and &s;tatecraft.</P>
<P>A family is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, a &s;tate in miniature. Children of bad per&s;onal characters can &s;carcely be gov|erned at all, and never, without con&s;tant exertions of terror and force. Children of a good character are ea|&s;ily &s;wayed, without either. Mild and equitable mea|&s;ures, few and gentle interpo&s;itions of mere authority, united with argument and per&s;ua&s;ion, will, in a family compo&s;ed of &s;uch children, effectually e&s;tabli&s;h dome&s;tic order, peace, and happine&s;s. This difference of regu|lations, this exemption from the nece&s;&s;ity of exerting force and in&s;piring terror, depends wholly on the char|acter of tho&s;e, who are to be governed. To a State
<PB N="13" REF="028610_0013_0FD9C618C49C38B8">
the&s;e truths are not le&s;s applicable. If the per&s;onal character of its citizens were perfectly good, there would be neither nece&s;&s;ity, nor opportunity, of governing by force. That train of penalties, which con&s;titutes a great part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of every Legi&s;lature, and of the con|tents of every &s;tatute book, would cea&s;e to exi&s;t, as it would cea&s;e to be nece&s;&s;ary; and the mere expre&s;&s;ion of the public will would execute it&s;elf. The Sheriff would enjoy a &s;inecure, and the jail moulder without an in|habitant.</P>
<P>On this general principle was the prophecy of the Text written. Wi&s;dom and knowledge, the prophet declares, &s;hall, at &s;ome future period, &s;ome period which I apprehend to be &s;till future, be the &s;tability of the times, to which he refers: i. e. the public &s;tability of the age; of one, or of more than one nation: or, in other words, the means of e&s;tabli&s;hing on firm founda|tions public happine&s;s.</P>
<P>By Wi&s;dom, all Per&s;ons who read the Bible know, the Sacred Writers commonly intend Virtue; and Vir|tue in that enlarged and Evangelical &s;en&s;e, which em|braces Piety to God, Good-will to mankind, and the effectual Government of our&s;elves. "The fear of the Lord," &s;aid Jehovah, when di&s;clo&s;ing this ine&s;timable and hitherto unexplored &s;ubject, "that is Wi&s;dom." "The fear of the Lord," &s;ays Solomon, (Heb.) is the <HI>chief part</HI> of Wi&s;dom." "The Wi&s;dom, that is from above," &s;ays James, "is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gen|tle, ea&s;y to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocri&s;y." As Wi&s;|dom is properly defined to be that attribute of mind, which aims at the be&s;t ends, and choo&s;es the be&s;t means to accompli&s;h them; &s;o Virtue, which &s;teadily aims at the Glory of God, the Good of mankind, and the Good of our&s;elves, the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible ends, and which more na|turally than any other di&s;po&s;ition directs to the be&s;t means
<PB N="14" REF="028610_0014_0FD9C5E3A3C04860">
of accompli&s;hing them, was, with peculiar propriety, &s;tyled Wi&s;dom by the penmen of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>Virtue may be defined&mdash;The Love of doing good. It will be ea&s;ily &s;een from this definition, if allowed to be ju&s;t, that it can be but one indivi&s;ible Attribute of mind. Yet, as the objects, towards which it is exerci&s;|ed, are materially different, it has been divided, for the purpo&s;es of con&s;ideration, into the three great branches already mentioned. It ought to be ob&s;erved, that it is not a pa&s;&s;ion, nor an aggregate of pa&s;&s;ions; but a prin|ciple, or di&s;po&s;ition, habitual, active, and governing. It is the mental energy, directed &s;teadily to that which is right.</P>
<P>God, the greate&s;t object in the Univer&s;e, and infinite|ly more important and worthy than all others, demands, of cour&s;e, the &s;upreme regard of every rational being. The fir&s;t, the mo&s;t obligatory, and the mo&s;t noble exer|ci&s;e of Virtue is the Love and Reverence of this Glori|ous Being, generally termed Piety.</P>
<P>Our fellow creatures, collectively, form the next great object of our regard. Virtue, exerci&s;ed towards them, has very properly been denominated Good-will or Bene|volence; a name de&s;criptive of all right affections to|wards them, and including ju&s;tice, faithfulne&s;s, kindne&s;s, truth, forgivene&s;s, and all tho&s;e, which, are frequently &s;tyled the Social Virtues.</P>
<P>To him&s;elf every Man is al&s;o an important object of regard. Virtue, as exerci&s;ed towards our&s;elves, includes every ju&s;t de&s;ire and vindicable pur&s;uit of our real good; but it is principally employed in regulating and confin|ing within due bounds our appetites and pa&s;&s;ions; prin|ciples in the human mind, which perpetually prompt to wrong, and which, without a continual and vigorous re|&s;traint, invariably di&s;honour God, injure our fellow men, and ruin our&s;elves. Thus exerci&s;ed, Virtue is termed Temperance, or Self-government.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="028610_0015_0FD9C5E10B53DF30">It is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to remark to this Audience, that all human conduct &s;prings from the human will; that this is the only active principle in man; and that, as the will is directed to good, or evil, right, or wrong, man invariably does that, which is evil, or that which is good. The real importance of Virtue to the happine&s;s of Society lies in this; that Virtue is an uniform direc|tion of the will to that which is good. When man is virtuous, therefore, his di&s;po&s;ition, the &s;ource of all his conduct, being &s;teadily pointed to that, which is good, and right, his conduct mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be al&s;o right and good. Hence Virtue of nece&s;&s;ity aims at the happine&s;s of Society. A man's private intere&s;t may, for a time, and in his own view, be promoted by wrong; but the intere&s;ts of a community can never be, for a moment, promoted but by that which is right. A &s;elfi&s;h, &s;epa|rate intere&s;t cla&s;hes with that of every neighbour, and cannot be advanced, but to the injury of the common good. Avarice always robs; ambition always oppre&s;|&s;es; and &s;en&s;uality always wounds. Virtue, on the con|trary, invariably &s;eeks the common welfare, and gives no pain, where it is not indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the promotion of that welfare.</P>
<P>Virtue is, al&s;o, a principle &s;ufficiently powerful and ac|tive to make all the happine&s;s, which Society can enjoy. It is the whole energy of the Deity; and of every perfect being; and may become the whole energy of man. It often has become &s;ufficiently powerful to produce the highe&s;t &s;elf-denial, of which man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate is capable; and is not uncommonly of &s;uch &s;trength, as to con&s;titute the only active character. Greater exertions have rarely &s;prung from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, than have &s;prung from virtue. The labours of Alfred were not inferior to tho&s;e of Cae&s;ar; nor were tho&s;e of the proude&s;t and mo&s;t ambitious Philo&s;opher to be named with tho&s;e of Paul.</P>
<P>As Virtue is the genuine, the invariable, and the effi|cient &s;ource of public happine&s;s, &s;o it is in the &s;ame de|gree
<PB N="16" REF="028610_0016_0FD9C5E4CD326B00">
its &s;tability. As it is its natural tendency to pro|duce happine&s;s, &s;o this is always and equally its tendency. Wherever, and how long &s;oever, it exi&s;ts, the happine&s;s, of which it is the parent, will al&s;o exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Good-will to Mankind, accompli&s;hes directly mo&s;t of tho&s;e de&s;irable objects, at which the political Con&s;titu|tions, and the Laws, of Society aim; It makes men hone&s;t, ju&s;t, faithful, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to government, and friendly to each other, without re&s;trictions, or puni&s;h|ments; and renders magi&s;trates equitable, public &s;pirit|ed, and merciful, without checks, factions, or rebellions. And all this it can accompli&s;h, without labour, or ex|pen&s;e, without force, turmoil or terrour.</P>
<P>Self-government, on the other hand, effectually re|&s;trains from all tho&s;e evils in Society, to prevent which is the principal employment of Laws and of Magi&s;trates. With far more efficacy, and incomparably more ea&s;e, than the po&s;t and the pri&s;on, the gibbet and the cro&s;s, does it deter from fraud, revenge, impurity, theft, robbery, trea|&s;on, and rebellion. At the &s;ame time, it guards from ten thou&s;and other evils, which no Law can re&s;train, and which, often, are not le&s;s pernicious to Society, than tho&s;e overt and glaring acts, which are the objects of ju|dicial deci&s;ion. Its influence on the Magi&s;trate is equal|ly propitious; nor are the private evils, which I have &s;pecified more effectually prevented, than the exten&s;ive and enormous mi&s;chiefs of corruption, peculation, and tyranny.</P>
<P>With regard to the advantage and nece&s;&s;ity of Good-will to public happine&s;s, there has never been any debate, except that, which re&s;pects all Virtue, viz. Whether it is nece&s;&s;ary, that men &s;hould be principled to pur&s;ue the good of Society; or whether it is &s;ufficient, to require the actions conducive to this end, without any regard to the principle. This que&s;tion I &s;hall di&s;cu&s;s in the &s;equel.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028610_0017_0FD9C61C94DA4D78">With regard to the nece&s;&s;ity of Self-government to the happine&s;s of Society a debate has always exi&s;ted. In every Community men are found, who &s;teadily in&s;i&s;t, that the indulgence of tho&s;e de&s;ires which are appro|priately termed Appetites is ju&s;tifiable, and in no way noxious to the public good. Were men brutes, and connected on equal terms with a republic of &s;wine, goats, and &s;wift-peters, this &s;entiment would at lea&s;t plead &s;ome pretence in its behalf; and Rea&s;on would not be oblig|ed &s;o often to blu&s;h for the human character, when it read, to this effect, the labours of infidel philosophers, or heard the conver&s;ation of equally rational &s;en&s;uali&s;ts.</P>
<P>The man of &s;loth, the drone of Society, who adds no|thing to the common &s;tock, and lives on the labours and &s;poils of others, might yet be borne, were not his &s;loth the flood-gate of wickedne&s;s. Idle to do good, he is a pattern of indu&s;try in doing evil. In his merely &s;lothful character, every mor&s;el, which he ta&s;tes, is the plunder of his neighbour, and every act of his enjoyment a de|predation on Society. To con&s;ole them for the inju&s;tice, with a re&s;tle&s;s mind, and hands diligent in mi&s;chief, he con&s;umes his time, and employs his talents, in gambling, hor&s;eracing, cheating, &s;tealing, receiving from thieves, corrupting youth, di&s;turbing good order, and pur&s;uing an univer&s;al round of noxious labours and pernicious diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>If idlene&s;s, prodigality, the ruin of health, reputation, and u&s;efulne&s;s, the depravation of every mental and bodi|ly faculty, the mortification of friends, the de&s;truction of the peace, comfort, and hopes, of his family, and the exhibition of a contagious and pe&s;tilential example, are not injurious to a Community, the drunkard, and the glutton, will undoubtedly &s;tand on new ground, and may with new confidence bring forward a putrid carca&s;e, and a putrid mind, to the public eye, and in&s;i&s;t, that they are &s;ound, u&s;eful, and healthy members of the Body politic.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028610_0018_0FD9C5EC6042FCC8">The man of lewdne&s;s is in a condition even le&s;s hope|ful. He uncea&s;ingly &s;catters fire-brands, arrows, and death, on all around him. He profe&s;&s;es, indeed, to be in &s;port, and merely to pur&s;ue his own amu&s;ement; but the &s;ufferings of tho&s;e, who are unhappily within his reach, make that amu&s;ement a very &s;erious concern to them. He lives but to injure, and acts but to de|&s;troy. The burglar plunders the pur&s;e; the murderer cuts off the life, and hurries his unhappy victim to an untimely grave. The man of Lewdne&s;s robs the parent of his child, the hu&s;band of his wife, and the family of their mother; murders hou&s;hold peace, character, and happine&s;s; plunges the dagger of death into the &s;oul, and hurries the victim of his lu&s;t into the aby&s;s of the damned. The plunder of the burglar may be recover|ed, or the lo&s;s may be borne: the victim of the mur|derer may live beyond the grave, and the unhappy mourners may with this hope &s;oothe their excruciating &s;orrows: but no means can re&s;tore, no mind can &s;u&s;tain, the plunder of peace; no bal&s;am was ever found for the ulcer of infamy; no &s;kill can rebuild a ruined fami|ly; nor can any arti&s;t repair the wrecks of a &s;oul. Such is the innocence of the Leacher; and, were not too great multitudes intere&s;ted in protecting and conniving at vice, the chace of the wolf and the tyger would be forgotten, and he, in their &s;tead, would be hunted from the re&s;i|dence of men.</P>
<P>Piety, the remaining branch of Virtue, although its utility, and its nece&s;&s;ity to public happine&s;s, has been more frequently que&s;tioned, and denied, is, probably at lea&s;t as u&s;eful, and as nece&s;&s;ary to this object, as either of the other branches. It will, I pre&s;ume, be allowed to be wholly rational, and probable, that there are, with|in the limits of the creation, worlds, where the Creator is wholly re&s;pected according to his character; and where infinite greatne&s;s and excellence not only de|mand, but obtain, a love, reverence, and obedience, &s;uit|ed
<PB N="19" REF="028610_0019_0FD9C61DEC086E30">
to their nature. That there is one &s;uch world, the Bible directly declares. In &s;uch a world, it is evident, Piety is the whole &s;ource of order, peace, and happine&s;s. Perfect it&s;elf, it there renders the whole moral &s;y&s;tem perfect, and &s;pontaneou&s;ly produces that obedience to the divine government, which is le&s;s effectually produc|ed here by threatenings and judgments. As Piety is the foundation, in that world, of the order and peace, on which all &s;ocial happine&s;s depends, it is rationally con|cluded, that it mu&s;t be the natural foundation, in any other world, of proportional order and peace; and that, &s;o far as it exi&s;ts, it will benefit earth, as well as heaven, men, as well as angels, and any particular na|tion, as well as mankind in general. In other words, as Piety appears to be the foundation of the mo&s;t per|fect intellectual happine&s;s; &s;o it is to be deemed the real, the natural, and the univer&s;al foundation of &s;ocial good.</P>
<P>From Piety, al&s;o, the other exerci&s;es of Virtue derive a higher di&s;tinction, are pre&s;ented with &s;tronger motives, and enforced by more &s;olemn &s;anctions, than can &s;pring from any other &s;ource.</P>
<P>All the duties which we owe to mankind, are, with|out the con&s;ideration of Piety, viewed as merely due to men; worms of the du&s;t, beings of ye&s;terday, and child|ren of vanity and &s;in. To &s;uch beings moral obligati|on, though real, mu&s;t be of comparatively little import|ance, and operate with little force. But in the eye of Piety all the&s;e duties are enhanced, beyond mea&s;ure, by the con&s;ideration, that they are enjoined by God, and that, of cour&s;e, every fulfilment of moral obligation to our neighbour is the performance of a duty to our Ma|ker. The &s;ame remarks are, with equal force, applied to the duties of Self-government. As much greater, therefore, as much more excellent, and as much more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a right to require our &s;ervice, as God is,
<PB N="20" REF="028610_0020_0FD9C5EDC778B070">
than men, ju&s;t &s;o much more importance, and di&s;tinc|tion, does Piety give to the&s;e branches of Virtue, than they could otherwi&s;e receive.</P>
<P>The principal motives to virtue are evidently the plea|&s;ure found in the practice of it&mdash;the e&s;teem, affection, and beneficence which it excites in our fellow creatures&mdash; the approbation and love of God&mdash;and the expectation of future rewards and puni&s;hments. The two fir&s;t of the&s;e motives mu&s;t certainly operate with as great, and the two la&s;t with much greater influence, on Piety, than on any other &s;uppo&s;able character. To the eye of Piety God appears, as a Being totally different from that, which is u&s;u|ally formed by every other eye. His character is inve&s;ted with an importance wholly new. His approbation, love, and rewards, on the one hand, and his abhorrence, anger, and puni&s;hments, on the other, appear as objects real and boundle&s;s. Primary objects of attention, they be|come primary concerns; and are not only &s;een by con|clu&s;ion, but directly felt to involve all the intere&s;ts of man. Hence they become the directory of thought, and the law of action.</P>
<P>A clear and fixed &s;en&s;e of moral obligation is, proba|bly, in the opinion of mo&s;t men, indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the di&s;charge of the duties, and to the production of the happine&s;s of Society. But &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, it is pre|&s;umed, is to be looked for in Piety alone. The &s;trength of moral obligation lies wholly in the conviction, that a con&s;tant adherence to it is obedience to the will of God. But almo&s;t all the regard, which is rendered to God, or to his will, is rendered by the pious. Imperfect and de|&s;ultory feelings of this nature, feelings which are yet of no &s;mall importance, will generally be found, where a religious education has given birth to ju&s;t moral &s;enti|ments; and e&s;pecially where general influence and ex|ample, united with public in&s;truction, have cultivated &s;uch &s;entiments into habit. Beyond the&s;e limits nothing can be expected, nothing is commonly profe&s;&s;ed, and
<PB N="21" REF="028610_0021_0FD9C6228D8388A0">
nothing will ever be found, be&s;ide the changing power of fa&s;hionable opinion, the &s;lippery dependence of per|&s;onal honour, and the accidental coincidence of &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s with duty.</P>
<P>The great &s;upport of moral obligation, in the pre&s;ent world, is the belief of God's moral government, of our accountablene&s;s to him, and of an approaching &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments. The de&s;ire of happine&s;s, and the dread of mi&s;ery, is a part of the intelligent, and even of the animal nature, and is in&s;eparable from the faculty of perception. As all happine&s;s, and all mi&s;ery, are ulti|mately derived from the hand of God, and as no bounds can be &s;et to the degree, or the continuance, of either, be&s;ide tho&s;e, which he is plea&s;ed to &s;et, this object comes home to every heart with a power totally peculiar. Its efficacy reaches all places, times, and per&s;ons: all per|&s;ons, I mean, be&s;ide the fool, who hath &s;aid in his heart, "There is no God." Its &s;uperiour efficacy on men of piety I have already explained.</P>
<P>In a world, like this, where the depravity of man is proclaimed by every Law, is engraven on the altars of every Religion, and is written with a pen of adamant on the iron page of Hi&s;tory, how de&s;irable is it, that this great motive to duty, this great &s;anction of moral obli|gation, &s;hould, in&s;tead of being le&s;&s;ened by &s;ophi&s;try, ri|dicule, and neglect, be pre&s;erved and &s;trengthened to the utmo&s;t, to &s;ave Society from tho&s;e numerous evils, of which it is the only remedy, and to prompt men to tho&s;e indi&s;pen&s;able duties, to which it is often the only effectu|al motive?</P>
<P>In addition to the&s;e ob&s;ervations it may be ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ert|ed, that, without Piety, the other branches of Virtue are never found. There has been no proof either from fact, or from argument, hitherto adduced, to &s;hew, that one branch of Virtue can exi&s;t independently of the others. All the heathens, both individuals and nations, who re|garded
<PB N="22" REF="028610_0022_0FD9C5EE59F22E70">
their fellow men in the mo&s;t equitable manner, and who regulated them&s;elves with the greate&s;t decency, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by reverence for the gods. Among Chri&s;tians, al&s;o, there is no want of evidence, to prove, that impious men are alike de&s;titute of benevolence and &s;elf-government, and that the appearances, which are &s;ound, of the&s;e characteri&s;tics, in tho&s;e who are not pious, are the accidental re&s;ult of convenience, or nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>But the &s;ubject will ea&s;ily, and, I apprehend, perfectly explain it&s;elf. Ju&s;tice in man is the love of that which is ju&s;t. But can he, in whom this principle exi&s;ts, be un|ju&s;t to his Maker? Can he be willing, and principled, to render to Cae&s;ar the things which are Cae&s;ar's, and not to God the things which are God's? Or can any thing be Cae&s;ar's with &s;uch ab&s;olute right, as he, his talents, time, and &s;ervices, are God's? Gratitude is an affection|ate &s;en&s;e of benefits, and a proportionate love to the Be|nefactor. But can any man be grateful to a human, who is not grateful to the Divine, Benefactor? Generally, can a man love intelligent being at all, who does not love the Infinite Intelligent; or be at all virtuous, unle&s;s his virtue be directed primarily to that Being, who is, infi|nitely beyond all others, excellent, lovely and beneficent?</P>
<P>Whether it be de&s;irable for Society, that its members &s;hould be principled to promote its happine&s;s, or not; is a que&s;tion, which cannot be a&s;ked without a blu&s;h, nor an&s;wered without a &s;mile. It is to a&s;k whether it would be better for Society, that its happine&s;s &s;hould be great, &s;table, and &s;ecure; or &s;mall, fluctuating, and accidental. There is no &s;teady &s;ource of public or private good, but principle; and there is, in this &s;en&s;e, no principle, but Virtue. To Virtue public good nece&s;&s;arily appears, and is enjoined by an Authority in&s;tinctively obeyed (the Au|thority of God) as a primary object of regard. To a mind not virtuous it is, of cour&s;e, and alway, an object &s;ubordinate, accidental, and &s;olitary.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="028610_0023_0FD9C625D1FE6260">On the inhabitants of a land, univer&s;ally virtuous, the peculiar ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven may, al&s;o, be rationally ex|pected to de&s;cend. Where human weakne&s;s errs, where human power falters, and where human means prove in|effectual, God may, both on rational and evangelical grounds, be expected to open his beneficent hand, and &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ary good. Here, al&s;o, Virtue may be &s;afely pronounced to be the &s;tability of public happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But it is not enough, that the members of a Society aim at that, which will promote the general good; they mu&s;t al&s;o know what it is. Knowledge is, therefore, with the utmo&s;t propriety de&s;ignated in the text, as ano|ther &s;ource of this &s;tability.</P>
<P>In examining this part of the &s;ubject, it will be u&s;eful to con&s;ider the kind, the diffu&s;ion, and the effects, of that knowledge, which is intended by the Prophet.</P>
<P>It will undoubtedly be conceded, that he intended that knowledge, which is real, and not merely nominal; that, al&s;o, which is practical, and therefore u&s;eful; and, of cour&s;e, that, which is moral, or in other words, the mo&s;t practical, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all real knowledge, and all practical knowledge, is derived either from Experience, or from Revelation. Theories are generally mere dreams, which ought to be placed on the &s;ame level with the profe&s;&s;ed fictions of po|ets, and to be written in ver&s;e, and not in &s;ober pro&s;e. Tho' dignified with the pompous title of Philo&s;ophy, they have u&s;ually, after amu&s;ing the world, a little time, gone down the &s;tream of contempt into the ocean of oblivion. They cannot be practical, becau&s;e they cannot be true; and hence, being of no u&s;e, except to plea&s;e the imagination, they are of cour&s;e neglected and forgotten.</P>
<P>There is in the human mind a faculty, called Com|mon-&s;en&s;e, which, though never in high e&s;timation a|mong Philo&s;ophers, &s;eems to have originated, and exe|cuted,
<PB N="24" REF="028610_0024_0FD9C5F1DE499DC8">
almo&s;t all the plans of human bu&s;ine&s;s which have proved to be of any u&s;e. The rea&s;on is obvious. Em|ployed in forming near and evident deductions from facts, and in clo&s;ely ob&s;erving facts for that purpo&s;e, contented with moderate advances, and cautious of innovation, its &s;tep, though &s;low, has been &s;ure; a real approximation to the end in view. Theory, or the contrary, rapid, but wild, has u&s;ually receded more than it has advanced. Untried cau&s;es, cau&s;es to which a new application is giv|en, and experiments in bu&s;ine&s;s, made either a new, or in new circum&s;tances, have always been regarded by Com|mon-&s;en&s;e with a &s;u&s;picious eye; and a &s;tate of things&punc; not perfectly de&s;irable, willingly endured, in preference to the adoption of new &s;y&s;tems, of which the effects were uncertain, and the operations dangerous.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of government, formed for South-Carolina, by Mr. Locke, may &s;tand as a portrait of all political theories. Fair and rational on paper, but deformed and u&s;ele&s;s in practice, it &s;uited the real circum&s;tances of that Colony, ju&s;t as a map, drawn by the fancy of a Geograph|er, would &s;uit an undi&s;covered country; or a chart of &s;oundings, marked by the Navigator, in &s;port, would &s;uit the real &s;tate of an untraver&s;ed ocean. If this Giant in under&s;tanding failed &s;o entirely in an attempt to form a theoretical &s;y&s;tem of government, reducible to practice, of what character mu&s;t be the attempts of modern pyg|mies?</P>
<P>That the knowledge, communicated by Experience and Revelation, was intended in this prophecy, will be evident to all per&s;ons, who remember, that this was the only knowledge in exi&s;tence, when the prophecy was written. Vi&s;ionary Philo&s;ophy had not then begun to mi&s;lead mankind. The world was contented with real knowledge; and, although its &s;tock was &s;mall, it was genuine and unalloyed, and therefore of a currency and u&s;e, &s;uited to human purpo&s;es. Had its progre&s;s been un|interrupted
<PB N="25" REF="028610_0025_0FD9C629C9F4F728">
by war and devastation, and unbewildered by theoretical Philo&s;ophy, we &s;hould now probably be re|moved, in real knowledge, many degrees beyond our pre&s;ent advances.</P>
<P>A general diffu&s;ion of knowledge, was undoubtedly de&s;igned in this prediction. In no other &s;en&s;e could knowledge be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the means of general &s;ta|bility.</P>
<P>The effects of knowledge, thus defined, are evidently of high importance to &s;ocial happine&s;s. The Legi&s;lator it will enable to under&s;tand the &s;tate, the intere&s;ts, and the duties, of a people; to form regulations &s;uited to their &s;tate, promotive of their intere&s;ts, and coinciding with their duty; to di&s;cern, with a freedom from low and per|nicious prejudices, that equitable government is the true &s;ource of honour to him&s;elf, and of pro&s;perity to his peo|ple; to ca&s;t his eyes abroad, without the purblind con|fu&s;ion of narrow minds, and &s;ee clearly the real condition of other nations, and their proper connection with the affairs of his own; to look back with di&s;tinctne&s;s, and with comprehen&s;ion, on the pa&s;t &s;tate of human &s;ociety, and forward, with rational prediction, to events which are ri&s;ing on the &s;urface of futurity. In a word, placed by &s;uch knowledge on a lofty &s;ummit, he &s;tands as a Watchman for the welfare of millions, unob&s;tructed by mi&s;ts, and undazzled by the height to which he is eleva|ted, with a &s;teady eye marks di&s;tinctly the &s;urrounding progre&s;s of things, and is enabled with confidence, and with &s;afety, to utter alike the quieting voice of peace, and the timely alarm of danger.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner is the Judge enabled to under|&s;tand and interpret law, to form equitable deci&s;ions, to exerci&s;e his di&s;cretionary authority in extending or re|&s;tricting penalties, and generally to hold with an equal hand the balance of right, between neighbour and neigh|bour, and between &s;ubjects and the &s;tate.</P>

<P>Nor are the people at large le&s;s intere&s;ted in the know|ledge above de&s;cribed. Stability of public happine&s;s, e&s;pecially in free States, depends wholly on the character of the citizens in general.

Equally u&s;eful is knowledge in teaching them the duties of Parents, children, friends, and neighbours, the nature and im|portance of a happy dome&s;tic education, the advantages of mild and obliging conduct, the univer&s;al profit of vir|tue, and the mi&s;chiefs of vice of every kind, in every de|gree, and towards every per&s;on.

In a word, from knowledge mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, be derived that &s;teadine&s;s of character, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of comforts, and that rational e&s;timation of things, which form the u&s;eful citizen, and the re&s;pectable Society.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="028610_0027_0FD9C62D608CCB50">From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I flatter my&s;elf, it will ap|pear, that the &s;tability of public happine&s;s is produced by Knowledge and Virtue; and that the diffusion of the&s;e through a Community is the true and the only method of &s;olving that political problem, which has &s;o long per|plexed the rulers of mankind. By the&s;e great attributes men are made good members of &s;ociety; and, compo&s;ed of &s;uch members, a Society mu&s;t be happy. They form, they fini&s;h, the magi&s;trate and the citizen alike. They teach every duty, and prompt to every performance. They originate wi&s;e and equitable laws, ju&s;t deci&s;ions and u&s;eful administrations. They create the amiable conju|gal and hou&s;hold offices, produce effectual dome&s;tic edu|cation, train to early and happy habits, and conduct to family peace, neighbourly kindne&s;s, a cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to law, a &s;teady love of rational government, and an uni|ver&s;al growth of &s;ocial enjoyment. Sweet and &s;alubrious &s;treams, they nouri&s;h happine&s;s wherever they pa&s;s; and, enlarging and mingling in their progre&s;s, &s;pread, in the end, an ocean of ble&s;&s;ings over the millions, who inhabit an empire.</P>
<P>It will not be improper to add, that the mo&s;t re&s;pect|able political writers have, with one voice, declared Vir|tue to be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of a free Government. As this &s;entiment has been adopted in oppo&s;ition to many prejudices, and intere&s;ts, religious and &s;ecular, and adopted by them all, it may be fairly &s;uppo&s;ed to be the re&s;ult of conviction and evidence. Perhaps it may have ari&s;en, in part, from the following view of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Government is rendered effectual by two great engines &mdash;force and per&s;ua&s;ion. Force is the in&s;trument of de|&s;poti&s;m, and per&s;ua&s;ion of free and rational government. To produce per&s;ua&s;ion, it is always nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;pire confidence. To in&s;pire confidence in &s;ubjects towards rulers, it is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ubjects to be &s;atisfied, that their
<PB N="28" REF="028610_0028_0FD9C5F9110C6910">
rulers are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of knowledge to di&s;cern, and of vir|tue to aim at, the general good. To in&s;pire confidence in rulers towards &s;ubjects, it is nece&s;&s;ary for rulers to be &s;atisfied, that their &s;ubjects po&s;&s;e&s;s knowledge to di&s;cern, and virtue to approve, the real wi&s;dom and equi|ty of public mea&s;ures. With the&s;e prerequi&s;ites, rulers will with confidence pur&s;ue the public intere&s;t; and &s;ub|jects will with equal confidence &s;upport their admini&s;tra|tion: without them, the ruler, fearful and &s;u&s;picious, al|ways in perplexity and always in danger, will feel him|&s;elf obliged to have recour&s;e to art, cabal, and contri|vance, to keep in motion the wheels of government&punc; and &s;ubjects anxious, jealous, and impatient, will con|tinually fluctuate between hope and fear, flock at every call to the &s;tandard of faction, and prove the prey of e|very demagogue.</P>
<P>Facts, al&s;o, lend their evidence to &s;upport this doctrine. Sparta and Rome were the mo&s;t &s;table of all the ancient republics. Virtue, in the &s;en&s;e of the Go&s;pel, they had not; but, in their early periods, they were, to an unu&s;ual degree, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what is called heathen virtue. Be|yond mo&s;t, perhaps beyond all, the heathen nations, they feared their gods, reverenced an oath, and believed in a providence, which rewarded the good, and puni&s;hed the evil. Their ideas of truth and ju&s;tice, however crude, were fixed; and they admitted fewer corruptions and vi|olations of the principles, which they e&s;teemed &s;acred, than mo&s;t other nations. While this was their conduct, their public happine&s;s, though imperfect, was &s;table; and, with the fall of the&s;e principles, it tumbled to the ground.</P>
<P>Among the modern nations of Europe, Switzerland, e&s;pecially in &s;ome of its Cantons, holds the highe&s;t rank in public happine&s;s. For more than 400 years, this di&s;|tingui&s;hed country has with&s;tood every &s;hock from within, and from without, and appears &s;till to re&s;t on firm found|ations.

Equally remarkable has this country been for knowledge and virtue. In no State, in Europe, have the inhabitants at large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed equal information, or ex|hibited equal proofs of piety and unblemi&s;hed morals. To the&s;e cau&s;es their happine&s;s is directly traced by every enlightened traveller. Happy Switzerland! God has created for thee thy walls and thy bulwarks. Under his good providence, thy bravery has made thee free, and thy knowledge and virtue have made thee happy.</P>
<P>On this &s;ide of the Atlantic, Connecticut, by an ex|ten&s;ive and increa&s;ing acknowledgement, appears to hold, in this re&s;pect, the fir&s;t &s;tation. The happine&s;s of this State, for one hundred and fifty years, has &s;uffered, ex|cept from external enemies, little diminution. Its go|vernment, cu&s;toms, manners, and general &s;tate of Socie|ty, have &s;carcely been changed, but by the gradual pro|gre&s;s of refinement. Formed, at fir&s;t, in all the great outlines, and nearly filled up, by men, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h|ed rectitude of di&s;po&s;ition, led, of cour&s;e, to ju&s;tne&s;s of opinion, and who&s;e &s;ound Common-&s;en&s;e, improved by clo&s;e ob&s;ervation, did not lead to error, its Con&s;titution, although, in many re&s;pects, a violation of political theo|ry, has been found more than any other to be fitted for practice. Public and private happine&s;s its inhabitants have, in a high, perhaps an unrivalled, degree, enjoyed. In no country has Virtue, for &s;o long a period, been held in higher e&s;timation, received more marks of public re|gard, or more emphatically formed the general character. Knowledge, at the &s;ame time has, in an almo&s;t &s;ingular manner, been diffu&s;ed through the ma&s;s of people. Eve|ry parent in the State has a &s;chool placed in his neigh|bourhood; and every child is furni&s;hed with the means of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction. To aid, and to com|plete, the&s;e peculiar advantages, a church in every di&s;|trict of a moderate &s;ize, opens its doors; to the &s;urround|ing inhabitants, and invites every family to receive the knowledge, communicated by the Word of God.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="028610_0030_0FD9C5F913678B68">The &s;ame doctrine might be even more &s;trongly illu&s;trated, if the time would permit, from the deplo|rable contra&s;t to the picture already drawn, pre&s;ented by the de&s;olations and mi&s;eries of vice and igno|rance. Almo&s;t all the hi&s;tory of mankind is an exhibi|tion of this nature; for vice and ignorance have in mo&s;t in&s;tances prevailed without a mixture, and reigned with|out controul. Rulers have trampled on the necks, riot|ed on the &s;poils, and &s;ported with the mi&s;eries, of their &s;ubjects. Subjects have fallen before them with impious homage, and &s;lavi&s;h bruti&s;m, or re&s;cued them&s;elves from oppre&s;&s;ion, to run mad with the phrenzy of anarchy, and to wanton in plunder and blood. Nations, as if in love with mi&s;ery, and un&s;atisfied to &s;ee their &s;ufferings &s;o &s;mall, have reached out an eager hand to gra&s;p at woe. War has been the profe&s;&s;ion of man, and arms his in&s;tru|ments of bu&s;ine&s;s, and of plea&s;ure. Conque&s;t, like a roaring lion, has &s;talked round the de&s;olated globe, &s;eek|ing whom he might devour. In his train, Ambition has &s;moked with &s;laughter; Avarice has ground the poor into du&s;t; and Pollution, like the me&s;&s;enger of death to the army of Sennacherib, has changed the ho&s;t of man into putrified corp&s;es. Fiends have looked on, and tri|umphed; Angels have wondered, and wept; and Hea|ven, as if di&s;couraged from efforts, has given up its work to wa&s;te and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The end of the ob&s;ervations, which I have made, is to impre&s;s on the minds of this audience the importance of public and individual exertions to promote knowledge and virtue in this State. If the ob&s;ervations are ju&s;t, the value of the object will not be di&s;puted. But it is one thing to be convinced of the importance of an object, and another to feel it in &s;uch a manner, as to be rou&s;ed into exertion in its behalf. Ignorance of the mo&s;t proper methods of exertion, difficulties always pre&s;enting them|&s;elves in its progre&s;s, and doubts concerning its &s;ucce&s;s, added to native indolence, ea&s;ily damp the ri&s;ing effort,
<PB N="31" REF="028610_0031_0FD9C6365EBBEB80">
and incline us to &s;hift the burden from our&s;elves to others, and to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the general opiate of con&s;cience, that our attempts will be vain, and may, therefore, be &s;afely neglected.</P>
<P>To &s;trengthen this enervating conclu&s;ion in our minds, we naturally &s;ummon to our aid the general voice of hu|man experience. "The cour&s;e of human affairs," we ea&s;ily &s;ay, and &s;ay with &s;ome degree of truth, "has been a con&s;tant exhibition of extreme difficulty, ever found in extending and e&s;tabli&s;hing virtue in the pre&s;ent world. The volume of man is written only in black; and page after page, when carefully turned over, is &s;een to be marked only with lines of vice, ignorance, and &s;orrow. Centuries have rolled on, without a beam of light; and Continents, throughout their expanded regions, have reeked with the &s;laughter of man, and echoed to the voice of mourning and mi&s;ery. Intervals have indeed appeared of a brighter a&s;pect; and favoured tracts have, at times, enjoyed the twilight promi&s;e of approaching day. But how few have been the&s;e envied exceptions to the general character of time, and to the general &s;tate of the world! What miniatures of happine&s;s, knowledge, and virtue mu&s;t we oppo&s;e to the gigantic figures of war, and woe, of idolatry and bruti&s;m! A few years form the only contra&s;t to &s;ixty centuries; and Switzerland is that &s;mall du&s;t of the balance, which mu&s;t be weighed again&s;t Af|rica and A&s;ia."</P>
<P>Such is the language of &s;loth and di&s;couragement. In the main it is true; but it is not the whole truth. The few experiments, which have been imperfectly made, to diffu&s;e knowledge, and implant and cultivate virtue, in the ma&s;s of mankind, have &s;ufficiently proved, that ef|forts for this end may be &s;ucce&s;sful; and that, when man has prepared the ground, and &s;own the &s;eed, Heaven will refu&s;e neither the rain, nor the &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="028610_0032_0FD9C5FE9B40D650">The whole cultivation of virtue is a conflict with vice; but the warfare is honourable, and the victory fruitful in advantage, beyond the reach of computation. Nothing valuable comes to man, without his cooperation; and the toil is commonly proportioned to the worth of the acqui&s;ition. As the diffu&s;ion of Virtue over a Commu|nity is the fir&s;t &s;ocial ble&s;&s;ing, &s;o it ought, according to the analogy of Providence, to be expected to demand greater efforts, than any other ble&s;&s;ing. Liberty has of|ten been the price of lives &s;carcely numerable, and of property exceeding calculation. Yet Liberty is a po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of le&s;s importance than Virtue. Had half the efforts been made to promote virtue, which have been made to extend war and &s;laughter, virtue would now, probably, con&s;titute the prevailing human character. But Virtue, though the fir&s;t good of man, has lea&s;t en|gaged his attention.</P>
<P>Wherever exertions have been made for the exten&s;ion of virtue, &s;ucce&s;s has followed. Under the &s;uperintend|ence, and by the labours, of the Apo&s;tles, its progre&s;s was a greater miracle to the eye, than all tho&s;e, which they performed&punc; as means of its exi&s;tence. With the gradual decay of effort it gradually cea&s;ed. At the Re|formation, exertion ro&s;e to a character almo&s;t Apo&s;tolic, and &s;ucce&s;s attended it, like that of the Apo&s;tles. In Switzerland, Holland, Scotland, England, and in &s;ome parts of the American States, the growth and preva|lence of Virtue has, at times, and through a con&s;idera|ble period, been fully proportioned to the efforts in its behalf, and an&s;wered every rational hope. There is, therefore, from experience, no rea&s;on for di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be &s;aid, that Virtue is the gift of God. This is no objection to the &s;entiments, here advanced. It is their &s;upport. Every ble&s;&s;ing is the gift of God. The harve&s;t is as truly his gift, as Virtue. Nor is there a rea&s;on to believe, that he will le&s;s willingly meet, with
<PB N="33" REF="028610_0033_0FD9C63749963170">
his ble&s;&s;ing, him, who labours to adorn the mind with moral beauty, and to plant in it the &s;eeds of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, than him, who, with equal indu&s;try, is employed in dre&s;&s;ing the earth in verdure, and in filling the field with bread.</P>
<P>That knowledge may be effectually diffu&s;ed through a Community will not be doubted.</P>
<P>On the methods, by which the&s;e great attributes of the mind, the&s;e great means of Social happine&s;s, maybe mo&s;t effectually cultivated, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, I have much to &s;ay; and feel it to be a misfortune, that &s;o large a part of my time &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to prepare a founda|tion, when the whole was nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e the &s;tructure. To the time, however, I mu&s;t conform, and important as I deem the &s;ubject, mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s it with mere hints, and heads of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Laws of every country have all, or may have, an important influence on this &s;ubject. The formation and e&s;tabli&s;hment of knowledge and virtue in the citizens of a Community is the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of Legi&s;lation, and will more ea&s;ily and more effectually e&s;tabli&s;h order, and &s;e|cure liberty, than all the checks, balances, and penalties, which have been devi&s;ed by man. With the Legi&s;lature this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould begin; and with reference to it mo&s;t, if not all, their important mea&s;ures ought to be concerted. They wi&s;h, doubtle&s;s, to do good to their country. In this way they can do more good to it, than in any other. Were this &s;entiment, in full &s;trength, in the mind of eve|ry Legi&s;lator, the object could not fail of being accom|pli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the exact execution of Law, tho&s;e magi&s;trates, to whom this duty is entru&s;ted, may find an exten&s;ive field for the employment of this mo&s;t honourable patrioti&s;m. It is not an uncommon, nor unfounded opinion, that the duties of executive officers are, here, le&s;s punctually per|formed, than the public good demands; and that too
<PB N="34" REF="028610_0034_0FD9C5FFC6521290">
&s;trong a &s;pirit of accommodation is become their cu&s;tom|ary character. Little crimes appear, unhappily, to be pa&s;&s;ed over with inattention, and thus prepare the way for tho&s;e which are greater. It is de&s;irable, that no Laws, be&s;ide nece&s;&s;ary ones, &s;hould exi&s;t; but is equally and even more de&s;irable, that every exi&s;ting Law &s;hould be execut|ed. In an effectual Grand-Jury this State is unhappily and &s;ingularly defective, and &s;uffers daily from the defect. Until this evil &s;hall be remedied, one wide door to im|morality and unhappine&s;s will be unnece&s;&s;arily left open.</P>
<P>Calumny again&s;t the &s;everal Officers, employed in go|vernmental duty, is one of the mo&s;t obvious methods of weakening government. The e&s;teem of the Community is, in all countries, an object of no &s;mall importance to per&s;ons in public agency; but, in this country, it is of the highe&s;t importance. The magi&s;trate, here, is rai&s;ed above others by his office only; and the e&s;teem, which he wi&s;hes to obtain, is the e&s;teem of his peers and com|panions. To deprive him of this e&s;teem is to deprive him, in a &s;en&s;e, of his all; and to do it wantonly and ma|liciou&s;ly is to act the part of an enemy, and a &s;avage. "Thou &s;halt not &s;peak evil of the ruler of thy people" is equally a law of Revelation, and of Common &s;en&s;e. If Rulers tran&s;gre&s;s, and act with fraud, or inju&s;tice, the path of regular impeachment is open, and ought to be pur&s;ued. Mere political &s;lander is the re&s;ult of ambiti|on, or of malice; and is as mi&s;chievous in its effects, as ba&s;e in its origin. The length, to which it has already proceeded, is great; the length, to which it will proceed, cannot be calculated. A &s;mall degree of fore&s;ight, will, however, enable us to decide, that, &s;hould it not be check|ed, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of office will, of it&s;elf, be e&s;teemed, ere long, an adequate proof of di&s;hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>But as Public happine&s;s depends, in this country, at lea&s;t, on the per&s;onal character of its inhabitants at large, &s;o the promotion of public happine&s;s mu&s;t, in a great
<PB N="35" REF="028610_0035_0FD9C63D0D199788">
mea&s;ure, re&s;t on per&s;onal exertions. Men of every de|&s;cription, who wi&s;h the end accompli&s;hed, mu&s;t unite to furni&s;h the means.</P>
<P>The primary mean of this end has, I flatter my&s;elf, been proved to be Virtue. States may be rich, powerful, and free; and yet not be happy. Antiquity furni&s;hes us with a long and pompous li&s;t of rich and powerful States; but &s;carcely with one, in which the great body of citizens in this State would not, if fairly informed in the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e States, be wholly unwilling to live; life, in our view, being hardly worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, if it mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed in &s;o wretched a &s;tate of Society. The &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion, with nearly the &s;ame force, may be applied to almo&s;t all the pre&s;ent States of Europe. The Gri&s;ons, allies of the Switzers, are, by their Con&s;titution of government, the free&s;t people, perhaps, of any on the Ea&s;tern Con|tinent. Still they are an unhappy people. They have neither virtue to de&s;ire, nor knowledge to under&s;tand, the common intere&s;t. Ju&s;tice, &s;uffrages, and the whole pub|lic weal, are, among them, &s;old annually, like goods in the market. Hence, with the fulle&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty, they are equally contemptible and wretched.</P>
<P>There are two great means of promoting virtue; Re|ligious Education and Public Wor&s;hip. Religious edu|cation prepares the mind to love, to attend, and to profit by public wor&s;hip; and public wor&s;hip &s;upports and regulates religious education. Without public wor&s;hip, children would cea&s;e to be religiou&s;ly educated; and without religious education, public wor&s;hip would cea&s;e to be attended.</P>
<P>To render public wor&s;hip u&s;eful, it mu&s;t be frequent|ed; and, to make it frequented, it mu&s;t, &s;o far as con|&s;i&s;ts with its nature, be made plea&s;ing. For this purpo&s;e, the mini&s;ters of this wor&s;hip mu&s;t, &s;o far as the circum|&s;tances of men will allow, be per&s;ons of knowledge, vir|tue and dignity. To &s;ecure, in any country, a &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on
<PB N="36" REF="028610_0036_0FD9C602F5CD3950">
of &s;uch mini&s;ters, their &s;upport ought to be comfort|able; the &s;ource neither of &s;plendour and luxury on the one hand, nor of &s;uffering and meanne&s;s on the other. Opulent livings would invite, and would be filled by tho&s;e, who mo&s;t covet opulence; the a&s;piring, and the unprincipled. A bare living would be le&s;t to &s;loth, and ignorance. A rich and proud mini&s;try would be inac|ce&s;&s;ible to the poor, and the humble; a mini&s;try &s;trug|gling under penury would tremble at the frowns of the rich, and the great. The &s;upport of mini&s;ters ought al&s;o to be &s;ecure, and endangered by nothing, but their mi&s;|conduct. Precarious livings, be&s;ide their expo&s;ure to all the evils of &s;canty ones, would furni&s;h, to the incumbents, daily temptations to &s;acrifice con&s;cience and duty to the whims, and the vices, of tho&s;e, from who&s;e goodwill they hoped to derive their daily bread. No Youth, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of learning, dignity, and worth, can be expected to ven|ture him&s;elf on the ocean of life, in a bark, which &s;o evi|dently announces a &s;peedy and certain &s;hipwreck, by its total want of &s;trength, and &s;afety, for the voyage.</P>
<P>Religion is always e&s;timated by the character of its mini&s;ters. If they are generally vile, the religion, which they profe&s;s, is generally abhorred; if contemptible, it is de&s;pi&s;ed; but, if worthy and dignified, it cannot but be re|&s;pected. Thus intimate and in&s;eparable is the permanent and &s;ufficient &s;upport of the mini&s;ters of religion with virtue, and of cour&s;e with the exi&s;tence, and the &s;tabili|ty, of public happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Religious education, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is dome&s;tic. To the early mind, parents are the mini&s;ters of religion appointed by God him&s;elf, and inve&s;ted by him with au|thority, and advantages, wholly peculiar. On that mind it is in their power to make impre&s;&s;ions, of the highe&s;t importance, and the mo&s;t benign efficacy; impre&s;&s;ions, which extend to all the great concerns of man, which mould the whole future character, and which &s;tand, thro'
<PB N="37" REF="028610_0037_0FD9C63E05782D50">
life, as prominent features in the conduct of every day. "Even a child may be known by his goings," &s;ays Solo|mon; or, as in the Hebrew, "By the goings of a Child may be known his future character, when a man." In the earlie&s;t &s;tages of childhood may be implanted &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, of truth and fal&s;hood, of hone&s;|ty and fraud, of good will and malice, of accountablene&s;s and judgment, of heaven and hell, of the glorious cha|racter of the Redeemer, of the pre&s;ence, in&s;pection, a|gency, and government, of God, as will remain, influ|ence, and govern, through every &s;ucceeding period; &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as will, in a great mea&s;ure, form for every &s;ocial duty, and preclude the nece&s;&s;ity of mo&s;t political re|&s;traints, and of all political violence. To communicate a religious education to their children is the greate&s;t ble&s;s|ing, which parents can u&s;ually confer upon them; the highe&s;t &s;ervice, which they can render to &s;ociety; and the mo&s;t important duty, which they can perform to God. Yet there is, perhaps, no duty more neglected.</P>
<P>To the efforts of parents tho&s;e of Schoolma&s;ters ought to be added. Where parents perform this duty, the Schoolma&s;ter may happily increa&s;e, and rivet, the im|pre&s;&s;ion: where they neglect it, he may, in no &s;mall mea&s;ure, &s;upply the defect. Moral in&s;truction of every kind ought invariably to form a material part of &s;chool education. To this end, it ought to be exacted of eve|ry Schoolma&s;ter, that he be, in the public eye, a virtu|ous man.</P>
<P>For this, and every other purpo&s;e, which is expected from &s;chools, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that the Legi&s;lature &s;hould &s;teadily interfere. Private efforts may do much; but they cannot do all. Where the &s;uffrages of all concern|ed are of equal influence, mea&s;ures are merely the effect of compromi&s;e, and incapable of &s;y&s;tem, or regularity. Hence the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;uperiour controul. Vi&s;itors, under Legi&s;lative authority, ought to be im|powered,

and obliged, to in&s;pect the knowledge, and the morals, of the teachers, the &s;y&s;tem of education, the dili|gence with which it is pur&s;ued, and the progre&s;s of the pupils in knowledge, manners, and morals. Regular re|turns ought to be made to Commi&s;&s;ioners of Government, concerning the whole &s;tate of education; and public be|nefits &s;hould invariably reward &s;uch per&s;ons, as originate e&s;&s;ential improvements.</P>
<P>Example, Union, Concert, are primary wheels in eve|ry &s;y&s;tem of improvement. All things flouri&s;h, where all hearts are engaged. The great object, here urged, has never been, but very imperfectly, made a national object&punc; It ought to be the fir&s;t end of all mea&s;ures national and per&s;onal. Power, wealth, and &s;plendour, cannot be more certainly acquired. It is as ea&s;y to ble&s;s, as to conquer; to enrich a land with virtue, and to adorn it with know|ledge, as to &s;tore it with &s;ilver, and load it with villas and palaces. Man may as ea&s;ily be a Saint, as a Savage; and Nations as ea&s;ily enlightened with Millennial glory, as overca&s;t with the midnight of Gothici&s;m. All that is nece&s;&s;ary, on the part of man, is to bring the &s;ubject home to his heart, to feel its ine&s;timable importance, to rea|lize its practicability, and to make it the chief aim of his fixed endeavours.</P>
<P>Confident of the ju&s;tice, and of the intere&s;ting nature, of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, let me a&s;k, Is there in the wide re|gion of human concerns, is there in the wider regions of the univer&s;e, an object, which ought more to engro&s;s the attention, and the labour, of man? Is there a more ho|nourable patrioti&s;m, or a truer friend&s;hip to liberty, than thus to aim, and thus to labour? Ought it not to &s;eize the heart, to in&s;pire the voice, and to command the hands, of every citizen? Who can &s;ay, and &s;ay with truth, "I have no concern in this employment"? Who can &s;ay, "My labours will be u&s;ele&s;s"? Who is &s;o poor, &s;o low|ly, &s;o ignorant, as not to be able to ca&s;t in to the public

&s;tock his two mites? Who among the richer, the more enlightened, the more dignified, can, to any other pur|po&s;e, &s;o nobly contribute, of his abundance?</P>
<P>Connecticut can never be di&s;tingui&s;hed for extent of territory, &s;uperiour wealth, or great numbers of inhabit|ants. This, in&s;tead of being a misfortune, ought to be e&s;teemed a ble&s;&s;ing. A nobler di&s;tinction is thrown by a good Providence into its hands. It may ri&s;e to pre|eminence in knowledge, virtue, and happine&s;s. We need not grudge the dro&s;s, while the gold is ours. It may be the Athens, not of a &s;avage, idolatrous, and brutal world, but of a world enlightened, refined, and chri&s;tian. Let its citizens unite in well concerted and determined efforts, for this end; and it will be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>How honourable, how enviable a ta&s;k, how glorious a crown of patriotic labours already undergone, would it be to the officers of an Army, di&s;tingui&s;hed by unpre|cedented and mo&s;t public-&s;pirited efforts, in the cau&s;e of their country, to &s;tand foremo&s;t in the pur&s;uit of this fir&s;t intere&s;t, this &s;upreme glory, of that country? With that courage with which they braved a foreign invader, that patience of &s;uffering with which they encountered toil, and want, and that per&s;everance with which they &s;urmounted difficulty and di&s;couragement, to meet eve|ry foe employed to attack, every art exerted to under|mine, and every ob&s;tacle rai&s;ed up to hinder, our public pro&s;perity? What a wreath of laurel will be twined a|round their memory, whenever it is rehear&s;ed, that they were, alike, the be&s;t &s;oldiers, and the be&s;t citizens? The path to this glory, I flatter my&s;elf, I have di&s;clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such efforts are vi&s;ibly demanded of all citizens to pre&s;erve, as well as to increa&s;e, the happine&s;s, for which that Army &s;o bravely fought, and &s;o largely bled. Our very Government, &s;o mild, &s;o u&s;eful, and &s;o harmoniou&s;|ly adopted, has been attacked by intrigue, calumny, and in&s;urrection. This evil has exi&s;ted, while the chair of
<PB N="40" REF="028610_0040_0FD9C60BCAC537A8">
Magi&s;tracy has been filled by a Man, who, under God, has probably wrought for this country more ble&s;&s;ings, than were ever wrought by any man for any country: who&s;e wi&s;dom has proved &s;uperiour to every perplexity, who&s;e patrioti&s;m to every temptation, and who&s;e forti|tude to every trial: a Man, who can pa&s;s through no American States, &s;urvey no field, and tread on no &s;pot of ground, which he has not &s;aved from deva&s;tation; who can mix with no a&s;&s;embly, vi&s;it no family, and ac|co&s;t no per&s;on, who mu&s;t not &s;ay, "Our freedom, our peace, our &s;afety, we owe fir&s;t to God, and next to you:" who can turn his ear to no &s;ound of joy, which he has not a &s;hare in exciting; and open his eye on no &s;cene of comfort, which does not trace him as its origin; a man to whom poets, orators, &s;ages, legi&s;lators, and the nations of two worlds, have eagerly paid their tribute of e&s;teem, admiration, and love. Again&s;t this very man have the&s;e evils been directed. What then mu&s;t be looked for, when the &s;ame &s;eat &s;hall be filled by inferiour talents, &s;u&s;tained by a patrioti&s;m le&s;s unequivocal, and &s;anctioned by a popularity le&s;s complete? What, but an event, at which philanthropy &s;hudders; and, with the exi&s;tence of which, the hopes of the wi&s;e, and the good, will be extingui&s;hed forever? To avert &s;uch a cata&s;tro|phe, and under the banner of &s;uch a leader, his illu&s;trious companions in the field will cheerfully unite, and call to the &s;tandard every virtuous citizen, every friend of man, to pre&s;erve all that, for which they fought, and to en|crea&s;e all that, in which they glory. Thus will they &s;ecure the peace of an approving con&s;cience, enjoy the tran&s;ports of an expanded benevolence, and commence a career of honour which will know no end.</P>
