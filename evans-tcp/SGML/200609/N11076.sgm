<L>If ever Heaven befriended the di&s;tre&s;t,</L>
<L>If ever valour &s;uccour'd tho&s;e oppre&s;t,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="014038_0012_0F92ABFFA3A63880">America rojoice, thy &s;tandard rear,</L>
<L>Let the loud trumpet animate to war:</L>
<L>Thy guardian Genius ha&s;te thee on thy way,</L>
<L>To &s;trike whole ho&s;ts with terror and di&s;may.</L>
<L>Happy &s;ome land, which all for freedom gave,</L>
<L>Happier the men whom their own virtues &s;ave;</L>
<L>Thrice happy we who long attacks have &s;tood,</L>
<L>And &s;wam to Liberty thro' &s;eas of blood;</L>
<L>The time &s;hall come when &s;trangers rule no more,</L>
<L>Nor cruel mandates vex from Britain's &s;hore;</L>
<L>When Commerce &s;hall extend her &s;hort'ned wing,</L>
<L>And her free freights from every climate bring.</L>
<L>When mighty towns &s;hall flouri&s;h free and great,</L>
<L>Va&s;t their dominion, opulent their &s;tate;</L>
<L>When one va&s;t cultivated region teems,</L>
<L>From ocean's edge to Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;treams;</L>
<L>While each enjoys his vineyard's peaceful &s;hade,</L>
<L>And even the meane&s;t has no cau&s;e to dread;</L>
<L>Such is the life our foes with envy &s;ee,</L>
<L>Such is the godlike glory to be free.</L>
