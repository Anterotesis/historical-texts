<HEAD>THE NARRATIVE OF DR. KNIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the latter end of the month of March, or the beginning of April of the year 1782, the we&s;tern Indians began to make incur&s;ions upon the frontiers of Ohio, Wa&s;hing|ton, Youghagany, and We&s;tmoreland counties, which has been their con&s;tant practice ever &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent war between the United States and Great Britain.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e predatory inva&s;ions, the principal officers of the abovementioned counties, namely, Colonels William&s;on and Mar&s;hall, tried every method in their power to &s;et on foot an expedition again&s;t the Wyandot towns, which they could effect no other way than by giving all po&s;&s;ible encouragement to volunteers. The plan propo&s;ed was as follows: Every man furni&s;hing him&s;elf with a hor&s;e, a gun, and one months provi&s;ions, &s;hould be ex|empted from two tours of militia duty. Like|wi&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="035689_0003_1005F0AE99C5A030">
that everyone who had been plundered by the Indians, &s;hould if the plunder could be found at their towns, have it again, proving it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> his property: And all hor&s;es lo&s;t on the expedition by unavoidable accident were to be replaced by hor&s;es taken in the enemy's country.</P>
<P>The time appointed for the rendezvous, or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> meeting of the volunteers, was fixed to be on the 20th of May, and the place, the old <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> town on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river Ohio, about forty miles below Fort Pitt by land, and I think about 75 by water.</P>
<P>Col. Crawford was &s;olicited by the Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> voice of the&s;e we&s;tern counties and di&s;tricts to command the expedition. He accordingly &s;et out as volunteer and came to Fort Pitt two days before the time appointed for the a&s;&s;embling of the men. As there was no &s;urgeon yet appoint|ed to go with the expedition, Colonel Crawford begged the favour of Gen. Irvine to permit me to accompany him, (my con&s;ent having been previou&s;ly asked) to which the General agreed provided Col. Gib&s;on did not object.</P>
<P>Having obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the Colonel. I left Port Pitt on Tue&s;day, May 1&s;t, and the next day about one in the afternoon arrived at the Mingoe bottom. The volunteers had not all cro&s;&s;ed the river until Friday morning the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they then di&s;tributed them&s;elves into eigh|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> companies, choo&s;ing their captains by vote. There were cho&s;en al&s;o, one Col. Commandant, four field and one brigade-major. There were four hundred and &s;ixty five who voted.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035689_0004_1005F0B026D9B1A8">We began our march on Saturday May 25th, making almo&s;t a due we&s;t cour&s;e, and on the 4th day reached the old Moravian town <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the river Muskingum, about 60 miles from the river Ohio. Some of the men having lo&s;t their hor&s;es on the night preceding returned home.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day the 28th in the evening, Major B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ton, and Captain Bean, went &s;ome di&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> camp to reconnoitre: Having gone about one quarter of a mile they &s;aw two Indians, upon whom they fired, and then returned to camp. This was the fir&s;t place in which we were di&s;|covered, as we under&s;tood afterwards.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 4th of June, which was the eleventh day of our march, about one o'clock, we came to the &s;pot where the town of Sandusky formerly &s;tood; the inhabitants had moved 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> miles lower down the creek, near the lower Sandusky: But as neither our guides or any who were with us, had known any thing of their removal, we began to conjecture there were no Indian towns nearer than the lower Sandusky, which was at lea&s;t 40 miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>However, after refre&s;hing our hor&s;es, we ad|vanced on in &s;earch of &s;ome of their &s;ettlements but had &s;carcely got the di&s;tance of three or four miles from the old town when a number of our men expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire to return, &s;ome of them alledging that they had only five days provi&s;ions upon which the field officers and captains, determined, in council, to proceed that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and no longer. Previous to the calling of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> council, a &s;mall party of light hor&s;e had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ent forward to reconnoitre.
<PB N="6" REF="035689_0005_1005F0B2BA994050">
I &s;hall here remark, by the way, that there are a great many exten&s;ive plains in that country: The woods in general grow very thin, free from bru&s;h and underwood; &s;o that light hor&s;emen may advance a con&s;iderable di&s;tance before an army without being much expo&s;ed to the enemy.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the council ended, an expre&s;s returned from the above mentioned party of light hor&s;e with intelligence, "that they had been about three miles in front, and had &s;een a large body of Indians running towards them."&mdash;In a &s;hort time we &s;aw the re&s;t of the light hor&s;e, who joined us, and having gone one mile further met a number of Indians who had partly got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of a piece of woods before us; whil&s;t we were in the plains but our men alighting from their hor&s;es and ru&s;hing into the woods, &s;oon obliged them to abandon that place.</P>
<P>The enemy being by this time reinforced, flanked to the right, and part of them coming in our rear, quickly made the action more &s;erious. The firing continued very warm on both &s;ides from four o'clock until the dusk of the evening, each party maintaining their ground. Next morning about &s;ix oclock &s;ome guns were di&s;|charged at the di&s;tance of two or three hundred yards, which continued till day, doing little or no execution on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The field officers then a&s;&s;embled and agreed, as the enemy were every moment increa&s;ing, and we had already a number wounded, to retreat that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ight. The whole body was to form into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, keeping the wounded in the centre.
<PB REF="035689_0006_100627DA4E83C648">
We had four killed and twenty three wounded, of the latter, &s;even very dangerou&s;ly, on which account as many biers were got ready to carry them: Mo&s;t of the re&s;t were &s;lightly wounded and none &s;o bad but they could ride on hor&s;e|back. After dark the officers went on the out po&s;ts and brought in all the men as expeditiou&s;ly as they could. Ju&s;t as the troops were about to form, &s;everal guns were fired by the enemy, upon which &s;ome of our men &s;poke out and &s;aid, our intention was di&s;covered by the Indians who were firing alarm guns. Upon which &s;ome in front hurried off, and the re&s;t immediately fol|lowed, leaving the &s;even men that were danger|ou&s;ly wounded, &s;ome of whom however got off on hor&s;eback, by means of &s;ome good friends, who waited for, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them.</P>
<P>We had not got a quarter of a mile from the field of action, when I heard Col. Crawford calling for his &s;on John Crawford, his &s;on-in-law Maj. Harri&s;on, Maj. Ro&s;e and William Craw|ford, his nephews, upon which I came up and told him I believed they were before us&mdash;He asked, was that the Doctor? I told him it was he then replied, they were not in front, and begged of me not to leave him&mdash;I promi&s;ed him I would not.</P>
<P>We then waited, and continued calling for the&s;e men till the troops had pa&s;&s;ed us. The Colonel told me his hor&s;e had almo&s;t given out, that he could not keep up with the troops, and wi&s;hed &s;ome of his be&s;t friends to remain with him; he then exclaimed again&s;t the militia for
<PB N="8" REF="035689_0007_100627DCCBADB730">
riding off in &s;uch an irregular manner, and leaving &s;ome of the wounded behind, contrary to his orders. Pre&s;ently there came two men riding after us, one of them an old man, the other a lad: We enquired if they had &s;een any of the above per&s;ons? And they an&s;wered they had not.</P>
<P>By this time there was a very hot firing before us, and, as we judged, near where our main body mu&s;t have been. Our cour&s;e was then nearly &s;outh-we&s;t, but changing it, we went north about two miles, the two men remaining in company with us. Judging our&s;elves, to be now out of the enemy's lines, we took a due ea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, taking care to keep at the di&s;tance of fifteen or twenty yards apart, and directing our&s;elves by the north &s;tar.</P>
<P>The old man often lagged behind, and when this was the ca&s;e never failed to call for us to halt for him. When we were near the Sandusky Creek he fell one hundred yards behind, and bawled out, as u&s;ual, for us to hault. While we were preparing to reprimand him for making a noi&s;e, I heard an Indian halloo, as I thought one hundred and fifty yards from the man, and partly behind him; and after this we did not hear the man call again, neither did he ever come up to us any more. It was now pa&s;t midnight, and about day break Col. Crawford's and the young man's hor&s;es gave out, and they left them. We pur&s;ued our journey ea&s;tward, and about two o'clock fell in with Capt. Biggs, who had carried Lieut. A&s;hly from the field of action,
<PB N="9" REF="035689_0008_100627E06E2F6510">
who had been dangerou&s;ly wounded. We then went on about the &s;pace of an hour, when a heavy rain coming on, we concluded it was be&s;t to encamp, as we were encumbered with the wounded officer. We then barked four or five trees, made an encampment and a fire, and remained there all that night. Next morning we again pro&s;ecuted our journey, and having gone about three miles found a deer which had been recently killed. The meat was &s;liced from the bones and bundled up in the skin with a tomahawk lying by it. We carried all with us, and in advancing about one mile further e&s;pyed the &s;moke of a fire. We then gave the wound|ed officer into the charge of the young man, de&s;iring him to &s;tay behind whil&s;t the Colonel, the Captain, and my&s;elf, walked up as cautiou&s;ly as we could toward the fire. When we came to it, we concluded from &s;everal circum&s;tances &s;ome of our people had encamped there the preceding night, We then went about roa&s;ting the veni&s;on&punc; and when ju&s;t about to march ob|&s;erved one of our men coming upon our tracks. He &s;eemed at fir&s;t very &s;hy, but having called to him he came up and told us he was the per|&s;on who had killed the deer, but upon hearing us come up, was afraid of Indians, hid in a thicket and made off. Upon this we gave him &s;ome bread and roa&s;ted veni&s;on, proceeded al|together on our journey, and about two o'clock came upon the paths by which we had gone out. Capt. Biggs and my&s;elf did not think it &s;afe to keep the road, but the Colonel &s;aid the
<PB N="10" REF="035689_0009_1005F09B6537EC70">
Indians would nor follow the troops farther than the plains, which we were then con&s;ider|ably pa&s;t. As the wounded officer rode Capt. Biggs' hor&s;e, I lent the Captain mine; the Co|lonel and my&s;elf went about one hundred yards in front, the Captain and the wounded officer in the centre, and the two young men behind. After we had travelled about one mile and a half, &s;everal Indians &s;tarted up within fifteen or twenty &s;teps of the Colonel and me. As we at fir&s;t di&s;covered only three I immediately got behind a large black oak, made ready my piece and rai&s;ed it up to take &s;ight, when the Colonel called to me twice not to fire; upon that one of the Indians ran up to the Colonel and took him by the hand. The Colonel then told me to put down my gun, which I did. At that in&s;tant one of them came up to me whom I had formerly &s;een very often, calling me Doctor and took me by the hand. They were Dela|ware Indians of the Wingenim tribe. Captain Biggs fired among&s;t them but did no execution. They then told us, to call the&s;e people and make them come there, el&s;e they would go and kill them, which the Colonel did, but they four got off and e&s;caped for that time. The Col|onel and I were then taken to the Indian camp, which was about half a mile from the place, where we were captivated. On Sunday even|ing five Delawares who had po&s;ted them&s;elves at &s;ome di&s;tance further on the road brought back to the Camp, where we lay, Captain Biggs' and Lieutenant A&s;hley's &s;calps, with an Indian
<PB N="11" REF="035689_0010_100627E1F2CC0358">
&s;calp which Captain Biggs had taken in the field of action: They al&s;o brought in Biggs' hor&s;e and mine, they told us the two other men got a|way from them.</P>
<P>Monday morning, the tenth of June, we were paraded to march to Sandusky, about 33 miles di&s;tant: They had eleven pri&s;oners of us and four &s;calps, the Indians being &s;eventeen in number.</P>
<P>Col. Crawford was very de&s;irous to &s;ee a cer|tain Simeon Girty, who lived among the Indians, and was on this account permitted to go to town the &s;ame night, with two warriors to guard him, having orders at the &s;ame time to pa&s;s by the place where the Colonel had turned out his hor&s;e, that they might if po&s;&s;ible, find him.&mdash; The re&s;t of us were taken as far as the old town which was within eight miles of the new.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day morning, the 11th, Col. Crawford was brought out to us on purpo&s;e to be marched in with the other pri&s;oners. I asked the Colonel if he had &s;een Mr. Girty?&mdash;He told me he had, and that Girty had promi&s;ed to do every thing in his power for him, but that the Indians were very much enraged again&s;t the pri&s;oners; par|ticularly Capt. Pipe one of the Chiefs: He like|wi&s;e told me that Girty had informed him that his &s;on-in-law, Col. Harri&s;on and his nephew William Crawford, were made pri&s;oners by the Shawane&s;e, but had been pardoned. This Capt. Pipe had come from the towns about an hour before Col. Crawford, and had painted all the pri&s;oner's faces black.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035689_0011_100627E476D8B5E0">As he was painting me he told me I &s;hould go to the Shawane&s;e towns and &s;ee my friends. When the Colonel arrived he painted him black al&s;o, told him he was glad to &s;ee him and that he would have him &s;haved when he came to &s;ee his friends at the Wyandot town. When we marched, the Colonel and I were kept back be|tween Pipe and Wyngenim, the two Delaware chiefs, the other nine pri&s;oners were &s;ent for|ward with another party of Indians. As we went along we &s;aw four of the pri&s;oners lying by the path tomahawked and &s;calped, &s;ome of them were at the di&s;tance of half a mile from each other. When we arrived within half a mile of the place where the Colonel was exe|cuted, we overtook the five pri&s;oners that re|mained alive: The Indians had cau&s;ed them to &s;it down on the ground, as they did, al&s;o the Colonel and me at &s;ome di&s;tance from them, I was there given in charge to an Indian fel|low to be taken to the Shawane&s;e towns.</P>
<P>In the place where we were now made to &s;it down there was a number of &s;quaws and boys who fell on the five pri&s;oners and tomahawked them. There was a certain John M'Kinley among&s;t the pri&s;oners, formerly an officer in the 13th Virginia regiment, who&s;e head an old &s;quaw cut off, and the Indians kicked it about upon the ground. The young Indian fellows came often where the Colonel and I were, and da&s;hed the &s;calps in our faces. We were then conducted along toward the place where the Colonel was afterwards executed; When we
<PB N="13" REF="035689_0012_100627E5F9814488">
came within about half a mile of it, Simeon Girty met us, with &s;everal Indians on hor&s;eback; He &s;poke to the Colonel, but as I was about one hundred and fifty yards behind could not hear what pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every Indian we met &s;truck us either with &s;ticks or their fi&s;ts. Girty waited till I was brought up, and asked, was that the Doctor?&mdash; I told him, yes, and went toward him reaching out my hand, but he bid me begone, and called me a dam'd ra&s;cal; upon which the fellow who had me in charge pulled me along. Girty rode up after me and told me I was to go to the Shaw|ane&s;e towns.</P>
<P>When we were come to the fire the Colonel was &s;tripped naked, ordered to &s;it down by the fire, and then they beat him with &s;ticks and their fi&s;ts. Pre&s;ently after I was treated in the &s;ame manner. They then tied a rope to the foot of a po&s;t about fifteen feet high, bound the Colonel's hands behind his back and fa&s;tened the rope to the ligature between his wri&s;ts. The rope was long enough either for him to &s;it down or walk round the po&s;t once or twice and return the &s;ame way. The Colonel then called to Girty and asked if they intended to burn him? Girty an|&s;wered, yes. The Colonel &s;aid he would take it all patiently. Upon this Capt. Pipe, a Dela|ware Chief, made a &s;peech to the Indians, viz. about thirty or forty men, &s;ixty or &s;eventy &s;quaws and boys.</P>
<P>When the &s;peech was fini&s;hed they all yelled a hedious and hearty a&s;&s;ent to what had been
<PB N="14" REF="035689_0013_100627E79147EB70">
&s;aid. The Indian men then took up their guns and &s;hot powder into the Colonel's body, from his feet as far up as his neck. I think not le&s;s than &s;eventy loads were di&s;charged upon his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> body. They then crowded about him, and to the be&s;t of my ob&s;ervation, cut off his ears: When the throng had di&s;per&s;ed a little I &s;aw the blood running from both &s;ides of his head in con&s;equence thereof.</P>
<P>The fire was about &s;ix or &s;even yards from the po&s;t to which the Colonel was tied: It was made of &s;mall hickory poles, burnt quite through in the middle, each end of the poles remaining about &s;ix feet in length. Three or four Indi|ans by turns would take up, individually, one of the&s;e burning pieces of wood and apply it to his naked body, already burned black with the powder. The&s;e tormentors pre&s;ented them|&s;elves on every &s;ide of him, &s;o that which ever way he ran round the po&s;t they met him with the burning faggots and poles. Some of the &s;quaws took broad boards upon which they would put a quantity of burning coals and hot embers, and throw on him, &s;o that in a &s;hort time he had no|thing but coals of fire and hot a&s;hes to walk upon.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e extreme tortures he call|ed to Simeon Girty and begged of him to &s;hoot him: But Girty making no an&s;wer he called to him again. Girty then, by way of deri&s;ion, told the Colonel he had no gun, at the &s;ame time turn|ing about to an Indian who was behind him, laughed heartily, and by all his ge&s;tures &s;eemed delighted at the horrid &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035689_0014_100627EB07CF8300">Girty then came up to me and bade me pre|pare for death. He &s;aid, however I was not to die at that place, but to be burnt at the Shawne&s;e towns. He &s;wore by G&mdash;d I need not expect to e&s;cape death, but &s;hould &s;uffer it in all its ex|tremities.</P>
<P>He then ob&s;erved that &s;ome pri&s;oners had giv|en him to under&s;tand that if our people had him they would not hurt him; for his part, he &s;aid, he did not believe it, but de&s;ired to know my opini|on of the matter; but being at that time in great angui&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s for the torments the Colonel was &s;uffering before my eyes, as well as the ex|pectation of undergoing the &s;ame fate in two days. I made little or no an&s;wer. He expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of ill will for Col. Gib&s;on, and &s;aid he was one of his greate&s;t enemies, and more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to all which I paid very little at|tention.</P>
<P>Col. Crawford at this period of his &s;ufferings, be&s;ought the Almighty to have mercy on his &s;oul, &s;poke very low, and bore his torments with the mo&s;t manly fortitude. He continued in all the extremities of pain for an hour and three quarters or two hours longer, as near as I can judge, when at la&s;t being almo&s;t &s;pent, he lay down on his belly: They then &s;calped him and repeatedly threw the &s;calp in my face, telling me "that was my great Captain."&mdash;An old &s;quaw (who&s;e appearance everyway an&s;wered the ideas people entertain of the Devil) got a board, took a parcel of coals and a&s;hes and laid them on his back and head after he had been &s;calped: He
<PB N="16" REF="035689_0015_100627EFA2ED8740">
then rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his feet and began to walk round the po&s;t: They next put a burning &s;tick to him as u&s;ual, but he &s;eemed more in&s;en&s;i|ble of pain than before.</P>
<P>The Indian fellow who had me in charge now took me away to Capt. Pipe's hou&s;e, about three quarters of a mile from the place of the colonel's execution. I was bound all night and thus pre|vented from &s;eeing the la&s;t of the horrid &s;pecta|cle. Next morning, being June 12th, the Indian untied me, painted me black, and we &s;et off for the Shawane&s;e town, which he told me was &s;ome|what le&s;s than forty miles from that place. We &s;oon came to the &s;pot where the Colonel was burnt, as it was partly in our way; I &s;aw his bones laying among&s;t the remains of the fire, almo&s;t burnt to a&s;hes, I &s;uppo&s;e after he was dead they had laid his body on the fire.</P>
<P>The Indian told me, that was my Big Cap|tain and gave the &s;calp halloo. He was on hor&s;eback and drove me before him.</P>
<P>I pretended to this Indian I was ignorant of the death I was to die at the Shawane&s;e town, affect|ed as cheerful a countenance as po&s;&s;ible and ask|ed him if we were not to live together as broth|ers in one hou&s;e when we &s;hould get to the town? He &s;eemed well plea&s;ed, and &s;aid, yes. He then asked me if I could make a wigwam?&mdash;I told him I could&mdash;he then &s;eemed more friendly&mdash;we went that day as near as I can judge about 25 miles, the cour&s;e partly &s;outhwe&s;t&mdash;The Indian told me we &s;hould next day come to the town the &s;un being in &s;uch a direction, pointing nearly &s;outh. At

night when we went to re&s;t I attempted very of|ten to untie my&s;elf, but the Indian was extreme|ly vigilant and &s;carce ever &s;hut his eyes that night. About day break he got up and untied me: He next began to mend up the fire, and as the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> were trouble&s;ome I asked him if I &s;hould make a &s;moke behind him? He &s;aid, yes. I then took the end of a dogwood fork which had been burnt down to about 18 inches long: It was the longe&s;t &s;tick I could find, yet too &s;mall for the purpo&s;e I had in view: then I picked up another &s;maller &s;tick and taking a coal of fire between them went behind him: Then turning &s;uddenly about, I &s;truck him on the head with all the force I was ma&s;ter of; which &s;o &s;tunned him that he fell forwards with both his hands into the fire, but &s;eeing him recover and get up, I &s;eized his gun while he ran off howling in a mo&s;t fearful manner&mdash;I followed him with a determination to &s;hoot him down, but pulling back the cock of the gun with too great violence I believe I broke the main &s;pring. I pur&s;ued him, however, about thirty yards &s;till endeavouring to fire the gun, but could not; then going back to the fire I took his blanket, a pair of new mokki&s;ons, his hopp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s, powder horn, bullet bag, (together with the gun) and marched off, directing my cour&s;e tow|ard the five o'clock mark; about half an hour be|fore &s;un&s;et I came to the plains which I think are about &s;ixteen miles wide. I laid me down in a thicket till dark, and then by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the north &s;tar made my way through them and not into the woods before morning. I proceeded
<PB N="18" REF="035689_0017_100627F26C6D2F28">
on the next day and about noon cro&s;&s;ed the paths by which our troops had gone out: The&s;e paths are nearly ea&s;t and we&s;t but I went due north all that afternoon with a view to avoid the enemy.</P>
<P>In the evening I began to be very faint, and no wonder; I had been &s;ix days pri&s;oner; the la&s;t two days of which I had eat nothing, and out very little the fir&s;t three or four: There were wild goo&s;eberries in abundance in the woods, but being unripe required ma&s;tication, which at that time I was not able to perform on account of a blow received from an Indian on the jaw with the back of a tomahawk: There was a weed that grew plentifully in that place, the juice of which I knew to be grateful and nouri&s;hing; I gathered a bundle of the &s;ame, took up my lodging under a large &s;preading beach tree and having &s;ucked plentifully of the juice, went to &s;leep. Next day I made a due ea&s;t cour&s;e which I generally kept the re&s;t of my journey. I often imagined my gun was only wood bound and tried every method I could devi&s;e to un&s;crew the lock but never could effect it having no knife nor any thing fitting for the purpo&s;e; I had now the &s;atis|faction to find my jaw began to mend and in four or five days could chew any vegetable proper for nouri&s;hment, but finding my gun only a u&s;ele&s;s burden left her in the wilderne&s;s. I had no appa|ratus for making fire to &s;leep by &s;o that I could get but little re&s;t for the gnats and mu&s;quetoes; there are likewi&s;e a great many &s;wamps in the beach ridge which occa&s;ioned me very often to lie we<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">: This ridge through which I travelled is a|bout
<PB N="19" REF="035689_0018_1005F098F1AFC1D0">
20 miles broad, the ground in general very level and rich, free from &s;hrubs and bru&s;h: there are, however, very few &s;prings, yet wells might ea&s;ily be dug in all parts of that ridge; the tim|ber on it is very lofty, but it is no ea&s;y matter to make a &s;trait cour&s;e through the &s;ame, the mo&s;s growing as high upon the &s;outh &s;ide of the trees as on the north. There are a great many white oaks, a&s;h and hickory trees that grow among the beach timber; there are likewi&s;e &s;ome places on the ridge, perhaps for three or four continued miles where there is little or no beach, and in &s;uch &s;pots, black, white oah, a&s;h and hickory abound. Sugar trees grow there al&s;o to a very great bulk: The &s;oil is remarkably good, the ground a little a&s;cending and de&s;cending with &s;ome &s;mall rivu|lets and a few &s;prings. When I got out of the beach ridge and nearer the river Muskingum the lands were more broken but equally rich with tho&s;e before mentioned, and abounding with brooks and &s;prings of water: There are al&s;o &s;e|veral &s;mall creeks that empty into that river, the bed of which is more than a mile wide in many places: The woods con&s;i&s;t of white and black oaks, walnut, hickory and &s;ugar trees in the great|e&s;t abundance. In all parts of the country thro' which I came the game was very plenty, that is to &s;ay, deer, turkies and phea&s;ants, I likewi&s;e &s;aw a great many ve&s;tiges of bears and &s;ome elks.</P>
<P>I cro&s;&s;ed the river Muskingum about three or four miles below Fort Laurence, and cro&s;&s;ing all paths aimed for the Ohio river. All this time my food was goo&s;eberries, young nettles, the

juice of herbs, a few &s;ervice berries, and &s;ome May apples, likewi&s;e, two young blackbirds and a turripine which I devoured raw. When my food &s;at heavy on my &s;tomach, I u&s;ed to eat a lit|tle wild ginger which put all to rights.</P>
<P>I came upon Ohio river about five miles below fort M'Into&s;h, in the evening of the 21&s;t day after I had made my e&s;cape, and on the twenty &s;econd, about &s;even o'clock in the morning, being the fourth day of July, arrived &s;afe, though very much fatigued, at the fort.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT MEMOIR OF THE WITHIN MENTIONED COL. CRAWFORD.</HEAD>
<P>COL. CRAWFORD, was about 50 years of age, had been an old warrior again&s;t the &s;avages. He di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf early as a volunteer in the la&s;t war, and was taken notice of by Colonel (now General) Wa&s;hington, who pro|cured for him the Commi&s;&s;ion of En&s;ign. As a parti&s;an he &s;howed him&s;elf very active, and was greatly &s;ucce&s;sful: He took &s;everal Indian towns, and did great &s;ervice in &s;couting, patrolling and defending the frontiers. At the commence|ment of this war he rai&s;ed a regiment in the back country by his own exertions: He had the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of Colonel in the Continental army, and acted bravely on &s;everal occa&s;ions in the years '76, '77, and at other times. He held his Com|mi&s;&s;ion at the time he took Command of the mi|litia in the afore&s;aid expedition again&s;t the Indi|ans; mo&s;t probably he had it with him when he was taken: He was a man of good judgment, &s;ingular good nature, and great humanity, and remarkable for his ho&s;pitality, few &s;trangers com|ing to the we&s;tern country, and not &s;pending &s;ome days at the cro&s;&s;ings of the Yochaghany riv|er, where he lived; no man therefore could be more regretted.</P>

<HEAD>THE NARRATIVE OF JOHN SLOVER.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the la&s;t war been a pri&s;oner a|mong&s;t the Indians many years, and &s;o be|ing well acquainted with the country we&s;t of the Ohio I was employed as a guide in the expediti|on under Col. William Crawford again&s;t the In|dian towns on or near the river Sandusky. It will be unnece&s;&s;ary for me to relate what is &s;o well known, the circum&s;tances and unfortunate event of that expedition; it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that having on Tue&s;day the fourth of June fought the enemy near Sandusky, we lay that night in our camp, and the next day fired on each other at the di&s;tance of three hundred yards, doing little or no execution. In the evening of that day it was propo&s;ed by Col. Crawford, as I have been &s;ince informed, to draw off with or|der; but at the moment of our retreat the Indi|ans (who had probably perceived that we were about to retire) firing alarm guns, our men broke and rode off in confu&s;ion, treading down tho&s;e who were on foot, and leaving the wounded men who &s;upplicated to be taken with them.</P>
<P>I was with &s;ome others on the rear of our troops feeding our hor&s;es on the glade, when our men
<PB N="23" REF="035689_0022_1005F09E856D09C0">
began to break: The main body of our people had pa&s;&s;ed by me a con&s;iderable di&s;tance before I was ready to &s;et out. I overtook them before they cro&s;&s;ed the glade, and was advanced almo&s;t in front. The company in which I was, had &s;ep|arated from me, and had endeavoured to pa&s;s a mora&s;s; for coming up, I found their hor&s;es had &s;tuck fa&s;t in the mora&s;s, and endeavouring to pa&s;s mine al&s;o in a &s;hort time &s;tuck fa&s;t. I ought to have &s;aid, the company of five or &s;ix men with which I had been immediately connected, and who were &s;ome di&s;tance to the right of the main body, and had &s;eparated from me, &amp;c. I tryed a long time to di&s;engage my hor&s;e, until I could hear the enemy ju&s;t behind me, and on each &s;ide, but in vain. Here then I was obliged to leave him. The mora&s;s was &s;o un&s;table that I was to the middle in it, and it was with the greate&s;t dif|ficulty that I got acro&s;s it, but which having at length done, I came up with the &s;ix men who had left their hor&s;es in the &s;ame manner I had done; two of the&s;e, my companions, having lo&s;t their guns.</P>
<P>We travelled that night making our cour&s;e to|wards Detroit, with a view to &s;hun the enemy, who we conceived to have taken the paths by which the main body of our people had retreated. Ju&s;t before day we got into a &s;econd deep mora&s;s and were under the nece&s;&s;ity of detaining until it was light to &s;ee our way through it. The whole of this day we travelled towards the Shawane&s;e towns, with a view of throwing our&s;elves &s;till farther out of the &s;earch of the enemy. About
<PB N="24" REF="035689_0023_100627FF46D5D8F0">
ten o'clock this day we &s;at down to eat a little, having ta&s;ted nothing from Tue&s;day, the day of our engagement, until this time which was on Thur&s;day; and now the only thing we had to eat was a &s;crap of pork to each. We had &s;at down ju&s;t by a warrior's path which we had not &s;u&s;|pected, when eight or nine warriors appeared. Running off ha&s;tily we left our baggage and pro|vi&s;ions, but were not di&s;covered by the party; for &s;culking &s;ome time in the gra&s;s and bu&s;hes, we returned to the place and recovered our baggage. The warriors had hallooed as they pa&s;&s;ed, and were an&s;wered by others on our flanks.</P>
<P>In our journey through the glades, or wide ex|tended dry meadows, about twelve o'clock this day we di&s;covered a party of Indians in front, but &s;culking in the gra&s;s and bu&s;hes were not per|ceived by them. In the&s;e glades we were in great danger, as we could be &s;een at a great di&s;|tance. In the afternoon of this day there fell a heavy rain, the colde&s;t I ever felt. We halted while it rained, and then travelling on we &s;aw a party of the enemy about two hundred yards be|fore us, but hiding our&s;elves in the bu&s;hes, we had again the good fortune not to be di&s;covered. This night we got out of the glades, having in the night cro&s;&s;ed the paths by which we had ad|vanced to Sandusky. It was our de&s;ign to leave all the&s;e paths to the right, and to come in by the Tu&s;carawas. We &s;hould have made a much greater progre&s;s, had it not been for two of our companions who were lame; the one having his foot burnt, the other with a &s;welling in his knee, of a rheumatic nature.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="035689_0024_10062801C4238A30">On this day, which was the &s;econd after the re|treat, one of our company, the per&s;on affected with the rheumatic &s;welling, was left behind &s;ome di&s;tance in a &s;wamp. Waiting for him &s;ometime we &s;aw him coming within one hundred yards, as I &s;at on the body of an old tree mending my mok|ki&s;ons, but taking my eye from him I &s;aw him no more. He had not ob&s;erved our tracks, but had gone a different way. We whi&s;tled on our charg|ers, and afterwards hallooed for him but in vain. Neverthele&s;s he was fortunate in mi&s;&s;ing us, for he afterwards came &s;afe into Wheeling. We trav|elled on until night, and were on the waters of Muskingum from the middle of this day.</P>
<P>Having catched a fawn this day we made a fire in the evening, and had a repa&s;t, having in the mean time eat nothing but the &s;mall bit of pork I mentioned before. We &s;et off at break of day. About nine o'clock the third day we fell in with a party of the enemy about twenty miles from the Tu&s;carawas, which is about 135 miles from Fort Pitt. They had come upon our tracks, or had been on our flanks, and di&s;covered us, and then having got before had way-laid us, &amp; fired before we perceived them. At the fir&s;t fire one of my companions fell before me, and another ju&s;t be|hind; the&s;e two had guns: Tnere were &s;ix men in company, and four guns, two of the&s;e rendered u&s;ele&s;s by rea&s;on of the wet, when coming thro' the &s;wamp the fir&s;t night; we had tried to di&s;|charge them, but could not. When the Indians fired I ran to a tree, but an Indian pre&s;enting him|&s;elf fifteen yards before me, de&s;ired me to deliver
<PB N="26" REF="035689_0025_1006280347CABC58">
my&s;elf up and I &s;hould not be hurt: My gun was in good order, but apprehending the enemy be|hind might di&s;charge their pieces at me, I did not risk firing, which I had afterwards rea&s;on to regret when I found what was to be my fate, and that the Indian who was before me and pre&s;ented his gun, was one of tho&s;e who had ju&s;t before fired. Two of my companions were taken with me in the &s;ame manner, the Indians a&s;&s;uring us we &s;hould not be hurt. But one in company, James Paul, who had a gun in order made his e&s;|cape, and has &s;ince come into Wheeling. One of the&s;e Indians knew me, and was of the party by whom I was taken in the la&s;t war. He came up to and &s;poke to me, calling me by my Indian name, Mannuchcothee, and upbrading me for coming to war again&s;t them. I will take a moment here to relate &s;ome particulars of my fir&s;t captivity, and my life &s;ince.</P>
<P>I was taken from New River, in Virginia, by the Miame&s;e, a nation of Indians by us called the Picts, among&s;t whom I lived &s;ix years; afterwards being &s;old to a Delaware, and by him put into the hands of a trader, I was carried among&s;t the Shawane&s;e, with whom I continued &s;ix years; &s;o that my whole time among&s;t the&s;e nations was 12 years, that is, from the eighth to the twentieth year of my age. At the treaty at Fort Pitt in the fall preceding what is called Dunmore's war, which, if I am right, was in the year '73, I came in with the Shawane&s;e nation to the treaty, and meeting with &s;ome of my relations at that place, was by them &s;olicited to relinqui&s;h the life of a
<PB N="27" REF="035689_0026_1005F0A05C4E79A8">
&s;avage, which I did with &s;ome reluctance, this manner of life having become natural to me, in|a&s;much as I had &s;carcely known any other. I en|li&s;ted as a &s;oldier in the Continental army at the commencement of the pre&s;ent war, and &s;erved fifteen months. Having been properly di&s;charg|ed I have &s;ince married, have a family, and am in communion with the church.</P>
<P>To return: The party by whom we were made pri&s;oners had taken &s;ome hor&s;es, and left them at the glades we had pa&s;&s;ed the day before. They had followed on our tracks from the&s;e glades; on our return to which we found the hor&s;es and rode. We were carried towachatomakak, a town of the Mingoes and Shawane&s;e. I think it was on the third day we reached the town, which when we were approaching, the Indians, in who&s;e cu&s;tody we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, began to look &s;our, having been kind to us before, and given us a little meat and flour to eat, which they had found or taken from &s;ome of our men on their retreat. This town is &s;mall, and we were told was about two miles di&s;tant from the main town, to which they meant to carry us.</P>
<P>The inhabitants from this town came out with clubs and tomahawks &s;truck, beat and abu&s;ed us greatly. One of my two companions they &s;eized and having &s;tripped him naked, blacked him with coal and water: This was the &s;ign of being burnt: The man &s;eemed to &s;urmi&s;e it, and &s;hed tears. He asked me the meaning of his being blacked; but I was forbid by the enemy in their own language to tell him what was intended.&mdash; In Engli&s;h, which they &s;poke ea&s;ily, having been
<PB N="28" REF="035689_0027_10062804CD0F7D98">
often at Fort Pitt, they a&s;&s;ured him he was not to be hurt. I know of no rea&s;on for making him the fir&s;t object of their cruelty, unle&s;s it was that he was the olde&s;t.</P>
<P>A warrior had been &s;ent to the greater town to acquaint them with our coming, and prepare them for the frolic; for on our coming to it, the inhabitants came out with guns, clubs and toma|hawks. We were told that we had to run to the council hou&s;e, about three hundred yards. The man that was blacked was about twenty yards be|fore us, in running the guantlet: They made him their principal object, men, women and children beating him, and tho&s;e who had guns firing loads of powder on him as he run naked, putting the muzzles of the guns to his body, &s;houting, hal|looing and beating their drums in the mean time.</P>
<P>The unhappy man had reached the door of the council hou&s;e, beat and wounded in a manner &s;hocking to the &s;ight: for having arrived before him we had it in our power to view the &s;pectacle: it was indeed the mo&s;t horrid that can be con|ceived: They had cut him with their tomahawks &s;hot his body black, burnt it into holes with loads of powder blown into him: A large wadding had made a wound in his &s;houlder whence the blood gu&s;hed.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the declaration of the enemy when he fir&s;t &s;et out, he had rea&s;on to think him|&s;elf &s;ecure when he had reached the door of the council hou&s;e. This &s;eemed to be his hope, for coming up with great &s;truggling and endeavour, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hold of the door but was pulled back and
<PB N="29" REF="035689_0028_10062808688E7240">
drawn away by them; finding they intended no mercy, but putting him to death he attempted &s;everal times to &s;natch or lay hold of &s;ome of their tomahawks, but being weak could not af|fect it. We &s;aw him borne off and they were a long time beating, wounding, pur&s;uing and killing him.</P>
<P>That &s;ame evening I &s;aw the dead body of this man clo&s;e by the council hou&s;e. It was mang|led cruelly and the blood mingled with the pow|der was rendered black. The &s;ame evening I &s;aw him, after he had been cut into pieces and his limbs and his head about two hundred yards on the out&s;ide of the town put on poles. That e|vening al&s;o I &s;aw the bodies of three others in the &s;ame black and mangled condition: The&s;e I was told had been put to death the &s;ame day and ju&s;t before we had reached the town. Their bo|dies as they lay were black, bloody, and burnt with powder; two of the&s;e were Harri&s;on, and young Crawford. I knew the vi&s;age of Colonel Harri&s;on, and I &s;aw his cloathing and that of young Crawford, at the town. They brought hor&s;es to me and asked if I knew them?&mdash;I &s;aid they were Harri&s;on's and Crawford's. They &s;aid they were.</P>
<P>The third of the&s;e men I did not know, but be|lieve to have been Col. M'Cleland, the third in command on the expedition.</P>
<P>The next day the bodies of the&s;e men were dragged to the out&s;ide of the town, and their carca&s;es being given to the dogs, their limbs and heads were &s;tuck on poles.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="035689_0029_10062809EC1216D8">My &s;urviving companion &s;hortly after we had reached the council hou&s;e was &s;ent to another town, and I pre&s;ume he was burnt or executed in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>In the evening the men a&s;&s;embled in the coun|cil hou&s;e; This is a large building about fifty yards in length and about twenty five yards wide; and about &s;ixteen feet in height, built of &s;plit poles covered with bark: Their fir&s;t object was to examine me, which they could do in their own language, ina&s;much as I could &s;peak the Miame, Shawane&s;e and Delaware languages, which I had learned during my early captivity in the la&s;t war: I found I had not forgotten the&s;e languages, e&s;|pecially the two former, being able to &s;peak them as well as my native tongue.</P>
<P>They began with interrogating me concerning the &s;ituation of our country, what were our pro|vi&s;ions? our numbers? the &s;tate of the war be|tween us and Britain? I informed them Corn|wallis had been taken, which next day, when Matthew Elliot, with James Girty, came, they affirmed to be a lie, and the Indians &s;eemed to give full credit to their declarations.</P>
<P>Hitherto I had been treated with &s;ome appear|ance of kindne&s;s, but now the enemy began to alter their behaviour towards me. Girty had in|formed them, that when he asked me how I liked to live there, I had &s;aid that I intended to take the fir&s;t opportunity to take a &s;calp and run off. It was, to be &s;ure, very probable that if I had &s;uch intention, I would communicate it to him. A|nother
<PB N="31" REF="035689_0030_1005F0A5174FB278">
man came to me and told me a &s;tory of his having lived on the &s;outh branch of Potowmac in Virginia, and having three brothers there, he pretended he wanted to get away, but I &s;u&s;pect|ed his de&s;ign; neverthele&s;s he reported that I had con&s;ented to go. In the mean time I was not tied and could have e&s;caped, but having nothing to put on my feet, I waited &s;ome time longer to pro|vide for this.</P>
<P>I was invited every night to the war dances, which they u&s;ually continued until almo&s;t day. I could not comply with their de&s;ire, believing the&s;e things to be the &s;ervice of the devil.</P>
<P>The council la&s;ted fifteen days; from fifty to one hundred warriors being u&s;ually in coun|cil, and &s;ometimes more. Every warrior is ad|mitted to the&s;e councils; but only the chiefs or head warriors have the privilege of &s;peaking. The head warriors are accounted &s;uch from the number of &s;calps and pri&s;oners they have taken.</P>
<P>The third day M'Kee was in council, and afterwards was generally pre&s;ent. He &s;poke little, and did not ask any que&s;tions or &s;peak to me at all. He lives about two miles out of the town, has a hou&s;e built of &s;quared logs with a &s;hingled roof; he was dre&s;&s;ed in gold laced cloaths. I had &s;een him at the former town through which I pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I think it was on the la&s;t day of the council, &s;ave one, that a &s;peech came from Detroit, brought by a warrior who had been coun&s;eling with the commanding officer at that place. The &s;peech had been long expected, and was
<PB N="32" REF="035689_0031_1006280D5D25BF08">
in an&s;wer to one &s;ometime before &s;ent from the town to Detroit: It was in a belt of Wampum and began with addre&s;&s;ing them, "My child|ren," and enquiring why they continued to take pri&s;oners? "Provi&s;ions are &s;carce; when pri&s;oners are brought in we are obliged to main|tain them, and &s;till &s;ome of them are running away, and carrying tidings of our affairs. When any of your people fall into the hands of the rebels they &s;hew no mercy: why then &s;hould you take pri&s;oners? Take no more pri&s;oners, my children, of any &s;ort; man, woman or child."</P>
<P>Two days after a party of every nation that was near being collected, it was determined on to take no more pri&s;oners of any &s;ort. They had held a large council, and the determination was, that if it where po&s;&s;ible they could find a child of a &s;pan or three inches long, they would &s;how no mercy to it. At the conclu&s;ion of the council it was agreed upon by all the tribes pre&s;ent, viz. the Tawaws, Chiappawaws the Wiondots, the Mingoes, the Delawares, the Shawane&s;e, the Mun&s;es, and a part of the Che|rokees, that &s;hould any of the nation who were not pre&s;ent take any pri&s;oner, the&s;e would ri&s;e again&s;t them, take away the pri&s;oners and put them to death.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e deliberations I under|&s;tood what was &s;aid perfectly. They laid plans again&s;t our &s;ettlements of Kentucky, the Falls, and towards Wheeling. The&s;e it will be unne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to mention in this narrative, more e&s;pecially as the Indians finding me to have
<PB N="33" REF="035689_0032_1006280EE07F6D70">
e&s;caped, and knowing that I would not fail to communicate the&s;e de&s;igns, will be led to alter their re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>There was one council held at which I was not pre&s;ent: The warriors had &s;ent for me as u&s;ual, but the &s;quaw with whom I lived would not &s;uffer me to go, but hid me under a large quantity of skins. It may have been from an unwillingne&s;s that I &s;hould hear in council the determination with re&s;pect to me, that I &s;hould be burnt.</P>
<P>About this time twelve men were brought in from Kentucky, three of whom were burnt on this day: The remainder were di&s;tributed to other towns, and all as the Indians informed me, were burnt. This was after the &s;peech came from Detroit.</P>
<P>On this day al&s;o I &s;aw an Indian who had ju&s;t come into town, and who &s;aid that the pri|&s;oner he was bringing to be burnt, and who he &s;aid was a doctor, had made his e&s;cape from him. I knew this mu&s;t have been Dr. Knight, who went as &s;urgeon of the expedition. The Indian had a wound four inches long in his head which he acknowledged the doctor had given him: he was cut to the &s;cull. His &s;tory was, that he had untied the doctor, being asked by him to do &s;o, the doctor promi&s;ing that he would not go away; that while he was employed in kindling the fire, the doctor &s;natched up the gun, had come behind and &s;truck him: that he then made a &s;troke at the doctor with his knife, which he laid hold of, and his fingers were cut
<PB N="34" REF="035689_0033_100628126F136C10">
almo&s;t off, the knife being drawn through his hand; that he gave the doctor two &s;tabs, one in the belly, the other in the back; &s;aid the doctor was a great, big, tall, &s;trong man. Being now adopted in an Indian family, and having &s;ome confidence for my &s;afety, I took the liberty to contradict this, and &s;aid that I knew the doctor who was a weak, little man. The other warriors laughed immoderately, and did not &s;eem to credit him. At this time I was told that Col. Crawford was burnt, and they greatly exulted over it.</P>
<P>The day after the council I have mentioned about forty warriors accompanied by George Girty came early in the morning round the hou&s;e where I was. The &s;quaw gave me up; I was &s;itting before the door of the hou&s;e; they put a rope round my neck, tied my arms behind my back, &s;tripped me naked, and blacked me in the u&s;ual manner. George Girty as &s;oon as I was tied, damned me, and &s;aid that I now &s;hould get what I had de&s;erved many years. I was led a|way to a town di&s;tant about five miles, to which a me&s;&s;enger had been di&s;patched to de&s;ire them them to prepare to receive me: Arriving at this town I was beaten with clubs and the pipe ends of their tomahawks, and was kept for &s;ome time tied to a tree before a hou&s;e door. In the mean while the inhabitants &s;et out to another town a|bout two miles di&s;tant, where I was to be burnt, and where I arrived about three o'clock in the af|ternoon.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o was a council hou&s;e, part of it cover|ed, and part of it without a roof. In the part of
<PB N="35" REF="035689_0034_100628160EF89888">
it where no cover was, but only &s;ides built up, there &s;tood a po&s;t about &s;ixteen feet in height, and in the middle of the hou&s;e around the po&s;t, there were three piles of wood built about three feet high and four feet from the po&s;t. Being brought to the po&s;t my arms were tied behind me and the thong or cord with which they were bound was fa&s;tened to the po&s;t; a rope al&s;o was put about my neck and tied to the po&s;t about four feet above my head. During the time they were tying me, piles of wood were kindled and began to flame.</P>
<P>Death by burning, which appeared to be now my fate, I had re&s;olved to &s;u&s;tain with patience. The divine grace of God had made it le&s;s alarm|ing to me: for on my way this day, I had been greatly exerci&s;ed in regard to my latter end. I knew my&s;elf to have been a regular member of the church, and to have &s;ought repentance for my &s;ins; but though I had often heard of the faith of a&s;&s;urance, had known nothing of it; but ear|ly this day, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly by a change wrought upon me &s;udden and perceivable as lightning, an a&s;&s;urance of my peace made with God &s;prung up in my mind. The following words were the &s;ub|ject of my meditation&mdash;"In peace thou &s;halt &s;ee God. Fear not tho&s;e who can kill the body. In peace &s;halt thou depart." I was on this occa&s;i|on by a confidence in mind, not to be re&s;i&s;ted, fully a&s;&s;ured of my &s;alvation: This being the ca&s;e, I was willing, &s;atisfied, and glad to die.</P>
<P>I was tied to the po&s;t, as I have already &s;aid, and the flame was now kindled. The day was
<PB N="36" REF="035689_0035_1006281791293FE0">
clear, not a cloud to be &s;een: if there were clouds low in the horizon, the &s;ides of the hou&s;e pre|vented me from &s;eeing them, but I heard no thunder, or ob&s;erved any &s;ign of approaching rain. Ju&s;t as the fire of one pile began to blaze, the wind ro&s;e; from the time they began to kin|dle the fire and to tie me to the po&s;t, until the wind began to blow, was about fifteen minutes. The wind blew a hurricane, and the rain followed in le&s;s than three minutes. The rain fell violent, and the fire, though it began to blaze con&s;idera|bly, was in&s;tantly extingui&s;hed. The rain la&s;ted about a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>When it was over, the &s;avages &s;tood amazed and were a long time &s;ilent. At la&s;t one &s;aid, we will let him alone till morning, and take a whole day's frolic in burning him. The &s;un at this time was about three hours high. It was agreed upon and the rope about my neck was untied, and mak|ing me &s;it down, they began to dance around me. They continued dancing in this manner until e|leven o'clock at night; in the mean time, beating kicking, and wounding me with their tomahawks and clubs.</P>
<P>At la&s;t one of the warriors, the Half Moon, asked me if I was &s;leepy? I an&s;wered, Yes. The head warrior then cho&s;e out three men to take care of me. I was taken to a block hou&s;e; my arms were tied until the cord was hid in the fle&s;h; they were tied in two places, round the wri&s;t and above the elbows. A rope was fa&s;tened about my neck, and tied to a beam of the hou&s;e, but permitting me to lie down on a board. The three
<PB N="37" REF="035689_0036_1006281A60256E60">
warriors were con&s;tantly harra&s;&s;ing and troubling me, &s;aying, "How will you like to eat fire to|morrow&mdash;you will kill no more Indians now." I was in expectation of their going to &s;leep; when at length, about an hour before day break, two laid down; the third &s;moked a pipe, talked to me, and asked the &s;ame painful que&s;tions. A|bout half an hour after, he al&s;o laid down and I heard him begin to &s;nore.&mdash;In&s;tantly I went to work, and as my arms were perfectly dead with the cord, I laid my&s;elf down upon my right arm which was behind my back, and keep|ing it fa&s;t with my fingers, which had &s;till &s;ome life and &s;trength, I &s;lipped the cord from my left arm over my elbow and my wri&s;t. One of the warriors now got up and &s;tirred the fire: I was apprehen&s;ive that I &s;hould be examined, and thought it was over with me; but my hopes revi|ved when now he lay down again. I then at|tempted to unloo&s;e the rope about my neck, tried to gnaw it but in vain, as it was as thick as my thumb and as hard as iron, being made of a buf|faloe hide: I wrought with it a long time, gave it out, and could &s;ee no relief. At this time I &s;aw day break and heard the cock crow: I made a &s;econd attempt almo&s;t without hope, pulling the rope by putting my fingers between my neck &amp; it, &amp; to my great &s;urpri&s;e it came ea&s;ily untied: It was a noo&s;e with two or three knots tied over it.</P>
<P>I &s;tept over the warriors as they lay, and hav|ing got out of the hou&s;e looked back to &s;ee if there was any di&s;turbance; I then run through the town into a corn field; in my way I &s;aw a &s;quaw with four or five children lying a&s;leep un|der
<PB N="38" REF="035689_0037_1006281BE86BD6E0">
a tree: Going a different way into the field I untied my arm which was greatly &s;welled and turned black: Having ob&s;erved a number of hor|&s;es in the glade as I ran through it, I went back to catch one, and on my way found a piece of an old rug or quilt hanging on a fence which I took with me: Having caught the hor&s;e, the rope with which I had been tied &s;erving for a halter, I rode off; the hor&s;e was &s;trong and &s;wift, and and the woods being open and the country level, about ten o'clock that day I cro&s;&s;ed the Sciota river at a place by computation fifty full miles from the town. I had rode about twenty miles on this &s;ide Sciota by three o'clock in the afternoon, when the hor&s;e began to fail and could no longer go on a trot. I in&s;tantly left him and ran on foot about twenty miles farther that day, making in the whole the di&s;tance of near one hundred miles. In the evening I heard hallooing behind me and for this rea&s;on did not halt until about ten o'clock at night, when I &s;at down, was extremely &s;ick and vomited; but when the moon ro&s;e which might have been a|bout two hours after, I went on and travelled un|til day.</P>
<P>During the night I had a path, but in the morning judged it prudent to for&s;ake the path and take a ridge for the di&s;tance of fifteen miles in a line at right angles to my cour&s;e, putting back as I went along with a &s;tick the weeds which I had bended, le&s;t I &s;hould be tracked by the enemy. I lay the next night on the waters of Muskingum: The nettles had been trouble|&s;ome to me after my cro&s;&s;ing the Sciota, having
<PB N="39" REF="035689_0038_1006281FA5200358">
nothing to defend my&s;elf but the piece of a rug which I had found, and which while I rode I u&s;ed under me by way of &s;addle; the briars and thorns were now painful to and prevented me from tra|velling in the night until the moon appeared: In the mean time I was hindered from &s;leeping by the mu&s;quetoes, for even in the day I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of travelling with a handful of bu&s;h|es to bru&s;h them from my body.</P>
<P>The &s;econd night I reached Cu&s;hakim; next day came to Newcomer's town, where I got a|bout &s;even rasberries, which were the fir&s;t thing I ate from the morning in which the Indians had taken me to burn me until this time, which was now about three o'clock the fourth day. I felt hunger very little, but was extremely weak; I &s;wam Muskingum river at Oldcomer's town, the river being about two hundred yards wide; hav|ing reached the bank I &s;at down, looked back and thought I had a &s;tart of the Indians if any &s;hould pur&s;ue. That evening I travelled about five miles, next day came to Stillwater, a &s;mall river, in a branch of which I got two &s;mall cra|fi&s;h to eat: Next night I lay within five miles of Wheeling, but had not &s;lept a wink during this whole time, being rendered impo&s;&s;ible by the mu&s;quetoes, which it was my con&s;tant employ|ment to bru&s;h away. Next day came to Wheel|ing and &s;aw a man on the i&s;land in the Ohio oppo|&s;ite to that po&s;t, and calling to him and asking for particular per&s;ons who had been on the expedi|tion, and telling him I was Slover, at length, with great difficulty, he was pur&s;uaded to come over and bring me acro&s;s in his canoe.</P>

<HEAD>A NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTIVITY AND ESCAPE OF <HI>Mrs.</HI> FRANCES SCOTT, An Inhabitant of Wa&s;hington County, Virginia.</HEAD>
<P>ON Wedne&s;day the 29th day of June, 1785. late in the evening, a large company of armed men pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e, on their way to Kentucky: Some part of whom encamped with|in two miles. Mr. Scott living on a frontier part, generally made the family watchful; but on this calamitous day, after &s;o large a body of men had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hortly after night, he lay down in his bed, and imprudently left one of the doors of his hou&s;e open; the children were al&s;o in bed, and a&s;leep. Mrs. Scott was nearly un|dre&s;&s;ed, when to her unutterable a&s;toni&s;hment and horror, &s;he &s;aw ru&s;hing in through the door that was left open, painted &s;avages with pre|&s;ented arms, rai&s;ing a hideous &s;hriek&mdash;Mr. Scott being awake, in&s;tantly jumped out of his bed, but was immediately fired at: He forced his way through the middle of the enemy and got out of the door, but fell a few paces from thence. An Indian &s;eized Mrs. Scott, and ordered her
<PB N="41" REF="035689_0040_100628251BA6A0E8">
to a particular &s;pot, and not to move; others &s;tabbed and cut the throats of the three younge&s;t children in their bed, and afterwards lifted them up and da&s;hed them down on the floor, near the mother; the elde&s;t, a beautiful girl of eight years old, awoke and e&s;caped out of bed, and ran to her parent, and, with the mo&s;t plaintive ac|cents, cried, "O mama! mama! &s;ave me"&mdash;the mother, in the deepe&s;t angui&s;h of &s;pirit, and with a flood of tears, intreated the &s;avages to &s;pare her child; but, with a brutal fiercene&s;s, they tomahawked and &s;tabbed her in the mothers arms. Adjacent to Mr. Scott's dwelling hou&s;e another family lived, of the name of Ball.&mdash; The Indians al&s;o attacked them at the &s;ame in|&s;tant they did Mr. Scott's, but the door being &s;hut, the enemy fired into the hou&s;e through an opening between two logs, and killed a young lad, and then e&s;&s;ayed to force the door open; but a &s;urviving brother fired through the door, and the enemy de&s;i&s;ted, and went off: The re|maining part of the family ran out of the hou&s;e and e&s;caped. In Mr. Scott's hou&s;e were four good rifles well loaded, and a good deal of clothing, and furniture, part of which belonged to people that had left it on their way to Ken|tucky. The Indians loaded them&s;elves with the plunder, being 13 in number, then &s;peedily made off, and continued travelling all night; next morning their chief allotted to each man his &s;hare and detached nine of a party to &s;teal hor&s;es from the inhabitants of Clinch. The eleventh day after Mrs. Scotts captivity, the four Indians that
<PB N="42" REF="035689_0041_10062827A6FDC020">
had her in charge, &s;topped at a place fixed upon for a rendezvous, and to hunt, being now in great want of provi&s;ions. Three went out, and the chief, being an old man, was left to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> care of the pri&s;oner, who, by this time, expre&s;&s;ed a will|ingne&s;s to proceed to the Indian towns, which &s;eemed to have the de&s;ired effect of le&s;&s;ening her keeper's vigilance. In the day time, as the old man was graining a deer skin, the captive pon|dering on her &s;ituation, and anxiou&s;ly looking for an opportunity to make her e&s;cape, took the re&s;olution, and went to the Indian carele&s;sly, asked liberty to go a &s;mall di&s;tance to a &s;tream of water, to wa&s;h the blood off her apron, that had remained be&s;meared &s;ince the fatal night of the murder of her little daughter. He told her in the Engli&s;h tongue "go along;" &s;he then pa&s;&s;|ed by him, his face being in a contrary direction from that &s;he was going, and he very bu&s;y. She after getting to the water, proceeded on without delay, made to a high barren mountain, and tra|velled until late in the evening, when &s;he came down into the valley, in &s;earch of the track &s;he had been taken along; hoping thereby to find the way back, without the risk of being lo&s;t, and peri&s;hing with hunger in uninhabited parts. On coming acro&s;s the valley to the river &s;ide, &s;uppo&s;|ed to be the ea&s;terly branch of Kentucky river, &s;he ob&s;erved in the &s;and, tracks of two men, that had gone up the river, and had ju&s;t returned. She concluded the&s;e to have been her pur&s;uers, which excited emotions of gratitude and thankfulne&s;s to divine providence for &s;o timous a deliverance.
<PB N="43" REF="035689_0042_1005F0A6A5ED4250">
Being without any provi&s;ions, having no kind of weapon or tool to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in getting any, and being almo&s;t de&s;titute of cloathing, al&s;o knowing that a va&s;t tract of rugged high mountains inter|vened, between where &s;he was and the inhabitants ea&s;twardly, and the di&s;tance of the Kentucky &s;et|tlements unknown, and &s;he almo&s;t as ignorant as a child of the method of &s;teering through the woods, excited painful &s;en&s;ations. But certain death, either by hunger or wild bea&s;ts, &s;eemed preferable rather than to be in the power of be|ings, who had excited in her mind &s;uch horror. She addre&s;&s;ed heaven for protection, and taking courage, proceeded onward. After travelling three days, &s;he had nearly met with the Indians, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, that had been &s;ent to Clinch to &s;teal hor&s;es, but providentially hearing their ap|proach, concealed her&s;elf among the cane, until the enemy had pa&s;&s;ed. This giving a fre&s;h alarm and her mind being filled with con&s;ternation, &s;he got lo&s;t, proceeding backwards and forwards for &s;everal days; at length &s;he came to a river, that &s;eemed to come from the ea&s;t; concluding it was Sandy river, &s;he accordingly re&s;olved to trace it to its &s;ource, which is adjacent to the Clinch &s;et|tlements. After proceeding up the &s;ame &s;everal days, &s;he came to where the river runs through the great Laurel mountain, where is a prodigi|ous water-fall, and numerous high craggy cliffs along the water edge; that way &s;eemed impa&s;&s;|able, the mountain &s;teep and difficult: However, our mournful traveller concluded that the latter way was the be&s;t. She therefore a&s;cended for
<PB N="44" REF="035689_0043_1006282B52E013B8">
&s;ome time, but coming to a range of inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, &s;he turned her cour&s;e towards the foot of the mountain and the river &s;ide; After getting in|to a deep gulley, and pa&s;&s;ing over &s;everal high &s;teep rocks, &s;he reached the river &s;ide, where, to her inexpre&s;&s;ible affliction, &s;he found that a per|pendicular rock or rather one that hung over of 15 or 20 feet high, formed the bank. Here a &s;o|lemn pau&s;e took place; &s;he e&s;&s;ayed to return, but the height of the &s;teeps and rocks &s;he had de&s;cended over, prevented her. She then re|turned to the edge of the precipice, and viewed the bottom of it, as the certain &s;pot to end all her troubles, or remain on the top to pine away with hunger, or be devoured by wild bea&s;ts. After &s;erious meditation, and devout exerci&s;es, &s;he de|termined on leaping from the height, and accord|ingly jumped off. Although the place &s;he had to alight was covered with uneven rocks, not a bone was broken; but, being exceedingly &s;tun|ned with the fall, &s;he remained unable to proceed for &s;ome &s;pace of time. The dry &s;ea&s;on cau&s;ed the river to be &s;hallow&mdash;&s;he travelled in it, and where &s;he could, by its edge, until &s;he got thro' the mountain, which &s;he concluded was &s;everal miles. After this, as &s;he was travelling along the bank of the river, a venemous &s;nake bit her on the ancle: She had &s;trength to kill, and knowing its kind, concluded that death mu&s;t &s;oon over|take her. By this time, Mrs. Scott was reduced to a mere skeleton with fatigue, hunger and grief: probably this &s;tate of her body was the means, of pre&s;erving her from the effects of the poi&s;on: be

that as it may, &s;o it was, that very little pain &s;uc|ceeded the bite, and what little &s;welling there was, it fell into her feet. Our wanderer now left the river, and after proceeding a good di&s;tance, &s;he came to where the valley parted into two, each leading a different cour&s;e. Here a painful &s;u&s;pence again took place: A forlorn creature, almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, and certain, if &s;he was far led out of the way, &s;he would never &s;ee a human creature&mdash;During this &s;oliloque, a beautiful bird pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by her flattering along the ground, and went out of &s;ight up one of the valleys.&mdash; This drew her attention, and whil&s;t con&s;idering what it might mean, another bird of the &s;ame ap|pearance in like manner fluttered pa&s;t her, and took the &s;ame valley the other had done This determined her choice of the way; and in two days which was on the 11th day of Augu&s;t, &s;he reached that &s;ettlement on Clinch, called New-Garden; whereas (&s;he is &s;ince informed by wood men) had &s;he taken the other valley, it would have led her back towards the Ohio. Mrs. Scott relates, that the Indians told her, that the party was compo&s;ed of four different nations, two of whom &s;he thinks they named Delawares and Mingoes.</P>
<P>She further relates, that during her wandering from the tenth of July to the eleventh of Augu&s;t, &s;he had no other &s;ub&s;i&s;tance but chewing and &s;wallowing the juice of young cane-&s;talks, Sa&s;&s;a&s;ras leaves, and &s;ome other plants &s;he did not know the names of; that, on her journey, &s;he &s;aw Buffaloes, Elks, Deer, and frequently

Bears and Wolves; not one of which, although &s;ome pa&s;&s;ed very near her, offered to do her the lea&s;t harm. One day a Bear came near her, with a young Fawn in his mouth, and on di&s;covering her, he dropped his prey and ran off. Hunger prompted her to go and take the fle&s;h and eat it: but on reflection, &s;he de&s;i&s;ted, thinking that the Bear might return and devour her; be&s;ides &s;he had an aver&s;ion to ta&s;te raw fle&s;h.&mdash;Mrs. Scott continues in a low &s;tate of health, and remains incon&s;olable for the lo&s;s of her family, particu|larly bewailing the cruel death of her little daughter.</P>
