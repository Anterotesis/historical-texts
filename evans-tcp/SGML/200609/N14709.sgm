<HEAD>TO THE HONORABLE ROBERT MORRIS, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> FINANCIER GENERAL, OF THE UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>MEN of Letters who flatter the Muses, or think the Muses flatter them, and Men of pretended as well as approved Genius have always claimed the Privilege of inscribing their Flights of Fancy and their amusive Productions to the Great&mdash;not with|standing all their pretended Modesty, the Cause of which is soon guessed or sagaciously mistaken by every Reader.</HI></P>
<P><HI>With this precedent and a different Presumption; I the very Junior of all the Muses Children, have ventured to add Consequence to this Trifle, by introducing it to the World under your Name.&mdash;Those who may bestow so much Time as to peruse it will naturally wonder why I did so! I Will candidly confess that was any one to ask me the Question, I could not give them a satisfactory Answer; Perhaps it is of that delicate combination of Ideas that will not bear definition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is a Turn in the Ingenious and Studious different from the conceptions of the vulgar, that inspire them with a laudable Ambition of acquiring Fame; while the latter, the bulk of Society, are rather Prone to despise and ridicule, than to palliate or forgive, the Attempts of those who aim to instruct or to please; if not sanctioned by something conspicuous.&mdash;This, perhaps, is one Reason why your Name appears here.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Those who write for their own Amusement or Emolument are convinced from Experience, that their Advancement (at first) arises more from some happy Turn or Circumstance than real Merit; and tho' Merit will carry them through at the long Run, the Assistance brought by it alone seldom or never comes Time enough for the Object
<PB REF="018671_0003_0FA8062275595170">
that deserves it.&mdash;There is some living Examples, and abun|dance of dead ones&mdash;Some will suggest to themselves after reading this Paragraph that I am afraid of dying unnoticed&mdash;Indeed I own I am; but it is not every Reader that will have Candour enough to believe from what Reason.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For the Work I will say nothing: I am but too conscious of its Defects and Deficiencies and too well acquainted with your Merits to speak in favour of such a Bagatelle, to so judicious a Patron: It was the Employment of some leisure Hours, and the fattering Encomiums of a few Intimates, who seldom see the Faults of those they respect, made me a little vain to see it published; but while I ingenuously own this, I tremble, for I am well aware that Vanity often ends in Humility.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Words of a Dedication are generally the Language of Panegyrick, either so servily low, or disgustingly Flattering, that they mostly offend Modesty; but I hope I have not merited this Imputation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Little acquainted with the Great, I have not much to Hope from their Influence, and being above the Censures of the malignant, I have little to fear from their Malevolence. But by this Address to you, I have more than one Consolation, &mdash; your admiring the Attempt, and forgiving the Execution.</HI></P>

<L>GOOD gentle reader, when you choose</L>
<L>To hear of love, these lines peruse;</L>
<L>But if you ne'er have felt its force</L>
<L>Your pleasures here will have no source;</L>
<L>Then shut the book, and take another,</L>
<L>The tedious lines will only bother;</L>
<L>But should some serious hour obtrude,</L>
<L>With pleasing melancholy mood,</L>
<L>When every sense devoid of pride,</L>
<L>Thro' fancy's airy regions ride,</L>
<L>To mark each feeling of the heart,</L>
<L>Their changes know, their cares impart,</L>
<L>And, gathering home the various views,</L>
<L>Their merits note and worth peruse,</L>
<L>Then kindly read a line or two,</L>
<L>The author meant it but for you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And ah! forgive a young beginner,</L>
<L>A harmless, youthful, scribling sinner:</L>
<L>I seldom speak with muse or graces,</L>
<L>And seldomer have seen their faces;</L>
<L>The gods I never do invoke,</L>
<L>The writers say 'tis all a joke,</L>
<L>For men are grown so wond'rous wife</L>

<L>Ah! me! how can I hope to find</L>
<L>Reception tender, just or kind,</L>
<L>For any trifle that I write,</L>
<L>When men to gods would shew such spite?</L>
<L>&mdash;Besides, I never deal in rhyme,</L>

<L>No fears the tranquil mind molest;</L>

<L>Soft let me glide my moments past,</L>

<L>Marriage when unendear'd by love</L>

<HEAD>THE THUNDER-STORM, A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE rolling vapours drawn in volumes great,</L>
<L>Charg'd with the hursting ministers of fate,</L>
<L>With gloomy visage o'er the western sky,</L>
<L>Onward they move to tell the danger nigh;</L>
<L>While in his carr the sun's meridian beam</L>
<L>With touch aetherial 'wakes the pointed flame,</L>
<L>In dire commotion through the pugnant cloud,</L>
<L>Faintly afar, but nearer then more loud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Calmly at first the brooding storm is seen</L>
<L>To spread a low'ring darkness o'er the green;</L>
<L>The cattle gaze, the birds desert the air,</L>
<L>And to the shade the hen and chicks repair;</L>
<L>Fast to the cot the reapers hie away,</L>
<L>And waits the sun-beam to renew the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Low walks the gloom, the loaded terrors roll,</L>
<L>While inward torture strikes the troubled soul;</L>
<L>Guilt stands appall'd within the felon breast,</L>
<L>And in each look his crime is self-confest;</L>
<L>The murderer sees the ghost of him he slew</L>
<L>Rise up in judgment, horrid to his view,</L>
<L>While all his mind, to phrenzy wrought by fear,</L>
<L>Aims to repent as danger seems more near;</L>
<L>Sad expectation fills the heart of man,</L>
<L>And half afraid the virgins cheeks grow wan;</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="018671_0033_0FA8063E9C912028">
The youth from school, with visionary fright,</L>
<L>Beholds the gloom and runs with all his might.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence all this dread! why thus disturb'd the mind?</L>
<L>Sure God the warring elements can bind?</L>
<L>'Tis fearful sin, with troubles all its own,</L>
<L>By terror summon'd up to reasons throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so the man of philosophic eye,</L>
<L>He sagely waits each motion to desery,</L>
<L>And views, sublime, the forked lightning play,</L>
<L>And round him shed a moments horrid day.</L>
<L>Not frighted more than when the Zeyphers play'd</L>
<L>In wanton fragrance round his stud'ous head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! now it comes with horrid grow! along,</L>
<L>Clouds pil'd on clouds the threatning heavens throng;</L>
<L>Forth issuing darts the livid lightning down,</L>
<L>In twinkling streaks it smites the silent ground;</L>
<L>Then following quick the thunder lifts its voice,</L>
<L>Crush'd hoarsly horrible with troubled noise,</L>
<L>Peal dash'd on peal, the loaded murmurs roll,</L>
<L>And bursts resounded seem to shake the pole:</L>
<L>Flash'd brighter still, more sharp the groaning sounds,</L>
<L>While heaven and earth the echoing noise astounds;</L>
<L>Great nature trembles to her inmost womb,</L>
<L>Least threatning fate should chaos make her tomb&mdash;</L>
<L>Hark! as it roars! &mdash; see where its vengeance fell,</L>
<L>On the proud oak or in the rocky dell;</L>
<L>The castled-clif and cloud-assaulting spire</L>
<L>Sinks to the flash in tumbling atoms dire;</L>
<L>Struck on the cottage, fee the smoke arise</L>
<L>And trembling inmates gaze at troubled skies,</L>
<L>They, helpless children of misfortunes train,</L>
<L>Must feel the sad variety of pain.</L>

<L>Wide rent the clouds a watry torrent yield,</L>
<L>That grateful maturate the thirsting field:</L>
<L>At length subsided, all is peace again,</L>
<L>And momentary silence lulls the scene;</L>
<L>'Till in one general chorus all rejoice</L>
<L>To praise the hand that hush'd the thunders voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See where destruction marks the lightnings way:</L>
<L>But shall presumptuous man unknowing say</L>
<L>Whither 'twas justice, with unerring hand,</L>
<L>Or mercy dealt the blow at God's command.</L>

<L>LAMINTA form'd with every manly grace,</L>
<L>With ev'ry virtue shining in his face,</L>
<L>Had early sought MELINDA for a wife,</L>
<L>To sweeten all the joys of human life:</L>
<L>Coyly she heard the servent lover plead,</L>
<L>Seem'd to his prayers to give but little heed,</L>
<L>Or else to listen with a careless ear,</L>
<L>Whilst he with melting pleadings was sincere;</L>
<L>But still importunate LAMINTA prest,</L>
<L>'Till the coy maid her bashful flame confest,</L>
<L>Then who can speak the joy LAMINTA knew,</L>
<L>When to his wish he found MELINDA true?</L>
<L>Fondly he play'd in transport o'er her breast,</L>
<L>While silent rapture all his soul confest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ill-fated pair! to love each other so,</L>
<L>That death of one should prove the others woe!</L>
<L>If this O Love! be thy reward for truth,</L>
<L>May angels guard my L******'s tender youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With hearts elated to the church they went,</L>
<L>And on the road the time in mirth they spent;</L>
<L>Oft fondly picturing in the mimic mind</L>
<L>What future scenes of happiness they'd find.</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="018671_0035_0FA8064022342E08">
Alas! 'tis visionary all, and vain,</L>
<L>The fleeting phantoms of the formful brain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The nuptial knot with solemn joy was ty'd,</L>
<L>Then home the pair with pleasing prospects hied,</L>
<L>But ah! the storm their hasty steps with held,</L>
<L>While they for shelter sought a neighb'ring field:</L>
<L>There underneath a spreading tree they sat.</L>
<L>Indulging pastime in their simple chat;</L>
<L>And sporting heedless of the storm around,</L>
<L>A moments transitory joy they found:</L>
<L>When oh! the lightning, bursting o'er their head,</L>
<L>Struck in its course the poor LAMINTA dead!</L>
<L>But who can tell the pangs MELINDA felt?</L>
<L>She kiss'd and press'd, and o'er the corpse she knelt,</L>
<L>Wept o'er her dear, and still LAMINTA cried,</L>
<L>And still in aidless agony she sigh'd,</L>
<L>'Till nature, quite too delicate to bear</L>
<L>Such tender pain, such renovating care,</L>
<L>And reason wand'ring, phrenzy fir'd her mind,</L>
<L>Yielded to sorrow for LAMINTA kind.</L>
