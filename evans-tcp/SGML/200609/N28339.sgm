<P>O now we are all relieved at once? Dear Mr. Felix, from you I expect my sentence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Felix.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, dear Frederic, she is yours. I know your heart. The wine is yet fomenting, but it is good. Indeed, dear Nan|nette, you often will have to exercise your patience.</P>

<P>I'll have patience, dear papa.</P>

<SPEAKER>Brumb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Charles, you may do as you please, she is your daughter. But you are mistaken if you think that I shall ever be your wife again. I have cited you in all the pa|pers, and we have been formally divorced for your malicious desertion, as the lawyers call it. The consistory has wrote full twelve sheets about it, and put a large seal under it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not the least objection against it. Take, if you please, three husbands more, and get divorced three times more. My property you may keep, for the sake of the amiable daugh|ter you have given me.</P>
