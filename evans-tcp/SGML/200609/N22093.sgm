<SPEAKER>G. Friend. &s;en.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU and I, brother, ne|ver did, or ever will agree on this &s;ubject. You know the terms upon which I took your &s;on; I adopted him as my own child, and hold my&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for his conduct.</P>

<P>Little do&s;t thou know his cha|racter, and much do I repent of putting him under thy direction; it will be the ruin of him, &s;oul and body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. &s;en.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath, Jacob, what do you mean by &s;uch reflections? They are enough to make one quarrel with you outright. After all the expen&s;e I have been at, in giving him the fir&s;t-rate education, don't he po&s;&s;e&s;s all tho&s;e nece&s;|&s;ary accompli&s;hments which con&s;titute the agree|able
<PB N="14" REF="029129_0011_0FDFA8DBE761FC48">
companion&punc;&mdash;and yet you &s;ay I have ruin|ed him, &s;oul and body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Friend. &s;en.</SPEAKER>
<P>What thou doth call accom|pli&s;hments, brother, are what lead him the broad|way to de&s;truction; there is &s;carce a night but I hear of his di&s;orderly behaviour; do&s;t thou not think that the&s;e reports hurt me, who am the father of the young man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. &s;en.</SPEAKER>
<P>Parents often create them&s;elves unnece&s;&s;ary trouble by being too particular with their children&mdash;you multiply all the foibles of your &s;on into vices, and make no allowances for the &s;prightly &s;allies of youth; we will &s;ee which will turn out the clevere&s;t fellow, him or your primitive &s;on, whom you are bringing up in the &s;traight path.

<P>Would that George was like unto Jacob! What a con&s;olation would it be to my mind! It would be a healing comfort, bro|ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. &s;en.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I am &s;ure it would be mortifying to me if George was like unto, Ja|cob; I mean him for a different &s;phere in life, and tru&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e days he will make a fi|gure; I know him&mdash;the &s;eeds of greatne&s;s are planted in his brea&s;t, and time and reflection will make them blo&s;&s;om fair to the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Friend. &s;en.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great danger is, that the rank weeds of vice will overgrow the &s;eeds of virtue: thou ha&s;t been too indulgent to him; and where thou ha&s;t been mo&s;t to blame, was in making him too independent of thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, the&s;e are narrow, contrac|ted notions; it is de&s;troying every idea of
<PB N="15" REF="029129_0012_0FDFA8DD9B0A8BE0">
independence to have a per&s;on hanging on one, a wretched dependant; I have placed George in ea&s;y circum&s;tances: I know he will be grateful, and make u&s;e of his money like a gentleman; come let us go and &s;ee Hannah and Rachel.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>A &s;ly fellow, depend on't&mdash; Harry, methinks you look very brilliant; this has been a grand parade day&mdash;a fine &s;parkling hilted &s;word&mdash;now tell me truly is there not vanity in dangling that fine affair by your &s;ide?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, George, not a particle; but I feel a con&s;cious pride in wearing it, for
<PB N="16" REF="029129_0013_0FDFA8DFDA1ECC50">
the&s;e rea&s;ons:&mdash;it has been my tru&s;ty friend in the hour of danger; and the fir&s;t moment I gir|ded it on this &s;ide, I &s;ub&s;cribed my name to our glorious independence, which I will &s;upport while I have breath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a Don Quixote in po|litics! you were always an enthu&s;ia&s;t in that way, Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I glory in being an enthu&s;ia&s;t in the cau&s;e of liberty and my country; and e&s;teem it the mo&s;t fortunate circum&s;tance of my life, that I have been in&s;trumental in effecting a re|volution which has given freedom to millions living, and will &s;ecure it to millions yet unborn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>A political prophet, too&mdash;I hope you will not prove a fal&s;e one. Our national go|vernment has its enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a great many: it is the nature of a popular government, like ours, for party-&s;pirit to prevail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some will tell you it is the life and &s;oul of a republican government: it kept the lamp of liberty burning at Rome a long time, but, unfortunately, extingui&s;hed it at la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have nothing of that kind to fear among us: a great majority of the citi|zens of the united &s;tates are &s;ufficiently enlight|ened to judge for them&s;elves: they will not be led away or impo&s;ed upon by de&s;igning men of any de&s;cription whatever: they, I tru&s;t, &s;et a ju&s;t value upon one of the be&s;t con&s;titutions that ever was framed for the government of man. What people on earth, &s;ave our&s;elves, can boa&s;t of &s;o free and equal a repre&s;entation, or of choo&s;ing
<PB N="17" REF="029129_0014_0FDFA8E62F029778">
their chief magi&s;trate? What people under hea|ven enjoy civil and religious liberty with that pu|rity we do? With &s;uch advantages, and under &s;uch a government, how can we but be happy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no doubt but we are, and may continue to be the happie&s;t people on the face of the globe; but let us throw politics a&s;ide, and conver&s;e about the affairs of the world in general. Have you heard any thing that is wonderful through the day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a &s;entence: methinks the town &s;eems very dull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! dull indeed. Where have you concealed your&s;elf?&mdash;Here man&mdash;&s;ee what a volume of invitations I have: I am engaged to dinners, tea-parties, and balls, for the month to come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, really, Friendly, you are in great demand;&mdash;much in fa&s;hion among the belles; I wonder you don't &s;ingle out one from the fair flock for matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matrimony, eh!&mdash;no, no, Har|ry;&mdash;as the &s;ong goes,
<Q><L><STAGE>(Sings.)</STAGE>
I'll ki&s;s and hug,</L>
<L>And &s;hake a brogue,

<L>Like a merry, merry rogue,</L>

<P>No, no, Harry, hang me if I marry&mdash;unle&s;s I could have a thou&s;and wives.</P>

<P>What an extravagant rogue thou art! I &s;hould think my&s;elf &s;upremely ble&s;t with one.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha, honour indeed! do you talk of honour in love matters? Love is not to be re&s;tricted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, rational love may be; though your &s;i&s;ter is the dear and fir&s;t object of my affections, and one in whom all my earthly happine&s;s is centered, yet &s;uch are my no|tions of honour, that were &s;he to put her&s;elf under my protection, I think I could not ba&s;ely &s;teal her from her parents.</P>
</SP>

I &s;ee now the whole affair. Peevi&s;h has become jealous of his wife, without ju&s;t cau&s;e, I am &s;ure.

How am I to act in this affair? I mu&s;t write a penitent letter to Mrs. Peevi&s;h; but what the devil &s;hall I &s;ay to Peevi&s;h? I will go and beg his pardon for the di&s;honor intended him.
