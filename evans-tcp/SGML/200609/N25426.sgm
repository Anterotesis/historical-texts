<HEAD>THE FORTUNATE DISCOVERY: OR, THE HISTORY OF HENRY VILLARS.</HEAD>
<P>IN a remote village in the northern parts of the State of New-York, on the &s;ide of a river beautifully &s;haded with ancient oaks, around who&s;e branches the bellvine and honey-&s;uckle wan|tonly crept, &s;tood a &s;mall hou&s;e, or cot|tage, environed with hawthorn; beneath who&s;e foilage, the meandering rivulet &s;oftly &s;tole: Nature had made up the deficiency of Art, to render this little habitation truly delightful. At the com|mencement of the conte&s;t with Eng|land, Mr. Villars, with his amiable fa|mily,
<PB N="2" REF="033744_0004_0FF90881F8754AF8">
retired to this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot, to &s;hun the din of war; troubles in early life, had fixed a &s;ettled melancholly in his di&s;po&s;ition, that &s;uited be&s;t with retirement, particularly at this time, when the feeling heart mu&s;t be ever affected with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others. Mr. Villars was a Briton; but prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of America: and though he wi&s;hed to &s;ee her independent, he felt for his countrymen. Mrs. Villars was an amiable woman, and &s;till hand&s;ome; though trouble had greatly impaired her charms: her now darling employment, was forming the young mind of her daughter Loui&s;a, whom &s;he &s;aw daily improving; &s;he was now entering her &s;evententh year, and her beauty, though excelled by few, was her lea&s;t perfec|tion. Mr. Villars, equally employed his time with two fine boys, who&s;e good qualities promi&s;ed amply to repay his care; in this manner they had pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="3" REF="033744_0005_0FF908875A2BB8E8">
the three fir&s;t years of the war&mdash;and enjoyed a tranquillity, little known at tho&s;e times: when they were alarmed on hearing the enemy fa&s;t: approach|ing; and for many days, they heard frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes at a little di&s;tance. One evening Loui&s;a, accompanied by her younger brother Charles, was walk|ing on the banks of the river, the &s;un ju&s;t &s;inking below the horizon, the chanting of the birds, and the beauty of the evening, lulled her into a plea&s;ing reverie, and &s;he wandered &s;he knew not whither; nor did &s;he think of the im|propriety, till reminded by her brother of the di&s;tance they were from home; at that in&s;tant a beautiful little &s;paniel came up to them, and fawned on Loui&s;a, then whining, ran into an adjacent thick|et; &s;he immediately followed him, and perceived a young man on the ground, to all appearance dead; who by his dre&s;s appeared to be a Briti&s;h officer. Loui&s;a
<PB N="4" REF="033744_0006_0FF9088921961D30">
&s;hrieked, and was running away; when the humane little Charles &s;aid, "My dear &s;i&s;ter, perhaps the gentleman is not dead, and we may be of &s;ervice to him."</P>
<P>LOUISA, ever alive to the calls of humanity, &s;ummoned all her re&s;olu|tion, and advanced to the young man; holding &s;alts to his no&s;e, &s;he perceived him breathe. At this in&s;tant an officer arrived with &s;ome water in his hat; &s;eeing Loui&s;a (who was about to fly when &s;he perceived him.) He cried, "Ah, fair &s;tranger, art thou human, or an angel, &s;ent to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed?" She &s;topped, almo&s;t ready to faint with fright. Be not terrified, Madam, &s;aid he, "but tell me where I may carry my dying friend." She de&s;ired he would &s;tay with him, while &s;he ran for her father; &s;he flew home with the utmo&s;t precipitation; and acquainted Mr. Vil|lars,
<PB N="5" REF="033744_0007_0FF908901F5F4BB8">
he was ever happy to be of &s;er|vice to his fellow-creatures, waited not a moment; but went with his &s;ervants, had the gentleman brought home, and put to bed; a &s;urgeon was &s;ent for, who pronounced the wounds not mor|tal; but he had &s;uffered &s;o much from lo&s;s of blood, and want of timely a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, that the greate&s;t care was nece&s;|&s;ary. After his wounds had been dre&s;&s;ed &s;ome time, he opened his eyes; and &s;eeing his friend by his bed &s;ide, &s;aid, "Where am I, my dear Henry?" "Under the roof of ho&s;pitality," re|turned he, "Compo&s;e your&s;elf for the pre&s;ent, William, you &s;hall know all hereafter." "But to whom be&s;ides your|&s;elf am I obliged?" "Talk not to <HI>me</HI> of obligation" an&s;wered his friend, "Hea|ven has &s;ent an Angel in the form of a young lady, to our relief, and her be|nevolent father, has treated you as his child." During this conver&s;ation, Mr.

Villars, had retired to the other end of the room, perhaps he had his emotion. &mdash;He was extremely happy to have it in his power, to be of &s;ervice to the wounded gentleman; but there was &s;omething in the voice, and manners of his friend, that &s;truck him &s;o forcibly, he could not account for it; and his great re&s;emblance to a per&s;on we &s;hall hereafter mention, entirely ab&s;orbed him in thought; when the young gen|tleman came to him, and begged he would accept the thanks of his friend, who was now able to &s;peak to him. Mr. Villars approached the bed, and Cap|tain Bellmore (for that was his name) thanked him in the mo&s;t grateful terms for his extreme kindne&s;s; the good man told him, "to make him&s;elf as ea&s;y as his &s;ituation would permit, as his &s;peedy recovery, depended greatly on his being quite tranquil. "Alas, &s;ir" returned he, "I am perfectly ea&s;y on

my own account, but very unhappy on my friends. Mr. Hargrave has left his camp, in &s;earch of me; and I fear re|ports will be circulated, to the preju|dice of his honour." Mr. Villars &s;tarted at the thought, and turning to Mr. Hargrave, (who &s;at in a deep reverie) &s;aid, "Can I, &s;ir, be of &s;ervice to you?" this was pronounced with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, that Mr. Hargrave, before greatly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his favour, now felt an emotion, he could not con|quer; bowing very re&s;pectfully, he &s;aid, "His &s;ituation indeed required a friend:" &mdash;Mr. Villars told him it was late, and it was nece&s;&s;ary Captain Bellmore &s;hould re&s;t, begged him to join his wife and daughter in this little parlour; promi&s;ing Mr. Bellmore to do every thing in his power to &s;erve his friend, he wi&s;hed him a good night.&mdash;Mrs. Villars and Loui&s;a cho&s;e to receive Mr. Hargrave, and eagerly enquired after his friend. "He is much
<PB N="8" REF="033744_0010_0FF90899B61F1270">
better, Ladies," &s;aid he; and I hope, Madam (addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Loui&s;a) will in a &s;hort time be able to thank you as his guardian angel. Loui&s;a blu&s;hed; and only curt&s;ied. Mr. Villars then beg|ged Mr. Hargrave to inform them the manner of his friend's being wounded, and his leaving the camp.&mdash;"He told them, the day before they had had a &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h&mdash;that the party returned with an account of Captain Bellmore's being mi&s;&s;ing. A de&s;erter coming in &s;oon after, informed them he was lying on the field, he believed not quite dead. &mdash;I immediately applied for a flag, to go in &s;earch of him; but the orders was to march, and it could not be obtained. Our commanding officer was newly put in, or this would not have been the ca&s;e. &mdash;Di&s;gu&s;ted with the brutality of our colonel, and a heart bleeding for my friend, I took the advantage of the night, and left the camp in &s;earch of him&mdash;it
<PB N="9" REF="033744_0011_0FF9089F13E49720">
was near morning ere I found him. Alas! how can I de&s;cribe my feelings, on &s;eeing him in &s;uch a &s;ituation. I took him in my arms to a river not far di&s;|tant, wa&s;hed the blood from his face, and bound up his wounds with my hand|kerchief. After drinking a little water, he &s;eemed to recover: I &s;aw a light at a di&s;tance, and endeavoured to carry him to it; but I was deceived&mdash;it was only a vapour.</P>
<P>THE morn arrived, but with it no gleam of hope; I had wandered the whole day, &s;upporting my friend, I may &s;ay, carrying him; for he frequently fainted. I had at length brought him to the bank of the river, where Mi&s;s Villars found him. He had lo&s;t &s;o much blood, and was &s;o exhau&s;ted with endeavouring to travel, that I thought he would have expired. He begged me to leave him, and take care of my&s;elf.&mdash;
<PB N="10" REF="033744_0012_0FF908A3CDBF6CA8">
"My dear Harry," &s;aid he, "I feel I cannot live&mdash;why will you endanger your&s;elf&mdash;comfort my parents&mdash;farewell my friend."</P>
<P>I HAD not time to tell him, I would never leave him, when he again fainted. I ran for water to the river; when at my return, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, I beheld Mi&s;s Villars. Heaven had heard my prayer, and &s;ent relief when I had de|&s;paired of finding it."&mdash;Mr. Villars and the Ladies, highly commended Mr. Har|grave's humanity. The former &s;aid, "When things were properly repre|&s;ented, his leaving the camp would be deemed meritorious. He thought it would be dangerous to attempt return|ing. That as he was ever an enemy to di&s;&s;imulation, he would advi&s;e him to write to the general, and inform him of every circum&s;tance, and in the interim, to give him&s;elf up as a pri&s;oner of war;
<PB N="11" REF="033744_0013_0FF908A61F2E5490">
he made no doubt of his being very &s;oon exchanged."</P>
<P>THE young gentleman very politely thanked him for his advice, and &s;aid he would be entirely directed by him; then &s;eparated for the night; but not to &s;leep. Mr. and Mrs. Villars, though they &s;aw &s;omething in Mr. Hargrave that intere&s;ted them very much in his favour, they wi&s;hed to be more particularly acquainted with him. Mi&s;s Villars gentle heart was touched with compa&s;&s;ion: the &s;cene &s;he had been witne&s;s to, preyed &s;o forcibly on her &s;pirits, that &s;he could not &s;leep. At one moment, &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw Cap|tain Bellmore on the ground, ju&s;t ex|piring: at another, Hargrave dragged to pri&s;on as a &s;py. The next morning the &s;urgeon arrived; he &s;aid "Captain Bell|more was greatly recovered, and he hop|ed in no danger;" which gave univer|&s;al &s;atisfaction to this benevolent family.
<PB N="12" REF="033744_0014_0FF908AACB3A6B90">
Mr. Hargrave was &s;o rejoiced at his friend's recovery, that he forgot his own tuation, until reminded by Mr Villars; who propo&s;ed going with him to his commanding officer, who&s;e quarters was not above twenty miles di&s;tence. The bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;oon &s;ettled; Mr. Villars pro|cured for them leave of ab&s;ence, and they returned to the great &s;atisfaction of Captain Bellmore, who was much more anxi|ous for his friend than him&s;elf. After a few days, he was able to &s;it up; he begged Mr. Hargrave would intreat the Ladies permi&s;&s;ion for him to thank them in per&s;on, for the favours he had re|ceived: he complied with his reque&s;t. Mrs. Villars told him, &s;miling, "She was happy his friend was well enough to &s;ee company; that they would do them&s;elves the plea&s;ure of taking a di&s;h of tea with him that afternoon. &mdash;Loui&s;a appeared more lovely than u&s;ual; her dre&s;s, which was &s;implicity
<PB N="13" REF="033744_0015_0FF908AD19AC5F58">
it&s;elf, added to charms, already height|ened, by the heart-felt &s;atisfaction of having been &s;erviceable to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. &mdash;Mr. Villars attended the Ladies to the room, where Mr. Hargrave waited to receive them: he introduced Loui&s;a to his friend, "As the per&s;on they were &s;o much indebted to." At that moment, the little &s;paniel jumped on her lap, and licked her hands: Loui&s;a care&s;&s;ed him, and mentioned his coming to her on the bank of the river, and the ex|treme di&s;tre&s;s he &s;eemed in. It is need|le&s;s to relate the many obliging things that was &s;aid:&mdash;the afternoon pa&s;&s;ed away in a mo&s;t agreeable manner: they parted equally plea&s;ed with each other. Capt. Bellmore told the Ladies, that it would greatly add to his recovery, if they would favour him with their company often; which they promi&s;ing to do, wi&s;hed him a good evening.&mdash; "You are a happy fellow, Harry (&s;aid he,
<PB N="14" REF="033744_0016_0FF908AFF585FB08">
with a &s;igh,) to wait on this divine girl in all her little excur&s;ions."&mdash;He then launched out &s;o largely in Loui&s;a's prai&s;e, that his friend rallied him; telling him, "He believed the la&s;t wound he had re|ceived, would be the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate to cure:"&mdash;Upon my word, Will," con|tinued he, "I believe your ca&s;e is de&s;|perate&mdash;Mi&s;s Villars improves &s;o much on acquaintance, that I have little hopes of you.&mdash;"And do you really believe I am in love with Mi&s;s Villars?"&mdash;"Mo&s;t &s;in|cerely I do; for though I have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her the&s;e &s;ix days pa&s;t, and been indulged with her agree|able conver&s;ation, I have not thought half the fine things of her, that you have &s;aid within this quarter of an hour."&mdash;"Can it be po&s;&s;ible Mi&s;s Vil|lars has not charmed you? Is there any thing in her you can di&s;approve?" Do not mi&s;take me, my dear Will; &s;he is a mo&s;t de&s;erving girl. I have at
<PB N="15" REF="033744_0017_0FF908B493C83580">
this moment, a &s;incere affection for her, and would ri&s;k my life to &s;erve her; but love is quite out of the que&s;tion; &s;o you &s;ee I &s;hall be no rival&mdash;but upon my &s;oul, you mu&s;t not trifle with her." "Can you be &s;erious&mdash;do you think, &s;aid Captain Bellmore, "if it was, as you &s;uppo&s;e, I could be guilty of trifling with &s;uch a girl." "No, no, my friend," returned Hargrave, "I know your goodne&s;s of heart better: but I mu&s;t now bid you good night, and join the agreeable group in the par|lour, and &s;trive to find out in the languid blue eyes of the fair Loui&s;a, what effect your black ones have had." Saying this, he left him, and joined the family at &s;upper. Mr. Villars propo&s;ed, &s;ince company was &s;o agreeable to Cap|tain Bellmore, Mrs. Villars would take her work into his room the next day; and Loui&s;a &s;hould read for his amu&s;e|ment. (Loui&s;a blu&s;hed, &s;he knew not
<PB N="16" REF="033744_0018_0FF908BB4EBFB220">
why;) Mr. Hargrave politely thanked Mr. Villars for this mark of attention; they &s;oon after retired. Loui&s;a, not much inclined to &s;leep, &s;at down and wrote the following letter, to Mi&s;s Sommers:

<P>YOU have often, my dear Eliza, called me the reclu&s;e of the fore&s;t; and rallied me upon having no adven|tures to write.

<P>IN a &s;hort time, Captain Bellmore was able to leave his room; he would often read to the Ladies while they were at work. Mr. Hargrave's con|jectures were not wrong; the young Captain's thoughts were continually fixed on the fair Loui&s;a; he was never happy but in her company&mdash;when ab|&s;ent he was meditating whether he ought, and how he &s;hould, di&s;cover his &s;entiments; he viewed the many
<PB N="19" REF="033744_0021_0FF908CBD33D5E88">
bars to his happine&s;s&mdash;his family was noble, and of unbounded ambition; there was no probability of his father's con&s;enting to his union. He thought he &s;aw &s;omething in Mr. Villar's fa|mily, that pronounced them of a much higher rank than they at pre&s;ent mo|ved in; he wi&s;hed to be acquainted with their connections, but had not re&s;olution to break the &s;ubject: whe|ther they were, or were not, what they appeared to be, he had never har|boured a di&s;honourable thought. The anxiety of his mind, retarded his re|covery; and his friends were &s;orry to find he did not gain &s;trength as fa&s;t as they fir&s;t expected. "Advi&s;e me my Harry," &s;aid he to his friend, "I love the divine Loui&s;a, but would I not be a villain, to endeavour to gain her affections, when I am certain my fa|ther, (on whom you know I am entire|ly dependant,) will never con&s;ent to
<PB N="20" REF="033744_0022_0FF908CE24D52748">
my marrying her." "You are not &s;o &s;ure of that," returned his friend, "you can but a&s;k it; &s;hould it be refu&s;ed. and you are happy enough to be agree|able to Mi&s;s Villars, you are both young and can wait; you have great rea&s;on to expect promotion&mdash;as your father's intere&s;t can at any time procure you a regiment, you may then plea&s;e your|&s;elf." Mr. Hargrave, though he &s;poke in this manner, had not the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of Sir John Bellmore's con&s;ent|ing to his &s;on's union, but he wi&s;hed to encourage his hopes, as he feared the con&s;equence of his pre&s;ent unea&s;i|ne&s;s. One day, after a conver&s;ation of this kind, Capt. Bellmore went to walk in a wood adjoining the garden. Lou|i&s;a was &s;itting in an arbour of je&s;amine, care&s;&s;ing the favourite &s;paniel, when lifting up her eyes, &s;he &s;aw Capt. Bell|more approaching. "Happy Juba!" &s;aid he&mdash;at the &s;ame time, looking
<PB N="21" REF="033744_0023_0FF908D1D9F32488">
with uncommon tenderne&s;s at Mi&s;s Vil|lars, who had aro&s;e to retire as he en|tered the arbour; begged her pardon, &s;aid he would begone in a moment, if &s;he wi&s;hed to be alone." No indeed, I do not," &s;aid &s;he with an artle&s;s blu&s;h; at this he led her back to the &s;eat, and taking one of her hands, which he pre&s;&s;ed with ardour to his brea&s;t, "Will then my mo&s;t adored Mi&s;s Vil|lars, permit me a few moments con|ver&s;ation." Loui&s;a had &s;poke before &s;he thought, but it was now too late to rectify her mi&s;take, without appearing to under&s;tand him; &s;o carele&s;sly with|drew her hand, &s;he picked a &s;prig of je&s;&s;amine, and a&s;ked him, "If he did not think it would make a hand&s;omer wreath, than laurel?" He &s;aid he &s;hould not e&s;teem either, unle&s;s he could have the honour of laying them at her feet.&mdash;Poor Loui&s;a had unde&s;ign|edly led to the &s;ubject &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed

name, Captain Bellmore looked at his friend, and &s;miled. Mr. Villars a&s;ked what news Eliza had wrote from town. As Loui&s;a could not with propriety re|late the conver&s;ation at Mrs. Mu&s;h|room's; &s;he &s;aid, "nothing extraordinary, except the new conque&s;t &s;he has made of General <HI>Antique;</HI> who has with great formality, a&s;ked her Papa's permi&s;&s;ion to pay his addre&s;ses to her. Mr. V. laugh|ing, turned to the gentlemen, and &s;aid, "this young Lady is a beautiful girl of eighteen, and General <HI>Antique,</HI> an old veteran of &s;ixty at lea&s;t." Mr. Hargrave a&s;ked Loui&s;a, "if Mi&s;s Som|mers of New-York, was the Lady they mentioned." She an&s;wered, "She was, and a&s;ked him if he was acquainted with her."

After many obliging things &s;aid on both &s;ides, it was concluded, they &s;hould &s;et out in a fortnight.&mdash;Captain Bellmore had no opportunity of &s;peaking to Loui&s;a for &s;ome days;&mdash;when one evening, the gentlemen reque&s;ted her to walk&mdash;with her Mamma's permi&s;&s;ion, &s;he con&s;ented.

And continued he, "Charles and Edward will accompany me."&mdash; So &s;aying, he took the boys by the hand, and was out of &s;ight in an in|&s;tant.&mdash;The reader may be a&s;&s;ured the Captain did not lo&s;e the moments &s;o ardently wi&s;hed for; but plead his cau&s;e &s;o well, that had Loui&s;a acted from the dictates of her heart, he would have had no rea&s;on to com|plain.

They had &s;pent nigh an hour mo&s;t agreeably; when Har|grave and the little boys returned, with large bunches of flowers. After this, they had frequent interviews. Har|grave undertook to plead his friend's cau&s;e; but there was no occa&s;ion; he had an advocate in Loui&s;a's brea&s;t, more powerful than any he could offer. &mdash;Captain Bellmore, at length, obtained the promi&s;e he wi&s;hed.

<P>THE &s;cene was too affecting; they broke from each other.&mdash;When the little group a&s;&s;embled to breakfa&s;t, the concern was general; though the jour|ney had been twice retarded, it &s;till arrived too &s;oon, and they parted with mutual regret.&mdash;Mr. Villars accommo|dated them with <HI>hor&s;es</HI> to a town, about twenty miles di&s;tant, from whence they were to take the packet. Loui&s;a gave Mr. Hargrave the following let|ter for Mi&s;s Sommers:

An enemy to di&s;gui&s;e, I look on my&s;elf criminal, in placing my affections without the &s;anction of my parents. But alas! it is now too late.&mdash;I have not a heart to recall.

<P>NOTHING material happened on the road. The packet was ready to &s;ail when they arrived; they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ervant with the hor&s;es, and a few lines to Mr. Villars. The wind was fair, and in 6 days they arrived at New-York.&mdash;Mr. Villars had recommended them to his friend Colonel Rightly.&mdash; As &s;oon as they were dre&s;&s;ed, they waited on him; he immediately pro|vided them genteel lodgings, and in|vited them to dine with him the next

day.&mdash;Captain Bellmore begged, "he would recommend them to a merchant, as they had &s;ome bills they wi&s;hed to di&s;po&s;e of.&mdash;Colonel Rightly told them "he made no doubt, but Mr. Sommers would purcha&s;e, to whatever amount they cho&s;e."&mdash;And it was agreed, they &s;hould wait on him the next day.&mdash;Accordingly, Colonel Rightly called at twelve, and attended them to Mr. Sommers's, who immediately pur|cha&s;ed the bills, and politely invited them up &s;tairs; as they had mentioned having a letter for Mi&s;s Sommers.&mdash;She was &s;itting with her Mamma and &s;i&s;ter, when they entered. Mr. Sommers intro|duced them, &s;aying, "this gentleman has a letter for you, Eliza."&mdash;Mr. Hargrave approached; &s;he immediately recol|lected him, and blu&s;hing exceedingly, inquired after her friend's health.&mdash; Hargrave, though much confu&s;ed, an|&s;wered
<PB N="49" REF="033744_0051_0FF9092BB9338630">
her with a pretty good grace. The conver&s;ation then charged to the accident that brought them to Mr. Villars's hou&s;e;&mdash;they both expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t regard for the family, and their particular obligations.&mdash;After &s;tay|ing nigh an hour, they took their leave, Mr. Sommers politely reque&s;ted they would not be &s;trangers to his hou&s;e, while they remained in town.</P>
<P>Captain BELLMORE &s;oon made Mi&s;s Sommers (as the friend of Loui&s;a) his confident; and per&s;uaded her to en|clo&s;e his letters. The impre&s;&s;ion Eli|za's fine eye had made on Mr. Har|grave at fir&s;t &s;ight, was now deeply rooted; and he was never happy when ab&s;ent from her. Though extremely lively, &s;he had nothing of the coquette; &s;he preferred him to all her admirers, and did not &s;trive to conceal it. The Winter was now approaching, and
<PB N="50" REF="033744_0052_0FF9092E1F99BCA8">
there was no probability of being en|gaged in actual &s;ervice till &s;pring; nor did they &s;eem to wi&s;h it. Hargrave, happy with being near his Eliza, dread|ed nothing &s;o much as the thoughts of parting.&mdash;Captain Bellmore, though deprived of the &s;ight of Loui&s;a, had the plea&s;ure of hearing from her often. But we mu&s;t now leave them, and return to Loui&s;a; who &s;pent her time, as u&s;ual, in improvement with her ex|cellent Mother; but her tranquillity of mind was lo&s;t, her former amu&s;ement had now no charms.&mdash;She &s;eldom vi|&s;ited in the village, and whil&s;t the weather was fine, &s;he, often attended by her little Juba, &s;pent hours under the willow, which &s;he reverenced, as witne&s;s to her vows. Mr. and Mrs. Villars &s;aw the change in Loui&s;a; and &s;u&s;pected the cau&s;e, but did not think it &s;o deeply rooted. They, however, avoided mentioning, what they &s;aw

&s;he wi&s;hed to conceal &mdash;Nothing hap|pened during the fir&s;t part of the win|ter, worth relating. Through her friend, Loui&s;a received many letters from Captain Bellmore, which &s;he an&s;wered by the &s;ame means. We will now leave her, and return to town.</P>
<P>Mr. SOMMERS had one day invited Captain Bellmore and his friend to dine. Soon after they came in, Mr. Hargrave told Mr. Sommers, "He had letters from Lord Beauclair, which mentioned his drafts being paid, and hoped he had the &s;ame account." Mr. Sommers &s;aid he had.&mdash;At the name of Lord Beauclair, Eliza &s;tarted, and changed colour: In the evening, &s;he a&s;ked Mr. Hargrave if he was any re|lation to him. "A very di&s;tant one," replied he, "but he has been a father to me." "Pray," &s;aid Eliza, "is Lady Beauclair living." "She is," re|turned
<PB N="52" REF="033744_0054_0FF90933C61EBA08">
Hargrave, "but why, my dear Eliza, does the name of Lord Beau|clair &s;eem to affect you;" (for during this di&s;cour&s;e &s;he has often changed colour,) "I have heard," an&s;wered Eliza, "he had a daughter he u&s;ed very un|kindly, and I can't hear his name without emotion: do they know if &s;he is &s;till living." "They do not," replied he. "I have heard &s;he went &s;everal years ago to the Ea&s;t Indies, with her family; I have often heard Lady Beauclair la|ment her, but her name is never menti|oned before my Lord."&mdash;"Good God," &s;aid Eliza, "and her only fault, was marrying a worthy man with a &s;mall fortune."&mdash;"And is that a &s;mall fault, my beloved Eliza," &s;aid he, cla&s;ping her in his arms. "Tell me, I pray, if you know any thing of this Lady, or her family; for be a&s;&s;ured, though I have been taught to look on my&s;elf as the heir of Lord Beauclair, if ever

I am &s;o happy as to find Lady Maria, I &s;hall willingly re&s;ign my preten&s;ions in her favour." "Your intention is truly meritorious," returned Mi&s;s Sommers. "You may perhaps find Lady Maria, or &s;ome of her family:" "Ah! Mi&s;s Som|mers, &s;aid he, "riches or titles could only make me happy for being accep|table to you; and I am confident, you would not prize &s;uch unju&s;tly retained." &mdash;After a long and tender conver&s;ation, they parted equally plea&s;ed with each other.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s SOMMERS was torn between love and friend&s;hip; &s;he knew Lady Maria Beverly; but was not at liberty to di&s;cover her; and if &s;he did, &s;he would deprive the man &s;he mo&s;t regarded of im|mence riches; but friend&s;hip and ju&s;tice were predominant. She determined to write to her friend for permi&s;&s;ion to di&s;cover her, which &s;he immediately
<PB N="54" REF="033744_0056_0FF9094147791600">
did.&mdash;Mr. Hargrave related to Captain Bellmore the above conver&s;ation&mdash;they both concluded, Mi&s;s Sommers mu&s;t know &s;omething of Lady Maria; but thought it be&s;t not to pre&s;s her far|ther at pre&s;ent, as &s;he might not per|haps be at liberty to di&s;cover her. Not long after this, Mr. Hargrave attended Mi&s;s Sommers and her &s;i&s;ter, to &s;pend the evening at Mrs. Hardy's.&mdash;Doctor Squills by accident dropt in, he &s;aid he had ju&s;t come from the pri&s;on, and his feelings had not for a long time, been &s;o hurt. "A very decent woman was brought there &s;ome days before," continued he. "She is very ill, and I fear cannot live if &s;he is not removed to a more comfortable place:"&mdash;"pray what is &s;he charged with?" demanded Hargrave, "upon my word I cannot tell," returned the Doctor, "it &s;eems &s;he was taken within our line, and does not give a very good account of her&s;elf. She &s;ays

She has travelled from the Southward, in &s;earch of a young gentleman, &s;he was nur&s;e to, and whom &s;he heard was confined as a &s;py; I told her &s;he might be perfectly ea&s;y on that account, for no Briti&s;h officer was confined on &s;uch &s;u&s;picion at pre&s;ent." Mr. Hargrave a&s;ked him, "if he knew her name?" "I think it is Carely," an&s;wered the Doctor. "Good God!" exclaimed he, "my old nur&s;e." He begged the Ladies to ex|cu&s;e him, and &s;aid, he would wait on Colonel Rightly, and prevail upon him to u&s;e his intere&s;t, with regard to freeing Mrs Carely." He was no &s;oon|er gone, than &s;ome of the company expre&s;&s;ed great &s;urpri&s;e, at what they had heard.&mdash;Captain Bellmore, who had dropped in accidentally, briefly re|lated his being wounded, and the di&s;|intere&s;ted behaviour of Mr. Hargrave; which he &s;uppo&s;ed had given ri&s;e to the report that frightened poor Mrs.

Carely. The whole company joined in his prai&s;e; and Eliza had the inexpre&s;|&s;ible plea&s;ure of hearing the cho&s;en of her heart, extolled to the highe&s;t de|gree.</P>
<P>Mr. HARGRAVE went immediately to Col. Rightly, who promi&s;ed to do every thing in his power upon the occa&s;ion.&mdash; They went that night to the pri&s;on, though it was late. Hargrave entered the room, followed by the Colonel; they approached the bed&mdash;&s;he was &s;leeping. They had &s;tood a few moments, when &s;he awoke, praying for ble&s;&s;ings on her Harry.&mdash;"Your Harry is with you," &s;aid Hargrave, advancing.&mdash; The poor woman was nigh fainting.&mdash; "My &s;on," returned &s;he, "I &s;hall die ea&s;y, &s;ince I &s;ee you &s;afe."&mdash;"Compo&s;e your&s;elf, good mother, and tell me how you came here," replied Hargrave.&mdash; "O! &s;ir, I have not &s;trength;&mdash;I heard

<P>Col. RIGHTLY told her, "to make her|&s;elf ea&s;y&mdash;that he would procure her li|berty, and take her to his own hou&s;e." &mdash;The good woman thanked him with her tears; her heart was too full tor ut|terance. Next morning, Col. Rightly applied to the General, and had her brought home, where &s;he very &s;oon reco|vered; and took the place of a hou&s;e|keeper he had ju&s;t di&s;charged.&mdash;About this time, a peace was negociating; and ho&s;tilities cea&s;ed with Britain.</P>
<P>Mr. VILLARS&punc; who had adjourned go|ing to town (as he did not wi&s;h to leave his family at &s;uch a time) now paid a vi&s;it to the metropolis. His fir&s;t inquiries
<PB N="58" REF="033744_0060_0FF90952DA423AA0">
were for Capt. Bellmore and Mr. Har|grave, who received him with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction. They dined the next day at Mr. Sommers's, with Colonel Rightly and Major Beaucamp, who was al&s;o a Bri|ti&s;h officer on leave of ab&s;ence. The company had a&s;&s;embled &s;ome time before the Major came in. Mr. Sommers in|troduced him. As he approached Mr. Villars, he &s;tarted and &s;topped. "Ex|cu&s;e me, &s;ir&mdash;your likene&s;s is &s;o great to a friend of mine, that was I not almo&s;t certain of his death, I &s;hould think I now &s;aw him before me.&mdash; "You are not mi&s;taken, my friend," &s;aid Mr. Villars, his eyes &s;wimming in tears; "and can I be &s;o happy," re|plied the Major, pre&s;&s;ing him to his brea&s;t, "Again to meet my Beverly!&mdash; You &s;ee indeed the man who once was Beverly," returned Mr. Villars; "but, ah! the trials I have met &s;ince la&s;t we parted!"&mdash;The reader may ea&s;ily ima|gine

the a&s;toni&s;hment of Mr. Hargrave and Captain Bellemore, at the above conver&s;ation:&mdash;the former would im|mediately have gone to Mr. Villars's, and di&s;covered his intentions in his favour; but Mi&s;s Sommers detained him. "Con&s;ider," &s;aid &s;he, "you are dependent on Lord Beauclair; and &s;hould you di&s;oblige him, by interfer|ring in this matter, you may be de|prived of his favour, and not have it in your power to &s;erve them. You will, no doubt, hear Mr. Villars's &s;tory; you may then mention your connec|tions with Lord Beauclair, and your intentions, &s;hould the e&s;tate come in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion:"&mdash;"You are extremely right, my dear Eliza," an&s;wered he: "I can at pre&s;ent do nothing; but I feel exceedingly intere&s;ted in their be|half." In the mean time, Major Beau|camp was a&s;king Mr. Villars many que&s;|tions, as he had not &s;een him &s;ince his

Mr. Sommers &s;aid, "He hoped the long friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween Mr. Villars and him&s;elf, would ex|cu&s;e his begging to hear his &s;tory, <NOTE PLACE="foot">Mi&s;s Sommers was the only per&s;on pre&s;ent, acquainted with Mrs. Villars's &s;tory, which Loui&s;a had related to her in confidence.</NOTE> which he thought would be very intere&s;ting." "My hi&s;tory is a melancholly one," re|turned he, "and I believe will afford lit|tle &s;atisfaction; though notwith&s;tanding I'll endeavour to recollect facts, that will tear open wounds, time can never heal. Accordingly, as &s;oon as the cloth was removed, Mr. Villars began as follows:</P>
<P>MY father was the younge&s;t &s;on of an ancient family in Cumberland, of the name of Villars. My grandfather, at an advanced age, married a widow of &s;mall fortune; &s;he had one daugh|ter, who was very beautiful; and her mother po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great deal of art,
<PB N="61" REF="033744_0063_0FF9095A15C26B58">
&s;oon made a match between her and my father's elder brother. She had great a&s;cendancy over my grandfather, and found means to withdraw his af|fection from his younger children.&mdash; My father, and a &s;i&s;ter of twelve years of age, were &s;ent to a boarding-&s;chool, and never allowed to come home. At my grandfather's death, they found them&s;elves thrown on the world, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very few hundreds.&mdash; Mi&s;s Villars took her father's u&s;age &s;o much to heart, that &s;he died not long after. &mdash;She was in her eighteenth year when this melancholly event took place. My father, who was of a lively turn, &s;ubmitted to the caprice of fortune, and &s;trove to be content: he had &s;tu|died the law, but did not pay &s;uch &s;trict attention to it, as he ought.&mdash; When he had entered his two and twen|tieth year, a brother of my grandfather's mother died, and left my father an

e&s;tate nigh Bath, of &s;ix hundred pounds a year; with which he was to take the name of Beverly. He &s;oon after mar|ried Mi&s;s Loui&s;a Herbert, a very ac|compli&s;hed young Lady, with a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>A YEAR after their marriage, I was born; and in two years more, they received a &s;econd addition to their hap|pine&s;s, by the birth of a daughter.&mdash; Nothing material happened during our minority, until I attained my nineteenth year. My father paid the greate&s;t at|tention to our education, (but impru|dently lived to the extent of his income.) My mother often remon&s;trated to lit|tle purpo&s;e; he was not of a di&s;po&s;ition to brook re&s;traint.</P>
<P>AT that age, I left the univer&s;ity; my father intended me for the army, but my mother would never con&s;ent
<PB N="63" REF="033744_0065_0FF9095ED976E3F0">
to it; and was with difficulty prevailed on, to con&s;ent to my making the tour of France and Italy, the en&s;uing year; which I did, accompanied by my friend Beaucamp, and his worthy father; who acted as governor to us both.&mdash; Whil&s;t abroad, I became acquainted with Lord Sidly, &s;on to the Earl of Beauclair. He was plea&s;ed to profe&s;s the greate&s;t friend&s;hip for me; indeed it was amply returned;&mdash;and I &s;hall ever &s;incerely regret his lo&s;s."</P>
<P>Mr. VILLARS &s;topped and wiped his eyes. We &s;tayed," continued he, "two years abroad, and returned to|gether.&mdash;My father was cho&s;en as a member for a neighbouring borough; and the winter after I returned, I ac|companied him to town; my fir&s;t enquiries were for Lord Sidly. He received me with great cordiality, and introduced me to Lady Beauclair, the

Hon. Charles Sidly, and Lady Maria, his &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;I was great part of my time with Lord Sidly; and had frequent opportunities of &s;eeing Lady Maria.&mdash; I was admitted to all their parties;&mdash; the friendly and familiar footing, I was on in the family, (for even Lord Beauclair &s;eemed particularly attentive to me) made me forget the difference of rank; and my heart a&s;pired to this lovely girl.&mdash;I &s;ometimes fancied my&s;elf not indifferent to her; but I &s;till en|deavoured to conceal my own &s;enti|ments, in company with her brother.</P>
<P>I ONE night attended her to the play; there happened to be a riot&mdash; Lady Maria was extremely frightened; and we were making our way through the croud, with an intention to get out, when a man rudely caught her arm. This way Ma'am," &s;aid he. Throw|ing her&s;elf in my arms, "Oh! &s;ave me,

Beverly," exclaimed &s;he. I took her up, and bore her to the carriage, in which I placed her almo&s;t fainting. I &s;eated my&s;elf by her, and ordered the carriage to drive home. Lady Maria a&s;ked for her brother; I told her, "We had left him at the theatre; but if &s;he wi&s;hed, I would return, and &s;eek him."&mdash;" O, no!" &s;aid &s;he, " do not leave me."&mdash;I pre&s;&s;ing her hand to my heart, told her, I would wi&s;h never to leave her;&mdash;her head was &s;till reclined on my &s;houlder.&mdash;At the&s;e words &s;he &s;ighed, and &s;tarting, with|drew the hand I pre&s;&s;ed, &s;aying, "Excu&s;e me, Mr. Beverly, I have been exceedingly frightened." The coach now &s;topped, and I attended her to the parlour. Lady Beauclair a&s;ked, "why they came home &s;o &s;oon, and what had become of Lord Sidly." I related what had hap|pened. "I have cau&s;ed a great deal of trouble to Mr. Beverly," &s;aid Lady

Maria; "he was &s;o good as to carry me a con&s;iderable di&s;tance in his arms." I could only an&s;wer her by a look, which I thought &s;he under&s;tood. The day fol|lowing, the Hon. Charles Sidly &s;et out on his travels. His departure afforded mutual concern, as he was to take the tour of Europe; and he was not ex|pected to return in &s;ome years.</P>
<P>SOON after this, I returned home, I corre&s;ponded with Lord Sidly, but dared not mention my beloved Maria, agreeable to the dictates of my heart. When the bathing &s;ea&s;on came on, he wrote me, that he &s;hould &s;oon wait on Lady Maria to Bath, as &s;he was in ill health, and begged me to pro|cure him lodgings; which I immedi|ately did, and waited with impatience, for their arrival. It was not long before I received a card with the welcome intelligence. I flew to their lodgings, Lord
<PB N="67" REF="033744_0069_0FF9096DABC857F0">
Sidly met me on the &s;tairs, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t happine&s;s at &s;eeing me. Lady Maria aro&s;e as I entered; &s;he looked very pale and languid: I begged her to be &s;eated, and told her, "I was grieved to owe the happine&s;s of &s;eeing her to ill health." Lord Sidly &s;oon left the room;&mdash;I was thrown from my guard, and &s;aid &s;ome|thing of a more tender nature, than I had ever dared before: &s;he &s;eemed much affected, but I thought not di&s;|plea&s;ed.&mdash;In the evening, I attended my &s;i&s;ter Caroline to her lodgings.&mdash; They were equally plea&s;ed with each other; and the next day we went to the rooms. The Ladies preferred walking home; as it was but a very &s;hort di&s;tance, Lord Sidly gave his arm to Caroline, and I offered mine to Lady Maria. We had not proceed|ed far, when &s;he &s;aid, " you know not how unhappy I have been, Mr.
<PB N="68" REF="033744_0070_0FF9097274D5FC58">
Beverly, &s;ince you left us." She then told me, "that her Papa had en|couraged the addre&s;&s;es of Lord Win|ters; whom I knew was very di&s;a|greeable to her: that he had given her po&s;itive orders to prepare to marry him.&mdash;And had it not been for the interce&s;&s;ion of her brother, who had prevailed on him to allow her a little time, &s;he &s;hould e're this have been dragged to the altar." She &s;aid, "&s;he would rather die, than marry that de&s;erted Lord, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he would be obliged to do when &s;he re|turned." This was like fire to my brain; though I had no right to hope. Yet to &s;ee her &s;acrificed to a &s;uper|annuated wretch, who had nothing to recommend him but immen&s;e riches&punc; was more than I could bear, when pre&s;&s;ing the hand I held to my bo&s;om, "My beloved Maria,"&mdash;cried I, "this cannot, this mu&s;t not be."&mdash;She &s;ighed,
<PB N="69" REF="033744_0071_0FF9097807FD16F8">
but made no reply. We had now reached the hou&s;e: Lord Sidly in&s;i&s;ted upon our &s;pending the day with them. &mdash;My father waited on him the next day, and invited them to dine; they accepted the invitation. That and many more days, we &s;pent together. I was no longer ma&s;ter of my&s;elf: I declared my &s;entiments without re&s;erve, and pathetically lamented my hard fortune; I had the plea&s;ure to find &s;he was not di&s;plea&s;ed: But would &s;ay, "O!

<P>THUS we had &s;pent &s;ix weeks, when one evening at an a&s;&s;embly, we were ac|co&s;ted by Lord Winter: he told Lady Maria, "He had ju&s;t arrived from town; and as he did not know where &s;he lodged, he expected to have the plea-of meeting her there:" and very care|le&s;sly
<PB N="70" REF="033744_0072_0FF90979B1049968">
begged her to go down the next dance with him. She an&s;wered, "&s;he &s;hould dance but little, and was engag|ed;" "who is the happy per&s;on that u&s;urps my right," &s;aid he, indignantly. "Very well my Lady, perhaps I may not be allowed to wait of you home nei|ther?"&mdash;"Very probable, my Lord," replied &s;he. At that moment, the dance was called.&mdash;as I advanced, &s;he aro&s;e and gave me her hand; &s;he trembled &s;o exceedingly, &s;he could &s;carcely move. When the dance was over, &s;eeing her very much flurried, I led her to a &s;eat, and called her brother and Caroline to her. I told Lord Sidly, the &s;ight of Lord Winter had affected her &s;o much, &s;he was near fainting."&mdash; "Lord Winter here!" &s;aid he: "Damn him, he'll be the death of the girl yet."</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the evening, Lord Winter had learnt, "I was the only
<PB N="71" REF="033744_0073_0FF9097F175B81E8">
one that had attended Lady Maria &s;ince her arrival at Bath: that &s;he &s;pent the greate&s;t part of her time at our hou&s;e; in &s;hort, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, I was her favoured admirer. He advanced, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her, a&s;ked "if he &s;hould order his chariot."&mdash; She thanked him; but &s;aid, "&s;he &s;hould return with her brother;&mdash;Lord Sidly gave him a card, and begged the fa|vour of his company to dine the next day: he returned a &s;light bow, and retired to a little di&s;tance, where he could ob&s;erve who went into the car|riage.&mdash;I led Lady Maria to the door; when Lord Sidly &s;aid, "Beverly, I mu&s;t &s;ee you to-morrow morning."&mdash; I went accordingly, and learnt Lady Maria had been &s;o ill all night, &s;he was not able to come down to breakfa&s;t. "I cannot conceive," &s;aid Lord S. "why my father in&s;i&s;ts on &s;acrificing the girl for riches."&mdash;" Oh! my Lord," cried
<PB N="72" REF="033744_0074_0FF90980B5C18D08">
I, "Do you know no way to &s;ave her?"&mdash;He &s;aw my emotion, but tak|ing no notice of it, &s;aid, "what can I do for her? can't you advi&s;e me?"&mdash; "I could, but"&mdash;"but what," &s;aid he, &s;miling, "I &s;uppo&s;e you would advi&s;e me to get &s;ome clever fellow to take her out of his way."&mdash;My Lord," &s;aid I, &s;tarting, "Be not ama|zed, would not you like to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in preventing this match?"&mdash;" I would willingly lo&s;e my life, to contribute to her felicity." "But if I'm not mi&s;|taken, you mu&s;t pre&s;erve your life, to make her happy." "Henry," continued he, "I will trifle no longer. I have long &s;een the affection between you and Ma|ria; and with my parent's con&s;ent, no man on earth I would as &s;oon call bro|ther&mdash;but as it is, I can't bear to &s;ee her wretched. I am &s;en&s;ible the blame will fall on me, but I am better able to bear it."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="033744_0075_0FF90983C91E9840">I know not what I &s;aid to him; my ex|tacy may more ea&s;ily be imagined than defined. I would have fell at his feet, and embraced his knees; but preventing me, he &s;aid, "if I acted like &s;uch a crazy fellow, he would not tru&s;t his &s;i&s;|ter with me."&mdash;He then left me, to go to her, with whom he &s;oon returned; and leading her to the &s;ofa, &s;aid, Beverly, Maria is quite &s;hagrined at Lord Winter's not calling on her this morning; and I have recommended an hour's conver&s;a|tion with you, to recover her &s;pirits. So &s;aying, he &s;miled and left us. "Bro|ther!" exclaimed &s;he, with &s;urpri&s;e: I flew to her, and folding her in my arms, told her what had pa&s;&s;ed between Lord Sidly and my&s;elf. We now gave a loo&s;e to the mo&s;t endearing &s;en&s;ations, and for a time forgot the many bars to our union.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="033744_0076_0FF90986CC0D6360">WE had been nigh two hours together, when Lord Sidly returned; he &s;eemed thoughtful, and walked the room &s;ome time without &s;peaking; then turning to us, he &s;aid Lord Winter had left Bath; that he had made particular enquries con|cerning me, and was heard to &s;ay, "Lord Beauclair &s;hould be acquainted with his children's behaviour." "What is to be done, Beverly ?" continued he.&mdash; I told him, "I thought no time was to be lo&s;t; and begged him to let us &s;et out immediately for Scotland."</P>
<P>IT was accordingly determined, we &s;hould be off at four that afternoon. To prevent &s;u&s;picion, we were to go the fir&s;t &s;tage in Lord Sidly's cha|riot; he had &s;ent a tru&s;ty &s;ervant on, to provide a po&s;t-chai&s;e. Lord Sidly and my &s;i&s;ter were the only per|&s;ons in the &s;ecret; I took all the mo|ney I had by me, which amounted
<PB N="75" REF="033744_0077_0FF90988650FABC0">
to two hundred guineas.&mdash;I left a letter for my father, which I told Caroline not to give him, until the next evening, as we &s;hould by that time be out of reach.</P>
<P>LORD Sidly, at parting, put a bank-note of fifteen hundred pounds in Maria's hand; &s;he was very much affected, and &s;aid, "O, my brother! what will you not &s;uffer on my account." "If you are happy, my dear girl, I &s;hall be amply re|paid." About nine miles from Bath, we took a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and Lord Sidly's carriage returned: hone&s;t John had pro|vided relays at every &s;tage, &s;o that we were not obliged to wait a moment. We had travelled all night, but the next day, poor Maria was &s;o fatigued, we were o|bliged to re&s;t &s;ome hours. We arrived without any accident. Maria bore the journey much better than I had expected &s;he would. We were immediately mar|ried,
<PB N="76" REF="033744_0078_0FF9098AB0A8AE28">
and took lodgings, as I thought it be&s;t not to return directly.</P>
<P>THE report of our being eloped, did not &s;pread in Bath, until the af|ternoon following our departure.&mdash; My father was extremely enraged; his proud &s;pirit could not brook my being de&s;pi&s;ed, as he was certain I &s;hould be by Lord Beauclair's family; and he made no doubt, but his lord&s;hip would u&s;e all his intere&s;t to effect his ruin. (which was indeed the ca&s;e.)</P>
<P>LORD Winter had no &s;ooner arrived in town, than he waited on Lord Beauclair, and told him, it was currently reported, that lady Maria received the addre&s;&s;es of Mr. Beverly, and Lord Sidley encoura|ged it. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the rage of his lord&s;hip, on this information: he di&s;patched a &s;ervant to his &s;on with orders to return immediately, without
<PB N="77" REF="033744_0079_0FF9098D061F4A90">
mentioning the cau&s;e&mdash;before he receiv|ed the letter, the news of our elopement and marriage, had reached town;&mdash;Lord Beauclair's rage was now beyond all bounds;&mdash;he wrote to my father in the mo&s;t opprobrious manner; and al&s;o to Lord Sidley, in which he forbid him ever to appear in his pre&s;ence; that he forever renounced Maria; and was determined never to hear any interpo&s;ition in favour of either of them.</P>
<P>LORD Sidly was extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on reading his father's letter; he did not think he would have carried his re&s;ent|ment to &s;uch lengths.&mdash;He immediately &s;et out for London. Upon his arrival, he went directly to his father's: when a &s;ervant &s;aid, he had orders to tell him he had no home there.&mdash;He took lodgings nigh, and wrote to his mother in the mo&s;t affecting manner.&mdash;After writing a third letter, he received an an&s;wer, by
<PB N="78" REF="033744_0080_0FF9098F53DBC168">
Su&s;an Artle&s;s, Lady Maria's maid.&mdash; This was much colder than he expected from her. She informed him, Lord Beauclair was determined not to &s;ee him: and begged he would never men|tion her di&s;obedient daughter to her; that Su&s;an &s;hould be ordered to pack up her clothes and jewels, which &s;hould be &s;ent to her; and de&s;ired him to let her know, it was all &s;he had to expect. Poor Su&s;an wept bitterly, and begged &s;he might go to her mi&s;tre&s;s, which &s;he &s;oon after did.</P>
<P>THO' Lord Sidly had only &s;even hun|dred pounds a year, independent of his fa|ther, he was determined never again to &s;eek his favour; but immediately pur|cha&s;ed a majority in a marching regi|ment, de&s;tined for the Ea&s;t Indies&mdash;from whence he never returned.</P>
<P>HERE Mr. Villars &s;topped, from an
<PB N="79" REF="033744_0081_0FF90991A41240C0">
incapability of proceeding. &mdash; He after &s;ome time thus continued: "Some weeks after our marriage, Su&s;an arrived with my wife's trunks, and a letter from Lord Sidly; he mentioned his going to India, but &s;aid he would pay us a vi&s;it before he &s;ailed.&mdash;Maria, and I, had both wrote to Lord Beauclair; and our letters had been returned unopened; &s;he could bear with greater fortitude, their cruelty to her&s;elf, than to her brother; it mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected us, that he &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o much for us, he &s;pent a fortnight with us before he &s;ailed, and &s;eemed prefectly chearful.&mdash;He told my wife to be intirely ea&s;y, on his account, that leaving her happy, would be a great means of making him &s;o. Soon after he left us, we received a letter from him, in which he impower|ed me to draw upon his banker for two hundred a year, until his return.</P>
<P>MY wife di&s;po&s;ed of her jewels; the
<PB N="80" REF="033744_0082_0FF909964D642960">
&s;ale of which amounted to fourteen hun|dred pounds; this we added to the pre|&s;ent Lord Sidly had &s;o generou&s;ly made his &s;i&s;ter, and purcha&s;ed a &s;mall e&s;tate in my father's neighbourhood. But, alas! a cloud was now hanging over our heads, which bur&s;t with all its force.</P>
<P>MY father had been obliged to mort|gage his e&s;tate for &s;everal hundreds. Lord Beauclair bought the mortgage, and immediately clo&s;ed it; this heightened my father's re&s;entment again&s;t me; he had never been perfectly reconciled; he &s;aid, he was convinced I &s;hould be his ruin.&mdash;My wife propo&s;ed mortgaging our e&s;tate, to clear his, but he would not accept of it. His was accordingly &s;old for much le&s;s than the value.&mdash;My &s;i&s;|ter was ju&s;t married to Colonel Mont|gomery, and went with him to Scotland. Had my father been prudent, he &s;till
<PB N="81" REF="033744_0083_0FF8C320C1205480">
had &s;ufficient to live comfortably; but his &s;pirit was too great to retrench.</P>
<P>AFTER his affairs were &s;ettled, there were &s;even thou&s;and pounds remaining, which he placed in the hands of an eminent broker: took a hou&s;e in Bath; and lived as u&s;ual.&mdash;A year after our marriage, my Maria pre&s;ented me with a &s;on, whom we named Henry, after Lord Sidley.</P>
<P>HERE Mr. Villars cea&s;ed&mdash;the tears flowed &s;o fa&s;t, he was obliged to leave the room; in a &s;hort time he return|ed, and thus continued: "When my &s;on was about &s;ix months old, Lord and Lady Beauclair came to Bath. One day Lady Beauclair &s;aw the nur&s;e and child walking before my father's door, (for though very much incen&s;ed with me, &s;he was fond of my child, and would often &s;end for him.)&mdash;She &s;top|ped,
<PB N="82" REF="033744_0084_0FF8C32D849D6968">
and a&s;ked who&s;e child it was: when &s;he was told, &s;he &s;tarted and walked on; then returning, told the nur&s;e to &s;tep into a milliner's &s;hop with her; &s;he care&s;&s;ed the infant. "It is a &s;weet boy," &s;aid &s;he. She then took a gold medal, and tied it by a ribbon, round the child's neck: the nur&s;e a&s;ked if &s;he &s;hould tell Mrs. Beverly to whom &s;he was obliged." She an&s;wered, "it was not material."&mdash;When the nur&s;e came home, &s;he acquainted my wife with the rencoun|ter.&mdash;My poor Maria was near fainting; &s;he knew the medal, and found her Mo|ther was &s;till determined not to &s;ee her. &mdash;She, however, re&s;olved again to write, but they left Bath the next day.</P>
<P>MY father's affairs now became de&s;pe|rate&mdash;his creditors pre&s;&s;ed upon him, and we determined to mortgage our e&s;tate, and &s;end him relief, as from an unknown hand. We rai&s;ed eight hundred pounds,
<PB N="83" REF="033744_0085_0FF90997E7D3EC40">
which we &s;ent, enclo&s;ed in a blank pa|per. But, alas! we were only involving our&s;elves, without doing him any &s;er|vice. His debts were to a much greater amount than we were worth, and I &s;aw him dragged to the pri&s;on without the power to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>I applied to &s;everal of his friends in town, but Lord Beauclair had prejudiced them again&s;t him. He &s;uffered but a few months&mdash;he was &s;eized with a fever, that carried him off within, a few weeks.</P>
<P>HOW can I expre&s;s my feelings?&mdash;I looked upon my&s;elf as acce&s;&s;ary to his misfortune. The creditors took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of every thing: my poor mother &s;uf|fered in &s;ilence, and never reproached me; &s;he &s;oon went to Scotland to my &s;i&s;ter, as Col. Montgomery had pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;pend the remainder of her days with them. She was &s;carcely gone, when
<PB N="84" REF="033744_0086_0FF9099BACC9BE78">
Mr. Granville, the gentleman from whom we borrowed the money, demanded im|mediate payment. Lord Beauclair would not appear in this; but I have been &s;ince informed, he per&s;uaded Mr. Granville to act in the manner he did.</P>
<P>I WAS now obliged to apply to a broker, and to give an exorbitant inte|re&s;t. It is needle&s;s to mention the many misfortunes that attended me, in the cour&s;e of two years; I was obliged to &s;ell my e&s;tate. I had now one thou&s;and pounds left; with which I &s;till continued in trade, with a merchant in Bri&s;tol. Our whole &s;tock was now embarked in one bottom, and the fate of that was un|certain; troubles &s;eemed to thicken upon us; anxiety for my family (for I had now two children) entirely depre&s;&s;ed my &s;pirits: but fortune had &s;till greater evils in &s;tore; we had been but three years married, when we received accounts of
<PB N="85" REF="033744_0087_0FF9099D86FE5FF0">
Lord Sidly's death: this &s;troke was almo&s;t too much for my poor Maria; but hea|ven &s;upported her through it. He had left a will with her, which we opened, and found he had made her his heir: I commi&s;&s;ioned a gentleman to wait on Lord Beauclair with a copy of the will; his Lord&s;hip flew in a violent rage, &s;aid that "Lord Henry had been very impru|dent, to allow us any thing while he was abroad; that the will was a vile forgery, and I &s;hould &s;uffer for it." He was in|deed as good as his word; for three days after, I received his an&s;wer; I was arre&s;t|ed for forgery.</P>
<P>I WILL not pretend to figure my a&s;ton|i&s;hment, or my dear Maria's di&s;tre&s;s; we did not imagine, notwith&s;tanding Lord Beauclair's threats, that he would have gone &s;uch lengths. The unfeeling bailiff pulled my wife, who was ju&s;t &s;inking in|to my arms, from me, and inhumanly
<PB N="86" REF="033744_0088_0FF909A01102FEE8">
dragged me away.&mdash;Great God! &s;hall I ever forget this &s;cene, or the cries of my little Henry, who was not three years old." Here Mr. Villars was obliged to &s;top for &s;ome time, and then went on as follows:</P>
<P>"I begged the bailiff to be patient: that I was certain I could obtain bail." &mdash;He &s;aid, "he had orders to admit of none."&mdash;We then proceeded to a clo&s;e uncomfortable goal, where I was inform|ed I was to remain until I had my trial.&mdash;Mr. Traffic (the gentleman with whom I had commenced bu&s;ine&s;s,) be|haved with the greate&s;t friend&s;hip, and undertook to have the will proved; but unfortunately for us, Sir William Harly, one of the witne&s;&s;es, was in India; and the other, a Mr. Scrip, an attorney, im|mediately ab&s;conded; we made the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch for him, but to no pur|po&s;e; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed he was well paid for his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="033744_0089_0FF909A261CDCF00">MY wife wrote a mo&s;t pathetic letter to her mother, and received for an an|&s;wer, "That it was entirely out of her power to do any thing for her, unle&s;s &s;he would con&s;ent to part from me; on tho&s;e conditions &s;he &s;hould be rein&s;tated in their favour; that &s;he would take her &s;on un|der their own particular care; and I &s;hould be relea&s;ed, on promi&s;ing to quit the country immediately, and never return; and that &s;he &s;hould have a month to con|&s;ider of it."</P>
<P>THIS was &s;ent by a &s;ervant of Lord Beauclair's, who told Maria, he believed his mi&s;tre&s;s was compelled to write as &s;he did; for &s;he wept very much when &s;he gave him the letter. Maria an&s;wered it immediately; &s;he &s;aid it required no time to con&s;ider; that though &s;he was deter|mined to live and die with me, and tru&s;ted to a ju&s;t God, who knew my innocence, to &s;ee me righted;&mdash;to be reconciled to

her mother, was her mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h; but was grieved, it could not be accom|pli&s;hed but on terms &s;he never would con|&s;ent to.</P>
<P>I had remained &s;ix months in goal, during which time, Mr. Traffic had re|ceived accounts of our ve&s;&s;el having made a lo&s;ing voyage. My wife took a lodg|ing contiguous to the goal, and di&s;charged the few &s;ervants we kept, except my &s;on's nur&s;e, who&s;e hu&s;band and child were both dead; and her attachment to my &s;on was &s;o great, &s;he &s;aid &s;he would never leave us.</P>
<P>MY wife had one day, brought the children to &s;ee me; I was care&s;&s;ing them whil&s;t &s;he leaned over me, the tears flow|ing fa&s;t down her cheeks, when the door opened, and the Hon. Charles Sidly, (now Lord Sidly, who we had not heard was returned) entered. Though he had
<PB N="89" REF="033744_0091_0FF909A7350F9670">
not &s;o much tenderne&s;s in his di&s;po&s;ition, as his brother, he could not behold this &s;cene unaffected. He tenderly embraced his &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid "he was grieved to &s;ee us thus; and mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;hed the affair could be cleared up." He &s;aid that Lord Beauclair, had been more exa&s;pe|rated again&s;t us &s;ince Lord Sidly's death, knowing that his unkindne&s;s to him, which drove him abroad, was en|tirely owing to us:" He begged we would keep up our &s;pirits; he did not in the lea&s;t doubt the authenticity of the will, (which we had &s;hewn him) and hoped we might have it in our power to prove it.&mdash;He &s;eemed much amazed, when we informed him of Mr. Scrip's &s;udden di&s;appearance. At parting, he put a note of five hundred pounds in Maria's hand, and &s;aid he would &s;ee us again &s;hortly.</P>
<P>I NOW &s;et about &s;ettling my affairs,
<PB N="90" REF="033744_0092_0FF909ABDBD95560">
as I was re&s;olved to leave England, as &s;oon as I could procure my liberty.&mdash; At the end of three weeks, Lord Sidly arrived, with an order for my enlarge|ment. He &s;aid he was &s;orry to own, his father &s;eemed unrea&s;onably incen&s;ed again&s;t us; and he would advi&s;e me to leave England;&mdash;at lea&s;t for a time. That I might depend upon his intere&s;t, though he did not dare openly to e&s;|pou&s;e my cau&s;e.&mdash;I told him, it was our intention, as I had no wi&s;h to &s;tay in a place, in which I had experienced &s;o ma|ny rubs from fortune.&mdash;He then gave me a note for &pound;. 400, and told me I might every year draw upon him for the like &s;um, through Mr. Traffic; and if ever the will could be proved, he &s;hould with plea&s;ure re&s;ign the e&s;tate his brother left us.</P>
<P>WE now prepared for our departure; we took our pa&s;&s;age in a &s;hip ready to &s;ail
<PB N="91" REF="033744_0093_0FF909AD74E7F9D0">
for India. Mr. Traffic gave me letters to his friends in Madeira, as the ve&s;&s;el was to touch there. We were ju&s;t ready to &s;ail, when we were informed, that Lord Sidly was dead, occa&s;ioned by a fall from his hor&s;e; and that in his la&s;t moments, he had be&s;eeched his parents to remember their unhappy daughter. We were now again overwhelmed with grief and de&s;|pair; this &s;hock had &s;o great an effect on my poor Maria's health, that we were near lo&s;ing our pa&s;&s;age. She, however, exerted the utmo&s;t of her &s;trength, and we went on board.</P>
<P>I left Lord Sidly's will with Mr. Traffic, and a power (if it could be proved,) to &s;ue for the e&s;tate. I made no doubt, but Lord Beauclair's hatred would &s;till follow me; &s;o thought it expedient to change my name to Villars, which indeed was my real one; but as I never had received any of the e&s;tate of Beverly, I was not obliged
<PB N="92" REF="033744_0094_0FF909B082DDC7A8">
to keep the name. Our whole fortune, af|ter providing for our &s;ea &s;tores, amounted to no more than twelve hundred pounds. We took no &s;ervant with us, but Mrs. Worthy, the nur&s;e, and a girl, that at|tended Loui&s;a, who was eleven months old.</P>
<P>THE fourth of June, 1766, we &s;ailed. The weather was exceeding fine, and continued &s;o, till the next afternoon, when a gu&s;t &s;uddenly came up. The ve&s;|&s;el rolled exce&s;&s;ively, and my wife and poor little Henry were very &s;ick. Mrs. Worthy took him for the benefit of the air, on deck, but unu&s;ed to the motion of a &s;hip, her head turned; &s;he reeled, and fell overboard&mdash;and I never &s;aw them more."&mdash;Here Mr. Villars was for &s;ome time incapable of proceeding. "It is need|le&s;s" continued he, after he had recover|ed him&s;elf, "to de&s;cribe our di&s;tre&s;s on this occa&s;ion: the ve&s;&s;el immediately

<P>MY wife continued in fits for many hours; after they left her, &s;he remained in a violent fever, and in her delirium was continually calling for her child; and it was many days e'er &s;he became more tranquil.&mdash;I now &s;aw it was the will of the Almighty to cha&s;ti&s;e us, and prayed fervently for fortitude, to &s;up|port the trial I was in all probability to go through. Our attention was now rou&s;ed by the illne&s;s of our little Loui&s;a; who had been obliged to be weaned, during her mother's illne&s;s; &s;he was for many days &s;o bad, that we did not expect &s;he would have got to Madeira alive. After a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age we reached that I&s;land; I had letters to

Mr. Hargrave, who could contain him|&s;elf no longer, and who had di&s;covered vi&s;ible marks of unea&s;ine&s;s, now ap|proached Mr. Villars; and told him, "he was extremely happy to find the family, whom mo&s;t on earth he wi&s;hed to &s;ee; and &s;hould ever think the accident that drew him to his hou&s;e, the peculiar work of Providence."</P>

<P>Mr. VILLARS con&s;ented, (though with &s;ome reluctance) to be guided by them; but &s;aid his &s;pirits were &s;o much flurried, he could not write. The &s;prightly Eliza (who&s;e vivacity had been clouded at the thoughts of her Henry's leaving her)

<P>"HARGRAVE," &s;aid &s;he, (re&s;uming her &s;prightly air) "you &s;urely forget I have a long letter to write, and do you think I can write any thing coherent, after you have been talking to me in this manner. &mdash;But go and comfort Capt.

Your Henry is not the nothing, he once thought him&s;elf."&mdash;"I do indeed mo&s;t &s;incerely rejoice in this unexpected di&s;co|very," returned the Captain, "you know my heart&mdash;I need not tell my friend, that whatever gives him pain or plea&s;ure, has the &s;ame effect on me; how great then mu&s;t be my &s;atisfaction, to find him a member of &s;o worthy a family."</P>
<P>"I NEVER," &s;aid Hargrave, "was hap|py in my &s;ituation, though I experienced the greate&s;t kindne&s;s from Lord and La|dy Beauclair. I ever looked on my&s;elf as an u&s;urper; and the idea of Lady Maria's &s;ufferings were always in my mind. I

The next day, the company all a&s;&s;embled at Mr. Sommers's; as &s;oon as the cloth was removed, Mrs. Carely was called up; &s;he was no &s;ooner &s;eated, than Mr. Villars begged &s;he would favour them with an account of what befel her, after her fall from the &s;hip.

<P>"YOU no doubt &s;ir, remember ma&s;ter Harry was very &s;ick, and I carried him on deck for the benefit of the air; it was carele&s;s in me to walk &s;o nigh the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el. I know not what it was, but &s;omething &s;truck me, and I fell over|board;

I was too weak to walk, and one of the men &s;up|ported me, while the other carried the child; they carried me to a neat little hou&s;e near the banks of the river, and the women &s;upplied us with dry clothes; the dear child &s;eemed almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to every thing till the next day, he then cried very much for his Mamma. The good woman allowed us to &s;tay &s;everal days, and then advi&s;ed me to apply for a &s;er|vice, which I did; but I could earn very little with the child. I had three guineas, which I endeavoured to keep, to pay our pa&s;&s;age to England.</P>

This I did not, as I knew it would be in vain; but I wi&s;hed much to go to England, and &s;he was &s;o good as to furni&s;h me with nece&s;|&s;aries for the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>THE poor dear child, had forgot to call on his papa and mamma; and I would not remind him of them, as I thought it be&s;t in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to call him my own. When we arrived in Port&s;|mouth, I had but two guineas left; I in|tended going to Bri&s;tol, to Mr. Traffic, from whom I was in hopes to hear of you and my Lady. I &s;et out in a waggon. I met on the road a fellow &s;ervant, that had lived with us at Bath. I a&s;ked him, if Mr. Traffic &s;till lived in Bri&s;tol; he &s;aid

<P>OH! Sir, I now indeed thought my heart would have broke.&mdash;This very night our dear child fell &s;ick, occa&s;ioned by fatigue; we &s;topped at a &s;mall farm-hou&s;e, and were obliged to &s;tay there &s;everal weeks; the child remained long &s;ick, and had he been well, I knew not where to go; I had but one brother, (and he lived in Wales) and no other relations, that had it in their power to &s;erve me. The &s;ickly looks of my poor boy prevented any one's hiring me; I was reduced to my la&s;t crown, when a thought &s;truck me, that if lady Beauclair &s;aw the child, &s;he might perhaps have compa&s;&s;ion on him; as his parents were dead, their hatred

I &s;old the be&s;t gown I had, and was enabled to hire a lodging every night. We at length arrived in London; and I waited on Lady Beauclair, at a time I knew his Lord&s;hip was out. I got admittance, and related the whole &s;tory to her Lady|&s;hip; &s;he at fir&s;t thought me an impo&s;|tor; but when I &s;hewed her the medal, &s;he wept exceedingly; "poor boy!" &s;aid &s;he, "it is hard he &s;hould &s;uffer for the faults of his parents.

I thought my heart would have bur&s;t, to &s;ee the dear child taken into his Grandfathers hou&s;e as an object of chari|ty; I believe my Lady read my thoughts; for as &s;oon as we were alone, &s;he &s;aid, "you no doubt, nur&s;e, think it &s;trange, that I do not own my Grand&s;on; be|lieve me, I would willingly do it; but if Lord Beauclair had the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of his being Beverly's &s;on, he would never be prevailed on to &s;ee him."&mdash;She then told me to call him Henry Hargrave.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;hewn to a very genteel apart|ment near her Lady&s;hip's: in this room were two beds, one for my &s;weet boy, and the other for my&s;elf.&mdash;There was one clo&s;et filled with genteel cloathing for him, and a great deal of very good for my&s;elf. The other was filled with a num|ber of curious toys.&mdash;I &s;hall never for|get

the joy he expre&s;&s;ed in the opening of the&s;e clo&s;ets; I had got all his things down, and he was &s;itting in the mid&s;t of them, when her Lady&s;hip entered; he was &s;o deeply engaged, he did not per|ceive her; &s;he held up her finger in to|ken of &s;ilence, and &s;tood for &s;ome time &s;ilently admiring him; he at la&s;t &s;aw, and ran to her; he took her hand and ki&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>"AH, madam!" &s;aid he, "have you put all the&s;e pretty things here for me?" "Yes my dear," an&s;wered her Lady&s;hip, "and you &s;hall have a great many more, if you are a good boy."&mdash;"Indeed I will be very good; and love you dearly, if you will allow it," &s;aid he.&mdash;This &s;eemed to affect her very much: and in|deed it was a long time before &s;he could &s;ee him unmoved.&mdash;Her affection for him &s;eemed daily to encrea&s;e, and my Lord grew very fond of him.

<P>I SAW with plea&s;ure the improvement of my little ma&s;ter; nothing material happened during &s;everal years. Ma&s;ter Harry grew fa&s;t, and had every advan|tage a young man of fa&s;hion could have. &mdash;He pa&s;&s;ed for a di&s;tant relation of her Lady&s;hip's, and was beloved by every body.</P>
<P>ABOUT four years ago, he heard Lord Beauclair had a daughter, whom he had di&s;inherited; and it was uncertain whe|ther &s;he was &s;till living. He &s;eemed more thoughtful, and would &s;ometimes a&s;k me que&s;tions that rung my very &s;oul; and I was often tempted to break my promi&s;e; but fearing it might be a di&s;advantage to him, I remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="033744_0122_0FF90F13B2D1A8A8">SOMETIME after the war broke out in America, he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to go into the army. My Lord and Lady were very much aver&s;e to it; but my Lord &s;eeing him &s;o anxious, he procured him a lieu|tenancy.&mdash;During my &s;tay at lord Beau|clair's, I married Edward Carely, his Lord&s;hip's Butler. My Lady was &s;o very unea&s;y at Mr. Hargrave's going alone to America, that my Lord, to make her ea&s;y, gave Edward twenty guineas to en|li&s;t, and then procured him a halbert, that we might come out with Mr. Har|grave, which we did; and both of us en|deavoured to be as &s;erviceable as was in our power.</P>
<P>BUT, alas! my poor Edward was &s;hot at the defeat of Cornwallis;&mdash;&s;ince that time, I have &s;till continued with Mr. Hargrave.&mdash;The regiment had orders to march one morning by the dawn of day: I went, as u&s;ual, to know if my young

ma&s;ter had any commands for me; when, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, I found his bed not tumbled. He was gone&mdash;and I knew not where to look for him. I made every enquiry for him, but to no purpo&s;e.&mdash; The fourth day, I heard two officers talk|ing about him: they &s;aid, that Captain Bellmore was certainly killed; and if Mr. Hargrave had gone in &s;earch of him, he would have been back, had he not been taken. They then &s;aid, it would, they were afraid, go hard with him, as he would doubtle&s;s be taken for a &s;py.</P>
<P>THIS terrified me to &s;uch a degree, I &s;carcely know how I got to the tent.&mdash; I immediately took the little money I had, and a change of cloaths in a handker|chief, and &s;et out I knew not whether.&mdash; I thought I heard the gentlemen &s;ay, he would be brought to this place.&mdash;I en|quired my way: and had not proceeded far, before I was taken up and &s;earched.

They &s;aid, I had been employed by the enemy to carry letters to di&s;affected per|&s;ons, and gain intelligence: this I po&s;i|tively denied.

<P>HERE the good woman cea&s;ed; and the company thanked her for the infor|mation &s;he had given them.

<P><PB N="123" REF="033744_0125_0FF90F1C588F5698">IT was now concluded they &s;hould &s;et out in a few days. As nothing material happened during the&s;e few days, we will leave the gentlemen, and return to the little cottage of Mr. Villars, where the charming Loui&s;a was &s;itting at work with her mamma.&mdash;Love until now, a &s;tranger to her brea&s;t, had robbed her cheeks of its wonted bloom, and left a languid palene&s;s, that rather added to her charms. Mrs. Villars &s;aw, with pain, the change; and had for &s;ome time &s;ought an oppor|tunity to &s;peak to her.</P>
<P>POOR Loui&s;a knew a Peace between England and America, was negociating; and con&s;equently, the troops would be recalled. Though &s;he would never con|&s;ent to a clande&s;tine marriage, &s;till &s;he could not &s;upport the thought of never again beholding her beloved William.&mdash; Forgetting &s;he was not alone, &s;he &s;ighed deeply. Mrs. Villars now &s;poke: what

is the matter Loui&s;a?" &s;aid &s;he, "you are not well, I fear.&mdash;A con&s;cious blu&s;h o'er|&s;pread her cheek; "I am very well, ma|dam, why do you think otherwi&s;e?"&mdash; "No, my dear Loui&s;a," replied Mrs. Vil|lars, "your heart is not at ea&s;e; be not &s;urpri&s;ed, when I tell you I have long known the cau&s;e of the change, which I grieve to &s;ee in your health."</P>
<P>LOUISA, ever u&s;ed to make her mama her friend and confidant, now threw her&s;elf into her arms, and confe&s;&s;ed her love, her promi&s;e to Captain Bellmore, and all her doubts and fears.&mdash;Mrs. Vil|lars embraced her tenderly, and &s;aid ma|ny affectionate things; which, though &s;he did not attempt to cheri&s;h her hopes, was &s;till a balm to her drooping &s;pirits.</P>
<P>SOME hours pa&s;t in this manner; when Loui&s;a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letter Mi&s;s Sommers wrote, for permi&s;|&s;ion to discover Mr. Villars's family, never came to hand.</NOTE> received a letter from her friend,

which gave them an account of Mr. Hargrave's generous behaviour before he was di&s;covered to be the &s;on of Mr. Villars.</P>
<P>THEY had &s;carcely time to extol his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, when Edward entered with another, which contained the wel|come news of the di&s;covery. The joy of this worthy Family may be more ea&s;ily imagined than de&s;cribed. To find in &s;o fine a youth, the &s;on, &s;he had &s;o long lo&s;t, was too much for the depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of Mrs. Villars; and Loui&s;a and her little brothers could &s;carcely keep her from fainting. She at length recovered &s;uffi|ciently to thank the Supreme Being, who, for wi&s;e purpo&s;es, had robbed her of her Son, and now ble&s;&s;ed the declin|ing years, by returning him &s;o worthy.</P>
<P>THE boys expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction in the livelie&s;t manner. Loui&s;a for a time for|got the &s;orrows of her heart; and the
<PB N="126" REF="033744_0128_0FF90F235ADC82B8">
voice of joy and gladne&s;s re&s;ounded in this peaceful habitation. They pa&s;&s;ed three days in the utmo&s;t impatience; on the fourth, which was the day they were expected, Loui&s;a, attended by her two brothers, and &s;everal of the genteel peo|ple of the village, rode out to meet them. At the end of four miles, they perceived them advancing. At the &s;ight of Capt. Bellmore, (who Loui&s;a had not been in|formed was coming with them,) the bri|dle dropped from her hand, and &s;he was near falling to the ground. A Mi&s;s Her|bert, and her brother, who were nigh, &s;upported her, and &s;he &s;oon recovered, &s;ufficiently to go on.</P>
<P>Mr. VILLARS was extremely plea&s;ed with this mark of attention in his neigh|bours; the amiable Henry immediately di&s;mounted, and flew to his &s;i&s;ter. "Let me a&s;&s;i&s;t you to alight, my dear Loui&s;a," &s;aid he, "you look ill; &s;hall I call for

any a&s;&s;i&s;tance?" "No, my dear bro|ther, my &s;pirits are only a little flurried at this unexpected happine&s;s," returned &s;he. The company now all advanced: The complai&s;ance which was due to the brother on this occa&s;ion, could &s;carcely re&s;train the Capt. from flying to her be|fore her brother, who, after tenderly pre&s;&s;ing her to his brea&s;t, left her to his friend, and returned to his Father, who was receiving the congratulations of his neighbours; which took up &s;o much time, that the lovers had an opportunity, unob&s;erved, to pour forth the tendere&s;t effu&s;ions of the heart.</P>
<P>LOUISA, being now perfectly recover|ed, remounted her hor&s;e, and they all proceeded toward the village, where they arrived in a &s;hort time.&mdash;Mrs. Villars did not wi&s;h to meet her &s;on in company; &mdash;his Father and Loui&s;a, therefore, con|ducted him to her apartment.&mdash;Inured to

grief, and a &s;tranger to exce&s;s of joy, Mrs. Villars could not &s;ummon re&s;olu|tion &s;ufficient to receive him with any degree of compo&s;ure: when he entered the room, &s;he was nigh fainting; and could only &s;ay when he threw him&s;elf at her feet. "My beloved! my long lo&s;t Son!"&mdash;and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s in his arms.&mdash; A maternal tear came to her relief, and &s;he &s;oon recovered.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time &s;pent in the mo&s;t affecting manner, &s;he a&s;ked him &s;everal que&s;tions concerning her Parents; this was the &s;ubject, of all others, he mo&s;t wi&s;hed to avoid. "When you are more compo&s;ed, my dear madam," &s;aid he, "I will give you all the information in my power; at pre&s;ent, let us join our friends, and be happy."&mdash;She con&s;ented, and &s;uffered her&s;elf to be led to the parlour, where the company were all a&s;&s;embled. &mdash;The day was &s;pent with the utmo&s;t joy

and &s;atisfaction; and concluded with a &s;ocial dance.</P>
<P>THE next morning, Mr. Hargrave took an opportunity to tell Loui&s;a, he hoped to have it in his power to make her happy with his friend, if &s;he conti|nued as much of the turtle as he had &s;ince they left her.&mdash;"Believe me, my dear &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid he, "I cannot be completely happy, while you and Wil|liam are wretched;&mdash;our departure for England mu&s;t be &s;peedy." At the&s;e words, the tears &s;tarted in her eyes.&mdash; Oh! my brother," &s;aid &s;he, "are you again to leave us."&mdash;"It cannot be a|voided," replied he, "our troops will &s;oon be recalled; and indeed all our in|tere&s;t demand my going."</P>
<P>I intend mentioning to my grandmo|ther the di&s;covery I have made; and make no doubt but I &s;hall be able to
<PB N="130" REF="033744_0132_0FF90F2F3AA2E8F8">
bring about a reconciliation; for &s;ince Lord Beauclair's health has been declin|ing, I have had great rea&s;on to think &s;omething hangs heavy at his heart. This once accompli&s;hed, Sir John Bell|more's con&s;ent to your union is cer|tain."</P>
<P>"My dear, brother," &s;aid Loui&s;a, "in &s;triving to reconcile the families, you will ruin your future pro&s;pects."&mdash; "No no, my dear," returned he, "I &s;hall go cautiou&s;ly to work for all our &s;akes; keep up your &s;pirits, and hope the be&s;t: but do not mention my inten|tions to any one."</P>
<P>CAPT. Bellmore now approached;&mdash; Henry, making an excu&s;e, left them; "William," &s;aid he, turning to Loui&s;a as he went out, "knows my intentions; you need be under no re&s;traint with him." &mdash;"What an excellent Brother have I,"
<PB N="131" REF="033744_0133_0FF90F324810DD78">
&s;aid Loui&s;a.&mdash;"You know not nigh his worth," returned the Captain. She then told him the conver&s;ation which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;"Oh! my dear Loui&s;a," &s;aid he, "he has not let you into half his views, he &s;eems determined to make us happy."&mdash;"You mu&s;t &s;oon leave us," interrupted &s;he, "perhaps never to re|turn."&mdash;"My deare&s;t life," cried he, pre&s;&s;ing her to his heart, nothing but death &s;hall keep me from you.&mdash;I am obliged to go with the regiment; but I will &s;oon return."</P>
<P>LOUISA could with difficulty refrain from tears; the thought of their going was too much for her.&mdash;A conver&s;ation the mo&s;t tender, en&s;ued; and nigh two hours pa&s;t imperceptibly.</P>
<P>THE generous Henry was not unem|ployed at this time; he took his parents a&s;ide, and, finding they were acquainted
<PB N="132" REF="033744_0134_0FF90F33DEE30F08">
with the attachment of his friend and &s;i&s;|ter, endeavoured to gain their con&s;ent to their union.&mdash;Mr. Villars &s;aid he had not the lea&s;t objection, if Sir John Bellmore's con&s;ent could be obtained.</P>
<P>HENRY told him ingenuou&s;ly, that there was no rea&s;on to expect that with|out a fortune; but he &s;hould endeavour to obtain it, and only begged his Father if he failed, not to oppo&s;e an union, on which the happine&s;s of two people mo&s;t dear to him, depended.</P>
<P>Mr. VILLARS was &s;o happy at again find|ing this long-lo&s;t Son, it was difficult for him to refu&s;e him any thing. He at length &s;aid, he would do nothing to oppo&s;e their happine&s;s. This was &s;o nigh con|&s;enting, the &s;on would pre&s;s no farther; but acknowledged it a particular favour done him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He then returned to the lovers, and
<PB N="133" REF="033744_0135_0FF90F36314075A0">
told them, as he was tired of &s;eeing long faces, he had been making intere&s;t to get them in bondage, &s;ince he found nothing &s;hort of everla&s;ting chains would content them; they both &s;miled, but could not comprehend him: he in a few words explained him&s;elf. The gloom was immediately bani&s;hed from their countenances, and there was not a heavy heart at the cottage.</P>
<P>SEVERAL weeks was &s;pent in the greate&s;t felicity; when Mr. Hargrave received a letter from Mr. Sommers, in which he reque&s;ted him to come imme|diately to town, as he had received di&s;|patches from England for him. He immediately prepared for his journey, and &s;et out the next day; leaving his friend, who was now as lively as him&s;elf, to keep up their &s;pirits until his return.</P>

almo&s;t every other idea, and he arrived in town much &s;ooner than could be expected.&mdash;Mr. Sommers was gone out of town, and not expected in le&s;s than two days.

<P>MY Lady thought this a favourable opportunity&punc; and by degrees di&s;covered your birth.

"True," an&s;wered he, "I mu&s;t not re|pine.

&s;haring it with her." Mr. Sommers had for &s;ome time &s;een an attachment between his young friend and daughter, and would never have been aver&s;e to the match; but now to hear him &s;peak in this manner, was quite beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectation. "My Lord," &s;aid he, "I hope Eliza is &s;en&s;ible of the hon|our you do her, nothing can give me more plea&s;ure than &s;uch a connection; though your fortune is more than &s;he has a right to expect; believe me, I e&s;|teem your virtues much higher, and &s;hould have been happy, had you put it in my power to have convinced you, that my con&s;ent would have as freely been given to Mr. Hargrave as to Lord Beauclair." "Oh! Sir," returned his Lord&s;hip, "you have long &s;ince convin|ced me of your friend&s;hip; you now make me the happie&s;t of men; I will endeavour to merit, as far as lies in my power, the

an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for his going imme|diately to England; and earne&s;tly beg|ged to have the ceremony performed be|fore he went.&mdash;The thought of parting, drew tears from Eliza. She con&s;ented, to his wi&s;hes; and it was concluded, the marriage &s;hould take place as &s;oon as Mr. Villars's family could come to town.</P>
<P>IT was late when they parted; Lord Beauclair retired to write to Lady Beau|clair, as an opportunity offered for Eng|land. He wrote to her in the mo&s;t af|fectionate manner, giving her a full account of his meeting with his parents; his engagements with Mi&s;s Sommers, and his intention of &s;oon returning: he &s;aid nothing of a de&s;ign he had of per|&s;uading his father and his family to return with him to England, lea&s;t he &s;hould fail. &mdash;He &s;pent the next day with his Eliza, and the following &s;et out for&mdash;, where he &s;oon arrived.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="033744_0144_0FF90F4E8F5454E8">Mrs. VILLARS bore the death of her father, with greater re&s;ignation than her &s;on expected; his having mentioned her with kindne&s;s in his la&s;t moments, &s;eemed a great con&s;olation. "He has forgiven me!" exclaimed &s;he, cla&s;ping her hands, "he no doubt, ble&s;&s;ed me with his dying breath! and I am happy my mother too! could I once more throw my&s;elf at her feet."</P>
<P>"YOU &s;hall, my deare&s;t madam." an|&s;wered Lord Beauclair; it is my earne&s;t de&s;ire that we will return to England." &mdash;"What," &s;aid Mr. Villars, "go to a place where I have never experien|ced any thing but trouble."&mdash;"Every comfort awaits you now, my dear Sir; &mdash;If the fifteen thou&s;and pounds my Grandfather has left my Mother, is in|&s;ufficient, as much of my fortune as you wi&s;h to make u&s;e of, is entirely at your &s;ervice."</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="033744_0145_0FF90F5028939A90">AH! my Henry, &s;uch a Son as you are, can be refu&s;ed nothing. Fifteen thou&s;and pounds is much more than we want for your Mother; and I will never alter our manner of living. If we go with you to England, we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on living retired." In this he was joined by Mrs Villars.</P>
<P>THEIR amiable &s;on took a hand of each. "You &s;hall live as you plea&s;e, my dear Parents," &s;aid he, "only let me have the happine&s;s of having you near me." He then informed them of his engagements with Mi&s;s Sommers. He begged his Father's pardon for not con|&s;ulting him; he &s;aid his affections were engaged, before he knew he had a Fa|ther. That as he had often heard his opi|nion of Mi&s;s Sommers, he had ventured to a&s;k his Papa's con&s;ent; which he had obtained, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, that the union might &s;oon take place. Mr. Vil|lars
<PB N="144" REF="033744_0146_0FF8C35AEF262508">
told him, he had &s;een the attach|ment between them; that it gave him plea&s;ure, and he &s;hould not retard their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair thanked him; and as he thought he &s;aw no ob&s;tacle to the union of his &s;i&s;ter and friend, mentioned it.&mdash;Mr. Villars &s;aid he had no objec|tion; but he thought Sir John Bellmore's con&s;ent ought to be gained. "But,"&mdash; added he, "he is &s;aid to be an odd kind of a man; and I make no doubt, but he has made engagements for his &s;on."</P>
<P>AT that moment, Capt. Bellmore and Loui&s;a, with her Brothers, returned from walking. They were all &s;oon acquaint|ed with what had happened: (as &s;oon as they entered, Mrs. Villars retired to her chamber, to indulge her tears.) They all advanced, to congratulate the young Lord. A tear &s;tole down the cheek of
<PB N="145" REF="033744_0147_0FF90F52820C75B8">
the gentle Loui&s;a: her Brother's good fortune, was occa&s;ioned by the death of her Grandfather; who, unkind as he had been, &s;he was always taught to re|vere: "come my dear Loui&s;a," cried her Brother, "be chearful; what do you &s;ay for a trip to England." "Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, looking at her Father. "True," &s;aid Mr. Villars, your brother has even per&s;uaded me to go. She then turned her eyes on the Captain, who was in an extacy&mdash;"my dear Henry," &s;aid he to him in a low voice, "you are the Guar|dian Angel of us all." Loui&s;a and her Brother, expre&s;&s;ed much &s;atisfaction at the thoughts of going to England.&mdash; Mr. Villars &s;aid it would ever make him happy, to have his children &s;o; but could he have kept them all with him, he would have preferred &s;taying in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>TRANQUILITY again reigned at the
<PB N="146" REF="033744_0148_0FF90F54D38AE248">
cottage; and the hearts of the worthy poor, were gladdened by the genero&s;ity of the amiable Henry. The report of their quitting the place, was &s;oon known; and mo&s;t &s;incerely regretted. A gentle|man who&s;e lands joined Mr. Villars, purcha&s;ed the farm; and preparations were made for their removal; which was accompli&s;hed in &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair, and his &s;i&s;ter, wrote to Mi&s;s Sommers, to apprize her of their coming; they had a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age, and arrived, amid&s;t the congratulations of their friends. Mr. Sommers in&s;i&s;ted on their making his hou&s;e their home, during their &s;tay in town. The worthy Mrs. Carely, immediately waited on Mrs. Villars; &s;he threw her&s;elf at her feet, and bathed her hands with her tears. Mrs. Villars was very much af|fected, &s;he wi&s;hed to a&s;k her many que&s;|tions;
<PB N="147" REF="033744_0149_0FF90F57253B6328">
and for that purpo&s;e retired with her to her chamber.</P>
<P>SOON after they arrived, preparations were made for the nuptials of Lord Beauclair and Mi&s;s Sommers; which took place in a month. The &s;prightly Eliza, though always charming, this day &s;hone more than ever. Her dre&s;s, was a white lu&s;tring &s;prigged with &s;ilver, and flounced with a &s;ilver net; fe&s;tooned with bunches of white ro&s;es, and lillies of the valley; her fine dark hair, undi&s;|gui&s;ed by powder, hang in ringlets down her neck; on her head, &s;he wore a &s;prig of lillies of the valley, and a white feather.</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair looked remarkably well; he was dre&s;&s;ed entirely in his regi|mentals, excepting a white &s;attin ve&s;t, trimmed with &s;ilver lace. Loui&s;a appeared uncommonly beautiful. Capt. Bellmore,
<PB N="148" REF="033744_0150_0FF90F5975904F90">
who had recovered his &s;pirits, from the plea&s;ing hopes he now enjoyed; was re|markably chearful, which made him ap|pear (particularly to Loui&s;a) more charm|ing than ever. Soon after the nuptials, they were informed a fleet would &s;ail for England, &s;ome time in July, with a divi&s;ion of the troops. As peace had taken place, it was not difficult for them to obtain leave to return home.</P>
<P>PREPARATIONS were made for the pa&s;&s;age; and in a few weeks they were ready to embark for England.&mdash; Lady Beauclair felt a reluctance at quit|ting her parents; which nothing but the extreme affection &s;he had for her Lord, could era&s;e.</P>
<P>THE fleet being ready to &s;ail, they embarked;&mdash;Mrs. Carely again en|tered her beloved Mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;ervice.&mdash; Mr. Sommers returned home with his
<PB N="149" REF="033744_0151_0FF90F5BCD235F70">
family, and though they parted with their daughter, with reluctance, they were happy to &s;ee her &s;o well &s;ituated. The pa&s;&s;age was plea&s;ant; they &s;pent the time happily, and arrived in perfect health, the fir&s;t week in September.</P>
<P>WHEN they arrived in London, Lord Beauclair took lodgings not far from Lady Beauclair; as he wi&s;hed to pre|pare his Grandmother for the interview, &s;he &s;o little expected. Mrs. Villars would gladly have flown to her mother; but &s;he was per&s;uaded to re&s;train her im|patience for a &s;hort time. Lord Beau|clair, &s;ent to inform her of his arrival, and his intention of waiting on her imme|diately. The old Lady met him with emotion; "Oh! my Son!" &s;aid &s;he, am I once more permitted to fold thee in the&s;e arms?&mdash;But &s;ay, can you forgive me? can you forgive the &s;hade of your departed Grandfather, for the unkind
<PB N="150" REF="033744_0152_0FF90F5E235201E8">
u&s;age your poor mother has received, and our bringing you up in ignorance of your birth?&mdash;"Dear madam," &s;aid he, "I have nothing to forgive; you have been a parent to me, all happens for the be&s;t; had I known my birth, I might not have gone to America, and con&s;e|quently have never found my Parents." "Oh!" &s;aid &s;he, "heaven directed you to them: my poor Maria! &s;hall I ever behold her again&mdash;but &s;he cannot wi&s;h to &s;ee me." "Your Lady&s;hip is mi&s;ta|ken," returned he; &s;he wi&s;hes nothing &s;o much as to throw her&s;elf at your feet, and crave your ble&s;&s;ing." Ah! how readily would I give it: poor Beverly, how hardly he has been u&s;ed too.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time, Lord Beauclair told her of his marriage, and of his pa|rents having returned with him. She &s;eemed in an extacy; &s;he would not al|low him to &s;tay a moment, but in&s;i&s;ted on
<PB N="151" REF="033744_0153_0FF90F607967E470">
his bringing them all to her immediate|ly, which he accordingly did: the old Lady's &s;pirits had been &s;o exhau&s;ted, that &s;he felt her&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k of meeting them all together, but de|&s;ired to &s;ee her daughter alone; the meeting can be ea&s;ier imagined than de|&s;cribed: they remained &s;ome time toge|ther, and then joined the company: as Lady Beauclair entered, &s;he turned to Mr. Villars; "Mr. Beverly," &s;aid &s;he, holding out her hand, "we have u&s;ed you unkindly; can you forgive?"&mdash; "Madam," replied he; "the happine&s;s I now enjoy, compen&s;ates for all pa&s;t troubles." "I would not blame our departed friend," &s;aid &s;he, but believe me, I always wi&s;hed to be a friend to you, had it been in my power." Mr. Villars begged &s;he would think of nothing that had pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;but give him leave to intro|duce his children to her; &s;o &s;aying, he took Lady Beauclair in one hand, and
<PB N="152" REF="033744_0154_0FF91094CFB11AE8">
Loui&s;a in the other; and led them to her Lady&s;hip, who received them in the mo&s;t affectionate manner; Lord Beauclair pre&s;ented his two brothers, and his friend. After a con&s;iderable time, Lady Beauclair, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Mr Vil|lars, a&s;ked him why he had changed his name, and how he wi&s;hed to &s;ettle him|&s;elf. "Is not my hou&s;e," continued &s;he, large enough for us all? If not, Hamp|ton-Hall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her Lady&s;hip's Country Seat.</NOTE> is at your &s;ervice."</P>
<P>HER fir&s;t que&s;tion he evaded; as he did not wi&s;h to revive di&s;agreeable circum|&s;tances but as little as po&s;&s;ible. "With regard to my &s;ettling," &s;aid he, troubles in early life.&mdash;She &s;ighed; "excu&s;e me, Madam&mdash;troubles have imbibed in us a love of retirement; and any other way of life, I feel, can never make me happy." "You &s;hall live as you plea&s;e," replied
<PB N="153" REF="033744_0155_0FF9109757CEC9A0">
her Lady&s;hip; "but you would not wi&s;h to retire from your friends." "By no means," an&s;wered he, "I &s;hould prefer a &s;nug place in the country, where I could always enjoy my&s;elf and be happy with my friends."</P>
<P>THEY all approved his choice; and it was concluded, that they &s;hould &s;till con|tinue with her Lady&s;hip; and Lord Beau|clair &s;hould in a few days attend his fa|ther in looking for a place to &s;uit him. Capt. Bellmore would again have return|ed to his lodgings, but the old Lady would not allow him.</P>
<P>THE next day, he &s;et out for Portland-Grove, his Father's country &s;eat. He had not an opportunity of &s;peaking to Lou|i&s;a in private; but, at parting, put a let|ter into her hand, filled with the mo&s;t la&s;t|ing profe&s;&s;ions of love, and a promi&s;e to &s;ee her again in a &s;hort time. After taking a
<PB N="154" REF="033744_0156_0FF9109FE5707130">
polite leave, he mounted his hor&s;e, and rode off.</P>
<P>THE old Lady &s;aw the trembling tear in the languid blue eye of Loui&s;a, which followed him until out of &s;ight; and her pretence to quit the room, did not pa&s;s unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>"MY dear Eliza," &s;aid Lady Beauclair, "has not this hand&s;ome Captain made an impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of your &s;i&s;|ter!"&mdash;"Why does your lady&s;hip think &s;o?" "I think I &s;ee it," &s;aid &s;he; it is not from curio&s;ity; but I have heard Sir John Bellmore has made engagements for his Son, with Sir Danvers Lovemore, who has an only Daughter, who&s;e for|tune will be forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>"AH!" &s;aid Eliza, who&s;e gentle heart caught the alarm for her friend, "my dear madam," do not mention this to
<PB N="155" REF="033744_0157_0FF910A7A0A75C18">
Loui&s;a&mdash;it is then as I feared, cried the old Lady, "if this is the ca&s;e," an&s;wered Lady Beauclair, "they are the mo&s;t un|happy people on earth."</P>
<P>Mrs. VILLARS and Loui&s;a ju&s;t enter|ing, put a &s;top to the di&s;cour&s;e. Loui&s;a perceived her friends countenance change, "What is the matter, my dear Eliza," &s;aid &s;he, "are you not well?" "O yes," replied &s;he, "only a little vapori&s;h; I will go and look for your Brother, and we will take a walk in the Park:" &s;o &s;ay|ing, &s;he quitted the room. "Indeed ma|dam, &s;aid Loui&s;a," turning to her Mama, "my &s;i&s;ter is not well; I had better fol|low." "You are a good girl, Loui&s;a," &s;aid her Grandmother, I believe your fears are without foundation,"&mdash;Loui&s;a, &s;at down; but &s;eemed very unea&s;y.</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair &s;oon came in leading
<PB N="156" REF="033744_0158_0FF910AB76F083A0">
his Lady, who had on her hat and gloves. "Come Loui&s;a," &s;aid he, "Eliza wi&s;hes to walk in the Park this morning; get your hat." She ro&s;e immediately, and accompanied them. They had not walked far, before they pa&s;t two Ladies; one mo&s;t &s;uperbly dre&s;|&s;ed, and very much affected, hanging on the arm of the other; and talked &s;o loud, that the conver&s;ation was plainly heard by Lord Beauclair and the Ladies. "Lord, my dear," &s;aid the affected Lady, "it is mon&s;trous to walk thus without a Beau; why does Sir George leave us?" "He will return directly, &s;aid the other&mdash;but is not your intended re|turned from America?" "No, I believe not," replied &s;he carele&s;sly; "I am very ea&s;y about it, I a&s;&s;ure you."&mdash; "Why," returned the other, "he is very hand&s;ome, they tell me."&mdash;"Aye, but he has no title; its a freak of Papa's, becau&s;e there is a good deal of money.
<PB N="157" REF="033744_0159_0FF910B242D547E0">
But, upon my life, I had rather have Lord Boquet, with his &s;mall fortune."</P>
<P>"BUT, my dear," &s;aid her friend, you are not acquainted with this hand|&s;ome young Captain.&mdash;"True; but they &s;ay he is as grave as a Methodi&s;t Par&s;on; and would you believe it, he would as &s;oon touch a &s;nake as a card." At that moment, a gentleman joined them, and they walked another way.</P>
<P>"WHO can that affected creature be?" &s;aid Lady Beauclair.&mdash;"A Mi&s;s Lovemore," replied my Lord: A fan|ta&s;tical fool, with a great fortune; I &s;up|po&s;e &s;ome mi&s;erly fellow has been mak|ing a bargain with her father to encrea&s;e his &s;on's riches, at the expence of his peace." "I am &s;ure," &s;aid Loui&s;a, "I &s;hould &s;incerely pity the man that is &s;old for a fortune, to &s;uch a creature."&mdash; "You would indeed have thought &s;o,
<PB N="158" REF="033744_0160_0FF910B4C09AE458">
Lady Beauclair, if you knew who it was."</P>
<P>SHE had told his Lord&s;hip, what his Grandmother had told her, (but did not mention the name, as it had e&s;caped her memory). He would not credit it, but laughed at it as an idle report. This con|ver&s;ation, however, convinced her of its truth, and &s;he was happy to find the Lady &s;o indifferent. As &s;oon as an op|portunity offered, &s;he mentioned it to his Lord&s;hip, who now began to think &s;eri|ou&s;ly of the matter; and to form &s;chemes to &s;erve his friend; where we will leave him, and return to Captain Bellmore, who arrived at his Father's gate ju&s;t as he was returning from riding.</P>
<P>"MY dear William," &s;aid he, "how glad I am to &s;ee you. I intended writing to you by the next packet."&mdash;"I am happy, Sir," replied he, "to have &s;aved you that trouble.". They now entered
<PB N="159" REF="033744_0161_0FF910B70B7282F0">
the hou&s;e; his Mother and Si&s;ter re|ceived him with the greate&s;t joy. Sir John &s;eemed in high &s;pirits, and often hinted having &s;omething of con&s;equence to impart to him.</P>
<P>THE next morning, Mi&s;s Bellmore followed her Brother into the garden.&mdash; "I come, my dear William, to prepare you for a di&s;agreeable piece of intelli|gence, which you will no doubt &s;oon hear."&mdash;She then briefly informed him of the engagements his Father had formed for him.</P>
<P>HE &s;tood like one amazed: at length "my Augu&s;ta," &s;aid he, "whatever mer|cenary views my Father may have for me, I call my God to witne&s;s can never be fulfilled."&mdash;"Hu&s;h! William, you know my Father is arbitrary."</P>
<P>CAPT. Bellmore then informed his
<PB N="160" REF="033744_0162_0FF910BDE11EED78">
Si&s;ter of his attachment to Loui&s;a; and his po&s;itive determination to marry no one el&s;e.&mdash;The gentle heart of Mi&s;s Bellmore was pained from the fir&s;t men|tion of this affair: how much more did &s;he feel for him, when &s;he found his af|fections were engaged. She once had loved a worthy object; and but for the unbounded avarice of Sir John, had been happy. Her tears flowed too fa&s;t for ut|terance; her brother's &s;ituation reminded her of her own. She wept for both&mdash; and, waving her hand in &s;ilent angui&s;h, left him" and Capt. Bellmore returned to the hou&s;e with a heavy heart.</P>
<P>AT breakfa&s;t, Sir John told him, he had &s;omething of con&s;equence to men|tion to him: and de&s;ired him to follow him to his &s;tudy; in a few words, Sir John informed him of the engagements he had made, and de&s;ired he would im|mediately fulfil them.&mdash;His &s;on, in vain,
<PB N="161" REF="033744_0163_0FF910C6123DE048">
endeavoured to remon&s;trate with him; he gave him only two days to con&s;ider of his propo&s;al; and if he would not con&s;ent to marry Mi&s;s Lovemore, he &s;hould immediately &s;ail for India; and there &s;tay until he found him&s;elf di&s;|po&s;ed to obey.</P>
<P>HIS &s;on now told him, his affections were engaged to a Lady, who&s;e connec|tions were far more noble than Mi&s;s Lovemore's, and who&s;e fortune, though not &s;o large, was very hand&s;ome. His father replied, "had he known it &s;ooner, he might, perhaps, have con&s;idered of it; but his word was given to Sir Dan|vers; and he was determined to be obeyed, on pain of his la&s;ting di&s;plea|&s;ure; &s;o &s;aying, he flounced out of the room.</P>
<P>CAPT. Bellmore threw him&s;elf on the &s;ofa, and gave a loo&s;e to tears he could
<PB N="162" REF="033744_0164_0FF910C864DE9558">
not retain.&mdash;Lady Bellmore came to him, and taking his hand, &s;aid, "my dear William! compo&s;e your&s;elf."&mdash;"Ma|dam," cried he, ri&s;ing, "my Father has given me two days to con&s;ider of his hated propo&s;al;&mdash;there needs not two hours; tell him, I will leave the country if he in&s;i&s;ts upon it; for never, never, will I con&s;ent to this dete&s;ted marriage; &s;o &s;aying, he left the room, ordered his hor&s;es; and, after bidding his mother and &s;i&s;ter, (who intreated him to &s;tay) adieu, he &s;et out for London.</P>
<P>SIR John was in a violent rage, when he heard of his &s;on's determination and departure.&mdash;Lady Bellmore wept, and begged him to break with Sir Danvers, but in vain.</P>
<P>WHEN Capt. Bellmore arrived in London, he waited only to dre&s;s, and flew immediately to his Loui&s;a. His
<PB N="163" REF="033744_0165_0FF910CD860EB090">
pale and altered countenance, directly informed her &s;omething had happened.</P>
<P>THERE was a great deal of company when he arrived; and he had not an opportunity of &s;peaking to Loui&s;a, until the evening. "What is the matter?" &s;aid &s;he; "you are ill, or &s;omething has troubled you."&mdash;"Oh, my Loui&s;a! my beloved Loui&s;a! we mu&s;t part! I mu&s;t leave you&mdash;perhaps for ever."</P>
<P>SHE heard no more, but fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s in his arms; at that in&s;tant, Lord and Lady Beauclair entered.&mdash;Oh! my friend, &s;aid the unhappy William, "my inhuman Father will be the death of us both."&mdash;"I know how it will be," re|plied his Lord&s;hip; "I dreaded this in|terview, but endeavour to be ea&s;y, all may yet be well."</P>
<P>CAPT. Bellmore heard him not; he
<PB N="164" REF="033744_0166_0FF910CF1D084428">
cla&s;ped his lovely burden to his brea&s;t, whil&s;t Lady Beauclair was endeavouring to bring her to life. Mrs. Villars and her mother now entered; Bellmore &s;eemed not to &s;ee them; but, bathing the hands of his Loui&s;a with his tears, &s;aid, "would to heaven, my angel, thou had&s;t let me die in the American fore&s;t; we then had both been happy."</P>
<P>LOUISA then looked up. "Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, wildly, "they have taken him away; he is gone&mdash;he is gone."&mdash;"No, my life," cried he, "I am here, and if you can take a beggar to thy arms, will never leave thee.</P>
<P>THE old Lady &s;eemed very much af|fected. "The&s;e hearts," &s;aid &s;he, mu&s;t not be parted.&mdash;Mrs. Villars, who&s;e fright had rendered her in almo&s;t the &s;ame &s;ituation with Loui&s;a, now advan|ced towards her. "Loui&s;a," &s;aid &s;he,

"you mu&s;t go and lay down; you will be better pre&s;ently."&mdash;She ro&s;e and fol|lowed her Mama, giving Capt. Bellmore, who &s;tood motionle&s;s, a look of infinite di&s;tre&s;s. The Ladies all went with Loui|&s;a, for whom they were very apprehen|&s;ive.</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair attempted to comfort his friend. "William," &s;aid he, "you have no re&s;olution; why &s;o &s;oon ca&s;t down; we have heard of your Father's de&s;ign, and have the plea&s;ure to tell you the Lady has not more inclination to ful|fil the engagement, than your&s;elf. He then related the conver&s;ation they had heard in the Park. This afforded &s;ome con&s;olation to his depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits; and he con&s;ented that Lord Beauclair &s;hould endeavour to per&s;uade Mi&s;s Lovemore to refu&s;e him.</P>

Loui&s;a was very ill; that &s;he made no an&s;wer to any thing that was &s;aid to her; that Lady Beauclair, and her Mama, de|&s;ired Capt. Bellmore would go to her, and appear to be quite compo&s;ed; they both followed her to Loui&s;a's room: Lord Beauclair approached the bed, and affecting a lively air; "what is the mat|ter Loui&s;a," &s;aid he? "Brother," an|&s;wered &s;he, wildly; "William is gone&mdash; he &s;aid he mu&s;t leave me for ever;"&mdash; "you mi&s;take," replied the Captain&mdash; "your William is here." He then ap|proached, and threw him&s;elf on his knees by her bed-&s;ide; here I am, my love, no force on earth &s;hall tear me from you." "Why did you &s;ay, we mu&s;t part then?" &s;aid &s;he. A flood of tears now came to her relief, and &s;he &s;eemed better. "Tell me, William," exclaim|ed &s;he; "what has troubled you,"&mdash; "when you are more compo&s;ed, my life, an&s;wered he. "I am much better

now," &s;aid &s;he, rai&s;ing her&s;elf on the bed. "My dear &s;i&s;ter," cried Lady Beauclair; "you mu&s;t a&s;k no que&s;tions to night, it is late; to-morrow you &s;hall be informed of what you wi&s;h to know." Capt. Bellmore, after folding her in his arms; and &s;wearing no force on earth &s;hould con&s;train him to leave her, took his leave. Lord Beauclair was obliged to do the &s;ame, as his Eliza would not be prevailed on to leave her friend that night.</P>
<P>THE old Lady, and Mrs. Villars had left the room, when they found her rea|&s;on returning, lea&s;t their pre&s;ence might be a re&s;traint. As &s;oon as the Captain left the room, they returned, and finding her &s;o much better, wi&s;hed her a good night, and left her with Lady Beauclair.</P>
<P>LOUISA ro&s;e with the &s;un, and &s;tole from her &s;i&s;ter, who had ju&s;t fallen in a

deep &s;leep. She went to the &s;aloon, where, as &s;he expected, &s;he met Capt. Bellmore, who had no more inclination for &s;leep than her&s;elf. "My dear Loui|&s;a," &s;aid he; "why will you ri&s;e &s;o ear|ly; you have no regard for your health." &mdash;"O!" I am quite well; you mu&s;t now tell me what has happened, I can|not bear this &s;u&s;pen&s;e." He then led her to a &s;ettee, and briefly related what the reader is already informed of. She heard him with a tolerable degree of compo&s;ure. "So," cried &s;he, with a &s;igh; when he concluded, "you had determined to obey him."&mdash;"But partly my love; could I expect my Loui&s;a would marry a beggar! &mdash;My determination was to go to India, and endeavour to acquire a competence, which, if I &s;ucceeded in, to return to you&mdash;if I failed&mdash;to die in a foreign country."</P>
<P>"COULD you con&s;ent to leave me?"
<PB N="169" REF="033744_0171_0FF910E4FA7D4FF8">
&s;aid &s;he, the tears &s;tarting from her eyes: "Ea&s;ily, my Loui&s;a," tenderly pre&s;&s;ing her to his bo&s;om; "Heaven knows the conflicts of my heart; your di&s;cerning eye perceived it. The tender manner in which you a&s;ked the cau&s;e, threw me off my guard, and I ab&s;olutely uttered words that &s;o much affected you: But, Oh! my Loui&s;a, to find my&s;elf &s;o dear to you, compen&s;ates for all I have met with."</P>
<P>JUST now Eliza entered, and rallied Loui&s;a &s;everely, for giving her the &s;lip. She imagined Capt. Bellmore had related his &s;tory to her, and was happy to &s;ee her &s;o compo&s;ed. They were &s;oon &s;um|moned to breakfa&s;t; Loui&s;a &s;eemed much confu&s;ed at meeting the re&s;t of the Family; but her indi&s;po&s;ition was &s;light|ly touched on; and the conver&s;ation changed to a different &s;ubject.</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair thought no time like
<PB N="170" REF="033744_0172_0FF910E9DB43C450">
the pre&s;ent, and went as &s;oon as dre&s;&s;ed, to wait on Mi&s;s Lovemore; he &s;ent up his name; &s;he had &s;een him, and had heard of his new acquired title, and flat|tered her&s;elf, his Lord&s;hip would be ad|ded to the train of her admirers, as &s;he had not heard of his marriage; &s;he kept him waiting &s;ome time, in order to add new lu&s;tre to her charms, by a prepo&s;|terous dre&s;s, rouge, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>SHE at la&s;t came &s;wimming into the room, with &s;uch an air, that his Lord&s;hip could with difficulty, keep his mu&s;cles in order. After &s;ome conver&s;ation, too trifling to relate, he mentioned Capt. Bellmore, and the connection which he heard was to take place. "O Lord," I hate the&s;e made up matches; I am cer|tain I &s;hall dete&s;t him, and my Father need not think I will ever con&s;ent to the match."</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="033744_0173_0FF910EE92D22550">LORD Beauclair &s;aid he was happy to &s;ee her &s;o aver&s;e to it, "for," added he, "the Captain, though he is a fine young man, is much too grave for you&mdash;a per|&s;on of your life and &s;pirits, would &s;uit much better with a man of the Bon Ton." "You do me honour, my Lord, "I a&s;&s;ure you I will never marry Capt. Bellmore; I can't abide the thought of a hu&s;band, who&s;e grave looks would al|ways be giving one le&s;&s;ons of morality; they tell me, he does not touch cards." O no, Madam; when he is from the re|giment, he &s;pends his time in reading, and writing love-&s;onnets on the favourite of his heart, or perhaps, &s;pending a &s;ocial hour where cards and &s;candal are perhaps never thought of."&mdash;"Oh! heaven de|fend me from &s;uch a hu&s;band," cried &s;he, with an affected laugh; "I &s;hall give him a po&s;itive refu&s;al, the fir&s;t time he comes."&mdash;"Upon my word, Madam, if that is your intention, I think you had
<PB N="172" REF="033744_0174_0FF910F05FE9A5B0">
better put an end to this affair, by writ|ing to him; and by &s;o doing, bring it to a more &s;peedy conclu&s;ion; as the young man, after having the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, and finding you &s;o fa&s;cinating, may not &s;o readily re&s;ign you."</P>
<P>"OH! you have hit it," &s;aid &s;he, "I will po&s;itively write to him. I told Pa|pa ye&s;terday, I was determined not to marry him, unle&s;s he would purcha&s;e him a title; but I knew the old gentle|man was too fond of his money to do that. Will you do me the honour, Ma|dam, to be the bearer of the letter?"</P>
<P>SHE con&s;ented, and flew to write; but &s;he &s;oon returned, and pre&s;ented a letter to his Lord&s;hip, though he had &s;aid no|thing to make her imagine him her lover. She &s;eemed much di&s;appointed, when he took leave; &s;he, however, comforted
<PB N="173" REF="033744_0175_0FF910F5C2D62A70">
her&s;elf, with the thought of &s;oon &s;eeing him again.</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair returned in high &s;pi|rits, and delivered the letter to Capt. Bellmore, who read as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have, no doubt, heard that our fathers have very wi&s;ely de&s;igned a match between us; as I am entirely aver&s;e to it, I hope you will not give your&s;elf the trouble to wait on me; as my deter|mination is fixed, I beg you will not urge any thing to alter it; I never can, or will, be any thing more to you, than</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your humble &s;ervant, JULIA LOVEMORE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="033744_0176_0FF910F8132B9F90">THE Captain folded him in his arms, and called him his guardian angel; he flew to Loui&s;a with the welcome intelli|gence. Lord Beauclair then related their conver&s;ation, which afforded a great deal of diver&s;ion; the next day Capt. Bellmore &s;et off for his Father's. When he arrived, Sir John was out; his Mother and Si&s;ter, flew to welcome him; are you returned to make us happy, &s;aid they; "I hope &s;o, Madam," returned he. He then &s;hewed his Mother the letter; at that in&s;tant, Sir John entered; "well, William," &s;aid he, "are you re|turned to a &s;en&s;e of your duty." He made no an&s;wer, but put the letter in his hand; he frowned: "damned non|&s;en&s;e," cried he? "what are her whims, to Sir Danvers and my engagements?" "what a life do you think Sir, two per|&s;ons &s;o aver&s;e to each other could lead; be&s;ides, I have heard Sir Danvers will not thwart his daughter's inclinations."
<PB N="175" REF="033744_0177_0FF910FCC003EFD0">
Well, well, if Sir Danvers has a mind to let this fooli&s;h girl rule him, I am willing to let it drop."</P>
<P>AUGUSTA had told Lady Bellmore, of her brother's attachment to Mi&s;s Vil|lars, and that, it was more than proba|ble &s;he would have a genteel fortune; Lady Bellmore had mentioned it to Sir John, which was the rea&s;on he was &s;o ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to relinqui&s;h his fa|vourite &s;cheme. A few days after Sir John called the Captain to his &s;tudy, and que&s;tioned him, with regard to his affections for Mi&s;s Villars; and pretend|ed to be angry at his engaging his affec|tions without his knowledge; he a&s;ked him, what her fortune would be;&mdash; in this he could not &s;atisfy him, but told him it would be &s;omething very hand&s;ome. Sir John &s;aid, Sir Danvers had wrote to him, and begged to be off, which he had agreed to; and if he
<PB N="176" REF="033744_0178_0FF910FFD4F6B300">
liked Mi&s;s Villars's fortune, he would have no objection to the match. That he &s;hould go to London, and he would call on her Father.</P>
<P>AFTER the Captain's departure from London, Lady Beauclair pre&s;ented Mr. Villars a deed for twenty thou&s;and pounds, for Loui&s;a's fortune; ten to be paid on the day of her marriage, and the other ten at her death; &s;aying, &s;he made no doubt, but her grand&s;on would add to it if it was required.</P>
<P>Mr. VILLARS was thinking her in terms &s;he merited, when &s;he interupted him, &s;aying, "the only compen&s;ation I can make for what you have &s;uffered, is to make you and your children happy.</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair, who had been made acquainted with Lady Beauclair's genero|&s;ity, added ten thou&s;and pounds more to
<PB N="177" REF="033744_0179_0FF90D8E4B2823E0">
Loui&s;a's fortune; and a few days after, Sir John arrived, and was &s;o plea&s;ed with Loui&s;a, that he was as eager for the match, as he before had been again&s;t it.</P>
<P>HE returned and told his Son, he might go and &s;ee his little blue-eyed girl as &s;oon as he plea&s;ed, that he liked her very well. The now happy Captain flew on the wings of love.&mdash;Mr. Villars receiv|ed him with open arms.&mdash;"Welcome, my dear Bellmore," cried he, let me now have the plea&s;ure of making my children happy. "So &s;aying, he led him to Loui&s;a, who, blu&s;hing, ro&s;e to receive him." "God ble&s;s you both," &s;aid he, joining their hands, "and may you meet with the reward of your merits."</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair pre&s;&s;ed his friend to his bo&s;om, &s;aying, "my dear, dear Wil|liam, &s;hall I be &s;o happy as to call you Brother."&mdash;In le&s;s than a month, the
<PB N="178" REF="033744_0180_0FF911063B4B2F18">
marriage was &s;olemnized, to the general &s;atisfaction of their friend; and Mi&s;s Bellmore for a time, forgot her own &s;or|rows, in the joy &s;he felt at &s;eeing her Brother happy.</P>
<P>A FEW days after, the whole family went to &s;pend &s;ome time at the grove.</P>
<P>AFTER they returned to London; and the ceremony of vi&s;iting was over, Mr. Villars and his family, retired to a beau|tiful little retreat, Lord Beauclair had purcha&s;ed for them nigh Hampton-Hall. Lord and Lady Beauclair continued with the old Lady, and &s;pent their &s;ummers with her in the country.</P>
<P>CAPT. Bellmore went to live at Union-Park, (a &s;eat which his Father had pre|&s;ented him on his marriage) about five miles from the Hall. He gave up his commi&s;&s;ion, and re&s;ided wholly in the
<PB N="179" REF="033744_0181_0FF9110AE6416178">
country: ble&s;&s;ed with his Loui&s;a, his happine&s;s was complete, and joy beam|ed around. Lady Beauclair lived to an advanced age, honoured by her children.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. VILLARS, in their de|cline of life, enjoyed every felicity. Ble&s;&s;ed in &s;eeing their children happy, their every wi&s;h was complete.</P>
<P>THEIR &s;ons, Edward and Charles, re|turned from the univer&s;ity, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every manly grace and virtue.</P>
<P>LORD and Lady Beauclair, already ble&s;&s;ed with two fine boys and a girl, live beloved by their friends, and adored by their dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>Mr. SOMMERS in a few years returned to England, and &s;ettled in their neigh|bourhood.&mdash;The lively Caroline, who&s;e beauty was much improved, made an

impre&s;&s;ion on the youthful heart of Ed|ward Villars, which ended in a happy marriage.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s BELLMORE was united to the man of her heart, who returned from In|dia, with a fortune equal to the mo&s;t mercenary wi&s;h of Sir John.&mdash;Mrs. Car|ley grew old in the &s;ervice of the Family, and found friends in every branch of it; &s;he latterly attached her&s;elf to the little daughter of Loui&s;a; and in the decline
of life, received the reward of her fidel|ity.</P>
