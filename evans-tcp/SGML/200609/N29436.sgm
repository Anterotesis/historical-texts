<HEAD>LAMENTATIONS Upon the never enough bewailed Death of the Reverend Mr. John Reiner, <HI>Pastor of the Church of Christ at Dover who was gathered to his Fathers</HI> DECEMBER, 21. 1676.</HEAD>
<L>WHen <HI>Heathen</HI> first assail'd our peaceful Land</L>
<L>My Comfort was, ours is <HI>Immanuels</HI> Land.</L>
<L>When <HI>Robbers</HI> us impov'risht thought I then</L>
<L>We may be poorer and not worser men.</L>
<L>I hope't when our young men i'th' field fell down</L>
<L>God brake our Arm of flesh to bare his own.</L>
<L>When treach'rous Foes did with success out-brave us</L>
<L>I said God meant to humble us, then save us.</L>
<L>But when that doleful word <HI>REINER is dead,</HI></L>
<L>I heard, Lips quiver'd, Belly trembled,</L>
<L>My Spirits fail'd, Corruption seiz'd my Bones,</L>
<L>My Face grew pale, my heart as cold as Stones:</L>
<L>Mee thought I saw engraven on this Rod</L>
<L>Plain to be read that fatal <HI>Ichabod.</HI></L>
<L>This single Death I count more wrath discovers</L>
<L>Then the removal of some hundred others.</L>
<L>Here's Anger great, Displeasure boiled up,</L>
<L>And that's the Gall and Wormwood in our Cup.</L>
<L>By former blasts our Leaves and Boughs did fall,</L>
<L>This terrible gust hath blown up Roots and all.</L>
<L>Some smarting Wounds we had receiv'd before,</L>
<L>This lays us welt'ring in our Blood and Gore,</L>
<L>Under the fifth Rib struck; you that pass by</L>
<L>Stand still and see, and sigh to see us dye.</L>
<L>Some of us saw of late our Houses burning,</L>
<L>Gods House lies waste now, High-way thither mourning,</L>
<L>Sanct'ary-doors shut up, a Famine not</L>
<L>of Bread, but Bread of Life's our threatned Lot.</L>
<L>How many hath this Right'ous Mans Lips fed,</L>
<L>Who now must pine, 'cause no man breaks them Bread?</L>
<L>So much as Heav'n exceeds the Earth, so far</L>
<L>As Souls than Bodies more excelling are,</L>
<L>So much is this more then our former wo,</L>
<L>These Iron Bands our Souls have piere't into.</L>
<L>What ever other ailes upon us were</L>
<L>Had God been pleased but to spare us here</L>
<L>Our Bread and Water of affliction would</L>
<L>Been less afflictive far, Oh that we could</L>
<L>Our Teacher see! but that sight of our eyes</L>
<L>Is gone, and He close in a corner lies.</L>
<L>Sure God a way for further Anger makes</L>
<L>When such a Man out of the way he takes.</L>
<L>In's latest Text too true a Prophet found, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"></L>

<L>A precious Soul he was, not old but sage,</L>
<L>Grave, wise and prudent far above his age,</L>
<L>Chearful but serious, merry too but wise</L>
<L>(Sour Leven pleases not for Sacrifice)</L>
<L>His Courtesie obliged most and best,</L>
<L>His Innocence did stop the Mouths o'th'rest.</L>
<L>In Supplications mighty, fervent, bold</L>
<L>Like <HI>Jacob</HI> he with confidence took hold</L>
<L>Of God in Prayer, wrestling with him till</L>
<L>He wrestling got the name of <HI>Israel.</HI></L>
<L>(Ah such a <HI>Moses</HI> we shall dearly miss</L>
<L>I'th Mount; when <HI>Amalek</HI> a fighting is)</L>
<L>His Sermons were Experiences, first wrought</L>
<L>On his own Heart, then lived what he taught.</L>
<L>He blameless was, unless you blame him shall</L>
<L>Because he was well spoken of by all.</L>
<L>His Life desir'd, his Death bewail'd you see</L>
<L>(Lord let our last end like the Righteous be)</L>
<L>A faithful Friend, plain-open-hearted he,</L>
<L>His words and heart in one did well agree.</L>
<L>Study what should or we would wish to be,</L>
<L>And say 'twas here, fear no Hyperbole.</L>

<L>Heart full, eyes full, too full themselves to vent</L>
