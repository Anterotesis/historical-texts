<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SEVERAL Members of the General Assembly having declared, that the appoint|ment of Delegates, to meet in the next Continental Congress, had better come from the people, than from their House; they having drawn up a list of grie|vances, similar to those contained in the proceedings of the Continental Con|gress, and intending also to petition the King on our behalf; have left this im|portant matter to your nomination.&mdash;The Chairman, Mr. Isaac Low, with the unanimous voice of your Committee, have thought proper, to call you together on Monday next, to take your sentiments, on the best method of choosing such Delegates.</P>
<P>You cannot be insensible of the many stratagems, made use of by the ministerial tools among us, <HI>To divide, and then destroy;</HI> as is evident in the hand bill, signed John Thurman, in which it appears, they have nothing else in view, than to postpone this important matter, until it will be too late to appoint any Delegates; for they would leave it until the 20th of April, from which delay, the time will be too short to take the sense of the counties on this subject, as there will then be but twenty days left, until the tenth of May, the day, on which the Continental Congress are to meet at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Rouze therefore, my dear Fellow Citizens! and spurn with indignation at their treache|rous purposes&mdash;Their insinuation, that the day is too short, for your consideration, is an insult upon your understandings: All of our sister colonies, have already chosen their Delegates, and shall we delay concurring in a measure, that has been the subject of consideration, ever since the last Congress?</P>
<P>You cannot be ignorant, that if we do not appoint Delegates, all the Colonies will, and must withhold their trade and connection from us; whereby, as our late respectable Delegates assert, we shall not only act a dishonourable part, but our debt due from them will remain unpaid; we shall be destitute of many necessaries which we now receive from them, and the next Congress may be induced to enter into Measures against u<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">, for our perfidy. <HI>In our Union, we have every thing to expect; in Disunion, Ruin and Destruction.</HI> I entertain not the smallest doubt, but on this day, you will discover to these Seek|ers of court favours, that we are not to be cajoled out of our inestimable and <HI>con|stitutional privileges,</HI> by such <HI>contemptible pretexts.</HI>&mdash;Consider who these people are, who thus darkly advise, and you will soon find their drift is to enslave this free and happy Country, in order to obtain Pensions and Places for themselves and sons. If ever we are taxed by a venal British Parliament, these very persons will be our tax-masters, whilst unhappy for us, we shall be little better than beasts of burthen; and, by the sweat of our brows, support them in luxury and iniquity.&mdash;And the severity of this more than cruel burthen, will be most heavy on the <HI>industrious poor.</HI> The eyes of all America are now upon us,&mdash;let us acquit ourselves like men, deserving the glo|rious cause for which we contend&mdash;We have already chosen a respectable and ap|proved <HI>Committee;</HI> as such, let us strenuously support them in the measures they have adopted, and frustrate the wicked attempts of our enemies.</P>
