<P>Excu&s;e me, my Lord; whatever joy I might feel at my return to this much lov'd &s;pot, is damp'd by the reflection of what may have been occa&s;ion'd by my own imprudence.

<SPEAKER>Young Lat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord; there is a wide difference between ri&s;king one's life in the cau&s;e of humanity, and &s;itting down calmly, the &s;port of unmerited misfortune. Was it my fault, that I was born of parents inferior, in point of affluence, to my Valence's?
