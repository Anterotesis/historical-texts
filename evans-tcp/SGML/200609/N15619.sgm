<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IMPROVEMENT in Elocution, for a &s;elect number of &s;tudents, at a public &s;chool, was one principal de&s;ign of the author, when he began the following piece.&mdash;How far he &s;ucceeded in that de&s;ign, mu&s;t be left to tho&s;e who are ac|quainted with the circum&s;tances to judge&mdash;And how far he may now &s;ucceed in gaining the approbation of the public, time mu&s;t determine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doubtle&s;s, tho&s;e who are profe&s;&s;ed enemies to the Drama, in whatever garb it may appear, if they pay any attention to this, will wholly condemn it;&mdash;and perhaps, tho&s;e who are friendly to performances of the kind, and judges of their merit, not without rea&s;on, will do the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Should the moro&s;e, uncandid Critic, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ts on the faults, and follies of others, be at lei&s;ure, and not think this piece be|neath his notice, he may on a &s;light examination, find it a very proper, and &s;alutary mor&s;el, ju&s;t to alleviate the cravings of his voracious appetite, till he can meet with &s;omething more &s;ub|&s;tantial to feed upon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The author's mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, have never led him to expect that this performance would e&s;cape the attack of the Critic, any other way, than by his &s;uppo&s;ing it unworthy his notice, and therefore turning his exertions to &s;ome other perfor|mances of more merit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Tis allowed that the motives of Theatrical performances, ought, by &s;triking repre&s;entations, to hold up Virtue, or vir|tuous actions, in a beautiful point of light&mdash;and, to repre&s;ent Vice in its mo&s;t odious colours, and vicious actions meeting condign puni&s;hment:&mdash;So far as the&s;e motives, or the effects of them are inverted, 'tis generally allowed that performances of this kind become detrimental. How far this rule is adherea to in the following pages, mu&s;t be determined by the judgment of tho&s;e who peru&s;e them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="019922_0003_0FAD44C306145DB0">
<HI>The &s;ubject is what every per&s;on, in the United States, ar|rived to years of under&s;tanding, is well acquainted with; and a &s;ubject, in which every one, in the time the tran&s;actions referred to took place, thought them&s;elves deeply intere&s;ted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It will perhaps be &s;aid, that a performance of this kind if ever proper and &s;uitable, would have been much more &s;o, ju&s;t at the clo&s;e of the war, when the&s;e matters were fre&s;h in the minds of all; but that now, there is no propriety in it, &s;ince other matters mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have occupied the minds of peo|ple; while the former, are almo&s;t obliterated.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This objection, if it be one, was a principal motive which induced the author to publi&s;h the piece.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is well known that the e&s;timate we &s;et on what we po&s;&s;e&s;s, is in a great mea&s;ure proportion'd to the arduous exer|tions we have made u&s;e of in obtaining it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a man by a perilous undertaking, and the mo&s;t painful &s;truggles, at the ri&s;que of his life and property, has obtained a valuable prize, &s;o long at lea&s;t, as the danger to which he was expo&s;ed, and the earne&s;t efforts he made in the acqui&s;ition are fre&s;h in his memory, we may be &s;ure he will carefully pre&s;erve and defend it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ought we not to e&s;teem mo&s;t &s;acredly, that freedom and in|dependence &s;ecur'd to us by the late important revolution?&mdash;Ought we ever to forget tho&s;e arduous, tho&s;e bloody &s;truggles we endured in that dangerous conte&s;t?&mdash;a conte&s;t in which thou&s;ands of our dear friends yielded up their lives on the &s;an|guine plains. And &s;hall we, who are enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings for which they fought 'till their la&s;t breath, forget to celebrate tho&s;e tran&s;actions?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ought we not, on the other hand, ever to bear them on our minds, and endeavour to impre&s;s on the minds of the ri&s;ing generation, the ine&s;timable value of the liberties they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the dangerous &s;truggles their predece&s;&s;ors endured to &s;ecure to them tho&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings?</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e con&s;iderations, with that of the improvement of youth
<PB N="5" REF="019922_0004_0FAD44C444B82CF8">
in Elocution, fir&s;t induced the author to choo&s;e this &s;ubject, and have now induced him to pre&s;ent this little performance to the public.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He is &s;en&s;ible that he has not pur&s;ued the common mode of procedure in Theatrical performances&mdash;nor was that his in|tention:&mdash;'Tis hoped however, that the candid will over-look many imperfections, when they con&s;ider the great difficulty of bringing a &s;ubject &s;o copious and exten&s;ive, into the narrow limits nece&s;&s;ary for a performance of this kind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The real characters here repre&s;ented under fictitious names, are left for the readers to apply.&mdash;Many important tran&s;|actions during the war, are wholly omitted, and only &s;ome, and tho&s;e very few of the mo&s;t important, ju&s;t glanced at:&mdash;Had this not been the ca&s;e, the piece would have &s;welled far beyond the &s;ize of a common pamphlet,&mdash;which was not intended.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To conclude this preface, already much too long;&mdash;the piece, &s;ome what &s;ingular of its kind, and doubtle&s;s containing many inaccuracies, is now, with a &s;olicitation of candour, pre|&s;ented to the public, by one who will ever e&s;teem it his duty, and highe&s;t happine&s;s to promote the welfare of his country.</HI></P>
