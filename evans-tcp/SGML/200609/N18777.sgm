<HEAD>TO THE PUBLISHER OF THE PENNSYLVANIA MAGAZINE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS much plea&s;ed when I heard of your in|tention to publi&s;h a Magazine o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Monthly Mi&s;cella|ny. For you mu&s;t know, Mr. Aitken, that I have long had an earne&s;t de&s;ire to appear as an author before the re&s;pectable public. When I walk out a|lone, which I frequently do, ob&s;ervations and &s;enti|ments ari&s;e in my mind, which appear to me as wi&s;e and important as many of tho&s;e which the pre&s;s is continually obtruding upon the public notice.</P>
<P>TRUE it is, I have never yet been able to collect
<PB N="2" REF="024407_0006_0FC70B0E68E68CF0">
a &s;ufficient number of the&s;e bright ideas to form a regular piece of compo&s;ition: but I had great hopes, that if a proper occa&s;ion &s;hould offer, I might be able to furni&s;h a &s;hort e&s;&s;ay upon &s;ome &s;ubject or other.</P>
<P>YOU may wonder, perhaps, why I have not tri|ed my hand in &s;ome of the public new&s;papers; but the truth is, that what with your <HI>Citizens,</HI> your <HI>Philadelphians,</HI> your <HI>Lovers of Liberty,</HI> your <HI>Mode|rate Men,</HI> and your <HI>Immoderate Men,</HI> there is no getting a word or two in, edge-ways, among&s;t them. Now, I look upon your propo&s;ed magazine as a plea&s;ant little path, where a man may take an agreeable walk with a few orderly and agreeable friends, without the danger of being jo&s;tled to death in a crowd.</P>
<P>I DETERMINED, therefore, to make my appear|ance in your fir&s;t number; and, for this purpo&s;e, I &s;at whole hours alone in my chamber: I took &s;olitary walks, and implored every mu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t me.&mdash;But all in vain.&mdash;Tho&s;e hard-hearted god|de&s;&s;es were deaf to my earne&s;t invocations, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to attend me, either in their bet|termo&s;t &s;uits of flowing rhyme, or in their common dre&s;s of home-&s;pun pro&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="024407_0007_0FC70B102BB85260">THE fir&s;t important difficulty I met with was the choice of a &s;ubject; much fruitle&s;s time was wa&s;ted in this pur&s;uit. The whole train of &s;ciences pa&s;&s;ed in review before me; I cho&s;e, and rejected, my choice; I determined, and altered lay determi|nation; &s;o many enticing objects courted my atten|tion, that fancy hovered over them like a bird, un|determined where to &s;ettle.</P>
<P>Having, one evening, wearied my&s;elf with this mental exerci&s;e, I retired to re&s;t. During the &s;i|lent hours of night, when the powers of my &s;oul, no longer &s;ubjected to the directions of my will, were re&s;igned to the influences of the &s;piritual world, I was entertained with the following very EXTRAORDINARY DREAM.</P>
<P>I FOUND my&s;elf in a place where a thick fog &s;urrounded me, and &s;creened every object from my view. The exerted powers of vi&s;ion could extend no farther than a few yards round me.</P>
<P>AT length I perceived a den&s;e and &s;utty cloud, gradually de&s;cend and re&s;t before me. I attended its motions with earne&s;t application. I ob&s;erved that it boiled in circling eddies, and laboured with in|te&s;tine conflict; it bur&s;t with a peal of thunder, and
<PB N="4" REF="024407_0008_0FC70B15EDBFF9A0">
vani&s;hed in thin air: and I &s;aw an angelic form of exqui&s;ite beauty &s;tanding before me. She was clad in flowing robes, white as the new fallen &s;now, and was inve&s;ted with an atmo&s;phere of lambent glory. She addre&s;&s;ed me in words to this effect:
<Q>Happy art thou, oh mortal! and highly favoured in this interview! I am TRUTH; and as thou art in the earne&s;t pur&s;uit of knowledge, I am come to impre&s;s upon thy mind, by &s;en&s;ible objects, a comprehen&s;ive view of human wi&s;dom.</Q>
Say|ing this, &s;he waved her right hand, and the fog di&s;per&s;ed. I then perceived that I was &s;tanding on a beautiful eminence, which commanded an unin|terrupted view of a very exten&s;ive garden. Three &s;ides of this garden were bounded by a lofty and &s;ub&s;tantial wall; the fourth was wa&s;hed by the wa|ters of the ocean.</P>
<P><Q>WHAT thou &s;ee&s;t before thee, (&s;aid my divine companion,) <HI>is the garden of human knowledge.</HI> It is &s;urrounded by a high wall, becau&s;e the wi&s;|dom of finite beings mu&s;t be finite; and it lies on the banks of the ocean of <HI>eternity.</HI> You may ob&s;erve, that it has but one gate, leading into a long and narrow <HI>path,</HI> on which nothing grows but a few nutritious fruits and &s;alutary herbs. After this, innumerable walks and alleys branch
<PB N="5" REF="024407_0009_0FC70B181F2B37B0">
out, directing to the &s;everal departments of the garden.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I SEE your eyes are fixed upon that remarka|ble tree in the middle of this &s;pacious garden. It does indeed make a very &s;ingular appearance now; but it was once the glory of the whole &s;cene. It is the tree of <HI>religion,</HI> and its fruit is the mo&s;t delicious and &s;alutary that can be found in the whole garden. The folly of mankind hath reduced it to the deplorable &s;ituation in which you now &s;ee it. Some thought its branches were too large, and &s;pread too far: and le&s;t their &s;hade &s;hould &s;tint the growth of the paltry weeds they had planted under them, they lopt off many of them clo&s;e to the &s;tock. Others, on the con|trary, concluded that, as it was &s;o beneficial a tree, there could not be too much of it, and therefore permitted the &s;uckers to grow round its roots; and moreover, brought cions from other trees and grafted them on the &s;tock. Some learned botani&s;ts in&s;i&s;ted that all the virtues of this tree were contained in the fruit, and would have all the leaves &s;tripped off, as being of no u&s;e; whil&s;t others, as learned, contended, that if the leaves were pre&s;erved, it &s;ignified nothing whether it bore fruit or not. Thus by their &s;e|veral <HI>&s;y&s;tems</HI> and <HI>improvements,</HI> they would re|duce
<PB N="6" REF="024407_0010_0FC70B19A5D0B9A0">
it to a mutilated, u&s;ele&s;s, and deformed trunk.</Q></P>
<P><Q>TURN your attention now to yonder labyrinth. That is the LAW department in the garden of knowledge. In the centre &s;tands an elegant &s;tatue of <HI>Ju&s;tice:</HI> but the ways that lead to it are &s;o intricate, and the paths &s;o narrow and inter|woven with each other, that by the time tho&s;e who reach it have got half through the puzzle, they become more anxious to find their way back than to proceed. For you mu&s;t know, that the alleys are formed by &s;tone walls and wooden fences &s;tuck full with nails and tenter-hooks; &s;o that, if the bold adventurer &s;hould even reach the &s;tatue, he gets there in a mo&s;t ragged, and, &s;ometimes, naked condition. Moreover, the en|trances to all the&s;e paths and alleys were much encumbered with weeds, bru&s;h, and thorns; but a celebrated modern <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone.</NOTE> hath taken the pains to clear away a great deal of the rubbi&s;h, and has drawn a plan of the &s;everal windings and intrica|cies of this labyrinth for the benefit of mankind, yet the tenter-hooks remain in the walls as nume|rous as ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>YONDER large department is the di&s;trict of
<PB N="7" REF="024407_0011_0FC70B1C143C5410">
PHYSIC. It abounds, indeed, with a great varie|ty of medicinal herbs and plants; but the mi&s;|fortune is, that the mi&s;application of their powers and qualities by un&s;kilful pretenders, hath been the &s;ource of much mi&s;ery to mankind. Add to this, that the affectation of pomp and my&s;tery, and the fopperies of fa&s;hion, have too frequently rendered this important branch of knowledge ridiculous in the eye of truth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT &s;ecluded corner,
<L>'Dark with the cedar grove;</L>
<L>'Where fragrant &s;pices bloom,</L>
<L>'And amorous turtles love</L>
<L>'Beneath the plea&s;ing gloom,'</L>
is devoted to the fine arts, PAINTING, POETRY, MUSIC, &amp;c. It was once enriched with a great profu&s;ion of fruits and flowers of exqui&s;ite &s;cent and varied hues: but the&s;e have long &s;ince been gathered by the arti&s;ts of former days. It is kept, however, in neat order, and furni&s;hes many gay garlands and agreeable no&s;egays. It mu&s;t be owned too, that a modern poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shake&s;peare.</NOTE> cultivated here a number of flowers and ever-greens, with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024407_0012_0FC70B2711F45810">HERE I interrupted my kind in&s;tructor, by a&s;k|ing, what that &s;trange looking place, near the walls of the garden, might &s;ignify.</P>
<P><Q>THAT place, (&s;aid &s;he) is a &s;wamp, overgrown with briars and thorns. It is the department of LOGIC; and the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s and untoward &s;pot in the whole garden of knowledge. Neverthe|le&s;s, there are not wanting &s;ome who take delight in cultivating it. You &s;ee what odd nooks and angles form the outward boundaries; and the in|ternal parts are al&s;o cut by a thou&s;and crooked paths, turning and winding, dividing and &s;ubdi|viding, and all to no purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE proprietors of this &s;wamp have, in vain, endeavoured to drain it, as it lies lower than all the neighbouring ground. They have, however, &s;omewhat improved it by &s;hutting up the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s paths, and throwing bridges and cau&s;e-ways over the mar&s;hy places. They have been plea&s;ed to dedicate their labours to me; but I &s;hould be &s;orry if any of my votaries &s;hould &s;o far mi&s;pend their time, as to &s;eek for me amid&s;t the trifling intricacies of that barren place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NEAR to this &s;wamp you &s;ee METAPHYSICS; but this department lies &s;o clo&s;e to the wall
<PB N="9" REF="024407_0013_0FC70B28BAD59D70">
which bounds all human knowledge, and is &s;o &s;hadowed thereby, that it produces very few plants who&s;e virtues can be depended upon. The labourers in this ground are continually endea|vouring to make peep-holes through the wall, by which they may di&s;cover the adjacent country: but the materials of which that wall is made are too hard to yield to any tools they can work with.</Q></P>
<P>HERE my divine in&s;tructor turned to me, and &s;aid:
<Q>I would willingly point out to you the &s;itu|ation and de&s;tination of all the other parts of the garden; but I perceive that by the natural cour&s;e of your con&s;titution, your &s;pirit will &s;oon be again &s;ubject to your will, and of con&s;equence plunged in the vortex of the bu&s;y world. I ha&s;ten, therefore, to communicate to you &s;ome very important intelligence, re&s;pecting both the &s;piritual and material kingdoms. Truths be|yond the reach of human inve&s;tigation, which will tend to enlarge your mind, and give you the mo&s;t exalted ideas of the Omnipotent Author of nature.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ALL that exten&s;ive part of the garden which is bounded by the ocean, is a&s;&s;igned for the &s;everal branches of NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. You may

ob&s;erve, that a great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">deal of it is beneficially cul|tivated, but much the greate&s;t part of it remains yet unexplored. By the &s;tudy of natural philo|&s;ophy and a&s;tronomy men acquire &s;ome know|ledge of the oeconomy of the <HI>Great Supreme.</HI> In &s;ome in&s;tances demon&s;tration and fact confirm the truths di&s;covered; but, in others, fanciful hypothe&s;es are &s;ub&s;tituted for truth, and errors become &s;anctified by &s;y&s;tem, and habitual by edu|cation. My pre&s;ent de&s;ign is to remove &s;ome of the&s;e prejudices from your mind, and to en|rich your under&s;tanding with <HI>true philo&s;ophy.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"KNOW, then, and ob&s;erve it well, that"&mdash;At this in&s;tant, my &s;ervant knocked at my chamber-door, and told me that the barber waited for me. Think, Mr. Aitken, what a mortifica|tion it was to me to be &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably interrupted, when I was ju&s;t going to receive the &s;ecrets of na|ture from the lips of truth. In&s;tead of conver&s;ing further with that divine per&s;onage, I was obliged to attend the impatience of Mon&s;. le Fri&s;eur; who, without ceremony began to &s;meer my face with na&s;ty &s;oap-&s;uds. I heartily wi&s;hed him in the ocean of eternity.</P>

<HEAD>For the Penn&s;ylvania Magazine. AN IMPROVED PLAN OF EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few objects in life of greater im|portance than the proper culture and in&s;truc|tion of tho&s;e who mu&s;t in time &s;upply the places of the pre&s;ent generation.</P>
<P>VERY arduous is the ta&s;k of education, both to the indu&s;trious teacher and his a&s;&s;iduous di&s;ciples. What thanks then will be due to him who &s;hall contribute any thing towards rendering the road to &s;cience ea&s;y and plea&s;ant, or &s;horten the tedious length of the journey.</P>
<P>MANY &s;chemes have been formed by ingenious men for this good purpo&s;e, in which they have endeavoured to blend the <HI>utile</HI> with the <HI>dulce,</HI> in &s;o intimate a connection, that the pupil becomes in&s;en&s;ibly in&s;tructed, whil&s;t he thinks he is only a|mu&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AS I am quite di&s;po&s;ed to allow every per&s;on the prai&s;e due to his ingenuity, I readily acknow|ledge the u&s;efulne&s;s of their &s;everal devices: &s;uch
<PB N="13" REF="024407_0017_0FC70B3335545418">
as teaching <HI>geography</HI> by maps pa&s;ted on thin boards, and cut into pieces, according to the divi|&s;ions of counties or kingdoms: <HI>commerce,</HI> by a te-to-tum: <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>chronology,</HI> by a pack of cards: and <HI>Euclid's elements,</HI> by figures cut out of box-wood, with many other &s;imilar inventions, by which &s;cience is planted in the minds of youth by the fair hand of innocent plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE improvement I have made on this idea, ap|pears to me &s;o important, that I cannot forbear of|fering it to the public for general u&s;e; heartily re|commending my plan to the tru&s;tees of our college, and to the patronage of the legi&s;lature. I have, here|in, not only united in&s;truction with delight, but added al&s;o the invaluable ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>health</HI>; making the&s;e de&s;ireable acqui&s;itions to go hand in hand, mutually improving and &s;trengthening both mind and body, by one amu&s;ing proce&s;s.</P>
<P>IN order to execute my plan, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to purcha&s;e about twenty acres of level ground, which mu&s;t be well cleared of all incumbrances; and, if laid out in a circular form, it may be called the <HI>whole circle of &s;ciences.</HI></P>
<P>TO begin with <HI>grammar,</HI> which co&s;ts the poor boys much trouble and painful attention: I beg

leave to quote a pa&s;&s;age from a late humorous no|vel; from which, I mu&s;t in ju&s;tice acknowledge, I took the hint of my improved plan of education. The pa&s;&s;age I allude to is this.</P>
<P>"HERE, <HI>Jackey,</HI> let the gentleman <HI>&s;ee</HI> you de|cline the pronoun article <HI>hic, haec, hoc.</HI> Ma&s;ter Jackey immediately began hopping about the room, repeating <HI>hic, haec, hoc;</HI> genitive, <HI>hujus,</HI> dative, <HI>huic;</HI> uccu&s;ative, <HI>hunc, haec, hoc;</HI> vocative, <HI>caret;</HI> ablative, <HI>hoc, haec hoc.</HI> There now, &s;ays <HI>Selkirk,</HI> in this manner I teach him the whole grammar.

<HEAD>CONSOLATION FOR THE OLD BACHELOR.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A paper, under the title of <HI>The Old Bachelor,</HI> had been in&s;ti|tuted in the Penn&s;ylvania Magazine.</NOTE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Aitken,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR <HI>Old Bachelor</HI> having pathetically re|pre&s;ented the mi&s;eries of his &s;olitary &s;ituation, &s;e|verely reproaching him&s;elf for having neglected to marry in his younger days; I would fain alle|viate his di&s;tre&s;s, by &s;hewing that it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> he might have been as unhappy&mdash;even in the honour|able &s;tate of matrimony.</P>
<P>I am a &s;hoemaker in this city, and by my indu&s;|try and attention have been enabled to maintain my wife and a daughter, now &s;ix years old, in comfort and re&s;pect; and to lay by a little at the year's end, again&s;t a rainy day.</P>
<P>MY good wife had long tea&s;ed me to take her to New York, in order to vi&s;it <HI>Mrs. Snip,</HI> the la|dy of an eminent taylor in that city, and her cou|&s;in; from whom &s;he had received many pre&s;&s;ing invitations.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="024407_0025_0FC70B4EE64FC128">THIS jaunt had been the daily &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion at breakfa&s;t, dinner, and &s;upper for a month before the time fixed upon for putting it in execu|tion. As our daughter <HI>Jenny</HI> could by no means be left at home, many and great were the prepa|tions to equip Mi&s;s and her Mamma for this impor|tant journey; and yet, as my wife a&s;&s;ured me, there was nothing provided but what was <HI>ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> and which we could not po&s;&s;ibly do without&mdash;My pur&s;e &s;weat at every pore.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, the long expected day arrived, preceded by a very re&s;tle&s;s night. For, as my wife could not &s;leep for thinking on the approaching jaunt, nei|ther would &s;he &s;uffer me to repo&s;e in quiet. If I happened through weari&s;omene&s;s to fall into a &s;lumber, &s;he immediately rou&s;ed me by &s;ome un|&s;ea&s;onable que&s;tion or remark: frequently a&s;k|ing if I was &s;ure the apprentice had grea&s;ed the chair-wheels, and &s;een that the harne&s;s was clean and in good order; often ob&s;erving how &s;urpri&s;ed her cou&s;in Snip would be to &s;ee us; and as often wondering how poor dear Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> would bear the fatigue of the journey&mdash;Thus pa&s;t the night in delightful di&s;cour&s;e, if that can with propriety be called a di&s;cour&s;e, wherein my wife was the only &s;peaker&mdash;my replies never exceeding the mo|no&s;yllables

<HI>yes</HI> or <HI>no,</HI> murmured between &s;leeping and waking.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner was it fair day-light, but up &s;tarted my notable wife, and &s;oon rou&s;ed the whole fami|ly. The little trunk was &s;tuffed with baggage, even to bur&s;ting, and tied behind the chair, and the chair-box was crammed with trumpery which <HI>we could not po&s;&s;ibly do without.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> was dre&s;t, and breakfa&s;t devoured in ha&s;te: the old ne|gro wench was called in, and the charge of the hou&s;e committed to her care; and the two appren|tices and the hired maid received many whole|&s;ome cautions and in&s;tructions for their conduct during our ab&s;ence, all which they mo&s;t liberally promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve; whil&s;t I attended, with infi|nite patience, the adju&s;tment of the&s;e preliminaries.</P>
<P>AT length, however, we &s;et off, and, turning the fir&s;t corner, lo&s;t &s;ight of our habitation, with great regret on my part, and no le&s;s joy on the part of Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> and her Mamma.</P>
<P>WHEN we got to Poole's Bridge, there hap|pened to be a great concour&s;e of waggons, carts, &amp;c. &s;o that we could not pa&s;s for &s;ome time&mdash; Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> frightened&mdash;my wife very impatient and unea&s;y&mdash;wondered I did not call out to tho&s;e

impudent fellows to make way for us; ob&s;erving that I had not the &s;pirit of a lou&s;e. Having got through this difficulty, we proceeded without ob|&s;truction&mdash;my wife in good humour again&mdash;Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> in high &s;pirits.

Tea&s;ed and mortified as I was, my good wife admini&s;ter|ed con&s;olation by ob&s;erving,
<Q>That it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee that every thing was put into the chair that ought to be, but there was no depend|ing upon me for any thing; and that &s;he plainly &s;aw I undertoook this journey with an ill-will, merely becau&s;e &s;he had &s;et her heart upon it.</Q>
Silent patience was my only remedy. An hour and an half re&s;tored to us this e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite&mdash;the wire-cap, and brought us back to the place where we fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>AFTER innumerable difficulties and unparalleled dangers, occa&s;ioned by ruts, &s;tumps, and tremen|dous bridges, we arrived at Ne&s;hamony ferry: but
<PB N="24" REF="024407_0028_0FC70B57E09C34A0">
how to cro&s;s it was the que&s;tion. My wife pro|te&s;ted that neither &s;he nor <HI>Jenny</HI> would go over in the boat with the hor&s;e. I a&s;&s;ured her that there was not the lea&s;t danger; that the hor&s;e was as quiet as a dog, and that I would hold him by the bridle all the way. The&s;e a&s;&s;urances had little weight: the mo&s;t forcible argument was that &s;he mu&s;t go that way or not at all, for there was no other boat to be had. Thus per&s;uaded, &s;he ventured in&mdash;The flies were trouble&s;ome&mdash;the hor&s;e kicked&mdash;my wife in panics&mdash;Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> in tears.&mdash;<HI>Ditto</HI> at <HI>Trenton-ferry.</HI></P>
<P>AS we &s;tarted pretty early, and as the days were long, we reached Trenton by two o'clock. Here we dined. My wife found fault with every thing; and whil&s;t &s;he di&s;po&s;ed of what I thought a tolera|ble hearty meal, declared there was nothing fit to eat. Matters, however, would have gone on pret|ty well, but Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> began to cry with the tooth-ach&mdash;&s;ad lamentations over Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI>&mdash;all my fault, becau&s;e I had not made the glazier re|place a broken pane in her chamber window. N. B. I had been twice for him, and he promi&s;ed to come, but was not &s;o good as his word.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner we again entered upon our jour|ney&mdash;my wife in good humour&mdash;Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny's</HI>

We refre&s;h our&s;elves with tea, and go to bed early, in order to be up by times for the next day's expedition.</P>
<P>IN the morning we &s;et off again in tolerable good humour, and proceeded happily as far as <HI>Rocky-hill.</HI> Here my wife's fears and terrors re|turned with great force. I drove as carefully as po&s;&s;ible; but coming to a place where one of the wheels mu&s;t unavoidably go over the point of a &s;mall rock, my wife, in a great fright, &s;eized hold of one of the reins, which happening to be the wrong one, &s;he pulled the hor&s;e &s;o as to force the wheel higher up the rock than it would otherwi&s;e have gone, and over&s;et the chair.

<P>AFTER pa&s;&s;ing unhurt over the imminent dangers of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ayack</HI> and <HI>Hacken&s;ack</HI> rivers, and the yet more tremendous horrors of <HI>Pawlas-hook</HI> ferry, we arrived, at the clo&s;e of the third day, at cou|&s;in <HI>Snip's</HI> in the city of New York.</P>
<P>HERE we &s;ojourned a tedious week; my wife &s;pent as much money as would have maintained my family for a month at home, in purcha&s;ing a hundred u&s;ele&s;s articles <HI>which we could not po&s;&s;ibly do without;</HI> and every night when we went to bed fatigued me with encomiums on her cou&s;in <HI>Snip</HI>; leading to a hi&s;tory of the former grandeur of her family, and concluding with in&s;inuations that I did not treat her with the attention and re|&s;pect I ought.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="024407_0031_0FC70B64F0D59E10">ON the &s;eventh day my wife and cou&s;in <HI>Snip</HI> had a pretty warm altercation re&s;pecting the com|parative elegancies and advantages of New York and Philadelphia. The di&s;pute ran high, and ma|ny aggravating words pa&s;t between the two advo|cates. The next morning, my wife declared that my bu&s;ine&s;s would not admit of a longer ab&s;ence from home&mdash;and &s;o after much ceremonious com|plai&s;ance, in which my wife was by no means ex|ceeded by her very polite cou&s;in, we left the fa|mous city of New York; and I with heart-felt &s;atisfaction looked forward to the happy period of our &s;afe arrival in Water-&s;treet, Philadelphia.</P>
<P>BUT this ble&s;&s;ing was not to be obtained with|out much vexation and trouble&mdash;but le&s;t I &s;hould &s;eem tedious I &s;hall not recount the adventures of our return&mdash;how we were caught in a thunder &s;torm&mdash;how our hor&s;e failed, by which we were benighted three miles from our &s;tage&mdash;how my wife's panics returned&mdash;how Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny</HI> howled, and how very mi&s;erable I was made.

ran away with the hired-maid, no body knew where; the old negro had got drunk, fallen into the fire, and burnt out one of her eyes; and our be&s;t china-bowl was broken.</P>
<P>MY good wife contrived, with her u&s;ual inge|nuity, to throw the blame of all the&s;e misfortunes upon me. As this was a con&s;olation to which I had been long accu&s;tomed in all untoward ca&s;es, I had recour&s;e to my u&s;ual remedy, viz. &s;ilent pa|tience.

No elegy in ver&s;e or pro&s;e to celebrate the virtues I never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or palliate the faults I really had. Not even a para|graph in the new&s;paper to announce my departure &mdash;Yes&mdash;I had &s;ome comfort in &s;uppo&s;ing that my name might creep into the fag-end of your Maga|zine, under the li&s;t of deaths, with a declaration that I had charitably left my e&s;tate to the Penn&s;yl|vania Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>SUCH was the di&s;mal train of ideas that pre&s;ent|ed to my imagination. My di&s;order encrea&s;ed, my life was de&s;paired of. Some half a dozen &s;econd and third cou&s;ins came to &s;ee me. They di&s;gu&s;ted me with their officious and overacted kindne&s;&s;es. "Why did you not &s;end, my dear cou&s;in, to let

me know you was &s;ick?" "I never heard a word of it till this morning, and I came the moment I was informed of your danger." Says another,&mdash; "Do take this."&mdash;" Pray try that."&mdash;"There is nothing better for a fever, I have known it to do wonders." Another of my very loving cou&s;ins &s;at down by my bed&s;ide, and with a doleful coun|tenance began a lecture upon the uncertainty of life, and the certainty of death. After a few com|mon place ob&s;ervations he came to the point he had in view. "I hope, my dear cou&s;in, (&s;aid he) that you have &s;ettled your worldly affairs; your loving relations expect it of you; I hope you have made your will; the&s;e things had better not be delayed; it will be an ea&s;e to your mind when that nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s is over, and you will not die an hour the &s;ooner for having completed it. We all hope you may recover; God grant you may! But, as we are all mortal, and know not how &s;oon we may be called upon, it is prudent to pro|vide again&s;t the wor&s;t." I told him that my will was already made, and that I had no inclination to alter it. My cou&s;ins continued to tea&s;e me with unremitting cruelty; my &s;trength was &s;o exhau&s;ted that I could not &s;cold, &s;torm and &s;wear, as I wi&s;h|ed to do. I fretted inwardly; my phy&s;ician, too, was in league with my cou&s;ins; he denied me every thing I de&s;ired, and forced upon me every

thing I loathed and abhorred; my &s;ituation was truly deplorable. I earne&s;tly longed for a draught of cold water; I reque&s;ted it in terms of the mo&s;t pathetic &s;olicitation; but to no purpo&s;e.&mdash;At length I prevailed upon an old negro wench, who is not worth a farthing, and yet the mo&s;t valuable &s;ervant I have got, to bring me, privately, a tan|kard of water fre&s;h from the pump. I drank it off greedily. It threw me into a profu&s;e &s;weat and deep &s;leep&mdash;it &s;aved my life&mdash;I began to recover. No &s;ooner was I out of danger, but my loving cou|&s;ins, whom I had not &s;een for four years before my illne&s;s, left me with one con&s;ent: and it is more than probable, that they will not vi&s;it me again for four years to come&mdash;Heaven grant they may not!

<P>&mdash;I might have &s;at in my elbow chair till doom&s;|day, and revolved the matter over and over again, till my brain had become as dry as a box of Scotch &s;nuff.

<P>BUT the accident, which occa&s;ioned this ex|traordinary revolution, is worth relating&mdash;</P>
<P>I acquainted you in a former letter, with my ill|ne&s;s and recovery. For the better e&s;tabli&s;hment of my health, exerci&s;e and air were much recom|mended. I made it a practice, therefore, when|ever the weather was &s;uitable, to walk two or three miles before dinner. One day, as I was taking my u&s;ual excur&s;ion along the road that leads to the lower ferry on Schulkyl, two women pa&s;&s;ed me in a chair. The younge&s;t of the two drew the attention of a momentary glance. I thought I &s;aw &s;omething in her that made me wi&s;h for a longer view. They had not proceeded above an hun|dred yards when their hor&s;e took fright, ran up
<PB N="37" REF="024407_0041_0FC70B8124724E98">
again&s;t the fence, and over&s;et the chair. I made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the unfortu|nate ladies. The elder &s;eemed to have received no great injury; but the young lady, either from the force of the fall, or through fear, had fainted away. I took her in my arms; her head reclined upon my bo&s;om&mdash;&s;he was delicate&mdash;&s;he was lovely: I felt an anxiety I never felt before. Love, though I knew it not, &s;tole into my heart under the di&s;gui&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion. I cha&s;ed her temples, her wri&s;ts, and the palms of her hands. The &s;oft touch thrilled through every vein, and awakened unu&s;ual &s;en&s;ibilities. She recovered, and, ob&s;erving her &s;ituation, with a gentle effort, di&s;engaged her&s;elf from my arms, and thanked me for my care with graceful ea&s;e and a lungui&s;hing voice. The el|der lady, who was her mother, joined in acknow|ledgements. The hor&s;e and broken chair were left at a neighbouring hou&s;e, and I in&s;i&s;ted on conduct|ing the ladies home.</P>
<P>LITTLE pa&s;&s;ed during this walk but thankful expre&s;&s;ions on the part of the ladies, and polite a&s;|&s;urances on mine. I did not fail, however, to examine the young lady's per&s;on and deportment with great attention, and the more I ob&s;erved the more I was plea&s;ed with her. As they were both much di&s;compo&s;ed by the accident, I did not think
<PB N="38" REF="024407_0042_0FC70B858FAF9060">
it proper to intrude upon them at that time; but took my leave at the door, with a promi&s;e to wait upon them the next day to enquire after their health.</P>
<P>WHEN I returned home, this adventure engro&s;&s;|ed all my thoughts; I &s;ecretly wi&s;hed my&s;elf &s;ome twenty years younger, that I might with proprie|ty make this aimable young woman all my own. What a trea&s;ure, &s;aid I, mu&s;t &s;he be to a man of &s;en&s;e and delicacy: How happy &s;hould I be at this time if I had, in the earlier part of my life, con|nected my&s;elf with &s;uch a &s;weet companion&mdash;but I have mi&s;&s;ed the golden opportunity, and mu&s;t e'en fret out the remainder of my days as well as I can.</P>
<P>THE day was long&mdash;the night longer. The next morning was chiefly &s;pent in preparations for my afternoon's vi&s;it. I was uncommonly particu|lar about my dre&s;s, although I had no deter|mined object in view. The barber had expre&s;s orders re&s;pecting the dre&s;&s;ing of my wig; my be&s;t &s;uit of broad-cloth was taken out of the pre&s;s, and my new beaver neatly and carefully bru&s;hed. In &s;hort, I was more attentive to my preparations for this vi&s;it than I had been for many years. But I
<PB N="39" REF="024407_0043_0FC70B86916E47C0">
placed all to the account of politene&s;s and ci|vility.</P>
<P>WHEN all was ready, I went to the gla&s;s to ad|ju&s;t my wig. I thought I looked uncommonly well&mdash;at lea&s;t I ob&s;erved a neatne&s;s in my dre&s;s and a vivacity in my countenance to which I had long been unaccu&s;tomed. Certain reflections aro&s;e in my mind which I could not then &s;uppre&s;s. And thus I rea&s;oned with my&s;elf. Few men carry their age better than I do&mdash;this mu&s;t be owing to the temperance and regularity of my pa&s;s'd life. A di&s;creet man of fifty hath the powers of life in greater vigour than a debauchee of twenty-five. Who knows what may happen?&mdash;perhaps&mdash;Oh! the enchanting idea!&mdash;&s;tranger things have come to pa&s;s&mdash;my fortune is unexceptionable&mdash;my per|&s;on, I think, not di&s;agreeable, and my con&s;titu|tion rather better &s;ince my late illne&s;s than be|fore. At this in&s;tant I took up my hat which lay on the table clo&s;e by an old quarto Family Bible, the corner of my hat, in lifting it, took hold of the upper cover of the Bible and threw it back&mdash;when behold! on the fir&s;t leaf of the afore&s;aid Bible, the&s;e words, in very legible characters, &s;aluted my eye&mdash;

not give you the figures&mdash;&s;uffice it to &s;ay, that this malicious accident had a great effect on my mind. It &s;truck the top-&s;ails of my vanity in a mo|ment, and di&s;per&s;ed all the gay ideas I had conju|red up. I left home &s;omewhat di&s;concerted; and many jarring &s;en&s;ibilities di&s;tracted my mind till I got to the hou&s;e where I was to make my vi&s;it.</P>
<P>IT is time to inform you that the mother of this young lady keeps &s;hop in&mdash;&s;treet: upon the profits of which, and the intere&s;t of a thou&s;and pounds left her by her decea&s;ed hu&s;band, &s;he &s;up|ports her&s;elf and her only daughter&mdash;Her hu&s;band had been a merchant of &s;ome note; but partly by lo&s;es in trade, and chiefly by living too expen|&s;ively for his income, had it not in his power to leave any thing con&s;iderable to his family. This intelligence I artfully obtained from an acquain|tance in the common way of chat.</P>
<P>I was received by my new friends with great cordiality. The mother was all complai&s;ance and civility, the daughter all &s;weetne&s;s and innocence. Our di&s;cour&s;e fir&s;t turned upon the accident of the preceding day. I was happy in finding it attended with no bad con&s;equences; and happier &s;till (as I took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve) it had been the means of introducing me to &s;uch an agreeable family; declar|ing
<PB N="41" REF="024407_0045_0FC70B939C372CD0">
my intention to take advantage of it by occa&s;i|nal vi&s;its. To this a reply was made quite to my &s;atisfaction. I &s;pent the afternoon and a good part of the evening mo&s;t agreeably. I returned home in high &s;pirits, and much enamoured with the young lady. I thought no more of the accident of the family Bible, but indulged my&s;elf for the re|mainder of the night in a thou&s;and golden dreams.</P>
<P>NOW, if ever you expect to hear from me a|gain, I in&s;i&s;t that you do not entitle this, or any &s;ub&s;equent letter from me, <HI>The Old Bachelor.</HI> I am not &s;o old perhaps as you may imagine.

<HEAD>ON MOTTOS.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS much entertained by your friend's expla|nation of the devices and mottos which di&s;tingui&s;h our continental bills of credit. When a motto ac|companies a device, there &s;hould be &s;uch a connec|tion between them that the one &s;hould be explana|tory of the other, &s;o that a little knowledge of the language from which the motto is &s;elected, &s;hould be &s;ufficient for a di&s;covery of the author's &s;en|timent. But I have often puzzled my brains to no purpo&s;e to tran&s;late &s;ome of the mottos in he|raldry; there being &s;eldom any connection between the device and the in&s;cription. And as the gram|mar of the motto is almo&s;t always incomplete, I have been inclined to think that the words were only intended as ornamental, in filling up the va|cant &s;pace of a hand&s;ome &s;croll.</P>
<P>YOUR writers of e&s;&s;ays and pamphlets are gene|rally very fond of mottos&mdash;as well no title-page as no motto. The per&s;on among&s;t the Indians who acts in the capacity of phy&s;ician and magician (for they always unite the&s;e characters) wears a leaf of &s;ome plant on his forehead or brea&s;t, to indicate
<PB N="43" REF="024407_0047_0FC70B9A0FBD82B0">
his knowledge in the medicinal qualities of herbs; ju&s;t &s;o a fragment from Virgil or Horace is fre|quently &s;tuck in the title-page of a pamphlet, mere|ly to &s;hew that the author under&s;tands Latin.</P>
<P>IT is curious to ob&s;erve how the works of the ancients have been frittered into &s;craps for this u&s;e, and how &s;trangely they have been mi&s;applied. Three or four detached words, having the lea&s;t &s;eeming analogy with the &s;ubject in hand, are ea|gerly &s;eized upon for a motto: whereas, perhaps, upon examining the pa&s;&s;age from which the&s;e words have been plundered, and ob&s;erving what precedes and what follows, we may find a &s;enti|ment very different from that to which the modern author hath applied them, if not directly contrary to it.</P>
<P>BY the &s;ame management pa&s;&s;ages in Holy Writ may be adduced as authorities for every &s;pecies of immorality and wickedne&s;s. For example, if I wanted a motto in favour of

<P>ABSURD as the&s;e applications of &s;cripture may appear, I have known learned preachers almo&s;t as much out of the way in handling a text. A text is a motto of the fir&s;t rank, as it is, or ought to be, the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;cour&s;e to ex|plain

Or, which is much wor&s;e, how often do preachers di&s;tort and mi&s;apply texts of &s;cripture to favour &s;ome new doctrine or erroneous dogma?</P>
<P>THERE is no doubt but that mottos may be u&s;ed to advantage, when they are &s;elected with judg|ment, and applied as an authority or elucidation of the &s;ubject in hand. They are with more propriety prefixed to &s;hort e&s;&s;ays than to prolix and elaborate works; becau&s;e the general &s;en&s;e of a conci&s;e per|formance may be conden&s;ed into a few words more ea&s;ily than can be expected of a diffu&s;e and volu|minous work.</P>

<P>I AM by birth a foreigner, have been &s;ome years in the mercantile way, and by a &s;ucce&s;sful attention to bu&s;ine&s;s have acquired a hand&s;ome fortune for a &s;ingle man.

<HEAD>A PRETTY STORY: Written in the year 1774.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>ONCE upon a time, a great while ago, there lived a certain nobleman, who had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very valuable farm, and had a great number of children and grand-children.</P>
<P>BESIDES the annual profits of his farm, which were very con&s;iderable, he kept a large &s;hop of goods; and being very &s;ucce&s;sful in trade, he be|came in proce&s;s of time exceeding rich and power|ful, in&s;omuch that all his neighbours feared and re&s;pected him.</P>
<P>HE had examined all the known &s;y&s;tems of oeconomy, and &s;elected from them, for the govern|ment of his own family, all &s;uch parts as appeared to be equitable and beneficial, and omitted tho&s;e which experience had &s;hown to be inconvenient or prejudicial: or rather, by blending their &s;everal con&s;titutions together, he had &s;o ingeniou&s;ly coun|ter-balanced
<PB N="66" REF="024407_0070_0FC70BF66E2E0580">
the evils of one by the benefits of another, that the advantages were fully enjoyed, and the inconveniences &s;carcely felt.</P>
<P>HE never exerci&s;ed any undue authority over his children or &s;ervants; neither indeed could he greatly oppre&s;s them, if he was ever &s;o di&s;po&s;ed; for it was particularly covenanted in his marriage arti|cles, that he &s;hould never impo&s;e any ta&s;k or hard|&s;hips upon his children without the con&s;ent of his wife.</P>
<P>Now the cu&s;tom in his family was this:&mdash;that at the end of every &s;even years his marriage be|came null and void, at which time his children and grand-children met together and cho&s;e another wife for him, whom the old gentleman was oblig|ed to marry under the &s;ame articles and re&s;trictions as before. By this means the children had always a great intere&s;t in their mother-in-law, and through her a rea&s;onable check upon their father's temper. For, be&s;ides that he could do nothing material re|&s;pecting them without her approbation, &s;he was &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of the pur&s;e-&s;trings, and gave him from time to time &s;uch &s;ums as <HI>&s;he</HI> thought nece&s;&s;ary for the expences of his family.</P>
<P>BEING one day in a very extraordinary good
<PB N="67" REF="024407_0071_0FC70BF7A6C4D5D0">
humour, he gave his children a writing under hand and &s;eal, by which he relea&s;ed them from many badges of dependence, and confirmed to them &s;everal very important privileges. The chief of the&s;e were, that none of his children &s;hould be puni&s;hed for any offence, or &s;uppo&s;ed offence, until twelve of his brethren had examined the facts, and declared him &s;ubject to &s;uch puni&s;h|ment; and, &s;econdly, he renewed his a&s;&s;urances that no ta&s;ks or hard&s;hips &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon them without the con&s;ent of their mother-in-law.</P>
<P>THIS writing, on account of its &s;ingular impor|tance, was called THE GREAT PAPER. After it was executed with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity, he cau&s;ed his chaplain to publi&s;h a dire anathema again&s;t all who &s;hould attempt to violate the articles of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> in the words following:</P>
<P>"In the name of the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Amen!

in writing: I therefore enjoin all per&s;ons, of what e&s;tate &s;oever they be, that they, and every of them, as much as in them is, &s;hall uphold and maintain the&s;e articles, granted by our Lord and Ma&s;ter, in all points.

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>NOW it came to pa&s;s, that this nobleman had, by &s;ome means or other, acquired a right to an immen&s;e tract: of wild, uncultivated country, at a va&s;t di&s;tance from his man&s;ion-hou&s;e. But he &s;et little &s;tore by this e&s;tate, as it yielded him no pro|fit, nor was it likely &s;o to do; being not only dif|ficult of acce&s;s on account of the di&s;tance, but was inhabited by numerous wild bea&s;ts, very fierce and &s;avage, &s;o as to render it very dangerous to at|tempt taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="024407_0073_0FC70C0006694028">IN proce&s;s of time, however, &s;ome of his chil|dren, more &s;tout and enterpri&s;ing than the re&s;t, reque&s;ted leave of their father to go and &s;ettle in this di&s;tant country. Leave was readily obtained: but before they &s;et out, certain articles were &s;tipu|lated between them. The old gentleman engaged on his part to protect the adventurers in their new &s;ettlement; to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in cha&s;ing away the wild bea&s;ts; and to extend to them all the e&s;&s;ential pri|vileges and benefits of the government under which they were born: a&s;&s;uring them, that although they would be removed &s;o far from his pre&s;ence, they &s;hould always be con&s;idered as the children of his family. At the &s;ame time he gave each of them a bond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charters.</NOTE> for the faithful performance of the&s;e promi&s;es: in which it was moreover covenanted, that they &s;hould have the privilege of making &s;uch rules and regulations for the good government of their re&s;pective families as they &s;hould find mo&s;t convenient: provided only, that the&s;e rules and regulations &s;hould not be contradictory to, or in|con&s;i&s;tent with, the general e&s;tabli&s;hed orders of his hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>IN return, he in&s;i&s;ted that they, on their parts, &s;hould at all times acknowledge him to be their
<PB N="70" REF="024407_0074_0FC70C0280D4EFB8">
father; that they &s;hould not deal with others with|out his leave, but &s;end to his &s;hop for what they might want, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell the produce of their lands to any but tho&s;e he &s;hould point out.</P>
<P>THESE preliminaries being duly adju&s;ted, our adventurers bid adieu to the comforts and conve|niences of their father's hou&s;e. Many and great were the difficulties and dangers they encounter|red on the way; but many more, and much grea|ter, on their arrival in the new country. There they found mountains covered with impervious fore&s;ts, and plains &s;teeped in &s;tagnated waters&mdash;no friend|ly roof to &s;helter them from the roaring tem|pe&s;t&mdash;no fortre&s;s to protect them from &s;urroun|ding dangers&mdash;many &s;unk under &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;|ea&s;e, and others fell a prey to the barbarous na|tives of the country.</P>
<P>THEY began, however, under all di&s;advantages to clear the land. The woods re&s;ound with the &s;trokes of the ax&mdash;they drain the waters from the &s;edged mora&s;s, and pour the &s;un beams on the reek|ing &s;oil. They are compelled to exert all the powers of indu&s;try and oeconomy for bare &s;ub&s;i|&s;tence; and, like their fir&s;t parents, when driven from paradi&s;e, to earn their bread with the &s;weat
<PB N="71" REF="024407_0075_0FC70C03E8891340">
of their brows. In this work they were frequently interrupted by the incur&s;ions of the &s;avages, a|gain&s;t whom they defended them&s;elves with great magnanimity.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time, however, by their indefati|gable per&s;everance they found them&s;elves comfor|tably &s;ettled, and had the delightful pro&s;pect of fields waving with luxuriant harve&s;ts, and orchards, glowing with the fruits of their labour.</P>
<P>IN the mean while they kept up a con&s;tant cor|re&s;pondence with their father's family; and provid|ed, at a great expence, the means of procuring from his &s;hop &s;uch goods and merchandizes as they wanted, for which they duly paid out of the produce of their lands, and the fruits of their indu&s;try.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>NOW the new &s;ettlers had adopted a mode of government in their &s;everal families &s;imilar to that to which they had been acu&s;tomed in their father's hou&s;e: particularly in taking a new wife at the end of certain periods of time, without who&s;e con&s;ent they could do nothing material in the conduct of their affairs. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, they
<PB N="72" REF="024407_0076_0FC70C08A8E661F8">
thrived exceedingly, and became very numerous, living in great harmony with each other, and in con&s;titutional obedience to their father's wife.</P>
<P>TO protect them again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the bar|barous natives, and the attacks of &s;ome of their neighbours, the old nobleman &s;ent a number of his &s;ervants, but then he required that they &s;hould reimbur&s;e him for the trouble and expence he was at in furni&s;hing this a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and this they cheer|fully did, by applying from time to time to their re&s;pective wives for the nece&s;&s;ary ca&s;h.</P>
<P>THUS did matters go on for a con&s;iderable time, to the mutual benefit of the old and new farms. But at la&s;t the nobleman's wife began to look with an avaricious eye towards the new &s;ettlers; &s;aying to her&s;elf, if by the natural con&s;equence of their friendly intercour&s;e with us, and con&s;titutional de|pendence on me our wealth and power are &s;o much encrea&s;ed, how much more would they accumu|late, if I can per&s;uade them, that all they po&s;&s;e&s;s belonged originally to me, and that I may, in right of my prerogative, demand of them &s;uch por|tions of their earnings as I plea&s;e. At the &s;ame time, being well aware of the promi&s;es and agree|ments her hu&s;band had made, and of the tenor and force of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> &s;he thought it be&s;t to pro|ceed
<PB N="73" REF="024407_0077_0FC70C0FE7AEAD18">
with great caution, and determined to gain her point, if po&s;&s;ible, by &s;ubtile and impercep|tible &s;teps.</P>
<P>FOR this purpo&s;e, &s;he fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued an edict, &s;et|ting forth&mdash;That whereas the taylors of her fami|ly were greatly injured by the people of the new farm, ina&s;much as they undertook to make up their own clothes, whereby the &s;aid taylors were depri|ved of the benefits that &s;hould ari&s;e from their trade: it was ordained, that for the future, the new &s;ettlers &s;hould not be permitted to have any <HI>&s;hears</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prohibition of &s;plitting-mills.</NOTE> or &s;ci&s;|&s;ars in their families, under &s;evere penalties. In con|&s;equence of this, our adventurers were obliged to have their clothes made up by the taylors of the old farm, although they were well able to make them up them&s;elves. Neverthele&s;s, out of re&s;pect to the old gentleman, they patiently &s;ubmitted to this im|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>OBSERVING al&s;o, that the new &s;ettlers were ve|ry fond of a kind of cyder, which they purcha&s;ed of a per&s;on in friend&s;hip with their father (the fruit proper for making this cyder not growing on their own grounds), &s;he i&s;&s;ued another edict<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Duty on wines.</NOTE>, obliging them to pay her a certain &s;tipend on every barrel
<PB N="74" REF="024407_0078_0FC70C11265BF240">
of this cyder u&s;ed in their families&mdash;To this they likewi&s;e &s;ubmitted; not yet &s;eeing the &s;cope of her de&s;igns again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THUS &s;he gradually proceeded in her plan, im|po&s;ing internal taxes on the new &s;ettlers, under various pretences, and receiving the fruits of their toil with both hands: moreover &s;he per&s;uaded her hu&s;band to &s;end among&s;t them, from time to time, a number of the mo&s;t lazy and worthle&s;s of his &s;ervants, under the &s;pecious pretext of defending them in their &s;ettlements; but, in fact, to rid his hou&s;e of their company, not having employment for them at home: and more e&s;pecially to be a watch and a check upon the people of the new farm. He had al&s;o ordered that the&s;e <HI>protec|tors,</HI> as they were called, &s;hould be &s;upplied by the new &s;ettlers with bread and butter, cut in a parti|cular form. But the head of one of the families, refu&s;ed to comply with this whim&s;ical order. He engaged to give the gue&s;ts, thus forced upon him, bread and butter &s;ufficient, but in&s;i&s;ted that his wife &s;hould cut it in what &s;hape &s;he plea&s;ed. This put the old nobleman in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;o|much that he had his &s;on's wife put into jail <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Su&s;pen&s;ion of the legi&s;lature of New York, for &s;upplying the army with pepper and vinegar, by act of a&s;&s;embly.</NOTE>, for

pre&s;uming to cut her own loaf according to her own mind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS the old nobleman advanced in years, he ne|glected the affairs of his family; leaving them chiefly to the management of his &s;teward. Now the &s;teward had actually debauched his wife, and gained an entire a&s;cendency over her. She no longer deliberated upon mea&s;ures that might be&s;t promote the pro&s;perity of the old farm or the new; but &s;aid and did whatever the &s;teward put into her head. Nay, &s;o entirely was &s;he under his influence, that &s;he could not utter even <HI>aye</HI> or <HI>no</HI> but as he directed her. For he had cunningly per&s;uaded her, that it was very fa&s;hionable for wo|men of quality to wear padlocks on their lips; and he accordingly fa&s;tened a &s;mall padlock to each cor|ner of her mouth: when the one was open &s;he could only cry <HI>aye;</HI> and when the other was un|locked &s;he could only &s;ay <HI>no.</HI> And he took care to keep the keys of the&s;e padlocks in his own pocket; &s;o that her words were the expre&s;&s;ions of his will rather than of her own.</P>
<P>NOW the old lady and the &s;teward had &s;et them&s;elves &s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t the people of the
<PB N="76" REF="024407_0080_0FC70C142636F580">
new farm; and began to devi&s;e ways and means for their total and unconditional &s;ubjection. And to this end they prevailed on the nobleman to &s;ign an edict again&s;t the new &s;ettlers; in which it was declared, that, as children, it was their duty to contribute towards &s;upplying their father's table with provi&s;ions, and towards the &s;upport of the dignity of his family; for which purpo&s;es it was ordained, that all their &s;poons, knives and forks, plates and porringers, &s;hould be marked <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Stamp act.</NOTE> with a certain mark by officers he &s;hould appoint for the purpo&s;e; for which marking they &s;hould pay certain fees into his &s;trong box: and it was or|dained, that they &s;hould not, under &s;evere penal|ties, pre&s;ume to u&s;e any &s;poon, knife, fork, plate or porringer before it had been &s;o marked by the officer, and the fees paid.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the new farm began now to &s;ee that their father's affections were alienated from them; and that their mother was but a ba&s;e mother-in-law, governed by their enemy the &s;tew|ard. They were thrown into great confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s by this di&s;covery. They wrote the mo&s;t &s;upplicating letters to their father; in which they acknowledged their dependence upon him in terms
<PB N="77" REF="024407_0081_0FC70C1A3907C6F8">
of the mo&s;t &s;incere affection and re&s;pect. They reminded him of the difficulties and hard&s;hips they had &s;uffered in &s;ettling this new farm; and point|ed out the great addition of wealth and power his family had acquired by their improvement of an unprofitable wilderne&s;s; and &s;howed him that all the fruits of their labour mu&s;t, by a natural cir|culation, finally enrich his money-box. They mentioned, in terms of humility, his promi&s;es and engagements to them when they left home, and the bonds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charters.</NOTE> he had given them; and held up in a &s;trong point of view, the &s;olemnity and impor|tance of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI> They acknowledged that he ought to be re-imbur&s;ed the expences he had incurred upon their account; and that it was their duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upporting the dignity of the family. All this they declared they were willing and ready to do; but reque&s;ted that they might do it in the manner pointed out by the <HI>Great Paper;</HI> by applying to their re&s;pective wives for the keys of their money-boxes, and furni&s;hing him from thence: but earne&s;tly prayed that they might not be &s;ubjected to the caprice and tyranny of an avaricious mother-in-law, whom they had never cho&s;en, and of a &s;teward, who was their declared enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="024407_0082_0FC70C1D1DD6C370">SOME of the&s;e letters were intercepted by the &s;teward; others indeed were delivered to the no|bleman: but he was per&s;uaded not only to treat them with contempt, but to in&s;i&s;t the more &s;tre|nuou&s;ly on the right his wife claimed to mark the knives and forks, plates and porringers, of the new &s;ettlers.</P>
<P>WHEN the people of the new farm heard of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their letters, and under&s;tood how matters were conducted in their father's fa|mily, they were exceedingly alarmed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. They con&s;ulted together on the &s;ituation of affairs, and determined that they would no longer &s;ubmit to the arbitrary impo&s;itions of their mother-in-law, and of their enemy the &s;teward; that they con&s;i|dered the new decree as a direct violation of the <HI>Great Paper;</HI> and would not pay obedience to it, but would &s;up their broth and eat their pudding as u&s;ual, without having their &s;poons, knives and forks, plates or porringers, marked by the new officers.</P>
<P>THE old nobleman and his wife, finding that the new decree could not be e&s;tabli&s;hed without actual force, and fearing the con&s;equences of an open conte&s;t, thought fit to annul the offen&s;ive
<PB N="79" REF="024407_0083_0FC70C1EAC2BE838">
edict, under the pretence of <HI>mere expediency;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Declaratory Act.</NOTE> de|claring and prote&s;ting, at the &s;ame time, that he and his wife had an undoubted right to mark all the furniture of the new &s;ettlers, if they plea&s;ed, from the &s;ilver tankard in the clo&s;et to the cham|ber-pot under the bed: that, with re&s;pect to them, he was not bound by the &s;hackles of the <HI>Great Pa|per;</HI> and in a word, that he and wife had, and ought to have, an uncontroled power over them, their lives, liberties, and property.</P>
<P>THE people, however, took little notice of the&s;e pompous declarations. They were glad that the marking decree was annulled; and were in hopes that by degrees things would &s;ettle in their former cour&s;e, and mutual affection be again re&s;tored.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time the new &s;ettlers encrea&s;ed ex|ceedingly, their dealings at their father's &s;hop be|came proportionably enlarged, and their partia|lity for their brethren of the old farm was &s;incere and manife&s;t. They &s;uffered, indeed, &s;ome in conveniences from the <HI>protectors</HI> which had been &s;tationed among&s;t them, who became very trou|ble&s;ome
<PB N="80" REF="024407_0084_0FC70C210721DDE0">
in their hou&s;es. They introduced riot and intemperance into their families, debauched their daughters, and derided the orders they had made for their own good government. Moreover, the old nobleman had, at different times, &s;ent over to them a great number of thieves, murderers, and robbers, who did much mi&s;chief by practi&s;ing tho&s;e crimes for which they had been bani&s;hed from the old farm. But they bore tho&s;e evils with as much patience as could be expected; not chu&s;ing to trouble their old father with complaints, unle&s;s in ca&s;es of important nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>NOW the &s;teward began to hate the new &s;ettlers with exceeding great hatred, and determined to renew his attack upon their peace and happine&s;s. He artfully in&s;inuated to the nobleman and his fooli&s;h wife, that it was very mean, and unbecom|ing their greatne&s;s, to receive the contributions of the people of the new farm through the con&s;ent of their re&s;pective wives: that upon this footing they might &s;ome time or other refu&s;e to comply with his requi&s;itions, if they &s;hould take into their heads to think them oppre&s;&s;ive and unrea&s;onable; and that it was high time they &s;hould be compelled to acknowledge his unlimited power and his wife's <HI>omnipotence,</HI> which, if not enforced now, they would &s;oon be able to re&s;i&s;t, as they were daily encrea&s;ing in numbers and &s;trength.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="024407_0085_0FC70C2A528DBD98">ANOTHER decree was, therefore, prepared and publi&s;hed, directing that the people of the new farm &s;hould pay a certain &s;tipend upon particular goods,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Painter's colours, gla&s;s&punc; &amp;c.</NOTE> which they were not allowed to purcha&s;e any where but at their father's &s;hop; &s;pecifying that this impo&s;ition &s;hould not be laid as an ad|vance upon the original price of the&s;e goods, but &s;hould be paid as a tax on their arrival in the new farm; for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of &s;upporting the dignity of the nobleman's family, and for re-im|bur&s;ing the expences he pretended to have been at on their account.</P>
<P>THIS new decree occa&s;ioned great unea&s;ine&s;s. The people &s;aw plainly that the &s;teward and their mother-in-law were determined to en&s;lave and ruin them. They again con&s;ulted together, and wrote, as before, the mo&s;t dutiful and per&s;ua&s;ive letters to their father&mdash;but to no purpo&s;e&mdash;a deaf ear was turned again&s;t all their remon&s;trances, and their humble reque&s;ts rejected with contempt.</P>
<P>FINDING that this moderate and decent conduct brought them no relief, they had recour&s;e to ano|ther expedient: they bound them&s;elves to each other in a &s;olemn engagement,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Non-importation agreement.</NOTE> not to deal any
<PB N="82" REF="024407_0086_0FC70C2B6E2CA208">
more at their father's &s;hop, until this uncon&s;titu|tional decree &s;hould be repealed, which they one and all declared to be a direct violation of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI></P>
<P>THIS agreement was &s;o &s;trictly ob&s;erved, that in a few months the clerks and apprentices in the old gentleman's &s;hop began to rai&s;e a terrible outcry. They declared, that their ma&s;ter's trade was de|clining exceedingly, and that his wife and &s;teward would by their mi&s;chievous machinations ruin the whole farm. They &s;harpened their pens, and at|tacked the &s;teward, and even the old lady her&s;elf, with great &s;everity: in&s;omuch, that it was thought proper to withdraw this attempt al&s;o, upon the rights and liberties of the new &s;ettlers.

<P>NOW there were certain men <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The India company.</NOTE> in the old farm, who had obtained an exclu&s;ive right of &s;elling <HI>wa|ter-gruel.</HI> Va&s;t quantities of this gruel were vend|ed among&s;t the new &s;ettlers, as they were extreme|ly fond of it, and u&s;ed it univer&s;ally in their families.

<PB N="83" REF="024407_0087_0FC70C2CDDB8E6E8">
plea&s;ed with the repeal of the other parts of the decree, and fond as they were of this gruel, they con&s;idered it as not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the comfort of life, and determined to give up the u&s;e of it in their families, and &s;o avoid the effects of that part of the decree.</P>
<P>THE &s;teward found his de&s;igns again fru&s;trated: but was not di&s;couraged by the di&s;appointment. He devi&s;ed another &s;cheme, &s;o artfully contrived, that he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;ent for the per&s;ons who had the &s;ole right of vending <HI>water-gruel;</HI> and after reminding them of the o|bligations they were under to the nobleman and his wife for the exclu&s;ive privilege they enjoyed, he reque&s;ted that they would &s;end &s;undry waggons la|den with gruel to the new farm; promi&s;ing that the accu&s;tomed duty which they paid for their exclu&s;ive right &s;hould be taken off from all the gruel they &s;hould &s;o &s;end among&s;t the new &s;ettlers; and that in ca&s;e their cargoes &s;hould come to any damage, the lo&s;s &s;hould be made good to them out of his ma&s;ter's coffers.</P>
<P>THE gruel-merchants readily con&s;ented to this propo&s;al; con&s;idering that if their cargoes were &s;old, their profits would be very great; and if they failed, the &s;teward was to pay the damage.
<PB N="84" REF="024407_0088_0FC70C2E6FCEE058">
On the other hand, the &s;teward hoped that the new &s;ettlers would not be able to re&s;i&s;t a tempta|tion, thus thrown in their way, of purcha&s;ing their favourite gruel, to which they had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed; and if they did u&s;e it, &s;ubject to the tax afore&s;aid, he would con&s;ider this as a vo|luntary acknowledgement that the nobleman and his wife had a right to lay upon them what impo&s;i|tions they plea&s;ed, and as a re&s;ignation of the pri|vileges of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the new &s;ettlers were well aware of this decoy. They &s;aw plainly that the gruel was not &s;ent for their accommodation; and that if they &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ered any part of it to be &s;old among&s;t them, &s;ubject to the tax impo&s;ed by the new de|cree, it would be con&s;idered as a willing &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the a&s;&s;umed omnipotence of their mother-in-law, and a precedent for future unlimited impo|&s;itions. Some, therefore, would not permit the wag|gons to be unladen at all; but &s;ent them back un|touched to the gruel-merchants; and others &s;uf|fered them to unload, but would not touch the dangerous commodity; &s;o that it lay neglected a|bout the roads and high-ways till it was quite &s;poiled. But one of the new &s;ettlers, who&s;e name was JACK, either from a keener &s;en&s;e of the in|juries intended, or from the nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="85" REF="024407_0089_0FC70C34AD6BD690">

<P>THESE violent proceedings were &s;oon known at the old farm. Great was the uproar there. The old nobleman fell into a furious pa&s;&s;ion, de|claring that the new &s;ettlers meant to throw off all dependence upon him, and rebel again&s;t his authori|ty. His wife al&s;o tore the padlocks from her lips, and raved and &s;tormed like a Billing&s;gate, and the &s;teward lo&s;t all patience and moderation&mdash;&s;wearing mo&s;t profanely, <HI>that he would leave no &s;tone un|turned, till he had humbled the &s;ettlers of the new farm at his feet, and cau&s;ed their father to tread upon their necks.</HI> Moreover, the gruel-merchants roared and bellowed for the lo&s;s of their gruel; and the clerks and apprentices were in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation le&s;t the people of the new farm &s;hould again agree to have no dealings with their father's &s;hop.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="024407_0090_0FC70C375EEF9DE0">VENGEANCE was forthwith prepared, e&s;pecially again&s;t <HI>Jack.</HI> With him they determined to be|gin; hoping that by making a &s;evere example of him, they &s;hould &s;o terrify the other families, that they would all &s;ubmit to the power of the &s;tew|ard and acknowledge the omnipotence of the <HI>great Madam.</HI></P>
<P>A very large padlock <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Bo&s;ton Port-bill.</NOTE> was &s;ent over to be fa&s;tened on <HI>Jack's</HI> great gate; the key of which was given to the old nobleman, who was not to &s;uffer it to be opened until <HI>Jack</HI> had paid for the gruel he had &s;pilt, and re&s;igned all claim to the privileges of the <HI>Great Paper</HI>&mdash;nor even then, unle&s;s he &s;hould think fit. Secondly, A decree was made to new model the regulations and oeconomy of <HI>Jack's</HI> family, in &s;uch manner that they might in future be more &s;ubjected to the will of the &s;teward. And, thirdly, A large gallows was erected before the man&s;ion-hou&s;e in the old farm, that if any of Jack's children &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of mi&s;behaviour, they &s;hould not be convicted or acquitted by the voice of their bre|thren, according to the purport of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> but he tied neck and heels, and &s;ent over to be hanged on this gallows.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="024407_0091_0FC70C38DE476760">ON hearing of the&s;e &s;everities, the people were highly enraged. They were at a lo&s;s how to act, or by what means they &s;hould avoid the threat|ened vengeance. But the old lady and the &s;teward per&s;i&s;ted. The great padlock was fa&s;tened on <HI>Jack's</HI> gate, and the key given to the nobleman as had been determined on; without waiting to know whether <HI>Jack</HI> would pay for the gruel, or allowing him an opportunity to make any apology or defence.</P>
<P>POOR <HI>Jack</HI> was now in a deplorable condition indeed: The great inlet to his farm was entirely &s;hut up; &s;o that he could neither carry out the produce of his land for &s;ale, nor receive from abroad the nece&s;&s;aries for his family.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all&mdash;The old nobleman, a|long with the padlock afore&s;aid, had &s;ent an over|&s;eer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Gage, made Governor of the province.</NOTE> to hector and domineer over <HI>Jack</HI> and his family, and to endeavour to break his &s;pirits by every po&s;&s;ible &s;everity; for which purpo&s;e, this over&s;eer was attended by a great number of mer|cenaries, and armed with more than common au|thorities.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="024407_0092_0FC70C42FB09DC70">WHEN the over&s;eer fir&s;t arrived in <HI>Jack's</HI> fa|mily, he was received with great re&s;pect, becau&s;e he was the delegate of their aged father.

<P>BUT this fair weather did not la&s;t long.

<DATE>Dec. 3, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUNT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now been &s;ix months in England, and eight weeks in this metropolis. You &s;hould have heard from me before; but my frequent avoca|tions, as well as the want of a &s;uitable opportunity, have prevented. Agreeably to my promi&s;e, however, I now &s;it down to give you &s;ome ac|count of the character and politics of this &s;trange people. So copious a &s;ubject cannot be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in one letter; but you &s;hall hear from me again, when further ob&s;ervation &s;hall have enabled me to be more particular.</P>
<P>THE general character of the Engli&s;h is certain|ly the mo&s;t fanta&s;tic and ab&s;urd that ever fell to the lot of any known nation. As they are made up of contradictions, it would be unju&s;t to give them any uniform de&s;ignation. There is &s;carce a

virtue that adorns the mind, or a vice that di&s;graces human nature, but may be a&s;cribed to them as part of their national character. But the former are often rendered ineffectual by mi&s;application, and the latter qualified by a levity of manners, which &s;hews them not to be con&s;titutionally preva|lent. An Engli&s;hman will treat his enemy with great genero&s;ity, and his friend with ingratitude and inhumanity. He will be lavi&s;h of his wealth when he has but little of it, and become a mi&s;erly wretch when fortune pours her favours into his pur&s;e. He will brave th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t hard&s;hips, and encounter the &s;evere&s;t trials with heroic fortitude; and will drown or hang him&s;elf becau&s;e the wind is in the ea&s;t. He will lend large &s;ums to a &s;tranger on the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ecurity, and refu&s;e his neare&s;t relation the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. To-day, his heart expands with &s;ocial benevolence; to-morrow, he is cold, &s;ullen and moro&s;e&mdash;To-day, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the wealth of a nabob; to-morrow, he refu&s;es a &s;ix-pence to a beggar, le&s;t he &s;hould him&s;elf be reduced to the want of that &s;ix-pence. In a word, contradiction and ab&s;urdity make an Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>DURING the la&s;t century, this people hath ri&s;en in wealth, power, and pro&s;perity; but the in&s;ta|bility of their temper will not permit them to en|joy with content any ble&s;&s;ing in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;At

It is no uncommon thing to &s;pend an evening with a man, in all the ea&s;y gaiety of &s;ocial life, and to hear next morning that he hanged him&s;elf in a &s;table, or practi&s;ed phlebotomy on his own jugular vein with a razor.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h now govern in the Ea&s;t Indies with a tyranny &s;o pure, &s;o unadulterated with any mixture of ju&s;tice or humanity, as could not have been exceeded in the reigns of the twelve Cae&s;ars.</P>
<P>THIS be&s;t of all kings has now turned his at|tention to AMERICA. There he had three mil|lions of &s;ubjects, who loved, honored, and obeyed him. He governed them by officers of his own ap|pointment: he had the whole regulation of their commerce; and the over-flowings of their wealth were conducted, by ea&s;y channels, into his coffers, and into the pur&s;es of the merchants and manu|facturers of his kingdom. But he has quarrelled with the&s;e loyal and beneficial &s;ubjects, becau&s;e they
<PB N="102" REF="024407_0106_0FC708AB45C0ABE8">
are &s;o ob&s;tinate that they will not acknowledge that <HI>two and two make five.</HI> Whole volumes have been written on this &s;ubject, and all the force of rea|&s;on and eloquence exerted to convince this wi&s;e king that he is in an error. The Americans have mo&s;t emphatically be&s;eeched him to accept of the undi&s;&s;embled loyalty of their hearts; de|claring that they are &s;atisfied that the fruits of their indu&s;try &s;hould center with him and his people, as heretofore, to enrich and aggrandi&s;e them; but humbly pray that they may not be compelled to acknowledge that <HI>two and two make five,</HI> which would be to them a mo&s;t dangerous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing violation of truth. But this wi&s;e and humane monarch is far from being di&s;po&s;ed to give up the point. He has rejected their pe|titions with &s;corn, and &s;purned at their offers of affection and fidelity; and declares, that he will even ri&s;k the crown of his ance&s;tors, but he will make the ob&s;tinate Americans &s;ub&s;cribe to his new dogma.</P>
<P>TO this end he hath &s;ent over, not only his own fleets and armies, but has hired a banditti of foreign mercenaries from a petty prince, who &s;up|ports the &s;plendor of his court by &s;elling the blood of his &s;ubjects; and he has al&s;o employed negroes and wild Indians to per&s;ecute the poor Americans
<PB N="103" REF="024407_0107_0FC708B9A8BC0E08">
without mercy, until they &s;hall acknowledge that <HI>two and two make five.</HI></P>
<P>AMERICA is at this time a &s;cene of de&s;olation and di&s;tre&s;s; a theatre whereon is acted a real tragedy, exhibiting every &s;pecies of cruelty and inju&s;tice. The royal army of this mo&s;t enlight|ened of all nations are ravi&s;hing the women, mur|dering the men, and laying wa&s;te that fertile and beautiful country, under the conduct of Lord and General <HI>Howe;</HI> who are executing their bloody mandate, with all the compo&s;ure in the world. His mo&s;t gracious maje&s;ty receives, from time to time, &s;uch accounts of their proceedings as they plea&s;e to give him, and is as happy as &s;uch a mo|narch can be.</P>
<P>WHO would have thought that the peaceful plains of America would be de&s;olated becau&s;e the inhabitants will not believe that <HI>two and two make five,</HI> when their good king and his wi&s;e parliament require them &s;o to do.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the Americans, highly re&s;ent|ting this treatment, have declared, that they will no longer be pen&s;ioners of the &s;miles of &s;uch a king, or &s;ubmit to a government in which they have no &s;hare, and over which they have no con|trol,
<PB N="104" REF="024407_0108_0FC708BAEDDD93C0">
and which is therefore, with re&s;pect to them, a government of mere will and plea&s;ure. They have determined to be henceforth a <HI>free</HI> peo|ple; and have publicly avowed that they will en|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oy the ine&s;timable, privileges of believing, and &s;ay|ing, that <HI>two and two make only four,</HI> according to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind.</P>
<P>HOW this affair will terminate, God only knows: but it &s;eems very probable, that the king of England will lo&s;e the mo&s;t valuable jewel of his crown, in the pur&s;uit of his pre&s;ent views.</P>
<P>YOU will &s;ay, perhaps, that the king could not act &s;o ab&s;urdly were he not countenanced and &s;upported in his folly by the a&s;&s;ent of his people. But the truth is that the king, by means of his mini&s;ters hath gained &s;uch an a&s;cendency over the parliament, which is the con&s;titutional voice of the people, that he can obtain their &s;anction for any project in which their rights are not openly and directly attacked. As to the people at large, they do not trouble them&s;elves about the right or wrong of the matter in conte&s;t. America is a great way off, and they have no feelings for what is pa&s;|&s;ing there. They grumble, indeed, about the dimi|nution of their trade in con&s;equence of this war, but leave the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of national politics to their

parliament. The crown hath imperceptibly ex|tended its prerogative &s;o as to de&s;troy the boa&s;ted balance of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution; and if the king's power &s;hould be further &s;trengthened by the &s;ubjugation of America, the people of England may bid adieu to their con&s;titutional freedom. Some of the wi&s;e&s;t among&s;t them &s;ee this, and have openly declared, that the &s;alvation of Eng|land depends upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the Americans in the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P>THIS infatuated people have wearied the world, for the&s;e hundred years with loud eulogiums liberty and their con&s;titution; and yet they &s;ee that con&s;titution langui&s;hing in a deep decay, with|out making any efforts for its recovery. Amu&s;ed with trifles, and accu&s;tomed to venality and cor|ruption, they are not alarmed at the con&s;equences of their &s;upinene&s;s. They love to talk of their glorious con&s;titution, becau&s;e the idea is agree|able, and they are &s;atisfied with the idea, and they honour their king, becau&s;e it is the fa&s;hion to honour the king. Half the loyalty of the nation is &s;up|ported by two popular &s;ongs. viz. "<HI>Britons &s;trike home; and God &s;ave the king.</HI> The&s;e are vo|ciferated at taverns, over porter, punch and wine, till the imagination is heated, and the blood in a ferment, and then the&s;e pot-valiant patriots &s;al|ly

<P>THERE are fanatics in politics as well as in re|ligion, and both are managed in the &s;ame way, viz. by keeping up the delu&s;ion in which they delight The men in power well know the weak|ne&s;s of the multitude, and when they ob&s;erve them to grow unea&s;y under the too barefaced en|croachments of prerogative, they get half a do|zen of court &s;cribblers to expatiate on the glories of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and to &s;ing the &s;weet Lullaby of Liberty to the people&mdash;and all is well. Ju&s;t &s;o a nur&s;e rattles three pieces of tin in a little ru&s;h ba&s;ket to amu&s;e her crying child. The poor infant thinks it has the world in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and is &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>THE extreme ignorance of the common peo|ple of this civilized country can &s;carce be cre|dited. In general they know nothing beyond the particular branch of bu&s;ine&s;s which their parents or the pari&s;h happened to chu&s;e for them. This, in|deed, they practi&s;e with unremitting diligence; but never think of extending their knowledge farther.</P>

<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> WHAT is WAR?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The cur&s;e of mankind; the mother of famine and pe&s;tilence; the &s;ource of compli|cated mi&s;eries; and the undi&s;tingui&s;hing de&s;troy|er of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is war divided?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Into <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> and <HI>defen&s;ive.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the general object of an offen&s;ive war?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Sometimes it is to regain by the &s;word what had been unju&s;tly taken from the rightful po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or: Sometimes to prevent impending dangers, which cannot be avoided by other means: But, for the mo&s;t part, it is undertaken to gratify the ambition of a prince, who wi&s;hes to &s;ubject to his arbitrary will a people whom God created free,
<PB N="112" REF="024407_0116_0FC708E4ECDD88E0">
and to gain an uncontrolled dominion over their rights and property.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Are there any in&s;tances of &s;uch princes?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, many. Hi&s;tory is filled with the wick|ed lives and mi&s;erable deaths of tyrants. The pre&s;ent king of Great Britain, who&s;e hi&s;tory is not yet completed, is a living example of &s;uch a prince. He carried an offen&s;ive war into the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and deprived many thou&s;ands of tho&s;e in|nocent people of their lives and property: and he is now carrying on an offen&s;ive war in <HI>America,</HI> without one &s;pecious plea of ju&s;tice for &s;o doing: Mo&s;t wickedly aiming at the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of that exten&s;ive country, and its numerous inhabi|tants. For this purpo&s;e he has &s;pread de&s;olation and death among&s;t their friendly habitations, and pro&s;ecutes his wicked de&s;ign with aggravated cru|elty and horror.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What may ju&s;tly be &s;aid of &s;uch a prince?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That he looks on his fellow-creatures as created only for his u&s;e, and makes their mi&s;ery his &s;port. That the &s;pirit of thou&s;ands, who have fallen a &s;acrifice to his ambition, flutter round the poli&s;hed points of his imperial crown, and cry to
<PB N="113" REF="024407_0117_0FC708E668FC2830">
heaven for ju&s;tice&mdash;that his throne re&s;ts on the &s;culls of the &s;lain&mdash;that his unhallowed fea&s;ts are defiled with blood&mdash;and that the cur&s;es of widows and orphans are poured out again&s;t him at every ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>THAT hi&s;tory will do ju&s;tice to his memory, and record his crimes with his name, for the ab|horrence of po&s;terity&mdash;and that the blood he has wantonly &s;pilt in unju&s;t pur&s;uits will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be required of his hands.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> WHAT is <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> war?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IT is to take up arms in oppo&s;ition to the in|va&s;ions of u&s;urped power, and bravely &s;uffer pre|&s;ent hard&s;hips, and encounter pre&s;ent dangers, to &s;ecure the rights of humanity, and the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom, to generations yet unborn.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> IS even defen&s;ive war ju&s;tifiable in a reli|gious view?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> THE foundation of war is laid in the wick|edne&s;s of mankind. Were all men ju&s;t and good, there would be no cau&s;e of contention among&s;t them; but as the ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e, war is be|come ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as many other in&s;ti|tutions
<PB N="114" REF="024407_0118_0FC708F16A0A8AF0">
are, which derive their origin from the weakne&s;s or wickedne&s;s of men. Even laws and government would be u&s;ele&s;s encumbrances were there no open violence or &s;ecret treachery to be guarded again&s;t. God has given man will to con|trive, power to execute, and freedom of will to di|rect his conduct. It cannot be but that &s;ome, from a depravity of will, will abu&s;e the&s;e privi|leges, and exert the&s;e powers to the injury of o|thers: and the oppre&s;&s;ed would have no &s;afety or redre&s;s but by exerting the &s;ame powers in their defence: and it is our duty to &s;et a proper value upon, and defend to the utmo&s;t, our ju&s;t rights, and the ble&s;&s;ings of life: otherwi&s;e a few mi&s;|creants would tyranni&s;e over the re&s;t of mankind, and make the pa&s;&s;ive multitude the &s;laves of their power. Thus it is that <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> is not only ju&s;ti|fiable, but an indi&s;pen&s;able duty.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> IS it upon the&s;e principles that the people of America are re&s;i&s;ting the arms of Great-Bri|tain, and oppo&s;ing force with force?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> STRICTLY &s;o&mdash;The Americans had nothing in view but to live peaceably and dutifully under a con&s;titutional &s;ubjection to their acknowledged &s;o|vereign. They patiently &s;ubmitted to many un|ju&s;t encroachments of power. They were not te|nacious
<PB N="115" REF="024407_0119_0FC708F61387FC18">
of every right. But at la&s;t the de&s;igns of Great-Britain became too manife&s;t to be mi&s;taken: and the Americans were urged on to the di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity of chu&s;ing one of two great evils; either to enli&s;t them&s;elves, and their unborn po&s;te|rity, the unconditional &s;laves of a corrupt and wicked admini&s;tration; or to brave the horrors of war, under every di&s;advantage, in a noble &s;truggle for the rights of mankind. They have re&s;olutely determined on the latter; and after &s;olemnly ap|pealing to God and the world for the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, are pro&s;ecuting the war with promi&s;ing hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. Supported by the rectitude of their principles, they have &s;urmounted the greate&s;t difficulties, and have exhibited in&s;tances of per&s;on|al bravery and military conduct not exceeded by the heroes of antiquity&mdash;And may Heaven pro&s;per their virtuous undertaking!</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> BUT it has often been &s;aid, that America is in a &s;tate of rebellion. Tell me, therefore, what is REBELLION?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IT is when a great number of people, headed by one or more factious leaders, aim at depo&s;ing their lawful prince, without any ju&s;t cau&s;e of com|plaint, in order to place another on his throne.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="024407_0120_0FC708F9EBB98EC8"><HI>Q.</HI> IS this the ca&s;e of the Americans?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> FAR otherwi&s;e.&mdash;They have repeatedly de|clared, with the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations, that they were ready to &s;upport, with their lives and fortunes, the pre&s;ent king of Great-Britain, on the throne of his ance&s;tors; and only reque&s;ted, in return the enjoyment of tho&s;e rights, which the Briti&s;h con&s;titution confirms to all his &s;ubjects; and without which, the boa&s;ted freedom of that con&s;ti|tution is but a &s;olemn mockery and an empty name.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> TO whom has the king of England commit|ted the conduct of this war?</P>
<P><HI>A. TO Lord and General</HI> HOWE.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> WHO are the&s;e gentlemen?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> THEY are the brothers of a <HI>Colonel</HI> HOWE, who fought bravely along with the Americans in a former war between the Engli&s;h and French, and fell in battle. The Americans loved and honoured this <HI>Colonel Howe:</HI> they lamented his fate, and at their own expence erected a monument to his me|mory in the town of Bo&s;ton. But the&s;e gentlemen, with unrelenting hearts, and &s;acrilegious hands,
<PB N="117" REF="024407_0121_0FC708FDC0472AC0">
have defiled their brother's tomb with the blood of tho&s;e who&s;e affection had rai&s;ed it to his ho|nour; and have plunged their ho&s;tile &s;words into bo&s;oms glowing with love and e&s;teem for their mo|ther's &s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> WHAT progre&s;s have they made in &s;ubdu|ing America?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> VERY little.&mdash;They got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town of <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> but could not hold it. They were but tenants at will there, &s;trictly &s;peaking, for their landlords ejected them without any warn|ing, and di&s;trained for rent upon certain military &s;tores.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What did they next?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> THEY took <HI>Staten-I&s;land,</HI> where there was nothing to oppo&s;e them, and a part of <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and &s;o <HI>ferried</HI> them&s;elves over to the city of <HI>New-York.</HI> From thence they crept into <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> and taking advantage of a critical period, when the A|merican troops were di&s;banded by the expiration of their enli&s;tments, and before a new army could be rai&s;ed, they advanced to the banks of the <HI>De|laware,</HI> well knowing that there was nothing to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s. On the banks of the <HI>De|laware</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="024407_0122_0FC709019B4F60F8">
they &s;at them&s;elves down, and fell to plun|dering the adjacent country. In the mean time they publi&s;hed an enticing proclamation, offering pardon and protection to all tho&s;e who would ac|cept of it, upon the ea&s;y terms of <HI>unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</HI> But the Americans did not de&s;pair: they &s;oon found a &s;pirited militia to &s;upply the place of their di&s;banded troops until a new army could be rai&s;ed. This militia, with a &s;mall remain|der of the regular troops, cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Delaware</HI> at midnight, in a &s;now-&s;torm, and following their gal|lant general through the mo&s;t &s;evere and inclement weather, unexpectedly attacked, and drove the enemy from their &s;tation in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and made twelve hundred of their men pri&s;oners of war, and then re-cro&s;&s;ed the river to their for|mer encampment. The Briti&s;h then rallied, and returned to their po&s;t, knowing that a large rein|forcement was on the way to their relief. But the American general, having a range of fires along the banks of the river to deceive the enemy, marched his army in the night, re-cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>De|laware,</HI> and by a circuitous rout, &s;urpri&s;ed, attack|ed, and defeated the enemy's expected reinforce|ment.

<P><HI>A.</HI> TO him the title of <HI>Excellency</HI> is applied with peculiar propriety. He is the be&s;t and the great|e&s;t man the world ever knew. In private life, he wins the hearts and wears the love of all who are &s;o happy as to fall within the circle of his ac|quaintance.
<PB N="120" REF="024407_0124_0FC70911478BCEF8">
In his public character, he com|mands univer&s;al re&s;pect and admiration. Con&s;ci|ous that the principles on which he acts are indeed founded in virtue and truth, he &s;teadily pur&s;ues the arduous work with a mind neither depre&s;&s;ed by di&s;appointment and difficulties, nor elated with temporary &s;ucce&s;s. He retreats like a General, and attacks like a Hero. Had he lived in the days of idolatry, he had been wor&s;hipped as a God. One age cannot do ju&s;tice to his merit; but a grateful po&s;terity &s;hall, for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, re|member the great deliverer of his country.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO LORD HOWE.
<DATE>[December 1776.]</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHATEVER errors the court of Great Britain might have fallen into in the commencement of the pre&s;ent unhappy conte&s;t with America, it was at lea&s;t a politic &s;tep to commit the conduct of this important affair to your Lord&s;hip, and the Ge|neral your brother.</P>
<P>THE name of <HI>Howe</HI> is dear to America; and among&s;t the many di&s;tre&s;&s;ing difficulties we have to encounter, it is no incon&s;iderable one to over|come the predilection we feel for your family. The exalted virtues of your heroic brother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Colonel Lord' Howe,</HI> was in Gen. Abercombie's army at the battle of Ticonderoga, and was there killed by a random &s;hot. The town of Bo&s;ton erected a Monument to his memory.</NOTE>, who&s;e bones are embraced by that &s;oil you are now drenching with blood, often ri&s;e in painful re|membrance.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="024407_0126_0FC7091B9AAEFE60">WE are ready to acknowledge the good di&s;po|&s;itions that di&s;tingui&s;h your private character, and whil&s;t we feel the &s;mart of the wounds you inflict, wi&s;h they had been admini&s;tered by another hand. We would fondly con&s;ider you as the exe|cutioner of another's wrath&mdash;not your own: and forgive with as much &s;incerity&mdash;pardon the allu|&s;ion!&mdash;as the condemned wretch forgives the ap|pointed officer who is about to torture him into another &s;tate of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THE idea we have of your Lord&s;hip's character compels us to &s;uppo&s;e, that before you undertook this cruel ta&s;k your con&s;cience was fully convin|ced, that the inflexible rules of right and ho|nour, and the &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, fully authori&s;ed the pre&s;ent war: and that the re&s;i&s;tance of America to the claims of the Bri|ti&s;h legi&s;lature is, and ought to be, deemed <HI>rebelli|on.</HI> Under &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, can we blame your Lord&s;hip for a&s;&s;erting and enforcing what you may believe to be the rights of your &s;overeign.</P>
<P>LET the &s;ame candour be extended to the poor Americans. They think and are fully per|&s;uaded, that neither the rules of honour or e|quity, the &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, or the rights of mankind, can authori&s;e the views of Bri|tain

in the pro&s;ecution of the pre&s;ent war: on the contrary they believe, that is an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, which they owe to them&s;elves and their un|born po&s;terity, to oppo&s;e to the utmo&s;t the troops you have brought into their country, and to re|fu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the yoke that is prepared for them. Ought they not then to be re&s;pected as ac|ting upon the be&s;t principles, however ill-founded you may &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e principles to be? And ought you not at lea&s;t to pity, whil&s;t you think you ju&s;tly puni&s;h?</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent di&s;pute is, what the rights of the crown and parliament are with re&s;pect to Ameri|ca, and what they are not&mdash;Great Britain would have us acknowledge her claims of unlimited pow|er; and that too, without rea&s;oning on the &s;ub|ject&mdash;&s;he will not conde&s;cend to rea&s;on with us&mdash; &s;he will not receive our humble petitions, or even hear what we have to &s;ay in our own behalf&mdash;we mu&s;t implicitly acknowledge her claims to be ju&s;t. And when, my Lord, were acknowledgements of this kind ever forced upon mankind with &s;ucce&s;s? To own the &s;upremacy of the Briti&s;h parliament over the lives and properties of the people of A|merica, or own the &s;upremacy of his holine&s;s over our immortal &s;ouls, are doctrines which can only be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;word and the faggot among&s;t

men who have the free u&s;e of their rea&s;on. But I am, perhaps, going too far&mdash;I mean not to offend, nor would I be wanting in the re&s;pect due to your character and &s;tation.

Now, it is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of all tho&s;e who would be called the friends of arbitrary government and of the &s;aid George III. to render all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power to the afore&s;aid fleets and armies, and to the worthy Lords and Generals, whom this ju&s;t and benign monarch hath commi&s;&s;ioned to direct and manage them.</P>

<HI>Humphreys,</HI> to a friend whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be a tory like my&s;elf: but I had quite mi&s;|taken my man. He had the a&s;&s;urance to addre&s;s me on the &s;ubject in the following manner. I will give it nearly in his own words, that you may &s;ee what dangerous characters we have among&s;t us.</P>
<P><Q>IT has been the policy of every government, (&s;aid he) from the beginning of time to this day, when the honour, &s;afety, and exi&s;tence of that government depended on the fate of war, to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible means to forward and &s;trengthen the efforts of its citizens and friends, and to counteract the force and &s;ubtlety of its enemies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>FOR this end, even under the mo&s;t popular con&s;titutions, many of the &s;acred rights of the people have been hard pre&s;&s;ed, and even &s;u&s;pen|ded, and that without endangering the con&s;ti|tution, provided &s;uch extraordinary exertions of government be manife&s;tly &s;anctioned by the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. The Briti&s;h king, with|out even the plea of nece&s;&s;ity impre&s;&s;es men for &s;upplying his navy in time of war; a practice not authori&s;ed by the con&s;titution, and
<PB N="135" REF="024407_0139_0FC70956F4EAA568">
a high infringement of the per&s;onal rights of the &s;ubject.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE liberty of the pre&s;s has ever been ju&s;tly e&s;teemed as one of the mo&s;t important popular privileges in a free government. It is indeed highly rea&s;onable that the channels of informa|tion &s;hould be kept open and uncorrupted&mdash;and no man holds this right in more &s;acred e&s;timation than I do. But when this privilege is manife&s;t|ly abu&s;ed, and the pre&s;s becomes an engine in the hands of an enemy for &s;owing dangerous di&s;&s;en|tions, &s;preading fal&s;e alarms, and undermining the defen&s;ive operations of government in an hour of danger, ought not that government upon the undeniable principles of &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion, to &s;ilence, by its own authority, &s;uch an in|ternal enemy to its peace and &s;afety?&mdash;I have now in view <HI>The Penn&s;ylvania Ledger,</HI> a paper mani|fe&s;tly in the intere&s;ts of the enemy: whether we con&s;ider the complexion of the paper it&s;elf, or the known political character of the editor. Why &s;hould a dangerous lenity protect a man in the abu&s;e of that very lenity which is his only &s;ecurity, and on which he &s;o ungratefully pre&s;umes? or why &s;hould he, under the &s;anction of one right, be permitted to aim at the &s;ubver|&s;ion of all the other rights of his country?

Would not our council of &s;afety be very ju&s;tifi|able in &s;ilencing a pre&s;s, who&s;e weekly producti|ons in&s;ult the feelings of the people, and are &s;o openly inimical to the American cau&s;e?</Q></P>

<P>THE la&s;t committee I &s;hall mention is <HI>the com|mittee of depreciation&mdash;as important as any</HI>&mdash;they are to take all po&s;&s;ible pains, and to exerci&s;e every &s;ubtile art to run down and depreciate the Conti|nental currency.

They get &s;ome of this money, and run with it to di&s;charge any debts they may have contracted, with a &s;eeming anxiety to get rid of it as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. If they have goods for &s;ale, they openly avow three prices: one, if the purcha&s;er will agree to pay in hard money; an higher price, if in pro|vincial paper, under the old government; and a &s;till higher, if in the pre&s;ent continental bills of credit.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. COLLINS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN nece&s;&s;ity fir&s;t compelled us to take up arms in defence of our country, we thought our only bu&s;ine&s;s would be to oppo&s;e &s;trength to &s;trength, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of war: and accord|ingly, we provided our&s;elves with guns, bayonets, powder, ball, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT experience &s;hews that we were mi&s;taken. Other weapons of le&s;s mortal, but not le&s;s dan|gerous effect, are exerci&s;ed again&s;t us by the ene|my, and we are very deficient on our parts. It is now high time that congre&s;s &s;hould enable us to meet the foe with equal arms. In &s;hort, Mr. Col|lins, we want men of abilities to &s;erve the United States in the capacity of <HI>public Liars.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="024407_0147_0FC709711E03E620">HOWEVER &s;trange &s;uch an appointment may appear at fir&s;t view, we find that the experienced commanders of the Briti&s;h army have not thought it unworthy of their attention. It is manife&s;t that our enemies depend much on their &s;uperiority in the art of <HI>lying.</HI> In the very commencement of the war, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter was at the trouble and expence of &s;ending over a whole &s;hip load of lies in a pamphlet, entitled <HI>An Addre&s;s to the People of America,</HI> to be di&s;per&s;ed among the people. After this, many other lying pamphlets and papers were di&s;charged from the royal batteries. Lord <HI>Howe</HI> &s;ent a lie to congre&s;s by Gen. <HI>Sullivan,</HI> reque&s;t|ing a conference for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace&mdash; knowing, at the &s;ame time, he had neither the in|tention nor the power to make peace. But this was only priming the cannon&mdash;his principal aim was to &s;end a thundering lie to Europe, and particularly to <HI>France,</HI> informing that congre&s;s was about to &s;ubmit, and had actually entered up|on a treaty with the Briti&s;h generals for that pur|po&s;e. And Sir <HI>William Howe</HI> let off another <HI>lie,</HI> not long &s;ince, by means of the unfortunate <HI>John Brown</HI>&mdash;but that mi&s;&s;ed its aim.</P>

<P>I have heard of a man in England, &s;ome years ago, called a Ventriloqui&s;t, who had the extraor|dinary faculty of making his voice &s;eem to come from where he plea&s;ed.

Thus it is with <HI>Humphreys</HI> and <HI>Town. The liar general</HI> is the man with a wonderful voice, and they are only his dogs, whom he cau&s;es to utter what he thinks proper. Thus, in a late Evening Po&s;t, Mr. <HI>Town</HI> &s;eems to addre&s;s the public, in <HI>propria per&s;ona,</HI> in a long declamation on con|gre&s;&s;ional tyranny and Briti&s;h clemency&mdash;All <HI>lies</HI>&mdash;in order to introduce two greater lies, &s;anc|tified by the name of <HI>Jo&s;eph Galloway</HI>&mdash;whom, to tell the truth, I do &s;u&s;pect to be the very <HI>liar general</HI> him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>A REPLY: IN MR. RIVINGTON's OWN STILE.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the printer of the Penn&s;ylvania Packet. <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR paper of the 10th in&s;tant, No. 805, reached this city, and an Adverti&s;ement therein in|&s;erted, and &s;igned with my &s;ignature, hath attracted univer&s;al notice and particular attention, and hath, moreover, rendered me the &s;ubject of much &s;aty|rical &s;tricture.</P>
<P>THE author of this mo&s;t wicked forgery, who|ever he is, hath mo&s;t nefariou&s;ly, and with ma|lice aforethought, made u&s;e of my name as a ve|hicle to impo&s;e on the judicious public the nuga|tory productions of his own flim&s;y brain, as the genuine offspring of my prolific pen. But I do a&s;&s;ure you, upon the word of a gentleman, that
<PB N="171" REF="024407_0175_0FC709E1497FD2E0">
&s;aid adverti&s;ement is <HI>in toto</HI> &s;purious and fictitious. Was the <HI>ultimatum</HI> of the jejune performance nothing more than a little ri&s;ible &s;atire, I had borne the indignity with taciturn patience: But it is mo&s;t patent to &s;en&s;e, that an emphatic injury is intended by this attrocious calumniator. The manife&s;t de&s;ign is to draw upon me the re&s;entment of a people for whom I have the mo&s;t profound veneration, and who&s;e virtuous and heroic &s;trug|gles for con&s;titutional liberty I have beheld with a|&s;toni&s;hment and &s;ecret admiration.</P>
<P>YOU may perhaps, Mr Printer, be &s;urpri&s;ed at this manife&s;to, and exclaim, that there is no con|catenation between &s;uch a declaration and the uni|form tenor and tendency of the Royal Gazette of New York. In an&s;wer&mdash;you are to con&s;ider, that it was my lot to remain with a people who had power in their hands, and money in their pur&s;es. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, you mu&s;t concede, it was the part of a wi&s;e man to evade the power, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s as much of the money as he could. This I have done: I have written and publi&s;hed for them to the extreme&s;t verge of invention&mdash;the Engli&s;h language hath been tortured, and truth expired on the rack, in their behalf. By this I have gained their confidence and blinded the Ar|gus eyes of power&mdash;As to money, let the &s;alary I
<PB N="172" REF="024407_0176_0FC709E2634DC010">
enjoy, and the baubles I have &s;old at extortionate prices, evince that my labour hath not been in vain. Have I done this to the injury of A|merica and advantage of her enemies?&mdash;by no means&mdash;By overacting my part, I defeated the very purpo&s;es I &s;eemed to intend: and the poli|tical lies I daily fabricated, only &s;erved to gull for a time, the fools who thought I was ex|erting my&s;elf in their &s;ervice; till, by repeat|ed confutations they lo&s;t all credit, even in the cities of New York and London&mdash;In the mean time my hopes were rivetted to an event which I fore&s;aw mu&s;t &s;ooner or later take effect; and I felicitate my&s;elf in the pro&s;pect of &s;pending in America, among&s;t heroes and patriots, the ca&s;h which I have &s;educed from the unbuttoned pock|ets of cockaded coxcombs&mdash;in America, the land of liberty, when the &s;torm of war &s;hall cea&s;e, and every man may enjoy the fruits of his inge|nuity under his own vine and his own fig-tree.</P>
<P>I am well aware, Mr Printer, that the voice of your multitude is again&s;t me. They judge from appearances only, and appearances are gene|rally delu&s;ive&mdash;They &s;uppo&s;e that I am the &s;ole author of the inveterate fal&s;ehoods, gro&s;s mi&s;|repre&s;entations, and &s;tigmatic appellations which I &s;o frequently publi&s;h again&s;t them and their cau&s;e

&mdash;Alas!

But I am deemed a tory&mdash;male|volent tory&mdash;and why? truly becau&s;e I have publi|&s;hed tory news, tory lies, and tory e&s;&s;ays in my ga|zette. Granted. But will any one pretend to &s;ay that I have ever refu&s;ed to publi&s;h whig news, whig lies, or whig e&s;&s;ays; I challenge all Philadelphia to produce a &s;ingle writer who ever &s;ent me a whig piece for publication which I refu&s;ed or neglected to print&mdash; I am confident no &s;uch in&s;tance can be found.&mdash; The truth is, I am a great friend to liberty; and have actually felt the &s;acred flame glow in my brea&s;t&mdash;fir&s;t, about the time, or rather ju&s;t after the affair of <HI>Saratoga</HI>; and now again on the &s;ur|render of <HI>Lord Cornwallis</HI> and his army. And if the brave Americans &s;hould pur&s;ue their &s;uc|ce&s;s, and confirm their independance, of which indeed there now &s;eems to be little doubt, you may depend upon it, there is not a flaming patriot in the Thirteen United Sates that will garrulate the charms of liberty with more loquacious zeal than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is mo&s;t undubitably the duty of every good citizen to &s;erve his king and country. I am de&s;irous

<P>&rindx; CONGRESS had, from &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, &s;uddenly removed from Philadelphia to Princetown in New-Jer&s;ey: but, finding them&s;elves but ill accommodated there, they took into con&s;ideration the fixing upon &s;ome &s;uitable place for their permanent re&s;idence In canva&s;&s;ing this que&s;tion, the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern delegates could not agree on a &s;ituation equally convenient for both. On motion of Mr. G&mdash; it was at length determined, that congre&s;s &s;hould have two places of alternate re&s;idence: one on the banks of the Potowmack, and the o|ther on the banks of the Delaware: and it was re&s;olved, that congre&s;s &s;hould not remain le&s;s than &s;ix months, nor more than two years at either of the&s;e places at one time. But as there was no town on the Potowmack fit for their reception, they, for the pre&s;ent, adjourned to Annapolis. This circum&s;tance gave occa&s;ion for the following publi|cation.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE great revolution that hath taken place in America, will undoubtedly involve many circum|&s;tances of con&s;iderable importance and curious &s;pe|culation. None, perhaps, more remarkable than this, that the philo&s;ophical world may expect to be entertained with a phenomenon in mechanics, alto|gether new, and which cannot fail to engage uni|ver&s;al attention.</P>
<P>THE Americans having ob&s;erved the great irre|gularities to which the political &s;y&s;tems of Europe
<PB N="179" REF="024407_0183_0FC709FC2C153B88">
are liable, have invented a method of regulating the affairs of their empire by ACTUAL MECHANISM. For this purpo&s;e an immen&s;e pendulum hath been con&s;tructed, of which the point of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion is fixed &s;omewhere in the orbit of the planet <HI>Mars,</HI> and the <HI>Bob</HI> is compo&s;ed of certain heterogeneous matter of great &s;pecific gravity, called the <HI>Ameri|can Congre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THIS miraculous pendulum is to vibrate between Annapolis, on the Che&s;apeak, and Trenton, on the Delaware; a range of about 180 miles.</P>
<P>IT will require the mo&s;t &s;ubtle mathematical in|ve&s;tigations to a&s;certain the true path of this poli|tical bob: for it is pretty certain that it will not move in a <HI>&s;traight line,</HI> nor in a cycloid, nor in a parabola, nor in an hyperbola, nor in any other known curve; but will have a motion peculiar to it&s;elf, forming a <HI>crooked line,</HI> the properties of which cannot be reduced to any of the rules with|in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of mathematics.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the o&s;cillations of this pendulum will not be performed in, yet they will average equal times. Two vibrations mu&s;t be made in two years: but the&s;e vibrations may bear no determatine proportion to each other; for their relative propor|tions
<PB N="180" REF="024407_0184_0FC70A00C419BE60">
will depend entirely upon the &s;pecific gravity of the bob: which being, from the nature of its compo&s;ition, very variable, will render the o&s;cil|lations equally variable with re&s;pect to each other: and, which is very extraordinary, al|though in all other in&s;tances, the more ponderous a body is, the more it is di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;t, and the &s;horter and &s;lower will its vibrations be when &s;u&s;pended, it will be the rever&s;e in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; for the bob will be inclined to moti|on more or le&s;s, in proportion as the matter of which it may be compo&s;ed &s;hall happen to be more or le&s;s dull and heavy.</P>
<P>BY the o&s;cillations of this pendulum and its <HI>hea|vy</HI> bob, are thirteen wheels of the American ma|chine to be regulated. And, it is expected, that the different combinations of motions, the actings, and counter-actings, the checks, and counter-checks of the moving parts, will &s;o correct and ballance each other, as to produce, in the final re&s;ult, a movement &s;o perfectly equable, that the great <HI>de&s;iderata,</HI> viz. the perpetual motion, and the di&s;covery of longitude, will no longer puzzle the brains and drain the pur&s;es of &s;eekers in &s;cience.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t entertaining con&s;equence of this improvement in politics will be, that it will render
<PB N="181" REF="024407_0185_0FC70A01EA4FF860">
vi&s;ible the locomotive faculties of the &s;everal na|tions in Europe; &s;o far at lea&s;t as the &s;ame may be a&s;certained by their re&s;pective amba&s;&s;adors and envoys. For, as they mu&s;t all follow the move|ments of the American bob, they will do this ac|cording to the genius of the countries to which they re&s;pectively belong. The volatile and active will always keep within reach of the object of pur|&s;uit: the carele&s;s and indolent will loiter by the way; and the dull and phlegmatic be &s;o di&s;tanced, that by the time they &s;hall have arrived at one of the limits of o&s;cillation, they will find it nece&s;&s;ary to tack about and follow the pendulum in its return to the other.</P>
<P>IN order to render this alternate peregrination as convenient as may be to their mini&s;ters, the &s;e|veral governments of Europe are to rai&s;e by con|tribution the &s;um of four hundred thou&s;and guineas for the purpo&s;e of levelling the roads between Annapolis and Trenton, building bridges, and erecting hou&s;es of re&s;idence in each of tho&s;e towns, if tho&s;e can properly be called hou&s;es of re&s;idence wherein the inhabitants are to have no re&s;t.</P>
<P>SOME have thought that when this <HI>mon&s;trous</HI> pendulum &s;hall be once &s;et in motion, it will not be po&s;&s;ible to confine it within the propo&s;ed limits;
<PB N="182" REF="024407_0186_0FC70A0362E3BF58">
but that it will by its great weight (contrary to the u&s;ual laws of gravitation) enlarge its field of action, and acquire a velocity which will cau&s;e it to &s;wing from New-Hamp&s;hire to Georgia.</P>
<P>A further improvement hath al&s;o been &s;ugge&s;t|ed; which is this&mdash;Many philo&s;ophers have been of opinion, that the mo&s;t regular and proper mo|tion of a pendulum would be to cau&s;e it to &s;wing in a horizontal circle, and not in a vertical plane, as the common practice is, &s;o that the &s;tring or rod may de&s;cribe a cone, of which the apex will be in the point of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and the ba&s;e formed by the circumference of the circular plane in which the bob moves.</P>
<P>SHOULD this idea prove ju&s;t (which Mr. Rit|tenhou&s;e has been directed to a&s;certain) the revo|lutions of America will be performed in a circle, who&s;e diameter, north and &s;outh, will be from a point in St. John's river, Nova-Scotia, to the mouth of the great river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, and we&s;t and ea&s;t, from the Lake in the Woods, to an unknown di&s;tance in the Atlantic ocean. The only incon|venience will be the cutting a circular road through mountains and fore&s;ts for the accommo|dation of foreign mini&s;ters and the officers of

congre&s;s; and the providing &s;ufficient &s;hips at the point where the the &s;aid line of circumvolution &s;hall leave the continent, and enter on the waters of the Atlantic, in order that their excellencies, and their honours, may be attendant on this &s;ub|lunary planet in every part of its orbit.</P>

<HEAD>A SUMMARY OF SOME LATE PROCEEDINGS IN A CERTAIN GREAT ASSEMBLY.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;A Member, in the cour&s;e of debate, took oc|ca&s;ion to mention the re&s;olve re&s;pecting the alter|nate re&s;idence of the hou&s;e in two federal cities, and two hundred miles di&s;tant from each other; and although he acknowledged him&s;elf out of or|der, as the re&s;olve had already been debated, and the votes thereupon taken; yet he begged leave to draw their attention to a circum&s;tance which had probably e&s;caped notice at the time, which was this: that the hou&s;e had, &s;ome months be|fore, &s;olemnly re&s;olved, that a certain eque&s;trian &s;tatue &s;hould be erected in the place where the hou&s;e &s;hould fix its permanent re&s;idence. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Congre&s;s had before re&s;olved that an eque&s;trian &s;tatue, in ho|nour of General Wa&s;hington, &s;hould be erected in the place where their re&s;idence &s;hould be fixed.</NOTE> And he reque&s;ted to know in what manner the Hou&s;e propo&s;ed to execute this determination under the
<PB N="185" REF="024407_0189_0FC70A11DDD5FC38">
pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of a <HI>peregrinating</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>per|manent</HI> re&s;idence.</P>
<P>THIS &s;truck the hou&s;e with great force, and many looked upon it as an invincible difficulty; thinking that the two re&s;olves were altogether ir|reconcileable with each other. But the ingeni|ous member, who had planned the &s;cheme of the two federal towns, &s;oon relieved them from their embarra&s;&s;ment by declaring&mdash;That he had been well aware of this objection, and looked for it at the time the re&s;olve in que&s;tion was under de|bate, when indeed he &s;hould not have been &s;o ready to an&s;wer as at pre&s;ent: That he was now prepared to obviate the objection that had been &s;tarted, and &s;hould in a day or two propo&s;e his &s;cheme at large, as he only waited for certain drawings to be completed, which were already in great forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE attention of the hou&s;e being &s;trongly drawn to the &s;ubject of this promi&s;e, he was earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to give <HI>In&s;tanter,</HI> &s;ome idea of his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>THE ingenious member, thus urged, &s;aid that he was &s;en&s;ible his &s;cheme mu&s;t greatly &s;uffer in opinion by being exhibited in a partial, imperfect
<PB N="186" REF="024407_0190_0FC70A134F30C370">
manner. Neverthele&s;s he could not refu&s;e to gra|tify the impatience of the hou&s;e, tru&s;ting in their candour that they would not form too ha&s;ty a judgment of his de&s;ign, but wait till they &s;hould &s;ee the drawings, which would elucidate the whole.</P>
<P>HIS de&s;ign, he &s;aid, was this&mdash;not only to com|ply with the re&s;olve re&s;pecting the eque&s;trian &s;tatue, but to make that very re&s;olve condu|cive to the &s;cheme of the two federal towns. The &s;pirit and intention of the re&s;olve re&s;pecting the eque&s;trian &s;tatue, he ob&s;erved, was no more than this, that the &s;aid &s;tatue &s;hould always be where the hou&s;e &s;hould &s;it. To effect which, nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary than to adjourn the &s;tatue when|ever and wherever they &s;hould adjourn the hou&s;e, which might ea&s;ily be done by mounting it on wheels. But this was not all; for if the hor&s;e &s;hould be con&s;tructed of a &s;uitable &s;ize, and fra|med with timbers, like the hull of a &s;hip, it might be made a mo&s;t convenient vehicle to tran&s;port the members them&s;elves, with their books, papers, &amp;c. from one federal town to the other: and added, that the drawings he had mentioned were de&s;igned to exhibit &s;uch a con&s;truction of the body of a hor&s;e, as might mo&s;t conveniently an&s;wer this purpo&s;e: whereby would be &s;hown the &s;eats intend|ed for the re&s;pective members, the places for the
<PB N="187" REF="024407_0191_0FC70A1981E7DAA0">
pre&s;ident and &s;ecretary, and a little clo&s;et in the <HI>inte&s;tinum rectum,</HI> for the &s;ecret papers of the hou&s;e: provi&s;ion being al&s;o made for light and air, and every other convenience &s;uitable to &s;o great a de&s;ign.</P>
<P>HE confe&s;&s;ed he had taken his idea from the fa|mous <HI>Grecian hor&s;e,</HI> u&s;ed at the &s;iege of <HI>Troy;</HI> and had been &s;earching <HI>Homer</HI> with all his commen|tators, annotators, and tran&s;lators, in hopes of finding &s;ome de&s;cription of the internal con&s;truc|tion of that memorable machine; but receiving no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the&s;e &s;ources, he had been ob|liged to depend upon his own ingenuity, and the advice of an able &s;hip-wright, who was now ma|king the drawings he propo&s;ed to lay before the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS device of the <HI>ingenious</HI> member was recei|ved with great applau&s;e&mdash;but a <HI>&s;till more ingenious</HI> member ro&s;e up, and &s;aid&mdash;that the gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t, had in &s;ome mea&s;ure anticipated a project he had conceived, and was preparing to offer. But as the de&s;ign he had formed was upon a much larger &s;cale than that which had been &s;ugge&s;ted, he &s;hould not with-hold it from the hou&s;e, although he confe&s;&s;ed it was planned on much the &s;ame principles.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="024407_0192_0FC70A1AB336FA28">THE difficulty re&s;pecting the &s;tatue, he &s;aid, had not indeed occured to him; but one of at lea&s;t equal importance had&mdash;which was the enor|mous expence of building two federal towns, when one might be &s;ufficient for all purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>TO obviate this, he would propo&s;e that there &s;hould be <HI>two</HI> places of <HI>alternate, permanent</HI> re&s;i|dence, agreeably to the late re&s;olve, and but <HI>one</HI> federal town; which town &s;hould be built upon a large platform, mounted on a great number of wheels, and be drawn by a great number of hor&s;es.</P>
<P>THIS, he ob&s;erved, would be productive of many great conveniences. It would render the immence expence of building two federal towns unnece&s;&s;ary&mdash;It would &s;pare the trouble and con|fu&s;ion of packing and unpacking, deranging and arranging their books and papers at every ad|journment&mdash;and it would &s;ave much precious time, ina&s;much as there would be no inter|ruption in their proceedings; for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e might be going on, whil&s;t the hou&s;e it&s;elf <HI>was going on</HI>; and motions not only be made in the hou&s;e, but the hou&s;e it&s;elf <HI>make motions</HI> &mdash;&s;o that, with the motions of the members, the motions of the hou&s;e, and the motions of the
<PB N="189" REF="024407_0193_0FC70A1C26C717F0">
whole federal town, all the powers of govern|ment would be in con&s;tant action for the good of the empire.</P>
<P>HE then proceeded to &s;how that &s;uch a &s;cheme was neither ab&s;urd in it&s;elf, nor impracticable in in fact. It was not ab&s;urd, he &s;aid, becau&s;e nature, who does nothing improper, had furni&s;hed many in&s;tances of the kind&mdash;as in the &s;nail, the tortoi&s;e, and &s;everal other animals&mdash;neither was it imprac|tible, as he could fully prove. He a&s;&s;erted that he had him&s;elf &s;een in England an ingenious tin|ker, who had mounted a &s;mall hou&s;e upon wheels, which contained a bed, &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary furniture, and the uten&s;ils of his trade, and was drawn about by a &s;ingle hor&s;e: &s;o that, when he had exhau&s;ted the cu&s;tom of one village, he removed, <HI>cum omni|bus appurtenantibus,</HI> to another; and by that means &s;ecured a con&s;tant circulation of employ.</P>
<P>BUT I have an in&s;tance, &s;aid he, more directly in point&mdash;I mean that of the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia; who, when &s;he removes her court from Peter&s;|burgh to Mo&s;cow, is accommodated with ele|gant apartments, built on &s;leds, and drawn by fifty hor&s;es, over a tract of &s;now many hundred miles in extent.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="024407_0194_0FC70A1DB6295370">BUT it may be objected, continued this more in|genious member, that the&s;e are only examples of a &s;ingle room, or two or three apartments being ren|dered moveable by machinery; but to make a whole town&mdash;a federal town&mdash;an imperial city&mdash; thus tran&s;itory, mu&s;t be totally impracticable, un|le&s;s by the help of art magic&mdash;I am not unpre|pared, &s;aid he, to an&s;wer this objection. It is cer|tainly a mark of great weakne&s;s to conclude eve|ry principle fal&s;e of which we cannot conceive, and every purpo&s;e impo&s;&s;ible, which we know not how to effect. A fool often wonders improper|ly. He &s;ees a jack-weight de&s;cend without &s;ur|pri&s;e, but exclaims with admiration at the move|ments of an orrery: whereas, in truth, there is in|finitely more my&s;tery in the de&s;cent of a jack-weight than in the mo&s;t complicated movements of an orrery.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now undertake to de&s;cribe minutely the means by which our federal town may be ren|dered <HI>itinerant.</HI> This I re&s;erve for a future day; but to &s;hew that the thing is at lea&s;t not impo&s;&s;ible, I beg leave to read a pa&s;&s;age from a book I have in my hand. It is entitled, <HI>A Voyage to the Moon, by Cerano de Bergerac,</HI> p. 112 &amp; 114. <Q>At this our young ho&s;t enquired from his father, What
<PB N="191" REF="024407_0195_0FC70A29A5B7DE58">
was the hour? Who replying it had already &s;truck eight, he very angrily a&s;ked him, how he dared to neglect calling him at &s;even, as he had ordered; when he knew very well the hou&s;es were to begin their journey next day, the walls of the town being already gone? The good man told him, that &s;ince his &s;itting down at table, a proclamation had been made, for|bidding the hou&s;es to &s;et out before the day af|ter to-morrow.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN order to turn the di&s;cour&s;e, I intreated him to inform me, what was meant by the re|moval of the town, and if the hou&s;es and walls really travelled? Dear &s;tranger, &s;aid he, our buildings are of two &s;orts, the <HI>moveable</HI> and the <HI>&s;edentary.</HI> The <HI>moveable,</HI> in one of which you are now, I am about to de&s;cribe. They are compo&s;ed, as you &s;ee, of very light wood: and at the building of them, the architect places four &s;trong wheels under the foundations of the walls. Six large pair of bellows are placed, with their no&s;es horizontal to the wings of the up|per &s;tory; &s;o that when a town is to be re|moved (which is always done as the &s;ea&s;ons change) &s;everal large &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ils are unfolded before the no&s;e of the&s;e bellows, which being &s;et at
<PB N="192" REF="024407_0196_0FC70A2B22DD79E0">
work, di&s;charge the wind &s;o very forcibly upon them, that the hou&s;es are &s;et in motion, and by the violence of the gu&s;t which drives them for|ward, are enabled to travel upwards of an hun|dred leagues in eight days.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>very ingenious</HI> member quoted this autho|rity with no &s;mall marks of triumph, and ob&s;erved, in clo&s;ing the book, that what had been done might be done again. That he &s;hould, however, improve upon this device of his lunatic brethren, by cau&s;ing his town to move bodily, with all its rights, privileges, and appurtenances, and not by &s;ingle hou&s;es, which he apprehended would be apt to occa&s;ion much confu&s;ion on the road.</P>
<P>HE concluded, with &s;aying, that the only thing he &s;hould a&s;k of the hou&s;e would be to proclaim a two days fa&s;t previous to every ad|journment; not only with a view to render the burden of &s;o va&s;t a machine as light as po&s;&s;ible, but al&s;o to avoid too great a complexity of <HI>motions</HI> during the journey.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e was a&s;toni&s;hed at the exten&s;ive ge|nius of the projecting member; and immediately
<PB N="193" REF="024407_0197_0FC70A2CA4101610">
adjourned; having fir&s;t recommended it to each other to con&s;ider again&s;t the next meeting, if any objections could po&s;&s;ibly to be made to the la&s;t propo&s;ed &s;cheme.</P>

But the people, ever jealous of their liber|ties,
<PB N="195" REF="024407_0199_0FC7056F210892D0">
are ready to take alarm on any appearance of danger, without regarding the quarter from whence the inva&s;ion ari&s;es, or the motives that induced it: the robes of office are not long enough to &s;creen the invader from cen&s;ure, nor the &s;eemingly harmle&s;s motive of pride palliate the offence. Are our li|berties &s;afe or are they not? is the only que&s;tion with the people at large. Friends may explain, and &s;ycophants may flatter, but &s;trict right knows neither friends nor flatterers.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I confe&s;s I am no lawyer; and wonder how it &s;hould come to pa&s;s that I &s;hould appear in the Penn&s;ylvania Packet on a law &s;ubject&mdash;but the thing is unavoidable&mdash;as I feel my&s;elf urged by what I conceive to be a &s;en&s;e of duty.</P>
<P>I had, &s;ome how or other, acquired a notion that there were but two &s;creens between the &s;ub|ject and the rigour of the law. I mean the grand jury, and the power of pardon, lodged &s;ome|where in every &s;y&s;tem of government. The fir&s;t, as a &s;ecurity to the innocent accu&s;ed, that he may not be brought to a di&s;graceful, vexatious, and ex|pen&s;ive trial; and the other, a merciful interference to relax the rigid cords of conviction, in ca&s;es where, though the crime may have been &s;ufficient|ly
<PB N="196" REF="024407_0200_0FC705773B7ADE20">
a&s;certained, yet concomitant circum&s;tances may ju&s;tify an exten&s;ion of pardon.</P>
<P>I imagined that the grand inque&s;t of the county, when duly returned, compo&s;ed a body of tru&s;t and power inferior to none but the legi&s;lature it&s;elf. That they are con&s;titutionally independent of every influence and controul in the line of their office, and not accountable for their deci&s;ions, unle&s;s in ca&s;es of manife&s;t corruption and breach of the laws. That they are &s;uperior to and not the &s;ervants of the court, in as much as the court with all its powers cannot proceed again&s;t a citizen, or any individual in the criminal line, without the &s;anc|tion and con&s;ent of this grand inque&s;t (except in ca&s;es of attainder or contempts in the face of the court). For, as to the doctrine of proceeding by information, I do not fully under&s;tand it; yet know enough to hope it, will never gain an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in this country.</P>
<P>I thought the power of a grand jury, indepen|dent as it is, could never give any ju&s;t cau&s;e of jealou&s;y; becau&s;e it is lodged in a kind of repre|&s;entation of the people of the county, if the &s;he|riff does his duty with integrity and di&s;cretion&mdash;in a number of men ha&s;tily drawn together, between whom there could not have exi&s;ted any previous
<PB N="197" REF="024407_0201_0FC705783142B3D8">
collective connection, and, therefore, no danger of collu&s;ion; and particularly becau&s;e their office and power are &s;o temporary that there is not time to form any &s;y&s;tematical abu&s;es of either</P>
<P>I had further conceived, that as the grand jury were impannelled merely for the purpo&s;e of pro|tecting the innocent, by bringing the guilty, and none but the guilty, to an open trial, they mu&s;t of cour&s;e have a right <HI>to make a &s;trict enquiry,</HI> ac|cording to the tenor of their official oath&mdash;that is, to command to be brought before them all manner of legal te&s;timony, of what nature &s;oever, that may in any wi&s;e tend to the di&s;covery of truth, and of the whole truth; and that they may and ought to do this of right, uninfluenced, and unau|thori&s;ed by any interfering power. Becau&s;e, if the grand jury were prohibited from all te&s;timony but &s;uch as the court &s;hould furni&s;h, and <HI>obliged</HI> to receive as authentic, nothing but the dictates of the judges or the attorney general (who in truth ought to be no more than a&s;&s;i&s;tants and advi&s;ers of the grand jury in matters of form only), they would be an unnece&s;&s;ary wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el in the political machine, and &s;erve no purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> but that of giving a legal &s;anction to the will of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he court.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="024407_0202_0FC70579A1A860F8">THESE, and &s;ome other extravagant notions, found my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of whenever I conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject, but could not recollect the &s;ource from whence I had drawn my ideas.</P>
<P>AT length I &s;aw a piece in the <HI>Freeman's Journal</HI> of the 15th in&s;tant, &s;igned ADRIAN; and was horribly &s;hocked to find &s;entiments and doc|trines advanced on this &s;ubject &s;o very contrary to tho&s;e which I had entertained. As I doubt not but this performance mu&s;t have been written by a very great man, from the elegance of the &s;tile, and by a very great lawyer, from the &s;ubtlety of the rea|&s;oning, I began to fear that I was all in the wrong. I thought of it night and day, till at la&s;t I di&s;co|vered tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;tore from which I had taken all my prejudices was clo&s;e at my elbow. You mu&s;t know that we have in the hou&s;e an old folio book which my grandfather had brought with him from Eng|land. My father had made no other u&s;e of it but to &s;trap his razor on the leathern cover thereof when he had occa&s;ion to &s;have him&s;elf; and as it concerned the politics of a di&s;tant country one hundred years ago, and as our family were no po|liticians, it had lain for a long time neglected on the upper &s;helf of a clo&s;et. I recollected, how|ever, that about twelve or fourteen years ago, I had in &s;ome idle hour, taken up this book, and read
<PB N="199" REF="024407_0203_0FC7057FAF13F4C8">
with &s;ome attention a piece therein re&s;pecting the rights and powers of a grand jury.</P>
<P>I hope our new pope is not as infallible as his predece&s;&s;or of the &s;ame name: if he is, my au|thor, and con&s;equently my&s;elf, mu&s;t be greatly mi&s;|taken. I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay which is mo&s;t to be depended upon; but as the doctrine re&s;pects a very important right of the people, I &s;hall con|tra&s;t the two authors, and leave the deci&s;ion to abler judges.</P>
<P>THE book to which I refer is entitled
<Q><HI>STATE TRACTS,</HI> being a collection of &s;everal choice trea|ti&s;es relating to government from the year <HI>1660</HI> to <HI>1689.</HI></Q>
And the treati&s;e which had engaged my particular attention is entitled
<Q>The &s;ecurity of Engli&s;hmen's lives; or the tru&s;t, power, and duty of the grand juries of England; <HI>explained</HI> according to the fundamentals of the Engli&s;h go|vernment, and the declaration of the &s;ame made in parliament by many &s;tatutes.</Q></P>
<P>IN the preface to this book we are told&mdash;<Q>This is a collection that will in general &s;et forth the true and legal con&s;titution of our ancient famous Engli&s;h government&mdash;In particular, here will be &s;een the tru&s;t, power, and duty of grand

juries, and the great &s;ecurity of Engli&s;hmens lives in their faithful di&s;charge thereof.</Q></P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to <HI>Adrian's</HI> performance, I am willing to &s;uppo&s;e that his narrative of the ca&s;e in que&s;tion may be true, not having had an opportu|nity of informing my&s;elf more certainly. All that I know of the matter is that a writer in Mr O&s;wald's paper had pre&s;umed to cen&s;ure the conduct of the chief ju&s;tice in two in&s;tances: for which offence two indictments had been &s;ent to the grand jury again&s;t Mr O&s;wald as a publi&s;her of libels. Had the te&s;timony been &s;ufficient to &s;upport the&s;e in|dictments: had the jury returned them <HI>true bills,</HI> and had a conviction en&s;ued, the con&s;equence would have been, at lea&s;t this&mdash;that one citizen having offended another, would have been thrown into the power of the offended party to be puni|&s;hed according to that mea&s;ure of re&s;entment which his wounded pride might in&s;tigate</P>
<P><HI>ADRIAN</HI> is plea&s;ed to &s;ay&mdash;"For the&s;e <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and &s;candalous libels on the court and the ju&s;tice of the country, which ought not only to be above impu|tation but free of &s;u&s;picion, Mr O&s;wald was arre|&s;ted."&mdash;The&s;e libels, &s;ays <HI>Adrian,</HI> were <HI>fal&s;e</HI>; but nineteen hone&s;t and impartial men, declare, upon
<PB N="201" REF="024407_0205_0FC7058424873240">
oath, that they were not fal&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O&s;wald's publication con&s;i&s;ted merely of a narrative of the con|duct of the court in a particular ca&s;e: the jury on enquiry, found that the narrative was &s;trictly true, and therefore could not find the bill.</NOTE>&mdash;and not only upon oath, but according to <HI>Adrian's</HI> own a&s;&s;erti|on,
<Q>after keeping the bill two days, and hear|ing divers te&s;timonies.</Q>
It appears then that the grand jury did deliberately, and not ha&s;tily, or unwarily, reject tho&s;e bills.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the oath of &s;ecrecy ta|ken by the grand jury, <HI>Adrian</HI> thinks he has fi&s;hed out the rea&s;ons by which they were gover|ne'd&mdash;<Q>It is &s;aid, (&s;ays he,) that upon examining &s;everal other per&s;ons it was made out, <HI>&s;ome how,</HI> that the printer had been mi&s;informed: thence it was inferred, that mi&s;take merely involved no guilt.</Q></P>
<P><HI>ADRIAN</HI> had ju&s;t before ob&s;erved,that the ju&s;|tice of the country &s;hould not only be above im|putation but free of &s;u&s;picion. Now, I am inclined to think, that the grand jury, for the time, more nearly repre&s;ents the ju&s;tice of the country than even the learned judges them&s;elves: and yet <HI>Adrian</HI> &s;u&s;pects that they made out te&s;timony <HI>&s;ome how or other</HI>&mdash;an in&s;inuation at lea&s;t that they had
<PB N="202" REF="024407_0206_0FC7058E580A7AE0">
acted unfairly&mdash;whether they did &s;o or not, I leave to them&s;elves to an&s;wer&mdash;I am not their champion in this particular in&s;tance&mdash;I contend only for ge|neral principles; and &s;hall proceed to &s;elect from <HI>Adrian's</HI> performance &s;ome doctrinal pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;eem to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the tenor of my old book.</P>
<P><Q>WAS there not, (&s;ays he,) the u&s;ual probable evidence for an open enquiry by a petit jury? If there was, why &s;tifle the cau&s;e in the chamber of the grand inque&s;t?</Q>
<HI>Probable evidence,</HI> and <HI>&s;tifle a cau&s;e</HI>&mdash;horrid language! are men's lives, repu|tations, and fortunes to be hung upon the tenter-hooks of logical probabilities: and is the fair ac|quittal of a fellow-citizen from a heinous charge to be called a &s;tifled cau&s;e?&mdash;Oh, &s;overeign pontiff, have mercy upon us!
<Q>Upon this, the chief-ju|&s;tice &s;eemingly provoked at their irregularities (I hope it was in appearance only) a&s;ked the grounds on which the grand jury had proceeded, and how they came to receive witne&s;&s;es not admitted by the court?</Q>
This, dilated into plain language, will &s;tand thus:&mdash;Gentlemen, you are enjoined by your oath of office, diligently to enquire, and pre|&s;entment make, of the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. But, remember you are to &s;hut your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars again&s;t all te&s;timony but &s;uch as
<PB N="203" REF="024407_0207_0FC705902588A868">
I &s;hall &s;end you, otherwi&s;e you may perhaps find this fellow innocent of the charge, when it is my de&s;ire that he &s;hould be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P><Q>THEY declined (or one for the re&s;t did &s;o) giving any rea&s;ons for their conduct, under pretence that they were &s;worn not to reveal the &s;ecrets of the &s;tate, or their fellows; as if this oath re&s;trained them.</Q>
<HI>Adrian</HI> then promi&s;es, that he will hereafter &s;hew the public&mdash;<Q>the true nature and con&s;titution of a <HI>grand jury,</HI> that part of legal machinery, compo&s;ed of unlearned men, (to u&s;e the phra&s;eology of the profe&s;&s;ion,) which is regulated and controlled by the law, as other juries, at every &s;tep, and in every in|&s;tance of their tru&s;t, and &s;ubmitted to the legal direction of the court.</Q>
Ob&s;erve, reader, how irreverently his holine&s;s &s;peaks of one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable bodies in our government&mdash;little reve|rence, indeed, would be due, if they were no other than what he repre&s;ents them to be: I wi&s;h to know what tru&s;t can be &s;aid to be committed to a body of men who are to be regulated and controll|ed at every &s;tep and in every in&s;tance? But let us contra&s;t the&s;e modern doctrines, and this <HI>Adri|anatic</HI> idea of a grand jury with &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages from an author of the la&s;t century.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="024407_0208_0FC70591ACFD0378">HE fir&s;t &s;peaks of the laws and government of England, in general, and gives the con&s;truction of grand and petit juries, but &s;ays&mdash;<Q>It is not de|&s;igned at this time to undertake a di&s;cour&s;e of of petit juries: but to con&s;ider the nature and power of grand inque&s;ts: and to &s;hew how much the reputation, the fortunes, and the lives of Engli&s;hmen depend on the con&s;cientious per|formance of their duty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of government, that &s;ome &s;hould be entru&s;ted to en|quire after all &s;uch, as by trea&s;ons, felonies, or le&s;|&s;er crimes, di&s;turbed the peace, that they might be pro&s;ecuted and brought to condign puni&s;h|ment; and it was no le&s;s needful for every man's quiet and &s;afety, that the tru&s;t of &s;uch inqui&s;itions &s;hould be put into the hands of per&s;ons of under|&s;tanding and integrity, indifferent and impartial: that might &s;uffer no man to be fal&s;ely accu&s;ed or defamed, nor the lives of any to be put in jeopar|dy, by the malicious con&s;piracies of great or &s;mall; or the perjuries of any profligate wretch|es.

<P>HE then goes on to &s;hew what &s;ort of men a grand jury ought to be compo&s;ed of, and in what character the law con&s;iders them, viz.&mdash;Men

<P>&mdash;<Q>I knew too well, &s;ays my author, that the wi&s;dom and care of our ance&s;tors in this in|&s;titution of grand juries, hath not been of late con&s;idered as it ought, nor the laws concerning them duly ob&s;erved, nor have the gentlemen, nor other men of e&s;tates in the &s;everal counties, di&s;|cerned how in&s;en&s;ibly their legal power and ju|ri&s;diction in their grand and petit juries is decay|ed, and much of the means to pre&s;erve their own lives and intere&s;ts taken out of their hands. 'Tis a wonder they were not more awakened
<PB N="206" REF="024407_0210_0FC7059B1D6CC2B8">
with the attempts of the late lord chief ju&s;tice K&mdash;, who would have u&s;urped a lordly dicta|torial power over the grand jury of Somer&s;et|&s;hire, and commanded them to find a bill of in|dictment for murder, for which they &s;aw no evi|dence; and upon their refu&s;al, he not only threat|ened the jury, but a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf an arbitra|ry power to fine them. Here was a bold battery made upon the ancient fence of our reputations and lives. If that ju&s;tice's will had pa&s;&s;ed for law, all the gentlemen of the grand jury mu&s;t have been the ba&s;e&s;t va&s;&s;als to the judges, and have been penally obliged <HI>jurare in verbo magi&s;tri,</HI> to have &s;worn to the directions or dictates of the judges. But, thanks be to God! the late long parliament (though filled with pen&s;ioners) could not bear &s;uch a bold inva&s;ion of the Engli&s;h li|berties; but upon the complaint of one &s;ir Hugh Windham, foreman of the &s;aid jury, and a mem|ber of that parliament, the commons brought the then chief ju&s;tice to the bar to acknowledge his fault, whereupon the pro&s;ecution cea&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>GRAND juries are our only &s;ecurity, ina&s;much as our lives cannot be drawn into jeopardy by all the malicious crafts of the devil, unle&s;s &s;uch a number of our hone&s;t countrymen &s;hall be &s;ati&s;|fied in the truth of the accu&s;ation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="024407_0211_0FC7059CEBCF2DF0">
<Q><HI>THEREFORE every grand juryman is &s;worn as the foreman, in the words following, viz.</HI> You &s;hall diligently enquire, and true pre&s;entment make of all &s;uch articles, matters, and things, as &s;hall be given you in charge; and of all other matters and things as &s;hall come to your own knowledge, touching the pre&s;ent &s;ervice: the (king's) coun&s;el, your fellows, and your own, you &s;hall keep &s;ecret: you &s;hall pre&s;ent no man for hatred or malice, nei|ther &s;hall you leave any one unpre&s;ented for favour or affection, for love or gain, or any hopes thereof; but in all things you &s;hall pre&s;ent the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the be&s;t of your knowledge: <HI>SO HELP YOU GOD!</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>HENCE it evidently appears, that every grand jury is bound to enquire diligently after the truth of every thing for which they &s;hall indict or pre&s;ent a man.&mdash;When a grand jury is &s;worn to enquire diligently, it is natural and nece&s;&s;ary to their bu&s;ine&s;s to think of whom they &s;hould enquire; and it is plainly and ea&s;ily re&s;olved that they ought to enquire of every man that can or will inform them.&mdash;It &s;eems, therefore, from the words of the oath, that there is no bound or limit &s;et (&s;ave their own under&s;tanding or con&s;cience) to any number or &s;ort of per&s;ons of whom they are bound to enquire. They ought
<PB N="208" REF="024407_0212_0FC705A7B52B34C0">
fir&s;t and principally to enquire of one another, mutually what knowledge each of them hath of the matter in que&s;tion before them. The law pre&s;umes that &s;ome at lea&s;t of &s;o many &s;ufficient men of the county mu&s;t know or have heard of all notable things done again&s;t the public peace. &mdash;If the parties, and the facts whereof they are accu&s;ed, be known to the jury or any of them, their own knowledge will &s;upply the room of many witne&s;&s;es. Next, they ought to enquire of all &s;uch witne&s;&s;es as the pro&s;ecutors will pro|duce again&s;t the accu&s;ed. They are bound to examine all fully and prudently, to the be&s;t of their &s;kill. Every juryman ought to a&s;k &s;uch que&s;tions (by the foreman at lea&s;t) as he thinks nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;olve any doubt that may ari&s;e in him, either about the fact, or witne&s;&s;es, or other|wi&s;e, if the jury be then doubtful, they ought to receive all &s;uch further te&s;timony as &s;hall be of|fered them, and to &s;end for &s;uch as any of them do think able to give te&s;timony in the ca&s;e de|pending.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NO directions can legally be impo&s;ed upon them by any court or judges. An hone&s;t jury will thankfully accept good advice from judges, as they are a&s;&s;i&s;tants; but they are bound by their oaths to pre&s;ent the truth, the whole truth,
<PB N="209" REF="024407_0213_0FC705AB1D0BDE08">
and nothing but the truth, to the be&s;t of their own, not the judge's, knowledge; neither can they, without a breach of that oath, re&s;ign their con&s;ciences, or blindly &s;ubmit to the dictates of others; and therefore, ought to receive or reject &s;uch advices, as they judge them good or bad.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE language wherein the oath is penned, is known and under&s;tood by every man, and the words in it have the &s;ame &s;ignification as they have where&s;oever they are u&s;ed. The judges (without a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves a legi&s;lative power) cannot put a new &s;en&s;e upon them, other than according to their genuine common mean|ing. They cannot magi&s;terially impo&s;e their opinions upon the jury, and make them for&s;ake the direct words of their oath to pur&s;ue their glo&s;&s;es. They are carefully to examine what &s;ort of men the witne&s;&s;es are.&mdash;It is undoubtedly law which we find reported in <HI>Stiles,</HI> that though there be witne&s;&s;es to prove the bill, yet the grand inque&s;t is not bound to find it if they &s;ee cau&s;e to the contrary.</Q>

<P>MY author then con&s;iders the nature and intent of the &s;ecrecy impo&s;ed on the grand jury by their oath; which is chiefly to prevent combinations of
<PB N="210" REF="024407_0214_0FC705ABE6BCE690">
witne&s;&s;es, e&s;capes of the guilty, and con&s;piracies a|gain&s;t the accu&s;ed: and then &s;ays,</P>

<P><Q>IT ought to be taken for a &s;candal upon the king, when he is repre&s;ented in a court of ju&s;tice, as if he were partially concerned; or rather in|clined to de&s;ire, that a party accu&s;ed &s;hould be found guilty, than that he &s;hould be declared innocent, if he be &s;o in truth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adrian &s;ays, why &s;tifle a cau&s;e in the chamber of the grand inque&s;t?</NOTE> Queen Eliza|beth had a true &s;en&s;e of our law, when the lord Burleigh, upon &s;ir Edward Coke, her then at|torney, coming into her pre&s;ence, told her, this is he who pro&s;ecutes <HI>pro domina regina: for our lady the queen;</HI> and &s;he &s;aid &s;he would have the

<P><Q>THERE are two vulgar errors concerning the duty of grand juries, which, if not removed, will in time de&s;troy all the benefit we can expect
<PB N="212" REF="024407_0216_0FC705B0035512B8">
from that con&s;titution, by turning them into a mere matter of form, which were de&s;igned for &s;o great ends. Many have of late thought, and affirmed it for law, that the grand jury is neither to make &s;o &s;trict enquiry into matters before them, nor to look for &s;o clear evidence of the crime as the petit jury; but that their pre&s;ent|ments being to pa&s;s a &s;econd examination, they ought to indict upon a &s;uperficial enquiry, and bare probabilities. Whereas, &s;hould either of the&s;e opinions be admitted, the prejudice to the &s;ubject would be equal to the total laying a&s;ide grand juries. There being in truth, no differ|ence between arraigning without any pre&s;ent|ment from them at all, and their pre&s;enting upon &s;light grounds.&mdash;For the fir&s;t, that grand juries ought not to make &s;o &s;trict enquiry: it were to be wi&s;hed, that we might know how it comes to pa&s;s, that an oath &s;hould be obligatory unto a petit jury and not unto the grand. The truth is, that grand juries have both a larger field for their enquiry, and are in many re&s;pects better capacitated to make a &s;trict one than the petit juries. The&s;e la&s;t are confined, as to the per&s;on and the crime &s;pecified in the indictment; but, <HI>they</HI> are at large obliged to &s;earch into the whole matter that any way concerns every ca&s;e before them.&mdash;The petit jury are bound to move with|in
<PB N="213" REF="024407_0217_0FC705B797C1E0F0">
the circle of the indictment made by the grand jury.&mdash;'Tis true that upon hearing the party or his witne&s;&s;es, the petit jury may acquit or judge the facts in the indictment to be le&s;s heinous or malicious than they were pre&s;ented by the grand jury, but cannot aggravate them; which being con&s;idered, it will ea&s;ily appear, by the intent and nature of the powers given unto the grand juries, that they are by their oaths obliged to keep all inju&s;tice from entering the fir&s;t gates of courts of judicature, and to &s;ecure the innocent not only from puni&s;hment, but from all di&s;grace, vexation, expence or danger.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to know what they mean by a probable cau&s;e or evidence, who &s;ay that our law requires no more for an indictment. <HI>Proba|ble</HI> is a logical term, relating to &s;uch propo&s;itions as have an appearance, but no certainty of truth. The&s;e may be allowed in rhetoric, which work|eth upon the pa&s;&s;ions: but courts of ju&s;tice are not erected to bring men into condemnation, but to find who de&s;erves to be condemned; and tho&s;e rules are to be followed by them, which are lea&s;t liable to deception. If the word <HI>probable</HI> be taken in a common, rather than a &s;trict logi|cal &s;en&s;e, it &s;ignifies no more than <HI>likely,</HI> or ra|ther likely than unlikely. When a matter is
<PB N="214" REF="024407_0218_0FC705BA1C4532A8">
found to be &s;o, the wager is not even&mdash;there is odds upon one &s;ide. And this may be very good betting in a Tennis-court or at a hor&s;e race; but he that would make the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice to depend upon &s;uch points &s;eems to put a very &s;mall value upon the fortunes, liberties, and reputations of men; and to forget that tho&s;e who &s;it in courts of ju&s;tice have no other bu&s;i|ne&s;s there than to pre&s;erve them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT hath been &s;aid (in a book entitled <HI>the grand juryman's oath and office</HI>) that their work is no more than to pre&s;ent offences fit for trial, and for that rea&s;on give in only a veri&s;imilar or probable charge: And others have affirmed that a far le&s;s evidence will warrant a grand jury's indictment, than a petit jury's verdict. But nothing can be more oppo&s;ite to the ju&s;tice of our laws than &s;uch opinions. All laws, in doubtful ca&s;es, direct a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of judgement, or a &s;entence, in favour of the accu&s;ed per&s;on: but if this were hearkened to, grand juries &s;hould upon their oaths affirm him criminal, when the evidence is upon &s;uch uncertain grounds, that they cannot but doubt whether he is &s;o or not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>'TIS &s;carcely credible that any learned in our laws &s;hould tell a grand jury that a far le&s;s
<PB N="115" REF="024407_0219_0FC705BAE2BCDE38">
evidence will warrant their indictment (being but an accu&s;ation) than the petit jury ought to have for their verdict</Q>&mdash;<Q>There is no real difference between affirming in writing that an indictment of trea&s;on <HI>is true,</HI> as is the practice of grand juries, and &s;aying that the party indic|ted thereupon <HI>is guilty</HI> of the trea&s;on whereof he is indicted, as is the cour&s;e of petit juries. They are both upon their oaths, which are equally obligatory unto both. The one there|fore mu&s;t expect the &s;ame proof for their &s;ati&s;|faction as the other, and as clear evidence mu&s;t be required for an indictment as for a ver|dict.</Q></P>
<P>&mdash;<Q>WHATEVER ground this doctrine of in|dicting upon &s;light proofs may have got in our days, it is (as we have &s;een) both again&s;t law and rea&s;on, and contrary to the practice of for|mer times. My lord Coke, in his comment on We&s;tm. 2d. tells us, that in tho&s;e days (and as yet it ought to be) indictments taken in the ab&s;ence of the party, were formed upon plain and direct proofs, and not upon probabilities and inferences. Herein we &s;ee that the practice of our forefathers, and the opinion of this great and judicious lawyer, were directly again&s;t this new doctrine; and &s;ome that have carefully
<PB N="216" REF="024407_0220_0FC705C0615D7548">
looked backwards ob&s;erved that there are very few examples of men acquitted by petit juries, becau&s;e grand juries of old were &s;o wary in can|va&s;&s;ing every thing narrowly, and &s;o &s;en&s;ible of duty in proceeding unto truth upon &s;atisfactory evidence, that few or none were brought unto trial till their guilt &s;eemed evident.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEREFORE let the grand juries faithfully perform their high tru&s;t, and neither be cheated nor frighted from their duty. Let them pur&s;ue the good old way, &s;ince no innovation can be brought in, that will not turn to the prejudice of the ac|cu&s;ed per&s;on and them&s;elves. Let them not be deluded with frivolous arguments, &s;o as to in|validate a con&s;iderable part of our law, and ren|der them&s;elves in&s;ignificant cyphers, in expec|tation that petit juries will repair the faults they commit; &s;ince that would be no le&s;s than to &s;light one of the be&s;t fences that the law provides for our lives and liberties, and very much to weaken the other.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH are the quotations I have thought fit to make from this valuable old book; and wi&s;h the whole treati&s;e on this &s;ubject were reprinted.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="024407_0221_0FC705C35AA80150">I &s;hall be told, I &s;uppo&s;e, that this is not law, and is of no authority&mdash;Of this I do not pretend to judge&mdash;but &s;ure I am that it is rea&s;on; and if it is not law, it ought to be. What is generally called law authority is the opinion or deci&s;ion of &s;ome learned judge on the point in que&s;tion; but it &s;hould be ob&s;erved&punc; that grand juries are not like to have any conte&s;ts, nor have they ever had any that I know of, except with the learned judges them&s;elves: now, if the judge's opinion is to de|termine the point and become law authority, there can be little doubt but he will do it as much in favour of his own power, and that of his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>IT does not appear by my old folio book, who was the author of this treati&s;e on grand juries; it contains, however, the &s;entiments of a freeman one hundred years ago; and hath been deemed &s;o judicious a performance as to gain a place among&s;t a valuable collection of authentic papers; and to be particularly pointed at and &s;trongly recom|mended in the preface to this collection.</P>

<P>THE rights and duty of a grand jury and the prerogatives of the bench, are &s;ubjects now fairly brought before you: and as they are of high im|portance to good order in government, on the one hand, and to the &s;ecurity of the lives and liberties of the people, on the other, I hope they will be attended to with the circum&s;pection they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>IT is preci&s;ely the time to inve&s;tigate this &s;ub|ject. We know not what &s;ort of judges we may have hereafter. Our &s;truggles for liberty are not yet over.

<P>A CERTAIN man had an undoubted right to a valuable farm. It was his living&mdash;it was his all. A powerful lord wi&s;hed to po&s;&s;e&s;s this farm, and &s;ent his &s;ervants to take the title deeds by force. The good man locked up his papers in his clo&s;et, and arming him&s;elf at all points, went forth to combat his adver&s;ary: but, alas! whil&s;t he was in the field, the rats were gnawing his deeds in the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>THE common people are afraid of the word <HI>law.</HI> They think it is full of inexplicable my&s;|tery. It is not &s;o in the text; it is too much &s;o by the expo&s;ition. All law is, or ought to be, founded in rea&s;on, and hath for its object the admini&s;tration of general ju&s;tice or the pro|motion of general good. Every man of common &s;en&s;e is capable to judge of law, provided all cir|cum&s;tances and all con&s;equences are made known to him. Let any one be a&s;ked, For what purpo&s;e do you think grand juries were in&s;tituted? He will &s;ay, I do not under&s;tand the law, but I &s;uppo&s;e

they mu&s;t have been in&s;tituted to bring the guilty, and none but the guilty, to a further trial by a pe|tit jury. There is no my&s;tery in this&mdash;the greate&s;t lawyer could not give a better an&s;wer. A&s;k this plain man further&mdash;Why he thinks &s;o? and he will probably reply&mdash;for three rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e it is highly nece&s;&s;ary that the innocent &s;hould have this &s;ecurity again&s;t fal&s;e or malicious pro&s;ecutions. Secondly, becau&s;e a grand jury cannot po&s;&s;ibly be of any other u&s;e. And, third|ly, becau&s;e their oath of office is full to this pur|po&s;e, and to no other. But &s;top, my friend, &s;ays a learned judge, your fir&s;t rea&s;on is good for no|thing, your &s;econd is no better, and your third is flatly contradicted in 4th Black&s;tone, page 300. Let us &s;ee how this matter &s;tands&mdash;a grand-jury-man's path is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>YOU &s;hall diligently enquire, and true pre&s;ent|ment make, of all &s;uch articles, matters, and things as &s;hall be given you in charge: and of all other matters and things as &s;hall come to your own knowledge, touching this pre&s;ent &s;ervice: the &s;tate's council, your fellow's, and your own, you &s;hall keep &s;ecret; you &s;hall pre&s;ent no per&s;on for hatred or malice, neither &s;hall you leave any one unpre&s;ented for favour or affection, for love or gain, or any hopes thereof: but in all things

you &s;hall pre&s;ent the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the be&s;t of your know|ledge: SO HELP YOU GOD!</Q></P>

<P>FOR my own part I honour judge <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> as

<HEAD>A NEW GAME WITH CARDS FOR THE IM|PROVEMENT OF <HI>ORTHOGRAPHY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LET a pack, con&s;i&s;ting of 104 cards, be prepared, by printing on each card&mdash;(with engraved orna|ments, if you plea&s;e) a letter; &s;o that there may be four &s;ets of the alphabet viz. 1&s;t. a &s;et of red capitals; 2d. red &s;mall letters; 3d. black capitals; 4th, black &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etters&mdash;Thus there will be four &s;uits, as in common playing cards; each &s;uit con|&s;i&s;ting of 26 cards, or letters, of one colour and kind.</P>
<P>AS many as plea&s;e may play at this game: but the number cannot conveniently be le&s;s than five.</P>
<P>BEFORE the cards are dealt, every player &s;hould take a number of counters, &s;uppo&s;e a dozen, which mu&s;t all be thrown into a &s;aucer or pool.</P>
<P>THE pack having been well &s;huffled, is &s;et on the table, and the dealer takes from the top as ma|ny as he may judge &s;ufficient for a deal (becau&s;e it may be inconvenient to handle &s;o large a pack),
<PB N="240" REF="024407_0244_0FC70616C747BD30">
and then deals round by <HI>twos</HI> till each per&s;on has got 10 cards. The remainder, if any, he mu&s;t again lay on the pack. This done, each per&s;on &s;orts his hand. The cards rank according to the rank in which the letters they re&s;pectively bear &s;tand in the alphabet&mdash;Thus, an (a) is &s;uperior to a (b), and to any &s;ub&s;equent letter of its own cla&s;s. Capitals bear alike rank among&s;t them|&s;elves; but the lowe&s;t capital is &s;uperior to the high|e&s;t &s;mall letter of its own colour&mdash;Therefore a capi|tal Z will win a &s;mall (a) of the &s;ame colour; but it &s;hould be ob&s;erved that the red letters are always &s;uperior to the black; &s;o that a &s;mall red (Z) will take a capital black (A). The red letters are to be con&s;idered as trumps. There is no other di&s;tinc|tion of powers in the letters, except this viz. that the capital red (W) (which &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by particular ornaments in honour of the name of WASHINGTON) is &s;uperior to any other card or cards whatever; it may be played down at any time the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or plea&s;es, without regard to the lead, and always wins the trick in which it is played; an|&s;wering to the <HI>&s;padil</HI> in quadril, or <HI>pam</HI> in <HI>lu.</HI></P>
<P>THE cards being dealt, the elde&s;t hand plays; &s;up|po&s;e a &s;mall black letter, the next, and all the re&s;t, mu&s;t play a black letter al&s;o, but it may be either a &s;mall or a capital letter. If the per&s;on to play
<PB N="241" REF="024407_0245_0FC7061809ECC580">
cannot follow the colour, he may trump, that s, play down any red letter he has got. When all have played, he wins the trick, who hath played the letter of the highe&s;t rank; the trick mu&s;t then be gathered up and laid by it&s;elf, not mixing it with other tricks that may be won afterwards.</P>
<P>TO avoid confu&s;ion and di&s;putes, it will be be&s;t for every per&s;on, when he plays, to lay his card down before him, and not throw the cards toge|ther in the middle of the table as at whi&s;t; in order that it may be certainly known what card each per&s;on hath played, and who hath won the trick.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t trick being gathered up, the winner leads, and the play goes on as before.</P>
<P>WHEN all the 10 cards in each hand have been played out, the elde&s;t, if he hath been a winner, begins by &s;preading one of his tricks open on the table. If there &s;hould be &s;ix players, each trick will con&s;i&s;t of &s;ix cards or letters; if &s;even, of &s;even, &amp;c. He is then, out of the letters of each trick, to compo&s;e as many well &s;pelled Eng|li&s;h words as he can; but he mu&s;t not u&s;e or mix the letters of one trick with tho&s;e of another, &s;hould he have more than one: And for every word &s;o compo&s;ed he is to draw a &s;take or &s;takes from the pool.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="024407_0246_0FC706199BF1B790">No word, however, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of le&s;s than three letters, and the names of per&s;ons and places are not to be admitted.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>AS the cards are not all dealt out in one hand, no one can tell what letters will be again&s;t him in each round, he will, therefore, be cautious or bold, according to circum&s;tances, in ri&s;king his be&s;t letters. As &s;ucce&s;s does not depend on the number of tricks won, but on the words &s;uch tricks will furni&s;h, each player will be careful of his vowels, without which no word can be form|ed, and of &s;uch con&s;onants as experience &s;hall &s;hew to be mo&s;t &s;erviceable in the compo&s;ition of words. If, therefore, he is likely to lo&s;e the trick, he will throw down &s;uch a letter as he &s;hall judge, from a view of the cards played, may lead benefit the win|ner; but, if he thinks he &s;hall make the trick his own, he will enrich it with a vowel, or &s;ome valu|able con&s;onant, as far as the rules of the game &s;hall permit.</P>
<P>THE letters having the&s;e powers a&s;&s;igned to them, according to their rank, colour, and &s;ize, will admit of great varieties and improvements in play; but as this game is chiefly intended for children, a too great intricacy is purpo&s;ely avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="024407_0248_0FC7062351777750">N. B. The &s;ame letters in any one trick may be u&s;ed again and again, provided they can be made to form different words. For example; &s;uppo&s;e the letters of a trick &s;hould be P, S, E, T, R, C, E,&mdash;they will compo&s;e the follow|ing words, viz. <HI>&s;et, pet, &s;pecter</HI> and <HI>&s;cepter;</HI> and would draw 8. &s;takes, or 16 if they &s;hould be all red letters.</P>
<P>TWO per&s;ons may play, if they agree before hand how many cards &s;hall make a trick; for in|&s;tance, 4 or 5; otherwi&s;e there would be but two letters to a trick, which would not do.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>&rindx; AN act of a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed in April 1782, directing all the trees in the &s;treets of Philadelphia to be cut down and removed; the following publication appeared in oppo&s;ition. THE law was never executed, and &s;oon after repealed.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>For the Penn&s;ylvania Gazette.</HEAD>
<P>LOOKING over a file of papers, which lay on my table, I found a very extraordinary &s;peech, delivered by a very extraordinary orator, in our hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly in April la&s;t, which I had taken down in &s;hort hand, but not from the <HI>mouth</HI> of the &s;peaker. I much wonder that this oration, with the &s;urpri&s;ing circum&s;tances that attended it, have not been noticed in any of the public prints: I hope the following account of that tran&s;action will not be thought unworthy of a place in the Penn&s;ylvania Gazette.</P>
<P>ON the 12th of April la&s;t, the hou&s;e took into con&s;ideration, and debated by paragraphs, a bill entitled,
<Q>An act for regulating party-walls and partition-fences, in the city of Philadelphia, &amp;c.</Q>
when, to the amazement of all pre&s;ent, the bu&s;ine&s;s was interrupted by a voice, perfectly articulate, proceeding from the capital of one of the columns which &s;upported the ceiling of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="024407_0257_0FC706412D1A9D98">THIS voice claimed a right to be heard on the &s;ubject of the bill then before the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e at &s;uch an unu&s;ual pro|digy had a little &s;ub&s;ided, the right of a column to interfere in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e was con&s;i|dered and objected to; and it was urged, that no in&s;tance had ever occured where a <HI>wooden mem|ber</HI>&mdash;a <HI>blockhead</HI>&mdash;had pre&s;umed to &s;peak in that a&s;&s;embly: that this column could, by no con|&s;truction of law, be admitted as the repre&s;en|tative of any part or di&s;trict of Penn&s;ylvania, having never been ballotted for, elected, or returned as a member of a&s;&s;embly&mdash;That the hou&s;e, when fully met, nece&s;&s;arily con&s;i&s;ted of a certain number of members, <HI>and no more,</HI> and that this number is full and complete, by the returns from the &s;everal counties, as ap|pears by the records of the hou&s;e: therefore, if this column &s;hould be allowed a voice, there mu&s;t be a &s;upernumerary member &s;omewhere, which would be an ab&s;olute violation of the con|&s;titution. And la&s;tly, that it is contrary to the order of nature that an <HI>inanimate</HI> log &s;hould interfere in the affairs of rational beings; providence ha|ving been plea&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;o obviou&s;ly be|tween <HI>men</HI> and <HI>things.</HI></P>
<P>TO all this the column <HI>firmly</HI> replied&mdash;That he
<PB N="254" REF="024407_0258_0FC706443B5E16F0">
was, properly &s;peaking, a <HI>&s;tanding member</HI> of that hou&s;e, having been duly fixed in his &s;tation by tho&s;e who had the right and power to place him there&mdash;That he was the true repre&s;entative of a numerous race, de&s;cended in a direct line from the aborigines of this country&mdash;tho&s;e venerable ance&s;tors who gave the name of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to this &s;tate, and who&s;e po&s;terity now inhabit eve|ry county in it&mdash;That he was not only a member of the hou&s;e, but one of its principal <HI>&s;upporters,</HI> in as much as they could never <HI>make a hou&s;e</HI> with|out him&mdash;That he had faithfully attended the pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s, having never been fined as an ab&s;entee &mdash;And that tho&s;e very members who now oppo&s;ed him, had confided in his wi&s;dom and intregrity, by con&s;tantly appealing to him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rules of the hou&s;e are framed and hung up again&s;t one of the columns.</NOTE> in every conte&s;t about the rules and internal economy of the hou&s;e. And, la&s;tly, that as the bill under con&s;ideration &s;o nearly concerned his fellow creatures; and as he found him&s;elf miraculou&s;ly endowed with the power of &s;peech for this occa&s;ion, he was determined to make u&s;e of it in behalf of tho&s;e who could not &s;peak for them&s;elves. After much debate, it was determined that the hou&s;e would hear what this importunate po&s;t had to &s;ay re&s;pect|ing
<PB N="255" REF="024407_0259_0FC7064757B84BD0">
the bill before them: but peremtorily re|fu&s;ed to allow him a vote on this or any other bu&s;ine&s;s in that a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>THE columnar orator, having obtained leave, addre&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e in the following and words.</P>
<P>"I am happy, oh! fellow citizens that &s;peech hath been given me on this important occa&s;ion: and that I have your permi&s;&s;ion to exerci&s;e a power, thus wonderfully obtained, in the cau&s;e of truth and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>"I <HI>&s;tand</HI> here this day an <HI>upright</HI> advocate for injured innocence. What fury&mdash;what madne&s;s&mdash; oh! deluded &s;enators! hath induced you to propo&s;e the extirpation of tho&s;e to whom you are indebted for &s;o many of the elegancies, comforts, and ble&s;|&s;ings of life? If the voice of ju&s;tice is not to be regarded within the&s;e walls, let your own inte|re&s;ts influence your conduct on this occa&s;ion. For I hope to &s;hew that your &s;afety and happine&s;s are much more deeply concerned, in the bu&s;ine&s;s you are upon, than you are at pre&s;ent aware of.</P>
<P>"By the 12th &s;ection of the bill now depen|pending, it is propo&s;ed to cut down and remove

all the trees &s;tanding in the &s;treets, lanes, or alleys of this city&mdash;What! do we then hold our lives on &s;uch an uncertain tenure?

And will this hou&s;e without remor&s;e, with|out even the form of trial, give its &s;anction to an edict, which hath not a parallel &s;ince the &s;angui|nary days of Herod of Jewry! But I hope to con|vince this honourable hou&s;e that <HI>trees,</HI> as well as <HI>men,</HI> are capable of enjoying the rights of citizen|&s;hip, and therefore ought to be protected in tho&s;e rights&mdash;that having committed no offence, this arbitary edict cannot <HI>con&s;titutionally</HI> pa&s;s a|gain&s;t them&mdash;and that your own, and the wel|fare of your con&s;tituents, is nearly concerned in their pre&s;ervation and culture.</P>

<P>"BUT I go much farther, and a&s;&s;ert from your own authorities, that we &s;leep and wake; that we are male and female; that we are married and given in marriage; and that we propogate our &s;pecies to fuller effect, and in a manner &s;omewhat &s;imilar to what you do your&s;elves.

<P>"WE can <HI>conver&s;e,</HI> we can <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> Be it &s;o, Man, arbitrary man, hath affixed certain ideas to certain &s;ounds.

I &s;hall content my&s;elf with reading to your honours a pa&s;&s;age to this purpo&s;e from that ingenious au|thor <HI>Cyrano de Bergerac</HI>&mdash;Voyage to the Moon p. 91.</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;THIS fancy of eating by him&s;elf made me cu|rious to know the rea&s;on of it. I was an&s;wered, that he cho&s;e not to ta&s;te either the odor of meats or of herbs,unle&s;s they had died &s;pontane|ou&s;ly: becau&s;e he imagined them beings capable of grief. I am not much &s;urpri&s;ed, replied I, that &s;ome orders of people here ab&s;tain from fle&s;h and things that have &s;en&s;itive life; yet it &s;eems to me ridiculous to fear hurting a cab|bage in the cutting. For my part, replied the de|mon, I mu&s;t own there appears to me good rea|&s;on for &s;uch an opinion. For is not a cabbage a being exi&s;ting in nature as you are? Have you not both her equally for your mother? and &s;he is more immediately &s;o to the vegetable than to the rational production. The generation of the latter &s;he hath left to the whim of a pa|tent: a rigour &s;he doth not extend to the former, in as much as &s;he <HI>obliges</HI> one to produce ano|ther. And whil&s;t one man is &s;carcely able to get more than a &s;core of his &s;pecies at be&s;t, a head of cabbage &s;hall produce four or five hundred of

its own &s;ort. Should we &s;ay that nature hath a greater e&s;teem for a man then &s;he has for a cab|bage, it would be only with a view to make us laugh; for nature is in incapable of pa&s;&s;ion, and can neither love nor hate. If &s;he was &s;u&s;ceptible of love, &s;he certainly would have a greater ten|derne&s;s for the inoffen&s;ive cabbage, than for the unrelenting man who de&s;troys it.</Q>
And again p. 95.</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;Who has given us the knowledge of certain beings &s;uperior to us, to whom we are neither related nor proportioned, and who&s;e exi&s;tence we find it as difficult to conceive, as the manner in which a cabbage can addre&s;s it&s;elf to its own &s;pecies? To under&s;tand which com|munication our &s;en&s;es are too weak, remember, if you can, among&s;t all the &s;pecies of animals one more proud than the cabbage: who, while you de&s;troy him, is above complaining; yet tho' he di&s;dains to murmur, he thinks, neverthele&s;s, the more. If he wants &s;uch organs as you are ma&s;ter of, formed for wailings and tears, yet he has o|thers where-with to implore heaven to revenge the injury done him, and expects it will not be with-held. It is not unlikely but you may a&s;k, how I know the cabbage has the&s;e fine thoughts? but inform me fir&s;t, can you prove it has not? or that, at the clo&s;e of the night, the Ru&s;&s;ia cab|bage

<P>"BUT &s;till, &s;ays man, we have <HI>rationality</HI> and <HI>ri&s;ibility</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h us from the re&s;t of the creation; that is, when nature gave one man the power to <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> &s;he gave another the power to <HI>laugh</HI> at him. For our parts, we confe&s;s, we never <HI>rea&s;on</HI>; we are &s;atisfied with being directed by the laws of nature, which fully enable us to an&s;wer the end of our creation. We pretend not to be wi&s;er than the hand that made us, and therefore we are guilty of no follies or exce&s;&s;es. We employ none of our powers in devi&s;ing means for the more &s;peedy and effectual de&s;truction of our &s;pecies: we do all the good we can; and when we can do no more, we retire from our pre&s;ent form of exi|&s;tence to make room for our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>"THIS <HI>rationality,</HI> on which you &s;o much value your&s;elves, is, in my opinion, a &s;triking mark of imbecility and di&s;grace, a puni&s;hment inflicted on your race, doubtle&s;s, for &s;ome heinous offence heretofore committed.

the 12^t^h &s;ection of the bill before the hou&s;e is intended to puni&s;h.</P>
<P><Q>The preamble to this &s;ection &s;ets forth&mdash; Whereas trees growing in the public &s;treets, lanes, and alleys of the &s;aid city of Philadelphia do ob&s;truct the pro&s;pect and pa&s;&s;age through the &s;ame, and al&s;o di&s;turb the water-cour&s;es and foot-ways, by the extending and encrea&s;e of the roots thereof, and mu&s;t tend to &s;pread fires when any break out within the &s;aid city: <HI>Be it therefore enacted,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>"YOUR honours have an old &s;aying, called a pro|verb, which naturally occurs on this occa&s;ion: <HI>It is ea&s;y to find a &s;tick to beat a dog.</HI> That is, a man is never at a lo&s;s for a rea&s;on for puni&s;hing tho&s;e who are in his power, and whom he wi&s;hes to op|pre&s;s. But the&s;e trees, it &s;eems, ob&s;truct the pro|&s;pect&mdash;of what? of many wretched buildings and &s;ome dirty alleys. For I deny that any one ele|gant &s;treet or building in this city is more ob|&s;tructed by trees than is nece&s;&s;ary to the comfort of the inhabitants, and to give beauty to the pro|&s;pect. Men of ta&s;te have always thought that a due mixture of trees and buildings&mdash;the beauties of nature and art harmonizing with each other &mdash;elegant architecture di&s;covered through luxu|riant

foliage, compo&s;e an exhibition truly delightful and &s;ublime. But it &s;eems your honours think otherwi&s;e.

<P>"IT is &s;aid, that the&s;e trees ob&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age: but &s;urely this charge is not &s;upported by fact. They have mode&s;tly ported them&s;elves as clo&s;e to the gutters and water-cour&s;es as they can, leaving both foot-way and cart-way free and open. If, how|ever, any &s;traggler &s;hould be found &s;o ob&s;tructing the pa&s;&s;age, let him die the death&mdash;I have nothing to &s;ay in his behalf: but it is farther urged, that the afore&s;aid trees di&s;turb and di&s;order the water-cour&s;es and foot-ways by the exten&s;ion of their roots&mdash;if &s;o, cut off the offending roots, but do not de&s;troy the whole tree. When ju&s;tice exceeds her limits, &s;he forfeits her name. La&s;tly, trees com|municate fire&mdash;Now, a tree hath no greater ene|my in nature than fire: cut him into inch pieces, grind him into du&s;t, it will &s;till exi&s;t <HI>as wood</HI> for ma|ny, many years. Fire alone can &s;uddenly &s;eparate its component parts, and de&s;troy its name. How then can it be apprehended that we &s;hould unite

<P>"BESIDES the charges laid in the bill, two others have been &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t the&s;e devoted trees, viz. that they ob&s;truct the operation of the engines in ca&s;e of fire; and that they are not well affected to the pre&s;ent government, becau&s;e they remained with the enemy when they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city.</P>
<P>"AS to the fir&s;t, little need be &s;aid in an&s;wer. When the ca&s;e occurs, let the ob&s;tacle be re|moved. It is as ea&s;y to procure an ax as an act of a&s;&s;embly; and the removal may be ea&s;ily and &s;peedily accompli&s;hed. But to depopulate a whole city, for the po&s;&s;ible offence of a few individuals, is &s;urely neither law nor rea&s;on.</P>
<P>"IN reply to the &s;econd charge, I would a&s;k, Will any one pretend to &s;ay, that the leaving or not leaving the city on the approach of the ene|my marks the true line of di&s;tinction between <HI>whig</HI> and <HI>tory</HI>?

I &s;ay, the&s;e trees are your be&s;t, your &s;afe&s;t phy&s;i|cians. They have publi&s;hed no books, therefore they have no &s;y&s;tems to defend.

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF A MACHINE FOR MEASURING A <HI>SHIP's WAY</HI> THROUGH THE SEA.</HEAD>
<P>THE errors and uncertainties incident to the mariner's log, are too obvious not to be univer&s;ally acknowledged. Were it not for the ob&s;ervations navigators are accu&s;tomed to make of a &s;hip's pro|gre&s;s by the apparent pa&s;&s;age of the water along &s;ide, and the &s;igns that u&s;ually pre&s;ent on approach|ing the land, the log alone would be a very un&s;afe dependence.</P>
<P>SEVERAL attempts have therefore been made to improve the log, and render its indications more accurate, but without &s;ucce&s;s. All the machines of this kind, that I have heard of, were compo&s;ed of a number of wheels, which were to be put in motion by the twi&s;ting of a line let out a&s;tern, having a drag at the end, &s;o con&s;tructed, as to whirl round, fa&s;ter or &s;lower, according to the progre&s;&s;ive motion of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>THE objections to a machine &s;o con&s;tructed are; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> if the line is not very long, the drag will be
<PB N="275" REF="024407_0279_0FC7068C51631878">
con&s;iderably affected by the &s;hip's wake; and if it is very long, the twi&s;tings will be irregular, and the line liable to kink. <HI>Secondly,</HI> if the drag is &s;o heavy as to &s;ink below the bottoms of the waves, when the &s;hip &s;ails fa&s;t, it will be too heavy, and &s;ink too deep, when &s;he is under little way: or otherwi&s;e, if the drag is of a proper weight when the &s;hip is under little way, it will &s;kip from wave to wave when &s;he &s;ails with a bri&s;k gale, and &s;o be of no u&s;e. And, <HI>thirdly,</HI> it will be liable to mo&s;t of the other irregularities to which the log in com|mon u&s;e is expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE machine now propo&s;ed, will, it is hoped, be free from at lea&s;t &s;ome of the&s;e objections. And although it may not be able to a&s;certain a &s;hip's way through the &s;ea to perfect preci&s;ion, yet if it &s;hould be found to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e better; than any in&s;trument hitherto contrived, it may be admitted as an acqui&s;ition to the art of navigation.</P>
<P>THIS machine, in its mo&s;t &s;imple form, is repre|&s;ented by fig. 1.&mdash;AB is a &s;trong rod of iron, moveable on the joint or fulcrum; CD is a thin circular plate of bra&s;s, rivetted to the lower extre|mity of the rod; E an horizontal arm, connected at one end with the top of the rod AB by a moveable joint F, and at the other end with the
<PB N="276" REF="024407_0280_0FC7068F1E496B00">
bottom of the index H by a like moveable joint; GH is the index turning on its centre I, and tra|velling over the graduated arch K; and L is a &s;trong &s;pring, bearing again&s;t the rod AB, and con&s;tantly counteracting the pre&s;&s;ure upon the pa|late D. The rod AB &s;hould be applied clo&s;e to one &s;ide of the cut-water or &s;tem, and &s;hould be of &s;uch a length that the palate D may be no higher above the keel than is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure it from injury when the ve&s;&s;el &s;ails in &s;hoal water, or is aground. As the bow of the &s;hip curves inward toward the keel M, the palate D will be thrown to a di&s;tance from the bottom of the &s;hip, although the perpendicular rod to which it is ri|vetted lies clo&s;e to the bow above, and therefore it will be more fairly acted upon. The arm E &s;hould enter the bow &s;omewhere near the haw&s;er-hole, and lead to any convenient place in the foreca&s;tle, where a &s;mooth board or plate may be fixed, hav|ing the index H, and the graduated arch K, upon it.</P>
<P>IT is evident from the figure, that as the &s;hip is urged forward by the wind, the palate D will be pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the water with a greater or le&s;s force, according to the progre&s;&s;ive motion of the &s;hip; and this will operate upon the levers, &s;o as to immediately affect the index; making the lea&s;t encrea&s;e or diminution of the &s;hip's way vi&s;ible
<PB N="277" REF="024407_0281_0FC7069A9326D8E8">
on the graduated arch. The &s;pring L always counteracting the pre&s;&s;ure upon the palate, and bringing back the index on any relaxation of the force impre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>A &s;hip going through the &s;ea opens a pa&s;&s;age for her&s;elf, making a hole in the water equal to her imerged bulk. As &s;he pa&s;&s;es on, this vacancy is filled up by the tumbling in of the water from each &s;ide, and at the &s;tern with great violence; &s;o that there is a &s;trong current of water from her bow to her &s;tern, pa&s;&s;ing under the bottom and at the &s;ides of the &s;hip; and the force of this current is in direct proportion to the velocity of her pro|gre&s;&s;ive motion. This machine is therefore ad|vantageou&s;ly placed at the bow of the &s;hip, where the current fir&s;t begins, and acts fairly on the pa|late, in preference to the &s;tern, where the tumul|tuous clo&s;ing of the waters cau&s;es a wake vi&s;ible to a great di&s;tance. The palate D is &s;unk nearly as low as the keel, that it may not be affected by the heaping up of the water, and the da&s;hing of the waves at or near the water-line. The arch K is to a&s;certain how many knots or miles &s;he would run in one hour, at her then rate of &s;ailing: but the graduations on this arch mu&s;t not be equal; be|cau&s;e the re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pring L will encrea&s;e as it becomes more bent; &s;o that the index will tra|vel
<PB N="278" REF="024407_0282_0FC7069DA0820968">
over a greater &s;pace, from one to five miles, (which I &s;uppo&s;e to be a medium) than from five to twelve. La&s;tly, the palate, rod, &s;pring, and all the metallic parts of the in&s;trument &s;hould be covered with a &s;trong varni&s;h to prevent ru&s;t from the corro&s;ive quality of &s;alt-water and &s;ea-air.</P>

<P>LET the rod or &s;pear AB, fig. 1. be a round rod of iron or &s;teel; and in&s;tead of moving on the fulcrum or joint, as at C, let it pa&s;s through and turn freely in a &s;ocket, to which &s;ocket the moveable joint mu&s;t be annexed, as repre&s;ented in fig. 2. The rod mu&s;t have a &s;houlder to re&s;t on the upper edge of the &s;ocket and prevent it from &s;lipping down. The rod mu&s;t al&s;o pa&s;s through a like &s;ocket at F, fig. 1. The joint of the lower &s;ocket mu&s;t be fixed to the bow of the &s;hip, and the upper &s;ocket mu&s;t be connected with the hori|zontal arm E. On the top of the uppermo&s;t &s;ocket let there be a &s;mall circular plate, bearing the 32 points of the mariner's compa&s;s, and let the top of the rod AB come through the center of this plate, &s;o as to carry a &s;mall index upon it, as re|pre&s;ented in fig. 3. This &s;mall index mu&s;t be fix|ed to the top of the rod on a &s;quare: &s;o that by
<PB N="279" REF="024407_0283_0FC706A039730800">
turning the index round the plate, the rod may al&s;o turn in the &s;ockets, and of cour&s;e carry the plate D round with it, the little index always pointing in the direction of the face of the palate. The &s;mall compa&s;s-plate &s;hould not be fa&s;tened to the top of the &s;ocket, but only fitted tight on, that it may be moved at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE then, the intended port to bear &s;outh-we&s;t from the place of departure, the plate mu&s;t be turned on the &s;ocket till the &s;outh we&s;t point thereon points directly to the &s;hip's bow, &s;o that the S. W. and N. E. line on the compa&s;s-plate maybe preci&s;ely parallel with the &s;hip's keel: and in this po&s;ition the plate mu&s;t remain during the voyage. Suppo&s;e then the &s;hip to be &s;ailing in the direct cour&s;e of her intended voyage, with her bow &s;prit pointing S. W. let the little index be brought to the S. W. point on the compa&s;s-plate, and the palate D will nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;ent its broad face towards the port of de&s;tination: and this it mu&s;t always be made to do, be the &s;hip's &s;ailing cour&s;e what it may. If, on account of unfavourable winds, the &s;hip is obliged to deviate from her intended cour&s;e, the little index mu&s;t be moved &s;o many points from the S. W. line of the compa&s;s-plate, as the compa&s;s in the binnacle &s;hall &s;hew that &s;he deviates from her true cour&s;e. So that, in whatever direction the
<PB N="280" REF="024407_0284_0FC706A1269F2D30">
&s;hip &s;hall &s;ail, the palate D will always look full to the S. W. point of the horizon, or towards the port of de&s;tination; and, con&s;equently will pre&s;ent only an oblique &s;urface to the re&s;i&s;ting me|dium&mdash;more or le&s;s oblique as the &s;hip deviates more or le&s;s from the true cour&s;e of her voyage. As, therefore, the re&s;i&s;tance of the water will ope|rate le&s;s upon the palate in an oblique than in a direct po&s;ition, in proportion to its obliquity, the index H will not &s;hew how many knots the ve&s;&s;el runs in her then cour&s;e; but will (it is expected) indicate only how many &s;he gains in the direct line of her intended voyage. Thus, in fig. 5. if the &s;hip's true line of her intended cour&s;e is AB, but &s;he can &s;ail by the wind no nearer than AC: &s;uppo&s;e then her progre&s;&s;ive motion &s;uch as to per|form AC, equal to 5 knots, yet on account of the obliquity of the palate D, the index H will on|ly point to 4 on the graduated arch, &s;hewing that &s;he gains no more on the true line of her voyage, viz. from A to B. Thus will the difference between her real motion and that pointed out by the index, be always in proportion to her devia|tion from the port of de&s;tination, until &s;he &s;ails in a line at right angles therewith, as AD; in which ca&s;e the palate would pre&s;ent only a thin &s;harp edge to the re&s;i&s;ting medium, the pre&s;&s;ure of which &s;hould not be &s;ufficient to overcome the bearing
<PB N="281" REF="024407_0285_0FC706A2B47BC2B0">
of the &s;pring L, and the friction of the machine. So that at whatever rate the &s;hip may &s;ail upon that line, the index will not be affected, but point to O, &s;hewing that &s;he gains nothing on her true cour&s;e. For in this ca&s;e, and al&s;o when the ve&s;&s;el is not under way, the action of the &s;pring L &s;hould cau&s;e the index to point to O; as re|pre&s;ented by the dotted lines in fig. 1. and 4.</P>
<P>AS the truth of this in&s;trument mu&s;t depend up|on the equal pre&s;&s;ure of the water again&s;t the pa|late D according to the &s;hip's velocity, and the pro|portionable action of the &s;pring L, there &s;hould be a pin or &s;crew at the joints C and F, &s;o that the rod may be readily un&s;hipped and taken in, in order to clean the palate from any foulne&s;s it may con|tract, which would greatly encrea&s;e its operation on the index H, and thereby render the graduated arch fal&s;e or uncertain.</P>
<P>FURTHER, the &s;pring L may be expo&s;ed too much to injury from the weather and &s;alt-water if fixed on the out&s;ide of the &s;hip's bow. To re|medy this, it may be brought under cover by con&s;tructing the machine as repre&s;ented by fig. 4: where AB is the rod, C the fulcrum or centre of its motion, D the palate, E the horizontal arm leading through a &s;mall hole into the foreca&s;tle, M
<PB N="282" REF="024407_0286_0FC706A4461DDB60">
is a &s;trong chain, fa&s;tened by one end to the arm E, and by the other to a rim or barrel on the wheel G, which by means of its teeth gives mo|tion to the &s;emicircle I and index H. The &s;pring L is &s;piral, and enclo&s;ed in a box like the main &s;pring of a watch: A &s;mall chain is fixed to, and pa&s;&s;ing round the barrel, is fa&s;tened by the other end to the fuzee W; this fuzee is connected by its teeth with the wheel G, and counteracts the motion of the palate D; NN are the two &s;ockets through which the rod AB pa&s;&s;es, and in which it may be turned round by means of the little in|dex R; S is the &s;mall compa&s;s-plate moveable on the top of the upper &s;ocket N. The plate S hath an upright rim round its edge, cut into teeth or notches, &s;o that when the index R is a little rai&s;ed up, in order to bring it round to any point, it may fall into one of the&s;e notches and be detained there: otherwi&s;e the pre&s;&s;ure of the water will force the palate D from its oblique po&s;ition, and turn the rod and index round to the direction in which the &s;hip &s;hall be then &s;ailing.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be apprehended that the palate D being placed &s;o far forward, may affect the &s;hip's &s;teerage, or ob&s;truct her &s;ailing, it &s;hould be con&s;i|dered that a very &s;mall plate will be &s;ufficient to work the machine. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that one of
<PB N="283" REF="024407_0287_0FC706AD242A83B0">
three or four inches diameter, or le&s;s, might be &s;uf|ficient for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t difficulty, perhaps, will be in gra|duating the arch K (if the machine is con&s;tructed as in fig 1.) the unequal divi&s;ions of which can only be a&s;certained by actual experiment on board of each &s;hip re&s;pectively; in as much as the truth of the&s;e graduations will depend on three circum|&s;tances, viz. The po&s;ition of the fulcrum C, with re&s;pect to the length of the rod, the &s;ize of the palate D, and the &s;trength of the &s;pring L. When the&s;e graduations, however, are once a&s;certain|ed for any one ve&s;&s;el, they will not require any future alteration, provided the palate D be kept clean, and the &s;pring L retains its ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>BUT the unequal divi&s;ions of the graduated arch will be unnece&s;&s;ary if the in&s;trument be made as at fig. 4. For as the chain goes round the bar|rel L, and then winds through the &s;piral channel of the fuzee W, the force of the enclo&s;ed &s;pring will operate equally, or nearly &s;o, in all po&s;itions of the index, and con&s;equently the divi&s;ions on the arch K may in &s;uch ca&s;e be equal.</P>
<P>AFTER all, it is not expected that a &s;hip's lon|gitude may be certainly determined by this in|&s;trument.
<PB N="284" REF="024407_0288_0FC706AE4ADF66C8">
The irregular motions and impul&s;es to which a &s;hip is continually expo&s;ed, make &s;uch an accuracy unattainable by any machinery; but if it &s;hould be found, as I flatter my&s;elf it will, on fair experiment, that it an&s;wers the purpo&s;e much bet|ter than the common log, it may be con&s;idered as an acqui&s;ition to navigation.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be ob&s;erved that in a&s;certaining a &s;hip's longitude by a time piece, this great inconvenience occurs, that a &s;mall and trifling mi|&s;take in the time will make a very great and dan|gerous error in the di&s;tance, run, or longitude; whereas the errors of this in&s;trument will operate no further than their real amount, which can never be great or dangerous, if corrected by the u&s;ual ob&s;ervations made by mariners for correcting the common log.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ingenious mechanic would probably con&s;truct this machine to better advantage in many re&s;pects.

<HEAD>AN IMPROVED METHOD OF QUILLING A <HI>HARPSICHORD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;trings of a Harp&s;ichord are made to vibrate by the impul&s;e of &s;mall pieces of a crow-quill: the&s;e, from the manner in which they are applied, are compelled to perform their office to &s;uch di&s;advantage that many become weak and fail, with little u&s;e, and what is called <HI>the touch</HI> of the in&s;trument, becomes thereby unequal and di&s;|agreeable both to the performer and hearer; unle&s;s frequently repaired, which is one of the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome and difficult operations in keep|ing the in&s;trument in order.</P>
<P>I attempted, two or three years ago, to re|medy this imperfection. My fir&s;t idea was to encrea&s;e the length of quill, that it might act more like a &s;pring than it can do in the way
<PB N="287" REF="024407_0292_0FC706C56AE717E0">
it is now applied. I effected my purpo&s;e, by mount|ing the quill in the manner repre&s;ented by fig. 1. By this means the &s;pring of the quill was advan|tageou&s;ly encrea&s;ed without its horizontal length, which from the con&s;truction of the in&s;trument can|not be more than about 1-4^t^h of a inch. AB fig. 1. is the tongue of the jack in profile, C is the quill fixed tight in a hole punched &s;lanting downwards through the tongue according to the dotted line. The quill is then bent upwards and made to pa&s;s through an|other hole D, punched through the upper part of the tongue, and then proceeds horizontally the ne|ce&s;&s;ary length. This la&s;t hole is made large e|nough for the quill to have free play in it, &s;o that the &s;pring of the quill may be in the curve CD; which will not break or fail by any &s;ervice it has to perform.</P>
<P>THIS contrivance &s;eemed to an&s;wer very well; but it was objected, that the quill being thus forci|bly bent, was apt to &s;pring back, in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;o that not only the point of the quill became too &s;hort to reach the &s;tring it &s;hould &s;trike, but the cur|ved part would interfere with the &s;tring next behind it. And although, in the experiment, this inconve|nience rarely occured, and was rather a fault in
<PB N="288" REF="024407_0293_0FC706C604A6A0C8">
the execution than in the de&s;ign, yet the project was not adopted becau&s;e of the uncertainty.</P>
<P>MY next device was to throw a&s;ide the quills altogether; and taking hard and well &s;ea&s;oned &s;oal leather, I cut therefrom the intended <HI>tongues</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What is commonly called the tongue, I &s;hall now call <HI>the palate,</HI> and my &s;ub&s;titute for the crow-quill I &s;hall denominate the tongue.</NOTE> which I mounted on &s;prings as in fig. 2. Where A is the palate &s;een in profile, having a mortoi&s;e cut through it for the reception of the leathern tongue B, which is moveable in the mortoi&s;e on a &s;mall pin; C is aback view of the &s;ame palate, &s;howing the zig-zag &s;pring by which the tongue is govern|ned. The &s;pring is of fine wire, and is fa&s;tened by one end to the root of the tongue, as at D, and by the other to a &s;mall &s;taple at E.</P>
<P>THIS contrivance produced in effect an admi|rable fulne&s;s of tone, and promi&s;ed permanency, becau&s;e the ela&s;ticity required is not in the tongue which gives the &s;troke, but in the wire &s;pring, which, if properly annealed will not be likely to fail.</P>
<P>THE objection was, that the touch was not &s;o lively and agreeable as that of the common quill;
<PB N="289" REF="024407_0294_0FC706C7861E40F0">
but principally that the machinery was too complex and delicate for general u&s;e.</P>
<P>BOTH the&s;e methods are fully de&s;cribed in the &s;econd volume of the tran&s;actions of the American philo&s;ophical &s;ociety of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by at lea&s;t a partial &s;ucce&s;s, I again endeavoured to attain the object I had in view, and flatter my&s;elf that I have now fully &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ideratum is, a &s;ub&s;tance to &s;upply the place of the crow-quill, &s;ufficiently ela&s;tic for the purpo&s;e, which &s;hall afford an ea&s;y and brilliant touch, &s;hall draw a full and pure tone from the &s;tring, be applied with as much &s;implicity as the common quill, and be permanent in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>AFTER fair experiment and long trial, the fol|lowing method of <HI>tongueing</HI> a harp&s;ichord hath been found to an&s;wer all the above requi&s;ites.</P>
<P>I took what is <HI>called velvet-cork,</HI> of the be&s;t kind, free from dolts, cracks or blemi&s;hes. I cut this cork into plates, about one quarter of an inch thick, and glued upon them thin and well poli&s;hed leather; from the&s;e plates I cut the tongues, and
<PB N="290" REF="024407_0295_0FC702C6280CBB38">
pre&s;&s;ed them tight into mortoi&s;es cut for the purpo&s;e through the palates, in the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame ea&s;e that the common quill is fixed in the little hole punched for its reception. The cork mu&s;t then be &s;haved off underneath, &s;lanting from the point, where it mu&s;t be very thin, to the face of the palate, and then nibbed like a pen to the pro|per length. The touch may afterwards be nicely regulated by &s;having away more of the cork from underneath, if requi&s;ite, with a &s;harp pen-knife or a fine file.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>cork</HI> (as before ob&s;erved) mu&s;t be of the kind called <HI>velvet-cork,</HI> of an ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance, and free from imperfections of every kind.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Leather</HI> &s;hould be thin, well &s;tretched, and of a poli&s;hed &s;urface&mdash;That which I u&s;ed was &s;tripped from the cover of a bound book, which an&s;wered very well, after I had &s;craped and well wa&s;hed its under &s;urface.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE <HI>pa&s;te or glue.</HI> In my fir&s;t experiment I made common glue pretty thin, and with this I glued the leather on the cork; but found after|wards, that in very dry and fro&s;ty weather, the

touch became har&s;h and di&s;agreeable, becau&s;e glue in &s;uch weather becomes as hard as horn. I then di&s;&s;olved a little I&s;ingla&s;s, or fi&s;h glue, in hot water, and with the addition of &s;ome flour I made a moderately thin pa&s;te; and with this I pa&s;ted the leather upon the cork, putting the plates under a pre&s;s till dry: and I found it to an&s;wer well.</P>
<P N="4">IV. IN cutting the tongues from the&s;e plates of cork faced with leather, care mu&s;t be taken that the grain of the cork &s;hall run lengthwi&s;e from end to end, and not a cro&s;s the tongue. The rea|&s;on is plain.</P>
<P>I have found the&s;e tongues to an&s;wer every requi|&s;ite. The cork is &s;ufficiently ela&s;tic for the &s;ervice it is to perform, and affords a lively and plea&s;ant touch. The poli&s;hed leather pre&s;ents a mo&s;t agree|able &s;urface of contact with the metal &s;tring, and &s;hields the cork, which would be &s;oon cut through by the &s;tring. The tone produced is full, and ve|ry pure, being perfectly free from that <HI>clicking</HI> noi&s;e which the &s;trokes of a quill unavoidably produce, and which has been ju&s;tly complained of in the be&s;t harp&s;ichords.

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF A CANDLE-CASE.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of this machine is to &s;creen the flame of a candle from being flaired by the wind in &s;ummer, or drawn by the current of air to|wards the chimney in winter.</P>
<P>THE flame of a candle is at all times much agi|tated by the air. Every per&s;on mu&s;t have ob|&s;erved, in reading or writing by candle light, that the light will &s;ometimes acquire a rapid, vibratory motion, which occa&s;ions the letters on the book or paper to appear and di&s;appear in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This twinkling is &s;o painful to the eye, that the per&s;on is frequently obliged to look from the book or paper for a moment, or to &s;troke his eyes with his hand. The &s;en&s;ation is very di&s;agreeable; and no wonder, when it is con&s;idered, that the iris of the eye contracts and dilates in corre&s;pondence with every moti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the flame.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="024407_0299_0FC702D46D297E30">THE machine I have contrived will &s;hield the flame from the undulations of the air, and cau&s;e it to burn with a &s;teady and uniform light, Fig. 1. repre&s;ents this machine fa&s;tened by &s;crews to a common candle&s;tick. A, the candle&s;tick; B B, two &s;emicircular plates of bra&s;s which embrace the top of the candle&s;tick; the&s;e are furni&s;hed with cheeks on each &s;ide, which are drawn clo&s;e together by means of the &s;crews,C C; and thereby the machine is firmly fixed to the candle&s;tick, and may be removed at plea&s;ure by taking out the &s;crews. (See the &s;emicircular plates repre&s;ented &s;eparate at fig. 2.) One of the&s;e plates has an arm, D, connected with a crotchet E E. In the two ends of this crotchet there are &s;quare holes, for the reception of the long &s;quare wire F. This &s;quare wire &s;lips ea&s;ily up and down through the &s;quare holes; and that it may &s;tand &s;upported in all po&s;itions, and &s;lide with an uniform friction, there is a &s;mall piece of watch-&s;pring, G, rivetted to the middle of the crotchet, and pre&s;&s;ing with its two ends again&s;t the &s;quare wire. H is an arm fixed to the long wire, bearing a &s;mall ring, I; this ring is a little larger than a common candle, and its u&s;e is to keep the candle upright, and pre|vent its falling again&s;t the gla&s;s, hereafter men|tioned, if it &s;hould be too loo&s;e in the &s;ocket, or not &s;et perpendicular in the candle&s;tick.

<HEAD>FULL AND TRUE ACCOUNT OF A TERRIBLE UPROAR WHICH LATELY HAPPENED IN A VERY EMINENT FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not long &s;ince the lady <HI>Penn&s;ylva,</HI> a per&s;on of high di&s;tinction, and much e&s;teemed for her wi&s;|dom, wealth, and importance, was, to the &s;urpri&s;e of every one, delivered of fine boy. She was dotingly fond of this infant; and the more &s;o as the tongue of &s;lander had endeavoured to ca&s;t infamy on her and the child, by plainly calling her a whore and the boy a ba&s;tard. But it was well known to her intimate acquaintance that &s;he had been pri|vately married to <HI>Patrioti&s;m,</HI> a very worthy and honourable gentleman, who was indeed the father of the child. But <HI>Patrioti&s;m</HI> unfortunately died &s;oon after the lady <HI>Penn&s;ylva</HI> was brought-to-bed.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="024407_0304_0FC702F344FE6970">THE untimely death of the father greatly en|deared the &s;on to the di&s;con&s;olate widow; and more e&s;pecially, as the boy bore a &s;triking likene&s;s of her lo&s;t hu&s;band.</P>
<P>SHE called him <HI>Independence;</HI> &s;he nur&s;ed him with care and attention, and endeavoured to pro|cure &s;uch &s;ervants in her family as would feed and tend him, rather from motives of real affection than from mercenary views. But &s;uch di&s;intere&s;ted per&s;ons were not ea&s;ily found. Jealou&s;ies had al|ready taken place. Some envied others for their &s;tations and wages, and hatred and contempt in|fected the family, till at la&s;t the jarring views and intere&s;ts of the &s;ervants broke out into an open rupture&mdash;The ca&s;e was this&mdash;</P>
<P>THE lady <HI>Penn&s;ylva</HI> had hired a wet-nur&s;e for her child&mdash;her name was <HI>Reedina</HI>&mdash;and no one doubted but that &s;he had a &s;incere affection for the baby. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he had but an unea&s;y time of it. Having not the be&s;t temper in the world, &s;he not only had many quarrels of her own upon hand, but &s;he took part al&s;o in tho&s;e of the other &s;ervants; in which &s;he did not exerci&s;e upon <HI>all</HI> occa&s;ions an impartiality becoming the &s;tation &s;he filled in the family. In &s;hort, &s;he &s;uffered her|&s;elf to be influenced by tho&s;e who were not her
<PB N="299" REF="024407_0305_0FC702F6EB506CB8">
equals in abilities; and who made u&s;e of her power and influence to gratify their own ambitious views.</P>
<P>IN due cour&s;e of time, <HI>Reedina's</HI> milk dried a|way,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, a new pre&s;ident mu&s;t be elected every three years.</NOTE> and it became nece&s;&s;ary to get another nur&s;e for the infant.</P>
<P><HI>REEDINA,</HI> though nece&s;&s;arily removed from her &s;tation, was not willing to re&s;ign her &s;way in the family; but wi&s;hing to have it &s;till in her power to &s;hew favour to tho&s;e who&s;e party &s;he had e&s;pou&s;ed, and to puni&s;h tho&s;e who had been too free in their &s;trictures on her conduct, &s;he found out one ma|dam <HI>Potterini,</HI> and &s;trongly recommended her as a fit per&s;on to &s;upply her place.</P>
<P>MADAM <HI>Potterini</HI> was a very good &s;ort of wo|man, and truly attached to young <HI>Independence;</HI> but then &s;he was altogether un&s;kilful in the affairs of a nur&s;ery. She knew not how to dre&s;s the ba|by with propriety; and in ca&s;e of teething, lax, belly-ach, or other di&s;orders incident to the tender &s;tate of infancy, &s;he was ignorant of the treatment proper on &s;uch occa&s;ions; having never had the opportunity of acquiring that kind of knowledge.
<PB N="300" REF="024407_0306_0FC702FACFC87760">
<HI>Reedina,</HI> neverthele&s;s, recommended her in the &s;tronge&s;t terms as a &s;uitable nur&s;e for the child, and got all tho&s;e &s;ervants who were in her intere&s;t to join in the recommendation; not that &s;he thought madam <HI>Potterini</HI> equal to the ta&s;k, for &s;he well knew to the contrary: but expected that <HI>Potteri|ni's</HI> ignorance in the bu&s;ine&s;s of a nur&s;ery would render her dependent upon her for advice in all things, &s;o that &s;he in fact might govern the family as heretofore, although out of place.</P>
<P>THOSE who hated <HI>Reedina,</HI> &s;aw through this de&s;ign, and oppo&s;ed a Mrs. <HI>Richard&s;on</HI> to madam <HI>Potterini,</HI> as a per&s;on better qualified to do honour to the &s;tation.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner was this rival&s;hip known, but <HI>Reedina's</HI> party became outrageous&mdash;every thing that calum|ny could invent, or malice in&s;inuate, was poured forth again&s;t Mrs. <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> and high panegyrics wrought up in favour of madam <HI>Potterini.</HI> The&s;e were all an&s;wered with equal malignity by the partizans of the other &s;ide again&s;t <HI>Reedina</HI> and her adherents. Nothing but railing and reviling was heard in the hou&s;e&mdash;abu&s;e was an&s;wered by abu&s;e, and &s;lander ballanced by &s;lander.</P>
<P>AT length the good lady <HI>Penn&s;ylva,</HI> hoping to
<PB N="301" REF="024407_0307_0FC702FE5CA24AB0">
put an end to the&s;e di&s;graceful altercations, made her election, and committed the care of her &s;on, and the &s;uperintendency of her family to Mrs. <HI>Richard&s;on.</HI> But this determination had not the de&s;ired effect: &s;colding, lying, and abu&s;e were car|ried to greater heights than ever; the &s;ervants were all formed into parties, and the peace of the family was entirely broken up.</P>
<P>NOW the principal partizans had arranged them|&s;elves in the following order:</P>
<P>ON one &s;ide, was Mrs. <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> the wet nur&s;e: to her adhered <HI>Kitty O&s;wald,</HI> one of the chamber-maids; mi&s;s <HI>Jack&s;on,</HI> the &s;eem&s;tre&s;s; <HI>Peggy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> the cook; her brother <HI>Jacob,</HI> the clerk; <HI>Tom Fallon,</HI> the &s;cullion, with many others.</P>
<P>ON the &s;ide of the malecontents, appeared <HI>Ree|dina,</HI> the late nur&s;e; <HI>Thomas,</HI> the chief &s;teward; <HI>George,</HI> the under &s;teward; <HI>Fanny Belly,</HI> the &s;econd chamber-maid; cock-eyed <HI>Moll</HI> and <HI>Doll Frow|&s;ey,</HI> her under&s;trappers; together with <HI>Jonathan,</HI> the late coachman; <HI>Wilkins,</HI> the footman; <HI>Henry,</HI> the lick-&s;pit, and &s;everal more.</P>
<P>THESE per&s;ons, however, oppo&s;ed to each other, equally profe&s;&s;ed a warm attachment to
<PB N="302" REF="024407_0308_0FC702FF36417720">
young <HI>Independence,</HI> and to the intere&s;ts of the fa|mily; but neither &s;ide would allow that the other had any &s;incerity in the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. They mu|tually charged each other with di&s;affection, and terms of obloquy and reproach were dealt about without the lea&s;t regard to common decency.</P>
<P>THEIR di&s;putes and animo&s;ities were at length wrought up to &s;uch a pitch of rancour and inveteracy as to break out in actual warfare:&mdash; but all things in order&mdash;Before a poor mortal un|dertakes a ta&s;k &s;o arduous, he &s;hould, out of decen|cy and in compliance to ancient cu&s;tom, invoke &s;upernatural help: and, if he &s;hould have creduli|ty enough to believe that a&s;&s;i&s;tance hath been grant|ed, and even fancy that he feels him&s;elf in&s;pired, there is no doubt but he will perform his ta&s;k with a vigour and &s;pirit proportionable to the &s;trength of his faith.</P>
<P>COME then, thou heavenly mu&s;e! who ha&s;t a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in de&s;cribing the bloody frays of wrangling mortals, from the famous &s;iege of Troy in ancient times, to the more famous &s;iege of York-town in Virginia, of recent date! Or, if there &s;hould be two of your divinity&s;hips, one more &s;killed in the mortal conte&s;ts of the field, and the other bet|ter ver&s;ed in private broils and warfare of the fi&s;t

and tongue&mdash;even thou, who heretofore did&s;t guide the pen of <HI>Butler,</HI> when he &s;ang the frays of <HI>Hudibras,</HI> with rabble rout&mdash;thou, who did&s;t thy aid afford when <HI>Fielding,</HI> in exalted pro&s;e, de&s;crib|ed the valorous feats of <HI>Molly Seagrim,</HI> in the field of death, or Mrs. <HI>Partridge,</HI> in dome&s;tic &s;trife&mdash;refu&s;e me not thy help! but teach me how to &s;cold!&mdash;Alas! my invocation is in vain&mdash;the godde&s;s hears me not&mdash;I mu&s;t therefore try what mere mortal &s;trength can do; and with no other help or in&s;piration, but what <HI>Kitty O&s;wald</HI> and <HI>Fanny Belly</HI> can afford, mu&s;t venture to proceed.</P>
<P>IT was on a Friday morning&mdash;a day of the week branded with ill fortune from the earlie&s;t times; the lady <HI>Penn&s;ylva</HI> had gone abroad on &s;ome occa|&s;ion or other. <HI>Kitty</HI> and <HI>Fanny,</HI> the two chamber-maids, were about their ordinary occupation, when <HI>Kitty's</HI> bru&s;h, in &s;weeping the room, happened to &s;trike again&s;t <HI>Fanny's</HI> heel, as &s;he was making up the bed: whereupon the following dialogue en|&s;ued.</P>
<P><Q>I think, mi&s;s <HI>Kitty,</HI> it would be well for you to learn to handle a bru&s;h before you pretend to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a chamber-maid in a gentlewo|man's family: and I think it very hard that peo|ple, who have &s;erved as I have done, &s;hould be

<P><Q>UPSTART!

After &s;ome time, E&mdash; O&mdash; &s;et up a like paper in oppo&s;ition, and &s;oon out-did B&mdash; in his own way. Between the two, calumny and &s;lander were carried to greater ex|tent that was ever known, perhaps, in a civilized city.</NOTE> I think nur&s;e <HI>Reedina</HI> had little to do when &s;he &s;uffered &s;uch a mi&s;chievous baggage to come into a decent fa|mily; I know of no good you and your under|&s;trappers, <HI>cock-eyed Moll</HI> and <HI>Doll Frow&s;ey,</HI> have done, unle&s;s &s;etting the &s;ervants together by the ears, and di&s;turbing the peace of the whole fa|mily, may be called doing good.</Q></P>
<P>"GET out, you b&mdash;ch!" replied <HI>Fanny</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT, gentle reader, to avoid trouble to my&s;elf, and not to offend nice ears, I propo&s;e to omit the flowers of &s;currillity which bloomed on this occa|&s;ion;

yet for the benefit of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to have this dialogue &s;ea&s;oned according to the ta&s;te of the times, I &s;hall direct this narrative, in the future editions thereof, to be printed with blanks in the proper places, which the reader may fill up accord|ing to his fancy out of <HI>Tom Brown, Ned Ward,</HI> or the more modern eloquence of the FREEMAN'S JOURNAL and INDEPENDENT GAZETTEER.</P>

<P><Q>SINCE you come to that, madam <HI>Trollop,</HI> (an|&s;wered <HI>Kitty,</HI>) I can &s;oon be even with you.&mdash; Did not <HI>George,</HI> the &s;teward, and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> the coachman, your great patrons and friends, cabal and rail again&s;t general <HI>Worthy,</HI> our ma&s;ter <HI>Pa|trioti&s;m's</HI> chief friend, and now his executor? and did not he &s;ay he ought to be turned out of the hou&s;e? for which <HI>Jonathan</HI> got a good flogging with his own hor&s;e-whip! and, more|over, did not nur&s;e <HI>Reedina</HI> treat with a villain about poi&s;oning young ma&s;ter &s;oon after he was born?&mdash;yes, &s;he did&mdash;and <HI>Peggy Ru&s;h</HI> knows, or at lea&s;t &s;ays &s;he knows, that <HI>Reedina</HI> would &s;trangle him this moment if &s;he could.</Q></P>
<P>THERE is &s;uch an intimate &s;ympathy between the tongue and the hands, that when the former is in full exerci&s;e, the latter cannot long remain inac|tive: for words like trumpets are but preludes to battle. <HI>Fanny</HI> replied only by &s;pitting full in <HI>Kit|ty</HI>'s face: and &s;o to fi&s;ty-cuffs they went without further ceremony, and with as keen an appetite as ever Dr. ***** &s;at down to a turtle fea&s;t.</P>
<P>AS a dog, which hath not only a natural hatred,

<P>SOME authors have inadvertently mentioned <HI>ten</HI> marks of retaliation: but it &s;hould be ob&s;erved that the thumbs &s;eldom do execution on the&s;e occa|&s;ions. Be it as it may, this is certainly a very an|cient method of wiping off <HI>old &s;cores</HI> by making <HI>new ones.</HI></P>
<P>THE noi&s;e of this battle &s;oon brought the family together. <HI>Kitty</HI> being <HI>Fanny's</HI> &s;uperior in &s;trength, and finding her &s;trength encrea&s;ed by pain and rage, gra&s;ped her antagoni&s;t round the wai&s;t, lifted her from the floor, and in the pre&s;ence of the whole

<P>THE company immediately arranged them&s;elves according to their re&s;pective parties, and the battle became general. <HI>Peggy,</HI> the cook, emptied a hot dripping-pan on <HI>Reedina's</HI> head, whil&s;t <HI>Jacob,</HI> the clerk, &s;pattered her with a bottle of ink; <HI>Felon,</HI> the &s;cullion, threw a quart of &s;lu&s;h on <HI>George,</HI> the &s;teward's old &s;carlet cloak; but <HI>George</HI> avoided fighting openly, and only &s;lily pinched his adver&s;a|ries as opportunities offered; <HI>Reedina</HI> attacked nur&s;e <HI>Richard&s;on</HI> with a carving knife, with which &s;he not only &s;la&s;hed her cloaths, but gave &s;ome ug|ly wounds in the fle&s;h: whil&s;t Mrs. <HI>Richard&s;on</HI> en|deavoured to defend her&s;elf with a pillow &s;natched from the cradle.

being &s;u&s;pended, he called upon <HI>Kitty,</HI> and &s;everely reprimanded her as being the author, or at lea&s;t the encourager, of all this animo&s;ity: he reproached her as a virago, a common &s;cold, and threatened to have her well ducked and turned out of doors: he emphatically rebuked her for abu&s;ing <HI>poor Fanny,</HI> the chamber-maid, and &s;wore that &s;he &s;hould an&s;wer for her conduct to her mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t object that drew her attention, was the poor infant kicking and &s;creaming under the cradle, which had been turned top&s;ey-turvey over him. She took him up from the floor, and &s;ooth|ed him in her bo&s;om with maternal tenderne&s;s:
<PB N="311" REF="024407_0317_0FC7032BC95AF560">
&s;he then took a &s;urvey of the belligerent powers, as they &s;tood before her, reeking hot with the fury of battle, and exclaimed with horror:&mdash;<Q>Heaven pre&s;erve me! what do I &s;ee? can the&s;e be the &s;ervants of my hou&s;e? can the&s;e be the cho&s;en few in whom I have placed &s;o much confidence, and to who&s;e nurture and care I have entru&s;ted my darling child?&mdash;the hope of my family?&mdash; Go, mi&s;erable wretches; go, and clean&s;e your|&s;elves from filth, and repair your di&s;ordered dre&s;s; for I will not hold conver&s;e with you in your pre&s;ent tattered and be&s;pattered conditi|on: and &s;ee that you all meet me an hour hence in the great hall:&mdash;but fir&s;t, <HI>Reedina,</HI> give up that carving knife; would you make a &s;laugh|ter-hou&s;e of my apartments?&mdash;oh, &s;hame! &s;hame!</Q>

<HEAD>A REMARKABLE HISTORICAL FACT, Mentioned in the records of the empire of <HI>CHINA,</HI> to be found in the great library of the royal city of <HI>PEKING,</HI> vol. <HI>3458</HI>: tran&s;lated from the original, by an Engli&s;h gentleman who re&s;ided many years in that country, and now fir&s;t publi&s;hed in the Engli&s;h language.</HEAD>
<P>IN the reign of HOANG-TI, who was co-tempo|rary with Noah, a <HI>cacoethes,</HI> or malignant di&s;tem|per, raged among&s;t the officers and &s;ervants of the emperor's court. The &s;ymptoms by which it ma|manife&s;ted it&s;elf, were a mo&s;t licentious delirium, and a virulent apathy, without any apparent cau&s;e of phrenzy, or vi&s;ible diminution of health and &s;trength: the infected violently attacked each other, and even &s;trangers, if they cro&s;&s;ed their way, by di&s;charging, periodically, a black corro&s;ive &s;ali|va, which always &s;tained and &s;ometimes infected tho&s;e on whom it fell, to the great annoyance of the whole court.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON the great emperor HOANG-TI, ever careful for the good of his people, i&s;&s;ued his
<PB N="317" REF="024407_0323_0FC70340D36C1F48">
royal mandate, commanding <HI>Cu-tan-&s;la-a&s;h,</HI> his chief &s;urgeon, and <HI>Poi&s;-on-al,</HI> his chief phy&s;ician, and <HI>Whim-&s;ic-al,</HI> his chief metaphy&s;ician, to take the infected parties under their care; and after ex|amining into the cau&s;e of this extraordinary di&s;ea&s;e, to apply the proper remedies, and then make re|port to him of the whole matter.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of this mandate of the emperor HOANG-TI, many per&s;ons were apprehended, and carried to the grand infirmary. Among&s;t the&s;e were <HI>Chink-Chink,</HI> the poet, who was one of the royal council; <HI>Twing-Twang,</HI> the mu&s;ician, who was al&s;o a mandarine; <HI>Fee-fa-fum,</HI> of the military; <HI>Quil-king-gum,</HI> the &s;cribe; <HI>Ru&s;h-Tu&s;h,</HI> the politi|cian; <HI>T&s;ang-hu,</HI> and <HI>Van-ho-ai,</HI> men of letters; with <HI>Fal-fool-fi-reb-rand, Van-hoc,</HI> and many others of inferior note.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Cu-tan-&s;la-a&s;h,</HI> the &s;urgeon, <HI>Poi-&s;on-al,</HI> the phy&s;ician, and <HI>Whim-&s;ic-al,</HI> the metaphy&s;ician, had duly con&s;idered the ca&s;e, they were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that this di&s;ea&s;e was occa&s;ioned by ob&s;truc|tions in the <HI>pori belarii, ductus hypaticus,</HI> and <HI>ductus pancreaticus:</HI> that in con&s;equence of the&s;e ob&s;truc|tions, the bile not being duly elaborated by the liver, or &s;weetened and corrected by the pancrea|tic juice, was extrava&s;ated into the abdomen, from
<PB N="318" REF="024407_0324_0FC7034A5F811FE0">
whence, a&s;cending through the epiga&s;tric region into the thorax, it &s;oon reached the &s;alival glands, and &s;o mixed with the chyle: that a great part was u&s;ually di&s;charged through the mouth by &s;pitting and &s;puttering; but the remainder being &s;wallowed into the &s;tomach, pervaded the whole circulation of dige&s;tion, and finally went off in foetid urine, or in a clammy and offen&s;ive &s;weat.</P>
<P>HAVING thus di&s;covered the diagno&s;tic &s;ymp|toms, the curative indications readily pre&s;ented, viz. to deterge the inte&s;tines by potent <HI>cathartics,</HI> to di&s;lodge the ob&s;tructions by vigourous concu&s;&s;i|ons, and to open a way for the virulent matter, by promoting &s;en&s;ible and in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration: and after much deliberation, it was concluded, that all the&s;e purpo&s;es might be affected by one &s;imple ope|ration, viz. THE BASTINADO; provided it &s;hould be admini&s;tered to the patient <HI>u&s;que ad &s;udorem &amp; putorem.</HI></P>
<P>AGREEABLY to this determination of <HI>Cu-tan-&s;la-a&s;h,</HI> the &s;urgeon, <HI>Poi&s;-on-al,</HI> the phy&s;ician, and <HI>Whim-&s;ic-al,</HI> the metaphy&s;ician, the patients were forthwith bound hand and foot, and the operation admini&s;tered with great alacrity.</P>
<P>THE effect was truly a&s;toni&s;hing: &s;ome, indeed,
<PB N="319" REF="024407_0325_0FC7034E6C68E580">
required more, and others le&s;s, of the &s;alutary ex|erci&s;e, according to the &s;trength of the di&s;ea&s;e, and ob&s;tinacy of the patient: but in the end, all reco|vered and were relea&s;ed; except only the unfortu|nate <HI>Quil-king-gum,</HI> in whom the di&s;temper was &s;o inveterate, that he died under the operation, be|fore any favourable &s;ymptoms appeared: this be|ing the ca&s;e, it was agreed between <HI>Cu-tan-&s;la-a&s;h, Poi&s;-on-al</HI> and <HI>Whim-&s;ic-al,</HI> that the body of the de|cea&s;ed &s;hould be opened, in order to a more certain di&s;covery of the nature of this extraordinary di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS was accordingly done, and the&s;e learned men having made the inve&s;tigation with great &s;kill and attention, formed a report of the ca&s;e, and laid the &s;ame before the emperor, in obedience to his royal mandate.</P>

in good decent language. The&s;e were bold &s;trokes in literature. But our author out&s;trips them far. That intelligent beings, under any form of exi&s;t|ence, &s;hould be capable of a mutual communica|tion of ideas, is not an ab&s;urd or improbable &s;uppo|&s;ition. That the brute &s;pecies, manife&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ideas and furni&s;hed with at lea&s;t apparent or|gans of &s;peech, might maintain a friendly conver&s;a|tion is not difficult to conceive: but that dead carca&s;es &s;hould utter &s;entiments, and hold recipro|cal intercour&s;e, &s;eems to be a &s;hocking violation of the bounds of probability. Our author, how|ever, attempts to ju&s;tify the ground he hath cho|&s;en by a &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, whim&s;ical enough, of which the principal outlines are the&s;e.</P>
<P>HE &s;tates the po&s;ition, that whatever <HI>exi&s;ts</HI> hath <HI>identity,</HI> or that which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from another being however &s;imilar. That bodies are &s;en&s;ible of their <HI>identity,</HI> which is manife&s;ted by the re&s;i&s;tance they make to any change of form, or to any diminution or addition of &s;ub&s;tance. That all material bodies have atmo&s;pheres adhering to their &s;uperficies, or rather that tho&s;e atmo&s;pheres are the component parts of the bodies them&s;elves, expanded and rarefied to an imperceptible degree of finene&s;s. So that bodies have, in fact, no per|ceptible out-lines. What appears to us, he &s;ays,
<PB N="329" REF="024407_0335_0FC703722A931FC8">
to be the external outlines of any body, is no|thing more than that line of divi&s;ion in its atmo|&s;phere which &s;eparates tho&s;e particles which are gro&s;s enough to become the objects of vi&s;ion, from tho&s;e which are too refined for that purpo&s;e. And therefore, he infers, to no two men does the &s;ame object appear of equal magnitude, unle&s;s their eyes &s;hould be formed exactly alike, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of preci&s;ely equal powers. From which he concludes, that no one can certainly &s;ay <HI>here</HI> this body <HI>is,</HI> but <HI>there</HI> it <HI>is not.</HI></P>
<P>HE a&s;&s;erts further, that the&s;e atmo&s;pheres, &s;ur|rounding not only the whole, but every molicule of a body, mu&s;t ever prevent an actual contact of parts however clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed together; and there|fore, there is not to be found in all nature a truly &s;olid body. That when bodies lye &s;o near each other that their atmo&s;pheres interfere, there mu&s;t be an actual intercour&s;e of parts between them, of which they are more or le&s;s &s;en&s;ible according to the vigour and activity of their re&s;pective atmo|&s;pheres.

<P>I will inform you. It has been di&s;cover|ed, and proved, particularly by a <HI>Doctor Alex|ander,</HI> profe&s;&s;or in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> that filth, na&s;ti|ne&s;s, and corruption, are the only &s;ure pre&s;ervers of health. He made numberle&s;s experiments to a&s;certain this truth. He procured &s;ome of the li|quor from a pool near Edinburgh, into which the carca&s;es of dogs, cats, hor&s;es, &amp;c. and the general filth of the city are u&s;ually thrown. This he put into a gla&s;s, vi&s;cous, green, and frothy, as he found it: he took al&s;o &s;ome fair &s;pring water and put it into another gla&s;s. Two pieces of fre&s;h meat were &s;u&s;pended in the&s;e waters, and placed in the &s;ame degree of heat. In a few hours, the meat immer&s;ed in fair water began to &s;mell offen|&s;ive, and &s;oon after became putre&s;cent; whil&s;t the other remained &s;weet for &s;everal days; and, be|ing broiled on the coals, made an excellent &s;teak for the curious doctor to regale him&s;elf withal. Convinced by this experiment, our commi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="332" REF="024407_0338_0FC70378B3863368">
have directed as many carca&s;es, and as much filth as can be collected, to be di&s;per&s;ed through the &s;treets of this city. And it is owing to their attention that there is now no &s;treet or alley without at lea&s;t a rea&s;onable &s;upply of putre&s;cent matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! but I am &s;ure there is a law for clean&s;ing, pitching and paving the &s;treets of this city, and a pretty heavy tax levied for the purpo&s;e. I am &s;ure I have heard my ma&s;ter cur&s;e and &s;wear bitterly whil&s;t he paid it. Pray, what becomes of all that money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What becomes of it! The commi&s;&s;ioners pay it away in premiums to boys who kill cats for the &s;upply of this large city. Only con&s;ider&mdash;there are at this time not le&s;s than three hundred dead cats lying in our &s;treets and alleys. But, alas! what is a poor cat?&mdash;not made of &s;teel&mdash;&s;he cannot la&s;t forever&mdash;continually run over by waggons laden with cord-wood&mdash;by drays, carts, coaches, and and chains, and perpetually kicked about by hor&s;es' hoofs. I &s;uppo&s;e the olde&s;t and toughe&s;t ram-cat that can be got will not wear more than a month. Well! three hundred cats per month make three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred nece&s;&s;ary for the an|nual &s;upply of this city&mdash;and the&s;e are not to be

had gratis. The time is not far off when the le|gi&s;lature will find it nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a law for en|couraging the breed of cats, and even allow a hand&s;ome bounty on their importation. Our worthy &s;treet commi&s;&s;ioners already find cats &s;o &s;carce, that they are &s;ometimes obliged to put the city to an allowance. But they make up the defi|ciency, by encouraging hou&s;ekeepers to throw in|to the &s;treets, all the offals of their kitchens; &s;uch as guts, garbage, bones, feathers, oy&s;ter-&s;hells, &amp;c. And they allow the &s;oap-boiler to pile up before his door, the dregs of his trade&mdash; the &s;tinking &s;kimmings of putrid fat, and the <HI>ca|put-mortuum</HI> of a whole winter's firing.</P>

<P>This &s;y&s;tem of police is entirely new to me, and I believe not generally under&s;tood. I have known many to cur&s;e the commi&s;&s;ioners for the dirtine&s;s of our &s;treets, and pay with grudg|ing a tax for which they &s;ay there is not value received.</P>

<P>Mere effects of ignorance and prejudice! It is now known to the learned, that the volatile &s;alts ari&s;ing from putre&s;cent &s;ub&s;tances are the mo&s;t powerful anti&s;eptics in nature.

is part of the religion of a Mahometan&mdash;but Chri&s;tians know better. The king of <HI>Spain</HI> once undertook to clean&s;e the &s;treets of <HI>Madrid,</HI> by or|dering the inhabitants to accommodate them&s;elves with <HI>nece&s;&s;aries;</HI> but this had well nigh cau&s;ed an in&s;urrection in that great city. And the phy&s;i|cians, one and all, joined in a remon&s;trance to the crown, declaring that the health of the inhabi|tants depended upon there being a &s;ufficient quan|tity of human ordure &s;pread over the &s;treets of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>MANY of the good people, who live on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Front Street, between Arch and Vine Streets, hold the &s;ame philo&s;ophical creed. Who|ever will &s;troll through that neighbourhood, from ten to twelve o'clock at night, (whether he goes along Front or Water Streets) will not fail to &s;ee the nymphs ru&s;h &s;uddenly out, and pour forth plentiful libations to the godde&s;s <HI>Cloacina</HI> from their &s;acred urns. And whoever walks that way early in the morning, might &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Jupiter,</HI> enamoured with the <HI>Danaes</HI> of that di&s;trict, had again de&s;cended in a golden &s;hower. Delicate con&s;titutions, &s;ubject to nervous and hy&s;terical af|fections, are &s;ure of finding relief by taking the air of that neighbourhood.

walk that way to procure an appetite for breakfa&s;t. Moreover, it is expected, that as the &s;ea&s;on advances, the urinous &s;alts will be &s;o &s;ubli|med by the heats of the &s;ummer &s;un, as to ge|nerate a natural pho&s;phorus: in which ca&s;e that neighbourhood will apply for an exemption from the lamp-tax as an unnece&s;&s;ary impo&s;ition on that part of the city, who&s;e inhabitants, like the fru|gal fire-fly, can furni&s;h light from their own tails.</P>

Be&s;ides, a coach cannot run far without encountering the body of a cat: the wheels mu&s;t unavoidably break three or four ribs of the carca&s;e, and this will af|ford an agreeable <HI>cra&s;h,</HI> to the great amu&s;ement of the ladies and gentlemen within.</P>

<P>Only this: it is whi&s;pered that the &s;treet commi&s;&s;ioners hold a monthly fea&s;t; at which the principal di&s;h is two large ram-cats, &s;mothered in onions.

viz. the triangle ABC is equal to the other equal part or triangle BCD; and further, that tho&s;e two triangles are not only equal, but &s;imilar. For by the 105^t^h propo&s;ition of the 49^t^h book of <HI>Euclid,</HI> if in two triangles, all the lines and angles of the one, are equal to all the corre&s;ponding lines and angles of the other, tho&s;e two triangles will be equal and &s;imilar.

Now, becau&s;e by the 115^t^h pro|po&s;ition of the &s;ame book, equal legs &s;ubtend e|qual angles of the &s;ame radii; it follows, that all the angles of the triangle ABC are equal to the corre&s;ponding angles of the triangle BDC: <HI>ergo,</HI> tho&s;e two triangles are equal and &s;imilar: and <HI>ergo,</HI> if a &s;quare be cut by a diagonal line into two equal parts, tho&s;e parts will be equal.

<P>HAVING ob&s;erved, with real concern, the &s;tate of &s;upinene&s;s and neglect into which this &s;o|ciety &s;eems to have fallen, I cannot &s;uppre&s;s the zeal that urges me to attempt &s;omething that may draw your attention to the important purpo&s;es for which the legi&s;lature hath incorporated you as a philo&s;ophical &s;ociety, and to propo&s;e &s;ome regu|gulations which may, in my opinion, prove benefi|cial to this in&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="024407_0366_0FC703F69BD8F7A0">PREVIOUS to the late war our &s;ociety was ma|king con&s;iderable progre&s;s towards becoming u&s;e|ful and famous: it had already attracted the notice of learned men in Europe. The communica|tions, by members at home and abroad were fre|quent and valuable; &s;o that in its infant &s;tate, it was enabled to publi&s;h a volume of tran&s;actions which &s;tamped a credit on the &s;ociety, and made it an object worthy of public encouragement.</P>
<P>THIS fair pro&s;pect, however, was totally over|ca&s;t by the dreary tempe&s;t of war. The &s;till voice of philo&s;ophy could not be heard amid&s;t the ho&s;tile din of arms, the thunder of the cannon, and the horrible confu&s;ion of ravaged countries and plun|dered cities.</P>
<P>BY the ble&s;&s;ing of Almighty God, the prudent and heroic conduct of the citizens and &s;oldiers of America, and the friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a powerful ally, this war, which threatened &s;o loudly, hath terminated in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our indepen|dance, and a peace highly honourable and advan|tageous to us.</P>
<P>IT is now time&mdash;it is high time&mdash;that philo&s;ophy &s;hould again lift up her head. Political &s;overeignty being thus &s;ecured to us, the eyes of Europe are
<PB N="361" REF="024407_0367_0FC70401350FC550">
turned towards America&mdash;And with what view? Not altogether to contemplate the peculiarities of our government. If our &s;y&s;tems &s;hould be bad, we &s;hall be the chief &s;ufferers; if they are wi&s;e and good, we &s;hall reap the chief advantage&mdash; foreign nations are not directly intere&s;ted in this &s;peculation. But they look towards us as a coun|try that may be a great nur&s;ery of arts and &s;cien|ces&mdash;As a country affording an exten&s;ive field of improvement in agriculture, natural hi&s;tory, and other branches of u&s;eful knowledge. They look to tho&s;e future philo&s;ophers, who &s;hall &s;earch nature in her hidden rece&s;&s;es; in regions yet unexplored; in depths and caverns, which the light of day hath never yet illumined.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner were the glad tidings of peace an|nounced, but many of the literati of Europe were ha&s;ty to encourage our pur&s;uits by their friendly notice. The many letters, with pre&s;ents of u&s;eful and curious books we have lately received, evince this.</P>
<P>IN what an intere&s;ting &s;ituation, then, are we placed? And in this intere&s;ting &s;ituation permit me to a&s;k, what are we doing? I am truly &s;orry that the an&s;wer to this que&s;tion &s;hould amount to little more than this&mdash;we are returning very civil

<P>IT may, indeed, rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that e|very citizen of America mu&s;t find him&s;elf intimately intere&s;ted in the political concerns of his country; left in an un&s;ettled &s;tate by the confu&s;ions of war; and deeply engaged in the arrangement and e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a new empire, to which the late im|portant revolution hath given birth.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e excu&s;es, however &s;ub&s;tantial, cannot avail us long. If it &s;hall be perceived, that year after year elap&s;es, and nothing intere&s;ting is pro|duced, no di&s;coveries made, or even attempted to be made: when it &s;hall be perceived, that our barrenne&s;s mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned, either by a want of abilities, or which is, indeed, the truth, by a &s;hameful want of attention, we mu&s;t unavoidably &s;ink into contempt: and when this &s;hall be the ca&s;e&mdash;I will venture to prophe&s;y&mdash;<HI>this</HI> &s;ociety will never regain its lo&s;t ground. Some other future philo&s;ophical &s;ociety, better modelled, and compo&s;|ed of more zealous members, may ri&s;e into notice, and become u&s;eful: but this &s;ociety will &s;ink into oblivion.</P>

from &s;uch di&s;grace; but as I apprehend we are rather verging towards it, my concern would not &s;uffer me to withhold this warning.</P>
<P>To prove that my fears are not altogether with|out foundation, I appeal to three notorious cir|cum&s;tances; our &s;hameful neglect of the &s;tated meetings of the &s;ociety, the great &s;carcity of phi|lo&s;ophical communications, and the tenor and com|plexion of our book of minutes.</P>
<P>NEVER was there an aera in which philo&s;ophi|cal pur&s;uits were more encouraged, or pu&s;hed with more &s;ucce&s;s, than the pre&s;ent. The di&s;coveries which have been made in every part of Europe, are mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important. Some have contrived means to &s;eparate the different kinds of air, compounded in bodies, and to inve&s;tigate and prove experimentally their re&s;pective properties: others have plunged, as it were, into the element of fire, to &s;earch out its &s;ubtle powers, and deve|lope that great &s;ecret of nature, the generation of animal heat: &s;ome are pur&s;uing electrical experi|ments, with the mo&s;t promi&s;ing a&s;&s;iduity: others are adding new worlds to our &s;y&s;tem: and others, on principles hitherto undi&s;covered, &s;end up the va&s;t balloon, and float in regions deemed inacce&s;&s;ible to man.</P>

The po&s;ition is not true in rea&s;on; for the language of nature is not written in Hebrew or Greek; the under&s;tanding thereof is not involv|ed in the contemptible quirks of logic, nor wrapt in the vi&s;ionary clouds of metaphy&s;ical hypothe&s;is. The great book of nature is open to all&mdash;all may read therein&mdash;and who can read and under&s;tand, without wor&s;hipping the God of nature, who thus manife&s;ts him&s;elf in the &s;implicity and power of his works?</P>
<P>THE idolatrous veneration heretofore paid to the theoretical philo&s;ophy of tho&s;e &s;ages, who de|rive half their reputation from the gro&s;s ignorance of the ages in which they lived, is now in a great mea&s;ure done away: men begin, without fear of condemnation, to lay a&s;ide faith in philo&s;ophy, and bring doctrines to the te&s;t of fact. The impene|trable my&s;teries and &s;upernatural influences of chymi&s;try have vani&s;hed with the &s;moke of the fur|nace, and we &s;ee that chymical proce&s;&s;es are gover|ned by the unalterable mechanical laws of nature, which want nothing but fair inve&s;tigation to be under&s;tood.

The mo|dern phy&s;ician &s;implifies his practice, by attending to nature and fact, and following their indications in preference to the dictates of <HI>Galen.</HI> In a word, men do not now, as heretofore, act peremptorily on what may appear to be rea&s;on; but rea&s;on cautiou&s;ly on what appears to be fact: and this mu&s;t &s;urely be the right and &s;afe road to the know|ledge of truth.</P>
<P>WHAT a glorious aera for the advancement of true philo&s;ophy! The road to knowledge laid open, and the fa&s;hion of the times leading into it.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of &s;uch advantageous circum&s;tances, &s;hall I again a&s;k the mortifying que&s;tion&mdash;What are we doing?&mdash;I avoid the an&s;wer&mdash;I would not offend&mdash;my de&s;ign is only to rou&s;e the &s;ociety from that &s;tate of &s;upinene&s;s and lethargy into which it &s;eems to have fallen, and to &s;timulate its members to a more active attention.</P>
<P>OUR deficiency, I am confident, is not owing to a want of men of &s;trong natural abilities, or a &s;uffi|ciency of acquired learning among&s;t us. Ameri|ca hath been noted for the &s;agacity of her citizens. The very climate is favourable to the production of genius; and the uncultivated abilities of the

lowe&s;t cla&s;s of the natives of this country, &s;eem to be as keen and di&s;cerning as tho&s;e of any country whatever. Our deficiency, then, mu&s;t be owing merely to a want of attention, which, in our &s;itua|tion, is unpardonable.</P>
<P>BUT, as I have pre&s;umed to point at the evil, it is but a rea&s;onable expectation that I &s;hould al&s;o attempt to &s;ugge&s;t a remedy. This I will readily do according to my ideas of what may be benefi|cial to the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, I think it requi&s;ite that this corporation &s;hould have a building of its own, pro|perly con&s;tructed for the accommodation of our library, natural curio&s;ities, and philo&s;ophical appa|ratus, with a convenient hall for the meetings of the &s;ociety, public orations, lectures, &amp;c. To this building there &s;hould be annexed an ob&s;ervatory, a &s;mall chymical laboratory, and a botanical gar|den. To accompli&s;h &s;o great a de&s;ign, the &s;ituation of our trea&s;ury is certainly far inadequate. A mo|derate revenue would &s;erve all the purpo&s;es of the in&s;titution, if we were once provided with a build|ing and apparatus; to effect which, I know of no way, but that of a general &s;ub&s;cription, and an ap|plication to the legi&s;lature for &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This once accompli&s;hed, our annual income might be

augmented, by obliging every new member (ho|norary members in di&s;tant countries excepted) to pay <HI>eight dollars</HI> for his certificate, and to &s;ign an obligation to contribute <HI>twenty &s;hillings</HI> per annum, to the &s;upport of the funds;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this time new members paid nothing on their election, and the annual &s;ub&s;cription was only ten &s;hillings from the members, and that far from being punctually paid.</NOTE> and to be prohibited from voting, or being voted for to any office, unle&s;s all arrears be paid up: and if any member &s;hould refu&s;e or neglect to pay his annual &s;ub&s;cription for three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, it &s;hould be deemed a vo|luntary withdrawing him&s;elf from the &s;ociety, un|le&s;s in ca&s;e of ab&s;ence from the country beyond &s;ea, or other manife&s;tly rea&s;onable excu&s;e.</P>
<P>I would propo&s;e, that in the election of coun&s;el|lors, particular re&s;pect &s;hould be had to choo&s;e &s;uch as would probably duly attend the &s;tated meetings of the &s;ociety; and that the coun&s;ellors &s;o cho&s;en, &s;hould under&s;tand, that however other members may be at liberty to attend or not, as inclination or convenience may permit, it will be expected of them, that <HI>they</HI> &s;hall regularly a&s;&s;emble at the &s;tated times for promoting the purpo&s;es of the in&s;titution; and, therefore, they &s;hall be noticed by written or printed tickets, at lea&s;t twelve hours before the time of meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="024407_0375_0FC70423074AE5C8">THIS particular notice, however, &s;hould not imply the exclu&s;ion of any other member or mem|bers, &s;ummoned only by public adverti&s;ement, who may choo&s;e to attend.</P>
<P>THE coun&s;ellors, be&s;ides the &s;tated meetings, may hold meetings on their own adjournments, or may call them&s;elves together, whenever it &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary; but &s;hall do nothing deci&s;ive concerning the &s;ociety, in their own adjourned meetings, but only dige&s;t and plan mere matters of bu&s;ine&s;s, to be recommended and determined upon at the next &s;tated meeting of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>MY object herein is, that all matters of bu&s;ine&s;s, being duly con&s;idered and prepared, the attention of the &s;ociety may not be too much engaged in matters of little importance to philo&s;ophy; &s;o that the conver&s;ations at the &s;tated meetings, may be mo&s;tly employed in philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects with as little interruption as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT above all, and as a principal object, I would recommend that at every &s;tated meeting of the &s;ociety, or at lea&s;t as often as may be convenient, one or more philo&s;ophical experiments &s;hould ac|tually be exhibited. The particular experiment to be determined upon at the preceding meeting, in

<P>SUCH are the outlines of a reform, which I think would remedy the evils complained of&mdash;and for the following rea&s;ons:&mdash;fir&s;t, as to the neglect in attending the meetings of the &s;ociety. The exhibition of curious, and &s;ometimes new experi|ments, with the conver&s;ations and rea&s;onings which &s;uch experiments would naturally occa&s;ion, mu&s;t, I think, unavoidably engage the attention of many who now ab&s;ent them&s;elves for want of induce|ments of entertainment or in&s;truction. Secondly, the &s;carcity of philo&s;ophical communications: this would al&s;o probably be remedied, as the &s;eeing experiments performed, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing conve|nient opportunities of bringing conceived truths to the te&s;t of fact, would incite and produce e&s;&s;ays on many u&s;eful and curious points, which now live only in idea, and die in neglect. And, thirdly,
<PB N="371" REF="024407_0377_0FC704318E49C2B8">
our book of minutes would &s;hew that they record the proceedings of a philo&s;ophical &s;ociety.</P>
<P>TO conclude, I wi&s;h this addre&s;s may be con&s;i|dered as preparatory to a motion I &s;hall now make &mdash;which is&mdash;</P>
<P>"THAT a committee may be appointed to take into con&s;ideration the con&s;titution, laws, and regu|lations of the &s;ociety; and to propo&s;e &s;uch alte|rations, amendments, and additions thereto, as they may think mo&s;t likely to advance this &s;ociety, and promote the good purpo&s;es for which it was in&s;ti|tuted: and that the &s;aid committee propo&s;e the mo&s;t promi&s;ing means by which a building, and a complete philo&s;ophical apparatus, may be procu|red; and report at the next meeting, or as &s;oon as may be convenient."</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF A <HI>WORM</HI> IN A <HI>HORSE'S EYE.</HI> (Read in the Philo&s;ophical Society,
<DATE>Sept. 26, 1783.</DATE>)</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been my&s;elf a witne&s;s to the follow|ing curious fact, I thought it &s;hould not pa&s;s un|recorded, e&s;pecially as it occured in this city, un|der the immediate notice of the philo&s;ophical &s;ociety.</P>
<P>A report prevailed la&s;t &s;ummer, that a hor&s;e was to be &s;een, which had a living &s;erpent in one of his eyes. At fir&s;t I di&s;regarded this report; but &s;everal of my acquaintance, who had been to &s;ee the hor&s;e, confirming the account, I had the curi|o&s;ity to go my&s;elf, taking a friend along with me.</P>
<P>THE hor&s;e was kept in Arch-&s;treet, and belonged to a free negro. I examined the eye with all the attention in my power, being no ways di&s;po&s;ed to credit the common report, but rather expecting
<PB N="373" REF="024407_0379_0FC70438ABE41968">
to detect a fraud or vulgar prejudice; but was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a real living worm within the ball of the hor&s;e's eye. This worm was of a clear white colour, in &s;ize and appearance much like a piece of white bobbin; it &s;eemed to be from 2 &frac12; to 3 inches in length, which, however, could not be exactly a&s;certained, its whole length never appearing at one time, but only &s;uch a portion thereof as could be &s;een through the iris, which was greatly dilated. The creature was in a con|&s;tant, lively, vermicular motion, &s;ometimes retiring &s;o deep in the eye as not to be &s;een at all, and at other times approaching &s;o near to the iris as to become plainly and di&s;tinctly &s;een; at lea&s;t &s;o much of it as was within the field of the iris. I could not di&s;tingui&s;h its head, neither end being perfectly exhibited whil&s;t I viewed it; and, indeed, its motion was &s;o bri&s;k and con&s;tant as not to ad|mit of &s;o nice an examination.</P>
<P>THE hor&s;e's eye was exceedingly inflamed, &s;woln, and running; I mean the mu&s;cles contigu|ous to the eye-ball, and he &s;eemed to be in great pain; &s;o that it was with difficulty the eye could be kept open for more than a few &s;econds at a time: and I was obliged to watch favourable mo|ments for a di&s;tinct view of this tormentor.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="024407_0380_0FC7043A3948DB20">I believe the hor&s;e was quite blind in that eye, for it appeared as if all the humours were con|founded together, and that the worm had the whole orb to range in; which, however, was not of a diameter &s;ufficient for the worm to extend to its full length, as far as I could di&s;cover. The humours of the eye were beginning to grow opake, like a chilled jelly, and &s;oon afterwards became al|together &s;o, as I was informed.</P>
<P>AS this is an uncommon circum&s;tance, and may affect &s;ome philo&s;ophical doctrines, it is much to be lamented, that the hor&s;e had not been purcha&s;ed, and the eye di&s;&s;ected for better examination.</P>
<P>THAT there was a living, &s;elf-moving worm in the ball of this hor&s;e's eye, free from all deception or mi&s;take, I am mo&s;t confident. How this worm got there, or (if bred in &s;o remarkable a place) where its parents came from, or how they con|trived to depo&s;it their &s;emen, or convey their egg into the eye of an hor&s;e, I leave for others to determine.</P>

Agreeably to my expectation, I ob&s;erved the threads were magnified to the &s;ize of coar&s;e wires; but was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that although I moved the handkerchief to the right and left before my eyes, the dark bars did not &s;eem to move at all; but remained permanent

<HEAD>MR. <HI>RITTENHOUSE</HI>'S ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE experiment you mention with a &s;ilk hand|kerchief, and the di&s;tant flame of a lamp, is much more curious than one would at fir&s;t imagine. For the object we &s;ee is not the web of the handker|chief magnified, but &s;omething very different, as appears from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. A di&s;tinct image of any object placed clo&s;e to the eye, cannot be formed by parallel rays or &s;uch as i&s;&s;ue from a di&s;tant luminous point; for all &s;uch rays pa&s;&s;ing through the pupil, will be col|lected at the bottom of the eye, and there form an image of the luminous point. The threads of the handkerchief would only intercept part of the rays, and render the image le&s;s brilliant.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. If the cro&s;s bars we &s;ee were images of the &s;ilk threads, they mu&s;t pa&s;s over the retina, whil&s;t the threads are made to pa&s;s over the pupil;
<PB N="378" REF="024407_0384_0FC704465FB96DF0">
but this, as you ob&s;erve, does not happen for they continue &s;tationary.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. IF the image on the retina was a picture of the object before the eye, it mu&s;t be fine or coar&s;e according to the texture of the handker|chief. But it does not change with changing the &s;ilk, nor does it change on removing it farther from the eye. And the number of the apparent threads remains the &s;ame, whether ten, twenty, or thirty of the &s;ilk threads pa&s;s acro&s;s the pupil at the &s;ame time. The image we &s;ee mu&s;t, therefore, be formed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> this can be no other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of light in pa&s;&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;urfaces of bodies as de&s;cribed by <HI>Newton.</HI></P>
<P>IT is well known in optics, that different images, of the different points of objects without the eye, are formed on the retina by pencils of rays, which before they fall on the eye are inclined to each other in &s;en&s;ible angles: and the great u&s;e of tele&s;copes is to encrea&s;e the&s;e angles regularly, in a certain ratio, &s;uffering &s;uch rays as were pa|rallel before they enter the tele&s;cope to proceed on parallel after pa&s;&s;ing through it. The ex|tended image which we &s;ee in this experiment mu&s;t therefore be formed by pencils of rays, which be|fore
<PB N="379" REF="024407_0385_0FC7044F390AC498">
they entered the eye, had very con&s;iderable degrees of inclination with re&s;pect to each other. But coming from a &s;mall di&s;tant flame of a lamp, they were nearly parallel before they pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ilk handkerchief. It was therefore the threads of &s;ilk which gave them &s;uch different directions.</P>
<P>BEFORE the &s;ilk is placed to the eye, parallel rays of light will form a &s;ingle lucid &s;pot as at A
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
in the figure, and this &s;pot will &s;till be formed af|terwards by &s;uch rays as pa&s;s through the little me&s;hes uninfluenced by the threads. But &s;uppo&s;e the perpendicular threads by their action on the rays to bend a part of them one degree to the right and left, another part two degrees; there will now be four images formed, two on each &s;ide of the origi|nal one at A. By a &s;imilar action of the horizontal threads, this line of five lucid &s;pots will be divid|ed
<PB N="380" REF="024407_0386_0FC704510EDCF650">
into five other lines, two above and two be|low, making a &s;quare of 25 bright &s;pots, &s;epara|ted by four perpendicular dark lines and four horizontal ones; and the&s;e lucid &s;pots and dark lines will not change their places on moving the web of &s;ilk over the eye, parallel to any of its threads. For the point of the retina on which the image &s;hall fall, is determined by the incidence of the rays with re&s;pect to the axis of the eye, and not by the part of the pupil through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>IN order to make my experiments with more accuracy, I made a &s;quare of parallel hairs about half an inch each way; and to have them near|ly parallel and equidi&s;tant, I got a watch maker to cut a very fine &s;crew on two peices of &s;mall bra&s;s wire. In the threads of the&s;e &s;crews, 106 of which made one inch, the hairs were laid, 50 or 60 in num|ber. Looking thro' the&s;e hairs at a &s;mall opening in the window &s;hutter of a dark room, 1-30^t^h of an inch wide and three inches long, holding the hairs parallel to the &s;lit, and looking towards the &s;ky, I &s;aw three parallel lines, almo&s;t equal in brightne&s;s, and on each &s;ide, four or five much fainter, and growing more faint coloured and in|di&s;tinct the further they were from the middle line,
<PB N="381" REF="024407_0387_0FC70452583E5450">
which I knew to be formed of &s;uch rays as pa&s;s between the hairs, uninfluenced by them.</P>
<P>THINKING my apparatus not &s;o perfect as it might be, I took out the hairs, and put in others, &s;omething thicker; of the&s;e 190 made one inch, and therefore the &s;paces between them were a|bout the 1-250^t^h part of an inch. The three mid|dle lines of light were now not &s;o bright as they had been before, and the others were &s;tronger and more di&s;tinct; and I could count &s;ix on each &s;ide of the middle line &s;eeming to be equally di|&s;tant from each other, e&s;timating the di&s;tance from the centre of one to the centre of the next. The middle line was &s;till well defined and colourle&s;s, the next two were likewi&s;e pretty well defined, but &s;omething broader, having their inner edges tinged with blue, and their outer edges with red: the others were more indi&s;tinct, and con&s;i&s;ted each of the pri&s;matic colours, in the &s;ame order, which, by &s;preading more and more, &s;eemed to touch each other at the fifth or &s;ixth line, but tho&s;e near|e&s;t the middle were &s;eparated from each other by very dark lines, much broader than the bright lines.</P>
<P>FINDING the beam of light which came through the window-&s;hutter divided into &s;o many di&s;tinct

pencils, I was de&s;irous of knowing the angles which they made with each other. For this pur|po&s;e I made u&s;e of a &s;mall pri&s;matic tele&s;cope and micrometer, with which I was favoured by <HI>Dr Franklin.</HI> I fa&s;tened the frame of parallel hairs before the object gla&s;s, &s;o as to cover its aperture entirely: then looking through the tele&s;cope, I mea&s;ured the &s;pace between the two fir&s;t &s;ide lines, and found the angular di&s;tance between their inner edges to be 13&prime; 15&Prime;; from the middle of one to the middle of the other 15&prime; 30&Prime;; and from the outer edge of one to the outer edge of the other 17&prime; 45&Prime;. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, I had a fine blue &s;treak in the middle of the object, and in the la&s;t a red &s;treak. The other lines were too faint, when &s;een through the tele&s;cope to mea&s;ure the angles they &s;ubtended with accuracy; but from &s;uch trials as I made, I am &s;atisfied, that from the &s;econd line on one &s;ide, to the &s;econd on the other &s;ide, and &s;o on, they were double, triple&punc; quadruple, &amp;c. of the fir&s;t angles.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that a very con&s;iderable portion of the beam of light pa&s;&s;ed between the hairs with|out being at all bent out of its cour&s;e; that ano|ther &s;maller portion was bent, at a medium, about 7&prime; 45&Prime; each way; the red rays a little more, and the blue rays a little le&s;s; another &s;till &s;maller por|tion
<PB N="383" REF="024407_0389_0FC7045B81F18730">
15&prime; 30&Prime;; another 23&prime; 15&Prime;, and &s;o on. But that no light, or next to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one, was bent in any an|gle le&s;s than 6&prime;, nor any light of any particular colour in any intermediate angle between tho&s;e which ari&s;e from doubling, tripling, &amp;c. of the angle in which it is bent in the fir&s;t &s;ide lines.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the red rays are more bent out of their fir&s;t direction, and the blue rays le&s;s, as if the hairs acted with more force on the red than on the blue rays; contrary to what happens by refraction, when light pa&s;&s;es obliquely through the common &s;urface of two different mediums. It is, however, con&s;onant to what &s;ir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> ob&s;erves with re&s;pect to the fringes that border the &s;hadows of hairs and other bodies; his words are&mdash;<Q>And, therefore, the hair, in cau&s;ing the&s;e fringes, acted alike upon the red light, or lea&s;t refrangible rays, at a greater di&s;tance, and upon the violet or mo&s;t refrangible rays, at a le&s;s di&s;|tance; and by tho&s;e actions di&s;po&s;ed the red light into larger fringes, and the violet into &s;mal|ler fringes.</Q></P>
<P>BY pur&s;uing the&s;e experiments, it is probable that new and intere&s;ting di&s;coveries may be made re&s;pecting the properties of this wonderful &s;ub|&s;tance, <HI>light,</HI> which animates all nature in the eyes

<HEAD>ORATIONS, WRITTEN FOR, AND AT THE REQUEST OF YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF THE UNIVERSITY, AND DELIVERED BY THEM AT PUBLIC COMMENCEMENTS IN THE COLLEGE HALL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING gone through the u&s;ual cour&s;e of education in this &s;eminary of learning; having pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal trials of private and public exami|nations, I am now in full expectation of receiving tho&s;e parchment honours, which are to te&s;tify the &s;ucce&s;s of my &s;tudies, and prove, to a believing world, that my labour hath not been in vain.</P>
<P>BUT it has been in&s;inuated to me, that before my temples can be crowned with collegiate laurels,
<PB N="2" REF="024407_0395_0FC700466A996D10">
it is expected that I &s;hould addre&s;s you, ladies and gentlemen, in an elegant &s;peech on this grand occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>UNREASONABLE as this demand &s;eemed to be, neverthele&s;s, being long accu&s;tomed to &s;ubmit, I earne&s;tly endeavoured to comply with it. I had re|cour&s;e to books, to &s;olitary walks, ardent invocati|ons, and all the u&s;ual provocatives to good writing. I cho&s;e for my &s;ubject the dignity of the &s;ciences, and the excellent mode of attaining them in this uni|ver&s;ity. I began with a warm apo&s;trophe to this build|ing, in manner and form following:&mdash;Oh, ye &s;acred walls! ye venerable &s;tools and benches! and thou, expanded arch! that ha&s;t &s;o often echoed back the &s;weet effu&s;ions of tho&s;e a&s;piring youths who have, in times pa&s;t, been nurtured within your hallowed precincts&mdash;hear! oh hear! one of your late&s;t &s;ons te&s;tify the ardour with which he feels him&s;elf in|&s;pired!&mdash;Thus far, all was well&mdash;but what to &s;ay next was the difficulty. Whil&s;t I was making eve|ry po&s;&s;ible effort to proceed, an unlucky line of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed poet, who was compo&s;ing new-year's ver&s;es, popped into my head, viz.
<Q>What can I &s;ay, that ha'nt been &s;aid before?</Q></P>
<P>THIS ridiculous que&s;tion quenched all my en|thu&s;ia&s;m in a moment&mdash;like a &s;park drawn from the
<PB N="3" REF="024407_0396_0FC700481841CEF0">
prime conductor, the electrometer fell in&s;tantly, and I gave up the point.</P>
<P>NOTHING could be more unfortunate: I cer|tainly propo&s;ed, ladies and gentlemen, to have made you a very fine &s;peech, in the cu&s;tomary &s;tyle, but my good intention having been thus unhappily fru&s;trated, I mu&s;t e'en depend upon the chance of the moment for what I &s;hall &s;ay; and I doubt not, but that you, my benevolent hearers, will at lea&s;t wi&s;h me good luck, and a happy e&s;cape from my my pre&s;ent difficulty.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH I am under a nece&s;&s;ity to change the intended &s;tile of my &s;peech, I &s;hall not entirely abandon the &s;ubject I had cho&s;en; but &s;hall en|deavour to give this polite audience &s;ome juvenile &s;trictures on the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of what is called a learned education: in doing which, I hope I may be allowed the privilege of &s;peaking freely without giving offence. Although I &s;hall never think my|&s;elf di&s;charged from the obligations I owe to the&s;e my kind and reverend in&s;tructors, for their care and attention to me; yet, being now emancipated from their immediate control, I &s;hall take the li|berty of giving a free &s;cope to my &s;entiments, with|out regarding how far they may run foul of the &s;tated opinions and prejudices of the &s;chools.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="024407_0397_0FC7004CF4C18228">TO begin, then, the detail of our in&s;truction.&mdash; After the young&s;ter hath been taught to &s;pell, read, and write, in his mother tongue, he a&s;cends the fir&s;t &s;tep of learned education.&mdash;The <HI>Latin lan|guage</HI> is the object, to attain which, a Latin gram|mar is put into the poor boy's hands. This gram|mar is called the rudiments or foundation of that language: by which one might &s;uppo&s;e, that the grammar had been given by in&s;piration, and the Romans derived their language from it. But the fact is ju&s;t the rever&s;e; for in every language, the grammar is, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, the re&s;ult, and not the origin of that language: but notwith|&s;tanding this undeniable truth, the Latin mu&s;t be inculcated according to the method and di&s;cipline of the &s;chools, <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> in more &s;en&s;es than one.&mdash;Well! through this grammar, at all events, the bewildered pupil mu&s;t wade, groping for a year or two in utter darkne&s;s, and learning by rote a complicated &s;y&s;tem of rules, the propriety or ap|plication of which it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;ee in any in&s;tance.</P>
<P>THESE rules are framed partly in elegant pro&s;e, and partly in much more elegant ver&s;e, in order, I &s;uppo&s;e, to in&s;inuate to the &s;tudent &s;ome ta&s;te for Latin poetry, whil&s;t he is learning the rudiments of the language. If I had not, ladies, a re|&s;pectful
<PB N="5" REF="024407_0398_0FC70050F44BDCF8">
regard for your ears, and no &s;mall ten|derne&s;s for my own teeth, I would give you a &s;am|ple of our grammar ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e rules have been got by rote, as I &s;aid before, it may be thought that there is no|thing more nece&s;&s;ary to the knowledge of the La|tin tongue&mdash;But Alas! this is only the beginning of troubles&mdash;The rules mu&s;t not only be got by memory, but the exceptions al&s;o to tho&s;e rules&mdash;Now, good people, you mu&s;t know that the&s;e exceptions, are &s;o very numerous, that, in many ca&s;es, it is immaterial which you choo&s;e for a &s;tandard, the rule it&s;elf, or the exception.</P>
<P>THE excellency of this method of teaching a language by means of its grammar, may be illu&s;tra|ted by a familiar parallel. You mu&s;t know, ladies, that when a man &s;tands, or walks, or performs any motions of the body, &s;uch po&s;itions and motions are all reducible to mathematical principles. In all ca&s;es, it is nece&s;&s;ary that what is called the cen|tre of gravity &s;hould be &s;upported, were it other|mi&s;e, the per&s;on mu&s;t unavoidably fall to the ground: and thus are all our movements redu|cible to &s;y&s;tem. Now, if the pre&s;ent mode of education is right, and who dares a&s;&s;ert it is not, you &s;hould not &s;uffer your children to walk,
<PB N="6" REF="024407_0399_0FC70055F5257800">
or even attempt to walk, before they have learned the&s;e rules, for which purpo&s;e you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily provide mathematical nur&s;es and geometrical danc|ing ma&s;ters. Oh the excellence of learning! What delight mu&s;t it afford the fond parent, to &s;ee young ma&s;ter &s;tanding like the rafters of a hou&s;e, and mi&s;s dancing in triangles, rhomboides, and trapeziums.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed. We will &s;uppo&s;e the young &s;tudent hath made &s;ome advances in the know|ledge of the Latin language, according to the me|thod propo&s;ed. The fir&s;t ob&s;ervable con&s;equence is, that he lo&s;es, or at lea&s;t gains, no ground in a ta&s;te for the elegancies of his native tongue. His diction becomes &s;tiff and awkward, and his hand writing intolerable. So that whil&s;t he is &s;tudying the anatomy of a dead language, he re|mains a &s;tranger to the beauties of the living.</P>
<P>IT is probable that there are many among&s;t the ladies, whom I have now the honour to addre&s;s, who have never &s;tudied grammar, or know any thing of its rules; and yet I venture to affirm, that a few lines, written by your fair hands, and dictated by gentle nature, &s;hall convey more lively &s;en&s;ibilities, and &s;hall find a &s;horter way to the heart, than a whole page&mdash;aye, or forty of them &mdash;compo&s;ed by the mo&s;t learned grammarian, with
<PB N="7" REF="024407_0400_0FC7005928526340">
<HI>Dilworth</HI> on his right hand, and <HI>Entick</HI> on his left.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the a&s;&s;iduous youth reads <HI>Ovid's Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> for the improvement of his morals; and learns from <HI>Horace,</HI> to be cha&s;te and temperate. <HI>That</HI> time which might u&s;efully be employed in &s;tudying the hi&s;tories of tho&s;e nati|ons with whom we are, or may be connected, is con&s;umed in reading the delectable and lamentable &s;tory of <HI>Aeneas</HI> and queen <HI>Dido.</HI> The one, a hero of &s;o in&s;ignificant a ca&s;t, that all the laudable ingredients of his character may be compri&s;ed in the words <HI>Pius Aeneas;</HI> and the other, to &s;peak delicately, not the mo&s;t &s;hining example of female virtue and moderation. The one, a di&s;courteous knight, and the other a furious enamorata.</P>
<P>IT ju&s;t occurs to me, that Dido's greate&s;t misfor|tune was, that &s;he lived in a barbarous age, when lawyers were not to be had for love or money. Had her famous amour happened in our day, &s;he might have recovered at lea&s;t &pound;. 750 damages;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This alludes to a circum&s;tance of the time &s;omething like the ca&s;e of queen <HI>Dido.</HI></NOTE> which, all things con&s;idered, would have been
<PB N="8" REF="024407_0401_0FC7005D36BEF038">
much better than cutting her throat upon a wood|pile&mdash;As de&s;perate Dido did&mdash;This by the bye.</P>
<P>THE young &s;tudent is at length fitted for the higher cla&s;&s;es of &s;cience. He learns mathematicks, geography, natural philo&s;ophy, logic, ethics, and metaphy&s;ics.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the three fir&s;t, I would only &s;ay&mdash;That if they were dive&s;ted of &s;ome &s;cientific pedantry (I mean as they are taught in the &s;chools), they are worthy the attention of a ratio|nal mind, ina&s;much as they advance the know|ledge of truth; for of all valuable things, <HI>truth</HI> is the mo&s;t valuable.</P>
<P>BUT of all the &s;y&s;tems of complicated non&s;en&s;e, that ever puzzled the bu&s;y brains of mortal man, <HI>logic</HI> is &s;urely the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant. An art which no ingenuity can apply to any one u&s;eful purpo&s;e of life. Imagine to your&s;elves, gentle hearers, a &s;ociety of <HI>logicians,</HI> who&s;e conver&s;ation in the common occurrences of life &s;hould be conducted in <HI>&s;yllogi&s;tic</HI> mode and form. The learned hou&s;e|keeper goes to market, and endeavours to per|&s;uade the butcher to lower the price of his mut|ton in <HI>celarent;</HI> the butcher enforces his demand in <HI>barbara.</HI> The logical lover al&s;o attacks his dulcinea in form. He a&s;&s;ures her, in <HI>particular af|firmatives,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="024407_0402_0FC70062D48098A0">
that he is enamoured of her charms; and from the&s;e premi&s;es, draws an artful conclu&s;ion, that &s;he ought to encourage his pa&s;&s;ion, and return his love. The lady replies, in <HI>univer&s;al negatives.</HI> The gallant then plays off his whole battery in a compacted <HI>&s;orites.</HI> The lady an&s;wers only in the <HI>&s;imple form</HI>&mdash;a weakne&s;s is di&s;covered in her <HI>mid|dle term</HI>&mdash;&s;he is reduced to a <HI>dilemma,</HI> and &s;urren|ders at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a proce&s;s, what is to become of Cupid and his darts! What is to become of the logic of the eyes, and a thou&s;and namele&s;s expre&s;&s;ions of the feelings of the heart, which nature alone can dictate? What is to become of them! Why they are entirely out of the que&s;tion. Syllogi&s;ms&mdash;in|vincible &s;yllogi&s;ms, mu&s;t &s;upply their place. What is learning good for, unle&s;s it makes us wi&s;er than nature?</P>
<P>BUT I may be told that logic never was de|&s;igned for &s;uch purpo&s;es; and that its u&s;e is the di&s;covery of truth, and the detection of error&mdash; Here I join i&s;&s;ue&mdash;and am bold to a&s;&s;ert, that from the days of Ari&s;totle to the pre&s;ent moment, man|kind are not indebted to <HI>logic</HI> for the di&s;covery of any one u&s;eful truth, or the detection of any one dangerous error&mdash;and further&mdash;that no man ever was <HI>convinced</HI> by a &s;yllogi&s;m&mdash;But I ob&s;erve
<PB N="10" REF="024407_0403_0FC700658CD1D470">
their reverences begin to frown&mdash;I &s;hall, therefore, not urge this &s;ubject any further.</P>
<P><HI>ETHICS</HI> and <HI>metaphy&s;ics</HI> bring up the rear of a learned education. It would tire your patience, my indulgent hearers, &s;hould I enter upon a detail of all the whim&s;ical ab&s;urdities with which the&s;e &s;ciences abound. If a man &s;hould conduct him|&s;elf through life, according to the &s;trict rules of <HI>ethics,</HI> he would be ju&s;t as ridiculous as the knight of <HI>La Mancha,</HI> governing him&s;elf in the mo&s;t com|mon occurrences by the &s;olemn formalities of chivalry.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>metaphy&s;ics,</HI> it is a vi&s;ionary &s;y&s;tem, where|in uncertain conclu&s;ions are drawn from uncertain premi&s;es, and in which the very terms u&s;ed have no determinate meaning. The whole is an inge|nious fabric built in air; having no real, known foundation, whereon to re&s;t: not unlike the Pa|gan creed, that the world &s;tands upon the horns of a bull; the bull on the back of an elephant; the elephant on a great tortoi&s;e; and the great tor|toi&s;e upon nothing.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be owned, however, that we are in|debted to metaphy&s;ics for &s;ome very curious and entertaining riddles: &s;uch as&mdash;that <HI>infinite</HI> carried <PB N="11" REF="024407_0404_0FC70066AC007720">
beyond <HI>infinity</HI> becomes <HI>finite</HI>&mdash;that one <HI>infinity</HI>
may be twice as long as another <HI>infinity</HI>&mdash;that <HI>&s;oul</HI>

put to the laborious ta&s;k of framing laws for our own government, a ta&s;k which we &s;eem but in|differently qualified to perform; we &s;hould have been rid of the intolerable plague, the heart-burn|ings, feuds, cabals, and chicaneries attending popu|lar elections, and we &s;hould have been ea&s;ed of the enormous expence of a&s;&s;emblymen's wages, com|mi&s;&s;ions, fees and &s;alaries to the officers of govern|ment, and a thou&s;and other charges and inconve|niences to which we mu&s;t now be &s;ubjected: we &s;hould have had nothing more to do, but to pay when called upon, and obey when commanded. This further con&s;ideration ought al&s;o to have &s;ome weight, that if we had been cruelly and unju&s;tly oppre&s;&s;ed by a people three thou&s;and miles off, all the world would have pitied our &s;ituation, which is no &s;mall con&s;olation in trouble, and exclaimed again&s;t the tyranny of our oppre&s;&s;ors: whereas, &s;hould things go wrong now, we &s;hall have none to blame but our&s;elves&punc; and when we complain, the natural an&s;wer will be, if you have placed men in power who abu&s;e their tru&s;t, it is your own fault:&mdash;why did you not make a better choice?

payment of no taxes, but &s;uch as are levied by our own con&s;ent, form a pretty arrangement of words and ideas; but, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the fact is &s;eldom really &s;o. No man pays a tax with his own con|&s;ent, that is, he would rather not pay it, if he could refu&s;e with honour and &s;afety. The payment of taxes is always attended with &s;ome reluctance of mind, and often with open murmurings and com|plaints, either as to the time, purpo&s;e, or propor|tion of the tax. The ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e when money is taken from us by the &s;trong hand of ar|bitrary power: all rea&s;oning, all deliberation is out of the que&s;tion&mdash;we have nothing to do but pay&mdash;and &s;o the mind is &s;aved a deal of trouble and vexation.

his ca&s;h, with what chearfulne&s;s, with what expedition will he produce his pur&s;e? and think him&s;elf happy in coming off &s;o well.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to life's not being &s;ecure under a de&s;potic government, I have only to ob&s;erve, that no one can ju&s;tly complain of an injury he ne|ver &s;uffered; and that after the evil hath hap|pened, the party will not be in a condition to complain. So much for civil liberty.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>independence,</HI> cries the American; What have you to &s;ay again&s;t <HI>independence</HI>? The glory of our country, the reward of our va|lour, and the fruit of our &s;even years &s;ufferings, and bloody conte&s;t. This is mere popular excla|mation. Let us view the thing in its true light, and we &s;hall find that all the di&s;advantages atten|ding civil liberty, &s;ome of which I have enume|rated, are applicable to independence, together with many additional con&s;equences.</P>
<P>WHILST we were dependent upon Great Bri|tain, we had no trouble in &s;tudying the characters, cu&s;toms, and manners of foreign nations; the Engli&s;h were &s;o kind as to furni&s;h us with all their ideas on the&s;e &s;ubjects. They told us, that the <HI>French</HI> are a trifling and contemptible nation;
<PB N="21" REF="024407_0414_0FC7009260223A10">
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are proud, &s;ullen, and re|vengeful; the <HI>Germans,</HI> o&s;tentatious; the <HI>Ho|landers,</HI> boors; the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> &s;avages; and, in &s;hort, that the Engli&s;h were them&s;elves the only people fit to live and govern the word, as if all other nations held their dominions by u&s;urpation. How ea&s;y was it to believe all this? Implicit faith &s;aves an infinity of trouble. How happy were we in &s;ubmitting to the government, adopting the prejudices, and aping the manners of a nation, which we conceived to be the glory of the world, and the perfection of human nature?</P>
<P>WHEREAS, now, we are under the painful ne|ce&s;&s;ity of altering our &s;entiments. We are compel|led by actual experience to acknowledge, that the <HI>French</HI> are a brave, generous, and poli&s;hed peo|ple: and that none of the other nations are, in truth, &s;uch as they have been repre&s;ented to us. Our commercial connections will convince us that human nature is fundamentally the &s;ame in every country. That good and bad men are to be found in every climate; and that the people of England have not actually monopolized all the virtue and wi&s;dom of the world. Every convic|tion of error, is a violence done to the mind, in|a&s;much as the forcible eradication of a preju|dice

<P>ANOTHER inconvenience attending our indepen|dence is this&mdash;The impo&s;ts and duties heretofore laid on our commerce, contributed to the revenue of a prince three thou&s;and miles di&s;tant, it was therefore not thought di&s;reputable for the mer|chant to evade the payment of tho&s;e duties, if he could. How delightful was it to exerci&s;e every &s;pecies of ingenuity and craft in bilking collectors and cu&s;tomhou&s;e officers! And how &s;weet was the enjoyment of the profits &s;o obtained! But our independence has deprived us of all the&s;e commercial advantages; as it would be di&s;honour|ble, and even wicked, to evade the duties laid by our own laws, and for the &s;upport of our own go|vernment.</P>

<HEAD>&rindx; AT a public commencement in the univer&s;ity, an argument was held for and again&s;t the practice of DUELLING; the following &s;peech was written for the young gentleman who took the defen&s;ive &s;ide.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash; I Marvel my fellow-&s;tudent did not a&s;cend the pulpit, and deliver his pious harangue from thence. You have been entertained, my worthy hearers, with a &s;ort of chapter again&s;t DUELLING: the orator has entrenched him&s;elf behind certain texts of &s;cripture, and &s;ome vulgar prejudices&mdash; the&s;e make up the &s;um total of his argument; for, as to the re&s;t, it was mere declamation.</P>
<P>YOU may make what u&s;e you plea&s;e of his fine &s;peech; but if you imagine that his private &s;enti|ments coincide with his public declamation, you may find your&s;elves much mi&s;taken.

I an&s;wer from his own words ju&s;t now delivered: "I hope, (&s;aid he) this polite audi|ence will give me a candid hearing upon this &s;ub|ject, and entertain no unfavourable &s;entiments of

my courage, though I &s;hould condemn it"&mdash;mean|ing the practice of duelling. This preparatory <HI>&s;alvo</HI> may be paraphra&s;ed thus: "I am going, good people, to give you a declamation again&s;t the cu&s;tom of fighting duels. This you mu&s;t know is not an undertaking of my own choice, but has been impo&s;ed upon me. I mu&s;t, therefore, make the be&s;t of it I can. But if you, or any of you, &s;hould conclude from what I &s;hall now &s;ay, that I have not courage to defend my in&s;ulted honour, I tell you before hand, you have mi&s;taken your man." This much, indeed, I can an&s;wer for the gentleman&mdash;I have known him &s;ome con&s;iderable length of time, and have not found him more meek and patient than his neighbours: but I leave him to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, and only reque&s;t your kind attention, whil&s;t I offer &s;ome arguments in an&s;wer to his fine &s;peech, and in ju&s;tification of the prac|tice of duelling.</P>
<P>THE gentleman has told us, that duelling derives its origin from the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> and tho&s;e other barbarous nations which over-ran Europe, and extingui&s;hed all the refinements of art, &s;cience, and morality: that the&s;e &s;avages, not having &s;aga|city &s;ufficient to determine in matters of private controver&s;y, referred the di&s;pute to the deci&s;ion of heaven, by bringing the parties to mortal combat,
<PB N="26" REF="024407_0419_0FC700A3626C6C78">
under a belief that God would interfere in favour of right and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING this to have been the real pedigree of duelling, I think it no di&s;honourable one: it was neither irreverend nor irrational to believe in a particular, as well as a general providence, and to &s;ubmit to his unerring judgment and all-&s;eeing eye, the detection of truth, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall delve much deeper for the root of this practice; and am confident in a&s;&s;erting, that it is not founded in the cu&s;toms of any parti|cular age or nation, barbarous or civilized; but is inherent in the nature of man; is part of his ori|ginal con&s;titution, and coeval with his creation.</P>
<P>BEFORE laws were formed for re&s;triction, or re|velation given for in&s;truction, man walked in the paths of natural liberty: he had a right to every thing his &s;trength or wi&s;dom could acquire, and to re&s;ent every injury according to his power and magnanimity. This right was indelibly recorded in the texture of his con&s;titution: his Creator had given him &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, and &s;uch pow|ers of body for the purpo&s;e, as could by no means be mi&s;taken. The ultimate object was the hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="27" REF="024407_0420_0FC700A4E54AC4A8">
of the individual, in its &s;u&s;tenance and &s;ecu|rity: but the race of mankind greatly encrea&s;ing, their intercour&s;es and interferences became more frequent. The weak and timid were not able to &s;tand again&s;t the &s;trong and courageous: they lo&s;t their property, and had not &s;trength to recover it: they received in&s;ults and injuries, and had not &s;pi|rit to re&s;ent. At length they had recour&s;e to cun|ning to obtain that &s;ecurity which they could not accompli&s;h by valour; and formed a device which &s;hould put the weake&s;t upon a footing with the &s;tronge&s;t of their own &s;pecies. This was the ori|gin of civil &s;ociety. A &s;olemn compact was made, wherein every individual, for him&s;elf, and for his po&s;terity, re&s;igned his natural liberty, and natural rights, into the hands of the collective body of the whole.&mdash;And what did the individual receive in return? Why a &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance, that all his inju|ries &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, his property &s;ecured, and his per&s;onal rights and dignities &s;upported and de|fended by <HI>the whole.</HI></P>
<P>IT is on this compact that I ground my argu|ments in defence of duelling. The powers of this <HI>whole,</HI> or of &s;ociety, are exhibited and exerted in the execution of laws. To the laws, therefore, mu&s;t every individual apply for ju&s;tice. And I do not he&s;itate to acknowledge, that in all ca&s;es,
<PB N="28" REF="024407_0421_0FC700AE1CD272D0">
where the laws can give compotent &s;atisfaction, no man ought to attempt the redre&s;s of his own wrongs. But if there &s;hould be ca&s;es wherein a man may &s;uffer the mo&s;t attrocious injuries, and the mo&s;t provoking indignities, for which the laws have made no provi&s;ion at all, or no adequate pro|vi&s;ion, I &s;ay recour&s;e may and ought to be had to original natural rights for redre&s;s; the compact between the <HI>whole</HI> and the individual having been &s;o far violated on the part of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;tance; if my neighbour &s;hould claim a title to my land, it would be very ab&s;urd in me to &s;end him a challenge to determine on titles by &s;word and pi&s;tol. The laws of the country are quite competent to this bu&s;ine&s;s, and by the &s;ocial compact afore&s;aid, I, or my ance&s;tors for me, a|greed to &s;ubmit the determination to them. But if an adver&s;ary, either in my pre&s;ence, or behind my back, &s;hould load me with unmerited abu&s;e, &s;tain my reputation with injurious fal&s;ehoods, and &s;candalize me with the approbrious terms of <HI>rogue, ra&s;cal, &s;coundrel, villain,</HI> &amp;c. how am I to obtain redre&s;s? I appeal to the laws; the learned judge puts on his &s;pectacles, and after turning over his common place book, and referring to many folio authorities, he tells me, with phlegmatic &s;olem|nity, that he can find no &s;uch words there: that

Hath not all the world agreed in the obloquy of the&s;e terms? Do they not imply every thing that is ba&s;e, di&s;ho|nourable, and contemptible? But they are not known in law. Very well; I appeal then to tho&s;e laws which are not too learned to under&s;tand, nor reluctant in recognizing the manife&s;t injury that has been done to me; I appeal to the court of nature, where I am &s;ure my action will lie.

I reproach my adver&s;ary with the unprovoked wrong. I call him forth to defend the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his tongue by the valour of his arm. I generou&s;ly put my&s;elf upon the &s;ame footing with my foe. I expo&s;e my

life in defence of my reputation, which is dearer than life, and depend upon Heaven, and the ju&s;|tice of my cau&s;e, for the important event.</P>
<P>IT is in vain to oppo&s;e a few &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;ons and vulgar prejudices, to a cu&s;tom authori&s;ed by nature, confirmed by the practice of every age and nation, &s;anctified by divine permi&s;&s;ion, and avowedly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the civil law.</P>
<P>IT may be thought that I have ventured too far in the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions; but I have ventured no far|ther than I can well ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>THAT it is authori&s;ed by nature, I have alrea|dy &s;ufficiently &s;hewn. That it hath been the prac|tice of every age and nation, will not be denied. Hi&s;tory abuduantly proves it. That it hath been &s;anctified by divine permi&s;&s;ion, may be &s;hewn in many in&s;tances. Not to be tedious, I &s;hall only refer to the famous duel fought between <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Goliah</HI> in the valley of <HI>Elah.</HI> But that this cu&s;|tom, or at lea&s;t the principle on which it is founded, is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the civil law, requires a little ex|planation.</P>
<P>I a&s;k, then, in what law of nature is the law of nations founded which ju&s;tifies public war?
<PB N="31" REF="024407_0424_0FC700B1B5A35A90">
What &s;ay the books? The mo&s;t approved writers on this &s;ubject? They tell us, that if a di&s;pute happens between two princes, or the nations over which they pre&s;ide, there is no power on earth autho|rized to determine the controver&s;y. There are no degrees in &s;overeignty. Nations are to be con&s;idered as individuals in a &s;tate of nature, and the civil law is nothing more than the laws of na|ture re&s;pecting individuals applied to nations, &s;o far as that can be done with con&s;i&s;tency. There|fore, &s;ay the&s;e authorities, as there is no earth|ly judge impowered to determine a controver|&s;y between nation and nation, the parties mu&s;t, and have a right to, take up arms, and re&s;t their cau&s;e on the bloody arbitrament of war; tru&s;ting that Heaven will favour the right. In fact, the contending nations fight a great and mighty duel. And are not the&s;e the very prin|ciples upon which I have endeavoured to ju&s;tify private duels? If all the powers of earth &s;hould agree to a form a national &s;ociety, and &s;hould re&s;ign their re&s;pective individual &s;overeignties into the hands of <HI>the whole,</HI> and form a &s;y&s;tem of a general law for the adju&s;tment of national controver&s;ies, and the redre&s;s of national wrongs, public war would then become unju&s;tifiable, unle&s;s in ca&s;es where no provi&s;ion had been made by the general &s;y&s;tem: in &s;uch ca&s;es the contending
<PB N="32" REF="024407_0425_0FC700BCA8D45CB0">
powers would certainly go to war, and fight a na|tional duel.</P>
<P>HAVING been thus large in e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;olid foundation whereon to re&s;t my argument, I &s;hall not take up much of your time in what remains. I &s;hall rather &s;ugge&s;t hints than dilate opinions on the u&s;es and benefits which &s;ociety derives from the exi&s;tence of this cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e we need only look into the &s;cenes of polite life, public a&s;&s;emblies, the army, the na|vy, and the courts of princes. If every hot tem|pered, over-bearing, ill-mannered fellow could in|dulge his &s;urly humour, or vent his capricious &s;pleen without apprehending any con&s;equences, but &s;uch as the heavy paced law might bring on, our &s;cenes of plea&s;ure, urbanity, and polite|ne&s;s would become bear-gardens of confu&s;ion, re&s;ounding with noi&s;y broils, and malicious al|tercations. A duel&mdash;the fatal determination of &s;word or pi&s;tol is a very &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s. Even the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and imprudent caveller, will be cautious how he involves him&s;elf in &s;o trouble|&s;ome an affair. And this con&s;ideration keeps many a licentious &s;pirit within the limits of decorum.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="024407_0426_0FC700BE7019C050">A prudent man will take every rea&s;onable, e|very honourable, means to prevent a quarrel from coming to &s;o critical an i&s;&s;ue, and will advance as far towards explanation and reconciliation as may be con&s;i&s;tent with his enjoyment of that reputa|tion and e&s;teem, without which life it&s;elf is of lit|tle value.</P>
<P>I readily acknowledge, that duels &s;ometimes happen upon too trivial occa&s;ions; and that the rational and honourable means of clearing up mi&s;|takes, and reconciling differences, are not always employed as they &s;hould be; but the abu&s;e of any principle or practice &s;hould not be admitted as an argument for its abolition,</P>

<HEAD><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The young lads of the college invited their friends to hear &s;ome public &s;peaking on the 4th of July 1785; this &s;peech was delivered as introductory to the entertainment of the day.</NOTE> ON PUBLIC SPEAKING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have invited you to this place, and you have conde&s;cended to accept of our invitation. It is rather too late now to enquire what our abi|lities can furni&s;h for your entertainment; or, what your expectations ought to be. Here we are, and notwith&s;tanding much &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and flat|tering hope, on the part of my companions, it turns out ju&s;t as I expected; that we mu&s;t depend on your good nature for a favourable reception, and not on the excellence of our performances.</P>
<P>MY own opinion was much oppo&s;ed to the whole &s;cheme, being greatly apprehen&s;ive, that we &s;hould only expo&s;e our&s;elves before &s;o polite and judicious an audience. But no&mdash;it would be <HI>fourth

of July</HI>&mdash;every one had &s;omething clever to &s;ay on the occa&s;ion&mdash;the &s;ubject would recommend it&s;elf &mdash;the ladies would be plea&s;ed&mdash;the gentlemen would have too much complai&s;ance to oppo&s;e their opinions with har&s;h critici&s;ms&mdash;and all would be well:&mdash;I wi&s;h it may be &s;o with all my heart.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this public &s;peaking is but a dull kind of entertainment, e&s;pecially when admini&s;tered by young and unexperienced orators, on &s;ubjects which have been &s;o frequently and ful|ly inve&s;tigated, as to leave &s;carce a flower in the field for us to gather. In this &s;ituation what more can we do than make a very good bow at the be|ginning of our &s;peech, and a much better one at the end of it; and ever this is more than we are all able to perform, as you may have already ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>IT is cu&s;tomary with profe&s;&s;ed and &s;kilful ora|tors to &s;upplicate the candid indulgence of their auditors. This is frequently, with them, only a ceremonious compliment; but with us, you may depend upon it, it is a &s;incere and earne&s;t reque&s;t. For it mu&s;t certainly exerci&s;e the mo&s;t practi&s;ed pa|tience, to &s;ee a lad &s;tand, bolt upright for half an hour, like the definition of a perpendicular line in Euclid, and utter what he calls a <HI>&s;peech;</HI> or to &s;ee ano+ther
<PB N="36" REF="024407_0429_0FC700C99E5C0C88">
bounce about the &s;tage, and vociferate a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> oration; as if eloquence was the produce of agili|ty of body and &s;trength of lungs. The only apo|logy that can be made is, that we do the be&s;t in our power, and are in hopes of performing better hereafter.</P>
<P>TO &s;peak in public with propriety and effect, requires many talents, natural and acquired. The object of all public &s;peaking is <HI>per&s;ua&s;ion:</HI> to make other people believe or act according to the &s;peak|er's mind. For this purpo&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the orator &s;hould have a <HI>plea&s;ing addre&s;s, a lively imagination, a thorough knowledge of his &s;ubject, and a good ear,</HI> with re&s;pect to the language in which he is to deliver his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>FIRST impre&s;&s;ions have an unavoidable influ|ence on the mind. The mo&s;t judicious and im|partial hearers conceive &s;ome predilection for, or prejudice again&s;t, the &s;peaker on his very fir&s;t ap|pearance. It is, therefore, of great importance, that a genteel manner, and graceful addre&s;s, &s;hould be&s;peak the favourable attention of the audience; otherwi&s;e, the orator will not only have to encoun|ter the difficulties incident to his &s;ubject, but mu&s;t al&s;o labour again&s;t a foreign influence: whereas a genteel figure, graceful deportment, and a plea&s;ing
<PB N="37" REF="024407_0430_0FC700CDDF58F6A0">
addre&s;s, &s;ometimes operate in his favour to greater advantage than all the force of his arguments; and what is of infinite importance, he is &s;ure of the good opinion of the ladies.</P>
<P><HI>A lively imagination</HI> will enable the orator to throw an air of novelty over his &s;ubject, and to pre&s;ent it in points of view in which it hath not frequently been con&s;idered. To enforce his argu|ments with apt allu&s;ions, and embelli&s;h the whole with &s;triking metaphors. To hear a dull and hackneyed &s;ubject elaborately di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by a dull and phlegmatic &s;peaker, affords about as much entertainment, as to hear a demon&s;tration from Euclid, proving a propo&s;ition, which cannot be de|nied; or a &s;tring of logical &s;yllogi&s;ms, proving nothing at all.</P>
<P><HI>A thorough knowledge of his &s;ubject,</HI> I have laid down as the next requi&s;ite in a public &s;peaker. This, I confe&s;s, is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; as there are many who make a very tolerable figure without it. It might, indeed, be extremely incon|venient to make this rule &s;trict and general, ina&s;|much as there would be danger of &s;ilencing one third of the gentlemen of the bar; one-half of the orators of the pulpit; and three-fourths of the &s;peakers in parliaments and hou&s;es of a&s;&s;embly:
<PB N="38" REF="024407_0431_0FC700CEE4E140F0">
yet it &s;eems but reasonable, that an author &s;hould have &s;ome knowledge of the &s;ubject he is hand|ling; and, therefore, this rule is rather recom|mended than in&s;i&s;ted upon.</P>
<P><HI>A good ear</HI> is the la&s;t mentioned, though not the lea&s;t important qualification of a good &s;peaker. If his language is pure, his periods harmoniou&s;ly arranged, and his voice melodiou&s;ly adapted to the con&s;truction of every &s;entence, the orator will not fail to charm his hearers, even though there &s;hould be but a very &s;canty portion of &s;olid &s;en&s;e diluted in his flowing rhetoric. The mind is in&s;en&s;ibly captivated by plea&s;ing &s;ounds, and the mo&s;t obdurate judgment yields to the ma|gic influence of &s;weet harmony. It is, therefore, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that authors of little &s;en&s;e &s;hould pay great attention to the powers of &s;ound; for every hearer expects to be either in&s;tructed or plea&s;ed; and he has a right ta expect it.</P>
<P>IT is next to impo&s;&s;ible to lay down rules for harmonious compo&s;ition. When words and &s;en|tences are &s;o arranged, as to produce a plea&s;ing melody, all acknowledge the effect, but none can point out that particular con&s;truction in which the magic con&s;i&s;ts. Grammar rules have nothing to do with it; for a &s;entence may be &s;trictly gram|matical,
<PB N="39" REF="024407_0432_0FC700D0763E5A40">
and yet as offen&s;ive to the ear as the &s;harp|ening of a &s;aw. For in&s;tance, ob&s;erve the contra&s;t between the two following &s;entences; both of which are equally unexceptionable in point of grammar.</P>
<P>"SOME have a happy talent of expre&s;&s;ion, whereby they compen&s;ate the want of &s;entiment, by the melody of their &s;tyle; their language, ever flowing like a wave of the &s;ea, and their periods clo&s;ing in &s;uch mu&s;ical cadence, that the ear is fa&s;cinated by the magic of &s;ound, and the mind lulled in a plea&s;ing repo&s;e."</P>
<P>"OTHERS, without giving to grammar rules offence, &s;hall arrange &s;o un&s;killfully their words, breaking, as it were, and interrupting the &s;en&s;e, or rather non&s;en&s;e, they mean to inculcate, by frequent (and oft-times unnece&s;&s;ary) parenthe&s;is, that the ear &s;tumbles through the rugged para|graph, as the feet would &s;tumble in &s;crambling through a &s;treet, when the pavement had been broken up, over bricks, &s;tones, and po&s;ts, mixed together confu&s;edly."</P>
<P>A fine &s;peech, like a fine lady, enforces atten|tion, and captivates the heart. When it de&s;cribes
<PB N="40" REF="024407_0433_0FC700DB5F9DC000">
plea&s;ing objects, it is beautiful nature, dre&s;&s;ed by the graces; when it &s;oars in the &s;ublime, it ele|vates the &s;oul, and animates the nobler pa&s;&s;ions: it gives to per&s;ua&s;ion irre&s;i&s;tible force, and bids the tear of pity fall, like the dew of heaven&mdash;gently fall&mdash;on virtue in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE LEARNED LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible of the dangers and difficulties to which an orator expo&s;es him&s;elf, who boldly ad|ventures to oppo&s;e public prejudices, and contra|dict e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions, and yet without this li|terary heroi&s;m, philo&s;ophic truth had never been brought to light. A rigid adherence to doctrines generally admitted, would have fixed us at this day in the errors of ancient &s;y&s;tems, or have left us involved in the whim&s;ical vortices of the modern <HI>De&s;cartes.</HI></P>
<P>THE generality of mankind receive for truth, whatever may be handed to them as &s;uch, by tho&s;e whom they have been accu&s;tomed to e&s;teem as men of profound learning. They are not anxious to enquire for them&s;elves; becau&s;e enquiry is re|plete with trouble, and it is much ea&s;ier for them to adopt the opinions of others, than to form opi|nions for them&s;elves. Had a&s;tronomers told the multitude, that the &s;un is twice the di&s;tance, or but
<PB N="42" REF="024407_0435_0FC700DEC0536F60">
half the di&s;tance from the earth, that he is now &s;uppo&s;ed to be, it would have been &s;o believed; not one in a million would have thought of de|tecting the error by calculation. But woe to the man who attempts to unhinge the popular &s;y&s;tem! <HI>Galileo</HI> was impri&s;oned and per&s;ecuted for a&s;&s;erting that the earth revolved on its axis, and was com|pelled publicly to renounce a truth of which he was fully convinced, and of which there is now no doubt remaining.</P>
<P>THESE preparatory ob&s;ervations I thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as an apology for the manner in which I propo&s;e to handle the &s;ubject a&s;&s;igned to me: to wit, <HI>the u&s;e and advantages of what are called the learned languages in the education of youth.</HI></P>
<P>THESE advantages ought, indeed, to be very great and manife&s;t to compen&s;ate for the precious time &s;pent in acquiring them. Let us, for a mo|ment, if po&s;&s;ible, lay a&s;ide former prejudices, and con&s;ider the &s;ubject with candour and im|partiality.</P>
<P>THE benefits to be expected from the &s;tudy of the dead languages, mu&s;t, I think, flow from &s;ome or all of the following &s;ources. It mu&s;t either
<PB N="43" REF="024407_0436_0FC700E7AFA03320">
open a door of knowledge, to which there is no other means of acce&s;s, or will poli&s;h the manners, and enrich the mind with ideas not otherwi&s;e to be acquired; or will &s;erve as a key to all other languages, and become a vehicle of univer&s;al com|munication.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the fir&s;t I venture to a&s;&s;ert, and think it will hardly be controverted, that there is no ancient author, Latin, Greek, or He|brew; philo&s;opher, hi&s;torian, or poet, of any reputation, who&s;e exi&s;ting works have not been tran&s;lated by able hands into mo&s;t of the modern languages of Europe. So that there can be no knowledge contained in tho&s;e works to which the reader of the pre&s;ent day may not have acce&s;s by the ea&s;y medium of his native tongue. The trea|&s;ures of the ancients have been minutelv &s;crutiniz|ed, and every article of value held up to public view, and faithfully reflected from the mirrours of modern languages.</P>
<P>NEITHER can I &s;ee, in the &s;econd place, how an acquaintance with the Latin, Greek, or Hebrew tongues &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily poli&s;h the manners, or enrich the mind with ideas not otherwi&s;e to be ac|quired. Is there an inherent magic, a &s;upernatu|ral fecundity, in tho&s;e ancient languages which
<PB N="44" REF="024407_0437_0FC700E88EBAA910">
modern modes of &s;peech cannot boa&s;t? When a plain man reads in his Bible the&s;e words:
<Q>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God;</Q>
has he not the &s;ame ideas &s;ugge&s;ted, and an equal comprehen&s;ion of their meaning with the learned &s;cholar when he teads in loftier tone, "<GAP DESC="foreign">."&mdash;Surely there can be no difference. As to poli&s;hing the manners, a minute and technical knowledge of the learned languages hath an effect &s;o notoriou&s;ly to the contrary, that to call a man <HI>a mere &s;cholar,</HI> is as much as to &s;ay, he has no manners at all.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps languages, like medals, acquire a value merely from their antiquity. If &s;o, we ought to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;chools for teaching the Chine&s;e tongue, which is certainly more ancient than either Latin or Greek, and, as &s;ome contend, than even the Hebrew it&s;elf. Look where we will for a di&s;|tingui&s;hing pre-eminence in the&s;e dead languages, &s;uch as may ju&s;tify the great expence of time and &s;tudy nece&s;&s;ary to acquire them, and candour mu&s;t acknowledge that &s;uch pre-eminence is not to be found.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays the third po&s;ition, they &s;erve as a key to all modern languages, and may be made a uni|ver&s;al means of communication.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="024407_0438_0FC700E9EE7A1DF8">THE only purpo&s;e of language is to convey ideas. If modern &s;peech does this, it is complete; if it does not, it is no language. What nece&s;&s;ity then for a key? When a per&s;on &s;ays <HI>a hou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>a man,</HI> is he not as well under&s;tood as if he &s;hould add, that the one was called <HI>domus,</HI> and the other <HI>homo,</HI> by the ancient Romans? <HI>Terms</HI> are altoge|ther arbitrary; and general con&s;ent alone adapts them to the things they are de&s;igned to repre&s;ent. And &s;urely the general con&s;ent of the moderns is as re&s;pectable and valid as the general con&s;ent of the ancients. The truth is, there is no natural connection between <HI>words</HI> and <HI>things.</HI></P>
<P>IF &s;uch a connection was to con&s;titute the per|fection of a language, we mu&s;t acknowledge, that the infant excels in propriety when he calls a &s;heep <HI>baa,</HI> or a dog <HI>bow-wow.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Latin tongue, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, may &s;erve as a univer&s;al means of communication between people of different nations. True; and &s;o may any other language, if univer&s;ally admitted and taught. The Latin tongue does not &s;eem to be peculiarly and exclu&s;ively adapted to this purpo&s;e. For, notwith&s;tanding that it has been inculcated with &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity by innumerable private tutors, and public &s;chools, for &s;o many hundred years;
<PB N="46" REF="024407_0439_0FC700F0D76570E0">
yet the French, is at this day, a more univer&s;al language than the Latin. The experiment has been fairly made and urged to the extent; yet but few write in Latin, and fewer &s;till u&s;e it as a me|dium of conver&s;ation. As to Greek, it is no where in fa&s;hion but in the &s;chools; and none but the Jews make u&s;e of the Hebrew. To what purpo&s;e then are &s;o many years &s;pent in acquiring the&s;e ob&s;olete languages? Why, truly, that one in ten thou&s;and may read ancient authors in the ori|ginal, whil&s;t the unhappy ten thou&s;and mu&s;t put up with faithful tran&s;lations.</P>
<P>AN ob&s;ervation or two on the method of teach|ing the&s;e learned languages &s;hall clo&s;e my &s;peech on this occa&s;ion, which I perceive <HI>&s;ome</HI> think is already longer than it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>IT might &s;eem &s;trange to a&s;&s;ert, that few teach|ers of a language, according to the pre&s;ent mode of teaching, have any ta&s;te for its beauties or knowledge of its powers. And yet this is manife&s;tly a general truth; accu&s;tomed, as they are, to treat it by detail, and hackneyed in a critical con&s;idera|tion of its component parts, they, almo&s;t unavoida|bly, lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of its general effect, and become &s;trangers to that &s;pirit of expre&s;&s;ion, in which its principal elegance con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="024407_0440_0FC700F4536E6938">FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on, the pupil never acquires a true ta&s;te for the learned languages, till after he has been emancipated from the &s;hackles of gram|matical inve&s;tigation.</P>

Alas! all would va|ni&s;h in the &s;chola&s;tic proce&s;s.

<P>BUT my zeal for truth is hurrying me beyond the bounds of di&s;cretion; the time may come when teachers will be convinced that languages are not to be &s;quared by rule and compa&s;s, as lands are &s;urveyed; and that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;earch antiquity for the means of a reciprocal com|munication of ideas; and that languages mo&s;t in u&s;e, are, in truth, the mo&s;t u&s;eful to be known.</P>

<HEAD>A REPLY TO THE FOREGOING SPEECH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY fellow &s;tudent has entertained you with a di&s;&s;ertation on the learned languages, and added &s;ome &s;trictures on the method of teaching them in modern &s;chools. He has handled the &s;ubject in his own eccentric way; and has, I doubt not, ob|tained from this polite audience all the credit his ingenuity de&s;erves.</P>
<P>BUT ingenuity is not truth; and fal&s;e rea&s;oning, however varni&s;hed with wit, is fal&s;e rea&s;oning &s;till.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not attempt to imitate my friend in the vivacity of his &s;tile; but he mu&s;t excu&s;e me, if I endeavour to expo&s;e the fallacy of his argu|ments&punc; and re&s;cue &s;o con&s;iderable a branch of mo|dern education from the obloquy his caprici|ous humour hath been plea&s;ed to throw upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="024407_0443_0FC700FE58A96A60">HAVING my&s;elf been duly fermented with gram|matic froth; kneaded and moulded by the di&s;ci|pline of the &s;chools; baked, and as it were, pi|ping hot from the cla&s;&s;ical oven, and incru&s;ted with &s;cience, can I hear the&s;e &s;landers on the learned languages, which I have been &s;o long ac|cu&s;tomed to re&s;pect, and which I have acquired with &s;o much painful &s;tudy, and yet &s;it &s;ilent by? No! the fire of old Rome, and the &s;pirit of Athens, will not brook &s;uch indignity.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, and indeed the ground on which he chiefly re&s;ts, is, that all ancient authors of any repute have been tran&s;lated into the mo|dern languages; from which he infers, that the originals are of no further u&s;e. He might with equal rea&s;on have &s;aid, becau&s;e a &s;hadow pro|jects the true out lines of the &s;ub&s;tance, it is of equal value, and will an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT there are numberle&s;s beauties to be di&s;co|vered by the &s;cholar in the original, and a force and propriety ari&s;ing from what is called the <HI>idiom</HI> of a language which no tran&s;lation can convey: not only this, but the real meaning of the author, even in the original, is not always preci&s;ely a&s;|certained by the learned them&s;elves&mdash;how then &s;hall it be found in a tran&s;lation?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="024407_0444_0FC7010123B76EC0">TO prove this, we need only look at the volu|minous notes upon Horace, or the various rea|dings of Virgil, in which the mo&s;t profound &s;cho|lars have differed in opinion; and about which they have di&s;puted, confuted, and refuted each o|ther time immemorial. What delightful ob&s;curi|ty! What glorious uncertainty! Will a tran&s;lation furni&s;h any thing like this? Surely not. The terms of a known and living language are too well under&s;tood to admit of much altercation. All is a dead or languid preci&s;ion. The &s;y&s;tem, the the doctrines, the arguments of a modern author may be que&s;tioned and canva&s;&s;ed; but &s;eldom his meaning, if he has any meaning at all.</P>
<P>THE great and excellent u&s;e of the learned lan|guages con&s;i&s;ts, in my opinion, in the two follow|ing particulars.</P>
<P>FIRST, They afford the moderns an inexhau&s;ti|ble &s;ource of ingenious altercation and profound conjecture: and,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, By deriving the technical terms of every art and &s;cience from the&s;e languages, a my&s;terious ob&s;curity is obtained which throws a veil over the face of truth, and &s;creens the rays of of knowledge from vulgar eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="024407_0445_0FC701072CF4D9A0">AS to the fir&s;t; in the various readings of ancient authors, in notes, critical and explana|tory, and in notes upon tho&s;e notes, what a field is opened for profound erudition! And when the modern commentator finds him&s;elf hard pu&s;hed, it is but &s;uppo&s;ing an error to have crept into the text; it is but altering a letter or two, as occa&s;ion &s;hall require, and he can make the original &s;upport his comment with all the &s;eem|ing rea&s;on in the world. And however a brother critic may di&s;pute his conjectures, he is &s;ure that the author him&s;elf will never come back to decide the conte&s;t and put him to &s;hame. An ob&s;cene &s;entence will furni&s;h a literary fea&s;t, and one half of a long Greek or He|brew word has been &s;ufficient to occa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on a &s;chi&s;m, and give the world a new religious &s;ect.</P>
<P>I know of no modern author &s;o rich in this kind of learning as <HI>Shake&s;peare.</HI> He wrote on the verge of the old and modern Engli&s;h, and has &s;o blended the idioms of the writers of his day, with tho&s;e of their grandfather's, as to occa&s;ion much delightful uncertainty and ingenious com|mentating. This, together with the incorrect manner in which his works have been handed to us, have afforded a glorious opportunity for gue&s;s-work: and <HI>Pope, Warburton, Theobald, John&s;on,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="024407_0446_0FC70108BB07C548">
and many others have exerci&s;ed their talents ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>BUT I ha&s;ten to the &s;econd advantage I men|tioned as peculiar to the dead languages; to wit, that by deriving terms from them into the arts and &s;ciences, a my&s;terious ob&s;curity is obtained, which throws a veil over the face of truth, and &s;creens the rays of knowledge from vulgar eyes.</P>
<P>WHEN the barbarous nations of the north over|ran Europe, they obliterated almo&s;t; every trace of &s;cience: a few monks only were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;eeds of learning, contained in the remaining works of ancient authors. When the day of knowledge again began to dawn, the&s;e manu&s;cripts were held in great repute; and when printing was invented, copies of them were exceedingly mul|tiplied. As the&s;e were then the &s;ources of &s;cience, no man was e&s;teemed learned, who had not &s;tu|died the languages in which they were written. Such was their u&s;e at that time: very different, but not le&s;s important, is their u&s;e at this day: by means of repeated tran&s;lations, the trea&s;ures of the ancients have been laid open to public view. Science, dive&s;ted of my&s;tery, would lo&s;e its value, and men of learning forfeit that re&s;pect which the vulgar owe to profound erudition, were it not that
<PB N="54" REF="024407_0447_0FC7010A2BEE3B28">
the philo&s;opher, the &s;cholar, the man of &s;cience in every department, hath taken care to borrow a profu&s;ion of technical terms from the learned lan|guages, which throws a mantle of my&s;tery over his profe&s;&s;ion, and covers the &s;ecrets of his art from the admiring multitude: &s;o that modern learning con&s;i&s;ts, not &s;o much in the &s;tudy of <HI>things,</HI> as in the knowledge of <HI>terms.</HI> The author of <HI>Hudibras</HI> very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that</P>
<L>"All a rhetorician's rules</L>
<L>"Teach nothing but to name his tools."</L>
<P>AND &s;o it is, for the mo&s;t part, in every &s;cience &mdash;and &s;o it ought to be&mdash;for if it were otherwi&s;e; if the terms u&s;ed by men of learning were given in the vulgar tongue, every body would under&s;tand them, and &s;cience &s;oon become contemptible. For in&s;tance; a grave and learned phy&s;ician thus in|forms his patient:
<Q>Sir, your di&s;order is an <HI>an|thrax,</HI> and I &s;hall pre&s;cribe an emollient <HI>cata|pla&s;m.</HI></Q>
The poor man is filled with fear, won|der, and re&s;pect: but had he been told in plain Engli&s;h&mdash;
<Q>You have got a boil, and mu&s;t apply a poultice of bread and milk;</Q>
he would de&s;pi&s;e both the doctor and the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is the Greek and Latin languages that fur|ni&s;h
<PB N="55" REF="024407_0448_0FC7011094753A78">
the&s;e high &s;ounding words, &s;o &s;ingular to the ear, when the &s;en&s;e is concealed.</P>
<P>SOUNDS have a delightful effect upon the hu|man mind; e&s;pecially articulated &s;ounds: and the effect is &s;till more certain, when they have either no meaning at all, or the meaning is not under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>AN ignorant woman, weeping aloud under the influence of a powerful preacher, was a&s;ked the cau&s;e of her lamentation: Oh, &s;ir! &s;aid &s;he, don't you hear tho&s;e charming words, <HI>Me&s;opotamia, Pam|phylia,</HI> and <HI>Phrygia?</HI> And I knew a lady during the late war, who did not po&s;&s;e&s;s one political principle, or had any preci&s;e idea of the real cau&s;e of conte&s;t between Great-Britain and America, and yet was a profe&s;&s;ed and confirmed <HI>tory:</HI> merely from the fa&s;cination of &s;ounds. The <HI>imperial crown,</HI> the <HI>royal robes,</HI> the <HI>high court of parliament,</HI> the <HI>lord chancellor of England,</HI> and &s;o on, were words of irre&s;i&s;tible influence. Whil&s;t captain <HI>A,</HI> the taylor; colonel <HI>B,</HI> the tavern-keeper; and even <HI>general Wa&s;hington,</HI> the farmer, only created con|tempt. But I am per&s;uaded, if &s;ome Indian chief, with a long Cherokee or Mohawk name, had com|manded

our armies, &s;he would have thought much more re&s;pectably of the American cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS being truth, and a truth founded in na|ture, will any one pretend to &s;ay, that the Greek and Latin languages are of no u&s;e? What! &s;hall we call things by downright vulgar Engli&s;h names? Shall not the phy&s;ician have his <HI>paregorics</HI> and <HI>an|ti&s;pa&s;modics;</HI>
his <HI>lenitives</HI> and <HI>&s;edatives;</HI> his <HI>anti|phlogi&s;tics, cathartics,</HI> and <HI>diuretics?</HI> Shall not the lawyer have his <HI>fieri facias,</HI> his <HI>&s;cire facias,</HI> and <HI>cer|tiorares?</HI>
Or the divine his <HI>latitudinarians, millena|rians, &s;ublap&s;arians,</HI> and <HI>&s;upralap&s;arians?</HI> Shall the chymi&s;t give up his hard words, and the botani&s;t his technical terms, in the knowledge of which his whole &s;cience con&s;i&s;ts? Deplorable will be the &s;tate of erudition when this &s;hall be the ca&s;e. Know|ledge, indeed, might encrea&s;e and become more u|niver&s;ally diffu&s;ed; but <HI>learning</HI> would be no more.

<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have lately been entertained with an ex|hibition, which, for novelty, &s;plendor, and decorum ju&s;tly merited univer&s;al admiration and applau&s;e. If, be&s;ides the magnificence of the thing it&s;elf, we take into con&s;ideration the important occa&s;ion that induced it, it mu&s;t be acknowledged to have been an object mo&s;t intere&s;ting and truly &s;ub|lime.</P>
<P>YOU will readily &s;uppo&s;e, that I refer to the <HI>grand federal proce&s;&s;ion,</HI> performed in celebration of that memorable day which gave to our coun|try <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>independence</HI>; and al&s;o of the late

happy e&s;tabli&s;hment of a liberal and efficient go|vernment, on which the future dignity and pro&s;|perity of America is to be founded.</P>
<P>TO give &s;tability, energy, and re&s;pectability to go|vernment&mdash;to concenter the &s;trength of a nation for national purpo&s;es; and at the &s;ame time leave to the people at large a full &s;ecurity in, and enjoyment of, e&s;&s;ential rights, is a problem in politics which has employed the pens of the mo&s;t enlightened men in every civilized age and country; may we not hope that it was re&s;erved for the genius of America to &s;olve this difficult problem; and &s;hew to the world a &s;y&s;tem of government po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the requi&s;ites which theory demands, and producing all the effects which can rea&s;onably be expected from experiment?</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tances under which our federal con&s;titution hath been framed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, are &s;o new and unprecedented, that we may hope for new and unprecedented good con&s;equences in its operation.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t outlines of mo&s;t of the political &s;y|&s;tems of Europe were originally de&s;ignated by the &s;word, not by the pen; were the fruits of con|que&s;t, or the offsprings of rude nece&s;&s;ity, not the production of deliberate choice, the con&s;equences
<PB N="64" REF="024407_0457_0FC70131CDDADC18">
are accordingly manife&s;t. In &s;ome in&s;tances, an unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of mutilated rights; in others, a total pro&s;tra|tion of the maje&s;ty of the people, and adegradation di&s;honourable to human nature.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>here,</HI> the ca&s;e hath been far otherwi&s;e. No &s;ucce&s;sful hero hath, by chance of war, obtain|ed a power to pre&s;cribe a mode of government to the people; but the people have by their valour obtained the right and the opportunity of fra|ming a government for them&s;elves: and this, not a barbarous and uninformed multitude; but a peo|ple highly civilized, who know what government is, and what it ought to be; and who had before their eyes the experience of ancient times, and the pre&s;ent examples of the world.</P>
<P>THUS &s;ituated, and thus in&s;tructed, they &s;elected, by a free choice, a competent number of tried pa|triots and able &s;tate&s;men, to frame for them a &s;y&s;tem of general government.

<P>IF my fellow-citizens &s;ee this matter in the light I do, they will bring this law to the te&s;t, by making the following experiment:&mdash;let three or four re|&s;pectable citizens (having an indi&s;putable right to vote) in each or any of the counties, re&s;erve their tickets till &s;ome &s;hort time after eight o'clock, and then offer them to the proper officers in the pre|&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es. If their votes &s;hould be refu|&s;ed, as they probably will, let a &s;uit be in&s;tituted, and &s;o bring the que&s;tion to a legal i&s;&s;ue: I am per&s;uaded there is no court but will adjudge the act to be illegal and of no force, as to this clau&s;e,
<PB N="82" REF="024407_0475_0FC7016F66458410">
becau&s;e the con&s;titution is paramount to any act of a&s;&s;embly; and it expre&s;sly declares, that the free|men of the &s;tate may vote on the &s;econd Tue&s;day in October for ever.</P>
<P>IF the a&s;&s;embly have a right to limit the time of voting to eight o'clock, they have the &s;ame right to fix it at &s;even, or &s;ix, or three: and &s;o &s;ome future a&s;&s;embly may take from us the right of voting al|together, by making the period &s;o &s;hort, that, by the time the clerks have ruled their books and mended their pens, the golden moments may elap&s;e, and the minutes of grace pa&s;s away.</P>
<P>A curious que&s;tion in law.&mdash;Does the act mean <HI>true</HI> or <HI>apparent</HI> time? For the &s;un will on that day be 12 minutes too fa&s;t: be this as it may, it will be very proper that the &s;tate-hou&s;e clock &s;hould be cleaned, and put under good regulation, previous to the election, and that it &s;hould be &s;et with great accuracy on the morning of the day (if any morn|ing can be allowed to a day of &s;ix hours) by &s;ome &s;worn arti&s;t, and in the pre&s;ence of the judges. But I don't know what they will do in the coun|try, where there are no public clocks: the watches of the judges may happen to go a little too fa&s;t, or too &s;low, according to their judgment of the run of votes. For, let me ob&s;erve, that ten or a dozen

At the en&s;uing election, it was manife&s;t when eight o'clock drew near, that the run of votes had been in favour of the republican tick|et: &s;oon afterwards a &s;trong body of the con&s;titutionali&s;ts came up to vote, but the clock &s;truck, and it was in&s;i&s;ted that the election &s;hould be clo&s;ed according to the law.

<HEAD>A WORD OF ADVICE: OR THE PENNSYLVANIA ASSEMBLYMAN'S VADE-MECUM.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylva|nia, among&s;t other good things, enjoins that the people &s;hould choo&s;e men <HI>mo&s;t noted for wi&s;dom,</HI> to repre&s;ent them in general a&s;&s;embly; yet as electors are not always &s;o attentive to this injunction as they &s;hould be, it may be pre&s;umed that in &s;o promi&s;cuous a body as our general a&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed of men collected from every part of the &s;tate, there may be &s;ome, to whom a word or two of in&s;truction may not be ami&s;s. To &s;uch, if any &s;uch there &s;hould be in our pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embly, the following rules of legi&s;lative conduct are &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="85" REF="024407_0478_0FC70178E8F4C1A8">1^&s;^t. You are to con&s;ider your election into the general a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tate, as one of the mo&s;t important events of your life; becau&s;e the powers with which the con&s;titution hath inve&s;ted you, and the duties of your &s;tation, are of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and &s;erious con&s;equences: no le&s;s than to bear a part in the framing and e&s;tabli&s;hing of laws, which are to bind the citizens of this great common|wealth: and therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2^d. You are to con&s;ider your&s;elf not merely a member for the county which elected you, but a repre&s;entative of the &s;tate at large; con&s;equent|ly, &s;hould the &s;uppo&s;ed particular intere&s;ts of that county come in competition with the general in|tere&s;ts of the &s;tate, you &s;hould not he&s;itate in giv|ing it up: for the public good &s;hould be the polar &s;tar of your conduct. Members of a&s;&s;embly are too apt to think, that if by their vote or influence they can &s;creen the county in which they live from a &s;hare of the public burthen, or procure for it &s;ome extraordinary privilege, they will merit great applau&s;e from their neighbours, whom they &s;up|po&s;e their only con&s;tituents. But &s;uch narrow principles di&s;honour the &s;eat of legi&s;lation. A com|monwealth is one body politic: its divi&s;ion into counties is artificial, and for convenience in the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and other good purpo&s;es;
<PB N="86" REF="024407_0479_0FC7017B857ADCD0">
but the true intere&s;ts of each, and of the whole, are in&s;eparable. Should members of a&s;&s;embly accu&s;|tom them&s;elves to think otherwi&s;e, and boa&s;t of advantages gained for a particular county at the expence of the general good, it would be, as if the left hand &s;hould boa&s;t, that it had cunningly con|trived to make the right hand do the mo&s;t work. If you ought not to con&s;ider your&s;elf as the repre|pre&s;entative only of a particular county; much le&s;s are you to &s;uppo&s;e that it is your duty to &s;upport, at all events, the intere&s;ts and influence of a de&s;ignated party. Such a conduct would be a direct violation of your oath of office.</P>
<P N="3">3^d. THE people have ve&s;ted you <HI>per&s;onally</HI> with the power of legi&s;lation, and you cannot delegate or a&s;&s;ign that power to any other per&s;on or per|&s;ons whatever. Your con&s;tituents look for the exerci&s;e of <HI>your</HI> judgment, and for <HI>your</HI> vote foun|ded thereon, and not for another's through you. Attend to arguments and opinions, within and without; make full u&s;e of every means that may inform your under&s;tanding: but when you come to give your vote, let that vote be purely and &s;trict|ly your own. It would be a wicked pro&s;titution of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you, &s;hould you, by any compact with a &s;elect number of your brethren, bind your&s;elf to give your voice contrary to your

judgement: for in&s;tance, &s;hould you hold private meetings with &s;uch &s;elect members, and engage with them to give your <HI>aye</HI> or <HI>nay</HI> in the general a&s;&s;embly, on a que&s;tion to be agitated, according to the determination of a majority of this private a&s;&s;embly,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A known practice of the con&s;titutional party.</NOTE> this would be a very &s;erious and dan|gerous offence&mdash;an offence for which you might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e impeached and di&s;graced.</P>
<P N="4">4^t^h. As the people expect to be governed by laws of your making, it is highly improper to apply to the judges of the &s;upreme court to frame bills for you, or to revi&s;e bills already framed; except in ca&s;es of mere technical knowledge. Judges &s;hould have nothing to do with the making of laws, which they are afterwards to explain and execute. It is a determined maxim in politics, that the legi&s;|lative and executive powers of government &s;hould be kept carefully &s;eparate and di&s;tinct. How very improper would it be, &s;hould a judge, in explaining a di&s;puted point of law, have it in his power to &s;ay &mdash;I know the intention of the legi&s;lature to have been thus, or thus, <HI>for I my&s;elf framed and drew this law.</HI> It is always dangerous to &s;uffer the judges to tamper with the laws of the land, in any &s;tage of their proce&s;s, either in the making or pub|li&s;hing them. Much better would it be for the
<PB N="88" REF="024407_0481_0FC70189EAC89360">
people to receive the laws pure from the &s;ource of legi&s;lation, even though a few technical errors &s;hould &s;ometimes occur, than to &s;ubmit them to be <HI>revi&s;ed, corrected,</HI> and <HI>amended</HI> by the learning of the bench, e&s;pecially in a con&s;titution which admits but of one branch of legi&s;lature. Should an oc|ca&s;ion happen wherein the hou&s;e would wi&s;h to be informed on a mere point of law, the proper way is, to &s;tate queries in writing, and &s;end them to the judges for their an&s;wer: but on no account &s;hould a bill of the hou&s;e be &s;ubmitted to their correction. The judges already have a very formidable influ|ence in the execution of the laws: if, by cu&s;tom, they &s;hould acquire a like influence over the mak|ing of them, the people would be expo&s;ed to all the dangers of an ab&s;olute government, without even the &s;mall &s;ecurity of re&s;pon&s;ibility. If the &s;ame officious hands are to cook the broth, and make us &s;up it, we &s;hall &s;oon have rea&s;on to complain of &s;calded mouths and &s;ick &s;tomachs.</P>
<P N="5">5^t^h. As it is of the greate&s;t importance that the acts of the legi&s;lature, and the minutes of the hou&s;e, &s;hould be pre&s;erved pure and unadul|terated, it may not be ami&s;s to keep a watch|ful eye over the clerk of the hou&s;e, as it is much in his power to play tricks with the laws, minutes, and papers of the a&s;&s;embly, &s;hould he be &s;o di&s;po|&s;ed.
<PB N="89" REF="024407_0482_0FC7018B3A6CD150">
To prevent this, it is your duty to &s;ee that the laws, as &s;oon as enacted, are faithfully and im|mediately lodged in the roll's-office, and upon no no account &s;uffer the clerk to take them to his own lodgings.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE BILL ENTITLED "AN ACT FOR AMENDING THE PENAL LAWS OF THIS STATE."</HEAD>
<P>THE bill publi&s;hed for con&s;ideration, entitled
<Q>an act for amending the penal laws of this &s;tate,</Q>
will probably be taken up before long, in order to be pa&s;&s;ed into a law.</P>
<P>So great a revolution in the municipal law of our country, ought not to take place without due con&s;ideration on the part of the legi&s;lature, and &s;uch attention to the &s;ubject by the citizens at large, as the importance of it &s;eems to require.</P>
<P>I have daily looked for &s;ome &s;trictures on this bill in our public papers, and am &s;urpri&s;ed to find that it hath hitherto pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed. When|ever a public act is likely to interfere with the in|tere&s;ts or views of any &s;et of men, or party, all hands go to work, and we are di&s;tracted with ar|guments <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con;</HI> but mea&s;ures which have
<PB N="94" REF="024407_0487_0FC7019BAC35D730">
not that immediate tendency, however replete with remote mi&s;chief, are too frequently neglect|ed, although a little timely exertion might prevent evils which, when they arrive, cannot ea&s;ily be removed.</P>
<P>A report has been lately made to the hou&s;e, recommending an abridgement of the fees and &s;a|laries of public officers. Immediately the whole fraternity is in an uproar&mdash;the craft&mdash;the craft is in danger! At the head of the malecontents, with &s;olemn &s;tep and &s;tately &s;tride, appears the pro|found and formidable <HI>Juri&s;peritus,</HI> &s;ounding forth his own prai&s;e, as with a brazen trumpet, and loudly de&s;canting on his va&s;t abilities and un|paralleled &s;ervices. One might &s;uppo&s;e, from his account, that if the gentlemen at pre&s;ent in office &s;hould be affronted, and throw up their commi&s;|&s;ions, the whole commonwealth could not furni&s;h another &s;et of equal wi&s;dom, integrity, and &s;ound whiggi&s;m.</P>
<P>THE lamentable outcry of <HI>Juri&s;peritus</HI> has led me to con&s;ider the bill under con&s;ideration, only in one point of view, viz. the enormous power it will ve&s;t in the judges of the &s;upreme court, in ad|dition to tho&s;e other powers which have been
<PB N="95" REF="024407_0488_0FC7019D334342B0">
from time to time accumulating in their hands. Let us look at the li&s;t which <HI>Juri&s;peritus</HI> hath him&s;elf enumerated.</P>
<P>BESIDES the great power and influence nece&s;|&s;arily attendant on the office of chief ju&s;tice&mdash;
<Q>he is, by vitue of that office, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;hould have &s;aid by virtue of &s;pecial acts of a&s;&s;embly, or an ordinance of congre&s;s.</NOTE> judge in the high court of errors and appeals; a judge of the court of admiralty &s;e&s;&s;ions for the United States of America; a judge of the court of admiralty &s;e&s;&s;ions for this &s;tate, and a tru&s;tee of the uni|univer&s;ity. He is al&s;o to decide upon all claims again&s;t e&s;tates forfeited to the commonwealth, and the forfeiting per&s;ons; and has power to perpetuate te&s;timony; take care of the per&s;ons and e&s;tates of ideots and lunaticks; and is to de|termine all cau&s;es relating to alimony and di|vorce.</Q>
To this catalogue our pre&s;ent a&s;&s;em|bly have added an act to empower the ju&s;tices of the &s;upreme court to &s;upply defects in the titles to lands, occa&s;ioned by the lo&s;s of deeds, &amp;c. and the now propo&s;ed bill for amending the penal laws, will give them a power to puni&s;h criminals ac|cording to their di&s;cretion, within the limits of fourteen years cruel &s;ervitude.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="024407_0489_0FC6FD0377C6AFC0">WHEN we con&s;ider the &s;um total of power, and of cour&s;e of influence, thus in&s;en&s;ibly accumulating in the hands of two or three individuals, it &s;eems highly expedient that government &s;hould not only avoid further delegations of &s;pecial powers; but keep a watchful eye over the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e al|ready delegated.</P>
<P>THERE is not, in our &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence, a more formidable body of operative power than that ve&s;ted in the judges of the &s;upreme court. The executive council, and hou&s;e of a&s;&s;em|bly, are compo&s;ed of many individuals, and the&s;e liable to annual changes; but the judges are few in number, and permanent in office for &s;even years at lea&s;t, and hold their commi&s;&s;ions, as <HI>Juri&s;peritus</HI>
ob&s;erves, in fact, during good behaviour. The exact time at which a judge's commi&s;&s;ion expires, is not matter of public notoriety: when this hap|pens, it may be renewed in &s;o &s;ecret and &s;peedy a manner by his friends in council, that before tho&s;e who may have been injured by mal-admini&s;tration can make complaint, or the people have an oppor|tunity of expre&s;&s;ing their di&s;gu&s;t, if any there &s;hould be, the judge is re-in&s;tated, and then no dog mu&s;t bark. Exce&s;&s;ive power has a natural tendency to debauch the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition; but when it falls into the hands of a proud, capricious, and ambi|tious
<PB N="97" REF="024407_0490_0FC6FD064CD16EE0">
man, its operation &s;hould be watched with a jealous eye.</P>
<P>THE effect of the propo&s;ed alteration in the pe|nal laws, will be to inve&s;t the judges of the &s;u|preme court with a <HI>di&s;cretionary</HI> power to puni&s;h within certain limits. This is, in fact, ve&s;ting them with legi&s;lative authority within tho&s;e limits. It is a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of a free government, that the people &s;hall know before hand, the penal|ty which the laws annex to every offence; and, therefore, &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem is called a government of of laws, and not of men. But within the &s;cope of the pre&s;ent bill, no offender can tell what his pu|ni&s;hment is to be, till after conviction. The <HI>quan|tum,</HI> at lea&s;t, is to be determined by the particular &s;tate of mind the judge happens to be in at the time of pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence. Vexations and di&s;ap|pointments may &s;end his honour to court in a ve|ry ill humour, and then wo to the culprits.</P>
<P><Q>THE knowledge of this part of juri&s;prudence (&s;ays Black&s;tone, vol. IV. p. 2.) which teaches the nature, extent, and degrees of every crime, and adju&s;ts to it its adequate and nece&s;&s;ary pe|nalty, is of the utmo&s;t importance to every in|dividual in the &s;tate. For, (as a very great

The in|firmities of the be&s;t among&s;t us, the vices and un|governable pa&s;&s;ions of others, the in&s;tability of all human affairs, and the numberle&s;s unfore&s;een events which the compa&s;s of a day may bring forth, will teach us, upon a moment's reflection, that to know <HI>with preci&s;ion</HI> what the laws of our country have forbidden, and the deplorable con&s;equences to which a wilful di&s;obedience may expo&s;e us, is a matter of univer&s;al con|cern</Q>&mdash;<Q>The criminal law (p. 3.) &s;hould be founded upon principles which are <HI>permanent, uniform,</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al.</HI></Q></P>

But the effect of a pardon is to re&s;tore him, in the eye of the law, to the &s;ame credit he had before the accu&s;ation (except only in ca&s;es where the blood is attainted). The power of pardon is lodged, in England, (other than in ca&s;es of im|peachment) exclu&s;ively in the crown: and, in Penn&s;ylvania in the executive council. But, by this bill, the power of pardon, after puni&s;hment, is ve&s;ted in the &s;ame men who awarded the penalty&mdash; a power incompatible with the genius of the common law, or the common rules of political prudence.</P>

the inherent virtues of his com|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I am far from objecting to the general intent of this bill: I think, with the a&s;&s;embly, that the Bri|ti&s;h criminal law, which hath hitherto been our model, is by much too &s;anguinary, and has an|nexed puni&s;hments to crimes in very undue pro|portions&mdash;proportions not drawn from policy, rea&s;on, or equity. But this bill, if pa&s;&s;ed into a law, will make the matter wor&s;e than before. I acknowledge, that under the &s;y&s;tem propo&s;ed by this bill, a di&s;cretionary power mu&s;t be lodged &s;omewhere, and think it can no where be lodged &s;o &s;afely as with the jury who find the fact. The proportion of puni&s;hment, equitably due according to the nature of the offence, is not a que&s;tion in|volved in the technical &s;ubtleties of the law; but ari&s;es from the particular circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, all things con&s;idered; and an hone&s;t, impar|tial, and con&s;cientious jury, are as competent to this purpo&s;e, as the mo&s;t profound judge. They will nece&s;&s;arily have heard the &s;tate of the whole matter, with the arguments for the pro&s;ecution, and in behalf of the pri&s;oner; and being a tempo|rary body, accidentally brought together, and im|pannelled for the occa&s;ion, are more likely to do &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice, than a judge who is &s;o hackneyed

<P>As juries determine the <HI>quantum</HI> of damage in a civil action, there &s;eems to be no rea&s;on why they &s;hould not al&s;o determine the <HI>quantum</HI> of pu|ni&s;hment in a criminal proce&s;s, within &s;uch li|mits as the law &s;hall pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>WHY &s;hould the legi&s;lature a&s;&s;ign &s;o large and dangerous a field of power to judges, becau&s;e of their &s;uppo&s;ed law knowledge, in a matter where law knowledge can be of no po&s;&s;ible u&s;e?

<HEAD>For the Penn&s;ylvania Packet.</HEAD>
<P>I OBSERVE by the paper of this day, that Wed|ne&s;day next is appointed by our hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly for taking up the bill called <HI>the penal law,</HI> which has been publi&s;hed for con&s;ideration, and is now ripe for the forms of legi&s;lation. This bill &s;eems to be of very &s;erious importance in the juri&s;prudence of our commonwealth. Innovations are always to be &s;u&s;pected, and prudence dictates that novel|ties, under the gui&s;e of improvement, &s;hould be &s;trictly &s;crutinized, le&s;t an o&s;ten&s;ible benefit &s;hould &s;erve as an introduction to many overballancing evils. But I tru&s;t that our repre&s;entatives will proceed with proper caution in a mea&s;ure which will not only change the long e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem of penal laws, but will, in effect, amount to a transfer of the great power of apportioning puni&s;hments to crimes from the &s;overeignty of the &s;tate, where it certainly ought to be, to two or three individuals, where it certainly ought not to be.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="024407_0500_0FC6FD27F977BF08">I heartily approve of the general purpo&s;e of this bill, in making penal laws le&s;s &s;anguinary, by &s;ub|&s;tituting periods of di&s;graceful labour in the room of fatal executions and corporal puni&s;hments; but in as much as it leaves the apportionment of the&s;e periods to the di&s;cretion of the &s;upreme court, it is a bill pregnant with dangerous con&s;e|quences, and e&s;tabli&s;hes a de&s;potic form of go|vernment within the field of its operation. For, true de&s;poti&s;m is nothing more than a power to puni&s;h according to will and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>TRUE it is, that our legi&s;lature &s;till re&s;erves the right of a&s;certaining the crime; but if the degree of puni&s;hment is to be determined by the will of the court, it may not be long before &s;ome learned judge will enlarge on the inconvenience of the le|gi&s;lature's troubling it&s;elf with &s;uch matters, and prepare a bill for inve&s;ting him&s;elf, and his bre|thren, with the whole di&s;pen&s;ation of criminal law.</P>
<P>IN a government like ours, it is highly nece&s;&s;ary to be watchful over the movements of tho&s;e in whom we confide&mdash;much more &s;o than in go|vernments le&s;s free; becau&s;e tho&s;e in whom we tru&s;t have the all powerful &s;anction of the people at large for whatever they do within the precincts
<PB N="108" REF="024407_0501_0FC6FD29548547D8">
of legal power, and it is certainly within the&s;e limits to ruin us according to law.</P>
<P>OUR a&s;&s;embly have undoubtedly a right to enact this bill into a law&mdash;Let us indulge imagi|nation in, at lea&s;t, po&s;&s;ible con&s;equences &s;hould it be enacted.</P>
<P>OUR judges have unavoidably an official in|fluence over the petit jury in criminal trials. They al&s;o recommend to council for pardon, when they think fit, and the council not only ne|ver execute again&s;t their recommendation; but, as I am told, &s;eldom pardon without it. And now, by this bill, they are to be empowered by law to apportion puni&s;hments to crimes according to their own di&s;cretion. By their means the &s;everi|ties of law and the high prerogative of mercy will be ve&s;ted in the &s;ame individuals&mdash;In men &s;ubject to pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices, are unfit to be &s;o highly tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a ca&s;e&mdash;<HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI> have committed preci&s;ely the &s;ame offence, viz. Burglary. <HI>A</HI> has re&s;pectable connections and friends; <HI>B</HI> has none. <HI>A</HI>'s friends are not only re&s;pectable, but they happen to be of the &s;ame party in the politicks of the &s;tate with his honour: or they belong to
<PB N="109" REF="024407_0502_0FC6FD2C6A74DDB0">
the &s;ame religious congregation. <HI>B</HI> is a foreigner; he has no friends or connections; or, if he has, they are of the adver&s;e party to the judge&mdash;may we not &s;uppo&s;e the di&s;cretion of the court would exerci&s;e it&s;elf very differently with re&s;pect to the&s;e criminals, however equal their demerits? A few days may &s;erve to expiate the crime of <HI>A</HI>; but <HI>B</HI> mu&s;t labour fourteen years for not having better friends and more powerful influence in his fa|vour. This may &s;eem too &s;trong a ca&s;e; but it is no more than what the law will ju&s;tify. Any &s;peci|ous rea&s;ons for &s;uch a di&s;crimination will be &s;uffici|ent to excu&s;e the judges as men, for what they may do as officers, under the law.</P>
<P>IF it did not appear from the face of this bill that it is a direct violation of our con&s;titution, by making our government a government of men, and not of laws in criminal ca&s;es; yet the quarter from which it originated ought to rai&s;e a virtuous jealou&s;y in the minds of the people. It is a dan|gerous &s;ymptom when we &s;ee men, already high in power, gra&s;ping &s;till at more, and ever devi&s;ing ways and means to encrea&s;e their official influ|ence.</P>
<P>TO point out all the evils, and political &s;ole|ci&s;ms of the bill under con&s;ideration, would require more time, and more law knowledge, than I can
<PB N="110" REF="024407_0503_0FC6FD2F14EFE8B8">
command; but I am confident that &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment will be injurious to the &s;ecurity and ju&s;tice intended by the common law, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the &s;pirit of our free con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I hope our legi&s;lature will not ha&s;tily part with &s;o high a prerogative of &s;overeign power, or &s;ubject the citizens of this &s;tate, who may hereafter of|fend, to be puni&s;hed at the di&s;cretion of the judges.</P>
<P>I conclude with an extract to the purpo&s;e from 4 Black. ch. 29. pa. 377.</P>
<P><Q>It is, moreover, one of the glories of our Engli&s;h law, that the nature, though not always the quantity or degrees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This re&s;pects pecuniary fines, which, as the author afterwards explains, cannot be fixed preci&s;ely by law, but mu&s;t vary according to the nature of the offence, the abilities of the offender, and other circum&s;tances.</NOTE>, of puni&s;hment, is a&s;|certained for every offence; and that it is not left in the brea&s;t of any judge, or even of a jury, to alter the judgement which the law has beforehand ordained for every &s;ubject alike, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons. For if judgments were to be the private opinions of the judge, men would then be &s;laves to their magi&s;trates,
<PB N="111" REF="024407_0504_0FC6FD368D62A2C0">
and would live in &s;ociety without exactly knowing the conditions and obligations which it lays them under. And be&s;ides, as this pre|vents oppre&s;&s;ion on the one hand; &s;o, on the other it &s;tifles all hopes of impunity or mitigation with which an offender might flatter him&s;elf, if, his puni&s;hment depended on the humour or di&s;cretion of the court. Whereas, where an e&s;tabli&s;hed penalty is annexed to crimes, the criminal may read their certain con&s;equence in that law which ought to be the unvaried rule, as it is the inflexible judge, of his actions.</Q></P>

<HEAD>A SUIT IN THE HIGH COURT OF HONOUR. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THIS piece of humour was founded on the idea of e&s;tabli&s;hing a high court of honour (See vol. I. page, 151), and accidentally occa&s;ioned the following &s;ingular ANECDOTE.</P>
<P>THE piece had been inclo&s;ed in a cover, addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>James Wil|&s;on</HI> E&s;q. for whom it was de&s;igned, and &s;ent to his hou&s;e. Mr Wil|&s;on not being at home, his &s;ervant received the packet, and &s;tuck it behind the parlour looking gla&s;s. Cap. &dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger; who was frequently deranged in his mind, and at &s;uch times full of notions of plots and con&s;piracies, went into Mr Wil&s;on's parlour wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hout knocking when none of the family happened to be there; and &s;eeing the packet in the frame of the looking gla&s;s took it down and went off with it.</P>
<P>THERE was at this time a cau&s;e agitated in the &s;upreme court of great popular attention, in which <HI>Mr Wil&s;on,</HI> and mo&s;t of the gen|tlemen of the bar, were engaged.</P>
<P>THE next day I went to court, and happening to be &s;eated near Mr. Wil&s;on, I a&s;ked him if he had received my packet; he told me he did not get home till late in the evening; that the &s;ervant in|formed him there had been a letter for him, and that he had put it behind the gla&s;s; but that it had all at once di&s;appeared, and no body could give any account of it, although enquiry had been made through the whole family.</P>
<P>WHILST we were thus talking, a cry of, make way there! was heard in the court, when capt. &dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;, having pu&s;hed his way through the crowd, appeared before the bar with papers in his hand. He interrupted the lawyer who was then &s;peaking, and in|formed the judges that he had papers in his hand which would immedi|ately clear up and determine the cau&s;e before the court; and that he had al&s;o di&s;covered a mo&s;t horrible and dangerous plot, partly a|gain&s;t the &s;tate, and partly again&s;t the judge of admiralty: confe&s;|&s;ing that he had made this great di&s;covery by breaking into and robbing that gentleman's hou&s;e, pointing to Mr. Wil&s;on; declaring that &s;o far as he was amenable for the robbery, he &s;tood ready to &s;ubmit to the laws.</P>
<P>THE papers, which I immediately knew to be mine, were handed up to the bench, and the chief ju&s;tice was preparing to read the contents aloud to the court; but I forced my way to him, and and whi&s;pered him, that it was only a piece of literary &s;port be- Mr. Wil&s;on and me, and very unfit for the public ear on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.

<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE REV. DOCTOR WHITE, RECTOR OF CHRIST CHURCH AND ST. PETER'S ON THE CONDUCT OF A CHURCH ORGAN.</HEAD>
<P>I AM one of tho&s;e who take great delight in &s;acred mu&s;ic, and think, with royal David, that heart, voice, and in&s;trument &s;hould unite in ado|ration of the great Supreme.</P>
<P>A &s;oul truly touched with love and gratitude, or under the influence of penitential &s;orrow, will unavoidably break forth in expre&s;&s;ions &s;uited to its feelings. In order that the&s;e emanations of the mind may be conducted with uniformity and a be|coming propriety, our church hath adopted into
<PB N="120" REF="024407_0513_0FC6FD5B6294C498">
her liturgy, the book of p&s;alms, commonly called <HI>David's P&s;alms,</HI> which contain a great variety of addre&s;&s;es to the Deity, adapted to almo&s;t every &s;tate and temperature of a devout heart, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed in terms always proper, and often &s;ublime.</P>
<P>TO give wings, as it were to this holy zeal, and heighten the harmony of the &s;oul, <HI>organs</HI> have been introduced into the churches. The appli|cation of in&s;trumental mu&s;ic to the purpo&s;es of piety is well known to be of very ancient date. Indeed, originally, it was thought that mu&s;ic ought not to be applied to any other purpo&s;e. Modern improvements, however, have di&s;covered, that it may be made expre&s;&s;ive of every pa&s;&s;ion of the mind, and become an incitement to levity as well as &s;anctity.</P>
<P>UNLESS the real de&s;ign for which an organ is placed in a church be con&s;tantly kept in view, no|thing is more likely to happen than an abu&s;e of this noble in&s;trument, &s;o as to render it rather an ob|&s;truction to, than an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in, the good pur|po&s;e for which the hearers have a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>GIVE me leave, &s;ir, to &s;ugge&s;t a few rules for the conduct of an organ in a place of wor&s;hip, according to my ideas of propriety.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="121" REF="024407_0514_0FC6FD609A495AD8">1^s^t. The organi&s;t &s;hould always keep in mind, that neither the time or place is &s;uitable for exhi|biting all his powers of execution; and that the congregation have not a&s;&s;embled to be entertained with his performance. The excellence of an or|gani&s;t con&s;i&s;ts in his making the in&s;trument &s;ub|&s;ervient and conducive to the purpo&s;es of devo|tion. None but a ma&s;ter can do this. An ordi|nary performer may play &s;urpri&s;ing tricks, and &s;hew great dexterity in running through difficult pa&s;&s;ages, which he hath &s;ubdued by dint of pre|vious labour and practice. But <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t have judgement and ta&s;te who can call forth the pow|ers of the in&s;trument, and apply them with propri|ety and effect to the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2^n^d. The voluntary, previous to reading the le&s;&s;ons, was probably de&s;igned to fill up a &s;olemn pau&s;e in the &s;ervice; during which, the clergyman takes a few minutes re&s;pite, in a duty too lengthy, perhaps, to be continued without fatigue, unle&s;s &s;ome intermi&s;&s;ion be allowed: there, the organ hath its part alone, and the organi&s;t an opportu|nity of &s;hewing his power over the in&s;trument. This, however, &s;hould be done with great di&s;cretion and dignity, avoiding every thing light and trivial; but rather endeavouring to compo&s;e the minds of the audience, and &s;trengthen the tendency of the
<PB N="122" REF="024407_0515_0FC6FD640408A760">
heart in tho&s;e devout exerci&s;es, in which, it &s;hould be pre&s;umed, the congregation are now engaged. All &s;udden jirks, &s;trong contra&s;ts of <HI>piano</HI> and <HI>forte,</HI> rapid execution, and expre&s;&s;ions of tumult, &s;hould be avoided. The voluntary &s;hould proceed with great cha&s;tity and decorum; the organi&s;t keeping in mind, that his hearers are now in the mid&s;t of divine &s;ervice. The full organ &s;hould &s;eldom be u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, nor &s;hould the voluntary la&s;t more than <HI>five minutes</HI> of time. Some relax|ation, however, of this rule may be allowed, on fe&s;tivals and grand occa&s;ions.</P>
<P N="3">3^d. The <HI>chants</HI> form a plea&s;ing and animating part of the &s;ervice; but it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that they are not &s;ongs or tunes, but a &s;pecies of <HI>recitative,</HI> which is no more than &s;peaking mu&s;ically. There|fore, as melody or &s;ong is out of the que&s;tion, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the harmony &s;hould be complete, otherwi&s;e <HI>chanting,</HI> with all the voices in uni&s;on, is too light and thin for the &s;olemnity of the occa|&s;ion. There &s;hould at lea&s;t be half a dozen voices in the organ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">llery to fill the harmony with ba&s;s and treble parts, and give a dignity to the per|formance. Melody may be frivolous; harmony, never.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="123" REF="024407_0516_0FC6FD6843CD9E18">4^t^h. The prelude which the organ plays imme|diately after the p&s;alm is given out, was intended to adverti&s;e the congregation of the p&s;alm tune which is going to be &s;ung; but &s;ome famous or|gani&s;t, in order to &s;hew how much he could make of a little, has introduced the cu&s;tom of running &s;o many divi&s;ions upon the &s;imple melody of a p&s;alm tune, that the original purpo&s;e of this pre|lude is now totally defeated, and the tune &s;o di&s;|gui&s;ed by the fanta&s;tical flouri&s;hes of the dexterous performer, that not an individual in the congrega|tion can po&s;&s;ibly gue&s;s the tune intended, until the clerk has &s;ung through the fir&s;t line of the p&s;alm. And it is con&s;tantly ob&s;ervable, that the full congregation never join in the p&s;alm before the &s;econd or third line, for want of that infor|mation which the organ &s;hould have given. The tune &s;hould be di&s;tinctly given out by the in&s;tru|ment, with only a few cha&s;te and expre&s;&s;ive deco|rations, &s;uch as none but a ma&s;ter can give.</P>
<P N="5">5^t^h. The interludes between the ver&s;es of the p&s;alm were de&s;igned to give the &s;ingers a little pau&s;e, not only to take breath, but al&s;o an oppor|tunity for a &s;hort retro&s;pect of the words they have &s;ung, in which the organ ought to a&s;&s;i&s;t their reflections. For this purpo&s;e the organi&s;t &s;hould be previou&s;ly informed by the clerk of the ver&s;es
<PB N="124" REF="024407_0517_0FC6FD69AFE1ACD8">
to be &s;ung, that he may modulate his interludes ac|cording to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>TO place this in a &s;trong point of view, no &s;tronger, however, than what I have too fre|quently ob&s;erved to happen; &s;uppo&s;e the congre|gation to have &s;ung the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the 33^d p&s;alm.</P>
<L>"Let all the ju&s;t to God with joy</L>
<L>Their chearful voices rai&s;e;</L>
<L>For well the righteous it becomes</L>
<L>To &s;ing glad &s;ongs of prai&s;e."</L>
<P>How di&s;&s;onant would it be for the organi&s;t to play a pathetic interlude in a flat third, with the &s;lender and di&s;tant tones of the echo organ, or the deep and &s;mothered &s;ounds of a &s;ingle diapa&s;on &s;top?</P>
<P>Or &s;uppo&s;e again, that the words &s;ung have been the 6^t^h ver&s;e of the vi^t^h p&s;alm.</P>
<L>"Quite tired with pain, with groaning faint,</L>
<L>No hope of ea&s;e I &s;ee,</L>
<L>The night, that quiets common griefs</L>
<L>Is &s;pent in tears by me"&mdash;</L>
<P><PB N="125" REF="024407_0518_0FC6FD6B29FEF230">
How mon&s;trou&s;ly ab&s;urd would it be to hear the&s;e words of di&s;tre&s;s &s;ucceeded by an interlude &s;elected from the fag end of &s;ome thundering figure on a full organ, and &s;pun out to a mo&s;t unrea&s;onable length? Or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, by &s;ome trivial melody with a rhythm &s;o &s;trongly marked, as to &s;et all the congregation to beating time with their feet or heads? Even tho&s;e who may be impre&s;&s;ed with the feelings &s;uch words &s;hould occa&s;ion, or in the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed for melancholy, mu&s;t be &s;hocked at &s;o gro&s;s in impropriety.</P>
<P>THE interludes &s;hould not be continued above 16 bars in <HI>triple,</HI> or ten or twelve bars in <HI>common</HI> time, and &s;hould always be adapted to the ver&s;e &s;ung: and herein the organi&s;t hath a fine oppor|tunity of &s;hewing his &s;en&s;ibility, and di&s;playing his ta&s;te and &s;kill.</P>
<P N="6">6^t^h. The voluntary after &s;ervice was never in|tended to eradicate every &s;erious idea which the &s;ermon may have inculcated. It &s;hould rather be expre&s;&s;ive of that chearful &s;atisfaction which a good heart feels under the &s;en&s;e of a duty perfor|med. It &s;hould bear, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome analogy with the di&s;cour&s;e delivered from the pulpit; at lea&s;t, it &s;hould not be totally di&s;&s;onant from it. If the preacher has had for his &s;ubject, penitence

for &s;in, the frailty and uncertainty of human life, or the evils incident to mortality, the voluntary may be &s;omewhat more chearful than the tenor of &s;uch a &s;ermon might in &s;trictne&s;s &s;ugge&s;t; but by no means &s;o full and free as a di&s;cour&s;e on prai&s;e, thank&s;giving, and joy, would authorize.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> general, the organ &s;hould ever pre&s;erve its dignity, and upon no account i&s;&s;ue light and poin|ted movements which may draw the attention of the congregation and induce them to carry home, not the &s;erious &s;entiments which the &s;ervice &s;hould impre&s;s, but &s;ome very petty air with which the organi&s;t hath been &s;o good as to entertain them.

<HEAD>SURVEYING.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been long urged by an invincible pro|perty to attempt &s;ome thing for the public good, or public convenience, &s;o as to render my name famous among&s;t the benefactors of mankind. As my de&s;ire is much &s;tronger than my abilities, I am obliged to be content with humble attempts at di&s;coveries of limited importance; for I confe&s;s that my genius is not of the highe&s;t rank.</P>
<P>THE project which has lately employed my thoughts, and which I am now about to commu|nicate, will not be valued as conducive to the happine&s;s of mankind in a &s;erious &s;en&s;e; yet I hope the novelty of the de&s;ign, and its affording a con|&s;iderable gratification at a very &s;mall expence, will entitle me to &s;ome reputation with the public: e&s;pe|cially when it &s;hall be con&s;idered, that I do not, like other projectors and di&s;coverers, make an emolu|ment of my ingenuity, but freely give the fruits of my &s;peculations to my beloved fellow citizens,
<PB N="128" REF="024407_0521_0FC6FD7AF031D848">
in the fir&s;t place, and through to them, to the world at large.</P>
<P>I have frequently thought that the arts and &s;ciences might be extended beyond the limits of their profe&s;&s;ed objects, and applied with advantage to other purpo&s;es than tho&s;e for which they &s;eem directly intended. I remember that when I was a boy, my father &s;aw me boring a hole with the leg of my compa&s;&s;es, for which he reproved me, and advi&s;ed me never to u&s;e a thing in a way which it was not de&s;igned&mdash;But <HI>Dr. Franklin,</HI> who was pre&s;ent&punc; declared him&s;elf of a different opinion; and &s;aid he had often admired the dexterity of a &s;er|vant who would occa&s;ionally &s;weep the hearth with the bellows, and blow the &s;ire with the hearth-bru&s;h.</P>
<P>I once &s;aw an elaborate work of an ingenious Frenchman, by which any per&s;on was enabled to compo&s;e an infinite number of minuets without the lea&s;t knowledge of mu&s;ic, or any other in&s;tru|ment, but a box and dice.</P>
<P>THIS readine&s;s in applying things to purpo&s;es for which they &s;eem not de&s;igned has often been of the greate&s;t importance in ca&s;es of extre|mity. The adventures of <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe,</HI> and
<PB N="129" REF="024407_0522_0FC6FD7C69618180">
the hi&s;tories of perilous voyages and &s;hip-wrecks, afford innumerable in&s;tances of the great advantage of &s;uch a talent.</P>
<P>I am by profe&s;&s;ion a <HI>&s;urveyer</HI>; not indeed of the fir&s;t rate reputation, yet I can execute my bu&s;ine&s;s with tolerable accuracy, and have given &s;atisfaction to my employers. I, not long &s;ince, &s;urveyed a tract of land, the boundaries of which were &s;o &s;ingular, that when I came to plot the lines and cour&s;es from my table book, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the &s;urvey exhibited the lines of a hu|man face. This &s;ugge&s;ted to me the idea of apply|ing the art of <HI>&s;urveying</HI> to the purpo&s;e of <HI>portrait painting</HI>&mdash;Only con&s;ider, candid reader, what an advantage this mu&s;t be to the world&mdash;Who is there that does not wi&s;h to &s;ee a true and faith|ful likene&s;s of tho&s;e eminent per&s;onages he reads of in hi&s;tory? Their actions indeed are recor|ded; but the&s;e may appear in very different lights to different people, and admit of very vari|ous comments, for want of knowing the &s;ecret mo|tives which influenced tho&s;e actions. Now there is no better way known, of a&s;certaining a man's intrin&s;ic character, than by the indication of his countenance: hence the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy, and the great encouragement <HI>portrait painting</HI>
hath found. But painting on canva&s;s is very ex|pen&s;ive,
<PB N="130" REF="024407_0523_0FC6FD895FC8CB88">
and original likene&s;&s;es very &s;carce. As to <HI>engravings,</HI> they are by no means to be depen|ded upon; every copyi&s;t varies more and more from the original: &s;o that by the time a man has been dead forty or fifty years, however emi|nent he may have been, the prints bearing his name, are no more like him, than the &s;ign of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia in third &s;treet is like that monarch. The thing &s;hould be brought to a <HI>mathematical</HI>
certainty. And this, I flatter my&s;elf, I have been &s;o lucky as to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>THE operation is quite ea&s;y, both to the party and to the arti&s;t. There is nothing more nece&s;|&s;ary that to take a correct outline of the per&s;on's profile, by throwing the &s;hadow of his face <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or of his whole per&s;on.</NOTE> upon a &s;heet of paper&mdash;a familiar and well known prac|tice, then let the arti&s;t take his &s;cale and dividers, and carefully mea&s;ure all the cour&s;es and di&s;tances of the lines which form the boundaries of the &s;hadow. By the &s;ame means of cour&s;es and di|&s;tances, the &s;ituation, form, and &s;ize of the eye, eye brow, mouth, &amp;c. &amp;c. may be preci&s;ely a&s;|certained; and thus by the help of a few letters and figures, may the exact likene&s;&s;es of great per|&s;onages be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, and made as
<PB N="131" REF="024407_0524_0FC6FD8B68AB4528">
public as a common adverti&s;ement, and at as little expence.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;atisfaction would it not afford us at this day to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an accurate &s;urvey of the faces of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar, Mark Anthony, Cicero, Virgil, Horace,</HI> and other renowned characters, who are now only known by their works and exploits.</P>
<P>MY project will, moreover, be particularly bene|ficial to private families; a man may, in the divi&s;ion of his e&s;tate, &s;o contrive it as to leave his likene&s;s in a tract of land. So that his grand&s;on will have nothing to do but con&s;ult his title deeds, take down the lines and cour&s;es of his farm, and by plotting them on paper may at any time pro|duce the portrait of his decea&s;ed ance&s;tor, and &s;urvey his ground and his grandfather at one and the &s;ame time; who&s;e re&s;emblance will be thus &s;e|cured to his family, &s;ubject to no variation, but the variation of the needle.</P>
<P>MY &s;cheme will be &s;ufficiently manife&s;ted by an example. And this I &s;hall give by tran&s;cribing from my table book the cour&s;es and di&s;tances of the tract of land which gave me the fir&s;t idea of applying the practice of &s;urveying to the purpo&s;es of portrait painting.</P>

we&s;tward. The&s;e three lines will form a mixed triangle, whereof two of the legs will be right lines, and the third a portion of a &s;phere. The northern leg of this triangle is fringed with ru&s;hes, being the edge of a watery &s;oil, it mu&s;t therefore be penciled &s;omewhat thicker and &s;tronger than the &s;outhern leg, which &s;hould be rather faintly &s;ketched than ab&s;olutely drawn.</P>

<P>FROM the middle of the line S T, there is a circular piece of ri&s;ing ground, being 45 perches on the line S T, and &s;tretching &s;outh-we&s;terly 25 perches. At the foot of this ri&s;ing ground is a cop&s;e, thick covered with wild bru&s;h and coar&s;e underwood, of a circular &s;hape, who&s;e diameter from N. E. to S. W. is 45 perches, and from N. W. to S. E. 40 perches.</P>
<P>ALL the &s;pace bounded by the lines G, H, I, K, T, S, R, Q, P, is a cold, moi&s;t, and barren &s;oil, producing nothing but a profu&s;ion of coar&s;e reeds, rank and long. The&s;e have been &s;o blown down by we&s;terly winds, that from G they tend to the E. N. E; from P Q to the N. E. and from R S ea&s;twardly. The&s;e reeds run over the boundary line I K very &s;traggling and irre|gular, &s;o as to cover and conceal that line: and therefore the line I K mu&s;t not be drawn ab&s;o|lute, but only dotted, or traced, being no more than the average cour&s;e of the long reeds. From

the whole line T K, the reeds run due &s;outh, and are very thick and long. All this mu&s;t be ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the pencil. La&s;tly, all the &s;harp angles of the figure mu&s;t be moderately rounded off, and all the lines made &s;omewhat arching, but &s;paring|ly. The eye of the arti&s;t will be&s;t direct him how to dre&s;s the lines and angles &s;o as to an&s;wer the general de&s;ign.</P>
<P>IF the above cour&s;es and di&s;tances are carefully laid down upon paper, and the directions ob&s;erv|ed, they will produce the drawing of a human face: and if the draft&s;man &s;hould have any to|lerable judgment in things of this kind, and a warm imagination, he may fancy that he di&s;covers a likene&s;s of &s;ome per&s;on or other. I plotted my &s;cale of &frac12; inch to 100 perches.</P>
<P>I have it in contemplation to improve my device, by a&s;certaining, in fixed terms, the manner in which a profile &s;o drawn may be coloured to the life, and thereby make the likene&s;s perfect. For this purpo&s;e I had recour&s;e to <HI>heraldry;</HI> and hoped by means of <HI>or, argent, gules,</HI> &amp;c. to dictate preci&s;ely the complexion, colour of the hair, eyes, &amp;c. but could not find terms &s;ufficient to expre&s;s the nece&s;|&s;ary teints: and as to the termination <HI>i&s;h,</HI> which &s;ome make u&s;e of, as in bluei&s;h, greeni&s;h, redi&s;h,
<PB N="136" REF="024407_0529_0FC6FD9B27905390">
&amp;c. it is too vague and indeterminate for the pur|po&s;e. Unle&s;s, therefore, I can find &s;ome known art or &s;cience which will furni&s;h definitions of co|lours as certain and intelligible, as &s;urveying gives us lines and cour&s;es, I &s;hall be obliged to com|po&s;e a &s;et of appellations an&s;werable to all the principal colours, and as many of their gradations and mixtures as are u&s;ual in portrait painting. The&s;e being once admitted, will &s;erve for ever after. Thus, in engraving, the directions of the &s;trokes of the engraver a&s;certain the colours or <HI>blazoning</HI> of a coat of arms. When it became generally admitted that horizontal &s;trokes &s;hould indicate <HI>blue,</HI> perpendicular &s;trokes, <HI>red;</HI> dia|gonal &s;trokes, <HI>green;</HI> and &s;o on, all uncertain|tainty was removed.</P>
<P>PERHAPS Mr. Pine and Mr. Peale may take it into their heads, that I have made this di&s;covery public, with a malicious intention to injure them in their profe&s;&s;ion; but I prote&s;t before all men, that I have a con&s;iderable e&s;teem for tho&s;e ingenious gentlemen, and would willingly have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed my project out of tenderne&s;s to them, had not an urgent &s;en&s;e of the duty I owe to my fellow-citi|zens at large, overbalanced the influence of pri|vate attachments.</P>

<P>A Man who is <HI>di&s;po&s;ed</HI> to be entertained may find amu&s;ement in the mo&s;t common occurrences of life.

<HEAD>A LETTER FROM A GENTLEMAN IN AMERICA, TO HIS FRIEND IN EUROPE, ON WHITE-WASHING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE peculiar cu&s;toms of every country appear to &s;trangers awkward and ab&s;urd, but the inhabi|tants con&s;ider them as very proper and even ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Long habit impo&s;es on the under&s;tanding, and reconciles it to any thing that is not manife&s;tly pernicious or immediately de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>THE religion of a country is &s;carcely held in greater veneration than its e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms: and it is almo&s;t as difficult to produce an alteration in the one as in the other. Any interference of
<PB N="147" REF="024407_0540_0FC6FDC222A54728">
government for the reformation of natural cu&s;toms, however trivial and ab&s;urd they may be, never fails to produce the greate&s;t di&s;content, and &s;ometimes dangerous convul&s;ions. Of this there are frequent in&s;tances in hi&s;tory. Bad habits are mo&s;t &s;afely removed by the &s;ame means that e&s;tabli&s;hed them, viz. by imperceptible gradations, and the con&s;tant example and influence of the higher cla&s;s of the people.</P>
<P>WE are apt to conclude that the fa&s;hions and manners of our own country are mo&s;t rational and proper, becau&s;e the eye and the under&s;tanding have long &s;ince been reconciled to them, and we ridicule or condemn tho&s;e of other nations on account of their novelty: yet the foreigner will defend his national habits with at lea&s;t as much plau&s;ibility as we can our own. The truth is, that rea&s;on has little to do in the matter. Cu&s;toms are for the mo&s;t part arbitrary, and one nation has as good a right to fix its peculiarities as another. It is of no pur|po&s;e to talk of convenience as a &s;tandard: every thing becomes convenient by practice and habit.</P>
<P>I have read &s;omewhere of a nation (in Africa I think) which is governed by twelve coun&s;ellors. When the&s;e coun&s;ellors are to meet on public bu|&s;ine&s;s, twelve large earthen jars are &s;et in two rows,
<PB N="148" REF="024407_0541_0FC6FDC4F9E69220">
and filled with water. The coun&s;ellors enter the apartment one after another, &s;tark naked, and each leaps into a jar, where he &s;its up to the chin in water. When the jars are all filled with coun&s;el|lors, they proceed to deliberate on the great con|cerns of the nation. This, to be &s;ure, forms a very grote&s;que &s;cene; but the object is to tran&s;act the public bu&s;ine&s;s: they have been accu&s;tomed to do it in this way, and therefore it appears to them the mo&s;t rational and convenient way. Indeed, if we con&s;ider it impartially, there &s;eems to be no rea&s;on why a coun&s;ellor may not be as wi&s;e in an earthen jar as in an elbow chair; or why the good of the people may not be as maturely con&s;idered in the one as in the other.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hed manners of every country are the &s;tandards of propriety with the people who have adopted them; and every nation a&s;&s;umes the right of con&s;idering all deviations therefrom as barbari&s;ms and ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> have retained their laws and cu&s;|toms for ages immemorial: and although they have long had a commercial intercour&s;e with Eu|ropean nations, and are well acquainted with their improvements in the arts, and their modes of civi|lization, yet they are &s;o far from being convinced
<PB N="149" REF="024407_0542_0FC6FDCEED48CDD0">
of any &s;uperiority in the European manners, that their government takes the mo&s;t &s;erious mea&s;ures to prevent the cu&s;toms of foreigners taking root among&s;t them. It employs their utmo&s;t vigilance to enjoy the benefits of commerce, and at the &s;ame time guard again&s;t innovations that might affect the the charactere&s;tic manners of the people.</P>
<P>SINCE the di&s;covery of the <HI>Sandwich</HI> i&s;lands in the South-Sea, they have been vi&s;ited by &s;hips from &s;everal nations; yet the natives have &s;hewn no inclination to prefer the dre&s;s and manners of the vi&s;itors to their own. It is even probable that they pity the ignorance of the Europeans they have &s;een, as far removed from civilization; and value them&s;elves on the propriety and advantage of their own cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing new in the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and I had no intention of making them when I &s;at down to write, but they obtruded them&s;elves upon me. My intention was to give you &s;ome account of the people of the&s;e new &s;tates; but I am not &s;ufficiently informed for the purpo&s;e, having, as yet, &s;een little more than the cities of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> I have di&s;covered but few na|tional &s;ingularities among&s;t them. Their cu&s;toms and manners are nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of
<PB N="150" REF="024407_0543_0FC6FDD06212D6E0">
England, which they have long been u&s;ed to copy. For, previous to the late revolution, the Americans were taught from their infancy to look up to the Engli&s;h as the patterns of perfection in all things.</P>
<P>I have, however, ob&s;erved one cu&s;tom, which, for ought I know, is peculiar to this country. An account of it will &s;erve to fill up the remainder of this &s;heet, and may afford you &s;ome amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>WHEN a young couple are about to enter on the matrimonial &s;tate, a never failing article in the the marriage treaty is, that the lady &s;hall have and enjoy the free and unmole&s;ted exerci&s;e of the rights of WHITE-WASHING, with all its ceremonials, pri|vileges, and appurtenances. You will wonder what this privilege of <HI>white-wa&s;hing</HI> is. I will endea|vour to give you an idea of the ceremony, as I have &s;een it performed.</P>
<P>THERE is no &s;ea&s;on of the year in which the la|dy may not, if &s;he plea&s;es, claim her privilege; but the latter end of May is generally fixed upon for the purpo&s;e. The attentive hu&s;band may judge, by certain progno&s;tics, when the &s;torm is nigh at hand. If the lady grows uncommonly fretful, finds fault with the &s;ervants, is di&s;contented with the
<PB N="151" REF="024407_0544_0FC6FDD8029A1F58">
children, and complains much of the na&s;tine&s;s of every thing about her: the&s;e are &s;ymptoms which ought not to be neglected, yet they &s;ometimes go off without any further effect. But if, when the hu&s;band ri&s;es in the morning, he &s;hould ob&s;erve in the yard, a wheelbarrow, with a quantity of lime in it, or &s;hould &s;ee certain buckets filled with a &s;o|lution of lime in water, there is no time for he&s;ita|tion. He immediately locks up the apartment or clo&s;et where his papers, and private property are kept, and putting the key in his pocket, betakes him&s;elf to flight. A hu&s;band, however beloved, becomes a perfect nui&s;ance during this &s;ea&s;on of female rage. His authority is &s;uper&s;eded, his commi&s;&s;ion &s;u&s;pended, and the very &s;cullion who cleans the bra&s;&s;es in the kitchen becomes of more importance than him. He has nothing for it but to abdicate, for a time, and run from an evil which he can neither prevent nor molify.</P>
<P>THE hu&s;band gone, the ceremony begins. The walls are &s;tripped of their furniture&mdash;paintings, prints, and looking-gla&s;&s;es lie in huddled heaps about the floors; the curtains are torn from their te&s;ters, the beds crammed into windows, chairs and tables, bed&s;teads and cradles crowd the yard; and the garden fence bends beneath the weight of carpets, blankets, cloth cloaks, old coats, under

evacuated, the next operation is to &s;mear the walls and ceilings with bru&s;hes, dipped in a &s;o|lution of lime called WHITE-WASH; to pour buc|kets of water over every floor, and &s;cratch all the partitions and wain&s;coats with hard bru&s;hes, char|ged with &s;oft &s;oap and &s;tone-cutter's &s;and.</P>
<P>THE windows by no means e&s;cape the general deluge.

<P>I have been told that an action at law, was once brought again&s;t one of the&s;e water nymphs, by a per&s;on who had a new &s;uit of clothes &s;poiled by this operation: but after long argument it was deter|mined, that no damages could be awarded; ina&s;|much as the defendant was in the exerci&s;e of a le|gal right, and not an&s;werable for the con&s;equen|ces. And &s;o the poor gentleman was doubly non-&s;uited; for he lo&s;t both his &s;uit of clothes and his &s;uit at law.</P>
<P>THESE &s;mearings and &s;cratchings, the&s;e wa&s;hings and da&s;hings, being duly performed, the next cere|monial is to clean&s;e and replace the di&s;tracted fur|niture.

You may have &s;een a hou&s;e-rai&s;ing, or a &s;hip-launch&mdash;recollect, if you can, the hurry, bu&s;|tle, confu&s;ion, and noi&s;e of &s;uch a &s;cene, and you will have &s;ome idea of this clean&s;ing match. The misfortune is, that the &s;ole object is to make things <HI>clean.</HI> It matters not how many u&s;eful, ornamen|tal, or valuable articles &s;uffer mutilation or death under the operation. A mahogany chair and a carved frame undergo the &s;ame di&s;cipline: they are to be made <HI>clean</HI> at all events; but their pre|&s;ervation is not worthy of attention. For in&s;tance: a fine large engraving is laid flat upon the floor; a number of &s;maller prints are piled upon it, until the &s;uper-incumbent weight cracks the lower gla&s;s &mdash;but this is of no importance. A valuable pic|ture is placed leaning again&s;t the &s;harp corner of a table; others are made to lean again&s;t that, till the pre&s;&s;ure of the whole forces the corner of the table through the canvas of the fir&s;t. The frame and gla&s;s of a fine print are to be cleaned; the &s;pirit and oil u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion are &s;uffered to leak through and deface the engraving&mdash;no matter! If the gla&s;s is clean and the frame &s;hines it is &s;ufficient &mdash;the re&s;t is not worthy of con&s;ideration. An able arithmetician hath made a calculation, founded on long experience, and proved that the lo&s;&s;es and de|&s;truction incident to two white-wa&s;hings are equal
<PB N="155" REF="024407_0548_0FC6FDE5647A0340">
to one removal and three removals equal to one fire.</P>
<P>THIS clean&s;ing frolic over, matters begin to re|&s;ume their pri&s;tine appearance: the &s;torm abates, and all would be well again: but it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;o great a convul&s;ion in &s;o &s;mall a community &s;hould pa&s;s over without producing &s;ome con&s;e|quences. For two or three weeks after the ope|ration, the family are u&s;ually afflicted with &s;ore eyes, &s;ore throats, or &s;evere colds, occa&s;ioned by exhalations from wet floors and damp walls.</P>
<P>I know a gentleman here who is fond of ac|counting for every thing in a philo&s;ophical way. He con&s;iders this, which I call <HI>a cu&s;tom,</HI> as a real, periodical di&s;ea&s;e, peculiar to the climate.&mdash; His train of rea&s;oning is whim&s;ical and ingenious, but I am not at lea&s;ure to give you the detail. The re&s;ult was, that he found the di&s;temper to be incurable; but after much &s;tudy, he thought he had di&s;covered a method to divert the evil he could not &s;ubdue. For this purpo&s;e, he cau&s;ed a &s;mall building, about twelve feet &s;quare, to be erected in his garden, and furni&s;hed with &s;ome ordinary chairs and tables, and a few prints of the cheape&s;t &s;ort. His hope was, that when the white-wa&s;hing frenzy &s;eized the females of his fa|mily
<PB N="156" REF="024407_0549_0FC6FDE6E324DF38">
they might repair to this apartment, and &s;crub, and &s;cour, and &s;mear to their hearts con|tent; and &s;o &s;pend the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e in this out-po&s;t, whil&s;t he enjoyed him&s;elf in quiet at head-quarters. But the experiment did not an&s;wer his expectation. It was impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould, &s;ince a principal part of the gratification con&s;i&s;ts in the lady's having an uncontrolled right to tor|ment her hu&s;band, at lea&s;t once in every year&punc; to turn him out of doors, and take the reins of government into her own hands.</P>
<P>THERE is a much better contrivance than this of the philo&s;opher's: which is, to cover the walls of the hou&s;e with paper. This is gene|rally done. And though it does not aboli&s;h, it at lea&s;t &s;hortens the period of female dominion. This paper is decorated with various fancies, and made &s;o ornamental that the women have admitted the fa&s;hion without perceiving the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o another alleviation of the hu&s;|band's di&s;tre&s;s. He generally has the &s;ole u&s;e of a &s;mall room or clo&s;et for his books and papers, the key of which he is allowed to keep. This is con&s;idered as a privileged place, even in the white-wa&s;hing &s;ea&s;on, and &s;tands like the land of <HI>Go&s;hen</HI> amid&s;t the plagues of <HI>Egypt.</HI> But then he
<PB N="157" REF="024407_0550_0FC6FDED07466D40">
mu&s;t be extremely cautious, and ever upon his guard: for &s;hould he inadvertently go abroad, and leave the key in his door, the hou&s;e maid, who is always on the watch for &s;uch an oppor|tunity, immediately enters in triumph with buckets, brooms, and bru&s;hes&mdash;takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre|mi&s;es, and forthwith puts all his books and papers <HI>to rights,</HI> to his utter confu&s;ion, and &s;ometimes &s;e|rious detriment. I can give you an in&s;tance.</P>
<P>A gentleman was &s;ued at law, by the executors of a mechanic, on a charge found again&s;t him in the decea&s;ed's books to the amount of &pound; 30. The defendant was &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with a be|lief that he had di&s;charged the debt and taken a receipt; but as the tran&s;action was of long &s;tan|ding, he knew not where to find the receipt. The &s;uit went on in cour&s;e, and the time ap|proached when judgment &s;hould be obtained again&s;t him. He then &s;at down &s;eriou&s;ly to ex|amine a large bundle of old papers, which he had untied and di&s;played on a table for the pur|po&s;e. In the mid&s;t of his &s;earch he was &s;ud|denly called away on bu&s;ine&s;s of importance. He forgot to lock the door of his room. The hou&s;e maid who had been long looking for &s;uch a op|portunity, immediately entered with the u&s;ual implements, and with great alacrity fell to clean|ing
<PB N="158" REF="024407_0551_0FC6FDEF263D98B8">
the room and <HI>putting things to rights.</HI> One of the fir&s;t objects that &s;truck her eye was the confu&s;ed &s;ituation of the papers on the table. The&s;e, without delay, &s;he hudled together like &s;o many dirty knives and forks; but in the action a &s;mall piece of paper fell unnoticed on the floor, which unfortunately happened to be the very receipt in que&s;tion. As it had no very re&s;pec|table appearance, it was &s;oon after &s;wept out with the common dirt of the room, and carried in a du&s;t pan to the yard. The trade&s;man had neg|lected to enter the credit in his book. The de|fendant could find nothing to obviate the charge, and &s;o judgment went again&s;t him for debt and co&s;ts. A fortnight after the whole was &s;et|tled, and the money paid, one of the children found the receipt among&s;t the dirt in the yard.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o another cu&s;tom, peculiar to the city of Philadelphia, and nearly allied with the former. I mean that of wa&s;hing the pavements before the doors every Saturday evening. I at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed this to be a regulation of the po|lice; but, on further enquiry, I find it is a religi|ous rite preparatory to the Sabbath: and it is, I believe, the only religious rite in which the nume|rous &s;ectaries of this large city perfectly agree. The ceremony begins about &s;un&s;et and continues
<PB N="159" REF="024407_0552_0FC6FDF0E558B310">
till ten or eleven at night. It is very difficult for a &s;tranger to walk the &s;treets on tho&s;e eve|nings. He runs a continual ri&s;k of having a a bucket of dirty water da&s;hed again&s;t his legs; but a Philadelphian born is &s;o much accu&s;tomed to the danger that he avoids it with &s;urpri&s;ing dexterity. It is from this circum&s;tance that a Philadelphian may be known any where by a certain &s;kip in his gait. The &s;treets of New York are paved with rough &s;tones. The&s;e, in|deed, are not wa&s;hed, but the dirt is &s;o tho|roughly &s;wept from between them that they &s;tand up &s;harp and prominent, to the great annoyance of tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tomed to &s;o rough a path. But habit reconciles every thing. It is diverting enough to &s;ee a Philadelphian at New York. He walks the &s;treet with as much painful caution as if his toes were covered with corns, or his feet lamed by the gout: whil&s;t a New York|er, as little approving the plain ma&s;onry of Phi|ladelphia, &s;huffles along the pavement like a parrot upon a mahogany table.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledged that the ablutions I have mentioned are attended with no &s;mall incon|venience; yet the women would not be induced by con&s;ideration to re&s;ign their privilege.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="024407_0553_0FC6FDF3A258C538">NOTWITHSTANDING this &s;ingularity, I can give you the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances that the women of A|merica make the mo&s;t faithful wives, and the mo&s;t attentive mothers in the world. And I don't doubt but you will join me in opinion, that if a married man is made mi&s;erable only for one week in a whole year, he will have no great cau&s;e to com|plain of the matrimonial bond.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;een a piece in the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania Pack|et,</HI> and republi&s;hed in <HI>Mr. Carey's</HI> Mu&s;eum, upon the cu&s;tom of <HI>White-wa&s;hing,</HI> in which that ne|ce&s;&s;ary duty of a good hou&s;e-wife is treated with unmerited ridicule. I &s;hould probably have for|got the fooli&s;h thing; but the &s;ea&s;on approaching, which mo&s;t women think &s;uitable for clean&s;ing their apartments of the &s;moke and dirt of the winter, I hear this &s;aucy author di&s;hed up in eve|ry family, and his flippant performance quoted whenever a wife attempts to exerci&s;e her rea|&s;onable prerogative or execute the duties of her &s;tation.</P>
<P>WOMEN generally employ their time to better purpo&s;e than in &s;cribbling. The care and comforts of a family re&s;t principally on their
<PB N="162" REF="024407_0555_0FC6FDFF920CAAA0">
&s;houlders. Hence it is that there are but few famale authors; and the men, knowing how nece&s;|&s;ary our attentions are to their happine&s;s, take every opportunity of di&s;couraging literary accom|pli&s;hments in the fair &s;ex. We hear it echo'd from every quarter&mdash;
<Q>My wife cannot make ver&s;es, it is true; but &s;he makes an excellent pudding&mdash;She can't correct the pre&s;s; but &s;he can correct her children, and &s;cold her &s;ervants with admirable di&s;cretion&mdash;&s;he can't unravel t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> intricacies of political oeconomy and federal go|vernment; but &s;he can knit charming &s;tock|ings.</Q>
And this they call prai&s;ing a wife, and doing ju&s;tice to her good character.</P>
<P>I &s;ay women generally employ their time to bet|ter purpo&s;e than in &s;cribbling; otherwi&s;e this face|tious writer had not e&s;caped &s;o long unan&s;wered. We have ladies who &s;ometimes lay down the needle and take up the pen; I wonder none of them have attempted &s;ome reply. For my part I do not pretend to be an author: I never ap|peared in print in my life, but I can no longer forbear &s;aying &s;omething in an&s;wer to &s;uch imper|tinence.</P>
<P>ONLY con&s;ider, Mr. Editor, our &s;ituation. Men are naturally inattentive to the decencies of
<PB N="163" REF="024407_0556_0FC6FE0075556D58">
life; but why &s;hould I be &s;o complai&s;ant? I &s;ay they are naturally na&s;ty bea&s;ts. If it were not that their connection with the refined &s;ex poli&s;hed their manners, and had a happy influence on the general oeconomy of life, the&s;e lords of the crea|tion would wallow in filth, and populous cities would infect the atmo&s;phere with their noxious va|pours. It is the attention and a&s;&s;iduity of the women that prevent men from degenerating into &s;wine.</P>
<P>HOW important, then, are the &s;ervices we ren|der! And yet for the&s;e very &s;ervices we are made the &s;ubject of ridicule and fun&mdash;Ba&s;e ingratitude! nau&s;eous creatures! Perhaps you may think I am in a pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;No, Mr. Editor, I do a&s;&s;ure you I was never more compo&s;ed in my life; and yet it is enough to provoke a &s;aint to &s;ee how un|rea&s;onably we are treated by the men&mdash;Why, now, there's my hu&s;band, a good enough &s;ort of a man in the main, but I will give you a &s;mall &s;am|ple of him. He comes into the parlour, the other day, where, to be &s;ure, I was cutting up a piece of linen. "Lord, &s;ays he, what a clutter here is &mdash;I cannot bear to &s;ee the parlour look like a tay|lor's &s;hop&mdash;be&s;ides, I am going to make &s;ome im|portant philo&s;ophical experiments, and mu&s;t have &s;ufficient room." You mu&s;t know my hu&s;band is
<PB N="164" REF="024407_0557_0FC6FE03973A9050">
one of your would-be philo&s;ophers. Well&mdash;I bundled up my linen as quick as I could, and be|gan to darn a pair of ruffles, which took up no room, and could give no offence. I was determin|ed, however, to watch my lord and ma&s;ter's impor|tant bu&s;ine&s;s. In about half an hour the tables were covered with all manner of trumpery&mdash;bottles of water, phials of drugs, pa&s;teboard, paper and cards, glue, pa&s;te and gum-arabic, files, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars and needles, ro&s;in, wax, &s;ilk, thread, rags, jags, tags, books, pamphlets and manu&s;cripts.&mdash; Lord ble&s;s me! I am almo&s;t out of breath, and yet I have not enumerated half the articles. Well! to work he went, and although I did not under|&s;tand the object of his manoeuvres, yet I could &s;uf|ficiently di&s;cover that he did not &s;ucceed in any one operation: I was glad of that&mdash;yes, I confe&s;s, I was glad of that, and good rea&s;on too. After he had fatigued him&s;elf with mi&s;chief, like a monkey in a china &s;hop, and had called the &s;ervants to clear every thing away, I took a view of the &s;cene be|fore me. I &s;hall not even attempt a minute de|&s;cription&mdash;&s;uffice it to &s;ay, that he had over&s;et his ink&s;tand, and &s;tained my be&s;t mahogany table with ink; he had &s;pilt a quantity of vitriol upon my carpet, and burned a hole in it; my marble hearth was all over &s;potted with melted ro&s;in; he had bro|ken
<PB N="165" REF="024407_0558_0FC6FE05FA1965D8">
three china cups, two wine gla&s;&s;es, a tumbler, and one of my be&s;t d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nters; and after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, as I &s;aid before, I perceived that he had not &s;ucceeded in any one operation.

I &s;ay, I took a &s;ober view of the dirt and deva&s;tation my philo&s;ophical hu&s;band had made; and there I &s;at, <HI>like patience on a monument, &s;miling at grief;</HI> but it worked in|wardly&mdash;yes, Mr Editor, it worked inwardly, I would almo&s;t as lieve the melted ro&s;in had been in his throat, and the vitriol upon his &s;kin, as on my dear marble hearth and my carpet. It is not true that women have no command over their own feelings; for not with&s;tanding this gro&s;s provo|cation I &s;aid nothing, or next to nothing; I only ob&s;erved, very plea&s;antly, that a lady of my acquaintance had told me, that the rea&s;on why philo&s;ophers are called <HI>literary</HI> men, is becau&s;e they frequently make a great <HI>litter</HI>&mdash;not a word more&mdash;However, the &s;ervant cleared away, and down &s;at the di&s;appointed philo&s;opher. A friend dropt in &s;oon after&mdash;"Your &s;ervant Sir,&mdash;how do you do?" "Oh Lord! I am almo&s;t fatigued

to death&mdash;I have been all the morning making philo&s;ophical experiments." I was now more hardly put to it to &s;mother a laugh, than I had been ju&s;t before to contain my re&s;entment. My <HI>precious</HI> went out &s;oon after with his friend&mdash;And I, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, immediately mu&s;tered all my forces&mdash;bru&s;hes, buckets, &s;oap, &s;and, lime-&s;kins, and cocoa-nut &s;hells&mdash;all the pow|ers of hou&s;e-wifery were employed.

<P>THIS operation was &s;carce over, when in came my <HI>experimental dear,</HI> and told me with all the in|difference in the world, that he had invited &s;ix gentlemen to dine with him at three o'clock&mdash;it was then pa&s;t one&mdash;I complained of the &s;hort no|tice&mdash;"Poh! Poh! &s;ays he, you can get a leg of mutton, and a loin of veal, and a few potatoes, and it will do well enough&mdash;Heaven's! what a chaos mu&s;t the head of a philo&s;opher be!&mdash;A leg of mutton, a loin of veal and potatoes! I was at a lo&s;s whether I &s;hould laugh or be angry.
<PB N="167" REF="024407_0560_0FC6FE108371AB08">
But there was no time for determining&mdash;I had but an hour and a half to do a world of bu&s;ine&s;s in. My carpet, which had &s;uffered in the cau&s;e of ex|perimental philo&s;ophy in the morning, was de&s;tined to be &s;hamefully di&s;honoured in the afternoon by a deluge of filthy tobacco juice&mdash;Gentlemen &s;mokers and chewers, love &s;egars and pigtail bet|ter than carpets.</P>
<P>THINK, Mr Editor, what a woman mu&s;t endure under &s;uch circum&s;tances; and then, after all to be reproached with her cleanline&s;s, and to have her white-wa&s;hings, her &s;cowrings and &s;crubbings made the &s;ubject of public ridicule, is more than patience can put up with.</P>
<P>WHAT I have now exhibited is but a &s;mall &s;pe|cimen of the injuries we &s;uffer under the boa&s;ted &s;uperiority of the men. But we will not be laughed out of our cleanline&s;s.

<P>WHETHER it is owing to &s;ome &s;olitary hours I pa&s;s in my &s;ubterraneous &s;hop, or to the overflow|ings of a large accumulation of ideas, acquired in a life of travel and adventures; or that the in|ce&s;&s;ant motion of my elbows, nece&s;&s;ary in my oc|cupation, which, for rea&s;ons unknown, may irritate and provoke the mind to di&s;charge its contents, as the motion of a &s;hip operates upon the &s;to|machs, or that by &s;ome &s;ecret influence of the phi|lo&s;ophical walls that &s;urround me I am induced,

this rea&s;onable expectation in as few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> I can.</P>
<P>I was born in an ob&s;cure village in England. My father could neither read nor write, but had a mo&s;t profound veneration for men of genius and learning. He carried this blind pa&s;&s;ion &s;o far, that he was frequently the &s;ubject of ridicule; and &s;ometimes &s;uffered real lo&s;s by &s;harpers who impo&s;ed them&s;elves upon him for &s;cholars, and authors neglected by the ungrateful world, or men of genius, on the point of producing the mo&s;t important di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>MY father re&s;olved to do better by me than his father had done by him; and therefore put me to a charity-&s;chool as &s;oon as I was eight years old. After two years cruel per&s;ecution, I was whipped through the &s;pelling-book as far as words of five &s;yllables. It took me three months and a half to &s;pell the word <HI>liberality;</HI> in which time I received 97 &s;trokes of the ferule on my right hand, and 53 on my left; 8 times I wore the dunce's cap; and 5 times publicly whipt. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I received one hundred and thirteen &s;tripes with a rattan acro&s;s my &s;houlders, and &s;uffered two hundred and twenty five pinches of my right ear. At la&s;t I could &s;pell the word <HI>liberality.</HI>
<PB N="172" REF="024407_0565_0FC6FE216E43B448">
But being no longer able to bear this cruel di&s;ci|pline, I took to my heels and ran off.</P>
<P>I was running enough to elude the &s;earch my father made for me for two years, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by hiring my&s;elf occa&s;ionally as a &s;ervant. At la&s;t, I offered my&s;elf to a farmer, who had &s;een an adver|ti&s;ement an&s;wering my de&s;cription. He &s;ecured me, and &s;ent me back to my father, who loaded me with reproaches and abu&s;e. He gave overall expectation of making me a &s;cholar, and fixing his hopes upon my brother <HI>Dick,</HI> bound me ap|prentice to a &s;hoemaker.</P>
<P>I was almo&s;t as un&s;ucce&s;sful here as at the free-&s;chool. I acquired a tolerable knack at botching and patching, but could never arrive at the &s;kill of making a whole &s;hoe.</P>
<P>AFTER I had in vain tried for four years to make my&s;elf ma&s;ter of the bu&s;ine&s;s, I conceived a thorough di&s;like to the trade, and throwing down my &s;trap and la&s;t, I once more threw my&s;elf into the hands of fortune.</P>
<P>My father died &s;oon after, and my mother did not think me worth enquiring after.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="024407_0566_0FC6FE2854A0BB30">I went through various &s;cenes of employ for &s;e|ven years: In which time I had great opportu|nities of making ob&s;ervations on men and manners. I contracted many prejudices; I &s;tored up many opinions, and learned many words: but the word <HI>liberality</HI> was never out of my mind; it had been impre&s;&s;ed on my memory, and, I may &s;ay, engraved on my fle&s;h.</P>
<P>AT length I engaged in the &s;ervice of a man very famous in the learned world; a celebrated author in theology and natural philo&s;ophy. I lived with him many years. I adopted all his prin|ciples, not becau&s;e I under&s;tood them, but becau&s;e I lived with him, and they were his principles, and becau&s;e I derived no &s;mall credit from this connection; as the moon is admired for the light &s;he affords, not that &s;he is luminous in her&s;elf, but becau&s;e &s;he is within the influence of the &s;un's rays. I was more than the &s;ervant, I was the companion of this great man; and as the multi|tude are apt to think that knowledge may be taken, like the itch or &s;mall-pox, by contagion, I acquired a con&s;iderable literary reputation among&s;t illiterate men. I turned the electric wheel for my patron; I kindled his fire; I brought him water; I handed him books from the &s;helves, and bottles from the clo&s;et; and &s;o I became a <HI>philo&s;opher.</HI> Moreover,
<PB N="174" REF="024407_0567_0FC6FE29A2D90158">
I carried his manu&s;cripts to the printer, and brought back the printed &s;heets for correction; and &s;o I became a <HI>theologi&s;t.</HI> It is true, I was of|ten unlucky in my zeal to &s;erve him; I inadvert|ently di&s;charged his accumulated electricity; I cracked his jars, and broke his bottles; I burned his clothes with vitriol, and his fle&s;h with aqua|fortis; and frequently &s;tumbled in my way to the printer's, and plunged his manu&s;cript in the ken|nel. But he was a <HI>philo&s;opher,</HI> and bore all with patience.</P>
<P>STILL the word <HI>liberality</HI> pre&s;&s;ed upon my mind. My ma&s;ter and I differed in opinion about dephlogi&s;ticated air: I thought he was very <HI>illi|beral;</HI>
and &s;o we parted, and I determined to tra|vel far and near in &s;earch of true <HI>liberality.</HI></P>
<P>I ran through mo&s;t of the countries in Europe, in hopes of finding this precious jewel. But, alas! to no purpo&s;e. In <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> they be|lieve in tran&s;ub&s;tantiation and the pope's infallibi|lity, and the people of <HI>France</HI> believe in nothing at all; of cour&s;e there could be no <HI>liberality</HI> in tho&s;e countries. In <HI>Italy,</HI> they prefer the philo|&s;ophy of <HI>Ingenhouzen,</HI> to that of my ma&s;ter and friend; this I thought very <HI>illiberal,</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing our difference. In <HI>Geneva,</HI> they believe in
<PB N="175" REF="024407_0568_0FC6FE2DDE609C80">
prede&s;tination, a doctrine I abhor: and in <HI>Swit|zerland,</HI> the citizens make a practice of hiring them&s;elves as &s;oldiers to foreign princes.</P>
<P>I once thought I &s;hould find what I was in &s;earch of, among&s;t the rude but uncorrupted inhabitants of the <HI>Alps</HI>: but after &s;ojourning with them many days, I di&s;covered that they e&s;teemed the large <HI>wens</HI> which mo&s;t of them had hanging to their chins as very ornamental, for my part I thought them extremely ugly, and &s;o I concluded, that there could be no <HI>liberality</HI> on the <HI>Alps.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be a u&s;ele&s;s ta&s;k to enumerate all the particulars in which the people of every nation differed from me in opinion, and di&s;appointed me in the object of my pur&s;uit. True genuine <HI>libe|rality</HI>
was not to be found among&s;t them.</P>
<P>AT length I returned to England. Here I found things wor&s;e than ever. My friend's <HI>the|ology</HI>
was publicly conte&s;ted, and &s;ome of his doc|trines even reprobated. Not only this, but the nation was engaged in a war with the people of America, on principles which I could not approve. Convinced, that there was no <HI>liberality</HI> in England&punc; I determined to cro&s;s the Atlantic, and &s;eek for it in America.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="024407_0569_0FC6FE308D60B2A8">ON my arrival in this country, I was much cha|grined to find that the doctrine of the Trinity was generally received and profe&s;&s;ed; a doctrine a|gain&s;t which I had acquired the &s;tronge&s;t antipa|thy from my ma&s;ter, the great philo&s;opher. How|ever, as war raged in the country, there was no time for theological di&s;qui&s;itions; and as the ju&s;|tice of the war was clearly on the &s;ide of the Americans, I re&s;olved to take an active part in their cau&s;e, and enli&s;ted my&s;elf a &s;oldier in the Penn&s;ylvania line. I went through inexpre&s;&s;ible toil and danger, in marches, counter-marches, &s;kirmi&s;hes and battles, and was finally wounded at the &s;iege of <HI>York-Town,</HI> when lord Cornwallis and his army &s;urrendered to the allied forces of France and America.</P>
<P>After the peace, I &s;upported my&s;elf by cobling and patching, and employed my lei&s;ure hours in combating the doctrine of the Trinity, and devi&s;ing grand &s;chemes <HI>for public utility.</HI></P>
<P>AT length government thought fit to e&s;tabli&s;h a corps of invalids, and &s;itted up the ea&s;t wing of the &s;tate-hou&s;e for their accommodation, and I now belong to this corps. As we have no great deal to do, our duty being very &s;light, I have &s;pent much time in watching the progre&s;s of a

building near our quarters, intended as a hall for the Philo&s;ophical Society. Although it is not quite a year &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;tone was laid, the cel|lar is already completed; but <HI>when</HI> the roof will be rai&s;ed, can be known only to men of profound erudition and nice calculation&mdash;to fini&s;h my hi&s;to|ry, of which but little now remains&mdash;</P>
<P>As I &s;tood looking on, whil&s;t the labourers were digging this philo&s;ophical cellar, I took particular notice of the &s;everal <HI>&s;tratums</HI> of loam, &s;and and gra|as they appeared. I procured &s;amples of each, and &s;ubmitting them to <HI>hyper&s;tratical</HI> experiments, I found that they were all of different <HI>pacific</HI> gravi|ties. This extraordinary circum&s;tance &s;trongly prejudiced me in favour of the &s;ociety and their propo&s;ed hall, and I concluded that I &s;hould cer|tainly find <HI>true liberality</HI> in the bottom of this &s;ci|entific cellar.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was completed, and covered with rough boards, I conveyed my bench and cobling tools to this &s;ubterraneous temple of Minerva. And here I may be &s;een daily toiling for <HI>public utility</HI> in the double capacity of cobler and author.</P>
<P>MY &s;ituation, &s;o contiguous to the &s;eat of le|gi&s;lation and other offices of &s;tate, has made me of
<PB N="178" REF="024407_0571_0FC6FE36E39A2E78">
no &s;mall u&s;e in the commonwealth. And the truth is, that I am now <HI>oppre&s;t with public bu&s;ine&s;s</HI>&mdash;I have heeltaped coun&s;ellors; patched the upper leather of judges; examined the <HI>&s;oles</HI> of a&s;&s;embly men, and given &s;ome of them better <HI>under&s;tandings.</HI></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING that the care of the &s;tate is thus daily pre&s;&s;ing upon me, I enjoy good health, owing to the <HI>&s;allibrity</HI> of my philo&s;ophical work-&s;hop: for, it is &s;o ingeniou&s;ly con&s;tructed, that the <HI>atmo&s;pheric</HI> air is compelled to de&s;cend and di&s;place the <HI>memphitic</HI> air common in cellars and confined places.</P>
<P>FROM this profound habitation I &s;hall date my future e&s;&s;ays, and expect that my performances will procure me no &s;mall credit with the public, if the people have any <HI>liberality.</HI></P>

<P>&rindx;A warm di&s;pute had taken place between <HI>Mr. Moore,</HI> a mer|chant, and <HI>Mr. Lewis,</HI> a lawyer. The parties attacked each other with great acrimony in the public papers; and the conte&s;t drew in friends on both &s;ides, who &s;oon became principals in the quarrel.

The parties forgave each other &s;ooner than they forgave the author.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>FOR THE PENNSYLVANIA PACKET.</HEAD>
<P>I Mentioned in a former e&s;&s;ay that my greate&s;t ambition is to become famous by the invention of &s;ome ingenious or u&s;eful project which &s;hall be generally approved and adopted. At the &s;ame time I communicated to the public, a device, which, from its novelty and convenience, I thought could not fail of &s;ucce&s;s. In vain, however, have I looked for that applau&s;e which I &s;till think ju&s;tly due to the fruit of genius, ripened by the labours
<PB N="180" REF="024407_0573_0FC6FE3D6D509600">
of the under&s;tanding. The author and his con|trivance are no more thought of.</P>
<P>I have at different times, publi&s;hed &s;everal other devices of rare invention, which have all found the &s;ame fate. Whether the fault lies with me, or with the public, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to &s;ay; but as my love of fame is invincible, I &s;hall go on projecting and contriving in hopes &s;ome lucky hit may accompli&s;h my purpo&s;e, by procuring me the honour I &s;o ardently de&s;ire.</P>
<P>As I am now growing old in the bu&s;ine&s;s, ex|perience and frequent di&s;appointments have taught me to be le&s;s &s;anguine in my expectations; and, like other authors, to depend more on a for|tuitous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public caprice than on the intrin&s;ic merits of my own performance.</P>
<P>MY pre&s;ent de&s;ign, which I offer with great mode&s;ty, re&s;pects an improvement in the art of <HI>printing;</HI> and is a device to ender it not only expre&s;&s;ive of an author's narrative, opinions, or ar|guments; but al&s;o of the peculiarities of his tem|per and the vivacity of his feelings.</P>
<P>As I have as due a regard to literary hone&s;ty as to any other kind of hone&s;ty, I candidly confe&s;s
<PB N="181" REF="024407_0574_0FC6FE3EA6F3F450">
that I took the hint from an ingenious work of a <HI>Mr. Steele</HI> of London, who has contrived and publi&s;hed a &s;cheme for noting down, in certain mu&s;ical characters, the ri&s;ings, fallings, and various inflections of the voice in common conver&s;ation or in public &s;peaking. So that not only the matter of an oration, but even the <HI>manner</HI> of the orator may be &s;ecured and tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>MY contrivance has this advantage over his, that no new characters are nece&s;&s;ary to it. Tho&s;e commonly u&s;ed in printing are &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. Be&s;ides, his project is only calculated to a&s;certain the <HI>fortes</HI> and <HI>pianos,</HI> and various <HI>&s;lides</HI> of the human voice in &s;peaking; whereas mine is contrived to de&s;ignate the <HI>fortes</HI> and <HI>pianos,</HI> and various <HI>&s;lides</HI> of the temper in writing.</P>
<P>MY &s;y&s;tem is founded in a practice which na|ture her&s;elf dictates, and which every one mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, I mean that of elevating the voice in proportion to the agitation of mind, or ear|ne&s;tne&s;s of the &s;peaker. Thus a reprimand is given in a higher tone than admonition: and a per&s;on in a fright or in pa&s;&s;ion, exerts his lungs according to the <HI>quantum</HI> of terror or rage with which he is affected.</P>
<P>NOW I would have the degrees of vociferation
<PB N="182" REF="024407_0575_0FC6FE40566D60F8">
&mdash;&s;uch as <HI>piani&s;&s;imo, piano, forte, forti&s;&s;imo,</HI> with all the intermediate gradations de&s;ignated by the &s;ize of the letters which compo&s;e the emphatic words. And for this the various &s;pecies of types from  <GAP DESC="blank">  Pearl  <GAP DESC="blank">  up to Five Line Pica, will afford an ample &s;cale.</P>
<P>THE ingenious authors of adverti&s;ements have I confe&s;s, in &s;ome &s;ort anticipated my de&s;ign. We often &s;ee.</P>
<P><HI>&s;top thief! &s;top thief!</HI> bawled out in double Pica Italics. The name of

<P>AND as a further enforcement to attention, I have &s;een the figure of a hand, with a crier's bell in the act of ringing, adverti&s;ing an auction of hou&s;ehold furniture. Every one &s;triving to be heard in preference by a &s;uperior magnitude of types. At pre&s;ent there are none who roar out in louder, or blacker characters, than the printers them&s;elves for Rags.</P>
<P>THERE is no looking at the fir&s;t page of the daily adverti&s;er without imagining a number of people hallowing and bawling to you to buy their goods or lands, to charter their &s;hips, or to in|form you that a &s;ervant or a hor&s;e hath &s;trayed a|way. For my part I am &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this idea, that as &s;oon as I take up the paper of the day, I turn over to articles of Intelligence as quick as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t my eyes &s;hould be &s;tunned by the

<HI>occular uproar</HI> of the fir&s;t page. For I am a peaceable man, and hate nothing more than the confu&s;ed noi&s;e of a mob.</P>
<P>MY project, then, con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the prin|ter in compo&s;ing any work &s;hould adapt the &s;ize of his types to the &s;pirit of his author, &s;o that a reader may become, in &s;ome degree per&s;onally acquainted with a writer whil&s;t he is peru&s;ing his work. Thus an author of cool and equable &s;pi|rits might take Bourgeois Roman for his medium, and would probably never ri&s;e higher than Great Primer; whil&s;t a pa&s;&s;ionate man, engaged in a warm con|trover&s;y, might thunder away in French Canon.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="024407_0578_0FC6FE4CE3D03298">IT follows of cour&s;e that authors of great vi|gour, &s;hould be charged higher than meek writers for printing a work of the &s;ame length, on account of the extraordinary &s;pace their per|formances mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occupy; for the&s;e gi|gantic, wrathful types, like ranters on a &s;tage, or Burgoyne at Saratoga, will demand &s;ufficient elbow room.</P>

For what, alas! are a few <HI>Capitals</HI> and <HI>Italies</HI> in the hands of a vigorous author? and yet the&s;e are the only typographical emphatics now in u&s;e.

<P>I Informed you in my la&s;t of the rout I took to arrive at this great city. I de&s;cribed as well as I could, the places I pa&s;&s;ed through; the manners of the people; the incidents that occurred; and the impo&s;itions to which I was obliged to &s;ubmit.

<P>WELL&mdash;here I am, and here I have been &s;ince the beginning of December la&s;t. I have &s;everal times attempted to continue my narrative and opi|nions for your entertainment, according to promi&s;e, but could not find my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to &s;it long enough for the purpo&s;e. At pre&s;ent I am nece&s;&s;arily con|fined by a &s;evere cold; and to this indi&s;po&s;ition you are indebted for the letter I am now going to write. You will &s;incerely wi&s;h me better health, when you &s;hall know the dulne&s;s of the &s;ubject I have undertaken.</P>
<P>YOU will rea&s;onably expect &s;ome account of the polite amu&s;ements of this metropolis&mdash;the manners and ta&s;te of the fa&s;hionable world&mdash;their theatres, concerts, R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">elagh, Pantheon, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But no; I will give you the&s;e &s;ome other time. At pre&s;ent I have a very different object in view, which has happened to engage much of my atten|tion; and, as I always &s;it down to write what I think, not to think what I &s;hall write, I mu&s;t take the &s;ubject which impre&s;&s;es my mind at the time, or not write at all.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="024407_0589_0FC6F91E0DC3C5F0">THE great que&s;tion&mdash;"<HI>What is the be&s;t form of government?</HI>" &s;eems as far from being determined as ever; the politicians of different nations not having come to any compromi&s;e on this important &s;ubject. The rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e is, becau&s;e no form of government can be devi&s;ed that &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily involve in it&s;elf the happine&s;s or unhappine&s;s of the people. There is, in fact, no mechanical affinity between the&s;e two objects. The multitude are happy or not, according to their ideas of the go|vernment by which they are re&s;trained; and the&s;e ideas are not the produce of &s;peculative knowledge, but are derived from the prejudices of education: whil&s;t the more enlightened judge of government by the manner in which its powers are exerci&s;ed and ju&s;tice admini&s;tered. So that in&s;tead of deter|mining on the happine&s;s of a people by the nature of their political con&s;titution, we &s;hould rever&s;e the po&s;ition, and judge of their political con&s;tituti|on by its effects on the people; or, in other words, that is the be&s;t government which is be&s;t admini|&s;tered. This truth &s;eems to be generally admitted by writers on the &s;ubject. The pur&s;uit now, is not for a form of government that &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily and mechanically make the people mo&s;t happy; but for &s;uch a con&s;titution as may be mo&s;t effectual in &s;ecuring them from being made mi&s;erable.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="024407_0590_0FC6F91F0DA360F8"><HI>GREAT-BRITAIN</HI> is, I believe, the only nation that hath fairly tried the experiment. All other governments, that I know of, have certain de&s;ig|nated characters: they are either de&s;potic, monar|chical, ari&s;tocratical, or democratical. But the Engli&s;h con&s;titution is none of the&s;e, and yet par|takes of the nature of each. Their writers tell us, that by mixing the forms, they enjoy all their re|&s;pective advantages, and that they reciprocally check each other, &s;o as to counteract all their pe|culiar dangers and inconveniences.</P>
<P>ALL this is made very clear in theory; but if we attend to facts, we &s;hall find that the &s;cheme does not fully an&s;wer the great purpo&s;es it &s;eems to promi&s;e. Their hi&s;tory is a proof; wherein we &s;ee perpetual &s;truggles between the crown and the people for encroachments of power on the one hand, or an exten&s;ion of privileges on the other: and their annual publications, and frequent changes of men in office, in modern as well as ancient times, &s;hew them to be &s;ubject to all the evils of faction and in&s;tability. The truth is, that &s;o nice an ad|ju&s;tment of &s;o complicated a machine&mdash;&s;uch a due proportion of &s;trength in the component parts that they &s;hall not interfere with or impede each other &mdash;&s;uch an accurate di&s;po&s;ition of heterogeneous powers, that each &s;hall naturally find out its own

<P>DON'T be alarmed: I am not going to di&s;cu&s;s this intricate &s;ubject at large; I wonder how I got &s;o far into it: I have neither lei&s;ure, inclination, or ability to pur&s;ue it. I had fixed my attention only on one particular part of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, on which I mean to give you my &s;entiments; and re&s;pecting this, I have been for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t making a&s;&s;iduous and minute enquiries&mdash;I mean the <HI>admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice by grand and petit juries.</HI></P>

<P><HI>GRAND JURIES</HI> are only made u&s;e of in ca&s;es of criminal proce&s;s, or public offence; <HI>petit juries</HI> in all ca&s;es of trial, whether for a breach of the laws, for private wrongs, or property in di&s;pute. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are &s;ome &s;pecies of trials in England, where juries are not concerned; but it is not nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate them here, as my pre&s;ent object is only the trial by juries.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE &s;heriff of the county or di&s;trict, in pur&s;u|ance

of a writ directed to him by the judges, makes out a li&s;t of 24 hone&s;t and &s;ub&s;tantial free-holders, that is men of character, who po&s;&s;e&s;s a real or land|ed e&s;tate in the county. To each of the&s;e he &s;ends a written or printed notice to attend the court on a certain day. If the &s;heriff does his duty, the&s;e ought to be men mo&s;t re&s;pectable for property, in|tegrity, and abilities; &s;o that poverty may not in|duce them to a corrupt abu&s;e of their office, or ig|norance lead them to an ab&s;urd exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>NOT le&s;s than twelve, or more than twenty-three, are competent to the formation of a grand jury. Generally from fifteen to eighteen are con&s;idered as a &s;uitable number.</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e are convened in court, the oath of office is admini&s;tered to them, which is a very &s;trict one. They &s;wear that they will not accu&s;e any per&s;on for hatred or malice; or &s;uffer any of|fender to e&s;cape unaccu&s;ed from any favour or af|fection, or hope of reward. Thus qualified they retire to any apartment they plea&s;e to perform the duty the law hath a&s;&s;igned to them.</P>
<P>THEY are called the <HI>grand inque&s;t</HI> for the coun|ty: becau&s;e it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire of all of|fences that may have been committed within that
<PB N="200" REF="024407_0593_0FC6F9237425DA80">
di&s;trict, and pre&s;ent them to the notice of the court. They are to receive information from every &s;ource; but particularly from the officer called the <HI>king's attorney,</HI> or the pro&s;ecutor in behalf of government. The bills of accu&s;ation are all framed by this offi|cer, who &s;ends them to the grand jury for enquiry, together with the witne&s;&s;es in &s;upport of the bills.</P>
<P>THE jury then proceed to make a careful inve&s;|tigation of the charge, to examine the witne&s;&s;es, and con&s;ider the whole matter in a large and liberal view; but the accu&s;ed per&s;on is not &s;uffered to ap|pear and make his defence, this not being the time a&s;&s;igned for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IF the grand jury, or a majority of them, find &s;uf|ficient cau&s;e to believe that the party is guilty of the crimes alledged again&s;t him, their foreman, in behalf of the whole body, endor&s;es on the bill <HI>billa vera,</HI> or <HI>a true bill;</HI> if otherwi&s;e, he endor&s;es the word <HI>ignoramus,</HI> as much as to &s;ay, this charge may be true, but we do not know that it is &s;o. The rejection of a bill by the grand jury does not operate as an acquittal; for the party may be again indicted for the &s;ame offence, if fuller te&s;timony in &s;upport of the accu&s;ation can afterwards be pro|cured.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="024407_0594_0FC6F928F8A94B78">THE bills, thus endor&s;ed, are brought into court and delivered to the judges. The party again&s;t whom the bill is found (as it is called) mu&s;t be then &s;ent for, and per&s;onally appear in court. If this cannot be done, the trial mu&s;t be put off till he can be taken and brought to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>WHEN the accu&s;ed per&s;on appears, the bill, now called an <HI>indictment,</HI> is di&s;tinctly read to him by the clerk of the court, who peremptorily demands of him whether he is <HI>guilty</HI> or <HI>not guilty</HI> of the charge as laid in the indictment. If the party ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;es to an&s;wer, the court cannot, according to the &s;trict rules of common law, proceed again&s;t him; becau&s;e he does not voluntarily &s;ubmit his cau&s;e to that juri&s;diction, by a&s;&s;enting to or denying the ac|cu&s;ation: for the law does not allow that any court hath an official power to determine on a man's life or property, unle&s;s by his own act he con&s;ents, or &s;eems to con&s;ent, to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to its juri&s;dicti|on; and this is &s;uppo&s;ed to be done by his enter|ing his plea, that is, by acknowledging or denying the charge brought again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THERE have been in&s;tances in former times of per&s;ons &s;tanding <HI>mute,</HI> and refu&s;ing to plead to the indictment; to remedy which, a mo&s;t ab&s;urd and barbarous practice was admitted to enforce an an|&s;wer.
<PB N="202" REF="024407_0595_0FC6F92BB42ED360">
The party was taken to pri&s;on, and laid upon his back, naked, on the floor of a dungeon, his arms and legs were tied by four cords to the four corners of the dungeon: he was &s;paringly fed with the mo&s;t coar&s;e and ordinary bread that could be got, and drink brought him from the neare&s;t ken|nel; a weight was al&s;o laid upon his brea&s;t, and a like weight daily added, until, by his intolerable &s;ituation, he was compelled to an&s;wer <HI>guilty</HI> or <HI>not guilty.</HI> This operation is called in their books <HI>paine forte &amp; dure.</HI> But this &s;avage proce&s;s is now ob&s;olete: and it is declared by &s;tatute, that &s;tand|ing ob&s;tinately mute &s;hall be an equivalent to a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt, and &s;entence &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed ac|cordingly. The ca&s;e never occurs now. The pri|&s;oner generally pleads <HI>not guilty,</HI> and is thereby &s;aid to join in i&s;&s;ue, and put him&s;elf upon his trial. If he is a &s;tranger, or &s;o poor that he cannot en|gage an advocate to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his defence, the judges always a&s;&s;ign him council, and allow him &s;ome &s;hort time for preparation.</P>
<P>WHEN the day of trial comes, the pri&s;oner is again &s;ent for to court; for it is e&s;&s;ential to the proce&s;s that he &s;hould be per&s;onally pre&s;ent during the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;heriff hath previou&s;ly &s;ummoned a number of per&s;ons to &s;erve on the <HI>pe|tit jury.</HI> Twelve per&s;ons, and no more, are nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="203" REF="024407_0596_0FC6F93032C88CA0">
for this purpo&s;e; but he generally returns forty-eight or more names to the court, according to circum&s;tances, becau&s;e the accu&s;ed hath a right to make many objections. The&s;e names are called over in court, and the per&s;ons who appear are pre|&s;ented one by one before the pri&s;oner, who is de|&s;ired to look at him, and &s;ay whether he has any objection to his being one of the jury which is to determine his fate. If the crime charged is capital, the pri&s;oner has a legal right to <HI>challenge perempto|rily</HI> twenty of the per&s;ons offered for jurymen, that is, to &s;et them a&s;ide from caprice, from a di&s;like to their countenances, or any other &s;ecret motive, without giving any rea&s;on for his &s;o doing; and he has, moreover, a right to challenge or object to as many more as he ran give &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for rejecting: &s;uch as the per&s;on offered being in any degree intere&s;ted in the event; his having pre|judged the matter, by declaring his opinion in conver&s;ation; his having heretofore been convict|ed of perjury, with many other cau&s;es of legal di&s;ability.</P>
<P>WHEN this inve&s;tigation is gone through, and twelve unexceptionable per&s;ons appear, who have all been &s;worn, <HI>well and truly to try the cau&s;e de|pending, and a true verdict give according to the evidence,</HI> they are put together in a convenient
<PB N="204" REF="024407_0597_0FC6F931C8583B00">
place, to hear the whole matter, and mu&s;t not &s;e|parate until a final deci&s;ion is given; nor mu&s;t any per&s;on whi&s;per or &s;peak to them (except when they a&s;k que&s;tions of the court or of the witne&s;&s;es) or deliver any me&s;&s;age or writing to them; any of the&s;e happening would vitiate the whole proce&s;s. Yet the judges, the lawyers employed, or the pri|&s;oner, may addre&s;s them aloud in open court. If a juryman &s;hould have occa&s;ion to retire during the trial, he mu&s;t a&s;k leave of the court, and a con&s;table mu&s;t attend him the whole time of his ab&s;ence, and the proceedings mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pended till his return.</P>
<P>THE trial commences by the king's attorney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or the clerk of the court for him.</NOTE> reading the indictment aloud to the jury: after which he produces his witne&s;&s;es in &s;upport of the accu&s;ation. The&s;e witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t all be examined on oath, and deliver their te&s;timony <HI>viva voce</HI> in the pre&s;ence of the pri&s;oner, and of the whole court. After the king's attorney hath done with a witne&s;s, the advocate for the pri&s;oner cro&s;s examines him: he a&s;ks him que&s;tions which may tend to embarra&s;s him: he pre&s;&s;es him as to the certainty of his knowledge: he endeavours to make him contra|dict him&s;elf; or &s;ay &s;omething that may indicate
<PB N="205" REF="024407_0598_0FC6F934023A86B0">
pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t; and exerci&s;es every art that may tend to invalidate his te&s;timony, or weaken its force. If the&s;e manoeuvres, however, are carried too far, the judge will, or ought to, interfere, and check a too great licentiou&s;ne&s;s in the treatment of a witne&s;s. When the king's attorney hath pro|duced all his te&s;timony, he addre&s;&s;es the jury; he recapitulates what the witne&s;&s;es have advanced; he enforces the law, and applies it to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and &s;upports his arguments by authorities from the books re&s;pecting ca&s;es of the like na|ture.</P>
<P>THE council for the pri&s;oner then produces his witne&s;&s;es in behalf of the accu&s;ed, who are al&s;o &s;e|verally cro&s;s examined by the king's attorney. When the whole of the te&s;timony has been exhibi|ted, of which the judges and the council take notes in writing, the lawyer for the pri&s;oner begins his defence: he dwells upon, and enforces every fa|vourable circum&s;tance: he endeavours to invali|date or throw doubts upon the proofs again&s;t him: he labours to explain away the law, and finally addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the tender feelings of the jury. He mu&s;t now di&s;play the whole of his abilities, for he is not allowed to &s;peak again. The king's at|torney then replies; he obviates the objections that have been made, either to the te&s;timony or to
<PB N="206" REF="024407_0599_0FC6F93568E5DD28">
his &s;tatement of the law; he points at the weak|ne&s;s of the defence; and enlarges upon the proof again&s;t the pri&s;oner; and, la&s;tly, &s;ubmits the whole matter to the determination of the jury.</P>
<P>THERE is then a cu&s;tomary, but not a nece&s;&s;ary, indulgence allowed to the pri&s;oner in capital ca&s;es: and this I think a very pathetic part of the proce&s;s. The accu&s;ed per&s;on has been all this time a &s;ilent &s;pectator of the proceedings; but he is now permitted to addre&s;s the jury him&s;elf, and tell his own &s;tory in his own way.</P>
<P>THIS, con&s;idering his critical &s;ituation, is cer|tainly a very intere&s;ting part of the ceremony; e&s;|pecially if the party is indeed innocent of the crime alledged, but labouring under a combina|tion of unlucky circum&s;tances and untoward ap|pearances. I have been more affected by the &s;im|ple narrative of the pri&s;oner him&s;elf, than by all the fini&s;hed eloquence of the council who under|took his defence.</P>
<P>AFTER this, the judge &s;ums up the whole of the te&s;timony to the jury: he omits unnece&s;&s;ary de|tails, and brings pointedly into view all tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances which are of any importance either for or again&s;t the pri&s;oner: and opens and ex|plains
<PB N="207" REF="024407_0600_0FC6F939DF6CFF88">
the law, if in the lea&s;t doubtful, and often in&s;tructs the jury what determination they ought, in his opinion, to give.</P>
<P>THE jury, being now charged with the whole matter, are conducted to &s;ome private apartment, where they are &s;hut up, and a con&s;table is placed on the out &s;ide of the door; and there they mu&s;t remain, &s;ecluded from all external communi|cation whatever, without meat, drink or &s;u&s;te|nance of any kind until they &s;hall have <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI>
agreed in their judgment. Any <HI>one</HI> di&s;&s;enting voice will annihilate the verdict or deci&s;ion. When they have all agreed, they give notice thereof to the con&s;table at the door, who immediately &s;ends information to the judge. The court, if not then &s;itting, forthwith convenes, and the pri&s;oner is again &s;ent for; for it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the verdict &s;hould be given in his pre&s;ence. The jury then come into court, and the clerk having called over their names, to &s;hew that none are mi&s;|&s;ing, a&s;ks them if they have agreed in their ver|dict?&mdash;they an&s;wer in the affirmative. He then demands of them, whether the pri&s;oner is <HI>guilty</HI>

<P>IN the fir&s;t place, the &s;heriff &s;elects and returns &s;uch per&s;ons as he plea&s;es to &s;erve on both juries: and here he has uncontrolled opportunity of gra|tifying his own partialities, if he has any, re&s;pecting the per&s;ons to be tried, or the cau&s;e depending: for it matters not what private pa&s;&s;ions or prejudi|ces the juries may have, provided they are <HI>legally</HI>
unexceptionable; and popular governments are &s;o &s;ubject to party rage, that &s;uch partialities in the &s;heriff may &s;ometimes be expected.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="024407_0604_0FC6F94695968510">INDEED, it is not uncommon for people here to form a judgment of the i&s;&s;ue of a doubtful cau&s;e, from a knowledge of the jury which is to deter|mine it. It is to guard again&s;t the &s;heriff's <HI>packing</HI>
a jury, as it is called, that peremptory challenges are allowed in capital ca&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN the grand jury is formed, the judge al|ways addre&s;&s;es them from the bench. This is cal|led charging the grand jury, and &s;hould, according to the original de&s;ign, be no more than a general delineation of their duty, and the law definitions of the crimes and offences of which they are to make enquiry, and pre&s;ent to the juri&s;diction of the court: becau&s;e the&s;e men being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elected from the ma&s;s of the people, are not &s;uppo&s;ed to be ver&s;ed in legal preci&s;ion and niceties. But the judge often takes this opportunity of going farther: he in&s;inuates to them, that they may indict on mere <HI>probable</HI> te&s;ti|mony; that they &s;hould attend only to the te&s;timo|ny in behalf of the pro&s;ecution, and have nothing to do with any witne&s;&s;es but tho&s;e whom the king's attorney &s;hall &s;end to them; and that if they find the bill, it will amount to nothing more than a kind of legal accu&s;ation, which, if wrong, will be afterwards &s;et right by the petit jury. But this is a deviation from the original con&s;titution, which placed the grand jury at the fir&s;t entrance
<PB N="212" REF="024407_0605_0FC6F9476194A248">
of the law to &s;creen the innocent from malicious pro&s;ecutions. For what with confinement, ex|pence, and infamy, a man may be effectually ruin|ed by the grand jury's finding a bill again&s;t him, although he may be afterwards fully acquitted by the petit jury.</P>
<P>THUS charged, however, the grand jury retire. Now it &s;hould be con&s;idered that the&s;e are called off from their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s to perform a tem|porary duty, not very agreeable in it&s;elf, and at|tended with no profit; but, on the contrary, &s;ome|what expen&s;ive. The ideas they have imbibed from the charge, have a great tendency to relax the binding force of their oath of office: their pre&s;ent duty is in the law line, and they do not pretend to under&s;tand law: but the judge who does under|&s;tand it, has in&s;tructed them; and on his opinion they re&s;t the &s;anctity of their oath, and the rights of their &s;tation. When &s;uch principles prevail, the real u&s;e of a grand jury is in a great mea&s;ure &s;et a&s;ide, and the in&s;titution becomes rather a burthen|&s;ome ceremony, than a real advantage.</P>
<P>THE judge has a manife&s;t influence over both the grand and petit juries; but he mu&s;t exerci&s;e this with moderation and di&s;cretion; for the peo|ple have in general a pretty ju&s;t knowledge of
<PB N="113" REF="024407_0606_0FC6F952548480A0">
their fundamental rights; the&s;e they will &s;uffer to be impaired through indolence, inattention, or per|&s;ua&s;ion, but will never &s;uffer them to be directly violated or called in que&s;tion. The judge may in&s;inuate any thing, but if he openly a&s;&s;umes un|con&s;titutional powers over the jury, he is &s;ure to be oppo&s;ed with invincible firmne&s;s. And when ever an open conte&s;t of this kind happens, the ju|ry will certainly have the popular current in their favour, unle&s;s they &s;hould be &s;o notoriou&s;ly in the the wrong as to preclude all defence of their conduct.</P>
<P>THE petit jury, are now to be formed, or, as it is called, <HI>impannelled.</HI> And here again is a large field for contrivance and addre&s;s. In &s;uits for damages or for property, great dexterity is ex|erci&s;ed on both &s;ides for &s;ecuring proper men on the jury. So great are the apprehen&s;ions of un|fairne&s;s and di&s;advantage in this particular, that it is common for the parties in the &s;uit to demand that the cau&s;e &s;hall be tried by what is called a <HI>&s;truck jury.</HI> When this happens the prothonotary, or clerk of the court, makes out a li&s;t of 48 good and law|ful men of the county, and from this li&s;t the par|ties, or their attornies for them, alternately &s;trike out the names of &s;uch as they do not approve until there are but 24 names left. The&s;e
<PB N="214" REF="024407_0607_0FC6F954DC714BB8">
24 are &s;ummoned by the &s;heriff to attend the court, and the fir&s;t 12 of the number who &s;hall make their appearance on the day of trial, and an&s;wer to their names, are to compo&s;e the jury who are to determine the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER the jury have been impannelled, have heard the te&s;timony and the arguments, and the judge has &s;ummed up the whole matter, they retire to form their verdict. For this pur|po&s;e, as I before ob&s;erved, they are excluded from all external communication, &s;u&s;tenance, or comfort. By the&s;e means they are compelled to make up a unanimous opinion or &s;tarve, be the ca&s;e never &s;o doubtful or difficult. In this lies the principal fallacy of the &s;y&s;tem; ina&s;much as it is next to an impo&s;&s;ibility that twelve men, of various tempers, abilities and knowledge, &s;hould freely and decidedly unite in judgment on a di&s;putable and uncertain ca&s;e. The truth is, they &s;eldom &s;uffer any great extremities for con&s;cience &s;ake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"And wretches hang, that jurymen may dine."</P>
<BIBL><HI>Garth.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. The la&s;t impre&s;&s;ions they received came from the judge; his &s;tation, his authority, his knowledge in the law, will give an almo&s;t invincible force to the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions. And the re&s;ult is, that nine times in ten, the verdict, e&s;pecially in civil ca&s;es, is made conformably to his opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="024407_0608_0FC6F95667C85F38">THE de&s;ignated legal power of an Engli&s;h judge is not very con&s;iderable; but the <HI>official influence</HI>
he has over the determinations of juries, &s;ubjects, in a great degree, the lives and property of the people to his judgment or caprice. And this ma&s;ked power is the more dangerous; becau&s;e, if he &s;hould be partial, unju&s;t, or corrupt, his conduct is &s;creened by the intervention of the jury, the fi|nal deci&s;ion being their verdict, not his.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e the judge &s;tates the ca&s;e impar|tially to the jury, without making any attempt to bias their judgment; the con&s;equence is, that &s;ome leading man in the jury will bring over the re&s;t to his opinion, or &s;ome very ob&s;tinate man wear out the patience of his fellows. There have been in&s;tances when eleven have agreed upon a verdict and the per&s;evering twelfth has com|pelled them to change their minds, and yield to the &s;uperior &s;trength of his con&s;titution. It of|ten happens that a verdict is put to the vote, and the minority accedes to the opinion of the majority. But mo&s;t commonly the verdict is determined by the advice of the judge, or the opinion of one of the jury of more reputed knowledge than the re&s;t. So that in di&s;putable ca&s;es, it &s;eldom, if ever, happens that the final verdict is that free, clear, and una|nimous deci&s;ion of twelve impartial men, under
<PB N="216" REF="024407_0609_0FC6F95B0296B458">
oath, which the law pre&s;umes, and which the &s;y|&s;tem requires. If two or more of the jury &s;hould be of contrary opinions, and neither will give way, no verdict can po&s;&s;ibly be given in. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, which &s;ometimes occurs, there is but one remedy, which indeed is not countenanced by law, but &s;ugge&s;ted by nece&s;&s;ity. It is this. The &s;heriff, or &s;ome body for him, &s;teals away one of the jury from the bar, &s;o that when the clerk calls over their names, it is found that there are but eleven jurymen, and this invalidates all the proceedings. The bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be put off to another court, and the whole proce&s;s begun <HI>de novo.</HI></P>
<P>IF, when the verdict is given in, the judge &s;hould not approve of it, he &s;ometimes takes the liberty of &s;ending back the jury to recon&s;ider the mat|ter; but if they per&s;i&s;t, he mu&s;t finally &s;ubmit and record the verdict. But &s;uch ca&s;es &s;eldom occur. In general the juries take their tone from the judge's charge. When they have given in their deci&s;ion, they are di&s;charged, and di&s;per&s;e, and are never after accountable for what they have done, unle&s;s in ca&s;es of manife&s;t corruption. It is with them, as with all popular bodies&mdash;the individuals never think them&s;elves re&s;pon&s;ible for what the whole have done.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="024407_0610_0FC6F95C7086BAC0">IN cau&s;es which do not &s;o much depend upon expo&s;itions of law, &s;uch as an equitable adju&s;tment of long and intricate accounts, or &s;atisfaction for injuries which cannot &s;o well be a&s;certained by le|gal te&s;timony, it is cu&s;tomary for the contend|ing parties to con&s;ent in open court to a reference. Whereupon the judges nominate three or more in|different per&s;ons to hear and arbitrate the matters in variance. The&s;e arbitrators are not compelled to be unanimous, neither are they &s;ubjected to the other re&s;trictions of a jury. They meet when and where they plea&s;e, they inve&s;tigate the bu&s;i|ne&s;s in their own manner, and in their own time, and finally &s;end their award in writing to the court. And this award, when received and re|corded, becomes the judgment of the court.</P>
<P>ARBITRATIONS are liable to this imperfection. The arbitrators not having the opinion of the judge to re&s;t upon, not being re&s;trained by rigid rules, being few in number, and moving in an enlarged &s;phere of inve&s;tigation, are more pointed|ly and per&s;onally an&s;werable, in reputation at lea&s;t, for the rectitude and propriety of their de|termination. In this &s;ituation, the general aim, in difficult ca&s;es is, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;atisfy both the contending parties, and &s;o avoid the complaints or cen&s;ures of either; and this they frequently ac|compli&s;h
<PB N="218" REF="024407_0611_0FC6F95DF4948A70">
by halving the value in di&s;pute between them, when it can be done; and thus &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice is done to neither.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the Engli&s;h law leans &s;o &s;trongly in favour of the accu&s;ed in criminal ca&s;es, giving every rea&s;onable advantage to the party who is put up|on his defence, yet the form of proce&s;s is &s;o decid|ed, and &s;o well under&s;tood, that unnece&s;&s;ary delays &s;eldom occur; but this is far from being the ca&s;e in civil actions, which are attended with &s;o many complex circum&s;tances, forms, and delays, all which incur a con&s;iderable expence, that the plaintiff, unle&s;s in very plain ca&s;es, &s;uch as an un|di&s;puted bond, or note of hand, had better put up with a &s;mall injury or lo&s;s, than to pro&s;ecute his &s;uit, although in the end he &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful. For here the the law is &s;o unrea&s;onably in favour of the defendant, and allows him &s;o many dilatory pleas, cau&s;es of adjournment, and removals from court to court, that a wealthy wrong-doer, with the help of able council, may weary out the mo&s;t equitable claimant by exhau&s;ting his patience and his pur&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN an action is brought, the right or wrong of the ca&s;e, or what is called the me|rits of the cau&s;e, never come into view till to|wards
<PB N="219" REF="024407_0612_0FC6F9641D5191C8">
the clo&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s. The only que&s;|tion is, whether the plaintiff hath brought, and conducted his claim, according to the &s;trict forms of law, which forms are not &s;ettled by any code or determinate &s;y&s;tem; but mu&s;t be gathered from the authorities, that is, from the reports of former determinations when like points of proce&s;s have been conte&s;ted. The intention of throwing the&s;e ob&s;tacles in the way of ju&s;tice is to prevent the plaintiff from over-reaching the defendant in any &s;tage of the proce&s;s. But the evils attending this extreme caution are more than a balance to the dangers it is de&s;igned to obviate.</P>
<P>IT would be in vain for me to give you the hi|&s;tory of the many cau&s;es of delay that may legal|ly occur in the pur&s;uit of a manife&s;tly equitable title to a tract of land, whole volumes would be in&s;ufficient to the purpo&s;e; my pre&s;ent object on|ly re&s;pects the mode of trial by jury, not the ge|neral practice of the law in this country.</P>
<P>THE re&s;ult of my ob&s;ervations amounts to this, that perfection is not to be looked for in human in&s;titutions. The Briti&s;h form of govern|ment, as well as Briti&s;h juri&s;prudence, exhibits a &s;pecious appearance of perfect &s;ecurity to the &s;ub|ject; but this perfect &s;ecurity exi&s;ts only in the
<PB N="220" REF="024407_0613_0FC6F96675A24538">
theory; the propo&s;ed object of the &s;y&s;tem is to en&s;ure to the people all the good effects of wi&s;dom and integrity in their rulers and officers of ju&s;tice; but wi&s;dom and integrity are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the due execution of the plan. So that the effects promi&s;ed mu&s;t in fact precede the opera|tion; which is a political <HI>petitio principii.</HI></P>
<P>IN England, all laws are &s;uppo&s;ed to be made by the free con&s;ent of the people, by means of their repre&s;entatives; and judical deci&s;ions to be the verdict of twelve impartial men, unanimous in their opinions. Neither of the&s;e po&s;itions are &s;trictly true in fact. It is mo&s;t notorious, that, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the members of parliament fre|quently purcha&s;e the voices of the people, and af|terwards &s;ell their own and votes to the king or his mini&s;ter; &s;o that the king can almo&s;t al|ways command a majority of parliamentary voices. And, in the &s;econd ca&s;e, the authority of the judge mo&s;t commonly influences the verdict of a jury; &s;o that in truth, the king makes the laws, and the judges execute them, whil&s;t the people only <HI>&s;eem</HI> to do both;&mdash;and they remain content with this <HI>&s;eeming,</HI> until admini&s;tration becomes too manife&s;tly oppre&s;&s;ive and corrupt. When this happens they &s;truggle for original rights, by
<PB N="221" REF="024407_0614_0FC6F9691A719B88">
in&s;urrections and revolutions; which is the po|pular remedy common to every government, when that government is &s;o exerci&s;ed as to become in|&s;upportable.</P>
<P>THESE remarks may perhaps appear too &s;e|vere, but they are founded in truth. A candid Engli&s;hman would acknowledge, that the imper|fections I have pointed at, may, and &s;ometimes do, occur in their political &s;y&s;tem; but he would urge, and with &s;ome rea&s;on too, that, all circum|&s;tances con&s;idered, all evils balanced, and all in|conveniences averaged, the con&s;titution of his country is the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t yet devi&s;ed for uni|ting the&s;e two difficult problems&mdash;<HI>The &s;ecurity of the people's rights, with the dignity and vigour of government.</HI></P>
<P>I will readily acknowledge, that, upon the whole, ju&s;tice is well adminini&s;tred in this country; but I believe this is more owing to the abilities and integrity of their judges, than to the infallibility of their &s;y&s;tem. A bad judge might be a cur&s;e to the people, without directly violating the legal rules of his official conduct.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I am of opinion, that the happine&s;s of a people depends more upon their
<PB N="222" REF="024407_0615_0FC6F971EF79E670">
national character than their form of government. A truly enlightened people cannot be en&s;laved real de&s;poti&s;m cannot be exerci&s;ed, unle&s;s the ma&s;s of the people are either &s;tupidly ignorant, gro&s;sly licentious and immoral, or extremely begotted. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, they &s;ubmit to every impo&s;ition, becau&s;e they know nothing of the rights of na|ture, or the origin of delegated power; in the &s;econd, they become enervated by luxury, and indifferent to tho&s;e rights and privileges, of which they have rendered them&s;elves unworthy; and, in the third, their tyrant will take care to have the prie&s;thood on his &s;ide, and make the con&s;ciences of his &s;ubjects the chains by which he will hold them in the mo&s;t abject &s;ervitude; or, which is not improbable, the prie&s;thood will be them&s;elves the tyrants, and keep both the &s;o|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ign and his people under a mo&s;t rigid con|troul.</P>
<P>OF all the means by which a nation may be made mi&s;erable, this la&s;t is the mo&s;t wicked and mo&s;t effectual. Freed from this &s;ervitude, a peo|ple cannot, in this age of the world, long remain either &s;tupidly ignorant, or gro&s;sly immoral; but inexorable bigotry and rooted &s;uper&s;tition lock up the doors of knowledge and preclude reformation.

<P>THE manife&s;t purpo&s;e of the pamphlet before me is to ju&s;tify the <HI>Bank of North-America</HI> as a u&s;e|ful in&s;titution, notwith&s;tanding that it hath been declared by act of a&s;&s;embly to be a pernicious cor|poration, and incompatible with the public &s;afety; and to &s;hew that the legi&s;lature had no legal right to deprive it of its charter; and al&s;o to cen&s;ure and ridicule a re&s;pectable committee of the hou&s;e, upon who&s;e report the act for disfranchi&s;ing the bank was founded.</P>
<P>IN order to prove that the a&s;&s;embly had no right to retract a charter once granted, without &s;ome legal forfeiture or breach of conditions on the part of the grantees, he re&s;ts the fulcrum of his argu|ments on certain fir&s;t principles of government. Now, if the&s;e fir&s;t principles &s;hould be found on ex|amination to be laid on hollow ground; that is, that
<PB N="227" REF="024407_0620_0FC6F97E1D5DC6C8">
however true they may be in rea&s;on, they are not true in fact, it will follow, that the author, the pam|phlet, the argument, and the bank of North-Ame|rica, mu&s;t all &s;ink together&mdash;Let us then take a &s;hort view of this writer's ground work.</P>
<P><HI>COMMON-SENSE</HI> tells us, that in all governments there mu&s;t be a &s;overeign power &s;omewhere, and that the repo&s;itory where this &s;overeignty is placed is the fir&s;t criterion of di&s;tinction between a de&s;po|tic form of government and a free country: that in the fir&s;t, it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an individual in here|ditary right; in the &s;econd, it is held by the peo|ple at large, and by them periodically a&s;&s;igned to their delegates or repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>THE fallacy of this &s;uppo&s;ed axiom con&s;i&s;ts in his con&s;idering &s;overeign power as a &s;imple elemen|tary principle; whereas it is manife&s;tly divi&s;ible in|to at lea&s;t two component parts: viz. <HI>power,</HI> con|&s;idered only in reference to the act or thing done, or to be done; and <HI>will,</HI> con&s;idered as influencing and dictating the exerci&s;e of that power. For in|&s;tance, in a mill, the <HI>power</HI> of grinding corn is in the &s;tones, wheels, and movements of the machine; but the <HI>will</HI> is in the miller, who &s;uperintends and go|verns its operations.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="024407_0621_0FC6F98419673068">A mere act of <HI>power</HI> may be exerci&s;ed without the concurrence of the <HI>will</HI>: and that there may be a <HI>will,</HI> without a <HI>power</HI> to carry it into effect, will not be denied. Now the true criterion of di&s;tincti|on between a de&s;potic rule and the free govern|ment of Penn&s;ylvania con&s;i&s;ts in this; that in the former ca&s;e, the <HI>will</HI> and <HI>power</HI> are both inherent in an individual and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; whereas in Penn&s;ylvania, the <HI>power</HI> of making laws is in the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly; but the <HI>will</HI> that &s;ugge&s;ts, dictates to, and influences this <HI>power,</HI> is lodg|ed with certain learned and worthy per&s;ons, who are not members of that hou&s;e, and who are not ve&s;ted with the power of actually making laws.</P>
<P>I begin to perceive that I have involved my&s;elf in a very difficult and &s;ubtle argument&mdash;I wi&s;h I may be able to make my&s;elf under&s;tood.</P>
<P>A majority of voices in the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly have an undoubted right to order the &s;eals of the commonwealth to be affixed to a bill which hath previou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed the forms of legi&s;lation. The &s;eals being thus affixed, that bill becomes a law, binding on all whom it may concern, being citizens of the &s;tate. Now this is a mere naked act of <HI>power,</HI> the authenticity of which does not at all depend on a
<PB N="229" REF="024407_0622_0FC6F9866F5FCAD8">
genuine concurrence of <HI>will</HI> in tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it; for the <HI>will</HI> is either directly or remotely the offspring of the under&s;tanding; yet the law would be valid, although the majority that voted it into exi&s;tence, &s;hould be totally ignorant of its principles and operation.</P>
<P>I will put a ca&s;e, which I confe&s;s, is a very ab|&s;urd one; but it will &s;erve to illu&s;trate my argu|ment.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a conte&s;t &s;hould ari&s;e re&s;pecting the true tran&s;lation of a pa&s;&s;age in the original Hebrew bible; and that this difference of opinion &s;hould occa&s;ion &s;uch hot di&s;putes and angry parties in the &s;tate as to make it nece&s;&s;ary for the legi&s;lature to interfere and determine the point. Suppo&s;e innumerable petitions <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> to be laid before the hou&s;e, and that at la&s;t a committee &s;hould be appointed to <HI>enquire</HI> and report upon the merits of the que&s;tion. This committee having no know|ledge of the Hebrew tongue will naturally apply to &s;ome learned men&mdash;heads of one of the parties, but not members of the hou&s;e, who will tell them&mdash;
<Q>This is a bu&s;ine&s;s you do not under&s;tand&mdash;a&s;|&s;emblymen never read Hebrew, they only read new&s;papers&mdash;but we will draw up a report for you.</Q>
The report is accordingly drawn up by
<PB N="230" REF="024407_0623_0FC6F98802D03318">
the&s;e learned men&mdash;the committee adopt it&mdash;they lay it before the hou&s;e&mdash;a bill is drawn conforma|bly thereto, and pa&s;&s;ed into a law, and &s;o the que&s;|tion is decided. Now, in this tran&s;action there is a manife&s;t &s;eparation of the <HI>will</HI> from the <HI>power.</HI> The committee had the power of pre&s;enting the report, and the hou&s;e of pa&s;&s;ing it into a law; but neither the committee nor the hou&s;e could po&s;&s;ibly exerci&s;e any <HI>will</HI> on a &s;ubject of which they had not the lea&s;t knowledge or under&s;tanding. Their <HI>will</HI> might, indeed, be exerci&s;ed in the &s;ervice of the party they wi&s;hed to favour, but not in the deci&s;ion of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>On the&s;e principles I venture to a&s;&s;ert in vindi|cation of a late committee on the affairs of the bank, again&s;t the a&s;per&s;ions of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> that, let their report be proper or improper, let the law pa&s;&s;ed thereupon be ju&s;t or unju&s;t, no cen&s;ure can po&s;&s;ibly lie again&s;t the committee, becau&s;e, &s;ome few in&s;tances excepted, no man is re&s;pon&s;ible for an act in which his <HI>will</HI> did not concur.</P>
<P>BUT the committee does not &s;tand in need of this or any other defence: their report was per|fectly ju&s;t and proper, and exhibited an intimate knowledge of the con&s;titution and tendency of the bank of North-America: as I &s;hall fully &s;hew
<PB N="231" REF="024407_0624_0FC6F98ED2C69C30">
when I come to enumerate the high crimes of the pre&s;ident, directors, and &s;tockholders of our national bank.</P>
<P>SOVEREIGNTY being thus divi&s;ible into <HI>will</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> the advantage of our free government con|&s;i&s;ts in this, that let who will exerci&s;e the <HI>power</HI> in the hou&s;e of legi&s;lation, the <HI>will</HI> of government may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by worthy and enterpri&s;ing men out of the hou&s;e, by which the labour of law-mak|ing is divided and becomes ea&s;y and advantageous.</P>
<P>ON this &s;ingularity in our political &s;y&s;tem is founded a doctrine, not long &s;ince advanced by learned men, which, if e&s;tabli&s;hed, mu&s;t fully an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of tho&s;e who di&s;covered it, viz. that a&s;&s;emblies, juries, and &s;uch confidential appoint|ments are nothing more than LEGAL MACHINES, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. p. 205</NOTE>
de&s;igned to give legal &s;anction to the views of tho&s;e, who from &s;uperior abilities and official greatne&s;s, are be&s;t qualified to influence and direct them. It would be a &s;trange thing indeed if the mill &s;hould grind what &s;ort of grain it plea&s;ed, and go, or &s;top, according to its own caprices.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> has taken a wrong ground of argument is plain from this. He gives a copy
<PB N="232" REF="024407_0625_0FC6F99023607CF0">
our bill of rights, and from thence deduces his &s;y&s;tem of rea&s;oning. It had been more to the purpo&s;e, if, in&s;tead of a bill of <HI>rights,</HI> he had given us a bill of <HI>facts.</HI> A bill of rights is a very u&s;eful thing in the commencement of a common|wealth; like leading &s;trings for a child it a&s;&s;i&s;ts it in walking before it has &s;trength to go alone. But when the government is e&s;tabli&s;hed, what occa&s;ion can there be for a bill of rights? When the hou&s;e is built, the &s;caffolding &s;hould be taken away. When the Ship is launched, &s;he leaves her former &s;upports behind.</P>
<P>IT may be a&s;ked if the bill of rights and our frame of government are no longer to be regar|ded, where &s;hall we look for a rule of conduct?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, <HI>precedent</HI> will always furni&s;h &s;ufficient rules of conduct. In the commencement of a republic, it is plain there can be no <HI>precedents:</HI>
all things are then new; and a bill of rights, and a de&s;ignated con&s;titution, mu&s;t be the &s;tandards of authority. As the republic advances in &s;trength and &s;tability, <HI>precedents</HI> &s;prout &s;pontaneou&s;ly, kill the roots of original rights, and in time occupy the whole ground. The only difficulty is to create and e&s;tabli&s;h the fir&s;t precedent. This done, it
<PB N="233" REF="024407_0626_0FC6F991B00D6058">
will &s;oon become a powerful engine. Like an anchor to windward, it will enable the &s;kilful pilot to warp the &s;hip again&s;t wind and tide. It will al&s;o prove very prolific; for a good <HI>precedent,</HI> like a good potatoe, contains within it&s;elf the eyes or germs of many future precedents or potatoes.</P>
<P>FOR example&mdash;In an early period of our politi|cal exi&s;tence it &s;eemed no great impropriety that committees of the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly &s;hould take the opinions of the judges on que&s;tions re&s;pecting mere law-points. But this &s;oon grew to a cu&s;tom of &s;ending not que&s;tions only, but the bills them|&s;elves, to the judges for con&s;ideration. Thus en|couraged, their honours &s;oon undertook to recom|mend, and even draw petitions to the a&s;&s;embly for or again&s;t mea&s;ures which they wi&s;hed to promote or oppo&s;e; to frame reports for committees; and originated bills for the legi&s;lature; and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h, by <HI>precedent,</HI> an out-of-doors influence, &s;o &s;trong as virtually to po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>will</HI> of govern|ment; leaving to the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly the more <HI>mechanical power</HI> of enacting laws.</P>
<P>THUS hath a total change, in effect, taken place in our con&s;titution. We began with a &s;in|gle branch of legi&s;lation, and it is manife&s;t that we
<PB N="234" REF="024407_0627_0FC6F997305346E0">
have now three di&s;tinct branches, viz. an upper hou&s;e, a lower hou&s;e, and a legi&s;lative council. Our upper hou&s;e, it is well known, meet at the &s;tate hou&s;e in Che&s;nut Street; the lower hou&s;e a&s;&s;emble at the Indian Queen in Market Street<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The members of a&s;&s;embly, who at this time combined to form a majority in the hou&s;e, u&s;ed to meet in the evening at the Indian Queen, and there debate on que&s;tions which were to be agitated next day in the hou&s;e. After debate, the que&s;tion was put to vote, and the then minority were to vote next day in a&s;&s;embly, not ac|cording to their own judgments, but according to this previous determination. Such was the compact between them. See Page 86.</NOTE>, and the judges from the &s;upreme court form the legi&s;lative council. This council, in conjunction with the lower hou&s;e, is the repo&s;itory of the <HI>will</HI>
of our &s;overeignty, having a direct influence upon the acts of government whil&s;t under deliberation. And the council have, by <HI>precedent,</HI> acquired a &s;eparate and exclu&s;ive right of <HI>revi&s;ing, altering, and amending,</HI> the laws <HI>after they have been enacted and publi&s;hed.</HI> And thus hath our bill of <HI>facts</HI>
introduced a form of government very different from that de&s;ignated in our bill of <HI>rights</HI> and ori|ginal con&s;titution.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn, to &s;atisfaction I hope, that <HI>common Sen&s;e</HI> hath entirely mi&s;taken the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, it follows, that all

his arguments, founded on what our &s;y&s;tem of government <HI>was,</HI> in&s;tead of what <HI>it is,</HI> mu&s;t fall to the ground. Among&s;t the&s;e, the fir&s;t in rank is a &s;ubtile di&s;tinction between an <HI>act</HI> and a <HI>law.</HI> The de&s;ign of which is to &s;hew that there are not two &s;orts of ju&s;tice in nature. That the &s;ame ju&s;tice which binds individuals in a bargain, &s;hould bind the public in contracts. That the a&s;&s;embly, as the repre&s;entative body of the people, have a right to make contracts with individuals, and that the party or parties contracted with, have an intere&s;t in the bargain, which they cannot ju&s;tly be deprived of by a mere arbitrary change of opinion in the grantor. Becau&s;e, &s;uch a con|tract is an <HI>act,</HI> and not a <HI>law,</HI> &s;ubject to repeal at plea&s;ure. And &s;o applying this doctrine to the ca&s;e of the bank, he infers that the a&s;&s;embly had no right to deprive that corporation of its character.</P>
<P>BUT the fallacy of this rea&s;oning will appear, by con&s;idering the facts and principles ju&s;t &s;tated; I mean the &s;eparation of the <HI>will</HI> from the <HI>power,</HI> in the &s;overeignty of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a remon&s;trance to be made to the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, repre&s;enting, in &s;trong and plau&s;ible terms, the inju&s;tice in thus depriving the

bank of its charter, without any legal conviction of its offence, or forfeiture on the part of that in&s;ti|tion; the natural an&s;wer would be,
<Q>the bu|&s;ine&s;s of this hou&s;e is determined by a majority of voices; <HI>that</HI> majority is &s;ecured by the lower hou&s;e, and influenced and directed by the legi&s;lative council.

<P>SHOULD application then be made to the lower hou&s;e, and legi&s;lative council, they would &s;ay,

<P><PB N="239" REF="024407_0632_0FC6F9A83A9D95B0">LET us now take a &s;hort view of the pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation of the bank. A learned and enlightened committee of the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, <HI>after a fair and impartial enquiry,</HI> have found and reported&mdash;
<Q>That the bank, as at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed, is in every view incompatible with the public &s;afety</Q>
&mdash;and a law founded on this report, hath been du|ly enacted, taking from that in&s;titution the charter which the imprudence of a former a&s;&s;embly had <HI>granted and confirmed to it.</HI> To what purpo&s;e then, I again a&s;k, has <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> taken &s;o much pains? This corporation, &s;o far as it depends for exi&s;tence on the charter in que&s;tion, exi&s;ts no more. This cannot be denied. Does this author expect that our pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embly &s;hould work miracles, and rai&s;e the dead? He cries out again&s;t the ille|gality of the proceedings that disfranchi&s;ed the bank; what good can this do? After a criminal has been executed, what purpo&s;e can it an&s;wer to to di&s;cover in&s;ufficiencies in the court that convict|ed him, or irregularities in his trial? Will the&s;e di&s;coveries bring the man to life, and give him the chance of a new and fairer trial? Surely not.</P>
<P>A corporation can have but <HI>one</HI> life, viz. a legal or political life; but an individual may have <HI>two</HI> lives, and may exi&s;t in one, though deprived of the other&mdash;that is, an individual may be alive and in
<PB N="240" REF="024407_0633_0FC6F9A99BB8E0C8">
health in <HI>fact,</HI> and at the &s;ame time ab&s;olutely dead in <HI>law.</HI> An in&s;tance of this happened &s;ome time &s;ince in the county of York. At a court of common pleas there, an ingenious lawyer contrived to have a report brought into court, that the plaintiff, in a certain action then depending, had &s;uddenly died. This report was circulated with &s;uch probable circum&s;tances that nobody doubted but that the poor man was dead. The action of cour&s;e abated by the death of the plaintiff, and it was &s;o entered upon the docket. At the next court the plaintiff appeared in <HI>propria per&s;ona,</HI> and complained loud|ly of the injury that had been done him by this fal&s;e report: but the ingenious lawyer afore&s;aid, ro&s;e up and a&s;&s;ured the court that the man was dead, notwith&s;tanding his impertinent intru&s;ion there: and for the truth of this, he appealed to the entry on the docket; hoping that the court would not allow any te&s;timony to be given in con|tradiction to a record, which, he ob&s;erved, is the highe&s;t &s;tandard of truth known in law.</P>
<P>NOW, although an individual may enjoy a dou|ble or two-fold life&mdash;as is clear from this man's being capable of a double death, for the plaintiff certainly died over again&mdash;yet corporations having no real, but only a political exi&s;tence, can die but once. Well! then, the annulling the charter of

the bank, having deprived that in&s;titution of its political life, &s;o far at lea&s;t as it depended there|upon, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bank had a charter from Congre&s;s, as well as from the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania</NOTE> it nece&s;&s;arily follows that this bank is de|funct, demi&s;ed, decea&s;ed, and departed. And there is but one way left, that I know of, in which it can make its appearance among&s;t us; and that is, by the walking of its di&s;contented gho&s;t.</P>
<P>SOME have thought that the bank may &s;till be con&s;idered as politically exi&s;ting, by virtue of the charter it holds under the Congre&s;s of the United States: but as this is a very nice que&s;tion, and re|plete with law learning, I &s;hall re&s;erve it for future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in a chapter by it&s;elf. It only remains now to &s;hew, that the bank has ju&s;tly de&s;erved the fate it has found, by enumerating &s;ome of the ma|nifold crimes and mi&s;demeanors it has committed, and the horrible dangers and evils to the &s;tate with which that in&s;titution was pregnant.</P>
<P>I cannot do this better than by following the &s;teps of that enlightened committee, who may be &s;aid to have been the jury which pa&s;&s;ed between the commonwealth and the bank on its life and death, under the &s;acred &s;anction of an oath of of|fice.

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>THE committee, to whom were referred the petitions con|cerning the bank, e&s;tabli&s;hed at Philadelphia, and who were in|&s;tructed to enquire, whether the &s;aid bank be compatible with the public &s;afety, and that equality which ought ever to prevail between the individuals of a republic, beg leave to report: that it is the opinion of this committee, that the &s;aid bank, as at pre|&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed, is in every view incompatible with the public &s;afe|ty. That in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our trade, the &s;aid bank has a di|rect tendency to bani&s;h a great part of the &s;pecie from the coun|try, &s;o as to produce a &s;carcity of money, and to collect into the hands ot the &s;tockholders of the &s;aid bank, almo&s;t the whole of the money which remains among&s;t us. That, the accumulation of enormous wealth in the hands of a &s;ociety who claim perpetual duration, will nece&s;&s;arily produce a degree of influence and power which cannot be entru&s;ted in the hands of any &s;et of men, what&s;oever, without endangering the public &s;afety. That, the &s;aid bank, in its corporate capacity, is empowered to hold e&s;tates to the amount of ten millions of dollars; and, by the tenor of the pre&s;ent charter is to exi&s;t for ever, without being obliged to yield any emolument to the government, or to be at all dependant upon it. That, the great profits of the bank, which will daily encrea&s;e as money grows &s;carcer, and which already far exceeds the profit of European banks, have tempted foreigners to ve&s;t their money in this bank, and thus to draw from us large &s;ums for intere&s;t. That foreigners will doubtle&s;s be more and more induced to become &s;tock-holders, until the time may arrive, when this enormous engine of power may become &s;ubject to fo|reign influence: this country may be agitated with the politics of European courts, and the good people of America reduced once more into a &s;tate of &s;ubordination and dependence upon &s;ome one or other of the European powers. That, at be&s;t, if it were even confined to the hands of Americans, it would be totally de&s;tructive of that equality which ought to prevail in a republic. We have nothing in our free and equal government capable of balancing the influence which the bank mu&s;t create; and we &s;ee nothing, which in the cour&s;e of a few years, can prevent the di|rectors of the bank from governing Penn&s;ylvania. Already we have felt its influence indirectly interfering in the mea&s;ures of the legi&s;lature. Already the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, the repre&s;enta|tives of the people, have been threatened that the credit of our pa|per currency will be bla&s;ted by the bank. And if this growing evil continues, we fear the time is not very di&s;tant when the bank will be able to dictate to the legi&s;lature what laws to pa&s;s, and what to forbear.</Q></NOTE> THAT the bank, as e&s;tabli&s;hed, is incompatible with the public &s;afety. That, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trade, it had a direct tendency to bani&s;h &s;pecie from the country, and thereby accumulate it in the hands of the &s;tock-holders. That this accu|mulation of enormous wealth in the hands of
<PB N="243" REF="024407_0636_0FC6F9B3CB75DE50">
tho&s;e very citizens who are in&s;trumental in ba|ni&s;hing wealth from the country, will nece&s;&s;arily produce a degree of influence and power which cannot be tru&s;ted in the hands of a &s;et of men, not attached to the party who&s;e intere&s;ts the commit|tee wi&s;h to promote, without endangering the very exi&s;tence of that party. That government had not received, nor was likely to receive, any advan|tage from this in&s;titution; becau&s;e it could only
<PB N="244" REF="024407_0637_0FC6F9B59E0D4C60">
<HI>borrow</HI> from the bank for public u&s;e, and not <HI>&s;eize</HI> upon the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck whenever exigence, convenience, or the views of tho&s;e in power, require it. That, the profits of the bank being in money, mu&s;t dai|ly encrea&s;e, as money grows &s;carcer; and has al|ready &s;o far exceeded the profits of European banks, as to tempt foreigners to encrea&s;e this &s;carcity of money, by ve&s;ting large &s;ums in the bank, for which they only draw intere&s;t. That, foreigner after foreigner, may be thus tempted by our encrea&s;ing &s;carcity of money, until all the &s;pecie of Europe &s;hall be accumulated in the bank; and then princes and &s;tates will hold annual meetings for the election of a pre&s;ident and direc|tors to manage this enormous engine of power: and &s;o our country will be again agitated by Eu|ropean politics, and the good people of America, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the wealth of foreign nations, will become dependant upon them. That even &s;up|po&s;ing no interference of foreigners, yet our own citizens being &s;tockholders might in time, by bani&s;hing all the &s;pecie from the country, become &s;o enormou&s;ly rich and powerful as to &s;eize on the government of the &s;tate, &s;ubvert the con&s;titution, and give legi&s;lative authority to the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank.</P>
<P>AFTER this black catalogue of offences and

po&s;&s;ible evils, who will &s;ay that the bank hath not ju&s;tly merited political death?

That one of the &s;chemes of this infernal triumvirate is to bribe the <HI>Algerines</HI> with the mo|ney of the bank to &s;eize upon all American ve&s;&s;els, except tho&s;e in which R&mdash; M&mdash;, e&s;q. is inter|e&s;ted: and another is to change our republican form of government to a monarchy.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN a government profe&s;&s;edly <HI>free,</HI> that is a govern|ment of laws, binding on the whole by the con&s;ent of legal repre&s;entatives of the whole, it &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary that not only the laws them&s;elves, but what is called the practice of the law, &s;hould be better under&s;tood by the people at large.</P>
<P>IT is in vain for a per&s;on not ver&s;ed in the my|&s;teries of the profe&s;&s;ion to look into books of reports for the hi&s;tory of a trial at law. He may as well look for religion in the works of <HI>Jacob Behmen,</HI> or the practice of phy&s;ic in <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> He will find the &s;ubject matter concealed in technical jargon, and a cloud of artificial terms, to many of which profe&s;&s;ors them&s;elves have not yet a&s;&s;ign|ed a determinate meaning.</P>
<P>WHEN a law fir&s;t i&s;&s;ues from the hands of the legi&s;lature it is generally &s;ufficiently intelligible. It
<PB N="249" REF="024407_0642_0FC6F9C34DA32A48">
is like metal from the &s;melting furnace. But when it has undergone the operations of a judicial forge, it a&s;&s;umes appearances very different from its fir&s;t form. For law is the mo&s;t malleable thing in nature, and what with the heat of conte&s;t and the hammers of legal forms, it &s;oon becomes, in judicial con&s;truction, no more like the original than a bar of iron is like the pig of metal from which it has been forged.</P>
<P>I think it would be of con&s;iderable u&s;e, that this proce&s;s &s;hould be delineated at large; that the people may have an opportunity of knowing whe|ther their own acts are executed according to their &s;pirit and intent, and whether, what is called the common law, is fairly con&s;trued and applied in their courts of ju&s;tice, or not.</P>
<P>I know of no better way to effect this, than by recommending that all trials and law proceedings &s;hould be publi&s;hed in detail, with as &s;paring a u&s;e of mere profe&s;&s;ional language as po&s;&s;ible. The ca&s;e in conte&s;t &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;tated in as few and plain words as may be; and then &s;hould follow the whole proceedings of the court; the argu|ments of council; the interferences and opinions of the judges, &amp;c. all in <HI>dramatic</HI> form.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="024407_0643_0FC6F9C4CCDD26E0">TO elucidate my &s;cheme, I will attempt the re|port of a ca&s;e in the manner I think it ought to be done.</P>
<P>IT is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e that the ca&s;e I &s;hall &s;tate, the <HI>dramatis per&s;onae,</HI> and other cir|cum&s;tances, are altogether fictitious, and de&s;igned only as a mode for learned reporters in time to come.</P>

<HEAD>SPECIMEN OF A MODERN LAW-SUIT. THE CASE STATED.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LAWRENCE LANDLORD</HI> was &s;eized in fee of 300 acres of land: that is, it was his own e&s;tate. He lea&s;ed 100 acres thereof, together with a farm-hou&s;e, barn, orchard, &amp;c. to his neighbour <HI>Timothy Tenant,</HI> for a term of years, re&s;erving a certain rent, and covenanting for &s;eve|ral &s;pecific articles and privileges: among&s;t the&s;e was the following.</P>
<P><Q>AND it is hereby further agreed by and between the &s;aid parties, that the &s;aid <HI>Timothy Tenant</HI> &s;hall at all times, during the term of this pre&s;ent lea&s;e, pre&s;erve, keep, and &s;et apart for the u&s;e, benefit, and behoof, of the &s;aid <HI>Lawrence Landlord,</HI> the <HI>apple-&s;kins or parings of all the apples u&s;ed in the &s;aid Timothy

Tenant's family; to the intent and purpo&s;e that the &s;aid Lawrence Landlord may therewith feed, fatten, and rai&s;e up his pig or pigs</HI>: Provided always, that the &s;aid <HI>Lawrence Landlord,</HI> by him&s;elf or his &s;ervants, and at his own expence, co&s;t and trouble, &s;hall &s;end for, fetch, carry, or cau&s;e to be carried, away the apple-&s;kins or par|ings afore&s;aid, for the purpo&s;es afore&s;aid.</Q></P>
<P>AND &s;o it was, that under a con&s;truction of this clau&s;e, and by advice of council learned in the law, <HI>Lawrence Landlord</HI> had &s;ent for and taken away the APPLES growing in the orchard of <HI>Ti|mothy Tenant.</HI> Whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Timothy</HI>
brought his action of tre&s;pa&s;s, and &s;ued for damages for the wrong and injury done.</P>
<P>THIS cau&s;e had been in&s;tituted in the common-pleas, and gone through the ceremonials of many terms. At length, all objections being obviated, and all cau&s;es of delay removed, the defendant finding that the trial mu&s;t certainly come on, re|moved the cau&s;e, by <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> to a &s;uperior court.

<P>Here then, if the court plea&s;es, we join i&s;&s;ue. It is not pretended that we have in any in&s;tance violated the terms of our lea&s;e, or incurred any forfeiture. The clau&s;e in conte&s;t: is in the&s;e words:
<Q>And it is hereby further agreed by and between the &s;aid parties, that the &s;aid Timothy Tenant &s;hall at all times, during the term of this pre&s;ent lea&s;e, pre&s;erve, keep, and &s;et apart, for the u&s;e, benefit and behoof the &s;aid Lawrence Landlord, the apple-&s;kins, or parings, of all the apples u&s;ed in his, the &s;aid Timothy Tenant's family, to the intent and purpo&s;e, that the &s;aid Lawrence Landlord may therewith feed, fatten, and rai&s;e up his pig or pigs.

&s;olid argument, &s;upported by a <HI>cul-loud</HI> of autho|rities mo&s;t re&s;pectable in law, that by the word ap|ple-&s;kins and parings, <HI>the apples</HI> them&s;elves will pa&s;s by <HI>con-&s;tur-ruction</HI> of law and right rea&s;on.</P>
<P>NOW, if your honours plea&s;e, it is mo&s;t <HI>pul-lain</HI>
and manife&s;t, that the apple &s;kin cannot po&s;&s;i|bly be transferred, given or taken away, without the apple it&s;elf pa&s;&s;ing therewith. And why? For this <HI>pul-lain,</HI> and <HI>cul-lear</HI> rea&s;on, becau&s;e, if the apple-&s;kin or paring be &s;evered or &s;eparated from the apple, it is no longer an <HI>apple-&s;kin,</HI> but be|comes, in its &s;evered &s;tate, only the <HI>&s;kin of an ap|ple;</HI>
and &s;o &s;aith the law. Coke's Reports, Part II^n^d page 225, <Q>Severance of corn, is the cutting and carrying it off from the ground; and &s;ome|times, the &s;etting out the tithe from the re&s;t of the corn, is called <HI>&s;everance:</HI></Q>
mo&s;t <HI>cul-learly</HI>
then, the cutting the &s;kin from the apple, is a <HI>&s;e|verance;</HI>
and &s;uch a &s;everance as the law notices and recognizes. Gentlemen of the jury! I hope I am under&s;tood; this is a very important point. I &s;ay, there is a material difference between an apple &s;kin and the &s;kin of an apple. And, why? Becau&s;e a re&s;ervation of the apple-&s;kin is, by <HI>con&s;tur-ruction</HI> of law, a re&s;ervation of the apple it&s;elf. And, why? For this <HI>pul-lain</HI> and manife&s;t rea&s;on; becau&s;e, when the outward bounds, lines,

<P>BUT, may it plea&s;e your honours! I ha&s;ten to produce authorities directly in point: and fir&s;t, if the court plea&s;es, I will take up O'Farrell's Re|ports, page 106.</P>

<P>THIS was an action on the &s;tatute of <HI>Pa|trick</HI> 4^t^h chap. 16. called <HI>the &s;tatute of nails,</HI> which prohibits all &s;ubjects within the realm from cutting or paring their nails on a <HI>Friday:</HI>
under the penalty of twenty &s;hillings for every offence, to be recovered by the over&s;eers of the poor, for the u&s;e of the poor of the county in which the offence &s;hould be committed. <HI>Mi&s;|take</HI>
and others were over&s;eers of the poor for the county of <HI>Antrim,</HI> and brought their action under the &s;tatute again&s;t the defendant. And it was in proof that the defendant had pared his thumb nails and his great toe nails on <HI>Friday,</HI>
<PB N="262" REF="024407_0655_0FC6F9F3271ABA18">
to wit: on Friday, the&mdash; day of &mdash;, at twelve o'clock in the night of the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>COUNCIL for the defendant demurred to the facts; ob&s;erving, that as this was a penal law, it ought to be &s;trictly con&s;trued. And there|upon, took three points of defence, viz. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> it was urged, that <HI>night</HI> is not <HI>day,</HI> and the &s;ta|tute expre&s;sly &s;ays <HI>Fri-day</HI> and not <HI>Fri-night;</HI>
and the proof is, that the cutting was at night. <HI>Secondly,</HI> it was contended, that twelve o'clock on Friday night is in fact the beginning of Sa|turday morning, and therefore not within the &s;tatute. And, <HI>thirdly,</HI> that the words of the &s;ta|tute are UNGUES DIGITORUM&mdash;Anglici&mdash;<HI>the nails of the</HI> FINGERS, and the te&s;timony only re&s;|pects <HI>thumbs and great toes.</HI></P>
<P>THE jury gave in a &s;pecial verdict: whereup|on, after long advi&s;ement, the judges were una|nimou&s;ly of opinion, on the fir&s;t point, that in con&s;truction of law, day is night and night is day; becau&s;e a day con&s;i&s;ts of 24 hours, and the law will not allow of fractions of a day <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> minimi non curat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lex</HI>&mdash;in Engli&s;h, the law don't &s;tand upon trifles.

<P>NOW, may it plea&s;e the court, from this autho|rity it is <HI>mo&s;t cul-lear,</HI> that apple-&s;kins are ap|ples, and that apples are apple-&s;kins. I am confi|dent in &s;aying that the &s;malle&s;t particle of doubt cannot remain in the <HI>unpur-rejudiced</HI> mind. But to make the matter &s;till more <HI>cul-lear and pul-lain,</HI> as if it were po&s;&s;ible to demon&s;trate <HI>demon&s;tur|ration,</HI> here is an act of a&s;&s;embly&mdash;an act of our own government, which brings the matter home to the very door of the <HI>pur-re&s;ent</HI> ca&s;e. Acts of a&s;&s;embly, printed volume, page 314. This, if the court plea&s;es, is an act for laying an exci&s;e on cyder, and the words are "all apples or apple-&s;kins."&mdash;Now the article <HI>or</HI> is in this place neither conjunctive nor disjunctive, but <HI>pe-urly</HI>
explanatory: as if the law had &s;aid, all apples&mdash; or, which is the &s;ame thing, all apple-&s;kins.</P>
<P>HERE, Gentlemen of the jury, the legi&s;lature hath declared it&s;elf on the very point before the
<PB N="264" REF="024407_0657_0FC6F9FFDDEECBC8">
court. And it is <HI>cul-lear</HI> as the &s;un at noon day when not a <HI>cul-loud</HI> is to be &s;een in the &s;ky, that apple-&s;kins or parings and the apples them&s;elves are, in <HI>con&s;tur-ruction</HI> of law, one and the &s;ame thing. And it follows, as undeniably as a <HI>pur-obl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI>
in Euclid, that when the pre&s;ent le&s;&s;or re&s;erved the apple-&s;kins or parings, he, at one and the &s;ame time, re&s;erved the apples al&s;o for his u&s;e, or ra|ther, as the contract <HI>expur-re&s;&s;es</HI> it, for the u&s;e of his pig or pigs.</P>
<P>FOR what would be the con&s;equence, may it plea&s;e the court&mdash;what would be the con&s;equence of any other con&s;truction? If the le&s;&s;ee &s;hould eat the apples him&s;elf, would this fatten the le&s;&s;or's pigs? Surely not&mdash;Would the dumplins and ap|ple-pyes of the <HI>pul-laintiff's</HI> children fatten the de|fendant's pigs? Surely not&mdash;Would the cyder made by Timothy Tenant rai&s;e up the pigs of Law|rence Landlord? Surely not&mdash;Does the clau&s;e in the lea&s;e &s;ay that the tenant &s;hall have all the apples, and leave only the &s;kins of apples for the landlord? It &s;ays no &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>WITH the leave of the court, I will put a ca&s;e&mdash;Suppo&s;e a miller hath a &s;ack of meal: I a&s;k him what he will take for that &s;ack, and we agree
<PB N="265" REF="024407_0658_0FC6FA0110AD97A0">
for twenty &s;hillings. After the agreement, and after I have paid the &s;tipulated price, the <HI>cur-rafty</HI>
miller may as well empty out the meal and give me the void &s;ack for my money, as that the <HI>pul-laintiff,</HI> in the <HI>pur-re&s;ent</HI> cau&s;e, &s;hould be en|titled by this honourable court to eat the apples him&s;elf, and give only the &s;kins of apples to the de|fendant.</P>
<P>GENTLMEN of the jury! this is a cau&s;e of <HI>gur-reat</HI>
magnitude, no le&s;s than determining by &s;olemn adjudication the di&s;tinction between an apple-&s;kin and the &s;kin of an apple. But I have the fulle&s;t confidence that this enlightened court and jury, will &s;ee as <HI>cul-lear</HI> as the &s;un when not a &s;ingle <HI>cul-loud</HI> intervenes, that the &s;kin of an apple is or may be the &s;kin of any apple; but an apple-&s;kin is the &s;kin of a known and determinate apple; an|nexed to and circum&s;cribing that apple; being in truth the <HI>pars continens</HI> thereof. As if one &s;hould take an apple in his hand, and &s;ay&mdash;<HI>this,</HI> pointing to the part, (having cut the apple in half) is the apple &s;eed&mdash;<HI>this,</HI> (&s;till pointing to the re&s;|pective parts,) is the apple-core&mdash;<HI>this,</HI> is the ap|ple pulp&mdash;and <HI>this,</HI> (&s;till pointing,) is the apple &s;kin&mdash;the <HI>pars continens</HI> of the whole; and &s;o, altogether, viz, &s;eed, core, pulp and &s;kin, make
<PB N="266" REF="024407_0659_0FC6FA022D4B3ED0">
up a full and <HI>com-pul-lete</HI> apple&mdash;or, as the law would expre&s;s it, an apple-&s;kin <HI>pars pro toto</HI>&mdash;for the law delighteth in brevity.</P>
<P>MAY it plea&s;e the court, I come now, in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, to an&s;wer an argument which may be brought on the other &s;ide, founded on the&s;e words in the clau&s;e under con&s;ideration: <Q>Of all the apples <HI>u&s;ed</HI> in his the &s;aid Timothy Tenant's family.</Q>
And here, mo&s;t <HI>pur-robably,</HI> the gen|tleman of council for the <HI>pul-laintiff,</HI> will ob&s;erve with his u&s;ual ingenuity, that the&s;e words &s;trongly indicate a &s;everance to be intended. Otherwi&s;e, as he will &s;ay, how &s;hall the apples be u&s;ed in the family of the le&s;&s;ee, if, under the term <HI>apple-&s;kins,</HI> the whole, that is, both &s;kins and apples are re|&s;erved to the le&s;&s;or?</P>
<P>SUCH an argument might have weight with a le&s;s enlightened jury than that I have the honour now to addre&s;s. But let us <HI>bur-ring</HI> this &s;eeming rea&s;on to the te&s;t of law, that unerring rule of right, that apex, &s;ummit, and perfection of human rea&s;on, and we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee the mi&s;t of error va|ni&s;h, and the <HI>cul-lear</HI> &s;un of truth <HI>bur-reak</HI> forth with unrivalled <HI>ur-radiance.</HI></P>
<P>THE words are:
<Q>of all the apples <HI>u&s;ed</HI> in his
<PB N="267" REF="024407_0660_0FC6FA03B8691DC8">
(the <HI>pul-laintiff's</HI>) family.</Q>
We will now con|&s;ider, if the court plea&s;es, the doctrine of USES, as laid down in the books. And here it is to be ob|&s;erved, that the <HI>habendum</HI> of every deed con&s;i&s;ts of two limitations; the one of e&s;tate or property which the feoffee, or party po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ive, &s;hall receive by the deed; and the other the limitation of the <HI>u&s;e</HI> or <HI>u&s;es</HI>: that is, for who&s;e u&s;e he &s;hall hold the property: by which means the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is in one man, and the u&s;e or <HI>pur-rofit</HI> in another. And for this, I turn to <HI>Gilbert's</HI> law of u&s;es, page 175.
<Q>An u&s;e, at common law, was an equitable right which he re&s;erved, who conveyed a legal e&s;tate to another; upon tru&s;t and confidence, that the per&s;on to whom he &s;o conveyed it, would ne|verthele&s;s &s;uffer him to take the rents and profits of the land.</Q></P>
<P>HERE then it is <HI>pul-lain</HI> to demon&s;tration, that the le&s;&s;or, the defendant in the <HI>pur-re&s;ent</HI> cau&s;e, hath re&s;erved the <HI>pur-rofits</HI> or <HI>fur-ruits</HI> of the land although he has lea&s;ed the &s;oil it&s;elf to the <HI>pul-laintiff.</HI> And how has he done this? Not by re|&s;erving the apples <HI>gur-rowing</HI> on the premi&s;es. This would have been equivocal and uncertain, as the vulgar tongue for the mo&s;t part is. And why? Becau&s;e it is not certain and determinate what an
<PB N="268" REF="024407_0661_0FC6FA0CC84B5250">
apple is&mdash;There are <HI>fur-ruits,</HI> which in common parlance are called <HI>oak-apples;</HI> others <HI>bal&s;am ap|ples;</HI> others <HI>crab-apples,</HI> and &s;o forth: and even potatoes are denominated <HI>les pommes de terre;</HI> that is, <HI>earth apples;</HI> or, as &s;ome tran&s;late it, <HI>the apples of the earth.</HI> How, I &s;ay, has the le&s;&s;or made his re&s;ervation? Not by re&s;erving the &s;kins of apples; for then <HI>ce&s;tuy que u&s;e,</HI> the le&s;&s;or's pigs would have nothing but the offals, the excrementitious parts of the <HI>fur-ruit</HI> to fatten on. But he has, with <HI>tur-rue</HI> legal preci&s;ion, re&s;erved the apple-&s;kins which include the apples them&s;elves; as the metes and boundaries of a tract of land <HI>incul-lude</HI> and convey the land it&s;elf, with all its buildings, <HI>im|pur-rovements</HI> and appurtenances. And why? Becau&s;e by a maxim of law, <HI>cujus e&s;t &s;olum ejus e&s;t u&s;que ad coelum.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to return to the doctrine of u&s;es&mdash;<HI>Gilbert's</HI> law of u&s;es page 26:
<Q>Though at common law <HI>ce&s;tuy que u&s;e</HI> had no power over the land, yet he might alien the u&s;e; becau&s;e every one might di&s;po&s;e of the rights that are in him.</Q></P>
<P>HERE then, if your honours plea&s;e! we &s;ee, that the le&s;&s;or, the <HI>pur-re&s;ent</HI> defendant, hath a power, not only to u&s;e the apples him&s;elf, but
<PB N="269" REF="024407_0662_0FC6FA10671975E0">
might, if he &s;o thought fit, &s;ell or di&s;po&s;e of them to another. <HI>A fortiori</HI> &s;hall he give them to his own pigs. And why? Becau&s;e, &s;aith this <HI>bur-right</HI> luminary of law, <HI>Baron Gilbert,</HI>
<Q>Every man may di&s;po&s;e of the right that is in him</Q></P>
<P>MAY it plea&s;e the court, I could go on, op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> up, and di&s;play the whole doctrine of tru&s;ts and u&s;es, as laid down in the books; and, at every &s;tep, it would appear <HI>cul-lear, cul-learer,</HI> and &s;till more <HI>cul-lear,</HI> that the words of the contract, "u&s;ed in his family," are, by intendment of law, to be con&s;idered as meaning no more than a naked po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in tru&s;t for <HI>ce&s;tuy que u&s;e</HI> the defendant's pigs.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall not take up the time of this honour|able court, by heaping proof upon proof, or in attempts to elucidate the <HI>ur-radiance</HI> of the &s;un.</P>
<P>I confidently &s;ubmit the defendant's cau&s;e to the court and jury: having, as I hope, quench|ed every &s;cintilla of doubt in the <HI>unpur-rejudiced</HI> mind.</P>

<P>THE legal con&s;truction and operation of a clau&s;e of re&s;ervation in a lea&s;e granted by the defendant to the plaintiff, is the &s;ole point on which the de|termination of this cau&s;e mu&s;t depend. The re|&s;erve made, is,
<Q>of the apple-&s;kins or parings of all the apples u&s;ed in his, the &s;aid Timothy Te|nant's, family; to the intent and purpo&s;e, that the &s;aid Lawrence Landlord may therewith feed, fatten, and rai&s;e up his pig or pigs.</Q></P>
<P>THE di&s;tinction between an apple-&s;kin and the &s;kin of an apple was well &s;upported by the coun|cil for the defendant.

<P>BUT to the point. This lea&s;e or contract, is a deed; and deeds are to be con&s;idered with re&s;pect to their <HI>form</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;tance:</HI> as to the fir&s;t, it is not contended but that this deed is regular in point of <HI>form.</HI> Let us then con&s;ider the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance.</HI> The &s;ub&s;tance of any deed is the intention of the par|ties, at the time of executing it.

<P>&rindx; IN December 1778 the convention of Penn&s;ylvania a&s;&s;em|bled to con&s;ider the con&s;titution or frame of government for the United States, drawn up by the late general convention of the &s;tates, and by them recommended to the con&s;ideration of the people at large. After three weeks deliberation, the propo&s;ed con&s;titution was adopted by the convention of Penn&s;ylvania, by a majority of two thirds of that body. The following allegory contains in &s;ub&s;tance the principal arguments u&s;ed in that important debate.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="allegory">
<HEAD>THE NEW ROOF.</HEAD>
<P>THE roof a certain Man&s;ion-hou&s;e was ob&s;erv|ed to be in a very bad condition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The old Confederation.</NOTE>, and quite in|&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e of protection from the in|clemencies of the weather. This was matter of &s;urpri&s;e and &s;peculation, as it was well known that the roof was not more than twelve years old, and therefore its defects could not be a&s;cribed to a na|tural decay by time.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there were many different opinions re&s;pecting the cau&s;es of this deficiency, yet all agreed that the family could not &s;leep in comfort or &s;afety under it.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="024407_0677_0FC6FA4ADC71C0E8">AT la&s;t it was determined to employ &s;ome &s;kilful architects to &s;urvey and examine this defective roof, to make report of its condition, and to point out &s;uch alterations and repairs as might be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THESE &s;kilful architects accordingly met toge|ther; and after a thorough examination of the faulty roof, they found,</P>
<P N="1">1^s^t That the whole fabric was too weak.</P>
<P N="2">2^n^d That there were indeed <HI>thirteen</HI> rafters; but that the&s;e rafters were not connected by any braces or ties, &s;o as to form a union of &s;trength.</P>
<P N="3">3^d That &s;ome of the&s;e rafters were thick and heavy, and others too &s;light; and as the whole had been put together whil&s;t the timber was yet green, &s;ome had warped outwards, and of cour&s;e &s;u&s;tain|ed an undue proportion of weight, whil&s;t others, warping inwards, had &s;hrunk from bearing any weight at all.</P>
<P N="4">4^t^h THAT the &s;hingling and lathing had not been &s;ecured with iron nails, but only wooden pegs<NOTE PLACE="foot">Paper Currency.</NOTE>, which &s;welling and &s;hrinking by &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of wet
<PB N="284" REF="024407_0678_0FC6FA51422360E8">
and dry weather, had left the &s;hingles &s;o loo&s;e, that many of them had been blown away by the wind; and that before long, the whole would, probably, in like manner be blown away.</P>
<P N="5">5^t^h THAT the cornice was &s;o ill proportioned, and &s;o badly put up, as to be neither an ornament nor of u&s;e: and,</P>
<P N="6">6^t^h That the roof was &s;o flat as to admit the mo&s;t idle &s;ervants in the family, their playmates and acquaintance, to trample upon and abu&s;e it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Want of dignity in government.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING made the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the&s;e judici|ous architects were of opinion, that it would be altogether vain and fruitle&s;s to attempt any altera|tions or repairs in a roof &s;o defective in all points, and therefore propo&s;ed to have it entirely remov|ed; and that a new roof, of a better con&s;truction, &s;hould be erected over the man&s;ion-hou&s;e: and they al&s;o prepared a drawing or plan of a new roof, &s;uch as they thought mo&s;t excellent for &s;e|curity, duration, and ornament. In forming this plan, they con&s;ulted the mo&s;t celebrated authors in ancient and modern architecture, and brought into their de&s;ign the mo&s;t approved parts, &s;elected from the models before them; and finally endeavoured
<PB N="285" REF="024407_0679_0FC6FA540E4CB4A0">
to proportion the whole to the &s;ize of the building, and the &s;trength of the walls.</P>
<P>THIS propo&s;al of a new roof, it may well be imagined, became the principal &s;ubject of conver|&s;ation in the family: and the opinions of it were various, according to the judgment, intere&s;ts, or ignorance of the di&s;putants.</P>
<P>ON a certain day the &s;ervants of the family had a&s;&s;embled in the great hall to di&s;cu&s;s the important que&s;tion. Among&s;t the&s;e was JAMES,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">J&mdash; W&mdash;, e&s;q.</NOTE> the archi|tect, who had been one of the &s;urveyors of the old roof, and had a principal hand in forming the plan of the new one. A great number of tenants had al&s;o gathered out of doors, and crowded the win|dows and avenues to the hall, which were left open for them, that they might hear the arguments for and again&s;t the new roof.</P>
<P>NOW, there was an old woman, known by the name of <HI>Margery the midwife,</HI> who had got a comfortable apartment in the man&s;ion-hou&s;e. This woman was of an intriguing &s;pirit, of a re&s;tle&s;s and inveterate temper, fond of tattle, and a great mi&s;|chief-maker. In this &s;ituation, and with the&s;e ta|lents,
<PB N="286" REF="024407_0680_0FC6FA561E0F7AF8">
&s;he unavoidably acquired an influence in the family; by the exerci&s;e of which, according to her natural propen&s;ity, &s;he had long kept the hou&s;e in confu&s;ion, and &s;own di&s;cord and di&s;content among&s;t the &s;ervants.</P>
<P><HI>MARGERY</HI> was, for many rea&s;ons, an irrecon|cilable enemy to the new roof, and the artichects who had contrived it. Among&s;t the&s;e, two rea|&s;ons were very obvious. Fir&s;t: the mantle-piece, on which her cups and platters were placed, was made of a portion of the great cornice; and &s;he boiled her pot with the &s;hingles that blew off from the defective roof: and, &s;econdly, it &s;o happened that, in the con&s;truction of the new roof, her apart|ment would be con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner, therefore, did &s;he hear of the plan propo&s;ed by the architects, but &s;he put on her old red cloak, and was day and night trudging among&s;t the &s;ervants and tenants, crying out again&s;t the new roof, and the framers thereof. Among&s;t the&s;e &s;he had &s;elected <HI>William, Jack,</HI> and <HI>Robert,</HI> three of the &s;ervants, and in&s;tigated them to oppo&s;e the plan recommended. She cau&s;ed them to be &s;ent to the great hall on the day of debate, and furni&s;h|ed
<PB N="287" REF="024407_0681_0FC6FA579BFBC1E0">
them with innumerable alarms and fears, cun|ning arguments, and &s;pecious objections.</P>
<P>NOW, the principal argument and objections with which <HI>Margery</HI> had in&s;tructed William, Jack, and Robert, were the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1^s^t THAT the architects had not exhibited a bill of &s;cantling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bill of rights.</NOTE> for the new roof, as they ought to have done; and, therefore, the carpenters, under the pretence of providing timber for it, might lay wa&s;te whole fore&s;ts, to the ruin of the farm.</P>
<P N="2">2^d^l^y THAT no provi&s;ion was made in the plan for a trap door <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Liberty of the pre&s;s.</NOTE> for the &s;ervants to pa&s;s through with water, if the chimney &s;hould take fire, and that in ca&s;e of &s;uch an accident it might hereafter be deemed penal to break a hole in the roof, for acce&s;s, to &s;ave the whole building from de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="3">3^d^l^y THAT this roof was to be guarded by battlements<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Standing army.</NOTE>, which in &s;tormy &s;ea&s;ons, would prove dangerous to the family, as the bricks might be blown down and fall on their heads.</P>
<P N="4">4^t^h^l^y IT was ob&s;erved, that the old roof was or|namented
<PB N="288" REF="024407_0682_0FC6FA63126A8210">
with twelve pede&s;tals, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trial by jury.</NOTE> ranged along the ridge, which had been objects of univer&s;al ad|miration. Whereas, according to the new plan, the&s;e pede&s;tals were only to be placed along the eaves of the roof over the walls. As to the cu|pola, &s;ome of the objectors &s;aid it was too heavy, and would prove a dangerous burden to the build|ing; whil&s;t others in&s;i&s;ted that it was too light, and would certainly be blown away by the wind</P>
<P N="5">5^t^h^l^y IT was urged, that the thirteen rafters would be &s;o &s;trongly braced together, that the individual and &s;eparate &s;trength of each rafter would be lo&s;t in the compounded and united &s;trength of the whole <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That the &s;overeignties of the &s;everal &s;tates would be ab&s;orbed in the general government.</NOTE> and &s;o this roof might be con&s;idered as one &s;olid ma&s;s of timber, and not as compo&s;ed of di&s;tinct rafters like the old roof.</P>
<P N="6">6^t^h^l^y THAT, according to the propo&s;ed plan, the &s;everal parts of the roof were &s;o framed as to mutually &s;trengthen and &s;upport each other; and therefore, there was great rea&s;on to fear, that the whole might &s;tand independent of the walls;
<PB N="305" REF="024407_0683_0FC6FA64698C7980">
and, that in time the walls might moulder away, and the roof remain &s;u&s;pended in the air, threaten|ing de&s;truction to all who &s;hould come under it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That it would be a con&s;olidated government, and might exi&s;t independent of the people or of the &s;tates.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e objections, JAMES, the architect, in &s;ub&s;tance replied.</P>
<P N="1">1^s^t AS to the want of a bill of &s;cantling, he ob|&s;erved, that if the timber for this roof was to be purcha&s;ed from a &s;tranger, it would have been quite proper to have &s;uch a bill, le&s;t the &s;tranger &s;hould charge in account more than he was en|titled to; but as the timber was to be cut from our own lands, a bill of &s;cantling was both u&s;ele&s;s and improper. It was of no u&s;e, becau&s;e the wood always was, and always would be, the pro|perty of the family, whether growing in the fo|re&s;t, or fabricated into a roof for the man&s;ion-hou&s;e; and improper, becau&s;e the carpenters would be bound by the bill of &s;cantling; which, if it &s;hould not be perfectly accurate, a circum|&s;tance not to be expected, either the roof would be defective for want of &s;ufficient materials, or the carpenters mu&s;t cut from the fore&s;t, without au|thority, which is penal by the laws of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="306" REF="024407_0684_0FC6FA660F626E48">2^d^l^y TO the &s;econd objection, he &s;aid, that a trap-door was not properly a part in the frame of a roof; but there could be no doubt but that the carpenters would take care to make &s;uch a door in the &s;hingling for the family to carry water through, <HI>dirty</HI> or <HI>clean,</HI> to extingui&s;h fire, either in the chimney or on the roof; and that this was the only proper way of making &s;uch a door.</P>
<P N="3">3^d^l^y AS to the battlements, he in&s;i&s;ted, that they were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the protection of the whole hou&s;e. 1^s^t Becau&s;e, in ca&s;e of a &s;udden attack by robbers, the family could defend them&s;elves behind the&s;e battlements, and annoy and di&s;per&s;e the enemy. 2^d^l^y If any of the ad|joining buildings &s;hould take fire, the battlements would &s;creen the roof from the de&s;tructive flames. And, 3^d^l^y, they would retain the rafters in their re&s;pective places, in ca&s;e any of them &s;hould, from rottenne&s;s or warping, be in danger of fall|ing from the general union, and injuring the other parts of the roof: ob&s;erving al&s;o, that the battle|ments &s;hould always be ready for the&s;e purpo&s;es, as there would be neither time nor opportunity for rai&s;ing battlements after an a&s;&s;ault was actually made, or a conflagration begun. As to the bricks being blown down, and falling on the heads of the people, he &s;aid the whole would always be in
<PB N="307" REF="024407_0685_0FC6FA6E54069E10">
the power of the family, who could at any time repair or remove any loo&s;e and dangerous parts; and there could be no doubt but that their vigi|lance would be fully &s;ufficient to prevent accidents of this kind.</P>
<P N="4">4^t^h^l^y WITH re&s;pect to the twelve pede&s;tals, he acknowledged their u&s;e and beauty; but ob&s;erved that the&s;e, like all other things, were only &s;o in their proper places, and under circum&s;tances &s;uit|ed to their nature and de&s;ign: and he in&s;i&s;ted that the ridge of a roof was not the place for pede|&s;tals, which &s;hould re&s;t on the &s;olid wall, being made of the &s;ame materials; and ought, in propri|ety, to be con&s;idered as &s;o many projections, or continuations of the wall it&s;elf, and not as compo|nent parts of the wooden roof. As to the cupola, he &s;aid, that all agreed that there &s;hould be one of &s;ome kind or other; as well for a proper fini&s;h to the building, as for the purpo&s;e of indicating the winds, and containing a bell to &s;ound the alarm in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity. The objections to the propo&s;ed cupola, he &s;aid, were too contradictory to merit a reply.</P>
<P N="5">5^t^h^l^y TO the fifth objection, he an&s;wered: that the intention really was to make a firm and &s;ub|&s;tantial roof, by uniting the &s;trength of the thirteen rafters: but that this was &s;o far from annihilating
<PB N="308" REF="024407_0686_0FC6FA70795F9B58">
the &s;everal rafters, and rendering them of no u&s;e individually, that it was manife&s;t, from a bare in&s;pection of the plan, that the &s;trength of each contributed to the &s;trength of the whole, and that the exi&s;tence of each and all was e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of the fabric as a roof.</P>
<P N="6">6^t^h^l^y AND la&s;tly, he &s;aid, that the roof was, in truth, &s;o framed as that the parts &s;hould mutually &s;upport and check each other. But it was ab&s;o|lutely ab&s;urd, and contrary to the known laws of nature, to infer from thence, that the whole frame could &s;tand &s;elf-&s;upported in the air. For, how|ever its component parts might be combined with re&s;pect to each other, the whole mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;t upon and be &s;upported by the walls. That the walls might, indeed, &s;tand for a few years in a ruinous and uninhabitable condition, without any roof; but the roof could not, for a moment, &s;tand without the &s;upport of the walls: and finally, that of all dangers and apprehen&s;ions, this of the roof's remaining after the walls are gone, was the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>IT may be a&s;&s;erted with confidence, that be&s;ides the petitions that Mr. Whitehill pre&s;ented to the convention, from Cumberland county, again&s;t the adoption of the new con&s;titution, there is not a county or town in the &s;tate that &s;hould not have followed the example, if a rea&s;onable time had been allowed for the petitions to come in.

Where is that pu&s;illanimous wretch that can &s;ub|mit to this contumely? Is not this the language of Britain in the years 1775 and 1776 renewed?

If it be; then I &s;ay that the impro|priety con&s;i&s;ted only in their not <HI>demanding</HI> them.

<P>I Received your letter by Mr ***** and am very &s;orry to find that your exertions in the county of ***** have been attended with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s. I expected long before this to have heard of a commotion begun. It is indeed high time that &s;omething vigorous &s;hould be attempted, other|wi&s;e the &s;pirit of our cau&s;e will langui&s;h, and when once that &s;pirit hath evaporated it will not be in our power to recal it.</P>
<P>YOU know it was always our opinion, that the great gun &s;hould be charged here in the city, and

In &s;hort, I am almo&s;t weary of this fruitle&s;s toil. I don't find that my publications have had the de&s;ired effect here; I would fain hope that they have been more operative in the counties; if &s;o, you &s;hould have informed me, for I want encourage|ment more than a &s;pur.</P>
<P>WHILST I am i&s;&s;uing number after number of my Centinel, all written with a freedom and &s;pirit &s;ufficient, one would think, to rou&s;e the people; I &s;ay, whil&s;t I am doing this, the &s;tates, one after another, either unanimou&s;ly, or by very large ma|jorities, are ratifying the new con&s;titution.

<P>THE novelty of this boldne&s;s is over, and my pieces are now &s;carcely read. I am a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;uch extraordinary exertions have had &s;o lit|tle effect with the people. I have directly, and without re&s;erve, called the members of the late ge|neral convention, with general W&mdash;n at their head, villians, traitors, fools and con&s;pirators, col|lectively and individually, and yet the mob does not ri&s;e. I have often told you, that it is of no great importance on which &s;ide an in&s;urrection takes place&mdash;all that is nece&s;&s;ary, is to have a commotion begun. A faction can always turn public confu&s;ion to its own account. I was in great hopes that the attack upon Major Boyd's hou&s;e would have produced &s;omething; it was indeed &s;erviceable to our party, but the flame was too weak to &s;pread; the law interfered and ex|tingui&s;hed it entirely. A mob is not worth a far|thing, unle&s;s, by its great numbers, or the weight and influence of its leaders, it can &s;toutly look law in the face, and bid defiance to its operation.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="024407_0704_0FC6F7B198CAD510">YOU tell me that you have enli&s;ted about 60 in|&s;urgents&mdash;but what can they do? 600 in each of the counties would have been more to the purpo&s;e. Either you mu&s;t have been very negligent, or your influence in the county is not as great as you gave us rea&s;on to believe.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay you have con&s;tantly attended at ta|verns, vendues, funerals and other public meetings &mdash;liberally treated tho&s;e whom your thought it might be of u&s;e to gain&mdash;di&s;tributed my Centinels, and watched the mo&s;t favourable opportunities for inflaming the minds of the people. This is all ve|ry well; but if the con&s;equence has been no more than the a&s;&s;ociation of 60 in&s;urgents, it is certainly very poor doings. If our friends have done no better in the other counties, and I have not yet heard that they have done any thing, our party had better tack about, and cry up the new con&s;ti|tution, that &s;ome of us may &s;tand a chance at lea&s;t for a &s;hare in the loaves and fi&s;hes. For if, notwith&s;tanding our oppo&s;ition, this new con&s;ti|tution &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, we &s;hall always be looked upon as di&s;affected to the government, and unfit to be tru&s;ted with offices under it.</P>
<P>OUR champions in the other &s;tates begin to fall off. You have &s;een, I &s;uppo&s;e, governor R&mdash;'s
<PB N="327" REF="024407_0705_0FC6F7BA1B9E1180">
letter; and I am told, that R&mdash; H&mdash; L&mdash; and Mr. M&mdash; have dropped all oppo&s;ition. Un|le&s;s &s;ome extraordinary exertions are made, and &s;peedily too, our whole &s;cheme mu&s;t fall to the ground. Only imagine what a ridiculous figure I make here. I am every week publi&s;hing things, which, in any other country would bring the au|thor to the gallows, as a &s;editious di&s;turber of the public peace&mdash;and yet nothing comes of it. My performances, as I &s;aid before, do not even provoke a reply. Can any thing be more mortifying? In the mean time, the new con&s;titution is taking root in the other &s;tates. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in every in&s;tance where the people have been legally brought together, either in conventions, or as a&s;&s;emblymen, grand juries&punc; or otherwi&s;e, they have uniformly declared them&s;elves in favour of it. The&s;e are great ob&s;tacles to our views. We have affected the popular &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and the voice of the people is decidedly again&s;t us. Pa|trioti&s;m, not &s;upported by the body, the citizens is always denominated <HI>faction.</HI></P>
<P>TO conclude, unle&s;s we can do &s;omething &s;peedily, towards rai&s;ing a re&s;pectable commotion in the &s;tate, it is my opinion that we ought to prepare for join|ing the general current in favour of this new &s;y&s;tem of government: and this may be plau&s;ibly effected by
<PB N="328" REF="024407_0706_0FC6F7BE2927A8E8">
declaring that we never had any thing in view but the good of our country: that the new con&s;tituti|on appeared, in our judgments, to contain many things objectionable, and &s;ome things even danger|ous, to the liberties of the people. But as the ge|neral opinion &s;eems to be otherwi&s;e, we re&s;ign our prejudices to the will of the majority, as every good citizen ought to do: and &s;ince we find that the propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of a federal government is indeed likely to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, we &s;hall not be behind any in zealous exertions for its &s;upport.</P>
<P>THINK of the&s;e things, and let me hear from you as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. In the mean time,</P>

<P>AFTER mature di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the &s;ociety unanimou&s;|ly agreed in the following FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t <HI>Pure natural liberty,</HI> is the right of every man to do whatever he plea&s;es <HI>without controul,</HI>

and to po&s;&s;e&s;s, <HI>without retribution,</HI> whatever he can acquire by his <HI>valour</HI> or <HI>addre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2^d STATES or &s;overeign powers are as indivi|duals in a &s;tate of nature; and therefore true <HI>political liberty,</HI> or the liberty of a &s;tate as a body politic, is the right of that &s;tate, or of tho&s;e who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;overeignty thereof, to do &s;uch things, and enact &s;uch laws, as may be thought conducive to the advancement of the powers and intere&s;ts of that &s;tate, or of the government thereof, uncontrouled by the artificial &s;y&s;tem of re&s;traints, known by the name of the <HI>law of nations.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3^d ALL &s;y&s;tems of government, whether ope|rating on &s;tates, or on individuals, although o&s;|ten&s;ibly formed, and &s;peciou&s;ly declared to be for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of general ju&s;tice and of general good, ought to be abhorred by the true &s;ons of freedom as inva&s;ions on, and abridgments of their natural rights.</P>
<P N="4">4th WHEREAS in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of things, <HI>true natural liberty,</HI> as defined in our fir&s;t fundamental principle, cannot be univer&s;ally enjoyed, nece&s;&s;ity enforces a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to what is called government, under &s;ome form or other.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="331" REF="024407_0709_0FC6F7C2244DCED8">5^t^h ACCORDING to the foregoing principles, <HI>that</HI> form of government is the be&s;t which con|tains the fewe&s;t re&s;traints, and leaves in the hand of the governed the greate&s;t portion of <HI>natural liberty,</HI> and the fulle&s;t &s;cope for the exerci&s;e of <HI>per&s;onal prowe&s;s</HI> and <HI>native ingenuity,</HI> it being demon&s;trable, that if the component parts of any &s;ociety are left free, and become, <HI>by any means,</HI> rich and happy, the whole of that &s;ociety will be free, rich and happy.</P>
<P N="6">6th THE wor&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible governments is that in which the vigorous operation of general laws, and a complication of internal checks, re|&s;traints and regulations, prevent individual &s;tates or per&s;ons from pur&s;uing their &s;eparate intere&s;t <HI>in their own way</HI>; mo&s;t wickedly &s;acrificing the real emolument of individuals to the vi&s;ionary good and pro&s;perity of the whole.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>fundamental principles</HI> being e&s;tabli&s;hed, the plan of government propo&s;ed by the late gene|ral convention for the United States was taken up; con&s;idered by paragraphs, and compared with the doctrines laid down; and after &s;ome debate the following re&s;olutions were unanimou&s;ly adop|ted. viz.</P>

<P N="2">2^d RESOLVED, That under &s;uch a government, neither &s;tates nor individuals can do, or refu&s;e to do, whatever they plea&s;e in all ca&s;es; which is a direct infringement on the natural liberty of both, as defined in our fir&s;t fundamental principle.</P>

<P N="5"><PB N="333" REF="024407_0711_0FC6F7CCAFB2B180">5^t^h RESOLVED, That under &s;uch a government, the indu&s;trious and wealthy may enjoy their pro|perty in &s;ecurity, to the great injury of tho&s;e who have no property at all.</P>

<HEAD>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE <HI>DISEASES</HI> OF THE <HI>MIND</HI>; WITH A SCHEME FOR PURGING THE MORAL FACULTIES OF THE <HI>GOOD PEOPLE</HI> OF <HI>PENNSYLVANIA.</HI> QUITE NEW AND VERY PHILOSOPHICAL.</HEAD>
<P>THAT there is an intimate connection between the &s;oul and the body, and that the one is apt to be affected by the di&s;orders and irregularities of the other, is a truth too manife&s;t to be controverted. How this connection is formed, to what extent it ex|i&s;ts, and what are the vi&s;ible organs of the body which compo&s;e the intermediate links of union, with
<PB N="337" REF="024407_0715_0FC6F7DA4B8CF478">
the invi&s;ible faculties of the mind, are problems which have been often in vain attempted. I neither pretend to have found out the &s;ecret, nor have I, at pre&s;ent, any plau&s;ible hypothe&s;is to propo&s;e on this delicate &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THIS mutual influence, however, which plainly exi&s;ts between &s;pirit and matter in all animals, and more e&s;pecially in man, hath produced many pro|mi&s;ing devices for remedying the di&s;orders of the mind, which &s;eem to be beyond our reach, by at|tacking the organs of the body, which are within our power. A late ingenious author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ru&s;h.</NOTE> has gone great lengths in this hypothe&s;is, in his "<HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on the effect of phy&s;ical cau&s;es on the moral faculty.</HI>"</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I believe there is &s;ome truth in the doctrine; and that, in particular ca&s;es, if applied with great judgment, a partial and tempo|rary effect may be obtained. But if the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould really be in the mind, it will be in vain to expect a <HI>radical</HI> cure, by medical attacks on the body, which can do no more than for the pre|&s;ent deprive the mind of the in&s;truments by which &s;he exhibits her di&s;tempered faculties.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;tance: &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on to be of an ira&s;|cible,
<PB N="338" REF="024407_0716_0FC6F7E179214650">
captious di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ubject to violent and ungovernable gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion. To reduce his body by phlebotomy, emetics, cathartics, a &s;lender regi|men, &amp;c. would probably produce a dejection of &s;pirits, and an apparent calmne&s;s of temper. But mu&s;t this man be kept all his life time in a &s;tate of debility? For there is no doubt but that as &s;oon as health and vigour are allowed to return, the angry di&s;po&s;itions will return too, and perhaps with en|crea&s;ed inveteracy, on account of the re&s;triction. So, al&s;o, if I &s;hould be infected with a trouble&s;ome itch for &s;cribbling&mdash;which heaven forbid! and my friends, with a view to a cure, &s;hould deprive me of pen, ink, and paper. For the pre&s;ent, to be &s;ure, I could not &s;cribble: but would the itch be removed?&mdash;Far from it&mdash;the &s;cribbling matter being refu&s;ed a di&s;charge, would accumulate, and become more virulent: and &s;o &s;oon as the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments or organs of exhibition could be pro|cured, I &s;hould &s;cribble wor&s;e than ever.</P>
<P>THIS &s;cheme of whipping the mind over the bo|dy's &s;houlders will not, I apprehend, an&s;wer any permanent purpo&s;e: and I know of no well au|thenticated ca&s;es in &s;upport of the doctrine. Hath government ever cured a propen&s;ity to theft by the admini&s;tration of the whipping-po&s;t or the wheel-barrow? Among&s;t the innumerable experi|ments
<PB N="339" REF="024407_0717_0FC6F7E26ED0F088">
that have been made, I never heard of one &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;tance&mdash;No; it &s;eems more natural, that mental remedies &s;hould be pre&s;cribed for mental di&s;orders; and corporeal phy&s;ic for bodily di&s;ea&s;es. Let there be phy&s;icians and metaphy&s;icians as two di&s;tinct profe&s;&s;ions. I do not mean by <HI>metaphy&s;icians,</HI> &s;uch as are now profe&s;&s;ors in univer&s;ities and col|leges; but <HI>practi&s;ing metaphy&s;icians,</HI> who &s;hall &s;tu|dy the di&s;orders and irregularities of the human mind, and pre&s;cribe for their cure.</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered this matter very attentively, and am confident that many of the cares and evils of life might be removed or alleviated by a judici|ous metaphy&s;ical treatment. The fir&s;t difficulty would be to gain the confidence of the patient in a new &s;cience; for this confidence would be as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the metaphy&s;ical as it is to the phy&s;ical cure of di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;and even more &s;o&mdash;for the imagi|nation would have a great &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and mu&s;t indeed &s;erve as apothecary to the meta|phy&s;ician. Wherein does the virtue of pills, po|tions, and plai&s;ters principally con&s;i&s;t? Surely not &s;o much in the ingredients of which they are com|po&s;ed, as in the implicit faith of tho&s;e to whom they are admini&s;tered: a proof of which is, that no &s;ooner is the compo&s;ition generally known but it &s;inks into general contempt; nobody will take a
<PB N="340" REF="024407_0718_0FC6F7E55A02A160">
detected no&s;trum. If, then, this confidence, this im|plicit faith of the patient, is &s;o u&s;eful in the opera|tion of <HI>material</HI> medicine, much more &s;hould it be cultivated and depended upon in a <HI>metaphy&s;ical</HI>
ca&s;e. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this, I would undertake, with flattering hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, to heal the maladies of the mind by the u&s;e of di&s;creet and obviou&s;ly ratio|nal means.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;tance: &s;hould I find my patient di&s;po&s;ed to melancholy, and his mind clouded with imagi|nary doubts, difficulties, and fears, by poring over polemical divinity, and wading deep in in&s;crutable my&s;teries; I would pre&s;cribe a round of amu&s;e|ments, much company, and frequent changes of companions. I would by every artifice provoke him to frequent laughter, and plunge him deep in the vanities of this wicked world: but they &s;hould be vanities only; for I would on no account violate the bounds of &s;trict morality.</P>
<P>TO a patient of a contrary ca&s;t: vain, fickle, loquacious, and full of levity, I would forbid the mo&s;t innocent recreations. I would pre&s;cribe a chapter in the hi&s;tory of the martyrs every morning before breakfa&s;t: he &s;hould &s;tudy algebra till din|ner time; in the evening he &s;hould hear a long dull &s;ermon delivered with an unbroken monotony;
<PB N="341" REF="024407_0719_0FC6F7E619429168">
and &s;hould him&s;elf read one of our acts of a&s;&s;embly before going to bed: and I would continue my regimen and remedies until I &s;aw an entire change of di&s;po&s;ition take place, and a radical cure ob|tained.</P>
<P>BUT I am preparing a full account of the di&s;ea&s;es of the mind, with the proper mode of treatment in each, illu&s;trated by a variety of ca&s;es. This work hath co&s;t me much &s;tudy and deep &s;earches into human nature, and the &s;ubtile &s;prings and move|ments of the moral faculty. Although my book is almo&s;t ready for publication, yet the evils of the pre&s;ent time call &s;o loudly for redre&s;s, that I can|not delay giving an extract from my chapter on the <HI>epidemic</HI> di&s;ea&s;es of the mind, in hopes it may be of immediate u&s;e.</P>
<P><Q><HI>CACOETHES maledictionis,</HI> or an in&s;atiable rage for &s;lander and abu&s;e. This di&s;ea&s;e is peculiar to free governments. The proximate cau&s;es are envy, di&s;content, and an over-weening ambition. The diagno&s;tic &s;ymptoms are an inveterate ha|tred of men of wealth or abilities, and particu|larly of tho&s;e in public offices, and an unu&s;ual predominance of party &s;pirit: and the cri&s;is of the di&s;temper is an acrimonious eruption, di&s;|charging a deal of prurient matter in private com|panies, or in the public papers. The curative
<PB N="342" REF="024407_0720_0FC6F7F93A754D30">
indication is manife&s;t, for this, like many other mental di&s;ea&s;es, is be&s;t managed by allowing a free emi&s;&s;ion of the peccant humours, and permitting the moral faculty to purge it&s;elf by natural di&s;|charges of the malevolent ichor.</Q></P>
<P>THIS quotation &s;ugge&s;ts an ob&s;ervation or two which will lead directly to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. It is recommended, that the moral faculty &s;hould be permitted to <HI>purge it&s;elf</HI> by natural di&s;charges. Now, there are but two po&s;&s;ible ways by which the mind can di&s;charge her contents in the <HI>cacoethes maledictionis;</HI> viz. by <HI>actions,</HI> and by <HI>words;</HI> either by &s;peaking, &s;colding, &s;torming, &s;wearing, writing, or publi&s;hing. When the&s;e means are forbid, or not conveniently obtained, the di&s;ea&s;e breaks out into <HI>actions;</HI> viz. beating, brui&s;ing, mawling, cuf|fing, kicking, and even murdering, killing, and &s;o forth: and, therefore, a free &s;cope &s;hould be given to <HI>words,</HI> as the mo&s;t &s;alutary and &s;afe i&s;&s;ue of the malignant matter.</P>
<P>THE art of printing has been a great ble&s;&s;ing to mankind, ina&s;much as it affords a mo&s;t convenient opportunity for the people to di&s;charge their minds of indige&s;ted crudities and rankling &s;pleen. Before this invention, murders, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, rebellions, and revolutions, were much more frequent than
<PB N="343" REF="024407_0721_0FC6F7FCB1FFB2A8">
&s;ince. The poi&s;oned cup, and the bloody dagger, are not known in countries where the pre&s;s, and and the free u&s;e of it, are allowed. As this is a new and a very deep remark, I hope it will be attend|ed to. I know that the le&s;s &s;anguinary character of modern times is generally attributed to the pro|gre&s;s of civilization. But how has this civilization been advanced? Certainly by the vent which the pre&s;s affords for the morbid minds of the people to get rid of their impurities, and by keeping up a free circulation of ideas, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the men|tal health of man. As a proof, we &s;ee that, in countries where a free acce&s;s to the pre&s;s is not permitted, the <HI>&s;tilletto</HI> is, even at this day, in u&s;e.</P>
<P>I come now to make the propo&s;al which I had in view when I &s;at down to write this paper; a propo&s;al which, I flatter my&s;elf, will correct and mollify, if not totally remove, the virulence of party &s;pirit and per&s;onal animo&s;ity in this &s;tate, and e&s;pecially in the city; and &s;weeten and pu|rify the political atmo&s;phere of our common|wealth. The preface to this my project is, I con|fe&s;s, rather long; but it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the metaphy&s;ical grounds on which it is founded.</P>
<P>LET there be two public papers in&s;tituted. The one a weekly and the other a daily paper.
<PB N="344" REF="024407_0722_0FC6F7FE31F82128">
Let the printers be commi&s;&s;ioned by government, and allowed competent &s;alaries for their time and trouble. They &s;hould be <HI>commi&s;&s;ioned,</HI> becau&s;e all other printers &s;hould be prohibited from interfer|ing in their department. One of the&s;e papers may be entitled <HI>The Freeman's Convenience,</HI> and the other <HI>The Chronicle of Scandal.</HI> Let the&s;e offices be always open as places where the good people of Penn&s;ylvania may ea&s;e their minds without re&s;traint, rebuke, or any hindrance what|ever. And whereas &s;ome men are naturally ba&s;h|ful, and do not like to be &s;een doing their occa|&s;ions, there &s;hall not only be a number of fictitious &s;ignatures provided for their concealment, but the printer &s;hall, for the purpo&s;e of decency, have a tin plate fixed in his window, fronting on a little alley, if his &s;ituation will permit, otherwi&s;e on the &s;treet; in which, there &s;hall be a &s;lit, or opening large enough to receive, &s;ecretly, any ex|crementitious matter; and it &s;hall, for di&s;tinction's &s;ake, be thus in&s;cribed&mdash;"<HI>Wha' wants me?</HI> La&s;t|ly, the printers, their papers, and their authors &s;hould all be <HI>outlawed.</HI> That is, they &s;hould be con&s;idered as beyond the reach of any cen&s;ure or penalty of common or &s;tatute law, or re&s;trictions by any ordinance, proclamation, or regulation whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="024407_0723_0FC6F807213F0C20">BY this in&s;titution all our other public papers would be kept free from impurities, and occupied, as they ought to be, with intere&s;ting or amu&s;ing articles of intelligence, grave or humourous e&s;&s;ays, adverti&s;ements, &amp;c. and all the filth of the city would be carried off by the two commi&s;&s;ioned papers. So that after a little time, it would be|come as &s;hocking to good manners for a man to vent his &s;pleen in one of the public <HI>news</HI>-papers, properly &s;o called, as it would be to commit an in|decent evacuation in a private parlour, or a pub|lic a&s;&s;embly. And thus al&s;o would the minds of the people be kept &s;weet and healthy. For we may refine as we will, but the mind certainly has her indecencies as well as the body, and, when overloaded with indige&s;ted matter, mu&s;t find a vent &s;omewhere. For nature will be obeyed, and &s;urely good policy requires that a &s;uitable place &s;hould be provided for the purpo&s;e, rather than that the public &s;en&s;e &s;hould be continually offend|ed by the evacuations of every di&s;tempered mind, which, though nece&s;&s;ary, are neither decked with ro&s;es nor perfumed with amber.</P>
<P>YET I would not exclude from the common pa|pers of the city attempts at wit and &s;atire, or lit|tle effu&s;ions in ver&s;e, in the poet's corner. A &s;arca&s;m is nothing more than &s;pitting; and &s;o it is u&s;ual
<PB N="346" REF="024407_0724_0FC6F808DDB39788">
to &s;ay&mdash;"He has &s;pit his &s;pite"&mdash;A crude attempt at humour is parallel with blowing one's no&s;e, for &s;uch humours are apt to collect in cold con&s;titu|tions; and a young poeta&s;ter may be put into a con&s;iderable per&s;piration by the &s;corching flames of love&mdash;The&s;e may all happen in the be&s;t com|pany without offence, provide they are conducted with decency; and they are certainly nece&s;&s;ary to health.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with an account of two ca&s;es, in proof of my general &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I knew a young man, about 32 years of age, who, from lo&s;&s;es in trade and cro&s;&s;es in love, began to grow melancholy, retired and di&s;contented. He came to me for advice. I a&s;ked him if he had ever tried to write ver&s;es. He told me that he had upon two or three occa&s;ions, and found that he could tack rhymes together pretty well; but had no thoughts of cultivating the ta|lent. But I advi&s;ed by all means to try what he could do in that way. He followed my pre&s;crip|tion; and employed him&s;elf for a year or two in writing &s;onnets to Mira, Odes to Liberty, and Elegies to birds, and dead lap-dogs, with a variety of other &s;ubjects, according to the cour&s;e of the humours that infected his mind. He is now of a calm, con|templative
<PB N="347" REF="024407_0725_0FC6F80A5E502D78">
habit, but far from melancholy; on the contrary, he is delighted with his own per|formances, and enjoys the comfort of <HI>&s;elf-applau&s;e,</HI> which, after all, is the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial comfort of life.</P>
<P>MY &s;econd in&s;tance is that of a German Doc|tor, who has had, or thinks he has had, a vi&s;ion, in which the my&s;teries and oeconomy of the &s;piritual world was manife&s;ted to him. He has told me the &s;tory of this vi&s;ion, and a very long &s;tory it is&mdash;but I heard it all with patient attention. Some time after, he wanted to tell me the &s;ame &s;tory over again, but I begged to be excu&s;ed. Upon which he candidly a&s;&s;ured me, that he found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to relate the hi&s;tory of his vi|&s;ion, at lea&s;t once a week, otherwi&s;e he grew re&s;t|le&s;s and unea&s;y in his mind. He came indeed full up to my pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, and &s;aid, and in direct terms, that it was <HI>a nece&s;&s;ary evacuation of his mind.</HI></P>
<P>THE practice of the law affords, I confe&s;s, a convenient out-let for much mental virulence. Not only what are called <HI>&s;pite-actions,</HI> but many &s;uits of a more &s;ober a&s;pect, are only extrava&s;ations of mental bile. But this proce&s;s is to expen&s;ive and too tedious for general u&s;e. My propo&s;al
<PB N="348" REF="024407_0726_0FC6F814E678E850">
is, I think, much better in every re&s;pect. It is a &s;cheme by which envy and revenge may be gra|tified without danger and without co&s;t, and abu&s;e, &s;lander, and invective &s;pend them&s;elves, like rock|ets, in harmle&s;s explo&s;ions. For no man, in his &s;en&s;es, will ever think of giving credit to any thing contained in the <HI>Freeman's Convenience or Chronicle of Scandal.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE GRAND FEDERAL PROCESSION. PERFORMED AT PHILADELPHIA ON <DATE>FRIDAY THE 4th OF JULY 1778.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>ON Friday the 4th of July 1788, the citi|zens of Philadelphia celebrated the declaration of <HI>Independence,</HI> made by the Thirteen United States of America on the 4th of July 1776, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> or frame
<PB N="350" REF="024407_0728_0FC6F817DAC66E60">
of government propo&s;ed by the late general con|vention of the &s;tates, and now &s;olemnly adopted and ratified by ten of tho&s;e &s;tates.</P>
<P>THE ri&s;ing &s;un was &s;aluted with a full peal from Chri&s;t Church &s;teeple, and a di&s;charge of cannon from the &s;hip, <HI>Ri&s;ing Sun,</HI> commanded by Captain Philip Brown, anchored off Market &s;treet, and &s;uperbly decorated with the flags of na|tions in alliance with America.</P>
<P>TEN ve&s;&s;els, in honour of the ten &s;tates of the pre&s;ent union, were dre&s;&s;ed and arranged the whole length of the harbour; each bearing a broad white flag at the ma&s;t-head, in&s;cribed with the names of the &s;tates re&s;pectively in broad gold let|ters, in the following order; <HI>New Hamp&s;hire,</HI> oppo&s;ite to the Northern Liberties; <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> oppo&s;ite to Vine &s;treet; <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to Race &s;treet; <HI>New Jer&s;ey,</HI> to Arch &s;treet; <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to Market &s;treet; <HI>Delaware</HI> to Che&s;nut &s;treet; <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI> to Walnut &s;treet; <HI>Virginia</HI> to Spruce &s;treet; <HI>South Carolina,</HI> to Pine &s;treet; and <HI>Geor|gia,</HI> to South &s;treet. The &s;hips along the wharfs were al&s;o dre&s;&s;ed on the occa&s;ion; and as a bri&s;k &s;outh wind prevailed through the whole day, the flags and pennants were kept in full di&s;play; and exhibited a mo&s;t plea&s;ing and animating pro&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="024407_0729_0FC6F81FE06672E8">ACCORDING to orders i&s;&s;ued the day before, the &s;everal parts which were to compo&s;e this grand proce&s;&s;ion, began to a&s;&s;emble at eight o'clock in the morning, at and near the inter&s;ection of South and Third-&s;treets.</P>
<P>NINE gentlemen, di&s;tingui&s;hed by white plumes in their hats, and furni&s;hed with &s;peaking trum|pets, were &s;uperintendants of the proce&s;&s;ion; viz. general <HI>Mifflin,</HI> general <HI>Stewart,</HI> colonel <HI>Proctor,</HI> colonel <HI>Gurney,</HI> colonel <HI>Will,</HI> colonel <HI>Mar&s;h,</HI> ma|jor <HI>Moore,</HI> major <HI>Lenox,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peter Brown.</HI></P>
<P>THE different companies of military, trades and profe&s;&s;ions, had previou&s;ly met in various parts of the city, of their own appointment; where they were &s;eparately formed by their officers and con|conductors, and marched in order with their re|&s;pective flags, devices, and machines, to the place of general rendezvous. As the&s;e companies arriv|ed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the &s;uperintendants di&s;po&s;ed of them in the neighbouring &s;treets in &s;uch manner as that they might ea&s;ily fall into the &s;tations they were to occupy in forming the general proce&s;&s;ion, as they &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively called upon. By this means the mo&s;t perfect order and regularity was effectually pre&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="024407_0730_0FC6F82942EC7D48">AFTER a &s;trict review of the &s;treets of the city, it had been determined, that the line of march &s;hould be as follows. To commence at the inter|&s;ection of South and Third-&s;treets; thence along Third-&s;treet to Callowhill-&s;treet; thence up Cal|lowhill-&s;treet to Fourth-&s;treet; thence along Fourth-&s;treet to Market-&s;treet; and thence to UNION GREEN, in front of Bu&s;h-Hill&mdash;<HI>William Hamilton, e&s;q.</HI> having kindly offered the &s;pacious lawn before his hou&s;e at Bu&s;h-Hill for the purpo|&s;es of the day.</P>
<P>THE &s;treet commi&s;&s;ioners had, the evening be|fore, gone through the line of march, and directed the pavements to be &s;wept, the trees to be lopped, and all ob&s;tacles removed.</P>

<P>THE &s;enators of Rome, &s;eated on their curule chairs, and &s;urrounded with all their official lu&s;|tre, were an object much more re&s;pectable; and we view, without di&s;plea&s;ure, the admiration of tho&s;e untutored &s;avages, who con&s;idered them as &s;o many gods upon earth.

<P>THE far famed e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> was introduced by deception and fraud.

When the de&s;cription was made, the force of liberty pervaded the &s;oil.</P>
<P>BUT is <HI>agriculture</HI> the only art which feels the influence of government?

But in the giddy hour of her pro&s;perity, &s;he &s;purned from her the ob|&s;cure in&s;truments by which it was acquired; and in their place &s;ub&s;tituted <HI>luxury</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;ipation.</HI> The con&s;equence was &s;uch as might have been ex|pected: &s;he pre&s;erved, for &s;ome time, a gay and flouri&s;hing appearance; but the internal health

and &s;oundne&s;s of her con&s;titution was gone. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> la&s;t &s;he fell a victim to the poi&s;onous draughts which were admini&s;tered by her perfidious favou|rites. The fate of Rome, both in her <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> and in her <HI>falling</HI> &s;tate, will be the fate of every other nation that &s;hall follow <HI>both</HI> parts of her example.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY appears next among the virtues of a good citizen. Idlene&s;s is the nur&s;e of villains. The indu&s;trious alone con&s;titute a nation's &s;trength. I will not expatiate on this fruitful &s;ubject: let one animating reflection &s;uffice. In a <HI>well con&s;ti|tuted commonwealth,</HI> the indu&s;try of every citizen extends beyond him&s;elf. A common intere&s;t per|vades the &s;ociety. <HI>Each</HI> gains from ALL, and <HI>all</HI> gain from EACH. It has often been ob&s;erved, that the <HI>&s;ciences</HI> flouri&s;h <HI>all together;</HI> the remark applies equally to the <HI>arts.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR patriotic feelings atte&s;t the truth of what I &s;ay, when, among the virtues nece&s;&s;ary to merit and pre&s;erve the advantages of a good govern|ment, I number a <HI>warm</HI> and <HI>uniform</HI> attachment to LIBERTY, and to the CONSTITUTION. The ene|mies of liberty are artful and in&s;iduous. A <HI>coun|terfeit</HI> &s;teals her <HI>dre&s;s,</HI> imitates her <HI>manners,</HI> forges
<PB N="413" REF="024407_0791_0FC6F74B9D258088">
her <HI>&s;ignature,</HI> a&s;&s;umes her <HI>name:</HI> but the real name of the deceiver is LICENTIOUSNESS. Such is her effrontery, that &s;he will charge liberty to her face with impo&s;ture; and &s;he will, with &s;hamele&s;s front, in&s;i&s;t that her&s;elf alone is the <HI>genuine character,</HI> and that her&s;elf alone is entitled to the re&s;pect which the <HI>genuine character</HI> de&s;erves. With the giddy and undi&s;cerning, on whom a deeper impre&s;&s;ion is made by dauntle&s;s impudence, than by mode&s;t me|rit, her preten&s;ions are often &s;ucce&s;sful. <HI>She</HI> re|receives the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ours of liberty; and liberty her&s;elf is treated as a <HI>traitor</HI> and an <HI>u&s;urper.</HI> Generally, however, this bold impo&s;tor acts only a <HI>&s;econ|dary</HI> part. Though &s;he alone appear upon the &s;tage, her motions are regulated by <HI>dark ambition,</HI> who &s;tands concealed behind the curtain, and who knows that <HI>de&s;poti&s;m,</HI> his other favourite, can al|ways follow the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Again&s;t the&s;e enemies of <HI>liberty,</HI> who act in concert, though they appear on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, the patriot citizen will keep a watchful guard.</P>
<P><HI>A good con&s;titution</HI> is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing which a &s;ociety can enjoy. Need I infer, that it is the duty of every citizen to u&s;e his be&s;t and mo&s;t un|remitting endeavours for pre&s;erving it pure, health|ful, and vigorous? For the accompli&s;hment of this
<PB N="414" REF="024407_0792_0FC6F74D23CB8748">
great purpo&s;e, the exertions of no one citizen are unimportant. Let no one, therefore, harbour for a moment the mean idea that he is, and can be of no value to his country. Let the contrary manly impre&s;&s;ion animate his &s;oul. Every one can, at <HI>many</HI> times, perform to the &s;tate <HI>u&s;eful &s;ervices;</HI> and he who &s;teadily pur&s;ues the road of patrioti&s;m has the mo&s;t inviting pro&s;pect, of being able, at <HI>&s;ome</HI> times, to perform <HI>eminent</HI> ones.</P>
<P>ALLOW me to direct your attention, in a very particular manner, to a momentous part, which, by this con&s;titution, every citizen will frequently be call|ed to act. All tho&s;e, in places of power and tru&s;t, will be elected, either immediately by the people, or in &s;uch a manner that their appointment will depend ultimately on &s;uch immediate election. All the <HI>derivative</HI> movements of government mu&s;t &s;pring from the <HI>original</HI> movement of the <HI>people at large.</HI> If, to <HI>this,</HI> they give a &s;ufficient force, and a ju&s;t direction, all the others will be govern|ed by its controlling power. To &s;peak without a metaphor; if the people, at their elections, take care to choo&s;e none but repre&s;entatives that are <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> their repre&s;entatives will take care, in their turn, to choo&s;e or appoint none but &s;uch as are <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>good</HI> al&s;o. The remark applies to every &s;ucceeding election and appointment. Thus
<PB N="415" REF="024407_0793_0FC6F74EA9A98318">
the characters proper for public officers will be dif|fu&s;ed from the <HI>immediate elections</HI> of the people o|ver the remote&s;t parts of admini&s;tration. Of what immen&s;e con&s;equence is it, then, that this <HI>primary</HI> duty &s;hould be faithfully and &s;kilfully di&s;charged? On the faithful di&s;charge of it, the public happi|ne&s;s or infelicity under this, and every other con|&s;titution, mu&s;t, in a very great mea&s;ure, depend. For, believe me, no government, even the be&s;t, can be happily admini&s;tered by <HI>ignorant</HI> or <HI>vicious</HI> men. You will forgive me, I am &s;ure, for endea|vouring to impre&s;s upon your minds, in the &s;trong|e&s;t manner, the importance of this great duty. It is the fir&s;t <HI>concoction</HI> in politics; and if an er|ror is committed <HI>here,</HI> it can never be corrected in any &s;ub&s;equent <HI>proce&s;s,</HI> the certain con&s;equence mu&s;t be <HI>di&s;ea&s;e.</HI> Let no one &s;ay, that he is but a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> citizen, and that his ticket will be but <HI>one</HI> in the box; that <HI>one</HI> ticket may <HI>turn</HI> the election. In battle, every &s;oldier &s;hould con&s;ider the public &s;afety as depending on his <HI>&s;ingle</HI> arm; at an elec|tion, every citizen &s;hould con&s;ider the public hap|pine&s;s as depending on his <HI>&s;ingle</HI> vote.</P>
<P><HI>A progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s and perfection of man. Whatever attainments are already reached, attainments &s;till higher &s;hould

be pur&s;ued. Let us therefore &s;trive with noble emulation. Let us &s;uppo&s;e we have done nothing while any thing yet remains to be done. Let us, with fervent zeal, pre&s;s forward, and make uncea&s;|ing advances in every thing that can <HI>&s;upport, im|prove, refine,</HI> or <HI>embelli&s;h</HI> &s;ociety.</P>
<P>TO enter into particulars under each of the&s;e heads, and to dilate them according to their im|portance, would be improper at this time. A few remarks on the <HI>la&s;t</HI> of them will be congenial with the entertainments of this au&s;picious day.</P>
<P>IF we give the &s;lighte&s;t attention to <HI>nature,</HI> we &s;hall di&s;cover, that with <HI>utility</HI> &s;he is curious to blend <HI>ornament.</HI> Can we imitate a better pattern?

<P>THE commencement of our government has been eminently glorious; let our progre&s;s in eve|ry excellence be proportionably great&mdash;it will&mdash; it mu&s;t be &s;o.

With heartfelt contentment, <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> beholds his hone&s;t labours flouri&s;hing and &s;ecure. <HI>Peace</HI> walks &s;erene and unalarmed over all the unmole&s;ted regions; while <HI>liberty, virtue,</HI> and <HI>religion</HI> go hand in hand, har|moniou&s;ly <HI>protecting, enlivening,</HI> and <HI>exalting</HI> all&mdash; Happy country!

<P>AFTER, the oration, the &s;everal light companies vere drawn off by captain Hey&s;ham, to an emi|nence, and fired a feu-de-joie of three rounds, and then the company went to dinner. No &s;pirit or wine of any kind were introduced: American por|ter, beer, and cyder, were the only liquors; and of the&s;e the &s;upplies were very abundant. The whole inner circumference of the circle of tables was lined with hog&s;heads, butts, and barrels of the&s;e liquors on tap. The following toa&s;ts were drank, announced by trumpets, and an&s;wered by the artillery&mdash;a round of ten to each toa&s;t&mdash;and the&s;e were again an&s;wered by cannon from the &s;hip <HI>Ri&s;ing Sun,</HI> at her moorings in the river.</P>

<P>It &s;hould not be omitted in this account, that the &s;everal trades furni&s;hed the devices, mottos, machines, and decorations them&s;elves, and at the expence of their re&s;pective companies. And that nearly the whole of the work exhibited on that day, was completed between Monday mor|ning and the Thur&s;day evening following.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="024407_0798_0FC6F77546D07220">THE military in general, hor&s;e, artillery, and infantry were completely dre&s;&s;ed, and accoutred, according to the uniform of their re&s;pective corps, and made a mo&s;t martial appearance; being di&s;tri|buted in various parts of the line, they gave a beautiful variety to the whole, and evinced that both &s;oldiers and citizens united in favour of the new government.</P>
<P>THE whole of this va&s;t body was formed, and the entertainment of the day conducted, with a re|gularity and decorum far beyond all rea&s;onable ex|pectation. The foot-ways, the windows, and the roofs of the hou&s;es were crouded with &s;pectators, exhibiting a &s;pectacle truly magnificent and irre&s;i&s;t|tibly animating. But what was mo&s;t plea&s;ing to to the contemplative mind, <HI>univer&s;al love</HI> and <HI>har|mony</HI> prevailed, and every countenance appeared to be the index of a heart glowing with urbanity and rational joy. This &s;ocial idea was much en|forced by a circum&s;tance, which, probably, never before occurred in &s;uch extent, viz. The clergy of almo&s;t every denomination united in charity and brotherly love. May they and their flocks &s;o walk through life!</P>

The green was entirely cleared by &s;ix o'clock in the evening; and the edifice, &s;hip, and &s;everal machines, being withdrawn, the citizens &s;oberly retired to their re|&s;pective homes. The weather was remarkably fa|vourable for the &s;ea&s;on; cloudy without rain, and a bri&s;k wind from the &s;outh during the whole day.

<HEAD>[A. D. 1779.] TUCKER, QUI TAM ver&s;us THE SHIP POLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;hip Pole &s;ailed from Liverpool, in Eng|land, with a cargo of goods for the city of New York in America, then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h troops, under a commi&s;&s;ion of letters of marque and repri&s;al again&s;t the &s;ubjects of the United States; and with orders from her owners to cruize again&s;t the Americans in her voyage,
<PB N="2" REF="024407_0807_0FC72FB101B06368">
being properly armed for that purpo&s;e. After the delivery of her cargo at New York, &s;he was to &s;ail for Jamaica, take in a lading of rum and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|gars, and then return to Liverpool.</P>
<P>SUCH was the plan of the voyage; &s;ubjected, however, to the di&s;cretion of an agent at New York, who had power to alter it if he &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;hip had delivered her cargo at New York, the agent ordered her to cruize on the American coa&s;t for four months, and &s;hipped hands on board her for the purpo&s;e, as <HI>privateer's-men,</HI> which appeared by an endor&s;ement on the &s;hip's articles. She had al&s;o a let-pa&s;s on board, &s;igned by the &s;enior naval officer at New York, &s;tiling her a privateer.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e circum&s;tances the <HI>Pole</HI> &s;ailed from New York, and was captured by Tucker, in a fri|gate belonging to the United States, and libelled again&s;t in the admiralty of Penn&s;ylvania as prize: whereupon a claim was filed in behalf of the Unit|ed States for one half of the value, under an ordi|nance of congre&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed October 30^t^h 1776, which gives the whole of ve&s;&s;els of war taken by the &s;hips of the United States to the captors, but re|&s;erves
<PB N="3" REF="024407_0808_0FC72FB4CED1BB50">
one half of merchantmen &s;o taken, to the &s;tates.</P>
<P>THE only que&s;tion was, whether the &s;hip <HI>Pole,</HI> at the time of her being captured, &s;hould be con&s;i|dered as an armed merchantman, or a privateer belonging to the enemy.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT</HI> in favour of the captors for the whole.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>TUCKER, QUI TAM ver&s;us THE SLOOP WILLIAM.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;loop William, captain A&s;hburner, was the property of John Wallace, an inhabitant of the i&s;land of St. Croix, and a &s;ubject of the king of Denmark. She took in a part of her la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng at St. Croix, and cleared out at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e there for the port of Philadelphia. From St.
<PB N="4" REF="024407_0809_0FC72FB74B84B330">
Croix &s;he went to Tortola, a Briti&s;h i&s;land, where &s;he took in the remainder of her cargo, which, by the te&s;timony, appeared to have been &s;ent after her in a droger from St. Croix. At Tortola, captain A&s;hburner, who was part owner of the cargo, cleared out at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e there for New York, then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h troops.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e double clearances, &s;he arrived on the American coa&s;t, where captain Tucker di&s;co|vered, pur&s;ued, and boarded her under Briti&s;h co|lours. A&s;hburner mi&s;taking Tucker for a Briti&s;h officer, exhibited his Tortola papers, and alledged that he was bound for New York, whereupon Tucker took the &s;loop as prize, brought her to Philadelphia, and libelled again&s;t her in the ad|miralty as prize; at the &s;ame time a claim was filed in behalf of Wallace and A&s;hburner, the owners.</P>
<P>ON the trial, it was urged, in favour of the claimants, that this ve&s;&s;el and cargo were wholly Dani&s;h property, and that, notwith&s;tanding the Tortola clearance, the &s;loop was in fact bound for Philadelphia, which clearance was only intended as a cover from Briti&s;h capture. In proof of this, many letters were exhibited, found on board, to &s;undry merchants of the United States. In parti|cular, one to John Willcox of Philadelphia, con|taining
<PB N="5" REF="024407_0810_0FC72FBB9FA62088">
invoices of the cargo, and con&s;igning the whole to him, informing him al&s;o that the ve&s;&s;el was covered with a Briti&s;h clearance.</P>
<P>IT was further &s;hewn, that from the cour&s;e of the wind, and the direction in which &s;he was &s;ail|ing at the time &s;he was di&s;covered, the probability was, that &s;he intended for the Delaware.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT</HI> for the claimants.</P>
<P>N. B. This was previous to the ordinance of congre&s;s making double papers condemnation.</P>

<HEAD>BOYD AND CARTER ver&s;us THE SCHOONER JEMIMA.</HEAD>

<PB N="6" REF="024407_0811_0FC72FBDE5B899D8">
as &s;he lay aground in a creek near to Borden-town, in New Jer&s;ey, who &s;tripped her, and then &s;et her on fire. The libellants claimed &s;alvage, for that they, at con&s;iderable ri&s;k (the enemy be-yet in &s;ight) went on board, extingui&s;hed the fire, and &s;aved the ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<HEAD>HOUSTON ver&s;us THE BRIG CHARMING NANCY.</HEAD>
<P>THE brig charming Nancy, belonging to Pur|viance, and others, &s;ubjects of the United States, was on her voyage from Senepuxent to Philadel|phia, when &s;he was di&s;covered near the Capes of Delaware by Hou&s;ton, in a Philadelphia priva|teer, then out at &s;ea. Hou&s;ton hoi&s;ted Briti&s;h
<PB N="7" REF="024407_0812_0FC72FC3C0539288">
colours, and endeavoured to come up with her&punc; whereupon, M'Kenzie, captain of the Charming Nancy, taking Hou&s;ton for an enemy, endea|voured to run his ve&s;&s;el on &s;hore; but being una|ble to effect this in time, he, with the whole of his crew, took to their boat, and rowed to land, not leaving a &s;oul on board the brig. M'Kenzie &s;oon after di&s;covered his mi&s;take, went on board his ve&s;&s;el again with his mariners, and brought her up to Philadelphia. And now Hou&s;ton libelled for &s;alvage, as having found the ve&s;&s;el abandoned on the high &s;eas, and &s;aved her to her owners.</P>
<P>But as the abandomment was occa&s;ioned by the libellant's own act, the bill was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT,</HI> that the brig be re&s;tored wholly to her owners.</P>

<HEAD>HALESKAMP, ver&s;us THE SWIFT's BOAT, AND THREE NEGROES.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Swift,</HI> a Briti&s;h &s;loop of war, cha&s;ed the <HI>Rattle&s;nake,</HI> an American privateer, till, in the heat of the action and cha&s;e, both ve&s;&s;els ran a|&s;hore on the coa&s;t of Virginia, and &s;tranded: the captain of the Swift then &s;urrendered to the Rat|tle&s;nake. The negroes in que&s;tion were taken on board the Swift. M'Cullough, commander of the Rattle&s;nake, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his prize, and em|ployed the negroes for &s;ome time in &s;aving goods from both wrecks: but the negroes, watching a favourable opportunity, took the Swift's boat and went off, intending for New York. Hale&s;kamp &s;aw them from the &s;hore, pur&s;ued, and took them, and now libelled again&s;t the boat and negroes as his prize.</P>
<P>AND it was urged, in behalf of the libellant, that the property, not having been condemned in

a court of admiralty, ve&s;ted with M'Cullough on|ly as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ory right, which cea&s;ed the moment an e&s;cape could be effected, and therefore the li|bellant ought to be con&s;idered as an original captor.</P>
<P>BUT the judge was of opinion, that M'Cul|lough had by the capture acquired a right, <HI>&s;ub judice,</HI> which could not be injured by a fellow &s;ub|ject, and which a court of ju&s;tice alone could con|firm or invalidate: that if Hale&s;kamp had libelled for &s;alvage only, it had been good; but not as prize.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT</HI>&mdash;that the libel be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>YOUNG, ver&s;us THE SLOOP HAERLEM.</HEAD>
<P>SHAW, and others, of the city of New York, &s;ubjects of the United States, were owners of the

privateer &s;loop Harlequin (now called the Haer|lem.) In September 1776, the Briti&s;h then in|vading New York, this &s;loop was, by order of <HI>General Wa&s;hington,</HI> &s;tationed in Haerlem river to defend that pa&s;s, and prevent the enemy's boats from going up the river. On the retreat of <HI>General Wa&s;hington</HI> with his troops, the own|ers not being able to get their ve&s;&s;el out to &s;ea, on account of the enemy, had her &s;cuttled and &s;unk in Haerlem river, where &s;he was &s;tationed, and then fled. The Briti&s;h troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New York, and afterwards, by order of admiral Howe, this ve&s;&s;el was rai&s;ed, was called the Haer|lem, and &s;itted out as a crui&s;er in the Briti&s;h &s;er|vice. After crui&s;ing three years again&s;t the Ame|ricans, and taking many prizes, &s;he was at la&s;t captured by the libellants. Whereupon the for|mer owners claimed her as their property; offer|ing to pay one half of her value for &s;alvage, as having been more than 96 hours in the enemy's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when &s;he was re-captured: alledging, that their property had not entirely dive&s;ted; be|cau&s;e there was no proof that &s;he had ever been condemned as prize in the Briti&s;h court of admi|ralty.</P>
<P>BUT although there was indeed no direct proof of &s;uch condemnation, yet the length of time &s;he

<P>OSMAN was a pri&s;oner in Jamaica, where al&s;o he had money due to him. With this money he purcha&s;ed five hog&s;heads of rum. He was then, with other pri&s;oners of war, put on board this &s;loop, which was Briti&s;h property, to be conveyed to New York, and was permitted to take his five

The pri&s;oners ro&s;e at &s;ea upon the captain and crew, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;loop, and brought her into the port of Philadelphia. <HI>O&s;man</HI> was privy to the de&s;ign, but unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t per&s;onally in the capture, being confined in bed by his wounds.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT,</HI> that the &s;loop be condemned as prize, and that <HI>O&s;man</HI> have his five hog&s;heads of rum, together with a di&s;tributive &s;hare of the prize.</P>

And now the owners claim their ve&s;&s;el again, on paying &s;alvage, agreeably to the marine laws of America.</P>
<P>BUT it was urged, that they, being French &s;ubjects, ought to be determined by the law of France, which gives the whole of re-captured ve&s;|&s;els to the re-captor, when the prize has been more than twenty four hours in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy.</P>
<P>BUT the judge was of opinion, that as Ameri|can owners were, in ca&s;es of recapture, allowed the benefit of the American law in the admiralty courts of France, French owners ought al&s;o to have the benefit of the American law in the ports of the United States.</P>

<P>AT the commencement of ho&s;tilities between Great Britain and America, the Briti&s;h &s;eized &s;e|veral merchant ve&s;&s;els in the harbour of Bo&s;ton, among&s;t which was the <HI>Hope,</HI> belonging to Blew|er, and others, of Philadelphia.

<P>THE claimants in&s;i&s;ted, that this ve&s;&s;el had ne|ver been condemned as prize in a Briti&s;h court of admiralty; becau&s;e, at the time &s;he was &s;eized at Bo&s;ton, no letters of marque and repri&s;al had as

<HEAD>RICE ver&s;us TAYLOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE parties were commanders of privateers duly commi&s;&s;ioned. Taylor engaged, and took a prize, Rice being in &s;ight at the time of the cap|ture. Whereupon Rice claimed a &s;hare of booty under the maritime law.</P>
<P>ON the trial it appeared, that although Rice was in &s;ight at the time of the action, yet from the pe|culiarity of his &s;ituation, it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have contributed to the capture by terrifying the enemy: and &s;o the jury found a &s;pecial verdict in the&s;e words.</P>
<P><Q>THAT captain John Rice was in &s;ight, and at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix miles at the time of
<PB N="17" REF="024407_0822_0FC72FE32D09CCE8">
the &s;aid capture, mentioned, and &s;o forth; but that he did not contribute to the &s;aid capture, or influence her &s;urrender to the &s;aid captain Taylor. And if upon this finding, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>THE fact was, that Rice lay within a bar, clo&s;e upon the &s;hore of New Jer&s;ey, and &s;aw Taylor engage a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el, about five or &s;ix miles out at &s;ea. There were al&s;o two Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els of force between Rice and Taylor, at the time of the ac|tion. Rice, ob&s;erving the battle, &s;aw at la&s;t one of the ve&s;&s;els &s;trike to the other, but could not clearly di&s;cern which had the victory: believing that Taylor had &s;urrendered, he reported in Jer|&s;ey that poor Taylor was taken at la&s;t. But he found a few days afterwards, that Taylor had been &s;ucce&s;sful, and brought his prize &s;afe into port. Whereupon he claimed a &s;hare of the booty under the general law reflecting ve&s;&s;els in &s;ight of a capture.</P>
<P>IN the argument on the &s;pecial verdict, the coun|&s;el for Rice re&s;ted his claim principally on Mol|loy, Book 1^s^t chap. 2. &s;ect. 20. urging that no te&s;|timony &s;hould be admitted again&s;t a pre&s;umption of law.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="024407_0823_0FC72FE4CBF6CA38">BUT the judge ob&s;erved, that the pre&s;umption of law is founded on a material fact: to wit, that the ve&s;&s;el in &s;ight be armed and <HI>prepared for battle,</HI> or at lea&s;t in a po&s;&s;ible condition to join in the bat|tle. When this is the ca&s;e, the law will pre&s;ume that her pre&s;ence terrified the enemy and influ|enced the &s;urrender; and therefore, although &s;he does not join in the engagement, allows her a &s;hare of the prize in proportion to her men and guns. But if a ve&s;&s;el in &s;ight is aground on a&s;hoal or bar, or is far to leeward, with di&s;abled ma&s;ts and rigging, or is &s;o &s;ituated (as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e) that it is manife&s;tly impo&s;&s;ible for her to take any part in the battle, &s;he cannot be con&s;idered as to be &s;o <HI>prepared for battle</HI> as to bring her with|in the pre&s;umption of law.</P>

<HEAD>GEDDES ver&s;us THE GOLDEN ROSE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Golden Ro&s;e,</HI> belonging to &s;ubjects of the States of Holland, &s;ailed from Hamburgh with a cargo con&s;igned to Colloghan and Sons, merchants, in the i&s;land of Teneriff, an i&s;land belonging to the crown of Spain.</P>
<P>HOLLAND was at this time in a &s;tate neutrali|ty, but Britain had declared war again&s;t Spain, and neither of the&s;e nations were in alliance with the United States of America.</P>
<P>THE Golden Ro&s;e was captured near the I&s;land of Teneriff by a Briti&s;h privateer, and ordered for New York, then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h army, and on her way to New York &s;he was re|taken
<PB N="20" REF="024407_0825_0FC72FECC740DB78">

<P>HASSENCLEVER filed a claim for the &s;hip and cargo in behalf of the owners and merchants, &s;ub|jects of the &s;tates of Holland, and</P>
<P>DON Juan de Miralles al&s;o filed a claim for the cargo only, in behalf of Colloghan and Sons, &s;ub|jects of the king of Spain.</P>
<P>IT was argued for the libellant, that although the &s;hip and cargo did originally belong to the &s;ubjects of neutral powers with re&s;pect to America, yet the property had totally dive&s;ted by the Briti&s;h capture, the ve&s;&s;el having been more than than &s;ix weeks in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: that if any injury was done to the neutral owners, it was done by the Bri|ti&s;h captain who fir&s;t took her, and not by the li|bellant, who forced her from a declared enemy as he had a right to do: that the pre&s;ent ca&s;e came within the re&s;olve of congre&s;s of November, 1775, declaring that all ve&s;&s;els employed in tran&s;|porting provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and &s;o forth, to the ene|my in New York, &s;hould, if taken, be lawful prize. And la&s;tly, that if this ve&s;&s;el &s;hould not be condemned as prize, it would be ea&s;y for &s;ubjects of neutral nations to &s;upply the Briti&s;h at New

<P>ON the contrary, it was urged for the claimants, that this &s;hip had committed no offence whatever, that her intended voyage was a lawful one, viz. from Hamburgh to Teneriff. And although the libellant took her in her way to New York, yet it was by compul&s;ion that &s;he was found in that cour&s;e. that the Briti&s;h privateer had violated the laws of nations in taking her, and therefore &s;he could not have been condemned in their courts of ad|miralty; inferring, that as &s;he was not legal prize to the captors, the re-captors could have no better title: and that, &s;uppo&s;ing the cargo to be Spani&s;h property, yet as it had not been condemned to the captors, the property had not been totally di|ve&s;ted, but that the <HI>jus po&s;tliminii</HI> took place, a|greeably to the ordinance of congre&s;s of Decem|ber 5. 1775.</P>
<P>AFTER long argument, the judge in&s;tructed the jury, that as the facts were all acceded to in this cau&s;e, viz. That the &s;hip was Dutch, and the cargo Spani&s;h property, and that &s;he had been ta|ken and retaken, as &s;et forth in the libel, the deci|&s;ion mu&s;t depend upon points of law only, and therefore recommended their bringing in a &s;pecial

<HEAD>(1780.) MONTGOMERY ve&s;us. WHARTON, AND OTHERS, OWNERS OF THE SHIP GENERAL GREENE.</HEAD>
<P>WHARTON, and others, owners of the &s;hip General Greene, had chartered her to certain mer|chants for a particular voyage, and appointed Montgomery ma&s;ter for that voyage. The &s;hip had cleared out at the naval office, and was on the point of &s;ailing, when a &s;udden fro&s;t filled the Delaware with ice, and fixed her in the port of Philadelphia. During the winter &s;ome differen|ces
<PB N="25" REF="024407_0830_0FC72FFA7B519F88">
aro&s;e between the owners and ma&s;ter. The con&s;equence of which was that the owners by a letter of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, di&s;charged Montgomery from their &s;ervice, and put another ma&s;ter on board. Whereupon Montgomery libelled again&s;t the ow|ners in the admiralty to compell them to fulfil their contract with him.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion was, whether owners could di&s;|mi&s;s the ma&s;ter they had appointed before the completion of the voyage, after he had &s;igned bills of lading for the cargo, and &s;hipped his ma|riner, without the owners &s;hewing &s;ufficient cau&s;e for &s;uch di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>AND it was contended, that the ma&s;ter, from the time of his appointment, has the &s;ole com|mand of the &s;hip ve&s;ted in him, and cannot be di&s;|placed without committing &s;ome offence &s;ufficient to forfeit his rights and ju&s;tify a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. That after &s;igning bills of lading, he becomes an|&s;werable to the freighters for the delivery of the cargo, and that the owners cannot by their act exo|nerate him from this charge, whil&s;t the bills of la|ding &s;igned with his hand, remain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the freighters: that the libellant, con&s;idering him&s;elf as engaged for this voyage, had neglected to &s;eek for any other appointment; and that the

owners di&s;charging him at this time, was an inju|ry which the court ought in ju&s;tice to redre&s;s by compelling them to rein&s;tate him in his office.</P>
<P>IN behalf of the re&s;pondents it was urged, that the owners of a &s;hip have, and ought to have, a right to remove the ma&s;ter at plea&s;ure; becau&s;e their intere&s;ts are &s;o deeply concerned in the ap|pointment, that they are an&s;werable not only for his imprudent conduct, but are bound by con|tracts he may legally make on account of the con|cern: that if, after their their choice or a ma&s;ter, his appointment &s;hould be deemed irrevocable for the voyage, unle&s;s &s;ome gro&s;s offence can be proved, the owners will be at the mercy of the ma&s;ter, who, by his weak or wicked conduct, may bring them to ruin. That if when the owners have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ma&s;ter, the court &s;hould undertake to rein&s;tate him, contrary to their judgment and inclination, and &s;o force him upon them, the court and not the owners, ought to be an&s;werable to the freigh|ters for any con&s;equences that may en&s;ue: that neither the charter-party, &s;hipping articles, or bills of lading, prohibit a change of the ma|&s;ter, as the contracts made with him are made in his official and not in his per&s;onal capa|city: that the ma&s;ter is in fact the repre&s;enta|tive of the owners, and not him&s;elf per&s;onally

bound, neither is he an&s;werable for the conduct of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or: that in ca&s;e an action &s;hould be brought again&s;t him for a breach of contract on the bills of lading, he might plead his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion by the owners, and it would be good in law: that the &s;ubordinate officers are appointed by the ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, and if they &s;hould mi&s;behave, or prove in&s;ufficient or un&s;afe, the owners have no remedy but by the removal of the ma&s;ter: that if owners are bound by the appointment of a ma|&s;ter to continue him for the voyage, the ma&s;ter ought al&s;o to be bound to perform the voyage, even again&s;t his intere&s;t or inclination; but if, in ca&s;e of the ma&s;ter's refu&s;al, the owners &s;hould li|bel again&s;t him in the admiralty, the court could give no redre&s;s, becau&s;e the court cannot award damages, neither can it compel the ma&s;ter to a &s;pe|cific performance of his contract, from the nature of the &s;ervice: that the ma&s;ter's appointment is, and ought to be during plea&s;ure only: that the &s;ame pow|er which appoints can remove: that if a ma&s;ter &s;uffers injury by an unrea&s;onable di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, he may have his remedy at common law, where ample recompence in damages will be made to him: and finally, that whatever inconveniences may ari&s;e to ma&s;ters being &s;ubjected to the caprice of owners

<P>TO which, council for the libellant replied&mdash; That this cau&s;e came properly before the court of admiralty: that where a court hath the right to take cognizance of an injury, it follows nece&s;&s;arily that it can give redre&s;s: that if the court cannot award damages, it can order a &s;pecific performance of the contract: that the court can compel the ma&s;ter to &s;uch performance; and if he refu&s;es, can attach his per&s;on, and oblige him to give &s;e|curity for the completion of his contract; and, therefore, the juri&s;diction is competent: that it would be unju&s;t to &s;end the ma&s;ter to common law for redre&s;s, on the owner's breach of contract, as the owners may fail and be unable to pay dama|ges, and therefore the &s;hip ought to be his certain and proper &s;ecurity: that all contracts ought to be &s;acred and mutual, being founded on reciprocity; and it would be ab&s;urd to alledge, that the ma&s;ter is bound on his part, and the owners not bound on theirs: that a ma&s;ter engaged for a voyage, is
<PB N="29" REF="024407_0834_0FC73004A5420E30">
like a &s;ervant indented for a certain time; and that the engagement or indenture cannot be di&s;&s;olved, during the terms, but by mutual con&s;ent: that this ve&s;&s;el was chartered to the freighter, who acquired by the charter-party a temporary property in her, and the owners had nothing to do with her for the time, the &s;hip being under the &s;ame circum&s;tances with a hou&s;e lea&s;ed for a term: that after the char|ter-party is &s;igned, and the goods laden on board, the owners cannot di&s;charge the ma&s;ter at their plea&s;ure; as his good character and abilities might have been the inducement which led the freighter to make choice of that &s;hip in preference: and, la&s;tly, that if no in&s;tance can be found of a ma&s;ter's being forced upon the owners of a &s;hip, neither can any authority be produced, giving the owners the arbitrary power of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the ma&s;ter at plea&s;ure, and without a&s;&s;igning &s;ufficient cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having carefully con&s;idered the argu|ments advanced, and the authorities cited in this cau&s;e, it appears to me unnece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue the whole tract of argument that hath been taken on this occa&s;ion. The deci&s;ion of the cau&s;e re&s;ts &s;ole|ly on the nature of the contract between the ow|ners
<PB N="30" REF="024407_0835_0FC73005D80E37E8">
of a &s;hip and the captain they employ. And the terms or &s;ub&s;tance of &s;uch a contract is, in my opinion this, viz. If the ma&s;ter well and faithfully performs the duties of his &s;tation, the owners, on on their part, are bound to pay the &s;tipulated wa|ges, and allow him all the cu&s;tomary privileges of his office. But it does not &s;eem to be any part of the contract, that a ma&s;ter once engaged, &s;hall be ma&s;ter for the voyage at all events. This might be extremely injurious to owners, on account of the very exten&s;ive powers a ma&s;ter hath over their property. And however hard it may appear that that the ma&s;ter &s;hould be &s;ubject to the caprice of his owners in this re&s;pect, he mu&s;t con&s;ider it as one of the unavoidable inconveniences of his oc|cupation, and in ca&s;es of real injury apply to the laws of his country for redre&s;s. Much greater would the danger be to owners of ve&s;&s;els, and in|deed to commerce in general, if the appointment of a ma&s;ter &s;hould be irrevocable for the voyage. Whatever good opinion an owner may have of the ma&s;ter, at the time of his appointment, he may find &s;ufficient rea&s;on afterwards to change his mind, and yet not be able to produce legal proof of his defection or inability. Fidelity or infidelity before a &s;ervice performed, is a matter of opinion only, and it would be an unrea&s;onable hard&s;hip to com|pel

an owner to continue what was originally a voluntary tru&s;t, in the hands of a per&s;on of whom he may have found &s;ub&s;equent rea&s;ons to believe that he may prove either unfaithful or un&s;kilful, although he may not be able to charge him with any po&s;itive offence: but I cannot &s;ee how this court can interfere to any effect. If the court &s;hould decree that the owners &s;hall receive the libellant on board, as ma&s;ter for the voyage con|tracted for; have not the owners a power to &s;ell their &s;hip, to lay her up, or totally change the voyage, and &s;o evade the decree? Or, if a ma&s;ter &s;hould refu&s;e to go the voyage for which he en|gaged, can this court compel a &s;pecific performance of the duties of his office? The remedy in both ca&s;es mu&s;t be in damages for a breach of contract, to which the common law is mo&s;t competent. Let the bill be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE libellant appealed from this judgment, and the cau&s;e was again fully argued before the judges of the high court of errors and appeals; but the li|bel was finally di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>

was told by &s;ome of the officers of the Iris, and al&s;o by &s;ome of the crew, that they had re|ceived their &s;hares of the four prizes afore&s;aid. It was al&s;o in proof, that the &s;aid four ve&s;&s;els had been adverti&s;ed for &s;ale at the coffee-hou&s;e in New York; and one of them, viz. the <HI>Hetty,</HI> was particularly remembered to have been adverti&s;ed, <HI>as a condemned prize:</HI> that the Neptune had been purcha&s;ed by merchants in New York; and that on the 13^t^h of May following &s;he was commi&s;&s;ioned as a privateer, by the name of the <HI>Nymph,</HI> to crui&s;e again&s;t the ve&s;&s;els of the United States of America.

<P>AGAINST the libel of the captors there was a claim filed, by Thomas Irwin and others, the for|mer owners, founded on the ordinance of congre&s;s of the 5th of December 1775, upon a &s;ugge&s;tion that this ve&s;&s;el could not have been condemned in the court of admiralty at New York previous to the re-capture: and in &s;upport of this &s;ugge&s;tion, a Briti&s;h act of parliament was exhibited, wherein is &s;et forth at large the mode in which the ve&s;|&s;els captured from the United States of America &s;hall be proceeded again&s;t in their courts of ad|miralty. Which act directs, that for the more

American ve&s;&s;el, taken in the &s;ituation of the brig Sarah, would have been confi&s;cated: that the plea, that &s;he was carrying &s;upplies to a pri&s;oner, ought to have been &s;upported by full and direct te&s;timony, to counteract the violent pre&s;umption to the contrary; but here was no direct te&s;timony to that point, and even &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ugge&s;tion to be true, as to the good intentions of the claimants, they had not conducted the bu&s;ine&s;s according to the known rules of war; for leave &s;hould have been fir&s;t obtained from the Briti&s;h commander at Charle&s;town, even for Bermu|dians to &s;end in &s;upplies to his pri&s;oners.

found on board at the time &s;he was taken. One of the&s;e cockets re&s;pected the &s;alt on board, and the other, the rum. The prize-ma&s;ter &s;wore that there were no other papers found in the &s;hip; and the gunner depo&s;ed, that the ve&s;&s;el was the pro|perty of <HI>Orm&s;on and Son,</HI> merchants in Liverpool, but that the &s;alt and rum were &s;hipped by a con|&s;ul from the court of Ru&s;&s;ia, at Liverpool, on ac|count of the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>ON this appearance of the cargo's being neu|tral property, the judge directed the attorney gene|ral to file and pro&s;ecute a claim for the &s;aid cargo in behalf of the her maje&s;ty Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e being fully argued, the judge declared him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<P>IT is not e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ent enquiry, whether it is probable or not, that there is at Liverpool &s;uch a character as a con&s;ul from the court of Ru&s;&s;ia, or what the rights and privileges of a con&s;ul are, by the law of nations; &s;ubjects which have perhaps been too largely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of this ar|gument. The only que&s;tion &s;eems to be, Is there &s;ufficient proof or not that this cargo was &s;hipped on account of her maje&s;ty of Ru&s;&s;ia, by her fac|tor
<PB N="44" REF="024407_0849_0FC730337AC0D520">
or agent at Liverpool? or, in other words, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the cargo neutral property or not?</P>
<P>THE te&s;timony, by which this que&s;tion is to be determined, &s;tands thus: On the one &s;ide are the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e cockets of Liverpool, certifying the &s;alt to have been &s;hipped by Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Gilbert and company,</HI> merchants, of Liverpool, and the rum to have been &s;hipped by a Mr. <HI>Roe,</HI> of the &s;ame place. On the other &s;ide we have the depo&s;ition of the gunner of the &s;hip, who belonged to her, as he &s;ays, at the time &s;he was taking in her lading at Liverpool; and expre&s;sly &s;wears, that both the &s;alt and rum were &s;hipped by a Ru&s;&s;ian con&s;ul at Liverpool, on account of the empre&s;s; and gives &s;everal collateral circum&s;tances to &s;upport the truth of his allegation.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;ugge&s;ted on the part of the claim|ant, that cu&s;tom-hou&s;e papers are often fallacious, and not conclu&s;ive evidence: that, for various mercantile rea&s;ons, borrowed names are often &s;ub|&s;tituted for the names of the real &s;hippers: that the depo&s;ition of the gunner is direct and ab&s;olute; and that from the &s;eeming mutilation of the log-book, and the papers forwarded being &s;o few, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of evidence on the part of the captors, in order to conceal
<PB N="45" REF="024407_0850_0FC7303500DF05C0">
from the court the real proprietor of this cargo; and that this &s;u&s;picion is further countenanced by the captors not &s;ending forward the captain or mate of the prize, as by his in&s;tructions he ought to have done.</P>
<P>HAVING con&s;idered, as well the&s;e, as the argu|ments adduced in behalf of the libellants, I am of opinion, That the te&s;timony of the gunner, found|ed on report only, concerning a matter in which he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any certain or ac|curate knowledge, however hone&s;tly or impartial|ly given, ought not to outweigh the certified de|claration of regular, official papers, unle&s;s &s;ome probable proof can be given, or circum&s;tances ad|duced to &s;hew, that the&s;e papers are, or may be, fallacious. There does not, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, appear any rea&s;on, why a Ru&s;&s;ian factor or agent &s;hould make u&s;e of the names of Liverpool mer|chants to cover his neutral property, which would have been &s;ecure from confi&s;cation without any &s;uch artifice: that a Briti&s;h merchant &s;hould, in the pre&s;ent war, &s;trive to conceal his property un|der a neutral name is a very natural &s;ugge&s;tion; but common &s;en&s;e will not allow the &s;uppo&s;ition, that a neutral owner, already &s;ecure, would ri&s;k pro|perty under the borrowed names of per&s;ons, who&s;e names alone would endanger confi&s;cation in ca&s;e
<PB N="46" REF="024407_0851_0FC7303A304613F8">
of capture. The condition of the papers, and the not &s;ending forward the captain or mate of the prize, induce a cen&s;ure of negligence on the part of the captors; but a wilful &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of evidence for the eva&s;ion of ju&s;tice, is a crime of &s;o heinous a nature, that it ought not to be pre&s;umed of any one, unle&s;s very powerful circum&s;tances &s;hall ju&s;|tify the pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>I adjuge, that the &s;hip Albion and her cargo, be condemned as lawful prize to the libellants.</P>

to cruize as privateers again&s;t the enemy; but Kelly, the ma&s;ter of the Living&s;ton, had no &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE council for the claimant urged, that it was a principle of law&mdash;that <HI>prizes taken by ve&s;&s;els not commi&s;&s;ioned, inured to the &s;overeign power,</HI> and exhibited a transfer from congre&s;s, of all their title to any &s;hare in this prize to Robert Morris; em|powering him to pro&s;ecute a claim, in the name of the United States, but for his own benefit. And the authorities cited in &s;upport of this doctrine, were <HI>Carthew</HI> 474, and 12th <HI>Modern</HI> 134.</P>
<P>BUT neither of the&s;e authorities apply &s;trictly to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. In the one, the prize was a wreck, &s;tranded on the &s;hore, and great part of the booty was taken on &s;hore by the crews of ve&s;&s;els not commi&s;&s;ioned: in the other, a ve&s;&s;el without a commi&s;&s;ion, took a prize, and carried her into a foreign port, where the captor &s;old her, and con|verted h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> money to his own u&s;e.</P>
<P>IN both ca&s;es, the booty was taken by per&s;ons not commi&s;&s;ioned to take; no ve&s;&s;els duly com|mi&s;&s;ioned a&s;&s;i&s;ting in, or being pre&s;ent at the time of the capture. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the prize was in fact taken by ve&s;&s;els regularly authorized
<PB N="49" REF="024407_0854_0FC7303EBB4CE880">
for the purpo&s;e, and the non-commi&s;&s;ioned ve&s;&s;el only in &s;ight at the time of the battle. In the ca|&s;es cited, no per&s;ons were pre&s;ent or a&s;&s;i&s;ting to whom the booty could be legally adjudged. Here the libellants, the real captors, were duly commi&s;|&s;ioned to take, and empowered by their commi&s;&s;i|ons, and the re&s;olve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of congre&s;s, to po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy the property &s;o legally taken.</P>
<P>A ve&s;&s;el not commi&s;&s;ioned mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a mere merchantman; and according to <HI>Lee,</HI> 237, if a merchant ve&s;&s;el meets an enemy in the cour&s;e of the voyage, and takes her, the prize &s;hall belong to the captor: but if &s;he goes out of her cour&s;e to &s;eek plunder, &s;he may be deemed a pi|rate. Now, it is not pretended that the Living&s;ton. took the prize in que&s;tion, on the contrary, it is in te&s;timony, that &s;he was running away whil&s;t the libellants were engaged with the enemy; and now claims a &s;hare of the prize, as having been in &s;ight at the time of the capture.</P>
<P>THE right under which a ve&s;&s;el in &s;ight may claim a &s;hare of a prize taken, is founded in a pre|&s;umption of law, which &s;uppo&s;es a ve&s;&s;el &s;o in &s;ight, and armed, and prepared for battle, to have indu|ced a &s;urrender. A pre&s;umption of law is a legal indulgence, and ought to be &s;trictly confined within
<PB N="50" REF="024407_0855_0FC73041038DBE88">
the rea&s;on of the pre&s;umption. But no authority has been adduced to &s;hew that this indulgence has been extended to a ve&s;&s;el not commi&s;&s;ioned to take, unarmed, and flying from the &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>THE Living&s;ton cannot claim under the pre|&s;umption of law, not being within the de&s;cription; nor the United States under the general doctrine; becau&s;e the prize was in fact taken by ve&s;&s;els duly authori&s;ed to take, which the Living&s;ton was not.

<PB N="51" REF="024407_0856_0FC730478DC93490">
obtained from congre&s;s a pa&s;&s;port or &s;afe conduct, for one Jo&s;eph Dean, to go to Jamaica and purcha&s;e a ve&s;&s;el there, which he was to load with "PRODUCE," on Penny's account, and to bring the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el and her cargo into any port of the United States not in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy.</P>
<P>IT appears that the &s;loop in que&s;tion was &s;o purcha&s;ed by Dean, and laden in part on Penny's account: that Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Fitch</HI> and <HI>Tyler,</HI> of Jamai|ca, being friendly to Dean, and privy to the pur|po&s;e for which he had purcha&s;ed the &s;loop, and the real de&s;tination of her voyage, put on board a quantity of rum and dry goods&mdash;the former, for the u&s;e of his mother, <HI>Jeru&s;ha Fitch</HI> and his &s;on re|ading at Bo&s;ton; and the latter for his friend <HI>Al|den Ba&s;s,</HI> at Bo&s;ton, who had charge of his (Tyler's) &s;on: that the &s;loop, &s;o laden, cleared out at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e in Jamaica for New York, then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h troops, and &s;ailed under convoy of a Briti&s;h fleet, as for New York: that when &s;he arrived on the American coa&s;t, the cap|tain made three attempts to run her into Che&s;apeak Bay, but without &s;ucce&s;s, notwith&s;tanding &s;everal manoeuvres to deceive the convoy. At length, being off the capes of Delaware, by &s;lacking &s;ail, under pretence of the ma&s;t's being &s;prung and a
<PB N="52" REF="024407_0857_0FC7304B113FB5E0">
&s;uppo&s;ed leak, the captain dexterou&s;ly left the fleet in the night, and ran up the Delaware, where his &s;loop was taken by the libellants.</P>
<P>IT has been admitted on the part of the libel|lants, that this &s;loop did really intend for &s;ome port in the United States not in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of of the enemy, and that the goods were <HI>bona fide</HI> &s;hipped as &s;et forth in the exhibits; and for the purpo&s;es alledged. But it is urged, that the &s;afe conduct of congre&s;s ought to be &s;trictly con&s;tru|ed&mdash;that dry goods are not the <HI>produce</HI> of a Ja|maica e&s;tate, and therefore not covered by the pa&s;&s;port: that <HI>Fitz</HI> and <HI>Tyler</HI> are Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; and the property of the goods &s;hipped by them not altered by the bills of lading, becau&s;e tho&s;e bills do not declare the u&s;e, the appropriation be|ing only de&s;ignated in private in&s;tructions, which, the parties might have revoked at plea&s;ure; and that under the&s;e circum&s;tances, being truly Briti&s;h property, they ought to be condemned as prize to the captor.</P>
<P>ON examiming the complexion of this cau&s;e, I find that the peculiar circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, require that it &s;hould be viewed in the liberal light of equity, rather than &s;quared by the &s;tricte&s;t rules
<PB N="53" REF="024407_0858_0FC7304D02B80B80">
of law. The intention of congre&s;s in granting the pa&s;&s;port appears to have been to permit Timo|thy Penny to import the produce of his e&s;tate in Jamaica, for the benefit of him&s;elf and family; and it is but rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that they meant this &s;hould be done in the mo&s;t beneficial manner. Had it been otherwi&s;e, congre&s;s would not have ve&s;ted an important re&s;triction on a &s;ingle word of equivocal con&s;truction; but would have in|&s;erted a prohibitory clau&s;e in the pa&s;&s;port. As to the law re&s;pecting bills of lading, it &s;eems not to apply fully to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, becau&s;e the whole arrangement of this bu&s;ine&s;s was framed with a view to cover the property from &s;eizure by Bri|ti&s;h captors, and not according to the cu&s;tom of merchants in open commerce. The&s;e bills of la|ding and in&s;tructions were altogether confidential.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed, that Fitch and Tyler, re&s;i|ding in Jamaica, and being profe&s;&s;edly Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, had no right to &s;hip goods for the United States; and as their part of the cargo is not cove|red by the pa&s;&s;port, they ran great ri&s;k of confi&s;|cation into whatever hands they might fall. If it could be made appear, that the&s;e goods were to have been &s;old for their per&s;onal benefit, they would doubtle&s;s be prize to the captors. But as it is manife&s;t from the te&s;timony, and admitted

by coun&s;el for the libellants, that the goods &s;hipped by Fitch were for the &s;upport of his aged mother and his &s;on at Bo&s;ton, &s;ubjects of the United States, and that tho&s;e &s;hipped by Tyler were for u&s;e of his &s;on, under the care of his friend Alden Ba&s;s, al&s;o American &s;ubjects, or to di&s;charge debts already contracted on their accounts, it &s;eems to be one of tho&s;e ca&s;es to which the &s;trictne&s;s of law ought not to be rigorou&s;ly applied&mdash;more e&s;pecially as there is little rea&s;on to apprehend that lenity here may form a dangerous precedent for hereafter, becau&s;e a like ca&s;e will probably never occur again&mdash;pa&s;&s;ports of this kind being very rare.</P>

<P>THE Brig Gloce&s;ter had been captured by Ro|ger Kean in the privateer Holker, and condemn|ed as prize to the captors. The mar&s;hal being a|bout to make di&s;tribution of the booty among&s;t the crew, according to the li&s;t handed in by cap|tain Kean, was notified to &s;tay in his hands 25 &s;hares of the &s;aid prize, claimed by Patrick Ma|hoon, and others, as being a part of the crew belonging to, and concerned in the &s;aid privateer Holker. Notwith&s;tanding that their names were not to be found in the captain's return; the libel, now before the court is for the&s;e 25 &s;hares.</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e appear, by the te&s;timony exhibited, to be as follows.</P>
<P>THE printed articles of the privateer Holker were &s;et up at a common hou&s;e of rendezvous for
<PB N="56" REF="024407_0861_0FC73056BAEAD708">
the enli&s;tment of privateer's men, according to cu|&s;tom. The libellants, in common with many o|thers, &s;igned the&s;e articles, and made the nece&s;|&s;ary preparations for the crui&s;e. When the Hol|ker was ready to &s;ail, the libellants, with the re&s;t of the crew, repaired on board by order of the captain, and the ve&s;&s;el &s;et &s;ail. When they arri|ved at Che&s;ter on the Delaware (15 miles below Philadelphia) captain Kean mu&s;tered his crew up|on deck, called over their names as &s;ub&s;cribed to the articles, and then, without giving any rea&s;on for his conduct, &s;elected Patrick Mahoon and 24 others, and ordered them on &s;hore; refu&s;ing to let them proceed on the crui&s;e, and when they ear|ne&s;tly &s;olicited to be continued on board he for|cibly drove them away, and the captain pro|ceeded on his voyage, leaving the libellants behind.</P>
<P>A few days after Kean again called his crew to|gether, and produced to them another printed co|py of articles, which he urged them to &s;ign. Some objected, ob&s;erving that they had already &s;igned, and did not under&s;tand &s;igning two &s;ets of articles for the &s;ame crui&s;e; but the captain enforced them with threats and even blows, to &s;ign the new ar|ticles; declaring at the &s;ame time, that his view
<PB N="57" REF="024407_0862_0FC730594D137538">
was to exclude tho&s;e men whom he had left be|hind from having any &s;hare of the prizes they might take. The Brig Gloce&s;ter was captured during this crui&s;e.</P>
<P>THE re&s;pondents have re&s;ted their cau&s;e prin|cipally on a plea to the juri&s;diction of this court; alledging that the injury, if any, was exclu&s;ively of common law cognizance; becau&s;e the libel|lants claim was founded in articles executed on &s;hore, within the body of a country: that although the admiralty could determine the que&s;tion of prize or no prize; yet it could not determine to who&s;e u&s;e, having no juri&s;diction in di&s;putes between owner and owner, owner and captain, or captain and mariner, except only in the ca&s;e of a mariner's wages, which is allowed out of &s;pecial favour, and not of right, further than as <HI>communis error f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cit jus.</HI></P>
<P>THE facts being fully a&s;certained, and not con|troverted, no difficulty ari&s;es from that quarter. It is in proof that captain Kean forced the libel|lants on &s;hore after the voyage was begun, and compelled the remainder of the crew to &s;ign the new articles, with a veiw to exclude the libellants from any advantage they might claim under the
<PB N="58" REF="024407_0863_0FC7305D43E8CF08">
former; and it is contended that this court cannot redre&s;s the injury, becau&s;e the &s;uit re&s;pects <HI>damages,</HI> which the common law alone can a&s;certain. The truth however is, that the parties do not &s;ue for redre&s;s or an injury; but for their &s;hares of a prize legally condemned to the u&s;e <HI>of the owners, officers, and crew, and of all per&s;ons belonging to, or concer|ned in the privateer Holker:</HI> of which crew, they &s;ay, they are a part. The articles of enli&s;tment, ex|ecuted on &s;hore, is no bar to the juri&s;diction of the admiralty. Mariners are generally engaged on &s;hore, and always &s;ue for their wages in this court. In the one ca&s;e the mariners are paid by monthly wages, or by the run, in the other by a &s;hare of the booty taken. There is the &s;ame rea&s;on in both ca&s;es. But I am of opinion that the articles are not the true foundation of a &s;eaman's claim. If one or more mariners &s;hould enter on board a ve&s;&s;el, with the knowledge and con&s;ent of the ma&s;ter, &s;hould receive his orders and perform the duties of the &s;taion, they would be entitled to cu|&s;tomary wages, or a proportion of the booty ta|ken in common with the re&s;t of the crew, although they had &s;igned no articles at all, the right is not founded in the articles, but in the &s;ervice.</P>

<HEAD>PRINGLE AND SHEE vre&s;us THE ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Claim by Charles Phile.</HEAD>
<P>THE Brig Elizabeth arrived with a cargo of dry goods on the 26th of February 1781 at Glou|ce&s;ter, in the river Delaware, from Cork in Ire|land: being the property of merchants of Cork, &s;ubjects of the king of great Britain when there was war between Great Britain and America.</P>
<P>CHARLES PHILE, the claimant hearing of this arrival, procured a deputation from the naval offi|cer of the port of Philadelphia, dated the 27th of February; and on the &s;ame day went down to Glou|ce&s;ter, and &s;eized the ve&s;&s;el under authority of his deputation, and by virtue of an act of a&s;&s;embly of this &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="024407_0867_0FC73069C4F85AA8">IN this manner Phile po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the ve&s;&s;el, and afterwards had her brought up to the city, &s;ecured her at the wharf, and placed a guard on board.</P>
<P>AFTER this, viz. on the 2d of March the libel|lants entered on board this ve&s;&s;el, and by virtue of an ordinance of congre&s;s of the 26th of December 1776, authori&s;ing
<Q>the people of the country, or detachments from the army, to make prize of the ve&s;&s;els and goods of the enemy that may happen to be taken near the &s;hore,</Q>&mdash;&s;eized the brig and her cargo as <HI>lawful prize,</HI> and on the &s;ame day made report to the judge of admiralty, that they had &s;o done. On the 6th they filed their libel in the regi&s;ter's office; and on the &s;ame day a writ of attachment i&s;&s;ued, and the mar&s;hal of the court took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her in behalf of the libellants.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS, viz. on the 10th of March, Charles Phile entered his claim in this court for the ve&s;&s;el and cargo, as a captor al&s;o, under the &s;ame ordinance of congre&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE tran&s;actions, as to the manner and time of the performance, &s;tand uncontroverted by the par|ties. Of the remaining te&s;timony exhibited in
<PB N="63" REF="024407_0868_0FC7306AFB179428">
this cau&s;e, there is but one circum&s;tance of any im|portance, viz. when Phile made the &s;eizure on the 27th of February, he was a&s;ked by the captain of the brig, by what authority he did it? and if it was for congre&s;s? To which he an&s;wered NO, <HI>it was for the naval officer.</HI> Then &s;hewing the captain his deputation, he &s;aid, <HI>that was his authority.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the materials upon which this cau&s;e has been argued, and it is urged in behalf of the claimant, that notwith&s;tanding the prior date of Mr. Pringle's libel, Phile was in fact the fir&s;t and real captor, and was in the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prize at the time of the &s;eizure made by the libel|lants: that although the claimant made his &s;eizure by virtue of the deputation of the naval officer, and under the act of a&s;&s;embly, in which indeed he was mi&s;taken in point of law, becau&s;e the act does not touch the ve&s;&s;el, but the cargo only; yet be|ing &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he acquired a right which could not be injured by his error in judgment, and was good again&s;t any fellow-&s;ubject: that this right is founded on two principles, viz. <HI>occupancy,</HI> in the civil, and the doctrine of <HI>remitter,</HI> in the common law.</P>
<P>UNDER the fir&s;t, it is &s;aid, that goods belong|ing to an enemy, being out of the protection of the
<PB N="64" REF="024407_0869_0FC73071F05828E0">
law, may be con&s;idered as <HI>bona vacantia,</HI> and he who can fir&s;t get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion acquires a right in them by <HI>occupancy;</HI> and that this doctrine is the only foundation on which the right of capture is built: and, under the &s;econd, that, where a per&s;on ob|tains peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property by an in&s;uf|ficient title, having a more ancient and better title, the law will <HI>remit</HI> him to his better title, and con&s;ider him as holding under that in prefe|rence. Both which doctrines are &s;aid to apply in favour of the claimant in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, ina&s;|much as he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;el before the &s;eizure made by the libellants and held her by <HI>oc|cupancy;</HI> and that having a good right under the or|dinance of congre&s;s to make prize of goods be|longing to the enemy, and taken near the &s;hore, although in fact he &s;eized the &s;ame by virtue of his deputation from the naval officer, yet being &s;o po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, the law will not remit him to his better title.</P>
<P>ON the contrary it has been urged&mdash;That when the claimant fir&s;t went on board this ve&s;&s;el, he &s;tood in a two fold capacity, as a militia man of the country, and as the deputy of the naval officer, and that the rights and powers of the&s;e characters are as perfectly di&s;tinct in law as if they exi&s;ted in two different per&s;ons: that when he was a&s;|ked in which capacity he meant to act, he expre&s;sly declared that he made the &s;eizure in behalf of the
<PB N="65" REF="024407_0870_0FC7307406DDACD8">
naval officer: that when an agent &s;o &s;ituate hath made his election, and afterwards finds him&s;elf in the wrong, he cannot have recour&s;e to his better power to confirm an act done by an in&s;ufficient one: that Charles Phile, the pre&s;ent naval officer, &s;eiz|ed the ve&s;&s;el, but Charles Phile, the militia man, who mu&s;t, in the eye of the law, be con&s;idered as a different per&s;on, did not exerci&s;e the power given him by the ordinance of congre&s;s, and made no capture in that capacity, and therefore the ve&s;&s;el remained liable to capture by any militia man who &s;hould think fit to make u&s;e of the right ve&s;ted in him by the ordinance, notwith&s;tanding he might find her in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the naval officer, or of his deputy, who, as &s;uch, had no power to hold her under the act of a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>THAT Phile cannot claim by <HI>occupancy</HI> more than the two men who rowed him down the ri|ver, and went on board with him; and that the doctrine of <HI>remitter</HI> does not apply, becau&s;e the ancient and better right alluded to, was not a right peculiar to the claimant, but which every militia man in the country held in as full force as him&s;elf, by virtue of the ordinance of congre&s;s. And final|ly, that be that ancient right what it may, the claim|ant di&s;avowed and rejected it by his voluntary elec|tion, which throws the whole doctrine of remitter
<PB N="66" REF="024407_0871_0FC730758064EBF0">
out of the que&s;tion, which is &s;o purely an opera|tion of law under particular circum&s;tances, that the interference of the party is fatal to its effect.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion which fir&s;t pre&s;ents in this cau&s;e is&mdash;Whether the &s;eizure made by the claimant, as deputy naval officer, operated as a capture of the <HI>ve&s;&s;el</HI> under the ordinance of congre&s;s or not? It is certain, that when Phile entered on board this brig, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two di&s;tinct powers. By the one, derived from the act of a&s;&s;embly, he might have made a &s;eizure of the cargo only; by the other, founded in the ordinance of congre&s;s, he might have taken as prize, both the ve&s;&s;el and cargo. In this &s;ituation the claimant explicitly di&s;|avowed and rejected his right under the ordinance, not only by words, but by unequivocal actions; and the law will not now force upon him a right &s;o deliberately di&s;claimed, to the exclu&s;ion of ano|ther claiming under the &s;ame right, formally and expre&s;sly exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, that no advantage ought to be taken of the ignorance of the claimant on a &s;udden emer|gency. But, be&s;ides that his procuring a deputation from the naval officer, and going four miles down the river to execute his purpo&s;e, cannot be called a &s;udden act, his &s;ub&s;equent conduct fully evinces
<PB N="67" REF="024407_0872_0FC73077011B0520">
a deliberate determination of the right on which he meant to depend. He made the &s;eizure in be|half of the naval officer, under the act of a&s;&s;embly, on the 27th of February, and held the property by that title, to the 10th of March following, du|ring which time no libel or information was filed by him in the admiralty office, no &s;hip's papers produced, nor the ve&s;&s;el put by him into the mar|&s;hal's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as a prize taken from the enemy. The&s;e circum&s;tances operate &s;trongly again&s;t the claimant's being con&s;idered as a captor under the ordinance of congre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT further, even &s;uppo&s;ing him to have been the fir&s;t and real captor of this ve&s;&s;el and her cargo under the ordinance, there yet remains a legal ob&s;tacle to his enjoying the prize; &s;ince what|ever right he might have acquired as a captor, he forfeited it by his &s;ub&s;equent conduct. In the ad|miralty law of this &s;tate (p. 314) it is enacted,
<Q>If any per&s;on who &s;hall have charge of, or bring a prize into this port, &s;hall neglect or refu&s;e to de|liver up the &s;ame to the mar&s;hal of the court of admiralty, and libel her within three days after her arrival, &s;uch per&s;on &s;hall forfeit all his inter|e&s;t in the &s;aid prize to the u&s;e of the common|wealth, and be &s;ubjected to the penalties of con|tempt,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.
It is evident, therefore, that
<PB N="68" REF="024407_0873_0FC7307F61F534F0">
the cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> did not con&s;ider him&s;elf as the captor of a prize, till after the libel fled by Pringle and Shee, otherwi&s;e he would have taken care to com|ply with the injunctions of the admiralty law.</P>
<P>AS to the doctrines of <HI>occupancy</HI> and <HI>remitter,</HI> if they operated at all it mu&s;t have been at the mo|ment the claimant fir&s;t entered on board this ve&s;&s;el; and if &s;o, why does he not libel for the cargo as well as the ve&s;&s;el? But I am of opinion that no force can warp tho&s;e doctrines to fit the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A claim filed in behalf of the &s;hippers of the cargo; al&s;o a claim in behalf of the owners of the &s;hip.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;hip <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> belonging to Brandlight and Sons, merchants in Am&s;terdam, &s;ailed from the Texel on the 9th of January, 1780, bound for the i&s;land of St. Eu&s;tatius. This voyage was interrupt|ed by &s;tre&s;s of weather, which obliged her to put into Li&s;bon, where &s;he remained &s;ome months to refit, but afterwards arrived at St. Eu&s;tatius. From St. Eu&s;tatius &s;he &s;ailed for the i&s;land of Dominica, where &s;he arrived on the 1&s;t of October, 1780. In March, 1781, &s;he &s;ailed from Dominica for Am|&s;terdam, with a valuable cargo of &s;ugar and coffee,
<PB N="71" REF="024407_0876_0FC73083BAC9C630">
&s;hipped by &s;undry per&s;ons, certified to be <HI>capitu|lants in the i&s;land of Dominica;</HI> which cargo was con&s;igned to Me&s;&s;rs. Brandlight and Sons, of Am|&s;terdam, the owners of the ve&s;&s;el. Soon after the commencement of her voyage from Dominica, &s;he. was captured by a Briti&s;h armed ve&s;&s;el, and taken as prize into <HI>Nevis,</HI> where admiral Rodney exa|mined her papers, and thereupon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her. She again proceeded on her voyage, but was after|wards captured by another Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el, from whom &s;he was re-captured by an American priva|teer; from this privateer &s;he was again taken by a Briti&s;h &s;hip, and finally retaken from her by Peter Miller, the libellant in this cau&s;e, and &s;ent into the port of Philadelphia. It is not contended but that in each and every of the captures and re-captures, &s;he remained more than 24 hours in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conqueror. Being thus found in the hands of the enemy, and taken from them by force of arms, the libellants pray that both &s;hip and cargo may be condemned as lawful prize and booty of war.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>BUT it has been contended in behalf of the claimants&mdash;That it appears in te&s;timony that the i&s;land of Dominica did on the 7th of September, 1778, &s;urrender by capitulation to the marquis <HI>de
<PB N="72" REF="024407_0877_0FC7308C37202AD8">
Bouill&eacute;,</HI> general of the French forces in the Wind|ward I&s;lands&mdash;that by the terms of this capitulati|on, all the property and e&s;tates in Dominica, with their produce were &s;ecured to the inhabitants, and protected from confi&s;cation; particularly by the 17th article, in the&s;e words&mdash;<Q>The merchants of the i&s;land may receive ve&s;&s;els to their addre&s;s. from all parts of the world (Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els ex|cepted) without their being confi&s;cated; and they may &s;ell their merchandize, and may carry on their trade, and the port &s;hall be entirely free for them for that purpo&s;e, paying the cu&s;tomary duties paid in the French i&s;lands.</Q>
And it is alledged, that this privilege and protection was ex|tended to ab&s;ent per&s;ons having property or con|cerns in the i&s;land, by virtue of the 9th article of the &s;ame capitulation in the&s;e words&mdash;<Q>The ab|&s;ent inhabitants, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ervice of his Britannic maje&s;ty, &s;hall be maintained in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of their e&s;tates, which &s;hall be managed for them by their attor|nies.</Q>
That the&s;e United States being in &s;trict alliance with the court of France, are bound by the terms of every capitulation, convention, or treaty, which the court of France, or any per&s;on or per&s;ons under that authority, &s;hall make in the cour&s;e of the war, the war being a common cau&s;e, and both allies principals in the conduct of it:&mdash;
<PB N="73" REF="024407_0878_0FC7308E492C2500">
that it was al&s;o in proof, that the king of England, by his proclamation, dated in December; 1780, extended the effects of the capitulation of Domi|nica, to Dutch ve&s;&s;els for four months, notwith|&s;tanding the rupture between Great Britain and Holland, by the capture of St. Eu&s;tatius: and, that this &s;hip, under the &s;anction of the &s;aid capi|tulation which &s;ecured her and her cargo from capture by the French or Americans, and under the &s;aid proclamation, which protected her from Briti&s;h capture, &s;ailed from Dominica, with the property of capitulants on board; and that the pa&s;&s;port of mon&s;ieur <HI>Duchilleau,</HI> the French go|vernor of Dominica, endor&s;ed on the manife&s;to of the cargo, ought to protect this property from be|ing made prize of by the friends and allies of France.</P>
<P>IT has been further in&s;i&s;ted&mdash;That a re-captor acquires no other right than what the captor had; inferring that as the Briti&s;h captor could not have procured a condemnation (as appears by the acqui|tal of admiral Rodney) neither can an American re-captor make this ve&s;&s;el legal prize&mdash;that the Bri|ti&s;h captain &s;hould be con&s;idered as a pirate, and that the law is, that goods taken by pirates, and again retaken from them, &s;hall be re&s;tored to the former owner&mdash;that if it &s;hould be objected, that mo&s;t of
<PB N="74" REF="024407_0879_0FC7308FC116ABD8">
the real con&s;ignees of this cargo are not inhabi|tants of Dominica, and therefore not within the capitulation; it is an&s;wered, that article the 9th extends the operation of this capitulation to ab&s;ent inhabitants, even &s;uch as are in the &s;ervice of the king of Great Britain having property in the i&s;land, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s may be tran&s;acted by attornies; and that if the attorney is an inhabitant, and &s;igned the capitulation, it is the &s;ame thing in effect as if the principal had done it. And, la&s;tly, that although no expre&s;s authority can be produced to prove di|rectly that allies in war are bound by the capitula|tions, conventions, and treaties of each other, re|ciprocally; yet a &s;triking analogy may be found in the ca&s;e of <HI>ran&s;om.</HI> That it cannot be denied, but that if a French ve&s;&s;el takes a prize, and <HI>ran|&s;oms</HI> her for a limited time, the ran&s;om bill would protect the property from capture and condemna|tion by the Americans. If, therefore, the act of an individual captain of a French privateer can &s;creen the property of an enemy from an ally, much more &s;hould the &s;olemn capitulation of a French general with the whole inhabitants of a captured i&s;land bind the &s;ame ally.</P>
<P>TO this it has been replied; that the &s;hip <HI>Re|&s;olution</HI> and her cargo were found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy, who held the &s;ame by force as
<PB N="75" REF="024407_0880_0FC7309660927488">
their property for more than 24 hours which brings the ca&s;e &s;trictly within the ordinance of congre&s;s of February la&s;t, which excludes any claims of former owners after a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 24 hours by the enemy: that we have no bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire by what right the enemy became po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed: it is &s;ufficient for us that we found it there: that the doctrine re&s;pecting pirates does not apply, becau&s;e the Briti&s;h as a &s;overeign nation has an undoubted right to wage war, and to take prizes, which pirates have not: that if any &s;ubject of a &s;overeign power takes unlawfully, let him or his prince an&s;wer the wrong, the re-captors at war with them being altogether blamele&s;s, who&s;e right to take from an enemy cannot be doubted: that it appears evidently by the letters and other exhibits in this cau&s;e, that this cargo is in fact Briti&s;h property, and not the property of the inhabitants of Dominica; and although con|&s;igned to merchants in Am&s;terdam, the nett pro|ceeds were to be remitted to merchants in London, and other parts of the Briti&s;h dominion: that it is ab&s;urd and untrue to &s;uppo&s;e that the benefits of the capitulation were de&s;igned to extend to London merchants who had never been inhabitants of the i&s;land of Dominica, and who are and will remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, aiding, by their
<PB N="76" REF="024407_0881_0FC7309802D44DE0">
wealth and influence, in the war again&s;t France and her allies: that the captulation included on|ly real inhabitants, either pre&s;ent on the i&s;land, or ab&s;ent on bu&s;ine&s;s at the time, and placed them in a &s;tate of perfect neutrality with re&s;pect to the war; a character which can by no means be ap|plied to the real con&s;ignees of this cargo: that if the effects of this capitulation were to be thus extended, France would have obtained a conque&s;t which can produce nothing but expence, trouble, and lo&s;s to her, but will tend to &s;trengthen and enrich the enemy; and that it would be for the pre&s;ent, the intere&s;t of Great Britain to &s;urren|der all her We&s;t-India i&s;lands upon the &s;ame terms.</P>
<P>IT has been further urged by the coun&s;el for the libellants, that allies are not mutually bound by every <HI>ex parte</HI> treaty or convention: that con|&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary to include one in the engage|ment made by the other; as for in&s;tance, in a truce or ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities: that France does not deem her&s;elf &s;o bound, is evident from her conduct with re&s;pect to Bermuda and the Ba|hama i&s;lands, who&s;e property congre&s;s have ex|empted from capture and condemnation by Ame|ricans; yet their ve&s;&s;els are confi&s;cated in the

<HEAD>JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS cau&s;e, &s;o far as it re&s;pects the cargo of the &s;hip <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> re&s;ts principally on one que|&s;tion, viz. whether the United States by their al|liance with France, are, or are not to be con&s;ide|red as parties in the capitulation made by the Marquis De Bouill&eacute; with the inhabitants of Do|minica.
<PB N="80" REF="024407_0885_0FC730A4C8F46778">
No authority has been produced, and I believe that none can be, to &s;hew that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lies are mutually bound in all ca&s;es. It is manife&s;t, that it is not generally &s;o under&s;tood; becau&s;e it is u&s;ual in forming treaties of alliance to in&s;ert &s;pecial clau&s;es &s;pecifying tho&s;e ca&s;es, wherein the pro|mi&s;es and engagements of the one &s;hall bind the other: for it would be a very dangerous doctrine that &s;hould bind &s;overeign powers in engagements to which they had neither expre&s;sly or implicitly given con&s;ent, or that one ally &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily become a party in the conventions which the ge|nerals and officers of the other may, under particu|lar &s;traits and circum&s;tances, make with the com|mon enemy, unle&s;s the ally be mentioned in the convention, and the terms thereof be afterwards acceded to by him. Thus, in the ca&s;e of Domini|ca, had governor Stuart, when he &s;urrendered the i&s;land to the marquis de Bouill&eacute; expected that the United States &s;hould be bound by the terms of the capitulation, he would have made this one of the articles, and not entru&s;ted &s;o important a point to a &s;peculative que&s;tion, how far one ally may or may not be virtually bound by the engagements of the other. This, however, he has not done, either becau&s;e it would imply an acknowledgment of the &s;overeignty of the United States, or becau&s;e he deemed the objects of the capitulation to be li|mited
<PB N="81" REF="024407_0886_0FC730A680196018">
to property within the i&s;land. Be this as it may, the Briti&s;h could not rea&s;onably complain that the French had violated the articles of the capitulation &s;hould the Americans take the goods of the inhabitants of Dominica found upon the high &s;eas, becau&s;e &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance made no part of the &s;tipulation.
<Q>If he who can and ought to have explained him&s;elf clearly and plainly, has not done it, it is the wor&s;e for him; he cannot be allowed to introduce &s;ub&s;equent re&s;trictions which he has not expre&s;&s;ed.</Q>
Vattel, B. 2. ch. 17. &s;ec. 174.</P>
<P>BUT whatever doubts there may be of the right of Americans to take the property of the people of Dominica under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, there can be none of taking Briti&s;h property, wherever found, without any danger of impairing the friend&s;hip of our good ally. And from a &s;cru|tiny of the papers found on board this ve&s;&s;el, there is &s;trong rea&s;on to believe that this cargo, howe|ver artificially covered, is, in fact, Briti&s;h pro|perty.</P>
<P>AS to the general doctrine re&s;pecting allies, the ca&s;e of Bermudas is, I think, &s;trong in point. The ve&s;&s;els of that i&s;land were by congre&s;s exempted from capture by Americans, and yet the French
<PB N="82" REF="024407_0887_0FC730AC82DBE730">
made prize of them whenever they could; nor was it ever &s;ugge&s;ted, that they had thereby violat|ed the faith of the alliance. Had the Briti&s;h ex|pected, or France de&s;ired, that the United States &s;hould be parties in the capitulation of Dominica, it cannot be doubted, but that this would have been made one of the terms of that capitulation, or tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> France would, e'er this, have &s;ignified her de&s;ire to congre&s;s, and that congre&s;s would have in&s;truct|ed the ma&s;ters of privateers as to this matter.</P>
<P>HAVING made no national agreement to &s;pare the property of the people of Dominica, when found on the high &s;eas, much le&s;s are we bound to re&s;cue it from the hands of an enemy at our ri&s;k and expence, in order to re&s;tore it, &s;alvage free, to their u&s;e. This would be to put them on a bet|ter footing than our own merchants, who&s;e pro|perty, after 24 hours po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the enemy, would be confi&s;cated to the re-captor, whereas it is contended that no confi&s;cation whatever &s;hould pa&s;s on the property of the people of Dominica.</P>
<P>BEING fully &s;atisfied as to this general point, it renders a minute di&s;play of the &s;triking contradic|tions between the bills of lading and letters of ad|vice, and other papers found on board this ve&s;&s;el, the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. Many of them are manife&s;tly
<PB N="83" REF="024407_0888_0FC730AE6FE94DF8">
fraudulent&punc; and although the property is carefully wrapped in neutral covers, the nett proceeds ap|pear to be finally intended for &s;ubjects of Great Britain, re&s;iding at London or el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the king of England's procla|mation, I conceive that it is founded on partial, not on general grounds. Were it not that this, with four or five other Dutch ve&s;&s;els were at this time to &s;ail from Dominica, freighted with the property of Briti&s;h merchants, it is more than probable that this proclamation had never been publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>I adjudge that the cargo of the &s;hip Re&s;olution be condemned as lawful prize to the libellants; and that the &s;hip Re&s;olution, with her tackle, apparel and furniture be re&s;tored to Brandlight and Sons, merchants of Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>N. B. The claimants appealed from this decree; and, after long argument, the judges of appeal re|ver&s;ed the decree, &s;o far as the &s;ame re&s;pected the condemnation of the cargo, which they fully ac|quitted, upon the &s;hippers paying freight to the owners of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>THERE was afterwards a re-hearing of this cau&s;e before the court of appeal, on a &s;ugge&s;tion
<PB N="84" REF="024407_0889_0FC730B174C1DC00">
of new te&s;timony having been found among&s;t &s;ome papers taken in a &s;hip (the Er&s;ten) bound from O&s;tend to Dominica: but the court adhered to their judgment; except only as to &s;ome part of the cargo, which was condemned on account of irregularities in the bills of lading, and letters of advice, re&s;pecting tho&s;e particular articles.</P>

<PB N="85" REF="024407_0890_0FC730B2406A3B50">
the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were yet in company, they di&s;covered the brig <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy,</HI> a ve&s;&s;el belonging to the enemy, and got to windward of her. The &s;hip then bore down upon, and took the prize; but the &s;loop, without changing her cour&s;e, pro|ceeded on her voyage. It is al&s;o in evidence, that the &s;loop was ob&s;erved by the crew of the prize, eight or ten minutes before &s;he &s;urrendered, at the di&s;tance of about &s;ix miles. Whereupon, the own|er, who is &s;ingly concerned in the &s;loop, has filed a claim, in the name of Samuel Young, <HI>qui tam,</HI> for a &s;hare of the prize, as being in &s;ight at the time of the capture, under the general rule of law.</P>
<P>AGAINST this claim it has been urged, that the &s;loop ought to have no &s;hare in this prize, becau&s;e it is in te&s;timony, that &s;he not only did nothing to|wards the capture, but, in fact, avoided it, not al|tering her cour&s;e, or manife&s;ting the lea&s;t intention to be con&s;idered as a joint captor; in&s;i&s;ting, that an intention to po&s;&s;e&s;s is requi&s;ite to the acquire|ment of property&mdash;that although by the rule of law, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to enquire how far a ve&s;&s;el in &s;ight, did or did not contribute to the capture of a prize, yet &s;ome attempt, &s;ome inclination, to take, ought to appear, otherwi&s;e the law will not force property on tho&s;e who voluntarily abandon it; and

the ca&s;e of <HI>Rice</HI> ver&s;us <HI>Taylor</HI> was particularly referred to, and relied upon. (Vide p. 16.)</P>
<P>ARBITRARY rules and pre&s;umptions of law are e&s;tabli&s;hed in profound wi&s;dom, and are the re&s;ult of much experience. Pa&s;&s;ing by the uncertain equity of certain ca&s;es, they look only to general ju&s;tice. All that is nece&s;&s;ary in the application of them is to a&s;certain whether the ca&s;e comes within the rule or not. If it does, the rule ought not to be violated, nor &s;hould any evidence be admitted to defeat its operation; becau&s;e the law, delighting in certainty, will not &s;uffer an inve&s;tigation which can occa&s;ion contradictory te&s;timony, perjury, and endle&s;s litigation.</P>
<P>IN the ca&s;e of <HI>Rice</HI> ver&s;us <HI>Taylor,</HI> the <HI>jury found</HI> that the claimant's ve&s;&s;el did not, by her pre&s;ence, contribute to the &s;urrender of the prize; her &s;i|tuation rendering it in fact impo&s;&s;ible; and, there|fore, the claim was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the ca&s;e not coming within the verge of the legal pre&s;umption. But no &s;uch impo&s;&s;ibility appears in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Had the enemy been a match for the &s;hip, or made an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, the &s;loop was &s;uffici|ently near, and in a capacity to join her force. But as the prize was not able to maintain a conte&s;t with the &s;hip, it is to be pre&s;umed that the &s;loop's con|tinuing
<PB N="87" REF="024407_0892_0FC730BC74D26660">
her cour&s;e, was not an abandonment of any &s;hare or concern in the prize, but becau&s;e that &s;he &s;aw that her a&s;&s;i&s;tance was altogether unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE &s;uppo&s;ed want of an intention to take, is not &s;ufficient to exclude the claimants from a &s;hare of the prize. The claim filed in this cau&s;e is proof of at lea&s;t an intention to po&s;&s;e&s;s whatever the law may award. And although it has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that this &s;uit is in fact brought by one of the own|ers, in the name of the captain and crew of the &s;loop Jane, who are ab&s;ent, and had no intention of making &s;uch claim, yet the court will not allow the di&s;tinction, but con&s;ider captain Young and his mariners as pro&s;ecuting their &s;uit by their proctor.</P>
<P>NEITHER is there any rea&s;on why the circum|&s;tance of the &s;loop's being under the convoy of the &s;hip, &s;hould affect the right of the claimants. The a&s;&s;i&s;tance which one ve&s;&s;el may give another in battle is the rea&s;on of the law, and this rea&s;on is as applicable to ve&s;&s;els under convoy as to any o|thers. Whenever two ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ame nation are in company, they are under reciprocal protec|tion, and mutually bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other: but when a ve&s;&s;el of &s;uperior force &s;ails out of her in|tended cour&s;e, or is purpo&s;ely &s;ent for the protecti|on of another, the owners of the latter &s;hould make

recompence for the &s;ervice; but this will not ex|clude the protected ve&s;&s;el from tho&s;e rights which her force, &s;mall as it may be, may entitle her to, and which the general rule of law a&s;&s;igns without di&s;tinction.</P>

her; whereupon the captain (or owners) publi&s;h|ed an adverti&s;ement, calling upon the officers, &s;eamen, and mariners, belonging to the <HI>Ri&s;ing Sun,</HI> to repair on board by a certain day, in or|der to complete the crui&s;e. One third of the crew, however, neglecting to appear, the owners and officers agreed to break up the crui&s;e, opened a new rendezvous, and enli&s;ted a crew under a new &s;et of articles. The &s;hip &s;ailed on this &s;econd crui&s;e, the four months of the fir&s;t having not yet expired. Soon after her la&s;t &s;ailing &s;he captured the Tri&s;tiam Shandy, and the Dim&s;dale, both which were condemned as prize.

<P>AS this cau&s;e touches a general doctrine, viz. how far owners are ju&s;tifiable in breaking up a crui&s;e, without the con&s;ent of all concerned, it wears a face of con&s;iderable importance.

full force with re&s;pect to the contracting parties. And this contract is not made with the officers and crew as an aggregate body, but with each mariner individually. Upon this ground, I think the contract cannot be totally di&s;&s;olved (as hath been contended) by the will of any majority on either &s;ide, however great. If a &s;ingle mariner withholds his con&s;ent, and the crui&s;e is broke up by the re&s;t of the concerned, and a new crui&s;e commenced, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, this mu&s;t be done, &s;ubject to the legal claim of the uncon&s;en|ting mariner, of wages or prize money that may accrue during the term of the fir&s;t crui&s;e for which he contracted.

<P>THE brig <HI>Su&s;annah,</HI> belonging to George Gibbs, cleared out from the naval office in the port of Rhode I&s;land, and &s;ailed with a cargo on board, as for Hi&s;paniola, but in fact for Turk's I&s;lands. Being on her voyage &s;he was di&s;covered, pur&s;ued, and captured by Jo&s;iah Crane, ma&s;ter of the brigantine <HI>Two Friends,</HI> belonging to &s;ubjects of the United Netherlands, and furni&s;hed with letters of marque and repri&s;al again&s;t the &s;ubjects of the king of Great Britain. Holland had not at this time entered into any treaty with, or acknow|ledged the independence of, the United States of America. Captain Crane took out part of the crew of the Savannah, and put a prize ma&s;ter on board, and ordered her for Philadelphia; but the Su&s;annah was again captured during her voy|age
<PB N="96" REF="024407_0901_0FC72CC0C73C8230">
to Philadelphia by a Briti&s;h privateer, ta|ken to New York, and there condemned. The <HI>Two Friends</HI> arrived at Philadelphia, where Gibbs the owner of the Su&s;annah libelled again&s;t her, and again&s;t captain Crane for reparation of the lo&s;s and damage &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>IN con&s;idering this ca&s;e, two obvious points pre&s;ent, viz.</P>
<P>FIRST. Hath the brig Su&s;annah &s;o offended by her intended voyage to Turk's I&s;lands as to afford probable cau&s;e of capture and confi&s;cation?</P>
<P>SECONDLY. If not, who ought to &s;atisfy the owner for the lo&s;s of his ve&s;&s;el and cargo?</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t point the que&s;tion occurs, whether Turk's I&s;lands, may, or may not, be con&s;idered as property under the dominion of Great Britain? Whatever might have been the &s;ituation of the&s;e i&s;lands in the years 1778 and 1779, it is evident that at pre&s;ent they are abandoned by every na|tion, there having been no officer who hath exer|ci&s;ed civil or military powers there under the authority of any government whatever for at lea&s;t the&s;e two years pa&s;t. If the Briti&s;h ever had legal dominion over the&s;e i&s;lands, they have a|bandoned
<PB N="97" REF="024407_0902_0FC72CCAA9DF5088">
their right, and relea&s;ed the inhabitants from all allegiance by withdrawing all protection. So that tho&s;e people may truly be &s;aid to be in a &s;tate of nature, unle&s;s they have formed &s;ome government of their own. What offence then can ari&s;e from trading with tho&s;e i&s;lands? It is plain, from the clearances and entries in our own naval offices, that this trade hath not been deemed unlawful: and it is al&s;o in evidence, that American, French, and Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els, con|&s;tantly go to the&s;e i&s;lands for &s;alt, and no body hath heretofore que&s;tioned the legality of this commerce.</P>
<P>BUT is &s;aid, that the variance between the office clearance and an invoice found on board, marking the real de&s;tination of the voyage, affords pro|bable cau&s;e of capture, and even a &s;ufficient ground for confi&s;cation. I find, however, that it is not an unu&s;ual practice for merchants to clear out as for one legal port, but with a de&s;ign of go|ing to &s;ome other legal port, in order to conceal the real voyage, for mercantile purpo&s;es. Nor hath this practice ever been deemed an offence, or the papers found on board a ve&s;&s;el under &s;uch circum&s;tances been con&s;idered as double pape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, &s;uch as &s;hould induce a condemnation.</P>
<P><PB REF="024407_0903_0FC72CCC07181210">THE next que&s;tion is, Who ought to be an|&s;werable for the injury done? the captain, or his owners, or both?</P>
<P>THE relation between the owners and ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el hath, to many purpo&s;es, been con&s;ide|red as that of ma&s;ter and &s;ervant; and the law is clear, that the ma&s;ter is bound by whatever the &s;ervant doth by his order, under his autho|rity, or in the pro&s;ecution of his &s;ervice. See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t. Black. 429. It has been contended, however, that captain Crane was not in the pro&s;ecution of his owners &s;ervice when he made this capture, the object of the voyage being merely mercan|tile, and not to take prizes. But as this ve&s;&s;el was duly commi&s;&s;ioned to take prizes, and the owners and captain would have &s;hared the pro|duce of a legal capture, this di&s;tinction cannot be admitted, but the owners and captain mu&s;t be con&s;idered as jointly an&s;werable.</P>

<HEAD>CLINTON ver&s;us THE BRIG HANNAH AND SHIP GENERAL KNOX.</HEAD>
<P>A Plea to the juri&s;diction of the court was filed in this cau&s;e: and the que&s;tion was, Whether a <HI>Ship-Wright</HI> might &s;ue in the admiralty for his contract wages for building a &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el de&s;ign|ed for navigation on the high &s;eas?</P>
<P>AFTER long argument, the judge gave his opi|nion as follows.</P>
<P>THE authorities which the libellants have ur|ged in favour of the juri&s;diction of this court, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, are Cro. Ch. 296. and 1&s;t Rol|le 533. All the other authorities adduced having reference to tho&s;e, except one in 1 Stra. 707.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t edition of Cro. cha. page 296, we find re&s;olutions upon ca&s;es of admiralty juri&s;diction
<PB N="100" REF="024407_0905_0FC72CCF4B380A30">
&s;ub&s;cribed by all the judges of both benches, in April, 1632. Wherein, among&s;t other things, it is re&s;olved, that a &s;hip-wright may &s;ue in the admiralty, provided his &s;uit be again&s;t the &s;hip. <HI>Rolle,</HI> as a faithful abridger, gives the law as it then &s;tood under the authority of the&s;e re&s;oluti|ons. In article 19, he mentions the doctrine re|&s;pecting &s;hip-wrights, and cites the cafe of <HI>Ta&s;|ker</HI> and <HI>Gale.</HI> And in article 21, he gives the law re&s;pecting charter parties, adding the&s;e re|markable words:
<Q>As it was declared by the court to have been lately re&s;olved by all the judges of England.</Q>
So that tho&s;e re&s;olu|tions &s;eem to be the only foundation upon which the&s;e doctrines re&s;t. And it is very ob&s;ervable, that although <HI>Croke</HI> records the re&s;olutions as they were &s;ub&s;cribed in Hillary term, the eighth of Charles, yet he does not report the ca&s;e of <HI>Ta&s;ker</HI> ver&s;us <HI>Gale,</HI> although adjudged (according to <HI>Rolle</HI>) in the ninth of Charles, which mu&s;t have been but a few months after. Neither hath any other reporter of that period noticed this ca&s;e. From which it &s;eems probable, that tho&s;e re&s;olutions, and the judgment in the ca&s;e of Ta&s;|ker ver&s;us Gale, were not admitted as good law e|ven in that day.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="024407_0906_0FC72CD9623F6520">BUT it is further ob&s;ervable, that when <HI>Sir Harbottle Grime&s;tone</HI> publi&s;hed Croke's reports in the year 1657, he prefixed, even to this fir&s;t e|dition, a declaration under the title <HI>Manti&s;&s;a,</HI> that the re&s;olutions of the judges in Feb. 1632, were not of authority: and for this rea&s;on (ac|cording to Comyns) tho&s;e re&s;olutions were totally omitted in the &s;ub&s;equent editions of that work. Since that time no in&s;tance can be found in the books, where either the&s;e re&s;olutions, or the ca&s;e of Ta&s;ker ver&s;us Gale adjudged thereupon, have been referred to either by the court, or in the pleadings in any adjudged ca&s;e, except in the ca&s;e of Wooward ver&s;us Bonithan, Sir. T. Raymond. p. 3: and there the court declared, that tho&s;e re&s;olutions had been denied by &s;everal judges, and renounced by even &s;ome of tho&s;e who had &s;ub&s;cribed them. And of this, <HI>Danvers</HI> al&s;o takes particular notice, p. 271. Therefore the autho|rity of the&s;e re&s;olutions &s;eems to have been aboli&s;h|ed by general con&s;ent.</P>
<P>BUT another ca&s;e has been referred to as au|thority in point, viz. 1&s;t Stra. 707. The report is very &s;hort, and in the&s;e words:
<Q>On a motion for a prohibition, it was held, that a <HI>carpenter</HI> may &s;ue for wages in the admiralty.</Q>
This report, however, is too &s;light and &s;olitary to au|thori&s;e
<PB N="102" REF="024407_0907_0FC72CDC021B4A98">
a deci&s;ion contrary to general e&s;tabli&s;hed rules. The word <HI>carpenter</HI> doth not preci&s;ely in|dicate a &s;hip-wright, but may be applicable to a mariner on board a ve&s;&s;el; and as the ca&s;es refer|red to in the margin of this report, re&s;pecting the officers of a &s;hip who &s;ued in the admiralty as ma|riners, the probability is, that this al&s;o was an officer called the <HI>&s;hip's-carpenter</HI>: A doubt having ari&s;en whether the &s;ubordinate officers of a &s;hip, as well as the ma&s;ter, were not prohibited from &s;uing in the admiralty for wages.</P>
<P>IF the re&s;olutions of the judges in 1632, and the deci&s;ion in the ca&s;e of Ta&s;ker ver&s;us Gale, were admitted as law, and if the carpenter men|tioned in 1&s;t Stra. 707, was the &s;hip-wright or builder, how is it po&s;&s;ible that the judges &s;o lately as the 1765, &s;hould declare in court, that no in&s;tance could be found where both the contract and &s;ervice were to be done on land, within the body of a country, that the common law courts ever permitted the admiralty to have juri&s;diction? I refer to 2d <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> p. 265: and this opinion was given in the ca&s;e of a pilot &s;uing for &s;ervices done, indeed within the body of a county, but in a ca&s;e of a much &s;tronger maritime com|plexion than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="024407_0908_0FC72CE477BB3E10">THERE are &s;everal exceptions to the general rules of law re&s;pecting admiralty juri&s;diction, as a&s;certained by the &s;tatutes: &s;uch as &s;uits for mari|ners wages, and on hypothecations made by the ma&s;ter in foreign parts, &amp;c. &amp;c. which have been &s;o often conte&s;ted, and &s;o often allowed, for good and weighty rea&s;ons, that they have become con|firmed law, and it would be in vain now to oppo&s;e the general rule to the general practice. But this does not appear to the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to &s;hip-wrights; neither are the &s;ame rea&s;ons appli|capable to them.

The facts were now more &s;trictly &s;crutinized, and new te&s;timony adduced, among&s;t which the re&s;pondent pre&s;ented the depo&s;ition of Silas Fo&s;ter, one of the Holker's crew: but it was objected, that Fo&s;ter was an intere&s;ted wit|ne&s;s, and that his te&s;timony ought not to be ad|mitted. After full argument thereupon, the judge decided this point, as follows:</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion under con&s;ideration, re&s;pects the competency of a witne&s;s produced by the re&s;pon|dent in this cau&s;e. On the one &s;ide, a general principle of law hath been urged, viz. that a per|&s;on intere&s;ted in the event of a cau&s;e, &s;hall not be allowed to give te&s;timony in that cau&s;e: and, on the other, an exception to this general rule, viz. that if no further or better evidence can be had, an intere&s;ted party may and ought to be heard, from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, his intere&s;t only affecting his credibility, not his competency. And the danger of an unhappy precedent in the rejec|tion or admi&s;&s;ion of the witne&s;s now offered, hath been &s;ufficiently enlarged upon on both &s;ides. But

I cannot &s;ee the danger apprehended, &s;ince the determination in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, can be no rule for any other, unle&s;s the circum&s;tances of both &s;hould be preci&s;ely &s;imilar; becau&s;e, the court will always take into con&s;ideration the degree and na|ture of the intere&s;t, that &s;hould exclude a witne&s;s under the general rule, and the reality of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity to admit him under the exception, and al&s;o judge of the credibility, according to circum&s;tan|ces. To this purpo&s;e I refer to laws of <HI>ni&s;i prius,</HI> p. 286.
<Q>Scroggs, ch. ju&s;. &s;aid, that it ought not to be a general rule, that members of corpo|rations &s;hall be admitted or denied to be witne&s;&s;es, in ca&s;es for or again&s;t their corporations: but every ca&s;e &s;tands upon its own particular cir|cum&s;tances, viz. whether the intere&s;t be &s;o con|&s;iderable as by pre&s;umption to produce partiali|ty or not.

<P>THE &s;hip Lady Margaret, was, by a decree of this court, condemned as prize to the captors. The mar&s;hal, after making &s;ale of the property, adverti&s;ed as u&s;ual for all per&s;ons who had any claim thereupon, to appear in per&s;on, or by agent, and receive their re&s;pective &s;hares. <HI>Fo&s;ter's</HI> agent accordingly appeared, and received his &s;hare, which was afterwards paid over to him, as appears by his receipt to the &s;aid agent. The pre&s;ent li|bellants i&s;&s;ued no prohibition to the mar&s;hal, to &s;tay his proceedings, nor intimated any de&s;ign of claiming &s;hares in this prize. The mar&s;hal, there|fore, went on and completed his bu&s;ine&s;s, with re&s;pect to this ve&s;&s;el and her cargo, and filed his accounts and returns, dated Feb. 1781, in the re|gi&s;ter's office; by which accounts it appears, that full di&s;tribution had been made. The pre&s;ent li|bellants having recovered in the ca&s;e of the brig Gloce&s;ter, a prize taken by the &s;ame privateer, and in the &s;ame crui&s;e in which the Lady Margaret was captured, now claim &s;hares in the Lady Mar|garet al&s;o, upon the principles of the former deci|&s;ion in their favour. The captain of the privateer
<PB N="110" REF="024407_0915_0FC72D020259F590">
hath filed his an&s;wer in oppo&s;ition to this claim, and offers <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> as witne&s;s in his behalf: but it is alledged that <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> may have an intere&s;t in the event of this cau&s;e, upon a &s;ugge&s;tion, that al|though the mar&s;hal hath in his returns, fully ba|lanced his accounts re&s;pecting the Lady Margaret, yet he hath done it wrongfully, by charging ex|travagant and illegal commi&s;&s;ions, as appears upon the very face of his returns. So that there is in fact a part of that prize yet in his hands, a di&s;tribu|tive &s;hare of which <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> will be entitled to, if the libellants &s;hould fail in their &s;uit, he being one of the captors of that prize.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems then, that <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI>'s intere&s;t depends upon two contingencies &mdash;Fir&s;t, that the libellants &s;hall fail in their pre&s;ent claim: and, &s;econdly, that the mar&s;hal &s;hall not be able to ju&s;tify the com|mi&s;&s;ions he hath charged.</P>
<P>IF this intere&s;t depended upon the fir&s;t contin|gency only, it might be deemed too clo&s;ely con|nected with the event of this cau&s;e, to admit him as a witne&s;s of full credibility: but when the na|ture of the &s;econd contingency is con&s;idered, viz. that it is now full two years &s;ince the mar&s;hal made his returns, and that neither Fo&s;ter, nor any of the concerned, have objected to the commi&s;&s;ions charg|ed,
<PB N="111" REF="024407_0916_0FC72D02C916B0D0">
or manife&s;ted any expectations of receiving fur|ther advantages from the Lady Margaret, his in|tere&s;t, if any, &s;eems to be &s;o very remote, as not to <HI>found any rea&s;onable pre&s;umption that it will produce partiality, or to carry a &s;trong danger of perjury.</HI></P>
<P>THE u&s;e of te&s;timony, is to a&s;certain truth, that ju&s;tice may be admini&s;tered. Therefore, witne&s;&s;es ought not to be rejected on &s;light grounds of di&s;a|bility, or on mere &s;ugge&s;tion of a di&s;tant intere&s;t, e&s;pecially in maritime &s;uits, where from the &s;cene of tran&s;action, a totally di&s;intere&s;ted te&s;timony can &s;eldom be procured.

<HEAD>JUDGMENT ON THE MERITS.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to determine this cau&s;e to my own &s;a|tisfaction, I find i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate and con&s;ider three points, which will, I apprehend, include all the principles that can affect this controver&s;y.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> que&s;tion is, Whether tho&s;e who &s;ign-the <HI>Holker's</HI> articles, after notice given that her
<PB N="112" REF="024407_0917_0FC72D0444DAA530">
compliment of men was full, and that no more could be received on board, and who did not go the crui&s;e, although their not going &s;hould be oc|ca&s;ioned by a forcible rejection, ought to draw &s;hares of all, or any of the prizes taken in that crui&s;e?</P>
<P>It appears by the depo&s;ition of Henry Martin, the keeper of the hou&s;e of rendezvous, that al|though Fletcher, one of the Holker's officers, in|formed many who applied that they could not be admitted, becau&s;e the privateer's compliment of men was complete, and that they would be turn|ed on &s;hore if they came on board, yet they per|&s;i&s;ted to &s;ign the articles, and even took the ad|vantage of the officer's turning his back to &s;ign tho&s;e articles without his knowledge, &s;aying, they would run their chance. If any of the libellants &s;hould be found in this predicament, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to di&s;mi&s;s their claim. Becau&s;e no man ought to have an engagement forced upon him: mutual con&s;ent, expre&s;&s;ed or implied, being ne|ce&s;&s;ary to every contract.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> que&s;tion is, Whether tho&s;e who re|gularly &s;igned the articles, or were duly enli&s;ted by parole-agreement before the ve&s;&s;el's crew was complete, and again&s;t whom no breach of duty is

<P>THE <HI>third</HI> que&s;tion is, Whether parties under the circum&s;tances la&s;t mentioned, being pre&s;ent, and &s;uffering the mar&s;hal to &s;ell and di&s;tribute af|ter public notice given, any prize or prizes in which they might have claimed an intere&s;t, with|out filing their claim, or giving any notice to the mar&s;hal that they intend &s;o to do, ought not to be deemed &s;uch a wilful neglect, either again&s;t the mar&s;hal, for not having re&s;erved their &s;hares, or again&s;t the captain, for omitting their names in the return of his crew?</P>
<P>IN clearing up this point, it may be allowed, that &s;o long as property remains in the mar&s;hal's hands, &s;ubject to the di&s;po&s;al of the court, no length of time &s;hould bar a legal claimant from recovering his right.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="024407_0919_0FC72D0E68066A08">THE practice is, for the mar&s;hal, after he has made &s;ale of a prize, to adverti&s;e in the pub|lic papers for all per&s;ons having any claim there|in, to appear by a certain day and receive their di&s;tributive &s;hares. If, after that day, he &s;hould find any per&s;on's names in the li&s;t of the crew han|ded to him who have not appeared in per&s;on, or by agent, he makes report thereof to the judge, who, by virtue of a law of this &s;tate, will appoint an agent for &s;uch ab&s;ent per&s;ons. After which di&s;tribution is made and the accounts clo&s;ed, and lodged in the regi&s;ter's office.</P>
<P>NOW, if any &s;hould think them&s;elves injured by the return of the crew, ina&s;much as their names have been omitted, and yet &s;hall &s;tand by and &s;ee the whole of the property di&s;tributed, without applying to the court or mar&s;hal for their &s;hares, or giving any legal notice of their intention to make &s;uch a claim, it &s;eems to be a rea&s;onable con|clu&s;ion that they have voluntarily abandoned their right. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it is remarkable, that the&s;e very libellants brought their &s;uit two years ago for &s;hares in the Gloce&s;ter, and recovered, and yet from that time to the pre&s;ent they in&s;tituted no claim for &s;hares in the Lady Margaret, although this prize was, with re&s;pect to them, in the &s;ame predicament with the Gloce&s;ter.</P>

<P>THE libellants entered on board the <HI>Nancy</HI> in January, 1783, and &s;igned articles, acccording to cu&s;tom, for a certain voyage to L'Orient, and back again to the port of Philadelphia. <HI>Brice</HI> en|gaged to &s;erve in the capacity of fir&s;t lieutenant, and <HI>Woodroff,</HI> as &s;urgeon, to the &s;hip, which was an armed letter of marque. By the&s;e articles Brice was to receive &pound;. 18 and Woodroff &pound; 17. per month. At this time it was war between Great Britain and the United States of America. The &s;hip fell down the river in order to commence her voyage, but from various cau&s;es of delay, did not clear the Capes, &s;o as to enter on the high &s;eas, before the 20th of March following. In the mean time, viz. on the 3d of March, peace had taken place, and ho&s;tilities cea&s;ed between the bel|ligerent powers.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON, it has been alledged in behalf of the re&s;pondents, that &pound;. 5 per month are the
<PB N="119" REF="024407_0924_0FC72D22C710DA68">
cu&s;tomary wages in time of peace, and a full re|compence for &s;ervices for navigating a &s;hip; that all above that &s;um is allowed in con&s;ideration of the ri&s;k and dangers of war. That the con&s;i|deration failing, and no ri&s;k being incurred, as peace had taken place before the &s;hip had entered on the field of danger, the extraordinary wages ought to abate, and that the libellants ought to be content with peace wages for &s;ervices done in time of peace.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, it has been urged, that the contract was duly and regularly made: that con|tracts are &s;acred things, and ought to be taken entire, and &s;trictly con&s;trued: that contracting par|ties &s;hould not be admitted to explain their in|tentions afterwards, or recede from the terms, of their bargain, on account of future contingen|cies, provided there was no fraud in the ca&s;e: that the performance of the voyage, and doing the duty on board, are the true con&s;ideration of the wages: that whether the&s;e wages are high or low is a matter that &s;hould have been con&s;idered when the contract was made: that as it cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed, that if the danger had been greatly encrea|&s;ed by the arrival from an enemy's fleet on the coa&s;t, or from any other circum&s;tance, the owners would have allowed encrea&s;ed wages, neither

ought they to dimini&s;h the wages, becau&s;e the danger happened to be le&s;&s;ened by the interven|tion of peace. And la&s;tly, that the voyage was actually commenced when the &s;hip left the port, although &s;he remained long after in the river.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE advanced wages above what is cu&s;tomary in time of peace is in con&s;ideration of the ri&s;k and dangers incident to war: in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it is clear that both parties, when they made the contract, had war in view, as is evident from the &s;tations the libel|lants were to fill, viz. the one, that of fir&s;t lieutenant, and the other, that of &s;urgeon of the &s;hip, offices unknown on board of merchantmen in time of peace. Whether it would indeed be peace or war, was a circum&s;tance out of the reach of the parties to command. Peace, however, did take place, &s;eventeen days before any ri&s;k whatever was incurred on account of the war.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of in&s;urance cited from 3d Burrow's, p. 1237, is a leading ca&s;e in point. The contract there was regularly made between parties, more competent to be &s;trictly bound than common mariners, viz. the owners of a &s;hip and the un|der
<PB N="121" REF="024407_0926_0FC72D278A697760">
writers, and yet it was determimed by all the judges, that this contract ought to be liberally con&s;trued; and that the in&s;urance premium &s;hould be returned for &s;uch part of the voyage as had ran no ri&s;k.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e lately decided in this court, M'Cul|loch ver&s;us Lethe, has been quoted; but there is a manife&s;t and e&s;&s;ential difference between that ca&s;e and the pre&s;ent. In the former, the libellant had actually incurred the ri&s;k, had &s;ubjected him|&s;elf to be killed in battle, or taken pri&s;oner, which was the real con&s;ideration of the war wages pro|mi&s;ed; in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e no ri&s;k from war was at all incurred: for, although much pains hath been taken to &s;hew, that the captain and crew of the Nancy, not having heard of the peace, had &s;uf|ficient rea&s;on to think that it was war when they &s;ailed, and conducted them&s;elves accordingly; yet the que&s;tion is not, what might have been their apprehen&s;ions, but what was the reality of the danger, or whether it was indeed war or peace at the time?</P>
<P>HAD this ve&s;&s;el advanced into the &s;cene of dan|ger, though but for twenty-four hours before peace had taken effect, I &s;hould have no doubt in allowing the libellants their full wages, accor|ding
<PB N="122" REF="024407_0927_0FC72D2904D9AB30">
to the articles, upon the &s;ame principles on which wages were decreed to M'Culloch.</P>
<P>THAT the common law doctrines re&s;pecting con|tracts do not apply in all their &s;trictne&s;s to ca&s;es ma|ritime is evident from the con&s;tant practice of this court. The enli&s;tment of mariners have neither the complexion nor the formalities required by the rules of common law; and it would be hard to bind men &s;o ignorant as common mariners generally are, to the legal con&s;truction of terms, nor would it be for the intere&s;t of mariners, that articles &s;hould be &s;o &s;trictly con&s;trued, as the operation would probably be frequently much again&s;t them.</P>
<P>IT appears, that when the libellants entered on board the Nancy, it was actual war, and that they held them&s;elves in readine&s;s to do the &s;ervices, and encounter the dangers for which the &s;tipula|ted wages had been promi&s;ed. It was not their fault that the ve&s;&s;el did not forthwith proceed on her voyage. I &s;ee therefore no rea&s;on again&s;t their being allowed full wages for that period, and the common u&s;age is to allow mariners their wages from the time of &s;igning the articles, let the ve&s;&s;el &s;ail when &s;he may.</P>
<P>I adjudge that the libellants have and receive
<PB N="123" REF="024407_0928_0FC72D33F3EE24C8">
their full wages, according to contract, from the time of &s;igning the articles, to the 3d of March la&s;t; and that they receive cu&s;tomary peace-wages from the &s;aid 3d of March, to the completion of the voyage.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SHAW</HI> ver&s;us <HI>THE LETHE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOMAS Shaw, the libellant, entered on board the &s;hip <HI>Lethe,</HI> as &s;urgeon, and contracted to &s;erve in that capacity from Philadelphia to Bourdeaux, and back again, for the wages of &pound;. 15 per month. It was then war, and &s;o continued till the ve&s;&s;el arrived at Bourdeaux: whil&s;t &s;he was there in port peace took place. The libellant continued on board, and returned with the ve&s;&s;el to Philadel|phia, and now demands the &s;tipulated wages of &pound;. 15 per month, notwith&s;tanding the peace.</P>
<P>MUCH has been &s;aid re&s;pecting the entirety of contracts on the one hand, and the divi&s;ibility
<PB N="124" REF="024407_0929_0FC72D35D1510F48">
of contracts, particularly tho&s;e of in&s;urance and mercantile agreements, on the other.</P>
<P>IT has been urged for the libellant, that the voyage to Bourdeaux and back again, mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as one entire voyage; and that if this ve&s;&s;el had been in&s;ured, or chartered, there could have been no apportionment of the premium or hire on account of the peace.</P>
<P>AGAINST this doctrine, the ca&s;e of <HI>Stephen&s;on</HI> ver&s;us <HI>Snow,</HI> 3d Bur. 1237, has been cited, and ful|ly con&s;idered. The ca&s;e was&mdash;a &s;hip was in&s;ured for a certain premium, to &s;ail from London to Halifax; the in&s;ured warranting that &s;he &s;hould &s;ail with convoy from Port&s;mouth. She arrived at Port&s;|mouth, but the convoy was gone. Whereupon a return of premium was demanded, deducting only the cu&s;tomary in&s;urance from London to Port&s;mouth. The entirety of contracts was here urged again&s;t the in&s;urers, but over-ruled by the whole court, who con&s;idered the contract as divi&s;i|ble, and having reference to two di&s;tinct voyages, viz. from London to Port&s;mouth, and from thence to Halifax; and determined that as the ri&s;k of the &s;econd voyage had never been begun, the premi|um for that had never inured.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="024407_0930_0FC72D37744783B0">THIS ca&s;e appeared at fir&s;t view to apply clo&s;e|ly to the pre&s;ent; but, on a nearer in&s;pection, I find that the warrantee to &s;ail with convoy was the ground of that deci&s;ion. It was that alone which rendered the voyage divi&s;ible, becau&s;e it was of the e&s;&s;ence of the contract. Had the &s;hip &s;ailed without, and been lo&s;t, the in&s;urers would not have been an&s;werable. Had &s;he been in&s;ured from London to Halifax, without any condition annexed, and had &s;topped in her way at Port&s;|mouth, and proceeded no further, the voyage would not, I apprehend, have been deemed divi|&s;ible on that account, nor the premium appor|tioned; &s;o that the warrantee to &s;ail with convey was the foundation of the contract, which fai|ling, the contract failed, &s;o far as the &s;ame had re&s;pect thereto. The voyage from London to Port&s;mouth &s;eems to be no more than a nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;&s;age to the place where the &s;ub&s;tantial part of the contract was to take effect; where the premi|um was to be earned by the commencement of the ri&s;k under the condition &s;pecified.</P>
<P>BUT I find nothing parallel with this in the ar|ticles of the &s;hip Lethe: no contingency mention|ed; but only a &s;imple contract for a voyage to Bour|deaux and back again, in con&s;ideration of certain
<PB N="126" REF="024407_0931_0FC72D42846D3D60">
&s;ervices to be performed on the one part, and cer|tain wages to be paid on the other. If there is any &s;imilarity in the two ca&s;es, it con&s;i&s;ts in this: that, as in the one, the &s;ailing with convoy was the ground of the <HI>quantum</HI> of the premium; &s;o in the other, the war was the ground of the <HI>quantum</HI> of wages. In the ca&s;e referred to, the contingen|cy was fully recognized in the contract: the &s;hip was warranted to &s;ail with convoy, but no con|tingencies are provided for in the Lethe's articles. If the in&s;ured ve&s;&s;el had &s;ailed with the convoy, though but for one day, and returned, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that any part of the premium would have been re&s;tored.</P>
<P>THAT the mere arrival of a ve&s;&s;el at a port or ports cannot be con&s;trued as a divi&s;ion of the voy|age delineated by the articles, is manife&s;t from a current of law and practice: &s;o it was determined in the ca&s;e of Bernon <HI>ver&s;us</HI> Woodbridge, Douglas, 753, and numberle&s;s charter parties, in&s;urances, and articles for mariner's wages have reference to circuitous voyages. Nor was it under&s;tood, that a fortuitous increa&s;e or diminution of the ri&s;k, or any alteration of circum&s;tances between one port of de&s;tination and another, would affect the con|tract, unle&s;s provided for by the terms of the agreement.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="024407_0932_0FC72D47DB883F90">BUT it hath been &s;trongly urged, that the high wages promi&s;ed, and the nature of the &s;ervice to be performed, have reference to war only; and that as peace took place whil&s;t the ve&s;&s;el was &s;afe in port, the voyage, from the manife&s;t object of the contract, became divi&s;ible: and that it would be very hard to bind the ma&s;ter or owners to the mo&s;t &s;evere con&s;truction of the articles, and make them pay for &s;ervices, which, from an unfore&s;een change of affairs, were rendered im|practicable.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there is an equitable force in this argument, yet, under the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, there &s;eems to have been an obvious duty on the part of the ma&s;ter to have entitled him to an equitable relief from the binding force of the arti|cles. He &s;hould have propo&s;ed to pay off the crew at Bourdeaux, and tendered a new contract on peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, prote&s;ting again&s;t the for|mer articles. Nor is this a mere ceremony, but what &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice &s;eems to require. The mariners, under the articles, could not leave the &s;hip without incurring a penalty. If then they are detained on board without any explanation, not|with&s;tanding the great change of circum&s;tances, they had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to conclude, that they were continued in the &s;ervice upon the terms of
<PB N="128" REF="024407_0933_0FC72D494E41D378">
the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting contract: and this rea&s;oning will well apply if the ca&s;e be rever&s;ed. Suppo&s;e the mari|ner had engaged in time of peace, and war had broke out during the voyage, and he had made no declaration that he was di&s;&s;atisfied with the terms of his contract, or expected war wages in con&s;i|deration of the ri&s;k he was to run, I believe there are few ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els who would not urge his &s;ilence as an acquie&s;cence in the continuation of the contract, and bind him down to the terms of the original contract.</P>
<P>IT is &s;o natural to expect &s;ome declaration of the will of contracting parties, when circum&s;tances out of the reach of either have occurred, which totally alters the principles upon which the con|tract was formed, that an omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch decla|ration can have no other interpretation, but that of wilful neglect or deep de&s;ign, neither of which is the law di&s;po&s;ed to countenance. Hence, pro|bably, aro&s;e the cu&s;tom of prote&s;ts, in ca&s;es of wreck, illegal capture, fire, and other unfore&s;een and unavoidable accidents.</P>
<P>ONE other argument hath been urged for the re&s;pondents, viz. that freight is the mother of wa|ges; inferring, that as this ve&s;&s;el received only
<PB N="129" REF="024407_0934_0FC72D4B04955AE8">
peace freight from Bourdeaux to Philadelphia, no more than peace wages ought to be allowed for that part of the voyage.</P>
<P>IT does not appear in te&s;timony what freight this ve&s;&s;el received: but if it did, I &s;ee no force in the argument. There is, in fact, no connexion be|tween freight and the quantum of wages; nor are the mariners ever privy to the terms on which a cargo hath been &s;hipped. It is only a law of po|licy which arbitrarily makes the payment (not the rate per month) of the wages to depend on the &s;afe conduct of the cargo, in order to induce the mariners to exert them&s;elves in ca&s;e of wreck, to &s;ave as much as po&s;&s;ible, knowing, that if the whole be lo&s;t, they mu&s;t lo&s;e the whole of their wages. If the freight is thus called the mother, the &s;ervice performed may well be deemed the father, of the mariner's wages, that being the real and legal con|&s;ideration. There is no doubt but the mariner &s;hall have his wages, in ca&s;es where no freight at all is received; as in ve&s;&s;els &s;ailing with balla&s;t on|ly, which often happens. The truth is, the mari|ner's lien is on the &s;hip, and not on the cargo. Nor, was it ever known, that freight could be attached in the merchant's hands to an&s;wer for mariner's
<PB N="130" REF="024407_0935_0FC72D53544AA420">
wages, but the &s;hip is liable uoder all circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>I have not noticed the &s;hip's going to Teneriffe from Bourdeaux before &s;he came to Philadelphia, as this circum&s;tance, if it has any operation at all, mu&s;t be again&s;t the ma&s;ter, who ought not to bene|fit by his own deviation from the articles.</P>
<P>AFTER mature con&s;ideration, I cannot find &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on to give a different deci&s;ion now, from what was lately given in the ca&s;e of M'Culloch, again&s;t the &s;ame &s;hip. The continuation of the libellant on board, after it was known that peace had taken place, without any declaration of the ma&s;ter, that he expected the terms of the contract &s;hould be changed, is too &s;trong a circum&s;tance to be got over.</P>

After an engagement of two hours, Talbot captured the Bet&s;ey; put one We&s;t on board, as prize ma&s;ter, together with eleven of his crew, with written orders to the prize ma&s;ter to take her into the port of New London, then not far di&s;tant, for condemnation.</P>
<P>THE next day after the capture, the three brigs, Achilles, Patty, and Hibernia, belonging to the re&s;pondents in this cau&s;e, came up with the Bet&s;ey,
<PB N="133" REF="024407_0938_0FC72D5AA3343500">
under Briti&s;h colours. Captain Talbot taking them for enemies, was obliged to leave his prize, and fly: whereupon one of the three brigs cha&s;ed the Argo, whil&s;t the Patty fired upon, boarded, and captured the Bet&s;ey.</P>
<P>WEST, the prize ma&s;ter, finding them to be Americans, declared that the Bet&s;ey was a prize of captain Talbot, in the Argo, then in &s;ight, and &s;hewed Talbot's written orders to him: but for fear of their claiming &s;hares of the prize, as hav|ing been in &s;ight when &s;he was captured, a&s;&s;erted, that &s;he had been taken three days before. The per&s;ons who boarded the Bet&s;ey having &s;een a bat|tle the day before, between a brig and a &s;loop, which they believed to be the &s;ame; and ob&s;erv|ing that the number of men on board, corre&s;pond|ed with the number regi&s;tered in her Briti&s;h pa|pers, concluded that no credit &s;hould be given to We&s;t's declaration. Whereupon, a con&s;ultation was held by the three captains,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to W&mdash; D&mdash;'s depo&s;ition.</NOTE> who finally made prize of the Bet&s;ey, took out all the Argo's men, except one negro, and putting their own people on board, ordered her for Philadelphia. But &s;he was &s;oon after captured by a Briti&s;h crui&s;er,
<PB N="134" REF="024407_0939_0FC72D6292777290">
and carried into New York&mdash;and &s;o lo&s;t to all parties. The three brigs pur&s;ued their re&s;pective voyages; taking the Argo's men with them, whom they left in Spain, and other remote parts.</P>
<P>THE re&s;pondents have re&s;ted their defence on two grounds of argument: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> they alledge, that they have produced &s;ufficient te&s;timony to prove that the brigs Achilles, Patty, and Hiber|nia, were within &s;ight, when the Argo engaged and captured the Bet&s;ey, and acquired thereby a property in the prize, according to the maritime law: inferring, that as their intere&s;t in the booty was much greater than that of the Argo, they be|ing three to one, they had a right to order the prize where they judged be&s;t for their &s;ecurity and benefit; more e&s;pecially as they had rea&s;on to doubt the fidelity of We&s;t, in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion they found her, on account of the fal&s;hood he had told them: concluding, that if any injury was done to the libellant, it only amounted to his pro|portionable &s;hare of the booty, for which alone they ought to be an&s;werable. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that ma|ny &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances on board the Bet&s;ey&mdash; &s;uch as the Briti&s;h papers, the number of men on board agreeing therewith, and the declaration of We&s;t, that &s;he had been captured three days be|fore,
<PB N="135" REF="024407_0940_0FC72D670D1BA2F8">
contrary to their own ob&s;ervation, were &s;uffi|cient to induce them to conclude that the whole was an artifice; and, therefore, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were ju&s;tifia|ble in taking her as original prize, and to con&s;ider them&s;elves as the fir&s;t captors.</P>
<P>THESE two po&s;itions of defence are &s;upported by the te&s;timony of W&mdash; D&mdash;, a pa&s;&s;enger on board the Patty. This depo&s;ition, on which alone the re&s;pondents have relied, labours for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of two facts which are altogether incompatible with each other, viz. fir&s;t, that the three brigs &s;aw the Argo engage and capture the Bet&s;y; and, &s;econdly, that the Bet&s;y had not been captured at all, or, at lea&s;t, that the captains of the three brigs had good rea&s;on to think &s;o, and were ju&s;tifiable in taking her as ori|ginal prize. One only of the&s;e po&s;itions can be true: therefore, a te&s;timony which labours to e&s;tabli&s;h both, may, at lea&s;t, be &s;aid to prove too much.</P>
<P>THE fact be&s;t &s;upported by the circum&s;tances &s;eems to be, that the three brigs were in &s;ight of the battle between the Argo and Bet&s;y. What then was their conduct in this point of view? The next day after the engagement, of which
<PB N="136" REF="024407_0941_0FC72D6804A57400">
they had been di&s;tant &s;pectators, they come up under Briti&s;h colours; they find the Bet&s;y in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and under the protection of the Ar|go, her captor; they cha&s;e away the Argo, and fire on the prize under Briti&s;h colours; they board her; take out all the people placed on board by captain Talbot; man her with part of their own crews; give her in charge to their own prize-ma&s;ter, and order her for Philadelphia. Could their having been in &s;ight, the day before, of the engagement between the Argo and the Bet|&s;y, ju&s;tify &s;uch a procedure? Surely it could not. Be&s;ides, it is manife&s;t, that the rule of law re&s;pect|ing ve&s;&s;els in &s;ight of a capture does not refer to what may have been &s;een by the claimants, but by people on board the prize: for the rule is founded on a pre&s;umption, that the crew of the captured ve&s;&s;el, &s;eeing others coming up armed and prepared for battle, were thereby induced to &s;urrender.</P>
<P>FURTHER, I can on no account admit the doc|trine, now for the fir&s;t time advanced, and un&s;up|ported by any authority whatever, that captains, claiming a &s;hare in the prize they may have &s;een captured, have a right to order the booty where they plea&s;e, by virtue of a majority of votes, or
<PB N="137" REF="024407_0942_0FC72D6986D5AA10">
of their &s;uperior intere&s;t in the captured property. Their claim mu&s;t follow, and depend upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the real captor. Be&s;ides, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the libellant who fought for, and alone took the brig Bet&s;ey, had at lea&s;t &s;ome right in the prize: the captains of the three brigs the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efore, ought in ju&s;tice, to have left his prize-ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er on board to pro&s;ecute the Argo's claim, which was not done.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, this &s;eems to have been an act of &s;uch unju&s;tifiable violence and wrong, on the part of the brigs Achilles, Patty, and H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bernia, that I am clear in deciding in favour of the libel|lant in this cau&s;e. And, having carefully a&s;certain|ed the value of the property lo&s;t, I find that a brig of 200 tuns, mounting eight &s;ix-pounders, with her tackel, apparel, furniture, and prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ions on board, was, in October 1779, worth

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Judgment on a Plea to the Juri&s;diction of the Admiralty.</HEAD>
<P>IN a former &s;uit in this court, <HI>Silas Tabot</HI> libel|led and recovered again&s;t Deans, Purviance, and Harbe&s;on, as owners of the brigantine Hibernia, and al&s;o again&s;t certain other per&s;ons, re&s;pondents in that cau&s;e, for a wrongful capture on the high &s;eas. From the decree in that cau&s;e, an appeal was made to the high court of errors and appeals for this commonwealth, where a judgement was finally obtained again&s;t the &s;aid re&s;pondents, to a con&s;iderable amount. And now, Dean Purvi|ance, and Harbe&s;on, owners of the Hibernia libel again&s;t John Angus, their captain, for &s;atisfaction of the damages they have &s;u&s;tained, in con&s;e|quence of the wrongful capture he had made.</P>

<P><PB N="141" REF="024407_0946_0FC72D7E4A717E10">TO one or other of the&s;e principles mu&s;t the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e apply: to a&s;certain the juri&s;diction by which it is to be tried, and the propriety of the application depends upon this &s;ole que&s;tion, What is the original cau&s;e of action in this &s;uit?</P>
<P>IT is alledged in &s;upport of the plea, that this is a <HI>new</HI> action between the owners of a ve&s;&s;el and their captain, and hath no nece&s;&s;ary connexion with the &s;uit brought by Silas Talbot: that it is enough, if the re&s;pondent &s;hews that the decree pa&s;t again&s;t the libellants, not as principals in the wrongful capture, but &s;olely on account of the maritime law, which makes owners an&s;werable for the mi&s;|conduct of the captains they employ; and there|fore their connexion with Angus, as captain of the Hibernia, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the true cau&s;e of the damage they &s;ay they have &s;u&s;tain|ed, and the &s;ource from which the pre&s;ent &s;uit originates. And &s;o infer, that as this connexion is grounded on a contract expre&s;s or implied, made upon land, the original cau&s;e of action mu&s;t, from its nature and locality, be <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> of common law juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>THE two criterions of exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction are, the <HI>&s;ubject matter,</HI> and the <HI>locality</HI> of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="024407_0947_0FC72D801AE19B68">IT is not doubted, but that the que&s;tion, <HI>prize or no prize?</HI> when it is the foundation of a &s;uit, is <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> of admiralty cognizance from the <HI>&s;ubject matter.</HI> The authorities to this point are too pre|ci&s;e to admit of doubt. But &s;ome of the&s;e autho|rities go further; and &s;ay, that the mere taking <HI>as prize,</HI> and all matters dependant thereupon, are al&s;o peculiarly of admiralty juri&s;diction. Ld. Ch. Jus. Lee's opinion, in the ca&s;e of Rous ver&s;us Ha&s;|&s;ard, as cited by Lord Mansfield, and again cited by ju&s;tice Willis, in the ca&s;e of Le. Caux ver&s;us Eden. Dougla&s;s, 581, is full to this purpo&s;e.
<Q>The great que&s;tion was, Whether an action for tre&s;pa&s;s would lie for taking a &s;hip as a prize? Lord chief ju&s;tice <HI>Lee,</HI> having called in two civilians to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, delivered the opinion of the court. That though, for taking a &s;hip on the &s;eas, tre&s;&s;pa&s;s would lie at common law, yet when it was taken <HI>as prize,</HI> though ta|ken wrongfully, though it were acquitted, and though <HI>there was no colour for</HI> the taking, the judge of the admiralty was judge of the dama|ges and co&s;ts, as well as of the principal mat|ter: and he laid it down as law, that, if &s;uch an action was brought in England, and the defen|dant <HI>not guilty,</HI> the plaintiff could not recover.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="024407_0948_0FC72D81912BA528">IT is clear by this authority, that in order to fix the admiralty juri&s;diction, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that the que&s;tion before the court &s;hould preci&s;e|ly be, <HI>prize or no prize?</HI> but that a &s;uit for co&s;ts and damages may and mu&s;t be brought in the ad|miralty for a taking <HI>as prize,</HI> though wrongfully done, and even without any colour for &s;uch ta|king, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem from the ca&s;e, even though the property &s;o taken &s;hould not be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the court.</P>
<P>SO al&s;o, in the ca&s;e of Lindo ver&s;us <HI>Rodney</HI> and <HI>Vaughan</HI> (Dougla&s;s, 592.) Lord Mansfield, in giving the opinion of the court, &s;ays:
<Q>A thing being done upon the high &s;eas, does not exclude the juri&s;diction of the common law; for &s;eizing, &s;topping, or taking a &s;hip upon the high &s;eas, <HI>not as prize,</HI> an action will lie, but for taking <HI>as prize,</HI> no action will lie. The nature of the que&s;tion excludes not the locality.</Q>
And a little further on&mdash;
<Q>The end of prize-court is to &s;u&s;pend the property till condemnation, <HI>and to puni&s;h every &s;ort of mi&s;behaviour in the cap|tors.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HOW it came to pa&s;s that the ca&s;e of Silas Tal|bot was, by the court of errors and appeals, and &s;till is, by conce&s;&s;ion of council in the pre&s;ent
<PB N="144" REF="024407_0949_0FC72D8A2F06F4A8">
cau&s;e, con&s;idered to be <HI>not</HI> of admirality juri&s;|diction on account of the <HI>&s;ubject matter,</HI> I am at a lo&s;s to conceive; e&s;pecially when I look at the two only points of defence taken in that cau&s;e, viz. fir&s;t, that from the papers found on board the captured ve&s;&s;el, and from other concomitant circum&s;tances, there was a rea&s;onable colour for <HI>taking as original prize.</HI> And, &s;econdly, that if the Bet&s;y was indeed prize to Silas Talbot, the three brigs were in &s;ight at the time of the cap|ture, and by the maritime law, acquired thereby an intere&s;t in the property. I &s;ay, the&s;e pleas, to|gether with the current of the te&s;timony then ex|hibited, and the time of the tran&s;action, being time of war, all united in fixing that cau&s;e within the admiralty juri&s;diction, from the &s;ubject mat|ter, and the very nature of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is in obedience to &s;trong conviction that I thus venture to differ in opinion from the judgment of the honourable court of errors and appeals: a judgment which I am inclined to believe would not have taken place, but for the peculiar &s;ituation of Talbot's cau&s;e. The court of appeals for the United States, in prize-cau&s;es, had rejected the appeal, becau&s;e the
<PB N="145" REF="024407_0950_0FC72D8C0923AD08">
que&s;tion was not &s;trictly, <HI>prize or no prize?</HI> but an action for damages between citizen and citi|zen. That court, as I have under&s;tood, looked at that cau&s;e in no other point of view, and there|fore refu&s;ed to take cognizance of it, and &s;oon after was di&s;&s;olved. The appeal was then car|ried to the high court of errors and appeals for this commonwealth. Here the proctors had made a previous agreement, not to conte&s;t the point of juri&s;diction; and &s;o the cau&s;e came be|fore the judges on the merits only, and the court proceeded to &s;entence without &s;u&s;pecting their juri&s;diction. After &s;entence, however, &s;ome of the judges began to entertain &s;cruples re&s;pect|ing the juri&s;diction of the court; and, on enquiry, found that the juri&s;diction had only been &s;ubmit|ted to by con&s;ent. The court well knew that con&s;ent could not give legal juri&s;diction; and there|upon retracted or &s;u&s;pended the &s;entence until an argument &s;hould be held on that point: and the que&s;tion of juri&s;diction was again agitated. In the mean time, that is between the rejection of the cau&s;e by the court of appeals for the United States, and its introduction into the court of the commonwealth, the ca&s;e of Le Caux ver&s;us Eden, as reported by Dougla&s;s, with Lord Mansfield's di&s;&s;ertion on admiralty juri&s;diction &s;ubjoined, made
<PB N="146" REF="024407_0951_0FC72D8D8AF29CC0">
their fir&s;t appearance among&s;t us, and furni&s;hed new ideas re&s;pecting the court of admiralty. Then, for the fir&s;t time, did the di&s;tinction occur, between the <HI>prize</HI>-court and the <HI>in&s;tance</HI>-court of admiralty. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this idea, the judges of appeal for the &s;tate, looked at the proceedings which the court of admiralty had adopted in the ca&s;e before them, and found they had been <HI>in per&s;onam,</HI> by attachment, to an&s;wer for damages ari&s;ing from a tort committed at &s;ea. This, it was ob&s;erved, was never the practice in the <HI>prize</HI>-court, which always proceeded <HI>in rem,</HI> by procla|mation and monition, whether the property be in fact in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the court or not: and &s;o it was in the ca&s;e of the king ver&s;us Broom, <HI>Carth.</HI> 398. by proclamation at the Royal Ex|change, although the prize taken had been previ|ou&s;ly &s;old at Barbadoes. And for this error of form in the admiralty, <HI>Talbot's</HI> ca&s;e was con&s;idered as belonging to the <HI>in&s;tance</HI>-court. The judges of apppeal con&s;idered them&s;elves as an <HI>in&s;tance</HI>-court of appeal, and &s;o proceded to the definitive de|cree.</P>
<P>HAD the court of admiralty, when Talbot's cau&s;e fir&s;t made its appearance there, been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of the light which hath been &s;ince thrown up|on
<PB N="147" REF="024407_0952_0FC72D98DCFBD878">
this &s;ubject, it is very probable that the proce&s;s would have been conducted otherwi&s;e than it was. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved, however, that an <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> juri&s;diction cannot be &s;ubverted by an erroneous proce&s;s.</P>
<P>HOW far the con&s;ideration, that if the court of appeals for the commonwealth &s;hould reject Tal|bot's cau&s;e (as the court for the United States had done) the appellants would have had no other re|&s;ource, and &s;o have been deprived of the benefit of an appeal altogether, might have operated to induce the judges to take that within their cogni|zance as an <HI>in&s;tance</HI>-court, I will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay; but the peculiar circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e ought to be remembered: and I have mentioned them on this occa&s;ion from a &s;en&s;e of the duty I owe to the juri&s;diction entru&s;ted to my care.</P>
<P>I come now to con&s;ider the origin of the cau&s;e now before me, and whether it is, or is not, nece&s;|&s;arily dependant upon, and con&s;equential to, the ca&s;e of Silas Talbot.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid, that this &s;uit is derived from three circum&s;tances, viz. the contract by which Angus was made captain of the Hibernia, the wrongful taking at &s;ea, and the damages the li|bellants
<PB N="148" REF="024407_0953_0FC72D9B33718E40">
have been obliged to pay in con&s;equence of this contract and wrongful taking. And it has been urged, that as two of the&s;e circum&s;tances viz. the contract and the payment of damages, happened on the land, the common law, by the &s;econd general rule, hath the exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>IT appears to me, however, that owners are an&s;werable for torts done by the captains they employ, under a general principle of law, and not by virtue of any &s;pecial contract whatever. No &s;uch re&s;pon&s;ibility can be deduced from any articles, or failing orders given to captains of ve&s;&s;els. The contract may be the ground of an action of da|mages for a breach of orders, re&s;pecting the par|ticular intere&s;ts of the owners; but in ca&s;es of tort the owners are an&s;werable by a general law. The libellants have been obliged to pay the dama|ges in Talbot's ca&s;e, not becau&s;e they employed captain Angus, but becau&s;e they were owners of the brigs.</P>
<P>NEITHER can I con&s;ider the payment of mo|nies, according to the decree in favour of Silas Talbot, as the origin of the pre&s;ent &s;uit. We &s;hould not &s;top &s;hort in the train of cau&s;es.

would have pa&s;t, no damages have been paid, nor would the pre&s;ent &s;uit have been in&s;tituted, but for the original wrong done at &s;ea. To this wrong, therefore, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e for the &s;ource of the pre&s;ent action.</P>
<P>SOME pains have been taken to apply the ca&s;e of ran&s;om bills, charter parties, and policies of in&s;urance, all &s;ueable at common law, to the pre|&s;ent &s;uit. A ran&s;om bill &s;uppo&s;es a dive&s;ture of property by the rights of war, and the bill is a promi&s;&s;ory note for a certain &s;um, in con&s;idera|tion of the victor's relinqui&s;hing his right of con|que&s;t, and re&s;toring the property. In a &s;uit, therefore, on a ran&s;om bill, the que&s;tion of <HI>prize or no prize</HI> can only come in incidentally, to &s;hew whether there was value received or not. For if the taking was wrongful, the property never di|ve&s;ted, and of cour&s;e the promi&s;&s;ory bill was gi|ven without con&s;ideration. Charter parties, and policies of in&s;urance, are written contracts, execu|ted on land, re&s;pecting certain &s;pecific contingen|cies: it is immaterial where the&s;e contingencies &s;hall happen. The &s;uit is founded on the bind|ing force of the contract, and the contingencies are only incidental circum&s;tances, &s;hewing that the force of the contract is to take place and ope|rate. But the&s;e are not parallel with the ca&s;e
<PB N="150" REF="024407_0955_0FC72DA20CCBAA50">
before the court, wherein the libellants complain of damages they have &s;u&s;tained in con&s;equence of a tort committed at &s;ea by the captain they had employed.</P>
<P>WHEN the ca&s;e of Silas Talbot came fir&s;t be|fore this court, the libel was filed in the name of Silas Talbot, <HI>qui tam,</HI> again&s;t the brigs Achilles, Patty, and Hibernia, and again&s;t certain per&s;ons in the &s;aid libel named, as owners and captains of the &s;aid brigs. All the&s;e per&s;ons (except two, if I rightly remember) appeared either in per&s;on or by proxy, and entered into &s;tipulations, according to the practice of the court. In this form the &s;uit commenced, and proceeded through the admiralty, and through the court of appeals. The que&s;tion was general in both courts, viz. Whether there had been a wrong done? and if &s;o, whether the parties who appeared as re&s;pondents to the libel, were an&s;werable for the damage, and to what amount? And, finally, the decree was al&s;o general&mdash;That the appellants &s;hould pay to the appellee certain monies in recompence of the injury &s;u&s;tained. But how far any particular captain, or the owners of any particular ve&s;&s;el might have ju&s;tified them&s;elves by a &s;eparate defence, was never the &s;ubject of en|quiry. No &s;uch &s;pecific ju&s;tification having been proffered in either court. And whether it is, or is
<PB N="151" REF="024407_0956_0FC72DAD5B923E28">
not now too late, to make di&s;crimination, may be the &s;ubject of future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: but I mention this to &s;hew, that the pre&s;ent libel ri&s;es out of Talbot's ca&s;e, and that its pur&s;uit will unavoidably force us up to the wrongful taking <HI>as prize</HI> for the origin of the pre&s;ent &s;uit. Since then, I cannot but con|&s;ider the ca&s;e of Silas Talbot, as properly belong|ing to the <HI>prize</HI>-court of admiralty, and that the pre&s;ent &s;uit originates from, and is a &s;upplementary part of that tran&s;action, I cannot (according to the fir&s;t principle &s;tated) but over-rule the pre&s;ent plea to the juri&s;diction of this court.</P>
<P>I conclude with this ob&s;ervation&mdash;That in all pleas of this kind, where the law is doubtful, the leaning of the court will be in favour of its own juri&s;diction&mdash;not from a de&s;ire of extending the admiralty cognizance, but for this con&s;ideration&mdash; That if the deci&s;ion in favour of the juri&s;diction &s;hould be erroneous, the doors of the common law are open for redre&s;s, and a prohibition may be obtained. But there is no remedy for the er|roneous exclu&s;ion of parties who apply for the proce&s;s of the admiralty, the benefit of the laws by which it is governed, and the &s;ummary ju&s;tice it affords.</P>

<HEAD>DEAN, AND OTHERS, ver&s;us JOHN ANGUS. JUDGMENT ON THE MERITS.</HEAD>
<P>THE bill filed in this ca&s;e &s;tates, "That John Angus, being commander of the brig Hibernia, belonging to Jo&s;eph Dean and others, did, on a certain day, without any licence, order, or autho|rity, from his owners, and without any probable cau&s;e of capture, with a view to his own private intere&s;t and emolument, combine and confederate with certain malefactors, and did pur&s;ue and take the brigantine Bet&s;ey, then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Silas Talbot, commander of the &s;loop Argo, as lawful prize and booty of war.

<P>I have found it nece&s;&s;ary to the determination of
<PB N="154" REF="024407_0959_0FC72DB606442428">
the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, to con&s;ider it under the three following points of view, viz.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> How far the cau&s;e now before the court may be con&s;idered as connected with, or determi|ned by the decree in the ca&s;e of Silas Talbot.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> UNDER what circum&s;tances owners of ve&s;&s;els ought to recover again&s;t the captains they employ for damages &s;uffered in con&s;equence of their mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P><HI>Third,</HI> THE &s;pecific circum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, as they &s;tand on the te&s;timony, or what is called the merits of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t point&mdash;I can &s;ee no connection between this cau&s;e, and the ca&s;e of Silas Talbot, further than this; that as it originates in the &s;ame tran&s;action, viz. <HI>a taking as prize on the high &s;eas,</HI> the juri&s;diction is thereby determined. In all other re&s;pects the two cau&s;es proceed on different prin|ciples&mdash;The points in view in Talbot's ca&s;e were &mdash;how far owners of ve&s;&s;els were an&s;werable for torts committed by the captains they employ? and whether the <HI>taking</HI> in que&s;tion was in fact &s;uch a tort as they ought to be an&s;werable for? The ob|jects in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e are&mdash;Under what circum|&s;tances
<PB N="155" REF="024407_0960_0FC72DC34897F380">
owners may recover again&s;t their captains, and whether captain Angus was, or was not, <HI>parti|ceps criminis</HI> with the wrong doers in Talbot's ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE complexion of the two cau&s;es being thus manife&s;tly different, it cannot, with any rea&s;on, be admitted, that the te&s;timony or decree, founded thereupon in the former, &s;hould be conclu&s;ive in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. The decree, in Talbot's ca&s;e, was again&s;t certain per&s;ons, who by &s;tipulations, had made them&s;elves re&s;pon&s;ible for the i&s;&s;ue of that &s;uit on general principles. It is not incon&s;i&s;|tent with the record of that decree, for captain Angus, who was not one of tho&s;e &s;tipulants, and who was no party in that &s;uit, to come in now and make his defence, when per&s;onally called upon to an&s;wer, and to &s;hew that he was not one of the wrong doers, <HI>again&s;t whom</HI> that decree was ob|tained.</P>
<P>ON the &s;econd point, viz.&mdash;Under what circum|&s;tances owners of ve&s;&s;els ought to recover again&s;t the captains they employ, for damages &s;uffered in con&s;equence of their mi&s;conduct? It is con&s;onant with rea&s;on and authority, that captains are not an&s;werable for lo&s;&s;es ari&s;ing from unavoidable ac|cidents,
<PB N="156" REF="024407_0961_0FC72DC50AA6A770">
mere errors of judgment, or failure of &s;ucce&s;s, after having exerci&s;ed all rea&s;onable dili|gence and di&s;cretion. It would be very difficult, and at pre&s;ent unnece&s;&s;ary to delineate the particu|lar circum&s;tances and kinds of mi&s;conduct, which &s;hould render a captain re&s;pon&s;ible to his owners. Every ca&s;e that occurs mu&s;t be judged of, by its own peculiar circum&s;tances. The pre&s;ent libel &s;tates, "That John Angus did, without any au|thority from his owners, combine with certain malefactors, and without probable cau&s;e of cap|ture, take the brig Bet&s;ey, then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Silas Talbot, as prize and booty of war: and that he did this, not ignorantly, but well knowing the circum&s;tances, and with a view to injure the &s;aid Silas Talbot, and al&s;o his owners, as much as in him lay." If the&s;e charges are &s;upported by te&s;timony now before the court, there can be no doubt, but that he ought to be an&s;werable to his owners for whatever they have &s;uffered by his mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>AND this leads to the third point, viz.&mdash;The con&s;ideration of the &s;pecific circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, as exhibited by the te&s;timony, or the merits of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="024407_0962_0FC72DC6AC4D4F00">THE facts, &s;o far as they re&s;pect captain Angus, appear to be in &s;ub&s;tance the&s;e:</P>
<P>ANGUS &s;ailed on a trading voyage from Phila|delphia to Teneriffe, in the armed letter of marque brig, <HI>Hibernia,</HI> in company with the brigs <HI>Patty</HI> and <HI>Achilles,</HI> al&s;o letters of marque, and bound to &s;ome ports in Europe, under the commands of captains <HI>Prole</HI> and <HI>Thomp&s;on.</HI> Angus had receiv|ed written in&s;tructions from his owners (the pre|&s;ent libellants) to keep company with the two brigs as long as he &s;hould think it prudent, and had their approbation to crui&s;e with them on the coa&s;t for two or three weeks, if they &s;hould &s;o agree. Be|ing at Reedy I&s;land, in the Delaware, a con&s;ulta|tion was held between the three captains, and Prole was appointed commodore of this little &s;qua|dron. Soon after they had got out to &s;ea, they di&s;covered a brig and a &s;loop at a di&s;tance. Prole, as commodore, gave orders to cha&s;e, which was done. Prole and Thomp&s;on, under Briti&s;h co|lours, came up with, and took the brig, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the Hibernia, being a dull &s;ailor, was left four or five miles a&s;tern. When &s;he came up, captain Angus enquired what the captured ve&s;&s;el was, and was informed by Prole, or Thomp&s;on, that &s;he was a good prize, bound from Mont&s;erat to New York. To which Angus replied, that if the brig was prize, the &s;loop (then in &s;ight) mu&s;t be
<PB N="158" REF="024407_0963_0FC72DD459DFD338">
&s;o too: and a&s;ked why one of their fa&s;t &s;ailing brigs did not pur&s;ue her? To which it was an|&s;wered, that they did not choo&s;e to leave the prize till &s;he was well manned; but ordered him to cha&s;e the &s;loop, which he accordingly did, for two or three leagues; but finding he could not come up with her, he hawled his wind, and beat up again for the other brigs, but did not reach them till dark. Prole then &s;ent a boat to Angus, de|manding two of his hands to man the prize, for|warding, at the &s;ame time, a paper for Angus to &s;ign, which appears to have been orders drawn up by Prole, and &s;igned by him and Thomp&s;on, for the prize-ma&s;ter, to who&s;e charge they had com|mitted the captured brig. Angus ha&s;tily &s;igned this paper on the binnacle, and &s;ent the two men required. The wind then blowing fre&s;h, the &s;ea running high, and night coming on, the four brigs &s;eparated and &s;aw each other no more.</P>
<P>FROM this detail, it is manife&s;t, that Angus had no opportunity of acquiring information of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which were the ground of condemna|tion again&s;t the re&s;pondents in the &s;uit of Si|las Talbot. The a&s;&s;urance of Prole, the com|modore, that the Bet&s;ey was good prize, was, in the then &s;ituation of affairs, &s;ufficient to convince Angus that there was at lea&s;t probable cau&s;e of capture. And if the enterprize had been a &s;uc|ce&s;sful
<PB N="159" REF="024407_0964_0FC72DD6B615B018">
one, which he had no rea&s;on to doubt, An|gus would not have been ju&s;tifiable in neglecting any thing on his part to &s;ecure to his owners a &s;hare of the Bet&s;ey taken, or to add thereto, by endeavouring to take the &s;loop al&s;o.</P>
<P>THE only circum&s;tance which hath a direct ten|dency to criminate captain Angus, is his &s;igning the orders to the prize-ma&s;ter put on board the Bet&s;ey, directing to "keep to the &s;outhward, for fear of falling in with the Argo:" There are two ways in which this may very naturally be account|ed for, neither of which are in the lea&s;t contra|dicted by the te&s;timony, viz, that in the hurry of the tran&s;action, the boat waiting along &s;ide, the &s;ea rough, and night coming on, he &s;igned the&s;e or|ders without reading them, having confidence in tho&s;e who had drawn them up and &s;igned before him; or, according to his la&s;t conclu&s;ion, "if the brig was prize, the &s;loop mu&s;t be &s;o too," he &s;till conceived the Argo to be an enemy, and therefore to be avoided by the prize-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>BUT, without having recour&s;e to &s;urmi&s;es, I am clearly of opinion that the libel is not &s;upported by the te&s;timony; that is, there is not &s;ufficient proof that the re&s;pondent "did wilfully and knowing|ly, and without probable cau&s;e of capture, join
<PB N="160" REF="024407_0965_0FC72DDB543A3518">
with others, in taking from Silas Talbot his prize and booty of war."</P>
<P>IT is manife&s;t, indeed, from the records of the court of appeals, that the libellants have &s;uffered con&s;iderable damage in con&s;equence of this tran&s;|action at &s;ea. But, as they had embarked them|&s;elves in a &s;uit with real wrong-doers, and &s;uffer|ed judgment to go again&s;t them on general princi|ples, without attempting any &s;eparate defence, this is no rea&s;on why Angus &s;hould not bring for|ward &s;uch &s;pecific te&s;timony with regard to his own conduct as may exculpate him from the charges laid in the pre&s;ent libel.</P>
<P>SOME &s;tre&s;s has been laid on a pa&s;&s;age in the depo&s;ition of W&mdash; D&mdash;, exhibited in Tal|bot's cau&s;e, tending to prove that Angus was not &s;o ignorant of the circum&s;tances re&s;pecting the Bet|&s;ey and Argo, as he pretends. The pa&s;&s;age is in the&s;e words: "Afterwards, captains Prole, An|gus, and Thomp&s;on, in the pre&s;ence of this de|ponent, con&s;ulted what they &s;hould do with the brig Bet&s;ey, and being of opinion," &amp;c. What|ever weight this depo&s;ition might have had in Tal|bot's cau&s;e, it is inadmi&s;&s;ible in the pre&s;ent; but I would ob&s;erve that this circum&s;tance is not &s;up|ported by any other te&s;timony on the records of
<PB N="161" REF="024407_0966_0FC72DDC46D509E8">
this court: on the contrary, from the general hi&s;|tory of the tran&s;action, there &s;eems to have been no period of time in which Angus could have left his ve&s;&s;el, or the other captains have been on board the Hibernia to hold this con&s;ultation; W&mdash; D&mdash; mu&s;t therefore have been mi&s;taken. In|deed this is not the only circum&s;tance in which he is &s;ingular. For ju&s;t before, he &s;ays, "The brigs Achilles and Hibernia endeavoured to &s;peak her (meaning the Argo) but could not come up with her. And, upon the &s;aid Churche's &s;aying, that cap|tain Talbot was not a man that would run from <HI>one</HI> of them if they would not both cha&s;e, the brig Achilles then cha&s;ed alone."</P>
<P>NOW, the whole current of te&s;timony agrees in this, that it was the Hibernia and not the Achilles that cha&s;ed the Argo. And as I remember, in &s;ome &s;tage of Talbot's &s;uit, it was urged as an ag|gravating circum&s;tance again&s;t the owners of the Hibernia, that their captain was employed in driv|ing off the Argo, whil&s;t her confederates were plundering her prize.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations on W&mdash; D&mdash;'s depo|&s;ition cannot directly affect the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, becau&s;e that depo&s;ition is not an exhibit in this cau&s;e; but I mention them, becau&s;e if I could find
<PB N="162" REF="024407_0967_0FC72DE6788694C0">
any &s;ub&s;tantial ground that Angus was indeed <HI>par|ticeps criminis</HI> with Prole and Thomp&s;on, or that he knew, or had any opportunity of knowing, the circum&s;tances which &s;hould have prohibited them from making that unfortunate capture, I &s;hould not be &s;o clear as I now am in adjudging</P>
<P>THAT the bill in this cau&s;e be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and that the libellants pay the co&s;ts of &s;uit.</P>
<P>THE libellants; appealed and after long argu|ment, the court adjudged in June 1785, that John Angus &s;hould pay to the appellants, &pound;. 948:15:10, with intere&s;t thereon, from the 22d day of Janua|ry 1785.</P>

<P>THIS is a &s;uit brought on a bottomry bond, given by John Wal&s;h to the libellants at O&s;tend, whereby he hypothecates the &s;hip Emperor, of which he was then the captain, for 4500 florins, equal to &pound;. 409:1:9 &s;terling money of Great Bri|tain, advanced for repairs of the &s;aid &s;hip. Where|upon James Oellers, the owner of this &s;hip, and others, his a&s;&s;ignees, come in, and an&s;wer to the libel, alledging that this bottomry bond ought not to take effect <HI>as an hypothecation according to the maritime law.</HI></P>
<P>THE power ve&s;ted in a ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el to im|pawn his owners &s;hip or goods for nece&s;&s;aries fur|ni&s;hed in a foreign port, is a legal indulgence, founded on the urgency of the ca&s;e, and is for the general benefit of commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="024407_0969_0FC72DED6E175100">THERE are few rules of law more &s;trictly de|fined than this of hypothecation, and none in which the rea&s;on and intention of the law are more manife&s;t: it is thus delineated.</P>
<P>"A ma&s;ter of a &s;hip hath no power to take up money by bottomry, in places where his owner or owners dwell." "But when a ma&s;ter is out of the country, and where he hath no owners, nor any goods of theirs, nor of his own, and cannot find means to take up by exchange, or otherwi&s;e, and that for want of money the voyage might be re|tarded or overthrown, monies may be taken up up|on bottomry."&mdash;<HI>Molloy,</HI> book II. chap. ii. &s;ect. 11." &mdash;"And the money &s;o taken up by the ma&s;ter, is done upon great extremity, and that for the completing of the voyage, when they are in di&s;|tre&s;s and want, in &s;ome foreign parts."&mdash;Sect. 12.</P>
<P>ALL the books agree in the &s;pirit of this doc|trine. The extreme nece&s;&s;ity appears every where to be the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of the law, and the <HI>intention</HI> to favour commerce. Let us now take a view of the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. The leading facts appear from the te&s;timony exhibited, to be the&s;e:</P>
<P>THE &s;hip <HI>Emperor,</HI> John Wal&s;h ma&s;ter, belong|ing to James Oellers, of Philadelphia, &s;ailed for
<PB N="165" REF="024407_0970_0FC72DEE50A99C18">
O&s;tend, with a cargo of tobacco on board: the &s;hip and cargo being con&s;igned by the owner to <HI>Bine, Overman</HI> and <HI>Company,</HI> merchants at <HI>O&s;tend.</HI> During the voyage the ve&s;&s;el was &s;o much damaged by a &s;torm at &s;ea, that the captain was obliged to put into Dover in England, in di&s;tre&s;s. From Do|ver, the captain &s;ent immediate notice of his &s;itua|tion to the con&s;ignees at O&s;tend, and they &s;peedi|ly furni&s;hed him with a credit on London, by which he rai&s;ed money &s;ufficient to refit the &s;hip. After this he &s;ailed from Dover, and arrived at O&s;tend, where the con&s;ignees took charge of the &s;hip and cargo.</P>
<P>BEFORE the ve&s;&s;el arrived at O&s;tend, <HI>Bine, O|verman,</HI> and <HI>Co.</HI> had accepted bills to a con&s;idera|ble amount, drawn upon them by <HI>Oellers,</HI> on the credit of this con&s;ignment. Upon clo&s;ing all ac|counts, Bine, Overman, and Co. found that Oel|lers had not only drawn upon them to the full amount of the cargo and freight, ("the tobacco not &s;elling &s;o well as was expected") but that there remained a con&s;iderable ballance in their favour. To &s;ecure this ballance, they tell captain Wal&s;h that he &s;hall not leave the port, unle&s;s he will repay them the monies advanced at Dover for repairs, or hypothecate the &s;hip. It was not in captain Wal&s;h's power to do the one, that is, to repay
<PB N="166" REF="024407_0971_0FC72DF7EBB4D3D8">
the money, and he declined the other propo&s;al for &s;ome time: but finding expences accumulating, and that he could not &s;ail without &s;ome accommo|dation, he at la&s;t con&s;ented to hypothecate the &s;hip. Bine, Overman, and Co. then recommended him to <HI>Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn</HI> and <HI>Co.</HI> telling him that they would lend money on bottomry; and con|ducted him to their hou&s;e, where he executed the bottomry bond now in que&s;tion. But no money was paid to Wal&s;h; for the bills for repairs at Do|ver had been long &s;ince di&s;charged by the produce of the credit on London.</P>
<P>AFTER this, Bine, Overman, and Co. permitted captain Wal&s;h to &s;ail, and in due time he arrived at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, Oellers had failed, and a&s;&s;igned this &s;hip to his creditors; and the que&s;tion now is&mdash;Whether this bottomry bond &s;hall operate to the exclu&s;ive &s;ecurity of the mer|chant's at O&s;tend, again&s;t all other creditors, as a genuine hypothecation would do, on the principles of the maritime law?</P>
<P>AFTER a careful con&s;ideration of the circum|&s;tances of the ca&s;e, I cannot di&s;cover one real fea|ture of that rule of law which &s;hould be the ground
<PB N="167" REF="024407_0972_0FC72DF9FA846860">
of the pre&s;ent &s;uit. True it is, that the &s;hip was in nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;o is evey &s;hip that wants e&s;&s;ential repairs. But the owner had credit within reach. The con&s;ignees were not far di&s;tant. The appli|cation was ea&s;y and certain, and the con&s;ignees no &s;ooner heard of the di&s;a&s;ter, but they furni&s;hed the means of relief. In fact, Bine, Overman, and Co. had the &s;tronge&s;t inducement to exert them&s;elves in getting the &s;hip repaired at Dover, that &s;he might get round to O&s;tend; for they had made them&s;elves an&s;werable for Oellers's bills upon the credit of this cargo. It was, therefore, of impor|tance to them, that the cargo &s;hould arrive &s;afe to their hands. So that in&s;tead of ad|vancing money to a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tranger, they were only taking care of their own &s;ecurity. This mo|tive is manife&s;t by their letter to Wal&s;h at Dover; and &s;till further by their &s;ub&s;equent conduct: for after they had di&s;po&s;ed of the cargo, and found a ballance due from Oellers to them, they in&s;i&s;t that Wal&s;h &s;hall not &s;ail, unle&s;s he will hypothecate the &s;hip to Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn, and Co. which from all appearances &s;eems to be the &s;ame thing as hypo|thecating her to them&s;elves: for the captain re|ceived no money from Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn, and Co. who were not at all intere&s;ted in the tran&s;|action, and who&s;e names were only made u&s;e of to
<PB N="168" REF="024407_0973_0FC72DFE74536A90">
&s;ave appearances. For Bine, Overman, and Co. well knew, that being con&s;ignees, the captain had no power to hypothecate the ve&s;&s;el to them. And, in order to give the bottomry bond the face of a genuine hypothecation, they &s;elected from the ge|neral account, the monies &s;pent for repairs at Do|ver, and compelled the captain to hypothecate his &s;hip, <HI>as for tho&s;e particular charges,</HI> to the libel|lants, who had not advanced one &s;hilling towards that expence.</P>
<P>FURTHER, if we look into the accounts, we &s;hall find, that, although this voyage was not a very &s;ucce&s;sful one, yet the &s;hip cleared all charges accrued after &s;he &s;ailed from Philadelphia, even including the repairs at Dover. But Oellers had drawn upon Bine, Overman, and Co. on the cre|dit of the future voyage, long before the &s;hip &s;ail|ed from Philadelphia, to rai&s;e money to fit her out; and it is the&s;e drafts brought into account which make a ballance due to the con&s;ignees. So that, in&s;tead of an hypothecation made to enable a &s;hip to complete her voyage, it was, in fact, made to enable her owners to begin one; which was never the object of the maritime law in ca&s;es of hypothecation. Neither was this law ever de&s;ign|ed to give partial advantages in mercantile con|nections, or &s;ecure the ballance of a running ac|count

<P>THE importance of the pre&s;ent deci&s;ion to the commercial character of our country, has been &s;trongly urged in favour of the libellants. But I am not apprehen&s;ive on this account. The que&s;tion in view is not to be determined by any municipal law of the country, but by a general law, univer|&s;ally received and under&s;tood. And I am of opi|nion, that our national character would be much more likely to &s;uffer by an adjudged precedent, which might open a door for dangerous collu&s;ions, by putting it in the power of captains of ve&s;&s;els to &s;addle their owners with unnece&s;&s;ary obligations, or to give an unfair advantage to foreign creditors, by a fraudulent u&s;e of that pre-eminent lien which the law lays on a &s;hip and goods, properly hypo|thecated.</P>
<P>I do not mean to in&s;inuate that there has been any fraud or collu&s;ion in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. It is enough, that I do not find the claim of the libel|lants within the &s;pirit or intention of the maritime law: and, therefore, I adjudge,</P>

<P>AND it has been urged in &s;upport of the libel, that every contract of the captain for nece&s;&s;aries for a &s;hip implied an hypothecation, and induces a lien on the &s;hip in favour of the creditor, &s;ueable in the admiralty by the rules of civil law: and the ca&s;e principally relied upon as authority for this doctrine, is cited from Cowper, p. 636.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e referred to, is a &s;uit at common law, brought by a rope-maker again&s;t the owners of a &s;hip, for ropes furni&s;hed to the captain. The plaintiff having charged <HI>Harwood</HI> (the captain) and the owners of the &s;hip, for the ropes, without naming, or even knowing who the owners were.</P>
<P>THE fact was, that the owners, according to the cu&s;tom of the county of E&s;&s;ex, in England, where they probably re&s;ided, had lea&s;ed the &s;hip to Harwood for a term of years on certain condi|tions&mdash;and the que&s;tions were, Whether under the&s;e circum&s;tances, Harwood was not both cap|tain and owner during the term? And whether the

<P>LORD MANSFIELD was of opinion, that nei|ther the lea&s;e, nor the ignorance of the creditor as to the names or per&s;ons of the owners, could exonerate them. And to &s;hew that the owners are bound, he &s;ays.&mdash;"Suppo&s;e the &s;hip had been impounded in the admiralty, and <HI>that</HI> had hap|pened at the end of the term, the owners could not have had their &s;hip without paying the debt for which &s;he had been impounded."</P>
<P>BUT this ca&s;e is brought into view chiefly be|cau&s;e Lord Mansfield in giving his opinion, ob|&s;erves, that the creditor had three &s;ecurities for his debt, viz. the per&s;on of the captain with whom he contracted the <HI>&s;pecific &s;hip,</HI> and the owners.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be remembered, however, that this was a &s;uit at common law; that the owners, the &s;hip, the captain, the creditor, and the contract, were all within the realm. And there can be no doubt but that the creditor might have his action at law, either again&s;t the per&s;ons of the contrac|tors, or might attach their property, the &s;hip, for his debt.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="024407_0979_0FC72E118227FC98">BUT this ca&s;e has no reference whatever to the the maritime or civil law. The doctrine of hypo|thecation is never once mentioned, nor is the con|tract of the captain at all placed upon that ground. The principle object was to determine whether the lea&s;e of the &s;hip did not exonerate the le&s;&s;ors during the term.</P>
<P>SO in the ca&s;e cited from Vezay. p. 154.

And this is con&s;onant with the whole current of autho|rities re&s;pecting a maritime hypothecation, viz. that it mu&s;t be made during the voyage, and from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>EDWARD FORBES</HI> ver&s;us <HI>THE BRIG HANNAH:</HI> ANDREW HODGE, RESPONDENT.</HEAD>
<P>EDWARD FORBES of Dublin, in Ireland, has libelled again&s;t the brig Hannah, for the a|mount of certain bonds of bottomry, which Fran|cis Lewis, then captain and principal owner of the ve&s;&s;el, gave as &s;ecurity for monies advanced by Forbes, in the port of Dublin, for nece&s;&s;aries, as it is &s;aid, for the &s;aid brig, and to enable her to complete her voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="024407_0982_0FC72E1F01D427A8">THE circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e appear from the te&s;timony to be the&s;e:</P>
<P>FRANCIS LEWIS, principal owner of the brig Hannah, had chartered her to one <HI>Varlo,</HI> for a voy|age from &s;ome port in America to Dublin in Ire|land. Varlo him&s;elf went pa&s;&s;enger with his goods, and Lewis was captain for the voyage. Af|ter their arrival at Dublin, Lewis borrowed mo|ney of Forbes, at three &s;everal times, for which he gave three bonds of bottomry on his brig, a|mounting, with premium and charges, to &pound;.214:0:8 &s;terling money of Great Britain. Forbes then put a cargo on board the brig, in which it &s;eems that Lewis was concerned, as he was to have one-half of the nett profits of the adventure, exclu&s;ive of freight, and to be an&s;werable for one-half of the lo&s;s, if any there &s;hould be, on the &s;ales. Lewis left Dublin with his cargo, bound for Bo&s;ton in America. It does not appear whether ever he arrived at Bo&s;ton, or what he did with his cargo; but in April la&s;t he brought the brig into the port of Philadelphia, at which time &s;ome of his mari|ners &s;ued in this court for wages due, and the brig was attached and condemned for tho&s;e wages, a mounting to &pound;.29, Lewis making no plea of de|fence again&s;t the libel. In con&s;equence of this libel and &s;entence, a writ i&s;&s;ued to the mar&s;hal,
<PB N="178" REF="024407_0983_0FC72E209786FEB8">
in the u&s;ual form, directing him to &s;ell the brig Hannah, with her tackle, apparel, and furniture, <HI>or &s;uch parts thereof,</HI> as might be nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;a|tisfy the decree in favour of the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ners, toge|ther with the charges and co&s;ts of &s;uit. But Lew|is reque&s;ted the mar&s;hal to &s;ell <HI>the whole</HI> of the ve&s;&s;el, with her tackle, &amp;c. under the decree, and even endor&s;ed this reque&s;t on the writ of &s;ale. And to &s;hew that he was the &s;ole owner of the brig at that time, he exhibited to, and lodged with the mar&s;hal, an a&s;&s;ignment or bill of &s;ale from one Simp&s;on, who had been a part owner, of all his intere&s;t in the brig, to Lewis.</P>
<P><HI>ANDREW HODGE,</HI> re&s;pondent in this cau&s;e, pur|cha&s;ed the ve&s;&s;el at the mar&s;hal's &s;ale, and paid down the full con&s;ideration money, out of which the mar&s;hal deducted the mariners wages, with charges and co&s;ts of &s;uit, and paid the balance to Lewis as &s;ole owner. After this, Lewis went off without &s;aying any thing of the bottomry bonds he had given to Forbes in Dublin. And now the&s;e bonds have come over, and Forbes has attached the brig in the hands of Hodge the purcha&s;er.</P>
<P>ON the&s;e circum&s;tances, two que&s;tions have a|ri&s;en, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="024407_0984_0FC72E2E533F8550"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> WHETHER the&s;e bottomry bonds have hypothecated the ve&s;&s;el, according to the rules of maritime law, &s;o as to bring the cau&s;e within ad|miralty juri&s;diction?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> SUPPOSING it to be &s;o, whether the &s;ale and purcha&s;e, under the authority of this court, have not ve&s;ted the property in the re&s;pondent, exonerated of all prior engagements?</P>
<P>TO determine the fir&s;t point, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the characteri&s;tic marks which di&s;tin|gui&s;h an hypothecation, according to the maritime law, from a common bottomry bond or mortgage, according to the cu&s;tom of merchants, cognizable by the common law.</P>
<P>BY the maritime law
<Q>a ma&s;ter of a &s;hip hath no power to take up money by bottomry in pla|ces where his owners dwell; but when he is out of the country, and where he hath no ow|ners, or any goods of theirs, or his own, and cannot find means to take up, by exchange or otherwi&s;e, and that for want of money, the voy|age might be retarded or overthrown, monies may be taken up on bottomry.</Q>

<P><PB N="180" REF="024407_0985_0FC72E304BA2F930">FROM this it appears, that the true grounds of a maritime hypothecation are the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the ca&s;e, and the <HI>want of per&s;onal credit.</HI> Wherever this doctrine occurs in the books, the&s;e two cir|cum&s;tances are &s;trongly pointed at.

<P>IN 1&s;t. <HI>Magens,</HI> there is a report of an admiral|ty &s;uit on a bottomry bond, at the conclu&s;ion of which, p. 329. the author &s;ays, "Per&s;ons living in &s;ea ports may learn from this ca&s;e, not to be|lieve or tru&s;t too ea&s;ily a captain they do not know; and when they propo&s;e benefiting them|&s;elves by lending money on bottomry to &s;uch who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es oblige them to &s;eek it, the lenders, for their own &s;atisfaction and &s;ecurity, ought to

<P>FURTHER, the impawning mu&s;t be in foreign parts; that is, where neither the owner, nor ma|&s;ter hath any per&s;onal credit: for this con&s;titutes an e&s;&s;ential part of the nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;"The ma&s;ter can have no credit abroad but by hypothecation."

<P>THE rea&s;on is, the maritime law requires, that the monies &s;hould be lent &s;olely on the credit of the &s;hip, and that the &s;ecurity of the lender &s;hould depend altogether on her &s;afety: and there|fore, if &s;he be well engaged, that is according to the principles &s;tated, &s;he &s;hall be for ever obliged till redemption&mdash;Molloy book II. ch. ii. &s;ec. 15.

<P><PB N="182" REF="024407_0987_0FC72E35856D1960">SUCH are the principles which de&s;ignate a ma|ritime hypothecation within admiralty juri&s;diction.</P>

<P>IT &s;hould &s;eem by the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> &s;o frequently urged as the ground of a maritime hypothecation, that the &s;hip &s;hould be driven by di&s;tre&s;s into &s;ome other port than that of her de&s;tination; or, at lea&s;t, that &s;ome extraordinary ca&s;ualty &s;hould oc|ca&s;ion an unfore&s;een and inevitable expence in the port of her voyage.

<P>IN the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it does not appear, nor has it been &s;ugge&s;ted, that any extraordinary circum|&s;tances occa&s;ioned an unfore&s;een nece&s;&s;ity. The cap|tain (Lewis), who was al&s;o principal owner, ar|rives

after a pro&s;perous voyage at the port of de|&s;tination with his freighter on board. Here the voyage is completed, and it may be pre&s;umed that he there received his freight. If &s;o, he could not be without money &s;ufficient to refit his ve&s;&s;el for a new voyage. And that he was not without per&s;onal credit is manife&s;t, becau&s;e Forbes entru&s;t|ed him with a new cargo, and agreed to allow him 35<HI>&s;</HI>0 Iri&s;h money per ton for freight on all the goods he &s;hould deliver: and al&s;o one half of the nett profits ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of the cargo, he to run one half of the ri&s;k of lo&s;s.

<P>BESIDES, if we look into the accounts, we &s;hall find the fir&s;t article charged is &pound;. 32:5:6 &s;ter|ling paid to Varlo, by Lewis's order, to take up and cancel a former bottomry bond. It &s;eems &s;trange that Lewis, after navigating Varlo and his goods acro&s;s the &s;ea, &s;hould fall in his debt. This circum&s;tance is not at all accounted for. But be it as it may, Forbes &s;hould certainly have forwar|ded his former bottomry bond, with an account of the occa&s;ion and expenditures for which it was given, that a judgment might have been formed whether it was a proper hypothecation or not:

<HEAD>MANUEL SAGAS DE CANIZARES ver&s;us THE SANTISSIMA TRINIDAD. JUAN JOSEPH DE AGUIRE PEREZ, <HI>Re&s;pondent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE libel in this cau&s;e &s;tates two &s;eparate claims of Canizares, the complainant, again&s;t the brigantine Santi&s;&s;ima Trinidad: the one founded on an hypothecation of the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el, made by the then captain to Santiago Cupi&s;ono at Havan|nah, for two hundred dollars advanced by the &s;aid Cupi&s;ono for nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;aid brigan|tine, as it is &s;aid, and to enable her to pro&s;ecute her voyage; which in&s;trument of hypothecation is endor&s;ed or a&s;&s;igned over by the lender to the pre&s;ent libellant: and the other, founded on a writ|ten contract between Nari&s;co Sanchez y Serna, then captain of the ve&s;&s;el, and Canizares the libel|lant, re&s;pecting the wages he &s;hould receive for &s;erving as pilot and mariner on board the &s;aid bri|gantine in her voyage from Havannah to Philadel|phia. As the&s;e claims ari&s;e from different con|tracts,
<PB N="186" REF="024407_0991_0FC72E49B024DFF8">
it is manife&s;t that they mu&s;t be &s;eparately con&s;idered.</P>
<P>TO determine on the force of this in&s;trument of bottomry, I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;tate the circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary to a genuine hypothecation, accord|ing to the maritime law; and then take a view of the hi&s;tory of this ve&s;&s;el's voyage, and her &s;ituation at Havannah when Cupi&s;ono advanced the money in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t, I have had occa&s;ion in three for|mer &s;uits in this court, to &s;tate the law of a mari|time hypothecation, and have not &s;ince found rea|&s;on to alter my opinion of the principles on which tho&s;e cau&s;es were decided. The cau&s;es to which I refer were Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn and Co. again&s;t the &s;hip Emperor, Turnbull again&s;t the &s;hip En|terpri&s;e, and Forbes again&s;t the brig Hannah. I can only now repeat the &s;ub&s;tance of what was then ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>[<HI>Here the judge recapitulated the doctrines ad|vanced, and the authorities cited, in the ca&s;es referred to.</HI>]</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;tate the hi&s;tory of the voyage of this brigantine, as the &s;ame may be deduced from the te&s;timony.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="024407_0992_0FC72E4B4D7B5EC8">IT appears that this ve&s;&s;el had been chartered on account of the king of Spain, and was to &s;ail from Philadelphia to Carthagena with a cargo of flour which was to be &s;old there, and a cargo of dyewood purcha&s;ed and brought back to Philadel|phia, or &s;ome port of the United States. Such was the de&s;ignated voyage; but it &s;eems the cap|tain, in&s;tead of returning to Philadelphia from Carthagena, went to Jamaica with an adventure of his own; to what amount does not appear: that at Jamaica he purcha&s;ed dry goods fit for the Ha|vannah market, and then took the brig to Ha|vannah, where he di&s;po&s;ed of the goods he had bought at Jamaica upon his own account: that at Havannah he borrowed two hundred dollars of Cupi&s;ono, and executed the in&s;trument called the hypothecation, to engage the ve&s;&s;el and her freight for this &s;um: that part of this money was ex|pended in paying wages to the mariners, and part in &s;upplying them with fre&s;h provi&s;ions: that the ve&s;&s;el was refitted at the king's ar&s;enal, and at the expence of the intendant: and that &s;he &s;ailed for, and arrived at the port of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I agree with the council for the libellant, that the validity of an hypothecation ought not to de|pend on the regularity of the captain's conduct with re&s;pect to his owners, previous to the time
<PB N="188" REF="024407_0993_0FC72E4CC5CF8C80">
of his arrival in a foreign port, and borrowing money for the relief of the &s;hip's nece&s;&s;ities; and will go further, and &s;ay, that neither&punc; ought it to be affected by the captain's &s;ub&s;equent conduct; provided the lender was in no wi&s;e privy to, or knowingly a&s;&s;i&s;tant in his obliquities.</P>
<P>IT has been urged on the other &s;ide, that the law of hppothecation was de&s;igned &s;olely for the benefit of the owners, and an inference drawn, that if it can be &s;hewn, that the owners of a ve&s;&s;el have not been benefited, but injured by the cap|tains conduct, and con&s;equent hypothecation, it ought not to be allowed. But this law has for its object the good of commerce in general. And no &s;tranger would lend money on hypothecation if his lien on the &s;hip was to be invalidated by &s;ome future proof that the voyage was irregular, or that the captain had deviated from the orders of his owners, and injured their intere&s;t, either before or after the hypothecation made.</P>
<P>BUT where &s;hall we find, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, that <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> which &s;hould ju&s;tify the captains conduct, and be the ground of a genuine hypothecation? This ve&s;&s;el was chartered for the u&s;e of the king of Spain by his agent: the cargo on board was on the king's account, and &s;he arrives in a lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">
<PB N="189" REF="024407_0994_0FC72E4E42E71290">
and di&s;abled condition in one of his Maje&s;ty's ports, where he had an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fficer &s;tationed. This officer, the intendant, orders the ve&s;&s;el to the public warehou&s;e to be di&s;charged, and then round to the king's ar&s;enal to be repaired; all which was done at the king's expence. In truth, I cannot conceive a ca&s;e of le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity, or one wherein a more certain and able relief could be de|pended upon.</P>
<P>BUT it is &s;aid, that there were con&s;iderable de|lays before the intendant interfered; and that the captain was obliged to &s;end in five or &s;ix memori|als, and in the mean time the mariners were in great want of wages and fre&s;h provi&s;ions; and that in this nece&s;&s;ity the captain applied to Cupi|&s;ono for two hundred dollars, who refu&s;ed to lend them unle&s;s the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be hypothecated for his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>IT is in te&s;timony, however, that this money was lent by Cupi&s;ono before the captain had made any application to the intendant, and therefore, the neglect of the intendant could not have occa&s;ioned the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing from Cupi&s;ono: that the captain of a ve&s;&s;el in the king's &s;ervice, and in one of his maje&s;ty's ports, &s;hould not find credit for a few days provi&s;ions until the proper officer
<PB N="190" REF="024407_0995_0FC72E57ACBF6220">
could be applied to, is too incredible to be &s;e|riou&s;ly admitted: &s;till le&s;s can it be a legal ground for an hypothecation, that the mariners mu&s;t have wages paid to them in a place where it does not appear that any wages were due; nor is it pro|bable that any could be due, becau&s;e this was neither the conclu&s;ion of the voyage, nor even a port of delivery.</P>
<P>THE money ought to have been lent &s;olely on the faith of the hypothecation and not on any per|&s;onal credit: but here was a &s;trong and well founded credit; for it is in the proof that Cupi|&s;ono knew that this ve&s;&s;el was chartered for the king's &s;ervice; and it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, that the mo|ney was borrowed to pay wages and procure fre&s;h provi&s;ions&mdash;"<HI>until money could be had from the intendant.</HI>"</P>
<P>FURTHER, in the quotation from Molloy B. II. ch. xi. &s;ec. 11. it is &s;aid&mdash;"When a ma&s;ter is out of the country, and where he hath no owners, nor any goods of theirs, <HI>nor of his own.</HI>"&mdash;Now it is confe&s;t that the captain had goods of his own, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to a con&s;iderable amount, &s;ince it was &s;ufficient to induce him to violate his duty to his employers, in taking the ve&s;&s;el, contra|ry to their orders, on a trading voyage to Jamaica
<PB N="191" REF="024407_0996_0FC72E59905388F0">
for his own benefit; that at Jamaica he bought goods &s;uitable for the Havannah market, and ac|tually &s;old them at the Havannah though contra|band; and that Cupi&s;ono, the lender, was privy to the&s;e circum&s;tances. So that in&s;tead of the lender's having the ve&s;&s;el alone to look to for his &s;ecurity, he had two &s;ub&s;tantial per&s;onal credits to depend upon, viz. the intendant, from whom he might rea&s;onably expect repayment of monies advanced for the u&s;e of a ve&s;&s;el in the king's employ; and the captain, who&s;e property he might have attach|ed before he left the i&s;land, if &s;atisfaction was not made. This circum&s;tance alone, that is to &s;ay, Cupi&s;ono's knowledge that the captain had proper|ty of his own on the &s;pot, &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the pre&s;ent exigencies of the ve&s;&s;el, would have invali|dated the bond as a maritime hypothecation, ina&s;|much as it removes that <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> which the law requires.</P>
<P>THERE is a circum&s;tance in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, which although not in it&s;elf conclu&s;ive, forms too &s;triking a feature in the tran&s;action to pa&s;s unno|ticed. A &s;ingularity in a maritime hypothecation is, that the law allows an extraordinary premium or intere&s;t to the lender, to any extent, according to the ri&s;k to be run&punc; becau&s;e, if the &s;hip &s;hould be lo&s;t, the money lent is lo&s;t with her. But
<PB N="192" REF="024407_0997_0FC72E5B209DEE08">
here, a &s;tranger lends two hundred dollars to a captain in di&s;tre&s;s without even &s;tipulating for common legal intere&s;t for the u&s;e of his money: I &s;ay, this alone might not be conclu&s;ive again&s;t the hypothecation, becau&s;e a man may be as ge|nerous as he plea&s;es; but in connection with the other circum&s;tances, it gives room for &s;u&s;picion, that the engagement of this ve&s;&s;el to Cupi&s;ono was not made within the rules or &s;pirit of the ma|ritime law.</P>
<P>FOR the above rea&s;ons, I adjudge that the bill in this cau&s;e be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;o far as the &s;ame hath re&s;pect to a claim of two hundred dollars, &s;aid to have been lent on the credit of the brigantine Santi&s;&s;ima Trinidad.</P>
<P>I am now to con&s;ider the libellant's demand of wages for &s;erving as pilot and mariner on board this ve&s;&s;el from Havannah to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>THIS claim for wages, amounting to &pound;.87:5:0, is founded on a written contract made at the Havannah between Nari&s;co Sanchez y Serna,

<P>BUT it has been contended, that as this agree|ment is in writing, and bears a &s;eal, and is not, ac|cording to the terms thereof, in the u&s;ual way of a|greeing for mariners wages, it becomes a &s;pecial contract, and is not properly of admiralty juri&s;|diction.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="024407_0999_0FC72A200BDF2388">ITS being in writing, however, is no more than a te&s;timony or memorandum of the agreement made, and does not affect the juri&s;diction of this court. What is called a &s;eal appears to be nothing more than a printed &s;tamp, for which a duty is paid to the crown: certainly it is not the &s;eal of the parties, or of either of them. But, as to the terms of the contract, the&s;e are indeed out of the u&s;ual cour&s;e, and de&s;erve con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>ONE of the rea&s;ons for allowing mariners to &s;ue in the admiralty is, that the debt ari&s;es from &s;ervices performed, or to be peformed at &s;ea, and a lien on the &s;hip given to them for their &s;ecu|rity, becau&s;e the contract they make is &s;uppo&s;ed to be on the credit of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>NOW, although the wages of twenty dollars per month, promi&s;ed in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, appear to be extravagant, yet, as the difficulty of getting a per|&s;on qualified to &s;erve both as a &s;kilful pilot and able mariner might have been great, I think the rate of wages per month ought to be allowed as con|tracted for. But I cannot, upon any principle, allow that a captain hath a power to bind his ow|ners and their ve&s;&s;el to the payment of a mariner's wages for three months after his di&s;charge, and af|ter all &s;ervices at &s;ea and el&s;ewhere have cea&s;ed.
<PB N="195" REF="024407_1000_0FC72A2446F0A450">
If he could legally do this for three months, why not for &s;ix or twelve; or even &s;addle his ow|ners with an annuity for life to a mariner for a few weeks actual &s;ervice? How far the common law might con&s;ider this contract as binding on the captain per&s;onally, it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ay; but as judge of admiralty, I &s;hall be far from doing my part towards e&s;tabli&s;hing a precedent by which captains, in addition to the great pow|er they nece&s;&s;arily have over the property of their employers, may have that of obliging them to the payment of unlimited &s;ums for an unlimited time. The captain might have engaged for his owners to pay wages per month during the &s;er|vice, or a &s;pecific &s;um for the run to any amount ju&s;tifiable by the circum&s;tances and nece&s;&s;ities of the ca&s;e; but to bind the owner to periodical payments to a mariner after a total di&s;charge from the &s;ervice, is what I believe no captain of a ve&s;|&s;el ever before attempted. For whether this was to be paid all at once, or at three &s;everal times, it matters not; the contract is for <HI>three months wa|ges after di&s;charge.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another claim under this contract for &s;ixty dollars to take the libellant back to Ha|vannah on being di&s;charged here.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="024407_1001_0FC72A254A51CCC8">THE maritime cu&s;tom is, that if a ma&s;ter or owner di&s;charges a mariner in a foreign port, be|fore the completion of the voyage for which he engaged, &s;ome rea&s;onable allowance &s;hall be made, over and above the wages due, to enable him to return to his own country, or go to the port, which by the articles, &s;hould have completed the voyage; and this allowance is u&s;ually the amount of one month's wages: and it is a rea&s;onable cu&s;tom, where the mariner is willing to perform articles and fini&s;h the voyage, but the ma&s;ter or owner thinks fit to di&s;charge him &s;ooner for their own convenience, and without ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t the mariner. Therefore this part of the contract before us is con&s;i&s;tent with maritime cu&s;tom, but certainly unrea&s;onable as to the &s;um promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHATEVER power a captain may have by law to bind his owners by contracts made abroad for the &s;ervices of the &s;hip, yet he cannot oblige them beyond what is u&s;ual and cu&s;tomary, without &s;hewing that the unu&s;ual charge, aro&s;e from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. The pre&s;ent charge is expre&s;s|ly made for conveying the libellant back to the Havannah: I have therefore enquired what is the u&s;ual charge for a pa&s;&s;age from the port to the
<PB N="197" REF="024407_1002_0FC72A26D2F6B898">
Havannah, and find that forty dollars is an ample and generous allowance.</P>
<P>FRAUD and collu&s;ion between the captain and Canizares the libellant, have been &s;ugge&s;ted, but not proved: yet if I had not found that this cau&s;e might and ought to be determined on general principles, there are two circum&s;tances in the ca&s;e which would have induced a more &s;trict enquiry into the captain's conduct. The one, which I have already noticed, is Cupi&s;ono's lending money on hypothecation without &s;ecurity, or even a&s;king for common intere&s;t, which, though a po&s;&s;ible, is not a u&s;ual occurrence. The other is a contract between the captain and Canizares, which concludes with the&s;e remarkable words&mdash;"Each (that is the original and copy) <HI>having the &s;ame &s;trength as if they had been executed before a notary public at Havannah.</HI>" The que&s;tion naturally oc|curs, and why was not this contract executed before a notary public at Havannah? An hone&s;t captain, who is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of binding his owners to hard and u&s;ual terms, would at lea&s;t take care that nothing &s;hould be wanting in point of form and public notoriety to ju&s;tify his conduct. And, be&s;ides, I &s;u&s;pect that this contract, which bears? printed &s;eal or &s;tamp, could not be legally execu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> according to the regulations of the ma|ritime

laws and cu&s;toms, but in the pre&s;ence of a notary or &s;ome public officer. But it was not nece&s;&s;ary to clear up the&s;e appearances, as the cau&s;e may be decided on other grounds.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I adjudge and decree, that Canizares, the libellant, have and receive from Juan Jo&s;eph de Aguire Perez, the re&s;pondent, the &s;um of 112 dollars and 60-90ths of a dollar, equal to &pound;. 42:5, Penn&s;ylvania currency: that is to &s;ay:

<P>THE ca&s;e was&mdash;The libellants engaged in the year 1782, with James Forbes, then captain of the &s;hip Dolphin, for a mercantile voyage from Phi|ladelphia to the Havannah, and back again; for which they were to receive, not monthly wages, but a &s;tipulated &s;um, to be paid them at the Ha|vannah. Whil&s;t the &s;hip was at Havannah, the Spani&s;h governor of Cuba had projected a military expedition again&s;t the i&s;land of New Providence, and offered con&s;iderable emoluments to &s;uch Ame|ricans in port as would enter their ve&s;&s;els in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice, for this expedition: viz. 10 dol|lars per ton for their ve&s;&s;els, and a gratuity of 700 dollars to each captain. Forbes, after paying his crew the &s;tipulated &s;um for the original voy|age, propo&s;ed to them this new expedition: an expedition not known, or thought of, at the time of the fir&s;t contract, and of a nature entirely differ|ent
<PB N="201" REF="024407_1006_0FC72A2D8BFCE8A0">
from the &s;ervice for which they &s;tood engaged to the &s;hip. The mariners declined this propo&s;al, unle&s;s informed what recompence they were to have for their time and hazard in this new &s;ervice. Whereupon Forbes a&s;&s;ured them of at lea&s;t 20 dollars per month to each man, and hinted further emoluments from the Spani&s;h government. Thus a&s;&s;ured, the mariners entered on the &s;ervice, and afterwards &s;ailed with the Spani&s;h fleet, and were pre&s;ent at, and a&s;&s;i&s;tant in, the &s;iege of New Pro|vidence.</P>
<P>THE only que&s;tion &s;eems to be, whether a con|tract expre&s;sly made &s;hall be fulfilled or not?</P>
<P>WHEN the Spani&s;h governor agreed to give 10 dollars per ton for American ve&s;&s;els, and a gratuity of 700 dollars to each captain, he certainly expect|ed that &s;uch ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be properly manned, and fitted for the &s;ervice. Captain Forbes know|ing this, and knowing al&s;o that the propo&s;ed &s;er|vice could not, by any con&s;truction, be con&s;idered as a part of the original voyage for which the ma|riners had contracted, enters upon a new treaty with them.

<P>THE libel in this cau&s;e &s;tates&mdash;That Charles Moran, the libellant, entered on board the &s;hip
<PB N="203" REF="024407_1008_0FC72A3227D03ED8">
l'Heureux, at Nantz, in France, on the 23d day of October, 1786, under an engagement for a voyage from the &s;aid port of Nantz to New Orleans, in the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; from thence to go to Martinique, and from thence to return to France: that Alexan|der Baudoin, the captain, had totally altered this voyage by repeated deviations, whereby the con|tract was broken, and thereupon the libellant prays a di&s;charge, and the amount of wages due.</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, appear by the te&s;timony, to be the&s;e:</P>
<P>THAT this ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed from Nantz, October 3d, 1786: that the marines under&s;tood, and were in|formed, that this voyage was to be from Nantz to New Orleans; thence to the We&s;t Indies, and thence back to Nantz, or to &s;ome port in France; and that it would continue from 10 to 15 or 16 months: that under this expectation, the mariners were regi&s;tered at the proper office at Nantz, ac|cording to the manner of regi&s;tering &s;eamen in France: that in&s;tead of pur&s;uing this voyage, as de&s;ignated to them, they were taken three times to New Orleans, twice to Martinique, once to Aux Cayes, once to Havannah, and were now brought to the port of Philadelphia: that in the cour&s;e of the&s;e &s;everal voyages, the libellant and others of
<PB N="204" REF="024407_1009_0FC72A338742B420">
the crew, made frequent complaints of the prolon|gation of, and deviations from, the originally in|tended voyage, and had applied to the intendants of &s;ome of the ports they were at, demanding to be di&s;charged, or taken back to France: but were detained in the &s;ervice of the &s;hip, by repeated a&s;&s;urances of the captain, that from the then next intended port they &s;hould &s;ail for France: that in particular, when they were at Martinique the &s;e|cond time, the whole crew complained and demand|ed their di&s;charge; whereupon the captain threw the boat&s;wain and another &s;ailor into pri&s;on: and that the boat&s;wain wrote to the commanding offi|cer of a frigate there, who &s;ent for him out of pri&s;on, and obliged the captain to pay him the wa|ges due, and di&s;charge him.</P>
<P>TO this libel and te&s;timony, the re&s;pondent hath urged in reply:</P>
<P>THAT no contract or articles between the cap|tain and the crew of this &s;hip have been exhibited: that the libel it&s;elf is deficient in form; and that let the deviations from the original voyage be what they may, the libellant hath for his part ju&s;tified the whole, by &s;igning a verbal proce&s;s on board the &s;hip, on the 30th of April la&s;t, certifying that the &s;hip l'Heureux had &s;uffered damage by &s;torm,
<PB N="205" REF="024407_1010_0FC72A3759034260">
and agreeing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the port of Philadelphia in di&s;tre&s;s, which verbal proce&s;s &s;o &s;igned, has been exhibited in this court.</P>
<P>AS there is no ordinance of the United States, or act of the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania touching the pre&s;ent object, the claim of the libellant, who is a French &s;ubject, and was &s;hipped in France, will be be&s;t determined by the marine ordinances of the country to which he belongs, and under which he engaged in the &s;ervice of this ve&s;&s;el. The&s;e ordinances &s;trictly prohibit any captain or ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el from receiving on board his &s;hip any mariner, as &s;uch, who is not entered in his rolle d'equipage made up in the commi&s;&s;ary's office, or bureau de cla&s;&s;es of the port where the ve&s;&s;el &s;hall be. See, Ord. de Mar. vol i. p. 422. and p. 715. Now as it has not been denied but that the libellant has &s;erved on board this &s;hip ever &s;ince &s;he &s;ailed from Nantz, it is in vain to call upon him for proof of the contract made at Nantz, &s;ince the rolle d'equipage, or a copy of it, is always in the captain's hands, and never in the mariner's. Had no &s;uch contract taken place as mentioned in the libel, or &s;hould the libellant demand larger wages than had been agreed upon, the captain would have &s;hewn the rolle d'equi|page again&s;t him. As he has not done this, al|though
<PB N="206" REF="024407_1011_0FC72A38C5B5F9A0">
in his power, it follows that the allegation of the libellant mu&s;t be admitted as true. Indeed it is in po&s;itive te&s;timony, that the libellant entered on board at Nantz, and was to receive fifty livers per month wages, which is &s;ufficient proof of a contract.</P>
<P>THE next point is to con&s;ider the repeated de|viations from the original voyage, and how far this &s;hould operate in relea&s;ing the mariner from his contract. To lay it down as a general rule, that the lea&s;t deviation from a de&s;ignated voyage &s;hould invalidate the articles and di&s;charge the ma|riners from the &s;hip's &s;ervice, would perhaps be con&s;truing tho&s;e articles too &s;trictly, and would cer|tainly be very injurious to commerce. Shipping articles ought not to be judged by the &s;ame rules with a policy of in&s;urance, or a common law con|tract, their object and ground of rea&s;on being quite different. Yet gro&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary devia|tions &s;hall free a mariner from his engagement. But there is no pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to fix a general rule. This cau&s;e mu&s;t be determined by po&s;itive law: and there is an ordinance of France expre&s;s to the purpo&s;e Mar. Ord. vol. I. p. 548. art. 4.&mdash; "If at any time after the arrival and di&s;charge of the ve&s;&s;el at the port of her de&s;tination, the cap|tain or ma&s;ter, in&s;tead of returning, &s;hall freight
<PB N="207" REF="024407_1012_0FC72A3C8D0344B0">
or load his &s;hip to go el&s;ewhere, the mariner may leave her if he choo&s;es, unle&s;s it has been otherwi&s;e determined by his &s;pecial agreement." And this rule is further inforced by Valin's com|mentary on the article.</P>
<P>THERE appears to me a &s;trong pre&s;umption that the the boat&s;wain, who was paid and di&s;char|ged at Martinique by order of the commander of a frigate there, claimed the benefit of this ordi|nance. It is &s;aid, indeeed, that his mother was dead, and that he had bu&s;ine&s;s in France; but this I think would hardly be admitted as a &s;uffici|ent rea&s;on to di&s;charge a mariner in the mid&s;t of a voyage. It is plain that Baudoin did not deem it &s;ufficient, for he put the man in pri&s;on for deman|ding his wages and di&s;charge.</P>
<P>THE objections to the libel in point of form are not &s;ufficient to invalidate the &s;uit. It is not indeed &s;o &s;pecific as might be wi&s;hed, but the &s;ub&s;tance of the complaint is alledged, viz. an engage|ment for a certain voyage, a total deviation from that voyage, and a citation prayed for, to &s;hew cau&s;e why the wages accrued &s;hould not be paid, and the libellant di&s;charged.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="024407_1013_0FC72A3E0981BF10">THE verbal proce&s;s &s;igned by the libellant on board the &s;hip, is the next circum&s;tance relied upon by the re&s;pondent. But this cannot have the operation expected. If the &s;hip was really in di&s;tre&s;s, there is no doubt but that any mariner would &s;ign his con&s;ent to put into a &s;trange port to avoid impending danger, and refit th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> damaged rigging. But this deviation occa&s;ioned by nece&s;|&s;ity cannot &s;erve as a ju&s;tification of former devia|tions where no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity occured.</P>
<P>I am clearly of opinion, that if this cau&s;e was tri|ed before a French court of ju&s;tice, the libellant could not be refu&s;ed the benefit of the mariners ordinance expre&s;sly in favour of his claim.</P>
<P>I adjudge that the libellant &s;hall have his wages, at the rate of fifty livers per month, from October 23d 1786; and that the re&s;pondent pay the co&s;ts of this &s;uit.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN THYBOUT ver&s;us ALEXANDER BAUDOIN.</HEAD>
<P>THYBOUT was a mariner belonging to the &s;ame &s;hip and under the &s;ame circum&s;tances with Charles Moran, libellant in the foregoing cau&s;e, but did not join in the libel with Moran; becau&s;e, as it was &s;aid, the captain kept him on board con|fined till the determination of that &s;uit &s;hould be known. But he now filed his complaint, claiming his wages and di&s;charge.</P>
<P>COUNCIL for the re&s;pondent, in addition to their arguments in the former cau&s;e, alledged that the la&s;t voyage from New Orleans, was authori&s;ed by government to procure &s;upplies for that city, which had ju&s;t then &s;uffered by a terrible fire; and &s;e|condly, that the libellant had made a new contract at New Orleans, and was entered accordingly on the rolle d'equipage there. In proof of the&s;e alle|gations,
<PB N="210" REF="024407_1015_0FC72A4A2FA8CE40">
copies and tran&s;lations of the &s;hip's pa|pers were offered in te&s;timony. But the libel|lant's council objected to the admi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e papers. Whereupon an argument was had on this previous que&s;tion. After con&s;ideration, the judge gave his opinion as follows.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion now before me is&mdash;Whether cer|tain papers, pre&s;ented to the court as copies and tran&s;lations of the manife&s;t, rolle d'equipage, &amp;c. of the &s;hip L'Heureux, re&s;pecting her la&s;t voyage from New Orleans, &s;hall be admitted as te&s;timony in the cau&s;e now in agitation, or not? And it is de|clared, that the de&s;ign in procuring the&s;e papers is to prove, fir&s;t, an authori&s;ed and nece&s;&s;ary devi|ation from the original voyage contracted for at Nantz; and, 2dly, a new engagement made by the libellant at New Orleans.</P>
<P>THE correctne&s;s of the&s;e copies, and the au|thenticity of the originals, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by the depo&s;ition of Mr. John Leamy; and the fidelity of the tran&s;lations are certified by the notarial &s;eals of &s;worn interpreters.</P>
<P>THE fidelity of the tran&s;lations is, I think, &s;uf|ficiently a&s;certained, becau&s;e the tran&s;lator is offi|cially known to the court, being commi&s;&s;ioned by,
<PB N="211" REF="024407_1016_0FC72A4E17F4BC78">
and an&s;werable to government for the due execu|tion of his tru&s;t. But it is not &s;o certain what evi|dence &s;hall be &s;ufficient to authenticate the in&s;tru|ments of officers of a foreign country, &s;o as to give them the force of legal te&s;timony in our courts. The authorities that have been cited all refer to ca&s;es, where the originals, the copies, and the certifying officers, were all within the realm of England, and therefore do not come up to the point in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>MR. Leamy's depo&s;ition as to the authenticity of the&s;e papers is founded on his belief only, and not on po&s;itive te&s;timony, as appears on his cro&s;s examination in the&s;e words:
<Q>The &s;aid deponent being cro&s;s-examined, &s;aith, that he does not per&s;onally know any of the per&s;ons who have &s;igned any of the original papers before men|tioned, nor did he ever &s;ee any of them write: and that he, the deponent, had no papers in his cu&s;tody with the hands and &s;eals of the above mentioned per&s;ons to them, to compare the &s;aid papers with, except the &s;ignature of the pre&s;ent governor, with which he did not compare them.</Q></P>
<P>BUT, &s;econdly, it is manife&s;t, that the&s;e papers were copied and tran&s;lated in this city, pending
<PB N="212" REF="024407_1017_0FC72A5A36182500">
this &s;uit, and within the cognizance of the court. Why then were not the originals exhibited, that the tran&s;lations might be made by the direction, and under the authority of the court, after having had the opportunity of in&s;pecting the&s;e originals, and judging of their authenticity? It has been at|tempted to &s;hew that this could not be done<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The captain &s;ailed from the port during the &s;uit, and took the original papers with him.</NOTE>. But as the court of admiralty is always open, and as the&s;e papers were in the city for at lea&s;t &s;ome days, there was time &s;ufficient to have them compared, copied, and tran&s;lated by authority. The court hath a right to the be&s;t te&s;timony that can be pro|cured with any rea&s;onable convenience; and as the originals of the&s;e papers were in the hands of the re&s;pondent's council, and they have not thought fit to file them as exhibits in the cau&s;e, I &s;hall not now admit the copies taken by their di|rection. I think &s;uch a precedent might have dan|gerous future con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE argument then proceeded on the merits, and nearly the &s;ame grounds were travelled over, which had been taken in Moran's ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="024407_1018_0FC72A61100AC408">AFTER advi&s;ement, judgment was given as follows:</P>
<P>JOHN Thybout, the pre&s;ent libellant, having &s;hipped at the &s;ame time, and under the &s;ame contract, with Charles Moran, who&s;e &s;uit was lately decided in this court, the te&s;timony exhibit|ed in Moran's ca&s;e has been applied to this.</P>
<P>THERE are only three new exhibits in the pre|&s;ent cau&s;e: viz. a prote&s;t made by captain Baudoin and his officers, &s;oon after his arrival at Phila|delphia, dated the 17th of May la&s;t, and two de|po&s;itions; one of William Matthi&eacute;, a pa&s;&s;enger on board the l'Heureux, and the other, a &s;econd de|po&s;ition of Ba&s;tian Gaudin, who had given te&s;timo|mony in the former cau&s;e. The purport of the prote&s;t is to &s;hew, that this &s;hip was driven by a N. N. E. &s;torm into the port of Philadelphia, in di&s;tre&s;s, and the tenor of the two depo&s;itions tends directly to contradict the a&s;&s;ertion of the prote&s;t.</P>
<P>FROM all that appears in te&s;timony, this ve&s;&s;el was bound from New Orleans to the port of Nantz in France: and Matthi&eacute;, the pa&s;&s;enger, received a pa&s;&s;port from the governor's &s;ecre|tary at New Orleans, to be admitted on board
<PB N="214" REF="024407_1019_0FC72A620D6A3C10">
as a pa&s;&s;enger to Nantz. How then it could po&s;&s;i|bly happen, that this, or any other ve&s;&s;el, being in the latitude of 25&deg; 3&prime; north, &s;hould be driven by a violent N. N. E. wind, to the latitude of 35&deg; 4&prime; north, where the verbal proce&s;s was made on board, is to me quite incomprehen&s;ible. But as I do not think the libellant's claim does at all depend upon the validity of either the verbal pro|ce&s;s, or the &s;ub&s;equent prote&s;t, I &s;hall ob&s;erve no further upon them.</P>
<P>IT is manife&s;t to me, that the libellant hath been detained in the &s;ervice of this &s;hip an unrea&s;onable length of time beyond the period of the voyage contracted for: that the original agreement made at Nantz, between the captain and his crew, has been violated and di&s;&s;olved by frequent unnece&s;&s;ary deviations: that the promi&s;es of the captain, at every deviation, to return immediately to France, have been repeatedly broken: and that, if this cau&s;e was tried before a French court, under the marine ordinances of that country, there is no doubt but that the libellant would recover his wa|ges, and obtain his di&s;charge.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no rea&s;on for di&s;tingui&s;hing this from Charles Mora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> ca&s;e: and therefore, I adjudge, that the libellant &s;hall have his wages, at the rate

<L>AS I &s;at by the fire, the new&s;paper read,</L>
<L>And waited for breakfa&s;t, my wife being in bed;</L>

<L>Than to call for &s;ome paper, and write you a letter.</L>
<L>'Tis true I have nothing material to &s;ay,</L>

<L>Our leaving <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and how we got hither,</L>
<L>Half tir'd to death, thro' wind and foul weather.</L>
<L>I mounted at nine, and &s;et off on my journey,</L>
<L>Along with my brother-in-law the attorney;</L>
<L>Who took with him papers, &s;o many and bulkly,</L>
<L>He found it convenient to ride in his &s;ulky.</L>
<L>We travell'd, and chatted, and made our&s;elves merry,</L>
<L>And who &s;hould we meet a few miles from the ferry,</L>
<L>But the <HI>great little man:</HI> the ju&s;tice I mean,</L>
<L>Rever'd and belov'd by the &s;wains of <HI>Chri&s;teen.</HI></L>
<L>You know that at pre&s;ent, however, he labours</L>
<L>Beneath a &s;ad quarrel with one of his neighbours;</L>

<L>What homage the vulgar to ju&s;tices owe.</L>
<L>He &s;topp'd us, and while we &s;tood &s;till in our places&punc;</L>
<L>Related his &s;tory, and cited &s;ome ca&s;es,</L>

<L>Till we came to the ferryman's hou&s;e on the &s;hore.</L>
<L>Now this ferryman happen'd to be the vile brute</L>
<L>Who affronted his wor&s;hip, and rais'd this di&s;pute:</L>
<L>He likewi&s;e related his ca&s;e to the lawyer</L>
<L>In &s;uch agitation, he work'd like a &s;awyer;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t I &s;tood impatient, unable to &s;tir,</L>

<L>At length I exclaim'd&mdash;as I am a &s;inner,</L>
<L>We've no time to lo&s;e, we &s;hall mi&s;s of our dinner:</L>

<L>LONG, lank and lead, my CADAVERA &s;tood,</L>
<L>Like the tall pine, the glory of the wood&mdash;</L>
<L>Oft times I gaz'd, with learned &s;kill to tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce</L>
<L>The &s;harp edg'd beauties of her bony face&mdash;</L>
<L>There ro&s;e <HI>Os frontis</HI> prominent and bold,</L>
<L>In deep &s;unk <HI>orbits</HI> two large eye-balls roll'd,</L>
<L>Beneath tho&s;e eye-balls, two arch'd bones were &s;een</L>
<L>Whereon two flabby cheeks hung loo&s;e and lean;</L>
<L>Between tho&s;e cheeks, protuberant aro&s;e,</L>
<L>In form triangular, her lovely no&s;e,</L>
<L>Like EGYPT's pyramid it &s;eem'd to ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Scorn earth, and bid defiance to the &s;kies;</L>
<L>Thin were her lips, and of a &s;allow hue,</L>
<L>Her open mouth expos'd her teeth to view;</L>
<L>Projecting &s;trong, protuberant and wide</L>
<L>Stood <HI>inci&s;ores</HI>&mdash;and on either &s;ide</L>
<L>The <HI>canine</HI> rang'd, with many a beauteous flaw,</L>
<L>And la&s;t the <HI>grinders,</HI> to fill up the jaw&mdash;</L>
<L>All in their <HI>alveoli</HI> fix'd &s;ecure,</L>
<L>Articulated by <HI>gompho&s;is</HI> &s;ure.</L>
<L>Around her mouth, perpetual &s;miles had made</L>
<L>Wrinkles wherein the loves and graces play'd;</L>
<L>There, &s;tretch'd and rigid by continual &s;train,</L>
<L>Appear'd the <HI>zygomatic</HI> mu&s;cles plain,</L>
<L><PB N="200" REF="024407_1219_0FC7228B5BA86DD8">And broad <HI>montanus</HI> o'er her peeked chin</L>
<L>Extended to &s;upport the heav'nly grin.</L>
<L>In amorous dalliance of I &s;troak'd her arm,</L>
<L>Each ri&s;ing mu&s;cle was a ri&s;ing charm.</L>
<L>O'er the <HI>flexores</HI> my fond fingers play'd,</L>
<L>I found in&s;truction with delight convey'd&mdash;</L>
<L>There <HI>carpus, cubitus</HI> and <HI>radius</HI> too</L>
<L>Were plainly felt and manife&s;t to view.</L>
<L>No mu&s;cles on her lovely hand were &s;een,</L>
<L>But only bones envelop'd by a &s;kin.</L>
<L>Long were her fingers and her knuckles bare,</L>
<L>Much like the claw-foot of a walnut chair.</L>
<L>So plain was complex <HI>metacarpus</HI> &s;hewn</L>
<L>It might be fairly counted bone by bone.</L>
<L>Her &s;lender <HI>phalanxes</HI> were well defin'd,</L>
<L>And each with each by <HI>ginglymus</HI> combin'd.</L>
<L>Such were the charms that did my fancy fire</L>
<L>And love&mdash;cha&s;te &s;cientific love in&s;pire.</L>

<L>AT length my CADAVERA fell beneath</L>
<L>The fatal &s;troke of all &s;ubduing death&mdash;</L>
<L>Three days in grief&mdash;three nights in tears I &s;pent,</L>
<L>And &s;ighs ince&s;&s;ant gave my &s;orrows vent.</L>

<L>FEW are th' examples of a love &s;o true&mdash;</L>
<L>Ev'n from her death I con&s;olation drew,</L>

<L>Re&s;olv'd her precious cor&s;e from worms to &s;ave;</L>
<L>With active ha&s;te remov'd the incumbent clay,</L>
