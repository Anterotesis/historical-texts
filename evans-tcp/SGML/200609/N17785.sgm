<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST every page of the &s;tory of Rome, exhibits a tragedy, without the exaggeration of poetic fiction; yet there are few of its intere&s;ting &s;cenes, that have not furni&s;hed the machinery for &s;ome dramatic work. But, amid&s;t the innumer|able writers, that almo&s;t every age has produced, the author of a piece, now offered the public, does not recollect to have &s;een the weakne&s;s and cruelty of <HI>Valentinian</HI>&mdash;the character of <HI>Petronius Maximus</HI>&mdash;the re&s;entment, indi&s;cretion and re|venge of <HI>Edoxia</HI>&mdash;(the more immediate cau&s;es of the inva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the imperial city, by the Vandals)&mdash;cho&s;en for the &s;ubject of theatrical in&s;truction.</P>
<P>The &s;ubver&s;ion of the we&s;tern empire, and the Sack of the city of Rome, by <HI>Gen&s;eric,</HI> form an era in the revolution of human affairs, that &s;trikes the mind with peculiar &s;olemnity: Perhaps, at that period, the character of man was &s;unk to the lowe&s;t &s;tage of depravity. Debilitated by the habits of every &s;pecies of luxury, a long &s;eries of tragical events, and the con|tinual apprehen&s;ions of pro&s;cription, or death; the powers of
<PB N="10" REF="023035_0009_0FBAE11169AD8E40">
the mind were, at the &s;ame time, ob&s;cured by the &s;uper&s;titions of weak, uninformed chri&s;tians, blended with the barbari&s;ic and ignorance of the darker ages.</P>
<P>Thus an impenetrable clo&s;ed was thrown over the religious and political in&s;titutions, both of the Roman and the Gothic world; which ha&s;tened on the de&s;truction of the former, with|out exhibiting any thing more honourable to the genius and vir|tue of mankind, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the latter; nor have more enlightened and poli&s;hed ages been taught, by their ex|amples, to &s;hun the luxurious vices, or the ab&s;urd &s;y&s;tems of policy, which have frequently corrupted, di&s;tracted, and ru|ined the be&s;t con&s;tituted republics; as well as divided and overturned the &s;trong fabric of monarchic government.</P>
<P>In tracing the ri&s;e, the character, the revolutions, and the full of the mo&s;t politic and brave, the mo&s;t in&s;olent and &s;elfi&s;h people, the world ever exhibited, the hero and the morali&s;t may find the mo&s;t &s;ublime examples of valour and virtue; and the philo&s;opher the mo&s;t humiliating le&s;&s;ons to the pride of man, in the turpitude of &s;ome of their capital characters: While the exten&s;ive dominions of that once celebrated nation, their haugh|ty
<PB N="11" REF="023035_0010_0FBAE1130E415678">
u&s;urpations and &s;plendid crimes, have for ages furni&s;hed the hi&s;torian and the poet with a field of &s;peculation, adapted to his own peculiar talents. But if the writer of the <HI>Sack of Rome</HI> has mi&s;taken her's, &s;he will, doubtle&s;s, be forgiven, as there have been in&s;tances of men of the be&s;t abilities who have fallen into the &s;ame error.</P>
<P>There is but little mixture of fable in the narration, and, I hope, a ju&s;t purity of &s;tile has been ob&s;erved, while the writer has aimed at moral improvement, by an exhibition of the tu|mult and mi&s;ery into which mankind are often plunged by an unwarrantable indulgence of the di&s;cordant pa&s;&s;ions of the hu|man mind.</P>
<P>Theatrical amu&s;ements may, &s;ometimes, have been pro&s;tituted to the purpo&s;es of vice; yet, in an age of ta&s;te and refinement, le&s;&s;ons of morality, and the con&s;equences of deviation, may per|haps, be as &s;ucce&s;sfully enforced from the &s;tage, as by modes of in&s;truction, le&s;s cen&s;ured by the &s;evere; while, at the &s;ame time, the exhibition of great hi&s;torical events, opens a field of contemplation to the reflecting and philo&s;ophic mind.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023035_0011_0FBAE11466701E50">My fir&s;t wi&s;h is to throw a mite into the &s;cale of virtue, and my highe&s;t ambition to meet the approbation of the judi|cious and worthy:&mdash;In the one, I am gratified from the re|flections of my own heart; for the other, I wait with diffi|dence the determinations of the candid public.</P>

<P>THE hi&s;tory of Charles the fifth, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y|ranny of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the exertions of the Spani&s;h Cortes, will ever be intere&s;ting to an American ear, &s;o long as they triumph in their independence, pride them&s;elves in the principles that in&s;tigated their patriots, and glory in the characters of their heroes, who&s;e valour completed a revolution that will be the wonder of ages.</P>
<P>WHAT a field for genius! What a di&s;|play of capacity, both in &s;cience, in bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and in politics, does this revolution ex|hibit! Certainly, enough to fire the ambi|tion, and light up every noble &s;park in the bo&s;om of tho&s;e who are in the morning of life.</P>

<P>PERHAPS the &s;ubject I have cho&s;en for the machinery of a tragedy, may be more proper for an epic, than a dramatic poem; yet I hope it will be acceptable in its pre&s;|ent garb, and that the candor of the public will be exerci&s;ed, not &s;o much for the &s;ake of the &s;ex, as the de&s;ign of the writer, who wi&s;hes only to cultivate the &s;entiments of public and private virtue in what&s;oever falls from her pen.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Who, on the American Determination, in <HI>1774,</HI> to &s;u&s;pend all Commerce with Britain, (except for the real Nece&s;&s;aries of life) reque&s;ted a poetical Li&s;t of the Articles the Ladies might compri&s;e under that Head.</P>

<L>And &s;tubborn patriots either frown, or rail;</L>
<L>Let them of grave economy talk loud,</L>
<L>Prate prudent mea&s;ures to the li&s;t'ning crowd;</L>

<L>The &s;tate may totter on proud ruin's brink,</L>
<L>The &s;word be brandi&s;h'd, or the bark may &s;ink;</L>
<L>Yet &s;hall Clari&s;&s;a check her wanton pride,</L>
<L>And lay her female ornaments a&s;ide?</L>
<L>Quit all the &s;hining pomp, the gay parade,</L>

<L>"Tis true, we love the courtly mein and air,</L>

<L>Who nobly &s;truggle in a vicious age,</L>
