<HEAD>REV. MR. <HI>WEST</HI>'S SERMON, AT HIS INSTALMENT.</HEAD>
<P>_CHRISTIANITY is the method devi&s;ed by infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s to effect the &s;alvation and hap|pine&s;s of fallen man. The execution of this gracious plan is committed to JESUS CHRIST the Son of GOD; who, as he fulfilled his Mini&s;try on earth, rai&s;ed up and commi&s;&s;ioned cho&s;|en men, whom he named Apo&s;tles, to com|plete the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his &s;piritual kingdom here below, and the &s;acred vol|ume agreeable to which it is to be govern|ed. Which being accompli&s;hed, the Min|i&s;ters of CHRIST receive their authority
<PB N="4" REF="022275_0003_0FB7ACC1588A8C08">
from him indeed, but in the way of his common providence, and under the gener|al direction of his SPIRIT. How men are inve&s;ted with that office&mdash;the difficulties which attend it&mdash;and the motives which &s;hould engage them to diligence and per|&s;everance in it, will form the &s;ubject of the following di&s;cour&s;e, founded on tho&s;e words:
<Q><BIBL>II. CORINTHIANS, iv.1.</BIBL>
<P>THEREFORE, SEEING WE HAVE THIS MINISTRY, AS WE HAVE RECEIVED MERCY, WE FAINT NOT.</P></Q></P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle concludes the preceding chapter with repre&s;enting the great effect of Chri&s;tianity, as producing the image of GOD in the hearts of men; from whence he infers the dignity and importance of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try. <HI>Therefore, &s;eeing we have,</HI> &amp;c. That is, Since the great de&s;ign and effect of the Go&s;pel is to re&s;tore de|praved human nature to the lo&s;t image, forfeited favour and enjoyment of GOD, how intere&s;ting and important is the Min|i&s;try of CHRIST! And as it has plea&s;ed him in his di&s;tingui&s;hing mercy, to inve&s;t us with, and to &s;upport us in that office, &s;o, under all the difficulties which we meet with, far from being di&s;couraged, we pur|&s;ue
<PB N="5" REF="022275_0004_0FB7ACC4019A2BE8">
it, with a zeal and re&s;olution propor|tioned to the greatne&s;s of its object, the glory of CHRIST, and the &s;alvation of the &s;ouls of men.</P>
<P>IT would be arrogance in the ordinary Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel to a&s;&s;ume the &s;tile of the Apo&s;tles, or apply to them&s;elves what was only intended of tho&s;e primitive and in&s;pired Preachers of Chri&s;tianity. But, as the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST in every age derive their authority from him, as they are engaged in the &s;ame cau&s;e, &s;erve the &s;ame Divine Ma&s;ter, from who&s;e gracious hand they expect their final reward; &s;o the &s;ame grateful ardour becomes them, and the &s;ame animating motives &s;hould excite their zeal and diligence, in pur&s;uing the great ends of their Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>AS GOD originally produced the grand &s;y&s;tem of nature by an immediate exerci&s;e of his almighty power; but, when pro|duced, governs it in the cour&s;e of his com|mon providence, agreeable to certain &s;tated laws: So, when by the miraculous exerci&s;e of the &s;ame almighty power, he had intro|duced and e&s;tabli&s;hed his &s;piritual kingdom among men, he left it to be governed by the &s;ame univer&s;al providence, under the direction of his SPIRIT, and agreeable to the dictates of his holy word.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="022275_0005_0FB7ACC6330D84E0">JESUS CHRIST admini&s;ters the govern|ment of providence. He is in particular that King whom GOD hath anointed upon his holy hill of Sion, and who is therefore head over all things to his Church. JESUS CHRIST rai&s;es up and qualifies &s;ome for the work of the Mini&s;try, by be&s;towing upon them tho&s;e natural and intellectual talents, a competent &s;hare of which is evidently nece&s;&s;ary to the purpo&s;e. For whil&s;t we readily acknowledge on the one hand, that the mo&s;t &s;hining talents are not e&s;&s;ential to the work of the Mini&s;try, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed on the other, agreeable to the mind of CHRIST, that per&s;ons &s;hould be appointed to that office to whom he has denied the abilities nece&s;&s;ary to the proper di&s;charge of the common affairs of life. If &s;hining talents are not indi&s;pen&s;able, they are at lea&s;t ornamental to the Mini&s;try and u&s;eful to the Church.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame all di&s;po&s;ing Providence fa|vours &s;ome with advantages for acquiring &s;uch degrees of learning as are, if not e&s;|&s;ential, greatly conducive to the ends of the Mini&s;try. An acquaintance with &s;ci|ence has a happy effect on the characters of men: It enlarges the mind, &s;oftens the manners, and furni&s;hes with a variety, both of &s;entiment and language, for the in&s;truc|tion of others. Learning is not, by any
<PB N="7" REF="022275_0006_0FB7ACCB18CEFB90">
means, to be &s;et in competition with an experimental acquaintance with true re|ligion. Nor do we pretend that it nece&s;|&s;arily tends to render men pious or virtu|ous. Like all other temporal advantages it is very liable to be abu&s;ed as the occa|&s;ion of pride and &s;elf &s;ufficiency; and is, perhaps, as often perverted in this manner as any di&s;tinction which one man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es above another. But when con&s;ecrated by divine grace to the honour and &s;ervice of CHRIST, it becomes not only an ornament to the office, but tends to the accompli&s;h|ment of its great de&s;ign; and is a qualifi|cation nearly indi&s;pen&s;able, in tho&s;e who are &s;et for the defence of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>BUT CHRIST de&s;ignates or points out &s;ome for the work of the Mini&s;try in a more direct way, by the effectual teachings of his HOLY SPIRIT; leading them into an acquaintance with the my&s;teries of the kingdom of heaven; enabling them to re|alize the truth of his doctrines, the excel|lency of his character, the beauties of ho|line&s;s, and the grandeur of tho&s;e pro&s;pects which are opened, through him, into the eternal world.</P>
<P>WHATEVER natural talents a man may po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;whatever learning he may have acquired, we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the
<PB N="8" REF="022275_0007_0FB7ACCC95E2FF30">
effectual teachings of the ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT of GOD, or that &s;piritual di&s;cernment which di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;piritual things, is nece&s;&s;ary to the work of the Mini&s;try; and that it cannot be the mind of the great Head of the Church, that men &s;hould be appointed to that office, who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion has not thus (if you will indulge the expre&s;&s;ion) been &s;ealed with his own hand; that is, who are not partakers of his &s;pirit and a|dorned with his image. Is that man prop|erly qualified to urge others to accept of CHRIST, who has not him&s;elf accepted him? Will he be likely to recommend the Go&s;|pel to others, who has not embraced it him&s;elf?&mdash;Will he be a good &s;oldier of JESUS CHRIST, who has never given his al|legiance to that Divine Ma&s;ter?&mdash;Will he pur&s;ue his Mini&s;try with proper zeal and per&s;everance, through all the difficulties with which it is attended, who has no &s;en&s;e of the excellency of the Go&s;pel, or the worth of &s;ouls, and is a &s;tranger to tho&s;e hopes which &s;hould warm the heart and animate the &s;ervices of the Mini&s;ter of CHRIST?&mdash;In a word, is he qualified to take care of and watch for the &s;ouls of oth|ers, who has neglected his own &s;oul?&mdash; You will readily acknowledge the ab&s;urdi|ty of the above &s;uppo&s;itions, and of con&s;e|quence, how nece&s;&s;ary it is, that the Min|i&s;ters
<PB N="9" REF="022275_0008_0FB7ACCE152B9228">
of CHRIST &s;hould be partakers of the &s;pirit of CHRIST.</P>
<P>BUT we do not &s;uppo&s;e, that a man's po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the above qualifications, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive manner, implies that he is under any obligation to engage in the work of the Mini&s;try. There ought to be a partic|ular inclination of the heart to it, attended with a per&s;ua&s;ion of the mind, that GOD requires it of him, and that, of con&s;equence, it is his duty thus to &s;erve the LORD CHRIST. When the above mentioned particulars meet with the acceptance and approbation of the Church and People of GOD, there is an evident de&s;ignation to office, and &s;uch men are called of GOD, as really, though in a different way, as tho&s;e primitive preach|ers, whom he pointed out by the miracu|lous gifts of his HOLY SPIRIT.</P>
<P>WE do not con&s;ider the mini&s;terial office as nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;umed for life; many cir|cum&s;tances may concur to render a contin|uance in it improper, and even impracti|cable. The &s;ame leading Providence which has pointed out the expediency of taking it up, may, with equal evidence, convince us that it is proper to relinqui&s;h it.</P>
<P>AS the work of the Mini&s;try is import|ant, &s;o, like mo&s;t other intere&s;ting pur&s;uits, it is attended with many difficulties and
<PB N="10" REF="022275_0009_0FB7ACD3D92D5FA0">
di&s;couragements. It affords but little pro&s;|pect of worldly advantage, le&s;s than either of the other learned profe&s;&s;ions, whil&s;t the &s;ervice which it requires is equal, or, per|haps, greater. And as for the plea&s;ures and honours of &s;cience, the man who faith|fully attends to his duty, as a Mini&s;ter of CHRIST, will find but little lei&s;ure to in|dulge in curious learned di&s;qui&s;itions; or, if he does &s;o, there is great rea&s;on to fear, it mu&s;t be at the expen&s;e of, what is infi|nitely more important, a proper attention to the duties of his office and the &s;alvation of &s;ouls. That man makes a wretched ex|change, who forfeits the favour of his Di|vine Ma&s;ter and endangers the &s;ouls of men, for the &s;ake of enjoying the plea&s;ures of learning or obtaining the honours of a literary character.</P>
<P>THE good Mini&s;ter will find much di&s;|couragement from the imperfections of his own heart: His office renders it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be much engaged in the ex|erci&s;es of piety and in religious conver&s;a|tion; but alas! how difficult does he find it, always to keep alive that &s;pirit of relig|ion, without which, the exerci&s;es of piety and religious conver&s;ation, become a pain|ful, in&s;tead of a plea&s;ing &s;ervice. He wi&s;h|es to exemplify in his own temper and con|duct, that religion which he preaches to
<PB N="11" REF="022275_0010_0FB7ACD59B643118">
others; but upon trial he finds, with pain|ful regret, that, in many in&s;tances, this is impracticable. He is obliged to plead the &s;incerity of his intentions, to excu&s;e the de|ficiencies of his conduct with men; whil&s;t, with re&s;pect to his Maker, he con&s;iders the &s;acrifice of JESUS as the ground of his own as well as his people's hope of pardon, &s;al|vation and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is much di&s;couragement ari&s;ing to the faithful Mini&s;ter of CHRIST, from the froward humours of mankind. He is often cen&s;ured where he ought to have met with commendation&mdash;and di&s;charging the mo&s;t difficult office of friend&s;hip, reprov|ing the faults of men, though done with exqui&s;ite caution, will often forfeit their friend&s;hip, and convert it to the cruele&s;t hatred. Tho&s;e in who&s;e &s;ervice he has la|boured with the mo&s;t painful a&s;&s;iduity, will, when unrea&s;onably offended, reward him with the mo&s;t bitter reproaches. He frequently finds rea&s;on to adopt the com|plaint of his Divine Ma&s;ter, that he has <HI>laboured in vain, and &s;pent his &s;trength for naught and in vain.</HI> To which we may add the awful apprehen&s;ion of bringing on him&s;elf the blood of &s;ouls who may peri&s;h through his neglect. The&s;e are &s;ome of the di&s;couragements which attend the work of the Mini&s;try. They are formidable in|deed;
<PB N="12" REF="022275_0011_0FB7ACD71487EF88">
but the faithful Mini&s;ters of CHRIST may notwith&s;tanding adopt the language of the text, <HI>we faint not.</HI> The &s;ame mercy of GOD which has honoured us, putting us into that office and has hitherto &s;up|ported, will &s;till &s;upport us whil&s;t we con|tinue faithful to him.</P>
<P>THERE are many con&s;iderations to en|courage the heart and animate the labours of the faithful Mini&s;ter. He is engaged in a &s;ervice which claims the attention of all holy and good beings, whether on earth or in heaven. He is a worker together with GOD, and &s;o long as he &s;tudies to &s;hew him&s;elf approved unto GOD, he is &s;ure of his gracious pre&s;ence. His office, to &s;peak mode&s;tly of it, is of great importance to mankind, and has therefore been held in high repute by the wi&s;e and the good of every age. It is an office well adapted to gratify the benevolent affections of the hu|man heart. The very de&s;ign of it is the happine&s;s of mankind&mdash;to &s;econd the views of the compa&s;&s;ionate SAVIOUR of the world &mdash;to &s;ave tho&s;e who are lo&s;t&mdash;to open the pri&s;on doors to tho&s;e who are bound&mdash;to relea&s;e the captive from his chains&mdash;to comfort the mourner and to heal the broken heart&mdash;to in&s;truct the ignorant&mdash;reclaim the wanderer to the paths of virtue&mdash;and encourage the di&s;ciples of JESUS in their
<PB N="13" REF="022275_0012_0FB7ACDCC1F1C5B0">
fidelity to him and per&s;everance in his &s;er|vice.&mdash;Plea&s;ing office! where the heart is engaged in it, and where &s;ucce&s;s attends our labours, and we are in&s;trumental, in the hands of CHRIST, in promoting the &s;alvation and happine&s;s of the &s;ouls of men. We &s;erve a gracious Ma&s;ter, who is as willing as he is able to afford us every needed &s;upport, and who&s;e addre&s;s to us is the &s;ame which &s;ilenced the fears of the Apo&s;tle Paul, <HI>My grace is &s;ufficient for you.</HI> We act always under his eye; a pow|erful motive to exertion, as we are &s;ure no in&s;tance of it, however incon&s;iderable in it&s;elf, or unknown to the world, will pa&s;s unnoticed or unrewarded by him. We act with a view to eternity, and in pro&s;|pect of the rewards of our fidelity and zeal at the end of our warfare, when <HI>they who have turned many unto righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, and as the &s;tars forever and ever.</HI> How well adapted are &s;uch views as the&s;e to lighten every burden, to reconcile us to every trial, and to call forth every exertion? Who would not cheerfully &s;pend and be &s;pent for &s;uch a Ma&s;ter and in &s;uch a &s;ervice? Ble&s;&s;ed JE|SUS, our faith looks to thee, through the vale of death, and anticipates the all im|portant moment when we &s;hall hear from thy gracious lips, <HI>Well done good and faith|ful &s;ervants, enter ye into the joys of your LORD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="022275_0013_0FB7ACDDD9588680">WE infer, from what has been &s;aid, that the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel is a painful and laborious &s;ervice; that it is ill &s;uited to the indulgence of &s;loth and di&s;&s;ipation. <HI>Much &s;tudy is a wearine&s;s to the fle&s;h</HI>: The &s;olicitude which the good Mini&s;ter feels for the proper di&s;charge of his duty, and the &s;ucce&s;s of his Mini&s;try, is much more painful. His hands and his heart will be con&s;tantly employed, and the affectionate manner in which he pur&s;ues his Mini&s;try in private, will di&s;cover it&s;elf in the warmth of his publick addre&s;&s;es; and one &s;pirit of rational, con&s;i&s;tent and animated zeal will give life and ornament to every duty.</P>
<P>I ADDRESS my&s;elf, with great affection, to the Church and Society who have, with &s;uch unanimity, invited me to the pa&s;toral office among them, and to who&s;e &s;ervice I am this day con&s;ecrating my&s;elf in a pub|lick manner.</P>
<P>MEN AND BRETHREN,</P>
<P>THE Mini&s;ter of CHRIST is the &s;ervant of his Church, and his labours, as to time and place, ought to be regulated by the pro&s;pect of doing good, or promoting the intere&s;ts of religion. But when by mutu|al agreement, a relation is formed between him and a particular people, it becomes exceeding near and intere&s;ting; their hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="15" REF="022275_0014_0FB7ACDF8B24EF90">
is clo&s;ely connected. The relation ought never to be di&s;&s;olved but upon the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;it never can be di&s;|&s;olved but with the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;a|tions. Friend&s;hip is balm to a pained heart&mdash;The affectionate manner in which you have received me, the kind attention with which you have treated me, are ex|ceedingly &s;oothing, and afford the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and flattering pro&s;pect. But you will allow me to ob&s;erve, that it is your conduct towards our Divine Ma&s;ter, for which I ought to be principally concerned. Would you give me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, it mu&s;t be by a &s;erious attention to the in|&s;titutions of religion, and practice of its duties. I expect, indeed, as I &s;tand in need of your candour towards me, that you will not lightly admit a prejudice again&s;t me, and that you will give me the fir&s;t op|portunity of explaining for my&s;elf, what|ever may need explanation, either in my preaching or conduct. I was going to a&s;k your prayers&mdash;but I am &s;ure you will not cea&s;e to pray for the &s;ucce&s;s of my Mini&s;|try, with which your own and your chil|dren's happine&s;s is &s;o nearly connected.&mdash; This much depends upon the countenance and encouragement which I &s;hall receive from the principal members of the &s;ociety, who, I am per&s;uaded, will not fail to &s;ec|ond
<PB N="16" REF="022275_0015_0FB7ACE3AF801478">
my endeavours to promote the cau&s;e of piety and virtue among us. May the GOD of peace dwell with us&mdash;his glory be advanced by us&mdash;and his ble&s;&s;ing re&s;t up|on us.</P>
<P>I CANNOT omit this opportunity of paying my grateful acknowledgments to the inhabitants of the town in general, and to my brethren in the Mini&s;try in par|ticular, for the very obliging manner in which they have received me, and the kind attention which they have paid to me, &s;ince I have been among them.&mdash;With re&s;pect to my brethren in the Mini&s;try, I can with great propriety adopt the words of St. Paul, <HI>The&s;e are my fellow workers to the kingdom of GOD, who have been a comfort unto me.</HI> I greatly rejoice in that &s;pirit of candour which at pre&s;ent prevails between Mini&s;|ters of different denominations: May it more and more prevail, that, united by that <HI>charity which is the bond of perfectne&s;s,</HI> in|&s;tead of dividing upon circum&s;tantials, we may u&s;e our joint endeavours for promot|ing the great e&s;&s;entials of our holy religion.</P>
<P>I PROMISE my&s;elf great plea&s;ure and ad|vantage from my connexion with per&s;ons of &s;uch amiable characters. May we en|courage each other in the &s;ervice of our common Ma&s;ter, and long know <HI>how good
<PB N="17" REF="022275_0016_0FB7ACE556E40410">
and how plea&s;ant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.</HI></P>
<P>LASTLY,</P>
<P>I ADDRESS my&s;elf in a few pathetick words to this great and very re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly.&mdash;If an heathen monarch, as an|cient hi&s;tory informs us, once wept over a numerous concour&s;e of his fellow crea|tures, on reflecting that they mu&s;t &s;oon become the prey of death, how much more does this tear of tenderne&s;s become the eye of one, who is profe&s;&s;edly the Mini&s;ter of the GOD of mercy and the compa&s;&s;ionate SAVIOUR of the world.</P>
<P>IT is to that SAVIOUR I would now direct your views; <HI>Behold the LAMB of GOD, which taketh away the &s;in of the world.</HI> Are you de&s;irous of obtaining happine&s;s? Yes, for what child of Adam is not? In JESUS CHRIST all fulne&s;s dwells: He is that <HI>wi&s;dom, which is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth her; who&s;e ways are plea&s;antne&s;s and all who&s;e paths are peace.</HI> JESUS CHRIST can and will &s;up|ply every real want, and &s;atisfy every rea|&s;onable de&s;ire. But where &s;hall we find, and how &s;hall we &s;ecure an intere&s;t in this ine&s;timable friend? Attend to his addre&s;s; <HI>Behold I &s;tand at the door and knock: If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will
<PB N="18" REF="022275_0017_0FB7ACE6D46FE348">
come in to him, and will &s;up with him, and he with me.</HI> You will ea&s;ily recollect, that from your earlie&s;t remembrance, CHRIST has been urging this admi&s;&s;ion to your hearts; or, which is the &s;ame thing, he has by a gentle, but powerful influence, been pointing you to religion as the only means of happine&s;s; &s;aying, <HI>This is the way, walk ye in it.</HI> Admit him then into your hearts, make him the ground of your tru&s;t, the object of your affections, and he will be the &s;ource of your joys; <HI>the peace of GOD which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding &s;hall keep your hearts and minds through CHRIST JESUS.</HI></P>
<P>THE kingdom of CHRIST <HI>is an everla&s;t|ing kingdom, and his dominion ruleth over all.</HI> His &s;ubjects are partakers with him in the glory and happine&s;s of his reign. <HI>Lift up your heads</HI> therefore <HI>and rejoice,</HI> ye &s;ervants of CHRIST, <HI>for your redemption draweth nigh. Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy com|eth in the morning. You &s;hall return and come, with &s;inging, unto Sion, and ever|la&s;ting joy &s;hall be upon your heads.

<HEAD>THE CHARGE, GIVEN TO THE REV. MR. <HI>WEST,</HI> BY THE REV. MR. <HI>BELKNAP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO form the character of a Mini&s;|ter of JESUS CHRIST, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he be fir&s;t qualified, with gifts and graces, proper for the di&s;charge of his office, and then that he be regularly called to exerci&s;e them.</P>
<P>CHURCHES have a right to elect their own Pa&s;tors; but before they exerci&s;e this right, it becomes them, impartially and devoutly, to look into the word of GOD, to &s;ee what qualifications are required in a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter; and then charitably to judge, whether the per&s;on whom they are de&s;ir|ous of appointing to this office, be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e qualifications; if they find a cor|re&s;pondence between the marks there laid down, and the character which he exhib|its, they have a &s;ufficient warrant to call him to officiate; becau&s;e they may on good grounds be &s;atisfied that the HOLY GHOST has fitted him to be an Over&s;eer of the Church of GOD.</P>

As far as Ordination, in the primitive times, was the conferring a gift or ability to ex|erci&s;e powers peculiar to the &s;tate of the Church in that age, we have nothing to do with it; but as far as it is the de&s;ignation or appointment of a qualified per&s;on to the office of teaching and ruling in the Church of GOD, according to his word, there is nothing my&s;terious in it. The concurrence of neighbouring Mini&s;ters and Churches in the publick inve&s;titure is but an act of communion and a te&s;timony of their broth|erly love.</P>
<P>IF the Apo&s;tles were endowed with ex|traordinary powers, tho&s;e powers have cea&s;ed with their per&s;onal Mini&s;try. We know of no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to them in their a|po&s;tolick character, nor do we conceive that there is the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, while they them&s;elves are pre&s;ent with us for all the purpo&s;es of chri&s;tian edification, in their valuable writings. From them we learn the characters and duties of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters: By them Churches are to govern them&s;elves in their choice, and Mini&s;ters in the exerci&s;e of their gifts: By an appeal to them we may regulate all our proceedings; and the nearer we conform
<PB N="21" REF="022275_0020_0FB7ACEFD83B0C78">
to the &s;implicity, the better &s;hall we pre|&s;erve the purity of divine in&s;titutions. Let the Apo&s;tles then be heard &s;peaking in the name of their Ma&s;ter and of ours; and let no a&s;&s;umption of &s;piritual power interpo&s;e it&s;elf, as a medium, between CHRIST and his Church. The &s;heep will hear the voice of their own &s;hepherd; but <HI>they know not the voice of &s;trangers.</HI></P>
<P>WE claim no &s;acerdotal rights by virtue of any real or &s;uppo&s;ed uninterrupted &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion from the Apo&s;tles. With equal propriety might we &s;eek for evidence of our de&s;cent from Adam, to prove our&s;elves hu|man beings, as call over the roll of Bi&s;h|ops from the Apo&s;tles to this day, to entitle us to the character of Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters. As there are indubitable marks by which it is manife&s;t that we are of the human race, without the former; &s;o we conceive there are equally di&s;tingui&s;hing and &s;atisfactory marks of the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, without the latter. The children of GOD are made &s;uch, by the efficacious influence of his word and SPIRIT; from the &s;ame &s;ource are derived the qualifica|tions for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try; and the Churches of CHRIST have a right to call to the exerci&s;e of this office him whom they charitably judge the SPIRIT of GOD has qualified for it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="022275_0021_0FB7ACF15443C650">ON &s;uch an occa&s;ion, it is the duty and plea&s;ure of his brethren, while they bid him welcome as a labourer in the vineyard of their common LORD, to put him in mind of that &s;olemn CHARGE which the HOLY GHOST, in the writings of the Apo&s;tles, has given to him and to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>YOU will therefore, my dear Brother, permit me (though your inferiour in age, as well as in other re&s;pects) to call your attention, at this time, to tho&s;e &s;acred in|junctions which are given by the HOLY GHOST to you and to us.&mdash;They are the&s;e:</P>

<P>"LET no man de&s;pi&s;e thee, but be thou an example to the believers, in word, in conver&s;ation, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity.</P>
<P>"GIVE attention to reading, to exhorta|tion, to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, but meditate on the&s;e things, give thy&s;elf wholly to them, that thy prof|iting may appear unto all.</P>

<P>"THOSE who &s;in, rebuke before all, that others al&s;o may fear. Do nothing by par|tiality. Lay hands &s;uddenly on no man. Be not partaker of other men's &s;ins. Keep thy&s;elf pure.</P>

<HEAD>THE RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE REV. MR. <HI>ECKLEY.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>THE grand de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel is to give us information re&s;pecting another world, and teach us to find our way to heaven; where, as the friends and di&s;ciples of the Son of GOD, we may hold commu|nion with him in glory;&mdash;where, fed forev|er upon truth, and tran&s;ported with the di&s;plays of the divine maje&s;ty and beauty, we may &s;pend our time with holy angels; with prophets and apo&s;tles; with martyrs and all our fellow &s;aints, in wonder, love and prai&s;e.</P>

<P>TO promote the &s;tudy of divine truth;&mdash; to improve the Chri&s;tian's graces and in|crea&s;e his joys, it has &s;eemed good to the great Head over all things, to organize the members of his Church by certain e&s;tab|li&s;hed laws;&mdash;<HI>giving &s;ome, Apo&s;tles; and &s;ome, Prophets; and &s;ome, Evangeli&s;ts; and &s;ome, Pa&s;tors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Mini&s;try, for the edifying of the body of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>CONSIDERING that we are all &s;eeking the &s;ame heavenly home;&mdash;that we all ac|knowledge the &s;ame Ma&s;ter, and profe&s;s our hopes and joys to be of the &s;ame kind&mdash; how much does it become the members of CHRIST'S Church, who are now nece&s;&s;arily divided into many di&s;tinct &s;ocieties, to ven|erate and e&s;teem each other!&mdash;Yet not more than it becomes the Mini&s;ters of our common LORD, who are alike engaged in one honourable employment, and when faithful, are alike depending on one re|ward.</P>
