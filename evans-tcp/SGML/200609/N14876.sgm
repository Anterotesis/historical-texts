<HEAD>PREFACE&punc; To the Second Part.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of this Part of the In&s;titute, is to frame a Grammar of our own language upon its true principles, and calculate it for the benefit of common Engli&s;h &s;chools. No Grammar, that has hitherto appeared, &s;eems well adapted to an&s;wer this particular purpo&s;e. Mr. Dilworth's, which has had the mo&s;t general circulation in America, is not con|&s;tructed upon the principles of the Engli&s;h language; it is, to u&s;e the words of an eminent &s;cholar and critic, "A mere Latin Grammar, very indifferent|ly tran&s;lated." As to tho&s;e articles in which all languages agree, &s;uch as the general definition of nouns, adjectives, &amp;c. he is u&s;ually right; but wherever our language is built upon principles pe|culiar to it&s;elf, he is invariably wrong. We are apt to be &s;urpri&s;ed, that men who made the languages their principal &s;tudy, and during their whole lives, were employed in teaching youth, &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;|cover that the Grammar of one language would not an&s;wer for another; but our wonder will cea&s;e when we reflect, that the Engli&s;h nation a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> large have, till very lately, entertained the idea that our lan|guage was incapable of being reduced to a &s;y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of rules; and that even now many men of much cla&s;&s;ical learning warmly contend that the only way of ac|quiring, a grammatical knowledge of the <HI>Engli&s;h Tongue,</HI> is fir&s;t to learn a <HI>Latin Grammar,</HI> That &s;uch a &s;tupid opinion &s;hould ever have prevailed in the Engli&s;h nation&mdash;that it &s;hould &s;till have advo|cates&mdash;nay that it &s;hould &s;till be carried into prac|tice, can be re&s;olved into no cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the amazing influence of habit upon the human mind.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="018871_0003_0FA8213734DD4788">Our language has now arrived to a great degree of purity: and many writers of the la&s;t and pre&s;ent age have, both in elegance and &s;ublimity of &s;tyle, equaled, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Roman authors of the Augu&s;tan age. To frame &s;uch a Grammar as to in|&s;truct our own youth, as well as foreigners, in this purity of &s;tyle, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a Grammarian&mdash; a bu&s;ine&s;s that appears to be not yet accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Dr. Lowth was well acquainted with the origin and genius of the language; and his <HI>Short Introduc|tion to Engli&s;h Grammar,</HI> which is an original per|formance, cannot be &s;tudied with too much atten|tion. But his &s;tyle and method, are not &s;uited to the capacities of youth; his treati&s;e was expre&s;sly de&s;igned for a <HI>private and dome&s;tic u&s;e,</HI> and is exceed|ingly well calculated for this particular purpo&s;e, as well as for &s;chools of a higher cla&s;s. But with re|&s;pect to the Imperative Mode, the Pa&s;&s;ive Verb and &s;ome other matters of le&s;s moment, he &s;eems to have fallen into obvious mi&s;takes; and in the in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">exion of verbs he is exceedingly defective.</P>
<P>Mr. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hanan, a later and much celebrated Gram|marian, has given the world a <HI>Regular Engli&s;h Syn|tax</HI>&punc; he has improved upon Dr. Lowth's method and made many judicious remarks upon the con|&s;truction and arrangement of periods: But in the particulars above mentioned, he is liable to the &s;ame exceptions as his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> A&s;h has corrected &s;ome errors and &s;upplied &s;ome defects of the&s;e Authors; but has omitted other articles of equal importance.</P>
<P>In the &s;hort treati&s;e here pre&s;ented to the public, I have endeavoured to throw the principles of our language into a &s;tyle and method &s;uited to the mo&s;t ordinary capacities. I have generally adhered to the &s;y&s;tems of the re&s;pectable authorities above mentioned: Whenever I have deviated, it was with reluctance, but with the fulle&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion that I was
<PB N="5" REF="018871_0004_0FA821386615F448">
warranted by the nature and idioms of the lan|guage.</P>
<P>In that new and complicated &s;ubject, the illu&s;tra|tion of our helping verbs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> auxiliary &s;igns, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bliged to &s;truggle with a multitude of embarra&s;&s;|ments almo&s;t in&s;uperable. And after my mo&s;t la|borious efforts to define their &s;everal meanings and explain their various combinations with accuracy and per&s;picuity, I mu&s;t confe&s;s the execution of the de&s;ign is &s;carcely &s;atisfactory even to my&s;elf. I was under a nece&s;&s;ity of introducing a variety of di&s;tinc|tions and terms unknown to former Grammars, which may po&s;&s;ibly offend tho&s;e who are firmly at|tached to the rules and forms of antiquity. But &s;omething of this kind is certainly wanted: Our auxiliary &s;igns enable us to expre&s;s the circum&s;tances of time and mode, of power, liberty, nece&s;&s;ity, obli|gation, promi&s;e, determination and inclination, with greater clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion, than can be done in any other language with which we are acquainted. But we have no Grammar that unfolds this intricate &s;ubject; and though we are enabled to learn our own language by the ear, yet foreigners &s;eldom or never acquire &s;uch a knowledge of our verbs as to u&s;e them with tolerable propriety. I have attended to their inve&s;tigation with uncommon a&s;&s;iduity and in my re&s;earches, have perhaps found more difficulties than I am able to remove. I flatter my&s;elf, however, that upon &s;trict examination, it will be judged that I have introduced no di&s;tinction without a differ|ence, and that the propriety of any deviation from the received rules of former Grammars, is &s;upported by the e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of the language.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ody of our language has been neglected or mi&s;taken as much as any part of Grammar. That ma&s;ter-key to the pronunciation of Engli&s;h, the &s;ylla|bic accent, has been very little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nder&s;tood. Mr. Sheridan is the fir&s;t who has been &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="6" REF="018871_0005_0FA82138DDF97640">
its importance, and he is perhaps better acquaint|ed with its utility in pro&s;e than in ver&s;e. An at|tempt to inve&s;tigate the rules of numerous compo|&s;ition and illu&s;trate them by examples from the be&s;t authorities, &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to complete this Part of the In&s;titute.</P>
<P>In all the rules, definitions and illu&s;trations, accu|racy and per&s;picuity have been my principal &s;tudy; and I cannot but think that this will be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the length of the Di&s;&s;ertation on the Auxilia|ries, as well as &s;everal repetitions in the examples of fal&s;e con&s;truction and inelegant arrangement.</P>

<HEAD>VERB.</HEAD>
<P><HI>What is a verb?</HI> A <HI>verb</HI> is a part of &s;peech that &s;ignifies <HI>being</HI> or <HI>doing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How many kinds of verbs are there?</HI> Two, tran&s;itive and intran&s;itive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is the mo&s;t accurate and unexceptionable divi&s;ion of verbs; the common divi&s;ion into <HI>active, pa&s;&s;ive</HI> and <HI>neu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er</HI> is faulty. Many verbs commonly called <HI>active,</HI> imply no action at all, or of the mind only; as, to <HI>&s;ee,</HI> to <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> to <HI>feel;</HI> while &s;ome that are ranked under the term <HI>neuter,</HI> imply <HI>action</HI> merely; as, to <HI>run,</HI> to <HI>fly,</HI> &amp;c. The divi&s;ion into tran&s;itive and intran&s;itive, admits of no exception.</P>
<P>As to <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> verbs, we have no &s;uch thing in the language. I cannot better expre&s;s my ideas on this &s;ubject, than in the words of Dr. Ash, in a Grammar prefixed to his Dictionary. He ob|&s;erves that "Properly &s;peaking, there is no <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> verb in the English language; for though, <HI>I am loved,</HI> is commonly called a <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> verb, yet <HI>love</HI> is no part of the <HI>verb,</HI> but a <HI>participle</HI> or <HI>adjective</HI> derived of the verb, <HI>love.</HI>" "I am very &s;en&s;ible that the greate&s;t man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lowth, followed by Buchanan.</NOTE>, perhaps, that ever wrote on the &s;ubject, is of a different opinion. He &s;ays, "There are three kinds of verbs active, <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> and neuter." And when he comes to the gram|matical re&s;olution of this &s;entence, "<HI>In whom I am well plea&s;ed;</HI>" he tells us that <HI>am</HI> is "The indicative mode, pre&s;ent time, and fir&s;t per&s;on &s;ingular of the neuter verb <HI>to be; well</HI> an adverb; <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> the pa&s;&s;ive participle of the verb <HI>to plea&s;e,</HI> making with the aux|iliary verb <HI>am,</HI> a <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> verb." The con&s;ideration of this, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, could by no means induce me to &s;uppre&s;s the above note. In par&s;ing every word should be con&s;idered as a di&s;tinct part of &s;peech; for though two or more words may be united to form a mode, a ten&s;e or a compari&s;on; yet, it &s;eems quite im|proper to unite two or more words to make a noun, a verb or an adjective, &amp;c."</P>
<P>I am happy to find my own opinion &s;upported by &s;o re&s;pectable an authority as Dr. Ash; both with regard to the pa&s;&s;ive verb and the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perative mode. Grammarians, conforming to the inflection of Latin verbs, without attending to the principles of our own language, have con&s;idered the verb <HI>let</HI> merely as an aux|iliary &s;ign and have u&s;ed it to form the fir&s;t and third Per&s;ons of the imperative mode. It may be doubted whether, in any ca&s;e, the imperative admits of the&s;e per&s;ons; the &s;econd per&s;on only being the object of command or exhortation. But in mo&s;t ca&s;es, <HI>let</HI> is certainly a principal verb, of the &s;ame import as <HI>permit</HI> or <HI>&s;uffer,</HI> and u&s;ed in the &s;econd per&s;on of the imperative mode. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions therefore, <HI>let me write, let him write,</HI> &s;o far from being the fir&s;t and third per&s;ons, are in fact the &s;econd per|&s;on of the imperative. In &s;ome in&s;tances, they are merely ad|vi&s;ory, but in many ca&s;es, they imply a command, directed to a &s;econd per&s;on.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on hold me fa&s;t and I &s;ay to him, <HI>let me go,</HI> I pre&s;ume no one will contend that this is a command or exhortation di|rected to my&s;elf. In the fir&s;t per&s;on plural, <HI>let us go,</HI> has the force of advice and exhortation to a number, among whom, the &s;peaker includes him&s;elf, and this may po&s;&s;ibly be called the fir&s;t per&s;on of the imperative; but, <HI>let me, let him</HI> and <HI>let them,</HI> mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the &s;econd per&s;on, implying the &s;ame as <HI>&s;uffer</HI> or <HI>permit</HI> me, &amp;c. The Romans u&s;ed the fir&s;t per&s;on of the &s;ub|junctive mode for the purpo&s;e of exhorting; not having any fir&s;t per&s;on in the imperative. The French imperative has all per&s;ons, except the fir&s;t of the &s;ingular. The English imperative has no per&s;on but the &s;econd; to &s;upply the place of the fir&s;t and third in other languages, we u&s;e the verb <HI>let,</HI> with a pronoun in the objective ca&s;e and a verb in the infinitive.</P></NOTE>.

<HI>What is an intran&s;itive verb?</HI> An intran&s;itive verb implies <HI>action</HI> or <HI>being</HI> which is all confined to the agent or nominative word; therefore an object can follow the verb; as, <HI>I remain &mdash;he liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s&mdash;it dies &mdash;we run.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How do we know a tran&s;itive verb from an intran&s;itive?</HI> If a verb will admit an object after it, it is tran&s;i|tive; as, "I admire fidelity." "I abhor treachery."

<HEAD> MODE.</HEAD>
<P>Mode is the manner of repre&s;enting a being or action.</P>
<P>The Modes are five; the Infinitive, Indicative, Imperative, Potential and Subjunctive. The infini|tive expre&s;&s;es an action or being indefinitely, with|out regard to number or per&s;on; as, <HI>to &s;ee, to learn.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TENSE.</HEAD>
<P>Ten&s;e is the time of an action or being.</P>
<P>Time is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, divided only into pre&s;ent, pa&s;t, and future. But as we have occa&s;ion to point out the time of action with more preci&s;ion, we are obliged to u&s;e other artificial ten&s;es both &s;imple and compound. I &s;hall therefore divide the ten&s;es as u&s;ual into pre&s;ent, imperfect, perfect, pluperfect, and future, with the compound perfect and future.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent ten&s;e repre&s;ents an action as now performing; as, <HI>I write.</HI></P>
<P>The imperfect expre&s;&s;es an action that is pa&s;t; as, <HI>I wrote.</HI></P>
<P>The perfect repre&s;ents an action as pa&s;t and com|pleted; as, <HI>I have written.</HI></P>
<P>The pluperfect repre&s;ents an action as pa&s;t, prior to &s;ome period of time &s;pecified in the &s;entence; as, "<HI>I had written,</HI> when he came in."</P>
<P>The future repre&s;ents an action as yet to come; as, <HI>I &s;hall write.</HI></P>
<P>We u&s;e a ten&s;e compounded of the perfect and fu|ture, which I call the compound future: this denotes that at &s;ome time &s;pecified, an action will be pa&s;t; as, "when you have &s;upped, <HI>I &s;hall have fini&s;hed</HI> my bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>I may have written,</HI> &s;eems, to be a compound of the pre&s;ent and perfect, in the poten|tial mode. It expre&s;&s;es a <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> po&s;&s;ibility that an action has been done in &s;ome <HI>pa&s;t</HI> time: This I call the compound perfect.</P>
<P>But there is another important di&s;tinction of ten&s;es, peculiar to the Engli&s;h Language, viz. into <HI>indefinite</HI> and <HI>definite.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="018871_0023_0FA8214941BDCD00">The indefinite ten&s;es repre&s;ent an action as pre&s;ent, pa&s;t or future, in a vague indeterminate manner; the definite, a&s;certain &s;ome particular time or circum|&s;tances of action.</P>

<P><HI>Would</HI> in the fir&s;t per&s;on, without empha&s;is, is u&s;ed to expre&s;s a promi&s;e or intention conditionally; as, "I would go, if I had a hor&s;e." With empha&s;is, it imports a re&s;olution of the &s;peaker, which upon certain conditions, he was determined to carry into effect; as, "I <HI>would</HI> have gone, had I been in your place." In the &s;econd and third per&s;ons, without empha&s;is, it denotes intention or inclination or even event conditionally; as, "you would purcha&s;e, if you were able." With empha&s;is, it carries an idea of the &s;ettled purpo&s;e or determination of the per&s;on &s;poken of; as, "he <HI>would</HI> rule, if he could;" in which ca&s;e <HI>could</HI> is al&s;o emphatical.</P>
<P><HI>Would</HI> in the &s;econd and third per&s;ons is al&s;o u&s;ed to denote the certainty of an event which depended on the will of another per&s;on, who, unle&s;s &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances had prevented, would &s;urely have carri|ed his purpo&s;e into effect; as, "you <HI>would</HI> have gone, if I had had the care of you."

<P>In this phra&s;e "I would advi&s;e my friend to accept of the offer," there is no condition expre&s;&s;ed, but the &s;en&s;e evidently implies one. If I mean to give my advice ab&s;olutely, I expre&s;s my&s;elf thus, "I ad|vi&s;e or do advi&s;e him;" but "I would advi&s;e," im|plies a condition that "if I were a proper per&s;on," or "if my advice were a&s;ked," then, &amp;c. But <HI>would</HI> has, in many ca&s;es, u&s;urped the place of <HI>do</HI> and is u&s;ed to expre&s;s a po&s;itive declaration; I think im|properly; as when a per&s;on is a&s;ked if he will drink a gla&s;s of wine and he replies, "I <HI>would</HI> not chu&s;e any." He means ab&s;olutely, "he <HI>does</HI> not chu&s;e any" and ab&s;urdly u&s;es a conditional form of ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>MIGHT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Might</HI> is derived from <HI>may,</HI> but differs from it in this; <HI>may</HI> is an unconditional declaration of po&s;&s;i|bility or liberty; <HI>might</HI> expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame po&s;&s;ibility or liberty under a condition, which defeats the ef|fect; as, "I might go, if my ma&s;ter would permit."

In the pa&s;t ten&s;e, it is either ab&s;olute or conditional: <HI>Ab&s;olute;</HI> as, "I might have gone then, but had no inclination;" <HI>condition|al</HI>; as, "I might have gone, if bu&s;ine&s;s had not de|tained me."</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>MUST.</HEAD>
<P>This auxiliary denotes nece&s;&s;ity. It has no variation, but is u&s;ed in almo&s;t all ten&s;es of the potential mode.</P>
<P>Some Grammarians, if not all, have u&s;ed <HI>might, could, would,</HI> and <HI>&s;hould,</HI> as &s;igns of the imperfect ten&s;e only of the &s;ubjunctive mode and made little or no difference between the &s;ubjunctive and poten|tial. In both the&s;e particulars they appear to me to be inaccurate. The foregoing auxiliary &s;igns are more frequently u&s;ed in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e than in the imperfect. In the pre&s;ent ten&s;e they are always conditional&mdash;in the pa&s;t ten&s;e either ab&s;olute or con|ditional, according to the nature of the &s;entence. "I might go, if I had a hor&s;e" is pre&s;ent time and conditional; "I might not go ye&s;terday, but may go to day," are ab&s;olute declarations; the fir&s;t in the pa&s;t time and the la&s;t in the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In the &s;ubjunctive mode they are al&s;o u&s;ed as &s;igns of the imperfect ten&s;e; as, "I told him that I could
<PB N="31" REF="018871_0030_0FA8214EE472BBF8">
go; you &s;aid that I might go, &amp;c." As to a di&s;|tinction between the potential and &s;ubjunctive modes, it appears to me as real and important, as any di&s;|tinction in Grammar. Whenever there is a decla|ration that &s;omething is or is not &s;o, it is called the indicative mode. When there is a declaration, not that an action is done or not, but that there is a power, liberty &amp;c. of doing it, it is called with pro|priety the potential mode. The&s;e modes are inde|pendent of all others and may &s;tand alone, except the conditional ten&s;es of the potential, which have a nece&s;&s;ary connexion with &s;ome other mode, which is u&s;ually the &s;ubjunctive. But the &s;ubjunctive mode, is always dependent either on &s;ome conjunc|tion or &s;ome preceding verb The dependence of the modes upon each other may be thus explained.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="examples">
<P>1. The ab&s;olute ten&s;es of the potential mode may &s;tand alone; but when they have any connexion with another mode, they are preceded or followed by an ab&s;olute declaration in the indicative mode, or a doubtful ten&s;e of the &s;ubjunctive.</P>

the ab&s;olute ten&s;es with the conditional. Thus "I can write, but I would not;" "I can write, if I plea&s;ed;" "I could write, if I plea&s;e," are evident improprieties.

<HEAD>SUBJUNCTIVE MODE.</HEAD>
<P>This mode is u&s;ed to expre&s;s &s;omething of a doubt|ful, contingent, or indeterminate nature. It is al|ways preceded by &s;ome other verb on which it has dependence; or by &s;ome conjunction, implying <HI>condition, &s;uppo&s;ition,</HI> &amp;c. as, <HI>if, unle&s;s, though, whether, le&s;t</HI> or <HI>except.</HI> Its ten&s;es &s;eem to require a curious di&s;tinction which I have never &s;een &s;ufficiently il|lu&s;trated. Whenever we &s;peak of a matter of cer|tainty, we u&s;e the indicative mode after any of the foregoing conjunctions. For example, "<HI>though</HI> Ar|nold <HI>was</HI> an American by birth, yet he betrayed his country." Here is no doubt with re&s;pect to the fact; we therefore u&s;e the indicative mode <HI>was,</HI> after <HI>though.</HI> But when there is any doubt or condition with re&s;pect to the fact, we u&s;e the &s;ubjunctive mode; as, "though he <HI>&s;lay</HI> me yet will I put my tru&s;t in him." Job xiii.15. Here is a condition implied; it would therefore be improper to u&s;e the indicative, "though he <HI>&s;lays</HI> me, &amp;c. But in this
<PB N="41" REF="018871_0040_0FA82159C562AD68">
mode we u&s;e another ten&s;e, which has not been no|ticed; and which implies the &s;uppo&s;ition of a fact di|rectly the rever&s;e of what is mentioned. That is, an affirmative &s;entence amounts to a full declaration in the negative; and a negative &s;entence implies a declaration or confe&s;&s;ion of the affirmative. Thus, "if I were in Charle&s;town," &s;uppo&s;es I am not in Charle&s;town; but, "if I were not in Hartford," im|plies a full certainty that I am in Hartford. This ten&s;e which, in principal verbs, is the &s;ame as the imperfect of the indicative mode, I &s;hall denominate <HI>hypothetical;</HI> the other, the doubtful ten&s;e.</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of a fact certain in our own minds or granted by all parties, we u&s;e the indicative; as, "if I <HI>am</HI> writing, it is not your concern."</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of a doubtful matter, we u&s;e the &s;ubjunctive mode; "if I be writing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At lea&s;t this was formerly the ca&s;e.

We &s;ay, <HI>if he is, if you are,</HI> in ca&s;es of uncertainty, and <HI>you be, I be,</HI> in declaratory phra&s;es.

<P>When we &s;peak of a fact which we allow is not &s;o, but if it were, we want to inform what the con&s;equence would be, we u&s;e the imperfect ten&s;e of the indicative mode; as, "if I were writing;" or rather, "if I <HI>wrote</HI> as well as you do, I &s;hould think my&s;elf an excellent penman." This phra&s;e thus u&s;ed, becomes pre&s;ent time and belongs to the &s;ub|junctive mode. This perhaps will hardly be admit|ted; and yet it is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> much u&s;ed as any in the language. The phra&s;es, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld go, if it <HI>did</HI> not rain;" "I would walk, if I <HI>were</HI> not lame;" "I would ride, if I <HI>had</HI> a hor&s;e;" "if he <HI>attended</HI> to his &s;tudies, he would make a figure, in the literary world;" are as frequent as any in the language;

they are evidently pre&s;ent time and de&s;erve a &s;epa|rate place in Grammar. It is needle&s;s to enquire how this came to be the ca&s;e or to object to its pro|priety. Cu&s;tom is &s;overeign in the u&s;e of language; and when univer&s;al invariable cu&s;tom has introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed any form of expre&s;&s;ion, we may po&s;|&s;ibly doubt its analogy to the rules of other languages, but ought not to &s;cruple its propriety in our own.</P>

<P>Note, The conjunction is very often omitted and the nominative placed after the verb or auxiliary; as, "were I pre&s;ent," in&s;tead of, "if I were pre&s;ent;" "had I been learned," in&s;tead of, "if I had been learned." This is a common mode of expre&s;&s;ion and by no means in elegant.</P>
<P>In the inflection of the foregoing regular verb, the &s;everal combinations of auxiliaries have been deline|ated, and their u&s;es explained.

<P>The remarks made under the &s;ubjunctive of <HI>be</HI> and <HI>do,</HI> with re&s;pect to the doubtful and hypothetical forms of <HI>power,</HI> &amp;c. apply to this verb.</P>
<P>In the foregoing analy&s;is of verbs in the Subjunc|tive mode, I have explained them according to their u&s;ual &s;en&s;e, when preceded by the conjunction <HI>if.</HI> But when preceded by other conjunctions, the phra&s;es vary their meaning according to the purport of the conjunction. The difference however is im|material and will lead into no &s;en&s;ible errors.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the auxiliaries, it is to be further ob&s;erved, that <HI>have</HI> is u&s;ed only before the participles ending in <HI>ed, t,</HI> or <HI>n. Be</HI> is u&s;ed before all participles. All the other auxiliaries are u&s;ed only before the verb in its original form; and the pa&s;t time will ad|mit no preceding auxiliary. For example.</P>

original form. The pa&s;t time <HI>did</HI> admits no auxiliary. The participle <HI>done</HI> is u&s;ed after <HI>have</HI> and <HI>be,</HI> but <HI>be</HI> only is u&s;ed with <HI>doing.</HI></P>
<P>When an auxiliary is joined to a verb, the auxilia|ry only is varied; as, "I <HI>&s;hall</HI> do, thou <HI>&s;halt</HI> do," &amp;c.</P>

<P>Intran&s;itive verbs will very &s;eldom admit of the pa&s;&s;ive form; in &s;ome in&s;tances they will&mdash;and when this is the ca&s;e, the participle, joined with the aux|iliary <HI>be,</HI> becomes a mere adjective, and the verb is intran&s;itive; as, "I am fallen, I am grown," &amp;c.</P>

The expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>I have wrote, I have bare, I have be|gan, I have drove,</HI> &amp;c. which are &s;o much in vogue, are &s;hocking improprieties: The childi&s;h phra&s;es, <HI>you am, I is,</HI> &amp;c. are not more repugnant to the rules of Grammar.</P>
<P>And yet men of the fir&s;t reputation, will indulge fa&s;hionable errors, which they know have a tenden|cy to embarra&s;s a language built on the &s;imple&s;t prin|ciples, and eventually to de&s;troy all rules of analogy. An ancient Roman would be &s;tartled to hear a Latin Grammarian u&s;e <HI>ille fuit amatus e&s;t</HI>&punc; a Frenchman, to hear, <HI>il a punit</HI>&mdash;and the mo&s;t unlettered Engli&s;h|man would laugh to hear another &s;ay, <HI>he has went,</HI> or <HI>it will be gave;</HI> and yet, <HI>I have wrote, have drove,</HI> &amp;c. which are quite as improper, have become &s;o familiar to our ears, that we can every hour hear them uttered by &s;ome of our be&s;t Grammarians without a &s;mile of ridicule. <HI>I have written, have driv|en,</HI> &amp;c. are as ea&s;y to be learned and employed as the pa&s;t ten&s;e <HI>wrote</HI> and <HI>drove;</HI> and it is inexcu&s;able to &s;acrifice propriety to any con&s;ideration whatever.</P>

<P>The words, <HI>veracitas, conver&s;atio</HI> &amp;c. in the La|tin language, conveyed the &s;ame ideas as <HI>truth, talk</HI> &amp;c. in the Saxon and in the modern Engli&s;h. Where the Latin has not furni&s;hed us with a conve|nient word, we have borrowed from the Greek and French, and &s;ometimes from the modern German. This in one re&s;pect is a real advantage to the lan|guage; as it affords a variety of words to expre&s;s our ideas, and prevents the nece&s;&s;ity of repeating the &s;ame words, as was the ca&s;e with &s;ome of the anci|ent oriental languages. At the &s;ame time, it leads ignorant and half-learned people into the frequent and di&s;agreeable u&s;e of &s;ynonymous terms. Thus we often hear it &s;aid that "he is a man of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>veracity,</HI>" which is &s;aying no more than that he is a man of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>truth.</HI> In the &s;olemn act of prayer, we often hear the Deity intreated to <HI>keep</HI> and <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> us; which, by any explication, will amount to no more than an interce&s;&s;ion to <HI>keep</HI> and <HI>keep</HI> us.</P>
<P>The Hebrew language, at the time the &s;cripures
<PB N="113" REF="018871_0112_0FA820E84BA47800">
were written, con&s;i&s;ted of few words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of about two thou&s;and words. The Eng|lish contains twenty thou&s;and; be&s;ides the &s;ingular advantage of compo&s;ition, which by prefixing to words certain particles and annexing terminations of determinate and known &s;ignifica|tions, renders the language capable of an endle&s;s variety.</NOTE>, and in or|der to expre&s;s ideas with uncommon energy, the writers were obliged to u&s;e repetitions. But the, copiou&s;ne&s;s of our language &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;i|ty and con&s;equently the propriety of u&s;ing two or three &s;ynonymous terms to expre&s;s any idea, how|ever forcible: And in expre&s;&s;ing the common un|important ideas of mankind, every word that does not add &s;omethig to the meaning of a phra&s;e, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as &s;uperfluous and detracting from the beauty of &s;tyle. To &s;et this impropriety in a &s;triking point of light, I will in&s;ert a pa&s;&s;age from the Spectator, No. 302, and add a great number of &s;ynonymous terms to the original.</P>
<P>"Who ever beheld <HI>and &s;aw</HI> the charming Emi|lia without feeling in his brea&s;t at once the glow <HI>and ardour</HI> of love, and the tenderne&s;s of virtuous friend|&s;hip. The un&s;tudied <HI>and natural</HI> graces of her be|haviour and the plea&s;ing <HI>and agreeable</HI> accents of her tongue, in&s;en&s;ibly <HI>and imperceptibly</HI> draw you on to wi&s;h for a nearer enjoyment of them; but even her &s;miles carry in them a &s;ilent reproof to the impul&s;es of licentious <HI>and lawle&s;s</HI> love. Thus, though the attractives of her beauty play almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly up|on you and create <HI>and give birth to</HI> de&s;ire, you im|mediately &s;tand corrected, not by the &s;everity <HI>and rigour,</HI> but by the decency of her virtue. That &s;weetne&s;s and good humour, which is &s;o vi&s;ible <HI>and apparent</HI> in her face <HI>and countenance,</HI> naturally dif|fu&s;es <HI>and &s;preads</HI> it&s;elf into every word and action. A man mu&s;t be a &s;avage who, at the &s;ight <HI>and view</HI> of Emilia, is not more inclined <HI>and di&s;po&s;ed</HI> to do her good than to gratify him&s;elf. Her per&s;on, as it is

<P>In this beautiful de&s;cription of female excellence, the words in Italics are &s;uperfluous: Let them be omitted and we have the pa&s;&s;age in the original &s;tyle, which is pure and elegant.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be remarked that cu&s;tom has affixed very different meanings to the &s;ame words and ve|ry often different from the original &s;en&s;e. Thus <HI>freedom</HI> is much more general in its &s;ignification, than <HI>exemption.</HI> To &s;ay a man is <HI>free</HI> from trouble and <HI>exempt</HI> from trouble, is &s;aying the &s;ame thing: But the phra&s;e <HI>political exemption</HI> is not admi&s;&s;ible; though <HI>political freedom</HI> is as common and proper as any phra&s;e in the language. When therefore I &s;ay that two words of the &s;ame import ought not to be u&s;ed at the &s;ame time, I would be under&s;tood to mean, that they ought not to be u&s;ed to convey ex|actly the &s;ame idea.</P>

<P>Mr. Sheridan, who has taken more pains to regu|late the pronunciation of the Engli&s;h language, than any other writer, defines accent to be the &s;tre&s;s of voice on a particular letter of a &s;yllable, which di&s;|tingui&s;hes it from the re&s;t; and confines empha&s;is to tho&s;e particular words in a &s;entence, which de|mand, not only a greater &s;tre&s;s, but a change of tone in the voice.</P>
<P>This definition of accent appears to be more ac|curate and u&s;eful, than the former, e&s;pecially as it enables us to make, in all words, the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;|tinction
<PB N="120" REF="018871_0119_0FA820ED8A2B9F58">
between accented vowels and accented con|&s;onants.</P>
<P>But this is not perfectly accurate; for by this rule, no word con&s;i&s;ting of more letters than one, can be unaccented; and he calls the particles <HI>of, at, in, to,</HI> &amp;c. unaccented by mi&s;take; while the pro|noun <HI>I,</HI> which often requires great &s;tre&s;s of voice, without change of note, can have no accent, becau&s;e it has but one letter.</P>
<P>Perhaps the following definitions may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rly ex|plain the di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>In every word in the Engli&s;h language, there is &s;ome particular letter on which the &s;tre&s;s of the voice falls in pronouncing it. This &s;tre&s;s of the voice, regulated merely by the rule of pronunciation, I would call <HI>accent.</HI> Empha&s;is is a &s;tre&s;s of voice, regulated only by the &s;en&s;e and importance of the word; but it always falls on the accented letter.</P>
<P>Empha&s;is is of two kinds; the fir&s;t I call the <HI>natu|ral</HI> empha&s;is, as it is con&s;tant and invariable, and de|pends on the importance of the word with re&s;pect to the idea it conveys, without regarding its relation to other words in the &s;entence.</P>
<P>Thus the words <HI>man, hou&s;e, &s;trength,</HI> are in their nature important and con&s;equently emphatical in any &s;entence where they can be placed. They will naturally be pronounced with more force than the particles, <HI>at, of, in,</HI> &amp;c. which in&s;tead of being <HI>unac|cented,</HI> as Mr. Sheridan calls them, are more properly <HI>unemphatical.</HI> All nouns and principal verbs have this empha&s;is in the highe&s;t degree&mdash;all adjective<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> participles and adverbs, in a le&s;s degree&mdash;pronouns though they &s;upply the place of nouns, are generally deprived of empha&s;is in pronunciation. Conjunc|tions, interjections, prepo&s;itions, auxiliaries and ar|ticles, are in their nature unemphatical. This kind of empha&s;is requires no change of tone, but only that natural force of voice with which we pronounce important words.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="018871_0120_0FA820F0B316E738">The other kind of empha&s;is, which is the mo&s;t forcible, depends merely on the importance of the word on which it falls, in the particular &s;entence where it is u&s;ed. It often determines the &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, and u&s;ually requires a change of tone as well as &s;tre&s;s of voice on the accented letter. This empha&s;is, which may be called <HI>accidental,</HI> being regulated entirely by the &s;en&s;e, may fall on any word in the language and cau&s;e particles to be pronounced with the highe&s;t &s;tre&s;s of voice.</P>
<P>Scarcely any &s;ubject has been le&s;s attended to than Engli&s;h Pro&s;ody. Grammarians have gone no farther than to divide the kinds of ver&s;e into the iambic, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and anapae&s;tic, and to di&s;tingui&s;h them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> number of &s;yllables in each line. The rule laid down generally for the heroic mea&s;ure, is, that it con&s;i&s;ts of five feet and that to make a perfectly regular ver&s;e, the&s;e ought to be all iambic, with this exception only that the fir&s;t foot may &s;ome|times be a trochee. All variations from the iambic in the &s;ub&s;equent feet, are con&s;idered as defects in the &s;tructure of the ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e rules have taught all common readers of poetry to affect the placing of the accent or empha|&s;is on every &s;econd &s;yllable, which makes our ver&s;i|fication thus pronounced, the mo&s;t monotonous and ridiculous of all poetry in the world. But the truth is, our heroic iambic ver&s;e admits of a greater varie|ty of feet, than the heroic mea&s;ure of any language with which I am acquainted. The Latin and Greek, as it is well known, admit but two, the dactyl and &s;pondee, except only that the la&s;t foot may be a trochee; which however in that place can hardly be perceived by the ear.</P>
<P>In order to explain the nature of Engli&s;h ver&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome rules concerning long and &s;hort &s;yllables in our language, which has not yet been attempted on its true principles&mdash;the Latin
<PB N="122" REF="018871_0121_0FA820F1E7B89828">
pro&s;ody having nothing to do with the Engli&s;h lan|guage.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Every accented &s;yllable is long. This has never been doubted, where the accent falls on a vowel; as, <HI>glo-ry, ho-ly.</HI> Where the accent falls on a con&s;onant, as in <HI>hab-it, bat-tle,</HI> the preceding vowel is undoubtedly &s;hort; but the &s;yllable is neverthe|le&s;s long. Thus in the &s;yllable <HI>prac,</HI> the vowel is as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;yllable being clo&s;ed by a pure mute con&s;onant; but when we join to it another &s;yllable, if it begin with a con&s;onant; as, <HI>prac-tice,</HI> the time required to place the organs of &s;peech in a po&s;ition to pronounce the con&s;onants, renders the &s;yllable as long as if the accent lay on the vowel. And if the following &s;yllable begin with a vowel, we cannot avoid joining to it the la&s;t con&s;onant, which is the &s;ame as doubling the con&s;onant; for the words <HI>hab-it</HI> and <HI>hab-bit</HI> are pronounced preci&s;e|ly alike and in the &s;ame &s;pace of time. And I ap|peal to the mo&s;t accurate ear, whether there be any difference in the ordinary pronunciation of the&s;e words <HI>glo-ry, ho-ly, hab-it, prac-tice.</HI></P>
<P>This difference however mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that all accented &s;yllables are not equally long, for all are not equally accented. In many poly&s;yllables, be|&s;ides the principal accent, there is a weaker accent on another &s;yllable, which may with propriety be called the half accent. Thus in the word <HI>ex-po&s;-tu-la-to-ry,</HI> the full accent is on the &s;econd &s;yllable and the half accent on the fifth; this &s;yllable is longer and more di&s;tinctly articulated than the unaccented &s;yllables, though it is not &s;o long as the &s;econd, on which lies the principal accent.</P>
<P>The half accent, e&s;pecially when it follows the full accent, renders &s;uch words ungraceful in poetry, except in one &s;ingle place in the ver&s;e; for the half accent may fall gracefully upon the la&s;t &s;yllable but two, as in the&s;e lines of an anonymous writer:
<Q><PB N="123" REF="018871_0122_0FA820F217A9B188">
<L>"A new di&s;grace inevitably &s;heds."</L>
<L>"Gives the keen cur&s;e accumulated gall."</L></Q></P>
<P>When the half accent precedes the full accent, it is &s;tronger&mdash;indeed in many words there are two accents almo&s;t equal; as, exaltation, explanation, commutation; and &s;uch words, if they exceed not four &s;yllables, are graceful in poetry</P>
<P N="2">2d. Every emphatical &s;yllable is long. This rule applies to all mono&s;yllable nouns and all other mono|&s;yllables u&s;ed emphatically. In the&s;e lines of Pope's,
<Q><L>"Re&s;pecting man, whatever <HI>wrong</HI> we call</L>
<L><HI>May, mu&s;t</HI> be <HI>right,</HI> as relative to all."</L></Q>
The mono&s;yllables <HI>wrong, right, may, mu&s;t,</HI> the two former of which being adjectives, are naturally em|phatical; and the two la&s;t which are auxiliaries, and accidentally &s;o&mdash;are all important&mdash;and in pronun|ciation are equally long.</P>
<P N="3">3d. All unaccented &s;yllables are, in our language, naturally &s;hort. The voice is to dwell on there no longer than is nece&s;&s;ary to pronounce di&s;tinctly the combination of letters of which they are compo&s;ed. And although &s;ome of them, having more con&s;o|nants, require more time in pronouncing than others, yet this makes no difference in their u&s;e or effect in poetry.</P>
<P N="4">4th. All unemphatical mono&s;yllables are naturally &s;hort; as, prepo&s;itions, conjunctions, adverbs and articles.</P>
<P>From the foregoing rules, it appears that the move|ment of our ver&s;e is regulated by accent and empha|&s;is<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That the movement of our ver&s;e depends not on the length of the vowels, is evident from this; that our longe&s;t vowels and diphthongs are often thrown into the shorte&s;t place in the line and that without injuring the ver&s;ification.
<Q><P>"Above, how high, progre&s;&s;ive lif: <HI>may</HI> go!"</P>

&s;en&s;e as &s;yllables are denominated long in the Greek and Roman languages, is a di&s;pute of little con&s;e|quence.

In learn|ing our language, it is of the highe&s;t importance to know the long vowels from the short; but in inve&s;tigating the rules of ver&s;e, we are to attend le&s;s to the length of the vowels than to that of the &s;yllables, which depends much upon the combination of con&s;onants and the force of utterance.</NOTE></P>

<P>I'm^1 all^1&mdash;&s;ubmi&s;^2 ^1&mdash;&s;ion^2; what^1&mdash;you'd^1 have^1&mdash;<HI>it,^2 make^1 it.^2</HI></P>

<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But this is improper in the &s;olemn &s;tyle.</P>
<P>It may be al&s;o remarked that in di&s;&s;yllables and poly&s;yllables, the accented &s;yllable can never be the fir&s;t &s;yllable of a foot in any place but the fir&s;t, in which a di&s;&s;yllable will make a graceful trochee. But an emphatical mono&s;yllable may &s;tand in any place in the line.</P>
<P>In Engli&s;h poetry, there are as many full accents or equivalent empha&s;es, as there are nouns, adjectives, verbs or participles in a line; be&s;ides many other words which are accidentally emphatical. This is a &s;ource of great variety in our ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>A regular, though weak line, may be compo&s;ed with but <HI>three</HI> emphatical or accented &s;yllables; as,
<Q>Or^2 to^2&mdash;a^2 &s;ad^1&mdash;vari^2 ^1&mdash;ety^2 ^2&mdash;of^2 woe.^1</Q></P>
<P>And with <HI>four,</HI> very frequently; as,
<Q><P>'He^2 mounts^1&mdash;the^2 &s;torm^1&mdash;and^2 walks^1&mdash;upon^2 ^2&mdash;the^2 wind.'^1</P>

<P><PB N="130" REF="018871_0129_0FA820F80EC30998">Hence lines, abounding with mono&s;yllables that are emphatical, are the mo&s;t forcible and &s;olemn; but are often two much encumbered.</P>
<P>To end a line with a tri&s;&s;yllable, the la&s;t &s;yllable of which has the half accent or none at all, though &s;ometimes practi&s;ed by our be&s;t Poets, is &s;ubver&s;ive of all harmony and contrary to the genius of our poetry.</P>

<P>It is a pity that &s;uch improprieties &s;hould be min|gled with the be&s;t productions in the language.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked that the rules given above ap|ply particularly to rhyme; for in blank ver&s;e, a much greater licence may be indulged without injuring the verification.</P>
<P>It would exceed the limits of my de&s;ign to enter into a particular explanation of the other kinds of Engli&s;h ver&s;e; and it is rather unnece&s;&s;ary, as they depend much upon the &s;ame principles as the iam|bic mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The trochaic mea&s;ure, con&s;i&s;ting of three, five or &s;even &s;yllables, the lines beginning with an accented &s;yllable, is but an elliptical form of the iambic; for by prefixing a &s;hort &s;yllable to each line, the ver&s;e becomes purely iambic; as,

<P>With re&s;pect to the pau&s;es of our ver&s;e, which con&s;titute an e&s;&s;ential article, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that they are of two kinds; the ce&s;ural pau&s;e, and the final.</P>
<P>The ce&s;ural pau&s;e happens in almo&s;t every line of heroic ver&s;e and after almo&s;t every &s;yllable: But it is mo&s;t graceful after the 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th &s;yllables.</P>
<P>After the fourth; as,

<P>And it very frequently happens that either the &s;en&s;e or harmony or both require two or more &s;emi-pau&s;es; as,

<HEAD>PUNCTUATION. Abridged from Dr. Lowth.</HEAD>
<P>Punctuation is the art of marking in writing the &s;everal pau&s;es or re&s;ts between &s;entences and the parts of &s;entences.</P>
<P>As the &s;everal articulate &s;ounds, the &s;yllables and words, of which &s;entences con&s;i&s;t, are marked by letters; &s;o the pau&s;es, between &s;entences and their parts, are marked by points.</P>
<P>The different degrees of connection between the
<PB N="133" REF="018871_0132_0FA820FA4EB18538">
parts of &s;entences, require a great variety of pau&s;es o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> different lengths; yet, to expre&s;s this variety, we u&s;e only four points. For this rea&s;on the doctrine of punctuation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be imperfect and not reducible to preci&s;e rules.</P>
<P>But a few general remarks on this &s;ubject may be u&s;eful in directing the judgment of the learner.</P>
<P>The points u&s;ed to make the pau&s;es between &s;entences and their &s;everal parts, are the period, co|lon, &s;emicolon, and comma. The proportional quantity of time between the&s;e may be, as, &s;ix, four, two and one.</P>
<P>The period is the whole &s;entence complete in it&s;elf, wanting nothing to make a full and perfect &s;en&s;e, and not connected in con&s;truction with a &s;ub&s;equent &s;entence.</P>
<P>The colon or member, is a chief con&s;tructive part, or greater divi&s;ion of a &s;entence.</P>
<P>The &s;emicolon or half member, is a le&s;s con&s;truc|tive part or &s;ubdivi&s;ion of a &s;entence or member.</P>
<P>A &s;entence or member is again &s;ubdivided into commas or &s;egments; which are the lea&s;t con&s;truc|tive &s;en&s;e of a &s;entence or member, in this way of con&s;idering it; for the next &s;ubdivi&s;ion would be the re&s;olution of it into phra&s;es and words.</P>
<P>In order the more clearly to determine the proper application of the point which marks it, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between an imperfect phra&s;e, a &s;imple &s;entence, and a compound &s;entence.</P>
<P>An imperfect phra&s;e contains no a&s;&s;ertion, or does not amount to a propo&s;ition or &s;entence.</P>
<P>A &s;imple &s;entence has but one &s;ubject, and one fi|nite verb.</P>
<P>A compounded &s;entence has more than one &s;ub|ject, or one finite verb, either expre&s;&s;ed or under|&s;tood; or it con&s;i&s;ts of two or more &s;imple &s;entences connected together.</P>
<P>In a &s;entence, the &s;ubject and the verb may be each
<PB N="134" REF="018871_0133_0FA820FB0F726050">
of them accompanied with &s;everal adjuncts; as the object, the end, the circum&s;tance of time, place, and manner, and the like : and this, either immediately, or mediately; that is, by being connected with &s;omething which is connected with &s;ome other; and &s;o on.</P>
<P>If the &s;everal adjuncts affect the &s;ubject or the verb in a different manner, they are only &s;o many imperfect phra&s;es; and the &s;entence is &s;imple.</P>
<P>A &s;imple &s;entence admits of no point by which it may be divided, or di&s;tingui&s;hed into parts.</P>
<P>If the &s;everal adjuncts affect the verb in the &s;ame manner, they may be re&s;olved into &s;o many &s;imple &s;entences; the &s;entence then becomes compounded, and it mu&s;t be divided into its parts by points.</P>
<P>For, if there are &s;everal &s;ubjects belonging in the &s;ame manner to one verb, or &s;everal verbs belonging in the &s;ame manner to one &s;ubject, the &s;ubjects and verbs, are &s;till to be accounted equal in number: for every verb mu&s;t have its &s;ubject, and every &s;ubject its verb; and every one of the &s;ubjects or verbs; &s;hould or may have its point of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>EXAMPLES.</P>
<P>"The pa&s;&s;ion for prai&s;e produces excellent effects in women of &s;en&s;e." Addi&s;on, Spect. No. 73. In this &s;entence <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> is the &s;ubject, and <HI>produces</HI> the verb: Each of which is accompanied and connected with its adjuncts. The &s;ubject is not pa&s;&s;ion in general, but a particular pa&s;&s;ion determined by its adjunct of &s;pecification, as we may call it, the pa&s;&s;ion <HI>for prai&s;e.</HI> So likewi&s;e the verb is immediately connected with its object, <HI>excellent effects</HI>&punc; and me|diately, that is, by the intervention of the word <HI>ef|fects,</HI> with <HI>women,</HI> the &s;ubject in which the&s;e effects are produced; which again is connected with its adjunct of &s;pecification; for it is not meant of wo|men in general, but of women <HI>of &s;en&s;e</HI> only. La&s;t|ly, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the verb is connected
<PB N="135" REF="018871_0134_0FA820FBEB8C3568">
with each of the&s;e &s;everal adjuncts in a different manner; namely, with <HI>effects,</HI> as the object; with <HI>women,</HI> as the &s;ubject of them; with <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> as the quality or characteri&s;tic of tho&s;e women. The ad|juncts therefore are only &s;o many imperfect phra&s;es; the &s;entence is a &s;imple &s;entence, and admits of no point, by which it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into parts.</P>
<P>"The pa&s;&s;ion for prai&s;e, which is &s;o very vehe|ment in the fair &s;ex, produces excellent effects in women of &s;en&s;e." Here a new verb is introduced, accompanied with adjuncts of its own; and the &s;ub|ject is repeated by the relative pronoun <HI>which.</HI> It now becomes a compounded &s;entence, made up of two &s;imple &s;entences, one of which is in&s;erted in the middle of the other; it mu&s;t therefore be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into its component parts by a point placed on each &s;ide of the additional &s;entence.</P>
<Q><P>"How many in&s;tances have we [in the fair &s;ex] of cha&s;tity, fidelity, devotion? How many ladies di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the education of their chil|dren, care of their family, and love of their hu&s;bands; which are the great qualities and atchievements of woman kind; as the making of war, the carrying on of traffic, the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, are tho&s;e by which men grow famous, and get them&s;elves a name."</P>
<BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></Q>
<P>In the fir&s;t of the&s;e two &s;entences, the adjuncts <HI>cha&s;tity, fidelity, devotion,</HI> are connected with the verb by the word <HI>in&s;tances</HI> in the &s;ame manner, and in effect make &s;o many di&s;tinct &s;entences: "How many in&s;tances have we of cha&s;tity? How many in|&s;tances have we of fidelity? How many in&s;tances have we of devotion?" They mu&s;t therefore be &s;epa|rated from one another by a point. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the adjuncts, "education of their chil|dren, &amp;c" in the former part of the next &s;entence: as likewi&s;e of the &s;everal &s;ubjects, "the making of war, &amp;c." in the latter part, which have in effect

each their verb; for each of the&s;e "is an atchieve|ment by which men grow famous."</P>
<P>As &s;entences them&s;elves are divided into &s;imple and compounded, &s;o the members of &s;entences may be divided into &s;imple and compounded members: for who&s;e &s;entences, whether compounded or un|compounded, may become members of other &s;en|tences, by means of &s;ome additional connection.</P>
<P>Simple members of &s;entences clo&s;ely connected together in one compounded member, or &s;entence, are di&s;tingui&s;hed or &s;eparated by a comma: as in the foregoing examples.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e, the ca&s;e ab&s;olute; nouns in appo&s;i|tion, when con&s;i&s;ting of many terms; the participle with &s;omething depending on it; are to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the comma: for they may be re&s;olved into &s;imple members.</P>
<P>When an addre&s;s is made to a per&s;on; the noun, an&s;wering to the vocative ca&s;e in Latin, is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a comma.</P>

<P>Two nouns, or two adjectives, connected by a &s;ingle copulative or disjunctive, are not &s;eparated by a point; but when there are more than two, or where the conjunction is under&s;tood, they mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a comma.</P>
<P>Simple members connected by relatives, and com|paratives, are for the mo&s;t part di&s;tingui&s;hed by a comma, but when the members are &s;hort, in com|parative &s;entences; and when two members are clo&s;ely connected by a relative re&s;training the gene|ral notion of the antecedent to a particular &s;en&s;e; the pau&s;e becomes almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, and the comma is better omitted.</P>
