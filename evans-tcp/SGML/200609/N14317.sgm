<HEAD>NEW YEAR VERSES, Addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e Gentlemen who have been plea&s;ed to favour <HI>Francis Wrigley,</HI> News Car|rier, with their Cu&s;tom. <HI>JANUARY</HI> 1, 1783.</HEAD>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> the Times have been hard, and our Commerce gone wrong,</L>
<L>We &s;till have been able to &s;truggle along.</L>
<L>If &s;ome, thro' Misfortunes, are &s;lack in the Pur&s;e,</L>
<L>It is not &s;o bad but it might have been wor&s;e.</L>
<L>Great Things, the Year pa&s;t, were reveal'd to our Eyes:</L>
<L>The Dutch have confe&s;s'd us their Friends and Allies,</L>
<L>And humbled the Pride of our haughty Invaders,</L>
<L>By fighting their Fleets and de&s;troying their Traders.</L>
<L>If the Engli&s;h &s;ucceeded in taking the COUNT,</L>
<L>To what, in the End, did their Conque&s;t amount?</L>
<L>With their Boa&s;ts, and their Brags, and their Shouts of Applau&s;e,</L>
<L>It but &s;av'd them from Ruin,&mdash;not ruin'd our Cau&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But leaving the Weight of political Cares</L>
<L>To tho&s;e, who are plac'd at the Helm of Affairs,</L>
<L>To the Humours of Fortune in all Things re&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>I mean by my Vi&s;it to put you in Mind,</L>
<L>That, as true as a Clock, both early and late,</L>
<L>With the News of the Day I have knock'd at your Gate,</L>
<L>And gave you to know what the World was a-doing,</L>
<L>What LOUIS intended, or GEORGE was a-brewing.</L>
<L>If &s;ometimes the Papers were trifling and flat,</L>
<L>And the News went again&s;t us,&mdash;I cou'dn't help that;</L>
<L>If Parties were angry, and vented their Spite,</L>
<L>I bro't you their Wranglings,&mdash;not help'd them to write.</L>
<L>I therefore pre&s;ume (and not without Rea&s;on)</L>
<L>You'll remember your NEWSMAN, and think of the Sea&s;on;</L>
<L>The Markets are high, and the Weather is cold;</L>
<L>No <HI>Party</HI> I &s;erve, and no <HI>Pen&s;ion</HI> I hold.</L>
<L>We Hawkers are Men, and have Children and Wives</L>
<L>To comfort our Hearts and to &s;olace our Lives:</L>
<L>But if I &s;ay more, you'll think it is Stuff;</L>
<L>And <HI>a Word to the Wi&s;e is,</HI> in Rea&s;on, <HI>enough.</HI></L>
