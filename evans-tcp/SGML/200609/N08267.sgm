<P>THE following local piece, intitled, (<HI>The Di&s;ap|pointment, or the Force of Credulity</HI>) was ori|ginally wrote for my own, and the amu&s;ement of a few particular friends, who (unknown to me) were plea&s;ed to &s;ignify their approbation of it, in &s;uch a manner, that it &s;oon engro&s;&s;ed the chief part of the conver&s;ation of all ranks of people; who expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire to hear it, and have it publi&s;hed.&mdash;Under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, I was greatly at a lo&s;s how to proceed, I did not choo&s;e (as I &s;aw no merit in it) to expo&s;e it to the critici&s;ms of criticks, to put it in the pow|er of gentlemen skill'd in &s;chola&s;tick knowledge, to ri|dicule my ignorance, or conde&s;cend to the intreaties of tho&s;e, who I thought had no more &s;en&s;e than my&s;elf, and who might (perhaps) have made it better than it really is. Con&s;cious therefore of my own inability, I deter|mined to excu&s;e my&s;elf to all; and in this determination I per&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time, but at la&s;t, for my own &s;afety, was obliged to capitulate and &s;urrender on the follow|ing &s;tipulations; Fir&s;t, the infrequency of dramatic com|po&s;itions in America: Secondly, the torrent of &s;olicita|tions from all quarters: Thirdly, the nece&s;&s;ity of con|tributing to the entertainment of the city: Fourthly and la&s;tly, to put a &s;top (if po&s;&s;ible) to the fooli&s;h and pernicious practice of &s;earching after &s;uppo&s;ed hidden

In order to put their &s;cheme into execution, they fram'd a plau&s;ible, well connected &s;tory of hidden trea&s;ure; and to glo&s;s the matter, adapted &s;undry papers to their purpo&s;e, and pitch'd upon two &s;uitable old fellows, Wa&s;hball and Raccoon (as principle dupes) with others, to try the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;cheme; which had the de|&s;ired effect.&mdash; The moral &s;hews the folly of an over credulity and de&s;ire of money, and how apt men are (e&s;pecially old men) to be unwarily drawn into &s;chemes where there is but the lea&s;t &s;hadow of gain; and concludes with the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that mankind ought to be con|tented with their re&s;pective &s;tations; to follow their vo|cations with hone&s;ty and indu&s;try&mdash; the only &s;ure way to gain riches.</P>
