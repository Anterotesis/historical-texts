<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to write a book with|out imagination. This faculty is con|cerned with all our ideas;&mdash;it either in|invents or colours them. The philo&s;o|phers may &s;ay what they plea&s;e, but a &s;en|timent is good for little except the imagi|nation is concerned in it. It is the fancy which colours our &s;entiments, and makes them agreeable. And &s;entiments without being tinged a little with the colourings of imagination, will appear very dull and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>Things are not le&s;s real, becau&s;e the fancy colours them, and this journey is not le&s;s true, becau&s;e the imagination has had a &s;hare in it;&mdash;and there is not a &s;en|timental journey extant that would have exi&s;ted, if fancy had not woven a thread in the web of &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The critics will find &s;ome defects in the&s;e travels; but as every man has a right to travel in his own way, &s;o every critic has a right to find fault if he has a mind.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. A morning's adventure in pa&s;&s;ing over the river Tyne&mdash;The floating chariot&mdash;Ha&s;|&s;let's gho&s;t, or the &s;pirit of Gate&s;head-Fell.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a di&s;agreeable con&s;ideration when a per&s;on is enjoying &s;weet repo&s;e in his bed, to be &s;uddenly awakened by the rude blu&s;tering noi&s;e of a vociferous ho&s;tler. There is no help for it, provided a man
<PB REF="015918_0007_0F9B3DF6E1D3C270">
intends to travel in a &s;tage-coach; this evil, like many others, mu&s;t be &s;uffered with patience. Patience renders all bur|dens three fourths lighter than they would be without it.</P>
<P>The morning was very fine when we entered the coach; nature &s;miled around us. It is a pity, thought I, that we are not to ride on hor&s;eback; we &s;hould then enjoy the plea&s;ures of the morning, &s;nuff the perfumes of the fields, hear the mu|&s;ic of the groves, and the concert of the woods.</P>
<P>In cro&s;&s;ing the river Tyne from <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> there is one inconveni|ency: you mu&s;t wait the plea&s;ure of a lit|tle arbitrary Ba&s;haw, who will not move one foot beyond the rules of his own au|thority, or mitigate the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon tho&s;e who are condemned to travel in a &s;tage-coach within a ferry-boat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written before the temporary bridge was built.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As I hate every idea of &s;lavery and op|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="11" REF="015918_0008_0F9B3DF7ACC1AC10">
I was not a little offended at the expre&s;&s;ions of authority which were ex|erci&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, by the legi&s;la|tor of the ferry. We were now in the boat, and obliged to &s;it till this little ty|rant gave orders for our departure. The vehicle for carrying pa&s;&s;engers acro&s;s the river, is the mo&s;t tire&s;ome and heavy me|thod that ever was invented. Four row|ers in a &s;mall boat drag the ponderous fer|ry acro&s;s the river very &s;lowly.</P>
<P>From the time we entered the boat, before we landed on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, an hour was almo&s;t &s;pent. We had time to reflect upon what might happen to us by the way, and an opportunity to put up a few ejaculations to heaven, to pre|&s;erve us from the danger of ferry-boats and tyrants. This was the be&s;t u&s;e we could make of our time, while we conti|nued in this floating chariot; &s;ome of the ladies who were in the coach, were &s;o hurried in the morning, that they &s;carce|ly had time to &s;ay their prayers&mdash;This was a good opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="015918_0009_0F9B3DF85B7AD9E0">As &s;oon as we landed on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river <HI>Tyne,</HI> we were &s;aluted by a black-bird, which welcomed us to the county of <HI>Durham.</HI> It &s;eemed to take plea&s;ure to &s;ee us fairly out of the do|mains of <HI>Charon,</HI> and whi&s;tled chearfully upon our arrival. Nature, &s;aid I to my|&s;elf, is the mi&s;tre&s;s of real plea&s;ure; this &s;ame black-bird cannot &s;uffer us to pa&s;s by without contributing to our happine&s;s. <HI>It is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than receive.</HI> I wi&s;h that all men under&s;tood this maxim as well by rea&s;on and tutorage, as this whi&s;tler in a hedge does by in&s;tinct.&mdash; The black-bird is free, and &s;ings from a &s;en&s;e of liberty&mdash;it is under no controul&mdash; were it in a cage it might &s;ing, but not half &s;o &s;weetly.</P>
<P>Liberty appears to be the fir&s;t principle of mu&s;ic. Slaves can never &s;ing from the heart. The <HI>capons</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> which &s;la|very, by the in&s;truments of ca&s;tration, hath formed to &s;ing for the entertainment of arbitrary ma&s;ters, can never give &s;uch mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ions, as a free citizen, and
<PB N="13" REF="015918_0010_0F9B3DF92D779278">
and a &s;on of liberty. They may be fit to plea&s;e &s;laves or tyrants, but can never give true entertainment to a &s;oul that knows and values liberty.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Gate&s;head,</HI> and a&s;|cended the <HI>Fell,</HI> the plea&s;ures of the morning increa&s;ed upon us;&mdash;the whins and brier &s;ent forth a fragrance exceed|ingly delightful. On every &s;ide of the coach, peerle&s;s droops of dew dangling upon the blo&s;&s;oms of the thorns, helped to add to the pre&s;ume. Aurora began now to &s;treak the we&s;tern &s;ky, and the &s;pangled heavens announced the approach of the king of day.&mdash;The fine&s;t touch|es of the mo&s;t curious arti&s;ts, are but mean imitations of tho&s;e various colours which adorn the heavens at the approach of the &s;un. Sol at la&s;t appeared, and &s;pread his healthful beams over hills and valleys. The wild bea&s;ts now were retired to their dens; and tho&s;e timorous animals which go abroad in the night, to &s;eek their food, were al&s;o withdrawn to the thickets. The hares were &s;kipping acro&s;s the lawn,
<PB N="14" REF="015918_0011_0F9B3DF9E1A58A68">
ta&s;ting the dewy glade for their morning's repa&s;t. The &s;ky-lark mounted on high, and &s;erenaded his dame with mirthful glee and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>How pure are the feelings of nature? How &s;trong the power of in&s;tinct! The&s;e are not warped by the bias of fal&s;e educa|tion, cu&s;tom, or private intere&s;t. That &s;ame lark does all that is in his power to render his mate happy.&mdash;He &s;ings to make her toil ea&s;y, while &s;he is employed about their mutual concerns. Ah! little do tho&s;e about the courts of monarchs know, the power of the&s;e unmixed feel|ings. They are &s;trangers to the cha&s;te plea&s;ures which fill the &s;oul with unmix|ed joy. In&s;tead of nouri&s;hing and che|ri&s;hing their own fle&s;h, they imitate the vile&s;t of animals, in drinking &s;tolen wa|ters to gratify their lu&s;ts. Say, ye libidi|nous children of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, did your maker implant the&s;e de&s;ires in your na|ture? or have ye not rather by pur&s;uing evil practices acquired another nature than the Almighty endowed you with? For
<PB N="15" REF="015918_0012_0F9B3DFAE6748350">
&s;hame! do not blame your Maker for tho&s;e unnatural de&s;ires; he never implan|ted them in your con&s;titution. The lu&s;t remains in your mind&mdash;and you your|&s;elves have created it, by ta&s;ting too fre|quently of forbidden plea&s;ures. Blame not your fle&s;h, but your vile di&s;po&s;itions which you have acquired by the practice of vice, and formed into a habit. Say, if you have not the &s;ame de&s;ires to licentiou&s;ne&s;s&punc; when nature revolts again&s;t the practice? Then, your&s;elves, and not nature are to be blamed.&mdash;Go to the lark, ye &s;laves of pollution, con&s;ider his ways and be wi&s;e. &mdash;He cheri&s;hes his dame with all the &s;oft endearments of affection&mdash;He does not &s;troll through the grove or the thicket, to &s;earch for &s;ome new amour, but keeps &s;trictly to the ties of conjugal affection, and cheri&s;hes the partner of his natural concerns. Who but mu&s;t frown, to &s;ee a D&mdash;ke, L&mdash;d, or K&mdash;t, pur&s;uing a &s;trange woman, embelli&s;hed with a few trappings of foreign &s;ilk and lace, to a hou&s;e of plea&s;ure, where he receives with
<PB N="16" REF="015918_0013_0F9B3DFB57D05BF8">
his forbidden enjoyment, a &s;tain on his character a &s;ting for his con&s;cience, and rottenne&s;s to his bones&mdash;While &s;he to whom he &s;wore to be faithful, pines away at home in di&s;content and fretful &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Nature has provided for men all tho&s;e plea&s;ures which &s;he has formed di&s;po&s;iti|ons for the enjoyment of;&mdash;but the loo&s;e de&s;ires which libidinous mortals attribute to their natures, proceed from other cau&s;es&mdash;from a neglect of pur&s;uing the principles of nature, and from behaving unnaturally.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e contemplations, a grave and &s;olemn &s;cene opened to our view. <HI>Ha&s;slet</HI> that robbed the mail a|bout two years ago, hangs on a gibbet at our left hand&mdash;Unfortunate and infatu|ated <HI>Ha&s;slet!</HI> had&s;t thou robbed the na|tion of millions, in&s;tead of robbing the mail, and pilfering a few &s;hillings from a te&s;ty old maid; thou had&s;t not been hanging a &s;pectacle to pa&s;&s;engers, and a prey to crows. Thy ca&s;e was pitiable&mdash;
<PB N="17" REF="015918_0014_0F9B3DFC35D83DA0">
but there was no mercy&mdash;thou wa&s;t poor! and thy &s;in unpardonable. Had&s;t thou robbed to &s;upport the Crown, and mur|dered for the Mini&s;try, thou might&s;t have been yet alive. Were all the robbers of the nation hanging in the &s;ame &s;ituation, there would be &s;ome appearance of ju&s;tice and impartiality. But the poor only can com|mit crimes worthy of death,&mdash;and tho&s;e al&s;o mu&s;t be enemies to the Court, or lukewarm in its intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The place where <HI>Ha&s;slet</HI> hangs, is the fine&s;t place in the world for the walk of a gho&s;t.&mdash;At the foot of a wild romantic mountain, near the &s;ide of a &s;mall lake are his remains; his &s;hadow appears in the water, and &s;ugge&s;ts the idea of two male|factors.&mdash;The imagination may ea&s;ily con|jure up his gho&s;t. Many &s;pirits have been &s;een in wilds not &s;o fit for the purpo&s;e. This robber is now perhaps the genius of the <HI>Fell,</HI> and walks in the gloomy &s;hades of night by the &s;ide of this little lake. This is all &s;uppo&s;ition,&mdash;and is perhaps as good a &s;uppo&s;ition as any that has yet
<PB N="18" REF="015918_0015_0F9B3DFCD7962D70">
given for gho&s;ts and goblins becoming vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>This dreary place is well calculated for rai&s;ing gloomy ideas, which tend to craze the imagination.&mdash;It would not be won|derful to hear &s;ome vi&s;ionary mortals re|lating that they &s;aw <HI>Ha&s;slet</HI> walking by the &s;ide of the water. The imagination is capable of creating things which are not, and can upon &s;ome occa&s;ions quick|en the dead. Many travellers have &s;een things that are invi&s;ible, and affirmed what is as improbable, as that <HI>Ha&s;slet</HI> was &s;een walking upon the top of <HI>Gate&s;|head Fell.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A de&s;cription of the city of Durham&mdash;The Abbey&mdash;The Choir&mdash;The Clock&mdash;Rural Plea&s;ures&mdash;The female Antipodes&mdash;The Arbor&mdash;The Ca&s;cade&mdash;In&s;criptions up|on Grave-&s;tones.</HEAD>
<P>THE city of <HI>Durham</HI> is very plea&s;ant|ly &s;ituated. The river Ware, almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;es it round, and forms a penin|&s;ula. The banks of the river from <HI>Old Elvet Bridge</HI> to <HI>Framwell-gate,</HI> form a fine amphitheatre. The cathedral church of St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop's palace, which &s;tand upon the oppo&s;ite bank, af|ford a very grand pro&s;pect. The plea&s;ant banks on the we&s;t &s;ide, adorned with &s;tately trees, mingled with &s;hrubs of vari|ous kinds, bring to one's mind the roman|tic ideas of ancient &s;tory, when &s;wains and nymphs &s;ung their loves among&s;t trees, near the &s;ide of &s;ome inchanting river. The abbey and ca&s;tle call to remembrance tho&s;e inchanted places where knights errant
<PB N="20" REF="015918_0017_0F9B3DFE560607F0">
were confined for many years, till deliver|ed by &s;ome friend, who knew how to di&s;|&s;olve the chains and charms of necro|mancy.</P>
<P><HI>Durham</HI> would be a very fine place, were it not for the &s;warms of prie&s;ts that are in it,&mdash;who devour very exten&s;ive livings without being of any real &s;ervice to the public. The common people are here very ignorant, and great profaners of the &s;abbath-day. It is cu&s;tomary for the idle people to play at the long bowl on the Sunday when the weather is fair. In|deed, almo&s;t over all England, the great|e&s;t ignorance and vice is under the no&s;es of the Bi&s;hops. The rea&s;on hereof I will not pretend to &s;ay, but the fact is appa|rent.</P>
<P>This city is a very healthy place, the the &s;oil is dry, and the air whole&s;ome.&mdash; It is built upon a ri&s;ing ground, and the fields around it are plea&s;ant both in win|ter and &s;ummer. The &s;agacity of the monks appears con&s;picuous in the &s;ituati|on
<PB N="21" REF="015918_0018_0F9B3DFF28B278E8">
of <HI>Durham Abbey.</HI> It is placed in the neighbourhood of as fine land as any in England, and the greate&s;t part thereof now belongs to the dean and chapter. Were I to refer the choice of an e&s;tate to any per&s;ons what&s;over, it would be to the clergy;&mdash;they know the &s;oil of this world better than any denomination of mankind. Wherever they have taken up their re&s;idence, there is &s;ure to be found a fine &s;ituation, and a good &s;oil. The air in and about Durham being very whole|&s;ome, the inhabitants live to a good old age. It is a place of little trade or bu&s;i|ne&s;s, being far from the &s;ea, having no port nearer than <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> or <HI>Sunderland.</HI> Here are &s;ome manufactories, but they have not yet been carried to any great per|fection.</P>
<P>One thing which travellers admire mo&s;t in <HI>Durham,</HI> is the Cathedral, a grand and ancient building. In this church there is a very fine organ, and an excel|lent choir of &s;ingers; but devotion is per|formed here with great lukewarmne&s;s and
<PB N="22" REF="015918_0019_0F9B3E00157DC520">
indifference. The per&s;ons who are prin|cipally concerned in the acts of religious wor&s;hip, perform their parts rather as a grievous ta&s;k than a matter of choice.</P>
<P>This antient building is &s;upported by two rows of Gothic pillars, of which, &s;carcely any two of them are exactly alike. The architecture is very noble and ex|ceedingly delightful to the eye of any per|&s;on who has a ta&s;te for antiquity, or Go|thic magnificence. The font for bap|tizing children, &s;tands at the we&s;t end of the abbey, as in other churches, for which I know no other rea&s;on than <HI>&s;ic voluerunt Romani.</HI></P>
<P>On the &s;outh &s;ide of the abbey near the choir, &s;tands a very famous <HI>clock,</HI> &s;aid to be the workman&s;hip of a man who was convicted of counterfeiting the King's coin: he had no other method to &s;creen him&s;elf from ju&s;tice, than to throw him|&s;elf into the arms of the church, and do &s;omething meritorious to work out his own &s;alvation. He made this clock to the
<PB N="23" REF="015918_0020_0F9B3E0096616A78">
holy church, that he might obtain the pardon of his iniquity. He would have been as &s;urely hanged as ever <HI>Ha&s;slet</HI> was for robbing the mail, had he not taken &s;helter in this city of refuge. In tho&s;e days no power could touch an offender who fled for protection to the clergy;&mdash; whatever crime he might have commit|ted, if the church once received him un|der her protection, no other power dur&s;t interfere. Accordingly, this coiner made this clock for the good of the church; and it appears to be of more real &s;ervice to the abbey, than the bi&s;hop and the whole college of doctors. The clock is not only a mechanical oracle, but a kind of moral machine; for in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance it directs the eyes of a traveller to the things which are above; it exhibits a view of the planets and their motions, and &s;hews the variations of the moon; it points out the day of the month, and the moon's age, with &s;everal other curious exhibitions.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="015918_0021_0F9B3E05227F2958">The maker had certainly been a very ingenious per&s;on, and any good-natured man would almo&s;t forgive him the &s;in of coining, on account of the merit he has di&s;played in performing this noble piece of machinery. When we entered into the church, the moon had not fini&s;hed her fir&s;t quarter. I thought to my&s;elf, that this clock was certainly intended by the arti&s;t to teach the doctors the change|ablene&s;s of all created enjoyments, and to put them in mind of laying up their trea|&s;ure in heaven, where all fluctuation will cea&s;e, and all things continue in a &s;tate of permanency.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the cathedral, over again&s;t the clock, there is a monu|ment placed in the wall, with an in&s;crip|tion upon one Mr. <HI>Hartwell,</HI> who was once a clergyman in this church. Upon the top of the tomb-&s;tone the&s;e words are in&s;cribed,
<Q>The la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is death.</Q>
<PB N="25" REF="015918_0022_0F9B3E075EB004A0">
This in&s;cription, upon the very top of mortality, affords a noble rea&s;on of hope to tho&s;e who believe the New Te&s;tament, of a ble&s;&s;ed re&s;urrection to eternal life.</P>
<P>The tomb of St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI> is a curio&s;ity which is &s;hewn to &s;trangers. An old wo|man &s;hewed us where the pilgrims were wont to pay their homage to the &s;ame,&mdash; and if there is any truth in the Hi&s;tory of St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> they have left the marks of their feet behind them; the flag is worn hollow with the ceremony of obei&s;ance. I ob&s;erved to the old woman, that when this &s;aint ro&s;e, it would make a &s;trange cata&s;trophe, and &s;poil the devotion of the doctors; &s;he had no notion of a re&s;urrec|tion, but &s;tared with wild &s;urprize; I en|deavoured to in&s;truct her a little in this important point of religion, but to no manner of purpo&s;e;&mdash;for &s;he neither un|der&s;tood, nor was willing to under&s;tand, any thing of the matter.</P>

of the college of doctors;&mdash;for they are all very learned men, and preach many learned &s;ermons, which this good woman might hear if &s;he had a mind. The rea&s;on why this female door-keeper of the hou&s;e of God, was &s;o ignorant of the doctrine of the re&s;urrection of the dead, appeared to me to be, that &s;he did not think her&s;elf obliged to believe it, be|cau&s;e it is not in the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church,&mdash;which is all that a member of the church of England is con|cerned to believe.</P>
<P>After we were wearied with &s;auntering in this old Gothic abbey, we went down to the river &s;ide, to view the curio&s;ities in the fields. The large and exten&s;ive banks of the river are all planted with trees, at the foot of which is a fine gravel walk, where the ladies and gentlemen amu&s;e them&s;elves in the forenoon before dinner, and in the afternoon before tea. Here a per&s;on who is fond of rural plea&s;ures, may riot at large. The river glides plea|&s;antly by the &s;ide of the banks, and in va|rious

In &s;ummer, birds of various kinds make a rural concert, more entertaining to a &s;entimental traveller, than all the mu&s;ic of the cathedral which &s;tands on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river. The&s;e chori&s;ters of the grove &s;ing from the heart, and expre&s;s the feelings of nature in a pure manner; &mdash;while the hirelings in the abbey, wea|ried with their ta&s;k, perform their parts by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, without feeling the power of the mu&s;ic they expre&s;s.

<P>As we were walking on the &s;ide of the river, we had a con&s;picuous view of the <HI>Antipodes.</HI> I had often heard of them in books of geography, but never &s;aw them before. It was ju&s;t a little before dinner, that we walked along the foot of the bank towards <HI>Old Elvet</HI> church, when we &s;pied three young ladies walking up|on their feet, with their heads downmo&s;t. They were Antipodes to us, and appeared to be taking a little fre&s;h air before din|ner. They had all the appearance of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ladies, but walked in a quite dif|ferent direction from tho&s;e who travel on our hemi&s;phere. It &s;eemed natural to conclude, that the Antipodes in all parts
<PB N="29" REF="015918_0026_0F9B3E0BFAF33B78">
of the globe are like to one another; for the Antipode Ladies at <HI>Durham</HI> are as like tho&s;e in the city of <HI>London,</HI> as la|dies po&s;&s;ibly can be like to each other. Whether there is a chink in the globe in this place, by which the oppo&s;ite people become vi&s;ible to one another, or that we &s;aw only &s;ome phantoms, I &s;hall leave for a gue&s;s to my readers,&mdash;but one thing I am &s;ure of, that a worthy &s;urgeon, and a captain of a &s;hip, were witne&s;&s;es of this phenomenon. I was ready at fir&s;t to imagine, that the three ladies were &s;ome of the remains of the antient fairies, who in days of yore are &s;aid to have played many droll pranks,&mdash;by fri&s;king &s;pee|dily from one place to another, and fre|quently turning them&s;elves into &s;trange attitudes;&mdash;but as none of them were dre&s;&s;ed in green, I concluded they were the Antipodes, and totally gave up the la&s;t hypothe&s;is. I was afraid le&s;t the &s;ur|geon, a young man, and unmarried, &s;hould have made a precipitate de&s;cent into the river, and gone down to the re|gion

of Antipodes; for the captain, who is a judge of fine women, &s;poke &s;o much in their prai&s;e, that he would have kind|led the flames of love in the heart of our fellow traveller, had not a cloud &s;pee|dily removed them out of our &s;ight, and delivered the &s;urgeon from any fur|ther temptation.

<P>Near to the place where we were fa|voured with this beatific vi&s;ion, there is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant natural arbours that the eye can behold. Five &s;tately a&s;h trees formed into a &s;ort of &s;emicircle, twi&s;ted round with ivy, make a very de|lightful arbor;&mdash;and to add to the plea|&s;ure of this retreat, from the &s;corching beams of the &s;un, there is a ca&s;cade at a &s;mall di&s;tance, where the water tumbling down a huge precipice, breaks into foam

<P>We came at la&s;t to <HI>Old Elvet</HI> church|yard, and walked a &s;hort while among the dead.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. An account of the characters in the coach&mdash; A di&s;pute concerning a &s;tanding army&mdash; The theory of mobs&mdash;The eclairci&s;&s;ement.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we left <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> the coach was full;&mdash;four ladies, a gentle|man of the &s;word, and your humble &s;erv|ant,
<PB N="33" REF="015918_0030_0F9B3D5AC058F570">
made up the principal contents of this &s;tage vehicle. We &s;at in &s;ilence for a &s;hort time, till we were jolted into good humour by the motion of the coach,&mdash; when the &s;everal &s;ocial faculties began to open. One of our female companions, who was a <HI>North Briton,</HI> a jolly middle aged matron, and a lady of abundance of good &s;en&s;e and humour, entertained us for a quarter of an hour, with the hi&s;tory of her travels. She had made the tour of <HI>Europe,</HI> and had vi&s;ited the mo&s;t remark|able places in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> in quality of a dutiful wife attending her valetudinary hu&s;band, who was travelling for the re|covery of his health. Her ea&s;y unaffect|ed manner in telling a &s;tory, made her ex|ceeding good company, and none of us had the lea&s;t inclination to interrupt her, till &s;he plea&s;ed to cea&s;e. She knew how to time her di&s;cour&s;e, and never, like ma|ny of her &s;ex, degenerated into tediou&s;|ne&s;s or in&s;ipidity. At every &s;tage &s;he was a conformi&s;t to all the mea&s;ures of the company, and went into every &s;ocial pro|po&s;al
<PB N="34" REF="015918_0031_0F9B3D627482B408">
that was made. As &s;he is the mo|ther of four fine daughters, in giving us the outlines of their hi&s;tory, &s;he puzzled us with a &s;ort of enigma, which &s;he was obliged to explain before we could under|&s;tand her meaning. They were married, &s;he &s;aid, in four different kingdoms, all belonging to King <HI>George</HI> the Third, and yet there were none of them either in <HI>Hanover, Wales,</HI> or in any of the colo|nies. There was one of them, &s;he &s;aid, in <HI>England,</HI> whom &s;he was going to &s;ee; another in <HI>Ireland,</HI> two in <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash; The&s;e la&s;t appeared to us to be in one and the &s;ame kingdom, and we could not de|vi&s;e a third;&mdash;but by holding to an old di&s;tinction, and divi&s;ion of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;he made out two kingdoms in that part of the i&s;land. One of tho&s;e ladies was mar|ried in the kingdom of <HI>Fife,</HI>&mdash;&s;o the enigma was explained.</P>
<P>Another of our companions was a wi|dow lady in <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> quite as agreeable as the former. She under&s;tood how to
<PB N="35" REF="015918_0032_0F9B3D63D46C7848">
make us laugh, and could tell a &s;tory as well as mo&s;t of her &s;ix;&mdash;yet far from being trouble&s;ome or tedious, &s;he rather excited our inclination to have her conti|nue, than end her di&s;cour&s;e. She only went with us for one &s;tage, and then we lo&s;t the plea&s;ure of her company.</P>
<P>The third was a <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> lady, well known in the literary world for her u&s;e|ful performances for the benefit of youth. This female triumvirate would have been much upon par, had they been all tra|vellers, for their gifts of communication were much alike; but the lady who had taken the tour of <HI>Europe,</HI> had made &s;eve|ral u&s;eful ob&s;ervations upon foreign places, which the others were not acquainted with;&mdash;the&s;e rather gave her an advant|age, which mu&s;t be attributed to circum|&s;tances, and not to the want of abilities in her companions.</P>
<P>The la&s;t female was the <HI>Scotch</HI> lady's &s;ervant,&mdash;and as &s;he &s;aid nothing the whole way, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of her.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="015918_0033_0F9B3D63E7B9C4F0">The fifth of our companions was an officer in the army, who in the morning appeared very drow&s;y, and came forth of his chamber with a &s;ort of reluctance. His hair was di&s;hevelled, and quite out of queu, and he &s;eemed to be as ready for a &s;leep as if he had not been in bed. He was for a time as dumb as a quaker, when not moved by the &s;pirit, and by continu|ing in &s;ilence, at la&s;t fell a&s;leep, till we had proceeded near the half of our fir&s;t &s;tage. During this time he &s;aid no ill.</P>
<P>We fini&s;hed our fir&s;t &s;tage, without ex|changing many words with this &s;on of <HI>Mars,</HI> except &s;ome of tho&s;e flim&s;y com|pliments which the gentlemen of the &s;word pay frequently to the ladies, when they mean nothing. After a di&s;h of warm tea had warmed his bowels, and &s;uppled the fibres of his tongue, he began to let us know that he was an officer in the ar|my, and a man of &s;ome con&s;equence. He &s;eemed to be fond of war, and &s;poke in high terms upon the u&s;efulne&s;s of a &s;tand|ing
<PB N="37" REF="015918_0034_0F9B3D64A392EF00">
army. When he had exhau&s;ted his whole fund of military arguments, in be|half of &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion; I ob&s;erved to him, that a &s;tanding army had a bad appearance in a free country, and put it in the power of the crown to en&s;lave the nation;&mdash;that in&s;tead of being under a civil government a nation was under a military one, when &s;oldiers were let loo&s;e upon the &s;ubjects for every &s;mall di&s;cord which happened between oppre&s;&s;ors and tho&s;e whom they oppre&s;&s;ed;&mdash;and that I thought the militia was &s;ufficient to an|&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of a &s;tanding army. I likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that in&s;tead of en|couraging a &s;tanding army, I would ad|vi&s;e all my friends again&s;t being &s;oldiers, becau&s;e that as &s;oon as they commenced &s;oldiers they became &s;laves for life.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, the &s;pirit of <HI>Mars</HI> be|gan to &s;tir in him, and he threatened, that if he was near a ju&s;tice of the peace he would have me fined for hindering him from getting recruits;&mdash;adding that he once had a man fined five pounds for per|&s;uading
<PB N="38" REF="015918_0035_0F9B3D676BC10CC0">
others not to enli&s;t in his Maje&s;|ty's &s;ervice. I told him, he certainly had a right to &s;ay all the fine things he could to recommend the &s;ervice of his ma&s;ter; and when he had done all that he could to recommend his &s;ervice, he had no more to do:&mdash;but, that any man had al|&s;o a right to tell his friends whom he &s;aw ready to be &s;educed into bondage, that they were born free, and ought to take care how they give up their liberty.&mdash; However, if any per&s;ons were di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;laves, I &s;hould not hinder them, other|wi&s;e than by &s;hewing them the rights of human nature, and the evils which at|tended bondage. I affirmed, that all &s;y&s;|tems of government where a man was not tried by his peers, were no better than tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, and contrary to the principles of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution; that the military government was of that &s;ort, becau&s;e a court of officers pretended to have authority to di&s;po&s;e of a private man's life and liberty, when he was not guilty of any crime, that the laws of his country would condemn him for; and
<PB N="39" REF="015918_0036_0F9B3D6896ED6A50">
which in other per&s;ons was not accounted criminal.&mdash;That court martials were no|thing but arbitrary tribunals, oftentimes compo&s;ed of officers, who, if they were private men, would receive the &s;ame &s;en|tence which they pa&s;&s;ed upon others, and de&s;erve it better than the poor helple&s;s culprits who fall a &s;acrifice to their pride and caprice. I further told him, that <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> had affirmed in his <HI>Commenta|ries upon the Laws of England,</HI>
<Q>That the laws and con&s;titution of the&s;e king|doms know no &s;uch &s;tate as that of a perpetual &s;tanding &s;oldier, bred to no other profe&s;&s;ion than that of war;&mdash; and that it was not till the reign of king <HI>Henry</HI> VII. that the kings of <HI>England</HI> had &s;o much as a guard about their per&s;ons.</Q></P>
<P>To convince this &s;on of <HI>Mars,</HI> that a &s;tanding army, as di&s;tinct from the peo|ple, is incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, I told him that <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> had ob&s;erved from <HI>Monte&s;quieu,</HI>
<Q><PB N="40" REF="015918_0037_0F9B3D691AAAB8A0">That to prevent the executing power from being able to oppre&s;s, it is requi|&s;ite that the army with which it is en|tru&s;ted &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of the people, and have the &s;ame &s;pirit with the people; as was the ca&s;e of <HI>Rome,</HI> till <HI>Marius</HI> new modelled the legions by enli&s;ting the rabble of <HI>Italy,</HI> and laid the foun|dation of the military tyranny which en&s;ued. Nothing then, according to the&s;e principles, ought to be more guarded again&s;t in a free &s;tate, than making the military, when &s;uch a one is nece&s;&s;ary to be kept on foot, a body di&s;tinct from the people. It &s;hould wholly be compo&s;ed of natural &s;ubjects; it ought only to be enli&s;ted for a &s;hort and limited time; no &s;eparate camps, no barrack, no inland fortre&s;s &s;hould be allowed.&mdash;And perhaps it might &s;till be better, if by dimini&s;hing a &s;tated number, and enli&s;ting others, at every renewal of their term, a circulation would be kept up between the army and the people, and the citizen and
<PB N="41" REF="015918_0038_0F9B3D6A24404218">
&s;oldier be more intimately connected together.</Q></P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to make a military man under&s;tand any thing without the limits of his own &s;y&s;tem; all laws, except what belong to a court martial are nothing to him. Our companion under&s;tood not a &s;ingle word of either <HI>Monte&s;quieu</HI> or <HI>Black&s;tone</HI>; all his laws were connected with the &s;word, and may properly be call|ed club laws.</P>
<P>I did not find, however, that our mili|tary protector was a blood-thir&s;ty man, for by his own confe&s;&s;ion, he and another brother officer, had a few months before &s;urrendered their pur&s;es to an highway|man between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Highgate,</HI> for fear of blood&s;hed. This &s;hews that &s;ome officers are abundantly peaceable in time of danger, and declare no inclination for taking away mens lives. Our gentleman of the &s;word had a great many &s;olid rea|&s;ons why men &s;hould not venture their lives for a little money: he &s;aid there was no courage in fighting an highwayman,
<PB N="42" REF="015918_0039_0F9B3D6B007026F0">
nor any honour to be had in the victory; that &s;oldiers &s;hould pre&s;erve their lives for the &s;ervice of their country in ca&s;e of war, and not run the ri&s;k of lo&s;ing them by fooli&s;h adventures.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons did not altogether &s;atisfy the ladies;&mdash;for one of them ob&s;erved, that robbers were at war with both laws and government, and that the king's &s;erv|ants were hired to keep the peace, and to defend the &s;ubjects from violence; and that officers in the army are as much obliged by their office and character to fight robbers, as they are bound to fight the <HI>French,</HI> or any other enemy. That foot pads were invaders of other people's rights and properties, and ought to be re|&s;i&s;ted by men who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it was to fight, and who were well paid for &s;o do|ing; that it was for money all the officers in the army &s;erved the King, and fought his battles, and why &s;hould they not as well fight for money in a &s;tage-coach, as in a ca&s;tle or in a field? She in&s;i&s;ted that only one of them could have been killed by the highwayman, or perhaps but
<PB N="43" REF="015918_0040_0F9B3D6B709C7928">
wounded, and there were &s;everal chances that he might have mi&s;&s;ed them both.&mdash; But &s;uppo&s;ing the wor&s;t, that one had been &s;hot, it was only the chance of war, and the other might have &s;ecured the robber,&mdash;which would have been of more &s;ervice to the community than the life of the officer. In &s;hort, &s;he ob&s;erved, that it had more the appearance of cowardice than di&s;regard for money, for two officers to &s;urrender their pur&s;es to a &s;ingle high|wayman, who had nothing but one pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>The lady's reflections were &s;everely felt by our young &s;wordman, and pro|duced a &s;olemn &s;ilence in the coach for a quarter of an hour,&mdash;during which time &s;ome of us fell a&s;leep, and continued in that &s;tate till we came to the inn where we were to change hor&s;es. Two or three gla&s;&s;es of port re&s;tored the officer's cou|rage, and he was determined, in ca&s;e we were attacked, to defend us from the a&s;|&s;aults of all highwaymen what&s;oever;&mdash; and to &s;hew that it was not for want of courage that he &s;uffered the highwayman to e&s;cape, he told us a pretty diffu&s;ive &s;to|ry
<PB N="44" REF="015918_0041_0F9B3D6C18A6D250">
of his own valour in quelling a mob at <HI>Dumfries.</HI></P>
<P>Some hungry people in the town of <HI>Dumfries,</HI> who were not di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tarve, when there was plenty of provi&s;ions in the hands of the farmers and corn-factors, a&s;&s;embled in a body to do them&s;elves ju&s;|tice, and to endeavour to have &s;omething to eat. The magi&s;trates who thought that the people had a right to &s;tarve, and were not di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in re|lieving their nece&s;&s;ities, &s;ent for a party of military men to oblige them either to fa&s;t di&s;creetly, or to be &s;hot, to ea&s;e them from the cravings of nature and the pains of hunger. Our hero was &s;ent upon this expedition, and had the command of the party;&mdash;where he performed wonders, all which we received upon the authority of his own te&s;timony. The poor people were &s;hot at like woodcocks, and tho&s;e who could get away with &s;afety, were glad to return home to wre&s;tle with hun|ger, and the hard demands of their appe|tites, till heaven &s;hould think fit to pro|vide
<PB N="45" REF="015918_0042_0F9B3D6CD4C81950">
for them. This was a hard ca&s;e, but there was no help for it; authority enforced by powder and ball, is not ea&s;i|ly re&s;i&s;ted. The mob, to be &s;ure, are ca|pital tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, when they will not live without food, which they have no right to ta&s;te, unle&s;s they are able to pay for it, according to the price that mono|polizers and ingro&s;&s;ers &s;et upon it.&mdash;And it is, to be &s;ure, the duty of magi&s;trates to protect traders in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what&s;oever they can obtain, but they have no concern with the nece&s;&s;ities of the poor, who are no benefit to &s;ociety. The modern meaning of authority, is to protect the rich, and to keep the poor in &s;ubjection; for every body knows, that tho&s;e who have no money can have no law; and without an exorbitant expence, no poor man can &s;ecure his right when oppre&s;&s;ors are dipo&s;ed to di&s;pute it.</P>
<P>Our young officer was very liberal in abu&s;ing tho&s;e whom he called the mob, and &s;aid they were ignorant, ob&s;tinate, and wicked; and added, that he thought it no crime to de&s;troy hundreds of them.
<PB N="46" REF="015918_0043_0F9B3D6D9D877A90">
The lady who before had given him a lecture, began to put him in mind of the foot-pad whom he and his brother offi|cers had &s;uffered to e&s;cape with their pur&s;es, and a&s;ked him how he would quell a mob of highwaymen? He was off his guard, and the mentioning of the foot-pad made him &s;tare with a &s;ort of wildne&s;s, as if the robber had been at the coach door. The conver&s;ation ended, and I made the following remarks upon it.</P>
<P>That all tyrants are either cowards, or under the influence of the &s;pirit of mad|ne&s;s. Tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to en&s;lave or tyrannize over others of their fellow-creatures, will always behave meanly un|der a rever&s;e of fortune: Such as &s;hew any degree of bravery, do it more from the influence of madne&s;s, than from any true principle. Tyrants who oppre&s;s others, have more rea&s;on to dread tho&s;e whom they oppre&s;s, than the oppre&s;&s;ed have to dread them; and they who are in perpetual fear, are perpetual cowards. Such as do not fear them whom they op|pre&s;s, mu&s;t be in a &s;tate of lunacy.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="015918_0044_0F9B3D6E68D7EEC0">Secondly, the condition of the &s;ubjects is very mi&s;erable, when they are not able to purcha&s;e the provi&s;ions which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for life, and dare not take them without danger of the gallows. It is a great grievance to hungry people, to be|hold a number of large &s;tacks of corn, and yet cannot obtain as much as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport life. It is a terrible al|ternative to fa&s;t and &s;tarve, or eat and be hanged. What are mobs and riots in times of &s;carcity? but hungry people fighting for their meat. The full, the rich, and wealthy, who&s;e intere&s;t it is to have the prices of the nece&s;&s;aries of life high, may call them rebels, or by what names they plea&s;e; but if they would change circum&s;tances for a &s;mall &s;ea&s;on, they would &s;oon alter their opinion.</P>
<P>Rebellion, is not a principle which rules in the hearts of the poor, it is to be found chiefly among the rich.&mdash;There are not any among the poor tribes of mankind who do not pay the greate&s;t regard to their &s;overeign, and would, if there were occa&s;ion, venture their lives in his &s;ervice;

but they are not able to endure hunger, for the belly has no ears. Is there no other way of pacifying hungry people, than to cram powder and ball down their throats? Ah ye who riot in the mid&s;t of plenty, little do ye know how hard it is to endure hunger. There would be nei|ther mobs nor riots, provided tho&s;e who have more than they have occa&s;ion for, would di&s;po&s;e of their &s;uperfluities to tho&s;e who are in di&s;tre&s;s. They are rebels a|gain&s;t his Maje&s;ty's government who &s;eek to &s;tarve his people. The principal re|bels are neare&s;t the purlieus of the court. His Maje&s;ty has not better &s;ubjects than the manufacturing and labouring part of the people, and the&s;e are now obliged to &s;uffer hunger&mdash;and al&s;o to endure the reproach of bad names. It is ea&s;y for a glutton of a mini&s;ter to call his betters the &s;cum of the earth, and to hire &s;crib|blers to abu&s;e them; but what ju&s;tice or mercy in this practice? Such behaviour to his Maje&s;ty's be&s;t &s;ubjects, mu&s;t cer|tainly happen without his knowledge!</P>
<P>Thirdly, all nations are near their down|fall,
<PB N="49" REF="015918_0046_0F9B3D70225F35A8">
when their internal peace is to be kept by a &s;tanding army. Mutual love is the only thing that can &s;upport a com|munity; when the one half di&s;tre&s;&s;es the other, and endeavours to keep them in &s;ubjection by force and compul&s;ion, a di&s;|&s;olution mu&s;t inevitably follow.</P>
<P>Fourthly, when the army, under the authority of the crown, is compo&s;ed of the worthle&s;s part of the community, they become a di&s;tinct &s;ociety by them&s;elves, and will be ready to do any &s;ervice to en|&s;lave the nation; being de&s;titute of all principles of honour or hone&s;ty, for a &s;mall hire, they will perform as many ar|bitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive acts as they expect to be rewarded for; and will con&s;ider the injuries which they do the nation, as no|thing more than advantages taken of a|nother community. Wherever &s;uch an army is, they will always con&s;ider them|&s;elves as in an enemy's country, and pay no regard to the inhabitants. They know that they are hated, and for that rea&s;on act towards all men as if they were ene|mies. <HI>Rome</HI> was fir&s;t en&s;laved by an ar|my

<P>When we had ended our altercation, the officer and the re&s;t of the company came to an eclairci&s;&s;ement, and in&s;tead of repeating grievances or finding fault with one another's profe&s;&s;ion, we agreed for the re&s;t of the journey to admit of <HI>non|conformity,</HI> and &s;uffer every one to di&s;&s;ent when they plea&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Doctrine of Steeples&mdash;The We&s;t Indian &mdash;Reflections upon it.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing which travellers &s;ee in approaching to large towns, is ge|nerally &s;peaking, the <HI>church &s;teeples.</HI> As they are ordinarily higher than the re&s;t of the buildings, they are on that account more con&s;picuous. There is a pretty high &s;teeple at <HI>Grantham,</HI> which &s;alutes your eyes at a great di&s;tance before you ap|proach the town. It &s;eems to be of the pyramidical kind; when we fir&s;t perceiv|ed it, a que&s;tion was &s;ugge&s;ted to me,&mdash; and perhaps as nece&s;&s;ary to be re&s;olved as many in the <HI>Athenian</HI> oracle.&mdash;But
<PB N="52" REF="015918_0049_0F9B3D7762A01708">
as it belongs chiefly to the bi&s;hops and their clergy, I will not undertake to an|&s;wer it. It is neither mathematical, phy|&s;ical, mechanical, logical, nor moral: it appears to me to be entirely eccle&s;ia&s;tical. For the benefit of the clergy I &s;hall ju&s;t propo&s;e it. What is the rea&s;on that the greate&s;t part of church &s;teeples are for the mo&s;t part built at the we&s;t end of churches?</P>
<P>If I was to build a church, but I hope I never &s;hall, I &s;hould certainly rear the &s;teeple upon the ea&s;t end hereof.&mdash;For as the highe&s;t winds in this i&s;land gene|rally blow from the we&s;t, in ca&s;e the &s;tee|ple &s;hould be blown down, the church would be &s;afe:&mdash;while tho&s;e churches which have their &s;teeples upon the we&s;t end, if they &s;hould chance to fall by the violence of the we&s;t wind, would endan|ger the whole fabric, and perhaps &s;poil the devotion of the congregation, if it &s;hould fall upon a <HI>Sunday</HI> or an <HI>holy day.</HI> For this rea&s;on it would be right, when there is &s;ome mention of reforming the
<PB N="53" REF="015918_0050_0F9B3D78172D74D8">
church, to begin with reforming the &s;teeples.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t undoubtedly have been an ar|ticle of the church in antient times with regard to &s;teeples, that they &s;hould be all built upon the we&s;t end of the edifice. If this is really the ca&s;e, it removes all dif|ficulties, and affords a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the practice; for as the judgment of the clergy determines the &s;en&s;e of all things eccle&s;ia&s;tical, if it was their will to have &s;teeples built in that manner, it is rea&s;on &s;ufficient. <HI>Sic voluerunt Clerici,</HI> is as good a rea&s;on as can be given for any article of the church. I &s;hall leave the full di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of this material part of church di&s;ci|pline to the bi&s;hops and their clergy.</P>
<P>As the &s;un was a good way up when we came to <HI>Grantham,</HI> we had &s;ome time to take a view of it. The captain and I went &s;auntering through the town. 'Tis a plea&s;ant place, but the hou&s;es are indif|ferently built.&mdash;We &s;aw nothing of any con&s;equence to mention in this journal. After we had wandered through the town,
<PB N="54" REF="015918_0051_0F9B3D78E0AF62C8">
we came in to &s;upper, when the captain took care to &s;ay &s;ome civil things to our landladyes &s;i&s;ter, who is a very hand&s;ome young woman. It was ea&s;y to perceive that &s;he was acquainted with tho&s;e civi|lities, and could di&s;tingui&s;h between truth and fal&s;hood. She made the captain keep his di&s;tance in &s;uch a manner, as put an end to his civilities. The fine|ne&s;s of her per&s;on, and the beauty of her complexion, were joined with a mode&s;t &s;e|verity, that protected her from the rude|ne&s;s and in&s;ults which gentlemen think them&s;elves entitled to u&s;e towards a cham|bermaid, which was the character &s;he acted in.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, we were informed, that &s;ome of Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s &s;ervants were that night to exhibit in an old thatched hou&s;e in a corner of the town. They had come abroad during the &s;ummer vacation, to &s;ee if they could find any thing to keep their grinders going till the opening of <HI>Drury-lane Theatre.</HI> They were that night to play the <HI>We&s;t-Indian,</HI> with the
<PB N="55" REF="015918_0052_0F9B3D79A0789B58">
<HI>Jubilee,</HI> and we determined to &s;ee them perform. The actors played their parts very indifferently, but one could perceive as much meaning in their performance, as to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between an hone&s;t man and a rogue. I &s;hould be very much afraid in per&s;onating the old ra&s;cal, of a &s;olicitor too often, of becoming &s;ome|thing more than an imitation. It is not good to try experiments of this &s;ort often, le&s;t the habits of roguery &s;hould become predominant. But the generality of play|ers have little morality to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;cenes were tolerably good, tho' the hou&s;e was extremely bad;&mdash;and the actors made a &s;hift to go through with the play as well as could be expected. The fine&s;t &s;ight that we &s;aw in this hou&s;e, which was very crouded that night, was a fine collection of ladies and gentlemen. I que&s;tion if any town of the &s;ame &s;ize in <HI>England</HI> can produce &s;uch a number of fine women. They were all in general both &s;tately and beautiful;&mdash;not tawdry and tarni&s;hed like &s;ome fine ladies in the metropolis; nature had given them com|plexions
<PB N="56" REF="015918_0053_0F9B3D7A6195A418">
which needed no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from art, and their native &s;implicity greatly ad|ded to their beauty. I was exceedingly well plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch a number of young men and women in good health and good &s;pirits. There was no clapping during the time of the play, though I am per&s;uaded, had it been performed in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> the actors would have been clapped continually;&mdash;but the people of <HI>Gran|tham</HI> follow nature, and only clap when they feel. The whole of this night's work was over by eleven, and the compa|ny di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; when we returned to our lodging. Our time and that of the au|dience, might have been better employed, than in &s;eeing a few &s;tupid rogues endea|vour to imitate what &s;ome of them real|ly were.</P>
<P>After our return I began to reflect up- the characters in the play, and the per|formance of the &s;everal actors; as I had not a play-bill, I did not know the names of the players.&mdash;He who performed the part of old <HI>Varland</HI> the &s;olicitor, &s;eem|ed to act mo&s;t naturally. It is more ea&s;y to
<PB N="57" REF="015918_0054_0F9B3D7B1C244110">
imitate vice than virtue, thought I; and one of the company &s;ugge&s;ted, that the player who acted old <HI>Varland</HI> mu&s;t have been a rogue him&s;elf, otherwi&s;e he could not have entered &s;o well into the &s;pirit of the character.</P>
<P>The play it&s;elf has &s;ome good charac|ters in it, which are tolerably well drawn; though I could wi&s;h for the &s;ake of <HI>Old England,</HI> that <HI>Fulmer</HI> and his wife had not been in it. Major <HI>O Flarherty</HI> is an excellent character, and was tolerably well &s;upported, but tho&s;e who pretend to know the players &s;ay, that he who &s;u&s;tained this character, was only an imitator of Mr. <HI>Moody.</HI></P>
<P>The writer of the <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> has un|doubtedly drawn his characters with judgment, but it is not &s;o ea&s;y to find ac|tors. Loo&s;e, abandoned, di&s;&s;olute per|&s;ons, will never be able to &s;upport the characters of <HI>Stockwell</HI> and <HI>O'Flaherty</HI>; and yet the greate&s;t part of our players are both loo&s;e in their &s;entiments, and immo|ral in their lives. Lady <HI>Ru&s;port</HI> is &s;uch
<PB N="58" REF="015918_0055_0F9B3D7BE77CBFD8">
a character as is fit to create abhorrence in the mind of every tender hearted per|&s;on; to act &s;uch a character is a ta&s;k fit for the Devil, for no woman who de|&s;erves the name of a human being, is a|ble to act it properly, or make a good imitation. If there are any &s;uch old la|dies in <HI>England,</HI> I heartily wi&s;h for the honour of the nation, that they were all out of it.</P>
<P>Nothing plea&s;ed me more in the whole play, than the di&s;covery which Major <HI>O'Flaherty</HI> made concering the will in fa|vour of <HI>Charles Dudley.</HI> The characters of Mi&s;s <HI>Ru&s;port</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Dudley</HI> are well &s;upported in the play, but I was not able to &s;ay &s;o much in behalf of the actors.</P>
<P>The farce was intolerable, and notwith|&s;tanding all the travelling to the <HI>Jubilee</HI> by per&s;ons of all ranks, the performance can never afford entertainment to men of under&s;tanding. But it is now time to conclude this chapter, and proceed on our journey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. A new theory of &s;leep&mdash;The cau&s;e thereof&mdash; The anatomy of the brain&mdash;The nece&s;&s;ity of taking breakfa&s;t&mdash;Doctor Law's opi|um.</HEAD>
<P>WE left <HI>Grantham</HI> at two o'clock in the morning, which was much too &s;oon, con&s;idering how little &s;leep we had got the preceding night.&mdash;But there was no help for it,&mdash;we were under authority, and were obliged to obey. A per&s;on who has paid three pounds eight &s;hillings and &s;ix pence at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> for a &s;eat in the &s;tage-coach, will be a fool to lo&s;e it if he can help it&mdash;But if he cannot ri&s;e early in the morning, no one will wait upon him, or return him his money.</P>
<P>We were all in the coach at two,&mdash;and the driver went off as fa&s;t as if he would have driven us to <HI>Stamford</HI> in the twink|ling of an eye. As &s;oon as we were fair|ly out of the town, I fell a&s;leep.&mdash;And perhaps you will &s;ay, what is that to us? what indeed.&mdash;It is nothing but what
<PB N="60" REF="015918_0057_0F9B3D7D6B16F9B0">
every per&s;on does every night,&mdash;and &s;ometimes every day&mdash;unle&s;s when your lord&s;hips are at a ma&s;querade, or &s;ome &s;uch like godly employment; and then you are obliged to turn the day into night. So far the argument is in my favour. Ar|gument! what have arguments to do with &s;leep? More than &s;leep has to do with arguments,&mdash;for it will hear none, when it comes upon a per&s;on,&mdash;but takes po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his &s;en&s;ations at once, and renders him an imitation of death.</P>
<P>I dare venture to lay an equal wager, that there is not one who ever travelled in a &s;tage-coach can tell what I am go|ing to &s;ay next concerning &s;leep. For all what <HI>Rohault</HI> and <HI>Boerhaave</HI> have &s;aid up|on this &s;ubject, it will be ea&s;y to prove that they knew no more about the mat|ter, than one of the &s;even &s;leepers.&mdash;</P>
<P>For in the fir&s;t place, they never &s;aw it,&mdash;in the &s;econd place, they never &s;mel|led it,&mdash;and in the next place, they never heard it.&mdash;Now without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of the&s;e &s;en&s;es, how could they
<PB N="61" REF="015918_0058_0F9B3D7E1C0AF868">
know what it is? It is impo&s;&s;ible they could &s;ee it,&mdash;for it clo&s;es the eyes, and &s;huts the windows of the human frame. It is impo&s;&s;ible they could hear it, for it makes no noi&s;e, and comes &s;ilently upon a per&s;on unawares.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible they could &s;mell it, for it is no body;&mdash;and it is a very improper way of &s;peaking to &s;ay, that they could ta&s;te or feel it,&mdash;for it &s;eems chiefly to con&s;i&s;t of negatives. It is a &s;ort of want of feeling and &s;en&s;ation; for no &s;ooner does a man &s;ee, hear, feel, ta&s;te, and &s;mell, than he is awake.</P>
<P>If an anatomi&s;t were to try an experi|ment, to find out the cau&s;e or re&s;idence of &s;leep, he would as &s;urely waken a man as ever he was wakened in his life;&mdash;and this would &s;poil the whole experiment. Now Doctors <HI>Monro, Hunter, Hew&s;on,</HI> and all the lecturers upon anatomy, know no more about &s;leep, than a &s;leeping man does.&mdash;And the rea&s;on is, they never ana|tomized the brain of a &s;leeping man,&mdash; till they do this, without awakening or killing him, I will not e&s;teem them any better judges than other people.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="015918_0059_0F9B3D7ED7EF4220">All we have to proceed upon is hypo|the&s;is, and the mo&s;t probable hypothe&s;is mu&s;t certainly be be&s;t.&mdash;</P>
<P>When a man is &s;earching after an hy|pothe&s;is, he is like one who is in &s;earch of the philo&s;ophers &s;tone.&mdash;He tries this experiment, and the other experiment,&mdash; forms this propo&s;ition, and the other pro|po&s;ition, and pur&s;ues them through all the modes and figures of logic; and when he can find nothing to &s;ay again&s;t it him&s;elf, he concludes that nobody el&s;e can, and &s;o determines it to be right.</P>
<P><HI>Rohault</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>That &s;leep con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;carity of the animal &s;pirits which flow into the nerves, whereby the nerves are &s;hut up, and bring on &s;leep.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Boerhaave</HI> defines &s;leep,
<Q>to be that &s;tate of the medulla of the brain, where|in the nerves do not receive &s;o copious, nor &s;o forcible an influx of &s;pirits upon the brain, as is required to enable the organs of &s;en&s;e and voluntary motion to perform their functions.</Q>
Now neither
<PB N="63" REF="015918_0060_0F9B3D80011081B8">
of the&s;e hypothe&s;es are certainly true.&mdash;It is all gue&s;s work;&mdash;and by con&s;idering the attributes of &s;pirits, we may form ano|ther hypothe&s;is entirely new.</P>
<P>It is the motion of the animal &s;pirits which keeps us awake, by playing tricks with our nerves,&mdash;whether we con&s;ider them as tubes or &s;trings.&mdash;If they are tubes, tho&s;e little &s;pirits mu&s;t blow in them like a trumpet or a pipe, and then we are kept awake by wind mu&s;ic;&mdash; if they are cords or &s;trings, then we are kept awake by vibration, by the &s;pirits playing upon our nerves as upon a fiddle. As long as the&s;e invi&s;ible beings are di&s;|po&s;ed to play upon our nerves, we are kept awake; but when they cea&s;e, then we fall a&s;leep. Is it not then a very na|tural inference, that &s;leep is no more than the &s;pirits taking a re&s;t.</P>
<P>The next thing to be con&s;idered in a <HI>&s;tage-coach,</HI> is the cau&s;e of &s;leep; and it is a very natural inference from what has been ob&s;erved, that the cau&s;e of &s;leep is
<PB N="64" REF="015918_0061_0F9B3D806CEC55F0">
the wearine&s;s of the animal &s;pirits. To play con&s;tantly upon the fine&s;t of mu&s;ical in&s;truments what&s;oever, will produce wearine&s;s at la&s;t. It is a labour which cannot always be &s;u&s;tained without &s;ome relaxation;&mdash;for which cau&s;e the &s;pirits mu&s;t re&s;t occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e invi&s;ible beings re&s;t voluntarily or involuntarily, I will not pretend to &s;ay. And indeed, as I am only &s;peaking by hypothe&s;is, I may be &s;aid to determine nothing. Nor can any per&s;on determine certainly how the &s;pirits behave in time of &s;leep, till &s;ome of the adepts in anatomy di&s;&s;ect a &s;leeping &s;ubject, and then we &s;hall have an experiment which will afford the be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t evi|dence, and the highe&s;t degree of certainty.</P>
<P>It is an unea&s;y circum&s;tance in the way of &s;leep, when the foot falls a&s;leep fir&s;t; for this di&s;gu&s;ts the re&s;t of the &s;pirits which are performing their functions, and makes them fall foul upon the lazy ones, which give over their employment;&mdash;and in the struggle between the lazy ones and
<PB N="65" REF="015918_0062_0F9B3D8758FE8770">
tho&s;e which are at work, a man's leg is like to be torn to pieces.</P>
<P>The &s;horte&s;t definition of &s;leep is, that "it is a God;" this was the <HI>Romans</HI> opinion of &s;leep, who generally deified tho&s;e powers which they could not ac|count for.&mdash;The <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> take the contrary method; for they will not admit of any invi&s;ible power to be di|vine, unle&s;s they can perfectly account for it. Whether the <HI>Romans</HI> were wi&s;er than the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or not, I &s;hall not &s;ay, but it is manife&s;t they were more pious.</P>
<P>Be &s;leep what it will, it is &s;o powerful, that no per&s;on can re&s;i&s;t its energy;&mdash; there is a &s;ort of omnipotence in &s;leep. It can bind philo&s;ophers, fools, giants, he|roes, and cowards, &s;o fa&s;t with its chains, that they will lie as &s;till as if they were dead.</P>
<P>As &s;ome phy&s;iologi&s;ts have affirmed, that &s;leep lodges principally in the brain, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the in&s;ide

<P>As Doctor <HI>Wallis</HI> is too tedious, and <HI>Win&s;low</HI> and the re&s;t of anatomi&s;ts, are too prolix to copy, I &s;hall take a way of mine own, in developing the contents of the human brain-ca&s;e.&mdash;I promi&s;e to make no u&s;e of Latin or Greek words, but &s;hall endeavour to reduce the brain to pure <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; for, with the leave of the fa|culty, I &s;ee no rea&s;on in the world why an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>'s brain &s;hould always be rendered into Greek or Latin. When a|natomi&s;ts di&s;&s;ect the brain of a Roman or a Greek, they may u&s;e the language which that brain has been accu&s;tomed to, but when they touch an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>'s &s;cull, they ought to &s;peak and write plain <HI>En|gli&s;h.</HI></P>

The pious mo|ther embraces her children in her bo&s;om, and kindly &s;upports them.&mdash;The hard or &s;trong mother, which is &s;o called, becau&s;e &s;he defends the brain from the &s;evere pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;cull, and pre&s;erves it from violence, is likewi&s;e of great &s;ervice to the brain in &s;ome other re&s;pects. This may be called the grand mother of the brain, &mdash;the other the true mother.</P>
<P>Between the&s;e two mothers, there is a membrane, which is called the &s;pider's web.&mdash;This is de&s;igned for catching in|telligences, in the &s;ame manner that cob|webs catch flies. When once an idea is entangled in this &s;ubtil net, unle&s;s it is as &s;trong as a bee or a wa&s;p, it is impo&s;&s;ible it can get away again.&mdash;It mu&s;t remain there to add to the food of the brain, till it be dige&s;ted into a propo&s;ition.&mdash;When two ideas are catched here, they make a a propo&s;ition, but if three happen to be apprehended, then they form a &s;yllogi&s;m in the brain.</P>
<P>Were it not for this &s;pider's web, ideas

<P>This intellectual trap is not in all per|&s;ons the &s;ame,&mdash;for in &s;ome brains it catches the ideas, of points, lines, &s;uper|ficies, triangles, &s;quares, circles, cones, and cylinders.

<P>In &s;ome, this brain-trap catches no|thing but ideas of ver&s;es, and articles of poetry:&mdash;Gods and Godde&s;&s;es, flames and darts, are &s;towed &s;o thick, that &s;carce|ly one idea of common &s;en&s;e can get li|berty to enter.

This arch is a marrowy body; it has its ri&s;e from the fore part of the&s;e little bellies, with two roots which join together, and run|ning towards the back part, they divide into parts called the legs of the arch. In the ba&s;is of the&s;e two little bellies, are four heights;&mdash;the two foremo&s;t are called the furrowed bodies, the other two go by the name of the beds of the eye nerves. Beyond the&s;e, there are two pro|jections called the <HI>buttocks,</HI> and under them, two called the <HI>witne&s;&s;es.</HI> Above the buttocks, there is a gland called the <HI>pine-apple,</HI> where &s;ome have alledged the &s;oul re&s;ides.&mdash;But this I leave to the learned.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="015918_0068_0F9B3D8DF82A72D0">Upon the beds of the eye nerves, there are a number of blood ve&s;&s;els, glands and water ducts, called <HI>the work in form of a chorus.</HI> Under the beginning of the <HI>arch,</HI> is a &s;mall hole, called the <HI>bore,</HI> or pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>feet of the arch,</HI> or <HI>the way to the funnel</HI>; and under the middle of the <HI>arch</HI> there is one called the <HI>back-hole,</HI> which is covered with a valve, called the great val|ve.

<P>The <HI>&s;pinal marrow</HI> is another thing contained within the human brain-ca&s;e.

a traveller de&s;ire to keep awake, he mu&s;t take his breakfa&s;t to &s;trengthen his &s;pirits.</P>
<P>There are only two ways to keep a per|&s;on awake, when he &s;ees no vi&s;ible dan|ger;&mdash;either to make him very hungry, and then the &s;pirits will turn frantic and fight &s;leep,&mdash;or to take all the rea&s;onable &s;upplies which nature requires to &s;upport them in a regular manner.</P>
<P>As the animal &s;pirits are re&s;trained from their u&s;ual exerci&s;e by &s;leep,&mdash;and as the&s;e invi&s;ible beings have been di&s;covered to act in matter, &s;o Dr. <HI>Law</HI> and others have conjectured that the rational &s;pirit mu&s;t al&s;o fall into a &s;tate of inactivity, as &s;oon as the organs of &s;en&s;ation are unfitted for the &s;oul to act upon. When therefore the &s;y&s;tem of &s;en&s;ation fails, the action of the &s;oul (which they con&s;ider to depend as much upon the &s;en&s;es, as waking de|pends upon the free exerci&s;e of the ani|mal &s;pirits) cea&s;es, till a new &s;y&s;tem of &s;en&s;ations be re&s;tored to it.&mdash;And there is no certainty from any principles of phi|lo&s;ophy,

that ever there &s;hall be any more cogitation, if the &s;oul fall a&s;leep at death.</P>
<P>This is but a dreary idea, and philo&s;o|phy cannot help us out of this gloomy difficulty.

<P>IN a fine &s;ummer afternoon, when you come over <HI>Highgate-Hill,</HI> you may &s;ee <HI>London.</HI>&mdash;In a &s;tage-coach you have on|ly
<PB N="76" REF="015918_0073_0F9B3D922007A560">
a peep at it. There is, &s;aid I, a nation of &s;teeples in <HI>London.</HI>&mdash;It mu&s;t be a won|derful holy place, there are &s;o many churches in it.&mdash;The &s;un &s;hone upon the windows, and what we &s;aw appeared to advantage.&mdash;It is a very fine place to be &s;ure, otherwi&s;e there would not &s;o many go to it.</P>
<P>The fields between <HI>Highgate</HI> and <HI>Lon|don,</HI> are naturally plea&s;ant, but they were now parched for want of rain, not a &s;in|gle &s;hower had fallen around <HI>London</HI> for &s;ix weeks&mdash;the fields were burnt up, and there did not appear to be a mor&s;el of gra&s;s for either hor&s;e or cow.

place is <HI>London,</HI> thought I to my&s;elf&mdash;It is a large place&mdash;a rich place&mdash;and a wicked place; it was all conjecture, for I never &s;aw it before. "What &s;ort of a place is St. <HI>James</HI>'s?" It is the King's palace&mdash;"Do we &s;ee it yet" &s;aid I to our companions? they an|&s;wered, no.</P>
<P>I proceeded in my conjectures.&mdash;
<Q>Perhaps <HI>London</HI> is four times as large as <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI></Q>
&mdash;it is ten times as large&mdash; it is far too large.
<Q>Is it a walled town? are the walls high?</Q>
There are no walls at all.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of my conjectures we reached <HI>London</HI>&mdash;We are in the city now, &s;aid I,&mdash;not yet replied the offi|cer, who had a mind to contradict me.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. General ob&s;ervations upon <HI>London</HI>&mdash;Me|lancholy&mdash;The cau&s;e thereof in <HI>London</HI>&mdash; Banking the way to Heaven.</HEAD>
<P>THE people in <HI>London</HI> are va&s;tly di&s;|creet to tho&s;e who bring money with them, and a&s;k nothing from them.&mdash; They naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e who come only for a few weeks, have no fa|vours to a&s;k, and are very glad to &s;ee them. They are &s;ometimes mi&s;taken, for tho&s;e who come from the country have their own ends in vi&s;iting the metropolis; and more come with a view to advantage, than merely for plea&s;ure. Pure and re|fined plea&s;ures are not to be met with in large cities. They may be enjoyed in greater perfection in the country.</P>
<P>When a &s;tranger comes into &s;uch a ci|ty as <HI>London,</HI> he will naturally con&s;ider the characters of the inhabitants; but if he was as wi&s;e as <HI>Solomon,</HI> he could not de&s;cribe the character of the <HI>Londoners.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="015918_0077_0F9B3D9A4514C418">
They are not of one, but a thou&s;and cha|racters. Some are civil and kind; &s;ome are rude and uncivil;&mdash;others are haugh|ty, and &s;ome are humble.&mdash;<HI>London</HI> is an abridgment of the world&mdash;whatever is &s;aid of the world, may be &s;aid of it.&mdash; I wi&s;h there was no rea&s;on to &s;ay, that it lies in wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>London</HI> is a place of trade; the inhabi|tants are chiefly engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s; but if it was not &s;upplied from the country, in half a century it would be very thin of people. Tho&s;e that are born in <HI>London,</HI> are generally weak and puny, and tho&s;e who come to re&s;ide in it, grow every day weaker than they were when they came to it.&mdash;It is the &s;ame in all large towns.</P>
<P>Compliments are carried to great per|fection in this great city; I wi&s;h hone&s;ty was carried as far; but it is impo&s;&s;ible for hone&s;ty to &s;tay where there is much bu&s;i|ne&s;s.&mdash;This is no reproach to <HI>London,</HI> for <HI>Babylon, Tyre,</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> were &s;o be|fore it, and company takes away the edge of reproach.&mdash;Mankind &s;eldom are a|&s;hamed,
<PB N="81" REF="015918_0078_0F9B3D9AAFCCDCB8">
while they have multitudes to keep them in countenance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coachmen</HI> in <HI>London</HI> are hone&s;t, and the rea&s;on is, they dare not be other|wi&s;e; there is a law which enjoins puni&s;h|ment for them, if they fail in point of hone&s;ty.&mdash;Forced hone&s;ty is better than none; for though it does no good to &s;uch as are hone&s;t for fear of puni&s;hment, yet it does good to the community&mdash;The gallows is good for &s;ome purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>In <HI>London,</HI> as in all great towns, noble actions are oftner done through o&s;tentati|on, than from a principle of truth; but as this city is compo&s;ed of a great variety of characters, this motive is &s;tronger or weaker, according to the habits which individuals have acquired before they came there, or the influence which cu&s;|tom has upon the tempers of particular characters.</P>
<P>The merchants in <HI>London</HI> have the art of &s;etting off all things to the be&s;t advant|age; the goods in their &s;hops are full as
<PB N="82" REF="015918_0079_0F9B3D9B621FFA28">
good as tho&s;e in their warehou&s;es. If they are not better, nobody can blame them.&mdash;A trader always makes the be&s;t of his window; and if it were not for the fine windows, the <HI>Print&s;ellers</HI> might &s;hut up their &s;hops. It is not &s;afe, however, to &s;top to look at their windows; for they are too often crouded with thieves,&mdash; and you are in danger of having your pockets picked.</P>
<P>The <HI>Book&s;eller</HI>'s &s;hop is the bank of au|thors; for none el&s;e in <HI>London</HI> pay the lea&s;t regard to genius. They endeavour, however, to &s;erve them&s;elves fir&s;t, by making a good bargain,&mdash;and they may be &s;aid to live upon the brains of authors.</P>
<P><HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> is one of the fine&s;t places in the city, but if there were fewer &s;hops in it, there would be more trade; it &s;eems to be over-&s;tocked, which impoveri&s;hes the merchants; the bu&s;ine&s;s of the linen draper &s;eems to be pa&s;t its meridian.</P>
<P>The <HI>Barbers</HI> in <HI>London</HI> are all &s;abbath breakers; they &s;have and dre&s;s upon the
<PB N="83" REF="015918_0080_0F9B3D9C2C8523F8">
<HI>Sunday,</HI> when the people will let them, which is generally as often as they come. The &s;hop-keepers have adopted the <HI>Ma|caroni</HI> heads, and are at as much pains with their heads, as with their &s;hops. If they endeavoured to mend their hearts, they would find the advantage of it; for it would be a means of keeping them from cheating, to which they have many temptations.</P>
<P>The we&s;t end of the town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of idle people, who have nothing to do, and on that account are prone to do ill. The principal manufacturers of vices lodge there; and it would be hap|py for London if nobody had any com|munication with them.&mdash;But then the &s;uperfluities would not &s;ell; they are therefore obliged to encourage &s;in for the &s;ake of trade.</P>
<P><HI>St. James's Park</HI> is a very fine place, but I have &s;een an hundred as fine places in the country. Remove the King's pa|lace and the court twenty miles from it, and it would be no better than many other fields about London.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="015918_0081_0F9B3D9CE1F859A0">When I came to <HI>London,</HI> I thought the plague had been in the city, or the King was dead; for all the people had di&s;tre&s;s in their countenances. Melancholy had over&s;pread the town, but raged mo&s;t a|bout the Exchange. The <HI>bulls</HI> and <HI>bears,</HI> like the dogs in <HI>Homer,</HI> were fir&s;t &s;eized with this plague, which began in <HI>Change Alley.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;trong was the force of this melan|choly, that it was fit to bri&s;tle the beard of a <HI>Jew.</HI> One would have thought that the whole town had ju&s;t come from the tabernacle, or had been within a few paces of purgatory; the mu&s;cles of their faces were &s;o &s;everely di&s;torted, that they looked as if they had &s;een an apparition, or had been frightened by the Devil.

<P>The rea&s;on of this appeared to be, that they had not laid up their trea&s;ure in heaven, but had given it into the hands of the banker; who in&s;tead of returning

them their own with u&s;ury, had hidden their talents in the earth, &s;o that none of them could find their money, but lo&s;t both &s;tock and intere&s;t.&mdash;</P>

It is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible to every created power&mdash;It is a mercy it is not impo&s;&s;ible to God!&mdash;It is a maxim which will hold in general, though there are &s;ome exceptions again&s;t it, that <HI>tho&s;e who have mo&s;t money, have lea&s;t mercy.</HI>&mdash; If it were not &s;o, there would be few poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people.&mdash;Tho&s;e who give to the poor, lay up their trea&s;ure in hea|ven, and can never loo&s;e their money, if the Scriptures are true.&mdash;But what have the Scriptures to do in ob&s;ervations upon <HI>London</HI>? what indeed! Scripture will not &s;ell; it is a &s;tale commodity, and does not an&s;wer to the book&s;ellers.&mdash;We &s;hall pa&s;s it over then, and conclude this chap|ter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Ob&s;ervations upon windows&mdash;Remarks up|on the police of <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHAT a great number of fine win|dows is there in <HI>London</HI>?&mdash;but they are as well paid for&mdash;the tax upon window-light comes high. The poor as well as rich feel this impo&s;ition. We talk of <HI>Liberty,</HI> but when we have not the free u&s;e of light, it does not look as if we were very free. The wi&s;dom of the le|gi&s;lature is not to be que&s;tioned, but it is hard to lay &s;uch a heavy tax upon what nobody can want. It &s;mells rank of either di&s;tre&s;s in the government, or a de&s;ign to oppre&s;s. We mu&s;t charitably &s;uppo&s;e the fir&s;t, for to &s;uppo&s;e the latter would be to blame the mini&s;try, which mu&s;t not be allowed.&mdash;It is, and it plea&s;e your high|ne&s;&s;es, very hard for poor people not to have liberty to peep at the Sun, the moon, or the &s;tars, without a prodigious expence. But how can it be helped? If it plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters, to lay the tax
<PB N="88" REF="015918_0085_0F9B3D9FE9E03700">
upon painted ladies and loo&s;e women&mdash; There are perhaps as many in <HI>London</HI> as there are windows,&mdash;or if there are fewer, advance the taxation.</P>
<P>But this would be &s;till hard upon the town&mdash;The &s;hop-keepers would not be able to keep mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and the mini&s;|try would have to pay as well as the re&s;t, which would not be fair. However, there is no fairne&s;s in taxing light&mdash;for it is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and no per&s;on can want it who have eyes to &s;ee.&mdash;Suppo&s;e a per&s;on was to chu&s;e to live in a hou&s;e without windows, there is rea&s;on to fear they would tax his door, or lay an impo|&s;ition upon his darkne&s;s, for his candles are taxed already. There is &s;omething unju&s;t al&s;o in the mode of taxing win|dows,&mdash;the <HI>quantity of light,</HI> and not the number of windows &s;hould be taxed. There are &s;ome windows as large as ten, why is not the tax in proportion? Op|pre&s;&s;ion advances by a gradual motion.&mdash; <HI>Ovid</HI> tells us that the world was once a common.&mdash;

<P>The ground was as free as the &s;un and the air.&mdash;But now the world is divided, and the light and the air taxed;&mdash;and the divi&s;ions are not very equal, nor the taxes very light.</P>
<P><HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> in a fine &s;ummer day, is a place of great concour&s;e;&mdash;a great num|ber of heads are to be &s;een in the &s;treets, and they are all taxed.&mdash;They mu&s;t un|doubtedly bring a great &s;um of money to &s;ome place or other, and fill &s;ome peoples pur&s;es.</P>
<P>Perhaps there are &s;even hundred thou|&s;and heads in <HI>London,</HI> which pay two-pence a piece; this will amount to five thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty three pounds.&mdash;A goodly &s;um for liberty for men to u&s;e their heads. This to be &s;ure is for the good church, which ought not to be grudged.&mdash;But then there is al&s;o two-pence for &s;moke, and fourpence for
<PB N="90" REF="015918_0087_0F9B3DA15A2C1A90">
bread and wine at <HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI>&mdash;All this will make near eleven thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix pounds; for which the peo|ple have no &s;atisfaction, and the govern|ment no real advantage.</P>
<P>Some will be ready to &s;mell <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> from this reflection, and cry
<Q>the church is in danger.</Q>
&mdash;And &s;he ought to be in danger, when &s;he devours &s;o much money which might be better applied. Ah! the&s;e petitioners will never re&s;t till they bring in a <HI>root and branch petition</HI>; and where is the harm of that? People in the&s;e dear times are obliged to take all methods to &s;ave money. And if it plea&s;e your reverences, you would do the &s;ame thing your&s;elves, provided the Lord would turn it to your intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Police</HI> in <HI>London</HI> is very good, and the government of the watermen on the river <HI>Thames</HI> is al&s;o tolerable.&mdash;No per&s;on will impo&s;e upon you, provided you know the rules, and put them in mind of the laws. The coach-hire is all &s;ettled, and &s;o exactly, that a few yards will bring you

in for one &s;ix-pence more.&mdash;There is no <HI>free grace</HI> among coachmen&mdash;you mu&s;t pay for every inch of your way.</P>
<P>The city of <HI>London</HI> is full of lamps at night, and the watch is &s;et at eight o'clock, and continues till the morning light. The watch-men in <HI>London</HI> are the mo&s;t in&s;ig|nificant creatures I ever &s;aw.&mdash;Some of them are &s;carcely able to walk&mdash;a great number of them are old &s;uperannuated per&s;ons, who can only &s;it in a box, and look at tho&s;e who pa&s;s by.&mdash;And if there is any truth in reports, there are a num|ber of them kept in pay by the ladies of the town. Tho&s;e who keep good hours in <HI>London,</HI> are in no danger; as for others they mu&s;t abide the con&s;equences. Con|&s;idering the largene&s;s of the place, and the great concour&s;e of people, <HI>London</HI> is better than could be well expected. Any per|&s;on may live very happy in <HI>London,</HI> pro|vided they have money, and are di&s;po&s;ed to live peaceably&mdash;and if they are inclined to do bu&s;ine&s;s, they may have wherewith to live upon.</P>

<P>FOR a per&s;on to be in <HI>London,</HI> and not &s;ee St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, is next to impo&s;&s;ible. He may &s;ee the &s;teeple before he comes near it;&mdash;and he hears &s;o many extra|ordinary &s;tories of its height and great|ne&s;s, that his curio&s;ity is wonderfully ex|cited before ever he approaches it.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to &s;ay, that St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s church is five hundred feet in length, and from the marble pavement to the cro&s;s on the top of the cupola, three hundred and forty feet high.&mdash;It is both high enough, and long enough, in all con&s;cience.</P>
<P>What is very remarkable in this large con&s;ecrated pile of building, there is but a &s;mall part of it devoted for public wor&s;hip. The re&s;t is a lobby for people to divert
<PB N="93" REF="015918_0090_0F9B3DA45C168188">
them&s;elves in, and for loo&s;e people to make a&s;&s;ignations. There is a good or|gan in this church, and a choir of &s;ingers, who &s;ing tolerably well, but not extraor|dinary. Public wor&s;hip is performed here in &s;uch a manner, as any &s;ober per|&s;on would believe that the wor&s;hippers were infidels. The per&s;ons concerned, appear either no way intere&s;ted in their acts of devotion, or divert them&s;elves during the time in a &s;candalous manner. They would play a <HI>comedy</HI> better than perform religious wor&s;hip&mdash;Indeed their whole performance has more the appear|ance of a farce, than devotion. Public wor&s;hip is al&s;o but ill attended here;&mdash; except tho&s;e who&s;e livings depend upon their religion.&mdash;Scarcely any el&s;e ap|pear, except &s;trangers who come out of curio&s;ity. If &s;trangers were to judge of the truth of religion, from the behaviour of tho&s;e who profe&s;s it in this place, they would certainly conclude, that it was a fiction, and of no real &s;ervice to mankind.</P>
<P>There are a few door-keepers who ex|po&s;e St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>church</HI> to &s;ale every day in

the year.&mdash;You cannot have the privilege of &s;eeing the gallery or the &s;teeple, with|out paying at every door you approach. What one &s;ees, is well worth the money; but it appears mean for chri&s;tians to pro&s;|titute their church for gain. In the very time of divine &s;ervice, you may have the attendance of a church officer, to &s;hew you all the curio&s;ities about the cathedral.</P>
<P>Upon the top of the &s;teeple, you have a fine view of <HI>London.</HI>&mdash;I know no place where it is &s;o well &s;een at one view. The hou&s;es appear from hence to be &s;mall in|&s;ignificant huts, and the people like pig|mies. The <HI>whi&s;pering gallery</HI> is a great curio&s;ity,&mdash;you can hear a man who is &s;o kind as to give you an ab&s;tract of the hi&s;|tory of this church in whi&s;pers, at a great di&s;tance, when you would think that he was &s;peaking very loud.&mdash;But tho&s;e who have read <HI>Maitland</HI>'s hi&s;tory of <HI>London</HI> will need no information concerning this building.</P>
<P>This cathedral is a grand piece of ar|chitecture, and <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren</HI> de&s;erved a patent for building churches.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="015918_0092_0F9B3DA5FADDFDF8">It is reckoned a great meanne&s;s for a per&s;on to be in <HI>London,</HI> and not to vi&s;it the court, and &s;ee the King.&mdash;I was under a nece&s;&s;ity to avoid this imputation, to take a trip to the court to &s;ee their maje&s;ties. The ideas of tho&s;e who have never &s;een a court, nor have had the op|portunity of &s;eeing crowned heads, are ready to make them too &s;anguine in their expectations.&mdash;The &s;tories which they read in news-papers concerning his <HI>&s;acred Maje&s;ty,</HI> their <HI>Highne&s;&s;es the Princes of the blood,</HI>&mdash;and the <HI>honourable Secretaries of State,</HI> make them expect to &s;ee &s;ome|thing very extraordinary.&mdash;They are rea|dy to imagine, that kings and queens are not like other men and women, but of an higher rank of beings.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty and the Queen came from <HI>Kew</HI> about half pa&s;t one o'clock, and I watched carefully to have a peep at them in their coming out of the coach. I was in as good a &s;ituation as could be wi&s;hed for.&mdash;I no &s;ooner &s;aw his Maje&s;ty, than the old maxim in the law of <HI>England</HI> came to my remembrance, <HI>that the King
<PB N="96" REF="015918_0093_0F9B3DA6A055B1D8">
can do no wrong.</HI>&mdash;I am &s;ure, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, if the King cannot, the Queen will not do any wrong. She &s;eemed ex|ceedingly well plea&s;ed, and appeared to &s;mile upon the &s;pectators with a great de|gree of affability.&mdash;I wi&s;hed that his Ma|je&s;ty had done the &s;ame. Whether the little wag the <HI>Prince of Wales</HI> had been calling <HI>Wilkes and Liberty</HI> that morning or not, and had di&s;plea&s;ed our <HI>gracious Sovereign,</HI> I will not pretend to &s;ay,&mdash; but I thought he &s;eemed not to be plea&s;|ed. I wi&s;hed him his health, and a long pro&s;perous reign&mdash;but he did not hear me, for I &s;aid it inwardly. <HI>Vive le Roi,</HI> thought I again, and may his Maje&s;ty have cau&s;e to be better plea&s;ed the next time I come to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>There were none there, that wi&s;hed him greater pro&s;perity than I did.&mdash;Fir&s;t, I wi&s;hed, that he might be pre&s;erved from the bad advice of all &s;elfi&s;h mini&s;ters.&mdash; Secondly, that he might always live and reign in the e&s;teem of his people.&mdash;Third|ly, that he might always be, and &s;eem well plea&s;ed, when his &s;ubjects came to
<PB N="97" REF="015918_0094_0F9B3DA79EE38050">
&s;ee him.&mdash;And, la&s;tly, that his Queen and his family might pro&s;per, and that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> might never want a prince of the <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> line, who was both able and willing to rule the nation according to the laws of the con&s;titution. If the&s;e are bad wi&s;hes, I am ready to beg his Maje&s;ty's pardon.</P>
<P>Having &s;tood a little at the door, we at la&s;t went up to the lobby, to &s;ee the great people pa&s;s along to pay their re&s;pects to their Maje&s;ties, where we &s;aw the amba&s;|&s;adors of <HI>France, Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI> They were ju&s;t like other men, only they had more &s;ervants, and a&s;&s;umed a great deal of &s;tate.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome poor noblemen, and a number of pen&s;ioners, who came al&s;o to make their court to his Maje&s;ty, pro|bably to have their &s;alaries enlarged, or at lea&s;t continued.&mdash;By all means let them have &s;ome &s;mall matters.&mdash;I cannot en|dure the thought of &s;ending away beg|gars without giving them &s;omething.&mdash; But if it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, thought I
<PB N="98" REF="015918_0095_0F9B3DA814AFAF50">
to my&s;elf, keep them out of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> and do not lead them into temp|tation to betray the intere&s;ts of their country.&mdash;Seeing they are beggars, do not place them upon hor&s;eback, le&s;t they ride to the &mdash;. If beggars have wherewith to live upon&mdash;there is no rea&s;on why they &s;hould <HI>rule a nation.</HI></P>
<P>The next thing which I was fond to ob&s;erve, was the ladies of the court.&mdash; What a falling off was here! except her Maje&s;ty, there was not one that was worth the looking at. The famous Mi&s;s <HI>Ver|non</HI> was there, the &s;i&s;ter of the cha&s;te la|dy <HI>Gro&s;venor.</HI> I had heard of her being the toa&s;t of the town, and the &s;tar of the court.&mdash;But one of the ladies of <HI>Grant|ham</HI> would out&s;hine a regiment of &s;uch beauties. People indeed differ in their opinion; courtiers do not follow nature, but plain people do. A painted woman may plea&s;e a courtier, which a clown would de&s;pi&s;e. A fine woman will ne|ver improve at court, unle&s;s &s;he imitate the Queen.&mdash;There was more of nature
<PB N="99" REF="015918_0096_0F9B3DAB820ED330">
and plain &s;implicity in her Maje&s;ty, than about any woman I &s;aw in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>There was a very droll &s;ort of a crea|ture which had come to court among the re&s;t, I could not learn her name, but &s;he had all the appearance of a <HI>London Doll,</HI> with a death's head upon it: Her eyes were &s;unk in her head, her no&s;e was pro|minent, and inclined at the end like the bill of a kite; her cheeks were &s;ticking to the bone, her teeth were too large for her lips, her chin was peaked like the &s;nout of a pig, and her brow was furrow|ed with wrinkles.&mdash;She had, however, a very large fardingal, and was dre&s;&s;ed like a girl of eighteen,&mdash;for which cau&s;e I took her for an old maid. My compa|nion and I thought that we had enough of the court for one day, and &s;o we came away.</P>
<P>After walking four or five miles in <HI>Lon|don</HI> in a hot &s;ummer's day, thir&s;t is ready to &s;corch a man's jaws.&mdash;A draught of porter is of great &s;ervice on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion.&mdash;We left the King, the Queen,
<PB N="100" REF="015918_0097_0F9B3DADF57885B8">
and the court, and went into the fir&s;t beer-hou&s;e we could &s;ee. A draught of beer had a good effect upon us; it refre&s;hed our &s;pirits, and put us in trim for walk|ing. We were as happy with our porter, as any of the court could po&s;&s;ibly be with Madeira or Champaigne. It was very good, and we were very thir&s;ty, which made us reli&s;h it the better.</P>
<P>We proceeded in our way together.&mdash; My friend would have called a coach, but I was determined to have none.&mdash;Two &s;hillings in <HI>London</HI> is as well in a man's own pocket, as in that of a coachman. Money is always nece&s;&s;ary, and
<Q>two &s;hillings may be of &s;ervice another time,</Q>
&s;aid I to my companion.</P>
<P>We parted and I went on to <HI>Hackney.</HI> It was by this time three o'clock, and I began to wi&s;h earne&s;tly for my dinner. I had no occa&s;ion to wi&s;h when I came there; it was as ready as I could have wi&s;hed it. I was engaged to dine with a clergyman there, who entertained me very kindly, and with a great deal of ho&s;pita|lity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. A meeting of the Clergy at the <HI>King's-head Tavern</HI> in the <HI>Poultry</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> a great Entertainment.</HEAD>
<P>THERE happened to be an a&s;&s;em|bly of mini&s;ters met for prayer at <HI>Founders-hall,</HI> upon a very &s;pecial occa&s;i|on. The intention of this meeting, was, to a&s;k the favour of Heaven for a ble&s;s|ing upon a &s;eminary for training up young men for the mini&s;try. This is a &s;ort of a monthly &s;olemnity, and is ordinarily con|cluded with a good dinner. I was in|vited
<PB N="103" REF="015918_0100_0F9B3DAF9961D550">
by a friend to attend this meeting, which I did, both as to the praying and the dining part. We had abundance of both.</P>
<P>The prayers were begun before I came, but I was in time to hear three long prayers, and a tedious dull &s;ermon. There are &s;ome mini&s;ters in <HI>London,</HI> pretend to have a great intimacy with the &s;pirit, but from what I heard, it did not appear that they were more acquainted, than their neighbours. The &s;ermons which I heard from &s;ome of them, were indige&s;ted rhap|&s;odies, de&s;titute of &s;entiment, and crowd|ed with ab&s;urdities. They made exceed|ingly free with the Scriptures, in applying them to ca&s;es quite be&s;ide their purpo&s;es. A my&s;tic jargon, which might have &s;uit|ed the days of <HI>John Dun Scotus,</HI> made up the greate&s;t part of their di&s;cour&s;es, and their prayers were compo&s;ed of irreverend addre&s;&s;es to the Deity, concerning things of very little importance. A &s;hameful particularizing of individual per&s;ons, and of things, which appeared to be intended rather as flattery to their hearers, than &s;o|lemn addre&s;&s;es to God Almighty.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="015918_0101_0F9B3DB3DFD517F8">One thing appeared very &s;trange. The mini&s;ter from the pulpit thought it no &s;hame to &s;ound his own prai&s;es, and &s;peak to his own commendation, in a manner that no mode&s;t per&s;on could ei|ther do without &s;hame, or hear without blu&s;hing. A mini&s;ter mu&s;t be far gone in the practice of hypocri&s;y and &s;elf de|ceit, before he can have the face to com|mend him&s;elf before a public audience. It is impo&s;&s;ible that any man can have a good meaning, when he commends him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>After we had been a long time in the meeting hou&s;e, we at la&s;t retired to the tavern; where the devotion was &s;ucceed|ed with a good dinner, and the Sermon wa&s;hed down with a good gla&s;s. We all were entertained at the expence of the &s;o|ciety, where the devotion was performed, and made kindly welcome by a few very decent laymen. The ma&s;ter of the aca|demy &s;at at the head of the table, and our entertainment was opened with a pretty long grace;&mdash;all hands &s;oon made the be&s;t u&s;e of their time, till their appetites
<PB N="105" REF="015918_0102_0F9B3DB4D99725C0">
were fully &s;atisfied; when two or three toa&s;ts went round, and every man drank what he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>A little tartar of a par&s;on, who&s;e con|&s;cience &s;eemed to be &s;candalized with the dre&s;&s;es of &s;ome of the lay-brethren, though his own was very &s;pruce, and his fingers covered with rings, began an oration up|on the &s;infulne&s;s of tye-wigs.
<Q>Such ornaments (he &s;aid) were incon&s;i&s;tent with the profe&s;&s;ion which they made, and in the days of the <HI>puritans</HI> would not have been allowed.&mdash;But now the times were bad, and &s;in abounded to a great pitch.</Q>
A waggi&s;h young doctor who was pre&s;ent, could &s;carcely keep his gravity, when the di&s;pute con|cerning the tails of wigs was begun, which greatly chagrined the little par&s;on. The lay gentlemen &s;aid &s;ome &s;en&s;ible things in defence of their wigs, and &s;eem|ed to have the better of the argument.
