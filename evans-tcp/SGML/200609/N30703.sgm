<HEAD>A Warning to <HI>Young</HI> &amp; <HI>Old:</HI> In the Execution of <HI>William Wieer,</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the 21^&s;^t of <HI>November,</HI> 1754, for the <HI>Murder</HI> of <HI>William Chi&s;m,</HI> on the 6^t^h of <HI>April</HI> la&s;t.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>BEHOLD good People now I pray,</L>
<L>And give you Heed to what I &s;ay;</L>
<L>Your due Attention I do crave,</L>
<L>That you the Benefit may have.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>The Subject of my pre&s;ent Rhime,</L>
<L>Is <HI>Will'm Wieer</HI>'s wicked Crime:</L>
<L>A Crime for which he now mu&s;t die,</L>
<L>By his own Act of Cruelty.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Poor <HI>Chi&s;m</HI> he in Anger &s;lew,</L>
<L>Without a Provocation too;</L>
<L>This poor Man's Life he took away,</L>
<L>Not having Time, one Word to &s;ay.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>And now his Pa&s;&s;ion he witholds,</L>
<L>And to his great Surprize beholds,</L>
<L>The Wound was Mortal which he gave,</L>
<L>But hopes for Mercy yet to have.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>But where &s;hall he for Mercy Cry?</L>
<L>But to the Sov'reign GOD mo&s;t high:</L>
<L>Who has in &s;acred Writ declar'd,</L>
<L>That &s;uch Men's Lives &s;hall not be &s;par'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Ah! Pa&s;&s;ion now, that ran &s;o high,</L>
<L>As to a&s;cend the Clouds and Sky;</L>
<L>Where there is neither End nor Bound:</L>
<L>But <HI>Murder!</HI> 'Tis a dreadful Sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Now <HI>Wieer</HI> for this horrid Crime,</L>
<L>Is doom'd to die before his Time;</L>
<L>He did'nt intend, (as he doth &s;ay,)</L>
<L>To take poor <HI>Chi&s;m</HI>'s Life&punc; away.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>But whether he did or no, 'tis true,</L>
<L>By GOD's ju&s;t Laws, he has but due;</L>
<L>For <HI>Murder</HI> is a dreadful Fact,</L>
<L>Which none I hope will dare Tran&s;act.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Here's an Example for you all,</L>
<L>Both for the Great, as well as Small;</L>
<L>The Old as well as Young may be</L>
<L>Accu&s;tom'd to this fatal Tree.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>That GOD who&s;e Ways are ju&s;t and true,</L>
<L>Doth evr'y wicked Way pur&s;ue;</L>
<L>Therefore be always on your Guard,</L>
<L>In all your Doings plea&s;e the LORD:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI</HEAD>
<L>Correct your Pa&s;&s;ions in due Time,</L>
<L>Le&s;t you commit this horrid Crime;</L>
<L>The Crime of Murder, few's &s;o great,</L>
<L>And you repent when it's too late.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>Keep free from Slander and from Pelf,</L>
<L>And love your Neighbour as your&s;elf,</L>
<L>Be thus to them both kind and true,</L>
<L>As you'd have them be &s;o to you.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>Let GOD's Commands be your Delight,</L>
<L>In all your Dealings be upright:</L>
<L>Be always careful to fulfil</L>
<L>The Sixth Command, (<HI>Thou &s;halt not Kill.</HI>)</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis GOD's free, rich and &s;ov'reign Grace,</L>
<L>That we're not in this poor Man's Place;</L>
<L>Then let us &s;hun all wicked Ways,</L>
<L>Before the <HI>Gallows</HI> end our Days.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>Happy they'll be, and happy thrice,</L>
<L>Who will take Coun&s;el and Advice,</L>
<L>From this poor Man's unhappy Fate,</L>
<L>To view their own mo&s;t &s;ad E&s;tate.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>If GOD's Commands you do obey,</L>
<L>Depend on Him, and often pray,</L>
<L>He will in his abundant Grace,</L>
<L>Pre&s;erve you in your righteous Ways.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>His glorious Grace will then come down</L>
<L>And all your wicked Pa&s;&s;ions drown:</L>
<L>Then take the Wing, to JESUS fly,</L>
<L>And &s;ee thy GOD above the Sky.</L>
