<HEAD>THE BOARDING SCHOOL, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the delightful margin of the Mer|rimac, in one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and beautiful &s;ituations, which that fertile and healthful part of America affords, lived Mrs. Williams, the vir|tuous relict of a re&s;pectable clergyman.</P>
<P>She had two daughters, lovely and promi&s;ing as ever parent could boa&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams's circum&s;tances were ea&s;y. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a little patrimony, to which &s;he retired, after her hu&s;band's decea&s;e; but a de&s;ire of pre|&s;erving this for her children, and a wi&s;h to pro|mote their advantage and enlarge their &s;ociety, induced her to open a Boarding School.</P>
<P>As &s;he had an eye, no le&s;s to the &s;ocial plea&s;ure, than to the pecuniary profit of the undertaking, &s;he admitted only &s;even, at a time, to the privilege of her tuition.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="033748_0004_0FF9214543A98BB8">The&s;e were all young ladies, who had pre|viou&s;ly received the fir&s;t rudiments of learning, and been initiated into the polite accomplish|ments, which embelli&s;h virtue and &s;often the cares of human life. They had generally lived in the metropolis, and had acquired the graces of a fa&s;hionable deportment; but they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed different tempers and di&s;po&s;itions, which had been variou&s;ly, and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, erroneou&s;ly managed.</P>
<P>To cultivate the expanding flowers, and to prune the juvenile eccentricities, which were di&s;&s;eminated among the&s;e tender plants; or, to &s;peak without a figure, to extend and purify their ideas, to elevate and refine their affections, to govern and direct their pa&s;&s;ions, required an eye, watchful, and a hand, &s;kilful as tho&s;e of the judicious Mrs. Williams.</P>
<P>While her judgment and prudence aided the u&s;eful acqui&s;itions of the mind, a &s;prightly fancy and a cheerful di&s;po&s;ition, regulated by experi|ence and di&s;cretion, qualified her to enter, at once, with becoming dignity and conde&s;cending ea&s;e, into all their concerns; to participate their plea&s;ures; while, with candour and mildne&s;s, &s;he reproved their errors, detected their follies, and facilitated their amendment.</P>
<P>As the young ladies had fini&s;hed their &s;chool education, before Mrs. Williams received them to her man&s;ion, her in&s;tructions were more
<PB N="7" REF="033748_0005_0FF9214F58F76350">
e&s;pecially de&s;igned to poli&s;h the mental part, to call forth the dormant virtues, to unite and ar|range the charms of per&s;on and mind, to in&s;pire a due &s;en&s;e of decorum and propriety, and to in&s;til &s;uch principles of piety, morality, benevo|lence, prudence and economy, as might be u&s;e|ful through life.</P>
<P>Their time was, accordingly, di&s;po&s;ed in a manner mo&s;t conducive to the attainment of the&s;e objects. Every part of it was employed to &s;ome valuable purpo&s;e; "for idlene&s;s," Mrs. Williams ob&s;erved, "is the ru&s;t of the mind."</P>
<P>Whatever tended to enlarge, inform, improve, or amu&s;e, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed worthy their attention.</P>
<P>She particularly endeavoured to dome&s;ticate them; to turn their thoughts to the beneficial and nece&s;&s;ary qualifications of private life; often inculcating, that
<Q><L>Nothing lovelier can be found in woman,</L>
<L>Than to &s;tudy hou&s;ehold good;</L></Q>
and labouring to convince them of the utter in|&s;ignificance and u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of that part of the &s;ex, who are
<Q><L>Bred only and completed to the ta&s;te</L>
<L>Of lu&s;tful appetence; to &s;ing, to dance,</L>
<L>To dre&s;s, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye.</L></Q></P>
<P>Early ri&s;ing &s;he recommended, both by precept and example. This, &s;he &s;aid, would not only
<PB N="8" REF="033748_0006_0FF9217A04DB9378">
promote their health, but render them mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of many hours, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t in enervating &s;loth and inaction. "And &s;hould we," continued &s;he, "who have &s;o much cau&s;e for ex|ertion, thus &s;acrifice the be&s;t part of our time?"</P>
<L>"Fal&s;ely luxurious, will not man awake,</L>
<L>And, &s;tarting from the bed of &s;loth, enjoy</L>
<L>The cool, the fragrant, and the &s;ilent hour,</L>
<L>To meditation due, and &s;acred &s;ong?</L>
<L>And is there aught in &s;leep can charm the wi&s;e?</L>
<L>To lie in dead oblivion, lo&s;ing half</L>
<L>The fleeting moments of too &s;hort a life?</L>
<L>Total extinction of th' enlighten'd &s;oul!</L>
<L>Or el&s;e to &s;everi&s;h vanity alive,</L>
<L>Wilder'd and to&s;&s;ing through di&s;temper'd dreams?</L>
<L>Who would in &s;uch a gloomy &s;tate remain,</L>
<L>Longer than nature craves; when every mu&s;e&punc;</L>
<L>And every blooming plea&s;ure wait without,</L>
<L>To ble&s;s the wildly devious morning walk?"</L>
<P>Another laudable practice of Mrs. Williams, was perfect regularity in the government of her pupils, and in the arrangement of their daily exerci&s;es. "When," &s;aid &s;he, "we ob&s;erve the order of the natural world, and admire the con|&s;i&s;tency and harmony of every part, we may hence derive a le&s;&s;on, for the regulation of our conduct, in the &s;phere a&s;&s;igned to us."</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this plan of operation, the young ladies aro&s;e at five; from which they had two hours at their own di&s;po&s;al, till the bell &s;um|moned them at &s;even, to the hall, where, the
<PB N="9" REF="033748_0007_0FF921C4D229E700">
ceremonies of the morning &s;alutation over, they breakfa&s;ted together; their repa&s;t being &s;ea&s;oned with the unre&s;trained effu&s;ions of good humour and &s;ociability. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, Mrs. Wil|liams &s;u&s;pended the authority of the matron, that, by accu&s;toming her pupils to familiarity in her pre&s;ence, they might be free from re&s;traint; and, feeling perfectly ea&s;y and unawed, appear in their genuine characters. By this mean &s;he had an opportunity of ob&s;erving any indecorum of behaviour, or wrong bias; which &s;he kept in mind, till a proper time to mention, and remon|&s;trate again&s;t it; a method, the &s;alutary effects of which were vi&s;ible in the daily improvement of her pupils.</P>
<P>The breakfa&s;t table removed, each took her needle-work, except one, who read &s;ome amu&s;|ing and in&s;tructive book, for the benefit and en|tertainment of the re&s;t. The &s;ubject was &s;e|lected by Mrs. Williams, who conferred the reading upon them in rotation.</P>
<P>At twelve o'clock, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed till one, when dinner again called them together, which was conducted in the &s;ame manner as the morning repa&s;t.</P>
<P>Having re&s;umed their occupations, the read|er of the day produced &s;ome piece of her own compo&s;ition, either in pro&s;e, or ver&s;e, according to her inclination, as a &s;pecimen of her genius and improvement. This being &s;ubmitted to Mrs.
<PB N="10" REF="033748_0008_0FF9221D538B3068">
Williams's in&s;pection, and the candid peru&s;al and critici&s;m of her companions; and the &s;ubject canva&s;&s;ed with great freedom of opinion, they withdrew from the ta&s;ks of the day to &s;eek that relaxation and amu&s;ement, which each prefer|red. No innocent gratification was denied them. The &s;prightly dance, the &s;entimental &s;ong, and indeed every &s;pecies of pa&s;time, con&s;i&s;tent with the decorum of the &s;ex, was encouraged, as tending to health, cheerfulne&s;s, and alacrity.</P>
<P>In the&s;e plea&s;ing pur&s;uits and enjoyments, the pre&s;ent cla&s;s of happy companions had nearly completed the term allotted them by their pa|rents, and were &s;oon to leave the peaceful &s;hades in which they delighted, when, being a&s;&s;embled on the Monday morning of their la&s;t week, their revered Preceptre&s;s thus acco&s;ted them:</P>
<P>"As the period is approaching, my dear pu|pils, when I mu&s;t re&s;ign your &s;ociety, and quit the important charge of in&s;tructor and friend, which I have &s;u&s;tained with &s;o much plea&s;ure, and, I tru&s;t, with &s;ome degree of fidelity, I &s;hall &s;um up the coun&s;els, admonitions, and advice, which I have frequently inculcated, and endeav|our to impre&s;s them on your minds, as my vale|dictory addre&s;s. For this purpo&s;e, during this la&s;t week of your re&s;idence with me, I &s;hall di&s;|pen&s;e with your u&s;ual exerci&s;es, and &s;ub&s;titute a collection of my own &s;entiments, enforced by the pathos of the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="033748_0009_0FF9227E8C0410A8">"Your docility, and cheerful diligence in at|tending to my in&s;tructions; your mode&s;t, affec|tionate, and re&s;pectful behaviour, together with the laudable progre&s;s you have made in every branch, which you have pur&s;ued, have well re|warded my care, and engaged my approbation and love. To me, therefore, a &s;eparation will be painful. To you the period is important. It is a period, which, while it relieves you from the confinement of &s;chola&s;tic rules, introduces you to new &s;cenes of cares, of plea&s;ures, of tri|als, and of temptations, which will call for the exerci&s;e of every virtue, and afford opportunity for improving the endowments, both natural and acquired, which you po&s;&s;e&s;s. Think not, then, that your emancipation from &s;chools, gives you liberty to neglect the advantages which you have received from them. The obligations under which you are laid to your parents for the edu|cation they have given you, require a diligent improvement of every talent committed to your tru&s;t.</P>
<P>"Of needle-work you are complete mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, from the mo&s;t delicate and highly fini&s;hed, to the mo&s;t ordinary, though perhaps not le&s;s u&s;eful, economy of mending and making the coar&s;er garments of family u&s;e. Many, I am aware, &s;uppo&s;e <HI>this la&s;t</HI> a &s;pecies of learning, which is beneath the attention of a lady: but Clara will
<PB N="12" REF="033748_0010_0FF92284363D19F0">
tell you how valuable it has proved to her; and how valuable it <HI>may</HI> prove to you.</P>
<P>"Nur&s;ed in the lap of affluence, and accu&s;tom|ed to unbounded expen&s;e, Clara little thought, at your age, that &s;he &s;hould ever depend on her needle for the livelihood and decent appearance of a ri&s;ing family. A di&s;creet and prudent moth|er early inculcated the le&s;&s;ons of indu&s;try and economy, which &s;he now practices; and taught her that the knowledge could be of no di&s;&s;ervice, though &s;he never had occa&s;ion for it. She mar|ried with the brighte&s;t pro&s;pects. But a &s;eries of unavoidable di&s;a&s;ters, &s;uch as no human wi&s;|dom could fore&s;ee or prevent, reduced her to narrow circum&s;tances; and, to complete her misfortune, &s;he was left a widow with four &s;mall children. Her parents were in the grave; her patrimony was gone! In this exigence, what was her re&s;ource? Not fruitle&s;s lamentations, and unavailing complaints. She immediately &s;ummoned her re&s;olution; and by the u&s;e of her needle has ever &s;ince &s;upported her&s;elf and family with decency, and been highly re&s;pected for her prudent exertions and exemplary indu&s;try. Di|rectly the rever&s;e of this amiable character is that of Belinda. She was educated in the &s;ame way with Clara; the &s;ame &s;chools gave them tu|ition; and &s;imilar pro&s;pects awaited their entrance into life. Calamities attended the progre&s;s of each; but different as their tempers and di&s;po&s;i|tions
<PB N="13" REF="033748_0011_0FF9228FE2730010">
was their conduct under them. The fall|ing fortunes of Clara were awhile &s;u&s;pended by her di&s;cretion and frugality; while the ruin of Belinda was ha&s;tened by her extravagance, di&s;&s;i|pation, and idlene&s;s. View them, now, in their reduced &s;tate! Neatne&s;s, cheerfulne&s;s, and ac|tivity pre&s;ide in the dwelling of Clara; negli|gence, peevi&s;hne&s;s, and &s;loth are legibly &s;tamped on that of Belinda. The ear is pained by her complaints of poverty; the eye is di&s;gu&s;ted by her &s;latternly appearance, and o&s;tentatious di&s;play of the tattered remnants of finery, which be&s;peak the pride and indolence of their owner; who will neither convert them into more comfortable garments, nor, by repairing, render them be|coming.</P>
<P>"I hope, however, that occa&s;ions like the&s;e may never call for your exertions. But there may be ca&s;es, when, to know the u&s;e of your needles will an&s;wer important purpo&s;es, even in an ex|alted &s;tation, and amid&s;t the &s;plendor of afflu|ence and plenty.</P>
<P>"Matilda dignified a princely fortune by the exerci&s;e of every virtue which can adorn a lady. Among the&s;e, charity &s;hone con&s;picuous. Her maid &s;aid to her, one day, Madam, would you have me lay a&s;ide the&s;e ca&s;t-clothes for &s;ome poor per&s;on? Yes, replied Matilda; but &s;it down, and mend them fir&s;t. Don't you &s;ee they need it? Why, Madam, rejoined the girl, is it not enough
<PB N="14" REF="033748_0012_0FF8C5DEDA6E0978">
for you to give them away? I &s;hould think the lea&s;t they can do is to mend them for them|&s;elves! In that ca&s;e, &s;aid Matilda, my bounty would be greatly dimini&s;hed. People, who need charity have not the nece&s;&s;ary materials for put|ting &s;uch articles into repair; and &s;hould I fur|ni&s;h them, perhaps they have never been taught to u&s;e their needles. No more have I, returned the maid. Have you not? &s;aid Matilda. Well then, &s;it down, and I will direct your ingenuity upon the&s;e clothes. By this mean you may learn a very u&s;eful le&s;&s;on, I a&s;&s;ure you; a le&s;&s;on, which by practi&s;ing for your&s;elf, will enable you to lay up part of your wages again&s;t the time when &s;ickne&s;s or old age &s;hall take you from your labours.</P>
<P>"Such examples of conde&s;cen&s;ion and benevo|lence to inferiors, are of more real and la&s;ting u&s;e than pounds prodigally be&s;towed.</P>
<P>"Do you &s;eek higher te&s;timonies of the honor and utility of this employment? You may col|lect many from the hi&s;tories which you have read during the la&s;t year. Among the Romans, and &s;everal other nations of antiquity, a &s;carf, wrought by the needle of a favourite fair, was re|ceived as an honorable token of re&s;pect, and im|proved as an invincible &s;timulus to heroic deeds. Ladies of the fir&s;t rank and &s;tation con&s;idered it as no derogation from the dignity or delicacy of their character, to make their own apparel,
<PB N="15" REF="033748_0013_0FF922972FC33FC8">
and that of their families. The virtuous Pan|thea, when her hu&s;band was going to fight in the cau&s;e of Cyrus, her generous deliverer, magnificently adorned his per&s;on, and decorated his armour with her own needle-work.</P>
<P>"We ought never to be idle. No moment &s;hould be unoccupied. Some employment, &s;al|utary, either to body or mind, or both, &s;hould be con&s;tantly pur&s;ued; and the needle is al|ways at hand to &s;upply the want of other avoca|tions. The li&s;tle&s;s vacuity, which &s;ome young ladies indulge, renders them extremely unhappy, though they are in&s;en&s;ible of the cau&s;e, and &s;eek to beguile the time in frivolous amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>"A &s;till more endearing motive remains to be &s;ugge&s;ted; and that is the plea&s;ure, which your accompli&s;hments in this ornamental and u&s;eful art mu&s;t afford your parents; and the pain, which your neglect of it hereafter mu&s;t occa&s;ion them.</P>
<P>"But your faithful and a&s;&s;iduous improvement of time, &s;ince you have been with me, is a &s;ure pledge of your per&s;everance in the path of duty, and your progre&s;s in every virtue. I tru&s;t, there|fore, that what I have &s;aid will be engraved on your memories; and that &s;ome u&s;eful ideas will be &s;elected by each of you for your future ad|vantage.</P>
<P>"Your minds are a good &s;oil; and may I not flatter my&s;elf, that the &s;eeds of in&s;truction which
<PB N="16" REF="033748_0014_0FF9229F5B1194A8">
I have &s;own, "will &s;pring up, and yield fruit abundantly?"</P>
<P>With one voice, they mo&s;t affectionately a&s;&s;ured Mrs. Williams, that it &s;hould be their daily &s;tudy to profit by her le&s;&s;ons; and withdrew.</P>

<HEAD>Monday, P. M. READING.</HEAD>
<P>BEING a&s;&s;embled, this afternoon, Mrs. Williams thus re&s;umed her di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>"Reading is &s;o common a part of education, that the value of it is not duly e&s;timated; nor the manner of performing it, &s;ufficiently attend|ed to. It is not the mere propriety of pronun|ciation, accent, and cadence, which con&s;titutes good reading. You mu&s;t enter into the &s;pirit of the &s;ubject, and feel intere&s;ted in the matter, be|fore you can profit by the exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>"But you are &s;o well acquainted with the manner of reading, that the quality of books mo&s;t worthy of your peru&s;al is the only point on which I need to enlarge.</P>
<P>"Romances, the ta&s;te of former times, are now &s;o far out of vogue, that it is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to warn you again&s;t them. They exhibit the &s;pirit of chivalry, knight-errantry, and extrava|gant folly, which prevailed in the age they de|pict. But they are not intere&s;ting; nor can they be plea&s;ing to the correct ta&s;te and refined deli|cacy of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="033748_0016_0FF922ACF79F8468">"Novels are the favourite, and the mo&s;t danger|ous kind of reading, now adopted by the gen|erality of young ladies. I &s;ay dangerous, be|cau&s;e the influence, which, with very few ex|ceptions, they mu&s;t have upon the pa&s;&s;ions of youth, bears an unfavourable a&s;pect on their pu|rity and virtue. The &s;tyle in which they are written is commonly captivating; and the lux|uriance of the de&s;criptions with which they abound, extremely agreeable to the &s;prightly fan|cy, and high expectations of the inexperienced and unreflecting. Their romantic pictures of love, beauty, and magnificence, fill the imagina|tion with ideas which lead to impure de&s;ires, a vanity of exterior charms, and a fondne&s;s for &s;how and di&s;&s;ipation, by no means con&s;i&s;tent with that &s;implicity, mode&s;ty, and cha&s;tity, which &s;hould be the con&s;tant inmates of the female brea&s;t. They often pervert the judg|ment, mi&s;lead the affections, and blind the un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>"A melancholy example of this &s;ort is exhib|ited in Juliana. Juliana was the only daughter of a wealthy merchant, who grudged no ex|pen&s;e which could plea&s;e or embelli&s;h his dar|ling child. He, however, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither lei&s;|ure nor abilities "to teach the young idea how to &s;hoot;" but thought it &s;ufficient that he gave her every advantage, which could be derived from the various &s;chools, to which &s;he was con|&s;igned.
<PB N="19" REF="033748_0017_0FF922B3B29733D0">
She had a brilliant fancy, and a fond|ne&s;s for books, which, properly directed, might have proved of great u&s;e to her. But, having no better principles in&s;tilled into her mind, &s;he indulged her&s;elf in the unlimited reading of novels, and every light publication which a cir|culating library could furni&s;h.</P>
<P>"Hence her imagination took wing, and car|ried her far above the &s;cenes of common life. The exce&s;&s;ive refinement of her mind admitted no ordinary amu&s;ements or avocations. Plain truth from her own &s;ex was an in&s;ult; and from the other, nothing le&s;s than adoration would &s;atisfy her unbounded vanity. Her beauty (of which &s;he really had a con&s;iderable &s;hare) and the large fortune which &s;he would probably in|herit, gained her many admirers; &s;ome of whom were men of unque&s;tionable merit. But a &s;ober, rational court&s;hip could not an&s;wer her ideas of love and gallantry. The &s;wain, who would not die for her, &s;he deemed unworthy of notice.</P>
<P>"Her father &s;trongly recommended a gentle|man, as well calculated, in his opinion, to make her happy, and as having his entire approbation; but &s;he rejected him with di&s;dain, though &s;he could produce no one objection again&s;t his per|&s;on, or character.</P>
<P>"Her father acquie&s;ced; expre&s;&s;ing, however, his regret at the mi&s;taken notions &s;he had im|bibed; and warning her mo&s;t pathetically again&s;t

the indulgence of &s;o romantic a di&s;po&s;ition; yet all in vain. He was con&s;idered as an illiterate plodder after wealth, which &s;he had a right to be&s;tow as &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t the lovely youth whom &s;he had &s;o long contemplated, made his appearance. A mil|itary captain entered the town on the recruiting &s;ervice. Young, hand&s;ome, ea&s;y, bold and a&s;|&s;uming; with all the <HI>bon ton</HI> of the coxcomb, and all the in&s;olence of the novice. He &s;aw Ju|liana; he &s;acrificed to her charms, and conquer|ed. She could not re&s;i&s;t the allurements of his gallantry. His affectation of dying love was received with apparent plea&s;ure; while art and duplicity took advantage of her weakne&s;s, to pre|cipitate her into engagements to pity and relieve him. Her friends &s;aw her danger, and warm|ly remon&s;trated again&s;t her imprudent conduct, in receiving the addre&s;&s;es of a man, de&s;titute of property to &s;upport her, and void of every kind of per&s;onal merit. Her father entreated and im|plored the rejection of her lover, till, finding every other method vain, he at length re&s;olute|ly forbade him the hou&s;e, and his daughter's company. This was viewed as per&s;ecution; and, con&s;i&s;tently with her &s;entiments of adven|turous love, a clande&s;tine amour was commen|ced. Her father &s;urpri&s;ed them together; and, enraged at their di&s;graceful intrigue, &s;eized the captain, and endeavoured to turn him out of doors.

He violently re&s;ented this ungentlemanlike treat|ment, as he termed it, and defended him&s;elf with his &s;word. The old gentleman received a &s;light wound, in the &s;cuffle; but accompli&s;hed his purpo&s;e. Juliana was terrified at this ren|counter, and, dreading her father's di&s;plea&s;ure, ran out with her paramour&punc; His lodgings were near, and thither, favoured by the darkne&s;s of the night, he in&s;tantly led her. She involunta|rily followed him, without con&s;idering the im|propriety of her conduct. Here he drew his &s;word, and, throwing him&s;elf at her feet, pro|fe&s;&s;ed his de&s;pair, and declared him&s;elf re&s;olved to put an immediate end to his life. She en|deavoured to rea&s;on him into calmne&s;s; but in vain. He was &s;en&s;ible, that, if he now relin|qui&s;hed her to her father, he &s;hould lo&s;e her forever. His apparent agony overcame her, and &s;he gave him her hand.</P>
<P>"Her father was almo&s;t di&s;tracted at her elope|ment. He traced her &s;teps, and, following her to the hou&s;e, conde&s;cended to &s;oothe her with parental kindne&s;s; and promi&s;ed her pardon and continued affection, if &s;he would renounce her worthle&s;s lover, and return. She confe&s;&s;ed it was too late; that &s;he was his wife.</P>
<P>"Petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment, he looked at her, for &s;ome time, with &s;peechle&s;s grief; and, &s;how|ing his arm, bound up with the wound he had
<PB N="22" REF="033748_0020_0FF923B3CE76A6E8">
received, left her with every token of angui&s;h and indignation!</P>
<P>"When the fever of pa&s;&s;ion had abated, a re|turning &s;en&s;e of duty in Juliana, and, in the cap|tain, the fear of lo&s;ing the property which he &s;ought, induced them to &s;eek a reconciliation, and make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive efforts to obtain it. But her father was too highly incen&s;ed to grant it to him, on any terms; or to her, on any other than the utter rejection of her unworthy com|panion. The&s;e terms were not complied with.</P>
<P>"Sorrow and vexation preyed &s;o deeply upon the mind of this afflicted parent, that they brought on a rapid decline; and he died without again &s;eeing his undutiful and ruined daughter. His e&s;tate was divided between Juliana and her four brothers. Her portion was received by her hu&s;band, and &s;oon &s;pent in di&s;&s;ipation and ex|ce&s;s. Having rioted on the fortune of his wife, while &s;he often pined at home for want of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, he left her, to join his regiment, promi&s;ing remittances from time to time, for her &s;upport. This promi&s;e, however, was but ill performed; and &s;he now feels the dread|ful effects of her folly, in the accumulated ills of poverty and neglect. Yet &s;he &s;till cheri&s;hes the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s for what has proved her bane. A friend called to &s;ee her, not long &s;ince, and found her the emblem of wretched|ne&s;s and &s;loth. Her emaciated form, her &s;qualid
<PB N="23" REF="033748_0021_0FF923BD72CE2638">
appearance, the di&s;order of her hou&s;e, and her tattered raiment, be&s;poke the &s;hameful negli|gence of the owner. Yet &s;he was &s;itting with a novel in her hand, over which &s;he had apparent|ly been weeping. She expatiated largely on the tale it contained, while her children, who ex|hibited a picture of real woe, engaged not her attention. Her friend enquired how &s;he could be thus intere&s;ted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by mere fiction, while every thing about her was calculated to arou&s;e the keene&s;t feelings of her &s;oul! She coolly replied, I have fortitude &s;ufficient to &s;up|port my own calamity, but I mu&s;t &s;ympathize with the heroine of adver&s;ity. I have not lo&s;t my &s;en&s;ibility with my fortune. My only luxury is now imagination! How ill-timed, and how improperly exerted, was this kind of &s;en&s;ibility, in Juliana! Where, and what was her &s;en&s;i|bility, when &s;he di&s;obeyed an indulgent parent, &s;acrificed her reputation, and threw her&s;elf into the arms of a worthle&s;s man for protection&mdash; from what? from the kindne&s;s and love of her be&s;t friends!</P>
<P>"But I would not be under&s;tood to condemn all novels indi&s;criminately; though great pru|dence is nece&s;&s;ary to make a u&s;eful &s;election. Some of them are fraught with &s;entiment; con|vey le&s;&s;ons for moral improvement; and exhibit &s;triking pictures of virtue rewarded; and of vice, folly, and indi&s;cretion puni&s;hed; which may
<PB N="24" REF="033748_0022_0FF923BFB31A8118">
prove encouragements to imitate, or warnings to avoid &s;imilar practices. I &s;hall not de&s;cend to particulars. Tho&s;e, which are &s;anctioned by the general voice of delicacy and refinement, may be allowed a reading; yet none &s;hould engro&s;s your minds, to the neglect of more important objects; nor be &s;uffered to monopolize too large a portion of your time.</P>
<P>"Novels are a kind of light reading, on which the imagination fea&s;ts, while the more &s;ub&s;tan|tial food which is requi&s;ite to the nouri&s;hment of the under&s;tanding, is either unta&s;ted or undi|ge&s;ted. Imagination is a &s;portive faculty, which &s;hould be curbed by the reins of prudence and judgment. Its &s;allies are delightful in youth, provided they be not too excur&s;ive.</P>
<P>"Poetry is, by &s;ome, ranked with novels; but I think injudiciou&s;ly. Good poetry is certainly a &s;ublime &s;ource of entertainment and in&s;truc|tion. What mu&s;ic is to the ear, poetry is to the heart. There mu&s;t, indeed, be a natural ta&s;te for it, before it can be highly reli&s;hed or enjoy|ed; and this ta&s;te, wherever it exi&s;ts, &s;hould be cultivated. I know of no kind of reading more richly formed for the mental repa&s;t of a liberal and poli&s;hed young lady, than the poetical pro|ductions of true genius. The trifling and in|delicate cantos of ordinary witlings, and every|day poeta&s;ters, are unworthy your attention. But the &s;pecies of poetry which I now recom|mend,
<PB N="25" REF="033748_0023_0FF923C56143F208">
is peculiarly adapted to &s;often the pa&s;&s;ions, excite &s;ympathy, and meliorate the affections. It &s;oothes the jarring cares of life, and, pervading the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the &s;oul, &s;erves to rou&s;e and animate its dormant powers.</P>
<P>"Many e&s;&s;ays, written by monitors of both &s;exes, are extant, which you may find profitable and plea&s;ing, both in youth and more advan|ced age. Among the foremo&s;t of the&s;e, I men|tion Mrs. Chapone's letters to her niece, which contain a valuable trea&s;ure of information and advice.</P>
<P>"But among your hours devoted to reading, hi&s;tory mu&s;t not be without a place. Here an exten&s;ive field of ages and generations, which have gone before you, is opened to your view. Here your curio&s;ity may be gratified by a retro|&s;pection of events, which, by conducting your thoughts to remote&s;t elimes and periods, inter|e&s;ts and enlarges the mind. Here the various revolutions, the ri&s;e, fall, and di&s;memberment of ancient kingdoms and &s;tates may be traced to the different &s;prings of action, in which they originated. Hence you may gain a competent acquaintance with human nature in all its mod|ifications, from the mo&s;t rude and barbarous, to the mo&s;t civilized and poli&s;hed &s;tages of &s;ocie|ty. This is a &s;pecies of knowledge, which will not only be of con&s;tant u&s;e to you, in the gov|ernment of your own temper and manners, but
<PB N="26" REF="033748_0024_0FF923C6F567EBB8">
highly ornamental in your intercour&s;e with the polite and learned world.</P>
<P>"But let your reading of every de&s;cription be regular and methodical. Never confu&s;e your minds by a variety of &s;ubjects at once. When you turn your attention to any one in particular, fini&s;h, and lay that a&s;ide, before you take up another. Let what you read be well under|&s;tood at the time, and well dige&s;ted afterwards. Po&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elves, at lea&s;t, of the leading traits: otherwi&s;e your labour will be totally lo&s;t. If con|venient, always recapitulate what you have been peru&s;ing, and annex to it your own &s;entiments and remarks, to &s;ome friend. If you have no friend at hand, who will be di&s;po&s;ed to hear, recollect, and run it over in your own thoughts. This will be a great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to memory. But whatever be the kind of reading which you un|dertake, &s;elect &s;uch authors as good judges e&s;|teem the be&s;t, upon the &s;ubject. Have a partic|ular regard to the morality and delicacy of the books you peru&s;e.</P>
<P>"When you read for mere amu&s;ement, (which &s;hould &s;eldom happen) be careful not to corrupt and vitiate your ta&s;te by frothy and illiberal per|formances, which will degrade the dignity and fully the purity of your minds. That time is very greatly mi&s;pent, which is be&s;towed in read|ing what can yield no in&s;truction. Not a mo|ment's attention &s;hould be given to books which
<PB N="27" REF="033748_0025_0FF924EB83120E78">
afford not &s;ome degree of improvement. Al|ways have an eye, therefore, to profit, as well as to plea&s;ure. Remember that youth is the &s;eed-time of life. You are now to cultivate that knowledge, which future years mu&s;t ripen. Free from tho&s;e dome&s;tic cares, which will engro&s;s and occupy your minds, when placed at the head of families, a mo&s;t ine&s;timable price is now put into your hands to get wi&s;dom. Now you may learn; then you mu&s;t practice.</P>
<P>"Now, therefore, lay up in &s;tore &s;ome pro|vi&s;ion for every exigence, &s;ome embelli&s;hment for every &s;tation.</P>
<P>"Look upon Elvira. Her acquirements in a &s;ingle &s;tate have qualified her for a &s;hining pat|tern of matronal duties. Her hu&s;band's bu&s;ine&s;s abroad prevents him from attending to dome&s;tic avocations; nor need he be anxious re&s;pecting the management of his hou&s;ehold affairs. El|vira is pre&s;ent to every occa&s;ion. The &s;uperin|tendence of her family, and the education of her children is her delight. Capable of in&s;tructing them in every needful branch of &s;cience, and of furni&s;hing them with every requi&s;ite endow|ment, &s;he is, at once, their guide, their exam|ple, and their friend. When her hu&s;band re|turns from the cares and fatigues of bu&s;ine&s;s, with what becoming ea&s;e and cheerfulne&s;s does &s;he di&s;&s;ipate the anxiety which &s;ometimes hangs upon his brow, and exhilerate his &s;pirits by the
<PB N="28" REF="033748_0026_0FF924EEA6C83900">
enlivening charms of rational and refined con|ver&s;ation! In the entertainment of their friends, how di&s;tingui&s;hed a part &s;he &s;u&s;tains! Her pow|ers of mind have been &s;o happily improved, that &s;he is able to di&s;cu&s;s every &s;ubject with ea&s;e and propriety. To an enlarged under&s;tanding and a cultivated ta&s;te, to an exten&s;ive knowledge of the world and an acquaintance with polite literature, &s;he &s;uperadds tho&s;e amiable virtues, which give &s;ociety its highe&s;t reli&s;h; while the elegance of her manners and the mode&s;ty of her deportment are a proof of the greatne&s;s of her mind, and render her e&s;teemed, beloved, and re&s;pected by all who know her.</P>
<P>"But I flatter my&s;elf that each of you, my dear pupils, will be an Elvira. Then will you do ju&s;tice to the &s;uperior advantages of your edu|cation; be the delight of your friends, and the ornaments of your country.</P>
<P>"Religious &s;ubjects mu&s;t, by no means, be neg|lected in the cour&s;e of your reading. Let the BIBLE be the rule of your faith and practice. If you wi&s;h an explanation of any particular pa&s;|&s;ages, &s;eek it from &s;ome judicious and pious friend, or in the writings of &s;ome judicious and learned commentator. But always attend chief|ly to tho&s;e points which &s;erve to mend the heart, rather than to tho&s;e knotty, metaphy&s;ical di&s;qui|&s;itions, which tend only to perplex the under|&s;tanding, and involve the inquirer in &s;uch laby|rinths

of ab&s;tru&s;ity, as are above human com|prehen&s;ion, and beyond human concern. The e&s;&s;ential doctrines and precepts of the go&s;pel are level to every capacity; and upon a life and con|ver&s;ation governed by the&s;e, our hopes, both of pre&s;ent peace and future glory, mu&s;t be founded. "He hath &s;hewed thee what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"</P>

<HEAD>Tuesday, A. M. WRITING AND ARITHMETIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE young ladies being &s;eated, this morn|ing, their Preceptre&s;s addre&s;&s;ed them as follows.</P>
<P>"Writing is productive both of plea&s;ure and improvement. It is a &s;ource of entertainment which enlarges the mental powers more, perhaps, than any other. The mind is obliged to exer|tion for materials to &s;upply the pen. Hence it collects new &s;tores of knowledge, and is enriched by its own labours. It imperceptibly trea&s;ures up the ideas, which the hand impre&s;&s;es. An opportunity is furni&s;hed of reviewing our &s;enti|ments before they are expo&s;ed; and we have the privilege of correcting or expunging &s;uch as are erroneous. For this purpo&s;e, you will find it a good method to collect and write your thoughts upon any &s;ubject that occurs; for by repeatedly arranging and revi&s;ing your expre&s;&s;ions and opinions, you may daily improve them, and learn to think and rea&s;on properly on every occa&s;ion. By this mean you may likewi&s;e provide your|&s;elves with a fund of matter for future u&s;e, which, without this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the memory
<PB N="31" REF="033748_0029_0FF924FB8E10A5A0">
would not retain. It will be of great &s;ervice to note down in your common-place book &s;uch particulars as you may judge worth remember|ing, with your own ob&s;ervations upon them. This will be a kind of amu&s;ement which will exerci&s;e your thinking powers at the time, and, by recurring to it afterwards, it may afford you many u&s;eful hints.</P>
<P>"The frequent u&s;e of the pen is calculated to refine and enlarge your under&s;tandings. Have you any talent at compo&s;ition? it will be increa&s;ed by cultivation.</P>
<P>"Neglect no opportunity, therefore, which your lei&s;ure affords, of delighting your friends, and accompli&s;hing your&s;elves by the exerci&s;e of your genius in this way.</P>
<P>"Thrice ble&s;&s;ed are we, the happy daughters of this land of liberty, where the female mind is un&s;hackled by the re&s;traints of tyrannical cu&s;tom, which in many other regions confines the ex|ertions of genius to the u&s;urped powers of lordly man! Here virtue, merit, and abilities are properly e&s;timated under whatever form they ap|pear. Here the widely extended fields of litera|ture court attention; and the American fair are invited to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the flowers, and cultivate the ex|panding laurel.</P>
<P>"But the &s;pecies of writing, which is open to every capacity, and ornamental to every &s;tation, is the epi&s;tolary. This, between particular friends,
<PB N="32" REF="033748_0030_0FF92501ADB78D60">
is highly agreeable and intere&s;ting. It is a meth|od of interchanging &s;entiments, and of enjoying intercour&s;e with tho&s;e from whom you are far removed, which is a happy &s;ub&s;titute for per&s;on|al conver&s;ation. In a corre&s;pondence of this &s;ort, all affectation, formality, and bomba&s;t &s;hould be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>"Ea&s;e, frankne&s;s, &s;implicity, and &s;incerity &s;hould be its leading traits. Yet let not your letters be compo&s;ed of mere &s;ounding terms, and verbo&s;e egoti&s;m; but intermix &s;entiment with expre&s;&s;ion, in &s;uch a manner as may be improving as well as plea&s;ing. Letters of friend&s;hip &s;hould con|duce no le&s;s to the advantage than entertainment of the per&s;on addre&s;&s;ed; and mere cur&s;ory let|ters, of general acquaintance, mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be written with propriety and accuracy. The form|ation of the characters, the &s;pelling, the punctu|ation, as well as the &s;tyle and &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t be at|tended to.</P>
<P>"Never omit noticing the receipt of letters, un|le&s;s you mean to affront the writers. Not to an|&s;wer a letter, without being able to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome &s;pecial rea&s;on for the neglect, is equally unpar|donable as to keep &s;ilence when conver&s;ation is addre&s;&s;ed to you in per&s;on.</P>
<P>"By habituating your&s;elves to writing, what may, at fir&s;t, appear a ta&s;k, will become extreme|ly plea&s;ant. Refu&s;e not, then, to improve this part of your education, especially by your fre|quent

and dutifully affectionate epi&s;tles to your parents, when ab&s;ent from them. Expre&s;s your gratitude for their care, and convince them it has not been lo&s;t upon you.</P>
<P>"Always employ your pens upon &s;omething u&s;eful and refined. Let no light or loo&s;e com|po&s;itions occupy your time and thoughts; but remember that what you utter in this way is in &s;ome mea&s;ure the picture of your hearts. Vir|tue forbid, that this favourite employment &s;hould be di&s;graced by impurity, indelicacy, or the com|munication of vicious and ignoble &s;entiments!</P>
<P>"One of the &s;ages of antiquity being a&s;ked why he was &s;o long in writing his opinion, replied, "I am writing for futurity."</P>
<P>"Your characters during life, and even when you &s;hall &s;leep in the du&s;t, may re&s;t on the efforts of your pens. Beware then how you employ them. Let not the merit of your attainments in this noble art be degraded by improper &s;ubjects for its exerci&s;e. Suffer not the expectation of &s;ecrecy to induce you to indulge your pens upon &s;ubjects, which you would blu&s;h to have expo&s;|ed. In this way your characters may be injured, and your happine&s;s de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>"Celia and Cecilia were companions at a board|ing &s;chool. When &s;eparated, they commenced an epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence, on which each val|ued her&s;elf. Their former intimacy, which they termed friend&s;hip, prompted them to write with
<PB N="34" REF="033748_0032_0FF926332E8CF248">
unlimited confidence; and, without the lea&s;t re|&s;erve, to reveal every dictate of levity and thought|le&s;s folly. They imagined them&s;elves perfectly &s;ecure from the cen&s;ure of the critic. Their education had not taught them, that a virtuous mind &s;hould &s;hrink even from ideal indelicacy. Celia was courted by Silvander, a young man of whom &s;he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond; but &s;he had art and re&s;olution enough to conceal her letters from his in&s;pection, though he often &s;olicited a communication of her corre&s;pondence. At length he became impatient for a peru&s;al of letters which appeared &s;o plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting to the parties, and &s;u&s;picious that &s;ome particular cau&s;e directed their privacy. Influenced by the&s;e mo|tives, Silvander bribed a market-boy, who came from the village where Cecilia lived, and always conveyed the letters to and from her, to give them fir&s;t into his hand. How a&s;toni&s;hed was he to find the lightne&s;s of mind exemplified in them! Purity of &s;entiment, delicacy of thought, and refinement of ta&s;te were entirely laid a&s;ide; and illiberal wit, frothy je&s;ts, double entendres, and ridiculous love-tales were &s;ub&s;tituted in their place. His name was u&s;ed with &s;o much free|dom, and every circum&s;tance relative to his in|tercour&s;e, and propo&s;ed connexion with Celia, was bandied with &s;uch familiarity, that he was mortified, di&s;gu&s;ted, and chagrined, in the ex|treme. He had the policy, however, to conceal
<PB N="35" REF="033748_0033_0FF92635D9608560">
the di&s;covery till he had copied a con&s;iderable number of Celia's letters, leaving out whatever had reference to his own affairs. He then re|venged him&s;elf by di&s;clo&s;ing his knowledge to her, avowing his indignation at her weakne&s;s, duplicity and folly, and taking an immediate and final leave. Not content with this, he even cir|culated her letters among his acquaintance. This fixed the &s;tamp of ignominy on the corre&s;pond|ents; and their names and characters were ren|dered as ridiculous as &s;candal and malicious wit could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>"Celia was almo&s;t di&s;tracted at the lo&s;s of her lover; but when &s;he found the method he had taken to puni&s;h her indi&s;cretion, and that her reputation was thus materially injured, &s;he &s;eclud|ed her&s;elf, in a great mea&s;ure, from &s;ociety. Her &s;en&s;ibility received a wound which could never be healed; and &s;he lived and died in melancholy, regret, and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>"However cen&s;urable the unju&s;t and ungener|ous conduct of Silvander may be deemed, yet no adequate excu&s;e can be offered for the young ladies, who di&s;honored their pens and their tal|ents by a mo&s;t improper and unbecoming u&s;e of both.</P>
<P>"Next to writing, arithmetic u&s;ually claims at|tention. This is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in every department, and in every &s;tage of life. Even in youth, the proper arrangement of your expen&s;es
<PB N="36" REF="033748_0034_0FF92638599F4BB0">
will conduce greatly to your advantage; and when placed at the head of families, it will be very friendly to the order and economy of your dome&s;tic affairs. But, leaving your matronal conduct to future admonition, many benefits re|&s;ult from keeping regular accounts in a &s;ingle &s;tate. Your parents allow you a certain &s;um for your own private u&s;e. Fa&s;hion and folly are al|ways bu&s;y in creating innumerable imaginary wants, which mu&s;t exceed your finances, if you do not attend to an exact adju&s;tment of your ex|penditures. For this purpo&s;e, always calculate your immediate and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary demands. Let the&s;e be fir&s;t &s;upplied, and then, if your funds be not exhau&s;ted, more &s;uperfluous ones may occupy your thoughts. There is one claim, however, which mu&s;t not be neglected, and that is CHARITY. You will, therefore, manage your expen&s;es in &s;uch a manner as to re&s;erve &s;ome portion of your income for the nece&s;&s;itous. Should you think your allowance in&s;ufficient to admit the children of want to a &s;hare, let your benevolence plead for the retrenchment of &s;ome trifling article which you may di&s;pen&s;e with, without much inconvenience; and the exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from the be&s;towment, will more than counterbalance the &s;acrifice.

<P>"The father of Lucinda was in ea&s;y circum|&s;tances, while he could perform the duties and enjoy the profits of a lucrative bu&s;ine&s;s. He was the affectionate parent of a numerous family, to who&s;e education and improvement he attended with unwearied diligence and plea&s;ure; till re|peated lo&s;&s;es in trade, and di&s;appointments in his worldly expectations embarra&s;&s;ed his affairs, de|pre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirits, and impaired his health. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e difficulties, his amiable and beloved wife was removed by death. This trial was greater than he could &s;upport. He &s;unk un|der the affliction, and lo&s;t his rea&s;on. Lucinda was the elde&s;t of &s;ix children, the care of whom, with the melancholy ta&s;k of attending and mini&s;|tering to the nece&s;&s;ities of her unhappy father, de|volved on her. She looked upon the woe-fraught &s;cene, and wept. Her heart was &s;inking under the weight of grief; and hope, the be&s;t &s;oother of the unfortunate, had nearly abandoned her. She advi&s;ed with her friends, who propo&s;ed to relieve the family by means of a &s;ub&s;cription. Lucinda thanked them for their proffered kind|ne&s;s, and returned to her di&s;con&s;olate habitation. She deliberated on the projected mea&s;ure; which &s;he con&s;idered mu&s;t be &s;low, uncertain, and, at any rate, inadequate to their future exigences.

She could not reconcile her&s;elf to the idea of her father's depending on charity for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Yet what could be done? One re&s;ource only remained;&mdash;her own exertions. By the&s;e &s;he flattered her&s;elf, that &s;he might &s;ave the family from &s;uffering want, and di&s;charge the obliga|tions &s;he owed to her revered parent. Her edu|cation, by which, among other branches of learn|ing, &s;he had been well in&s;tructed in arithmetic, (that being her father's favourite &s;tudy) qualified her for this undertaking. She therefore devoted her&s;elf to the bu&s;ine&s;s without delay; examined her father's accounts, collected whatever remain|ed that was valuable; &s;old the &s;uperfluous move|ables, and purcha&s;ed a &s;mall &s;tock for trade. All who knew her motives and merit frequented her &s;hop, and encouraged her by their cu&s;tom and kindne&s;s. By this mean, together with her judi|cious management, and engaging behaviour, &s;he increa&s;ed her bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;uch a degree, as to &s;up|port the family with ea&s;e and reputation.</P>
<P>"Her di&s;creet and dutiful conduct to her fa|ther, &s;oon re&s;tored him to his rea&s;on.</P>
<P>"When he found how prudently and affec|tionately Lucinda had exerted her&s;elf in his be|half, he exclaimed, "Many daughters have done virtuou&s;ly, but thou excelle&s;t them all!"</P>
<P>"He re&s;umed his former bu&s;ine&s;s, and lived to &s;ee his children all well provided for, and happily &s;ettled around him."</P>

<HEAD>Tuesday, P. M. MUSIC and DANCING.</HEAD>
<P>HER pupils having taken their places, Mrs. Williams proceeded.</P>
<P>"In mu&s;ic and dancing you have made &s;uch proficiency that your performances mu&s;t be very plea&s;ing to your friends, before whom you occa|&s;ionally exhibit.</P>
<P>"As dancing is an accompli&s;hment merely ex|ternal, let not the vanity of excellence in it betray it&s;elf in an air of con&s;cious &s;uperiority, when you &s;hine at the ball, and perceive your&s;elves to have attracted the attention and applau&s;e of the gay a&s;&s;embly. But in the mid&s;t of hilarity and mirth, remember that mode&s;ty, diffidence, di&s;cre|tion, and humility are indi&s;pen&s;able appendages of virtue and decency.</P>
<P>"Mu&s;ic is a talent which nature has be&s;towed, and which your application has con&s;iderably im|proved. It has a powerful influence over the heart; wonderfully &s;oothes and humanizes the pa&s;&s;ions, and is a &s;ource of refined plea&s;ure to a mind capable of ta&s;ting its charms.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="033748_0038_0FF92770686B9C48">"Never refu&s;e gratifying your friends by the exertion of your abilities in performing, unle&s;s for &s;ome very &s;pecial rea&s;on. Though I would not have you vain of your &s;kill, and officiou&s;ly forward to di&s;play it; yet the affectation of un|common mode&s;ty, and ignorance, is truly ridicu|lous. To plead inability to exerci&s;e powers, which you are con&s;cious of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, and for which you wi&s;h to be e&s;teemed and honored by others, is fal&s;e delicacy, and will never gain ad|mi&s;&s;ion to the brea&s;t where that which is genuine re&s;ides. How perfectly ab&s;urd it is for a young lady, who is politely reque&s;ted to entertain a company with her mu&s;ical talents, to declare them &s;o &s;mall that &s;he is really a&s;hamed to expo&s;e her&s;elf before &s;uch good judges; or that &s;he has neglect|ed playing, or &s;inging, for &s;ome time, and cannot immediately revive her dormant &s;kill; or that &s;he has forgotten her tunes, or &s;ongs; or that &s;he has a bad cold, (which none but her&s;elf per|ceives) and is unable to &s;ing; or that &s;he is loath to begin this amu&s;ement, and mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon &s;ome other lady's &s;etting the example; which other lady has, in her turn, an equal number of excu&s;es! Thus the time of the company is en|gro&s;&s;ed, and their plea&s;ure &s;u&s;pended, till a long train of arguments, entreaties, and compliments are run through, and her vanity fully gratified by the mo&s;t flattering and importunate &s;olicitations.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="033748_0039_0FF92773D18B45A0">"Then, elate with pride and &s;elf importance, &s;he conde&s;cends to grant their reque&s;t; not con|&s;idering how far &s;he has derogated from her own merit by the futile artifice &s;he has employed; an artifice unworthy of an ingenuous mind, and di&s;|graceful to any lady who has arrived to years of di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>"Let us view this eva&s;ive manner of &s;eeking compliments a little nearer. When a per&s;on is known to be mi&s;tre&s;s of this delightful art, what can be her motive for delaying the gratification of her friends by its exerci&s;e, and refu&s;ing a compliance with their wi&s;hes, till their patience is exhau&s;ted? I believe that excu&s;es, in this ca&s;e, are very &s;eldom &s;incere. The youthful mind is not in&s;en&s;ible to prai&s;e, nor indifferent to the means of obtaining it.</P>
<P>"Why then &s;hould it not be received and in|crea&s;ed by a ready and obliging compliance? A de&s;ire to plea&s;e is u&s;ually attended with &s;ucce&s;s; and for what rea&s;on &s;hould the power and di&s;po|&s;ition be artfully concealed?</P>
<P>"Always pre&s;erve a frankne&s;s and &s;incerity in your actions and de&s;igns. The&s;e will add digni|ty to your conde&s;cen&s;ions, and gracefulne&s;s to your deportment.</P>
<P>"Ri&s;e &s;uperior to tho&s;e little arts which be&s;peak the fine&s;&s;e of a childi&s;h folly, or a narrow mind. Do honor to this, as well as to every other part of your education, by acting conformably to the
<PB N="42" REF="033748_0040_0FF92779A919ED48">
precepts which have been given you, the knowl|edge which you have acquired, and the opportu|nities with which you may be furni&s;hed for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"Mu&s;ic and dancing, though polite and elegant accompli&s;hments, are, perhaps, the mo&s;t fa&s;ci|nating, and, of cour&s;e, the mo&s;t dangerous of any that fall under that de&s;cription. When in|dulged to exce&s;s, be&s;ide engro&s;&s;ing much time which ought to be employed in the execution of more nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful de&s;igns, they &s;ome|times allure their fond votaries from that purity and rectitude which are the chief embelli&s;hments of the female character. They lay the mind open to many temptations, and, by nouri&s;hing a friv|olous vanity, benumb the nobler powers both of reflection and action.</P>
<P>"Levitia was endowed, by the joint influence of nature and art, with the&s;e plea&s;ing charms. Sym|metry was perfected in her form; and her voice was melody it&s;elf. Her parents were not in af|fluent circum&s;tances; yet their ta&s;te led them to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e graces and talents in their daughter, which they injudiciou&s;ly flattered them|&s;elves might, one day, rai&s;e her to affluence and fame. Hence they &s;pared no pains nor expen&s;e, in their power to be&s;tow, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her inclina|tion and gratify her wi&s;hes. As &s;he advanced in years, &s;he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated and diligently im|improved tho&s;e endowments which &s;he had been
<PB N="43" REF="033748_0041_0FF9277B4029B7B0">
erroneou&s;ly encouraged, and even taught, to con|&s;ider mo&s;t valuable. To adorn her per&s;on, regu|late her movements, and practi&s;e her mu&s;ic, was all her care. Nor had &s;he a wi&s;h beyond the plea&s;|ures, which &s;he fancied they could yield. Her mind re&s;embled a garden, in which the u&s;eful plants are overrun and choaked by noxious weeds. Here and there a gaudy flower rears its brilliant head, and proudly dares to arre&s;t the eye; while the delicate and u&s;eful lie buried and concealed in the &s;urrounding wa&s;te!</P>
<P>"Flattery was plea&s;ing to her ear, in whatever form it was pre&s;ented. The gay and licentious &s;ought her &s;ociety; and vanity with its attendant train of follies led her imagination far from the &s;phere of life which Providence had a&s;&s;igned her. Her parents &s;aw their own mi&s;take, and were alarmed at her's: but, alas! too late were their endeavours to prevent the mi&s;chiefs which im|pended. They could not &s;upply her unbounded wants; and therefore to gratify her ruling pa&s;|&s;ion, &s;he deemed means of her own invention indi&s;pen&s;able. Among her admirers was a for|eigner, who, failing of &s;ucce&s;s in his own coun|try, &s;ought a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in ours, from the &s;tage. He knew Levitia's talents. The&s;e might give her the palm of applau&s;e, and in his way of life, reader her con&s;picuous. This plan he communicated to her, in&s;idiou&s;ly offering to be|come her guardian, and to put her under the
<PB N="44" REF="033748_0042_0FF9277DAE39A610">
protection of &s;uch friends as &s;hould defend her honor, and en&s;ure her &s;ucce&s;s. She was plea&s;ed with the project. Wholly unacquainted with the world, and un&s;u&s;picious of the &s;ubtle arts of the deluding libertine, &s;he &s;crupled not his ve|racity, but li&s;tened to his in&s;inuating declarations of love and friend&s;hip. She was deceived by the vanity of appearing where her fancied merit would meet with the encouragement and reward it de&s;erved; and vainly imagining that her beau|ty might &s;ecure her elevation and affluence, &s;he readily con&s;ented to the fatal experiment, eloped from her father's hou&s;e, and became a profe&s;&s;ed actre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Her parents were overwhelmed with grief and anxiety, at the di&s;covery; but to no purpo&s;e were all their exertions to reclaim her. She had left them, no more to return; left them, too, with the heart-rending reflection, that they them|&s;elves had heedle&s;sly contributed to her di&s;grace and ruin. But bitter indeed were the fruits of her di&s;obedience and folly!</P>
<P>"She made her appearance on the &s;tage. She &s;ung and danced, for which &s;he was care&s;&s;ed, flattered, and paid. A licentious mode of life quadrating with the levity of her heart, &s;oon left her a prey to &s;eduction. Her gaiety and beauty gained her many votaries, and &s;he became a complete courtezan.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="033748_0043_0FF9278437A9F830">"In the mid&s;t of this career, her mother died of a broken heart, evidently occa&s;ioned by her undutiful and vicious conduct. A &s;en&s;e of her ingratitude to her parents, and her &s;hamele&s;s manner of life &s;truck her mind, not naturally unfeeling, with &s;uch force, as to throw her into a fever which undermined her con&s;titution, de|prived her of her beauty, ruined her voice, and left her without means of &s;upport. Her pre|tended lover, finding &s;he could no longer be u&s;e|ful to him, perfidiou&s;ly abandoned her to pover|ty and &s;hame. She returned, like the prodigal, to her unhappy father, who received, but could not a&s;&s;i&s;t her. Her behaviour, with its con&s;equen|ces in the death of her mother, had impaired his health, depre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirits, and rendered him incapable of providing for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"She is now de&s;pi&s;ed and avoided by all her former acquaintance, and mu&s;t inevitably &s;pend the remainder of her days in wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Let us turn from this di&s;gu&s;ting picture, and behold its contra&s;t in the amiable Florella. To beauty of per&s;on &s;he &s;uperadds delicacy, &s;en&s;i|bility, and every noble quality of the mind. Re&s;pectful to her &s;uperiors, affable, cheerful, and polite to her equals, and conde&s;cendingly kind to her inferiors, Florella is univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, beloved, and admired. Of the plea&s;ing accom|pli&s;hments of mu&s;ic and dancing &s;he is a con&s;um|mate mi&s;tre&s;s. Yet &s;he is &s;uperior to the vain
<PB N="46" REF="033748_0044_0FF92789EC98E2A8">
arts of flattery, while the dignity of con&s;cious virtue rai&s;es her far above the affectation of fal&s;e mode&s;ty and diffidence. To plea&s;e and oblige tho&s;e friends who are intere&s;ted in her happine&s;s, and gratified by her performances, is her delight. Nor does &s;he think it nece&s;&s;ary, by feigned ex|cu&s;es, to delay the plea&s;ure, which &s;he is able to afford; but willingly enhances that plea&s;ure by a ready and cheerful compliance. This &s;he thinks the be&s;t return &s;he can make for their kind at|tention. Though delighted with the&s;e amu&s;e|ments her&s;elf, &s;he, neverthele&s;s, con&s;iders them as amu&s;ements <HI>only</HI>; and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivates the more &s;olid branches of her education. The&s;e, &s;he is wont to &s;ay, may render me u&s;eful and happy, when the voice of mu&s;ic &s;hall be brought low, and when the &s;prightly limbs &s;hall become languid and inactive.</P>
<P>"How happy her parents in her filial duty and affection! How rich the reward of their care and expen&s;e in contributing to her improvements! How happy Florella in their complacency and love, and in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erving them!</P>
<P>"She was, not long &s;ince, addre&s;&s;ed by a gen|tleman, who was plea&s;ing to her fancy; but, determined never to indulge a &s;entiment of partiality without the entire approbation of her parents, &s;he referred him to their deci&s;ion. For particular rea&s;ons, they di&s;approved of his &s;uit. She acquie&s;ced without re&s;erve, and im|mediately

di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him. Who would not rather be a re&s;embler of Florella, than a vain, impru|dent, and ruined Levitia?</P>
<P>"True, indeed, the acquirements and graces of Florella are not attainable by every one; but the virtues of di&s;cretion, mode&s;ty, and kindne&s;s are within the reach of the humble&s;t &s;phere, and the mo&s;t moderate abilities."</P>

<P>"I SHALL now," &s;aid Mrs. Williams, "endeavour to &s;ketch out for you the plan of conduct, which I think will be mo&s;t conducive to your honor and happine&s;s while in a &s;ingle &s;tate. Hitherto you have been under the direc|tion of parents, guardians, and in&s;tructors, who have regulated your deportment, and laboured to give you ju&s;t ideas upon every &s;ubject and oc|ca&s;ion. That period is now over. You are now launching into life, where you will think and act more for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>"The path of rectitude, my dear young friends, is narrow and intricate. Temptations lurk a|round to beguile your feet a&s;tray; and dangers which appear in&s;urmountable will often ari&s;e to affright you from the ways of virtue.</P>
<P>"But remember that a crown of honor and happine&s;s awaits the undeviating pur&s;uit of truth and duty. Let religion be your guide, and di&s;|cretion your handmaid. Thus attended, you
<PB N="49" REF="033748_0047_0FF92796EB866138">
will e&s;cape the &s;nares of youth, and &s;urmount the perplexing cares of more advanced age. At your entrance on the &s;tage of action, the allure|ments of plea&s;ure will &s;pread innumerable charms to court your acceptance. Beware of their fa&s;ci|nating wiles; and whatever cour&s;e you adopt, be &s;ure it is &s;uch as will bear the te&s;t of examina|tion and reflection. Let the&s;e be the criterion of all your pur&s;uits and enjoyments. Make it an invariable practice to re-trace the actions and oc|currences of the day, when you retire to re&s;t; to account with your own hearts for the u&s;e and improvement of the pa&s;t hours; and rectify whatever you find ami&s;s, by greater vigilance and caution, in future; to avoid the errors into which you have fallen, and to di&s;charge the du|ties incumbent upon you.</P>
<P>"To neglect this, will be a &s;ource of great inadvertencies and failings.</P>
<P>"To know your&s;elves, in every particular, mu&s;t be your con&s;tant endeavour. This knowl|edge will lead you to propriety and con&s;i&s;tency of action. But this knowledge cannot be ob|tained without a thorough and repeated in&s;pec|tion of your various pa&s;&s;ions, affections, and pro|pen&s;ities. When obtained, however, it will prevent the ill effects of flattery, by which you will doubtle&s;s be endangered, as you advance into the &s;cenes of fa&s;hionable life. It will ena|ble you to di&s;tingui&s;h flattery from that generous

prai&s;e which is the effu&s;ion of a feeling heart, affected by the perception of real merit. A young lady, un&s;killed in the deceitful arts of a giddy world, is very apt to be mi&s;led by the ad|ulation which is offered at the &s;hrine of vanity. She is con&s;idered as a mark for the wit of every coxcomb, who wi&s;hes to di&s;play his gallantry.</P>
<P>"Flattery is a dazzling meteor, which ca&s;ts a delu&s;ive glare before the eye; and which &s;educes the imagination, perverts the judgment, and &s;i|lences the dictates of &s;ound rea&s;on. Flattery is, therefore, the poi&s;on and bane of the youthful mind. It renders the receiver blind to tho&s;e defects which &s;he ought to &s;ee and rectify, and proud of imaginary graces which &s;he never yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Self-knowledge, as before ob&s;erved, will facilitate the detection of this di&s;gui&s;ed ad|ver&s;ary, by enabling you to inve&s;tigate your real accompli&s;hments and merits.</P>
<P>"That prai&s;e which is the re&s;ult of de&s;erved approbation from tho&s;e, who&s;e good opinion you wi&s;h to enjoy, is worthy your attention and grate|ful acceptance: but the ful&s;ome compliments and hyperbolical profe&s;&s;ions of unmeaning and empty pretenders, calculated only to fill the im|agination with the inflammable air of &s;elf-conceit and arrogant pride, &s;hould be rejected with di&s;|dain, and cordially de&s;pi&s;ed by every lady of &s;en&s;e and &s;entiment, as an in&s;ult upon her under&s;tand|ing, and an indignity to her &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="033748_0049_0FF928B613292E90">"Let it, therefore, be known to tho&s;e who court your favour by an o&s;tentatious parade of admiration and ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, that their di&s;|&s;imulation and duplicity are di&s;covered, and that you are &s;uperior to &s;uch futility.</P>
<P>"In order to di&s;criminate between flattery and merited prai&s;e, critically examine your own heart and life. By this mean you will a&s;certain what is really your due, and what is merely the effect of this in&s;idious art. But let no ideas of your own endowments, however ju&s;t, elate you with an opinion of your &s;uperior powers of plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>"Be not o&s;tentatious of your charms, either of per&s;on or mind. Let mode&s;ty, diffidence, and propriety regulate you, in regard to each. Ex|alted advantages will render you an object of envy to the weak minded of your own &s;ex, and of &s;atire to the ill-natured part of the other. Never obtrude even your real graces and ac|compli&s;hments upon the world.

<L>Some, none re&s;i&s;t, tho' not exceeding fair."</L>
<P>"Beauty, my dear girls, is indeed a de&s;irable quality. Neither the pen of the morali&s;t, nor the &s;pleen of the &s;atyri&s;t, nor the envy of &s;uch as want it, could ever bring it into contempt or neglect.

<P>"Behold the di&s;con&s;olate and de&s;pi&s;ed Flirtil|la! and from her fate learn not to tru&s;t in the effects or duration of this adventitious quality.</P>

Her be&s;t days were &s;pent in the cha&s;e of vanity; and &s;he culled the flowers of life, with|out con&s;idering, that &s;ub&s;tantial fruit would be required at a more advanced period, as a &s;ub&s;ti|tute for the fading blo&s;&s;oms of youth. Her mind was barren of improvement, and con&s;e|quently de&s;titute of re&s;ources.</P>
<P>"She vainly imagined the triumphs of beauty to be permanent, till its declared enemy, the &s;mall-pox, convinced her of the egregious mi&s;|take. By this &s;he found her empire &s;uddenly overturned. The mercile&s;s di&s;order had reduced her to a level with the generality of her &s;ex, in appearance, and, in enjoyment, far below them. Her gla&s;s faithfully repre&s;ented this in&s;upport|able reduction. Regret and chagrin heightened the apparent calamity. She was remembered only as the contra&s;t of what &s;he once had been. Her lovers were di&s;gu&s;ted with the change, and &s;ought more plea&s;ing objects of attention; while men of &s;entiment could not find a &s;imilarity of di&s;po&s;ition, in her, to induce a connexion.</P>
<P>"Her female acquaintance, who had envied her as a rival, or feared her as a &s;uperior, now in&s;ulted her with their pity, or mortified her

<P>"Thought &s;he &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;huns; for &s;he has nothing plea&s;ing to occupy her reflections, but what is irretrievably lo&s;t!</P>
<P>"Mi&s;erable Flirtilla! thou tru&s;ted&s;t in vanity, and vanity is thy recompen&s;e!

<P>"Cultivate, then, my young friends, tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions and attainments, which will yield permanent and real &s;atisfaction, when &s;ickne&s;s, adver&s;ity, or age &s;hall have robbed your eyes of their lu&s;tre, and dimini&s;hed the bloom and &s;pright|line&s;s of your forms.</P>

<PB N="59" REF="033748_0057_0FF928D3F4EBA738">
is capable of very little in it&s;elf. To look with a grudging and evil eye on the enjoyments of our neighbour, mu&s;t be a &s;ource of perpetual chagrin and mortification.</P>
<P>"Envy indulged, is a puni&s;hment to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Eradicate, then, the fir&s;t, and every emotion of &s;o corroding and de&s;tructive a nature; and en|deavour to excel only by that virtuous emulation, which is productive of improvement and re&s;pec|tability.</P>

<HEAD>Wednesday, P. M. DRESS.</HEAD>
<P>"DRESS" continued Mrs. Williams to her re-a&s;&s;embled and attentive pupils, "is an important article of female economy. By &s;ome it is doubt|le&s;s con&s;idered as too e&s;&s;ential. This is always the ca&s;e, when it becomes the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and every other excellence is made &s;ubordinate to it. A &s;uitable attention to the etiquette of appear|ance is nece&s;&s;ary to render us re&s;pectable in the eyes of the world; and di&s;covers an accommodat|ing di&s;po&s;ition, which is, at once, engaging and u&s;eful in the commerce of &s;ociety. Females are taxed with being peculiarly attached to, and cap|tivated by the glare of &s;plendor and &s;how. But I believe &s;uperficial minds are not confined to &s;ex. Whatever form they actuate, to beautify and adorn it will be the principal object.</P>
<P>"A certain &s;pecies of gaiety and airine&s;s is be|coming in youth. Young ladies, therefore, act perfectly in character, when, under proper re|&s;traint, they indulge their ta&s;te in the decora|tion of their per&s;ons. But they &s;hould be e&s;|pecially careful that their ta&s;te be correct; con|&s;i&s;tent with the mode&s;t delicacy which is the glo|ry and ornament of woman.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="033748_0060_0FF928E1B6EB5B50">"It is laudable to follow fa&s;hions, &s;o far as they are governed by the&s;e rules; but whenever they deviate, quit them with expre&s;s di&s;approba|tion and di&s;gu&s;t. Any a&s;&s;umptions of the ma&s;|culine habit are unbecoming. Dre&s;s and man|ners &s;hould be corre&s;pondent; and the engaging &s;oftne&s;s and artle&s;s &s;implicity, which grace my pupils, mu&s;t be quite incon&s;i&s;tent with the air and attire of the other &s;ex.</P>
<P>"A gaudy and fanta&s;tical mode of decoration is by no means a recommendation. It be&s;peaks a lightne&s;s of mind and a vanity of di&s;po&s;ition, again&s;t which a di&s;creet and mode&s;t girl &s;hould guard with the utmo&s;t vigilance. Extrava|gance is a great error, even where fortune will allow the means of &s;upporting it. Many are the claims which the children of affliction and want have upon the &s;uperfluous plenty of the rich. How much better expended would &s;ome part of their redundance be, in relieving the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;uch, than in decorating their own per&s;ons, with every ornament which art can contrive to create expen&s;e!</P>
<P>"Neatne&s;s and propriety &s;hould be the main objects; for loveline&s;s needs no foreign aid to give it a pa&s;&s;port. Neatne&s;s is too often connect|ed with the idea of a prudi&s;h &s;ingularity; but no gaudine&s;s of apparel, no richne&s;s of attire, no modi&s;hne&s;s of appearance can be an equivalent for it. Propriety is that garb which becomes our
<PB N="63" REF="033748_0061_0FF928E7703B32D0">
&s;ituation and circum&s;tances in life. There cer|tainly ought to be a difference between different ages and conditions, in this re&s;pect. Many arti|cles, ornamental to Mi&s;s in her teens, would ap|pear ab&s;urd, fanta&s;tical, and ridiculous in maturer years. Neither &s;hould the matronal robes, and the clo&s;e cap hide the natural ringlets, and ea&s;y &s;hapes of the blooming girl.</P>
<P>"It is a very fal&s;e ta&s;te which induces people in dependent and narrow circum&s;tances, to imi|tate the expen&s;ive mode of dre&s;s which might be very decent for tho&s;e who move in a higher &s;phere.</P>
<P>"To endeavour to conceal indigence by the af|fectation of extravagance, is committing a great offence, both again&s;t our&s;elves, and the communi|ty to which we belong. The means of &s;upport &s;hould always be attended to. A conformity to the&s;e will render you more re&s;pected for prudence, than a deviation for the &s;ake of &s;how without &s;ub&s;tance, can make you admired.</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a and Clarinda are &s;triking examples. They were both the daughters of reputable pa|rents, who&s;e &s;ituations in the world were ea&s;y and comfortable, though not affluent. They were able to give their children a good education, but no other portion. Gay, volatile, and ambitious, Loui&s;a was the votary of fa&s;hion. A &s;uperior in dre&s;s excited the keene&s;t &s;en&s;ations of envy in her bo&s;om; and a rival in appearance gave
<PB N="64" REF="033748_0062_0FF8C6185769AAE8">
her un&s;peakable mortification. Di&s;&s;atisfied with her natural charms, co&s;metics and paints added to her expen&s;es, and betrayed her folly. She had many profe&s;&s;ed admirers, who found her a willing dupe to flattery, and who rai&s;ed her vanity by prai&s;ing her excellent ta&s;te.</P>
<P>"Leander, a gentleman of liberal education, &s;uperior merit, and hand&s;ome property, ca&s;t his eye around for a companion to &s;hare and enjoy the&s;e advantages with him. Loui&s;a caught his attention. The elegance of her per&s;on, and &s;plendor of her appearance, charmed his imagination, and in&s;pired the idea of a fortune &s;ufficient to &s;upport her expen&s;ive &s;tyle of living. He paid his addre&s;&s;es, and was received with the mo&s;t flattering encouragement. But how great was his di&s;appointment, when he di&s;covered the &s;mallne&s;s of her re&s;ources, and the impru|dence of her management! This, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, will never do for me. Were my income far &s;uperior to what it is, it would not be ade|quate to &s;uch unbounded extravagance. Be&s;ides, where &s;o little economy is practi&s;ed, while under parental government, what mu&s;t be the con&s;e|quence of that unlimited indulgence, which the confidence due to a wife demands? Were I to abridge her expen&s;es, and endeavour to rectify her fanta&s;tical ta&s;te, it would doubtle&s;s foment di&s;|&s;en&s;ion, di&s;cord, and animo&s;ity, which mu&s;t ter|minate
<PB N="65" REF="033748_0063_0FF928EC7A766288">
in wretchedne&s;s. He re&s;olved, however, to try her real di&s;po&s;ition, by gently hinting his di&s;approbation of her gaiety. This &s;he re&s;ented; and a rupture, which ended in a final &s;eparation, en&s;ued. She found, too late, the value of the man, whom &s;he had &s;lighted; and ever after re|gretted that folly which had irretrievably alien|ated his affections.</P>
<P>"The mode&s;ty and neatne&s;s of Clarinda's garb next caught Leander's eye. Conver&s;ing with her on the &s;ubject of dre&s;s, the ju&s;tne&s;s of her &s;enti|ments gave him the highe&s;t ideas of the rectitude and innocence of her mind. A co&s;tly article was offered for her purcha&s;e; but &s;he refu&s;ed it. It would not become me, &s;aid &s;he, nor any other per&s;on who has not an affluent fortune. If I had a &s;ufficiency to buy it, I would procure &s;ome|thing more &s;imple and nece&s;&s;ary for my&s;elf; and the overplus might render an object of di&s;tre&s;s contented and happy.</P>
<P>"Yet was Clarinda always elegantly neat; always genteelly fa&s;hionable. Frugality and econ|omy, free from profu&s;ion and extravagance, ena|bled her to indulge her own ta&s;te entirely; and while &s;he enjoyed that, &s;he repined not at the fancied &s;uperiority of others. Leander found her all he wi&s;hed, in appearance; all he hoped for, in reality. As their ta&s;tes were corre&s;pond|ent, and their highe&s;t aim, when united, to plea&s;e
<PB N="66" REF="033748_0064_0FF928F232C79A70">
each other, they were not dependent on the breath of fa&s;hion for their happine&s;s. A com|pliance with its forms did not elate their pride, nor a departure from them, fill their hearts with peevi&s;hne&s;s and di&s;content."</P>

<HEAD>Thursday, A. M. POLITENESS.</HEAD>
<P>"STILL more important than your habit, is your air and deportment. It is not &s;ufficient that the&s;e are plea&s;ing to the eye of the &s;uperfi|cial ob&s;erver. Your behaviour and conver&s;ation mu&s;t be uniformly governed by the laws of politene&s;s, di&s;cretion, and decorum. El&s;e you will be di&s;gu&s;ting to people of refinement; and the judicious and di&s;cerning will di&s;cover the weakne&s;s of your minds, notwith&s;tanding the &s;howy ornaments, intended to conceal it from public view.</P>
<P>"Inattention in company is a breach of good manners. Indeed, it is a downright in&s;ult; being neither more nor le&s;s, than declaring that you have not the lea&s;t re&s;pect for any who are pre&s;ent. Either you do not value their good opinion, or you have &s;omething more important than their conver&s;ation to occupy your minds.</P>
<P>"You &s;hould always be attentive to tho&s;e with whom you are conver&s;ant, let their rank and &s;tanding be what they may. Your &s;uperiors will e&s;teem you for your re&s;pectful treatment of them; your equals will love you for your kind|ne&s;s
<PB N="68" REF="033748_0066_0FF929074FBC59D0">
and familiarity; your inferiors will re&s;pect you for your conde&s;cen&s;ion and meekne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Attention in company will be advantageous to your&s;elves. Like the indu&s;trious bee, which &s;ips honey from every plant, you may derive &s;ome benefit or in&s;truction from all kinds of &s;ociety. Some u&s;eful remark or information; &s;ome &s;entiment which may allure you to the practice of virtue, or deter you from a vicious perpetration, may repay your labour, and be &s;erviceable through life.</P>
<P>"But &s;hould there be no other motive than that of plea&s;ing your a&s;&s;ociates, and rendering them happy, by making your&s;elves agreeable, it may be con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient inducement to the practice of this branch of good-breeding. Many girls, in the thoughtle&s;s levity of their hearts, divert them&s;elves at the expen&s;e of others; and, with the utmo&s;t glee, point out any thing pecu|liar in the appearance, words, or actions of &s;ome one in the company, whom they &s;elect for a &s;ub|ject of merriment and ridicule. This, by &s;hrewd looks, ironical ge&s;tures, or tittering whi&s;pers, is kept up, to the great mortification of the unhappy victim, and to the reproach and di&s;honor of the offenders. Such conduct is a breach, not only of the rules of common civility, but of humanity; be&s;ides being directly repugnant to the precept of doing to others as we would that they &s;hould do to us.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="033748_0067_0FF9290AE2906768">"Be particularly careful, then, not to mortify, or give pain to an inferior.</P>
<P>"Let the que&s;tion, "who maketh thee to differ?" &s;uppre&s;s every emotion of ridicule, con|tempt, or neglect; and induce you to rai&s;e and encourage depre&s;&s;ed merit by your notice and approbation.</P>
<P>"As far as propriety, delicacy, and virtue will allow, conform to the ta&s;te, and participate in the amu&s;ements and conver&s;ation of the company into which you have fallen. If they be di&s;agree|ble to you, avoid a &s;upercilious avowal of your di&s;like. This, in&s;tead of reforming, would prob|ably give them a di&s;gu&s;t to you, and perhaps &s;ubject you to affronts. Yet where a di&s;appro|bating word or hint may be &s;ea&s;onable, neglect not the opportunity of contributing to their ben|efit and amendment.</P>
<P>"Are you con&s;cious of &s;uperior advantages, either mental or external, make no o&s;tentatious di&s;play of them. Vanity too often leads young ladies to obtrude their acquirements on the eyes of ob&s;ervers, incon&s;iderately apprehending they may otherwi&s;e be unnoticed. Such forwardne&s;s always &s;ubjects them to cen&s;ure, ridicule, and envy; the expre&s;&s;ions of which de&s;troy that &s;elf-approbation which retiring merit invariably enjoys. However, exert that dignity of virtue which will render you independent of caprice, calumny, and unprovoked &s;atire.</P>

<P>"Of this the unhappy, though imprudent Eu|docia, is an exemplification.</P>
<P>"Eudocia was young, gay&punc; and charming. A levity of di&s;po&s;ition, which the innocence of her heart attempted not to re&s;train, &s;ometimes gave the tongue of &s;lander pretence to aim its enven|omed &s;hafts at her character, and to mi&s;repre|&s;ent her &s;prightline&s;s.</P>
<P>"Independent in fortune; &s;till more &s;o in mind, calumny gave her no pain, while &s;he was con&s;cious of the rectitude of her intentions.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="033748_0069_0FF929124FB8B820">"Leontine was a gentleman of property; agreeable in his per&s;on and manners; of &s;trict honor, and extremely tenacious of it; but of a &s;evere and unforgiving temper. He paid his addre&s;&s;es to Eudocia; was accepted, approved, and beloved. Yet, though he had gained her affections, he had not &s;ufficient influence to regulate her conduct, and repre&s;s her gaiety. Her fondne&s;s for &s;how and gallantry, in &s;ome in|&s;tances, induced her to countenance the atten|tions, and receive the flattery, of men, who&s;e characters were exceptionable, in Leontine's e&s;|timation. He remon&s;trated again&s;t her impru|dence, and gave her his ideas of female delicacy. She laughed at his gravity, and rallied him on his implicit &s;ubjection to the opinions of others.</P>
<P>"Towards the clo&s;e of a fine day, Eudocia rambled along a retired road, to enjoy the air. She was alone; but the hope of meeting her beloved Leontine, whom &s;he expected that even|ing, imperceptibly led her beyond her intended excur&s;ion. The rattling of a carriage cau&s;ed her to &s;top; and, thinking it to be Leontine's, &s;he ap|proached it before &s;he perceived her mi&s;take. A gentleman of an elegant appearance alighted, and acco&s;ting her politely, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e at finding her &s;o far from home without an at|tendant. She found it was Florio, with whom &s;he had a &s;light acquaintance, having once met with him in company. She frankly owned her
<PB N="72" REF="033748_0070_0FF929284EC8F150">
motive for walking thus far; and refu&s;ed his in|vitation to return in his carriage. He renewed his reque&s;t; and his importunity, &s;econded by her fatigue, at la&s;t prevailed. At this moment the detracting Lavina pa&s;&s;ed by. She &s;aw Eu|docia, and with a &s;neering &s;mile, wi&s;hed her a good night. Eudocia was uncon&s;cious of fault, and therefore fearle&s;s of cen&s;ure. But the art|ful Florio, de&s;irous of protracting the plea&s;ure of her company, took a circuitous route, which con&s;iderably increa&s;ed the di&s;tance to her father's hou&s;e. However, he conveyed her &s;afely home, though not &s;o &s;oon as &s;he wi&s;hed. She found that Leontine had been there, and had gone to vi&s;it a friend; but would &s;oon return. Leon|tine was ju&s;t &s;eated at his friend's, when Lavina entered.</P>
<P>"She told the circle, that Florio had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed her, and that he had company &s;he little expected to &s;ee with him. They inquired if it was his former mi&s;tre&s;s? No, &s;aid &s;he, he has di&s;carded her &s;ome time ago, and if we may judge by appearances, has cho&s;en a new one. Upon being a&s;ked who, &s;he pre&s;umed to name Eudocia. Every countenance expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e and regret. In Leontine's, rage and re&s;entment were vi&s;ibly depicted. He ro&s;e, and &s;tepping ha&s;tily to Lavina, told her he was a party con|cerned, and demanded an explanation of what &s;he had in&s;inuated. She perceived that &s;he had
<PB N="73" REF="033748_0071_0FF92942D0B008A0">
given offence, and endeavoured to excu&s;e her|&s;elf; but he re&s;olutely told her that no eva&s;ions would avail; that he in&s;i&s;ted on the real truth of her &s;candalous report. Finding him thus deter|mined, &s;he related the &s;imple fact of &s;eeing Eu|docia in a carriage with Florio, who was a known libertine, and accu&s;tomed to the &s;ociety of loo&s;e women. Leontine a&s;ked her how &s;he came to a&s;&s;ociate the ideas &s;he had mentioned with Eudo|cia's name? She replied that the lightne&s;s of her behaviour had &s;ometimes rendered her cen&s;urable; and &s;he thought this in&s;tance, in particular, au|thorized &s;u&s;picion. Leontine could not deny that &s;he was culpable in appearance; yet made an|&s;wer, that though &s;candal might fea&s;t on the failings of virtue, he believed Eudocia's inno|cence much purer, and her heart much better than her detracters'; and, taking his hat, he wi&s;h|ed the company a good evening, and left them.</P>
<P>"His pa&s;&s;ions were on fire. He could not comprehend the my&s;terious conduct of Eudocia. Her ab&s;ence from home, at a time when he ex|pected her to receive him, and her being &s;een at a di&s;tance, in company with a profe&s;&s;ed deb|auchee, were a labyrinth which he could not ex|plore. Though he doubted not Eudocia's honor, yet her folly and imprudence, in &s;ubjecting her character to &s;u&s;picion and reproach, he thought unpardonable. His re&s;entment determined him to break the propo&s;ed connexion immediately;
<PB N="74" REF="033748_0072_0FF9296138172180">
and, le&s;t his love &s;hould get the better of his re&s;|olution, he went directly to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"As he could not command his temper, he appeared extremely agitated, and angrily told Eudocia that &s;he had cau&s;ed him great unea&s;i|ne&s;s; and that he came to claim the &s;atisfaction of knowing, why &s;he had avoided his &s;ociety, and made an a&s;&s;ignation with a man who had involved her in infamy? Eudocia was a&s;toni&s;hed, and ju&s;tly offended at this addre&s;s. With all the dignity of con&s;cious innocence, &s;he replied, that as yet he had no right to challenge an ac|count of her conduct; but for her own &s;ake, &s;he would conde&s;cend to give it. This &s;he did, by a faithful and undi&s;gui&s;ed relation of facts. She then a&s;ked him, if he was &s;atisfied. He an&s;wered, No. For, &s;aid he, though you have cleared your&s;elf of guilt, in my apprehen&s;ion, you will find it very difficult to free your char|acter from the blemi&s;h it has received in the opinion of the world. Saying this, he told her, that, however highly he e&s;teemed her, &s;o oppo|&s;ite were their di&s;po&s;itions, that they mu&s;t often be at variance; and &s;o nice was his &s;en&s;e of honor, that his wife, like Cae&s;ar's, mu&s;t not only be virtuous, but un&s;u&s;pected. She rejoined, that his &s;entiments were apparent; and if what he then expre&s;&s;ed were his opinion of her, it was be&s;t they &s;hould part.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="033748_0073_0FF929734537EC18">"Some further conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed; when, promi&s;ing to call, the next day, and &s;atisfy her pa|rents, and wi&s;hing Eudocia all po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s in life, he took his leave.</P>
<P>"The impropriety of her conduct, and her lo&s;ing the affections of a man &s;he too ardently loved, together with the cruel treatment &s;he had ju&s;t received from him, overwhelmed her with grief, and produced the mo&s;t violent emotions of regret. She walked her room in all the an|gui&s;h of di&s;appointed hope. Her parents u&s;ed every argument to &s;oothe and con&s;ole her; but in vain.</P>
<P>"She yielded to their per&s;ua&s;ions &s;o far as to retire to bed; but re&s;t &s;he found not; and the morning pre&s;ented her in a burning fever. Le|ontine called in the cour&s;e of the day; but the friends of Eudocia refu&s;ed to &s;ee him. An ac|count of her di&s;order had rou&s;ed him to a &s;en&s;e of his ra&s;hne&s;s, and he begged to be admitted to her chamber; but this &s;he utterly denied.</P>

At that time &s;he was at nur&s;e in a neighbouring village; between which and the metropolis, all communication being cut off, he was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving her to the mercy of tho&s;e to whom &s;he was entru&s;t|ed. Having received her from pecuniary mo|tives only, they no &s;ooner found them&s;elves de|prived of the profits of their labour and care, than they &s;ought relief by an application to the town for her &s;upport.

At his hou&s;e, &s;he was brought up in a homely, though comfortable manner. The good man and his wife were exce&s;&s;ively fond of her, and gave her every in&s;truction and advantage in their power. Plain truths were liberally inculcated, and every exertion made to give her a habit of indu&s;try and good nature. Flavia requited their kindne&s;s by an obliging and cheerful, a docile and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deportment. As &s;he advanced in years, &s;he increa&s;ed in beauty.

<P>"In this &s;tate, Flavia was happy. Health and innocence were now her portion; nor had am|bition as yet taught her to &s;igh for plea&s;ures be|yond the reach of her attainment.</P>
<P>"But the arrival of her father, who had been permitted to return, and re-po&s;&s;e&s;s the e&s;tate which he had abandoned, put a period to the &s;implicity and peace of Flavia's mind.

<P>"THE filial and fraternal are the fir&s;t du|ties of a &s;ingle &s;tate. The obligations you are under to your parents cannot be di&s;charged, but by a uniform and cheerful obedience; an unre|&s;erved and ready compliance with their wi&s;hes, added to the mo&s;t diligent attention to their ea&s;e and happine&s;s. The virtuous and affectionate be|haviour of children is the be&s;t compen&s;ation, in their power, for that unwearied care and &s;olici|tude which parents, only, know. Upon daugh|ters, who&s;e &s;ituation and employments lead them more frequently into &s;cenes of dome&s;tic tender|ne&s;s; who are often called to &s;mooth the pillow of &s;ick and aged parents, and to admini&s;ter with a &s;kilful and delicate hand the cordial, re&s;tora|tive to decaying nature, an endearing &s;en&s;ibility, and a dutiful acquie&s;ence in the di&s;po&s;itions, and even peculiarities of tho&s;e from whom they have derived exi&s;tence, are indi&s;pen&s;ably incumbent.</P>
<P>"Such a conduct will yield a &s;atisfaction of mind more than equivalent to any little &s;acri|fices

<L>Explore the thought, explain the a&s;king eye,</L>
<L>And keep awhile one parent from the &s;ky!"</L>
<P>"Next in rank and importance to filial piety, is fraternal love. This is a natural affection which you cannot too a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivate. How de|lightful to &s;ee children of the &s;ame family dwell together in unity; promoting each other's wel|fare, and emulous only to excel in acts of kind|ne&s;s and good will.

Here &s;he painted, in the mo&s;t lively colours, the heinou&s;ne&s;s of her offence, and the ignominy and wretchedne&s;s that awaited her. Her affection allured, her rea&s;oning convinced her back&s;liding &s;i&s;ter.

<HEAD>Friday, P. M. FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>"FRIENDSHIP is a term, much in&s;i&s;ted on by young people; but, like many others, more frequently u&s;ed than under&s;tood. A friend, with girls in general, is an intimate acquaintance, who&s;e ta&s;te and plea&s;ures are &s;imilar to their own; who will encourage, or at lea&s;t connive at their foibles and faults, and communicate with them every &s;ecret; in particular tho&s;e of love and gal|lantry, in which tho&s;e of the other &s;ex are con|cerned. By &s;uch friends, their errors and &s;trata|gems are flattered and concealed, while the pru|dent advice of real friend&s;hip is neglected, till they find, too late, how fictitious a character, and how vain a dependence they have cho&s;en.</P>
<P>"Augu&s;ta and Serena were educated at the &s;ame &s;chool, re&s;ided in the &s;ame neighbourhood, and were equally volatile in their tempers, and di&s;&s;ipated in their manners. Hence every plan of amu&s;ement was concerted and enjoyed to|gether. At the play, the ball, the card-table, and every other party of plea&s;ure, they were companions.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="033748_0088_0FF92A8C1F900C30">"Their parents &s;aw that this intimacy &s;trength|ened the follies of each; and &s;trove to di&s;engage their affections, that they might turn their atten|tion to more rational entertainments, and more judicious advi&s;ers. But they gloried in their friend&s;hip, and thought it a &s;ub&s;titute for every other virtue. They were the dupes of adulation, and the votaries of coquetry.</P>
<P>"The attentions of a libertine, in&s;tead of put|ting them on their guard again&s;t encroachments, induced them to triumph in their fancied con|que&s;ts, and to boa&s;t of re&s;olution &s;ufficient to &s;hield them from delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Love, however, which, with &s;uch di&s;po&s;i|tions, is the pretty play-thing of imagination, a&s;|&s;ailed the tender heart of Serena. A gay youth, with more wit than &s;en&s;e, more &s;how than &s;ub|&s;tance, more art than hone&s;ty, took advantage of her weakne&s;s to ingratiate him&s;elf into her favour, and per&s;uade her they could not live without each other. Augu&s;ta was the confident of Sere|na. She fanned the flame, and encouraged her re&s;olution of promoting her own felicity, though at the expen&s;e of every other duty. Her parents &s;u&s;pected her amour, remon&s;trated again&s;t the man, and forbad her forming any connexion with him, on pain of their di&s;plea&s;ure. She ap|parently acquie&s;ced; but flew to Augu&s;ta for coun&s;el and relief. Augu&s;ta &s;oothed her anxiety, and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the accompli&s;hment
<PB N="91" REF="033748_0089_0FF92A9C1522D7C8">
of all her wi&s;hes. She accordingly contrived means for a clande&s;tine intercour&s;e, both per&s;on|al and epi&s;tolary.</P>
<P>"Ari&s;tus was a foreigner, and avowed his pur|po&s;e of returning to his native country, urging her to accompany him. Serena had a fortune, independent of her parents, left her by a decea&s;ed relation. This, with her hand, &s;he con&s;ented to give to her lover, and to quit a country, in which &s;he acknowledged but one friend. Augu&s;ta prai&s;|ed her fortitude, and favoured her de&s;ign. She accordingly eloped and embarked. Her parents were almo&s;t di&s;tracted by her imprudent and undutiful conduct; and their re&s;entment fell on Augu&s;ta, who had acted contrary to all the dic|tates of integrity and friend&s;hip, in contributing to her ruin; for ruin it proved. Her ungrate|ful paramour, having rioted on the property which &s;he be&s;towed, abandoned her to want and de&s;pair. She wrote to her parents, but received no an&s;wer. She repre&s;ented her ca&s;e to Augu&s;|ta, and implored relief from her friend&s;hip; but Augu&s;ta alleged that &s;he had already incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of her family on her account, and cho&s;e not again to &s;ubject her&s;elf to cen&s;ure by the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>"Serena at length returned to her native &s;hore, and applied in per&s;on to Augu&s;ta, who coolly told her that &s;he wi&s;hed no intercour&s;e with a vagabond, and then retired. Her parents refu&s;ed
<PB N="92" REF="033748_0090_0FF92AA894EEBFD8">
to receive her into their hou&s;e; but, from mo|tives of compa&s;&s;ion and charity, granted her a &s;mall annuity, barely &s;ufficient to keep her and her infant from want.</P>
<P>"Too late &s;he di&s;covered her mi&s;taken notions of friend&s;hip; and learned by &s;ad experience, that virtue mu&s;t be its foundation, or &s;incerity and con&s;tancy can never be its reward.</P>
<P>"Sincerity and con&s;tancy are e&s;&s;ential ingre|dients in virtuous friend&s;hip. It invariably &s;eeks the permanent good of its object; and in &s;o doing, will advi&s;e, caution and reprove, with all the frankne&s;s of undi&s;&s;embled affection. In the interchange of genuine friend&s;hip, flattery is ut|terly excluded. Yet, even in the mo&s;t intimate connexions of this kind, a proper degree of re|&s;pect, attention, and politene&s;s, mu&s;t be ob&s;erved. You are not &s;o far to pre&s;ume on the partiality of friend&s;hip, as to hazard giving offence, and wounding the feelings of per&s;ons, merely becau&s;e you think their regard for you will plead your excu&s;e, and procure your pardon. Equally cau|tious &s;hould you be, of taking umbrage at cir|cum&s;tances which are unde&s;ignedly offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>"Hear the excellent advice of the wi&s;e &s;on of Sirach, upon this &s;ubject:</P>
<P>"Admoni&s;h thy friend; it may be he hath not done it; and if he have done it, that he do it no more. Admoni&s;h thy friend; it may be he hath not &s;aid it; and if he have, that he
<PB N="93" REF="033748_0091_0FF8C681058F37C0">
&s;peak it not again. Admoni&s;h thy friend; for many times it is a &s;lander; and believe not every tale. There is one that &s;lippeth in his &s;peech, but not from his heart; and who is he that of|fendeth not with his tongue?"</P>
<P>"Be not ha&s;ty in forming friend&s;hips; but deliberately examine the principles, di&s;po&s;ition, temper, and manners, of the per&s;on you wi&s;h to &s;u&s;tain this important character. Be well a&s;&s;ured that they are agreeable to your own, and &s;uch as merit your entire e&s;teem and confidence, before you denominate her your friend. You may have many general acquaintances, with whom you are plea&s;ed and entertained; but in the chain of friend&s;hip there is a &s;till clo&s;er link.</P>
<L>"Re&s;erve will wound it, and di&s;tru&s;t de&s;troy.</L>
<L>Deliberate on all things with thy friend:</L>
<L>But &s;ince friends grow not thick on ev'ry bough,</L>
<L>Nor ev'ry friend unrotten at the core,</L>
<L>Fir&s;t, on thy friend, deliberate with thy&s;elf:</L>
<L>Pau&s;e, ponder, &s;ift; not eager in the choice,</L>
<L>Nor jealous of the cho&s;en: fixing, fix:</L>
<L>Judge before friend&s;hip; then confide till death."</L>
<P>"But, if you would have friends, you mu&s;t &s;how your&s;elves friendly; that is, you mu&s;t be careful to act the part you wi&s;h from another. If your friend have faults, mildly and tenderly repre&s;ent them to <HI>her</HI>; but conceal them as much as po&s;&s;ible from the ob&s;ervation of the world. Endeavour to convince her of her errors, to
<PB N="94" REF="033748_0092_0FF92AC3124C0D30">
rectify her mi&s;takes, and to confirm and increa&s;e every virtuous &s;entiment.</P>
<P>"Should &s;he &s;o far deviate, as to endanger her reputation and happine&s;s; and &s;hould your ad|monitions fail to reclaim her, become not, like Augu&s;ta, an abettor of her crimes. It is not the part of friend&s;hip to hide tran&s;actions which will end in the ruin of your friend. Rather acquaint tho&s;e who ought to have the rule over her of her intended mi&s;teps, and you will have di&s;charged your duty; you will merit, and very probably may afterwards receive, her thanks.</P>
<P>"Narci&s;&s;a and Florinda were united in the bonds of true and generous friend&s;hip. Narci&s;&s;a was called to &s;pend a few months with a relation in the metropolis, where &s;he became acquainted with, and attached to a man who was much her inferior; but who&s;e &s;pecious manners and ap|pearance deceived her youthful heart, though her rea&s;on and judgment informed her, that her parents would di&s;approve the connexion. When &s;he returned home, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her fault, the frankne&s;s which &s;he owed to her friend, and her partiality to her lover, wrought powerfully upon her mind, and rendered her melancholy. Florinda &s;oon explored the cau&s;e, and warmly re|mon&s;trated again&s;t her imprudence in holding a moment's intercour&s;e with a man, who, &s;he knew, would be di&s;plea&s;ing to her parents. She &s;earched out his character, and found it far inadequate to
<PB N="95" REF="033748_0093_0FF92AC637547978">
Narci&s;&s;a's merit. This &s;he repre&s;ented to her in its true colours, and conjured her not to &s;acrifice her reputation, her duty, and her happine&s;s, by encouraging his addre&s;&s;es: but to no purpo&s;e were her expo&s;tulations. Narci&s;&s;a avowed the de&s;ign of permitting him to &s;olicit the con&s;ent of her parents, and the determination of marrying him without it, if they refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Florinda was alarmed at this re&s;olution; and, with painful anxiety, &s;aw the danger of her friend. She told her plainly, that the regard &s;he had for her demanded a counteraction of her de&s;ign; and that if &s;he found no other way of preventing its execution, &s;he &s;hould di&s;charge her duty by informing her parents of her proceed|ings. This Narci&s;&s;a re&s;ented, and immediately withdrew her confidence and familiarity; but the faithful Florinda neglected not the watchful &s;olicitude of friend&s;hip; and when &s;he perceived that Narci&s;&s;a's family were re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed to her projected match, and that Narci&s;&s;a was pre|paring to put her ra&s;h purpo&s;e into execution, &s;he made known the plan which &s;he had concerted, and by that mean prevented her de&s;truction. Narci&s;&s;a thought her&s;elf greatly injured, and de|clared that &s;he would never forgive &s;o flagrant a breach of fidelity. Florinda endeavoured to con|vince her of her good intentions, and the real kindne&s;s of her motives; but &s;he refu&s;ed to hear the voice of wi&s;dom, till a &s;eparation from her

lover, and a full proof of his unworthine&s;s, opened her eyes to a &s;ight of her own folly and indi&s;cretion, and to a lively &s;en&s;e of Florinda's friend&s;hip, in &s;aving her from ruin without her con&s;ent. Her heart overflowed with gratitude to her generous pre&s;erver. She acknowledged her|&s;elf indebted to Florinda's benevolence, for de|liverance from the baneful impetuo&s;ity of her own pa&s;&s;ions.

<HEAD>Saturday, A. M. LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>"THE highe&s;t &s;tate of friend&s;hip which this life admits, is in the conjugal relation. On this refined affection, love, which is but a more intere&s;ting and tender kind of friend&s;hip, ought to be founded. The &s;ame virtues, the &s;ame di&s;|po&s;itions and qualities which are nece&s;&s;ary in a friend, are &s;till more requi&s;ite in a companion for life. And when the&s;e enlivening principles are united, they form the ba&s;is of durable happine&s;s. But let not the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, or of love, de|ceive you. You are now entering upon a new &s;tage of action, where you will probably admire, and be admired. You may attract the notice of many, who will &s;elect you, as objects of adula|tion, to di&s;cover their ta&s;te and gallantry; and perhaps of &s;ome who&s;e affections you have really and &s;eriou&s;ly engaged. The fir&s;t cla&s;s your pen|etration will enable you to detect; and your good &s;en&s;e and virtue will lead you to treat them with the neglect they de&s;erve. It is di&s;reputable for a young lady to receive and encourage the officious attentions of tho&s;e mere plea&s;ure-hunters, who
<PB N="98" REF="033748_0096_0FF92ACF5985C870">
rove from fair to fair, with no other de&s;ign than the exerci&s;e of their art, addre&s;s, and intrigue. Nothing can render their company plea&s;ing, but a vanity of being care&s;&s;ed, and a fal&s;e pride in being thought an object of general admiration, with a fondne&s;s for flattery which be&s;peaks a vi|tiated mind. But when you are addre&s;&s;ed by a per&s;on of real merit, who is worthy your e&s;teem, and may ju&s;tly demand your re&s;pect, let him be treated with honor, frankne&s;s, and &s;incerity. It is the part of a prude, to affect a &s;hyne&s;s, re|&s;erve, and indifference, foreign to the heart. Innocence and virtue will ri&s;e &s;uperior to &s;uch little arts, and indulge no wi&s;h which needs di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>"Still more unworthy are the in&s;idious and deluding wiles of the coquette. How di&s;gu&s;ting mu&s;t this character appear to per&s;ons of &s;enti|ment and integrity! how unbecoming the deli|cacy and dignity of an uncorrupted female!</P>
<P>"As you are young and inexperienced, your affections may po&s;&s;ibly be involuntarily engaged, where prudence and duty forbid a connexion. Beware, then, how you admit the pa&s;&s;ion of love. In young minds, it is of all others the mo&s;t un|controllable. When fancy takes the reins, it compels its blinded votary to &s;acrifice rea&s;on, di&s;cretion and con&s;cience to its impetuous dic|tates. But a pa&s;&s;ion of this origin tends not to &s;ub&s;tantial and durable happine&s;s. To &s;ecure
<PB N="99" REF="033748_0097_0FF8C68B2A06BA60">
this, it mu&s;t be quite of another kind, enkindled by e&s;teem, founded on merit, &s;trengthened by congenial di&s;po&s;itions and corre&s;ponding virtues, and terminating in the mo&s;t pure and refined affection.</P>
<P>"Never &s;uffer your eyes to be charmed by the mere exterior; nor delude your&s;elves with the notion of unconquerable love. The eye, in this re&s;pect, is often deceptious, and fills the imagi|nation with charms which have no reality. Nip, in the bud, every particular liking, much more all ideas of love, till called forth by unequivocal tokens, as well as profe&s;&s;ions of &s;incere regard. Even then, harbour them not without a thorough knowledge of the temper, di&s;po&s;ition, and cir|cum&s;tances of your lover, the advice of your friends; and, above all, the approbation of your parents. Maturely weigh every con&s;ideration for and again&s;t, and deliberately determine with your&s;elves, what will be mo&s;t conducive to your welfare and felicity in life. Let a rational and di&s;creet plan of thinking and acting, regulate your deportment, and render you de&s;erving of the af|fection you wi&s;h to in&s;ure. This you will find far more conducive to your intere&s;t, than the indulgence of that romantic pa&s;&s;ion, which a blind and mi&s;guided fancy paints in &s;uch al|luring colours, to the thoughtle&s;s and inexpe|rienced.</P>

<P>"A union, formed without a refined and gen|erous affection for its ba&s;is, mu&s;t be devoid of tho&s;e tender endearments, reciprocal attentions, and engaging &s;ympathies, which are peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to alleviate the cares, di&s;pel the &s;or|rows, and &s;often the pains of life. The exerci&s;e of that prudence and caution which I have recommended, will lead you to a thorough inve&s;tigation of the character and views of the man by whom you are addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Without good principles, both of religion and morality, (for the latter cannot exi&s;t independent of the former) you cannot &s;afely rely, either upon his fidelity or his affection. Good prin|ciples are the foundation of a good life.</P>

<P>"Next to this, an amiable temper is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite. A proud, a pa&s;&s;ionate, a revengeful, a malicious, or a jealous temper, will render your lives uncomfortable, in &s;pite of all the pru|dence and fortitude you can exert.</P>
<P>"Beware, then, le&s;t, before marriage, love blind your eyes to tho&s;e defects, to a &s;ight of which, grief and di&s;appointment may awaken you after|wards. You are to con&s;ider marriage as a con|nexion for life; as the neare&s;t and deare&s;t of all human relations; as involving in it the hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery of all your days; and as engaging you in a variety of cares and duties, hitherto unknown. Act, therefore, with delib|eration, and re&s;olve with caution: but, when once you have come to a choice, behave with undeviating rectitude and &s;incerity.</P>
<P>"Avarice is not commonly a ruling pa&s;&s;ion in young per&s;ons of <HI>our</HI> &s;ex. Yet &s;ome there are, &s;ordid enough to con&s;ider wealth as the chief good, and to &s;acrifice every other object to a &s;plendid appearance.

<P>"In this momentous affair, let the advice and opinion of judicious friends have their ju&s;t weight in your minds.

The tender themes, in&s;pired by love, may be plea&s;ing to you; but, to an uninter|e&s;ted per&s;on, mu&s;t he in&s;ipid and di&s;gu&s;ting, in the extreme.</P>

<HEAD>Saturday, P. M. RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>"HAVING given you my &s;entiments on a variety of &s;ubjects which demand your partic|ular attention, I come now to the clo&s;ing and mo&s;t important theme; and that is Religion. The virtuous education which you have received, and the good principles which have been in&s;tilled into your minds from infancy, will render the enforcement of Chri&s;tian precepts and duties a plea&s;ing le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>"Religion is to be con&s;idered as an e&s;&s;ential and durable object; not as the embelli&s;hment of a day; but an acqui&s;ition which &s;hall endure and increa&s;e through the endle&s;s ages of eternity.</P>
<P>"Lay the foundation of it in youth, and it will not for&s;ake you in advanced age; but fur|ni&s;h you with an adequate &s;ub&s;titute for the tran|&s;ient plea&s;ures which will then de&s;ert you; and prove a &s;ource of rational and refined delight; a refuge from the di&s;appointments and corroding cares of life, and from the depre&s;&s;ions of adver&s;e events. "Remember now your Creator, in the days of your youth, while the evil days come not,
<PB N="108" REF="033748_0106_0FF92B79E560C960">
nor the years draw nigh, when you &s;hall &s;ay, we have no plea&s;ure in them." If you wi&s;h for permanent happine&s;s, cultivate the divine favour as your highe&s;t enjoyment in life, and your &s;afe&s;t retreat when death &s;hall approach you.</P>
<P>"That even the young are not exempt from the arre&s;t of this univer&s;al conqueror, the tomb|&s;tone of Amelia will tell you. Youth, beauty, health and fortune, &s;trewed the path of life with flowers, and left her no wi&s;h ungratified. Love, with its gentle&s;t and pure&s;t flame, animated her heart, and was equally returned by Julius. Their pa&s;&s;ion was approved by their parents and friends; the day was fixed, and preparations were making for the celebration of their nup|tials. At this period, Amelia was attacked by a violent cold, which, &s;eating on her lungs, baffled the &s;kill of the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians, and ter|minated in a confirmed hectic. She perceived her di&s;order to be incurable, and with inexpre&s;|&s;ible regret and concern anticipated her approach|ing di&s;&s;olution. She had enjoyed life too highly to think much of death; yet die &s;he mu&s;t! "Oh," &s;aid &s;he, "that I had prepared, while in health and at ea&s;e, for this awful event! Then &s;hould I not be &s;ubjected to the keene&s;t di&s;tre&s;s of mind, in addition to the mo&s;t painful infirmities of body! Then &s;hould I be able to look forward with hope, and to find relief in the con&s;oling ex|pectation of being united, beyond the grave,

with tho&s;e dear and beloved connexions, which I mu&s;t &s;oon leave behind! Let my companions and acquaintance learn from me the important le&s;&s;on of improving their time to the be&s;t of purpo&s;es; of acting at once as becomes mortal and immortal creatures!"</P>
<P>"Hear, my dear pupils, the &s;olemn admoni|tion, and be ye al&s;o ready!</P>
<P>"Too many, e&s;pecially of the young and gay, &s;eem more anxious to live in plea&s;ure, than to an&s;wer the end of their being by the cultivation of that piety and virtue which will render them good members of &s;ociety, u&s;eful to their friends and a&s;&s;ociates, and partakers of that heart-felt &s;atisfaction which re&s;ults from a con&s;cience void of offence both towards God and man.</P>
<P>"This, however, is an egregious mi&s;take; for in many &s;ituations, piety nd virtue are our only &s;ource of con&s;olation; and in all, they are pecu|liarly friendly to our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>"Do you exult in beauty, and the pride of external charms? Turn your eyes, for a moment, on the mi&s;erable Flirtilla.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 52.</NOTE> Like her, your fea|tures and complexion may be impaired by di&s;|ea&s;e: and where then will you find a refuge from mortification and di&s;content, if de&s;titute of tho&s;e ennobling endowments which can rai&s;e you &s;uperior to the tran&s;ient graces of a fair form; if unadorned by that &s;ub&s;tantial beauty of mind
<PB N="110" REF="033748_0108_0FF92B960FDD3010">
which can not only en&s;ure re&s;pect from tho&s;e around you, but in&s;pire you with re&s;ignation to the divine will, and a patient acquie&s;cence in the mo&s;t painful allotments of a holy Providence? Does wealth await your command, and gran|deur with its fa&s;cinating appendages beguile your fleeting moments? Recollect, that riches often make them&s;elves wings and fly away. A &s;ingle in&s;tance of mi&s;management; a con&s;uming fire, with various other misfortunes which no human prudence can fore&s;ee or prevent, may &s;trip you of this dependence; and, unle&s;s you have other grounds of comfort than earth can boa&s;t, reduce you to the mo&s;t in&s;upportable wretchedne&s;s and de&s;pair. Are you &s;urrounded by friends, and happy in the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who are near and dear to you? Soon may they be wre&s;ted from your fond embrace, and con&s;igned to the man|&s;ions of the dead!</P>
<P>"Whence, then, will you derive &s;upport, if unacquainted with that divine Friend, who will never fail nor for&s;ake you; who is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever?</P>
<P>"Health and youth, my dear girls, are the &s;ea&s;ons for improvement. Now you may lay up a trea&s;ure which neither &s;ickne&s;s nor adver&s;ity can impair.</P>
<P>"But the hour of di&s;tre&s;s is not the only time, in which religion will be advantageous to you. Even in pro&s;perity, it will prove the be&s;t &s;olace,
<PB N="111" REF="033748_0109_0FF92B9B35C80930">
and the highe&s;t ornament of your lives. What can be more dignified, re&s;pectable, and lovely, than the Chri&s;tian character? The habitual practice of tho&s;e duties which the go&s;pel incul|cates will give lu&s;tre to your beauty and durabil|ity to your charms. By correcting your pa&s;|&s;ions, it will improve your joys, endear you to your friends and connexions, and render you contented, happy, and u&s;eful in every &s;tage and condition of life.</P>
<P>Religion will not deprive you of temporal en|joyments; it will heighten and increa&s;e them. It will not depre&s;s, but exhilarate your &s;pirits. For it con&s;i&s;ts not in a gloomy, mi&s;anthropic temper, declining the &s;ocial and innocent de|lights of life; but prepares the mind to partake with &s;atisfaction of every plea&s;ure which rea&s;on approves, and which can yield &s;erenity and peace in the review. Be not a&s;hamed then of ap|pearing religious, and of ri&s;ing by that mean above the vain, unthinking crowd.</P>
<P>"Let not the idle je&s;ts of heedle&s;s and un|principled companions deter you from a &s;tedfa&s;t adherence to the path of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. "Follow not the multitude to do evil." Never conform to fa&s;hion, even though it claim the patronage of politene&s;s, &s;o far as to countenance irreligion in any of its modifications.</P>
<P>"Je&s;ting upon &s;acred &s;ubjects, ridiculing the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, light and irreverent
<PB N="112" REF="033748_0110_0FF92B9E6F915A58">
conduct upon &s;olemn occa&s;ions, ought to be cau|tiou&s;ly avoided and decidedly condemned. Too many girls are &s;o extremely thoughtle&s;s as to carry the levity of their manners even to the &s;anctuary; and by whi&s;pering, winking, titter|ing, and other indecent actions, di&s;play their fol|ly to their own di&s;grace, and to the great di&s;|gu&s;t of all judicious and &s;ober people. Such behaviour is not only offen&s;ive to the Deity, but in&s;ulting to all who would wor&s;hip him free from interruption. It is not only an indignity offered to religion, but a flagrant breach of the rules of good breeding. Content not your&s;elves, therefore, with a bare attendance on the in&s;titutions of re|ligion; but conduct with propriety, decorum, and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, while engaged in the &s;olemn &s;er|vice. Bear in mind, that you a&s;&s;emble with a profe&s;&s;ed purpo&s;e of paying homage to the Su|preme; and con&s;ider your&s;elves as in his imme|diate pre&s;ence!</P>
<P>"The offices of devotion demand your atten|tion in private, as well as in public.</P>
<P>"Accu&s;tom your&s;elves, therefore, to &s;tated periods of retirement for meditation and prayer; and adopt every other mean which is calcula|ted to keep alive in your minds a due &s;en&s;e of your dependence and obligations, and to in|&s;pire you with that uniform love to God and benevolence to the human kind, which will prove your greate&s;t glory here, as well as your crown of rejoicing hereafter."</P>

<SALUTE>RESPECTED AND DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CONFORMABLY to my promi&s;e, when I left your abode, the fir&s;t efforts of my pen are dedicated to you. The plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from the recollection of your more than mater|nal kindne&s;s to me, e&s;pecially your unwearied en|deavours to refine and embelli&s;h my mind, and to lay the foundation of right principles and prac|tices, is interwoven with my exi&s;tence; and no time or circum&s;tances can era&s;e my gratitude.</P>
<P>I arrived la&s;t evening &s;afely; and was affec|tionately received by my honored parents, and beloved brothers and &s;i&s;ters. The emotions of regret which I felt in the morning, at the painful &s;eparation from you and my dear &s;chool-mates, with whom I have lived &s;o happily, had not whol|ly &s;ub&s;ided. I could not help li&s;tening, now and then, for &s;ome judicious ob&s;ervation from my Preceptre&s;s; and frequently ca&s;t my eyes around
<PB N="115" REF="033748_0113_0FF92BB783193680">
in &s;earch of &s;ome of the amiable companions, among whom I had been u&s;ed to unbend every thought.</P>
<P>The &s;plendor of the apartments gave me ideas of re&s;traint that were painful; and I looked abroad for the green, where we were wont to gambol, and the lawn where we &s;o often held our twilight &s;ports, and almo&s;t fancied that we &s;ome|times caught a glimp&s;e of the attendant Sylphs who played around us; but in vain. Stately domes, crowded &s;treets, rattling carriages, and all the noi&s;e and confu&s;ion of a commercial city were &s;ub&s;tituted. I retired to bed, and was awaked in the night by the riotous mirth of a number of Bachanalians, reeling from the haunts of intemperance and exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;aid I, this is not the Aeolian harp that u&s;ed to &s;oothe our &s;lumbers at the boarding &s;chool. I compo&s;ed my&s;elf again; but awoke at the ac|cu&s;tomed hour of five. I aro&s;e; and, having prai&s;ed my Maker for the pre&s;ervations of the night, walked down. Not a living creature was &s;tirring in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I took a turn in the garden. Here art &s;eemed to reign &s;o perfectly mi&s;tre&s;s, that I was appre|hen&s;ive le&s;t I &s;hould injure her charms by view|ing them.</P>
<P>I accordingly retired to the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, and, having a book in my hand, &s;at down and read till the clock &s;truck &s;even. I then thought it
<PB N="116" REF="033748_0114_0FF8C6F92B6183B8">
mu&s;t be breakfa&s;t time, and returned to the hou&s;e; but was much di&s;appointed to find none of the family up, except one man-&s;ervant and the hou&s;e-maid, who had ju&s;t crept down.</P>
<P>They appeared perfectly a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee me come in from abroad; and the girl re&s;pectfully inquired if indi&s;po&s;ition had occa&s;ioned my ri|&s;ing &s;o early. I told her no; that the wi&s;h to pre&s;erve my health had called me up two hours before. Well, rejoined &s;he, you will not find any body to keep you company here, for two hours to come. I was chagrined at the information, and a&s;ked her for a bowl of milk, it being pa&s;t my u&s;ual breakfa&s;t time. The milk man had ju&s;t arrived, and I drank &s;ome; but it had lo&s;t its flavour on the road. It was not like that which was &s;erved us at Harmony-Grove. I &s;tepped to the harp&s;ichord, and having &s;ung and played a morning hymn, returned to my chamber, where, taking my work, I &s;at down by the window to view the li&s;tle&s;s tribe of yawning mortals who were beginning to thicken in the &s;treets. One half of the&s;e appeared to be dragged forth by ne|ce&s;&s;ity, rather than any inclination to enjoy the beauties of a fine morning.</P>
<P>At nine, I was &s;ummoned into the parlour to breakfa&s;t. My &s;i&s;ters gently chid me for di&s;turb|ing their repo&s;e with my mu&s;ic. I excu&s;ed my|&s;elf by alleging that I had been &s;o long accu&s;|tomed

<SALUTE>DEAR MATILDA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not intend, when we parted at the boarding &s;chool, that a whole month &s;hould have elap&s;ed without bearing you &s;ome te&s;timony of my continued friend&s;hip and affection; but &s;o numerous have been my avocations, and &s;o va|rious my engagements, that I have &s;carcely call|ed a moment my own &s;ince&punc; I returned home. Having been from town a year, I was con&s;idered as too antique to appear in company abroad, till I had been perfectly metamorpho&s;ed. Every part of my habit has undergone a complete change, in conformity to the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion. It was with extreme regret that I parted with the neatne&s;s and &s;implicity of my country dre&s;s; which, ac|cording to my ideas of mode&s;ty, was more be|coming. But, I tru&s;t, this alteration of appear|ance will have no tendency to alienate tho&s;e &s;entiments from my heart, which I imbibed under the tuition of Mrs. Williams.</P>
<P>I went, la&s;t evening, to the a&s;&s;embly; but though dazzled, I was by no means charmed, by the glare of finery and tin&s;elled decorations that were di&s;played.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome ladies, who&s;e gentility and fa&s;hionable dre&s;s were evidently the product of
<PB N="119" REF="033748_0117_0FF92B88EB174FA0">
a correct ta&s;te; but others were &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed by tawdry gewgaws, as to di&s;gu&s;t me exceedingly.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the dre&s;s was indicative of the mind. If this ob&s;ervation be ju&s;t, what opinion am I to form of the gay mul|titudes who trip along the &s;treets, and throng the places of public re&s;ort in this metropolis; the lightne&s;s and gaudine&s;s of who&s;e appearance, be&s;peak a &s;ickly ta&s;te, to &s;ay no more!</P>
<P>I am furni&s;hed with feathers, flowers, and ribbons, in profu&s;ion. I &s;hall, however, u&s;e them very &s;paringly; and though I would not be entirely &s;ingular, yet I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> in&s;i&s;t on con&s;ult|ing my own fancy a little, and cannot willingly &s;acrifice my own opinion to the capricious whims of fa&s;hion, and her devotees. My aunt Laurence, who, you know, is extravagantly genteel, is making us a vi&s;it. She laughs very heartily at my &s;illy notions, as &s;he calls them, and &s;tyles me a novice in the ways of the world; but hopes, notwith&s;tanding, that I &s;hall acquire a better ta&s;te, when I am more acquainted with fa&s;hion|able life. That I may be much improved by a more exten&s;ive knowledge of the world, I doubt not; yet may I never be corrupted by that levity and folly, which are too prevalent among a part of my &s;ex.</P>
<P>I will not, however, cen&s;ure and condemn others; but attend to my&s;elf and be humble. Adieu.</P>

<P>YOU have left&mdash;you have for&s;aken me, Caroline! But I will haunt you with my let|ters; obtrude my&s;elf upon your remembrance; and extort from you the continuance of your friend&s;hip!</P>
<P>What do I &s;ay? Obtrude and extort! Can the&s;e har&s;h words be u&s;ed when I am addre&s;&s;ing the generous and faithful Caroline?</P>
<P>But you have often encouraged my eccentri|cities by your &s;mile, and mu&s;t therefore &s;till in|dulge them.</P>
<P>Nature has furni&s;hed me with a gay di&s;po&s;i|tion; and happy is it for me, that a lax educa|tion has not &s;trengthened the folly too commonly ari&s;ing from it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams's in&s;tructions were very &s;ea&s;on|ably interpo&s;ed to impre&s;s my mind with a &s;en&s;e of virtue and propriety. I tru&s;t they have had the de&s;ired effect; and that they will prove the guardian of my youth, and the directory of ma|turer age. How often has the dear, good wo|man taken me into her chamber, and reminded me of indecorums of which I was uncon&s;cious at the time; but thankful afterwards that they had not e&s;caped her judicious eye; as her ob&s;er|vations tended to rectify my errors, and render

me more cautious and circum&s;pect in future. How &s;alutary is advice like her's; conveyed, not with the dogmatic air of &s;upercilious wi&s;dom; but with the conde&s;cending ea&s;e and &s;oothing kindne&s;s of an affectionate parent, anxiou&s;ly concerned for the be&s;t good of tho&s;e under her care!</P>
<P>I was very happy at Harmony-Grove; and the re&s;ult of that happine&s;s, I hope, will accom|pany me through life.</P>
<P>Yet I find the gaiety of the town adapted to my ta&s;te; nor does even Mrs. Williams condemn the enjoyment of its plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>I was, la&s;t evening, at a ball; and I a&s;&s;ure you, the attention I gained, and the gallantry di&s;played to attract my notice and approbation, were very flattering to my vanity; though I could not forbear inwardly &s;miling at the futile arts of the pretty fellows who exhibited them.</P>
<P>Their &s;peeches appeared to have been &s;o long practi&s;ed, that I was on the point of advi&s;ing them to exerci&s;e their genius, if they had any, in the invention of &s;omething new. But a po|lite conformity to the <HI>ton</HI> re&s;trained my &s;atire. Adieu.</P>

<P>I AM di&s;appointed and di&s;plea&s;ed, Cleora! I have long been anxious to procure the Mar|chione&s;s de Sevign&egrave;'s letters, having often heard them mentioned as &s;tandards of ta&s;te and ele|gance in the epi&s;tolary way. This excited my curio&s;ity, and rai&s;ed my hopes of finding a rich entertainment of wit and &s;entiment. I have peru&s;ed, and peru&s;ed in vain; for they an&s;wer not my ideas of either. They are replete with local circum&s;tances, which, to indifferent read|ers, are neither amu&s;ing nor intere&s;ting. True, the &s;tyle is ea&s;y and &s;prightly; but they are chiefly compo&s;ed of family matters, &s;uch as re|late to her own movements and tho&s;e of her daughter; many of which are of too trifling a nature to be ranked in the cla&s;s of elegant wri|ting. I own my&s;elf, however, not a competent judge of their merit as a whole, even in my own e&s;timation; for I have read the two fir&s;t vol|umes only.</P>
<P>That letters ought to be written with the fa|miliarity of per&s;onal conver&s;ation, I allow; yet many &s;uch conver&s;ations, even between per&s;ons of ta&s;te and refinement, are unworthy the public attention.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="033748_0124_0FF92C1A2D141D88">Equal was my chagrin, not long &s;ince, on reading Pope's letters. He, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, who bears the palm from all contemporary po|ets, and who is &s;o con&s;ummate a ma&s;ter of this divine art, mu&s;t &s;urely furni&s;h a &s;ource of &s;upe|rior entertainment, when he de&s;cends to friend|ly and &s;ocial communications.</P>
<P>Indeed, there are good &s;entiments and judi|cious ob&s;ervations, inter&s;per&s;ed in his letters; but the greater part of them have little other merit than what ari&s;es from the &s;tyle.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will charge me with arrogance, for pre&s;uming to critici&s;e, much more to con|demn, publications which have &s;o long been &s;anc|tioned by general approbation. Independent in opinion, I write it without re&s;erve, and cen&s;ure not any one who thinks differently.

<SALUTE>DEAR CAROLINE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your's with tho&s;e lively &s;en&s;a|tions of plea&s;ure which your favours always afford. As I was peru&s;ing it, my papa came into the room. He took it out of my hand, and read it; then returning it with the &s;mile of approbation; I think, &s;aid he, that your corre&s;pondent has played the critic very well. Has &s;he played it ju&s;t|ly, Sir? &s;aid I. Why, it is a long time, &s;aid he, &s;ince I read the Marchione&s;s de Sevigne's letters. I am not, therefore, a judge of their merit. But, with regard to Pope, I blame not the &s;ex for retaliating upon him; for he always treated them &s;atirically. I believe revenge was no part of my friend's plan, &s;aid I. She is far &s;uperior to &s;o malignant a pa&s;&s;ion; though, were &s;he capa|ble of &s;eeking it, it would be in behalf of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>Company now coming in, the conver&s;ation &s;hifted.</P>
<P>I have often &s;miled at the pitiful wit of tho&s;e &s;atiri&s;ts and e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts, who lavi&s;h abundant elo|quence on trifling foibles, the mere whims of a day; and of no con&s;equence to the body natu|ral, moral, or political. The exten&s;ion of a hoop, the contraction of the wai&s;t, or the eleva|tion of the head-dre&s;s, frequently afford matter
<PB N="128" REF="033748_0126_0FF92C2A0FAE8AA8">
for pages of elaborate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The&s;e reform|ers, too, always aim at the good of our &s;ex! I think it a great pity they do not lop off &s;ome of their own exuberant follies; though, perhaps, they wi&s;h us to exchange labours; and, in re|turn for their benevolent exertions, that we en|deavour to expo&s;e and correct their errors. I have &s;ometimes thought their &s;atire to be tinc|tured with malice; and that the cau&s;e of their di&s;affection may generally be found in per&s;onal re&s;entment. Had Pope and his coadjutors been favourites with the ladies, I doubt not but they would have found more excellencies in them than they have ever yet allowed.</P>
<P>I have lately been reading the generous and polite Fitzo&s;borne's letters; and I need not tell you how much I was plea&s;ed and charmed with them.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tne&s;s of his &s;entiments, and the ea&s;e and elegance of his diction are at once intere&s;t|ing and improving. His letter and ode to his wife on the anniver&s;ary of their marriage, &s;ur|pa&s;s any thing of the kind I have ever read. I verily think, that, had I the offer of a heart capable of dictating &s;uch manly tenderne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;uch pathetic energy of generous love, I &s;hould be willing to give my hand in re|turn, and a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e &s;olemn words, "love, honor, and&mdash;(I had almo&s;t &s;aid) obey."

<P>I AGREE with you, that the habits of the weak and vain are too in&s;ignificant to employ the pens of tho&s;e, who&s;e literary talents might produce great and good effects in the political, moral, and religious &s;tate of things. Were ab|surd fa&s;hions adopted only by tho&s;e who&s;e friv|olity renders them the dupes of folly, and who&s;e example can have no effect on the con&s;iderate and judicious part of the community, I &s;hould think them below the attention of &s;tate&s;men, philo&s;ophers, and divines: but this is not the ca&s;e. The votaries and the inventors of the mo&s;t fanta&s;tical fa&s;hions are found in the ranks of, what is called, refined and poli&s;hed &s;ociety; from whom we might hope for examples of ele|gance and propriety, both in dre&s;s and behaviour.

<SALUTE>DEAR CLEORA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this week engaged in the celebra|tion of the nuptials of my friend, Amanda South. A &s;plendid wedding, a gay company, an elegant &s;upper, and a magnificent ball, were the &s;um of our entertainment.</P>
<P>I imagine &s;uch exhilarating &s;cenes de&s;igned to di&s;pel the anxiety and thoughtfulne&s;s, which ev|ery reflecting per&s;on mu&s;t feel on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. This untried &s;tate pre&s;ents to the ap|prehen&s;ive mind &s;uch a variety of new cares and duties, that cheerfulne&s;s, fe&s;tivity, and hilarity &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to bani&s;h the thought of them, &s;o far as to render a delicate and &s;en&s;ible female &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to conduct with propriety. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, were I called to the trial, I &s;hould choo&s;e to retire from the ob&s;erva|tion of tho&s;e indifferent and unfeeling &s;pectators, to whom the blu&s;hing mode&s;ty of a bride is often a pa&s;time.</P>
<P>Indeed, Cleora, when we look around the world and ob&s;erve the great number of unhappy marriages, which were contracted with the bright|e&s;t pro&s;pects, yet, from &s;ome unfore&s;een cau&s;e, have involved the parties in wretchedne&s;s for life, we may well indulge a diffidence of our own

abilities to di&s;charge the duties of the &s;tation, and be &s;olicitous that our future companion &s;hould in all re&s;pects be qualified to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bearing the burdens of the conjugal &s;tate.</P>
<P>Experience only can determine how far we are right in the judgment we form of our&s;elves, and of the per&s;on of our choice. So many are the deceptions which love and court&s;hip impo&s;e upon their votaries, that I believe it very difficult for the parties concerned to judge impartially, or to di&s;cern faults, where they look only for virtues. Hence they are &s;o frequently mi&s;led in their opin|ions, and find, too late, the errors into which they have been betrayed.</P>
<P>When do you come to Bo&s;ton, Cleora? I am impatient for your &s;ociety; becau&s;e your friend|&s;hip is void of flattery, and your &s;incerity and cheerfulne&s;s are always agreeable and advan|tageous. Adieu.</P>

<P>INDEED, Harriot, I open your letters with as much gravity as I would a &s;ermon; you have &s;uch a knack of moralizing upon every event!

<P>However, I mu&s;t acknowledge it a weighty af|fair; and what you &s;ay has, perhaps, too much truth in it to be je&s;ted with. I believe, there|fore, we had better re&s;olve not to ri&s;k the con&s;e|quences of a wrong choice, or imprudent con|duct; but wi&s;ely devote our&s;elves to celibacy. I am &s;ure we &s;hould make a couple of very clev|er old maids. If you agree to this propo&s;ition, we will begin in &s;ea&s;on to accu&s;tom our&s;elves to the virtues and habits of a &s;ingle life. By ob|&s;erving what is ami&s;s in the conduct of others in the &s;ame &s;tate, and avoiding their errors, I doubt not but we may bring even the title into repute. In this way we &s;hall be u&s;eful to many of our own &s;ex, though I am aware it would be a mo&s;t grievous di&s;pen&s;ation to a couple of the other; but no matter for that.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="033748_0135_0FF92C820D7DDF68">The world needs &s;ome &s;uch examples as we might become; and if we can be in&s;trumental of retrieving <HI>old-maidi&s;m</HI> from the imputation of ill-nature, oddity, and many other mortifying charges, which are now brought again&s;t it, I believe we &s;hall &s;ave many a good girl from an unequal and unhappy marriage. It might have a &s;alutary effect on the other &s;ex too. Finding the ladies independent in &s;entiment, they would be impelled to greater circum&s;pection of conduct to merit their favour.</P>
<P>You &s;ee that my benevolence is exten&s;ive. I wi&s;h to become a general reformer. What &s;ay you to my plan, Harriot? If you approve it, di&s;mi&s;s your long train of admirers immediately, and act not the part of a coquette, by retaining them out of pride or vanity. We mu&s;t ri&s;e above &s;uch narrow views, and let the world know that we act from principle, if we mean to do good by our example. I &s;hall continue to receive the addre&s;&s;es of this &s;ame Junius, till I hear that you have acceded to my propo&s;al; and then, di&s;play my fortitude by renouncing a connexion which mu&s;t be doubtful as to the i&s;&s;ue, and will certainly expo&s;e me to the morti|fication of being looked at, when I am married.

<SALUTE>DEAR SISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM not &s;o far engaged by the new &s;cenes of fa&s;hionable gaiety which &s;urround me, as to forget you and the other dear friends, whom I left at Harmony-Grove. Yet &s;o great is the novelty which I find in this crowded metropolis, that you cannot wonder if my attention is very much engro&s;&s;ed. Mr. and Mrs. Henly, with their amiable daughters, are extremely polite and attentive to me; and have taken every method to contribute to my amu&s;ement. I went, ye&s;ter|day, in their company, to Commencement at Cambridge; and was very much entertained with the exhibition. I pretend not to be a judge of the talents di&s;played by the young gentlemen who took an active part; or of the proficiency they had made in &s;cience. I have an opinion of my own, notwith&s;tanding; and can tell how far my eye and ear were gratified.</P>
<P>I never knew before that dre&s;s was a cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudy; which I now conclude it mu&s;t be, or it would not have exerci&s;ed the genius of &s;ome of the principal &s;peakers on this public occa&s;ion!</P>
<P>The female garb too, &s;eemed to claim particu|lar attention. The <HI>bon ton,</HI> ta&s;te, and fa&s;hions of our &s;ex, afforded a &s;ubject of declamation to the
<PB N="143" REF="033748_0141_0FF92CD7D79D7C88">
orator; and of entertainment to the audience, compo&s;ed, in part, of our legi&s;lators, politicians, and divines! I could not but think that tho&s;e &s;cholars who employ their time in &s;tudying, in|ve&s;tigating, and critici&s;ing the ladies' dre&s;&s;es, might as well be occupied in the bu&s;ine&s;s of a frizeur or the man-millener; either of which would af|ford them more frequent opportunities for the di&s;play of their abilities, and render their labours more exten&s;ively u&s;eful to the &s;ex. Others might then improve the time, which <HI>they</HI> thus frivolou&s;ly engro&s;&s;ed on this anniver&s;ary, in contributing to the entertainment of the <HI>literati,</HI> who doubtle&s;s expect to be gratified by the exertions of genius, and an apparent progre&s;s in tho&s;e &s;tudies, which are de&s;igned to qualify the ri&s;ing youth of Amer|ica for important &s;tations both in church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly was extremely brilliant; the la|dies &s;eemed to vie with each other in magnificent decorations. So much loveline&s;s was vi&s;ible in their native charms, that, without any hint from the &s;peakers of the day, I &s;hould have thought it a pity to add tho&s;e foreign ornaments, which rather ob&s;cure than aid them.</P>
<P>I was a little di&s;plea&s;ed by the unbecoming levity of &s;ome of my &s;ex; and apprehen&s;ive le&s;t it might induce misjudging and cen&s;orious people to imagine that they were led thither more by
<PB N="144" REF="033748_0142_0FF8C787A28785F8">
the vanity of attracting notice, than to receive any mental entertainment.</P>
<P>Without our con&s;ent, we ran a race back to town, which endangered our necks. The avari|cious hackman, de&s;irous of returning for another freight, had no mercy on his pa&s;&s;engers or hor&s;es. However, we arrived &s;afely, though much fa|tigued by the plea&s;ure of the day.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure carried to exce&s;s degenerates into pain. This I actually experienced; and &s;ighed for the tranquil enjoyments of Harmony-Grove, to which I propo&s;e &s;oon to return, and convince you how affectionately I am your's.</P>

<P>YOUR enlivening letter re&s;tored us, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to your &s;ociety; or at lea&s;t allevi|ated the pain of your ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>I am glad you attended Commencement. It was a new &s;cene, and con&s;equently extended your ideas. I think you rather &s;evere on the cla&s;&s;ical gentlemen. We &s;imple country-folks mu&s;t not pre&s;ume to arraign <HI>their</HI> ta&s;te, who&s;e learning and abilities render them con&s;picuous on the literary &s;tage. They, doubtle&s;s, write on &s;ubjects be&s;t adapted to their capacities. As for the follies of fa&s;hion, I think the gentlemen are under obligations to the ladies for adopting them; &s;ince it gives exerci&s;e to their genius and pens.</P>
<P>You were tired, you &s;ay, with plea&s;ure. I be|lieve tho&s;e di&s;&s;ipating &s;cenes, which greatly exhil|arate the &s;pirits, call for the whole attention, and oblige us to exert every power, are always fa|tiguing.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ures of a calmer kind, which are moder|ately enjoyed, which enliven rather than exhau&s;t, and which yield a &s;erenity of mind on reflection, are the mo&s;t durable, rational, and &s;atisfying. Plea&s;ure is the mo&s;t alluring object which is pre|&s;ented to the view of the young and inexperi|enced.

Under various forms it courts our atten|tion; but, while we are &s;till eager in the pur&s;uit, it eludes our gra&s;p. Its fa&s;cinating charms de|ceive the imagination, and create a bower of bli&s;s in every di&s;tant object. But let us be careful not to fix our affections on any thing which bears this name, unle&s;s it be founded on virtue, and will endure the &s;evere&s;t &s;crutiny of examination.</P>
<P>Our honored mamma, and all your friends here, are impatient for your return. They uni|tedly long to embrace, and bid you welcome to the&s;e &s;eats of &s;implicity and ea&s;e: but none more ardently, than your affectionate &s;i&s;ter,</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR MATILDA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ANXIOUS to make the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible u&s;e of the education I have received; and fully im|pre&s;&s;ed with the idea, that the human mind is capable of continual improvements, it is my con|&s;tant endeavour to extract honey from every flower which falls in my way, or, to &s;peak with|out a figure, to derive advantage from every in|cident. Pur&s;uant to the advice of our excellent Preceptre&s;s, I keep this perpetually in view; and am therefore di&s;appointed when defeated in the attempt.</P>
<P>This afternoon I have been in company with three ladies, celebrated for their beauty and wit. One of them, I think, may ju&s;tly claim the rep|utation of beauty. To a fini&s;hed form, a fair complexion, and an engaging, animating coun|tenance are added. Yet a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;u|perior charms was apparent in her deportment; and a &s;upercilious air counteracted the effects of her per&s;onal accompli&s;hments. The two others were evidently more indebted to art than to na|ture for their appearance. It might ea&s;ily be di&s;covered that paint con&s;tituted all the delicacy of their complexion!</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="033748_0146_0FF92D0192DB4928">What a pity, that &s;o many are deceived in their ideas of beauty! Certain it is, that artificial ad|ditions &s;erve rather to impair than increa&s;e its power. "Who can paint like nature?" What hand is &s;kilful enough to &s;upply her defects? Do not tho&s;e who attempt it always fail, and render them&s;elves di&s;gu&s;ting? Do they not really injure what they &s;trive to mend; and make it more indifferent than u&s;ual, when dive&s;ted of its temporary embelli&s;hments? Beauty cannot po&s;&s;i|bly maintain its &s;way over its mo&s;t ob&s;equious votaries, unle&s;s the manners and the mind uni|tedly contribute to &s;ecure it. How vain then is this &s;ubterfuge! It may deceive the eye, and gain the flattery of the prattling coxcomb; but accumulated neglect and mortification inevitably await tho&s;e who tru&s;t in the wretched alter|native.</P>
<P>From their good &s;en&s;e, I had been led to expect the greate&s;t entertainment. I therefore waited impatiently till the fir&s;t compliments were over, and conver&s;ation commenced.</P>
<P>But, to my extreme regret, I found it to con|&s;i&s;t of ludicrous in&s;inuations, hackneyed je&s;ts, and &s;atirical remarks upon others of their acquaint|ance who were ab&s;ent. The pretty fellows of the town were critici&s;ed; and their own adven|tures in &s;hopping were related with &s;o much mi|nutene&s;s, hilarity, and glee, that I blu&s;hed for the frivolous levity of tho&s;e of my &s;ex, who could
<PB N="149" REF="033748_0147_0FF92D09F42190D8">
&s;ub&s;titute buffoonery for wit, and the effu&s;ions of a perverted imagination for that refined and im|proving conver&s;ation, which a well cultivated mind and a correct ta&s;te are calculated to af|ford!</P>
<P>If, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, this be the beauty and the wit of poli&s;hed &s;ociety, re&s;tore me again to the native &s;implicity and &s;incerity of Harmony-Grove!</P>
<P>I took my leave as &s;oon as politene&s;s would allow; and left them to animadvert upon me. Independent for happine&s;s on the prai&s;e or cen|&s;ure of &s;uperficial minds, let me ever be con&s;cious of meriting approbation, and I &s;hall re&s;t con|tented in the certain pro&s;pect of receiving it.

<P>I SYMPATHIZE with you, my dear Sophia, in the di&s;appointment you received in your expectations from beauty and wit.</P>
<P>You may neverthele&s;s derive advantage from it. Your refined and delicate ideas rai&s;e you too far above the &s;cenes of common life. They paint the defects of your inferiors in &s;uch lively colours, that the greater part of the community mu&s;t be di&s;plea&s;ing to you. Few, you &s;hould remember, have had the advantages which you have enjoyed; and &s;till fewer have your penetra|ting eye, correct ta&s;te, and quick &s;en&s;ibility. Let charity then draw a veil over the foibles of oth|ers, and candour induce you to look on the be&s;t and brighte&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>It is both our duty and intere&s;t to enjoy life, as far as integrity and innocence allow; and, in order to this, we mu&s;t not &s;oar above, but ac|commodate our&s;elves <HI>to</HI> its ordinary &s;tate. We cannot &s;tem the torrent of folly and vanity; but we can &s;tep a&s;ide and &s;ee it roll on, without &s;uf|fering our&s;elves to be borne down by the &s;tream.</P>
<P>Empty conver&s;ation mu&s;t be di&s;gu&s;ting to ev|ery rational and thinking mind; yet, when it partakes not of malignity, it is harmle&s;s in its ef|fects, as the vapour which floats over the mead in
<PB N="151" REF="033748_0149_0FF92D2F9F5C1F38">
a &s;ummer's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. But, when malice and envy join to give &s;cope to detraction, we ought to avoid their contagion, and decidedly condemn the effu&s;ions of the ill-natured merriment which they in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Our &s;ex have been taxed as defamers. I am convinced, however, that they are not exclu&s;ively guilty; yet, for want of more &s;ub&s;tantial matter of conver&s;ation, I fear they too often give occa|&s;ion for the accu&s;ation! A mind properly culti|vated, and &s;tored with u&s;eful knowledge, will de&s;|pi&s;e a pa&s;time which mu&s;t be &s;upported at the expen&s;e of others. Hence only the &s;uperficial and the giddy are reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of filling the time in which they a&s;&s;ociate together, with the degrading and injurious &s;ubjects of &s;lander. But I tru&s;t that our improved country|women are ri&s;ing far &s;uperior to this nece&s;&s;ity, and are able to convince the world, that the American fair are enlightened, generous, and liberal. The fal&s;e notions of &s;exual di&s;parity, in point of under&s;tanding and capacity, are ju&s;tly exploded; and each branch of &s;ociety is uniting to rai&s;e the virtues and poli&s;h the manners of the whole.</P>

<P>FROM your recommendation of Mrs. Cha|pone's letters; and, what is &s;till more, from the character given them by Mrs. Williams, I was anxious to po&s;&s;e&s;s the book; but, not being able to procure it here, my clerical brother, who was fortunately going to Bo&s;ton, bought and pre&s;ent|ed it to me.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SOPHIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING been with my aunt Burchel for a fortnight pa&s;t, I have indulged my&s;elf in reading novels; with which her library is well &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Richard&s;on's works have occupied a large por|tion of the time. What a &s;urpri&s;ing command has this great ma&s;ter of the pa&s;&s;ions over our feelings! It is happy for his own and &s;ucceed|ing ages, that he embarked in the cau&s;e of virtue. For his influence on the affections of his readers is &s;o great, that it mu&s;t have proved very perni|cious, had he enli&s;ted on the &s;ide of vice. Though am not much of a novel reader, yet his pen has operated like magic on my fancy; and &s;o ex|tremely was I intere&s;ted, that I could have di&s;|pen&s;ed with &s;leep or food for the plea&s;ure I found in reading him.</P>
<P>By this circum&s;tance I am more than ever convinced of the great caution which ought to be u&s;ed in peru&s;ing writings of the kind. How &s;ecretly, and how in&s;idiou&s;ly may they undermine the fabric of virtue, by painting vice and folly in the alluring colours, and with the lively &s;tyle of
<PB N="161" REF="033748_0159_0FF92D9A31AA7A40">
this ingenious author. The mind &s;hould be well informed, and the judgment properly matured, before young people indulge them&s;elves in the unre&s;trained peru&s;al of them.</P>
<P>The examples of virtue and noble qualities, exhibited by the author I have mentioned, are truly u&s;eful; but every writer of novels is not a Richard&s;on: and what dreadful effects might the &s;pecious manners of a Lovelace have on the in|experienced mind, were they not detected by a ju&s;t exhibition of his vices!</P>
<P>The noble conduct of Clementina and Mi&s;s Byron are worthy of imitation; while the indi&s;|cretion of Clari&s;&s;a, in putting her&s;elf under the protection of a libertine, is a warning to every fair. But both examples are often overlooked. While the ear is charmed with the &s;tyle, and the fancy riots on the luxuriance of de&s;cription, which &s;o intimately blend the charms of virtue and the fa&s;cinations of vice; they are not read|ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by all.</P>
<P>I am not equally plea&s;ed with all Richard&s;on's writings; yet &s;o multifarious are his excellencies, that his faults appear but &s;pecks, which &s;erve as foils to di&s;play his beauties to better ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Before I went from home I was engaged in reading a cour&s;e of hi&s;tory; but I fear I &s;hall
<PB N="162" REF="033748_0160_0FF92D9F1CF64A98">
not return from this flowery field to the dry and le&s;s plea&s;ing path of more laborious &s;tudies. This is one di&s;advantage of novel reading. It di&s;&s;ipates the ideas, relaxes the mind, and renders it inattentive to the more &s;olid and u&s;eful branch|es of literature. Adieu.</P>

<P>INDEED, my dear Harriot, you are making an important change of &s;ituation; a change in|tere&s;ting to you and your friends; a change which involves, not only your own happine&s;s, but the happine&s;s of the worthy man whom you have cho&s;en, of the family, over which you are to pre&s;ide, and perhaps, too, of that with which you are to be connected.</P>
<P>I rejoice to hear that this connexion, on which &s;o much depends, is not ha&s;tily formed; but that it is the re&s;ult of long acquaintance, is founded on merit, and con&s;olidated by e&s;teem. From characters like yours, mutually de&s;erving and excellent, brilliant examples of conjugal vir|tue and felicity may be expected. Yet as hu|man nature is imperfect, liable to errors, and apt to deviate from the line of rectitude and propri|ety, a monitorial guide may be expedient and u&s;eful. Your partiality has led you to reque&s;t this <HI>boon</HI> of me; but diffidence of my own abil|ities compels me to decline the arduous ta&s;k. Neverthele&s;s, I have it happily in my power to recommend an abler in&s;tructor, who has written profe&s;&s;edly upon the &s;ubject. The AMERICAN SPECTATOR, or MATRIMONIAL PRECEPTOR, late|ly publi&s;hed by Mr. David We&s;t, of Bo&s;ton,

contains all you can wi&s;h. The judicious com|piler has collected and arranged his materials with admirable &s;kill and addre&s;s. Peru&s;e this book, and you will be at no lo&s;s for coun&s;els to direct, and cautions to guard you through the intricate cares and duties of the connubial life. The e&s;&s;ays are, chiefly, extracted from the mo&s;t approved Engli&s;h writers. The productions of &s;o many able pens, properly di&s;po&s;ed, and ex|hibited in a new and agreeable light, mu&s;t not only be entertaining, but u&s;eful to every reader of ta&s;te and judgment. I wi&s;h this publication to be con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary piece of furni|ture by every hou&s;ekeeper.

<P>I &s;hall vi&s;it you, my dear Harriot, after the happy knot (for &s;uch I flatter my&s;elf it will prove) is tied. In the mean time, I &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf, with the mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes for your pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, your &s;incere friend,</P>

<P>WHAT think you of wit, Cleora? If you e&s;timate it by the worth of your own, you think it an invaluable jewel. But this jewel is vari|ou&s;ly &s;et. Yours is in the pure &s;terling gold of good &s;en&s;e: yet, as di&s;played by &s;ome, it gli&s;tens on the mere tin&s;el of gaiety, which will not bear the &s;crutinizing eye of judgment.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday I received a vi&s;it from a young lady, lately moved into this neighbourhood, who is re|puted a wit. Her conver&s;ation reminded me of Pope's &s;atirical remark:</P>
<L>"There are, whom Heaven has ble&s;s'd with &s;tore of wit;</L>
<L>But want as much again to manage it."</L>
<P>I found her's to con&s;i&s;t in &s;mart &s;ayings, lively repartees, and ludicrous allu&s;ions.</P>
<P>So &s;trong was her propen&s;ity to di&s;play this talent, that &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t any temptation which offered, though it led her to offend again&s;t the rules of politene&s;s and genero&s;ity. As &s;ome per&s;ons of real genius were pre&s;ent, topics of literature and morality were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Upon the&s;e &s;he was mute as a &s;tatue; but whenever the playfulne&s;s of her fancy could find a &s;ubject, &s;he was extremely loquacious. This induced me to &s;u&s;pect that the brilliance of her imagination
<PB N="168" REF="033748_0166_0FF92E214BFD0010">
had dazzled her under&s;tanding, and rendered her negligent of the more &s;olid and u&s;eful acqui&s;itions of the mind.</P>
<P>Is it not often the ca&s;e, that tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by any &s;uperior endowment, wheth|er per&s;onal or mental, are too much elated by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their pre-eminence, and think it &s;ufficient to counterbalance every deficiency?</P>
<P>This, Mrs. Williams u&s;ed to &s;ay, is owing to the want of &s;elf-knowledge; which, if once po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, will enable us properly to e&s;timate our own characters, and to a&s;certain with preci&s;ion wherein we are defective, as well as wherein we excel. But it is the misfortune of <HI>us,</HI> young people, that we &s;eldom attain this valuable &s;ci|ence, till we have experienced many of the ills which re&s;ult from the want of it. Ambition, vanity, flattery, or &s;ome &s;uch dazzling meteor, engro&s;&s;es our attention, and renders us blind to more important qualifications.</P>
<P>But to return to this &s;ame wit, of which I was &s;peaking. It is certainly a very dangerous talent, when imprudently managed. None that we can po&s;&s;e&s;s tends &s;o directly to excite enmity, or de&s;troy friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>An ill-natured wit is of all characters the mo&s;t univer&s;ally dreaded. People of this de&s;cription are always feared, but rarely loved. Humanity and benevolence are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to ren|der

wit agreeable. Accompanied by the&s;e, it cannot fail to plea&s;e and entertain.</P>
<L>"Wit, how delicious to man's dainty ta&s;te!</L>
<L>'Tis precious as the vehicle of &s;en&s;e;</L>
<L>But as its &s;ub&s;titute, a dire di&s;ea&s;e!</L>
<L>Pernicious talent! flatter'd by mankind,</L>
<L>Yet hated too.&mdash;</L>
<L>Sen&s;e is the diamond, weighty, &s;olid, &s;ound:</L>
<L>When cut by wit, it ca&s;ts a brighter beam;</L>
<L>Yet, wit apart, it is a diamond &s;till.</L>
<L>Wit, widow'd of good &s;en&s;e, is wor&s;e than nought;</L>
<L>It hoi&s;ts more &s;ail to run again&s;t a rock."</L>
<P>But I believe I cannot give a better proof of my own wit, than to conclude this &s;cribble be|fore your patience is quite exhau&s;ted by the pe|ru&s;al. Adieu.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t moment which I have been able to &s;natch from the affectionate embraces of my honored mamma, and my dear &s;i&s;ter Maria, is devoted to you. Judging by the anxious &s;olici|tude of my own heart, I know you are impatient to hear of my &s;afe arrival. It is needle&s;s to tell you how cordially I was received. You have witne&s;&s;ed the mutual tenderne&s;s which actuates our dome&s;tic circle. Where this is the govern|ing principle, it is peculiarly intere&s;ting to &s;en&s;i|bility. It is extremely exhilarating to the mind to revi&s;it, after the &s;horte&s;t ab&s;ence, the place of our nativity and juvenile happine&s;s. "There is &s;omething &s;o &s;educing in that &s;pot, in which we fir&s;t had our exi&s;tence, that nothing but it can plea&s;e. Whatever vici&s;&s;itudes we experience in life, however we toil, or where&s;oever we wan|der, our fatigued wi&s;hes &s;till recur to home for tranquillity. We long to die in that &s;pot which gave us birth, and in that plea&s;ing expectation opiate every calamity."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gold&s;mith.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction of returning home, however, has not obliterated the plea&s;ure which I enjoyed on my vi&s;it to you. Does not a change of &s;cene

and &s;ituation contribute to the happine&s;s of life? The natural love of this variety &s;eems wi&s;ely im|planted in the human brea&s;t; for it enables us to accommodate our&s;elves with facility to the differ|ent circum&s;tances in which we are placed. I be|lieve that no plea&s;ures make &s;o deep an impre&s;|&s;ion on the memory, as tho&s;e of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t innocent period of our lives. With what apparent delight do per&s;ons; advanced in years, re-trace their puerile feats and diver&s;ions! "The hoary head looks back with a &s;mile of complacency, mix|ed with regret, on the &s;ea&s;on when health glowed on the cheek, when lively &s;pirits warmed the heart, and when toil &s;trung the nerves with vigour."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Knox.</NOTE></P>
<P>The plea&s;ures of childhood and youth, when regulated by parental wi&s;dom, and &s;weetened by filial affection and obedience, mu&s;t be grateful to the recollection at any age: and for this plain rea&s;on, becau&s;e innocence and &s;implicity are their leading traits. How &s;oothing, how animating, then, mu&s;t be reflection, at the evening of a life, wholly &s;pent in virtue and rectitude!</P>
<P>Pope ob&s;erves that "Every year is a critique on the la&s;t. The man de&s;pi&s;es the boy, the phi|lo&s;opher the man, and the Chri&s;tian all." Happy are tho&s;e who can take a retro&s;pect of all, with the &s;upporting con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that each part has been rightly performed! Adieu.</P>

Yet, according to the generally received opinion, that variety is nece&s;&s;ary to the enjoy|ment of life, we may find <HI>our's</HI> mutually height|ened by the exchange. Delightful rambles, and hours of contemplative &s;olitude, free from the interruptions of formality and fa&s;hion, I cannot in&s;ure; but you may depend on all that friend|&s;hip and a&s;&s;iduity can &s;ub&s;titute; and while the bleak winds are howling abroad, a cheerful fire-&s;ide, and a &s;ocial circle, may di&s;pel the gloom of the &s;ea&s;on. The plea&s;ures of our family are very local. Few are &s;ought, in which the under&s;tand|ing and affections can have no &s;hare. For this rea&s;on, a &s;elect, not a promi&s;cuous acquaintance is cultivated. And however unfa&s;hionable our practice may be deemed, we can find entertain|ment, even in the dull hours of winter, without recour&s;e to cards. Almo&s;t every other recrea|tion

affords &s;ome exerci&s;e and improvement to the body or mind, or both; but from this nei|ther can re&s;ult. The whole attention is ab&s;orbed by the game. Rea&s;on lies dormant, and the pa&s;|&s;ions only are awake. However little is depend|ing, the parties are frequently as much agitated by hope and fear, as if their all were at &s;take. It is difficult for the vanqui&s;hed not to feel cha|grin; while the victors are gratified at the ex|pen&s;e of their friends. But the principal objection with me, is the utter exclu&s;ion of conver&s;ation; a &s;ource of plea&s;ure, and of profit too, for which I can admit nothing as an equivalent. Winter evenings are peculiarly adapted to this rational and refined entertainment. Deprived of that va|riety of &s;cenery, and tho&s;e beauties of nature, which the vernal and autumnal &s;ea&s;ons exhibit, we are obliged to have recour&s;e to the fire-&s;ide for comfort. Here we have lei&s;ure to collect our &s;cattered ideas, and to improve, by &s;ocial intercour&s;e, and the exertion of our mental powers.</P>
<P>Our &s;ex are often rallied on their volubility: and, for my&s;elf, I frankly confe&s;s, that I am &s;o aver&s;e to taciturnity, and &s;o highly prize the ad|vantages of &s;ociety and friend&s;hip, that I had rather plead guilty to the charge than relin|qui&s;h them.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR LAURA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR's of the 9th ult. has ju&s;t come to hand. It gave me renewed experience of the truth of the ob&s;ervation, that next to the per|&s;onal pre&s;ence and conver&s;ation, is the epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence of a friend. I am preparing, with the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure, to gratify my own wi&s;hes, and comply with your polite invitation. The romantic beauty of the rural &s;cenes has for&s;aken me; and what can &s;o amply compen&s;ate for their ab&s;ence, as the charms you offer?</P>
<P>I envy you nothing which the town affords, but the advantages you derive from the choice of &s;ociety adapted to your own ta&s;te. Your &s;enti|ments of the fa&s;hionable diver&s;ion of card-play|ing, are, in my view, perfectly ju&s;t. I believe that many people join in it, becau&s;e it is the <HI>ton,</HI> rather than from any other motive. And as &s;uch per&s;ons generally pay the greate&s;t deference to Lord Che&s;terfield's opinions and maxims, I have often wondered how they happened to overlook, or di&s;regard his animadver&s;ions upon this &s;ubject; and have felt a &s;trong inclination to tell them, that this <HI>all-accompli&s;hed</HI> ma&s;ter of politene&s;s, and oracle of plea&s;ure, expre&s;sly &s;ay,

"All amu&s;ements, where neither the under|&s;tanding nor the &s;en&s;es can have the lea&s;t &s;hare, I look upon as frivolous, and the re&s;ources of little minds, who either do not think, or do not love to think."</P>
<P>We had a pretty party here, la&s;t evening; and a party it literally was; for it con&s;i&s;ted entirely of ladies. This &s;ingular circum&s;tance was re|marked by one of the company, who, at lea&s;t, pretended to think it agreeable, becau&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, we can now &s;peak without re&s;traint, or the fear of critici&s;m. I confe&s;s that I was not prude enough to acquie&s;ce in her opinion.</P>
<P>Ladies of delicacy and refinement will not countenance or &s;upport a conver&s;ation, which gentlemen of &s;en&s;e and &s;entiment can di&s;approve.

<SALUTE>DEAR CAROLINE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the liberty to &s;end you Bennet's Letters. When my mamma put them into my hand, Sophia, &s;aid &s;he, I recommend this book to your attentive peru&s;al. It highly de&s;erves it, and will richly reward your labour. You have, indeed, completed your &s;chool education; but you have much yet to learn. Improvements in knowledge are nece&s;&s;arily progre&s;&s;ive. The human mind is naturally active and eager in pur&s;uit of information; which we have various and continual means of accumulating: but never will <HI>you</HI> have a more favourable opportunity for the cultivation of your mind, than you now enjoy. You are now free from tho&s;e dome&s;tic cares and avocations, which may hereafter fall to your lot, and occupy mo&s;t of your time. Speculation mu&s;t then give place to practice. Be a&s;&s;iduous, therefore, to increa&s;e the fund, that it may yield you a competent intere&s;t, and afford you a con&s;tant re&s;ource of &s;upport and enjoy|ment.</P>
<P>With the&s;e words &s;he withdrew, while I was &s;till li&s;tening to the &s;weet accents of maternal tenderne&s;s and di&s;cretion, which vibrated on my ear, even after her departure.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="033748_0177_0FF92EE9D0706B78">I find it worthy the recommendation of &s;o good a judge. As a moral writer, the precepts and ob&s;ervations of its author are excellent; as a religious one, his piety is exemplary, and his in&s;tructions improving. His &s;election of books, which he deems mo&s;t proper for our &s;ex, though too numerous, perhaps, may, notwith&s;tanding, a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct the young, in their cour&s;e of reading.</P>
<P>Who would not imitate his Loui&s;a? In her he has forcibly di&s;played the beauties of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition, and the advantages which even <HI>that</HI> may derive from a virtuous and religious education.</P>
<P>The&s;e letters are not &s;chola&s;tic and elaborate di&s;&s;ertations; they are addre&s;&s;ed to the heart; they are the native language of affection: and they can hardly fail to in&s;til the love of virtue into every mind &s;u&s;ceptible of its charms.</P>
<P>If you have not read them, I will venture to predict that they will afford you entertainment, as well as in&s;truction; and if you <HI>have,</HI> they will bear a &s;econd peru&s;al. Indeed, every valuable book &s;hould be re-peru&s;ed. On a fir&s;t reading, our curio&s;ity to know &s;omething of all it contains, hurries us forward with a rapidity which out|&s;trips both the memory and judgment.</P>
<P>When this predominant pa&s;&s;ion is gratified, an attentive review will commonly furni&s;h many
<PB N="180" REF="033748_0178_0FF92F12536E2EA0">
u&s;eful and important le&s;&s;ons, which had nearly or quite e&s;caped our notice before.</P>
<P>This, by &s;ome, is deemed too laborious a ta&s;k. They prefer company and conver&s;ation to read|ing of any kind; and allege, in defence of their opinion, that a knowledge of the world, and of human nature, together with that ea&s;e and grace|fulne&s;s of manners, which are of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to all who would make a re&s;pectable figure in life, are much better obtained in this way, than by the cold and unimpa&s;&s;ioned peru&s;al of books.</P>
<P>But is not every acqui&s;ition of this &s;ort merely &s;uperficial? Need we not a guide, &s;uperior to our own judgment and experience, to point out the line of duty and propriety, in the various conditions and relations of our exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>Our acquaintance with living characters and manners can afford us but a very limited view of mankind, in the different periods and &s;tages of &s;ociety. The inqui&s;itive mind labours to extend its knowledge to the mo&s;t di&s;tant climes and re|mote antiquity; and craves other materials for the exerci&s;e of its reflecting powers, than can be derived from occa&s;ional and de&s;ultory conver&s;a|tion. Now, by what means can this laudable curio&s;ity be &s;o effectually &s;atisfied, as by the pe|ru&s;al of judicious and well cho&s;en books? Not that I would depreciate the value of good com|pany (for I e&s;teem it highly;) but add its many
<PB N="181" REF="033748_0179_0FF92F3C56685400">
advantages to tho&s;e which reading affords. This combination mu&s;t have a happy tendency to give us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, both of the virtues and graces; and to render our attainments at once &s;olid and ornamental.</P>
<P>What think you, Caroline? Do you agree with me in opinion? Let me hear from you by the fir&s;t opportunity; and believe me your's mo&s;t &s;incerely.</P>

<P>I THANK you, my dear friend, for the book you were &s;o obliging as to &s;end me; and for the letter which accompanied it. The book I had read; but, as you ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, I mu&s;t be a gainer by a &s;econd peru&s;al.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ubject of reading, I perfectly ac|cord with you in &s;entiment. It is an amu&s;e|ment, of which I was always enthu&s;ia&s;tically fond. Mrs. Williams regulated my ta&s;te; and, by di|recting and maturing my judgment, taught me to make it a &s;ource of refined and &s;ub&s;tantial plea&s;ure. I do not wi&s;h to pur&s;ue &s;tudy as a profe&s;&s;ion, nor to become a learned lady; but I would pay &s;o much attention to it, as to ta&s;te the delights of literature, and be qualified to bear a part in rational and improving conver&s;ation. Indeed, I would trea&s;ure up &s;uch a fund of u&s;e|ful knowledge, as may properly direct my cour&s;e through life, and prove an antidote again&s;t the vexations and di&s;appointments of the world. I think, Sophia, that our &s;ex &s;tand in &s;pecial need of &s;uch a re&s;ource to beguile the &s;olitary hours which a dome&s;tic &s;tation commonly impo&s;es.

<OPENER><DATELINE>BOSTON.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SO often, my dear Maria, has the pen of the divine, the morali&s;t, and the noveli&s;t been employ|ed on the &s;ubject of female frailty and &s;educ|tion; and &s;o pathetically has each de&s;cribed the folly and mi&s;ery of the fatal delu&s;ion which in|volves many in di&s;grace, that I am a&s;toni&s;hed when I &s;ee tho&s;e, who have the be&s;t means of in|formation, heedle&s;sly &s;acrificing their reputation, peace and happine&s;s, to the &s;pecious arts of the libertine! In this ca&s;e, it is common for our &s;ex to rail again&s;t the other, and endeavour to excite the pity of the world by painting the advantage which has been taken of their credulity and weakne&s;s. But are we not &s;ufficiently appri&s;ed of the enemies we have to encounter? And have we not adequate motives to circum&s;pection and firmne&s;s?</P>
<P>I am generally an advocate for my own &s;ex; but when they &s;uffer them&s;elves to fall a prey to &s;educers, their pu&s;illanimity admits no excu&s;e. I am bold to affirm that every woman, by behaving with propriety on all occa&s;ions, may not only re|&s;i&s;t temptation, but repel the fir&s;t attempts upon her honor and virtue.</P>
<P>That levity of deportment, which invites and encourages de&s;igners, ought &s;tudiou&s;ly to be
<PB N="185" REF="033748_0183_0FF93002010546B8">
avoided. Flattery and vanity are two of the mo&s;t dangerous foes to the &s;ex. A fondne&s;s for admiration in&s;en&s;ibly throws them off their guard, and leads them to li&s;ten and give credit to the profe&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who lie in wait to deceive.</P>
<P>The following remarks, though &s;evere, per|haps, can hardly be deemed incon&s;i&s;tent with the character which their author a&s;&s;umes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ladies' Friend.</NOTE> "Wo|men would do well to forbear their declamations again&s;t the fal&s;ity and wickedne&s;s of men; the fault is theirs, to fall into &s;uch coar&s;e-&s;pun &s;nares as are laid for them.</P>
<P>"That &s;ervile ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s which women &s;hould immediately look upon as the mark of fraud, and which &s;hould make them apprehend a &s;urpri&s;e, is the very thing which allures them, and renders them &s;oon the victims of perjury and incon&s;tan|cy; the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of a di&s;po&s;ition which fixes their inclinations on &s;uperficial qualities. It is this di&s;po&s;ition which draws after them a crowd of empty &s;ops, who, if they have any meaning at all, it is only to deceive. Something plea&s;ing in a man's per&s;on, a giddy air, a perpetual levity, &s;upply the place of valuable endowments."</P>
<P>A recent, and &s;ingular adventure has rendered ob&s;ervations of this &s;ort peculiarly &s;triking to my mind; which may account for the &s;ubject and the length of this letter.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="033748_0184_0FF9302E0104D570">I will give you a detail of it, though I mu&s;t conceal the real names of the parties concerned.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, the weather being very fine, and the &s;leighing excellent, &s;everal of our family, with two or three friends, were induced to make an excur&s;ion a few miles into the country. We &s;topped at a hou&s;e which had formerly been a tavern, and in which we had often been well en|tertained on &s;imilar occa&s;ions. As we were in ha&s;te to receive the benefit of a good fire, we did not notice the removal of the &s;ign, nor advert to the po&s;&s;ibility of its being converted to a pri|vate man&s;ion. Being very cold, I &s;tepped fir&s;t out of the &s;leigh, and ran ha&s;tily in; leaving the gentlemen to exerci&s;e their gallantry with the other ladies. The room I entered had no fire. I therefore opened the door which led to the next apartment, when I beheld the beautiful and admired Clarinda &s;itting in an ea&s;y chair, pale and wan, with an infant in her arms! I &s;tood mute and motionle&s;s, till the woman of the hou&s;e appeared to conduct me to another room. Con|fu&s;ion and &s;hame were vi&s;ibly depicted in Cla|rinda's countenance; and, unable to meet my eye, &s;he threw her handkerchief over her face, and fell back in her chair.</P>
<P>I followed the good woman, and, apologizing for my intru&s;ion, told her the cau&s;e. She rec|ollected my having been there before, and read|ily excu&s;ed my freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="033748_0185_0FF930586801B6E8">By this time the re&s;t of the company, who had been &s;hown into a decent parlour, were in|quiring for me; and I could &s;carcely find oppor|tunity to reque&s;t my conductre&s;s to a&s;k Clarinda's forgivene&s;s in my name, and to a&s;&s;ure her of my &s;ilence, before I had joined them. I a&s;&s;umed an appearance of cheerfulne&s;s very foreign to the feelings of my heart, and related my mi&s;take without any mention of the melancholy di&s;cov|ery I had made. We prevailed on the woman to accommodate us with tea and coffee, as we wi&s;hed to ride no further. While preparations were making, &s;he came in to lay the table, and as &s;he withdrew gave me a token to follow her; when &s;he informed me that Clarinda had been extremely overcome by my detecting her &s;itua|tion; but being &s;omewhat recovered, de&s;ired a private interview. I accordingly repaired to her apartment, where I found her bathed in tears. Pity operated in my brea&s;t, and with an air of tenderne&s;s I offered her my hand; but &s;he with|held her's, exclaiming in broken accents, O no! I am polluted&mdash;I have forfeited your friend&s;hip &mdash;I am unworthy even of your compa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>I begged her to be calm, and promi&s;ed her that &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer no inconvenience from my knowledge of her condition.</P>
<P>She thanked me for my a&s;&s;urances, and &s;ub|joined that, &s;ince &s;he knew the candour and gen|ero&s;ity of my di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he would entru&s;t me
<PB N="188" REF="033748_0186_0FF9305F19AEBCD0">
with every circum&s;tance relative to her &s;hameful fall; when, after a con&s;iderable pau&s;e, &s;he pro|ceeded nearly in the following words.</P>
<P>"Though our acquaintance has been for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pended, and though we have lived in different parts of the town, yet common fame has doubtle&s;s informed you that I was addre&s;&s;ed by the gay, and to me, too charming Florimel! To the mo&s;t captivating form, he &s;uperadded the winning graces of politene&s;s, and all tho&s;e in&s;inuating arts which imperceptibly engage the female heart.</P>
<P>"His flattering attentions, and apparent ardour of affection were to my inexperienced and &s;u&s;|ceptible mind proofs of his &s;incerity; and the effu&s;ions of the mo&s;t lively pa&s;&s;ion were returned with un&s;u&s;pecting confidence.</P>
<P>"My father, &s;trict in his principles, and watch|ful for my real welfare, di&s;approved his &s;uit; al|leging that although Florimel was calculated to plea&s;e in the gayer moments of life, he was nev|erthele&s;s de&s;titute of tho&s;e &s;entiments of religion and virtue, which are e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite to du|rable felicity. But I could not be per&s;uaded that he lacked any perfection which maturer years would not give him; and therefore finding my attachment unconquerable, my father re|luctantly acquie&s;ced in the propo&s;ed connexion. My ill-judged partiality for this ungenerous man ab&s;orbed every other pa&s;&s;ion and pur&s;uit; while
<PB N="189" REF="033748_0187_0FF93068D5B163F8">
he took advantage of my yielding fondne&s;s, and a&s;&s;umed liberties which I knew to be incon&s;i&s;tent with delicacy, but had not re&s;olution to repel. One encroachment &s;uccceded another, and every conce&s;&s;ion was claimed and granted as a proof of love, till at length he became ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of my will and my per&s;on! Shame and remor&s;e &s;oon rou&s;ed me to a &s;en&s;e of my guilt, and I de|manded an immediate performance of his prom|i&s;e of marriage. This, under one pretext or an|other, he con&s;tantly evaded. His vi&s;its daily be|came le&s;s frequent, and his attentions le&s;s a&s;&s;id|uous; while the mo&s;t poignant angui&s;h of mind deprived me of every comfort. I found my&s;elf reduced to the humiliating alternative of entreat|ing my &s;educer to &s;creen me from infamy by the name of wife, though he &s;hould never con&s;ider or treat me as &s;uch. To this he in&s;ultingly re|plied, that my &s;ituation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily detect our illicit commerce; and his pride could never brook the reputation of having a wife who&s;e cha&s;tity had been &s;acrificed. As &s;oon as rage and re&s;entment, which at fir&s;t took from me the power of utterance, would permit, Wretch! ex|claimed I, is it not to you the &s;acrifice has been made? Who but you has triumphed over my virtue, and &s;ubjected me to the di&s;grace and wretchedne&s;s I now &s;uffer? Was it not in token of my regard for you that I yielded to your &s;o|licitations? And is this the requital I am to re|ceive?
<PB N="190" REF="033748_0188_0FF9309279D51D60">
Ba&s;e, ungrateful man! I de&s;pi&s;e your meanne&s;s! I dete&s;t the ungenerous di&s;po&s;ition you betray, and henceforth reject all intercour&s;e and &s;ociety with you! I will throw my&s;elf on the mercy of my injured parents, and renounce you forever.</P>
<P>"Seeing me almo&s;t frantic, he endeavoured to &s;oothe and appea&s;e me. He apologized for the har&s;hne&s;s of his language, and even made profe&s;|&s;ions of unabated affection; but gave as a rea|&s;on for deferring the conjugal union, at pre&s;ent, that commercial affairs obliged him to &s;ail im|mediately for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> me at the &s;ame time that on his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> would not fail to re|new and con&s;ummate the connexion. To this I gave no credit, and therefore made no reply. He then reque&s;ted me to accept a pur&s;e to de|fray my expen&s;es, during his ab&s;ence, which I rejected with di&s;dain; and he departed. The di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;pair of my mind were inexpre&s;|&s;ible. For &s;ome days, I re&s;igned my&s;elf entirely to the agonizing pangs of grief. My parents imputed my dejection to Florimel's departure, and &s;trove to con&s;ole me. It was not long, however, before my mother di&s;covered the real cau&s;e. In her, re&s;entment gave place to com|pa&s;&s;ion; but the anger of my father could not be appea&s;ed. He ab&s;olutely forbad me his pre&s;|ence for &s;ome time; but my mother at length prevailed on him to &s;ee, and a&s;&s;ure me of for|givene&s;s
<PB N="191" REF="033748_0189_0FF930BDC35E78F8">
and re&s;toration to favour, if I would con&s;ent to renounce and di&s;own my child; to which, not then knowing the force of maternal affection, I readily con&s;ented. This place was privately procured for me, and hither, under pretence of &s;pending a month or two with a friend in the country, I retired. To-morrow my dear babe is to be taken from me! It is to be put to nur&s;e, I know not where! All I am told is, that it &s;hall be well taken care of! Con&s;tant|ly will its moans haunt my imagination, while I am deprived even of the hope of mini&s;tering to its wants; but mu&s;t leave it to execrate the hour which gave it birth, and deprived it of a parent's attention and kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall return to my fa|ther's hou&s;e; and as I am unknown here, and you are the only per&s;on, out of our family, who &s;hares the dreadful &s;ecret, I flatter my&s;elf that my crime may &s;till be concealed from the world. The reproaches of my own mind I can never e&s;|cape. Con&s;cious guilt will give the a&s;pect of accu&s;ation to every eye that beholds me; and however policy may compel me to wear the ma&s;k of gaiety and ea&s;e, my heart will be wrung with inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h by the remembrance of my folly, and always alive to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;ations of remor&s;e and &s;hame! Oh Julia! you have witne&s;&s;ed my di&s;grace! pity and for|give me! Perhaps I once appeared as virtuous

and re&s;pectable, as you now do; but how changed! how fallen! how deba&s;ed! Learn from my fate to de&s;pi&s;e the flattery of the worth|le&s;s coxcomb, and the arts of the abandoned libertine."</P>
<P>By this time I was &s;ummoned to tea; when, giving all the con&s;olation in my power to the unhappy Clarinda, I rejoined my company; and to prevent their inqui&s;itivene&s;s about my ab|&s;ence, told them I had been with a &s;ick woman, upon whom I accidentally intruded when I fir&s;t came in; and that &s;he had detained me, all this time, by a recital of her complaints and misfor|tunes. This account &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity; but the melancholy into which my mind had been thrown was not ea&s;ily di&s;&s;ipated; nor could I, without doing violence to my feelings, put on the appearance of my u&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Here, my dear Maria, is a picture of the frail|ty and weakne&s;s of our &s;ex! How much rea&s;on have we then to "watch and pray that we enter not into temptation!"</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS much affected by the woe-fraught tale which you gave me in your la&s;t. We can|not too much regret that &s;uch in&s;tances of du|plicity and folly are ever exhibited. They are alike di&s;graceful to both &s;exes, and demon&s;trate the deba&s;ing and fatal tendency of the pa&s;&s;ions, when &s;uffered to predominate.</P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervations upon our &s;ex I believe to be ju&s;t, though many would probably deem them &s;evere. However, I think it not much to the honor of the ma&s;culine character, which the God of nature de&s;igned for a defence and &s;afeguard to female virtue and happine&s;s, to take advantage of the tender affection of the un&s;u&s;pecting and too credulous fair; and, in return for her love and confidence, perfidiou&s;ly to de&s;troy her peace of mind, and deprive her of that reputation, which might have rendered her a u&s;eful and or|namental member of &s;ociety. True, we ought to take warning by &s;uch examples of treachery and deceit; yet, how much more conducive to the honor and happine&s;s of our &s;pecies, were there no occa&s;ion to apprehend &s;uch ungenerous requitals of our &s;incerity and frankne&s;s!</P>

When the paragraph re|&s;pecting Clarinda's di&s;owning her child was read, &s;he ha&s;tily ro&s;e, and in broken accents begged leave to withdraw. This was granted, without any inquiry into the cau&s;e; though our curio&s;|ity, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, was much excited.

<P>"I am," &s;aid &s;he, "the illegitimate offspring of parents, whom I am told are people of fortune and fa&s;hion. The fear of di&s;grace overcame the dictates of natural affection, and induced my mother to abandon me in my infancy. She accord|ingly gave me away, with a large &s;um of money, which &s;he vainly imagined would procure me kind and good treatment. But, unhappily for me, the people to whom I was con&s;igned, avail|ing them&s;elves of their &s;ecurity from in&s;pection and inquiry, abu&s;ed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and expo&s;ed me to the greate&s;t hard&s;hips. As they were per&s;ons of vulgar minds and unfeeling hearts, they did not commi&s;erate my friendle&s;s condition. My quick &s;en&s;ibility incurred their di&s;plea&s;ure or deri&s;ion. I was often in&s;ultingly

reproached with the misfortune of my birth; while the tears which the&s;e ungenerous reflec|tions extorted from me, were either mocked or puni&s;hed. I had a thir&s;t for knowledge; but they allowed me no time for acquiring it, alleg|ing that they could not &s;upport me in idlene&s;s, but that I mu&s;t earn my living, as they did their's, by hard labour. Oppre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e in&s;ults, I bore the galling yoke of their authority with the utmo&s;t impatience. When &s;creened from ob&s;er|vation, my tears flowed without re&s;traint; and the idea of my parents' cruelty, in thus &s;ubject|ing me to infamy and wretchedne&s;s, continually haunted my imagination. Sometimes I fancied my mother in view, and, expo&s;ing my tattered raiment, expo&s;tulated with her concerning the indignities I &s;uffered, and the unrea&s;onable hard|&s;hip of leaving me to bear all the puni&s;hment of my guilty birth! At other times I painted to my&s;elf a father, in &s;ome gentleman of plea&s;ing a&s;pect; and fondly indulged the momentary tran&s;|port of throwing my&s;elf at the feet of one, whom I could call by that venerable and endearing name! Too &s;oon, however, did the rever&s;e of parental tenderne&s;s awake me from my delu&s;ive reveries.</P>
<P>"In this manner I lingered away my exi&s;t|ence, till I was twelve years old; when going, one day, to the hou&s;e of a gentleman in the neighbourhood, to which I was often &s;ent to &s;ell

herbs, and other trifles, I was directed into the parlour, where the mo&s;t beautiful &s;ight in nature opened to my view; while the contra&s;t between my own &s;ituation, and that of children ble&s;&s;ed with affectionate parents, gave me the mo&s;t pain|ful &s;en&s;ations. The lady of the hou&s;e was &s;ur|rounded by her four &s;ons, the elde&s;t of whom was reading le&s;&s;ons, which &s;he mo&s;t pathetically inculcated upon all. As the door was open, I &s;tood &s;ome minutes unob&s;erved; and was &s;o de|lighted with the tender accents in which her in|&s;tructions were imparted, and the cheerful obe|dience with which they were received, that I had no di&s;po&s;ition to interrupt them.</P>
<P>"At length I was &s;een, and bid to come in. But, when que&s;tioned about my errand, I was &s;o ab&s;orbed in the contemplation of maternal and filial love, exhibited in this happy group, that my tongue refu&s;ed utterance, and I bur&s;t into tears. The children gathered around, and inquired what ailed the poor little girl? But when the lady took me by the hand, and kindly a&s;ked what was the matter, I could not re&s;train or conceal my feelings. When my tears had relieved me, I related the cau&s;e of my grief; de&s;cribing my own &s;ituation, and the effect which its contra&s;t had produced on my mind.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR ANNA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY contemplated vi&s;it to Harmony-Grove mu&s;t be deferred. A &s;evere illne&s;s has lately con|fined my mamma to her chamber. This claimed all my time and attention, and called me to a new &s;cene of care; that of a family, which I was obli|ged to &s;uperintend during her indi&s;po&s;ition. Her recovery has, at length, re&s;tored tranquillity and joy to our abode; but &s;he has not yet re&s;umed the direction of her hou&s;ehold affairs. To this, &s;he tells me, &s;he is reconciled by the hope, that expe|rience may render me an adept in dome&s;tic econ|omy. Indeed, Anna, I think this an e&s;&s;ential branch of female education; and I que&s;tion whether it can be acquired by mere &s;pecula|tion. To me it is plain, that every lady ought to have &s;ome practice in the management of a family, before &s;he takes upon her&s;elf the im|portant tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Do not many of the mi&s;takes and infelicities of life ari&s;e from a deficiency in this point?</P>
<P>Young ladies of fa&s;hion are not obliged to the ta&s;k, and have too &s;eldom any inclination to per|form duties which require &s;o much time and at|tention; and with which, perhaps, they have in|judiciou&s;ly

been taught to connect the idea of &s;ervility. Hence it is, that when called to pre&s;ide over families, they commit many errors, during their novitiate, at lea&s;t, which are alike detrimen|tal to their intere&s;t and happine&s;s. How nece&s;|&s;ary is it, then, to avoid this complication of evils by a &s;ea&s;onable application to tho&s;e offices of hou&s;ewifery, which may one day become our province.</P>
<P>Early ri&s;ing, I find a great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my pre&s;ent occupation. It is almo&s;t incredible how much may be gained by a diligent improvement of tho&s;e hours which are but too commonly lo&s;t in &s;leep. I aro&s;e this morning with the dawn. The &s;erenity of the &s;ky and the fragrance of the air invited me abroad. The calmne&s;s which uni|ver&s;ally prevailed &s;erved to tranquillize my mind, while the receding &s;hades of night, and the ri&s;ing beams of day formed a contra&s;ted a&s;&s;emblage of the beautiful, the &s;plendid, the &s;olemn, and the &s;ublime. The &s;ilence which pervaded the &s;ur|rounding &s;cenery was interrupted only by the melody of the feathered &s;ong&s;ters, who &s;eemed to rejoice in this undi&s;turbed opportunity of prai&s;|ing their Maker. My heart expanded with grat|itude and love to the all-bountiful Author of na|ture; and &s;o ab&s;orbed was I in the mo&s;t delight|ful meditations, that I &s;aw with regret the hour approaching which mu&s;t again call me to the ac|tive

<SALUTE>DEAR HARRIOT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SINCERELY thank you for your affec|tionate letter, by the la&s;t po&s;t, and for the book with which it was accompanied. The very title is &s;ufficient to rou&s;e the feelings and attract the attention of the patriotic mind. Beacon-Hill claims a con&s;picuous place in the hi&s;tory of our country. The &s;ubject of this poem mu&s;t be highly intere&s;ting to every true American; while the genius it di&s;plays cannot fail to gratify every poetical ta&s;te. Philenia's talents ju&s;tly entitle her to a rank among the literary ornaments of Columbia.</P>
<P>I have been reviewing Millot's Elements of An|cient and Modern Hi&s;tory; and recommend it to your re-peru&s;al. It is undoubtedly the mo&s;t u&s;e|full compendium extant. The tedious minute|ne&s;s and prolix details of &s;ieges and battles, ne|gociations and treaties, which fatigue the reader and oppre&s;s the memory, in mo&s;t works of the kind, are happily avoided in this; while the ele|gance, &s;implicity, conci&s;ene&s;s and per&s;picuity of the &s;tyle, render it intelligible to every capacity, and plea&s;ing to every ta&s;te. To tho&s;e who have a reli&s;h for hi&s;tory, but want lei&s;ure to give it full &s;cope, Millot is well calculated to afford both

information and entertainment. It is an objec|tion, commonly made by our &s;ex to &s;tudies of this nature, that they are dry and elaborate; that they yield little or no exerci&s;e to the more &s;pright|ly faculties of the mind; that the attention is confined to an unintere&s;ting and barren detail of facts, while the imagination pants in vain for the flowery wreaths of decoration.</P>
<P>This is a plau&s;ible excu&s;e for tho&s;e who read only for amu&s;ement, and are willing to &s;acrifice rea&s;on, and the enlargement of their minds, to the gaudy phantom of a day; but it can never be &s;atisfactory to the per&s;on, who wi&s;hes to combine utility with plea&s;ure, and dignity with relaxation. Hi&s;tory improves the under&s;tanding, and furni&s;hes a knowledge of human nature and human events, which may be u&s;eful, as well as ornamental, through life. "Hi&s;tory," &s;ays the late celebrated Ganganelli, "brings together all ages and all mankind into one point of view. Pre&s;enting a charming land&s;cape to the mental eye, it gives colour to the thoughts, &s;oul to the actions, and life to the dead; and brings them again upon the &s;tage of the world, as if they were again living; but with this difference, that it is not to flatter&punc; but to judge them."</P>
<P>The duties and avocations of our &s;ex will not often admit of a clo&s;e and connected cour&s;e of reading. Yet a general knowledge of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubjects may undoubtedly be gained,

<SALUTE>MY DEAR MARIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I wrote you la&s;t, I have made an agreeable vi&s;it to my good friend, Sylvia Star. After rambling in the fields and gardens till we were fatigued, we went into her brother's library. He was in a &s;tudious attitude, but gave us a po|lite reception. We are come to &s;olicit a portion of your repa&s;t, Amintor, &s;aid I. Be &s;o kind as to furni&s;h us with &s;ome in&s;tructive page, which combines entertainment and utility; and while it informs the mind, delights the imagination. I am not happy enough to know your ta&s;te re&s;pect|ing books, &s;aid he; and, therefore, may not make a proper &s;election. Here, however, is an author highly &s;poken of by a lady, who has lately added to the number of literary publications; handing me Sterne's Sentimental Journey. I clo&s;ed and returned the book. You have indeed mi&s;taken my ta&s;te, &s;aid I. Wit, blended with indelicacy, never meets my approbation. While the fancy is allured, and the pa&s;&s;ions awakened, by this pa|thetic humouri&s;t, the foundations of virtue are in&s;idiou&s;ly undermined, and mode&s;t dignity in&s;en|&s;ibly betrayed. Well, &s;aid he, &s;miling, perhaps you are &s;eriou&s;ly inclined. If &s;o, this volume of &s;ermons may po&s;&s;ibly plea&s;e you. Still le&s;s, re|joined

I. The &s;erious mind mu&s;t turn with di&s;|gu&s;t from the levity which pervades the&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es, and from the indecent flow of mirth and humour, which converts even the &s;acred wri|tings, and the mo&s;t &s;olemn &s;ubjects of religion, into frolic and buffoonery. Since &s;uch is your opinion of this celebrated writer, &s;aid he, I will not in&s;ult your feelings by offering you his Tri&s;|tram Shandy. But here is another wit, famous for his "<HI>purity.</HI>" Yes, &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> ob&s;cene and vul|gar ideas, if ill-natured remarks and filthy allu|&s;ions be purity, Swift undoubtedly bears the palm from all his contemporaries. As far as grammat|ical correctne&s;s and &s;implicity of language can de&s;erve the epithet, his advocates may enjoy their &s;entiments unmole&s;ted; but, in any other &s;en&s;e of the word, he has certainly no claim to "<HI>purity.</HI>" I conceive his works, notwith&s;tanding, to be much le&s;s pernicious in their tendency, than tho&s;e of Sterne. They are not &s;o enchanting in their nature, nor &s;o &s;ubtle in their effects. In the one, the noxious in&s;inuations of licentious wit are concealed under the artful blandi&s;hments of &s;ympathetic &s;en&s;ibility; while we at once recoil from the rude a&s;&s;ault which is made upon our delicacy, by the roughne&s;s and vulgarity of the other.</P>
<P>Choo&s;e then, &s;aid Amintor, for your&s;elf. I availed my&s;elf of his offer, and &s;oon fixed my eyes upon Doctor Belknap's Hi&s;tory of New-Hamp&s;hire,

<SALUTE>DEAR ANNA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RETIRED, after breakfa&s;t this morning, determined to indulge my&s;elf in my favourite amu&s;ement, and write you a long letter. I had ju&s;t mended my pen and folded my paper, when I was informed that three ladies waited for me in the parlour. I &s;tepped down and found Lu|cinda P&mdash;, Fulvia F&mdash;, and Delia S&mdash;. They were gaily dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;till more gaily di&s;|po&s;ed. "We called," &s;aid they, "to invite you, Mi&s;s Maria, to join our party for a &s;hopping tour." Loath to have the ideas di&s;&s;ipated, which I had collected in my pericranium, for the pur|po&s;e of tran&s;mitting to a beloved &s;i&s;ter, I decli|ned accepting their invitation; alleging that I had no occa&s;ion to purcha&s;e any thing to-day; and therefore begged to be excu&s;ed from accompa|nying them. They laughed at my rea&s;on for not engaging in the expedition. "Buying," &s;aid their principal &s;peaker, "is no con&s;iderable part of our plan, I a&s;&s;ure you. Amu&s;ement is what we are after. We frankly acknowledge it a delightful gratification of our vanity, to traver&s;e Cornhill, to receive the ob&s;equious congees, and to call forth the gallantry and activity of the beaux be|hind the counter; who, you mu&s;t know, are ex|tremely

alert when we belles appear. The wa|ving of our feathers, and the attractive airs we a&s;|&s;ume, command the profounde&s;t attention, both of ma&s;ter and apprentices; who, duped by our appearance, &s;uffer le&s;s brilliant cu&s;tomers to wait, or even to depart without notice, till we have tumbled over and refu&s;ed half the goods in the &s;hop. We then bid a very civil adieu; expre&s;s our regret at having given &s;o much trouble; are a&s;&s;ured, in return, that it has been rather a plea&s;|ure; and leave them their labour for their pains."</P>
<P>A mo&s;t in&s;ignificant amu&s;ement this, &s;aid I to my&s;elf! How little can it redound to the honor and happine&s;s of the&s;e unthinking girls, thus to &s;quander their time in folly's giddy maze! They undoubtedly wi&s;h to attract eclat; but they would do well to remember tho&s;e words of the &s;atiri&s;t, which, with the alteration of a &s;ingle term, may be applied to them:</P>
<L>"<HI>Columbia's</HI> daughters, much more fair than nice,</L>

<L>Worn in the public eye, give cheap delight</L>
<L>To <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and tarni&s;h to the &s;ated &s;ight."</L>
<P>Viewing their conduct in this light, I with|&s;tood their &s;olicitations, though I palliated my re|fu&s;al in &s;uch a manner as to give no umbrage.</P>
<P>Of all expedients to kill time, this appears to me, as I know it will to you, the mo&s;t ridicu|lous and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="033748_0208_0FF932FAF74E2848">What po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction can re&s;ult from &s;uch a practice? It certainly fatigues the body; and is it any advantage to the mind? Does it enlarge the under&s;tanding, in&s;pire u&s;eful ideas, or furni&s;h a &s;ource of plea&s;ing reflection? True, it may gratify a vitiated imagination, and exhilarate a light and trifling mind. But the&s;e ought to be re&s;trained and regulated by rea&s;on and judgment, rather than indulged.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h tho&s;e ladies, who make plea&s;ure the &s;u|preme object of their pur&s;uit, and argue in vin|dication of their conduct, that
<Q><L>Plea&s;ure is good, and <HI>they</HI> for plea&s;ure made,</L></Q>
would confine, them&s;elves to that &s;pecies which
<Q><L>Neither blu&s;hes, nor expires.</L></Q></P>
<P>The dome&s;tic virtues, if duly cultivated, might certainly occupy tho&s;e hours, which they are now &s;olicitous to di&s;&s;ipate, both with profit and delight. "But it is time enough to be dome&s;ticated," &s;ay they, "when we are placed at the head of fami|lies, and nece&s;&s;arily confined to care and labour."</P>

<P>THE extracts which you tran&s;mitted to me in your la&s;t kind letter, my dear Sophia, from your favourite author, Doctor Young, corre&s;|ponded exactly with the &s;olemnity infu&s;ed into my mind by the funeral of a neighbour, from which I had ju&s;t returned.</P>
<P>I agree with you, that the Night-Thoughts are good devotional exerci&s;es. It is impo&s;&s;ible to read them with that degree of attention which they merit, without being affected by the im|portant and awful &s;ubjects on which they treat. But Young, after all, is always too ab&s;tru&s;e, and in many in&s;tances, too gloomy for me. The mo&s;t elaborate application is nece&s;&s;ary to the comprehen&s;ion of his meaning and de&s;ign; which, when di&s;covered, often tend rather to depre&s;s than to elevate the &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Thomp&s;on is much better adapted to my ta&s;te. Sentiment, elegance, per&s;picuity, and &s;ublimity are all combined in his Sea&s;ons. What an inimitable painter! How admirably he de|&s;cribes the infinitely variegated beauties and op|erations of nature! To the feeling and &s;u&s;cep|tible heart they are pre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t light. Nor is the energy of his language le&s;s perceivable, when he de&s;cribes the Deity riding

<L>"How chang'd the &s;cene! In blazing height of noon,</L>

<L>Still horror reigns, a di&s;mal twilight round,</L>
<L>Of &s;truggling night and day malignant mix'd.</L>

<SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY <HI>her</HI> de&s;ire, in conjunction with my own inclination, I inform you that Harriot Henly is no more&mdash;Ye&s;terday &s;he gave her hand, and renounced her name together; threw a&s;ide the &s;prightly girl we have been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to admire, and &s;ub&s;tituted in her place the dig|nified and re&s;pectable head of a family, in Mrs. Farmington.</P>
<P>Have I not lo&s;t my amiable friend and a&s;&s;o|ciate? Will not her change of &s;ituatiton tend to le&s;&s;en our intercour&s;e, and to alienate our af|fections?</P>
<P>When I contemplate the &s;ocial circle, &s;o firm|ly cemented in the bands of friend&s;hip, at the boarding &s;chool, where the mo&s;t perfect har|mony, ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction pre&s;ided, I recoil at the idea of becoming le&s;s dear, le&s;s intere&s;ting, and le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to each other. It is with the utmo&s;t reluctance that I admit the idea of rivals to that affection and benevolence which we have, &s;o long, and &s;o &s;incerely interchanged.</P>
<P>The charm however is broken. Harriot is al|ready married; and my friends are extremely &s;o|licitous that I &s;hould follow her example. But in a connexion which requires &s;o many pre|cautions

before it is formed, and &s;uch uninter|rupted circum&s;pection and prudence afterwards; the great uncertainty of the event in&s;pires me with timidity and apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Harriot put into my hands, and I read with plea&s;ure, the book which you recommended to her on the &s;ubject. But &s;till we wi&s;hed for your in&s;truction and advice. The &s;entiments of a per&s;on &s;o dear and intere&s;ting to us, are particu|larly calculated to engage our attention, and in|fluence our conduct. Relying, too, on your judgment and experience, your forming pen may render us more worthy objects of attachment.</P>
<P>We, however, unite in a&s;&s;uring you of our gratitude for all pa&s;t favours; and in pre&s;enting our &s;incere regards to the young ladies.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>HARMONY-GROVE.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR LAURA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE obligations under which you lay me, by your generous confidence, and affectionate expre&s;&s;ions of regard, induce me again to a&s;&s;ume the Preceptre&s;s towards you, and to gratify your wi&s;hes, by imparting my &s;entiments on your pre&s;|ent &s;ituation and pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>I am told by my daughter, who had the honor of bearing your letter, that you are, what I al|ways expected you would be, an object of gen|eral admiration. Yet, I tru&s;t, your good &s;en&s;e will enable you duly to di&s;tingui&s;h and treat the &s;everal candidates for your favour.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, my young friend, a matter of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equence, which lies upon your mind, and awakens your anxiety. Your friends are &s;tudious of your welfare, and kindly concerned that the important die on which the happine&s;s of your life depends, &s;hould be judiciou&s;ly ca&s;t. You doubtle&s;s remember, that I di&s;cour&s;ed upon this &s;ubject in my concluding le&s;&s;ons to your cla&s;s.</P>
<P>Di&s;parity of tempers, among other things which were then &s;ugge&s;ted, and which you will doubtle&s;s recollect, was repre&s;ented, as tending to render life uncomfortable. But there are other di&s;pari|ties which may be equally ho&s;tile to your peace.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="033748_0217_0FF9334E6E9BF220">Di&s;parity of years is very apt to occa&s;ion the indulgence of pa&s;&s;ions de&s;tructive of conjugal fe|licity. The great difference between the &s;pright|ly fancy, vivacity, and enterprize of youth, and the deliberate caution, phlegmatic coldne&s;s, and &s;ententious wi&s;dom of age, render them very unplea&s;ant companions to each other. Marriage between per&s;ons of the&s;e oppo&s;ite de&s;criptions is commonly the re&s;ult of pecuniary motives, with one party, at lea&s;t: the &s;u&s;picion of this, in the other, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce di&s;content, unea&s;i|ne&s;s, and di&s;affection.</P>
<P>Age is naturally jealous of re&s;pect, and appre|hen&s;ive of being &s;lighted. The mo&s;t trifling and unmeaning inattentions will therefore be con&s;tru|ed ami&s;s. For an exce&s;&s;ive de&s;ire of being objects of &s;upreme regard is almo&s;t invariably accompa|nied with a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of being the rever&s;e. Hence accu&s;ations, reproaches, and re&s;traints, on the one &s;ide, produce di&s;gu&s;t, re&s;entment and ali|enation on the other, till mutual and uncea&s;ing wretchedne&s;s en&s;ue. Indeed, where intere&s;t alone, without this inequality of years, is the principal inducement, marriage is &s;eldom happy. E&s;teem and love are independent of wealth and its appendages. They are not to be &s;old or bought. The conjugal relation is &s;o near and in|tere&s;ting; the mind, as well as the per&s;on, is &s;o intimately concerned in it, that &s;omething more
<PB N="220" REF="033748_0218_0FF9336B2012B180">
&s;ub&s;tantial and engaging than gold is requi&s;ite to make it a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Marriage, being the commencement of a do|me&s;tic life, be&s;ide the many agreeable circum|&s;tances attending it, has its peculiar cares and troubles, which require the &s;olace of a compan|ion actuated by better principles, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more amiable endowments than outward &s;plen|dour and magnificence can afford. In the hour of &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, riches, it is true, can be|&s;tow bodily comforts and cordials; but can they be made an equivalent for the tender &s;ympathy, the endearing kindne&s;s, and the alleviating atten|tion of a bo&s;om friend, kindly a&s;&s;iduous to ea&s;e our pains, animate our pro&s;pects, and beguile the languid moments which elude all other con&s;ola|tions? The &s;orrows as well as the joys of a family &s;tate, are often &s;uch as none but a bo&s;om friend can participate. The heart mu&s;t be enga|ged before it can repo&s;e with ea&s;e and confidence. To a lady of &s;en&s;ibility, the confinement of the body, without the con&s;ent and union of accord|ing minds, mu&s;t be a &s;tate of inexpre&s;&s;ible wretch|edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Another &s;ituation, not le&s;s to be deplored, is a connexion with the immoral and profane.</P>
<P>How &s;hocking mu&s;t it be, to hear that &s;acred NAME, which you revere and love, con&s;tantly treated with levity and irreverence! And how painful the nece&s;&s;ity of being con&s;trained, for the
<PB N="221" REF="033748_0219_0FF933891FFF8B28">
&s;ake of peace, to witne&s;s in &s;ilence; and without even the appearance of di&s;approbation, the mo&s;t &s;hameful outrages upon religion and virtue! May you never ta&s;te the bitterne&s;s of this evil!</P>
<P>Intemperance is a vice, which one would im|agine no lady would overlook in a &s;uitor. But, &s;trange to tell! there are tho&s;e, even among our own &s;ex, who think and &s;peak of inebriation in the other, at the jovial and well-furni&s;hed board, as a mark of conviviality and good fellow&s;hip!</P>
<P>What, then, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing badge of hu|manity? Can that rea&s;on, which alone rai&s;es us &s;uperior to the brute creation, be wantonly &s;ac|rificed with impunity; yea, with reputation?</P>
<P>How degrading and how dreadful mu&s;t this enormity appear to an intere&s;ted, affectionate, and virtuous wife! What agonizing pangs of mortification and angui&s;h mu&s;t &s;he endure, when &s;he meets him, in who&s;e &s;ociety &s;he delights, who&s;e return &s;he has anticipated with impatience, and who&s;e happine&s;s and honor are the moving &s;prings of her life, intoxicated with wine; the powers of his mind &s;u&s;pended by the poi&s;onous cup, and every faculty ab&s;orbed in the deadly draught! What a perpetual &s;ource of dread and apprehen|&s;ion mu&s;t hence ari&s;e; and how often mu&s;t the blu&s;h of indignant virtue and wounded delicacy be called forth!</P>
<P>The game&s;ter is an equally dangerous compan|ion. His family is robbed, not only of his company
<PB N="222" REF="033748_0220_0FF932494DC03BB0">
and his talents, but of that property, to the ben|efit of which they have an indi&s;putable claim. His earnings are &s;quandered among worthle&s;s and profligate a&s;&s;ociates abroad; while the faithful partner of his life, and perhaps, too, a ri&s;ing off|&s;pring, langui&s;h at home for want of bread!</P>
<P>How fatal is the tendency of &s;uch examples! How can that father inculcate the duties of pi|ety, virtue and decency, who exhibits the rever&s;e of each in his own conduct? And under what an un&s;peakable di&s;advantage mu&s;t that mother labour, in the in&s;truction and education of her children, who&s;e admonitions, coun&s;els, and di|rections are practically counteracted by him who ought to bear an equal &s;hare of the burden! The government and &s;uperintendence of a fam|ily are objects of &s;uch magnitude and import|ance, that the union and co-operation of its heads are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. It is a little commonwealth; and if internal feuds and di&s;&s;en|&s;ions ari&s;e, anarchy and confu&s;ion mu&s;t en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Dome&s;tic happine&s;s is the foundation of every other &s;pecies. At times, indeed, we may enjoy our&s;elves abroad, among our friends; but a good heart will return home, as to the &s;eat of felicity.</P>
<L>"&mdash;Home is the re&s;ort</L>
<L>Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where,</L>
<L>Supporting and &s;upported, poli&s;h'd friends</L>
<L>And dear relations mingle into bli&s;s."</L>
<P><PB N="223" REF="033748_0221_0FF933BCD8471680">Since &s;o much, then, depends upon a judicious choice, how important is it, that you examine well before you decide; and that you di&s;pen&s;e with no quality in the man to whom you &s;hall give your hand, which is e&s;&s;ential to the virtue and happine&s;s of your life. For this purpo&s;e, con&s;ult your judgment, rather than your fancy; and &s;uffer not &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments, but &s;olid merit to preponderate.</P>
<P>I have now endeavoured to point out the mo&s;t apparent and threatening dangers to which you may be expo&s;ed. But though the&s;e are avoided, many unfore&s;een accidents will doubt|le&s;s occur to cloud your &s;anguine hopes. The&s;e, when there are no vices to produce them, may ari&s;e from follies, and from the indulgence of er|roneous expectations. Little mi&s;under&s;tandings &s;ometimes occa&s;ion di&s;agreements which termi|nate in coldne&s;s and di&s;affection, and plant a root of bitterne&s;s which can hardly be eradicated.</P>
<P>Let prudence, therefore, be your pole-&s;tar, when you enter the married &s;tate. Watch with the greate&s;t circum&s;pection over your&s;elf; and always exerci&s;e the tendere&s;t affection, the mo&s;t unwearied patience, and the mo&s;t cheerful ac|quie&s;cence in the treatment of your companion. Guard e&s;pecially again&s;t being affected by tho&s;e little inattentions and foibles, which too often give pain and umbrage without de&s;ign; and produce tho&s;e remon&s;trances, criminations, and
<PB N="224" REF="033748_0222_0FF933E2EA836C40">
retorts, which are the great inlets of &s;trife, and bane of love.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t bear, with calmne&s;s, every thing that the &s;incere&s;t de&s;ire of peace can dictate; and &s;tu|diou&s;ly avoid every expre&s;&s;ion, and even look, which may irritate and offend. Your own hap|pine&s;s, you will con&s;ider &s;o intimately connected with that of your hu&s;band, as to be in&s;eparable; and con&s;equently, that all your hopes of comfort in this life, and perhaps, too, in the next, depend upon your conducting with propriety and wi&s;|dom towards him.</P>
<P>I take the liberty, through you, to convey my congratulations to Mrs. Farmington. May her change of condition be happy, to the full extent of our mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, and benev|olent wi&s;hes. I fully intended writing her on the &s;ubject, but have unwarily be&s;towed &s;o much time upon you, that for the pre&s;ent, I mu&s;t fore|go the plea&s;ure. Some things in this letter, which you will doubtle&s;s communicate, are ap|plicable to her ca&s;e. The&s;e &s;he will receive as friendly hints from me; and I am confident that her known di&s;cretion will continue to &s;hed a be|nign and engaging influence upon her whole de|portment, and render her uniformly re&s;pected and beloved.</P>
<P>The bearer is waiting, and I can only add, that I remain your &s;incere and affectionate friend.</P>

<P>THE plea&s;ing hope with which you in|&s;pired me, when we parted la&s;t, of receiving a vi&s;it from you in town, has been con&s;tantly cheri&s;hed. I have anticipated your arrival with the utmo&s;t impatience; but have endeavoured, notwith&s;tanding, to beguile the &s;low-paced hours by a u&s;eful and plea&s;ing occupation; the revi|&s;ion of my geographical &s;tudies.</P>
<P>My papa has kindly procured me Doctor Mor&s;e's la&s;t, and much improved edition of Uni|ver&s;al Geography, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a pair of globes he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, has afforded me the mo&s;t delightful entertainment. When at &s;chool, I thought this the mo&s;t agreeable &s;tudy allotted me; never deeming it a ta&s;k, but an amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>It affords me, as it mu&s;t every true American, the &s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure to be furni&s;hed with the means of acquiring this favourite &s;cience, by my own countryman; and the &s;pirit of Columbian independence exults in my bo&s;om, at the idea of being able to gain an accurate acquaintance with my own and other countries, without recour&s;e to the labours of foreigners.</P>
<P>I think the pre&s;ent generation under &s;pecial obligations to the active indu&s;try of Dr. Mor&s;e,

in providing us with that nece&s;&s;ary and rich fund of information, which his Geography and Gaz|etteer contain. From the&s;e &s;ources we may de|rive a &s;ufficient knowledge of the world we in|habit, without departing from our dome&s;tic &s;phere.</P>
<P>Come, then, my dear Cleora, and without fa|tigue or expen&s;e, we will make the tour of the globe together. After inve&s;tigating the local &s;it|uation of different and di&s;tant climes, we will turn to the hi&s;toric page, and examine the man|ners, government, character, and improvements of their inhabitants. We will traver&s;e the frozen wa&s;tes of the frigid zones, and the burning &s;ands of the equatorial region; then return and ble&s;s the temperate and happy medium in which we are placed; and, ca&s;ting an eye around, exult in our peculiar advantages of &s;oil and &s;ituation, peace and good government, virtue and religion.</P>
<P>The fine mornings of this &s;ea&s;on afford many delightful hours, before the heat of the day re|laxes the mind and enervates the body. Come, then, enjoy and improve the&s;e, in concert with your faithful and affectionate friend,</P>

<P>LAST Thur&s;day, after having concluded the u&s;ual occupations and &s;edentary amu&s;ements of the day, I walked out, towards evening, to enjoy the benefit of a cool and fragrant air, and the &s;erenity and beauty of tho&s;e rural &s;cenes which have a powerful tendency to &s;oothe and tranquillize the mind. When I had rambled in the fields, to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, I cro&s;&s;ed into the road, to return home free from the in|convenience of the dew, which had begun to fall.</P>
<P>I had not proceeded far, when I ob&s;erved a female, who had the appearance of youth and misfortune, &s;itting by the wall in a pen&s;ive atti|tude, with an infant in her lap. When I ap|proached her, &s;he aro&s;e, and in the mo&s;t humble and pathetic accents, be&s;ought me to direct her to &s;ome &s;helter, where &s;he might repo&s;e her weary limbs for the night. The a&s;pect and lan|guage of di&s;tre&s;s awakened my compa&s;&s;ion. To know &s;he really needed charity, was a &s;ufficient inducement with me to be&s;tow it, without &s;cru|pulou&s;ly inquiring whether &s;he de&s;erved it or not. I therefore told her to follow me, and I would conduct her to a lodging.</P>
<P>As we walked on, I que&s;tioned her re&s;pecting the place of her nativity, her parentage, and the
<PB N="228" REF="033748_0226_0FF93472267FD1D8">
rea&s;on of her being reduced to the &s;ituation in which I had found her. She informed me that &s;he was born in Ireland; that her parents brought her into this country, before her re|membrance; that while &s;he was very young, they both died, and left her to the protection and mercy of &s;trangers; that &s;he was bandied from one to another, in the village where Providence had ca&s;t her lot, till &s;he was able to earn her own living: "and &s;ince that time," &s;aid &s;he, "I believe the character of an hone&s;t and indu&s;tri|ous girl will not be refu&s;ed me." How then, &s;aid I, came you by this incumbrance? pointing to the child. "In that," replied &s;he, "I am verily guilty. Brought up in ignorance of tho&s;e principles of decency, virtue and religion, which have kept <HI>you</HI> innocent, Madam, I was ruined by a deceitful man, who, under the ma&s;k of love, and with the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es of mar|riage, betrayed my confidence, and left me to reap the bitter fruits of my credulity. The woman where I lived, when &s;he di&s;covered my &s;ituation, ordered me to leave her hou&s;e imme|diately. It was no matter, &s;aid &s;he, how much I &s;uffered, or what became of me. On my own head, &s;he told me, my iniquity &s;hould fall; &s;he would not lighten the burden, if it were in her power.</P>
<P>"Some of the neighbours informed me, that &s;he had rea&s;on to be &s;evere upon my fault, being once in the &s;ame condemnation her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="033748_0227_0FF934958B7AB0B0">"Having no friend who could a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I ap|plied to the &s;electmen of the town, who provided for me till I was able to work, and then told me I mu&s;t &s;hift for my&s;elf; offering, however, to keep the child, which I refu&s;ed, being determined it &s;hould never &s;uffer for want of a mother's care, while I had life.</P>
<P>"I am now wandering in pur&s;uit of employ|ment, that the labour of my hands may &s;upport my&s;elf and little one. This has been often de|nied me, either for fear my child &s;hould be trouble&s;ome, or becau&s;e my character was &s;u&s;|pected. I have &s;ometimes &s;uffered &s;o much from fatigue and want, that I have de&s;paired of relief, and heartily wi&s;hed both my&s;elf and my babe in the grave."</P>
<P>On examination, I found her knowledge con|fined entirely to dome&s;tic drudgery; that &s;he had never been taught either to read or write. She appears, notwith&s;tanding, to have good natural &s;en&s;e; and a quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, and readine&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eldom equalled in her &s;phere of life.</P>
<P>I conducted her into the kitchen, and de&s;ired &s;he might have &s;upper, and a bed provided for her. My mamma, who&s;e benevolent heart and liberal hand are always ready to relieve the nece&s;|&s;itous, was plea&s;ed to approve my conduct; and having kept her through the next day, and ob|&s;erved her di&s;po&s;ition and behaviour, hired her as
<PB N="230" REF="033748_0228_0FF934BBCBBC0740">
a &s;ervant; and we have rea&s;on to believe, from her apparent fidelity and grateful exertions, that our kindne&s;s will be well repaid. I have even extended my charity further, and undertaken to teach her to read. She is very tractable; and I expect to be amply rewarded for my labour, by her improvements.</P>
<P>Indeed, Matilda, it is melancholy to &s;ee our fellow-creatures reared up, like the brute crea|tion; neither in&s;tructed how to live above their animal appetites, nor how to die as Chri&s;tians, when they have fini&s;hed their toil&s;ome career!</P>
<P>This girl is only &s;eventeen. Her age, there|fore, as well as her docility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ivene&s;s, encourage the plea&s;ing hope of re&s;toring her to the paths of rectitude and peace. I &s;hall en|deavour, as opportunity offers, to in&s;til into her &s;u&s;ceptible mind, the principles of virtue and re|ligion; and, perhaps, I may lead her to the love and practice of both, and render her a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety. Her fate impre&s;&s;es, more forcibly than ever, on my mind, the importance of a good education, and the obligations it con|fers. Had you or I been &s;ubjected to the &s;ame ignorance, and the &s;ame temptations, who can &s;ay that we &s;hould have conducted better? How many fall for want of the directing hand of that parental love and friend&s;hip, with which we are ble&s;&s;ed! Contra&s;ting our &s;ituation with her's, how much have <HI>we</HI> to account for, and how in|excu&s;able
<PB N="231" REF="033748_0229_0FF934D6EBC56608">
&s;hall <HI>we</HI> be, if we violate our duty, and forfeit our dignity, as rea&s;onable creatures!</P>
<P>That extreme bitterne&s;s and acrimony, which is &s;ometimes indulged, again&s;t per&s;ons who are unhappily &s;educed from the way of virtue, may operate as a di&s;couragement to all de&s;igns and en|deavours to regain it: whereas, the &s;oothing voice of forgivene&s;s, and the con&s;equent pro&s;pect of being re&s;tored to reputation and u&s;efulne&s;s, might rou&s;e the attention, and call forth the ex|ertions of &s;ome, at lea&s;t, who, through de&s;pair of retrieving their characters, abandon them&s;elves to vice, and adopt a cour&s;e, alike di&s;graceful to their &s;ex, and to human nature.</P>
<P>But, though I advocate the principles of phi|lanthropy and Chri&s;tian charity, as extending to &s;ome very &s;pecial ca&s;es, I am far from &s;uppo&s;ing this fault generally capable of the lea&s;t extenua|tion. Whatever allowance may be made for tho&s;e, who&s;e ignorance occa&s;ions their ruin, no excu&s;e can be offered for others, who&s;e education, and opportunities for knowing the world and them&s;elves, have taught them a better le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>I need not, however, be at the pains to enforce this truth upon you: and, as my head is &s;o full of the &s;ubject, that I have no di&s;po&s;ition to write upon any thing el&s;e, I will put an end to this in|coherent &s;croll, by annexing the name of your &s;incere and faithful friend,</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR CAROLINE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAPPENING to be in my chamber, this morning, the maid came running up &s;tairs in &s;uch violent ha&s;te, as to put her&s;elf fairly out of breath. Will you be &s;o kind, Mi&s;s Sophia, &s;aid &s;he, as to lend me a quarter of a dollar? I put my hand into my pocket, and found I had no &s;mall change. I have nothing le&s;s than a dollar, Su&s;an, &s;aid I; but, if it is a matter of con&s;equence to you, I will go to my mamma, and procure it for you. She was loath to give me that trouble; but, if I would, it would really oblige her very much in|deed. Her &s;olicitude excited my curio&s;ity. Will you inform me what you want it for? &s;aid I. O yes; &s;he believed it was no harm&mdash;But there was a woman in the wood-hou&s;e, who told for|tunes; and &s;he wi&s;hed to know her's, but could not without the money. A woman who tells fortunes! &s;aid I. What fortunes? the pa&s;t, or the future? The future, to be &s;ure, Ma'am, re|joined &s;he. Ay, how does &s;he know them? &s;aid I. Has &s;he been let into the &s;ecret de&s;igns of Providence? or can &s;he divine the my&s;teries of fate? She tells fortunes by cards, Ma'am, &s;aid &s;he; and I really believe &s;he tells true. Can you imagine, &s;aid I, that a knowledge of your de&s;tiny in life, is to be gained from any po&s;&s;ible arrange|ment
<PB N="233" REF="033748_0231_0FF935050445C7D0">
of a pack of cards? Why not, Ma'am? Many people have been told exactly what was to happen. You may depend on it, Su&s;an, &s;aid I, you are deceived. The Almighty, who di&s;po&s;es all events according to his &s;overeign plea&s;ure, does not unveil futurity to mortals, e&s;pecially to <HI>&s;uch</HI> mortals, who, by an idle vicious cour&s;e of life, counteract his laws, and di&s;regard his au|thority. I would willingly give you the money, twice told, if you needed it; but I cannot con|&s;ent to your being impo&s;ed on, by this worthle&s;s vagrant, who has no other de&s;ign than to pick your pocket.</P>
<P>The girl departed at the&s;e words; and, though I felt an emotion of regret at refu&s;ing to gratify her, yet my rea&s;on and con&s;cience forbad my be|ing acce&s;&s;ary to the fraud.</P>
<P>This curio&s;ity to explore the hidden coun&s;els of the Mo&s;t High, prevails not only among &s;ervants, but even many, from whom better things might be expected, are under its infatuating influence.</P>
<P>The Supreme Being has, for wi&s;e and benevo|lent rea&s;ons, concealed from us the future inci|dents of our lives. A humble reliance on his power and goodne&s;s, accompanied with a cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence, is what the Lord our God requireth of us.</P>
<P>I have heard my mamma relate an anecdote of a particular friend of her's, who was impo&s;ed on very &s;eriou&s;ly in this way.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="033748_0232_0FF9351F2F053B40">A gentleman, whom I &s;hall call Sylvander, was very deeply in love with her; but his per&s;on, and, much more, his di&s;po&s;ition and manners, were extremely di&s;gu&s;ting to her. Aver&s;e to the very idea of a connexion with him, &s;he accord|ingly refu&s;ed his addre&s;&s;es. Yet he had art &s;uffi|cient to intere&s;t her friends in his behalf; who, pitying his &s;ituation, endeavoured to &s;often the heart of the obdurate fair. But in vain they &s;trove to conciliate her affections.</P>
<P>In defiance of all oppo&s;ition, however, he in|ce&s;&s;antly obtruded his vi&s;its, till &s;he reluctantly admitted them; and being &s;omewhat coquetti&s;h, &s;he at times received him more benignly; which flattered his hopes of ultimately accompli&s;hing his wi&s;hes. Finding his ardent &s;uit of but little avail, and perceiving that he made but &s;mall progre&s;s towards gaining her favour, he had re|cour&s;e to art. Surpri&s;ing her, one day; in clo&s;e confabulation with a fortune-teller, the idea im|mediately &s;truck him, that he might effect, through this mean, what all his a&s;&s;iduity and &s;olicitations could never in&s;ure. He communicated his plan to a female friend, who was equally the confi|dent of both parties. Directed by him, &s;he con|ver&s;ed with Sylvia on the &s;ubject; profe&s;&s;ed her belief in the &s;kill of the&s;e jugglers; and appeared de&s;irous of taking this mea&s;ure to learn her fate. Sylvia joined in her opinion and wi&s;hes; and away they tripped together on the important er|rand.
<PB N="235" REF="033748_0233_0FF9353B068C21D8">
Meanwhile, Sylvander had been to the fellow who was to reveal their de&s;tinies; and, bribing him to favour the de&s;ign, left him, in|&s;tructed what an&s;wers to make to their interro|gations.</P>
<P>They arrived, and propo&s;ed their bu&s;ine&s;s. The mediums of information, a pack of cards, were brought forth, and my&s;teriou&s;ly arranged. Syl|via's curio&s;ity was on tip-toe. She li&s;tened with profound attention to his oracular wi&s;dom; and believed him really in&s;pired, when he told her, that her former lover, for whom &s;he had a great regard, was gone to a foreign country. This &s;he knew to be true, and therefore gave him full cre|dence, when he added, that he would never live to return; and when he proceeded &s;till further to ob&s;erve, that another gentleman of great merit now courted her; that &s;he was not fond of his addre&s;&s;es, but would &s;oon &s;ee his worth and her own error; give him her hand, and be happy.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he &s;o artfully blended the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent, which &s;he knew, with the future which Sylvander wi&s;hed, and had therefore dictated, that &s;he was firmly per&s;uaded he dealt with &s;ome invi&s;ible power, and that fate had, indeed, pre|de&s;tined her to the arms of Sylvander. Con|vinced of this, &s;he attended to his overtures more placidly, contemplated his per&s;on and endow|ments with le&s;s aver&s;ion, and endeavoured to reconcile her&s;elf to the unavoidable event.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="033748_0234_0FF935512BAA0250">This &s;he effected; and not long after, he ob|tained her in marriage, and triumphed in the &s;ucce&s;s of his duplicity.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time, her other lover returned. Di&s;appointment and de&s;pair pre&s;ided in his brea&s;t. He &s;aw Sylvia, upbraided her with her incon&s;tancy, and declared him&s;elf utterly ruined. Pity and returning love operated in her mind, and rendered her completely wretched. She mo&s;t &s;everely condemned her own folly, in li&s;|tening to the dictates of a mi&s;guided curio&s;ity; and acknowledged her&s;elf ju&s;tly puni&s;hed, for pre&s;uming to pry into the &s;ecret de&s;igns of Heaven.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;trolling pretenders to foreknowledge are peculiarly dangerous to the weak-minded and credulous part of the community; and how it happens that they are ever encouraged, is to me inconceivable. Did they actually give the infor|mation they promi&s;e, how much rea&s;on &s;hould we have to avoid them! How many &s;ources of grief would be opened, by the anticipation of future evils, of which, now, we have no appre|hen&s;ion! and how often &s;hould we be deprived of the con&s;olatory hope of a &s;peedy deliverance from pre&s;ent &s;ufferings!</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR ANNA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A MOST melancholy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing event has &s;pread a gloom over the face of the metrop|olis. Every heart heaves the &s;ympathetic &s;igh, and every eye drops the tear of regret. The very &s;udden death of Doctor Clarke, who was &s;eized with an apoplectic fit, in the mid&s;t of his &s;ermon, ye&s;terday afternoon, and expired this morning, is a &s;ubject of univer&s;al lamentation.</P>
<P>Not only we, who had the happine&s;s to &s;it un|der his mini&s;try, and to enjoy his particular friend&s;hip and attention, but the whole town; and, indeed, the public at large have &s;u&s;tained a great lo&s;s in his departure. Amiable in his di&s;|po&s;ition, engaging in his manners, and benevo|lent in his whole deportment, he conciliated the affections of every cla&s;s. His talents as a &s;cholar, philo&s;opher, and divine, commanded the re&s;pect of the mo&s;t judicious and learned; while the elegance, per&s;picuity and delicacy of his &s;tyle, joined with the undi&s;&s;embled &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of his manner, rendered him uniformly acceptable to the devout. In every condition and relation of life, he was exemplary as a Chri&s;tian; and as a preacher, an air of per&s;ua&s;ion invariably accom|panied him, which arre&s;ted the attention of the mo&s;t heedle&s;s auditors.</P>

<P>He was particularly attractive to young people. While he charmed their ear, he convinced their under&s;tanding, and excited them to the love and practice of virtue.</P>
<P>A &s;triking example of this occurred &s;ome years ago, which I will take the liberty to relate. He preached in a neighbouring church on the&s;e words, "She that liveth in plea&s;ure is dead while &s;he liveth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Timothy, v.6.</NOTE> In this di&s;cour&s;e he painted tho&s;e al|lurements of plea&s;ure which &s;urround the young and gay; more e&s;pecially of our &s;ex, in the mo&s;t ju&s;t and lively colours. He repre&s;ented, in pathetic, engaging and refined language, the &s;nares to which they are expo&s;ed, and the mo&s;t probable means of e&s;caping them. He exhibited, with all their attractions, the native charms of virtue, and pourtrayed vice in its true deformity. He de|&s;cribed, in the mo&s;t animating terms, the re&s;pect|ability, u&s;efulne&s;s, and happine&s;s of tho&s;e who undeviatingly adhere to the path of rectitude

and innocence; and, with tbe mo&s;t energetic and affectionate tenderne&s;s, warned the youth to avoid the devious walks of vice and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>A number of young ladies, who had been his hearers, happening to be together in the evening, united in the wi&s;h to expre&s;s their gratitude to him; but not having a per&s;onal acquaintance with him, could devi&s;e no better method than wri|ting.

<SALUTE>REVEREND SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE well known candour of your di&s;po|&s;ition, and your apparent zeal for the promotion of religion and virtue, embolden us to flatter our&s;elves, that you will pardon this method of conveying to you our &s;incere and united thanks for your very &s;ea&s;onable, judicious, and u&s;eful di&s;cour&s;e, delivered la&s;t Sunday morning, at our meeting.</P>
<P>It is much to be lamented, that the depravity of the age is &s;uch, as to render &s;ermons of this nature ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary; and it is almo&s;t mat|ter of equal regret, that we have &s;o &s;eldom op|portunities of being benefited by them.</P>
<P>That we oftener hear than receive in&s;truc|tion, is a truth which can neither be denied, nor evaded; and can only be accounted for, by that
<PB N="240" REF="033748_0238_0FF8C97946117B68">
pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s for plea&s;ure, which prevails to &s;uch a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, as to precipitate its votaries into whatever presents it&s;elf under this deluding a&s;pect, without con&s;idering whether it be durable, or fleeting.</P>
<P>It is certainly a mo&s;t humiliating reflection, that our &s;ex (which is the female) &s;hould ever take more pains to gain the qualifications of agreeable triflers than of rational friends; or be more anxious to become <HI>amu&s;ing,</HI> than u&s;eful com|panions. But, Sir, does not &s;uch conduct in la|dies too often receive the mo&s;t flattering en|couragement from the gentlemen? How &s;eldom is intrin&s;ic merit di&s;tingui&s;hed; and the &s;erious, prudent female preferred, even by tho&s;e who &s;tyle them&s;elves men of &s;en&s;e and penetration, to the airy flaunting coquette!</P>
<P>The con&s;tant attention which is paid to tho&s;e who make the gaye&s;t appearance, and the ap|plau&s;e which is lavi&s;hed upon her who has the large&s;t portion of external graces and fa&s;hionable embelli&s;hments, induce many who entertain the good-natured de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, to be&s;tow more of their time and care on the cultivation of tho&s;e &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments, which they find nece&s;&s;ary to render them acceptable to mo&s;t circles into which they fall, than upon the acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial virtues, which they daily &s;ee neglected and ridiculed; though, at the &s;ame time, perhaps, they are convinced of the &s;upe|rior &s;atisfaction which the latter would afford.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="033748_0239_0FF935F15B33C690">But it is needle&s;s for one &s;ex to criminate the other. We allow, that, generally &s;peaking, they are equally to blame. In this in&s;tance, however, as the male a&s;&s;ume the prerogative of &s;uperior judgment and intellectual abilities, they ought to prove the ju&s;tice of their claim by &s;etting no|bler examples, and by endeavouring to reform whatever tends to vitiate the ta&s;te and corrupt the morals of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Yet, after all, the evil cannot be effectually remedied, but by the concurrent exertions of both: and we are humbly of opinion, that if this refor|mation were more frequently inculcated from the pulpit, in the delicate, engaging, and pious man|ner of the di&s;cour&s;e which now excites our grat|itude to you, and our re&s;olutions to conduct ac|cordingly, it would be efficacious in bringing about &s;o de&s;irable an event.</P>
<P>We entreat your pardon, Reverend Sir, for the freedom, prolixity, and errors of this epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>Though per&s;onally unknown to you, we doubt not you will readily grant it, when we a&s;&s;ure you, that we are actuated by a &s;incere regard to the intere&s;ts of religion and morality, and by a grate|ful &s;en&s;e of your exertions in the glorious cau&s;e.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR CLEORA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;hortne&s;s of time is a very common &s;ubject of complaint; but I think the mi&s;u&s;e of it, a much more ju&s;t one. Its value is certainly under-rated by tho&s;e who indulge them&s;elves in morning &s;loth.</P>
<P>Sweet, indeed, is the breath of morn; and af|ter the body has been refre&s;hed by the re&s;toring power of &s;leep, it is peculiarly prepared to pro|cure and participate the plea&s;ures of the mind. The jarring pa&s;&s;ions are then compo&s;ed, and the calm operations of rea&s;on &s;ucceed of cour&s;e; while</P>

<L>Native perfumes, and whi&s;per whence they &s;tole</L>
<L>The&s;e balmy &s;poils."</L>
<P>The morning is undoubtedly a &s;ea&s;on, of all oth|ers, mo&s;t favourable to u&s;eful exertions. Tho&s;e, therefore, who lo&s;e three or four hours of it, in &s;lumbering inaction, make a voluntary &s;acrifice of the be&s;t part of their exi&s;tence. I ro&s;e to-day, not with the &s;un, but with the dawn; and after taking a few turns in the garden, retired to the &s;ummer-hou&s;e. This, you know, is a favourite hour with me.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR MATILDA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS, la&s;t week, at Bo&s;ton; and, having occa&s;ion for a new hat, &s;tepped into a milliner's &s;hop to inquire the mode. The milliner repli|ed, that it was not yet in her power to an&s;wer my que&s;tion. "The &s;pring &s;hips," &s;aid &s;he "are la|ter than common; but their arrival is hourly ex|pected, when we &s;hall be furni&s;hed with mem|orandum-books which will a&s;certain and deter|mine the fa&s;hion for the &s;ea&s;on." What &s;he meant by memorandum-books, I could not con|ceive. I had always &s;uppo&s;ed them blanks, de|&s;igned for noting whatever occurred, without in|convenience. Unwilling, however, to be thought a &s;imple country-girl, totally unacquainted with the world, I &s;ought no explanation from her; but repaired to a particular friend for in&s;truction. From whom I learned that the chief value of the&s;e &s;ame memorandum-books con&s;i&s;ts in their containing imported cuts of ladies' head-dre&s;&s;es, hats, and other habiliments, which are always &s;ure to be admired and imitated, as the perfection of ta&s;te and propriety!</P>
<P>This di&s;covery mortified me exceedingly. It ju&s;tified, beyond any thing which I had ever &s;u&s;|pected to exi&s;t as a fact, what I once heard a Eu|ropean
<PB N="247" REF="033748_0245_0FF9367B289F5E48">
a&s;&s;ert, "that Americans had neither char|acter nor opinion of their own."</P>
<P>With due deference to tho&s;e better judges, who de&s;pi&s;e the &s;implicity of our ance&s;tors, and labour to introduce the corrupt manners and cu&s;toms of the old world into our country, I cannot but think it extremely ridiculous for an independent nation, which di&s;cards all foreign influence, glo|ries in its freedom, and boa&s;ts of its genius and ta&s;te, &s;ervilely to ape exotic fa&s;hions, even in ar|ticles of dre&s;s and fanciful ornaments.</P>
<P>Have not the daughters of Columbia &s;uffi|cient powers of invention to decorate them&s;elves? Mu&s;t we depend upon the winds and waves for the form, as well as the materials of our garb? Why may we not follow our own inclination; and not be deemed finical or prudi&s;h in our ap|pearance, merely becau&s;e our habit is not exactly corre&s;pondent with the pretty pictures in the memorandum-books, la&s;t imported?</P>
<P>It is &s;incerely to be regretted that this &s;ubject is viewed in &s;o important a light. It occupies too much of the time, and engro&s;&s;es too much of the conver&s;ation of our &s;ex. For one, I have &s;erious thoughts of declaring independence.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>HARMONY-GROVE.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR CAROLINE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO tell you that I am &s;orry for your lo&s;s, or that I &s;ympathize with you in your affliction, would be but the language you daily hear; and often, perhaps, from the unfeeling and indiffer|ent. But you will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that I take a particular intere&s;t in your concerns, and really &s;hare your grief. A holy Providence has wounded you by a &s;troke, which is extremely painful and &s;evere. Your be&s;t friend is &s;hrouded in the grave. In the maternal brea&s;t, your fond|e&s;t affections, and mo&s;t un&s;u&s;pecting confidence have hitherto concentred; and who can provide you with an equivalent &s;ub&s;titute? To the al|mighty Father and Friend of creation, it becomes you to repair for comfort and &s;upport.</P>
<P>The dying advice and coun&s;el of your dear mamma, which, you inform me, were pathetic, in&s;tructive and con&s;olatory, will be a guide to your feet. Often realize the &s;olemn &s;cene, and remember, that, "though dead, &s;he yet &s;peaketh."</P>
<P>You have great cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s, that &s;he was &s;pared to direct you &s;o far through the in|tricate and dangerous path of youth; to complete
<PB N="249" REF="033748_0247_0FF936A3A2606270">
your education; to teach you, by her example, how to acquit your&s;elf with u&s;efulne&s;s and honor; and, above all, to furni&s;h you with that important knowledge, to which every thing el&s;e &s;hould be made &s;ub&s;ervient&mdash;how to die!</P>
<P>An era of your life has now commenced, which is no le&s;s important than affecting. That a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand, which formerly led you, is now cold and lifele&s;s! Tho&s;e lips, from which you have been accu&s;tomed to receive information and ad|vice, are &s;ealed in perpetual, &s;ilence! And that heart, which always glowed with the warme&s;t &s;oli|citude for your happine&s;s, has cea&s;ed to palpitate!</P>
<P>You mu&s;t now think and act for your&s;elf. As the elde&s;t daughter, you will be placed at the head of your father's family. You mu&s;t, there|fore, adopt a plan of conduct, conducive to its harmony, regularity, and intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Filial duty to your &s;urviving parent, more ten|derly inculcated by your participation of his heavy bereavement, will lead you to con&s;ult his inclination, and &s;edulou&s;ly contribute all in your power to lighten the burden of dome&s;tic arrange|ments devolved upon him. While he laments the death of a prudent, affectionate, and beloved wife, give him rea&s;on to rejoice, that he is ble&s;&s;ed with a daughter, capable of &s;oothing the pains, alleviating the cares, and heightening the enjoy|ments of his life.</P>
<P>Your brothers and &s;i&s;ters will look up to you as the guide of their tender years. While their
<PB N="250" REF="033748_0248_0FF936C058E0AAE8">
weeping eyes and pathetic accents are directed towards you, let kindne&s;s, di&s;cretion, and patience, characterize your deportment, and engage their confidence and love.</P>
<P>Having mentioned your duty to others, I can|not di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject without dropping a few hints for your direction, in regard to your per|&s;onal behaviour.</P>
<P>A very important charge is committed to you, as well in the duties which you owe to your&s;elf, as in the &s;uperintendence of your father's family.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign Di&s;po&s;er of all things has, at an early age, made you, in a mea&s;ure, your own guardian. Your father's bu&s;ine&s;s calls him much abroad. With you, therefore, he is obliged to entru&s;t, not only his dome&s;tic concerns; but, what is &s;till more dear to his heart, the care of your own per&s;on and mind; of your own reputation and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tanced as you are, company has the mo&s;t powerful charms. Your's is now the pre|rogative of receiving and returning vi&s;its in your own name. At home, you are &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of ceremonies. This is extremely alluring to the &s;prightly fancy of youth. But time, you will remember, is too important a ble&s;&s;ing to be &s;ac|rificed to a promi&s;cuous crowd of unimproving companions. Be&s;ides, the character of a young lady will nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ullied by the imputation of being con&s;tantly engaged in parties of plea&s;|ure,
<PB N="251" REF="033748_0249_0FF936C48F4CD6F0">
and exhilarating amu&s;ement. Flattery often avails it&s;elf of the unguarded moments of gaiety; and, in&s;inuating its in&s;idious charms into the heedle&s;s and &s;u&s;ceptible mind, inflates it with pride and vanity, and produces an affectation and air of &s;elf-importance, which are peculiarly di&s;|gu&s;ting, becau&s;e ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from that true dignity of manners, which re&s;ults from con|&s;cious rectitude. Genuine merit is always mode&s;t and una&s;&s;uming; di&s;&s;ident of it&s;elf, and re&s;pect|ful to others.</P>
<P>Your father has a right to your unlimited con|fidence. You will, therefore, make him your chief friend and coun&s;ellor. Though he may not po&s;&s;e&s;s all the winning &s;oftne&s;s of a mother, he doubtle&s;s has as ardent an affection for you, and as &s;incere a de&s;ire to promote your welfare. Hence you may &s;afely repo&s;e your deare&s;t con|cerns in his paternal brea&s;t, and receive, with the utmo&s;t deference, his kind in&s;truction and advice. Let his judgment have an entire a&s;cendency over your mind and actions, e&s;pecially in your inter|cour&s;e and &s;ociety with the other &s;ex. Con&s;ider him as better acquainted with their merit, cir|cum&s;tances, and views, than you can be; and, &s;hould you contemplate a connexion for life, let his opinion determine your choice.</P>
<P>Watch over your dear little &s;i&s;ters, with all the tenderne&s;s of fraternal affection; be their protect|tor and friend; in&s;til into their minds the prin|ciples
<PB N="252" REF="033748_0250_0FF936E32C182988">
of virtue and religion; arm them again&s;t the &s;nares and temptations by which they will be &s;urrounded; and lead them, by your own conduct, in the way of truth and peace.</P>
<P>When you have lei&s;ure and inclination to write, the effu&s;ions of your pen will always be acceptable to your &s;incere and faithful friend,</P>
