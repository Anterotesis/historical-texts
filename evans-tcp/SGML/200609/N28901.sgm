<HEAD>THE NARRATIVE OF MR. JOHN SOREN.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>&rindx; IT has &s;eldom happened that the wrongs of an Individual have had a greater claim to the attention of the Public than tho&s;e which are the &s;ubject of the following Narrative. The generous and di&s;intere&s;ted conduct of the benefactor has never been more &s;trikingly contra&s;ted with the ingratitude and per&s;idy of the object of his humanity: the national character of Engli&s;hmen was never more di&s;honoured than in the character of Captain Potter of the <HI>I&s;abella;</HI> and the credit of Government was never more deeply intere&s;ted in any thing than in taking care that the injuries of <HI>Mr. SOREN</HI> &s;hall not remain unredre&s;&s;ed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. JOHN SOREN, a native of Bo&s;ton, in the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, a citizen of the United States of America, and a partner in the hou&s;e of Holyoke and Soren, in Bo&s;ton, being, in the month of November, in the year 1795, at Ham|burgh, freighted an American &s;hip called the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> then lying there, of the burthen of 170 la&s;ts, or 340 tons, on a voyage from thence to Surinam, and from Surinam back to Hamburgh. The &s;hip was the property of Mr. Clough, of Witchca&s;&s;et, in the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, al&s;o a native and citizen of America. The charter-party was made between Mr. Soren, on behalf of Mr, Holyoke and him&s;elf, as freighters, and Wyatt St. Barbe, a native of England, and
<PB N="4" REF="038531_0003_10125093D1776F80">
30 years a citizen of America, but then re&s;iding at Ham|burgh, as ma&s;ter and commander of the &s;hip, on behalf of the owner. By that charter-party <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Charter-party, Appendix, No. 1.</NOTE>, dated the 24th of Novem|ber 1795, and regularly atte&s;ted by a notary-public, the freighters engaged to &s;hip on board the ve&s;&s;el, on her &s;afe ar|rival at Surinam, a full convenient cargo of We&s;t-Indian products, to be brought back to the port of Hamburgh, and to make the Captain's allowance of privilege, as in &s;imilar ca&s;es: the &s;tipulated freight for the outward and homeward voyage was 2600<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling, with 15<HI>l.</HI> per cent. primage for the whole &s;hip's hold. The object of Mr. Soren was, to &s;hip at Hamburgh a &s;ufficient cargo fit for the market at Su|rinam; and, by the produce of that cargo, and by means of letters of credit which he had obtained on Surinam, to the amount of nearly 15,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling in the whole, to purcha&s;e, at Surinam, coffee &s;ufficient to load, not only the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> but &s;everal other &s;hips, which he intended to freight at Suri|nam or other ports, the comparative prices of that article, at Surinam and at Hamburgh, at that time affording him the be&s;t ground to expect that his adventure would prove a very profitable &s;peculation. In pro&s;ecution of this object, he &s;hip|ped on board the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> at Hamburgh, goods to the amount, in prime co&s;t, of 3200<HI>l.</HI> and upwards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Bills of Lading and Invoice, No. 2 and 3 in the Appendix.</NOTE>, and cau&s;ed in&s;urances to be effected on them, and on the &s;uppo&s;ed pro|fits, by underwriters at Hamburgh, to the amount of 5000<HI>l.</HI> and upwards. Captain St. Barbe at the &s;ame time &s;hipped linen, groceries, liquors and gla&s;s, on account of him&s;elf and Me&s;&s;rs. Fur&s;t and Co. citizens and burghers of Hamburgh, to the amount, in prime co&s;t, of 901<HI>l.</HI> 8s. 11d. &s;terling.</P>
<P>On or about the 5th of February 1796, Mr. Soren &s;ail|ed in the <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> on his intended voyage. On the 25th of the &s;ame month, being in latitude 44&deg; 1&prime; north, longitude 18&deg; 35&prime; we&s;t, at one <HI>p. m.</HI> Captain St. Barbe and Mr. So|ren ob&s;erved a &s;hip towards the &s;outh-we&s;t, with an Engli&s;h en&s;ign <HI>rever&s;ed,</HI> which they con&s;idered as a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s&punc; they &s;ailed towards her, and about four o'clock <HI>p. m.</HI> came up with her, and learned &s;he was the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> belonging to Me&s;&s;rs.

Tarleton and Backhou&s;e, of Liverpool, Charles Potter com|mander; that &s;he had a letter of marque, and had been freighted by the Briti&s;h Tran&s;port-office to carry nearly 300 troops from Cork to Barbadoes: &s;he was in a very leaky and almo&s;t &s;inking condition, both pumps ince&s;&s;antly going. The Captain, with one of his mates, came on board the <HI>Enterpri&s;e;</HI> and, having &s;hortly informed Captain St. Barbe and Mr. So|ren of the perilous &s;ituation in which he found him&s;elf, re|que&s;ted them to &s;ee him into Li&s;bon or Corunna: Captain St. Barbe replied, that to go to either of tho&s;e places, would be too great a deviation from his voyage; but that, with Mr. Soren's approbation, he would with much plea&s;ure accompany him to Madeira, Teneriffe, or any of the Windward I&s;lands; and render him every &s;ervice in his power, con&s;i&s;tently with the duty he owed to the owners and proprietors of his &s;hip and cargo: Mr. Soren readily a&s;&s;ented. Potter &s;eemed re|joiced at the propo&s;ition, and &s;aid he would &s;end on board his own &s;hip for the approbation of the commander of the troops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Man&s;ergh, now Major Man&s;ergh.</NOTE>: he &s;ent his mate accordingly; but not to communicate to the commander of the troops, or to his crew, the humane offer of Mr. Soren and Mr. St. Barbe! The reader will be &s;tartled at the relation which follows; he will with difficulty con|ceive the po&s;&s;ibility of a tran&s;action &s;o replete with perfidy and ingratitude: it is neverthele&s;s true, and can be e&s;tabli&s;hed be|yond contradiction by the te&s;timony of all the officers of the troops then on board the <HI>I&s;abella</HI> who are now alive: This mon&s;ter in human &s;hape, without a &s;hadow of proof, without the &s;lighte&s;t ground of &s;u&s;picion, without having &s;een a &s;ingle article of the cargo, or a &s;ingle paper, without having had any communication with any one on board but Captain St. Barbe and Mr. Soren, at the very moment when he was expre&s;&s;ing his thanks for their kindne&s;s, which was to re&s;cue him, his pa&s;&s;engers and crew, from almo&s;t inevitable de&s;truction, had conceived the diabolical project of making pri&s;oners of his benefactors, and &s;eizing their &s;hip as a prize! He whi&s;pered to his mate; the mate obeyed the &s;ugge&s;tion: he returned on board the <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; he brought back with him on board the
<PB N="6" REF="038531_0005_10125098AAF8A410">
<HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> a party of &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, with mu&s;quets and bayonets fixed: Potter, on their arrival, in&s;i&s;ted the &s;hip was French; that the cargo con&s;i&s;ted of French and Dutch pro|perty; that the Captain mu&s;t be a Frenchman, becau&s;e his name was "<HI>St. Barbe;</HI>" and that Mr. Soren had two &s;ets of papers! Remon&s;trance was vain: the mi&s;creant took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hip as a prize; made Mr. Soren and the chief mate, the carpenter, and eight of the &s;eamen, pri&s;oners; and drove them, with pi&s;tols cocked at their brea&s;ts, and at the point of the bayonet, out of their own &s;hip into the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> which was every moment in danger of &s;inking!</P>
<P>It was afterwards learned, that Captain Potter, when the <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> approached the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> repre&s;ented to the officers of the King's troops that &s;he was an enemy, and was bear|ing down upon them in order to attack; that the officers, ob|&s;erving her inferior &s;ize, the &s;mall number of men on board, and no appearance of guns or of warlike preparation, rea&s;oned with him again&s;t this repre&s;entation; that, neverthele&s;s, and notwith&s;tanding the perilous condition of his own &s;hip, he or|dered the guns to be got ready, and the &s;oldiers to be arrayed on deck, ready for an attack; and that it was this circum|&s;tance which enabled him, with &s;uch promptitude and facili|ty, to obtain from the officers the party of &s;oldiers who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Enterpri&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. Soren arrived on board the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and &s;tated the circum&s;tances of his &s;ituation, and the manner in which he had been treated by Potter, the officers of the troops, who&s;e humanity and polite attention to the &s;ufferers reflects on them the highe&s;t honour, reprobated in the &s;evere&s;t terms the in|human conduct of Potter; and Captain Man&s;ergh, the com|manding officer, declared, that had he known the real cir|cum&s;tances of the ca&s;e when Potter &s;ent to him for a detach|ment, he would not have permitted it to go.</P>
<P>Potter having, in the manner before &s;tated, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> continued on board her till the following day, when he obliged Captain St. Barbe to deliver up to him, as well the greate&s;t part of the &s;hip's papers, and tho&s;e relating to the cargo, as many others of a private nature: after ex|amining them, he began to rummage the hold; and, after
<PB N="7" REF="038531_0006_1012509B14D5FC00">
breaking open &s;everal ca&s;es and boxes, took out gin, provi&s;ions, and whatever he thought proper, and afterwards gave them to the guard of &s;oldiers, in who&s;e charge he left the &s;hip.</P>
<P>When he returned on board the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> the officers of the troops remon&s;trated with him on the impropriety of his con|duct, and advi&s;ed him to relea&s;e the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> as there was not the &s;lighte&s;t colour for his taking her as prize: he told them that it was no bu&s;ine&s;s of theirs; that they were only pa&s;&s;engers; produced his letter of marque, which, however, only comprehended <HI>French</HI> property; that his owners, Me&s;&s;rs. Tarleton and Backhou&s;e, were per&s;ons of property, and were re&s;pon&s;ible for his conduct; and that, if, through the inter|po&s;ition of the officers, he &s;hould be obliged to part with his prize, they mu&s;t an&s;wer to his owners. In addition to what he had &s;aid the day before, he declared, what was mo&s;t cer|tainly fal&s;e, "that he knew St. Barbe well, that he was a rogue, and that, if he had him in England, he had papers &s;ufficient to hang him."</P>
<P>Mr. Soren repre&s;ented to him, that after the humanity of Mr. St. Barbe, manife&s;ted to him and nearly 300 per&s;ons on board his ve&s;&s;el, his conduct was reprehen&s;ible in the ex|treme; and reque&s;ted, as he was completely in his power, that he might be permitted to return to the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> rather than remain, on board the <HI>I&s;abella:</HI> Potter replied, that Mr. Soren was his pri&s;oner, and that he would conduct the two &s;hips to the Rock of Li&s;bon, and from thence &s;end the <HI>Enter|pri&s;e</HI> to Barbadoes for condemnation. Mr. Soren then repre|&s;ented to him, that he acted in open defiance of the law of na|tions, and in direct violation of the treaty lately concluded between Great Britain and America; and de&s;ired that he would, as he propo&s;ed, direct the &s;hip's cour&s;e to Li&s;bon, where they might both have ample ju&s;tice done to their cau&s;e. Potter then &s;hifted his ground; he pretended that he could not reach Li&s;bon. The officers of the troops de&s;ired that he would &s;teer for Madeira, to which Captain St. Barbe had at fir&s;t offered to accompany him: to this he apparently agreed; but &s;teered to Teneriffe.</P>
<P>When arrived at Teneriffe, Mr. Soren reque&s;ted his per|mi&s;&s;ion to go on &s;hore: the an&s;wer was, "You may jump in|to
<PB N="8" REF="038531_0007_1012509CD56E7EF8">
the &s;ea, if you like it; but neither you nor Captain St. Barbe &s;hall go on &s;hore till the arrival of the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul." That gentleman was then at the Grand Canary. Captain Man&s;ergh interpo&s;ed, and almo&s;t by force took Mr. St. Barbe on &s;hore with him in his boat; they applied to the Governor of Teneriffe, and, by their repre&s;entation, obtained an order for Mr. Soren's being al&s;o permitted to land. In con&s;equence of this order, Mr. Soren, after having been detained upwards of twenty-four hours, landed on Teneriffe, literally a &s;tranger, without money, without friends, &s;tripped of every thing, his gold watch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The watch was afterwards re&s;tored, with five guineas of his money, by the good offices of Captain Man&s;ergh.</NOTE>, his ca&s;h, all his private property, except a few articles of wearing apparel!</P>
<P>In a few days, the Briti&s;h &s;hip <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was condemned, as incapable of proceeding on her voyage. The fact, on inquiry, turns out to be, that this &s;hip was upwards of thirty years old, and, at the time when &s;he was freighted to Government, was unfit to be &s;ent to &s;ea; and had it not been for the continued exertions of the &s;oldiers at the pumps, and, even notwith|&s;tanding tho&s;e exertions, had &s;he met with a &s;evere gale of wind, &s;he mu&s;t have gone to the bottom.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day after the arrival at Teneriffe, Captain Potter began to tran&s;hip from on board the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> on board the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> military &s;tores and baggage, and to un&s;tow the cargo of the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> breaking open &s;ome packages, and &s;tarting others, for the purpo&s;e of &s;itting up births for the ac|commodation of the &s;oldiers, who, to the number of 150, with women and children, be&s;ide the crew of the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> were afterwards embarked on board the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> on which Porter hoi&s;ted the Briti&s;h jack en&s;ign and flag. During the detention of the <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> at Teneriffe, through the wanton|ne&s;s of Potter and his crew, &s;he experienced almo&s;t every &s;pe|cies of injury, and was &s;o much damaged, that when &s;he ar|rived at Barbadoes &s;he was much reduced in value.</P>
<P>While at Teneriffe, application was made by Captain St. Barbe to Peter Favene, E&s;q. the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul there, for an inve&s;tigation of Potter's conduct. That gentleman, though fully &s;atisfied, from the peru&s;al of the documents produced,
<PB N="9" REF="038531_0008_1012509F9B816990">
that there was no foundation for &s;eizing the <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> as a prize, and though he &s;trongly reprobated the conduct of Pot|ter, yet declined to interpo&s;e, from an opinion that, as Con|&s;ul, he had no power to make the required inve&s;tigation; and referred the parties to a regular Court of Admiralty at Barbadoes, whither Potter &s;aid he intended to carry the &s;hip for condemnation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Mr. Favene's Letter to Charles Long, E&s;q. Secretary to the Trea|&s;ury.&mdash;Appendix, No. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the voyage to Teneriffe, Potter, by plying the &s;ailors of the <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> with liquor, and by promi&s;es, endeavoured to prevail on them to give evidence that the <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> was a French or Dutch &s;hip. Finding his atttempts by entreaties ineffectual, he put them on an allowance of bread and wa|ter, and, even of the&s;e, a <HI>&s;canty</HI> allowance. By this treat|ment the health of the mariners was much injured, and more particularly that of the carpenter, who, in addition to other ill-treatment, was kept in irons, as a puni&s;hment for refu&s;ing to &s;wear to the effect Potter wi&s;hed him to do. With two only was he able to &s;ucceed, who afterwards declared they were induced from threats and ill treatment, and that what they had been prevailed upon to depo&s;e was fal&s;e, and extort|ed from them in the hopes of obtaining an alleviation of their &s;ufferings.&mdash;As a proof that his under&s;tanding was as weak as his heart was wicked, he al&s;o attempted to tarni&s;h the honour of the Briti&s;h military, who certainly do not hold in light e&s;timation that delicate point, by promi&s;ing them a &s;hare of the prize, as he termed it, with him; they di&s;dainfully re|fu&s;ed his offer, and expre&s;&s;ed their united di&s;approbation of his conduct in manly and unequivocal terms.</P>
<P>Previous to the departure of the <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> for Barbadoes, Mr. Soren reque&s;ted Potter to permit him to have his private effects, not forming a part of the cargo: he refu&s;ed to re&s;tore a &s;ingle article, except &s;ome private letters of trifling import|ance. He carried his brutality farther: he refu&s;ed Mr. So|ren a pa&s;&s;age to Barbadoes, "unle&s;s he would go in the <HI>com|mon way;</HI>" in other words, "unle&s;s he would go in the &s;teer|age; and he turned Mr. St. Barbe, who, with Mr. Harlow his mate, proceeded to Barbadoes, out of his &s;tate room, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="10" REF="038531_0009_101250A2CB772E40">
the remon&s;trances of the Briti&s;h officers that he ought to be permitted to remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Soren being refu&s;ed a pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> in a decent way, was advi&s;ed by Captains Man&s;ergh and Thomas to leave the conduct of the bu&s;ine&s;s at Barbadoes to Mr. St. Barbe, and to come him&s;elf to England, where it was &s;up|po&s;ed he might obtain redre&s;s for the injuries he had &s;u&s;tain|ed. How far this &s;uppo&s;ition was well-founded, will be &s;een in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>On the 25th of March 1796, Potter &s;ailed in the <HI>Enter|pri&s;e</HI> from Teneriffe, and, on the 16th of April following, arrived in Carli&s;le Bay, Barbadoes. Potter then exhibited a libel again&s;t the &s;hip and cargo, as prize, in the Vice-Admir|alty Court there; to which a claim was entered by Captain St. Barbe, on behalf of him&s;elf and the owner of the &s;hip, and the &s;everal per&s;ons intere&s;ted in her cargo; and a petition was preferred by him to the Judge of the Court, praying that the libellant might be compelled to give &s;ecurity for co&s;ts, in ca&s;e the &s;hip and cargo &s;hould not be condemned as good and law|ful prize. This petition, after argument of coun&s;el, was granted, and Potter not giving &s;ecurity as ordered, the libel was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Proceedings of the Court, Appendix, No. 5, (A.)</NOTE>; on which Mr. St. Barbe petitioned the Court for damages. Potter filed a petition, praying that an attachment might i&s;&s;ue again&s;t the &s;hip and cargo, alleging that &s;ufficient evidence had been obtained to prove them the property of an enemy, until he or the King's Advocate-Ge|neral &s;hould proceed further again&s;t them: this petition being granted, a libel was filed by the King's Advocate-General again&s;t the &s;hip and cargo as a droit of the Admiralty; and this on the very day appointed for the inve&s;tigation of the merits of Captain St. Barbe's petition for damages <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Affidavit of Captain St. Barbe, Appendix, No. 6.</NOTE>. To this libel Captain St. Barbe al&s;o put in his claim on behalf of him&s;elf and the owner of the &s;hip and proprietors of the cargo; and the ca&s;e being heard, the &s;hip and cargo were ordered to be re&s;tored <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Proceedings of the Court, Appendix, No. 5, (B.)</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038531_0010_101250A53095A328">Captain St. Barbe wi&s;hed then to renew his petition for damages; but he was advi&s;ed by his coun&s;el that it would be to no purpo&s;e, as Potter had in the mean time ab&s;conded, and had no property within the reach of the Court, and as the King's Advocate paid no damages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Captain St. Barbe's Affidavit, Appendix, No. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has been &s;tated that Potter had plundered the &s;hip; he had expended a great quantity of the &s;tores; many peri&s;hable articles were completely &s;poiled; the dry goods which remain|ed unplundered, were much damaged; the &s;hip had been robbed of great part of her materials, and was otherwi&s;e much injured; the worm had got into her bottom; and Captain St. Barbe found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to proceed to Alexandria in America, to have her &s;heathed and repaired. When &s;he had undergone &s;uch repairs, which amounted to between 3000<HI>l.</HI> and 4000<HI>l.,</HI> he returned with her to Hamburgh, the place to which &s;he was to have returned after &s;he &s;hould have made her voyage to Surinam.</P>
<P>Before the &s;hip's departure from Barbadoes, the remainder of her cargo, from the depredations of Potter, was &s;old for 2779<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> 0&frac34;<HI>d.</HI>; from which, deducting the expences of &s;ale, amounting to 270<HI>l.</HI> 3<HI>s.</HI> 1&frac12;<HI>d.</HI> there remained the &s;um of 2509<HI>l.</HI> 5<HI>s.</HI> 5&frac14;<HI>d.</HI> Barbadoes currency; in &s;terling money, 1756<HI>l.</HI> 9<HI>s.</HI> 9&frac34;<HI>d.</HI>; a lo&s;s being thus &s;u&s;tained of 2349<HI>l.</HI> 12<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> on the prime co&s;t of the cargo at Hamburgh. The lo&s;s on the whole of this tran&s;action, to Captain St. Barbe and his owner, and to Mr. Soren and his partner, amounted in the whole to 11,553<HI>l.</HI> 19<HI>s.</HI> 8&frac12;<HI>d.</HI> &s;terling <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Statement in the Appendix, No. 7.</NOTE>, independently of the lo&s;s of the voyage, and the probable advantage which might have accrued from it.</P>

&mdash;To the credit of the character of the Briti&s;h merchants, Mr. Soren has been informed by &s;everal Gentlemen at Lloyd's, that he would not have received &s;uch an an&s;wer from the Under|writers at that place.</P>
<P>Mr. Soren was now advi&s;ed to have his ca&s;e drawn up, and &s;ubmitted to the opinion of Coun&s;el. A ca&s;e was ac|cordingly prepared, and laid before Mr. Gibbs, one of His Maje&s;ty's Coun&s;el: In this ca&s;e it was &s;tated, that, on the &s;ailing of a letter of marque, &s;ecurity is given for any damage or injury which may be done to any of His Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, or of foreign &s;tates in amity with His Maje&s;ty; and that, in the ca&s;e of the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> a bond had been given in the penalty of 1500l.&mdash;and the following Query was put:</P>
<P><Q>What &s;teps ought the unfortunate &s;ufferers to pur&s;ue to &s;eek redre&s;s for their &s;everal injuries? Mu&s;t &s;uch redre&s;s be &s;ought by actions at law again&s;t Me&s;&s;rs. Tarleton and Backhou&s;e, the owners of the letter of marque, as Potter, the commander of her, is run away? And will &s;uch actions lie? And in that ca&s;e, and on &s;eparate actions being com|menced, cannot Soren, St. Barbe, and Clough, be evidence for each other, as to the extent of the injuries &s;uffered &s;e|verally? And is the bond for 1500l., given by Jordan, Kembie, and Sowerby, a&s;&s;ignable for the benefit of the &s;ufferers? And, ought an application to be made to the Lords of the Admiralty in this ca&s;e, or whom el&s;e, by pe|tition or otherwi&s;e, to direct the &s;ame to be put in &s;uit? And, upon the whole, point out what &s;teps they ought to take to &s;eek effectual redre&s;s; and, if actions are maintain|able, what evidence will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport &s;uch actions.</Q></P>

<DIV1 TYPE="opinion">
<P>The application of the parties in this ca&s;e ought to have been to the Court of Vice-Admiralty for co&s;ts and damages, it being the proper duty of that Court, not only to make re&s;titution where it is due, but likewi&s;e to decree co&s;ts and damages when the capture was gro&s;sly improper. If the Judge refu&s;e improperly to decree co&s;ts and damages, an appeal lies from that refu&s;al; but I do not think that any common law juri&s;diction either can or will examine the que&s;tion whether the capture was unju&s;t or not: it is a que&s;tion merely of Admiralty cognizance; and if the Court of Admiralty or Court of Appeals has not decreed it to be an illegal &s;eizure, a Court of Common Law will not take upon it&s;elf to pronounce &s;uch a judgment. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that a decree of re&s;titution does by no means infer that the original &s;eizure was illegal and violent; for there may be ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;eizure, although the property may, upon further inquiry, be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>I am of opinion that the decree, &s;tanding as it does, unaccompanied with co&s;ts and damages, mu&s;t be taken <HI>in all Courts</HI> to imply that co&s;ts and damages were not due; and this imputation is the &s;tronger again&s;t the claimants for their not demanding them; for, if they did not demand co&s;ts and damages in the proper juri&s;diction in which they ought to be awarded, the inference would be, not only that co&s;ts and damages were not due, but that they were not due <HI>in the opinion of the claimants them&s;elves,</HI> who did not &s;o much as venture to a&s;k them.&mdash;Upon the&s;e grounds, I am

<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e opinions, Mr. Soren was advi&s;ed to lay his ca&s;e in the form of a petition before his Maje&s;ty in Council, A petition was accordingly prepared<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Appendix, No. 8.</NOTE>, and &s;ent to Lord Grenville, inclo&s;ed in a letter from Mr. King<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Appendix, No. 9.</NOTE>, the American Mini&s;ter: his Lord&s;hip laid it before the Privy Council, who con&s;idered the ca&s;e as a ca&s;e of peculiar hard|&s;hip, and that Mr. Soren was well entitled to &s;ome compen|&s;ation for his lo&s;s; but they were of opinion that the applica|tion ought to have been made to the Lords of the Trea&s;ury. This being communicated to Mr. Soren, he prepared another petition to the &s;ame effect, and, through the medium of Mr. King, procured it to be laid before the latter Board: he was con&s;tant in his attendance every Board-day for &s;ix months; at the expiration of which time, the ca&s;e was referred by the Lords of the Trea&s;ury to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Tran&s;port-Office, who made a mo&s;t extraordinary report to Charles Long, E&s;q. of the Trea&s;ury:
<Q>That the &s;hip called the <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI> was not a <HI>regular</HI> tran&s;port in the &s;ervice of Govern|ment, but only <HI>freighted</HI> by them to carry troops to Bar|badoes; and that, therefore, their department, or their agents, were not re&s;pon&s;ible, but the ma&s;ter of the <HI>I&s;abella</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Lord Grenville's letter to Mr. King, Appendix, No. 10.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is difficult to comprehend how the di&s;tinction between "a <HI>regular</HI> tran&s;port in the <HI>&s;ervice</HI> of Government," and
"a &s;hip only <HI>freighted</HI> by them to carry troops,"
could affect the claim of Mr. Soren, or of the ma&s;ter or the owner of the <HI>En|terpri&s;e,</HI> on the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of Government for a compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained by means of the iniquitous con|duct of a man certainly in the <HI>&s;ervice</HI> of Government; or the right of the <HI>owner</HI> of the <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> to the proportion of <HI>freight,</HI> at <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> for the conveyance of the troops from Tene|riffe to Barbadoes.</P>

<P>In the month of September 1798, Mr. Soren was ad|vi&s;ed to make another application to Lord Grenville indivi|dually, reque&s;ting his Lord&s;hip's interpo&s;ition in his favour: this he did in a letter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Mr. Soren's letter to Lord Grenville, Appendix, No. 12.</NOTE> which he procured to be delivered to his Lord&s;hip through the medium of Mr. King. What &s;tep was taken by his Lord&s;hip in con&s;equence of this applica|tion, he could not learn, till after an attendance of &s;everal months on his Lord&s;hip's Secretary, Mr. Hammond, by whom he was at la&s;t informed, that his Lord&s;hip had written on the &s;ubject to the Right Hon. Henry Dundas, who was then in the country, and for who&s;e return Mr. Soren was under the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting till the month of March 1799.</P>
<P>In the month of October 1798, Mr. Soren being informed that Me&s;&s;rs. Tarleton and Backhou&s;e were men of great pro|perty, was advi&s;ed to go down to Liverpool, and make per&s;onal application to them for &s;ome relief; and, having, as before &s;tated, been informed that they had received from Govern|ment the freight of the troops to Barbadoes, to a&s;certain whe|ther he could, by any means, or in any &s;hape, proceed again&s;t them in ca&s;e of their refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival at Liverpool, he had an interview with Mr. Backhou&s;e, who &s;eemed to pity his ca&s;e, and di&s;|po&s;ed to do &s;omething for him: he reprobated the conduct of Potter in merited terms, and &s;aid "he wi&s;hed he had hold of him for Mr. Soren's &s;ake;" but at the &s;ame time he inform|ed him that Mr. Tarleton was out of town, and that nothing could be done without his pre&s;ence and con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mr. John Tarleton arrived, and Mr. Soren waited on
<PB N="17" REF="038531_0016_101250B365087FD0">
him; but what was his &s;urpri&s;e when he found that Mr. Tarleton attempted to ju&s;tify the conduct of Potter; &s;aid he was perfectly right, and in&s;i&s;ted that Mr. Soren was loaded with enemies' property!</P>
<P>In what terms can the conduct of that man be adequately reprehended, who could ju&s;tify a mi&s;creant who had committed a piracy which di&s;graces humanity?&mdash;Mr. Soren pities Mr. John Tarleton, and would not exchange &s;ituations with him, were his fortune ten times what it is; and, with this ob&s;er|vation, let Mr. John Tarleton be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ional men at Liverpool, Mr. Soren entertained &s;ome hope, that all legal redre&s;s again&s;t Me&s;&s;rs. Tarleton and Backhou&s;e was not ab&s;o|lutely &s;hut again&s;t him: he therefore laid his ca&s;e, with &s;ome additional circum&s;tances and ob&s;ervations, before Mr. Park, who con&s;idered it as a ca&s;e of much compa&s;&s;ion; but his opi|nion was equally unfavourable to Mr. Soren's claim to <HI>legal</HI> redre&s;s with tho&s;e which had preceded it.</P>
<P>Mr. Park's opinion was in the following words:</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="opinion">
<P>I have peru&s;ed all the papers laid before me with con&s;i|derable attention; and although I think it a ca&s;e of unpa|ralleled hard&s;hip, and infamous mi&s;conduct, yet I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that as the&s;e proceedings have taken place <HI>under colour of prize,</HI> and as a Court of Admiralty has already taken cognizance of, and come to an adjudication upon, the principal matter, I am of opinion the mi&s;conduct of the Captain, either by an action again&s;t him or his owners, is not now triable in Great Britain in a Court of <HI>municipal law.</HI> I am aware that Mr. Soren was not per&s;onally pre|&s;ent, to lay his claim before the Vice-Admiralty Court of Barbadoes: but I think that makes no difference; for, in contemplation of the law of England, the &s;entence of a Court of Admiralty binds every man; and the Captain, though not &s;pecially &s;o con&s;tituted, was the agent of all parties as to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o attentively read the ca&s;e of Le Caux <HI>v.</HI> Eden, referred to in the opinion given by Mr. Gibbs; and I am clearly of opinion, that although the circum&s;tances of that ca&s;e are very different from, and not to be compared in
<PB N="18" REF="038531_0017_101250B75F9FBFB8">
enormity with, tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent, the principle of that de|ci&s;ion, and of others therein cited, applies mo&s;t &s;trongly to the pre&s;ent. The general principle there e&s;tabli&s;hed, as well as in Rous <HI>v.</HI> Ha&s;&s;ard, and in Living&s;ton <HI>v.</HI> Welch, is, that although an action of tre&s;pa&s;s would lie for <HI>taking a &s;hip or goods,</HI> or impri&s;oning, or otherwi&s;e cruelly treating a man on the <HI>high &s;eas</HI>; yet, when it is taken as prize, though taken wrongfully, though it be re&s;tored, though there be no colour for the taking (as here), the Judge of the Ad|miralty mu&s;t judge of all the aggravation and con&s;equences, as well as of the principal matter; and if an action were brought in a Court of common law in England, the plain|tiff could not recover.</P>
<P>What redre&s;s Mr. Soren can obtain in a Court of Ad|miralty in the pre&s;ent &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, he has already been informed by men very competent to advi&s;e him; and I fear he can have no other remedy than by an application to the favour of the Briti&s;h Government, who&s;e &s;ubject has behaved in a mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive, wicked, and inhuman manner.</P>

<P>Sir William returned the following an&s;wer:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am honoured with your Lord&s;hip's letter, dated Sep|tember 21, inclo&s;ing the copy of a letter received from Mr. Soren, and de&s;iring me to report to your Lord&s;hip the cir|cum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, and the grounds on which legal re|dre&s;s is rendered impo&s;&s;ible. In obedience to your Lord|&s;hip's reque&s;t, I have con&s;idered the &s;ame; and report to your Lord&s;hip, that the &s;hip <HI>Enterpri&s;e,</HI> belonging to Mr. Soren, an American &s;ubject, was taken and carried into Barbadoes by the Briti&s;h letter of marque &s;hip <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> in a
<PB N="19" REF="038531_0018_101250B8FA326060">
manner, as Mr. Soren has uniformly repre&s;ented it, very incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and good faith. That proceedings were commenced in the Vice-Admiralty Court of that i&s;land, by the decree of which the ve&s;&s;el was finally liber|ated; but, that no co&s;ts and damages were awarded&mdash;none having been proved on the part of the owner. That all avenue to legal redre&s;s is irrevocably clo&s;ed, by this omi&s;&s;ion on the part of the owner, or his agent; for, that a &s;imple re&s;titution having been accepted in the Court below, the proceedings there were completely fini&s;hed, and cannot be revived by a new demand for co&s;ts and damages, which had never been urged in the original cau&s;e: and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, no &s;uch demand can be addre&s;&s;ed to the Court of Appeals; the &s;entence having been accepted by the owner or his agent in an unqualified manner, and without any ul|terior demand, from the rejection of which he might legally have appealed. And as to a Court of common law, to which he was advi&s;ed to re&s;ort, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that that Court has no juri&s;diction upon &s;ubjects of this na|ture; but that the matter of prize, with all its con&s;e|quences, as well of co&s;ts and damages, as of every other &s;pe|cies, belongs, altogether and exclu&s;ively, to the Courts of Admiralty.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will, therefore, be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that the hard&s;hip of this ca&s;e, whatever may be its extent, ari&s;es entirely from the neglect of the owner or his agent; which Mr. Soren ju&s;tifies or excu&s;es, by imputing it to ill advice admini&s;tered in the i&s;land. One certain hard&s;hip I have already pointed out to be the entire lo&s;s of legal redre&s;s; and with re&s;pect to redre&s;s of an equitable nature, it is not perhaps too har&s;h to remark, that if a country provides Courts of Ju&s;tice and a regular cour&s;e of legal proceedings for the reparation of wrongs done by its &s;ubjects to the &s;ub|jects of foreign powers, it has done all that the intercour&s;e of nations requires; and that the dereliction of &s;uch legal remedies, under the plea of private ill advice which the par|ties have received to that effect, has not been held, as far as I know, to found a demand upon the equity of the public Government of the country. It is, however, due to the
<PB N="20" REF="038531_0019_101250BB62CF9348">
claimant to remark, that he has, in his pre&s;ent application, &s;tated a public &s;ervice of con&s;iderable merit towards the King's Government, in the conveyance of His Maje&s;ty's forces, on board his ve&s;&s;el, to the i&s;land of Barbadoes, when the <HI>I&s;abella</HI> tran&s;port was incapable of conveying them; and I &s;ubmit to your Lord&s;hip's judgment, how far the proof of &s;uch a fact, aided by &s;uch circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e as addre&s;s them&s;elves to compa&s;&s;ion, may entitle the party to be favourably con&s;idered by his Maje&s;ty's Government.</P>

<P>What report the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Tran&s;port-office made in con&s;equence of Mr. Dundas's recommendation of the ca&s;e to their con&s;ideration, Mr. Soren has not learned; but he was informed at that office, that it was the opinion of &s;ome per&s;ons there that the Lords of the Trea&s;ury ought to cau&s;e to be paid to him, the amount of the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained on his cargo, as well as the freight for the conveyance of the troops. He renewed his attendance at the Trea&s;ury, and continued it every Board-day till the month of July following, when he was informed by Mr. Long, that the Lords of the Trea&s;ury had directed the Tran&s;port-office to pay him 500l. This ra|ther &s;urpri&s;ed him, as Me&s;&s;rs. Tarleton and Backhou&s;e had paid for the conveyance of about 60 of the troops in the <HI>Te|neriffe Packet</HI> the &s;um of 1500l. and at that rate the convey|ance of the remaining 150 in the <HI>Enterprize</HI> would amount to 3750l. Mr. Soren, therefore, took the liberty of remon|&s;trating
<PB N="22" REF="038531_0021_101250C07B751990">
with Mr. Long on the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;um, when that gentleman a&s;&s;ured him that was the whole that was or|dered him, and intimated, that unle&s;s he accepted the &s;um then offered, he had to expect nothing. The difficulties in which Mr. Soren had been involved, from the total ruin of his fortune, and the di&s;appointment of the very flattering pro|&s;pects he had rea&s;onably formed from the event of his voy|age, the di&s;tre&s;s he had &s;uffered from the great length of time which had clap&s;ed from the period when his &s;hip was &s;eized, and the dread that Mr. Long's intimation might be realized, induced him to accept the proffered &s;um; and it &s;eems he has but &s;mall foundation to hope for any further compen&s;ation for his lo&s;s, and the injury he has &s;u&s;tained, unle&s;s the preceding &s;imple narrative of his ca&s;e &s;hould happen to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the eye of tho&s;e members of Admini&s;tration who appear to have formed a ju&s;t e&s;timation of the gro&s;s inju&s;tice of the capture, and the unparalleled circum&s;tances of wickedne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion with which it was accompanied.</P>
<P>The objection to Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> claim of compen&s;ation is, that he has let pa&s;s the proper time for making that claim.&mdash; It is certainly true that a Court of Admiralty has the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction of the que&s;tion, "<HI>Prize or no prize?</HI>" and that, having cognizance of the <HI>principal</HI> que&s;tion, it has al&s;o the power, and the <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> power, of awarding co&s;ts and damages to the full extent, to the captured, where the cir|cum&s;tances of the ca&s;e warrant &s;uch a decree. It mu&s;t be ad|mitted, that a decree of re&s;titution by no means implies that the captured are entitled, as a matter of cour&s;e, to a decree of co&s;ts and damages: there may have been <HI>probable</HI> grounds of &s;eizure, though, on a full inve&s;tigation, the &s;hip and cargo &s;eized may be ju&s;tly re&s;tored. It mu&s;t al&s;o be admitted, that where the parties libelled, omit, in the proper &s;tage of the pro|ceedings, to pray for co&s;ts and damages, the fair inference, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance is, that they are &s;atisfied their ca&s;e does not entitle them to demand them: and it cannot be denied, that, in a legal point of view, Mr. St. Barbe was Mr. Soren's agent, though not &s;pecially con&s;tituted &s;uch; and that Mr. Soren was, in the &s;ame point of view, bound by his acts or omi&s;&s;ions; but neither can it be denied, that a man may
<PB N="23" REF="038531_0022_101250C21BBB9FE8">
&s;uffer great inju&s;tice, and &s;u&s;tain mo&s;t grievous hard&s;hips, from the default of his agent, without being ju&s;tly charged with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the want of merit in his cau&s;e, and that he may, by accident or misfortune, or by the artful ma|nagement of his opponent, be completely &s;hut out from <HI>legal</HI> redre&s;s, without forfeiting his claim to compen&s;ation from that Government, by the nefarious acts of who&s;e <HI>&s;ervant</HI> he has been reduced to ruin.</P>
<P>This is <HI>peculiarly</HI> the ca&s;e of Mr. Soren: he exerci&s;ed an act of the mo&s;t benevolent nature towards a &s;hip in di&s;tre&s;s, in the danger of every moment going to the bottom of the ocean; this &s;hip, and its commander, were in the <HI>&s;ervice</HI> of the Government of Great Britain: he received a mo&s;t un|grateful requital; his &s;hip and cargo were &s;eized as prize, without the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;hadow of a cau&s;e; he was cruelly put in a &s;ituation which prevented him, but under the mo&s;t mortifying circum&s;tances, from following his property to the place where he might in per&s;on have claimed the protection and ju&s;tice of the proper juri&s;diction. There does not even &s;eem to have been any cen&s;urable default in his agent. Mr. St. Barbe did, in fact, in the proper &s;tage of the proceeding, petition for co&s;ts and damages; this was rendered nugatory by the management of Potter, who procured the &s;hip and cargo to be libelled as a droit of Admiralty at the &s;uit of the King's advocate, on the very day when his petition was to be taken into con&s;ideration. Before the &s;econd libel could be di&s;po&s;ed of, Potter, again&s;t whom alone the decree of co&s;ts and damages could be pronounced, ab&s;conded, leaving no pro|perty again&s;t which &s;uch a decree could attach: the King's Advocate pays no co&s;ts or damages: in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e he acted merely in an official capacity, on the &s;ugge&s;tion of Pot|ter: it is therefore to be attributed to accident, or at the mo&s;t an excu&s;able want of fore&s;ight on the part of Mr. St Barbe or his advi&s;ers, or to the guilty management of Potter, that the proper time for demanding legal redre&s;s has pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Had the <HI>Enterpri&s;e</HI> been captured by a per&s;on armed with a mere letter of marque, or even by a King's &s;hip in the or|dinary cour&s;e of warfare on the &s;eas, without the circum&s;tance of her having fallen into the &s;nare by an act of benevolence
<PB N="24" REF="038531_0023_101250C497643860">
on the part of her commander and &s;upercargo; though there had been no <HI>colour</HI> for the capture, though there had been no circum&s;tance of &s;u&s;picion to <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> the capture, though there had been a decree of re&s;titution on the fulle&s;t and cleare&s;t evi|dence that &s;he was not a fit &s;ubject of &s;eizure, though it mu&s;t have been manife&s;t to all the world, that if a petition for co&s;ts and damages had been preferred, it mu&s;t have been decreed; yet if the parties intere&s;ted had, in the proper &s;tage of the pro|ceedings, through ignorance, or accident, or ill advice, or any other cau&s;e, omitted to claim tho&s;e co&s;ts and damages, it is not contended that there would have been any moral obligation on the Government, under the &s;anction of who&s;e flag the injury had been committed, to refund the injured party the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it is not contended that Government were bound, by any rule of &s;trict moral obligation, to com|pen&s;ate Mr. Soren for any di&s;appointment in his expectation of <HI>&s;peculative</HI> gain on the event of his voyage; but, on an at|tentive peru&s;al of his ca&s;e, it is hardly to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the impartial reader will think it unrea&s;onable or too &s;anguine in him to have hoped that he would have been reimbur&s;ed the difference between the prime co&s;t of his cargo and the produce of the remains which e&s;caped the hands of his plundering captor, together with the full freight for the troops conveyed in his &s;hip from Teneriffe to Barbadoes. His right to the <HI>latter</HI> can hardly be di&s;puted on &s;trict <HI>legal</HI> principles; though, perhaps, he might not be able, in any form of action, to re|cover again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Tran&s;ports, becau&s;e he had no contract with them. This right mu&s;t indeed be con|&s;idered as acknowledged by tho&s;e who ordered the payment of the 500<HI>l.</HI>; for it &s;eems to have been ordered, not as an of|fering of genero&s;ity in compa&s;&s;ion to the hard&s;hips of his ca&s;e, but as an equivalent for the freight of the troops: it was, in fact, by no means an equivalent according to the u&s;ual rate in &s;uch ca&s;es. By what hidden influence &s;o &s;mall a &s;um was ordered, it is difficult to conjecture: it is manife&s;t, from the letters of Lord Grenville and Mr. Dundas, that it was the wi&s;h of both tho&s;e mini&s;ters that Mr. Soren &s;hould have an ample compen&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="038531_0024_101250C70760F250">The contra&s;t between Mr. Soren's pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and what it might have been, had he been fortunate enough not to have fallen in with the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> is mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. From Hamburgh he failed with a cargo, the prime co&s;t of which ex|ceeded 3000<HI>l.</HI>: it con&s;i&s;ted of articles which would have been of high value in the place to which they were de&s;tined; the pro|fits would have been large; the produce was to have been laid out in the purcha&s;e of an article which might probably have been &s;old at Hamburgh at double the original price; and to this was to be added the profit ari&s;ing from &s;o much more of the &s;ame article as could have been purcha&s;ed at Su|rinam for 15,000<HI>l.</HI>; for to that extent Mr. Soren had letters of credit on that place: the whole profits of his voyage mu&s;t have placed him in a &s;tate of enviable independence. He is now &s;tripped of every thing; he has wa&s;ted four years of the prime of life in fruitle&s;s &s;olicitation; he has again to begin his career of indu&s;try, with a wife and three infant children, without the aid of capital, though not perhaps without friends. His ca&s;e is re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted to the attentive peru&s;al of the Public, but more particularly of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ituation in life, or the &s;ituation of who&s;e friends and relatives, may po&s;|&s;ibly expo&s;e them to the &s;ame kind of di&s;tre&s;s which he has experienced.</P>

<HEAD>No. I. Copy of Charter-party.</HEAD>
<P>BY this pre&s;ent charter-party be it known unto whom it may concern, that on Tue&s;day the 24th day of November, in the year of our Lord 1795, before me, Charles Conrad Frederic Hartman, notary-public by Imperial authority law|fully admitted and &s;worn, dwelling and practi&s;ing in the free imperial city of Hamburgh, per&s;onally came and appeared Me&s;&s;rs. Holyoke and Soren, of Bo&s;ton, but now of this city, merchants, affreighters, of the one part, and Captain Wyatt St. Barbe, ma&s;ter or commander of the American &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el called the Enterpri&s;e, of the burden of 170 la&s;ts, or there|abouts, letter, of the other part; who declared, that by the interpo&s;ition of Mr. Peter Sprinkhorn, of Hamburgh, &s;worn &s;hip's-broker, they had covenanted and agreed on the freight|ing and letting the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el for a voyage from hence to Surinam and back to this port, on the terms as follow; that is to &s;ay:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="28" REF="038531_0026_101250CC9E924758">1&s;t, Captain Wyatt St. Barbe is obliged to proceed, with|in thirty days, from hence, either in balla&s;tor with permitted goods, to Surinam, and there to let and deliver his &s;aid &s;hip tight and &s;taunch, well caulked, tackled, apparelled, manned, and provided with every thing el&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for the perform|ing of the &s;aid loading and voyage, as al&s;o with the proper &s;hip's papers, to the &s;ole u&s;e and free di&s;po&s;ition of the freighters, (the proper place for putting in the &s;ails, cables and provi&s;ions, as al&s;o the nece&s;&s;ary room for the crew, ex|cepted, as being for the &s;hip's u&s;e,) he not being permitted to load any goods or merchandizes for whom&s;oever, without the con&s;ent of the freighters, on pain of forfeiting the freight-money agreed upon for &s;uch goods, except three tons per hundred, which the captain may have on board for his own account, according to the cu&s;tom of America.</P>
<P N="2">2d, The freighter's promi&s;e to cau&s;e to be &s;hipped on board the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el, on her &s;afe arrival at Surinam afore|&s;aid, a full convenient cargo of We&s;t Indian products; but the captain is allowed three tons per hundred, as he is privi|leged according to the cu&s;tom of America; with which cargo the captain, as &s;oon as he &s;hall be di&s;patched by the &s;hippers, is to depart immediately, wind and weather permitting it, and to proceed on his voyage directly to this port of Ham|burgh.</P>
<P N="3">3d, On the &s;hip's &s;afe arrival at the unloading place, and the captain having well and faithfully delivered the cargo ac|cording to the bills of lading by him &s;igned, (&s;ave that he &s;hall not be an&s;werable for the ri&s;ks and damages of the &s;ea,) the freighters are obliged to cau&s;e to be paid unto the &s;aid captain, or to his order, exactly, and without exception, his freight-money, &s;tipulated at the rate of two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred pounds &s;terling, good and lawful money of Great Britain, with fifteen per cent. primage for the whole &s;hip's hold, and the performance of both voyages. On account of which freight, the captain is to be furni&s;hed at Surinam with what money he may be in need of, the extraordinary average which
<PB N="29" REF="038531_0027_101250D0261ECA00">
might happen on this intended voyage being to be regulated and paid according to the cu&s;tom of the &s;ea.</P>
<P N="4">4th, For loading at Surinam, forty running days, and for delivering here, thirty running days, in all, are agreed, be|ginning at Surinam afore&s;aid as &s;oon as the captain &s;hall have adverti&s;ed the &s;hipper of his &s;hip's being ready to receive the cargo on board, and continuing here the day after the &s;aid &s;hip's being reported at the Cu&s;tomhou&s;e, and the captain's having informed the con&s;ignees of the cargo of his being pre|pared to deliver the &s;ame. If detained longer, the freighters are to pay him &s;ix pounds lawful Briti&s;h &s;terling money de|murrage, for every day &s;o detained, day by day, as it becomes due.</P>
<P N="5">5th, The freighters cau&s;e the cargo to be &s;hipped on board, and &s;o likewi&s;e landed, free of any expences to the captain, provided his &s;hip be moored at proper places, &s;o as the depth of the water will permit it; but the captain is obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t with his boats and people in taking in the cargo at Surinam afore&s;aid.</P>
<P N="6">6th, The Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e duties for the cargo &s;hall be cleared by the freighters, and tho&s;e for the &s;hip by the cap|tain&punc;</P>
<P N="7">7th, In ca&s;e the &s;hip &s;hould happen to be lo&s;t on her homeward pa&s;&s;age, which God forbid, the freighters are bound to pay for the outward voyage to Mr. St. Barbe, or Me&s;&s;rs. Pari&s;h and Co. his corre&s;pondents here, one thou&s;and two hundred pounds &s;terling, good and lawful money of Great Britain, with fifteen per cent. primage, after deducting the money which the captain may have received at Surinam as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>And for the true performance of all and &s;ingular the above covenants and agreements, the &s;aid parties do hereby mutually bind them&s;elves, e&s;pecially the freighters engaging the &s;aid

<HEAD>No. IV. Letter from <HI>PETER FAVENC,</HI> Con&s;ul-General for the Canary I&s;lands, to <HI>CHARLES LONG,</HI> E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The motive of troubling you with this letter is at the re|que&s;t of Mr. Soren, relative to a tran&s;action that took place in the year 1796. In the month of March, in the &s;aid year, arrived in Santa Cruz, in the i&s;land of Teneriffe, an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, commanded by a man of the name of Charles Potter; &s;he was from Cork, with troops on board, bound to the i&s;land of Barbadoes. On her arrival, through the channel of one of my agents, the &s;aid Potter applied to me for my advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as his ve&s;&s;el was very leaky, and totally unfit to pro|ceed on her voyage; indeed, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, had he not had the good fortune to fall in with the American &s;hip, the Enterprize, bound from Hamburgh to the i&s;land of De|marara, he would, in all probability, never have reached Te|neriffe, or any other port. Happening at that period to be in the i&s;land of Grand Canary, with &s;ome friends, I immediate|ly came over to aid him in the be&s;t manner I was able. He &s;tated to me the &s;ervice Captain St. Barbe and Mr. Soren had rendered him, in bearing down when he hoi&s;ted &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s; but, waving the gratitude he &s;hould have felt for what in all probability was the pre&s;ervation of his life, and of tho&s;e entru&s;ted to his care, he proclaimed the American &s;hip a lawful prize, having naval &s;tores on board, and being bound to an enemy's port: Of this I had great doubt, from the documents he produced; and from the event I am ju&s;ti|fied. He was pre&s;&s;ing with me to condemn her; but this I could not, it not laying &s;olely in my brea&s;t&mdash;I advi&s;ed him carrying her down to &s;ome i&s;land where there was a regular Court of Admiralty e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>His own ve&s;&s;el, the I&s;abella, having been condemned and &s;old, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him, the &s;aid Potter, to devi&s;e &s;ome plan for the conveying the&s;e troops to their de&s;tination. As
<PB N="34" REF="038531_0032_101250DB5C7E8E40">
many as he could, he put on board the Enterpri&s;e; and hav|ing freighted a brig called the Teneriffe Packet, he in the&s;e two ve&s;&s;els conveyed the troops, which all arrived &s;afe, and without the lea&s;t accident. In regard to Potter's conduct, I think it was totally unju&s;tifiable, with re&s;pect to Mr. Soren, Captain St. Barbe, and the proprietors of the goods on board the Enterpri&s;e, he having acted towards them with the greate&s;t ingratitude; and not having it in his power to make them the proper retribution, I think, from the &s;ervice the country has received in the&s;e troops being &s;o &s;oon forwarded to Barbadoes, to which place much time would have elap&s;ed before their ar|rival, had the Enterpri&s;e not been &s;eized upon in the very cruel manner &s;he was, &s;ome adequate compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the parties intere&s;ted ought to be made: but this it does not become me to point out; to &s;uperior judgment I leave that.</P>
<P>If it would not be inconvenient to you, Sir, or intruding too much on your time, I &s;hould feel my&s;elf honoured in half an hour's conver&s;ation with you on the &s;ubject of Me&s;&s;rs. Tarleton and Backhou&s;e, of Liverpool, who&s;e conduct, in &s;ome part of this tran&s;action, I think, &s;hould be condemned.</P>

<OPENER>To the <HI>KING'S</HI> Mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty in Council, The Humble Petition of <HI>JOHN SOREN,</HI> of Bo&s;ton, in North America, merchant, partner in the hou&s;e of Holyoke and So|ren, of Bo&s;ton afore&s;aid, and <HI>WYATT ST. BARBE,</HI> captain of the American &s;hip Enterpri&s;e, belonging to Clough, of Witchca&s;&s;et, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, in North America afore&s;aid, SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>That your petitioners entered into a charter-party, or agree|ment together, bearing date at Hamburgh the 24th of No|vember 1795, whereby it was agreed that your Petitioner, Captain Wyatt St. Barbe, &s;hould proceed from Hamburgh afore&s;aid, with the &s;aid &s;hip, either in balla&s;t or permitted goods, to Surinam; and your Petitioner, John Soren, agreed to &s;hip on board the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el, at Surinam afore&s;aid, a full cargo of We&s;t India products, on the terms therein men|tioned.</P>
<P>That your Petitioner, John Soren, &s;hipped a cargo on the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el, con&s;i&s;ting of linen, chee&s;e, bacon, and other goods, which he purcha&s;ed at Hamburgh, for the &s;um of 3204<HI>l.</HI> 3<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> of &s;terling money of Great Britain; and your petiti|oner, Wyatt St. Barbe, al&s;o &s;hipped a quantity of linen, gro|ceries, liquors, and gla&s;s, on account of him&s;elf and Me&s;&s;rs. Fur&s;t and Co. citizens and burghers of Hamburgh, to the value of 901<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> 11<HI>d.</HI> of like &s;terling money.</P>
<P>That your Petitioners &s;et &s;ail in the &s;aid &s;hip, on the 5th day of February 1796, from Hamburgh, to Surinam, there to di&s;po&s;e of their &s;aid cargo; and your Petitioner, John So|ren, al&s;o intended to take in another cargo of coffee at Suri|nam, upon his own account.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="038531_0038_101250E88AEDDA00">That your Petitioners, on the 25th day of February 1796, the &s;aid &s;hip Enterpri&s;e being in latitude 44&deg; 1&prime; N. and lon|gitude 18&deg; 35&prime; W. on her &s;aid voyage, di&s;covered a &s;hip with an Engli&s;h en&s;ign rever&s;ed, hoi&s;ted as a &s;ignal of di&s;|tre&s;s: Your Petitioners, therefore, immediately made &s;ail for her, and came up with and &s;poke her, and found her to be a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el, called the I&s;abella letter of marque, belonging to Me&s;&s;rs. Tarleton and Backhou&s;e, of the port of Liverpool commanded by Captain Charles Potter, and chartered as a tran&s;port-&s;hip by the Briti&s;h Government, and was then on a voyage from Cork to the i&s;land of Barbadoes, with a con&s;ider|able number of your Maje&s;ty's troops on board. Your Peti|tioners found her in a very leaky and di&s;abled condition, and in great di&s;tre&s;s and danger, and both pumps going ince&s;&s;antly. Captain Potter, of the I&s;abella, came on board your Petition|er's ve&s;&s;el, and, after repre&s;enting to your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, the extreme perilous &s;ituation of his &s;hip and com|pany, entreated your &s;aid Petitioner to accompany him, and &s;ee him &s;afe into Li&s;bon or Corunna; in an&s;wer to which, your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, ob&s;erved, that having freighted his own &s;hip, the Enterpri&s;e, for Surinam, his going with her to Li&s;bon or Corunna would be &s;o great a deviation from his own voyage, that it would be thereby de&s;troyed; but that, on account of the very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the I&s;abella and her crew, he would accompany them to Madeira, Te|neriffe, or any of the Windward I&s;lands, and would accom|modate the officers and as many of your Maje&s;ty's troops as he could in his own ve&s;&s;el, and would al&s;o render every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power. To all which your Petitioner John Soren al&s;o mo&s;t readily gave his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>That Captain Potter appeared to your Petitioners to be very well plea&s;ed and &s;atisfied with the humane offer of your Petitioners, and &s;aid he would immediately &s;end on board his own ve&s;&s;el for the approbation of the colonel and other offi|cers of your Maje&s;ty's troops. He accordingly &s;ent his own mate, who had come on board your Petitioner's &s;hip along with him, to his own ve&s;&s;el, in order to communicate, as your
<PB N="41" REF="038531_0039_101250EAF23CD318">
Petitioners under&s;tood, the very obliging offer made by your Petitioners, as before-mentioned: but, in&s;tead of this, with an ingratitude and treachery &s;carcely to be paralleled, he de&s;ired his mate to bring along with him a party of the &s;hip I&s;abella's armed force, for the purpo&s;e of capturing your Petitioner's &s;aid &s;hip, the Enterpri&s;e, notwith&s;tanding &s;he belonged to, and was freighted and commanded by, the citizens of the United States of America, a country at peace with your Maje&s;ty, had nothing but neutral goods on board, purcha&s;ed at Hamburgh for &s;ale at Surinam afore&s;aid, notwith&s;tanding the offers made by your Petitioners to Captain Potter, to &s;ee the I&s;abella and her company &s;afe at Madeira or Teneriffe, or any of the Windward I&s;lands, as afore&s;aid, and notwith&s;tanding your Petitioners had &s;ailed a con&s;iderable way out of their own track for the purpo&s;e of &s;aving the &s;aid &s;hip I&s;abella from being lo&s;t, which in all probability would have happened but for the timely interference of your Petitioners.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid mate returned with a party of armed &s;oldiers and &s;ailors from the I&s;abella, and &s;eized your Petitioner's &s;aid &s;hip and cargo as a prize, and made your Petitioners and the crew pri&s;oners, and forced your Petitioner, John Soren, with the chief mate and crew, out of their own &s;hip into a boat, and put them on board the I&s;abella, though &s;he was &s;till in the mo&s;t dangerous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition, as if for the very purpo&s;e of &s;acrificing them to that fate from which your Petitioners had &s;aved them.</P>
<P>That when your Petitioner John Soren arrived on board the I&s;abella, he &s;tated the circum&s;tances to the officers of your Maje&s;ty's troops on board, and they reprobated, in the &s;trong|e&s;t terms, the &s;hocking and inhumane conduct of Captain Potter.</P>
<P>That Captain Potter obliged your Petitioner Captain St. Barbe to give him up all his papers, and broke open &s;everal ca&s;es and boxes, and took thereout part of the cargo, what|ever he thought proper.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="038531_0040_101250ECA5FE5568">That Captain Potter proceeded with both ve&s;&s;els to St. Croix, Teneriffe, and then tran&s;hipt military &s;tores and bag|gage from the I&s;abella (&s;he being entirely unfit for &s;ea &s;ervice, and accordingly condemned) to your Petitioner's &s;hip, the Enterpri&s;e, and broke open &s;ome other packages, and &s;tarted others, for the purpo&s;e of fitting up births for the accommo|dation of the &s;oldiers, who, to the number of 150, with wo|men and children, be&s;ides the I&s;abella's crew, were embarked on board the Enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>That during their &s;tay at Teneriffe, your Petitioner, John Soren, frequently reque&s;ted Captain Potter permi&s;&s;ion to go on &s;hore, that he might apply to the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul there for an inve&s;tigation of Captain Potter's proceedings, which Captain Potter refu&s;ed; and your Petitioner, John Soren, was detained a pri&s;oner on board the I&s;abella, until he was liberated by order of the Governor of the i&s;land&mdash;but he was not then permitted to carry on &s;hore any of his private property.</P>
<P>That Captain Potter &s;ailed from Teneriffe with your Pe|titioners' &s;aid &s;hip, the Enterpri&s;e, and your Petitioner, Cap|tain St. Barbe, on board her, but leaving your Petitioner, John Soren, at Teneriffe; and your Petitioners' &s;aid ve&s;&s;el arrived in Carli&s;le-bay, Barbadoes, on the 16th day of April 1796.</P>
<P>That during the voyage of the &s;aid &s;hip from Teneriffe to Barbadoes, Captain Potter endeavoured to &s;educe and corrupt the &s;ailors of the Enterpri&s;e, by giving them liquors, making them great promi&s;es, and otherwi&s;e, to induce them to &s;wear that the &s;hip and cargo were French and Dutch property; but finding &s;uch attempts ineffectual, he put them upon a very &s;canty allowance of bread and water, by which the health of the &s;eamen was greatly injured, particularly of the carpenter, who was likewi&s;e kept in chains.</P>
<P>That upon the arrival of the &s;hip Enterpri&s;e at Barbadoes, Captain Potter in&s;tituted a libel again&s;t her and the cargo, as
<PB N="43" REF="038531_0041_101250F0F5527F58">
a prize, in the Court of Vice-Admiralty in Barbadoes; to which a claim was entered by your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, on behalf of him&s;elf and the owners of the &s;aid &s;hip and cargo; and an order was made, on the application of your &s;aid Petitioner, that Captain Potter &s;hould give &s;ecurity for co&s;ts, in ca&s;e the &s;aid &s;hip &s;hould not be condemned:&mdash; Potter did not give &s;ecurity as ordered, but ab&s;conded; and the libel was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>That, very &s;oon afterwards, a libel was filed by the Ad|vocate-General again&s;t the &s;hip and cargo, as a droit of Admi|ralty; to which a claim was al&s;o put in by your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, on behalf of the &s;hip's owners and the per&s;ons intere&s;ted in her cargo; and proceedings being had and examinations taken in the &s;aid cau&s;e, the &s;ame was, on the 8th of September 1796, heard before the Hon. Jonathan Blenman, &s;ole Judge of the &s;aid Court; and upon &s;uch hear|ing, the &s;aid libel was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the &s;hip and cargo or|dered and adjudged to be re&s;tored to your Petitioner, Cap|tain St. Barbe, as the claimant of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>That your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, on the &s;aid &s;hip being delivered up to him, and &s;uch part of the cargo as had not been taken out of the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el, during the time &s;he re|mained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid Captain Potter, &s;old and di&s;|po&s;ed of &s;uch remaining cargo, by auction, for the net &s;um of 1756<HI>l.</HI> 9<HI>s.</HI> 9&frac34;<HI>d.</HI>; which occa&s;ions a lo&s;s to your Petitioners of the &s;um of 2349<HI>l.</HI> 12<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> &s;terling, upon the co&s;t price of the articles purcha&s;ed at Hamburgh.</P>
<P>That your Petitioners have annexed hereunto an account of the actual lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by them&s;elves and the other owners of the &s;aid &s;hip and her cargo.</P>
<P>That the owners of the Enterpri&s;e and her cargo, but for the detention afore&s;aid, would have gained a con&s;iderable profit upon the &s;ale of the cargo at Surinam; and your Petitioner, John Soren, had likewi&s;e engaged, by the charter-party, to freight the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el with coffee, at Surinam, to the amount,
<PB N="44" REF="038531_0042_101250F29DAAECC8">

<P>I am honoured with your Lord&s;hip's letter, dated De|cember 29th, inclo&s;ing a copy of a note received from Mr. King, together with its inclo&s;ure, relative to the &s;hip En|terpri&s;e, and reque&s;ting me to report to your Lord&s;hip my opinion on the merits of the ca&s;e, as far as I might be in|formed thereupon. In obedience to your Lord&s;hip's reque&s;t, I have con&s;idered the &s;ame, and report to your Lord&s;hip, that I am no further acquainted with the merits of the ca&s;e, than as they have appeared to me in a &s;tatement of the cir|cum&s;tances which was &s;ubmitted to me on the part of the American owners for my opinion, and in the papers now tran&s;mitted to me by your Lord&s;hip&mdash;That, according to the repre&s;entations contained therein, the American owners have &s;u&s;tained a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s, in con&s;equence of the mi&s;|conduct of the privateer; but that the law had offered a re|medy for the injury, by giving them a demand for co&s;ts and damages again&s;t Captain Potter, or, in ca&s;e of his in&s;olvency, again&s;t his &s;ecurities, and again&s;t his owners, who were all an&s;werable to the extent of the damages that might have been awarded again&s;t him&mdash;That this demand ought to have been made in the Vice-Admiralty Court, and was not in the lea&s;t degree precluded by the &s;ub&s;equent proceedings carried

<HEAD>No. XII. Letter from Mr. Soren to Lord Grenville.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My di&s;agreeable &s;ituation in this country, ari&s;ing from the circum&s;tance of having admini&s;tered to the relief of the Bri|ti&s;h &s;hip I&s;abella letter of marque, commanded by Captain Charles Potter, obliges me to apply to your Lord&s;hip for that redre&s;s and a&s;&s;i&s;tance the forms of law here deny me.</P>
<P>I beg leave to bring to your Lord&s;hip's recollection an application made on my behalf as freighter of the American &s;hip Enterpri&s;e, Captain Wyatt St. Barbe, by Mr. King, the American mini&s;ter, to your Lord&s;hip. The an&s;wers I have had the honour to receive, have been wholly again&s;t any <HI>legal</HI> claim upon my part, by rea&s;on of non-application
<PB N="48" REF="038531_0046_101250FCA91C5E48">
for damages, upon the acquittal of the Enterpri&s;e, libelled by Captain Potter in the Vice-Admiralty Court at Barbadoes as a prize. The rea&s;ons the Captain of the Enterpri&s;e a&s;&s;igns for &s;uch non-application for damages are, that his coun&s;el at Barbadoes advi&s;ed him to apply for damages in England, be|cau&s;e Potter had ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the i&s;land, and there was not any per&s;on within the juri&s;diction of the Admiralty Court again&s;t whom damages could be awarded, and as the owners of the I&s;abella, Me&s;&s;rs Tarleton and Backhou&s;e, re|&s;ided at Liverpool, in England.</P>
<P>I have procured the &s;everal opinions of Sir William Scott, Dr. Nicholls, and Mr. Gibbs, one of his Maje&s;ty's coun&s;el, who inform me no redre&s;s can be had by application either in the Admiralty or common law courts here. It falls, my Lord, hard indeed upon me. I &s;hall, unle&s;s I have a claim upon the humanity and accu&s;tomed genero&s;ity of the Briti&s;h Government, be utterly ruined&mdash;hard, my Lord, becau&s;e I had no opportunity hitherto of making any effectual application for redre&s;s. Having been left by Captain Potter at the i&s;land of Teneriffe, and wholly unable to proceed to Barbadoes, to pro&s;ecute my ca&s;e in the Admiralty Court there in per&s;on, I proceeded to England, (all my property withheld from me, and con&s;equently with much inconve|nience), to lay my ca&s;e before the Briti&s;h Government. I have been in this country upwards of two years, &s;olely upon this bu&s;ine&s;s; and I a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, from the circum|&s;tance of being, by &s;uch capture, &s;tripped of the greate&s;t part of my property, that I have, during my re&s;idence here, un|dergone much per&s;onal inconvenience.</P>
<P>The I&s;abella had on board near 300 troops for the We&s;t Indies. Humanity, my Lord, induced me to relieve the &s;hip, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I rendered, the majority of tho&s;e per&s;ons were conveyed in the Enterpri&s;e to the places of their de&s;tination. This, my Lord, Captain Potter would not deny, was he in this country. Some recompen&s;e I &s;ubmit, &s;hould be made, for forcing me out of my &s;hip at the point
<PB N="49" REF="038531_0047_1012299CCC0DF7D0">
of the bayonet, after having offered, to render any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power to Captain Potter; for &s;ending me on board the I&s;abella in the mi&s;erable condition &s;he was; but certainly, my Lord, for forcibly taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a neutral &s;hip, and expending my property. I only a&s;k &s;imilar humanity to be &s;hewn towards me, for my pre&s;ervation, as I extended to the per&s;ons on board the I&s;abella; for I am at this mo|ment without the pro&s;pect of placing my&s;elf in a &s;ituation to enable me to provide for my &s;upport. The Briti&s;h Govern|ment has in fact had the u&s;e of the Enterpri&s;e to forward the troops: I &s;ubmit, my Lord, whether &s;ome compen&s;ation ought not to be awarded for my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in that re&s;pect. My voyage to Surinam for coffee is entirely lo&s;t, and I have been unable to fulfil my mercantile engagements&mdash;Unable to pro|ceed to Barbadoes, I did, as I thought, and &s;till think, all in my power to &s;eek redre&s;s, by &s;ailing for England to make application there. No one, my Lord, upon examination of my ca&s;e, can doubt the hard&s;hip of it; and the only ar|gument to be alleged again&s;t my application is, that Captain St. Barbe (being advi&s;ed by his coun&s;el at Barbadoes) did not petition for damages there upon the acquittal of the &s;hip, at which place I am now even &s;hut out from applying for redre&s;s; nor was there a po&s;&s;ibility of ever applying on my part. How hard your Lord&s;hip &s;ees the&s;e circum&s;tances are upon me. I humbly conceive the Briti&s;h Government has, in many ca&s;es, a&s;&s;i&s;ted per&s;ons who do not &s;tand in a &s;ituation to make legal demands, but who&s;e claims are equitable and com|pa&s;&s;ionate. Such, my Lord, I apprehend is my ca&s;e: and as I have hitherto had no opportunity of pro&s;ecuting my ca&s;e in per&s;on, I have to reque&s;t &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance and redre&s;s, through your Lord&s;hip's means, as from the circum&s;tance of having relieved a Briti&s;h &s;hip in di&s;tre&s;s, with his Maje&s;ty's troops on board, which has brought me into my pre&s;ent con|dition, the equity of my ca&s;e, and my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, demand.</P>

<P>Soon after the receipt of your late letter, recapitulating the oppre&s;&s;ive circum&s;tances of the capture of your ve&s;&s;el and cargo, I &s;ent it enclo&s;ed in a note to the Trea&s;ury, with a view of a&s;&s;i&s;ting you in obtaining the difference between the &s;um you had received, and that which had been earned by your ve&s;&s;el, according to the u&s;ual rate of compen&s;ation in the tran&s;port &s;ervice; and I am &s;orry to inform you that the an|&s;wer which I have received affords me no rea&s;on to believe that this moderate demand will be &s;atisfied. According to the legal opinions which you have taken, you can have no remedy in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and the re&s;ult of my applications convinces me that &s;o far from obtaining from the Engli&s;h Government indemnity for your lo&s;&s;es, it is not likely that you will receive the re&s;idue of the compen&s;ation due for the u&s;e of your ve&s;&s;el in the tran&s;portation of a number of the King's troops to the We&s;t Indies. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I think it my duty to recommend to you to relinqui&s;h all farther &s;olicitation, and to return home without delay.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have peru&s;ed the narrative relative to the conduct of Captain Potter, with re&s;pect to the American &s;hip Enterpri&s;e, and find the &s;tatement true and correct, to the time when that &s;hip arrived at Barbadoes: In a few days afterwards I went with the regiment to which I belonged to St. Domingo.</P>
<P>The attention of my&s;elf and brother officers to you and your &s;hip's company, which you have mentioned in &s;uch hand|&s;ome terms, was no more than was due to people who had &s;o humanely come to the relief of a &s;hip in the mi&s;erable and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition in which the I&s;abella tran&s;port then was; and I &s;hould think it a want of ju&s;tice and candour not to acknowledge in this public manner, the obligation I and tho&s;e under my command were under to you and Captain St. Barbe, for &s;aving us in all probability from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>When Captain Potter in&s;i&s;ted upon making prize of your &s;hip, I interceded with him as much as in my power, repre|&s;enting to him that he could not condemn her; and that even if he could, (<HI>even if &s;he belonged to our mo&s;t inveterate enemy), yet, on account of the humane and generous manner in which you and Captain St. Barbe had behaved to us, &s;he ought to be re|&s;tored.</HI> Finding I could make no impre&s;&s;ion on him by calm remon&s;trances, I a&s;&s;umed a tone of authority, and <HI>in|&s;i&s;ted</HI> he &s;hould: on which he produced to me a letter of marque, and declared that if I interpo&s;ed in liberating his prize, I mu&s;t be an&s;werable to his owners.</P>
<P>When at Teneriffe, I again urged him to di&s;charge the Enterpri&s;e; at the &s;ame time informing him, that as there
<PB N="52" REF="038531_0050_101251066AE05568">
was no other &s;hip to be had at the i&s;land, and as I con|ceived from the &s;ituation of public affairs a rupture between Great Britain and Spain might be apprehended, in which ca&s;e the troops under my command might be detained pri|&s;oners of war, I would take upon my&s;elf, with the con&s;ent of you and Captain St. Barbe, to charter that &s;hip in the name of Government, to carry as many of the detachment as &s;he could to Barbadoes. He peremptorily refu&s;ed to relinqui&s;h her as prize: on which I told him I was much concerned at being obliged to be witne&s;s of his infamous conduct, and that I was certain his owners, as well as every other per&s;on in England who &s;hould hear of the tran&s;action, would highly condemn him.</P>
<P>At Teneriffe I reported his conduct to Mr. Favene, the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul there; and at Barbadoes to Admiral Sir John Laforey, commander in chief of his Maje&s;ty's fleet at that i&s;land, and al&s;o to his Excellency Governor Ricketts, who all expre&s;&s;ed their opinions, that his treatment of you and Cap|tain St. Barbe was cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive in the extreme; and further, when at Barbadoes, I made an affidavit of the facts before a magi&s;trate, in which I was joined by Captain Davis, and &s;hould al&s;o have been joined by Captain Thomas, but he was prevented, being obliged to go on board a &s;hip which was under way for St. Domingo.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I tru&s;t it will be manife&s;t to all who &s;hall read the narrative of your &s;ufferings, that tho&s;e who had the be&s;t opportunity of ob&s;ervation, were perfectly &s;atisfied of the iniquity of Captain Potter's conduct. As to my&s;elf, I &s;hall ever retain the mo&s;t grateful remembrance of the obligation I owe to you and Captain St. Barbe; and am, Sir,</P>
