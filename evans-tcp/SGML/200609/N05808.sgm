<P>THE Conflagration, Applied to that grand Period or Cata&s;trophe of our World, when the Face of Nature is to be changed by a Deluge of Fire, as formerly it was by that of Water.</P>

<P>_THE &s;entiments of authors are various in regard to the cau&s;e whence the Conflagration is to ari&s;e, and the effects it is to produce. Divines will have it take its ri&s;e from a miracle, as a fire from heaven; but philo&s;ophers contend for its being produced from natural cau&s;es: &s;ome think an eruption of the central fire &s;uf|ficient for the purpo&s;e; others look for the cau&s;e in the atmo&s;phere. The a&s;trologers account for it from a conjunction of all the planets in the &s;ign Cancer, as they &s;ay the deluge was occa&s;ioned by the conjunc|tion in Capricorn: but others a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves that the world is to undergo its conflagration from the near approach of a comet in its re|return from the &s;un; as the&s;e huge bodies, by the inten&s;ity of their heat, and their wandering tran&s;ver&s;e motion acro&s;s the earth's orbit, threaten to produce the mo&s;t &s;ignal changes and revolutions in the &s;y&s;tem of things.</P>

<L>Through the fine Aether moves no &s;ingle Breath;</L>
<L>But all is hu&s;h as in the Arms of Death.</L>
<L>At once, Great GOD! thy dire Command is giv'n,</L>
<L>That the la&s;t Tempe&s;t &s;hake the Frame of Heav'n.</L>
<L>Strait thick'ning Clouds in gloomy Volumes ri&s;e,</L>
