<HEAD>The Carrier of the AMERICAN MERCURY Wishes his Customers a HAPPY NEW-YEAR, And presents the following.</HEAD>
<L>I'M come, my friends, as Post-Boys use,</L>
<L>From bearing round the last years news,</L>
<L>To give you joy that Eighty Five</L>
<L>Has left us every soul alive;</L>
<L>Has left us plenty, peace and health,</L>
<L>To each a trifling share of wealth,</L>
<L>Enough, I hope, if profits fail,</L>
<L>To keep us this year out of jail.</L>
<L>Hard times, I grant, you've liv'd to see,</L>
<L>But who has harder times than me?</L>
<L>Here's a little Merc'ry, he can tell,</L>
<L>How long I've serv'd you and how well,</L>
<L>Each Monday morning, snow or rain,</L>
<L>From Water-Street to Cooper-Lane,</L>
<L>He's seen me scamper in three trices,</L>
<L>To bring you all his best advices.</L>
<L>While here you sate, as you do now,</L>
<L>And cross'd your legs and knit your brow,</L>
<L>And mark'd in his instructive page,</L>
<L>The frieks and follies of the age,</L>
<L>Saw nations rise and fall to ruin.</L>
<L>And every thing the world was doing.</L>
<L>But to the point&mdash;with this new-year,</L>
<L>I hope our better days draw near;</L>
<L>I wish you all may live to know,</L>
<L>Unmix'd with care or want or woe,</L>
<L>As many joys, and those <HI>good whappers.</HI></L>
<L>As you shall count me out of <HI>coppers.</HI></L>
