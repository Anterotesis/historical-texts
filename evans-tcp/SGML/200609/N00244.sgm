<P>THe Anabaptists in <HI>New-England,</HI> have in their Narrative lately pub|lished, endeavoured to make <HI>Candida de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> themselves the <HI>Innocent person</HI> and the Lords servants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no better than <HI>Persecutors.</HI> In which respect, it hath been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> necessary, that some one should <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> upon what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> done, that so such persons as have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> by their untrue Relation; may be disabused. Many are of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is not worth the while, to take notice of what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by men so obscure and inconsiderable. And I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I have though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> self; so far as I am personally concerned in any of their re|flections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lose precious time in a needless desence. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">; furore, ego <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> contemptu; &amp; vincit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, in Christ.</HI> It seems to me, that the Reverend Author of the following <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> versions,</HI> hath shewed much humility, in condescending to take persons in hand be|tween whom, and himself there is such an <HI>Impar congressus,</HI> and let it be, that for this once. He hath contradicted that proverbial saying <HI>Aquils non capit Muse as</HI> Had he not been sensible, that by good words, and fair speeches the hearts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are deceived, this pains would have been spared. I verily believe, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> baptists by their <HI>fallacious Narrative,</HI> have grievously offended God; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the things by them misrepresented, were not done a far off (for then mistakes a|bout them would have been excusable) but at home, where right Information was easie to have been obtained; had they been willing to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> others should have known the truth. And by this means, have they done ill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> themselves, forcing others to discover the enormities of some, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and shame should not have been divulged to the World, and to posterity fore|ver; but slept in a grave of silence: had not their own <HI>Narrative</HI> brought them forth. They have also by <HI>Letters,</HI> misrepresented worthy and honourable persons as well as things, and their reports have been received elsewhere, with too much readiness and credulity, as I perceive by certain Complainants, whosay they under|stand that the present Honourable Governour of this Colony, had threatned this poor people, their Christian friends (as they stile them) with death: which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> report of theirs, is like too many particulars in their vindication, an <HI>utter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> quil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> The Governour (whose integrity, wisdome, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> is well known) hath sometimes moved, that an old severe Law made against those that should manifest any publick contempt of that ordinance of <HI>Infant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> might be lenifyed. So far is the scandalous report which they have raised upon the Governour (and caused it to fly three thousand miles) from being true.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Brethren,</HI> that have thought good to prefix an Epistle to such a <HI>Narra|tive</HI> and there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> declare, that <HI>Molestation is given, and severity is exercised towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> England, meerly for a supposed Error about the subject of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, and holy men,</HI> they are marvelously deceived in
<PB REF="000309_0003_0FA4A9B76B735250">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> possibly I do not fully cape their meaning when they say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Protest and Congregation to persecute another, is more unreasonable then all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Church</HI> Some are ready to take it for an intimation, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Churches of Christ in <HI>New-England,</HI> are more cruel and unreasonable than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Romish Synagogue; like as the Anabaptists in <HI>Germany,</HI> looked upon such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Luther, Bullinger, Calvin, Zuinglius,</HI> &amp;c. to be worse than the Pope and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. But I hope they are far from any such insinuation, and that they de|sign no other then to suggest unto us, that for men whom God hath by his holy spirit made one through faith in Christ, to be cruel to their Brethren, is most un|reasonable. Which Assertion, (though true <HI>in Thesi</HI>) if applied to the Chur|ches of the Lord Jesus, in this Wilderness; it is both an erroneous conception, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> un just reflection, Protestants ought not to <HI>persecute</HI> any; yet, that Prote|stants may <HI>punish</HI> Protestants; and as the case may be circumstanced, a Congre|gation of such as call themselves Protestants: cannot rationally be denied. Those <HI>of the Congregational way</HI> (as themselves in the preface to their confession of Faith have professed) fully concurre with the <HI>old</HI> puritan <HI>Non-conformists,</HI> such as <HI>Cart|wright, Rainold, Whitaker, Bains, Parker,</HI> &amp;c. in whose writings, <HI>Congregational, Princi|ples</HI> about Church Government, are to be seen. Now the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> not|withstanding their sufferings from those that took delight to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> fellow|servants) did believe that disorders in whole Congregations were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the civil Magistrates censure, as is evident from that excellent and judicious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, cal|led <HI>Puritanismus Anglicanus,</HI> composed by Mr. <HI>Bradshaw,</HI> and published by Dr. <HI>Ames. Affirment si particular is aliqua ecclesia erraverit, Magistratus civilis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> redigere,</HI> Cap. 2. Th. 6. Why then should we be r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ndred as men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> rigid spirits and principles; when we say nothing but what <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Puritans,</HI> (worthy Confessors, and sufferers for the Truth) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> affirmed.</HI> Our famous <HI>Cotton,</HI> was another <HI>Moses,</HI> in respect of meekness, and christian forbeatance, as to Dissenters from his judgement in matters of a lesser concernment, yet would he sometimes make a zealous Protestation, that if Ma|gistrates in <HI>New-England</HI> should tolerate Transgressors against the Rules of <HI>god|liness</HI> (as well as offences contrary to what the rules of <HI>honesty</HI> require) he be|lieved that God would not long tolerate them. And whereas the Brethren that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Epistle, pray the Honourable Governours in <HI>New-England,</HI> to be careful of doing that which may give occasion of trouble to <HI>Nonconformists</HI> elsewhere: I shall heartily joyn with them in the same request; and I can assure them, that consideration hath caused more indulgence to be exercised towards their Friends (as they call them) here, than ever they were worthy of. And I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it will be so still, so far as may consist with Scripture Rules, and the safety of the interest of Christs Kingdome in this Wilderness. These Churches are <HI>Tender vines,</HI> and I cannot perswade my self, that the Brethren when they rightly understand things, will think that the Magistrate should see <HI>little Foxes spoiling</HI> them, and should look on all the while, as one no way concerned. As for those of the <HI>Antipaedobaptistical perswasion,</HI> which differ from us only in that particulars I would speak to them as unto Brethren, whom (their Error (for so I believed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is) notwithstanding) I love, and would bear with, and exercise the same indul|gence and compassion towards them, as I would have others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to me; who feel my self compassed with infirmities.</P>
<P>I have been a poor labourer in the Lords Vineyard in this place upwards of twenty years: and it is more than I know, if in all that time, any of those that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Infant-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, have met with molestation from the Magistrate meerly
<PB REF="000309_0004_0FA4A9B837552D28">
on the account of their Opinion. I would there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> others of their perswasion, who may be of a Christian and moderate-spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> have subscribed the Epistle, seriously to consider;</P>
<P N="1">1. That the place may sometimes make a great alteration, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to be expected. It is evident, that that Toleration is in one place. not-only lawful, but a necessary duty, which in another place would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the expectation of it irrational. That which is needful to ballast a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will sink a small boat. If a considerable number of <HI>Antipaedobaptists</HI> should (as our Fathers here did) obtain Liberty from the State, to transport themselves and families, into a wast, <HI>American wilderness,</HI> that so they might be a peculiar People by themselves; practising all, and only; the institutions of Christ: if now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Baptists</HI> should come after them, and intrude themselves upon them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they cast men out of their society for moral Scandals, entertain them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they would desire such persons; either to walk orderly with them, or to return to, the place from whence they came. And if they would do neither, they would, think that such <HI>Paedo-Baptists</HI> were blame-worthy: let them then do as they would be done by; and deal by us as they would have us to deal by them, were they in our case, and we in theirs.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let them please to consider; that those of their perswasion in this place, have acted with so much irregularity and prophaneness, that should men of any other perswasion, whatsoever, have done the like, the same severity would have been used towards them. I truly profess unto them, that if any men, either of the Presbyterian, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Congregational (or never so much of my) perswasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> matters referring to Church-Discipline, should behave themselves as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>Boston,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> have done, I think they would have deserved far greater punishment than any thing that to this day, hath been inflicted, upon them. Whether the sentence passed on them by the Churches, proceeding in the Name of the Lord Jesus, were only the abuse of an holy Ordinance; or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> process according to Scripture Rule: the following Ammadversions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> unto those that are willing to weigh matters Impartially, in the ballance of the Sanctuary. How vain is it for men, after they have received such Excommuni|cates into their communion, and them perceive that the World cries shame on them for it; and some of their own perswasion reprove them: in stead of abhor|ring themselves before God and the World; and purging out the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> think they shall come off with saying, <HI>It was a defect! and who in this world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> without their failings</HI> and then by retaining such in their communion to persist in their scandal to this very day? To parallel the case of the Anabaptists in <HI>New|England,</HI> with that of the <HI>Nonconformists in England,</HI> seems most unreasonable. Do the conforming Congregations there, cast men out of their fellowship for moral, scandalous evils? I doubt the <HI>godly Discipline</HI> which their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> confes|seth was in the Primitive Church, and should be in theirs, is not found amongst them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> should, I believe the Nonconformists would be loth to receive any such into their Communion; which the <HI>New-England</HI> Anabaptists have done and have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> therein from year to year, and that after conviction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Narrative,</HI> they seek to palliate this offence, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Representation of things; their iniquity is marked before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and much <HI>So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> will never wash them clean. If then Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> shall go about to stir up Persecution against conscientious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB REF="000309_0005_0FA4A9B8E37744F8">
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> and endeavour to justifie it by the practice of Congregational <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>New-England:</HI> we see not that any real advantage hath been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, (only taken) from proceedings here. The Author of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> called <HI>The Mischief of Impositions,</HI> hath given a fair, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> answer to the <HI>Doctor,</HI> as to this particular. They say, those of the Congregational way in <HI>England, plead for Anabaptists liberty as for their own.</HI> That they plead for liberty and indulgence to be ex|tended towards those that differ from them only in that point of <HI>Paedo-Baptisme,</HI> I believe: when I was in <HI>England,</HI> I did so my self; and if I were their now, I would do so again: but that they should plead for liberty unto such practices, as our Anabaptists have been guilty of, is not easie to believe; or, if they do, it is because such <HI>Narrators</HI> as these <HI>Animadverted</HI> upon, have by untrue Relations misguided them into undue Apprehensions. Nay, I am fully convinced, that those of their own way, if of serious and gracious Spirits, when once they are possessed with a true Relation of things concerning them, will see cause to condemn <HI>New-England</HI> less, and those their Friends more, than at first they were aware of: How did they bear the World in hand, that the Churches here did Excommunicate them for nothing but their O|pinion, in scrupling <HI>Paedobaptisme!</HI> But that therein they have dealt most untruely, and injuriously; the subsequent Answer to their <HI>Nar|rative</HI> hath made apparent from the Church-Records concerning those matters.</P>
<P>Finally, let me intreat the Brethren to believe, that some of us would shew as much indulgence unto truly tender Consciences, as themselves. It is not so long since our own Necks bled under an intolerable yoke of Imposition upon Conscience, as that we should forget what it is to be so dealt with; or exercise that severity towards any, that we have our selves complained of, in others. But the Bre|thren will readily own that some men have pretended Conscience, when pride, &amp; perverseness in the will, have been at the bottom: They will also confess, that a meer pretence of Conscience, is not enough to bear men out in an evil practice. All the difficulty is, in discerning the one of these from the other. Blessed Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> in his excellent <HI>Irenicum,</HI> hath laid down Rules concerning this: And if that which he saith, <HI>pag.</HI> 32. be sound Doctrine (as undoubtedly it is) some of our <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> have not such characters of a tender Conscience upon them, as were to be desired. If men will call <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Practices</HI> by the name of their <HI>Opinion:</HI> and when their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> born witness against make out cries, that they suffer for their
<PB REF="000309_0006_0FA4A9BC992A5E18">
Opinion, and for their Conscience: How is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or those help them, who desire to keep their own Consciences pure, and with out offence towards God, by being faithful according to that capaci|ty the Lord hath set them in; and giving a due testimony against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> things, which they believe provoke him to jealousie? And if <HI>A|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> in this Land, have declared their agreement with those of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> like perswasion in <HI>England,</HI> as to matters of Faith and Worship: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not, but that there are many godly <HI>Antipaedobaptists</HI> there, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will never declare their agreement with those here, as to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> practices, which have been so offensive to Christ, and unto his people in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>

<P>I shall begin with the Title, which promifeth fair, and looks inno|cently; but yet (methinks) might have done better to have spoken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and told us indeed what it intended.

Next he tells us the moving cause of that Narrative, which is very honest and good; It is <HI>for the cleaving of their innocency</HI> and that every good man may lawfully do, and some|times ought. The first Fathers in the Church wrote their Apologies.

The intendment, of it is to accuse this Government and these Churches of Persecuting the Saints and Servants of Christ: and they begin with the Churches where (wise|ly taking the Question for granted, which might have put them to some difficulty to have proved) they endeavour to aggravate our guilt by divers Arguments.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our practises are contrary to <HI>the Principles and practises of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Congregational way in</HI> England, <HI>which do equally plead for the liberties of the</HI> Anabaptists <HI>as their own</HI>] But let them not be angry if we are hard to believe that those of the Congregational way in <HI>England,</HI> do judge such <HI>Anabaptists</HI> as these in <HI>New-Engl.</HI> to be as Orthodox as themselves, and deserve like countenance and favour; or that Magistrates and Churches are no wayes bound to labour (ac|cording to the power given them) to suppress Errors scandalously persisted in, or to manifest a practical dislike of them: is not this to scandalize the congregational Churches there, that they may better accuse them here?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Our practises are contrary to the design of our first Planters, who left all for liberty of Conscience, and we are the Children of those that felt the lash of Imposition, and yet will shew to others the like severity.</HI>] I per|ceive they are mistaken in the design of our first Planters, whose busi|ness was not Toleration; but were professed Enemies of it, and could leave the World professing they <HI>died no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Libertines.</HI> Their business was to settle, and (as much as in them lay) secure Religion to Po|sterity, according to that way which they believed was of God. If (therefore) this People parted with so much and were at such char|ges for their liberties why then do the Anabaptists trouble them, who had neither scot nor lot in that charge? let them go and do the like, and we shall not so molest their Churches, as they have shamefully done by ours.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="5" REF="000309_0011_0FA4A9C1728C8570">
3. <HI>It is against their Brethren</HI>] the sincerity of the expression <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> much to be suspected, since we know that they do deny us to be, so much as visible Christians, while they declare our Baptisme, not only to be a mal Administration, but a meer nullity. But granting it, we never could finde that Discipline rightly administred, was against Christian charity; and yet the subject of it is Brethren; yea the neg|lect of that duty (in case) would argue want of love, if not hatred, Levit. 19. 17.</P>
<P N="4">4. But they are Brethren that <HI>avowedly profess and appeal to the same rule</HI>] But what if the Churches, in their bearing witness against them, do appeal to the same rule? and think they should violate it by neglecting this duty, how shall we do then? why do they censure our Church censures against them that have sometimes been our Members? we do avowedly appeal to the same rule. Is it sufficient to satisfie men in one anothers proceedings (though contrary) be|cause they appeal to the same rule; this must certainly be some <HI>Les|bian Rule,</HI> that may square to all mens Opinions and fancies.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That the present molestation given them is meerly for a supposed Er|ror relating to the Subject of Baptisme</HI>] Here learn, how dangerous a thing it is, to take a thing for truth, upon the credit of prejudiced persons. How untrue this is, there will be afterward occasion in di|vers examples to make appear: only we must give them leave to call it a <HI>supposed</HI> error; but with whom? with them it is a believed truth, and of such weight, that it were better set a fire on the World than not stand up in it's defence: and (I can assure them) with us it is more than a supposed error: and yet that that hath been the only ground of their being molested, shall also appear to be more than a supposed falshood.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is a matter which hath been, and (if we believe them) is still <HI>sub judice: controverted, and that between learned and judicious, holy and good men</HI>] why then should they be so stiffe for it, or we a|gainst it? it is very weak for men to be so rigid on all hands about a nice controversie, and indeterminable question, which learned and good men have not these 1600 years known how to determine. But (upon search) I finde it hath been both professed and defended in all ages by the Churches of Christ: though this truth (as many o|thers) hath not escaped the opposition of men left by God to a spi|rit of error: but it hath fared as well, as almost any great Gospel Truth; God having ever raised up worthy Patrons for the defence of it.

To scare us the more with this, they tell us how Dr. <HI>Stilling. fleet</HI> improved it to the same purpose against us] all I shall say to this is, we cannot confess guilty, for the censure of those, who neither knowing what we do, nor weighing the difference of cases (which they would make parallels) rashly conclude against us: we humbly con|ceive men that are not prejudiced, will easily discern that suppressing with all gentleness and tenderness, a dangerous error and of bad ten|dency (such as <HI>Anabaptism</HI> especially so circumstanced as in <HI>New|England</HI> it hath been) and the enforcing of Ceremonies in Religion, which are neither directly, nor by any good consequence required, in or by the word of God, do differ <HI>toto coelo.</HI></P>

<P>Now follows the Narrative it self, in which the first thing that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> us is (indeed) a brief account of their congregating, or that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of theirs in gathering a Church; where we have the moving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the manner, and the materials of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The moving cause of it is brief and pithy: <HI>It pleased God to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their hearts</HI>] and if this be indeed so, then those that opposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in it, and endeavoured to suppress them, will be found fighters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> against God, and to act in vain, for the Will of God shall be accom|plished, and no weapon formed against it shall prosper: and this Ar|gument we shall finde them making use of (<HI>page</HI> 2.) But who knows not that all Hereticks pretend to the Spirit and Direction of God; though it's certain that in so doing they take the Name of God in vain: and it's little less then Blasphemy to bring God in, to patronize their sinful Actions: For,</P>
<P N="1">1. God doth not graciously move the hearts of any to irregular and unlawful Actions; and though men are very prone to entitle Him to it, yet He utterly disclaims it, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 13, 14.</P>
<P N="2">2. And it is certain that when men grow wanton, and despise the Ordinances; God (many times) judicially gives them strong delusi|on to believe a lye, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2. 10, 11. and that is none of the least, to misjudge a seducing spirit to be the spirit of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. To follow an erring Conscience, which verily believes his error to be the truth, is not to follow the direction of the Spirit of God. If what God forbids, Conscience perswades, this is not of Gods appro|bation for so He should be against himself. It is a snare and a judge|ment to be under such a Conscience; so that they must pardon us if we suspect the moving cause.</P>
<P N="2">2.

It is a piece of arre|gancy for men to beg the principle, or forcibly impose upon our be|lief that which is the very Dispute and Controversie between us, <HI>i. e.</HI> whither it be an error or no: and they tell us God taught them, therefore it is no error, true, but if we reply, it is an error, there|fore God taught them not, where are we now? are <HI>Anabaptists</HI> only

<P>We have now done with the Narrative (handsomely contrived in one page) the other fourteen are Apologetical, which they were put upon for three Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. To Emblazon the Names of their dead Founders, and prevent the Worlds being mistaken in them: and truly, first Founders deserve a Record, and they should be unworthy Successors if they did not Canonize them: though (as things are circumstanced) some wise men think they had done them a kindness if they had said nothing: and to me, I am sure, for then I had been prevented this undesired task of publishing the follies of men after they are dead. The childe doth his Father the best kindness to say nothing of him, when by speaking he doth but revive his Infamy. But I take it for a just judgement of God on that generation of men that by a <HI>fallacious Narrative,</HI> they should enforce us to make the World acquainted with the scandalous conversation of these beginners, which had otherwise slept in the pri|vate
<PB N="10" REF="000309_0016_0FA4A9C79E40B488">
records of those Churches wherein they were acted.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The very grievous Scandals cast upon these Beginners</HI>] <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> men (if incorrigible) deserve to have scandals cast upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and if we shall prove these such, they must (for ought I know) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Reproach of it, and thank themselves.</P>
<P>But yet there are two things wherein they are to be blamed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lay scandal to them; though just, yet it is unjustly done. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. The frame of spirit they do it with, they <HI>are rugged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> truly this becomes not men who profess a Spirit of Meekness: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> yet sometimes the Gospel calls Christians to withstand Seducers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the face; to characterize some men in their proper colours, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> earnestly with them for the Truth: yea, experience tells us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> such a rough thing as a <HI>New-England Anabaptist</HI> is not to be handle] ever tenderly: the spirit which they have at all times discovered un|der the greatest disadvantages (and God grant that they may never have more advantage over us) easily tells us what they would have been, if circumstanced as those whom they accuse.</P>
<P N="2">2. A wicked end: and a good action may be spoiled by a bad de|sign at bottom: <HI>We have charged them on purpose to make them odious, and make the World believe them a people not fit to live</HI>) men wonder|fully sagacious, and extreamly charitable!

<P>But, suppose it be made appear that we have not endeavoured to ren|der their persons odious but only their perverse Doctrine, and that we have used all meekness, patience, gentleness towards men in that ca|pacity we took them to be in? for any such passage of any of ours as judging them not fit to live, I know not of it, nor (I believe) do they, nor do we patronize any such expression, though (since their Book hath so many in it) I know not why this may not go for one of their mistakes: and now they <HI>appeal to God</HI>) we accept it readily.</P>

<PB N="11" REF="000309_0017_0FA4A9C905EB6180">
up this discourse; The persecution, and the success.</P>
<P N="1">1. The persecution is compendiously represented. <HI>Some of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were oftentimes brought before Councils,</HI> &amp;c.] (I suppose they allude to <HI>Mat.</HI> 10. 17.) To which let this be taken as a Reply, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that as the Honoured Magistrates here are Christian, so have they judged it their duty to maintain the ways of Christ, and strengthen them by civil Laws, which hath not only been the practice of Reformers of old, but the constant Judgement of the Church of Christ ever since the Apostles. If evil minded men will take this advantage to op|press the truth, it is no more then may be done in all other cases: &amp; as it is thought no good plea to keep the Scriptures from the laity, lest they should learn to be Hereticks; so neither to deny the Magistrate his due power on supposition that he may abuse it. On this Princi|ple our worthy Rulers have made Laws against many Sects and In|truders, and among the rest the <HI>Anabaptists.</HI> That in quelling the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> they do not oppose the truth, but suppress Error they are fully perswaded: and although they never pretended to a Lord|ship over mens Consciences, yet they account the outward man is subject to them: and if we must tarry till all men are agreed about what is truth before we oppose Error, we shall stay till there is no need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. For the progress of our Magistracy in the execution of these Laws, they have been so far from a violent, eager, or willing taking advantage against these men, that (notwithstanding their opprobri|ous speeches when they have been before them, their scornful carria|ges, and purposed indeavours to irritate them by insolent challenges) they have alwayes proceeded slowly, tenderly, far on this side the Law, as those who sought not to ruine either their Names, Liberties, or Estates. How often when fines have been laid upon them, have they stopt the Execution? if any have been imprisoned, it hath been but when dared to it: and though once a Sentence of Banishment did pass upon two of their Ring-leaders (heady violent men) yet then they neglected, and scorned to take notice of it (resolving to run utmost hazards) neither was this improved as any advantage a|gainst them. Nor is it to be wondred that our Governours have been opposite in particular to these men, since, if they could get head a|mong us, they would certainly undermine the Churches, ruine Order, destroy piety, and introduce prophaness.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the success of these endeavours: <HI>God is pleased still to up|hold them, and they are by these means not weakened, but strengthened and increased</HI>) Methinks I hear the Jews crying, <HI>we are delivered to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

That <HI>Thomas Gold,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Osborn</HI> (the persons in dispute were Schismaticks, or did unjustly rend from the Church where they were before Members, will appear by a true Relation of matters of fact (for this story of the Narrative, and Truth are Strangers) whereof there is sufficient Testimony to be found in the Re|cords of the Church at <HI>Charlstown</HI> (whereof they were Members) and there are many faithful witnesses yet alive, who were present at these transactions and can say, if these things be not so; which ought to outweigh the story of a prejudiced person, who hath all by hear|say, whose very business is to palliate and lick over matters to shape them to his own turn: Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. For <HI>Goodman Gold:</HI> Let the Reader consider these things; and let the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> disprove them if they can.</P>
<P N="1">1. That though he was first called to an account about withhold|ing his childe from Baptisme, yet that was not the reason of his being admonished (as the Pamphlet asserts) nor because he could not be convinced of Error; not yet did the Church proceed to Admonition, till such time as (he not only spake contemptuously and irreligiously of the emptiness &amp; nullity of that Ordinance, but also) used unbecoming gestures in the time of Administration, of which (being asked the rea|son) he (before the Congregation) acknowledged they <HI>were</HI> to cast disresect upon it: nor then neither till after much patience. Now let <HI>Anabaptists</HI> themselves judge whither there be not a vast diffe|rence, between doubting about an Ordinance, and professedly vilify|ing of it by unhandsome words and carriages; and whither they will bear with any Member of theirs that will so contemn any of those things which are to them sacred, and acknowledged as Christs Insti|tutions.</P>
<P N="2">2, That at his first Admonition he was not sententially suspended, but only desired for the preventing of the offence of some, to abstain from coming to the other Sacrament.</P>
<P N="3">3. That upon This, <HI>Thomas Gold</HI> took up a trade of absenting him|self from the Meetings of the Church to worship God on the Sab|bath, which made a new offence.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Church in much tenderness waited upon him, and (af|ter many provocations) proceeded not to Excommunication, but tried with Admonition upon Admonition, and that by the space of seven or eight years: nor was he Excommunicated, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> having left his own.) he joyned to another Society, without the churches leave; or once asking it: and now also being twice sent for by the Church

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> their authority over him.</P>
<P N="5">5. That <HI>Thomas Gold</HI> did not leave the Church at <HI>Charlstown</HI> on the account of the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> new Church (as is pretended) but had many years before renounced his submission to that Church.</P>
<P N="6">6. That he did (while under Admonition) neglect publick wor|ship, and gather a private meeting on the Sabbath to his house.</P>
<P N="7">7. That he did (contrary to the Judgement of Anabaptists them|selves) wickedly slight the Admonition of the Church, declaring that they had by it discharged him of all relation to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. For <HI>Thomas Osborne;</HI> the Churches proceedings with him were with the like patience as to <HI>Thomas Gold:</HI> only it is to be observed, that his first offence (which this dissembling Pamphlet, finding it dis|advantagious, wilfully passeth over) was this: whereas it is one thing which Church-members engage to upon Admission, to walk with the Church in constant attendance upon publick worship, he (without notifying any offence) did withdraw and separate, fre|quenting those Schismatick Meetings at <HI>Golds</HI> on the Sabbath: this was the offence (where was the Narrators Conscience mean while?) nor did he (when first dealt with) pretend any disl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ke of Infant Ba|ptisme, but that the Church gave no liberty to private Brethren to Prophesie, that they limited the Ministry to learned men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he did not find his own spirit free to come: though afterwards he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> both of that, and of their severity to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> though that Church medled not with them, but only to preach against their Er|rors. In this practice he contumaciously persisted many years, deny|ing himself to be subject to that Church, or bound to assemble with them (though he had solemnly given himself up to them in Covenant) slighting many Admonitions; and afterwards (with <HI>Thomas Gold</HI>) went off to, and became a worthy Pillar of an <HI>Anabaptist</HI> Church. And whereas he insists so upon a bitter spirit in the Church against dissenters, let seven years patience, with serious endeavours (in all tenderness) to reclaim them, speak whither it be not an audacious Slander. And now (Reader) judge, are these a Church of Schis|maticks or no?</P>

<P N="2">2. That we are Scandalous in three respects. 1. <HI>The Foundation was laid with Excommunicate persons. 2. We called such to Admini|ster holy things, who were justly for scandal cast out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Churches. 3. For receiving such into our Society.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="000309_0021_0FA4A9CCCF014F00">
<HI>Ans..</HI> This is indeed the charge, from the just imputation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all their tergiversations, excuses, suppressions of the truth, and sug|gestions of falshood, shall never acquit them. I find not that he de|nies the first proposition, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that those who do such things (adding the word <HI>justly</HI> to the first part of the charge) are to be reputed scandalous. That they have so done remains to be proved.</P>
<P N="1">1. Their Foundation was laid with persons excommunicated, and that for scandal: for this it may be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Thomas Gold</HI> was not admonished for his Opinion (nor doth it appear that ever he should, if he had carried humbly) but for op|probrious words and carriages against an Ordinance. Which he him|self had before professedly reverenced and highly esteemed and which he knew that Church he walked with had still in the like esteem. And <HI>Thomas Osborne,</HI> by relinquishing publick Worship directly violated his Covenant, not so much as pretending (at first) any doubt about infant Baptisme.</P>
<P N="2">2. They both of them despised the Church, continued to absent themselves, laid false charges against them, separated in a private meeting, went off to the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> without asking leave, and so be|came (supposed) Members of one, before they were regularly dis|charged of their obligation to another Church: all which things are against the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> own professed Rules if they will stand to their confession. Whereas he faith, <HI>their not hearing the Church was nothing else but their not coming when the Church sent for them]</HI> it is a foolish pretence: their not hearing the Church was their appearing and proving themselves impenitent and that after many Treaties used with them many solemn Admonitions laid upon them, convictions sufficiently offered, of sins against the light of their Consciences, and which (it's certain) they would have acknowledged, had it not been for fear of being reconciled to the Church, whose Excommunication they feared not, but impudently des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">red. The truth is, they were weary of their Church Relation, and resolved to get rid of it, and not knowing any regular way to obtain it, they chose to sin rather then suffer; and undergo a just Excommunication, that they might be by themselves; presuming that they could blind the World with a vain pretense that they were ejected for no other reason but be|cause they questioned the right of Infant Baptisme. Hence <HI>Thomas Gold</HI> did particularly express before the Church his desire to be ex|communicated, which yet they proceeded not to (till by a first and second refusal to appear at the Churches citing of them) they pro|ved
<PB N="16" REF="000309_0022_0FA4A9CD44012D50">
themselves incorrigible. Besides, it is to be observed that these men (having privately exercised their gifts in Meetings with ap|plause) began to think themselves wronged that their light was put under a bushel; and finding no remedy in our Churches, threw on, a cloak of <HI>Anabaptisme,</HI> and so gained the thing they aimed at, in a dis|guise.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They called such to Administer,</HI> &amp;c.] against all his winding to get clear of this, [only say, <HI>Thomas Gold</HI> was thus imployed, con|cerning whom too much hath been said, except we had better to say.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They have received such as have (justly) for moral evils been cast out of other Churches;</HI> adde, and never given Christian satisfaction. Here he endeavours a <HI>salvo.</HI> The persons instanced are <HI>Thomas Fos|ter,</HI> and <HI>John Farnham;</HI> the former sometimes of the Church as <HI>Bil|lerica.</HI> the other of the <HI>second gathered Church in Boston.</HI> He acknow|ledgeth they have received them but on just reasons, or (at worst) not very irregularly. Let the Records of these Churches be com|pared with this Narrative, and see if the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> have not good skill in painting, and putting a fair face on a foul matter.</P>
<P N="1">1. For <HI>Thomas Foster,</HI> let it be observed.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he was not only a Member of the Church of <HI>Billerica,</HI> but of the Foundation, and at their gathering was full, free, and for|ward in owning Infant Baptisme to be as Ordinance of Christs Insti|tution: and if he judged himself (that notwithstanding) to have been then a true Christian he ought to have extended more charity (then his after expressions) shewed to the Church still remaining of the same perswasion.</P>
<P N="2">2. That he first discovered his receding from that (formerly recei|ved) judgement by disorderly carriage at the time of Administration of that Ordinance, and being reproved for it, he confessed he had carried unbecoming any person in any Christian Assembly; which gave satisfaction to the Church.</P>
<P N="3">3. Though, (when about three months after this, he began, and thence continued to leave the meeting at the celebration of Baptism,) he was, at a private Church meeting given to understand that it grie|ved the Brethren, and that he had receded from his Covenant and was advised solemnly and seriously to consider of it, yet he was not (as the Narrator asserts) laid under Admonition, or prohibited Com|munion: nor did the Church ever do any such thing in private to any (which he knew) nor did they intend for this, to have debarred him of Communion.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="17" REF="000309_0023_0FA4A9CE01603410">
4. That after this, he neglected the Church Assemblies; and fre|quented the <HI>Anabaptist</HI> meetings, and was there rebaptized: and be|ing called by the Church at a meeting; at the Pastors house, to give an account of these proceedings; though at first he dissembled, yet at length acknowledged, and justified his actions, (if false charges may be accounted a justification:) For he told them;</P>
<P N="1">1. That they had <HI>laid him under sin, whereas he thought he had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> amiss;</HI> but they had not so done judicially; though they told him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> carriage was a grief to his Brethren: nor (as I have said before) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> intended it; so far is the Narration from speaking truth, when it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>nothing but matter of Conscience was</HI> (or could be) <HI>laid to his charge.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That they denied him Baptisme:</HI> whereas they owned him for Baptized, and if he was not it was wickedness in him (an unbaptized person) to come to the Lords Table.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That they yoked him with Unbelievers:</HI> which was, because they extended Church watch to a Child (or children) of the Church: and yet, for this, he judged his separation lawful, and produced for it 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 14, 15, 17. therein (implicitly at least) pronouncing the Church a company of <HI>Belialists</HI> and <HI>Infidels.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That they had presented him to the Court]</HI> The truth is, one of the Brethren of the Church, had made complaint of him to the Grand-jury, which occasioned his presentment, judging his Free|mans oath engaged him so to do, when other due means to reclaim him from his turbulent carriages had been used; and this he makes the Churches fault, because they did not lay that Brother under a censure, for not daring to violate his Oath, and betray his Fidelity to the Civil Authority.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That they had dealt injuriously by one of his Brethren, in laying him under Admonition]</HI> In justification of which act there needs no account be given here; only, let any judge whither it be a just ground to separate from a Church, because I am not fully of their mind in every act of Administration: and also, it seems a thing not warrantable for a private Member of a Church (in pretence of self|vindication) to vilifie and asperse a Church of Christ: if this be hu|mility, what is pride? But yet,</P>
<P N="5">5. The Church still continued to labour his conviction: and when they could not obtain it, after much patience, they called him forth in publick, charged him with offensive departing, and rending away from the Church; denying himself a subject of Discipline, and vili|fying

the Church by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> charges: he, observing on ready to write his Answer, refused to speak any thing, unless <HI>he</HI> were forbidden; and not obteining it, essayed to depart; yea, though required by the Officer to stay, and hear the Church, he wilfully withdrew: on the following Sabbath, he was for these carriages admonished, and de|barred Communion, and not till then: and after some patience used being called forth again, to see if it repented him, he remained obsti|nate, and was therefore Excommunicated: and now compare notes, and see what will become of <HI>John Russel's</HI> consectaries: As for his retaining the respect of a very Godly man where he is known (which is so boasted of) it must be only among men void of reason, for (though we will not say but he may have the root in him; yet) he hath blasted profession, by wicked wayes impenitently persisted in, and thereby wounded such mens charity, who judge (as they ought) of the tree by the fruit.</P>

<P N="2">2.

<P N="2">2. <HI>That he was deputed by them for a Deacon</HI>] and yet neither the present Teacher; nor any that have been added to the Church, these twenty years, either deputed, or thought him fit for that Office: and whereas there is but one surviving of the Founders of that Church, he professeth there is never a syllable of truth in that report.</P>

<P N="5">5. <HI>Other things were gathered to this, having a face of Scandal.</HI></P>
<P>A true survey of the Churches proceedings, will shew the va|nity of these Assertions: For,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Church did not so much as deal with him till he had whol|ly withdrawn Communion from them, refusing so much as to hear the Word Preached with them for many months, no, nor so much as de|clared themselves offended with him. What now is this rugged spirit?</P>
<P N="2">2. When he alledged his Opinion, the Teacher of the Church (though possibly some may think he did more than the rule requi|red) declared to him, <HI>that if he were so weak as not to think it lawful to see a Child Baptized, his withdrawing when that Ordinance was Ad|ministered, should not be imputed as an offence:</HI> how is it then that <HI>his</HI> Judgement was the principal thing in that process?</P>
<P N="3">3. His offence for which he was dealt with, was many moral evils (and so a complicate offence) breaking forth at once: <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> 1. Re|nouncing Communion with the Church, contrary to <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 24. 2. Holding familiarity with Excommunicate Persons, contrary to <HI>Math.</HI> 18 17. 2. <HI>Thess.</HI> 3. 6, 14. 3. Slanders against several holy and worthy men (now with Christ.) 4. That having been often repro|ved for these things he still persisted. When the Elders reproved him for these slanders he replied, that <HI>they might be offended at a thou|sand things, he cared not:</HI> and that <HI>there was never an</HI> Elder <HI>in</HI> New|England <HI>was willing any should read the Scripture, but themselves:</HI> Af|ter this, he was called before the Church, tenderly dealt with, and those Scripture Rules which he had transgressed were applied to his Conscience: but in vain.</P>
<P>At the third Church Meeting on his account (<HI>Octob.</HI> 16. 1665.) the Pastor (Mr. <HI>Mayo</HI>) told him it wos expected that after so much patience he should manifest repentance. His reply was, that <HI>he desi|red none of their patience, he was humbled for his sins.</HI> The Teacher (Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> saying to him, we must see it by the fruits, he retorted, <HI>you see it! you shall never see it:</HI> some Brethren told him his speeches and carriage were very sinful they had never seen the like be replied, <HI>I did not come hither to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at by every one,</HI> and so he turned his back to depart: the Pastor wished him to stay and hear what further they had to say, and seeing him still proceed, charged him in the Name of the Church and of Christ to stay: he rejoyned,

<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Christ to me, I am not out that can how and stoop <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">;</HI> &amp; <HI>exit.</HI> The same day he told some of the Brethren that he wished the Church would Excommunicate him, and then he should be of a better society. On all these accounts was he laid un|der Admonition. Two months after which, being called before the Church, he, in words, confest the evil of some of the particulars, but was observed at the same time to turn about and laugh: where then was his Repentance? The Church (this notwithstanding) waited divers months longer, till he went on to that height of impiety and prophaneness, that one of the Teaching Officers, setting before the Church the Rule concerning Excommunication, <HI>Farnum</HI> makes a <HI>leg</HI> to him (in the Assembly) in way of derision, and declared, that ex|cept the Church would yield to four things, he would have no com|munion with them: <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>1. They must set up the Ordinance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. 2. Promise to Baptize no more Infants. 3. All be Baptized (i. e. rebaptized) themselves. 4. Put away their present (and still continuing) Teacher from his Office.</HI> Upon these things the Church concluded upon his censure, only allowing him another months pati|ence: after which (no repentance appearing) they proceeded.</P>
<P>Now judge: 1. Whither these things have no more than a <HI>face</HI> of scandal and that too, only as they are taken and construed. 2. Whither their Admission of him were not more than a meer de|fect in those who so admitted him, yea, a meer scandal stinking in the no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">thrils of moral men. 3. Whither if it were but a defect, it were not a <HI>wilful</HI> one, since they either had, or might have had, an account of the Churches proceedings with him; and ought to have inquired after the true cause of his Excommunication, before they received him. Well, it was but a little fault, and a little amendment was enough: and what was that? <HI>when clamors were revived and re|newed:</HI>] and then to speak of open and notorious wickedness, if it be approved by a society of An baptists, is <HI>Clamour.</HI> But it's well a clamour roused them; whom serious warnings and informations could not.
