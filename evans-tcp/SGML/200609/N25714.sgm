<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pages are given to the world by a &s;on, who&s;e filial affection may perhaps have in|duced him to entertain too high an opinion of the merit of his father's productions; but who candid|ly owns, his motives to the publication were, a con|viction that the work is calculated to afford con&s;i|derable amu&s;ement and in&s;truction, and a warm de|&s;ire to re&s;cue the memory of a father from oblivion.</P>
<P>Though to all they may not appear in the light in which they do to me, as precious memorials of that wit and poetical genius which once animated the brea&s;t of him who is now forever laid in the &s;ilent tomb, and who once was the delight of his friends and family; yet many, I hope, when they read this work, will remember a departed friend, and mourn the lo&s;s of the man while they enjoy the humour of the poet. All I tru&s;t will here find abundant &s;ubjects of merri|ment and diver&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="034158_0004_0FFC8473D57B5808">The author appears to have thoroughly under&s;tood the true points of ridicule in human characters, and to have drawn them with great accuracy and variety in his comedies. The piece entitled, The Candidates, is intended to laugh to &s;corn the practice of corrup|tion, and fal&s;ehood; of which too many are guilty in electioneering; to teach our countrymen to de&s;pi&s;e the arts of tho&s;e who meanly attempt to influence their votes by any thing but merit.&mdash;The play of the Patriots is a picture of real and pretended patriots; by which the reader may perceive the difference between them, may learn to honour and reward the true, and to treat the fal&s;e with infamy and con|tempt. If any con&s;truction &s;hould be put upon it as a &s;atire on the conduct of America in the late re|volution, the whole tenour of the author's political conduct will exempt him from the imputation of &s;uch an intention. He entered warmly into the prin|ciples of the friends of America, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oldly fought in her defence, and proved his attachment to her cau&s;e not by words only, but by deeds. The play it&s;elf al&s;o &s;peaks a different language; and evidently proves it was written in ridicule of political hypo|crites, and not of the true friends of their country.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the other poems, I believe the tran&s;lation of Ovid will be found to be very correct
<PB N="vii" REF="034158_0005_0FFC8472521F9278">
and highly poetical. The author intended, if he had lived, to tran&s;late the whole work, but death put an end to his de&s;ign. The &s;maller poems I &s;ubmit to the reader, without &s;aying any thing of their merit, as I wi&s;h not to fore&s;tall a plea&s;ure, or to rai&s;e too great expectations.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;hort ob&s;ervations, gentle reader, I bid thee adieu; with a &s;incere wi&s;h that the work before thee may afford thee rational amu&s;ement.</P>

<P>Sir John Toddy is below, and if your ho|nour is at lei&s;ure, would beg to &s;peak to you.</P>

<P>Very well, I am obliged to you, Sir John.

<P>No, &s;ir, upon my honour, &s;ir, it was punctually to know how your lady and family did, &s;ir, 'pon honour, &s;ir, it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had better be more &s;paring of your honour at pre&s;ent, Sir John; for, if you are a candi|date, whenever you make promi&s;es to the people that you can't comply with, you mu&s;t &s;ay upon ho|nour, otherwi&s;e they won't believe you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such conde&s;cen&s;ion from you, Sir John, I have no rea&s;on to expect: you have my hearty con&s;ent to do as you plea&s;e, and if the people choo&s;e you their Repre&s;entative, I mu&s;t accept of you as a colleague.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a colleague, Mr. Wou'dbe! I was thinking you did not intend to &s;tand a poll, and my bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ir, was to get the favour of you to &s;peak a good word for me among the people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you have no occa&s;ion for a trum|peter, Sir John? If you have, I'll &s;peak a good word to you, and advi&s;e you to decline.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. Wou'dbe, after you declin'd, I thought I was the next <HI>fittene&s;t</HI> man in the county,
<PB N="15" REF="034158_0012_0FFC8461869A1FE0">
and Mr. Wou'dbe, if you would be ungenerous, tho' you are a laughing man, you would tell me &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be ungenerous indeed, Sir John, to tell you what the people could never be induced to believe. But I'll be ingenuous enough to tell you, Sir John, if you expect any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me, you'll be di&s;appointed, for I can't think you the <HI>fit|tene&s;t</HI> man I know.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, &s;ir, who do you know be&s;ides? Perhaps I may be thought as fit as your honour. But, &s;ir, if you are for that, the harde&s;t fend off: damn me, if I care a farthing for you; and &s;o, your &s;ervant, &s;ir.
<STAGE>Exit Sir John.</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, I have got the old knight, and his friend Guzzle, I &s;uppo&s;e, again&s;t me, by &s;peaking &s;o freely; but their intere&s;t, I believe, has not weight enough among the people, for me to lo&s;e any thing, by making them my enemies. Indeed, the being in|timate with &s;uch a fool as Sir John, might tend more to my di&s;credit with them, for the people of Virginia have too much &s;en&s;e not to perceive how weak the head mu&s;t be that is always filled with liquor.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>MR. Trueman, I am happy to &s;ee you. In times like the&s;e, of war and danger, almo&s;t every man is &s;u&s;picious even of his friend; but with you I may conver&s;e with the utmo&s;t confidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Meanwell, I know your heart, and am &s;orry that any man can &s;u&s;pect its purity; but our ca&s;e is much the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? are you too accu&s;ed of toryi&s;m?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am indeed. Unfortunately, I have &s;ome enemies who have rai&s;ed the cry again&s;t me. And what is wor&s;e, I fear the con&s;equences will be &s;erious, and a little uncommon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will be bad indeed if they cau&s;e the lo&s;s of the girl I love. To your friendly bo&s;om I may tru&s;t the &s;ecrets of my heart. The lovely Mira, daughter of our old neighbour Brazen has won my affections. You know her beauteous form; but that is but an image of her &s;oul, its more charming inhabi|tant. I had &s;een and loved her: her father declared his approbation of my pa&s;&s;ion, and encouraged me to proceed. Heaven &s;eemed to promi&s;e me &s;ucce&s;s, and the idol of my &s;oul had with blu&s;hing tenderne&s;s con|&s;ented
<PB N="56" REF="034158_0052_0FFC8405786D53E8">
to be my bride. But all our hopes may pro|bably be bla&s;ted by this unfortunate circum&s;tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot be doubted. Her father is a vio|lent patriot without knowing the meaning of the word. He under&s;tands little or nothing beyond a dice-box and race-field, but thinks he knows every thing; and woe be to him that contradicts him! His politi|cal notions are a &s;y&s;tem of perfect anarchy, but he reigns in his own family with perfect de&s;poti&s;m. He is fully re&s;olved that nobody &s;hall tyrannize over him, but very content to tyrannize over others. I happened in conver&s;ation to oppo&s;e &s;ome of his doc|tines of a &s;tate of nature and liberty without re&s;traint, and he blazed out immediately like a fla&s;h of gun|powder. I endeavored to moderate his anger; but as rea&s;on and he can never be reconciled, I am afraid my &s;ins will never be forgiven; be&s;ides, I have a bit|ter enemy and rival in Captain Fla&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that is the drawcan&s;ir of modern times; a fellow who pretends to cat the &s;moke of a cannon fre&s;h from the mouth, and to kill all the enemies of his country, as Caligula would the Roman people, at one blow. But I believe he's a coward at bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I. But Old Brazen is per&s;uaded that not even Wa&s;hington is his parallel. As I pretend not to extravagant valour, the captain thinks me a puny milk&s;op, and judges it very great pre&s;umption in me to pretend to the lady he adores. I expect he has a&s;&s;i&s;ted the old man's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t me; and, by his a&s;&s;ertions, convinced him I am a tory:&mdash; But this is certain, the old gentleman declared that I
<PB N="57" REF="034158_0053_0FFC84033142A438">
&s;hould never enter his doors with his con&s;ent again, and moreover has commanded his daughter to think no more of having me for her hu&s;band.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a pity it is that all heads are not ca|pable of receiving the benign influence of the princi|ples of liberty&mdash;&s;ome are too weak to bear it, and be|come thoroughly intoxicated. The cau&s;e of my coun|try appears as dear to me as to tho&s;e who mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionately declaim on the &s;ubject. The rays of the &s;un of freedom, which is now ri&s;ing, have warmed my heart; but I hope my zeal again&s;t tyranny will not be &s;hewn by bawling again&s;t it, but by &s;erving my country again&s;t her enemies; and never may I &s;ig|nalize my attachment to liberty by per&s;ecuting inno|cent men, only becau&s;e they differ in opinion with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems for this very rea&s;on you are not ac|counted a patriot; but truth will at la&s;t prevail, the faithful heart be applauded, and the noi&s;y hypocrite &s;tripped of the ma&s;k of patrioti&s;m.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope &s;o; and therefore truth, plain truth, &s;hall be the only &s;hield I will u&s;e again&s;t my foes. Men who aim at power without merit, mu&s;t conceal the meanne&s;s of their &s;ouls by noi&s;y and pa&s;&s;ionate &s;peeches in favour of every thing which is the cur|rent opinion of the day; but real patriots are mild, and &s;ecretly anxious for their country, but mode&s;t in expre&s;&s;ions of zeal. They are indu&s;trious in the pub|lic &s;ervice, but claim no glory to them&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>May the armies of America be always led by &s;uch as the&s;e! Thus will the power of Britain be
<PB N="58" REF="034158_0054_0FFC8400F2A243D8">
overthrown, and peace with liberty return&mdash;May men like the&s;e conduct our government, and happi|ne&s;s, in the train of independence, will ble&s;s the &s;mil|ing land! But before this can be accompli&s;hed many temporary evils mu&s;t be &s;upported with patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and this under which we now labour among the re&s;t. But what do you propo&s;e to do in the ca&s;e of your lovely Mira? you won't give up the pur&s;uit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give up the pur&s;uit? When I do, may I be hanged as a traitor to love! But it &s;eems a little dif|ficult at pre&s;ent. I have taken the liberty to u&s;e your &s;ervant already in the bu&s;ine&s;s. As he very lately came into this part of the country, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a ve|ry genteel air, I thought he might ea&s;ily pa&s;s for a gentleman with old Brazen. I equip'd him there|fore as an officer, and &s;ent him to the hou&s;e of the old gentleman; and ordered him to pa&s;s him&s;elf for a travelling captain, and to wait for an opportunity of delivering a letter to Mira. He executed the com|mi&s;&s;ion with fidelity, and brought me an an&s;wer from her, in which &s;he communicates to me all that I have told you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do you intend to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your permi&s;&s;ion I'll make u&s;e of your &s;ervant upon a &s;econd emba&s;&s;y.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means; but what do you propo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the pur&s;uit of honorable love few things are reprehen&s;ible. I &s;hall intreat her to elope with me into a neighbouring government, where Hymen &s;hall make us one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="59" REF="034158_0055_0FFC83FEAAD9ECC8">

</SP>

Little did I expect this re&s;i&s;tance in &s;o artle&s;s a crea|ture. I made as &s;ure of my game, as if I had caught it. However, I'll entangle my pretty linnet yet, in a net often &s;et by us true &s;port&s;men, for the&s;e &s;hy birds. Our butler &s;hall be the par&s;on, the cook and &s;cul|lion the witne&s;&s;es. The butler has a mo&s;t demure &s;anctified face, and will make a tolerable good prie&s;t. E'gad, the idea of what is to follow, gives me a pal|pitation at the heart already. Well, Trueman, your bu&s;ine&s;s: then my own.

<P>My old friend, Mr. Worthy, writes me that his nephew, George, had arrived from England, about the beginning of our public di&s;turbances; that being too free in di&s;covering his political opinions, he was cited before one of their courts. To avoid the treatment he expected to receive from the&s;e guardians of the rights and liberties of their fellow-citizens, he ab&s;conded without informing his friends of his route or de&s;igns. I am reque&s;ted to make en|quiry after him. We have no a&s;ylum with us to which per&s;ecuted integrity would fly for &s;helter. No, no, he is not with us.</P>

That young man is out of the way at a very improper time, and may probably have &s;ome trick in view. He appears to be a faithful and hone&s;t, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t ingenious and genteel &s;ervant, I ever &s;aw; but neverthele&s;s, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but he may have a mixture of the rake in his di&s;po&s;ition.

without any wedding in reality; the butler &s;aid as how he did not approve &s;uch doings, and he would endeavour to let you know in time to prevent it.&mdash; How&s;omdever, as he is gone too, without telling your honour any thing about it, I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Pickle may have overper&s;uaded him.</P>

<P>Melinda Heartfree, &s;ir, the daughter of your honour's old &s;ervant John.

Indeed, your honour, I think it would be a pity to do her any harm.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>I applaud your &s;entiments, and wi&s;h that many in higher &s;tations, who delight in betraying innocence and beauty, could think as ju&s;tly.

<L>Then &s;tep'd a&s;ide, to li&s;ten, as &s;he &s;pake.</L>
<L>He vow'd to love, with &s;weet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &s;wore,</L>
<L>But haple&s;s Celia ne'er may view him o'er.</L>
<L>Her moving words the balmy breezes bear,</L>
<L>And gently waft them to the &s;hepherd's ear.</L>
<L>Each &s;oothing &s;ound his deep attention caught,</L>
<L>But Celia's name enraptur'd ev'ry thought&mdash;</L>
<L>When &s;moothly gliding thro' the &s;ilent grove,</L>
<L>She &s;aw her Colin melting into love,</L>
<L>"<HI>His &s;oul thus utt'rance gave.</HI>"</L>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL>
<L>Why dubious, Celia, of thy Colin's love,</L>
<L>And why lamenting to the &s;ilent grove?</L>
<L>In early youth your plea&s;ing chains I bore,</L>
<L>And captive &s;till, my lovely maid, adore.</L>
<L>Should Venus, circled in an orb of charms,</L>
<L>With &s;weet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion court me to her arms,</L>
<L>Her all-divine would ineffectual prove,</L>
<L>Nor cou'd her beauty make me change my love.</L>
<L>"<HI>She blu&s;h'd and &s;mil'd.</HI>"</L>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL>
<L>Then Colin's eyes with &s;parkling plea&s;ure roll,</L>
<L>A torrent rapture ru&s;hing to his &s;oul.</L>
<L>He &s;miling &s;prings, in tran&s;port, views her charms,</L>
<L>And cla&s;ps her gently yielding in his arms.</L>
