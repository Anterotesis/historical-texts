<HEAD>To their Excellencys, THE Lords Ju&s;tices OF ENGLAND The Humble MEMORIAL of <HI>Chidley Brook</HI> &amp; <HI>William Nicolls,</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THat they were &s;ent from the Governour, Council and General A&s;&s;embly of His Majesties Province of <HI>New-York</HI> about the Month of <HI>November</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, with an humble Addre&s;s of Thanks to His Sacred Maje&s;ty, for his Royal Care of and Bounty to that Province, with all dutiful Acknowledgment of their hearty Affection and Zeal to His Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Government.</P>
<P>That they had al&s;o Commi&s;&s;ion and In&s;tructions to lay before his Maje&s;ty the State and Condition of that Province, in relation to the War with the French; and further, to move and appear in any matter or thing that may conduce to the Good and Wellfare of that Province.</P>
<P>That being on heir Voyage hither, in the Month of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t, near the I&s;lands of <HI>Silly,</HI> they were taken by a Privateer of <HI>St Malo,</HI> and carried into France, where they remained Pri&s;oners till the beginning of the Month of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039317_0002_10141D8F266F9D68">That when they found the Ship they were in was not capable of any longer Defence, they &s;unk all &s;uch Papers and Writings as did any ways concern the Publick or the War.</P>
<P>That they were in&s;tructed humbly to offer to and acquaint His Maje&s;ty, That the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> have Re-&s;ettled a Fort at a place called <HI>Cadaraque,</HI> from whence they were driven by the Indians, the beginning of the War.</P>
<P>That &s;ince the &s;aid Settlement, the Indians of the five Nations have &s;eemed much colder in their Friend&s;hip to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and it is to be feared, they will not only &s;trike up a Peace with the <HI>French,</HI> but make open War upon the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>That it has not been po&s;&s;ible for the Governour of <HI>New-York,</HI> with the Forces he has there, to hinder the &s;ettlement of the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Cadaraque,</HI> it being &s;cituate more than Five Hundred Miles from the uppermo&s;t Plantations, and the way thither through a Country of thick Woods and great Lakes, without any Road, and where no Provi&s;ions for any con&s;ider|able Party of Chri&s;tians are to be had.</P>
<P>That if tho&s;e Five Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould be drawn over to the <HI>French,</HI> all the Engli&s;h Plantations on the Main Land, that are &s;ettled at great di&s;tance from one another, will be liable to be wholly Ruined and De&s;troyed by &s;mall Parties of <HI>French</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>That the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> by its Scituation, yearly Pre&s;ents and A&s;&s;i&s;tance given to tho&s;e Indians, (to the great Impoveri&s;hing of that Country) has hitherto (except any Defection has happened &s;ince <HI>November</HI> la&s;t) with great diffi|culty kept tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> from quitting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>That in that Province, con&s;i&s;ting of about three Thou&s;and Families, towards the defraying the Charge of the War, has been rai&s;ed, &s;ince the year 1690. above 30000 <HI>l.</HI> and all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance had from the Neighbouring Colonies, has only been about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> though all the <HI>Engli&s;h Plantations</HI> on the Continent are equally (if not more) concerned in the danger.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="039317_0003_10141D93B96AE210">That notwith&s;tanding &s;o much Money has been rai&s;ed from that Province, and the other A&s;&s;i&s;tance given by its Neighbours, the Expence of the War has been &s;o great, that the Government at pre&s;ent remains much in debt, and will not be longer able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s &s;ome effectual Methods are found to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Indians</HI> being weary of the War, ob&s;erving the great Recruits of Men, Arms and Stores yearly &s;ent from <HI>France,</HI> are very &s;en&s;ible of the Danger threatned them by the Neighbourhood of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Cadaraque,</HI> who are much better fortified there than formerly; and by this they are inclined to hearken to the Propo&s;als made from tho&s;e of <HI>Canada,</HI> who by Menaces, Gifts, and other means, endeavour to get tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> to engage on their &s;ide.</P>
<P>They humbly therefore pray Your Lord&s;hips to Intercede with His Maje&s;ty, To order &s;ome &s;peedy and effectual Care to be taken, that the Evils, which apparently will attend the <HI>Indians</HI> Confederating with the <HI>French,</HI> and their &s;ettling in tho&s;e Parts may be prevented.</P>
