To the INHABITANTS of ANNE-ARUNDEL county.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are reque&s;ted to meet at the city of Annapolis, on Monday the 16th in&s;tant, to nominate deputies to attend, on behalf of this county, at the next provincial con|vention, and to chu&s;e a committee of ob&s;ervation; permit me to offer to your con|&s;ideration, the rea&s;ons, which induce me to &s;olicit your attendance on that day. The incon|venience ari&s;ing from the &s;ea&s;on of the year, I am &s;atisfied, will not prevent you, if convin|ced, that your duty to your country requires your attendance. You have always di&s;tingui&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;elve<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> cau&s;e of liberty, and never been exceeded by any county, in zeal and public &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Your liberty and happine&s;s, and that of your po&s;terity, depend on the event of the pre|&s;ent &s;truggle with the Briti&s;h mini&s;try: they &s;eem determined to make you &s;laves, you are re&s;olved to be free: the American congre&s;s has pointed out the means of pre&s;erving free|dom: a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of your trade;&mdash;and the nece&s;&s;ary preparations to enable you to repel force by force, if that &s;hould be employed to &s;ubvert your rights and liberties: the&s;e are the means recommended by the united opinion and advice of America. The freedom of mil|lions, the political &s;alvation of all Briti&s;h America, can only be &s;ecured by executing with fi|delity and re&s;olution the advice of the congre&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;trict compliance with the a&s;&s;ociation and re&s;olves of our late provincial convention, d|pends in great mea&s;ure on a prudent and wi&s;e choice of your committee of ob&s;ervation: I would recommend it to con&s;i&s;t of a con&s;iderable number of gentlemen of the be&s;t under&s;tand|ing, fortune, and influence in the county, without any regard to profe&s;&s;ion, religion, or re&s;i|dence; men able to &s;peak your &s;en&s;e on any que&s;tion, and to who&s;e re&s;olutions you would wi&s;h to give that weight, which their utility, and the public good might require.</P>
<P>The appointment of deputies, to repre&s;ent this county, at the next convention, in April; which will not be held, if American grievances &s;hould in the mean time be redre&s;&s;ed, appears to me of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, and to demand your mo&s;t deliberate attention: If the Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;hould continue deaf to our complaints, and to the voice of rea&s;on, of policy, and ju&s;tice, and and &s;hould determine to enforce, at all events, its arbitrary decrees, how dreadful would be our &s;ituation, in the mid&s;t of all the horrors and calamities of civil war! We &s;corn, we reject with contempt, the ba&s;e humiliating conditions of &s;lavery&mdash;We are determined to re&s;i&s;t even unto death, to &s;ave our country, or bravely peri&s;h in her ruins. If American griev|ances &s;hould not be redre&s;&s;ed (and I fear they will not) que&s;tions of &s;uch a magnitude and difficulty <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> ari&s;e, as to require the united wi&s;dom, knowledge, and fortitude of this province. Your virtue will then be put to a &s;evere trial&mdash;Con&s;ider then with attention, the nature and importance of the tru&s;t, and to whom you delegate your power at this very critical and alarming cri&s;is of your affairs.&mdash;You never were called on to exerci&s;e your great con&s;titutional right of electing your repre&s;entatives, at a time which required more judgment in your choice. I would recommend but one <HI>TEST&mdash;an hone&s;t man with ability and re&s;olu|tion.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>"The Congre&s;s thought them&s;elves bound in duty to ob&s;erve to the colonies, that the &s;chemes agitated again&s;t them had been &s;o conducted as to render it prudent, <HI>that they &s;hould extend their views to the mo&s;t unhappy events, and be in all re&s;pects prepared for every contingency.</HI>" The nece&s;&s;ary means of preparation were left to each province, as be&s;t acquainted with their own peculiar circum&s;tances.&mdash;Your deputies met in provincial convention were of opinion, that a well regulated militia is the natural &s;trength and only &s;table &s;ecurity of a free government, and <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> recommended to the freemen of this province to form them&s;elves into companies, chu&s;e their officers, learn the military exerci&s;e, be pro|vided with arms and ammunition, in readine&s;s to act on any emergency, and to rai&s;e money for the purcha&s;e of arms and ammunition: They entreated, they conjured every man by his duty to God, his country, and his po&s;terity, cordially to unite in defence of our common rights and liberties. I want no argument to convince me of the immediate nece&s;&s;ity of putting this province in a po&s;ture of defence. If any one &s;hould object to the mea&s;ure, I would an&s;wer, THE CONGRESS ADVISED IT:&mdash;<HI>The deputies of all the counties of this province unanimou&s;ly recommended it</HI>: The fir&s;t with me is &s;ufficient, the latter conclu&s;ive: The deputies were gentlemen of the fir&s;t fortunes, ability, and knowledge, well acquainted with our circum&s;tances, and undoubtedly &s;poke the &s;en&s;e of the whole province. The private opinions of &s;ome few indi|viduals, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pectable for integrity of character, &s;oundne&s;s of judgement, and their at|tachment to the cau&s;e of America, ought to have little weight in oppo&s;ition to the advice of the continental congre&s;s, and the recommendation of your own provincial convention.</P>
<P>I have not the lea&s;t doubt that this county will inviolably ob&s;erve and execute the a&s;&s;ocia|tion, and the re&s;olves of the province: I que&s;tion not but a very great majority of you will form your&s;elves into a militia, and liberally contribute for the purcha&s;e of arms and ammuni|tion. Every man is bound to &s;erve his country; all are obliged, or none. Every man is bound to contribute his endeavours to advance and &s;ecure the general good. This county is called
<PB REF="013816_0002_0F91EC5B0D11DEF8">
on by the province to rai&s;e &pound;. 866, for the purcha&s;e of arms and ammunition. Every man then in this county is bound to contribute in &s;ome proportion to the property which he holds, and the more his property is worth, the more he ought to pay for the &s;ecurity of it. But there are a few among you (I rejoice but a few) who, in this time of public danger and cala|mity, &s;eparate them&s;elves from their country, and though ble&s;&s;ed with very ample fortunes, refu&s;e, or decline, to contribute any part thereof, to the &s;upport of the public cau&s;e, or to unite in defence of our common rights and liberties.&mdash;Our convention in June recommended contributions for the &s;upport of our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren in Bo&s;ton; not one farth<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> was given by the &s;ame gentlemen; a congre&s;s was deemed proper to collect the &s;en&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ame per&s;ons did not contribute to the &s;upport of your delegates: the congre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the colonies to arm in defence of their liberties; your late convention <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> recommended a militia, and &s;ub&s;criptions to rai&s;e money for the purcha&s;e of arms and ammunition; the &s;ame men, per&s;evering in the &s;ame line of conduct, have declined to comply with either of the requi&s;itions; they withdraw their per&s;ons and their fortunes from the &s;ervice of their country: but they are as much intere&s;ted, and have as deep a &s;take to lo&s;e as any other men in the province; they, and their po&s;terity are to enjoy, with you, all advantages ari&s;ing from the &s;ucce&s;s of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t with Great-Britain; they mu&s;t be involved with you in all the con&s;equences of a &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubjection; liberty procured by you will be equally enjoyed by them; &s;lavery fixed on you will be equally intailed on them and their po&s;terity.&mdash;If &s;uch indeed was their &s;ituation, it would be difficult to account for their conduct.&mdash;In truth, if Ame|rica &s;ucceeds, they will be benefitted as much as any men in the province, without contributing any part of their property, without any ri&s;que of forfeitures, and with &s;afety to their per&s;ons; their pre&s;ent behaviour may entitle them to the protection of the mini&s;try. If we fail, they will po&s;|&s;e&s;s their e&s;tates, and enjoy their offices; promotion may reward their pre&s;ent conduct, and their re&s;entment may be gratified by &s;eeing &s;ome of your be&s;t and firme&s;t friends, executed as re|bels and traitors.&mdash;Such is the double, crafty, and, in their opinion, &s;ecure game played by &s;ome few among you. Place, therefore, no confidence in &s;uch men, view them as foes to the rights of Briti&s;h America, let their names be publi&s;hed to the world, that they may be uni|ver&s;ally contemned, as the enemies of American liberty; let them be the object of your con|tempt, but let them not feel the force of your re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude without once more earne&s;tly reque&s;ting a full meeting of the county: numbers will command re&s;pect, and give weight to your re&s;olutions.</P>
