<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GARDENING at the perfection to which it has been advanced, in many parts of the world, is entitled to a place of considerable rank among the liberal Arts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As there is no doubt that with care and attenti|on, almost every species of vegetables may be propa|gated in this climate to as great perfection as in any part of the universe; it is to be hoped that every improvement which can possibly be suggested, in the infant state of Horticulture in this country, will meet with every possible degree of encouragement; more especially when we call to mind the many ne|cessaries and conveniencies of life which are derived to us from the produce of the garden; and how su|perabundantly the assiduous labourer is here reward|ed by the exuberance of vegetation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Under such persuasion, and from the repeated so|licitations of many reputable characters in this and the adjoining States,</HI> R. SQUIBB&punc; <HI>has been induced to submit to the perusal of the Public the following Epitom of</HI> GARDENING, <HI>which is founded on expe|rience and observation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This being his first Essay, he flatters himself that the candid Public will overlook any trifling mistake or inaccuracy that may possibly occur to their notice; and the more so, as his attention (since the com|mencement of the undertaking) has been greatly di|verted,
<PB REF="020722_0005_0FB0E3A921C48FD0">
through the urgent application of his friends, to the pursuit of his manual profession; and his fee|ble efforts in the intervals only have been exerted to point out, in a plain, concise and familiar man|ner, the most beneficial rules (to the utmost of his practice, knowledge and abilities) peculiarly adapt|ed to the climate, and most agreeable to the ge|neral system of Horticulture, throughout every mouth in the year&mdash;in doing of which be candidly acknow|ledges to have followed, as much as possible, the method and style of a justly admired European Gard|ener.</HI></P>
<P><HI>However mysterious some propositions in this work may appear to his readers respecting foreign seeds, and some other deviations from the usual practice, which the variation of climate makes necessary; let them be assured, that what is here laid down, has been the result of much experience, which no theori|cal ideas can confute&mdash;he having studied with atten|tion, the soils and seasons, best calculated for sowing and planting the most useful vegetables, &amp;c. adapt|ed for, or peculiar to this country.</HI></P>

THE Gardener's Calendar FOR South-Carolina, Georgia, and North-Carolina:</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="month">
<HEAD>JANUARY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="type of garden">
<HEAD>Work to be done in the Kitchen Garden.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>BEANS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of this month, if the wea|ther is open, let some ground be got ready for a principal crop of broad beans. The best sorts are&mdash;</P>
<P>The windsor bean, sandwich bean, toker bean, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The windsor bean is an excellent sort, and may be planted the first week in this month; also the toker, which is very fine&punc; and a good bearer. Let the rows be four
<PB N="2" REF="020722_0009_0FB0E3B2C5487678">
feet distant from each other; and set the beans either with a blunt ended dibble, two or three inches deep, or drill them that depth; and about five or six inches asunder in the rows.</P>
<P>If you have not planted any mazagon and long podded beans before this month; let some of the two sorts be planted as early as possible&mdash;you may plant the mazagon, long podded, and windsor beans all at the same time; and they will succeed each other in bearing.</P>
<P>The mazagon bean should be planted in rows two feet asunder, and four inches dis|tant in the rows; and the long pods two feet and a half or three feet from row to row, and six or seven inches in the row.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>PEAS.</HEAD>
<P>Let some early hotspur peas be sown the beginning of this month for a full crop, in a warm piece of ground, to succeed the same sorts sown in the two last months&mdash;the sorts are&mdash;</P>
<P>Charleton, hotspur, golden hotspur, Essex hotspur, &amp;c. but the two first are the earliest, and the other&punc; is proper to succeed them; sow each sort in rows four feet asunder; if the ground is rich, and you intend to set sticks for their support&mdash;but, if you do not intend to give them sticks; three feet will be sufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="020722_0010_0FB0E3B466FD6260">
At the same time also you may sow the first crop of marrowfat peas, and they will succeed the hotspur, for they will come into bearing as the others go off. This pea is much admired in most families&punc; but the dwarf marrowfat is the properest for sowing at this season; observing, if you intend to set sticks for those peas to run upon, to sow them in rows five feet distant from each other&mdash;but, if no sticks are intended, three feet and a half will afford space enough.</P>
<P>If you have pease and beans, already ad|vanced two or three inches high or more, take the advantage of a fine day, when the surface of the ground is dry, and draw some earth up to their stems.</P>
<P>This should not be omitted; for it will strengthen the plants, and protect them great|ly against the frost and wind.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>CABBAGES</HEAD>
<P>About the beginning, middle, or any time in this month, you may sow early York, su|gar-loaf and drum-head cabbage-seed, to come in for summer use&mdash;for this purpose, chuse a warm border, under a wall or fence&mdash;Dig the ground a spade deep, throw it up into a bed or beds, sow the seed pretty thick, and rake the surface even&mdash;should severe weather set in, you may throw a little light litter or straw over the beds, before or after the plants are up.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="020722_0011_0FB0E3BB750B25B8">
If your cabbage-plants, sown in October or November, were not transplanted last month, let them be put out soon in this. Let the ground be well manured with good rotten dung, and dig it in a full spade deep, if the land will bear it. Rake the ground smooth, and plant your drumhead or large cabbage plants two feet and a half distant from row to row, and the same distance in the rows....[See December.]</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>CAULIFLOWERS.</HEAD>
<P>Let every care be taken to protect your cauliflowers from frost&mdash;This may be done by binding moss or hay bands round the stems, and about one third of the leaves, and tying the leaves together near the tops.</P>
<P>About the middle of this month, you may transplant the cauliflowers sown in October, if they are of full size to transplant. Let these plants be put out into a warm situa|tion, and in a spot of rich soil well manur|ed with good rotten dung; and plant them about two feet and a half distant from row to row, and two feet in the rows.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>BROCCOLI.</HEAD>
<P>Let your broccoli have frequent hoeings; and let the decayed leaves be taken away as they fall off, which are no ways pleasing to the eye.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<PB N="5" REF="020722_0012_0FB0E3BD49BA18D8">
<HEAD>TURNIPS.</HEAD>
<P>About the latter end of this month, sow a few dutch turnips, for an early crop&mdash;if they succeed they will come in about the beginning of April, and will be exceeding good.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>BEETS.</HEAD>
<P>Sow beets about the latter end of this month, of different sorts, the red beet for a large root, and the green and white sorts, for their leaves in soup, stewing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Beet seed being pretty large it is an eligible method, either to sow it in drills, in order that it may be more regularly buried in the earth, at an equal depth; or to dot it in with a blunt ended dibble in rows&mdash;Let the drills be drawn with a hoe, about an inch and a half deep, and ten or twelve inches asunder&mdash;Divide the ground into beds five feet wide, put three or four seeds into each hole, and cover them in as you go on; and after the plants are come up some time, leave only one of the strongest in each hole.</P>
<P>It will be most proper to sow the red and the other sorts separate; for it is the root of the red sort only that is used; and the leaves of the white and green kinds.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<PB N="6" REF="020722_0013_0FB0E3BEB75C41A8">
<HEAD>CARROTS.</HEAD>
<P>When the weather is mild and dry, at any time in this month, let a warm spot of ground be prepared for a few early carrots&mdash;Dig the ground a full spade deep, and break the earth well as you go on.</P>
<P>This is only intended for a few to come in a little before the general crop; therefore only a small piece of ground should be pre|pared for this purpose&mdash;Choose a dry mild day to sow the feed; and you may sow a thin sprinkling of radishes with the carrots; and let them be raked in soon; always ob|serving to divide the ground into beds from four to five feet in width.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>ONIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Let your onions have frequent hoeings; and let the surface of the ground be con|stantly kept loose, which will greatly pro|mote their growth.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>SPINAGE.</HEAD>
<P>On a small spot of ground you may sow a little spinage, to come early in the spring, at which time it will be very acceptable in most families; the smooth-leaved or round seeded is the best to sow at this season.</P>
<P>The seed may be sown about the middle or toward the latter end of this month, either in the broad cast, and raked in; or in broad, flat, shallow drills, drawn with a hoe flat|ways,
<PB N="7" REF="020722_0014_0FB0E3C0D1B40738">
about an inch deep, and a foot asun|der; or you may sow it in drills between rows of early beans and peas.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>PARSLEY.</HEAD>
<P>Sow some parsley seed in open weather, about the middle or towards the end of this month.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of parsley, the com|mon plain, and curl-leaved, but the latter is greatly to be prefered; the leaves being large, thick, and bushy, and excellent for culinary uses, and much admired for garnish to dishes. Let shallow drills be drawn in a dry part of the garden, and sow the seeds therein pretty thick, and cover them about half an inch deep with earth.</P>
<P>These seeds may be sown in a single drill round the edges of the kitchen garden quar|ters, or along the edges of the borders next the paths&mdash;This seed lies in the ground some|times a month or six weeks before it makes its appearance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>LETTUCES.</HEAD>
<P>Transplant some more lettuces from the beds or borders where they stand too close together&mdash;In doing this, observe to draw the plants out regularly, and let the strongest remain in the bed or border ten or twelve inches distance; then loosen the surface of
<PB N="8" REF="020722_0015_0FB0E3C28BF7B0B0">
the earth with a hoe, and clear away the weeds and litter.</P>
<P>The plants which are taken out, should be planted in a warm border of rich earth, at ten or twelve inches distance each way; and if the weather is dry let them have a lit|tle water.</P>
<P>Cabbage, Silesia, and Dutch brown lettuce may be sown at any time in this month in a sheltered situation, in a spot of light rich earth, open to the sun.</P>
<P>Pick off all dead and decayed leaves as they appear on the plants, and keep them perfectly clear of weeds; and if you stir the surface of the earth between the plants some|times it will be of service to them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>CELLERY.</HEAD>
<P>When the weather is open take the advan|tage of a dry day to earth up such cellery as require it.</P>
<P>Let the earth be well broken and laid up to the plants lightly, that they may not be crushed down or bruised, raising the earth near to the top of the plants; should severe frost set in, it will injure part of the tops of the plants that are above ground; and if much of the plants should be out of ground in such weather, and be thereby destroyed, it will also occasion a decay of those parts that are within the ground&mdash;Therefore it may
<PB N="9" REF="020722_0016_0FB0E3C4417D35D8">
be necessary to cover the rows with long litter, straw, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>ENDIVE.</HEAD>
<P>In dry open weather let some of the full grown endive be prepared for blanching&mdash;take the opportunity of a fine day, when the plants are quite dry, and tie the leaves of each plant together; and with a small hoe draw up some earth round them seperately, to assist their whitening, and to protect them more effectually from the frost&mdash;They will be blanched for use in a fortnight proper for sallads, soup, stewing, &amp;c. [For further in|formation see December.]</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>GARLICK &amp; SHALOTS.</HEAD>
<P>If your garlick or shalots are not already planted, the business should be no longer omitted. &mdash; [See October.]</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>RADISHES.</HEAD>
<P>In the beginning, or any time this month when the weather is open and mild, sow some short top radishes for an early crop, on a warm border that lies well to the sun, un|der a wall or fence&mdash;and about the latter end you may sow the same sort, and some salmon radishes, to succeed them.</P>
<P>You should not mix both sorts together, but let each sort be sown by itself, for the short top will come in ten or twelve days
<PB N="10" REF="020722_0017_0FB0E3C807ADBA90">
sooner than the salmon radishes; and the short top are much more hardy than the salmon&mdash;</P>
<P>The surest method is to sow some short top at least twice or oftner in this month&mdash;therefore if you sow some about the beginning, and again at the middle, and towards the lat|ter end of the month, in a warm situation you will seldom fail of success.</P>
<P>There may be mixed and sown with the radishes a sprinkling of carrot seed; for if the radishes should fail, the carrots may succeed; and if both succeed, there will be a double advantage&mdash;for when the radishes are drawn off for use, there remains a crop of carrots, which will come in at an early period; or, instead of carrots, you may sow a little lettuce seed or round spinnage, and when the radish|es are gone off these will come in.</P>
<P>You should sow your radish seeds pretty thick at this season; for when the radish seeds begin to appear, if the weather should prove sharp&punc; it will cut some off, and the birds too will be apt to attack them and destroy many; sow the seeds regularly over the surface, and throw the ground up into beds, about four or four feet and a half wide, and rake the surface even, standing in the alleys&mdash;Should there be any appearance of frost after the seed is sown, it will be proper to spread some dry straw or litter over the surface, an inch or two thick; which will keep the surface

<HEAD>HORSE RADISH.</HEAD>
<P>This plant is propagated by cuttings, ei|ther taken off the top an inch or two long,
<PB N="12" REF="020722_0019_0FB0E3CBB41BEB88">
or from the old roots cut in pieces of that length&mdash;but the top or crown of the plant is most preferable. The method is this &mdash;</P>
<P>First procure a quantity of proper sets;&mdash;which may be either the small off-sets that arise from the sides of the main roots, of which take cuttings off their tops, an inch or two long; or you may use the tops of the crowns of the old roots, when taken up for use: or in default of a sufficiency of crowns or tops of either, you may divide a quantity of old knotty roots into cuttings of two inch|es long; which, if furnished each with two or three buds or eyes, will make tollerable sets. When you intend to make a fresh plan|tation, you should, during the winter, when you take up the plants for use, reserve all the best crowns of the main roots for planting. But this latter practice can only be pursued in private gardens: for where the large roots are for sale, their tops must not be taken off, which would render them unsaleable in mar|ket: therefore the Market Gardeners reserve the strongest off-sets arising from the main root.</P>
<P>Being thus furnished with a proper quan|tity of sets, proceed to prepare the ground for their reception. And they may either be p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">nted with a dibble, after the ground is dug; or trenched in, as you proceed in dig|ing the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="020722_0020_0FB0E3CD133910F8">
Choose an open situation, and as light and deep a soil as the Garden affords; which must be trenched regularly one good spade deep at least; but if the ground will admit of it, the deeper it is loosened the better.</P>
<P>Then proceed by dibble planting, in the following manner, being provided with a long dibble, begin at one end of the piece of ground&mdash;range the line cross-ways; and with the dibble make holes about fifteen inches deep; and be careful to make them all of an equal depth; which you may readily do by making a mark upon the dibble. and so thrusting it down to that mark: makeing the holes six inches asunder, dropping as you go on, one set or cutting into each hole, with the crown, &amp;c. upwards; taking care to fill or close the hole properly with earth&mdash;the rows to be one foot six inches asunder.</P>
<P>The other method of planting, by trench|ing in the sets, is, to open a trench at one end, in the common method of trenching, two spades wide and one spade deep or more; and then having the sets or cuttings provided, plant one row along the bottom of the trench with the crowns upright, about six inches asunder; then dig the next trench the same depth and width, turning the earth into the first trench, over the row of sets; thus pro|ceed, trench after trench, to the end.</P>
<P>By practising either of the above methods of planting horse-radish, the sets will put
<PB N="14" REF="020722_0021_0FB0E3CE79AAD910">
forth perfectly straight-rooted shoots quite to the top; whereby they will be long and smooth, and swell evenly their whole length, and will sometimes attain a tolerable perfecti|on the first summer's growth.</P>
<P>When the whole is planted, the ground may be sown with spinage or radishes, which will come off time enough to give the horse radish full time to grow&mdash;for these will not come up till the first or middle of April, when the spinage and radishes will be all gathered.</P>
<P>They must be kept weeded for a month of six weeks, after which the leaves will co|ver the ground, and prevent the growth of weeds.</P>
<P>In the autumn after planting, or about michaelmas, you may begin to take up some of the roots, if wanted for use: but it will be adviseable to let the principal part remain, to have another summer's growth, when they will be very fine and large.</P>
<P>When you take up these roots, it should be done regularly&mdash;not digging up a stick here and there, as is often practised in private gar|dens; but beginning at the first row, and so proceeding from row to row, according as you want them: observing to throw out a trench close along the first row of roots, and as deep as the roots go, but not to loosen the bottom or old set from whence these proceed, which is called the stool.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="020722_0022_0FB0E3D002E257A0">
Having thus cleared away the earth quite close to the stool or bottom of the roots, then with a knife out each root off level, close to the stool from whence it proceeds &dash; for all the stools or bottoms of the roots must be left in the ground undisturbed; for these will yield a supply of fine roots, the succeeding year&mdash;and when the roots are dug up, the old stools still remaining will continue as of|ten as the produce is gathered, to furnish a fresh supply of roots every succeeding year.</P>
<P>But care must be taken, when digging up the roots, always to clear the old stool from all straggling or small roots whatever; and in the summer season to draw up all the small plants rising between the rows.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>PEACH, NECTARINE, &amp; APRICOT, TREES.</HEAD>
<P>PRUNING may be performed on these Trees any time in this month.</P>
<P>In doing this business, you are to observe, that although the trees were pruned last summer, there will still remain many bran|ches which ought to be taken out &mdash; The most irregular and most abundant of them are to be cut away, and a due supply of the best-placed and most moderate, strong
<PB N="16" REF="020722_0023_0FB0E3D41E1E6F18">
shoots are to be preserved, in every part, at proper distances &mdash; For these trees produce their fruit principally from their former sum|mer's shoots.</P>
<P>The old naked branches, having no young shoots on them, should be entirely taken out: which you will frequently meet with in old standard trees; particularly in their lower and middle limbs. The cause is chiefly ow|ing to neglect of pruning, in due season; for the upper branches crowding over the lower and middle ones, destroy their fertility.</P>
<P>Therefore in pruning these trees, let some of the old naked wood be cut away in every winter's pruning, to make room for the last summer's shoots; and where the branches of the trees are too crowded, let them be thin|ed; observing to take off such as grow most i regularly: and when any branches run a|cross, or interfere much with any of the o|thers, in an improper direction, let them be cut out. But a due supply should be left e|very where, at moderate distances, to bear fruit the next summer; and all such as are not wanted must be cut away quite close, leaving only the short spurs.</P>
<P>The weaker shoots, which are now left, must, at the same time, be shortened, more or less, according to the vigour of the tree, and strength of the different shoots; which is done in order to procure an effectual supply
<PB N="17" REF="020722_0024_0FB0E3D78E643440">
of new shoots next year, to bear fruit the year following.</P>
<P>But in shortening the shoots, mind to pro|portion every one, according to it's growth, and original length. For instance&mdash;A shoot of about a foot long, may be shortened to six or seven inches, according to it's strength; and one from fifteen to eighteen inches, may be shortened to about twelve; and one from two to three feet, need not be shortened at all, if the strength is in proportion to it's length. And you will even find sometimes shoots of a foot long that require no shorten|ing, observing always to leave the strongest and largest shoots.</P>
<P>The general rule for shortening the shoots of young trees, after the first year's planting, is, if they are very strong and vigorous, you may shorten them one fourth; if pretty strong, one third; and if weak, cut off two thirds. Observe to prune out side branches, that are above an inch long; and leave none but the main shoots on the trees&mdash;As to the number of the branches, I refer you to head|ing down young trees.&mdash;[See March.]</P>
<P>But such peach, nectarine, and apricot trees, as produce strong and vigorous shoots must be treated accordingly, and must also be shortened less in proportion; and the stronger the branches are, the more room they should have.&mdash;When the tree is pruned,
<PB N="18" REF="020722_0025_0FB0E3D9003C16D0">
the branches should be at least from sixteen to eighteen inches distant from each other, at the extremity of each shoot; but indeed some of the most vigorous shoots should not be shortened at all&mdash;This is the only method of pruning, to bring a vigorous shooting tree in good order, so as to produce moderate shoots, such as will bear fruit.</P>
<P>For the more wood you cut out, and in proportion as the shoots are shortened, the more vigorous the trees will become.</P>
<P>By what I have above hinted, the pruner will not be at a loss to know in what manner peach, nectarine, and apricot trees, accord|ing to their different growth are to be treat|ed. In the article of pruning, the rule here mentioned is always to be applied to win|ter prunings.</P>
<P>Another thing is also proper to be observ|ed; that is, where any young shoots, which are left to bear, have produced only small shoots from their sides, they must be cut off close to the principal, for those will neither produce good fruit, nor good wood.</P>
<P>It is proper to direct also, in shortening the shoots, to cut them off as much as possi|ble at a leaf or wood bud, distinguishable from the blossom buds, by being long and flat; the others being round and swelling: or otherwise to prune to a twain blossom bud, that is where two buds arise at the same eye,
<PB N="19" REF="020722_0026_0FB0E3DA8691D6C8">
having a wood bud between them. Either of these rules are necessary to be observed in shortening; in order that each may produce a leading shoot next summer, forming a lead|er to the main shoots. For where there is a fair leading shoot provided near the extremity of a bearing branch, such shoot seldom fails to yield a fair and well flavoured fruit.</P>
<P>It will be also necessary to remark one thing more in pruning of these trees; parti|cularly the apricot&mdash;In this tree we often perceive in the two year old branches, some short shoots or spurs, on which are frequently to be seen several blossom buds: now some people cut these spurs entirely off, but I am much against such practice; for some of these short natural spurs will produce handsome fruit, both in apricots, peaches, and nectarines, but especially the former.</P>

<P>Prune rasberries&mdash;In doing this let it be observed, that all the old wood that produced fruit last summer must now be cut out; for these never bear but once.&mdash;Therefore a sup|ply of young wood must be left to bear next year; observe therefore to leave several of the strongest of the last summer's shoots standing upon every root, to bear the fruit to be expected next year.&mdash;These being the only proper bearing shoots, they must be allowed room; therefore as above hinted, let all the old wood be cut close to the ground; and se|lecting from three to five of the best young shoots on each root or stool, let all the rest above that number be cut away close to the surface of the earth; and at the same time let all straggling roots be destroyed.</P>

<P>In choosing the plants for this plantation, observe to take such as are well furnished with roots, for that is a principal article in rasber|ry plants; and if there be but one or two or more buds formed on the root for next sum|mer shoots, such plants are particularly to be chosen.</P>

<HEAD>MINT.</HEAD>
<P>This plant is to be propagated, either by parting the root, or by the slips of the young plants, taken up with roots or fibres at the bottom; or by the cuttings of the young stalks next month, or in April, &amp;c. But at this season the increasing it by slips or parting the roots is most generally practised&mdash;and the method is this:</P>
<P>Having procured the roots let them be planted in rows about six inches asunder, and five of six inches distant in the rows; and if the weather is dry let them have a tolerable watering, to settle the earth about their roots.</P>
<P>In the third or fourth week in this month you may have recourse to such old beds of mint, as are well stocked with plants; ob|serving to slip or draw them up by the roots: In doing which, you must draw them up gently, and with the help of your knife at times, to raise or seperate them; by which care, every plant will rise with good roots.</P>
<P>The method of propogating by roots is this: Having procured a sufficient quantity of old roots, draw drills with a hoe six inches asunder, extend the roots or runners along the bottom of the drills; cover them about an inch deep with the earth, and then make the ground even.</P>

<HEAD>PLANTING ASPARAGUS.</HEAD>
<P>Any time in this month is a very proper season to remove the roots of asparagus, for the making of new plantations.</P>
<P>In the doing of which, the chief matter to be regarded is the choice of a proper soil; which should be the best and deepest the gar|den affords: it must not be too wet, nor too strong or stubborn; but such as is moderately light and pliable; so that it will readily fall to pieces in digging, raking, &amp;c. and in a situa|tion that is open, and enjoys the full sun.</P>
<P>The ground where you intend to make new asparagus beds should be regularly trenched or dug to a good depth; and a large quantity of rotten dung buried in each trench, at least ten or twelve inches below the surface of the ground.</P>
<P>The ground being dug and laid level, di|vide it into beds three feet in width, with al|leys about twenty inches wide between&punc; bed and bed.</P>
<P>Two rows of these roots are to be planted on each bed, allowing about sixteen or eigh|teen inches between each plant; and let the rows be about eighteen inches from row to row.</P>
<P>Next let it be observed that the plants to be chosen must not be more than two years old; but most good gardeners prefer those that are only one year from the seed, which are such
<PB N="35" REF="020722_0042_0FB0E2FEC4DF9AB8">
as I would recommend&punc; as from experience I have found they have generally taken root more freely, and succeeded every way better than two year old plants.</P>
<P>The following is the method of planting them:</P>
<P>Strain your line length-ways the beds, about eight inches from the edge; and then, with a spade, cut out a small trench or drill, close to the line, about six inches deep; making that side next the line nearly upright; and when one trench is opened, plant that, before you open another, at the distance be|fore directed.</P>
<P>In placing the roots observe they must not be horizontally extended or put flat in the bottom of the trench, as practised by some people; but they must be laid nearly up|right, against the back of the trench or drill, so that the crown of the plants may also stand upright, about two to three inches below the surface of the ground: Let them be all placed at an equal depth, spreading their roots a little in nearly a direct position against the back of the trench; and, at the same time, drawing a little earth up against them with the hand, as you place them; just to fix the plants in their due position. When one drill is thus planted, immediately with the rake draw the earth into the drill over the plants; and then open another drill, pro|ceed
<PB N="36" REF="020722_0043_0FB0E30050D2E668">
in the same method till the whole is plant|ed. Then let the surface of the bed be raked smooth, and cleared from stones, &amp;c.</P>
<P>At each corner of every bed, let a firm stake be driven into the ground, to serve as a mark for the alleys.</P>
<P>It is the custom with some people, who are obliged to make the most of every spot of ground, to sow a thin crop of onions, the first year, on new asparagus beds; and this should be performed before the beds are ra|ked; sowing the seeds and raking them light|ly in. A crop of onions may thus be ob|tained, without hurting the asparagus, pro|vided the onions are not suffered to grow just about the plants.</P>
<P>The asparagus being planted, the next care is, when the plants come up, which will be about the end of this month, or the begin|ning of the next, to keep them clean from weeds; which must be particularly attended to during the summer season.&mdash;[For the further management in dressing up the beds, &amp;c. which must be done this month, see October.]</P>
<P>It will be two years, from the time of planting two year old roots, before the aspa|ragus will produce handsome buds large enough for use; tho' sometimes a few of the largest are cut the second spring after plant|ing. But I do advise to let it be the third
<PB N="37" REF="020722_0044_0FB0E30641B9BDF0">
year before you make a general cutting.</P>
<P>A plantation of asparagus, if the beds are properly dressed every year, as directed, in the spring and autumn months, will continue to produce buds for twelve or fourteen years.</P>
<P>In making new plantations of asparagus, it is the custom with some gardeners, instead of putting in your plants as before directed, to sow the seed at once in the beds, where the plants are to remain: This is not a bad me|thod&mdash;for by such practice the roots are not disturbed by a removal, and consequently cannot fail of producing a regular crop. But it must be observed, that if two pieces of ground are to be laid down the same year with asparagus; supposing one piece to be planted with young roots, and the other sown with seed, that piece which was planted will be ready to cut, a year before that sown with seed.</P>
<P>However to such as choose to raise a plan|tation of asparagus at once from seed, the method is this:</P>
<P>The beds are to be three feet wide, and prepared as before directed for the plants; then mark out two lines lengthways on the beds, and allowing these lines at the distance of sixteen or eighteen inches, dot in a few seeds, covering them about half an inch deep. When the plants have been up some time, you must thin them, leaving only one of the
<PB N="38" REF="020722_0045_0FB0E307BB886AE0">
strongest in each place, and carefully clearing them from weeds&mdash;</P>
<P>A plantation of asparagus thus raised will produce beds fit to cut the fourth spring after sowing, but they will be very large and fine the fifth year.</P>
<P>This is now the season to sow asparagus seed, to raise plants to make new plantations.</P>
<P>This seed should be sown about the begin|ning or middle of this month, on beds of rich earth, about four feet wide, Let it be sown in the broad cast, on the surface; and throw up the alleys about fourteen or sixteen inches wide, and three inches deep; let the seed be buried about half an inch in the earth, and let the ground be raked smooth:&mdash;the plants will be up in a month, when they must be kept very clean from weeds, by a careful hand, weeding them at different times in the sum|mer.</P>
<P>If the weather be very dry, when the plants come up, it will be proper to refresh them, now and then, with a little water; which will greatly forward them in their growth.</P>
<P>They will be fit to plant out for good next spring, agreeable to the method prescribed.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICHOKES.</HEAD>
<P>Make a general dressing of artichokes, the beginning or middle of this month.</P>
<P>Where the plants have been landed up in
<PB N="39" REF="020722_0046_0FB0E309901B1BA0">
the autumn to protect them from frost, let the ground be now levelled down, especially if the plants have begun to shoot tolerably strong; observe, as you proceed in levelling down, to dig and loosen all the earth about the plants; and at the same time, examine the number of shoots or suckers proceeding from each stool or root; and selecting two or three of the strongest to remain on every stool or root, you may then readily get to slip the superabundant shoots off clean from the place whence they arise; minding, as above direct|ed, to leave two good shoots, but never more than three, upon each root or stock; closing again and gently pressing the earth about the roots, and also about the young plants, with your hands.</P>
<P>The shoots that are slipped off will serve to make fresh plantations, where wanted; for artichokes are generally increased by planting the young shoots; and this is the season to do it.</P>
<P>When any new plantations of artichokes are intended, let them be planted so soon in this month as you can procure good plants for that purpose; observing that those slips or suckers slipped off, in spring dressing, from the largest plants, as above directed, are the proper sets to be chosen.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of artichokes, the large globe, and the French green or oval arti|choke;
<PB N="40" REF="020722_0047_0FB0E30DE4E80750">
but the former is greatly preferable to plant for a general supply, the head being con|siderably larger, and the eatable parts more thick and fleshy.</P>
<P>They should be planted in an open situa|tion, and in good ground; it may be neces|sary therefore to spread a quantity of good rot|ten dung over the piece, and to dig it in.&mdash;The sets must be planted, with a dib|ble, in rows of five feet asunder, and four feet in the row&mdash;give them some water immedi|ately after they are planted, to settle the earth about the plants.</P>
<P>The above plantation, if kept clear from weeds, and watered now and then in dry wea|ther, in the beginning of the spring, till they have taken good root, will not fail to yield artichokes in June.</P>
<P>You may in the spring, when your arti|chokes are dressed, plant a row of drum head cabbage plants between them, or sow radish|es, spinage and lettuce; as also, between the rows of your new planted shoots.</P>
<P>A plantation of artichokes will continue to produce good heads six or seven years, and sometimes longer; but it must be observed, that such person as desire to have a succession of them for two or three months in the sum|mer, should make a new plantation every spring; for the old stocks, which have been planted a year or two, produce heads in May
<PB N="41" REF="020722_0048_0FB0E311B04D8638">
and June; and the slips planted now pro|duce their heads in June and July.</P>
<P>About the latter end of this month, sow the seed of artichokes; for this purpose choose a small piece of good ground, in an open situation; throw it up into a bed, about four feet wide; draw four drills thereon, about nine inches from each other, and half an inch deep; plant the seeds about six inches distant in the row; cover the seed over and rake the other ground smooth.

<HEAD>IRISH POTATOES.</HEAD>
<P>Irish potatoes may be planted at any time in this month&mdash;these roots thrive best in a moderate, light, loose soil; and where it is not wet, if you add dung it will be of great advantage.</P>
<P>For propagating potatoes be careful to procure some good roots; that is, to pick a quantity of the best kind of potatoes, choos|ing such as are perfectly sound, and of a to|lerable large size: These are to be prepared for planting, by cutting or quartering them; that is to say, each root is to be cut into two&punc; three, or more pieces, minding particularly that each piece be furnished with at least one or two good buds, which will be sufficient. Being thus prepared, they are to be planted in rows two feet and a half from each other&punc; and about a foot in the row, and two inches deep.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="020722_0049_0FB0E3132F5CF448">
As to the method of planting, it is fre|quently performed with a blunt ended dib|ble; but some plant them as they proceed in digging or plowing the ground, placing them in the trenches or furrows as they go on, and turning the earth from the next trench or furrow over them; and so on to the end.</P>
<P>Others dig or plough the ground; then draw drills with a hoe, about two or three inches deep; and so drop the set into the drills and cover them in.</P>
<P>But where people plant large quantities, the most expeditious way is to plow them in, by placing the potatoes in the furrows; miss two furrows, and plant one; but you must observe, that your ground must be in good order, clean, and free from weeds, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>TURNIPS.</HEAD>

But I observe that few people sow turnips at this season; and the reason is, I have heard many say, that they will all go to seed. But the chief cause why they so frequently run to seed is, that it is greatly degenerated, by being sown too often in the same soil; but you will find that when your seed is fresh imported from Europe, not one in ten thousand will run.</P>
<P>Let this seed be sown in an open spot of

<HEAD>PLUMB AND CHERRY TREES.</HEAD>
<P>PRUNE, plumb and cherry trees, at any time in this month, if not done before.</P>
<P>In pruning plumb and cherry trees, either espaliers or standards; observe, that the same bearers remain many years in a fruitful state.&mdash;Let only any causual worn out wood, or any irregular crowded branches, and de|cayed parts be cut out, together with all the superfluous and ill placed young shoots of last summer.&mdash;</P>
<P>But it must be observed, where a supply of young bearing wood is wanting in any part of these trees, that some of the best situated shoots of the last summer's growth must be left in every such place; these shoots are not to be shortened, but each must be left at full length, without being reduced at any future pruning, in summer or winter, where there is room for them.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="020722_0051_0FB0E31641D0E7A0">
For the shoots, which are now left at full length, and not hereafter shortened, will, in the second or third year after, begin to pro|duce some thick short shoots or spurs, about an inch or more in length; and upon these spurs, and on no other, the fruit of these trees is produced.</P>
<P>But on the contrary, if the shoots which are left in to bear were to be shortened, as by many is ignorantly practised, they would not, in that case, produce any such fruit-bearing spurs; but, in the places where the spurs or blossom-buds will otherwise appear, would send out numbers of strong and altogether use|less shoots; with which the trees would be continually crowded; and not one branch would be in a condition to bear, so long as you keep shortening them: and the trees thus mismanaged would not produce one tenth part of the fruit as when treated in the method above mentioned.&mdash;</P>
<P>Therefore be careful to leave the young shoots as they advance in full length, without reducing them, unless you should perceive any irregular or superabundant ones which may require to be taken out, in which case they should be pruned away close to the mo|ther branches.</P>
<P>This plainly shows, what method is to be taken, in pruning these trees, to bring them into a condition to bear; it also plainly shows,
<PB N="45" REF="020722_0052_0FB0E3189794E168">
that neither the young shoots nor old branch|es are, in the general course of pruning, to be shortened.</P>
<P>But in the course of pruning the above trees, the branches in general should be well examined with a curious eye; and if there are any which are old or worn out, and not fur|nished with good bearing spurs, let such as are decayed, or in an unfruitful state, be taken out, to make room for the more proper bear|ing wood and for a supply of young shoots, in a regular manner.</P>
<P>When the old useless wood is cut out, ex|amine the remaining branches, &amp;c. And where these stand too close let some of them be cut away, observing to prune out the most unpromising and irregularly grown, and such as can be best spared; and let no two branch|es cross each other&mdash;and all the summer shoots which are not wanted for a supply of wood, must be now cut away quite close, leaving no spurs but such as are naturally produced.</P>

<P>Strawberries may be planted till the middle of this month; but the best season is about the latter end of September, or the beginning of October; for, in such case, they will bear fruit the summer after: indeed those planted now will take root freely; but will not bear any fruit until the next year.&mdash;Observing that the proper sets for planting are the young off|sets or runners of last summer; such as I ad|vised to be left in May, which must be now procured from these beds of old plants that are in full perfection for bearing, taking them up with good roots, and not disturbing the old stools. Prepare for these plants a piece of good land, if loomy the better, and let some good rotten dung if you can procure it, be dug in.

<HEAD>PLANTING FRUIT TREES.</HEAD>
<P>Fruit trees, of all sorts, may be planted any time in this month.</P>
<P>Let every kind be planted at proper dis|tances, so that they may have room to grow, without interfering with each other; which, in a few years, is often the case in many gar|dens and orchards.</P>
<P>Peaches and nectarines should never be planted less than twenty-five feet distant from each other; and if you plant them thirty, it would be a more eligible plan; tho' the dis|tance appears considerable at first, yet, if trees are grafted or budded upon free growing stocks, they will readily fill up that place; and bear much better than if confined, so as to require to be often cut back, and kept within bounds.</P>
<P>Standard apple and pear trees, when plant|ed in an orchard, should be at least thirty feet distant from each other; and if the land is rich and strong, if they had forty it would be the better.</P>
<P>The rule, I advise, to plant standard fruit trees in general is, to allow apple and fruit trees in an orchard, from thirty to forty feet distance, every way; peaches, nectarines and apricots, from twenty-five to thirty feet dis|tance; cherries and plumbs, from eighteen to twenty-five; almonds, quinces and med|lars, from sixteen to twenty. Observing,
<PB N="49" REF="020722_0056_0FB0E323A9E7AD28">
these are the least distances that should be al|lowed; but where there is a good scope of ground, you may allow them five, ten, or even twenty feet more room: for in the end, it will prove to be of greater advan|tage, when the trees arrive at their full growth.</P>
<P>In planting trees of any kind, let care be taken that they are not planted too deep; for that is a more material point than many peo|ple imagine.</P>
<P>Open for each tree a hole, wide enough to receive the roots freely, without pressing them against the sides; then, having the trees ready dug up with good spreading roots, which you must take care not to injure in the operation, let the ends of the straggling ones be pruned; and cut off all such as are broken or bruised: then set the tree in the hole, and see that all the roots spread freely as they should do, so as the upper roots be rather over than below the general surface of the ground.&mdash;Break the earth well, and throw it in equally about the roots; and in so doing shake the tree gently, that the earth may fall in close between the roots and fibres.</P>
<P>When the earth is all in, tread the surface gently, to fix the tree properly; and lastly raise a small concave hill round the tree.</P>
<P>Support new planted trees with stakes, as soon as they are planted; that they may not

<P>Where the branches stand too close, so as not to admit a free circulation of air through the tree, let some of these be also cut away.&mdash;The keeping the trees thin, and taking away all irregular and old worn out branches, is the only way to have large and well tasted fruit, and also handsome and lasting trees.</P>

the hoe, it will in a great manner promote their growth.</P>
<P>However, at any rate, let the plants be thined out properly, so that they may have full liberty to grow at the top, and to swell at the bottom. Thin out therefore the ge|neral crops to about seven or eight inches at least, and cut up all the weeds, for there is nothing like allowing these plants plenty of room; by which means, if the ground be good, the roots will become long and strait.</P>
<P>The parsnips in particular should be thined out to twelve inches distance; then the roots will swell to a considerable size, and attain their utmost perfection.</P>
<P>Such crops of carrots however, as are in|tended to be drawn for the table when young, need not to be thined at first, to more than four or five inches apart; for, by a gradual thining out the larger, for use, the rest will increase in their growth daily.</P>
<P>But the main crops of carrots, that you intend to grow to a full size, should be thin|ed properly at once; you should in this case allow them full eight or nine inches at least; but if they were placed from ten to twelve inches asunder, it would be the better.</P>

Various are the opinions about sowing these roots for winter use; therefore I think it in|cumbent on me to let no observation escape that may add to the culture of these valuable vegetables.</P>
<P>In England the culture of carrots has ar|rived to such perfection, that for my own cre|dit I refrain from relating real facts; for I am sure, not one in a thousand would believe me.</P>
<P>It seems to be the general opinion of most people, that if they sow their winter crops of carrots before June, they will run all to seed; but those ideas are entirely erroneous; for success depends chiefly on the kind of seed.&mdash;If it be the true orange carrot, it will not run;&mdash;but if the seed sown in March or April, be of the pale degenerated sort, they will run to seed by September; or, as the gardeners express it, they will all be speared to a plant; while the produce of the true ge|nuine seed imported from Europe, will be in its full vigor. Besides, it is a very hard mat|ter to get the carrot seed to grow in June, that month often proving dry, and the weather very hot; therefore people who have occasion to sow large crops of carrots for the winter use, should take every precaution to keep the ground as dry as possible&punc;</P>

confine the alleys, but let them be full fifteen inches wide, and not less than six inches deep; by which means you will be able to draw off the water; for if it is suffered to lay on the beds or even in the alleys, the intense heat of the sun in July and August, will scall the roots and rot them.</P>
<P>Having laid out the ground into beds, let the surface be raked smooth; then draw four drills on each bed at equal distances, about half an inch deep; and scatter the seeds thin in each drill; cover the seed with your hoe; and rake the ground even standing in the alleys.</P>

<P>There is no work in the kitchen garden that requires more attention than this: for weeds are at no time more dangerous to crops than at the present: it should be therefore the principal care of the gardener to de|stroy them before they grow large; for weeds, when permitted to get to much size, not only exhaust the goodness of the land, and ruin the present crops, but are also a very dis|agreeable sight, and require more than double labour to clear the ground of them.</P>

Let the utmost attention be paid to your small crops that grow pretty close; and let them be timely cleared.</P>
<P>That is, let the weeds be cleared away and not suffered to over-spread the plants, which they would soon do when they begin to run, and in this case would do much da|mage to the crops.</P>
<P>Besides, when the weeds are suffered to grow large among the small crops, so as to mix and entangle one with another, and with the plants, it renders the work of hoe|ing or weeding them extremely tedious, and very troublesome to perform.</P>
<P>But when weeds appear between the rows of beans, pease, cabbages, and such crops as stand in wide rows, nothing can be more easy than to stop their progress; because, there is room between the plants to admit a large hoe&mdash;and with such an instrument a person may go over a large piece of ground in a lit|tle time; therefore he who would suffer weeds to grow among such crops will be much to blame.</P>

<P>THESE trees, in favourable seasons, will set ten times as much fruit as their roots are capable of supplying with proper nou|rishment; and if the whole, or even too ma|ny of them were to be left, they would starve one another; and the fruit in general would be small and ill flavoured.</P>
<P>Besides, where this precaution is not ob|served and too great a quantity of these sorts of fruit remain to ripen on the trees, the ill consequence does not terminate altogether in the badness of the fruit that year, but it
<PB N="92" REF="020722_0099_0FB0E385A025F330">
extends to two or three years to come.&mdash;For by suffering the trees to be over burden|ed with fruit, the branches are robbed of their due nourishment; and the trees are so much exhausted that they will not be able to produce shoots capable of bearing fruit the next, and perhaps subsequent year;&mdash;and it may probably be the third year before a crop of good fruit can be reasonable expected.</P>
<P>Therefore when the fruit is produced too thick upon the trees, and advanced to about the size of a nutmeg, or before; let the quantity be reduced;&mdash;and the sooner the work is done the better it is for the trees, and also for the fruit that is to remain on them.</P>
<P>This thinning should be performed in a very careful manner, by looking over the branches regularly one by one; and before you take any off, single out, on each shoot, the fruit that is proper to leave, and let the most promising and best shapen remain:&mdash;paying a due regard to those that are best situ|ated on the branches:&mdash;each kind according to its size must be left at such proper dis|tances, that every one may have sufficient room to swell and grow freely to its just big|ness every way; and the fruit on the strong shoots should be left at least nine or ten inch|es from each other.&mdash;For instance allow|ing a tree is in good condition and strength
<PB N="93" REF="020722_0100_0FB0E38759609118">
for bearing;&mdash;and supposing the shoots to be of three different sizes; that is, the strong, the middling, and the weak: the number of fruit to be on those branches are; upon the stronger, three or four of the fairest and best placed; upon the middling shoots two or three, and not more than one on the weak shoots.</P>
<P>Was a due regard to be paid to the above distances, and to the number of fruit menti|oned to be left on the different branches; the thinning them nicely in this manner, will be the means of bringing your fruit to the utmost perfection.&mdash;At the same time the trees will shoot freely, and produce a suffici|ent quantity of good wood to bear fruit the next year.</P>
<P>This should be the method of thinning the choice kinds of fruits; but the small and inferior sorts, may be left closer together, and a greater number of fruit may remain upon the different branches:&mdash;For instance, the early masculine apricot, the nutmeg peach, and the fair Child's early nectarine are of the earliest kinds, and by far the smal|lest; of these there may be left upon each of the strong shoots, about five fruit; and on the middle size three or four, and so in pro|portion on the weaker shoots.</P>

<P>Likewise let all the luxuriant shoots that generally rise out of the old wood be taken away;&mdash;these will neither produce good fruit nor kindly wood, and will also greatly injure the growth of the prime shoots; they are always known by their rambling and vigo|rous growth: and as I before observed, in treating of pruning in a former month, branches shooting out from the middle part of the tree should be all displaced, unless any should seem necessary in particular parts, to fill up a vacancy, or to furnish a supply of wood&mdash;but only some occasional shoots of these kinds should be left, and let all the others be cleared away quite close.</P>

both in giving an opportunity of per|forming the work with more expedition and regularity, and in affording a greater benefit to the trees and fruit.&mdash;Observe that all the immediate bearing shoots, which now discover the young bunches of grapes upon them, must be left,&mdash;and such other shoots as have strength, and are well situated for the purpose of throwing out bearers next year, must be left in the places where they are wanted; but all weak and straggling shoots, such particularly as often arise im|mediately from the old wood are useless, and must be cleared away, where-ever they are produced; except in such places where young wood is absolutely needful;&mdash;and even strong shoots that are destitute of fruit, and arise in places where they are not evidently wanted, should also be taken off.</P>
<P>When this is done, let all the bearing shoots, and all others that are necessary, be left in their proper places, in regular order&mdash;and do not stop any of the shoots now, but let each be left at full length for the present, so that all the branches, and fruit, may equally enjoy the advantages of sun and air.</P>

<P>Your cabbage plants, that were sown a|bout the middle of April, will be fit to plant out early in this month, to the places where they are to cabbage.</P>
<P>For these plants prepare a piece of good ground, in the most open situation of your garden:&mdash;Dung it well with good rotten dung, if you can procure it; and dig it in evenly, laying the surface smooth; then mark out the ground for the plants, in rows about two feet or two feet and a half; and if your plants be of a very large kind, you may even allow them three feet from row to row, and two feet and a half from each other in the rows:&mdash;Observe that the distance for planting cabbage plants depends entirely on the goodness of the land.&mdash;The surface of

the ground being laid even, and your rows all marked out, draw the earth up into small ridges or beds about six or seven inches high; and let the top of them be flat, observing at the same time to let these small beds or ridges range with the descent of the ground, if there be any; for if the water is suffered to lie in the alleys next month, when the heavy rains set in, the roots of the plants will be scalded; this is a very material cir|cumstance which you ought to guard against.</P>
<P>It is very necessary also to observe, that the plants, at this season, should be planted out as soon after a shower of rain as possible; and if the weather should prove dry, give them now and then a little water every even|ing, till they have taken good root;&mdash;and should the day after planting prove very hot, which often happens in this month, it would be of great advantage to the plants to stick a small bush on the south side of them; which would not only protect the plants from the violence of the sun, but greatly promote their taking root.</P>
<P>You may still continue to sow cabbages and savoys, for winter use.</P>
<P>The seed, at this season, should be sown on beds about four feet wide; and if the weather proves dry, water them well every evening, both before and after the plants are come up; and if the beds had a temporary

<P>It is always the best method to leave the trees pretty full of proper shoots, at this season; they will be ready, in case they should be wanted, to fill up any vacancy, or to sup|ply the place of old useless dead or worn out wood, when you come to prune in the win|ter; and such shoots as are not wanted may then be cut away.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>PRUNE PEACH, NECTARINE, AND APRICOT TREES.</HEAD>
<P>IN gardens where these trees have not yet had their summer pruning, that very needful work should be done early in this month,
<PB N="122" REF="020722_0129_0FB0EE5A79EADBC8">
otherwise the fruit upon such trees will not only be small and ill formed, but also very bad tasted, in comparison to the true flavour of this fruit.</P>
<P>And besides retarding the growth, and de|basing the taste of the fruit, it is also detri|mental in a very great degree, to both stand|ard and espalier trees, to neglect summer pruning until this time; and in particular peach, nectarine, and apricots, and such like trees as produce their fruit principally upon one year old shoots.</P>
<P>Besides, it causes great perplexity to the operator, to break through and regulate such a confusion of young shoots;&mdash;it also re|quires treble pains and labour, and cannot be executed with half the accuracy as when the work is commenced early in the summer.</P>
<P>There is a very great advantage in begin|ning early in the summer to prune, train and leave the useful shoots in their proper places; and at the same time to clear the trees from all that are ill-placed and luxuriant:&mdash;For when the useless ones are timely cut away, and the useful left in a regular manner all the summer, the sun, air and gentle showers will have a proper access, not only to pro|mote the growth and improve the flavour of the fruit, but also to harden and ripen the shoots perfectly, which is absolutely necessa|ry to their producing good fruit the next year.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="020722_0130_0FB0EE5C9A191F30">
But however, where there are standard and espalier trees still remain unpruned, do not fail to let it be done the beginning of this month.</P>
<P>Do not shorten any of the shoots at this time; but let every one be left at full length.</P>
<P>Look also again over such espalier trees as were pruned, and tied down the two&punc; last months; and see if all the proper shoots which were laid in before, keep firm to their places;&mdash;and where any of them have been displaced, or got loose, let them be ti|ed, and nailed again close in proper order.</P>
<P>Likewise observe, if there has been any straggling shoots produced since last month, in places where not wanted, let them be al|so displaced.</P>
<P>It would also be very necessary to look over again, those trees that were pruned in April and May;&mdash;you will find on them a great number of useless shoots that are put out since that time, which should be cut away; in particular side shoots that have put out this summer's branches&mdash;let these be cut away also.</P>

There are a number of indiscreet people that would sow seeds at this season when the ground is dry, without any shade; when three successive hot days would totally destroy the germina|tion of all the seeds that are even buried at a proper depth.&mdash;How cautious then people ought to be of sowing any kind of seeds in hot weather without shading or watering them.</P>
<P>If you have any good cabbage plants of the large kind, that are now sit to put out, let a piece of ground be prepared to receive them.&mdash;After the ground is manured, well dug, and the surface laid even, mark it out in rows about two feet; or, if you have a plen|ty of garden room, two feet and a half from each other;&mdash;then with a hoe draw the earth up into small beds or ridges, about six inches high, and near a foot broad on the top; and set the plants about two seet from each other in the rows:&mdash;if the weather be dry, give them some water, and let it be repeated eve|ry evening till they have taken good root.</P>

It would be very imprudent to destroy the old beds the same year you make your new ones; as they will bear but little for the first and second season: tho' the third year they will come into full bearing, and pro|duce fruit plentifully:&mdash;Therefore, as I ob|served above, take out only such young plants as can be best spared, and will not injure your crop, for the ensuing year.&mdash;You will find many young plants round the outside of the old beds, which (if not taken up to make new plantations) must be destroyed&mdash;let it be observed that the old plants which bore fruit the last year, are not proper to be planted out; for they will not produce fruit more than one season, when they die, and are succeeded by young shoots every sum|mer:&mdash;It is these and these only, that I mean should be planted out to form new beds.</P>

<HEAD>PLANTING EARLY BEANS.</HEAD>
<P>NEAR the middle, or the latter end of this month, you may plant some beans to come early the succeeding spring.</P>
<P>Those which are planted now, if they survive the winter's frost, &amp;c. will be fit for use early in April.</P>
<P>The Mazagon bean is the best to plant at this season; for they will come up earlier then any other sort, and are excellent bear|ers tho' but of an humble growth; and they will stand the winter better then the larger kinds.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="020722_0165_0FB0EE9D46BFF378">
A warm border under a south wall, is the best situation to plant those beans at this season.</P>
<P>They should be planted in rows across the border&mdash;that is, provided the border is five or six feet wide; observing that the rows are to be two feet asunder, which will be room enough for this sort.&mdash;The beans should be planted four or five inches from each other in the rows, and near an inch and a half deep.</P>
<P>You may also plant one row lengthways of the border, within two or three inches of the wall or fence: these will sometimes out|live the winter, when those at a greater dis|tance from the wall, &amp;c. are destroyed.</P>
<P>But, if the border is narrow, you had better plant two rows only lengthways; that is, one row near the wall, and the other about two feet and a half from it.</P>
<P>They may be planted wither with a blunt dibble putting them in about an inch and a half, or near two inches deep; or you may draw drills that depth, and drop the beans therein; drawing the earth an equal depth over them, and rake the ground smooth.</P>
<P>In planting early beans, it often proves successful first to sow them pretty thick in a bed of rich earth; and when they come up a little height, transplant them into the bor|ders.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="020722_0166_0FB0EE9ED89503B8">
The method is this:&mdash;Dig a bed about three or four feet broad, of good earth, in a warm corner of your garden.</P>
<P>The ground being dug, draw the earth off about an inch and an half or near two inches in depth equally from the surface, half to the one side and half to the other.&mdash;This done, scatter the beans thereon about an inch asunder, and immediately cover them over with the earth that was drawn off for that purpose: or you may with your hoe draw broad flat drills cross-way the bed, and scat|ter the beans pretty thick, and cover them over with earth equally; and if severe frost should prevail in their infant slate while re|maining altogether in this, they can readily be protected with a few pine tops till they are fit to transplant.</P>
<P>When the beans are come up an inch and a half or two inches high, they should then in mild weather, be transplanted into the above mentioned borders, taking them care|fully out of the seed-bed with their full spreading roots, and as much earth as will hang about them&mdash;pull the old beans at the bottom, and trim the end of the perpendicu|lar root, and then plant them in rows in the same manner and at the same distance as be|fore directed; observing to close the earth well about every plant&mdash;they will soon take root and grow freely.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="020722_0167_0FB0EEA070EF67A0">
One reason for this practice is, the best of gardeners allow, that the beans which are transplanted, will come in sooner by a week or ten days than those that are not, though the seed be put in the ground the same day.</P>

<P>A warm south border, under a wall or fence, is the most proper place to sow them in at this season&mdash;the seed must be sown in drills, either lengthways or in rows, athwart the border, according to its breadth: where it is but narrow, draw one drill only length|ways at the distance of one or two feet from the wall or fence, and scatter the pease there|in pretty thick, but as regular as possible&mdash;cover them up immediately with cath about an inch and a half deep, and rake the ground even.</P>
<P>Where your border is five or six feet wide, it would be proper to sew the peae in drills cross-ways
<PB N="161" REF="020722_0168_0FB0EEA21ED1CD10">

<HEAD>BEANS.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the middle of this month prepare some good ground in a sheltered situati|on, for a successional crop of beans.</P>
<P>If you have not planted any before this period, let some of the mazagons be put in as early in this month as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="020722_0174_0FB0ED89F9C9D2C0">
You may also plant some of the long pod|ded, and Windsor, at the same time; as they will succeed each other in bearing.</P>
<P>Ler the mazagons be planted in rows, two, or two and a half feet&mdash;the long pod|ded two and a half, to three feet&mdash;and the Windsor three, or three and a half feet from row to row, and a proper distance in the rows, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;The first sort three inches&mdash;the second five inches&mdash;and the latter eight inches from each other.</P>
<P>If you have any beans that are up about two or three inches above the ground, let some earth be drawn up to their stems.&mdash;This work should be done in a mild, fine day, when the surface is perfectly dry: By this method you will not only preserve your plants in a great measure from the frost, but will support and strengthen them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>PEASE.</HEAD>
<P>Sow more pease about the middle of this month, to succeed those which were sown in November; and in order to have a regular supply for the table.</P>
<P>If you neglected to sow any in the last month, do not delay it now; for the sooner you perform this business the better.&mdash;I would recommend the early kinds at this season, which will come forward with some prospect of success, and nearly as soon as
<PB N="168" REF="020722_0175_0FB0ED8B7557B748">
those sown in the former month; as they are not so likely to be injured by the frost, and will probably bear a much greater crop.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of this month, you may sow in a sheltered situation, some mar|rowfats and sugar pease.&mdash;These sorts will require sticking when they are three or four inches above the ground; and as they run very stately, your sticks ought to be at least five or six feet high; and your plants five or six feet from row to row; and not so thick in the rows as the early kinds.</P>
<P>This distance will appear very great at first; but be assured that your crop will be much the better for it, as it will admit of a free circulation of air between the rows.&mdash;You may if you think proper, plant cabbage plants between each row of pease.</P>
<P>Let the pease which was sown last month, have some earth drawn up to their stems, as it will strengthen them greatly, and prevent the wet weather from rotting them near the ground.&mdash;If you was to stick a row of pine or any other ever-green bushes betwixt the rows, it would be of infinite service in breaking the cold wind, which very often cuts off the early crops of pease.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>CABBAGES.</HEAD>
<P>Near the latter end of this month, the cabbage plants that were sown in October, will be by this time fit to plant out.</P>

Choose a piece of good ground in a shel|tered part of the garden; and lay on it some good rotten dung, and dig it in a full spade deep&mdash;lay the surface even, and rake the stones away if any; and put out the early York, cabbage plants in rows, about two feet from each other from row to row, and twenty inches in the rows; and let the sugar leaves be planted tow feet every way; and allow the large kinds two feet and half by two feet.&mdash;If this crop is properly managed, they will make fine heads in April and May.</P>
<P>If you have a plenty of cabbage plants which were raised from English seed sown in September or October, it would be very ad|viseable to plant some between the rows of early beans and peas, to out up for use in March, when you will find greens scarce&mdash;let it be observed that the ground ought to be always fresh digged before you put out these plants this matter is of more conse|quence than many people are aware of.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>CAULIFLOWERS.</HEAD>
<P>Towards the latter end of this month, if your cauliflower plants (which were sown in October) are grown to a good size, let some of them be put out on the south border of your garden, if it is vacant&mdash;if not, the most warm and sheltered place that you can con|veniently spare&mdash;let it be well manured,
<PB N="170" REF="020722_0177_0FB0ED9075C64FC8">
and dug a full spade deep&mdash;rake the ground even, and put out the plants in rows full two feet from each other.</P>
<P>The cauliflower plants which were put out in May and June last, will now begin to show their heads&mdash;you should therefore be very careful in protecting them from the frost.&mdash;For this purpose provide yourself with a number of hay, straw, or moss bands, well twisted together, binding the same round the stalks of your plants, beginning at the bottom close to the ground till you come up to about one third part of the leaves&mdash;let care be taken that you do not wind it too light round the leaves; but let the band be rather flack so as to afford the head sufficient room to swell;&mdash;you may tie the leaves together near their tops; for by this treatment you will not only preserve the cauliflowers from the frost, but will be the means also of ren|dering them perfectly white and beautiful to the eye.</P>
<P>Let the bands that are tied round the leaves be frequently examined; and see if the head has sufficient room to swell: if you find the band too tight, let it be loosened that the head may grow free and easy.</P>

<P>Let the ground between the last planted crop of brocoli be now hoed for the last time,
<PB N="171" REF="020722_0178_0FB0ED9187DFCAF8">

<HEAD>RADISHES.</HEAD>
<P>Towards the latter end of this month, sow some short-top radishes for an early crop.</P>
<P>Let a good piece of ground be prepared as open to the sun as possible; and if your south border is not engaged, it would be the most proper place to sow your seed in at this season.</P>
<P>The border being properly manured and dug, sow the seed broad cast pretty thick: you may also sow a sprinkling of carrots with your radishes; for if one should fail the other may come on&mdash;the latter will arrive to perfection and fit to be drawn before the carrots are got to any size: therefore, should they both succeed, the growth of the one will be no impediment to the other.&mdash;If it is not convenient for you to sow carrots, spi|nage may be sown with an equal prospect of advantage.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>LETTUCES.</HEAD>
<P>Let a small piece of good ground be pre|pared towards the latter end of this month, as open to the sun and as sheltered from the cold winds as possible) in order to sow some lettuce seed.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="020722_0179_0FB0ED93206EB430">
The best sorts for this sowing, are the brown Silesia cabbage, and brown Dutch, they being the most hardy kinds.</P>
<P>Let the seed be sown pretty thick and even&mdash;cast a little earth over it and rake the surface smooth.</P>
<P>Should the weather prove frosty after the plants are up, it would be very necessary to cover them over while in an infant state, every night with pine, or other ever-green bushes, which will in a great measure pro|tect them from the frost, as well as forward|ing their growth.</P>
<P>The lettuces which are out in beds or borders, should be now kept perfectly clean of weeds, and the ground often loosened be|tween them, which will encourage their progress.</P>

<HEAD>SMALL SALADING.</HEAD>
<P>Where small salading is required, you should sow some at least every ten or twelve days, in a situation that is open to the sun; and in drills as directed in the former months&mdash;should there be any appearance of a frost, it would not be amiss to lay straw or bushes lightly over the plants every night, as it will greatly preserve and cherish them.</P>

<P>The earliest planted onions should be now kept free from weeds, and the ground hoed frequently between them, which will great|ly forward your plants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>CARROTS.</HEAD>
<P>If the weather is mild and dry towards the latter end of this month, let a piece of ground be put in proper order to receive some car|rot seed&mdash;the best sort for this sowing is the early horn or short orange; as they will come in for use near a month sooner than the long orange.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="020722_0181_0FB0ED9655299270">
It would be very necessary to give your ground a moderate dressing with good rotten dung turned in well, which divide into beds four feet wide, sowing four rows of carrot seed on each bed, but not too thick&mdash;you may if you choose, sow a sprinkling of short top radishes with your carrots.</P>
<P>Let it be observed, that it must be the true orange carrot seed that is to be sown at this season: for if you sow the pale degenerated kind, it will be running to seed in May&mdash;when the roots from the European seed will be in their highest perfection.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>CELERY.</HEAD>
<P>Make choice of a fine dry day to earth up such celery as stand in need of it.&mdash;In per|forming this work great care should be taken that the earth do not fall into the hearts of the plants, by which it would greatly injure their growth, if not entirely destroy them.</P>
<P>Should severe weather now set in, let your plants which are in the ground be carefully protected from the frost, by laying straw or some other covering that may be most con|venient over the rows:&mdash;But if the ground should be very wet where your celery is planted, let some of the best of it be taken up and put into a dry, warm border, pretty thick, which you may take up for use when|ever required.</P>

<P>Gather the leaves up regular in your hand, and tie them together a little above the mid|dle, as close as possible, with a small moss band, or some strong bass matting; then with a small hoe draw up the earth close round the plants.</P>
<P>Should the weather prove severe and frosty, it would be very proper to take some of the plants from the beds that you have tied up; and let them be put into a south, dry border, in order that they may whiten.</P>
<P>In performing this work, take care that you do not cover the endive wholly over, but lay them into the earth within an inch of the tops of their leaves&mdash;and if the wea|ther should be very wet, it would be proper to lay a plank over the plants to protect them from the heavy rains which would otherwise perhaps cause them to rot.</P>

<HEAD>PRUNING YOUNG VINES THE FIRST YEAR AFTER PLANTING.</HEAD>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>PRUNING VINES THE SECOND YEAR AFTER PLANTING.</HEAD>
<P>As these vines were headed down very short the first year after planting, it is to be supposed that&punc; some of them have made three, four, and perhaps six fine and strong kindly shoots, eight or ten feet long.&mdash;These shoots, some over-wise people will lay in. six or eight feet the second year&mdash;but such practice I by no means approve of: for the running them out so long before the plants are well established in the ground, will weaken them so much, that with all the art you are possessed of, it will be three or four years before your young vines will have acquired sufficient strength to produce good wood, without which there will be no pros|pect
<PB N="178" REF="020722_0186_0FB0EDA07660CAA8">
of fine fruit; therefore let the shoots be shortened the second year also, to within four or five eyes of the last year's wood; and the third season they will with proper care cover an arbor eight feet wide and ten feet high, with fine fruit-bearing shoots.&mdash;By this treatment your vines will acquire pro|per strength, and may, probably produce some fine fruit the next summer.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="task">
<HEAD>PRUNING VINES THIRD YEAR AFTER PLANTING.</HEAD>
<P>By this time your vines will have acquired strength, if managed as before directed; and may have produced on each plant from eight to twelve fine bearing shoots, which should be also shortened according to their strength, leaving the strongest of them after pruned, at least five feet; and if very strong, six feet will not be too much.</P>
<P>Then let them be tied to the frame ten inches or a foot from each other:&mdash;Tho' this distance may seem great at this season, you will find your arbor compleatly shaded in the summer.&mdash;For the further manage|ment of these, I refer you to the next head on pruning old vines.</P>

<P><PB N="179" REF="020722_0187_0FB0EDA2E1A58A68">
In the first place let all the last summer's shoots which have sprung out of the old wood and branches be cut away; except in such particular places where they are abso|lutely wanted in the ensuing year: in such a case only they are to remain; but let them be shortened with two or three good eyes from the old wood.&mdash;By cutting the shoots so short it will be the means of their pro|ducing strong and kindly ones, which may probably prove fruitful the summer after next.</P>
<P>Observe in the next place, that all the short shoots which were suffered to remain in the last spring (for the purpose of bearing fruit only) should be now examined; and the most weakly and ill-placed of them be cut away; leaving the prosperous and most healthy shoots about ten or twelve inches from each other; and shortened so as not to have more than one or two good eyes (or as the gardener's call them spurs) to your vines; which will produce good fruit in the next season.</P>
<P>Thirdly and lastly, let all the shoots which were laid in the last summer, be carefully looked over; and all the side shoots from the principal bearing young branches be cut away quite close from whence they proceed; as they will neither bear good fruit, nor pro|duce good wood, being always of a rambling

and irregular growth.&mdash;This being done, shorten the shoots which are left, agreeable to the state and strength of each, as in the following manner.</P>
<P>Your young shoots will now require great attention, and must be shortened according|ly:&mdash;The most weakly should be cut back within three or four eyes of the old wood, in order to render them strong and healthy by the ensuing summer;&mdash;those of a mid|dling strength should be taken off within five or six eyes, whilst those that are strong and luxuriant may be (where there is sufficient room) permitted to remain with eight or twelve, and even from twelve to sixteen eyes; tho' let it be observed, that this treat|ment is only intended for old grown grape vines.</P>
