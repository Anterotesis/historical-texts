</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the Words of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. The occa&s;ion of them was this. One of the Com|pany &s;aid unto Him, <HI>Ma&s;ter, Speak to my Brother, that he divide the in|heritance with me.</HI> Some Expo&s;itors &s;uppo&s;e that he intended to injure his brother. How|ever that be, our Lord informs him that he came to a wrong Per&s;on, <HI>Man, Who made me a Judge, or a divider over you?</HI> Chri&s;t's Kingdom was not of this World, nor did He take to Him&s;elf a Civil Authority to judge, and di&s;po&s;e of Men's civil Rights and Pro|perties. No, He came into the World to Pur|cha&s;e an Heavenly Inheritance for His Peo|ple,
<PB N="2" REF="001997_0003_0FBA4F026790B538">and to give them a &s;ure Title to it; but not to Settle their Earthly Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Tho' He was the <HI>Lord and Heir of all things; yet He had not where to lay his head.</HI> And He calls upon His Di&s;ciples to be ready to for&s;ake all, and follow Him.</P>
<P>No doubt our Saviour di&s;cerned Cove|tous Worldly Spirit in this Man, who in|&s;tead of &s;eeking to Him about the Spiritual concerns of his Immortal Soul, was &s;o Eager to have Him concern him&s;elf in his temporal Affairs which was a thing forein from that great Errand upon which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the World. Our Saviour therefore takes this Opportunity to Caution his Hearers again&s;t <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s. Take heed,</HI> The Word <GAP DESC="foreign">is often referr'd to the Mind. It &s;ignifies, to behold with our bodily Eyes, and al&s;o with the Eye of the Soul, <HI>the Under|&s;tanding.</HI> To &s;ee a thing with Con&s;ideration, and Ob&s;ervation, to Know. And &s;ometimes it is rendred, Take heed, and <HI>Ob&s;erve your &s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Beware:</HI> The Word in the Ori|ginal &s;ignifies to keep Watch, to keep as a Pri&s;on is kept, to take heed or beware of "<HI>Pre&s;erve your &s;elves</HI> from <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. The word &s;ignifies; &s;ays <HI>Beza,</HI> an immoderate de&s;ire of getting, even with the Detriment of others. It is tran&s;lated, <HI>greedi|ne&s;s, Eph.</HI> 4.19. It &s;ignifieth an unlawful
<PB N="3" REF="001997_0004_0FBA4F13452DAB18">de&s;ire of having more; Word for Word, a <HI>having more.</HI> It is here tran&s;lated <HI>Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Which is <HI>an undue Valuation of,</HI> and <HI>immoderate craving this World's Goods.</HI> This Sin di&s;covers it &s;elf in an Exce&s;&s;ive E&s;teem of Worldly Riches, in an Idolatrous tru&s;t and confidence placed in them; in Un|righteous acts, and the taking unlawful Mea|&s;ures for the getting of Wealth; and in an immoderate Love to it, and delight in it when gotten; and a criminal backwardne&s;s and unwillingne&s;s to part with it to Pious, Publick, and Charitable U&s;es. It di&s;covers it &s;elf al&s;o in a Di&s;contentment with God's Allotment, and an irregular Endeavour after more than God-is pleas'd to allow us: In beholding our Neighbours E&s;tate with a Covetous Eye; <HI>our Eye being Evil becau&s;e God is good.</HI> It di&s;covers it &s;elf in an immo|derate Solicitude of Mind about getting and keeping; in an inordinate fear of lo&s;ing what we have gotten, and in exce&s;&s;ive grief upon the account of Worldly lo&s;&s;es and di&s;|appointments. This Sin di&s;covers it &s;elf in a Niggardly with-holding from our &s;elves that which is Meet for our comfortable and decent Sub&s;i&s;tence; and in with holding from others that which the Law of Charity re|quires us to be&s;tow upon them: or in the temper and di&s;po&s;ition with which we give; when we do it grudgingly, and not of a ready Mind.

<Q>It is a great Duty incumbent on us, to take heed, and beware of the Sin of Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</Q>
<P>Under this Doctrine, We may Con&s;ider what it is to take heed, and beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s. And then offer a few things to &s;hew the Obligations we are under to beware of this Sin.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What is it to take heed, and beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s?</HI> When may we be &s;aid to Obey this Command?</P>
<P>For an&s;wer to this Inquiry.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To take heed, and beware of Covetou&s;|ne&s;s implies, <HI>That we heedfully ob&s;erve the Temper of our Minds; and Examine whether this Lu&s;t doth not prevail in us.</HI>
<P>If we would take heed, and beware of this Evil, We mu&s;t ob&s;erve our &s;elves Care|fully; We mu&s;t compa&s;s a diligent Search, and look narrowly into the State of our Souls, and &s;eriou&s;ly Con&s;ider whether this I fi&s;t have not the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us. The Di&s;temper mu&s;t be known, the wound <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, before a pro|per Remedy can be applied. Our hearts are naturally <HI>deceitful, and de&s;parately wicked.</HI> A
<PB N="5" REF="001997_0006_0FBA4F1865404528">deceived heart oftentimes leads Men a&s;ide when they are not duely &s;en&s;ible of it. Par|ticularly, Men are very prone to flatter them|&s;elves in this iniquity. How often doth it lie hid under the Specious Names of <HI>Fruga|lity,</HI> and good Husbandry? How often are Men guilty of it under a fair pretence of a due concern about their Temporal Affairs? Certainly then if we would beware of this Sin, we mu&s;t turn the Eyes of the Soul in|ward, and by a reflex act of the Mind look and &s;ee whether this Lu&s;t doth not give Law to us in the Cour&s;e of our lives; or at lea&s;t, in &s;ome degree, prevail. We &s;hould Pray to God to Search us; and we &s;hould &s;earch and try our ways, that we may know if this way of wickedne&s;s be found in us. We mu&s;t put that general Rule into practice re&s;pecting this particular Ca&s;e; 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your &s;elves, &mdash; prove your own &s;eves. Know ye not your own &s;elves,</HI> &mdash; We &s;hould Examine by the rules of God's Word, whether our De&s;ire, E&s;teem and Tru&s;t be not inordinately plac'd on Worldly Riches; whether our hearts do not go out after them with too much Vehemency; and whether our pur&s;uit of them be not too Eager and Earne&s;t.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>We mu&s;t look to our &s;elves, and Watch a|gain&s;t the Fir&s;t Motion and Inclination of our hearts towards this dreadful Evil.</HI> We mu&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="001997_0007_0FBA4F235E563C40">watch that we may E&s;py and Suppre&s;s this hurtful Lu&s;t in the beginning and ri&s;e of it; that it may not Conceive and bring forth. We &s;hould labour to &s;tifle the&s;e Corrupt In|clinations in the birth, and not &s;uffer them to grow, and gather &s;trength. It is difficult to rai&s;e our Minds to heavenly things, and to &s;et our Affections on things above; but the de&s;cent is Ea&s;y, and the Motion of the Soul towards the Earth as it's Centre, will be &s;o much the Stronger and Swifter by how much the longer it is continued, and by how much the nearer we approach to it in our de|&s;ires and affections. Here then it is a good Rule, <HI>Ob&s;ta Principiis,</HI> Re&s;i&s;t this Sin in the beginning of it. And for this End we &s;hould be jealous over our &s;elves with a godly jea|lou&s;y.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>By the Grace of God, we mu&s;t Mortify the inward Inclination and Principle; that Root of bitterne&s;s whereby we are defiled.</HI>
<P>This is implied in the duty which we are here Exhorted to. There are the fruitful Seeds of all Sin in our Corrupt Natures. Our <HI>Ori|ginal Sin</HI> is the Root from whence all <HI>Actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions</HI> do Spring. Now we mu&s;t &s;trike at the Root. We mu&s;t Cry to God for the influences of His Holy Spirit to &s;ubdue our Corruptions. By the Spirit we mu&s;t Mortify the deads of the Fle&s;h, and change the corrupt
<PB N="7" REF="001997_0008_0FBA4F2604C02FC0">bia&s;s of our Minds, whereby we are inclin'd to this, and other Sins. Particular Lu&s;ts are as the Limbs or Members of that body of Death which is in us; and we mu&s;t by the Spirit Mortify them. Col. 3.5. <HI>Mortify therefore your Members which are upon the Earth;</HI> Fornication &mdash; and <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which is Idolatry. It is not enough that this Lu&s;t be <HI>Re&s;train'd</HI> as to the outward acts, and more Notorious out-breakings of it; but it mu&s;t be <HI>Crucified and Slain.</HI> It mu&s;t be put off, and laid a&s;ide. By looking to JESUS in the Exerci&s;e of Faith we &s;hould draw Strength from Him, who is our Head of Influence, to Subdue this Sin in the Principle of it, that it may not reign in our Mortal Bodies. We mu&s;t Pray that we may Experience the Power of Chri&s;t's death, this Sin being Nail'd to his Cro&s;s and Crucified with Him.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>We mu&s;t heedfully ob&s;erve our Temptations to this Sin, and beware of yielding to them.</HI>
<P>Many are the Temptations which our Sub|til Adver&s;ary the Devil makes u&s;e of to draw us into this Sin; and therefore we mu&s;t be Watchful, not being ignorant of his devices; and re&s;i&s;t him &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Faith. He that will carele&s;sly run into the way of Temptation, will be in the utmo&s;t Danger of being foil'd and over-come. Now there is no Condition or Circum&s;tance of Life that
<PB N="8" REF="001997_0009_0FBA4F27708E7F08">is Exempted from this Temptation. If we are ri&s;ing in the World, and have fulne&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s, we may be tempted to Con&s;ume too much of our Time and Tho'ts in the Eager pur&s;uit of Earthly things, under this pretence, that when we have gotten a great E&s;tate, We will then <HI>Seek the things which are Above:</HI> Whereas we are Commanded to &s;eek <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> the Kingdom of God, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And he that will not do this <HI>Pre&s;ently,</HI> hath no true de&s;ire to do it <HI>at all.</HI> We mu&s;t therefore Watch again&s;t &s;uch a Temptation as this. Again, If we have gotten <HI>an E&s;tate,</HI> Satan will be ready to tempt us <HI>to deny God,</HI> and to &s;ay, <HI>Who is the Lord?</HI> To make <HI>Idols</HI> of our Silver and Gold, and to bow down and wor&s;hip them. And thus al&s;o if we are <HI>Poor,</HI> Satan will be ready to take occa|&s;ion from hence to tempt us to Covet our Neighbours Goods; to <HI>Steal</HI> and <HI>take the Name of God in vain.</HI> This Lu&s;t is call'd the Lu&s;t of the <HI>Eye,</HI> and therefore we &s;hould make a <HI>Covenant with our Eyes,</HI> and beware of look|ing upon any thing that is our Neighbour's, with an Envious, Coveting Eye. We &s;hou'd Watch and Pray le&s;t we enter into this Temp|tation.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>We mu&s;t take heed, and beware of a Selfi&s;h Spirit; and Exerci&s;e our &s;elves in acts of Charity and Bounty.</HI>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001997_0010_0FBA4F28DE4C7070">
A Narrow contracted Spirit is in an e&s;pecial manner di&s;pos'd to this Vice. 2 Tim. 3.2. &mdash;<HI>Men &s;hall be lovers of their own &s;elves, Co|vetous,</HI> &mdash;! But now an heart inlarged in love to God and Men: an heart gene|rou&s;ly inclined to do good to others; will fly this ba&s;e Lu&s;t. Such a Man will be freely willing to lay out him&s;elf, and to &s;pend a &s;uitable proportion of his E&s;tate in doing good to others, in&s;tead of cleaving to it with an immoderate affection. As far as a &s;elfi&s;h Spirit prevails, we &s;hall think that lo&s;t, which we be&s;tow on our Neighbour; and &s;hall be ready to &s;eek our <HI>own,</HI> without a due regard to <HI>his</HI> profit; yea by doing wrong to him. Whereas we are Exhorted, 1 Cor. 10.24. <HI>Let no Man &s;eek his own, but every Man anothers Wealth.</HI> We mu&s;t therefore &s;eek after a con|trary frame of Mind, a liberal and charitable Spirit: and watch for &s;uitable opportunities to Exerci&s;e this Grace. We &s;hould devi&s;e liberal things, be ready to di&s;tribute, willing to communicate. The more the Grace of Charity is &s;trongthned in us, the more will this vile affection be weakned: for the&s;e are contrary.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>6. We mu&s;t take care to lay up our Trea&s;ure in Heaven.</HI>
<P>If we are diligent in the pur&s;uit of hea|venly
<PB N="10" REF="001997_0011_0FBA4F2AAF5F3A50">Riches, our hearts will in a good Mea|&s;ure, be rais'd above the things of this World; for <HI>where our Trea&s;ure is, there will our hearts be al&s;o.</HI> If we are <HI>Spiritually-Minded,</HI> we &s;hall &s;it loo&s;e from <HI>Earthly things.</HI> If we &s;et our Affections on things <HI>Above,</HI> we &s;hall take them off from things <HI>below.</HI> And therefore he that would beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t take off his Eyes from beholding Vanity, the Riches of this World, which peri&s;h in the u&s;ing; and look at the things which are not &s;een, which are Eternal. As far as our love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and our E&s;teem of his Un&s;earchable Riches, do prevail; &s;o far will our love of this World abate; and we &s;hall not &s;eek it with &s;o much Earne&s;tne&s;s and Greedine&s;s.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>7. We mu&s;t look to it, and improve the Means of Grace which GOD hath appointed to pre&s;erve us from this, and other Iniquities.</HI>
<P>There are Ordinances and Means of Grace appointed by God, in the diligent attendance upon which, the People of God are kept from falling, and pre&s;erved blamele&s;s to his heavenly Kingdom. The&s;e mu&s;t therefore be diligently improved. We mu&s;t look to it, and take heed that our worldly Cares and Bu&s;ine&s;s do not make us neglect them; or attend upon them in a cold and formal Man|ner. If we would beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="11" REF="001997_0012_0FBA4F3357A30E50">we mu&s;t &s;ee to it that we do not rob God, and defraud our own Souls, by not allowing Sufficient time for religious Duties. We &s;hould Read God's Word with Care, Attend upon the Preaching of it with Heedfulne&s;s and Con&s;tancy; not neglecting the A&s;&s;embling our &s;elves together for the Publick Wor&s;hip of God. P&s;al. 119.36. <HI>Incline my heart to thy Testimonies, and not to Coveton&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The&s;e two are here oppos'd, and therefore if we receive God's Word into good and hone&s;t hearts, we &s;hall be delivered from this ba&s;e Lu&s;t. If we would beware of Coretou&s;ne&s;s, we mu&s;t diligently husband the Precious Opportuni|ties, the Golden Sea&s;ons, which we enjoy on the Lord's Day: We &s;hould Watch, and take heed that we be not hindred by the hurries of Worldly bu&s;ine&s;s from <HI>Remembring the Sab|bath,</HI> and preparing for it. And thus we &s;hould al&s;o be careful to Attend on the Publick So|lemnities on other days, whether Stated or Oc|ca&s;ional. Again, We mu&s;t be in&s;tant in Prayer. We &s;hould go to the Throne of Grace daily in Secret Prayer, to ask Grace and Strength to help us again&s;t this, and other Iniquities. We &s;hould Cry to God that He would not lead us into Temptation to this Sin; but deliver us from this deadly Evil. We mu&s;t Watch al&s;o, and &s;ee to it that we re&s;erve Sufficient and Sea&s;onable Time for Family-Prayer. If we &s;uffer our Worldly bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hut out this <HI>Duty,</HI> the Spirit of
<PB N="12" REF="001997_0013_0FBA4F344EE873B8">the World hath already obtain'd a dreadful a&s;cendent over us, and will &s;till further prevail. Again, We &s;hould take Time to Meditate on what we Read or Hear. In a particular Man|ner, when we come from the Hou&s;e of God on the Lord's Day, it would be very profi|table for us to Retire, and Apply our Minds to the Truths we have heard, by clo&s;e Me|ditation; that the&s;e may be well dige&s;ted, and &s;o become Food and Nouri&s;hment to our Souls. To conclude this head, We &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider of the Vanity of all Earthly things, of the Shortne&s;s, and Uncertainty of the Time of this pre&s;ent Life, which is the Only Time wherein we can enjoy them. We &s;hould con&s;ider that our Worldly Goods are Talents lent to us by God, to be im|prov'd in His Service; and not to be con|&s;umed on our Lu&s;ts: And He will &s;hortly call us to a &s;trict Account what u&s;e we have made of them.

II. <HI>Why &s;hould we take heed and beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s? What Obligations are we under to beware of this Sin?</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>We mu&s;t beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Becau&s;e Covetou&s;ne&s;s is an hainous Iniguity, forbiden in the Law of God.</HI>
<P>Covetou&s;ne&s;s is in Scripture call'd Idolatry, and is rank'd with &s;ome of the mo&s;t atrocious Crimes. The <HI>Covetous Man &s;ays to Gold, Thou art my hope, and to fine Gold, Thon art my Confidence.</HI> In&s;tead of making the Name of the Lord his &s;trong Tower, he makes Riches his &s;trong City; and they are as an high Wall in his Conceit. He gives his Earthly Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions that E&s;teem and Love, which are due to God alone. Surely then this Sin is hainous in the Sight of God. And according|ly it is &s;trictly forbiden in His Word. The Tenth Commandment is, <HI>Thou &s;halt not Covet,</HI> &mdash;Eph. 5.3. But Fornication, and all Uncleanne&s;s, or <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> let it not be once named among&s;t you, as becometh Saints. This Sin is &s;o contrary to the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity; &s;o unbecoming the holy Voca|tion of Saints; that the Apo&s;tle would have them take care that it might not &s;o much as once be &s;aid that it was found among them.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="14" REF="001997_0015_0FBA4F38A34382F8">
2. <HI>Becau&s;e a Man's Life con&s;i&s;teth not in the Abundance of the things which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth.</HI>
<P>Thus it follows in the Ver&s;e wherein is our Text. This is the Argument which our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour makes u&s;e of to di&s;&s;wade His Di&s;ciples from this Sin; and there is great weight in it. The true Comfort of Life doth not flow from great Plenty, nor de|pend upon it. No, <HI>Nature is Content with a little.</HI> If we have Food and Raiment, we may live joyfully; provided the temper of out Minds be &s;uited to our Condition. The ground of true Peace, and good Living lies within; in a Spirit wean'd from the World, and re&s;ign'd to the Di&s;po&s;als of Providence. He is not the happy Man that hath a great Portion of the things of this World; but he that hath an heart to make a good u&s;e of that which he hath, and to take the Comfort of it. Now this is the Gi&s;t of God. Eccl. 3. 13. <HI>And al&s;o that every man &s;hould Eat and Drink, and Enjoy the</HI> good <HI>of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</HI> And this rich Gift is often befrowed on them that are not the Rich of this World; &s;o that the little which a Righteous Man hath is better to him than the abundance of many wicked.</P></ITEM>

<P><PB N="15" REF="001997_0016_0FBA4F41895EDD60">
Where this undue Valuation of Earthly Riches prevails, it E&s;trangeth the heart from God, and renders it Earthly, Sen&s;ual, Devili&s;h. It indi&s;po&s;eth the Mind to all that is Spiritual|ly good, and fills it with corrupt De&s;ires and vile Affections; Our worldly gain doth then become <HI>filthy lucre.</HI> We read, Mark 7.21. &amp; 23. <HI>From within, out of the heart of men proceed evil Thoughts, Adulteries, Fornications, Murders, Thefts, Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;All the&s;e Evil things come from within, and de&s;ile the Man. O Polluted Soul that lie&s;t grovelling in the du&s;t: How art thou deba&s;ed! How art thou de&s;iled! And this Lu&s;t leads to the Commi&s;&s;ion of other Sins. 1 Tim. 6.9. <HI>But they that will be rich, fall into Temptation, and a &s;nare, and into many fooli&s;h and hurtful lu&s;ts:</HI>&mdash;The immoderate de&s;ire of Wealth many times prevails on Men to Lie, Steal, Oppre&s;s &amp; Over-reach their Neighbours. Yes, &s;ometimes to Murder them. Thus when <HI>Athan</HI> &s;aw the goodly Babyloni&s;h Garment, and Two hundred. Shekels of Silver, and a Wedge of Gold; he Coveted, and took them, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> 7. 21. Thus <HI>Ahab</HI> Coveted <HI>Naboth</HI>'s Vineyard, and &s;lew him.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>If we are under the government of this Sin We &s;hall de&s;pi&s;e and reject the Offers of the Go&s;pel.</HI>
<P>In the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel, peri&s;hing Sinners have the Un&s;earchable Riches of Chri&s;t hid open, and freely offered to them upon the
<PB N="16" REF="001997_0017_0FBA4F429FE880B8">mo&s;t rea&s;onable Terms. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t calls upon us to come to Him, that we may obtain <HI>durable Riches and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> He hath purcha&s;ed Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ings &s;uited and proportion'd to the Wants of our Souls; and offers to be&s;tow them upon all &s;uch as are willing to receive them in the Go&s;pel-way. He calls upon us to Come and <HI>Buy without Money, and without Price.</HI> But that man who&s;e heart goeth out after his Covetou&s;ne&s;s, will have no heart, no inclination to Come and receive the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings. When invited to come to Chri&s;t, and fea&s;t on that Provi&s;ion which He hath made, he will &s;ay, in his heart at lea&s;t, I mu&s;t go to my Farm, to my Merchandize; pray have me Excus'd. Or if he doth come and &s;it under the Outward Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Word, yet he will not truly Come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t that he may have Life. His ca&s;e will be like that of the Young man, who, when Com|manded to Sell that he had, and give to the Poor, <HI>Went away &s;orrowful,</HI> Matth. 19.23. Now we mu&s;t in the frame and temper of our Minds be ready to lay down all our Temporal Intere&s;ts at Chri&s;t's feet; or we can't be His Di&s;ciples. Luke 14.33.&mdash;<HI>Who&s;oever he be of you, that for|&s;aketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Di&s;|ciple.</HI> But how &s;hall we be able to do this while the World hath the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our hearts? It is as ea&s;y for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle. <HI>We can't &s;erve God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> While we pant after the
<PB N="17" REF="001997_0018_0FBA4F43D5AD6870">du&s;t of the Earth, we cannot hunger &amp; thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s; we &s;hall not obey the Go&s;pel-call, and &s;eek <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> the Kingdom of God. If this Lu&s;t prevails, it will choke the good Seed of the Word, &s;o that we &s;hall not bring forth fruit to perfection. Matth. 13.22. <HI>He that received Seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the Word, and the care of this World, and the deceitfulne&s;s of Riches choke the Word, and he becometh unfruitful.</HI> Worldly minded men may have &s;ome good Motions, &s;ome Convictions in hearing God's Word; but then alas! this treacherous Lu&s;t renders them fruitle&s;s and in|effectual.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>This Sin will Expo&s;e us to Sorrow in this Life, and if per&s;i&s;ted in, to Eternal Mi&s;ery in the World to come.</HI>
<P>1. Tim. 6.10. <HI>For the love of Money is the root of all Evil; which while &s;ome coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced them&s;elves through with many &s;orrows.</HI> There is a Wo de|nounced again&s;t &s;uch as live in this Sin: Wo to him that Coveteth an Evil Covetou&s;ne&s;s:&mdash; There are many who by their greedy pur&s;uit of worldly gain do pierce them&s;elves through with many Sorrows. God is provok'd to bla&s;t them in their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, or to Cur&s;e their ble&s;&s;ings. And in the conclu&s;ion they will be Mi&s;erable indeed. When the Covetous man may be ready to ble&s;s him&s;elf with the rich
<PB N="18" REF="001997_0019_0FBA4F458270DCD8">Fool, and to &s;ay, Soul thou haft much goods laid up for many Years; take thine Ea&s;e, Eat, Drink and be Merry; then GOD may &s;ay, Thou Fool this Night &s;hall thy Soul be requi|red of thee, <HI>For &s;o is he that layeth up Trea&s;ure for him&s;elf; and is not Rich towards God.</HI> By this Sin the Souls of Multitudes have been plung'd into Perdition. The Laws of Men do not puni&s;h this Abominable Vice; but tho' &s;uch Sinners may E&s;cape the Puni&s;hment of Men, yet they can't E&s;cape the righteous Judgment of God. O No! They that live and die un|der the guilt and dominion of this Sin, mu&s;t be &s;hut out of Heaven, and &s;uffer the venge|geance of Eternal fire. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.5, 6. For this ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor-Un|clean per&s;on, nor <HI>Covetous man who is an I|dolater, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of God.</HI> Let no Man deceive you with vain Words; for becau&s;e of the&s;e things cometh the Wrath of God upon the Children of di&s;obedience. And Riches will not profit in that day of Wrath.</P></ITEM>

<P N="1">USE, I. Learn hence, <HI>The Folly of &s;uch as take no Care to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the Sin of Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The Wi&s;dom or Folly of Men is very much
<PB N="19" REF="001997_0020_0FBA4F485C4EBFF8">di&s;cover'd in the judgment and e&s;timate which they make of things. Surely then every Co|vetous Per&s;on deferres that appellation, <HI>Thou Fool!</HI> For they prefer Earth before Hea|ven, the vain &s;hort-liv'd Enjoyments of this Life before Sub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings; the things that are not, before Eternal Realitics. Their way is their Folly. Such may think them&s;elves <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> in their Generation, but their Egregious <HI>Folly</HI> appears in the value which they put on Worldly Riches. They prefer the du&s;t of the Earth before the Pearl of great Price. They Sell their Souls for very nought. <HI>For what &s;hall it profit a Man if he &s;hall gain the whole World, and lo&s;e his Soul? Or what &s;hall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI> O that &s;uch might be Convinced of their folly before it be too late!</P>
<P N="2">II. Learn, <HI>That the Prevalency of this Sin calls for Humiliation and Lamentation.</HI></P>
<P>It is Lamentable indeed to &s;ee how much a Worldly Spirit prevails among us, and that notwith&s;tanding the many frowns of GOD upon us in our Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s. Alas! alas! How apt are we to have our Hearts full of the World; to be cumbered about many things, &s;o as to neglect the <HI>One Thing Need|ful?</HI> How apt are we to be over much con|cern'd about what we &s;hall Eat and Drink, and where-withal we &s;hall be Cleathed; and
<PB N="20" REF="001997_0021_0FBA4F516036EED8">at the &s;ame time to be cold and indifferent in the great Concerns of our Souls? Alas! There are many who do not take heed, and beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and hence it is in a great Mea&s;ure that we grow &s;o Carele&s;s in the great Matters of Religion. Many are very Hot and Eager in their pur&s;uit of the World, and therefore Slothful in bu&s;ine&s;s, and <HI>Not fervent in Spirit, &s;erving the Lord.</HI> Is not a Glorious SAVIOUR lightly E&s;teem'd? Are not the precious Privileges of the Go&s;pel Low-priz'd Commodities with many? O that our Heads were Waters, and our Eyes a fountain of Tears. that we might weep Day and Night for this! O that we could Mourn with &s;uch a godly Sorrow as &s;hall work in us a Repentance never to be repented of! The Lord Rain down Righteou&s;ne&s;s upon us, and Revive His Work in the mid&s;t of us! The Lord pour out His Holy Spirit upon us, and help us to Seek the Things that are Above more ge|nerally, more fervently. This mu&s;t bring on the golden Age which we are looking and waiting for.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Let us all be Exhorted to take beed, and beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Sin which doth Ea&s;ily <HI>be&s;et us,</HI> and it is of very fatal Con&s;equence. O let us then be prevail'd with to <HI>Ob&s;erve</HI> our &s;elves, and to u&s;e our Earne&s;t Endeavours to
<PB N="21" REF="001997_0022_0FBA4F5519B4A488"><HI>Pre&s;erve</HI> our &s;elves from this Vice! We mu&s;t by the Grace of God Mortify and Subdue this Lu&s;t, or it will prove ruinous and de&s;tructive to us. Let us then Cry to God that He would vanqui&s;h this Enemy of our Salvation.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch as are under the Government of this, and other Iniquities, be Exhorted to break off their Sins by Repentance. Be Earne&s;t with God to clean&s;e you from this and all other Sins; to heal your Souls; and parti|cularly to Cure this Di&s;temper. You are de&s;titute of true Grace, and can't Engage in this great Duty you are Exhorted to, unle&s;s GOD by His Almighty Power Change the bia&s;s and temper of your Minds.</P>
<P>Let the Children of God be more Careful and Watchful over them&s;elves. <HI>Keep your Hearts with all diligence,</HI> and beware of all approaches towards this Sin. If you would keep your &s;elves in the Love of GOD, you mu&s;t not love the World, neither the things that are in the World.</P>
<P>To Conclude, Let them that are <HI>Rich</HI> in this World, take heed that they do not <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in uncertain Riches; but in the Living GOD, who giveth us all things richly to Enjoy: That they do good, that they be Rich in Good Works, ready to di&s;tribute, willing

<P>Let the <HI>Poor</HI> of the Flock Tru&s;t in the Lord and do good, and verily they &s;hall be fed. Heb. 13.5. <HI>Let your Conver&s;ation be with|out Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and be content with &s;uch things as ye have; for He hath &s;old, I will never leave thee, nor for&s;ake thee.</HI></P>
