<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Di&s;cour&s;es were taken in &s;hort hand at the time of delivery, by a per&s;on not in the &s;ame religious community with the preacher. A few nece&s;&s;ary corrections of gram|matical inaccuracies have been &s;ince made; and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, a more complete citation of the texts adduced. In quotations made from memory, it mu&s;t frequently happen that the words are not quite exact. It &s;ufficiently an&s;|wered the &s;peaker's purpo&s;e if the general import of the pa&s;&s;age was conveyed; and expre&s;&s;ions, which thus qualify the citation, are frequently introduced, and always to be implied.</P>
<P>It is well known that the mini&s;ters of the reli|gious &s;ociety, with whom the author of the&s;e
<PB N="iv" REF="027217_0003_0FD3E23D37D4A9E0">
Di&s;cour&s;es profe&s;&s;ed, di&s;claim all previous &s;tudy in the compo&s;ition of their extemporaneous &s;er|mons. It cannot, therefore, be expected that they &s;hould be exact in methodical arrangement, or abound in the embelli&s;hments of modern elo|quence. What was not attempted it is no di&s;|grace not to have attained. It may, however, perhaps, ju&s;tly be a matter of doubt, whether that zeal and energy of delivery, which ari&s;e from the feelings of the moment, may not, in their effects on the audience, more than counterbalance the cool correctne&s;s of &s;tudied oratory. The Qua|kers lay down few dogmas, and &s;eldom enlarge on tho&s;e my&s;terious points of theology which have &s;o much divided the Chri&s;tian world, and have mo&s;tly occa&s;ioned contention in proportion to their ob&s;curity. The doctrine of univer&s;al grace, of which a manife&s;tation, or portion, is given to every man, and by obedience to which he is enabled to fulfil his duty, and to walk ac|ceptably with his Creator, is the leading princi|ple of that &s;ociety, who hold, as the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of it, that true wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts in a hum|ble pro&s;tration of heart and communion of &s;pirit with the Father of mercies, and is therefore per|fectly
<PB N="v" REF="027217_0004_0FD3E23F87DEA600">
con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of &s;ilence. The&s;e points are inculcated in the following pages, perhaps, to a degree of tautology, for which an extract from one of the Di&s;cour&s;es, in the preach|er's own words, may furni&s;h the be&s;t excu&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>Though it is probable that what I have &s;ometimes delivered may have been more or le&s;s &s;imilar to that which I have aforetime de|livered, yet I hope that even a repetition of doctrines and advices, which we are urged to deliver from a &s;en&s;e of duty, may not be as water &s;pilt upon a &s;tone, but may have a ten|dency (if not to convey any material informa|tion to the under&s;tanding) to &s;tir up at lea&s;t the pure mind by way of remembrance.</Q></P>
<P>The love of fame, taken as a general principle, and including the de&s;ire of being e&s;teemed and approved by one's friends, frequently mingles it&s;elf with our be&s;t motives. But, though this pa&s;&s;ion may, in a public preacher, receive &s;ome gratification from the &s;ilent and &s;olemn attention of the hearers, it would &s;carcely excite a prudent man to expect any increa&s;e of reputation from the publication of Di&s;cour&s;es, of which the &s;ub|ject and arrangement were not preconceived,
<PB N="vi" REF="027217_0005_0FD3E2427A144D28">
and the expre&s;&s;ions &s;uch as were &s;ugge&s;ted at the in&s;tant. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, at lea&s;t, no imputation of this &s;ort can ari&s;e to the author of the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, who is removed from the &s;cene, and the influence of all earthly pa&s;&s;ions. The apology for the pre&s;ent publication re&s;ts on the hope that impre&s;&s;ions of a &s;alutary nature may, by this means, be renewed on &s;uch minds as are &s;incerely de&s;irous of fulfilling the duties of their &s;tation, and of reaching the haven of eternal re&s;t.</P>
<P>A friend of the author has favoured us with the following brief account of him.</P>
<P>Thomas Letchworth was born at Woodbridge, in the county of Suffolk, in the year 1739. His parents were of the people called Quakers, and his father, a trade&s;man in that town, was a preacher among them. In that religious &s;ociety, the earnings of hone&s;t indu&s;try are thought to be a mode of maintenance more con&s;i&s;tent with the evangelical qualifications required in a Chri&s;|tian Mini&s;ter, and with the influence he ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s in his congregation, than legal &s;tipends or gratuitous contributions, which too fre|quently occa&s;ion contention in the one in&s;tance, or dependence in the other. He received from
<PB N="vii" REF="027217_0006_0FD3E24307C5E610">
his father, who had a numerous family, the com|mon education of a boarding-&s;chool at Hartford, and was afterwards put apprentice to a linen-draper at Epping. In the early part of his life, he was of a con&s;umptive habit; and this imper|fect &s;tate of his health probably con&s;pired with a di&s;po&s;ition, naturally reflective and &s;erious, to impre&s;s on his mind a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the vanity of human de&s;ires, and the importance of reli|gious duty. Before he was twenty years of age, he began his mini&s;terial &s;ervices, in which he was particularly de&s;irous to inculcate on the minds of young people a frequent con&s;ideration of their latter end, and of the awful concerns of futurity. His Di&s;cour&s;es were copious, ani|mated, and pathetic; but, perhaps, not altoge|ther free from a certain inflation of language, to which men of fervid imaginations, in expre&s;&s;ing their fir&s;t conceptions, are frequently &s;ubject. His &s;ervices were, however, mo&s;tly acceptable, and he &s;pent a con&s;iderable portion of his time in vi&s;iting different parts of the country on a religious account. At this period, he kept a &s;hop in Cri&s;pin-&s;treet, Spital-fields, whence he removed to Ampthill, in Bedford&s;hire, but after|wards
<PB N="viii" REF="027217_0007_0FD3E244B6098EA0">
returned to London, in which city, or its vicinity, he continued to re&s;ide till near his de|cea&s;e.</P>
<P>He was not much conver&s;ant in the learned languages, but his reading in his native tongue was pretty exten&s;ive. Hi&s;tory, natural philo&s;o|phy, the rudiments of medicine and anatomy, the leading principles of a&s;tronomy, and even the charms of poetry, furni&s;hed him with matter of meditation and amu&s;ement in his lei&s;ure hours. But his favourite &s;tudy was the my&s;terious oper|ations of the human mind, the pa&s;&s;ions which actuate it, the nature of its union with the body, the rea&s;onable hope of its immortality, the prin|ciples of identity, liberty, nece&s;&s;ity, and all tho&s;e branches which con&s;titute the &s;ublime but ob|&s;cure &s;cience of metaphy&s;ics. He was well ver&s;ed in mo&s;t of the writers on the&s;e &s;ubjects; nor did the different opinions of religious &s;ects, both in his own and in former periods of hi&s;tory, e&s;cape his clo&s;e examination. The <HI>dernier result</HI> of his inquiries may be learned from the following paper, found among his manu&s;cripts with that very title; and it were to be wi&s;hed that every inquiry and controver&s;y concerning &s;uch &s;ubjects
<PB N="ix" REF="027217_0008_0FD3E24644EC6810">
might terminate in the &s;ame humble and liberal manner.</P>
<P><Q>From an hone&s;t intention of acting con&s;i&s;t|ently with the relation I bear to God, my Ma|ker, and to my fellow-creatures, I have care|fully reviewed mo&s;t of the religious &s;entiments, on tho&s;e &s;ubjects, held by any &s;ociety of men in the known world. I have put a period to my re&s;earches into the books and opinions of men, and have concluded to re&s;ign my&s;elf in future to the guidance of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations which I feel to increa&s;e my love to God and to man|kind, and to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures of conduct in religion and morality, the pro&s;ecution of which gives me the mo&s;t peace; and to judge no man, neither pretend to exalt my opinions and practices to judge of the rectitude of other men's by. Let others do as they will, as for me I will endeavour to &s;eek peace and en&s;ue it. A man cannot be happy, whatever notions or opinions he may hold, or whatever mea&s;ures of conduct he may pur&s;ue, unle&s;s, in the holding of &s;uch opinions, and in being found in the pro&s;ecution of &s;uch mea&s;ures, he feels him&s;elf ea&s;y and comforted at heart. Let this rule
<PB N="x" REF="027217_0009_0FD3E24811622260">
of my future conduct be termed erroneous, defective, an illu&s;ion, or what not&mdash;it is the be&s;t rule of my faith and manners which I have been able to find after a clo&s;e inquiry of fifteen years. <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, on earth peace, and good-will to men,</HI> is, and I hope ever will be, the language of my &s;oul. Amen.</Q></P>
<P>At what time this &s;ummary of his re&s;earches was written does not appear; probably &s;ome years before his decea&s;e. The following extracts from three letters, written to a friend during his la&s;t illne&s;s, the two latter a &s;hort time before his death, will &s;hew that the&s;e &s;entiments retained their impre&s;&s;ion to the la&s;t: they will &s;hew that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed what, in &s;uch moments, it is better to po&s;&s;e&s;s than the trea&s;ures of the rich or the knowledge of the learned, a &s;pirit of re&s;ignation and peace, and a humble but earne&s;t hope in the mercies of the Almighty.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Fourteenth of the twelfth month,</HI> 1783. I am now better than when thou lefte&s;t me. My little bark &s;prang a leak &s;ome months ago, which gradually gained on the pump until every effort to &s;ave her &s;eemed to be made in vain, and de&s;truction &s;eemed inevitable. The
<PB N="xi" REF="027217_0010_0FD3E24912A0EFA8">
moment was awful, but not fearful. I felt an entire re&s;ignation to the appointment of our heavenly Father. I have not to tell of being lifted up to extacy in vi&s;ions, nor of my fears having been alarmed by any terrific dreams. To God, my Maker, I looked &s;ingly. My de|pendence was fixed on him alone. A &s;ober, humbling &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ence and providence prevented fear, and in&s;pired hope.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Eleventh of the ninth month,</HI> 1784. I find my&s;elf &s;till lo&s;ing fle&s;h, and rather weaker, but, in &s;ome other re&s;pects, rather better. I know not what to think. Here I am
<LG>
<L>"Safe in the hands of one di&s;po&s;ing Power,</L>
<L>"Or in the natal, or the mortal, hour,"</L>
</LG>
enjoying every gleam of &s;un&s;hine to the utmo&s;t, and bearing, with as much patience and re&s;ig|nation as po&s;&s;ible, the cloudy days and &s;tarle&s;s nights &s;ometimes allotted me under the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Twenty-eighth of the tenth month,</HI> 1784. This di&s;order has much reduced my fle&s;h and my &s;trength; but I am &s;carcely in any pain; nor am I &s;en&s;ible at pre&s;ent of any &s;ymptom which threatens any. The account I received by thy
<PB N="xii" REF="027217_0011_0FD3E24AC9E9A0D0">
letter of our friend ****** affected me much. We &s;eem to be in a &s;imilar weak &s;tate, and as it were di&s;&s;olving apace into the earth whence we originally &s;prang; for, <HI>du&s;t thou art, and to du&s;t thou &s;halt return:</HI> and, whenever we die, whether &s;oon or late, I hope we &s;hall have an un&s;haken tru&s;t in the common Father of us all, and re&s;ign to the common lot of all fle&s;h with compo&s;ure and without regret. Remember me not as a for&s;aken and mi&s;erable man, for I enjoy even now, and &s;uffer but little, very lit|tle, comparatively &s;peaking. I rejoice in the good providence of God, which is over us all continually for our good, and is alike gracious to all his creatures in what he gives and what he denies them. And, in all the di&s;pen&s;ations of his wi&s;dom, let us tru&s;t in him, our com|mon Father, Protector, and Friend.</Q></P>
<P>He at length gradually &s;unk under the &s;low but irre&s;i&s;tible force of a con&s;umption, and de|parted on the 7th of the eleventh month (No|vember) 1784, at the hou&s;e of a friend at New|bury, in Berk&s;hire. From the foregoing account of the &s;tate of his mind, it is almo&s;t needle&s;s to add, that he met death with a becoming and
<PB N="xiii" REF="027217_0012_0FD3E24C7432DE88">
humble fortitude. He was interred, at his own reque&s;t, in the Quakers burial-ground at Read|ing, on the 14th of the month above-mentioned; and his funeral was attended by a great number of his friends, who were de&s;irous of te&s;tifying their e&s;teem for his memory by this la&s;t mark of attention.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred writ which has been revived in my remembrance dur|ing the &s;ilence of this meeting; and the train of reflections which it excited has &s;ealed in&s;truction to my mind, and furni&s;hed me with renewed cau&s;e for humiliation and gratitude. The im|port of it is this: <HI>Men and brethren, what &s;hall we do to be saved?</HI></P>
<P>No per&s;on, who &s;eriou&s;ly believes in the ex|i&s;tence of a God, in a future &s;tate, and in the awful doctrine of rewards and puni&s;hments, can be indifferent re&s;pecting what may be his lot, when he &s;hall be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this frail taber|nacle
<PB N="16" REF="027217_0014_0FD3E256169D5A38">
of clay which he now inhabits, and which is approaching to the period of its di&s;&s;olution. It cannot be a matter of indifference to him, whether he &s;hall finally receive the irrevocable &s;entence of <HI>Go, ye cursed,</HI> into the regions of un|&s;peakable mi&s;ery; or, <HI>Come, ye blessed of my Fa|ther,</HI> inherit the kingdom prepared for the right|eous&mdash;enter thou into the joy of thy Lord, and into thy Ma&s;ter's re&s;t.</P>
<P>This concern has prompted many to inquire what is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for them to believe and practi&s;e, in order to render them&s;elves the proper objects of divine complacence, and fur|ni&s;h them with a well-grounded hope of a happy and glorious immortality.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t and &s;incere, in every nation under heaven, have formed different ideas of the requi|&s;ites of &s;alvation; and they have, of cour&s;e, pur|&s;ued as different mea&s;ures to accompli&s;h that de|&s;irable and ble&s;&s;ed end.</P>
<P>It does not appear to be my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to particulari&s;e any of the various &s;y&s;tems of faith which are adopted by any party among&s;t mankind. It is not to controvert matters in which &s;incere men of various denominations
<PB N="17" REF="027217_0015_0FD3E25752EE40A0">
mo&s;t &s;urely believe; but rather to recommend them to &s;tand open always to conviction, and to a &s;trict attention to tho&s;e rules of conduct, which, on an impartial examination, appear to them mo&s;t agreeable to the will of Heaven. I &s;hall therefore addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e, in what|ever religious &s;ociety they are found, who&s;e hon|e&s;t inquiries have not yet been attended with &s;ufficient conviction&mdash;have not yet led them clearly to perceive what the terms are, on which their future happine&s;s depends, and who are therefore looking one upon another, whil&s;t this important que&s;tion is found at lea&s;t in their <HI>hearts,</HI> if not in their mouths, <HI>Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved?</HI> An inquiry of this &s;olemn nature, ari&s;ing from a proper &s;en&s;ibility of the want of better in&s;truction, is an indica|tion of that concern and holy anxiety, which will ever be acceptable to the Father of &s;ure Mercies. He regards &s;uch humble inquirers af|ter truth and peace with him, with gracious con|de&s;cen&s;ion; and, if they rely on the guidance of his Spirit, will finally conduct them to his glo|rious re&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pre&s;ume arrogantly to dictate to
<PB N="18" REF="027217_0016_0FD3E258CD74E688">
any, re&s;pecting matters of &s;o important a con|cern as that of the &s;oul's &s;alvation. Every man &s;hould exerci&s;e tho&s;e talents and gifts, with which the Father of Lights has endued him, in a clo&s;e and &s;incere attention to the voice of the in|ternal teacher, and in the di&s;covery of tho&s;e truths, both practical and &s;peculative, which have an immediate relation to the happine&s;s of a being circum&s;tanced as he is. I &s;hall &s;imply propo&s;e tho&s;e things which, in my view, and from my own experience as an individual, appear to me worthy of God for their author, and worthy of man's mo&s;t &s;erious attention.</P>
<P>It is an indi&s;putable truth that we made not our&s;elves: <HI>It is he that hath made us,</HI> &s;aid the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>and not we ourselves,</HI> for <HI>we are also his offspring.</HI> The matter which forms the univer&s;e, the vehicles which the &s;oul informs, and the more noble intellectual powers and faculties we po&s;&s;e&s;s, derive their being from the eternal Fountain of all power and intelligence, whom we characteri&s;e by the awful names of Jah, Jehovah, and God. It is al&s;o indi&s;putably evident to me, that we were brought into exi&s;tence with the benevolent de&s;ign of our finally &s;u&s;taining the confluent
<PB N="19" REF="027217_0017_0FD3E25A630F28A0">
dignities of glory, honour, immortality, and eter|nal life. The Lord Almighty hath, in un&s;peak|able mercy, de&s;igned, that, after we have endured a &s;ea&s;on of probation, a conflict with our pa&s;|&s;ions, excited by numerous cau&s;es, and a fight of afflictions, we &s;hould finally receive a glorious reward, a perpetuity of unmixed felicity, in the regions of eternity.</P>
<P>But this de&s;irable and excellent end is not to be effected by what is generally called Fate, the laws of nece&s;&s;ity, or the arbitrary will, power, or decree, of the Author of our exi&s;tence. God hath, in his wi&s;dom, con&s;tituted us free and in|telligent beings. He has endued us with facul|ties and powers capable of apprehending and practi&s;ing tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential duties which he makes the condition of our final acceptance with him. He offers, but does not impo&s;e; he graciou&s;ly invites, but does not compel, us to accept of hap|pine&s;s. He &s;hews us the &s;piritual Canaan, the land of the &s;aints inheritance, in every generation: he gives us power to po&s;&s;e&s;s, but does not compel us to enter therein. Good and evil are clearly &s;et before us, but our election is not con&s;trained to either. The econ|omy
<PB N="20" REF="027217_0018_0FD3E25BD2B89270">
of his moral government over rational beings is laid in divine wi&s;dom and eternal righteou&s;|ne&s;s. The great Sovereign of the univer&s;e is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons; for, of one blood hath he made all nations that dwell on the face of the earth. They &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to the univer&s;al Father, Shepherd, and Bi&s;hop, of &s;ouls, who tenderly invites the whole race of mankind to come unto him that they may finally inherit the joy of his &s;alvation. O un&s;peakable mercy! unutterable theme! It is &s;ufficient to awaken the mo&s;t glowing &s;en&s;ations of exalted and grate|ful prai&s;e to that God who is the &s;alvation and glory of the righteous generations, <HI>the rock of their &s;trength, and their everla&s;ting refuge.</HI></P>
<P>To this doctrine the holy apo&s;tle bore an ample and explicit te&s;timony: <HI>Of a truth</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but, in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we find that it is the fear of the Lord, and an obedience to the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which are the terms alone by which men can be &s;aved. <HI>If ye live after the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall die; but, if ye, through the spirit, mortify the deeds of the body,
<PB N="21" REF="027217_0019_0FD3E25C88E73C60">
ye &s;hall live.</HI> This is a propo&s;ition of univer&s;al importance; a propo&s;ition which relates to every individual in the va&s;t community of mankind, however circum&s;tanced, whether bond or free, rich or poor, or in whatever climate they re&s;ide.</P>
<P>All this may, indeed, be acknowledged both by tho&s;e within and without the audience of my voice, who yet are in doubt <HI>what they &s;hall do to be saved</HI> with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation. They want to be informed of the preci&s;e ideas that &s;hould be affixed to the conditions contained in the text; although, perhaps, they readily apprehend that the terms <HI>life</HI> and <HI>death</HI> mean future happine&s;s and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore attempt, according to the ability I am endued with at this &s;ea&s;on, to give you my thoughts on the important &s;ubject under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>To live after the fle&s;h</HI> is to live in the gratifica|tion of our animal appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, beyond the bounds of rea&s;on, temperance, and &s;obriety. All the works of darkne&s;s, which, by the &s;ame apo&s;tle, are termed <HI>deeds of the body,</HI> all pride, wrath, envy, hatred, covetou&s;ne&s;s, with all the deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, are, in other
<PB N="22" REF="027217_0020_0FD3E2615A7C8480">
words, <HI>living after the fle&s;h.</HI> The&s;e things not only tend to the injury of peace and &s;ociety, and are a bane to that happine&s;s which is the re&s;ult of genuine virtue even in this life; not only in|troduce numerous errors into the animal and moral &s;y&s;tem, and aggravate the infirmities to which the&s;e bodies are incident, but render us unfit for tho&s;e contemplations, and that &s;upreme felicity, which are adapted to the dignity of ra|tional and immortal &s;pirits. God, in his wi&s;dom, hath made man a little (and perhaps but a little) lower than the angels. He has endued him with a capacity for contemplating and adoring him, the &s;ource of uncreated excellence and perfection, and would crown him with &s;uperior honour, glory, and happine&s;s, to what &s;en&s;ual gratifica|tions can ever afford. Let us not then degrade our&s;elves beneath that rank we were de&s;igned to fill in creation, but remember our immortal de&s;|cent, the cau&s;e of our being, and its end.</P>
<P>We have, indeed, bodies, and are impri&s;oned within elements, which excite within us nume|rous appetites, affections, and pa&s;&s;ions; but all the&s;e are to be gratified within certain bounds, in a degree proportioned to our exigences and
<PB N="23" REF="027217_0021_0FD3E264F214B590">
nece&s;&s;ities, of which the &s;upreme intelligence has implanted a principle within us to judge.</P>
<P>This principle of intelligence, although called by a variety of names, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by va|rious appellations in the various profe&s;&s;ions among&s;t men, is one in nature, and univer&s;al among&s;t mankind. It is the &s;pirit in man that giveth a right under&s;tanding: it is the light that (more or le&s;s) enlightens every man: it is the word of God in the heart, and the word of faith which the apo&s;tle preached to the Gentiles: it is the grace that hath appeared unto all men, teach|ing them to deny all ungodline&s;s and the world's lu&s;ts, and to live righteously, &s;oberly, and godly, in this pre&s;ent world: and, finally, it is the &s;u|preme rea&s;on, the law of truth and rectitude, the te&s;t of virtue and vice, which God him&s;elf hath placed in the hearts of all men; and happy are tho&s;e who hear and obey it in all things.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to mean that this principle, of which I am &s;peaking, is de&s;igned to in&s;truct us in all truths which the human mind may, in its own activity and wi&s;dom, attempt to inve&s;tigate; or to give us a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;ight into tho&s;e numerous &s;peculative &s;ubjects, which have
<PB N="24" REF="027217_0022_0FD3E2665BEC1DF8">
not only unprofitably employed mankind, and diverted their attention from things more &s;ub|&s;tantial, but which have perplexed and divided them from generation to generation.</P>
<P>But by the exerci&s;e of this pure, holy, hea|venly, principle, we may apprehend tho&s;e truths which belong to us, and which have an e&s;&s;ential relation to the prime end of our being. Of the&s;e truths the Father of Spirits has con&s;tituted man an adequate judge.</P>
<P>This is implied by the que&s;tion which our Lord him&s;elf propo&s;ed to a people misled by the traditions of their fathers, and who had, through the neglect of this principle, taken for doctrine the commandments of men: <HI>Yea, and why, even of yourselves, judge ye not what is right?</HI></P>
<P>The obligation to all our &s;ocial, relative, and religious, duties, ari&s;es from the relations we &s;tand in to our fellow-creatures and to God, the holy author of our exi&s;tence. The general rela|tion, which our fellow creatures &s;tand in to us, is that of brethren, children of the &s;ame univer&s;al parent, &s;ubject to the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ities, and formed for the &s;ame un&s;peakably glorious and happy end. Hence it is our duty to exerci&s;e the amiable
<PB N="25" REF="027217_0023_0FD3E267D4AB7D18">
virtues of love, forbearance, kindne&s;s, and cha|rity, to all around us; to &s;eek their happine&s;s, and lighten the weight of human mi&s;ery, to the utmo&s;t of our power.</P>
<P>There are, al&s;o, various accidental relations among&s;t mankind, as ma&s;ter, &s;ervant, father, governor, and numerous others; all which have their corre&s;pondent duties.</P>
<P>The relation we &s;tand in to the great Author of our being is that of children, which is one and immutable at all times. A life, agreeable to that relation we &s;tand in to the Lord Almighty, is that of filial fear. Obedience and wor&s;hip are our indi&s;pen&s;able duty to him; and the rules of ju&s;tice, charity, and brotherly kindne&s;s, are in|di&s;pen&s;able obligations on us to the re&s;t of man|kind.</P>
<P>Thus far, perhaps, the per&s;ons, whom I im|mediately addre&s;s at this time, may concur with me in &s;entiment: but they, as well as my&s;elf, are perhaps con&s;cious of having failed in nume|rous in&s;tances of di&s;charging their religious duties to God, and their &s;ocial duties one to another.</P>
<P><HI>We have all &s;inned, and fallen &s;hort of the glory of God.</HI> We have multiplied our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="26" REF="027217_0024_0FD3E2694A761DA8">
without number, and our manifold iniquities rife before us as a thick cloud, ob&s;curing the bright|ne&s;s of that Sun of eternal Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which would otherwi&s;e illuminate our under&s;tandings with its marvellous lights. <HI>Who therefore</HI> (&s;ays the humiliated, penitent &s;oul) <HI>&s;hall deliver us from the body of this death?</HI> Who &s;hall take from us the weight of our &s;ins, under which we groan ince&s;&s;antly? <HI>Who &s;hall deliver us from the wrath to come? Men and brethren, what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>The conditions of our redemption, and recon|ciliation with the gracious Father of us all, are clearly expre&s;&s;ed in the oracles of &s;acred truth. The placability of the divine nature is repeatedly a&s;&s;erted. He, with whom dwells wi&s;dom, ju&s;|tice, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;trength, is al&s;o repre|&s;ented to us in the glorious, adorable character of a God of mercy, long-&s;uffering, and never-failing kindne&s;s; as a Being ready to blot out our tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions from the cele&s;tial regi&s;ter, on our &s;incere repentance, and to remember them no more. He will re&s;tore unto the humble penitent the joy of his &s;alvation: he will guide him by his coun|&s;el, and afterwards receive him into glory.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="027217_0025_0FD3E26D456F1D00">This important and intere&s;ting doctrine was typified under the law, &s;poken of by the pro|phets, and gloriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted by the Son of God, who is our mediator with the Father, and the hope of all the righteous generations. In his character was di&s;played to mankind, in the mo&s;t eminent and &s;triking manner, the provident care, mercy, and goodne&s;s, of God towards his whole rational creation. Like &s;heep they have gone a&s;tray from the univer&s;al Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of &s;ouls. They have revolted from his govern|ment, and widely wandered from the path of purity and holine&s;s, which is al&s;o the path of plea&s;antne&s;s and peace; that path of moral rec|titude and truth, that bright and &s;hining light, which (like the luminous orb after it ari&s;es in our hemi&s;phere) &s;hines with increa&s;ing refulgence and &s;plendor till it arrive at the meridian altitude of glorious, perfect day. The light, which &s;hines from heaven on the under&s;tandings of men, will lead all tho&s;e, who pur&s;ue its direction, by degrees of experience, through the wilderne&s;s of this world in perfect &s;afety: it will bring them, when the days of their warfare are accompli&s;hed, to the grand end of their creation&mdash;to that com|plete

<P>The important me&s;&s;age which Chri&s;t, the glo|rious high-prie&s;t of the Chri&s;tian religion, had in commi&s;&s;ion from his and our Father, from his and our God, was, that he compa&s;&s;ionated his creatures, encompa&s;&s;ed with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es that their &s;ins had brought upon them&mdash;that he wil|led not their everla&s;ting &s;eparation from him, the &s;ource of happine&s;s, but that he was willing they &s;hould be reconciled to him. For this end, he called upon them to <HI>repent and be converted,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="027217_0027_0FD3E27327890478">

<P>This was the intere&s;ting doctrine which the Saviour of the world promulgated: and happy are tho&s;e who hear and obey it!</P>
<P><HI>Repent, and be converted, that your &s;ins may be forgiven you.</HI> It is not the a&s;&s;ent of the lip, and of the tongue, to the glorious truths of the go&s;|pel; it is not the &s;plendid formality of high pro|fe&s;&s;ion; it is not crying Lord, Lord! in the hour of &s;trong conviction; but it is a &s;urrender of the will and affections, a renovation of the heart, and conformity to the divine image, which can alone gain us an admittance into the New Jeru&s;alem, the city of God.</P>
<P>If we make an impartial &s;urvey of our pa&s;t lives, review our frequent revoltings, and com|pare our conduct with the convictions we have received of right and wrong, virtue and vice, there is &s;carcely a &s;oul pre&s;ent but mu&s;t feel &s;ome degree of remor&s;e, &s;ome degree of repentance, for the turpitude of his morals, and his want of love, obedience, and gratitude, to &s;o gracious a Father, who has encompa&s;&s;ed us with ble&s;&s;ings, and pre&s;erved us, by his providence, from the

On the&s;e &s;olemn reflections we mu&s;t (I &s;ay again) witne&s;s &s;ome degree of repentance; but, unhap|pily for us, the impre&s;&s;ions that are made on our minds, on a &s;erious review of our actions, are &s;oon cancelled, &s;oon effaced, by the influence which a variety of creaturely objects are &s;uffered to make upon us, and, like the early dew, they &s;oon pa&s;s away: <HI>Of the rock that begat them they have been unmindful.</HI> Clean&s;ed, in &s;ome degree, as we are, by the waters of contrition, we again become defiled by a repetition of that iniquity, which, in the moments of our humiliation, we had determined to renounce and for&s;ake.

What is to be done in the fatal dilemma to which our incon|&s;tancy to our virtuous re&s;olutions has reduced us?

They have a&s;ked coun&s;el of the won|derful Coun&s;ellor, and addre&s;&s;ed him with the important que&s;tion, <HI>What good thing &s;hall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</HI> yet, when the un|changeable terms of &s;alvation have been pro|po&s;ed; when they have been told they mu&s;t part with all their idols, they have gone away &s;orrow|ful: the terms have appeared too hard for them to comply with; and, like the king who wanted to be cured of his lepro&s;y, and was &s;taggered at the thought of taking &s;o long a journey as the prophet had directed, are crying out, <HI>Are not Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?</HI> will not their wa|ters clean&s;e me from my impurity?</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THEN Jesus said to his disciples, a rich man &s;hall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven; and again I say unto you, it is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, who then can be saved?</HI> It is no wonder, indeed, that the&s;e appeared to them to be <HI>hard sayings,</HI> and that they &s;hould excite their a&s;toni&s;hment, if they apprehended by them, that the kingdom of hea|ven was only open to poverty and wretchedne&s;s. It appears, I think, beyond controver&s;y, that not|with&s;tanding the di&s;ciples attended to the doctrine of &s;uch an excellent mini&s;ter, who &s;poke with peculiar authority, yet they did not at once com|prehend
<PB N="50" REF="027217_0048_0FD3E298274FD3D8">
the whole of his doctrine and works. Their under&s;tandings were gradually opened and informed: they were led on &s;tep by &s;tep. The work of religion was not with them, as &s;ome people have imagined the work of religion to be, an in|&s;tantaneous work: they went on from &s;trength to &s;trength, and from one degree of knowledge to another, till they had acquired as much as was nece&s;&s;ary for them. They were not in&s;tructed in all truths, but in &s;uch as re&s;pected the duties of their day and of their &s;tation, and which, in the cour&s;e of their pilgrimage in this world, filled them with a humble hope and expectation of ul|timately entering into one that is infinitely bet|ter, there to partake of the joy of their Lord, and of that re&s;t from their labours which is prepared for the people of God. Thus, we find, when they were told that <HI>they mu&s;t eat his fle&s;h, and drink his blood,</HI>&mdash;that it was nece&s;&s;ary a man &s;hould <HI>hate his father and mother, his wife, his children, and even his own life,</HI>&mdash;accepting the&s;e texts, at fir&s;t, in a &s;trict and literal &s;en&s;e, it is no wonder they &s;hould think them <HI>hard sayings:</HI> hard indeed it would be if it were nece&s;&s;ary that the affections, which flow from con&s;anguinity and affinity, mu&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="027217_0049_0FD3CBE063960FC8">
be totally eradicated, and the malignant pa&s;&s;ion of hatred be &s;ub&s;tituted, in order to render us &s;ucce&s;sful candidates for an inheritance that is incorruptible and that fadeth not away.</P>
<P>But it is clear to me, beyond the lea&s;t doubt, that our Lord de&s;igned, throughout the whole of his mini&s;try, to excite and to &s;trengthen, in|&s;tead of weakening, tho&s;e bands by which &s;ociety is held together.</P>
<P>He de&s;igned to in&s;pire us with the mo&s;t friend|ly affections, as the main, or principal, motive to the di&s;charge of the various &s;ocial and relative duties: this appears to me to be comprehended in the &s;econd commandment, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thyself.</HI> With re&s;pect to this parti|cular pa&s;&s;age of the New Te&s;tament, it may, perhaps, be profitable, at lea&s;t to the younger part of this a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e experience has not yet been much, and who&s;e ob&s;ervations have been but tran&s;ient, to advert a little to the occa&s;ion of the&s;e <HI>hard sayings,</HI> which excited the amazement of the di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>It &s;eems there was a young man who had heard of the fame of Je&s;us; who wanted to be in&s;tructed with re&s;pect to what mea&s;ures were
<PB N="52" REF="027217_0050_0FD3E299549A6DE8">
nece&s;&s;ary for him to adopt and to pur&s;ue in order to inherit everla&s;ting life. Urged by this de&s;ire, he makes an application unto Je&s;us, addre&s;&s;ing him after this manner, <HI>Good ma&s;ter, what good thing &s;hall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?</HI> Our Saviour enumerated &s;everal of the com|mandments, to which he replied, and no doubt with the greate&s;t degree of &s;incerity, <HI>All these have I kept from my youth up, what lack I yet?</HI> It ap|pears that our Lord meant to bring his love and his virtue to a &s;evere te&s;t. <HI>One thing,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>thou lacke&s;t; if thou wilt be perfect, sell that thou ha&s;t, and give to the poor; take up thy cross, and fol|low me, and thou &s;halt have treasure in heaven.</HI> It &s;eems that our Saviour &s;truck at his darling pa&s;|&s;ion, the love of money; for, upon hearing this propo&s;al, it is evident that he preferred, at that time, retaining his corporeal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that pre|&s;ent temporary good, to the future and remote one of eternal life for, <HI>he went away sorrowful.</HI></P>
<P>Then Je&s;us &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, <HI>A rich man &s;hall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI> It mu&s;t, indeed, be acknowledged, that, &s;eeing we have nothing which we have not received,&mdash;that we are not proprietors of the inheritance which
<PB N="53" REF="027217_0051_0FD3E29B8FAA9AD8">
we po&s;&s;e&s;s, but tenants only at will; for, <HI>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, and the cattle on a thousand hills,</HI>&mdash;we ought to relinqui&s;h, to give up, a part, or the whole, of that which is lent us, when it is the will of the giver to make that requi&s;ition: but it is evident to me, that this particular requi&s;ition intends not a general command. I conceive, that it is not riches, merely as riches, which can prevent our entrance into the kingdom of heaven. It may be &s;aid, with equal truth, that, <HI>it is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a poor man to enter into the kingdom of heaven,</HI> if he have nothing but poverty and wretchedne&s;s to recommend him. It is very evident, from divers circum&s;tances, that our Lord's controver&s;y was not with riches, but the &s;pirit of pride, which too frequently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the hearts of the rich; for, we have an account of a rich, and yet of a good, man, Jo&s;eph of Arima|thea. From the &s;everal accounts of the evange|li&s;ts it appears he was an honourable coun&s;ellor, a rich man, a good, a ju&s;t, man, a di&s;ciple of Je|&s;us, and one that <HI>waited for the kingdom of God,</HI> though it was probable that he was a member of the Sanhedrim.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="027217_0052_0FD3E29E2C25FC98">It &s;eems to me that the rich man, de&s;igned in this text, is &s;uch a man as is repre&s;ented to us in the parable: <HI>There was a certain rich man, who was clothed with purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuou&s;ly every day: there was also a certain beg|gar, that was laid at his gate, full of sores,</HI> of whom there can be no doubt that he was a proper ob|ject of human &s;ympathy. He was laid at his gate full of &s;ores: his requi&s;ition was humble, de|&s;iring to be fed only with <HI>the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table; moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores. It came to pass that the beggar died, and that he was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; and he lifted up his eyes in hell, and saw Lazarus in Abraham's bosom. He cried out in a sort of agony, Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus that he may dip his finger in water to cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame: but Abraham answered, Son, remember, that thou, in thy lifetime, received&s;t thy good things, and like|wise Lazarus evil things; but now, he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</HI> But we are not to infer from this text, that, merely his being clothed in purple and fine linen, or faring &s;umptuou&s;ly, was
<PB N="55" REF="027217_0053_0FD3E29F6496DDF8">
the cau&s;e of his con&s;equent mi&s;ery; or, that it followed of cour&s;e, having received the good things of this life, he &s;hould &s;uffer the wor&s;t of evils in the next; but it appears he wanted that brotherly &s;ympathy, that friendly affection, re|commended to us in the character of the good Samaritan, which is not re&s;tricted to any peculiar cla&s;s, but directed to every object of di&s;tre&s;s. There was a man, who, travelling from Jeru&s;a|lem to Jericho, fell among thieves: he was &s;poiled, he was wounded.&mdash;The prie&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by,&mdash;he who attended at the altar of God, he that &s;hould have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;pirit of univer&s;al charity. The prie&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by,&mdash;the Levite fol|lowed his example, untouched with the feelings of humanity; his heart was contracted, perhaps, by the prejudices of a party, which he had con|ceived to be religion. But a Samaritan pa&s;&s;ed that way: he looked upon the man with that &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion which the love of Chri&s;t in&s;pires towards a brother in di&s;tre&s;s, in|capable of relieving him&s;elf, upon whom many &s;ufferings were brought, and many more expected to follow. He takes compa&s;&s;ion of this poor Jew, pours oil and wine into his wounds, at|tempts
<PB N="56" REF="027217_0054_0FD3E2A648592D30">
to alleviate his grief by le&s;&s;ening its cau&s;e; and, though he could have no expectation of compen&s;ation, yet it did not re&s;train him from attempting every thing in his power for the re|lief of this indigent per&s;on, and his views were not confined to the pre&s;ent time; he looked for|ward, and endeavoured to provide for his future well-being, giving a direction unto hit ho&s;t, <HI>I will repay thee.</HI> It was therefore the want of this &s;ympathy, together with the &s;pirit of pride, which prompted the rich man to pur&s;ue the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, of the eye, and the pride of life, at the expence of his &s;ocial and religious duties, which rendered him highly criminal. This ap|pears clearly to have been de&s;igned: the charac|ter of this <HI>certain rich man</HI> and that of the beggar formed a contra&s;t. The rich man wanted vir|tue; the poor man was de&s;titute of food; it is evident, however, that he was in a humble &s;tate. What could he have a&s;ked le&s;s if he had a&s;ked any thing? The &s;everity of hunger forced him to a&s;k thus much of him, as he was incapable of helping him&s;elf. He de&s;ired only the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, but he was unnoticed. If he had been of the rich, if there
<PB N="57" REF="027217_0055_0FD3E2A64C2E1E48">
had been a pro&s;pect that the intere&s;t, or the plea|&s;ure, of the rich man could have been aug|mented by relieving him, he would have noticed him as Laban did Abraham's &s;ervant when he &s;aw the bracelets on his &s;i&s;ter's hands, <HI>Come in, thou ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord, wherefore &s;tande&s;t thou without?</HI> The door would have been readily opened to opulence, and titular dignity would have found an ea&s;y acce&s;s; but the poor beg|gar lay unnoticed: the inferior &s;pecies of ani|mals &s;eemed to feel more &s;ympathy than the rich man, <HI>Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</HI> I would not be under&s;tood, by any thing that I have &s;aid, to attempt an ingenious apo|logy for the rich; but, at the &s;ame time, I would attempt to make that di&s;tinction between the poverty of the heart and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the hands which the author of the Chri&s;tian religion de&s;igned. In the cour&s;e of the provi|dence of Almighty God it &s;o falleth out, that the efforts of the laborious and indu&s;trious are not crowned with equal &s;ucce&s;s. But we are not to conclude that the per&s;on, who&s;e barns are filled with plenty, and who&s;e pre&s;&s;es are ready to bur&s;t <HI>with new wine,</HI> is the di&s;tingui&s;hed favourite

of heaven, any more than that the poor man, who divides his mor&s;el with his family, and mixes his tears with his bread, is reprobated by heaven. It is the abu&s;e, and not the u&s;e, of riches which the te&s;timony of Chri&s;t is certainly again&s;t. The apo&s;tle did not enjoin the rich to throw away their riches, but he exhorts Timothy to <HI>charge them who are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded,</HI> that they a&s;&s;ume nothing on the &s;core of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: <HI>Charge the rich of this world that they be not high-minded, neither tru&s;t in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giv|eth us all things richly to enjoy.</HI> This is what he had in charge, adding, I think, that <HI>we brought nothing with us into the world, and we &s;hall carry nothing out of it. Naked we came into the world, naked we &s;hall return,</HI> be di&s;&s;olved and mixed with tho&s;e elements, from which we originally &s;prang. I would, therefore, attempt, at lea&s;t, that we &s;hould individually reflect upon the circum&s;tan|ces that we are placed in, and that we &s;hould re|ceive with gratitude the portion which, in the general cour&s;e of God's providence, &s;hall be allot|ted to us. Nothing more is required of us than to be <HI>good &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God.</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="027217_0057_0FD3E2A9215F4DF0">
We are called &s;tewards; and a time approaches, with unavoidable certainty, when the Lord of the univer&s;e will call us, will &s;ummon us hence, with <HI>Give thou an account of thy &s;teward&s;hip, for thou &s;halt be no longer &s;teward.</HI> Let us therefore con&s;ider the &s;everal talents we have received for the improvement of our hearts in the Chri&s;|tian life: let us con&s;ider the outward benefits that are be&s;towed upon us, and let it be the &s;tudy of our lives to apply them properly, and to re|&s;emble the good Samaritan; that in imitating the example of the author of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, it may be the delight of our lives to diffu&s;e happine&s;s all around, and to <HI>go about doing good.</HI> This appears to be of indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation.

this &s;cene of things without any hope or expecta|tion of entering upon any &s;cene that is better. He looks back upon a life that has been &s;pent in various &s;pecies of di&s;&s;ipation, in the gratification of his &s;en&s;ual appetites, and in the neglect of every &s;ocial duty. He now finds him&s;elf in a cir|cum&s;tance far beneath the poor beggar's that lay at his gate.&mdash;Con&s;cience re&s;umes the &s;eat &s;he had lo&s;t,&mdash;wounds that had been healed break out afre&s;h, and bleed angui&s;h.

He looks forward, but he has no hope; his <HI>&s;inging men</HI> and his <HI>&s;inging women,</HI> with the voice of the pipe and the tabret, can no more in&s;pire his &s;oul with joy. He is about to quit this mortal &s;tage, and to enter into the world of &s;pirits, but de&s;titute of tho&s;e moral virtues that would have qualified him to join the cele&s;tial &s;ociety, and to take a part in the general fe&s;tivity which prevails throughout heaven's em|pire. The rich man lifted up his eyes to heaven in a &s;tate of angui&s;h; he beheld the beggar in Abraham's bo&s;om. We are not to con&s;ider this text literally: this is a parable, not a matter of fact; and a parable de&s;igned to illu&s;trate the

moral doctrine of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. He reaped the fruit of his doings, that which will inevitably follow a cour&s;e of di&s;&s;ipation and a neglect of our proper duties: <HI>The recompence of his hands</HI> will be rendered to every man. <HI>To those, who obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, in|dignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h, upon every soul of man that doeth evil: of the Jew fir&s;t, and also of the Gentile; for, there is no respect of persons with God:</HI> and I wi&s;h to God there were le&s;s re&s;pect of per&s;ons with men.

De&s;pi&s;ed of his brethren, unpitied, unrelieved, he lay at the gates of the rich man; the dogs licked his wounds:&mdash;he importuned charity,&mdash;but he im|portuned in vain. The rich man's ear was deaf to his prayers. What con&s;olation could he have in this &s;tate! Indeed, his feelings mu&s;t have been exqui&s;ite. Hunger and thir&s;t are appetites, which, in the extreme, throw the mind into tu|mult. His natural feelings were painful, but what were his pro&s;pects! What were his hopes! Though he was poor, he was not for&s;aken of his

Maker: he could not boa&s;t of <HI>purple and fine linen,</HI> he attended not the tables of the rich, nor partook of their luxurious banquets, yet he was the offspring of the eternal Father, who made of <HI>one blood all the nations of men who dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the bounds of their habitation.</HI> If the earth was unpropitious to his prayers, &s;till heaven was open to his cries. The Sovereign of the univer&s;e, who regards the <HI>crying of the poor and the supplication of the needy,</HI> took compa&s;&s;ion on the poor beggar. He was about to quit his rags, to quit his poverty, and to enter into a &s;tate of everla&s;ting happine&s;s,&mdash;he was <HI>carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom.</HI> Which of tho&s;e circum&s;tances was the mo&s;t de|&s;irable?

right, and yet pur&s;ue the wrong: we do the thing that we would not, and neglect that which we would, do. The pa&s;&s;ions of human nature are exceedingly &s;trong, and there is &s;ome one that generally characteri&s;es every per&s;on; a kind of reigning pa&s;&s;ion, which, like Aaron's rod, &s;wal|lows up all the re&s;t.

The gratification of the pre&s;ent moment engages our pa&s;&s;ions. If we were to form an idea by the general practice of mankind, we &s;eem to forget that we are mortal, and that we mu&s;t die.

I wi&s;h, therefore, that we might be induced to reflect on the vanity of human wi&s;hes, and on the folly of human pur&s;uits. We have no con|tinuing city here: perfect felicity is no more to be found in this mutable &s;tate of things, than it was practicable for the Babel-builders to erect an edifice that &s;hould reach the heavens. Many have &s;oared aloft, and built their ne&s;ts on high, as upon the cedar of Lebanon, yet they have been brought down. Death levels all di&s;tinctions, and earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions make no difference in the grave: let us &s;et our affections therefore upon things that are above, and not on things which are beneath. If our affections be placed upon the &s;uperior good, we &s;hall feel gradually a le&s;s at|tachment to things that are &s;een;&mdash;le&s;s to this world, the fa&s;hion whereof is pa&s;&s;ing away, and we are pa&s;&s;ing away with it.

<P>The de&s;ign of the author of this p&s;alm was, to excite, both in him&s;elf and in the minds of others, the mo&s;t fervent emotions of gratitude, thank&s;giving, and prai&s;e.

We carefully watch for an opportunity to expre&s;s our gratitude, not only in being verbally thank|ful, but are al&s;o &s;tudious to avoid every thing that would furni&s;h occa&s;ion of offence to our benefactor; and, on the other hand, are equally &s;tudious to render our&s;elves, as much as po&s;&s;ible, worthy objects of his favourable regard. Thus it is in &s;ocial life among men, and &s;imilar there|to it is with tho&s;e minds which are impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of gratitude to the &s;upreme Being.

<P>This is the language of the devoted heart; and, though it might be uttered only mentally, or not be expre&s;&s;ed by any vocal &s;ound, yet the Searcher of hearts would accept that affection, or devotion of mind.

But of tho&s;e, who are de&s;titute of this mo&s;t worthy principle of gratitude, other joys allure the affections, other motives than religious and &s;ocial duties.

<P>Thus the children of I&s;rael, in proportion as they lo&s;t &s;ight of the providence of the Almighty, and of what he had done for them, became more and more depraved; in&s;omuch, that they joined &s;ome of the &s;urrounding nations in the perform|ance of idolatrous acts.

<P>There is no &s;ource of temporal plea&s;ure but what may &s;oon terminate. Di&s;appointment awaits us in every &s;tate.

How many in&s;tances have we &s;een of people, in|toxicated with a &s;pirit of ambition and avarice, who &s;uppo&s;ed that the accumulation of wealth would render them perfectly happy; who have propo&s;ed to them&s;elves a future period, when they &s;hould &s;it down at the end of their labours in peace; and have gone on, from one &s;tage of life to another, led as it were by an <HI>ignis-fatuus,</HI> to perambulate the enchanted circle! Di&s;ap|pointment
<PB N="87" REF="027217_0085_0FD3E2DAC6829C58">
has terminated their pur&s;uits. If we have not &s;omething el&s;e to re&s;t our hopes upon than the plea&s;ure which this world can produce, we &s;hall be like the man who dreamt that he was hungry, and ate; thir&s;ty, and he drank; but awoke, and beheld his appetites &s;till remained: and this may perhaps con&s;titute, in part, the mi&s;ery of a future &s;tate,&mdash;the entering into it with appetites which cannot be gratified.</P>
<P>Having attempted to &s;hew the importance of gratitude, and the di&s;mal con&s;equences that flow from the contrary principle, I will now attempt, at lea&s;t, to point out one cau&s;e why we feel &s;o little of this virtuous affection;&mdash;that is, Ambi|tion, the grand enemy of man's felicity. On the wings of imagination, in an extravagant antici|pation of the future, man deprives him&s;elf of the enjoyment which virtue would yield him in the pre&s;ent hour. <HI>He labours for very vanity, and disquiets himself in vain.</HI> Perhaps we &s;hall find the very &s;eeds of ambition &s;own, as it were, and interwoven, with our very nature and con&s;titu|tion. There is &s;ome &s;pecies of ambition that takes place in the lowe&s;t as well as in the highe&s;t ranks of &s;ociety. In our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances,
<PB N="88" REF="027217_0086_0FD3E2E0097F7CF0">
let them be what they may above wanting the nece&s;&s;aries of life, (which is the lot of but very few, comparatively &s;peaking; and, of this few, the evil hast been brought upon them principally by their own imprudence and intemperance) we &s;hould be content. A few, indeed, have been &s;ubjected to want the nece&s;&s;aries of life by una|voidable events: the&s;e are worthy objects of charity, and will not be neglected by tho&s;e who can feel for another's woe. But, indeed, &s;uch is the want of &s;ympathy, that &s;ome people &s;eldom &s;ee an affliction without their own doors. They live for them&s;elves only, and &s;eem as if they were as de&s;titute of the love of their neighbour as they are of gratitude to God. But, with re&s;|pect to this pa&s;&s;ion of ambition, again&s;t which I would in a peculiar manner endeavour to guard the minds of youth, re&s;i&s;t it early, or it will grow with your growth, and &s;trengthen with your &s;trength. Guard again&s;t the errors of libertini&s;m, the errors of the &s;pendthrift, and the errors of the mi&s;er, that you may early po&s;&s;e&s;s the emo|tions of gratitude to the Author of your being. If it be your lot to abound in this world's goods, receive the &s;uperabundant favours with gratitude,
<PB N="89" REF="027217_0087_0FD3E2E15585C400">
and thankfully apply them to the purpo&s;es for which they were given. But, &s;uch is the na|ture of this pa&s;&s;ion (ambition) that it prompts us to look up to the cla&s;&s;es of mankind a little above us, and not to the Mo&s;t High. We look among our neighbours, who have acquired a lit|tle more than we have acquired, and are led as it were imperceptibly towards a &s;tate we can ne|ver attain. I have never known, in the cour&s;e of my ob&s;ervation, a per&s;on, who was not con|tented in a low &s;tate of life, that was ever happier in a higher; but I have known &s;ome who have been happy in a low &s;tation, and, when they have eaten their mor&s;el in quietne&s;s, have offered unto God thank&s;giving and prai&s;e. Happine&s;s is tendered to all. Be but grateful, and thou &s;halt be happy; for, gratitude will in&s;pire us with this &s;entiment, <HI>Having food and raiment, be there|with content.</HI></P>
<P>I make the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject with|out premeditation; and, indeed, the want of or|der in my delivery of them will be a &s;ufficient proof of it. I recommend them to your &s;erious con&s;ideration, and wi&s;h your hearts may be &s;uit|ably impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ubject. And, though
<PB N="90" REF="027217_0088_0FD3E2E347DB1FA8">
thank&s;giving &s;hould be our general mental habit, our hearts &s;hould be particularly impre&s;&s;ed with it at particular times. We ought to look up with peculiar thank&s;giving to the throne of grace in the moment of fruition. We have en|joined no peculiar mode, or form, of prayer or thank&s;giving. We have no ceremony by way of grace before and after meat; but, in di&s;pen&s;|ing with the&s;e forms, we do not di&s;pen&s;e with the thing it&s;elf intended by them. We ought to be impre&s;&s;ed with filial piety towards our Almighty Father. We ought to make a &s;olemn pau&s;e pre|vious to our partaking of the divine bounty, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a &s;pirit of devotion, that we may <HI>offer,</HI> at lea&s;t mentally, <HI>unto God thanksgiving and praise.</HI></P>
<P>And, at the clo&s;e of the day, though we have no form of evening or morning prayer, yet I would attempt to impre&s;s the minds of youth e&s;pecially, that, before they clo&s;e their eyes to &s;leep, they &s;hould review the tran&s;actions of the pa&s;t day, and &s;ee what there is to approve, what to condemn,&mdash;to contemplate the mercy and the goodne&s;s extended to them, that they may <HI>offer unto God thanksgiving</HI> for his mercies, and
<PB N="91" REF="027217_0089_0FD3E2E54D5237A0">
commend them&s;elves to his protection. Again, in the morning, we ought al&s;o to offer up thank&s;|giving. If we po&s;&s;e&s;s this di&s;po&s;ition of mind, we &s;hall not be entangled with the things of this life, which en&s;nare, but &s;hall con&s;ider our&s;elves as &s;trangers and pilgrims on earth, anticipating a better country, a better inheritance, where, with &s;aints and angels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, in a humble contemplation of the divine attributes, and of the di&s;pen&s;ations of his provi|dence, and favoured with the renewed impre&s;&s;ion of his goodne&s;s, we may, with purified &s;pirits, approach him in the multitude of his mercies, and <HI>offer unto him thanksgiving and praise!</HI></P>

<P>But, though I am led to &s;peak after this man|ner, I have no doubt that there are many in this audience who have weighed the worth of vanity, and e&s;timated the in&s;ignificancy of all terre&s;trial things; who have &s;een that they are not adapted to &s;atiate the thir&s;t of an immortal &s;pirit.

<P>THERE is a pa&s;&s;age of holy writ which hath engaged my &s;erious meditation. You will find it, on &s;acred record, in words to this purport:</P>

who looketh not as man looketh, but looketh at the heart.</P>
<P>I conceive, however, that this pa&s;&s;age is not to be admitted without &s;ome exception; for, it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome people may have digre&s;&s;ed &s;o widely from the paths of truth and virtue, and &s;unk &s;o deeply into the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of &s;en&s;ual|ity, as to have their under&s;tandings clouded, and perceive not the propriety and the excellency of virtue. Their con&s;ciences are become <HI>seared as with a hot iron.</HI> Reiterated tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the divine law renders the heart, as it were, in &s;ome degree, callous, and it lo&s;es that delicate moral &s;en&s;ibility di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of con&s;cience. On the other hand, &s;ome pious, well-di&s;po&s;ed people, afflicted perhaps by &s;ome &s;pecies of natural di&s;ea&s;e, have let in, and che|ri&s;hed, groundle&s;s fears and apprehen&s;ions, have thought them&s;elves &s;o morally depraved and pol|luted, that, though &s;ome of them &s;eem to be the be&s;t of mankind, we may have ob&s;erved them to have been brought to the confines of the horri|ble pit of de&s;pair.

<P><HI>WITHOUT Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to please God; for, he that cometh unto God mu&s;t be|lieve that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</HI></P>
<P>The revival of this pa&s;&s;age of holy writ, in my remembrance, hath been the means of ex|citing and fixing my attention upon the &s;ubject of faith.</P>
<P>It cannot, I conceive, have e&s;caped the ob&s;er|vation of any per&s;on, who is arrived at years of under&s;tanding, and is conver&s;ant with the Holy Scriptures, that the &s;ame word <HI>faith</HI> hath divers acceptations: that, in &s;ome places, it intends not only a belief in the exi&s;tence of an infinitely

wi&s;e, powerful, and intelligent, Being, who is a rewarder of them who diligently &s;eek him; but al&s;o an affiance, or tru&s;t, in &s;ea&s;ons of adver&s;ity and probation, in that Being who has all power in heaven and earth, who&s;e power is uncon|troulable, who doeth what&s;oever plea&s;eth him in the armies of Heaven and among&s;t the inhabit|ants of the earth.&mdash;The word <HI>faith</HI> is al&s;o u&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h between the different di&s;pen&s;a|tions; to point out the glorious di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which is called the <HI>law of faith,</HI> and to contradi&s;tingui&s;h it from the Mo|&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, which is called the <HI>law of works;</HI> and I conceive, that, wherever any of the writers of the New Te&s;tament &s;peak of the in&s;ignifican|cy of works, with re&s;pect to the rendering a man acceptable to the Author of his being, the works of the law, or, to u&s;e the apo&s;tle's expre&s;&s;ion, the deeds of the law, by which no fle&s;h living can be ju&s;tified, are intended. The rituals of the legal di&s;pen&s;ation are not of a nature to be tru&s;ted in. Our Saviour, in his per&s;on, fulfilled the obliga|tion of that law, and was the end of that law for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake. It is therefore written, that he has taken away the hand-writing of ordinan|ces,
<PB N="126" REF="027217_0124_0FD3E323A585D1D8">
and nailed them to his cro&s;s; which mu&s;t re&s;|pect the rituals of the Mu&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Some people, whom I need not uncharitably cen&s;ure, have, I conceive, entertained a mi&s;taken notion re&s;pecting the nature of that faith which is effectual, through Chri&s;t, to the &s;alvation of the &s;oul. They have apprehended, that a belief in the exi&s;tence of the Supreme Being, and a be|lief in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom God has &s;ent, is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient, and, unto whom&s;oever this faith is given, they are to be deemed of the number of the cho&s;en few, whom God prede&s;tinated from everla&s;ting unto eternal life; and that this faith, apart from the con&s;ideration of works, is &s;uffi|cient unto &s;alvation:&mdash;but to me it appears, on the mo&s;t &s;erious inve&s;tigation of the Holy Scriptures, that, as without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God, &s;o with faith it is po&s;&s;ible to di&s;|plea&s;e him. This is a propo&s;ition which I con|ceive might be proved from divers parts of the New Te&s;tament e&s;pecially; more particularly where we are told of people, who, after they knew God (it implies that he was manife&s;ted un|to them) after they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but became vain in their imagi|nations,
<PB N="127" REF="027217_0125_0FD3E324F21891D8">
and their fooli&s;h hearts became darken|ed. They glorified him not as God, that is, they brought not forth tho&s;e good fruits, by which, it is &s;aid, that our Father who is in Heaven is glorified; for, herein, &s;ays our Lord, is my heavenly Father glorified, in that ye bring forth much fruit; by which, undoubtedly, the fruits of the Spirit are intended, joy, peace, love, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, and faith. It is po&s;&s;ible that a man may be convinced with re&s;pect to the truth of certain propo&s;itions re|ceived upon the authority, the divine authority, of him who propo&s;es them, and yet may act in direct contradiction to the obligation of tho&s;e laws. Now we are in divers places in&s;tructed re&s;pecting the e&s;&s;entiality of faith; that it is a lively, operating principle of the judgment, which hath a moral influence upon a man's actions: not a mere barren, &s;peculative faith, but a faith that worketh by love&mdash;To what? To the purify|ing of the con&s;cience from all dead works, to &s;erve the living God, not in the oldne&s;s of the letter, but in the newne&s;s of the Spirit, and with life; and, le&s;t the primitive Chri&s;tians &s;hould entertain a mi&s;taken notion of the effica|cy
<PB N="128" REF="027217_0126_0FD3E3265D943848">
of faith in the ab&s;tract, and &s;hould re&s;t their hopes of &s;alvation upon their &s;ub&s;cription to cer|tain articles of faith, though tho&s;e articles be founded upon the ba&s;is of immutable truth, the apo&s;tle takes occa&s;ion to in&s;truct them that faith without works is dead: Thinke&s;t thou, O vain man, that faith can &s;ave thee? The very devils (&s;ays he) believe; the very devils believe, and they al&s;o tremble; for, as the body without the &s;oul is dead, &s;o faith without works is dead al&s;o; and he propo&s;ed a te&s;t, a te&s;t of &s;aving faith, which is ea&s;y and obvious, and ought to be more con&s;ulted than it is by the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es and &s;ocieties of religious profe&s;&s;ors: Shew me (&s;ays he) thy faith without thy works, and I will &s;hew thee my faith by my works, for, the tree is to be denominated by its fruit: <HI>by their fruit you &s;hall know them.</HI> The true believer is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the practical infidel by his fruits; he brings forth fruits meet for repentance; he adds, to his faith, virtue; to virtue, knowledge; to knowledge, temperance; to temperance, broth|erly kindne&s;s; and to brotherly kindne&s;s, chari|ty; and, if the&s;e things (&s;ays the apo&s;tle) be in you, and abound, they &s;hall make you that ye

&s;hall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the &s;aving knowledge of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Shew me thy faith without thy works;</HI> a man may have the cleare&s;t conception of truth without reducing this theory into practice in his own per&s;on. To apprehend the right is one thing; to conform our&s;elves to the rule of right, in our lives and in our manners, is another thing; therefore it &s;eems, to me, beyond the lea&s;t de|gree of doubt, that &s;omething more than a &s;pec|ulative belief, or a faith in certain propo&s;itions, is nece&s;&s;ary to render us acceptable to the &s;u|preme Being, and to qualify us for an inherit|ance among the &s;aints in light, to be heirs of God, and co-heirs with Chri&s;t. And I wi&s;h, as it is a matter of infinite importance to us all, that we, agreeable to the advice of the apo&s;tle to the members of the primitive church, might ex|amine our&s;elves whether we are in the faith: <HI>Prove your own selves; know ye not yourselves how that Jesus Chri&s;t is in you unless ye be reprobates?</HI> Let us not content our&s;elves, that we are the de|&s;cendents of reputed Chri&s;tian parents, that we have been made acquainted with the contents of the &s;acred hi&s;tory of the old and of the new Te&s;|tament;
<PB N="130" REF="027217_0128_0FD3E32931F42D70">
let us not re&s;t &s;atisfied merely with a profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian religion in theory; but let us al&s;o be concerned to act con&s;i&s;tently with the nature and obligation of that holy reli|gion which Je&s;us Chri&s;t was &s;ent of the Father to promote among the &s;ons and daughters of men.</P>
<P>The obligations and the Chri&s;tian duties en|joined in the New Te&s;tament are adapted at once to better our condition in this world, to make us happier in our &s;hort pilgrimage through it, and al&s;o to &s;ecure to us everla&s;ting felicity in the world which is to come. Let us not forget that our Lord &s;ays, <HI>It is not every one that says, Lord, Lord, that &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but be that doeth the will of my Father, who is in heaven.</HI> And again our Lord in&s;tructs us thus; <HI>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the com|mandments.</HI></P>
<P>By good works, I mean a conformity of the will and of the powers of the mind to that law or rule of action, which is of God given unto man, to illuminate his paths in this world, and guide him by his coun&s;el to the participation of the realms of eternal glory; and as the power of
<PB N="131" REF="027217_0129_0FD3E32BEA8D5368">
obedience is derived from him, the Author of all that is excellent and good, as he is the giver of every good and perfect gift, &s;o that power is giv|en unto us, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by which we are capable of di&s;charging our &s;everal obliga|tions. I &s;ay, it being the gift of God, and not inherent in the creature, we a&s;cribe all unto him, who is the efficient cau&s;e of all holine&s;s and virtue in every part of his va&s;tly-extended empire; for, it is God that works in us to do according to his own good plea&s;ure, which plea|&s;ure is, that we &s;hould walk circum&s;pectly, not as fools, but as wi&s;e, redeeming the time, &s;eeing that the days are evil; that we (to u&s;e the lan|guage of the apo&s;tle) &s;hould be <HI>careful to main|tain good works,</HI> which <HI>are good and profitable unto men.</HI> I pretend not that they are profitable unto God, but they are profitable unto men; and godline&s;s (which implies the obligation of practi|cal duties, as well as &s;tedfa&s;tly believing) is pro|fitable for all things, having the promi&s;e of the life that now is, and al&s;o of that which is to come; but I may &s;ay, in the language of one formerly on this &s;ubject, with re&s;pect to the &s;u|preme Being, who is perfect, &s;elf-&s;ufficient, and
<PB N="132" REF="027217_0130_0FD3E33071F3CFB0">
can receive nothing from his creatures, to whom he has communicated every thing. <HI>If thou be righteous, what give&s;t thou him, or what receiveth he of thine hand? thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteousness may profit the children of men.</HI> It is for this purpo&s;e, this noble, this di&s;intere&s;ted purpo&s;e, that the Almighty has e&s;|tabli&s;hed a law to his creatures, not for his own profit, but for theirs. Hence it is &s;aid, that the &s;abbath was made for man, and not man for the &s;abbath.</P>
<P>In the wi&s;dom and &s;upreme goodne&s;s of the Creator, the obligation of Chri&s;tian duties, in all circum&s;tances, is adapted to the nature and ca|pacity of his creatures, to promote righteou&s;ne&s;s through all the ranks and cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety; and, were but our obedience proportionate to our knowledge, did we act con&s;i&s;tently with the dic|tates of our judgment, and the dictates of our faith, we might hope to &s;ee the revival of that &s;tate, <HI>when the morning stars sang together, and the sons of God &s;houted for joy.</HI></P>
<P>Examine your&s;elves, whether you are in the faith; for, we are abundantly in&s;tructed, as I have already ob&s;erved, that the faith that is &s;av|ing,
<PB N="133" REF="027217_0131_0FD3E331B5FD1738">
is productive of good works; and it is the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t te&s;t whereby to try whether a man has a &s;aving or only a &s;peculative faith, as the tree is to be known by his fruits; for men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thi&s;tles. Therefore that profe&s;&s;or of the Chri&s;tian religion, the tenor of who&s;e actions gives the lie to his profe&s;&s;ion; that profe&s;&s;or gives a manife&s;tation that he has only a traditional religion, a tradi|tional zeal, and a traditional faith, like the peo|ple of the Jews, who expre&s;&s;ed a veneration for the temple of the mo&s;t high God, and the rituals of the legal di&s;pen&s;ation, and cried, <HI>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the tem|ple of the Lord, are these.</HI> But the prophet &s;aid, <HI>Tru&s;t ye not in lying words, saying, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord; but amend your ways and your doings.</HI></P>
<P>Many and glorious are the privileges that are to be enjoyed by the believer, &s;uch a per&s;on as I have attempted to de&s;cribe, who not only believes in the infinitely &s;upreme and powerful Being; in the manife&s;tation of his Son; in the hi&s;tory of his life, of his death, of his re&s;urrection, of his a&s;cen&s;ion into glory, and in the principles
<PB N="134" REF="027217_0132_0FD3E3337954ECF8">
and doctrines which he propagated; but who manife&s;ts that he has a faith that worketh by love, the tendency of which is to purify the con&s;cience from dead works, to clean&s;e it from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, that the &s;oul of man may become the temple of the Holy Gho&s;t.&mdash; Great and glorious privileges are to be enjoyed by tho&s;e few, by tho&s;e of whatever religious &s;ociety, who are partakers of true &s;aving faith; for, it is worthy of being noted, that the Au|thor of the Chri&s;tian religion is of no party, but the friend of all; that his grace, like the rays of the &s;un, is extended to all, from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from the rivers unto the ends of the earth; in&s;omuch that we are told in the Scrip|tures, that the Go&s;pel is preached in every creature under heaven; that all have heard, though all have not obeyed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are true believers, are of that &s;tock and family unto whom it was &s;aid, <HI>Fear not, little flock; it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

<P>The writings both of the Old and the New Te&s;tament, abundantly te&s;tify, that God doth not only reveal him&s;elf unto his rational crea|tures in the volume of his works, or the book of nature, in which the attributes, particularly of power and of intelligence, are eminently di&s;|played, but that he al&s;o reveals him&s;elf unto his rational creatures immediately by his Spirit, which I conceive to be the grand and primary

<P><HI>There is a spirit in man</HI> (a rational capacity, by which he is eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed from the bea&s;ts of the field, and the fowls of heaven) <HI>and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth him an un|der&s;tanding.</HI> It is very ob&s;ervable, that one of the cho&s;en leaders of the people of I&s;rael, after having &s;olemnly, by way of commemoration, recounted the &s;ignal interpo&s;itions of divine Power, in the emancipation of that people from under the tyranny of Pharaoh, as one in|&s;tance of the divine goodne&s;s, he &s;aith <HI>he gave us also his good Spirit to in&s;truct us.</HI> This manife&s;|tation of him&s;elf by his Spirit, though extraor|dinarily di&s;pen&s;ed to many of the prophets, was more or le&s;s the privilege of every individual; and we find the royal p&s;almi&s;t frequently allud|ing to this principle, and rejoicing therein: <HI>The law,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the te&s;timony of the Lord is sure, making wise the &s;imple.</HI> The law, which he in this place in|tended,
<PB N="147" REF="027217_0145_0FD3E34B27489C30">
I conceive to be that law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which &s;ets us free from the law of &s;in and death.&mdash;A manife&s;tation hereof was given even under the former di&s;pen&s;ation of Mo&s;es; it was the conductor of that people, it was the &s;ource of their greate&s;t con&s;olation; for, they all <HI>drank of that rock that followed them; and that rock,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>was Chri&s;t. The law of the Lord,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is perfect;</HI> by which he could not intend the law of rituals peculiar to that di&s;pen&s;ation, or the &s;acrificial rites of the Jewi&s;h in&s;titution; <HI>for, the law,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>made nothing perfect.</HI> Again he in&s;tructeth us, that it made not perfect, as appertaining to the con&s;cience: it is not the blood of bulls or of goats, or the a&s;hes of an heifer, &s;prinkling the unclean, that could &s;anctify to the purifying of the con&s;cience; for, <HI>the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did,</HI> which hope is Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>That he (to wit, David) intended the primary divine law manife&s;ted by the Spirit of God unto his creatures, is evident from divers other places. &mdash;<HI>I delight,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in the law of the Lord;</HI> and again, <HI>blessed is the man whose delight is in the law

of the Lord, and in his law doth meditate day and night; he &s;hall be as a tree that is planted by the rivers of waters.</HI> And, that his chief felicity de|pended on an immediate union or communion with the God of I&s;rael, is very evident from that place, where, under the pre&s;&s;ure of his infirmi|ties, and con&s;cious of the want of &s;uperior aid, he breaks forth in this manner: <HI>My soul thir&s;teth for God, yea, for the living God;</HI> again, <HI>as the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul af|ter thee, O God.</HI></P>
<P>Many other pa&s;&s;ages might be produced, from the writings even of the Old Te&s;tament, while the Jewi&s;h tabernacle was yet remaining: but it is more, &s;till more, abundantly te&s;tified by our Saviour, and by his apo&s;tles. <HI>The manife&s;tation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</HI> &mdash;This is that principle of intelligence given us in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Lord, which the apo&s;tle intended, when he &s;aid, <HI>quench not the Spirit;</HI> which mu&s;t certainly mean the inward manife&s;tation of the Deity to the &s;oul, that grace, a mea&s;ure whereof is given to every man to profit withal; and that it could not mean any written manife&s;tation of him&s;elf,

or the Scriptures (which &s;ome have conceived was intended by the Spirit, who alledge, that the Spirit, or the will of God, being revealed unto holy men immediately, was mediately commu|nicated, through the in&s;trumentality of the Scrip|tures, to the re&s;t of mankind) is very evident; for, the canon of the New Te&s;tament was not made up till &s;ome hundreds of years after the writ|ing of this Epi&s;tle; nor doth it appear, that any epi&s;tles or writings of the evangeli&s;ts were collect|ed or completed even during the lives of the Apo&s;|tles.

<P>This principle of intelligence, this manife&s;ta|tion of the divine will, its effects, its properties, and its influence upon the human &s;oul, is &s;et forth under various figurative modes of expre&s;|&s;ion.

And therefore the office of the high prie&s;t of this di&s;pen&s;ation is &s;et forth, under the &s;ame figurative mode of expre&s;&s;ion, by him who was the forerunner of Chri&s;t, who was the voice of one crying in the wilderne&s;s, <HI>prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his path &s;trait.</HI> He baptized the people, as he &s;aid, indeed, with water, unto re|pentance; but when he &s;peaks of the mini&s;tra|tion of Je&s;us, which was to &s;ucceed his, he &s;aith, <HI>He, that cometh after me, is mightier than I; whose &s;hoe latchet I am not worthy to loose; he &s;hall bap|tize you with fire.</HI> Now it cannot be conceived that the material element of fire is intended, which would de&s;troy men's bodies; for Je&s;us Chri&s;t came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them. <HI>He &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t and with fire, whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, gather his wheat into his garner, and the chaff he will burn up with un|quenchable fire.</HI> This Scripture I adduce to &s;hew

that the effects of the Holy Spirit upon the ra|tional &s;oul, the &s;oul that is depraved by the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the divine law, and has contract|ed the defilement of &s;in, is analogous to the ope|ration of that element, that is adapted to purify and refine material bodies. Thus it is &s;aid, that a man, &s;anctified by the influence thereof, &s;hall become as pure as gold, yea, more pure than the golden wedge of Ophir. This I take to be the one e&s;&s;ential bapti&s;m, the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, which clean&s;eth men from all unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s, and which is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute us the proper object of <HI>that inheritance which is incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not a|way.</HI> For, the bapti&s;m that now &s;aves is not an elementary bapti&s;m; the bapti&s;m which now &s;aves is not the putting away the filth of the fle&s;h, than which nothing could be more ea&s;y for a man to effectuate; but, it is that which gives the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience towards God, by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath &s;aid, <HI>I am the resurrection and the life; he, who believeth on me, though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live; and he, who liveth and believeth on me, &s;hall never die.</HI></P>

In a moral &s;en&s;e, whatever a man does, whatever notion he cheri&s;hes in his heart of the vicious &s;pecies, what|ever licence he gives to his pa&s;&s;ions beyond the bounds pre&s;cribed by the divine law, operates as water on a flame; it damps its ardour.

Con&s;cious of my own weakne&s;s and my many infirmities, I &s;ecretly wi&s;hed to be &s;trengthened by him, who is the Mini&s;ter of the &s;anctuary and the glorious High Prie&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and, indeed, unle&s;s we are favoured with his pre&s;ence, we &s;hall &s;it as it were in darkne&s;s, and in the re|gions of the &s;hadow of death. If we feel not the influence of his Holy Spirit, effectually to quick|en us and in&s;pire us with the &s;pirit of devotion,
<PB N="164" REF="027217_0162_0FD3E370EC4DE758">
in vain &s;hall we lift up our hands and offer up the &s;acrifice of vocal prayer and prai&s;e unto him. It would be well if we had ever in remembrance, that of our&s;elves we are nothing, and of our|&s;elves can do nothing, I mean nothing that is e&s;&s;entially good. Unle&s;s in our religious a&s;&s;em|blies we are fir&s;t mini&s;tered unto by the chief Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of &s;ouls, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly mini&s;ter one to another. This the apo&s;tles very evidently &s;hew, particularly where one of them, alluding to his go&s;pel mini&s;try, &s;ays, <HI>that we may comfort others with the comfort wherewith we our|&s;elves are comforted of God.</HI> The di&s;ciple mu&s;t fir&s;t receive of his Lord, before he can di&s;pen&s;e it to his brethren. And it is therefore that we profe&s;s, I &s;ay, profe&s;s, at lea&s;t, to meet upon one common bottom, both mini&s;ters and tho&s;e in a private &s;tation, to wait, in all &s;inglene&s;s of heart, upon that Being, who regardeth the crying of the poor, and the &s;upplications of the needy; who, in a pecu|liar manner, will look unto that man who is poor, and of a contrite &s;pirit, and that trembleth at his word. And, <HI>though the youth may faint, and the young men utterly fall, yet those, who
<PB N="165" REF="027217_0163_0FD3E3722AFD5F00">
wait upon the Lord, &s;hall renew their &s;trength; they &s;hall mount upwards with wings as eagles; they &s;hall run, and not be weary; they &s;hall walk, and not faint.</HI></P>
<P>It might perhaps be a little profitable for us to inquire what we are to under&s;tand by the re|newing of our &s;trength: <HI>they, that wait upon the Lord, &s;hall renew their &s;trength.</HI> I conceive this to be intended purely in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e; for, if natural &s;trength be exhau&s;ted by labour or fatigue, it is to be recovered, in the ordinary cour&s;e of God's providence, only by re&s;t, and the application of &s;uitable nutritious food; but tho&s;e, who wait upon the Lord, &s;hall renew their &s;trength. Such are the nature and con&s;ti|tution of the human &s;oul, that, in order to be pre&s;erved and live to God, with a holy zeal for his name, and for his cau&s;e, to be endowed with &s;trength virtuou&s;ly to re&s;olve, and virtuou&s;ly to pur&s;ue the ju&s;t man's way, it mu&s;t be renewed by food that is of a &s;piritual nature; that, as bread is a term for natural food, which is adapt|ed to the &s;upport and well-being of our bodies, &s;o this &s;piritual food, renewed unto us by the re|newings of the Holy Gho&s;t, is that bread which
<PB N="166" REF="027217_0164_0FD3E3778440CA78">
indeed the world knoweth not of. The world that lieth in wickedne&s;s, the &s;en&s;uali&s;t, has no ta&s;te nor reli&s;h for that bread which cometh down from God out of heaven, and nouri&s;heth the &s;oul up unto eternal life.</P>
<P>Though, in the application which the di&s;ci|ples were in&s;tructed to make to the common Father of us all, outward ble&s;&s;ings might be in|cluded with &s;piritual ones, yet doubtle&s;s, as the welfare of the &s;oul is of infinitely more import|ance than the health and welfare of the body, in that part of the prayer, in which we are in|&s;tructed to &s;ay&mdash;Give us this day our daily bread, is principally intended that &s;piritual communi|cation with the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h, which imparts &s;trength and vigour to the &s;oul, animating it with a &s;pirit of real devotion, that it can a&s;cend above this lower and terre&s;trial &s;phere,&mdash;a&s;cend as upon <HI>the wings of an eagle,</HI> a bird which is &s;aid to approach the neare&s;t to that glorious natural luminary, the &s;un, in its flights. So, that &s;oul, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not only the &s;pirit of real religion, but al&s;o feels its be&s;t affections animated towards God, will have this privilege over the mere profe&s;&s;or of religion, that he will

a&s;cend as upon the wings of an eagle, a&s;cend in an awful contemplation of the divine attributes, in a meditation upon &s;piritual &s;ubjects, in a &s;train of holy and fervent devotion; he will a&s;|cend the mount of the Lord's holine&s;s, encom|pa&s;s his altar in the multitude of his mercies, and lift up his heart with his hands to that Being who inhabits the heavens.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of the&s;e truths, which we, as a religious &s;ociety, peculiarly pro|fe&s;s, let us, friends, not come to the&s;e meetings merely with an expectation of receiving benefit, edification or comfort one from another.

<P>I wi&s;h we were more and more impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of what we are, that the pride of hu|man nature were more effectually humbled; that we might look up to him who is the &s;ource of all that is excellent and good, and to u&s;e the lan|guage of the holy penman, <HI>feel after the Lord, if haply we might find him.</HI> And he, whom the fer|vent &s;oul is in &s;earch after, is not afar off; he, whom thou longe&s;t for, will &s;uddenly come unto his temple; but, <HI>who &s;hall abide the day of his coming? who &s;hall &s;tand when he appeareth?</HI> When the &s;oul is thus favoured with a &s;piritual commu|nion, and intellectual &s;en&s;e of the &s;upreme Being, it is then that every thing that is exalted becomes aba&s;ed; the loftine&s;s of man is brought down; he &s;ees him&s;elf as a worm, and no man; as un|worthy the lea&s;t of his mercies and truth; and therefore, in this view of him&s;elf and of the &s;u|preme Being, he will break forth, in the language of Job, <HI>I have heard of thee, by the hearing of the ear;</HI>&mdash;&s;o far the &s;peculati&s;t may go, &s;o far the

<HEAD>DISCOURSE IX.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THIS do, and thou &s;halt live.</HI> The&s;e words of our Lord revived in my remembrance at this meeting, and I have been led to advert to the occa&s;ion of their being delivered. It is, I think, written in one of the evangeli&s;ts: <HI>Behold, a cer|tain lawyer &s;tood up, and tempted him, &s;aying, Ma&s;|ter, what &s;hall I do to inherit everla&s;ting life?</HI> It is written, that he meant to tempt him; it fol|lows, of cour&s;e, that his motive, in propo&s;ing this que&s;tion, was not of the be&s;t kind; that it was not with a view of gaining information, but, if po&s;&s;ible, to en&s;nare him, and take an occa|&s;ion again&s;t him. But, our Lord, upon this as
<PB N="177" REF="027217_0175_0FD3E38734D5DD18">
well as upon every other occa&s;ion, manife&s;ted that wi&s;dom which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed above all other men, that wi&s;dom which directed all that he did, and all that he &s;aid; <HI>he spoke as never man spoke;</HI> he &s;poke with peculiar authority, and not as the &s;cribes. In&s;tead of making an immediate and di|rect an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, he previou&s;ly pro|po&s;ed one to him. <HI>What,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is written in the law? how reade&s;t thou?</HI> To which the lawyer replied, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord, thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy &s;trength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself.</HI> To which Je&s;us &s;aid, <HI>Thou ha&s;t an|swered right; this do, and thou &s;halt live.</HI> It &s;eem|eth to me, that this lawyer might apprehend, as &s;ome others did, who had a prejudice again&s;t Je&s;us, and the worthy cau&s;e which he promoted upon the earth, that he came to de&s;troy the law and the prophets, and to preach another law e&s;|&s;entially different from that which had been delivered to them, or that he di&s;pen&s;ed with the obligation of that, which, by way of di&s;tinction, is called the moral law. But our Saviour evin|ced that he came not to de&s;troy the law, but to fulfil it; he told them, that heaven and earth
<PB N="178" REF="027217_0176_0FD3E38A2592D9C8">
&s;hould &s;ooner pa&s;s away than one jot or tittle of the law &s;hould fail. Now the law which our Saviour intended, when he &s;ays, <HI>What is written in the law? How reade&s;t thou?</HI> could not be any part of the New Te&s;tament, becau&s;e none of that had been written; he therefore intended that law of commandments which is of univer|&s;al and indi&s;pen&s;able obligation, and is immuta|ble: <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy &s;trength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</HI> Now we are in&s;tructed that love is the fulfilling of the law; but in what &s;en&s;e is it the fulfilling of the law? Why, whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the love of God, will be induced, by the be&s;t motives, to &s;tudy his will, and to di&s;charge the obligation of his &s;everal religious duties to him. If he loves his neighbour, he will be induced to de&s;ire his welfare upon all occa&s;ions. He will &s;eek the intere&s;t and good of his neighbour; he will not only be ju&s;t, but merciful, kind and loving. And this definition perfectly agrees with that pa&s;&s;age, where it is &s;aid, <HI>Love worketh no ill to his neighbbour.</HI></P>
<P>Now I conceive that there is no other way
<PB N="179" REF="027217_0177_0FD3E38D49310318">
for us to obtain that mo&s;t de&s;irable object of being accepted of our Creator, who is the Judge of the whole earth, than to ob&s;erve tho&s;e &s;acred com|mandments on which hang all the law and the prophets. And it &s;eems to me, that there is much more of the love of God, and the love of our neighbour a&s;&s;umed, or profe&s;&s;ed, than is re|ally po&s;&s;e&s;sed at heart by mankind. The pride, the haughtine&s;s, the irreverence, with which they appear in the pre&s;ence of the omni&s;cient Being, be&s;peak that they po&s;&s;e&s;s not the love of him in their hearts. Ambition, avarice, and the vari|ous &s;pecies of vanity which have invaded the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of mankind, be&s;peak that they are void of the love of the God of heaven and of the whole earth. They, who ri&s;e up early, and go to bed late, in order to add hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and barn to barn, and bag to bag, and land to land, till there is nothing left for the poor of the earth; who improve every opportunity to mo|nopolize as much as po&s;&s;ible the ble&s;&s;ings of heav|en, and who&s;e thir&s;t &s;eems inexhau&s;tible; who are prompted by avarice, which is a pa&s;&s;ion that increa&s;es with the increa&s;e of years, and increa&s;es with the increa&s;e of riches; manife&s;t that the
<PB N="180" REF="027217_0178_0FD3E38F4E587470">
love of God is not in them: for, the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him;</HI> by which I under&s;tand, if a man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an inordinate love of the things of this world; if they &s;o take hold of his affections, and engro&s;s his attention, as to &s;teal from him that awe of God which ever ought to pervade his &s;oul; if it prevents his attention to the &s;tatutes and the commandments of heaven, and prevents his walking humbly and reverently through this &s;hort &s;cene of his pilgrimage; it is, and may be ju&s;tly called, that kind of love of the world which excludes the love of the &s;u|preme Being.</P>
<P>But, while it is &s;o little, I fear, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at heart, much is profe&s;&s;ed by all the &s;everal denom|inations of religion; however they may differ with re&s;pect to &s;peculative tenets, certain rituals, and modes of devotion, and articles of faith, they all profe&s;s to love God, all acknowledge the obligation of that and of the &s;ub&s;equent com|mandment; but it is to be feared that we often treat the &s;upreme Being in a manner &s;imilar to that which we u&s;e one towards another. A|mong manknd, there are great and &s;pecious pre|tences
<PB N="181" REF="027217_0179_0FD3E390D1EEE588">
of friend&s;hip, when perhaps there is but little really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at heart; and indeed &s;ome, under the &s;emblance of love and friend&s;hip, have only waited for an opportunity to &s;tab the repu|tation, or injure their neighbour in his property or per&s;on, with &s;ecurity from the la&s;h of the law. There are, who have made this profe&s;&s;ion as a cloak of maliciou&s;ne&s;s; and, while they have &s;aid, art thou in health, brother? have had a dag|ger concealed beneath the black di&s;gui&s;e. Now we are abundantly in&s;tructed, that, though we may, and too frequently do, deceive one another, and pa&s;s off ba&s;e metal for &s;terling coin, yet it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould deceive that awful Being with whom we have to do; he &s;ees not as man &s;ees; he looks beyond the veil of every cover|ing; he beholds the latent rece&s;&s;es of the human heart. Let us therefore not be deceived, for God is not mocked; that which every man &s;ows, that &s;hall he reap; if he &s;ows unto the fle&s;h, he &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption; but, if he &s;ows unto the &s;pirit, of the &s;pirit he &s;hall reap life everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>In vain &s;hall we call upon the name of the Lord, in vain &s;hall we &s;acrifice upon his altar, in
<PB N="182" REF="027217_0180_0FD3E39251808F70">
vain &s;hall we make many prayers, and &s;pread our hands towards the habitation of his holine&s;s, un|le&s;s we po&s;&s;e&s;s the love of him in the highe&s;t; and which, whoever po&s;se&s;ses, he will manife&s;t in the various branches of life, his conver&s;ation, and commerce among mankind. He will con&s;cienti|ou&s;ly di&s;charge his religious, his &s;ocial, his rela|tive, duties; and, in the &s;phere of his move|ment, he will manife&s;t the love of God by keep|ing his commandments. <HI>If ye love me</HI> (&s;ays our Lord) <HI>keep my commandments;</HI> and, if we would really become objects of his compla|cency, if we would be loved and honoured of that Being who made us for the purpo&s;e of his own glory, let us attend to the &s;olemn injunction of the author of the Chri&s;tian religion: <HI>Keep you therefore my commandments and abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.</HI></P>
<P>Let us not therefore apprehend, that any ar|ticles of faith, that any rituals of devotion, or any form of prayer that can po&s;&s;ibly be uttered, can be a &s;ub&s;titute for this affection of heart to|wards God, and which the con&s;ideration of his attributes will the mo&s;t powerfully engage us to

po&s;se&s;s. We have nothing that we have not re|ceived; he, the ancient of days, is the &s;ole pro|prietor of the univer&s;e, the Lord of ho&s;ts; he is one, and his name is one. We, the inhab|itants of his foot&s;tool, are but tenants at will. The earth is the Lord's, and the fulne&s;s thereof, and the cattle of a thou&s;and hills are his. And &s;eeing we po&s;se&s;s nothing but what we have de|rived from him, that all the ble&s;&s;ings which we have received are owing to his bounty and good|ne&s;s, we ought not to boa&s;t as if we had not re|ceived them, but with all humility acknowledge his manifold goodne&s;s, and to offer unto him the &s;acrifice of an undivided heart. It is the lan|guage of wi&s;dom to the &s;ons of men, <HI>My &s;on give me thy heart.</HI> Our be&s;t affections will be en|gaged; then, indeed, we &s;hall po&s;se&s;s the very &s;pirit of devotion; for, whoever po&s;se&s;ses not the love of God po&s;se&s;ses not the &s;pirit of devotion; his hands may be lifted up towards the habitation of his holine&s;s, but his heart lies groveling on the earth; he is wor&s;hipping the gods of this world, &s;ilver and gold, and therefore the lifting up of his hands, and the verbal oblation of his mouth, will not be acceptable incen&s;e upon that

&s;acred altar, whereof tho&s;e who &s;erve the tabernacle have no right to partake.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h that we might improve &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons as this in a particular manner, to contemplate the divine attributes, to reflect and think upon his name, to recollect the in&s;tances of his goodne&s;s, of his power, and of his wi&s;dom, that &s;o we may feel our affections more and more &s;et upon things that are above, le&s;s and le&s;s upon things which are beneath, which are but of a tran&s;itory nature, and which peri&s;h with the u&s;ing. This was the injunction of the apo&s;tle: <HI>Set your affection on things above, and not on things on the earth.</HI> This indeed is to be &s;piritually minded, as it is writ|ten, <HI>to be carnally minded is death, but to be &s;pirit|ually minded is life and peace.</HI></P>
<P>If we were really concerned to po&s;se&s;s this love of God, it would not only manife&s;t it&s;elf in the various branches of our religious duty, but al&s;o tho&s;e of a &s;ocial and relative kind. I think we are &s;omewhere told, that, for a man to &s;ee his fellow-creature in di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;hut up his bow|els again&s;t him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? And the apo&s;tle rea&s;ons very aptly: <HI>If,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>we love not our brother, whom we have &s;een,
<PB N="185" REF="027217_0183_0FD3E39A24E10E28">
how &s;hall we love God, whom we have not seen,</HI> who is not an object of &s;en&s;e, who is inapproachable? No man hath &s;een him, nor can &s;ee him; and, as we are incapable of rendering any thing unto God, who is ab&s;olutely perfect, it &s;eems that he accepts of the good offices we do for one another as if they had been done unto him, and he was capable of being benefited by them. This is il|lu&s;trated by our Lord with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who had neglected him: <HI>I was an-hungered, and ye fed me not; naked, and ye clothed me not; &s;ick and in prison, and ye vi&s;ited me not;</HI> to which they made this reply: <HI>When saw we thee an-hungered, or naked, or &s;ick, or in prison, and did not mini&s;ter unto thee?&mdash;Inasmuch,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>as ye did it not to one of the lea&s;t of these my brethren, ye did it not unto me;</HI> and again, to tho&s;e who received him, it is &s;aid, <HI>I was an-hungered, and ye fed me; naked, and ye clothed me,</HI> or words to the &s;ame import; <HI>I was &s;ick and in prison, and ye visited me.</HI> Now the&s;e po&s;se&s;sed that mode&s;ty which is peculiar to good men; they an&s;wered: <HI>When saw we thee an-hun|gered, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and mini&s;tered unto thee?&mdash;Inasmuch,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>as ye have done it to one of the lea&s;t of these little ones, you have

done it to me.</HI>&mdash;Who are the&s;e little ones? I con|ceive that we are all, by creation, God's little ones; he &s;tands in the relation of a father to all ranks and cla&s;&s;es of human beings; he of one blood has made all nations to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habit|ation; and, as he has made them of one blood, &s;o he looks upon them with an everla&s;ting love, which di&s;criminates not the per&s;ons of men; for, he is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons; but, in every nation, he, that feareth God and worketh righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted of him. And, that the little ones, in this place, intended not any pecu|liar cla&s;s, to me is very evident; becau&s;e, we are under an obligation to do good to the unrigh|teous as well as the righteous, to the unju&s;t as well as the ju&s;t; not only to be loving to our friends, but to love our enemies, to do good to all; to put up our prayers, not for this or that peculiar cla&s;s of per&s;ons, but to addre&s;s our prayers for the va&s;t community of creatures:&mdash; <HI>I exhort,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>that prayers and suppli|cations be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and

peaceable life, in all godliness and hone&s;ty.</HI> We are to pray for the righteous, that they may be con|firmed in their ways;&mdash;for the wicked, that they may be reformed. We are to pray not only for our friends; for, if we love them that love us, what do we more than others? It is natural to have an affection for them who have an affection for us; but we mu&s;t go farther than this, we mu&s;t love them that hate us, and pray for them that per&s;ecute us. If we po&s;&s;e&s;s this &s;pirit of mind, if love prevails to all, then we &s;hall ever have occa&s;ion, as our Lord &s;aid, rather to rejoice than to be &s;orrowful if we &s;hall be maltreated by tho&s;e who&s;e intere&s;t we have endeavoured to promote:&mdash;<HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye</HI> (&s;ays our Lord) <HI>when men &s;hall say all manner of evil again&s;t you, falsely, for my sake; rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.</HI> Now I wi&s;h that this affection of love, the love of God and of our neighbour, were more really felt at heart than it appears to be.</P>
<P>The love of our neighbour means not, in the common acceptation of the term, the people who&s;e local habitation is near ours, and who lend us &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as we are in&s;tructed in the
<PB N="188" REF="027217_0186_0FD3E39FF8A9D430">
ca&s;e of the Samaritan and the poor Jew, when it was a&s;ked our Lord, who is my neighbour? It &s;eemed good &s;ometimes to him to an&s;wer the que&s;tions propo&s;ed to him by a parable. It was peculiar to tho&s;e times and that part of the world; and, &s;o frequent was it, that it is laid of our Lord, that without a parable &s;pake he not unto them. A certain man, &s;ays he, went down from Jeru&s;alem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who &s;tripped him, and wounded him, and departed leaving him half dead. Here was an object for Chri&s;tian benevolence to exerci&s;e it&s;elf upon; here was an in&s;tance in which the love of our neighbour &s;hould have been exerci&s;|ed; but it &s;eems that tho&s;e, who ought to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;hare of friendly affections, tho&s;e who waited upon the &s;ervice of the altar, wanted this affection. The Prie&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by, the Levite followed his example; tho&s;e, who ought to have been the fir&s;t to &s;et an example of mercy, loving-kindne&s;s, and charity, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that affection, which would engage us, by every means in our power, to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and wipe away the tears of the afflicted. In &s;hort, &s;o much &s;tre&s;s is laid upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this affection,
<PB N="189" REF="027217_0187_0FD3E39EC816DCA0">
and exerci&s;ing it in charity and kindne&s;s one to|wards another, that it is &s;aid to be the religion which is pure and undefiled, not a religion of &s;peculation and theory: <HI>Pure religion, and unde|filed before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep ourselves unspotted from the world.</HI></P>
<P>The Prie&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by; the Levite al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed by. At length, it &s;eems, a Samaritan came that way; and, though there had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted an enmity between the Jews and the Samaritans, yet he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much of the love of God and his neighbour, that it overcame the prejudice of his education; though the object that claimed this attention was a Jew, he took compa&s;&s;ion on him in this &s;tate, and did not, as we often do to one another, pour in a mixture of wormwood and gall, to aggravate the wounds, rather than the oil of love, to alleviate and a&s;&s;uage them. He poured in oil and wine; and not only &s;o, but he looked forwards, and provided for his fu|ture &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; he &s;ent him to an inn, and, when he departed, directed the ho&s;t to take care of him, &s;aying, What&s;oever thou &s;pende&s;t, when I come again, I will repay thee.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="027217_0188_0FD3E3A292999CA8">This is &s;et forth as an example to us, which we &s;hould by all means attempt to imitate.

O thou omni&s;cient Being, who knowe&s;t us altogether as we are, grant, we be&s;eech thee, that, under the influence of the light of the Go&s;pel of thy Son, we may &s;ee our|&s;elves as we are &s;een of thee; that, in the depth

O let the con&s;ideration of thine attributes and of our own unworthine&s;s humble us yet more and more in thy pre&s;ence; that, po&s;se&s;sed with a filial fear of thee, we may in future be more circum&s;pect in our goings; and that we may &s;eek, and be able to di&s;criminate, the ju&s;t man's way, and to walk in it, whch, as the bright and &s;hining light, &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day. O grant that we may be more and more enamoured with the love of virtue; that we may more and more prefer the narrow and the &s;trait gate, which leads to life, rather than the broad way of &s;en&s;ual indulgence, that leads to the gates of death, and ultimately will involve &s;uch as per&s;evere therein in the pit of perdition.</P>
<P>O mo&s;t adorable Je&s;us, increa&s;e our faith and love, and increa&s;e the friendly affections of our &s;ouls one towards another, that we may be

<P>O thou, who art the pre&s;erver of men, influ|ence us more and more, by thy Spirit, that we may lay a&s;ide every weight and every burden, and the &s;in which doth &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et us; and run with patience the race which is &s;et before us; and &s;o to run, as that we may obtain the crown immortal, that &s;hall never fade away.

<P>O thou mo&s;t righteous Being, in a &s;en&s;e of thy goodne&s;s, we would approach thy altar, and a&s;|cribe to thee might, maje&s;ty, and dominion, with every other excellent and adorable attribute, now, henceforth, and forevermore. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE X.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER an apprehen&s;ion of duty, I have frequently laboured among you, in word and doctrine, for a &s;eries of years. What effect it has had on tho&s;e who have heard me, I cannot pre&s;ume to determine; if I were, indeed, to judge by appearances, I &s;hould conclude the obvious effects to be but little. But, there is a matter on which I am fully competent to determine: my motives have been of the be&s;t kind, the love of God, and the love of my fellow-creatures; that love which worketh no ill, but would by all po&s;&s;ible methods promote the e&s;sential intere&s;t of its neighbours; and, having from time to
<PB N="199" REF="027217_0197_0FD3E2F58B84DA40">
time di&s;charged what I apprehended to be my re|ligious duty, I have therein found great peace. This, to my&s;elf, at lea&s;t, has been the effect of my public labours; and though it is probable, that what I have &s;ometimes delivered, may have been more or le&s;s &s;imilar to that which I have aforetime delivered, yet I hope, that even a re|petition of doctrines and advices, which we are urged to deliver, from a &s;en&s;e of duty, may not be as water &s;pilt upon a &s;tone, but may have a tendency (if not to convey any material informa|tion to the under&s;tanding) to &s;tir up at lea&s;t the pure mind, by way of remembrance.</P>
<P>We have heard much; we have had line upon line, and precept upon precept; and there have been &s;ent among us, who, as good &s;cribes, out of their trea&s;ury, have brought forth things new and old. But, the e&s;&s;ential important doctrines, which re&s;pect in particular our practical duties, make, it is to be feared, but a &s;light impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of men, even upon tho&s;e who are very fond of hearing, and have perhaps much to &s;ay concerning the my&s;teries of faith; who, whil&s;t they lay much &s;tre&s;s upon &s;peculative o|pinions, have po&s;se&s;sed too little of that real

Chri&s;tian love and zeal, which manife&s;ts it&s;elf by a conduct con&s;i&s;tent with the commandments of the Author of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation. We want to be &s;tirred up, to be excited to do that, which we want not to be in&s;tructed it is our duty to do. But, if there be any, in this auditory, who&s;e under&s;tandings may have been bewildered in a long and tedious pur&s;uit of &s;peculative no|tions; or who have attempted, though but with little &s;ucce&s;s, to inve&s;tigate ab&s;tru&s;e points, and to comprehend my&s;teries which the wi&s;dom of the Holy Gho&s;t may &s;ee meet to conceal from the fool|i&s;hne&s;s of men (the prying curio&s;ity of the creature, who is more apt to inquire than to obey) if there be any &s;uch, who are yet un&s;atisfied with regard to tho&s;e grand &amp; e&s;&s;ential points, upon which their acceptance with the common Father of the hu|man race depends; if there be any who are under the pre&s;&s;ure of manifold &s;ins and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, are in doubt with re&s;pect to tho&s;e means which are nece&s;&s;ary to be pur&s;ued, in order that their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions may be forgiven of God, and that they may be accepted of him; if there be any, who, in the angui&s;h of their &s;ouls, have their hands upon their loins, with <HI>What &s;hall I do to be saved?</HI>

it &s;eems to me to be my duty to &s;tate them a ca&s;e, nearly perhaps as we have it repre&s;ented in the holy Scriptures, re&s;pecting one, formerly, who propo&s;ed a que&s;tion of this &s;ort.</P>
<P><HI>How &s;hall I come before the Lord? or wherewithal &s;hall I bow myself before the mo&s;t high God?

What &s;hall I do to recommend my&s;elf to the divine notice, to have the load of my &s;ins taken off? my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions cancelled from the book of his remembrance? In an&s;wer to this, he was &s;hewn that that which God required of man, as e&s;&s;ential to his acceptance with him, was ea&s;ily to be apprehended, and within the compa&s;s of his power to perform; that is to &s;ay, of man, favoured with the manife&s;tation of the Spirit of God, and &s;trengthened by his grace.</P>
<P><HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good; and

what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</HI> Here our e&s;&s;ential duties are &s;ummed up under three heads, which indeed comprehend much&mdash; The fir&s;t is <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> A man mu&s;t be morally ju&s;t before he can be religiou&s;ly good; whereas we oft-times &s;ee the divine order perverted, and that men are more zealous to be connected with par|ties, and more zealous for the intere&s;t of a &s;ect, than to maintain even the character of common hone&s;ty.</P>
<P><HI>Do ju&s;tly.</HI>&mdash;Now the obligation of ju&s;tice is void of any kind of perplexity. We no &s;ooner reflect upon the relation man &s;tands in to man, but the propriety of ju&s;tice is clear. We are without excu&s;e, if we neglect to do ju&s;tice; and though this perhaps may come under the appel|lation of what is called a moral duty, let us not think meanly of moral duties; for, notwith|&s;tanding the variety of &s;peculative doctrines pub|li&s;hed here and there, and curious di&s;tinctions made upon points of religion, what is the &s;tate of moral ju&s;tice among us? Let us look abroad among mankind; &s;hall we not have cau&s;e to ap|prehend, of many, that their wits are employed,

It &s;eems to be the &s;tudy of a great part of mankind, to outwit and deceive the other; in&s;tances of notorious breaches of ju&s;tice &s;trike us on every hand, &amp; eve|ry where, and which people are the more prompt|ed to commit, from a de&s;ire of a luxurious and pompous mode of life, which is too generally prevalent among mankind.

<P>I am concerned at heart, friends, to revive in your remembrance the obligation of ju&s;tice. We mu&s;t be ju&s;t and righteous before we &s;hall be good; and it &s;eems that our Lord laid a peculiar &s;tre&s;s on what are called moral doctrines, that of ju&s;tice, and that of mercy; in&s;omuch that he &s;ays, <HI>If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses;</HI> and again he &s;ays (which is worthy of note it is called the

All human laws, &s;o far as they are con&s;i&s;tent with propriety, are founded in, and con&s;i&s;tent with, this gen|eral law, which comprehends all relations and connections among mankind:&mdash;<HI>Whatsoever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even so to them,</HI> If we would wi&s;h to appear with hone&s;|ty to our neighbours, let us act in the manner we would wi&s;h them to act to us.

As, in a time of di&s;|tre&s;s, we would wi&s;h to have the &s;ympathy of our neighbours, and the hand of relief extended to us, let us not forget the needy in the time of our pro&s;perity, but do to them as we would they &s;hould do to us.

through &s;ociety, and it is our duty to adverti&s;e one another in hours of peril; and where we can do no po&s;itive good, we &s;hould endeavour to pre|vent all po&s;&s;ible evil. The&s;e are duties which we want not &s;o much to be convinced of, as to be effectually incited to perform. But &s;uch is the weakne&s;s of human nature, that people are more fond of taking up with &s;ub&s;criptions to articles of faith, and of attendance to ordinances, and wi&s;h to get rid of their &s;ins in that way, and herein &s;hew a great zeal; but that falls &s;hort of the rectitude which the go&s;pel enjoins, and is the end of the law, and the end of the com|ing of Chri&s;t, and of offering him&s;elf a &s;acrifice for &s;in to produce order and righteou&s;ne&s;s among all ranks of men. This was one of the ends of his coming; and however &s;pecious our profe&s;&s;ions may be, however deeply we may enter into the my&s;teries of the kingdom of heaven, yet if we po&s;&s;e&s;s not the &s;pirit of charity, and motives to u&s;t ice and benevolence, what is it? <HI>If I &s;peak,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>with the tongues of men and an|gels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal; and though I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;teries, and all

Let us not content our&s;elves with the &s;emblance of holine&s;s and charity, but let us hold the my&s;tery of the faith, in a pure con&s;cience: for it is po&s;&s;ible people may conceive right notions of things, and yet, for want of receiving them as a principle influencing their actions, they may hold the truth, but hold it in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; but

<P>Our Saviour, in his mini&s;try, was gentle in his addre&s;s, and per&s;ua&s;ive in his language. When he addre&s;&s;ed the publicans and &s;inners, he found more openne&s;s to receive the go&s;pel among this rank of people, than tho&s;e who had the form of godline&s;s, but denied the power thereof; in&s;o|much, that it became a proverb, that he was the friend of publicans and &s;inners; for which con|duct he gave this e&s;&s;ential rea&s;on, that he came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repent|ance. <HI>Where the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</HI> Among the&s;e people there was a di&s;po&s;ition to receive him; and among o|ther things which the me&s;&s;engers of John were required to te&s;tify that they had &s;een, was, that the poor had the go&s;pel preached to them. How did this friend of publicans and &s;inners, who &s;poke with &s;o much gentlene&s;s, behave when he came to addre&s;s the &s;uperior characters, in all the pomp of their &s;anctity, who made broad the phylacteries, who were zealous for the written and oral traditions of their fathers? <HI>O ye gene|ration of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of

While I am zealous to plead for the obligation of ju&s;tice among men, and the di&s;charge of the duties of &s;ocial relations, I would by no means forget that there is a ju&s;tice due to the glorious Father of all we po&s;&s;e&s;s. He has made us, not we our&s;elves; we are his off|spring; he has communicated to us a variety of temporal and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, and we ought, in point of gratitude, in point of ju&s;tice, to make a proper application of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, to render to him the duty that ari&s;es from the relation that we &s;tand in to him as his children, the offspring of the everla&s;ting Father; and, therefore, he calls upon us, <HI>my son, give me thy heart.</HI> He would not require that of us which is not in point of ju&s;tice our duty to comply with: give me thy heart; give me the be&s;t of thy affections; mani|fe&s;t thy love to me by keeping my command|ments, as a good &s;teward; for, we are all, all ranks and cla&s;&s;es of beings are, &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God; and it is required of

Let us fir&s;t confe&s;s our faults; let us not cover our &s;ins, or &s;eek to hide them; for, he that hides his &s;ins &s;hall not pro&s;per: let us acknowledge our &s;ins; let us encompa&s;s his altar in the multitude of his mercies; let us po&s;&s;e&s;s the penitential af|fection of the poor publican, while the Phari&s;ee could boa&s;t of his fa&s;ting twice in a week, giv|ing alms of all he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and not being as other men, even as the poor publican. Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e pompous words, he was not accepted. The poor publican had nothing to plead, no merit to recommend him; and, there|fore, under the contemplation of the infinite Ma|je&s;ty he was about to approach, he had not

The forgivene&s;s of &s;ins is purely owing to the the mediation and interce&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but the work of conver&s;ion requires and calls upon the object to be a co-worker with the influence of grace to purify the &s;oul, and turn its feet into the ju&s;t man's path, which is as the &s;hining light, that &s;hineth more and more unto the per|fect day.

<P><HI>IT is appointed unto men once to die.</HI> This is one of tho&s;e propo&s;itions which no man is &s;o weak as to deny. But the &s;acred penman proceeds farther,&mdash;<HI>and, after death, cometh the judgment.</HI> This, al&s;o, is a propo&s;ition which is of cour&s;e admitted, in terms, by every one who profe&s;&s;es to be a Chri&s;tian, or a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t; and, indeed, this propo&s;ition is of the mo&s;t awful and affecting nature. We mu&s;t all &s;tand before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, and receive a recom|pence of reward according as our works have been. A Judge, who is infallible, who will not deceive, nor can po&s;&s;ibly be deceived; he taketh cognizance not only of our outward actions, but
<PB N="217" REF="027217_0215_0FD3E3CB7A510FD8">
he penetrates the very thoughts and intents of all our hearts; and &s;eeing that he will not condemn the innocent, nor acquit the guilty,&mdash;on this re|flection, methinks, it would be well for us, as it were, to lay our hands upon our hearts, and a&s;k our&s;elves this que&s;tion,&mdash;What manner of crea|tures ought we to be? The Author of our being is a God of infinite purity and holine&s;s; nothing can be united unto him, no being admitted to dwell in his pre&s;ence (in which there is fulne&s;s of joy) who is in a &s;tate of impurity: there, nothing that worketh an abomination, or that loveth and maketh a lie, can have an entrance: for, it is po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted by the highe&s;t author|ity, that, without holine&s;s, no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord. On the contrary, it is declared, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart, for they &s;hall see God:</HI> that they &s;hall have that union and communion with him, on which the happine&s;s of all ranks and cla&s;&s;es of intelligent beings mo&s;t certainly de|pends.

We have all &s;inned: we have all fallen &s;hort of the glory of God. In this &s;tate, therefore, whatever vain expectations any may entertain, they are not fit &s;ubjects of the kingdom of heaven: they are under the power and government of the prince of the power of the air, which ruleth in the hearts of the chil|dren of di&s;obedience. Tho&s;e, therefore, who are in this &s;tate, have no ground of hope of being admitted into the kingdom of the ju&s;t; there is no communion between light and darkne&s;s there is no fellow&s;hip between Chri&s;t and Belial; and, indeed, our Lord po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, <HI>If ye die in your &s;ins, where I go ye &s;hall not come;</HI> therefore, tho he came (the me&s;&s;enger from the Father was the Son of God, the eternal Word) with the glad tidings of the go&s;pel to all the inhabitants of the earth, yet his coming became effectual only to tho&s;e who received him. <HI>I came,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>to my own, but my own received me not; but, to as many as received met gave 1 power to become the Sons of God;</HI> as much as to &s;ay, Be ye not deceived, and imagine, that, in con&s;equence of my coming, you

No: the purpo&s;e of my coming is not to &s;ave you in, but to &s;ave you from, your &s;ins; and it is a &s;aying that is worthy of all acceptation, <HI>that Jesus Chri&s;t came into the world to save &s;inners.</HI> The &s;criptures propo&s;e to us, and in a very explicit and com|prehen&s;ive manner, what we mu&s;t be before we can be accepted of his Father, who is in heaven. <HI>Repent,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and be converted, that your sins may be forgiven you:</HI> &s;o that it &s;eems that we mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, repent of tho&s;e &s;ins which we have committed.

<P>If we were thus to contemplate the na|ture of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, we, indeed, &s;hould become circum&s;pect, we &s;hould be &s;eri|ous, we &s;hould be inqui&s;itive; and this prayer would become, as it were, habitual: <HI>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me;</HI> for, as it is the heart that is the object of conver&s;ion, by the power of an endle&s;s life, &s;o it is the &s;eat of &s;in.

<P><HI>OF a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted of him.</HI> I pre&s;ume that mo&s;t of you are acquainted with the particular cau&s;e of this declaration.&mdash;that an eminent apo&s;|tle of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;eemed to have been of the opinion, that the go&s;pel me&s;|&s;age was not to extend unto the Gentiles. This was, perhaps, founded upon Jewi&s;h prejudice; and we are in&s;tructed, in this in&s;tance, of the power of prejudice to &s;top the ears, and blind the eyes, of a wi&s;e man. The mo&s;t worthy and mo&s;t exalted characters have, more or le&s;s, man|ife&s;ted in their conduct the power of prejudice&mdash; the prejudice of education; and, indeed, the wrong impre&s;&s;ions, which mankind receive in their minority, generally are la&s;ting, or with dif|ficulty era&s;ed. They &s;eem to be like characters
<PB N="231" REF="027217_0229_0FD3E3E7DCF80BD0">
which are cut out upon a tree, which grow wider, and frequently deeper, in proportion to the growth of the tree. Thus many prejudices, which mankind have received at an early time of life, are &s;uch, that they have not been capable of clearly di&s;tingui&s;hing one object from another. They, as it were, grow with their growth, and are &s;trengthened with their &s;trength. I conceive the&s;e are tho&s;e &s;ecret faults which the P&s;almi&s;t in|tended when he &s;aid, <HI>Who can under&s;tand his er|rors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults.</HI> It &s;eems that an extraordinary di&s;pen&s;ation of divine pro|vidence effectually removed this prejudice from the mind of the holy apo&s;tle. He was favoured with a vi&s;ion, in which he &s;aw, as it were, a &s;heet let down from heaven, containing various &s;pecies of animals; and he was commanded to ari&s;e, to &s;lay, and to eat; but he endeavoured to excu&s;e him&s;elf by &s;aying, that he had not eaten any thing that is common or unclean; upon which he was taught not to call that common or unclean which God had clean&s;ed. The man to whom he was &s;ent was a man of a &s;incere heart; his heart was right towards God; to him the glad tidings of the go&s;pel were publi&s;hed, though he was a heathen. The mercy of God, through

Je&s;us Chri&s;t, makes not that di&s;tinction, per&s;onal di&s;tinction, between the human &s;pecies which the law of Mo&s;es made among the inferior ani|mals, &s;ome of which were forbidden as unclean.

He &s;aw that Im|manuel was a light to enlighten the Gentiles as well as to be the glory of the people of I&s;rael. <HI>I have set him to be a light to the Gentiles, to be for salvation unto the ends of the earth;</HI> not within the narrow circle of any party of human beings, not within the limits of any &s;pot upon the face of the globe, but to be for &s;alvation to the very ends of the earth.

errors; whereas the ob&s;tinate may be compared to a man who &s;huts his eyes, and, of cour&s;e, will not be enabled to di&s;criminate objects even at noon-day; but the man, who begins to &s;u&s;pect that he errs, or that he may err, begins to open the door of his heart to conviction, and the apo&s;|tle &s;eemed to have had &s;ome glimmering of this glorious truth; but now the &s;cales of prejudice fell from his eyes: his mental &s;ight was clear. <HI>Of a truth,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I perceive that God is no re|specter of persons, but he that feareth God, and work|eth righteousness, is accepted of him;</HI> and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, though it very unexpectedly appears to be my duty to confe&s;s it now, that, of all tho&s;e doctrines which I conceive to be errors, of all tho&s;e things which I conceive are not agreeable either to rea&s;on, to the nature of things, or to the Scriptures of truth, there is not one which to me is &s;o palpable as the doctrine of partial election and reprobation; that is to &s;ay, that God, by virtue of his &s;overeignty, did, of his own good will and plea&s;ure, create a certain number of intelligent beings, not only fore&s;eeing that they would &s;in, and be la&s;tingly mi&s;erable, but for that very purpo&s;e; that their mi&s;ery is in con&s;equence of his eternal decree; that the other

part, whether few or more, are ordained to ever|la&s;ting life; not in con&s;ideration of any merit which they po&s;&s;e&s;s (for, it is acknowledged that the elect po&s;&s;e&s;s no more merit than the repro|bate; that the righteou&s;ne&s;s with which they are clothed is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; that they are &s;aved by virtue of the propitiatory &s;acrifice of the Son of God; that, by nature, they are black, they are vile, as the reprobate, but that they are comely with grace, as they &s;tand related to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who is the head of his Church;) not in con&s;ideration therefore of any thing they can merit, but of God's &s;overeign plea&s;ure. But I would wi&s;h every one pre&s;ent &s;eriou&s;ly to con|&s;ider whether a greater reflection could be ca&s;t upon the divine attributes, unle&s;s it were to &s;ay that he created all mankind to be eternally mi&s;|erable. That God, the Father of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h, to whom we are indebted for our exi&s;tence, and who of his plea&s;ure did create us, &s;hould do it with a view of making us, or any part of his creatures, everla&s;tingly mi&s;erable, is &s;uch an idea that I confe&s;s &s;hocks me. I &s;ay it &s;hocks me. <HI>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</HI> He is not only a God of ju&s;tice, but he is a God of goodne&s;s; but how can this be reconciled with

goodne&s;s, that a being &s;hould purpo&s;ely bring others into being in order to make them mi&s;era|ble? It is repugnant to every idea that I can form of the Deity. It is a di&s;po&s;ition, indeed, that appears to me to be&s;peak the nature of a ty|rant, the nature of that being who is &s;aid to go about like a roaring lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour; but this, as well as other erroneous doc|trines, is &s;aid to be founded upon the Scriptures. Thus the Scriptures are made to contradict them|&s;elves, the literal &s;en&s;e is adopted where that &s;en&s;e coincides with the preconceived opinion; but, where the literal &s;en&s;e accords not with that o|pinion, it is tortured a thou&s;and ways to expre&s;s what the Holy Gho&s;t never intended,&mdash;whatever the parties wi&s;h it to &s;peak. Thus pa&s;&s;age, ob|viou&s;ly figurative, have been con&s;idered as literal; and others, appearing plain, even to common &s;en&s;e, to experience, to our common feelings, and to the nature of things, &s;uch have been rendered my&s;terious by various comments, in which truth has been ob&s;cured by the multitude of words without knowledge. But, I conceive, if we con|&s;ider the holy Scriptures, from the fir&s;t chapter of Gene&s;is to the la&s;t in Revelations; if we are capable of laying a&s;ide our prejudices; we &s;hall

&s;ee that they do a&s;&s;ert the unity of God, his &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, his omnipotence, his omni&s;cience. The univer&s;ality of his love to his creatures is the &s;cope and tendency of the &s;acred pages, and <HI>that</HI> the motive of all the di&s;pen&s;ations of his provi|dence to mankind. His views (if I may u&s;e that expre&s;&s;ion of the Ancient of days) terminated not upon him&s;elf, who is incapable of an acce&s;|&s;ion of happine&s;s, neither upon the mi&s;ery of his creatures, to which he could have no motive, but they terminated in the creature who is capable of immortality and eternal life. The Supreme Being I conceive to be the only perfectly di&s;in|tere&s;ted being in the univer&s;e; perhaps a parent for in&s;tance (if the compari&s;on may at all be al|lowed) a wi&s;e, an affectionate parent, may bear &s;ome humble re&s;emblance of the univer&s;al Fa|ther. He is often &s;et forth to us under the endearing character of our Father: <HI>as a Father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</HI> He knows our frame, he remembers that we are but du&s;t; but the pa|rent who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mo&s;t delicate parental feel|ings, di&s;covers the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude for the happine&s;s of his offspring, and will find his hap|pine&s;s intimately connected therewith. Such
<PB N="237" REF="027217_0235_0FD3E3F1933B4B48">
is the nature of that affection, &s;trangthened by moral ties, that a parent and his offspring may be &s;aid to be connected by &s;o many fibres of the heart: his happine&s;s is bound up in his off|&s;pring: he mu&s;t rejoice when they rejoice, and &s;uffer when they are afflicted. In alleviating their afflictions, he alleviates his own: in pro|moting the happine&s;s of his children, he pro|motes his own felicity; but, re&s;pecting the di|vine Being, the analogy will not &s;trictly hold. <HI>Thy righteousness,</HI> as the text &s;aith, <HI>may profit the son of man, and thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art.</HI> The ob&s;ervance of the laws of virtue, of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth, would promote the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. It would produce that harmony throughout all the cla&s;&s;es of &s;ocial life, in which the greate&s;t degree of happine&s;s is to be experienced. Vice, on the contrary, is not only prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of the individual, but its evil influence extends, far and wide, with|in the circumference of &s;ociety. Therefore, our righteou&s;ne&s;s may profit men as we are, our wickedne&s;s may hurt the children of men, but our righteou&s;ne&s;s cannot profit him who is perfect, ab&s;olutely perfect, ab&s;olutely good, &s;elf-&s;ufficient, the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day,

and forever, with whom there is no varia|blene&s;s, neither &s;hadow of turning. It is not the united &s;upplications of all the &s;ouls within the limits of his va&s;tly extended empire that can add to his e&s;&s;ential glory, that can add to his felicity; neither is it the neglect of the wor&s;hip of all ranks and orders of intelligent creatures that can dimini&s;h his glory, that can decrea&s;e his felicity; therefore, his motive, in creating and communicating good to his crea|tures, mu&s;t be a motive perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted: it is love without the lea&s;t &s;pecies of alloy. God's love was the adorable motive of his mak|ing beings capable of contemplating his attri|butes, and of that felicity which is derived from him: this was the glorious motive (if I may be indulged to &s;peak of the divine Being by attri|buting to him motives) that induced him to cre|ate the various orders and cla&s;&s;es of intelligent beings, in this and every other &s;phere, from the &s;eraph above, that attends upon the &s;acred throne, to the lowe&s;t link in the &s;cale of rational, intelli|gent creatures. And, in thus contemplating the Deity, I find the be&s;t affections of my heart ex|cited towards him, my parent, in a &s;en&s;e infinite|ly &s;uperior to that natural relation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="239" REF="027217_0237_0FD3E3F62CCE2B48">
among the human &s;pecies and creatures: and, under this character, are we in&s;tructed to ap|proach the Supreme Being, <HI>Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name;</HI> in which there is &s;omething that &s;trikes me with peculiar force, that individuals, when they approach the &s;acred altar of the Lord Almighty, and prefer their petitions to him who &s;ees in &s;ecret, are not to con&s;ider them&s;elves as detached from &s;ociety; they are not to implore the ble&s;&s;ing for them|&s;elves alone. It is not <HI>my</HI> Father, but <HI>our</HI> Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; by which we are in&s;tructed, that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, that we all &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to him, who is the God and Father of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h. Remember that the Scripture de|clares, that he is good to all. Can he be good to them, whom, by an eternal, irrevocable decree, he has con&s;igned to everla&s;ting mi&s;ery? But God is good to all; therefore he has not prede&s;tinat|ed to everla&s;ting mi&s;ery the creature he has form|ed, which would be, in the mo&s;t obvious &s;en&s;e of the words, to be a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, and mu&s;t ari&s;e from a motive of partiality. We are in&s;tructed to re&s;pect no man's per&s;on; but this
<PB N="240" REF="027217_0238_0FD3E3F632ABAE00">
doctrine &s;uppo&s;es that the divine Being re&s;pects per&s;ons him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Various are tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture which might be educed, that bear a plain and obvious meaning, in oppo&s;ition to this doctrine. And, though there may be &s;ome figurative pa&s;&s;ages of a doubtful tendency, in which the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;umes a borrowed &s;tyle in his way of arguing with the Jews, yet I can never agree to explain plain pa&s;|&s;ages by bold figures. We are abundantly in|&s;tructed that he willeth not the death of a &s;inner, but rather that he &s;hould be turned, and live: that he &s;hould repent, and be &s;aved with an ever|la&s;ting &s;alvation. We are al&s;o in&s;tructed, that, to them who &s;eek for glory, honour, and immor|tality, God will render eternal life; but, unto them who obey not the truth, but obey unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>tribulation and angui&s;h, indignation and wrath, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew fir&s;t, and also of the Gentile;</HI> for, there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons with God.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, impre&s;&s;ed with what I conceive are worthy notions of the Supreme Be|ing, walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we have been called. The power of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us is gone forth from &s;ea to &s;ea, from the
<PB N="241" REF="027217_0239_0FD3E3F6378F53E0">
rivers to the ends of the earth. The call of in|finite mercy and goodne&s;s is extended to people of all names and all nations, to bring them into a &s;tate of moral rectitude, to qualify them for the &s;ociety of the wi&s;e and worthy upon earth, and for the everla&s;ting communion of the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect in heaven: for this end is the go&s;pel preached to every creature under heav|en. I wi&s;h that it may be remembered with the &s;olemnity with which it ought to be remember|ed, that it is not any &s;y&s;tem of faith, it is not any profe&s;&s;ion of the purity of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, it is not the acknowledgement of his mi&s;&s;ion, it is not a &s;peaking mo&s;t honour|ably of his adorable character, of his mini&s;try, of his crucifixion, of his re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen|&s;ion into glory, nor of the propitiatory &s;acrifice which he made for the whole world, that can render us acceptable to the Father of &s;pirits: the ground of our acceptance with God is upon the &s;ame univer&s;al principle of righteou&s;ne&s;s delivered by God in his remon&s;trance with Cain: <HI>Why art thou wroth, and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doe&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted? and, if thou doe&s;t not well, &s;in lieth at the door.</HI> He was overcome by the power of, perhaps, one of the

ba&s;e&s;t pa&s;&s;ions the humam heart is capable of. He was excited to de&s;troy his brother, becau&s;e he found that his offering was accepted, that he had tokens of the divine approbation. He was excited to &s;lay him. The pa&s;&s;ion of envy excit|ed him to &s;hed human blood on the earth. With this Cain, this murderer, the Author of the univer&s;e deigns to expo&s;tulate in a very fa|miliar manner: <HI>Why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doe&s;t well, &s;halt not thou be accepted? but, if thou doe&s;t not well, &s;in lieth at the door:</HI> &s;o that, though, with re&s;pect to external profe&s;&s;ion, and the external mode of offering their &s;acrifices, they might be alike, yet, as the &s;tate of the heart of one was wicked, and productive of wicked ac|tions, he was not accepted with his gift at the &s;acred altar; whereas, righteous Abel, who not only lifted up his hands to the habitation of God's holine&s;s, and conformed to the outward &s;acrifice, but was ju&s;tly impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of his duty, became the object of the divine compla|cency: becau&s;e <HI>thou ha&s;t loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladne&s;s above thy fel|lows.</HI> Though this, perhaps, may have a peculiar relation, as &s;ome have con&s;idered it, to the Me&s;|&s;iah,
<PB N="243" REF="027217_0241_0FD3E3FA68995B38">
yet it &s;eems al&s;o to have a relation to a di&s;|crimination among creatures,&mdash;<HI>becau&s;e thou ha&s;t loved righteousness;</HI> therefore,&mdash;it is not in con|&s;equence of a &s;pecious profe&s;&s;ion, not becau&s;e of an irrevocable decree,&mdash;but, <HI>because thou ha&s;t loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy God, hath annointed the with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</HI> Oh! that there may be a pro|per emulation in us to excel in doing well. Cea&s;e, therefore, to do evil, learn to do well. As doing evil was the means of bringing down judgments upon the people of the Jews, &s;o they were in&s;tructed how to avert the divine wrath, and render them&s;elves acceptable to the Father of the univer&s;e: not by an attendance to the rituals of that di&s;pen&s;ation,&mdash;<HI>Bring no more vain obla|tions: incense is an abomination unto me,</HI> &s;aith the Lord: <HI>your new moons and your appointed fea&s;ts my soul hateth:</HI> but they were in&s;tructed what to do: <HI>Wa&s;h ye, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment; relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</HI> Here is a catalogue of excellent moral duties, here is an explanation of what it is to do well. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee,</HI> O <HI>man, what is good, and what doth the

Now,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>come, and let us reason together: though your &s;ins be as scarlet, they &s;hall be as white as snow: though they be red like crimson, they &s;hall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the land.</HI> Let us therefore conform our&s;elves to the terms by which we are to be accepted. <HI>Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but, in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted of him.</HI> Let us therefore cheri&s;h in our brea&s;ts, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the emotions of filial fear, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed from that &s;lavi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion of which man is the object. Such a fear is evidently to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from that affection we have to the Ancient of days. I compare that to the fear which an affectionate child has of its parent, which &s;prings from love; which, indeed, is the be&s;t and mo&s;t worthy mo|tive of our duties: we, therefore, fear not the Almighty Being, merely becau&s;e he is armed with an untroulable power, and able to con&s;ign us to eternal woe, who rides upon a cherub, and the clouds are the du&s;t of his feet, and doeth what|&s;oever he plea&s;eth:&mdash;we fear him not only becau&s;e of the attributes of power, but of goodne&s;s, the
<PB N="245" REF="027217_0243_0FD3E3FD93D5F120">
adorable attributes of goodne&s;s, mercy and truth. He has dealt with us not in a way of rigid ju&s;|tice, but according to the compa&s;&s;ion of a father. He has bowed the heavens, and manife&s;ted him|&s;elf among his creatures: for, he &s;o loved the world, that he &s;ent his only begotten Son into the world, that whom&s;oever believeth in him, might not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life; therefore, let him be the object of our fear; and this fear, many excellent things are &s;poken as to its effects, by way of prevention. It is a foun|tain of life, to pre&s;erve from the &s;nare of death: the fear of the Lord keepeth the heart clean; therefore, <HI>blessed is the man that feareth always.</HI> And indeed, it is the fir&s;t part of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel that was preached by an angel flying in the mid&s;t of heaven, having the everla&s;ting go&s;|pel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, &s;aying, with a loud voice, <HI>Fear God, and give glory to him; for, the hour of his judgment is come; and wor&s;hip him that made heaven and earth and the &s;ea, and the fountains of waters: fear ye him!</HI> This principle of filial fear will incline our ears to an attention to his law, and we &s;hall be meditators therein day and night;
<PB N="246" REF="027217_0244_0FD3E3FF289213F0">
and &s;hall not only be hearers of the word, but doers of it. Under the influence of this fear, we &s;hall work the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the fruit of which is peace and a&s;&s;urance forever.</P>
<P>If we ob&s;erve this rule of right, if we conform our&s;elves to him, we &s;hall be united to the Au|thor of our being in an union that is indi&s;&s;olu|ble and firm as the everla&s;ting hills. <HI>Keep my com|mandments</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t to his di&s;ciples) <HI>and abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's command|ments, and abide in his love.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that keeps the commandments of God: he &s;hall have acce&s;s to the tree of life, and enter through the gates into the city, become a citizen with the &s;aints, and of the hou&s;ehold of God.
