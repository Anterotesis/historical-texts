<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the TRIAL OF <HI>JOSEPH ANDREWS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON Wedne&s;day the 17th of May, 1769, by Virtue of a &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion from his Maje&s;ty, for the Trial of Piracy, &amp;c. at the Hall of the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> was held a Court of Admiralty, con&s;i&s;ting of the following Gentlemen, viz. His Excellency the Governor Sir <HI>Henry Moore,</HI> Pre&s;ident; ten Gentlemen of his Maje&s;ty's Council, the Judge of the Admiralty, the Deputy-Secretary, the Receiver General and Collector of the Province, and the Commander of his Ma|je&s;ty's Ship <HI>Deal Ca&s;tle,</HI></P>
<P><HI>JOSEPH ANDREWS,</HI> late of the Sloop Polly, Mari|ner, was brought to the BAR.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Nicholls, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> Regi&s;ter of the Court of Vice-Admi|ralty, and <HI>John M'Ki&s;&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> Deputy-Regi&s;ter; and a Notary Public, exhabitted five &s;everal Charges again&s;t the Pri&s;oner; fourteen Witne&s;&s;es were, examined on the Part of the Crown, and two on the Part of the Pri&s;oner. It appeared by the Evi|dence, that in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1766, he enter'd him&s;elf on board the Sloop <HI>Polly, Roluff Duryee,</HI> Ma&s;ter, bound from <HI>New-York</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> The other Per&s;ons on board were <HI>Peter Demilt, jun.</HI> Mate; <HI>Nicholas John&s;on,</HI> and <HI>William Harris,</HI> Ma|riners,&mdash;<HI>Cobbs,</HI> a Cabin Boy, <HI>Wells Coverley,</HI> a young Man; <HI>John Van Bun&s;chooten,</HI> another young Man, who went for his Health; and an <HI>Antigua</HI> Captain who had &s;old his Ve&s;&s;el, and

was returning home, Pa&s;&s;enger. Soon after leaving <HI>New-York,</HI> ob&s;erving the Captain and Pa&s;&s;engers had a good deal of Money, he and John&s;on formed the De&s;ign of gaining Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by Murdering the People. This De&s;ign they concluded to put in Execution as &s;oon as they &s;hould make the Land; accordingly about 8 Days after, the Night before they expected to get to St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> about Midnight, <HI>William Harris</HI> being at Helm, and the Captain a&s;leep on a Hencoop on Deck, <HI>John&s;on</HI> with one Blow of an Ax killed him, and he expired without a Groan or Struggle. They then in like manner between them Murdered the three Pa&s;&s;engers, and Mate with the Ax, and threw the Boy overboard alive. One of them made a Stroke with the Ax at <HI>Harris,</HI> who ran to the end of the Bolt&s;prit with a Knife, and declared he would Kill the fir&s;t Man that approached him. They then told him, if he would join them and &s;wear to be &s;ecret and faithful, he &s;hould be &s;afe, and &s;hare the Plunder with them; for <HI>John&s;on</HI> having formerly &s;ail'd with him, pretended to have a Regard for him: But it was previou&s;ly agreed between <HI>John&s;on</HI> and <HI>Andrews,</HI> to kill him before they got a&s;hore. <HI>Harris</HI> then came into the Ve&s;&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in throwing the Bodies over|board; after which they broke open the Captain's and Pa&s;&s;engers Che&s;ts and Lockers, got a Bottle of Wine, and drank Damnation to them&s;elves and each other if they di&s;covered the Secret. They then got a Bible and made <HI>Harris</HI> &s;wear upon it that he would not betray them; 3 or 4 Days after this, being in Sight of Land, and &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els appearing, they got out the Boat, put into it two Che&s;ts, with whatever they thought proper to take, &s;cut|tled the Ve&s;&s;el, left her, and &s;ail'd towards the Land, telling <HI>Harris</HI> to &s;teer clear of the Shore. But he telling them, if they did not get pretty near the Land, the Current would drive them to the Leeward of all the I&s;lands, they left him to &s;teer as he thought be&s;t,&mdash;but intended to throw him overboard before he got to Land. After &s;ome Time, <HI>John&s;on</HI> and <HI>Andrews</HI> both fell a&s;leep, when <HI>Harris,</HI> having got near the Shore, &s;tripped him&s;elf, took the Opportuaity to throw overboard, without Noi&s;e, his Clothes, and both the Oars, one of which he had u&s;ed in&s;tead of a Rudder to &s;teer the Boat, he gently let him&s;elf down into the Sea and &s;wam on Shore at St. Kitts. where he gave a blind &s;u&s;|picious Account of him&s;elf, being afraid to &s;ay any Thing that might break his Oath of Secrecy; but at la&s;t he applied to a Mini&s;ter for Advice how a Man ouht to act in a Ca&s;e &s;imilar to his own. The Mini&s;ter convinced him that &s;uch kind of Oaths were
<PB N="5" REF="011149_0004_0F856A14348BBC88">
&s;o far from being binding, that it would be highly criminal to keep them He then went before the Judge <HI>Surrogate</HI> of the Admi|ralty and gave his Depo&s;ition of all the Circum&s;tances he knew of the bloody Affair. Soon after he quitted the Boat, the irregular tumbling of it waked the two Criminals, who &s;aw their de&s;perate Situation, and were enraged they had not an Opportunity to &s;a|tiate their Revenge upon <HI>Harris.</HI> They at fir&s;t endeavour'd to &s;teer with their Hats, but afterwards did it more effectually with their Sprit, and by that Means got to Eu&s;tatia, where they &s;old the Boat.</P>
<P>Some Days after their Arrival, the St. <HI>Chri&s;topher's</HI> Gazette with <HI>Harris's</HI> Depo&s;ition, made its Appearance in Eu&s;tatia; <HI>An|drews</HI> happening to &s;ee it, immediately left the I&s;land, in a Ve&s;|&s;el bound to <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay.</HI> The Governor of St. <HI>Eu&s;tatia</HI>; on &s;ee|ing the Depo&s;ition, publi&s;hed by Proclamation an Order for a deligent Search, and that no Per&s;on &s;hould carry the Criminals off, under the Penalty of 50,000 Pieces of Eight: He al&s;o di&s;|patched a Ve&s;&s;el after <HI>Andrews,</HI> with a proper Notification of the Charge again&s;t him, and De&s;cription of his Per&s;on. <HI>John&s;on</HI> was &s;oon taken up at <HI>Eu&s;tatia,</HI> confe&s;&s;ed the Fact, and was executed on the 15th of <HI>November,</HI> 1766, by being broke alive on the Rack: He was &s;tretched naked on a Cro&s;s, where the Bones of his Arms, Legs and Thighs were broken with an Iron Bar, and he afterwards received upwards 20 Strokes on his brea&s;t, before he expired. <HI>Andrews</HI> the pre&s;ent Criminal was &s;oon after his Arrival taken up, and impri&s;oned &s;ome Time at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> when he attempted to cut his own Throat, but was prevented by the Care of his Attendants. From <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> he was &s;ent here, where he ar|rived the Twenty-&s;ixth Day of <HI>May,</HI> 1767, and remained a Pri|&s;oner till his Execution.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Part of the clothing found with the Pri&s;oner in his Che&s;t, and by him claimed as his own, in the Pre&s;ence of the Court, were very fully and circum&s;tantially proved to have belonged to Captain <HI>Duryee,</HI> and his Mate, or &s;ome of the Per|&s;ons who were Murdered on board the &s;aid Sloop; and al&s;o many other Things found in the Che&s;t and owned by the Pri&s;oner.&mdash; Many of the Clothes were marked with the initial Letters of the Names of their former Owners, and many others of them with the plain Marks of tho&s;e Letters remaining, tho' the Silk of the marking was taken out, and they were marked J. A. the initial Letters of the Name of the Pri&s;oner&punc; a Needle work'd Pocket-Book found with, and own'd by the Pri&s;oner, before it
<PB N="6" REF="011149_0005_0F856A181D6F3F70">
was &s;hewn in Court, was exactly de&s;cribed by the Woman who made it, particularly that a Corner of it was left unfini&s;hed for want of Wor&s;ted to do it it; likewi&s;e a Medal of which the Bro|ther of one of the Murder'd Per&s;ons, had a Copy, Several things &s;aid by the Pri&s;oner, during the Cour&s;e of the Trial, and in his Defence, militated much again&s;t him. The Trial la&s;ted from Ten o'Clock on Wedne&s;day, until One o'clock on Thur&s;day Morning, during all which Time his Excellency never left the Bench. The Evidence was full, clear, and particular; the Pri|&s;oner was found <HI>guilty,</HI> and received Sentence of Death.</P>
<P>He was Executed on Tue&s;day the 23d of <HI>May,</HI> at the Ea&s;t-Side of <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River, near <HI>Domini's</HI> Hook, between the eb|bing and flowing of the Tide: And his Body was afterwards hung in Chains, on the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Part of the Pe&s;t or <HI>Bealow's-I&s;land,</HI> in <HI>New York Bay,</HI> as a Spectacle to deter all Per&s;ons from the like atrocious Crimes.</P>
<P>The Account he gave of him&s;elf was as follows, viz. That he was an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> born at the Town of <HI>Swanzey,</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> of poor but hone&s;t Prote&s;tant Parents, who brought him up in their own Per&s;ua&s;ion, gave him an Education &s;uitable to their Circum&s;tances, and &s;ent him to Sea: That he has led a Seafaring Life ever &s;ince, and &s;ailed to many different Parts of the World; that he had &s;ome Friends and Connections in <HI>Portugal,</HI> which led him to frequent and make &s;ome &s;tay in that Place, and learn the Language; which gave Ri&s;e to the Report, that he was a <HI>Por|tugue&s;e,</HI> and a <HI>Roman-Catholic,</HI> which was not true, as he never profe&s;&s;ed any other than the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion.</HI></P>
<P>For many Years pa&s;t he has made the City of <HI>New-Fork</HI> (where he married and has left a Widow) the place of his Re&s;idence, when not at Sea.&mdash;His Behaviour on Shore was irregular and di&s;orderly.</P>
<P>A Neglect of Religion and all Chri&s;tian Duties, and a free In|dulgence of every vicious Inclination, particulatly in keeping bad Company, led him from one degree of Wickedne&s;s to an|other, till his Heart was hardened again&s;t Remor&s;e and became capable of harbouring and devi&s;ing horrid Thoughts and De|&s;igns. The re&s;training Influences of the Divine Spirit, &s;o often &s;lighted and abu&s;ed, were withdrawn from him, and he was left to be governed by the furious Impul&s;es of his di&s;orderly Pa&s;&s;ions, and to pur&s;ue with Greedine&s;s the De&s;ires of his own wicked Heart. The Gratification of the&s;e De&s;ires was the Temptation
<PB N="7" REF="011149_0006_0F856A18E9A489A8">
that lead him to covet the Money of the Captain and Pa&s;&s;engers, which he hoped would furni&s;h him with the Means; and when that Thought had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Brea&s;t he was determin|ed to remove every Ob&s;tacle to its Accompli&s;hment, however dreadful the Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Minds mu&s;t have been mo&s;t amazingly hardened in Guilt, that could in cool Blood have been &s;o long brooding over &s;uch a horrible Purpo&s;e, and Per&s;i&s;t in it till its final Execution. This cau&s;ed a Su&s;picion that Men capable of a Fact like this, mu&s;t have been Veterans in Blood and Murder, and could not for a fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay, have been Actors in &s;o dreadful a Scene of Slaughter.</P>
<P>And therefore the&s;e Criminals were &s;u&s;pected to be the Au|thors of &s;everal other Murders perpretated within the&s;e few Years, particularly of <HI>Anthony De Noyer,</HI> Ma&s;ter of a <HI>French</HI> Schooner, near the I&s;land of <HI>St. Domingo</HI>; in the Year 1765, and of two Men in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI>; but they both, till their la&s;t Moments, per|&s;i&s;ted in &s;olemnly denying that they had ever before been con|cerned in any Murder or other capital Crime.</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;eph Andrews,</HI> was remarkably ignorant or in&s;en&s;ible in Mat|ters of religious or moral Obligation; and though he &s;eem'd hear|tily to feel the Horrot of his Situation; yet all his Di&s;tre&s;s &s;eem'd to ari&s;e from the Dread of per&s;onal Puni&s;hment&mdash;not at all from a proper Sen&s;e of his Guilt; and though he confe&s;&s;ed the Fact for which he &s;uffered, repeatedly, to both the Mini&s;ters, and at the Gallows, yee he always &s;eemed to own it with Reluctance; and to feel &s;omething of Re&s;entment again&s;t the Witne&s;&s;es upon who&s;e Evidence he was found guilty, but &s;aid he forgave them.</P>
<P>The Excu&s;e he made for throwing the Boy overboard, was, that in the Scuffle he had received a Wound, which he appre|hended would have been Mortal, and that therefore it was be&s;t to end his Mi&s;ery at once.</P>
<P>At the Gallows he owned his Crime, de&s;ired all People, e&s;pe|cially Sailors to take Warning by him, and after repeating the Creed and Lord's Prayer, was executed.</P>
<P>THE Night preceeding ANDREWS's Execution, a Gentleman who&s;e veracity can be depended upon, went up to the Room wherein he was confined in the New-Goal, and had a very &s;erious conver&s;ation with him. And after having joined him in Prayer; he advi&s;ed him to &s;atisfy the Public, by confe&s;&s;ing the Crimes he had been guilty of &mdash;Andrews mu&s;ed for &s;ome Time, and then gave the following declaration.&mdash;As a dying Man, I think it is
<PB N="8" REF="011149_0007_0F856A19AA0873C8">
a duty I owe to my&s;elf, to &s;ay &s;omething again&s;t the many Crimes laid to my Charge by &s;ome Per&s;ons, as a clamourous and in&s;olent, as they are ignorant and &s;tupid; for if you take the Voice of the People, in general, there never was a Crime committed by mankind but what has been imput|ed to me. I pray God to forgive them and they have both my Forgivene&s;s and Pity: My name is Jo&s;eph Ander&s;on: I was born in Swanzey, in the Southern Part of Wales, near Vaux-Hall, of poor but hone&s;t Parents&mdash;in my Youth, I came over an Indented Servant to Bo&s;ton, and &s;erved part of an Apprenti&s;hip to a Capt. of a Ve&s;&s;el; but being very ambitious to be my own Ma&s;ter, I de&s;erted from him when at Li&s;bon.&mdash;I always had an in&s;atiable de&s;ire for Money, and this unhappy propen&s;ity has prompted me to do things, the remembrance of which is now very grievous unto me; but who liveth and &s;inneth not! And tho&s;e who rail mo&s;t again&s;t me, if they will take the trouble of &s;crutinizing their own Lives, they will find their conduct has not been unex|ceptionable.&mdash;However they may &s;ay of me what they plea&s;e, as my Time here, in all probability is very &s;hort &mdash;And after the Execution of my Sentence, when they&punc; &s;ee my Body Hanging in Chains, they may (as they no doubt will) &s;ay there Hangs the Body of ANDREWS, the Pirate, who being a Roman Catholick, would make no Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was then Silent for a &s;hort Time, and upon the Gentleman's A&s;king him whether he was a Roman Catho|lic or not, he An&s;wered in the Negative. And added that he had lived and &s;hould die a Member of the Church of England. He was very de&s;irous to know if his Body <HI>realy</HI> was to be hung in Chains, if not, he would give a particular account of the Tran&s;actions of his Life; but if on the con|trary, they per&s;i&s;ted in their re&s;olution to Hang him in Chains, the World &s;hould have little Satisfaction from him. &mdash;His Behaviour at the Place of Execution was decent and re&s;igned, he Prayed about fifteen Minutes and then de&s;ired the cart to be drove of.&mdash;Upon the whole he &s;eemed to be a daring re&s;olute Fellow.</P>
