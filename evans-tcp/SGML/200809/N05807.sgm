<P>THE awful and unu&s;ual Providence of GOD in the Week pa&s;t, in which he has vi&s;ited us with a remarkable Earthquake, has been the Occa&s;ion of my &s;electing the Words before us, for our Meditation at this Time. If we &s;hould neglect to take a proper Notice, or to make a &s;uitable Improvement of an Event of this Kind, we &s;hould undoubtedly act again&s;t the Light of Nature, the fir&s;t Principles, and mo&s;t evident Dictates of Rea&s;on. Even the&s;e could teach <HI>Jonah'</HI>s Mariners in a Tempe&s;t, every one to ari&s;e &amp; call upon his God: tho' they were Heathen, unenlightned by Revela|tion, Strangers to the Covenant of Promi&s;e, and
<PB N="2" REF="007375_0004_102B8BEE2CF58198">
Aliens from the Common-Wealth of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> They who dwell in the uttermo&s;t Parts of the Earth are afraid of his Tokens. Certainly therefore our Guilt and Puni&s;hment would be enhanced and aggravated, if we &s;hould omit this natural Duty in a Ca&s;e of equal Di&s;tre&s;s and Danger; if we &s;hould incur the Character of tho&s;e who regard not the Works of the Lord, neither con&s;ider the Operation of his Hands. We call our &s;elves Chri&s;tians, we profe&s;s the true Religion, and enjoy the Means of Grace, the Oracles and Ordinances of God in their utmo&s;t Purity and Perfection: It may ju&s;tly therefore be expected that we &s;hould do more than others who are not favour'd with the like Advantages, that we &s;hould be more &s;erious and circum|&s;pect in our Behaviour on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; more frequent and fervent in our Addre&s;&s;es at the Throne of Grace, more careful and critical in our Enquiries into the Grounds of the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, and wherefore our God is thus con|tending with us.</P>
<P>The God of Patience is yet waiting to be gracious; He is loth to &s;trike the fatal Blow, to overwhelm us in univer&s;al and unavoidable De&s;truction. He has Tho'ts of Pity towards us; his Heart is turned within him, his Re|pentings are kindled together: How &s;hall I give thee up <HI>Ephraim?</HI> How &s;hall I deliver thee <HI>I&s;rael?</HI> How &s;hall I make thee as <HI>Admah?</HI> How &s;hall I &s;et thee as <HI>Zeboim?</HI> We may yet be reconciled to him in and thro' our Lord
<PB N="3" REF="007375_0005_102B8BF01317C970">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great and only Mediator: But if thus having Space to repent, we yet repent not, we &s;hall find that it is a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God. If we de&s;|pi&s;e the Riches of Divine Goodne&s;s, Forbear|ance &amp; Long-&s;uffering; there will be nothing before us but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation, which &s;hall devour the Adver&s;aries. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. He will again vi&s;it us with an Earthquake, or with &s;ome other de&s;olating Judgment; He has other Judgments in Store, other Arrows in his Quiver: And verily, it will then be more tolerable for <HI>Tyre</HI> &amp; <HI>Sidon,</HI> for <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorrah</HI> than for us. After our hard and impenitent Heart, we &s;hall trea&s;ure up Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and the Re|velation of the righteous Judgment of God. <Q>At his Wrath the Earth &s;hall tremble, and the Nations &s;hall not be able to abide his Indig|nation.</Q></P>
<P>In handling the Words, I propo&s;e to con&s;i|der two Propo&s;itions which are evidently im|plied in them, and which may make Way for the Enquiry, What Improvement we are to make of the awful Providence in the Week pa&s;t.&mdash;<HI>At his Wrath the Earth &s;hall tremble.</HI>&mdash;This teaches us that an Earthquake is a Work of Almighty Power, and a Token of Divine Anger.</P>
<P>I. An Earthquake is a Work of Almighty Power.</P>

No Doubt natural Cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;igned for this <HI>Phaenomenon.</HI> An impri&s;oned Vapour too clo&s;ely pent, or too &s;trongly compre&s;&s;ed in the Caverns beneath, will, thro' a natural Ela&s;ti|city, abhor Confinement, dilate and expand, &s;well and heave up the Surface of the Earth, producing a Tremor and Commotion, till it either finds Vent, or, from &s;ome other Cau&s;e, it is &s;mothered, and its Violence abated. Could we look into the Vaults below, over which we now walk without Fear, and in &s;o much &s;eeming Security, to &s;ee the tremendous <HI>Apparatus</HI> there: in &s;ome Places, immen&s;e Tracts of Sulphureous and Combu&s;tible Materials that lie buried, and wait for Nothing but a &s;ingle Spark to tear all before them in a &s;udden and irre&s;i&s;table Explo|&s;ion; In others, how thin the Arch which in|terpo&s;es between us and a Furnace of Flame, which curls up again&s;t it, wa&s;ts it away, cau&s;es it to grow thinner and thinner, and le&s;s able to &s;upport us: Should we not &s;hudder at &s;uch a Pro&s;pect, when the Imagination of it fills us with &s;o much Horror and Amazement! And yet this is very probably the State &amp; Condition of our Globe at pre&s;ent. It has a natural Ten|dency to a final Conflagration. It is kept in Store and re&s;erved unto Fire again&s;t the Day of Judgment and Perdition of ungodly Men. And that &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition of Things which fits it for this Cata&s;trophe, renders it al&s;o liable to Earthquakes.</P>

But we mu&s;t not imagine from hence, that an Earthquake, becau&s;e it may be accounted for on Philo&s;ophical Principles, is a ca&s;ual Event, or that &s;ome Chance has happened unto us. It is God at Work, tho' he works by the Inter|vention of &s;econd Cau&s;es. Tho' it is no Mi|racle, it is the Effect of Almighty Power: This is frequently declared in the &s;acred Pages: Nay this is taken for granted in the Context as an indi&s;putable Point; and <HI>Jehovah</HI> proves him&s;elf to be the only true God, in Oppo&s;ition to all the Idols of the Heathen, from this very Argu|ment, <Q>The Lord is the true God; He is the living God, and an everla&s;ting King; at his Wrath the Earth &s;hall tremble, and the Nati|ons &s;hall not be able to abide his Indignation.</Q></P>
<P>How often do we find this wonderful and terrible Work a&s;cribed to God in the holy Scriptures? He looketh on the Earth and it trembleth; He toucheth the Hills and they &s;moke. At his Command a Vulcanoe is lit up to the univer&s;al Terror and Con&s;ternation of the guilty Inhabitants round it. Deep groans the affrighted Earth, at his Pre&s;ence; and the awful Sound is reverberated from Cavern to Cavern thro' all its mo&s;t intricate, gloomy and profound Rece&s;&s;es. The whole Continent &s;hivers &amp; quakes to its remote&s;t Foundations; the Pillars of Heaven tremble and are a&s;toni&s;h'd at his Reproof.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxix. 8.</NOTE> <Q>The Voice of the Lord &s;ha|keth the Wilderne&s;s, the Lord &s;haketh the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Kade&s;h.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xcvii. 4.</NOTE> The Voice of thy

<P>When the glorious God has, upon particular Occa&s;ions, made a miraculous De&s;cent upon our Earth, he has frequently been attended with an Earthquake, as one of the Tokens of his &s;pecial Pre&s;ence.

<P>This may &s;uffice to illu&s;trate the fir&s;t Thing propo&s;ed, That an Earthquake, tho' it may be ac|counted for on natural Principles, is notwith|&s;tanding the Work of Almighty Power.

<Q>of the Cities, and that which grew upon the Ground.</Q> This was the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Korah, Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> when they laid an impious Claim to the Employment, the Honors and the Privileges of the Prie&s;thood, which God had confined to the Family of <HI>Aaron.</HI> The Anger of God was kindled again&s;t them for their pre&s;umptuous and &s;acrilegious Attempt. At his Wrath the Earth trembled, and the bold Con&s;pirators were hurled headlong, plunged promi&s;cuous and precipitant into the hideous Vaults below. Down they &s;unk, as they were in the very Act to &s;acrifice, and in&s;olently with|&s;tood <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the View &amp; at the Head of the Rebel Congregation.

<P>Upon the whole then, it evidently appears from what we have heard, that an Earthquake is not only an Effect of Almighty Power, but a Token of Divine Anger.
