<HEAD>A Prefatory Epi&s;tle TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is no rare or uncommon Thing, that religions Di&s;putes &s;pend them&s;elves on meer <HI>Circum&s;tantials</HI>; Things, that 'tis of little Im|portance, on which Side of the Que&s;tion, the Truth is found, as to them, And for that Rea&s;on they are often pa&s;s'd over by wi&s;e Men, as not worthy of any clo&s;e Attention or warm Debate. But the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e in the Controver&s;y now before us; the Subject whereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any light Matter, or bare Circum&s;tantial of Chri&s;tianity: But 'tis one of the great <HI>Things</HI> of the Go&s;pel; nothing le&s;s than wherein the Nature and Extent of the <HI>Go&s;pel it &s;elf,</HI> and <HI>New Covenant,</HI> therein revealed, con&s;i&s;ts.&mdash; So that on what Side of this Debate, the <HI>Truth</HI> lies, there lies the <HI>Co|venant</HI> of Grace, and real Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: But, on the other Side lies <HI>an|other Covenant,</HI> and <HI>another Go&s;pel,</HI> as to this Particular, a Covenant of <HI>Man's</HI> own devi&s;ing, a Go&s;pel &s;uch as <HI>Divine</HI> Revelation knows nothing of.</P>
<P>We, on the one Hand, readily own, that the <HI>New Covenant</HI> prom&s;is <HI>eternal Life</HI> to <HI>un&s;eigned Faith, Repentance, Love,</HI> &amp;c. And in a Word, to all <HI>Obedi|ence</HI> thence ari&s;ing; which in a Go&s;pel-Sen&s;e is termed, <HI>Good Works, Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. But then (as is ob&s;erved in the following Papers) we are expre&s;ly taught by the Holy Gho&s;t, that none &s;uch car be performed by us, <HI>previous</HI> to our Regeneration.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is readily acknowledged by us, that the <HI>Encouragement</HI> given to all, to whom the Go&s;pel is publi&s;h'd, to labour after a &s;aving Compliance therewith, is great; and &s;uch as by an infinite Wi&s;dom is &s;ated to the State of the fallen Crea|ture: But &s;till, &s;hort of a <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> a&s;certaining the Succe&s;s of his Endeavours

&s;o as that, whenever <HI>fir&s;t Grace,</HI> or &s;aving Conver&s;ion, is be&s;towed, it &s;hould be in the Way of GOD's performing a <HI>Covenant Obligation,</HI> he had graciou&s;ly la&s;t him|&s;elf under, on Condition of any Seekings, Strivings, of Doings of the Sinner.</P>
<P>What Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ad tho&s;e with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther Side, advance, is, That GOD has graciou&s;ly <HI>obliged</HI> him&s;elf in the New Covenant, not only is be&s;tow eternal Life on the &s;incerity Penitent, or Godly (as above) but al&s;o is be&s;tow his <HI>&s;pecial, ef|fectual Grace</HI> on the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Condition of certain Endeavour put forth by them, whil&s;t under the Deminion and Guilt of Sin &mdash; So that the Controver&s;y here plainly re&s;pects the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>New Covenant.</HI>&mdash;'Tis there|fore of the &s;ame Importance, that we rightly under&s;tand what Truth is in this P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as that we rightly under&s;tand what the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> is&mdash; Nor is it po&s;&s;ible the Sinner &s;hould know in what <HI>Form</HI> or <HI>Manner</HI> be may hope &s;ucce&s;sfully to addre&s;s the Divine Maje&s;ty by Prayer for the Be&s;towment of <HI>&s;pecial Grace,</HI> but by rightly under&s;tanding the Nature and Extern of the New Covenant, in regard of this Particular. &mdash; For if <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> be given only in Pur&s;uance of a <HI>Cove|nant Engagement,</HI> or in the Way of perfoming &s;ome <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of GOD, made to certain Doings of the unconverted Sinner, then doubtle&s;s it mu&s;t be a very <HI>wrong</HI> Method for the Sinner to &s;eek it otherwi&s;e, then in the Way of <HI>Covenant Right,</HI> or <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">,</HI> by having performed tho&s;e Things to which it is gracious promi&s;ed: Be|cau&s;e that would be to &s;eek it out of GOD's covenanted Way of be&s;towing of it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on the other Hand, if it be given meerly in the Way of <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> and not at all, in the Way of GOD's performing any gracious Promi&s;e of his, made to the Doings of the Sinner, then it mu&s;t be very wrong for the Sinner to &s;eek it as a Ble&s;&s;ing <HI>promi&s;'d</HI> him, to which he has or may have a <HI>Covenant-Right</HI> by any Doings of his, in his unregenerate State: Becau&s;e that would be to &s;eek it in an. <HI>An <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">criptural</HI> Way, a Way in which GOD hath never by any Engagement of his given him the lea&s;t Encouragement to expect the Be&s;towment to it.&mdash;And if this latter be the Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t then certainly follow, that all Pre&s;ence of <HI>preaching the Go|&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> under this Head of urging Sinners upon &s;eeking after renewing Grace as <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to their own Doings, is &s;o far from preaching the true Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as that 'tis in Reality a <HI>perverting the Go&s;pel,</HI> or preaching con|trary to it: And is &s;o much wor&s;e to than nothing, in this Particular, as the Tra|veller's being directed to a wrong Road, is wor&s;e than no Direction at all; be|cau&s;e, that, in&s;tead of forwarding his Journey, at lea&s;t greatly retards it.</P>
<P>To &s;peak plainly here, &s;uch is the Tenor of the New Covenant, according to the Doctor (if I under&s;tand him at all) that the <HI>Sinner,</HI> which receives the <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> of GOD for the Renovation of his Nature to Holine&s;s, receives it as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th Way of <HI>Covenant Right,</HI> by his Works, whil&s;t Unregenerate, as the <HI>Saint</HI> in Chri&s;t Je&s;us receives the Reward of future Glory by a <HI>Covenant Right,</HI> ari&s;ing from a Compliance with Go&s;pel-Terms.</P>
<P>Such a <HI>Scheme</HI> of the Covenant as this (I acknowledge) I have never yet been all to &s;ee in the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> &mdash; And therefore, I have endeavoured in the following Sheets (after what has been thought &s;ufficient, is replaced to the <HI>Doctor's</HI> Letter) to evidence from various Arguments, that this Notion of the New Covenant is merely humane, what neither is, nor can be divine, according to the Revelation, which GOD) has given us of his Mind and Will.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected, that I make &s;ome Apology for my publi&s;hing this Reply to the <HI>Doctor's Letter,</HI> as it appears now <HI>out of Seaten</HI>; not only becau&s;e, it is
<PB REF="006010_0005_10277111EE9C6F20">
&s;ome Time &s;ince his Letter came abroad; but e&s;pecially becau&s;e it hath already received a &s;ufficient An&s;wer from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on;</HI> after which it may be thought, nothing further can be needful.&mdash;</P>
<P>I would &s;ay them, 1&s;t. That when I entered upon this Affair, it was with a View, that the <HI>Dr</HI>'s Letter was not like to receive any An&s;wer at all. &mdash; And therefore, though I knew my &s;elf one of the lea&s;t among my Brethren, and by no Means able to give the Cau&s;e that fall Advantage, which Truth would allow: Yet taking of to be the Cau&s;e of GOD, and of common Concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, I was willing to do my Part in the Defence of it; even as the lea&s;t of the King's Subjects ought not to &s;tand by and &s;ee the Intere&s;t of his Prince &s;uffer, without attempting what is in his Power to defend it. Thus was I induced to make the pre&s;ent Attempt.&mdash;And,</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> Though the Sufficiency of Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI>'s Reply be fully conceeded, as to be &s;ure it is by me; Neverthele&s;s, doubtle&s;s, this will be allowed by all, that how|ever well Error is demon&s;trated again&s;t, and Truth vindicated by one, yet &s;till the &s;ane Thing being done by another Hand in a <HI>different</HI> Manner, tends to Confirma|tion: And u&s;ually carries this Advantage with it, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;ome who did not &s;o clearly &s;ee Truth in the former Repre&s;entation, will more clearly di&s;cern it in the latter: And that, even, when the latter is greatly inferior to the former; which I am &s;en&s;ible is the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; and yet I conceive it po&s;&s;ible, that even this Meanne&s;s may &s;erve the better to accomodate what is &s;aid, to the Under&s;tanding and Acceptation of the more Illiterate. Upon this View, together with their Con&s;idera|tions, I have by the Importunity of Friends, been prevailed on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that the following Sheets (which indeed for &s;ome Time have lain by) might be made publick.</P>
<P>As to the Manner of compo&s;ing, I am not in&s;en&s;ible, that the &s;ame Things with &s;ome Variation of Expre&s;&s;ion, are once and again repeated in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Places of this Performance; which though naturally di&s;ta&s;teful to the polite and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">ing Reader, will (I hope) be ea&s;ily overlook'd, &s;ince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cas out of a compa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ign thereby of accomodating Things better to the weake&s;t Under&s;tanding; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> if po&s;&s;ible, every Capacity might be reach'd with a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tion of Truth.</P>
<P>As to any Thing of Peremptorine&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion made U&s;e of by me in this De|bate, all that I would be under&s;tood thereby to &s;ignify is, that the things, in the Writing of them, to me appear'd con&s;iderably clear: Not that I expect that this Manner of Expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be of any further Influence with the Reader than the Evidence of Truth, with which it is accompanied, ju&s;tly requires.&mdash;</P>
<P>If any Thing of undue Warmth or Har&s;hne&s;s of Language rewards the Rev. Dr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> if any Thing of that Wind beyond what the Nature of the Cau&s;e, and the Defence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> required, and what Chri&s;tianity it &s;elf will vindicate, &s;hall be found in the following Debate, to have drop from my Pen, it is what I have not upon a cool Reflection been able to ob&s;erve, and &s;hall readily retract any &s;uch In&s;tance, upon being convinced hereof</P>
<P>Though I pretend not to an Exemption of what I have here wrote, from much of Weakne&s;s and humane <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; yet this, I tru&s;t, I may &s;ay with good A&s;&s;urance, that &s;o far as I am con&s;erves to my own Views and De&s;igns, I have done it for the Sake of what I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ally believe will be found at la&s;t to be <HI>divine Truth</HI>; and
<PB REF="006010_0006_10277125D5C85310">
with an Aim (&s;o far as it may plea&s;e GOD to ble&s;s my weak Endeavours) to pre|vent, at lea&s;t in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, an Inundation of (what are commonly called) <HI>Pelagian</HI> and <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors; which, to my be&s;t Ob&s;ervation, have a very threat|ning A&s;pect on the dear Churches of God in this Land, and do &s;peak their Danger of being &s;ooner or later carried off, at lea&s;t in &s;ome e&s;&s;ential Points, from the <HI>Go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t</HI> (which our Fathers valued above all their worldly Intere&s;ts, and which they brought over into this Wilderne&s;s, and left as a precious Legacy to their Po&s;|terity) even to the receiving <HI>another Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In fine,</HI> All I &s;hall reque&s;t of the Reader, is, that you would peru&s;e with Can|dour, and an unble&s;s'd Aim at Truth; compare what is here &s;aid, with the public <HI>Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith,</HI> e&s;pecially with the Articles and Homilies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but above all with the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> weighing it in the Ballance of the Sanctuary: And if in any Thing you find it contrary to GOD's Word, reject it; but &s;o far as you find it agreeable to that &s;acred Standard, receive and em|brace it. And may the Father of Lights and of Mercies guide you into a &s;aving Acquaintance with all Truth, &s;anctify you by, and e&s;tabli&s;h your Heart in the Truth, for Je&s;us Sake. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>A</HI> LETTER <HI>to the Rev. Dr.</HI> JOHNSON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING been reque&s;ted by a Friend, to make &s;uch <HI>Re|marks</HI> on that Part of your late Performance, intitled, <HI>A</HI> LETTER from <HI>Ari&s;tocles</HI> to <HI>Authades,</HI> which relates to the <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> as to me might appear nece&s;&s;ary, for the <HI>Vin|dication</HI> of &s;ome of the great and precious Truths of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI>; and having taken &s;aid <HI>Letter,</HI> in that Part, under Con&s;idera|tion, it appears to me mo&s;t unexceptionable, in a Matter of &s;o great Importance, as that of the <HI>Cau&s;e of GOD,</HI> wherein (as you acknow|ledge) <HI>the eternal Salvation of Souls is very nearly concerned,</HI> to appear open and free and as I tru&s;t, you will find me equally far from a <HI>di&s;putatious Temper,</HI> as you profe&s;s your &s;elf to be, &s;o I hope I &s;hall find my &s;elf, by your own Example, &s;ecured of a kind and candid Acceptance. Therefore I &s;hall, without any further Apology, ad|dre&s;s my &s;elf to you, Sir, in what I have to offer on this Head.</P>
<P>Now that our Readers may have a clear Under&s;tanding of this Matter, I think it proper to be noticed, that what gave Occa&s;ion to your <HI>Letter,</HI> was a <HI>Sermon</HI> publi&s;hed by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> of <HI>Stratfield,</HI> in Vindication of the <HI>Sovereignty of GOD,</HI> in the Di&s;pen&s;a|tion of his <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> to lo&s;t Sinners, on <HI>Exod.</HI> XXXiii. 18. In the Improvement of which Sermon it is inferred, <HI>That there are no Pro|mi&s;es of &s;pecial Grace made unto any Doings of the Unregenerate, by the Performance of which they might become intitied to it.</HI> Accordingly your <HI>Letter</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of two Parts; the Former on the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of GOD, the Latter on the Promi&s;es. It is the <HI>Latter,</HI> that I am here principally concerned with.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed the former Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, you introduce the latter in the following Words. Pag. 22. <HI>Indeed you was then only un|dertaking to prove, that there are no Promi&s;es in the Scripture to the Un|regenerate; [meaning by the Unregenerate, tho&s;e (whether baptized, or not) who are under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin.]</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="006010_0008_102771692FB8C430">Here, that I may proceed with the greater Clearne&s;s, I &s;hall</P>
<P>I. State the <HI>Que&s;tion.</HI></P>
<P>II. Con&s;ider what is offer'd by you to <HI>invalidate</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Arguments advanced in his <HI>Sermon,</HI> in Favour of the <HI>Nega|tive</HI> Side of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>III. Con&s;ider what you have offer'd in Confirmation of the <HI>affir|mative.</HI> And then,</P>
<P N="4">IV. Sugge&s;t a few Things to Con&s;ideration which &s;erve, among many others, to per&s;uade me, that the Truth lies on the <HI>Negative</HI> Side.</P>
<P>According to this Method, I am</P>
<P>I. To State <HI>the Que&s;tion.</HI>&mdash;Now in Order to this it may be ob|&s;erved, That the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> between Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> and you is not, <HI>Whe|ther there be any Promi&s;es in the Bible</HI>? Which you &s;eem, wildly enough, to in&s;inuate. (<HI>Page</HI> 21, 22, 23.)&mdash;Nor is it,</P>
<P>Whether there are any conditional Promi&s;es made to Sinners in the Scrip|tures?</P>
<P><HI>Neither is it,</HI> Whether it be the Sinner's indi&s;pen&s;able Duty, in the U&s;e of appointed Means, earne&s;tly to &s;eek after the Attainment of &s;pe|cial Grace?&mdash;<HI>Nor yet,</HI></P>
<P>Whether God's Be&s;towment of &s;pecial Grace upon Sinners be ordinarily in the Way of the Sinners diligent, earne&s;t, and painful Endeavours, in the U&s;e of appointed Means? <HI>Nor,</HI></P>
<P>Whether the Encouragement Sinner's have, in the Go&s;pel, to hope that Succe&s;s may attend their thus &s;eeking, be very great and precious?</P>
<P>Nor yet,</P>
<P>Whether the Sinner's Encouragement to hope for the Succe&s;s of his En|deavours, ri&s;es in Proportion to his Diligence and Painfulne&s;s in the U&s;e of appointed Means?&mdash;<HI>None of all the&s;e properly belong to the Con|trover&s;y in Hand.</HI></P>
<P>You do indeed, Sir, charge Mr. <HI>Cooke,</HI> in &s;ome of his Expre&s;&s;ions, with denying there are any <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> at all in the Scripture, <HI>Pag.</HI> 22. But yet at the &s;ame Time you are oblig'd to confe&s;s, <HI>That he was only undertaking to prove there were no Promi&s;es, in the Scripture, to the Unregenerate.</HI> So that it is evident, you did not really un|der&s;tand him to mean, what you in&s;inuate his Words &s;peak.</P>
<P>But to come directly to the Ca&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>The <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> properly now before us is, <HI>Whether there be Promi&s;es of the Be&s;towment of &s;pecial Grace, made in the Scripture to unregenerate Sinners, on Condition of any Endeavours, Strivings, or Doings of theirs what&s;oever?</HI> or, which amounts to much the &s;ame,</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006010_0009_1027717F6E91DC18">Whether God be&s;tows &s;pecial Grace on the Unregenerate, in the Way of performing a Covenant-Promi&s;e made to any Doings of theirs what&s;o|ever; allowing that Promi&s;e, both as to the Matter and Being of it, to be of Meer Grace?</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion being thus fairly &s;tated, the Bu&s;ine&s;s is brought into a narrow Compa&s;s; and had you proved either of the&s;e, both had readily been granted; But Nothing of this Nature hath hitherto been found in your <HI>Letter.</HI> You do indeed, once and again, in&s;i&s;t upon it, <HI>That in the final Retributions to be awarded to Men in the Life to come, God acts as a righteous judge of the Behaviour of his Crea|tures, and rewards or puni&s;hes according to Stipulation; and that in this grand affair ab&s;olute Sovereignty has no Place.</HI> Pag. 6, 20.&mdash;And who of us ever entertained one &s;ingle Thought to the contrary? What therefore, Sir, you would be at, in in&s;i&s;ting &s;o much on this Point, I am unable to conceive; unle&s;s you would hereby in&s;inuate to the World, that the Rev. Author of that <HI>Sermon,</HI> referr'd to in your Letter, is of a contrary Mind, and if &s;o, you had done well to pro|duce your Evidence.&mdash;Or,</P>
<P>Can it once be imagined, that becau&s;e God acts as a Judge in the final Retributions to be awarded to Men, at the Day of Judg|ment, therefore he acts as a Judge al&s;o in the Be&s;towment of effectual Grace here in this World, while in a State of Probation? Where is the Connection between the&s;e Things?

5, 6. where you tell us; <HI>In Order to think clearly on this Subject,&mdash; it &s;eems, to you, very nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Con&s;ideration of God as a Benefactor, and as a Judge: And between the Be&s;towment of various Talents and Favours upon Men in this Life, which is a State of Probation, and the Retributions to be awarded in the Life to come, accord|ing to what U&s;e they &s;hall have made of them here. In the one</HI> (i.e. in the Be&s;towment of various Talents and Favours upon Men in this Life, you &s;ay) <HI>God acts as a &s;overeign Lord of his Favours: In the other, as a righteous Judge.</HI> Now is it not certain that the Be&s;tow|ment of <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Grace belongs to the State of <HI>Probation</HI> in this Life, and not to the State of <HI>Retribution</HI> in the Life to come?

<P>II. To con&s;ider what <HI>you have offered</HI> to invalidate Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Arguments, advanced in Favour of the <HI>Negative</HI> Part of the Que&s;tion. Where it is ob&s;ervable, after you have propo&s;ed the Que&s;tion, as above, your fir&s;t Attack is by way of Query, thus; <HI>But, pray Sir, how did you prove it? Why by this Argument</HI>; <Q>If God had bound him&s;elf by his <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> to any of his Creatures, he is no more at perfect <HI>Liberty,</HI> either to grant, or with-hold the promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ing, as may plea&s;e him.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Now</HI> (&s;ay you) <HI>&s;urely if this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no Promi&s;e at all, to Good, or Bad, is con&s;i&s;tent with the divine Sovereignty</HI>; and &s;o on.&mdash;</P>
<P>Here, Sir, you mu&s;t have Patience with me, whil&s;t: I attempt to &s;et this Matter in a true Light; becau&s;e, I apprehend, you have at lea&s;t, when we have made the be&s;t of it, here committed a <HI>Blundery,</HI> and then made your own Mi&s;take the intire Ground of your break|ing out into &s;ome warm Reflections upon the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooke,</HI> Author of the <HI>Sermon</HI> referr'd to; as excluding the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> and contem|ning the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> as an <HI>utterly &s;en&s;ele&s;s</HI> and <HI>unmeaning Thing.</HI> P. 21, 22. An awful Charge this! and &s;till more &s;o to him that brings it again&s;t another, if founded intirely on his own <HI>Mi&s;take.</HI> Now, in or|der to &s;et this Matter in a clear View, it may not be ami&s;s, to take No|tice, that the Argument quoted by you is fetcht from the <HI>Author</HI>'s Improvement of that Subject, in the Way of <HI>Inference,</HI> viz: <Q>That it is a great <HI>Mi&s;take,</HI> and of very <HI>dangerous</HI> Con&s;equence, which many carnal Per&s;on under the Light of the Go&s;pel fall into, who
<PB N="14" REF="006010_0012_102771B022BC0760">
will per&s;uade them&s;elves, that they are <HI>able</HI> (with the common Concurrence of divine Providence in upholding their Beings and Faculties) to <HI>do that</HI> which hath a certain <HI>Connection</HI> with, or which &s;hall <HI>a&s;&s;uredly i&s;&s;ue in,</HI> their <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> and eternal Salvation.</Q> (<HI>Serm.</HI> Pag. 16.) That is, as the <HI>Author</HI> abundantly explains him|&s;elf, throughout the following Part of that Di&s;cour&s;e, <Q>They per|&s;wade them&s;elves, that they are able to <HI>do that,</HI> which will <HI>intitle</HI> them to certain <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of the Be&s;towment of <HI>effectual Grace.</HI></Q>&mdash; And having &s;aid &s;everal Things for the Illu&s;tration of this Point, he at length argues in this Form, <HI>viz:</HI> <Q>If God be a <HI>Sovereign</HI> Di&s;pen&s;er of his &s;aving Graces and Favours, and may grant or with-hold them, according to his <HI>meer good Plea&s;ure,</HI> as I have en|deavoured before to &s;hew; then Sinners in their <HI>natural</HI> State have no <HI>Claim</HI> to the <HI>Promi&s;es.</HI></Q>&mdash;The Form of Rea&s;oning here made u&s;e of, is plainly that of an <HI>hypothetic</HI> Syllogi&s;m.&mdash;The <HI>A&s;|&s;umption,</HI> or Minor Propo&s;ition, viz. <Q><HI>That God is a &s;overeign Di&s;|pen&s;er of his &s;aving Grace, and may give, or with hold it, according to his meer good Plea&s;ure,</HI></Q> This the Author intimates he had before made good. The <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> is clear and undeniable, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That if God be a <HI>Sovereign</HI> Di&s;pen&s;er of his &s;aving Grace to Sinners, may grant, or with-hold it, according to his meer good Plea&s;ure, then, <HI>Sinners have no Claim to it by gracious Promi&s;es made by God to any Doings of theirs.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now the whole De&s;ign of the <HI>Author</HI> in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Words (quoted by you) was to confirm this <HI>Con&s;equence</HI>; and lay open the <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> there is, between God's be&s;towing &s;aving Grace on the Sinner, in the way of <HI>&s;overeign free Favour,</HI> as being at perfect <HI>Li|berty,</HI> either to grant, or with-hold it, according to his meer good Plea&s;ure,&mdash;And his acting herein at the &s;ame time in the Character of a Judge or Rewarder, <HI>obliged</HI> by his <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> to the Doings of the Sinner. And the Words fully an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e, for which they were u&s;ed; for if God once makes a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> to his Creatures, he is no more at perfect <HI>Liberty,</HI> whether to grant, or withhold the promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ing. So that the <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> between the&s;e two is equal to that of the &s;ame Per&s;on's being <HI>bound</HI> and <HI>free,</HI> at the &s;ame Time, and in the &s;ame Re&s;pect: Things impo&s;&s;ible in Na|ture, oppo&s;ite States, Contraries, that can never agree to one and the &s;ame Per&s;on. So that if one of the&s;e be <HI>true,</HI> the other mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> Thus it is evident, the Words you quote, do fully prove what they were brought to prove.</P>
<P>Now in&s;tead of properly denying any Part of the Argument, or di&s;covering any Weakne&s;s in it, you only with great A&s;&s;urance af|firm,
<PB N="15" REF="006010_0013_102771B1AE1DE880">
that <HI>&s;urely if this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no</HI> Promi&s;e <HI>at all, to God or Bad, is con&s;i&s;tent with the Divine</HI> Sovereign|ty: <HI>and then where is there any Place for any</HI> New Covenant, <HI>or indeed</HI> Old <HI>either? And if the Ca&s;e be &s;o</HI> (&s;ay you) <HI>away with the Bible &s;ure enough?</HI> and &s;o on.</P>
<P>But pray, Sir, think a little, whether you have Truth with you, in what you here affirm. You &s;ay, <HI>If this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no Promi&s;e as all, to God or Bad, is con&s;i&s;tent with the di|vine Sovereignty</HI>&mdash;With your Leave, Sir, Had you here ju&s;tly and carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed, and &s;aid, This Argument proves, that no Promi&s;e at all to Good or Bad, is con&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute <HI>Sovereign|ty,</HI> in Re&s;pect to conferring the Good promi&s;ed: <HI>i.e.</HI> That there|in God acts not as a <HI>Sovereign,</HI> at perfect Liberty, to grant, or to with-hold the Good promi&s;ed; becau&s;e, in that Particular, he hath <HI>obliged</HI> him&s;elf by his gracious <HI>Promi&s;e</HI>: you had expre&s;&s;ed your &s;elf much more agreeable to the <HI>Truth.</HI> This is what that Argument was brought to prove, and undeniably does prove.&mdash;But, <HI>Dear Sir,</HI> How does this exclude the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> or not leave any <HI>Place for it</HI>? or how does it <HI>contemn the Sacred Scriptures, as a meer Impo&s;ture, a meer Force, and utterly a &s;en&s;ele&s;s and unmeaning Thing</HI>? Had you, Sir, kept to Truth in this In&s;tance, you had &s;aved all tho&s;e hard Speeches, with which you fill up a great Part of three Pages together, (p. 21, 22, 23.)</P>
<P>However, granting, this Argument proves, as is above conceded, yet how does it from hence appear, that <HI>no Promi&s;e,</HI> to Good or Bad, is <HI>&s;o</HI> con&s;i&s;tent with the divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> as to allow any Place for <HI>New Covenant,</HI> or <HI>Old</HI> either, or the <HI>Being</HI> of any Promi&s;es at all! This is what you confidently enough affirm, that the Argument proves, if it proves any Thing. But this is your own grand Mi&s;|take: you have, in this particular, evidently gone beyond the Truth. How do you infer, that <HI>if God's obliging him&s;elf by gracious Promi&s;es, to any of his Creatures, be incon&s;i&s;tent with his being at Li|berty to giant or with-hold the Thing promi&s;ed, then it is incon&s;i&s;tent al&s;o with his making any Promi&s;es at all, or entering into any Covenant at all!</HI> I can't &s;ee how God's being <HI>obliged</HI> by his Promi&s;es, <HI>when made</HI> to any of his Creatures, and &s;o not being at Liberty to perform, or not perform them, as he plea&s;eth, does in the lea&s;t militate again&s;t the <HI>Being</HI> of any Promi&s;es at all, or &s;ubvert the New Covenant.</P>
<P>Further,</P>
<P>Are not the <HI>Author</HI>'s Words, which you quote, and call <HI>this Ar|gument,</HI> mo&s;t evidently <HI>true</HI>? Nay, are they not &s;o true, as that, from Rea&s;on, Scripture, and the Attributes of God, it is impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="16" REF="006010_0014_102771BAAFA743B8">
they &s;hould be otherwi&s;e than true? For if a Promi&s;e made to ano|ther be, in it's own Nature, <HI>binding,</HI> and God be a God of <HI>Truth,</HI> who <HI>cannot lie,</HI> then it is impo&s;&s;ible but that, if God makes a Pro|mi&s;e to any of his Creatures, it mu&s;t be binding, and his Truth obliges him to Performance. Which is the Sum total of what is contained in the Author's Words. And if &s;o, how was it po&s;&s;ible, Sir, that you &s;hould make (&s;hall I &s;ay?) &s;uch dreadful Work, with a plain, rational, &s;criptural Truth, as on the Account thereof, to throw out tho&s;e black Imputations on the Rev. <HI>Author</HI>! However, I charitably hope and believe that all this, in you, ari&s;es from nothing wor&s;e than a gro&s;s Mi&s;take, and may be imputed to a too ha&s;ty Proceeding, without clear Ideas. Yet in Faithfulne&s;s to the Cau&s;e of Truth, and to you, Rev. Sir, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, 'tis evidently &s;uch a Mi&s;take as is very <HI>blame-worthy,</HI> and &s;carce excu&s;able.&mdash;And that,</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e on this <HI>Mi&s;take</HI> alone you evidently ground all tho&s;e <HI>cen&s;orious,</HI> and <HI>unchri&s;tian Reflections</HI> you make on the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooke,</HI> in your Letter, <HI>Pag.</HI> 21, 22, 23. Where you repre&s;ent him as one <HI>flying in the Face of the whole Scriptures; denying any Promi|&s;es at all&mdash;de&s;troying the very Being of the New Covenant&mdash;and by Con&s;equence, of the whole De&s;ign, and Purport of all revealed Religion!</HI> This you confe&s;s is a <HI>heavy Charge,</HI> and grieve over the Gentle|ness having brought it upon him&s;elf, and then re&s;olve all into this, as the Means by which he has done it, <HI>viz.</HI> his having a&s;&s;erted, that, <HI>If God had once bound him&s;elf by his Promi&s;e to any of his Creatures, be is no more at perfect Liberty either to grant or with-hold the promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ing, as may plea&s;e him, but is inviolably holden by his own Promi&s;e.</HI> A Truth, as evident both from <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> (and as inno|cently a&s;&s;erted) as any other Truth in the whole Book of God: And yet, by &s;ome unknown Art of yours, the Rev. Author mu&s;t be thus blackned! How is it po&s;&s;ible for Innocence it &s;elf to e&s;cape, where men will allow them&s;elves in &s;uch Treatment of one ano|ther?</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Aggravation attending this Mi&s;take, is, that it was committed in a Ca&s;e &s;o exceeding <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>ea&s;y</HI>; that it is &s;carce conceivable, how any one unprejudic'd and duly di&s;po&s;ed (though but of a common Capacity) &s;hould fall into it.&mdash;Had the Ca&s;e re|quired uncommon Sagacity, deep Penetration, or accurate Di&s;cern|ing, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h between God's Promi&s;es obliging him &s;o as to be incon&s;i&s;tent with his being at perfect Liberty, either to perform or not perform them, <HI>when made,</HI> and their obliging him &s;o as to be incon&s;i&s;tent with their <HI>being made</HI> at all,&mdash;the Mi&s;take had
<PB N="17" REF="006010_0015_102771BC575079B0">
been much more excu&s;able. But &s;ince tho&s;e Ideas are, not only di&s;tinct, but very manife&s;tly &s;o, it is hardly conceivable, how any one &s;hould imagine &s;uch a Connexion, or &s;o near a Relation be|tween them, as that the one &s;hould be infer'd from the other; which is the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>To conclude this Particular, though I am re&s;olved, &s;o far as po&s;|&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tent with Truth, to be on the charitable Side: Yet I can do no le&s;s than refer it to your own &s;erious Con&s;ideration, whether it be not evidently from your own intire <HI>Mi&s;take,</HI> at lea&s;t, that you charge all tho&s;e frightful Things mentioned on the Rev. Author: And if you find this to be the Ca&s;e, I would charitably hope, you will give the World Conviction by your Practice, as well as by your Words (Page 1.) <HI>That you de&s;ire nothing more, than to know the Truth, that you may be governed by it.</HI></P>
<P>You go on to produce &s;ome Proof, <HI>that there are Promi&s;es, in the Scriptures</HI>: what no one, I &s;uppo&s;e, ever denied. You appeal to any Man of common Sen&s;e, that reads the <HI>Bible</HI> carefully, whether there be not <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> in it: And then very gravely quote 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 4. to prove the Point. Here I &s;hall only appeal, with you, to any Man of common Sen&s;e, whether this Management be not trifling, and unworthy a grave Divine? But you carry on your Appeal &s;till further, and expo&s;tulate, "<HI>Whether it be not manife&s;tly the De&s;ign and Tendency of the whole Scriptures, from the Beginning to the End, to inculcate the&s;e two Points,</HI> viz. <HI>To put Mankind upon the mo&s;t vigorous Activity in &s;eeking and pur&s;uing their everla&s;ting Happine&s;s</HI>; and then <HI>to a&s;certain to them Succe&s;s in &s;o doing</HI>?" Is it not (<HI>&s;ay you</HI>) one of the fir&s;t Things you read in <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> after the Fall (4. 7.) <HI>If thou do&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted</HI>? And the la&s;t in <HI>Revela|tions</HI> (22. 14) <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have a Right to the Tree of Life</HI>?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, If the&s;e qualifying Words, viz. <HI>through well doing,</HI> be ad|ded, either expre&s;ly or implicitly, to your Propo&s;itions, they are both true, and can be made good from the Scriptures: otherwi&s;e they are both fal&s;e; for the Scripture no where puts Mankind upon &s;eeking their everla&s;ting Happine&s;s, or a&s;certains them Succe&s;s in the Pur&s;uit, in any other Way than that of <HI>Well-doing,</HI> truly &s;uch in the Account of <HI>God, i. e.</HI> Doing <HI>his Commandments</HI>; which being thus under&s;tood (as certainly they mu&s;t be, in order either to their being true, or there being any Pertinency in the <HI>Texts</HI> brought for their Proof) what is there in them to your Purpo&s;e? Will the Con|&s;equence hold good, That, becau&s;e God has promi&s;ed <HI>eternal Life</HI> to tho&s;e, who do his Commandments (who in the Way of <HI>Well-doing
<PB N="18" REF="006010_0016_102771C3D88C7838">
&s;eek for Glory</HI>) Therefore he has promi&s;ed the Be&s;towment of <HI>&s;pe|cial Grace,</HI> to the Doings of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> that are under the Guilt and Dominion of Sin?</P>
<P>How then you &s;hould once imagine (if really you did &s;o) that the&s;e <HI>Texts</HI> had any Reference to the Que&s;tion in Hand, is beyond me to conceive; unle&s;s it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>well-doing</HI> in the Account of God, or (which is the &s;ame) <HI>Doing his Commandments,</HI> &s;o as to have <HI>Right to the Tree of Life,</HI> is what agrees to the <HI>Unregene|rate,</HI> under the Guilt and Dominion of Sin: which certainly none will pretend to.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Is it not exceeding clear from the Occa&s;ion and De&s;ign of tho&s;e Words, quoted from <HI>Gen.</HI> 4. 7.

<P>If, by a <HI>conditional Right to the Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed,</HI> you mean a Right to <HI>Grace and Glory, and every good Thing,</HI> pa&s;s'd over to us in Ca&s;e of an <HI>upright Walk</HI> before God, I readily grant it; and that this Right is given us on the Score of God's meer Grace in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> But if you mean (as I think you mu&s;t, in Order to mean any Thing to your Purpo&s;e) by a <HI>conditional Right to Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed,</HI> a Right to the Be&s;towment of <HI>effectual converting Grace,</HI> pa&s;s'd over to the <HI>Unrege|nerate,</HI> on Condition of certain Doings of <HI>theirs</HI>; in this Ca&s;e you proceed on a fal&s;e <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> and evidently take for granted, that very Point in Debate, and which you &s;hould have proved. "<HI>In his Right therefore</HI> (&s;ay you) <HI>we mu&s;t plead, who has purcha&s;ed this Be|nefit for us, and not in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do, which we can only humbly con&s;ider as meer Qualifications, nece&s;&s;ary to render us capable of receiving what God in Chri&s;t hath freely promi&s;ed.&mdash; We mu&s;t plead.</HI>&mdash;if you here mean pleading for the Be&s;towment of effectual <HI>converting</HI> Grace; and if by <HI>any Thing we do</HI> being <HI>con&s;idered only at meer Qualifications,</HI> &amp;c. you mean &s;omething le&s;s than what hath in it the Nature of a <HI>Condition,</HI> What is this &s;hort of giving up the Que&s;tion?

of converting Grace, by Virtue of any Promi&s;es made to his own Doings or Endeavours, is the very Thing called in Que&s;tion and therefore I call it a <HI>Suppo&s;ition not true,</HI> and till it be proved, mu&s;t look upon it in that Light.</P>
<P>In a Word, what you have &s;aid above of a <HI>Conditional Right pa&s;&s;ed over to us,</HI> and <HI>of the Benefit purcha&s;ed for us,</HI> was either meant to in|clude in it the Idea of a conditional <HI>Right</HI> to the Be&s;towment of <HI>con|verting</HI> Grace, pa&s;&s;ed over to <HI>unregenerate</HI> Sinners, or not.

But if <HI>not,</HI> then what you have there &s;aid, is nothing to the Purpo&s;e. And &s;o I may pa&s;s on to con&s;ider the Grounds of what you further advance by Way of <HI>Charge</HI> again&s;t the Rev. <HI>Author,</HI> in the following Words.&mdash;</P>
<P>"<HI>It was therefore</HI> (&s;ay you) <HI>very unju&s;t for you to put Things in &s;uch a ridiculous Lights as you did, to talk of</HI> owing, claiming, challenging, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>By Way of Reply here, I &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. It may be con&s;idered, that the Author, in making U&s;e of the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, was only de&s;igning to per&s;onate tho&s;e of your Opinion, who maintain, that <HI>converting Grace</HI> is be&s;towed according to <HI>Works</HI> done by the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, <HI>in the Way of God's performing his Covenant-Engagements,</HI> made to cer|tain <HI>Seekings</HI> and <HI>Strivings</HI> of theirs. And now becau&s;e the Author did not &s;et him&s;elf to correct their &s;everal Ways of expre&s;&s;ing their own Ideas in this Matter;&mdash;as one, That <HI>by his Endeavours he was in&s;ured of the Be&s;towment of effectual Grace</HI>; Another, That <HI>he was entitled, had a Claim, or Right</HI>:&mdash;A Third, That <HI>he was thereby inter|e&s;ted</HI>;&mdash;And &s;ome &s;o bold in Expre&s;&s;ion, as to a&s;&s;ert, That <HI>God had promi&s;ed to their Endeavours, and by their Endeavours they could therefore challenge</HI>:&mdash; Becau&s;e (I &s;ay) the Author did not enter into Di&s;pute with this Sort of People, for their <HI>a&s;&s;uming</HI> and <HI>challenging</HI> Language, nor teach them in what Manner of Expre&s;&s;ion, Per&s;ons of <HI>that Opi|nion</HI> &s;hould addre&s;s them&s;elves to God, which did not at all belong to his Subject, but in&s;tead thereof endeavoured to convince them of the grand <HI>Error at Bottom,</HI> which was the mi&s;taken Ground of all that Variety of bold Phra&s;es made U&s;e of by them; therefore he is thus very <HI>unju&s;t,</HI> in your Judgment: But, I charitably believe, not &s;o on this Account, in any other Per&s;on's in all the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is ob&s;ervable here, that what you condemn in the Author,
<PB N="23" REF="006010_0021_1026E534F1224EE0">
as <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;etting Things in a ridiculous Light,</HI> is not the menio|ning only of &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, but of &s;uch a <HI>Variety,</HI> and of &s;ome as well as others; as &s;eems evident by your adding an <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (Page 24) Now had the Author mentioned only &s;uch Phra&s;es as &s;ounded mo&s;t <HI>har&s;h,</HI> to expre&s;s that Connexion between the Do|ings of the Unregenerate and the Be&s;towment of effectual Grace, maintained by tho&s;e of your Opinion; or had you condemned only &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions, I had readily &s;o far conceded. But &s;ince the Au|thor makes U&s;e of a great Variety of Expre&s;&s;ions, and among o|thers, of many of the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> Sort, by which &s;uch Connexion can po&s;|&s;ibly be expre&s;&s;ed, &s;uch as&mdash;the Sinner's being by his Endeavours <HI>In&s;ured, A&s;&s;ured, Intitled, Intere&s;ted;</HI> nay, <Q>doing that which hath a <HI>certain Connexion</HI> with, or which &s;hall <HI>&s;urely i&s;&s;ue</HI> in their Conver&s;ion.</Q> (<HI>Ser.</HI> Pag. 16, 17, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) And &s;ince you condemn, in the Author, the U&s;e of the&s;e <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> Expre&s;&s;ions, by which any <HI>&s;ure Connexion</HI> between the Sin|ner's Endeavours, and the Be&s;towment of effectual Grace, can po&s;&s;ibly be expre&s;s'd; Is not this again entirely to give up the Que&s;tion? For if the U&s;e of the lowe&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions, by which this <HI>Connexion</HI> can be expre&s;s'd, is to be condemned as <HI>very unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>putting of Things in a ridiculous Light,</HI> it mu&s;t be becau&s;e there is indeed <HI>no Connexion</HI> between the Doings of the Unregenerate, and the Be&s;towment of effectual Grace: And if &s;o, then <HI>no Promi&s;es</HI> made to the&s;e at all.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd here with a View to make this Charge good again&s;t the Author, is, <HI>That the Matter, and indeed the very Being of the Promi&s;es, is Matter of free Grace.</HI> But what Force of Argument does this carry with it? Have not you with your own Pen confu&s;|ed this Rea&s;on, by what you &s;ay in your 23d Page? Where, hav|ing conceded, That <HI>the Matter and Being of the Promi&s;es is of meer &s;o|vereign free Grace,</HI> you &s;ubjoin, <Q><HI>But &s;urely notwith&s;tanding this, when he has been plea&s;ed to grant us the&s;e precious Promi&s;es, it mu&s;t have been his De&s;ign to pa&s;s over a Right to us of the Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now,</P>
<P>That the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Being</HI> of the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> being Matter of <HI>meer</HI> Grace &s;hould in <HI>pag.</HI> 23. be <HI>no Rea&s;on</HI> at all, why a <HI>Right</HI> &s;hould <HI>not pa&s;s by &s;uch Promi&s;es,</HI> and yet be a&s;&s;igned as a <HI>good Rea&s;on</HI> (in <HI>p.</HI> 24) to cen&s;ure the <HI>Author</HI> you have in Dealing, as <HI>very unju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>ridiculing your Doctrine,</HI> while repre&s;enting it as a&s;&s;erting a <HI>Right pa&s;&s;ed by &s;uch Promi&s;es</HI>; this mu&s;t, I think, be placed among the Incon&s;i&s;tencies of your Letter.&mdash;So very difficult a thing is it, for any one, in the De|fence of <HI>Error,</HI> con&s;tantly to &s;peak the &s;ame Things!

for Chri&s;t' s coming to <HI>Judgment</HI> mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t; and what will be the main <HI>Inquiry</HI> of the <HI>great Day,</HI> upon which the final Deci&s;ion of our everla&s;ting Fate will then turn, <HI>viz.</HI> whether we have done <HI>well,</HI> or <HI>ill,</HI> in the Account of the New Covenant? whether we've been <HI>good</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> Servants of the Lord, or <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>&s;lothful,</HI> in the Management of the <HI>Talents,</HI> with which we have been in|tru&s;ted?&mdash;</P>
<P>This doubtle&s;s will readily be granted by every impartial atten|tive Reader, who duly con&s;iders the Occa&s;ion of this <HI>Parable,</HI> viz. The Di&s;cour&s;e, begun by our Saviour, in the preceeding Chapter, of his Second coming to <HI>Judgment,</HI> and continued down through this: followed here <HI>fir&s;t</HI> with the Parable of <HI>the Ten Virgins,</HI> evidently referring to Chri&s;t's Coming to Judgment, at the End of the World, and principally de&s;ign'd to awaken Chri&s;tians to the greater Watch|fulne&s;s from the Con&s;ideration of the Uncertainty of the Time. v.13. <HI>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the Day nor the Hour, wherein the Son of Man cometh.</HI>&mdash;Next follows this Parable of the <HI>Talents,</HI> ma|nife&s;tly de&s;ign'd (as has been ob&s;erved) to hold forth wherein our <HI>Readine&s;s</HI> for Chri&s;t's &s;econd Coming to <HI>Judgment</HI> will con&s;i&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> in our having <HI>&s;incerely improved the Advantages,</HI> with which we have been intru&s;ted, and &s;o having approv'd our&s;elves <HI>good and faithful Servants,</HI>in the Account of the <HI>New Covenant.</HI> And wherein this will con&s;i&s;t, is further illu&s;trated in a particular In&s;tance, put for all the re&s;t, viz. that of honouring the Lord with our Sub&s;tance, in Acts of <HI>Charity</HI> to the Poor, done for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Sake: contain'd in a De&s;cription of the Proce&s;s of the <HI>la&s;t Judgment,</HI> continued to the End of the Chapter.&mdash;And hence,</P>
<P N="2">2. By the <HI>Reckoning,</HI> here mentioned as <HI>deferred for a long Time</HI> is plainly to be under&s;tood the <HI>final Account,</HI> which we mu&s;t all in that Day render to God, of our re&s;pective Improvements. This is fur|ther evident from the Reward a&s;&s;ign'd to the <HI>Faithful,</HI> and the Doom pa&s;&s;ed on the <HI>Unfaithful.</HI> To the one is &s;aid, <HI>Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord</HI>: but of the other,&mdash;<HI>Ca&s;e the unprofitable Servant into outer Darkne&s;s, there &s;hall be Weeping and Gna&s;hing of Teeth.</HI> Where our Saviour in&s;en&s;ibly &s;lide, out of the <HI>Parable,</HI> into the <HI>Thing</HI> in|tended to be &s;ignified: and thereby gives us an infallible Key to the whole; it being plain here, that the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>Outer Dark|ne&s;s,</HI> where there is <HI>Weeping</HI> and <HI>Gna&s;hing of Teeth,</HI> are, by a Pe|riphrases, u&s;ed by our Saviour to &s;ignify the Mi&s;eries of the Damned in <HI>Hell.</HI>&mdash;Hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. It follows, that by <HI>him that hath,</HI> is evidently meant one who &s;hall <HI>then</HI> be found to <HI>have,</HI> in the Account of God, what the New
<PB N="26" REF="006010_0024_102771D53A5CA898">
Covenant requires, what in the Eye of that Covenant will denomi|nate him a <HI>Good and Faithful Servant,</HI> or one that has <HI>done well.</HI> This is plain, in Regard 'tis with an evident Reference to the making up of that final Account in the Day of <HI>Judgment,</HI> that he is here &s;aid to <HI>have.</HI>&mdash;And hence,</P>
<P N="4">4. It is equally evident, that by the following Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>To him &s;hall be given,</HI> is meant the <HI>final Reward</HI> of Glory in the future World.&mdash;</P>
<P>Now if the <HI>Reckoning</HI> here mentioned, refers intirely to the final Account in the Day of <HI>Judgment</HI>; and if it be the Scope and De|&s;ign of this <HI>Parable,</HI> to point out what that is, which will then &s;tand us in Stead, in that Day of <HI>Reckoning,</HI> viz. <HI>Well-doing,</HI> in the Ac|count of the <HI>New-Covenant</HI>; And if by <HI>him that hath,</HI> be meant one that hath already exemplified that <HI>Well-doing,</HI> and is thereupon adjudg'd unto <HI>Glory</HI>; How is it po&s;&s;ible that the <HI>&s;eeking &s;triving Sinner,</HI> "not yet converted throughly from Sin to God," but "&s;till under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin," &s;hould be "the Man <HI>that hath,</HI> in our Saviour's Sen&s;e," in this Parable?&mdash;What <HI>hath</HI> &s;uch a Man? <HI>Hath</HI> he that which would &s;tand him in &s;tead, were he <HI>now</HI> &s;tanding at the Bar of God? <HI>Hath</HI> he what the <HI>New Covenant</HI> demands? <HI>Hath</HI> he what, in the Eye of that Covenant, will denominate him a <HI>good and faithful Servant,</HI> one that <HI>has done well,</HI> and &s;tands intitled to eternal <HI>Glory?</HI> Can this po&s;&s;ibly be true of one, who (according to your own Conce&s;&s;ion) is <Q>under the Do|minion and Guilt of Sin,</Q> and con&s;equently an Unbeliever and an Impenitent in the Go&s;pel-Sen&s;e, unreconciled to God, and in a State of Enmity and Rebellion again&s;t God, and under a righteous Sen|tence of Condemnation? Nay, is not <HI>the Man that hath, to whom &s;hall be given,</HI> in this <HI>Parable</HI> of the Talents, evidently repre&s;ented by our Saviour as one who has pa&s;s'd the awful <HI>Trial</HI> of the Great Day, and is publickly approved, and welcomed to Glory? <HI>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant,&mdash;enter into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI> And does the <HI>&s;eeking, &s;triving</HI> Sinner, which you de&s;cribe, an&s;wer the Character of <HI>this</HI> Man? Hath he pa&s;s'd his la&s;t Trial? Is he openly approv'd of his Lord, and welcomed to the State of the Ble&s;&s;ed? How therefore you could, &s;o confidently as you do, af|firm <HI>him</HI> to be <HI>this Man,</HI> in our <HI>Saviour's Sen&s;e,</HI> I mu&s;t leave.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould excu&s;e your Mi&s;take, by alledging the Judgment of &s;ome <HI>great and learned Men,</HI> that have con&s;trued this Parable in Fa|vour of the Opinion you here advance; I an&s;wer, <HI>Every Error,</HI> ad|vanced in the Chri&s;tian World, has its Pretence of being grounded on &s;ome Text of <HI>Scripture.</HI> Nor is this at all to be wonder'd at: for
<PB N="27" REF="006010_0025_102771DEE7F23628">
when once Per&s;ons have fallen into any erroneous Opinion, the Fruit of their own Imagination, and what appears to them rea&s;onable, in their own very partial View of Things, they will ea&s;ily fancy &s;uch Opinion &s;upported by this or that Text of &s;acred <HI>Scripture</HI>; it mat be, by a great Variety: And &s;ometimes (becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible, in that Ca&s;e, to fix upon any Text, that is full and clear to their Pur|po&s;e) they pretend, that the <HI>Current of the whole Scripture</HI> runs that Way, from the Beginning of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the End of <HI>Revelation.</HI> Ne|verthele&s;s, certainly this is not to come to the Scriptures as a pure Fountain, to derive our Opinions from thence; but to bring our O|pinions with us to the Scripture, and by the Help of a &s;trong Imagi|nation, to mould the Bible by them. Now,</P>
<P>This I take to be evidently the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e who urge a Promi&s;e to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> from this <HI>Parable.</HI> They fir&s;t, it &s;eems, con|clude from their own View of Things, that &s;uch a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> to the Sin|ner is highly <HI>rea&s;onable,</HI> as may &s;ecure it in <HI>his own Power</HI> (at lea&s;t <HI>morally</HI>) to be everla&s;tingly <HI>happy</HI>: Which Conclu&s;ion being ground|ed partly on a <HI>favourable</HI> Thought of the State of the fallen Creature, e&s;pecially on the State of an <HI>awakened reforming</HI> Sinner, as de&s;crib|ed above, they &s;eem to conceive &s;ome <HI>Fitne&s;s</HI> in &s;uch a State of the Sinner, <HI>qualifying him for Help from God,</HI> and con&s;tituting him a pro|per Subject of <HI>gracious Promi&s;es.</HI> This &s;eems to be intimated in your Notion of there being a certain "<HI>Medium</HI> between an <HI>obs&s;tinate relentle&s;s Sinner,</HI> and one that is <HI>throughly regenerate,</HI> or intirely devoted to God," and &s;eems to be the Ground of your in&s;i&s;ting that the Sinner be brought to "<HI>&s;trive in earne&s;t,</HI> that he may be <HI>quali|fied for God's Help.</HI>"&mdash;And now being fix'd in this Opinion, that there is a <HI>Meetne&s;s</HI> in this State of a Sinner to receive <HI>Help</HI> (i. e. <HI>efficaci|ous Aid,</HI> or &s;pecial Grace) <HI>from God,</HI> the&s;e Gentlemen bringing this Opinion with them to the &s;acred Text, they read here that <HI>To every one that hath, &s;hall be given,</HI> and thence conclude a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> from God made to the <HI>&s;triving Sinner,</HI> though not yet thorowly devoted to God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But, good Sir, by who&s;e Authority do they make this Conclu&s;ion? Does; it &s;low from divine Promi&s;es? Chri&s;t indeed in the <HI>Parable</HI> hath &s;aid, <HI>Unto him that hath, &s;hall be given</HI>: But hath he any where: &s;aid, that the <HI>&s;triving</HI> (but unconverted) <HI>Sinner</HI> is this Man <HI>that hath</HI>? Or, Is there in all this <HI>Parable</HI> one Word, or Syllable, about the <HI>&s;triving Sinner,</HI> or of the Be&s;towment of <HI>converting Grace</HI>? Surely, nothing like it. No, This is the preconceived <HI>human Opinion</HI> (I &s;pake of) which every one brings with him to the <HI>divine Text,</HI> who infers a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> to Sinners from this <HI>Parable.</HI> And it is impo&s;&s;ible

to argue any Thing, for their Opinion, conclu&s;ively from the <HI>Para|ble</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>You go on to &s;ay, "<HI>And I am under an invincible Nece&s;&s;ity of un|der&s;tanding</HI> MATTH. 7. 7. and 11. 28.

But how do you prove this? Why fir&s;t by the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity you find your &s;elf under</HI> thus <HI>to under&s;tand them</HI>: You plead, that you are <HI>nece&s;&s;itated</HI> &s;o to under&s;tand them, and that you <HI>cannot for your Life help</HI> thus interpreting them, &amp;c.

<P>You proceed, and &s;ay,&mdash;"<HI>Can any one be &s;o ab&s;urd as to interpret the&s;e Promi&s;es thus?

<P>The Argument u&s;ed here is what is called <HI>Reductio ad Ab&s;urdum</HI>: And its whole Force lies in this That the&s;e <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> cannot be <HI>other-wi&s;e</HI> interpreted, than as belonging to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> while &s;uch, but by re&s;olving their Meaning into <HI>perfect Non&s;en&s;e.</HI> Now, if this can be proved, I own, the Argument mu&s;t be yielded: For, to be &s;ure, we mu&s;t not <HI>make perfect Non&s;en&s;e of</HI> the holy Scriptures.&mdash; But where is the Proof? You, Sir, indeed have &s;aid it; and that's all:&mdash;To refute this your Notion of the <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> of under&s;tanding the&s;e <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> otherwi&s;e, than as belonging to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whil&s;t &s;uch, it may &s;uffice to ob&s;erve, that it is intirely grounded on one or other, or all of the following <HI>fal&s;e Hypothe&s;es</HI>: viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the&s;e conditional Promi&s;es were not &s;poken, or meant to <HI>Believers,</HI> but to others <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="29" REF="006010_0027_102771E3A138D260">2.

<P N="3">3. That the <HI>asking, &s;eeking, knocking,</HI> and <HI>coming</HI> to Chri&s;t, unto which the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> is here annexed, are to be conceived as Doings that are <HI>&s;hort</HI> of that <HI>Faith,</HI> which implies a thorow Conver&s;ion to God in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e, I think, mu&s;t be the Suppo&s;itions, on which your Notion of the <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> of our Interpretation is intirely grounded; Which being fairly examined, and removed by the Force of Truth, the&s;e <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> may be interpreted as we under&s;tand them, without any the lea&s;t Shadow of <HI>Ab&s;urdity,</HI> and be &s;ure, without any Danger of their being made <HI>perfect Non&s;en&s;e.</HI> And now,</P>

"<HI>You that have already received the &s;pecial Grace of God,</HI> that are true Believers, Heirs of the Promi&s;es, that have Grace and Glory and very good Thing laid up in them, <HI>Ask; and ye &s;hall receive</HI>;&mdash; you <HI>who have already found Mercy, Seek and ye &s;hall find,</HI> i. e. further Mercy, or <HI>more Grace.</HI> Is it <HI>ab&s;urd,</HI> that he which hath <HI>Life,</HI> &s;hould <HI>have it more abundantly</HI>?

<P N="2">2. To evince the utter <HI>Fal&s;ene&s;s</HI> of each of the&s;e <HI>Suppo&s;itions.</HI>&mdash; And,</P>
<P N="1">1.

And likewi&s;e that what is &s;aid by our Saviour in <HI>Luk.</HI> 11. 13. was &s;aid directly to his <HI>Di&s;ciples,</HI> on their Reque&s;t that he <HI>would teach them to pray,</HI> v. 1.

Nay, which is more, to make good this Suppo&s;ition, it mu&s;t be proved, that there was not one of the whole Company pre&s;ent a <HI>Believer.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Suppo&s;ition, that the <HI>Matter</HI> of the <HI>Petition</HI> and Inqui|ry here, or what is here enjoined to be <HI>asked</HI> and <HI>&s;ought,</HI> is limited to the fir&s;t Grace of <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> exclu&s;ive of con&s;equent Grace in <HI>progre&s;&s;ive</HI> Sanctification, is al&s;o evidently <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> For &s;ince the&s;e Du|ties were enjoined upon the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> them&s;elves, with Promi&s;es of Succe&s;s, and not on others <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of them, it mu&s;t therefore be impo&s;&s;ible, that the Matter of <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Inquiry</HI> enjoined them &s;hould be limited to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Grace, becau&s;e this they had <HI>already</HI> re|ceived; and therefore to enjoin them to ask and &s;eek <HI>that,</HI> would be an Incon&s;i&s;tency and Ab&s;urdity indeed.&mdash;The Suppo&s;ition,</P>
<P N="3">3. That the <HI>asking, &s;eeking,</HI> &amp;c. to which Succe&s;s is here <HI>promi&s;ed,</HI> are Doings &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of that <HI>Faith,</HI> which implies an intire Devotedne&s;s to God in Chri&s;t, is al&s;o evidently <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> For, if the <HI>asking</HI> and <HI>&s;eek|ing,</HI> &amp;c. to which the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> here is annex'd, be any Doings <HI>&s;hort of unfeigned Faith,</HI> then we are to under&s;tand our Saviour here to <HI>en|join</HI> the&s;e Duties without regarding their nece&s;&s;ary Principle, which is <HI>Faith.</HI> The Injunction ought in Rea&s;on to be interpreted in the &s;ame Latitude as the Promi&s;e that is annexed. And can it once be imagined, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour would enjoin his Di&s;ciples to <HI>ask, &s;eek,</HI> and <HI>knock</HI> by Prayer, without <HI>Faith unfeigned</HI>? Would not this be to teach them to approach unto God otherwi&s;e than through a <HI>Mediator</HI>; contrary to the grand De&s;ign of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI>? Which is &s;tiled Rom. 16. 26. <HI>The Revelation of the My&s;tery made known to all Nations for the Obedience of Faith.</HI> Would it not to be to enjoin what could by no Means be plea&s;ing or acceptable to God? Since (Heb. 11. 6.) <HI>Without Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</HI> Do not the Scriptures
<PB N="31" REF="006010_0029_102771EDA612AC70">
enjoin us (Col. 3. 17) <HI>to do all In the Name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>? And can this be done without <HI>Faith</HI>?

Seeing they declare it the Will of God (1 Tim. 2. 8.) <HI>That Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands, without Wrath and Doubting.</HI> And can Prayer be performed with <HI>holy Hands lifted up,</HI> where that <HI>Faith</HI> is wanting, which <HI>purifieth the Heart</HI> and Hands?

<P>Nor is it le&s;s evident, that the <HI>Coming to Chri&s;t,</HI> to which a Promi&s;e of Re&s;t &s;tands annexed (<HI>Matth.</HI> 11 28.) is plainly meant of comings by <HI>Faith</HI>; and it were ea&s;y to &s;hew, it is generally &s;o; under&s;tood by Divines, of every Denomination. But if an Appeal be had here from the Authority of Men to the Authority of God, and according to that mo&s;t excellent Rule of interpreting Scripture by Scripture, you are di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;t &s;atisfied in a Deci&s;ion of this Matter, by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, we then have it in <HI>John</HI> 6. 35. <HI>I am the Bread of Life: be that cometh to me, &s;hall never hun|ger; and be that believeth on me, &s;hall never thir&s;t.</HI> Where it is ex|ceeding obvious, that <HI>coming to Chri&s;t, as the Bread of Life,</HI> and <HI>be|lieving on him,</HI> are u&s;ed as Terms of the &s;ame Import, and equal Sig|nificancy: the &s;ame &s;piritual and everla&s;tingly &s;atisfying Ble&s;&s;ings being <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to each.</P>
<P>Now, upon the whole, If it be certain, that the <HI>Intire Rea&s;on</HI> you have a&s;&s;ign'd, why the&s;e Promi&s;es &s;hould be under&s;tood, as belong|ing to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whil&s;t &s;uch, is the <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> of under&s;tanding them <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI>; which indeed you &s;ay cannot be done without

<P>Now, Sir, for my own Part, though I am far from concluding, that <HI>every one,</HI> who is in this Error, is a <HI>Pelagian</HI>: Becau&s;e this may be the Ca&s;e with &s;ome, who have, ere they were aware, been induced, by what they have head plau&s;ibly &s;aid on this Point, to entertain a favourable Thought of it: Yet I am fully per&s;uaded, that this learn|ed BISHOP <HI>throughly under&s;tood what be here &s;ays,</HI> and that when ever <HI>Truth</HI> in this Point is &s;earched to the Bottom, the <HI>Affirmative</HI> Part of ike Que&s;tion will be found the pernicious Fruit of Error, growing on the <HI>Pelagian</HI> Root of denying the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> as held forth in our publick <HI>Confe&s;&s;ions</HI> of Faith, and in the <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Homilies</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI>:&mdash;And that, re&s;erving Credit to the Doc|trine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> it will be found a much harder Task to <HI>recon|cile</HI> with the <HI>Divine Attributes</HI> this unaccountable Notion of a <HI>Grant</HI> in the Go&s;pel, of <HI>New Covenant-Ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> on Condition of <HI>Old Cove|nant-Works,</HI> i. e. certain Doings of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whil&s;t &s;uch, than to reconcile with the Divine Attributes, the Notion of God's permiting fallen Mankind to come into the World in &s;uch a corrupt and &s;inful State, as not to have it &s;ecured in all Re&s;pects in their <HI>Power</HI> (as well <HI>Morally,</HI> i. e. notwith&s;tanding any inherent Viciou&s;|ne&s;s or Depravity, as <HI>naturally</HI>) to be everla&s;tingly <HI>happy.</HI> And here, Sir, by the Way, &s;ince you have been ready to impute it to <HI>Prejudice,</HI> when any among your <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Brethren</HI>(as you call them) have doubted of <HI>your Orthodoxy</HI> in the grand Point of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> I would ob&s;erve that you have now (on what is recited above) an advantage of con&s;idering the Matter more free from <HI>Prejudice</HI>; &s;ince it is not the doubtful Tho't, but firm per&s;ua&s;ion of one of your own <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> that the <HI>Error,</HI> which <HI>you</HI> plead for is the very <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Up|&s;hot</HI> of <HI>Pelagiani&s;m.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2.

<P>Omitting at pre&s;ent the three other &s;ub&s;ervient Con&s;iderations, mentioned by the <HI>Author</HI> in his Sermon, I &s;hall confine my Thoughts to the two above-recited: And con&s;idering the&s;e in one complex View, as they are of &s;uch near Affinity, and &s;o clo&s;ely connected, I &s;hall vindicate them both together, for Brevity's Sake.</P>
<P>Now, to open the Way to this Defence, allow me to make a few preliminary Ob&s;ervations. And I &s;ay in general, If it can be made evident, that to hold certain <HI>Seekings, Strivings,</HI> or <HI>Doings</HI> what&s;o|ever of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whil&s;t &s;uch, <HI>conditional</HI> of the Be&s;towment of <HI>&s;pecial converting Grace,</HI> or that to which the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of &s;uch Grace is made, be to countenance the fallen Creature's <HI>going about to e&s;tabli&s;h his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and to allow of that Boa&s;ting, to which the Go&s;pel every where expre&s;ly denies any Place in the Affair of <HI>bringing us unto God</HI>; it will then doubtle&s;s be acknowledged, upon &s;uch Evidence, that the <HI>Arguments</HI> above are &s;olid and conclu&s;ive.&mdash; And the Truth of the foregoing Propo&s;ition, may, I think, be evinc|ed by the following Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. That to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>&s;pecial converting Grace</HI> en&s;ured or &s;ecured to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> by a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> thereof made to any <HI>Doings</HI> of theirs, whil&s;t under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a <HI>Con|nection</HI> between &s;uch <HI>his Grace,</HI> and &s;uch <HI>their Doings,</HI> is to &s;uppo&s;e God's acting properly as a <HI>moral Governor</HI> in this Affair, and making the Sinner's <HI>Works</HI> the Rule of his Di&s;pen&s;ations, even in point of <HI>Regenerating</HI> Grace, or effectual Calling.&mdash;And again,</P>

the Nature of Things, that he &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>Rule,</HI> re&s;pecting the&s;e <HI>Doings</HI> of theirs as the <HI>Condition</HI> of his Promi&s;e, according to which, as a moral Governor, he conducts him&s;elf in the Di&s;pen&s;ation of his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;pecial Grace to Sinners.&mdash;And now,</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. That to teach for Doctrine, that any the be&s;t <HI>Endeavours</HI> and highe&s;t <HI>Improvements</HI> of Sinners <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> or in your Sen&s;e of the Word, &s;uch as are "<HI>not yet intirely devoted to God</HI>" are the reveal'd federal <HI>Condition</HI> of promi&s;ed converting <HI>Grace,</HI> is in true Con&s;truc|tion nothing le&s;s than to <HI>introduce</HI> into the Scheme of Salvation that very <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> which the Go&s;pel mo&s;t expre&s;ly <HI>&s;huts out,</HI> and to pa|troni&s;e that <HI>going about to e&s;tabli&s;h our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which is incon&s;i&s;tent with a due <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s that is of God by Faith.</HI>&mdash;This Conclu&s;ion will nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e out of the Premi|&s;es; which, as I apprehend, admit of the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t copious Proofs, from Revelation and Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>As to the Thing &s;uppo&s;ed in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Propo&s;ition, it appears to me one; of the leading Principles in the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, and is agreable (Sir) to your profe&s;s'd Opinion, That God di&s;pen&s;es his <HI>&s;pecial Grace,</HI> or in your Sen&s;e of the Words, his <HI>efficacious Aid,</HI> not as an ab&s;olute Proprietor and &s;overeign Benefactor, but as a <HI>moral Go|vernor,</HI> and <HI>righteous Judge</HI> of the Behaviour and Improvements of his Creatures.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Propo&s;ition, this is &s;trictly demon&s;trable from the fir&s;t; &s;ince to &s;uppo&s;e the Behaviour and Improvements of the Creature to be the <HI>Rule,</HI> which God re&s;pects, as a <HI>moral Gover|nor</HI> and <HI>righteous Judge,</HI> in the Di&s;pen&s;ation of his &s;pecial efficacious Grace, and yet at the &s;ame time to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;aid Behaviour and Im|provements quite <HI>devoid</HI> of all true moral <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> or vital <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> in the &s;ight of God, would be nothing le&s;s than to make two <HI>incompa|tible</HI> Suppo&s;itions, and to run your&s;elf into a flat <HI>Contradiction.</HI></P>
<P>So that the only Article in the Premi&s;es, that demands Proof, in

Order to bring out the Conclu&s;ion, and e&s;tabli&s;h the Argument in hand, is the <HI>third,</HI>&mdash;as above. And this again is too evident, to need any elaborate Confirmation of it. For the Sinner's conceiving &s;o highly of his own <HI>Doings,</HI> or any po&s;&s;ible <HI>Strivings, Seekings,</HI> or <HI>Comings to Chri&s;t,</HI> which he is capable of in his <HI>unregenerate</HI> Condition, and while (according to you) <HI>not yet thoroughly converted,</HI> as to imagine &s;ome true <HI>Virtue,</HI> &s;ome proper <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> or moral <HI>Rectitude</HI> in &s;uch his Performances and Endeavours, and accordingly to imagine a <HI>Right</HI> to the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>&s;pecial Grace,</HI> or Divine efficacious Aid, <HI>pa&s;s'd over to him</HI> by Means of the&s;e his Doings and Attempt though only as Compliances with the Divine conditional <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> in which God is &s;uppo&s;ed to have made a &s;ure <HI>connetion</HI> between renewing Grace and &s;uch Endeavours; <HI>This,</HI> if I know any thing of Go&s;pel-Humility, is not <HI>to think &s;oberly,</HI> but <HI>to think of him&s;elf more highly than he ought to think,</HI> as the Ca&s;e appears to me. Here is &s;piritual <HI>Pride,</HI> founded on vain Imaginations. Here are Fal&s;ehoods &s;et up for Truths, and improv'd to <HI>Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and to &s;uch <HI>Self-Boa&s;t|ing,</HI> as hath much of moral Evil in it. And methinks, none &s;hould doubt whether the Go&s;pel-Scheme of Salvation excludes <HI>this,</HI> when it is &s;o expre&s;ly declared that <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> (all &s;inful Boa&s;ting) <HI>is excluded by the Law of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>The only Point here, requiring Proof, I think is this, That the <HI>Suppo&s;ition</HI> of any true <HI>moral Excellency</HI> and <HI>&s;olid Goodne&s;s</HI> in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible Doings of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whil&s;t &s;uch, is but a meer <HI>Dream</HI> and <HI>vain Imagination.</HI></P>
<P>And though this appears to me inconte&s;tibly evident, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> from Scripture and Rea&s;on, yet becau&s;e I would not anticipate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at will more properly be offer'd in another Place hereafter, I &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t pre|&s;ent only &s;ugge&s;t and argue a little with you upon the Impo&s;&s;ibility, in the Nature of Things, that this <HI>Suppo&s;ition</HI> &s;hould be <HI>true.</HI> For, &s;ince the &s;ole original Standard, by which the moral Goodne&s;s or Rectitude of the Creatures Actions can be meae&s;ur'd and deter|mined, is the moral Perfections of God, and &s;ince <HI>Sin</HI> is the pre|dominant Principle in the <HI>unrenewed.</HI> Man, from whence all his Actions mu&s;t take their principal Denomination and have their Specification, how is it po&s;&s;ible for the be&s;t Doings of &s;uch a Man, while under the Dominion of <HI>Sin,</HI> to harmoni&s;e in any Degree with the moral Nature of God, &s;o as to be approvable in his Sight? It's impo&s;&s;ible then, that the <HI>Suppo&s;ition</HI> before us &s;hould have any Foundation in <HI>Truth.</HI>&mdash;And I argue upon this; If he be&s;t Doings of the Unregenerate have no proper moral Goodne&s;s in them, they then have no moral <HI>Fitne&s;s</HI> to be the <HI>Condition</HI> in a Divine <HI>Promi&s;e</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="006010_0040_1027721E0FC5BC28">
of &s;pecial Grace; and con&s;equently to plead &s;uch a morally unfit Condition though perform'd to the highe&s;t Degree that an unrege|nerate State will admit of, as intitling the Doer (in Virtue of a pre|tended Promi&s;e) to &s;aving Grace, is to <HI>rejoice in a Thing of Nought,</HI> and to <HI>bring in</HI> that vain <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> which the Go&s;pel-Scheme intirely <HI>&s;huts out.</HI> To &s;uppo&s;e therefore any <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, in God's Promi&s;e, cloathed with &s;uch a <HI>Conditionality,</HI> as hath this <HI>ex|cluded Boa&s;ting</HI> in&s;eparably connected with it, is nothing le&s;s than to <HI>pervert the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> and thwart its true De&s;ign, in this Par|ticular.</P>
<P>It appears to me a clear Scripture-Truth, that with a View to the <HI>Exclu&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> all <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate are, in the Scheme of the Go&s;pel excluded from being <HI>conditional</HI> of the Be&s;towment of <HI>&s;pecial Grace.</HI>&mdash;And this Truth, I think, is demon&s;trable from many plain Texts in &s;acred Writ. To in&s;tance in a few. We read, Tit. 3. 5. <HI>Not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which we have done, but according to his Mercy, be &s;aved us.</HI> 2. Tim. 1. 9. <HI>Who hath &s;aved us, and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works, but according to his own Purpo&s;e and Grace.</HI>&mdash;The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks not of a meer Salvability, but at <HI>actual Salvation</HI>; a&s;&s;erts a then-exi&s;ting State; and points out the Method of Introduction into it, both negatively and po&s;itively.&mdash;<HI>Hath &s;aved us.</HI> i. e. not only given us the external Means of Salvation, and brought us into his vi&s;ible Kingdom, but into a ju&s;tify'd and renew'd State; the Apo&s;tle &s;peaking this knowingly for him&s;elf, and charitably for others: nor can any rea&s;onable Doubt a|ri&s;e here of his u&s;ing the Word [&s;aved] in this Sen&s;e. And as to the Method of bringing them into this &s;aved State, he peremptorily determines it to be, in its negative View, <HI>not by Works of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s which they had done; not according to Works,</HI> any at all what&s;oever, previous to and conditional of the Be&s;towment of &s;aving Grace. He does not meerly &s;ay, not <HI>for</HI> Works, but not <HI>by</HI> or through them, yea, even not <HI>according to</HI> them, i, e. not with any Reference to them, as a Condition. But, in a po&s;itive View of the Ca&s;e, 'twas intirely <HI>ac|cording to God's Mercy, according to his own Purpo&s;e and Grace.</HI> His own <HI>Mercy</HI> was all his Motive to <HI>&s;aving</HI> them: and his <HI>own Purpo&s;e</HI> his only Rule in Di&s;pen&s;ing his Grace.&mdash;Again, we read, 1 Cor. 4. 7. <HI>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what ha&s;t thou, that thou did&s;t not receive? Now if thou did&s;t receive it, why do&s;t thou glory</HI> [or boa&s;t] <HI>as though thou had&s;t not received it</HI>?&mdash;So Rom. 4. 2, &amp;c. <HI>If</HI> Abraham <HI>were ju&s;tified by Works, be hath whereof to glory; but not be|fore God.&mdash;To him that worketh, is the Reward not reckoned of Grace, but of Debt.&mdash;To him that worketh not, but believeth on Him who ju&s;tifieth</HI>

<HI>the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;Unto them God im|puteth Righteou&s;ne&s;s without Works.</HI>&mdash;Again, Rom. 3. 27. <HI>Where is Boa&s;ting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of works! Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</HI> And Chap. 11. 6. <HI>If by Grace, then it is no more of Works; otherwi&s;e Grace is no more Grace.

<P>It appears to me exceeding evident from the&s;e and other parallel Texts, that with a View to the <HI>Exclu&s;ion</HI> of all <HI>Glorying</HI> or <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> in and of our&s;elves, the <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate mu&s;t be under|&s;tood, as con&s;ider'd under &s;ome certain <HI>Notion, Relation,</HI> or <HI>Quality,</HI> to be <HI>excluded</HI> from the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Recovery out of a peri&s;hing State of Nature into a State of <HI>Salvation,</HI> i. e. a ju&s;tify'd and &s;anctfi|fy'd State. For, <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> is &s;aid to be excluded, <HI>Not by the Law of Works,</HI> but by the Law of <HI>Faith.</HI> However, <HI>do we make void the Law through Faith? God forbid! Yea, we e&s;tabli&s;h the Law.</HI> Certain|ly therefore <HI>Works</HI> are not excluded as to their general <HI>Being,</HI> or in Re&s;pect of our moral <HI>Obligation</HI> to them; but the Law &s;trictly requires them of every Man. And hence it is a clear Con&s;equence, that &s;ince the <HI>Law</HI> is not made void through Faith, therefore the Exclu&s;ion of Works by the Go&s;pel mu&s;t be taken in &s;ome qualified and limited Sen&s;e, and mu&s;t re&s;pect the&s;e <HI>Works</HI> as con&s;ider'd under &s;ome certain &s;pecial <HI>Notion, Relation,</HI> or imagin'd <HI>Quality.</HI>&mdash;And what can the&s;e be?

Of their being an appointed <HI>Condition</HI> in the Go&s;pel-Covenant, and having the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of &s;pecial Grace made to them.&mdash;The&s;e are &s;ome of the mi&s;taken Notions or Re&s;pects, under which the unrege|nerate

<P>The Truth of this may be evine'd from &s;undry Con&s;iderations, As,</P>
<P N="1">1. From Scripture-Repre&s;entations of the End de&s;ign'd in the Ex|clu&s;ion of <HI>Works,</HI> viz. that <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> may be <HI>excluded.</HI>&mdash;By the Texts before cited, it appears, that <HI>Works</HI> are <HI>excluded</HI> for the &s;ake of ex|cluding <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI>: and if &s;o, it mu&s;t be concluded, the De&s;ign is to exclude them under <HI>every Notion,</HI> which contains the Grounds, of or leaves Room for <HI>Boa&s;ting.</HI> By Con&s;equence, it mu&s;t be the Inten|tion of the Holy Gho&s;t to exclude them under the Notion of their being <HI>morally good,</HI> in the &s;ight of God; &s;ince <HI>Works,</HI> con&s;ider'd in this View, do contain evident Grounds of <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> or at lea&s;t evi|dently leave Room for it; Moral Rectitude being the very Image of God, which was the primitive Glory of Man, and the highe&s;t Excellency that can be attributed to any Doings of the Creature.&mdash;It were ab&s;urd, to a&s;&s;ert that the Scripture &s;hould exclude <HI>Works</HI> for the &s;ake of excluding <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> and yet at the &s;ame time to &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="006010_0043_1027722619FC34D8">
it allows them to have any true <HI>Moral Goodne&s;s</HI> in them; &s;ince in this Ca&s;e the de&s;ign would be fru&s;tated, and <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> would by no means be excluded, though <HI>Works</HI> were under every ether Notion, but this excluded. Accordingly we find, that the Holy Gho&s;t by the Pen of the Apo&s;tle, in all that he &s;ays on this Subject in the places above cited, &s;hews it plainly to be his De&s;ign and Drift, to exclude <HI>Works,</HI> as con&s;ider'd under this mi&s;taken Notion of their having in them <HI>Moral Goodne&s;s,</HI> or true Holine&s;s, in the &s;ight of God. Thus when the Apo&s;tle u&s;es &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, <HI>By Grace ye are &s;av|ed,&mdash;not of Works;&mdash;Not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done,</HI> &amp;c. his Meaning can't be, to deny that he or others then in a re|new'd State had before their Conver&s;ion done any <HI>Works</HI> what&s;oe|ver, that were <HI>materially</HI> good, &s;uch as praying and the like com|manded Duties; but to di&s;claim the <HI>formal Goodne&s;s</HI> of them, and deny them to have <HI>true Morality</HI> in God's Account, or any &s;uch Con|formity to his righteous Law, as makes them plea&s;ing to Him; which the Pride and Ignorance of the fallen Creature flutter him with vain Imaginations of.&mdash;All <HI>Works</HI> therefore of the Unregenerate, as con|&s;ider'd under this Notion of being <HI>morally good,</HI> mu&s;t by the Go&s;pel be utterly <HI>excluded,</HI> in Order that hereby all Grounds of <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> might be remov'd, and no Place left for it in the Scheme of Man's Salvation.&mdash;Let it be ob&s;erv'd now,</P>
<P N="2">2. That all Works of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be of a true <HI>moral</HI> Complexion, as alone de&s;cribed, are the very <HI>Works,</HI> which the Scripture clearly points out as de&s;ign'd to be <HI>excluded,</HI> for the &s;ake of excluding <HI>Boa&s;ting.</HI> Here it may &s;uffice to cite two or three plain Texts. Thus, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 5. <HI>Even when we were dead in Sins, be hath quickned us together with Chri&s;t.</HI> (<HI>By Grace ye are &s;aved.</HI>) The Sin|ner's being brought into a State of Salvation is here, in the &s;tronge&s;t Language, intirely re&s;olved into Divine <HI>Grace</HI>: and in like Language the &s;ame Apo&s;tle declares it to be <HI>not of our &s;elves,&mdash;not of Works,</HI> ver. 8, 9. And agreeably in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 6. <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Works are op|po&s;ed</HI> to each other, as incompatible in this Affair. Now that <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, pretended to be of a &s;piritual and moral Cha|racter, are comprehended here, and de&s;ignedly by the Apo&s;tle ex|cluded from the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their being brought into a <HI>&s;aved</HI> State, appears evidently, by his fetching an Argument, for the Illu&s;tration of Divine Grace, from their <HI>antecedent</HI> State, which he de&s;cribes as a State of &s;piritual or moral <HI>Death</HI>: and this carries in it the &s;tronge&s;t Implication of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">apacity to do <HI>Works</HI> truly <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual</HI> The&s;e <HI>Works</HI> then, to pre&s;erve the Force of the Apo&s;tle's Rea&s;oning, we mu&s;t under&s;tand to be here meant by him, when he

tells them, that their Salvation was not <HI>of Works.</HI>&mdash;And this Con|&s;truction may be enforc'd, by con&s;idering the <HI>End,</HI> for which (as he ob&s;erves) <HI>Works</HI> are excluded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 9. <HI>Not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould Boa&s;t.</HI> Upon which it immediately follows, <HI>For we are God's Workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works.</HI>&mdash;Salvation cannot be <HI>of Works,</HI> any <HI>good Works</HI> what&s;oever; becau&s;e none truly &s;uch in God's Account can po&s;&s;ibly <HI>precede</HI> Salvation begun, in this being <HI>created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI>&mdash;Though in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;age the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of <HI>Works</HI> indefinitely, yet the <HI>End</HI> he a&s;&s;igns for their Exclu&s;ion, Di&s;covers a particular Reference to &s;uch as are of a <HI>lau|dable</HI> A&s;pect, and &s;uppo&s;ed by the Doers of them to be <HI>morally Good</HI> in the Account of God. El&s;e what Grounds of <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> could be pretended?&mdash;However, to intimate the moral &s;pecifick Difference there is between the be&s;t Duties done <HI>before</HI> Conver&s;ion, and the &s;ame done <HI>after,</HI> he di&s;tingui&s;hes the latter by a peculiar <HI>Epithet,</HI> and in|titles them <HI>Good Works.</HI> And the Force of the Argument here, to confirm his Point, lies chiefly in this, That <HI>good Works</HI> (truly &s;uch) are <HI>&s;ub&s;equent Fruits</HI> of Salvation already begun in the Soul: and therefore they cannot either in the Nature of Things, by their own Efficiency, be the productive Cau&s;e of it; nor yet in the Scheme of the Go&s;pel, by Divine Appointment, be the <HI>Covenant-Condition</HI> of it; nor by virtue of any relative or intrin&s;ick Excellency in them, be the <HI>moving</HI> Con&s;ideration with God to be&s;tow it; becau&s;e in either of the&s;e Views of them, an <HI>Antecedency</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed, that is repug|nant to the Scripture, which dates their Exi&s;tence, not before, but <HI>after</HI> Conver&s;ion. <HI>For we are his Workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works.</HI></P>
<P>Now can there be any Shadow of a rea&s;onable Ground to doubt, whether the Apo&s;tle, where he rejects the Notion of Salvation's being <HI>of Works</HI> (&s;o far as it re&s;pects its Beginning at lea&s;t) intends &s;uch <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, as they are apt fondly to imagine are of the &s;ame <HI>moral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd</HI> and <HI>excellent Quality</HI> with tho&s;e that Believers are &s;aid to be <HI>created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto,</HI> which the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>good Works,</HI> and which are &s;o indeed, being in point of Principle and End and Manner, as well as Matter, truly (though imperfectly) confor|mable to the Nature and Will of God, the Rule and Pattern of moral <HI>Goodne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;Surely it were unworthy the Character of an in|&s;pir'd Apo&s;tle, to make him &s;o weak and incon&s;i&s;tent a Rea&s;oner, as to argue, that Salvation is <HI>not of Works,</HI> becau&s;e otherwi&s;e <HI>Boa&s;t|ing</HI> were <HI>not excluded</HI>; and yet all the while to have his Eye here, not to &s;uch <HI>Works</HI> as Men flatter them&s;elves with the Suppo&s;ition of a <HI>Moral Goodne&s;s</HI> in, and which only can be imagin'd to carry in them
<PB N="47" REF="006010_0045_1027722C26F6DA80">
any Grounds of <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> but to others of a quite different Kind, that can be &s;uppo&s;ed to afford no po&s;&s;ible Pretext for this <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI>; for the &s;ake of <HI>excluding</HI> which, the Apo&s;tle declares <HI>Works</HI> exclu|ded! &mdash; We mu&s;t therefore, were it only in Reverence to the in&s;pir'd Writer, conclude, that when he &s;huts out <HI>Works</HI> from hav|ing a Hand in beginning the Salvation of a Sinner, he means to exclude <HI>all Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, whatever <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> or moral Excellence they may conceive to be in them.</P>
<P>I would &s;ubjoin here; If I mi&s;take not, there are the&s;e two or three Things will clearly follow from the Tenor and Scope of the Apo&s;tle's Argumentation.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That all <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> on the Part of the Unregenerate, is &s;o founded on that fal&s;e Hypothe&s;is of their Capacity to do (in their pre&s;ent State) Works <HI>morally good,</HI> holy or &s;piritual, in God's Ac|count, as that the <HI>excluding</HI> of <HI>Works,</HI> under that Notion or Re&s;pect will effectually exclude them under every Notion or Re&s;pect, that implies any the lea&s;t Ground for <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI>; or, which amounts to the &s;ame Thing, will effectually exclude all <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> in that Ca&s;e.&mdash;And this will appear, if we con&s;ider (1.) That it is manife&s;tly the Apo&s;tle's De&s;ign here, &s;o to exclude <HI>Works,</HI> as by that Means to exclude all <HI>Boa&s;ting.</HI> Says he. <HI>Not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould Boa&s;t</HI>: q. d. Not of <HI>Works,</HI> con&s;ider'd under any Notion whatever that contains in it Grounds of <HI>Boa&s;ting.</HI>&mdash;And (2)That with this View, he &s;ets him&s;elf to prove, that <HI>good Works,</HI> truly &s;uch, are <HI>con&s;equential</HI> to Regeneration, and &s;o an <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> Suppo&s;ition <HI>before</HI> it. Thus his Rea&s;o|nings &s;tand in Connection:&mdash;<HI>Not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould Boa&s;t. For we are God's Workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works.</HI> This proves, that when he u&s;es the exclu&s;ive Phra&s;e, <HI>Not of Works,</HI> he mu&s;t have his Eye to &s;uch <HI>Works</HI> only, as being &s;uppo&s;ed to have in them the true Excellency of <HI>good Works,</HI> do under that Notion contain Grounds of <HI>Boa&s;ting.</HI> And now to &s;hew, that in the Go&s;pel-Scheme of <HI>Salvation</HI> there's no Room left for any &s;uch <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> he de&s;troys the very <HI>Notion</HI> on which this is founded, by a&s;&s;uring us that Works truly <HI>good</HI> do <HI>follow</HI> Conver&s;ion, or the new <HI>Creation in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> and therefore can never have Place in an <HI>unregenerate</HI> State. This View of his Rea&s;oning makes it clo&s;e, and effectual to cut off <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI>: but to take it in any other View, not con&s;i&s;tent with this, will (for ought I can &s;ee) leave it loo&s;e, incoherent, and utterly in|conclu&s;ive to his Purpo&s;e; which it were mo&s;t unworthy and ab|&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e in the Ca&s;e of an Apo&s;tle, writing under divine In&s;piration.&mdash;Be&s;ides, this Argument may be &s;trengthen'd by con&s;i|dering (as before &s;ugge&s;ted) the <HI>Nature of Things.</HI> For, <HI>&s;eeing mo|ral
<PB N="48" REF="006010_0046_1027722DAE500888">
Goodne&s;s</HI> is the true Excellency of human Nature and human Ac|tions, if <HI>that</HI> be deny'd ia the Ca&s;e of an Unregenerate Man, what Grounds are le&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch an one of <HI>glorying</HI> in him&s;elf, or <HI>boa&s;ting</HI> in any Efforts of his own towards Salvation? So that the Apo&s;tle here, methinks, appears as a Ma&s;ter-Workman indeed; at one Blow &s;trik|ing Death at the Root of all <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> in this Affair of <HI>obtaining the Salvation which is by Cri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> For how is it po&s;&s;ible, in the Na|ture of Things, that <HI>Works</HI> de&s;titute of all true moral Excellency, &s;hould by any <HI>Efficacy</HI> of theirs be productive of &s;aving Conver&s;ion, or ingenerate moral Goodne&s;s id Men!

<P>But I proceed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">other Ob&s;ervation, referring to the <HI>Apo&s;tle's Rea&s;oning</HI> here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> That from this it mu&s;t follow,</P>

To &s;uppo&s;e them excluded under every other Notion whatever, but not under this, would therefore not an&s;wer the <HI>End</HI> aim'd at in their Exclu&s;ion, which is to &s;hut out all <HI>Boa&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P>(3.) It will hence clearly follow, that every <HI>Scripture-In&s;tance</HI> of excluding <HI>Works</HI> for the &s;ake of excluding <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> mu&s;t de&s;ign to exclude them under this Notion, as vainly imagin'd to be <HI>morally Good</HI> before God: &s;ince (as we have &s;een before) 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, that <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> in that Ca&s;e &s;hould otherwi&s;e be excluded.</P>
<P>But to go on to another <HI>Text</HI> of Scripture.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Truth I am defending, is clearly held forth, I think, in tho&s;e other Words above-quoted from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 7. <HI>Who maketh thee to dif|fer from another? And what ha&s;t thou, that thou did&s;t not receive? Now if thou did&s;t receive it, why do&s;t thou glory</HI> (or boa&s;t) <HI>as though thou had&s;t not received it</HI>? The <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of the Apo&s;tle here appears to me
<PB N="49" REF="006010_0047_1027723102AACCE0">
very much the &s;ame, as in the former Text; namely, to cut off all Pretences for <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> (whether of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Profe&s;&s;ors, or their Teachers) in their re&s;pective Attainments, under the Advantages of the Go&s;pel, either in point of &s;pecial Grace, or extraordinary Gifts. And the <HI>Median</HI> he makes U&s;e of here, is for Sub&s;tance the &s;ame too; namely, the &s;hutting out <HI>Works,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to have moral Worthine&s;s it them, from being die procuring Cau&s;e of their At|tainments, and re&s;olving them into the &s;overeign Plea&s;ure of the <HI>Divine Donor;</HI> to whom they &s;tood Debtors for all their Receipts.&mdash;Here are two Que&s;tions or Demands. The Fir&s;t is <HI>Who maketh thee to differ</HI>? To which the An&s;wer, here plainly imply'd, is, That Di|vine Benefactor, who is the &s;overeign Author of every good and perfect Gift. It's He, that puts the <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> upon Men, when they excell others in valuable Attainments 'Tis the Re&s;ult of his free Favour, 'Tis not any antecedent moral Excellency in any thus di&s;tingui&s;h'd, that <HI>makes the Difference</HI>: Or in Scripture-Language, <HI>Not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which they have done</HI>&mdash;The other Que&s;tion is, <HI>What ha&s;t thou, that thou did&s;t not recieve</HI> q. d. The&s;e your di&s;tingui&s;hing Attainments under the Go&s;pel in which you are. &s;o apt to glory, are you not indebted for them to the <HI>Father of Lights</HI> and <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> who has freely given them to you! Whether as to &s;anctifying Grace, or extraordinary Gifts, are you not a meer <HI>Receiver!</HI> Had you Power in your &s;elf to acquire them; or Me|rit, to purcha&s;e them! Or with regard to <HI>&s;pecial Grace,</HI> had you even any <HI>antecedent</HI> moral or &s;piritual Excellency, to intitle you to it! Surely, you mu&s;t confe&s;s, It is <HI>not of Works.</HI> For you could do None <HI>worthy of God,</HI> before you <HI>receiv'd</HI> his &s;pecial Grace: And here you was a meer <HI>Receiver,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to any Right whatever, or active Acquirement, on your part. You are in every re&s;pect wholly a <HI>Docter</HI> to the ab&s;olute Grace of the Divine Given.&mdash;Thus, tak|ing the Apo&s;tle's <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> in this its natural and un&s;ore'd Meaning, there appears in it a ju&s;t. Foundation for his Conclu&s;ion, which fol|lows, by way of Query again,&mdash;<HI>Now if thou did&s;t receive it why then do&s;t thou glory, as If thou did&s;t not receive it!</HI> A very clo&s;e Expo&s;tula|tion, and carrying in it Matter of full Conviction to the Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience of tho&s;e he wrote to, that they had no po&s;&s;ible Room left for <HI>boa&s;ting</HI> on the Account of any their di&s;tingui&s;hing Attainments. It's good Argument why Men &s;hould not glory in any Gifts of <HI>Nature,</HI> or common <HI>Providence,</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e are what they have <HI>re|ceived.</HI> But &s;urely the&s;e were not the only, nor the principal Things, that the Apo&s;tle mo&s;t probably had in his Eye, or that the <HI>Corinthi|an</HI> &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oa&s;ted in. And though <HI>extraordinary Gifts,</HI> of the &s;uperna|tural

and miraculous kind, are included here; yet certainly <HI>&s;peci|al Grace</HI> is by no Means to be thought excluded, as &s;ome pretend. For how would this comport with the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Rea&s;oning and with his main De&s;ign here? Would not a proud Elation of Mind in any under the View of a &s;uppo&s;ed moral Goodne&s;s in their Endeavours to get <HI>&s;pecial Grace,</HI> be as really in the Apo&s;tle's Sen&s;e <HI>Glorying</HI> or <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> as an undue Lifting-up them&s;elves under the View of their Endeavours to acquire tho&s;e extraordinary <HI>Gifts</HI>? And is not the at|taining of <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> by the Creature's own Doings, rather higher Ground of <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> than what appears in the other Ca&s;e; by how much 'tis of a more excellent Nature and &s;uperior Importance? If the one's being <HI>received</HI> is a Con&s;ideration &s;ufficient to &s;ilence all <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> in that Particular, why &s;hould not the &s;ame Con&s;ideration be allowed equal Force in the Ca&s;e of the other, which is as much <HI>re|ceived</HI> al&s;o? Surelv, by Parity of Rea&s;on, at lea&s;t, the Apo&s;tle's Re|buke to the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Boa&s;ter is applicable to the Ca&s;e of <HI>glorying</HI> in an imagin'd <HI>moral Goodne&s;s</HI> of unregenerate Men's Endeavours to attain <HI>converting Grace.</HI> For any, upon a &s;uppos'd Attainment of this Grace, to a&s;cribe it to an imaginary moral Excellency in his own Efforts, while unregenerate, &s;eems evidently to be a <HI>glorying in it, as though be received it not</HI>; and &s;o brings him under the Correction of the Apo&s;tle's <HI>Rod,</HI> as here exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Truth, as it appears to me, is (1.) That all <HI>Works</HI> morally good and approvable before God, are utterly <HI>impracticable</HI> by the fallen Creature, whil&s;t unrenewed, and under the Dominion of Sin; as, Sir, you concede the Subject of our pre&s;ent Controver&s;y to be.&mdash;And (2.)

under that Idea:&mdash;From the&s;e &s;everal Con&s;iderations &s;aid to|gether, I &s;hall take it at pre&s;ent for a Point fully prov'd, <HI>That all Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, &s;uppo&s;ed to have the &s;aid idea an|nexed to them, are under that Notion certainly <HI>excluded,</HI> for the &s;ake of excluding <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> from the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Sinners being bro't into a State of Salvation.&mdash;The other Point propo&s;ed was&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">[2.] That all <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, done by them whil&s;t &s;uch, and re&s;pected by them as morally good, being thus <HI>excluded,</HI> it is a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence, That they can't po&s;&s;ibly be included in the <HI>Covenant-Promi&s;e,</HI> as reveal'd <HI>Conditions,</HI> upon the Performance of which, God has engag'd to confer <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> upon Sinners.&mdash; This appears to me a genuine and clear Inference from what has been &s;aid.

<P>I an&s;wer.

<P>OBJECT. 3. <HI>That I &s;eem &s;ometimes to in&s;inuate, as if the Opinion held by</HI> you <HI>in this Matter were too nearly connected with the Doctrine of</HI> Merit; <HI>though you have expre&s;ly renounced all Pretence of</HI> Merit <HI>in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and therefore (as you imagine) are far from teaching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;etting up that</HI> Boa&s;ting, <HI>which the Go&s;pel de&s;igns to</HI> exclude&mdash;</P>
<P>To this I reply, in the following Ob&s;ervations,</P>

intire Exclu&s;ion of <HI>Boa&s;ting.</HI> For, as we have &s;een, there are <HI>other Notions</HI> of the&s;e Works, that contain Grounds of <HI>Boa&s;ting</HI> (in the Apo&s;tle's Sen&s;e) be&s;ides that of their being <HI>meritorious</HI>: And it is the evident De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel to exclude <HI>Works</HI> under <HI>every</HI> No|tion of them, that (being admitted) would let in <HI>Boa&s;ting.</HI>&mdash;How|ever, in Order to a more full an&s;wering the Objection, it &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Word <HI>Merit</HI> is variou&s;ly to be under&s;tood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ner in a <HI>high</HI> and &s;trict, or in a <HI>lower</HI> and more <HI>large</HI> Sen&s;e.

I think, you mu&s;t intend the <HI>lower</HI> Kind of Merit, or Merit in the <HI>large</HI> Sen&s;e, when you <HI>exclude</HI> it from the Works of the Unregene|rate. Now by this Kind of <HI>Merit,</HI> I conceive, mu&s;t be intended at lea&s;t &s;ome moral Excellency, true Worthine&s;s, Goodne&s;s, or Virtue in their Works, before God. And is this, Sir, the <HI>Merit,</HI> which you renounce? Is the Exclu&s;ion of this Kind of <HI>Merit</HI> the ju&s;t Import of your Expre&s;&s;ions, where you tell us (P. 24.) <HI>In his</HI> (i.e. Chri&s;t's <HI>Right we mu&s;t plead</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> for &s;pecial Grace) <HI>who has purcha&s;ed this Benefit for us; and not in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do, which we can only humbly con&s;ider as meer Qualifications,</HI> &amp;c. Do you (I &s;ay) really mean here to di&s;claim all Pretence of Merit, in the lowe&s;t and large&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word, as above explain'd? If &s;o, I an&s;wer then, there mu&s;t be a palpable <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> in your Scheme: Since you &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t, throughout your Letter, that God in di&s;pen&s;ing his <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> acts not in the Character of an ab&s;olute Proprietor or &s;overeign Benefactor, at perfect Liberty to give or to withhold the Benefit as he plea&s;eth, but only <HI>in the Capa|city of a moral Governor and righteous Judge of the Behaviour and Im|provements of his Creatures,</HI> and di&s;pen&s;ing it or not <HI>according to their Conduct in the U&s;e of the Talent they've receiv'd.</HI> Now, if this be &s;o,. I beg to be inform'd what that <HI>Behaviour of the Creature</HI> is, according to you, which is thus the Rule of God's Di&s;pen&s;ation in this Matter. Can it be any other than a true <HI>moral</HI> Behaviour, in its formal Na|ture, plea&s;ing to God? Is it po&s;&s;ible that the <HI>Creature's Behaviour</HI>

or at lea&s;t, you mu&s;t allow, this leaves large Room for it, and lay in the Sinner's Way a powerful Temptation to this Soul-ruining moral Evil.&mdash;Upon the&s;e Grounds, I leave it (Sir) with you to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly whether you are not, &s;o far as you have been &s;etting up and pleading for this <HI>Opinion</HI> and this <HI>Character</HI> of the Un|regenerate Man's Doings, ju&s;tly chargeable with &s;etting up and pleading for that &s;ame <HI>Boa&s;ting,</HI> which the Go&s;pel-Scheme of Salva|tion has mo&s;t ab&s;olutely <HI>excluded,</HI> or deny'd any Place to in this Affair: as we have &s;een from a Variety of <HI>Scriptures.</HI> And the Con&s;truction I have made of the &s;acred Text, I doubt not might ea&s;ily be confirm'd from the <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Homilies</HI> of your own Church, from the concurrent Sen&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h Reformers,</HI> from the publick Confe&s;&s;ions of the <HI>foreign</HI> Prote&s;tant Churches, &amp;c. which would all come in as a <HI>Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es</HI> on my Side of the Que&s;tion.

<P N="1">1. Not under the Notion of their being <HI>acceptable</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> to God; becau&s;e there is no Foundation in <HI>Truth</HI> for &s;uch a Notion of them.&mdash;For the Scripture mo&s;t expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ures us, Rom. 8.8. <HI>They that are in the Fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God.</HI> By them that are in the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> I under&s;tand, not meerly the <HI>ob&s;tinate relentle&s;s Sinner,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>the Man</HI> you de&s;cribe, <HI>who</HI> though <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly concerned to become</HI> renew|ed in the Spirit of his Mind, <HI>yet is not throughly converted from Sin to God,</HI> &s;uch an one, <HI>not having the Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;till <HI>in the Fle&s;h</HI> or under the Government of a <HI>fle&s;hly Mind.</HI> Whatever <HI>fair Shew in the Fle&s;h</HI> he make, yet under all his <HI>&s;eemingly Religiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is in Truth <HI>carnally minded</HI>: The <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> is his predominant Principle.

<P>I beg Leave, Sir, before I fini&s;h, to offer &s;ome Hints on a <HI>Text,</HI> you have pre&s;s'd into your Service, which has hitherto e&s;caped my Notice.

Yet indeed there is not the lea&s;t Colour for &s;uch a Con&s;truction of the Words, neither from the Text not Con|text. There is a total Silence here, as to the Ca&s;e of an <HI>Unrege|nerate</HI> Man.&mdash;So there is with regard to the Sinner's <HI>working</HI> be|ing, <HI>conditional</HI> of God's <HI>working.</HI> Nay, the Contrary appears, in as much as <HI>God's</HI> working is here con&s;idered as <HI>prior</HI> to Man's working, and (as &s;uch) urged as a <HI>Motive</HI> to it.&mdash;Neither is there any Mention made here of <HI>converting Grace,</HI> nor mu&s;t we nece&s;|&s;arily conceive <HI>fir&s;t Grace</HI> to be intended here by the <HI>Salvation</HI> &s;poken of: but it may as properly mean <HI>progre&s;&s;ive</HI> Salvation here, and <HI>compleat</HI> Salvation hereafter: in which Views the Word is often u&s;ed, and is &s;o in this Epi&s;tle. (Chap. 1. 19, 28.)&mdash;Nor is the <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> here mentioned, &s;uch as is common to the Unregenerate, but may as well, and doubtle&s;s doth, intend a <HI>filial</HI> Reverence and <HI>godly</HI> Fear, peculiar to true Chri&s;tians. &mdash; And the Exhortation here is expre&s;ly directed to tho&s;e whom the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>his Beloved,</HI> and of whom he &s;ays they had <HI>always obeyed.</HI> A &s;ure Sign, he did not here addre&s;s &s;uch as he &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Un|regenerate.</HI>&mdash;And the Argument he u&s;es to enforce it, is, <HI>For it is God that worketh in you,</HI> &amp;c. Which runs not directly in the Form of <HI>a Promi&s;e,</HI> but &s;eems only a Declaration of Fact: <HI>q. d.</HI> It is the De&s;ign of God's <HI>working in you,</HI> as he has done, and the proper Improve|ment you &s;hould make of <HI>Grace received,</HI> is, to put you upon Endeavours after progre&s;&s;ive Sanctification, and taking Pains for the <HI>Furtherance of your Salvation.</HI>&mdash;Yet the Words may implicitly couch in them a <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> but it is to <HI>Saints in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI>&mdash;Nor would I be un|der&s;tood here to deny, that this Text may &s;everal Ways be adapted and apply'd for Excitation and Encouragement to the <HI>&s;eeking &s;tri|ving Sinner,</HI> and e&s;pecially for the promoting his <HI>Humiliation,</HI> by a Conviction of his own &s;piritual Impotence, and the Sovereignty

It being a Ca&s;e, in which any the lea&s;t <HI>Probability,</HI> yea, a bare <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of Succe&s;s is infinite|ly more valuable, than in any other Ca&s;e imaginable; and a Ca&s;e, where <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> calls aloud for their mo&s;t ardent De&s;ires, their mo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant <HI>Strivings to enter in at the &s;trait Gate,</HI> their utmo&s;t Pains in <HI>pre&s;&s;ing into the Kingdom of God.</HI>&mdash; Was the <HI>Man-&s;layer</HI> under the Law &s;ure of Succe&s;s, and yet was he not wont to free with all his Might to the City of Refuge? And &s;hould not the awak|ened Sinner, though wuhout a Promi&s;e of certain Succe&s;s, yet upon the Encouragement of a <HI>Probability,</HI> or even a meer <HI>Po&s;&s;i|bility, flee for Refuge to lay Hold on the Hope &s;et before Him</HI>?&mdash;Did not the <HI>Ninevites</HI> act meerly upon the Encouragement of a <HI>Who can tell if God will return</HI>!&mdash;And the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> were they not Stimulated by an uncertain Hope, &s;aying, <HI>Who knoweth if God will repent, and leave a Ble&s;&s;ing behind him</HI>!&mdash;Once more, when an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle had an hypocritical Profe&s;&s;or of the Go&s;pel in Dealing, I mean <HI>Simon,</HI> whom he perceived to be in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bond of Iniquity, with what Encour|agement doth he enforce his Exhortation to him to <HI>repent,</HI> and <HI>pray to God</HI>? Doth he tell him of a <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> and urge his Endeavours

as <HI>conditions,</HI> in the Manner that you do? No, Sir, but he puts all to the Ri&s;que; he mentions but a <HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="8 letters">e.&mdash;Pray God, if perhaps He may forgive thee.</HI>&mdash; This <HI>Perhaps,</HI> as here u&s;ed, imports indeed only a Su&s;picion of the Truth of the Man's Repentance, and not any Doubt of God's Forgivene&s;s in Ca&s;e his Repentance were &s;incere.&mdash;Note, Sir, We have here a plain Scripture Exam|ple of a Profe&s;&s;or &s;till <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> and under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin; and of the Encouragement, which the Go&s;pel gives to &s;uch an one, when awakened, to cry to God for Mercy. The Apo&s;tle only mentions a <HI>Perhaps</HI>; and never li&s;p to him the mo&s;t di&s;tant Surmi&s;e of a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> to &s;ecure certain Succe&s;s. Now in this, will you &s;ay of in In&s;pired Apo&s;tle, that he took the ready Method <HI>to cut the Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of</HI> Simon's <HI>Endeavours to repent</HI>!&mdash;I hope &s;urely, in this Ca&s;e you will &s;ay No &mdash; What then is the <HI>Divinity</HI> you teach, in this Particular! Is it not too near akin to that <HI>vain Philo&s;ophy,</HI> you &s;o loudly exclaim again&s;t? Or, is not the Language of your Objection in this Ca&s;e, too agreeable to that of the <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ful Man,</HI> who in Excu&s;e of his Aver&s;ion to taking any Pains without Certainty of Succe&s;s, &s;ays on every Occa&s;ion, <HI>There is e Lion in the Way!</HI></P>
<P>But, Sir, however tho&s;e on your Side of the Que&s;tion may un|dervalue any Go&s;pel-Encouragement, &s;hort of a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> a&s;certain|ing the Succe&s;s of a Sinner's Endeavours; Yet we on the other hand are con&s;trained, in the View of the glorious Encourage|ments of the Go&s;pel (though from meer Sovereign Mercy, un|promi&s;ed to any Endeavours of the Unregenerate) to admire the Wi&s;dom of God in the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> &s;o adapted to the De&s;ign of exalting his own <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> and &s;ecuring the Honours of his <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> together, and &s;o adapted to promote at the &s;ame Time both the <HI>Humiliation</HI> and the <HI>Encouragement</HI> of the fallen Creature: Equally calculated to awaken the Sinner's Fear of God's Wrath, and to &s;upport a Hope in his Mercy, &s;o, to guard him again&s;t the Dangers of Security, Pre&s;umption, and Delay, on the one hand, and on the other again&s;t all Temptations to De&s;pair and Dejection.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have fini&s;hed what I propo&s;ed on this Occa&s;ion.&mdash;I am con&s;cious of much Infirmity, and ask your Candour. I think, I can &s;ay uprightly, I have not committed any wilful Mi&s;takes: but have wrote in the Fear of God, the very Sen&s;e of my Heart, according to my be&s;t Light.</P>
<P>On the whole, I would ju&s;t make the one Remark, and be it remember'd: Though I deny any <HI>Pormi&s;e,</HI> by virtue of which
<PB N="77" REF="006010_0075_1027728D772848F8">
the <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> of God can po&s;&s;ibly become <HI>due</HI> to the Prayers and Endeavours of the Unregenerate, whil&s;t &s;uch; Yet however, in I am per&s;waded, that it is the Duty of Sinners to be &s;eeking and &s;triving after it; and that not a &s;ingle In&s;tance will be found of any Sinner in the Day of Judgment able to &s;tand forth, and plead in Truth, <HI>Lord, I did my be&s;t Endeavour to the very la&s;t, that I might obtain the Salvation which is by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and looked diligently lest I should fall of the Grace of God but after all was deny'd</HI>&mdash; To be per&s;wa|ded of this <HI>Fact</HI> on the Score of the Riches of God's Mercy, and yet at the &s;ame Time to renounce all Pretence of a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> to the Sinner's Endeavours, appear to me Things very well con&s;i&s;tent. Though, guided by the Word, I limit the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of God to the Believer: Yet far be it from me, to entertain a Thought of limiting Him in his <HI>unpromi&s;ed Mercy</HI> towards Sinners, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h knows no other Bounds, in this, or any other Ca&s;e, con&s;i&s;tent with his moral Perfections, but the meer <HI>good Pleasure of his Will.</HI></P>
<P>May the Spirit of Truth leads us into all Truth; and may the Spirit of Grace make all Grace to abound towards us and in as!</P>
