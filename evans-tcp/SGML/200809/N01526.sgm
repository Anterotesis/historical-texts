<P>Their U&s;ual Pretences are,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Infinite Mercy of GOD. But GOD may be (and is) of an Infinitely Merciful Nature, and <HI>yet not be Merciful to Wicked Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors:</HI> P&s;al. 59.5. <HI>He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will &s;hew them no favour; I&s;ai.</HI> 27.11. Almighty GOD is as Infinite in Ju&s;tice, as in Mercy: and Incorrigible Sinners are fit Objects for His Ju&s;tice to be Glorify'd upon, and no longer for His Mercy &amp; Patience to be abu&s;ed
<PB N="48" REF="001812_0047_0FB83F2A4DA539A0">
by 'em: To what Purpo&s;e is it to wa&s;te any more Time upon them, who are already as Stubble fully dry, fit fewel for Unquenchable Fire? They ob&s;ti|nately per&s;evere in <HI>their Rejection of</HI> CHRIST, and of the Mercy of GOD in HIM, freely offered to 'em, &s;o that they can lay no Claim to the Di|vine Mercy, on CHRIST's account; and it's impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have it otherwi&s;e: Now if tho&s;e who are in CHRIST JESUS, and lay Claim to the Mercy of GOD by Faith, &amp; have a good Title to it, yet E&s;cape not &s;ore Temporal Puni&s;hments for their Sins, much le&s;s can Chri&s;tle&s;s Sinners ex|pect to E&s;cape. Surely GOD will Re|ject their Plea for Mercy, who ob&s;ti|nately &amp; incorrigibly Reject CHRIST and Mercy. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.24.31.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another of their u&s;ual Preten|ces is, that they will Repent of their Sins, and Believe in CHRIST JESUS afterwards: But,</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Lord they have no hope</HI>: For when the Time of De&s;troying Judgment is Come, it's too late for &s;uch as have out-&s;tood their whole Day of Grace, to expect His Salvati|on. GOD is weary of Waiting, and <HI>HIS SPIRIT will no longer strive with them.</HI> Gen. 6.3. <HI>Their Iniquity is full?</HI> The Set Time for Offers of Mercy is Ended: <HI>The LORD being Angry, is ri&s;en up, and has &s;hut the Door, they being without:</HI> Luk. 13.25. Mercy has had its long Days, and now Ju&s;tice and Fury mu&s;t have Theirs; The Days that are now Come upon 'em, are not Days of Patience, but Days of Vengeance; they have no Pro|mi&s;e, no Ground to flatter them&s;elves with Expectation that GOD will give

<P>USE. Have the Wicked no Ju&s;t Pretences to Hope for E&s;cape from De&s;truction, and horrendous Ruine, when the Day of God's Patience is Ended? And &s;hall it be ea&s;ier for <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> in the Judgment, than for the Rejecters of the Go&s;|pel, and for Rebels again&s;t the Light?
