<OPENER><SALUTE>REV^d. SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PLEASE to turn your eye on what you have wrote in the clo&s;e of your 3d page, in the 4th, and fir&s;t half of the 5th, and &s;eriou&s;ly compare it with what I told you when you was at my hou&s;e la&s;t fall. I then told you,
<Q>I had not read the whole of your Inquiry, but only &s;ome extracts &s;ent me by a Gentleman, in who&s;e faithfulne&s;s I could fully confide; from which I had given what you had read in my Dialogue.</Q>
When you &s;aid,
<Q>Mr. Mills had wrote again&s;t the doctrine I remarked upon as yours, and that you, in an&s;wering him, had an&s;wered or obviated my objections again&s;t it, and that I ought to have waited till I had &s;een your an&s;wer:</Q>
I replied,
<Q>I had not &s;een Mr. Mills's piece, and had only heard in general that he had wrote again&s;t you, but did not know till now that he had oppo&s;ed that doctrine of yours I remarked upon: And as to your an&s;wer to him, I had never heard of it before. You &s;aid it had been adverti&s;ed &s;everal months pa&s;t. I told you it might be &s;o but I had never heard any thing of the matter till now; and added, I am &s;orry I did not know of it in &s;ea&s;on, I would have waited a little to have &s;een it; but I did not tell you I was &s;orry for what I had wrote. I further added to this purpo&s;e, that I did not de&s;ign what I wrote upon your doctrine, as a full an&s;wer to all your rea&s;onings in its defence, but to make my own remarks upon it, viewing of it in various lights, not regarding whether the whole directly oppo&s;ed your rea&s;onings or not.</Q>
&mdash;I believe, Sir, you remember this conver&s;ation; I remember it well.</P>
<P>Having read the above to Mr. Chapman, he gave me the follow|ing under his hand, and I pre&s;ent it to you.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Hezekiah Chapman, of Say-Brook, waited on Mr. Hopkins to Mr. Hart's hou&s;e, as he returned from Commencement la&s;t fall, and was pre&s;ent during the fir&s;t part of their conver&s;ation. Mr. Hart having now read to me the narrative he gives Mr. Hopkins, in a letter to him, of the conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed between them at that time, I well re|member mo&s;t of it; &amp; in particular, that Mr. Hart told him, he had not &s;een or read the whole of his Inquiry, but only &s;ome extracts from it, &s;ent him by a Gentleman; that he had not &s;een Mr. Mills's piece, and did not know that he had oppo&s;ed the doctrine he re|marked upon as Mr. Hopkins's; that he had never heard till now that Mr. Hopkins was writing or publi&s;hing an an&s;wer to Mr. Mills; that he was &s;orry he did not know it &s;ooner; he would have

waited a little to have &s;een it. But I did not hear him &s;ay he was &s;orry for what he had wrote, or that he had wrote <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that doctrine. If my memory don't fail me, I al&s;o heard him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ll Mr. Hopkins, he did not de&s;ign what he wrote on that head as an an|&s;wer to his book, or to all his rea&s;ons in &s;upport of that doctrine.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>How incon&s;i&s;tent with truth is the idea you rai&s;e in your readers mind? In the pa&s;&s;ages pointed to you above, you repre&s;ent the ca&s;e to the reader, and rea&s;on upon it, as &s;uppo&s;ing it true that I knew Mr. Mills had before wrote again&s;t that doctrine of yours which I cen&s;ured as fal&s;e, and that you was publi&s;hing a reply and vindica|tion of it; and on this &s;uppo&s;ition paint me in a fal&s;e light, and flouri&s;h your colours in a characteri&s;tic manner. How could you do &s;o? You mu&s;t have &s;trangely forgot what I told you, or de|&s;ignedly impo&s;ed on your readers by giving them a very wrong view of the matter, injurious to your brother, and calculated to rai&s;e in them an unju&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t him. Do you think, Sir, our great Ma&s;ter will &s;ay to you, in re&s;pect to this,
<Q>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant?</Q>
Surely &s;uch carnal weapons of <HI>of|fence</HI> very ill become the hands of the mini&s;ters of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, Sir,
<Q>Mr. H's friend took &s;uch care not to tran&s;cribe any of my arguments for the &s;entiment I e&s;pou&s;ed, that he care|fully pa&s;&s;ed over the only &s;entence in the fir&s;t paragraph he tran&s;|cribed, which contained a rea&s;on for it, tho' he tran&s;cribed the words immediately before and after it.</Q>
(p. 5.) I told you, when at my hou&s;e, I had taken <HI>&s;ome</HI> things out of the extracts &s;ent me. I aimed to take enough to give my reader a ju&s;t idea of the doc|trine I de&s;igned to remark upon, and omitted &s;ome other things. So you don't know whether the omi&s;&s;ion you complain of was by my friend or me.&mdash;I ob&s;erve you don't cen&s;ure the extracts I pub|li&s;hed as giving a wrong repre&s;entation of your doctrine. Indeed you could not, without being condemned out of your own mouth. The reports to the contrary which have been &s;pread among the people are intirely without ground. If I had tran&s;cribed all you &s;ay upon this doctrine in your Inquiry, and an&s;wer to Mr. Mills, the doctrine would have appeared ju&s;t the &s;ame as it does in the ex|tracts I gave, except in &s;ome views of it, <HI>more exceptionable.</HI></P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e is the loud outcry you have rai&s;ed? Do you think, Sir, that a man who has been in the mini&s;try more than thirty years, and not wholly inattentive to what the <HI>&s;cripture &s;aith,</HI> is taxable with pre&s;umptuous ra&s;hne&s;s in cen&s;uring and remarking on a doctrine as fal&s;e, which you have affirmed as true, unle&s;s he has fir&s;t weighed and an&s;wered all you have &s;aid in its defence? Indeed if I had undertaken to give a particular an&s;wer to all your argu|ments in &s;upport of the error, I ought to have done it. My title
<PB N="4" REF="011678_0004_0F87C8DA6E048868">
page expre&s;&s;ed my de&s;ign: '<HI>Brief Remarks on a number of fal&s;e pro|po&s;iti<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> '&amp;c.&mdash;Indeed I intended at fir&s;t to have cen&s;ured more of your dangerous errors, and took &s;ome pains to procure your books or proper extracts out of them, but was unhappily di&s;ap|pointed, and &s;o obliged to forbear. Will you, Sir, forgive me this wrong?</P>
<P>You &s;ay, (p. 5.)
<Q>I have &s;uch an opinion of Mr. H. that I doubt not he is &s;orry for what he has done, and heartily a&s;hamed of it.</Q>
I have not &s;een cau&s;e yet, to extend my &s;orrow further than to what I mentioned to you at my hou&s;e. I am indeed &s;orry you have &s;o injuriou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented the &s;tate of facts, and hope you will be &s;o too.</P>
<P>In the next paragraph you &s;ay,
<Q>If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, How could Mr. H &s;ay he had collected a few things <HI>out of many</HI> which are faulty, when he had never &s;een any thing I had wrote, except the words he produces? I mu&s;t leave him to an&s;wer this que&s;tion.</Q>
Since you are &s;o mightily puzzled by it, I will do it.
<Q>I had been informed by more than one credible per&s;on,</Q>
(&s;ee your fifth page) yea, by more than two or three credible per&s;ons, gentlemen of good memory, judgment and integrity, who had read your Inquiry and &s;ermons, what new and &s;trange doctrines you had taught in them. On the foot of this evidence I thought I might warrantably &s;ay in general, that your writings contained many things <HI>faulty.</HI> I have &s;ince read your Inquiry and Sermons, and find I was not impo&s;ed upon, and that, as the Queen of Sheba &s;aid to Solomon, <HI>the one half was not told me.</HI></P>
<P>You quote the&s;e words, (p. 6.)
<Q>For their lu&s;ts &s;ake they bear partial enmity to the law of God;</Q>
and rea&s;on from them as tho' I here u&s;ed the word <HI>partial</HI> in a &s;en&s;e directly oppo&s;ed to <HI>total.</HI>&mdash; Don't you know, Sir, that you have here concealed my &s;entiment from your reader, and &s;ub&s;tituted a very different one in its place? Is this to u&s;e him well? If you read what preceeds and follows this little &s;crap of a &s;entence, with due attention, I think you could not but perceive I u&s;ed the word <HI>partial</HI> there, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as when we &s;ay of a corrupt judge, he is partial in his judgment. See the dialogue, p. 57, 58.</P>
<P>In your 5th page you &s;ay,
<Q>I implicitly grant that you and Dr. Whitaker are both right, if the doctrine of man's total depravity is admitted,</Q>
(you had, I believe, no warrant to &s;ay &s;o)
<Q>and that the doctrine of regeneration by the <HI>immediate</HI> operation of the Spirit of God will follow, the doctrine of total depravity being allowed.</Q>
Is this a blunder, Sir, or an in&s;tance of art? I neither denied, nor rea&s;oned again&s;t the <HI>immediate</HI> operation of the Spirit, &amp;c. but only again&s;t an operation <HI>without the word of go&s;pel truth,</HI> which you gentlemen have taught. The Spirit's operation may
<PB N="5" REF="011678_0005_0F87C8DB2EFB7740">
be immediate, and yet be <HI>with the truth.</HI> If in&s;tead of <HI>immediate,</HI> you had &s;aid the <HI>phy&s;ical, miraculous</HI> operation of the Spirit, <HI>without giving light or communicating truth</HI> to the mind, this would have been a fair and ju&s;t &s;tating of the matter.&mdash;I ob&s;erve, Sir, though you carefully avoid u&s;ing the word phy&s;ical in your writings on this &s;ubject, yet you u&s;e the word immediate in &s;uch a manner as mu&s;t convey to the di&s;cerning reader the &s;ame idea.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, &s;ir, (p. 6.)
<Q>The di&s;pute between him and me does, <HI>by his own acknowlegement,</HI> turn upon the doctrine of man's total depravity:</Q>
(a very unwarrantable a&s;&s;ertion)
<Q>And Mr. H. has no other way to oppo&s;e Dr. Whitaker or me, but by denying this doctrine.</Q>
(You are greatly mi&s;taken in this, &s;ir.)&mdash;
<Q>The doctrine of man's total corruption in his natural unrenewed &s;tate, which has been held by all &s;ound calvini&s;ts from the reformation down to this day, and is expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted by the a&s;&s;embly of divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in their confe&s;&s;ion and catechi&s;ms: This doctrine, I &s;ay, is as fal&s;e and dangerous an error as any of tho&s;e Mr. H. has oppo&s;ed in Dr. W. or me: and more &s;o if po&s;&s;ible, as the former is the foundation of the latter; &s;o that the&s;e can|not be oppo&s;ed but by oppo&s;ing that, which is <HI>really the only thing in di&s;pute.</HI></Q>
&mdash;This, &s;ir, is a very extraordinary pa&s;&s;age. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ound calvini&s;ts hold the general doctrine of man's total corruption; and that they do approve the &s;ub&s;tance of the We&s;t|min&s;ter confe&s;&s;ion and catechi&s;ms: But they are not obliged ex|actly to agree in every tittle with that a&s;&s;embly, in the explanation they give of this corruption, in order to be &s;ound calvini&s;ts, any more than with you and Dr. W. in your explanations. Howe|ver, I believe they do generally like the We&s;tmin&s;ter definition better than yours. They agree in the general doctrine of a total corruption, but their modes of explaining of it, circum&s;tantially differ; as the modes of explaining the doctrine of the trinity, u&s;ed by the trinitarians do; and yet the&s;e are all <HI>&s;ound</HI> calvini&s;ts, as the other are &s;ound trinitarians. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The mo&s;t moderate, believe that the grand principle of true piety and heavenly virtue is <HI>dead,</HI> and its root <HI>peri&s;hed</HI> in the hearts of fallen man, and that it cannot be revived, but by a new plantation of the &s;acred &s;eed, &s;ent down from heaven, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and plan|ted in the heart by the gracious influence of the holy Spirit, and &s;u|pernatural grace of God, admini&s;tred by the go&s;pel; and that there are certain &s;eeds of &s;in in the hearts of all men, or natural principles and &s;prings of action, which left to them&s;elves, uncontrouled and un|governed by grace, will <HI>infallibly</HI> produce actual &s;in, and bring forth fruit unto death; and that &s;ome of other of the pa&s;&s;ions or lu&s;ts of &s;in have in fact the a&s;cendant in every heart of man, till the heavenly &s;eed of virtue or true holine&s;s is planted by the Spirit of grace. <HI>All this is undoubtedly true.</HI>&mdash;The mo&s;t rigid calvini&s;ts profe&s;s to believe the We&s;tmin&s;ter definition of the natural corruption, <HI>ju&s;t</HI>; but it is ob&s;ervable that they, in their explanations, depart a little from the &s;trict literal &s;en&s;e of the latter clau&s;e, viz. '<HI>wholly</HI> inclined to <HI>all</HI> evil, and that <HI>continually.</HI>'</NOTE> There is a di&s;tinction to be made
<PB N="6" REF="011678_0006_0F87C8DBDECE7D68">
Sir, between <HI>&s;ound</HI> and <HI>perfect.</HI> Perhaps you are di&s;po&s;ed to com|pliment your&s;elf as a perfect Calvini&s;t: but I think if you can po&s;|&s;ibly be admitted at all as a Calvini&s;t, you ought to be e&s;teemed a <HI>corrupt</HI> one, relating to the doctrines now in view. You, &s;ir, and Dr. W. with &s;ome others among us, have carried orthodoxy to &s;uch prodigious exce&s;s that it is, in your hands, degenerated into heterodoxy. But is it not a pre&s;umptuous thing in you to &s;et up yours, and Dr. W's particular explanations of the general doctrine of the total depravity as the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> of <HI>&s;oundne&s;s</HI> in this article? What po&s;&s;ible pretence can you have for this, more than the vene|rable Mr. Baxter, Dr. Watts, Dr. Doddridge, and a thou&s;and more great names? There are, &s;ir, great numbers of &s;ound Calvini&s;ts who will never con&s;ent to lie down and be &s;tretched upon your bed. None indeed need to fear their feet will be cut off as too long.</P>
<P>But let us, &s;ir, view the &s;tandard you have implicitly &s;et up as the re&s;t of a &s;ound belief relating to the doctrine of the corruption of nature. It is this,
<Q><HI>The</HI> enmity of man's heart is levelled <HI>directly</HI> again&s;t God's <HI>whole moral character</HI> as being hateful to the natu|ral man, <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> or <HI>for its own &s;ake</HI>; that this enmity is wro't into the very frame of the human heart, and is of &s;uch a nature- and &s;o confirmed a principle, that no po&s;&s;ible applications of go&s;|pel truths to the mind and heart can &s;ubdue or weaken it: The Spirit of God him&s;elf can't overcome it by applyimg go&s;pel truth and the doctrines of grace to the heart. But on the contrary, the more a natural man &s;ees of the light and truth of God's cha|racter, the more in proportion does his hatred of it ri&s;e and exert it&s;elf.</Q>
This, &s;ir, is a ju&s;t &s;ummary of the doctrine you and Dr. W. have taught relating to the natural enmity. I know indeed you do both of you frequently contradict your&s;elves; but this doctrine comes out at la&s;t as what you hold to. I could ea&s;ily collect as large a &s;ection of <HI>&s;triking</HI> incon&s;i&s;tencies from your Inqui|ry and Sermons, as you have from the aged Mr. Mills; but that would not plea&s;e or edify the public more than your fragrant po&s;ey did.</P>
<P>But is it really as you &s;ay, that a man can't di&s;believe and oppo&s;e <HI>this</HI> doctrine concerning the <HI>enmity,</HI> but he mu&s;t di&s;believe, and con&s;equentially deny the doctrine of a <HI>total</HI> corruption? Is this latter doctrine really the <HI>only</HI> thing in di&s;pute? You could not have &s;ugge&s;ted any thing more exceptionable. You have put the controver&s;y upon a wrong foot; no &s;ound Calvini&s;t will join i&s;&s;ue with you here. The general doctrine of the total depravity is not
<PB N="7" REF="011678_0007_0F87C8DC9D4D4438">
at all in di&s;pute. Men who admit this doctrine do, and may very con&s;i&s;tently deny your doctrine concerning the nature of the en|mity: for they believe the corruption is of the moral kind, and in its nature <HI>curable</HI> by an application of that &s;upernatural doctrine of truth and grace which came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in &s;uch a manner as the holy Spirit knows how to apply it. There is an e&s;&s;ential differ|ence between your doctrine concerning the enmity, (on which that other doctrine I oppo&s;ed, is built) and their doctrine of the corrup|tion.&mdash;Indeed, &s;ir, it appears to me, that you have treated your readers very ill, in thus making them lo&s;e &s;ight of the merits of the cau&s;e, and &s;ub&s;tituting quite another thing in its place, as being, you tell them, '<HI>really the only thing in di&s;pute.</HI>' Some, no doubt, will believe you, and be filled with fervent zeal And the glory will be yours of blowing up an <HI>unhallowed</HI> flame, founded in <HI>mi&s;re|pre&s;entation.</HI> If you have mi&s;led them thro' inadvertence and without de&s;ign; I hope they will ea&s;ily forgive you this wrong: But if it was done with de&s;ign, it is artful enough, but how <HI>un|faithful!</HI></P>
<P>I hope, &s;ir, for your &s;ake, it was only a confu&s;ion in your tho'ts that cau&s;ed you &s;o wrongly to &s;tate the controver&s;y. Perhaps &s;ir, you will &s;ay, I have not told you what my &s;entiments are relating to the general doctrine of a <HI>total</HI> corruption. I have told you what they are not. I will further &s;ay, in general, I apprehend they are much nearer the Calvini&s;tic doctrine than yours are, and to the &s;criptures of truth. But you appear to have a great di&s;po&s;ition to have your readers think me an Arminian; and I &s;uppo&s;e, think you &s;hall find your account in it. I &s;uffer you to enjoy the plea|&s;ure. Perhaps I may &s;oon have opportunity to let the public know more fully what my &s;entiments are relating to the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>What you &s;ay, p. 8. I pa&s;s over as unworthy of notice &mdash; It affords a &s;triking in&s;tance of unfairne&s;s and mi&s;repre&s;entation. As &s;uch I recommend it to your &s;erious review.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, &s;ir, that in your following pages, you very carefully keep up the mi&s;repre&s;entation of the merits of the controver&s;y, which I took notice of above, and labour to per&s;uade your readers it is genuine Calvini&s;m that is oppo&s;ed as a new &s;y&s;tem of errors. In this you impo&s;e upon your readers. Some will &s;ee it, others will not.&mdash; You &s;ay, p 9.
<Q>I que&s;tion whether an author can, with a right temper and view, take this method to run any doc|trine down, by appealing to the prejudices of the people</Q>
Why then did you do &s;o? You have done it, I think, in an extraordina|ry manner.</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to cen&s;ure me very &s;everely for calling the &s;cheme of doctrines, &s;ome of which I remarked upon, a <HI>new</HI> &s;cheme. And refer to the &s;ynod of Dort, and We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;embly as
<PB N="8" REF="011678_0008_0F87C8DD5FB0A7D8">
teachers of the&s;e things, and &s;ay,
<Q>if I had called all the calvini&s;tie doctrines <HI>quite new,</HI> it would not have been more contrary to apparent fact.</Q>
p. 10, 11, 12. Some of your brethren in this &s;cheme have acknowledged it in &s;ome re&s;pects new, they &s;peak of new di&s;coveries &amp; further improvements in divinity. I heard one of them, not long &s;ince, in a public di&s;cour&s;e, after he had drawn the outlines of the <HI>new</HI> &s;cheme, apply him&s;elf to obviate the pre|judice that might ari&s;e again&s;t it as in &s;ome mea&s;ure new; and to this purpo&s;e he ob&s;erved, that new di&s;coveries &amp; further improve|ments had lately been made in philo&s;ophy, and other branches of natural &s;cience, and why &s;hould not the like be expected in divini|ty? I wi&s;h you gentlemen, had made any further improvements in <HI>true</HI> divinity.</P>
<P>If &s;ir, you had fairly repre&s;ented the doctrines I remarked upon as erroneous, you would have made but a <HI>poor</HI> figure in repre&s;ent|ing of them as the ancient and e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrines of calvini&s;m, and of the We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;embly of divines.&mdash;Suffer me &s;ir, to pre&s;ent you with a number of doctrines which belong to that &s;cheme of divinity I call a <HI>new &s;cheme.</HI> A ju&s;t &s;ummary of the doctrines concerning the enmity I have given you above. To the&s;e I add the following, viz.
<Q>Men are <HI>not converted</HI> to God&mdash; by any rational arguments, whereby <HI>their hearts are per&s;waded</HI> to turn from &s;in to God.&mdash; I don't think that regeneration is ef|fected.&mdash;by pre&s;enting the things of religion to their minds, or even by <HI>opening their eyes to &s;ee them.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Whitaker's Sermons, p. 53.</NOTE>

But prove them to be calvini&s;tic, by the We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;embly of divines, and fairly reconcile them with the following propo&s;itions delivered by them, and I will no longer call your &s;cheme <HI>new,</HI> tho' it is very corrupt and de&s;tructive.

&amp;c. In their brief &s;um of chri&s;tian doctrine, which was al&s;o received by the general a&s;&s;embly of the calvini&s;tic church of Scotland, they &s;ay, Head 3d.
<Q>The outward means for making men partakers of the covenant of grace are &s;o wi&s;ely di&s;penced as the elect &s;hall be infallibly <HI>converted</HI> and &s;aved <HI>by them.</HI> The&s;e means are 1&s;t. <HI>the word of God.</HI></Q>

(How does he effect this?)
<Q><HI>In opening their under&s;tandings,</HI> renewing their wills, affections &amp; faculties.</Q>
Surely &s;ir, this We&s;tmin&s;ter bed is &s;horter than that you can &s;tretch your&s;elf upon it; the covering is narrower than that you can decently wrap your&s;elf in it.&mdash;Perhaps you will &s;ay, Divines &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> and active con|ver&s;ion, &amp;c. Some do expre&s;s them&s;elves in this ob&s;cure, improper manner. To &s;peak more intelligibly, their is a di&s;tinction to be made between the action of the Spirit of God on the mind, in which the mind is pa&s;&s;ive as acted upon, and the action of the mind an&s;wering thereto. The We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;embly &s;peak to this purpo&s;e in their confe&s;&s;ion, chap. 10. art. 2. &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">g of God's effectual call of man, they &s;ay,
<Q>he is altogether pa&s;&s;ive therein, until being quickened and renewed by the holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to an&s;wer this call, and embrace the grace offered.</Q>
Your doctrine e&s;&s;entially differs from theirs in this; you &s;ay to this purpo&s;e, this action of the Spirit quickening or regenerating the mind, is wholly without impre&s;&s;ing on the mind any idea or &s;en&s;e of the truth, or communicating any new light to the &s;oul, a mere act of creating power, and that the truth is not u&s;ed by him at all as a means and in&s;trument in this work: (this &s;ir, is the doc|trine you and Dr. W. have plainly taught, and which I oppo&s;ed) but they teach to this purpo&s;e, as we have &s;een above, that in the quickening action, or regenerating work of the Spirit he u&s;es go&s;|pel truth as his means or in&s;trument, inlightening the mind &s;pi|ritually and &s;avingly to under&s;tand the things of God, impre&s;&s;ing a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of them on the heart, under, and by which action and influence the man is quickened and enabled to an&s;wer the call and embrace the grace offered. So we mu&s;t under&s;tand them, or they will be involved in contradiction.</P>
<P>In this view of their doctrine it is true. It is you &s;ir, who are departed from the We&s;tmin&s;ter doctrine in this particular.&mdash;You al&s;o &s;ay, Repentance preceeds faith, but they repre&s;ent it as the fruit of faith, as all &s;ound calvini&s;ts do. In their &s;horter catechi&s;m they &s;ay,
<Q>Repentance is a &s;aving grace, whereby a &s;inner out of a true &s;en&s;e of his &s;in, and apprehen&s;ion of the mercy of God in Chri&s;t, doth with grief and hatred of his &s;in, turn from it unto God.</Q></P>
<P>You ob&s;erve &s;ir, (p. 12.) that in my dialogue, I &s;ay, God gra|ciou&s;ly <HI>&s;ubdues</HI> the <HI>enmity, changes</HI> and <HI>reconciles</HI> the &s;oul, by <HI>letting in the light,</HI> and &s;weet, <HI>attractive &s;en&s;e</HI> of his <HI>holy truth and love</HI>; and that I add,
<Q>The <HI>new</HI> divines indeed are &s;o bold as to &s;ay, all this is not &s;ufficient to convert and <HI>reconcile</HI> one &s;oul.</Q>
On this you
<PB N="10" REF="011678_0010_0F87C8E3B5C215C0">
are plea&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q>Mr. H. cannot find, I tru&s;t, any divine, old or new, that ever did, or ever will &s;ay this. I think I may &s;afely pronounce this as <HI>fal&s;e</HI> a propo&s;ition as <HI>can</HI> be collected from any author whatever.</Q>
Plea&s;e &s;ir, to turn your eye on what I quoted from Dr. Whitaker ju&s;t now; and ob&s;erve the&s;e other pa&s;&s;ages in his &s;ermons,
<Q>The wonderful manife&s;tations of God's love and grace in the go&s;pel, with all the moving and melting accents of his mercy, are <HI>not &s;ufficient</HI> to <HI>prevail</HI> with one &s;inner to make up the quarrel with God. p. 44. The manife&s;tation of the divine glory by Chri&s;t, tran&s;cends every other method in which God hath revealed his perfection;&mdash; but all this <HI>&s;erves not</HI> to <HI>engage</HI> unrenewed man to love, but more &s;en&s;ibly to abhor God, in proportion to the clearer manife&s;tation of his nature and perfection.</Q>
p. 50. If &s;o God does not &s;ubdue the enmity, con|vert and reconcile the &s;oul, by letting in the light, and attractive &s;en&s;e of his holy truth and love. For the &s;en&s;e thereof acts in the heart as a <HI>repul&s;ive</HI> force.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Hopkins, in his &s;ermon on Joh. 1.13. &s;ays,
<Q>Light is not, <HI>cannot</HI> be given <HI>antecedent</HI> to regeneration <HI>in order to influence or change the heart or will.</HI>&mdash;The more the divine character, and the things of God's moral kingdom &mdash; are &s;een and under&s;tood &mdash; by &s;uch an one,</Q>
(by any man who is not fir&s;t regenerated and changed) 'the greater will be the mind's di&s;gu&s;t at them.' and the more it will hate them p. 41, 42. 'Light and truth is not in <HI>any degree</HI> the <HI>means by which</HI> this change is effected.' p. 39. He &s;ays much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t, &s;ir, you will admit the&s;e gentlemen as good witne&s;&s;es. If you do, my propo&s;ition, which you &s;ay is notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, is fully proved to be true, and my accu&s;er turns out poorly. I am &s;orry for him; but &s;ee no way how you can bring him off but by &s;aying, Mr. Hopkins and Dr. W. are no divines.&mdash;Many other charges of fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, as indefen&s;ible as that above, I pa&s;s over unno|ticed, particularly that poor one in the margin, p. 13. and that mean &s;ugge&s;tion in the margin, p. 16.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, &s;ir, you complain of injury and fal&s;hood in that I &s;ometimes call the new doctrines Sandemanean errors. When you objected this to me at my hou&s;e, I an&s;wered that the new &s;cheme and Sandeman's are near akin, coincident in &s;ome things, and both come to much the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue. More than this is not pretended in the dialogue, tho' in &s;ome particular pa&s;&s;ages I may have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf too loo&s;ely. If your &s;miting was that of the righteous, I would e&s;teem it as excellent oil. But unhappily for you, you are come abroad this time in the &s;pirit of a Jew at the clo&s;e of his fa&s;t. As the teachers of the <HI>new</HI> &s;cheme of doctrine had not given it a <HI>new</HI> name, I was a little in doubt what name it ought to be called by.
<PB N="11" REF="011678_0011_0F87C8E4564A0630">
Calvini&s;m I could not call it, without mi&s;leading my readers. It appeared to me much nearer related to Sandeman than to Calvin, &s;o I &s;ometimes loo&s;ely called it the Sandemanean &s;cheme. But &s;ince it di&s;plea&s;es, I forbear. Plea&s;e, &s;ir, to give the <HI>poor &s;tranger</HI> a proper name. It is your right to name your own children. If it is called after your own name, I believe nobody will be di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>You, &s;ir, labour to convince your readers that I have embraced &s;everal of Mr. Sandeman's di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrines and know it not, (p. 14.) This is plea&s;ant enough. Fir&s;t of all you repre&s;ented me as agreeing with the Devil, (p. 8.) now with Mr. Sandeman. If your wrath ri&s;e a little higher, I fear you will undertake next to prove that I have al&s;o embraced Mr. Hopkins's &s;entiments, and knew it not.&mdash;You have actually done &s;o, towards the clo&s;e of your letter.</P>
<P>Speaking of Mr. Edwards's piece on the nature of virtue, you ob&s;erve, that his notion of virtue and natural con&s;cience, &amp;c.
<Q>are <HI>fundamental</HI> to the &s;cheme of doctrines I oppo&s;e.</Q>
They are &s;o! And his notion of virtue is new and &s;trange, and the &s;cheme you have built upon it new&mdash;Both mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together. You a&s;k,
<Q>Why did not Mr. Hart take this di&s;&s;ertation in hand, and cen&s;ure and confute it? This would be&mdash;laying the ax to the root of the tree.</Q>
It would.&mdash;I will al&s;o tell you why I did not. I had not then &s;een that di&s;&s;ertation, tho' I had heard of it. If I had &s;een that, and your &s;ermons before I wrote, my dialogue would, in &s;ome re&s;pects, have been more perfect. I have &s;ince read that di&s;&s;ertation, and laid the ax to the root of the tree; and perhaps &s;hall publi&s;h &s;ome remarks upon it, &s;hewing that Mr. Edwards's notions of virtue, of the <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauty of moral things, &amp;c. are wrong, imaginary, and fatally de&s;tructive of the foundations of morality and true religion: If I do, I hope to have the piece out of the pre&s;s by next commencement. Since you think this will be doing &s;omething, and that I ought to have done it before, I pre&s;ume this intelligence will plea&s;e you, and that you will &s;ub&s;cribe for a dozen copies, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, (p. 17.)
<Q>One de&s;ign of pre&s;ident Edwards's piece on virtue, is to &s;hew that men have <HI>naturally no degree</HI> of <HI>true</HI> virtue, but are wholly corrupt. And he has there con&s;idered the very things Mr. H. &s;ays to <HI>prove the contrary</HI>&mdash;and &s;hews, that what Mr. H. calls <HI>virtue</HI> and an approbation of moral good, is nothing but natural con&s;cience and natural ta&s;te, both which are con&s;i&s;t|ent with the&mdash;mo&s;t perfect corruption of heart, and oppo&s;ition to all moral good.</Q>
Here, &s;ir, if I under&s;tand your meaning, you lead your reader to think I have &s;aid and endeavored to prove that men have <HI>naturally &s;ome degree of true virtue,</HI> and that their na|tural corruption is partial, as limited and re&s;tricted by &s;ome re|maining
<PB N="12" REF="011678_0012_0F87C8E4DC78E8F0">
degree of <HI>true</HI> virtue in the heart naturally; and that I repre&s;ent the approbation which natural con&s;cience or the natural moral ta&s;te gives to virtue or moral good, &s;imply con&s;idered as &s;uch, as a <HI>truly virtuous</HI> approbation, or an exerci&s;e of &s;ome degree of true virtue, natural to the heart of man. In all this you impo&s;e upon your reader, and abu&s;e his confidence in you. I &s;aid nothing of all this, and what is more, I have not tho't it. You have given here as wrong an idea of what I &s;aid, and of what I believe, as could well be given. If you tho't your&s;elf warranted to &s;ay this of me, by what I &s;aid in the &s;econd dialogue, you mu&s;t have read it with very little attention or great partiality.&mdash;I would not be under|&s;tood to intimate that I think Mr. Edwards's notions of the nature of true virtue are right. They are e&s;&s;entially wrong, and the view you give of my &s;entiments is e&s;&s;entially wrong. If you ever &s;ee my remarks on his piece, you will know more fully what my &s;en|timents are. In the mean time, I pray you not injuriou&s;ly to mi&s;|repre&s;ent me any more, as you have done thro'out your animad|ver&s;ions. Is it not too much like the conduct of the old heathen in dre&s;&s;ing up the chri&s;tians in bears &s;kins, and &s;etting their dogs upon them? If you write again in a controver&s;ial way, I wi&s;h you to honor your&s;elf as a fair and equitable writer and rea&s;oner. This is what we are commanded. And your &s;pirit and manner ought to be very good, to make &s;ome amends for the badne&s;s of your principles.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, &s;ir, what you &s;ay, (p. 18.) relating to my mentioning a pa&s;&s;age in Dr. Bellamy's &s;ermon, at the college chappel, &amp;c.&mdash; In an&s;wer to this, I will only remind you of what I told you; when at my hou&s;e you profe&s;&s;ed your &s;elf offended with me for mention|ing of it I thus told you,
<Q>I had my information concerning the doctrine there delivered from four or five gentlemen who heard that di&s;cour&s;e,</Q>
(this was at different times, each one giving me his information in the ab&s;ence of the others)
<Q>that after I had wrote what I at fir&s;t tho't proper on that head, I &s;hewed it to &s;undry of my informers, de&s;iring them to ob&s;erve whether my repre&s;entation was ju&s;t, (two of them were the Dr's particular friends) and reduced it to what I finally publi&s;hed, as what the mo&s;t &s;crupulous &s;aid he well remembered the Dr. did &s;ay, if not in tho&s;e very words, yet to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: I ob&s;erved further, that a di&s;cour&s;e, once delivered in &s;o public a manner, becomes public property.</Q>
All this &s;eemed to calm your re&s;entment: But an evil &s;pirit &s;eems now to trouble you.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, Sir, you endeavor (p. 19 to 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.) to per&s;uade your readers I am incon&s;i&s;tent with my&s;elf in &s;undry important particu|lars, and really own the doctrines I condemn: I don't think it needful to an&s;wer you particularly as to this. The incon&s;i&s;tencies
<PB N="13" REF="011678_0013_0F87C8E5A0EAAA90">
you complain of are of your own making. The appearance of contradictions is the re&s;ult of your mi&s;con&s;tructions, mi&s;repre&s;en|tations, and fal&s;e colourings. Pray, &s;ir, turn a &s;erious thought on what you have wrote in the la&s;t paragraph of your 24th p. and fir&s;t part of the 25th. You know, &s;ir, that in dialogue writing, one of the &s;peakers <HI>only</HI> per&s;onates the author, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak his &s;entiments, the others not, only &s;o far as he approves or admits them; and that in my dialogue the clergyman per&s;onates the writer. In the pa&s;&s;age you refer to, (in p. 67 of the dialogue) I made the gentleman &s;ay,
<Q>all rea&s;onable and hone&s;t men, I think, can be at no lo&s;s to determine on which &s;ide the truth lies.</Q>
&mdash; This I did (as &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome per&s;ons, more zealous than charitable, would be ready to make &s;uch a ra&s;h conclu&s;ion) that I might cen|&s;ure it as unju&s;t, and inculcate a more charitable and generous &s;entiment; which I make the clergyman do immediately, in his reply. All this mu&s;t be obvious to every intelligent and impartial reader. Yet you are plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent this &s;entiment of the Gentleman, fir&s;t, in a fal&s;e and very aggravated light, and then to impute it to me, and repre&s;ent me as thinking all the mo&s;t noted Calvini&s;t divines are unrea&s;onable and <HI>di&s;hone&s;t</HI> men; and cry out, 'This a bold &s;troke indeed.' This of yours is indeed a bold &s;troke. &mdash;You next repre&s;ent me as a little &s;hocked at this &s;evere cen&s;ure, and attempting to correct and &s;often it; but to very little purpo&s;e, according to your repre&s;entation. If I was your enemy (which I am not) I could not wi&s;h you to di&s;honor your&s;elf more, than, I think you have done in this &s;urpri&s;ing paragraph, and indeed thro' this whole piece. In this paragraph your rea&s;oning &s;uppo&s;es that
<Q>the We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;embly, and many of the mo&s;t noted divines in New-England, and el&s;ewhere,</Q>
agree with you and Dr. W. and that I in cen&s;uring your peculiar &s;entiments equally cen&s;ured theirs. This is a favorite repre&s;entation. I believe this will be tho't unju&s;t by the judicious: and it ought to be &s;o tho't by you, if you would be con&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elf; for you &s;ay, (p. 28)
<Q>I have &s;ome|time tho't the doctrines which have of late been called by many <HI>new divinity,</HI> are really a revival and <HI>improvement</HI> of &s;ound Calvin|i&s;m.</Q>
'Tis only &s;o far as they are what you call an <HI>improvement</HI> that others call them <HI>new,</HI> and that I cen&s;ured them as <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> And thus far they are not patroni&s;ed by the re&s;pectable body of Calvi|ni&s;t divines 'from the reformation down to this day.' How could they? The improvements you &s;peak of are <HI>new.</HI> Mr. Edwards's po&s;thumous piece, on virtue, you acknowlege is
<Q>the <HI>root</HI> of the tree;</Q>
which you have cultivated and adorned with many of its branches.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, &s;ir,
<Q>It is reported that a number of mini&s;ters in New-England, who were zealous promoters of the revival of religion
<PB N="14" REF="011678_0014_0F87C8E68E06DDB8">
(about 30 years ago) and did then abundantly preach up the doctrine of total depravity, do now profe&s;s their approbation of Mr. H's piece. If any &s;uch there are, <HI>it becomes them to know</HI> that they have indeed changed &s;ides, and departed from the faith they once earne&s;tly contended for.</Q>
And you, &s;ir, have rebuked them &s;harply that they may be &s;ound in the faith. But I be&s;peak your pity and tenderne&s;s for them. Poor gentlemen, they have embraced Arminian errors, and are become oppo&s;ers of revived re|ligion, 'and know it not!' and I believe never would have known it, if you had not revealed it to them. If they go no farther than to pity you, you ought to be thankful to them for their lenity.</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, my objections again&s;t the new &s;cheme, are in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame that Arminians have always made again&s;t Calvini&s;m. I believe, Sir, you are under &s;ome mi&s;take in this.&mdash; But &s;uppo&s;e it &s;o, they may lie again&s;t your doctrines, and be unan&s;werable on your principles, tho' not &s;o on Calvini&s;tic princi|ples. Suppo&s;e a foreign body plays cannon again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's fort; may not the King's &s;oldiers after this point the &s;ame cannon again&s;t a fort erected by the Pretender, and be blamele&s;s? Would you call them the King's enemies becau&s;e they do &s;o?</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over many other things in your animadver&s;ions, which de&s;erve to be animadverted upon. Indeed you have &s;aid very little but what merits cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>I have heard Dr. Whitaker is writing again&s;t the dialogue, you intimate as much; and &s;uppo&s;e your animadver&s;ions are &s;ent out as his <HI>forerunner.</HI> They are well adapted to prejudice people in favor of what he may have to offer. But I que&s;tion whether the method you have taken is calculated to give them <HI>ears to hear</HI> with that impartiality which becomes chri&s;tian men. Your forerunner, as we have &s;een, has made &s;trait ways crooked, and &s;mooth ways ruff. I hope the Dr. will have more wi&s;dom than to walk in your prepared road.</P>
<P>I have two reque&s;ts to make to you &s;ir, if you will be &s;o good as to hear them; fir&s;t, that you will once more review your ani|madver&s;ions, with &s;olemn &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and blame your&s;elf before God for whatever you have rea&s;on to think is di&s;plea&s;ing to him in them, or in the &s;pirit with which they are wrote. Indeed &s;ir, you do not write with a good &s;pirit. In your reply to Mr. Mills you treated that worthy father <HI>very ill,</HI> in an ungenerous and unwor|thy manner. This is the judgment of all I have heard &s;peak of it, who have read it. And now, be&s;ides mi&s;repre&s;enting many things to your readers, you have manife&s;tly endeavoured to injure me, and render me the object of unju&s;t popular odium and con|tempt; and to this purpo&s;e have &s;aid many things, which, for your &s;ake, I was &s;orry to &s;ee. So far as I am injured by you, I am
<PB N="15" REF="011678_0015_0F87C8EAD327DEA0">
ready to forgive you, whenever you are in a prepared di&s;po&s;ition to a&s;k and receive God's forgivene&s;s; which, I wi&s;h we may both obtain for all our wrongne&s;&s;es, and grace thoroughly to &s;weeten and chri&s;tianize our &s;pirits.</P>
<P>My &s;econd reque&s;t to you &s;ir, is, that you will calmly and im|partially review the <HI>new</HI> doctrines you have advanced, and no more perplex and corrupt the doctrines of truth, by mingling them with metaphy&s;ical notions, <HI>fal&s;ly</HI> &s;o called. The ob&s;ervation of pre&s;ident Edwards, which you mention'd to me in conver&s;ation, is ju&s;t, viz.
<Q>That no man is under greater temptation than an author who has unhappily advanced indefen&s;ible doctrines.</Q>
This is eminently &s;o, when he has expected to get him&s;elf a name thereby. It may be <HI>hard</HI> to overcome this temptation, but it mu&s;t be done. We ought &s;ir, to be &s;o much above our &s;elves as to be able to re-examine our own public doctrines with as great impartiality as tho&s;e of any other man, and to retract and cen&s;ure them, once &s;een to be erroneous, as freely as the errors of any other. What are we? what is our honour, as contra&s;ted with the truth it&s;elf, and with the honor of the great teacher of truth? How much lighter than the &s;malle&s;t du&s;t of the ballance? I am &s;trongly convinced &s;ir, I believe, on the foot of the clear<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> and fulle&s;t evidence, that your &s;cheme of doctrine relating to the natu|ral enmity, regeneration, and their con&s;equences, is fal&s;e, and de|&s;tructive of the go&s;pel of God; and am per&s;waded you are ma&s;ter of &s;o much di&s;cerning and judgment, that if you can re-examine it with &s;trict impartiality, free from prejudice, you will &s;ee it to be &s;o, and repudiate it. I am not about to rea&s;on with you upon this &s;ubject; but &s;uffer me to &s;ugge&s;t one thing: Your &s;cheme is, in many re&s;pects, incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and with &s;undry go&s;pel truths which you hold: and you know <HI>truth</HI> is <HI>&s;elf-con&s;i&s;tent throughout.</HI> I will only mention one of your incon&s;i&s;ten|cies. You &s;ir, and all the brotherhood, &s;o far as I have &s;een, &s;ay the natural corruption, enmity, and impotence of the heart, is <HI>wholly</HI> of the <HI>moral</HI> kind, and that the change which is wrought in what you call regeneration, is a <HI>moral,</HI> not a phy&s;ical change; and yet you &s;ay, this change is not, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be effected by a <HI>moral</HI> influence and power of the Spirit of God, <HI>with the go&s;pel truth</HI>; that it is, and can be effected only by a phy&s;ical or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">|culous operation of the Spirit, without giving light, or applying go&s;pel truth. You mu&s;t, Sir, make both phy&s;ical, or both <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, or remain intangled in incon&s;i&s;tency: But the <HI>truth</HI> is not thus bound.
