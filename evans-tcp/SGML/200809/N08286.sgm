<BIBL>ACTS XVII. 2, 3.</BIBL>
<Q>"And Paul, as his manner was,&mdash;rea&s;oned with them out of the &s;criptures; opening and alledg|ing that Chri&s;t mu&s;t needs have &s;uffered, and ri&s;en again from the dead; and that this Je&s;us, whom I preach unto you, is the Chri&s;t."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul (an account of who&s;e preaching is tran&s;mitted to us in the&s;e words) was, in point of natural abilities, and humanely acquir|ed accompli&s;hments, the greate&s;t by far of all the apo&s;tles. More than this, he was exceeded by none of them in gracious qua|lities as a chri&s;tian; or extraordinary gifts as an officer in the kingdom of God, which was now &s;etting up in the world. Perhaps, we have in him, after due prefe|rence
<PB N="6" REF="010580_0004_0F80D0DF60FCA420">
to our great Ma&s;ter and Lord, the mo&s;t compleat pattern of the good man, e&s;pecially the good mini&s;ter. Who, among tho&s;e, whether in&s;pired or unin&s;pired, that have been thought worthy to be entru&s;ted with the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, were ever better qualified for their work, &s;pirited to it, or that laboured in it with more prudence, diligence, fidelity, and per&s;eve|ring re&s;olution, amid&s;t the greate&s;t trials and difficulties? Were directions to be gi|ven to form the mo&s;t re&s;pectable mini&s;te|rial character, they could not be fetched from a more &s;triking and in&s;tructive ex|ample (our Saviour's only excepted) than this of the apo&s;tle Paul's, as &s;et forth in the &s;acred books.</P>
<P>TWO things eminently exemplary in him, and worthy of the particular notice of all go&s;pel-mini&s;ters, are recorded in my text, and may employ our pre&s;ent medi|tations; the MANNER in which he prea|ched, and the SUBJECTS he preached up|on.</P>
<P>AS to his manner of preaching, it was RATIONAL, and SCRIPTURAL. Says the
<PB N="7" REF="010580_0005_0F80D0E09D023560">
text, "he rea&s;oned with them out of the &s;criptures."</P>
<P>HIS preaching was RATIONAL; that is to &s;ay, he made u&s;e of good arguing in his di&s;cour&s;es. He did not &s;peak to his hearers in a confu&s;ed, incoherent, way; but there was a clear and ju&s;t connection in what he &s;aid. One thing depended on another, was illu&s;trated by it, or deduci|ble from it. He applied to the under&s;tan|dings of men for their enlightning, to their judgments for their information, to their con&s;ciences for their conviction; and not merely to their affections and pa&s;&s;ions to warm and melt them.</P>
<P>THIS was the way in which he preach|ed to the The&s;&s;alonian Jews. And it was his MANNER in preaching at other times, and in the audience of other people. To be &s;ure, if we may judge of his preaching, either by his epi&s;tles, which make &s;o con|&s;iderable a part of the new-te&s;tament; or by his apologies for him&s;elf; or by the go&s;pel he preached, the record of which we have in the book of <HI>Acts,</HI> it was not in the way of a loo&s;e, unconnected application to the affections of men; nor in the way
<PB N="8" REF="010580_0006_0F80D0E10B1D1BA8">
of mere authoritative, magi&s;terial affirma|tion, in virtue of his apo&s;tle&s;hip, and ex|traordinary character as a me&s;&s;enger from God; but by rea&s;oning upon what he &s;aid, by making good what he delivered by pro|per inference and deduction. This was his MANNER of preaching. And by it, as one ob&s;erves, "he has &s;anctified rea&s;on to the purpo&s;es of religion, and &s;hewed us that one &s;ort, and indeed the be&s;t &s;ort, of good preaching con&s;i&s;ts in good arguing".</P>
<P>SOME there are, I am &s;en&s;ible, who are rather offended than plea&s;ed, when preachers &s;peak to them upon things per|taining to the kingdom of God and Chri&s;t in a way of rea&s;oning; though they here|in copy after the example of an in&s;pired apo&s;tle. They have no reli&s;h for di&s;cour|&s;es, unle&s;s adapted to excite their pa&s;&s;ions. If the&s;e are put in motion, they ap|plaud the preacher, and imagine they have gained &s;piritual profit: Whereas, if he &s;o opens his &s;ubject, by good rea&s;oning, as to &s;et it before their under&s;tandings in a clear and &s;trong point of view, it is in their ac|count, a poor in&s;ipid bu&s;ine&s;s, not at all calculated to the purpo&s;e of godly edifying.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010580_0007_0F80D0E1A80DD478">
BUT they are herein egregiou&s;ly mi&s;ta|ken. It &s;hould always be remembred, the pa&s;&s;ions may be moved, when the di&s;|cour&s;e, far from being in&s;tructive, is crude, rambling, unconnected, and, it may be, incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. The excitement of &s;en&s;ations that are plea&s;ing may be the effect, not of light operating in the mind, but of mere &s;ounds modulated in a certain way. And whenever this is the ca&s;e, as it too often is in fact, the motion in the af|fections is nothing more than the mere working of animal nature. 'Tis wholly a mechanical production, and of no &s;er|vice in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e: Whereas, when truth, by ju&s;t rea&s;oning, is let into the mind &s;o as to be clearly perceived and well under&s;tood, real good is done; yea, good that may, if it be not our own fault, turn out to &s;aving advantage. The apo&s;tle Paul therefore, who was well acquainted with human nature, rea&s;oned with his hearers, as the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t effectual method he could take to promote their religious improvement. He knew that warmth in the pa&s;&s;ions was, at be&s;t, mo|mentary and vani&s;hing, and would cer|tainly fail of an&s;wering any good end, un|le&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="010580_0008_0F80D0E25EE59B60">
light and truth were fir&s;t conveyed in|to the mind. He knew he was &s;peaking to men, who, as they are endowed with in|tellectual powers, ought chiefly to be influ|enced by their under&s;tandings, not their affections, and mu&s;t be &s;o influenced, if they are ever influenced to good purpo&s;e in the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;alvation. It was accor|dingly his main care to rea&s;on with them, offering what was proper to open and en|large their minds, and "fill them with the knowledge of God's will in all &s;piritual wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding."</P>
<P>NOT that the pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be neg|lected. They have their u&s;e in religion, as well as in common life; and may with pertinency, and to good purpo&s;e, be &s;tir|red up. But then care &s;hould be taken as to the way in which this is done. Surely, it ought not to be attempted by a &s;eeming|ly &s;olemn u&s;e of mere words and phra&s;es, which though pious in their &s;ound, yet have no plain, if intelligible, meaning; nor by a noi&s;y fervor in &s;peaking that is only hi&s;trionical and affected; nor by that management of voice and ge&s;ture which is nothing more than the effect of worldly policy. This was not the way in which
<PB N="11" REF="010580_0009_0F80D0E64B5E3B88">
the apo&s;tle Paul endeavoured to affect his hearers. He de&s;pi&s;ed the thought of pro|curing admiration, or any profitable at|tendant on it, by crafty addre&s;&s;es, artfully contrived to plea&s;e his hearers by tickling their fancies, and rai&s;ing a u&s;ele&s;s motion in their pa&s;&s;ions. Says he to the chri&s;tians at Corinth, 1 Cor. ii. 4. "My &s;peech and my preaching was not with enti|cing words of mans wi&s;dom." What does the apo&s;tle here mean by "enticing words of mans wi&s;dom"? If he had any meaning at all, his view was directly pointed at that artful manner of placing and pronouncing words, by which de&s;igning men, in that day, &s;o moved the affections of the people, as, under this influence, to per&s;uade them to will and do ju&s;t as they would have them. And why did he not endeavour, in this way, to allure tho&s;e he conver&s;ed with, and preached to? Surely, not becau&s;e he wanted ability in this kind! His invention was ready, his imagination lively, he had words at com|mand. Be&s;ides, having been educated under the care of the great Gamaliel, he was learned in "the wi&s;dom of words," that is, in all the invented arts to work mechanically upon men's pa&s;&s;ions to lead them blindfold. But he e&s;teemed it a di&s;|grace
<PB N="12" REF="010580_0010_0F80D0E7020A79E8">
to the go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God, a deba&s;ement of its infinitely intere&s;ting truths, to deliver them in this worldly-wi&s;e manner; as though they needed the help of man's wi&s;dom to give them force to touch the heart, and &s;et the affections into all the motion that would &s;erve to any religious purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>NOT that he rea&s;oned with his hearers in a dull, cold, lifele&s;s manner, having up|on his mind no ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the important weight of eternal concerns. His heart was thoroughly warmed when he preach|ed; and he uttered him&s;elf, without all doubt, as one that was in real earne&s;t, and &s;o as that it might be &s;een that he was &s;o. The God of nature has &s;o formed us, that we cannot &s;peak upon matters which lie with weight upon our minds, and greatly affect us, without the di&s;covery of it in the very manner of our &s;peaking. There are certain outward &s;igns by which the in|ward feeling of the heart is indicated; and they are &s;o obvious, and naturally &s;triking, that they cannot ea&s;ily be mi&s;|under&s;tood: And they have the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to arre&s;t the attention, and tran&s;mit the like &s;en&s;ations to tho&s;e who are &s;poken to. In this naturally and
<PB N="13" REF="010580_0011_0F80D0E7A4C6A470">
powerfully affecting way the apo&s;tle Paul delivered his rea&s;onings with the people, upon the great affairs of their &s;ouls and everla&s;ting &s;alvation; and it is the be&s;t, perhaps the only proper way in which they &s;hould be delivered. Theatrical airs are well enough &s;uited to performances on the &s;tage, where the putting mens pa&s;&s;ions and affections into a plea&s;ing commotion for the pre&s;ent is all that is aimed at. But the pulpit does not &s;eem a fit place for acting a part. By mimicking nature, if it is done well, or, what means, in this ca&s;e, preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, by artfully play|ing the hypocrite, preachers may move the pa&s;&s;ions of their hearers: but the emo|tion, in this way excited, is mo&s;t com|monly of the &s;ame kind with that which is occa&s;ioned by "the &s;ounding of bra&s;s, and the tinkling of a cymbol;" and of as little u&s;e or profit in the affairs of reli|gion and &s;alvation.&mdash;But I mu&s;t not en|large.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul's preaching was SCRIPTURAL, as well as rational. The meaning is, he made u&s;e of &s;cripture-arguments in his di&s;cour&s;es; in this way illu&s;trating and confirming the truths he
<PB N="14" REF="010580_0012_0F80D0E867E43C08">
delivered, wherein he could do it with propriety. Says the text, "he rea&s;oned with them out of the &s;criptures." He did not merely cite a pa&s;&s;age or two from thence, but argued upon the texts he had occa&s;ion to mention; entering into their true &s;pirit, opening their &s;en&s;e, and point|ing out their pertinency as proofs of this or the other truth he was upon. And it was his manner to be thus &s;criptural, when he had to do with the Jews, as was the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES his hearers, and the &s;ub|jects mo&s;t proper to &s;peak to them upon, were &s;uch, that arguments from rea&s;on were the fitte&s;t to be u&s;ed with them. And, in this ca&s;e, his arguing was from mere rational principles. Thus, when he was called to preach before Felix, the Ro|man governor, con&s;idering his character as an unju&s;t and adulterous man, he "rea&s;oned with him of righteou&s;ne&s;s and temperance," as well as "a judg|ment to come."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxii. 5.</NOTE> So when he preach|ed to the idolatrous people at Ly&s;tra, his &s;ubject was, "their turning from vanities," or idols, "to the living God." And the method of rea&s;oning he u&s;ed was, a
<PB N="15" REF="010580_0013_0F80D0E985BA56D0">
repre&s;entation of God to them not only as "the maker of heaven and earth," but the God who had given to all nations &s;ufficient evidence of his being and provi|dential government, for that "he had done them good, and given them rain from heaven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling their hearts with food and gladne&s;s."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xviv. 15. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT whenever he preached to the Jews, who were well acquainted with the wri|tings of the old-te&s;tament, and received them as given by in&s;piration of God, "he rea&s;oned with them out of the&s;e &s;criptures." And it was his cu&s;tom to do &s;o. A nota|ble &s;pecimen of this we have in my text, to which I may add that &s;imilar one, in Acts xiii. from the 16th to the 37th ver&s;e; where, from the heads, at lea&s;t, of a long &s;ermon which he preached, it appears to have been a chain of &s;cripture-rea&s;oning calculated and intended to prove the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, and upon this ba&s;is to publi&s;h that mo&s;t intere&s;ting go&s;pel-doctrine, in the 38th and 39th ver&s;es, "Be it known un|to you therefore, men and brethren, that,
<PB N="16" REF="010580_0014_0F80D0E9EBB93CC0">
through this man, is preached unto you the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins; and by him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all things, from which ye could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es."</P>
<P>AND rea&s;oning from the &s;cripture is the be&s;t way of preaching. The apo&s;tle Paul &s;hould herein be imitated by the pre|&s;ent mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. Not that we may not, as prudence may direct, preach upon &s;ubjects that will require other rea|&s;oning. There are truths it may be pro|per, at certain times, and upon &s;ome oc|ca&s;ions, to bring into the pulpit, the know|ledge of which is derived primarily, at lea&s;t, from rea&s;on, not from revelation. And it cannot be expected that preachers, in regard of the&s;e truths, &s;hould enlarge on &s;cripture-arguments, any more than Paul did, when he was proving to the Athenians a principle of natural religion: Though, even in the&s;e points, all the light &s;hould be fetched from the &s;cripture that their nature will admit of. But the main &s;ubjects to be in&s;i&s;ted on by go&s;pel-mini|&s;ters are &s;cripture-ones, "the my&s;teries that were hid from ages and generations,
<PB N="17" REF="010580_0015_0F80D0EAA1BA5E70">
but have been made manife&s;t" by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. And &s;cripture-rea&s;oning is the fitte&s;t to be u&s;ed upon the&s;e &s;ubjects: Nor indeed, without this, will any other do.</P>
<P>IT may be worth ob&s;erving here, the di&s;|tingui&s;hing truths of chri&s;tianity, which the apo&s;tle Paul preached, he received, not in a way meerly human, but by immediate reve|lation from God. It is by revelation al&s;o that go&s;pel-mini&s;ters ever &s;ince have derived their knowledge of the&s;e truths; but in a different way. It is not directly communi|cated to them from the fountain of light, but mediately by the &s;criptures, which were "wrote by holy men as moved by the holy Gho&s;t." This difference between the apo&s;tle Paul, and go&s;pel-mini&s;ters in the&s;e days, obviou&s;ly points out a difference in that method of rea&s;oning which was u&s;ed by him, and that which ought to be u&s;ed by them. He freely and openly &s;pake of the doctrines he delivered as what he had immediately re|ceived of the Lord; which it would be high arrogance in them to pre&s;ume to do. Not that he expected, or de&s;ired, that his hearers &s;hould give credit to his meer affirmation. He rea&s;oned with them to convince them, upon the foot of ju&s;t and &s;olid evidence, that
<PB N="18" REF="010580_0016_0F80D0EDC3CB0220">
he was authori&s;ed by God to be his me&s;&s;enger to make known the coun&s;els of his will rela|tive to man's &s;alvation. And he rea&s;oned with them al&s;o to &s;hew them the con&s;i&s;tency of the truths he declared with the revelations of Mo&s;es and the prophets; and not only &s;o, but with the dictates of right rea&s;on, as being worthy of God, honorary to his perfections and government, and fit to be believed by all who profe&s;s to have under&s;tanding. This &s;ame way of rea&s;oning is proper for go&s;pel-mini&s;ters at pre&s;ent, and will be &s;o in all fu|ture time. But be&s;ides this, the &s;criptures being to them the only true &s;ource of know|ledge in the chri&s;tian &s;cheme of doctrine and practice, the&s;e eminently are the &s;ource al&s;o from whence they &s;hould fetch their rea&s;on|ings upon this head. They may, in this way, convey to their hearers "the truth as it is in Je&s;us;" and it &s;hould be their main &s;tudy to do &s;o. Having, by a due u&s;e of their rea|&s;oning powers, always depending upon the divine guidance and help, collected from the &s;criptures a clear, di&s;tinct, and full idea of re|vealed truths, they &s;hould, in the &s;ame way communicate it in their preaching. They cannot be too &s;trong and cogent in thus rea|&s;oning from the &s;criptures, if, at the &s;ame time, they rea&s;on with per&s;picuity, and &s;o as
<PB N="19" REF="010580_0017_0F80D0EF0DF46EF8">
to be readily under&s;tood. It is, indeed, the be&s;t, the only proper way, in which they &s;hould apply to people to let them into "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God," as it has been manife&s;ted in the go&s;pel-reve|lation.</P>
<P>SOME there are, I know, who have an ill opinion of the u&s;e of rea&s;on in matters of re|ligion. What, &s;ay they, has rea&s;on to do with revelation? It is unfit to be employed by go&s;pel-preachers, and not worthy of the notice of go&s;pel-hearers.</P>
<P>IT is readily acknowledged, it would be a great impropriety in chri&s;tian mini&s;ters, and ju&s;tly offen&s;ive, if they &s;hould &s;ub&s;titute rea|&s;on in the room of revelation, either by treat|ing chiefly upon meer rational &s;ubjects, or by making rea&s;on, not the &s;cripture, the &s;ource of their arguings upon revealed truths. But it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, be &s;aid, they cannot take a more effectual method to honor reve|lation, and render it profitable to their hearers, than by the help of rea&s;oning to lead them into a clear, ju&s;t, and thorough conception of its true meaning. 'Tis a gro&s;s mi&s;take to imagine, that revelation ever was intended to &s;uper&s;ede the u&s;e of rea&s;oning in go&s;pel-preachers
<PB N="20" REF="010580_0018_0F80D0EF2A841050">
with reference to it. How could they &s;atisfy their hearers, that what they re|ceive as a divine revelation is not an impo&s;i|tion on their under&s;tandings, but by the u&s;e of rea&s;oning? Or if they have been before per&s;uaded, and upon good grounds, that the revelation they receive, really came from God, how &s;hall they let them into an appre|hen&s;ion of its meaning, but by &s;till rea&s;oning with them? In what other way can they make it evident to them, that this, and not that, is its true &s;en&s;e? Nay, if rea&s;oning is to be thrown by as u&s;ele&s;s, will not every &s;en&s;e that can be put on the &s;cripture be equally proper? Yea, may not the mo&s;t contrary &s;en&s;es be admitted at the &s;ame time, &s;ince rea&s;on only can point out the incon&s;i&s;tency between them? There is, in &s;hort, no way but this of rea&s;oning to open the &s;cripture, trace out the connection of its &s;everal parts, and a&s;certain preci&s;ely the &s;en&s;e in which this and the other part ought to be under&s;tood. Nor can mini&s;ters properly guard their people again&s;t any extravagancies, either in prin|ciple or practice, but by a due application to their under&s;tandings. This only will give check to wantone&s;s in their imaginations; and unle&s;s they will hearken to what may be offered in a way of ju&s;t rea&s;oning, can they be
<PB N="21" REF="010580_0019_0F80D0EFDF8F44F8">
hindered from following every idle fancy, till they have lo&s;t them&s;elves in the wilds of fal&s;ehood and incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>MINISTERS, 'tis true, may, by their rea|&s;oning, pervert the &s;cripture; giving it a wrong &s;en&s;e, or &s;o mixing corruption with the right one, as that the truth can &s;carce be di&s;cerned. But it will by no means follow from hence, that they mu&s;t lay a&s;ide rea&s;on|ing as of no &s;ervice in things pertaining to God and religion. The proper improvement of their being thus liable to mi&s;u&s;e the noble power of rea&s;oning is for people, on the one hand, not to e&s;teem them "lords of their faith," and implicitly give credit to all that they &s;ay; but, looking upon them as frail, imperfect, and falible men, to receive noth|ing they deliver for truth, only as they are convinced it is &s;o upon an impartial clo&s;e compari&s;on of it with the word of God: And for mini&s;ters, on the other hand, to keep as much as may be from all undue influence in the exertion of their rea&s;onable powers. In order whereto, they cannot, in too &s;erious and humble a frame of mind, put them&s;elves under the guidance of the Spirit of truth in their enquiries into the mind of Chri&s;t as revealed in the &s;cripture: Nor can they be too much

upon their guard, either again&s;t that "fear of man," on the one hand, "which brings a &s;nare," or that fondne&s;s for prai&s;e, and its plea&s;ing appendages, on the other, which is equally dangerous.

<P>BUT 'tis time that I pa&s;s, from the manner, to the SUBJECT-MATTER of the apo&s;tle Paul's preaching. And this was, that "Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t"; that "he mu&s;t needs have &s;uffered, and have ri&s;en again from the dead."</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t truth, I would mention as in&s;i&s;t|ed on by Paul in his preaching, was, that "Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t"; that is, the Me&s;&s;iah pointed out in the writings of the old te&s;ta|ment,
<PB N="23" REF="010580_0021_0F80D0F19E05D638">
and prophe&s;ied of as the &s;on of God, and Savior of men. This was a truth ne|ce&s;&s;ary his hearers &s;hould know, an e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite in order to their being chri&s;tians. He accordingly not only alledged, but clear|ly and fully proved to them, that that per&s;on, who had been &s;poken of among them by the name of Je&s;us, was "the Chri&s;t of God."</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be remembred here, the apo&s;tle Paul was now preaching to Jews, among whom there might be &s;ome pro&s;elyted Greeks, that is, Gentiles who had embraced the Jewi&s;h religion &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as to own the authority of the &s;criptures of the old-te&s;tement, Mo&s;es and the prophets. It was therefore "out of the&s;e &s;criptures," that he "rea&s;oned with them" in proof that that "Je&s;us whom he preached was the Chri&s;t." Doubtle&s;s, in pro&s;ecution of his argument, he pointed their view to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;acred books, in which the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah was particularly de&s;cribed, and on purpo&s;e that he might be known and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from all others, when he &s;hould come; making application of them to Je&s;us, and &s;howing their exact and punctual accom|pli&s;hment in him. And, as among the de|&s;criptive marks given in the old-te&s;tament of
<PB N="24" REF="010580_0022_0F80D0F221637858">
the Me&s;&s;iah, one was, that, in his day, and upon &s;etting up his kingdom, "the eyes of the blind &s;hould be opened and the ears of the deaf un&s;topped; the lame man &s;hould leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb &s;ing"; I &s;ay, as the&s;e miraculous works were to be wrought in the Me&s;&s;iah's day, we may be &s;ure the apo&s;tle Paul enlarged in his rea|&s;oning upon the wonders which had been done by Je&s;us him&s;elf, and by his apo&s;tles in his name, and by power communicated to them from him, in proof of his being the Chri&s;t, "he that was to come," as the re|deemer of I&s;rael. And having made it indi&s;putably evident, that, in fulfilment of the ancient prophe&s;ies, "the blind had received their &s;ight, the deaf their hearing, the lame their feet, and the dumb their tongues"; and this, by a touch only of the hand, or the &s;peaking of a word; not in a &s;ingle in&s;tance or two, but in multitudes; not in the ca&s;e of friends only, who might be &s;u&s;pected of de&s;ign, but of &s;trangers, ene|mies, any who happened to fall in the way of Je&s;us, or his apo&s;tles: I &s;ay, having clearly pointed out the fulfilment of the &s;cripture-prophe&s;ies, in the&s;e miracles which had been wrought in the times of the go&s;pel, by Je&s;us, or his apo&s;tles, his rea&s;oning was little &s;hort
<PB N="25" REF="010580_0023_0F80D0F30E592820">
of demon&s;tration; and if his hearers were not convinced, it could not be for want of evidence, but the perver&s;ene&s;s of their minds.</P>
<P>IT would not be mi&s;pent labor in the pre|&s;ent mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, if they &s;ometimes rea&s;oned with their hearers in proof that "Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t." The &s;tate of things 'tis true, is quite different now from what it was in the apo&s;tle Paul's days. Tho&s;e, he preached to, were, for the generality, &s;trangers to the religion of Je&s;us, having &s;carce ever heard of his name. One of the fir&s;t things therefore he had to do was, to convince his hearers, upon the foot of rea&s;on|able evidence, that "Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t." This was "the corner-&s;tone" he had to lay. And till this was laid, in vain mu&s;t he have endeavored to rai&s;e the go&s;pel-&s;uper&s;tructure. Tho&s;e we commonly preach to are chri&s;tians in name. They profe&s;s faith in Je&s;us as the Chri&s;t, and receive his religion as what came from God. It is not therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that, "leaving the principles of the doctrines of Chri&s;t," we &s;hould mainly endeavor to "lay again the foundation of faith" in a proof of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of that Je&s;us who&s;e religion we preach: Tho' if the evi|dence for this truth was oftner &s;et in a clear
<PB N="26" REF="010580_0024_0F80D0F640D201B8">
and full point of light before our hearers it would not be a needle&s;s labor. It could do no hurt to "the &s;trong in faith;" and it might be beneficial to tho&s;e of another cha|racter. It would happily tend to confirm the weak, and e&s;tabli&s;h the wavering. Where the faith of any was nothing more than the effect of education and cu&s;tom, it might fix it upon its proper ba&s;is, and render it not ea&s;ily liable to be &s;ubverted. And, above all, it might convince unbelievers, if it may be &s;uppo&s;ed any &s;uch there are among us; at lea&s;t, it would make it appear, that the faith of chri&s;tians was not owing to their credulity; but that they had good "rea&s;on for their hope," as founded on the go&s;pel-revelation.</P>
<P>ANOTHER truth the apo&s;tle Paul enlarged on was, "that Chri&s;t mu&s;t needs have &s;uf|fered." The great thing that hindered the Jews, who were now his auditors, from be|lieving in Je&s;us as the Chri&s;t, was, his having &s;uffered death. "Chri&s;t crucified is accord|ingly often &s;poken of, in the new-te&s;tament-books, as "a &s;tumbling-block to the Jews." They expected the Me&s;&s;iah would appear a mighty temporal deliverer; conquering their enemies, and making them the greate&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing kingdom in all the world.
<PB N="27" REF="010580_0025_0F80D0F76BB9DCE8">
But, as "Je&s;us of Nazareth," in&s;tead of a&s;|&s;uming the pomp and grandeur of an earthly king, &s;ubmitted to a &s;uffering life, and an ignominious death, they were "offended." This was "the &s;tone of &s;tumbling, and rock of offence," or, in more plain words, the great ob&s;tacle in the way of their faith. The apo&s;tle Paul, in order to remove away this ground of offence, "rea&s;oned with them out of the &s;criptures" upon the nece&s;&s;ity of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; "opening and alledging, that he mu&s;t needs have &s;uffered," that is, according to the prophe&s;ies of the old-te&s;ta|ment, which could not otherwi&s;e have re|ceived their accompli&s;hment. He may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have rea&s;oned with them after &s;ome &s;uch manner as this. It may be &s;tum|bling to you to hear Chri&s;t preached as one that has been crucified and slain; but it "behoved Chri&s;t to &s;uffer," it was really a matter of nece&s;&s;ity that he &s;hould die. Your own &s;criptures &s;peak of his &s;ufferings and death. Tho&s;e very writings which you own had their original from God, declare, that "the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould be cut off." He mu&s;t needs therefore have died. He could not have been the Me&s;&s;iah, if he had not. This very thing, in the character of Chri&s;t, his &s;uffering death, at which you are offended,
<PB N="28" REF="010580_0026_0F80D0F8878C2CB8">
is what mu&s;t have been. The writings of Mo&s;es and the prophets rendered it nece&s;&s;ary. Your rulers, it is true, were in&s;trumental in his death; but they were &s;o "becau&s;e they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the pro|phets which are read every &s;abbath-day;" yea, "the&s;e they fulfilled in condemning him."</P>
<P>NOT that the apo&s;tle Paul contented him&s;elf meerly with &s;peaking of the &s;uf|ferings of Chri&s;t as a nece&s;&s;ary fact, according to the prophe&s;ies of &s;cripture. He would have been very deficient in his di&s;cour&s;e, if he had gone no further. Without all doubt, he took care to let his hearers into the grand de&s;ign of the death of Chri&s;t; repre&s;enting its nece&s;&s;ity as an expedient contrived by the wi&s;dom of God to atone for the &s;ins of men, and in this way to procure their pardon. For this al&s;o was pointed out, though ob|&s;curely, in the old-te&s;tament books. The &s;acrifices under the law, the expiatory ones in &s;pecial, were, in the view of God, and the de&s;ign of their appointment, prefigurations of the death of Chri&s;t, as an offering and &s;acrifice to atone for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. And Paul, as he might with propriety and force, probably &s;pake to the&s;e Jews concerning the legal &s;acrifices in their reference to Chri&s;t as
<PB N="29" REF="010580_0027_0F80D0F8E0088020">
types and &s;hadows, which mu&s;t have been an&s;wered in him as the great propitiation for the &s;ins of men. And, as it was particu|larly prophe&s;ied by the prophet I&s;aiah, that "he &s;hould be wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, bear our iniquities, and make his &s;oul an offering for our &s;ins;" and by the pro|phet Daniel, that he &s;hould "fini&s;h tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, make an end of &s;in, and bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s;" he, doubtle&s;s, in his rea&s;oning from the&s;e texts, opened to them the great go&s;pel-doctrine of "forgive|ne&s;s through the blood of Chri&s;t." He did not meerly alledge and prove, that Chri&s;t had "&s;uffered according to the &s;cripture;" but that he "&s;uffered for &s;in, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t," that God might, in a way honorary to his perfections and government, di&s;pen&s;e forgive|ne&s;s to the &s;inful &s;ons of men. In a word, he &s;o rea&s;oned upon this &s;ubject of Chri&s;t's death, and the nece&s;&s;ity of it, as to open to his hearers tho&s;e great go&s;pel-truths which are connected there with, and dependent thereon, as the ba&s;is of our hope in the divine mercy for pardon and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>AND in this way ought go&s;pel-mini&s;ters in the&s;e days to preach upon the &s;ufferings and death of Chri&s;t. 'Tis not enough to tell peo|ple,
<PB N="30" REF="010580_0028_0F80D0F9B3111EC0">
that he "became obedient to death, the death of the cro&s;s;" or that, by dying, he confirmed the truth of the chri&s;tian revela|lation, and gave a perfect pattern of &s;uffer|ing graces. The&s;e things, it is acknowledged, are truths, and proper to be preached, and in their place ought to be preached. But they are truths of &s;mall importance in compari&s;on with the great doctrine of "remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins," as founded on the "propitiation" made for them by the "blood of Chri&s;t," when he was nailed to the cro&s;s. This was the grand point aimed at, by the wi&s;dom of God, in the &s;ufferings and death of his &s;on Je&s;us. And 'tis this that takes off the &s;candal of the cro&s;s, and repre&s;ents it as the re&s;ult of the allwi&s;e coun&s;el of the merciful God for the pardon of &s;inful men.</P>
<P>IN fine, another thing "opened and al|ledged" by the apo&s;tle Paul, in his preaching was, that "Chri&s;t mu&s;t needs have ri&s;en again from the dead." He probably placed before the view of his pre&s;ent hearers the evidence of the truth of the fact. This he did, when he preached upon the &s;ame &s;ubject to the people at Corinth. We have, from his own pen, a recapitulation of the proofs he offered for their conviction upon this head; as you
<PB N="31" REF="010580_0029_0F80D0FB0FB8AC68">
may read at large in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to them, the fifteenth chapter towards the beginning. But, be&s;ides the truth of the fact it&s;elf, he enlarged on the <HI>&s;criptural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity of it; making it indi&s;putably clear, by his rea&s;on|ing, that he "mu&s;t needs have ri&s;en from the dead," that the ancient prophe&s;ies fore|telling this event might have their accom|pli&s;hment. It would be needle&s;s, though it might be ea&s;y, to point out the particular texts, in the &s;acred books of the old-te&s;ta|ment, it is probable he argued from. The &s;um of his rea&s;oning might be to this effect. Let it not be thought an incredible thing among you, that Chri&s;t, after he had been dead, was rai&s;ed again to life. His death and re&s;urrection were in&s;eparably connected with each other in the plan of God, accor|ding to your own &s;criptures. The Me&s;&s;iah was "fir&s;t to &s;uffer, and then," by ri&s;ing from the dead, "to enter into glory." He could not have been the Chri&s;t of God, the Me&s;&s;iah de&s;cribed in the writings you ac|knowledge to be of divine authority, if what I preach to you is not the truth. By his &s;uffering death, you have a full completion of tho&s;e &s;cripture-prophe&s;ies, which mu&s;t have been fulfilled.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="010580_0030_0F80D0FB71AC00E0">
NOR did the apo&s;tle treat of the re&s;ur|rection of Chri&s;t meerly as a fact, or a fact in completion of the &s;criptures; but, if we may judge from his preaching upon this &s;ame article at other times, he con&s;idered it as a truth e&s;&s;entially connected with the honor of Chri&s;t, and the peculiar important doctrines of his religion. If Chri&s;t is not "ri&s;en from the dead," he was not the &s;on of God and Savior of men in reality and truth, but in pretence only.&mdash;If Chri&s;t is not "ri&s;en from the dead," we are "yet in our &s;ins;" as his death was not an atonement for them, to which God has te&s;tified his acceptance.&mdash;If Chri&s;t is not "ri&s;en from the dead," he could not be "the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;leep in him," the given pledge and a&s;&s;urance of their re&s;urrection to a glorious life that &s;hall never have an end.&mdash;If Chri&s;t is not "ri&s;en from the dead," he is not exalted at the right hand of God in heaven; he does not appear there as our advocate with the father, whom he heareth always; he is not the authori&s;ed king and judge of the world; nor is there any good rea&s;on to expect, that any of the &s;ons of Adam &s;hall be rewarded or puni&s;hed by him, "according to their deeds done in the body." In &s;hort, if Chri&s;t is not "ri&s;en from the dead," the whole

go&s;pel-&s;cheme of &s;alvation is a nullity. He "died in vain"; our "faith" in him as the Chri&s;t "is vain"; and &s;o is our "faith in any of the doctrines of his religion.</P>
<P>IT cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the apo&s;tle Paul, an extraordinary me&s;&s;enger of God, &s;hould; in treating on Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection from the dead, neglect to "open" this doc|trine in its nece&s;&s;ary connection with tho&s;e great truths of chri&s;tianity, which are de|pendant on it. We may be&s;ure, he not only affirmed, and proved, that that Je&s;us, who was once dead, is now alive; but that he is alive in heaven, the approbated Savior, and authori&s;ed interce&s;&s;or, king and judge of men, by whom they will all be rai&s;ed from the dead, and made happy, or mi&s;erable, in another world, as their character in this has been either good, or bad.</P>
<P>AND "Chri&s;t ri&s;en from the dead," with the great truths comprehended in it, are &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;i&s;ted on by tho&s;e who are go&s;pel-preachers: Nor will they de&s;erve this name, if they &s;eldom, or in a cur&s;ory way only, make them the &s;ubject of their di&s;|cour&s;es. The&s;e are doctrines that eminently reflect honor on Chri&s;t, and they enter deep
<PB N="34" REF="010580_0032_0F80D0FC9EBD52E0">
into the &s;cheme of divine mercy as it relates to man. They ought therefore to be the frequent theme of the pulpit. It will not &s;uffice, that they are mentioned only now and then, as it were by the bye; but they &s;hould often be enlarged on as truths highly worthy of the attention of hearers, and that need inculcation that their faith in them may be well rooted and e&s;tabli&s;hed. For their re|demption is as truly dependent on a "a ri&s;en and glorified" Chri&s;t, as a "crucified" one. They could no more have been &s;aved with|out the one than the other.</P>
<P>ONE of the brighte&s;t patterns of good preaching, both as to its MANNER and SUB|JECT-MATTER, has now been plainly, tho' imperfectly, &s;et before you. And it would be ea&s;y to &s;how, wherein we might all receive benefit from it, whether we &s;u&s;tain the cha|racter of &s;peakers, or hearers. But the time obliges me to confine what I would further &s;ay to the per&s;on, who may pre&s;ently be &s;e|perated to the go&s;pel-mini&s;try, and to the chri&s;tian &s;ociety of which he is to take the charge.</P>
<P>IT was, Sir, with a more &s;pecial eye to you, devoting your&s;elf this day to "the mini&s;try
<PB N="35" REF="010580_0033_0F80D10020B4D168">
of the word," that I &s;elected for improve|ment the noble pattern of good preaching that has been brought to view. Permit me to recommend it to your imitation. The copy was &s;et by an apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t, one immediately commi&s;&s;ioned by him, and that all along acted under his extraordinary guidance and direction. While therefore you conform your&s;elf to it, you will approve your&s;elf a good mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. You cannot, &s;peak to your people upon more proper &s;ub|jects than tho&s;e that were the main &s;cope of Paul's preaching. Your hearers indeed are chri&s;tians by profe&s;&s;ion; for which rea&s;on, you may, ordinarily, in your di&s;cour&s;es, take it for granted, that they are believers in "Je&s;us as the Chri&s;t:" Though, if you &s;ometimes enlarged on the evidences of this foundation-truth, it might be of good &s;er|vice. But you cannot dwell too much in your preaching upon the <HI>death</HI> and <HI>re&s;ur|rection</HI> of Chri&s;t. They are truths of e&s;&s;en|tial importance in the religion of Je&s;us. And they are comprehen&s;ive ones al&s;o; for they include in them the whole doctrine of the go&s;pel. It &s;hould be your great bu&s;ine&s;s to unfold their meaning in its ju&s;t latitude; and if you do this from the &s;criptures, making them your guide and rule, in all your rea&s;oning
<PB N="36" REF="010580_0034_0F80D100BAE06EF8">
upon them, you will declare to your people "the whole coun&s;el of God" relative to their &s;alvation; for it is all &s;ummarily contained in the&s;e articles; it is all deducible from them, and it has all been actually deduced by the &s;acred penman, in the new-te&s;tament-books.</P>
<P>You will imitate the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles in the manner of your preaching al|&s;o; making it your principal care to apply to the under&s;tandings and con&s;ciences of your hearers, and not to their pa&s;&s;ions and affections. You po&s;&s;e&s;s the intellectual powers in too great a degree to be in danger of turn|ing them off with loo&s;e, unconnected, empty harangues, which, if they &s;hould give heat, can convey little or no light; nor would they be ea&s;y under &s;uch preaching: They have been too much u&s;ed to another and more excellent way to be &s;o. This may po&s;|&s;ibly appear a di&s;advantage; you may be ready to think it had been better had it been your lot to &s;ucceed one not &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed as Doctor MAYHEW was known to be for his talents as a preacher, and that made &s;o con|&s;picuous a u&s;e of them; but it may be of &s;ervice to you, it can't fail of being &s;o, if you improve it as a &s;timulus to excite your
<PB N="37" REF="010580_0035_0F80D1016F724550">
ambition, and animate your endeavors to ex|cel as he did. With the apo&s;tle Paul, he con&s;idered his hearers as intelligent agents, and made it evident he entertained this opi|nion of them by forming his di&s;cour&s;es &s;o as to enlighten their minds in the knowledge of what he him&s;elf really believed, from the &s;criptures, to be "the truth as it is in Je&s;us" without adulteration. Go you, and do like|wi&s;e; making it your care, in preaching, not &s;o much to warm the affections of your hearers, as to touch their hearts by the light of truth, fetched from the &s;criptures as nearly as may be in its original purity. After the example of in&s;pired Paul, di&s;dain the u&s;e of craft to rai&s;e a u&s;ele&s;s, however plea&s;ing, heat in their pa&s;&s;ions; and allow not your&s;elf to &s;ub&s;titute "wi&s;dom of words," either in your compo|&s;ures, or the delivery of them, in the room of that &s;criptural, rational light, without which heat in the pa&s;&s;ions will do no good; yea, &s;hould it be rai&s;ed to too great an height, it would rather tend to make men wild, than religious; as has too often been the ca&s;e in fact. Let your "rea&s;onings out of the &s;criptures" be delivered from a heart deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of the infinite importance of go&s;pel-truths; and you will then naturally &s;peak in the be&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="010580_0036_0F80D101F03E5398">
adapted, and mo&s;t powerful manner, to ex|cite affection, &s;o far as it can be &s;erviceable to any of the purpo&s;es of real chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>AND you would do well to remember, that the apo&s;tle Paul was as bright a pattern of GOOD LIVING, as of good preaching. Often take a view of his character in this point of light. And if, by being a "a fol|lower of him as he was of Chri&s;t," your conduct is &s;uch as that you may be able to appeal to the con&s;ciences of your people, and &s;ay as he could, "you are witne&s;&s;es, and God al&s;o, how holily, and ju&s;tly, and un|blamably, I have behaved among you," it would e&s;tabli&s;h in their hearts a reverential love to you, and tend, more powerfully than you may be ready to imagine, to give life and efficacy to all your applications to them, whether public or private.</P>
<P>THE effect of your mi&s;&s;ion this day is a &s;ecret "hid in God." It may eventually turn out an occa&s;ion of making "hard hearts harder, and blind eyes blinder." An affecting thought this! but &s;hould not be too di&s;cou|raging. Prophets and apo&s;tles have mourned, that they &s;hould "labor in vain, and &s;pend their &s;trength for nought:" Yea, our Ma&s;ter and

Lord had rea&s;on to adopt that language of the prophet I&s;aiah, "who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" Even an un&s;ucce&s;sful mini&s;try &s;hould not therefore lie with two great weight upon your mind. But our hope is; that you are &s;ent of God to be his in&s;trument in beginning, and carrying on, in multitudes, the work of grace in this world, that they may be formed to a meetne&s;s for "the un-incorruptible inheritance re&s;erved in heaven for them." "For this cau&s;e, we bow our knees" in humble prayer "to the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" and, I doubt not, this great a&s;&s;embly unite as one in &s;aying, AMEN, &s;o be it, O Lord! But whether your &s;ucce&s;s in the go&s;pel-mini&s;try is great, or &s;mall; whether few are &s;aved by means of it, or many hardned; if you are faithful to Chri&s;t, and to the &s;ouls committed to your care, you will a&s;&s;uredly "be glorious in the eyes of the Lord."</P>
<P>Go forth, my &s;on, in the &s;trength of God. He that &s;ends you has &s;aid for your encou|ragement, "lo, I am with you alway." And if the great Savior is pre&s;ent with you to &s;upport, comfort, and help you, what &s;hould di&s;hearten you? Let nothing move you from

Bear with his infirmities; for, in common with others, he is a partaker of frail humanity.

<HEAD>THE Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip; By the Rev. Mr. APPLETON.</HEAD>
<P>THE grand De&s;ign of the GOSPEL MINISTRY &s;hows it to be an high and honorable, as well as holy Calling.

And yet, this &s;acred precious Trea&s;ure of the Go&s;pel we have in Earthen Ve&s;&s;els, that the Excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of Man. To &s;ome of the &s;inful Children of Men is this Grace given to preach the un&s;earchable Riches of Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>AND the Behaviour of the Apo&s;tles towards one another was but agreable hereto: For when <HI>James, Cephas,</HI> and <HI>John perceived the Grace;</HI> that is the Grace of the <HI>Apo&s;tle&s;hip</HI> which was given to <HI>Paul.</HI> That is, when they perceived that he was called and commi&s;&s;ioned to be an Apo&s;tle as much as they them&s;elves; they gave to <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> his Companion in the Mini&s;try, <HI>the Right Hands of Fellow&s;hip,</HI> as a public Sign and Token hereof.</P>
<P>AND altho' it is not pretended that this &s;ignifica|tive Action of the Apo&s;tle amounts to the force of a <HI>Precept</HI> or <HI>In&s;truction;</HI> yet we look upon this apo&s;tolical Precedent as that which very well war|rants the Cu&s;tom of the&s;e Churches upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion as this before us.</P>
