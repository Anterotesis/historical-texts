<HEAD>AN AFFECTIONATE ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear young Friends, fellow Members of the &s;ame Meeting,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not that &s;uitable advice has not been admini&s;tered to every &s;tate and condition, that induces me to make this addre&s;s; but as the connection between us may occa&s;ion this to be read, while advices more worthy may e&s;cape notice, I tru&s;t it will &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify me in thus at|tempting to impart &s;ome things, wherein I apprehend your pre&s;ent and future wel|fare is much concerned.</P>
<P>I would, however, fir&s;t premi&s;e, that all will allow the mo&s;t important concern to us, in this life, is to endeavour after &s;uch a &s;tate of mind, that we may be enabled &s;o to live and conduct our&s;elves in this world,
<PB N="6" REF="017968_0005_0FA409892AFB20C8">as that all our actions may tend to render us fit companions for men here, and for purified and ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits hereafter: our exi&s;tence will el&s;e be of no value, no other pur&s;uit being worthy our attention. The &s;olemn period, that will reduce every &s;tate, condition, and thing, to one level, is certain to us all; pro&s;perity and adver|&s;ity, riches and poverty, health and &s;ick|ne&s;s, however differently e&s;timated now, will then, in fact, admit of no choice or difference, or afford any comfort, other|wi&s;e than as &s;uch proper u&s;es have been made of them as may have promoted this great end: for if we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the highe&s;t degree of this world's good, or what is mo&s;t &s;ought after, viz. health, power, affluence, and plea&s;ure, and had not a better hope, we &s;hould be mo&s;t mi&s;erable; that which we feared to lo&s;e, and knew we mu&s;t lo&s;e, would take away the true enjoyment of every ble&s;&s;ing a&s;&s;orded by Divine Providence. On the contrary, did we but experience our minds redeemed from tran&s;itory things, and &s;ixed on the better hope, we &s;hould, as was te&s;tified of the meek, enjoy even the earth in a right and true manner; receiving with thankful hearts the mercies of the Almighty, u&s;ing this world as not abu&s;ing it, and not be
<PB N="7" REF="017968_0006_0FA4098A33EA6BA8">afraid, whenever it &s;hould plea&s;e him to call us hence, freely to re&s;ign up all. Hav|ing &s;aid this, I &s;hall now proceed, and hope to be enabled to convince you, that the profe&s;&s;ion of your education, becoming that of your judgment and practice, will, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, bring you into this happy &s;ituation, which both your greate&s;t intere&s;t and mo&s;t incumbent duty demand you earne&s;tly to &s;eek after. I need hardly a&s;k you the que&s;tion, "Your fathers, where are they, and the prophets, do they live for ever?" Zech. i. 5. You will readily an&s;wer, They are gone. What then? are the words they taught, and the &s;tatutes they were commanded by the Almighty, buried with them? I hope not. By whom then &s;hould the knowledge of them be pre|&s;erved? Surely by &s;uch as are left behind. And I pray that we, who are the natural branches, may not (through our di&s;regard thereto) lo&s;e our birthright for a mere me&s;s of pottage; (a poor temporary gratification) but, like the &s;ons of Jonadab, keep all their precepts: that the Lord of ho&s;ts, the God of I&s;rael, may not want a man of their po&s;terity to &s;tand before him for ever.</P>
<P>You need not be told, that they were very &s;ingular and different from others in their dre&s;s and addre&s;s; and, however
<PB N="8" REF="017968_0007_0FA40A10A4C285C0">light &s;ome may now e&s;teem the&s;e things, they &s;uffered greatly for the &s;ame, both in body and goods, and their &s;ufferings have opened to us a door of great liberty, but we do not, I fear, &s;ufficiently prize it: if we did, there would be no running back again into bondage. If the Hebrew who might have been free and would not, de|&s;erved to have his ear bored through with an awl, and be fixed in &s;lavery for ever, &s;uch back&s;liders certainly do. There is &s;uch a dignity in the truth, and &s;uch a nobility in appearing like friends agreeable to our known principles, that it keeps even tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors in awe, and libertines at a di&s;tance. A deviation opens a door to every hurtful thing, and introduces an acquaintance that oftentimes leads to ruin in this world, and, which is much wor&s;e, (though far be it from me to limit the mercies of the Almighty) unfits us, I fear, for happine&s;s in the world to come. My beloved young friends, do not plead for this or that, as &s;eeing no harm in it: ab|&s;tractedly con&s;idered, it may be indifferent, but, as it is connected, of the utmo&s;t im|portance. A cocked-up hat, fa&s;hionable cloaths, or u&s;ing the plural number in&s;tead of the &s;ingular, may be called by you in|different things; you may &s;ay that &s;peech
<PB N="9" REF="017968_0008_0FA40A11B61467F8">is to convey ideas, and what religion can there be in having a hat a little lower or higher? And in the &s;ame manner plead for every other liberty; but indeed the&s;e are very far from being indifferent things to us. The&s;e &s;ingularities, as you may call them, are like the locks of Samp&s;on's hair, wherein if we &s;uffer our&s;elves by any Delilah to be deceived, and depart from the plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of our profe&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall lo&s;e our &s;trength, and become weak as other men: who, &s;eeing us in their &s;tate, will &s;oon entice us into tho&s;e things I have hinted at. I do not, however, by this mean to be under&s;tood, that we are to lay &s;uch a &s;tre&s;s on an external appearance, as in any-wi&s;e to neglect what is internal. Make the in&s;ide clean, and the out&s;ide will be clean al&s;o. Our predece&s;&s;ors in the truth, we know, from well-grounded ob|jections, laid a&s;ide greatly the exteriors men had added to religion, and recom|mended to us an inward purity of heart and &s;oul. If therefore, we become dead to the power of truth, having neither form nor power, we are &s;o far from ex|ceeding other profe&s;&s;ions, that, in my opi|nion, we fall greatly &s;hort. I pray it may not be &s;o with us; but, as our fathers before us walked in the truth, that we
<PB N="10" REF="017968_0009_0FA40A126DC44348">may likewi&s;e &s;o walk; and have to &s;ay to them that &s;ucceed us, follow us as we have followed them, who followed the Lord Je&s;us in truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. May you al&s;o be examples to the youth in other meetings; that they, beholding your circum&s;pection, and the fear of God im|pre&s;&s;ed on your minds, may be encouraged to tread in the &s;ame path. Never be a&s;hamed of being religious. I have thought nothing ever advanced the character of David more, than that zealous joyful &s;elf|aba&s;ement which appeared in his dancing before the ark: and though, by the &s;pirit of the world, &s;uch may be de&s;pi&s;ed, as act|ing too mean a part for the dignity of human pride, yet by the upright-hearted they will be had in honour, and their &s;ouls &s;hall be &s;atisfied as with marrow and fat|ne&s;s, and know a growing in that which is truly good; when leanne&s;s and barrenne&s;s &s;hall attend the &s;coffers, who at length &s;hall be made to confe&s;s, Wi&s;d. v. 4, 5. "We fools accounted their life madne&s;s, and their end to be without honour. How are they numbered among&s;t the children of God, and their lot is among&s;t the &s;aints? What hath pride profited us, or what good hath riches and vaunting brought us? All the&s;e things are pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="11" REF="017968_0010_0FA40A1332A28E10">away like as a &s;hadow, and as a po&s;t that ha&s;teth by, and we are now con&s;umed in our own wickedne&s;s. But the righteous live for evermore, even they whom we had &s;ometimes in deri&s;ion, and a proverb of reproach: their reward is with the Lord, and the care of the Mo&s;t High is over them." Thus by acting in character, agreeable to your profe&s;&s;ion, you will gain all things; and out of it, lo&s;e all. For what advantage can the whole world af|ford, or any thing therein, when the time comes, which is mo&s;t &s;ure, that we &s;hall have but one de&s;ire, even to die the death of the righteous, and our latter end to be like unto theirs, &s;o emphatically &s;et forth in the foregoing pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>I would now &s;et before you &s;ome out|ward advantages you enjoy &s;uperior to many of your brethren; and pre&s;s that proper u&s;e to be made of them which may further this great purpo&s;e of life&mdash;To fini&s;h well. Our meeting has been favour|ed with a living, acceptable mini&s;try: many watering &s;ea&s;ons we have had, here a little and there a little. The&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are not to be lightly e&s;teemed; nor are we &s;o to depend on them, as to neglect in any wi&s;e our attention to that great Mini&s;ter, to
<PB N="12" REF="017968_0011_0FA40A13E71D2E00">whom both tho&s;e that edify and tho&s;e that are edified are &s;ervants. If we do, we &s;hall &s;uffer great lo&s;s; and as, on a certain oc|ca&s;ion, the Almighty &s;aid to Mo&s;es, "They are thy people, not mine," may it not be applicable to us? A lamentable exchange or difference, to become the children of men, from being children taught by the Mo&s;t High, and in his truth e&s;tabli&s;hed. The end of all true mini&s;try is to direct to this; and the &s;oftening &s;howers of the go&s;pel are to water the heritage, that the good ground being opened thereby, the true &s;eed may take root and grow up, bringing forth an increa&s;e proportionate to the talent received: in &s;ome thirty, &s;ome &s;ixty, and &s;ome an hundred-fold. The frequent opportunities afforded us to meet together, are al&s;o great advantages; I do intreat you, by no means neglect them. It is great encouragement to &s;ee a meeting well and timely filled. I remember to have heard a friend once &s;ay in te&s;timony, "That &s;uch as were indifferent about coming to meetings, were mo&s;t indifferent when there." This is a truth to which I believe our ex|perience will readily a&s;&s;ent. Let us there|fore in an e&s;pecial manner guard again&s;t this indifference; and though we may have attended many meetings, and &s;eem to
<PB N="13" REF="017968_0012_0FA40A14DA309AE8">be neverthele&s;s in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate, and hardly to know what good is, yet if we mi&s;s but one, that one might have been to us as the appearance of Je&s;us was to the di&s;ciples when they were very low in their minds. He then &s;tood in the mid&s;t of them, and &s;aid, "Peace be unto you;" he &s;hewed them his hands and his, &s;ide, and they were glad; he al&s;o breathed on them, and they received the Holy Gho&s;t. Ob|&s;erve, from this memorable meeting one di&s;ciple was ab&s;ent, and the report from others could not make him believe; and though our Lord, in conde&s;cen&s;ion, af|forded him another opportunity, when he could only cry out, "My Lord, and my God!" yet are we not to pre&s;ume upon that, but cry earne&s;tly to be endued with ability to perform the pre&s;ent duty in the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>Be exceeding choice of your company; for true it is, that evil communications corrupt good manners. Be as careful what books you read; and avoid tho&s;e in the lea&s;t tending to libertini&s;m and dei&s;m, as you would an infectious di&s;temper. Man, by all his earthly wi&s;dom, cannot find out God; finite cannot comprehend infinite. In his unregenerate &s;tate, man
<PB N="14" REF="017968_0013_0FA40A17E6EF71B8">may puzzle and perplex him&s;elf with mat|ters too high for him. Meddle not there|with, but ever bear in remembrance, "The man that walketh uprightly, walketh &s;e|curely;" and that to &s;uch as "walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit, there is no condemnation." This is enough for us to believe and practi&s;e; let us leave the re&s;t to the all wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of all things, and &s;ay with David, "He that planted the ear, &s;hall he not hear? He that formed the eye, &s;hall he not &s;ee? And he that teacheth men knowledge, &s;hall he not know?"</P>
<P>After reque&s;ting your frequent peru&s;al of the holy &s;criptures, I would in a particular manner recommend to your reading the &s;everal volumes, intituled, Piety Promoted. What can more excite to piety, than to view men in their expiring moments joy|fully leaving this world, from a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of a life &s;pent in the fear of God? a time in which no dazzling object can de|ceive, or any worldly enjoyment flatter. William Penn's Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s, wrote by way of preface to George Fox's jour|nal, Dr. Rutty's Liberty of the Fle&s;h and Spirit di&s;tingui&s;hed, and John Fry's Serious and Affectionate Addre&s;s, I would al&s;o wi&s;h
<PB N="15" REF="017968_0014_0FA40A194C4B00D0">you all often to read, and &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider. The many journals left by wor|thy decea&s;ed friends will afford both de|light and profit; the experiences of great and good men being by the wi&s;e always had in e&s;teem. I am not in&s;en&s;ible, whil&s;t I thus recommend the examples of others, that great hurt hath been occa&s;ioned by the falling away of &s;ome men, from whom better things might have been expected, and that by their fall many have been wounded. I confe&s;s this is a lamentable circum&s;tance; but &s;hould thou&s;ands fall on the right, and ten thou&s;ands on the left-hand, truth is truth; and may the failures of others tend to make us more circum&s;pect and careful of our&s;elves, and quicken our endeavours, to the utmo&s;t of the ability afforded us, to be &s;tedfa&s;t, im|moveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord: ever bearing in remem|brance, that the be&s;t of men are no longer &s;afe than whil&s;t on their guard; that the higher the attainment, the greater the fall; and that if the light that was once in us becomes darkne&s;s, that darkne&s;s is great indeed! And as, in the outward, when a man becomes blind, after having once &s;een, the lo&s;s of &s;ight is more &s;everely felt by him than by a per&s;on born blind; &s;o
<PB N="16" REF="017968_0015_0FA40A1A7798E130">when tho&s;e who have once &s;piritually &s;een afterwards fall into blindne&s;s, it is no marvel that the &s;tate of &s;uch &s;hould be wor&s;e than that of tho&s;e who have not been &s;o enlightened. I have &s;een &s;o much hurt &s;u&s;tained by &s;ome who have begun right, by not keeping to the &s;implicity and innocency they once knew and began in, that I cannot but greatly de&s;ire our pre&s;ervation and per&s;everance: and that with Jo&s;hua we may re&s;olve, That, let others do what they will, we will to the utmo&s;t of our power follow on to know and &s;erve the Lord.</P>
<P>It is a &s;hort time we have to be here, even the younge&s;t: it will &s;oon pa&s;s over, and flee as a &s;hadow, or as a po&s;t that ha&s;teth by. How many &s;trong per&s;ons do we &s;ee unexpectedly called away? Have we not had in our own meeting very recent in&s;tances? By the records of our burials, I find in one month buried four young men, aged 28, 20, 18, and 17 years, and two in the 37th year. Were we con|&s;tantly to con&s;ider our latter end, it might tend greatly to make us wi&s;e, and &s;up|pre&s;s every inordinate de&s;ire. As I have dwelt pretty largely on this &s;ubject in the beginning of this addre&s;s, I &s;hall not add
<PB N="17" REF="017968_0016_0FA40A1AB663B8A8">much; my end in re&s;uming it being rather to &s;et before us the uncertainty when, than the certainty of our di&s;&s;olution: being &s;en&s;ible of our aptne&s;s to put &s;uch con&s;i|derations afar off, e&s;pecially in the young, the healthy, and the &s;trong. But although the aged mu&s;t die, the young may, and we &s;ee they do. How greatly, how e&s;&s;entially then doth it behove us to walk circum|&s;pectly, not as fools, but like wi&s;e men, redeeming our time. It was nobly re|&s;olved by one of old, who &s;aid, "All the days of my appointed time I will wait, until my change come." May you all be like minded: it will tend, I believe, to make your life comfortable, and your latter end peace.</P>
<P>As to your demeanour in your outward affairs, nothing can &s;o perfectly direct you therein, as keeping to the truth; nor can any thing el&s;e enable you to bear di&s;ap|pointments, which will unavoidably hap|pen. Some points, however, it may not be ami&s;s to mention. Treat all, with whom you have to do, with meekne&s;s and calmne&s;s: a &s;oft an&s;wer turns away anger, and a wrong is &s;ooner redre&s;&s;ed and ac|knowledged through a mild conduct than repreach. Imitate not tho&s;e in an higher
<PB N="18" REF="017968_0017_0FA40A1B75CEBFF0">&s;phere of life. Endeavour to live rather below than above your &s;ituations. I have often &s;een exceeding hurt to individuals in this particular, who might have been very comfortable, had they confined their way of life to their &s;ituation in it; but, by looking and aiming at an higher, have, to &s;upport it, gone into hazardous undertak|ings, brought very great inconveniency on them&s;elves; and then have been ready to complain, and think their lot hard. An|other thing I would ob&s;erve to tho&s;e in &s;mall circum&s;tances, who may be in trades and bu&s;ine&s;s, that they do not tru&s;t their affairs in the hands of &s;uch as are likewi&s;e but of &s;mall circum&s;tances. Men of greater may run hazards not ju&s;tifiable in them: if they have le&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s on account of their caution, it is to be preferred, rather than to ri&s;que the little they have, where there may be a danger.</P>
<P>And &s;uch of you as may earn your bread with the &s;weat of your brow, repine not at it. Remember, that godline&s;s with con|tentment is great gain. Providence, in the all-wi&s;e di&s;po&s;al of things, has more equal|ly be&s;towed his gifts than men perceive. The poor are exempt from many watch|ings, toils, and fatigues, which the rich
<PB N="19" REF="017968_0018_0FA40A1C34D9E458">experience; their food is plea&s;ant, and their re&s;t &s;weet. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the truth will make all conditions happy; and with|out it all is confu&s;ion. The poor in this world, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e greater riches, will not repine for want of the le&s;&s;er: their bread will be &s;ure, and their water never fail, and they &s;hall not even want outward bread. It will be a ble&s;&s;ing to have to ad|mini&s;ter to &s;uch; and although at times their difficulties may appear great, &s;uch will remember what the apo&s;tle &s;aith, "That the time is &s;hort, that they that weep be as though they wept not; and they that re|joice as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy as though they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not:" and further, what he wrote to Timothy. "We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out; and hav|ing food and raiment, let us be therewith content." Thus is verified what the &s;ame apo&s;tle wrote to his &s;ame beloved Timothy, "Godline&s;s is profitable unto all things, having the promi&s;e of the life that now is, (through contentment) and of that which is to come" (by its effects.)</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enlarge; a few &s;hort hints may be better remembered than longer di&s;|cour&s;es; nor have I any de&s;ire to appear
<PB N="20" REF="017968_0019_0FA40A1D304EB300">in this public manner: for could I have conveyed the&s;e advices as from an anony|mous writer, it would have &s;uited my own inclination better; but I could not &s;ee how that might be done, &s;o as to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed. Finally, therefore, let me recommend to you, my dear young friends, in the words of the apo&s;tle, "that ye be kindly-affectioned one to another in bro|therly love, in honour preferring one an|other, and the God of love and peace be with you all. Amen.</P>

<P>The fruit of the &s;pirit is love, joy, peace, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, temperance: again&s;t &s;uch there is no law.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET me reque&s;t your attention to the following lines. The &s;ubject nearly concerns you.&mdash;De&s;pi&s;e not the coun&s;el of One who has often looked upon you with tender regard, and been &s;ecretly engaged on your account, that the many gracious vi&s;itations of Divine love and mercy to you might be affectionately received, and duly prized by you. If you &s;incerely em|brace them in humble re&s;ignation, and faithful obedience, the power of Truth will pre&s;erve you, and the fre&s;h &s;prings of life increa&s;e, and e&s;tabli&s;h you in the
<PB N="30" REF="017968_0028_0FA40A26ACCC7D98">&s;aving knowledge of God; but if you chu&s;e the ways of the world, and walk after the &s;ight of your eyes, and the ima|ginations of your hearts, rejecting the gentle drawings and inward reproofs of his Holy Spirit, you not only for&s;ake your own mercies for lying vanities, but al&s;o put a high indignity and affront upon the Sovereign Maje&s;ty, the great Judge of the quick and dead, who is every where a pre|&s;ent Ob&s;erver of our conduct, and too jealous of his honour to &s;uffer, without di&s;plea&s;ure, the froward will of the crea|ture to have the preference in any, to his ju&s;t and holy will; and who will not force tho&s;e into felicity who refu&s;e his gracious offers.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s you take up your daily cro&s;s to &s;elfi&s;h indulgencies and carnal gratifications, you cannot be the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, nor inherit tho&s;e enjoyments which are of a divine and permanent nature. <Q>If ye live after the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall die; but if "ye through the Spirit do mortify the "deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live. For "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the &s;ons, or children, of God.</Q> Rom. viii. To follow the Lamb, whither|&s;oever he leads, is the only way to true and la&s;ting happine&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="31" REF="017968_0029_0FA40A2782F3EF88">deceitful flatteries of a degenerate world, and the delu&s;ive per&s;ua&s;ions of corrupt na|ture to the contrary.</P>
<P>The &s;ubtil enemy of your peace begins with fair &s;hews and plau&s;ible temptations, in things which, to inexperienced minds, appear of &s;mall concern. He knows, &s;hould he at once attempt you with mani|fe&s;t iniquities and obvious impieties, it would &s;hock your tenderne&s;s, and defeat his de&s;tructive intentions. He therefore &s;eeks fir&s;t to en&s;nare you, by &s;ecretly opera|ting upon the complacency of your natural tempers, and your aver&s;ion to give di&s;gu&s;t, by putting forward and heightening your natural de&s;ires, rather to plea&s;e than profit your&s;elves and others, in your deportment and conver&s;e; and al&s;o to betray you into an ill-grounded &s;hame of godly conver&s;a|tion, and pious walking, and a breach of the due adherence to tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing peculiarities which the Truth has led its faithful followers into, and placed as an exterior hedge of pre&s;ervation about them. The&s;e the blind world calls affected &s;ingu|larities, and clowni&s;h ab&s;urdities, and &s;tyles the di&s;regard and di&s;u&s;e of them an innocent freedom, and prudent demeanor. Thus the in&s;iduous adver&s;ary leads fir&s;t in|to
<PB N="32" REF="017968_0030_0FA40A283AD4B6F8">partial compliances, and proceeds by making every &s;ucceeding &s;tep towards a captivating conformity, appear trivial, and of no con&s;equence. By this means he de|ludes the weak and unwary gradually to a&s;&s;imilate with the world, in language, in dre&s;s, in behaviour, in the &s;uperfluity and folly of its modes and fa&s;hions, in its cor|rupt a&s;&s;ociations, and poi&s;onous diver&s;ions, the natural tendency of all which is to entangle, darken, and deba&s;e the mind, and by alienating it from the light and life of Chri&s;t, to render it &s;o unguarded as to make way for the introduction of un&s;uita|ble connections, unhappy marriages, and, in brief, every kind of corruption and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Be intreated therefore to beware, in time, of every approach towards a fal&s;e liberty in the &s;malle&s;t matters, le&s;t they prove introductions to greater. Guard &s;trictly again&s;t every thing that would lead you to &s;light the tender touches and con|victions of Divine Grace. Withdraw from alluring objects. To tamper at all with temptations, is to lo&s;e ground. It is vain to imagine you can go what length you plea&s;e, and no further; that you may &s;e|curely temporize to a certain degree, or
<PB N="33" REF="017968_0031_0FA40A28E72B2D08">to ju&s;t &s;uch a plea&s;ing point of compliance as you are now tempted to, in behaviour, dre&s;s, and language, in order to appear genteel, candid, well bred, intelligent, polite, and to e&s;cape the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;a|tions of fal&s;e &s;hame, and the reflections of being &s;tupid, muli&s;h, and Quaker-like. This leads into liberty, but it is the liberty of the fle&s;h, which is in reality the bondage of corruption.</P>
<P>Content not your&s;elves with a birth in the Society; but &s;eek to &s;ecure a birthright in the Truth; without which the fir&s;t will not avail you in the &s;ight of God. Let the Spirit of Truth govern your inclinations; for whatever inclination you give your affection to, or pa&s;&s;ionately e&s;pou&s;e, will prove your ma&s;ter. Indulge not an eager curio&s;ity; it led Dinah to di&s;honour, and became the ruin of a city. Be cautious of your company; for that will affect both your manners and character, and eventual|ly your future &s;tate. Humor not the car|nal mind in dre&s;&s;ing your mortal, change|able, uncertain bodies, beyond what truth warrants, and decency requires; for more is not decoration, but di&s;gui&s;e, which in the ultimate runs into deformity, and ad|mini&s;ters offence to him who re&s;i&s;teth the
<PB N="34" REF="017968_0032_0FA40A2A485A1B78">proud, but increa&s;eth grace to the humble. Flatter not the vanity of tho&s;e who look for a plural addre&s;s to them&s;elves, whil&s;t they treat their Maker in the &s;ingular num|ber; as if Infinite Omnipotence was le&s;s, or le&s;s worthy, than the poor creature, who&s;e very breath and being is not one moment at his own di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>I would be&s;eech you, who are con&s;cious that you have already been turned a&s;ide or &s;tumbled at the cro&s;s, proceed no further, but fly to the great Redeemer, who &s;o won|derfully conde&s;cended from the heights of immortal Glory, took a painful humanity upon him, and bled for us, that he might bring us to cele&s;tial enjoyments, and for that end trod the mo&s;t thorny paths, and left us the faire&s;t example of humility, meekne&s;s, re&s;ignation, purity, and the mo&s;t perfect plainne&s;s in every re&s;pect. Slight not the pattern he &s;et, but follow it, for his ble&s;&s;ed &s;ake, and the &s;ecurity of your own happine&s;s; &s;hun all the gilded baits, the fair &s;eeming care&s;&s;es of a delu&s;ive world, in &s;mall matters as well as great, for they are all one in nature, tho' different in degree. Beware of the little foxes; they crop the tender buddings of the vine of life. Studiou&s;ly avoid all friend&s;hips, flatteries,

<P>Who, in their proper &s;en&s;es, would lo&s;e an eternal man&s;ion in the heavenly Jeru&s;a|lem and paradi&s;e of God, for the paltry plea&s;ures and &s;illy &s;atisfactions which mu&s;t &s;hortly end in everla&s;ting bitterne&s;s?

Make not &s;o mi&s;erable a choice and preference, but practically adopt this apo&s;tolic advice, <Q>Be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by "the renewing of your minds, that ye "may prove what is that good and accept|able, and perfect will God.</Q> Rom. xii.</P>
