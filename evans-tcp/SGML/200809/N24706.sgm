<P>THE following hi&s;tory was written many years ago, as mentioned in the title page;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The de&s;ign.</NOTE> but the great change in this country, which en&s;ued, and was then forming, prevented the publication. It was not only intended more particularly for the u&s;e of the de&s;cendants of the fir&s;t and early &s;ettlers of the province, but al&s;o for a general information to all others, re&s;pecting its former &s;tate, &amp;c. that by be|holding the means, by which &s;mall things become great, and what formerly made the country happy, it might excite a &s;imilar conduct in po&s;terity, &amp;c.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Pu&s;ey &amp; fir&s;t collec|tors of the memorials, &amp;c.</NOTE>Among the fir&s;t collectors of the&s;e materials ap|pears to have been <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey,</HI> one of the early &s;ettlers of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> from about London, in 1682; who, at different times, was both of the provincial and proprietary's, or governor's, coun|cil, and frequently in the a&s;&s;embly. He lived many years; was well acquainted with the public affairs, and &s;aw great improvements in the pro|vince. His papers after his decea&s;e, in 1725, were delivered to <HI>David Lloyd</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac Norris;</HI> and afterwards to <HI>James Logan,</HI> about the year 1732. From the&s;e per&s;ons, who made &s;uch additions, as came within their ob&s;ervation, they afterwards pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>John Kin&s;ey;</HI> who, in conjunction with &s;everal others, his friends, revi&s;ed them; and they remained in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till his death, in the year 1750.</P>
<P>The character of the&s;e per&s;ons, above mentioned, who, at different periods of time, filled &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent public &s;tations in the province, will further appear in the en&s;uing hi&s;tory; as be|ing men who had not only the be&s;t opportunity of knowing the variety of incidents, and the true &s;tate of its internal affairs, from the beginning, but al&s;o were them&s;elves actively concerned in a large &s;hare of the public tran&s;actions; and &s;ome of them, in the different intere&s;ts both of the proprietary and of his oppo&s;ers.</P>

Smith's manu&s;cript, but al&s;o divers particulars therein, are here much abbreviated, e&s;pecially re&s;pecting the long and tedious di&s;putes between &s;ome of the governors and a&s;&s;emblies; and con&s;iderable addi|tions are made, from other accounts, of &s;uch things as were either not at all touched upon, or but &s;light|ly mentioned, by him; be&s;ides mo&s;t of the notes, with the <HI>introduction,</HI> and the <HI>de&s;cription</HI> of the pro|vince and its <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate,</HI> between the years 1760 and 1770; both which la&s;t, not being attempted by him, are, for the mo&s;t part, entirely new:&mdash;So that the whole comprizes, be&s;ides what may be found of veracity, in other publications, re&s;pect|ing the province, a true and genuine narrative of the different public tran&s;actions, the great and va|rious improvements, memorable incidents, enter|taining anecdotes, and things worthy to be known, for above &s;ixty years, be&s;ides the &s;aid <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

The&s;e are &s;ins again&s;t nature; and again&s;t the government, as well as again&s;t the written laws of God. They lay the ax to the root of human &s;ociety; and are the common enemies of mankind.

<P>"Nothing (continues he) weakens kingdoms like vice; it does not only di&s;plea&s;e Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great im|portance of virtue, &amp;c.</NOTE> but di&s;able them;"&mdash;"It is our intere&s;t to be good; and it is none of the lea&s;t arguments for religion, that the piety and practice of it is the peace and pro&s;perity of government; and con&s;equently that vice, the enemy of religion, is, at the &s;ame time, the enemy of human &s;ociety. What, then, &s;hould be more concerned for the pre&s;ervation of virtue, than government? that, in its ab&s;tract, and true &s;en&s;e, is not only founded upon virtue, but with|out the pre&s;ervation of virtue, it is impo&s;&s;ible to maintain the be&s;t con&s;titution, that can be made. And, however &s;ome particular men may pro&s;per that are wicked, and &s;ome private good men mi&s;|carry, in the things of this world, in which &s;en&s;e, things may be &s;aid to happen alike to all, <HI>to the righteous as to the wicked,</HI> yet I dare boldly affirm, and challenge any man to the truth thereof; that, in the many volumes of the hi&s;tory of all ages and kingdoms of the world, there is not one in&s;tance to be found, where the hand of God was again&s;t a righteous nation, or when the hand of God was not again&s;t an unrighteous nation, fir&s;t or la&s;t; nor where a ju&s;t government peri&s;hed, nor an unju&s;t government long pro&s;pered. Kingdoms are rarely &s;o &s;hort lived as men; yet they al&s;o have a time to die; but as temperance giveth health to men, &s;o virtue gives time to kingdoms; and as vice brings men betimes to their graves, &s;o nations to their ruin."</P>

Governments, like clocks, go from the motion, which men give them; and as governments are made and moved by men, &s;o by them are they ruined too: wherefore govern|ments rather depend upon men, than men upon governments. Let men be good and the govern|ment cannot be bad; if it be ill they will cure it: but if men be bad, let the government be never &s;o good, they will endeavour to warp and &s;poil it to their turn."&mdash;"That, therefore, which makes a good con&s;titution, mu&s;t keep it, <HI>viz.</HI> men of wi&s;dom and virtue; qualities, that, becau&s;e they de&s;cend not with worldly inheritances, mu&s;t be carefully pro|pagated by a <HI>virtuous education of youth;</HI> for which after ages will owe more to the care and prudence of founders, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive <HI>magi&s;tracy,</HI> than to their parents, for their private <HI>patrimonies."</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great im|portance of good edu|cation.</NOTE>"I would think (&s;ays he in another place) that there are but few people &s;o vicious, as to care to &s;ee their children &s;o; and yet to me it &s;eems a plain ca&s;e, that, as we leave the government, they will find it: if &s;ome effectual cour&s;e be not taken, what with neglect, and what with example, impiety and the mi&s;eries that follow it, will be entailed upon our children. Certainly it were better the world ended with us, than that we &s;hould tran&s;mit our vices, or &s;ow tho&s;e evil &s;eeds, in our day, that will ripen to their ruin, and fill our country with mi&s;e|ries, after we are gone; thereby expo&s;ing it to the cur&s;e of God, and violence of our neighbours. But it is an infelicity we ought to bewail, that men are apt to prefer the ba&s;e plea&s;ures of their pre&s;ent extravagances to all endeavours after a future

<P>"Upon the whole matter (continues he) I take the freedom to &s;ay, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good edu|cation con|ducive to good go|vernment.</NOTE> if we would pre&s;erve our government, we mu&s;t endear it to the people.

I &s;ay, the government is highly obliged: it is a &s;ort of tru&s;tee for the youth of the kingdom; who, though now minors, yet will have the government, when we are gone. Therefore <HI>depre&s;s vice,</HI> and <HI>cheri&s;h virtue;</HI> that through <HI>good education,</HI> they may become good; which will truly render them happy in this world, and a good way fitted for that which is to come.

<P>Such maxims and advice are of univer&s;al con|cernment, and intere&s;ting to all governments;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men's opi|nions vary much, &amp;c.</NOTE> but the opinions of different men frequently vary much on the &s;ame &s;ubjects; and that, even, on impor|tant as well as trifling affairs; and their conduct is no le&s;s contradictory, and &s;ometimes &s;eemingly ir|rational; they are &s;o liable to embrace oppo&s;ite ex|tremes, that they often deviate from the middle way of rectitude: Hence, while the forward, &s;elfi&s;h and le&s;s qualified, frequently from &s;ini&s;ter, or mean views, &s;olicit and &s;ucceed into the public offices and magi&s;tracy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some cau|&s;es of de|fect in go|vernment and magi|&s;tracy, &amp;c.</NOTE> as well as into divers other important departments of life, for which they are unfit and improper, it is to be regretted, that &s;ometimes the more worthy, and better qualified, who are actu|ated, in what they do, by more generous principles, too often from diffidence of their own abilities,

This ap|pears to be the office of hi&s;tory; by which every &s;ucceeding age may avail it&s;elf of the wi&s;dom, and, even, of the folly, of the preceding, and become wi&s;er and happier by a proper application.

this medium when we view the conduct of tho&s;e great men of antiquity, who have benefited man|kind, in their mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts, they ap|pear frequently to have been actuated by motives, the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted, and attended with a &s;atisfac|tion more than human!&mdash;Adver&s;ity, which refines men, and renders them more fit to benefit the hu|man race, is a frequent concomitant of worthy minds; and apparent &s;ucce&s;s doth not always imme|diately attend noble and ju&s;t de&s;igns:&mdash;When a <HI>So|crates</HI> is put to death, wi&s;dom and truth &s;eem to &s;uf|fer; and when an <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> is exiled, ju&s;tice appears to be in di&s;grace.

<P>Thirdly, <HI>Not fighting, but &s;uffering,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They did not fight but &s;uffer, &amp;c.</NOTE> is another te&s;timony, peculiar to this people, in the words of <HI>W. Penn, viz.</HI> "They affirm, That <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> teacheth people to <HI>beat their &s;words into plow&s;hares,</HI> and <HI>their &s;pears into pruning hooks, and to learn war no more; that &s;o the wolf may lie down with the lamb, and the lion with the calf, and nothing that de&s;troys be entertained in the hearts of the people:</HI> exhorting them to employ their zeal again&s;t <HI>&s;in,</HI> and turn their anger again&s;t <HI>Satan,</HI> and no longer war one again&s;t another; becau&s;e <HI>all wars and fightings</HI> come of men's own hearts lu&s;ts, according to the apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> and not of the meek &s;pirit of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> who is captain of another <HI>warfare;</HI> and which is carried on with other weapons. Thus, as <HI>truth &s;peaking</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>&s;wearing,</HI> &s;o <HI>faith and patience</HI> &s;ucceeded fighting, in the doctrine and practice of this people. Nor ought they, for this, to be ob|noxious to civil government; &s;ince if they cannot <HI>fight for it,</HI> neither can they <HI>fight again&s;t it;</HI> which is no mean &s;ecurity to any &s;tate: nor is it rea&s;on|able that people &s;hould be blamed for not doing more for others, than they can do for them&s;elves. And, Chri&s;tianity &s;et a&s;ide, if the co&s;ts and fruits of war were well con&s;idered, peace, with all its in|conveniencies, is generally preferable. And though they were not for <HI>fighting,</HI> they were for <HI>&s;ubmitting</HI> to government; and that not only for <HI>fear,</HI> but for <HI>con&s;cience &s;ake,</HI> where government doth not in|terfere with con&s;cience; believing it to be an ordi|nance

of God, and where it is ju&s;tly admini&s;tered, a great benefit to mankind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is ob&s;ervable, that though they ab&s;olutely declined all military &s;er|vice, not only in their per&s;ons, but al&s;o in their refu&s;ing to procure &s;ub|&s;titutes, or others, in their room, by hiring, or in anywi&s;e paying, or contributing for the per&s;onal &s;ervice of &s;uch for them, in that capacity, or for any particular military purpo&s;e &s;olely; yet in all other re&s;pects, they punctually and willingly paid their taxes, though of a mixed nature, that is both military and civil, for the &s;upport of government, as before ob&s;erved.

<P>Concerning this point it may be further ob&s;erved from <HI>R. Barclay, viz.</HI>&mdash;"For it is as ea&s;y to ob|&s;cure the &s;un, at mid-day, as to deny that the pri|mitive Chri&s;tians renounced all revenge and fight|ing, and although this thing be &s;o much known, yet it is as well knows, that almo&s;t all the modern &s;ects live in the neglect and contempt of this law of Chri&s;t, and likewi&s;e oppre&s;s others, who in this agree not with them, for con&s;cience &s;ake towards God: even, as we have &s;uffered much in this our own country, becau&s;e we could neither our&s;elves bear arms, nor &s;end others in our places, nor give our money for the buying of drums, &s;tandards, and other military attire. And la&s;tly, becau&s;e we could not hold our doors, windows and &s;hops clo&s;e, for con&s;ci|ence &s;ake, upon &s;uch days as fa&s;ts and prayers were appointed, to de&s;ire a ble&s;&s;ing upon, and &s;ucce&s;s for, the arms of the kingdom, or commonwealth, under which we live; neither give thanks for the victories acquired by the effu&s;ion of much blood. By which forcing of the con&s;cience they would have con&s;trained our brethren, living in divers kingdoms at war together, to have implored our God for contrary and contradictory things, and con&s;equently impo&s;&s;ible; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that two

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The la&s;t thing I &s;hall mention under this <HI>head,</HI> is <HI>their maintaining all their own poor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their cha|rity to the poor, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>at their own expence;</HI> or, without being chargeable to others, be&s;ides contributing towards the &s;upport of the poor of other &s;ocieties, equally with them|&s;elves, in all common <HI>poor rates</HI> or <HI>taxes:</HI> in&s;o|much that no &s;uch thing as a common beggar was permitted, or known, to be among them, of that &s;ociety. For, as they &s;uffered none of their &s;oci|ety to be in &s;o nece&s;&s;itous a condition, as others, &s;o they were &s;o careful in the education of their chil|dren and youth, that there were none among them, brought up without a competency of u&s;eful and plain learning; the&s;e things being annually and methodically enquired into, and &s;trictly practi&s;ed through the whole &s;ociety, in every place. Thus, while, in the&s;e important matters, they were no ways burthen&s;ome to others, and while they con|tributed to other &s;ocieties equally with them&s;elves, in paying all <HI>poor rates</HI> and <HI>taxes</HI> of every kind, they were moreover and be&s;ides no le&s;s noted for mo&s;t other acts of beneficence according to their &s;tations in civil &s;ociety; being ever among the fir&s;t, <HI>in works and in&s;titutions of charity,</HI> where they lived, according to their abilities: &s;o that in contributions of this nature, they were ob&s;erved mo&s;tly either to be among the introducers or pro|moters of them, or otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed for their liberal donations; and if any were in di&s;tre&s;s, they were generally known to be among the fir&s;t to re|lieve them.</P>

<P>"And if he, or &s;he, &s;hall clear the <HI>profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> by &s;incere acknowledgment of their fault, and godly &s;orrow for &s;o doing, they are <HI>received,</HI> and <HI>looked upon again as members of their communion.</HI> For, as <HI>God,</HI> &s;o his true people <HI>upbraid no man</HI> after repentance."</P>

one of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1668. W.

In this he expo&s;ed the vulgar notion of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and &s;ome other religious tenets; which gave &s;o much offence to tho&s;e then at the helm of the church, that they immediately took the old method of reforming what they called er|ror, by their &s;tronge&s;t argument, <HI>viz. "An order for impri&s;oning him in the tower of London;"</HI>&mdash;there he was under clo&s;e confinement, and even denied the vi&s;its of his friends:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His impri|&s;onment in the tower of London.</NOTE> but yet his enemies attained not their purpo&s;e; for when, after &s;ome time, his &s;ervant brought him word, that the bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> was re&s;olved he &s;hould either publicly re|cant, or die a pri&s;oner, he made this reply: "All is well: I wi&s;h they had told me &s;o before; &s;ince the expecting a relea&s;e put a &s;top to &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s: thou may&s;t tell my father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His re&s;olu|tion.</NOTE> who, I know, will a&s;k thee the&s;e words; that my pri&s;on &s;hall be my grave, before I will budge a jot; for I owe my con&s;cience to no mortal man. I have no need to fear; God will make amends for all.

Neither great nor good things were ever attained without lo&s;s and hard|&s;hips.

<P>In the latter part of the &s;ummer this year, he went again to <HI>Ireland.</HI> Being arrived at <HI>Cork,</HI> he there vi&s;ited his friends the <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He goes to Ireland.</NOTE> who were in pri&s;on, for their religion, attended the meetings of his &s;ociety, and afterwards went from thence to <HI>Dublin;</HI> where an account of his friends &s;ufferings

<P>During his &s;tay in <HI>Ireland,</HI> though his bu&s;ine&s;s, in the care of his father's e&s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His bu&s;i|ne&s;s there.</NOTE> took up a con&s;i|derable part of his time, yet he frequently attend|ed, and preached in the meetings of his friends, e&s;pecially at <HI>Dublin</HI> and <HI>Cork;</HI> in one of which places he u&s;ually re&s;ided. He al&s;o wrote, during his re&s;idence there, &s;everal treati&s;es, and took every opportunity in his power, to &s;ollicit tho&s;e in autho|rity, in behalf of his friends in pri&s;on: and, in the beginning of the fourth month, 1670, through his repeated applications to the chancellor, the lord <HI>Arran,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> and the lord lieutenant, an order of coun|cil was obtained for their relea&s;e. Having &s;ettled his father's concerns to &s;atisfaction, and done his friends, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> many &s;ignal &s;ervices, he &s;hortly after returned to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1670 was pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>conventicle act,</HI> which prohibited the meetings of the di&s;&s;enters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> under &s;evere penalties. The rigour of this law was immediately executed upon the <HI>Quakers;</HI> who not being u&s;ed to give way, in the cau&s;e of religi|on, &s;tood mo&s;t expo&s;ed. They being kept out of their meeting hou&s;e, in <HI>Grace-church</HI> &s;treet in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> by force, met in the &s;treet it&s;elf, as near it as they could: <HI>W.

<P>Not long after this famous trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His father's reconcilia|tion and death.</NOTE> and his di&s;|charge from <HI>Newgate,</HI> his father died, entirely re|conciled to his &s;on; to whom, as before ob&s;erved, he left both his paternal ble&s;&s;ing, and a plentiful e&s;tate.

<P>He was about this time employed in defence of his religious principles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670. He di&s;putes with J.

<P>In the winter, this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He publi&s;h|es a book again&s;t Po|pery, &amp;c.</NOTE> having his re&s;idence at <HI>Penn,</HI> in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> he publi&s;hed a book, entitled, <HI>"A rea&s;onable caveat again&s;t Popery;"</HI> wherein he both expo&s;es and confutes many erro|neous doctrines of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and e&s;ta|bli&s;hes the oppo&s;ite truths, by &s;ound arguments; a work alone &s;ufficient, on the one hand, to wipe off the calumny, ca&s;t upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> of being a favourer of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> religion; and, on the other, to &s;hew, that his principle being for an univer&s;al liberty of con&s;cience, he would have had it extended, even to the Papi&s;ts them&s;elves, under a &s;ecurity of their not per&s;ecuting others.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t month of this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is taken and carried to the tow|er, &amp;c.</NOTE> while he was preaching in a religious meeting of his friends, in <HI>Wheeler-&s;treet, London,</HI> he was forceably &s;eized by a party of &s;oldiers, &s;ent thither for that purpo&s;e,

In his examination, on the occa&s;ion, before the lieutenant of the tower, Sir <HI>John Robin|&s;on, Starling,</HI> the lord mayor, and others, his be|haviour was very remarkable, &s;pirited and extraor|dinarily adapted to the nature of the occa&s;ion. It may be &s;een in the printed account of his life, prefixed to his literary works; in which, as the lieutenant's words and conduct appear high, imperious, and towards him manife&s;tly inimical, &s;o his replies were &s;mart, &s;en&s;ible and bold: and, on the lieutenant's charging him with his having been as bad as other people, and that both at home and abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remarka|ble an&s;wer.</NOTE> he received this remarkable an&s;wer from <HI>W.

e&s;pecially when our very &s;afety is eminently con|cerned in &s;o doing, and that we cannot decline this di&s;crimination of our&s;elves from <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> without being con&s;cious to our&s;elves of the guilt of our own &s;ufferings; for that mu&s;t every man needs be, that &s;uffers mutely, under another character than that, which truly and properly belongeth to him, and his belief. That which giveth me a more than ordinary right to &s;peak, at this time, and in this place, is the great abu&s;e, that I have received, above any other of my profe&s;&s;ion; for, of a long time, I have not only been &s;uppo&s;ed a Papi&s;t, but a <HI>&s;eminary,</HI> a <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> an <HI>emi&s;&s;ary</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and in pay from the <HI>Pope,</HI> a man dedicating my endea|vours to the intere&s;t and advancement of that party. Nor hath this been the report of the rabble, but the jealou&s;y and in&s;inuation of per&s;ons otherwi&s;e &s;ober and di&s;creet: Nay, &s;ome zealous for the Prote&s;tant religion, have been &s;o far gone in this mi&s;take, as not only to think ill of us, and to de|cline our conver&s;ation, but to take courage to them|&s;elves, to pro&s;ecute us for a &s;ort of concealed Pa|pi&s;ts; and the truth is, what with one thing, and what with another, we have been as the <HI>wool-&s;acks,</HI> and common <HI>whipping-&s;tock</HI> of the kingdom; all laws have been let loo&s;e upon us, as if the de&s;ign were not to reform, but to de&s;troy us, and that not for what <HI>we are,</HI> but for what <HI>we are not:</HI> It is hard, that we mu&s;t thus bear the &s;tripes of another intere&s;t, and be their proxy, in puni&s;hment; but it is wor&s;e, that &s;ome men can plea&s;e them&s;elves in &s;uch a &s;ort of admini&s;tration."</P>
<P>"I would not be mi&s;taken, I am far from think|ing it fit that <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> &s;hould be whipped for their con&s;ciences, becau&s;e I exclaim again&s;t the inju&s;tice of whipping <HI>Quakers</HI> for <HI>Papi&s;ts:</HI> No, for though the hand, pretended to be lifted up again&s;t them, hath (I know not by what direction) lit heavy upon us, and we complain; yet we do not mean, that

any &s;hould take a fre&s;h aim at them, or that they mu&s;t come in our room; for we mu&s;t give the liberty we a&s;k, and cannot be fal&s;e to our princi|ples, though it were to relieve our&s;elves; for we have <HI>good will</HI> to all men, and would have none &s;uffer for a truly &s;ober and con&s;cientious di&s;&s;ent, on any hand: and I humbly take leave to add, that tho&s;e methods, again&s;t per&s;ons &s;o qualified, do not &s;eem to me to be convincing, or indeed adequate to the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of mankind; but this I &s;ubmit to your con&s;ideration."</P>
<P>"To conclude, I hope we &s;hall be held excu&s;ed of the men of that profe&s;&s;ion, in giving this di&s;|tingui&s;hing declaration, &s;ince it is not with de&s;ign to expo&s;e them; but, fir&s;t, to pay that regard, we owe to the enquiry of this <HI>committee;</HI> and, in the next place, to relieve our&s;elves from the daily &s;poil and ruin, which now attend and threaten many hundreds of families, by the execution of <HI>laws,</HI> that we humbly conceive were never made again&s;t us."</P>

<P>In the pure love and precious fellow&s;hip of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t we very dearly &s;alute you;&mdash;Fora&s;much as there was a paper printed &s;e|veral months ago, entitled, <HI>"The de&s;cription of New-We&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> in which our names were mentioned, as Tru&s;tees for one undivided moiety of the &s;aid province, and becau&s;e it is alledged, that &s;ome, partly on this ac|count, and others apprehending that the paper, by the manner of its expre&s;&s;ion, came from the body of Friends, as a religious &s;ociety of people, and not from particulars, have, through the&s;e mi&s;takes, weakly concluded, that the &s;aid de&s;cription, in matter and form, might be writ, printed and recommended on purpo&s;e to prompt and allure people to di&s;-&s;ettle and tran&s;plant them&s;elves, as its al&s;o by &s;ome alledged; and becau&s;e we are informed that &s;everal have, on that account, taken encouragement and re&s;olution to tran&s;plant them&s;elves and families to that province; and left any of them (as is feared by &s;ome) &s;hould go out of a curious and un&s;ettled mind; and others to &s;hun the te&s;timony of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> of which &s;everal weighty friends have a godly jealou&s;y upon their &s;pirits, left an unwarrantable forwardne&s;s &s;hould act or hurry, any be|&s;ide, or beyond, the wi&s;dom and coun&s;el of the Lord, or the freedom of his light and &s;pirit, in their own hearts, and not upon good and weighty grounds; it truly laid upon us to let Friends know how the matter &s;tands; which we &s;hall endeavour to do with all clearne&s;s and fidelity.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is &s;uch a place as <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> is certain.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is reputed of tho&s;e, who have lived and travelled in that country to be whole&s;ome of air, and fruitful of &s;oil, and capable of &s;ea trade, is al&s;o certain; and it is not right, in any, to de&s;pi&s;e it, or di&s;&s;wade tho&s;e, that find freedom from the <HI>Lord,</HI> and nece&s;&s;ity put upon them, on going.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Duke of <HI>York</HI> &s;old it to tho&s;e called Lord <HI>Berkeley,</HI> Ba|ron of <HI>Stratton,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Carteret;</HI> equally to be divided between them, is al&s;o certain.</P>
<P N="4">4. One moiety, or half part, of the &s;aid province, being the right of the Lord <HI>Berkeley,</HI> was &s;old by him to <HI>John Fenwicke,</HI> in tru&s;t for <HI>Edward Byllinge,</HI> and his a&s;&s;igns.</P>
<P N="5">5. Fora&s;much as <HI>Edward Billinge</HI> (after <HI>William Penn</HI> had ended the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">erence between <HI>E. Byllinge</HI> and <HI>J. Fenwicke</HI>) was willing to pre&s;ent his intere&s;t, in the &s;aid province, to his creditors, as all that he had left him, towards their &s;atisfaction, he de&s;ired <HI>W. Penn</HI> (though every way unconcerned) and <HI>Gawen Lawrie</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Lucas,</HI> two of his credi|tors, to be tru&s;tees, for performance of the &s;ame; and becau&s;e &s;everal of his creditors, particularly and very importunately pre&s;&s;ed <HI>W. Penn</HI> to accept of the tru&s;t, for their &s;akes and &s;ecurity, we did, all of us, comply with the&s;e, and the like reque&s;ts, and accepted of the tru&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. Upon this we became tru&s;tees for one moiety of the &s;aid province, yet undivided; and after do little labour, trouble and co&s;t, a divi&s;ion was obtained between the &s;aid Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> and us, as tru&s;tees: the country is &s;ituated and bounded, as is expre&s;&s;ed in the printed de&s;cription.</P>
<P N="7">7. This now divided moiety is to be ca&s;t into one hundred parts, lots or proprieties; ten of which, upon the agreement, made betwixt <HI>E. Billinge</HI> and <HI>J. Fenwicke,</HI> his executors and a&s;&s;igns, with a con&s;ider|able &s;um of money by way of &s;atisfaction, for what he became concerned in the purcha&s;e from the &s;aid Lord <HI>Berkeley,</HI> and by him afterwards con|veyed to <HI>John Edridge</HI> and <HI>Edmond Warner,</HI> their heirs and a&s;&s;igns.</P>
<P N="8">8. The ninety parts remaining are expo&s;ed to &s;ale; on behalf of the creditors of the &s;aid <HI>Edward Byllinge.</HI> And forasmuch &s;everal friends are concerned as creditors, as well as others, and the di&s;po&s;al of &s;o great a part of this country being in our hands; we did in real tenderne&s;s and regard to friends, and e&s;pecially to the poor and nece&s;&s;itous, make friends the fir&s;t offer; that if any of them, though particularly tho&s;e, who being low in the world, and under trials about a comfortable livelihood for them&s;elves and families, &s;hould be de&s;irous of dealing for any part or parcel thereof, that they might have the refu&s;al.</P>
<P N="9">9. This was the real and hone&s;t intent of our hearts, and not to prompt, or allure any out of their places, either by the credit our names might have with our people throughout the nation, or by repre&s;enting the thing otherwi&s;e than it is in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to the printed paper, &s;ome time &s;ince &s;et forth by the creditors, as a de&s;cription of that province, we &s;ay, as to two pa&s;&s;ages in it, they are not &s;o clearly and &s;afely worded as ought to have been; particularly in &s;eeming to hint, the <HI>Winter</HI> &s;ea&s;on to be &s;o &s;hort a time; when, on fur|ther information, we hear it is &s;ometimes longer, and &s;ometimes &s;horter, than therein expre&s;&s;ed; and the la&s;t clau&s;e, relating to liberty of con&s;cience, we would not have any to think, that it is promi&s;ed or intended, to main|tain the liberty of the exerci&s;e of religion by force of arms; though we &s;hall never con&s;ent to any the lea&s;t violence on con&s;cience; yet it was never de&s;igned to encourage any to expect by force of arms, to have liberty of con&s;cience fenced again&s;t invaders thereof.</P>
<P>And be it known unto you all, in the name and fear of Almighty God, his Glory and Honor, Power and Wi&s;dom, Truth and Kingdom, is dearer to us, than all vi&s;ible things; and as our eye has been &s;ingle, and our hearts &s;incere, in the living God, in this, as in other things, &s;o we de&s;ire all, whom it may concern, that all groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies may be judged down, and watched again&s;t; and that all extremes may be avoided, on all hands, by the power of the Lord; that nothing which hurts or grieves the holy life of truth in any that goes or &s;tays, may be adhered to, nor any provocation given to break precious unity.</P>
<P>This am I, <HI>William Penn,</HI> moved of the Lord to write unto you, left any bring a temptation upon them&s;elves, or others; and, in offend|ing the Lord, &s;lay their own Peace. Ble&s;&s;ed are they that can &s;ee and behold him their Leader, their Orderer, their Conductor and Pre&s;erver in &s;taying and going; who&s;e is the earth and the fulne&s;s thereof, and the cattle upon a thou&s;and hills. And, as we formerly writ, we cannot but repeat our reque&s;t unto you, that, in whom&s;oever a de&s;ire is to be con|cerned in this intended plantation, &s;uch would weigh the thing before the Lord, and not headily, or ra&s;hly, conclude on any &s;uch remove; and that they do not offer violence to the tender love of their near kindred and relations, but &s;oberly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly endeavour to obtain their <HI>good wills;</HI> the unity of friends, where they live; that, whether they go, or &s;tay, it may be of good favour before the Lord, and good people; from whom only can all heavenly and earthly ble&s;&s;ings come;&mdash;This we thought good to write, for the preventing all mi&s;under&s;tandings, and to declare the real truth of the matter; and &s;o we recommend you all to the Lord, who is the watchman of his I&s;rael.

<P>Extract from John Crips's letter, dated, <HI>Burlington,</HI> on <HI>Delaware,</HI> 26th. 8th. month, 1677, to his friend Henry Stacy, in England.</P>
<P>"Here is a town (Burlington) laid out for twenty proprieties, and a &s;traight line, drawn from the river &s;ide (Delaware) up the land, which is to be the main &s;treet, and a market place about the middle. The <HI>York|&s;hire</HI> ten proprietors are to build on one &s;ide, and the <HI>London</HI> ten, on the other &s;ide; and they have ordered one &s;treet to be made along the river &s;ide; which is not divided with the re&s;t, but in &s;mall lots by it&s;elf, and every one that hath any part in a propriety, is to have his &s;hare in it. The town lots for every propriety will be about ten or eleven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which is only for a hou&s;e, orchard and gardens, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"The <HI>Indians</HI> told us, in a conference at <HI>Burlington,</HI> &s;hortly after we came into the country, they were advi&s;ed to make war on us, and cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> off, while we were but few; for that we &s;old them the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> with the Match coat they had bought of us:&mdash;Which cau&s;ed our peo|ple to be in fears and jealou&s;ies concerning them: therefore we &s;ent for the <HI>Indian Kings,</HI> to &s;peak with them, who with many more <HI>Indians,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to <HI>Burlington,</HI> where we had a conference with them, about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tter.

<P>"Our young men may &s;peak &s;uch words as we do not like, nor ap|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e of; and we cannot help it.

I have travelled through mo&s;t of the places that are &s;ettled, and &s;ome that are not; and in every place I find the country very apt to an&s;wer the expectation of the diligent. I have &s;een orchards laden with fruit to admiration, their very limbs torn to pieces with the weight, and mo&s;t delicious to the ta&s;te, and lovely to behold. I have &s;een an apple-tree, from a pippin-kernel, yield a barrel of curious cyder; and peaches in &s;uch plenty, that &s;ome people took their carts a peach-gathering; I could not but &s;mile at the conceit of it; they are very delicate fruit, and hang almo&s;t like our oni|ons, that are tied on ropes. I have &s;een and known, this &s;ummer, forty bu&s;hels of bold wheat of one bu&s;hel &s;own; and many more &s;uch in&s;tances I could bring, which would be too tedious here to mention. We have, from the time called May until Michaelmas, great &s;tore of very good wild fruits; as, &s;trawberries, cranberries and hurtle-berries, which are like our bilberries in <HI>England,</HI> but far &s;weeter; they are very whole&s;ome fruits. The cranberries, much like cherries, for color and bigne&s;s; which may be kept till fruit come again; an excellent &s;auce is made of them for ve|ni&s;on, turkeys, and other great fowl; and they are better to make tarts than either goo&s;berries or cherries; we have them brought to our hou&s;es by the <HI>Indians,</HI> in great plenty. My brother Robert had as many cherries, this year, as would have loaded &s;everal carts. It is my judgment, by what I have ob&s;erved, that fruit trees, in this country, de&s;troy them&s;elves by the very weight of their fruit.</P>
<P>As for veni&s;on and fowls, we have great plenty; we have brought home to our hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plenty in New-Jer|&s;ey, in 1680.</NOTE> by the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;even or eight fat bucks in a day; and &s;ometimes put by as many, having no occa&s;ion for them, and fi&s;h, in their &s;ea&s;on very plenteous. my cou&s;in <HI>Revell</HI> and I, with &s;ome of my men, went la&s;t third month into the river to catch her|rings;
<PB N="154" REF="032729_0154_0FF4EF825A9F2B98">
for, at that time, they came in great &s;holes into the &s;hallows; we had neither rod nor net; but, after the <HI>Indian</HI> fa&s;hion, made a round pin|fold, about two yards over, and a foot high, but left a gap for the fi&s;h to go in at, and made a bu&s;h to lay in the gap, to keep the fi&s;h in; and when that was done, we took two long birches, and tied their tops together, and went about a &s;tones-ca&s;t above our &s;aid pinfold; then hawling the&s;e birch boughs down the &s;tream, where we drove thou&s;ands before us; but &s;o many got into our trap as it would hold; and then we began to hawl them on &s;hore, as fa&s;t as three or four of us could, by two or three at a time; and, after this manner, in half an hour, we could have filled a three bu&s;hel &s;ack of as good large herrings as ever I &s;aw. And as to beef and pork, here is great plenty of it, and cheap; and al&s;o good &s;heep. The common gra&s;s of this country feeds beef very fat. I have killed two this year; and there|fore I have rea&s;on to know it: be&s;ides, I have &s;een, this fall, in <HI>Burlington,</HI> killed eight or nine fat oxen and cows on a market day, and all very fat. And though I &s;peak of herrings only, left any &s;hould think we have little other &s;orts, we have great plenty of mo&s;t &s;orts of fi&s;h, that ever I &s;aw in <HI>England:</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal other &s;orts that are not known there; as, rocks, cat-fi&s;h, &s;hads, &s;heeps-heads, &s;turgeons; and fowls plenty; as, ducks, gee&s;e, tur|keys, phea&s;ants, partridges; and many other &s;orts, that I cannot remember, and would be too tedi|ous to mention.</P>

their religious and civil capacity; in&s;omuch that his name is revered in a double re&s;pect, and ren|dered dear to po&s;terity. The fruits of his labours have placed his conduct above the power of envy and detraction; which would pervert every good and laudable de&s;ign to the vile&s;t purpo&s;es, and repre&s;ent the mo&s;t generous actions, as ari&s;ing from &s;ordid and &s;ini&s;ter views: evils, which always indicate their oppo&s;ite virtues and true merit, and have their re&s;idence in ba&s;e and low minds.</P>

<P>This was fir&s;t laid before the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> and afterwards, the Lords of the committee of trade and plantations.

<P>In the preface to this <HI>frame</HI> is exhibited a &s;ketch of the author's &s;entiments on the nature of go|vernment, in general, his reflections on the diffe|rent modes of it, and his inducement for forming his. It may &s;erve to give &s;ome idea of the judg|ment of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in general, on this &s;ubject,
<PB N="197" REF="032729_0197_0FF4F0ADA02AD148">
re&s;pecting which they have frequently been mi&s;re|pre&s;ented; I &s;hall, therefore, here give the follow|ing extract from it.&mdash;The author, after having quoted &s;everal parts of the &s;acred &s;criptures, rela|tive to government, proceeds, in the following words:</P>
<P>&mdash;"This &s;ettles the divine right of government beyond exception,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of the preface to his frame of Govern|ment.</NOTE> and that for two ends; fir&s;t, to terrify evil doers; &s;econdly, to cheri&s;h tho&s;e, that do well; which gives government a life be|yond corruption; and makes it as durable, in the world, as good men &s;hall be. So that go|vernment &s;eems to me a part of religion it&s;elf; a thing &s;acred, in its in&s;titution and end. For, if it does not directly remove the cau&s;e, it cru&s;hes the effects of evil; and is, as &s;uch, a lower, yet an <HI>emanation of the &s;ame divine power,</HI> that is both author and object of pure religion; the dif|ference lying here; that the one is more free and mental, the other more corporal and compul&s;ive, in its operation: but that is only to evil-doers; govern|ment it&s;elf being otherwi&s;e as capable of kindne&s;s, goodne&s;s and charity, as a more private &s;ociety.</P>
<P>"They weakly err, that think there is no other u&s;e of government, than <HI>correction;</HI> which is the coar&s;e&s;t part of it: daily experience tells us, that the care and regulation of many other affairs, more &s;oft, and daily nece&s;&s;ary, make up much the greater part of government; and which mu&s;t have followed the peopling of the world, had <HI>Adam</HI> never fallen; and will continue among men, on earth, under the highe&s;t attainments, they may arrive at, by the coming of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> from Heaven."&mdash;</P>
<P>As to the modes, he further ob&s;erves,&mdash;"I do not find a model in the world, that time, place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of modes of Govern|ment in ge|neral.</NOTE> and &s;ome &s;ingular emergencies, have not nece&s;&s;a|rily altered; nor is it ea&s;y to frame a civil govern|ment, that &s;hall &s;erve all places alike;".&mdash;"Any
<PB N="198" REF="032729_0198_0FF4F04359E07F18">
government is free to the people under it (what|ever be the frame) where the laws rule, and the people are a party to tho&s;e laws; and more than this is tyranny, olygarchy, or confu&s;ion."&mdash;</P>
<P>"There is hardly one <HI>frame</HI> of government, in the world, &s;o ill de&s;igned by its fir&s;t founders, that, in good hands, would not do well enough; and hi&s;tory tells us, the be&s;t, in ill ones, can do nothing, that is great and good; Witne&s;s, the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tates. Governments, like clocks, go from the motion, men give them; and as governments are made and moved by men, &s;o by them are they ruined too. Wherefore, go|vernments rather depend upon men, than men upon governments. Let men be good, and the government cannot be bad; if it be ill, they will cure it. But, if men be bad, let government be never &s;o good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of the preface to William Penn's frame Govern|ment.</NOTE> they will endeavour to warp and &s;poil it to their turn."&mdash;"That, therefore, which makes a good government, mu&s;t keep it, <HI>viz.</HI> Men of wi&s;dom and virtue; qualities, that, be|cau&s;e they de&s;cend not with worldy inheritances, mu&s;t be carefully propagated by a <HI>virtuous educa|tion of youth;</HI> for which after ages will owe more to the care and prudence of <HI>founders,</HI> and the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive <HI>Magi&s;tracy,</HI> than to their parents, for their private patrimonies."</P>
<P>"The&s;e con&s;iderations," (&s;everal of which, for brevity, are here omitted) of the weight of go|vernment, and the nice and various opinions about it, made it unea&s;y to me to think of publi&s;hing the en&s;uing <HI>frame,</HI> and <HI>conditional laws,</HI> fore&s;eeing both the cen&s;ures, they will meet with, from men of differing humours and engagements, and the occa&s;ion they may give of di&s;cour&s;e beyond my de&s;ign."</P>
<P>"But, next to the power of nece&s;&s;ity (which is a &s;ollicitor, that will take no denial) this induced me to a compliance, that we have, (with reve|rence
<PB N="199" REF="032729_0199_0FF4F0BA6107A0A0">
to <HI>God,</HI> and good con&s;cience to <HI>men</HI>) to the be&s;t of our &s;kill, contrived and compo&s;ed the <HI>frame</HI> and <HI>laws</HI> of this government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;on for publi&s;hing his frame and laws.</NOTE> to the great end of government, <HI>viz. To &s;upport power in reve|rence with the people, and to &s;ecure the people from the abu&s;e of power;</HI> that they may be free by their ju&s;t obedience, and the Magi&s;trates honourable, for their ju&s;t admini&s;tration; for liberty without obedience is confu&s;ion; and obedience without li|berty is &s;lavery. To carry this evenne&s;s, is partly owing to the con&s;titution, and partly to the Ma|gi&s;tracy: where either of the&s;e fail, government will be &s;ubject to convul&s;ions; but where both are wanting, it mu&s;t be totally &s;ubverted: then, where both meet, the government is like to endure; which I humbly pray, and hope, <HI>God</HI> will plea&s;e to make the lot of this of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> Amen."</P>
<P>The <HI>frame</HI> it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-four arti|cles; and the laws were forty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purport of the frame of govern|ment.</NOTE> By the former the government was placed in the Governor and Freemen of the province, in the form of a pro|vincial council, and General A&s;&s;embly. By them conjunctively all laws were to be made, all officers appointed, and all public affairs tran&s;acted. Se|venty-two was the number of the Council, to be cho&s;en by the freemen; and though the Governor, or his deputy, was to be perpetual Pre&s;ident, he had but a treble vote. One-third part of them was, at fir&s;t, to be cho&s;en for three years, one-third for two years, and one-third for one year; in &s;uch manner, that there might be an annual &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of twenty-four new members, each to conti|nue three years, and no longer.&mdash;The General A&s;|&s;embly was, the fir&s;t year, to con&s;i&s;t of all the free|men, afterwards of two hundred, and never to ex|ceed five hundred. And this charter, or form of government, was not to be altered, changed, or dimini&s;hed, in any part, or clau&s;e of it, without the con&s;ent of the Governor, his heirs, or a&s;&s;igns,
<PB N="200" REF="032729_0200_0FF4F04F7651E628">
and &s;ix parts of &s;even of the freemen, in Provin|cial Council and A&s;&s;embly. And to the &s;ame power only was the alteration of the laws made &s;ubject: the&s;e laws were of the nature of an ori|ginal compact between the proprietary and the freemen; and, as &s;uch, were reciprocally received and executed: one of them was,</P>
<P>"That all per&s;ons living in this province, who confe&s;s and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal <HI>God</HI> to be the Creator,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One of the fir&s;t laws.</NOTE> Upholder and Ru|ler of the world, and that hold them&s;elves obliged, in con&s;cience, to live peaceably and ju&s;tly in civil &s;ociety, &s;hall, in no ways, be mole&s;ted, or preju|diced, for their religious per&s;wa&s;ion, or practice, in matters of faith and wor&s;hip; nor &s;hall they be compelled, at any time, to frequent, or maintain, any religious wor&s;hip, place, or mini&s;try what|ever."</P>

(About the year <HI>1727.</HI>)</HEAD>
<P>Whereas King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, in the year 1681, was plea&s;ed to grant this province to <HI>William Penn,</HI> and his heirs, for ever; which act &s;eemed to be an act of <HI>Providence</HI> to many reli|gious, good, people; and the Proprietor, <HI>William Penn,</HI> being one of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and in good e&s;teem, among them and others, many were inclined to embark along with him, for the &s;ettlement of this place.</P>
<P>To that end, in the year 1682 &s;everal &s;hips being provided, I found a concern on my mind to embark with them, with my wife and child; and about the latter end of the Sixth-month, having &s;ettled my affairs in <HI>London,</HI> where I dwelt, I went, on board the &s;hip <HI>Welcome, Robert Greenaway,</HI> commander, in company with my worthy friend, <HI>William Penn;</HI> who&s;e good conver&s;ation was very advantageous to all the company. His &s;ingular care was manife&s;ted, in contributing to the nece&s;&s;i|ties of many, who were &s;ick of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> then on board; out of which company about thirty died.&mdash;After a pro&s;perous pa&s;&s;age of about two months, having had, in that time, many good meetings, on board, we arrived here.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="032729_0229_0FF4F16EFA0E1F20">At our arrival, we found it a wilderne&s;s; the chief inhabitants were <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Swedes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard Town&s;ends account, &amp;c.</NOTE> who received us in a friendly manner: and though there was a great number of us, the good hand of <HI>Providence</HI> was &s;een in a particular manner; in that provi&s;ions were found for us, by the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> at very rea&s;onable rates, as well as brought from divers other parts, that were inha|bited before.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t concern was to keep up and main|tain our <HI>religious wor&s;hip;</HI> and, in order thereunto, we had &s;everal <HI>meetings,</HI> in the hou&s;es of the inha|bitants; and one boarded meeting-hou&s;e was &s;et up, where the city was to be, near <HI>Delaware;</HI> and, as we had nothing but love and good-will, in our hearts, one to another, we had very comfortable meetings, from time to time; and after our meet|ing was over, we a&s;&s;i&s;ted each other, in building little hou&s;es, for our &s;helter.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time I &s;et up a <HI>mill,</HI> on <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> creek; which I brought ready framed from <HI>London;</HI> which &s;erved for grinding of corn, and &s;awing of boards; and was of great u&s;e to us. Be&s;ides, I with <HI>Jo&s;hua Tittery,</HI> made a net, and caught great quantities of fi&s;h; which &s;upplied our&s;elves and many others; &s;o that, notwith&s;tanding it was thought near three thou&s;and per&s;ons came in the fir&s;t year, we were &s;o providentially provided for, that we could buy a deer for about two &s;hillings, and a large turkey, for about one &s;hilling, and <HI>Indian</HI> corn for about two &s;hillings and &s;ix pence per bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>And, as our worthy Proprietor treated the <HI>Indians</HI> with extraordinary humanity, they became very civil and loving to us, and brought in abun|dance of veni&s;on. As, in other countries, the <HI>In|dians</HI> were exa&s;perated by hard treatment, which hath been the foundation of much blood&s;hed, &s;o the contrary treatment here hath produced their love and affection.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="032729_0230_0FF4F10438FF2BD8">About a year after our arrival, there came in about twenty families from high and low <HI>Germany,</HI> of religious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard Town&s;ends account, &amp;c.</NOTE> good people; who &s;ettled about &s;ix miles from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and called the place <HI>Ger|mantown.</HI>&mdash;The country continually increa&s;ing, people began to &s;pread them&s;elves further back.&mdash; "Al&s;o a place called <HI>North Wales,</HI> was &s;ettled by many of the <HI>ancient Britons,</HI> an hone&s;t inclined people, although they had not then made a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the truth, as held by us, yet, in a little time, a large convincement was among them; and divers meeting-hou&s;es were built.</P>
<P>About the time, in which <HI>Germantown</HI> was laid out, I &s;ettled upon my tract of land, which I had purcha&s;ed of the Proprietor, in <HI>England,</HI> about a mile from thence; where I &s;et up a hou&s;e and a corn mill;&mdash;which was very u&s;eful to the country, for &s;everal miles round:&mdash;But there not being plenty of hor&s;es, people generally brought their corn on their backs many miles;&mdash;I remember one man had a bull &s;o gentle, that he u&s;ed to bring his corn on him, in&s;tead of a hor&s;e.</P>

<P>As people began to &s;pread, and improve their lands, the country became more fruitful; &s;o that tho&s;e, who came after us, were plentifully &s;upplied; and with what we abounded we began a &s;mall trade abroad.

Some kings have &s;old, others pre&s;ented me with &s;everal parcels of land: the pay, or pre&s;ents I made them, were not hoarded by the particular owners; but the neighbouring kings, and their clans being pre&s;ent, when the goods were brought out, the parties, chiefly concerned, con&s;ulted what, and to whom, they &s;hould give them.

<P>THOUGH it be a duty, I humbly own,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> to inform the Lords of the committee of plantations, of what concerns his maje&s;ty's intere&s;t in the &s;uc|ce&s;s of this province, I thought my&s;elf equally obliged to be di&s;creet and cautious in doing it. To write, then, there was need, and not to trou|ble per&s;ons, of their honor and bu&s;ine&s;s, with things trivial, at lea&s;t, raw and unfini&s;hed for their view. This hitherto put me by giving any account of the &s;tate of our affairs, to &s;ay nothing of the mighty difficulties, I have laboured under, in the &s;ettlement of &s;ix-and-twenty &s;ail of people, to con|tent, within the &s;pace of one year; which makes my ca&s;e &s;ingular, and excu&s;able, above any other of the King's plantations.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e my agent has informed me that the Proprietor of <HI>Maryland</HI> has been early in his account of our conference about fixing our bounds, and made a narrative of my affairs, as well before, as at that time, a little to my di&s;advantage, and the rather, becau&s;e my &s;ilence might be interpreted neglect, I am nece&s;&s;itated to make &s;ome defence for my&s;elf; which, as it will not he hard to make, &s;o I hope it will be received as ju&s;t.</P>
<P>I humbly &s;ay, then, fir&s;t, that it &s;eemed to me improper to trouble the Lords with my tran|&s;actions with this Proprietor, till we were come to &s;ome re&s;ult; which we were not: for we parted till &s;pring; and even then were but to meet about the methods of our proceedings.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="032729_0268_0FF4F1B0308061C0">Next, This narrative was taken by the Lord's orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> without my con&s;ent, or knowledge, in a corner of a room by one of his own attendants.</P>
<P>And, la&s;tly, upon when notice was given of this u&s;age, I complained to him, he promi&s;ed, upon his word and honor, it &s;hould go not far|ther; and that it was for his own &s;atisfaction he did it; I told him that mitigated the thing a little; but if he &s;hould divulge it before I &s;aw and agreed to the copy, he mu&s;t pardon me, if I looked upon it as a mo&s;t unfair practice.&mdash;What that Lord has done, and what to call it, I leave to my betters; but the &s;urprize and indige&s;tion of the whole will, I hope excu&s;e me of neglect, or di&s;re&s;pect: for though I am unceremonious, I would, by no means, act the rude, or undutiful.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, I humbly beg that I may give a brief narrative of the matter, as it then pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince has been, and now &s;tands, without the weak|ne&s;s and tautology his relation makes me guilty of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of W.

At my return, which was towards the end of November, I found the me&s;&s;engers, whom I had &s;ent to <HI>Maryland,</HI> newly arrived, and the time fixed, being the 19th. of December. I prepared my&s;elf in a few days for that province. The 11th. of the month I came to we&s;t river; where I met the Proprietor, atten|ded &s;uitable to his character; who took the occa|&s;ion, by his civilities, to &s;hew me the greatne&s;s of his power: The next day we had conference about our bu&s;ine&s;s of the bounds, both at the &s;ame table, with our re&s;pective members of council.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="032729_0269_0FF4F20B6CBB9190">The fir&s;t thing I did was to pre&s;ent the King's letter; which con&s;i&s;ted of two parts:&mdash;One, that the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had but two degrees; and the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W.

This being read by him, fir&s;t privately, then publicly, he told me, the King was greatly mi&s;ta|ken, and that he would not leave his patent, to follow the King's letter, nor could a letter void his patent; and by that he would &s;tand.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of what he &s;aid from fir&s;t to la&s;t, during the whole conference. To this I an&s;wered, the King might be mi&s;informed rather than mi&s;taken, and that I was afraid the mi&s;take would fall on his &s;ide; for though his pa|tent begins at <HI>Watkins's</HI> point and goes to the forti|eth degree of north latitude, yet it pre&s;umed that to lye in the 38th. el&s;e <HI>Virginia</HI> would be wronged, which &s;hould extend to that degree; however this I a&s;&s;ured him, that when I petitioned the King for five degrees north latitude and that petition was referred to the Lords of the committee of planta|tions; at that time, it was urged by &s;ome pre&s;ent, that the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had but two degrees; upon which the Lord Pre&s;ident, turning his head to me, at who&s;e chair I &s;tood, &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Penn, will not three degrees &s;erve your turn?</HI> I an&s;wered, <HI>"I &s;ubmit both the what, and how, to the honour|able board."</HI></P>
<P>To this his uncle, and chancellor, returned, that to convince me his father's grant was not by degrees, he had more of <HI>Virginia</HI> given him, but being planted, and the grant intending only land not planted, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but of &s;avage na|tives, he left it out, that it might not forfeit the re&s;t: Of which the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> takes no notice, in his narrative, that I remember.&mdash;But, by that an&s;wer, he can pretend nothing to <HI>Delaware;</HI> which was at, and before, the pa&s;&s;ing of that pa|tent,
<PB N="270" REF="032729_0270_0FF4F1B1CA618FF0">
bought and planted by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and &s;o could not be given:&mdash;But, if it were, it was for|feited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> for not reducing it, during twenty years, under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;overeignty; of which he held it; but was at la&s;t reduced by the King, and there|fore his, to give as he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>Perceiving that my pre&s;&s;ing the King's letter was unea&s;y, and that I had determined my&s;elf to di&s;po&s;e him with utmo&s;t &s;oftne&s;s to a good compli|ance, I waved that of the two degrees, and pre&s;&s;ed the admea&s;urement only, the next part of the let|ter:&mdash;For though it were two degrees, and a half from <HI>Watkins's</HI> point to forty degrees, yet let it be mea&s;ured at &s;ixty miles to a degree, and I would begin at forty degrees, fall as it would:&mdash;My de|&s;ign was, that every degree being &s;eventy miles, I &s;hould get all that was over &s;ixty, the proportion intended the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> by the grant, and computation of a degree, at that time of the day:&mdash;Thus he had enjoyed the full favour intend|ed him, and I had gained a door of great impor|tance to the peopling and improving of his maje&s;ty's province.</P>
<P>But he this al&s;o rejected;&mdash;I told him, it was not the love, or need, of the land, but the water; that he abounded in what I wanted, and acce&s;s and harbouring, even, to exce&s;s; that I would not be thus importunate, but for the importance of the thing, to &s;ave a province; and becau&s;e there was no proportion in the concern; if I were an hundred times more urgent and tenacious, the ca&s;e would excu&s;e it; becau&s;e the thing in&s;i&s;ted on was more than ninety-nine times more valuable to me than to him; to me the head, to him, the tail.&mdash;I added, that, if it were his, and he gave it me, planting it would recompence the favours, not only by laying his country between two thriving provinces, but the &s;hips, that come yearly to <HI>Ma|ryland</HI> for <HI>tobacco,</HI> would have the bringing of

<P>When the &s;pring came I &s;ent an expre&s;s to pray the time and place, when and where I &s;hould meet him, to effect the bu&s;ine&s;s, we adjourned to, at that time. I followed clo&s;e upon the me&s;&s;enger, that no time might be lo&s;t. But the expectation, he twice had, of the Lord <HI>Culpepper's</HI> vi&s;it, di&s;ap|pointed any meeting on our affairs, till the month called May; he then &s;ent three gentlemen to let me know, he would meet me at the head of the bay of <HI>Che&s;apeak;</HI> I was then in treaty with the kings of the natives for land; but three days after we met ten miles from <HI>New-ca&s;tle,</HI> which is thirty from the bay. I invited him to the town, where having entertained him, as well as the town could afford, on &s;o little notice, and finding him only de&s;irous of &s;peaking with me privately, I pre&s;&s;ed that we might, at our di&s;tinct lodgings, &s;it &s;eve|rally with our councils, and treat by way of writ|ten memorials; which would prevent the mi&s;takes, or abu&s;es, that may follow from ill de&s;igns, or ill memory; but he avoided it, &s;aying, "He was not well, and the weather &s;ultry, and would return with what &s;peed he could, re&s;erving any other treaty to another &s;ea&s;on."&mdash;Thus we parted, at that time. I had been before told by divers, that the &s;aid <HI>Baltimore</HI> had i&s;&s;ued forth a proclamation,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the note in page 265, &amp;c.</NOTE> to invite people, by lower prices, and greater quan|tities of land, to plant in the lower counties; in which the Duke's goodne&s;s had intere&s;ted me, as an in&s;eparable benefit to this whole province. I was not willing to believe it; and the being in ha&s;te, I omitted to a&s;k him: But I had not been
<PB N="272" REF="032729_0272_0FF4F1B359EC1BC0">
long returned before two letters came from two judges of two of the country courts, that &s;uch a proclamation was abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> that the people too hear|ken to it, but yet prayed my directions. I bade them keep their ground, and not fear, for the King would be judge. Upon this I di&s;patched to the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> three of my council, with the clerk of it: As they went they got an authentic copy, under the hand of one of his &s;heriffs, to whom an original had been directed: But, as the la&s;t civility, I would yield him, I forbad them to &s;eem to believe any thing, but what they had from his own mouth.&mdash;Thus they delivered my letter.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, he denied any &s;uch proclamation, turning to two gentlemen of his council, who &s;tood by, he a&s;ked them, if they remembered any &s;uch thing? They al&s;o denied it. Upon which the per&s;ons, I &s;ent, produced the atte&s;ted copy; which, refre&s;hing their memories, they confe&s;&s;ed there was &s;uch a proclamation.</P>
<P>But the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> told them, that it was his ancient form, and he only did it to renew his claim, not that he would encourage any to plant there. They then prayed him to call it in, le&s;t any trouble &s;hould en&s;ue: but he refu&s;ed it.&mdash;This was during a civil treaty, without any demand made, and after the place had been many years in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Duke.&mdash;What to call this I &s;till humbly refer to my &s;uperiors. For his preten&s;ions to tho&s;e parts I have thoroughly in&s;truct|ed my agent; who, I hope, will be able to detect them of weakne&s;s and incon&s;i&s;tency. This is a true, though brief, narrative of the entertainment, I have had from that Lord, in the bu&s;ine&s;s be|tween us.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e I have, as in duty joined, &s;ent an agent extraordinary, to wait upon the King, and his mini&s;ters, in the affairs of this province (&s;o &s;oon as I could make any &s;ettlement in it) I &s;hall only

humbly pray leave to hint at two or three things, relating to the bu&s;ine&s;s depending between this lord and my&s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> about finding the fortieth degree of north latitude.</P>
<P N="1">I. That I have common fame on my &s;ide, grounded upon ancient and con&s;tant judges, that the fortieth degree of north latitude lyeth about <HI>Boles's-i&s;le.</HI> This the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> him&s;elf, hath not denied; and the country confe&s;&s;eth; and I &s;hall, when required, prove by &s;ome able ma&s;ters of &s;hips.</P>
<P N="2">II. If this were an error, it is grounded upon &s;uch &s;kill and in&s;truments, as gave mea&s;ure to the time, in which his patent was granted:&mdash;and if he hath got upon <HI>Virginia</HI> by that error, he &s;hould not get upon me by an exacter knowledge, con&s;idering that <HI>Carolina,</HI> which endeth by degrees, would as much advance upon <HI>Virginia,</HI> if the reputed latitude of unprejudiced times &s;hould take no place;&mdash;for by advancing her bounds twenty miles, by a new in&s;trument, beyond the place; which hath been generally taken for thirty-&s;ix and an half degrees; and <HI>Virginia</HI> not being equally able to advance upon <HI>Maryland,</HI> becau&s;e of its being at a place certain, &s;he will be greatly narrowed between both.</P>
<P N="3">III. I, therefore, mo&s;t humbly pray, that the judgment of ancient times, by which per&s;ons at the di&s;tance of <HI>England</HI> from <HI>America,</HI> have governed them&s;elves, may conclude that the lord's bounds, or, that he may mea&s;ure his two degrees according to the &s;cale and computations of tho&s;e times, which was &s;ixty miles to a degree; or, if it be allowed, that he had not his grant by degrees, that, at la&s;t, I might not lo&s;e the benefit of admea&s;urement, as before mentioned, from <HI>Watkins's-point,</HI> in whatever degree of latitude that &s;hall be found, to the fortieth degree of north latitude, which I humbly take the more courage to pre&s;s, becau&s;e a province lyeth at &s;take, in the &s;ucce&s;s of it.</P>

<HEAD>An an&s;wer to a <HI>demand,</HI> made to <HI>Nicholas Moore,</HI> as my deputy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> by Colonel <HI>George Talbot,</HI> the <HI>24th.</HI> of September, <HI>1683,</HI> in pur&s;uance of a <HI>commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> from the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> Proprietary of <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Avalon,</HI> dated the <HI>17th.</HI> of the &s;ame month.</HEAD>
<P>The demand being grounded upon the <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> I will take things in their order, and begin with the commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> doth commi&s;&s;ionate Colo|nel <HI>Talbot</HI> to go to the we&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Skulkil</HI> to demand of <HI>William Penn,</HI> E&s;quire, or his deputy, all that part of land on the we&s;t &s;ide of that river, that lyeth to the &s;outh of the fortieth degree of northerly latitude.</P>
<P N="1">I. I an&s;wer, it &s;eems very &s;light, abrupt and unprecedented for any per&s;on, that is in the quality of a Proprietary of a country, to &s;end to another in the &s;ame circum&s;tance, any extraordinary me&s;|&s;enger, agent, or commi&s;&s;ioner, without &s;ome let|ter, or memorial, to &s;tate the <HI>demand,</HI> with the rea&s;ons of it; the practice of the greate&s;t princes, and might therefore (I conceive) be the conde&s;cen|&s;ion of le&s;&s;er &s;eigniories.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the next place, <HI>William Penn,</HI> E&s;quire, and the &s;aid <HI>Penn,</HI> (the language of the commi&s;&s;ion) is not my <HI>American</HI> &s;tyle, nor that which belongs to me, in the matter in que&s;tion; for, as &s;uch, I keep no deputies.</P>
<P N="3">III. I live not on the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Skulkil,</HI> nor any deputy of mine; and I conceive Colonel <HI>Talbot</HI> could not, by that commi&s;&s;ion, come to the ea&s;t &s;ide, to make his demand; which yet he did.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I was ab&s;ent, and at <HI>New-York,</HI> when this commi&s;&s;ioner came; and I never did, nor never will, commi&s;&s;ion any deputy to treat and conclude away my inheritance, without my particular di|rection

and command; though, if I were to go for <HI>England,</HI> I would not di&s;own the laws, he &s;hould make in my ab&s;ence, for public good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> when I came back.</P>
<P N="5">V. Colonel <HI>Talbot</HI> is directed, in the com|mi&s;&s;ion, to make the demand, according to a line, &s;aid to be run, in obedience to his maje&s;ty's com|mand, in his letter of the 2d. of April, 1681; but I &s;ay, that no line is yet run, in obedience to his maje&s;ty's command;&mdash;for the letter expre&s;sly &s;aith, that the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> or his agent, &s;hall, together with my agent, agree to the latitude, and then run the line, and bound the provinces accord|ingly; which is not yet done: For tho&s;e ob&s;erva|tions, and the line run by them, are performed by the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> and his agents only, and there|fore not according to his maje&s;ty's command, in his letter of the 2d. of April, 1681, nor, in my opi|nion, common equity; for I knew nothing of them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. To &s;ay (as his commi&s;&s;ion doth) that my commi&s;&s;ioners refu&s;ed to comply with the &s;aid let|ter, is hard for me to do; &s;ince the chiefe&s;t of them brought it in my favour. But the truth is, (if they &s;ay true, and circum&s;tances favour them) the thing is improbable; for the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> would have had them agreed to have taken an ob|&s;ervation upon the river <HI>Delaware,</HI> when as the King's letter (&s;tating my bounds, as they are ex|pre&s;&s;ed in my patent) begins twelve miles above <HI>New-ca&s;tle,</HI> upon the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Delaware</HI> river, and &s;o to run to the 43d. degree of north lati|tude, upon the &s;aid river; which makes it impo&s;&s;i|ble, that the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> could come within tho&s;e limits to take an ob&s;ervation, or run a line, in pur&s;uance of his maje&s;ty's commands, in the &s;aid letter; &s;ince taking an ob&s;ervation on <HI>Delaware</HI> river (which, &s;ay they, he pre&s;&s;ed) is a plain viola|tion of it. They further &s;ay, that they never re|fu&s;ed, but pre&s;&s;ed the taking of an ob&s;ervation,
<PB N="278" REF="032729_0278_0FF4F1C370F449A0">
according to his maje&s;ty's letter; which is grounded on the bounds of my patent;<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> and when the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> and my agent had agreed to meet at <HI>New-ca&s;tle,</HI> and to proceed according to his ma|je&s;ty's letter, 'tis true that my agent came not, and as true, &s;aith he, that the rea&s;on was the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> called immediately at <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> alias, <HI>Marcus Hooks,</HI> as he went to <HI>New-ca&s;tle,</HI> and for|bad the inhabitants to pay me <HI>Quit-rent,</HI> and named the place by a new name, before any line was run, or any ob&s;ervation agreed; which being a declared breach of the King's commands, and their treaty, in the opinion of my agent, he re|fu&s;ed to meet the next day about a matter, the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had, in &s;uch a manner, already determined.</P>
<P N="7">VII. But what fault &s;oever they were in, &s;ure I am, that, before an ob&s;ervation was agree, or any line was run, I came in, and &s;uddenly after waited upon the Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI> I pre&s;ented him with another letter from his maje&s;ty; which he was &s;o far from complying with, that he looked upon the King, as mi&s;taken, and &s;et his patent in direct oppo&s;ition; and to this day would never hear of complying with it, in either of the two points it related to; that is to &s;ay, his having but two degrees, and that beginning them at <HI>Watkins's</HI> point, he &s;hould admea&s;ure them, at &s;ixty miles to a degree, to terminate the north bounds of his province. Now, in my opinion, it was not pro|per to ground his proceedings upon a former let|ter, in neglect of a later advice and command from his maje&s;ty: Nor doth it look very ju&s;t to make the caution, or neglect of an agent, in the ab&s;ence of his principal, a rea&s;on to proceed again&s;t his principal, when pre&s;ent with other in&s;tructions, without due regard had to him, or his allegations. And I mu&s;t &s;ay, that, at <HI>New-ca&s;tle,</HI> when I pre&s;|&s;ed the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> to &s;it in one hou&s;e with his

This I writ, accor|ding to his de&s;ire, and &s;ent after him, to &s;ell he refu&s;ed, but &s;tarted an exchange of part of that bay for the lower counties, on the bay of <HI>Delaware.</HI> This, I pre&s;ume, he knew I could not do; for his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> had the one half; and I did not prize the thing, I de&s;ired, at &s;uch a rate.

<P N="8">VIII. To the <HI>demand, viz.</HI> Of all that land on <HI>Delaware</HI> river to the &s;outh of the fortieth de|gree of north latitude, I have this to &s;ay, that 'tis very odd the demand &s;hould be made &s;everal months after the proclamation was put forth, to encourage people to plant mo&s;t of the parts de|manded; but much more &s;trange, that, after the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had declared under his hand, that he did not by that intend to break our amicable treaty, he &s;hould, without further provocation given, proceed to demand tho&s;e parts! Certainly, this was not intended to continue our friend&s;hip; nor did it look with common decency, that Colo|nel <HI>Talbot</HI> &s;hould not think me worth leaving a letter at my hou&s;e, where he lodged, when he went away, as well as the land worth &s;uch a de|mand. But, indeed, his carriage all along &s;hews, he came to defie me, not treat me, like either a neighbour, or gentleman. A &s;udden change amu|&s;ing the King's people, under my charge, by threats, or drawing them off their obedience, by degrading mine; and invitations to the Lord <HI>Bal|timore's</HI> government. This I found at my return, in his conduct (though not in his commi&s;&s;ion) as &s;ome of the people do aver.</P>
<P N="9">IX. But, in the next place, the Lord <HI>Balti|more</HI> hath no warrant to run his line to the river of <HI>Delaware,</HI> neither by the King's letter, nor his own patent, if he peru&s;eth them well, where he will find the <HI>bay,</HI> but not the <HI>river,</HI> of <HI>Delaware.</HI></P>

<P>TRUSTY and well-beloved friends, I &s;alute you all with &s;incere affection, de&s;iring your temporal and eternal pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>I have con&s;tituted you, or any three of you, Governor, and &s;o are properly <HI>the Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> of the government; to act, as if I were pre&s;ent: And I hope is will conduce to your honor, and the peace and happine&s;s of the people, under your care. I found my former deputation clogged with a long and &s;low tale of per&s;ons, rarely got together, and then with unwillingne&s;s, and &s;ometimes reflections, even, upon me; for their pains of hearing one letter read;&mdash;That time may &s;hew them they were out, in their cen&s;ure, having then contracted their deputation into your hands.&mdash;Be diligent, faithful, loving, and communicate with one another, in things that concern the public; and I no ways doubt, but your breaches will heal, and your example have that effect, that nothing will be left for me to do, but thank and love you, and take plea&s;ure in your comely order and tho&s;e under you.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you draw not &s;everal ways, have no cabals apart, nor re|&s;erves from one another; treat, with a mutual &s;implicity, an entire con|fidence in one another; and if, at any time, you mi&s;take, or mi&s;apprehend, or di&s;&s;ent from one another; let not that appear to the people; &s;hew your virtues but conceal your infirmities; this will wake you awful and re|verent with the people. Ju&s;tice, mercy, temperance of &s;pirit, are high qualities, and nece&s;&s;ary ones in government; I be&s;eech God to &s;it you for his work more and more; by whom all Governors and people in au|thority, ought to be influenced, in their admini&s;tration of temporal things, committed to their care.</P>
<P>Three things occur to me eminently;&mdash;Fir&s;t, that you be watch|ful that none abu&s;e the King, in reference to his dues, &amp;c &mdash;Secondly, That you get the cu&s;tom act revived, with the fir&s;t; for I think that the equalle&s;t, and lea&s;t offen&s;ive way, to &s;upport the government; for &s;ome|thing mu&s;t be done, in that affair, &amp;c. Thirdly, That you retrieve the dignity of courts and &s;e&s;&s;ions; and remove all per&s;ons unqualified in morals or incapacity. Oh, that I could but have that, by your union, gravity, con&s;tant weekly meetings once or twice, as Second-days, and Fifth-days, in the morning or afternoon, to hear, advice, or do what is fit for the public good; that you had recovered the reputation which becomes that province to have;&mdash;For, what with that, which is real, and that malice in your neighbours of &s;ome governments invent, we have much ado to keep our heads above water here.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add no more, but my love to the people, in general; and that &s;o &s;oon as my affairs will let me, I &s;hall be with them: for no poor &s;lave in Turkey, longs more for his freedom. I commit you to God's protec|tion, and bid you heartily farewell.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE>THOUGH the friend&s;hip, with which you are plea&s;ed to honour me, doth afford me &s;uffici|ent opportunities of di&s;cour&s;ing with you, upon any &s;ubject, yet I cho&s;e rather, at this time, to offer unto you, in writing, &s;ome reflections, which have occurred to my thoughts, in a matter of no common importance. The importance of it doth primarily and directly re&s;pect your&s;elf, and your own private concernments; but it al&s;o con&s;equen|tially and effectually regards the King, his govern|ment, and, even, the peace and &s;ettlement of this
<PB N="315" REF="032729_0315_0FF4F29A8C75B280">
whole nation. I intreat you, therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688.</NOTE> to bear with me, if I endeavour, in this manner, to give &s;omewhat more weight unto my words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> than would be in a tran&s;ient di&s;cour&s;e, and leave them with you, as a &s;ubject, that requires your retired con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>You are not ignorant, that the part you have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have had, of late years, in pub|lic affairs, though without either the title, or honor, or profit, of any public office, and that e&s;pecially your avowed endeavours to introduce among&s;t us a general and inviolable <HI>liberty of con|&s;cience,</HI> in matters of mere religion, have occa&s;i|oned the mi&s;takes of &s;ome men, provoked the malice of others, and, in the end, have rai&s;ed again&s;t you a multitude of enemies; who have unworthily defamed you with &s;uch imputations, as, I am &s;ure, you abhor. This I know you have been &s;ufficiently informed of, though I doubt you have not made &s;ufficient reflection upon it: The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own innocence &s;eems to me to have given you too great a contempt of &s;uch unju&s;t and ill-grounded &s;landers. For however glorious it is, and rea&s;onable, for a truly virtuous mind, who&s;e inward peace is founded upon that rock of innocence, to de&s;pi&s;e the empty noi&s;e of popular reproach, yet, even, that &s;ublimity of &s;pirit may &s;ometimes &s;well to a reprovable exce&s;s. To be &s;teady and immovable, in the pro&s;ecution of wi&s;e and hone&s;t re&s;olutions, by all hone&s;t and prudent means, is, indeed, a duty, that admits of no exception: But, neverthele&s;s, it ought not to hinder that, at the &s;ame time, there be al&s;o due care taken of pre&s;erving a fair reputation. <HI>"A good name,</HI> &s;ays the wi&s;e man, <HI>is better than pre|cious ointment."</HI> It is a perfume, that recommends the per&s;on, whom it accompanies, that procures him every where an ea&s;y acceptance; and that fa|cilitates the &s;ucce&s;s of all his enterpri&s;es: And for
<PB N="316" REF="032729_0316_0FF4F29C1A47C880">
that rea&s;on, though there were no other, I en|treat you, ob&s;erve, that the care of a man's repu|tation is an e&s;&s;ential part of that very &s;ame duty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> that engages him in the pur&s;uit of any worthy de&s;ign.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not entertain you with a declama|tion upon this general theme: my bu&s;ine&s;s is to repre&s;ent to you, more particularly, tho&s;e very imputations, which are ca&s;t upon your&s;elf, toge|ther with &s;ome of their evident con&s;equences; that, if po&s;&s;ible, I may thereby move you to la|bour after a remedy. The &s;ource of all ari&s;es from the ordinary acce&s;s, you have unto the King, the credit you are &s;uppo&s;ed to have with him, and the deep jealou&s;y, that &s;ome people have conceived of his intentions, in reference to religion. Their jealou&s;y is, that his aim has been to &s;ettle <HI>Popery</HI> in this nation, not only in a fair and &s;ecure liberty, but, even, in a predominating &s;uperiority over all other profe&s;&s;ions: And from thence the inference follows, that who&s;oever has any part in the coun|cils of this reign, mu&s;t needs be popi&s;hly affected: But that, to have &s;o great a part in them, as you are &s;aid to have had, can happen to none, but an <HI>ab&s;olute Papi&s;t.</HI> That is the direct charge; but that is not enough; your part is too con&s;iderable for a Papi&s;t of an ordinary form; and, therefore, you mu&s;t be a <HI>Je&s;uit:</HI> Nay, to confirm that &s;ug|ge&s;tion, it mu&s;t be accompanied with all the cir|cum&s;tances, that may be&s;t give it an air of proba|bility; as, that you have been bred at <HI>St. Omer's,</HI> in the <HI>Je&s;uit's college;</HI> that you have taken <HI>orders</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and there obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation to mar|ry; and that you have &s;ince then frequently offici|ated, as a <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> in the celebration of the <HI>ma&s;s,</HI> at <HI>White-Hall, St. James's,</HI> and other places. And this being admitted, nothing can be too black to be ca&s;t upon you. What&s;oever is thought ami&s;s, either in church or &s;tate, though never &s;o contrary to your advice, is boldly attributed to it; and, if
<PB N="317" REF="032729_0317_0FF4F29DAE70FE08">
other proofs fail, the Scripture it&s;elf mu&s;t be brought in to confirm, "That who&s;oever offends, in one point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> (in a point e&s;pecially &s;o e&s;&s;ential as that of our too much affected uniformity) is guilty of the breach of all our laws." Thus the charge of <HI>Popery</HI> draws after it a tail like the <HI>et caetera oath,</HI> and by endle&s;s innuendos prejudicates you, as guilty of what&s;oever malice can invent, or folly believe: But that charge, therefore, being re|moved, the inferences, that are drawn from it, will vani&s;h, and your reputation will ea&s;ily return to its former brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, that I might the more effectually per|&s;wade you to apply &s;ome remedy to this di&s;ea&s;e, I be&s;eech you, Sir, &s;uffer me to lay before you &s;ome of its pernicious con&s;equences. It is not a trifling matter, for a per&s;on, rai&s;ed as you are, above the common level, to lie under the prejudice of &s;o general a mi&s;take, in &s;o important a matter. The general, and the long prevalency of any opinion gives it a &s;trength, e&s;pecially among the vulgar, that is not ea&s;ily &s;haken. And, as it happens that you have al&s;o enemies of an higher rank, who will be ready to improve &s;uch popular mi&s;takes, by all arts of malicious artifices, it mu&s;t be taken for granted that tho&s;e errors will be there|by &s;till more confirmed, and the inconveniences, that may ari&s;e from thence, no le&s;s increa&s;ed. This, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you, is a melancholy pro&s;pect to your friends; for we know you have &s;uch enemies. The de&s;ign of &s;o univer&s;al a liberty of con&s;cience, as your principles have led you to pro|mote, has offended many of tho&s;e, who&s;e intere&s;t is to cro&s;s it. I need not tell you how many, and how powerful they are; nor can I tell you either how far, or by what ways and means they may endeavour to execute their revenge. But this, however, I mu&s;t needs tell you, that, in your pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, there is &s;ufficient ground
<PB N="318" REF="032729_0318_0FF4F29F41E32780">
for &s;o much jealou&s;y, at lea&s;t, as ought to excite you to u&s;e the precaution of &s;ome public vindica|tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> This the tenderne&s;s of friend&s;hip prompts your friends to de&s;ire of you; and this the ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of your honor, which true religion does not extingui&s;h, requires you to execute.</P>
<P>Pardon, I entreat you, Sir, the earne&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions; nay, &s;uffer me, without of|fence, to expo&s;tulate with you yet a little farther. I am fearful le&s;t the&s;e per&s;onal con&s;iderations &s;hould not have their due weight with you, and therefore, I cannot omit to reflect al&s;o upon &s;ome more general con&s;equences of your particular re|proach. I have &s;aid it already, that the King, his honour, his government, and, even, the peace and &s;ettlement of this whole nation, either are, or have been, concerned in this matter: Your reputation, as you are &s;aid to have meddled in public affairs, have been of public concernment. The promoting a general liberty of con&s;cience having been your particular province; the a&s;per|&s;ion of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Je&s;uiti&s;m,</HI> that has been ca&s;t upon <HI>you,</HI> has reflected upon his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> for having made u&s;e, in that affair, of &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed a per&s;onage as you are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been. It has weakened the force of all your endeavours, ob&s;tructed their effect, and contributed greatly to di&s;appoint this poor nation of that ine&s;timable hap|pine&s;s, and &s;ecure e&s;tabli&s;hment, which, I am per|&s;waded, you de&s;igned, and which all good and wi&s;e men agree, that a ju&s;t and inviolable liberty of con&s;cience would infallibly produce. I heartily wi&s;h this con&s;ideration had been &s;ooner laid to heart, and that &s;ome demon&s;trative evidence of your &s;incerity, in the profe&s;&s;ion you make, had accompanied all your endeavours for liberty.</P>
<P>But, what do I &s;ay, or what do I wi&s;h for? I confe&s;s that I am now &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at that abundant evidence, which I know you have
<PB N="319" REF="032729_0319_0FF4F2ABDC1B4448">
con&s;tantly given, of the oppo&s;ition of your prin|ciples to tho&s;e of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church, and at the little regard, there has been had to it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> If an open profe&s;&s;ion of the directe&s;t oppo&s;ition again&s;t <HI>Popery,</HI> that has ever appeared in the world, &s;ince <HI>Popery</HI> was fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>common Chri&s;tia|nity,</HI> would &s;erve the turn, this cannot be denied to all tho&s;e of that <HI>&s;ociety,</HI> with which you are joined in the duties of religious wor&s;hip. If to have maintained the principles of that &s;ociety, by frequent and fervent di&s;cour&s;es, by many elaborate writings, by &s;uffering ignominy, impri&s;onment, and other manyfold di&s;advantages, in defence there|of, can be admitted as any proof of your &s;incere adherence thereunto; this, it is evident to the world, you have done already: Nay, farther, if to have enquired as far as was po&s;&s;ible for you, into the particular &s;tories, that have been framed again&s;t you, and to have &s;ought all means of recti|fying the mi&s;takes, upon which they were ground|ed, could, in any mea&s;ure avail to the &s;ettling a true character of you, in men's judgments; this al&s;o I know you have done. For I have &s;een, un|der the hand of a reverend Dean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tillot&s;on.</NOTE> of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> church, a full acknowledgment of &s;atisfaction, re|ceived from you, in a &s;u&s;picion he had entertained, upon one of tho&s;e &s;tories, and to which his re|port had procured too great credit. And though I know you are aver&s;e to the publi&s;hing of his let|ter, without his expre&s;s leave, and, perhaps, may not now think fit to a&s;k it; yet I am &s;o thoroughly a&s;&s;ured of his &s;incerity and candour, that I cannot doubt, but he has already vindicated you, in that matter, and will, (according to his promi&s;e) be &s;till ready to do it, upon all occa&s;ions. Nay, I have &s;een al&s;o your ju&s;tification from another ca|lumny of common fame, about your having kid|napped one, who had been formerly a <HI>Monk,</HI> out of your <HI>American</HI> province, to deliver him here into the hands of his enemies; I &s;ay I have &s;een
<PB N="320" REF="032729_0320_0FF4F2AD6B7198E8">
your ju&s;tification from that &s;tory, under that per|&s;on's own hand: and his return to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> where he now re&s;ides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> may be an irrefragable con|futation of it, to any that will take the pains to enquire thereinto.</P>
<P>Really, it afflicts me very much, to con&s;ider that all this does not &s;uffice. If I had not that particular re&s;pect for you, which I &s;incerely pro|fe&s;s, yet I could not but be much affected, that any man, who had de&s;ervedly acquired &s;o fair a reputation, as you have formerly had, who&s;e in|tegrity and veracity had always been reputed &s;potle&s;s, and who&s;e charity had been continually exerci&s;ed in &s;erving others, at the dear expence of his time, his &s;trength and his e&s;tate, without any other recompence than what re&s;ults from the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing good; I &s;ay, I could not but be much affected, to &s;ee any &s;uch per&s;on fall inno|cently and unde&s;ervedly under &s;uch unju&s;t re|proaches, as you have done. It is an hard ca&s;e; and I think, no man, that has any bowels of hu|manity, can reflect upon it, without great relent|ings.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, it is &s;o, and that &s;omething remains yet to be done, &s;omething more expre&s;s, and e&s;pecially more public, than has yet been done, for your vindication, I beg of you, dear Sir, by all the tender efficacy, that friend&s;hip, either mine, or that of your friends and relations together can have upon you, by the due regard, which huma|nity, and, even, Chri&s;tianity, obliges you to have to your reputation; by the duty, you owe unto the King, by your love to the land of your nati|vity; and by the cau&s;e of univer&s;al religion and eternal truth, let not the &s;candal of in&s;incerity, that I have hinted at, lie any longer upon you; but let the &s;en&s;e of all the&s;e obligations per&s;wade you to gratify your friends and relations, and to &s;erve your King, your country and your religion,

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now above twenty years, I thank God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W. Popple.</NOTE> that I have not been very &s;olicitous what the world thought of me. For &s;ince I have had the know|ledge of religion, from a <HI>principle</HI> in <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> the fir&s;t and main point with me has been, to approve my&s;elf in the &s;ight of God, through patience and well-doing: So that the world has not had weight enough with me, to &s;uffer its good opinion to rai&s;e me, or its ill opinion to deject me. And, if that had been the only motive, or con&s;ideration, and not the de&s;ire of a good friend, in the name of many others, I had been as &s;ilent to thy letter, as I u&s;e to be to the idle and malicious &s;hams of the times: But, as the laws of friend&s;hip are &s;acred, with tho&s;e that value that relation, &s;o I confe&s;s this to be a principal one with me, not to deny a friend the &s;atisfaction he de&s;ires, when it may be done without offence to a good con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s chiefly in&s;i&s;ted upon is my <HI>Popery,</HI> and endeavours to promote it. I do &s;ay, then, and that with all &s;incerity, that I am not only no <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> but no <HI>Papi&s;t.</HI> And, which is more, I never had any temptation upon me to be it, either from doubts, in my own mind, about the way I
<PB N="322" REF="032729_0322_0FF4F31997258D68">
profe&s;s, or from the di&s;cour&s;es, or writings of any of that religion. And, in the pre&s;ence of Al|mighty God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W. Popple.</NOTE> I do declare, that the King did never once, directly or indirectly attack me, or tempt me, upon that &s;ubject, the many years, that I have had the advantage of a free acce&s;s to him; &s;o unju&s;t, as well as &s;ordidly fal&s;e, are all tho&s;e &s;tories of the town.</P>
<P>The only rea&s;on, that I can apprehend, they have to repute me a <HI>Roman Catholic,</HI> is my frequent going to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> a place no more forbid to me, than to the re&s;t of the world, who yet, it &s;eems, find much fairer quarter. I have almo&s;t continually had one bu&s;ine&s;s or other there for our Friends, whom I ever &s;erved with a &s;teady &s;olicitation, through all times, &s;ince I was of their communion. I had al&s;o a great many per|&s;onal good offices to do, upon a principle of cha|rity, for people of all per&s;wa&s;ions; thinking it a duty to improve the little intere&s;t I had, for the good of tho&s;e, that needed it, e&s;pecially the poor. I might add &s;omething of my own affairs too; though I mu&s;t own (if I may without vanity) that they have ever had the lea&s;t &s;hare of my thoughts, or pains, or el&s;e they would not have &s;till depended as they yet do.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e &s;ome people are &s;o unju&s;t, as to render in&s;tances for my <HI>Popery</HI> (or, rather hypo|cri&s;y, for &s;o it would be in me) it is fit I contradict them as particularly as they accu&s;e me. I &s;ay, then, &s;olemnly, that I am &s;o far from having been bred at <HI>St. Omer's,</HI> and having received orders at <HI>Rome,</HI> that I never was at either place, nor do I know any body there; nor had I ever a corre&s;pon|dency with any body, in tho&s;e places; which is another &s;tory invented again&s;t me. And, as for my officiating in the King's chapel, or any other, it is &s;o ridiculous, as well as untrue, that be&s;ides that no body can do it, but a <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> and that I
<PB N="323" REF="032729_0323_0FF4F2B09414F9D8">
have been married to a woman of &s;ome condition, above &s;ixteen years, which no Prie&s;t can be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W. Popple.</NOTE> by any di&s;pen&s;ation whatever; I have not &s;o much as looked into <HI>any</HI> chapel of the <HI>Roman</HI> religion, and con&s;equently not the King's, though common cu|rio&s;ity warrants it daily to people of all per&s;wa|&s;ions.</P>
<P>And, once for all, I do &s;ay, that I am a <HI>Pro|te&s;tant di&s;&s;enter,</HI> and to that degree &s;uch, that I challenge the mo&s;t celebrated Prote&s;tant of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> church, or any other, on that head, be he Layman, or Clergyman, in public, or in private. For I would have &s;uch people know, it is not im|po&s;&s;ible for a <HI>true Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enter</HI> to be dutiful, thankful and &s;erviceable to the <HI>King,</HI> though he be of the <HI>Roman catholic communion.</HI> We hold not our property, or protection, from him, by our per&s;wa&s;ion; and, therefore, his per&s;wa&s;ion &s;hould not be the mea&s;ure of our allegiance. I am &s;orry to &s;ee &s;o many, that &s;eem fond of the reformed religion, by their di&s;affection to him, recommend it &s;o ill. Whatever practices of <HI>Roman catholics</HI> we might rea&s;onably object again&s;t (and no doubt but &s;uch there are) yet he has di&s;claimed and repre|hended tho&s;e ill things, by his declared opinion again&s;t <HI>per&s;ecution,</HI> by the ea&s;e, in which he actu|ally indulges all di&s;&s;enters; and by the confirmation, he offers in Parliament, for the &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tant religion, and liberty of con&s;cience. And, in his honour, as well as in my own defence, I am obliged, in con&s;cience, to &s;ay, that he has ever declared to me, <HI>it was his opinion;</HI> and on all oc|ca&s;ions, when Duke, he never refu&s;ed me the repeated proofs of it, as often as I had any poor &s;ufferers for con&s;cience &s;ake to &s;olicit his help for.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may be apt to &s;ay, "Why not any body el&s;e as well as I? Why mu&s;t I have the pre|ferable acce&s;s to other di&s;&s;enters, if not a <HI>Papi&s;t?"</HI> I an&s;wer, I know not that it is &s;o. But this I know,
<PB N="324" REF="032729_0324_0FF4F2BD90CD1DF0">
that I have made it my province and bu&s;ine&s;s; I have followed and pre&s;&s;ed it; I took it for my cal|ling and &s;tation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W. Popple.</NOTE> and have kept it above the&s;e &s;ix|teen years; and, which is more (if I may &s;ay it without vanity or reproach) wholly at my own charges too. To this let me add the relation, that my father had to this King's &s;ervice; his particular favour, in getting me relea&s;ed out of the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in 1669; my father's humble reque&s;t to him, upon his death bed, to protect me from the inconveniencies and troubles, my per&s;wa&s;ion might expo&s;e me to, and his friendly promi&s;e to do it, and exact performance of it, from the moment, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to him:&mdash;I &s;ay, when all this is con&s;idered, any body, that has the lea&s;t pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to good nature, gratitude, or genero&s;ity, mu&s;t needs know how to interpret my acce&s;s to the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps, &s;ome will be ready to &s;ay, "This is not all, nor is this yet a fault, but, that I have been an advi&s;er in other matters, di&s;gu&s;tful to the kingdom, and which tend to the overthrow of the Prote&s;tant religion, and the liberties of the peo|ple."&mdash;A likely thing, indeed, that a Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enter, who, from fifteen years old, has been, at times, a &s;ufferer, in his father's family, in the univer&s;ity, and by the government, for being &s;o, &s;hould de&s;ign the <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of the Prote&s;tant re|ligion! This is ju&s;t as probable, as it is true, that I died a <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> &s;ix years ago, in <HI>America.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See page 246.</NOTE> Will men &s;till &s;uffer &s;uch &s;tuff to pa&s;s upon them? Is any thing more fooli&s;h, as well as fal&s;e, than that, becau&s;e I am often at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> therefore I mu&s;t be the author of all, that is done there, which does not plea&s;e abroad? But, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome &s;uch things to have been done, pray tell me, if I am bound to oppo&s;e any thing, that I am not called to do? I never was a member of council, cabinet, or committee, where the affairs of the kingdom
<PB N="325" REF="032729_0325_0FF4F2BF1F2C6860">
are tran&s;acted. I have had no office, or tru&s;t, and con&s;equently nothing can be &s;aid to be done by me; nor, for that rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W. Popple.</NOTE> could I lie under any te&s;t, or obligation to di&s;cover my opinion of public acts of &s;tate; and therefore neither can any &s;uch acts, nor my &s;ilence about them, in ju&s;tice, be made my crime. Volunteers are blanks and cyphers, in all governments. And unle&s;s calling at <HI>White-Hall</HI> once a day, upon many occa&s;ions, or my not being turned out of nothing (for that no office is) be the evidence of my compliance in di&s;agreeable things, I know not what el&s;e can, with any truth, be alledged again&s;t me. However, one thing I know, that I have every where mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">giou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y ob&s;erved, and endeavoured, in con|ver&s;ation, with per&s;ons of all ranks and opinions, to allay heats, and moderate extremes, even, in the politics. It is below me to be more particular; but, I am &s;ure, it has been my endeavour, that, if we could not all meet upon a religious bottom, at lea&s;t, we might upon a civil one, the good of <HI>England;</HI> which is the common intere&s;t of King and people: That he might be great by ju&s;tice, and we free by obedience, di&s;tingui&s;hing rightly, on the one hand, between duty and &s;lavery; and on the other, between liberty and licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But, alas, I am not without my apprehen|&s;ions of the cau&s;e of this behaviour towards me, and in this, I perceive, we agree; I mean my con&s;tant zeal for an <HI>impartial</HI> liberty of con&s;cience. But, if that be it, the cau&s;e is too good to be in pain about. I ever under&s;tood that to be the na|tural right of all men; and that he that had a re|ligion without it, his religion was none of his own. For what is not the religion of a man's <HI>choice,</HI> is the religion of him that impo&s;es it: So that liberty of con&s;cience is the fir&s;t &s;tep to have a religion. This is no new opinion with me. I have writ many apologies, within the la&s;t twenty years, to
<PB N="326" REF="032729_0326_0FF4F2C0B26E7238">
defend it, and that impartially. Yet I have as con&s;tantly declared, that bounds ought to be &s;et to this freedom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W. Popple.</NOTE> and that morality was the <HI>be&s;t;</HI> and that as often as that was violated, under a pre|&s;ence of con&s;cience, it was fit the civil power &s;hould take place. Nor did I ever once think of promoting any &s;ort of liberty of con&s;cience, for any body which did not pre&s;erve the <HI>common pro|te&s;tancy</HI> of the kingdom, and the <HI>ancient rights</HI> of the government. For, to &s;ay truth, the one cannot be maintained without the other.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>I love England;</HI> I ever did &s;o; and that I am not in her debt&punc; I never valued time, money, or kindred, to &s;erve her and do her good. No party could ever bia&s;s me to her prejudice, nor any per&s;onal intere&s;t oblige me in her wrong. For I always abhorred di&s;counting <HI>private favours</HI> at the <HI>public co&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Would I have made my market of the fears and jealou&s;ies of the people, when this King came to the crown, I had put twenty thou&s;and pounds into my pocket, and an hundred thou&s;and into my province; for mighty numbers of people were then upon the wing: But I waved it all; hoped for better times; expected the effects of the King's word, for liberty of con&s;cience, and happine&s;s by it: And till I &s;aw my friends, with the kingdom, delivered from the legal bondage, which penal laws, for religion, had &s;ubjected them to, I could, with no &s;atisfaction, think of leaving <HI>England;</HI> though much to my prejudice beyond &s;ea; and at my great expence here; having, in all this time never had either office or pen&s;ion, and always re|fu&s;ing the rewards, or gratuities, of tho&s;e, I have been able to oblige.</P>
<P>If, therefore, an <HI>univer&s;al charity,</HI> if the a&s;|&s;erting an <HI>impartial liberty of con&s;cience,</HI> if <HI>doing to others as one would be done by,</HI> and an <HI>open avowing,</HI>

For the&s;e are corner-&s;tones and principles with me; and I am &s;candalized at all buildings, that have them not for their foundations. For religion it&s;elf is an empty name without them, a whited wall, a painted &s;epulchre, no <HI>life</HI> or <HI>virtue</HI> to the &s;oul; no good, or example, to one's neighbour. Let us not flatter our&s;elves, "We can never be the better for our religion, if our neighbour be the wor&s;e for it." Our fault is, we are apt to be mighty hot upon &s;peculative errors, and break all bounds, in our re&s;entments; but we let practical ones pa&s;s without remark, if not without repen|tance: As if a mi&s;take about an <HI>ob&s;cure propo&s;ition of faith,</HI> were a greater evil, than the breach of an undoubted precept. Such a religion the devils them&s;elves are not without; for they have both faith and knowledge; but their faith doth not work by love, nor their knowledge by obedience. And, if this be their judgment, can it be our ble&s;&s;ing? Let us not think religion a litigious thing; nor that Chri&s;t came only to make us good di&s;pu|tants; but, that he came al&s;o to make us good livers. Sincerity goes farther than capacity. It is <HI>charity,</HI> that de&s;ervedly excels, in the Chri&s;tian religion; and happy would it be, if, where unity ends, charity did begin, in&s;tead of envy and rail|ing, that almo&s;t ever follow. It appears to me to be the way, that God has found out and appoin|ted, to moderate our differences, and make them, at lea&s;t, harmle&s;s to &s;ociety; and, therefore, I confe&s;s, I dare not aggravate them to wrath and blood. Our di&s;agreement lies in our <HI>apprehen&s;ion,</HI>
<PB N="328" REF="032729_0328_0FF4F31B273D4DA8">
or <HI>belief</HI> of things; and if the common enemy of mankind had not the governing of our affections and pa&s;&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W. Popple.</NOTE> that di&s;agreement would not prove &s;uch a canker, as it is, to love and peace, in civil &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>He that &s;uffers his difference with his neigh|bour, about the other world, to carry him beyond the line of moderation, in this, is the wor&s;e for his <HI>opinion,</HI> even, though it be true. It is too little con&s;idered by <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that men may hold the <HI>truth</HI> in <HI>unrighteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> that they may be <HI>ortho|dox,</HI> and not know what <HI>&s;pirit they are of:</HI> So were the Apo&s;tles of our Lord; they believed in him, yet let a fal&s;e <HI>zeal</HI> do violence to their judg|ment, and their unwarrantable <HI>heat</HI> contradict the great end of their Saviour's coming, <HI>love.</HI></P>
<P>Men may be angry for God's &s;ake, and kill people too. Chri&s;t &s;aid it, and too many have practi&s;ed it. But what &s;ort of Chri&s;tians mu&s;t they be, I pray, that can <HI>hate</HI> in his name, who bids us <HI>love;</HI> and <HI>kill</HI> for his &s;ake, that forbids <HI>killing,</HI> and commands <HI>love,</HI> even, to enemies.</P>
<P>Let not men, or parties, think to &s;hift it off from them&s;elves. It is not this <HI>principle,</HI> or that <HI>form,</HI> to which &s;o great a defection is owing, but a degeneracy of mind from God. Chri&s;tianity is not at <HI>heart.</HI> No fear of God in the inward parts: No awe of his divine omnipre&s;ence. <HI>Self</HI> prevails, and breaks out, more or le&s;s, through all forms, but too plainly; (pride, wrath, lu&s;t, avarice) &s;o that though people &s;ay to God, <HI>Thy will be done;</HI> which &s;hews them to be true heathens, under a ma&s;k of Chri&s;tianity, that believe without works, and repent without for&s;aking; bu&s;y for <HI>forms,</HI> and the temporal benefits of them, while <HI>true religion,</HI> which is, <HI>To vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and the widow, and to keep our&s;elves un&s;potted from the world,</HI> goes bare|foot, and, like <HI>Lazarus,</HI> is de&s;pi&s;ed. Yet this was the definition the Holy Gho&s;t gave of religion,
<PB N="329" REF="032729_0329_0FF4F2CEE06F1DA8">
before <HI>Synods</HI> and <HI>Councils</HI> had the meddling with it, and modelling of it. In tho&s;e days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W.

It was &s;aid by him, that could not &s;ay ami&s;s, <HI>Becau&s;e iniquity abounds, the love of many waxeth cold.</HI> What&s;oever divides man's heart from <HI>God,</HI> &s;epa|rates it from his <HI>neighbour;</HI> and he, that loves <HI>&s;elf</HI> more than <HI>God,</HI> can never love his <HI>neighbour</HI> as him&s;elf. For, as the Apo&s;tle &s;aid, "If we do not love him, whom we have &s;een, how can we love God, whom we have not &s;een?"</P>
<P>O, that we could &s;ee &s;ome men as eager to turn people to <HI>God,</HI> as they are to blow them up, and &s;et them one again&s;t another. But, indeed, tho&s;e only can have that pure and pious zeal, who are them&s;elves turned to God, and have ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of that conver&s;ion, which is to <HI>power,</HI> not <HI>form;</HI> to <HI>godline&s;s,</HI> not <HI>gain.</HI> Such as tho&s;e do bend their thoughts and pains to appea&s;e, not increa&s;e, heats and animo&s;ities; to exhort people to look at home, &s;weep their own hou&s;es, and weed their own gardens. And, in no age, or time, was there more need to &s;et men at work, in their own hearts, than this we live in, when &s;o bu&s;y, wandering, licentious a &s;pirit prevails. For what|ever &s;ome men may think, "The di&s;ea&s;e of this kingdom is <HI>&s;in;</HI> impiety again&s;t <HI>God,</HI> and want of <HI>charity</HI> to men." And while this guilt is at our door, judgment cannot be far off.</P>
<P>Now, this being the di&s;ea&s;e, I will briefly offer two things, for the cure of it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is <HI>David's clean heart,</HI> and <HI>right &s;pirit,</HI> which he a&s;ked and had of God: without this we mu&s;t be a <HI>chaos</HI> &s;till. For the di&s;temper is <HI>within;</HI> and our Lord &s;aid, <HI>All evil</HI> comes from thence. Set the <HI>inward man right,</HI> and the <HI>out|ward

man cannot be wrong:</HI> That is the helm, that governs the human ve&s;&s;el: And this nothing can do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W. People.</NOTE> but an <HI>inward principle,</HI> the <HI>light</HI> and <HI>grace,</HI> that came by Chri&s;t; which the &s;cripture tells us, <HI>enlightens every one, and hath appeared to all men."</HI> It is prepo&s;terous to think, that <HI>He,</HI> who made the world, &s;hould &s;hew lea&s;t care of the be&s;t part of it, our <HI>&s;ouls.</HI> No, he, that gave us an outward luminary, for our bodies, hath given us an in|ward one, for our minds, to act by. We have it; and it is our condemnation, that we do not love it, and bring our deeds to it. It is by this we &s;ee our &s;ins, are made &s;en&s;ible of them, &s;orry for them, and finally for&s;ake them. And he, that thinks to go to Heaven a nearer way, will, I fear, belate his &s;oul, and be irreparably mi&s;taken. There are but <HI>goats</HI> and <HI>&s;heep,</HI> at la&s;t, whatever &s;hapes we wear here. Let us not, therefore, dear friend, deceive our&s;elves. Our &s;ouls are at &s;take: "God will not be mocked; what we &s;ow we mu&s;t expect to reap. There is no repentance in the grave;" which &s;hews, that, if none there, then no where el&s;e. To &s;um up this divinity of mine; it is the <HI>light</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in our &s;ouls, that gives us a true &s;ight of our&s;elves, and that &s;ight that leads us to repentance; which repentance begets humi|lity, and humility, that true <HI>charity,</HI> that covers a multitude of faults; which I call God's <HI>expedi|ent</HI> again&s;t man's <HI>infirmity.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd remedy to our pre&s;ent di&s;temper, is this; &s;ince all, of all parties, profe&s;s to believe in God, Chri&s;t, the Spirit, and Scripture; that the &s;oul is immortal, that there are eternal rewards and pu|ni&s;hments; and that the virtuous &s;hall receive the one, and the wicked &s;uffer the other; I &s;ay, &s;ince this is the common faith of Chri&s;tendom, let us all re&s;olve, in the &s;trength of God, to live up to what we agree in, before we fall out &s;o mi&s;erably, about the re&s;t, in which we differ.

the change and comfort, which that pious cour&s;e would bring us to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's an&s;wer to W.

<HEAD>William Penn, Proprietor and Governor,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To my truly and well-beloved friends, Thomas Lloyd, Robert Turner, John Eckle, John Simcock and Arthur Cook, commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;tate, for the province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> or any three of them:&mdash;</HEAD>
<P>I &s;alute you all with unfeigned love, and, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, wi&s;h you health and happine&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>My la&s;t is by the &s;ame hand, this being &s;ent to the <HI>Downs</HI> after him, upon the receipt of Thomas Lloyd's and William Markham's letter: But I am heartily &s;orry that I had no letter from the government: in|deed I have hardly had one at all: and for private letters though from public per&s;ons, I regard them but little; I mean as to taking my public mea&s;ures by: for I find &s;uch contradictions, as well as diver&s;ity, that I believe, I may &s;ay, I am one of the unhappie&s;t Proprietaries, with one of the be&s;t people. If this had not been complained of in mine by Ed|ward Black&s;an, I &s;hould have been le&s;s moved at this vi&s;ible incompla|cency and neglect.&mdash;Had the government &s;igned, I mean tho&s;e, who are the mo&s;t eminent in authority, by con&s;ent of the re&s;t, it had given me &s;ome ca&s;e and &s;atisfaction; but, as it is, 'tis controver&s;y rather than government, which &s;tands and lives and pro&s;pers in unity, at lea&s;t of the governing part, whatever be their affections; for men may agree in duty, that di&s;|like one another's natural tempers.&mdash;I &s;hall henceforth, therefore, ex|pect letters from the government, recounting the affairs of it, that they may be authoritative to me; and as many private ones as you plea&s;e be|&s;ides; for that I al&s;o, rejoice in, and any particular advice, that may in|form me, as to the public, or remedy what may be ami&s;s, or meliorate what is, in it&s;elf, well, will al&s;o be very acceptable to me.</P>
<P>Now I have &s;aid this, I cannot but condole the lo&s;s of &s;ome &s;tand|ards, in the province, hone&s;t men, and of good under&s;tandings, in their kind. The Lord avert his judgments, and con&s;train all, by his vi&s;ita|tions, to amend, be it in conver&s;ation, or be it in peace, concord and charity; they that live near to God, will live far from them&s;elves; and from the &s;en&s;e they have of his nearne&s;s and maje&s;ty, have a low opinion of them&s;elves; and out of that low and humble frame of &s;pirit it is, that true charity grows; the mo&s;t excellent way;&mdash;Ah! what &s;hall I &s;ay, there can be no union, no comfortable &s;ociety without it: Oh, that the people of my province, and parts annexed; felt this gracious quality abounding in them, my work would be done, and their prai&s;e and my joy un&s;peakably abound to us; wherefore, in the name and fear of God, let all old &s;ores be forgotten, as well as forgiven: &s;hut out the remem|brance of them, and preach this doctrine to the people, in my name, yea, in the king's name, and his that is greater above all, <HI>viz.</HI> God Al|mighty's name.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry that <HI>Thomas Lloyd,</HI> my e&s;teemed friend, covets a <HI>Quie|tus,</HI> that is young, active and ingenious; for from &s;uch it is, that I ex|pect help; and &s;uch will not low, I hope, in vain; but &s;ince 'tis his de|&s;ire, I do hereby &s;ignify his <HI>di&s;mi&s;s</HI> from the trouble he has borne, (for &s;ome time of re&s;t and ea&s;e, at lea&s;t) and do nominate, to be commi&s;&s;i|onated in my name, under the great &s;eal, till further order, <HI>Samuel Car|penter,</HI> who, I hope will accept, and indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;erve that &s;tation, el&s;e <HI>Thomas Ellis;</HI> who has an office, that requires his attendance, having one in my eye, that may &s;ee you &s;hortly, as a man richly qualified for that &s;tation: <HI>Robert Turner,</HI> of cour&s;e has the Chair, for the fir&s;t month after the receipt of this, and the re&s;t alternately, monthly, if you find that convenient, as, I believe, it will be mo&s;t ea&s;y, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e let the &s;enior com|mi&s;&s;ioner have it always.</P>
<P>I have only to recommend to you, the due execution of the divers good laws, among you, impartially and diligently, not neglecting the order, from hence &s;ent, e&s;pecially for peace and concord.&mdash;Government is not to make, but to do and di&s;patch bu&s;ine&s;s; in which few words, and a quiet, but a bri&s;k execution does be&s;t; wherefore con&s;ider well what is ju&s;t and fit, the one in law, the other in prudence (where you have room to u&s;e it) pur&s;ue in all ca&s;es; and no matter what any &s;ay, or object.</P>
<P>I writ to you about my <HI>Quit-rents:</HI> I am forced to pay bills here, to &s;upport my family there, while I have 4 or 500 pounds per annum in <HI>Quit-rents</HI> there; you may remember the votes of Council, to pay my charges in this expedition: I could draw a large bill upon the provincial council, in that re&s;pect; I am &s;ure I need it, but have forebore; though it is none of the endearinge&s;t con&s;iderations, that I have not had the pre&s;ent of a &s;kin, or a pound of tobacco &s;ince I came over: though they are like to have the mo&s;t advantage by it, and promi&s;ed me &s;o much!&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, prevent people's withdrawing from us, what you can; they cannot mend them&s;elves; and they that go will find it &s;o, in a while; for I believe, <HI>God has ble&s;&s;ed that poor place;</HI> and the rea&s;on of my &s;tay here, and the &s;ervice I am, and have been of, to the con&s;cientious, &s;hall be rewarded on my &s;olitary province.&mdash;Remember me to the people, and let them know, my heart's de&s;ire towards them; and &s;hall embrace the fir&s;t opportunity to make my abode with them.</P>
<P>Once more, let me hear from you, and have a copy of the laws, as my other letter directs, and you &s;hall &s;oon hear from me to your con|tent; &s;o I bid you heartily farewell.</P>

<P>In, or about, the year 1688, the inhabitants of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and places adjacent, were alarmed
<PB N="336" REF="032729_0336_0FF4F32F1C7C34B0">
with the report of an intended in&s;urrection of the <HI>Indians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Indian alarm, &amp;c.</NOTE> to cut off all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on a certain appointed day. This was communicated by two <HI>Indian</HI> women of <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> to an old <HI>Dutch</HI> in|habitant, near <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> to be on the next fourth day of the week. Several <HI>Friends</HI> or <HI>Quakers,</HI> upon hearing this report, being con&s;cious of their ju&s;t conduct towards the <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;en&s;ible of nothing that could rea&s;onably di&s;gu&s;t them, endea|voured to appea&s;e the people's fears. The &s;aid fourth day being come, about ten o'clock, in the night, a me&s;&s;enger arrived at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> out of the woods, and told the people, that three families, about nine miles di&s;tant, which he named, were all cut off by the <HI>Indians.</HI>&mdash;This report coming to a <HI>Friend,</HI> then at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> about midnight he took with him two young men, on hor&s;eback, to the place, in order to examine into the truth of the affair.&mdash;They found the three hou&s;es, but no body in them, and yet no &s;igns of murder;&mdash;their inha|bitants, alarmed in a &s;imilar manner, had fled to the hou&s;es of their parents, at <HI>Ridley</HI> creek, about a mile from thence. The ma&s;ter of one of the&s;e families, being from home, had been informed five hundred <HI>Indians</HI> were actually collected at <HI>Naaman's</HI> creek, in pur&s;uit of their de&s;ign, to kill the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and as he was ha&s;tening to his hou&s;e, he thought he heard his boy crying out, and &s;aying, <HI>"What &s;hall I do, my Dame is killed!</HI> Upon which, in&s;tead of going home, to know the certainty of the affair, he ran off, to acquaint the government, at <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> but being met by a per&s;on of more prudence than him&s;elf, before he got to the city, he was per&s;waded by him to return.&mdash;</P>
<P>The report notwith&s;tanding &s;oon arrived at the city; and was told with &s;uch alarming circum|&s;tances, that a me&s;&s;enger was immediately di&s;|patched to <HI>Marcus Hook,</HI> near the &s;aid <HI>Naaman's</HI> creek to enquire the truth of it. He quickly re|turned

The&s;e circum&s;tances rendered the affair &s;till more alarming, and, with many, amounted to a certainty.</P>
<P>The Council were, at that time, &s;itting at <HI>Phi|ladelphia</HI> on other affairs, when one of them, a <HI>Friend,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b Pu&s;ey</HI> came from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> with his family, in 1682; and from that time till his death, near 45 years, was a very u&s;e|ful and valuable member of &s;ociety, both religious and civil.

He lived in <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> county; and died in the Twelfth month, 1725, in the 76th. year of his age.</NOTE> who lived in <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> county, voluntarily offered him&s;elf to go to the place, provided they would name five others to accompany him, without weapons; which being &s;oon agreed on, they rode to the place; but, in|&s;tead of meeting with five hundred warriors, they found the <HI>old king</HI> quietly lying, with his lame foot along on the ground, and his head, at ea&s;e, on a kind of pillow, the women at work, in the field, and the children playing together.&mdash;</P>
<P>When they had entered the <HI>wigwam,</HI> the king pre&s;ently a&s;ked them very mildly, <HI>"What they all came for?"</HI> They told him the report, which the <HI>Indian</HI> women had rai&s;ed; and a&s;ked him, whether the <HI>Indians</HI> had any thing again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h?</HI> He appeared much di&s;plea&s;ed at the report and &s;aid, "The women ought to be burnt to death; and that they had nothing again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h;"</HI>&mdash;ad|ding, "'Tis true there are about fifteen pounds yet

<P>One of the company further expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the <HI>Indian</HI> king, in the following manner; "That the great God, who made the world, and all things therein, con&s;equently made all mankind, both Indians and Engli&s;h; and as he made all, &s;o his love was extended to all; which, was plainly &s;hewn, by his cau&s;ing the <HI>rain</HI> and <HI>dews</HI> to fall on the ground of both <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> alike; that it might equally produce what the <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;owed or planted in it, for the &s;u&s;tenance of life; and al&s;o by his making the &s;un to &s;hine equally on all, both <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to nouri&s;h them; and that &s;eeing the great <HI>Being,</HI> which made them all, extended his love thus to all, &s;o they were mutually bound to love one another."&mdash;</P>
<P>The king an&s;wered, "What they had &s;aid was true; and as God has given you corn, I would ad|vi&s;e you to get it in; (it being then harve&s;t time) for we intend you no harm."&mdash;They parted ami|cably; and the me&s;&s;engers, returning, put an end to the people's fears.</P>

But, pray, con&s;ider how little I am in fault; and how ill I am rewarded by &s;ome in that Province.&mdash;I left it quiet, and the government in the council. <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> grew weary of this form; writ, and got others to write, to change it to a deputy&s;hip; I &s;ent to know, if he would have it; in the meanwhile writ to me, he would not meddle, and de&s;ired a <HI>quietus,</HI> or di&s;mi&s;s:&mdash;Upon this captain <HI>Blackwell's</HI> wife, general <HI>Lambert's</HI> daughter, coming to me about pre|&s;enting &s;omething of her hu&s;band's to the <HI>King;</HI> and remembering him to be a man of &s;obriety and parts, a&s;ked for him, then in <HI>New England;</HI> and if he would accept of the government of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;This di&s;plea&s;ed:&mdash;I altered and left it to them, to chu&s;e either the government of the council, or five commi&s;&s;ioners, or a deputy: What could be ten|derer? Now I perceive <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> is cho&s;en by the three upper, but not the three lower counties; and &s;its down with this broken choice: This has grieved and wounded me and mine, I fear to the hazard of all! What|ever the morals of the lower counties are, it was embraced as a mercy, that we got and united them to the province; and a great charter ties them; and this particular ambition has broken it; for the &s;triving can ari&s;e from nothing el&s;e; and what is that &s;pirit that would &s;ooner divide the child, than let things run in their own channel, but that which &s;acrifices all bowels to wilfulne&s;s! Had they learned what this means, <HI>I will have mercy, and not &s;acrifice,</HI> there had been no breaches nor animo&s;ities there till I had come, at lea&s;t. I de&s;ire thee to write to them; which they will mind now more, than upon the &s;pot; and lay their union upon them; for el&s;e the Governor of <HI>New York</HI> is like to have all; if he has it not already. The Lord forgive them their un&s;peakable injury to me and mine. I have &s;ent, nine months ago, to <HI>J. Good&s;on</HI> a commi&s;&s;ion, if my letter prevails not, that was to unite them, that <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> be Gover|nor above, and captain <HI>Markham,</HI> below, under &s;uch and &s;uch re&s;tric|tions, &amp;c &mdash;but hear not a word of this. I was going the Second-month at farthe&s;t, all things preparing, as friends of <HI>London</HI> know, when this trouble broke out upon me, in the Eleventh: and &s;uch have been my hard|&s;hips, could not get clear without &s;nares, &amp;c. &s;o, wait God's time, who has a hand in all this; and, I believe, in the end, every way, for good; &s;o, in true love to thee and thine, and earne&s;t de&s;ires to &s;ee their faces, I conclude</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the year 1691, an affair happened among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in this part of the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;chi&s;m of George Keith, &amp;c.</NOTE> which gave them much unea&s;ine&s;s and trouble, in their religi|ous capacity, more e&s;pecially in this Province, and the neighbouring places. This was the difference and &s;eparation between them and <HI>George Keith,</HI> before mentioned. He had been an eminent preacher and writer among them, for many years; and had publi&s;hed &s;everal well-written treati&s;es, in defence of their religious principles, yet extant. He was a man of quick natural parts, and con&s;i|derable literary abilities; acute in argument, and very ready and able in logical di&s;putations, and nice di&s;tinctions, on theological &s;ubjects; but, &s;aid to be, of a brittle temper, and over-bearing di&s;po|&s;ition of mind; not &s;ufficiently tempered and qua|lified with that Chri&s;tian moderation and charity, which give command over the human pa&s;&s;ions; the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of true Chri&s;tianity: of which he him&s;elf had not only made high pro|fe&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o, in his younger years, as appears
<PB N="364" REF="032729_0364_0FF4F3BAEC6E38C8">
by his writings, had a good under&s;tanding. His great confidence in his own &s;uperior abilities &s;eems to have been one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Keith's &s;chi&s;m, &amp;c.</NOTE> if not the chief, introductory cau&s;e of this unhappy di&s;pute;&mdash;When men &s;et too high a value on them&s;elves, and others will not come up to their price, then they are di&s;contented. He is &s;aid to have had too much life in argument and di&s;putation, on religious points of controver&s;y, and &s;ometimes to have exhibited an unbecoming vanity on victory thereby obtained over his oppo|nents, even, prior to the &s;chi&s;m between him and his friends: for having, &s;ome time before, been on a vi&s;it to <HI>New England,</HI> he is repre&s;ented as having indulged his natural propen&s;ity this way, among the preachers and inhabitants there, in a very ex|travagant manner: Which di&s;po&s;ition of mind, from that time forward, appeared to have &s;o far got the a&s;cendancy over him, that, on his return, he began to exhibit the &s;ame, even, among his friends, beginning with finding fault, propo&s;ing and urging new regulations, in the &s;ociety, in re|&s;pect to the di&s;cipline of it, and complaining, <HI>"There was too great a &s;lackne&s;s therein."</HI>&mdash;Upon his friends not readily joining with him and his propo&s;als, in the manner he expected, he became &s;till more captious, and more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;eek mat|ters of reproach and offence again&s;t divers in the &s;o|ciety, and to make the wor&s;t of them; charging &s;ome of his friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His allega|tion again&s;t the Quakers</NOTE> who were generally well e&s;|teemed and approved mini&s;ters, with preaching fal&s;e doctrine; and, it is &s;aid, even, in points con|trary to what him&s;elf had formerly held and de|clared, in his writings, in defence of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and their principles. He found fault with his friends being in the magi&s;tracy, and their execut|ing the penal laws again&s;t malefactors, as being in|con&s;i&s;tent with their religious profe&s;&s;ion; and, in &s;hort, contended that he and &s;uch as joined with him, were the true <HI>Quakers,</HI> and all the re&s;t, who oppo&s;ed him, were apo&s;tates.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="032729_0365_0FF4F4FC6642EC00">The&s;e were the principal allegations, which, in beginning of the di&s;pute, he appears to have made again&s;t the <HI>Quakers.</HI> The principal things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their charges a|gain&s;t him.</NOTE> if not the whole, with which I find him charged by them, at that time, appear to be his over-bear|ing temper, and unchri&s;tian di&s;po&s;ition of mind, in gro&s;sly vilifying and di&s;paraging divers members of the &s;ociety, who were univer&s;ally and highly approved among them, and entirely rejecting their advice and judgment, in the affair; the con&s;e|quence of an overheated and intemperate zeal: which, at la&s;t, proceeded &s;o far as to occa&s;ion &s;uch a breach, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is di&s;|owned, &amp;c. in 1692.</NOTE> on the 20th. day of the Fourth-month, 1692, <HI>a declaration, or te&s;timony of denial,</HI> was drawn up again&s;t him, at a meeting of the mini&s;ters of the &s;ociety at <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> wherein both he and his conduct were publicly di&s;owned by them.</P>

<P>IN tender love, and with &s;pirits bowed down before the Lord, is this our &s;alutation unto you; earne&s;tly de&s;iring your growth, and daily pre&s;ervation, in the ancient truth, and in the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and our hope and breathings are, that no in&s;inu|ations, or wiles, of the enemy &s;hall prevail, to turn you a&s;ide from your &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s, or cau&s;e you to e&s;teem lightly of the rock and way of God's &s;alvation unto you, but that you may be kept in the light and life, which was, and is, the ju&s;t man's path, to the end of our days, Amen!</P>
<P>Now, dear Friends, it is with &s;orrow of &s;pirits and grief of &s;ouls, that we &s;ignify unto you the tedious exerci&s;e, and vexatious perplexity, we have met with, in our late friend, <HI>George Keith,</HI> for &s;everal months pa&s;t. With mourning and lamentation do we &s;ay, How is this mighty man fallen! How is his &s;hield ca&s;t away, as though he had not known the oil of the holy Ointment! How &s;hall it be told in <HI>Gath,</HI> and publi&s;h|ed in the &s;treets of <HI>A&s;kalon!</HI> Will not the daughters of the uncircumci&s;ed triumph, when they hear that he is fallen upon the &s;oaring mountains, and from the high places of <HI>I&s;rael?</HI> While thou walked&s;t in the coun&s;el of God, and wert little in thy own eyes, thy bow did abide in &s;trength; thy &s;word returned not empty from the fat of the enemies of God&mdash;thy bow returned not back. His enemies were then vile unto thee&punc; and his followers honourable in thy e&s;teem. Oh, how lovely wert thou, in that day, when his beauty was upon thee; and when his comeline&s;s covered thee! Why &s;hould his ornaments exalt thee, which were given to hum|ble thee before him? And how art thou fallen from thy <HI>fir&s;t love,</HI> and art become <HI>treacherous to the &s;pou&s;e of thy youth.</HI> Con&s;ider where thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy <HI>fir&s;t works</HI></P>
<P>But &s;o it hath happened, Friends, le&s;t any fle&s;h &s;hould glory, but become &s;ilent before the Lord, that this <HI>once eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and <HI>in&s;trument of renown,</HI> in the hand of the Lord, while he kept his fir&s;t habitation, and knew the government of Truth over his own &s;pirit; and witne&s;&s;ed the &s;ame to be a bridle to his tongue, was then &s;erviceable, both in pen and &s;peech, to the churches of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> But now, and of late, it is too obvious and apparent, that being degenerated from the lowly, meek and peaceable &s;pirit of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> and grown cool in charity and love towards his brethren, he is gone into a &s;pirit of enmity, wrath, and &s;elf-exalta|tion, contention and janglings; and, as a per&s;on without the fear of God before his eyes, and without regard to his Chri&s;tian brethren, and letting loo&s;e to an extravagant tongue, he hath broken out into many ungodly &s;peeches, rai&s;ing accu&s;ations, and pa&s;&s;ionate threatenings towards many of his brethren and elders; and that upon &s;lender occa&s;ions. And when &s;ome in Chri&s;tian duty, have laid before him his un&s;avory words, and abu&s;ive language, as a per&s;on of common civility would loath, it hath been too frequent with him, and that, in a tran&s;port of heat and pa&s;&s;ion, to call &s;ome of his brethren, in the mini&s;try, and other elders, and that upon &s;mall provocations, (if any) <HI>Fools, ignorant Heathens, Infidels, &s;illy Souls, Lyers, Heretics, rotten Ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, Muggl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tonians,</HI> and other names of that infamous &s;train; thereby to our grief, foaming out his own &s;hame. And further, his anger and envy being cruel again&s;t us, and not content|ing him&s;elf with his har&s;hne&s;s again&s;t per&s;ons, he proceeded, in bitter|ne&s;s of &s;pirit, to charge our meetings with being come together to cloak here&s;y and deceit; and publi&s;hing openly &s;everal times, that there were more doctrines of devils, and damnable here&s;ies, among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> than in any profe&s;&s;ion among the Prote&s;tants. He hath long objected again&s;t our <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> even, &s;oon after his coming among us, and having prepared a draught of his own, and the &s;ame not finding the expected reception, he &s;eemed di&s;gu&s;ted. Since he hath often quarrelled with us about <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> declaring, <HI>"That he knew none given forth by the body of Friends, to his &s;atisfaction;"</HI> and often charged mo&s;t of us with being un|&s;ound in the faith. We have offered, in &s;everal meetings, for his &s;atis|faction, and to prevent &s;trife among us, and for pre&s;erving the peace of the church, to deliver a <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of our Chri&s;tian faith, in the words of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the Author of our Chri&s;tian faith, and in the words of the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples, his faithful followers; or we would concur, and agree upon a <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and have it tran&s;mitted for approbation of the Yearly Meeting here, or the Yearly Meeting in <HI>London;</HI> yet, it was offered unto him, at the &s;ame time, that a <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> concerning the main matters of controver&s;y, &s;hould be given out of a book of his own; but all was &s;lighted, as in&s;ufficient. The Lord knows the trouble, which we have had with this unruly member; and the open|ne&s;s of our hearts, and well-wi&s;hes towards him, notwith&s;tanding his rage and violence again&s;t us; and of the endeavours of many in this place, to have gained upon him by a friendly conver&s;e, and by other means, not incon&s;iderable to a brotherly freedom; but our labour hitherto &s;eems to be as water &s;pilt upon a rock. And this meeting, having orderly and tenderly dealt with him, for his abu&s;ive language, and di&s;orderly behaviour, he hath not only &s;lighted all applications of gaining him to a &s;en&s;e of his ill-treatment and mi&s;carriages, but, in an in&s;ulting manner, &s;aid to the friends appointed by the meeting, to admoni&s;h him, <HI>"That be trampled the judgment of the Meeting under his feet, as dirt."</HI> And hath, of late, &s;et up a &s;eparate meeting here; where he hath, like an open oppo&s;er, not only reviled &s;everal friends, by expo&s;ing their religious re|putations, in mixt auditories of &s;ome hundreds, endeavouring to render them and friends here, by the pre&s;s and otherwi&s;e, a &s;corn to the profane, and the &s;ong of the drunkard; but he hath traduced and vilified our wor|thy travelling friends, <HI>James Dickin&s;on</HI> and <HI>Thomas Wil&s;on,</HI> in their pow|erful and &s;avory <HI>mini&s;try,</HI> who&s;e &s;ervice is not only here, but, in mo&s;t meetings in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> well known to have a &s;eal in the hearts of many thou&s;ands of the <HI>I&s;rael of God.</HI> He hath al&s;o within a few weeks, appeared in oppo&s;ition, as it were, to the body of Friends, by putting on his hat, when our well-received and recommended friend, <HI>James Dickin&s;on,</HI> was at prayer; and that, in a meeting of near a thou&s;and Friends and others; and &s;o going out of the meeting, to the great di&s;quiet thereof, and to the drawing &s;ome &s;cores into the &s;ame oppo&s;ition with him, by his ill example. And he thus per&s;i&s;ting in his repeated oppo&s;i|tion, hard &s;peeches, and continued &s;eparation, and labouring like an un|wearyed adver&s;ary, to widen the breach, made by him, and &s;o, abu&s;ing &s;ome of the neighbouring meetings, by being, as yet, under that cover|ing of being owned by us; we are hereby brought under a religious con|&s;traint, and to prevent other meetings from being further injured by him, to give forth this <HI>Te&s;timony,</HI> &s;trained, as it were, from us, by his many and violent provocations, <HI>viz.</HI> That we cannot own him, in &s;uch ungodly &s;peeches, and di&s;orderly behaviour, or, in his &s;eparate meetings; and that we di&s;own the &s;ame, as proceeding from a wrong &s;pirit, which brings into di&s;order inwardly, and leads into di&s;traction and confu&s;ion outwardly. And, until he condemn and decline the &s;ame, we cannot receive him, in his public mini&s;try, and would have him cea&s;e to offer his gift, as &s;uch, among us, or el&s;ewhere among Friends, till he be reconciled to his offend|ed brethren. And as tho&s;e few of our brethren, in the gift of the mini|&s;try, who are gone out with <HI>George Keith,</HI> into his uncharitable and divid|ing &s;pirit, (the mi&s;erable effects whereof many of us have &s;ufficiently known, in <HI>Old England,</HI> and other parts) our judgment is, that, while they continue &s;uch, they become unqualified to the work of the Go&s;pel, as degenerating from the guidance of God's ble&s;&s;ed and peaceable &s;pirit; in their hearts, (from whence proceeds the effectual New Te&s;tament mi|ni&s;try) and being turned from the peaceable fruits thereof, are gone to un-charity and contention.</P>
<P>And now, all you, who have walked in fellow&s;hip and communion with us, and are drawn a&s;ide, through incon&s;ideration, or otherwi&s;e, into the &s;pirit of &s;eparation and prejudice again&s;t our meetings, orderly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; and wherein we have often been mutually refre&s;hed together; we cannot but, in the fear of God, and in love to your &s;ouls, admoni&s;h you al&s;o of the in&s;ecurity of your pre&s;ent &s;tate, and that, therein we cannot have unity with you; and unle&s;s you return from under that &s;pirit, dry|ne&s;s and barrenne&s;s from the Lord, will be your reward.</P>
<P>And &s;o, dear Friends, we exhort you all to behave your &s;elves, in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, and pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eable truth, upon all occa&s;ions, but more e&s;pecially upon any di&s;cour&s;e, or conference, with any of them, who are di&s;contented among you, or &s;tarted a&s;ide from you; and avoid all heats and contentions in matters of faith and wor&s;hip; and let not the &s;alt of the covenant be wanting in your words and actions; for, thereby the favour of your conver&s;ation will reach the witne&s;s of God in them. The Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t be with you all, Amen.</P>

By them and this know, that it hath plea&s;ed God to work my enlargement, by three Lords repre&s;ent|ing my ca&s;e, as not only hard, but oppre&s;&s;ive; that there was nothing again&s;t me, but what impo&s;tors, or tho&s;e that are fled, or that have, &s;ince their pardon, refu&s;ed to verify, (and a&s;ked me pardon, for &s;aying what they did) alledged again&s;t me; that they had long known me, &s;ome of them thirty years, and had never known me to do an ill thing, but many good offices; and, that, for not being thought to go abroad in defiance to the government, I might and would have done it, two years ago; and, that I was, therefore, willing to wait to go about my affairs, as before, with leave; that I might be the better re&s;pected, in the liberty I took to follow it.</P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI> an&s;wered, "That I was his old acquaintance, as well as theirs; and, that I might follow my bu&s;ine&s;s as freely as ever; and that he had nothing to &s;ay to me."&mdash;Upon which they pre&s;&s;ed him to command one of them, to declare the &s;ame to the Secretary of State, Sir <HI>John Trenchard,</HI> that if I came to him, or otherwi&s;e, he might &s;ignify the &s;ame to me;&mdash;which he al&s;o did: &mdash;The Lords were <HI>Roche&s;ter, Ra|nelagh,</HI> and <HI>Sidney;</HI> and the la&s;t, as my greate&s;t acquaintance, was to tell the Secretary; accordingly he did; and the Secretary, after &s;peaking him&s;elf, and having it from King <HI>William</HI>'s own mouth, appointed me a time to meet him at home; and did, with the <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and told me, I was as free as ever; and, as he doubted not my prudence about my quiet living, &s;o he a&s;&s;ured me, I &s;hould not be mole&s;ted, or in|jured in any of my affairs, at lea&s;t while he held that po&s;t. The Secre|tary is my old friend, and one I &s;erved, after the D of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and Lord Ru&s;&s;el's bu&s;ine&s;s: I carried him in my coach to Wind&s;or, and pre|&s;ented him to <HI>King James;</HI> and when the revolution came, he bought my four hor&s;es, that carried us. It was about three or four months before the revolution. The lords &s;poke the 23th of November, and he di&s;char|ged me on the 30th.</P>
<P>From the Secretary I went to our meeting, at the <HI>Bull and Mouth;</HI> thence to vi&s;it the &s;anctuary of my &s;olitude; and after that, to &s;ee my poor wife and children; my elde&s;t being with me all this while. My wife is yet weakly; but I am not without hopes of her recovery; who is of the be&s;t of wives and women.</P>
<P>From all this you may apprehend that I may yet &s;ee <HI>America,</HI> and &s;hall certainly judge things, as I find them: for I have had hard mea&s;ure among you; the province di&s;graced, and all our intere&s;t wounded: though I am tender and merciful, I am ju&s;t; and neither my relations in blood, nor in judgment, I hope, &s;hall be able to byas me into a wrong &s;en&s;e, or apprehen&s;ion: and I hope once more to unite you upon a common bot|tom:&mdash;Thus far of my enlargement, which, from a multitude of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, at this time, I &s;end in another hand; I was al&s;o &s;urprized at the &s;hort notice given me to write in.&mdash;The trial of <HI>George Keith</HI> has been in|du&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread all about the nation, e&s;pecially at <HI>London,</HI> at the <HI>Court, We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,</HI> and the <HI>Parliament Hou&s;e;</HI> the odium, it has contracted in &s;ome, &s;tirred up in others; the advantage, the di&s;affected among us make by it, again&s;t unity, again&s;t Friends' having power, again&s;t me an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you, in particular, are great and lamentable; the Lord put a holy &s;top, by his wi&s;e power, to this evil work, and bring that which is &s;o wrong, under his righteous judgment.&mdash;That you have a regard to my right, I cannot but value; and hope it is that, and not humour, or di&s;|appointment, that engaged you to decline; Oh, the &s;orrowful conclu&s;ion of eight or nine years' government! but I hope &s;oon to &s;ee an end of all this, if the Lord will; &s;o, not willing to lo&s;e this opportunity, and e&s;pe|cially upon this occa&s;ion, I &s;alute you all in the unchangeable truth of our God, de&s;iring your pre&s;ervation, in that which is more valuable than all the world, to them that love it, and ta&s;te the virtue of it."&mdash;"Friends generally well; the war continues; great lo&s;&s;es; poverty looking men in the face; and &s;carcety of bread al&s;o coming on apace; but <HI>Ireland</HI> helps, where it is at 2&shilling;3 and half-a-crown the bu&s;hel wheat; this is your harve&s;t; I de&s;ire my love to Friends and your families; and the Lord pre&s;erve you in his fear; and what you can, make up your breaches; my love &s;alutes you, and bids you, heartily, farewell.</P>

<P>WE, the &s;aid people, do &s;olemnly and &s;incerely declare, That it hath been our judgment and principle, from the fir&s;t day we were called to profe&s;s the light of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> manife&s;ted in our con&s;ciences, unto this day, that the &s;etting up and putting down kings and governments is God's peculiar prerogative, for cau&s;es be&s;t known to him&s;elf; and that it is not our work, or bu&s;ine&s;s, to have any hand, or contrivance therein, nor to be bu&s;y-bodies, in matters above our &s;tation; much le&s;s to plot, or con|trive the ruin, or overturn, of any of them: But to pray for the king, and for the &s;afety of our nation, and good of all men, that we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty, under the govern|ment, which he is plea&s;ed to &s;et over us.</P>
<P>And, according to this our <HI>ancient and innocent principle,</HI> we have of|ten given forth our te&s;timony, and now do, again&s;t all plotting, con&s;pi|racies, and contriving in&s;urrections again&s;t the King, or the government, and again&s;t all treacherous, barbarous and murderous de&s;igns what&s;oever, as works of the devil and darkne&s;s; and we &s;incerely ble&s;s God, and are heartily thankful to the king and government, for the liberty and privi|leges we enjoy under them, by law, e&s;teeming it our duty to be true and faithful to them.</P>
<P><HI>And whereas,</HI> we, the &s;aid people, are required to &s;ign the &s;aid a&s;|&s;ociation, we &s;incerely declare, that our refu&s;ing &s;o to do, is not out of any di&s;affection to the King, or Government, nor in oppo&s;ition to his being declared rightful and lawful King of the&s;e realms, but purely be|cau&s;e we cannot, for con&s;cience' &s;ake, &s;ight, kill, or revenge, either for our&s;elves, or any man el&s;e.</P>
<P>And we believe that the timely di&s;covery and prevention of the late barbarous de&s;ign and mi&s;chievous plot again&s;t the King and Govern|ment, and the &s;ad effects it might have had, is an eminent mercy from Almighty God; for which we, and the whole nation, have great cau&s;e to be humbly thankful to him, and to pray for the continuance of his mer|cies to them and us.</P>

<P>The Proprietary further enquired into the affair and both heard and an&s;wered all their rea&s;ons and objections; and then told them, "That he took this their conduct very unkind, even to him&s;elf in particular."</P>
<P>Upon which <HI>Ja&s;per Yeates,</HI> in behalf of the re&s;t, endeavoured to excu&s;e, or further explain, their behaviour, in this action, by declaring their great affection and regard for the Proprietary, but, that they mu&s;t be true to tho&s;e, whom they repre|&s;ented.&mdash;</P>

<P>The territory members objected, that they were great &s;ufferers by that act of union, however it was, at fir&s;t, intended; and could not &s;upport the burden of the charge.</P>
<P>The Proprietary replied, "They were free to break off, and might act di&s;tinctly by them&s;elves;" at which they &s;eemed plea&s;ed, and expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction; "But then," continued the Proprietary, "it mu&s;t be upon amicable terms, and a good un|der&s;tanding;&mdash;That they mu&s;t fir&s;t <HI>re&s;olve</HI> to &s;ettle the laws;&mdash;and that, as the intere&s;t of the <HI>province,</HI> and that of tho&s;e <HI>lower counties</HI> would be in&s;epara|bly the &s;ame, they &s;hould both u&s;e a conduct con|&s;i&s;tent with that relation," &amp;c.</P>

Soon after this, or, on the 18th. of the Fir&s;t-month, 1701-2, King <HI>William</HI> died; and the Prince&s;s <HI>Anne,</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> &s;ucceeding to the throne, commenced her reign with moderation and clemency.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn in favor at Court, &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>William Penn,</HI> being in the Queen's favour, was often at court; and for his conveniency, on that account, he took lodgings at <HI>Ken&s;ington;</HI> where, at his lei&s;ure hours, he writ &s;everal u&s;eful and ex|cellent treati&s;es, on divers &s;ubjects; for the in&s;truc|tion and benefit of po&s;terity; which may be &s;een in his works.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Hamilton's admini&s;tra|tion and death.</NOTE>Governor <HI>Hamilton's</HI> admini&s;tration, in <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania,</HI> after the Proprietary's departure, continued only till the Twelfth-month in the next following year, 1702, when he died: The principal part of which was taken up in endeavouring an union be|tween the province and territories, in legi&s;lation; re&s;pecting which the Proprietary, by his pre&s;ence and authority, had prevailed on them to a pre&s;ent compliance: For they had not yet accepted the new charter; and they had three years allowed them to &s;ignify their refu&s;al. For this purpo&s;e <HI>Hamilton</HI> laboured much with them, and u&s;ed many arguments to induce them to unite, but without &s;ucce&s;s.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>GOVERNOR EVANS appears to have been an active young man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1705.</NOTE> of a temper &s;carcely indiffe|rent to any thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gov. Evans did not at|tend &s;uffici|ently to the di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple, &amp;c.</NOTE> zealous to promote what he thought the &s;ervice and intere&s;t of the Proprietary required, but not &s;ufficiently &s;tudying the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of the people, over whom he pre&s;ided. His warm zeal to pu&s;h his own views, in &s;ome things, contrary to tho&s;e of the A&s;&s;embly, tended to pro|duce &s;uch extreme oppo&s;ition and di&s;like between them, as were &s;carcely warrantable, and might have had fatal effects; the natural con&s;equence of men's tempers being too much agitated and inflam|ed; be&s;ides the liberties of his private life and con|duct are repre&s;ented to have been &s;uch as rendered him offen&s;ive to a &s;ober and religious people. He

was moreover &s;aid to want neither ingenuity nor abilities, &s;o much as a proper application of them; for which years and experience are &s;o generally re|qui&s;ite. But his di&s;appointment, on his fir&s;t arri|val, in not being able to prevail on the A&s;&s;embly of the province to admit of a re-union with that of the territories, which he had &s;o much &s;et his mind upon, with the nature of certain following pro|ceedings of the former, appear to have occa&s;ioned his imprudently joining with the A&s;&s;embly of the latter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He joins with the A&s;&s;embly of the territo|ries to in|commode the Pro|vince.</NOTE> in &s;ome acts, which &s;eemed more calculated to incommode the province, than for any real uti|lity to either; from which kind of conduct it could not be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed any good under&s;tanding could ari&s;e, or be long cheri&s;hed, between them.</P>
<P>The Governor had endeavoured to form a militia through the government, but &s;o far as appears, and which could not be rea&s;onably expected other|wi&s;e, not with much &s;ucce&s;s. He knew the <HI>Qua|kers'</HI> principles were again&s;t bearing arms and war, yet, as the inexperience and a&s;&s;uming of youth, as well as the prejudice of more advanced years, is &s;ometimes ready to regard a contrariety of &s;enti|ment, in others, more e&s;pecially if it differ much from the common opinion, in the highe&s;t point of ab&s;urdity, without duly examining into the merits of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He treats the Quakers principles again&s;t war, as ab&s;urd.</NOTE> &s;o Governor <HI>Evans,</HI> by part of his conduct, appears to have regarded and treated the principles of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in re&s;pect to <HI>&s;elf defence,</HI> as a mere notion, which would never endure a &s;erious trial; and by the following imprudent &s;cheme and experiment, in&s;tead of an&s;wering any u&s;eful inten|tion to the public, he is &s;aid not only to have alien|ated the <HI>Quakers</HI> further from him, but al&s;o high|ly di&s;gu&s;ted &s;uch of the people in general, as were not concerned in the contrivance, or execution of it.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Evans,</HI> in conjunction with <HI>Robert French</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle, Thomas Clark,</HI> an attorney at

<P>It was at the time of the fair in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on the 16th. day of the Third-month, O. S. 1706, when this plot was put in execution; <HI>French</HI> acted at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> by &s;ending up a me&s;&s;enger to the go|vernor, at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in the greate&s;t ha&s;te, and apparent con&s;ternation, to acquaint him, that a number of ve&s;&s;els were then actually in the river, and as high up as a place, which he named. Up|on this news immediately the Governor acted his part; and, by his emi&s;&s;aries, made it fly through the city; while him&s;elf with a drawn &s;word in his hand, on hor&s;eback, rode through the &s;treets, in &s;eeming great commotion, and a behaviour adapted to the nature of the occa&s;ion, commanded and entreated people of all ranks to be properly a&s;&s;i&s;ting on the emergency, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There were two noted <HI>fal&s;e alarms</HI> formerly, in the province.

<P>But the de&s;ign, it is &s;aid, was &s;u&s;pected, or un|der&s;tood, by the more con&s;iderate part of the peo|ple, even at the beginning; and endeavours accord|ingly were u&s;ed, to prevent its taking effect; but the conduct and artifice of the Governor, with the help of his numerous a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and the ea&s;y cre|dulity, common to the more incon&s;iderate part of mankind, very much fru&s;trated the&s;e endeavours, till the fir&s;t tran&s;port of amazement had &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P><HI>James Logan,</HI> the Secretary, though he was one of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> was accu&s;ed or &s;u&s;pect|ed, of being privy to the affair. He denied the
<PB N="471" REF="032729_0471_0FF4F520474C0AC0">
charge; but endeavoured to palliate the action, and excu&s;e the Governor; which rendered him the more &s;u&s;pected. The de&s;ign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the fal&s;e alarm, &amp;c.</NOTE> though it had &s;uch a con&s;iderable effect, turned out entirely contrary to the expectation of the authors and promoters of it; for the people were &s;oon undeceived; and when they &s;aw how gro&s;sly they had been impo&s;ed upon, many of them &s;o highly re&s;ented the u&s;age, that the authors and promoters thereof were now obliged to con&s;ult their own &s;afety from the fury of an en|raged populace.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> it is &s;aid the principal part of them were attending their religious meeting as u&s;ual, on that day of the week, even in the mid&s;t of the confu&s;ion; and, as if they were aware of the de&s;ign, in general, behaved them&s;elves &s;o far con|&s;i&s;tently, that only four per&s;ons, who had any pre|tence to be accounted of that &s;ociety, appeared un|der arms, at the place of rendezvous, appointed on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>With this action, whereby the Governor render|ed him&s;elf odious to the generality of the inhabi|tants of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> may be mentioned the follow|ing; by which he incurred, in a particular manner, the di&s;plea&s;ure of the trading part of the province.</P>
<P>Soon after the A&s;&s;embly of the territories had met in legi&s;lation, independent of the province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the fort and exac|tions at Newca&s;tle, &amp;c.</NOTE> Governor <HI>Evans</HI> propo&s;ed to them the building a fort at <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> upon which a law was pa&s;&s;ed there, entitled, <HI>"An act for erecting and maintain|ing a fort, for her Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, at the town of Newca&s;tle upon Delaware."</HI> This law impo&s;ed a duty of half a pound of <HI>Gun-powder,</HI> for every ton, that all ve&s;&s;els whatever, coming from the &s;ea up the river, &s;hould mea&s;ure by the carpenters rule, who&s;e major part was not owned by per&s;ons re&s;id|ing on the river and bay of <HI>Delaware;</HI> (except &s;hips of war) and by it all ve&s;&s;els, both inward and outward, were obliged to &s;top, drop anchor, and
<PB N="472" REF="032729_0472_0FF4F5614EA19B00">
the commander to go on &s;hore, make report, and have leave to pa&s;s; from the commanding officer of the &s;aid fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the fort and exac|tions at Newca&s;tle, &amp;c.</NOTE> under penalty of paying five pounds, be&s;ides twenty &s;hillings for the fir&s;t gun, thirty for the &s;econd, and forty for every gun afterwards, that &s;hould be fired on the occa&s;ion, in ca&s;e of ne|glect, be&s;ides the forfeiture of five pounds, for contempt, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This law was con&s;idered as a manife&s;t infraction of the privileges granted by the royal charter to the &s;ettlers and inhabitants of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> and &s;till more &s;o, from the manner in which it was put in execution; for they had legally an undoubted right to the free u&s;e of the river and bay, without any interruption, ob&s;truction or impo&s;ition from any quarter whatever; and the violent means which con&s;equently became nece&s;&s;ary to enforce a law upon &s;uch a defective foundation, and not even counte|nanced by the law it&s;elf, &s;oon became a great nui|&s;ance, and an intolerable grievance to the trading part of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and others concerned in its commerce.&mdash;Be&s;ides, it was alledged, that the fort it&s;elf, as it was &s;ituated and circum&s;tanced, had it been under better management and more warrant|able direction, could not po&s;&s;ibly be much &s;ecurity to the river, nor protection to the ve&s;&s;els that might happen to be cha&s;ed, or a&s;&s;aulted in it.</P>
<P>The city of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> was much concerned at the&s;e proceedings, and the trading part thereof were highly incen&s;ed at this inva&s;ion of their ju&s;t liberties; accordingly endeavours were u&s;ed to have the affair properly redre&s;&s;ed, but without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Richard Hill,</HI> one of the Governor's Council, a bold man, and of con&s;iderable abilities and influence in the province, together with <HI>I&s;aac Norris</HI> and <HI>Samuel Pre&s;ton,</HI> all <HI>Quakers,</HI> and men of the fir&s;t rank and e&s;teem, was determined to try

He is &s;aid to have been endowed with good natural abilities; which he improved and applied to the benefit of mankind, as a man truly &s;en&s;ible that one of the chief ends of man's exi&s;tence is to be u&s;eful and beneficent to the human race; which he &s;hewed by his uniform conduct; and that to an&s;wer this end men are to be taken as they are, and their le&s;&s;er fail|ings to be endured, where they cannot be amended; the utility of his great talents was manife&s;ted by a prudent and con&s;i&s;tent conduct, in which he &s;o much the more effectually &s;ucceeded and excelled, and that agreeable to duty and a good con&s;cience, by con&s;tantly cheri&s;hing a temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, which overlooks or pa&s;&s;es by the many di&s;likes, de|ficiencies and ungrateful things, in others, which are &s;o commonly incident to mankind; &s;o that, by pre&s;erving through life, a chri&s;tian moderation, and an even hand, he was, on all occa&s;ions, qualified to u&s;e and exert his abilities to more advantage: His example in this was noble and con&s;pi|cuous, and his character, in mo&s;t re&s;pects, &s;o honourable among men, in general, and his conduct &s;o univer&s;ally beneficial, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of his own religious community, that he was an ornament to his country and profe&s;&s;ion, and his death a great lo&s;s to both; which was in the year 1735, when he was Chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P><P><HI>Samuel Pre&s;ton,</HI> likewi&s;e of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> was, for a long time, one of the Governor's Council, and Trea&s;urer of the province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> which offices he di&s;charged with much honor and fidelity. He was a man of great integrity to what he believed was his duty; his conduct in life, very in&s;tructive, and his practice a continual &s;eries of good offi|ces. He was a per&s;on of &s;uch remarkable benevolence, and open di&s;|po&s;ition of mind, as rendered advice and reproof, from him, the more acceptable and &s;erviceable; and being of a fair and clean character, good judgment, and &s;uitable pre&s;ence of mind, his u&s;efulne&s;s, in that capacity, was the more exten&s;ive and &s;ucce&s;sful. He was a very valuable mem|ber of &s;ociety, among his friends, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> undertaking and per|forming many difficult offices, and &s;ocial duties therein, with great chear|fulne&s;s, alacrity and utility; and was highly e&s;teemed by them, as an elder, who ruled well in his &s;ocial capacity, and was worthy of double honor.&mdash;He died in September, 1743 aged about eighty years.</P><P>The worth of wi&s;e and virtuous men is ine&s;timable, and their lo&s;s to the community, not ea&s;ily repaired.

<P>THAT a petition of above two hundred and twenty of the merchants and other inhabitants of the &s;aid province, but mo&s;tly of the city of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> having been pre&s;ented to this Hou&s;e, complaining of very great abu&s;es and oppre&s;&s;ions, which &s;ome of the inhabitants of the county of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> have committed upon &s;everal of the&s;e petitioners, by colour of a certain ordinance, or act of A&s;&s;embly, lately pa&s;&s;ed there by the &s;aid Lieutenant Governor, and Repre&s;entatives of the freemen of the &s;aid three lower counties, entitled <HI>"An act for erecting and maintaining a fort for her Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, at the town of Newca&s;tle upon Delaware;"</HI> which act, as al&s;o the &s;everal affidavits, relating to the matter complained of, being read, we thought proper, in the fir&s;t place, to con&s;ider the royal charter of the late King Charles the &s;econd, to the Proprietary, bearing date the fourth day of March, in the three and thirtieth year of his reign, whereby the free and undi&s;turbed u&s;e and continuance in, and pa&s;&s;age unto, and out of, all the ports, harbours, bays, waters, rivers, i&s;les and inlents, belonging unto, or leading to, or from this country, with the other powers and liberties, mentioned in the &s;aid petition, are granted to the Proprietary and inhabitants of this province, as the petitioners &s;et forth; and we further ob&s;erve, that by the &s;aid charter, the Queen's liege people of this province are to be &s;ubject to no laws, but &s;uch as are con&s;onant to rea&s;on, and as near as may be, agreeable to the laws, &s;tatutes and rights of the kingdom of England.</P>
<P>In the next place we have in&s;pected the late Duke of <HI>York's</HI> deeds of feoffment to the Proprietary, for the &s;aid three lower counties, as al&s;o the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd's grant to the Duke, for the &s;ame lands; and when we call to mind how the Repre&s;entatives of the lower counties broke off, and refu&s;ed to proceed legi&s;latively, in conjunction with the Repre&s;entatives of the province, under the Proprietary's admini&s;tration; but how far they can be ju&s;tified in making laws to rai&s;e money on the Queen's &s;ubjects in this government, we intend &s;hall be further con&s;idered hereafter; in the mean time we &s;hall in&s;i&s;t that the liberty of the free u&s;e, and pa&s;&s;age to, and out of, the ports of this province, granted us by the above recited royal charter, is well warranted by the laws of <HI>England;</HI> and that no impo&s;ition can, by any act, or ordinance, made at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> be laid upon any ve&s;&s;el, bound to, or from, any port in this province, which doth not unload at &s;ome key, or place, within the &s;aid lower counties; and we conceive, that upon a &s;trict examination of their &s;aid act of A&s;&s;embly, it will mo&s;t evidently appear, that the ve&s;&s;els not bound to, or out of, &s;ome port or place there, cannot legally be obliged to comply with the impo&s;itions of the &s;aid act.</P>
<P>Therefore this hou&s;e, having fully and maturely weighed the nature of the &s;aid act, and the u&s;e that is, and has been made of it, found them|&s;elves obliged, in duty to the Queen, and ju&s;tice to the people they re|pre&s;ent, to come to the following re&s;olutions, N. C. D.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it is the opinion of this Hou&s;e, that the laid act of A&s;&s;em|bly might be by the Governor, intended for the Queen's &s;ervice, and &s;ecu|rity of her &s;ubjects, yet the manner of putting the &s;ame in execution proves an apparent violation of the &s;aid royal charter, as well as the common and &s;tatute laws of <HI>England,</HI> and is de&s;tructive to trade, and tends to the depopulating and ruin of this province.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is the opinion of this Hou&s;e, that the firing of &s;hot at the &s;loop <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in the &s;everal affidavits mentioned, when &s;he was duly cleared, at this port of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as the acts of navigation direct, and had the Governor's <HI>Let-pa&s;s,</HI> and upon her voyage to <HI>Barba|does,</HI> is not warranted by the &s;aid act of A&s;&s;embly; but that tho&s;e, who fired at the &s;aid &s;loop, after they had notice what &s;he was, and how &s;he was cleared, ought to be pro&s;ecuted, as per&s;ons committing ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Queen's liege people.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That it is the opinion of this Hou&s;e, that, in ca&s;e the ma&s;ter of the &s;aid &s;loop had been liable to pay either <HI>Powder-money,</HI> or other <HI>mulets,</HI> impo&s;ed by the &s;aid act, yet the forcing him out of the ve&s;&s;el, and impri&s;oning him, when &s;ecurity was offered, for an&s;wering the &s;uppo&s;ed offence, is not warranted by the &s;aid act, but is mo&s;t illegal and arbitrary.</P>
<P>We, having thus pre&s;ented our opinion of the &s;aid act, entreat, that thou would&s;t u&s;e the mo&s;t effectual methods to put a &s;peedy &s;top to the &s;aid exorbitant practices, great abu&s;es and oppre&s;&s;ions, mentioned in the &s;aid petition (a copy whereof we humbly lay before thee;) and that the authors of the&s;e arbitrary actions and oppre&s;&s;ions complained of, may be pro&s;ecuted according to law, and be no longer permitted to abu&s;e the Queen's authority, and &s;tand in open defiance of her royal <HI>Uncle's</HI> grant, ob&s;truct our lawful commerce, and invade our liberties, rights and pro|perties, and under the pretence of fortifying the river, for the &s;ervice of the Queen, commit ho&s;tilities and depredations upon her liege people.</P>
