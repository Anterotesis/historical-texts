<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>POLEMICK Writers, or Books of Controver&s;y, e&s;pecially upon religious Subjects, are not in gene|ral agreeable to the prevaling Di&s;po&s;ition of the pre&s;ent Age: And it mu&s;t be acknowledged that an enquiring Mind is too often di&s;appointed in the Peru&s;al of &s;uch Works. It frequently happening that Per&s;ons who engage in di&s;putable Points are either bia&s;&s;ed by their Education, or el&s;e act from Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and in&s;tead of &s;incerely endeavouring to promote Truth in its Sim|plicity, they labor to maintain the Doctrines of a Party, or the Principles of their Education, which perhaps they have implicitly a&s;&s;ented to, and deem Founda|mentals in Religion, tho' they have never impartially examined into their Validity.</P>
<P>There are &s;carce any People who have been more fre|quently attacked than tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers;</HI> or who&s;e Principles have, thro' the Ignorance or Malevolence of their Adver&s;aries, been more gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented.&mdash; 'Tis not long &s;ince a Treati&s;e made its Appearance in this Part of the World under a <HI>&s;pecious Title,</HI> probably
<PB N="iv" REF="007983_0003_102DC8DC34537260">
with a View to obtain Readers or vend large Numbers of &s;o <HI>extraordinary a Performance.</HI>&mdash;The Author a&s;&s;erts that <HI>the</HI> Quaker <HI>Doctrine of Water Bapti&s;m is con&s;idered, their Objections an&s;wered, and the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England <HI>upon that impor|tant Point &s;tated and vindicated.</HI>&mdash;The following Sheets contain an An&s;wer to that Treati&s;e, which we recommend to the &s;erious Peru&s;al of every impartial and judicious Reader.</P>
<P>Our Antagoni&s;t pretends in his Preface that his only Motive for entering into the Enquiry was to obtain Satisfaction to him&s;elf upon the Doctrine of Water Bapti&s;m; and that he had no Thoughts of appearing in Print: From which, we &s;uppo&s;e, he would have us conclude that he was a &s;incere Seeker after Truth, and entered into the Enquiry free from Bias or Preju|dice: But whether he commenced his Enquiry upon this Bottom mu&s;t be left to his own Con&s;cience. Tho' if to mi&s;cite or mutilate the Quotations he brings from the Writings of tho&s;e whom he oppo&s;es, and to in&s;ert them as fair and genuine, be Evidences of the Contrary, our Opponent is, we think, highly culpable; and which we conceive will evidently appear on Peru&s;al of the en&s;uing Sheets.&mdash;Is it not hard to know what re|ligious Principles this Author is of? For, notwith|&s;tanding he affects to advocate for the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> does he not advance Doctrine contrary thereto, when he &s;ays, <HI>It, Water Bapti&s;m,</HI> is made one of the Conditions upon the Performance whereof eternal Sal|vation
<PB N="v" REF="007983_0004_102DC8DEC79033F8">
is to be obtained? Do not Prote&s;tants deny that Water Bapti&s;m is <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to Salva|tion, tho' Papi&s;ts &s;ay none can be &s;aved without it?</P>
<P>Our Adver&s;ary's Notion of Water Bapti&s;m &s;eems &s;omewhat like the Papi&s;ts Doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation: <HI>They &s;ay</HI> the Bread after Con&s;ecration is the real Body of Chri&s;t; <HI>He &s;ugge&s;ts</HI> that Water duly admini&s;tred wa&s;hes the mo&s;t inveterate and malignant Di&s;ea&s;es from the Soul. Is not this to make the Water &s;piritual, or to add &s;ome Virtue it had not before? It being evident that elementary Water cannot reach the Soul.</P>
<P>How lamentable is it that Men will not &s;tudy to be quiet and mind their own Bu&s;ine&s;s: Were they to act in their proper Sphere they might be of U&s;e to Man|kind. &mdash;And if Divinity or the right Knowledge of the &s;aving Truths of the Go&s;pel were to be attained by human Study, as the Laws of Nations are, our Op|ponent might probably have obtained the Character of <HI>Learned</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;e:</HI> But as he appears &s;o great a Stranger to the experimental Knowledge of the Nature, End and De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, it is no Wonder he has run into &s;o many and great Ab&s;urdities re&s;pecting the Doctrine of Water Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>The Author of this Reply is a plain Man, not practi&s;ed in the Art of Controver&s;y, nor inclined to Di&s;putation; but is diffident of his own Abilities and
<PB N="vi" REF="007983_0005_102DC90A396B2C48">
Qualifications for &s;uch Undertakings; and nothing &s;hort of an Apprehen&s;ion of Duty and good Will to Mankind was his Inducement to appear in Print. We think he has treated our Antagoni&s;t with Coolne&s;s and Moderation, and avoided unfair Deductions.&mdash;And if any Thing herein written &s;hould contribute towards informing the Ignorant or Unprejudiced, or tend to remove Stumbling-Blocks out of the Way of the Weak, the De&s;ign of the Author will in great Mea&s;ure be an&s;wered.</P>

<HEAD>AN ANSWER TO THE LAYMAN'S Treati&s;e on Bapti&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Author, here to be an&s;wered, intro|duces his Complaint, again&s;t <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> with a Perver&s;ion of his Words, in adding the Word <HI>[Utter]</HI> Strangers, in&s;tead of
<Q>how much Strangers to, and aver&s;e from, that true and acceptable Wor&s;hip that is performed in the Spirit of Truth.</Q></P>
<P>ROBERT BARCLAY, in his Apology, (Page 411) after he has mentioned &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions, of which our Opponent has taken Notice, in his fir&s;t Page, makes the following Remark:
<Q>Which Zeal, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if they would but &s;eriou&s;ly examine it, they would find to be but the Prejudice of Education, and the Love of Self more than that of God or his pure Wor&s;hip; this is verified concerning tho&s;e Things which are called Sacraments.</Q>
And then the Author, by another Perver&s;ion of his Words, &s;aith,
<Q>which are empty Shaddows, and mere out|&s;ide
<PB N="2" REF="007983_0007_102DC90FC24CCA78">
Things, and not commanded by Chri&s;t, nor any Way nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</Q>
All which I readily grant him, but would have him &s;peak the Truth, and render others Words as they are. <HI>See Apology, Page</HI> 411.</P>
<P>HE confe&s;&s;eth, that if what is here &s;aid of the Sa|craments be true, the Church of <HI>England</HI> falls very ju&s;tly under the Cen&s;ure before complained of. The Que&s;tion with me is not what Church or Society falls under that Cen&s;ure, but what is agreeable to Scrip|ture, Truth and &s;ound Rea&s;on in this important Point; and in Order to give a Rea&s;on to &s;uch as a&s;keth us of the Hope that is in us, in Meekne&s;s and Fear:
<Q>Fir&s;t we believe that there is but one Bapti&s;m, as well as but one Lord, one Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Apology, Page 413.</Q></P>
<P><Q>SECONDLY, that this one Bapti&s;m, which is the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, is not a Wa&s;hing with, or Dipping in Water, but a being bapti&s;ed with the Spirit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIRDLY, that the Bapti&s;m with <HI>elementary Water</HI> was but a Figure of the <HI>&s;piritual Bapti&s;m;</HI> and therefore the Figure mu&s;t give Place to the Sub&s;tance, and when the Sub&s;tance is enjoyed, the Figure cea&s;eth.</Q></P>
<P>AS to the Truth of our Principles, <Q>that there is but one Bapti&s;m to continue in the Church of Chri&s;t, there needs no other Proof than the&s;e Words, <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> iv. 5. One Lord, one Faith, one Bapti&s;m; where the Apo&s;tle plainly affirms that as there is but one Lord, one Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o there is but one Bapti&s;m. Apology 414.</Q> And the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t, being an Ordinance of Chri&s;t, by which, according to the Scriptures of
<PB N="3" REF="007983_0008_102E0CEDF566F988">
Truth, Sinners have been made Saints, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 letter">greeable to the Principles of the People called <HI>Qua<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> the one &s;aving Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>KNOW <HI>ye not that the Unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither For|nicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abu&s;ers of them&s;elves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Ex|tortioners, &s;hall inherit the Kingdom of God, and &s;uch were &s;ome of you; but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anc|tified, but ye are ju&s;tified in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God.</HI> 1 Corinthians, vi. 9, 10, 11.</P>
<P>AND now according to the Acknowledgement of the namele&s;s Author the Sub&s;tance of the Controver&s;y depends upon this, Whether Chri&s;t in&s;tituted a Water Bapti&s;m in his Church as a &s;tanding Ordinance, or not.</P>
<P>FOR Confirmation of his Water Argument (Page 4) he cites <HI>Matthew,</HI> xxviii. 19. <HI>Go ye there|fore and teach all Nations, bapti&s;ing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> From which he boldly a&s;&s;erts two po&s;itive Duties are enjoyned, to wit, the Duty of Teaching, and the Duty of Bapti&s;ing; but the Reader will find that the Text doth not &s;ay, teach and bapti&s;e (which according to his Definition it &s;hould have done) but teach all Na|tions bapti&s;ing them <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But herein he explains this Text contrary to mo&s;t of the approved Authors of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for they &s;ay it &s;hould be, go ye therefore and di&s;ciple all Nations by bapti&s;ing them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> well knowing that if they admit of the Word (Teach) according to the Text, it makes again&s;t the Bapti&s;m of Infants, they being incapable
<PB N="4" REF="007983_0009_102E0CF087B9E7C0">
of being Taught; and altho' this Author &s;aith in his Preface, that he hath on Purpo&s;e avoided &s;aying any Thing of Infant Bapti&s;m: Yet <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> with whom he is contending, &s;aith,
<Q>It is a meer human Tradition, for which neither Precept nor Practice is to be found in all the Scriptures.</Q></P>
<P>AND indeed that Text will make again&s;t him in that there is no Water there mentioned, or that can by any nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence be deduced thence. And as a certain Author of Note ob&s;erves,
<Q>The Commi&s;&s;ion there to bapti&s;e is not into the <HI>Water,</HI> but into the <HI>Name</HI> or <HI>Power</HI> (as the Word frequently &s;ignifies in the Scripture) <HI>of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and this Interpretation is &s;trongly &s;upported by Ver&s;e 18. <HI>All Power,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>is given unto me in Heaven and Earth,</HI> where Power and Name (Ver&s;e 19) are of the &s;ame Import: And likewi&s;e by <HI>Acts,</HI> i. 5. <HI>John truly,</HI> &s;aid Chri&s;t to his Apo&s;tles, <HI>bapti&s;ed with Water, but ye &s;hall be bapti&s;ed with the Holy Gho&s;t not many Days hence:</HI> Compare with Ver&s;e 8. <HI>Ye &s;hall re|ceive</HI> Power, <HI>after that the Holy Gho&s;t is come upon you, and ye &s;hall be Witne&s;&s;es unto me both in</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and in all</HI> Judea, <HI>and in</HI> Samaria, <HI>and unto the uttermo&s;t Part of the Earth.</HI></Q>
Thus far <HI>Jo&s;eph Be&s;&s;e,</HI> from R. C's <HI>Lux Evangelica Atte&s;tata.</HI></P>
<P>AND as <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> ob&s;erves, in Page 437,
<Q>Altho' it &s;hould be granted, that for a Sea&s;on they did &s;o far mi&s;take the Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Matthew</HI> xxviii. as to judge that Water belonged to that Bapti&s;m (which, however, I find no Nece&s;&s;ity of granting;) yet I &s;ee not any great Ab&s;urdity would thence follow, for it is plain they did mi&s;|take that Commi&s;&s;ion, as to the main Part of it,
<PB N="5" REF="007983_0010_102E0CF21F139CB8">
for a Sea&s;on, as where he bids them go teach all Nations, &s;ince &s;ome Time after they judged it unlawful to teach the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> yea <HI>Peter</HI> him&s;elf &s;crupled it, until by a Vi&s;ion con&s;trained there|unto; for which, after he had done it, he was for a Sea&s;on (until they were better informed) judged by the re&s;t of his Brethren. Now if the Education of the Apo&s;tles, as <HI>Jews,</HI> and their Propen&s;ity to adhere and &s;tick to the <HI>Jewi&s;h Religion,</HI> did &s;o far influence them, that, even after Chri&s;t's Re|&s;urrection and the pouring forth of the Spirit, they could not receive or admit of the teaching of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> tho' Chri&s;t in his Commi&s;&s;ion to them commanded them to preach to them; what further Ab&s;urdity were it to &s;uppo&s;e, that thro' the like Mi&s;take, the chiefe&s;t of them having been the Di&s;ciples of <HI>John,</HI> and his Bapti&s;m being &s;o much prized there among the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they al&s;o took Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m (intended by him of the Spirit) to be that of Water which was <HI>John</HI>'s, and accordingly practi&s;ed it for a Sea&s;on. It &s;uffices us that if they were &s;o mi&s;taken (tho' I &s;ay not that they were &s;o) they did not always remain under that Mi&s;take, el&s;e <HI>Peter</HI> would not have &s;aid of the Bapti&s;m which now &s;aves, that it is not <HI>a putting away</HI> of the Filth of the Fle&s;h, which certainly Water Bapti&s;m is.</Q></P>
<P>OUR Opponent, in Page 6 and 7, brings &s;everal Scriptures to prove the De&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t on the Apo&s;tles at the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> which in my Opinion, are a Confirmation of the Truth of that which he cannot deny, <HI>viz.</HI> That Chri&s;t's Bap|ti&s;m was a Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t and Fire: But he labors afterwards to confine that glorious
<PB N="6" REF="007983_0011_102E0CF53346CCF0">
Go&s;pel Privilege to the Days of the Apo&s;tles only, and to prove that the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Spirit is now cea&s;ed; and the ea&s;ier to impo&s;e upon his Readers, cites much of the 11th Chapter of <HI>Acts,</HI> till he comes to the 39 Ver&s;e, which is, <HI>For the Promi&s;e is to you and to your Children, and to all that are a-far off, even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call;</HI> not con&s;idering likewi&s;e, <HI>that no Man can</HI> (knowing|ly and experimentally) <HI>&s;ay that Je&s;us is the Lord but by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I would have the Reader ob&s;erve his Argument in his 7th Page, where he makes this Remark:
<Q>Now the Bapti&s;m in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us, being one of the Conditions upon which the Holy Gho&s;t is promi&s;ed, the Condition mu&s;t be per|formed before the Promi&s;e is to be fulfilled.</Q>
But how he will make this Doctrine agree with the Te&s;|timony of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> when at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Cornelius,</HI> for my Part I cannot &s;ee; but think that this one In&s;tance is enough to lay wa&s;te his whole Building. See <HI>Acts,</HI> x. 44. <HI>While</HI> Peter <HI>yet &s;pake the&s;e Words, the Holy Gho&s;t fell on all them which heard the Word;</HI> and after this it was that <HI>he commanded them to be bapti&s;ed in the Name</HI> of the Lord, Ver&s;e 48. So that it is evident that the Thing pro|mi&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t, was powerfully received by the efficatious Mini&s;try of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> before the Admini&s;tration of elementary Water was performed in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us: And therefore I would hope the Author will take Heed lea&s;t he be found darkening Council with Words without true Knowledge, and not only not entering him&s;elf but hindering tho&s;e that are about to enter.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007983_0012_102E0CF881317F08">THAT the <HI>Samaritans</HI> were bapti&s;ed with a different Bapti&s;m from that of the Holy Gho&s;t, as our Op|ponent &s;aith, Page 8, we freely grant; and that it was &s;uch a Bapti&s;m as fell &s;hort of giving <HI>the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience in the Sight of God,</HI> appears very plain in the &s;ame Chapter, from the In&s;tance of <HI>Simon.</HI> For notwith&s;tanding he was bapti&s;ed with Water, yet <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aith to him, <HI>Acts,</HI> viii. 23. <HI>I perceive thou art in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bond of Iniquity.</HI> Now if this Water Bapti&s;m had had that Virtue in it, which this Author hereafter urges from the Ex|ample of the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Naaman</HI> the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian,</HI> I &s;hould think that it would have broken <HI>Simon</HI>'s Bond of Iniquity and taken away his Gall of Bitterne&s;s, which it &s;eems it did not, and therefore cannot be the Bapti&s;m commanded; be|cau&s;e according to <HI>Mark,</HI> xvi. 16. He that believeth and is bapti&s;ed, &s;hall be &s;aved; and to &s;ay that he was in a State of Salvation, and yet in the Bond of Iniquity at the &s;ame Time, would be a Contradic|tion in Terms.</P>
<P>AS to what this Author &s;aith, Page 9 and 10, concerning <HI>Philip</HI>'s bapti&s;ing the Eunuch with Water, take the Reply of <HI>Jo&s;iah Fo&s;ter,</HI> in the <HI>Quaker</HI>'s An|&s;wer to the <HI>Norfolk</HI> Letter, Page 47.
<Q>That <HI>Philip</HI> bapti&s;ed the Eunuch with Water we que&s;tion not, but that he bapti&s;ed him in Pur&s;uance to Chri&s;t's Command, <HI>Matthew</HI> xxviii. we do not believe can ever be proved. It &s;eems mo&s;t probable by the concurring Circum&s;tances to have been in Relation to <HI>John</HI>'s Dipen&s;ation. Fir&s;t, it does not appear that the Action &s;prang from any Motion in <HI>Philip,</HI> but from the Eunuch's Reque&s;t: <HI>See here is Water, what hindreth me to be bapti&s;ed?</HI> Which Words
<PB N="8" REF="007983_0013_102E0CFC2F5D4650">
&s;hew that the Eunuch under&s;tood that Water Bap|ti&s;m was then in U&s;e, which he well might being him&s;elf a Pro&s;elyte to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion, on the Account of which he had then been at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> where he could not ea&s;ily mi&s;s of being informed of the &s;o noted Admini&s;tration of Water Bapti&s;m by <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t. And it is evident that <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m was in Practice a long Time after that. See <HI>Acts,</HI> xix. 3. Secondly, the prerequi&s;ite Qua|lifications for the Reception thereof agrees with that of <HI>John</HI>'s: A Belief in Chri&s;t was the Terms upon which the Eunuch was bapti&s;ed: When <HI>John</HI> bapti&s;ed he &s;aid unto the People that they &s;hould believe on him which &s;hould come after him, that is, on Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>Acts,</HI> xix. 4. Thirdly, <HI>Philip</HI>'s an&s;wering &s;o cooly in the permi&s;&s;ive Form [Thou maye&s;t] denotes it to be a Matter of In|difference, and not that which Chri&s;t had &s;o &s;o|lemnly enjoyned. <HI>Matthew,</HI> xxviii. 19. and <HI>Mark,</HI> xvi. 16.</Q></P>
<P>AS to the Ca&s;e of <HI>Paul,</HI> mentioned Page 10, after his Conver&s;ion, <HI>Acts,</HI> ix. I would have the Reader ob&s;erve how the Author, in Order to evade the Scope of the Text, leaves out Ver&s;e 17, where it is &s;aid, <HI>And Annanias went his way, and entered into the Hou&s;e, and putting his Hands on him, &s;aid Brother</HI> Saul, <HI>the Lord (even Je&s;us that appeared to thee in the Way as thou came&s;t) hath &s;ent me that thou mighte&s;t receive thy Sight, and be filled with the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> From which it is evident that <HI>Paul</HI> was filled with the Holy Gho&s;t by Virtue of this Me&s;&s;age, and <HI>Annanias,</HI> who was not one of the twelve Apo&s;tles, was made the In&s;trument. But the Author has, in the Margin, referred the Reader to <HI>Gallatians</HI> i. 11.
<PB N="9" REF="007983_0014_102E0CFDCCD6E938">
to 17. which I hope was not done with De&s;ign to pervert <HI>Paul</HI>'s Meaning, but to draw from thence &s;ome Pretence of Argument: Tho' he mu&s;t be a weak Reader who cannot &s;ee his Confu&s;ion when <HI>Paul</HI>'s Words are fairly &s;tated; Ver&s;e 11 and 12. <HI>But I certifie you Brethren that the Go&s;pel which was preached of me is not after Man; for I neither received it of Man, neither was I taught it but by the Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Which Text is very plain that <HI>Paul</HI> here &s;pake po&s;itively of his Commi&s;&s;ion to preach the Go&s;pel, and it hath no Reference to the Manner in which he was bapti&s;ed.</P>
<P>AS to what he urges, Page 11, of <HI>Peter</HI>'s bapti&s;|ing the Hou&s;e of <HI>Cornelius</HI> with Water, after they had received the Holy Gho&s;t, he mu&s;t have forgot his A&s;&s;ertion in Page 7, where he makes a being bapti&s;ed in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Condition of the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t that it mu&s;t be performed before the Promi&s;e is to be fulfilled. For here it is evident they had received the Promi&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t, before they were bapti&s;ed in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>AND is it not manife&s;t, from this Text, to every unprejudiced Reader, that Water Bapti&s;m is not nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; for it is undeniable that when they had received the Holy Gho&s;t they were in a State of Salvation, and Water Bapti&s;m, with which they had not been bapti&s;ed, could not put them in that State.</P>
<P>AND ob&s;erve, the Apo&s;tle puts the Que&s;tion, <HI>Can any Man forbid,</HI> &amp;c. and that being an Appeal to the Judgement of Men, concerning the Fitne&s;s or Unfitne&s;s of the Thing, one would think he would

not have done it had it been a plain and po&s;itive Duty; which appears to me a good Argument that this cannot be the Bapti&s;m enjoined, <HI>Matthew</HI> xxviii. But that the being bapti&s;ed in the Name of the Lord was no other than <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m we &s;hall endeavour to make appear.</P>
<P>THE Author, Page 11, cites <HI>Acts</HI> xix. 2, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from thence attempts to prove three different Bap|ti&s;ms, <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, <HI>John</HI>'s; &s;econdly, In the Name of the Lord; and thirdly, The Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t. And as he has made Choice of that of being bapti&s;ed in the Name of the Lord, for his Foundation to build his Argument upon, for a Water Bapti&s;m to remain a &s;tanding Ordinance in the Church, by Virtue of a Command of Chri&s;t, I &s;hall pro|duce &s;undry Authorities taken from <HI>Jo&s;iah Fo&s;ter,</HI> Page 64, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>

<P><HI>Jo&s;iah Fo&s;ter,</HI> in his before mentioned Di&s;cour&s;e, Page 73, in An&s;wer to an Oppo&s;er much in the &s;ame Strain with this Author, hath this Remark:
<Q>For as much then as upon an impartial Examination, it ob|viou&s;ly appears not only con&s;i&s;tent with the holy Writ but al&s;o corre&s;pondent with the expre&s;s Doc|trine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as laid down by &s;undry of her apologetical Theologi&s;ts, and other Prote&s;tant Writers, that the Water Bapti&s;m which the Apo&s;tles u&s;ed was no other than that of <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t; and that it is too apparent to be de|nied (even as this Author him&s;elf allows) that the
<PB N="12" REF="007983_0017_102E0D064D06BF50">
Bapti&s;m of <HI>John</HI> is aboli&s;hed, it therefore naturally follows, as an undeniable Con&s;equence, from the the Premi&s;es, that that Bapti&s;m which the Apo&s;tles u&s;ed is aboli&s;hed likewi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>WHEREFORE, upon the whole, I doubt not but it will be plain to every unprejudiced Reader, that this Author, by his maintaining the Abolition of <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m, has quite done the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Water Bapti&s;m for ever, and laid his own Structure as pro&s;trate as ever the Image of <HI>Dagon</HI> lay before the Ark of God.</P>
<P>THE Author a&s;&s;erts, in Page 12, that <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> in his Apology, Page 431, acknowledges that the Word <HI>bapti&s;e</HI>
<Q>always &s;ignifies in Scripture a being bapti&s;ed with Water, and not with the Spirit, when it &s;tands &s;ingly and without other Words to di&s;tingui&s;h the particular Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q>
But as I have examined that Page and can find nothing that will bear that Con&s;truction, I &s;hall return it upon him as a fal&s;e Accu&s;ation till he makes it fairly appear.</P>
<P>HE has ri&s;en to a great Height, Page 14, even to a&s;&s;ert that Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m was a Water Bapti&s;m as had been and would be further proved; which, if he means elementary Water, appears to me to be a great Pre&s;umption&punc; but, for the Satisfaction of the Reader, let us examine his Proofs, as referred to in the Margin: The fir&s;t is <HI>Acts,</HI> ii. 28. <HI>Thou ha&s;t made known to me the Ways of Life; thou &s;halt make me full of Joy with thy Countenance.</HI> This hath not the lea&s;t Shadow of Proof in it, but quite the contrary, as it refers to inward Communion with God.</P>
<P>HIS &s;econd Proof is <HI>Mark,</HI> xvi. 16. <HI>He that be|lieveth and is bapti&s;ed &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that be|lieveth
<PB N="13" REF="007983_0018_102E0D089E048A30" MS="y">
not &s;hall be damned.</HI> Which will be of no Service to &s;upport his Argument, unle&s;s he can prove the Bapti&s;m herein mentioned to be a Water Bapti&s;m. But it is evident to me that this Text ought not to be under&s;tood of Water Bapti&s;m, from the following Con&s;iderations: Fir&s;t, the Ca&s;e of <HI>Simon,</HI> mentioned before, who was, notwith&s;tanding his being bapti&s;ed with Water, left in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bond of Iniquity. As to the Author's Reply to this Argu|ment, in his Treati&s;e, it will be an&s;wered in its proper Place. Secondly, that of <HI>Peter</HI> in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, iii. 21. <HI>The like Figure whereunto even Bapti&s;m doth al&s;o now &s;ave us (not the putting away of the Filth of the Fle&s;h, but the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience to|wards God) by the Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And as elementary Water can only wa&s;h the Filth of the Fle&s;h, but not give the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience, &s;o the Bapti&s;m which &s;aves mu&s;t be that which will <HI>wa&s;h the Heart from Wickedne&s;s.</HI> Jeremiah, iv. 14. <HI>O</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>wa&s;h thine Heart from Wickedne&s;s, that thou maye&s;t be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the Bapti&s;m of <HI>John</HI> had God for its Author we agree with our Opponent, Page 15, and that it was preparatory to Chri&s;t: And we further agree with him that it is now cea&s;ed, as has been ob&s;erved before.</P>
<P>THAT the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t hath not only God for its Author, but was in&s;tituted for much higher and more excellent Ends, we al&s;o heartily agree; but that it was with outward Water he has not yet proved, and therefore we &s;hall deny his A&s;&s;ertion in that Re&s;pect, as it would greatly tend to eclip&s;ing the glorious Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007983_0019_102E0D0C8FA26548" MS="y">AND that Bapti&s;m which is to continue in the Church of Chri&s;t to the End of the World, and which he will accompany with his Pre&s;ence, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be with the Holy Gho&s;t and Fire; as that alone purifies the Heart, and effectually clean&s;es from former Defilements, and puts Mankind into a State of Salvation, by becoming true Members of that my&s;tical Body, of which Chri&s;t is the Head, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit of God the Father: With|out unnece&s;&s;arily running Men and Women into that frequent Pre&s;umption, of promi&s;ing that for others which they acknowledge they cannot do for them&s;elves, when they &s;tand as God-Fathers and God-Mothers, in executing the Ceremony of Water Bapti&s;m, according to what the Church of <HI>England</HI> requires.</P>
<P>I agree with the Author, Page 16, that the Ends for which the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t and that of <HI>John</HI> were in&s;tituted are quite different, and that they can|not be the &s;ame Bapti&s;ms; but that they were both of Water he has not yet proved, without his bare A&s;&s;ertion can be taken for Proof. And that the Difference between the&s;e two Bapti&s;ms, both in Sub|&s;tance and Effect, is very great, will plainly appear, by con&s;idering <HI>John</HI>'s to be elementary, Chri&s;t's to be &s;piritual; the one to be preparatory to Chri&s;t's Di&s;pen&s;ation and figurative of his Bapti&s;m, and the other to be the inward Purgation of the Soul from Sin, by the clean&s;ing Virtue of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>THE Author, Page 16, brings what he calls a mo&s;t familiar In&s;tance of entering into three Cove|nants, and &s;ealing them all with Wax, which, in the Conclu&s;ion, that he confe&s;&s;eth he would willingly have excu&s;ed him&s;elf the Trouble of &s;tating.
<Q>But
<PB N="15" REF="007983_0020_102E0D0E2AB17180">
as tho&s;e who deny Water Bapti&s;m have confounded this Di&s;tinction and complicated all Water Bap|ti&s;ms, &s;o as if they were one and the &s;ame, and not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, he could not allow him&s;elf to pa&s;s it by altogether.</Q>
And &s;o by the Way he a&s;&s;erts three different Bapti&s;ms, and that Water is the Wax in all of them, as if he intended to impo&s;e upon his Readers by taking the Point in Di&s;pute for granted, <HI>viz.</HI> That Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m is a Water Bapti&s;m, without one clear Scripture Proof: So that Reader, if thou wilt believe him, thou mu&s;t rely upon his own bare A&s;&s;ertion, notwith&s;tanding it contradicts the Scriptures of Truth, and the Judgement of &s;everal approved Writers of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for which he would make the World believe that he is now become an Advocate.</P>
<P>WE deny his A&s;&s;ertion that Water is the Wax in the&s;e three Bapti&s;ms, &s;eeing he intends Chri&s;t's to be one of them; and he might have &s;pared his Pains, and &s;huned running into &s;o great an Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>AND now I would have the Reader take Notice, that this Author, Page 18, is going about to prove a Difference between the Bapti&s;m ordained by Chri&s;t, as a &s;tanding Ordinance in his Church, and the Bap|ti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, which, if he &s;hould do, the whole Point mu&s;t be given up to him; and mo&s;t of the Writers upon the Subject of Bapti&s;m may put their Hands to their Mouths and &s;ay, That he has done more than ever could be done before.</P>
<P>BUT as the Subject is very important, and ought not to be handled carele&s;ly, it will be very proper for us to take good Heed that he doth not impo&s;e upon us, by endeavouring to limit the Di&s;pen&s;ations of the Mo&s;t High to Mankind. That the Bapti&s;m
<PB N="16" REF="007983_0021_102E0D0FCEFDA198">
of Chri&s;t was with the Holy Gho&s;t and Fire, is too evident to be denied; and he him&s;elf cites &s;everal Places of Scripture to prove it; but then endeavours to confine this Privilege to the Days of the Apo&s;tles only. Which is a taking away the Key of Know|ledge, and falling into the two Evils complained of, of old: <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> ii. 13. <HI>They have for&s;aken me the Fountain of living Waters, and hewed them cut Ci&s;terns, broken Ci&s;terns, that can hold no Water.</HI> Now to know whether the pouring forth of the Spirit, on the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> was an Accompli&s;hment, according to this Author (by which I &s;uppo&s;e he means a fini&s;hing or ending) of the Prophecy of the Prophet <HI>Joel;</HI> or whether it had only fallen out at that Time, and upon tho&s;e Per&s;ons, agreeable to what that Pro|phet had foretold &s;hould come to pa&s;s in the latter Days upon all the Church of Chri&s;t, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to have the Words of <HI>Peter</HI> fairly &s;tated: <HI>Acts,</HI> ii. 16, 17, 18. But this is that which was &s;poken by the Prophet <HI>Joel,</HI> and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the la&s;t Days &s;aith God, <HI>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fle&s;h; and your Sons and your Daughters &s;hall prophecy, and your young Men &s;hall &s;ee Vi&s;ions, and your old Men &s;hall dream Dreams, and on my Servants, and on my Handmaids I will pour out in tho&s;e Days of my Spirit, and they &s;hall prophecy:</HI> And in Ver&s;e 39, before cited, <HI>For the Promi&s;e is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are a-far off, even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call.</HI> So that the pouring forth of the Spirit, even in <HI>Peter</HI>'s Judgement, mu&s;t be the Privilege of every Chri&s;tian. Yet this Author affirms, Page 19, That this amaz|ing and miraculous Effu&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t is expre&s;ly &s;aid by St. <HI>Peter</HI> to be the Accompli&s;hment
<PB N="17" REF="007983_0022_102E0D1244F397E8" MS="y">
of <HI>Joel</HI>'s Prophecy.

<P>AND in Order to confine the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t to the Days of the Apo&s;tles, and to ex|clude it after, he tells us the Meaning thereof, is, being endowed with extraordinary and &s;upernatural Gifts; &s;uch as a Power to work Miracles, &s;peak with Tongues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this he &s;aith, Page 20,

<P>IN the Bottom of Page 22, this Author a&s;&s;erts that <HI>no Per&s;on,</HI> but the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, could be the in&s;trumental Cau&s;e of the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t; but I have before &s;hewn, that <HI>Annanias,</HI> who was not one of the twelve Apo&s;tles, was the In&s;tru|ment to <HI>Paul</HI>'s being bapti&s;ed with the Holy Gho&s;t; which doth evidently appear by <HI>Acts</HI> ix. 17. <HI>And</HI> Annanias <HI>went his way, and entered into the Hou&s;e, and putting his Hands upon him &s;aid, Brother</HI> Saul, <HI>the Lord (even Je&s;us that appeared unto thee in the Way as thou came&s;t) hath &s;ent me that thou mighte&s;t receive thy Sight, and be filled with the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> If he &s;hould &s;ay that this is only a &s;ingle In&s;tance, I an&s;wer, that one &s;ingle In&s;tance, &s;upported by un|deniable Authority, is &s;ufficient to overthrow his whole Building, as it &s;tands upon &s;o &s;andy a Foun|dation; and I hope there are but few Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who are &s;erious in their Re|ligion, that will venture to join with him.</P>

<P>SEVERAL Pages of this Author's Treati&s;e &s;eem, in my Opinion, to be little el&s;e but the Product of his own Imaginations, to limit the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t to the Apo&s;tles only; and his Arguments will amount to little more than this: That the Apo&s;tles were &s;ent for to tho&s;e that were lately convinced of the Chri&s;|tian Religion, and that upon the laying on of their Hands the Holy Gho&s;t was given, or fell on them; but how this doth limit that Favor to the Apo&s;tles only doth not yet appear, but quite the contrary, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Annanias</HI> beforementioned. And that the Author may &s;ee how tickli&s;h he &s;tands, I &s;hall add to the foregoing Authorities, as a full An&s;wer to what he has a&s;&s;erted on this Head, an excellent Pa&s;&s;age of Bi&s;hop <HI>Taylor,</HI> who &s;peaking concerning <HI>Matthew</HI> iii. 2. <HI>He &s;hall bapti&s;e you with the Holy Gho&s;t and Fire,</HI> &s;ays,

<HI>Libert. of Proph.</HI> Page 231.</P>
<P>THE Authorities before mentioned are &s;o far from confining the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t to tho&s;e extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit be&s;towed on Particu|lars in the Apo&s;tles Time, as that of Tongues, heal|ing the Sick, rai&s;ing the Dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they una|nimou&s;ly make it to be that Gift, or Mea&s;ure of the Holy Spirit, which regenerates and renews the Heart, purges the Con&s;cience, clean&s;es from Sin, illuminates the Mind, kindles Zeal and Love both towards God and our Neighbour, warms and influences the Heart with a Sen&s;e of God's Love, rai&s;es &s;piritual Habits in the Soul, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nay, in fine, they &s;eem to a&s;cribe thereto the whole Work of Regeneration and Sancti|fication produced in the Soul from a State of Nature to a perfect Man in a State of Grace.</P>

Wherefore if this Author will abide by his A&s;&s;ertion, that the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t is cea&s;ed, he mu&s;t renounce all the before cited Autho|rities (and lay by his Common-Prayer-Book, &s;ince it teacheth to pray for the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t) and thereby, at once, declare him&s;elf to be neither <HI>Roman-</HI>Catholic, Church of <HI>England-</HI>Man, <HI>Pre&s;by|terian,</HI> nor <HI>Anabapti&s;t,</HI> &s;ince this dark Notion will not agree with the Judgement of either of the before|mentioned Communities.</P>

<Q>That the one Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t is not a Wa&s;hing with Water, appears from 1 <HI>Peter</HI> iii. 21. <HI>The like Figure whereunto even Bapti&s;m doth al&s;o now &s;ave us (not the putting away the Filth of the Fle&s;h but the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience towards God) by the Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> So plain a Definition of Bapti&s;m is not to be found in all the Bible, and therefore &s;eeing it is &s;o plain it may very well be preferred to all the coined Defini|tions of the Schoolmen. The Apo&s;tle tells, <HI>fir&s;t negatively,</HI> what it is not, <HI>viz.</HI> not a putting away of the Filth of the Fle&s;h; then &s;urely it is not a Wa&s;hing with Water, &s;ince that is &s;o. <HI>Secondly,</HI> he tells us, affirmatively, what it is, <HI>viz.</HI> the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience towards God by the Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>AND &s;ince he has been &s;o kind to furni&s;h me with the before-mentioned Scriptures, and allow them to be equally plain and de&s;criptive of the &s;ame Thing with that, 1 <HI>Peter</HI> iii. 21. mentioned by <HI>Robert Bar|clay,</HI> I &s;hall now endeavour to &s;hew that they are good Arguments for us again&s;t him.

<P>BUT as <HI>Jo&s;iah Fo&s;ter</HI> ob&s;erves, Page 123,
<Q>It is an inconte&s;tible Point, that the Bapti&s;m with Water and the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t are two different Bapti&s;ms and di&s;tinct from each other; and the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts no more than one Bapti&s;m in the Chri&s;tian Church, <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> iv. 5. it mu&s;t be allowed to be one of the two.</Q></P>

And as <HI>Jo&s;iah Fo&s;ter</HI> ob&s;erves, in Page 124,
<Q>As the Apo&s;tle told the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> there is one Body and one Bapti&s;m; &s;o he told the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that by one Spirit they were all bap|ti&s;ed into one Body.</Q></P>
<P>OUR Opponent &s;aith, Page 35,
<Q>That the&s;e Words of St. <HI>Peter</HI> prove nothing more than what the other Texts do, <HI>viz.</HI> That the outward Ad|mini&s;tration of Water Bapti&s;m is nece&s;&s;ary, but not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;ci|ence, without which, in the Sight of God, the outward Admini&s;tration will avail nothing.</Q>
Which indeed would have been a good Confe&s;&s;ion if he had put the Words <HI>not nece&s;&s;ary</HI> after Water Bapti&s;m in|&s;tead of <HI>is nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="007983_0037_102E0D3884901F10" MS="y">BUT now he proceeds, and &s;ays, That Chri&s;t who is gone into Heaven hath put that Virtue into Bapti&s;m that by it we are &s;aved; &s;o &s;ay I: But if he means Water Bapti&s;m it is denied, and the Con|trary &s;ufficently proved.

<P>IN Page 36, our Opponent a&s;&s;erts, that tho&s;e who &s;ay St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Words, <HI>Not the putting away the Filth of the Fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. are a Negation of Water Bapti&s;m, mu&s;t charge him with a Contradiction, bacau&s;e he &s;aid, <HI>Acts</HI> xi. 38. <HI>Repent and be bapti&s;ed every one of you in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins;</HI> but here I would have the Reader ob&s;erve, that this Bapti&s;m in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t has already been proved, by undoubted Authorities, to be <HI>John</HI>'s, which this Author him&s;elf acknowledges to be cea&s;ed. And the other Words of <HI>Peter, Not the puting away the Filth of the Fle&s;h,</HI> were penned about twenty Years after, by which Time the Apo&s;tles (whatever they had thought to the contrary before) were no Doubt fully convinced that Water Bapti&s;m was not nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, or <HI>Peter</HI> would not have been &s;o expre&s;s and clear in the Point. And let our Op|ponent

make appear, by any Text of Scripture, that ever any of the Apo&s;tles bapti&s;ed with Water after the penning of this Epi&s;tle of <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<P>BUT before I leave this Paragraph I would willingly query with the Author concerning tho&s;e Words of <HI>Peter Acts</HI> ii. 38. <HI>Repent and be bapti&s;ed for the Remi&s;&s;i|on of Sins;</HI> whether this Bapti&s;m is the &s;ame which is practi&s;ed by the Church of <HI>England?</HI> And if it is, whether Infants are capable of Repentance, or of pro|mi&s;ing that they will repent; or whether they have any Sin to repent of? Seeing where there is no Law there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. And our Saviour &s;aid of &s;uch is the Kingdom of God, and propo&s;es little Children to us as Patterns of Innocency, agreeable to that Ex|pre&s;&s;ion in the Common Prayer-Book: How he ex|horteth all Men to follow their Innocency, <HI>i. e.</HI> little Children's Innocency.</P>
<P>OUR Opponent will not admit, Page 37, of the Sufficiency of that Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> That,
<Q>be|cau&s;e many are bapti&s;ed with Water that are not &s;aved, therefore Water Bapti&s;m is not the Bapti&s;m meant by <HI>Peter.</HI></Q>
But being here met with in a narrow Place, and like <HI>Baalam</HI> &s;till willing to ru&s;h on, let his Way be never &s;o perver&s;e in the Eyes of the Lord: He &s;tuffs two or three Pages chief|ly with this Argument, That altho' many are bap|ti&s;ed with Water that are not &s;aved thereby, yet it is no more an Argument again&s;t Water Bapti&s;m than for tho&s;e who had been bapti&s;ed with the Holy Gho&s;t and fell away from that State, to be brought as an Argument again&s;t the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t. According to which, in Page 41 and 42, he &s;aith,
<Q>If there was a <HI>Symon</HI> who was bapti&s;ed with Water who&s;e Heart was afterwards found not right in the
<PB N="34" REF="007983_0039_102E0D3D62DD5AA0">
Sight of God, there was al&s;o a <HI>Nicholas</HI> who was bapti&s;ed with the Holy Gho&s;t who&s;e Practices and Doctrine were afterwards hated by the beloved Apo&s;tle of our Lord;</Q>
and the&s;e Compari&s;ons &s;eem to be &s;uppo&s;ed by him to be equal, which in my Opinion may be ea&s;ily confuted. For fir&s;t, we can prove that <HI>Simon</HI> was in the Bond of Iniquity and Gall of Bit|terne&s;s at the Time of his being bapti&s;ed with Water, by the Te&s;timony of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter, Acts</HI> viii. 23. But if he cannot prove that <HI>Nicholas</HI> was guilty of &s;uch Practices, and held &s;uch Doctrine as was hateful to the beloved Di&s;ciple at the Time of his being bap|ti&s;ed with the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> that if he cannot make that appear, his Compari&s;on is no way equal. And we have always denied that Doctrine, <HI>Once in Grace ever in Grace;</HI> but do believe a Po&s;&s;ibility of falling from Grace and high Attainments, and that our Safety depends upon a con&s;tant Obedience to the righteous Law of God written in our Hearts; and that no Man after he has put his Hand to the Plough and looks back again is fit for the Kingdom of God. <HI>Luke</HI> ix. 62. So that a Per&s;on's falling from Grace of heavenly Attainments is no Argument that the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t is not Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m which is to continue to the End of the World; but a Per&s;on's being in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bond of Iniquity at the Time of receiving Water Bapti&s;m, is an undeniable Proof that People may be admitted to that Ceremony, and yet be far &s;hort of acquiring the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience thereby; and that Water Bapti&s;m cannot be that Bapti&s;m mentioned <HI>Mark</HI> xvi. 10. becau&s;e <HI>Simon</HI> both believed and was bapti&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding which he remained in the

Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bond of Iniquity, which is far &s;hort of a State of Salvation.</P>
<P>HAVING thus endeavoured to remove this Author's Cavil again&s;t <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> on this Head, I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon his Arguments being &s;ound and undeni|able until I &s;ee them confuted by better Rea&s;ons than <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> has offered. And that the Reader may &s;ee the Ab&s;urdity of his Arguments, Page 39 and 40, where he &s;eems to allow, that tho&s;e who have been bapti&s;ed with Water have put on Chri&s;t, I &s;hall offer &s;ome Ob&s;ervations taken out of <HI>Jo&s;iah Fo&s;ter,</HI> Page 109, who &s;peaking concerning <HI>Galatians</HI> iii. 17. <HI>For as many of you as have been bapti&s;ed into Chri&s;t have put on Chri&s;t;</HI> &s;aith,
<Q>The cleare&s;t Way to find out what Bapti&s;m the Apo&s;tle has relation to here, whether the Bapti&s;m of the Spirit or that of Water, is to con&s;ider what he means by that rhetorical Phra&s;e, <HI>to put on Chri&s;t. Beza</HI> on <HI>Romans</HI> xiii. 14. &s;ays, "To put on Chri&s;t is to po&s;&s;e&s;s him, &s;o as to have him in us and us in him." Doctor <HI>Hammond</HI> ex|pounds it thus, "&s;et your&s;elves to the Practice of all Chri&s;tian Purity." <HI>Burkett</HI> thereon &s;ays, "Set the Doctrine and Life of Chri&s;t continually before you; follow every In&s;titution and imitate all the Parts of his holy Conver&s;ation; even as the Gar|ment is commen&s;urate to the Body." May not the Expo&s;ition, &s;aith he, imply that the Soul of Man &s;ince the Fall is in a naked State, de&s;titute of tho&s;e divine Graces of the Holy Spirit which were its original Cloathing in the Day of undefiled Innocency.</Q></P>
<P>AND as this Author, Page 39, &s;eems al&s;o to ex|plain the Meaning of this Text, <HI>Know ye not that &s;o many of us as were bapti&s;ed into Je&s;us Chri&s;t were
<PB N="36" REF="007983_0041_102E0D4222BB1918">
bapti&s;ed into his Death: Therefore we are buried with him by Bapti&s;m into Death, that like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed up from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even &s;o we al&s;o &s;hall walk in Newne&s;s of Life. Romans</HI> vi. 3, 4, in Favor of Water Bapti&s;m, I &s;hall furni&s;h the Reader with the Judgment of Bi&s;hop <HI>Taylor</HI> on the &s;ame Place, taken out of <HI>Jo&s;iah Fo&s;ter,</HI> Page 113, who &s;ays,
<Q>All this is nothing but Crucifixion of the old Man; a de&s;troying the Body of Sin, that we no longer &s;erve Sin.</Q>
And if &s;o, then it is ea&s;ily for&s;een what naturally follows from this Author's Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> That Water Bapti&s;m crucifies the old Man, or Nature of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> de&s;troys the Body of Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is &s;uch a whim&s;ical Notion as even a Papi&s;t would be a&s;hamed of: So that here is a great Ab&s;urdity ari&s;ing from his Doctrine, and more e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered that by his own Con|fe&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t he can make of Water Bapti&s;m is this, that it is but one of the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary Parts of the one &s;aving Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>BUT when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays we are buried with Chri&s;t by Bapti&s;m into his Death, his Meaning is very obvious, that as Chri&s;t's Humanity or Veil of Fle&s;h was crucified and buried, &s;o by Bapti&s;m, <HI>that is,</HI> through the regenerating Power of the Holy Spirit, which wa&s;hes and &s;anctifies the Soul, the old Man, the Body of Sin in us, is crucified, de&s;troyed, and as it were laid in the Grave. Then with Re&s;pect to our being rai&s;ed from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even &s;o we al&s;o &s;hould walk in Newne&s;s of Life; which plainly &s;ets forth that as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the Dead by the glorious Power of the Father, &s;o is our new Man rai&s;ed to Holine&s;s of Life by the &s;ame divine Power or Spirit of God. In
<PB N="37" REF="007983_0042_102E0D448CE61BD8">
&s;hort if all this according to the learned Bi&s;hop's A&s;|&s;ertion be nothing but Crucifixion of the old Man, de&s;troying the Body of Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then mo&s;t evidently the Bapti&s;m which produces &s;uch an Effect is nothing el&s;e but that of the Spirit, and the very &s;ame is to be under&s;tood concerning <HI>Collo&s;ians</HI> ii. 12. 13, where the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in Terms equivalent to this of <HI>Romans</HI> vi. 4. As to the Author's Paraphra&s;e on the&s;e Texts, what can it be called more properly than a Jargon of Words without Coherence re&s;pect|ing the Nature of the Ca&s;e? Con&s;idering that he him|&s;elf is obliged to allow that the Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t is one and the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Part of the true and &s;aving Bapti&s;m, Page 34.</P>
<P>THE Author being met with in a narrow Place, as I &s;aid before, and &s;orely pinched, rather than yield to common Ju&s;tice, has Recour&s;e to the Conclu&s;ion of the Harlot, who had no ju&s;t Claim to the living Child; 1 <HI>Kings</HI> iii. 26. <HI>Let it be neither mine nor thine but divide it.</HI> For in the Nature of his Arguments, and by his unequal Compari&s;ons, he has confounded both Bapti&s;ms, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Spirit as well as that of elementary Water; but then confe&s;&s;es, Page 42, that this Argument is fal&s;e, which I &s;hall readily grant him; but &s;hall deny him his faint Argument,
<Q>That Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m, in&s;tituted as a &s;tanding Ordinance in his Church, <HI>may be</HI> a Water Bapti&s;m, notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome of tho&s;e who were bapti&s;ed with it afterwards became wicked Men:</Q>
If he had dealt hone&s;tly he &s;hould have &s;aid <HI>were then</HI> wicked Men. But the Reader may ob&s;erve that his confident A&s;|&s;ertions are now come to a <HI>may be</HI> a Water Bapti&s;m, and this I utterly refu&s;e to grant him, without he can bring me into &s;uch a Streight, that like the true

Mother of the living Child, I &s;hould rather cho&s;e to &s;ee the fal&s;e Mother have it than that it &s;hould divided.

<P>HE now would in&s;inuate, Page 43, that as &s;oon as the Me&s;&s;ias was made known to the World, <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m mu&s;t cea&s;e of Cour&s;e; and that <HI>John</HI>'s Bap|ti&s;m <HI>may be</HI> the Figure of a Water Bapti&s;m in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t. I an&s;wer, that when the Me&s;&s;iah offered up him&s;elf upon the Cro&s;s he blotted out the Hand Writing of Ordinances, and put an End to Circum|ci&s;ion and all the Ceremonies of the Law; and he now circumci&s;eth the Hearts of People by which they are made true <HI>Jews,</HI> who&s;e Prai&s;e is not of Men but of God. <HI>Romans</HI> ii. 29. And yet we find that Circumci&s;ion was practi&s;ed thro' Conde&s;cen&s;ion, after the A&s;&s;en&s;ion of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Timothy,</HI> and that of <HI>Peter</HI>'s con&s;training the Gen|tiles to be circumci&s;ed; and why might not the Apo&s;tles bapti&s;e with <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m of Water from the &s;ame Motives of Conde&s;cen&s;ion of becoming all Things to all Men, to &s;ave &s;ome, without giving any more ju&s;t Argument for Water Bapti&s;m to re|main a &s;tanding Ordinance in the Church of Chri&s;t, than for Circumci&s;ion; &s;eeing that the mo&s;t that can be made of either of them, is this, that they were but Types or Figures to point out the Sub&s;tance, and where the Sub&s;tance is enjoyed, now under the Go&s;pel, they are become but like the brazen Serpent, a mere Piece of Bra&s;s; which tho' very good in its Time, yet the good King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> xviii. 4&punc; when he found the People idolizing it, broke it
<PB N="39" REF="007983_0044_102E0D4A16180568">
in Pieces; and I take this Water Bapti&s;m which this Author &s;eems to be in &s;o much Pain to e&s;tabli&s;h the Nece&s;&s;ity of, to have no more Virtue in it than a mere Piece of Bra&s;s, a Nehu&s;htan.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m being a Figure of a Water Bapti&s;m in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, I would have the Reader con&s;ider what an ab&s;urd Notion it mu&s;t be; &s;eeing Chri&s;t's Water Bapti&s;m (if we could &s;uppo&s;e any &s;uch Thing) can be nothing but a Type or Figure, for there is no one I pre&s;ume &s;o weak as to &s;ay it is the Sub&s;tance: And is there any Sen&s;e in the&s;e Ex|pre&s;&s;ions? A Figure of a Figure, a Type of a Type, or a Shadow of a Shadow. But does it not look as if this Notion proceeded from a De&s;ire of keeping us from the Sub&s;tance, and ever gra&s;ping after Sha|dows.</P>
<P>AS to his A&s;&s;ertion, Page 43, that the Apo&s;tles always under&s;tood the Command of Chri&s;t, <HI>Matthew</HI> xviii. to mean a Water Bapti&s;m, I cannot allow it to be Truth; and herein he may &s;ee that it is not beyond Contradiction: I have before &s;hewn that the Text is, <HI>Teach all Nations bapti&s;ing them,</HI> &amp;c. which never can fairly be con&s;trued to mean two po&s;itive Duties (as he before affirms) but &s;imply that as Chri&s;t promi&s;ed his Pre&s;ence to accompany them in this Service, their Doctrine &s;hould be attended with that Power which &s;hould prick the Heart, and have in it that bapti&s;ing Quality (as it was not they that were to &s;peak, but the Spirit of their Father which was in them) that the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hould fall on the Hearers by Virtue of their Mini&s;try, as on <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his Hou&s;e at the preaching of <HI>Peter.</HI> And &s;o I &s;hall agree with this Author that that Ordinance which Chri&s;t has been plea&s;ed to in&s;titute, and has promi&s;ed to
<PB N="40" REF="007983_0045_102E0D4C66F845C8">
accompany with the &s;anctifying Graces of his divine Spirit mu&s;t be &s;ome thing more than a mere carnal and ceremonial, it mu&s;t be a pure and &s;piritual Ordi|nance which I do a&s;&s;ert to be the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t; and deny his Water Arguments as being much beneath the Dignity of a glorious Go&s;pel or &s;piritual Di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>AND now, friendly Reader, if thy Patience has been &s;ufficient to accompany me in tracing this Author thro' his &s;ometimes one Thing and &s;ometimes another, I doubt not but thou ha&s;t, with me, found many In|con&s;i&s;tencies, notwith&s;tanding his Learning and Abi|lity as a Man.</P>
<P>BUT let us have a little more Patience and &s;ee whether the re&s;t of his Arguments have any more Weight in them.</P>
<P>AS to his Argument, Page 45, concerning the Samene&s;s of the Word in the general Command, <HI>Matthew</HI> xviii. 19. and in 1 <HI>Corinthians</HI> i. 17. it can have no more Force to prove the&s;e two Bapti&s;ms one and the &s;ame, than it would to prove all Bapti&s;ms alike in the whole Scriptures wherever that Word is made U&s;e of; &s;eeing there are other Words in both Texts &s;ufficient to point out plainly what Kind of Bapti&s;m is meant in each. That in <HI>Matthew</HI> xxviii. is, <HI>Teach all Nations bapti&s;ing them,</HI> &amp;c. which, as has been &s;hewn before, &s;ignifies a bapti&s;ing Quality to accompany a true Mini&s;try, and &s;o mu&s;t be meant of the Spirit of Truth, which leads into all Truth. The other in 1 <HI>Corinthians</HI> i. is, <HI>Chri&s;t &s;ent me not to bapti&s;e but to preach the Go&s;pel;</HI> &s;o that this mu&s;t be under&s;tood of Water Bapti&s;m as this Author rightly ob&s;erves, and therefore it may be &s;afe to con|clude that neither <HI>Paul</HI> nor any of the Apo&s;tles had
<PB N="41" REF="007983_0046_102DC8CACAF3C988">
a Commi&s;&s;ion to bapti&s;e with Water, and what they did in this Re&s;pect was in Conde&s;cen&s;ion to the In|fancy of the Times, like that of Circumci&s;ion; and herein <HI>Paul</HI> was nothing behind the chiefe&s;t of the Apo&s;tles either with Regard to Water Bapti&s;m or in Re&s;pect of the general Commi&s;&s;ion in <HI>Matthew.</HI> For this Author has brought <HI>Timothy</HI> and the Di&s;ciples at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> as Seals that <HI>Paul</HI> had Power to confer the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t: But to make Water Bapti&s;m &s;aving would not only make <HI>Paul</HI> inferior to the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, but al&s;o to accu&s;e him of being guilty of thanking God for having done him &s;o little Service as the bapti&s;ing &s;o few with Water.</P>
<P>AND I would have the Reader ob&s;erve how this Author, about the Middle of Page 46, makes an Addition of the Word <HI>and</HI> bapti&s;e, in the general Command, which if allowed would bring a Con|tradiction on <HI>Paul,</HI> who &s;aid <HI>Chri&s;t &s;ent me not to bapti&s;e but to preach the Go&s;pel,</HI> 1 <HI>Corinthians</HI> i. 17. but it has been acknowledged to be a Water Bapti&s;m, in this la&s;t Place, that <HI>Paul</HI> meant, which he &s;ays he was not &s;ent to bapti&s;e with; and the other, in the general Command, has been proved to be the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, and &s;uch a Bapti&s;m as accompanies, or is the Effect of Chri&s;t's true Min&s;ters teaching or preaching the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THESE Things con&s;idered, I doubt not but we are in the Judgment of every unprejudiced Reader, &s;ufficiently freed from the Dilemma this Author would gladly bring us into, and all &s;eeming Contradictions fairly reconciled. For the Reader may &s;ee that the Ba&s;is or Foundation on which our Opponent's Ar|guments on this Head are built, is th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">amene&s;s of the Words bapti&s;ing and bapti&s;e, in the two Texts

of Scripture, <HI>Matthew</HI> xxviii. 19. and 1 <HI>Corinthians</HI> i. 17. But as it has been made appear by plain and expre&s;s Words in both Texts, that the Bapti&s;ms in tho&s;e Places are different, it removes his Pillar, and &s;o all his Arguments built thereon mu&s;t of Cour&s;e fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>BUT this Author has wre&s;ted <HI>Paul</HI>'s Meaning, 1 <HI>Corinthians</HI> i. by adding, Page 47, as tho' they had been <HI>Paul</HI>'s Words; 'I tell you that tho' I have Power to bapti&s;e, yet my chief Bu&s;ine&s;s is to preach the Go&s;pel to the Gentiles. And again after the &s;ame Man|ner, Page 48,

By this Rule of Con&s;truc|tion we may wre&s;t the Scriptures to our own De|&s;truction, and by making the in&s;pired Writers &s;ay what we plea&s;e, may pretend to prove the mo&s;t erro|neous Doctrine from thence.</P>
<P>THIS Author, like the poor ignorant <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman, de&s;cends to material Water upon the Words <HI>Appollos watereth,</HI> which &s;hews his Weakne&s;s, but being in a great Streight he will catch at any Thing that has the Name of Water: And &s;eeing he is &s;o in Love with Water I &s;hall furni&s;h him with &s;ome other Texts of Scripture in which Water is mentioned al&s;o, from whence the Reader may have an Opportunity to ob|&s;erve that we can prove a <HI>&s;piritual Water</HI> proceeding from <HI>the Well of Salvation</HI> that &s;hall be drawn with Joy; with which I apprehend <HI>Appollos</HI> watered as an In&s;trument; and which they who have once drank of &s;hall never thir&s;t after this Author's elementary Water, or go to him or any in his Spirit to draw. See <HI>John</HI> iv. 13, 14. <HI>Je&s;us an&s;wered unto her (the</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="007983_0048_102E0D541A901450" MS="y">
Samaritan) <HI>who&s;oever drinketh of this Water &s;hall thir&s;t again: But who&s;oever drinketh of the Water that I &s;hall give him &s;hall never thir&s;t; but the Water that I &s;hall give him &s;hall be in him a Well of Water &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting Life.</HI> And again, Chap. vii. Ver. 37. <HI>&amp;c. In the la&s;t Day, that great Day of the Fea&s;t, Je&s;us &s;tood and cried, &s;aying, if any Man thir&s;t let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath &s;aid, out of his Belly &s;hall flow Rivers of living Water. But this he &s;pake of the Spirit which they that believe on him &s;hould receive; for the Holy Gho&s;t was not yet given, becau&s;e that Je&s;us was not yet glorified.</HI> But it is evident that before the Time of <HI>Appollos</HI>'s watering the Church Je&s;us was glo|rified, and the Holy Gho&s;t given; and &s;o <HI>Appollos</HI> and the other Mini&s;ters, being Believers in Chri&s;t, watered the Church with living and &s;piritual Water. And this Author's endeavouring to render it elemen|tary Water is one of the weake&s;t Arguments that I ever &s;aw in Print on the Subject; and &s;o I &s;hall re|ject it as having no Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT now he &s;ays, Page 49, that <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> affords him another Argument to prove that <HI>Paul</HI>'s Words cannot be under&s;tood in the Sen&s;e he contends for: Becau&s;e he &s;ays that tho&s;e few bapti&s;ed by <HI>Paul</HI> were not bapti&s;ed by Virtue of his apo&s;tolic Com|mi&s;&s;ion, but rather in Conde&s;cen&s;ion to their Weak|ne&s;s, even as at another Time he circumci&s;ed <HI>Timothy.</HI> To which our Opponent &s;aith, it not being prohibit|ed, was a Matter of perfect Indifferency, and brings &s;ome Rea&s;ons for the Policy of it; but &s;aith, as &s;oon as it became a Que&s;tion of Importance and likely to be hurtful, then the Apo&s;tle declared again&s;t it. Now what this Author here &s;aith in Regard to Circumci&s;ion,
<PB N="44" REF="007983_0049_102E0D55B014A3B8">
may al&s;o be the Ca&s;e with Water Bapti&s;m. For, as that was not at that Time prohibited, it was a Mat|ter of Indifferency, and &s;ome of the &s;ame politic Rea&s;ons might be added, as of meeting with le&s;s Op|po&s;ition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o bapti&s;ing tho&s;e few mentioned by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> might be in Conde&s;cen&s;ion, and not by Virtue of his apo&s;tolic Commi&s;&s;ion; but when he &s;aw &s;o bad U&s;e made of Water Bapti&s;m, that they di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the Name of tho&s;e who bapti&s;ed them, and that it was likely to cau&s;e Divi|&s;ions in the Church, it was high Time to take them down a little, and no better Way could this be done than to le&s;&s;en their Thoughts of that Ceremony on which they &s;o valued them&s;elves, and to tell them plainly that Chri&s;t &s;ent him not to bapti&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that he thanked God that he had bapti&s;ed &s;o few of them.</P>
<P>HE &s;eems to be offended with <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> Page 50, and &s;ays, but it is in&s;i&s;ted on with great Po&s;itivene&s;s, that the Text, <HI>Matthew</HI> xxviii. 19. is not to be under&s;tood of bapti&s;ing with Water; and that the Form of bapti&s;ing in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, hath <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Warrant from the Text. To which he &s;aith, when the foregoing Proofs, that the Text <HI>Matthew</HI> 28. is to be under&s;tood of a Water Bapti&s;m, are an&s;wered, then he will believe the&s;e po&s;itive A&s;&s;er|&s;ions, and not before.</P>
<P>ROBERT BARCLAY indeed doth &s;ay, in Page 434,
<Q>That this Scripture is not to be under&s;tood of bap|ti&s;ing with Water; and that the Form of bapti&s;ing in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, hath no Warrant from <HI>Matthew</HI> xxviii. 19.</Q> And this Author accu&s;eth him of de|parting
<PB N="45" REF="007983_0050_102E0D58073A4010" MS="y">
from his own Maxim, laid down not to go from the literal Signification of the Text, without &s;ome urgent Nece&s;&s;ity forceth thereto; but he thinks that <HI>Barclay</HI> has broke this Rule, becau&s;e he argues that the Name of the Lord is often taken in Scrip|ture for &s;omething el&s;e than a bare Sound of Words or literal Expre&s;&s;ion, even for his Virtue and Power, as may appear from <HI>P&s;alm</HI> liv. 3. <HI>Canticles</HI> i. 3. <HI>Proverbs</HI> xviii. 3. and in many other Places. But as this cannot be denied, &s;o I cannot &s;ee how <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> has gone from the literal Signification of the Text; and if this Author will keep &s;o well to the Text as <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> has done, and prove Water Bapti&s;m an In&s;titution of Chri&s;t, as a &s;tanding Ordi|nance in his Church, by that Text, <HI>Matthew</HI> xxviii. then I &s;hall yeild the Argument to him. But this he cannot do, and yet will be carping at &s;omething, if it be only to amu&s;e others, without the lea&s;t Proof; for he will find it harder to keep to the literal Sig|nification of that Text and prove Water there men|tioned, than we &s;hall to prove the Holy Gho&s;t there mentioned, which has been already done.</P>
<P>AS to the Bapti&s;m which <HI>Barclay</HI> contends for, into the Virtue and Power of the Father, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this Author &s;ays if it means any Thing; it mu&s;t be a being endowed with the Virtue and Power of that Per&s;on into whom you are bapti&s;ed, which he thinks mu&s;t &s;ignify to work Miracles, and if this is not the Mean|ing of the Words he confe&s;&s;es he does not under&s;tand the Meaning of them. Now if he will plea&s;e to read <HI>Matthew</HI> v. 48. he will find that Chri&s;t has &s;aid, <HI>Be ye perfect even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect;</HI> and how this Perfection can be attained without the Virtue and Power of the Father I cannot
<PB N="46" REF="007983_0051_102E0D599DE71EF0" MS="y">
&s;ee: Neither can any partake of the Virtue and Power of the Father but &s;uch as are bapti&s;ed with the Holy Gho&s;t, for it is thereby every Chri&s;tian becomes Members of the Body or Church of Chri&s;t, or in other Words, Branches of him who is the true Vine, this appears to be <HI>Robert Barclay</HI>'s Meaning.</P>
<P>AS to what he calls a very &s;trong Argument, Page 52, deduced from <HI>Robert Barclay</HI>'s own Words, to prove that the Text <HI>Matthew</HI> xxviii. mu&s;t mean a Water Bapti&s;m, this Author allows that the Apo&s;tles did mi&s;take that Part of their Commi&s;&s;ion in Regard to teaching all Nations, but agrees that as God was plea&s;ed in &s;o particular a Manner to remove their Mi&s;take in that Re&s;pect, he certainly would have &s;et them right as to the other Part of their Commi&s;&s;ion which related to bapti&s;ing, if they had mi&s;taken the Meaning of it. It may not be a-mi&s;s here to inform the Reader, that <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> &s;ays in the &s;ame Place which this Author is now carping at, Page 438,
<Q>It &s;ufficeth us that if they were &s;o mi&s;taken (tho' I &s;ay not that they were) they did not always re|main under that Mi&s;take, el&s;e <HI>Peter</HI> would not have &s;aid of the Bapti&s;m which now &s;aves, that it is not a putting away the Filth of the Fle&s;h, which certainly Water Bapti&s;m is.</Q>
To which I &s;hall add <HI>Paul</HI>'s declaring that Chri&s;t &s;ent him not to bap|ti&s;e, 1 <HI>Corinthians</HI> i. 17. which fully imports that &s;uch a Bapti&s;m, that he there makes Mention of, was not &s;aving; for we may &s;afely conclude, that if it had been &s;aving or conducive to the Salvation of the Soul the &s;ame would have been in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Com|mi&s;&s;ion. And as this Author has allowed before, that the Bapti&s;m alluded to by <HI>Paul</HI> mu&s;t be a Water Bapti&s;m, has &s;trengthened our Proofs, that if the
<PB N="47" REF="007983_0052_102E0D5CE13A7070" MS="y">
Apo&s;tles were once under &s;uch a Mi&s;take concerning Water Bapti&s;m, that their Mi&s;take was removed, and their Judgments &s;o clearly informed that they have left many full Proofs in Scripture that the one &s;aving Bapti&s;m is that of the Spirit and not elemen|tary Water, which neither this Author nor any other have been ever able to prove.</P>
<P>AND &s;o his high Charge, Page 53, again&s;t <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> of calling the Veracity and Truth of God in Que&s;tion, which, to heighten, he compares to the Sin which is not to be forgiven, may be urged with more Force again&s;t him than again&s;t <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> and the Quakers: And he had Need to pray for him&s;elf as well as others.</P>
<P>NOW as to his Rea&s;on which he calls a prudential one, which is of &s;o great Weight with him, when it is examined the Reader may judge whether it has any Weight at all in it: Since it cannot with any Rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed that Chri&s;t has left his Church at &s;uch Uncertainties in &s;o important and e&s;&s;ential a Point, as he ob&s;erves him&s;elf, in his &s;econd Page, this of Bapti&s;m is, le&s;t we &s;hould be to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine; but that we may be ready to give an An&s;wer to every Man that a&s;keth us a Rea&s;on of the Hope that is in us: But this prudential Rea&s;on would leave us in Uncertainties. And that it cannot be a Sin to u&s;e Water Bapti&s;m becau&s;e the Apo&s;tles u&s;ed it, and <HI>Peter</HI> commanded it; the &s;ame Argument might be u&s;ed with as much Force for Circumci&s;ion and the other <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Ceremonies to be continued: But the Danger of Sin in this Ca&s;e of Water Bapti&s;m lies in this, that altho' it was good in its Time as a Figure of the Sub&s;tance, even as the brazen Serpent was a
<PB N="48" REF="007983_0053_102E0D5E77A6EED8">
Figure of Chri&s;t, yet now by People's putting a Dependance in that for Salvation, and laying hold of the Shadow, they thereby neglect the Sub&s;tance and are left wandering at Uncertainties. As to what this Author &s;aith in the remaining Part of Page 54, it can be of no Force again&s;t us, neither has it any Shew of Rea&s;on, being built upon his u&s;ual Foun|dation of po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion without Proof. And ob&s;erve his A&s;&s;ertions:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, That Water Bapti&s;m is a po&s;itive Command of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2d, That it is one of the Conditions of eternal Sal|vation.</P>
<P N="3">3d, That Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed to accompany it with his divine Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P N="4">4th, That <HI>Peter</HI> has declared the Effects of it upon the Soul, <HI>viz.</HI> That by it we &s;hall obtain Remi&s;&s;ion of our Sins.</P>
<P N="5">5th, That the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t is cea&s;ed, Page 52.</P>
<P N="6">6th, That the Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Part. And,</P>
<P N="7">7th, That the Bapti&s;m with Water is the le&s;s nece&s;|&s;ary Part, Page 34.</P>
<P>WHICH if thou can&s;t reconcile, Reader, it is more than I can do.</P>
<P>BUT now as he draws towards a Conclu&s;ion he would, I &s;uppo&s;e, be under&s;tood that God has in&s;ti|tuted, by his Son, a Water Bapti&s;m which wa&s;hes the mo&s;t inveterate and malignant Di&s;ea&s;es of the Soul; but adds, by Virtue of the divine Pre&s;ence of the great Author and Mediator of a new Covenant, and the &s;anctifying Graces of his holy Spirit accompany|ing the due Admini&s;tration thereof: Which, with|out
<PB N="49" REF="007983_0054_102E0D6187FEFB58">
he can make a Divorce between the &s;anctifying Graces of the Holy Spirit and the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t, mu&s;t center in this, that the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Part: And then as he &s;ays that has long ago cea&s;ed, his Building at la&s;t is but a mere Babel Tower. But as to that Virtue which he talks of being in Water Bapti&s;m, the Multitude of unclean&s;ed Souls who have pa&s;&s;ed thro' that Admini&s;tration are mo&s;t irrefutable Evi|dences of its being an Application of no Value: And how con&s;i&s;tent it is with the evangelical Di&s;pen&s;ation to &s;uppo&s;e that Chri&s;t commanded a Duty and the Ser|vice thereof never appear, I leave to the judicious to determine.</P>
<P>AS to his Impartiality here boa&s;ted of, I have proved the Contrary by a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence, <HI>viz.</HI> his fre|quent Perver&s;ions and Additions, of not only <HI>Robert Barclay</HI>'s Writings, but al&s;o of the Scriptures of Truth, and I think that he would do well in Time to repent for his adding to the Words of the Te&s;timony of Truth which was &s;poken under the Influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, in that Ca&s;e of <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<P>AND now I &s;hall leave it to the judicious and impar|tial Reader to determine whether this Author has either &s;tated or vindicated the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> upon the important Point of Bapti&s;m; &s;eeing he has wholly pa&s;&s;ed over that of Infants, the mo&s;t u&s;ual Practice of that Church, or whether he has an&s;wered our Objections again&s;t Water Bapti&s;m in General.</P>
