that certain debts, including the &s;aid certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, but not naming or de&s;cribing the &s;ame, were redeemable and payable, when no fund was, by law, provided for paying the &s;ame; thereby committing a high mi&s;demeanor, mi&s;leading the other officers of government, and cau&s;ing money, without a previous appropriation, to be drawn from the trea&s;ury in violation of the con&s;titution.</P>
