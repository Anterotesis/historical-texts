<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT has long &s;ince been ob&s;erved that error is wont to be found in the extreams; as in all the com|mon affairs of life, &s;o in matters of religion.</P>
<P>Thus while &s;ome have made too light of original &s;in, as tho' mankind by it were merely &s;ufferers, as chil|dren when born poor, by the parents having &s;pent his &s;ub&s;tance. Others, to avoid that extream, have made too much of it, as tho' mankind, by it, were become utterly uncapable of any kind of goodne&s;s in any &s;en&s;e, even of the lowe&s;t &s;ort, called by the name of negative or comparative goodne&s;s, a being on the whole le&s;s wicked by any reformations and amendments, po&s;&s;ible while unregenerate.</P>
<P>So while &s;ome have maintained the doctrine of gene|ral redemption, in its utmo&s;t extent, that Chri&s;t died for all men alike, as much in all re&s;pects for Judas as for Peter. Others, to avoid that extream, deny his death to have any res;pect at all but to the elect only.</P>
<P>Again, while &s;ome maintain that the good works of the &s;aints are the matter of their ju&s;tification before God; others, to avoid that extream, make no account at all of good works, neither bold them&s;elves obliged to make the law the rule of life.</P>
<P>So, while &s;ome have carried a common work of the &s;pirit, ordinarily preparatory to that which is &s;aving, where a &s;aving work is wrought, too high, bordering on the fruits of a regenerating charge, or have been
<PB N="ii" REF="010691_0004_0F81E2C5D4AEEFE8">
too particular and exact in de&s;cribing the parts of it; others, to avoid that extream, have intirely di&s;carded any common work of the &s;pirit at all, on the unrege|nerate, &s;ome peremptorily denying any &s;uch thing as the influence of the &s;pirit on the unregenerate; others a&s;|&s;erting that nothing of that nature cap be proved from the holy &s;criptures. This brings to my thoughts a pa&s;|&s;age which I take to be credibly handed down, taken in &s;hort-hand from a &s;ermon preached by the famous Mr. Stoddard, as what he was much per&s;uaded of, viz. that when mini&s;ters left off preaching up a pre|paratory work as ordinarily previous to what is &s;av|ing, it might be looked upon as a token of the with|drawment of the &s;pirit of grace in its &s;aving opera|tions. The grounds of this per&s;ua&s;ion, as I take it, may be thus explained: So long as a &s;aving work is carried on in the hearts of mini&s;ters &amp; people, mini&s;ters will be compelled to know there is &s;uch a thing as a common work of the &s;pirit in the unregenerate, as a|bove, and will preach it up to their people without a monitor; therefore when they cea&s;e to do this, pa&s;&s;ing it over in &s;ilence as a mere mi&s;take entertained by &s;ome of the fathers, otherwi&s;e well-meaning and good men, it mu&s;t needs be a token that &s;uch &s;aving operations of the &s;pirit are wanting among them, I heartily fall in with this &s;entiment; and doubt not if inquiry were wade where mini&s;ters are inclined prevalently to doubt of this truth, it would be found that no &s;aving work hath for &s;ome time been remarkably and powerfully carried on among their people; and that if ever it be,
<PB N="iii" REF="010691_0005_0F81E2C744E07190">
it will afford abundant matter of conviction to all, that the &s;pirit convinces of &s;in, before it convinces of righteou&s;ne&s;s, even while under the reigning power of unbelief; of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not on me; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Joh.</HI> xvi. 8.</NOTE> that &s;inners are wounded and &s;lain by the law, before they are healed by the go&s;pel. Accordingly I take leave to recommend it, as worthy to be had in re|membrance with the ri&s;ing generation, but e&s;pecially with the mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, while &s;ome thro' fond &s;elf-love, the &s;trength of imagination, and the &s;ubtle workings of the adver|&s;ary, have fal&s;ely boa&s;ted their conver&s;ion and high at|tainmems in communion with God; others, to avoid that extream, have been induced to entertain low thoughts of all preten&s;ions to conver&s;ion, and even to call in que&s;tion the nece&s;&s;ity of any change called by the name of regeneration, &s;ave what is wrought by or at bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>In like manner; while &s;ome have made too much of the doings of the unregenerate, awakened to a diligent attendance on the means of grace, and to reformation and amendment of life, as tho' there were &s;omething in the&s;e things holy, &s;piritual and plea&s;ing to God, &s;ome|thing that &s;tood in connexion with promi&s;es, or that might recommend to God's &s;pecial favour, as a rea&s;on why it is be&s;towed, Others, to avoid that extream, have made all po&s;i&s;ible improvements and attainments of the unregenerate, how much &s;oever awakened and re|formed, quite nothing; not only in point ju&s;tifica|tion
<PB N="iv" REF="010691_0006_0F81E2C7DC6E0BB0">
and acceptance with God, and in all the re&s;pects abovementioned; but as to being thereby a whit le&s;s &s;in|ful, or more in the way of duty or mercy, than they would have been going on &s;ecure in their &s;ins, under the &s;ame external means of light. Again,</P>
<P>Others, in order to be at a &s;till greater remove from the extream above, maintain that the unregenerate are by all po&s;&s;ible awakening convictions and amendments of life, on the whole undoubtedly more vile than they would have been continuing &s;ecure and going on in their &s;ins, under the &s;ame external means of light; and yet at the &s;ame time allow, that on the &s;ingle account of &s;pe|tulative knowledge obtained in attendance on means, they are more likely to obtain &s;alvation. The former repre&s;ents the awakened reformed &s;inner as being neither le&s;s &s;inful or more likely to be &s;aved, than the profane profligate; the latter, as being (on the whole) more vile and odious to God; but more likely to be &s;aved: Both which, to me, appear to be extreams. 'Tis the latter of the&s;e that here falls under con&s;ideration; which I take to be clearly held forth in the tenth &s;ecti|on referred to.</P>
<P>It is now &s;ome time &s;ince a &s;mall piece was publi&s;h|ed by me, in the way of refutation of what was then wrote in favour of the oppo&s;ite extream, and in defence of a &s;ermon preached by the Rev'd Mr. Samuel Cooke; which, according to my weak ability, was attempted in &s;uch a manner as might guard again&s;t this its oppo&s;ite extream, by leaving proper &s;criptural encouragement to a diligent attendance on the means of grace.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="010691_0007_0F81E2C89E5C4EF0">It was therefore no &s;mall gratification to me, when I under&s;tood that Mr. Hopkins had undertook the &s;ame cau&s;e, in an&s;wer to Dr. Mayhew, in which I had been concerned; and more &s;o, when the an&s;wer it&s;elf appeared to me a fini&s;hed debate on that point; for which Mr. Hopkins has my hearty thanks.</P>
<P>So that the matter of controver&s;y between Mr. Hop|kins and my&s;elf has no relation properly to his di&s;pute with the Doctor, but to the latter of the two la&s;t ex|treams abovementioned; the former of which, as con|&s;iderable, among other points, has more lately been the occa&s;ion, or cau&s;e of &s;preading confu&s;ion through towns, &s;ocieties and churches, and, it is to be feared, of &s;ome degree of alienation of affection between mini&s;ters and chri&s;tian brethren.</P>
<P>What is here boa&s;ted by &s;ome that maintain this point, is, that this performance of Mr. Hopkins is a full vindication of it. But this is carrying the mat|ter too far. All that can, with truth, be boa&s;ted of this performance in their favour is, that it maintains a part of their tenet, viz. that the awakened reform|ed &s;inner, how much &s;oever he is &s;o, is not a whit le&s;s vile in the &s;ight of God than he would be had he con|tinued in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, abandoning him&s;elf to all manner of mo&s;t abominable wickedne&s;s, under the &s;ame external means of light.</P>
<P>This principle, it mu&s;t be owned, Mr. Hopkins has given unwearied labour to e&s;tabli&s;h; &s;ince, as often as he a&s;&s;erts or e&s;&s;ays to prove, that the awakened reformed &s;inner, how much &s;oever he is &s;o, is, on the whole, more vile, &amp;c. He does,
<PB N="vi" REF="010691_0008_0F81E2C95F27F7A8">
with a high hand, maintain, that he is not, le&s;s vile; &s;ince the &s;inner can't, on the whole, be more and le&s;s vile at the &s;ame time. Thus far Mr. Hopkins is one with that party.</P>
<P>'Tis very ob&s;ervable here, whatever the author's de&s;ign might, be, that many who are not friends to Calvini&s;m, glory in the&s;e things. This, &s;ay they, is that Calvini&s;m that has made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the worlds and now at la&s;t is brought forth in|to the light. They glory in what I have called the two ex|treams, la&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>I appeal to the judicious reader, &mdash; Is there no in&s;uperable difficulties attending the admi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e things? Can they ever be explained to the under&s;tanding and edification of weak, yet &s;incere Chri&s;tians? Can the go&s;pel-way of holine&s;s, admiting the&s;e metaphy&s;ical Subtleties, ever be made plain for the dear lambs of Chri&s;t's flock, the weak, the feeble, the lame; &s;o that the way-faring men, the <HI>Fools,</HI> i.e. of weak under&s;tanding, &s;hall not err?</P>
<P>However the que&s;tion in hand, is not what the Arminians &s;ay of the&s;e things; what party the author de&s;igned to take up for; but whether the things advanced are contained in the ho|ly &s;criptures. And here, as I doubt not they were, by this author, apprehended to be agreeable to the word of God; &s;o, on the other hand, whether it be my weakne&s;s or otherwi&s;e, God knoweth, to me they appeared &s;trange and un&s;criptural; at lea&s;t left dark and very liable to exception. Nor have I been able to &s;atisfy my&s;elf by what is offered in their confirma|tion.</P>
<P>'Tis objected by &s;ome, and I doubt not innocently, that Mr. Hopkins has di&s;charged him&s;elf well in the debate between the doctor and him, and therefore 'tis pity there &s;hould be any re|ply in that ca&s;e. I heartily join with them had he &s;topt there. But then it is evident there is another di&s;pute carried on that is quite di&s;tinct from that, and has no certain connection with
<PB N="vii" REF="010691_0009_0F81E2CA1E1DEA48">
it, as hinted above and will be further &s;een in the following di&s;cour&s;e. I forbear to trouble the rea|der with a train of objections revolved in my own mind, &s;uch as my great aver&s;ion to publick debates in divinity, unle&s;s duty &s;o require; the unfitne&s;s of my advanced age, attended with much of infirmity; the preciou&s;ne&s;s of time for more delightful im|provement; my esteem of the author who&s;e &s;entiments are here oppo&s;ed. The&s;e and the like, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, are of no &s;mall moment. But then, on the other hand, when I con&s;ider the cau&s;e of God and truth, the contentions and divi&s;ions that have happened in many places, at lea&s;t in part by what this author &s;trenuou&s;ly maintains; and that nothing hath beon pub|lickly &s;aid on the other &s;ide; and how naturally men go from one step of error to another. In this view of things, while &s;ome rejoice in the&s;e new di&s;coveries, as being of that excellence whereby 'tis &s;aid the go&s;pel was never before preached with &s;uch clearne&s;s, &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles as now; others, perhaps by far the greater number, and &s;uch as have hitherto, been looked upon as pillars in the church, are &s;ad, as being al|together to &s;eek for any clear &s;cripture-evidence that the things advanced are true; and in the mean time many our younger brethren in the mini&s;try &s;tanding in a pau&s;e, not know|ing where to fix, earne&s;tly de&s;ire the &s;ubject may be further touched upon, in hope of light: I have &s;uffered my&s;elf, though with much reluctancy, to be prevailed on to make the following humble attempt; not that I have once imagined my&s;elf (under the infirmities and decays of advanced age,) equal to the more &s;prightly genius of younger years, or able to give the cau&s;e that full advantage that truth would allow; yet ths goodne&s;s and importance of the cau&s;e, as things appear to me, my near ap|proach to the great and invi&s;ible world, when I &s;hall take final leave of the dear church of God upon earth, per&s;uades me,
<PB N="viii" REF="010691_0010_0F81E2CAD855CC20">
rather than &s;it &s;till in &s;ilence, to &s;hew my good-will, by ca&s;t|ing in, tho' but my &s;ingle mite.</P>
<P>In this view, the reader is de&s;ired to pa&s;s with candour what in the manner of compo&s;ure might be di&s;gustful to the po|lite; e&s;pecially repetitions with &s;ome variety of expre&s;&s;ion in|dulged for the &s;ake of reaching with conviction the weake&s;t unders&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I a&s;k leave to conclude nearly with the words of my dear I brother&mdash;If I have made any dangerous mi&s;take in the fol|lowing di&s;cour&s;e, and it &s;hall be pointed out by &s;ome wi&s;e judicious pen, I &s;hall most gladly &s;tand corrected before the world.</P>

<P>I. The pa&s;&s;ages quoted from the author's own words are as follow.</P>
<P><Q>The impenitent &s;inner who continues ob&s;tinate|ly to reject and oppo&s;e the &s;alvation offered in the go&s;pel, does in &s;ome re&s;pects, yea, <HI>on the whole,</HI> become not <HI>le&s;s</HI> but <HI>more vicious</HI> and guilty in God's &s;ight, the more in&s;truction and knowledge he gets in attendance on the means of grace.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 124.</NOTE> Yea, his impenitence and all his &s;ins are &s;o aggravated by the light and conviction he obtains, that whatever
<PB N="2" REF="010691_0012_0F81E2CE74991A68">
particular ways of known &s;in he has for&s;aken, and how many &s;oever external duties he attends upon; yet, on the whole, he is undoubtedly a greater &s;inner, than he was when he lived in &s;e|curity and the neglect of the means of grace.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">125.</NOTE> So that the impenitent unregenerate &s;inner does not grow better, but rather grows wor&s;e by all the in&s;truction and knowledge he gets in the u&s;e of means. And awakened convinced &s;inners with whom mo&s;t means are u&s;ed, and who are mo&s;t attentive to the concerns of their &s;ouls, and mo&s;t in earne&s;t in the u&s;e of means, are commonly, if not always, really more guilty in God's &s;ight, than they that are &s;ecure and at ea&s;e in their &s;ins.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><Q>Sinners who continue impenitent under the greate&s;t conviction of con&s;cience, and the mo&s;t concern about their &s;ouls and &s;alvation, and are con&s;equently taking the mo&s;t pains and u&s;ing un|wearied endeavours, are u&s;ually the greate&s;t &s;in|nes, <HI>really more vicious, more guilty and vile,</HI> than they were when in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, and lived in a great <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> in the neglect of the means of grace. So that the good the &s;inner gets by a con&s;tant attendance on the means of grace, while impenitent, is not a becoming on the whole, le&s;s vicious or criminal in God's &s;ight.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 127.</NOTE> The &s;inner's growing really wor&s;e, more guilty and vile the more light he has, and the greater advantages
<PB N="3" REF="010691_0013_0F81E2CF173112A0">
he enjoys, while he continues impenitent, is real|ly no matter of di&s;couragement,</Q> &amp;c.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 143.</NOTE></P>
<P>II. In order to bring the matter into a narrower compa&s;s, and &s;um up the whole in one general propo&s;ition, whereby the &s;en&s;e of the author, &s;o far as concerns the pre&s;ent debate, may more clearly be &s;een, I de&s;ire the following particulars may be carefully ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. That when it is here &s;aid, the <HI>awakened re|formed</HI> &s;inner is <HI>more vile</HI> in the &s;ight of God, than when in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, it can't be meant only in the &s;en&s;e in which all, even &s;aints, considered in them&s;elves, as well as &s;inners, are more vile to|day than ye&s;terday, as they are con&s;tantly adding fre&s;h guilt; but that an awakened reformed &s;tate is, ON THE WHOLE, a more &s;inful &s;tate than that of a &s;e|cure &s;inner, i. e. they are more vile than they would have been had they continued &s;ecure, going on in their &s;ins. Nor,</P>
<P N="2">2. Can any thing be meant by the&s;e and the like expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by the author, viz. <Q>The &s;inner's continuing ob&s;tinately to reject and oppo&s;e the &s;alvation offered in the go&s;pel,</Q> but only his con|tinuing unregenerate under all that conviction; as is manife&s;t from the author's own conce&s;&s;ion,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 124.</NOTE> <Q>and will continue to do &s;o, until a new heart be given in regeneration.</Q> Nor,</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it here &s;aid the awakened &s;inner will be more vile and odious to God, when the influence of
<PB N="4" REF="010691_0014_0F81E2CF5B70DB48">
conviction abates, and he returns to his evil cour&s;es; but in the then pre&s;ent ten&s;e he is' i. e. under the height of all his convictions, reformations and a|mendments of life; and under the common influ|ences of the &s;pirit, While he thinks there is at lea&s;t a may-be God will be gracious. Nor,</P>
<P N="4">4. Is he &s;aid to be a greater &s;inner only in a re|&s;pect as his impenitence is continued under greater light; but 'on the whole.' Nor,</P>
<P N="5">5. Is it only &s;aid that the awakened convinced &s;inner may be a greater &s;inner; but that he is, be|yond all peradventure, undoubtedly &s;o; i. e. con|&s;tantly and unavoidably: So that what is here &s;aid is of the nature of a general propo&s;ition. Nor,</P>
<P N="6">6. Is this more &s;inful &s;tate of awakened &s;inners affirmed only in ca&s;e the &s;ins for&s;aken are of a le&s;s heinous nature, but on &s;uppo&s;ition they are ever &s;o gro&s;s and enormous, <Q>whatever particular ways of known &s;in, he has for&s;aken,</Q> &amp;c. Nor,</P>
<P N="7">7. Are the convictions of awakened &s;inners, here &s;poken of under any re&s;triction or limitation, but whatever be the degree, <Q>though under the greate&s;t convictions of con&s;cience, and the mo&s;t concern about their &s;ouls,</Q> &amp;c. The author indeed begins with what he calls <HI>in&s;truction,</HI> explained by <HI>&s;pecu|lative knowledge,</HI> and then adds what he terms <HI>more</HI> than <HI>&s;peculation,</HI> and finally ri&s;es to <HI>all that convic|tion</HI> that the unregenerate are capable of, while &s;uch. P. 121&mdash;124.</P>
<P N="8">8. All this is &s;aid of the &s;tate of the awakened
<PB N="5" REF="010691_0015_0F81E2D0191CC1B8">
compared with that of the &s;ecure &s;inner, under the &s;ame go&s;pel and means of external light.</P>
<P>A due regard had to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the plain &s;en&s;e of the author may be compri&s;ed in this gene|ral propo&s;ition, viz. <Q>That on every ri&s;ing degree of in|ternal light, awakening, conviction and amend|ment of life, found in any of the unregenerate, while &s;uch, they are undoubtedly (on the whole) more vile, odious and abominable in God's &s;ight, than they would have been had they continued at ea&s;e, going on in their &s;ins, under the &s;ame external means of light.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus, to the be&s;t of my under&s;tanding, fairly adju&s;ted, &s;tated, and &s;um'd up the &s;en&s;e of the author, I mu&s;t &s;ay the divinity here exhibited appears to me &s;trange and new, never before advan|ced in the Chri&s;tian world by any divine of tolera|ble &s;en&s;e and reputation, &s;o far as my acquaintance reacheth; unle&s;s &s;omething of a like complexion is to be found in the Letters on THERON and ASPA|SIO, a&s;cribed to SANDIMAN, who has well-nigh, condemned all other divines to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf and his party as the only true Church of Chri&s;t upon earth, which, it is &s;aid, hath for many ages been concealed in the wilderne&s;s, but now lately hath, ap|peared in them; agreeable to other enthu&s;ia&s;tick vi&s;ionaries.</P>

things which God commands, and of good u&s;e both to them&s;elves and others; yet, becau&s;e they proceed not from an heart purified by faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word, nor to a right end, the glory of God; they are therefore &s;inful and cannot plea&s;e God, or make a man meet to receive grace from God.

<P>After the te&s;timony of &s;o many calvini&s;tick di|vines, I need quote no more, unle&s;s the late pre&s;i|dent Edwards, who will &s;erve, I &s;uppo&s;e, in&s;tead of many with our author, and who is &s;o expre&s;s to

the point as if he had wrote on purpo&s;e to confute the doc|trine I am oppo&s;ing. <Q>Such things, &s;ays he,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ident Edwards on virtue. p. 180, 181.</NOTE> have a negative moral goodne&s;s in them, becau&s;e a being with|out them would be an evidence of a much greater mo|ral evil. Thus, the exerci&s;e of natural con&s;cience in &s;uch and &s;uch degrees, wherein appears &s;uch a mea&s;ure of an awakening or &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cince, tho' it be not of the nature of real po&s;itive virtue, or true moral goodne&s;s (that is &s;aving grace) yet has a negative moral goodne&s;s; becau&s;e in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, it is an evidence of the ab&s;ence of that higher degree of wickedne&s;s which cau&s;es great in&s;en&s;ibility or &s;tupidity of Con&s;cience.</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Divines indeed of the be&s;t character and greate&s;t note have allowed, that &s;inners under deep and genuine convictions, conver&s;ing more &s;en&s;ibly with the wicked|ne&s;s of their own hearts and lives, have been ready to look on them&s;elves as greater &s;inners than heretofore, yea perhaps as growing daily wor&s;e, and more hard hearted. However to be &s;en&s;ible of &s;in and to realize and feel their own badne&s;s is one thing, and to grow really more hard|ned and &s;tupid is another very different from the former, &s;o that the one may be without the other.</P>
<P>But that they really do grow wor&s;e from the fir&s;t de|gree of internal light and &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience; where|by they become all attention to the concerns of their &s;al|vation, tremble at pa&s;t &s;ins, reform known evils, and with great concern attend on all known duties; that in this ca&s;e they are in the &s;tate of their mind really more vile, odious and abominable in the &s;ight of God, than when &s;ecure indulging them&s;elves in all manner of wickedne&s;s, under the &s;ame external means of light, is quite new. And therefore requires the greater caution, not to admit, of

other than clear clear and demon&s;trative &s;cripture evidence and proof for the confirmation of it. To the law and to the te&s;timony; if they &s;peak according to this word, we &s;hall gladly receive it; but if not we are &s;ure there is no light, or truth in it. I proceed,</P>
<P>III. To inquire into the proof offered in confirmation of this point; where we have &s;everal texts of &s;cripture al|ledged, as John iii. 19. <Q>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved dark|ne&s;s rather than light.</Q> &s;o John xv. 22, 24. <Q>If I had not come and &s;poken to them, they had not had &s;in.</Q> and Mat. xi. 20, 24. <Q>Then began he to upbraid the cities in which mo&s;t of his mighty works were done; becau&s;e they repented not. Woe unto thee Chorazin; woe un|to thee Beth&s;aida: for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal texts improved in confirmation of this new doctrine.</P>
<P>I begin with the fir&s;t, <Q>This is the condemnation that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light.</Q></P>
<P>What is &s;aid by the author to enforce the pertinency of this text to prove his point, is, <Q>our &s;aviour repre&s;ents the light which men have as that which does in a pecu|liar manner, and above every thing el&s;e aggravate the &s;in and condemnation of tho&s;e that rebel again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P>It is clearly held forth in the&s;e words, that light is come into the world, that men have preferred darkne&s;s to it, and are thereby expo&s;ed to a more aggravated con|demnation. All this is readily conceeded; but what is it to the author's purpo&s;e, or, what would it be, &s;hould we take in all him&s;elf hath &s;aid upon the text; and ex|plain it in a &s;cripture &s;en&s;e? that is under&s;tand by it the
<PB N="9" REF="010691_0019_0F81E2D51E5A9D58">
external light of the evidence of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and &s;o of the truth of the go&s;pel in which &s;en&s;e Chri&s;t hath taught us to under&s;tand it; when he &s;aith <Q>if I had not done among them, the works which none other man did, they had not had &s;in.</Q> As if Chri&s;t had &s;aid, if I had not &s;et before them the external light of the evidence of my divine mi&s;&s;ion, in an objective way, in the works I did, they had not had that &s;in of rejecting that light; <Q>but now have they both &s;een, and hated both me and my father.</Q> As if Chri&s;t had &s;aid, they hated that light objectively &s;et before them, in my works, in which my divinity, and in mine the divinity of the father objectively &s;hone forth.</P>
<P>But what does all this relate to a convinced, reformed &s;inner? thou&s;ands and millions may have re|jected this light with &s;coff and deri&s;ion, whereby they have been expo&s;ed to a more aggravated condemnation; and not one of them the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent debate: becau&s;e not awakened to any &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience, or amendment of life.</P>
<P>Not a word of an awakened reformed &s;inner in the text or context, nothing of internal light, or &s;en&s;ibility of con|&s;cience, or of any of the effects, that might imply it: nay the character here given, of tho&s;e &s;poken of is quite the rever&s;e of an awakened, reformed &s;inner, they are &s;aid to practice evil, i. e. &s;o as the reformed &s;inner does not and to &s;hun the light, left their evil deeds &s;hould be reproved, and they called to part with them.</P>
<P>How therefore this point can be argued from the text, that &s;ays nothing about it, I mu&s;t leave, and pa&s;s to the &s;econd text alledged, viz. <Q>if I had not come and &s;pok|en to them they had not had &s;in.</Q> i. e. &s;ays the author, 'their &s;in would have been LITTLE OR NOTHING, com|pared with what it is now.'</P>

They indeed had it in their hearts; but it lay conceal'd, hid under the cloak of high preten|&s;ions to &s;anctity: but when they acted it out, the cloak fell off, and their wickedne&s;s appeared to all the world. Hence it is &s;aid, 'now have they no cloak for their &s;in. This acting out the wickedne&s;s of their hearts, we readi|ly grant, was an aggravation of their &s;in, but how comes it to pa&s;s, that all their &s;infulne&s;s of Heart and life whereby they were more vile than the Idolatrous heathen, and mo&s;t abominable Sodomites, is little, or nothing, compared with acting it out in this particular?

<P>I proceed to the third text propo&s;ed, viz. <HI>Woe unto thee Chorazin, Woe unto thee Beth&s;aida; for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes.</HI></P>

nor had this light and in&s;truction.</Q> What force there is in this text, and what is &s;aid by the author, the reader will be&s;t judge when the following particulars are duly con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is evident, that in the&s;e words a compari&s;on is made between the wickedne&s;s of Chorazin and Beth&s;aida, and that of Tyre and Sidon.</P>
<P N="2">2. That that in which their wickedne&s;s is compared and tryed, is the degree of obduracy of heart and &s;tu|pidity of con&s;cience, to which they had &s;everally reduced them&s;elves, by their own wickedne&s;s, whereby they were more unimpre&s;&s;ible, by proper motives and arguments, to repentance.</P>
<P N="3">3. The medium cho&s;en by our &s;aviour, for the trial and deci&s;ion of this point between them, is a &s;uppo|&s;ition of the &s;ame proper arguments and motives to re|pentance, &s;et in the &s;ame advantageous light before both.</P>
<P N="4">4. That on the trial of this &s;ingle point, omni&s;cience being judge, the deci&s;ion comes out again&s;t Chorazin and Beth&s;aida&mdash;<HI>If the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have re|pented long ago in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I take it for granted here that no more is intended by repentance than legal repentance, or repentance on natural principles, i. e. from natural con&s;cience greatly awakened to a &s;en&s;e of the maje&s;ty and per|fection of God, the evil de&s;ert of &s;in, and &s;en&s;e of God's wrath, at|tended with breaking off from their evil ways, like what, no doubt, was at lea&s;t more generally the repentance of Nineveh; &s;eeing our ble&s;&s;ed &s;aviour infinitely well knew, that neither tho&s;e means they en|joyed, nor any other as means, could ever bring them to a &s;aving re|pentance, without an almighty power exerted in giving a new heart.</NOTE> As if Chri&s;t had &s;aid, You have, by your own wickedne&s;s, wa&s;ted natural con&s;cience, &s;ined away your <HI>moral Sen&s;e,</HI> and rendered your&s;elves more unimpre&s;&s;ible, by the &s;ame motives and arguments to repentance, &s;et in the &s;ame advantageous

light, than the idolatrous Tyrians and Sidonians: and therefore on that &s;ingle account, your &s;tate is more wick|ed than theirs, and you ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to a more aggra|vated condemnation in the day of judgment than they. And now what is there in the&s;e words of our &s;aviour, that has any tendency to the author's purpo&s;e? Do they prove that &s;inners under the go&s;pel, awakened to a great degree of &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience, whatever be their a|mendment of life, while unregenerate are, on the whole, more wicked in the &s;tate of their mind, and so more o|dious to God, than when &s;ecure and at ea&s;e in their &s;ins? nay, &s;o far from it; that they prove quite the rever&s;e, viz. That the greater degree of their wickedne&s;s; is to be e&s;timated according to the greater degree of their &s;tupidity, obduracy and hardne&s;s of heart, under the &s;ame external means of grace, as in the in&s;tance above. This being clearly proved from the&s;e words of our &s;a|viour, which is the negative part of the que&s;tion, can contraries be proved from the &s;ame words? or can any art of metaphysical rea&s;oning rever&s;e what is determined by unerring wi&s;dom?</P>
<P>But to bring this matter to a clo&s;e, if any thing fur|ther needs to be &s;aid; I would argue thus;</P>
<P>If the author's point is evident from the&s;e texts, it mu&s;t be either from the increa&s;e of internal light in the con&s;cience, and the proper effects thereof; &s;uch, as a greater &s;en&s;ibility of divine things, of the maje&s;ty of God, of the ill de&s;ert of &s;in, fears of wrath, concern to e&s;cape it, reformations of known evils, &amp;c. con&s;idered in them&s;elves; or from the abu&s;e of this light, con|tinuing &s;till unregenerate under it. If it can be made evident at all from the&s;e texts, it mu&s;t be in one or the other of the&s;e ways, there being no other way con|ceivable, by which it may be done.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010691_0024_0F81E2D89DA3D460">What I &s;hall attempt therefore, &s;hall be to &s;hew, that it can't be done in either of the&s;e ways;</P>
<P N="1">1. Not from the increa&s;e of internal light of divine things let in upon natural con&s;cience, or any of its pro|per effects, as above: becau&s;e the&s;e, con&s;idered in them|&s;elves, can't render the &s;tate of the unregenerate more &s;inful than their ab&s;ence, under the &s;ame external means of light; but really le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>Thus a &s;en&s;ibility of divine things awakened in natural con&s;cience, by a greater degree of internal light, &s;urely cannot be more &s;inful than ignorance and &s;tupidity: &s;o fears of wrath thence ari&s;ing, concern to e&s;cape it, re|forming known evils and attending known duties. The&s;e con&s;idered in them&s;elves, can't be more &s;inful than their contraries, under the &s;ame external means of light.</P>
<P>This I take to be clearly held forth by a late celebra|ted writer, as quoted above, in the 5th page. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e we have the author's own conce&s;&s;ion, in the following words, <Q>Their greater &s;infulne&s;s does not indeed con&s;i&s;t in their concern about them&s;elves, in a &s;en&s;e of the &s;ad, dangerous &s;tate they are in, and in their earne&s;tly de&s;iring deliverance and &s;afety</Q> p. 126</P>
<P>Thus it appears, as I think, with the full conce&s;&s;ion of the author, that a &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience, as above con&s;idered in it&s;elf, can't render the &s;tate of the awaken|ed reformed &s;inner, more vile in the &s;ight of God, than that of a &s;ecure profligate, under the &s;ame external means of light. And therefore if the&s;e &s;criptures prove the au|thor's point at all, they mu&s;t prove that the abu&s;e of and &s;inning again&s;t this internal light of con&s;cience, is that which renders the &s;tate of the awakened &amp; reformed &s;inner more vile in the &s;ight of God, than that of a &s;ecure &s;inner.</P>
<P>But how can the&s;e texts prove this? &s;ince, as hath been ob&s;erved, they &s;ay nothing of the&s;e things, not a
<PB N="15" REF="010691_0025_0F81E2DA84D48AB0">
word of an awakened reformed &s;inner, nothing of in|ternal light and &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience; much le&s;s, if it were po&s;&s;ible, of awakened &s;inners being on the whole wor&s;e under all degrees of ri&s;ing convictions and refor|mation, than in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, at ea&s;e in their &s;ins. Thus all &s;hadow of proof of the author's point from the&s;e texts, &s;o far as I am able to di&s;cern, di&s;appears.</P>
<P>However the author goes on, by &s;uppo&s;ing a conce&s;|&s;ion in the&s;e Words. <Q>None will deny, I tru&s;t, that a living under the go&s;pel and enjoying the means of grace, is the occa&s;ion of aggravating the &s;in and con|demnation of tho&s;e who per&s;evere in their oppo&s;ition to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> And adds <Q>the go&s;pel proves unto them a &s;avour of death unto death.</Q> And then pro|ceeds to draw his conclu&s;ion; <Q>con&s;equently the more light and conviction men have, while they continue ob&s;tinately to oppo&s;e light and truth, and reject the offers of the go&s;pel,</Q> i. e. while they continue unre|generate, as the author explains him&s;elf, <Q>the more guilty and vile, and the greater criminals are they in God's &s;ight,</Q> whatever be their reformations of life, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus, from a train of rea&s;onings on a number of &s;a|cred texts, the principle in debate is <HI>&s;eemingly</HI> adduced as a con&s;equence. But is there one word of it contained in the premi&s;es? The&s;e texts indeed &s;peak of the external light of the evidence of the truth of the go&s;pel, objec|tively &s;et before the mind: but do they &s;ay one word of internal light, of awakening conviction, of great con|cern for &s;alvation, or of great reformation and amend|ment of life? Not a word. How therefore this con&s;e|quence &s;hould be drawn from the&s;e premi&s;es, I am not able to account.</P>
<P>I have thus gone through with the author's proof at large, that every reader might be under advantage to &s;ee
<PB N="16" REF="010691_0026_0F81E2DB403C9BA0">
and judge for him&s;elf. For my own part I am &s;o little acquainted with the rules of rea&s;oning, that I &s;hould think it a &s;ufficient an&s;wer on the whole, only to &s;ay, no con|&s;equence, and wait for light.</P>
<P>Were it ever &s;o fully conceded, that tho&s;e that peri&s;h from under the external light of the go&s;pel, do thereby fall under a more aggravated condemnation; yet this would be nothing to the author's purpo&s;e: becau&s;e this may be the ca&s;e with multitudes, that they reject the ex|ternal light of the evidence of the truth of the go&s;pel with &s;corn and deri&s;ion, without ever being awakened or reformed by it; &s;o the go&s;pel may be a &s;avour of death unto death unto thou&s;ounds that never were one of them a proper &s;ubject of this debate; becau&s;e never awakened to reformation and amendment of life.</P>
<P>The author's mi&s;take in the above rea&s;oning, as it ap|pears to me, ari&s;es chiefly from the want of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing well between the external light of the evidence of the truth of the go&s;pel, and the internal light of an awa|kened con&s;cience; arguing indifferently from one to the other, as tho' they were the &s;ame in nature, kind, ef|fects and properties; and in all re&s;pects would bear the &s;ame predications, rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions: whereas, tho' they agree in the &s;ame general nature, &s;o as to come under one and the &s;ame denomination or <HI>genus</HI>; yet do they e&s;&s;entially and &s;pecifically differ. The one is ex|ternal, objectively &s;et before the mind; the other is in|ternal and mental. The former is liable to be utterly rejected with contempt, without any influence upon the con&s;cience or life. The latter is received into the mind, and allowed by the author in this debate, to have great influence on both, to rai&s;e conviction, and excite reformation and amendment of life, to the highe&s;t degree the unregenerate are capable of by the common influen|ces
<PB N="17" REF="010691_0027_0F81E2DC44507248">
of the holy &s;pirit. And therefore to argue from the one to the other, as if they were the &s;ame; the rea&s;oning mu&s;t needs be inconclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>Again, another mi&s;taken way in which the author ar|gues his point, as it appears to me, is determining the degree of man's wickedne&s;s, meerly from the degree of light &s;inned again&s;t, without any regard had to the de|gree of the &s;trength of his bias to &s;in; which mu&s;t needs be inconclu&s;ive, for</P>
<P N="1">1. If this be &s;o, there could be no inequality of &s;inful|ne&s;s where there is equality of light &s;inned again&s;t; one could not be guilty of abu&s;ing the &s;ame degree of light more than another; or if he did, would not be more &s;inful; which can't be true. And therefore the rea&s;on|ing is un&s;ound. Can it once be doubted whether &s;ome men, under the &s;ame degree of light, natural or &s;uperna|tural, given up of God to vile affections, are not greater &s;inners, more vile and odious in God's &s;ight, than o|thers? Not becau&s;e they &s;in again&s;t greater degrees of light; but becau&s;e, with a higher hand, they abu&s;e and &s;in again&s;t the &s;ame degree of light. For in&s;tance, &s;up|po&s;e A. and B. are favour'd with equal degrees of light, and &s;uppo&s;e B. has three degrees of &s;trength of bias and inclination to &s;in, more than A. which there can be no rea&s;onable doubt may be the ca&s;e; can it once be doubt|ed here, whether B. is more vile and odious in God's &s;ight than A. &s;inning again&s;t the &s;ame degree of light? But what clears this point (if I mi&s;take not) beyond re|ply, is Chri&s;t's determination of Chorazin and Beth&s;aida's being greater &s;inners than Tyre and Sydon, on &s;uppo&s;i|tion their light and advantages had been equal, as above.</P>
<P>To this I might add, that on &s;uppo&s;ition the grand point on which the author &s;eems to lay the chief &s;tre&s;s of his argument, be fully conceded, viz. that he that &s;ins
<PB N="18" REF="010691_0028_0F81E2DD46B4CC00">
again&s;t a greater degree or light, is in that re&s;pect a greater &s;inner; will it thence follow that he is to on the whole? by no means, as &s;een above. Is it found rea|&s;oning to argue from a part to the whole; or from a particular circum&s;tance, to the whole &s;tate of the ca&s;e; termed by the &s;chools arguing a <HI>dicto &s;ecundum quid, ad dictum &s;impliciter?</HI> which, at be&s;t, is but &s;ophi&s;tical and inconclu&s;ive. I proceed to the</P>
<P N="4">IV. General head propo&s;ed, which was to offer &s;ome con&s;iderations in favour of the negative part of the que&s;|tion, viz. that the awakened reformed &s;inner, as above de&s;cribed, is not undoubtedly, on the whole, more vici|ous, in the &s;tate of his mind, and therefore not &s;o in God's &s;ight, than when &s;ecure, going on in his &s;ins. &mdash; This is what the following con&s;iderations are offered to e&s;tabli&s;h; and</P>
<P>i. The truth in hand may be argued from the ab&s;urdi|ties which admitting the affirmative part of the que&s;tion will unavoidably throw us into, as,</P>
<P N="1">1. If the principal advanced be true, there is no po&s;|&s;ibility of the profligate &s;inner's becoming le&s;s vicious, in the &s;tate of his mind, whatever be the wickedne&s;s he lives in the practice of, by any reformation of life, while unregenerate; becau&s;e reforming in any in&s;tance, &s;up|po&s;es the increa&s;e of internal light and &s;en&s;ibility of con|&s;cience: and then, according to this new principle, he is undoubtedly, on the whole, more vile, odious and a|bominable in God's &s;ight, than he would have been, had he continued &s;ecure and at ea&s;e, going on in his &s;ins. I appeal to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, is not this &s;trange divinity? What! is there no po&s;&s;ibility that the drunkard, the thief, the liar, the profane &s;wearer, the adulterer, the murderer and bla&s;phemer &s;hould become, on the whole, le&s;s vicious in God's &s;ight while unregene|rate,
<PB N="19" REF="010691_0029_0F81E2DD9FB72BD0">
by reforming all this atrocious wickedne&s;s, tho' on no higher principle than that of natural con&s;cience, awakened by the common influences of the &s;pirit, as Ahab was, to a &s;en&s;e of the maje&s;ty and perfections of God, the ill de&s;ert of &s;in, and fears of divine wrath, than he would be, continuing in the practice of all this wickedne&s;s?&mdash;Strange ab&s;urdity this!</P>
<P>But what is &s;till more &s;trange, the unregenerate &s;in|ner, on this principle while &s;uch, that lives in the prac|tice of all this wickedne&s;s, as above de&s;cribed, can't be reformed, even by the common illuminations of the holy &s;pirit, but by being, on the whole, more vile, in God's &s;ight, than he would be in the continued practice of it! becau&s;e &s;uch reformations &s;uppo&s;e the increa&s;e of inter|nal light and &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience!</P>
<P>Thus by &s;trictly following this new principle, we are come to an ab&s;olute certainty that how vicious &s;oever the unregenerate may be in the &s;tate of their minds, by a|bandoning them&s;elves to all manner of wickedne&s;s, un|der the go&s;pel; there is no po&s;&s;ible way of their becom|ing on the whole le&s;s &s;o, by any reformation and amend|ment of life whatsoever, while unregenerate; yea, of their reforming in any in&s;tance, without being on the whole, more vile in God's &s;ight.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another ab&s;urdity ari&s;ing from this new principle is, that the more &s;tupid, carele&s;s, and unconcern'd men are under the go&s;pel, about what &s;ins they commit and what duties they neglect; the le&s;s vile, odious and abo|minable they are on the whole, in God's &s;ight. This conclu&s;ion, however glaring the folly of it, is yet firm and cannot be avoided, if the principle advanced be true. For if the more awakened, reformed and attentive on all known duty &s;inners are, under the go&s;pel, the more vile; it mu&s;t needs follow, that the le&s;s awakened, re|formed
<PB N="20" REF="010691_0030_0F81E2DE5C45F5F8">
and attentive on duty under the &s;ame go&s;pel, the le&s;s vile, odious, and abominable mu&s;t they be, on the whole, in God's &s;ight.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this matter and make it plain to the weake&s;t capacity, let it be ob&s;erved that the degrees of internal light and &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience found in men under the go&s;pel are various; whence ari&s;eth a propor|tional concern to avoid &s;in and attend on duty, in order to avoid mi&s;ery and obtain happine&s;s. And &s;uppo&s;e this difference of &s;en&s;ibility of conscience in men, relating to the&s;e things, be divided into ten equal parts or degrees, as it may be con&s;i&s;tent with truth; the fir&s;t having very little &s;en&s;e of the maje&s;ty of God and of the ill de&s;ert of &s;in, his <HI>moral &s;en&s;e</HI> being almo&s;t quite lo&s;t; &s;o that the commi&s;&s;ion of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t crimes is well nigh a matter of indifferency with him; the &s;econd has one degree more of &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience, and &s;ome care to avoid &s;ins of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t kind; a third ri&s;eth to a &s;till further de|gree of &s;en&s;ibility; and &s;o on to the tenth; all equal in other re&s;pects, brought up under the &s;ame go&s;pel, and well indoctrinated. [Here let it be noted, that what is &s;aid is not meerly a &s;uppo&s;ition, but what agrees with fact; and is really the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e.] And now upon this new principle, the fir&s;t who is really mo&s;t hardened in con&s;cience, and mo&s;t vicious in his practice is lea&s;t vile and odious in the &s;ight of God; the &s;econd is more &s;o; and &s;o on to the tenth, who is, in God's &s;ight the vile&s;t of all the gang, being in a great degree con|vinced of the evil of &s;in, and of the dreadfulne&s;s of that wrath to which he &s;tands ju&s;tly expo&s;ed, trembles at the thought of his pa&s;t &s;ins, and in fear left he &s;hould of|fend in thought, word, or deed, feels him&s;elf a lo&s;t peri&s;hing creature; and that &s;overeign mercy only can be his remedy. Thus the poor trembling, convinced,
<PB N="21" REF="010691_0031_0F81E2DF1948C740">
reformed &s;inner (I mean as much as an unregenerate &s;in|ner can be &s;o) is now, according to this new principle, the mo&s;t odious in God's &s;ight of the ten; and more &s;o, than when being &s;tupid, under the &s;ame external means of light, he wallowed in all manner of mo&s;t abominable wickedne&s;s. And it mu&s;t needs be &s;o, according to this new principle, becau&s;e he now &s;ins again&s;t greater inter|nal light, as in the author's own words, quoted above. <Q>Yea, his impenitence and all his &s;ins are &s;o aggravated by the light and convictions he obtains, that whatever particular ways of known &s;in he has for&s;aken, and how many &s;oever external duties he attends; yet, on the whole, he is undoubtedly a greater &s;inner than when he lived in &s;ecurity.</Q> P. 125.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, according to this new principle, that the only po&s;&s;ible way, that &s;inners indulging them&s;elves in all manner of vicious and immoral practices, can, even under the go&s;pel, become on the whole, le&s;s vicious in the &s;tate of their mind, while unregenerate, is by becom|ing more &s;tupid and regardle&s;s what &s;ins they commit. It being impo&s;&s;ible a becoming le&s;s vicious &s;hould be ac|compli&s;hed by any conviction or amendment of life; &s;ince by every &s;tep of advance this way, the &s;inner is &s;aid to be, on the whole, more vile and odious in God's &s;ight. Nor can he be le&s;s &s;o by &s;tanding &s;till; continuing in the &s;ame &s;tate he is in, it is certain can never render him le&s;s vici|ous; &s;o that the only po&s;&s;ible way of his becoming on the whole le&s;s vicious, con&s;i&s;tent with this principle, is by a thoughtle&s;s giving him&s;elf up to the commi&s;&s;ion of all manner of wickedne&s;s, without care or thought. Strange divinity &s;till! Nor is it in my power to doubt, that the grand enemy of Chri&s;t's cau&s;e and precious &s;ouls, puts his hearty Amen to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another ab&s;urdity that ari&s;es from this principle, is,
<PB N="22" REF="010691_0032_0F81E2E099F66490">
that in an exact proportion, as any one under the go&s;pel is, in the language of the author, more likely to be &s;a|ved, and, in the phra&s;e of our &s;aviour, "nearer to the kingdom of God," he is on the whole more vile and o|dious in God's &s;ight. The author has &s;pent many pages in confirming this point [P. 128 to 132] viz. <Q>that the more diligent in attending means, and the more in|&s;truction men get, the more likely it is they will be &s;aved;</Q> and near as many in a&s;&s;erting <Q>&s;uch are un|doubtedly, on the whole, more vile and odious in the &s;ight of God;</Q> &s;o that it mu&s;t be a maxim with tho&s;e of this principle, that the more likely any one, under the go&s;pel, is to be &s;aved, the more vile, odious and abominable he is, on the whole, in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this matter, &s;uppo&s;e A. and B. for in|&s;tance, brought up under the &s;ame light and advantages of the go&s;pel, A. by early abandoning him&s;elf to all manner of mo&s;t abominable wickedne&s;s, hath well nigh utterly &s;inned away his con&s;cience, &s;o that it is a matter of indifferency with him now, to bla&s;pheme God, or in|nocently je&s;t with a neighbour. B. from early childhood, has con&s;tantly paid &s;uch reverence and obedience to the dictates of con&s;cience, as hath nouri&s;hed the greate&s;t de|gree of tenderne&s;s, to regard all duty and avoid all &s;in, that can agree to an unregenerate &s;tate. It is here al|lowed that B. is more likely to be &s;aved than A. but then it is equally maintained, that in the &s;ame proportion that B. is more likely to be &s;aved, he is on the whole more wicked, a murderous, bla&s;phemous <HI>A.</HI> A, can on this prin|ciple, &s;carcely be denominated a &s;inner at all; to be &s;ure he is nothing of a &s;inner compared with B. who has all his life time been trained up to that tenderne&s;s of con&s;ci|ence, in a great mea&s;ure, to avoid known &s;in and prac|ti&s;e known duty, that renders him on the whole in God's
<PB N="23" REF="010691_0033_0F81E2E15C342F30">
&s;ight, the mo&s;t vile, odious and abominable &s;inner on the face of the whole earth.</P>
<P>The like con&s;equence is unavoidable, for any thing I can &s;ee, if this principle be carried into the Heathen world. He that makes the greate&s;t improvements on the light of nature, in di&s;covering the being and attri|butes of God, the immortality of the &s;oul, the ill de&s;ert of &s;in, &amp;c. and comes up neare&s;t to the dictates of con|&s;cience, in the moral life (&s;uppo&s;e an Epictetus) he is the vile&s;t of all the heathen world; becau&s;e in failing to come up to his duty, he &s;ins again&s;t the greate&s;t light.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to ob&s;erve here that the&s;e things never did agree to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind; or of the Chri&s;|tian world; and to my weak under&s;tanding, I mu&s;t &s;ay they &s;ound too &s;trange to be true. However, to avoid all partiality, I appeal to the attentive impartial reader,</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether the&s;e be not ab&s;urdities by no means to be admitted in divinity? And,</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether it is po&s;&s;ible to avoid them, the principle advanced, being admitted?</P>
<P>I might here go on to multiply the like ob&s;ervations, but that in my humble opinion the&s;e hints are &s;ufficient to exclude a doctrine that never yet was admitted into the chri&s;tian creed, and mu&s;t (if ever it be) come in with a train of bad company.</P>
<P>ii. The point in hand may be argued from &s;undry texts of &s;cripture; of which two only &s;hall be mentioned here.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The men of Nineveh &s;hall ri&s;e in judgment with this gene|ration, and &s;hall condemn it; becau&s;e they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold a greater than Jonas is here</HI>; Matt. 12. 41. i. e. the repentance of the Ninevites, under the preaching of Jonas, &s;hall condemn, in the day of judgment, the want of that repentance in the Jews, un|der the preaching of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="010691_0034_0F81E2E26B665618">Now if the Ninevites repentance, as it is on good grounds generally conceded, (as hath been hinted before) was but repentance on principles of nature; natural con|&s;cience being awakened to a &s;en&s;e of the dreadful ma|je&s;ty of God &s;inned again&s;t, and &s;o of the dreadful de&s;ert of &s;in, convinced of the imminent danger they were in of impending ruin threatened, moved only by fear, they humbled them&s;elves before God, broke off their &s;ins and "turned from their evil way," as God witne&s;&s;eth they did, <HI>Jon.</HI> 2, 10. If, I &s;ay, all this was upon na|tural principles, being unregenerate as to the body of that va&s;t people, as was undoubtedly the ca&s;e,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not only from what hath been already &s;aid on this head, but becau&s;e, on a contrary &s;uppo&s;ition, the work of God mu&s;t have been far more glorious there; than on the out-pouring of the &s;pirit on the day of Penteco&s;t. And not only &s;o, but it mu&s;t, it &s;eems, have been altogether miraculous, as they were in the depth of heatheni&s;h dark|ne&s;s, and for any thing we know, had not &s;o much as the name of a Mediator, to be believed on among them; and &s;o had no foundation for that repentance which accompanies or flows from faith. Nor is it conceivable but that, had it been of a gracious nature, it had been named in all afer generations as &s;uch.</NOTE> it mu&s;t I think from this in&s;tance appear exceeding clear, that the awakened reformed &s;inner is not, on the whole, un|doubtedly more vile in God's &s;ight, than the harden'd and &s;ecure, going on in his fins; for if &s;o, how could the repentance of the Ninevites, which was but an awa|kened reformed &s;tate, condemn in the day of judgment the want of that repentance in the hardened Jews, ob&s;ti|nately per&s;i&s;ting in their &s;ins, under at lea&s;t equal advan|tages by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another text from which the truth before us may be argued, is Chri&s;t's declaration to the &s;cribe, <HI>Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</HI> Which is evidently &s;aid with a view to his reply to Chri&s;t's an&s;wer to that que&s;|tion, <HI>What is the first commandment of all?</HI> v. 28. Chri&s;t's
<PB N="25" REF="010691_0035_0F81E2E2DA98A7A0">
an&s;wer follows; to which the &s;cribe replies, <HI>Well, ma&s;ter, thou ha&s;t &s;aid the truths,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And when Je&s;us &s;aw that he an&s;wered di&s;creetly,</HI> i. e. di&s;cover'd &s;oundne&s;s in doctrine, a freedom from that gro&s;s ignorance, prejudice, and bit|terne&s;s again&s;t the doctrine and per&s;on of Chri&s;t, that many others di&s;covered. In the view of the&s;e things, by which he was, in the &s;tate of his mind, le&s;s vicious, Chri&s;t pronounceth him not far from the kingdom of God, i. e. not at &s;o great a remove from the &s;tate of a good man.</P>
<P>In order to our further confirmation that this, for &s;ub|&s;tance, is the true meaning of the&s;e words, the following particulars may be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. That by the kingdom of God here is meant a &s;tate of grace; the &s;tate of a good man, in who&s;e heart the invi&s;ible kingdom of grace is &s;et up; that kingdom we are exhorted to &s;eek fir&s;t, <HI>Matt.</HI> 6, 33; and which is &s;aid to be taken by violence, <HI>Matt.</HI> 11, 12.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The phra&s;e here made u&s;e of (<HI>not far from the kingdom of God</HI>) is not to be under&s;tood as relating to the time of the &s;cribe's conver&s;ion, or being brought into a &s;tate of grace; &s;ince &s;o under&s;tood, it is of the nature of a prophecy, that reveals the certainty of his conver&s;ion, and that the time was now nigh: in which &s;en&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e none under&s;tand it: it mu&s;t therefore be under&s;tood to be a nighne&s;s in &s;tate to that of a good man. As Epa|phroditus is &s;aid to be &s;ick, nigh unto death (<HI>Phi.</HI> 2, 27) not to the time of his dying; for he did not die by that &s;ickne&s;s; but was brought low, and in &s;tate <HI>nigh</HI> unto death: &s;o there were many de&s;irable things found in the &s;cribe, not that were holy or &s;piritual; yet such as ren|dered him le&s;s &s;inful than tho&s;e who were de&s;titute of his attainments; and le&s;s &s;o than him&s;elf would have been in their ab&s;ence; and &s;uch as are ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary, in
<PB N="26" REF="010691_0036_0F81E2E39820B648">
order to being brought into a &s;tate of grace; in the view of which, as being le&s;s &s;inful in the &s;tate of his mind, he is here pronounced not far from the kingdom of God, i. e. as explained, in &s;tate, not &s;o far from that of a good man, comparatively &s;peaking, as tho&s;e who remained under the power of that ignorance, prejudice and &s;tupi|dity, from which he was in a mea&s;ure freed.</P>
<P>But what tho&s;e things are, by which he was le&s;s &s;inful in the &s;tate of his mind, and nearer to that of a good man, may be clearly &s;een in the &s;cribes reply &mdash; <HI>Well, ma&s;ter, thou ha&s;t &s;aid the truth: for there is one God, and there is none other but he; and to love him with all the heart, and with all the under&s;tanding, and with all the &s;oul, and with all the &s;trength, and to love his neighbour as him&s;elf, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices. And when Je&s;us &s;aw that he an&s;wered di&s;creetly,</HI> i. e. di&s;covered a good under&s;tanding of that in which the &s;ub&s;tance of all religion greatly con&s;i&s;ts, di&s;tingui&s;hed well between meer po&s;itives, and duties of a moral nature, and that he was in a great degree free from that ignorance, &s;tupidity, rancour, malice and prejudice again&s;t the doctrine and per&s;on of Chri&s;t, that &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds, and with &s;o much rage was acted out by others; in com|pari&s;on with whom he is here no doubt pronounced not far from the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>From the words thus explained it appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is &s;uch a thing among the unregenerate under the go&s;pel, as being in &s;tate nigh to and far from the kingdom of God; witne&s;s what is here pronounced of the &s;cribe, as explained above.</P>
<P N="2">2. That their nearne&s;s in &s;tate to the kingdom of God, or which is the &s;ame, to that of a good man, con&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e attainments whereby they were, on the whole, in the &s;tate of their minds, le&s;s vicious than either them&s;elves
<PB N="27" REF="010691_0037_0F81E2E474F54FE0">
or others would be in the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e things. This hath been clearly &s;een in tho&s;e attainments in the view and on the account of which 'tis evident the &s;cribe is here pronounced not far from the kingdom of God, as explained above. And indeed it could not agree to the purity of God's nature, to pronounce one nigh in &s;tate to that of a good man, in compari&s;on of another, unle&s;s that one was on the whole, in the &s;tate of his mind, le&s;s vicious than the other; becau&s;e it would not be true. This is as evident, as it is that there are degrees of &s;in|fulne&s;s found with the unregenerate under the go&s;pel, and that every le&s;s degree found in any one, brings them in &s;tate one degree nearer to that of a good man. Hence it may be conclu&s;ively argued from the&s;e words (the ex|planation above being allowed) that all awakened refor|med &s;inners under the go&s;pel are not, on the whole, more vile in God's &s;ight, than when &s;ecure and at ea&s;e, going on in their &s;ins under the &s;ame external means of light; in&s;tance the &s;cribe in the text, of whom the con|trary is witne&s;&s;ed by our &s;aviour.</P>
<P>To &s;um up this argument in brief, it &s;tands thus. By this phra&s;e of our &s;aviour <HI>(Thou art not far from the king|dom of God)</HI> is meant either,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he was nigh to the time of his conver&s;ion, or,</P>
<P N="2">2. That he was <HI>meerly</HI> more likely to be converted without re&s;pect had to any of tho&s;e things, by which, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, he was le&s;s &s;inful; or,</P>
<P N="3">3. That he was nigh in &s;tate to that of a good man on the account of tho&s;e attainments by which, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, he was le&s;s &s;inful in the &s;tate of his mind.</P>
<P>One or the other of the&s;e, it &s;eems, mu&s;t be the true &s;en&s;e of this phra&s;e. As to the fir&s;t, none I tru&s;t will fix on that. The &s;econd is untrue, &s;ince 'tis evident, from the expre&s;s letter of the &s;acred text, that in what is &s;aid
<PB N="28" REF="010691_0038_0F81E2E517E8C5F8">
of the &s;cribe's being nigh or not far from the kingdom of God, re&s;pect is had to tho&s;e things and tho&s;e only, by which, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, he was le&s;s &s;inful. And therefore the third mu&s;t be the true and genuine &s;en&s;e of this phra&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, from this &s;ingle in&s;tance, fairly un|der&s;tood, that &s;inners awakened to a diligent attendance on means, brought in a mea&s;ure to a rectified judgment relating to divine truth, to abate in their prejudice again&s;t it and reform known evils, are not always more vile and odious in God's &s;ight, than they would have been had they continued more ignorant, &s;tupid and prejudiced a|gain&s;t the truth, indulging them&s;elves in all manner of wickedne&s;s, under the &s;ame external means of light.</P>
<P>I. I &s;hall re&s;ume the con&s;ideration of what has been touched upon, under a former head, viz. that the grand que&s;tion, on the re&s;olution of which this whole contro|ver&s;y mu&s;t finally turn, is whether the additional &s;in, at|tending continued impenitence under the clear light of the go&s;pel, ari&s;ing meerly from that &s;en&s;ibility of con|&s;cience, whereby the awakened &s;inner reforms all known &s;in, even the mo&s;t enormous wickedne&s;s, &s;uch as for|nication, adultery, &amp;c. is more vile and odious in God's &s;ight, than great &s;tupidity and hardne&s;s of heart, together with the daring practice of all that enormous wickedne&s;s as above, which agrees to and naturally flows from a hardened &s;tate under the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>It hath already been clearly evinced, that this &s;en&s;i|bility of con&s;cience, with the fruits thereof, &s;uch as a &s;en&s;e of the ill de&s;ert of &s;in, fear of puni&s;hment, concern to e&s;cape it, reforming known evils, &amp;c. con&s;idered in them&s;elves, can't render the &s;inner more vile in the &s;ight of God, than their ab&s;ence, becau&s;e at lea&s;t of a negative moral goodne&s;s in them; &s;o that the only point to be

<P><HI>Objection.</HI> If it be objected here, that &s;inners, before awakened, are not wont to practi&s;e the&s;e heinous crimes; and therefore the awakened &s;inner's avoiding or the &s;tu|pid &s;inner's practi&s;ing them, is not to be pleaded. I an|&s;wer, the univer&s;al term u&s;ed by the author, as &s;een above, does, and was doubtle&s;s de&s;igned to comprehend all, with|out exception that might be practis'd by the &s;tupid; and reform'd by the awakened. And that this may be, and &s;ometimes is the ca&s;e, as repre&s;ented above, &s;trictly a|grees to the &s;cripture account, <HI>Neither fornicators, nor ido|laters, nor adulteres, nor effeminate, nor abu&s;ers of them&s;elves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor re|vilers, nor extortioners; and &s;uch were &s;ome of you; but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye an &s;anctified,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now having &s;et this matter in a fair light, I will dare to appeal to the judicious reader, whether it ben't mo&s;t apparent on the very mention of the ca&s;e, &s;et in a true light, that no &s;uch heinou&s;ne&s;s can be found in the &s;in called <HI>additional to</HI> impenitence continued under the clear light of the go&s;pel, ari&s;ing <HI>meerly</HI> from that &s;en&s;ibi|lity,

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. That this point is already determined by our &s;aviour as &s;een above, page 12; where it is clearly &s;hewed that the degree of wickedne&s;s in Chorazin and Beth&s;aida above that of Tyre and Sidon, con&s;i&s;ted in a greater degree of &s;tupidity and hardne&s;s of heart in the former, whereby they were more unimpre&s;&s;able than the latter, the &s;ame external means and advantages to repent being &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>

teacheth, that what is called demon&s;tration in one age, is rejected in another; and what is called &s;o by one man, is of no validity with another; and oft'times with the &s;ame man in different dates of his life; let us, I &s;ay, removing as far as po&s;&s;ible from the&s;e things, im|partially enquire of what account the&s;e different charac|ters of men, are with the ble&s;&s;ed God; and how he treats them, both in his word and providence, viz. that of the awakened &s;inner, brought, tho' on principles of nature, to humble him&s;elf before God, repent, reform known evils, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly attend known duties; and that of the &s;tout-hearted, bold, daring, hardened &s;in|ner, that ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ts in all manner of vicious and immoral practices, under the &s;ame external means of light, and again&s;t the clear dictates of his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>If we can find clearly of what account the&s;e characters are with the omni&s;cient God, compared with each other; and how he treats them, both in his word and providence; we &s;hall find what they really are, con&s;idered in them|&s;elves; and a more &s;ure ground to form our judgment concerning them, than all our weak rea&s;onings can other|wi&s;e furni&s;h us with. I &s;hall therefore touch on a few in&s;tances of each kind, as exhibited in the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Relating to the awakened, humbled, reformed &s;in|ner, I begin with that famous in&s;tance we have in king Ahab, a none-&s;uch for wickedne&s;s; yet when that terri|ble me&s;&s;age was delivered him by the prophet, it is &s;aid, <Q>He rent his cloaths, put &s;ackcloth on his fle&s;h and fa&s;ted,</Q> &amp;c. Of which the Lord takes this favourable notice, and defers the evil threatned; <Q>See&s;t thou how Ahab humbleth him&s;elf before me? Becau&s;e he hum|bleth him&s;elf before me, I will not bring the evil in his days.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">K. xxi. 25,&mdash;29.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="010691_0042_0F81E2E9A07111A8">Now can any one imagine, according to the principle advanced, that Ahab was, on the whole, more vile and odious to God, when he thus humbled him&s;elf before him, and walk'd &s;oftly, i. e. was le&s;s bold and daring in his wickedne&s;s, than if he had been le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of his &s;in, and more regardle&s;s of God's threatnings? How can this be? when God &s;aith, <Q>becau&s;e he humbleth him|&s;elf before me,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>A like in&s;tance we have in Jehu's zeal in executing the commandment of the Lord upon the hou&s;e of Ahab. <Q>And the Lord &s;aid unto Jehu, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and ha&s;t done unto the hou&s;e of Ahab, according to all that was in mine heart; thy children of the fourth generation &s;hall &s;it on the throne of I&s;rael. But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of I&s;rael.</Q></P>
<P>Is it not evident here, from God's expre&s;s approbation, and the bestowment of &s;o great, tho' outward favour, becau&s;e he had done well, that in God's account, his obedience, tho' but the matter of duty, upon principles of nature, was le&s;s wicked than a total di&s;regard to God's command would have been?</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance is that of the children of I&s;rael, when awakened by the terrifying manner of the giving of the law, being uttered by the voice of God, out of the mid&s;t of the fire. <Q>They &s;aid to Mo&s;es, &s;peak thou unto us, all that the Lord our God &s;hall &s;peak unto thee, and we will hear it and do it. And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, I have heard the voice of the words which they have spoken unto thee: they have well &s;aid, all they have &s;poken.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. v. 27, 28.</NOTE></Q> And here again, is it not evident from God's expre&s;s approbation, that in his account they were le&s;s vile, expre&s;&s;ing this &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience,
<PB N="33" REF="010691_0043_0F81E2EA5DDEB698">
and purpo&s;e of obedience on this awful awakening occa&s;ion, than they would have been, had they remained under the power of &s;tupidity, and &s;aid with Pharaoh, <Q>Who is the Lord, that we &s;hould obey his voice?</Q> Again,</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance, not the lea&s;t of all famous, is that of Nineveh, an exceeding great city, in which, 'tis &s;aid, <Q>were more than fix &s;core thou&s;and per&s;ons that knew not their right hand from their left;</Q> and, perhaps, more than 6 times that number in the whole. Upon being warned by the preaching of Jonah, that <Q>in forty days Nineveh &s;hould be de&s;troyed: It is &s;aid, the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fa&s;t; the king's decree went forth, forbiding man or bea&s;t to ta&s;te any thing; but to be covered with &s;ackcloth, cry mightily to God, and turn every one from the evil of his ways, and from the violence that is in their hands. Whereupon, it is &s;aid, God &s;aw their works, that they turned from their evil ways; and God repented of the evil that he &s;aid he would do unto them, and did it not.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jon. iii.</NOTE></P>
<P>I take it for granted here, we have no warrant from rea&s;on or &s;cripture, once to imagine their prayers, humi|liations and reformations were acted upon higher princ|ples than tho&s;e of natural con&s;cience, awakened to a &s;en&s;e of their &s;in and danger, at lea&s;t as to the body of that va&s;t people. For tho' it is here &s;aid, they believed God, and el&s;ewhere, they repented; it is well known that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are frequently u&s;ed in &s;cripture, to &s;ig|nify but &s;emblances of the&s;e graces, as Judas repented, and the devils believed and trembled, and Simon Magus believed.</P>
<P>Since therefore, there is no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to conclude the repentance of the Ninevites proceeded from a prin|ciple of &s;aving grace; and &s;ince &s;o great &s;alvation is be|&s;towed
<PB N="34" REF="010691_0044_0F81E2EB840EFC78">
out of re&s;pect to it: Is it not evident, that in God's account, they were not more vile than if they had continued altogether &s;ecure and unaffected under the warning? Their repentance was made the only condition of their great &s;alvation. And can it agree to the purity of God's nature, to make a greater degree of wickedne&s;s, on the whole, the condition of be&s;towing a great &s;alvation tho' of an outward nature? Sure it cannot, &s;ince this would be to manife&s;t &s;ome regard to &s;in, and encourage men to practice it with boldne&s;s.</P>
<P>Again, that the awakened, reformed &s;inner, is le&s;s vile in God's account, than the &s;tupid and unreformed under the &s;ame external means of light, is clearly held forth in tho&s;e words of our Saviour. <Q>When the un|clean &s;pirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, &s;eeking re&s;t, and findeth none. Then he &s;aith, I will return into my hou&s;e, from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, &s;wept, and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh with him &s;even other &s;pirits more wicked than him|&s;elf, and they enter in and dwell there: and the la&s;t &s;tate of that man is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</Q> By the hou&s;e empty, &s;wept and garni&s;hed, is repre&s;ented the &s;tate of an awakened, reformed &s;inner, when wickedne&s;s as to the actings of it is re&s;trained, the unclean &s;pirit gone out. By his return with &s;even other &s;pirits more wicked than him&s;elf entering in, and dwelling there, is repre|&s;ented the more de&s;perate wicked &s;tate, to which he is reduced on the abatement of his conviction, returning with further degrees of contracted hardne&s;s of heart to the unre&s;trained practice of mere de&s;perate degrees of wickedne&s;s. Now 'tis expre&s;sly affirmed, that the la&s;t &s;tate of that man is WORSE than the fir&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 43&mdash;45.</NOTE> This al&s;o is applied to the jewi&s;h nation, even &s;o &s;hall it be al&s;o with
<PB N="35" REF="010691_0045_0F81E2EBDDBB6788">
this wicked generation: i. e. they who were awakened, brought to con&s;ider, and in a mea&s;ure to amend their lives by the preaching of John Bapti&s;t, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, and by the mighty works done among them, but finally hardened their hearts, and rejected the cleare&s;t light and evidence of the truth; thereby ripened them|&s;elves for a more aggravated condemnation, and brought the wrath of God upon them to the uttermo&s;t, in their final de&s;truction by the Romans. This de&s;truction came upon them for their crying, vi&s;ible &s;ins, extreme hardne&s;s of heart, and open unbelief, and contemptuous rejection of Chri&s;t, and not merely for their unregeneracy under con|tinued convictions and reformations.</P>
<P>By all which, it is evident they were in God's account le&s;s wicked while they retained &s;ome tenderne&s;s of con|&s;cience, and were in a mea&s;ure re&s;trained from the out breakings of wickedne&s;s, repre&s;ented by the unclean &s;pirit going out of them, than when they being given up to the hardne&s;s of their hearts, abandoned them&s;elves to all manner of mo&s;t de&s;perate and unheard of wickedne&s;s, repre&s;ented by the return of the unclean &s;pirit, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance is that of our Saviour's re&s;pect, ex|pre&s;t to the young man, on who&s;e declaration of his hav|ing ob&s;erv'd the commandments from his youth, 'tis &s;aid, "Chri&s;t beholding him, loved him."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark x. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now whatever di&s;putes may be railed on the&s;e words; two things, I &s;uppo&s;e, will be allowed by all,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he was a per&s;on of an externally moral and amiable conver&s;ation; one that had in a great degree e&s;caped the pollution of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. That on that account, Chri&s;t &s;hewed him re&s;pect, at lea&s;t as being le&s;s vile, than if he had under his reli|gious advantages continued in greater degrees of &s;tupidi|ty, and lived in the open violation of all God's command|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="010691_0046_0F81E2ECA4D1A0F0">Again, the &s;ame truth is clearly held forth by the apo&s;tle Peter, where he tells us, <Q>If after they have e&s;caped the pollutions of the world, through the know|ledge of the Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are again entangled therein, and overcome; the latter end is wor&s;e with them than the beginning.</Q> Is it not plainly implied in the&s;e words, that while he is not again intangled, and overcome with the pollutions of the world, i. e. continues to e&s;cape them, he is le&s;s vile? The apo&s;tle concludes this argument, by comparing the &s;tate of an awakened, reformed &s;inner, while he e&s;capes the pollutions of the world, i. e. more enormous and gro&s;s wickedne&s;s, to that of a &s;ow wa&s;hed from her filthi|ne&s;s; and the &s;tate of one returning again to gro&s;s wick|edne&s;s, to that of the &s;ame &s;ow returning to her wallow|ing in the mire. The difference here made by the Holy Gho&s;t, in favour of the former, is very &s;en&s;ible. For tho' the &s;ow wa&s;hed be not changed in her nature; yet in that &s;tate &s;he differs much from her&s;elf wallowing in the mire.</P>
<P>Are not the&s;e as clear indications, as can well be given by words, that the account the ble&s;&s;ed God makes of the&s;e different characters of men, under the means of grace, is in favour of the negative part of the que&s;tion?</P>
<P>On the other hand, if we enquire,</P>
<P N="2">2nd. Of what account with the ble&s;&s;ed God the cha|racter of the &s;ecure, bold, pre&s;umptuous, hardened &s;in|ner is, who ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ts in vicious and immoral practices; what &s;hall we find throughout the &s;criptures, but the wrath of God burning again&s;t &s;uch, either in tremendous threats, or executions of his judgments?</P>
<P>i. The threats are expre&s;t in the&s;e terms or the like; <Q>He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pro. xxix. I.</NOTE>

<P>Thus I might go on to multiply the threats of God's word, particularly pointed again&s;t per&s;ons of this cha|racter, that go on in an unconcerned indulgence of im|moral practices.</P>
<P>Should it be objected here, that eternal damnation is every where threatened the impenitent, and unbelieving, how much &s;o ever reformed, which contains in it infi|nitely more than all the outward judgments threatened above. I an&s;wer: This is nothing to the pre&s;ent argu|ment; becau&s;e this condemnation falls at lea&s;t equally, on the profligate, &s;ince he is equally guilty of impeni|tence and unbelief, as it does on the reformed; and &s;o hath nothing in it, quite nothing to ballance the peculiar marks of God's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the &s;ecure, vicious and immoral, contained in tho&s;e threats above; and therefore the argument from them &s;tands good, that in God's account, the awakened and reformed are le&s;s, to be &s;ure not more, vile and odious, than tho&s;e of a con|trary

<P>ii. That which further confirms the pre&s;ent argument, is the grounds every where a&s;&s;igned, of the execution of God's wrath, in the way of his providence, corre&s;pondent with the threatenings of his word; which if enquired into, will be found, not meerly to be the <HI>wickedne&s;s of con|tinued impenitence, under great degrees of conviction and ten|derne&s;s of con&s;cience exciting to great concern to avoid all known &s;in, and practi&s;e all known duty:</HI> but intirely the rever&s;e, <HI>great &s;tupidity, with the effects thence naturally ari&s;ing; &s;uch as a bold, daring commi&s;&s;ion of all abominable wickedne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;What was it that brought God's wrath upon the old world, when a deluge of water &s;wept off it's inhabitants?

<P>What was it that: brought &s;howers of fire upon Sodom, but the unutterable height of their &s;tupidity and out|rageous wickedne&s;s, burning in their unnatural lu&s;ts one towards another?</P>
<P>How were God's judgments executed upon Pharaoh? Was it meerly for the want of gracious &s;incerity, in ac|knowledging the true God, and con&s;enting to let I&s;rael go; or the total want of all &s;en&s;ibility of natural con|&s;cience re&s;i&s;ting the evidence of a &s;even-fold demon&s;tra|tion, that the demands made upon him, were the de|mands of the living and true God, and &s;aying, <Q>Who is the Lord, that I &s;hould obey his voice?

Quite the re|ver&s;e: They openly for&s;ook God, his ordinances and wor&s;hip, and gave them&s;elves up to gross idolatry, wor|&s;hipped the ho&s;t of heaven, and cau&s;ed their &s;ons and daughters to pa&s;s through the fire, u&s;ed divination and inchantments, and &s;old them&s;elves to do evil in the &s;ight of the Lord.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. xvii. 16,-18.

<P>Having thus briefly hinted a few things, which in my humble opinion, are more than barely &s;ufficient to point out how the ble&s;&s;ed God looks upon, and treats the&s;e different characters of men under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I now appeal to the impartial and judicious reader,</P>
<P>i. Whether it be not evident beyond he&s;itation, that the awakened, reformed &s;inner, as above de&s;cribed, is le&s;s, to be &s;ure, not more vile and odious in God's &s;ight, than the &s;tupid and unreformed, under the &s;ame external means of light? And if &s;o,</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="010691_0050_0F81E2F152226138">ii. Whether it be not equally evident, that he is on the whole, really &s;o; &s;ince the great God, from his in|finite perfections, can't but look things through, and make account of them, as being what, on the whole, they really are?</P>
<P>The concurring voice of God, in his word and provi|dence, in the old and new te&s;tament, relating to his co|venant people in all ages, the gentile world, and in &s;o great a variety, as to particular per&s;ons, thus clearly in favour of the negative, is in my humble opinion, of great|er weight, than all uncertain conclu&s;ions to the contrary, from human rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>Should it be objected here, that the premi&s;es advanced being allowed, yet the conclu&s;ion aimed at, does not follow.</P>
<P>All I &s;hall reply, as a conclu&s;ion under this general head, is a &s;olemn appeal to all that are &s;erious, learned and unlearned, whether there is not evidently a natural tendency in the concurring voice of God, as above, to per&s;uade men into a favourable opinion of the negative? And if &s;o, Whether it be po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e than true, &s;ince nothing is more impo&s;&s;ible, than that the e&s;&s;ential rectitude and purity of God's nature &s;hould do that, which hath a natural tendency to lead his crea|tures into errors and deception. I proceed,</P>
<P>V. As was propo&s;ed, to touch briefly on &s;ome parti|cular pa&s;&s;ages, which to me appear liable to exception, as not being clear from the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject propo&s;ed by the author, to be treated un|der this &s;ection, is expre&s;&s;ed in the following words, viz: <Q>Of the end and de&s;ign of means, and the true ground of encouragement for men to be in the diligent u&s;e of them, in order to their &s;alvation.</Q> Three que&s;tions are here con&s;idered. <Q>Que&s;. I. What are the means
<PB N="41" REF="010691_0051_0F81E2F1DEE36110">
of grace and &s;alvation, and what is meant by u&s;ing the&s;e means?</Q></P>
<P>After many things &s;aid under this head, the author proceeds to point out &s;everal things, which he &s;aith, <Q>are in a more remote &s;en&s;e the means of grace and &s;alvation.</Q> Among which it is &s;aid, <Q>Such in a pe|culiar manner is divine revelation; and all tho&s;e in|&s;titutions and appointments therein to be attended on by men; &s;uch as reading the bible, publick and pri|vate in&s;tructions, religious conver&s;ation, &s;erious medi|tations on divine things, &amp;c. and particularly PRAY|ER, which is the mo&s;t &s;olemn way of meditating on divine truths.</Q> It &s;eems here, after all that is &s;aid by the author, we are left intirely to our own gue&s;s, to deter|mine whether it be the duty of the unregenerate, as a means among others, to pray for regenerating grace.</P>
<P>The author indeed once mentions prayer in capitals, as an in&s;titution contained in the word of God, to be at|tended on by men. But then what is &s;aid in confirmation of it, is, that <Q>it is the mo&s;t &s;olemn way of <HI>medi|tating</HI> on divine truth, &amp;c.</Q> So that it &s;eems rather mentioned under the notion of a &s;olemn way of medita|tion, than as prayer. Nor is this duty enforced by the author on the unregenerate, as attendance on the means of in&s;truction is. Where he thus argues <Q>God's u&s;ing means with men for their in&s;truction, &s;uppos&s;es the propriety and importance of attending on the&s;e means.</Q> But the duty of prayer can't be enforced on the unrege|rate in this way, unle&s;s it be fir&s;t made evident from the word of God, that prayer is the duty of the unregene|rate; which the author carefully avoids &s;o much as to attempt, thro' this whole di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that one of the grand points that hath of late been &s;o much debated, and about which
<PB N="42" REF="010691_0052_0F81E2F299CF96F8">
much enquiry has been made, viz. Whether prayer be the duty of the unregenerate, as a means, among others, to be attended on, in order to obtain regenerating grace, is left loo&s;e and undeterminate in this di&s;cour&s;e; and &s;o in favour of tho&s;e that deny it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Which by the way is a plain rea&s;on why tho&s;e, &s;aid to have imbibed &s;ome new principles in divinity, &s;o generally expre&s;s their &s;atisfaction with what is here written.</NOTE></P>
<P>Should it be &s;uppo&s;ed here, (as &s;ome may plead) that the authors de&s;ign was to fix the duty of prayer upon the unregenerate, as above; and that it is fairly &s;o to be under&s;tood, tho' his expre&s;&s;ions are not &s;o full as might be.</P>
<P>I a&s;k leave to enquire, how this can be &s;uppo&s;ed, con|&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch things as the&s;e following:</P>
<P N="1">1. His not &s;o much as once expre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;erting it, on &s;o &s;pecial an occa&s;ion, when many had denied it to be the duty of the unregenerate, to pray for regenerating grace: Others doubted, whether it was &s;afe to direct &s;ouls, in di&s;tre&s;s, to this duty; many were tempted wholly to neglect it; &s;ome owned the duty, but then in&s;i&s;ted it mu&s;t be performed in faith: A thing as impo&s;&s;ible, in nature, as for the &s;ame thing to be, and not to be at the &s;ame time; not only becau&s;e faith implies regeneration, but al&s;o becau&s;e there is no promi&s;e for the unregenerate to ground their faith upon, as the author has abundantly proved.</P>
<P>Others confine the unregenerate's &s;eeking for grace, to what they call the <HI>go&s;pel way,</HI> meaning the &s;ame thing as above, as is evident, when they explain them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The well known arguments, here urged by tho&s;e who denied the duty of prayer, as above, are &s;uch as the&s;e. Bring no more vain oblations. Does God require a &s;ham? Does he require hypocri&s;y and &s;in?&mdash;Of the&s;e things, and &s;o of all this confu&s;ion, we have good a&s;&s;urance, the
<PB N="43" REF="010691_0053_0F81E2F3653C3230">
author was well acquainted, when he wrote; not only becau&s;e they were in the mo&s;t open and publick manner, from time to time, debated and acted upon; but from the author's own words &s;peaking of the que&s;tion to be con&s;idered in this &s;ection, he ob&s;erves, <Q>It is an impor|tant one, and one about which there is perhaps more enquiry and di&s;pute now, than ever there has been be|fore.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Preface p. 8.</NOTE></Q> Accordingly he makes this one ground of his treat|ing on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>If therefore the author had de&s;ign'd to confirm the duty of prayer on the unregenerate, as above, he had undoubtedly expre&s;&s;ly and plumply &s;poke it out here. <HI>nor,</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Does admitting this &s;uppo&s;ition well agree with the author's not adducing any &s;ingle text or &s;cripture argument, to prove the point; when the &s;criptures a|bound perhaps as much with commands to the unrege|nerate to pray, as to refrain from any immorality, or practi&s;e any moral duty? Is not the whole of every mo|ral duty required of every man? And can it once be imagined, when the whole and every part, as well the matter as manner of duty is required, that a di&s;ability or failure in one point thro' moral impotency di&s;charges our obligation to the other? Sure it cannot. Was it ever doubted, whether unregenerate men are obliged, by God's law, to refrain from external acts of murder and adultery, and to practi&s;e external ju&s;tice and charity, tho' de&s;titute of a gracious principle? And are not the&s;e as much required to be done in a gracious manner as prayer? And is not prayer in general, as much a moral duty of the fir&s;t table, as ju&s;tice and charity of the &s;e|cond? Should it be &s;aid here, that the go&s;pel direction, how to pray aright through the mediator, is po&s;&s;itive? And is not direction how to perform all other duties aright equally &s;o? Again, does the go&s;pel direction, how to
<PB N="44" REF="010691_0054_0F81E2F4809BBF18">
perform moral duties aright, thereby make any one of the&s;e duties void? If therefore the author had de&s;igned to confirm this point; he had doubtle&s;s offered &s;ome con&s;iderations, holding forth from the word of God, that it is the duty of the unregenerate, to pray for regenerat|ing grace. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. That which puts this matter beyond all doubt, is, that the author, not only does not on this mo&s;t &s;pecial occa&s;ion, &s;o much as expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ert, 'tis the duty of the unregenerate to pray, much le&s;s urge it, from the &s;crip|tures; but with much labour endeavours to give the&s;e texts thought to favour it, and more generally u&s;ed to that purpo&s;e by calvini&s;t divines, &s;o far as I am acquaint|ed, &s;uch an interpretation, as is incon&s;i&s;tent with their having any re&s;pect to the unregenerate. At the &s;ame time, he de&s;ires it may be ob&s;erv'd, that <Q>the que&s;tion now in debate, betwixt him and Dr. Mayhew, does not turn upon the interpretation of this text; for let it (&s;ays he) be under&s;tood in either of the &s;en&s;es above mentioned, it makes nothing for the Doctor's pre|mi&s;es, &amp;c.</Q> So that the author may &s;afely be oppo&s;ed here, without any the lea&s;t imputation of joining with the Doctor in this debate again&s;t him, who&s;e &s;en&s;e of the text he has in a manner adopted, which I &s;hall now con&s;ider.</P>
<P><Q>Some, &s;ays he, &s;uppo&s;e that by the <HI>&s;trait gate,</HI> is meant the entrance upon an holy life; which is the &s;ame that is commonly called conver&s;ion, or the new|birth. And by <HI>&s;triving</HI> to enter in at this gate, they under&s;tand the exerci&s;es and endeavours of the unre|generate, which are antecedent to their conver&s;ion. But few or none, who under&s;tand the text thus, &s;up|po&s;e there is any certain connexion between the <HI>&s;triv|ing</HI> here exhorted to, and &s;aving conver&s;ion, or that there is any promi&s;e made to this &s;triving.</Q> This is
<PB N="45" REF="010691_0055_0F81E2F7CAA8CA50">
the &s;en&s;e in which calvini&s;tic divines under&s;tand the text. And it &s;eems &s;omewhat &s;trange, that when this author undertook the cau&s;e of orthodoxy, he &s;hould give up and reject their &s;en&s;e of the text, which was &s;o greatly in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>It is well known tho&s;e on the arminian &s;ide, who main|tain, that regeneration is at or by bapti&s;m, renounce the foregoing &s;en&s;e of this text, as incon&s;i&s;tent with their principles. The&s;e will no doubt join with the author in &s;upporting that &s;en&s;e, which he has attempted to e&s;ta|bli&s;h, viz. <Q>By the <HI>&s;trait gate</HI> our Saviour means in ge|neral the entrance into heaven or eternal life. And then by &s;triving to enter in at this gate, is meant a keeping the commandments of God, or the holy ex|erci&s;es by which they walk in the way to heaven; fight the good fight of faith, and &s;o lay hold on eter|nal life,</Q> which &s;ome think is a &s;hort &s;ummary of their whole &s;cheme. For this tends to deliver them from the invincible influences of the holy Spirit in grown per&s;ons, and &s;en&s;ible experiences and exerci&s;es of mind in conver|&s;ion, &s;ince the <HI>&s;trait gate,</HI> according to this expo&s;ition, has no reference to regeneration. All that adult per&s;ons have to do, is to keep the commands, and &s;o lay hold on eter|nal life.</P>
<P>Is not advancing this glo&s;s on the text, the mo&s;t ef|fectual method that could be taken, unob&s;ervedly to over|throw calvini&s;m in this point, and promote arminiani&s;m, when done, tho' not on de&s;ign, by a profe&s;s'd calvini&s;t in defence of calvini&s;m?</P>
<P>However, as this interpretation of the text made by arminians, was to me ob&s;cure and unintelligible, as not holding forth the true &s;en&s;e of the text; &s;o it is equally &s;o now, when made by a calvini&s;t. But whether this is owing to the mi&s;interpretation of the text, or to my age
<PB N="46" REF="010691_0056_0F81E2F7D8734AE8">
and dulne&s;s, I &s;hall not determine, but leave to the im|partial public, when the following things are con&s;idered.</P>
<P>He explains the <HI>&s;trait gate,</HI> as meaning the entrance into heaven or eternal life. Now if <HI>the entrance into heaven</HI> be a metaphorical expre&s;&s;ion, it is as ob&s;cure as the <HI>&s;trait gate;</HI> and then how can it be a proper explanation of that metaphorical phra&s;e?&mdash;But if he means <HI>entering into heaven</HI> &s;trictly without metaphor, this is not till death, and then it &s;hould &s;eem, that &s;triving to enter in by <HI>this gate</HI> would be endeavouring to die, which makes a very un|couth &s;en&s;e. But take <HI>&s;triving</HI> as he has explained it, <Q>the holy exerci&s;es of true &s;aints, by which they walk in the way to heaven;</Q> yet it is &s;till unintelligible, how they can walk in the <HI>narrow way</HI> that leads to hea|ven, &s;ince they are &s;uppo&s;ed, by his expo&s;ition, to have entered there by pa&s;&s;ing thro' the gate. Surely there is &s;ome impropriety in repre&s;enting per&s;ons travelling to|wards a place, who have already arrived and entered into it.</P>
<P>But if by the <HI>entrance into heaven</HI> or eternal life, he means <HI>the entering into &s;tate of grace</HI> or conver&s;ion, where is the difference which he &s;uppo&s;es between this and the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, which he mentions, and endeavours to overthrow? The &s;triving is before the entrance, or regeneration. How then can it mean the exerci&s;es of true &s;aints?</P>
<P>He has not attempted here to explain what is meant by the <HI>narrow way,</HI> nor &s;hewed the propriety of our Lord's placing <HI>this gate</HI> before <HI>the way</HI> in his repre&s;entati|on; both which are, I apprehend, nece&s;&s;ary to be done, in order to &s;et the &s;en&s;e of this important text in a true and con&s;i&s;tent light. The&s;e are plain and ea&s;y to be un|der&s;tood on the calvini&s;tic interpretation, but very ob&s;cure and unintelligible, for any thing that I have &s;een advanc|ed by tho&s;e on the arminian &s;ide, or this author.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="010691_0057_0F81E2F89AE066D0">Doctor Doddridge, to whom he refers us, paraphra&s;es it as follows, <Q>And let me urge it upon you, that you <HI>exert your utmo&s;t &s;trength to enter at the &s;trait gate,</HI> which I formerly mentioned as leading to eternal life, (Matt. vii, 14. vol. i. 279.) which is, There are many who enter into de&s;truction&mdash;becau&s;e they are di&s;couraged by the hard&s;hips which attend THE ENTRANCE ON A RELIGIOUS LIFE, as they &s;ee, that <HI>&s;trait is the gate, and rugged</HI> and painful the way which leads to eternal life.</Q> And he points it out, as a thing worthy of ob&s;ervation, in his note, that our Lord mentions <HI>the gate</HI> before <HI>the way.</HI> Such is my weakne&s;s, that I cannot devi&s;e why this au|thor referred to Dr. Doddridge, as an authority for his new &s;en&s;e of this text, &s;ince the Doctor does &s;o expre&s;sly repre&s;ent the &s;trait gate, to be the entrance on a religious life. Strive to enter, is the duty enjoined. How came the unregenerate to be excu&s;ed from it? Have they no need to enter? Or have they no need to &s;trive in order to this? Nor do I &s;ee that Mr. Pool's Synop&s;is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poli. Syn. in Loco. Enitimini omnibus viribus. Aperte oftendit Chri&s;tus numerum servandorum non e&s;&s;e definitum decreto excludente omnem actum humanz valuntatis, quando omnes ad cape&s;&s;ende vtam invit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</NOTE> refer'd to, is more to his purpo&s;e, &s;ince he a&s;&s;erts that "Chri&s;t invites or requires all, the unregenerate not excepted, to take in hand or enter upon the way, i. e. of holine&s;s. And that they &s;trive in this matter with all their powers.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Pool was of opinion, that the gate and the way meant the &s;ame thing, a keeping of God's commandments, as the author expre&s;&s;eth it. As we are to call no man father upon earth, I would enquire here, &s;ince the gate and the way, are distinct things in nature, and in the proper u&s;e of the words, have always been &s;o under&s;tood; and &s;ince in their borrowed u&s;e, as applied by Chri&s;t to &s;pirituals, there are two di&s;tinct things which
<PB N="48" REF="010691_0058_0F81E2F95A1D3610">
they aptly point out, viz. enterance upon, and progre&s;s in the chri&s;tian life, what rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for this fancied change of their &s;ignification, that they &s;hould &s;ignify one and the &s;ame thing in a borrowed &s;en&s;e? Is there any way of coming at the true meaning of words, u&s;ed in a borrowed &s;en&s;e, but by having recour&s;e to their &s;ignification, in their natural u&s;e? If therefore, that be changed in their borrowed u&s;e, and no reference had to it; by what rule can their true meaning be a&s;certain|ed? Sure it mu&s;t be left to the capricious humor of every one.</P>
<P>Moreover, that the author's con&s;truction is meerly imaginary, and without foundation, may be further ar|gued thus: It is allowed by all, that by entering the &s;trait gate is meant that, without which there is no en|tering into the kingdom of heaven. But thou&s;ands may have entered into the kingdom of heaven, without en|tering the &s;trait gate, in the author's &s;en&s;e, by living in a cour&s;e of holy obedience, for want of opportunity. It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome have &s;avingly im|braced God through Chri&s;t, in their la&s;t expiring mo|ments, and to have had no opportunity for a cour&s;e of holy obedience. Now if men may enter the &s;trait gate, in the true &s;en&s;e of the words, &s;o as to go to heaven, with|out entering, in the author's &s;en&s;e, then it &s;eems the au|thor's &s;en&s;e is not the true &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus re&s;toring the true and genuine &s;en&s;e of the text, (which might be more abundantly done at large, if there were occa&s;ion) the exhortation &s;tands full to the unrege|nerate, &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate.</P>
<P>Were I allowed to &s;peak freely my humble &s;en&s;e of the text, to me it appears, that by entering the &s;trait gate, is meant active conver&s;ion to God, or a compliance with the covenant of grace, in the way of faith &amp;c. A gate
<PB N="49" REF="010691_0059_0F81E2FA4422B740">
&s;o &s;trait as can never be entered by us, unle&s;s made morally po&s;&s;ible, by the power of God in regenerating grace; and yet the inde&s;pensable duty of all under the go&s;pel. This is the gate we mu&s;t enter upon pain of eternal damnation. What! And not required to &s;trive in this matter! Thrice amazing!</P>
<P>This error hath, I think, hitherto been called Sande|manean, perhaps becau&s;e others have not as yet publicly avow'd it; doubtle&s;s if they do, they will have a ju&s;t right to &s;hare in the honour of if.</P>
<P>However, the author goes on in &s;upport of his inter|pretation, and affirms roundly, <Q>as an evidence that <HI>&s;triving</HI> in the text does not mean the unholy exerci&s;es and endeavours of tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are wholly under the dominion of &s;in; but the holy exerci&s;es and &s;trivings of the truly godly, that the word in the, original tran&s;lated <HI>strive,</HI> when u&s;ed in other places of the new te&s;tament, as it is often, ALWAYS DENOTES the exerci&s;es and labour of true chri&s;tians in their way to hea|ven.</Q> Upon which I would ob&s;erve, that if this be true, then the word <HI>strive</HI> is more appropriated to &s;incere chri&s;tians, than almo&s;t any other word in the bible; yea much more than <HI>&s;aith</HI> and <HI>repentance,</HI> &s;ince the &s;tony ground hearers <HI>believed</HI> for a while; Simon Magus <HI>believed</HI>; and the devils <HI>believe</HI>; and Judas <HI>repented</HI>; none of whom are &s;uppo&s;ed by orthodox divines to have been gracious.</P>
<P>However, let us examine the authorities which he has adduced to prove, that in the new te&s;tament the word &s;trive, ALWAYS DENOTES the exerci&s;es of true chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e is Paul's exhortation to Timothy, <Q>Fight the good fight of faith;</Q> and a &s;econd, what the &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;ays of him&s;elf, "I have fought the good fight." But in both the&s;e in&s;tances, that which limits the word <HI>fight</HI> or <HI>&s;trive,</HI> to the exerci&s;es of true chri&s;tians, is rather
<PB N="50" REF="010691_0060_0F81E2FC00428740">
the GOOD fight, with which it is connected. Whereas if Mr. Hopkins's &s;en&s;e of the word &s;trive, were certain, there had been no need at all for the apo&s;tle to have ad|ded, the GOOD &s;trife or fight &s;ince it could mean no|thing el&s;e, but a good and holy &s;triving. The&s;e two in|&s;tances then, &s;o far as I can di&s;cern, rather invalidate than prove his a&s;&s;ertion, &s;ince they &s;eem to imply there might be a fighting and &s;triving that was not thus &s;trict|ly good and &s;ucce&s;sful. King David danced in a holy manner before the ark, and he being an eminently good man, the word dancing is u&s;ed to denote his holy exer|ci&s;e. But will this prove, that the word dancing always denotes an holy, gracious exerci&s;e?</P>
<P>His next in&s;tance is, <Q>And every one that <HI>&s;triveth for the ma&s;tery,</HI> is temperate in all things: Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown,</Q> &amp;c. Here the apo&s;|tle &s;peaks of <HI>&s;triving</HI> for the ma&s;tery and for a corruptible crown. Were the&s;e gracious exerci&s;es? This text which he has produced, &s;eems to confute the interpretation he has advanced, in&s;tead of e&s;tabli&s;hing it.</P>
<P>It is, I apprehend, a matter of great importance, that the &s;criptures, and particularly, that this and the like pa&s;|&s;ages are not perverted. And if this perver&s;ion which, as it appears to me, is here given to this text, <HI>&s;trive to enter,</HI> &amp;c. &s;hould be received for truth, I cannot but think it would have a very bad tendency to encrea&s;e &s;ecurity and negligence about religion, and open profanene&s;s a|mong the unregenerate. For, according to him, if I under&s;tand him right, this text has no reference to any exerci&s;es, endeavours or duties performable by &s;inners while unregenerate, but entirely refers to the holy exer|ci&s;es of &s;incere chri&s;tians. Now if this text does not re|&s;pect the unconverted, and enjoin duties upon them, where can there be any pa&s;&s;age found in the bible that
<PB N="51" REF="010691_0061_0F81E2FCC00274E8">
has any reference to them? And if Chri&s;t never exhort|ed unconverted &s;inners to &s;trive and &s;eek for the grace of God, then there can be no good rea&s;on for their atten|dance on the go&s;pel, or performing any duties of religion immediate or pre&s;ent, nor &s;in in the omi&s;&s;ion of them, while they remain in unregeneracy. For where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Let this author produce &s;ome divine law, or exhortation, or command, requiring the duties, endeavours and exerci&s;es of the unregenerate, or &s;ay plainly, there is nothing required of them while in that &s;tate; and con&s;equently that all their religious en|deavours have no foundation but the commandments of men, and the mi&s;takes of mini&s;ters: For this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, if God has not required them.

<P>I pa&s;s on to his</P>
<P>Que&s;. II. <Q>Why are means to be u&s;ed, and what end does this an&s;wer? Or of what advantage is it to u&s;e means? What motive and encouragement is there to this?</Q> P. 121.</P>
<P>"It has been ob&s;erved," &s;ays the author, <Q>that the end of u&s;ing or attending on the means of grace is in&s;truction,</Q> &amp;c. By this in&s;truction, the author explains him&s;elf to mean &s;peculative knowledge, and what is &s;omething more, even all that light and know|ledge of divine things, that can agree to the unregene|rate.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 127, 128.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here I a&s;k leave to enquire, by what authority, this &s;peculative knowledge, even all that the unregenerate, as &s;uch, are capable of, is &s;et up as the end of attending on the means of grace? Doth not every one know, that the end of u&s;ing means to any purpo&s;e, is the accompli&s;hing that purpo&s;e? And is it not abundantly clear from the
<PB N="52" REF="010691_0062_0F81E2FD53916640">
&s;criptures, both of the old and new te&s;tament, that the end of attending on the means of grace, as appointed and required by God, is grace, the fruits of holine&s;s? Thus when God gives an account of the means and ad|vantages indulged to the jewi&s;h church, he expects fruits of holine&s;s, <Q>Wherefore, when I looked that it &s;hould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. v. 1,&mdash;6.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>So the great end and de&s;ign of the grace revealed in the go&s;pel, <Q>is to teach us, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 11.</NOTE></Q> So &s;trictly is this end enjoined us by God, in the u&s;e of all means and ad|vantages, arguments and motives, joyful and dreadful, &s;et before us in the go&s;pel, that 'tis on peril of our eter|nal damnation, if we fail of reaching this ble&s;&s;ed end. <Q>He that believeth not, &s;hall be damned.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 16.</NOTE> Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. xiii. 3.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e hints, and much more of the like nature, with which the &s;criptures abound, can any one, brought up under the go&s;pel, be at a lo&s;s, to what end God requires, him to attend on the means of grace?</P>
<P>Should it be objected here, in vindication of &s;etting up &s;peculative knowledge as the end of attending on the means of grace; that the unregenerate thro' moral pra|vity can go no further than &s;peculation, and that con|viction which is from a common work of the &s;pirit, till a new heart is given, in regeneration. I an&s;wer, be it &s;o; yet 'tis to be remembered, that God don't make the depraved will of the creature the rule of his duty: But, on the dreadful penalty, above expre&s;t, requires him to reach the appointed end. <Q>Make you a new heart, and a new &s;pirit, for why will ye die?

<P>The author having rai&s;ed the unregenerate to the high|e&s;t degree of an awakened &s;en&s;e of divine things, that their &s;tate, as &s;uch, is capable of, every thing as him&s;elf expre&s;&s;eth it, &s;hort of <Q>di&s;cerning the true beauty or moral excellency of divine things,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 723, 824.</NOTE></Q> He propo&s;es this query, viz. <Q>If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, what good all this in&s;truction and knowledge will do the unregenerate, who are under the dominion of an hard and impeni|tent heart, and will continue &s;o until a new heart is given in regeneration?</Q></P>
<P>Here let it be noted, that 'tis fully conceded by the author, that the unregenerate, under con&s;ideration, have all degrees of light and conviction of divine truth, that can, by a common work of the &s;pirit, agree to an unre|generate &s;tate. And therefore all that the three thou|sand pricked in the heart, at Peter's &s;ermon had,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act. ii. 37.</NOTE> and all that Paul had when &s;lain by the law,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ro. vii. 9.</NOTE> and all that the Publican had, who &s;tanding afar off, did not &s;o much as lift up his eyes to heaven, but &s;mote on his brea&s;t, &s;aying, God be merciful to me a &s;inner. All, I &s;ay, that the&s;e had, while unconverted, tho&s;e under con&s;ideration,

And in a word, all that there is in a common work of the &s;pirit of God, preparatory to a &s;aving faith, the inlightening of natural con&s;cience, put|ting the &s;inner upon reformation of life, a diligent atten|dance on means of grace, humbling him by the law, bringing of him to the foot of divine &s;overeignty, to a &s;en&s;e of his lo&s;t &s;tate, and the ju&s;tice of his condemna|tion by the law: All this is here fully comprehended.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the&s;e things, as preparatory to a &s;aving faith, in the ordinary way of God's di&s;pen&s;ing his grace, have been &s;teadily maintained by calvini&s;t divines of the greate&s;t note, as agreeable to the oracles of God.

But I forbear, as it is well known, that quotations on this head, from authors of greate&s;t note, might fill a large volume.</P>
<P>I wou'd be far from in&s;inuating, that the author has any inclination to favour the new divinity:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the new divinity here, I mean the divinity lately brought into the country, mentioned p. 5th, that intirely denies any preparatory work, in order to &s;aving faith, by the common influence of the &s;pirit; affirming, that the fir&s;t influence of the &s;pirit upon the &s;oul, is of a &s;aving nature; and that it can't be proved from the holy &s;criptures, that the &s;pirit of God ever &s;trives with the unregenerate.</NOTE> Yet at the &s;ame time, I mu&s;t own, I am not well able to account for his putting &s;o great a flight on all po&s;&s;ible attain|ments of the unregenerate, when at the &s;ame time, he mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, they contain in them, all that is prepara|tory to a &s;aving faith, by a common work of the &s;pirit of God.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="010691_0066_0F81E30028FF5898">And now let us attend to the forementioned queries. "If this knowledge," i.e. all that light, knowledge, conviction and legal humiliation, with all the proper ef|fects of it, in reformation and amendment of life, that can agree to the unregenerate, <Q>will be of no &s;ervice to them, and really do them no good, and they are as far from &s;alvation as ever.</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>For a clear under&s;tanding here, let it be noted,</P>
<P N="1">1. That when the author, in the&s;e queries, &s;peaks of being under the dominion of a hard and impenitent heart, it is evident from his own words, no more is meant than meerly continuing unregenerate, <Q>and will con|tinue so,</Q> i.e. under the dominion of a hard and im|penitent heart, <Q>until a new heart is given, in regene|ration.</Q> So when he &s;peaks of <Q>the impenitent &s;in|ners, continuing ob&s;tinately to reject and oppo&s;e &s;al|vation, offered in the go&s;pel,</Q> no more can be under|&s;tood, than continuing impenitent under the go&s;pel. To be &s;ure nothing can be under&s;tood here, by the &s;inners ob&s;tinately rejecting the go&s;pel &s;alvation, but what is con&s;i&s;tent with his &s;eeking the Lord with trembling, and reforming every known &s;in. Becau&s;e &s;uch are the &s;ub|ject of the pre&s;ent debate, and &s;uch he explains him&s;elf to mean, and of &s;uch 'tis a&s;&s;erted they are more vile, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I mention this, becau&s;e, as the author u&s;es the terms, they are equivocal: he mu&s;t, to be con&s;i&s;tent with him|&s;elf, mean no more than meerly continuing unregenerate, under the clear light of the go&s;pel; others under&s;tand by this phra&s;e, an open and avowed oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel, or what is nearly bordering upon it; which is &s;omething different from bare impenitence under the go&s;pel, accompanied with &s;eeking the Lord with trem|bling.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is to be noted here, that the author not only
<PB N="57" REF="010691_0067_0F81E300E6C717F0">
fully concedes to what is contained in the&s;e queries, but goes beyond, and a&s;&s;erts, not only that all the&s;e things will do the unregenerate no good; but that on the whole, they are more vile in God's &s;ight, with all the&s;e attain|ments, than they would be without them.</P>
<P>And is not all this &s;trange! Is it of no &s;ervice, on the whole, to the unregenerate, to be broken off from &s;trong habits of mo&s;t enormous wickedne&s;s, tho' only from na|tural con&s;cience awakened? Is it of no &s;ervice to them, to have attained that &s;peculative knowledge, without which, as the author ob&s;erves, the &s;inner can't be rege|nerated? Again, is it of no &s;ervice to the unregenerate, to be humbled and &s;lain by the law, convinced of their lo&s;t and peri&s;hing &s;tate, and of the ju&s;tice of God in their condemnation? In a word, is all that is done by the &s;pirit of God, for the unregenerate, preparatory to a &s;av|ing faith, on the whole, of no u&s;e at all to them?</P>
<P>But to &s;peak of things more di&s;tinctly, I fully concede, there is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, nothing that is holy, &s;piritual or plea&s;ing to God, nothing that &s;tands in connexion with any promi&s;e of, that might recommend the &s;inner to God's &s;pecial favour, in all the&s;e or the like attain|ments. But here I</P>
<P>Query, 1. Is there therefore, really no fort of good|ne&s;s, of any kind, or in any &s;en&s;e whatsoever, in all the&s;e, or the like attainments of the unregenerate, when con|&s;idered in them&s;elves, not &s;o much as that of a negative kind, which con&s;i&s;ts in the ab&s;ence of a greater degree of po&s;itive moral evil? If &s;o: It mu&s;t clearly follow,</P>
<P N="1">1. That this truth ought to be taught with the great|e&s;t plainne&s;s, and enforced in the &s;tronge&s;t manner upon all: The mo&s;t profligate mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ured, that he is not a whit more wicked, than the mo&s;t reformed, awakened &s;inner, under the &s;ame external means of light. And
<PB N="58" REF="010691_0068_0F81E3019842C8F0">
here it can't be denied, but that the author has &s;o far di&s;charged him&s;elf well, upon this principle, as that, tho' he has not in expre&s;s words a&s;&s;erted this; yet he has been effectually cautious, not to hint a word to the contrary, throughout this whole &s;ection, when there was the faire&s;t occa&s;ion, and whil&s;t he laboured abundantly to prove, that the reformed, on the whole, is more vile than the profligate.</P>
<P N="2">2. It clearly follows, on this principle, that the pro|fligate may, by no means, be exhorted to break off his &s;ins, and reform his life, with any view to his being le&s;s wicked. That to have any re&s;pect to this, in breaking off his &s;ins, if he fails of doing it in a gracious manner, is to act upon a fal&s;e principle: That however a wran|gling con&s;cience may &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a notion, it is utterly fal&s;e: And that he may &s;afely, in the fear of God, wrangle it out, with his mi&s;informed con&s;cience, and be a&s;&s;ured he is not a whit more wicked, continuing his execrable practices, than he would be, if he reformed them!</P>
<P>Here again, it mu&s;t be own'd, the author has acted in a fair con&s;i&s;tency with this principle: Since, thro' this whole &s;ection, he has not &s;o much as once mentioned the &s;inner's breaking off from his &s;ins, as that, whereby he is more in the way of mercy, or le&s;s wicked, than going on in them. All that belongs to the unregene|rate, as means, with the author, it &s;eems, terminates in in&s;truction or &s;peculative knowledge; as tho' it was not as much out of God's wonted way, to be&s;tow &s;aving grace on the &s;inner, abandoned to all kind of wickedne&s;s, while &s;uch, as on the gro&s;sly ignorant.</P>
<P N="3">3. Upon this principle, all the attainments of the un|regenerate, &s;uch as awakening, conviction, reformation, legal humiliation, and what&s;oever is preparatory to a
<PB N="59" REF="010691_0069_0F81E302F3986790">
&s;aving faith, are no grounds at all of thankfulne&s;s to God. If they are really &s;uch worthle&s;s things, what are of no &s;ervice to the unregenerate, can do them no good, and on the account of which, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, they are not le&s;s wicked, than they would be without them, abandoning them&s;elves to all manner of wicked|ne&s;s; in this ca&s;e, to give thanks to God for them, would be no le&s;s than to mock God, giving thanks, for a thing of nought.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the truth really is, that all the&s;e attainments of the unregenerate, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, tho' but the fruits of common grace, are great and pre|cious favours from God, endearing grounds of thankful|ne&s;s, whereby they are le&s;s wicked, and, in the true &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, in &s;tate brought nearer to the kingdom of God, to a &s;tate of grace, the &s;tate of a good man, than when, in a great mea&s;ure, carnally &s;ecure and thoughtle&s;s about the concerns of their &s;ouls, and wallowing in all manner of mo&s;t abominable wickedne&s;s, under the &s;ame external means of light. If this, I &s;ay, be the truth, handed down from the reformation, through the hands of eminent divines, as it now &s;tands in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, as quoted above; why was it not fairly brought out, on this &s;pecial occa&s;ion, and &s;et in a clear light? Why does the author artfully conceal it, thro' this whole di&s;cour&s;e, treating of it in a &s;ort of a compound &s;en&s;e? Was it fear, le&s;t &s;inners &s;hould make a righteou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e things, if in any &s;en&s;e &s;poke well of? Have mor|tals a right to be &s;o much afraid of the abu&s;e of any of God's truths, as to conceal them, when the &s;ubject treat|ed on, &s;o e&s;pecially requires it? Again,</P>
<P>Be it &s;o, that by all the&s;e attainments, as above, the unregenerate have no moral fitne&s;s to receive grace, no|thing that in the lea&s;t intitles, or recommends them to
<PB N="60" REF="010691_0070_0F81E30391617E50">
the favour of God. Is it therefore true, that they have no fort of fitne&s;s in any &s;en&s;e? Is it not bold for crea|tures to a&s;&s;ert this; when 'tis evident from &s;cripture and the experience of the godly, that 'tis the way, the wi&s;dom of God in the ordinary way of di&s;pen&s;ing his grace, takes, to bring home &s;ouls to Chri&s;t, to wound before he heals, convince of &s;in before he convinces of righteou&s;ne&s;s? Is it not rea&s;onable to think, if we were angels and not men, we &s;hould &s;ee many u&s;eful di&s;tinc|tions we have no clear di&s;cernment of now? Ought it not therefore, to be a &s;ufficient guard to us, when we &s;ee the wi&s;dom of God takes this or that method to accom|pli&s;h any certain purpo&s;e, not to a&s;&s;ert there is no fitne&s;s in it, becau&s;e we don't clearly di&s;cern it? Are we &s;ure there is no fitne&s;s in this order of proceeding, that the &s;inner &s;hould fir&s;t be made &s;en&s;ible of the dreadful ma|je&s;ty of God &s;inned again&s;t, and &s;o of the dreadful de&s;ert of &s;in, and of the utter ruin of his nature by it, before the way of pardon is opened up to him thro' a mediator?</P>
<P>But to return to the queries.</P>
<P>That which is not the lea&s;t remarkable, is that after all the&s;e attainments, as above, the unregenerate are as far from &s;alvation as ever. Where it may be ob&s;erved, that expre&s;&s;ion here u&s;ed, "as far from &s;alvation as ever," can hardly, with &s;trict propriety, be under&s;tood to relate to the time of the &s;inner's being brought into a &s;tate of grace; becau&s;e &s;uch a time might never come; and if it did, the propo&s;ition wou'd not be true: Becau&s;e, in that ca&s;e, every day brings the &s;inner one day nearer to &s;alvation. It mu&s;t therefore relate to the &s;tate of the &s;inner, as being in &s;tate as far from &s;alvation as ever. And can this be true, when all that is preparatory to a &s;aving faith is already wrought in the &s;oul? Is the tim|ber that is fell, hew'd and drawn to the place, in &s;tate, as
<PB N="61" REF="010691_0071_0F81E303D970E0E0">
far from that of being wrought into a frame, as the &s;tand|ing trees? Equally evident and certain it is, that every degree of knowledge, conviction, reformation, legal hu|miliation, &amp;c. attained by the unregenerate, that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;tate of grace and &s;alvation, brings them in &s;tate one degree nearer to it; whether ever they attain it or not.</P>
<P>I might here go on to remark on &s;undry pa&s;&s;ages, which, to my weak under&s;tanding, are not well expre&s;t; but being much of the &s;ame nature with what has been touch'd upon, and in the main, comprehended in the general propo&s;ition, di&s;cour&s;ed upon above, I &s;hall pa&s;s them, &s;ave a hint on what the author &s;eems to de&s;ign as a &s;imilitude, for the illu&s;tration of the truth of the affir|mative part of the que&s;tion, viz. <Q>If a father calls after, and commands his two &s;ons, who are running from him with a de&s;ign to quit his family and government, as what they perfectly hate, immediately to return back, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to his authority. If they ought to obey their father's command, then they are under obligation to &s;top, and attend to what he has to &s;ay. For this is implied in what he requires, and nece&s;&s;ary in order to it. Therefore if one turns about, and attends to what his father has to &s;ay to him, while the other &s;tops his ears, and runs on, till he is out of hearing; the former does not violate the obligation to &s;top and hearken, which the other does, tho' if he continues to hate his father, and refu&s;es to return and &s;ubmit to his government, he can't be &s;aid to obey his father's command; and may by the light and conviction laid before him, by his father, in con&s;e|quence of his &s;topping and attending, be more guilty in refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to him, than the other that has been out of hearing.</Q> To this I reply,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="62" REF="010691_0072_0F81E30560C67CD8">1. That this &s;imilitude does by no means fully repre|&s;ent the &s;tate of the ca&s;e: Here is nothing of the awaken|ed, reformed &s;inner, &s;ave only his making a pau&s;e, &s;top|ping his career, when running away, and attending to what his father had to &s;ay. Yet lame and defective as it is, I propo&s;e a query or two: And for di&s;tinction fake, Let the letter A. repre&s;ent the &s;on that run off, and B. him that turn'd back, and attended to what his father had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I a&s;k, what was the true cau&s;e and rea&s;on why A. &s;topt his ears, run off, and utterly refu&s;ed to hear a word from his father, or pay him the lea&s;t regard; when B. heark|ened &s;o far, as to &s;top his wicked cour&s;e, and attend to the rea&s;ons his father had to offer, for his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? Both were alike well educated, by their father, alike well u&s;ed, under equal advantages, and obligations. All the&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed. What therefore can be the true cau&s;e and rea&s;on of this difference, but a more wicked &s;tate of mind in A? What, but a greater degree of ob|duracy and hardne&s;s of heart; a more fixed re&s;olution of rebellion, and of ca&s;ting the utmo&s;t contempt on his father's authority? Will any one in this view of the ca&s;e, &s;ay, that B. is more wicked than A? What! becau&s;e B. is le&s;s bold, daring and fixed in his rebellion, and in ca&s;t|ing the utmo&s;t contempt on his father's authority? Sure neither &s;cripture nor rea&s;on will admit this &s;entiment. Should it be pleaded here, that B. is more wicked than A.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e B. di&s;covers a greater degree of tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience &s;inned again&s;t, than A. in non &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that to argue thus, wou'd be prepo&s;terous and ab&s;urd to the la&s;t degree. For, upon this principle, the mo&s;t abandoned &s;inner under the go&s;pel, having wa&s;ted his con&s;cience, and &s;inned away his <HI>moral &s;en&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="010691_0073_0F81E3063AD37A90">
&s;o that he is pa&s;t feeling, as the &s;cripture expre&s;&s;eth it, may commit the mo&s;t atrocious wickedne&s;s, and yet be innocent, becau&s;e pa&s;t feeling. Whereas the truth in this ca&s;e is ju&s;t the rever&s;e; he, of the two, under the &s;ame go&s;pel light and advantages, that can with the great|e&s;t boldne&s;s and freedom, commit the mo&s;t enormous wickedne&s;s, without remor&s;e or feeling of con&s;cience, is the more de&s;perately wicked. As is evidently the ca&s;e with A.</P>
<P>But perhaps the grand plea in re&s;erve, to evince that B. is more faulty than A. (if different from what has already been &s;aid) is, that B. has a higher degree of in|ternal light and conviction, that 'tis his duty to &s;ubmit to his father, than A. had, therefore more guilty.</P>
<P>By way of reply,</P>
<P>I a&s;k, what is the blameable cau&s;e, why A. has not as great a degree of internal light and conviction of his duty in this matter, as B? If it be intirely and meerly A's fault, &s;hall not A. be dealt with, as if he had that light and conviction in his con&s;cience; which only, and meerly his own fault, wilfully &s;topping his ears, impeaded his having?&mdash;Is not this point already determined by un|ering wi&s;dom, in the ca&s;e of our Saviour's treating the jews, above cited; when upon doing the works among them that none other man did; Chri&s;t charges them with having both &s;een and hated both him and the father. Where it does not appear, that they actually &s;aw the divinity of Chri&s;t, and therein the glory of the Father that &s;hone forth in his works; but thro' the exceeding wickedne&s;s, blindne&s;s, and prejudice of their hearts, meer|ly their own faultine&s;s, they were, as to many of them, no doubt, blind to, and did not perceive, but rejected the demon&s;trative light of Chri&s;t's divinity, that &s;hone in his works. And &s;o were reckoned with by God, as if
<PB N="64" REF="010691_0074_0F81E306D6D6C958">
they had &s;een it; becau&s;e nothing but their own meer faultine&s;s prevented it.</P>
<P>Now it this be true, applied to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and A, be accountable before God as &s;inning again&s;t all that light, which he wilfully refu&s;ed, by &s;hutting his eyes and &s;topping his ears; how can B. be chargeable with &s;inning again&s;t a greater degree of light, than A? If it can't therefore be affirmed with truth, of B. repre&s;enting the awakened, reformed &s;inner, that he is in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e, on the whole, undoubtedly more vile, odious, and abominable in God's &s;ight than A. repre&s;enting the bold, daring, pre&s;umptuous &s;inner, going on re&s;olutely in his &s;ins; the author's cau&s;e mu&s;t fail, as repre&s;ented by this &s;imilitude of his own chu&s;ing. Becau&s;e this is abun|dantly affirmed by the author, of the awakened, reform|ed &s;inner, compared with the &s;ecure going on in his &s;ins, as the grand foundation of this debate, as &s;een above.</P>
<P>However, let us hear what the author him&s;elf faith, "If" (&s;ays he) "he," i.e. the &s;on that turned about, <Q>continues to hate his father, and refu&s;es to return and &s;ubmit to his government, he may by the light and conviction laid before him by his father, in con&s;e|quence of his &s;topping and attending, be more guilty in refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to him, than the other, who has been out of hearing.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable here, that the author has &s;aid nothing of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of B. under conviction, as being more guilty than A. who &s;topt his ears, and run off. Nor is it to be attributed to any want of ingenuity in the author. For who does not &s;ee, that any thing of this nature here a&s;&s;erted, wou'd be even &s;hocking to common &s;en&s;e? In|&s;tead therefore, of any thing of this nature, he &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome future &s;ea&s;on, con&s;equent on B's attending on his father's in&s;truction, in which he might, by light
<PB N="65" REF="010691_0075_0F81E3090AD521E0" MS="y">
laid before him, be more guilty in refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit, than A. out of hearing. Which is but a meer &s;uppo&s;i|tion of a may be, relating to futurity. And &s;o nothing to the purpo&s;e, &s;ince, &s;o long as there is any in&s;tance of a &s;inner under the go&s;pel, awakened from a &s;ecure, pro|fligate, vicious life, to a diligent attendance on the means of grace, that is not, on the whole, more vile in God's &s;ight, than he wou'd be, continuing &s;ecure, going on in his &s;ins, as the above in&s;tance is a plain one, the general propo&s;ition can't be true. However, the following que|ries are propo&s;ed to the author, on what he hath here &s;aid.</P>
<P>Q. 1. What moment of future time, may be fixed upon, when B. as repre&s;ented in the &s;imilitude above, I will be more guilty than A? If it be not true now: may not the &s;ame rea&s;ons for which it is now true, remain and increa&s;e, &s;o that it may never be true?</P>
<P>Q. 2d. Whether this way of rea&s;oning in favour of A. as tho' he might expect &s;ome notable abatement of his guilt, by &s;topping his ears and going out of hearing, don't carry in it too much encouragement to the &s;inners A. repre&s;ents, who abandon them&s;elves to wickedne&s;s, and neglect the means of grace: Since they are &s;uffici|ently inclined in them&s;elves, without the help of others, to devi&s;e pleas in their own favour?</P>
<P>Another pa&s;&s;age is, <Q>If the plowing of the wicked is &s;in, &s;hall they therefore not plow?</Q>&mdash;Where it may be ob&s;erved, that this pa&s;&s;age was brought in by the au|thor, to illu&s;trate his point, as &s;een from the connexion, viz. that the awakened, reformed &s;inners being, on the whole, more vile, &amp;c. is no rea&s;on why they &s;hould ne|glect means.</P>
<P N="2">2. That a part only is here put, for the whole &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and therefore can be no illu&s;tration of the point. The whole &s;tate of the ca&s;e being put, &s;tands thus, viz.
<PB N="66" REF="010691_0076_0F81E30A1F18D0C0">
Whether on &s;uppo&s;ition, the &s;inner awakened from &s;loth and negligence, to plow and u&s;e proper means to provide &s;u&s;tenance for him&s;elf and family, being, on the whole, wor&s;e, than he would have been, had he continued in &s;loth and negligence, under the &s;ame external means of light, the que&s;tion in this ca&s;e is, whether he &s;hall plow, i.e. whether, if providing for his family, he is, on the whole, wor&s;e than wor&s;e than an infidel; becau&s;e while he neglected providing for his family, we are divinely a&s;&s;ured he was wor&s;e than an infidel, &s;o that if he be wor&s;e now, providing for them, than he was neglecting of them, he mu&s;t be wor&s;e than wor&s;e than an infidel.</P>
<P>And now let the reader judge, the ca&s;e being fairly &s;tated, whether he &s;hall plow in this ca&s;e; and whether the ca&s;e only in part, put as above, can at all &s;erve to illu&s;trate the author's point?</P>
<P>There is one thing more, which I &s;hall but touch upon, and that is the remarkable variation of expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by the author, relating to the main point in debate. Thus while he repeatedly a&s;&s;erts, that the awakened, re|formed &s;inner, while impenitent, is on the whole, by light received, more vile and odious in God's &s;ight, than he wou'd be continuing in &s;ecurity, and going on in his &s;ins: And that he is undoubtedly &s;o, what ever be his reformation and amendment of life, as quoted and ex|plained above; undoubtedly, that is, unavoidably; for if his greater &s;infulne&s;s might po&s;&s;ibly be avoided in this ca&s;e, the matter would be brought into doubt, and then he would not be undoubtedly more vile. With the&s;e and the like declarations, are intermixed &s;ome &s;oftening expre&s;&s;ions, viz. that the &s;inner is &s;o in a re&s;pect, com|monly, and for the mo&s;t part; and in the clo&s;e of his di&s;cour&s;e, he comes down wonderfully, in the&s;e words, viz. <Q><HI>His appearing to him&s;elf</HI> to grow wor&s;e&mdash;is really
<PB N="67" REF="010691_0077_0F81E30ADA5DD120">
no rea&s;on why he &s;hould neglect means, but rather an encouragement con&s;tantly to attend.</Q> Fully orthodox this. But why this abatement? If the principle advanc|ed in former pages is true; why not thro' the whole? If it was of importance to be &s;et up; why not to be kept up, e&s;pecially in the clo&s;e? Which if it had, wou'd have &s;tood thus, viz. The awakened &s;inner's <HI>really</HI> grow|ing wor&s;e, on the whole, in attendance on means, as con|viction of &s;in ari&s;es, what ever be his reformation and amendment of life, and what ever his humiliation prepa|ratory to coming to Chri&s;t, more vile, odious and abo|minable in God's &s;ight, than he would have been con|tinuing &s;ecure, and going on in the practice of all manner of mo&s;t enormous wickedne&s;s, under the &s;ame external means of light, <Q>is really no rea&s;on why he &s;hould ne|glect means; but rather an encouragement con&s;tantly to attend.</Q> Now if in the author's view, it appeared too &s;tartling to a common reader, to clo&s;e his di&s;cour&s;e with this plain repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of the ca&s;e in debate: It had been a great favour, in my humble opi|nion, if he had been under the &s;ame re&s;traint, when he advanced it. To be &s;ure it had prevented me the&s;e my poor labours on the &s;ubject. And I think I may &s;ay with good a&s;&s;urance, it had prevented grief to many wor|thy fathers in the mini&s;try, who&s;e prai&s;e is in the go&s;pel thro' the churches; and who are not &s;o far <HI>&s;uperannuated,</HI> but that with good old Eli, they tremble for fear of the ark; when they &s;ee it in danger of a wrong touch, from the vigour and &s;prightline&s;t of younger years.</P>
<P>I proceed to the</P>
<P>VI. General head propo&s;ed, which was to con&s;ider such objections as might ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Here, before I enter upon the objections, I de&s;ire it may be well ob&s;erved, that as the author don't confine

What I chiefly aim at here, is, that nothing in the objections, be by the reader attributed to the au|thor, but what evidently appears to be advanced by him, or in favour of what is advanced by him.</P>
<P>Obj. I. Should it be objected here, by the way, that in what is advanced in this di&s;cour&s;e, as matter of debate from the tenth &s;ection, things are carried too high, be|yond the genuine &s;en&s;e and meaning of the author's expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, it was with the &s;tricte&s;t caution I proceeded in that matter, to the be&s;t of my under&s;tanding and not without the concurring thoughts of many, who are look|ed upon among the best judges of language.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I have fairly expo&s;ed the author's own words, to be judged by the impartial public; and might further add from the drift and &s;cope of the whole, and from many conce&s;&s;ions and after expre&s;&s;ions, what to me ap|pears a full confirmation, that the true &s;en&s;e and meaning of the author's words, is well expre&s;t in what is &s;aid; were it not that I am confident he will not in&s;i&s;t on this objection.</P>
<P>Obj. II. Is it not clear, both from &s;cripture and rea&s;on, that &s;in is aggravated according to the degree of light &s;inned again&s;t?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, It is readily granted, that he that &s;ins again&s;t a greater degree of light, is in that re&s;pect, a greater &s;in|ner: But then it by no means &s;hould follow, that he is &s;o, on the whole, all other re&s;pects con&s;idered. As has been clearly &s;hew'd above, To which I refer the reader.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="010691_0079_0F81E30C4D3921C0">Obj. III. 'Tis objected by &s;ome, that to urge &s;inners to a diligent attendance on particular duties, &s;uch as &s;earching the &s;criptures, attending on the word preached, &s;trictne&s;s in reforming known &s;in, and practi&s;ing known duty, with earne&s;t cries to &s;overeign grace, as means in order to faith, is not &s;criptural. That the only &s;criptu|ral way of putting men upon attending on means, is to call upon them to repent and believe the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the purport of the author's an&s;wer to the third que&s;tion, viz. <Q>What obligations are men un|der to u&s;e means? An&s;. They &s;eem to be under the &s;ame obligations to this, as they are to repent and be|lieve the go&s;pel.</Q> And having confirmed his an&s;wer, he makes this ob&s;ervation, viz. <Q>That this is the &s;crip|tural way of calling upon men to attend means, viz. to call on them to repent and believe the go&s;pel.</Q> It is not here &s;aid, this is one &s;criptural way: But it &s;eems plainly meant to be under&s;tood, that this is the only &s;criptural way: Becau&s;e, if the author knew any &s;ingle text, that pointed out any particular duty, as a means, having undertook to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, as above, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed he would have adduced it.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">What I call the new divinity, utterly di&s;cards all notion of &s;inners being exhorted to any particular duties, as means in order to faith.

<P>Now if the author is here rightly under&s;tood, this is &s;omething of the &s;ame nature with what was attempted on Luk. xiii. 24.

This wou'd be doing bu&s;ine&s;s! But is it true? Does not our Saviour expre&s;sly injoin &s;inners to &s;earch the &s;criptures

<P>It is untrue to object here, that as Simon is directed fir&s;t to repent, he is directed to pray, only on &s;uppo&s;ition, he did truly repent: Since after all, the encouragement &s;et before him to pray, is encouragement peculiar to a &s;in|ner's prayer.

pray. Is there nothing in all the&s;e that relates to the &s;inners attending on any particular duty, as a means in order to obtain grace?</P>
<P>Can any art of metaphy&s;icks wrangle away all the&s;e and many more plain texts, that might be brought to the &s;ame purpo&s;e? I &s;ay all: Becau&s;e if there be but one &s;ingle text in the whole bible, that points out any duty to be done by the unregenerate, as a means in order to &s;aith, the point is gained. And will any one deny this? Deny that there is any one duty appointed by God to be attended by the unregenerate, being of his vi&s;ible cove|nant people, as means in order to obtain his &s;aving mer|cy! And if not: Sure there are other &s;criptural ways of calling upon men to attend on means of grace, than meerly by calling upon them to repent and believe the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Again, it is evident from the la&s;t text mentioned, that &s;inners are encouraged to &s;uch religious exerci&s;es as they are capable of, being unregenerate, as means in order to obtain grace. Thus Simon a &s;inner is encouraged to pray, (which the author owns in capitals is a means of grace) tho' it &s;hould be the prayer of the unregenerate.</P>
<P>This will be evident, if we con&s;ider the encourage|ment here &s;et before Simon to pray, mu&s;t be encourage|ment either to the prayer of a &s;aint, or a &s;inner: But a meer paradventure or may be of forgivene&s;s, as contained in tho&s;e words, can't be the &s;criptural encouragement to the prayer of a &s;aint: to &s;uppo&s;e this, would be to contra|dict the current of the whole &s;cripture.

<P>One principal de&s;ign of the text, above quoted, as it appears to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, is to point out to us, that God's ordinary and appointed was of di&s;per&s;ing his &s;aving mercy to his covenant people, is that of their earne&s;t cries to God for it in a diligent attendance on all appointed means; not that tis be&s;towed for their &s;eeking, praying and &s;triving, but in that way. I am therefore &s;o unhappy, as to fall under an ap|prehen&s;ion, that both the doctor, and Mr. Hopkins, as they have mi&s;t this &s;en&s;e, have mi&s;t one main de&s;ign of the text; the one going into one extreme, the other into the other. The doctor on the one hand, mak|ing too much of the &s;inner's &s;eeking to God, in the diligent u&s;e of means, as though there was in it &s;omething that is holy and &s;piritual in a lower degree, and &s;omething that &s;tands in connection with promi&s;es, of the be&s;towment of &s;aving grace. On the other hand, Mr. Hopkins makes too little of it, as tho' becau&s;e it was not holy, or connected with promi&s;es; therefore it was quite nothing at all, not &s;o much as the way in which God ordinarily di&s;pen&s;es his &s;aving mercy. Ac|cordingly he ab&s;olutely excludes it from any notice at all in the text; which evidently refers to great numbers of the I&s;raelites, that were a|bout to partake of regenerating grace; and which declares, God will be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them; i. e. to be&s;tow this regenerating grace. Whether of the&s;e extremes are furthe&s;t from the true &s;en&s;e of the text, I will not undertake to &s;ay. But that both are wide of it, will appear, if the &s;en&s;e of the text, as propo&s;ed above, can be made good; which I &s;hall attempt from the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the word in the original, here rendered <HI>this,</HI> or <HI>for this,</HI> an|&s;wers to the lattin pronoun relative hoc, and evidently relates to all the ble&s;&s;ings mentioned in the preceeding ver&s;es of the context, from ver. 25, both of a &s;piritual and temporal nature, the whole good of the co|venant is rapt up in the &s;ingle particle <HI>this.</HI> What I chiefly have my eye upon, as more to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, is a prediction of the be|&s;towment of regenerating grace on the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, amply declared ver. 25, on to the end of the 28.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The word in the original, here render'd <HI>yet,</HI> an&s;wers to the latin adverb, adhuc, and is righty render'd by <HI>yet,</HI> or <HI>yet &s;till,</HI> and is nearly the &s;ame in &s;ignification with <HI>neverthele&s;s,</HI> or <HI>notwith&s;tanding</HI>; as the&s;e engli&s;hes, <HI>yet, but yet, bowbeit,</HI> are &s;ound joined in company with <HI>tho&s;e</HI> under <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">amen,</HI> which &s;hews a near affinity between them, in &s;igni|fication. Now in order to a clear under&s;tanding of this text, it ap|pears to be of importance to enquire, what tho&s;e things are, notwith|&s;tanding which, or that have after them a <HI>yet &s;till,</HI> God will be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, they are all tho&s;e things in general, that are or can be objected, with any &s;hew of excu&s;ing the unregenerate among God's vi&s;ible covenant people, from &s;eeking to God in the diligent u&s;e of means for regenerating grace, e&s;pecially things mentioned in the context. Particularly, &s;hould it be objected, that God the Son hath by his death made the purcha&s;e, and paid down the full price of the&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. That God the Father hath promi&s;ed in the cove|nant of redemption, the be&s;towment of them: and that, he hath re|vealed this his purpo&s;e of grace to men, and predicted the certain ac|compli&s;hment of it, as in the context. Why then (may it be &s;aid) mo&s;t &s;inners &s;eek to God in the u&s;e of means for it? The an&s;wer is full in the text, <HI>yet &s;till</HI> God will be enquired of, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again, &s;hould it be objected, that the be&s;towment of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings is a meer flow of &s;elf-moving &s;overeign goodne&s;s, without any the lea&s;t de|&s;ert or worthine&s;s in the &s;inner, moving thereto; nay, the prayers cries, and what&s;oever el&s;e the unregenerate are capable of, in the u&s;e of means, are all vile, odious and abominable in God's &s;ight, as it is for &s;ub&s;tance repeated, and emphatically expre&s;t in the context, v. 22, and 32, "Not for your &s;akes do I this, &s;aith the Lord God, be it known unto you. Be a&s;hamed, and con&s;ounded for your own ways, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael." <HI>Yet &s;till</HI> for this, i. e. for the be&s;towment of the&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, will I be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them, &s;aith the Lord God. As if the Almighty had &s;aid, <Q>All this, and whatever el&s;e can be objected in this ca&s;e, I am perfectly ac|quainted with; I know the &s;infulne&s;s of my people to the uttermo&s;t, as to their &s;tate, and how vile they will be in every &s;tep they take, in the u&s;e of means till their hearts are chang'd; and <HI>yet &s;till,</HI> it was my plea&s;ure to fix upon this way, as the order of my ordinary proceed|ing in di&s;pen&s;ing &s;aving mercy to them. I have in&s;tituted and ap|pointed means, to be attended on by them to that end; and am un|changeably determined, ordinarily not to recede from the word, that is gone out of my mouth, or to counteract my own appointment by giving &s;aving mercy to them, but in the way of being enquired of, to do it for them.</Q> Again,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It might be further ob&s;erved here, that the&s;e words, as well as the promi&s;e of regenerating grace, are &s;poken by way of prediction; they are a prediction or prophecy of what God would do for I&s;rael, and of what I&s;rael &s;hould be brought to do, by a common work of God's &s;pirit, not as a condition, but as that whereby they &s;hould be brought in to the way, in which God is plea&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e his &s;aving mercy to his covenant people. As if the Lord had &s;aid, <Q>As for I&s;rael my covenant people, they have by a long continued cour&s;e of mo&s;t a|bominable wickedne&s;s, reduced them&s;elves to an amazing degree of &s;tupidity and hardne&s;s of heart, and to the utter neglect of my ordi|nances: Yet, as I have determined their recovery, by un&s;eigned re|pentance, I will open their blind eyes, awaken natural con&s;cience, &s;eing their &s;ins to remembrance in their di&s;tre&s;s; rank them in order before them, and cau&s;e them under a feeling &s;en&s;e of their guilt and peri&s;hing condition, to bemoan them&s;elves, and cry to me for mercy, in a diligent attendance on means.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the plain &s;en&s;e of this text, if allowed to &s;peak for it&s;elf, free from all force put upon it by human art, is, that God's ordinary ap|pointed way of di&s;pen&s;ing &s;aving mercy to his covenant people is their earne&s;t &s;eeking to him for it, in a diligent attendance on all appointed means as above.</P>
<P>Moreover, that the &s;en&s;e of this text, as held forth above, is the true and genuine &s;en&s;e, may be further argued from the following particu|lars.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That it flows naturally from the words, without any manner of force, according to &s;trict propriety of language: Whereas great im|propriety attends fixing the other &s;en&s;e upon them, as will be obvious to every one, by putting the ca&s;e. And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in the latter &s;en&s;e, I will yet for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, i. e. by the godly few, (perhaps one in a thou&s;and, or ten thou&s;and, in a time of &s;uch deep and univer&s;al corruption) to do it for them, i. e. to be&s;tow on tho&s;e godly few, a new heart. But what heart mu&s;t that be? &s;ure it mu&s;t differ e&s;&s;entially from the new heart, they had received, whereby they became &s;aints; otherwi&s;e it could not be new: Or the con&s;truction mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> thus, to do it for them, i. e. not for them, but for others, that were unregenerate, Can either of the&s;e be the true con&s;truction of the&s;e &s;acred words? Certain it is, the former can't: Becau&s;e in what ever &s;en&s;e, a new heart may be further given to the godly; yet that could by no means an&s;wer the prediction, which evidently relates to a great number of the I&s;raelites being bro't to true repentance, and to the body of that people's being reformed. Or can the latter of the&s;e be true, to do it for them, i. e. not for them; but for others, for tho&s;e wicked I&s;raelites, about to partake of regene|rating grace? If either of the&s;e be fixed upon; where is the propriety or con&s;i&s;tency? Whereas, under&s;tanding the&s;e words in the &s;en&s;e above, I am contending for; they run &s;mooth, and free from that impropriety and force, otherwi&s;e involved in them, viz. that God's ordinary ap|pointed way of di&s;pen&s;ing &s;aving mercy to his covenant people, is that of their earne&s;t &s;eeking to him, in a diligent attendance on all ap|pointed means, that he would be&s;tow it on them.</P>
<P>One thing that I would here a little in&s;i&s;t on, is, that the &s;ame &s;inners, that are here comprehended under this phra&s;e, <HI>the hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> from v. 17, down to the text under con&s;ideration; and under this phra&s;e charged with having defiled their own land, before they went into captivity; and with having prophaned God's name among the heathen; and under this phra&s;e, have the be&s;towment of God's &s;aving mercy pro|mi&s;ed to them; and are a&s;&s;ured by God, under this phra&s;e, that it was not for their &s;akes, that he was about to be&s;tow the&s;e great and un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ings; that the &s;ame per&s;ons mu&s;t, in all fairne&s;s of con&s;truction, be &s;till under&s;tood as meant and intended, under the &s;ame phra&s;e u&s;ed in the text, when 'tis &s;aid, I will yet for this be enquir|ed of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them. At lea&s;t they mu&s;t not be excluded.</P>
<P>This, Mr. Hopkins denies; and makes it the bu&s;ine&s;s of a large di&s;cour&s;e on this text, to prove, that &s;eeking God in the text, to do it for them; mu&s;t be under&s;tood of &s;eeking with a new heart, exclu&s;ive of any kind of &s;eeking of the&s;e poor peri&s;hing I&s;raelites, that were about to be made partakers of &s;aving mercy.</P>
<P>Sec, VI. p. 61,&mdash;70.</P>
<P>The enquiry here is, what good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why the &s;ame phra&s;e &s;hould not be of the &s;ame import, and have the &s;ame reference when u&s;ed in the text, as it hath in every other in&s;tance, in which it is u&s;ed down thro' the context? E&s;pecially &s;ince it don't appear, that ever it was once u&s;ed in the holy &s;criptures to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;aints from &s;inners.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That the &s;en&s;e of the text as above expre&s;t, is the true and genuine &s;en&s;e of the words, may be argued, not only becau&s;e it flows naturally from them, free of all impropriety and force; but in regard the words taken in this &s;en&s;e, hold forth an important truth. The former of the&s;e hath been &s;een above. The only point that remains to be proved is, that God's ordinary appointed way of di&s;pen&s;ing &s;aving mercy to his covenant people, is that of their earne&s;t &s;eeking to him for it, in a diligent attendance on all appointed means.</P>
<P>The truth of which I take to be too evident to need any laborious proof. For,</P>
<P>(1) If God hath appointed prayer, and other means of grace to be earne&s;tly attended on by the unregenerate among his covenant people, as the way, in order to obtain his &s;aving mercy; it can't agree to his infinite perfections to unravel his own work in this ca&s;e, and counteract him&s;elf in his own appointment, by ordinarily granting &s;aving mercy out of this his own appointed way, either to tho&s;e that wholly neglect the means of grace, or with great remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, carele&s;ne&s;s and indiferen|cy attend upon them. So that if God has appointed means of grace, as above, as it is certain he hath, (otherwi&s;e he had not &s;o &s;ignally blamed his vineyard, put under advantages) for not bringing forth grapes,<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> v. 1,&mdash;4.</NOTE> it is certain, that God's ordinary ap|pointed way of di&s;pen&s;ing &s;aving mercy to his covenant people, is that of their earne&s;t &s;eeking to him for it, in a diligent attendance on all ap|pointed means. Again,</P>
<P>(2) If means of grace are not appointed by God, to be earne&s;tly at|tended on as above, will it not thence clearly follow, that God in re|quiring of his covenant people faith in Chri&s;t, as the condition of life, requires of them what is naturally impo&s;&s;ible? Since without means, faith in Chri&s;t is &s;o. But &s;uch requirement can't agree to the perfections of God; therefore means of grace are appointed to be attended on as above</P>
<P>(3) This truth might be exemplified thro' the &s;criptures, were there occa&s;ion. Thus Ephraim per&s;onating the ten tribes (being in exile) in their return to God by repentance, is heard bemoaning him&s;elf, and crying to God for mercy. "I have &s;urely heard Ephraim bemoaning him&s;elf thus, thou ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed me, and I was cha&s;ti&s;ed, as a bullock unaccu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">omed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> thou me, and I &s;hall be turned."<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxi. 18.</NOTE> Where 'tis evident that while unconverted, he thus bemoans him&s;elf, confe&s;&s;ing the ju&s;tice of God's cha&s;ti&s;ement, his own &s;tubborne&s;s and unteachablene&s;s, and under conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of this change; his own impotency, and the in&s;ufficiency of all means; he cries to God to work it in him. Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned. And is represented as converted, while he &s;tands praying for it, as is incon|te&s;libly clear from the following words, "For thou art the Lord my God, &s;urely after I was turned, I repented, and after I was in&s;tructed, I &s;mote upon my thigh," and &s;o on.</P>
<P>The like might be abundantly proved concerning Judah brought to repentance in their return from the Babyloni&s;h captivity; which was brought about in the &s;ame way, by their being fir&s;t made &s;en&s;ible of their &s;inful, helple&s;s &s;tate; that as they had no power to deliver them|&s;elves from their captivity in Babylon; &s;o, much le&s;s had they power to deliver them&s;elves from their more mi&s;erable captivity to &s;in, pre|figured by their captivity in Babylon; their language with re&s;pect to both the&s;e was, our bones are dryed, and our hope is lo&s;t, we are cut off for our parts,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxvii. 11.</NOTE> until the Lord in both the&s;e re&s;pects, cau&s;ed a noi&s;e and behold a &s;haking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the &s;inews and fle&s;h came up upon them, and the &s;kin covered them above. Now as all this was done for them politically by common providence, and common influence, when king Cyrus's proclamation came out, and God &s;tirred up their hearts, there was a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> commotion, a running together from all parts; and great con&s;ulting and advi&s;ing no doubt about the affair, while as yet God had not in&s;pired them with that courage and re&s;o|lution that was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;o grand an undertaking, as that of a return to their own land. So there can be no rea&s;onable doubt, but that all this was done &s;piritually for them, previous to their receiv|ing the breath of &s;piritual life, and as means to &s;tir them up to &s;eek it in God's way, with great zeal and earne&s;tne&s;s, enquiring of him to do it for them, as in the text.</P>
<P>Again, as this truth is exemplified in God's dealing with the Jewi&s;h church, his covenant people, even the whole hou&s;e of I&s;rael under the law; &s;o it &s;tands in the &s;ame light, if we come down to the go&s;pel day. Thus the prodigal, who con&s;idered in his return to his father's hou&s;e, was de&s;igned as a type or figure of the ordinary way of &s;inners being brought &s;avingly home to Chri&s;t; he was fir&s;t made &s;en&s;ible of his peri&s;hing &s;tare; having &s;pent all, there aro&s;e a mighty famine in the land; all attempts to fill his belly with the hu&s;ks that the &s;wine did eat, utterly failed, no man gave unto him. He now began to be in want,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lu. xv. 14, 15, 16, and &s;o on.</NOTE> felt him&s;elf in a fami&s;hing condition, for want of bread; this put him in earne&s;t upon thinking what he had done; and at all hope of relief, that now remained was from his father; he earne&s;tly look'd out for help in this way, and found relief. All this is a lively repre&s;entation of the &s;inner's being brought to a feeling &s;en&s;e of his peri&s;hing want of the bread of life,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Job. vi. 51.</NOTE> and that God only has it in his power to be&s;tow; and therefore with great earne&s;tne&s;s to look to God for it, as one that &s;eeks bread when life is at &s;take, and that in this way, and not out of it, God's &s;aving mercy is ordinarily di&s;pen&s;ed.</P>
<P>Again, the same truth is exemplified in the compari&s;on made be|tween the publican and phari&s;ee, of whom 'tis &s;aid the phari&s;ee &s;tood and prayed thus with him&s;elf, God I thank thee that I am not as other men, &amp;c.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Lu. xviii. 13, 14.</NOTE> The publican &s;tanding afar off, would not &s;o much as lift up his eyes unto heaven, but &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, &s;aying, God be merciful to me a &s;inner. I tell you this man went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified <HI>rather</HI> than the other.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this parable, it &s;eems, is plainly to repre&s;ent the dif|ference there is between the proud, stupid, &s;elf righteous &s;inner, and one that is legally humbled, brought to conviction, that the &s;entence of condemnation he is under by the law, is ju&s;t, and accordingly to cry to God for mercy, as his only plea. Where the preference is plainly given to the latter, in compari&s;on of the former; I tell you, &s;ays Chri&s;t, this man went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified, <HI>rather</HI> than the former. The latter is plainly repre&s;ented in &s;tate, not &s;o far from the kingdom of God, as the former; the former as being the whole, that have no need of a phy&s;ician, the latter as &s;ick, and &s;en&s;ible of his peri&s;hing need. I am &s;en&s;ible &s;ome are of opinion, that the prayer of the pub|lican, was the prayer of a &s;aint; and that the compari&s;on here made by Chri&s;t, is de&s;igned to be a compari&s;on between the prayer of a &s;aint, and a &s;inner. In order to remove this mi&s;take, and es&s;tabli&s;h the true meaning of this parable, as above, I de&s;ire the following particu|lars may be noticed.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there does not appear any thing in the publican's prayer conclu&s;ive of his being a &s;aint; no di&s;tinguishing character of a &s;aint, nothing but what &s;trictly agrees to the prayer of a convinced, legally humbled &s;inner.</P>
<P N="2">2. It might be queried here, what the in&s;truction is, ari&s;ing from a compari&s;on, if made between the prayer of a &s;aint, and a proud, &s;tu|pid, &s;elf ju&s;tifying &s;inner, in &s;ome re&s;pects, if not on the whole, the vile&s;t of all &s;inners; that might agree to an infinite wi&s;dom, to hold forth to us, by &s;uch a &s;imilitude? Is it, that the prayer of a &s;aint put up in faith, is more acceptable to God, than the prayer of one of the vile&s;t &s;inners upon earth?</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it attended with no difficulty, to reconcile the deci&s;ion here given by Chri&s;t, on &s;uppo&s;ition the compari&s;on was made between the prayer of a &s;aint and a &s;inner, with his infinite perfections as God? Is this the whole truth? Does it agree with the &s;cripture account in general, of the difference between a &s;aint and a &s;inner; Is it not the character of a &s;aint to lift up his eyes with his heart to God in prayer, to draw near with full a&s;&s;urance of faith, and come boldly to a throne of grace?<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 19,&mdash;22.</NOTE> All which are directly the rever&s;e to the character here given to the poor dejected publican. But after all.</P>
<P N="4">4. Suppo&s;e there &s;hould be grounds in Chri&s;t's clo&s;ing words, to per&s;uade, that he went down to his hou&s;e truly ju&s;tified: Yet even then the manner of expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed, does not give us the lea&s;t intima|tion, that he came up from his hou&s;e ju&s;tified, but quite the rever&s;e, or that he prayed ju&s;tified; &s;o that, if this matter &s;hould be &s;o far conceeded, which is, I think, the mo&s;t that can rea&s;onably be de&s;ired, he is thereby but a more illu&s;trious in&s;tance, to my purpo&s;e, of one converted, while he &s;tood praying, or very &s;oon con&s;equent thereon, at lea&s;t in the way as he returned home.</P>
<P>To conclude, if it had been the de&s;ign of our Saviour, to give the true difference between the prayer of a &s;aint and a &s;inner: Is it not wonderful, there &s;hould be &s;o little of in&s;truction held forth in it? And not one di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of a &s;aint found in it? Can this agree to the infinite perfections of Chri&s;t, as God? Whereas the parable taken in the other &s;en&s;e above mentioned, is wonderfully &s;uited to repre&s;ent the difference between the prayer of a proud, &s;tupid, &s;elf-ju&s;tifying &s;inner, and a guilty humbled &s;elf-condemning &s;inner, ap|plying to the mercy of God as the only hope that remained: And does clearly explicate tho&s;e words of our Saviour, <HI>The whole have no need of the phy&s;ician, but the &s;ick.</HI> This proud, &s;tupid, &s;elf-ju&s;tifying phari&s;ee, is one that is whole, and needs no phy&s;ician, And in his pride and ignorance, thanks God for it. The publican is one, that is &s;ick, feels his guilt and moral di&s;order, as a de&s;perate and incureable di&s;ea&s;e, as to all created power, and therefore cries to God for help. Now if the whole and &s;ick mentioned by our Saviour, are rightly ex|plained by the phari&s;ee and publican, as above, and the words imme|diately following, viz. I came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance, have re&s;pect to the whole and &s;ick, under the names of righteous and &s;inners, as it is evident, I think, they have: Then it mu&s;t clearly follow, that Chri&s;t's errand as a phy&s;ician, for di&s;pen&s;ing his &s;aving grace, is not &s;o immediately, with the proud, &s;elf ju&s;tifying &s;inner, as with the humble, brought to &s;ee his peri&s;hing need of mer|cy, and earne&s;tly to &s;eek to God for it, in the u&s;e of all means.</P>
<P>Thus, if I mi&s;take not, this parable, of it &s;elf, if rightly under&s;tood, &s;ufficiently confirms the truth I am contending for, that God will be inquired of by the unregenerate, vi&s;ibly related to him in covenant, in the diligent u&s;e of all means, for the be&s;towment of his &s;aving mercy. And in the &s;ucce&s;s, or preference given to the humble and earne&s;t cries of the publican, compared with the proud phari&s;ee, we have a &s;hining evidence of it.</P>
<P>I might now, were there occa&s;ion, proceed to add the three thou|&s;and and others, that were fir&s;t made &s;en&s;ible of their &s;in and guilt, and brought in earne&s;t to cry out for direction, what they mu&s;t do, in order to a remedy previous to their receiving divine consolation. Nor do I &s;ee why the apo&s;tles evidence &s;hould not be allowed in his own ca&s;e, when he te&s;tifies he was &s;lain by the law, and thro' the law dead to the law, previous, and that he might live to God. I might &s;afely appeal to the experience of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and to the univer&s;al voice of the holy &s;criptures; which abundantly &s;hew that 'tis the &s;eeking &s;in|ner, that finds the pearl; the labouring and heavy laden, that finds re&s;t; the &s;ick and wounded that finds healing; the lo&s;t that are found; and the dead that are made alive, i. e. tho&s;e that are &s;en&s;ibly &s;o. But I pa&s;s to give a hint or two of the u&s;efulne&s;s and importance of this truth. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. In addition to the important purpo&s;es, it is made to &s;ub&s;erve, as mentioned above, another is its excellent u&s;e, to awaken the &s;ecure, who live in the carele&s;s neglect of means; and point out to them the imminent danger they are in, being wide and remote from the way, in which God's &s;aving mercy is wont to be di&s;pen&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. As it often &s;erves greatly to excite the &s;inner weary and heavy laden, to exert him&s;elf in the u&s;e of means, as being the only way of hope, or encouragement of finding mercy.</P>
<P N="3">3. As it mightily &s;upports again&s;t di&s;paring thoughts, when the &s;inner is tempted to give up all hope of ever attaining mercy, while he finds within, nothing but a fountain of &s;in, de&s;ert of puni&s;hment, and an accu&s;ing con&s;cience; without, a violated law, an incen&s;ed, &s;in-re|venging Deity, floods of impending wrath every moment ready to break upon him. What is it that &s;upports the &s;inner in this awful moment, but the truth under con&s;ideration, hope what a &s;overeign grace may do for him in this way, tho' not in the lea&s;t for his cries; yet it is evident it is in this way, as being God's way, and not out of is, not in the way of ca&s;ting off fear and re&s;training prayer before God, that he is &s;upported.</P>
<P>The way in which many, as I apprehend, have been led to mi&s;take the meaning of the&s;e words, is by under&s;tanding them as a conditional promi&s;e made by the Almighty to his covenant people, of the be&s;tow|ment of certain &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, if they &s;aught him in truth; like that of our &s;aviour, A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. 7.</NOTE> Whereas no|thing of this nature, to my under&s;tanding, is here intended. The words are &s;poken in the way of a prediction or prophecy; and &s;hewed them what God had ab&s;olutely, not conditionally, determined to ac|complish for his people. And may fitly be termed an ab&s;olute un|conditional promi&s;e, as is common in the &s;cripture. Two things are here ab&s;olutely promi&s;ed relating to the&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P N="1">1. That God would be&s;tow them, and the time when clearly point|ed out, viz. when he brought them into their own land, which he there promi&s;es; "Then will I &s;prinkle clean water upon you, and ye &s;hall be clean from all your filthine&s;s, and from all your idols will I clean&s;e you. A new heart al&s;o will I give you, and a new &s;pirit will I put within you, and I will take away the &s;tony heart out of your fle&s;h. And I will put my &s;pirit within you, and cau&s;e you to walk in my &s;tatutes," &amp;c.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">v. 25, 28.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. The way or means, by which this great work &s;hould be accom|pli&s;hed, is clearly pointed out and predicted, viz. their being brought to &s;eek it, enquire of God for it, as in the text. This God promi&s;es they &s;hall do. And hereby the grand objection, that lay again&s;t ac|compli&s;hing the be&s;towment of the&s;e great ble&s;&s;ings was taken up. The objection &s;tood thus, Lord thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed the accompli&s;hment of a great and marvellous work among thy people I&s;rael, to bring them to repentance, and clean&s;e them from all their idols. Which con&s;i|dering to what a de&s;perate &s;tate they are reduced, how they have ca&s;t away thy laws, neglected thy wor&s;hip and ordinances, are &s;wal|lowed up in idolatry: And that this has for a long time been their ca&s;e: By what po&s;&s;ible means can this wonderful work be accom|pli&s;hed in them, a work equal to that of their being brought up out of their graves? Shall it be in an extraordinary, miraculous way, &s;ince they utterly ca&s;t off all means? Nay, as if the Lord had expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid in the text, they &s;hall be brought to &s;eek me in a diligent atten|dance on my &s;tated wor&s;hip and ordinances. All which was exactly accompli&s;hed, on their return to their own land; when the altar of God was &s;et up, and they brought willingly to reform what was ami&s;s, and with great zeal and concern to attend on God's wor&s;hip and or|dinances, in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ezr. iii. Neh. viii.</NOTE></P>
<P>All this is without any intimation of a &s;u&s;pending condition to be performed by the people, as that, on which this wonderful work of God depended. No condition here, but what is abundantly promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Should it be enquired here, but mu&s;t the gracious prayers of &s;aints be excluded from being comprehended in the text, and the worthle&s;s prayers of the wicked I&s;raelites, about to be made the &s;ubjects of God's &s;pecial grace, &s;ub&s;tituted in their room?</P>
<P>An&s;. 1. Nither the prayers of the &s;aints, or of the unregenerate are nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;idered as proper conditions for the be&s;towment of the&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. Since, as hath been ob&s;erved, they are promi&s;ed ab&s;olutely and without conditions. Nor.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do I &s;ee, as &s;aints and &s;inners make up the whole hou&s;e of I&s;rael, why both may not here be under&s;tood, as brought to &s;eek the Lord together, on this grand occa&s;ion, in a diligent attendance on his wor&s;hip and ordinances.</P>
<P>Should it be objected here, that then very different things mu&s;t be under&s;tood, by that enquiring of God mentioned in the text. I an|&s;wer, and where is the incon&s;i&s;tency of this? Does not the go&s;pel reach all that are under the advantages of it, vi&s;ibly related to God, to deny ungodline&s;s, and worldly lu&s;ts, and live &s;oberly, &amp;c. And is not a gracious manner of refraining from ungodline&s;s, and practicing ju&s;tice, charity, &amp;c. Sometimes found with the godly, a very different thing from all that the unregenerate can do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and can any one &s;ay with truth, that the go&s;pel in no &s;en&s;e requires, what the unregenerate, related to God, as above, can do? Sure he cannot.</P>
<P>And now, &s;eeing the &s;en&s;e in which I under&s;tand the text, under con&s;ideration, is a divine truth, clearly held forth throughout the &s;criptures, a truth of no &s;mall importance, and &s;eeing it flows naturally from the words, without any the lea&s;t impropriety, or force put upon them, while putting the &s;en&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, attended with much difficulty. Can any rea&s;onable doubt remain, whether it be the true and genuine &s;en&s;e of the text? I appeal to the learned and judicious reader.</P>
<P>The only apology I &s;hall make, for dwelling &s;o largely on the &s;en&s;e of this text, is contained in the author's clo&s;ing words on the &s;ame text, viz. <Q>Becau&s;e it it &s;o &s;trangely mi&s;under&s;tood, not only by the doctor, but by many others.</Q></P>
<P>It will perhaps be expected, from the hints above, I &s;hould a little explain what I mean by new divinity; which I &s;hall do by reciting a pa&s;&s;age or two from the author referred to. <Q>What &s;o ever (&s;ays the author) I do, however a&s;&s;i&s;ted or prompted, is &s;till my own work, otherwi&s;e the mo&s;t common actions of life could not be called our own. Since in the&s;e we have a&s;&s;i&s;tance.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Letters to Theron and A&s;pacio, v. I. p. 33.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>I mention this pa&s;&s;age, not becau&s;e it is more erronious than many others; but becau&s;e, &s;o far as I di&s;cern, it was the author's fir&s;t turning a&s;ide from, and darkening the truth, in the letters referred to. It &s;eems it was on de&s;ign of laying the foundation of one of his fa|vourite principles, viz. that man is meerly pa&s;&s;ive in &s;aving faith. Two things in this pa&s;&s;age darken, or are incon&s;i&s;tent with truth.</P>
<P N="1">1. Terming an act of faith, or believing, comprehended under this phra&s;e, what &s;o ever I do a work, contrary to the u&s;age of &s;cripture, which ever keeps up a di&s;tinction between faith and works,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ro. xi. 6. iv. 16.</NOTE> and treats them as contraries that exclude each other in the bu&s;ine&s;s of ju&s;tifi|cation. And therefore to coa&s;ter them one into the other, and term one the other as the author here does, is to throw darkne&s;s and con|fu&s;ion upon the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="2">2. On &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;aving faith is comprehended, as it mu&s;t be in the author's words, as above; the argument is weak and inconclu&s;ive, as will be &s;een by every one that con&s;iders. That the point here to be proved by the author, is that &s;aving faith, if an act, if any thing done by us, is our own, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, as the mo&s;t common actions of life are. The argument to prove this, is, that it is performed by the &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that the mo&s;t common actions of life are. But it this true? Is it not evident to all, that the mo&s;t common actions of life are performed by the meer concurrence of common providence, &s;upporting our natural life and powers? And are we able thro' this meer concurrence of common providence, to <HI>believe</HI> unto &s;alvation? Sure nothing is further from truth.</P>
<P>Again, <Q>It is the &s;ame thing (&s;ays this author) whether we talk of obtaining righteou&s;ne&s;s by the law of Mo&s;es, by the light of nature or by Chri&s;t, if any &s;olicitude of ours be held needful to obtain it.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 27.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Here again, the author is really in the clouds. I appeal to the com|mon &s;en&s;e of mankind, what can be the meaning of this wonderful pa&s;&s;age? Is it that all the &s;olicitude, care and pains of &s;inners, can't produce faith in the blood of Chri&s;t that intere&s;ts in his righteou&s;ne&s;s? Is it, that there is nothing in all their attainments, that can claim it? Nothing that is holy, &s;piritual and plea&s;ing to God? No po&s;&s;itive mo|ral fitne&s;s, that can recommend to, or in the lea&s;t be a motive to the be&s;towment of it? If this is all, What hinder'd &s;o ingenious an author coming out of the clouds, and telling us plainly, in few words, that this was what he meant, that we might, &s;o far, be one with him?</P>
<P>But it &s;eems &s;omething more than all this it here meant. And what can that be, but that the &s;olicitude and concern of &s;inners to obtain righteou&s;ne&s;s by Chri&s;t, is in no &s;en&s;e to be held needful! Becau&s;e if it is, then to talk of obtaining righteou&s;ne&s;s by Chri&s;t, is the &s;ame thing as to talk of obtaining of it by the law of Mo&s;es or the light of nature.</P>
<P>Thus we are come at length to the true and genuine meaning of this wonderful pa&s;&s;age; the &s;en&s;e in which the words mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily terminate; and which, generally &s;peaking, is imbraced by all that fall in with this, new divinity, &s;o far as my acquaintance reaches. And hence, it &s;eems, it is, that &s;ome that are, or have been publick teachers, tell us, that God don't require any e&s;&s;ays, endeavours, or &s;olicitous concern of the unregenerate in the u&s;e of means, to repent and believe. He requires (&s;ay they) faith and repentance, but no e&s;&s;ays, endeavours, or &s;olicitous concern in the u&s;e of means to perform the&s;e duties. Does not a command to tho&s;e under the advantages of the go&s;pel, to &s;eek righteou&s;ne&s;s by Chri&s;t in the way of faith and repentance, imply in it a command to that attendance on means, to tho&s;e e&s;&s;ays, and to that &s;olicitous concern without which it is naturally impo&s;&s;ible? Sure if God commands men to believe &amp; repent, as the way of obtaining righteou&s;ne&s;s by Chri&s;t; 'tis not in a way naturally impo&s;&s;ible. But to command the&s;e du|ties, without any attendance to means, without any e&s;&s;ay, endeavour, or &s;olicitous concern to perform them; is to command them in a way na|turally impo&s;&s;ible. Am I under the advantages of the go&s;pel, com|manded to believe and repent, as the way to obtain righteou&s;ne&s;s by Chri&s;t, on pain of eternal damnation? And not thereby required to be &s;olicitous to believe and repent? What I required to do it, on pain of eternal damnation, and not thereby required in any &s;en&s;e to be con|cerned or &s;olicitous about it? Strange! Is not this &s;trange divinity, and as &s;trange rea&s;oning? And yet this is evidently the true and ge|nuine &s;en&s;e of the author, as may be further &s;een in what follows. The author having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hundred pages in profound &s;ilence, as to any the lea&s;t intimation of any thing, &s;o far as I remember, to be done by the unregenerate, as means in order to obtain faith, at length puts the que&s;tion, with the an&s;wer in the following words, viz.</P>
<P>"Que&s;. How is faith to be obtained?"</P>
<P><Q>An&s;. How have the mo&s;t remarkable di&s;coveries, that have &s;er|ved mo&s;t for the accomodation of human life been obtained? Did not the polar direction of the Magnet obtrude it&s;elf on the fir&s;t dis|coverer when he was in que&s;t of no &s;uch thing, &amp;c. &amp;c.<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">v. ii. p. 133.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages terminate very much in the &s;ame thing. The for|mer holds forth, that there is no need of any &s;olicitous concern of the &s;inners, to obtain righteou&s;ne&s;s by Chri&s;t: That to hold any &s;uch con|cern needful, makes obtaining righteou&s;ne&s;s by Chri&s;t, as impo&s;&s;ible as obtaining of it by the law of Mo&s;es, or any other impo&s;&s;ible way: The latter teaches, that the way to obtain faith, is not to be in que&s;t of it at all, i.e. not to &s;eek it, or care any thing about it; that if ever we obtain it, it will obtrude it&s;elf upon us, in &s;ome carele&s;s mo|ment, when we have no thought or concern about it, The &s;pirit speaketh expre&s;sly, that in the latter times, &s;ome &s;hall depart from the faith, giving heed to &s;educing &s;pirits and doctrines of devils.<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Tim iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, tho' I wou'd be far from giving &s;evere and har&s;h epithets; yet &s;o far, I think, we may &s;afely determin in the fear of God, that if this carele&s;s, thoughtle&s;s unconcernedne&s;s to obtain faith, is that &s;eeking of it required of &s;inners; the devil and the corruption of mens hearts, in the&s;e degenerate times, &s;ufficiently prompts them to it, without its be|ing preach'd. So that the work of preachers, who are of this opinion, is almo&s;t every where already awfully done to their hand.</P>
<P>Obj 1. Should it be objected here, that all this is de&s;igned only to bring &s;inners thoroughly off from their own righteou&s;ne&s;s; Which &s;o far as it prevails, is a fatal bar in the way of their coming to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>An&s;. To bring &s;inners off from their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, is an im|portant work. Thou&s;ands, it is to be fear'd, have peri&s;hed by that &s;nare: But then it mu&s;t be attempted in and not out of God's way, by truth and not by fal&s;hood, we mu&s;t not be wi&s;e above what is written: While we attempt to &s;care men from tru&s;ting in their duties, care mu&s;t he had, that we don't &s;care them from their duties, either by in&s;inu|ating, that they are more vile in that attendance they are capable of, while unregenerate, than in the neglect of it; or by denying that the ordinary appointed way of God's di&s;pen&s;ing his &s;aving mercy to his covenant people, is that of his being inquired of by them, in a diligent attendance on all means, to be&s;tow it on them, as above,</P>
<P>Obj. 2. But if after all, it &s;hould be objected here, that by the un|regenerate's being in que&s;t of faith, and &s;olicitous to obtain righteou&s;|ne&s;s by Chri&s;t, is meant their being &s;o in &s;trict propriety of &s;peech, de&s;irous of the&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings for them&s;elves, and from the delight they have in them. That as this never was or can be the ca&s;e with the unregenerate: So in this way righteou&s;ne&s;s by Chri&s;t can no more be obtained than by the law of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>An&s;. If this was truly the author's meaning, it ought to have been &s;o expre&s;s. And then who would have troubled them&s;elves about it? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as it is expre&s;t in general, left at large, and naturally liable to be under&s;tood to exclude all &s;olicitude to obtain righteou&s;ne&s;s by Chri&s;t, and of being in que&s;t of faith in any &s;en&s;e, it is not true, tends to con|fu&s;ion, and is therefore ju&s;tly liable to exception.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this matter by a plain &s;imile. Suppo&s;e for in&s;tance, A. is &s;truck with mortification in his foot, and under apprehen&s;ion of im|minent danger is to life; is earne&s;tly de&s;irous of amputation; &s;ends far and wide for a &s;kilful &s;urgeon, to perform the operation. B. takes it in his head to report equally far and wide, that A. is utterly aver&s;e to the operation, that all &s;how of being in que&s;t of it, and &s;olicitous to obtain it, was a meer pretence, that had no truth in it. However, on the arrival of the &s;urgeon, A. chearfully &s;ubmits to the operation, and is recovered. In the mean time, contradictions ri&s;e &s;o high among the people relating to this matter, &s;ome affirming, and others denying, that B. is accu&s;ed of &s;preading a fal&s;e report: Pleads he only meant, that A. did not de&s;ire the operation of the knife and &s;aw for it &s;elf; and &s;o did not properly and directly de&s;ire it. That he knew as well as any one, that on the whole, A. was earne&s;tly in que&s;t of it, and very &s;olicitous to obtaain it. What would the common &s;en&s;e of mankind &s;ay of B.? Wou'd it not &s;ay, he was rather too fond of his metaphy|&s;icks, to &s;et all the world a &s;taring for a thing of nought? For who ever once imagined, that A. was de&s;irous of the operation for its own &s;ake? Or at the &s;ame time doubted whether he was, on the whole, earne&s;tly de&s;irous of it, and &s;olicitous to obtain it, con&s;ider'd in con|nexion with the hope he thereby entertained of &s;aving his precious life.</P>
<P>In like manner, &s;inners. tho' they de&s;ire not Chri&s;t for him&s;elf, his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;alvation, for that holine&s;s in which it greatly con|&s;i&s;ts: Yet when they come to &s;ee their peri&s;hing &s;tate, under the guilt of &s;in, that nothing &s;hort of an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;ne&s;s by faith, can &s;ave them from everla&s;ting burning, it can't be &s;aid with truth, that they do in no &s;en&s;e de&s;ire Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor do I &s;ee it po&s;&s;ible to reconcile this new &s;entiment, with the expre&s;s declarations of God's word, as quoted above, and other texts that might be mentioned. Thus when our Saviour a&s;&s;ures us, that many will &s;eek to enter, i. e. at the &s;trait gate, and &s;hall not be able. Are not the&s;e words evidently &s;poken of the unregenerate? And do they in no &s;en&s;e repre&s;ent &s;o much as &s;aint attempts of &s;uch to believe on Chri&s;t, and thereby enter upon the chri&s;tian life, a life of go&s;pel holine&s;s. Which &s;ure mu&s;t be the meaning of entering in at the &s;trait gate, in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words, to which we are here exhorted, what ever &s;econdary reference they may have to entering into heaven after death.</P>
<P>So when it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, that E&s;au &s;aught repentance carefully, and with tears. Is there no attempts of E&s;au towards repentance in any &s;en&s;e, repre&s;ented by the&s;e words? No kind of de&s;ires or endeavours after it? When 'tis expre&s;sly &s;aid, he &s;aught it carefully, and with tears. What! not &s;o much as from &s;elf-love? When the above quoted au|thor ob&s;erves, <Q>that &s;elf love does not only in innumerable re&s;pects, re&s;train from acts of true wickedne&s;s,&mdash;but puts men upon &s;eeking <HI>true</HI> virtue.<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;. Edwards on the nature of true vertue, Ch. vii. p. 133.</NOTE></Q> Wou'd it not be expre&s;sly to deny the truth of the holy &s;criptures, to deny that E&s;au in any &s;en&s;e &s;aught repentance?</P>
<P>The like inquiry may be made on tho&s;e words of &s;aint Paul, Know ye not, that they which run in a race, run all, but one receiveth the prize?

faith, as above, is that in their opinion, this has a direct tendency to build per&s;ons up in their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and therefore carefully to be avoided. For an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is readily conceded there is great danger, when per&s;ons are brought to external &s;trictne&s;s of moral life, and attendance on means, left they re&s;t there, &s;hort of faith: However, the following particulars offer them|&s;elves, to be duly con&s;idered in this ca&s;e, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Whether the fir&s;t and great danger, tho&s;e that enjoy the go&s;pel are in, is not of irreligion and profane|ne&s;s, at lea&s;t a carele&s;s di&s;regard of religion? Is not this what we have rea&s;on to fear there is mo&s;t danger of where the go&s;pel comes; especially in a time of &s;o great and general corruption, as that of the pre&s;ent day? And is not profanene&s;s, at lea&s;t as fatal to the &s;ouls of men, as &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s? And by far more injurious to others, through the influence of bad examples?</P>
<P N="2">2ly. A di&s;tinction mu&s;t be kept up, between the na|tural tendency of means, and the abu&s;e of them. To
<PB N="91" REF="010691_0101_0F81E31FACE4DBE0">
&s;uppo&s;e the means of grace have a natural tendency to build per&s;ons up in their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, would be a reflection on the perfections of God, the wi&s;e author and in&s;titutor of means, not to be allowed. So that if there be danger in the ca&s;e, it ari&s;eth not from any natural tendency in means, or a due u&s;e of them, but from the abu&s;e of them, through the reigning power of corrupti|on in mens hearts. And therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3ly. All proper methods being u&s;ed again&s;t this dan|ger, duty mu&s;t be urged and pre&s;&s;ed home; whatever be the danger ari&s;ing from mens corruptions. This can be no exemption from duty: Duty mu&s;t be done, at all adventures. Be&s;ides, there is no certain connexion be|tween a painful attendance on means, and the reigning power of a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit. Thou&s;ands have prac|ti&s;ed the&s;e duties, who, by the grace of God, have e&s;cap|ed the fatal &s;nare of continuing under the power of a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="4">4ly. I would here propo&s;e, as a matter of &s;erious in|quiry, whether that pre&s;&s;ing after faith and holine&s;s, in the u&s;e of means, as above, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, is not the very way and means, which God ordinarily makes u&s;e of to bring &s;inners off from their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, by bringing them to an experimental conviction, of the peri&s;hing, helple&s;s &s;tate they are in, and thereby to die to all hope of righteou&s;ne&s;s by the law? How are &s;in|ners under a preparitory work of the law, brought to die to it, &s;o far forth, as dying to the law agrees to an unregenerate &s;tate, viz. to all hopes of righteou&s;ne&s;s by it? Is it not in a diligent &s;tudy of the holy &s;criptures, and of the divine law therein contained, with painful endeavours after conformity, that they are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the common influence of the &s;pirit, to apprehend that purity, &s;trictne&s;s and &s;pirituality of the law, called the coming
<PB N="92" REF="010691_0102_0F81E32183C0D0C0">
of the commandment? Whereby &s;in is &s;aid to revive i. e. by that light of the purity and &s;pirituality of the law &s;hining in the con&s;cience, &s;inners are enabled clearly to di&s;cover that to be &s;in, in many in&s;tances, which they &s;aw not before; and that hainou&s;ne&s;s in &s;in, and utter depravity of nature in them&s;elves, which they &s;aw not before, and by which they are fully convinced, that in them dwells no good thing, no principle of goodne&s;s, that can in any mea&s;ure an&s;wer to that perfection of holi|ne&s;s, which they now fee, the law requires. And hence righteou&s;ne&s;s by the law, becomes to them, &s;trictly im|po&s;&s;ible, and all hopes of it die. This is the account &s;aint Paul gives us, of the way in which he was brought off from his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, when the commandment came, &s;in revived and I died.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now if painful endeavours in the u&s;e of means, the &s;tudy of the law, and pre&s;&s;ing after holine&s;s, is the way in which &s;inners are wont, by the grace of God, to be brought off from their own righteou&s;ne&s;s; what colour is there for this objection?&mdash;Shall the abu&s;e of means to &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, which, thro' the &s;ubtility of &s;atan, and the corruption of mens hearts, God does &s;ometimes per|mit, be made an objection again&s;t the tight: u&s;e of means? God forbid.</P>
<P>Obj. V. 'Tis objected by &s;ome, that urging &s;inner's to pre&s;s after faith in a diligent attendance on means, as above, is very dangerous, lea&s;t in the mean time they die without faith, and peri&s;h eternally.</P>
<P>For an&s;wer here, I &s;hall only propo&s;e two queries.</P>
<P N="1">1. Is it not equally certain, the &s;inner will peri&s;h eter|nally, if he dies without faith, in the carele&s;s neglect of means?</P>
<P N="2">2. Is not the hazard and danger of dying without faith, at lea&s;t as great to tho&s;e that live in the carele&s;s
<PB N="93" REF="010691_0103_0F81E322442ADD30">
neglect of pre&s;&s;ing after it in the u&s;e of means, as to them that diligently attend on means to that end?</P>
<P>Obj. VI. That urging on the unregenerate, as in|di&s;pen&s;ible duty, a painful attendance on means in order to faith, as above, &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with the ab&s;olute &s;overeignty of God in di&s;pen&s;ing &s;aving grace to &s;inners.</P>
<P>An&s;. Since the utmo&s;t attainments the unregenerate are capable of in the u&s;e of means, have nothing in them holy, &s;piritual, or plea&s;ing to God, nothing that can in|title or recommend them to his favour, there can be no real incon&s;i&s;tency between the&s;e attainments of the un|regenerate, and the be&s;towment of every grace, in the way of ab&s;olute &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>Obj. VII. The grand objection with &s;ome, chiefly tho&s;e inclined to favour the new divinity,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters to Theron and A&s;pa&s;io, v<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">i. p. 33.</NOTE> again&s;t urg|ing a diligent attendance on prayer and other duties, on the unregenerate, as a means in order to obtain God's &s;aving mercy, as above, is, that all their performances are &s;in, and that therefore, it can't agree to the purity of God's nature to require them.</P>
<P>Here, as it is common, in the &s;pread of error, there is a variety of &s;entiments; &s;ome who are, or have been publick teachers, have peremptorily denied, that the un|regenerate are required to pray. Others teach that 'tis their duty to pray, with this provi&s;o, viz. that they pray in faith. Others again, that 'tis their duty to &s;eek grace in a go&s;pel way, evidently meaning, when they explain them&s;elves, the &s;ame thing as above.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to a more immediate an&s;wer to this objection, I a&s;k leave to query, whether putting the un|regenerate upon praying for faith and regenerating grace, on condition they pray in faith, does not imply in it a plain incon&s;i&s;tency? And whether it be not the &s;ame
<PB N="94" REF="010691_0104_0F81E322E49061D0">
with teaching them not to pray, 'till they have faith? Be&s;ides, what have the unregenerate, while &s;uch, to ground an act of faith in prayer upon? Since as the au|thor hath well proved, they have no title to any of the promi&s;es.</P>
<P>But to proceed in order to a more direct an&s;wer, I shall,</P>
<P N="1">1. Attempt to remove a mi&s;take, on which the objec|tion &s;eems, at lea&s;t in part, founded, and take notice of &s;ome texts principally urged in its favour.</P>
<P N="2">2. Offer &s;ome further hints in confirmation of the main point objected again&s;t, viz. that the unregenerate are required to pray, and attend on other religious duties.</P>
<P N="1">1. The mi&s;take on which this objection is founded, is a &s;uppo&s;ition, that there is a natural connexion between requiring the unregenerate to pray, and requiring them to &s;in: Whereas the connexion is intirely of a moral nature, and ari&s;es meerly from a moral cau&s;e, the crea|ture's want of moral ability, or which is the &s;ame, his want of di&s;po&s;ition of heart, and inclination of will &s;in|cerely to comply with the command, which is meerly the creatures fault. And &s;hall this fault of the creature be attributed to God's command, requiring what is &s;trictly the creatures duty?</P>
<P>To make this mi&s;take plain to the meane&s;t capacity, &s;uppo&s;e a father correcting his &s;on for di&s;obedient, rebel|lous behaviour, &s;hould in the clo&s;e, require him to bow his head, in token of reverence, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his parental authority: The &s;on thro' un&s;ubdued perver&s;e|ne&s;s of temper, bows in hypocri&s;y. Does the father by commanding the duty, command the &s;in? Far be it. And much le&s;s in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus removing the mi&s;take the objection is built up|on, it vani&s;hes; and God's requiring the unregenerate to pray and attend on other means of grace, is at an infi|nite
<PB N="95" REF="010691_0105_0F81E3235CF4E338">
remove from commanding the &s;in, either of their neglect, or wrong manner of performance.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I &s;ee not on this principle, how the Almighty can be free from commanding &s;in, in commanding duty of the &s;aints: Since they never did, or can perform a duty, but what is attended with &s;in: And &s;ince their prayers are often performed without the exerci&s;e of grace; and &s;o are at lea&s;t as &s;inful, as the prayers of the unregenerate. And therefore if requiring duty in the one ca&s;e, be requiring &s;in, why not in the other? And &s;ure it mu&s;t be equally incon&s;i&s;tent with the purity of God's nature, to require &s;in in every in&s;tance, I might here con&s;ider, and reply to all tho&s;e texts improved to enforce this objection; but &s;hall for the pre&s;ent mention only one or two, that are mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on, viz. Bring no more vain oblations, incen&s;e is an abomination, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. i. 13.</NOTE> This &s;ome have mi&s;taken for a plain prohibition to the unregenerate, while &s;uch, to pray. This notion ap|pears too gro&s;s to need an an&s;wer. Since for the &s;ame rea&s;on, if admitted, it will follow, that the unregenerate, while &s;uch, are not required to attend any other duty.</P>
<P>However, one manife&s;t mi&s;take this objection labours under, is a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the &s;ame degree of gro&s;s hy|pocri&s;y and heinous wickedne&s;s attending the religious performances of tho&s;e mentioned in the text, are found attending the prayers and religious exerci&s;es of all the unregenerate under the go&s;pel. All mu&s;t be equally wicked, with tho&s;e murderers in the text, who&s;e hands were full of blood, who had reach'd to that unutterable height of wickedne&s;s, whereby they are &s;aid to have out-done their &s;i&s;ter Sodom,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ez. xvi. 47, 48.</NOTE> not only come up with, but exceed|ed in wickedne&s;s, even the men of Sodom, who were &s;inners before the Lord exceedingly.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ge. xiii. 13.</NOTE> This equality of

heinou&s;ne&s;s attending the prayers and other religious exerci&s;es of all the unregenerate under the go&s;pel, to what ever degree they are brought to reverence their con&s;ciences, and reform their lives, mu&s;t univer&s;ally keep pace with that of tho&s;e in the text; otherwi&s;e the ar|gument fails. Nor is it to the purpo&s;e here to &s;ay, the prayers of all the unregenerate are abominable in God's &s;ight; Since 'tis equality of heinou&s;ne&s;s that mu&s;t be made good, in this ca&s;e, in order to argue the point in hand conclu&s;ively, from this text. Which being impo&s;|&s;ible, becau&s;e not true, the objection &s;o far as &s;upported from this text, mu&s;t &s;ink.</P>
<P>Some other texts alledged for the &s;upport of this ob|jection, I &s;hall take notice of toward the clo&s;e, and there|fore pa&s;s for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd thing propo&s;ed under this objection, was to offer &s;ome further considerations, &s;hewing that the un|regenerate are required to pray, and attend other religi|ous duties, as means in order to obtain God's &s;aving mercy.</P>
<P>Where, by the way, the reader is refer'd to much that hath been already &s;aid to this purpo&s;e; as from the di|vine appointment of means to the end above; the ex|pre&s;s command to Simon, being unregenerate, to pray; encouragement to the prayer of a &s;inner &s;et before him; and largely on that text, Yet will I be enquired of, &amp;c. with many other particular texts, both in the old te&s;|tament and the new, pointing out a difference between the earne&s;t cries of a humble &s;inner, &s;en&s;ible of his pe|ri&s;hing need; and the carele&s;s remi&s;s reque&s;t of a proud, &s;tupid, &s;elf-ju&s;tifying &s;inner, giving a &s;ort of preference to the former, at lea&s;t, as being le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and more in the way, in which God's &s;overeign mercy is wont to be di&s;played.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="010691_0107_0F81E324DF1DD9D0">Here to prevent mi&s;takes and objections that might ari&s;e, let it be noted, that in what hath been or may further be &s;aid, of the unregenerate's being required to pray, &amp;c. I would be understood to mean, &s;uch of the unregenerate, as are vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant, at lea&s;t admitted by bapti&s;m, and thereby being trained up under the advantages of the go&s;pel, laid under &s;olemn vows to deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and live &s;o|berly, righteou&s;ly, and godly. The&s;e, all the&s;e, whether regenerate or unregenerate, are required to pray and at|tend other religious and chri&s;tian duties, as above.</P>
<P>Here I take it for granted, we &s;hall have the univer&s;al con&s;ent of all parties to the truth of what is here laid down, the&s;e words being added, viz. in a go&s;pel &s;en&s;e, or gra|cious manner. And then they run thus, viz. All who are vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant, and favoured with the advantages of the go&s;pel, whether regenerate or un|regenerate, are required in a gracious manner to pray, deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here then we are happily agreed. But the great dif|ficulty &s;till remaining, is to make it appear, that all, both regenerate and unregenerate, &s;tanding in this vi&s;ible re|lation to God, are required to pray, &amp;c. tho' they fail and come &s;hort of a gracious manner. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the regenerate, the children of God; is it not certain they are required to pray, and attend on all other chri&s;tian duties, tho' they fail of a gracious man|ner? Be it &s;o, that they are required to perform them in a gracious manner: Yet &s;ure 'tis not conditionally, that they are required, if performed in a gracious man|ner; but ab&s;olutely, tho' they fail of a gracious manner. If they fail in their endeavours after a gracious manner, and reach only to a con&s;cientious performance; God
<PB N="98" REF="010691_0108_0F81E32597AC8FE8">
requires that, as being at a le&s;s remove from the obedi|ence required, than a total omi&s;&s;ion would be. Thus as to all duties of piety, ju&s;tice, charity, and even the whole body of chri&s;tian duties, all that the go&s;pel teaches, good men are in &s;ome &s;en&s;e required to practi&s;e, tho' they fail in their endeavours after a gracious manner.</P>
<P>The truth in hand is indeed too plain to need being in&s;i&s;ted on; as all good men, &s;o far as they are &s;uch, practically own it, and con&s;tantly give in their te&s;timonies to the truth of it, by making con&s;cience of performing all the&s;e duties, tho' they fail in their endeavours after a gracious manner.</P>
<P>'Tis obvious and plain, that every command requiring obedience, requires every thing that hath, tho' but a re|mote tendency thereto; and forbids every thing that hath tho' but a remote tendency to the contrary. But thus con&s;cientiou&s;ly performing prayer &s;urely has at lea&s;t a remote tendency, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And indeed how can this principle agree to that con|&s;i&s;tency and progre&s;s required in the chri&s;tian life, when ju&s;tice, alms deeds, or &s;ome other chri&s;tian duty is con|&s;tantly calling for di&s;patch? Or how can the publick teach|er know when the &s;ea&s;on of wor&s;hip is come, whether it be &s;afe for him to enter the de&s;k? Since if he fails of a gracious manner in the work of the day, whatever his preparations, and however painful and con&s;ciencious in the performance, it had better been let alone, &s;ince what he has done was in no &s;en&s;e required, and &s;o is at be&s;t but a piece of unprofitable will-wor&s;hip. It is true, God don't require the&s;e things, becau&s;e they have in them any po&s;&s;itive vertue, or true moral goodne&s;s, whereby they are plea&s;ing and acceptable to him, or any &s;e|curity of &s;alvation to tho&s;e that perform them: but be|cau&s;e of a negative moral goodne&s;s, they have in them, i. e.
<PB N="99" REF="010691_0109_0F81E3266BD23B30">
the ab&s;ence of a greater degree of true moral evil, than there would be in the carele&s;s neglect of them, and other wi&s;e, and holy purpo&s;es, &s;uch as the promoting of God's vi&s;ible honour and glory in the world; the u&s;efulne&s;s of their charity and good examples to others, that &s;ee not their want of gracious &s;incerity; and by this means, being obliged can&s;tantly to practi&s;e all chri&s;tian duties in a gracious manner, and tho' they fall &s;hort of a gra|cious manner, they are con&s;tantly conver&s;ing with the grounds and rea&s;ons and motives to a holy life, and &s;o are put under the utmo&s;t advantages for growth and progre&s;s in holine&s;s: Moreover, all their deficiences and coming &s;hort of a gracious manner, which God knows is too, too frequent, is wont to be improved to promote their humility, teach them their own weakne&s;s and in&s;uf|ficiency to any thing that is holy and &s;piritual, and the obligations of gratitude they are under to God, for the mea&s;ure of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at any time granted them.</P>
<P>And now, as it is evident from the&s;e brief hints, that the regenerate, vi&s;ibly related to God, as above, are re|quired to pray, and attend other chri&s;tian duties, tho' they fall &s;hort of a gracious manner; becau&s;e the &s;erious con&s;cientious performance of them, is not at &s;o great a remove from the obedience required, as the contemptuous neglect of them would be: So for the &s;ame rea&s;on, it is equally evident, that the unregenerate, related to God, as above, are equally required to pray, and attend other chri&s;tian duties, tho' they fail of a gracious manner, and only con&s;cientiou&s;ly perform them. The duty com|manded being the &s;ame in both, and the rea&s;on the &s;ame, it hence follows, I think, that the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be the &s;ame as to both. Would it not be a thing quite unac|countable, once to imagine, that the regenerate, for whom God has done much more than for the unrege|nerate
<PB N="100" REF="010691_0110_0F81E327288CFF28">
are required to pray, &amp;c. tho' they fall &s;hort of the exerci&s;e of faith in prayer; but the unregenerate for whom God has done much le&s;s, not required to pray at all, unle&s;s in faith, nothing wavering. Alike unaccountable is this tho't as to the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice, charity, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Moreover, what further &s;erves to confirm the truth in hand, is that the &s;ame or like holy and important pur|po&s;es, are &s;erved in this, as in the former ca&s;e, a like ab|&s;ence of greater degrees of moral evil in a con&s;cientious performance, than in the contemptuous neglect; God's vi&s;ible honour and glory is in like manner promoted, the charity and good examples of the unregenerate alike u&s;eful to others. And whereas the godly by the con|&s;tant practice of all chri&s;tian duties, as above, at lea&s;t a con&s;cientious endeavour, are put under utmo&s;t advan|tage for growth and progre&s;s in the chri&s;tian life: So the unregenerate by being required to live in the con&s;tant practice of all chri&s;tian duties, and diligent attendance on all means, are fixed as it were in the mid&s;t of the bowels of all means of grace, all light of divine in&s;truc|tion, all motives and arguments, joyful and dreadful, &s;uit|ed by an infinite wi&s;dom, to per&s;uade to faith, and active conver&s;ion to God: And whereas the deficiencies attend|ing the performances of the regenerate, when they fall &s;hort of a gracious manner, are went to be made emi|nently &s;erviceable to promote their humility, and quicken to greater diligences: So in the unregenerate, the very means God is wont to make u&s;e of to humble and pre|pare for &s;aving mercy, is the great impurity and &s;inful|ne&s;s attending the &s;inners be&s;t duties, after his utmo&s;t efforts; whereby he is at length, by the common influ|ence of the &s;pirit, fully convinced, that &s;uch is the de&s;|perate depravity of his nature, that he can never come up with the infinite purity of God's law; and therefore

cries out in earne&s;t with the publican, God be merciful to me a &s;inner.</P>
<P>Thus we here &s;ee clearly, if I mi&s;take not, that God re|quires all, both regenerate and unregenerate, related to him, as above, to pray and attend other religious duties, &s;uch as ju&s;tice, charity, temperance, cha&s;tity, &amp;c. not conditionally, if performed in a gracious manner; but tho' they fail of a gracious manner, and only perform them con&s;cientiou&s;ly; with the rea&s;on of the require|ment of the&s;e performances, not becau&s;e they are holy; but becau&s;e le&s;s unholy. There is a le&s;s degree of true moral evil in the con&s;cientious performance of them, than in the contemptuous neglect of them, and therefore they are required. As reverence and obedience, to the voice and dictates of natural con&s;cience on meer princi|ples of nature; the exerci&s;e of natural pity to the mi&s;er|able; natural gratitude, for benefits received; natural affections in parents to children, &amp;c. The&s;e things we are &s;ure have nothing in them, that is holy and &s;piritual; and yet &s;ure we are, that God requires them. Other|wi&s;e the ab&s;ence of them, where higher principles are wanting, would be no &s;in; no &s;in to be without natural pity to the mi&s;erable; no &s;in in parents to be without natural affection to children. Becau&s;e where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. But we are &s;ure from the light of nature and &s;cripture, that the ab&s;ence of the&s;e things is great and heinous wickedne&s;s; therefore we are &s;ure God requires them, and ju&s;t thus it is with the du|ties above mentioned, required of the unregenerate. They are not required to God's gracious acceptance, but to other wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es worthy of God, &s;uch as the advancement of his declarative glory in the world, and the good of his vi&s;ible covenant people.</P>
<P>All I &s;hall add is a few hints, as to the ri&s;e of this &s;ad

<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Not to in&s;i&s;t on the depravity and corruption of human nature, which no doubt is in general, in &s;ome &s;ort, the &s;ource of all error; it appears to me, there is in this matter much of the &s;ubtilly of the grand adver&s;ary, transforming him&s;elf into an angel of light, if po&s;&s;ible to bring the precious means of grace into contempt; well knowing that if this point can be gained, fully gained; his intere&s;t and kingdom, is as well &s;ecured in the chri&s;|tian as in the heathen world.</P>
<P>The method he takes to accompli&s;h this his mi&s;chie|vous de&s;ign, &s;o far as does appear under colour of being on the &s;ide of truth, he exalts the infinite holine&s;s and purity of God's nature; depre&s;&s;es the fallen creature, as unutterably vile. In the mean time &s;ubtilly &s;ugge&s;ts, that the degree of the creature's &s;infulne&s;s of nature, com|pared with God's infinite purity, is &s;uch, that he is utterly unable, by his utmo&s;t endeavours after amendment of life, and diligent attendance on means, to do any thing, that God in any &s;en&s;e requires, or that hath &s;o much as a remote tendency to promote his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>This, as is well known, is the awful length, that &s;ome that are, or have been publick teachers, have gone. I am the more grieved, becau&s;e it is clear to me, that this is the grand de&s;ign the adver&s;ary, with all the forces he can mu&s;ter is driving at; that he may equally reign tri|umphant over the chri&s;tian, as he does over the heathen world. For if this dreadful conclu&s;ion once pa&s;s for truth, what are the precious means of grace good for? Or who will in earne&s;t prize, or improve them? This view of things may make a thou&s;and dei&s;ts and pro&s;ane profligates under the go&s;pel, but &s;ure, has not the remote&s;t tendency ever to make one true and real chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="010691_0113_0F81E32A20BBB708">That wherein the &s;ubtilty of the adver&s;ary, if po&s;&s;ible, is &s;till more evident, is, that all this is carried on with a high pretence and confidence, of clear light, and more eminent attainments in holine&s;s, that they are &s;eperating from truly antichri&s;tian mini&s;ters and churches; going over to a more pure wor&s;hip, and communion with the very &s;mall number of God's faithful ones. A firm but fal&s;e confidence, that every one that comes over to them, comes off from antichri&s;t, and joins with the only true church of Chri&s;t upon earth, has a mighty con&s;training force, to bring people over, and hold them fa&s;t; when once they catch this confidence, what the adver&s;ary never fails to bait his hook with when about to decoy good men, and bring ruin on the dear churches of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>That the&s;e are the views and &s;entiments with which tho&s;e proceed, whom I here oppo&s;e; is abundantly evi|dent: for tho' &s;ome of them are on the re&s;erve, being in doubt, whether it would be for the advantages of the cau&s;e to &s;peak the&s;e things out to a carnal, antichri&s;tian world: Yet others, more than a &s;ufficient number for witne&s;&s;es &s;peak out freely.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another ground of this mi&s;take, as it appears to me, is too great a fondne&s;s for, and dependance upon conclu&s;ions come into, as the re&s;ult of &s;ubtile metaphy&s;i|cal rea&s;oning, as tho' they were certain, and might be depended on; while nothing is more common than mi&s;takes in the&s;e ca&s;es, with a neglect of due attention to the plain natural meaning of the holy &s;criptures in this point; according to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind in like ca&s;es.</P>
<P>For illu&s;tration, &s;uppo&s;e a ma&s;ter has a large number of &s;ervants on his plantation; whom he is wont to vi&s;it once a year, and give them a word of exhortation, mind|ing them of his good u&s;age of them; and of their obli|gation.
<PB N="104" REF="010691_0114_0F81E32ADA7521E0">
Among other things, he requires them to be faithful to his intere&s;t, and do all his bu&s;ine&s;s with good will to him, and out of reverence to his authority as their ma&s;ter, as they ought.</P>
<P>Wou'd it not be &s;trange to common &s;en&s;e, if a num|ber of the&s;e &s;ervants, by their &s;ubtile rea&s;onings, &s;hould infer, that if they had not good will to their ma&s;ter, he did not require their &s;ervice? They own their obligations to have good will to him, and with good will to attend on his work: But no obligations from fear, or any other principle, to attend their ma&s;ter's work, if good will be wanting. And therefore they wholly neglect their ma&s;|ter's work; when great and valuable ends would be &s;e|cured to the ma&s;ter, meerly by the work done. For in|&s;tance, the barly, wheat, and flax which was lo&s;t, might have been &s;aved. So God hath great and valuable ends to &s;erve, as &s;een above, by a &s;trict and con&s;cientious obedience of his covenant people, tho' they fail of a gracious man|ner. What would common &s;en&s;e &s;ay of this conduct of the&s;e &s;ervants? Would it not pronounce it madne&s;s?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, &s;uppo&s;e the over&s;eer, imployed by the ma&s;ter, to &s;ee that the &s;ervants kept to their bu&s;ine&s;s, with whom the ma&s;ter's orders were lodged; &s;hould on being ap|plied to by the &s;ervants, countenance their notion, a&s;|&s;uring them, that on the mo&s;t diligent peru&s;al of his or|ders, he did not find they were obliged to continue in the ma&s;ter's &s;ervice, if they had not a &s;incere good will; that tho' they were required to labour for their ma&s;ter, yet it was every where enjoined in connection with good will. And therefore, as the ca&s;e now &s;tood, they being de&s;titute of good will, he had nothing to &s;ay to them from the ma&s;ter's orders. Wou'd the common &s;en&s;e of mankind approve of this conduct of the over&s;eer; his con&s;truction of the ma&s;ter's orders? Sure it would not.
<PB N="105" REF="010691_0115_0F81E32C07F621B8">
The ca&s;e, &s;o far as I &s;ee, is for &s;ub&s;tance parallel, and the application ea&s;y. And if &s;o: This mi&s;take, mu&s;t at lea&s;t) in part, be owing to the want of u&s;ing common &s;en&s;e, in under&s;tanding the &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another way in which it &s;eems &s;ome fall into this mi&s;take, is ungroundedly infering from the apo&s;tle James's direction to the &s;aints to pray in faith, nothing wavering, in order to a gracious acceptance, and &s;ecuring the ble&s;|&s;ings prayed for. They infer from this direction to the &s;aints, that prayer &s;hort of a gracious manner of performance, is in no &s;en&s;e required. The words are, <HI>If any of you lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God, that giveth unto all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it &s;hall be given him. But let him a&s;k in faith nothing wavering.</HI></P>
<P>Hence &s;ome that are, or have been publick teachers, infer, that the unregenerate are not required to pray: Others, that they are required to pray in faith, nothing wavering. And that prayer &s;hort of this, is in no &s;en&s;e required in the word of God. This, 'tis &s;aid, is the only go&s;pel way of teaching &s;inners to pray,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such divinity as this, one would &s;carce believe could be lodged in the brea&s;t of a rea&s;onable creature, much le&s;s in one under the advan|tages of divine revelation, and lea&s;t of all in a publick teacher. But when we turn our eyes and behold, the once famous towns, churches, and &s;ocieties, lying in ruin, broken, as in the place of dragons, altar erected again&s;t altar, to the number of four or five in a &s;ingle pari&s;h; uni|ver&s;al benevolence, with every &s;ocial and divine vertue, in a &s;ad degree bani&s;hed: And in the lieu thereof, &s;ome fond expre&s;&s;ions of good will towards their own party, only remaining: The adver&s;ary triumphing over all attempts to re&s;tore peace, charity, good order, and unanimity in the wor&s;hip of God; bold fact confronts our rea&s;on and compels us to believe, and lament, what our eyes unwillingly &s;ee.</NOTE> which to my be&s;t di&s;cernment, is the &s;ame with teaching, that the un|regenerate, while &s;uch, are not required to pray at all.</P>
<P>It being as impo&s;&s;ible in nature, while unregenerate and de&s;titute of holine&s;s, that they &s;hould pray in faith,
<PB N="106" REF="010691_0116_0F81E32C75DC2D70">
as for the &s;ame thing to be and not to be at the &s;ame time, according to that of &s;aint Paul; How &s;hall they call on him, i.e. in faith, in whom they have not be|lieved? i.e. before they have faith, and are believers; Is it po&s;&s;ible? By no means.</P>
<P>Now tho' it is readily conceeded, that the&s;e words of &s;aint James fully prove, that tho&s;e prayers only of the godly, that are made in faith intitle to acceptance with God, and to the ble&s;&s;ings pray'd for: Yet how do they prove, God don't require all, regenerate and unregene|rate, being of his vi&s;ible covenant people admitted by bapti&s;m, and thereby laid under &s;olemn vows, being trained up under the advantages of the go&s;pel, to be &s;in|cere chri&s;tians, to pray, &amp;c? How does it appear I &s;ay, from the&s;e words, that God don't require all the&s;e to pray and attend other chri&s;tian duties, tho' they fail and come &s;hort of a gracious manner, to &s;ome other wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es, as &s;een above? That prayer and other duties, tho' &s;hort of a gracious manner, are not required in order to acceptance with God, the&s;e words fully prove: Yet that the&s;e duties, as above, are not required to other wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es, (which is the only point here in debate) there is not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of proof: So that, if it be &s;till pleaded as a conclu&s;ion from this text, that prayer and other religious duties, that fall &s;hort of a gra|cious manner, are in no &s;en&s;e required of God's covenant people, it mu&s;t be a conclu&s;ion without premi&s;es.</P>
<P>Moreover, is it not a little &s;trange, that this text &s;hould be cho&s;e before all others, and be abundantly in&s;i&s;ted on, to prove that prayer &s;hort of what is here de&s;cribed, is in no &s;en&s;e required of the unregenerate? Since there is not one word of the unregenerate in the text. And &s;ince the words are expre&s;sly addre&s;t to a &s;et, perhaps, of the mo&s;t eminent &s;aints, that ever were upon earth: That forced
<PB N="107" REF="010691_0117_0F81E32EA7C66B38">
by the violence of per&s;ecution, had for&s;aken hou&s;es, lands, and all that was dear to them in this world for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, had put on the true &s;pirit of martyrdom, and were going; triumphant to glory, in the face of all the oppo&s;ition, chri&s;tianity can meet with from this world.</P>
<P>But that it may be &s;till more evident, if po&s;&s;ible, that this principle has no foundation in this, or any other &s;acred text, becau&s;e really untrue; I a&s;k leave to hint &s;ome of the many ab&s;urdities, that mu&s;t unavoidably fol|low on the admi&s;&s;ion of it. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. One is that the unregenerate, while &s;uch, are not required to pray at all; and by parity of rea&s;on, not re|quired to attend any other duty, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as they are not required to pray; &s;ince they can no more perform them in a gracious manner than they can prayer. And therefore, according to this principle, are in no &s;en&s;e required to perform them. Which immediately fixes us in the bowels of one of the leading errors of the new di|vinity, viz. that the way to obtain &s;aving faith, is not to be in que&s;t of it at all; or to have any concern about it, as quoted above.</P>
<P N="2">2ly. It terminates unavoidably in that well known opinion of the&s;e commonly called the Friends, viz. that no chri&s;tian duty is required of us, but as we are moved, by the &s;pirit, &s;ince according to this principle nothing is required of the unregenerate, and to be &s;ure not of the regenerate, &s;hort of praying in faith, nothing wavering; and &s;ince this can't be done but as moved and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;pirit: It mu&s;t needs follow, that they perfectly har|moni&s;e with the Friends in this point, as they do in many others.</P>
<P N="3">3ly. This principle virtually, and by undeniable con&s;e|quence, denies God hath appointed means of grace, to be attended on by his vi&s;ible covenant people, while unrege|nerate;
<PB N="108" REF="010691_0118_0F81E32F67D37AF8">
in order to obtain intere&s;t in his &s;aving mercy. Since if God has appointed means, undoubtedly a painful and diligent attendance on them is required. But this principle expre&s;sly denies the latter. And therefore vir|tually and truly the former.</P>
<P>Thus I might proceed, but am weary of repeating the ab&s;urdities ari&s;ing from this principle: Shall only add what our Saviour &s;aith in a &s;ingular ca&s;e, viz. <HI>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit.</HI> The &s;ame holds good, as to principles, if con&s;equences are rightly and truly drawn, a good principle cannot bring forth error and fal&s;hood.</P>
<P N="4">4. Others, as it appears to me, fall into this error, by a mi&s;taken way of rea&s;oning from the perfections of God, and the depravity of human nature. God, &s;ay they, is infinitely holy: The creature, while unregenerate, infi|nitely vile; at enmity with God, and hates him with his whole heart. And therefore it can't agree with the purity of God's nature, in any &s;en&s;e, to require any thing of the creature, while in this impure &s;tate; but that he immedi|ately comes out of it. This argument has by many been look'd upon, as a fundamental principle that cannot be &s;haken, whence tho&s;e queries, Can God require hypocri|cy? &amp;c. which have received an an&s;wer above. I &s;hall only add here, by the way a word, as to the unregene|rate's being required immediately to come out of that impure &s;tate. It by immediately coming out of that &s;inful &s;tate, be meant otherwi&s;e than by the medium of the go&s;pel, in the way of faith, What is a&s;&s;erted is not true: Since 'tis by the go&s;pel only that life and immortality it brought to light.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 10.</NOTE> But in this &s;en&s;e, by the medium of the go&s;pel, they are required to come out of that &s;inful &s;tate; does not this requirement imply in it a require|ment immediately to attempt faith, in a diligent attendance
<PB N="109" REF="010691_0119_0F81E33020C31D90">
on the go&s;pel, as the means, &s;earching the &s;criptures, in order to di&s;cover the divine original of the go&s;pel, the nature, nece&s;&s;ity and grounds of that faith, which is re|quired? And doth it not with equal clearne&s;s, require them to break off from all known &s;in? Since we are divinely a&s;&s;ured there is no imbracing Chri&s;t with any alowed wickedne&s;s hanging about us, tho' it be but the &s;ecret pride of the heart, <HI>How can ye believe who receive honour one of another?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. v. 44.</NOTE> Again, doth it not, at the &s;ame time, while in the painful attendance on other means, require them to &s;end up earne&s;t cries to heaven for mer|cy, tho' but the cries of peri&s;hing &s;inners? Since we are a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>none can come to the Son, except the Father draw them?</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Joh. vi. 44.</NOTE> And finally that all this be done by them with an earne&s;tne&s;s of concern, &s;uitable to the va&s;t importance of &s;alvation, above every thing el&s;e in this world? A|greeable to the general run of the &s;criptures, <HI>Labour not for the meat that peri&s;heth, but for that meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. vi. 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, is it not the &s;tate of thou&s;ands, that after having been commanded to believe, they remain &s;till in unbe|lief; and therefore, if ever it was their duty to attend on means in order to faith; it is equally &s;o &s;till.</P>
<P>Thus, if I mi&s;take not, the argument advanced to di&s;|charge the unregenerate from the u&s;e of means in order to faith, does &s;o long as they are de&s;titute of faith, indi&s;|&s;olubly bind them thereto.</P>
<P>But to proceed, tho&s;e that argue as above, don't &s;eem to under&s;tand, that man, tho' by his apo&s;tacy, he is become dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, alienated from holine&s;s, called the life of God, yet &s;till remains a rational creature, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of many natural and u&s;eful principles, &s;uch as na|tural con&s;cience, called the candle of the Lord, a light which God hath lighted up in man's &s;oul for his directi|on,

If not: then not to obey the dictates of natural con&s;cience, or to go abrea&s;t of them, would be no &s;in. <Q>Isn't natural con&s;cience implanted in all mankind, there to be as it were in God's &s;tead, and to be an internal judge or rule to all, whereby to di&s;tingui&s;h right and wrong.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards on the nat. of true vertue ch vii p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">, 180.</NOTE></Q> "Sin," &s;aith the &s;ame author, <Q>is not only again&s;t a &s;piritual and divine &s;en&s;e of vertue, but is al&s;o again&s;t the dictates of that moral &s;en&s;e, which is in natural con&s;cience.</Q> And does not the in&s;pired writings clearly teach us, that not to obey, or to go abrea&s;t of the dictates of natural con&s;cience is &s;in, and expo&s;es to condemnation, even tho' the judgment of con&s;cience relates to things indifferent, not morally good or evil in them&s;elves? <HI>There is</HI> (&s;ays the apo&s;tle) <HI>nothing unclean of it&s;elf; but to him that e&s;teemeth,</HI> i.e. in his con|&s;cience judgeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is un|clean.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ro. xiv. 14. 20. 23.</NOTE> He that doubteth is damned if he eat, becau&s;e he eateth not of faith, i.e. with a doubting con&s;cience.</P>

<P>The heinous nature of this &s;in, may be further &s;een, as it is &s;et forth by &s;aint Paul, in the heathen, as the ground of God's giving them up to a reprobate mind. Becau&s;e that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imagina|tions, &amp;c. wherefore God gave them up to uncleanne&s;s,
<PB N="111" REF="010691_0121_0F81E331A1BEBF88">
&amp;c. That a grievous &s;in is here charged, at lea&s;t on &s;ome of the heathen world, is evident from the heavy judgments that followed. The inquiry is, what that &s;in was? Was it &s;inning again&s;t &s;upernatural light, external or internal; which they had not? Or was it the want of gracious &s;incerity, in attending on the duties of God's wor&s;hip, which they made no pretence to? Sure it was none of the&s;e. But it was not acting up to the light and dictates of natural con&s;cience on natural principles, which they had. They were de&s;titute of natural gratitude to God, as a benefactor for benefits received, tho' they had matter of conviction before them, that God gave them rain, &amp;c. They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image, made like to corruptible man, and to birds and four footed bea&s;ts, and creeping things. Here again they acted beneath their natural principles, again&s;t the plain dictate of natural con&s;cience, that was full a|gain&s;t this &s;in, from the &s;hines of the glory of the Deity, from the creation of the world; in this they held the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, did not as men, as rea&s;onable creatures, in a natural way acknowledge the one living and true God, as not to be re&s;embled to, or repre&s;ented by images.</P>
<P>Should it be queried here, but of what avail could this glorifying God upon natural principles, &s;hort of a graci|ous manner, have been to them? Since it could neither have procured acceptance with God, nor have delivered them from condemnation.</P>
<P>An&s;wer, hereby they had not been &s;o exceedingly and unuterably wicked, nor &s;o ripened for the mo&s;t tremen|dous judgements that ever be&s;el apo&s;tate men in this world.</P>
<P>The only colourable ava&s;ion (&s;o far as I &s;ee) of the force of this text, which is full to my purpo&s;e; is by a&s;|&s;erting, that more is reproved, and implicitly required in
<PB N="112" REF="010691_0122_0F81E3325D754668">
the text, than meerly glorifying God on natural princi|ples. And therefore 'tis the want of this that is here re|proved, or the having of it, that is here required, and not any glorifying God in a lower &s;en&s;e. For an&s;wer, I &s;hall only leave this query, viz. Is it found rea&s;oning, to argue, that le&s;s is no way required, becau&s;e more is re|quired in which that le&s;s is contained? That a part is in no &s;en&s;e required, becau&s;e the whole is required, in which that part is contained?</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that obedience to the dictates of na|tural con&s;cience is required of the unregenerate, while &s;uch, notwith&s;tanding the impurity that attends their &s;tate.</P>
<P>Again, of this kind is the exerci&s;e or ju&s;tice, on natural principles, of pity to the mi&s;erable, of gratitude for bene|fits received, of love to God as a benefactor, meerly from a principle of &s;elf-love, of natural affection in pa|rents to children, &amp;c. Now tho' it is certain, that the&s;e ex|erci&s;es have nothing in them that is holy and &s;piritual, nothing but what the unregenerate may and &s;ome times do perform: Yet it is equally certain, at the &s;ame time, that the holy &s;criptures do &s;ome way require the&s;e things, where higher principles are wanting; otherwi&s;e the ab|&s;ence or want of them wou'd be no &s;in. The want of the higher exerci&s;es of a truly virtuous affection, grati|tude, pity, &amp;c. would be &s;in. But where the&s;e are want|ing, as they too frequently are in the regenerate, and al|ways in the unregenerate, it would be no &s;in in this ca&s;e to be without natural gratitude for benefits received; no &s;in to want natural pity to the mi&s;erable, no &s;in for parents to be de&s;titute of natural affection to children, &amp;c. If God's law no ways requires the&s;e things, to be without them, is no &s;in. Becau&s;e where there is no law, there can be no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ro. iv. 15.</NOTE> But we are taught even from the light of nature, and abundantly from the holy

&s;criptures, that the want of the&s;e things is an exceeding heinous &s;in. Not to multiply texts, we find in that blacke&s;t catalogue of mo&s;t atrocious wickedne&s;s, perhaps found on &s;acred record, that what crowns all, is the want of natural affection and compa&s;&s;ion, without natural af|fection, implacable, unmerciful, without natural affecti|on, i.e. falling below even the brutal nature, that is wont to retain that in&s;tinct of fondne&s;s to their young.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that whatever be the &s;tate to which mankind is reduced by the fall: Yet there is found in him &s;ome remains of natural principles and affections, which God requires &s;hould be pre&s;erved and exerci&s;ed; not becau&s;e there is any thing holy and &s;piritual in tho&s;e exerci&s;es; but becau&s;e in the omi&s;&s;ion and neglect of them, there is a greater degree of true moral evil; and a fur|ther remove from the exerci&s;e of a truly virtuous love to God, compa&s;&s;ion to the mi&s;erable, &amp;c. which the com|mand requires. And &s;ince we are expre&s;sly required to <HI>ab&s;tain from all,</HI> tho' but <HI>the appearance of evil;</HI> how much more, if po&s;&s;ible, are we required to ab&s;tain from this cer|tain greater degree of moral evil, in not regarding the dictates of natural con&s;cience, or not exerci&s;ing the&s;e na|tural principles when higher principles are wanting, as they always are in the unregenerate, or in not re&s;i&s;ting <Q>the habits of pride and &s;en&s;uality, which tends, &s;ays the fore-mentioned author,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;.

<P>For further confirmation of this truth, I might ob&s;erve, that all God's covenant people, are by bapti&s;m laid un|der sacred bonds to be &s;incere chri&s;tians, being trained up under the advantages of the go&s;pel. As circumci&s;i|on bound to keep the whole law; &s;o bapti&s;m binds to the &s;incere ob&s;ervance of all go&s;pel duties. Which im|plies

at lea&s;t all tho&s;e attempts and endeavours &amp; perform|ances they are capable of from natural principles, while higher are wanting; or which is the &s;ame, a con&s;cient|ious performance of the&s;e duties, tho' they fail of a gra|cious manner, for rea&s;ons once and again repeated above.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o alledge the practical acknowledgement of this truth, by all the regenerate, in their con&s;tant con|&s;cientious endeavours after obedience, tho' they fail of a gracious manner. So al&s;o of the unregenerate, &s;o far as they have not wa&s;ted their con&s;ciences, or corrupted their minds with error. And to the&s;e I have a ju&s;t right to add, the te&s;timony of all moral heathen (as to duties taught by the light of nature) &s;o far forth as they have not by di&s;&s;olute living infeebled their con&s;ciences, and rendered them unable to di&s;charge their natural office. But what needs all this, &s;ince we have the te&s;timony of God for it, as above? which infinitely out weighs that of the whole creation. What the ble&s;&s;ed God does, we are infinitely &s;ure, is con&s;i&s;tent with the purity of his na|ture. He cannot deny him&s;elf. This di&s;pute therefore, if I mi&s;take not, is now fini&s;hed. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Altho' it &s;hould be utterly beyond the power of the creature, to explicate and &s;hew the manner of this con&s;i&s;tency, between the infinite purity of God's nature, and the requirement of duties and &s;ervices of the unre|generate, infinitely vile; this I &s;ay, would be no argu|ment again&s;t the truth, that the weak intellect of the crea|ture, &s;hould not be able to under&s;tand the manner how 'tis reconciled; &s;ince the fact is certain. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Perhaps it mayn't be attended with in&s;uperable dif|ficulty, to reconcile this matter, and let it in a &s;atisfying light, to the unprejudiced. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. In order thereto, let it be con&s;idered, that God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> requiring the duty, don't require the &s;in, that attends

it, as before ob&s;erved. It is by accident that &s;in adheres to it. It is no part of the duty, as required by God, don't belong to its e&s;&s;ence; but ari&s;es from man's deficiency. God has a right to require of his people good duties. When he puts them under go&s;pel advantages, plants them as trees in his vineyard by bapti&s;m, under divine cultiva|tion, he requires go&s;pel holine&s;s. A prevalent indi&s;po&s;i|tion of heart, and di&s;inclination of will, to do right, called moral impotency, makes no abatement in God's demands of us; or in the duty we owe to God. Thus then &s;tands the ca&s;e, God puts his covenant people under advantages to bring forth good fruits, and then as he has a ju&s;t right, expects and demands them. Wherefore when I looked that it &s;hould bring forth grapes, &amp;c. God requires good duties of his people; both the performance and the goodne&s;s of the duty is ab&s;olutely required: And there|fore, God will have the duties or performances, tho' thro' their badne&s;s they come mar'd out of their hands. Does God in requiring the&s;e duties, require their being mar'd? Far be it. Since he ab&s;olutely required their being good. So that there does not appear the lea&s;t &s;hadow of any grounds of reflection on the purity of God's nature, in requiring the&s;e duties of his covenant people, tho' they fall &s;hort of being performed in a gracious manner. But,</P>
<P N="2">2ly. Let it be further con&s;idered here, that the&s;e per|formances, as above, whether of the regenerate or unre|generate, are not &s;o mar'd, as,</P>
<P N="1">1. Not to &s;erve great and important purpo&s;es worthy of God, &s;uch as the advancement of his vi&s;ible honour and glory in the world, and the good of his covenant people, as &s;een above. Nor,</P>
<P N="2">2. Are they &s;o mar'd as not to be le&s;s &s;inful, than the omi&s;&s;ion of them would be. And therefore it agrees to the purity of God's nature to require them.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="010691_0126_0F81E33559162E20">When the doing of an action has made greater moral evil in it, than the forbearance; tho' the forbearance fail of being gracious, and &s;o is &s;inful in the manner of it, meerly through the default of the creature: It agrees to the purity of God's nature to require the forbearance. This is the ca&s;e with regard to murder, adultery, and all other kinds of wickedne&s;s: God requires his covenant people to forbear the commi&s;&s;ion of them, tho' the man|ner of their forbearance being &s;hort of gracious, is &s;inful; becau&s;e the commi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e &s;ins is a much greater moral evil. And therefore it agrees to the purity of God's nature to require the forbearance.</P>
<P>So on the other hand, when the total omi&s;&s;ion of duties required, is a much greater moral evil, than meerly fail|ing of a gracious manner in the performance, it agrees to the purity of God's nature to require the performance of them. And this is the ca&s;e with regard to go&s;pel duties required of God's vi&s;ible covenant people. Nor is there, to my &s;mall di&s;cernment, the lea&s;t appearance of any in|con&s;i&s;tency in the ca&s;e. Nay, &s;o far from it, that the&s;e prohibitions of the practice of wickedne&s;s, and require|ments of duties of all God's covenant people, tho' they fail of a gracious manner perfectly harmoni&s;e with the purity of God's nature, and nece&s;&s;arily flow from it. Since that infinite purity that requires ab&s;taining from all moral evil, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily require ab&s;taining from every higher degree of it, that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the creature is morally capable of. Where it mu&s;t &s;till be remember|ed, that neither the &s;inful manner of performing duty, or refraining from the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, is required by God, either in forbidding the one, or requiring the other. So that there is not the lea&s;t appearance of incon&s;i&s;tency in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>

<PB N="117" REF="010691_0127_0F81E3371BE44DF8">
not, it is to be remembered, the truth above remains un|&s;haken.</P>
<P>However, as it has been &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on, and come into by &s;ome per&s;ons, otherwi&s;e of good di&s;cernment and penetration, that it can't agree to the purity of God's nature, to require the unregenerate to pray, while &s;uch, becau&s;e of that in&s;incerity and hypocri&s;y, that mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily attend the performance; I a&s;k leave to mention what in part has been more than once mentioned, viz. That if this principle is admitted, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fol|low, that for the &s;ame rea&s;on it can't agree to the purity of God, to require of the unregenerate, while &s;uch, any other duty, &s;uch as the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice, charity, &amp;c. or the refraining from any moral evil, &s;uch as bowing down to idols, murder, adultery, &amp;c. Since in&s;ince|rity and hypocri&s;y in refraining from the latter, or prac|ticing the former, can no more agree to the purity of God's nature, than in&s;incerity in prayer. And is not this an amazing &s;tretch in the new divinity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The new divinity, &s;o far as I have been able to acquaint my&s;elf, as to the point in hand, terminates very much in this, viz. God pa&s;&s;es by the unregenerate world, as a confu&s;ed chaos, uncapable in their pre|sent &s;tate, of acting any thing agreeable to his will; and therefore &s;ays nothing to them, &s;ave only, believe and repent, i.e. come out of that wretched &s;tate. And hence it is, that when they are in &s;ome &s;ort forc|ed to allow hearing the word, otherwi&s;e an end is put to their preach|ing; one who was a publick teacher, it &s;eems be&s;t it &s;hould be under|&s;tood, that hearing was a duty God required of the unregenerate, pub|lickly remon&s;trating again&s;t that notion; ob&s;erving that tho' it was in the nature of things nece&s;&s;ary, that per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;ome way acquainted with the go&s;pel, in order to faith; yet that it was a matter of no man|ner of importance, or concern with what temper of mind or view, they came to hear the word. That if young men came with no other de|&s;ign than to &s;ee the young women, it was quite as likely they would be met with by &s;overeign grace, as coming with any other view they were capable of, while unregenerate.</P>

<P>I conclude this head, with a brief ob&s;ervation of &s;ome of the an&s;wers to que&s;tions of importance, relating to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, u&s;ually given by &s;uch as are, or have been publick teachers, in favour of the new divinity, viz.</P>
<P>Que&s;. What mu&s;t the unregenerate do, as a means under the go&s;pel, in order to obtain faith?</P>
<P>An&s;. Not be in que&s;t of it at all, i.e. have no concern at all about it, as quoted above.</P>
<P>Que&s;. Is it their duty to pray?</P>
<P>An&s;. Is it their duty to kneel down, and pray to the &s;tump of a tree? An unregenerate man knows no more of God than an old &s;tump.</P>
<P>Que&s;. Does God require them to pray?</P>
<P>An&s;. Does God require hypocri&s;y, or mockery of his creatures? The prayer of an unregenerate man, is a meer mocking of God.</P>
<P>Que&s;. Propo&s;ed by the preacher to the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>An&s;. I have nothing from the word of God, requiring unregenerate to pray. I don't &s;ay, they mu&s;t not; pray.</P>
<P>Que&s;. But what is your real opinion, Sir? Is it their duty to pray, or not?</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="010691_0129_0F81E3385D5162E8">An&s;. I teach 'tis their duty to pray, ju&s;t as the word of God teacheth, in faith, nothing wavering. And that prayer &s;hort of this, is in no &s;en&s;e required of the unrege|nerate. A reply.</P>
<P>The four fir&s;t of the&s;e an&s;wers, agree in one, and plumply deny, that the unregenerate, while &s;uch, are re|quired to pray.</P>
<P>The la&s;t, if it means any thing, mu&s;t, tho' in different words expre&s;t, mean the &s;ame thing. When 'tis &s;aid, they are required to pray in &s;aith; the meaning mu&s;t be either,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That they are required to act &s;aith, while in an unregenerate, i.e. in an unholy &s;tate; which, as faith is an holy act, implies in it a contradiction, a thing impo&s;|&s;ible in nature, according to that of our Saviour, A cor|rupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2ly. The meaning mu&s;t be, that they are required fir&s;t to come out of that unregenerate, unholy &s;tate; and then pray. In which ca&s;e, it is certain, the unregenerate are not required to pray. So that this la&s;t an&s;wer, tho' expre&s;t in different words, is &s;trictly the &s;ame in &s;en&s;e with the former, viz. that the unregenerate, while &s;uch, are not required to pray.</P>
<P>Very ob&s;ervable here, is the tractiblene&s;s of the &s;cholars, tho' not &s;o bold as to u&s;e the matter's expre&s;&s;ions; yet &s;trict to keep to his &s;en&s;e.

<P>Here I appeal, once for all, to learned and unlearned, and even to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, acquainted with divine revelation, whether the&s;e an&s;wers are con&s;i&s;|tent with the &s;criptures of truth; with a right under|&s;tanding
<PB N="120" REF="010691_0130_0F81E33944B56DD8">
of man's lap&s;ed &s;tate; or the true &s;tate of God's vi&s;ible covenant people under the go&s;pel, including, &s;uch as are admitted by bapti&s;m, and trained up under the ad|vantages of the go&s;pel? Nay, whether all the&s;e are not as really and truly, tho' but virtually and implicitly, re|quired to deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world, tho' they fail of a gracious manner, and act only on principles of nature, as explained above; as they are to do all this on higher principles; which, while unregenerate, they have not? Since to do their duties, is as ab&s;olutely re|quired, as to do them on higher principles. Both are ab|&s;olutely required, even the whole of duty: And therefore, &s;o are the parts. This doing of them, i.e. denying un|godline&s;s, &amp;c. as above, being an e&s;&s;ential part of the whole; and &s;o belonging to its e&s;&s;ence, as that the duty can't be performed without it: It is therefore as truly re|quired as the other part, viz. a right manner; or as the whole it&s;elf, of which it is an e&s;&s;ential part.</P>
<P>Nor am I able to conceive, as hath been ob&s;erved, that a failure in one part of duty, &s;hould be able to di&s;charge from obligation to the other, or that failing of perform|ing a duty on higher principles, &s;hould free from the o|bligation of performing it on &s;uch principles as they have, even if but tho&s;e of natural con&s;cience; especially when an hone&s;t attempt to do duties, as commanded, it virtu|ous principles are wanting, nece&s;&s;arily terminates in a per|formance on the&s;e lower principles of natural con&s;cience. So that, as &s;ure as they are required hone&s;tly to attempt duty in a right manner; they are required, if they fail of a right manner, as the unregenerate, while &s;uch, al|ways do, to perform them con&s;cientiou&s;ly; becau&s;e a con|&s;cientious performance of duty, in the ca&s;e propo&s;ed, in evidently implied in the hone&s;t attempt required.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="010691_0131_0F81E339DC192938">Nor do I &s;ee how any publick teacher, not convinced that he hath authority from Chri&s;t, to enforce prayer and other go&s;pel duties on all God's vi&s;ible covenant people, tho' they &s;hould fail of a gracious manner, can have a better right to the continuance of his office as a go&s;pel mi|ni&s;ter, than the over&s;eer, above mentioned had to his office, when he taught his Lord's &s;ervants to de&s;i&s;t from their ma&s;ter's work, if they found the want of a good temper towards him.</P>
<P>Obj. VIII. Finally, &s;hould it be objected here, that 'twas needle&s;s to carry a debate on the&s;e things, to &s;o great a length.</P>
<P>For an&s;wer, in&s;tead of many things, (which, with me, are weighty) that might be replied, I &s;hall only appeal to all, where the new divinity has rai&s;ed di&s;putes to the greate&s;t height, divided towns, broke &s;ocieties and church|es, alienated affection among dear brethren, &amp;c. Whe|ther the&s;e que&s;tions have not been as warmly debated as any what&s;oever, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether God requires the unregenerate, while &s;uch, to pray, reform known evils, and with great diligence and painfulne&s;s, attend on means of grace? And,</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether if they do &s;o, they are more in the way in which God is wont to be&s;tow his &s;aving mercy, or more likely to obtain it, than if they continued &s;ecure, in the carele&s;s neglect of means, going on in their &s;ins?</P>
<P>That the negative part of the&s;e que&s;tions, hath been roundly a&s;&s;erted, and &s;erenuou&s;ly pleaded for, is a truth &s;o well known as needs nothing to be &s;aid in confirmati|on of it; which I take to be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to the objection.</P>
<P>The only apology I &s;hall make, for throwing things together, that are differently expre&s;t, as above, is their near affinity and tendency, as it appears to me, in the
<PB N="122" REF="010691_0132_0F81E33C0B045BB8">
main to much the &s;ame. Whether the unregenerate un|der the go&s;pel be taught they are not required to pray, &amp;c. or, that if they do &s;o, they are not more likely to obtain grace: Or &s;hould it be conceeded, as above, they are more likely to obtain grace, in a vigorous exertion of them&s;elves, as above; yet at the &s;ame time, on the whole, more vile in God's &s;ight, than they would have been had they continued in the wilful carele&s;s neglect of means, giving a loo&s;e to all manner of mo&s;t abominable wicked|ne&s;s, under the &s;ame external means of light.</P>
<P>The&s;e things, to the be&s;t of my &s;mall di&s;cernment, na|turally tend, either to quiet &s;ecure &s;inners in the carele&s;s neglect of means, going on in their &s;ins; or to damp and retard tho&s;e that are &s;eriou&s;ly inclined to exert them&s;elves, in a painful attendance on means and amendment of life. Since every &s;tep they take in this way, while unregene|rate, they are on the whole involved in greater guilt, than they would have been had they continued in the wilful carele&s;s neglect of means, ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t wickedne&s;s, as above, under the &s;ame go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Should it be pleaded here, that there is no incon&s;i&s;ten|cy in its being the duty of the unregenerate, thus to exert them&s;elves in the u&s;e of means, and their becoming on the whole more vile, &amp;c. &s;ince their greater vilene&s;s ari&s;eth not from tho&s;e exertions of them&s;elves; but from the de&s;perate &s;infulne&s;s of their natures; and is meerly their fault. And therefore can by no means be pleaded in bar of their duty.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, &s;hould this be ever &s;o fully conceeded, it would be nothing to the author's purpo&s;e, &s;o long as this hypothe&s;is, implicitly wrapt up in it, is intirely without proof, viz. that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for the unregenerate, while &s;uch, to what ever degree of wickedne&s;s they are reduc|ed, under the go&s;pel, &s;o to apply them&s;elves to atten|dance

on means and amendment of life, as not on the whole, to be more vile in God's &s;ight, than they would have been in the neglect of that application, abandoning them&s;elves to the practice of all manner of mo&s;t abomina|ble wickedne&s;s, under the &s;ame go&s;pel. If (I &s;ay) this is po&s;&s;ible, what may be, and &s;ometimes is the ca&s;e with the unregenerate, through the common influence of the &s;pirit under the go&s;pel, as &s;een above.

And if this be al|lowed to be po&s;&s;ible, as I think hath been proved, then to deny it, is to deny the truth, and to lay a &s;tumbling block in &s;inners way, and to rob them of a precious branch of encouragement allowed them from the word of God, to &s;trive and run for eternal life, in all painful en|deavours in the u&s;e of means. Which none can doubt would be doing great injury to precious &s;ouls. For if (as is well known) under the law, great care was expre&s;&s;|ly required to prepare the way to the city of refuge, i.e. to remove all &s;tumbling-blocks, and what ever might impeed, or di&s;courage the &s;layer in his earne&s;t attempt to flee thether, in order to e&s;cape the avenger of blood: How much more under the go&s;pel, is it a matter of importance that the utmo&s;t &s;cripture-encouragement be &s;et before &s;inners, to excite their earne&s;t endeavours in the u&s;e of means, as the way in order to make their e&s;cape to Chri&s;t the true city of refuge?</P>
<P>And &s;ince the proof of this impo&s;&s;ibility to the unre|generate, as above, plainly implied in the author's point advanced, with which it mu&s;t &s;tand or fall, is at lea&s;t attended with great doubtfulne&s;s, and &s;ince 'tis a point that is new, hitherto not known or taught by the refor|mation: If after all, it &s;hould be judged nece&s;&s;ary it be

further vindicated; it &s;eems highly riqui&s;ite it &s;hould be &s;et in a demon&s;trative, clear, &s;cripture light, and what has been &s;aid in favour of the negative fairly refuted.</P>
<P>To conclude, all I &s;hall add, is, that whatever may be the mi&s;take attending what I have here wrote, I am not con&s;cious of any; or that I have in the lea&s;t been moved from a di&s;putatious temper, or any want of re&s;pect to the worthy author; whom I highly e&s;teem, tho' at the &s;ame time, I have not been able to per&s;uade my&s;elf, but that &s;ome things have by him been carried too far in favour of what is commonly called the Sandemanean error, and by fair con&s;truction, ju&s;tly liable to exception. If there|fore this humble attempt may only be an occa&s;ion of tho&s;e things being &s;et right, and in a more evident and clear &s;cripture light, I &s;hall not think my pains wholly lo&s;t. On which &s;ide the mi&s;take lies, is intirely &s;ubmit|ted to the candid and judicious reader.</P>
