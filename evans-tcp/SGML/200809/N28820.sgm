<HEAD><HI>MEMOIRS OF</HI> Charles Dennis Ru&s;oe D'Eres, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born in the city of Quebec<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Metropolis of Lower Canada.</NOTE>, on the &s;eventh day of April, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty one, of parents much re&s;pected. My father, who&s;e name was Luois Ru&s;oe D'Eres, in early life acquired the black&s;mith's bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;oon after his freedom from his ma&s;ter, he &s;ettled in the city, and by indu&s;try in a &s;hort time acquired much property. My mother was a de&s;cendant from a family of good reputation in Que|bec. My parents lived in the conjugal life upwards of twenty-five years, during this period, my mother bore &s;ixteen children, of which number I was the younge&s;t; twelve of my father's children died previous to my birth. My mother died &s;oon after I was born. My being left by my mother, at &s;o early a period of life, naturally drew my father's attention to me, I therefore &s;oon engro&s;&s;ed his affections, and was care&s;&s;ed by him and his family; retiring from bu&s;ine&s;s he frequently dandled me on his knee, and with tears droping from
<PB N="8" REF="038422_0003_1011E95443A50F48">
his eyes, would, with a deep &s;igh, exclaim ah, my little &s;on! thy mother, under who&s;e watchful eye thy educa|tion would (under the &s;miles of Providence, have been conducted with the clo&s;e&s;t attention, and doubtle&s;s with happy &s;ucce&s;s, is now no more; in you I behold traces of her countenance, &amp; at times almo&s;t lo&s;e the keenne&s;s of my &s;orrows, occa&s;ioned by my lo&s;s in her. May you, my dear &s;on, be continued for my comfort, through the future &s;tages of my life, and a prop to thy fond father through his declining days. Such language as the foregoing, I was frequently entertained with, but alas! his joy and good wi&s;hes for future days of happy enjoyment were &s;oon, too &s;oon cut off, as by the &s;ub&s;equent Narrative will appear.</P>
<P>My father being frequently called from a private to a public life, had many opportunities in political &s;cience to improve his mind; about this time, that is, when I arrived at the fourteenth year of my age, 'twas frequently mentioned in private circles of friends in Quebec, that a rupture would &s;oon take place between Great Britain, and &s;ome (at lea&s;t) of her American Colonies. My father obtained the be&s;t information con|cerning the di&s;pute, &s;oon determined in favour of the Colonies, and being fully per&s;uaded that their oppo&s;i|tion to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, would prove &s;ucce&s;sful, he ardently wi&s;hed for an opportunity of proving his faith by his works. In October, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-five, General Montgomery, with
<PB N="9" REF="038422_0004_1011E957CA034B20">
a large number of troops from Newengland, entered the borders of Canada, with an intention of reducing it to the American &s;tandard. The troops made rapid pro|gre&s;s towards Quebec, without much oppo&s;ition. The then commander in chief of Canada<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lton.</NOTE>, i&s;&s;ued his proc|lamation, giving liberty to &s;uch of the Inhabitants of Quebec as cho&s;e to leave the city, to depart within a limited time, with &s;uch of their per&s;onal property as they &s;hould choo&s;e to carry, promi&s;ing tho&s;e per&s;ons a re&s;toration of &s;uch real property as they &s;hould leave behind them (provided the rebellious army &s;hould not &s;ucceed in their propo&s;ed plan) my father availed him|&s;elf of this, and moved with his family, and &s;uch of his per&s;onal property, as were portable to St. Nicola, nine miles from Quebec. Leaving in the city, real property to a large amount, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;pacious dwelling-hou&s;e, built with &s;tone and lime, and covered with tin, over which were layed &s;everal coats of paint, to pre&s;erve the tin from ru&s;t&mdash;a large black&s;mith's &s;hop with tools &s;ufficient to employ many workmen: he then be|ing imployed in the King's works, with many other buildings for dome&s;tic u&s;e. My father &s;oon became acquainted with General Montgomery, with whom he took an active part again&s;t the Briti&s;h government, and was honored with a Captain's commi&s;&s;ion, and with the army marched to Quebec, with a view to reduce it to the American faith. A general con&s;ultation among the officers, took place re&s;pecting the
<PB N="10" REF="038422_0005_1011E959579B3298">
mode of procedure again&s;t the city; the re&s;ult whereof, was, to &s;torm it. An attempt accordingly took place on the la&s;t day of December, one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and &s;eventy five. In the attempt the valiant Montgomery fell, with &s;ome of his officers and men, the major part of his army were taken and impri&s;oned; &s;ome few only e&s;caped, among tho&s;e, were my father &amp; only brother. My father, apprehen&s;ive of the evil con|&s;equence of his &amp; their conduct, in taking up arms again&s;t the King, endeavoured not only to &s;ecret him&s;elf &amp; &s;on from the royal hunters; but al&s;o to &s;ecure as many of his followers, as was in his power. He owning a coal hut in the woods, not far from St. Nicola, concluded there to hide them; to this place they retired, intend|ing to tarry until the Briti&s;h wrath &s;ub&s;ided; but even in this retreat they were di&s;covered. My Father hav|ing learned this, immediately furni&s;hed as many of them as was in his power, with provi&s;ion, a pocket compa&s;s, and other nece&s;&s;aries, bid them &s;hift for them&s;elves; while he and his &s;on returned to St. Nicola, to provide them&s;elves with nece&s;&s;aries, intending to flee to a more di&s;tant and more &s;afe retreat: all which by &s;ecret intel|ligence, reached the ears of the Commander in Chief at Quebec, who immediately &s;ent an officer, with a num|ber of men to St. Nicola, and made my father, brother, &amp; my&s;elf, though young, pri&s;oners; my two &s;i&s;ters made their e&s;cape, by jumping out of the chamber windows. The officer ordered his men to fire my father's hou&s;e, and turn the cattle out of the barn, and to burn that
<PB N="11" REF="038422_0006_1011D05C6AB56150">
al&s;o, which was &s;oon done, and in a few moments both buildings were levelled with the ground. We were carried pri&s;oners to the city, in the night, and confined in the guard hou&s;e; next day at ten o'clock (the time of relieving the guard,) we were brought before the general officers, who, after a lengthy trial, pronounced the following &s;entence, viz. that my father and brother &s;hould be confined in the common goal, there to re|main until the then war &s;hould clo&s;e; they then turn|ing to me, attentively viewing me, ob&s;erving my &s;len|der &amp; youthfull appearance, being then fourteen years and eight months old, &s;aid one to the other, what &s;hall we do with this little yankee, this little rebel? it will not do to put him in goal, he will die there in 2 or 3 days, let us &s;aid one, give him to the Indians; let them take him, kill him, &s;calp him, or do what they will with him. My dear father, on hearing this &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed on me, faint|ed and fell to the ground. I in the utmo&s;t agony cried and begged to be relea&s;ed from the &s;entence, but all to no purpo&s;e. I &s;prang to my father, cla&s;ped my arms round his neck and ki&s;&s;ed him. On his recovery, he pleaded earne&s;tly that I might not be given to the In|dians; but all in vain, they violently pulled me from him and pu&s;hed me towards the Indians, &s;aying, take that little Yankee, that little Rebel, and kill, or &s;calp him; do with him as you plea&s;e; on which one In|dian took me by the hand and forced me from my dear|e&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="038422_0007_1011E95F18012C10">
connections: &s;aying, go with us, we no kill you; we no hurt you; he French boy.</P>
<P>I &s;oon learned that the Indians, to whom I was giv|en, were of the Scanyawtauraguohrooote tribe, and that they lived no le&s;s than fifteen hundred miles from Que|bec. Thus far, reader, I have led you on in my narra|tive without a realizing &s;en&s;e of my certain doom; now, nothing left me but a &s;mall glimmer of hope, that at &s;ome far di&s;tant period, if life remained I might once more reali&s;e my freedom and enjoy the tender em|braces of an affectionate and tender father, brother and &s;i&s;ters; but oh! how can I de&s;cribe my &s;ituation! forced from my father, and forbid the tender embrace of a beloved brother and of near, dear and truly affec|tionate &s;i&s;ters, now under the controul of &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s, who&s;e tender mercies are cruelty. My at|tachment to the beloved city, was &s;o great, that my dread of future evil, did not prevent my keeping my wi&s;hful eyes on it; particularly on that part in which my father dwelt.</P>
<P>The Indians retired from Quebec to the country, not forgetting to take me with them; I found that re|&s;i&s;tance was in vain, I therefore, with apparent cheer|fulne&s;s, trip'd along with them, frequently turning my glazed eyes towards them, and viewing, with horror,
<PB N="13" REF="038422_0008_1011E962DA49ACE0">
their Indian dre&s;s, and uncouth appearance; but, con|trary to my fears, they u&s;ed me tenderly in their way; the Squaws appeared more mild and tender, than the men; fawned over and flattered me, and by this mean, I became more familiar with them, and frequently u&s;ed to run to them for protection, when I thought my&s;elf in danger from the men; for &s;everal days, I &s;carce|ly eat or drank with them, their provi&s;ion and mode of living, being &s;o di&s;agreeable to me, that I was much reduced for want of proper food. After being with them about fifteen days, I became in a mea&s;ure, recon|ciled to them, and u&s;ed much familiarity with them. One day an Indian Chief, took me by my hand, and with apparent good humour, told me I mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed like them, and bid me pull off my breeches, which I re|luctantly did; he then put on me a clout, and belt, In|dian-fa&s;hion, and threw my breeches into the fire, where they were &s;oon con&s;umed; he with a hearty laugh, or|dered me to &s;trip off my other garments, which I read|ily obeyed, and they &s;hared the &s;ame &s;ate with my bree|ches; he then completely dre&s;&s;ed me in an Indian uni|form, con&s;i&s;ting of a blanket, feathers, &amp;c; giving me a &s;tone pipe and tobacco pouch; then painted my face, according to their cu&s;tom, and told me that was to make me look fine; then flattered me, &s;aying, you be good boy me give you little tomahawk, fine cap and broaches; me no give you name now, me &s;ee how you behave, then give you name; you be bold like big man,
<PB N="14" REF="038422_0009_1011E964637B86D0">
me give you name like great King; you be coward, and be like Squaw, me give you little name like Squaw.</P>
<P>About three months after I was given to the In|dians, they received the thanks of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, (for their good behaviour,) and large pre&s;ents, and were permitted to return to their own country. They di|rected their cour&s;e to fort Michilimackinac, nine hundred miles northwe&s;t of Montreal; nothing very material, for or again&s;t me, turned up during this route; each day I attentively li&s;tened to their language, and by de|grees learned to &s;peak to, and an&s;wer them tolerably well; in this, the Squaws were peculiarly helpful. At the above de&s;cribed place, we tarried two months, where the Indians built birch canoes, &s;ufficient to carry five hundred per&s;ons with their implements for hunting, and fi&s;hing. There we drew provi&s;ion from the king's &s;tore; but not allowed rum for daily u&s;e, with which the Indians appeared tolerably &s;atisfied, having the promi&s;e of as much as they could drink the la&s;t day of their tarry. After completing their canoes, the day of departure arrived, and they received a large quantity of rum, of which they drank &s;o freely, that they &s;oon became intoxicated, almo&s;t to a man, &s;o that but a few were able to take care of the pre&s;ents, made them as a|bove related. This &s;tate of intoxication la&s;ted until the next day, when, in&s;tead of departing, they begged for more rum, but being denied, they &s;oon became tu|multuous,
<PB N="15" REF="038422_0010_1011E9671594FE70">
and attempted to break into the king's &s;tores, which was &s;oon effected. They turned out a number of hog&s;heads of rum, the garri&s;on being unable to prevent it; of cour&s;e, the Indians &s;oon became drunk, and a general clamour &s;ucceeded, with fighting, Sanop a|gain&s;t Squaw, and Squaw again&s;t Sanop, to that de|gree, that many were in danger of lo&s;ing their limbs, if not life al&s;o. This fray continued until the rum was wholly exhau&s;ted. During this frolick, about &s;ixty In|dians of the Shawanee tribe, came in birch canoes load|ed with fur, propo&s;ing to trade at the fort; the Indians, of whom I now was counted one, &s;oon began to quar|rel with the Shawanee Indians, engaged them with hel|li&s;h fury, and &s;laughtered the whole number in the mo&s;t barbarous manner, cutting open their bodies, while a|live, tearing out their bowels, plucking their hearts from their bodies, and greedily eating them, even while palpitating in their hands; ince&s;&s;antly yelling and whooping during the carnage, which was followed by a total de&s;truction of their canoes, and furs.</P>
<P>After &s;pending five days in the manner above de&s;|cribed, we took our departure from Michilimakinak down Lake Superior. Here it may not be ami&s;s to de&s;|cribe Michilimakinak, and Lake Superior.</P>
<P>Michilimackinac, is an i&s;land near the entrance of Lake Superior, and takes its name from the appearance
<PB N="16" REF="038422_0011_1011E96ADC21C070">
of a certain i&s;land, lying about &s;ix, or &s;even miles northea&s;t, within &s;ight, which at a di&s;tance appears not unlike an animal, called a Tortoi&s;e; the word Michili|makinak, in the Indian language, &s;ignifying a Tor|to&s;e. On this i&s;land of Michilimakinak, is a &s;tockaded fort, u&s;ually defended with one hundred men; here are about thirty or forty dwelling-hou&s;es, one of which, belongs to the governor, and another to the commi&s;&s;ary; &s;everal traders from different quarters al&s;o, dwell with|in its fortifications; here trade is carried on with In|dians, from almo&s;t all parts of America.</P>
<P>Lake Superior, is &s;o called on account of its &s;uperi|ority in magnitude to any of the lakes on the continent of America, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the large&s;t body of fre&s;h water on the globe; in circumference, is &s;aid to be &s;ixteen hundred miles.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to French Charts.</NOTE></P>
<P>Having de&s;cribed, as I propo&s;ed, the i&s;land of Michilimakinak, and Lake Superior, according to the be&s;t information I am able to obtain, I now proceed in my narrative.</P>
<P>Steering in our canoes (as near as I could gue&s;s,) northwe&s;t, we were &s;oon overtaken with a heavy gale of wind, which continued three days and nights; dur|ing which, we laboured hard to keep our canoes before the wind, to prevent up&s;etting, not being able to gain
<PB N="17" REF="038422_0012_1011E96D803CB6F8">
the &s;hore on either &s;ide, by rea&s;on of huge rocks and banks, which in many places were nearly perpendicular. On the fourth day the wind abated, towards even|ing we di&s;covered an i&s;land to which we paddled and landed thereon; where we tarried four or five days to refre&s;h our&s;elves, and to catch &s;ome game and fi&s;h, to recruit our &s;tores. Here we caught many fi&s;h of vari|ous kinds; the lake abounding in fi&s;h, &s;uch as Trout, Pike, Pickerel and Porch, with many others, for which I want names.</P>
<P>Having provided our&s;elves with provi&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of fi&s;h, and fle&s;h, &s;uch as the i&s;land afforded, we took our departure from the i&s;le, and continued our voyage notherly, and in about thirty days, catching fi&s;h as of|ten as occa&s;ion required, not quitting our canoes day nor night, we were obliged to eat our &s;weet mor&s;els uncooked; realizing that barking &s;tomacks &s;train no compliments. We arrived at the mouth of Maccatah River, which comes from &s;tupendous mountains, lying far north from this river's mouth, which is about thirty feet wide, the waters whereof, are of an extraordinary quality, being very thick, of a greeni&s;h colour, and un|fit for u&s;e. This river runs from the mountains with great rapidity; at the bottom of which, at its entrance into the lake, are di&s;covered large rocks of a redi&s;h ca&s;t, which our Indians called blood-&s;tone, at a &s;hort di&s;tance north, from this river's mouth, a very &s;ingular opening
<PB N="18" REF="038422_0013_1011E96F0E12C0B0">
appears on the &s;ide of a mountain, apparently cut through &s;olid rock, which is very hard each &s;ide of the entrance, is of a black colour, and very &s;mooth; the entrance is about thirty feet diameter, and continues of this magnitude &s;ome way into the mountain; many of the Indians repeatedly with lighted torches, have at|tempted to trace it to its utmo&s;t extent; but hitherto have failed, not being able to keep torches burning for any length of time, gave over &s;earching further. The rock at the entrance is ornamented with curious carvings of various kinds, &s;uch as animals of different forms, &s;ome appear &s;u&s;pended from the rock, of different &s;hapes, in a mo&s;t curious manner, all which our Indians could not account for. The elde&s;t of them ob&s;erved, that &s;uch has been its appearance ever &s;ince they had any knowledge of the place. But what I have now to relate is &s;till more marvellous.</P>
<P>During our tarry at this place were heard, at all times, voices, not unlike the crying of young children, as if in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. In the morning are plainly &s;een on the &s;mooth &s;and on the beach, at the mouth of this horrible cavern, marks like foot-&s;teps of children; and, although &s;moothed down in the morning, the fol|lowing morning &s;imilar marks will appear, as nume|rous as the preceeding day. From this place we con|tinued our cour&s;e north for two days and one night in our canoes, and arrived at the Red River, which takes
<PB N="19" REF="038422_0014_1011E971969718A8">
its ri&s;e from Lake Superior, and runs a &s;outhwe&s;terly cour&s;e very rapidly; in which are many falls. We paddled down this river forty days, frequently &s;hooting over falls with &s;uch force, that our canoes &s;ometimes would &s;kip out of the water; but &s;uch was their con|&s;truction, that they would always fall on their bottoms, being properly balanced by their navigators falling flat on their backs within them. Many falls were &s;o tremen|dous, that we were obliged to haul out our canoes and carry them on our backs by land, until pa&s;&s;ing the rap|ids, &s;lide them into the river and pur&s;ue our cour&s;e. We arrived at an i&s;land in this river, after forty days &s;ail from its mouth. Here we tarried five or &s;ix days to furni&s;h our&s;elves with a new recruit of provi&s;ion. Soon after our landing, &s;ix Indians, belonging to the Annoowechen Tribe, made us a vi&s;it in their canoes, con&s;tructed &s;omething different from ours, both in form and ornament. Tho&s;e Indians came, as they &s;aid, with an intention to inform us of &s;omething greatly to our advantage, and if we would make them &s;ome good pre&s;ents, we &s;hould be let into the &s;ecret&mdash;whereupon, we gave each one a blanket, and they then informed us, that the Annoowechen Tribe had heard of our return from Canada, and of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing many valuable pre&s;ents, made us, when there; and of their intention to &s;urpri&s;e and rob us before the next morning. They &s;oon departed, and we being fore-warned, put our&s;elves in the be&s;t po&s;ture for defence; knowing that our in|tended
<PB N="20" REF="038422_0015_1011E97454FC92E8">
robbers were not prepared with fire arms&mdash;hav|ing nothing wherewith to make the a&s;&s;ault, excepting axes made of flint &s;tone, fixed in the end of a &s;plit &s;tick; the&s;e axes were their principal weapons for war; we having fire arms, ammunition and tomahawks in plen|ty, did not fear them, be their number ever &s;o large. However, we put our&s;elves in the be&s;t po&s;ture for de|fence, and kept a good look out through the night. Ju&s;t before the dawn of day (it being very calm weather) we could hear their paddles &s;trike the water; and they &s;oon came in &s;ight. I counted forty-two canoes&mdash; the &s;malle&s;t number in a canoe was fourteen, and in &s;ome were more than twenty. We permitted them to advance till they came near the &s;hore, and then fired upon them, which made terrible havoc. They being unacquainted with fire arms, were put into the greate&s;t confu&s;ion&mdash;&s;ome crawled to the &s;hore, others jumped into the water, and attempted to &s;ave them&s;elves by &s;wiming&mdash;a &s;mall number e&s;caped. Forty of them we took alive, and killed all except ten, who were re&s;erved for future diver&s;ion. After the battle was over, we counted among the dead on &s;hore, and in the water, two hundred and fifty, without any lo&s;s on our &s;ide. Soon after, the forenoon of that day, &s;everal of them were mo&s;t inhumanly &s;laughtered by the toma|hawk and knife, cutting open their bodies, and with their hands &s;cooping up the warm blood out of their bodies, while alive, and drinking it greedily,
<PB N="21" REF="038422_0016_1011E977C44F1A88">
whooping and dancing merrily, as if partaking of the mo&s;t agreeable repa&s;t. Some of our Indians ob&s;erving my backwardne&s;s to join them, ordered me to do as they did&mdash;with which I was obliged to comply &s;o far, as to &s;coop up blood into my hands, and daubed it over my mouth and face, to make them believe I drank it; they then &s;aid I was good man.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners who &s;urvived, were kept confined without any &s;u&s;tenance, and every day were whipt and tortured, by burning their fingers; forcing them into their pipes, when &s;moaking, and there confining them, until burnt to the bone; whooping and dancing round them&mdash;this was their practice day by day, until this &s;cene changed, by a &s;cene more horrible, which cannot be realized by my readers; nothing but occular dem|on&s;tration can bring this to a proper point of view, to this day, (a recollection of the &s;cene) it being tran&s;acted before my eyes, at a period of life, when the &s;malle&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t make a la&s;ting continuance&mdash;even now, makes me to &s;hudder.

<P>The pri&s;oner, de&s;tined for each day's diver&s;ion, was led from among his companions to the place of execu|tion, bound with &s;trong cords, (prepared from &s;inews of wild animals,) to a po&s;t fixed in the ground, to which the victim is &s;trongly tied, having his hands fa&s;|tened behind him, his back towards the po&s;t, and in &s;uch

a manner, that he could &s;tep round from &s;ide to &s;ide, keeping his back towards the fixed po&s;t. At a &s;mall di&s;tance, in a circular form round the unhappy &s;ufferer, fire was then kindled, con&s;i&s;ting of pitch pine &s;plinters, with other combu&s;tible matter, &s;o as to make a &s;mall, but con&s;tant fire. As &s;oon as the man feels the heat, he moves with a view to fly from the fire; but alas&punc; 'tis fruitle&s;s, for turn which way he will, he &s;till feels the force of the increa&s;ing element&mdash;our Indians then &s;hew their joy, by whooping, dancing, rattling their kettles, prepared for this purpo&s;e, by putting &s;mall &s;tones and bullets into them.

<P>From this i&s;land we departed, and paddled half a day, &s;teering &s;outh, till we &s;truck the &s;outh &s;hore of Red River; we hauled our canoes out of the river, and trav|elled fifteen miles, ob&s;erving a &s;outherly cour&s;e, carrying our canoes, &amp;c. over mountains, valleys and rocks, un|til we came to the river, called Rontooroo; we in our canoes following this river (which appear'd narrow on our fir&s;t entrance) forty-five miles&mdash;here the river is nine miles from &s;hore to &s;hore.

They appeared in the form of a Cone, circular, broad at the bottom, and gradually falling in at the top, which ended in a &s;mall point, with a hole in the centre, to carry off &s;moke, &amp;c. The wigwams appeared nearly of equal height, which
<PB N="24" REF="038422_0019_1011E9802FC2AF40">
was about twenty feet. I was much &s;tartled at the &s;ight, thinking that we &s;hould &s;oon engage our ene|mies, and a horr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> &s;cene of war would en&s;ue. I a&s;k|ed an Indian what that appearance before us meant? A Squaw came to me and told me not to be frightened. On our nearer approach to the &s;hore, I di&s;covered a number of flags-hoi&s;ted; &s;ome appeared very broad, and long, and of various colours, whereon were drawn figures of animals of different kinds, and neatly execu|ted. The inhabitants, of all ages, and &s;exes, ran towards the &s;hore, whooping and dancing with great vehemence, at which I was terrified to that degree, that I fainted, expecting &s;oon to be devoured by them. A number of Squaws came to me, threw water in my face, and tick|led the bottoms of my feet, &s;ides, and belly. I &s;oon re|vived, and we landed. The people on &s;hore hauled our canoes out of the water, and took care of our baggage, &amp;c; all which, they carried from the water's edge, to different wigwams, in a manner, before to me unknown, which was by placing them at arms length over their heads, whooping extravagantly as they pa&s;&s;ed along. On our coming to the centre of the wigwams, in an open &s;pace, large fires were kindled, over which were hung on poles, a number of large bra&s;s kettles, contain|ing indian corn, and meat of different kinds. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the fire, a large number of wood|en di&s;hes were piled up bottom upwards. At this place, preparation was made for a fea&s;t, prepared for

A large bone falling to my &s;hare, I took it from my di&s;h, and with a &s;tone, tried to break it in order to &s;uck the marrow out of it; at that time I did not fully comprehend the mode of regulating &s;o important a fea&s;t; one of the chiefs attentively viewing me, &s;aw my tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, immediately &s;prung from his &s;eat, and with an open knife in his hand, made directly towards me; I was much alarmed, and &s;tarting from my &s;eat on the ground, ran, the Indian &s;oon overtook me, and with an apparent de&s;ign to take my life, caught hold of my arm; I made all the re&s;i&s;tance in my power, by &s;cratching, biting, and kicking him, but all to no purpo&s;e; for he forced me back to my &s;eat, and bid me eat all in my di&s;h, and that I mu&s;t not crack a bone; he then retired to his &s;eat.

<P>As the &s;tem con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even joints, &s;even Indians were alternately called to tho&s;e la&s;t fixed blocks; the great pipe being lighted, the fir&s;t &s;even came forward, one after the other, &s;itting down, and drawing three whiffs a piece, withdrew. This continued &s;even at a time, coming on and going off, in the &s;ame manner, until the whole a&s;&s;embled multitude, went through this ceremony. This was their method of renewing and confirming their covenants on all great occa&s;ions, to &s;trengthen and unite their nation in a &s;trict adherence to their laws, thereby to regulate their proceedings in war, defen&s;ive or offen&s;ive, in peaceful covenants with other tribes, on the &s;afe return of long ab&s;ent friends, at marriages, &amp;c.

<P>My reader will naturally con&s;ider me as now about to encounter many new, and apparently in&s;urmountable trials. Being far removed, not le&s;s (as I conceive) than 15 or 16 hundred miles from my native country, nev|er more to enjoy dome&s;tic peace, which is and has been the happy lot of many, among their friends; no more to enjoy the fraternal embrace of the kinde&s;t and ten|dere&s;t of fathers; deprived of &s;weet interviews with the be&s;t of brothers, and two mo&s;t de&s;irable &s;i&s;ters; add to all this, a total deprivation of even the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;|pect of a tolerable education in my own country, and native language. My education at the time of my be|ing given to the Indians, was, as it were, but in embrio.

blunders, merely for want of a thorough knowl|edge of their language; add to this the di&s;agreeable manner of preparing and eating their food; their man|ner of &s;leeping; their frequent Indian yellings, all con|tributed more or le&s;s to inhance my lonely feelings. However, I &s;oon found that my lamentations would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o no purpo&s;e; I put on as manly a countenance, and ac|tions as po&s;&s;ible, trying to recommend my&s;elf to their fa|vourable notice.

and I &s;oon became acquainted with, and followed them for awhile in their diver&s;ions. One day in my walk with my comrades, I ob&s;erved a building of a different form, from any I had &s;een on this i&s;land. I was informed that this building was &s;ome years before, built by a Spaniard to carry on the gun-&s;mith's bu&s;ine&s;s, who had accumulated great wealth, con&s;i&s;ting of furs, &amp;c&mdash;our Indians envying him&mdash;killed him. I with my friends, entered this hou&s;e, which was built with &s;quare tim|ber, confined at each end, in the &s;ame manner as log hou&s;es are built in this country; here we found vari|ous tools, &s;ufficient to carry on the black-&s;mith's, gun-&s;mith's, and &s;ilver-&s;mith's bu&s;ine&s;s; a thought &s;truck my mind, that an opportunity now pre&s;ented for me to advance my&s;elf in property and friend&s;hip with my new friends. I learnt that the Indians did not make any u&s;e of this building nor tools; I &s;oon obtained liberty to improve them as my own.

The animals rou&s;ed and put in motion from different quarters, are by their drivers collected into one general company, which is done without much trouble, as they naturally herd together&mdash;the hunters &s;catter as much as they can, but not &s;o far as to pre|vent the game from retreat in the rear; thus drove on, they enter the opening, as above de&s;cribed. The ani|mals now enclo&s;ed, the men forming the northern part of the line join, the hunters clo&s;e up towards the &s;outh|ern part of the inclo&s;ure&mdash;the herd finding no e&s;cape on the quarter forming the hedge fence, fly to the o|ther quarter, from which they are &s;oon driven by the living fence, formed as above de&s;cribed; all things now prepared, a number of the mo&s;t expert hunters en|ter among the animals, which generally con&s;i&s;t of a ve|ry large number of old and young, fat and lean. The fate&s;t and be&s;t are prefered, leaving the poor and young|e&s;t for future &s;upplies. Having killed as many as we

cho&s;e, the remainder we &s;et at liberty. This hunt is performed in as &s;ecret a manner as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent the neighboring tribes from entering our borders, and &s;haring with us, in our diver&s;ion and profits. The Buffalos killed at this time, are brought together and dre&s;&s;ed, by &s;kinning and taking out their entrails&mdash;the meat is pre&s;erved by &s;moke, as is practiced by the In|dians, when de&s;irous of pre&s;erving their meat any length of time, which when &s;moked, is fit for u&s;e. The manner of &s;moking meat is thus, a long and narrow building, built by &s;etting up poles in the ground at equal di&s;tance one from the other, in two &s;trait lines, interwoven with &s;lim, pliable poles, covering over from &s;ide to &s;ide of the thus fixed poles with bark, they are completed, fit to receive the meat&mdash;this receiver is ea|&s;ily and &s;oon completed, as they are temporarily &s;et up wherever we meet a &s;ufficient quantity of meat worth &s;moking. The &s;kins taken from tho&s;e animals are dre&s;|&s;ed immediately, with the brains and marrow of the original owners, which when dre&s;&s;ed, leaving the hair on, are fit for trade with the northern tribes; with whom they are exchanged for moga&s;ons, &amp;c. The In|dians are careful to carry each man a &s;mall quantity of &s;alt, not to u&s;e with their meat, but as an antidote again&s;t the bite of rattle &s;nakes, which often happens, and to extract any other poi&s;on. Having &s;moked our meat, dre&s;&s;ed our &s;kins, &amp;c. we returned with our boo|ty to our dwellings, each one receiving his equal &s;hare.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="038422_0033_1011E9A44574D5D8">On my return, I went on with my bu&s;ine&s;s in my &s;hop as heretofore; &s;uch was the demand for toma|hawks, traps, &amp;c. that I now began to fix prices for my work, and told them I would not work any longer without pay, they &s;aid what mu&s;t we give you? I &s;aid, I want better clothes and more broaches; they then brought me the be&s;t blanket that could be found, ad|ding a large number of broaches of the be&s;t workman|&s;hip; al&s;o a very hand&s;ome gun, with the accoutre|ments fit for hunting, &amp;c. Thus encouraged, I &s;trove to plea&s;e them, which I happily effected in a &s;hort time; they frequently vi&s;ited me at my &s;hop, loading me with pre&s;ents of fur, gin&s;ang, and many other &s;maller matters.</P>
<P>This plea&s;ing &s;cene continued but for a &s;hort time, being interrupted by news, that a tribe not far di&s;tant, had encroached on our hunting ground. On this, a council of war was held, con&s;i&s;ting of the whole tribe, my&s;elf included, not one man mi&s;&s;ing. A &s;olemn con|&s;ultation was held, every man without di&s;tinction was allowed freely to give his opinion of the important que&s;tion. Shall we make war, and drive off the intru|ders? or &s;hall we allow them to enter our borders and hunt with impunity? they all appeared ready and wil|ling to make war with and drive from our lands the in&s;ulting foe.</P>
<P>I attentively li&s;tened to the debate, but was &s;o un|fortunate as to di&s;&s;ent from them in opinion. I well
<PB N="39" REF="038422_0034_1011E9A65530F510">
knew that my advice would be li&s;tened to, and be by them counted of much weight. I therefore with the importance of a councellor, demanded &s;ilence and at|tention to what I was about to &s;ay on the &s;ubject&mdash; they all, with &s;ilence, li&s;tening &s;at. This making war, &s;aid I, upon a &s;lender cau&s;e like unto the pre&s;ent, is not ju&s;tifiable, 'tis bad policy, we have no certain informa|tion, nothing but report, no one will &s;ay he &s;aw this in|tru&s;ion, and de&s;truction made on our hunting ground, 'tis but hear&s;ay report; my advice, therefore is, that &s;ome one tru&s;ty, mild (if any one can be found) mem|ber of our tribe be appointed, and properly authori&s;ed to go from this nation, to the Rahatoree Tribe, the &s;uppo&s;ed intruders, and there make proper enquiry in|to facts touching their conduct towards us; if they have intruded, and it is properly &s;ub&s;tantiated, let him immediately return, then we will adopt, and pur&s;ue the be&s;t mea&s;ures in our power for retalliation; if the report &s;hould prove groundle&s;s, let him go prepared further to &s;trengthen our friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>My advice was approved of by the whole council, and was immediately put in practice in the following manner. One of the number was cho&s;en and made ready agreeably to the pre&s;cribed method. The me&s;|&s;enger was dre&s;&s;ed in our u&s;ual mode&mdash;to make him re&s;pectable, he was ornamented with wampum, con&s;i&s;t|ing of beeds, belts, &amp;c; becoming one of &s;o much con|&s;equence;

he ha&s;tily proceeded on his journey&mdash;on his arrival made known his me&s;&s;age. By enquiring into their conduct, whether they had made any intru|&s;ion on the Scanyawtauragahrooote Tribe; the an|&s;wer was, that they had hunted on their lands, and that they would whenever they &s;aw fit; if our tribe di&s;liked it, they might take what mea&s;ures they thought be&s;t, to prevent it. Upon this our envoy &s;oon return|ed, and reported to proper per&s;ons of our nation, ap|pointed therefor. This report having been made pub|lic, the general cry was War! War! the whole tribe a&s;&s;embled, the national pipe, already de&s;cribed, was by &s;pecial order brought forward, and all who were inclin|ed to go on this expedition, were to &s;moke three whiffs a piece. The number who &s;moked on this occa&s;ion con&s;i&s;t|ed of five thou&s;and.

The place into which the Powow was placed, was prepared by fixing a number of flexible poles in the ground, thus, one end drove down, bending over, the other end fixed into the ground, forming an arch, and &s;o on, as to form a &s;pace &s;uffi|cient to contain one per&s;on only&mdash;the &s;paces between the&s;e poles were filled up with interweavings of bark, rine and twigs, &s;o clo&s;ely as not to admit light; each

end was al&s;o &s;ecured, &s;o clo&s;e as to exclude the lea&s;t ray. In this di&s;mal place the juggler was placed, confined on his back with ligatures, cro&s;&s;ways and lengthways of his body, in &s;uch a manner, as to pre|vent motion in any one member, except his head. He being thus confined, a number of Indians came for|ward, and formed a circle round him, &s;etting on the ground cro&s;s legged, with blankets covered over their heads, ob&s;erving a profound &s;ilence&mdash;in a &s;hort time the Powow begins to mutter in a low voice, which ri&s;es in a language new and &s;trange, for a long time, then a noi&s;e is heard like a ru&s;hing wind, ringing of bells, &amp;c; in about fifteen minutes, the pri&s;oner is in|vincibly relea&s;ed, and runs violently to the water, fol|lowed by his cro&s;s legged brethren, and there contin|ues &s;o long as to dive three times, thence ru&s;hing from the water ran to his former retreat, there lay without &s;peaking, not eating or drinking for twenty-four hours, then eats and drinks plentifully; after which, informs the gaping multitude that the expedition &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful, that but nine hundred men would oppo&s;e them. Upon this agreeable information, our i&s;land rang with whooping and dancing, rejoicing and boa&s;ting at the advantage they had of five thou&s;and oppo&s;ing nine hundred. Orders were then given, that all tho&s;e who had &s;moked the great pipe, &s;hould immediately prepare to march, which began by painting their faces in the following manner: the right

&s;ide red with half the no&s;e, the left &s;ide of the face and no&s;e black, the top of the head, which is without hair, of different colours chequer-wi&s;e, all which denote courage without fear. Each man fixed on his warlike weapons, and were ready&mdash;the preparation took up but two days.</P>
<P>With twenty canoes we left our i&s;land, cautiou&s;ly paddled to the main. On &s;triking the &s;hore, we hauled up our canoes, and carried them on our backs, crept through the bu&s;hes &s;ome miles, until we came to a great lake; on an i&s;land in this lake, our enemies dwelt. We, without noi&s;e, put our canoes into the wa|ter, and paddled within a few rods of the i&s;land; here we made a halt, and di&s;patched a &s;mall number to re|connoitre the i&s;land&mdash;of this party I was one&mdash;(here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that our canoes were of various &s;izes, &s;ome would carry twenty-&s;ix or thirty men; the large&s;t &s;ix men could carry with ea&s;e.) On our near approach, we &s;aw a number paddling round the i&s;land, as if to keep a good look out, for they expected us; we &s;oon returned to our party, and informed what we had &s;een; upon this, our whole body cautiou&s;ly moved on, it being dark, as we came near, keeping a profound &s;ilence&mdash;our ene|mies' arrows whi&s;tled about our ears; we could per|ceive them in quick motion, and &s;ilent&mdash;they had much the advantage among the bu&s;hes, and we in open &s;ight, and before we recovered the &s;hore, they killed 25 of

our number, three of their arrows &s;tuck into my cap, I being in one of the foremo&s;t canoes. The night being calm, we &s;oon went on &s;hore, and pur&s;ued the enemy in all directions&mdash;the i&s;land being &s;mall, we &s;oon found their lurking places, and de&s;troyed many. As &s;oon as day light appeared, here a dreadful carnage en&s;ued, accompanied with &s;avage yelling, which &s;erved but to increa&s;e &s;avage fury. Our enemies finding our number much exceeded theirs they endeavoured to make off; &s;ome by &s;wimming from the i&s;land, &s;ome took to their canoes, but we prevented them, by clo&s;ely pur&s;uing and knocking them in head, &s;ome we &s;hot in the water; &s;ome who had reached their canoes, we al&s;o &s;hot. This carnage went on with increa&s;ing fury, until nearly all of them were killed, or taken alive; a &s;mall number however, reached the oppo&s;ite &s;hore;&mdash;their canoes al|&s;o fell chiefly into our hands; many we &s;tove in pieces, others we kept for our own u&s;e. Among the pri&s;oners, we culled fifty of the talle&s;t and be&s;t men, to carry our &s;poils, &amp;c. to our i&s;land, we al&s;o re&s;erved one boy, the others we took, were directly killed in a mo&s;t &s;avage and brutal manner. Thus in about twenty-four hours after landing, we killed and took the whole number of the enemy, con&s;i&s;ting of five hundred. Upon examining our party, we mi&s;&s;ed ninety-two of our number, includ|ing tho&s;e killed on our landing.</P>
<P>This i&s;land being now in peace, with our pri&s;oners and &s;poil, we left it, and without any material hind|rance
<PB N="44" REF="038422_0039_1011E9B45B1CEB00">
we arrived at our i&s;land. On our &s;afe return, we were received with the u&s;ual ceremonies, performed on &s;imilar occa&s;ions of conque&s;t, as has been already related. After a &s;hort refre&s;hment, a council was held, to determine in what mode to execute the pri&s;oners; the re&s;ult was, to bring them out the next morning, and in the mo&s;t public manner proceed as follows: &s;ixteen &s;takes fixed into the ground, at about fifty feet one from the other; at each &s;take one pri&s;oner was tied his face towards the &s;take, his hind parts ex|po&s;ed to the per&s;ecutors; then a large number of &s;quaws appeared, every one armed with a club of three feet in length, and four inches in circumference. Round each unhappy &s;ufferer, a &s;trong guard is placed, to pre|vent any &s;quaw from liberating a pri&s;oner, which &s;ome|times happen without this precaution;&mdash; this done, the &s;quaws march in a &s;ingle file, giving every pri&s;oner one blow on his naked back; when they came to the boy, the &s;quaws unitedly begged his life, which by the Indian Chiefs was granted, and given to me, who afterwards became &s;ingularly u&s;eful, and tarried with me during my &s;tay with the Indians; after the &s;quaws had per|formed their part, then an equal number of boys, each one with his pipe filled with tobacco and fire, went up, thru&s;ting the &s;ufferers' fingers into the pipe, when hot, confining them until the finger was bli&s;tered; then a number of other boys came on, and with blunt arrows, &s;hot at them, never mi&s;&s;ing the mark&mdash;this continued
<PB N="45" REF="038422_0040_1011E9B702173B88">
for three days. The pri&s;oners were kept in the &s;ame po&s;ition, without any &s;u&s;tenance during the whole tran&s;action, all which they bore without any &s;eeming reluctance, although irritated with reflections on their pa&s;t conduct, as cowards, and of unequal &s;trength to oppo&s;e our tribe, and by bringing food before them, and frequently put to their mouths, of which they were forbid to ta&s;te. At the expiration of the third day, their bodies appeared one general wound; then dry wood was brought and piled around each vic|tim, and &s;et on fire at each corner; when en&s;ued dan|cing, &amp;c. round the con&s;uming pile, in the &s;ame man|ner as hath already been related on &s;imilar occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>This more than brutal &s;cene being fini&s;hed, which took up &s;ome days, the tormentors and other &s;pectators went each one to his wigwam, I to my &s;hop, with my boy, whom I con&s;idered as my apprentice. My bu&s;ine&s;s daily increa&s;ing, and cu&s;tomers punctual in payment, gave me peculiar plea&s;ure, &s;o that I almo&s;t forgot my former mode of living, and &s;weets of a relative life; frequently diverting my&s;elf by fi&s;hing, and hunt|ing near home.</P>
<P>The di&s;advantage I had laboured under, during my peregrination, rendered it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to keep a true Kalendar; my reader, therefore, mu&s;t not expect an exact account of the times, in which the &s;everal tran&s;|actions
<PB N="46" REF="038422_0041_1011E9BA8CBDA090">
took place, as mentioned in this detail, although perfectly true.</P>
<P>And now about this time, another tramp to Tartar|rac was planned, and preparation was accordingly made, by collecting together our fur, gin&s;ang, &amp;c. Thus prepared, we &s;et off in our canoes, and frequent|ly put on &s;hore on either &s;ide of the river, to catch Wild Turkeys, and other &s;mall game. One day as I was travelling through &s;ome woods near the river, I e&s;|pied a Monkey, and &s;oon caught him, and carried him in my canoe to Tartarrac here we arrived in the u&s;u|al time &s;pent in paddling do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to the city&mdash;on our being admitted, we began ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. I took my Monkey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They live on nuts and other vegetables, &s;pontaneou&s;ly growing in the woods.</NOTE> under my arm, travelled through &s;everal &s;treets trying to &s;ell him; at length I &s;aw a boy &s;tandng near an ele|gant hou&s;e, I a&s;ked him in Indian language, if he would buy my Monkey? he an&s;wered, his ma&s;ter was gone from home, but if I would &s;top he would go up &s;tairs and a&s;k his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;he then took a key from his pocket, ran up &s;tairs, &s;oon returned and a&s;ked my price? I &s;aid, three dollars&mdash;he took my Monkey, car|ried it to his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;returned, and in lieu of my Pug, gave me my price; I was then invited to eat, which I gladly accepted. While I was eating, the ma&s;ter re|turned,
<PB N="47" REF="038422_0042_1011E9BC75D2EA58">
and immediately went up &s;tairs to his lady, &s;ee|ing a Monkey in her lap, enquired how &s;he procured him? &s;he an&s;wered, a young Indian left it with her&mdash;he a&s;ked if it might be bought? &s;he an&s;wered, the owner is below. He immediately came down to me, and a&s;k|ed if I owned the Monkey? if I would &s;ell him? I re|plied yes, will take what you plea&s;e to give, (for I found he knew nothing of my trade with his wife.) After I had eat and drank &s;ufficiently, he a&s;ked me to go with him to his &s;tore? I followed him, and he gave me two dollars in money, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ree dollars in ar|ticles I wanted, and found there. Now the Monkey is his, the money and &s;uch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">les <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he gave are mine.</P>
<P>In &s;taring round the &s;tore, I &s;aw a number of odly form'd things, appearing &s;omething like cro&s;s belts, locked together with padlocks; the boy being pre&s;ent, the merchant left the &s;tore&mdash;I having an itching de&s;ire to know the exact form, and u&s;e of them, I took up one in my hand, viewing it attentively, I found &s;ome part lined and &s;tuffed with wool; I a&s;ked the boy, (who could conver&s;e in our language) what it was? and of what u&s;e? he told me that the Spaniards were jeal|ous of their wives, and to prevent an unlawful inter|cour&s;e with other men, this in&s;trument was contrived, and always by the hu&s;band put on and locked round his wife, in &s;uch a manner, as to prevent any immode&s;t connections between different &s;exes&mdash;this the hu&s;band
<PB N="48" REF="038422_0043_1011E9BF014276C8">
never neglected, when about to leave his wife, even but for a &s;hort time. That was the invariable practice, as the boy told me with his ma&s;ter, which accounts for the boy's taking a key from his pocket, and going up &s;tairs, when I offered to &s;ell him my Monkey; for the hu&s;band never leaves his hou&s;e, until his wife is prop|erly equiped, and locked up in her chamber, the key of which, and of the padlock, is delivered to the maid or boy of the family, who keeps them until the re|turn of the hu&s;band, and to him only, are the keys de|livered.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such is the jealou&s;y of the Tartarrac Spaniard, that if a hu&s;band finds his wife conver&s;ing with any other man, it often proves fatal to one or both.</NOTE></P>
<P>I left the &s;tore and joined my brethren, to whom I communicated my good luck. We went on with our trade tolerably well, in purcha&s;ing &s;ome iron, &s;teel, led and powder, with many other nece&s;&s;ary articles, all which I carefully &s;towed in our canoes&mdash;the manage|ment of our trade, &amp;c. devolving principally on me. Having now brought the Indians into &s;uch &s;ubjection, that I could &s;ay to one come, and he came, to another go, and he went.</P>
<P>We tarried four days only, at this time in Tartar|rac. The fourth and la&s;t day, our Indians began to
<PB N="49" REF="038422_0044_1011E9C1AD18E048">
break over the orders, and drank too freely&mdash;the &s;uc|ceeding night became a &s;cene of horror and blood&s;hed. I had as much as I could do, to keep them from de&s;|troying one another&mdash;by my exertion, the greater part of their weapons were kept from them; however, one young Indian found means to procure a tomahawk, and did much mi&s;chief, before I had knowledge of it. An old &s;quaw came running to me, and inform'd that two of them, father and &s;on, had engaged. I &s;prung for|ward, catched a club, ran to them, ordered the &s;on im|mediately to give up his weapon; which he, knowing my voice, gave to me&mdash;turning my&s;elf from them, they made a mo&s;t hideous yell&mdash;I turned, and found the &s;on had got his father by his head, which he &s;udden|ly pulled down, and again&s;t his up-lifted knee, broke his father's neck. The &s;on immediately ab&s;conded, and has never been &s;een with us &s;ince. No other death happened through the night. The force of the liquor having abated, a new &s;cene <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow took place as follows: The whole number &s;eated them&s;elves in companies on the ground, cro&s;slegged; each one throwing his blan|ket over his head&mdash;all &s;eated in a circular form, a hid|eous yelling commenced; each one lamenting his own misfortunes, the lo&s;s of his grand father, his father, and other friends. This continued for &s;ome hours, after which, we prepared to return.</P>
<P>My vi&s;its to Tartarrac, to me were very agreeable, having an opportunity of conver&s;ing with people who
<PB N="50" REF="038422_0045_1011E9C4694162D8">
conducted much as the people of Canada. Their bread I was much plea&s;ed with.</P>
<P>Our bu&s;ine&s;s being conducted much as heretofore, we took to our canoes, and in the u&s;ual time returned to our friends. On my return, I and my boy went on with our bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;our Indians employed in their &s;eve|ral diver&s;ions, for the men never perform any manual labour, except making in&s;truments for war. The &s;quaws always perform the harve&s;t work, &s;uch as to plant and dre&s;s the corn, bring from the woods &s;uch game as the hunters from time to time recover.</P>
<P>In about &s;ix months after our return, &s;ome of our warriors formed a plan to rob a di&s;tant nation of their furs, &amp;c. (for they continue peaceable but for a &s;hort time together.) This nation was called the White In|dian, and lived about three hundred miles north. Five hundred of the &s;prie&s;t and mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing of our Indians, of whom I was counted one, went through the ceremonies u&s;ually practi&s;ed on like occa&s;ions, &s;et out on the propo&s;ed robbery, without any provi&s;ion, de|pending wholly on hunting for a &s;upply.</P>
<P>We marched with proper guides for three weeks. Coming near to the place of de&s;tination, we made a halt, and con&s;ulted the be&s;t method to fall upon them. 'Twas agreed that a number &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e,
<PB N="51" REF="038422_0046_1011E9C7D1B43230">
(for they were a harmle&s;s, defencele&s;s people) &s;hould divide them&s;elves into &s;mall companies of two each&mdash; every company take a different rout in a circuitous march round the mountain.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They dug into a mountain, and &s;ecreted them&s;elves and property in caves.</NOTE> My companion, with whom I travelled, took orders and departed, both car|rying fire arms and ammunition, with a &s;trict charge to return at a certain time, as had been agreed on, whether &s;ucce&s;sful or not.</P>
<P>We travelled five days, without making any di&s;cov|ery; at length, on the &s;ixth day, as we were chatting together, my friend e&s;pied a man &s;tanding naked, with a bow in his hand, at the entrance of a cave&mdash;I ran to him, and with my tomahawk di&s;patched him&mdash;he did not &s;hoot, although armed with bow and arrow. The way being prepared for our entrance into the cavern in &s;earch for plunder, a di&s;pute aro&s;e between us, who &s;hould enter fir&s;t; we at length determined by ca&s;ting lots, and the lot fell on me.

moving on for &s;ome con&s;iderable length, we were &s;topt by a &s;hort turn to the right; from thence creeping forward with as much &s;ilence as po&s;&s;ible, I found ano|ther turn to the left; in this cour&s;e we &s;teered for &s;ome time, at length I di&s;covered by the light of my torch, a large opening, apparently of about fifteen or twenty feet &s;quare. In this opening we di&s;covered a number moving about. I then began to reali&s;e my &s;ituation, to be more critical than ever before or &s;ince&mdash;no re|treat, for we could not turn to get out, our enemies before us, and we knew not in what manner they were prepared to receive us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This cave, into which we entered, for the reader's better under&s;tanding, I will de&s;cribe. The entrance is ju&s;t wide e|nough to admit one per&s;on at a time, gradually de&s;cending a few feet, arched over with timber, then on a level until we come to the turns, then through to the next as above, and &s;o on to the opening, in which we found the people&mdash;this opening was arched at its top with large beams of cedar, &amp;c.</NOTE> On our nearer approach, we rai&s;ed our voices into yelling and whooping, in order to intimidate them, and prevent their making any de|fence&mdash;this &s;ucceeded, and prevented their making the lea&s;t defence.

to kill all we &s;hould find within. The executioner per|formed his part, by killing the whole with his toma|hawk. Tho&s;e per&s;ons appeared quite different from any I had ever before &s;een.</P>
<P>The adults appeared about five feet high, very large, round heads, flat no&s;es, wide mouths, very large and white teeth, very long, &s;trait and very white hair, pale countenance, having no occa&s;ion to ramble abroad, ex|cept to hunt for food and bedding; a &s;mall portion of each &s;erving them&mdash;they are &s;trangers to fire and cloth|ing, living a mo&s;t indolent life. We found no kind of tool with them, excepting one made &s;omething like a hatchet, having a &s;tone made flat at one end, and fa&s;|tened into a &s;tick &s;plit at one end. The bottom of the cavern was covered over with &s;kins, piled up one on a|nother, to a con&s;iderable height, con&s;i&s;ting of Buffalo, Bear, Fox and of almo&s;t every &s;pecies of animals, common to that part of the country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their manner of catching their game, is by diging pits in the ground, &s;lightly covering them with &s;ome &s;mall twigs cov|ered over with leaves, into which the animal falls, and is ea&s;ily taken.</NOTE> In one corner of this room, we found a quantity of meat, &s;tinking horribly; this appeared to be their only food; howev|er, we were obliged to feed on &s;ome through nece&s;&s;ity.

Raccoon, and at the mouth of the cave, loaded our|&s;elves with as much &s;poil as we could &s;tand under, and as expeditious as po&s;&s;ible, travelled on to our head quarters, where we found our &s;everal companions, who had as before de&s;cribed, performed their &s;everal routs; they were &s;ucce&s;sful, and joined the main body, loaded with like plunder. Hereupon a general &s;hout took place with claping of hands, &amp;c. being much plea&s;ed with our good luck. The whole company freely par|took of &s;uch fare, as our friends had in our ab&s;ence (which was nine days from the time of our departure) prepared&mdash;the whole body, each one taking his propor|tional &s;hare of baggage, began our retreat homewards.</P>
<P>During our march from a neighbouring pond, we heard noi&s;es, as of many water fowls, which we conclu|ded had collected in the pond. We were much elated at this, having a keen appetite for fowl; a number were &s;ent off to &s;earch the pond, my&s;elf mak|ing one, we &s;oon reached it; but to our &s;urprize found the fowl had (confiding in their tru&s;ty wings) left the water&mdash;ca&s;ting our eyes over the pond, we di&s;covered a very large white Bear diving frequently, as if for fi&s;h&mdash; he at length fixed him&s;elf on a large flat rock on one &s;ide, looking into the water, &s;triking his fore paw, as though catching fi&s;h, at every &s;troke lifting up his paw, as if to &s;ee its contents&mdash;I being eager, fired from the &s;hore at the Bear, but without effect; my ball as I

could plainly &s;ee &s;truck his &s;ide, his hair being very thick and long, prevented my killing him; on which, an experienced gunner &s;teped up, ob&s;erving his rai&s;ed paw, aimed at the &s;pace between the under &s;ide of the paw and body, &s;hot and killed him in&s;tantly. This was a lucky event; we &s;oon drew him from the water&mdash; which in &s;ome mea&s;ure made up for our di&s;appoint|ment in the water fowls. We dre&s;&s;ed our game, and with it joined our brethren, the main body, and &s;oon renewed our march homewards, which we in three weeks performed.</P>
<P>After making an equal di&s;tribution of plunder, each one retired to his home and employment. Our great men now began to think it high time to honor me with the In&s;ignia of their tribe, and to give me a new and ma|je&s;tic name, having in many excur&s;ions witne&s;&s;ed my valor. I dreaded the operation; however, was obli|ged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>The mark by which the Tribe I belonged to was di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others, was that of the &s;un on the in&s;ide of the right leg, and of the moon and &s;even &s;tars on the out&s;ide of the &s;ame leg. This was performed on me by pricking with a &s;harp needle into my right leg, the various pre&s;cribed forms, in red and blue colours. Having marked my leg, they proceeded to mark my face, which I much oppo&s;ed, determined not to con|&s;ent
<PB N="56" REF="038422_0051_1011E9D5F3E20738">
&mdash;I therefore &s;truggled, and endeavoured to e&s;cape by biting, kicking, &amp;c; they however went on and &s;lightly marked my face&mdash;they proceeded to pluck my hair from my head, excepting a &s;mall part on the back the bigne&s;s of my hand&mdash;they proceeded to dre&s;s me; at this I made no further oppo&s;ition, not willing to lo&s;e the good opinion my friends had formed of me, which by this time, became of no &s;mall con&s;equence to me. They painted my head in chequers of different colours; then fixed a gold ring in my no&s;e, &s;ilver drops to my ears; then fa&s;tened a &s;trap to my lock of hair behind, which reached to the ground, filled with broach|es from top to bottom; then tied a &s;tring of beads of various colours round my neck, inter&s;per&s;ed with differ|ent coloured feathers, all fixed into a leather collar of curious workman&s;hip; a leather &s;trap ornamented as above was thrown over my &s;houlders, at each end were fixed two &s;ilver plates with engravings; on one, the form of a Buffalo, on the other, that of a Panther; to this they added the be&s;t blanket the Tribe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, ornamented with five hundred broaches; my &s;hirt a gay calico; my bu&s;kins red, mogga&s;ons yellow, orna|mented with beads and feathers of many colours, tied together with party coloured ribbands, two Peacock feathers &s;tuck into my lock of hair, completed my dre&s;s &mdash;then proceeded the formality of giving me &s;ome great name; the greate&s;t and mo&s;t learned were con|&s;ulted on this occa&s;ion. After a long con&s;ultation,
<PB N="57" REF="038422_0052_1011E9D8BAFE14D0">
'twas agreed on, and a Chief who&s;e office it was, &s;tep|ped up to me, and in a loud voice proclaimed my name, Rooo&s;tontee Cowawoo.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Signifying great, maje&s;tic, acquired by great and war|like deeds, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>After this ceremony clo&s;ed, I retired to my &s;hop, and with my apprentice, carried on my bu&s;ine&s;s; the Indians frequenting it as u&s;ual; at all times coming in, and with deference and re&s;pect, approached me, knowing my important &s;tation. Thus inve&s;ted with the highe&s;t honor, they could confer on me, I reali&s;ed my importance and power, and &s;oon began a reform among them&mdash;all my in&s;tructions were attentively o|beyed. In this way I went on for &s;ome length of time; receiving and making congratulatory vi&s;its from, and to my neighbours.</P>
<P>Some time after, one of my familiar acquaintance propo&s;ed a &s;hort hunt for &s;mall game. I readily con|&s;ented, and we two &s;et off, prepared with traps, guns and ammunition.</P>
<P>After travelling five days, we came to an exten&s;ive plain, totally dive&s;ted of any kind of vegetable, and nothing but &s;and, dry and light; which on a gentle breeze of wind is put in motion&mdash;&s;ometimes the wind when rai&s;ed to a high degree, and blowing one way for

any con&s;iderable time, puts the &s;and into a quick and violent motion, and rolls it up into the appearance of waves, forming deep troughs between each roll or wave; whenever this happens, no one can pa&s;s over this track|le&s;s wa&s;te. Soon after our coming to this place, &s;ud|denly a &s;trong wind from the north aro&s;e, and formed the &s;urface of this plain, into the appearance as ju&s;t re|lated. Near by we were obliged to camp, and tarried four days, until the &s;torm abated. Our tarry here, was attended with difficulty, not having a &s;ufficiency of food, and no opportunity of &s;upply pre&s;ented, we were reduced to the la&s;t mor&s;el. In our feeble &s;tate, (a calm &s;ea&s;on,) we attempted to cro&s;s over this, apparently, im|pa&s;&s;able heath. On our way we found two human bo|dies almo&s;t petrified by the heat of the &s;un, and warm &s;and, which through the whole, retained &s;uch a degree of heat as to bli&s;ter our feet.</P>
<P>During our, encampment and travel over the &s;and, our guides (which were the &s;un by day, and moon and &s;tars by night) for&s;ook us, being cloudy the whole time. On examining our &s;tores, we found but one pound of &s;moaked Buffalo for us both. We marched on northerly, towards our village; having the &s;un for our guide, (it now plea&s;antly appearing.)</P>
<P>After four days travel from the &s;and, we came to a &s;pacious meadow; here I failed for want of food, &s;at

down, and expected here to end my days; but my companion kept up his courage, and travelling a &s;mall di&s;tance from me, e&s;pied a Deer laying down behind a windfall&mdash;he ran back to me, and told me he had found good meat. He &s;oon killed the Deer, and opening his body, devoured in a naked &s;tate the entrails; this I could not partake of. My friend chopped up &s;ome meat and made broth, which I greedily &s;wallowed, which was the mo&s;t delicious mor&s;el I ever ta&s;ted, hav|ing for &s;ome days before received no kind of nouri&s;h|ment, except our leather belts cut up and &s;oaked in water.</P>
<P>One night, &s;oon after laying down to &s;leep, we were rou&s;ed with a heavy &s;hower of rain, attended with tre|mendous thunder and &s;harp lightning&mdash;this further en|feebled me, having nothing to &s;creen me from the wea|ther. In this feeble &s;tate I continued &s;ome days&mdash; my companion fixed his traps in different parts of the mea|dow, baited with fle&s;h we had cut and prepared from the dead bodies we found in the &s;and&mdash;he caught many Beaver, &amp;c. During our tarry here, the weather pro|ved rainy and the &s;un beclouded, &s;o that we could not leave the &s;wamp, not knowing which way to &s;teer.</P>
<P>One day ju&s;t before &s;un &s;et, we happily di&s;covered our retreat from this di&s;mal &s;wamp, by the &s;un. We immediately improved this opportunity for e&s;cape by

bundling up our furs, &amp;c; and by the help of the moon decamped, &s;teering a north cour&s;e, and by morning hap|pily found our&s;elves quite out of the meadow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;wamp or meadow, was of forty miles extent, and pearly &s;quare, covered with flaggs and ru&s;hes to a great height &mdash;near the center, I lay in my feeble &s;tate.</NOTE>&mdash;we then lay down and &s;lept &s;oundly until noon&mdash;eat hear|tily of the veni&s;on my friend killed in the &s;wamp, &s;ome part we &s;moaked; here we tarried until the next day, in order to recruit and re&s;t our weary limbs. On our way home, each night we prepared and &s;et traps for Fox, Sable, Beaver and Mink; each morning we found that our traps caught more or le&s;s, &s;o that before we came to our homes we collected a very large quantity, in&s;o|much, that our bundles were too heavy for us to carry. We travelled on, and in a few days after came &s;afely to our friends; from whom we met a hearty welcome, which was &s;hown by claping of hands, whooping and dancing round us.</P>
<P>Soon after my return, I was &s;eized with a violent fever, of the pleuretic kind, which continued for a long time, and ended in a long intermitting fever. Here I reali&s;ed the comforts of the clo&s;e attention of a friend, who &s;tuck by me clo&s;er than a brother; I mean the aid of my adopted mother, the Indian &s;quaw before mentioned. She never left me, day nor night, during

my illne&s;s, which continued five months&mdash;her friendly hand admini&s;tered &s;uitable anodynes, prepared from &s;uitable herbs and roots, &s;pontaneou&s;ly growing in that country. She frequently would call in the neigh|bouring aged, and mo&s;t experienced &s;quaws,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;quaws with them, are their &s;urgeons and phy&s;icians.</NOTE> and with them, con&s;ult the be&s;t means of application, and how|ever difficult to recover, &s;pared no co&s;t nor pains to obtain and prepare them for my u&s;e.

<P>After my long and tedious confinement, I too &s;oon went abroad&mdash;my bu&s;ine&s;s urged me to work; I being the only black&s;mith in our Tribe, too re&s;olutely began to work, and thereby brought on a relap&s;e, which a|gain confined me to my wigwam, and a long, feeble &s;tate of health en&s;ued&mdash;I again had recour&s;e to my nur&s;e and doctor, my mother; &s;he attentively con&s;idered my ca&s;e, pronounced it de&s;perate, pa&s;t recovery, unle&s;s prevented by my &s;teady adherence to her pre&s;criptions; I promi&s;ed &s;trictly to obey, and cheerfully gave my&s;elf into her hands&mdash;&s;he undertook my cure, and &s;oon check|ed

my di&s;order, by giving me Buffalo's blood to drink lukewarm&mdash;I drank more or le&s;s every day, until my complaints were no more.</P>
<P>My &s;trength gradually increa&s;ing with my return|ing health, I &s;oon recovered; but before I entered on &s;hop bu&s;ine&s;s, I vi&s;ited our chiefs, with a view to carry on my propo&s;ed plan of reform among them; &s;etting forth the advantage, that the more civilized part of mankind enjoyed than they in their rude and uncul|tivated &s;tate. I began by informing them of the man|ner of my father's particular mode of family govern|ment, of conducting his dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s, &amp;c. &amp;c; to all which, they gave attention, and an&s;wered, by fir&s;t &s;haking their heads in di&s;approbation of my plan, then &s;neeringly would &s;ay, you tell a pretty good &s;tory, but ours is much better than yours, our nation greater and more ancient than yours&mdash;we live great while in the world, and know much more than your nation; our ways are preferable to yours, we will be Indian. I found my attempts were fruitle&s;s, therefore for the pre&s;ent dropt my plan, intending at &s;ome future time to pur&s;ue it, if a convenient opportunity &s;hould offer.</P>
<P>In a few days I went on with my bu&s;ine&s;s in my &s;hop, my boy continuing with me, who by this time became very helpful, having acquired a con&s;iderable in&s;ight into the bu&s;ine&s;s, which daily increa&s;ing, afford|ed
<PB N="63" REF="038422_0058_1011E9E769FC3EC8">
me much comfort and profit&mdash;our Indians con&s;tantly employing me in making their tomahawks, &s;calping knives, and traps; mending guns, and &s;ometimes mak|ing new gun-locks; all which, they were obliged to go to Tartarrac for, previous to my coming among them.</P>
<P>On delivering my work, I received my price in furs, gin&s;ang, &amp;c; carefully &s;toring them until an opportunity pre&s;ented to traffick at Tartarrac. My employers would frequently make me large pre&s;ents in addition to the &s;tipulated price for my work&mdash;the &s;quaws in particular, would make me many and val|uable ones, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ap-&s;ugar, annually made in February. Of this &s;ugar, I could collect on any &s;ud|den emergency, large quantities. The &s;quaws would enter my &s;hop with the &s;ugar wrapped up in the fore part of their blankets; on their coming near, they would drop a low courte&s;y, &s;aying, Rooo&s;tontee, me give you good &s;ugar; I with a nod of my head, thanked them, pointing to a large cabin in one corner of my &s;hop, bid them throw it up there, which they cheerful|ly did; turning to go out, they would drop a courte&s;y and go off.</P>
<P>I &s;teadily pur&s;ued my work, not without frequent vi&s;its from young Indians, my intimates. One day a number gathered, and began to banter one another,
<PB N="64" REF="038422_0059_1011E9EAC6B73148">
and braging of their &s;uperior abilities in jumping, wre&s;t|ling, &amp;c; one in particular offered to bet fifty broaches again&s;t an equal number that he could jump higher than any one pre&s;ent&mdash;upon this an intimate of mine took him up and propo&s;ed that I &s;hould jump with him; we jumped one after the other; all agreed to decide the wager in my favour. Upon examining my antago|ni&s;t, I found that he had no broaches with him; I re|&s;ented his conduct and told him he was a rogue in bantering the company, without having it in his power to pay his bet; he promi&s;ed to pay me &s;oon, but neglected.</P>
<P>One day he came into my &s;hop with a good blan|ket loaded with broaches, I catched his blanket from his back and tore off fifty broaches, and threw his blan|ket under my bellows; he crawled under them for his blanket, expo&s;ing his po&s;teriors; I &s;natched my rod from the fire, and whipped him &s;o as to bli&s;ter his back &s;ides, he yelled heartily, ran to the river and plunged in; this brought a number round me, ha&s;tily enquiring the cau&s;e of &s;o much noi&s;e; I told them my &s;tory, they all ju&s;tified me, and &s;o the matter blew over.</P>
<P>Some time after an Indian came to my &s;hop, and a&s;ked me to go with him to a neighbour's wigwam? I a&s;ked for what purpo&s;e? he informed me that an In|dian lately returned from Tartarrac had brought rum,
<PB N="65" REF="038422_0060_1011E9EDE6AB94F8">
and kept drunk for &s;ome time; that his &s;quaw could not find his rum. I went with my friend to the tipler's wigwam, and we found him almo&s;t in a lifele&s;s &s;tate. We &s;earched every place, likely for him to &s;ecreet his rum, but to no purpo&s;e; but as we came from the wig|wam, we found two &s;turgeon fi&s;h, which my friend attentively viewing, &s;uppo&s;ed the rum might be con|cealed within them&mdash;he ripped open the fi&s;h, and in each he found a bottle of rum, artfully concealed; this we &s;oon de&s;troyed, and left the wigwam and the drunkard&mdash;returned to my &s;hop and went on as u&s;ual&punc; I and my boy turning off work to advantage.</P>
<P>Soon after, as I and my boy lay in &s;ound &s;leep at midnight, I was rou&s;ed by a heavy voice from without, calling me by name, demanding entrance? I knew his voice,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The drunkard.</NOTE> and refu&s;ed to let him in; he per&s;i&s;ted, and &s;aid he would come in, &s;aying, I want to &s;peak with you very much; I bid him go home and come in the morning; he made every effort to force open my door, but not &s;ucceeding, he came to the window, and forced the &s;hutter open, di&s;charged his gun upon me&mdash;the ball entered the &s;ide of my &s;hop about &s;ix inches from my head, as I lay on my bed. This rou&s;ed me, and &s;pringing up, I caught my gun which &s;tood near me loaded with ball, (as was my practice always to keep my gun near

me at night, to defend my&s;elf again&s;t every intruder,) &s;tepped up to the window and &s;hot him, who dropt and died in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>The firing of two guns in the dead of night, cau&s;ed a general alarm through the village. A large number &s;oon collected, and under&s;tanding the cau&s;e, took and put me under keepers, to be brought forth in the morning for trial. I contentedly &s;ubmitted, knowing my cau&s;e to be good, having acted on the defen&s;ive only.</P>
<P>In the morning I was conducted to the place of trial, which was in the open air, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance from my &s;hop. On my coming near to the council of trial, a thought &s;truck my mind, that if the trial &s;hould go again&s;t me, I &s;hould be tortured in a &s;avage-like manner; determining to die on the &s;pot, rather than &s;ubmit to their tortures, which I had frequently before &s;een on their enemies. I a&s;ked liberty to return to my dwelling, to adju&s;t &s;ome affairs there&mdash;I gave my word &s;oon to return, which they (knowing my exalted &s;ta|tion and importance with them,) without he&s;itation granted. I returned to my &s;hop, and armed my&s;elf with two pi&s;tols and a tru&s;ty knife; concealing them under my blanket. Thus prepared for every event, I returned to the court, who were formed in the follow|ing manner; on a block of wood fixed one end in the

ground, about &s;ix feet from its &s;urface, &s;at the chief ju&s;tice; and at his feet on a &s;mall block, &s;at the crimin|al; on the right and left from the chief ju&s;tice, &s;at a number of the chiefs of the Tribe, in a circular form; all &s;itting cro&s;slegged. The court being thus &s;eated, a profound &s;ilence en&s;ued, which continued for two hours &mdash;they all &s;at &s;taring on one another, as if at a lo&s;s in what manner to proceed&mdash;at length the cau&s;e came on, the accu&s;er<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The decea&s;ed's brother.</NOTE> &s;tept forward, and affirmed that I had wantonly killed his friend by &s;hooting him, who was in the lawful pur&s;uit of his bu&s;ine&s;s. That I killed him, I did not pretend to deny; but affirmed that I killed him in my own defence; that he came to my &s;hop at an un&s;ea&s;onable time of the night, and that with an in|tention to kill me, as I could plentifully prove&mdash;upon this, I begged leave to call forward the decea&s;ed's &s;quaw, and the per&s;on pre&s;ent at finding the rum as be|fore related&mdash;this was granted; the witne&s;&s;es came for|ward. The &s;quaw affirmed that her &s;anop, on coming out of his drunken fit, &s;ought for his rum, but could not find it; that on this he appeared much incen&s;ed, enquired of her, who had got his rum; &s;he informed him that Rooo&s;tontee and his friend had de&s;troyed it; he raved round the wigwam and &s;wore revenge, by killing Rooo&s;tontee; and that he on the night in which he was killed, left his home, having loaded his gun

<P>The judge li&s;tened to the charge again&s;t me, and the evidence produced to &s;ub&s;tantiate my defence, ap|peared ripe to pronounce for or again&s;t me.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for the reader to reali&s;e my feelings, at this mo&s;t critical and important moment&mdash;before the tribunal of a &s;avage, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;avage council only, who&s;e friend&s;hip at be&s;t is but momentary. Oh! thought I; if my tender and affectionate father could but view me in my pre&s;ent condition; how would his parental bowels move for me? on his knees, with up lifted hands, would he plead, Oh! &s;pare my darling &s;on once more; &s;et him at liberty&mdash;I know his inno|cence&mdash;let me once more embrace him, who was torn from my arms, doomed to bondage, and unju&s;tly &s;uf|fered already too much, but for &s;avage nature to in|dure&mdash;come ye who are fathers, liberate him, and view the parental embrace, not to be reali&s;ed, but by parents

on &s;imilar occa&s;ions. All this, and much more might have been uttered, had my father been pre&s;ent; but alas! he is at too great a di&s;tance even to hear my cry.</P>
<P>Such thoughts as I have ju&s;t related, &s;truck me with &s;olemn awe; with trembling heart I wi&s;hed for, but dreaded to hear the &s;entence pronounced from the jud|ge's lips. The judge held in his left hand a long &s;tick, his right hand gra&s;ped the dreaded knife. He with maje&s;tic look, turned to the circled chiefs, and ordered them, one at a time, to give their opinions for, or a|gain&s;t the pri&s;oner as he &s;hould direct. Tho&s;e in fa|vour, and willing to acquit him, &s;hould declare by lift|ing up their right hands&mdash;the dreaded moment came, and they one at a time rai&s;ed their right hands; the judge carefully cut a notch on the right &s;ide of his &s;tick, for every one in favour; on the left &s;ide he cut one notch for every up lifted hand again&s;t me. This hav|ing been attended to, the judge counted the favourable notches, and the unfavourable ones, and found the whole number (excepting two) were for &s;etting me at liberty, and &s;trongly recommended me to the good will of my fellow villagers.</P>
<P>This joyful event was publicly notified, and the na|tional pipe brought forward and placed on the block, on which I &s;at when on trial; to which the whole vil|lage a&s;&s;embled and &s;moked in token of approbating the
<PB N="70" REF="038422_0065_1011E9FF14764BE8">
conduct of the judge in &s;etting me at liberty; and in token of receiving me to their former favour and good will; no one (excepting tho&s;e two who had voted a|gain&s;t me) refu&s;ed to &s;moke at the great pipe. Thus the matter ended, and I went much plea&s;ed to my u&s;ual employment.</P>
<P>I worked in my &s;hop daily, but not without fear from tho&s;e who appeared again&s;t me on trial, knowing an Indian's temper&mdash;they never forget a &s;eeming inju|ry; and knowing that tho&s;e two were nearly related to the decea&s;ed&mdash;I therefore, always went armed, ex|pecting &s;ome &s;ecret revenge would &s;oon take place. However, my having gained the good will of our chiefs, by my heroic deeds on many former occa&s;ions; and my conduct in defending my&s;elf, when a&s;&s;aulted by my adver&s;ary, and manfully killing him, &s;erved to keep up my &s;pirits tolerably well. But time, that great de|vourer of pa&s;t evils, however &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on the mind, concurred in lulling me into too great a degree of &s;ecurity, expecting my enemies would forget, and pa&s;s over the &s;uppo&s;ed injuries done them; but in this I was mi&s;taken, as by the &s;equel will appear.</P>
<P>Some time after having occa&s;ion to &s;et and burn a kiln of char-coal, at &s;ome di&s;tance from my home; one night as I was tending my coal without any per|&s;on with me, (having &s;ent my boy home to take his

<P>On my return, my old doctor &s;earched the wound, found that the ball was in my thigh, but could not ex|tract it; &s;he applied &s;ome mollient pla&s;ters, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure ea&s;ed my pain. After laying four days, &s;he delivered me of the ball, by &s;queezing the wound, which by this time had fe&s;tered.</P>
<P>I was under the doctor's hands twenty days before I was able to walk with crutches. My lamene&s;s con|tinued five months. The fear made by this &s;hot, is vi|&s;ible to this day.</P>
<P>Having in a good mea&s;ure recovered, I re&s;umed my former bu&s;ine&s;s; my cu&s;tomers calling every day for

<P>Nothing material turned up for, or again&s;t me for one year after. At length, wanting coal, I erected a new kiln, and in &s;craping up the leaves and dry du&s;t with my hands to cover it over, I rou&s;ed a Rattle Snake; who in his anger bit my hand; at this I was much troubled, &s;uppo&s;ing the bite would prove fatal, but in this was plea&s;ingly di&s;appointed by an effectual cure wrought by a &s;kilful &s;urgeon, who &s;oon came to my help, &s;everal of my neighbours accompanied her, who immediately wound a &s;trong cord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Made from the &s;inews of wild animals.</NOTE> round my arm be|low my elbow, binding it &s;o tight as to prevent the cir|culation of blood below the cord; this done, &s;he with a flint &s;carified my hand, cro&s;&s;ing the wound in different angles; &s;he then with &s;alt in her mouth &s;ucked the poi|&s;on from the wound, on which &s;he &s;trewed &s;ome &s;alt; this was repeated &s;everal times without loo&s;ening the cord until the next day; when the cord is taken off, the &s;wel|ling &s;ub&s;ides, a cure is effected, and my arm, which during the operation was numb and u&s;ele&s;s, immedi|ately recovered its wonted vigor.

<P>With my waiters I departed in my canoe, &s;teering for the main, which I &s;oon recovered, and with our canoe, &amp;c. we directed our cour&s;e through the woods to the neare&s;t water, as there is no travelling a great way through this country without canoes, by rea&s;on of the many lakes and rivers.</P>

<P>On my way I cro&s;&s;ed a river very wide, the water appeared remarkably white, which I under&s;tood was cau&s;ed by a bed of &s;ilver ore.

<P>Two Indian chiefs arrived at my father's with a letter from Colonel Campbell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An officer of di&s;tinction at Montreal, and over&s;eer of the Engli&s;h trade with the Indians.</NOTE> at Montreal. On their coming I was much alarmed, knowing them to belong to a Tribe through which I pa&s;&s;ed, when on my return to Canada. I communicated this to my father, who was much troubled and advi&s;ed me to take no notice of his letter, which was to invite me to repair to Mon|treal, there to undertake to go as interpreter among the Indians to negociate the bu&s;ine&s;s for the Engli&s;h a|mong them. My father anxiou&s;ly enquired of the chiefs what Mr. Campbell wanted of me? why he had &s;ent for me? they replied, they knew nothing of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s. I hearing of Colonel Campbell's gentleman-like character did not he&s;itate, but with the chiefs &s;et off for Montreal.</P>
<P>On my arrival Mr. Campbell informed me, that he was in want of an interpreter to go with the In|dians, &amp;c; the Indians recogni&s;ing my per&s;on, claimed me as having received many favours from them, when among them.

I was &s;o much irritated that I &s;hew my re&s;entment in words, (perhaps too &s;evere) this the Colonel re&s;ented as pointed at him and his King; he called a guard to take me into cu&s;tody&mdash;this incen&s;ed me but the more; I was &s;o far from being intimidated, that I even damned him, and defied his guard.

<P>MUCH hath been &s;aid and publi&s;hed (by the learned) on the origin of the aborigines of this country at different periods, &s;ince the fir&s;t di&s;covery and &s;ettlement of America, by Europeans. However plau&s;ible their hypothetical mode of rea&s;oning may be, nothing as yet hath ever appeared &s;ufficiently conclu|&s;ive on that &s;ubject, and I conceive never can be, as the materials nece&s;&s;ary for compiling an authentic hi&s;tory never can be obtained; the natives not having it in their power to give any account from whence their ance&s;tors &s;prang, nor even to give any account of matters that have taken place in modern times any further back, than by &s;aying that &s;uch and &s;uch matters, as battles fought by them and victory on their &s;ide &s;ucceeded, &amp;c. &s;o many moons pa&s;t, (as they count by moons that alternately &s;ucceed after &s;uch events.)</P>
<P>Any further attempts, therefore, to trace Indian chronology &s;o far as to reduce it to any tolerable de|gree of &s;atisfaction, mu&s;t be fruitle&s;s; however, I leave that to tho&s;e who are plea&s;ed with the &s;tudy of artiqui|ty,

<P>As my re&s;idence among tho&s;e Indians to whom I was given was for a con&s;iderable length of time, the account I propo&s;e to give of them may be depended on, having been an eye witne&s;s to many of their move|ments, both in war and peace, my&s;elf being accounted, by them, as one, and that of no &s;mall con&s;equence, both in the cabinet and in the field of Mars.</P>

That Tribe was the mo&s;t numerous (as I was informed by their chiefs) of any in that part of America, and mo&s;t warlike, as I often reali&s;ed this during my re&s;i|dence with them, not having known them once to fail in their warlike feats, either defen&s;ive or offen&s;ive.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. OF THEIR PERSONS, DRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THEY are in general tall and &s;trait limbed. A de|formed per&s;on is rarely to be found among them. Their &s;kin is of a copper colour&mdash;their eyes are large and very black, and of a piercing &s;ight, di&s;covering objects, though &s;mall, at a great di&s;tance, in&s;omuch, that they &s;eldom fail of &s;triking the mark aimed at by the guide of the feathered arrow. Their teeth are well &s;et, and &s;eldom fail, even in old age&mdash;their breath &s;weet as the gentle zephyr of an unclouded morning of May &mdash;their cheek bones are rather rai&s;ed, more &s;o in the female than the male; the former are more fle&s;hy, and &s;horter than the latter. The hair of both &s;exes is very long, coar&s;e, and of the blacke&s;t hue; the females pride them&s;elves much in the length and &s;traitne&s;s of theirs; for this purpo&s;e they frequently apply Bear's grea&s;e, and a certain powder pulveri&s;ed from the bark of elm or brown a&s;h; thus prepared, they hang to the extremity of their hair lead weights, which &s;erves to facilitate the growth.</P>
<P>The Indians are careful to prevent the growth of any hair upon any part of their body, the hairy &s;calp only excepted. The males extract their beards, &amp;c.
<PB N="98" REF="038422_0093_1011EA55E5A6EE68">
with nippers made of wire, procured from the Span|iards.</P>
<P>The males of all ranks, from the warrior to the pappoo&s;e, are marked with the &s;un on the out&s;ide of the right leg, the moon and &s;even &s;tars on the in&s;ide of the &s;ame: tho&s;e of the males who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves by their extraordinary exertions in war, and there|by acquired great names, are di&s;tingui&s;hed from others by the &s;ingular dre&s;s of the head. The hair is plucked from the head, except a &s;mall portion on the back part the bigne&s;s of a man's hand; the hair thus left on is permitted to grow to a great length, and ornamented with &s;ilver broaches and feathers of various colours, from the crown of the head to the extremity of the hair. Their blankets al&s;o, are of the fir&s;t quality, and ornamented with &s;ilver cla&s;ps; the fir&s;t, which is fixed at the nape of the neck behind, is as large as a crown piece, and are placed equidi&s;tant in a &s;trait line to the bottom of the blanket. Each cla&s;p or broach (for 'tis immaterial which, ju&s;t as it &s;uits the hero) proportion|ably decrea&s;e in &s;ize from the uppermo&s;t to the lower|mo&s;t, which is fixed at the lowe&s;t extremity, and not larger than a piece of &s;ilver coin of the &s;malle&s;t value. The per&s;ons thus decorated, are re&s;pected by the com|monalty at fea&s;ts, tournaments, and all public games, as the nobility and gentry of European nations are by the pea&s;antry.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="038422_0094_1011EA58F5C82C58">The Indians of both &s;exes are fond of paint, and u&s;e it on all occa&s;ions. The males in going to war paint their faces of different colours, the right &s;ide black, the left red, &s;ometimes in chequers of various colours, as black, red, green, yellow, &amp;c. The females paint a &s;mall portion of each cheek of vermillion, at &s;ome particular &s;ea&s;ons their arms and necks, their brea&s;t al&s;o they pay particular attention to.

<P>The common dre&s;s of the males con&s;i&s;ts of a blank|et, clout and &s;hirt, unconfined at the ri&s;ts or collar, this would confine their arms &s;o much as to prevent any great exertions of the body; their legs and feet are covered with &s;tockings of Beaver &s;kins, and moga&s;ons of Moo&s;e hide poorly dre&s;&s;ed. Their blankets are carefully thrown over their &s;houlders, holding the upper end by two corners; with a tru&s;ty knife in one hand, pipe, tobacco pouch, &amp;c. in the other, they walk about the village; but in their dances, they throw off the blanket.</P>
<P>The females wear a covering, &s;ome of leather, oth|ers of linnen, when they can procure it from the Span|iards; this often happens, which covers the peticoats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their peticoats are made of Moo&s;e hide or coar&s;e cloth, when attainable.</NOTE>

down to the knees&mdash;their legs and feet are dre&s;&s;ed like the males.</P>
<P>The manner of con&s;tructing their wigwams hath already, in the memoirs, been &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed. Their uten&s;ils for dome&s;tic convenience, are in general tolerable, &s;uch as bra&s;s kettles, both large and &s;mall, as occa&s;ion requires. Knives are &s;eldom u&s;ed but in &s;calping and carving on wood, making wooden la|dles, &amp;c. Their ve&s;&s;els u&s;ed at fea&s;ts are wooden di&s;h|es and bowls; into which the prepared food is dipped by wooden ladles. Every member of a family or collect|ed multitude, is furni&s;hed with a wooden &s;poon tolera|bly executed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. OF THEIR MANNERS, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE males in general live an idle, carele&s;s life, never undertaking bu&s;ine&s;s in a dome&s;tic line, leaving that to the females, who not only execute every kind of manual labour at home, but are obliged to travel into the woods and bring home the game, whether great or &s;mall, when obtained by their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>Each family hath a particular &s;pot of ground a&s;|&s;igned it by the chiefs, whereon to rai&s;e corn, beans, &amp;c; all which is tilled by the females of each family, and in autumn, whatever grows thereon, whether corn or any other vegetable, the profits of their labour is care|fully &s;ecured, &s;o that the males are left to their ea&s;e, while at home, reali&s;ing that the wife is truly an help meat.</P>
<P>What adds much to the arduous toil of the women already de&s;cribed, is, they are obliged to carry with them into the corn field &s;uch infants as depend on the mother's brea&s;t for &s;upport. Tho&s;e children are care|fully la&s;hed to the concave &s;ide of &s;ome thick bark, or to &s;ome piece of wood formed for that purpo&s;e. From the wigwam to the field the tender mother carries her

The tender offs|pring therefore is reared, corporally, active and vigo|rous; the young and expanding mind, the better part mu&s;t have an almo&s;t unbounded latitude for growth when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the more accompli&s;hed arti&s;t; for want of this, the young &s;avage dwindles down to as abject a &s;tate of u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s as the long cultivated debau|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hee in (what are called polite and well informed nations.)</P>
<P>The males are careful not to intrude into the fe|males company at particular times, when obliged &s;e|cretly to retire&mdash;during the continuance of certain pe|riodical evacuations to which the females are peculiarly incident, or in the more important hour of nature's &s;truggle into life.</P>

<P>Such is the conduct of the re&s;pective nur&s;es towards their &s;everal charges, leaving the management of na|tional concerns, more weighty and more important for national protection to the males, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to plan and execute all matters tending to peace or war.

<P>When the moon does not appear they &s;ay it is dead; when it fir&s;t appears they &s;ay it is come to life again. They make no further divi&s;ion of time into weeks, hours, &amp;c; but when conveying the idea of a day they call it a &s;leep.</P>
<P>They are totally ignorant of geography, yet will draw on birch bark, charts tolerably exact of their country, &amp;c. They direct their travels in the night,

<P>During my tarry with them I frequently endeavour|ed to in&s;truct them in my mode of reckoning, but their fondne&s;s for prefering their own, by counting a cer|tain number of beads, prevailed; I therefore gave over any further attempt.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. THEIR MODE OF GOVERNMENT, MANNER OF CONVEY|ING INTELLIGENCE TO OTHER TRIBES IN ALLIANCE WITH THEM, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Scanyawtauragahrooote Tribe being very nu|merous and warlike, particular care is taken, both in dome&s;tic and di&s;tant operations, when called &s;epa|rately as a nation, or in junction with &s;ome other Tribe. The per&s;ons who are cho&s;en to conduct as chiefs (for they are con&s;idered as &s;eparate departments) act &s;ep|arately. The one who conducts the operations of war and peace, is one who has long been approved
<PB N="107" REF="038422_0102_1011EA6F5936A2B8">
in warlike feats, for he ri&s;es purely by merit, is prefer|ed, and is implicitly obeyed, no one ever daring to op|po&s;e his mandates; but may, when called upon by the chief, give his opinion on the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t mode of advance or retreat.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who conducts their internal police, is one who hath by long and often tried abilities approv|ed him&s;elf one of &s;ound and judicious abilities; mo&s;t likely to govern without au&s;terity, partiality or preju|dice whatever he undertakes to decide upon. He pays particular attention to the charge alledged again&s;t the offender; never admits circum&s;tantial evidence as having any weight, either in condemning or acquiting the accu&s;ed. All the evidence pro and con, is impar|tially weighed, and without favour or affection decided upon. Tho&s;e of the males who are di&s;tingui&s;hed as above de&s;cribed, are ever elected whenever a vacancy requires a new choice, never admitting of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In their dome&s;tic government, a number of per&s;ons are elected to execute matters of le&s;s con&s;equence; as to put into execution certain mandates i&s;&s;ued by the com|mander in chief, and are often called upon as a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants to the &s;upreme judge, in trying and deciding mat|ters of life and death.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="038422_0103_1011EA738EDE2ED0">Whenever occa&s;ion requires to &s;end intelligence to di&s;tant Tribes, 'tis done by arranging a certain num|ber of beads of different colours, in &s;uch a manner as to convey the intended idea of intelligence. The bead which is to begin the fir&s;t word is &s;topped up at its eye, and is of a larger &s;ize. A number of beads of the &s;ame colour are placed in a direct line to the right, and &s;o on, alternately placing different coloured and &s;ized beads &s;o as to convey the whole of the propo&s;ed in|telligence. The per&s;ons thus informing, and thus receiving intelligence, are &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed &s;o as to convey and receive certain and infalible intelligence.</P>
<P>Soon after the death or re&s;ignation of any one of the commanders in chief, the whole of the males a&s;|&s;emble for a new choice, which is made in open air, and in a convenient place for that purpo&s;e. The national pipe is brought on, and a large block is fixed in the ground at a &s;mall di&s;tance, on which the candidate is placed, cro&s;slegged (for they &s;et up but one at a time.) The matter is determined by the number of per&s;ons who alternately &s;moke at the pipe: if a large majori|ty u&s;e the pipe at this time, 'tis determined in favour of the fir&s;t candidate, if otherwi&s;e, a &s;econd is &s;et up as the fir&s;t, and the Tribe proceed as before, and &s;o on until one is cho&s;en by a majority of &s;mokers pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Whenever a per&s;on is cho&s;en, proclamation is im|mediately made of the per&s;on, his age and qualities.
<PB N="109" REF="038422_0104_1011EA76C7C4A9A8">
If he accepts the office, all per&s;ons without di&s;tinction encircle him; he then makes a lengthy &s;peech, declar|ing his acceptance and determination &s;trictly to adhere to their national laws, and his determiation inviolately to hand down to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or all the rights and cere|monies peculiar to their nation. The multitude are then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The &s;achem exerci&s;es all the authority given him as handed down by his predece&s;&s;or, until his power cea&s;eth, which is at his death or re&s;ignation only.</P>
<P>As it rarely happens that any one re&s;igns his office, electioneering but &s;eldom takes place among them. It often happens that the young warriors are called upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t in council on matters of war or peace. They attentively li&s;ten to the arguments for or again&s;t any propo&s;ed que&s;tion, never &s;peaking on the &s;ubject; but by &s;aying I approve or di&s;approve, and that will do or will not do, ju&s;t as it &s;uits him. The whole debate ends by the large&s;t number of an&s;wers as above.</P>
<P>The war and civil departments are by their prima|ry con&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their code of laws are handed down inviolate from gen|eration to generation, and are the &s;ame that their ance&s;tors slave to.</NOTE> &s;o formed, that one never interferes or cla&s;hes with the other.

to the laws formed to &s;upport and to carry into effect, the mandates i&s;&s;ued by its particular com|mander in chief.</P>
<P>Such is the power of long habit, no one of inferior rank ever &s;hews the lea&s;t reluctance in performing whatever is in his power, &s;paring no pains day nor night, but cheerfully executes all orders properly authenticated, even at the hazard of his life; ever keep|ing it in his mind, that to pre&s;erve his own life and property, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to dedicate his own power and time to the national welfare. However, it &s;ome times (though rarely) happens that one or two will re&s;ent and endeavour to fru&s;trate the purpo&s;es and decrees of the civil magi&s;trate, as was the ca&s;e on my trial. Whenever &s;uch conduct is di&s;covered, the offenders are puni&s;hed with death, and that in a mo&s;t excrucia|ting manner, unle&s;s prevented by the delinquents leav|ing the nation for ever after.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. OF THEIR FEASTS AND DANCES.</HEAD>
<P>FEASTING and dancing, among the Indians, are accounted the mo&s;t honorable and &s;atisfactory pa&s;t time. Nothing is wanted, in their power to furni&s;h, on public fea&s;ts, to render the entertainment mo&s;t agreea|ble.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="038422_0106_1011EA7B30857688">The animal food they u&s;e principally, is of the Buffalo, Bear, Beaver and Racoon, with many other &s;mall meats, as their appetite may direct their choice.</P>
<P>Whenever a public fea&s;t is propo&s;ed by the com|mander in chief of the civil department, preparation is immediately made in &s;ome airy and convenient &s;pot; for the whole Tribe, male and female, a&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>A certain number of cooks and waiters prepare the food, by boiling Bear, Buffalo, Beaver, Deer and Moo&s;e&mdash;but above all, the tail of the Beaver is prefer|ed and &s;erved up to the commanders in chief. With this variety of meat is added Indian corn and beans, all boiled together in &s;uch a manner that it is eat, both fle&s;h and vegetables, with &s;poons only.</P>
<P>The fea&s;t being prepared, the multitude a&s;&s;emble and form a circle on the ground cro&s;slegged&mdash;in the centre the national pipe is placed, in a manner already de&s;cribed. The two chiefs &s;it near the pipe on blocks cro&s;slegged. A particular attention is paid to them by waiters of di&s;tinction. As &s;oon as may be, the col|lected citizens are &s;erved by waiters placed on different quarters, with the food in wooden bowls, each one &s;ep|arately&mdash;to each a wooden &s;poon is added. By a par|ticular &s;ign given by the ma&s;ter of ceremonies, every gue&s;t begins at one and the &s;ame time, ever bearing in mind never to crack a bone which may fall to his &s;hare, and to eat all contained in his di&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="038422_0107_1011D06597E8C210">The fea&s;t ended, they all ri&s;e and carry towards a large fire, (prepared for the purpo&s;e) his bowl, into which the bony contents is flung, and there left to con&s;ume. This done, the bowls and &s;poons are care|fully &s;ecured in &s;ome convenient department, always ready for future u&s;e.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embled multitude then &s;urround the great pipe, and (led on by the commanders) alternately &s;moke, which further cements the nation. Dancing now takes place, which is performed in equal divi&s;ional parties, led on by each re&s;pective ma&s;ter, with an e|qual number of mu&s;icians, each furni&s;hed with the in&s;tru|ment of mu&s;ic already de&s;cribed, or in want thereof, with a bra&s;s kettle turned bottom upwards. The mu&s;ic being well performed, &s;erves to animate the dancers, and adds much to the entertainment: each dancer carefully ob&s;erves time, as beaten by the players.</P>
<P>After dancing for &s;ome con&s;iderable length of time, a new &s;cene takes place, which begins by &s;ome di&s;tin|gui&s;hed warrior, who &s;teps forward and in a loud, vehe|ment voice, harangues the multitude to the following purpo&s;e, viz.</P>

<P>Your &s;ituation is &s;uch, having good lands for tillage, and hunting ground &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of your families at home, and the warrior whenever called to defend his national, unimpaired liberties.

Let no root of bit|terne&s;s &s;pring up to choak the better growth of peace, at different periods &s;own and cultivated by your re&s;|pective leaders.</P></Q>
<P>To this they all give their approbation, by whoop|ing, clapping hands, and at proper intervals pronoun|cing the words, true, you have told nothing but the truth; united we &s;tand, but divided we fall. Then each one adds Peacock feathers, and other party col|oured ones to their caps, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. OF THEIR HUNTING, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;upplies of the more &s;ub&s;tantial part of their food being obtained by hunting, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that a very con&s;iderable portion of their time &s;hould be taken up in this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary article. Great care therefore is taken that every ri&s;ing generation of the males &s;hould be well in&s;tructed in this art.</P>
<P>They are early taught the u&s;e of the bow and ar|row, by &s;hooting at marks fixed at a proper di&s;tance from the archer. This is daily practiced until the young pupil becomes a complete mark&s;man, not inferior to
<PB N="115" REF="038422_0110_1011EA84CBB5E8D8">
his in&s;tructor. They are al&s;o practiced in wielding the tomahawk, which is peculiarly &s;erviceable in hunt|ing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The hunting &s;ea&s;on approaching, peparation is made for that purpo&s;e by fixing their traps, bows, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t hunting &s;ea&s;on commenceth about the fir&s;t of November annually, and continues with but &s;mall intervals during the winter, until March: after this month, and &s;o on during the &s;ummer, animals of every &s;pecies are of le&s;s value, whether for food or cloth|ing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The quadrupeds they principally aim at in hunting, are the Buffalo, Deer, Moo&s;e, Bear, Otter, Beaver, Raccoon and the Porcupine. At this time the indo|lence peculiar to the hunters during the &s;ummer &s;ea|&s;on is lo&s;t, and an active, per&s;evering, indefatigable &s;pirit pervades the whole.</P>
<P>They are &s;agacious in di&s;covering the retreat of the animal they propo&s;e to hunt, and are equally &s;o in the means u&s;ed to de&s;troy it. They can ea&s;ily di&s;cover the foot&s;teps of the Bea&s;ts they are in pur&s;uit of, although imperceptible by every other traveller, and with cer|tainty follow their prey through the pathle&s;s wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Their particular movements on this occa&s;ion, are by a council in the previous &s;ummer determined upon,
<PB N="116" REF="038422_0111_1011EA865824D8E0">
as well as the number each party &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of (for they hunt in different companies, and pur&s;ue different routs.)</P>
<P>Their method of hunting the Buffalo hath al|ready been de&s;cribed.&mdash;Previous to each company's &s;etting out on their different routs, agreeably to the de|termination of the council, every per&s;on belonging to each company prepares him&s;elf by fa&s;ting three days; during which, he neither ta&s;tes of food nor even water, nor &s;uffers his dog, who he propo&s;es to accompany him, to eat any thing. During this &s;elf denial they appear alert and happy.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons they give for this fa&s;ting, is, that it keeps off the evil &s;pirit, and renders their enterpri&s;es mo&s;t propitious; that it cau&s;eth them to dream what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue in order to obtain the be&s;t and greate&s;t quantity of game, &amp;c.</P>
<P>All the prerequi&s;ites being made ready, each party &s;ets out under the direction of &s;ome long experienced hunter, taking with them their dogs and a &s;mall num|ber of young archers.</P>
<P>Various methods are practiced to hunt the Deer: &s;ometimes by &s;hooting him with the arrow, &s;ometimes by knocking him in head with the tomahawk when o|vertaken in deep &s;now; but the mo&s;t effectual method
<PB N="117" REF="038422_0112_1011EA8964C53D10">
is by forming a triangular fence enclo&s;ing a &s;mall piece of meadow, to which they re&s;ort.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their haunts are ea&s;ily di&s;covered by their trampling down the &s;now in que&s;t of food, &amp;c.</NOTE> This fence is con|&s;tructed of pliable poles interwoven between po&s;ts &s;et up at a proper di&s;tance one from the other. Within this triangular fence &s;nares are prepared from the rhine of certain weeds, not unlike the nettle of this country, &s;pontaneou&s;ly growing with them, and are &s;o fixed that the animal coming within this enclo&s;ure cannot retreat, but is ea&s;ily taken.</P>
<P>Any number di&s;covered in the woods are by the hunters and their dogs put in motion and drove on un|til caught by the &s;nares. This method is le&s;s expen&s;ive and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The Moo&s;e is hunted by fir&s;t di&s;covering his foot|&s;teps in the &s;now, which the hunters with weary and per&s;evering &s;teps pur&s;ue until the animals are overtak|en in their retreats (for they herd together, &s;ometimes a large number, ju&s;t as it happens) which is called the Moo&s;eyard, formed by them in trampling down the &s;now, a &s;pace &s;ufficiently large to contain the a&s;&s;embled num|ber. Here they tarry until all the &s;mall branches of the &s;urrounding trees are entirely lopped off by the Moo&s;e, or driven from thence by the hunters, their never failing enemy.</P>

<P>The Bear is caught frequently by &s;etting traps, for they have no particular place of re&s;ort, unle&s;s when in their dens, which are generally the hollow of &s;ome re|maining &s;tub of &s;ome old tree, or under &s;ome roots of windfalls; they are therefore but accidentally di&s;|covered.</P>
<P>The method of &s;etting traps, is fir&s;t to find &s;ome old tree mo&s;t likely for them to repair to for winter quarters: into this tree about &s;ix inches from the ground a hole is made, into which a large plug is driven, and at ten feet in a direct line a &s;take is fixed in the ground of about &s;ix feet in height from the plug fixed in the tree, to the top of the &s;take a heavy pole is &s;lightly laid on, and on either &s;ide from the tree to the &s;take wood is piled up in &s;uch a manner as to prevent the Bear's retreat, but at the entrance a piece of fi&s;h is fixed on the end of the pole as near the plug as may be, which allures the hungry animal to the bait, and as &s;oon as
<PB N="119" REF="038422_0114_1011EA8FC7815748">
touched, the pole which is &s;ufficiently large and heavy, falls, and at once cru&s;hes the unwary Bear.</P>
<P>The Otter being an amphibious animal, is caught principally by &s;etting &s;teel traps in the water &s;ufficiently deep as to cover the trap &s;o as not to be di&s;covered by the animal. The trap is baited by fi&s;h of any kind, the more &s;tale the better. Near the trap a &s;take is fixed, and &s;meared with the entrails of fi&s;h, the more putrified the greater the attraction. The trap and &s;take thus pre|pared, great care mu&s;t be taken to allure the Otter to the trap; for this purpo&s;e the hunter in leav|ing the trap, goes a circuitous rout to a point about one fourth of a mile from the bait, then rubs over the bottoms of his moga&s;ons tainted fi&s;h, then in his mog|a&s;ons, travels on in a &s;trait line to the trap; this leaves on the ground a &s;cent &s;ufficiently &s;trong for the purpo&s;e: this done, the moga&s;ons are taken off, and the hunter, barefooted, in a new rout returns fully &s;atisfied with the &s;ufficiency of his trap and precaution, which &s;el|dom fail.</P>
<P>The Beaver is al&s;o an amphibious animal, and of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the hunter, as well for food as for clothing and bedding. The tail properly dre&s;&s;ed is accounted the mo&s;t delicious of any meat whatever, and &s;ought for at all public entertainments. The fle&s;h of

the Beaver is al&s;o much valued by the Indians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This animal affords the much valued Ca&s;tor, famed for its medicinal qualities.</NOTE>&mdash;the fur not only &s;erves for clothing, &amp;c. but is the mo&s;t valuable article for trade with the Spaniards of South America, with whom our Indians barter for &s;uch ar|ticles as are not to be found among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of animals are by many con&s;idered as under a particular mode of government, not unlike re|publicani&s;m, mo&s;t &s;agacious, and not only endeavour to prevent the a&s;&s;aults of the hunters, but al&s;o intru&s;ions of animals le&s;s formidable. Nothing however can pre|vent their regular and artful mode of con&s;tructing hab|itations exactly &s;uited for their convenience and comfort, but more of this hereafter.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e animals ever herd together, every precau|tion is taken, by them, to prevent being taken by &s;ur|pri&s;e; for this purpo&s;e they are careful to &s;ix guards at proper intervals. The tru&s;ty guard give the earlie&s;t in|telligence to the community, who immediately &s;ecreet them&s;elves in a retreat beyond the &s;kill of the intruder to penetrate. Every precaution therefore is nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed by the hunter to become &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Many methods are alternately tried, &s;ome with ev|ery prerequi&s;ite, however fail; but the mo&s;t approved mode is by &s;etting &s;teel traps.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="038422_0116_1011EA942931FD70">In catching every other amphibious animal with &s;teel traps, &s;ome bait particularly &s;uited to allure the devoted quadruped, is cautiou&s;ly fixed to each trap; but in catching the Beaver a quite different method is u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The hunter on finding their dam, carefully &s;urveys its extent and particular con&s;truction, and at &s;ome con|venient place in the dam makes a &s;mall breach on the upper &s;ide, next to the &s;tagnated water, fixes his trap nine inches below the &s;urface; this &s;erves to catch the olde&s;t Beavers fir&s;t, and by this mode the greater part of the community are taken, for the old ones finding the water lower above the dam, cautiou&s;ly &s;end out the younge&s;t to &s;earch the breach, and by rea&s;on of their &s;hort legs &s;wim over the trap without harm; upon this the full grown ones venture out and &s;wim towards the breach, and are taken. As &s;oon as the olde&s;t ones are taken, the trap is placed nearer the &s;urface of the water, proportional to the length of the young Bea|ver's legs, they al&s;o are in like manner taken.</P>
<P>Many traps are fixed as above, ju&s;t as the hunters think be&s;t, and all are fixed in the day time. At night the over matched animals leave their retreats to exam|ine their dam, and to mend whatever breaches are made.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="038422_0117_1011EA972F902D90">The Raccoon is generally found in the cavity, formed by the ravages of time in large trees. As &s;oon as their retreat is di&s;covered, a trap is fixed at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the tree, thus, a &s;emi-circular fence is formed by driving into the ground a &s;ufficient number of &s;takes at about three inches one from the other: within this &s;pace a crotched &s;take is fixed, on which a heavy pole is placed, and at its inmo&s;t extremity, a bait, either of fi&s;h or fle&s;h is placed: the Raccoon in helping him&s;elf to the bait &s;tarts the pole, which in&s;tantly falls, and the hungry animal is taken.</P>
<P>The Porcupine is often di&s;covered when in &s;earch for food in the day time, ever retreating at night to his den, which is dug into the &s;ide of a hill or moun|tain. Whenever he is &s;een in open air he is &s;hot by the archer with his well directed feathered arrow; &s;ometimes he is found in his den, which is known by introducing a long pole; the hunter on di&s;covering the animal is careful to fa&s;ten the end of the pole into the Porcupine's hair and pulls out the devoted creature to the den's mouth, where he is &s;ecured.</P>
<P>Smaller animals are occa&s;ionally hunted, principal|ly by the archers, excepting the Mink, Mu&s;k-Rat, Sa|ble, Fox and Wolfe, which are caught by traps &s;imply prepared: the meat and fur is &s;ecured&mdash;the meat by &s;moking&mdash;the fur is carefully dried in the air and &s;un, and in a proper time the hunters return to their re&s;pec|tive

<P>On the hunters return an equal di&s;tribution of game is made, which being often repeated, would &s;oon en|rich the Indians, provided they di&s;po&s;ed of their prop|erty to any good advantage, but their being unac|quainted with the proper mode of traffic, they are ea|&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, and the end of one hunt is but the beginning of a &s;econd, and &s;o on during the hunting &s;ea&s;on. Nece&s;&s;ity, however, urges them to practice hunting as often as the &s;ea&s;ons will permit, as their principal dependance for &s;upport is on the bea&s;ts of the wilderne&s;s; who are very numerous, and during the winter (which is the be&s;t hunting &s;ea&s;on) are very fat.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the manner of catching the animals there particularly mentioned, I omitted de&s;cribing the manner of catching the Fox, and although not in order, in this place for the benefit of hunters in this country, I here give it.</P>
<P>The Fox is the mo&s;t &s;ubtil and difficult to catch of any animal whatever; therefore the greate&s;t care and &s;ecrecy is nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved to take him. He is catched in a &s;teel trap.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. DESCRIPTION OF THEIR WEAPONS FOR WAR, METHOD, OF CONDUCTING THEIR WARS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>INDIANS in general are tenacious of their rights and priviledges, jealous of their neighbours, le&s;t at any time they intrude on hunting ground not their own, (for each Tribe hath a particular piece of land a&s;&s;ign|ed it, as well for tillage as hunting.) Some Tribes have a larger extent of territory than others. The Tribe to which I belonged, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed hunting ground extending not only throughout the i&s;land, but on the main al&s;o, &s;ome part far di&s;tant from our village; therefore often tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon by the neighbouring Tribes. This being the ca&s;e, our nation always were

(excepting in hunting &s;ea&s;ons) planning and carrying on war, or receiving overtures for peace from &s;ome Tribe or other.</P>
<P>As Indians are naturally &s;prightly, enterpri&s;ing and indefatigable, and of a re&s;tle&s;s, unea&s;y make, add to this their jealous, &s;u&s;picious temper; they &s;eem peculiar|ly fitted for war and really delight in its operations, however rigorous and doubtful.</P>
<P>The yearly trade our Indians carry on with the Spaniards (as hath been ob&s;erved) gives them opportu|nities &s;ufficient to furni&s;h them&s;elves with fire arms and ammunition, which the Indians are careful to keep in readine&s;s, prepared at all times to repel inva&s;ions, or to carry into effect a plan of warlike operation with &s;ome di&s;tant Tribe.</P>
<P>The Tomahawk and &s;calping knife al&s;o, are arti|cles peculiarly u&s;eful, e&s;pecially when clo&s;ely engaged with the enemy.</P>
<P>They are careful not to burden them&s;elves with baggage unnece&s;&s;ary; carrying from home but a &s;mall quantity of provi&s;ion,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sometimes killing &s;mall game with the arrow, not di&s;|charging their guns, le&s;t it &s;hould alarm the enemy.</NOTE> unle&s;s the nation they propo&s;e to contend with are at a great di&s;tance, in &s;uch a ca&s;e,

<P>Be&s;ides the weapons above de&s;cribed, our i&s;landers &s;ometimes u&s;e the bow and arrow on particular occa|&s;ions: their chief dependance being on the fire arms and tomahawk.</P>
<P>Their movements previous to their march, con&s;ult|ing the Powow or praying Indian, &amp;c. &amp;c&punc; hath in the memoirs been &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed; however, I would here ob&s;erve that in their marches they make as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, and whenever they travel over land whereon their feet make any impre&s;&s;ion, they are care|ful to cover &s;uch foot-&s;teps previous to their departure, le&s;t the enemy &s;hould thereby di&s;cover their route and numbers.</P>
<P>Their treatment of their captives is ever practiced as de&s;cribed in the before cited pa&s;&s;age.&mdash;The return of the warriors to the village is announced by their whooping, as often repeated as they have recovered pri&s;oners and &s;calps.

They al&s;o

<P>The nations thus forming a peace, are con&s;idered as in alliance with the Scanyawtauragahrooote Nation; and when called upon by them to act in connection, whether in an offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive manner, never fail.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. OF THEIR DIVERSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Indians are often at lei&s;ure, and have many opportunities of gratifying their pa&s;&s;ions for different kinds of diver&s;ion, as playing ball, running, leaping, &s;hooting with the bow and arrow, throwing the tom|ahawk, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In playing at ball, they form them&s;elves into companies of about twenty each&mdash;&s;electing &s;ome lev|el, &s;mooth piece of ground, mo&s;t &s;uitable for this pur|po&s;e. Each company is divided into two equal parts, and a bet is laid, con&s;i&s;ting of a certain number of broaches, as by the parties agreed on, to be delivered to the victors. As the broaches, previous to the game,
<PB N="134" REF="038422_0129_1011EAB94EC3F3F8">
are delivered into the hands of &s;ome tru&s;ty by&s;tander, that &s;ide which gains the victory never fails of receiv|ing it.</P>
<P>Their balls are made in an orbicular form of Buf|falo's hair, and covered with leather of Moo&s;e hide.&mdash; The in&s;trument with which they &s;trike the ball, is about four feet in length&mdash;in form like a fi&s;hhook. That part de&s;igned to &s;trike the ball is interwoven with the &s;inews of Deer, which (on &s;triking the ball) by rea&s;on of its ela&s;ticity, &s;ends it to a much greater di&s;|tance than if &s;truck by a &s;tick prepared as in this country.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who &s;trikes the ball, &s;tands near to a hole formed in the ground, to which another &s;tanding at a di&s;tance, aims to trundle the ball, into which (if not prevented by him who holds the &s;tick) it will fall, and then the game&s;ter gives up his &s;tick to &s;ome other of his &s;ide, and &s;o the game goes on until the whole number cho&s;en on both &s;ides have alternately gone through the &s;ame.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e, the per&s;on to whom the broaches are delivered, having kept an exact account of the number of times they on &s;triking the ball run from the hole to a &s;take fixed at a certain di&s;tance as agreed upon, while the trundl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> recovers the ball every time it is &s;truck on
<PB N="135" REF="038422_0130_1011EABC09E02320">
both &s;ides, and that &s;ide in who&s;e favour the per&s;on to whom it is left gives the preference, receives the broaches, and thus the game ends.</P>
<P>Running matches are frequently formed among them; at &s;uch times a large number collect, when a certain mark is made on the ground from which the combatants take their departure; they run to a mark made in the ground at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the fir&s;t mark as by the company is determined upon. The race commences &s;ometimes by two only, but often of a larger number, ju&s;t as it happens. The wager is made by depo&s;iting a certain quantity of broaches into the hands of &s;ome indifferent per&s;on, who gives them to him who fir&s;t cro&s;&s;eth the la&s;t fixed bounds, near which the man who determines the conte&s;t &s;tands. The run|ners lay a&s;ide every part of their clothing that may in the lea&s;t retard their motion.

<P>The u&s;e of the bow and arrow is of &s;o much con|&s;equence to the nation, that great pains are taken, early to in&s;truct the youth in this art, de&s;igned for hunters and warriors; for this purpo&s;e, a certain number of good mark&s;men are a&s;&s;igned as in&s;tructors, who daily lead forth a certain number of boys, and by repeated trials they become ma&s;ters, and can with exactne&s;s &s;trike a mark fixed at a rea&s;onable di&s;tance.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. OF THEIR MANNNER OF COURTSHIP, MATRI|MONIAL CEREMONIES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NO Nation, whether civilized or not (that I have ever read or have any knowledge of) ever have totally omitted certain ceremonies to be u&s;ed in joining the male to his female; although it rarely happens that any two nations make u&s;e of the &s;ame form for one and the &s;ame purpo&s;e; that is, in forming a new and endearing connection between two per&s;ons of oppo&s;ite &s;exes, under the character of hu&s;band and wife.</P>
<P>Some of the Indian Tribes (as I was informed, when on my return to Canada) proceed to the mar|riage ceremony without any previous acquaintance, or even the con&s;ent of the parties; but with the Scanyaw|tauragahrooote Tribe 'tis quite otherwi&s;e, for previous to marriage, a court&s;hip takes place between the man and woman, who are afterwards married.</P>
<P>Whenever a &s;ingle man wi&s;hes to form an acquain|tance with any particular female, he pays the family, to whom &s;he belongs, a vi&s;it in the evening; if &s;he hap|pens to be at home, after a &s;hort introductory conver|&s;ation with the father, he fixes his eyes upon the female
<PB N="139" REF="038422_0134_1011EAC6A93CA7E8">
he propo&s;es to form a new connection with. After &s;et|ting without uttering one word for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, he then takes a &s;tick of about four inches in length (for he always at &s;uch times carries three &s;ticks with him) and throws it into her lap; &s;he knowing the in|tention, carefully &s;ecures it; he then after a &s;hort in|terval throws a &s;econd &s;tick, and then the third&mdash;&s;he &s;ecures the whole number; this done, the man imme|diately retires and leaves the family to their wonted repo&s;e. Then on the next &s;ucceeding evening he vi&s;its the &s;ame family, and in the &s;ame manner &s;pends his time, not forgetting to leave the &s;ame number of &s;ticks as above, and &s;o the next &s;ucceeding night, performing the &s;ame ceremony. The third and la&s;t evening, the fe|male having received nine &s;ticks; if &s;he approves of his &s;uit, carefully keeping the whole number, runs im|mediately out of the wigwam, followed by her lover, to a &s;hort di&s;tance from the habitation, when a &s;hort dia|logue between them takes place; then each retire to their own wigwams; but if &s;he di&s;approves of his &s;uit, &s;he on the third evening throws the nine &s;ticks into her &s;uiter's face, and &s;o the matter ends. If his vi&s;its are approved of, her parents make preparation to &s;olem|nize the marriage, which is performed the fir&s;t day af|ter concluded upon in a convenient place in open air.</P>
<P>On this important occa&s;ion, a large number collect of all ages and &s;exes, where they are entertained by
<PB N="140" REF="038422_0135_1011EAC8375E7BF8">
fea&s;ting and dancing, with &s;uch mu&s;ic as is commonly u&s;ed on public rejoicing: but previous to this, the mat|rimonial ceremony takes place, which is thus performed: the lovers are &s;eated cro&s;slegged on the ground, directly oppo&s;ite one to the other, their knees touching each other; this done, the fathers of the young couple come forward with a blanket in their hands, which they gently place over the young candidates, then the mul|titude form a circle round them, to which the parents al&s;o join; then after a &s;mall &s;pace the two fathers come to the young couple, and taking hold of the two oppo&s;ite corners of the blanket utter a few &s;ignificant words, as, we wi&s;h you joy, 'tis our wi&s;h that you may live long and peaceably together; that your offspring may be numerous; that you may be an honor to your nation; that your children may by good citizens, and that their children may al&s;o honor their country, &s;up|port its rights, and inviolately hand down their nation|al priviledges to the future ri&s;ing generations. The blanket then drops, the fathers join the encircled multi|tude; then the mothers approach the happy couple, and rai&s;e the two oppo&s;ite corners of the blanket, un|touched by their hu&s;bands, and in language &s;imilar to that delivered by their hu&s;bands, for a moment addre&s;s the young and ri&s;ing hopes of their family honor; this done, the mothers join the multitude, when a dance, honored with the national mu&s;ic, concludes the ceremony. The male and his female conforming to
<PB N="141" REF="038422_0136_1011EACB1A9B8600">
this mode, are now and ever after, &s;o long as they live con&s;idered as man and wife.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens that the propo&s;ed couple are de&s;titute of parents; in this ca&s;e four per&s;ons, con&s;i&s;ting of an equal number of both &s;exes, are by the propo&s;ed couple &s;elected, and on the matrimonial ceremony, ap|pear and act the part a&s;&s;igned the parents on the &s;ame occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Polygamy is here tolerated, and every time the male wi&s;hes to add a new female to his bed, he con|&s;ents to the u&s;ual ceremonies, which are as often repeat|ed as he admits a new partner.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e families where a plurality of wives are found, there appears a perfect harmony among the fe|males, each one endeavouring to recommend her&s;elf to the good will of her lord and ma&s;ter, the hu&s;band and head of the family.</P>
<P>Adultery is not known among them; jealou&s;y there|fore, is a &s;tranger. Fornication however, is puni&s;hed thus: the female when found guilty, is by the aged matrons roughly handled, by cutting the delinquent's hair as clo&s;e as may be to the head, then &s;he is obliged to take her paramour by his right hand, and in this manner the two delinquents are drove through the village. On this occa&s;ion the populace treat them with the greate&s;t indignity, hooting and throwing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

at them, and in every contemptuous manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them as they pa&s;s. This, however, but &s;eldom happens. The female delinquent is ever after treated by her friends and acquaintance with neglect.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as may be after a young couple are married, the whole nation a&s;&s;emble, and clear a certain piece of land a&s;&s;igned them by the chiefs for their future improvement. The trees &s;tanding on this land, wheth|er large or &s;mall, are removed root and branch in the following manner.</P>
<P>The roots running from each tree is carefully &s;epa|rated from the trunk; then a large rope,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rope is made of the rhine of a tree called white-wood.</NOTE> &s;ufficiently long and &s;trong, is fixed near the centre of the bo|dy, at each extremity of this rope a number of &s;trong, hearty pear&s;ons are placed, who by &s;trength pull down and carry off the trees until the whole piece of land is properly cleared and fit for tillage.</P>
<P>The young bride remains one year with her parents after marriage, by this time her hu&s;band recovers one crop from his patrimony.</P>
<P>The male children have names given them by the father, the females by the mother; tho&s;e names are without any &s;ignificancy, and are given merely to di&s;tingui&s;h one child from the other while in a &s;tate of

<P>Every head of a family prides him&s;elf in the num|ber of children he hath in his family; for this purpo&s;e he marries as many women as he can &s;upport by his hunting, aided by their indu&s;try and oeconomy.</P>
<P>The parents are remarkably fond of their children, e&s;pecially while in their infantile &s;tate.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. OF THEIR RELIGIOUS TENETS, MODES OF WORSHIP, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Scanyawtauragahrooote Indians hold to a plurality of Gods, as the &s;un, moon, &s;even &s;tars, north or polar &s;tar. They al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e that evil geniu&s;es, or bad &s;pirits more or le&s;s effect their national and private operations. To the &s;un, however, they give the pref|erence; ever on its ri&s;ing and &s;etting, paying homage by bowing &amp;c. towards it, in token of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive de|pendance on its power.</P>
<P>The moon and &s;tars are con&s;idered as &s;ubordinate powers, and take their authority from the &s;un. The moon on its fir&s;t appearance, whether in the wane or increa&s;e, is particularly attended to. When it fir&s;t ap|pears in its full orbit, nothing can exceed the joy which pervades the whole village&mdash;&s;houting, dancing, and every other mode of exulting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;een and heard a|mong

the inhabitants, ejaculatory prayers are intermix|ed, a&s;king the moon's intere&s;t with the &s;un, praying that he would be propitious to them, in giving them &s;ucce&s;s in hunting, tilling their lands, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;tars are con&s;idered as having rule at night in the ab&s;ence of the moon; the Indians therefore, pray that they would u&s;e their influence with the &s;un as &s;u|preme; that he would ha&s;ten the return of the moon, continue its lu&s;tre and influence longer than at one time heretofore; that the &s;tars would pre&s;ide over their traps, give &s;ucce&s;s to their endeavours to catch the Beaver, Fox, Wolfe, and all other animals taken by traps during the night &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>They hold that certain evil &s;pirits have power to counteract the good influence of the &s;un, moon, &amp;c; that they can, and often do reveal &s;ecrets to the Pow|ows or praying Indians. Tho&s;e Powows are always con&s;ulted on public enterpri&s;es, &s;uch as going to war, &amp;c. The inhabitants &s;uppo&s;e the Powows hold a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e evil geniu&s;es.</P>
<P>How tho&s;e praying Indians come by this &s;ecret pow|er, I am at a lo&s;s to determine, although when among them I made all the enquiry into this matter. The man|ner of the Powow's religious operations hath already been fully de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="038422_0141_1011EADB16CAC338">The Indians appear in their religious principles to be rude, and for want of a knowledge of the &s;criptures of divine revelation, but a &s;mall remove above the bru|tal creation, not having even a faint idea of any power nece&s;&s;ary to exi&s;t before, and &s;uperior to the &s;un, moon, &amp;c. in order to create them.</P>
<P>In in&s;tances of earthquakes, heavy thunder and lightning, they &s;ay it is becau&s;e the &s;un, moon, or &s;tars are angry, becau&s;e they have omitted paying their hom|age to one or all of their deities, or have not in the be&s;t manner improved their hunting &s;ea&s;ons, or have not (through their own neglect) improved any advan|tage they have at any time gained over their enemies in battle, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If it happens that earthquakes are not &s;o often re|peated, as for the mo&s;t part is the ca&s;e among them, they &s;ay their Gods are in friend&s;hip with them, and that they have nothing to fear from their enemies, and cheerfully pa&s;s away time, not even entertaining any notion of a &s;tate of future rewards or puni&s;hment; but that death puts an end to the difficulties attendant on this life; that the hunter &s;hall no more be obliged to travel &s;o far, and &s;uffer &s;o much as he now does in pro|curing food, &amp;c. for him&s;elf and family; that the &s;tate on which they enter at the clo&s;e of this life, is every way better calculated to make them happy; that good

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. OF THEIR DISEASES&punc; METHOD&punc; OF CURE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN general, Indians are healthy, and are but &s;eldom vi&s;ited by the Doctor.&mdash;Many di&s;ea&s;es to which tho&s;e nations are incident, who pride them&s;elves in being cal|led civilized, are not known among the Indians, and ev|er will be &s;trangers with them &s;o long as luxury and &s;loth are not introduced into that uncivilized country; however, the many hard&s;hips and fatigues they endure in hunting, or war; their being expo&s;ed to the inclem|ency of the changing &s;ea&s;ons; their often fa&s;ting and gratifying their appetites whenever a plenty of food tempts them, with many other incidental cau&s;es, often bring on a variety of di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as pains of the head, &s;tomach, and limbs; but the mo&s;t prevalent di&s;order to which they in general are incident, is the pleuri&s;y or pulmonick fever.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="038422_0143_1011EADFC1B4C480">In ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s and pain, they always apply to the old experienced &s;quaws, who are their doctors.&mdash;In the pleuri&s;y the fir&s;t trial the &s;quaw makes to remove the di&s;order, is to bleed the patient; this is done nearly in the &s;ame manner as performed by doctors in this country, which is by winding a &s;mall cord round the patient's arm above the elbow, and opening a vein by a &s;harp flint. This is done in a ma&s;terly manner, my|&s;elf having been operated upon &s;everal times during my tarry with them. The doctor then proceeds to a &s;u|doriffic mode of cure (if phlebotomy does not effect a cure) which is thus performed; a number of &s;takes are drove into the ground, forming a &s;pace &s;ufficiently large as to contain one body only, with the nece&s;&s;ary furni|ture, &amp;c. Tho&s;e &s;takes are &s;et &s;o clo&s;ely together, as by weaving in between them certain pliable twigs, air is totally excluded above as on all &s;ides. Into this en|clo&s;ure two large rocks, previou&s;ly made very hot are placed; on to tho&s;e rocks water is frequently thrown: the patient at the &s;ame time being confined within this enclo&s;ure, here tarries for one hour, which brings on a free and plentiful per&s;piration; in this &s;tate the patient plunges him&s;elf into cold water &s;o deep as at once to cover his whole body.</P>
<P>This method, however incon&s;i&s;tent it may appear to practitioners in this country, is invariably u&s;ed by the female practitioners among the Indians, and is &s;aid to be
<PB N="149" REF="038422_0144_1011EAE2EE64C908">
in general &s;ucce&s;sful, when followed by internal medic|inal decoctions of herbs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Drop&s;ical and paralytical complaints are rarely (if ever) known among them. Wounds made in war, or by any other accident, are frequent with them; in &s;uch ca&s;es the &s;quaws act the &s;urgeon's part, who by external applications of herbs and roots, &s;pontaneou&s;ly growing with them, and familiarly known to the &s;urgeons, are applied, and never fail of a perfect cure. The method of cure in the bite of the Rattle Snake hath been de&s;cri|bed in the memoirs.</P>
<P>Sometimes the patient &s;uppo&s;es that his di&s;order ari&s;eth from the malice of evil &s;pirits; in this ca&s;e the Powows are con&s;ulted&punc; who enquire in their u&s;ual way of the cau&s;e and mode of cure, which is by the phy&s;icians particularly attended to.</P>
<P>All the phy&s;icians' and &s;urgeons' pre&s;criptions, are founded on their knowledge of &s;imples only, which are taught them by long experience and indefatigable at|tention to their operations.</P>
<P>The females in the hour of nature's &s;truggle, meet with but little or no difficulty, being always delivered alone, and without the aid of any one of her female friends, or any other per&s;on. This to &s;ome may ap|pear a fal&s;e repre&s;entation, but however &s;trange, 'tis perfectly true.</P>

take care of and guide the children he may leave in a &s;tate of minority and dependance. To his family he gives council and directions how they ought to conduct them&s;elves to gain the good will of the nation, and to gain the approbation of their national Deities; that they mu&s;t con&s;ider them&s;elves as about to act (each one according to the &s;tation of life in which they are placed) with equal fidelity and honor the part that he, their father, hath before them acted, both as a good hunter and &s;ucce&s;sful warrior; that in all their conduct they mu&s;t keep their national honor in view, ever &s;ac|rificing their own private intere&s;ts for the public good, whenever called thereto. He then addre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf to his intimates pre&s;ent; tells them that a retro&s;pec|tive view of his and their conduct, when called to war; their fortitude, &s;trength and &s;kill in directing the ar|row, in handling the tru&s;ty firelock, and never failing tomahawk, gives him peculiar &s;atisfaction; that his own conduct while in active life, will entitle him to a free and &s;ure pa&s;&s;port at death, into a country far better than the country they now enjoy; that in that country, hunting is continued through the twelve moons; that the be&s;t of game is always to be had without any fatigue or di&s;appointment to the hunter, or his tru&s;ty dogs; bids his friends &s;trictly to adhere to the whole&s;ome and well fabricated rules, calculated to &s;upport their national honor, as handed down by their fathers; that they al&s;o mu&s;t hand them down to their

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE SCANYAWTAURA|GAHROOOTE INDIANS.</HEAD>
<P>IN all civilized nations, oppo&s;ite characters are to be found. Some appear mild and calm on every occa&s;ion: nothing however gloomy or terrifying to others hath any ill effect on them: others appear in every circum|&s;tance
<PB N="154" REF="038422_0149_1011EAF4088B2628">
of life unea&s;y, churli&s;h and di&s;contented, whether in pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, nothing appears to plea&s;e them, even the occurrences of common Providence di&s;affects them; at times they are ready to &s;ay that &s;uch and &s;uch events are the re&s;ult of wrong calculations. Such characters are to be met with in all orders of men. The farmer will frequently di&s;cover this by &s;aying the &s;ea&s;on is too wet or too dry, too hot or too cold; if in the winter, they &s;ay (if the &s;ea&s;on be favourable for bu&s;ine&s;s) that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy; if the &s;ea&s;on be otherwi&s;e, they &s;ay my cat|tle are eating my provender without any profit, &amp;c. This complaining &s;pirit appears to prevail more or le&s;s among people who pretend to an uncommon &s;hare of philo&s;ophic knowledge: but among the Indians who have not the advantage of education, this &s;pirit does not appear &s;o much to prevail.</P>
<P>The character of an Indian, is a compound of fe|rocity and gentlene&s;s; they are at once led away by pa&s;&s;ion, &amp; at the &s;ame time po&s;&s;e&s;s virtues that would do honor to people of more refined ta&s;te: they will di&s;cov|er a mo&s;t diabolical temper in executing &s;uch pri&s;oners as are de&s;tined to &s;uffer, at the &s;ame time will &s;hew all the compa&s;&s;ion and tenderne&s;s in their power towards tho&s;e who&s;e happy lot it is to be &s;elected from the num|ber of pri&s;oners, and are adopted by tho&s;e &s;quaws who have lo&s;t their friends in battle. Such in&s;tances I have known when among them; no pains are omitted that
<PB N="155" REF="038422_0150_1011EAF7092B4E28">
are nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;uch per&s;ons as happy as Indian accommodations can afford.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf have experienced much of their kindne&s;s, although not taken in battle; yet as a &s;tranger, both in &s;ickne&s;s and in health. They u&s;ed every mean in their power to mitigate my &s;orrows on my fir&s;t arrival a|mong them.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed their &s;pirit of re&s;entment, whenever their honor is touched. They never pa&s;s by an affront with impunity; but will watch night and day in &s;ome &s;ecret place, near which the offender is likely to pa&s;s, and all this without food or even &s;leep for two days and nights together; and will make their way through pathle&s;s de&s;erts, with no other &s;u&s;tenance than what accidentally falls in their way, to be reven|ged on an enemy.</P>
<P>Whenever the father of a family is called to be ab|&s;ent from his family for any great length of time, on his return he is not unmindful of his connubial and paren|tal feelings, but with open heart and unfolded arms meets his family, and with a degree of unaffected &s;atis|faction receives the congratulations of them on his &s;afe return to his wigwam; will entertain them with a par|ticular recital of all the events that have taken place during his ab&s;ence, whether for or again&s;t him, and with a &s;atisfaction no le&s;s plea&s;ing, will he attend to a
<PB N="156" REF="038422_0151_1011EAF896F3ABE0">
recital made by his wife and children of tho&s;e events that took place among them during his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed an Indian's attachment to his nation, on all occa&s;ions when called to council or to battle. When public honor or intere&s;t is at &s;take, the whole take the alarm, and act as if actuated by one &s;oul. All private intere&s;t is con&s;idered as of no weight when compared to national honor.</P>
<P>Being accu&s;tomed to hard&s;hips from their youth, they will &s;urmount every ob&s;tacle however hazardous; even the near pro&s;pect of death will not abate their zeal when about to execute the commands of their leaders, whether in battle with their enemies or in hunting.</P>
<P>It frequently happens that in their long marches, provi&s;ion falls &s;hort with them; in this ca&s;e not a mur|muring word is heard among them: the plea&s;ing pro&s;|pect they entertain of &s;ucce&s;s in their enterpri&s;e allays the calls of nature. This they will endure for &s;ome days, unle&s;s relieved by taking &s;ome game which pre|&s;ents when on their march, for they never turn a&s;ide from their propo&s;ed route, but keep as &s;trait and direct a cour&s;e towards the de&s;tined place as po&s;&s;ible, however great the calls of nature may be.</P>
<P>I have known them on &s;uch marches to be &s;o far reduced for want of food, that they have been obliged to eat reptiles, frogs, &amp;c. and that in a raw &s;tate; &s;ome|times
<PB N="157" REF="038422_0152_1011EAFD789CDFC8">
for want of this un&s;avoury food, they will de|vour the leaves and rind of trees as they pa&s;s along.</P>
<P>The Indians are remarkably generous to &s;trangers who vi&s;it them, whether on public bu&s;ine&s;s or acciden|tal; the be&s;t of their food is unre&s;ervedly &s;et before them, and they are bid a cordial welcome to every con|venience in the power of the family to help them to to allay their hunger, or to gratify their pa&s;&s;ions dur|ing their tarry, whether longer or &s;horter.</P>
<P>The foregoing relation of the different prevailing pa&s;&s;ions reigning in the brea&s;t of the Scanyawtauragah|rooote Indians mu&s;t &s;uffice to give the reader an idea of their character.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF THE QUADRUPEDS, BIRDS, FISHES, REPTILES AND INSECTS, WHICH ARE TO BE MET WITH ON, AND IN THE VICINITY OF SCANYAWTAURAGAH|ROOOTE ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P>OF the&s;e I &s;hall treat in alphabetical order; and fir&s;t of the quadrupeds, Bear, Beaver, Buffalo, Cat of the Mountain, or Wild Cat, Deer, Dog, Fox, Hare, Hedgehog or Porcupine, Marten, Mink, Moo&s;e, Mu&s;k|qua&s;h, Mou&s;e, Mole, Otter, Porcupine, Rabbit, Rac|coon, Skunk, Squirrel, Tiger, Wea&s;el, Woodebuck and Wolf.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="038422_0153_1011EB00BA568A30">Bears are to be found in great plenty in this, as well as in many other parts of America. The hunting of this animal is much attended to for food, clothing and bedding: the fle&s;h is e&s;teemed the fir&s;t of any to be found in the wilderne&s;s, both for its flavour and mild|ne&s;s. What adds much to recommend this diet, is, that it never cloys; a per&s;on making a meal of it one day may feed heartily upon it the next, and &s;o on (if to be obtained) for one month or longer. Such is its &s;a|lubrious quality, that it is highly recommended by practitioners to the invalid, as it &s;its ea&s;y on the &s;tom|ach, and of ea&s;y dige&s;tion. With the inhabitants of the interior parts of New-England 'tis much prized, as it &s;upplies them, when &s;alted, with meat but little inferi|or to pork. With the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, where pork cannot be procured, 'tis of the fir&s;t con&s;equence, for in a plen|tiful &s;upply they are enabled to execute plans the mo&s;t arduous among them. Among the Indians 'tis of no le&s;s con&s;equence; their method of &s;moking meat (as hath already been de&s;cribed) &s;erves to pre&s;erve large quantities of this food for &s;upply, when hunting &s;ea|&s;ons are over.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of the Bear is al&s;o of value among the In|dians, as their beds and &s;ome part of their clothing con|&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e &s;kns. The fat is much u&s;ed by the In|dians; they frequently rub it over their bodies, e&s;pecial|ly over their limbs; to this they attribute their agility. Bear's gree&s;e is u&s;ed by them to facilitate the growth of the hair on their heads.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="038422_0154_1011EB03CC326020">This animal is &s;o well known in this country, that a minute de&s;cription of its bulk or colour when fully grown, or when in a young &s;tate, is here needle&s;s; however, I would ob&s;erve that this much valued ani|mal produces but two Cubs at a litter, and but once in one &s;ea&s;on, which is not &s;o with &s;ome other quadrupeds of this we&s;tern continent. And what is particularly noticed of the Bear, is, that during the winter it re&s;ts in its &s;afe retreat in a dormant &s;tate. On its fir&s;t taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it is careful to &s;top or plug up the mo&s;t material outlet of its body, with a certain gum or gluy &s;ub&s;tance taken from the pine or hemlock tree. In this &s;tate they are often found with one of its hind paws in its mouth, and what is worthy of note, the Bear is then the fatte&s;t and mo&s;t profitable to the hunter.</P>
<P>The Beaver is an amphibious animal, and delights much in water: they are to be found and caught in or near this element.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid and publi&s;hed on the &s;ingular qualities of this valuable animal, and if rational or thinking qualities may with propriety be con&s;idered as making a part of a quadruped's inherent faculties, the Beaver fir&s;t claims the right; for, as hath in this work been already noticed, they are by &s;ome authors &s;aid to be in a &s;tate of republicani&s;m; having my&s;elf been an eye witne&s;s to their manner of con&s;tructing their dams, which with peculiar plea&s;ure I often attended to by

moonlight (when with the Indians) for they are mo&s;t indu&s;trious by night as well as by day, unle&s;s interrup|ted by &s;ome accident, or by the near approach of &s;ome more fatal enemy.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t movement (after collecting a &s;ufficient number for the purpo&s;e) is to find out and determine upon &s;ome convenient place as well for con&s;tructing their habitations as for food; this mu&s;t be a &s;mall rivu|let, &s;urrounded with a plenty of timber &s;uitable to build a dam from &s;hore to &s;hore to &s;top the running water; this being unanimou&s;ly determined upon by the com|munity, each citizen hath his particular part a&s;&s;igned him to act, whether as a labourer, an over&s;eer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who act in this office, are very attentive to their bu&s;ine&s;s, for when any who are employed to fall trees, &amp;c. are idle (for this &s;ometimes happens) an over&s;eer with his tail will correct the idler, which is done to &s;o good a purpo&s;e that the bu&s;ine&s;s goes on with more life; the idler on being corrected, more clo&s;ely attends to his part of duty.</NOTE> or in the more important office of councillor.</P>
<P>All the prerequi&s;ites being adju&s;ted, the bu&s;ine&s;s commences, and is conducted by the &s;tricte&s;t rules of in|du&s;try and oeconomy. The younger and more robu&s;t, who&s;e teeth are be&s;t calculated to perform the wood|cutter's part, a&s;&s;emble round the handie&s;t trees; to each a &s;ufficient number is placed as can work without in|terruption. They are careful to gnaw the tree &s;o as that
<PB N="161" REF="038422_0156_1011EB0A2A8DD838">
it may fall towards the rivulet. As &s;oon as the tree is fallen, they, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, take an exact mea&s;ure of the di&s;tance from &s;hore to &s;hore; the trunk of the tree is then mea&s;ured, and at a &s;uitable length is gnawed off; when others are employed to carry the prepared timber to its place of depo&s;it. The wood-cutters go on to prepare more timber as above related.</P>
<P>Their manner of draging timber is by their tails thus, a &s;uitable number for the purpo&s;e place their tails all on one &s;ide of the timber, while others on the oppo|&s;ite &s;ide gently role the timber on to the prepared vehi|cles; thus fixed, the timber is drawn forward to the &s;pot, and there placed. They proceed in the &s;ame manner until a number &s;ufficient for their purpo&s;e is drawn on and placed; then a number appear and act the ma&s;on's part, who with their tails as with a trowel pla&s;ter on between the timber, interwoven with &s;mall branches of the felled trees&mdash;the morter u&s;ed is prepar|ed by the Beaver's feet. They al&s;o carry upon their tails rocks of very con&s;iderable weight, further to &s;trengthen their dams.</P>
<P>Having completely &s;toped the running water, they then proceed to form their cabins, or lodging places; the&s;e are con&s;tructed in an oval form, and are built either on piles by them formed in the pond above the Beaver dam, or on the extremity of &s;ome point of land running into the pond. The greater part of the cabin
<PB N="162" REF="038422_0157_1011EB0D0CDCC920">
&s;tands above the water. Each cabin is &s;o large as to contain a number of inhabitants; each one hath a particular &s;pot a&s;&s;igned it, the floor of which is &s;trewed over with leaves or &s;mall branches of pine trees. Their cabins are &s;o nearly &s;ituated, that an ea&s;y communica|tion is kept up between them. The floor of the cabin is &s;o con&s;tructed that the innermo&s;t part is &s;ix or eight inches higher than at the entrance; the Beaver then in laying down keeps his body dry, while his tail is kept in the water, for it mu&s;t be kept wet, otherwi&s;e the animal is &s;ickly. The manner of the Beaver's laying down in his cabin, accounts for this animal's knowing that &s;ome breach is made in the dam, which, as hath been de&s;cribed, gives the hunter an opportunity of catch|ing his game; for when the water is drawn off, the an|imal's tail is dry, which gives its owner a re&s;tle&s;s feeling, and increa&s;eth to &s;uch a degree as to cau&s;e the Beaver to ri&s;k his life in &s;earching out the cau&s;e, and in repair|ing the breach.</P>
<P>Their habitations are completed by the latter end of September, and their &s;tock of provi&s;ion to &s;erve them through the winter is provided. Their provi&s;ion con|&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall pieces of wood who&s;e texture is &s;oft, &s;uch as puplar, willow, &amp;c. which they lay up in piles in &s;uch a manner as to pre&s;erve their moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>The Beaver being an animal but &s;eldom &s;een but by tho&s;e who hunt them, I &s;hall here de&s;cribe it. The
<PB N="163" REF="038422_0158_1011EB0E9C483FE8">
large&s;t are nearly four feet in length, and about fifteen inches over the haunches; they weigh, one with anoth|er, when fully grown, about fifty-five or &s;ixty pounds. Its head re&s;embles that of the Otter&mdash;its &s;nout is long&mdash; the eyes &s;mall&mdash;the ears &s;hort, round, hairy on the out|&s;ide and &s;mooth within&mdash;its teeth very long; the under ones &s;tand out of their mouths about one inch, the upper teeth about one fourth of an inch; all are broad, &s;trong and &s;harp; the under teeth before, are formed like a carpenter's gouge, and &s;eem peculiarly formed to fall trees, &amp;c&mdash;their fore legs are &s;horter than their hind ones&mdash;their toes in the fore feet are &s;eparate, each toe furni&s;hed with a nail&mdash;its hind feet are furni&s;hed with membranes, which join their toes much like unto the feet of water fowl, thus prepared it can &s;wim with as much ea&s;e as any other aquatic animal. The tail in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embles that of a fi&s;h, and &s;eems to have no relation to any other part of the body, except the hind feet, all the o|ther parts being &s;imilar to other land animals. The tail is about twelve inches in length, and about four inches broad in the middle, the root and its extremity being much narrower; 'tis about two inches thick near the body, where it is almo&s;t round, but gradually thinner and flatter towards the end, 'tis covered over with &s;cales like unto tho&s;e of fi&s;h. The colour of the Beaver differs according to the different climates where they are found. In the northern parts they are almo&s;t black&mdash;in the more temperate climate, brown. Their colour grows lighter as they approach towards the &s;outh.
<PB N="164" REF="038422_0159_1011EB1148154A48">
Their fur is of two &s;orts, all over the body, except the feet&mdash;the longe&s;t is about one inch and of no value, the other part is a very thick and fine down, almo&s;t as &s;oft as &s;ilk; this &s;ort is much u&s;ed in the hatter's bu&s;ine&s;s, &amp;c. The Ca&s;tor is found in this animal, and is of peculiar u&s;e in certain di&s;orders, and of no &s;mall profit to the hunter.</P>
<P>The Buffalo is found in the greate&s;t perfection and plenty in this quarter, and of great con&s;equence to the Scanyawtauragahrooote Indians; it is much larger than a common Ox&mdash;has &s;hort black horns, with a large beard under its chin; his head is &s;o full of hair that it falls over its eyes, which gives a di&s;agreeable appearance. This animal is di&s;tingui&s;hed from others by a large bunch on its back, beginning at the haunches, increa&s;|ing gradually to the &s;houlders and neck. The whole body is covered with long hair of a dun or mou&s;e colour &mdash;its head is larger than a Bull's, with a very &s;hort neck&mdash; the brea&s;t is broad&mdash; the body decrea&s;eth towards its rump.&mdash;The Buffalo's fle&s;h is excellent food&mdash;its hide very u&s;eful&mdash;its hair much u&s;ed in manufacturing many articles.</P>
<P>Cat of the Mountain, or Wild Cat, in &s;hape much re|&s;embles our common hou&s;e Cat, but much larger. Their whole &s;kin is beautified with black &s;pots&mdash;the hair which covers the body, in general, is of a redi&s;h ca&s;t. This animal is very fierce, and will engage animals of
<PB N="165" REF="038422_0160_1011EB15471E53A0">
&s;uperior bulk, and by its dexterity in u&s;ing its claws will conquer animals of &s;uperior &s;trength and agility.</P>
<P>Deer. This animal is well known in this country. They are of a deep fallow or pale colour&mdash;light on the foot, and excellent food, and are in great plenty in the un|cultivated parts of America.</P>
<P>Dogs among the Indians are numerous, and of great u&s;e and much profit as well in hunting animals of the wilderne&s;s, as in que&s;t of water fowl and other feathered game. They are early taught to follow and a&s;&s;i&s;t the hunter whenever nece&s;&s;ary. 'Tis rare to meet an In|dian in the woods without his Dog (unle&s;s when on &s;ome warlike enterprize) who is treated by his ma&s;ter with familiarity, and at all times with his benefactor &s;hares in what the wigwam affords while at ea&s;e, crouch|ing at his ma&s;ter's feet, and in hunting does not loo&s;e his &s;hare of the game.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed the attachment and fidelity of the Dog to his owner on all occa&s;ions by night as well as by day.</P>
<P>The Indian Dogs appear to be of one &s;pecies, in tho&s;e, the qualities of the Spaniel, the Grey-Hound, the Ma&s;tiff, the Bull-Dog, the Fox-Hunter, and the Blood-Hound,
<PB N="166" REF="038422_0161_1011EB17165214B0">
&s;o much prized in European nations, &s;eem to unite in forming one complete Indian Dog, who&s;e head as well as the other parts of his body as nearly re&s;embles that of a Wolfe as any animal whatever.</P>
<P>Many anecdotes have been related of the &s;agacity and fidelity of a Dog to his ma&s;ter; among a variety, I &s;hall &s;elect one only.</P>
<P>"In one of the we&s;tern forts within the limits of the United States, an American officer, accompanied by his tru&s;ty Dog only, left the fort in que&s;t of &s;ome &s;mall game, having travelled &s;ome way into the woods was met by two Indians, who knocked the officer down and &s;calped him; the Dog was not noticed by the Indians, who, after the enemy had left his ma&s;ter, licked the wound, and tarried by the body for &s;ome time, often repeating his friendly aid, at length di&s;covering &s;ome motion in the mangled body, the Dog (as though he knew that &s;ome further a&s;&s;i&s;tance was nece&s;&s;ary to compleat a cure) ran to the fort; &s;ome officers at that time walking at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the parade, the Dog run up to them fawning round them, and running from them towards the place where lay his ma&s;ter's almo&s;t lifele&s;s body. The officers at fir&s;t but little noticed him, but upon the Dog's repeating the &s;ame, they followed the friendly animal, who led them to the wounded man. The offi|cers
<PB N="167" REF="038422_0162_1011EB1B1740CDF8">
carried the body to the fort, where, by proper ap|plication the maimed officer &s;oon recovered his wonted health, and afterwards became an ornament to the American heroes."</P>
<P>The Fox, Hare, Marten, Mole, Mink, Mu&s;kqua&s;h, or Water-Rat, Mou&s;e, Rabbit, Squirrel, Skunk, Wea&s;el and Woodchuck are &s;o well known in almo&s;t every part of the United States, that a particular de&s;cription in this book mu&s;t be needle&s;s; I therefore &s;hall pa&s;s them over and proceed in the propo&s;ed order to de&s;cribe &s;uch as are commonly found in the Indian country, and are &s;trangers to this part of America.</P>
<P>The Hedgehog and Porcupine &s;o nearly re&s;emble each other that in de&s;cribing one the reader may form an idea of the other, although by &s;ome con&s;idere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as two di&s;tinct animals. It is about the bulk of a &s;mall Dog, but of &s;horter legs; its body is covered with hair of a dark brown, and armed with quills on almo&s;t every part of the body; tho&s;e on its back are mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tan|tial. Tho&s;e quills are this animal's defen&s;ive and of|fen&s;ive weapons, which at plea&s;ure he di&s;charges at his enemy. Whenever they enter the fle&s;h in any degree, they will &s;ink into it, and are not to be extracted but by inci&s;ion. The Indians make u&s;e of the&s;e quills in boring their ears and no&s;es to in&s;ert their pendants,
<PB N="168" REF="038422_0163_1013D2AFC9E67450">
and al&s;o as ornaments to their &s;tockings, moga&s;ons, hair, &amp;c; their fle&s;h is e&s;teemed by the Indians.</P>
<P>The Moo&s;e by &s;ome is &s;aid to be of the Deer kind, but on a clo&s;e examination 'tis found to be an animal of a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from the Deer, both in its bulk and particular formation; the Deer being gant and of a &s;lender body, long leged and light on the foot&mdash;its horns long, &s;lender, round and branching. The Moo&s;e is in body nearly of the bulk of a well fed hor&s;e, its legs &s;hor|ter and more &s;tockey&mdash;its horns near the ba&s;e are nearly round and large, as they expand, more flat and le&s;s branching. This animal &s;heds his horns annually&mdash;its hair is of a light grey, with a &s;mall mixture of blacki&s;h red&mdash;the tail very &s;hort&mdash;its fle&s;h is good food, nour|i&s;hing and ea&s;y of dige&s;tion; the upper lip when prop|erly cook'd is much e&s;teemed&mdash;its hide is very proper for leather, being thick, &s;trong, &s;oft and pliable. The Moo&s;e never appears when in motion, but on a trot. This animal is rarely to be met with on or near the Scanyawtauragahrooote I&s;land, its haunts being much further north&mdash;its food through the winter is the buds and mo&s;s of trees.</P>
<P>The Otter is an amphibious animal, and much re|&s;embles the Beaver in its head and fore parts of the body&mdash;its teeth are &s;haped more like a Fox or Wolf.

The Otter's hair is much longer than that of the Bea|ver, and of a greyi&s;h ca&s;t. This animal is to be met with in almo&s;t all parts of uncultivated America, is mi&s;chievous, and if clo&s;ely pur&s;ued will attack men as well as dogs&mdash;in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on it feeds on fi&s;h, during the winter 'tis content with the bark of trees, &amp;c &mdash;its fle&s;h is of a fi&s;hy ta&s;te and &s;mell, and is not eaten but in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Raccoon. This animal is &s;omething &s;maller than a Beaver&mdash;its legs &s;horter&mdash;its head is much like a Fox &mdash;its ears &s;horter, more round and naked&mdash;its hair is thick, long and &s;oft, intermixed with a &s;ort of fur, which is of great u&s;e to the hatter&mdash;on its face a broad &s;tripe of white runs acro&s;s it which includes the eyes, which are large&mdash;the teeth are &s;imilar to a Dog's in &s;hape and number&mdash;the tail is long and round, with annular &s;tripes on it&mdash;the feet have five long &s;lender toes, each armed with a &s;harp claw by which they with ea&s;e climb trees into the extremity of the boughs&mdash;it u&s;es its fore feet like the Squirrel to feed it&s;elf&mdash;its fle&s;h in autumn, after being fattened on nuts, &amp;c. eats very good, and is much valued by the hunters in that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Tiger. This is an animal much &s;hunned by the Indians, as they are ravenous and of no con&s;equence when caught by the hunter; they are much in form like the Wolfe, armed with claws, long and very

&s;harp; their hair is of a darki&s;h fallow, and entirely free from &s;pots&mdash;they &s;ecreet them&s;elves under the cover of &s;ome thick bu&s;hes, and on the near approach of &s;ome animal or hunter, &s;uddenly leaps from his re|treat, &s;eizes its prey, which falls a &s;acrifice; for from the Tiger's claws there is no e&s;cape; tho&s;e animals are but rarely met with, which the Indians e&s;teem as one of the greate&s;t favours.</P>
<P>Wolf. This animal by &s;ome is called the wild Dog, and much re&s;embles him in its form; they are however much longer bodied and longer leged&mdash;their colour in general, is that of a dun or dark brown&mdash;&s;ome few are grey; whether this is owing to their great age, or is their natural hue, I am at a lo&s;s to determine. The Wolf is a great night walker, and often thins the new &s;ettler's &s;tock, as well the yearling cattle as &s;heep and lambs in the interior parts of this country. Wolves often herd together in the night, which is generally known in the vicinity of their re&s;ort, by the hideous yellings the Wolves are careful rarely to omit.</P>

<P>Black-Bird. There are three &s;orts of birds in A|merica (that naturali&s;ts) di&s;tingui&s;h under this name, viz. the Crow Black-Bird, which is of the large&s;t &s;ize, and builds its ne&s;t on high trees, inacce&s;&s;able to boys in que&s;t of bird's eggs; of this kind there are a great plenty; in autumn they are &s;een in large flocks, and greatly infe&s;t cornfields, and do much dam|age by robbing the indu&s;trious farmer of the fruit of his &s;ummer's toil, unle&s;s prevented by timely pre|cautions; however, their rapacity is but of &s;hort con|tinuance, for when fro&s;t nips hard they are &s;een no more for that &s;ea&s;on; as they are birds of pa&s;&s;age, they retire to &s;ome unfrequented and more favourable cli|mate.
<PB N="172" REF="038422_0167_1013D2A91D58D140">
The &s;econd &s;ort are of a &s;maller &s;ize than the former, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed from them by the name of the Red-Wing Black-Bird, having the whole of its body covered with black feathers, except on the lower edge of its wings, which is of a bright &s;carlet&mdash;this &s;ort build their ne&s;t on low bu&s;hes, on or near &s;wampy ground, their eggs are comeattible by boys, which ac|counts for their &s;carcity when compared with the Crow Black-Bird. They are not (either &s;ort) prized for their &s;ongs. The third and la&s;t &s;ort are much &s;maller than either of the former, and are of a jet black, except a &s;mall part of white on its head and back&mdash;this &s;ort build their ne&s;ts on the ground, and u&s;e a few warbling notes. The female is of a brown colour and is not a &s;inger.</P>
<P>The Humming bird is peculiar to America, and is not known in any other part of the globe; 'tis the &s;mal|le&s;t of the feathered airy inhabitants&mdash;its legs are pro|portionally &s;mall to its body, and are not biger than two &s;mall needles&mdash;its plumage exceeds de&s;cription&mdash;it has a &s;mall tuft on its head of a &s;hining black&mdash;its brea&s;t is red&mdash;the belly white&mdash;the back, wings and tail a pale green&mdash;&s;mall &s;pecks of a gold ca&s;t are &s;cattered over the whole body&mdash;an almo&s;t imperceptible down &s;oftens the colours, and produces the mo&s;t plea&s;ing

&s;hades&mdash;with its bill, which is proportionably &s;mall to its body, it extracts moi&s;ture from flowers, which is its nouri&s;hment; over which it hovers like a Bee, without lighting, con&s;tantly moving its wings with &s;uch veloci|ty, that the motion is imperceptible; this quick motion cau&s;eth a humming noi&s;e, from whence it receives its name.</P>
<P>The Wacon-Bird is nearly the &s;ize of the &s;wallow, of a brown colour, &s;haded about the neck with a bright green; the wings are of a darker brown than the body &mdash;its tail is compo&s;ed of four or five feathers beautifully &s;haded with green and purple, and is three times as long as its body, it carries this length of plumage in the &s;ame manner as the Peacock does, but does not rai&s;e it into an erect po&s;ition&mdash;the name of this bird &s;ignifies the bird of the great &s;pirit, and is held in great veneration by the Indians, and treated by them as a bird of &s;uperior rank to any of the feathered race.</P>
<P>The Whet&s;aw is of the Cuckoo kind, is a &s;olitary bird, and rarely to be met with in the &s;ummer months &mdash;'tis heard in the groves; its noi&s;e &s;ounds like the whetting of a &s;aw, from whence it receives its name.</P>

<HEAD>OF SERPENTS.</HEAD>
<P>RATTLE-SNAKE, long Black-Snake, Adder, Striped-Snake, Water-Snake, Hi&s;&s;ing-Snake, Turkey-Snake, Green-Snake, Speckled-Snake, and Ring-Snake are to be met with in almo&s;t all the Indian territories.</P>
<P>As all the above mentioned &s;nakes are to be found in many parts of the United States, except the Rattle-Snake and Turkey-Snake, I &s;hall not attempt a partic|ticular de&s;cription of any except tho&s;e two.</P>
<P>Rattle-Snake. This &s;erpent is of all the &s;erpentile &s;pecies mo&s;t to be feared; its bite (if not prevented by &s;ome early and proper application) proves fatal&mdash;at its full growth 'tis about five feet in length, it mea|&s;ures round its body about eight inches, from its centre it gradually decrea&s;eth both towards its head and tail&mdash; the neck is &s;mall, the head broad and depre&s;&s;ed&mdash;they are of a brown colour&mdash;the eye appears of a bright red and very piercing&mdash;the upper part of its body of a brown, mixed with a ruddy yellow, and chequer'd with
<PB N="175" REF="038422_0170_1013D2BBB57C7D58">
many regular lines of a deep black, gradually to a gold colour&mdash;the belly is of a pale blue, which grows fuller as it approacheth its &s;ides. This &s;nake gives the trav|eller notice of his danger by &s;haking the rattles at its tail; the number denotes its age as one is added every year of its life.</P>
<P>The Turkey-Snake is about &s;ix feet in length, pro|portionally large in its body, and of a du&s;ky colour&mdash; this &s;nake takes its name from its preying upon the Wild-Turkey principally. The method of its taking the Turkey is in the manner following.</P>
<P>The &s;nake on finding a tree on which the Turkeys are wont to roo&s;t at night, a&s;cends it, to its lowe&s;t branches entwines its tail round a branch with its head downwards, draws its body into a &s;mall compa&s;s, not unlike the form of a Wa&s;p's ne&s;t. Whenever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Turkey approaches its wonted place of re&s;t, the Snake &s;u&s;pended as above related, with a hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e draws a Turkey directly under its enemy, who, as by a charm &s;eizes its deluded prey, entwines its body round the Turkey's neck, robs it of life, then with its tongue licks every part of the bird, which leaves a certain gluey &s;ub&s;tance that &s;erves to lubricate the body &s;o that the &s;nake &s;wallows the bird with more ea&s;e; thus prepared the &s;erpent takes it by the head and gradually &s;ucks in the body with its feathers, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="038422_0171_1013D2C6D6010E80">In&s;ects, Lizards, &amp;c. are of the &s;ame kind and qualities as in this country.</P>
<P>TREES as well tho&s;e of high land as low, are there found in as great plenty in that country as in this part of America, and as great a variety, but in general of a larger growth.</P>
<P>The &s;oil appears more rich in the Indian country than in any part of the United States, at lea&s;t in &s;uch parts as I have travelled, the height and bulk of the trees clearly evinces this.</P>
<P>Roots, plants and flowers appear of the &s;ame form and quality as in New-England, but of a &s;pontaneous growth.</P>
<P>Indian corn, or maize. Beans and &s;qua&s;hes are the only food cultivated by the Scanyawtauragahrooote Indians.</P>
