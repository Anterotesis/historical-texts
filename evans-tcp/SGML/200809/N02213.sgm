<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Excellent Sermon, which you have here put in|to your hands. (I'm told) met with great and due Applau&s;e from a numerous &amp; judicious Audi|ence, in the Preaching of it: and I doubt not will have equal Acceptance, in the Reading. It is a Sheaf of</HI> Fir&s;t Fruits <HI>from my worthy Brother, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Pre&s;s; and I believe will be found</HI> very good, <HI>even</HI> like the Pigs that are fir&s;t ripe, <HI>and can't fail of a &s;ingular Reli&s;h with all &s;uch as have</HI> their Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern what is good, <HI>and to</HI> approve the Things that are ex|cellent. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> at the great Importunity of &s;o many, who ta&s;ted the Sweet &amp; Benefit of it in the Hearing, for a further Pub|lication thereof, an order to many others having a &s;hare with them. I'm per&s;uaded the governing Aim of the Author in this Di&s;cour&s;e was to give GOD the Glory of His &s;urpri&s;ing Goodne&s;s &amp; Wi&s;dom in the Method He has cho&s;en, of in&s;tructing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> People by</HI> Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions <HI>with Them&s;elves, and to lead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a ju&s;t &amp; pious Appli|cation of a</HI> Thought, <HI>which it may be has &s;eldom and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but Few had its proper Weight &amp; Improvement. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ble&s;s GOD, who directed His Servant to &s;uch a Text, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the&s;e Meditations upon it, and di&s;po&s;'d him to give '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m the Publick&mdash;It is not the de&s;ign of this Preface to enter into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Reverend Auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, or give a Recommendation of his Performance.

The Preacher &s;ought out acceptable Words, faithful Sayings, and worthy of all Acceptation. <HI>Here we have a Variety of the wi&s;e&s;t Le&s;&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e'd to us; many ju&s;t &amp; &s;ea&s;onable Caveats &amp; Ad|monitions given; with weighty &amp; moving Exhortations; which if well entertained &amp; apply'd, wou'd be of no common &s;ervice, to pro|mote the great Intere&s;ts of Religion, the De&s;igns of the Evangelical Mini&s;try.&mdash;And here al&s;o we are taught how to make u&s;e of this Subject for our</HI> Con&s;olation <HI>in &s;everal Ca&s;es. Here Auditors are told how they may apply it to compo&s;e their Minds, to &s;it quietly under the Admini&s;trations of &s;uch as are not altogether agreeable to their Wi&s;hes. And here al&s;o Ministers are put in mind, to apply it for their Support &amp; Encouragement, under the dark Pro&s;pect of an Un|&s;ucce&s;sful Mini&s;try. An inexpre&s;&s;ible Grief this! But we mu&s;t eye the Hand of GOD in it. If we have Succe&s;s it is not to be a&s;crib'd to</HI> our own Power or Holine&s;s. <HI>For who is</HI> Paul? <HI>and who is</HI> Apollos? <HI>But Mini&s;ters by whom Men believe,</HI> even as the Lord giveth to every Man. <HI>So then neither is he that planteth,</HI> any thing; <HI>nor he that watereth: but GOD&mdash;&punc;To Him we &s;hou'd give all the Glory of our Succe&s;s. And when deny'd that, if we are</HI> faithful, <HI>we may take Comfort in this; knowing that we are but Men, Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions with others; and that with</HI> Men <HI>it is impo&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tho' (&s;uffer me to add) we &s;hou'd be very</HI> jealous of our &s;elves <HI>in this Ca&s;e, and examine &s;trictly into our own Temper &amp; Conduct; le&s;t by any means we &s;hou'd have been</HI> acce&s;&s;ory <HI>to our own Un&s;uc|ce&s;sfulne&s;s and deceive our &s;elves with a groundle&s;s Pre&s;umption of our unblamable Fidelity. Mini&s;ters are too often the faulty Cau&s;es (at lea&s;t in conjunction with their People) of their want of Succe&s;s. We are Men</HI> &s;ubject to like Pa&s;&s;ions <HI>with others. The brighte&s;t</HI> An|gels <HI>of the Churches are but Spirits</HI> in Fle&s;h; <HI>and have in them the &s;ame Principles of moral as well natural Corruption, common to others. And by their own Infirmities, They too often grieve the Holy Spirit, and provoke Him to deny His Ble&s;&s;ing on their Endeavours.

<P>THIS Chapter is a Continuation of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Barna|bas,</HI> their united Endeavours to Go&s;pellize the Pagan World.

But when <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> &s;aw the whole City in Confu&s;ion, and that there was a Murderous de&s;ign on Foot again&s;t them, then they fled into other Cities: as CHRIST Com|mandeth, or at lea&s;t alloweth his Mini&s;ters to do, Mat. 10. 23. <HI>When they per&s;ecute you in this City, then flee ye into another:</HI> And as GOD opens to them a door of E&s;cape out of one Place, &s;o he doth a door of Opportunity in another. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Bar|nabas</HI> coming to <HI>Ly&s;tra, Preached the Go&s;pel there,</HI> and wrought a Miraculous Cure for the confirmation of their Doctrine, and to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all who beheld it. A poor Cripple, who had been &s;o <HI>from his Mother's Womb,</HI> and <HI>never had walked,</HI> Hearing <HI>Paul</HI> preach, was &s;o affected with the Sermon, that he believed, the Speaker could not only &s;ay, but do great things, <HI>in the Name of Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, whom he preached.</HI> The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> looking <HI>Stedfa&s;tly</HI> and Compa&s;&s;ionately upon him, perceived by the Spirit of di&s;cerning, <HI>that he had faith to be healed.</HI> He therefore <HI>with a loud voice &s;aid</HI> unto the lame Man, <HI>Stand upright on thy feet.</HI> He doubt|le&s;s &s;aid this <HI>in the Name of Je&s;us Christ of Nazareth:</HI> The Word was &s;ent forth from him; for by it the Cripple was immediately and perfectly healed, which he di&s;covered by <HI>leaping &amp; walking.</HI> And &s;o an ancient Prophecy which relates to Go&s;pel-times, was liter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly fulfilled: I&s;a. 35. 6. <HI>Then &s;hall the lame man leap as an hart.</HI> This wonderfull work
