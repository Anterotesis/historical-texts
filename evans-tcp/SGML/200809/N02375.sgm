<P>MAY it plea&s;e Your Honour Mr. <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> and the Honourable the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> Senior, and <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> Junior, the Pri&s;oners at the Bar, &s;tand Articled again&s;t for Acts of <HI>Piracy, Robbery</HI> and <HI>Felony,</HI> Com|mitted upon the High Seas, within the Juri&s;diction of the Admiralty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> contrary to the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, His Crown and Dignity, and the Statutes in &s;uch Ca&s;es Made and Provided: To which upon Arraignment, they have &s;everally pleaded <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>The Word <HI>Pirate,</HI> with incon&s;iderable Variation, is taken from the <HI>Greek</HI> Sub&s;tantive <HI>Peirates, Praedo Marinus,</HI> and therefore a Pirate in a Legal Sen&s;e is called a <HI>Robber on the High Seas</HI>: And under this Con&s;ideration I'm humbly of Opinion, the Pri&s;oners at the Bar will evidently appear to your Honours, in the Series of this their Trial: Per&s;ons whom the Law with the greate&s;t Pro|priety ju&s;tly Terms <HI>Pirates.</HI> And however others may pride them&s;elves in accurately handling ab&s;tru&s;e and knotty Ca&s;es; I e&s;teem it my Felicity, that the Articles now exhibited to your Honours, are grounded upon plain and clear Matters of Fact; Facts which proceed from the Rancour and Virulency of their evil Hearts, from a craving Appetite, and an in&s;atiable Thir&s;t after inordinate Gain. And finally, Facts if not now timely Corrected by Your Honours experienced Ju&s;tice, will mo&s;t certainly terminate in the breaking up of our Fi&s;hery, the mo&s;t valuable Branch of our <HI>New-England</HI> Trade. But for as much as I'm &s;en&s;ible Glo&s;&s;es with your Honours pa&s;s not for Arguments, or Varni&s;h for Evidence; So I'm well a&s;&s;ured, when po&s;itive and direct Proofs appear before You in their full Proportion, they will have their U&s;ual and Legal Weight in Your Honours Determination: And therefore upon the Evidences I &s;hall produce on the part of the King, I may rea&s;onably expect in Ju&s;tice to His Maje&s;ty, in Compliance with the Laws of our Land, and in
<PB N="8" REF="002818_0007_0FE64FF798EF0E80">
a due and tender Regard to this His Maje&s;ty's Province, and the Safety and Pre&s;ervation of the Lives and Properties of His Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Loyal and Du|tiful Subjects in this Government, Your Honour and the Honourable the Commi&s;&s;ioners will adjudge the Pri&s;oners at the Bar re&s;pectively Guilty of all and every the Articles exhibited again&s;t them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

That &s;ome &s;hort time after the Deponent and his Men had left the Sloop, the &s;aid <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> called to his Son on Shoar, and &s;pake to him in a Lan|guage unknown to the Deponent, and pre&s;ently <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> Junior, with two <HI>Indians,</HI> namely, <HI>James Mews</HI> and <HI>Philip Mews,</HI> went into the &s;aid <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI>'s Can|no, and after they had got about a Gun &s;hot from the Shore, one of the <HI>Indians</HI> held up his Gun and Fired it, &amp; called to the Deponent and Company as they &s;tood on the Shoar, &s;aying, You <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, ask for Quarter; and after the <HI>Indians</HI> had got on board the Sloop, they took down the <HI>Engli&s;h En&s;ign</HI> then fly|ing, which the Deponent perceiving, he then went to the Hou&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Giddery,</HI> Mother to the &s;aid <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> and de&s;ired her, with her Son <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> to go on board the Sloop with him, and intercede with the &s;aid <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> that the Depo|nent might have his Sloop again. And after &s;ome Con&s;iderable Time, Mrs. <HI>Giddery</HI> and her Son went on board with the Deponent, when he the Deponent &s;aw the En&s;ign girded round <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI>'s middle, and a Pi&s;tol tuckt in it, which

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e Your Honour, Mr. <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Honourable Commi&s;&s;i|oners of this Court:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not without Regret that I appear before this Honourable Court in behalf of the Pri&s;oners at the Bar: But the Sen&s;e of my Duty, and my real De&s;ire that the World, and more e&s;pecially their Country men, &s;hould be convinced of the fair and impartial Trial they will receive, weigh down all Objections to my appearing for them. And although they may labour under &s;ome Inconveniences on Account of their not under&s;tanding the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, yet I take that to be &s;ufficiently made up to them, by the great Candour and Impartiality your Honours have &s;hown in granting them Interpreters and other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>As it is my Province to &s;peak only to Matters of Law, I &s;hall endeavour to perform it as well as the very little time I have had will allow; and waving any Ob&s;ervations upon the Evidences that have been Sworn, humbly beg your Honours Con&s;ideration of two Matters, which I conceive worthy thereof. The fir&s;t of which relates equally to both the Pri&s;oners, the la&s;t to <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> Junior only.</P>
<P>I am well per&s;waded there hath been a great peice of Villany lately acted in the Harbour of <HI>Malaga&s;h,</HI> by the &s;eizing and taking of Capt. <HI>Doty</HI> and his Men and Ve&s;&s;el, in which the Pri&s;oners may have borne their part, but your Honour, and the re&s;t of the Honourable Court, will well di&s;tingui&s;h Crimes of different Na|tures, and not Condemn Per&s;ons for Piracy becau&s;e they may be Guilty of No|torious Robberies or other Crimes, and I &s;ubmit it to your Honours whether the Pri&s;oners can be adjudged Guilty of Piracy. My Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale</HI> in his <HI>Plac.

And &s;ays another Book, <Q>If a Pirate en|ter a Port or Haven, and A&s;&s;aults and Robs a Merchant-Ship at Anchor there, this is no Piracy, becau&s;e it is not done <HI>Super Altum Mare,</HI> but it is a downright Robbery at the Common Law, the Act being <HI>infra Corpus Comita|tus,</HI> Jacob<HI>'s Lex Mercat.</HI> Pag. 183.</Q> <HI>Medio,</HI> both which agree with the Defini|tion of <HI>Piracy</HI> given by my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> in his Comments upon <HI>Littleton,</HI> Pag. 291. a. If then it appears to your Honours, (as I think it mu&s;t by the Evidence) that the Facts charged upon the Pri&s;oners were Committed in an Harbour within the Body of a County: And &s;uppo&s;ing they were the real Actors there|of, they are not guilty of Piracy, but ought to be tried at the Common Law, as Robbers, by a Jury, and your Honours will acquit them of the Articles now exhibited again&s;t them by the Advocate General on His Maje&s;ty's behalf.</P>

<P>Your Honours will likewi&s;e be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider the great Influences a Father hath upon his Son, not only in his Example but Precepts, as corrupt Nature is prone enough to evil; the Per&s;wa&s;ions of a Father, or the fear of his Frowns and &s;evere Corrections, back'd with his Example, are &s;trong and pow|erful In&s;tigators to do Evil.</P>

<P>Which Examination was then Interpreted by Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Lucy</HI> and <HI>Frazier,</HI> to to the &s;aid <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> who owned the &s;ame to be true.</P>
<P>Then the King's Advocate. Recapitulated the Evidences, and Replied upon the Pri&s;oner's Advocate in the following manner.</P>
<Q><P><HI>May it plea&s;e your Honours,</HI></P>
<P>THE Pri&s;oners at the Bar having nothing further to offer, nor their Ad|vocate for them, I &s;hall therefore with all po&s;&s;ible Brevity, di&s;charge
<PB N="16" REF="002818_0015_0FE6500EE2C24CD8">
the remaining part of my Duty, in clo&s;ing this Trial, that has thus long ex|exci&s;ed your Honours great Patience; and in order to this, I &s;hall in the fir&s;t Place recount the &s;everal principal Facts proved upon the Pri&s;oners, and as I humbly conceive, unque&s;tionably maintain my Charge again&s;t them, and la&s;tly con&s;ider the Defence made by their Advocate for them. The Matters of Fact appear &s;o Full and Irre&s;i&s;table, that neither the Pri&s;oners them&s;elves attempt to fal&s;ify them, or even to &s;ugge&s;t any colourable Argument for their Extenua|tion: And are &s;uch, that were they committed upon the High Sea, their Ad|vocate concedes would clearly amount to Piracy.</P>
<P>And therefore I &s;hall only &s;ummarily Mention to your Honours, that be|&s;ides the general Evidence again&s;t the Pri&s;oners, of their Aiding, A&s;&s;i&s;ting, Con|curring and A&s;&s;enting with others in the Taking, Robbing and Plundering the Sloop <HI>Tryal,</HI> mentioned in the Articles, it's proved particularly upon the Pri&s;o|ners, they were the fir&s;t that entered the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el: That <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> the Father, under a pretence of going a&s;hoar in his Son's Canno, prevailed on the Ma&s;ter to leave him aboard; and to give the greater Terror to His Maje|&s;ty's Subjects, and Aggrandize him&s;elf, he made a Sa&s;h of the En&s;ign, and there|in tuckt <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Pi&s;tol, a&s;&s;uming the Name of <HI>Skipper,</HI> ordered Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> to come to &s;ail, and to &s;teer the Sloop <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI>; and when a Scooner appeared in &s;ight, he and his Son, with others, divided the Powder and Shot belonging to the Ve&s;&s;el, new flinted their Guns, converted the Fi&s;hing-Leads into Sluggs, and therewith loaded their Small-Arms: That he helped with others to bind the Mate of &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el, and al&s;o piratically robbed <HI>Roberts</HI> of two Rings and a pair of Stockings, and was active in con&s;uming and de&s;troying the Ve&s;&s;el's Provi&s;ions and Stores.</P>
<P>The Facts proved upon <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> Junior, the other Pri&s;oner, are for the mo&s;t the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance; more e&s;pecially that he was originally let into the Secret, for when the Canno was but not half way in her return to the Sloop, then it was that a Gun was fired into the Air, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were required to cry for Quarters. That he was not only the Per&s;on confided in for bringing about their wicked De&s;igns, but that he had &s;o well executed that part that was judged the mo&s;t Tru&s;ty, that he was left to &s;tand Gentry over the Arms: That he charged his Father's Pi&s;tol; was Armed with a Gun; had on him a Cap, the Pro|perty of one of the Men belonging to the Sloop; And finally, with a Fi&s;her|man's Pew made &s;everal attempts to de&s;troy <HI>Sprague,</HI> even after he had Quar|ters given. All which in the Law amount to &s;everal Acts of Piracy.</P>
<P>From whence it evidently appears, that the Articles in re&s;pect to Matters of Fact, are fully proved upon the Pri&s;oners; but whether &s;uch Facts amount to Piracy at Sea, or Robbery at Land, in Point of Law, remains a Que&s;tion; which naturally leads me to the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e Points in Law offered by the Pri&s;oner's Advocate in their Defence.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002818_0016_0FE650126CA444B8">And Fir&s;t, he argues, that the Ve&s;&s;el when &s;eized and taken by the Pri&s;o|ners and others, was at an Anchor in the Port of <HI>Malega&s;h,</HI> near the Land, and <HI>Infra Corpus Comitatus,</HI> and therefore is only Robbery at the Common Law.</P>
<P><Q>If a Pirate enters a Port or Haven, and A&s;&s;aults and Robs a Merchant-Ship at Anchor there, this is no Piracy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March. Com. <HI>p. 183.</HI></NOTE> becau&s;e it's not done <HI>Super Altum Mare,</HI> but a down right Robbery at the Common Law, and the Anonimous Author for this quotes <HI>Moor,</HI> 756.</Q></P>
<P>In An&s;wer, the Ca&s;e is not truly given us by that Author, as reported by Sir <HI>Francis Moor</HI>; neither is the Author in putting &s;aid Ca&s;e con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf; for his following Words are, <Q>And if the Crime be committed either <HI>Super Altum Mare,</HI> or in great Rivers within the Realm, which are looked up|on as Common High-Ways, then it is Piracy.</Q> Which plainly militates with what the Author immediately before a&s;&s;erted for Law. But to return to the Ca&s;e in <HI>Moor</HI>'s Reports; the fir&s;t Que&s;tion there put by the Lord Chancellour to all the Judges was, <HI>If the Clergy extended to Piracy, upon an Arraignment on the Stat.</HI> 28. H. 8. And Re&s;olved, It did not, unle&s;s the Piracy was done in a Creek or other River, in which the Common Law before the <HI>Stat.</HI> had Juri&s;diction; and not if it was done in <HI>Alto Mari,</HI> and out of the Body of the County. And the&s;e Words, <HI>In which the Common Law before the</HI> Stat. <HI>had Juri&s;diction,</HI> fully im|ply, &s;ince the <HI>Stat.</HI> the Common Law has not Juri&s;diction. And the Words of the <HI>Stat.</HI> are, <Q>All Trea&s;ons, Felonies, Robberies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Committed in or upon the Sea, or in any other Haven, River, Creek or Place where the Admiral hath, or pretends to have Power, Authority, or Juri&s;diction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Coke</HI> thereupon Comments thus; <Q>The&s;e Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 113. q.</NOTE> &s;ays he, (<HI>Or pretends to have,</HI> &amp;c.) are thus to be under&s;tood: Between the High-Water Mark and Low-Water Mark: For tho' the Land be <HI>Infra Corpus Commitatus</HI> at the Re-flow; yet when the Sea is full, the Admiral hath Juri&s;diction <HI>&s;uper aquam,</HI> as long as the Sea flows.</Q> Now the Place where the Seizing and piratically Taking the Ve&s;&s;el in the Articles, was in the Port of <HI>Malega&s;h,</HI> where the Sea is always full, and con&s;equently within the Admiral's Juri&s;diction. But the Books make a further di&s;tinction between Creeks, Ports and Ha|vens, actually challenged as part of the Bodies of Counties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 140, 141. x.</NOTE> and from whence a Jury may come. And Ports, Creeks and Havens, that are out of every County, from whence no Jury can come, the former appertains (as is &s;aid) to the Juri&s;diction of the Common Law Courts, the latter confe&s;&s;edly to the Admiralty. But if all Ports, Creeks and Harbours are generally and without this Di&s;tinction, out of the Admiralty's Juri&s;diction, then the&s;e Words of the <HI>Stat.</HI> 28. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <Q>Upon the Sea, or in any other Ha|ven, Creek, or other Place where the Admiral hath, or pretends to have Power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> would be Vain and Idle, as al&s;o the Words of the <HI>Stat.</HI> of the 12, 13. <HI>W.</HI> 3. Ch. 7 which &s;ay, <Q>All Piracies. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Committed upon the Sea, or in any Haven, Creek or Place where the Admiral hath Juri&s;diction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>All which clearly &s;hews, that there are &s;uch Havens, Rivers and Creeks where the Legi&s;lature &s;uppo&s;es the Admiral to have Juri&s;diction; and which
<PB N="18" REF="002818_0017_0FE65012A223B348">
mo&s;t indi&s;putably are &s;uch Havens, Rivers and Creeks, that (in my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Words) are out of every County, and from whence no Jury can come; which is the Circum&s;tance of the Port where this Ve&s;&s;el was piratically taken by the Pri&s;oners. But what &s;ilences all Arguments of this Nature, in re&s;pect to the Admiralty's Juri&s;diction in Ports, Creeks and Havens, touching Acts of Piracy, and removes all Pleas of this &s;ort, are the Words of the <HI>Stat.</HI> 8. K. G. Ch. 24. Sect. 1. <Q>And if any Per&s;on belonging to any Ship or Ve&s;&s;el what&s;oever, upon meeting any Merchant-Ship upon the High Seas, or in any Port, Haven or Creek what&s;oever, &s;hall forcibly Board and Enter into &s;uch Ship, and tho' they do not &s;eize and carry her off, &s;hall throw over-board or de&s;troy any part of the Goods or Merchandizes belonging to &s;uch Ship, the Per&s;ons guil|ty thereof, &s;hall be deemed and puni&s;hed as Pirates:</Q> And therefore I &s;hall re&s;t this part of the Pri&s;oner's Defence, and proceed to the Con&s;ideration of the other Point of Law offered by their Advocate, and Calculated for <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> Junior, namely, That he was at the time of the taking the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el, an In|fant under the Age of Fourteen, not <HI>&s;ui juris,</HI> and by Law no Act of Piracy or Felony can be imputed to him.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, The Gentleman is wrong in his Hypothe&s;is, as by <HI>Evidenti&acirc; Per&s;onae</HI>; neither did the Father or any other pretend to &s;ay the Pri&s;o|ner was under the Age of Fourteen. And for as much as &s;uch a Special De|fence is to exempt the Party from the Puni&s;hment of a General Statute, it's incumbent upon the Gentleman to make Legal Evidence of the Fact relied upon. But my Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> under <HI>Murther,</HI> &s;ays, <Q>An Infant within the Age of Di&s;cretion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hale</HI>'s Pleas of the Crown, <HI>p. 43.</HI></NOTE> kills a Man, no Felony; as if he be Nine or Ten Years old: But if by Circum&s;tances it appear|eth he could di&s;tingui&s;h between Good and Evil, it is Felony; as if he hide the Dead, make Excu&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> That the Pirates looked upon this <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> Junior as a Per&s;on capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing, is evident by committing the greate&s;t Tru&s;t and Charge unto him, namely, the Guard over the Arms; and that he could di&s;tingui&s;h between Good and Evil, is plain, when he cry'd for Quarters, and afterwards when he thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently armed with a Fi&s;herman's Pew, attempted the De&s;truction of <HI>Sprague,</HI> thereby as far as in him lay, preventing the regaining of the Ve&s;&s;el: By all which, and by many more incident Matters of Fact that turned out in the Evidence, it clearly appears he was a free Agent, and capable of making Legal Di&s;tinctions. And for as much as there is no Di&s;crimination in re&s;pect to the Crimes charged upon the Pri&s;oners, as Your Honour values the pre&s;er|vation of the Laws of the Land, the Lives and Properties of His Maje&s;ty's Subjects, and would &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid any fatal Con&s;equence that may attend an illegal Acquittal; I hope there will be as little di&s;tinction in re&s;pect to their Sentence, but that Your Honour will ju&s;tly pronounce them equally Guilty.</P></Q>
<P>The Advocate General having Concluded, the Court was cleared; and after mature and deliberate Con&s;ideration of what the King's Witne&s;&s;es

Depo&s;ed, the Pri&s;oners Defence made by them&s;elves and their Advocate, together with the Replication of the Advocate General, the Court voted Unanimou&s;ly, that the &s;aid <HI>John Bapti&s;t Jedre,</HI> alias <HI>Laverdure,</HI> and <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> Junior, are &s;everally Guilty of Piracy, Felony and Robbery, ac|cording to the Articles Exhibited again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Then they were brought to the Bar again, and the Pre&s;ident pronoun|ced the &s;aid <HI>John Bapti&s;t Jedre,</HI> alias <HI>Laverdure,</HI> and <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> junior &s;everally Guilty. &mdash; Whereupon the Advocate on Behalf of His Ma|je&s;ty moved, that Sentence might be given again&s;t them according to Law. Then they were &s;everally askt if they had any thing further to &s;ay why Sentence of Death &s;hould not be pronounced again&s;t them, and they Alledging nothing but what was offered before in their behalf on their Tryal, the Pre&s;ident pronounced Sentence again&s;t them &s;everally in the words following, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>You&mdash; are to go from hence to the place from whence you came, and thence to the place of Execution, there to be hanged up by the Neck until you are Dead, and the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</Q></P>

<P>After Reading the above Examinations, the Pri&s;oners were &s;everally Askt whether the &s;ame were true? And altho' their Advocate advi&s;ed them, that they were not obliged to own in Court, what they owned before the Ju&s;tices afore&s;aid; Yet they &s;everally acknowledged that their Examinations were true.</P>
<P>Then was Read the Ratification made the fourth day of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, at His Maje&s;ty's Fort of <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> of the Articles of Peace &s;tipulated by the Delegates at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the fifteenth day of <HI>December</HI> foregoing, (which Articles were al&s;o Read) in behalf of the <HI>Penob&s;cot, Narridgwalk,</HI> Saint <HI>John</HI>'s, Cape <HI>Sables,</HI> and other <HI>Indian</HI> Tribes belonging to, and Inhabiting within His Maje&s;ty's Territories of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> &amp;c. And by Major <HI>Paul Ma&s;carene,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioner for the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> in behalf of His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="002818_0029_0FE650324BA4D1D8">Afterwards the Pri&s;oners being ask'd whether they had &s;een any of the <HI>Indians</HI> that were at the Ratification of the Peace at <HI>Annapolis</HI>? They an&s;wered, they had been in Company with &s;everal of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who&s;e Names were &s;ub&s;cribed to the &s;aid Ratification; And particularly <HI>James Mews</HI> owned, that about twenty days before the &s;aid <HI>Doty</HI>'s Sloop was taken, he was in Company with <HI>Antoin,</HI> one of the Chiefs of the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Menis,</HI> and about eight or ten days afterwards, he &s;aw <HI>Indian Simon,</HI> who u&s;ed to carry Letters from <HI>Menis,</HI> &amp;c. to <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> and was pre&s;ent, as he under&s;tood, at the Negotiation of the Peace; and the &s;aid <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Philip Mews,</HI> both &s;ignified to the Court their belief that <HI>Antoin</HI> was at <HI>Annapolis</HI> treating of the Peace; and they al&s;o own|ed, that they lately &s;aw Captain <HI>Walker,</HI> alias <HI>Piere,</HI> one of the Chiefs of the <HI>Indians</HI> at or near <HI>Malega&s;h</HI> and <HI>Sabuckatook,</HI> who was at <HI>Annapo|lis</HI> at the Treaty; and that his Brother <HI>Catou&s;e</HI> was returned from thence, &s;ince the Ratification of the Peace.</P>
<P>Then the Pri&s;oners Advocate made his Pleas in their Defence, in the following manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>I Now a &s;econd Time appear before Your Honour, Mr. Pre&s;ident, and the re&s;t of the Honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners of this Court, in behalf of &s;ome Per&s;ons accu&s;ed of Piracy: Who tho' they be <HI>Indians,</HI> have and will experi|ence &s;o much Candour and Indulgence from this Court, as mu&s;t convince even the barbarous and Salvage Tribes to which they belong, of Your great Ju&s;tice and Impartiality. Your Honours, I doubt not, are &s;en&s;ible I am not &s;end of this Office: But my Duty to Your Honour, and the Honourable Court, and de&s;ire that nothing may be neglected, which in Ju&s;tice to the Pri|&s;oners ought to be declared, engage me in this Affair.</P>
<P>I humbly &s;ubmit it to Your Honours, Whether at the Time the Facts they are accu&s;ed of, are laid to be committed, they were not Enemies, or in a State of War with us: 'Tis true it appears, that the Ratification of the Peace between His Maje&s;ty's Government of <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> and the Cape <HI>Sable In|dians,</HI> was made at <HI>Annapolis</HI> on the fourth of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t; but that regards that Government only; and the Covenant on the part of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they not commit Ho&s;tilities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> extends to the Inhabitants of that Province only. The Ve&s;&s;el &s;eized at <HI>Malega&s;h,</HI> in which the Evidences for the King were, belongs to His Maje&s;ty's Subjects of this Province: And the Pri&s;oners declare, that at the Time of the taking Capt. <HI>Doty</HI> and his Ve&s;&s;el, they nei|ther knew or heard of the Ratification of the Peace between this Province and the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI>; but on the contrary, were informed even by <HI>Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="31" REF="002818_0030_0FE6503C95D9D388">
men,</HI> as well as <HI>French,</HI> among the latter of which, were (as they inform me) Mon&s;ieur St. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">e</HI> of <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> and his Son <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> and by two eminent Cape <HI>Sable</HI> Indians, <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">age</HI> and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">age,</HI> that there was no Peace made, but only talked of; and that but a Day or two before the Facts are charged in the Articles to be committed.</P>
<P>The Ratification indeed at <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI> was on the fifth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> but that does not argue that the Pri&s;oners were acquainted with it, they living in a far, re|mote and di&s;tant Place of another Government: And being but an incon&s;ide|rable Number of People, the Law will not, with Submi&s;&s;ion, pre&s;ume a Per|&s;on to be knowing of a thing, unle&s;s there appear &s;ome Circum&s;tances by which it may be rea&s;onably concluded, he cannot but know it. If therefore the Pri&s;oners were in a State of War with us, what they have done, they may well ju&s;tify, by the Laws of GOD, Nature, Nations and Arms: And their declaring to <HI>Doty</HI> and his Men, that it was Peace, may be rea&s;onably accounted a Stratagem of War, to draw and en&s;nare them in their Churches; which fort of Stratagems are very frequently made u&s;e of in War.</P>
<P>Your Honours may well remember what I urged ye&s;terday in favour of the two <HI>French-men,</HI> which therefore I &s;hall not &s;pend Your Time in in&s;i&s;ting on, &s;ince the Sentence You have pa&s;&s;ed upon them, manife&s;ts it to be over-ruled; I mean, that the Fact charged being committed within the Body of a County, amounts only to a Notorious Robbery, which is triable at the Common-Law by a Jury, and not to Piracy: And herewith agrees the Definition of Piracy, given by Mr. Advocate General. I &s;hall only beg leave to add to what I then &s;aid, That as the Fact was certainly begun when the Ve&s;&s;el was at Anchor in the Harbour; &s;o it being but one continued Act, ought to be tried where it was begun, <HI>i. e.</HI> within the Body of the County.</P>
<P>The Carriage of the Pri&s;oners to the Men, was very Unju&s;tifiable in their beating of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this I attribute partly to their barbarous Natures and Cu&s;toms, and partly to their Drink. <HI>John Mi&s;&s;el</HI> &s;eems to have had the lea&s;t &s;hare in the Affair, he not coming on board till after the Colours were &s;truck: But I &s;hall leave their Ca&s;es to Your Honour's wi&s;e Con&s;ideration, and doubt not of a Judgment equal to the Merit and Ju&s;tice thereof.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Pri&s;oners being ask'd, if they had any thing to &s;ay for them&s;elves, more than their Advocate had ob&s;erved on their behalf?&mdash; <HI>James Mews</HI> &s;aid, he was in Liquor; and they all excu&s;ed them&s;elves by alledging, that it was the fir&s;t Offence of that Nature they had been Guilty of, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards the King's Advocate Reply'd upon the Pri&s;oners Advo|cate, as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="32" REF="002818_0031_0FE6503CBB97DFE8">
<P>May it plea&s;e Your Honour, Mr. <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> and the Honourable Com|mi&s;&s;ioners,</P>
<P>I Shall not now Tre&s;pa&s;s upon Your Patience, in reiterating the &s;everal Matters of Fact proved upon the Pri&s;oners: And more e&s;pe|cially when I con&s;ider they turn out as &s;trong, if not &s;tronger again&s;t them, than again&s;t tho&s;e two that ju&s;tly received their Sentence Ye&s;ter|day.&mdash; And of this their Advocate is perfectly convinced, and there|fore indu&s;triou&s;ly waves any Advantage that otherwi&s;e may be taken to the weakne&s;s of the Evidence; and re&s;ts their Defence on an Allega|tion, That at the Time of Committing the&s;e Facts, they were in a State of Enmity with us, ignorant of the Ratification of the Peace, and therefore not guilty of Piracy, by the Law of Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To which I An&s;wer:&mdash; That the Gentleman is the &s;econd Time mi&s;taken in Fact. For on the Fifteenth Day of <HI>December,</HI> 1725. the &s;everal Tribes of the Ea&s;tern <HI>Indians,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI>'s and Cape <HI>Sables,</HI> &amp;c. by their Delegates, did enter into Articles of Pacification at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> with the Governments of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> whereby among other things, they promi&s;ed in behalf of their re&s;pective Tribes, <Q>That they will cea&s;e all Acts of Ho&s;tility, Injuries and Di&s;cords, towards all the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and not offer the lea&s;t Hurt, Violence or Mole&s;tation to them, or any of them, in their Per&s;ons or E&s;tates; but will henceforward Hold and Maintain a firm, con&s;tant Amity and Friend&s;hip with all the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> and will never Confederate or Combine with any other Nation to their Prejudice.</Q> And further, there are al&s;o in&s;erted in the &s;aid Articles of Pacification the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>We (meaning the &s;aid Delegates, in behalf of them&s;elves and their re&s;pective Tribes) Sub|mitting our &s;elves to be Ruled and Governed by His Maje&s;ty's Laws, and de&s;iring to have the Benefit of the &s;ame.</Q> And on the fourth Day of <HI>June</HI> following, at <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> the Chiefs and Repre&s;entatives of the &s;aid <HI>Indians,</HI> in Compliance with the &s;aid Articles, &s;tipulated as afore&s;aid, by their Delegates, and in Obedience thereunto, Solemnly Confirmed and Ratified the &s;ame. By all which it mo&s;t evidently ap|pears, that the <HI>Indians</HI> were not, as pretended, at the Time of execu|ting the &s;everal Acts of Piracy charged upon them, in a State of War with the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> but in firm Amity with His Sacred Maje&s;ty, and to be Governed by His Maje&s;ty's Laws, and Entituled to the Benefit of them.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002818_0032_0FE6503F08CDC0F0"><Q>And if any Foreigner, Subject to any Prince or State in Amity with the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> commit Piracies on the Ships or Goods of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the &s;ame is Piracy, within the Stat. 28. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>Sea-Laws,</HI> p. 478. <HI>q.</HI></Q> Having thus unan&s;werably acquitted this Pro&s;ecution from the Exception, I beg leave to give a &s;hot An&s;wer to what further was offered by the Advocate for the Pri&s;oners, under this Head, namely, that they were ignorant of the&s;e Negotiations, and therefore the Crime of Piracy ought not to be imputed to them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to Your Honours, It's a &s;ettled Maxim in re&s;pect to the Breaches of Penal-Laws, <HI>Ignorantia non excu&s;at Legem.</HI> And was the Fact truly &s;o, who is chargeable with the Omi&s;&s;ion? The Chiefs and Delegates in Duty ought to apprize (as doubtle&s;s they did) their re|&s;pective Tribes, of the &s;aid Articles of Pacification and Confirma|tion, and not the Government that &s;tipulated with them. But from their own Words, and Words &s;poke in their hearing, as appeared in the Evidence, and al&s;o from the Circum&s;tances in the Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be collected they were fully &s;en&s;ible of all the&s;e Solemn Treaties and Proceedings; for a&s;hoar one of them &s;aluted the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> did aboard, by &s;aying, <HI>It's Peace; the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>are now all one as Bro|thers</HI>: And by their own Acknowledgement, they had &s;een and con|ver&s;ed with &s;ome of their Chiefs, that had at <HI>Annapolis</HI> Confirmed the &s;aid Articles of Pacification &s;ince &s;uch Confirmation, and once in par|ticular, but a very incon&s;iderable Time before their perpetrating this their wicked Act; &s;o that there is neither Colour or Shadow to &s;up|po&s;e them Ignorant; or according to Law would &s;uch Ignorance ex|empt them from the Puni&s;hment ju&s;tly due to their Demerits.</P>
<P>Therefore I doubt not but Your Honours will in like manner declare them Guilty, as You lately have the other Accomplices in the&s;e their wicked Actions.</P></Q>
<P>The Advocate General having Concluded, the Court was cleared; Then the Commi&s;&s;ioners fully and deliberately weighed and con&s;idered the Evidences again&s;t the Pri&s;oners, and al&s;o the Defence made by them and their Advocate, together with Mr. Advocate General's Replication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And Voted Unanimou&s;ly, That the &s;aid <HI>James Mews, Philip Mews,</HI> and <HI>John Mi&s;&s;el,</HI> were &s;everally Guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002818_0033_0FE6503F37E0F650">Then the Pri&s;oners were brought to the Bar again, when the Pre&s;ident Pronounced them &s;everally Guilty of Piracy, Felony and Robbery, ac|cording to the Articles Exhibited again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Advocate General on His Maje&s;ty's behalf, demanded Sentence again&s;t them.</P>
<P>And the Pri&s;oners when ask'd what they had further to &s;ay, why Sen|tence of Death &s;hould not be Pronounced again&s;t them, alledging, they had nothing to &s;ay more than had been offered upon their Trial; The Pre&s;ident of the Court accordingly Pronounced Sentence again&s;t them &s;everally, in the Words following, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>You &mdash; are to go from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of Execution, and there to be hanged up by the Neck, until you are Dead; and the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</Q></P>
