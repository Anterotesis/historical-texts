<P>THE work of man's redemption, through the merit of the Son of God, is a mo&s;t important theme! It is the prin|cipal de&s;ign and &s;ubject of divine revelation&mdash;compre|hends in it all divine and &s;aving knowledge&mdash;It is a &s;ubject which the angels de&s;ire to look into, nor is one de&s;ire gratified, 'till new ones ari&s;e;&mdash;for here is &s;cope for alternate inquiry, and plea&s;ing admiration, 'till time &s;hall be no more, and to all eternity&mdash;And this truth known and embraced by men, will make them wi&s;e to &s;alvation.&mdash;It is a &s;ong that is, and ever will be new&mdash;a &s;ong melodious in the ears of God him&s;elf&mdash;entertaining to &s;aints and angels on earth and in heaven, and will be their delightful em|ployment to all eternity. And a clear knowledge and under&s;tand|ing of the truths contained in it, will be the means, in the hand of the &s;pirit, of di&s;pelling all the clouds of ignorance and mi&s;ts of error, that have &s;o long overvailed the nations, and diffu&s;ing thro' them all, knowledge and grace, purity and joy&mdash;the means of con|verting thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands from &s;in to holine&s;s; deliver|ing them from the power of darkne&s;s, and tran&s;lating them into the kingdom of God's dear Son&mdash;the means of bringing on the lat|ter day glory; breaking the &s;erpent's head; expo&s;ing his infernal

<P N="1">I. I am to &s;how what is implied in our redemption to God.</P>
<P>And in general, it implies that we are in a &s;tate of bondage&mdash;out of which the Son of God hath redeemed us, by paying the <HI>price</HI> of our ran&s;om, and by conquering and &s;ubduing that <HI>power</HI> by which we were held.</P>
<P>Man, in his fir&s;t creation, was made in the image of God. His &s;oul con&s;i&s;ted of three faculties, <HI>under&s;tanding, principle</HI> and <HI>will.</HI> &mdash;His <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> is the &s;eat of ideas and &s;peculative knowledge; his <HI>principle</HI> is the &s;eat of &s;en&s;ation, perception and moral ta&s;te&mdash; his will is the &s;eat of exerci&s;es and volitions.</P>
<P>The <HI>principle</HI> of the &s;oul, as it is a di&s;tinct faculty, is &s;ometimes called <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of heart, <HI>temper, affection, in&s;tinct,</HI> &amp;c. In &s;crip|ture it is called <HI>mind, nature, trea&s;ure, fountain,</HI> &amp;c. And it is evident that <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> or <HI>will</HI> cannot &s;upply the place of <HI>princi|ple,</HI> by being the &s;eat of &s;en&s;ation, perception or moral ta&s;te.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pr. Edwards Orig. Sin, p. 157.</NOTE>&mdash;</P>
<P>And the &s;oul created with the&s;e faculties, dependent on the will of God for its exi&s;tence and activity, is capable of forming ideas, perceptions and volitions it&s;elf. Though God creates and upholds the&s;e faculties; yet God doth not <HI>create</HI> the <HI>ideas, perceptions</HI> and <HI>volitions,</HI> with their <HI>rectitude</HI> or <HI>&s;infulne&s;s,</HI> which are only con|tingent modes of the exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>The ideas, perceptions and volitions of the mind, are tran&s;ient; but the three faculties of the &s;oul are permanent; and will remain the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance to all eternity, though they may alter as to their moral quality and perfection.</P>
<P>And in the&s;e faculties of &s;oul con&s;i&s;ted the <HI>natural</HI> image of God, in which man was created. And the <HI>moral</HI> image of God, in which man was created, con&s;i&s;ted in the <HI>rectitude</HI> of his <HI>principle</HI>; which laid a foundation for right perception, or moral ta&s;te, of tho&s;e ob|jects that were formed in his under&s;tanding. The under&s;tanding is not the &s;eat of moral rectitude or ta&s;te; but the heart, including the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">See Pr. Edwards on Orig. Sin, part 2d, chap. 1&s;t, &s;ec. 1.</NOTE>

<HI>principle</HI> and <HI>will</HI> is the &s;eat of all holine&s;s and &s;in. And as the principle, in the fir&s;t creation of angels and men, was right and uncorrupted, all the perceptions and exerci&s;es of their <HI>principle</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> were holy: God made man upright; in his own image, in knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s.</P>
<P>And regeneration is a rectifying this principle, and removing its corruption, by the &s;upernatural influences of the holy &s;pirit of God, which is again mini&s;tred to mankind, through the <HI>knowledge</HI> of Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel. See 2. Pet. i. 3.4. Man being provided with the means of knowledge, was capable of forming the truth of God's character, law and government in his under&s;tanding; and of perceiving and reli&s;hing the moral beauty and excellency of them, in his <HI>principle,</HI> and his <HI>will</HI> was di&s;po&s;ed and inclined to love God's character, obey his law, and &s;ubmit to his government, and all his &s;ubordinate affections and pa&s;&s;ions to a proper exerci&s;e. Man, then, placed his happine&s;s in the knowledge of God, love to him and joy in him. And now, when God had brought moral creatures into exi&s;tence, it was nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be a moral govern|ment; and therefore God gave them a law, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a mo|ral government over his intelligent creatures&mdash;to this law he an|nexed a penalty, in order to &s;upport the authority of it, and the dignity and vigour of his government. And it was nece&s;&s;ary that the threatening of this law be inflicted on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; other|wi&s;e God him&s;elf could not uphold moral government over his in|telligent creatures. To &s;uppo&s;e that God governs rational crea|tures without a law, enforced by promi&s;es and threatenings, re|wards and puni&s;hments, but by irre&s;i&s;tible force, or divine effici|ency, is to confound the di&s;tinction between <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> go|vernment&mdash;For God to create or produce &s;in and righteou&s;ne&s;s, obedience and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, by omnipotent power, as he doth a world or light, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the very idea of <HI>moral</HI> govern|ment&mdash;of blame or prai&s;e&mdash;or any accountablene&s;s for our exerci&s;es or actions. Sin is not a created exi&s;tence produced by God, but only a contingent mode of exerci&s;e, originated by a rational crea|ture in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and always pre-&s;uppo&s;es error in the under|&s;tanding of &s;uch a creature, which is incompatible with a being perfect in knowledge. And the great God, in order to manife&s;t and &s;upport the honour of his own character, as moral Governor, and the authority and dignity of his law and government, and com|mand obedience, and &s;o promote the peace, pro&s;perity and happi|ne&s;s of his moral kingdom; declared him&s;elf to be infinite, eternal and immutable in his exi&s;tence, knowledge, wi&s;dom and power. And in his moral perfections, &s;uch as benevolence, ju&s;tice and truth, or in one word, his righteou&s;ne&s;s or holine&s;s. And, con&s;equently, that his laws mu&s;t be holy, ju&s;t and good, and his government

righteous. So that all the &s;ubjects of his moral kingdom may put an <HI>implicit</HI> faith in his word, and yield an <HI>implicit</HI> obedience to his laws and commands, and an <HI>implicit</HI> &s;ubjection to his government.</P>
<P>And God's moral kingdom was now in peace; and all the &s;ub|jects of it high in the divine favour; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of liberty and life; and probationers for immortality, in a &s;tate of holine&s;s and happi|ne&s;s in the favour of God forever. They were di&s;po&s;ed to love God's moral character, and yield an <HI>implicit</HI> obedience to his com|mands, and rejoice in his government and works&mdash; And when the foundations of the world were laid, all the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy! And the <HI>law</HI> of God, as a tran&s;cript of his moral perfections, expre&s;&s;ed his will, and was calculated to manife&s;t the RIGHTEOUS|NESS of God as moral Governor; i. e. his benevolence, his ju&s;tice and truth; and &s;o to lead them into a more perfect knowledge of God; and con&s;equently to increa&s;e their conformity to him, in holine&s;s and happine&s;s. And they had the indwelling of the holy &s;pirit, in its vital influences, to accompany the truth of God's character, and increa&s;e their love to it.</P>
<P>The righteou&s;ne&s;s of God exhibited in his law (as we ju&s;t ob&s;er|ved) con&s;i&s;ts in three things, viz. Benevolence, Ju&s;tice and Truth &mdash;By benevolence, I mean the goodne&s;s, love, mercy and grace of God&mdash;by ju&s;tice, I mean his di&s;tributing to every one rewards and puni&s;hments according to their de&s;erts&mdash;of treating every one ac|cording to his moral character&mdash;And by truth, I mean the divine veracity and faithfulne&s;s to his threatenings and promi&s;es; or his punctually fulfilling his word. The moral law is a tran&s;cript of the&s;e perfections of God&mdash;and the moral perfection of any intelli|gent creature is a conformity of heart and life, to the&s;e perfections of the Deity. This was the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the holy angels, and of innocent man in paradi&s;e. This righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, as mo|ral Governor, the moral law was de&s;igned to manife&s;t. The law, in its precepts, promi&s;es and threatenings, expre&s;&s;ed God's infinite regard to his own glory, and his benevolence to his moral kingdom, and his di&s;po&s;ition and determination to promote the peace, pro&s;|perity and happine&s;s of it; by communicating to them, the know|ledge of him&s;elf in his true character; and their duty to him, them|&s;elves and each other. The precept of the law is <HI>holy</HI>; &s;uited to conform the &s;inle&s;s ob&s;erver to the moral image of God, and &s;o pro|mote his happine&s;s. The rewards promi&s;ed in the law are <HI>good,</HI> infinitely exceeding the merit of the mo&s;t perfect ob&s;erver&mdash;And the penalty <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and &s;hows the infinite di&s;plea&s;ure of God again&s;t &s;in; and is no more than adequate to the crime; and is well &s;uit|ed to deter from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o maintain the peace and hap|pine&s;s of the obedient. And this law, as it manife&s;ts God's righte|ou&s;ne&s;s as moral Governor, hath a <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> tendency to promote the happine&s;s of its ob&s;ervers.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="020704_0006_0FB0A62B604565F8">And unle&s;s the Governor of the Univer&s;e, makes it appear by his punctually conferring the promi&s;ed rewards, and executing the threatened puni&s;hments of his law, that he is <HI>infinite</HI> in his bene|volence, <HI>inflexible</HI> in his ju&s;tice, and <HI>inviolable</HI> in his truth; his government cannot be &s;upported, but will be unhinged in the minds of his &s;ubjects, and will fall into contempt, and tend to di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>And God, in his fir&s;t creation of intelligent creatures, placed them in a &s;ituation near to him&s;elf, and &s;urrounded them with the happy fruits and te&s;timonies of his love, and under this holy, ju&s;t, and good law, every way &s;uited to advance his honour and glory, and their happine&s;s and well being. And all this happine&s;s was &s;u&s;pended upon condition of their yielding an <HI>implicit</HI> obedience to a known, po&s;itive command of God; given them for their trial; di&s;obedience to which command, was threatened with death: which death implied a withdrawment of the divine favour, and the in|dwelling of the holy &s;pirit, in its vital influences, and &s;o, in the <HI>total</HI> corruption of the moral principle&mdash;and in the lo&s;s of liberty, life and immortal happine&s;s, in the divine favour&mdash;and in a con|firmed &s;tate of <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> and mi&s;ery, under the wrath and cur&s;e of God for ever.</P>
<P>A number of the angels (perhaps not &s;eeing the <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of &s;ome plain, po&s;itive command given to them for their trial) tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed, and revolted from God, and fell under the penalty or cur&s;e &mdash;and had it immediately executed upon them, without any mercy or reprieve. Upon this revolt, a grand <HI>moral conte&s;t</HI> commenced between heaven and hell, concerning the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral Governor: and the devil &s;et him&s;elf to oppo&s;e God's moral government, not by natural force, but by temptation, by begui|ling, deceiving, and &s;o prevailing on the &s;ubjects of Gods moral kingdom, to believe and embrace that <HI>error,</HI> "God will not exe|cute the threatened penalty, if you do tran&s;gre&s;s his command." This implied that God is not <HI>inflexibly</HI> ju&s;t, and <HI>inviolably</HI> true; and that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with his infinite benevolence to inflict the puni&s;hment according to the threatening. And in con&s;equence of this, infinite di&s;honour is ca&s;t on God's character, and infinite da|mage done to his moral kingdom.</P>
<P>The devil having ri&s;en in rebellion again&s;t God by di&s;obeying his will, &s;eeks to &s;et up a kingdom founded in error and wicked|ne&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to God's moral kingdom, founded in truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. The devil (as I have before ob&s;erved) doth not contend with the Almighty for the <HI>natural</HI> kingdom or dominion of the univer&s;e&mdash;or &s;eek to re&s;i&s;t the natural power or omnipotence of God by <HI>force.</HI> But he contends with God for the <HI>moral</HI> kingdom &mdash;and oppo&s;es God, by oppo&s;ing his truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;The devil oppo&s;es God, by leading his &s;ubjects into erroneous notions concerning God's moral character, law and government, and in|ducing
<PB N="8" REF="020704_0007_0FB0A62CED023B68">
them to believe, that it is for their intere&s;t to embrace them and practice upon them; and to di&s;believe the threatening of God; or believe that God will not execute the threatening, if they tran&s;|gre&s;s his commands. And the nature of virtue and vice, and the very e&s;&s;ence of moral government, forbid that moral agents &s;hould be overruled, compelled or influenced by natural force or divine ef|ficiency; but require that they be influenced by the manife&s;tation of truth to their minds, and by propo&s;ing to them rewards and pu|ni&s;hments, in promi&s;es and threatenings.</P>
<P>Man being put in a &s;tate of trial, under a plain, po&s;itive com|mand of God; &s;atan, under the form of a &s;erpent, or rather a <HI>&s;e|raph</HI> (as it is in the original) deceived, beguiled, and &s;o prevail|ed upon our fir&s;t parents to believe that God would not execute the threatening on them if they did tran&s;gre&s;s&mdash;and upon this tempta|tion, they were emboldened to partake of that fruit which was plea|&s;ant to the eyes, good for food, and de&s;ired to make them wi&s;e; tho' they <HI>knew</HI> it was prohibited by an expre&s;s command of their all-wi&s;e and benevolent Creator. And the evil of this &s;in con&s;i&s;ted, in its being rebellion to the <HI>known</HI> command of their rightful Lord and Sovereign; to who&s;e known and expre&s;s commands, they were under infinite obligation to yield an <HI>implicit</HI> obedience, though to them, no <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for the command appeared, but the contrary. With &s;uch a command Abraham was tried, and yielded an implicit obe|dience to it, though to him no other <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for obedience appeared, but only it was a command of God; in every other view it mu&s;t have appeared <HI>unrea&s;onable.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;in was not enmity to God's moral character; for that implies a previous withdrawment of the holy &s;pirit of God from the &s;oul, in its vital influences; and a corruption of the moral princi|ple, which mu&s;t have been a <HI>judicial</HI> act of God, or <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> for &s;in, which could not con&s;i&s;tently precede tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay, How could there be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion without pre|vious enmity, &s;ince all &s;in now proceeds from corruption of princi|ple, and want of love to God? To this I an&s;wer, it is evident there may be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion which doth not proceed from want of love to God's moral character, but from <HI>deception.</HI> We have an in&s;tance of it 1 Kings xiii. in the prophet of the Lord that was &s;ent to Beth|el, to denounce judgements again&s;t that place, and was expre&s;sly commanded by God, "To eat no bread, nor drink water, in that place:" and the prophet appeared well di&s;po&s;ed to obey the com|mand of God; till an other prophet pur&s;ued him, and overtook him in his return; and &s;aid to him, "I am a prophet al&s;o as thou art; and an angel &s;pake unto me, by the word of the Lord, &s;aying, bring him back with thee into thine hou&s;e, that he may eat bread, and drink water. <HI>But he lied unto him."</HI> "So he went back with
<PB N="9" REF="020704_0008_0FB0A62E70B84658">
him and did eat bread in his hou&s;e, and drink water." And will any one &s;uppo&s;e that the di&s;obedience of the prophet, that came from Judah, proceeded from want of love to God? Did it not evidently proceed from his being <HI>deceived</HI> and <HI>beguiled</HI> by the prophet, that <HI>lied to him,</HI> in the name of the Lord? And yet was not his di&s;obe|dience a horrid &s;in in the &s;ight of God, which co&s;t him his life? Had that prophet been in the exerci&s;e of &s;upreme love to God, with|out any enmity to his moral character, would this have been any &s;ecurity again&s;t his being deceived, or his di&s;obedience? Did he not act as much under the influences of love to God, in the la&s;t act, as in the fir&s;t?</P>
<P>And may we not as rationally &s;uppo&s;e, that Eve was influenced by the devil to di&s;obedience in the &s;ame manner? The devil came to her, in the form of a <HI>&s;eraph</HI>; which form, holy angels often a&s;|&s;ume when they bring me&s;&s;ages to this world from God; and it is very probable, that the devil before his fall, as an angel of light, had appeared to our fir&s;t parents in the &s;ame form, as their guar|dian angel, with me&s;&s;ages from God; and now he transforms him|&s;elf again into an angel of light. To which in&s;tance, the Apo&s;tle may have reference, 2. Cor. xi. 14. "For &s;atan him&s;elf is tran&s;|formed into an angel of light." And the devil tells them as an ex|pre&s;s a <HI>lie,</HI> in the name of God, as the old prophet told the other &mdash;and by this <HI>lie</HI> the woman was <HI>deceived,</HI> and &s;o was in the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. And love to God's moral character could not have &s;ecu|red her again&s;t the deception. But yet this was an horrid &s;in in our fir&s;t parents, and &s;ubver&s;ive of all moral government. For it is impo&s;&s;ible that moral government, over creatures, that are imper|fect in their knowledge and wi&s;dom, &s;hould be &s;upported, unle&s;s they will put an <HI>implicit</HI> confidence in the wi&s;dom, an <HI>implicit</HI> faith in the word, and yield an <HI>implicit</HI> obedience to the command of their &s;overeign, who&s;e wi&s;dom and benevolence they have no rea|&s;on to doubt. What confu&s;ion would it make in an army, if the under officers and &s;oldiers refu&s;e obedience to the commands of their General, but in&s;i&s;t upon &s;eeing the rea&s;onablene&s;s of every com|mand before they execute it? Love to the moral character of the Sovereign, and &s;incere benevolence to the intere&s;t of his moral king|dom, would neither &s;ecure their obedience, or excu&s;e their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. God might have prevented their deception, and &s;ecured their obedience, by immediate <HI>revelation</HI> of the truth of his will, and their danger; but I do not &s;ee how this could have been done, by increa&s;ing their <HI>love</HI> to his moral character, by internal influ|ences. And in con&s;equence of this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of our fir&s;t pa|rents, and not before, the favour of God, and the vital influences of his holy &s;pirit, were withdrawn from the &s;oul; in con&s;equence of which their moral <HI>principle</HI> became <HI>totally</HI> corrupted and depraved

&mdash;they lo&s;t all love to God, and were filled with enmity to truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s&mdash;and love to darkne&s;s, error and wicked|ne&s;s&mdash;lo&s;t their liberty, life and immortal happine&s;s&mdash;became pri|&s;oners of divine ju&s;tice&mdash;involved in death &s;piritual, and expo&s;ed to death temporal, became dead in law, and were con&s;igned over by God, to a confirmed &s;tate of darkne&s;s, error and wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery; under the wrath of God, the power of &s;in, the tyranny of the devil, with &s;inning angels in hell; according to the threaten|ed penalty or cur&s;e, "In the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;ure|ly die." To be thus left of God, under the power of &s;piritual death, and given up to their own hearts lu&s;ts, to walk in their own coun&s;els, and chu&s;e their own delu&s;ion, and de&s;truction, is not only the &s;in of men, but their <HI>puni&s;hment.</HI> as you may &s;ee, P&s;al. lxxxi. 11.12.

<P>Now, our redemption by the Son of God con&s;i&s;ts, in his deliver|ing us from the penalty or puni&s;hment, threatened in the divine law, to &s;in&mdash;from the wrath and cur&s;e of God, and the dreadful pri&s;on of hell; from the power of &s;piritual death, ignorance, error and wickedne&s;s; from the delu&s;ion and tyranny of the devil, and all that everla&s;ting &s;hame and mi&s;ery, to which we are liable, whil|in the devil's kingdom&mdash;and re&s;toring us to the moral image and favour of God&mdash;and to liberty, life, and eternal glory and fe|licity in the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In redeeming us to God, he redeems us to all the &s;acred trinity; and rein&s;tates us in the favour of all.</P>
<P N="2">II. We proceed to con&s;ider, how the Son of God hath accom|pli&s;hed this work of redemption.</P>
<P>And in order to have a comprehen&s;ive view of this matter, we mu&s;t take into our con&s;ideration, that eternal <HI>&s;tipulation</HI> or <HI>compact</HI> which was made between the Father and the Son, called the <HI>cove|nant</HI> of <HI>redemption</HI> or of peace, and the law of mediation, of which law or covenant the P&s;almi&s;t &s;peaks, p&s;al. xl. 7.8. "Then &s;aid I, lo I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me: I de|light to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart." And Zach. vi. 13. "And the covenant of peace &s;hall be between them both." This covenant contained in it certain conditions to be performed by the Son as God's &s;ervant, and certain honours to be conferred upon him as the reward of his merit, by the Father. And the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, by which he paid the price of our redemption, made &s;atisfaction for &s;in, and merited all the honours conferred on him&s;elf, and all the benefits be&s;towed on his &s;piritual &s;eed, con&s;i&s;ts in what he did and &s;uffered in obedience to this law or
<PB N="11" REF="020704_0010_0FB0A631691B6C18">
covenant; for in fulfilling this law, con&s;i&s;ted his chief work and bu&s;ine&s;s in this world. And as a di&s;tinct divine agent, pre|vious to his being under any obligation to obey, God the Son took upon him the office of Mediator and Redeemer, before he a&s;&s;umed human nature&mdash;and executed &s;everal parts of the mediatorial office without human nature. He drew nigh to God the Father, and treated with him about terms of peace and reconciliation for men &mdash;entered into a covenant of redemption with the Father&mdash;and the human nature had no voice in this &s;tipulation&mdash;before he a&s;&s;u|med human nature he became a &s;urety for men, and received pro|mi&s;es and ble&s;&s;ings for them upon the credit of that fountain of me|rit which he engaged to procure by his &s;ervices and &s;ufferings in time&mdash;and he agreed, in the covenant, to do and &s;uffer all that the Father required of him, in order to procure &s;uch a fountain of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s or merit. And to make &s;uch terms, agreements and pro|mi&s;es, no more required a human nature in the Son, than in the Father. But when it was proper for him to perform the&s;e &s;ervices and endure the&s;e &s;ufferings, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to a&s;&s;ume hu|man nature (and cloath it with the moral character of his divine, that he might put his divine character in the power of his enemies) and not before. And as a divine agent he obeyed the law of me|diation in the execution of the offices of prophet, prie&s;t and king. And he fulfilled all that was required of him, as to obedience and &s;ufferings, in the covenant of redemption. The Son engaged to declare the righteou&s;ne&s;s and glory of God as moral Governor&mdash; &s;upport the dignity and authority of the divine law and government and &s;ecure, maintain and promote the good of his moral kingdom, more fully than they could have been, by the puni&s;hment of the &s;in|ner, recording to the threatening&mdash;and manife&s;t the evil of &s;in, and the di&s;plea&s;ure of God again&s;t it, and his di&s;po&s;ition and determina|tion to puni&s;h the &s;inner, unle&s;s &s;atisfaction be made adequate to the crime; and di&s;play his ju&s;tice in puni&s;hing the &s;inner, in &s;uch a manner that the &s;inner may be convinced that it is an evil and bitter thing to violate the law of God&mdash;and the violation de&s;erves, and may be expected to be followed with the mo&s;t awful con&s;equen|ces. The Son engages to make it fully appear, by what he &s;hall do and &s;uffer, that God is infinite in his benevolence, inflexible in his ju&s;tice, and that his truth is inviolable; that his law is holy, ju&s;t and good, and his government righteous, and that he is the &s;ame in execution as in legi&s;lation. And the&s;e things being done, atonement and &s;atisfaction are made; and God can, con&s;i&s;tent with his ju&s;tice, be propitious to him that receives this atonement, by believing in Je&s;us&mdash;and can pardon, ju&s;tify and confer eternal life upon the &s;inner. For on this covenant of redemption God hath founded a covenant of grace, in which he hath promi&s;ed the&s;e be|nefits
<PB N="12" REF="020704_0011_0FB0A63353B82FF0">
to all that &s;hall believe in his Son. And the Son of God en|gaged in the covenant of redemption, not only to make &s;atisfaction to divine ju&s;tice for &s;in, and a purcha&s;e for believers; but he al&s;o engaged to deliver his people from the power of darkne&s;s, and tran&s;late them into his own kingdom, and gain their hearts to him|&s;elf, and &s;et up his kingdom in their hearts, and de&s;troy God's enemies. Now, to an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es, the Son of God came into this world to engage in a war with God's enemies&mdash;and to de|cide the moral conte&s;t concerning God's righteou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;o take the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hearts of &s;inners for him&s;elf, by delivering them from the error, delu&s;ion and wickedne&s;s of the devil's kingdom&mdash; and cau&s;ing them to embrace truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o build up a kingdom for him&s;elf, upon the ruins of the devil's kingdom. And the grand controver&s;y is, Whether it is con&s;i&s;tent with the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral Governor of the univer&s;e, i. e. with his ju&s;tice, benevolence, love and goodne&s;s to his moral kingdom, to inflict eternal death upon any of his creatures for di&s;obedience or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. God declares, that his righteou&s;ne&s;s or glory, as moral Governor, obliges him to do this&mdash;He hath threatened it in his law, and to remit the penalty in one in&s;tance, unle&s;s adequate &s;atisfaction be made, &s;o as to &s;ecure the rights of government; is to give up the honour of his truth and ju&s;tice, and his benevolence to his moral kingdom. And God will not pardon &s;inners, unle&s;s he can do it in a way con&s;i&s;tent with his own glory and the good of his moral kingdom&mdash;a way, in which the dignity and authority, of the law and Legi&s;lator, and the exi&s;tence and righteou&s;ne&s;s of mo|ral government may be pre&s;erved. That which rendered the pu|ni&s;hment of the &s;inner nece&s;&s;ary was, that the infinite evil of &s;in, and righteous di&s;plea&s;ure of God again&s;t it, might be expre&s;&s;ed&mdash; and the dignity and authority of the law might be maintained&mdash;the vigour of divine government be &s;upported, and the happine&s;s of God's moral kingdom by this mean advanced.</P>
<P>The devil &s;aith, God is not righteous; he cannot maintain his truth <HI>inviolable,</HI> his ju&s;tice <HI>inflexible,</HI> and yet manife&s;t his infinite benevolence&mdash;and he will not execute the threatening. And &s;in|ners are in the devil's kingdom and intere&s;t, they e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, and are continually contending with the Almighty, and replying again&s;t God. They cannot &s;ee how it is con&s;i&s;tent with his benevo|lence to verify the truth of his threatening on &s;inners. Hence they deny the eternity of hell torments, and plead for univer&s;al &s;alva|tion, and an other &s;tate of probation after this life is ended. And pre&s;uming upon the goodne&s;s and benevolence of God, they tran&s;|gre&s;s his commands with the hope of impunity. You cannot make an infidel or impenitent &s;inner believe, by the preaching of the law, that God will verify the threatening on &s;inners. To convince &s;in|ners
<PB N="13" REF="020704_0012_0FB0A6370C3AC490">
of this is what the law cannot do, becau&s;e it is become weak through the fle&s;h; but God &s;ending his own Son, in the likene&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h, his being made a &s;acrifice for &s;in hath condemned &s;in in the fle&s;h, that the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law might be fulfilled in all that believe in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and walk not after the fle&s;h but af|ter the &s;pirit; by faith in this &s;acrifice, the &s;inner is fully convinced of &s;in, righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgement, and is intere&s;ted in a righte|ou&s;ne&s;s which fully an&s;wers the demands of the law; and &s;o the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law is fulfilled in them. See Rom. viii. 3.4.</P>
<P>But here let us enquire, and &s;hew particularly,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> How the Son of God was &s;lain.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> How his blood is a mean of our redemption to God. And,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Wherein his worthine&s;s or merit doth con&s;i&s;t, "Thou art worthy&mdash;for thou wa&s;t &s;lain; and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy blood."</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I am to &s;how, how the Son of God was &s;lain. And he was &s;lain as a <HI>victim</HI> a <HI>&s;acrifice.</HI> A &s;acrifice (in Heb.) is <HI>minchah,</HI> and pre&s;uppo&s;es a victim, a conque&s;t or victory, obtained over an enemy; and is that which is &s;lain, or that on which they fea&s;t, in triumph of the victory obtained. Thus, among ancient nations, when any one obtained a victory over an other in war; the conque|ror &s;uppo&s;ed he had a right to &s;lay the victim or conquered foe, and take their &s;ub&s;tance as a prey; and they &s;lew bea&s;ts, and prepared a fea&s;t of the &s;poils. And &s;ometimes among the barbarous, they fea&s;ted on the fle&s;h and blood of the victims; and this was called a <HI>&s;acrifice,</HI> or a fea&s;t upon a victim. <HI>Corban,</HI> (in Heb.) is any kind of <HI>gift</HI> or <HI>offering</HI> made to God. But <HI>Minchah</HI> is a <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> or <HI>fea&s;t upon a victim.</HI></P>
<P>And thus was Chri&s;t, the Son of God &s;lain, as a victim and &s;a|crifice in the devil's kingdom, by the hand of his enemies, in the exerci&s;e of all their &s;pight, enmity and malice to his moral cha|racter, as the HEIR of the kingdom. "This is the HEIR (&s;ay they) come let us kill him, and &s;eize on the inheritance."</P>
<P>By the determinate coun&s;el and foreknowledge of God the Fa|ther, he is delivered up, and &s;et forth to be a propitiation, i. e. a victim and &s;acrifice. And God the Son a&s;&s;umes human nature, and cloaths it with the moral perfections of his divine, on purpo&s;e to put his divine, moral character into the power of his enemies&mdash; And then this great <HI>Theanthropos,</HI> as the high prie&s;t under the law, <HI>offers</HI> up him&s;elf&mdash;to be made a victim and &s;acrifice, by his ene|mies&mdash;and they with <HI>wicked hands</HI> did to him, what ever God's hand and coun&s;el determined before to be done; not as pa&s;&s;ive wea|pons in the hand of God the Father; but as free, di&s;tinct agents from God; who could form their own de&s;igns, and execute them,
<PB N="14" REF="020704_0013_0FB0A63916B6A6C8">
in oppo&s;ition to God's de&s;igns, in carrying on this war. And they fir&s;t conquer him, and then &s;acrifice and &s;lay him, and tri|umph in their conque&s;t. They fir&s;t &s;lay him in a <HI>moral &s;en&s;e</HI>&mdash;i. e. deprive him of his divine moral character, in the view of his mo|ral &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The <HI>moral character</HI> of a holy being is his <HI>life</HI> in a moral &s;en&s;e&mdash; And the divine character of Chri&s;t, as moral Governor, &s;uffered in an infinite degree when he hung upon the cro&s;s; and his enemies denied his divinity; and challenged his veracity&mdash;&s;aying, "He &s;aid, he was the Son of God"&mdash;and, "If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cro&s;s, and we will believe"&mdash;and he appear|ed to be &s;o under the power of his enemies, that he was unable to &s;ave him&s;elf, or vindicate his character from the&s;e reproaches and &s;landers&mdash;And &s;ays, "This is your hour, and the power of dark|ne&s;s." And this was all the death it was po&s;&s;ible for any one to die, in a <HI>moral &s;en&s;e.</HI> It was not po&s;&s;ible for the Deity to &s;uffer in his e&s;&s;ence: But God the Son could, and did &s;uffer to an infinite degree in his divine and moral character as the Governor of the univer&s;e, in the view of his moral &s;ubjects, when he hung on the cro&s;s. But all the reproach was wiped off by his re&s;urrection from the dead, in the view of all that believed that he aro&s;e. By his re|&s;urrection from the dead, he was declared to be the Son of God with power&mdash;and the truth of all he &s;aid, concerning his Father's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and his own divinity, was confirmed.</P>
<P>This death, which the Son of God &s;uffered, in the reproaches ca&s;t on his divine character, when he was obliged to endure the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, was the mo&s;t bitter ingredient in all the cup that his Father put into his hand to drink. The pro&s;pect of this overwhelmed his <HI>holy, benevolent</HI> &s;oul, in the garden. When God the Son repre&s;ented to his human &s;oul, the great evil of &s;in, as it ca&s;ts &s;uch infinite reproach on the divine character as moral Governor, the infinite di&s;plea&s;ure of God again&s;t it, and the dreadful con&s;equences of it to the damned: This put him into an agony, and cau&s;ed him to &s;weat drops of blood, and &s;ay, "Now is my &s;oul troubled;" all out of love to holine&s;s and benevolence to &s;inners, and a &s;en&s;e of their &s;in and danger, and his de&s;ire of their &s;alvation. And when his enemies reproach him, and in&s;ult him, as if he was for&s;aken of God, becau&s;e he was not re&s;cued from the cro&s;s; "He tru&s;ted in God (&s;ay they) let him deliver him if he would have." This was a very cutting part of his &s;ufferings, that they &s;hould be made the occa&s;ion of &s;uch a thought as this, that God had for&s;aken him, and that there was no help for him in God&mdash; This cau&s;es the human nature of Chri&s;t to cry to God the Son, in the exerci&s;e of a mo&s;t &s;teadfa&s;t <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of his love and union with him, and continuance of his <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in his power and grace. "My God,
<PB N="15" REF="020704_0014_0FB0A63A63B140B8">
my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me!" i. e. in the view of my ene|mies, which hath given them occa&s;ion thus to reproach and in&s;ult my confidence in thee&mdash;not that the Son had in him&s;elf any <HI>di&s;tru&s;t</HI> of God's power or love and favour; or apprehen&s;ion of any <HI>real</HI> de|&s;ertion or dereliction of his Father. This is not the cry of God the Son to God the Father; but of the human nature to God the Son, who was the God and Father and Creator of his human nature, and was now in an intimate union with it. For God the Son could not in any &s;en&s;e be <HI>for&s;aken</HI> of God the Father.</P>
<P>His enemies al&s;o &s;lay his body by crucifying him in a mo&s;t igno|minious, cruel and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing manner; and this being in union with his divine nature&mdash;and being put to death out of enmity to his divine and moral character as the <HI>heir</HI> of the kingdom, exceed|ingly aggrevate his &s;ufferings, and the &s;in of his crucifiers. And the Son of God <HI>willingly</HI> &s;ubmits to be thus conquered and &s;lain by his enemies, in the exerci&s;e of the greate&s;t humility, patience, meekne&s;s and conde&s;cention; and is, by them, "Brought as a lamb to the &s;laughter, and as a &s;heep dumb before her &s;hearers; and &s;o he opened not his mouth." He laid down his life of him|&s;elf, though he was not his own executioner, nor did he create the &s;in of his crucifiers.</P>
<P>To this victim and &s;acrifice of the Son of God, all the victims and &s;acrifices under the law, had reference; and e&s;pecially the lamb &s;lain for a burnt offering. The&s;e were all, but &s;o many pro|phecies and types of this <HI>real</HI> victim and <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> of the Son of God incarnate&mdash;they all point to this&mdash;and are &s;uited to direct the mind of the offerer from his own merit and righteou&s;ne&s;s, to the merit of this victim and &s;acrifice for &s;in, conquered and &s;lain by his enemies; when he was &s;ub&s;tituted by God, to make atonement for &s;in, by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf; and did actually &s;acrifice his li|berty, life and glory to redeem ours. His &s;ufferings were vicari|ous. And wherever a <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> is mentioned in &s;cripture, it pre|&s;uppo&s;es &s;uch a victim or conque&s;t. The bea&s;t, before it was &s;lain for a &s;acrifice, evidently repre&s;ented &s;uch a victim, and was &s;o call|ed. It was to be con&s;idered as a conquered foe, lead forth to be &s;lain, and patiently &s;ubmitting to the &s;acrificial knife. And when the Lord is &s;aid to have a &s;acrifice in Bozrah, a conque&s;t of enemies is pre&s;uppo&s;ed, and this is a fea&s;t in triumph of &s;uch a conque&s;t. The bread and wine brought forth by Melchizedek to Abraham, was a fea&s;t upon a conque&s;t. And the invitation of wi&s;dom, Prov. ix. 5. "Come eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled," is to repre&s;ent a fea&s;t upon a victim. "Wi&s;dom hath killed her victims;" as you may &s;ee ver. 2.</P>
<P>And the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper is a fea&s;t upon the vic|tim, and &s;acrifice of the Son of God, by his enemies, by which
<PB N="16" REF="020704_0015_0FB0A63C0E58AF08">
means he obtained a compleat victory over them, and will finally &s;acrifice them all, if they &s;ubmit not in heart to his government. And the Lord's &s;upper is de&s;igned to repre&s;ent this victim and &s;a|crifice of the Son of God, by his enemies; and the conque&s;t he ob|tains over them, in this way. And this wonderful tran&s;action we celebrate in that &s;acred fea&s;t! How the ble&s;&s;ed God, when he &s;et forth his Son to be a propitiation, i. e. a victim and &s;acrifice, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s; was &s;o well plea&s;ed for his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake&mdash;that he pa&s;&s;ed over belie|vers in the execution of his wrath; and cau&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure to fall on their enemies; as was the ca&s;e in Egypt, in con&s;equence of the &s;acrifice and &s;prinkling of blood. To this the Apo&s;tle refers, i. Cor. v. 7.8. "For even Chri&s;t our pa&s;&s;over is &s;acrificed for us; therefore, let us keep the fea&s;t." And hence Chri&s;t is called the <HI>Hila&s;teerion,</HI> or mercy &s;eat, and the propitiation; becau&s;e he interpo&s;ed him&s;elf between the wrath of God and cur&s;e of the law, and his people, and renders him propitious. The mercy-&s;eat was that which covered the ark of the covenant, in which the tables of the Law were depo&s;ited;&mdash;upon this mercy-&s;eat God is repre&s;ented as &s;etting between the cherubim, that were fixed on each end of this &s;eat, &s;o as to form a throne with their wings; and this mercy-&s;eat, and the&s;e cherubim, were of pure gold. And as this mercy-&s;eat, or propitiation, came between God and the law, that con|tained the cur&s;e; &s;o Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as our Mediator, by being made a victim, &s;acrifice, or a cur&s;e for us, interpo&s;eth him&s;elf between God our Judge, and the law by which we &s;tand condemned and cur&s;ed; and by being made &s;uch a cur&s;e, i. e. a victim and &s;acri|fice for us, delivers us from the cur&s;e of the law, and renders God propitious.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We are to con&s;ider, how his <HI>blood</HI> is a mean of our re|demption to God. By his <HI>blood</HI> here we are to under&s;tand all he &s;uffered while here upon earth, in his divine character, and his hu|man nature as the HEIR of the kingdom and moral Governor of the univer&s;e. The <HI>blood</HI> &s;ignifies the <HI>life</HI>; and in taking away his divine character as moral Governor, they took away his liber|ty, his <HI>life</HI> and glory. And had not this been taken away, the &s;hedding his blood, and the &s;ufferings he endured in his human na|ture, would have been of no avail in making atonement for &s;in.&mdash; The infinite evil of &s;in, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, would not have been declared, nor his <HI>infinite wrath</HI> and <HI>di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> again&s;t &s;in been manife&s;ted, or his love to holine&s;s di&s;played by his death, or adequate &s;atisfaction made.</P>
<P>And the way in which the blood of Chri&s;t is a mean of our re|demption to God, is in that, hereby God's righteou&s;ne&s;s is mani|fe&s;ted and declared to all that have &s;aith in his blood, as the life of
<PB N="17" REF="020704_0016_0FB0A63DB36BAA70">
the Son of God taken away for &s;in: And that &s;in is both the <HI>procu|ring</HI> and <HI>in&s;trumental</HI> cau&s;e of his death. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of God hath been declared by the law, as hath been &s;hewn, and it hath been witne&s;&s;ed by the prophets.</P>
<P>And the Son of God declared, by his preaching, the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of God's character, law and government. This was the grand theme of his preaching, as a teacher &s;ent from God,&mdash;and he con|firmed his mi&s;&s;ion by miracles&mdash;and in him all the prophecies of the old te&s;tament were accompli&s;hed. And he declared the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of the law, by his yielding a &s;inle&s;s obedience to it, in human nature, to all that believed in his divinity: For &s;urely that mu&s;t be a holy, righteous and good law, to which the Son of God him&s;elf yields a perfect and &s;inle&s;s obedience. Whoever believes his divinity, will not doubt of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, to which he paid &s;uch great re&s;pect.</P>
<P>But this righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, which was witne&s;&s;ed by the law and the prophets, and which was confirmed by the preaching and obedience of our Saviour&mdash;is manife&s;ted without the law, by this victim and &s;acrifice, in a more con&s;picuous and convincing manner to all that believe in Chri&s;t. Every branch of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s is declared to all that &s;hall be convinced, that this was the blood of the Son of God, a per&s;on of infinite dignity and merit. As all &s;hall be convinced of it, either in this world for their &s;alvation, or at the day of judgment for their eternal condemnation and puni&s;h|ment&mdash;Then both men and devils &s;hall be convinced of this truth, by the blood of Chri&s;t, that the judgment of God, in condemning &s;inners to eternal death, for their &s;in and di&s;obedience, is accord|ing to truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. By this mean the infinite <HI>benevo|lence</HI> of God is declared; which is one very important branch of his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The benevolence of God, was manife&s;ted in the law (as hath been &s;hewn) but how much more fully manife&s;ted in the blood of Chri&s;t? For God not to &s;pare his &s;on, infinitely dear to him, but to &s;ub&s;titute him to make &s;atisfaction for &s;in, as our &s;urety, and deliver him up for us all&mdash;for &s;inners, for enemies, and when we as &s;heep were gone a&s;tray, to lay on him the iniquities of us all; to impute to him that immen&s;e debt we owed to divine ju&s;tice, that he might &s;atisfy for it&mdash;that it &s;hould plea&s;e the Father to brui&s;e him and put him to grief, by delivering him up out of his bo&s;om, into the hands of his enemies, to be wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and brui&s;ed for our iniquities, when the cha&s;tizement of our peace was on him, that by his &s;tripes we might be healed&mdash;that he &s;hould wake up the malice and rage of his enemies again&s;t him, by the manife&s;tation of truth to their con&s;ciences, &s;aying, "Awake, O &s;word, again&s;t my &s;hepherd, again&s;t the man that is my fellow"&mdash;
<PB N="18" REF="020704_0017_0FB0A63F090791B8">
what great benevolence mu&s;t it manife&s;t! For though God the Fa|ther was not him&s;elf the executioner, or inflictor of any &s;ufferings on his Son, by his decree, efficiency or command&mdash;nor was the Son ever the object or victim of his Father's wrath, but always the object of his infinite love, under his greate&s;t &s;ufferings; yet, <HI>in de|livering him up into the hands of his enemies,</HI> to be made a victim and &s;acrifice by them for the cau&s;e of truth, meekne&s;s and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, the Father &s;ignified his plea&s;ure that he &s;hould &s;uffer in this manner, as &s;ully as if he had him&s;elf inflicted the&s;e &s;ufferings on his Son: So that it may with great propriety be &s;aid, that it <HI>plea|&s;ed</HI> the Father to brui&s;e him, and put him to grief, "and we e&s;|teemed him &s;tricken and &s;mitten of God;"&mdash;for his enemies could have done nothing, unle&s;s it had been given them from above, and the Father and the Son had put him in their power: And therefore his &s;uffering in this manner is a wonderful proof and manife&s;tation of the love of God, who &s;et him forth to be a propitiation for &s;in.</P>
<P>The benevolence or love of God, is not the effect, but the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t's coming into the world, and &s;uffering what he did in it. Chri&s;t did not die to purcha&s;e the love of God to &s;inners, or to in|cline him to love them, and exerci&s;e mercy and grace to them, but to open the way for God freely to exerci&s;e his grace to &s;inners, con|&s;i&s;tently with his ju&s;tice. "God &s;o loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son." See John iii. 16.17. And the Apo&s;tle John &s;peaks of it, as being as great an expre&s;&s;ion and proof of God's love, and benevolence, as if God had laid down his own life. See i. John iii. 16. "Hereby perceive we the love of God, becau&s;e HE laid down his life for us." The character of any being is his life in a <HI>moral &s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>No being, but one of infinite benevolence, would part with a &s;on &s;o dear to him, and equal to him&s;elf, in every divine perfection, and deliver him up into the hands of his enemies, to be treated by them in &s;uch an ignominious, cruel manner, for the &s;ake of opening a way for the &s;alvation of rebellious &s;inners. Had God &s;ent his Son merely to yield obedience to his holy law, without requiring any &s;ufferings, his love to &s;inners would not have appeared &s;o great; becau&s;e this would have been ea&s;y, and honourable, and no &s;elf-denial would have been exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>And the divine benevolence, is manife&s;ted not only in God's &s;end|ing his Son to bear our &s;ins, and &s;uffer in our room and &s;tead; but al&s;o in the Son's con&s;enting to become a &s;ervant, and freely offer up him&s;elf, and &s;ubmit to &s;uch great humiliation and &s;ufferings, in or|der to work out our redemption. His great love and benevolence to &s;inners&mdash;his relation to them, and the de&s;ire he had of their &s;al|vation&mdash;was the occa&s;ion of all that overwhelming di&s;tre&s;s and &s;or|row of his &s;oul, that great agony and bloody &s;weat he endured in

the garden, when he cried out, "What &s;hall I &s;ay! Father deli|ver me from this hour?" (No) 'For this cau&s;e came I to this hour:' (But this I will &s;ay) "Father glorify thy name." Here was the travel of his &s;oul in bringing many &s;ons to glory. He felt for &s;inners the evil of &s;in, its turpitude and guilt, and the di&s;plea&s;ure of God again&s;t <HI>them</HI> on account of &s;in, more than they could feel for them&s;elves, by rea&s;on of his great love to them. No tender and indulgent parent could feel &s;o much for a beloved child, when ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to &s;uffer a mo&s;t &s;hameful, dreadful death from the hand of ju&s;tice, as Chri&s;t now felt for &s;inners; as they were polluted, guilty and ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to the wrath and vengeance of Almighty God. And thus by &s;ympathy, as well as otherwi&s;e, he bore our &s;ins; when he made <HI>&s;atifaction for them.</HI> And what great love and benevolence to &s;inners mu&s;t it argue, for the Son of God to engage in &s;uch a war, with all the powers of earth and hell for the &s;ake of redeeming &s;inners, enemies, when he knew it would co&s;t him his liberty, life and glory! "Greater love hath no man, than that a man lay down his life for his friend; but God hath commended his love to us, that while we were enemies Chri&s;t died for us."</P>
<P>And the <HI>inflexible ju&s;tice</HI> of God (which is another branch of his righteou&s;ne&s;s) is manife&s;ted and declared, in that God will not pardon, ju&s;tify and relea&s;e the &s;inner from the puni&s;hment, unle&s;s a &s;atisfaction be made by the &s;urety, adequate to the damages he hath &s;u&s;tained by &s;in, in the honour of his character and the inte|re&s;t of his kingdom, as moral governour.</P>
<P>And his <HI>truth</HI> expre&s;&s;ed in the threatening, is declared to be <HI>inviolable</HI> in that no &s;inner can be pardoned and ju&s;tified on ac|count of this &s;atisfaction, 'till he is united to the Redeemer by faith in his blood, and &s;o is intere&s;ted in his merit. And then God can exerci&s;e his grace freely in pardoning and ju&s;tifying the &s;inner, con&s;i&s;tent with his ju&s;tice, as you may &s;ee Rom. iii. 23, 24, 25, 26. "For all have &s;inned, come &s;hort of the glory of God; being ju&s;tified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation thro' faith in his blood, to <HI>declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins&mdash;that he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him that believ|eth in Je&s;us." And by this law of faith all boa&s;ting is excluded, becau&s;e the believer receives the righteou&s;ne&s;s by which he is ju&s;ti|fied by <HI>faith alone</HI>: "It is by faith that it might be by grace"</P>
<P>And God the Son, by thus declaring his Father's righteou&s;ne&s;s in being made a propitiation (i. e. a victim and &s;acrifice) for &s;in hath judged, condemned, conquered and de&s;troyed all God's ene|mies; and decided the grand moral controver&s;y; and layed a &s;ure foundation to put an eternal end to the war.

that implacable enemy to God and his moral kingdom, is condemn|ed and the dominion and power of it de&s;troyed. Every one that really believes that Chri&s;t was the Son of God, mu&s;t be convinced, by his death, that &s;in is an infinite evil in its nature and tendency&mdash; that it is pregnant with moral enmity to God, and mi&s;chief to his moral kingdom; and would dethrone God, and de&s;troy him as moral governor, and ruin his kingdom, if it had &s;ufficient power on its &s;ide. The devil knew that Chri&s;t was the holy one of God, that he was the <HI>heir</HI> of the kingdom, and that he came to be the Saviour of the world, and this was his motive in putting him to death: and it was in the devil's kingdom, by his &s;ubjects, and un|der his influence that the Lord of Life and Glory was crucified. See Rev. xi. 8. And &s;in, or the temper of the devil, and his di&s;|po&s;ition to oppo&s;e God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, was never acted out in per&s;ecuting the &s;aints, or in &s;laying the prophets, or at any other time, as it was in the crucifixion of the Son at God. Satan and his &s;ubject &s;ay, "This is the <HI>heir,</HI> come let us kill him and &s;eize on the inheritance." Now doth not this evidently &s;how &s;in to be an infinite evil? and con&s;equently that it is a holy, ju&s;t and good law, that threatens it with an infinite or endle&s;s puni&s;hment, in mi&s;erably de&s;troying Satan's kingdom and &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>And in the death of Chri&s;t the <HI>devil,</HI> as the prince of this world, is judged, condemned, conquered and de&s;troyed in a moral &s;en&s;e. See John xii. 31, 32, and xvi. 11. And how this is effected by the death of Chri&s;t, appears in that ancient prediction of this war, Gen. iii. 15. "It &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;hall brui&s;e his heel." Here it is foretold how the devil, by making the Son of God, in human nature, his victim and &s;acrifice for a time, brui&s;ed Chri&s;t's heel; and by conquering and &s;laying Chri&s;t, the &s;eed of the wo|man, the devil, de&s;troyed him&s;elf in a moral &s;en&s;e. Je&s;us Chri&s;t by &s;ubmitting to be conquered and &s;lain in the devil's kingdom broke the &s;erpent's head, laid open all his wicked de&s;igns again&s;t the character and kingdom of God; and de&s;troyed Satan's power and dominion over the hearts of men. The Son of God by his death upon the cro&s;s, and his re&s;urrection from the dead, conquered the devil, expo&s;ed him openly, and di&s;armed him at once, of all three of his weapons, the cur&s;e of the law, the &s;trength of &s;in, and the power of death; and led him at his chariot wheels, as a victim and captive. See Co<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. ii. 5. And thus he de&s;troyed him that had the power of death; and delivers tho&s;e who through fear of death were all their life time &s;ubject to bondage. And Sam&s;on, in this, was a lively type of Chri&s;t: by being conquered him&s;elf, he con|quered the enemies of his people; and by being &s;lain he &s;lew them.

<P>"He did not cry nor &s;trive, neither did any man hear his voice in the &s;treet&mdash;he did not break the brui&s;ed reed nor quench the &s;moaking flax, 'till he brought forth judgment unto victory." See I&s;a. xl. 1, 2. compared with Mat. xii. 17, 18.</P>
<P>And in I&s;a. lxiii. we have a remarkable prophecy of this war, and how it was decided, and all his enemies &s;lain&mdash;and a fea&s;t up|on a victim or &s;acrifice prepared in Bozrah.

"And I &s;aw, and behold a white hor&s;e, and he that &s;at on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him; and he went forth conquering and to conquer." This white hor&s;e repre&s;ents the go&s;pel.

<P>And Rev. xix. We have an account of the de&s;truction he makes by his word and &s;pirit of truth, of all his implacable and incurable enemies; who will not &s;ubmit to the &s;ceptre of his grace. The battle here de&s;cribed is a deci&s;ive one; and the mo&s;t bloody and awful battle that ever was or will be fought: and this is of a mor|al kind.

<P>The de&s;ign of the Son of God's coming into this world, and being made a victim and &s;acrifice in the devil's kingdom, was not only to open a way for God to di&s;play his free and &s;overeign grace, in the &s;alvation of all that believe in him, but al&s;o that he may di&s;play his wrath and vindictive vengeance in executing judg|ment upon devils, and upon all among the children of men that &s;hall ob&s;tinately reject his Son, and finally continue in &s;in and un|belief.

And he introduces his fir&s;t begotten Son, (i. e. one that was of the &s;ame nature and e&s;&s;ence, and <HI>likene&s;s</HI> in all perfections with him&s;elf, and infinitely near and dear to him, and heir of all things, and worthy of equal honour with him&s;elf) with this command&mdash;Let all the angels of God wor&s;hip him!&mdash;Some of the angels refu&s;ed to put an <HI>implicit</HI> faith in God's word, and yield an <HI>implicit</HI> obedience to his commands, and &s;o became tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of a <HI>known</HI> command of their infinitely wi&s;e and benevolent Creator. And in con&s;equence of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, they became &s;inners, and were by <HI>&s;in transformed</HI> into devils, and filled with error, pride and en|mity to God and holine&s;s. God never made a <HI>&s;in</HI> or a <HI>devil</HI>&mdash;God made tho&s;e who are now <HI>devils, holy angels,</HI> in his own moral image; but <HI>they made</HI> &s;in, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o <HI>made them&s;elves devils.</HI> And the &s;cripture no where tells us, that &s;in is the <HI>work</HI> or creature of <HI>God,</HI> but expre&s;sly tells us that it is the <HI>work</HI> of the devil. See John viii. 44. "The devil was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becau&s;e there is no truth in him. When he &s;peaketh <HI>a lie,</HI> be &s;peaketh of his <HI>own</HI>; for he is a liar, and the <HI>father of it."</HI> And the devil is in this &s;en&s;e the <HI>father</HI> of error, &s;in
<PB N="25" REF="020704_0024_0FB0A6495FE65220">
and &s;inners. And he that <HI>maketh</HI> &s;in is of the devil; for the devil &s;inneth from the beginning. For this purpo&s;e the Son of God was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the <HI>works</HI> of the devil." But if <HI>error</HI> and <HI>&s;in</HI> are the <HI>works</HI> of God, <HI>created</HI> by him; then we &s;hould read thus&mdash;" For this purpo&s;e the Son of God was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the <HI>works of God</HI>&mdash;works which God <HI>created</HI> and <HI>made:"</HI> but who doth not &s;ee the <HI>bla&s;phemy</HI> of this? (But this is ac|cording to Home's ideal &s;cheme.)</P>
<P>And as God did not make or create &s;in in <HI>forming</HI> or executing his decrees, or by his immediate efficiency; &s;o neither is he the au|thor of it by his <HI>commands,</HI> or by <HI>tempting</HI> his creatures with evil. "Out of the <HI>mouth</HI> of the Mo&s;t High doth not <HI>evil</HI> and good pro|ceed." See Lam. iii. 38. "Let no man &s;ay, when he is tempt|ed, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted, neither tempteth he any man, with evil." "But every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights," &amp;c. See James i. 13.17 All <HI>error</HI> and <HI>&s;in</HI> or <HI>wicked|ne&s;s,</HI> is from the devil, the father of <HI>darkne&s;s</HI>; and all <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is from God, the <HI>Father of lights.</HI> If God created the &s;in and enmity of wicked men and devils, and all their rebellion&punc; he mu&s;t carry on <HI>both &s;ides</HI> of the war, and act in direct <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to him&s;elf; and if he is the <HI>author,</HI> he can manife&s;t no glory of vindic|tive ju&s;tice in <HI>puni&s;hing</HI> the &s;inner for it. God permits &s;in, and overrules it for his own glory. But God made angels and men holy and upright&mdash;and he was not <HI>acce&s;&s;ary</HI> to their original &s;in or apo&s;ta|cy. He did not create their &s;in by his decree or efficiency; nor did he <HI>command them to &s;in</HI>&mdash;nor did he induce or incline them to &s;in by tempting them with evil&mdash;nor did he <HI>corrupt</HI> their <HI>moral prin|ciple,</HI> or withdraw or withhold from them, that fell, any divine in|fluences that were nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;tanding, (which he granted to tho&s;e that &s;tood) until they did wilfully tran&s;gre&s;s a <HI>known,</HI> po&s;i|tive command. The angels might take the Son of God to be a creature; and for that rea&s;on refu&s;e to pay divine wor&s;hip to him; but this was to &s;et up their <HI>own rea&s;on</HI> in oppo&s;ition to an <HI>known, ex|pre&s;s command</HI> of God, which is &s;ubver&s;ive of all moral government. And man, under the influence of &s;atan, <HI>di&s;believed</HI> the threatening, and &s;o was embolden to tran&s;gre&s;s. But this was not becau&s;e God withdrew or withheld the holy &s;pirit or any internal divine influen|ces from them, before they tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. But immediately upon tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, all divine favour and influences of the holy &s;pirit were withdrawn in a <HI>judicial</HI> way; and then the <HI>moral principle</HI> be|came <HI>totally corrupt.</HI> But God hath been plea&s;ed, in his &s;overeign grace, to make provi&s;ion for the re&s;toration of mankind, and to con|vey to them the holy &s;pirit by the revelation of the go&s;pel; &s;o that all who will <HI>hear</HI> and <HI>under&s;tand</HI> the go&s;pel, and <HI>receive</HI> the truths of it by faith and love, may be &s;aved: and if they do not hear and
<PB N="26" REF="020704_0025_0FB0A64E6FBEB3B8">
under&s;tand, &amp;c. they will be left without excu&s;e, if they enjoy the <HI>means</HI> of knowledge and grace.&mdash;And &s;hould any enquire, why did not <HI>all</HI> the angels tran&s;gre&s;s, if they all were equal as to divine influences?&mdash;To this I an&s;wer, it is probable &s;ome waited till they &s;aw the effect of apo&s;tacy in others before they refu&s;ed obedience; and this opened their eyes and prevented their fall, and confirmed them in obedience. And it is probable, that if Adam had waited 'till he &s;aw the effect of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in Eve, and the angels that &s;inned, he never would have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, but been confirmed in holine&s;s, as the &s;aints will in heaven, to all eternity, by the pu|ni&s;hment of &s;inners in hell. This is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>moral</HI> government.</P>
<P>Second, We may infer from what hath been &s;aid upon redemption, that tho&s;e do greatly err, who &s;ay, that the atonement and &s;atis|faction made by Chri&s;t, con&s;i&s;ts only in his <HI>obedience</HI> to the moral law, and that he did not die <HI>for our &s;ins,</HI> or in our room and &s;tead; but only for our &s;akes, or for our good and benefit, to &s;et us a per|fect example of patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under &s;ufferings. But if Je&s;us Chri&s;t was made a propitiation for &s;in; if he was &s;lain for us as our &s;acrifice; if he offered up him&s;elf to be a victim and &s;acrifice in order to declare God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and conquer and de&s;troy his enemies, that by the merit of his blood, the <HI>price</HI> of our re|demption might be paid, before our &s;ins could be remitted con&s;i&s;t|ent with the ju&s;tice of God&mdash;if he died, not only <HI>by</HI> the &s;ins of men, but <HI>for</HI> them: and his <HI>death</HI> is to be con&s;idered, not merely as a pledge to a&s;&s;ure us of the mercy of God, but as a real, proper vic|tim and &s;acrifice, wherein the legal victims and &s;acrifices had their final accompli&s;hment; then he mu&s;t have died in our room, and as &s;ub&s;tituted in our place, to di&s;charge our <HI>immen&s;e debt</HI> to ju&s;tice, which we contracted by our rebellion. The ends for which atone-were de&s;igned, could not have been an&s;wered by <HI>mere obedience,</HI> (as hath been &s;hewn) The infinite evil of &s;in, and the infinite di&s;plea|&s;ure of God again&s;t it; and his di&s;po&s;ition and determination to pu|ni&s;h it to all eternity; and the love of God and Chri&s;t to &s;inners, and many other important truths, could not have been expre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>mere obedience</HI> of an holy being to a holy law. And unle&s;s the&s;e truths had been manife&s;ted, &s;in could not have been pardoned, or one &s;inner ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God, con&s;i&s;tent with his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as moral Governor: So, true it is, that, "Without &s;hed|ding of blood, there can be no remi&s;&s;ion." The blood of Chri&s;t (not typical blood) doth truly and properly atone for, and take away &s;in. He died for our &s;ins, as our &s;ub&s;titute, in our &s;tead, as the &s;acrifices under the law, did for the &s;ins, and in the &s;tead of the offenders.</P>
<P>Third, We may infer, that there is a trinity of per&s;ons in the God-head. This is a doctrine denied by many at this day, becau&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="020704_0026_0FB0A65029B4AA90">
they cannot &s;ee its con&s;i&s;tency with rea&s;on. The being and perfec|tions of one God, may be fully proved from the light of nature; but the <HI>trinity</HI> of per&s;ons or agents in the divine e&s;&s;ence, depends upon <HI>immediate revelation</HI> for its proof. And this doctrine is often repre&s;ented as a &s;peculative point, of no great importance, whether it be believed or not: &s;o my&s;terious and curious that it had better be let alone. But it is evident that it enters into our &s;alvation in all its parts&mdash;into all the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and into the expe|rience of the &s;aints. As &s;oon as ever a man is convinced of his &s;inful and mi&s;erable &s;tate by nature, he &s;ees that there is a Divine Per&s;on offended, and there needs another Divine Per&s;on to make &s;atisfaction for his offences, and a third to &s;anctify him.</P>
<P>And it is no more repugnant to rea&s;on, that three di&s;tinct agents &s;hould depend for their exi&s;tence upon one e&s;&s;ence; and exi&s;t eternal|ly and nece&s;&s;arily in one e&s;&s;ence&mdash;than that one infinite agent &s;hould exi&s;t eternally and nece&s;&s;arily without any cau&s;e of his exi&s;t|ence; or that thou&s;ands of di&s;tinct agents &s;hould depend on one will (the will of God) for their exi&s;tence. And when the &s;econd per&s;on in the &s;acred trinity is called a SON, <HI>an only begotten or fir&s;t born</HI> SON, the&s;e, I take, to be figurative expre&s;&s;ions, not to expre&s;s his <HI>work</HI> or <HI>office,</HI> but to denote his being of one and the &s;ame <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> with the Father, the expre&s;s <HI>likene&s;s</HI> of his per&s;on, infinitely dear to him, and the <HI>heir</HI> of all things equally with the Father; as children are of the &s;ame nature and image of their earthly parents, and &s;o exceedingly dear to them, and <HI>heirs,</HI> by birth, to their e&s;|tates. But the&s;e epithets are not de&s;igned, when applied to the &s;e|cond per&s;on in the Godhead, to expre&s;s any <HI>priority</HI> or <HI>&s;uperiority</HI> in the Father, or any will or act of the Father in <HI>generating</HI> or gi|ving exi&s;tence to the Son; as if the Son depended on the <HI>will</HI> or <HI>act</HI> of the Father for his exi&s;tence: For <HI>eternal generation</HI> or <HI>creation</HI> is a <HI>&s;oleci&s;m</HI> in &s;peech.</P>
<P><HI>Paraclet<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> or comforter, denotes <HI>work</HI> or <HI>office</HI> in the third per|&s;on of the trinity&mdash;and <HI>&s;ervant,</HI> Mediator, Surety, <HI>Advocate,</HI> &amp;c. denote <HI>work</HI> or <HI>office</HI> in the &s;econd per&s;on: but <HI>Father, Son</HI> or <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> are not de&s;igned to expre&s;s <HI>work</HI> or <HI>office,</HI> but nature, e&s;|&s;ence, &amp;c. And although God the Son took on him&s;elf the form of a &s;ervant, and engaged in the office of a Mediator, and became obedient to the Father in the covenant of redemption, even to the death; yet he was a <HI>Son</HI> by <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ence,</HI> and <HI>heir</HI> of all things, and &s;o equal with the Father, and the creator of all things, both in heaven and on earth. And where he is called the <HI>protokotos,</HI> ren|dered <HI>fir&s;t born</HI> of every creature; it &s;hould have been rendered fir&s;t <HI>progenitor</HI> of every creature; "for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible. And he is before all things, and by him all things con&s;i&s;t." See Col. i. 15.16.17. And not in re&s;pect to his office, but in re&s;pect to his
<PB N="28" REF="020704_0027_0FB0A651A0B2D1B0">
nature, e&s;&s;ence, heir&s;hip, likene&s;s and dearne&s;s to the Father, he is called a Son. But God doth not depend on his own <HI>will</HI> for his ex|i&s;tence, nor on the <HI>will</HI> of any other being, becau&s;e his exi&s;tence is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI>; nor do either of the per&s;ons in the &s;acred tri|nity depend on their own <HI>will,</HI> or the <HI>will</HI> or <HI>act</HI> of each other, for their exi&s;tence; but all exi&s;t <HI>eternally</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;arily,</HI> in one and the &s;ame e&s;&s;ence; though their agency and operations are di&s;tinct, free and limited by their wi&s;dom and will.</P>
<P>And that there is an eternal plurality of per&s;ons in the Godhead, &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;arily implied in the perfection of their happine&s;s; for happine&s;s lies not in &s;olitude, but in &s;ociety&mdash;and the &s;acred tri|nity mu&s;t have enjoyed infinite delight, communion, complacency and happine&s;s in them&s;elves, before any creature exi&s;ted. See Prov. viii. 30. And had not our Redeemer been God, a per&s;on of infinite dignity and merit, and under no previous obligation to o|bey, he could not have merited any thing at the hand of God.</P>
<P>No mere creature, by any thing he can do or &s;uffer, can merit of God by way of condignity, becau&s;e he owes his all to him, and can render nothing to God, but what he fir&s;t received from him; and he can never pay his own debt, for his exi&s;tence and happine&s;s, be he ever &s;o holy and obedient. The honour he brings to God, and the good he does to his moral kingdom, is &s;mall in compari&s;on of the benefits he receives from God&mdash;and when once he hath &s;inned, the merit of all the creatures in the univer&s;e could not make a|mends for the di&s;honour done to God's character by one &s;in: For God could not, con&s;i&s;tent with his ju&s;tice, pardon one &s;in for a me|rit of <HI>congruity,</HI> or <HI>out of re&s;pect to the tried virtue and obedience</HI> of all created beings; to do it would be an infinite reproach to his cha|racter.</P>
<P>And none but one of infinite perfections could conquer and &s;ub|due &s;atan, and triumph over all the powers of earth and hell, as the Son of God hath done, in order to make atonement; and who but a God could execute the office of a Redeemer? God's own arm brought &s;alvation! And the &s;cripture is abundant in the proof of this doctrine of a trinity.</P>
<P>Fourth. We infer that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of God, was well qualified for this work.&mdash;Je&s;us Chri&s;t was one to whom the rights of the Deity mu&s;t be exceeding dear; &s;o that he upon no account would &s;ee them violated in the lea&s;t degree; for he was him&s;elf God; and an holy God would tru&s;t no other in this affair, in which his own glory was &s;o nearly concerned. And he was a per&s;on of in|finite dignity and merit, and none but &s;uch an one could make a|tonement for &s;in. And he had a &s;incere and ardent love for &s;in|ners, and a great de&s;ire for their &s;alvation, &s;o that he was willing to take their de&s;truction upon him&s;elf, and expend as much of his own intere&s;t and happine&s;s for their &s;akes, as was equivalent to the who&s;e of theirs.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="020704_0028_0FB0A653423B8498">And how wonderful is this love and grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to &s;inners! Con&s;ider God the Son as &s;elf-exi&s;tent and independent on all his creatures for his happine&s;s, but <HI>rich</HI> in all the perfections and glories of the Deity&mdash;and what great love mu&s;t that be, that could move him to pay &s;uch regard to his creatures! Con&s;ider the world &s;unk in &s;in, without any good de&s;ert, but de&s;erving everla&s;t|ing puni&s;hment; and what wonderful love mu&s;t that be, that could move Him to have compa&s;&s;ion upon &s;uch a world, &s;o as to lay a&s;ide the robes of his glory and become <HI>poor,</HI> a&s;&s;ume human nature into a per&s;onal union with his divine, appear in our world, now become the &s;eat of the devil's kingdom! And con&s;ent to become a victim and &s;acrifice&mdash;be deprived of his liberty, life and glory, for the &s;ake of redeeming &s;inners! It was a great thing for Him to create this world for our re&s;idence&mdash;and be&s;tow upon us the bounties of his providence continually, with &s;uch a liberal hand! but what is it to &s;peak an all-creating word for our exi&s;tence, and to open his all-liberal hand for our &s;upport, in compari&s;on of &s;hedding the blood of his heart for our redemption!</P>
<P>Well may you that are the children of God cry out, "Behold what manner of love the Father hath be&s;towed on us!"</P>
<P>O let the love of Chri&s;t con&s;train you to live not to your&s;elves but to Him that hath loved you and died for you.</P>

<P>We propo&s;ed,</P>
<P N="1">I. TO &s;hew what is implied in our redemption to God.</P>
<P N="2">II. How the Son of God hath accompli&s;hed this work.</P>
<P N="3">III. Con&s;ider the honours conferred on him as the reward of his merit.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t of the&s;e propo&s;itions have been con&s;idered.&mdash;We have &s;hewn, that our redemption implies, that we are in a &s;tate of bondage&mdash;and the Son of God hath delivered us from that &s;tate. By our &s;in and rebellion, we have reproached the character of God as moral Governor, and &s;o have forfeited his favour, and our liberty, life and inheritance; and have incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure and the cur&s;e of the law, which is a confirmed &s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery, under the wrath of God forever. We have revolted from God, and are in the kingdom of the devil, and led captive by him. And we are unable of our&s;elves to pay the <HI>price</HI> of our redemption by mak|ing good the damages God hath received or &s;u&s;tained by &s;in, in the honour of his character, as moral Governour, and there|fore are liable to &s;uffer the penalty to all eternity; and we have neither inclination nor power to deliver our&s;elves from the <HI>power</HI> of &s;in and the <HI>tyranny</HI> of &s;atan. And from this &s;tate of guilt and corruption the Son of God redeems us. And in accompli&s;hing this work God the Son, as a divine agent, equal with God the Father, being &s;elf-exi&s;tent, &s;elf-&s;ufficient and independent on the <HI>will</HI> of God the Father for his exi&s;tence or happine&s;s, and un&s;ubordinate to him, freely took on him&s;elf the office of a Mediator and Redeem|er, and entered into a covenant of redemption. And by fulfilling
<PB N="31" REF="020704_0030_0FB0A656DC303F60">
the conditions of that covenant, in the execution of the offices of Prophet, Prie&s;t, and King, as God's &s;ervant and our Redeemer, hath procured an infinite, inexhau&s;tible fountain of merit with the Godhead, by vindicating, and bringing infinite honour to the character of God, as moral Governor, and &s;o infinite good to his moral kingdom. In this affair God the Father hath received more in <HI>value,</HI> by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Son, than he could have received by the perfect &s;ervice of angels, had they never &s;inned, or by inflicting the penalty of the law on devils and all mankind, for &s;in, to all eternity.&mdash; His benevolence, his wi&s;dom, his law, his ju&s;tice, his truth, and all his perfections are manife&s;ted, and proved in a more illu&s;trious manner.&mdash;So that God will lo&s;e no|thing in the honour of his character, law or government, by the &s;in of angels or men&mdash;or by di&s;pen&s;ing pardons freely to &s;inners through the merit and righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Son.</P>
<P>But, the Son of God not only redeems his cho&s;en people, by pay|ing the <HI>price</HI> of their ran&s;om to God; but, by the <HI>power</HI> of tho&s;e truths, manife&s;ted by his cro&s;s, accompanied with the influences of his &s;pirit, he redeems them from the <HI>power</HI> of <HI>&s;in,</HI> and <HI>tyranny</HI> of <HI>&s;atan.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. We proceed to con&s;ider, the honours conferred on our Redeemer, as the reward of his merit.&mdash;And all the honours and glory conferred on Chri&s;t, as the reward of his merit, are com|prehended in the&s;e words, in our text, "To take the book, and to open the &s;eals thereof." God the Father, hath delivered the kingdom of the univer&s;e into his power, "the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment unto the Son," &amp;c And that he may be able to govern, and di&s;po&s;e all things according to the divide plan, formed from eternity, in the divine mind, the book of God's eternal decrees, containing his whole plan of go|vernment, all the coun&s;els of infinite wi&s;dom, and all divine truth, are delivered into his hand, from the right hand of God the Father; and he hath undertaken to reveal and execute all the&s;e decrees. For God in <HI>forming</HI> his <HI>decrees</HI> produces no effects; creates no worlds, nor creatures, nor things whatever: the&s;e things are produced not in <HI>forming</HI> decrees in eternity, but in <HI>executing</HI> them in time. For, forming decrees implies no cau&s;ality in them. And this mediato|rial kingdom of Chri&s;t extends to all parts of the univer&s;e, that he may manage them all, &s;o as to advance his own glory, as moral Governor, and promote the good of his friends, and baffle and over|whelm all oppo&s;ition. And the holy &s;pirit, as the fruit of his in|finite merit, is appointed the great agent in his kingdom of grace, to reveal his will, and to operate with divine truth, to carry his purpo&s;es into execution. All the holy angels are mini&s;tering &s;pi|rits in his kingdom, to execute his orders in every part of his va&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="020704_0031_0FB0A6582366CA38">
empire. And the inanimate world is &s;ubjected to him; he cau&s;es the &s;un to &s;hine, the rain to fall, and the earth to yield her increa&s;e, to furni&s;h provi&s;ion for the &s;ubjects of his kingdom in this world; and all times and &s;ea&s;ons are at his controul. And the <HI>moral</HI> government of the univer&s;e is committed to him; he <HI>overrules</HI> all the wicked de&s;igns of devils to promote his own glory, and the good of his friends; though he doth not <HI>form</HI> or <HI>create</HI> any of their wicked de&s;igns. The government and di&s;po&s;al of the whole world of mankind, as moral agents, are committed to him, as a reward of his merit; and he will have the honour to di&s;po&s;e of them all according to his plea&s;ure, &s;o as to bring glory to his name. And the &s;ceptre of his kingdom, by which he rules moral agents, is <HI>truth</HI> &mdash;as he him&s;elf declares. "For this end was I born, and for this cau&s;e came I into the world, to be a witne&s;s to the truth&mdash;and all that are of the truth hear my voice." By the truth, accompanied with the holy &s;pirit, he enlightens, convinces and converts &s;ome, and makes them holy and happy. And by the manife&s;tation of the &s;ame truth, attended with the holy &s;pirit, he hardens and torments others to all eternity.</P>
<P>And in order to &s;pread abroad the <HI>truth,</HI> and communicate the &s;peculative knowledge of it, he employs &s;ome of the children of men, as the mini&s;ters of his word and ordinances, and the&s;e are workers together with him. And all among the children of men, that are delivered from the kingdom of darkne&s;s and tran&s;lated in|to the kingdom of his grace, &s;hall be accounted to him for &s;ons, and daughters&mdash;and of the&s;e he &s;hall have a numerous offspring at la&s;t to pre&s;ent before the throne with exceeding joy.</P>
<P>And all tho&s;e multitudes among the children of men, who con|tinue impenitent, and in unbelief, and in rebellion to his govern|ment, and enemies to his true character, belong to him as a reward of his merit, as much as his friends; he hath purcha&s;ed the&s;e, and will be glorified in them&mdash;"A&s;k of me (&s;ays God the Father) and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the ut|termo&s;t parts of the earth for thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Thou &s;halt break them with a rod of iron; thou &s;halt da&s;h them in pieces like a potter's ve&s;&s;el." P&s;al. ii. 8. So that the damnation of all may be as fully proved from the infinite merit of Chri&s;t with the Father, as the &s;alvation of all. The Son of God, by a merit of <HI>condignity,</HI> hath purcha&s;ed the honour of damning his enemies, as much as he hath of &s;aving his friends. It will be a great honour to Chri&s;t, at the la&s;t day, to pa&s;s the &s;entence of condemnation on wicked men, and devils; and &s;ay, "Go, ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire." And to execute it, by &s;aying. "Tho&s;e my enemies that would not that I &s;hould reign over them, bring them hither, and &s;lay them before me." And when the &s;moke of their torments &s;hall a&s;cend up for
<PB N="33" REF="020704_0032_0FB0A65A511A72D0">
ever and ever, all the heavenly ho&s;t will a&s;cribe glory to him, the glory of his vindictive ju&s;tice. So that none of the merit of Chri&s;t will be lo&s;t by the damnation of &s;inners; nor will Chri&s;t by this means lo&s;e any of his reward.</P>
<P>And Je&s;us Chri&s;t received great honour as a reward of his me|rit, when he aro&s;e from the dead. In his re&s;urrection he triumph|ed over death, and all the powers of earth and hell, and all the enemies of his people; and entered into his kingdom. In rai&s;ing Chri&s;t from the dead God &s;et to his &s;eal, that he had executed faithfully, the important commi&s;&s;ion he had received.</P>
<P>And Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his a&s;cention into heaven was di&s;tingui&s;hed with &s;ignal honours. Angels appeared, who proclaimed his a&s;cent; and that in the &s;ame manner he &s;hould de&s;cend again to judgment. See P&s;al. lxviii. 17.18.19.</P>
<P>And his reception into heaven, as a <HI>mighty conqueror,</HI> is repre|&s;ented in lofty expre&s;&s;ions, P&s;al. xxiv. 7.</P>
<P>And when he &s;at down on his Father's right hand in heaven, and was glorified with the &s;ame glory he had with his Father be|fore the world was, he received great honour, as a reward of his merit. In heaven he received the wor&s;hip and adoration of all the heavenly inhabitants, &s;aying, "Worthy is the Lamb that was &s;lain to take the book, and open the &s;eals thereof," &amp;c. "Ble&s;|&s;ing and honour and glory and power and &s;alvation be to him that &s;itteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever."</P>
<P>In heaven he appears as the advocate of his people; &s;howing the wounds that he hath received in his Father's cau&s;e, but not from his Father's hand, but from the hands of his enemies. And by vir|tue of his merit he makes prevalent interce&s;&s;ion for all that come to God by him. And he there reigns in maje&s;ty and glory, as King of kings; ve&s;ted with univer&s;al rule in the kingdom of na|ture, providence and grace. By his &s;pirit and truth he rides in the chariot of his go&s;pel conquering and to conquer; making his om|nipotent power appear in the dreadful famines, pe&s;tilence, wars and earthquakes; and all the judgments he &s;ends on the inhabi|tants of the earth; to draw their attention to the truth. And he will reign till he hath de&s;troyed the kingdom and power of darkne&s;s, by the efficacy of his word, and &s;pirit of truth. And in&s;tead of er|ror and wickedne&s;s, he will cau&s;e truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s to prevail; "Till the kingdom, and the greatne&s;s of the kingdom and domi|nion under the whole heavens &s;hall be given to the &s;aints of the mo&s;t high God." And the latter day glory of the church &s;hall fill the whole earth&mdash;and he &s;hall become king of nations, and he &s;hall reign a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>Thus hath God highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="020704_0033_0FB0A65B990983F0">And in a little time he &s;hall de&s;cend from heaven to judge the univer&s;e in righteou&s;ne&s;s.

And then &s;hall he &s;it on the throne of his glory, and all nations &s;hall be gathered before his augu&s;t tribunal. And he &s;hall declare the righteous judgment of God. And men, angels and devils &s;hall receive their final doom from the &s;entence of his mouth: Either "Come ye ble&s;&s;ed," or "Go ye cur&s;ed."

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> WE may learn from what hath been &s;aid, in what the atonement and &s;atisfaction of Chri&s;t con&s;i&s;ts. Some have &s;uppo&s;|ed that it con&s;i&s;ted only in Chri&s;t's <HI>obedience</HI> to the <HI>moral law.</HI> in human nature: and they &s;upport it by what the apo&s;tle affirms, Rom. v. 19. "For as by one man's di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners, &s;o by the <HI>obedience</HI> of one many &s;hall be made righte|ous." And his &s;ufferings (&s;ay they) were not de&s;igned to make &s;atisfaction, but only to expre&s;s the &s;trength of his obedience in the <HI>mo&s;t trying circum&s;tances.</HI> Others hold that the &s;atisfaction and merit of Chri&s;t con&s;i&s;ted principally, if not entirely, in his &s;uffering the individual penalty or cur&s;e, threatened to the &s;inner, in the <HI>moral law</HI> inflicted on him, by the immediate hand, decree or com|mand of God the Father; and as his human nature was in union with the divine, and a God of infinite power and perfections in|flicted the cur&s;e or penalty, this rendered his &s;ufferings infinitely meritorious, and &s;o &s;ufficient to make &s;atisfaction &amp; atonement for &s;in.</P>
<P>But now, is it not evident that the mere obedience of an holy being to the <HI>moral law,</HI> cannot make &s;atisfaction or avail for the remi&s;&s;ion of one &s;in: &s;ince without &s;uffering or &s;hedding of blood there is no remi&s;&s;ion? It was by the virtue of the <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> and <HI>death</HI> of the Son of God, in our room and &s;tead, that he made &s;atisfaction and atonement. And although Chri&s;t did yield a perfect and &s;in|le&s;s
<PB N="35" REF="020704_0034_0FB0A65CDF7085E0">
obedience to the moral law in human nature, yet, his merits, by which he made atonement, did not con&s;i&s;t in his <HI>obedience</HI> to the <HI>moral law.</HI> And the cur&s;e which Chri&s;t was made, was not the individual cur&s;e or penalty threatened to the &s;inner in the <HI>moral law</HI>; but the &s;ub&s;titute of it: as hath been &s;hewn; nor was it in|flicted by the hand, decree or command of his Father; but by his enemies, in exerci&s;e of enmity to his divine character. Had God the Father inflicted the cur&s;e, with his own hand, on the <HI>human</HI> nature of Chri&s;t thou&s;ands of ages, this would not have rendered his &s;ufferings infinite; for the infinite dignity, power, and perfecti|ons of the <HI>inflictor</HI> cannot make the &s;ufferings of a <HI>creature infinite,</HI> nor in any wi&s;e increa&s;e the <HI>merit</HI> of them; but really dimini&s;hes it. And the divine character could not &s;uffer by the hand of the Father. But all the&s;e difficulties vani&s;h, when we con&s;ider, that neither the obedience, or &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, by which he made atonement and &s;atisfaction for &s;in, and merited honour for him&s;elf and benefits for men, were required of him in the <HI>moral law,</HI> but in the <HI>mediatorial law,</HI> or <HI>covenant</HI> of <HI>redemption</HI>; which contained tho&s;e commands of God, to which he was &s;ubject, only as he was our mediator and &s;urety. As the obedience of the fir&s;t Adam, wherein his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s would have con&s;i&s;ted, if he had &s;tood, was not obedience to the moral law&mdash;but to a plain po&s;itive command, to ab&s;tain from the tree of knowledge of good and evil; which was not a com|mand contained in the moral law, but in a <HI>&s;pecial covenant</HI> or <HI>law,</HI> to which Adam was &s;ubject, as the moral head and &s;urety of all mankind; &s;o the obedience of the &s;econd Adam, in which his righteou&s;ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, lies not in his obedience to the moral law, to which he was &s;ubject merely as a man; but to that &s;pecial law or covenant of redemption, to which he was &s;ubject in his office, as mediator and &s;urety for man. And when the apo&s;tle &s;aith (as in the before cited Rom. v. 19.) "For as by one man's <HI>di&s;obedi|ence</HI> many were made &s;inners, &s;o by the <HI>obedience</HI> of one many &s;hall be made righteous." Neither the <HI>di&s;obedience</HI> of Adam, or the <HI>obedience</HI> of Chri&s;t, re&s;pect the <HI>moral law,</HI> but the&s;e &s;pecial covenants or laws to which they were &s;ubject as public heads, and &s;ureties. And to this law or covenant of redemption, and not to the moral law, the P&s;almi&s;t hath re&s;pect, P&s;alm xl. 6, &amp;c, "Sacrifice and of|fering thou did&s;t not de&s;ire; my ear ha&s;t thou opened: burnt offer|ing and &s;in offering ha&s;t thou not required. Then &s;aid I, lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy <HI>law</HI> is within my heart."</P>
<P>In this law or covenant of redemption the Father gave his Son commands to teach &s;uch doctrine, to preach the go&s;pel, to work &s;uch miracles, to call &s;uch di&s;ciples, to appoint &s;uch ordinances, and go through &s;uch humiliation, aba&s;ement and &s;ufferings, and
<PB N="36" REF="020704_0035_0FB0A65FA3CB2988">
at la&s;t to lay down his life; and he did all the&s;e things in obedi|ence to the commands he had received of his Father; not in the moral law, but in the covenant of redemption. To his obedience to this mediatorial law belongs his going through his la&s;t &s;ufferings, beginning with his agony in the garden, and ending with his re|&s;urrection from the dead. And he performed his <HI>obedience</HI> to this covenant, freely, perfectly and univer&s;ally, and under the greate&s;t trials and temptations, and in the exerci&s;e of infinite love to God, and the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and benevolence to man|kind. And his obedience and &s;ufferings, are not to be con&s;idered as being performed or indured by him, merely in human nature, but as <HI>God the Son,</HI> in his <HI>divine character</HI> as <HI>heir</HI> of the univer&s;e. It was a per&s;on of infinite dignity that obeyed and &s;uffered in his divine character&mdash;and this rendered his obedience and &s;ufferings <HI>infinitely meritorious.</HI> Not that he &s;uffered in his divine <HI>nature</HI> or <HI>e&s;&s;ence,</HI> but in his <HI>divine character,</HI> as <HI>Heir</HI> of the kingdom. In all that reproach and ignominy ca&s;t on his divine character by devils, and wicked men he &s;uffered. Had he not &s;uffered in his <HI>divine</HI> character, his &s;ufferings or &s;acrifice, would not have been <HI>infinite</HI> or &s;ufficient to make &s;atisfaction for one &s;in, or have an&s;wered the purpo&s;es of redemption. And the infinite virtue of his obedience con&s;i&s;ted in its being yielded to the covenant of redemption, as a divine per|&s;on&mdash;He, as God-man in the exerci&s;e of <HI>infinite love to God</HI> be|came obedient unto death. And in this <HI>obedience</HI> there was in|finite virtue and merit. And as his duty and work, &s;o his <HI>reward</HI> was a&s;&s;igned, and a&s;certained; not in the moral law, but in the covenant of redemption. And unle&s;s we attend to this di&s;tinction between the <HI>law</HI> of <HI>mediation,</HI> and the <HI>moral law,</HI> and the cur&s;e threatened to the &s;inner, and the cur&s;e which Chri&s;t was made, we cannot have a clear idea how Chri&s;t paid the price of our redempti|on to God by his blood. But here we can &s;ee how the <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> of Chri&s;t frees believers from mi&s;ery, as it pays their <HI>debt</HI> contrac|ted by &s;in; and how the <HI>merit</HI> of Chri&s;t by its <HI>intrin&s;ic value,</HI> and by the agreement between the Father and the Son, in the covenant of redemption, procures a title to happine&s;s, for all that believe in him. And here we may &s;ee the impropriety of applying the term <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> to any part of the <HI>obedience</HI> of Chri&s;t; &s;ince it was the <HI>obedience</HI> of God the Son to the covenant of redemption.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> We may infer, from what hath been &s;aid, that the merit of Chri&s;t the Son of God, is a merit of condignity. By a <HI>merit</HI> of <HI>condignity</HI> I under&s;tand, a merit that is <HI>equal</HI> in <HI>value</HI> to the <HI>reward.</HI> And we have heard what the reward is, which God the Father hath be&s;towed on the Son; and which he <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to him, not in the <HI>moral law,</HI> but in the <HI>covenant of redemption.</HI> And we have heard in what his merit con&s;i&s;ts. And let any one judge,
<PB N="37" REF="020704_0036_0FB0A6636768A368">
if the merit of the Son of God, con&s;idering the dignity of his per|&s;on, as being equal with God the Father, and independent on his <HI>will</HI> or <HI>act</HI> for his exi&s;tence or happine&s;s, and under no obligation from without him&s;elf, to obey, antecedent to his own voluntary con|&s;ent to the covenant of redemption, into which he entered with his Father. And con&s;idering the great honour he brought to God, and the good to his moral kingdom, which mu&s;t be of <HI>infinite value,</HI> and be e&s;teemed &s;o by God from eternity.</P>
<P>And con&s;idering the means and methods by which he procured this honour, and obtained this good; even by his <HI>infinite</HI> humilia|tion, arduous &s;ervices and great &s;ufferings; in &s;acrificing his liber|ty, life and <HI>divine glory</HI>; in being made a victim and &s;acrifice, in the devil's kingdom, in order to declare God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and execute judgement on God's enemies, and decide the moral controver&s;y, and put an end to the dreadful war; and advance God's glory, and promote the peace, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of his kingdom to an infinite degree: which great ends could by no other per&s;on or means be effected. I &s;ay, let any one judge, if this <HI>merit</HI> of the Son, is not equal to all the <HI>honours</HI> the Son hath re|ceived from God the Father for him&s;elf, and all the benefits men receive from God through him. And if &s;o, then his merit is a proper merit of <HI>condignity</HI>; and whatever he hath purcha&s;ed of the Father, he hath purcha&s;ed by an equivalent.</P>
<P>But this doth not imply that God hath received any new adition to his honour or felicity, or hath any increa&s;e of knowlege. For the&s;e were all comprehended in his infinite under&s;tanding, and compo&s;ed a part of his glory and happine&s;s, in <HI>eternity,</HI> and the <HI>va|lue</HI> was <HI>then received.</HI></P>
<P>Nor doth this imply that God is under any obligation to &s;ave all mankind. For, the &s;alvation of mankind doth not depend up|on the <HI>condignity</HI> or <HI>&s;ufficiency</HI> of the merit of the Son of God, but upon the <HI>agreement</HI> made between the Father and the Son, in the <HI>covenant</HI> of <HI>redemption,</HI> what his <HI>particular reward</HI> &s;hould be. The merit is <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> for, and <HI>equivalent</HI> to the &s;alvation of all; for it is of <HI>infinite value</HI> to God the Father, otherwi&s;e it would not have been &s;ufficient for the &s;alvation of one. But God the Father did not &s;ee cau&s;e to a&s;&s;ign the &s;alvation of all to him as his reward, in the covenant of redemption. God might have promi&s;ed him the &s;alvation of all as his reward, if he had &s;een it to be con&s;i&s;tent with his wi&s;dom, and his benevolence to his moral kingdom; but we are a&s;&s;ured he hath not; and that all will not eventually be &s;aved; for all will not repent, and believe in Chri&s;t; and he that believes not &s;hall be damned. God hath promi&s;ed him the free pardon, ju&s;ti|fication and &s;alvation of all that &s;hall believe on him, through his word acompanied by his &s;pirit of truth; and this &s;hall be a nume|rous
<PB N="38" REF="020704_0037_0FB0A66526648590">
offspring which he &s;hall pre&s;ent at la&s;t, before the throne, with exceeding joy; &s;aying, "Here am I, and the children thou ha&s;t given me." But <HI>all will</HI> not believe in Chri&s;t&mdash;but multitudes <HI>will</HI> remain enemies to him, and have to appear at his left hand, in the retinue of &s;atan, and hear the dreadful &s;entence from his mouth, "Go ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." And they will feel the execution of this dreadful &s;entence, when Chri&s;t &s;hall &s;ay, "Tho&s;e my enemies that would not that I &s;hould reign over them, bring them hither and &s;lay them before me." And to pa&s;s this &s;entence and to execute it on his enemies, will be as real a part of the reward of Chri&s;t's merit of condignity, as to pa&s;s the &s;entence of ab&s;olution and ju&s;tification, and be&s;tow rewards upon his friends. But Chri&s;t will be con&s;idered as having <HI>paid</HI> the <HI>price</HI> of the redemption of all the heirs of glory, by a proper merit of condignity; and to have <HI>purcha&s;ed</HI> their hap|pine&s;s by an equivalent: and they will to all eternity a&s;cribe the glory of their redemption to the <HI>price</HI> and <HI>power</HI> of his blood, as the Lamb &s;lain. Neither doth the <HI>condignity</HI> of Chri&s;t's merit detract any thing from the <HI>freene&s;s</HI> of divine grace, in the pardon and ju&s;tification of the &s;inner. <HI>Plenary &s;atisfaction</HI> and <HI>free pardon</HI> are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent on this plan. For, though what Chri&s;t hath done to make atonement &s;ecures the honour of God, the authority of the law, and the dignity and vigour of government, and con&s;e|quently the peace, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of his kingdom, in the &s;alvation of all that believe in Je&s;us; yet the atonement and &s;a|tisfaction made by Chri&s;t, and repentance of &s;in, and faith in his blood, do not alter the <HI>per&s;onal</HI> character of the &s;inner; &s;o as to cau&s;e him to <HI>cea&s;e</HI> to be a <HI>&s;inner,</HI> or a <HI>debtor</HI> to divine ju&s;tice, or to de&s;erve puni&s;hment, or give the &s;inner any <HI>claim</HI> to pardon, upon the &s;core of ju&s;tice. Even Chri&s;t him&s;elf could lay claim to the pardon and ju&s;tification of the &s;inner, notwith&s;tanding the condignity of his merit, <HI>only</HI> upon the foundation of the <HI>&s;tipulation</HI> or <HI>promi&s;e</HI> made to him by the Father, in the covenant of redempti|on; were it not for that <HI>promi&s;e</HI> and <HI>agreement,</HI> God the Son could lay no claim to that <HI>particular favour</HI> as his reward; though his merit was &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e it&mdash;yet God in his infinite wi&s;dom, and free and <HI>&s;overeign</HI> grace mu&s;t determine that <HI>this,</HI> &s;hall be his reward. And it was infinite love, unpurcha&s;ed, unmoved love (by any thing without him&s;elf) that determined God the Father to be&s;tow <HI>the&s;e</HI> as a reward upon his Son. The merit of the Son laid him under no obligation to make this di&s;tinction. He might have &s;ent his Son (as his reward) to condemn the whole world; they all de&s;erved it; but it was <HI>free</HI> and <HI>&s;overeign grace</HI> that prevented it.</P>
<P>And the <HI>believer</HI> in Je&s;us can lay no claim upon the &s;core of ju&s;tice. The merit of Chri&s;t, and the repentance, faith and love
<PB N="39" REF="020704_0038_0FB0A66765F19F80">
and good works of the believer, do not cau&s;e him to cea&s;e to be a &s;inner; or intitle him to the merit or righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, on account of any <HI>moral goodne&s;s</HI> there is in them. The believer doth not by the&s;e <HI>earn</HI> or <HI>merit</HI> any favour, but by <HI>faith</HI> he lays hold on the <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> and <HI>receives</HI> the atonement; and all the benefits of Chri&s;t's purcha&s;e. And were it not for the free <HI>promi&s;e</HI> the <HI>believ|er</HI> mu&s;t &s;till remain in a &s;tate of guilt and condemnation. But the believer can lay claim to the&s;e promi&s;es of the covenant of grace. But the <HI>merit</HI> of the <HI>believer,</HI> who is united to Chri&s;t by faith, is only a merit of <HI>congruity,</HI> i. e. <HI>a &s;uitablene&s;s to receive</HI> favours from a <HI>righteous</HI> God. And God can as con&s;i&s;tently ju&s;tify a <HI>believer in Chri&s;t,</HI> as he can <HI>Gabriel.</HI> But though a <HI>creature</HI> may have a merit of <HI>congruity,</HI> yet no creature can have a merit of <HI>condignity</HI> with re&s;pect to God; becau&s;e he is infinitely indebted to him, for his being, &amp;c. And therefore no creature could make atonement for &s;in, or purcha&s;e any favour of God, for him&s;elf or any other. Adam in innocency had, and all the holy angels in heaven now have, a merit of <HI>congruity.</HI> And could God have pardoned &s;in out of <HI>re&s;pect</HI> to the merit of <HI>congruity,</HI> or out of re&s;pect to the <HI>tried virtue</HI> of one who was under obligation from ju&s;tice, or any thing from without him&s;elf, antecedent to his own con&s;ent to obey; then there would have been no need of a per&s;on of <HI>infinite dignity,</HI> co-equal, co-e&s;|&s;ential and co-eternal with God the Father, to undertake this work. Becau&s;e an holy <HI>creature</HI> by his obedience and &s;ufferings might have accompli&s;hed it with the <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> of the <HI>Deity.</HI> And to deny the <HI>condignity</HI> of the merit of Chri&s;t, is in effect to deny his divini|ty, and equality with the Father. For, if one that had only a merit of <HI>congruity</HI> would have an&s;wered, to &s;ub&s;titute one that had a merit of <HI>condignity</HI> was not wi&s;e; becau&s;e it &s;uppo&s;es a needle&s;s expence of merit. The <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of &s;ub&s;tituting a per&s;on of infinite dignity, con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of it. But had not the Mediator been a per|&s;on of infinite and divine dignity, and his merit a merit of condig|nity with God, no atonement or &s;atisfaction could have been made by his obedience and &s;ufferings; out of re&s;pect to which God could have pardoned one &s;in, con&s;i&s;tent with his <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as moral Governour. And hence infinite wi&s;dom and benevolence is di&s;play|ed in this &s;ub&s;titution. "When he looked, there was none to help, &mdash;none to uphold; therefore his <HI>own arm</HI> brought &s;alvation unto him!" See I&s;a. lxiii. 5. But God in pardoning the &s;inner, out of re&s;pect to the merit of Chri&s;t, acts as <HI>freely</HI> as if no atonement had been made; &s;ince the atonement made by Chri&s;t or the condignity of the merit, laid God under no obligation to di&s;charge one &s;inner from his debt to ju&s;tice, antecedent to <HI>&s;tipulation</HI>: nor in the lea&s;t alter the <HI>per&s;onal</HI> character of the &s;inner. Nor can God, con&s;i&s;tent: with his ju&s;tice, pardon, ju&s;tify or &s;ave one &s;inner on account of the
<PB N="40" REF="020704_0039_0FB0A668E3B4ABB8">
infinite merit of Chri&s;t, 'till the &s;inner believeth in Je&s;us; and then he treats him infinitely more favourably than his <HI>per&s;onal</HI> character de&s;erves. But, the condignity of Chri&s;t's merit hath opened a way for the con&s;i&s;tent exerci&s;e of this <HI>free grace</HI> to the &s;inner&mdash;but laid God under no <HI>obligation</HI> to exerci&s;e it to any one.</P>
<P>And I would here ob&s;erve the di&s;tinction between <HI>free</HI> and <HI>&s;ove|reign</HI> grace.</P>
<P>UNCONDITIONAL FAVOURS, to which the &s;inner can lay no claim on the &s;core of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> or by any <HI>promi&s;e</HI> of God made to him, are be&s;towed on him in the exerci&s;e of God's <HI>&s;overeign</HI> grace. Such are election, the gift of Chri&s;t, the revelation of the go&s;pel; and the gift of the Holy Spirit in its internal influences, and all the means of grace, and the production of regeneration, conviction, repentance, faith and love in the &s;oul; the&s;e are all <HI>unconditional</HI> favours; and be&s;towed on &s;inners in the exerci&s;e of <HI>&s;overeign</HI> grace, without re&s;pect to any <HI>moral</HI> qualification in them, as <HI>de&s;erving</HI> the&s;e favours. But when the &s;inner by believing in Chri&s;t, hath complied with the <HI>condition</HI> of the covenant of grace, to <HI>which</HI> the promi&s;e is made&mdash;pardon, ju&s;tification and eternal life, may be &s;aid to be be&s;towed in the exerci&s;e of <HI>free</HI> grace, more properly than <HI>&s;overeign</HI> grace. For the <HI>believer</HI> in Chri&s;t hath a right <HI>hum|bly</HI> to <HI>lay claim</HI> to the <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> and to plead the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>faith|fulne&s;s</HI> of God, for the fulfilment of it. See 1 John i. 9. "If we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t</HI> to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s," i. e. If with penitent <HI>be|lieving</HI> hearts we confe&s;s our &s;ins, God hath obliged him&s;elf in cove|nant to pardon, ju&s;tify, &s;anctify and &s;ave us.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> We may learn how the &s;ub&s;titution of the Son of God, and his vicarious &s;ufferings, and the imputation of his merit or righteou&s;ne&s;s to penitent, believing &s;inners, for their pardon, ju&s;ti|fication and eternal &s;alvation are con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. Had God the Father, with his Son's con&s;ent &s;ub&s;tituted him to bear the <HI>individual penalty</HI> or puni&s;hment threatened to the &s;inner, in the <HI>moral law,</HI> and had the Father <HI>inflicted</HI> this penalty on his Son with his own hand, I do not &s;ee how this would have been con&s;i&s;t|ent with rea&s;on or ju&s;tice, or an&s;wered any ends in making atone|ment or &s;atisfaction. I do not &s;ee how it could be any <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> to an infinitely <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> God to inflict any &s;ufferings on his <HI>innocent, holy</HI> and infinitely <HI>glorious Son,</HI> with his own hard or im|mediate command. And indeed for God to <HI>reproach</HI> the <HI>divine character</HI> of his Son as the Heir of the kingdom, would have been as impo&s;&s;ible as for God to deny him&s;elf. And if God had crucified his Son, how could &s;inners he told with truth <HI>or</HI> propriety, "Ye have taken and with wicked hands have crucified and &s;lain the Prince of life? <HI>repent</HI> therefore," &amp;c. As in acts ii. 37. And
<PB N="41" REF="020704_0040_0FB0A66A6DA89940">
how would his being made a &s;acrifice for &s;in, have condemned &s;in, in devils and wicked men; as pregnant with <HI>mortal</HI> enmity to God's character and kingdom? And how did he endure the contradiction of &s;inners again&s;t him&s;elf?</P>
<P>But con&s;ider God the Son as being under the <HI>covenant of redemp|tion,</HI> as di&s;tinct from the <HI>moral law,</HI> and being <HI>&s;ub&s;tituted</HI> by the Father and his own con&s;ent to become a &s;ervant, to do and &s;uffer what &s;hould fulfil the <HI>conditions</HI> of that covenant, and an&s;wer <HI>its requirements,</HI> in deciding this war; and here we &s;hall &s;ee the agen|cy of God the Father&mdash;the agency of God the Son&mdash;and the <HI>di&s;|tinct</HI> agency of the <HI>enemies</HI> of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, in their pro|per light and importance. In this affair God the Father expre&s;&s;es his <HI>infinite benevolence</HI> in delivering up his only begotten, <HI>i. e.</HI> co-e&s;&s;ential, infinitely dear, tran&s;cendently glorious, and divinely ex|cellent Son from his bo&s;om, and &s;etting him forth to be a propitia|tion for &s;in. God the Son di&s;plays his <HI>infinite grace</HI> and <HI>love</HI> in <HI>of|fering</HI> up him&s;elf, to become a victim and &s;acrifice, in the devil's kingdom. The enemies of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s manife&s;t their <HI>mortal enmity</HI> to God's character, as moral Governour, and the intere&s;t of his kingdom, and the <HI>infinite evil</HI> of &s;in, in its nature and tendency, in conquering and &s;acrificing the Son of God, and depriving him of his liberty, life and <HI>divine glory,</HI> as the <HI>Heir</HI> of the kingdom. God the Father declares his <HI>inflexible ju&s;tice,</HI> in his in&s;i&s;ting on an <HI>infinite &s;atisfaction,</HI> before he pardons one &s;inner. God the Son makes this &s;atisfaction, by declaring God's righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and executing judgement on his enemies; and laying a foun|dation for the conviction and conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and the de&s;truc|tion of &s;atan's kingdom; and the increa&s;ing the <HI>moral</HI> kingdom of God in glory and felicity, to an infinite degree, by occa&s;ion of &s;in. And every one from among the children of men that believeth in Je&s;us, and receives by faith and love the atonement he hath made, may, out of re&s;pect to his merit, be pardoned, ju&s;tified, and &s;aved in the exerci&s;e of God's <HI>free</HI> and <HI>&s;overeign grace,</HI> con&s;i&s;tent with his <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> and to the honour of his character, law and government. And though the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> that Chri&s;t was made for us, was not the individual cur&s;e threatened to the &s;inner, in the <HI>moral</HI> law, nor was it inflicted on him by the hand or command of his Father, yet, con&s;idering the dignity of his per&s;on, and the greatne&s;s of his hu|miliation in &s;ubmitting to be conquered and &s;lain, in &s;uch an igno|minious manner, on the cro&s;s, and in having his <HI>divine character</HI> reproached, and his <HI>divine glory</HI> eclip&s;ed, by the in&s;ults of his own &s;inful creatures, that were enemies to truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s; the cur&s;e Chri&s;t was made, and the &s;ufferings he endured were greater than the cur&s;e threatened to the &s;inner in the <HI>moral law</HI>; and more than equivalent in &s;upporting the rights of government, and mak|ing
<PB N="42" REF="020704_0041_0FB0A66BDE6186E0">
atonement and &s;atisfaction for &s;in. For, by this means God's <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> appears <HI>inflexible</HI> and his <HI>truth inviolable,</HI> when his ju&s;tifies the &s;inner that believeth in Je&s;us. And &s;hould any enquire, How doth the infinite evil of &s;in appear, in Chri&s;t's enemies conquering and &s;laying him, &s;ince his crucifiers did it through ignorance; they did not <HI>know</HI> he was the Lord of glory&mdash;but took him to be an impo&s;ter! how then doth their enmity in putting him to death ap|pear to be aimed again&s;t his divine character as <HI>Heir</HI> of the king|dom? To this I an&s;wer, That it is probable that many that had an immediate hand in his crucifixion, did not believe him to be the true Me&s;&s;iah, and Saviour of the world; if they had they would have committed the unpardonable &s;in in crucifying him. And therefore the Apo&s;tle tells them, "Ye did it ignorantly, as did al&s;o your rulers; repent therefore," &amp;c. but though their ignorance <HI>alleviated</HI> their guilt, yet it did not <HI>excu&s;e</HI> them, becau&s;e they had &s;ufficient <HI>means</HI> of knowledge, but their <HI>love</HI> of darkne&s;&s; and wicked|ne&s;s prevented their <HI>attending</HI> to the&s;e means; and in this con&s;i&s;ted their condemnation. But though the immediate crucifers of Chri&s;t, did not know he was the true Me&s;&s;iah and Lord of glory, yet the devils knew it. "We <HI>know</HI> thee, who thou art, <HI>the holy one of God."</HI> And this is the language of the devil, as the prince of dark|ne&s;s, and god of this world; and the languege of his &s;ubjects and agents. "This is the <HI>Heir,</HI> come and let us kill him, and &s;eize on the inheritance." And all Chri&s;t's crucifers were under the influence of the <HI>error</HI> and <HI>temper</HI> of the devil. And if the <HI>&s;in</HI> of devils contains in it <HI>mortal enmity</HI> to God's character, as moral Governour, and &s;o is an <HI>infinite evil,</HI> pregnant with infinite mi&s;|chief to being in general, the <HI>&s;in</HI> of men is the <HI>&s;ame.</HI> And if the <HI>&s;in</HI> of <HI>devils</HI> is condemned by the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t as an <HI>infinite evil,</HI> and &s;o <HI>de&s;erving</HI> of an infinite or <HI>endle&s;s puni&s;hment,</HI> then the <HI>&s;in</HI> of <HI>all mankind</HI> &s;tands equally condemned; notwith&s;tanding any deficiency of &s;peculative knowledge or natural powers. And one great rea&s;on of Chri&s;t's being made a &s;acrifice for &s;in, was thus to <HI>condemn &s;in</HI> in devils, and wicked men, and &s;o de&s;troy the power of &s;atan, over the hearts of men, and <HI>de&s;troy</HI> him in a <HI>moral &s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> We may infer, from what hath been &s;aid, that the go&s;pel mu&s;t be of divine original.</P>
<P>Prophecies, and miracles afford us very &s;trong and convincing proofs of this truth, and ought to bear great weight upon the mind. The prophecies, &s;eem to be rather de&s;criptions, and hi&s;tories of pa&s;t tran&s;actions than predictions of future events; and whoever attends to them properly, mu&s;t be convinced that they are derived from &s;upernatural in&s;piration. The miracles recorded in the New Te&s;tament were certainly a convincing proof to tho&s;e that &s;aw
<PB N="43" REF="020704_0042_0FB0A66E02D54010">
them, of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles; and come as well atte&s;ted to us, as any other hi&s;torical facts: as they were &s;een of numbers, and wrought on &s;o great and wonderful an occa&s;i|on. For it is in no wi&s;e incredible, that a &s;upernatural revelation &s;hould be foretold, and inforced by &s;upernatural means. And from this book, may be collected a &s;y&s;tem of morality or eithicks, which exceeds all others for its purity and perfection; and to which the wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;ophers, of preceding ages, can make no pretentions. All its moral precepts are founded in rea&s;on&mdash;tend to improve our natures, and are conducive to the happine&s;s of mankind.&mdash;Read the decalogue&mdash;And what other religion, be&s;ides the Chri&s;tian, ever carried the moral virtues of piety to God, benevolence to men, ju&s;tice, charity, temperance and &s;obriety to &s;o high a degree of purity and perfection; and &s;o &s;everely prohibited the commi&s;&s;ion of the contrary vices, which tend to deba&s;e our natures, and by mutual injuries, introduce univer&s;al di&s;order; and con&s;equently univer&s;al mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>What other religion ever required of its votaries that humility and poorne&s;s of &s;pirit, that forgivene&s;s of injuries and charity to all men, as the be&s;t expedient to prepare them for the kingdom of heaven!&mdash;Read our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's &s;ermon on the mount, and hear him &s;ay, "Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&mdash;Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy: But I &s;ay unto you, Love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you." A new commandment give I unto you (&s;aith our ble&s;&s;ed Lord) that ye love one another, as I have loved you, by this &s;hall all men know, that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another." And did he not &s;peak as never man &s;pake? And read the Apo&s;tle Paul's admirable de&s;cription of charity; "Charity &s;uffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not; cha|rity vaunteth not it&s;elf; is not puffed up; doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly; &s;eeketh not her own, is not ea&s;ily provoked; thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; bear|eth all things; hopeth all things; endureth all things.</P>
<P>But the prophecies and miracles contained in the &s;criptures, and the excellency and purity of the morals therein pre&s;cribed, though they are very weighty and good arguments, and demand our mo&s;t &s;erious attention and admiration, yet they are by no means the <HI>on|ly,</HI> or even the <HI>principal</HI> proofs of their divine origin. But, the principal and mo&s;t conclu&s;ive evidences of the divine origin of the go&s;pel, are the doctrines peculiar to divine revelation; &s;uch as the trinity of per&s;ons or agents in the divine e&s;&s;ence&mdash;the apo&s;tacy of angels and man. The grand conte&s;t that commenced upon this
<PB N="44" REF="020704_0043_0FB0A6705F42C6F0">
apo&s;tacy between heaven and hell, concerning the truth and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God's character as moral Governour, and how this con|controver&s;y hath been carried on from age to age; and how it was decided by God the Son upon the cro&s;s; and his re&s;urrection from the dead; the appointment of the eternal <HI>Logos</HI> to engage in this controver&s;y, when it was impo&s;&s;ible for any other to decide it. The covenant of redemption, into which he entered with the Fa|ther, and the terms of that covenant. The incarnation of the Son of God, his amazing humiliation, arduous &s;ervices and great &s;uf|ferings; when he was made a victim and &s;acrifice in the devils kingdom; by which means he declared the truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God's character as moral Governour, and &s;o made atonement, and paid the price of man's redemption, and opened a way for God to ju&s;tify him that believeth in Je&s;us, con&s;i&s;tent with his ju&s;tice; and by the &s;ame means layed a foundation for the convic|tion and conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and to condemn &s;in as an infinite evil, pregnant with infinite mi&s;chief to God's character and go|vernment&mdash;and de&s;troy &s;atan in a <HI>moral &s;en&s;e,</HI> and finally ruin his kingdom and dominion over the hearts of men, and prepare the way for the manife&s;tation of the righteous judgment of God at the la&s;t great day. And all that is required of &s;inners in order to their being intere&s;ted in all the precious benefits of his purcha&s;e is com|prehended in <HI>faith,</HI> which is a &s;elf emptying, Chri&s;t magnifying and God exalting grace: which <HI>brings</HI> nothing but <HI>receives</HI> all of <HI>free</HI> and <HI>&s;overeign grace.</HI> In exerci&s;e of faith in the Mediator, the &s;inner gives up all created wi&s;dom, and depends only upon divine revelation for direction. Gives up all righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own; and depends on the merit of Chri&s;t for righteou&s;ne&s;s and life, grace and glory. Gives up &s;elf government, and depends on Chri&s;t to rule in and reign over him, and expects to overcome his enemies only by the blood of the Lamb, and the te&s;timony he holds.&mdash; Now the&s;e are things that no created benevolence could ever conceive, no created wi&s;dom ever devi&s;e, or created power accompli&s;h; and do as fully prove the divine origin of the holy &s;cripture, as the marks of infinite wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s manife&s;ted in the works of creation, do that this world is of divine original; and could not be planned or made by any creature: becau&s;e no created wi&s;dom or power is equal to &s;uch a production.</P>
<P>The devil never invented this plan of &s;alvation; for it is &s;ub|ver&s;ive of his kingdom and intere&s;t. It is incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of any good creature to put &s;uch a cheat upon mankind (if he was able) as to attribute that to God, of which he him&s;elf was the author. But no created being was able to lay out &s;uch a plan, thus to di&s;play the perfections of God by the occa&s;ion of &s;in; and even render them more illu&s;trious, than if &s;in had never enter|tered
<PB N="45" REF="020704_0044_0FB0A6753A228D98">
into his kingdom; and thus to bring the greate&s;t good out of the greate&s;t evil! bring righteou&s;ne&s;s out of &s;in, and life out of death! to conquer by being conquered, and &s;lay his enemies by being &s;lain by them! and by being &s;acrificed, to enter into his king|dom! at one and the &s;ame time to appear as a lamb, and a lion! a victim and a conqueror!</P>
<P>This plan of &s;alvation hath never been corrupted; if it had, it never could have been rectified, and appear as it now doth, in its divine glory and perfection! Let any <HI>rational</HI> infidel read and <HI>un|der&s;tand</HI> the go&s;pel, and he will be obliged to confe&s;s, that not one doctrine it contains is repugnant to rea&s;on, but the whole is harmo|nious and con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>Infidels impute the mi&s;taken notions of fallible men, and their corrupt explanations of the &s;criptures, to the &s;criptures them&s;elves; and then villify and reproach the &s;criptures, as containing &s;uch un|rea&s;onable doctrines; which is very unfair: It would be much more rational, if they would fir&s;t <HI>&s;tudy</HI> the &s;criptures, and well <HI>under&s;tand</HI> them, and the doctrines they contain, before they reject and villify them.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Let all be exhorted and prevailed upon to receive the a|tonement, and be reconciled to God immediately. God the Fa|ther hath manife&s;ted his infinite benevolence to &s;inners, and his willingne&s;s to be reconciled to them, and hath opened a way for reconciliation, con&s;i&s;tent with his righteou&s;ne&s;s, by &s;ending his Son to die.</P>
<P>The Son hath di&s;covered his infinite love and grace to &s;inners, and his intere&s;t in the court of heaven, by making a complete atone|ment and &s;atisfaction; &s;o that the honour of his Father's law and government may be &s;upported, and advanced, in the &s;alvation of all that will receive the atonement. God the Father hath already received the atonement, and &s;et to his &s;eal, that he hath approved all that his Son hath done and &s;uffered, as our Mediator and Surety. He hath rai&s;ed him from the dead, and declared with a voice from heaven, that Chri&s;t is his beloved Son in whom he is well plea&s;ed; and commanded all to <HI>hear</HI> him and believe in him.</P>
<P>And all that remains to compleat the union is, that you give your hearts to Chri&s;t, and cordially receive Him as your Mediator, re|nouncing all merit or righteou&s;ne&s;s in your&s;elf, and owning the &s;en|tence of the law ju&s;t, and relinqui&s;h the kingdom of &s;atan, and be|come Chri&s;t's friend, and lay hold on his covenant; and all that he hath done and &s;uffered &s;hall be made over to you for your everla&s;t|ing advantage. The&s;e benefits co&s;t the Father dear, and the Son dear; but they will co&s;t you nothing: you may <HI>freely receive</HI> them, and they will become yours without money and without price: they are as free and unmeritted as to you, as if no atonement had been made: God requires no good de&s;ert in you, previous to your re|ceiving his Son.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="020704_0045_0FB0A67667110D88">And will you not heartily approve, and fall in with this way of &s;alvation, which God in infinite love and wi&s;dom hath provided for &s;inners? Will you not give your hearts to Chri&s;t, and declare him to be your beloved Saviour, in whom you are well plea&s;ed? Do not all created and uncreated glories center in him? If you reject the atonement, do you think you can devi&s;e &s;ome wi&s;er, ea&s;ier and bet|ter way of &s;alvation than this? or that any other prince or &s;aviour hath a better claim to your hearts?</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> We learn how impo&s;&s;ible it is, that he who neglects this &s;alvation, and finally rejects Chri&s;t Je&s;u&s;, &s;hould e&s;cape the eternal wrath and vengeance of God. It is incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> of God, as moral Governor of the univer&s;e, that any &s;uch &s;hould e&s;cape. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of God (as we have ob&s;erved) con&s;i&s;ts in his <HI>benevolence, ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>truth</HI>; and &s;hould he violate either of the&s;e he would cea&s;e to be righteous; and his government mu&s;t fall into contempt among his &s;ubjects, and tend to annihilation. And this would introduce confu&s;ion and ruin into his moral kingdom. And if God &s;hould pardon one &s;in till adequate &s;atisfaction be fir&s;t made, he mu&s;t violate his righteou&s;ne&s;s; for he hath threatened death to every &s;in: "The &s;oul that &s;ins &s;hall die;" and his <HI>truth</HI> &s;tands engaged for the execution of this threatening; and his truth mu&s;t appear <HI>inviolable</HI>: and his ju&s;tice, as well as his truth, de|mands that this threatening be executed; and this mu&s;t appear <HI>in|flexible</HI>; for &s;in, as it is committed again&s;t God, and is pregnant with <HI>mortal</HI> enmity to his character, as moral Governor, and tends to dethrone him and ruin his kingdom, de&s;erves an infinite or end|le&s;s puni&s;hment; and to remit this penalty in one in&s;tance of di&s;o|bedience, is incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>inflexible ju&s;tice.</HI> And <HI>infinite bene|volence</HI> to his moral kingdom, and the be&s;t good of all the moral &s;ubjects of it, demands that the rights of moral government be &s;up|ported: for the whole of the peace and happine&s;s of a kingdom de|pends upon the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the character, law and government of the Supreme Ruler. He mu&s;t appear the &s;ame in execution that he is in legi&s;lation, or his government will fall into contempt a|mong his &s;ubject. And it was this that rendered an infinite atone|ment or &s;atisfaction nece&s;&s;ary, in order to open a way for God to exerci&s;e his mercy to &s;inners, con&s;i&s;tently with his ju&s;tice. Had not God &s;et forth his Son to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s, he could not have ju&s;tified one &s;inner con&s;i&s;tently with his ju&s;tice. But &s;ince Chri&s;t hath taken our law place, &s;o as to make &s;atisfaction for our &s;ins, God can ju&s;tify the greate&s;t &s;inner that by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>receives</HI> the atone|ment which he hath made, as con&s;i&s;tently as he can the mo&s;t holy an|gel in heaven. And God's in&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch an infinite &s;atisfaction being made, and the &s;inner's being intere&s;ted in it, before he par|dons him, declares that &s;in is an infinite evil in God's e&s;teem; and
<PB N="47" REF="020704_0046_0FB0A67872C9CCF0">
that every &s;inner that is not intere&s;ted by faith, in the &s;atisfaction which his Son hath made, mu&s;t &s;uffer an infinite or endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment: for there is no way far the truth and ju&s;tice of God in the threatening to be vindicated, and the rights of government to be &s;upported, but one of the&s;e two&mdash;an infinite &s;atisfaction, or an end|le&s;s puni&s;hment. And there was no being in the univer&s;e that could make this infinite &s;atisfaction but God the Son; and it co&s;t him his liberty, life and divine glory; which was an infinite &s;acrifice. And this was the only remedy. And the &s;inner can receive no be|nefit from the infinite &s;atisfaction Chri&s;t hath made, any way but by being united to him, and one with him in a covenant relation. The rights of government mu&s;t be &s;upported by inflicting on all o|thers a puni&s;hment adequate to their crime. There is no other name or way in which we can be &s;aved but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and if we neglect this way, and reject this Saviour, there remaineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;in. And in neglecting this way, we offer the greate&s;t affront to God, who hath in infinite mercy provided this Saviour for us!&mdash;What a &s;trange puni&s;hment, then, will be inflict|ed on them who de&s;pi&s;e and reject God's own eternal Son; turn a deaf ear to his go&s;pel, and &s;tifle and grieve his &s;pirit! Verily, though he that believeth on him is not condemned, yet he that be|lieveth not is condemned already, becau&s;e he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. Unbelief, or rejecting Chri&s;t, is the formal cau&s;e of the &s;inner's damnation: It is that &s;in which binds the guilt of all his other &s;ins upon him, and con&s;igns him over to damnation. This &s;in not only procures damnation, but no damnation like it. Wherefore we may ju&s;tly conclude, that who&s;oever finally neglects or rejects Chri&s;t and the common &s;alvation purcha&s;ed and offered by him to &s;inners, &s;hall in no wi&s;e e&s;cape the eternal wrath and vengeance of God.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Let all unregenerate, chri&s;tle&s;s &s;inners, be exhorted, di|rected and prevailed upon, to attend to the go&s;pel, and hear and under&s;tand the &s;aving truths therein contained, and receive them by faith and love, as the only means of being made partakers of this &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to &s;et before you, your own true character, as you are &s;inners in &s;atan's kingdom and intere&s;t, in a &s;tate of en|mity and rebellion to God, ju&s;tly condemned to eternal mi&s;ery; helple&s;s and hopele&s;s in your&s;elves; de&s;titute of all righteou&s;ne&s;s: dead in law, and &s;piritually dead; and entirely in the hands of a &s;overeign God.</P>
<P>I have repre&s;ented to you the character of God, as he is infinite in his benevolence, and yet inflexible in his ju&s;tice, and his truth is inviolable; and he will in no wi&s;e clear the guilty. And I have prohibited to you the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as he is the true Me&s;&s;iah and the only Saviour of the world. And I have opened un|to
<PB N="48" REF="020704_0047_0FB0A67963239EE8">
you the only method by which you can be &s;aved; the only me|thod that can afford the lea&s;t gleam of hope to a convinced peri&s;h|ing &s;inner. And this &s;alvation is brought to your very door by di|vine revelation; and put in the power of every &s;inner that lives un|der the light of the go&s;pel, and hath capacity and opportunity to hear and under&s;tand the truths therein contained. God the Father hath devi&s;ed this method of &s;alvation; God the Son hath purcha&s;ed it; and God the Spirit hath revealed it: and the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t exhibit and explain it to you. But neither God the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit, or the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, can <HI>receive</HI> it for you. This mu&s;t be your own act, as free and di&s;tinct moral agents. And it is the wi&s;e&s;t, the ea&s;ie&s;t and be&s;t method, for the &s;alvation of a &s;inner, that can be devi&s;ed or de&s;ired. And if you under&s;tand, and cordially fall in with this method, you may be &s;aved in a way that will bring honour to God's character, law and government.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, How can we be entitled to this &s;alvation, &s;ince we have no righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own, and are dead in law? To this I an&s;wer, That the righteou&s;ne&s;&s; of Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify you in the &s;ight of God, and free you from condemnation, and entitle you to this &s;alvation. And you mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t and receive his righteou&s;ne&s;s by tru&s;ting in his merit alone by faith. But you will &s;ay, How can we come to Chri&s;t, and by faith receive his righteou&s;ne&s;s? You tell us we are <HI>&s;piritually</HI> dead, and have no <HI>pow|er</HI> to change our hearts. And our Saviour tells us&mdash;"No man can come to me except the Father which &s;ent me draw him."&mdash;To this I an&s;wer, That though you are &s;piritually dead, and have no power to change your hearts; and you cannot come to Chri&s;t un|le&s;s drawn by the Father; yet the &s;pirit of God is able to commu|nicate &s;piritual life to your &s;ouls. And the Father is able to draw you to Chri&s;t, by his word and &s;pirit of truth. And what you have to do is to receive this word and &s;pirit of truth, by hearing and learning of the Father, by attending to the truths of divine revela|tion. We have no need to make u&s;e of any metaphy&s;ical di&s;tinction between <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> power, in order to under&s;tand our Sa|viour's meaning here, or to fa&s;ten blame upon the &s;inner that is not drawn by the Father, and &s;o cannot come to Chri&s;t. The blame of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, is their not attending to divine reve|lation, and to the in&s;tructions of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and being <HI>taught</HI> of God; or <HI>hearing</HI> and <HI>learning</HI> of the Father: their inor|dinate love of worldly honour, and &s;trong prejudices in favour of error, and conceit of their own knowledge and righteou&s;ne&s;s, kept them in <HI>ignorance</HI> of the truth of their own character, the character of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the character of Chri&s;t and the way of &s;alvation by him. And it was impo&s;&s;ible this ignorance, error and prejudice &s;hould be removed, and they brought to receive the truth in the love of it, and give up their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and
<PB N="49" REF="020704_0048_0FB0A67B01D91178">
depend upon the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t alone for &s;alvation, 'till they could be prevailed upon to hear and learn the go&s;pel, and under|&s;tand the truths of it. <HI>They erred, not knowing the &s;criptures</HI>: and it was not becau&s;e God withheld any <HI>internal influences,</HI> or was wanting as to the means of in&s;truction; but it was becau&s;e they would not hear and learn the go&s;pel, and receive the &s;pirit in its vital influences, by obtaining the <HI>knowledge</HI> of the truth. Had they <HI>heard</HI> and <HI>learned</HI> of the Father, they would have received the &s;pirit of truth; and the knowledge and &s;pirit of truth could &s;oon have removed their ignorance, corrected their errors, humbled their pride, mortified their &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit, changed their hearts, and drawn them to receive his truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and eternal life, through faith in his name. But they peri&s;hed for <HI>lack of know|ledge,</HI> becau&s;e they would not hear and learn of God the Father&mdash; See John vi. 44.45.</P>
<P>It is the excellency of the holy &s;criptures, above all other wri|tings, that they contain and reveal to us the <HI>knowledge</HI> of this &s;al|vation: and it is the excellency of the go&s;pel that it is the <HI>mini&s;tra|tion</HI> of the &s;pirit to &s;inners, in its vital influences, by means of this <HI>knowledge.</HI> And it is this that cau&s;es the power of divine truth to be &s;o omnipotent, when it takes hold of the mind. <HI>The words of Chri&s;t are &s;pirit</HI> and <HI>life.</HI> And when divine truth enters the mind, how &s;oon are the clouds of ignorance, darkne&s;s and error di&s;pelled from the under&s;tanding? What divine light doth it diffu&s;e through the &s;oul? It gives life to the dead, and calls dead &s;inners from their tombs; and gives light to the blind. This divine truth converts the &s;oul&mdash;makes wi&s;e the &s;imple&mdash;rejoices the heart&mdash;enlightens the eyes, and endures forever. By receiving the knowledge of di|vine truth, the poor will find gold tried in the fire, to enrich them! The naked will find white raiment to clothe them! And the blind find eye &s;alve to re&s;tore their &s;ight! The truths of the go&s;pel are a fea&s;t provided by infinite wi&s;dom for hungry, peri&s;hing &s;ouls: and they are offered to all; and if &s;inners obtain the <HI>knowledge</HI> of them, they may expect that the &s;pirit of truth will accompany them, and by his powerful influences, remove the corruption of the principle of the heart. Regeneration is produced in the <HI>principle</HI> of the &s;oul, by an <HI>immediate, in&s;tantaneous, irre&s;i&s;tible</HI> operation of the &s;pirit of God: but to obtain this knowledge, is a work of time and pain<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">: and all &s;uch as arrive to a high degree of perfection in this know|ledge, free from errors and prejudices, before regeneration, will be full grown chri&s;tians, and able al&s;o to teach others, upon their fir&s;t receiving this &s;aving change by the &s;pirit of God. But &s;uch as have been regenerated forty years, but have made but &s;mall at|tainments in this orthodox knowledge of the &s;criptures, will be but <HI>babes</HI> in Chri&s;t, and <HI>novices</HI> in religion. "And when for the time they ought to have been teachers, they have need that one teach
<PB N="50" REF="020704_0049_0FB0A67CAF119750">
them again, which be the fir&s;t principles of the oracles of God; and are become &s;uch as have need of milk and not of &s;trong meat." See Heb. v. 12. But let their attainments in knowledge, before regeneration, be ever &s;o high, unle&s;s they attain that <HI>pure</HI> know|ledge or under&s;tanding of the truths of the go&s;pel, which is e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation, all their attainments in knowledge will but &s;erve to increa&s;e and aggravate their damnation. And they will not be able to excu&s;e them&s;elves by &s;aying, that God withheld from them tho&s;e influences of his &s;pirit that were needful to change their hearts. For unle&s;s they fir&s;t obtain this knowledge them&s;elves, by attend|ing to the go&s;pel, they have no rea&s;on to expect the &s;pirit will ever change their heart. But the blame will lie at their own door for neglecting the&s;e means and opportunities. And never think you have obtained this knowledge 'till you find a love to the truth pro|duced in your hearts. And none may expect to receive the &s;pirit in its vital influences, and a love to the truth, but tho&s;e who fir&s;t obtain this <HI>knowledge,</HI> in the exerci&s;e of their <HI>natural</HI> principles and powers. And this is called <HI>divine</HI> knowledge, as it is obtained only from the light of <HI>divine</HI> revelation, and not from the light of nature, by <HI>human</HI> rea&s;on. The moral law, and the light of nature, are a <HI>mini&s;tration</HI> of death and condemnation; but the go&s;pel is a <HI>mini&s;tration</HI> of the &s;pirit of life and of <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>&mdash;See 2 Cor. iii. And this cau&s;es the go&s;pel to exceed all other di&s;pen&s;ations in glory. And it is by <HI>hearing</HI> the go&s;pel, &s;o as to obtain the <HI>knowledge</HI> of it, that the holy &s;pirit of life is <HI>received</HI> by &s;inners&mdash;See Gal. iii. 2. And faith comes by hearing the word of God&mdash;Rom. x. 17. And all &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings are communicated to &s;inners through the <HI>know|ledge</HI> of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Through this know|ledge &s;inners receive the holy &s;pirit, in its regenerating influences, and &s;o are made partakers of a divine nature, and e&s;cape the cor|ruption of the world&mdash;See 2 Pet. i. 2.3.4.</P>
<P>After &s;inners have obtained this knowledge of the truth, and &s;o have received the &s;pirit of truth, in its vital influences, and are regenerated by the &s;pirit, they have the love of the truth; and this is called <HI>&s;piritual</HI> knowledge, as it is produced in <HI>principle, imme|diately</HI> by the &s;pirit of God, in what is called <HI>pa&s;&s;ive regeneration,</HI> and it is a <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of <HI>heart,</HI> or <HI>perception</HI> of the <HI>&s;piritual beauty</HI> and <HI>ex|cellency</HI> of divine objects, that are formed fir&s;t in the under&s;tanding. But that knowledge, of which I am now &s;peaking, is very differ|ent from this <HI>&s;piritual</HI> knowledge: and it is called <HI>&s;peculative</HI> or <HI>doctrinal</HI> knowledge: and is not produced in the &s;oul by the holy &s;pirit in regeneration, as &s;piritual knowledge is; but by objective light let into the under&s;tanding, and it may be produced before the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> is <HI>received</HI>; but <HI>&s;piritual</HI> knowledge cannot. And it is this <HI>&s;peculative,</HI> divine knowledge of the &s;aving truths contained in di|vine revelation, that the P&s;almi&s;t e&s;teemed above gold, yea above
<PB N="51" REF="020704_0050_0FB0A67E35204BC8">
much fine gold. And the wi&s;e man commends &s;o highly, in his writings under the name of <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> and exhorts &s;inners to &s;eek to obtain, with the greate&s;t vigour and per&s;everance. This is that knowledge which the Apo&s;tle Paul prefers to all the wi&s;dom of this world, and all the knowledge of the learned Grecian and Heathen princes and philo&s;ophers. This is not the knowledge which man's wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the holy gho&s;t teacheth, not in regeneration, but in divine revelation.</P>
<P>This knowledge is called <HI>life eternal,</HI> by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. And wherever this &s;peculative divine knowledge is received into the &s;oul, by &s;aith and love, eternal life is already begun in that &s;oul. And for the neglect of the means of obtaining this know|ledge, God had a controver&s;y with his people; and for lack of this knowledge his people were de&s;troyed; and for rejecting it, God rejected his prie&s;ts, See Ho&s;. iv. This was all <HI>&s;peculative</HI> know|ledge of the &s;criptures, for the&s;e things could not be predicated of <HI>&s;piritual</HI> knowledge or <HI>love</HI> of the truth. And though this know|ledge and conviction of <HI>revealed</HI> truths, by means of which the &s;pi|rit is at fir&s;t received in its vital influences, is not in it&s;elf &s;aving to the &s;inner that obtains it, 'till embraced by faith and love; but may be rejected by enmity and unbelief, and &s;o increa&s;e his dam|nation: yet it is e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence, exerci&s;e, and increa&s;e of every &s;aving grace and virtue. There can be no &s;aving con|viction, repentance, faith, love or &s;piritual knowledge, or well grounded hope, or joy, or happine&s;s in time, or in eternity with|out it. Without it, &s;inners cannot move one &s;tep towards heaven; nor can &s;aints grow in grace, or increa&s;e in happine&s;s any fa&s;ter than they grow in this knowledge.</P>
<P>And all who have capacities, means and opportunities, may ob|tain this <HI>divine</HI> knowledge before they receive the &s;pirit in its re|generating influences, or have any <HI>&s;aving</HI> change of heart, if they will but only apply their minds to the &s;tudy of the go&s;pel, as of any other book, and make u&s;e of tho&s;e means and advantages for in&s;truc|tion, that all may enjoy, who live in a land of go&s;pel light. And it needs no very great capacities or great degrees of learning and know|ledge, in other things, in order to obtain this &s;aving knowledge, if the mind be but free from error and prejudice. Not many wi&s;e men after <HI>the fle&s;h</HI> obtained this hnowledge, in the days of our Sa|viour and his apo&s;tles; becau&s;e they were &s;o conceited of their own knowledge and goodne&s;s, and prejudiced in favour of error, that they would not attend to divine in&s;truction. But babes and &s;uck|lings and publicans and harlots and Peter's bearers, many of whom, it is probable, could not read a word, and had but &s;mall na|tural capacities, but free from prejudicies and errors, could obtain it in a &s;hort time, by attending in earne&s;t to the means of in&s;truction. And by obtaining this knowledge, they received the &s;pirit, and
<PB N="52" REF="020704_0051_0FB0A6827410EB20">
were regenerated and converted by his preaching. And the fir&s;t &s;tep that you mu&s;t take, in order to your being made partakers of this &s;alvation, is, to obtain this <HI>&s;peculative</HI> knowledge of the truths contained in divine revelation. This is the <HI>key,</HI> by means of which, &s;inners enter into the kingdom of Chri&s;t; and till this is obtained, no &s;inner can enter the <HI>&s;trait gate</HI>; or go one &s;tep to|wards heaven, or ever &s;ee, receive or enjoy any of the benefits of the go&s;pel. But &s;uch as obtain this knowledge, are not far from the kingdom of God, but are lifted up to heaven, though they may be ca&s;t down to hell at la&s;t, for not receiving it with faith and love. But none may expect to receive the &s;pirit of truth, or any &s;aving change of heart by the influences of the &s;pirit, or to receive the truth with faith and love, 'till they fir&s;t obtain this &s;peculative knowledge of the truth. And therefore, when God de&s;igns to communicate his &s;pirit, in its vital influences, he fir&s;t &s;ends the means of this knowledge to that people, by the di&s;pen&s;ers of the go&s;pel; and in this way, he is often found of them that &s;ought him not, and made manife&s;t to them that a&s;ked not after him.</P>
<P>As in Ezekiel's vi&s;ion, "whither the &s;pirit was to go, there the living creatures went." The&s;e living creatures are the di&s;pen&s;ers of the go&s;pel; and the&s;e always go before the &s;pirit of truth; that they may communicate the truth, and make manife&s;t the &s;avour of the <HI>knowledge</HI> of Chri&s;t, in every place. And where the teachers are e&s;&s;entially ignorant or erroneous in their in&s;tructions, they take away the <HI>key</HI> of knowledge from the people that depend upon their in&s;tructions. And they enter not into the kingdom of heaven them|&s;elves, and tho&s;e that are entering they hinder. And if &s;inners will neglect to <HI>hear</HI> and <HI>read</HI> and attend to the go&s;pel, where it is di&s;pen&s;ed in the power and purity of it, but will read corrupt books, and having itching ears, will run after ignorant, enthu&s;ia&s;tic erro|neous, corrupt teachers, they mu&s;t peri&s;h for lack of &s;aving know|ledge, however learned and knowing they may be, in other things. "For, if the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the ditch." And though many may e&s;teem this knowledge of &s;alvation by the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, <HI>unintelligible</HI> or <HI>my&s;terious</HI> fooli&s;hne&s;s, and &s;o may peri&s;h in their &s;in, rather than attend to it, and &s;eek to under&s;tand it; yet, it plea&s;es God by the preaching of this <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> to &s;ave them that believe. And it is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to exhort, and &s;tir up unregenerate, chri&s;tle&s;s &s;inners, to at|tend and &s;eek with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s and per&s;everance, to ob|tain this knowledge in the fir&s;t place. Mini&s;ters cannot produce re|generation, love of the truth, repentance, faith or any grace in the hearts of &s;inners, by their in&s;tructions or exhortations; this is the <HI>&s;ole</HI> work of the &s;pirit: but mini&s;ters can communicate this know|ledge, and &s;tir up &s;inners to obtain it. &mdash; But you will &s;ay, are not all the&s;e exerci&s;es and endeavours of the unregenerate, chri&s;tle&s;s
<PB N="53" REF="020704_0052_0FB0A683E22ED2F0">
&s;inner in obtaining this knowledge &s;in? And does God require any &s;uch exerci&s;es and endeavours? To the&s;e objections I an&s;wer, that the&s;e exerci&s;es are not &s;in, in them&s;elves con&s;idered. The &s;in of the unregenerate doth not con&s;i&s;t at all, in their attending on means; hearing, and &s;eeking, and praying, and crying for mercy, and deliverance from hell, <HI>only</HI> from <HI>natural</HI> principles. Their &s;in doth not con&s;i&s;t at all in the <HI>light</HI> or <HI>knowledge</HI> of the truth, which they obtain, before regeneration, but only in that enmity and unbelief which attends the&s;e exerci&s;es and endeavours; the &s;trength of which increa&s;es, as their light and knowledge of the truth increa&s;es. And more &s;in may attend the exerci&s;es of re|pentance, faith and love, in true believers, than attends the hear|ing, praying and &s;eeking of the unregenerate; &s;o that when we exhort unregenerate &s;inners to exert the&s;e exerci&s;es and endeavours, while they have a wicked heart, we no more exhort them to &s;in, than we exhort them to &s;in, when we exhort them to repent and be|lieve, &amp;c. when we know that great enmity of heart to God, and aggravated &s;ins will attend the&s;e exerci&s;es. And it is no more <HI>for,</HI> or <HI>on account</HI> of the <HI>moral goodne&s;s</HI> that there is in faith, that the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is imputed to the believer; than it is <HI>for,</HI> or <HI>on account</HI> of the moral goodne&s;s that there is in the hearing, praying, and &s;eekings of the unregenerate, that the holy &s;pirit is communicated to them. And God can as con&s;i&s;tently communi|cate the holy &s;pirit, in its vital influences, to the unregenerate &s;in|ner, in con&s;equence of his obtaining this orthodox knowledge of divine truth, and crying for mercy, as he can impute the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to the believer, in con&s;equence of his faith in Chri&s;t. In P&s;al. cvii. 6.13.19.28. we have in&s;tances of re|markable temporal deliverances granted to &s;inners <HI>in con&s;equences</HI> of their prayers and cries to God for mercy, when it doth not ap|pear that their cries or prayers, proceeded from love or friend&s;hip to God; but purely from their &s;en&s;e of their own danger, and con|viction that there was no help for them but in God alone. And though this is act a <HI>moral,</HI> yet it is a <HI>natural preparation</HI> in &s;inners to receive mercy from God.</P>
<P>And God doth require the&s;e exerci&s;es and endeavours of the un|regenerate. For this orthodox knowledge is as e&s;&s;ential to &s;aving repentance and faith as love is. And therefore, when God requires repentance and faith, he nece&s;&s;arily requires this knowledge, and every exerci&s;e and endeavour of obtaining it; and every thing that is e&s;&s;ential to the&s;e graces, as much as he doth love, or the exerci&s;es of the graces them&s;elves. God never required a &s;inner to repent and believe without this knowledge, for this would be a <HI>natural</HI> impo&s;&s;ibility. And the &s;oul cannot be good without know|ledge, or have any holy exerci&s;es. And for any to &s;ay, they exhort
<PB N="54" REF="020704_0053_0FB0A685CEC324F0">
&s;inners to repent and believe, but they do not exhort them fir&s;t to obtain that knowledge which is e&s;&s;ential to repentance and faith, is a &s;oleci&s;m in &s;peech. And moreover, God expre&s;ly commands &s;inners to exert tho&s;e exerci&s;es and endeavours, which they may exert before regeneration; and which they mu&s;t exert in order to obtain this knowledge, before they can receive the &s;pirit of truth, or have any &s;aving change. God calls upon the whole world to hear his word, Jer. xxii. 29. "Oh! earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord."&mdash;And he expre&s;ly commands the wor&s;t of &s;inners to <HI>hearken</HI> to him without any mention of their previou&s;ly having a good heart. See I&s;a. xlvi. 2. "Hearken un|to me, ye &s;tout hearted &s;inners that are far from righteou&s;ne&s;s." And our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour exhorts the &s;elf-righteous Phari&s;ees to <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures,</HI> in order to find eternal life. And numerous texts might be quoted, in which &s;uch exerci&s;es are required, and en|joined by God him&s;elf, as unregenerate &s;inners may perform with|out doing any <HI>duty acceptable</HI> to God. And &s;inners are condemn|ed, and deprived of great favours, for not exerting &s;uch exerci&s;es and endeavours. But we cannot find one in&s;tance in the go&s;pel where God forbids the&s;e exerci&s;es, and commands &s;inners, fir&s;t to obtain a good heart, to love him, and a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own, or any morally good qualification, before they <HI>hear</HI> and <HI>under|&s;tand</HI> the go&s;pel&mdash;and &s;eek and pray and cry for mercy. But &s;in|ners are expre&s;&s;ly exhorted to come to this fountain of knowledge and grace, without money and without price. Sinners &s;hould come empty handed, deeply &s;en&s;ible that they have no righteou&s;ne&s;s, no good heart, no <HI>moral</HI> qualification to bring with them; and utterly unable to change their own heart, or exerci&s;e love, or any grace: &s;en&s;ible that they are wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked; and cry unclean, unclean&mdash; God be merciful to me a <HI>&s;inner!</HI> They mu&s;t come to <HI>receive</HI> that which is <HI>freely given,</HI> and not to <HI>earn</HI> or <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> it with their <HI>good</HI> heart or <HI>good</HI> works. To &s;ay, <HI>I do not exhort you to come to hear the word, unle&s;s you come with a good heart,</HI> is <HI>legal</HI> preaching; and exceeding dangerous to the &s;ouls of &s;inners: and tends to di&s;courage the u&s;e of means, and tends to bani&s;h the <HI>knowledge of the go&s;pel,</HI> and all true religion out of the world.</P>
<P>Supreme love to God, and perfect &s;inle&s;s obedience to his will, were required in the covenant of works, as <HI>duties,</HI> and the condi|tion of eternal life. But hearing and obtaining the knowledge of of the go&s;pel, conviction and repentance of &s;in, and faith in the Mediator, or love to God, or any act of obedience, are not requir|ed under the go&s;pel as <HI>duties</HI> or <HI>conditions</HI> of obtaining the holy &s;pirit, in its vital influences, or of pardon, ju&s;tification and eternal life, but only as <HI>graces</HI> or the <HI>means of receiving</HI> the&s;e benefits.
<PB N="55" REF="020704_0054_0FB0A686EE595758">
And &s;hall we exhort &s;inners fir&s;t, in the neglect of the&s;e means, to wait 'till they receive the holy &s;pirit, and a good heart, and then to hear and u&s;e the means appointed by God, in the u&s;e of which they are to receive them? Is not this to pervert the order that God hath e&s;tabli&s;hed? Faith comes by hearing: but &s;hall &s;inners be exhorted to wait for faith before they hear?&mdash;The &s;pirit comes by hearing, but &s;hall &s;inners wait 'tilll they receive the &s;pirit be|fore they hear? or &s;hall &s;inners be told that there is no <HI>probability</HI> of receiving the &s;pirit or faith by hearing, unle&s;s they fir&s;t have that good heart which the law requires?</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, If unregenerate &s;inners may do that before re|generation, by which the holy &s;pirit is received in its vital influ|ences, and &s;o hath a connection with eternal life, will they not have rea&s;on to boa&s;t as <HI>making them&s;elves</HI> to differ from tho&s;e who do not obtain &s;alvation?&mdash;To this I an&s;wer, That the Apo&s;tle clears this objection&mdash;See 1 Cor. iv. 7. "For who maketh thee to dif|fer from another? And what ha&s;t thou that thou did&s;t not <HI>receive?</HI> Now, if thou did&s;t <HI>receive</HI> it, why do&s;t thou glory as if thou had&s;t not <HI>received</HI> it?" If we do not earn, procure, merit or purcha&s;e any fa|vour, by all we do, but only <HI>receive</HI> it, as a beggar doth a free gift, what rea&s;on have we to glory or boa&s;t as if we made our&s;elves to differ from others, who do not <HI>receive</HI> it? If we <HI>procured, pur|cha&s;ed</HI> or <HI>meritted</HI> it by what we do, then we &s;hould have whereof to glory. The truth, the &s;pirit, the Saviour and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and pardon, ju&s;tification and eternal life, are all procured by God, and &s;ent down from heaven in the go&s;pel; and &s;inners have nothing to do but to <HI>receive</HI> them as they are therein offered, by receiving the knowledge of the truth; and this none can do for them. But their <HI>merely receiving</HI> them by <HI>hearing</HI> and by <HI>faith,</HI> gives them no rea&s;on to boa&s;t or glory. It is by <HI>hearing</HI> and by <HI>faith,</HI> that &s;alva|tion is <HI>received,</HI> that it may be by grace; and thus the Apo&s;tle ar|gues, Eph. ii. 8.9. By grace are ye &s;aved <HI>through faith,</HI> and therefore not of your&s;elves; &s;alvation is the gift of God. Not of works le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t. We do not change our heart our|&s;elves, nor work faith in our&s;elves, nor work out any righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own, but they are all the <HI>gift</HI> of God, and the work of his &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Hath a condemned rebel any rea&s;on to glory, when a pardon is offered to him freely by his prince, and the prince inclines him to embrace it, (upon his hearing it) merely becau&s;e he received and heared it? It is true, if he never had heard and under&s;tood it, he never could have felt the influence of the truths contained in it; but this gives him no rea&s;on to boa&s;t.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, Is there not danger of promoting and encoura|ging a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit by &s;uch exhortations?&mdash;To this I an|&s;wer,

That &s;uch as are directed, exhorted, and prevailed upon to at|tend, hear, and under&s;tand the truths of the go&s;pel, &s;o as to obtain this &s;peculative, orthodox knowledge, and under the direction and influence of this, are praying, &s;eeking, and crying for mercy, are in <HI>no danger</HI> of entertaining a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit: but it is tho&s;e who cannot be prevailed upon to attend, hear and under&s;tand, &s;o as to obtain this knowledge of the truth, that are in danger of this. The rea&s;on why the Phari&s;ees, in our Saviour's time, entertained &s;uch a &s;pirit, was their <HI>ignorance</HI> of the go&s;pel method of &s;alvation. And the rea&s;on why the Jews in the Apo&s;tle's time indulged this &s;pi|rit, was their <HI>lack</HI> of this knowledge; and they could not be prevail|ed upon to hear and learn, &s;o as to obtain it. The rea&s;on why they went about to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own, and did not &s;ub|mit to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, was becau&s;e they were <HI>ignorant</HI> of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, as revealed in the go&s;pel&mdash;See Rom. x. 3, Remove this ignorance, by obtaining this orthodox knowledge, and a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit will be &s;oon cured; but it cannot be cured without this.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, Are there any <HI>promi&s;es</HI> made in &s;cripture to the&s;e exerci&s;es and endeavours of unregenerate, chri&s;tle&s;s &s;inners? And if not, what encouragement have they to exert them?&mdash;To this I an&s;wer, That I grant there are no <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> promi&s;es made to the&s;e exerci&s;es and endeavours, and there is no <HI>indi&s;&s;oluble connection</HI> between &s;inners exerting the&s;e exerci&s;es and endeavours, and their obtaining any &s;aving benefit: yet there is &s;uch a <HI>probable connection</HI> as gives them &s;ufficient encouragement to exert them in the mo&s;t vigorous and per&s;evering manner, in order to obtain this orthodox knowledge of the truths of divine revelation, free from errors and prejudices; &s;ince this is the only way in which &s;alvation can be re|ceived by &s;inners. And if they receive it not in this way, they mu&s;t peri&s;h for the lack of this knowledge. Do we not all exert our endeavours in worldly concerns upon &s;uch a probability? Doth not the farmer ri&s;e early, and &s;et up late; till his land, and plant and &s;ow? Doth not the merchant venture his whole intere&s;t to &s;ea, and the &s;oldier face death in all its formidable &s;hapes, upon a le&s;s probability? And is not this accounted a part of wi&s;dom in them? And is it not then a part of wi&s;dom in peri&s;hing &s;inners, to u&s;e tho&s;e means, and improve tho&s;e opportunities, in the u&s;e of which alone, they can expect to <HI>receive</HI> the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls? When the probability of obtaining in this way is &s;o great, and the con&s;e|quences of their obtaining or not obtaining are &s;o very important. If &s;inners watch daily at wi&s;dom's gates, and wait at the po&s;ts of her doors; if they attend to the holy &s;criptures, and incline their ear to wi&s;dom and apply their heart to under&s;tanding; if they &s;eek her as &s;ilver and &s;earch for her as for hid trea&s;ure; they need not

fear but they will obtain this orthodox knowledge: and if they ob|tain this <HI>knowledge</HI> of &s;alvation, there is a <HI>great probability</HI> that they will obtain the &s;alvation it&s;elf. There is a great probability (if not a certainty) that by obtaining this knowledge of the truth, they will <HI>receive</HI> the &s;pirit of truth; and &s;o convictions, repentance, faith and <HI>love,</HI> through the influences of the word and &s;pirit of truth, and then eternal life will be begun in their &s;ouls. And it is highly probable, that not one in ten thou&s;and, who have obtain|ed this knowledge free from e&s;&s;ential errors, in this life, ever fail|ed of eternal &s;alvation: and, perhaps, none ever fail but &s;uch, as through an inordinate love of the world, and of error and &s;in, and out of enmity and malice to the truth it&s;elf, &s;in wilfully after they have received the knowledge of it; and to them there remains no more &s;acrifice for &s;in. And if any think they have obtained this knowledge, when they do not feel the&s;e effects upon their &s;ouls, they deceive them&s;elves: for our Saviour tells us expre&s;sly, <HI>"Every man,</HI> therefore, that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me."&mdash;See John vi. 45.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, If this &s;peculative knowledge of the truths con|tained in divine revelation, mu&s;t be obtained, before any one can receive the holy &s;pirit in its vital influences, &s;o as to be regenerated, or exerci&s;e repentance, faith, love, or any &s;aving grace, what be|comes of infants, who die before they are capable of receiving this knowledge; and of heathen, who have not the means of this know|ledge?&mdash;To this I an&s;wer, That we have an account in &s;cripture, of a certain <HI>&s;upernatural, &s;piritual change,</HI> of which all the <HI>corrupt</HI> race of Adam mu&s;t be the &s;ubjects, before they enter heaven: all that die in the moments of death, and all that &s;hall be alive and re|main, till the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, at the &s;ound of the la&s;t trum|pet: and all who are the &s;ubjects of this change, at death, in the moment in which the union between the &s;oul and body is di&s;&s;olving, all <HI>moral corruption</HI> and <HI>evil</HI> &s;hall be removed from the &s;oul, and it &s;hall be made perfect in holine&s;s, and prepared to pa&s;s immediately into glory. And in order to the producing this change, no know|ledge of the truth in the under&s;tanding of the &s;ubject of it, is nece&s;|&s;ary; but it is produced by the <HI>immediate</HI> almighty power of the &s;pirit of God. And the believer in Chri&s;t, who hath by faith in his merit given up him&s;elf and offspring to God, according to the covenant of grace, hath as good a foundation, from the declarations and promi&s;es of the covenant of grace to hope, that his infant child, that dies before it is capable of receiving the knowledge of the truth, may be the &s;ubject of this change as him&s;elf, who hath re|ceived the knowledge of the truth. But none have any warrant from &s;cripture (that I can &s;ee) to expect any other &s;aving change will be produced in their own &s;ouls, or the &s;ouls of their children that
<PB N="58" REF="020704_0057_0FB0A68BD81373C0">
live to be capable of <HI>moral</HI> exerci&s;es, unle&s;s they fir&s;t attend to the truth, as it is in Je&s;us, and receive the &s;peculative knowledge of it, in &s;ome degree, &s;o as to receive the &s;pirit and exerci&s;e faith in the atonement. I doubt not but God is able, before death, to rec|tify the principle, and change the heart of tho&s;e who have no degree of this knowledge in their under&s;tanding: but I do not find that he hath any where declared in his word that he will; and I know of no in&s;tance in which he hath done it: for tho' it is &s;aid concerning Jeremiah, that, before he came forth put of his mother's womb, God &s;anctified him, and ordained him to be a prophet unto the na|tions. And concerning Paul, that God &s;eperated him from his mo|ther's womb to reveal his Son in him; yet the&s;e declarations do not imply that either of them were regenerated in their infancy; but only that they were by divine appointment &s;eperated, &s;anctified or &s;et apart to office. But it appears incon&s;i&s;tent with the method of divine operation, to produce a principle of &s;piritual life in the &s;oul <HI>long</HI> before provision is made for the &s;upport of it, by the know|ledge of the truth. And if this moral corruption is <HI>removed,</HI> by the &s;pirit of God in infancy, then &s;uch a child is free from original &s;in and moral corruption, and different from the re&s;t of mankind, none of whom are freed from it till death.</P>
<P>But I think parents have no warrant from &s;cripture to hope that any of their children, that live to be capable of receiving this know|ledge, will receive the &s;pirit, or be regenerated, till this knowledge of the truth is obtained by <HI>hearing</HI> and <HI>learning</HI> in&s;truction from the word of God.</P>
<P>And it is of the la&s;t importance, in this view of the matter, that parents begin early to in&s;truct their children, and indoctrinate them in the truths of the go&s;pel, as they value their &s;ouls; and u&s;e the&s;e be&s;t endeavours to prevent their minds being corrupted by reading <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ad books, and hearkening to in&s;tructions which tend to prejudice their minds again&s;t the truth, and the orthodox mini&s;ters of the go&s;|pel. Parents &s;hould train up their children in the <HI>nurture</HI> and ad|monition of the Lord. "Whom &s;hall he teach knowledge? (&s;aith the prophet) Whom &s;hall he make to under&s;tand doctrine? Them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the brea&s;ts; for precept mu&s;t be upon precept; precept upon precept; line upon line; line upon line; here a little and there a little."&mdash;I&s;a. xxviii. 9.10.&mdash;And if parents would thus train up their children to at|tend, hear and learn the <HI>truth,</HI> which is the <HI>way</HI> in which they &s;hould go, they have great rea&s;on to hope, that they will <HI>receive</HI> the Knowledge of the <HI>truth,</HI> and the <HI>&s;pirit of truth,</HI> and the love of the truth; and when they are old they will not depart from <HI>it.</HI> Some children have obtained &s;o much knowledge of the truth at four years old, as hopefully to receive the &s;pirit in its &s;aving influences; where
<PB N="59" REF="020704_0058_0FB0A68CDDFE3CE8">
their attention to the truth hath been excited, in &s;uch early life, by the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e under convictions, and &s;erious impre&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>And children &s;hould con&s;ider of what importance it is, in this view, to attend to religious in&s;tructions in early life; when their minds are mo&s;t free from prejudices and errors. And then it may be &s;aid of you that are young, to your great honour and everla&s;ting happine&s;s, as it was of Timothy, That from children you have <HI>known</HI> the holy &s;criptures, which are able to make you wi&s;e to &s;alvation, through faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. But if you will not attend and obtain this knowledge now, you will mourn at the la&s;t, when your fle&s;h and body is con&s;umed, &s;aying, "How have I hated in|&s;truction, and my heart de&s;pi&s;ed reproof? And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that in&s;tructed me? (I was whi&s;pering, or laughing, or &s;leeping, or my eyes and heart were wandering) and I was almo&s;t in all evil, in the mid&s;t of the congregation and a&s;&s;embly."&mdash; See Prov. v. 11 &amp;c.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion. As to the heathen, or tho&s;e who have not the written word; though God is under no obligati|on to &s;end the <HI>means</HI> of knowledge to any people, yet, the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, that the go&s;pel hath been preached to every creature which is under heaven&mdash;See Col. i. 23. "And have not they all heard (&s;aith the apo&s;tle) their &s;ound went unto all the earth, and their word unto the ends of the world."&mdash;See Rom. x. 18. So that all nations may have the <HI>means</HI> of knowledge, though they have not the written word. But &s;uch as have not capacities, means or opportunities of obtaining this knowledge, will not be condemned for not receiving the &s;pirit, or not repenting, or not believing in Chri&s;t; but for the want of that <HI>principle</HI> of love to God, and <HI>obe|dience</HI> to his will, which is required in the moral law, or in the law of nature, written on men's hearts. But all tho&s;e who are favoured with the go&s;pel, and have capacities to obtain this know|ledge, and do not improve the capacities, means and opportunities they have, will have this for their aggravated condemnation; that light is come into the world, and they have loved darkne&s;s rather than light, and would not come to the light.</P>
<P>But to conclude, We are all &s;en&s;ible that ignorance of the &s;av|ing truths of the go&s;pel prevails at the pre&s;ent day; notwith&s;tand|ing all the <HI>means</HI> of knowledge we enjoy. And by rea&s;on of this ignorance and error is over&s;preading the chri&s;tian world like a flood: and iniquity abounds; and the love of many waxes cold. And what method &s;hall be taken for a remedy? The only probable method is this; The mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, like the living crea|tures in Ezekiel's vi&s;ion, mu&s;t take the lead in this affair. They mu&s;t wake up, and preach the law, and go&s;pel di&s;tinctly; and
<PB N="60" REF="020704_0059_0FB0A6909781AB70">
not blend them together; but rightly divide the word of truth, and exhort, and &s;tir up the attention of &s;inners to the truth, by the manife&s;tation of it to every man's con&s;cience; and by this means remove the darkne&s;s, and ignorance and error that overvails their their under&s;tandings, and communicate to them the true know|ledge of the &s;criptures: for this is not the work of the &s;pirit, but of the word of truth. And withal pray earne&s;tly that the law may prove a mini&s;tration of condemnation and death to their &s;ins; and the go&s;pel a mini&s;tration of the &s;pirit, of righteou&s;ne&s;s and life to their &s;ouls. And then exhort &s;inners under the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed influen|ces, to repent of &s;in, believe in Chri&s;t, love God, and bring forth the fruits of the &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Should we excite in &s;inners minds &s;trong conditions of their &s;in and danger, by &s;etting before them the terrors of the law, and exhorting them to repent; yet unle&s;s by obtaining this knowledge of the go&s;pel method of &s;alvation, ignorance and error are remov|ed from their under&s;tandings, they will be in imminent danger of &s;ettling down on a fal&s;e foundation; and receiving a fal&s;e hope and joy; notwith&s;tanding any internal influences of the &s;pirit that they can receive by hearing the law. To attend to the go&s;pel, and read it, and hear it preached; and &s;eek to have a right un|der&s;tanding of the truths contained in it; is the fir&s;t and principal direction to be be given to &s;inners, that are under awakenings and convictions. For by the knowledge of the truth, the &s;pirit mu&s;t be received, in its regenerating influences; and this knowledge mu&s;t lay the foundation for the exerci&s;e of every grace in the &s;oul. And the hope and joy of &s;inners, if not founded in the knowledge of the truth, will finally leave them a&s;hamed.</P>
<P><HI>If we are wi&s;e preachers, we &s;hall teach the people knowledge. And if we are pa&s;tors according to God's heart, we &s;hall feed them with knowledge and under&s;tanding:</HI> and with Paul, <HI>we &s;hall rea&s;on with them out of the &s;criptures.</HI> And to arre&s;t their attention, we are not fir&s;t to addre&s;s our&s;elves to their <HI>love</HI> of the truth, but to their fears of hell; and endeavour to convince them of the nece&s;&s;ity and importance of their receiving the knowledge of the truth, as the only means of pre&s;erving the life, and re&s;toring the health of their precious and immortal &s;ouls. And &s;inners mu&s;t hear and &s;eek to obtain the knowledge of the truth with &s;ilent attention; and de|pend on the word, and &s;pirit of truth to move their affections; excite convictions, repentance, faith and love in their hearts; and then they will be genuine.</P>
<P>And all &s;inners, who have capacity, means and opportunity of obtaining this knowledge, are under infinite obligation to repent of &s;in, believe Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and love God, and give them&s;elves up to him with all their heart <HI>immediately,</HI> and be baptized, and come

to his table; and their want of this knowledge doth not excu&s;e their neglect one moment. Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles exhorted &s;inners to repent, believe and love God, and become friends to Chri&s;t <HI>immediately,</HI> and made no allowance for their <HI>want</HI> of know|ledge; though it is e&s;&s;ential to the exerci&s;e of every grace.&mdash;But in&s;tead of making the <HI>want</HI> of it an excu&s;e for their continuing impenitent and in unbelief, under the light of the go&s;pel, they con|&s;ider it as the formal cau&s;e of their blame, and mo&s;t aggravated condemnation.&mdash;And they exhort them to repent and believe im|mediately, though at the &s;ame time they let them know that they cannot come to Chri&s;t 'till they <HI>hear</HI> and <HI>learn</HI> of the Father. But their not hearing and learning and obtaining this knowledge, where they have the means, is no excu&s;e for their impenitency and unbelief.&mdash;And their hearing and learning and obtaining this knowledge, will not &s;ave them in their impenitency and unbelief, or be any alleviation of their condemnation; but will greatly ag|gravate it if they finally peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The holy &s;criptures are a compleat and perfect rule; and the only rule to direct &s;inners to happine&s;s; as you may &s;ee, 2 Tim. iii. 15.16.17. Let no man, therefore, that de&s;ires to be a preacher of the go&s;pel, depend on the light of natural rea&s;on, or on human wi&s;dom, or on the internal light or influences of the holy &s;pirit in regeneration, or on his &s;piritual knowledge or love of the truth, or on any new revelation, to teach and in&s;truct him what to &s;ay, in or|der to excite affections in others: but fir&s;t &s;eek to obtain this ortho|dox knowledge of the holy &s;criptures, which Timothy had before he was regenerated; and keep up his attention to this, 'till he finds he hath obtained a large degree of it, and al&s;o received the holy &s;pirit in its vital influences, and the &s;piritual knowledge, or love of the truth, and &s;aving faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; before he begins to preach: for the light of natural rea&s;on, or human wi&s;dom, or this internal light or <HI>love</HI> of divine truth, qualifies no man to preach the go&s;pel, unle&s;s he fir&s;t obtain a good degree of this orthodox know|ledge of the holy &s;criptures. "To the law and to the te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not according to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them."&mdash;I&s;a. viii. 20. For mini&s;ters to tell their own ex|periences, or the experiences of others, or dreams or vi&s;ions, and impul&s;es and feelings, to excite affections in others, is not preach|ing the word of God, which is the only <HI>infallible rule</HI>; but &s;uch preaching cau&s;es people to err and think light of the word of God, and forget his name&mdash;See Jer. xxiii. 26.27.28, "The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him &s;peak my word <HI>faithfully</HI>: what is the chaff to the wheat? &s;aith the Lord. Is not my word like a fire? &s;aith the Lord; and
<PB N="62" REF="020704_0061_0FB0A6930D013D28">
like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" By this rule, every &s;pirit mu&s;t be tried, to know whether it be of God or not. "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the &s;oul&mdash;P&s;al. xix. 7.</P>
<P>By the law of the Lord here, we are not to under&s;tand the <HI>moral law</HI> exclu&s;ive of the go&s;pel; but the word of God including both: for the moral law is only a mini&s;tration of condemnation and death, and all that this law can do, is to <HI>convince</HI> and <HI>condemn</HI> the &s;inner: it cannot <HI>convert</HI> without the go&s;pel, which is the only mini&s;tration of the &s;pirit, of righteou&s;ne&s;s and of life; and unle&s;s a &s;inner hath the knowledge of Chri&s;t, and faith in him, he never will be converted from the love of &s;in to the love of holine&s;s, by the preaching of the moral law. It is only where the go&s;pel comes that &s;inners are re|generated and converted.</P>
<P>But if dei&s;ts or infidels, arians, &s;ocinians, &s;elf-righteous moral|i&s;ts, anti-nomians, univer&s;ali&s;ts and enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who are led away by &s;uch errors and delu&s;ions at the pre&s;ent day, could but be pre|vailed upon, &s;o to attend to the go&s;pel as to obtain an orthodox knowledge and under&s;tanding of it, what a great alteration it would cau&s;e in their minds? How &s;oon it would remove their ignorance, errors and prejudices; humble their pride, overcome their enmity, mortify their &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit, convert their &s;ouls, and make them wi&s;e to &s;alvation? But if they cannot be prevailed upon to at|tend to the go&s;pel, and under&s;tand the truths of it, they mu&s;t peri&s;h for lack of this knowledge and conviction, tho' they have means in plenty, becau&s;e they will not make u&s;e of them!</P>
<P>And &s;inners, by turning a deaf ear to the truths of the go&s;pel, &s;hut|ting their eyes again&s;t the light, and rejecting the means of know|ledge, vex the holy &s;pirit of God, &s;tifle his ble&s;&s;ed motions on their hearts, quench his influences, and &s;end him away grieved; and &s;o reject God and Chri&s;t, and his go&s;pel, and judge them&s;elves un|worthy of eternal life; and provoke God to &s;ay, "My &s;pirit &s;hall no longer &s;trive with them; but I will give them up to their own hearts lu&s;ts, to walk in their own coun&s;els."&mdash;See P&s;al. lxxxi. And God will become their irreconcileable enemy, and fight again&s;t them; and &s;wear in his wrath, that they &s;hall never enter into his re&s;t. "And becau&s;e they received not the <HI>truth</HI> in the love of it, that they might be &s;aved, God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould believe a lie; that they all may be damned who be|lieve not the truth; but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s." And when they go down to hell, their <HI>neglect</HI> of <HI>particular</HI> opportunities of attending and &s;eeking will haunt their guilty con&s;ciences for ever and ever. And they will not be able then to relieve their minds by ca&s;ting off any blame from them&s;elves upon the decrees of God, as the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of their not being regenerated and &s;aved&mdash;
<PB N="63" REF="020704_0062_0FB0A6946100E9E0">
To &s;ay, the rea&s;on why they were not regenerated was, becau&s;e they were not elected, or becau&s;e they were decreed from all eter|nity to damnation; and therefore God could not regenerate them, would be bla&s;phemy again&s;t God; &mdash;&s;ince the only cau&s;e will appear to be, their not improving their capacities, means and opportuni|ties of attending to the holy &s;criptures, &s;o as to obtain the know|ledge of the &s;aving truths therein contained, or rejecting them with enmity and malice.</P>
<P>And how great mu&s;t be the &s;in and guilt of tho&s;e, who &s;ay any thing that tends to di&s;courage unregenerate &s;inners in u&s;ing the means, or attending on a preached go&s;pel? Such are acce&s;&s;ary to the great evil of de&s;troying &s;ouls; by cau&s;ing them to provoke God to withdraw his holy &s;pirit.</P>
<P>And what great rea&s;on have &s;inners to condemn them&s;elves, and lament their folly, that they have neglected &s;o many means and op|portunities of obtaining the knowledge of the&s;e divine and &s;av|ing truths!&mdash;And for the time to come to double their diligence!</P>
<P>And if you want <HI>evidence</HI> for faith, look into the word of God, and &s;ee how all the types and prophecies are fullfilled in Chri&s;t. The types have a peculiar re&s;pect to his being delivered up by his Father; and offering up him&s;elf, his liberty, life and <HI>divine glory</HI>; to be conquered, &s;lain and reproached by his enemies, and &s;o by them be made a victim and &s;acrifice. And the prophecies have a peculiar reference to his conquering and &s;laying his enemies, by means of his being thus conquered and &s;lain by them; and &s;o final|ly making them his victims and &s;acrifice. And who could have pointed out this wonderful affair, in &s;uch a clear manner, in &s;uch early ages, but a God of infinite wi&s;dom? Attend to this plan of &s;alvation, and you will find it carries its own evidence with it. Ob|tain the true knowledge and under&s;tanding of it, and &s;ee what a &s;trange effect this knowledge and conviction of divine truth will have upon your minds; when attended with the &s;pirit of truth!&mdash;What a wonderful effect it had upon the mind of <HI>Soame Jenyns,</HI> E&s;q. He was once a &s;trong dei&s;t, but he tells us, that when he ap|plied his mind to the &s;tudy of the holy &s;cripture, "on a candid in|quiry he &s;oon found that its preten&s;ions of a &s;upernatural revelation from God were founded on the mo&s;t &s;olid grounds." And what a wonderful effect hath this knowledge had upon the minds of igno|rant, erroneous, &s;elf righteous and &s;tout hearted &s;inners, that were far from having a good heart, or any righteou&s;ne&s;s that could &s;ave them, when they fir&s;t attended to it?</P>
<P>And if you want <HI>power</HI> and <HI>&s;trength</HI> to remove the moral corrup|tion of your hearts, and enable you to repent of &s;in, and believe in Chri&s;t, and work out your own &s;alvation: attend to the go&s;pel;
<PB N="64" REF="020704_0063_0FB0A695E05121E0">
hear and under&s;tand the truths therein contained. This is the on|ly way to have the &s;pirit of God work in you, to will and to do, of his good plea&s;ure. It is only through the knowledge of the truths of the go&s;pel that you can receive from God grace to pardon or &s;trength to help. You can derive no &s;aving influences but in this way.&mdash;O prize divine revelation! Ble&s;s God for the go&s;pel! give heed to it, as to a light that &s;hines in a dark place! On the word of God you mu&s;t tru&s;t. On this you mu&s;t found all your hopes. From this the believer derives all his comforts&mdash;all his &s;trength and all his joys! Improve the go&s;pel, as you value your &s;ouls eternal peace and happine&s;s. Sell all to purcha&s;e this field, which con|tains this trea&s;ure of great price! Love to the word is the be&s;t evidence of love to God.</P>
<P>And if you want motive to repent and believe, attend to the truths of the go&s;pel. The go&s;pel contains &s;ufficient motives, and they will prove effectual if you attend to them; and they are accompanied by the efficacious influences of the &s;pirit of God: and you cannot expect the&s;e efficacious influences in any other way, but by ob|taining this knowledge.</P>
<P>And will you neglect and mi&s;improve all your pre&s;ent privileges and opportunities of receiving this great &s;alvation, upon a vain pre&s;umption that you will have another &s;tate of probation, and time of trial, after this life is ended? And that your puni&s;hment will not be eternal though you die under the power and guilt of &s;in, in impenitency and unbelief.&mdash;It is very evident that the doctrine of universal &s;alvation, or another &s;tate of probation for &s;inners is not from God; and is not contained in divine revelation&mdash;Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles never preached it; if they had, the contrary doc|trine never could have had &s;uch a &s;pread in the world; nor would they have been per&s;ecuted as they were; becau&s;e this doctrine is &s;o agreeable to the corrupt ta&s;te of mankind, and gives them &s;uch a high &s;ecurity for another world; that they would have held fa&s;t the doctrine upon &s;o great an authority, and carre&s;&s;ed the di&s;pen&s;ers of it. And if it had been true, undoubtedly our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour could and would have taught it plainly, without any re&s;erve, Je&s;us Chri&s;t taught the contrary. He declares, that he that believes not &s;hall be damned. But as the devil contradicted the expre&s;s decla|ration of God to our fir&s;t parents; &s;o he doth now the expre&s;s decla|ration of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour.</P>
<P>But if what hath been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject is true, &s;in is an infinite evil, and the &s;inner doth de&s;erve an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and God cannot remit it con&s;i&s;tently with his righteou&s;ne&s;s, as mo|ral Governour, unle&s;s the &s;inner is united to Chri&s;t by faith and &s;o intere&s;ted in that infinite atonement and &s;ati&s;faction which
<PB N="65" REF="020704_0064_0FB0A69762FF88A0">
he hath made at &s;uch an infinite expence. And &s;inners may re|ceive this atonement new, if they will; and it is &s;ufficient for all. And the offer is made to all that hear the go&s;pel. And all that have &s;ufficient capacities, means and opportunities to obtain the knowledge of it mu&s;t be without excu&s;e, if they do not believe in Chri&s;t, and receive this &s;alvation immediately. And if they <HI>will|fully</HI> mi&s;improve. all the&s;e now, what rea&s;on can be given why they &s;hould have another &s;tate of probation; God hath no where revealed any other &s;tate of probation; and rea&s;on forbids there &s;hould be another. And all the perfections of God &s;tand oppo&s;ed to it. God hath declared in his word, that whom this &s;tate is at an end with &s;inners, his &s;pirit &s;hall no longer &s;trive with them. He that is filthy mu&s;t therefore remain &s;o &s;till. And that &s;inners are expo&s;ed to <HI>eternal damnation</HI>; and that their puni&s;hment &s;hall be <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> and have no end, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed in any &s;tronger terms, of which we can conceive. The <HI>eternity</HI> of &s;inners torments are expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame words by which the eternity of God's exi&s;tence, and the duration of the &s;aints happine&s;s in heaven are expre&s;&s;ed. And had God revealed another &s;tate of probation for tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed <HI>willfully</HI> to neglect and mi&s;improve the pre&s;ent, he mu&s;t future &s;tate the whole de&s;ign of this &s;tate. And you cannot expect any future &s;tate of probation, unle&s;s God &s;hould deny him&s;elf, prove <HI>fal&s;e</HI> to his threatening, and <HI>flexible</HI> in his ju&s;tice, and <HI>unkind</HI> to the loyal &s;ubjects of his kingdom; by de&s;troying the very foundation of moral government. But if you believe not, "God abideth faithful, he cannot deny him&s;elf."</P>
<P>And is it po&s;&s;ible that Doctor <HI>Chauncy,</HI> with all his learning, and corrupt critici&s;m&mdash;or that the dei&s;ts, and univer&s;ali&s;ts can per&s;uade men, that have the holy &s;criptures in their hands, and are endued with rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, capable of judging and de|termining what is be&s;t, to believe that they are acting a wi&s;e part, when they <HI>willfully</HI> neglect and mi&s;improve the pre&s;ent glorious opportunities and advantages for &s;ecuring to them&s;elves a ble&s;&s;ed immortality; upon the <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI> that God will grant them an|other &s;tate of probation; if they <HI>wilfully</HI> abu&s;e this!&mdash;But O look forward to the great day&mdash;when Chri&s;t &s;hall be revealed from heaven to take vengeance on them that now <HI>know</HI> not God and <HI>obey</HI> not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who mu&s;t be puni&s;hed with <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord and the <HI>glory of his power!</HI></P>
<P>And do you not believe there will be &s;uch a day! when the heavens &s;hall be on fire, and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat, and the earth and all things that are therein &s;hall be burnt up. And the Judge &s;hall de&s;cend, with all his angels; and the

<P>And oh how happy will be your ca&s;e then, if you &s;hall be found to have &s;o well improved your pre&s;ent opportunities, and &s;tate of pro|bation, as to <HI>receive</HI> the knowledge and &s;pirit of truth, and the Sa|viour; and be cloathed with his infinite righteou&s;ne&s;s and merit, and adorned with the graces of his &s;pirit?

Then will you hear that heart-re|viving &s;entence, "Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the king|dom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" And them you will be admitted into the joy of your Lord; where you will &s;pend an eternity in &s;inging anthems to Him, who hath loved you and wa&s;hed you in his own blood from all your &s;ins. To which ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate and employment, may God of his infinite mercy, in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, bring us all. AMEN.</P>
