<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Memoirs and Letters of the late Major General Lee, have been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Editor &s;ince the year 1786. They were tran&s;mitted from America to Eng|land by the gentleman who&s;e name is &s;ub&s;cribed to the Memoirs, and who was a member of Congre&s;s for the &s;tate of Georgia, for the pur|po&s;e of publication. In their manu&s;cript &s;tate they have been &s;een by &s;everal per&s;ons in Eng|land, who expre&s;&s;ed a &s;trong de&s;ire of putting them to the pre&s;s, which the avocations of the per&s;on to whom they were entru&s;ted, and his not being acquainted with &s;uch undertakings, had cau&s;ed him to neglect.</P>
<P>As the &s;ubject of Revolutions is again renew|ed by what has occurred in France, it is pre|&s;umed, that whatever relates to the Mother-Revolution, that of America will, at lea&s;t, afford entertainment to the curious, and contribute to encrea&s;e the general &s;tock of hi&s;torical know|ledge.</P>
<P>The reader may expect to find, in almo&s;t eve|ry thing that relates to General Lee, a great deal of the &s;trong republican character. His attach|ment to principles of liberty, without regard to place, made him the citizen of the world rather than of any country; and from his earlie&s;t youth to the end of his career, this general trait in his character may be traced.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="024456_0003_0FC7347C03E92CC8">So little of the courtier had he about him, that he never de&s;cended to intimate any thing. Whatever he &s;poke or wrote was in the fulle&s;t &s;tyle of expre&s;&s;ion, or &s;trong figure. He u&s;ed to &s;ay of Mr. Paine, the author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> in America, and &s;ince of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> in Eng|land, (of who&s;e writings he was a great admir|er) that <HI>"he bur&s;t forth upon the world like Jove in thunder;"</HI> and this &s;trength of conception, &s;o natural to General Lee, had it not been mix|ed with a turn equally as &s;trong for &s;atire, and too much eccentricity of temper, would have rendered his conver&s;ation perpetually entertain|ing.</P>
<P>Though the Memoirs and every Letter in this publication are mo&s;t faithfully printed from the copy tran&s;mitted from America, the Editor has omitted many whole letters, and al&s;o his trial before the Court Martial, as not &s;ufficiently in|tere&s;ting to balance the expence to which they would have extended the work. But if any of the particular friends or relations of General Lee &s;hould be de&s;irous of &s;eeing them, they may be indulged with the opportunity, by leaving a line at the publi&s;hers, directed to the</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF <HI>Major General Lee.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE family of the Lees is both ancient and re&s;|pectable, many of them having had connections and intermarriages with the principal families in the En|gli&s;h nation; and, from a pedigree done for Mr. Tho|mas Lee,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1723.</NOTE> di&s;tributor and collector of the &s;tamp-duties for the county and city of Che&s;ter, North Wales, we learn, that the General's father was John Lee of Dern|hall, in the &s;aid county, who was &s;ome time a Captain of Dragoons, afterwards Lieutenant Colonel of General Barrel's regiment from 1717 to 1742, at which time he was promoted to a Regiment of Foot. He married I&s;a|bella, &s;econd daughter of Sir Henry Bunbury, of Stan|ney, in the county of Che&s;ter, Baronet: by this lady he had three &s;ons, Thomas, Harry, and Charles, the young|e&s;t, who is the &s;ubject of the&s;e memoirs.</P>
<P>From his early youth he was ardent in the pur&s;uit of knowledge; and being an officer at eleven years of age, may be con&s;idered as born in the army; which, though it deprived him of &s;ome regularity with re&s;pect to the mode of his education, yet his genius led him a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to cultivate the fields of &s;cience, and he ac|quired a competent &s;kill in the Greek and Latin; while his fondne&s;s for travelling gave him al&s;o an opportunity of attaining the Italian, Spani&s;h, German, and French languages.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="024456_0009_0FC734926E324B40">Having laid a good foundation, tactics became his fa|vourite &s;tudy, in which he &s;pent much time and pains, de&s;iring nothing more than to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in the profe&s;&s;ion of arms. We find him very early in Ame|rica, commanding a Company of Grenadiers of the 44th regiment; and he was at the battle of Ticonderoga, where General Abercrombie was defeated. Here, it is &s;aid, he was &s;hot through the body; but fortunately his wound did not prove mortal.</P>
<P>When he returned to England from America, after the reduction of Montreal, he found a general peace was in contemplation. The ce&s;&s;ion of Canada was talked of, which gave great unea&s;ine&s;s to every Americ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, as it ap|peared prejudicial to their intere&s;t and &s;afety. On this occa&s;ion he exerted him&s;elf, and publi&s;hed a pamphlet &s;hewing the importance of this country, which was much approved of by all the friends to America. The cele|brated Dr. Franklin, in particular, was plea&s;ed to com|pliment him, and &s;aid "that it could not fail of making a &s;alutary impre&s;&s;ion." In the year 1762, he bore a Co|lonel's commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;erved under General Burgoyne in Portugal; and in this &s;ervice he hand&s;omely di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Spaniards had formed a de&s;ign of invading that kingdom, and had a&s;&s;embled an army on the frontiers of E&s;tremadura, with an intention of penetrating into the province of Alentejo. Count La Lippe was the com|manding officer of the Portugue&s;e army, who formed a de&s;ign of attacking an advanced body of the Spaniards, which lay on their frontiers, in a town called Valentia de Alcantara.</P>
<P>This enterpri&s;e was committed to Brigadier General Burgoyne, who effected a complete &s;urprize on the town, took the general who was to have commanded in the in|tended inva&s;ion, with a number of other officers, and one of the be&s;t regiments in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice was en|tirely de&s;troyed. But notwith&s;tanding this, and &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent &s;kirmi&s;hes, the Spani&s;h army continued ma&s;|ters of the country, and nothing remained but the pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="3" REF="024456_0010_0FC73493A83E1020">
of the Tagus, to enable them to take up their quar|ters in Alentejo.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne, who was po&s;ted with an intention to ob&s;truct them in their pa&s;&s;age, lay in the neighbour|hood, and within view of a detached camp, compo&s;ed of a con&s;iderable body of the enemy's cavalry, which lay near a village called Villa Velha. As he ob&s;erved that the enemy kept no very &s;oldierly guard in this po&s;t, and were uncovered both in their rear and their flanks, he con|ceived a de&s;ign of falling on them by &s;urprize. The ex|ecution of his de&s;ign was entru&s;ted to his friend Colonel Lee, who, in the night of October 8th, fell upon their rear, turned their camp, made a con&s;iderable &s;laughter, di&s;per&s;ed the whole party, de&s;troyed their magazines, and returned with &s;carce any lo&s;s.</P>
<P>When a general conclu&s;ion was at length put to the war, he returned to England from Portugal, after having received the thanks of his Portugue&s;e Maje&s;ty for his &s;ervices; and Count La Lippe recommended him in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to the Engli&s;h Court. He had, at this period, a friend and patron in high office, one of the principal Secretaries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> State; &s;o that there was every rea&s;on for him to have expected promotion in the En|gli&s;h army. But here his attachment, his enthu&s;ia&s;m for America, interfered, and prevented. The great Indian, or what we called Pondiacks War, broke out, which the mini&s;terial agents thought their intere&s;t to repre&s;ent as a matter of no con&s;equence. The friends of America thought the rever&s;e, and a&s;&s;erted it would be attended with dreadful wa&s;te, ravage, and de&s;olation. This brought him once more to publi&s;h for the defence and protection of this country, by which he lo&s;t the favour of the mini&s;|try, and &s;hut the door to all hopes of preferment in the Engli&s;h army. But he could not live in idlene&s;s and inactivity: he left his native country, and entered into the Poli&s;h &s;ervice, and was of cour&s;e ab&s;ent when the &s;tamp act pa&s;&s;ed; but although ab&s;ent, he did not cea&s;e labouring in the cau&s;e of America, as may be learned from many of his letters. He u&s;ed every argument, and
<PB N="4" REF="024456_0011_0FC7349945CE0DB0">
exerted all the abilities he was ma&s;ter of, with every corre&s;pondent he had, in either Hou&s;e of Parliament, of any weight or influence; and at the &s;ame time, he had not an incon&s;iderable number in both.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this famous act had divided almo&s;t every court in Europe into two different parties: the one, a&s;&s;ertors of the prerogative of the Briti&s;h Parli|ament; the other, of the rights and privileges of Ame|rica. General Lee, on this occa&s;ion, pleaded the cau&s;e of the Colonies with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s as almo&s;t to break off all intercour&s;e with the King's mini&s;ters at the Court of Vienna, men that he per&s;onally loved and e&s;teemed; but, at the &s;ame time, it was thought that he pleaded with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s as to add not a few friends and partizans to America. The&s;e circum&s;tances are men|tioned. as they &s;erve to demon&s;trate that a zeal for the welfare of the Colonies, from the General's earlie&s;t ac|quaintance with them, had been a ruling principle of his life. The pre&s;ent volumes will te&s;tify what he &s;a|crificed, what he did, and what he hazarded, in the la&s;t and mo&s;t important conte&s;t which &s;eparated the Colo|nies from their parent &s;tate:&mdash;but there is one circum|&s;tance that &s;eems to claim a particular attention; which is, that of all the officers who embarked in the Ameri|can &s;ervice, he was the only man who could acquire no additional rank, and perhaps the only one who&s;e fortune could not have been impaired, or at lea&s;t the tenure by which it was held, changed from its former condition into a precarious and arbitrary one, by the &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try's &s;chemes; for, had they been complet|ed to the full extent of their wi&s;hes, the condition of his fortune had not been altered for the wor&s;e: his fortune, though not great, was ea&s;y, and, it may be &s;aid, affluent, for a private gentleman; a detail of which the editor is enabled to collect from his papers.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The General had four hundred and eighty pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> on a mortgage in Jamaica, paid punctually.</P>
<P N="1">2dly. An e&s;tate of two hundred pounds <HI>per annum</HI> in Middle&s;ex, for another gentleman's life; but who&s;e life he had in&s;ured again&s;t his own.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="5" REF="024456_0012_0FC7349AC05B1468">3dly. A thou&s;and pounds on a turnpike in England, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> four <HI>per cent.</HI> intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. One thou&s;and five hundred pounds, at five <HI>per cent..</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. His half-pay, one hundred and thirty-&s;ix pounds <HI>per annum;</HI> in all, nine hundred and thirty-one pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> clear income: be&s;ides this, about twelve hun|dred, pounds in his agent's hands, and different debts.&mdash; He had, likewi&s;e, ten thou&s;and acres of land in the i&s;land of St. John, which had been located and &s;ettled at the expence of &s;even hundred pounds; and a mandamus for twenty thou&s;and acres in Ea&s;t Florida.</P>
<P>This is the &s;tate of the General's fortune when he en|gaged in the late American conte&s;t; and this fortune would have been totally unaffected though the prerogative of taxing America without her con&s;ent had been e&s;tab|li&s;hed and confirmed: the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it was &s;ecure, and independent of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">te. But the&s;e con&s;iderations did not influence his mind&punc; he gave up &s;ecurity for in|&s;ecurity, certainty for uncertainty; he threw into the lap of America, without any chance of winning; he &s;taked all on the die of her fortune: if &s;he &s;ucceeded, he could not be bettered; if &s;he mi&s;carried, his whole was lo&s;t. His rank, as before ob&s;erved, acquired no addi|tion; but the contrary, for a &s;top was put to its progre&s;s in the two other &s;ervices, the Poli&s;h and the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The General, who could never &s;tay long in one place, during the years 1771, 1772, to the fall pf 1773, had rambled all over Europe; but we can collect nothing material relative to the adventures of his travels, as his memorandum-books only mention the names of the towns and cities through which he pa&s;&s;ed. That he was a mo&s;t rapid and very active traveller, is evident: it appears al&s;o, that he was engaged with an officer in Italy in an affair of honour, by which he lo&s;t the u&s;e of two of his fingers; but having recour&s;e to pi&s;tols, the Italian was &s;lain, and he immediately obliged to fly for his life. His warmth of temper drew him into many rencounters of this kind; in all which he acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted him&s;elf with &s;ingular courage,
<PB N="5" REF="024456_0013_0FC7349CAE3E8810">
&s;pringhtline&s;s of imagination, and great pre&s;ence of mind.</P>
<P>Much di&s;&s;atisfied with the appearance of the political horizen at London, on the 16th of Augu&s;t 1773, he embarked on board the packet for New-York, where he arrived on the 10th of November following, and had a very &s;evere fit of the gout. At this period, the contro|ver&s;y between Great Britain and her Colonies began to be &s;erious; and the General concerted a de&s;ign of taking a part in favour of America, in ca&s;e it came to an open rupture.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t-India company's tea at Bo&s;ton, the 16th of December, was a prelude to the calamities that afterwards en&s;ued. At this cri&s;is, General Lee's mind was not inob&s;ervant or inactive his conver&s;ation, his pen, animated die coloni&s;ts to a great degree, and per&s;uaded them to make a per&s;evering re&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>During this winter, he vi&s;ited Philadelphia, William&s;|burgh, and &s;everal other places in Virginia and Mary|land; and returned to Philadelphia, a few months before the fir&s;t Congre&s;s met in that city, on the 5th of Sep|tember. Encouraging and ob&s;erving what was going forward here, he then paid a vi&s;it to New-York, Rhode-I&s;land, and Bo&s;ton, where he arrived on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t 1774. The mo&s;t active political characters on the A|merican theatre, now hailed him, and were happy in his acquaintance, not a little plea&s;ed with his &s;anguine, lively temper; con&s;idering his pre&s;ence among them at this cri&s;is, as a mo&s;t fortunate and propitious omen. General Gage had now i&s;&s;ued his proclamation; and though Lee was on half-pay in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, it did not prevent him from expre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments in terms of the mo&s;t pointed &s;everity again&s;t the mini&s;try. In &s;hort, he blazed forth a Whig of the fir&s;t magnitude, and communicated a portion of his &s;pirit to all with whom he conver&s;ed.&mdash; As he continued travelling, or rather flying from place to place, he became known to all who di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves in this important oppo&s;ition: his company and corre&s;pondence were co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed, and many occa&s;ional poli|tical

pieces, the production of his pen, were eagerly read, and much admired; and from this popularity, there is no rea&s;on to doubt but he expected he &s;hould &s;oon become the fir&s;t in military rank on this Continent.</P>
<P>General Gates was &s;ettled on a plantation in Berkley county, Virginia; and having a great friend&s;hip for Lee, per&s;uaded him to purcha&s;e front a Mr. Hite, a very fine valuable tract of land in his neighbourhood, of about two thou&s;and &s;even hundred acres, on which were &s;e|veral good improvements.</P>
<P>On this bu&s;ine&s;s, he left his friends, in the Northern States, and returned to Virginia, where he remained till the month of May 1775, when he again pre&s;ented him&s;elf at Philadelphia. The American Congre&s;s were a&s;&s;em|bled; and he became daily a greater enthu&s;ia&s;t in the cau&s;e of liberty. The battle of Lexington, and &s;ome other matters, had now ripened the conte&s;t; and Lee's active and interpri&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition was ready for the mo&s;t arduous purpo&s;es. He therefore accepted a commi&s;&s;ion from the Congre&s;s, which was offered to him by &s;ome of its principal members; but he found it nece&s;&s;ary previ|ou&s;ly to re&s;ign that which he held in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice. This he did without delay, in a letter tran&s;mitted to the Right Honourable Lord Vi&s;count Barrington, his Ma|je&s;ty's Secretary at war; a&s;&s;uring his Lord&s;hip, that al|though he had renounced his half-pay, yet, whenever it &s;hould plea&s;e his Maje&s;ty to call him forth to any honour|ble &s;ervice again&s;t the natural hereditary enemies of his country, or in defence of his mo&s;t ju&s;t rights and digni|ty, no man would obey the righteous &s;ummons with more zeal and alacrity than him&s;elf: at the &s;ame time, the General expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;approbation of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, in the mo&s;t direct terms; declaring them to be "&s;o ab&s;olutely &s;ubver&s;ive of the rights and liberties of every individual &s;ubject, &s;o de&s;tructive to the whole empire at large, and ultimately &s;o ruinous to his Maje&s;|ty's own per&s;on, dignity, and family, that he thought him&s;elf obliged in con&s;cience, as a citizen, Engli&s;hman; and a &s;oldier of a free State, to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t his utmo&s;t in de|feat them."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024456_0015_0FC734A498A55F38">Profe&s;&s;ing the&s;e &s;entiments, he received a Continental commi&s;&s;ion of the rank of Major General. As he had made war his &s;tudy from his youth, &s;een a variety of &s;er|vice, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for his courage and abilities, one might have imagined he would have immediately been appointed &s;econd in command in the American ar|my: this was not the ca&s;e; in all countries, ki&s;&s;ing goes by favour; and men will be tenacious of any rank be|&s;towed upon them. General Ward, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, by &s;ome means or other, had received a commi&s;&s;ion of prior date; and on this account, perhaps to the inju|ry of the &s;ervice, he took rank of General Lee, who was at pre&s;ent content to act under him. Whatever his feelings were on this head, he took care to di&s;gui&s;e them; and General Ward, on the evacuation of Bo&s;ton, grew weary or military honour and &s;ervice, retired to private life, and &s;ent his re&s;ignation to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of June, General Wa&s;hington and Ge|neral Lee, having received their orders from Congre&s;s, left Philadelphia, in order to join the troops a&s;&s;embled near Bo&s;ton. They were accompanied out of the city, for &s;ome miles, by a troop of light hor&s;e, and by all the officers of the city militia, on hor&s;eback; and at this time General Lee was accounted, and really was, a great ac|qui&s;ition to the American cau&s;e. On the road they re|ceived the news of the affair at Bunker's-hill, and arrived at the camp at Cambridge the 2d of July 1775. The people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts received them with every te&s;ti|mony of e&s;teem; and the Congre&s;s of that Colony not only pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his Excellency General Wa&s;hington, as commander in chief, but, from a &s;en&s;e of the military abilities of General Lee, pre&s;ented one to him al&s;o, couched in terms of the highe&s;t re&s;pect. The General remained with this army till the year 1776, when General Wa&s;hington, having obtained intelligence of the fitting out of a fleet at Bo&s;ton, and of the embark|ation of troops from thence, which, from the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and other circum&s;tances, he judged mu&s;t be de&s;tined for a Southern expedition, gave orders to Ge|neral

Lee, to repair, with &s;uch volunteers as were willing to join him, and could be expeditiou&s;ly rai&s;ed, to the city of New-York, with a de&s;ign to prevent the Engli&s;h from taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New-York and the North-River, as they would thereby command the country, and the com|munication with Canada. The General, on his arrival, began with putting the city in the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence the &s;ea&s;on of the year and circum&s;tances would admit of; di&s;arming all &s;uch per&s;ons upon Long-I&s;land, and el&s;e|where, who&s;e conduct and declarations had rendered them &s;u&s;pected of de&s;igns unfriendly to the views of Congre&s;s. Colonel Ward was ordered to &s;ecure the whole body of profe&s;&s;ed Tories in Long-I&s;land. This gave an univer&s;al alarm, that even the Congre&s;s of New-York endeavoured to check the General in this bu&s;ine&s;s, by informing him, in a letter, that the trial and puni&s;h|ment of citizens belonged to the Provincial Congre&s;s, and not to any military character, however exalted. To this the General an&s;wered, that when the enemy was at the doors, forms mu&s;t be di&s;pen&s;ed with&mdash;that his duty to them, to the Continental Congre&s;s, and to his own con&s;cience, had dictated the nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure&mdash; that if he had done wrong, he would &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the &s;hame of being reputed ra&s;h and precipitate, and undergo the cen&s;ure of the public; but he &s;hould have the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own brea&s;t, that the pure motives of &s;erving the community, uncontaminated by pique or re&s;entment to individuals, urged him to the &s;tep. The General al&s;o remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;upplying th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> men of war and Governor Tryon with provi&s;ions, as the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ats coming to the city mu&s;t open the means of their receiving every &s;ort of intelligence. "I &s;hould," &s;ays the General in one of his letters, "be in the highe&s;t degree culpable to God, my con&s;cience, and the Continental Congre&s;s, in who&s;e &s;ervice I am engaged, &s;hould I &s;uffer, at &s;o dan|gerous a cri&s;is, a banditti of profe&s;&s;ed foes of liberty and their country to remain at liberty to co-operate with, and &s;trengthen the mini&s;terial troops openly in arms, or covertly, and con&s;equently more dangerou&s;ly furni&s;h them

with intelligence." He al&s;o drew up a <HI>Te&s;t,</HI> which he ordered his officers to offer to tho&s;e who were reputed inimical to the American cau&s;e: a refu&s;al to take this, was to be con&s;trued as no more or le&s;s than an avowal of their ho&s;tile intentions: upon which, their per&s;ons were to be &s;ecured, and &s;ent to Connecticut, were it was judged they could not be &s;o dangerous. Thus the Gene|ral excited the people to every &s;pirited mea&s;ure, and inti|midated by every means the friends to the Engli&s;h go|vernment. At this time, Captain Vandeput, of the A&s;ia, &s;eized a Lieutenant Tiley, and kept him on board his &s;hip in irons. On the principles of retaliation, Lee took into cu&s;tody Mr. Stephens, an officer of Government, and informed the Captain what he had done, and that this gentleman &s;hould not be relea&s;ed until Lieut. Tiley was returned. This had the de&s;ired effect. His determi|ned and deci&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition had an amazing influence both on the army and people; and the &s;teps he propo&s;ed for the management of tho&s;e who di&s;approved of the A|merican re&s;i&s;tance, &s;truck a terror wherever he appeared.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s had now received the account of General Montgomery's un&s;ucce&s;sful expedition again&s;t Quebec. As flattering expectations were entertained of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of this officer, the event threw a gloom on American affairs. To remedy this di&s;a&s;ter, they turned their eyes to General Lee, and Congre&s;s re&s;olved that he &s;hould forthwith repair to Canada, and take upon him the com|mand of the army of the United Colonies in that pro|vince. This, though he was ju&s;t recovered from a fit of the gout, he accepted; but while preparations were making for the important undertaking, Congre&s;s changed their determination, and appointed him to the command of the Southern department; in which he became very con&s;picuous, as a vigilant, brave and active officer. His exten&s;ive corre&s;pondence, his addre&s;s under every diffi|culty, and his unwearied attention to the duties of his &s;tation, all evinced his great military capacity, and ex|treme u&s;eful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s to the cau&s;e he had e&s;pou&s;ed, and was warmly engaged in&mdash;Every te&s;timony of re&s;pect was paid
<PB N="11" REF="024456_0018_0FC734AC0B44B078">
him by the people of the Northern Colonies, and he ex|perienced a &s;imilar treatment in his journey to the South|ward. On his arrival at William&s;burgh, every one ex|pre&s;&s;ed their high &s;atisfaction at his pre&s;ence among them; and the troops of that city embraced the opportu|nity of pre&s;enting him with an addre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ive of their &s;anguine hopes and firm re&s;olutions of uniting with him in the common cau&s;e. This example was followed at Newbern, North-Carolina; and a committee was ap|pointed by the inhabitants of that town, to wait upon him in their name, and, in an addre&s;s, to thank him for his generous and manly exertions in defence of Ameri|can rights and liberties; and to offer him their cordial congratulations for his appearance among them, at a time when their province was actually invaded by a powerful fleet and army; and to expre&s;s their happine&s;s to find the command of the troops de&s;tined for their protection, placed in the hands of a gentleman of his di&s;tingui&s;hed character.</P>
<P>Great too was the joy in South Carolina, were his pre&s;ence was &s;ea&s;onable and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as Sir Henry Clinton was actually preparing for an inva&s;ion of that province. The minds of all ranks of people were con&s;iderably elevated at the &s;ight of him; it diffu&s;ed an ardour among the military, attended with the mo&s;t &s;alutary con&s;equences; and his diligence and activity at Charle&s;ton, previous to the attack upon Sullivan's i&s;land, will be long remembered. From a peru&s;al of his letters and directions to the officers commanding at that po&s;t, we may ju&s;tly infer, that America was under no &s;mall obligations to him for the &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s there obtained.&mdash;And here it may be mentioned, as &s;omewhat remarkable, that when General Lee received orders, at Cambridge, to repair to New-York, to watch the motions of the Briti&s;h, he met General Clinton the very day he arrived there;&mdash;when he came to Virginia, he found him in Hampton Road&mdash;and ju&s;t after his ar|rival in North Carolina, General Clinton left Cape Fear &mdash;Their next meeting was at Fort Sullivan, which mu&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="024456_0019_0FC734B20FF714F8">
have made Lee appear to Clinton as his evil genius, haunting him for more than eleven hundred miles, along a coa&s;t of va&s;t extent, and meeting him at Philippi.</P>
<P>The affair of Sullivan's i&s;land was a mo&s;t extraordina|ry deliverance; for if the Engli&s;h had &s;ucceeded, it is more than probable the Southern Colonies would at that time have been compelled to have &s;ubmitted to the Engli&s;h government. Dreadful was the cannonade, but without effect. Porto Bello, Boccochico, and the other ca&s;tle at Carthagena, were obliged to &s;trike to Ver|non; Fort Lewis in Saint Domingo yielded to the me|tal of Admiral Knowles; but in this in&s;tance, an unfi|ni&s;hed battery, con&s;tructed with Palmeto logs, re&s;i&s;ted, for a whole day, the twelve and eighteen-pounders of the Briti&s;h fleet, to the a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration of every &s;pectator.</P>
<P>The fleet and army under Sir Henry Clinton and Sir Peter Parker being repul&s;ed, General Lee then flew to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Georgia, where he continued for &s;ome weeks, planning &s;chemes to put that province in a &s;tate of defence, and to make an excur&s;ion into Ea&s;t Florida, as their Southern frontiers were &s;uffering con&s;iderably by the incur&s;ions of Indians and others from that quarter.</P>
<P>About this time, the Congre&s;s were informed by Ge|neral Wa&s;hington, that Clinton, with the troops under his command, had returned, and joined General Howe at Staten-i&s;land. In con&s;equence of this intelligence, the Congre&s;s were convinced that the Engli&s;h, by collec|ting their whole force into a point, were determined to make a mo&s;t vigorous exertion at New-York; and in order to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s there, were di&s;po&s;ed for the pre|&s;ent to overlook every other object. The getting po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of that city, and the junction of the two armies un|der General Howe and Burgoyne, it was the Congre&s;s's opinion, were the grand objects they had in view, and for the attainment of which they would give up every inferior con&s;ideration. Lee's &s;ucce&s;s in the Southern department had increa&s;ed the good opinion they had con|ceived of him: his reputation was in its zenith; and
<PB N="13" REF="024456_0020_0FC734B3ACFA9278">
they now applied to him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the pre&s;ent important &s;ituation of their affairs. An expre&s;s was di&s;|patched to Georgia, directing him to repair as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to Philadelphia, there to receive &s;uch orders as they might judge expedient. He returned with great expedition, the beginning of October, and waited on Congre&s;s immediately on his arrival, who, after con&s;ult|ing him, re&s;olved that he &s;hould without delay repair to the camp at Haerlem, with leave, if he &s;hould judge proper, to vi&s;it the po&s;ts in New-Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>He arrived at General Wa&s;hington's army ju&s;t time enough to prevent it from being blockaded in York-i&s;land, the circum&s;tance of which had been thus related. General Wa&s;hington was at that time under a nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;ulting his council of officers, before he could take any &s;tep of con&s;equence; and they, contrary to his opi|nion, were for waiting an attack in their own lines on York-i&s;land&mdash;Exten&s;ive barracks had been erected, and large preparations made for &s;uch a &s;tep. Sir William Howe, finding the Americans too &s;trong to be attacked with &s;afety from the &s;ide of New-York, leaving Lord Piercy with a body of troops oppo&s;ite the river, embark|ed the re&s;t in his flat boats, pa&s;&s;ed &s;afely the dangerous pa&s;&s;age of Hell-Gate, and landed on Frog's Neck, an i&s;land &s;eparated by a &s;mall creek from We&s;t Che&s;ter. Here he remained a week, under a pretence of waiting for &s;tores and provi&s;ions; while the Americans, in con&s;equence of their re&s;olutions, continued on the I&s;|land. The very evening before General Howe made a movement, General Lee arrived at General Wa&s;hing|ton's camp; <HI>his opinion</HI> of their dangerous &s;ituation con|vinced the council of war; and, that night, a precipitate movement extricated them from the danger. The next morning, General Howe landed on Pell's Manor, a point &s;eparated from Frog's Neck by a channel of &s;carce 200 yards: he then extended his army acro&s;s to Hud&s;on's-river; but there was then no enemy to intercept. Had he, in&s;tead of trifling away his time, crammed up on Frog's Neck, landed only on Pell's Point, not a &s;oul of
<PB N="14" REF="024456_0021_0FC734B5B95D8048">
the American army would have e&s;caped. Hitherto Ge|neral Lee had been &s;ucce&s;sful, and was univer&s;ally e&s;teem|ed; but fortune now began to rever&s;e the &s;cene. On the 13th of December 1776, at the head of all the men he could collect, he was marching to join General Wa&s;hington, who had a&s;&s;embled the Penn&s;ylvania militia, to &s;ecure the banks of the Delaware.&mdash;From the di&s;tance of the Briti&s;h cantonment, he was betrayed into a fatal &s;ecurity, by which, in cro&s;&s;ing the upper part of New-Jer&s;ey from the North river, he fixed his quarters, and by carele&s;sly guarded at &s;ome di&s;tance from the main body. This circum&s;tance being communicated to Colonel Har|court, who commanded the Briti&s;h light hor&s;e, and had then made a de&s;ultory excur&s;ion at the head of a &s;mall detachment, he conducted his mea&s;ures with &s;uch addre&s;s and activity, that Lee was carried off, though &s;everal guarded po&s;ts and armed patroles lay in the way. Great was the joy of the Briti&s;h, and equal the con&s;ternation of the Americans, at this unexpected event. The mak|ing of a &s;ingle officer pri&s;oner, in other circum&s;tances, would have been a matter of little moment; but in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the continental forces, where a general deficiency of the military &s;kill prevailed, and the inex|perience of the officers was even a greater grievance, the lo&s;s of a commander who&s;e &s;pirit of enterprize was di|rected by great knowledge in his profe&s;&s;ion, acquire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by actual &s;ervice, was indeed of the utmo&s;t importance. The Congre&s;s, on hearing this news, ordered their Pre&s;i|dent to write to General Wa&s;hington, de&s;iring him to &s;end a flag to General Howe, for the purpo&s;e of enquiring in what manner General Lee was treated; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he found that it was not agreeable to his rank an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> character, to &s;end a remon&s;trance to General Howe o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ubject. This produced much inconvenience to bot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ides, and much calamity to individuals. A cartel had &s;ome time before been e&s;tabli&s;hed for the exchange o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pri&s;oners between the Generals Howe and Wa&s;hington <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which had hitherto been carried into execution as far a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> time and circum&s;tances would admit. As Lee wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="15" REF="024456_0022_0FC734B8C17E7628">
particularly obnoxious to Government, it was &s;aid that General Howe was tied down by his in&s;tructions, from parting with him upon any terms, if the fortune of war &s;hould throw him into his power. General Wa&s;hington not having at this time any pri&s;oners of equal rank with Lee, propo&s;ed to exchange &s;ix field officers for him, the number being intended to balance that di&s;parity; or if this was not accepted, he required that he &s;hould be treated &s;uitably to his &s;tation, according to the practice e&s;tabli&s;hed among poli&s;hed nations, till an opportunity offered for a direct and equal exchange. To this it was an&s;wered, that as Mr. Lee was a de&s;erter from his Maje&s;ty's &s;er|vice, he was not to be con&s;idered as a pri&s;oner of war; that he did not at all come within the conditions of the cartel, nor could he receive any of its benefits. This brought on a fruitle&s;s di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, whether General Lee, who had re&s;igned his half-pay at the beginning of the troubles, could be con&s;idered as a de&s;erter; or whether he could with ju&s;tice be excluded from the general bene|fits of a cartel, in which no particular exception of per|&s;on had been made. In the mean time, General Lee was guarded with all the &s;trictne&s;s which a State crimi|nal of the fir&s;t magnitude could have experienced in the mo&s;t dangerous political conjuncture. This conduct not only &s;u&s;pended the operation of the cartel, but induced retaliation on the American &s;ide; and Colonel Campbell, who had hitherto been treated with great humanity by the people of Bo&s;ton, was now thrown into a dungeon.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Briti&s;h officers who were pri&s;oners in the South|ern Colonies, though not treated with equal rigour, were, however, abridged of their parole liberty. It was at the &s;ame time declared, that their future treatment &s;hould in every degree be regulated by that which General Lee ex|perienced, and that their per&s;ons &s;hould be an&s;werable, in the utmo&s;t extent, for any violence that was offered to him. Thus m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tters continued till the capture of the Briti&s;h army under General Burgoyne at Saratoga, Oc|tober 17th, 1777. A change of conduct towards him then took place; he was allowed his parole in New-York,

lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e with Lieutenant Colo|nel Butler of the 38th, dined with General Robert&s;on commandant of the town, and with many principal of|ficers and families, and a &s;hort time after was exchanged.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t military &s;cene in which General Lee ap|peared after his liberation, was the battle of Monmouth, which determined his career in the American army. Before this affair, his character in general was very re|&s;pectable; many of the warm friends of America, high|ly valued the important &s;ervices he had rendered to the United States.</P>
<P>From the beginning of the conte&s;t, he had excited and directed the military &s;pirit which pervaded the con|tinent; his conver&s;ation rai&s;ed an emulation among the officers, and he taught them to pay a proper attention to the health, cloathing, and comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their men: add to this, his zeal was unwearied in incul|cating the principles of liberty among all ranks of peo|ple; hence it is &s;aid, that a &s;trong party was formed in Congre&s;s, and by &s;ome di&s;contented officers in the army, to rai&s;e Lee to the fir&s;t command; and it hath been &s;ug|ge&s;ted by many, that General Lee's conduct at the bat|tle of Monmouth, was intended to effect this plan; for, could the odium of the defeat have been at that time thrown on General Wa&s;hington, and his attack of the Briti&s;h army made to appear ra&s;h and imprudent, there is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e he would have been deprived of his command. It hath been ob&s;erved by &s;ome wri|ters on this &s;ubject, that when General Lee was taken pri&s;oner, the American army was on no par with the Royal forces; but the ca&s;e was much changed on his return from his captivity. He found them improved, and daring enough to attack even the Briti&s;h grenadiers with firmne&s;s and re&s;olution. Had not this been the ca&s;e, and General Lee, when ordered to attack the rear of the Royal army, &s;een his men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> back with di&s;|grace, unwilling to rally, and acting with fear and tre|pidation, his retreat would have been nece&s;&s;ary, his con|duct crowned with applau&s;e, and his purpo&s;es effected;

<P>The Briti&s;h army, early on Thur&s;day the 25th of June, compleated their evacuation of Philadelphia, ha|ving before tran&s;ported their &s;tores and mo&s;t of their ar|tillery into the Jer&s;ies, where they had thrown up &s;ome works, and &s;everal regiments were encamped;&mdash;they manned the lines the preceding night, and retreated over the commons, cro&s;&s;ing at Glouce&s;ter Point. A party of the American hor&s;e pur&s;ued them very clo&s;e; how|ever nothing very material happened till the 28th, when, about three o'clock in the morning, the Briti&s;h army moved on their way to Middletown Point. About eleven o'clock, the American van, commanded by General Lee, overtook them; but he &s;oon retreated, and was met by General Wa&s;hington, who formed on the fir&s;t proper piece of ground near Monmouth Court-Hou&s;e. While this was doing, two pieces of cannon, &s;upported by Co|lonel Living&s;ton and Colonel Stewart, with a picked corps of 300 men, kept off the main body of the En|gli&s;h, and made a great &s;laughter. Very &s;evere &s;kirmi&s;h|ing en&s;ued; and the American army advancing, the Briti&s;h made their la&s;t efforts upon a &s;mall body of Penn|&s;ylvania troops at and about Mr. Tennant's hou&s;e; they then gave way, leaving the field covered with dead and wounded. General Wa&s;hington's troops pur&s;ued for about a mile, when, night coming on, and the men ex|ceedingly fatigued with marching, and the hot weather, they halted about half a mile beyond the ground of the principal action.&mdash;The Briti&s;h took a &s;trong po&s;t in their front, &s;ecured on both flanks by mora&s;&s;es and thick woods, where they remained until about twelve at night, and then retreated.

<P>FROM the knowledge I have of your Excellency's character, I mu&s;t conclude, that nothing but the mi&s;in|formation of &s;ome very &s;tupid, or mi&s;repre&s;entation of &s;ome very wicked per&s;on, could have occa&s;ioned your making u&s;e of &s;uch very &s;ingular expre&s;&s;ions as you did, on my coming up to the ground where you had taken po&s;t: they implied, that I was guilty either of di&s;obedi|ence of orders, want of conduct, or want of courage. Your excellency will therefore infinitely oblige me, by letting me know, on which of the&s;e three articles you ground your charge, that I may prepare for my ju&s;tifica|tion; which I have the happine&s;s to be confident I can do, to the Army, to the Congre&s;s, to America, and to the World in general. Your Excellency mu&s;t give me leave to ob&s;erve, that neither your&s;elf, nor tho&s;e about your per&s;on, could, from your &s;ituation, be in the lea&s;t judges of the merits or demerits of our manoeuvres; and to &s;peak with a becoming pride, I can a&s;&s;ert, that to the&s;e manoeuvres the &s;ucce&s;s of the day was entirely owing. I can boldly &s;ay, that had we remained on the fir&s;t ground, or had we advanced, or had the retreat been conducted in a manner different from what it was, this whole ar|my, and the intere&s;ts of America, would have ri&s;ked be|ing &s;acrificed. I ever had, and I hope ever &s;hall have, the greate&s;t re&s;pect and veneration for General Wa&s;h|ington; I think him endued with many great and good qualities: But in this in&s;tance, I mu&s;t pronounce, that he has been guilty of an act of cruel inju&s;tice, towards a man who had certainly &s;ome preten&s;ions to the regard

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing my letter by Colonel Fitzgerald to your Excellency, I have reflected on both your &s;ituation and mine; and beg leave to ob|&s;erve, that it will be for our mutual convenience, that a Court of Inquiry &s;hould be immediately ordered; but I could wi&s;h it might be a Court Martial: for, if the affair

<P>THE Court met, by &s;everal adjournments, till the 12th of Augu&s;t, when they found the unfortunate Ge|neral guilty of the &s;everal charges brought again&s;t him, and &s;entenced him to be &s;u&s;pended from any commi&s;&s;ion in the armies of the United States of North America for the term of twelve months. But it was u&s;ual in A|merica, and thought nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;entence of every Court Martial &s;hould be ratified or confirmed by Con|gre&s;s; the proceedings, therefore, of the Court, were accordingly tran&s;mitted to them, and the General re|paired to Philadelphia to await their deci&s;ion.

<P>THE different commentators on the orders I received from General Wa&s;hington, on the 28th of June, have, I think, con&s;trued them into no more than three differ|ent &s;en&s;es. I &s;hall, therefore, for argument's &s;ake, give the world leave to &s;uppo&s;e them to have been any one of the&s;e three:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t appear &s;omewhat extraordinary, that when the principal and heavie&s;t charge brought again&s;t me, was the di&s;obedience of orders, the&s;e orders, that it &s;eems I di&s;obeyed, &s;hould never have been attempt|ed to be a&s;certained to the Court by the proper authority, but were left to the conjecture and wild con&s;tructions of tho&s;e who might take the trouble to gue&s;s, and to the hardine&s;s of tho&s;e who might chu&s;e to invent.</NOTE>&mdash;1&s;t. To attack the enemy in whatever &s;ituation, and in whatever force I found them, without con&s;idering con&s;equences.</P>
<P N="2">2. To contrive the means of bringing on a general engagement.</P>
<P N="3">3. To annoy them as much as po&s;&s;ible, without ri&s;k|ing any thing of great importance; that is, in fact, to act with a great degree of latitude, according to my own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Now, I &s;ay, granting any one of tho&s;e three to have been the orders I received, it is manife&s;t, that I did li|terally and effectually comply, as far as depended on my&s;elf, and on human means. As to the fir&s;t, not|with&s;tanding the attempt, by a low eva&s;ion, to prove that the orders I gave were only to <HI>advance</HI> on the ene|my, it is clear from Captain Mercer's evidence, that General Wayne and Colonel Butler were ordered, not only to advance, but in preci&s;e terms to attack;&mdash;it is clear, that I did, with the three brigadiers on the right, make the only movement po&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h this end; it is clear that I did not wi&s;h, or give any orders for a retrograde manoeuvre from the fir&s;t point of action, and that, even when I was informed of our left being abandoned, the retreat, however nece&s;&s;ary, was, I am a&s;hamed to own it, done contrary to my orders, and contrary to my intentions. I &s;ay I am a&s;hamed to own it; for if the Briti&s;h cavalry had vigorou&s;ly pu&s;hed on
<PB N="23" REF="024456_0030_0FC734D17900CDD0">
our right, they might have turned our flank, taken us in rever&s;e, and we had been lo&s;t. There is one &s;uppo&s;iti|on, and indeed only one (and that, for the General's ho|nour, is too mon&s;trous to be admitted) that would ren|der me criminal; it is, that he had po&s;itively command|ed me, that after the attack commenced, whatever were my circum&s;tances, or whatever were my numbers, from thence I &s;hould not, from any con&s;ideration, recede an inch. Now, if &s;uch I had conceived to have been his intention, &s;o great is my opinion of the valour, zeal, and obedience of the troops, and &s;o well I think I know my|&s;elf, that I do really believe we &s;hould all have peri&s;hed on the fir&s;t &s;pot; but I never had, and it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould have an idea that &s;uch was his plan; and it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dent that it was not; con&s;equently, in &s;eeking a bett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n in our rear, I could be guilty of no di&s;|obedience&punc; Upon the whole, admitting the orders I re|ceived to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> (as it has been in&s;inuated) to attack, without any con&s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ration of the force or &s;ituation of the enemy, they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re as fully and rigidly obeyed, circum&s;tan|ced as I was, as it was po&s;&s;ible for any human officer to obey orders of &s;uch a nature, In the next place, if the General's in&s;tructions are con&s;trued to be, that I &s;hould find the means of bringing on a general engagement, it is difficult to imagine a more efficacious method than that which was pur&s;ued. But I mu&s;t here beg leave to ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e gentlemen who talk &s;o familiarly of bringing on a general engagement, mu&s;t under&s;tand them&s;elves as little as they can be under&s;tood by others: &mdash;to bring on a general engagement, is not always in our power. An enemy of any capacity will take &s;uch mea&s;ures as not to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of fighting again&s;t his inclinations; and, however it may be re|ceived, I cannot help being per&s;uaded, that &s;ome of the Briti&s;h generals are not deficient in this great e&s;|&s;ential. Clinton, Grey, and Er&s;kine, were bred up, and con&s;idered no de&s;picable officers in one of the be&s;t &s;chools in Europe. Prince Ferdinand and his nephew, the he|riditary prince, think, it is &s;aid, and do mo&s;t certainly
<PB N="24" REF="024456_0031_0FC734D81751F0B0">
&s;peak very honourably of them. Now, although it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that men of this &s;tamp will make it a rule to retain the power of refu&s;ing a general engagement, there are &s;trong grounds for believing, that on this day (whether from our manoeuvres, or from the often un|governable impetuo&s;ity of the Briti&s;h troops) they would have been put under the nece&s;&s;ity of committing the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of their army to the deci&s;ion of arms, if the opportunity on our &s;ide had been availed of. They were tempted to pa&s;s three of the great ravines winch traver&s;e the plain; and there is room to flatter our&s;elves they would have pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t, if they had been wi&s;ely &s;uffered. They would then have been actually in our power; that is, they would have been under the nece&s;|&s;ity of fighting again&s;t unequal force; for they had &s;carce|ly the po&s;&s;ibility of retreating, and it was at our option to engage whatever part of the army we thought proper, whether the whole, one half, or only a third, as they had immediately emerged from the ravine, and before they could have had time to develop and form; our rear was, on the contrary, quite clear and unembarra&s;&s;ed, and were, in fact, entire ma&s;ters of our manoeuvres; at the &s;ame time, Colonel Morgan, and the militia on the flanks, by this &s;eparation of the major part of the ene|my's army to &s;o great a di&s;tance from their baggage, and the body covering the baggage, would have had a much fairer apportunity of making their re&s;pective attacks, than if they had remained more compact: thus, if any thing is meant by finding the means of bringing on a general engagement, it was done, and in the mo&s;t &s;alu|tary manner, to the utmo&s;t extent of human po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>We come now to the la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, viz. That the orders I received (which in fact is the truth, unle&s;s they they had no meaning at all) were to annoy the enemy, &s;trike a partial blow, but without ri&s;king any thing of great importance; or in other terms, to act in a great mea&s;ure di&s;cretionally.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be remarked, that di&s;obedience to di&s;cretionary orders is, <HI>prima facie,</HI> a glaring ab&s;urdity; it is an impo&s;&s;ibility; and yet it has been endeavoured to prove me guilty of this impo&s;&s;ibility,</NOTE> And here I defy the mo&s;t acute

military critic of the world, to point out a more effectual method than what was pur&s;ued; for, had we taken po&s;t on the hither or we&s;tern margin of the fir&s;t ravine, as General Wayne &s;eems to think we ought to have done, (and admitting that in this po&s;ition our flanks could have been &s;ecure, which they certainly were not) or on the margin of any of the other ravines in our rear, the la&s;t not excepted, if the la&s;t had been tenable, how could we po&s;&s;ibly have annoyed the enemy, or &s;truck a partial blow? The con&s;equence would at mo&s;t have been this, that we might have remained gazing on and cannonad|ing each other for &s;ome time, and the moment they cho&s;e to retire, they could have done it at their lei&s;ure, and with impunity; for, by all the rules of war, and what is more, by all the rules of common &s;en&s;e, we could not have ventured to pur&s;ue them, becau&s;e we &s;hould have put, if not impracticable, at lea&s;t very dan|gerous, defiles in our rear; and if they had turned back upon us, we &s;hould have been effectually in their power, unle&s;s we could have in&s;ured victory to our&s;elves with very unequal numbers; but by drawing them over all the ravines, they were as much in our power; be&s;ides, it mu&s;t occur to every man who is not de&s;titute of com|mon rea&s;on, that the further they were from their &s;hips and the heights of Middletown, the point of their &s;ecu|rity, the more they were (to u&s;e the military language) in the air.</P>
<P>To the&s;e con&s;iderations may be added, that the ground we found them on, was extremely favourable to the na|ture of their troops; and that we drew them into, as fa|vourable to ours. The ground we found them on, was calculated for cavalry, in which they comparatively abounded; and that which we drew them into, as much the rever&s;e. In fine, admitting that the order I received was any one of the three referred to, and &s;uppo&s;ing we had been as perfectly acquainted with every yard of the country as we were utterly ignorant of it, I am happy to be able con&s;ciou&s;ly to pronounce, that were the tran&s;ac|tions of that day to pa&s;s over again, there is no one &s;tep

I have already &s;aid, that had we remained on the ground where the attack commenced, or on the margin of the fir&s;t ravine, which General Wayne &s;eems to think was a good po&s;ition, we &s;hould probably have been lo&s;t; and I believe I may &s;afely a&s;&s;ert that had we attached our|&s;elves to the &s;econd po&s;ition, in front of Carr's hou&s;e, reconnoitred by Mon&s;.

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> A thou&s;and wicked and low artifices, during my tryal, were u&s;ed to render me unpopular. One of the principal was, to throw out that I had endeavoured, on every occa&s;ion, to depreciate the American valour, and the character of their troops. There never was a more impudent fal&s;ehood; I appeal to my letters addre&s;|&s;ed to Mr. Burgoyne&mdash;to the whole tenor of my con|ver&s;ation, both previous and &s;ub&s;equent to the com|mencement of the pre&s;ent war, and to all my publica|tions. It is true, I have often heavily lamented, as to me it appears, the defective con&s;titution of the army; but I have ever had the highe&s;t opinion of the courage and other good qualities of the Americans as &s;oldiers; and the proofs that my opinion was ju&s;t, are numerous and &s;ub&s;tantial.</P>
<P>To begin with the affair of Bunker's hill, I may ven|ture to pronounce that there never was a more danger|ous, a more execrable &s;ituation, than the&s;e brave and unfortunate men (if tho&s;e who die in the glorious cau&s;e of Liberty can be termed unfortunate) were placed in; they had to encounter with a body of troops, both in point of &s;pirit and di&s;cipline, not to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in the whole world, headed by an officer of experience, intre|pidity, coolne&s;s, and deci&s;ion. The Americans were compo&s;ed, in part, of raw lads and old men, half armed, with no practice or di&s;cipline, commanded without or|der, and God knows by whom. Yet what was the event? It is known to the world, that the Briti&s;h troops, notwith&s;tanding their addre&s;s and gallantry, were mo&s;t &s;everely handled, and almo&s;t defeated.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Colonels Stark, Pre&s;cot, Little, Gardner, Read, Nixon, and the two Brewers, were entitled to immortal honour for their action on that day; but, according to the u&s;ual ju&s;tice of the writers of news|papers and Gazettes, their names have &s;carcely been mentioned on this occa&s;ion.</NOTE></P>
<P>The troops under the command of General Montgo|mery, in his expedition again&s;t St. John's, Chambly, and into Canada, who were chiefly compo&s;ed of native Americans, as they were from the Ea&s;tern States, di&s;|played,

by his own account, in a letter I received from that illu&s;trious young man, not only great courage, but zeal and enterprize.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ault under Arnold, on the lower town of Que|bec, was an attempt that would have &s;tartled the mo&s;t approved veterans; and, if they mi&s;carried, it cannot be attributed to a deficiency of valour, but to want of pro|per information of the circum&s;tances of the place.</P>
<P>The defence of Sullivan's-I&s;land, by Colonel Moultrie, might be termed an ordeal. The garri&s;on, both men and officers, entirely raw; the fire furious, and of a du|ration almo&s;t beyond example; their &s;ituation extremely critical and dangerous, for the rear was in a manner open; and if General Clinton could, as it was expected, have landed on the i&s;land, there were no re&s;ources but in the la&s;t de&s;perate re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the tran&s;actions on York and Long-I&s;land, I mu&s;t be &s;ilent, as I am ignorant of them; but, from &s;ome ob&s;ervations after I joined the army, I have rea&s;on to think the fault could not have been in the men, or in the common bulk of officers.</P>
<P>Even the unhappy bu&s;ine&s;s of Fort Wa&s;hington, which was attended with &s;uch abominable con&s;equences, and which brought the affairs of America to the brink of ruin, when the circum&s;tances are well con&s;idered, did honour to the officers and men, devoted to the defence of this worthle&s;s and ridiculous favourite.</P>
<P>The defence of Red-Bank, by Colonel Green, and Mud-I&s;land, by Colonel Smith, forced a confe&s;&s;ion, even from the mo&s;t determined infidels on this point, of the Briti&s;h officers, to the honour of American valour. I have often heard them allow, that the defence of the&s;e two places <HI>were really hand&s;ome things&mdash;that no men could have done better;</HI> which, from unwilling mouths, is no &s;mall panegyric.</P>
<P>The victory gained by Stark, at Bennington, and the capture of Mr. Burgoyne's whole army, by Gates and Arnold, are, above all, convincing arguments of what
<PB N="30" REF="024456_0037_0FC734E902CB1298">
excellent ingredients, in all re&s;pects, the force of Ame|rica is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The detail of what pa&s;&s;ed lately on Rhode-I&s;land is not yet come to my knowledge; but, from all I have been able to collect, the men and officers exhibited great valour and facility, as did their General, di&s;cretion, calm|ne&s;s, and good conduct. Upon the whole, I am war|ranted to &s;ay, what I always thought, that no di&s;grace or calamity has fallen on the arms of America through the whole cour&s;e of the war, but what mu&s;t be attribu|ted to &s;ome other cau&s;e than to the want of valour, of di&s;po&s;ition to obedience, or to any other military defect in the men, or the general ma&s;s of their officers in their different ranks; and I &s;olemnly declare, that was it at my choice to &s;elect from all the nations of the earth to form an excellent and perfect army, I would, without he&s;itation, give the preference to the Americans. By publi&s;hing this opinion, I cannot incur the &s;u&s;picion of paying my court to their vanity, as it is notoriou&s;ly the language I have ever held.</P>
<P>I have been told, that one of the crimes imputed to me, is by entertaining a high opinion of the Briti&s;h troops. If this is a crime, I am ready to acknowledge it. There were times, I confe&s;s, when the promulgation of &s;uch an opinion would have been impolitic, and even criminal; but in the&s;e times, it is notorious to the world that my conduct was the rever&s;e. Every thing I wrote, every thing I &s;aid, tended to in&s;pire that confidence in their own &s;trength, which it was thought the Americans wanted; and it is believed, that what I &s;aid, and what I wrote, had no incon&s;iderable effect; but now, circum|&s;tanced as we are, I cannot conceive the danger, or even impropriety, in &s;peaking of them as they de&s;erve, parti|cularly as their excellence redounds to the honour of America. I could not help, whil&s;t I was pri&s;oner, be|ing a&s;toni&s;hed at the bad policy and &s;tupidity of &s;ome of the Briti&s;h officers, who made it their con&s;tant bu&s;ine&s;s to depreciate the character of the Americans in point of courage and &s;en&s;e.

making a very natural ob&s;ervation to them, that if the per&s;ua&s;ion of their opponent's cowardice and folly were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world, the great merits they them&s;elves pretended to mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, be ut|terly de&s;troyed.

This is a truth, &s;imple and clear as the day; but be it as it will, it is now mo&s;t certain, let the courage and di&s;cipline of the Briti&s;h troops be as great as imagi|nation can paint, there is at pre&s;ent no danger from ei|ther the one or the other. The dangers that now threat|en, are from other quarters; from the want of temper, moderation, oeconomy, wi&s;dom, and deci&s;ion among&s;t our&s;elves; from a childi&s;h credulity; and, in con&s;e|quence of it, a promptne&s;s to commit acts of the highe&s;t inju&s;tice on tho&s;e who have de&s;erved be&s;t at the hands of the community; but above all, from the direct op|po&s;ites to tho&s;e qualities, virtues, and principles, with|out which it is impo&s;&s;ible that the mode of government e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;hould be &s;upported for the tenth part of a century.

<P><PB N="32" REF="024456_0039_0FC734EC81DB8660">IT was a con&s;iderable time before Congre&s;s took the General's trial under their con&s;ideration, during which our unfortunate hero continued &s;marting under the frowns of fortune and the malignant tongues of men; and to add to his &s;ufferings in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, he received a letter from Colonel Laurens, one of General Wa&s;hington's aids, informing him, "that, in contempt of decency and truth, he had publicly abu&s;ed General Wa&s;hington in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms;" that, "the relation in which he &s;tood to him, forbade him to pa&s;s &s;uch con|duct unnoticed; he therefore demanded the &s;atisfaction which he was entitled to; and de&s;ired, that as &s;oon as General Lee &s;hould think him&s;elf at liberty, he would appoint time and place, and name his weapons." With|out he&s;itation this was accepted; and the General made choice of a brace of pi&s;tols, declining the &s;mall &s;word, becau&s;e he was rather in a weak &s;tate of body, having lately received a fall from a hor&s;e, and al&s;o taken a quan|tity of medicine to baffle a fit of the gout, which he ap|prehended. They met according to appointment, and di&s;charged their pi&s;tols, when General Lee received a &s;light wound in his &s;ide; and it hath been &s;aid, that on this occa&s;ion, he di&s;played the greate&s;t fortitude and courage.</P>
<P>Shortly after, the proceedings of the Court Martial on his trial came under con&s;ideration in Congre&s;s, and pro|duced debates for &s;everal evenings; but, finally, the &s;en|tence was confirmed. The General was much di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied with it, and his mind extremely embittered again&s;t one of the members, Mr. William Henry Drayton, of South Carolina. This gentleman's conduct was vitupe|rated by Lee in the &s;evere&s;t language, becau&s;e he oppo|&s;ed in Congre&s;s a divi&s;ion of the &s;everal charges brought again&s;t him, but argued and in&s;i&s;ted upon lumping them all together, to be decided by one que&s;tion. In this he was ingeniou&s;ly and warmly oppo&s;ed by a very amiable and worthy gentleman, Mr. William Paca, a late go|vernor of Maryland.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY colleague, Mr Hut&s;on, hath this day mentioned to me, a conver&s;ation you had with him, in which you expre&s;&s;ed your &s;elf as injured by a mi&s;repre&s;entation of your conduct immediately preceding your captivity by the enemy, in a charge I had the honour to deliver, as Chief Ju&s;tice, to the Grand Jury of Charle&s;ton, South Carolina.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t inform you, Sir, that, on the one hand, I have been repeatedly a&s;&s;ured the repre&s;entation I then made was a true one; and that, on the other hand, I have al&s;o been a&s;&s;ured, that it was not founded on fact; and that, immediately upon this latter a&s;&s;urance in South Caroli|na, I took that &s;tep which was mo&s;t likely to lead me to a certainty on the &s;ubject, with the avowed de&s;ign, that if I had injured your reputation, I might be enabled to make the mo&s;t ample reparation; but I did not receive the nece&s;&s;ary materials. Tho&s;e &s;entiments of propriety which dictated the fir&s;t advance on my part then, to ac|quire them now dictate a like conduct when another opportunity &s;eems to open it&s;elf for my arriving at truth, and to do that ju&s;tice which the ca&s;e may require. And I do a&s;&s;ure you, that if I can be enabled to declare, that you did not violate the orders of the commander in

<P>To this purpo&s;e, I wrote to Major Eu&s;tace on the 6th of January 1778, when I was in Charle&s;ton, and had no pro&s;pect of coming to this part of the Continent; and a copy of the corre&s;pondence between him and my&s;elf on the occa&s;ion I will lay before you, if you de&s;ire to &s;ee it.</P>

<P>I SHOULD have done my&s;elf the honour of an&s;wer|ing your letter ye&s;terday, but was prevented by a variety of bu&s;ine&s;s. If I have violated any orders of the com|mander in chief, to him, and the Congre&s;s only, am I re&s;pon&s;ible; but certainly am not amenable to the tribu|nal of Mr. William Henry Drayton. I &s;hall therefore remain entirely indifferent whether you are plea&s;ed to think or dream that I de&s;ignedly threw my&s;elf into the hands of the enemy, or whether I was not taken by 2 concurrence of unfortunate circum&s;tances, &s;uch as hap|pen in the cour&s;e of all wars. The only remark I &s;hall make on your extraordinary requi&s;ition, that I &s;hould clear my&s;elf on this point to you &s;imply, Mr. William Henry Drayton, whom I con&s;ider but as a mere com|mon member of Congre&s;s, is, that you pay a very ill com|pliment to the General. You mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him either mi&s;erably deficient in under&s;tanding, or in integrity as a

This ingenious &s;uppo&s;ition, there|fore, is, in my opinion, a greater affront to the General than to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am &s;incerely concerned that my friend Eu&s;tace &s;hould have degraded him&s;elf &s;o far as to enter into any di&s;cu&s;&s;i|on of this matter with Mr. William Henry Drayton; and I &s;hall reprimand him for not under&s;tanding his own dignity better, I &s;hall now only take the trouble of ad|ding, that if you can reconcile your conduct in &s;tepping out of the road (as I am informed you did in your charge to the grand jury) to aggravate the calamities of an un|happy man, who had &s;acrificed every thing to the cau&s;e of your country, and, as he then conceived, to the rights of mankind; who had &s;acrificed an ample, at lea&s;t an ea&s;y and independent fortune, the mo&s;t honourable connecti|ons, great military pretentions, his friends and relations&punc; I &s;ay if you can reconcile your &s;tepping out of the road to aggravate the calamities of a man who had notoriou&s;ly made the&s;e &s;acrifices, and who, at the very time you was di&s;playing your generous eloquence, had no le&s;s than five centinels on his per&s;on, and was &s;uffering extremely in body and mind&mdash;If you can, I repeat, reconcile &s;uch a procedure to common humanity, common &s;en&s;e, or common decency, you mu&s;t &s;till be a more &s;ingular per|&s;onage than the public at pre&s;ent con&s;ider you.</P>

<P><PB N="39" REF="024456_0046_0FC735039B9F6170">The only ground on which this in&s;inuation can be made, aro&s;e from the following circum&s;tance: In the fall, 1776, I was extremely anxious that Fort Wa&s;hing|ton &s;hould be evacuated; there was a difference in opi|nion among tho&s;e whom the General con&s;ulted, and he he&s;itated more than I ever knew him on any other occa&s;i|on, and more than I thought the public &s;ervice admitted. Knowing that General Lee's opinion would be a great &s;upport to mine, I wrote to him from Hackin&s;ack, &s;tat|ing the ca&s;e, and my rea&s;ons, and, I think, urging him to join me in &s;entiment at the clo&s;e of my letter; and, alluding to the particular &s;ubject then before me, to the be&s;t of my recollection, I added this &s;entence: "With a thou&s;and good and great qualities, there is a want of deci&s;ion to complete the perfect military character."</P>
<P>Upon this &s;entence, or one to this effect, wrote in ha&s;te, in full confidence, and in great anxiety for the event, is this ungenerous &s;entiment introduced into the world. The event but too fully ju&s;tified my anxiety; for the fort was &s;ummoned that very day, and &s;urren|dered the next. I ab&s;olutely deny that there is any other ground but this letter; and if there is, let it be produ|ced. I have now only to add, that though General Wa&s;hington &s;oon after&punc; by an accident, knew of this cir|cum&s;tance, it never le&s;&s;ened the friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed between us. He had too much greatne&s;s of mind to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf incapable of mi&s;takes, or to di&s;like a faithful friend, who &s;hould note an error with &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances of re&s;pect, and on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. I have &s;ince been with this great and good man, for &s;uch he is, at very critical moments; and I hope I &s;hall not be &s;u&s;|pected of unbecoming adulation, when I a&s;&s;ure my countrymen, (&s;o far as my opinion is thought of any con&s;equence) that they may repo&s;e them&s;elves in perfect confidence on his prudence and judgment, which are equal to any circum&s;tances;&mdash; and that repeated experi|ence of the value of his opinions, have in&s;pired him with more dependance on them than his mode&s;ty and diffidence would in &s;ome ca&s;es formerly admit.

<P>TO judge of the propriety of General Reed's perform|ance, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to refer the reader to his letter in page 277, which is a true copy from the original, in his own hand writing.</P>
<P>Lee remained at his retreat, living in a &s;tyle peculiar to him&s;elf, in a hou&s;e more like a barn than a palace. Gla&s;s windows and plai&s;tering would have been luxurious extravagance, and his furniture con&s;i&s;ted of a very few nece&s;&s;ary articles; indeed he was now &s;o ru&s;ticated, that he could have lived in a tub with Diogenes: however he had got a few &s;elect valuable authors, and the&s;e ena|bled him to pa&s;s away his time in this ob&s;curity. In the fall, 1782, he began to be weary with the &s;amene&s;s of his &s;ituation; and experiencing his unfitne&s;s for the ma|nagement of country bu&s;ine&s;s, he came to a determinati|on to &s;ell his e&s;tate, and procure a little &s;ettlement near &s;ome &s;ea-port town, where he might learn what the world was doing, and enjoy the conver&s;ation of man|kind.</P>
<P>His farm, though an excellent tract of land, rather brought him in debt at the end of the year, and added to the difficulties he laboured under. It is no wonder, then, he was inclined to relinqui&s;h his pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of life. He left Berkley, and came to Baltimore, where he &s;taid near a week with &s;ome old friends, and then took his leave for Philadelphia.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed he now found a difference between a <HI>General in command,</HI> and <HI>one</HI> de&s;titute of every thing but the name; for we do not find him entertained at the hou&s;e of any private citizen. He took lodgings at an inn
<PB N="41" REF="024456_0048_0FC7350C5EF36A88">
the &s;ign of the Conve&s;tigoe waggon, in Market-&s;treet. After being three or four days in the city, he was taken with a &s;hivering, the forerunner of a fever, which put a period to his exi&s;tence, October 2d, 1782.</P>
<P>A friend of the Editor's was at the inn when he took his departure from this world. The &s;ervants informed him that General Lee was dying: upon which he went into the room; he was then &s;truggling with the king of terrors, and &s;eemed to have lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es; the la&s;t words he heard him &s;peak were, "Stand by me, my brave grenadiers!"</P>
<P>The citizens of Philadelphia, calling to remembrance his former &s;ervices, appeared to be much affected at his death. His funeral was attended with a very large con|cour&s;e of people, the clergy of different denominations, his excellency the pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, the pre&s;ident, and &s;ome members of the council of the commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania, his excellency the mini&s;ter plenipoten|tiary of France, M. Marbois &s;ecretary to the emba&s;&s;y, the mini&s;ter of finance, General baron de Viominil, duke de Lau&s;am, the mini&s;ter of war, and &s;everal other officers of di&s;tinction both in the French and American army.</P>
<P>From what hath been ob&s;erved in the&s;e memoirs, we may with ju&s;tice affirm, that General Lee was a great and &s;in|cere friend to the rights and liberties of mankind, and that it was this grand principle which led him to take part on the &s;ide of America. It appears, that, from his youth, he was bred up with the highe&s;t regard for the noble &s;enti|ments of freedom; his education and reading &s;trength|ened them; the hi&s;torians and orators of Greece and Rome, with whom he was con&s;iderably conver&s;ant, ad|ded to the &s;acred flame; and his travels in many parts of the world did not tend to dimini&s;h it.</P>
<P>When a boy, he was &s;ent to an academy in Switzer|land, and he has frequently &s;aid to his friends, that he was there &s;truck with the general happine&s;s, affluence and ea&s;e diffu&s;ed throughout that country, notwith&s;tanding its natural di&s;advantages of &s;oil and climate. In one of his letters, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in this manner: "When
<PB N="42" REF="024456_0049_0FC7350D80ECBD78">
I was quite young in Switzerland, I could not help com|paring the robu&s;t well clothed commonalty of this coun|try, with their mi&s;erable neighbours of France, a &s;pot upon wich nature &s;eems to have taken pains to confer her favours. To France, Nature has given the mo&s;t fruitful &s;oil, which produceth not only every nece&s;&s;ary, but every luxury of life. She has given to its people a lively, active, enterpri&s;ing genius, a climate upon the whole the be&s;t of the world&mdash;To the Swi&s;s, &s;he bequeath|ed rocks, mountains, and, as it is thought, very inferior mental faculties; and yet the Swi&s;s are rich, happy and re&s;pectable; the French, &s;tarving and contemptible. In Italy, the contra&s;t betwixt the free, and tho&s;e who are not free, is &s;till more remarkable; I know very well, that the republics of Genoa and Venice are not in general al|lowed to be free &s;tates. Mon&s;ieur Monte&s;quieu has de|mon&s;trated that they are not free; but there is undoubt|edly &s;ome excellence in them, which has e&s;caped this wi&s;e man&mdash;&s;hall I beg leave to hazard a conjecture? They have no king: They have no court."</P>
<P>The General had read both men and books; his read|ing and travels were exten&s;ive, and of cour&s;e his man|ners ea&s;y and free of embarra&s;&s;ment; &s;o that he was fre|quently accu&s;tomed to deliver his &s;entiments and feel|ings without di&s;gui&s;e, from the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, accord|ing to the nature of the objects which pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>This liberality of conduct, and openne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, in a young country, cau&s;ed many to doubt of his belief in revealed religion; the common people, at la&s;t, con&s;i|dered him as an athei&s;t; while tho&s;e of a higher cla&s;s were more indulgent to his principles. If we were to form a judgment on this &s;ubject, from his private cor|re&s;pondence, we &s;hould not accu&s;e him as totally de&s;ti|tute of religious notions, for it appears that he enter|tained &s;ome grand and &s;ublime ideas of the Supreme Be|ing, and was &s;trongly per&s;uaded that no &s;ociety could exi&s;t without religion.</P>
<P>He has often a&s;&s;erted, that he thought the Chri&s;tian religion, unincumbered of its &s;ophi&s;tications, the mo&s;t
<PB N="43" REF="024456_0050_0FC7350F576F9688">
excellent, as comprehending the mo&s;t divine &s;y&s;tem of ethics, con&s;equently of a divine nature; but at the &s;ame time he di&s;approved of the length and tediou&s;ne&s;s of the liturgies of the various &s;ects. As to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he dogmas, he con&s;idered many of them ab&s;urd, if not impious, and de|rogatory to the honour, dignity and wi&s;dom of the God|head, or omni&s;cient ruler and moderator of the infinity of worlds that &s;urround us.</P>
<P>The General, in his per&s;on, was of a genteel make, and rather above the middle &s;ize; his remarkable aqui|line no&s;e rendered his face &s;omewhat di&s;agreeable. He was ma&s;ter of a mo&s;t genteel addre&s;s; but, in the latter part of his life, became exce&s;&s;ively negligent of the gra|ces, both in garb and behaviour. A talent for repartee, united with a quickne&s;s of penetration, created him ma|ny enemies. A character &s;o eccentric and &s;ingular, could not fail of attracting the popular attention. His <HI>&s;mall friends</HI> frequently pa&s;&s;ed &s;evere critici&s;ms on his words and actions. Narrowly watched, every little &s;lip or fai|lure was noticed, and repre&s;ented to his di&s;advantage. The objections to his moral conduct were numerous, and his great fondne&s;s for dogs brought on him the di&s;|like and frowns of the fair &s;ex: for the general would permit his canine adherents to follow him to the parlour, the bed-room, and &s;ometimes they might be &s;een on a chair next his elbow at table.</P>
<P>As the ladies are commonly again&s;t any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the laws of decency and cleanline&s;s, it is no wonder a &s;hyne&s;s commenced between them and the General. This hath given &s;ome per&s;ons an idea of his being aver&s;e to women, which in reality was not the ca&s;e; for his life and po&s;thumous papers will furni&s;h &s;everal exam|ples of his early attachment to them; and a letter to him, from a Briti&s;h officer in Montreal, in 1774, con|vinces the Editor of his having been &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ame feelings with other men, and of his having fre|quently indulged him&s;elf in gallantry with the ladies. "During the winter," &s;ays this officer, who was the General's intimate friend, "I took a trip to Quebec,
<PB N="44" REF="024456_0051_0FC73514F7EBE330">
where I pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal agreeable days with <HI>your queen.</HI> I delivered your compliments to her, and &s;he enquired particularly about you, de&s;iring me to return them mo&s;t &s;incerely whenever I wrote&mdash;She is the &s;ame amiable creature, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition neither climate nor country can alter, and as &s;trongly attached to you as ever." And his letter from War&s;aw to Loui&s;a, demon&s;trates the &s;ame fact.</P>
<P>There is great probability the General was the fir&s;t per&s;on who &s;ugge&s;ted the idea that America ought to declare her&s;elf independent. When he was &s;ent by the commander in chief to New-York, he behaved with &s;uch activity and &s;pirit, infu&s;ing the &s;ame into the minds of his troops and the people, that Mr. John Adams &s;aid, "a happier expedition never was projected; and that the whole Whig world were ble&s;&s;ing him for it." About this time Doctor Franklin gave Mr. Thomas Paine, the celebrated author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> an introductory let|ter to him, in which were the&s;e words: "The bearer, Mr. Paine, has reque&s;ted a line of introduction to you, which I give the more willingly, as I know his &s;enti|ments are not very different from yours." A few days after, the Doctor writes again, "There is a kind of &s;u&s;pen&s;e in men's minds here at pre&s;ent, waiting to &s;ee what terms will be offered from England&mdash;I expect none that we can accept; and when that is generally &s;een, we &s;hall be more unanimous and more deci&s;ive. Then your propo&s;ed &s;olemn league and covenant will go better down, and perhaps mo&s;t of <HI>your other &s;trong mea&s;ures</HI> adopted." In a letter to Edward Rutlege, E&s;q. in the &s;pring of 1776, then a member of the Continen|tal Congre&s;s, the General thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf. "As your affairs pro&s;per, the timidity of the &s;enatorial part of the continent, great and &s;mall, grows and extends it&s;elf. By the Eternal G&mdash;d, unle&s;s you <HI>declare your&s;elves inde|pendent,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h a more certain and fixed legi&s;lature than that of a temporary courte&s;y of the people, you richly de&s;erve to be en&s;laved, and I think far from im|po&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be your lot; as, without a more

&s;y&s;tematic intercour&s;e with France and Holland, we can|not, we have not the means of carrying on the war." There are other epi&s;tles of his, of a &s;imilar &s;pirit and diction.</P>
<P>The more we inve&s;tigate the General's character and conduct, the more con&s;picuous his &s;ervices will appear. In the infancy of the American di&s;pute, we all find him continually &s;ugge&s;ting and forwarding plans for the de|fence of the country; and though he was a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to a &s;tanding army, he was always recommend|ing a well regulated militia. This he con&s;idered as the natural &s;trength of a country, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;afety and pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>He has frequently a&s;&s;erted, that a more pernicious idea could not enter into the heads of the citizens, than that rigid di&s;cipline, and a &s;trict &s;ubjection to military rules, were incompatible with civil liberty; and he was of opinion, that when the bulk of a community would not &s;ubmit to the ordinances nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;erva|tion of military di&s;cipline, their liberty could not be of long continuance.</P>
<P>The liberty of every commonwealth mu&s;t be protected ultimately by military force. Military force depends up|on order and di&s;cipline: without order and di&s;cipline, the greate&s;t number of armed men are only a contemp|tible mob; a handful of regulars mu&s;t di&s;per&s;e them. It follows then, that the citizens at large mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the means of becoming &s;oldiers, or that they mu&s;t com|mit the protection of their lives and property to a di&s;|tinct body of men, who will naturally, in a &s;hort time, &s;et up a profe&s;&s;ional intere&s;t, &s;eparate from the commu|nity at large. To this cau&s;e we may attribute the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of every free State that hi&s;tory pre&s;ents to us. The Romans were certainly the fir&s;t and mo&s;t glorious people that have figured on the face of the globe; they continued free longe&s;t. Every citizen was a &s;oldier, and a &s;oldier not in name, but in fact; by which is meant, that they were the mo&s;t rigid ob&s;ervers of mili|tary in&s;titutions. The General therefore thought it ex|pedient
<PB N="46" REF="024456_0053_0FC73519829FFF40">
that every State in America &s;hould be extremely careful to perfect the laws relative to their militia; and that, where they were glaringly defective, they &s;hould be made more efficient; and that it &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed as a point of honour, and the criterion of a virtuous citizen, to pay the greate&s;t deference to the common ne|ce&s;&s;ary laws of a camp.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t difficult ta&s;k the Editor met with in collec|ting and arranging the&s;e Po&s;thumous Papers, aro&s;e from his de&s;ire of not giving offence to &s;uch characters as had been the object of the General's aver&s;ion and re&s;entment. Unhappily his di&s;appointments had &s;oured his temper; the affair of Monmouth, &s;everal pieces of &s;currility from the pre&s;s, and numerous in&s;tances of private &s;lander and defamation, &s;o far got the better of his philo&s;ophy, as to provoke him in the highe&s;t degree, and he became, as it were, angry with all mankind.</P>
<P>To this exa&s;perated di&s;po&s;ition we may impute the origin of his political queries, and a number of &s;atirical hints thrown out both in his conver&s;ation and writing&punc; again&s;t the Commander in Chief. Humanity will draw a veil over the involuntary errors of &s;en&s;ibility, and par|don the &s;allies of a &s;uffering mind, as its pre&s;ages did not meet with an accompli&s;hment. General Wa&s;hing|ton, by his retirement, demon&s;trated to the world, that power was not his object; that America had nothing to fear from his ambition; but that &s;he was honoured with a &s;pecimen of &s;uch exalted patrioti&s;m as could not fail to attract the attention and admiration of the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations.</P>
<P>The reader will not wonder that General Lee, di&s;ap|pointed in his career of glory, &s;hould be continually in|culcating an idea of the extreme danger of tru&s;ting too much to the wi&s;dom of <HI>one,</HI> for the &s;afety of the <HI>whole;</HI> that he &s;hould con&s;ider it as repugnant to the principles of freedom and republicani&s;m, to continue for years, one man as commander in chief; that there &s;hould be a rotation of office, military as well as civil; and though the commander of an army po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the virtues of
<PB N="47" REF="024456_0054_0FC7351C0F79D678">
Cato, and the talents of Julius Cae&s;ar, it could not alter the nature of the thing; &s;ince by habituating the peo|ple to look up to one man, all true republican &s;pirit be|came enervated, and a vi&s;ible propen&s;ity to monarchial government was created and fo&s;tered; that there was a charm in the long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of high office, and in the pomp and influence that attended it, which might cor|rupt the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Indeed it was the opinion of Marcus Aurelius, who&s;e virtues not only honoured the throne, but human nature, that to have the power of doing much, and to confine that power to doing good, was a prodigy in nature. Such &s;entiments of this divine prince, who was not only train|ed up in the &s;chools of au&s;tere philo&s;ophy, but who&s;e elevated &s;ituation rendered him the mo&s;t able judge of the difficulty there is in not abu&s;ing exten&s;ive power, when we have it in our hands, furni&s;h &s;ub&s;tantial argu|ments for not entru&s;ting it to any mortal what&s;oever. But while we are convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e &s;en|timents, we are led the more to re&s;pect and reverence our mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted Commander in Chief, who &s;tands con&s;picuous, with unrivalled glory, &s;uperior to the fa&s;|cinations which have overthrown many a great and no|ble mind.</P>
<P>The editor conceives his pre&s;ent labours, in the com|pilation of this work, will be u&s;eful, and throw &s;ome light on the hi&s;tory of the late revolution&mdash;a monument of the arduous &s;truggle, exhibiting a faithful and valua|ble collection of military and political corre&s;pondence.</P>

<P>The lots in the pomoerium are intended for the chil|dren of the State, when they are of an age to &s;ettle and marry. As the colony is military, (as every colony ought to be, if they intend to be free) a con&s;tant exerci&s;ed mi|litia &s;hall be kept up, but by annual rotation: for which purpo&s;e, the fifth part of the men fit to bear arms, from &s;eventeen to forty-five, &s;hall be embodied for two months of the year, their manoeuvres as &s;imple as can be devi&s;ed: but no &s;ub&s;titutes are to be allowed, on any pretence, but ab&s;olute infirmity; and even tho&s;e who are not em|bodied, &s;hall, in their certain di&s;tricts, be obliged to a&s;|&s;emble every week, practice &s;ome &s;imple evolutions, &s;uch as marching in front, retreating and rallying by their colours, and all firing at marks.</P>

others in which I have &s;erved. I have &s;een two or three wretches, who had the misfortune to be detected in ma|rauding, or attempting to de&s;ert, taken out with awful form, encircled by a multitude who had been guilty of, or had intended to have committed the &s;ame crimes, but happily had not been di&s;covered; the chaplain, in his canonicals, telling them how dreadful a thing it was for their &s;ouls to be divorced from their bodies, and to be urged on to the tribunal of their Maker, with the&s;e horrid &s;ins on their heads. A few hours afterwards, &s;ome de&s;perate expedition ordered to be executed by the very men who had been pre&s;ent at the execution, who had committed, or had intended to commit, the very &s;ame horrid crimes; and the officer appointed to com|mand the expedition, as u&s;ual, harangues the &s;oldiers; a&s;&s;ures them that death is not a &s;erious affair; that, as all men mu&s;t &s;ooner or later die, it is of little moment when it happens.

Let the lo&s;s of liberty, and igno|miny, be inculcated as the extreme of all puni&s;hments: common culprits therefore are, in proportion to the de|gree of their delinquency, to be condemned to &s;lavery, for a longer or &s;horter term of years; to public works, &s;uch as repairing highways, and public buildings, with &s;ome ignominious di&s;tinction of habit, denoting their condition. As to tho&s;e who have been guilty of crimes of a very deep dye, &s;uch as wanton murder, perjury, and the like, let them be mutilated, their ears cut off, their faces &s;tamped with the marks of infamy, and whipped out of the State.</P>

as Tyre, Venice, and Holland: but I cannot conceive how a community of &s;oldiers and agriculturers, who have lands enough to cultivate, not only for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, but in a great mea&s;ure for others, &s;hould have oc|ca&s;ion for what is called great and exten&s;ive commerce.

Let any man of ta&s;te or &s;en&s;ibility a&s;&s;ociate only for a few months with commercial men, or re&s;ide in a commerci|al city, he will find their conver&s;ation dull, languid, and &s;tupid; their plea&s;ures confined to gro&s;s eating and drink|ing; their only idea of mirth, to the roaring of &s;ome vile hoar&s;e &s;inger; and of wit, to the &s;tory-teller of the club, or &s;ome wretched pun&s;ter, who lives on catches and crotchets.

<P>Before I enter into the explication of the method that &s;hould be pur&s;ued to acquire this talent, fal&s;ely thought to be a gift of Nature, it is nece&s;&s;ary to define it.&mdash;The military <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> then, is nothing el&s;e than the art of knowing the nature and different &s;ituations of the coun|try where we make and intend to carry the war; the advantages and di&s;advantages of the camp and po&s;ts that we mean to occupy; as likewi&s;e tho&s;e which may be fa|vourable or di&s;advantageous to the enemy. By the po|&s;ition of our army, and the con&s;equences drawn from it, we may not only form with preci&s;ion our de&s;igns for the pre&s;ent, but judge of tho&s;e we may afterwards have. It is alone by this knowledge of the country into which we carry the war, that a great Captain can fore&s;ee the events of the whole campaign, and, if it may be &s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ed, render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of them; becau&s;e, judg|ing from what he him&s;elf has done, of what the enemy mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily do, forced as they are, by the nature of the places, to regulate their movements to oppo&s;e his de|&s;igns, he conducts them from po&s;t to po&s;t, from camp to camp, to the very point he has propo&s;ed to him&s;elf to in&s;ure victory. Such, in a few words, is the military <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> without which it is impo&s;&s;ible that a General &s;hould avoid falling into a number of faults of the great|e&s;t con&s;equence. In a word, there are little hopes of victory if we are de&s;titute of what is called the <HI>coup
<PB N="57" REF="024456_0064_0FC7353FC9672290">
d'oeil</HI> of war; and as the military &s;cience is of the &s;ame nature with all others that require practice to po&s;&s;e&s;s them in all the different parts that compo&s;e them, this which I treat of, is, of all others, that which requires the greate&s;t practice.</P>
<P>Philopoemen, one of the greate&s;t Captains that Greece produced, and whom an illu&s;trious Roman has called the la&s;t of the Grecians, had the <HI>coup d'oeil</HI> in an admi|rable degree; but we ought not to confides it as a gift of Nature, but as the fruit of &s;tudy, application, and his extreme pa&s;&s;ion for war. Plutarch informs us of the method he u&s;ed to enable him&s;elf to &s;ee with his own eyes, rather than tho&s;e of other people, when he was at the head of armies. The pa&s;&s;age de&s;erves to be quoted.</P>
<P>"He willingly li&s;tened," &s;ays the Greek author," to the di&s;cour&s;es, and read the treati&s;es of the philo&s;ophers; not all, but only tho&s;e which could aid him in his pur&s;uit of virtue; and of all the great ideas of Home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he fought for, and retained tho&s;e alone which could wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t his cou|rage, and animate him towards great actions: and of all other lecturers, he pre&s;erved the treati&s;es of Evange|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, called the Tactics, that is, the art of ranging troops in order of battle; and the hi&s;tories of the life of Alex|ander; for he thought that language was of no further u&s;e than its reference to action, and that the only and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ding was to learn how to conduct our&s;elves; unle&s;s we chu&s;e to read merely to pa&s;s the time, or to furni&s;h our&s;elves with the means of keeping up idle and fruit|le&s;s chat.</P>
<P>"When he had read the precepts and rules of the tac|tics, he did not trouble his head about &s;eeing the demon|&s;tration of them by plans on paper, but made the appli|cation of them in the very &s;cenes of action, and in open field; for, in his marches, he accurately ob&s;erved the eminences and low places, the breaks and irregularities of the ground, and all the forms and figures which bat|talions and &s;quadrons are obliged to take in con&s;equence of rivulets, ravines, and defiles, which force them to clo&s;e or extend them&s;elves. In general, it appears, that
<PB N="58" REF="024456_0065_0FC73542DFCF6AD8">
Philopoemen had a very &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for arms; that he embraced war as a profe&s;&s;ion that gave greater play to his virtues; in a word, he de&s;pi&s;ed all tho&s;e as idle and u&s;ele&s;s members of the community, who did not apply them&s;elves to it."</P>
<P>The&s;e, in abridgment, are the mo&s;t excellent precepts that can be given to a prince, the general of an army, and every officer who wi&s;hes to arrive at the highe&s;t de|gree of military rank. This is the only method; and, as the tran&s;lator has very judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved, renders the putting the precepts into practice, on occa&s;ion, more ea&s;y than by &s;tudying the plans on paper. Plutarch ac|cu&s;es, and even &s;everely cen&s;ures Philopoemen for having carried his pa&s;&s;ion for arms beyond the bounds of mo|deration. Mon&s;. Dacier does not fail to chime in with him; but, both the one and the other, without well knowing what they &s;ay, have pa&s;&s;ed an unfair judgment on this great captain; as if the &s;cience of war was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t immen&s;e, and did not comprehend all others in its vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tex; and as if, to acquire a perfect knowledge of it, a long and laborious application was not nece&s;&s;ary.

Why, then, be offended that a man &s;hould apply and give him&s;elf entirely up to the &s;tudy of the &s;ciences which have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|lation to his profe&s;&s;ion?&mdash;That of arms is not only mo&s;t noble, but the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and profound; con&s;equent|ly it demands the greate&s;t application. What this gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Captain did to acquire the <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> is extremely ne|ce&s;&s;ary and important for the command of armies, on which depend the glory and &s;afety of the State.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but that tactics, or the art of rang|ing armies in the order of battle, of encamping and fighting them, is a mo&s;t royal attainment. What could be the rea&s;on that Hannibal ranked Pyrrhus king of the Epirots, before Scipio, and immediately after Alexander,
<PB N="59" REF="024456_0066_0FC7354443ED7288">
although the latter was certainly the able&s;t man? It was, doubtle&s;s, becau&s;e the fir&s;t excelled all mankind in this great part of war, although Scipio did not yield to him in this point, as he made appear at the battle of Lama. Hannibal was le&s;s practi&s;ed in this branch than the two others. Philopoemen &s;aw that the &s;tudy of tac|tics, and the treati&s;es of Evangelus, were of no u&s;e to him, unle&s;s he joined to them the <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> &s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry to the general of an army. His method always plea&s;|ed me, and it is what I have ever practi&s;ed in my jour|neys, and in the camp; for we ought not to wait for the opportunity of war to acquire the <HI>caup d'oeil,</HI> but it may be learnt and obtained by the exerci&s;e of hunting.</P>
<P>To attain this &s;cience, many things are nece&s;&s;ary. Se|vere application to our profe&s;&s;ion is the ba&s;is; then a certain method is to be adopted: Although that of this Grecian Captain is good, I think I have improved upon it, or at lea&s;t di&s;covered that which the Greek author has omitted to teach us more particularly. We are not always at war, nor is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that we can ren|der our&s;elves able by experience alone, on which indeed the capacity of the greater part of military men in the&s;e ages is founded: it &s;erves to perfect us, but is &s;carcely of any u&s;e unle&s;s the &s;tudy of the principles accompany it; becau&s;e war being a &s;cience, it is impo&s;&s;ible to make any progre&s;s without beginning with the &s;tudy of the principles. Two ages of perpetual war would &s;carcely &s;uffice to furni&s;h lights for our conduct: from the ex|perience of facts, this ought to be left to &s;ouls of an or|dinary &s;tamp, and more compendious methods be pro|vided for great Captains to mount to the &s;ummit of glo|ry, without being indebted for it to the capacity of o|thers, which is not always to be met with. It is, then, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy war before we engage in it, and to apply our&s;elves ince&s;&s;antly after we are engaged in it. I have before &s;aid, that we are not always at war; and I may add, that armies are not always drawn together in a body, or in motion. They are for &s;ix months at lea&s;t quiet in winter quarters; and &s;ix months are not &s;uffici|ent
<PB N="60" REF="024456_0067_0FC73545EA2AC8D8">
to form the <HI>coup d'oeil</HI> of war. It is true, that a great deal more is to be learnt in marches, in forages, and in the different camps and po&s;ts which armies occupy: the ideas become more clear and capable to judge of, and reflect on, the country we &s;ee; but this does not prevent us from making u&s;e of it, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of good &s;en&s;e, on other occa&s;ions than when in armies; or from re|fining our jugdment and eye, either by hunting, or on our journeys:&mdash;this I can &s;peak of from experience.</P>
<P>Nothing contributes more to form the <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> than the exerci&s;e of hunting; for, be&s;ides giving us a thorough knowledge of the country, and of the different &s;ituations; which are infinite, and never the &s;ame, it teaches us a thou&s;and &s;tratagems and other things relative to war. But the principle is the knowledge of the objects that form the <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> without our being &s;en&s;ible of it; and if we practice it with this intention, we may with the addition of a very few reflections, acquire the greate&s;t and mo&s;t important qualification of a general of an army.</P>
<P>The great Cyrus, in giving him&s;elf entirely up to hunt|ing in his younger years, had the plea&s;ure of it le&s;s in view than the de&s;ign of qualifying him&s;elf for war and the command of armies. Xenophon, who wrote his life, does not leave us in the lea&s;t doubt on this head. He &s;ays, that this great man, on his preparing for war with the king of Armenia, rea&s;oned upon this expediti|on as if the que&s;tion had been of a party of hunting in a mountainous country. He explained him&s;elf thus to Chry&s;antes, one of his general officers, whom he had detached into the roughe&s;t parts, and the mo&s;t difficult vallies, in order to gain the entrances and i&s;&s;ues, and to cut off all retreat to the enemy. "Imagine," &s;ays he, "that it is a chace we are engaged in, and that it is al|lotted to thee to watch at the toils, whil&s;t I beat the country. Above all, remember not to begin the chace before all the pa&s;&s;ages are occupied, and that tho&s;e who are placed in ambu&s;cade be not &s;een, le&s;t they &s;hould frighten the game. Take care not to engage thy&s;elf too

far in the woods, from whence thou mighte&s;t find it dif|ficult to extricate thy&s;elf; and command your guides, unle&s;s they could indeed &s;horten the di&s;tances, to conduct you by the be&s;t roads, which, with re&s;pect to armies, are always the &s;horte&s;t."</P>
<P>Whether or not Xenophon, in his hi&s;tory of Cyrus, has run into romance in order to give us an abridgment of the military &s;cience treated hi&s;torically, is a matter of no great importance, provided that all it contains relative to this &s;cience be ju&s;t and &s;olid. His intention is to con|vince us that hunting leads us to the knowledge of many things nece&s;&s;ary to be known&mdash;that it is a becoming amu&s;ement, and extremely nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who are either born to command or to obey; becau&s;e it enures us to bear the fatigue of war, &s;trengthens the con&s;tituti|on, and forms the <HI>coup d'oeil;</HI> for an exact knowledge of a certain extent of country, facilitates that of others, if he but &s;ees it in the &s;lighte&s;t manner. It is impo&s;&s;ible, although they are widely different, that there &s;hould not be &s;ome conformity betwixt them; and the perfect know|ledge of one (&s;ays Machiavel in his political di&s;cour&s;es) leads to that of another. On the contrary, tho&s;e who are not trained in this practice, have the greate&s;t difficulty to acquire it; whil&s;t the others, by a &s;ingle glance of the eye, can a&s;certain the extent of a plain, the height of a mountain, the depth, breadth, and termination of a val|ley, and all the circum&s;tances of the nature of the differ|ent grounds to which they are accu&s;tomed by habit and experience. I do not believe that any other author, than this I have quoted, has treated of this matter. The remainder is excellent; I &s;hall beg leave to tran|&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>"Nothing is more true," continues he, "than what I here advance, if we may give credit to Titus Livius, and the example he pre&s;ents to our eyes in the per&s;on of Publius Decius, who was Tribune in the Roman army, commanded by the Con&s;ul Cornelius, again&s;t the Sam|nites. It happened that this General &s;uffered him&s;elf to be pu&s;hed into a valley, where the enemy might have
<PB N="62" REF="024456_0069_0FC7354DB9C08FA8">
pent him up. In this extremity, Decius &s;ays to the Con&s;ul, "Don't you perceive yonder eminence, which commands the enemy? This is the po&s;t that alone can extricate us, if we do not lo&s;e a &s;ingle moment in ma|king our&s;elves ma&s;ter of it, as the Samnites have been &s;o blind as to abandon it." But before Decius addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this manner to the Con&s;ul, he had di&s;covered through the wood, a hill which commanded the camp of the enemy; that it was &s;teep, and of a pretty difficult acce&s;s for heavy armed troops, but practicable enough to the light infantry. That the Con&s;ul ordered the Tribune to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it with three thou&s;and men, that he had con&s;igned to him; which having happily executed, the whole army retreated in order to put them&s;elves in a place of &s;afety. That he ordered &s;ome few of his people to follow, whil&s;t there was yet &s;ome remains of day-light, in order to di&s;cover the pa&s;&s;es guarded by the enemy, and tho&s;e by which a retreat might be made; and he went to reconnoitre, di&s;gui&s;ed in the habit of a common &s;oldier, that the Samnites might not perceive taht it was a general officer who was on the &s;cout."</P>
<P>"If we reflect," continues Machiavel, "upon what Titus Livius here &s;ays, we &s;hall &s;ee how nece&s;&s;ary it is for a good General to be able to judge of the nature of a country; for if Decius had not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this talent, he would not have known how advantageous the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this hill mu&s;t have been to the Romans; and he would have been incapable of di&s;covering, at a di&s;tance, whether it was of ea&s;y or difficult acce&s;s. When, after|wards, he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, and when the point was to rejoin the Con&s;ul, he would not have been able, at a di&s;tance, to di&s;cover which po&s;ts were guarded by the enemy, and tho&s;e by which a retreat was practi|cable. Decius, therefore, mu&s;t certainly have been very intelligent in the&s;e &s;ort of matters; for otherwi&s;e he could not have &s;aved the Roman army by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this hill, and afterwards extricated him&s;elf from the ene|my, who had &s;urrounded him."</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="024456_0070_0FC73552A778EB60">There are very few military men who are capable of drawing, from an hi&s;torical fact, &s;uch ob&s;ervations as the&s;e I have cited from Machiavel: the mo&s;t con&s;um|mate ma&s;ter in the profe&s;&s;ion could do no more. I am not at all &s;urprized at it; a profound and well dige&s;ted &s;tudy of hi&s;tory nece&s;&s;arily leads us to the knowledge of an infinity of things, which enable us to judge &s;oundly and &s;olidly of all. The &s;tudy of politics, of which hi&s;to|ry is the ba&s;is, is a powerful means of perfecting our under&s;tanding and judgment.</P>
<P>The political and military di&s;cour&s;es of this author, on the Decades of Livy, are an immortal work. I think them worthy the curio&s;ity of all military men&mdash;&mdash;of being attentively read and well dige&s;ted. His life of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">truc|ciom, one of the greate&s;t Captains of his age, though not very much known, is not le&s;s admirable.

So hap|py a turn had this man for the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, (ex|cepting his book on the article of war, which does not do him a great deal of honour, although it is pillaged from Vegetius) he is admirable in all. He lived at a time when Italy was &s;o agitated with trouble, inte&s;tine and foreign wars, that we mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed if a man of &s;en&s;e and judgment, and learned be&s;ides, was equal to &s;o noble a performance; becau&s;e, as he was on the &s;cene of action, he had the means of obtaining the mo&s;t excel|lent materials, and of conver&s;ing with officers who had &s;erved in the&s;e wars.</P>

of the Grecian largene&s;s and contour. Her forehead is of a poli&s;h and formation not to be matched. Her lips are full and ripe, from which i&s;&s;ues a breath which would create de&s;ires in age and coldne&s;s. Her neck is of &s;uch a colour and &s;ymmetry as to make us cur&s;e invidi|ous cu&s;tom for preventing us gazing on the whole of &s;o amiable a piece of workman&s;hip.

<P>No man has &s;een her laugh; but &s;he &s;miles frequently.

She has, at times, a da&s;h of melancholy in her countenance, which is more becoming than her &s;miles. The&s;e &s;hort &s;ymptoms of melancholy I &s;hould attribute to her vacancy of heart, to her want of &s;ome one object upon which &s;he may for her affections; a nece&s;&s;ity which Nature has impo&s;ed upon Woman for a wi&s;e purpo&s;e&mdash;the perpetuation of the human race.</P>
<P>She has faults; but her faults &s;eem to be acquired&mdash; her virtues a native inheritance. She is &s;o general, that it almo&s;t amounts to coquetry. She makes too little di|&s;tinction betwixt the men of merit and &s;en&s;e, and the fooli&s;h and unde&s;erving. She can cruelly &s;uffer the &s;in|cere re&s;pectful lover to langui&s;h without a glimmer of hope, and give encouragement to the a&s;&s;ured, indifferent coxcomb, who would boa&s;t of favours which &s;he is, perhaps, determined to confer on no man.

<P>A young &s;ubaltern, who &s;eemed to have great fire and &s;entiment, and with more reading than young &s;ubalterns are generally ma&s;ters of, was extremely bitter on Mr. Hume: he loaded him with a thou&s;and opprobriums; he &s;tiled him a &s;ophi&s;t, a je&s;uit, a thei&s;tical champion of de&s;poti&s;m, who had dethroned the God of Heaven, and deified the &s;ceptered mon&s;ters of the earth. The young man was taken up by a grey-headed field-officer, who was &s;o warm a partizan of Mr. Hume's, that he leaned not only towards ab&s;olute (or in his favourite author's terms) pure unmixed monarchy, but vi&s;ibly towards jacc|biti&s;m. He &s;poke of Charles the Fir&s;t with an idola|trous reverence, and of all his opponents with the greate&s;t

horror and indignation: this led him to a great deal of abu&s;e on Mrs. M'Cawley; he lamented that a compo&s;i|tion of this nature was &s;uffered to be publi&s;hed, which mu&s;t in&s;til the mo&s;t damnable republican principles into the minds of our youth; that it already had dimini&s;hed that re&s;pect to royalty &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be kept up: and that the young gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t had furni&s;hed us with an in&s;tance, that the army had not e&s;caped the contagion&mdash;a mo&s;t alarming con&s;ideration! as their di&s;|re&s;pect to crowned heads was not manife&s;ted alone by opinions injurious to the royal martyr, but that &s;everal of them had frequently in their conver&s;ations declared their di&s;approbation of &s;ome part of the pre&s;ent reign; that &s;uch &s;entiments, and &s;uch language, were not only repugnant to the &s;pirit of our military laws, but indecent and ungrateful in tho&s;e who <HI>eat his Maje&s;ty's bread.</HI>&mdash; This he uttered with &s;o much empha&s;is, that the greate&s;t part of the company was terrified into &s;ilence; and the young &s;ubaltern began to think he had been guilty in &s;ome mea&s;ure of trea&s;on, and, I believe, would have prevaricated him&s;elf into other &s;entiments than tho&s;e he had profe&s;&s;ed, had I not taken up his cau&s;e, ju&s;tified all he had advanced, and encouraged him to fo&s;ter the noble principles he had imbibed. I demanded of our veteran to explain his meaning in &s;aying that <HI>we eat his Maje&s;ty's bread;</HI> whence had his Maje&s;ty drawn funds to feed &s;o many mouths? Were coffers of gold tran&s;ported from his per&s;onal e&s;tates in Germany? or, had he di&s;covered in his gardens at Kew, trea&s;ures &s;ufficient for &s;uch prodi|gious munificence?

fed us comfortably, clothed us in &s;mart red coats, put &s;words by our &s;ides, and erected us into the condition of gentlemen?

I confe&s;&s;ed that his Maje&s;ty, as one branch of the legi&s;lature, and executive magi&s;trate, was entitled to a very high degree of reverence from &s;oldiers as well as other citizens, as long as he fulfilled the duties of his &s;tation; but that &s;till a higher degree of reverence and attachment was due to the freedom, laws, pro&s;perity and glory of our country, than per&s;onally to the fir&s;t magi&s;|trate, let him fill his office ever &s;o worthily. When it was remembered, I added, that the pre&s;ent reigning fa|mily

had been taken from a German electorate, not the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, exalted to the head of a mighty em|pire, endowed with adequate revenues, and inve&s;ted with the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dlike powers of executing ju&s;tice, but &s;often|ing its rigours of dealing out mercy, but re&s;trained from evil; I &s;aid, when the&s;e things were remembered, &s;hould his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, or any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, pervert the power granted by the genero&s;ity and confidence of the people, to the prejudice or di&s;honour of the people, the officers of the army, no more than any other cla&s;s of citizens, could not be taxed with ingratitude, or inde|cency, in cen&s;uring their prince, but the prince in fur|ni&s;hing matter of cen&s;ure.&mdash;The old field-officer began to &s;often: he confe&s;&s;ed that his expre&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to the officer's eating his Maje&s;ty's bread was improper; but &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that the army ought to be more re&s;erv|ed in their cen&s;ure than any other order of men, as they &s;eemed to be held in higher e&s;teem by the pre&s;ent Court than any other order. In this again I totally differed from the old gentleman. I a&s;&s;erted it was the rever&s;e: that the army had been treated through the whole pre|&s;ent reign, both individually and collectively, with more contempt and ingratitude than in any reign of any age or any country; that the ill u&s;age of the army had not been confined to the living, it had extended to the dead. To begin with Mr. Wolfe, to who&s;e valour and conduct we owed the acqui&s;ition of a mighty empire, how irre|verently had his a&s;hes been treated by government! The nation had indeed gratefully and generou&s;ly voted a mo|nument to their hero; the nation had paid the money, but unfortunately his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters were the tru&s;|tees: to this day therefore we &s;ee no monument erected; the money rai&s;ed on the people for this purpo&s;e, having probably been converted to the u&s;e of &s;ome living wor|thies, not very far di&s;tant from We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey.

reign di&s;played towards the &s;oldiery is &s;till more &s;triking; the di&s;tribution of the plunder of the Havan|nah is &s;o notorious that it would be impertinent to men|tion it; but the motives of this di&s;tribution are &s;o curi|ous, that it is difficult not frequently to recur to them. They were the&s;e: The Earl of Bute and his great ad|junct lived in perpetual apprehen&s;ions of the late Duke of Cumberland; the firmne&s;s of the man, his known courage, his good &s;en&s;e, but above all his principles and attachment to the welfare and honour of his country, rendered him an object of terror to tho&s;e who were de|termined to &s;acrifice every thing to the maintenance of their own power and authority&mdash;after having revolved in their minds what was the mo&s;t probable method of &s;oftening this bar to their &s;chemes into &s;ome complacen|cy, it was concluded, that to win this favourite, was the plan of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing a&s;pect.</P>
<P>The expedition again&s;t the Havannah was at this time re&s;olved upon; the troops and fleet were in readine&s;s; my lord of Albemarle was on this principle appointed to the command, and on this principle &s;o enormou&s;ly en|riched at the expence of the labour, health and blood of the mo&s;t noble de&s;erving army that this, or perhaps any other country, has been ever &s;erved by. His lord&s;hip and his family were indeed aggrandized; but the great views of the di&s;tributers were happily di&s;appointed. The Duke of Cumberland per&s;i&s;ted in his integrity, and con|tinued an hone&s;t zealous citizen until the fatal moment when he was &s;natched away from his country. I think, without rant or exaggeration, it may be termed a fatal moment:&mdash;he was indi&s;putably a valuable true Engli&s;h|man: he had, in the early parts of his life, through an over zeal for reforming the army from the mi&s;erable con|dition in which he found them, projected &s;chemes not unexceptionable; but this mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to a defer|ence which he paid to the opinion of men infinitely in|ferior to him&s;elf, both in virtue and talents: but in his latter years, his great and good qualities demon&s;trated them&s;elves &s;o fully, that we may fairly conclude, had

fate &s;pared him, he might at lea&s;t have checked the tor|rent of tho&s;e bitter waters broke in upon us from their accur&s;ed &s;ource of Carleton-Hou&s;e.&mdash;But before I take leave of America, I cannot help ob&s;erving the extraor|dinary attention paid to the officers and &s;oldiers in the allotment of lands; it would be endle&s;s to enter into the detail of the royal or mini&s;terial (for the&s;e terms have been of late &s;o confounded together that it is puzzling to di&s;tingui&s;h them) bounty in this particular; I &s;hall in&s;tance one or two which may &s;uffice for the whole.</P>
<P>It had long been &s;uppo&s;ed that the i&s;land of St. John's in the gulph of St. Lawrence, would have been a pro|fitable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. A &s;et of officers of the land and &s;ea &s;ervice, laid out a plan for the &s;ettlement of it. They pre&s;ented it to Government, and petitioned a grant of it. The grant was promi&s;ed. The officers dangled from day to day for the fulfilling of this promi&s;e. They were &s;huffled from the Admiralty to the Board of Trade, from the Board of Trade to the Admiralty, from an Egmont to an Hill&s;borough, from an Hill&s;borough to an Egmont, for the &s;pace, I believe, of three years. Egmont accu&s;es Hill&s;borough as the cau&s;e of this delay; Hill&s;borough accu&s;es Egmont; his Maje&s;ty &s;tands neuter betwixt the&s;e two righteous per&s;onages.</P>
<P>The Officers danced attendance until they found them|&s;elves on the thre&s;hold of a jail; but at length it is de|cided: The officers who were the original petitioners, got half a lot. Mr. Touchit, or Touchat (for I have not the honour of knowing how he &s;pells his name) &s;ome court &s;urgeons, and every kind of court retainer, who thinks it worth his while to hint that he has no objection to an American po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is gratified with a whole lot.</P>
<P>Another &s;ociety of officers had &s;olicited a grant of lands on the river St. Lawrence, which they undertook to &s;ettle; this was flatly refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Another &s;ociety &s;olicited for lands on the lower parts of the Illinois, Ohio, or on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi: that was like|wi&s;e rejected; but from what motives it is impo&s;&s;ible to define, unle&s;s they &s;uppo&s;e that &s;oldiers inve&s;ted with
<PB N="72" REF="024456_0079_0FC7356F47FB4A08">
a little landed property, would not be &s;o readily induced to act as the in&s;truments of the oppre&s;&s;ion of their fel|low &s;ubjects, as tho&s;e who&s;e views are &s;olely turned, if not reduced, to farther promotion; and if reduced, to full pay. And here I am afraid the under&s;tandings of our profe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t appear dreadfully low, when they can be dupes to the hopes of promotion.</P>
<P>Let them reflect for a moment on the mode of be&s;tow|ing, &s;ince the peace, the only commi&s;&s;ions which by mi|litary men can be e&s;teemed objects; I mean regiments, and lieutenant colonelcies; and I will venture to affirm, that not four of each have been be&s;towed on men who, in the opinion of tho&s;e who have &s;erved with them, have the &s;emblance of a title. That the army on the Engli&s;h and on the Iri&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the fleet on the home and foreign &s;tations, have been con&s;idered by our court as the precious means of corrupting us from our duty as citizens; that a plea of merit in general, or any par|ticular action, of wounds, lo&s;s of health or limbs by a cour&s;e of hard &s;ervices, has been con&s;idered as a &s;ymptom of lunacy. And I have heard &s;ay, our incomparable Secre|tary at War values him&s;elf not a little for his humanity, in not &s;uing for &s;tatutes to confine the wretches who can pu&s;h their extravagance to &s;uch a height as to make the&s;e pleas. It will perhaps be &s;aid, that jobs are not the growth of this reign; that jobs ever were, and ever will be, in a government like ours. But allowing jobs to have been, I cannot think iniquity is to be ju&s;tifyed by precedent, and &s;urely iniquitous precedents are very un|gracefully quoted in a reign which was announced from its commencement to be that of virtue, purity, and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the army that &s;erved in Germany, it is true they have not been &s;o very gro&s;sly treated as the American. There were moments when Lord Granby would not cede to our gracious Secretary at War. There were moments when, as our ingenious court termed it, he was ob&s;tinate and impracticable; that is, there were moments when he in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ome regard being paid to

tho&s;e who had de&s;erved of their country; but the&s;e mo|ments unfortunately occurred but too &s;eldom. His faci|lity and complacence to the wickedne&s;s of the Court, preponderated over his natural love of ju&s;tice. In &s;hort, the patronage of the army was left to a Barrington, by whom valour, &s;en&s;e and integrity mu&s;t naturally be pro|&s;cribed, as he mu&s;t &s;u&s;pect that no man can po&s;&s;e&s;s them without being an enemy to their contraries, which are the undi&s;puted attributes of his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>From this long digre&s;&s;ion on the obligations of the ar|my to the pre&s;ent Court, on the extraordinary e&s;teem in which the military has been held through the whole cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent reign, we returned to our original topic, the merit of the different hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>I joined the young &s;ubaltern in his encomiums on Mrs. M'Cawley. I challenged the old field-officer to point out a &s;u&s;picious authority that &s;he had quoted; to pro|duce a &s;ingle comment which did not corre&s;pond with the facts. I a&s;&s;erted, that her inferences were fairly drawn from her premi&s;es; and that there could not be traced the &s;hadow of partiality in the long &s;eries of her hi&s;tory, unle&s;s a zeal for true liberty, and the rights of her coun|try and of mankind, may be termed partiality. I a&s;&s;er|ted, that Hume was the rever&s;e in all re&s;pects; that he produced little, and that very &s;u&s;picious, authority; that his comments did not agree whith his facts, the effects not deducible from the cau&s;e. Upon the whole, what I &s;aid on the &s;ubject of James's hi&s;tory, and of the charac|ter of his favourite Charles, was &s;o &s;atisfactory to the company, that they reque&s;ted me to dige&s;t what I offer|ed, and to pre&s;ent it to the public.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN reading hi&s;tory, nothing has &s;o frequently &s;hocked me as the di&s;re&s;pectful and irreverent manner in which divers writers have &s;poke of crowned heads. Ma|ny princes, it mu&s;t be owned, have acted, in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces,

not altogether as we could wi&s;h; but it is the duty of every hone&s;t man, and friend to royalty, the great &s;ource of human happine&s;s, to draw a veil over their weakne&s;s; and if not able entirely to ju&s;tify &s;ome parts of their conduct, he may at lea&s;t, by the aid of certain <HI>managed terms,</HI> and <HI>decent &s;oftenings,</HI> in a great mea&s;ure prevent the evil effects which a coar&s;e, and I may &s;ay barbarous relation of facts is apt to have on weak and vulgar minds. The pa&s;&s;ion, prejudice, and party heat of &s;everal who &s;tyle them&s;elves hi&s;torians, have, I make no doubt, been the principal cau&s;es of the numberle&s;s mur|murs, in&s;urrections, rebellions, dethronements, expul&s;i|ons, regicides, which have di&s;graced the hi&s;tory of man|kind, and more particularly of this infatuated country.</P>
<P>On this principle, Sir, you will readily believe, that the &s;atisfaction I have received from your incomparable Hi&s;tory of the Hou&s;e of the Stuarts, is of the highe&s;t kind; that I have peru&s;ed it, and re-peru&s;ed it a thou&s;and times, and always with fre&s;h plea&s;ure; and that I ar|dently wi&s;h the youth of our country were never &s;uffered to read any other; a rule which I am charmed to hear is ob&s;erved by the mo&s;t exalted per&s;onage in the kingdom, as well in virtue as in rank, whenever he conde&s;cends to unbend his mind from his &s;evere &s;tudies and occupations by dipping into the annals of his predece&s;&s;ors; and it is to this rule, perhaps, that we are indebted for the prodigious enlargement of his mind, in &s;o tender an age that all Eu|rope &s;tands a&s;toni&s;hed at it.</P>
<P>How complai&s;ant, how gentle, how guarded, how humane, how polite are your phra&s;es, in laying before us the tran&s;actions of tho&s;e good, though perhaps mi&s;|guided, princes! How calculated are your comments to mitigate the &s;editious &s;pirit of the mad multitude! Had you written an hundred years ago, I am per&s;uaded you would not only have prevented the growth of tho&s;e horri|ble opinions, (alas! too prevalent) That kings are not only re&s;pon&s;ible, but puni&s;hable for their delinquencies toward their people; that Charles the Fir&s;t met with no harder fate than he de&s;erved, and that his two &s;ons

I &s;ay, Sir, had you written an hundred years ago, you might not only have prevented the growth of &s;uch mon&s;trous notions, but, probably, have checked tho&s;e furious prin|ciples, which ended in driving from the throne of his an|ce&s;tors, to the indelible di&s;grace of the&s;e nations, a prince replete with every royal virtue.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir, I am &s;o much in love with the &s;cheme of your hi&s;tory, I am &s;o convinced that no ta&s;k can be equally laudable in a philo&s;opher, an hi&s;torian, and a gentleman, as to endeavour to eradicate from the minds of our youth all prejudices and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t the memory of decea&s;ed, and the character of living princes; and, by obviating the cavils and malice of republican writers, to in&s;pire mankind with more candour in judg|ing of the actions and government of &s;overeigns, that I am determined to follow &s;o bright an example, and ex|ert the utmo&s;t of my zeal, &s;kill, and abilities (indeed far &s;hort of yours) to re&s;cue from the unmerited odium under which they lie, two much injured characters in hi&s;tory; I mean the Emperor Claudius Cae&s;ar, and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or Nero, who&s;e foibles and indi&s;creti|ons have been &s;welled up into vices, by the au&s;terity and malevolence of Tacitus, Suetonius, and others (the Rapins, Ludlows, and M'Cawleys of tho&s;e days) who wrote under &s;ucceeding monarchs of a different family; but as the motives for &s;uch virulent proceedings are now cea&s;ed, and as men's minds ought to be a little cooler, we may venture to pronounce the di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e princes (though I do not think they were faultle&s;s, or altogether well-advi&s;ed) to have been good.</P>
<P>Should the ungenerous and bigots in party rai&s;e a cla|mour, &s;hould they exclaim that its being a pander to de&s;poti&s;m, and an enemy to the rights of humanity, the endeavouring to glo&s;s over vices and enormities &s;o ma|nife&s;t, as they pretend, by a concurrence of facts, vouched by the mo&s;t authentic records, I &s;hall con&s;ole my&s;elf, Sir, with your approbation, and that of the ge|nerous few who think with you, and &s;hall flatter my&s;elf

<HEAD>A POLITICAL ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>ON leaving &s;chool, I thought it right to get &s;ome acquaintance with the hi&s;tory of England; for the &s;chool where I was brought up was guilty, in com|mon with all other &s;chools, of the &s;hameful neglect of &s;uffering the boys to remain in utter ignorance of the laws, con&s;titution, and tran&s;actions of their own country; &s;ome knowledge of which is certainly of more import|ance, at lea&s;t in a government like ours, than the being able to &s;can the flattering ver&s;ifyers of Augu&s;tus's age.</P>
<P>Rapin, accidentally, was the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t hi&s;torian that fell into my hands. Notwith&s;tanding his length, I read him through with great attention, which was more particu|larly engaged when I came to tho&s;e parts which treat of our &s;everal civil wars; but the great one of the year 1640, intere&s;ted me more &s;en&s;ibly than the antecedent. And I cannot expre&s;s how much I was amazed in find|ing the character of Charles the Fir&s;t &s;o little agree with the notions I had conceived of him, from his being &s;tyled a Martyr; from the &s;olemn ob&s;ervance of the 30th of January, in order to avert the wrath of the Almighty for that horrible parricide; from the epithets of good, vir|tuous, pious, ble&s;&s;ed, which were perpetually be&s;towed on him, not only by the old hou&s;e-keeper, the maid-&s;er|vants, but by the ma&s;ter, u&s;her, and all the clergy who happened to di&s;cour&s;e on this &s;ubject in my hearing. In the holidays, when we went home, my mother, grand|mother, and all their female acquaintance, rung the &s;ame in my ears.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="024456_0084_0FC7357EB82DD218">On the peru&s;al of Rapin I was, therefore, &s;trangely puzzled and confounded to find this virtuous, pious, ble&s;&s;ed, holy martyr, metamorpho&s;ed into an ob&s;tinate, di&s;&s;embling, perfidious tyrant; and that the men whom I had been taught to execrate as rebels, traytors, parri|cides, &s;hould, for the greater part, appear the champi|ons of the laws of their country and the rights of man|kind, fraught with truth, valour, integrity, and every attribute which can render mortal men the objects of veneration.</P>
<P>I had no method of accounting for this, but by con|cluding my hi&s;torian guilty of the mo&s;t egregious parti|ality, that he mu&s;t have mi&s;tated, or di&s;gui&s;ed the facts to an enormous degree; for as to his comments, they appeared judicious, natural and fair, allowing the facts to be ju&s;tly &s;tated. I de&s;ired all tho&s;e whom I thought more knowing and wi&s;e than my&s;elf, to &s;olve the&s;e diffi|culties. Some few of them averred that Charles was not at all better than what he was repre&s;ented by Rapin; but far the greater number a&s;&s;ured me, that Rapin was a lying French Pre&s;byterian, partial, unju&s;t, mali|cious, that no credit was given to him by men of judg|ment and knowledge, and that he was never &s;poke of with common patience by tho&s;e who have any generous &s;entiments. They advi&s;ed me, by all means, to go to the fountain-head of information on this &s;ubject, the <HI>great Clarendon;</HI> that <HI>there</HI> I &s;hould &s;ee the facts related clear|ly and hone&s;tly, the comments &s;en&s;ible and candid, the cau&s;es and effects congruous, the &s;pring of every action laid open, the views and characters of the actors pain|ted in their proper colours, by one who had him&s;elf played a principal part, or, at lea&s;t, &s;een every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed behind the &s;cenes; one, who&s;e authority was in|conte&s;tible from his character for truth and integrity.</P>
<P>I accordingly procured a Clarendon, not only read him with attention, but &s;tudied him with accuracy: and, behold the re&s;ult! it was an entire, complete di&s;appoint|ment in every circum&s;tance: in&s;tead of carrying the conviction which I expected, it appeared to me one
<PB N="78" REF="024456_0085_0FC735874BB14940">
eternal periphra&s;is &s;ubdivided into a&s;&s;ertions without au|thority, childi&s;h ifs without probable &s;uppo&s;itions, and tortured inferences from mi&s;tated or defalcated facts, with endle&s;s begging the que&s;tions. The epithets can|did, &s;incere, virtuous, pious, were very liberally be&s;towed on him, who&s;e cau&s;e he intends to plead; and not a &s;ingle in&s;tance of candor, &s;incerity, or virtue is given through the whole cour&s;e of his hi&s;tory, unle&s;s exce&s;&s;ive bigotry to epi&s;copacy, and a &s;pirit of per&s;ecuting all other prote&s;tant &s;ects, is to be con&s;trued piety. In &s;hort, my aver&s;ion to Charles was rather confirmed than transfer|red to the other party by the peru&s;al of Lord Clarendon. I here di&s;cerned very plainly, why the epi&s;copal clergy &s;hould have made a Saint and a Martyr of him. His exce&s;&s;ive attachment to their order, and the great &s;acrifi|ces he made to them, are undoubtedly very &s;ub&s;tantial titles to canonization, and the crown of martyrdom; but the zeal and reverence with which a multitude of others, who are quite indifferent to modes of wor&s;hip, and &s;ome who &s;eem de&s;irous there &s;hould be none at all, &s;till con|tinue to &s;peak of this prince, and the indignation and horror with which they &s;peak of his opponents, I con|fe&s;s is with me a matter of wonder. I know very well, that the impre&s;&s;ions we receive in our childhood &s;ink deep, and that the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, whether we receive them from our nur&s;es, grandmother, or the par&s;on of the pa|ri&s;h; whether they concern gho&s;ts, or hobgoblins, a de|vil, or a &s;aint, a tyrant, or a martyr, are with difficulty effaced; but that tho&s;e who have got rid of tho&s;e nar|row &s;uper&s;titious prejudices, &s;hould &s;till retain, in their utmo&s;t force, their prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions with re&s;pect to their royal ma&s;ter, is &s;omething &s;upernatural. I have long endeavoured to account for this, and am apt to conclude, that it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the &s;ingularity of his fate.&mdash; A king tried and condemned by his own &s;ubjects is cer|tainly a &s;ingular ca&s;e, the &s;ingularity of his fate has cre|ated pity, and pity ever generates love and affection.&mdash; The Marquis of Beccaria, in his incomparable treati&s;e on Crimes and Puni&s;hments, is of opinion, that a com|munity
<PB N="79" REF="024456_0086_0FC73589427ECB40">
ought to puni&s;h with death &s;uch criminals only who&s;e exi&s;tence is ab&s;olutely pernicious to the communi|ty; if his rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, a criminal king is almo&s;t the only criminal on whom death ought to be inflicted, as his exi&s;tence (if not always ab&s;olutely de&s;tructive) is un|doubtedly highly dangerous to &s;ociety. Tarquin was only expelled; Tarquin's exi&s;tence was nearly de&s;truc|tive to Rome; an eternal war and con&s;piracies within the walls, which brought Rome into the extreme&s;t peril, were the con&s;equences of the tyrant's exi&s;tence; and the death of the tyrant <HI>&s;imply,</HI> unle&s;s it hath been accompa|nied with that of his &s;ons, would not have injured the tranquillity and &s;ecurity of Rome.</P>
<P>On this principle, &s;ome of the Grecian States had laws levelled, not only again&s;t the lives of tho&s;e who &s;hould erect them&s;elves into the tyrans of their country, but enjoining the extirpation of their whole race; and the&s;e were wi&s;e and humane laws, becau&s;e they were ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the good of the whole, for the &s;acrifice of a &s;ingle family for the pre&s;ervation of millions is indi&s;puta|bly humanity. James the &s;econd was expelled like Tar|quin, but he and his &s;ons were &s;uffered to e&s;cape with their lives; the con&s;equences of their being &s;uffered to e&s;cape were three rebellions, which not only threatened immediate de&s;truction to the&s;e nations, but endangered the liberties of Europe. It is true, the&s;e rebellions were defeated in their immediate purpo&s;es, but the exi&s;tence of the Stuart race hath laid, too certainly, I am afraid, the &s;eeds of our de&s;truction. Their exi&s;tence has furni&s;hed the mini&s;ters of the family, which was called in for our pre&s;ervation, with pretexts for arming the family of <HI>our pre&s;ervers,</HI> with the means of de&s;troying us; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that the nation could have been brought to acquie&s;ce in mortgaging the national proper|ty, without any vi&s;ible national purpo&s;es, unle&s;s they had imagined that national debts were a &s;ecurity again&s;t the return of the <HI>dreaded Stuarts</HI>; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that the people could have been &s;o far impo&s;ed upon, as to &s;uffer their repre&s;entatives to vote
<PB N="80" REF="024456_0087_0FC7358B0E5C9320">
them&s;elves &s;eptennial from triennial, unle&s;s they had been per&s;uaded, that a &s;eptennial parliament formed a &s;tronger barrier again&s;t the return of the Stuarts than a triennial; and it is &s;till a greater ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e, that a majority of landed gentlemen, of really well mean|ing hone&s;t Engli&s;hmen, could be infatuated, to &s;o great a degree, as to &s;it down contentedly under the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a &s;tanding army, the gradual augmentation of it to an enormous bulk, the interweaving of it (as it may be &s;aid) into our con&s;titution, had not the &s;pectre of the Stu|arts return continually danced before their eyes. Hence, I think, without &s;training, it may be inferred, that the pecuniary influence of the crown, &s;eptennial parliaments and a &s;tanding army, (which unle&s;s &s;ome great national calamity falls out to draw us back to our fir&s;t principles, before the minds of our &s;oldiery are totally debauched) mu&s;t inevitably end in the de&s;truction of our liberties; and perhaps national independence, have been the fruits of our mi&s;taken cruel moderation, in &s;uffering a &s;ingle individual of the expelled family to remain in exi&s;tence. But to return from this long digre&s;&s;ion to the que&s;tion, whether the &s;ingularity of Charles the Fir&s;t's fate, tryed and condemned by his own &s;ubjects, is not one of the principal cau&s;es of his memory's being treated with &s;uch tenderne&s;s and reverence. We will &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e; but fir&s;t admitting Beccaria's po&s;ition to be ju&s;t, <HI>that a com|munity ought not to puni&s;h with death any criminal who&s;e exi&s;tence is not ab&s;olutely pernicious, or highly dangerous to the community;</HI> and further, admitting <HI>that a criminal king is the only criminal who&s;e exi&s;tence can be pernicious or highly dangerous.</HI> We will &s;uppo&s;e, then, that there &s;hould hereafter be formed a community, one of who&s;e fundamental laws &s;hould be, That capital puni&s;hments &s;hould be confined to delinquent kings alone; that all other delinquents, let their crimes be what they will, &s;hould be &s;ent into exile; their e&s;tates, money, and goods con|fi&s;cated to the u&s;e of the community. I will venture to affirm, that an hundred kings, le&s;s guilty than Charles the Fir&s;t, put to death on the &s;caffold, would not &s;hock the humanity of the tendere&s;t nature.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="024456_0088_0FC7358D4C552290">We will farther &s;uppo&s;e, that after a &s;eries of years adherence to this law, they &s;hould at length, from a con|currence of accidents, on &s;ome very great emergency, de|viate from it, and inflict the puni&s;hment levelled again&s;t royal delinquents alone, on delinquents of an inferior order, I will venture to affirm that the &s;pectacle, from its novelty, of a Jonathan Wild, a S&mdash;h, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> * * *, dangling on a gallows, would affect the pa&s;&s;ers-by with compa&s;&s;ion, and prompt their ingenuity to devi&s;e apolo|gies for the <HI>poor &s;ufferers</HI>; though, previou&s;ly to their execution, the whole world had agreed on the tran&s;cen|dency of their flagitiou&s;ne&s;s, the incorrigibility of their natures, and that no fate could be too &s;evere for their merits. But although the &s;ingularity of Charles's de&s;tiny, the prejudices fo&s;tered by the pious care of our nur&s;es and the clergy, have greatly contributed to the fal&s;e light in which his conduct, morals, and general character are &s;een, it could not have operated &s;o wonderfully alone: the addre&s;s and &s;ophi&s;try of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our corrupt citizens have been &s;et at work, to co-operate in mi&s;lead|ing our judgment and blinding our under&s;tandings; and of this tribe the pre-eminence mu&s;t indi&s;putably be given to Mr. David Hume; for the pompous anility (as I think it may be termed) of Clarendon, the more than prie&s;tly fury of Carte, much le&s;s the pert patch work of Smollet, or the drivelling of poor Gold&s;mith, could not have brought any mighty miracles; but with Hume, the ca&s;e is different; the philo&s;ophical, or rather &s;ceptical charac|ter of the man antecedent to his appearance as an hi&s;|torian, and a &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;tyle render him &s;o infinitely more dangerous than his fellow labourers, that it is much to be lamented that &s;ome per&s;on (for in&s;tance, a Lord Littelton) eminent for parts and learning, has not thought it worth his while profe&s;&s;edly (but I would have it com|pendiou&s;ly, for a rea&s;on I &s;hall hereafter give) to expo&s;e to public view the incongruities, artifices, and pernicious intention of this &s;ophi&s;t. But when I lament that no man of a &s;uperior &s;tamp has &s;et him&s;elf the ta&s;k, I do not mean that extraordinary learning or talents are ab&s;olutely

nece&s;&s;ary: on the contrary, I think an attentive peru&s;al mu&s;t qualify every man of common &s;en&s;e full as well for the purpo&s;e, if we could &s;uppo&s;e that an equal degree of regard would be paid to him; but it is certain, that the name and &s;ignature of a per&s;on in high repute gives, to manife&s;t eternal truths, greater force than when uttered by a common or unknown writer, although the e&s;&s;ence of truth cannot be altered by the greater or le&s;&s;er reputa|tion of him who utters it.</P>
<P>It is true, a more effectual antidote to the poi&s;on of Hume's hi&s;tory cannot be de&s;ired than Mrs. M'Cawley's, if they are but read and compared together with their re&s;pective authorities; but the misfortue is, the peru&s;al and comparing of two &s;o bulky writers cannot be ex|pected from the lazine&s;s of modern readers; and it is on the notions and principles of the lazy cla&s;s of readers that the pre&s;ent welfare of our country and the fate of po&s;terity, in a great mea&s;ure, depend. In fact, of what importance would it be to the community, if tho&s;e very few, who have inclination and per&s;everance to work through volumes, &s;hould enlarge their minds to even the &s;tandard of an ancient Roman, when the young no|bility, gentry, and men of property, who compo&s;e the lazy cla&s;s, &s;till remain perverted, uncorrected, an unin|formed?</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I think that &s;ome works &s;o compen|dious as not to terrify by its bulk, confined &s;imply, and bearing the import of &s;uch in its title, to a refutation of Hume's tenets, and demon&s;tration of his partiality and pernicious principles, would be more beneficial than a full, complete body of hi&s;tory, dige&s;ted methodically, &s;upported by the be&s;t authority, and animated by the no|ble&s;t &s;entiments. But until &s;ome eminent per&s;on will be per&s;uaded to take up the employment, it is the duty of every common citizen to exert whatever force he has in the common cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>BREAKFAST</HI> FOR R********.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. H&mdash;,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS Mr. R&mdash; has given the public to under|&s;tand, that he does not chu&s;e to deal with any writers, but tho&s;e of the mo&s;t accurate and elegant kind, and who have pa&s;&s;ed through a regular cour&s;e of educa|tion; and as I cannot flatter my&s;elf, that I am one of this cla&s;s, I do not pre&s;ume to offer this little perform|ance to him, though it is intended for his vindication; but, as I under&s;tand, from the &s;ame authority, that you admit into your paper even the lowe&s;t tra&s;h, I find my&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to you. Mr. R&mdash; has I know, like other great men, his calumni|ators and enemies;&mdash;envy and malice ever were attend|ant on exalted genius and merit. It is inconceivable, what numbers are endeavouring to detract from this wonderful per&s;onage; how they &s;train their little wits to throw a ridicule upon his talents, his &s;tyle, his inte|grity, and even his erudition. This <HI>la&s;t,</HI> one &s;hould ima|gine, if any thing of human attainment can, is unque&s;|tionable, as he has given &s;uch eminent and manifold proofs of it: however it does not e&s;cape them. I found my&s;elf the other night (for as a &s;tudier of men and cha|racters I a&s;&s;ociate with all &s;orts) among&s;t a &s;et of the mo&s;t flaming factious enemies to all order and govern|ment; where the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters of the age were treated with &s;candalous freedom.

was a Jeffries, Lord Bute a &s;olemn, empty, pedantic Ja|cobite, and Mr. R&mdash; a ridiculous, pragmatical, &s;lip|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">op coxcomb: they &s;aid, that he had not decency enough for the porter of a bawdy-hou&s;e, learning enough for a barrack wa&s;her-woman, nor imagination &s;ufficient for a Chri&s;tmas-bellman:&mdash;that at the age of fifteen he was turned out of the blue-&s;chool, where he had been bred, as too incorrigible a dunce to make a &s;cavenger of; that they had, by way of jocular experiment, for &s;ome time tried him in this capacity; but that he always, in windy days, &s;wept the du&s;t up again&s;t the wind. By per&s;i&s;ting in this practice he was very near lo&s;ing his eyes, and that you may ob&s;erve they are &s;till extremely weak from its effects. At this, Sir, I own my blood boiled. I &s;aid, they mu&s;t be driven to great &s;traits indeed, if they could object nothing wor&s;e to a gentleman's character than his having been bred at a charity-&s;chool; for that it had been the ca&s;e of &s;ome of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious men the nation had produced; the late Lord Hardwicke, and Mr. Prior, had been educated in the &s;ame manner. As to the &s;tory of the weakne&s;s of his eyes, proceeding from &s;weeping the du&s;t again&s;t the wind, I know it to be a fal&s;hood; for that it had been contracted, to my know|ledge, by poring into a John&s;on's dictionary of his own printing, late at nights, to find out decent poly&s;yllables, of &s;ufficient &s;ound and dignity, to dre&s;s up an adverti&s;e|ment of Scotch herrings, lumber, and pickled oy&s;ters.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;erted, that his compo&s;itions were incomprehen&s;i|bly fine, his language &s;onorious and mu&s;ical; although, perhaps, he did not always apply words to their legiti|mate meaning; as who does in &s;uch an immen&s;ity of bu&s;ine&s;s; and that he &s;hould round a period with any book&s;eller in Chri&s;tendom: That he was a Latin &s;cholar, I thought mu&s;t be allowed by all unprejudiced men, when they con&s;idered his numberle&s;s and apt quotations from Horace. Upon my mentioning his knowledge of Latin, the whole company bur&s;t out into a hor&s;e-laugh, which I thought was very indecent, and, when the up|roar &s;ub&s;ided, demanded the explanation. They in&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="86" REF="024456_0093_0FC735A21EEDDCA8">
upon it, that he was &s;o totally ignorant of it, that he did not know the meaning, nor could he conjugate the verbs <HI>mentior,</HI> nor <HI>vapulo,</HI> though he &s;o generally practi&s;ed the former, and has &s;o often experienced the latter:&mdash;that his patches of Horace were always furni&s;hed by his friend the Doctor&mdash;that when he had fini&s;hed one of his pie|ces, he always applied to the Doctor for a motto to dig|nify his performance; that, for in&s;tance, the four lines from Horace, prefixed to his late Epi&s;tle to Mr. Sears, (which I really think one of the &s;marte&s;t things I ever read) were pointed out by the Doctor; and that a blun|der whim&s;ical enough happened on this occa&s;ion, though it was fortunately rectified in time for the pre&s;s. They related, that when he went as u&s;ual for his motto to the Doctor, the Doctor wrote him down the&s;e lines:
<Q><L>While you alone &s;u&s;tain the weighty cares</L>
<L>Of all the world, and manage peace and wars;</L>
<L>The Roman State by virtue's rules amend,</L>
<L>Adorn with manners, and with arms defend;</L>
<L>To write a long di&s;cour&s;e, and wa&s;te your time,</L>
<L>Again&s;t the public good, wou'd be a crime.</L></Q>
&s;aying, "R&mdash; you may tran&s;cribe the Latin at your lei&s;ure, as you have Horace in your &s;hop; remember, it is the fir&s;t epi&s;tle." R&mdash; went home va&s;tly hap|py, but unluckily mi&s;took the fir&s;t &s;atire for the fir&s;t epi&s;|tle. When the Doctor went to revi&s;e it the next morn|ing, he found the&s;e lines very fairly written&mdash;<HI>Qui fit Maecenas ut nemo quam,</HI> &amp;c. and under, the above tran&s;|lation. They added, that though the Doctor was that morning in an horrible ill humour (as he had ju&s;t been reading the Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph's &s;peech) he could not refrain from laughing; but, however, after having be|&s;towed &s;ome anathemas on the &s;kull of his friend, he, for the honour of the common cau&s;e, took the pains to tran&s;|cribe the lines with his own hand, to prevent any further blunders. They then proceeded to fall foul upon his Engli&s;h; they &s;aid that when he fir&s;t &s;et up his pre&s;s, and before he was under the correction of the Doctor, he u&s;ed always to write mu&s;keteers, mu&s;k-cat-ears&mdash;dra|goons,
<PB N="87" REF="024456_0094_0FC735A37A9D0140">
dragons&mdash;battalions, battle lions; and that he really thought the&s;e &s;trange things were made u&s;e of in war; that all the words ending in <HI>tion,</HI> as <HI>flaggellation, ca&s;tigation, &s;alivation,</HI> words he is be&s;t acquainted with, he &s;pelt with an <HI>&s;h.</HI> I hate the &s;tory they told of him, which, although I was cur&s;edly enraged, I confe&s;s made me &s;mile; that writing to his niece, who was going to be married to an eminent pawnbroker in St. Martin's Lane, he began his letter thus: "My dear Kitty, as you are going to be married, and are &s;o very young a girl, I would advi&s;e you by all means, at lea&s;t, at fir&s;t, to act with a little <HI>cu&s;hion,"</HI> meaning it for <HI>caution.</HI> Now I would appeal to all mankind, who are not totally blinded by party and faction, whether it is credible, whether it is po&s;&s;ible, that a gentleman, who has from his cradle been in &s;ome &s;ort a retainer of the Mu&s;es, &s;hould be guilty of &s;uch gro&s;s, &s;uch ridiculous blunders. When I &s;ay Mr. R&mdash; has been a retainer of the Mu&s;es, I do not mean, Sir, in your paltry &s;phere, a mere dealer in indexes and title pages. No, Sir, his &s;phere has been more en|larged. It is notorious, that when he had fini&s;hed his &s;tudies, he was invited into a &s;ociety of eminent intinera|ry comedians; I know very well, that his enemies give out, that he only amputated the luminaries betwixt the acts; but I could bring authentic proofs of his di&s;tin|gui&s;hing him&s;elf in &s;ome important characters.</P>

<P>A PAMPHLET, entitled, <HI>A friendly Addre&s;s to all rea&s;onable Americans,</HI> adverti&s;ed and &s;old by Mr. James Rivington, of New-York, is of &s;o extraordinary a nature, that it is difficult for any man who is intere&s;ted in the welfare of the community (whatever contempt he may have for the performance) to remain &s;ilent. I know not whether the author is a layman or eccle&s;ia&s;tic, but he bears &s;trongly the characters of the latter: he has the want of candour and truth, the apparent &s;pirit of per&s;ecution, the unforgivene&s;s, the deadly hatred to di&s;|&s;enters, and the zeal for arbitrary <HI>power</HI> which has di&s;|tingui&s;hed churchmen in all ages, and more particularly the high part of the Church of England. I cannot help, therefore, con&s;idering him as one of this order.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of his Reverence's pamphlet, is manife&s;tly to di&s;&s;olve the &s;pirit of union, and check the noble ar|dour, prevailing through the continent; but his zeal &s;o far outruns his abilities, that there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on
<PB N="89" REF="024456_0096_0FC735A68965A3C0">
to think that he has laboured to little effect. His di&s;cre|tion &s;eems to be &s;till le&s;s than his genius; a man of com|mon judgment would not &s;o wantonly have attacked the general reigning principle and opinions of the people, whom he intends to intimidate or &s;educe out of their rights and privileges. For in&s;tance, I believe there are at lea&s;t ninety-nine Americans in a hundred, who think that Charles the Fir&s;t was an execrable tyrant; that he met with no harder fate than he de&s;erved; and that his two &s;ons ought, in ju&s;tice, to have made the &s;ame exit.</P>
<P>To de&s;cant, therefore, on the criminality of the re&s;i&s;t|ance made to that tyrant; to affect, on every occa&s;ion, giving the title of rebellion to the civil war which brought him to ju&s;tice, is a degree of weakne&s;s which no man who is not blinded by the daemon of Jacobiti&s;m could po&s;&s;ibly be guilty of. But to preach up in this enlight|ened age, as he does in almo&s;t expre&s;s terms, pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience, is a mark of lunacy, or at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t it proves that the moment a head begins to itch for a mitre, it lo&s;es the faculty of rea&s;oning; for if the principle of pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience is admitted, the gracious prince, for whom his Reverence profe&s;&s;es &s;o great a devotion, is a downright u&s;urper, and the parliament, of which he &s;peaks &s;o re&s;|pectfully, Lords and Commons, are rebels and traitors.</P>
<P>The doctrines he aims to inculcate are as follows: "That the parliament has a right to tax you without your con&s;ent; that the duty upon tea is no tax; that this duty is your only grievance; that the cau&s;e of Bo&s;|ton is their own concern; that it is not your cau&s;e; that the puni&s;hment of Bo&s;ton is a ju&s;t puni&s;hment; that it is lenient; that it is not equal to their crimes; that the Bo&s;tonians are rebels, traitors, and pampered fanatics; that the Congre&s;s are little better; that no mi&s;conduct of admini&s;tration can ju&s;tify or excu&s;e open di&s;re&s;pect; that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is to be paid to the higher powers, what|ever character they be; that an apo&s;tle enjoined &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the tyrant Nero; that of all people under hea|ven, the king's American &s;ubjects have the lea&s;t cau&s;e for complaint; that the pre&s;ent confu&s;ion of the Colo|nies

have been occa&s;ioned by fal&s;e alarms; that none of your legal rights have been invaded; no injury has been done you; and, con&s;equently, that you can never be ju&s;tified in re&s;enting that of which you have no rea&s;on to complain; that you are no judges of the rights of Parliament; that the Parliament ought to act according to their own judgment, not according to yours, even in things which concern you principally or &s;olely; that they a&s;&s;ert they have the right in que&s;tion; that you have never proved they have not; that you have always be|lieved or allowed they have, until the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; that the Quebec Bill is a ju&s;t and con&s;titutional bill; that the Canadians are likely to prove the be&s;t and mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects in his Maje&s;ty's American dominions; that there is too much rea&s;on to believe, that the minds of the Americans are unprincipled, and their hearts di&s;po|&s;ed for rebellion; that, &s;ince the reduction of Canada, they have been bloated with a vain opinion of their own power and importance; that the i&s;land of Great Britain is able to govern (that is, to dragoon) ten Americans; that the moment it is known that America is no longer under the protection of Great Britain, all the maritime powers of Europe would join to ravage your &s;ea-ports, plunder and &s;eize your &s;hips, merely for the plea&s;ure of ravaging; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is perhaps the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous idea that ever was hatched in a di&s;tempered brain. America (more particularly &s;ince the di&s;trac|tions in Poland have taken place) has been the great granary, or <HI>cella penaria</HI> of Europe. Is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive, that the different mari|time powers &s;hould unite to deprive them&s;elves of the chief means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, merely for the fun's &s;ake? Is it not more natural to &s;up|po&s;e, that they would outbid each other for your friend&s;hip and com|merce, on which &s;o much depends? When the Low Countries with|drew them&s;elves from the dominion of Spain, did England, France, and the other powers, immediately &s;et about ravaging their &s;ea-ports and &s;eizing their &s;hips? Did they not, on the contrary, exert them&s;elves, directly and indirectly, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them? The ca&s;e is &s;imilar; the event would be &s;imilar, and that Great Britain would not be powerful enough at &s;ea, when &s;eparated from her colonies, to prevent this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall refer my readers to Ma&s;&s;ie's E&s;timates, the authority of which has never been di&s;puted, and which demon&s;trate that more than half the naval power of Great Britain &s;tands on her American foundation.</NOTE> that all the maritime powers of the world

All his po&s;itions, indeed, are &s;o &s;elf-evidently ab&s;urd and fal&s;e, that it would be an in&s;ult to American under&s;tanding, &s;eriou&s;ly to attempt refuting them. I &s;hall only beg leave to take notice of the curi|ous argument he u&s;es to prove the duty on tea to be no tax: it is, that <HI>unle&s;s we con&s;ent to the tax, we are not to pay the duty; we may refu&s;e purcha&s;ing it if we plea&s;e.</HI> The &s;ame logic would demon&s;trate that a duty on beer, candles, or &s;oap, would be no tax: as we are not ab&s;o|lutely obliged to drink beer, we may drink water; we may go to bed before it is dark, and we are not forced to wa&s;h our &s;hirts. His a&s;&s;ertion that Great Britain, when divorced from her colonies, will &s;till hold the em|pire of the &s;eas, in &s;pite of all the powers of the world, is &s;till more ingenious. It amounts to this, <HI>that without the po&s;&s;ible means of procuring timber, iron, planks, ma&s;ts, pitch, tar, or hemp, to furni&s;h out a &s;ingle frigate, they may build more &s;hips than all the world put together; that when her nur&s;ery for &s;eamen is de&s;troyed, and all the com|merce on which the exi&s;tence of &s;eamen depends is annihila|ted, they will then be able to man more fleets than the whole univer&s;e put together.</HI> But I am a&s;hamed of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the public patience, in making &s;trictures on &s;uch ri|diculous articles; I &s;hall therefore pa&s;s to &s;ome que&s;tions which have not been &s;o much agitated, and on which, if I mi&s;take not, his Reverence lays the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s; for, as he mode&s;tly declares, that he has no opinion of your courage, it was natural for him to con&s;ider intimi|dation and terror, as the mo&s;t powerful figures of rheto|ric. <HI>Regular armies from Great Britain, He&s;&s;ians, Hano|verians, royal &s;tandards erected, &s;kilful generals, legions of Canadians, and unnumbered tribes of &s;avages, &s;words fla|ming in the front and rear, pe&s;tilence, de&s;olation, and fa|mine,</HI> are all mar&s;halled in a mo&s;t dreadful order by this

church militant author. But let us &s;omewhat minutely examine the picture, and &s;ee whether, &s;tripped of its fal&s;e colouring, it has any thing really terrifying. His Reverence begins with a&s;&s;uring us, that there is no room to doubt but that &s;uch an army as was employed in the reduction of Canada (that is, an army of 7000 men) would be more than &s;ufficient for the conque&s;t of all the di&s;affected American colonies, which are, in fact, all the colonies, &s;hould <HI>&s;uch</HI> a re&s;olution become nece&s;&s;ary in order to reduce them to obedience. For my own part, I think there is a very great rea&s;on to doubt that 7000, even of the be&s;t troops, are able to conquer 200,000 of the mo&s;t di&s;orderly pea&s;antry upon earth, if they are ani|mated in defence of every thing they hold mo&s;t dear and &s;acred; and there is &s;till greater rea&s;on to doubt that 7000 very indifferent troops, compo&s;ed of the refu&s;e of an exhau&s;ted nation, few of whom have &s;een action of any kind, &s;hould be able to conquer 200,000 active, vi|gorous yeomanry, &s;ired with the noble ardour we &s;ee prevalent through the continent, all armed, all expert in the u&s;e of arms, almo&s;t from their cradles. The &s;ucce&s;s of Quebec, it is true, does infinite honour to the Engli&s;h arms; the army was, I believe, only 7000; the enemy were perhaps more than double, but 16,000 men are not 200,000. The fate of Canada depended upon one de|ci&s;ive action, but it is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate how many victories mu&s;t be gained before the Colonies could be &s;ubdued; whereas a &s;ingle victory gained by the Colo|nies mu&s;t decide the conte&s;t in their favour. In the af|fair of Quebec, there is another circum&s;tance to be con|&s;idered; it was a Wolfe who commanded, a man of the mo&s;t wonderful talents, formed to level all difficulties, to render the mo&s;t de&s;picable &s;oldiery almo&s;t in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly an army of heroes. In &s;hort, the genius of the man was &s;o extraordinary, the event was &s;o extraordina|ry, that no inferences can be drawn from it; but this, without pre&s;umption, may be a&s;&s;erted, that no general, now exi&s;ting in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, would, with double or treble his number, have &s;ucceeded in the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="024456_0100_0FC770A117FC6568">One thing more I mu&s;t add in honour of that illu&s;tri|ous per&s;onage, that the &s;ame greatne&s;s of &s;oul which qualified him to conquer the natural hereditary enemies of this country, would have made him reject with horror the hangman's office; which others, who are not endow|ed with conquering attributes, will, with readine&s;s, ac|cept.</P>
<P>It is notorious, that Mr. Wolfe was not only that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;t of &s;oldiers, but that he was a mo&s;t liberal virtuous citizen; that he was pa&s;&s;ionately attached to the liberties of his country, and of mankind; and that he was particularly an enemy to large &s;tanding armies, in time of peace. It is, on the other hand, remarkable, that all the advocates for &s;tanding armies, all tho&s;e who are the fonde&s;t of the faddling and parade of war, are the mo&s;t active in avoid|ing real &s;ervice.</P>
<P>This tremendous &s;ooth&s;ayer, on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;o great a miracle &s;hould happen in our favour, as that the trifling body of 500,000 men, though firmly united (for every man in America, firmly united, would not amount to le&s;s) &s;hould be able to with&s;tand his 7000, goes on to rattle in our ears armies of He&s;&s;ians and Hanoverians. I wi&s;h to Heaven he had for once deviated into probabili|ty and truth: I wi&s;h 10,000 of them could po&s;&s;ibly be tran&s;ported to-morrow. The purpo&s;e they would an|&s;wer, is a purpo&s;e devoutly to be wi&s;hed for, they would be an addition to this continent of ju&s;t &s;o many u&s;eful and excellent citizens; for I will venture to affirm, af|firming is infectious, that in le&s;s than four months not two of the&s;e 10,000 would remain with their colours. But does not this reverend Gentleman know, that in the year 1764, a convention was formed by mo&s;t of the prin|ces of the empire, at the head of which convention were the emperor him&s;elf and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, to prevent the alarming emigrations which threatened depopulation to Germany? Does he not know, that no troops can march out of the empire without the con&s;ent of the Em|peror? Does he not know, that the Elector of Hanover and the Emperor are upon exceeding ill terms? Does
<PB N="94" REF="024456_0101_0FC770A3203898A0">
he not know, that the Elector of Hanover and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia are &s;till upon wor&s;e? Is he &s;ure that the Land|grave of He&s;&s;e would &s;ell his troops? For, as not one man would return back to their country, he mu&s;t con&s;i|der them as for ever &s;old. Is he &s;ure that, as the finan|ces of Great Britain &s;tand, the va&s;t &s;um nece&s;&s;ary for this purcha&s;e would be conveniently found? Is he &s;ure that the &s;tate of Hanover would con&s;ent to &s;uch a draining of their country? I know not how it is; but his mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty George the Third, who in England is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the mo&s;t gracious of &s;overeigns, the wi&s;e&s;t, greate&s;t, and be&s;t of kings, is not very popular in the Electorate of Hanover. The&s;e people &s;eem to think it hard, that 270,000l. &s;hould annually be drawn from them, for the purpo&s;es, as they conceive it, of corrupting the members of St. Stephen's Chapel, in order to &s;upport the power and authority of a &s;et of men, who, from the beginning, have been enemies to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Han|over line, and who &s;hewed a particular animo&s;ity to their la&s;t and favourite prince George the Second. But the&s;e difficulties (great and un&s;urmountable as to a common mortal they appear) our divine exorci&s;t has, in an in&s;tant, conjured down; and by a &s;ingle motion of his enchant|ed wand, has tran&s;ported whole armies in &s;pite of their re&s;pective princes, and without the con&s;ent of their re|&s;pective &s;tates, from the interior parts of Germany, acro&s;s the Atlantic into the plains of New England and Penn|&s;ylvania; but he does not confine him&s;elf to the intro|duction of his Germans. He proceeds next to erect the royal &s;tandard, to which he tells us, that all who have the courage to declare them&s;elves now friends to govern|ment, will undoubtedly re&s;ort; and the&s;e, he &s;ays, in a good cau&s;e, will be of them&s;elves formidable to their op|po&s;ers. Dreadfully formidable they mu&s;t be indeed! There would re&s;ort to it; let me &s;ee, for the re&s;pectable town of Rye, have declared them&s;elves a kind of neutrals. <HI>rather than friends to government;</HI> there would re&s;ort to it, Mr. Ju&s;tice Sewell, the honourable Mr. Paxton, Bri|gadier Kuggles, and about eight or ten more <HI>mandamus</HI>

council-men, with perhaps twice their number of expec|tants, and not le&s;s than twenty of the unrecanted Hutch|in&s;onian addre&s;&s;ers; the&s;e the four provinces of New England alone would &s;end forth. New York would fur|ni&s;h &s;ix, &s;even, or probably eight volunteers, from a cer|tain knot, who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or expectation of con|tracts, and the fourth part of a dozen of high-flying Church of England Romani&s;ed prie&s;ts. I repre&s;ent to my&s;elf the formidable countenance they will make, when arranged under the royal or mini&s;terial &s;tandard; but what will add to the terror of the appearance will be their Re|verend Pontifex him&s;elf, whom I conceive marching in the front, an inqui&s;itorial frown upon his brow, his bands and canonicals floating to the air, bearing a cro&s;s in his hands, with the tremendous motto, <HI>in hoc &s;igno vinces,</HI> flaming upon it in capital letters of blood, leading them on and exciting them to victory. It is impo&s;&s;ible that men, who are not under an infatuation by the judgment of Heaven, &s;hould flatter them&s;elves, that forty thou&s;and American yeomanry; for we are a&s;&s;ured by the &s;ame great authority, that more than forty thou&s;and cannot be brought to action, &s;hould &s;tand the &s;hock of this dread|ful phalanx.</P>
<P>But I &s;hould beg pardon for attempting to be ludicrous, upon a &s;ubject which demands our utmo&s;t indignation. I &s;hall now, therefore, on the pre&s;umption that the peo|ple of England &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t to &s;en&s;e, virtue and &s;pi|rit, as to &s;uffer their profligate mi&s;-rulers to per&s;evere in their pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, endeavour to &s;tate to you what is their force, and what is yours. I &s;hall endeavour to remove the fal&s;e terrors which this writer would hold out in order to intimidate you from the defence of your liberties and tho&s;e of po&s;terity, that he and his &s;imilars may wallow in &s;inecures and benefices, heaped up from the fruits of your labour and indu&s;try. Great Britain has, I believe, of infantry at home, comprehending Ire|land, and exclu&s;ive of the guards, fifteen thou&s;and men. They find the greate&s;t difficulty in keeping the regiments up to any thing near their e&s;tabli&s;hment: What they
<PB N="96" REF="024456_0103_0FC770A61B2F1758">
are able to procure are of the wor&s;t &s;ort. They are compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t debauched weavers, apprentices, the &s;cum of the Iri&s;h Roman Catholics, who de&s;ert upon every occa&s;ion, and a few Scotch, who are not &s;trong enough to carry packs. This is no exaggeration; tho&s;e who have been lately at Bo&s;ton, repre&s;ent the &s;oldiers there (one or two regiments excepted) as very defective in &s;ize, and apparently in &s;trength. But we &s;hall be told they are &s;till regulars, and regulars have an irre&s;i&s;tible advantage. There is, perhaps, more impo&s;ition in the term regular troops, than in any of the jargon which i&s;|&s;ues from the mouth of a quack doctor. I do not mean to in&s;inuate, that a di&s;orderly mob are equal to a trained di&s;ciplined body of men; but I mean, that all the e&s;&s;en|tials, nece&s;&s;ary to form infantry for real &s;ervice, may be acquired in a few months.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">There cannot be a &s;tronger illu&s;tration of the truth here advanced, than the Pru&s;&s;ian army. They are compo&s;ed of about one-third of the King's &s;ubjects, two-thirds foreigners. The third con&s;i&s;ting of his own &s;ubjects, are, when the exerci&s;ing &s;ea&s;on is over, which la&s;ts &s;ix or &s;even weeks, &s;uffered to return to their families, and attend to the bu|&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;bandry. Half of the other two-thirds, con&s;i&s;ting of foreign|ers, are not only permitted, but encouraged to work at their trades in the garri&s;on towns, and never touch a mu&s;quet for the re&s;t of the year. So that, in fact, only one-third are, in the modern language, to be cal|led regular &s;oldiers: the&s;e generally make their e&s;cape the fir&s;t oppor|tunity. It may be &s;aid, therefore, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has gained all his victories with a &s;ort of militia.</NOTE> I mean, that it is very po&s;|&s;ible for men to be cloathed in red, to be expert in all the tricks of the parade, to call them&s;elves regular troops, and yet, by attaching them&s;elves principally or &s;olely to the tin&s;el and &s;how of war, be totally unfit for real &s;er|vice. This, I am told, is a good deal the ea&s;e of the pre&s;ent Briti&s;h infantry.

<P>In the beginning of the late war, &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed regular regiments were &s;ent over to this coun|try; they were well dre&s;&s;ed, they were well powdered, they were perfect ma&s;ters of their manual exerci&s;e, they
<PB N="97" REF="024456_0104_0FC770A7B448B848">
fired together in platoons; but fatal experience taught us that they knew not how to fight. While your militia were frequently crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, the&s;e regulars were defeated or baffled for three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in every part of the Continent. At length, indeed, after repeated lo&s;&s;es and di&s;graces, they became excellent troops, but not until they had ab&s;olutely forgotten every thing which, we are a&s;&s;ured, mu&s;t render regulars quite irre&s;i&s;tible. The corps &s;ent from this country, under General Monkton, was, I believe, for its number, one of the be&s;t armies that ever was led to conque&s;t; and yet, if I have been rightly informed, there was not a &s;ingle regiment of them that could go through the manual ex|erci&s;e, or, at be&s;t, they performed it mo&s;t wretchedly. It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that when, after their glorious and rapid conque&s;t of Martinico, they were joined by the &s;pruce regiments from Europe, &s;uch was their uncooth appearance, that they were &s;carce honoured with the ti|tle of &s;oldiers by tho&s;e gentlemen. Upon the whole, it is mo&s;t certain that men may be &s;martly dre&s;&s;ed, keep their arms bright, be called regulars, be expert in all the anticks of a review, and yet be very unfit for real action. It is equally certain, that a militia, by confining them|&s;elves to e&s;&s;entials, by a &s;implification of the nece&s;&s;ary manoeuvres, may become, in a very few months, a mo&s;t formidable infantry. The yeomanry of America have, be&s;ides, infinite advantages over the pea&s;antry of other countries, they are accu&s;tomed from their infancy to fire arms; they are expert in the u&s;e of them; whereas the lower and middle people of England, are, by the ty|ranny of certain laws, almo&s;t as ignorant in the u&s;e of a mu&s;quet, as they are of the ancient catapulta. The Americans are likewi&s;e, to a man, &s;kilful in the manage|ment of the in&s;truments nece&s;&s;ary for all military works, &s;uch as &s;pades, pick-axes, hatchets, &amp;c. Taking, there|fore, all circum&s;tances into con&s;ideration, there will be no ra&s;hne&s;s in affirming, that this continent may have formed in action, in three or four months, one hundred thou&s;and infantry; for as to the a&s;&s;ertion of our friendly

advi&s;er, that <HI>no more than forty thou&s;and could act to ad|vantage,</HI> I confe&s;s I do not under&s;tand it, nor does he, I believe, under&s;tand it him&s;elf. If he means, that &s;ixty thou&s;and men cannot be ranged in a field, capable of containing only forty thou&s;and, we &s;hall all agree with him; but how, in the operation of a war, upon a va&s;t continent, double this number &s;hould be a di&s;advantage, I can have no conception.</P>
<P>Let one &s;imple general plan be adopted for the forma|tion and &s;ubdivi&s;ion of your battalions; let them be in|&s;tructed only in &s;o much of the manual exerci&s;e as to prevent confu&s;ion, and accidents in loading and firing; let them be taught to form, to retreat, to advance, to change their front, to rally by their colours; let them be taught to reduce them&s;elves from a line of fire to a line of impre&s;&s;ion, that is, from two deep to four, &s;ix, or eight. This is all &s;o ea&s;y and &s;imple, that it may be ac|quired in three months. Let &s;ome plan of this &s;ort be adopted, I &s;ay, and there is no doubt but that, in the time I have a&s;cribed, you may have an army on foot of &s;even|ty, eighty, or an hundred thou&s;and men, equal to all the &s;ervices of war.</P>
<P>Should this be admitted, it will be &s;till objected that you have no able officers to conduct you. I do not know that you have, but is it certain that tho&s;e &s;ent to dragoon you have better?

What is their rotine of in&s;truction? Do they read much? I am a&s;&s;ured that they do not. From books alone the theory of war can be acquired, and the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, in times of peace, affords them no prac|tical le&s;&s;ons! for mounting guard once or twice a week, or the preparation for the review of a &s;ingle regiment, can never be e&s;teemed as &s;uch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>It is much to be lamented, that the gentlemen of the army do not apply more of the many lei&s;ure hours they have upon their hands, to rea|ding.

But here I mu&s;t beg leave to pau&s;e for an in&s;tant, and a&s;k pardon of the public for my apparent pre&s;umption. An individual who offers his thoughts to &s;o re&s;pectable a body, as a Congre&s;s, delegated by the voice of a whole people, has certainly the air of pre&s;umption. It is in &s;ome mea&s;ure attributing to him&s;elf &s;uperior lights and abilities; but, on the other hand, it is allowed, that an individual has frequently been fortunate enough to chalk out lines in which the mo&s;t &s;agacious and re&s;pectable bodies have not di&s;dained to walk. If his propo&s;als, or hints, be weak and ab&s;urd, they will naturally be laughed at; but if his intentions be hone&s;t, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted from motives of rectitude and the love of his coun|try, will &s;ufficiently compen&s;ate for any ridicule which his &s;chemes can incur.

to &s;tem the profligacy and wickedne&s;s of the majority, and for the noble part they have acted as true Ameri|cans and excellent citizens; that another addre&s;s, no le&s;s warm, &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the gentlemen and people of New-York at large, expre&s;&s;ing your opinion of their hone&s;ty and public &s;pirit, and lamenting their peculiar circum&s;tances; which to tho&s;e who are &s;tran|gers to the&s;e circum&s;tances, may inculcate a belief that they done are exceptions to the character of patrioti&s;m, which the Americans are now indi&s;putably entitled to.

<HEAD>ON A FAMOUS <HI>TRIAL</HI> IN THE COURT OF <HI>COMMON PLEAS,</HI> BETWEEN <HI>GENERAL MOSTYN,</HI> GOVERNOR OF <HI>MINORCA,</HI> AND AN <HI>INHABITANT</HI> OF THAT ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a maxim with the Emperors of China, when the people of any of their provinces offer up complaints of their governors, immediately to recal them, to hear the charges brought again&s;t them, and, if they are found guilty, to puni&s;h them in proportion to their delinquen|cy; and &s;uch is the parental complacency of tho&s;e ea&s;t|ern monarchs for their &s;ubjects, that even when the grievances complained of prove ill-founded, the governor who has had the misfortune, though innocently, to incur the ill-opinion of the people, is never more employed, in the &s;ame capacity, over that or any other province, his having been <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> of mal-admini&s;tration being deemed a total di&s;qualification. Though the ju&s;tice of this maxim may not be univer&s;ally admitted, it certainly is a wife one, as it is founded on a re&s;pect and deference of the public wi&s;hes; to which, when it can be done com|patibly with the public &s;afety, that prince ought to pay the greate&s;t regard. But, how different has been the rule of conduct ob&s;erved through the whole pre&s;ent reign! Does a governor render him&s;elf completely odious to the people over whom he is &s;et to pre&s;ide?&mdash;he is that in&s;tant adopted a favourite at court. The infamous Ber|nard, who was not only arraigned, but &s;tands convicted, in the opinion of all mankind, of one continual &s;eries of mi&s;repre&s;entation, fal&s;ehoods, treachery, and every &s;pe|cies of trea&s;on to the people of his government, was con|tinued until the la&s;t po&s;&s;ible moment; and, when recal|led,

&s;o far from meeting with the cen&s;ures he had merit|ed, that he was exalted to the rank of a baronet, and had an ample provi&s;ion made for him in Ireland. And this public reward for delinquency has had the effect which mu&s;t naturally be expected; for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in office, it is reported, pitches many bars beyond him in perfidy and wickedne&s;s, for which he probably expects an Iri&s;h peerage. And, to &s;ay the truth, if our court acts con|&s;i&s;tently with it&s;elf, they are obliged, as his merits are &s;till greater, to confer on him a higher title, and a more ample provi&s;ion than on the boronet, his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>If we turn our eyes towards Ireland, the dencency and kindne&s;s exhibited by the court for that people is &s;till more &s;triking. The late viceroy, by talents peculiar to him&s;elf, almo&s;t on his fir&s;t landing, incurred the con|tempt and dete&s;tation of the whole kingdom, to a man, This was a &s;ufficient, and, apparently, the only motive of his being continued for a long five years in his &s;tation; for, what other motive can be conjectured? As it is agreed, on all hands, that even the wretched expedients from day to day, little jobs and larcenies, as well as the more &s;ub&s;tantial plundering, called, in the cant of cour|tiers, bu&s;ine&s;s of government, were never &s;o mi&s;erably bungled through as by this ridiculous mock-maje&s;ty. At length, however, a &s;ucce&s;&s;or is appointed: at length, under the protection of the whole military, he is with|drawn from the ju&s;t re&s;entment of the people whom he had oppre&s;&s;ed, beggared, and in&s;ulted; and at length, thus circum&s;tanced, he is pre&s;ented to his &s;overeign, by whom he is care&s;&s;ed, &s;miled upon, and preferred in &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a manner, that a &s;tranger who had been pre&s;ent, would have been apt to imagine him returned loaded with the &s;poils of &s;ome ancient inveterate enemy of his country, and not with the injuries and execration of a whole nation of loyal and affectionate &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Such has been the mode of treating the grievances of our natural brethren of Ireland and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and a &s;till more comfortable pro&s;pect is opened to our fellow &s;ubjects who are not of a Briti&s;h extraction.

<P>ON Monday the 23d of November la&s;t, the honoura|ble Major General Conway &s;et out from this city,
<PB N="112" REF="024456_0119_0FC770DA70FA0278">
on his return to France. The hi&s;tory of the treatment this gentleman had received, is &s;o &s;ingular that it mu&s;t make a figure in the anecdotes of mankind. He was born in Ireland, but at the age of &s;ix was carried into France; was bred up from his infancy to the profe&s;&s;ion of arms; and, it is univer&s;ally allowed, by the gentlemen of the nation, that he has, in their &s;ervice, the reputation of being what is &s;tiled <HI>un tres brave major d' infanterie,</HI> which is no &s;mall character. It implies, if I comprehend the term right, a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the requi&s;ite quali|ties to fill the duties of a general officer in the &s;econdary line, but by no means ranks him among tho&s;e favoured mortals to whom it has plea&s;ed God to give &s;o large a portion of the ethereal &s;pirit, as to render reading, theo|ry and practice unnece&s;&s;ary; but with the &s;pectacle of this phaenomena Heaven entertains the earth but very &s;eldom; Greece, as hi&s;torians report, had but one;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alexander; Henry the Fifth; and the Prince of Conde. It may be di&s;puted, however, whether the&s;e heroes were indebted to the gift of Heaven alone for their glories. Alexander &s;erved &s;ome campaigns under his father Philip, had Ari&s;totle for his ma&s;ter. Henry, before he became king, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the civil wars again&s;t the hou&s;e of Northumberland, and, if I recollect right, commanded in &s;ome ex|pedition again&s;t the Wel&s;h; and the Prince of Conde had le&s;&s;ons from the great ma&s;ters formed in the &s;chools of the wars in the Low Country.</NOTE> Rome none; England and France, only one each.&mdash; As to this hemi&s;phere, I &s;hall be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, left I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of not being &s;erious. But be this as it may, it is pa&s;t doubt that General Conway is a man of excellent under&s;tanding, quick and penetrating, that he has &s;een much &s;ervice, has read a great deal, and di|ge&s;ted well what he has read. It is not le&s;s certain, that he embarked, with the warme&s;t zeal, for the great American Cau&s;e, and it has never been in&s;inuated, un|le&s;s by tho&s;e who have the talent of confounding cau&s;es, that his zeal has dimini&s;hed. His recompence has been, What? he has lo&s;t his commi&s;&s;ion; he has been refu&s;ed the common certificate, which every officer receives at the expiration of his &s;ervices, unle&s;s his delinquencies have been very &s;ub&s;tantial indeed. And for what crime?
<PB N="113" REF="024456_0120_0FC770DBF04ADE88">
For none, by any law, or the mo&s;t &s;trained con&s;truction that can be put on any law; the rea&s;ons given are &s;o far from being &s;ub&s;tantial, that they really ought to reflect ho|nour on his character. It &s;eems he has been accu&s;ed of writing a letter, to a confidential friend, communicating an opinion that the commander in chief was not equal to the great ta&s;k he was charged with. Is this a crime? The contrary. If it was really his opinion, it was decent, it was hone&s;t, it was laudable, it was his duty. Does it come under any article of war? I may venture to affirm, that it does not. God help the community that &s;hould be ab&s;urd enough to frame a law which could be con|&s;trued into &s;uch a &s;en&s;e; &s;uch a community could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. It ever has been, and ever ought to be, the cu&s;tom in all armies, not ab&s;olutely barbarians, for the officers of high rank minutely to canva&s;s the mea&s;ures of their commander in chief; and if his faults or mi&s;|takes appear to them many and great, to communicate their &s;entiments to each other; it can be attended with no one bad con&s;equence; for if the critici&s;ms are unju&s;t and impertinent, they only recoil on the authors; and the great man who is the &s;ubject of them, &s;hines with redoubled lu&s;tre. But if they are all well founded, they tend to open the eyes of the Prince or &s;tate, who, from blind prejudice, or &s;ome &s;trange infatuation, may have repo&s;ed their affairs in hands ruinou&s;ly incapable. Does any man of &s;en&s;e, who is the lea&s;t acquainted with hi&s;to|ry, imagine that the greate&s;t generals the world ever pro|duced have e&s;caped cen&s;ure? Hanibal, Cae&s;ar, Turene, Marlborough, have all been cen&s;ured; and the only Method they thought ju&s;tifiable of &s;topping the mouths of their cen&s;ors, was by a fre&s;h exertion of their talents, and a perpetual &s;eries or victories. <HI>Lai&s;&s;ons parler ces hableurs l'e&s;pere, que nous leur fermerons la bouche a force des vic|toires,</HI> was the an&s;wer of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to tho&s;e worthy Gentlemen, who thought to recommend them|&s;elves by informing him, that &s;ome of his mea&s;ures were made very free with by certain officers in his army. In|deed, it is ob&s;ervable, that in proportion to the capacity
<PB N="114" REF="024456_0121_0FC770DD7657C610">
or incapacity of the commander in chief, he counte|nances or di&s;countenances the whole tribe of talebear|ers, informers, and pickthanks, who ever have been, and ever will be, the bane of tho&s;e courts and armies where they are encouraged, or even &s;uffered. Allowing Ge|neral Wa&s;hington to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the virtues and military talents of Epaminondas, and this is certainly al|lowing a great deal, for whether from our modern edu|cation, or perhaps the modern &s;tate of human affairs, it is difficult to conceive that any mortal in the&s;e ages &s;hould arrive at &s;uch perfection; but allowing it to be &s;o, he would &s;till remain mortal, and of cour&s;e &s;ubject to the infirmities of human nature: &s;ickne&s;s or other ca&s;ualties might impair his under&s;tanding, his memory, or his cou|rage; and, in con&s;equence of the failure, he might adopt mea&s;ures apparently weak, ridiculous, and pernicious. Now, I demand, &s;uppo&s;ing this certainly a po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e, whether a law, the letter or &s;pirit of which &s;hould ab&s;o|lutely &s;eal up the lips and re&s;train the pens, of every wit|ne&s;s of the defection, would not, in fact, be denouncing vengeance again&s;t tho&s;e who alone have the means in their power of &s;aving the public from the ruin impen|ding, if they &s;hould dare to make u&s;e of the&s;e means for its &s;alvation. If there were &s;uch a law, its ab&s;urdity would be &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly glaring, that we may hardly &s;ay, it would be more honoured in the breach than in the ob&s;ervance. In the Engli&s;h and French armies, the freedom with which the conduct and mea&s;ures of com|manders in chief are canva&s;&s;ed is notorious, nor does it appear that this freedom is attended with any bad con|&s;equences; it has never been once able to remove a <HI>real</HI> great officer from his command. Every action of the Duke of Marlborough (every body who has read mo&s;t know) was not only minutely critici&s;ed, but his whole conduct was di&s;&s;ected, in order to di&s;cover &s;ome crime, blunder, fault, or even trifling error; but all the&s;e imper|tinent pains and wicked indu&s;try, were employed in vain; it was a court intrigue alone that &s;ubverted him; the low military cabals pa&s;&s;ed as the idle wind.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="024456_0122_0FC770E1F161CCC8">General Wolfe, with whom to be compared, it can be no degradation to any mortal living, was not merely critici&s;ed, but gro&s;sly calumniated by &s;ome officers of high rank under him; but that great man never thought of having recour&s;e to the letter or con&s;truction of any law, in order to avenge him&s;elf; he was contented with informing his calumniators, that he was not ignorant of their practices, and that the only method he &s;hould take for their puni&s;hment, would be an active per&s;everance in the performance of his duty, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, he made no doubt would place him beyond the reach of their malice. As to what liberties they had ta|ken with him per&s;onally, he &s;hould wait till he was re|duced to the rank of a private gentleman, and then &s;peak to them in that capacity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it appears, that it never was under|&s;tood to be the meaning of the Engli&s;h article of war, which enjoins re&s;pect towards the commander in chief; and of cour&s;e it ought not to be under&s;tood, that the mean|ing of that article of the American code (which is a &s;er|vile copy from the Engli&s;h) is meant to pro&s;cribe the communication of our &s;entiments to one another, on the capacity or incapacity of the man on whom the &s;afety or ruin of the &s;tate depends; its intention was, without doubt, in part, complimentary, and partly to lay &s;ome de|cent re&s;trictions on the licence of conver&s;ation and wri|ting, which otherwi&s;e might create a diffidence in the minds of the common &s;oldiery, detrimental to the pub|lic &s;ervice. But that it was meant to impo&s;e a dead, torpid, idolatrous &s;ilence, in all ca&s;es whatever, on men, who, from their rank, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have eyes and under&s;tanding, nothing under the degree of an idiot can per&s;uade him&s;elf: but admitting, in oppo&s;ition to common &s;en&s;e and all precedents, the proceeding to be criminal; admitting Mr. Conway guilty of it, to the ex|tent repre&s;ented, which he can demon&s;trate to be fal&s;e; in the name of God, why inflict the highe&s;t, at lea&s;t ne|gative puni&s;hment, on a man untried and unheard. The refu&s;al of a certificate, of having hone&s;tly &s;erved, is con|&s;idered
<PB N="116" REF="024456_0123_0FC770E42C2EAB40">
as the greate&s;t of negative puni&s;hments; indeed in the military idea, it is a po&s;itive one.</P>
<P>And I &s;incerely hope, and do firmly believe (&s;uch is my opinion of the ju&s;tice of Congre&s;s) that when they have coolly reflected on the merits and fortunes of this gentleman, they will do him that ju&s;tice, which nothing but the ha&s;ty mi&s;con&s;truction of a law ha&s;tily copied from another law, never defined nor under&s;tood, has hitherto prevented.</P>

<P>COUNT Pola&s;ki is certainly a good &s;oldier, or he is not; for my own part, I believe him a very good one. In the fir&s;t place he is a Polander, who&s;e genius is adapted to the light or expedite war. In the &s;econd place, he has had much practice in the be&s;t &s;chools, and is undoubtedly brave and enterpri&s;ing. If he is not a good &s;oldier, as his corps is expen&s;ive, he ought not to be detained; therefore, it is expedient, either to &s;end him about his bu&s;ine&s;s entirely, or to make the proper u&s;e of him; but on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he knows his trade, I would propo&s;e the following &s;cheme&mdash;That his legion &s;hould be immediately completed to twelve hun|dred men, four hundred cavalry, and eight hundred light infantry&mdash;for the&s;e eight hundred infantry, that a draft &s;hould be made, without lo&s;s of time, from every regiment of the continent, entirely of natives; not &s;o young as to be unable to re&s;i&s;t the fatigues of this &s;ort of &s;ervice, but of the proper age for violent exerci&s;e and forced marches. Major Lee, who &s;eems to have come out of his mother's womb a &s;oldier, &s;hould be incorpo|rated in this legion, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and to command &s;pecifically the whole cavalry. If Ma|jor Lee's corps (for I know not their &s;trength) will not, added to the cavalry Pola&s;ki already has, complete them
<PB N="117" REF="024456_0124_0FC770E70EA511B8">
to four hundred, let there be a draft made from the other regiment of cavalry, Moilands, Blands, and Sheldons, all of natives, and the very younge&s;t men; becau&s;e on Pola&s;ki's principle of exerci&s;e (which I believe to be the be&s;t in the world) none but very young men are capable of being trained to the manoeuvres; but as it is not cer|tain that either Count Pola&s;ki or Major Lee under&s;tand the detail of cavalry, on which &s;o much depends, let &s;ome Quarter-Ma&s;ters, or Serjeants, who have &s;erved in the Briti&s;h cavalry, (and there are many on the conti|nent) be found out, encouraged with rank and emolu|ment, and employed. A corps thus compo&s;ed, with brave and under&s;tanding officers at their head, &s;uch as are Pola&s;ki and Lee, with a few &s;ubordinate officers, knowing, in the detail, will render more effectual &s;ervice than any ten regiments on the continent. It would likewi&s;e put a &s;top, for the future, to that odious, perni|cious practice of picking the be&s;t men from every bat|talion, on what are called extraordinary occa&s;ions; which practice has ab&s;olutely no other effect than di&s;gu&s;ting the greater part of the officers of the army, and render|ing the whole di&s;pirited and unfit for action. I could quote a &s;trong in&s;tance of the bad con&s;equences of this cu&s;tom. Some days before the affair of Monmouth, Ge|neral Scott was detached with a corps of picked men and officers, to the no &s;mall di&s;gu&s;t of tho&s;e who were left behind, who could not help con&s;idering it as a &s;ort of &s;tigma on their character. After this, the Marquis de la Fayette was detached with another corps of one thou&s;and, picked out in the &s;ame manner. This body, now con&s;i&s;ting of twenty five hundred men, in&s;tead of falling on the enemies' flanks, did, from &s;ome fatality, ab&s;olutely nothing at all. I was afterwards ordered to march to &s;u&s;tain them, with three &s;canty brigades, com|po&s;ed entirely of the refu&s;e; and of this refu&s;e I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of forming my van-guard on the day of the action of Monmouth; for the picked corps, by the blunders committed, were &s;o fatigued that they could &s;carcely move their legs.</P>

Whether it mu&s;t not appear to every man who has read General Wa&s;hington's letter to Congre&s;s, on the affair at Monmouth, and the proceedings of the Court-Martial, by which General Lee was tried, that if the contents of the former are facts, not only General Lee's defence mu&s;t be a ti&s;&s;ue of the mo&s;t abominable audacious lies, but that the whole &s;tring of evidences,

<P>I MAJOR GENERAL CHARLES LEE, of the county of Berkley, in the commonwealth of Vir|ginia, being in perfect health, and of a &s;ound mind, con&s;idering the certainty of death, and the uncertainty of the time it may happen, have determined to make this my la&s;t will and te&s;tament, in manner following: that is to &s;ay, I give and bequeath to Alexander White, E&s;q. one hundred guineas, in con&s;ideration of the zeal and integrity he has di&s;played in the admini&s;tration of my affairs, al&s;o the choice of any two of my colts or fil|lies under four years of age.</P>
<P>Item, I give and bequeath to Charles Minn Thru&s;ton, E&s;q. fifty guineas, in con&s;ideration of his good qualities and the friend&s;hip he has manife&s;ted for me; and to Buckner Thru&s;ton, his &s;on, I leave all my books, as I know he will make a good u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>To my good friend John Mercer, E&s;q. of Marlbo|rough in Virginia, I give and bequeath the choice of two brood mares, of all my &s;words and pi&s;tols, and ten gui|neas to buy a ring: I would give him more, but as he has a good e&s;tate and a better genius, he has &s;ufficient, if he knows how to make a good u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>I give and bequeath to my former aid de camp, Ot|way Bird, E&s;q. the choice of another brood mare, and ten guineas for the &s;ame purpo&s;e of a remembrance-ring.</P>
<P>I give and bequeath to my worthy friend Colonel William Gray&s;on, of Dumfries, the &s;econd choice of two colts; and to my excellent friend William Steptoe, of Virginia, I would leave a great deal, but as he is now &s;o rich, it would be no le&s;s than robbing my other friends

who are poor. I therefore entreat, he will only accept of five guineas, which I bequeath to him to purcha&s;e a ring of affection.</P>
<P>I bequeath to my old and faithful &s;ervant, or rather humble friend, Gui&s;ippi Minghini, three hundred gui|neas, with all my hor&s;es, mares, and colts of every kind, tho&s;e abovementioned excepted; likewi&s;e all my wear|ing apparel and plate, my waggons and tools of agricul|ture, and his choice of four milch cows.</P>
<P>I bequeath to Elizabeth Dunn, my hou&s;ekeeper, one hundred guineas and my whole &s;tock of cattle, the four milch cows abovementioned only excepted.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot my dear friends, (and I ought to be a&s;hamed of it) Mrs. Shippen, her &s;on Thomas Ship|pen, and Thomas Lee, E&s;q. of Belle-View. I beg they will accept ten guineas each, to buy rings of affection.</P>

<P>All my &s;laves, which I may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of at the time of my decea&s;e, I bequeath for Gui&s;ippi Minghini and Elizabeth Dunn, to be equally divided between them.</P>
<P>All my other property of every kind, and in every part of the world, after my decea&s;e, funeral charges, and nece&s;&s;ary expences of admini&s;tration are paid, I give,

<P>YOUR American po&s;ts are exce&s;&s;ive hard upon me, and <HI>mal regl&egrave;e's.</HI> You and Montgomery are &s;o good as to write to me often from thence. I have been, upon honour, very exact in my an&s;wers, without having been lucky enough that either of you &s;hould have heard from me. This time I hope to be more fortunate, hav|ing recommended my letter to the be&s;t hand. I envy you all the &s;ervice you have &s;een whil&s;t I have been in the mo&s;t &s;luggi&s;h inactivity. I have indeed got a &s;on, but <HI>cela ne conte gueres.</HI> Our good fortune, and that of our friends, has been indefatigable this year, To-day, we have the news of the &s;urrender of Mun&s;ter, and the French in Germany retiring, probably into winter quarters. Daun is doing the &s;ame, and is likely to leave the amazing King of Pru&s;&s;ia once more in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saxony. The Ru&s;&s;ians, we flatter our&s;elves, will move no more. The Bre&s;t fleet is out; Hawke after them, and a good ac|count of them hoped for, and expected every moment.
<PB N="127" REF="024456_0134_0FC7710511DDFD68">
Next year I hope to have &s;omething to do in Germany, where they talk of &s;ending us. I believe you already know my trade&mdash;Lieutenant Colonel to George Elliott's Light Dragoons. Being as hor&s;e-mad as ever, and hav|ing the rank of Colonel before, by being the King's aid de camp, I preferred <HI>that</HI> to a young regiment of foot. So many children have of late been made Generals, that we Children-colonels are already very high in the li&s;t. The riding of this new corps has kept me fully employed this whole &s;ummer, and I am now come up to town for winter quarters, which the &s;ea&s;on makes much more plea&s;ant than the country ones. We are all here in grief for the lo&s;s of poor Wolfe. Nobody of that age can be more publicly and privately admired and regretted. The war in America, we are in hopes, will be over very &s;oon; if &s;o, I &s;hall hope then to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you. The French's fighting-days &s;eem to be over, or, at lea&s;t, &s;u&s;pended. Every day produces a change among&s;t them, of generals, admirals, and mini&s;try; and every thing &s;peaks them to be in the greate&s;t poverty and di&s;union. It don't often happen here, or any where el&s;e, I believe, but there is certainly at pre&s;ent among&s;t all here the greate&s;t &s;pirits and unanimity imaginable, and no appear|ances of want; much debauch, and good living; &s;o pray come among&s;t us &s;oon. You have the good fortune not only to have &s;een &s;ervice enough, but mo&s;t of it &s;uc|ce&s;sful. All your friends are well.

<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have obliged me very much by a &s;econd letter come lately to my hands, and dated at Niagara. We had before received accounts of the reduction of it, and your being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the glorious country around; which, by your de&s;cription, mu&s;t be a paradi&s;e indeed; and it is much to be wi&s;hed, it may never again go out of your hands. Our acqui&s;ition this year have been &s;o great and important, that it has been thought proper to appoint to-morrow a public thank&s;giving-day: and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Amher&s;t has not got &s;o forward as was expected, yet he &s;ends word he is Ma&s;ter of Lake Champlain; which, as we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the other &s;ide of Quebec, mu&s;t bound the enemy between the two in &s;uch a manner, as, we conclude here, will di&s;tre&s;s them extremely, if not oblige them to make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;urrender. In Europe, you will have heard Bo&s;cawen fell in with the Toulon fleet, and took four of them; and we are now in hourly expectation of Hawke's overtaking the Bre&s;t fleet, which &s;tole out of the harbour the other day, in order, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, to cover a de&s;cent, either upon Ireland or this country, which they have long threatened us with; but it mu&s;t be a very de&s;perate game they are playing, &s;ince, if our &s;hips have the luck to come up with them, we have little fear here of their giving them &s;uch a blow as will put an end to the naval force of France for &s;ome time to come.&mdash;But I will talk no more of public affairs; it will probably be of greater &s;atisfaction to you, to hear of the welfare of your friends and relations, which I am happily enabled at pre&s;ent to a&s;&s;ure you of; for I know not of any exception among&s;t them all. My &s;on is gone to Turin, and I hope we may pre&s;ume upon his health, though we have not lately heard from him; he is to &s;tay here five or &s;ix months, and afterwards to ramble about Italy another twelve-month. Your &s;i&s;ter Sidney com|plains you do not write &s;o often as &s;he wi&s;hes. I gave her the &s;atisfaction of knowing you had favoured me lately with a letter, and that you were well and happy,
<PB N="129" REF="024456_0136_0FC771076E63CB20">
as I am willing to &s;uppo&s;e by the &s;train of your &s;tile, which is very lively and entertaining. The books and choco|late you de&s;ired, have been &s;ent to Mr. Calcroft near a month ago, who has taken the charge of them; and I hope they will get &s;afe to your hand: But &s;ure you are not to &s;tay on that continent for ever: We wi&s;h you to come again among&s;t your friends, and probably &s;ome change might be procured, as well as advance, on this &s;ide of the water, if you de&s;ire it. Lord Granby com|mands in Germany at pre&s;ent, and is likely to be at the head of the army on this &s;ide of the water too, if Ligonier drops; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed he cannot la&s;t a great while longer. The taking of Mun&s;ter, which we had advice of the other day, will be of great importance to our allied army, and &s;ecure them good winter quarters. A great many matches are talked of here in town, &s;o that if you do not come &s;oon, all our fine young ladies will be di&s;po&s;|ed of; but I know of none of your more particular acquaintance that have, or are about, changing their &s;tate. Pray go on writing to us; nobody better qualified to en|tertain by their letters: I wi&s;h I had as good a knack on my &s;ide, for the &s;ake of your amu&s;ement. Your aunt and cou&s;ins beg to live con&s;tantly in your memory and good wi&s;hes; they de&s;ire I will a&s;&s;ure you, you have theirs mo&s;t heartily; and I hope I need not add, that you will invariably have tho&s;e of your affectionate and obliged uncle,</P>

<P>I ADMIRE, very much, the &s;ubtilty of your rea&s;on|ing, and the arguments you run after, to prove me in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ault for the &s;ilence you have long ob&s;erved, which, I con|fe&s;s, has furni&s;hed me often with &s;ubject for reflections.

that I have permitted to torment me whil&s;t I was in ex|pectation of it; and therefore &s;hall proceed immediately to thank you for the intelligence it brings me, and the a&s;&s;urances it renews of your affection and friend&s;hips.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been heartily glad to have heard, my dear Colonel, that his Maje&s;ty's recommendation had been more &s;ucce&s;sful in procuring you an e&s;tabli&s;hment equal to your merit and wi&s;hes; but am not at all &s;urpri&s;ed that you find the door &s;hut again&s;t you by the per&s;on who has &s;uch unbounded credit; as you have ever in <HI>freely</HI> indulged a liberty of declaiming, which many infa|mous and invidious people have not failed to inform him of. The principle on which you thus openly &s;peak your mind, is hone&s;t and patriotic, but not politic; and is it will not &s;ucceed in changing men or times, common prudence &s;hould teach us to hold our tongues, rather than to ri&s;que our own fortunes without any pro&s;pect of advantage to our&s;elves or neighbours. Excu&s;e this &s;cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p of advice, my dear Colonel, and place it to the vent of a heart entirely devoted to your intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I remember my promi&s;e, to inform you of the tran&s;|actions of this place; and had I received a line from you upon the road, &s;hould have endeavoured to find time during the diet to have given you a &s;ketch of the critical and unexpected affairs that agitated us; it will be need|le&s;s now, as the public papers and your other corre&s;pon|dents here have, doubtle&s;s, not failed to in&s;truct you. The important affair of the di&s;&s;idents was rudely and in|&s;olently refu&s;ed; and you cannot be ignorant that tho&s;e gentlemen have formed two confederations in Poland and in Lithuania, &s;upportd by a Ru&s;&s;ian army of thirty or forty thou&s;and men, and that we expect a diet extra|ordinary in the months of Augu&s;t or September, for ter|minating their demands, to the &s;atisfaction of the po|wers who intere&s;t them&s;elves in their behalf: and though it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how it will end, yet the appearan|ces at pre&s;ent are much in their favour, and we have all rea&s;on to think, that it will be conducted without any interruption of the tranquillity of the republic.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="024456_0138_0FC7710F20AEE5C8">You mu&s;t not imagine, that however important this negociation is, that our great men cannot find time for other amu&s;ements and engagements.

<SALUTE>My Dear Lee,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF all men on earth, you are the la&s;t from whom I expected to hear, unle&s;s it was in a paragraph of a fo|reign Gazette, that &s;uch a day Mon&s;. General Lee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Anglois,</HI> was cut to pieces, defending his Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty, or in &s;ome de&s;perate uncommon attack; or, which was fully as likely, that you was hanged for trea&s;on, in &s;ome of the damned arbitrary governments you have been wandering through. But, how &s;urprised! when, in the place of this, I received a flattering letter from you, da|ted Dijon. Surely, Lee, the climate of France has produced this wonderful effect. I am &s;ure in Old En|gland you would never flatter any man, much le&s;s one whom you honoured with your friend&s;hip. Do you not know how apt we all are to forget our&s;elves when in power, or upon any &s;udden elevation; and how very ready we are to believe all the hand&s;ome things that even the mo&s;t abject &s;ycophants are plea&s;ed to be&s;patter us with? Then, my friend, how much more dangerous mu&s;t it be from a man, of who&s;e under&s;tanding I have al|ways had the highe&s;t opinion? And who is &s;o remarka|ble for his candor and freedom of &s;peech, that they are, to the di&s;grace of our day, well known to be his greate&s;t enemies. In &s;pite of what I &s;ay, I will acknowledge I am proud of your good opinion, though delivered in too flattering a &s;tile; but I hope it will have no other effect than to make me endeavour to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted, that you will like to know how I bear my promotion, I will give you as impartial an ac|count of it, in as few words as it is po&s;&s;ible for a man to give of him&s;elf. I feel my&s;elf independent, and a &s;lave to &s;laves, obliged to court and flatter men whom I de&s;|pi&s;e, both for their want of abilities and want of hone&s;ty. I hate power, and tho&s;e in it, more and more every day. I am plainer in my table and apparel than you ever knew me, without an attempt or wi&s;h to be rich. I have chil|dren and I feel they may one day be under another go|vernor, on the &s;pot where their father once pre&s;ided.
<PB N="133" REF="024456_0140_0FC771120B458750">
This helps to make me careful, and as tender as po&s;&s;ible of tho&s;e entru&s;ted to my care. My actions are as pub|lic as they can po&s;&s;ibly be made; and I hope my chil|dren and friends will never have rea&s;on to blu&s;h, or be a&s;hamed to hear of them. I find the care of a people a more difficult thing than I imagined it to be, and I found my&s;elf very defective as a legi&s;lator: the former, perhaps, time may render more ea&s;y, and I am endeavouring to remedy the latter, by as clo&s;e an application, to &s;tudy the &s;pirit of the laws of my country, as is in my power; in the mean time, I am cautious of doing much, le&s;t I may do more evil than good. This, if I know any thing of my&s;elf, is truth. How you will like the daubed por|trait, I know not, nor whether or not, I may not forfeit a part of your good opinion, by the badne&s;s of the at|tempt.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid &s;o much of my&s;elf, I now come to your bu&s;ine&s;s; and in the fir&s;t place, I promi&s;e you, if it be in my power to do any for you, I will, and with more pleasure than you can a&s;k me. In the mean time, I can an&s;wer you &s;ome of your queries to a greater certainty, by being here, than if I had received your letter in Suffolk Street, where you directed it to me.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED two letters from you; one by Mr. Hey, the other by the pacquet: I thank you mo&s;t &s;in|cerely for both. Your fir&s;t was particularly acceptable, as it gave me an opportunity of renewing and of improv|ing my acquaintance with a gentleman, for who&s;e cha|racter I have always had an high e&s;teem. My particu|lar friends were the fir&s;t who took notice of his merit. They imagined, that they could not do a better &s;ervice to government, in a newly acquired F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">h country, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to &s;end them one of the be&s;t &s;amples we were able to furni&s;h of plain manly Engli&s;h &s;en&s;e and integrity. I wi&s;h tho&s;e who rule at pre&s;ent may &s;hew, by the provi&s;i|on they make for him here, that &s;uch qualities are &s;till in &s;ome reque&s;t among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>It was extremely kind of you to remember your friends in our dull worn out hemi&s;phere, among the infinite ob|jects of curio&s;ity, that are &s;o exuberantly &s;pread out before you, in the va&s;t field of America. There is, indeed, abundant matter, both natural and political, to give full &s;cope to a mind active and interpri&s;ing like yours; where &s;o much has been done and undone; and where &s;till there is an ample range for wi&s;dom and mi&s;take. Either mu&s;t produce con&s;iderable effects in an affair of &s;uch ex|tent and importance. It will be no light mi&s;chief, and no trivial benefit. When one con&s;iders, what might be

<P>Here, as we have met &s;o we continue, in the mo&s;t per|fect repo&s;e. It has been announced to us, that we are to have no bu&s;ine&s;s but the gold coin; this has not ap|peared as yet: And if there be nothing further than we hear of intended, it will come on time enough. The po|litics of the continent, which u&s;ed to engage your atten|tion &s;o much, attract no part of ours. Whether the American affairs will be brought before us is yet un|certain.</P>
<P>Saturday, I heard the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts petition again&s;t their governor and deputy, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before council. It was &s;poken to, very ably, by the council on either &s;ide; by Me&s;&s;rs. Dunning and Lee, for the province; by Mr. Wedderburn for the governors. The latter uttered a furious Philippic <HI>again&s;t poor Doctor Franklin.</HI> It requir|ed all his Philo&s;ophy, natural and acquired, to &s;upport him again&s;t it. I heard that the petition will be rejected. The council was the fulle&s;t of any in our memory; thir|ty-five attended.</P>
<P>I hope, as you &s;ay nothing of it in your la&s;t letter, that you fit of the gout was but gentle, and rather a &s;harp remedy than any thing that de&s;erves to be called a di&s;|ea&s;e.

<SALUTE>MY DEAR LEE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your long letter with great plea&s;ure, and will an&s;wer it as fully as I am able. You mu&s;t have mi&s;under&s;tood me, in what I &s;aid of the bill to al|ter the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts government, if you imagined I had either concurred in, or even forborn to expre&s;s my ful|le&s;t di&s;approbation of it, when it was depending in the hou&s;e. The fact is &s;o much otherwi&s;e, that I fought it through every &s;tage, almo&s;t alone, when mo&s;t of the op|po&s;ition were attending the New-Market meeting, or other occupations, equally entitled to be preferred to that duty. I may have &s;aid indeed, that I prefer the form of the Engli&s;h government to that of any other country upon earth, becau&s;e it appears to me mo&s;t calculated to reconcile nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint and natural liberty, and to draw the line between them. It is the government I was born under, I am happy to live under, and would willingly die to pre&s;erve and tran&s;mit entire; but I look upon the fir&s;t principle of that con&s;titution to be, that the whole mu&s;t be governed by the will of the whole, and that any government where the authority re&s;iding with the <HI>few</HI> is &s;upported by any other power than that of the <HI>many,</HI> in con&s;equence of their free concurrence and full approbation, is the wor&s;t of tyranny. Judge
<PB N="141" REF="024456_0148_0FC7712AD9BF3F60">
then, my dear friend, whether I could approve of tear|ing from a free and happy people that form of govern|ment which had been purcha&s;ed with the blood, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the wi&s;dom of their ance&s;tors; and of &s;ubverting that excellent polity, endeared to them by their pro&s;perity, and &s;anctified by the mo&s;t laudable of human predilections, a veneration for their ance&s;tors, and an enthu&s;ia&s;m for the permanence of their liberties. <HI>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari,</HI> was the noble&s;t expre&s;|&s;ion that ever bore te&s;timony to the &s;pirit of a free legi&s;|lature. I think it as laudable at Bo&s;ton now, as in Lon|don &s;ome centuries ago. So far I &s;tand upon the ground of natural right and manly feeling&mdash;thus much, I &s;ay, becau&s;e&mdash;<HI>Homo &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI>&mdash;but to de&s;cend to the humbler ground of policy, nothing can be &s;o ab&s;urd, or impoli|te, as to &s;hake a frame &s;anctified by long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for the caprice of a moment, or the fancies of a few; to &s;acrifice the wi&s;dom of ages to the pre&s;umption of an hour; and to divert the &s;tream of government, which has fertili&s;ed the country and enriched the people, by ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ls which it has gradually formed for it&s;elf, by &s;urmounting or eluding all the ob&s;tacles it has met with in its cour&s;e; from tho&s;e channels by dame rai&s;ed by &s;trange hands unacquainted with the country, which if they are not borne down by the torrent mu&s;t deluge the country and de&s;troy the ancient land-marks. If therefore I prefer in &s;peculation the government of Virginia to that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, it is not from thinking that what appears be&s;t in the ab&s;tract, &s;hould be impo&s;ed on all: on the contrary, I am convinced that the minds of individuals and the manners of a people form and adapt them&s;elves naturally and imperceptibly as the mode of government, under which they are born. The modifi|cations of municipal in&s;titutions are in them&s;elves indif|ferent, provided they are approved by the people; but it is of the e&s;&s;ence of freedom, and common to all free governments, that the people &s;hould be convinced the laws they live under are of their own chu&s;ing; and that there is no power on earth that can prolong their exi&s;t|ence,

or give force to their injunctions one hour, after the di&s;approbation of the ma&s;s of the people is &s;ignified.</P>
<P>I have been the more full upon this &s;ubject, becau&s;e I would not willingly he mi&s;taken in my principles upon &s;o material a point.

<P>As to my&s;elf, I am out of Parliament, without any pro&s;pect of being in; and though I &s;hould have thought it infamous to have de&s;erted my po&s;t and not endeavour|ed to get in, yet I hardly can &s;ay, that I much regret any being out there is &s;o little pro&s;pect of doing good.</P>

Should your blood mingle with the blood of Wolfe. Montcalm, and Montgomery, po&s;terity will execrate the plains of Abraham to the end of time.</P>
<P>Your appointment to the Canada expedition gave all your friends here great plea&s;ure. I think it is more than probable, the principal force of our enemies will be &s;ent to that quarter. Canada is dearer to the king than all the other colonies put together, as it is the only part of the Briti&s;h empire in which arbitrary power is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. Should that province become the &s;eat of war, we &s;hall have no rea&s;on to complain; for our &s;ea-coa&s;ts and &s;ea-port towns are in a poor &s;ituation to receive our enemies.</P>
<P>The Gulph and River St. Laurence, it is to be hoped, will concur with the elements in embarra&s;&s;ing them. Mr. Pitt conquered America in Germany; who knows but General Lee may conquer Britain in America?</P>
<P>I need not tell you, how much plea&s;ure it will give me to receive a few lines from you by all the expre&s;&s;es you &s;end to the Congre&s;s. I &s;hall write to you mo&s;t faithful|ly by the return of each of them. Colonel Thomp&s;on &s;peaks in raptures of you in all companies.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of the tenth ultimo, did not reach me till the twenty-&s;econd in&s;tant. I that day wrote you an an&s;wer by one Mr. Campbell who was on his way, and who promi&s;ed to give my letter a conveyance, if he did

not &s;ee you. I informed you, that I &s;aw no objections to your paying off the incumbrances on your land, and the future payments whenever it is convenient for you to do &s;o.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be happy to &s;ee the important &s;ubject of the independence of North America, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the per|&s;picuous and able manner you are capable of. I have troubled you with &s;ome of my crude thoughts, to afford you an opportunity when lei&s;ure will permit, and incli|nation lead you, to explain my mi&s;takes and correct my errors. From the commencement of the pre&s;ent un|happy di&s;pute, I con&s;idered the &s;hedding of blood, if that event &s;hould take place, as the aera, at which would ter|minate the Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h empire in America; or the colonies be &s;ubjugated to the ab&s;olute dominion of parliament; and when ho&s;tilities commenced, my mind was only agi|tated with the means of defending our&s;elves, and form|ing a con&s;titution which would &s;ecure &s;ub&s;tantial liberty to the people; when I found the Congre&s;s entertained different views, that they had again petitioned the king for reconciliation, and declared to their fellow &s;ubjects throughout the empire, that their only end in taking up arms was to procure a redre&s;s of grievances and &s;ecure their properties and con&s;titutional rights, &s;olemnly di&s;|claiming every idea of e&s;tabli&s;hing an independent em|pire, it gave a different turn to my thoughts. I reflect|ed that our ance&s;tors have fought many battles, and &s;hed torrents of blood in &s;upport of their con&s;titutional rights, and whatever may have been the fate of arbitrary princes, the con&s;titution was ever held &s;acred, the in&s;tance of Charles's reign only excepted. The Whigs were then obliged to join with the Tories, in re&s;toring royalty in its lu&s;tre to get rid of a phantom which the Independents had rai&s;ed under the name of liberty. The hope of a re-union with our brethren of Great Britain, and of the increa&s;ing grandeur and pro&s;perity of the whole empire, to me, I confe&s;s, had &s;omething agreeable in it. I there|fore with eagerne&s;s inve&s;tigated the propo&s;ed plan of operations, to enable me to judge of the probable event,
<PB N="146" REF="024456_0153_0FC77139AC2E8C00">
and I found, or thought I found, the &s;ecurity of our li|berties, in connection with Great Britain almo&s;t certainly attainable; at any rate more practicable than the e&s;tabli&s;h|ing an independent &s;tate; for the following among other rea&s;ons; that the people of America were determinately united in &s;upport of that mea&s;ure; that every in&s;ult and injury from admini&s;tration only tended to animate and cement; that the greate&s;t trading cities and mo&s;t re&s;pec|table characters in England are our friends; that even our enemies in parliament dare not &s;tand the attack on the proper ground; but, in order to carry their point, have always in&s;i&s;ted we were aiming at independency. That the belief of this is the &s;ole rea&s;on we have any enemies among the people of England, and though I am of opinion, the governing powers of Britain would ra|ther lo&s;e the colonies totally, than yield one iota of their preten&s;ions, the people will think very differently when convinced our views extend no further than to the &s;ecu|rity of tho&s;e rights, which they them&s;elves hold e&s;&s;ential to liberty. That it would be impo&s;&s;ible for government to carry on a war again&s;t the inclinations, and &s;o de&s;truc|tive to the intere&s;ts of the people, as the pre&s;ent mu&s;t obviou&s;ly appear, when it is remembered, the cau&s;e of our conte&s;t is the a&s;&s;umed power of parliament, to tax the colonies, to alter our forms of government, to tran&s;|port us to Britain for the trial of &s;uppo&s;ed offences, and to make laws, regulating our internal police. That the &s;word would even drop from the hand of a Briti&s;h &s;ol|dier, if he believed it pointed again&s;t the brea&s;t of a man contending for his birth-right. That an attempt to e&s;ta|bli&s;h an independency would unite England as one man again&s;t us; and though &s;he is burdened with an enor|mous debt, and deprived of a mo&s;t valuable branch of commerce, &s;he has &s;till great re&s;ources; and it is not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee the con&s;equences of the utmo&s;t exertions of her power. Be&s;ides, it appears to be the intere&s;t of Europe, that America &s;hould remain dependent. The power and importance of England, which by a defection of the colonies, &s;he would lo&s;e, is nece&s;&s;ary in the Euro|pean
<PB N="147" REF="024456_0154_0FC7713B46244BD0">
&s;y&s;tem. Holland and Portugal, I think, owe their political exi&s;tence to her; and even tho&s;e &s;tates which might wi&s;h to &s;ee her depre&s;&s;ed, were their intere&s;ts con|fined to Europe, would dread greater evils from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an independent empire in North Ame|rica, the certain con&s;equences of which would be, I ap|prehend, the lo&s;s of Mexico, South America, and the We&s;t India I&s;lands, to whom&s;oever belonging. But it is a nece&s;&s;ary enquiry, on what terms can our difference be adju&s;ted which will &s;ecure us from future conte&s;ts? I an&s;wer, it is impo&s;&s;ible. The nature of human affairs is &s;uch, that no political &s;y&s;tem can be e&s;tabli&s;hed which the folly of weak, or ambition of wicked men will not in time &s;ubvert. Let Great Britain relinqui&s;h her claim of internal legi&s;lation and taxation; let &s;tated times be limited for the holding and duration of a&s;&s;emblies, and coun&s;ellors, dependent on the Crown, he deprived of legi&s;lative powers, or hold their places during life; and let &s;upreme judges be appointed in each colony, to hold their places during good behaviour, with certain and ad|equate &s;alaries. All this would be no real injury to Eng|land, the only advantage &s;he ever did, or ever can receive from America is her commerce, an equitable &s;hare of which ought to be &s;ecured to her by a grand commercial &s;y&s;tem, to be agreed on by the legi&s;lators of the two countries, and to remain unalterable, except by mutual con&s;ent. Such a plan of accommodation, I think, of|fers as fair for the permanent &s;ecurity of peace, wealth, and liberty, as any I have heard, or can devi&s;e for the government of America in an independent &s;tate. I take it for granted, as I have never heard it di&s;puted, that a popular or democratic government mu&s;t take place, which in its mo&s;t perfect &s;tate, I think much inferior to the mixed government of Britain; for I hold it as maxim, that wherever the &s;upreme power is ve&s;ted in one man, or one body of men, the liberty of the &s;ubject is at be&s;t precarious. It appears from hi&s;tory, that popular fury is as formidable, and often exerci&s;ed with as much inju&s;tice as royal indignation. Frequent elections are no &s;ecurity
<PB N="148" REF="024456_0155_0FC7713CB5E32A80">
in this ca&s;e, the &s;pirit of the people always influences the repre&s;entative body, and if a man becomes unpopular, however innocent, his ruin is inevitable. To you I need not give in&s;tances; neither is it po&s;&s;ible in &s;uch a con&s;ti|tution, to render the judicial powers totally independent. The &s;ame body of men who have the appointment of the judges, having al&s;o the power of removing them, will car|ry popular prejudice even to the &s;eats of ju&s;tice. In this re&s;pect, England has the advantage of all other nations. In cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate hours, the three branches of the le|gi&s;lature concur in enacting laws for the general good of the community. The meane&s;t &s;ubject cannot be puni&s;hed unle&s;s he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es tho&s;e laws, neither can the judges be di&s;placed for faithfully executing them, without the like concurrence. This protects individuals equally from po|pular violence, and the arbitrary mea&s;ures of kings and courtiers. But is America capable of receiving a democra|tic government? Have we that indu&s;try, frugality, oecono|my, that virtue which is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute it? Laws and con&s;titutions mu&s;t be adapted to the manners of the people; they do not, they cannot form them. Whenever the manners change, the laws change with them, or lo&s;e their force. Is not North America too exten&s;ive for a popular government? But I find the &s;pirit of the times is again&s;t a union; we mu&s;t then become a confederacy of republics, each having &s;upreme powers within it&s;elf. Does not this afford a pro&s;pect of perpetual wars and internal feuds, till &s;ome one colony, or perhaps one man, becomes ma&s;ter of the whole continent? Recur to the hi&s;toric page, and point out the age and country where this, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, has not been the ca&s;e? The united provinces being &s;urrounded by more power|erful &s;tates, materially di&s;tingui&s;hes their &s;ituation from that of the&s;e colonies. A congre&s;s or general council for regulating the affairs of the whole confederacy will hardly be &s;ufficient to maintain peace. There was a general council of the Engli&s;h Heptarchy, yet that i&s;land was an uninterrupted &s;cene of blood and &s;laughter, till uni|ted under one head. There is a general diet of the Ger|man

<OPENER><DATELINE>Stafford, <DATE>Feb. 5th, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after I had waited upon you at Phi|ladelphia, I proceeded to New-York, and finding much difficulty in pur&s;uing my intended journey, I delivered your di&s;patches to Mr. Lewis, by direction of Mr. Van B. Li|ving&s;ton, and wrote to you at my return, acquainting you therewith. I have not wrote to you &s;o frequently as I would do, imagining that your time might be employed better, in matters of greater moment to the public; and where public utility is in que&s;tion, apologies become un|nece&s;&s;ary; be plea&s;ed therefore to accept the following hints from one who has &s;een &s;ervice. I am amazed at a &s;hip or two laying at New-York for &s;ome time pa&s;t; I never &s;aw two ve&s;&s;els that lay in more danger were they attacked, and they al&s;o know it. The A&s;ia lay long in the North-River, and refu&s;ed to go into the Sound, until Parker, a &s;enior captain, was &s;ent with a &s;hip to rein|force him, with po&s;itive orders from the admiral to join; it may al&s;o be &s;een by their writing to the mayor, and by Parker's threatening and bullying the town. There are three ways of taking or de&s;troying the&s;e &s;hips, could it be kept &s;ecret: Fir&s;t, by boarding; for as the A&s;ia mu&s;t ground at low water, the &s;prings upon cables would be of no u&s;e; and, I apprehend, that her lower guns could not range over the wharf when aground, there|fore a few guns with grape-&s;hot, run down upon the wharfs, upon her bow and quarters, would effectually &s;weep and clear her decks, while the people boarded. Secondly, if there were mortars of even guns to throw combu&s;tible matter on the decks, into the rigging, to &s;tick on her &s;ides, with grape as before, to prevent extingui&s;h|ment, the guns with the grape would be out of the power of her guns while aground. The third and be&s;t method, as I imagine, I would undertake my&s;elf, with a rea&s;ona|ble per&s;on to command the detachment, as &s;econd in command, or engineer, or conductor of the works, or, as I told you, in any character, &s;o that I might be &s;ervicea|ble to the cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="024456_0158_0FC77145AC00A9E8">The method I will here lay down to the be&s;t of my ability; there is Long-I&s;land and Nutten-I&s;land, well &s;ituated to place guns; and, I imagine, three or four hundred men would be &s;ufficient to compleat in one night all the nece&s;&s;ary works: The greate&s;t difficulty would be, to get cannon to Nutten-I&s;land, but they might come from the Narrows by night in flats. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would be impo&s;&s;ible to point out either the facilities or difficulties of the undertaking in the cour&s;e of a letter; the greate&s;t difficulty will be, to keep it &s;ecret from the people of Staten-I&s;land, Long-I&s;land, and New-York. If this mat|ter is not &s;oon put in execution, they will be reinforced, or they will fall into the North-River; but if there was lodgment with &s;ome guns upon Nutten-I&s;land, with the town battery to a&s;&s;i&s;t, they could not get out with|out running aground.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the batteries upon Long-I&s;land begin to play, there &s;hould be &s;ome of the Connecticut men, or &s;ome others, ready to run down upon the wharfs, with &s;ome few guns a-head and a-&s;tern, with grape, to clear the decks, and fire into the ports. While loading, the batteries will have this advantage, that they can play by night if clear; this method will &s;o harra&s;s and di&s;able them that they mu&s;t &s;trike quickly or they will be board|ed. When this affair is fini&s;hed the men &s;hould imme|diately march to the Narrows, and erect a battery that would keep all out, and all in; twenty guns, properly di&s;po&s;ed, would &s;ink any ve&s;&s;el that would dare attempt to go up, and would be out of the range of all &s;hot from the &s;hipping. Your crui&s;ers would find &s;helter and a good harbour. Had this been done la&s;t &s;ummer, our enemies at Bo&s;ton would have &s;tarved before now. There &s;hould be a camp formed there early in the &s;pring, and two &s;trong forts erected with retrenchments to cover them; for you may depend upon it, there will be a vi|gorous pu&s;h made early to get up the North River; works upon each &s;ide would greatly retard and delay their operations; and I doubt not, but defeat the de&s;ign of the campaign. To attack both they mu&s;t divide their
<PB N="152" REF="024456_0159_0FC771494D36DFA0">
army, which would greatly harra&s;s them; and if they wait to attack them one after another, the campaign is lo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, be&s;ides, the attacks made upon them at landing within the vicinity, and perhaps under cover of the&s;e forts and re|trenchments; al&s;o the attacks on their rear, while they are attacking the works. In &s;hort, we have every thing in our favour, to defeat the en&s;uing campaign, if we only begin in time, and conduct matters properly.</P>
<P>You want nothing but experienced officers, five h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|dred at lea&s;t. But to return to the men of war,&mdash;that I find &s;o much intimidates the people of this country, is a well con&s;tructed floating battery, formidable and pow|erful in her own element at &s;ea, no doubt; but when oppo&s;ed to the land, only an egg-&s;hell. Batteries and guns properly placed will &s;oon &s;ilence them. I will here de&s;cribe, as well as I can, the batteries of late made u&s;e of again&s;t &s;hipping; the old batteries in our ports and harbours at home are found almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s. As they are all built &s;imilar or like that at New-York, very low and near the water, whereby the ve&s;&s;el has all the power over them that &s;he could wi&s;h, not only from her great guns, but &s;mall arms; whereas, quite the rever&s;e ought to be the ca&s;e; the batteries &s;hould be fixed at a di&s;tance from the water and ve&s;&s;el, no nearer than two hundered yards if the ground will admit, from the channel, or where the ve&s;&s;el is to anchor or &s;ail, and upon ground high enough to be out of the range of her &s;hot, if &s;uch ground cannot be found take the highe&s;t you can get, and &s;ink, or let in your platforms and guns upon the top or &s;ummit of the hill, the muzzels of the guns, as it were, peeping out of the hill. Thus the men will work their guns when thus &s;ituated with facility and &s;afety, and out of the reach of all &s;hot. There is no &s;hip in the world that would dare offer to attack or pa&s;s &s;uch a battery, if twenty guns were mounted. The&s;e are the kind of bat|teries that I would propo&s;e for all attacks upon ve&s;&s;els, and what I would make u&s;e of, upon Long-I&s;land and Nutten-I&s;land, and though the land is not &s;o high as may be wi&s;hed, yet the &s;inking and letting in the guns into

I have here thrown a few matters together, in a rough manner; however, I &s;hall not needle&s;sly make any apology for troubling you, as the intention is good. I can a&s;&s;ure you, that the&s;e hints, as I call them, are no whim, or production of my own, but are drawn from real practice and experience, which I have often &s;een and helped to execute in rivers, lakes, and harbours, during twenty-eight years &s;ervice. I cannot di&s;mi&s;s the Narrows; the enemy &s;hould not be al|lowed to &s;lip into the heart of the country, without gain|ing it by inches: the Narrows are centrical, and the peo|ple thereabouts di&s;po&s;ed to be trouble&s;ome; it is a mo&s;t de&s;irable &s;ituation for an army, as they can act either to the Ea&s;tward, or We&s;tward, together, or &s;eparate, and &s;upplies can come from all quarters either by land or wa|ter. A battery placed as beforementioned has great power and command of &s;hipping; one &s;hot fired in this

<P>THE bearer, Mon&s;. Arundel, is directed by the Con|gre&s;s to repair to General Schuyler, in order to be em|ployed by him in the Artillery &s;ervice. He propo&s;es to wait on you in his way, and has reque&s;ted me to intro|duce him by a line to you. He has been an officer in the French &s;ervice, as you will &s;ee by his commi&s;&s;ions; and profe&s;&s;ing a good-will to our cau&s;e, I hope he may be u&s;eful in in&s;tructing our gunners and matro&s;&s;es: per|haps he may advi&s;e in opening the nailed cannon.</P>
<P>I received the enclo&s;ed, the other day, from an officer, Mr. Newland, who &s;erved in the two la&s;t wars, and was
<PB N="155" REF="024456_0162_0FC771515915C0C0">
known by General Gates, who &s;poke well of him to me when I was at Cambridge. He is de&s;irous now of en|tering into your &s;ervice. I have advi&s;ed him to wait upon you at New-York.</P>
<P>They &s;till talk big in England, and threaten hard; but their language is &s;omewhat civiller, at lea&s;t, not quite &s;o di&s;re&s;pectful to us. By degrees they come to their &s;en&s;es, but too late, I fancy for their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>We have got a large quantity of &s;alt-petre, one hun|dred and twenty ton, and thirty more expected. Pow|der-mills are now wanting; I believe we mu&s;t &s;et to work and make it by hand. But I &s;till wi&s;h, with you, that pikes could be introduced, and I would add bows and arrows: the&s;e were good weapons, not wi&s;ely laid a&s;ide:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Becau&s;e a man may &s;hoot as truly with a bow as with a common mu&s;ket.</P>
<P N="2">2d. He can di&s;charge four arrows in the time of charg|ing and di&s;charging one bullet.</P>
<P N="3">3d. His object is not taken from his view by the &s;moke of his own &s;ide.</P>
<P N="4">4th. A flight of arrows &s;een coming upon them, ter|rifies and di&s;turbs the enemies' attention to his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5th. An arrow &s;triking in any part of a man puts him <HI>hors du combat</HI> till it is extracted.</P>
<P N="6">6th. Bows and arrows are more ea&s;ily provided every where than mu&s;kets and ammunition.</P>
<P>Polydore Virgil, &s;peaking of one of our battles again&s;t the French in Edward the Third's reign, mentions the great confu&s;ion the enemy was thrown into, <HI>&s;agittarum nube,</HI> from the Engli&s;h; and concludes, <HI>E&s;t res profecto dictu mirabiles, ut tantus ac potens exercitus a &s;olis fer&egrave; Anglicis &s;agittariis victus fuerit; adeo Anglus e&s;t &s;agitti potens, et id genus armorum valet.</HI> If &s;o much execution was done by arrows when men wore &s;ome defen&s;ive ar|mour, how much more might be done now that is out of u&s;e!</P>
<P>I am glad you come to New-York, but I al&s;o wi&s;h you could be in Canada. There is a kind of &s;u&s;pen&s;e
<PB N="156" REF="024456_0163_0FC7715340B4C558">
in men's minds, here at pre&s;ent, waiting to &s;ee what terms will be offered from England. I expect none that we can accept; and when that is generally &s;een, we &s;hall be more unanimous and more deci&s;ive: then your pro|po&s;ed &s;olemn league and covenant will go better down, and perhaps mo&s;t of your other &s;trong mea&s;ures adopted.</P>
<P>I am always glad to hear from you, but I do not de|&s;erve your favours, being &s;o bad a corre&s;pondent. My eyes will now hardly &s;erve me to write by night, and the&s;e &s;hort days have been all taken up by &s;uch variety of bu&s;ine&s;s, that I &s;eldom can &s;it down ten minutes without interruption.&mdash;God give you &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour to inclo&s;e you &s;undry re&s;oluti|ons of Congre&s;s, by which you will perceive, it is the de|&s;ire of Congre&s;s, that you &s;hould repair to Canada, and take upon you the command of the army of the United Colonies in that province. I need not mention the im|portance of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you, and the happy ef|fects it will have in &s;ecuring the liberty of America, if you &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to drive our enemies, the enemies of liberty and the rights of mankind, out of it. I heartily pray, that the Di&s;po&s;er of Events may grant you &s;ucce&s;s equal to your merit and zeal.</P>
<P>As you will want battering cannon, which are not to be had in that province, you are to apply to the Conven|tion, or Committee of Safety of New-York; to whom by this opportunity, I &s;end the recommendation of Con|gre&s;s to &s;upply you with twelve, &s;uch as you &s;hall judge mo&s;t &s;uitable, and &s;ome mortars, if they have or can procure them; with balls, &s;hells, and other nece&s;&s;aries; and al&s;o to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in forwarding them. Eight tons of powder are now on the way to Albany, for the forces in Canada; and as a very con&s;iderable quantity of &s;alt-petre is &s;ent to the mills of Mr. Wi&s;ner and Mr. Living|&s;tone, &s;hould there be occa&s;ion for more, you will be &s;upplied from thence.</P>
<P>You will readily perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of conferring with General Schuyler, and with him con&s;ulting on the be&s;t methods of having nece&s;&s;aries conveyed to you acro&s;s the lakes.

<SALUTE>DEAR GENERAL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>La&s;t night I had the plea&s;ure to receive yours of the 15th. I am rejoiced you have weathered this fit of the gout; I don't think you will have another this winter, if you was careful in letting that pa&s;s off: it may probably be of much &s;ervice to your con&s;titution. When I menti|oned Canada, I did not mean you &s;hould winter there; if you can &s;ecure the entrance into it, by getting Quebec, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it this &s;ummer, you may leave the care of that province to your Brigadiers for the winter to come. The General was plea&s;ed you wrote to him, as he began to think you tardy. He writes to you by this expre&s;s. I like your intention of making the fort an open redoubt; I think &s;ome heavy guns upon the &s;outh and we&s;t &s;ides, with good &s;od merlons, will make the men of war keep aloof. It is a pretty high &s;ituation, and battering it at a di&s;tance, over the lower batteries, would have but little effect. We have lately had rea&s;ons to &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Howe had thoughts of leaving Bo&s;ton; the General will tell you his rea&s;ons for thinking that was intended. Clinton, I am &s;atisfied, went to &s;ee how affairs were circum&s;tan|ced at New-York, to con&s;ult with Tryon, and to prepare the way for Howe's reception. Unle&s;s the enemy re|po&s;&s;e&s;s Canada, they cannot rein&s;tate the king's affairs on this continent; there is no way to recover Canada, but by the Rivers of St. Laurence and Hud&s;on. The St. Laurence is not practicable until late in May; there|fore, the fir&s;t attempt would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be made at New-York: for the&s;e rea&s;ons, I think your hands &s;hould be &s;trengthened as much, and as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible. I am afraid you are deficient in gun-carriages; employ all the hands you can procure to make them. I am glad you expre&s;s your&s;elf &s;o well plea&s;ed with the Captains, Smith and Badlam; the former has good talents, and will, I hope, prove as faithful as he is capable. Ere long it will be known if I am right in my conjecture, that the great body of the enemy mean to endeavour to take po&s;t at, or near, New-York. Should that happen to be attempted, be a&s;&s;ured we &s;hall march with the utmo&s;t expedition

to &s;upport you. I expect &s;oon to &s;ee Palfrey, in con&s;e|quence of what I wrote to him, when I hope to hear you are in perfect health. Little Eu&s;tace is well, but nothing is done for him as yet. You know the more than Scotch partiality of the&s;e folks. I have had much to do to &s;upport the lad you put into Colonel Whitcomb's regiment. They have no complaint in nature again&s;t him, but that he is too good an officer. What, in the name of rea&s;on, can Hite have trumped up to com|mence a &s;uit in Chancery upon? Mrs. Gates and I have puzzled our brains to find it out. The inclo&s;ed I de&s;ire you will order to be immediately delivered to the po&s;tma&s;ter. Mrs. Gates joins me in every good wi&s;h for your health and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR LEE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of the 5th ult. from William&s;burgh, the fir&s;t I have received from you &s;ince you left this city, came to my hands by the la&s;t po&s;t. I thank you for your kind congratulations on our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bo&s;ton. I thank you for your good wi&s;hes in our future operati|ons, and hope that every diabolical attempt to deprive mankind of their inherent rights and privileges, whether made in the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, or South, will be at|tended with di&s;appointment and di&s;grace, and that the authors in the end will be brought to &s;uch puni&s;hment, as an injured people have a right to inflict.</P>
<P>General Howe's retreat from Bo&s;ton was precipitate, beyond any thing I could have conceived. The de&s;truc|tion of the &s;tores at Dunbar's camp after Braddock's de|feat was but a faint image of what was &s;een at Bo&s;ton; artillery carts cut to pieces in one place; gun carriages in another; &s;hells broke here; &s;hot buried there, and every thing carrying with it the face of di&s;order and con|fu&s;ion, as al&s;o of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Immediately upon their embarkation, I detached a brigade of five regiments to this city, and upon their &s;ailing, removed with the whole army hither except four regiments at Bo&s;ton, and one at Beverley, &amp;c. for the protection of tho&s;e places, the &s;tores and barracks there, and for erecting works for defending the harbour of the fir&s;t. Immediately upon my arrival here I detached four regiments by order of Congre&s;s to Canada (to wit, Poor's, Patter&s;on's, Treaton's, and Bond's) under the command of Brigadier Thomp&s;on, and &s;ince that, by the &s;ame authority, and in con&s;equence of &s;ome unfavoura|ble accounts from that quarter, General Sullivan and &s;ix other regiments, namely, Stark's, Reed's, Wain's, Irvine's, Wind's, and Dayton's, have moved off for that department; the four la&s;t regiments are of Penn&s;ylvania, and New-Jer&s;ey. The fir&s;t brigade arrived at Albany the twenty-fourth ultimo, and were moving on, when accounts came from thence the twenty-&s;eventh. The other brigades mu&s;t all be at Albany before this, as &s;ome
<PB N="163" REF="024456_0170_0FC771652E5C5110">
of the regiments &s;ailed ten days ago, and the la&s;t four, and the winds very favourable. This has left us very weak at this place, whil&s;t I have my fears that the rein|forcement will &s;carce get to Canada in time, for want of teams to tran&s;port the troops, &amp;c. to Fort George, and ve&s;&s;els to convey them on afterwards.</P>
<P>We have done a great deal of work at this place. In a fortnight more, I think the city will be in a very re&s;|pectable po&s;ture of defence. Governor's-I&s;land has a large and &s;trong work erected, and a regiment encamp|ed there. The point below, called Red-Hook, has a &s;mall, but exceeding &s;trong barbet battery; and &s;everal new works are con&s;tructed, and many of them almo&s;t executed at other places.</P>
<P>General Ward, upon the evacuation of Bo&s;ton, and finding there was a probability of his removing from the &s;moke of his own chimney, applied to me, and wrote to Congre&s;s for leave to re&s;ign. A few days afterwards, &s;ome of the officers, as he &s;ays, getting <HI>unea&s;y</HI> at the pro&s;|pect of his leaving them, he applied for his letter of re|&s;ignation, which had been committed to my care; but, behold! it had been carefully f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rwarded to Congre&s;s, and, as I have &s;ince learnt, judged &s;o rea&s;onable (<HI>want of health</HI> being the plea) that it was in&s;tantly complied with. Brigadier Fry, previous to this, al&s;o conceiving that there was nothing entertaining or profitable to an old man, to be marching and counter-marching, de&s;ired, immediately on the evacuation of Bo&s;ton (which hap|pened on the 17th of March) that he might <HI>re&s;ign his commi&s;&s;ion on the</HI> 11<HI>th of April:</HI> the choice of the day became a matter of great &s;peculation, and remained pro|foundly my&s;terious till he exhibited his account, when there appeared neither more or le&s;s in it, than the com|pletion of three calendar months; the pay of which he received without any kind of compunction, although he had never done one tour of duty, or, I believe, had ever been out of his hou&s;e from the time he entered till he quitted Cambridge.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="024456_0171_0FC77167726DE980">So much for two Generals: I have next to inform you, that the Pay-ma&s;ter-general, Colonel Warren, not finding it convenient to attend the army, from the vari|ous employments and avocations in which he was engag|ed, al&s;o re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, and is &s;ucceeded by your old aid, Palfrey.</P>
<P>When I was &s;peaking of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the king's troops, and the Tories, at their evacuation of Bo&s;ton, I might have gone on, and added, that their mi&s;|fortunes did not end here. It &s;eems, upon their arrival at Halifax, many of the former wore obliged to encamp, although the ground was covered deep with &s;now; and the latter, to pay &s;ix dollars a week for &s;orry upper-rooms, and &s;tow in them, men, women, and children, as thick, comparitively, as the hair upon their heads. This induced many of the&s;e gentry to return, and throw them&s;elves upon the mercy and clemency of their coun|trymen, who were for &s;ending them immediately back, as the propere&s;t and &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment they could inflict, but death being preferred to this, they now wait, in confinement, any other that may be thought due to &s;uch parricides.</P>
<P>All the &s;hips of war have left this place, and gone down to the Hook, except the A&s;ia, which lays five miles below the Narrows, and about twelve or fourteen from hence. I could have added more, but my paper will not admit of it.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HEARTILY thank you for you letter, and regret that I cannot have the plea&s;ure of meeting you; the great wi&s;h of my life is to &s;ee peace between two coun|tries I almo&s;t equally love, while it is a que&s;tion whether this or an inexterminable war is to take place. I meant in words I had learnt from you, to &s;et before you the ma|ny and mutual advantages both would derive from an agreement; and as the terms now offered are more for the intere&s;t of your favourite America than you ever ho|ped to obtain, I &s;hould have made no &s;cruple to a&s;k your good offices, and to engage my own, to remove any ob|&s;tacles that might ob&s;truct the peace.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think it a greater honour to contribute in the &s;malle&s;t degree to this, than to have the greate&s;t &s;hare in bringing about victory: the&s;e, to a thinking man like you, who has many friends on both &s;ides, &s;ubject him to a double regret.</P>
<P>I may not find another occa&s;ion of meeting you ea&s;ily, but I would travel far to have the plea&s;ure of embracing you, as a fellow &s;ubject of the &s;ame empire, and a friend. You will &s;ee by &s;ome &s;peeches in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that others whom you value have the &s;ame wi&s;h. A ce|lebrated poem, ju&s;t publi&s;hed, &s;ays,
<Q>By virtue, captive Lee is doubly ble&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>A pamphlet wrote by Governor John&s;tone's brother is much applauded by the nation, where a &s;pirit prevails like that between tender relations who are more di&s;po&s;ed to love and re&s;pect, after a quarrel has convinced both, of the advantage and value of friend&s;hip. I &s;end you the pamphlet.</P>
<P>You do Sir H.

<OPENER><DATELINE>William&s;burgh, <DATE>July 12th, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR GENERAL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR kind concern for my health made me happy, and the high approbation you expre&s;s of my public con|duct highly gratified my pride. I had the plea&s;ure of receiving your letter which did me &s;o much honour, about the 9th of la&s;t month. I was then at Mr. Har|ri&s;on's near Peter&s;burgh, where I had gone with Mrs. Page for the recovery of her health. Our trip happily has an&s;wered our wi&s;hes, and we are once more fixed at William&s;burgh. It is now four weeks &s;ince we have received any certain account of the &s;ituation of affairs in either of the Carolinas. Even your letter to brigadier Lewis countermanding the march of the troops did not arrive here till four weeks after it was written. The regiments had ju&s;t began their march; but had they not been &s;cattered abroad on di&s;tant &s;tations, and badly provided with nece&s;&s;aries for &s;uch an expedition, they would have reached the place of their de&s;tination before your expre&s;s could have &s;topped them. It will be worth your while to examine into the occa&s;ion of this. I thought it a matter of &s;o much importance to have &s;uch orders communicated with di&s;patch, that I advi&s;ed the briga|dier to &s;end an expre&s;s to you immediately, to inform you of the unaccountable delay that yours had met with, and to recommend it to you to e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t through|out your di&s;trict; but he was preparing for an expedi|tion again&s;t Gwynn-I&s;land, The brigadier &s;et out la&s;t Monday on his way to our camp, attended by the Colo|ne&s;s Woodford, Stephens, Buckner, Weedon, and &s;ome others, intending to examine into the &s;trength of the enemy, and &s;ubmit the propriety of an attack to a coun|cil of war. They reached the camp that night, and the next day finding that the Dunmore had changed &s;tations with the other, and had expo&s;ed her&s;elf very prettily to the very place where he had been preparing a battery for the Otter, they determined not to lo&s;e this good op|portunity of beginning their cannonade, in which they might &s;everely and principally cha&s;ti&s;e the noble Earl. At eight o'clock, A. M. Captain Arundel and Lieute|nant
<PB N="169" REF="024456_0176_0FC77177346CBEF0">
Denny &s;aluted the Dunmore and Otter, with two eighteen pounders; the very fir&s;t &s;hot at the Otter, though a full mile from our battery, &s;truck her, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, between wind and water, for &s;he did not re|turn the fire, but was towed off on the careen. The Dunmore fired a broad&s;ide, and then was towed off, having received four &s;hot through her &s;ides; whil&s;t &s;he was in tow, &s;he received a fifth through her &s;tern which raked her; &s;carcely a &s;hot was fired which did not do execution in &s;ome part of the fleet. A &s;chooner lo&s;t one of her ma&s;ts. Whil&s;t lieutenant Denny was firing on the fleet, their battery on the i&s;land began to play on him, and a ball pa&s;&s;ed through the embra&s;ure; on which he immediately turned his cannon on their battery; for he had taken the precaution to have &s;cope enough to take in the fleet, and that part of their battery; and fired three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into their embra&s;ure, which three rounds compleatly &s;ilenced that part of the battery; the other part facing our lines on the haven was almo&s;t as &s;oon &s;ilenced by our battery erected again&s;t with four nines and three &s;ix pounders. Part of their camp was a little expo&s;ed to both of our batteries which fired a few rounds into it. This fire was as well directed as that a|gain&s;t their &s;hips; for it beat down many of their tents, and threw their camp into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. When this was di&s;covered, the brigadier ordered canoes to be brought down, to enable the men to pa&s;s over into the i&s;land; for, unhappily, we had not a boat on the &s;hore: the&s;e could not be procured till the next day, when a &s;mart cannonade began between the batteries; but as &s;oon as our men had manned their boats, their fire cea&s;|ed, and they retired with precipitation to their boats, and e&s;caped &s;afely to their &s;hips, having fir&s;t broken off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mons, &amp;c. of their cannon. There were three ten|ders up the haven which could not pa&s;s our batteries; the&s;e they abandoned; they endeavoured to burn one, but our men boarded it, and extingui&s;hed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ames. I under&s;tand that all the&s;e tenders have their &s;wivels in them; but it is reported that they had thrown the guns
<PB N="170" REF="024456_0177_0FC7717D36990D00">
overboard. We are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land. The fleet has retired, but is in &s;ight. This might have been a compleat affair, if proper mea&s;ures had been precon|certed, and the whole tell conducted. Our men, how|ever, behaved well, our artillery was admirably &s;erved, and we have di&s;graced and mortified our enemies. In this affair we lo&s;t not a man; but mo&s;t unhappily poor Captain Arundel was killed by the bur&s;ting of a wood|en mortar, with which he was endeavouring to throw &s;hells into the fleet. His lo&s;s is irreparable. He be|haved with great &s;pirit and activity, and was &s;o hearty in our cau&s;e that he is univer&s;ally lamented. Colonel Stephens is ju&s;t returned from Gwynn's-I&s;land; he &s;ays the enemy carried off all their cannon from their bat|teries, except one &s;ix pounder, which they &s;piked. They left &s;ix carriage guns in one of the tenders; &s;everal ne|groes and a few whites were taken; two negroes and one of the fourteenth regiment de&s;erted to us. The pri|&s;oners inform, that Lord Dunmore's mate was cut in two by a double headed eighteen pounder, which al&s;o took off one man's arm and another's leg, and drove a &s;plinter into his lord&s;hip's leg. Tom Byrd was ill of a fever, and was carted off to a boat ju&s;t before our peo|ple landed. They were obliged to burn two fine &s;mall ve&s;&s;els that day, and at night, in the mouth of the river, they burnt al&s;o a large &s;hip, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Dunmore, as &s;he was not with the fleet next morning. The Fowey, it is &s;aid, was with the fleet, but did not chu&s;e to come within reach of our guns. The Roe-buck was at the mouth of Rappahannock. The Colonel &s;ays, when he came away, the whole fleet had &s;ailed, and were out of light, and it was uncertain where they are gone; &s;up|po&s;e to Maryland? They went off in a bad plight, with out bi&s;cuit or water. Their works were found of excel|lent con&s;truction and con&s;iderable extent; they were preparing to build hou&s;es and a wind-mill: the had made a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t collection of materials for different works; their tents, which they moved off except one marquee, which was left in their hurry, and through which a can|non

ball had pa&s;&s;ed, were capable of containing about &s;even or eight hundred men. From many circum&s;tan|ces it is evident they meant to &s;tay there a con&s;iderable time. I have been interrupted in writing, and before I could return to my &s;crawl, I had the happine&s;s to re|ceive your letter of the third of July. I mo&s;t heartily congratulate you on your &s;ucce&s;s; it was a mo&s;t glorious affair&mdash;a noble defence! The Briti&s;h navy has been hap|pily checked in her proud career, and has received a mo&s;t ju&s;t and complete cha&s;ti&s;ement. What mu&s;t the king think now? The whole continent in arms again&s;t him, &s;even hundred and fifty of his favourite highlanders, in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and his fleets repul&s;ed and di&s;graced along our coa&s;ts for two thou&s;and miles! I hope he will repent and be contented to put up with the lo&s;s of Ame|rica, or, if he does not, that he may meet with repeated di&s;appointment. The Marylanders were rou&s;ed by the re&s;olve of our Convention, and have lectured their repre|&s;entatives &s;o well, that they have unanimou&s;ly voted for independence&mdash;they have no occa&s;ion for our rifle-men on that account: However I can a&s;&s;ure you, on the Ea&s;t|ern &s;hore of Maryland there has been a con&s;iderable in|&s;urrection of Tories, in&s;omuch that Colonel Fleming has been obliged to march with a hundred and twenty men to quell them. We have not yet heard the event of that affair. I have ju&s;t now received another letter from you, and am delighted with your de&s;cription of the bra|very of Colonel Moultrie and the garri&s;on of Fort-Sulli|van. It is not flattery, my dear General, when I tell you, that mo&s;t of us here attribute the glorious di&s;play of bravery on that day, to the animating pre&s;ence of a commander, who, independent of his great military abi|lities and experience, appeared to be the evil genius of Clinton, who had followed him, and from who&s;e pre|&s;ence he had &s;eemed to retire and retreat along the coa&s;t, from Bo&s;ton to Charle&s;ton. All that I could do, as there were not gentlemen enough in town, to make a council, was to de&s;ire brigadier Lewis to &s;end immedi|ately

<SALUTE>DEAR GENERAL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It would take a volume to tell you how many clever things were &s;aid of you, and the brave troops under you command, after hearing of your late victory. It has given a wonderful turn to our affairs. The lo&s;s of Ca|nada had &s;truck the &s;pirits of many people, who now begin to think our cau&s;e is not abandoned, and that we &s;hall yet triumph over our enemies.</P>
<P>The declaration of independence has produced a new aera in this part of America. The militia of Penn&s;ylva|nia &s;eem to be actuated with a &s;pirit more than Roman. Near two thou&s;and citizens of Philadelphia have lately marched towards New-York, in order to prevent an in|cur&s;ion being made by our enemies upon the &s;tate of New-Jer&s;ey. The cry of them all <HI>is for bottle.</HI> I think Mr. Howe will not be able to get a footing in New-York, and that he will end the pre&s;ent, or begin the next cam|paign in Canada, or in &s;ome one of the Southern colo|nies;&mdash;the only places in which America is vulnerable. We depend upon Gates in the North, and <HI>you</HI> oblige us to hope for great things from the South.</P>
<P>The Tories quiet, but very &s;urly. Lord Howe's pro|clamation leaves them not a &s;ingle filament of their cob|web doctrine of reconciliation.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of liberty reigns triumphant in Penn&s;ylva|nia. The proprietary gentry have retired to their coun|try &s;eats, and hone&s;t men have taken the &s;eats they abu|&s;ed &s;o much in the government of our &s;tate.</P>
<P>The papers will inform you, that I have been thru&s;t into Congre&s;s. I find there is a great deal of difference

between &s;porting a &s;entiment in a letter, or over a gla&s;s of wine upon politics, and di&s;charging properly the duty of a &s;enator. I feel my&s;elf unequal to every part of my new &s;ituation, except where plain integrity is required.</P>
<P>My former letters to you, may pa&s;s hereafter for a leaf of the Sibyls. They are full of predictions; and, what is &s;till more uncommon, &s;ome of them have proved true. I &s;hall go on, and add, that I think the declaration of independence will produce union and new exertions in England in the &s;ame ratio that they have done in this country. The pre&s;ent campaign, I believe, is only de|&s;igned to train us for the duties of next &s;ummer.</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR LEE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING I &s;hall probably feel the effect, I do mo&s;t cordially and &s;incerely congratulate you on <HI>your</HI> victory over Clinton and the Briti&s;h &s;quadron at Sullivan's-I&s;land. A victory undoubtedly it is, when an enemy are drubbed, and driven from a country they were &s;ent to conquer. Such is the ca&s;e of Clinton and Sir Peter Parker, who are now with the fleet and army at Staten-I&s;land, where General Howe and the troops from Halifax have been ever &s;ince the la&s;t day of June, and Lord Howe &s;ince the twelfth of July. Some He&s;|&s;ians and a pretty many of the Scottish laddies have got in, and the re&s;idue of the fleet parted with, off the banks of Newfoundland, hourly expected. When the whole arrive, matters will &s;oon come to a deci&s;ion, every thing bong prepared on both &s;ides for the appeal, and on ours, I hope it will be ob&s;tinate, if not &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The latter, it is not in the power of mortals to com|mand; but they may endeavour to de&s;erve it; and this I am per&s;uaded, our troops will more than ever aim at,
<PB N="174" REF="024456_0181_0FC7718843DCB560">
as I have impre&s;&s;ed upon their minds the gallant beha|viour of the brave few, who defended Sullivan's-I&s;land.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, the enemy can bring more men to a point than we can, and when reinforced by the He&s;&s;ians with|out number, as unle&s;s the militia (fa&s;ter than heretofore) come into our aid, their numbers, when the He&s;&s;ians ar|rive, cannot, by the be&s;t intelligence we can get, fall &s;hort of twenty-five thou&s;and men. Ours are under twenty, very &s;ickly, and po&s;ted on Governor's-I&s;land, Long-I&s;land, at Powles-Hook, Horn's-Hook, and at the pa&s;s near King's-Bridge; more militia are expected, but whether they will be in time, time only can tell, as al&s;o where the point of attack will be. An opinion prevails, countenanced by hints from &s;ome of the principal Tories, and corroborated by intelligence from Staten-I&s;land, that part of the enemy's fleet and army will go into the Sound, whil&s;t another part of it runs up the North-River, there|by cutting off all communication by water with this place, whil&s;t their troops form a chain acro&s;s the neck, and &s;top an intercour&s;e with Connecticut by land: others think, they will not leave an army in their rear, whil&s;t they have the country in their front, getting by that means between two fires, unle&s;s it is extended as a feint to withdraw our troops from the city, that they may &s;lip in and po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of it: all this is but a field of conjecture.</P>
<P>Our affairs in the North have been growing from bad to wor&s;e, till I hope they will mend, as one great &s;ource of the evil is in a way of being removed, I mean, the &s;mall pox; but the army have retreated from place to place, till they are now got to Ticonderoga, oppo&s;ite to which, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Lake Champlain, they are about to e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t, which they &s;ay will be in|vulnerable; but whether it may be &s;omewhat like the man who built a mill on account of a beautiful fall, and then had to con&s;ider whether it was practicable to bring water to it, remains in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be determined, as it is the opinion of &s;ome (I know nothing of the country my&s;elf) that the enemy may pa&s;s this po&s;t and
<PB N="175" REF="024456_0182_0FC7718B2CB461B8">
get into Lake George, without receiving the lea&s;t annoy|ance from this work. Whether they would chu&s;e to leave a po&s;t in their rear without e&s;tabli&s;hing one them|&s;elves, &s;ufficient to keep it in awe, is the point in que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>It gives me a very &s;ingular plea&s;ure to hear of the gal|lant behaviour of your young aids, and Mr. Jenefer, as al&s;o of Colonels Moultrie and Thomp&s;on; to be the means at any time, of rewarding merit, will add greatly to my happine&s;s; and whenever you can point out a mode that can be abopted con&s;i&s;tently, you &s;hall find me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery ready: but you know the temper of the troops in this quarter, as well as I do, and how impracticable it is to bring in a per&s;on, let his merit be ever &s;o great, without throwing a whole corps into confu&s;ion. This will al&s;o apply to Captain Bullet. What vacancies there may be in your department that he has his eye to, and could be appointed to with propriety, you mu&s;t know better than I. That there is none here, I can under|take to &s;ay. I have no doubt but the Congre&s;s would annex the rank of colonel to his office of adjutant. I believe they have done it in the in&s;tance of Griffin, who is appointed deputy-adjutant to the flying camp. If this would add any thing to his &s;atisfaction, I &s;hould have no objection to the mention of it. With every wi&s;h for your pro&s;perity and &s;ucce&s;s, I remain with &s;incere regard,</P>

We do not yet know the lo&s;s of killed and wounded on either &s;ide; but I imagine it mu&s;t have been pretty con&s;iderable, as the engagement, at &s;ome parts of the lines, was of long continuance, and heavy.

<SALUTE>DEAR GENERAL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE letter you will receive with this contains my &s;en|timents with re&s;pect to your pre&s;ent &s;tation; but be&s;ides this, I have &s;ome additional rea&s;ons for mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;hing to have you where the principal &s;cene of action is laid. I do not mean to flatter nor prai&s;e you at the expence of any other, but, I confe&s;s, I do think that it is entirely owing to you, that this army and the liberties
<PB N="179" REF="024456_0186_0FC77198304573D0">
of America, &s;o far as they ate dependant on it, are not totally cut off. You have deci&s;ion, a quality often want|ing in minds otherwi&s;e valuable; and I a&s;cribe to this our e&s;cape from York-I&s;land, from King's-Bridge, and the Plains; and I have no doubt, had you been here, the gar|ri&s;on of Mount-Wa&s;hington would now have compo&s;ed a part of this army: and from all the&s;e circum&s;tances, I confe&s;s I ardently wi&s;h to &s;ee you removed from a place where I think there will be little call for your judgment and experience, to the place where they are likely to be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary. Nor am I &s;ingular in my opinion, every gentleman of the family, the officers, and &s;oldiers, ge|nerally, have a confidence in you: the enemy con&s;tantly enquire where you are, and &s;eem to me to be le&s;s confi|dent when you are pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Colonel Cadwaliader, through a &s;pecial indulgence, on account of &s;ome civilities &s;hewn by his family to General Pre&s;cot, has been liberated from New-York without any parole. He informs, that the enemy have a &s;outhern ex|pedition in view; that they hold us very cheap in con&s;e|quence of the late affair at Mount-Wa&s;hington, where both the plan of defence and execution wore contempti|ble. If a real defence of the lines was intended, the num|ber was too few; if the Fort only, the garri&s;on was too numerous by half. General Wa&s;hington's own judg|ment, &s;econded by repre&s;entations from us, would, I be|lieve, have &s;aved the men and their arms: but, unluckily, General Green's judgment was contrary. This kept the General's mind in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e till the &s;troke was &s;truck. Oh, General! an indeci&s;ive mind is one of the greate&s;t misfortunes that can befal an army: how often have I lamented it this campaign!</P>
<P>All circum&s;tances con&s;idered, we are in a very awful, alarming &s;tate, one that requires the utmo&s;t wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on will admit, I think your&s;elf and &s;ome others &s;hould go to Congre&s;s, and form the plan of the new army, point out their defects to them, and, if po&s;&s;ible, prevail on them to bind their whole attention

to this great object, even to the exclu&s;ion of every other. If they will not, or cannot, do this, I fear all our exertions will be vain in this part of the world. Foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance is &s;oliciting, but we cannot expect they will fight the whole battle.</P>
<P>I intended to have &s;aid more, but the expre&s;s is wait|ing, and I mu&s;t conclude with my clear and explicit opinion, that your pre&s;ence is of the la&s;t importance.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your favour of the 18th ult. and can a&s;&s;ure you, that of the merit or demerit of your con|duct in the affair of Monmouth, on the 28th of June, I have not to this day framed any opinion. I have &s;o lit|tle lei&s;ure to attend to the military operations of Ameri|ca, and am &s;o incompetent a judge of the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the character of a general, that I make no judgment at all. But without admitting or de|nying that you have made greater &s;acrifices in the cau&s;e of American freedom than any officer of our whole ar|my, without a &s;ingle exception, and that it is not le&s;s cer|tain that you have &s;aved our whole army more than once from de&s;truction (the proofs of which are not in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) I can a&s;&s;ure you, that I heartily di&s;approve of all publications containing per&s;onal reflections on the character of any gentleman, and e&s;pecially on tho&s;e of your rank, in the American army. And if what was pre&s;ented to the public, as a mere republication of a pa|per formerly printed by a Virginian, has been, as you &s;ay, republi&s;hed with many malicious alterations and ad|ditions, it is &s;till the more inexcu&s;able; becau&s;e all &s;uch alterations and additions, be&s;ides their particular malig|nity again&s;t you (for which alone I &s;hould condemn them) are an impo&s;ition upon the world; and it mu&s;t be con|&s;idered,
<PB N="182" REF="024456_0189_0FC7719D7389E4B8">
by every man of honour, be the legal con&s;truc|tion what it will, as a downright forgery. I can further a&s;&s;ure you, that I cannot but di&s;approve of Mr. Collins's in&s;erting the paper you refer to in his Gazette, not only becau&s;e no printer ought to make his pre&s;s a vehicle for per&s;onal &s;lander, but becau&s;e he &s;et out with a profe&s;&s;ed declaration again&s;t diverting his paper to &s;uch purpo&s;es, and has &s;o tenaciou&s;ly adhered to that maxim till the publication in que&s;tion, as to reject, if my information be true, &s;everal pieces on account of the per&s;onal reflec|tions they contained on gentlemen in the &s;ervice of the enemy, and which the law of retaliation would clearly have warranted him to in&s;ert. And I mu&s;t declare, in ju&s;tice to him, and from what I per&s;onally know of his humane di&s;po&s;ition, and his di&s;inclination to convey thro' the channel of his pre&s;s any thing injurious to the repu|tation of others, that I firmly believe, he has taken the paper, pre&s;ented to him as a copy of a republication in Virginia, for a true copy. And it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, by virtue of what law I know not, but perhaps by one as rational as that of deciding controver&s;ies by private combat, in civil communities which reprobate that mode of deci&s;ion, that a printer, by the bare republication of a paper, is not pre&s;umed to adopt the &s;entiments; and that, by di&s;clo&s;ing to the party aggrieved, at who&s;e in|&s;tance it was republi&s;hed, he always averts the indigna|tion of the &s;ufferer from him&s;elf to that per&s;on. I &s;hould, however, be very &s;orry to find any of our printers imi|tate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">actice of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in New-York, who, whether they excel us in military di&s;cipline and courage or not, have, to my certain knowledge, hitherto &s;urpa&s;&s;ed us in printed calumny and detraction.</P>
<P>From the&s;e my &s;entiments re&s;pecting the printers of defamatory papers, I hope, Sir, you will not que&s;tion my di&s;approbation both of the original authors, and the &s;econdary propagators, of &s;lander. But neither Mr. Boudinot's appointment to, nor depo&s;ition from, his of|fice, as commi&s;&s;ary of our &s;tate pri&s;oners, being in my department, it is not in my power to do you the ju&s;tice
<PB N="183" REF="024456_0190_0FC771A36B2453A8">
which you &s;eem to expect in that line; nor is there any authority in this &s;tate by which he can be-ca&s;hiered, till the next meeting of our a&s;&s;embly, which &s;tands adjourn|ed to the 19th of May. But the law of the &s;tate is al|ways at every one's &s;ervice; and in the ca&s;e of libels, if we are to credit the Briti&s;h lawyers, &s;o peculiarly fa|vourable to the pro&s;ecutor, that the &s;candal is not the le&s;s penal for being true, than if it was utterly fal&s;e; which, I think, is giving a man as great a chance as can rea&s;onably be de&s;ired; and perhaps, if you thought pro|per to publi&s;h your letter to me on the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration, it would be as ample &s;atisfaction again&s;t Mr. Boudinot, as the nature of the offence requires; but that I entirely &s;ubmit to your better judgment. In a word, Sir, whenever it &s;hall be pointed out to me in what manner I can, with any propriety, interfere in the matter, either as governor of this &s;tate, or as a private gentleman, I &s;hall not he&s;itate a moment to do you all the ju&s;tice which I conceive you de&s;erve.

I mu&s;t, however, take the liberty to &s;ay, as a man detached from all parties and wholly devoted to what he thinks the true intere&s;ts of his country, that I &s;hould be extremely unhappy in having rea&s;on to believe what is frequently, and perhaps injuriou&s;ly, reported of you, that you endeavoured to le&s;&s;en the e&s;timation in which General Wa&s;hington is held by the mo&s;t virtuous citizens of America; and which e&s;timation, not, Sir, from a blind attachment to men of high rank, nor from any &s;elf-intere&s;ted motive what&s;oever, but from a full conviction of his great per&s;onal merit and public impor|tance, I deem it my duty to my country to u&s;e my utmo&s;t influence to &s;upport.</P>

<P>I AM di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to think that all your friendly letters and me&s;&s;ages to me have met with &s;uch ungrateful re|turns.

<P>Major Eu&s;tace informed me of your reply to Pre&s;ident Reed's publications. Our printers refu&s;ed to give it a place in their papers: it was be&s;t for <HI>you</HI> they did &s;o.

Poor Penn&s;ylvania has become the mo&s;t mi&s;era|ble &s;pot upon the &s;urface of the globe.

<P>Your being robbed of your hor&s;es is a common evil, and its falling harder on you than any other per&s;on is what I &s;hould have expected, from the di&s;po&s;ition of wretches always di&s;po&s;ed to heap coals on the head of the injured.

Before I came to England, I did not lay much &s;tre&s;s on tho&s;e parts of his conduct which the new&s;papers have &s;o worried; and I recollect your Maje&s;ty was of the &s;ame way of thinking, that there was nothing very mon&s;trous in his acceptance of a peerage, but that it might be im|prudent, and argued a &s;en&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of glory, to forfeit the name of Pitt for any title the king could be&s;tow. But &s;ince I am a little more behind the &s;cenes, and am made acquainted with &s;everal circum&s;tances previous, conco|mitant, and &s;ub&s;equent to this event, I am apt to agree with the majority of the better &s;ort, that this once noble mind is quite overthrown. Can it be reconciled to rea|&s;on, that the &s;ame man who had rendered his name &s;o illu&s;trious and &s;o tremendous to the greate&s;t part of the globe, &s;hould &s;plit upon ribbons and titles; that when he had arrived at a higher pinnacle of glory than ever citizen did &s;ince the days of Epaminondas, he &s;hould be captivated by &s;uch a bauble, even though it &s;hould be at|tended with no ill con&s;equences to the affairs of his coun|try? but when &s;uch terrible ones were vi&s;ible, it mu&s;t be con&s;trued downright madne&s;s. Mr. Pitt, &s;ay they, was the only man who had capacity, &s;pirit, and power to a&s;|&s;ert the honour and intere&s;t of the nation with foreign &s;tates, correct the abu&s;es, and &s;tem the torrent of cor|ruption
<PB N="188" REF="024456_0195_0FC771B22A355028">
at home. His power was not founded on va&s;t property or cabinet favour, but on his popularity. By &s;inking into a peerage, his popularity would vani&s;h of cour&s;e, and with it all power of rendering, at a mo&s;t cri|tical time, any farther &s;ervices to his country. If it is objected that it is po&s;&s;ible to accept a title and retain the integrity of the citizen, they allow it; but that, unfortu|nately, the bulk of the people will not be per&s;uaded of it; that a popular mini&s;ter mu&s;t, therefore, not only be &s;trictly virtuous, but, like Cae&s;ar's wife, his virtue mu&s;t not be &s;u&s;pected; that this per&s;ua&s;ion of the people, ri|diculous as it may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight, is founded on too much ju&s;tice; for they ob&s;erve, that from the time of Wentworth down to that of Pulteny, not one in&s;tance can be produced of a man's changing his &s;eat from the lower to the upper hou&s;e, without a thorough renunciati|on of all principles and public virtue; but whether this opinion is well or ill founded, as it is a prevalent one, this revolt, error, folly, or madne&s;s, of &s;uch a man has &s;ome direful effects; it taints with jealou&s;y all public affiance, e&s;tabli&s;hes a doubt, whether &s;uch a thing as pub|lic virtue can exi&s;t: in &s;hort, it makes the bulk of man|kind indifferent who are in, who are out, as they are al|mo&s;t per&s;uaded that all men are, or will prove, in the end, equally vain apo&s;tates to the common cau&s;e, either through intere&s;tedne&s;s, vanity, or madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Such are the arguments not only made u&s;e of by the majority of Mr. Pitt's once admirers, but they were &s;tart|ed to him by tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have the great|e&s;t weight with him. Lord Camden, in particular, con|cluding this re&s;olution to be a &s;hort &s;it of compliance, and that his friend would &s;oon &s;ee the danger of the mea&s;ure, delayed the &s;igning of the patent for two days. But his lord&s;hip was mi&s;taken, the di&s;order had taken deeper root than he imagined; no girl could &s;hew more impatience for a new toy, than this fir&s;t of men did, till the te&s;timony of his folly was &s;igned and &s;ealed to the whole world. Your Maje&s;ty will probably object, that though Mr. Pitt played the child in one article, it is no
<PB N="189" REF="024456_0196_0FC771B32FB3A798">
proof of the general failure of his under&s;tanding; that no man was ever ble&s;&s;ed with &s;o entire faculties, as not, on &s;ome particular occa&s;ion, and in &s;ome unlucky moment to betray weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>But this is not the ca&s;e with Pitt, the decay of his parts is not only indicated by the act it&s;elf, but confirm|ed by his conduct in public and private character: In public the doctrines he broaches are diametrically the rever&s;e of what he has, through the whole cour&s;e of his life, a&s;&s;erted: In private, he is totally metamorpho&s;ed; from the extreme of plainne&s;s and &s;implicity, he is all pa|rade, magnificence and o&s;tentation. But I might have &s;pa|red your Maje&s;ty this prolix detail, when in a few words, it would have &s;ufficed to have &s;aid, that he has fits of crying, &s;tarting, and every effect of hy&s;teric; it is affirm|ed, indeed, that ten years ago, he was in the very &s;ame condition, that therefore a po&s;&s;ibility of his recovering once more his nerves, and with them all his functions; but from the age of the man, the generality con&s;ider the piece as fini&s;hed; the hone&s;t and well wi&s;hers of their country lament over him, the corrupt and profligate &s;ing <HI>Te Deum,</HI> as the Devil probably did for the fall of man. Your Maje&s;ty a&s;ks who is to mount the &s;tage in his room? I am &s;o far from &s;eeing any man &s;o qualified in all points, as to fill his part in time of di&s;traction and confu&s;ion, that I know no &s;et of men who have a chance of being called to it, who will not, by ignorance, ob&s;tinacy, or ti|midity, throw things into ten times greater confu&s;ion than they are at pre&s;ent. My Lord Rockingham is in|deed an hone&s;t, worthy, and &s;pirited man, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the good opinion of the people in general, but the&s;e at|tributes will probably exclude him. The Thane, who is &s;till all powerful, will never admit of a man &s;o endowed. He requires a certain degree of &s;ub&s;erviency and com|plai&s;ance; in &s;hort, he requires a mini&s;ter of his own jobs and partialities, and not an admini&s;trator of the na|tional affairs. As to the re&s;t, who form what is called the oppo&s;ition, they are &s;o odious, or contemptible, that the favourite him&s;elf is preferable to them; &s;uch as

Grenville, Bedford, Newca&s;tle, and their a&s;&s;ociates. Tem|ple is one of the mo&s;t ridiculous order of coxcombs I ever heard of, he is eternally appealing to the public, forgetting that the public never con&s;idered him farther than they would an old pair of boots, which Mr. Pitt might, through a whim, have &s;et a value upon, which when he cho&s;e to throw a&s;ide, it mattered not if they were thrown into a lumber room or the fire. Nothing could make the American coloni&s;ts ca&s;t off their obedi|ence, or even re&s;pect to their mother country, but &s;ome attempt on the e&s;&s;ence of their liberty; &s;uch as undoubt|edly the &s;tamp act was, which, if it had remained un|repealed, and admitted as a precedent, they would have been &s;laves to all intents and purpo&s;es, as their whole property would lie at the mercy of the Crown's mini&s;ter and the mini&s;ter's mini&s;ters, the Hou&s;e of Commons, who would find no end to the nece&s;&s;ity of taxing the&s;e people, as every additional tax would furni&s;h the ma&s;ter with means of adding to their re&s;pective wages; but it would be impertinent in me to enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the propriety or impropriety, the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice, of this mea&s;ure, when it is &s;o fully and clearly treated in &s;ome tracts which are bound up together, and which I have ordered to be &s;ent to your Maje&s;ty. If the humours which this accur&s;ed attempt has rai&s;ed, are &s;uffered to &s;ub&s;ide, the inherent affection which the colonies have for the mother country, and cla&s;hings of intere&s;ts one among&s;t another, will throw every thing back into the old channel; which indeed is the ca&s;e already: but if another attack of the &s;ame nature &s;hould be made upon them, by a wicked blundering mini&s;ter, I will venture to prophecy, that this country will be &s;haken to its foun|dation in its wealth, credit, naval force, and interior po|pulation.</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR PRINCE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will do me great inju&s;tice if you attribute my &s;ilence for &s;o many months to a want of &s;en&s;e of your
<PB N="191" REF="024456_0198_0FC771BCAC099EE0">
exce&s;&s;ive goodne&s;s and friend&s;hip, or even to carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, which, con&s;idering the obligations I lie under to your highne&s;s, would be one and the &s;ame thing. The truth is, that I was unwilling to trouble you with a ful&s;ome letter of acknowledgments, as I hope you are no &s;tran|ger to my &s;entiments on the &s;ubject; but I thought a few lines which would give you a &s;ketch of the &s;tate of this country, of the parties, and of our pro&s;pect in rela|tion to foreign and inferior affairs, would be the only po&s;&s;ible method of making your Highne&s;s &s;ome return for the thou&s;and in&s;tances of friend&s;hip which I have received at your hands; but the mo&s;t rea&s;onable &s;chemes are frequently defeated: &s;o it fares with me; for, al|though I have been in London eight days, which in this political and communicative town is &s;ufficient, one &s;hould think, to make a man ma&s;ter of every thing nece&s;&s;ary to be known; but my evil &s;tars have di&s;appointed me, and your evil &s;tars have dictated to me, that, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;ignificancy of all I have to &s;ay, it would be a pret|ty trea&s;on to remain any longer &s;ilent. You mu&s;t there|fore accept the will for the deed; in a few po&s;ts I hope to be able to amu&s;e you better. The King and his mi|ni&s;ters are out of town, or more properly, I &s;hould have &s;aid the mini&s;ters and their King, for I do not find that the latter is any more a principal than when I left Eng|land. Lord Chatham is &s;uppo&s;ed to be ab&s;olute in all affairs which concern the &s;tate; Bute in his corner, re|tains influence to a &s;ufficient degree, for the provi&s;ion of his creatures and countrymen, in &s;ubordinate offices; he di&s;claims all concern with bu&s;ine&s;s; but this is like the re&s;t of his conduct, a mo&s;t impudent and ineffectual hy|pocri&s;y; for he is, as u&s;ual, not credited. A formida|ble oppo&s;ition is expected, but the conjectures on its &s;ucce&s;s are too vague to be attended to. Some men of weight and reputation are embarked in it; but the heads are too odious to the nation in general in my opinion, to carry their point. Such as Bedford, Sandwich, G. Gren|ville, and, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, your friend Mansfield. He lately drew upon him&s;elf the laugh of the Hou&s;e of Lords,
<PB N="192" REF="024456_0199_0FC76D1A7B2DBFF0">
making u&s;e of the word Liberty of the Subject; and expre&s;&s;ing great regard to it, it was called Satan preach|ing up &s;anctity. Conway is &s;till &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and much regarded as a man of ability and integrity. Lord Shelburne, the other &s;ecretary, has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the opinion of the world; he &s;peaks well, and is very di&s;tinct in of|fice. The Duke of Grafton is an ab&s;olute orator, and has a fair character. An Iri&s;hman, one Mr. Burke, is &s;prung up in the Hou&s;e of Commons, who has a&s;toni&s;h|ed every body with the power of his eloquence, his com|prehen&s;ive knowledge in all our exterior and internal politics and commercial intere&s;ts. He wants nothing but that &s;ort of dignity annexed to rank, and property in England, to make him the mo&s;t con&s;iderable man in the Lower Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>A di&s;pute with Portugal, on &s;ome commercial points, &s;eems at pre&s;ent chiefly to occupy the thoughts of the mini&s;try. It is thought, that an amba&s;&s;ador extraordi|nary, with an e&s;cort of ten &s;hips of war, which is the be&s;t <HI>ultima ratio,</HI> will be &s;ent to Li&s;bon. I have had &s;ome conver&s;ation with our mini&s;try on the affairs of Po|land; but as this letter goes by the common po&s;t, I can|not &s;end you the particulars. The character of his Ma|je&s;ty is high in their e&s;teem. I intreat your Highne&s;s to pre&s;ent my duty to him, to a&s;&s;ure him of my zeal, veneration, and love; in a few days, I &s;hall take the li|berty of writing to him, or to Mr. Ogroud&s;ki. I wait till I have had a conver&s;ation with the King. Could your Highne&s;s procure me a copy of his Maje&s;ty's pic|ture, either in miniature, or otherwi&s;e? I a&s;k for a copy, as I would not pre&s;ume to trouble him to &s;it. You would likewi&s;e make me very happy with your own. I was much plea&s;ed with an acquaintance with Lavi&s;a at the Hague. His warm attachment to our incomparable ma&s;|ter has much endeared him to me. We have &s;ome books publi&s;hed here, which I fancy you would be glad to have, particularly, the whole letters of Swift. They are the be&s;t hi&s;tory of the times, and read with great avidity. When the Baltic is open, I &s;hall &s;end to his Maje&s;ty a

<P>I have not heard from our friend Lind; I beg you will chide him for this abominable neglect. Wroughton too de&s;erves abu&s;e; I &s;hall write to him in a few po&s;ts. The rea&s;on of Lord Thanet's delay in regard to the hor&s;e, was delicacy. He could not find any he thought good enough; but in the &s;pring he will &s;end a couple, which will, in all re&s;pects, &s;uit his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>I entreat you, my dear prince, to pay my humble re&s;|pects to your father, mother, the prince, chancellor, and all your hou&s;e, to which I have &s;o great obligations, and for which I have a &s;incere love and honour, and that you will &s;teal a few moments to give me under your hand what I am already convinced of, that I po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome &s;hare of your love and friend&s;hip.</P>

<SALUTE>MR DEAR COLEMAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t undoubtedly think me a very extraordi|nary per&s;on, that, on a &s;lender acquaintance, I &s;hould have &s;addled you with the curation of my affairs, and af|terwards not think it worth my while to write you even a civil note, &s;uch as a common acquaintance, who had conferred no obligation, might have expected. The truth is, I have every day expected to be a&s;certained of my de&s;tiny, and then intended to have given you a circum|&s;tantial plan of my operations; but as this day is as re|mote, in all appearance, as ever, I &s;hould be guilty of a mon&s;trous neglect, in any farther delaying, to pay the tribute of friend&s;hip which I &s;o &s;en&s;ibly owe. Believe me, my dear Sir, that I mo&s;t &s;incerely love and honour you; and this love and honour is founded on &s;o &s;olid a
<PB N="194" REF="024456_0201_0FC76D1F0F8A6C90">
ba&s;is, that I have dared to neglect a form which would not be pardoned by a per&s;on who is not really an object of e&s;teem.</P>
<P>I have been in this place two months waiting for an opportunity to join the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and I am afraid I &s;hall be obliged to wait a month longer. The commu|nications are &s;o filled with the offals of the confederates, who are them&s;elves a banditti, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tir ten yards without an e&s;cort of Ru&s;&s;ians: the Engli&s;h are le&s;s &s;ecure than others, as they are e&s;teemed the arch|enemies of the holy faith. A French comedian was the other day near being hanged from the circum&s;tance of his wearing a <HI>bob wig,</HI> which, by the confederates, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the uniform of the Engli&s;h nation. I wi&s;h to God the three branches of our legi&s;lature would take it into their heads to travel through the woods of Poland in bob-wigs.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t opportunity that will offer will be the pre&s;ent amba&s;&s;ador, who, it is &s;aid, will now be &s;ucceeded in ten days; but this has been &s;o long &s;aid, that I begin to de&s;|pair of any opportunity at all; if none &s;hould offer, I have made a wi&s;e journey of it: I believe it would break my heart. I have an un&s;peakable curio&s;ity of &s;eeing this campaign, though, in fact, I believe it will be a ridicu|lous one; if not like that of Harlequin and Scapin, it will re&s;emble the battle of Wilks and Talbot. The Ru&s;&s;ians can gain nothing by beating their enemy, and the Turks are confoundedly afraid. I wi&s;h by practice, to make my&s;elf a &s;oldier for purpo&s;es hone&s;t, but which I &s;hall not mention. If I am defeated in my intention of join|ing the Ru&s;&s;ians, I think of pa&s;&s;ing through Hungary, and &s;pending the en&s;uing winter in the &s;outh of Italy, Sicily, or &s;ome of the i&s;lands in the Aegean &s;ea. As you are a &s;cholar I venture to talk this cant. As to England, I am re&s;olved not to &s;et my foot in it, till the virtue which I believe to exi&s;t in the body of the people can be put into motion. I have good rea&s;ons for it. My &s;pirits and temper were much affected by the mea&s;ures which I was witne&s;s of, mea&s;ures ab&s;olutely moderate, laudable and
<PB N="195" REF="024456_0202_0FC76D21A392EB18">
virtuous, in compari&s;on of what has been tran&s;acted &s;ince. To return &s;olemn thanks to the Crown for the manife&s;t|ly corrupt di&s;&s;ipation of its enormous revenues and im|pudent demand on the people: to repair this di&s;&s;ipation, to compleat their own ruin, is pu&s;hing fervility farther than the ra&s;cally &s;enate of Tiberias was guilty of. In this light it is con&s;idered by all tho&s;e I conver&s;e with, of every nation, even tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t idea of liber|ty. The Au&s;trians and Ru&s;&s;ians hoot at us. In fine, it is looked upon as the <HI>ultimatum</HI> of human ba&s;ene&s;s, a <HI>conp de grace</HI> to our freedom and national honour.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, it is being a plea&s;ant corre&s;pondent, giving you my comments on what pa&s;&s;es under your own eyes, and being entirely &s;ilent on the tran&s;actions of this country, which you may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome cu|rio&s;ity of being acquainted with. You will not think me &s;erious when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I am as totally a &s;tran|ger to them as your&s;elf or any man in England. Hum|phrey Gates, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t know fifty times more of the matter. I &s;ee that the country is in one general &s;tate of confu&s;ion, filled with deva&s;tation and murder. I hear every day of the Ru&s;&s;ians beating the Confederates; but as to what the Ru&s;&s;ians, what the Confederates, what the body of the nation propo&s;e, I am utterly ignorant, though no move, I believe, than they are them&s;elves. The method of carrying on the war is equally gentle with what our's was in North-America; the Confede|rates hang up all the Ru&s;&s;ians who fall into their hands, and the Ru&s;&s;ians put to the &s;word the Confederates. The Ru&s;&s;ian Co&s;&s;acks have an admirable <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> in the&s;e executions. The other day, at a place called Rava, for|ty or fifty Confederates were condemned to the bayonet; but as they were tolerably dre&s;&s;ed, they were obliged to &s;trip for the ceremony, the Co&s;&s;acks chu&s;ing not to make any holes in their cloaths. The &s;ituation of the K&mdash; is really to be lamented, notwith&s;tanding he wears a crown. He is an hone&s;t, virtuous man, and a friend to the right of mankind. I wi&s;h he could per&s;uade a prince of my acquaintance, who is taught (as far as he can be

<SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD write to you with more ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, had you not given me to under&s;tand that you looked up|on me as an able letter-writer. The ambition of coming,
<PB N="197" REF="024456_0204_0FC76D25B08A77C8">
up to your expectations lays me under a con&s;traint which will inevitably make me fall &s;hort of every corre&s;pondent. To render my&s;elf tolerable, I mu&s;t endeavour to forget your &s;ex, your beauty; but, above all, the high opinion which you are plea&s;ed to conceive of my talents in this article. That I may not run into compliment, that I may dive&s;t my&s;elf of awe and vanity: the fir&s;t you would de&s;pi&s;e as ful&s;ome, and the &s;econd and la&s;t would be productive of re&s;erve and petulance.</P>
<P>Your under&s;tanding and the care you have taken to cultivate it, cuts me off from &s;ome of the mo&s;t fruitful &s;ubjects to female corre&s;pondents; the dre&s;s, intrigues, and diver&s;ions of the women in the &s;everal places we pa&s;s through: but, on the other hand, it affords me ample liberty of pouring out my mind upon &s;ubjects which, unfortunately for my own ea&s;e, engro&s;s it entirely; the dreadful &s;ituation of all the hone&s;t part of mankind, and particularly of our own country.

Europe is a&s;toni&s;hed at the rapidity of the change; high and low, men of every order, from the mini&s;ters of &s;tate to the political barbers, make it the &s;ubject of their admiration.

<P>This country is the rever&s;e of ours; they have an ho|ne&s;t, patriot k&mdash;g, but a vicious nation.

I &s;hall re&s;erve them for &s;ome future letter, or our evenings chat in Queen Anne Street, or Langham.</P>
<P>Our &s;tation here, I mean tho&s;e who are about the king's per&s;on, is whim&s;ical enough. We have few troops, the bulk of the&s;e totally di&s;affected, and the town is full of (though not declared, far from being concealed) Con|federates. We have frequent alarms, and the plea&s;ure of &s;leeping every night with our pi&s;tolson our pillows. I at pre&s;ent only wait for an opportunity to join the Ru&s;&s;ian army: this does not offer every day, as a &s;trong e&s;cort is nece&s;&s;ary, the communications being filled with bandit|ties of robbers, who are the offals of the Confederates. I believe it will be but a ridiculous campaign, &s;omething like that of Wilks and Talbot. The Ru&s;&s;ians can gain nothing by beating their enemy, and the Turks are con|foundedly afraid.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR LOUISA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN you fir&s;t reque&s;ted me to give you le&s;&s;ons in Engli&s;h, I e&s;teemed my&s;elf happy to demon&s;trate my gra|titude to Madam Kreithin for her &s;ingular kindne&s;s to me. I have been &s;o u&s;ed to conver&s;e with my&s;elf and a few favourite books, that I never found it nece&s;&s;ary to attend the toilets of women, merely as the generality do, to fly from them&s;elves, and kill the time which they have no other means of employing. This was my original motive; but on one or two conver&s;ations with my &s;cho|lar I entertained a &s;ort of ambition of adding &s;omething to the means of enlightening &s;o excellent an under&s;tand|ing as I perceived her to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. A little know|ledge of the Engli&s;h language I conceived to be one of the means, as it abounds with &s;o many excellent and in|&s;tructing books. For a few days my views were confi|ned to this; but, O Loui&s;a! you ought, you mu&s;t, have &s;een this ambition giving place to another le&s;s tranquil &s;entiment. Why did not you check it in its birth, by affecting to find difficulties in the ta&s;k you had under|taken? Why did you not, on &s;ome &s;uch humane pre|text, remove me from your &s;ide before the flame had acquired &s;uch inextingui&s;hable fiercene&s;s? This you &s;hould in charity have done, as you was determined to treat me as an enemy the moment I declared I loved. Your re&s;entment at my pretending to more than com|mon friend&s;hip, is futile and vain, or, what is wor&s;e, hy|pocritical and deceitful. You know your own charms, your own power too well. You have proved them with an unhappy &s;ucce&s;s on &s;everal, not to be con&s;cious that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee you often, and to hear you voice, without being forced beyond the bounds of friend&s;hip. But, to &s;peak proudly, I do not &s;ee why the declaration of my pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould &s;o heniou&s;ly offend you. To in|&s;pire you with an equal pa&s;&s;ion for an object de&s;titute of any kind of charm, would be ridiculous pre&s;umption: and were I furni&s;hed with every charm that could capti|vate womankind, to entertain any hopes which might affect your happine&s;s or reputation would be the highe&s;t

<P>I WROTE a &s;ort of &s;crap of a note to you by the hands of Fawkner, and flattered my&s;elf that I &s;hould have found at this place a &s;crap in return.

I have been in this happy capital five weeks, waiting for an apportunity to join the Ru&s;&s;ian ar|my, which does not offer every day, for the communica|tions are filled by a &s;et of gentlemen who are called Con|federates, but why or wherefore they are plea&s;ed to &s;tyle them&s;elves Confederates, I cannot find out.

I have long been acquainted with your private virtues, and my opinion of your political virtues is now confirmed. I am only con|cerned at your having thoughts of quitting parliament.

You think, that as you are not a &s;peaker, at you have no turn for bu&s;ine&s;s, your attendance will little avail; that it can|not contribute to &s;tem the torrent of corruption and vil|lany which, at pre&s;ent, bears down every thing before it.

They argue &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly, and they breathe &s;o noble an ardor, that if there is the lea&s;t under|&s;tanding remaining in your i&s;land, and the lea&s;t virtue la|tent, the former mu&s;t be convinced, and the latter rou&s;ed to action.

A town con&s;i&s;ting of thirty thou&s;and people, perhaps of more ea&s;e and affluent cir|cum&s;tances than any other town of the world, reduced at one &s;troke to beggary and wretchedne&s;s; every indi|vidual of them deprived of the means of &s;upplying them|&s;elves with a mor&s;el of bread, but what is furni&s;hed to them by the precarious hand of charity; to &s;ee a whole people &s;truggling with the extreme of di&s;tre&s;s, not only magnanimou&s;ly, but cheerfully, rather than comply with the wi&s;hes of brutal tyrants, and thereby admit prece|dents injurious to mankind and po&s;terity, is, I &s;ay, a &s;train of virtue almo&s;t too bright for modern eyes to gaze at; and mu&s;t &s;ill every brea&s;t, not totally dead to &s;enti|ment and feeling, with rage, indignation, horror, and compa&s;&s;ion. But they went further; they made a for|mal offer to the Congre&s;s, to abandon their town, with their wives, children, aged, and infirm, throw them&s;elves on the charity of the inhabitants of the country, or build

huts in the woods and never revi&s;it their native walls, until re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their rights and liberties. Your Lord&s;hip will &s;ee the Congre&s;s's re|&s;olve on this head: The&s;e in&s;tances, I am &s;ure, render unnece&s;&s;ary any thing I could &s;ay to incite a man of your Grace's &s;tamp to exertions in their favour, or, more pro|perly, in favour and &s;upport of human virtue.

<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have had twenty different accounts of your ar|rival at Bo&s;ton, which have been regularly contradicted the next morning; but as I now find it certain that you are arrived, I &s;hall not delay a &s;ingle in&s;tant addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to you. It is a duty I owe to the friend&s;hip I have long and &s;incerely profe&s;&s;ed for you; a friend&s;hip to which you have the &s;tronge&s;t claims from the fir&s;t mo|ment of our acquaintance. There is no man from whom I have received &s;o many te&s;timonies of e&s;teem and affec|tion; there is no man who&s;e e&s;teem and affection could, in my opinion, have done my greater honour. I intreat and conjure you, therefore, my dear Sir, to impute the&s;e lines, not to a petulant itch of &s;cribbling, but to the mo&s;t unfeigned &s;olicitude for the future tranquillity of your mind, and for your reputation. I &s;incerely lament the infatuation of the times, when men of &s;uch a &s;tamp as Mr. Burgoyne and Mr. Howe can be &s;educed into &s;o im|pious and nefarious a &s;ervice by the artifice of a wicked and in&s;idious court and cabinent. You cannot but re|collect their manoeuvres in your own &s;elect committee,
<PB N="209" REF="024456_0216_0FC76D4A79E9AF00">
and the treatment your&s;elf as pre&s;ident received from the&s;e abandoned men. You cannot but recollect the black bu&s;ine&s;s of St. Vincents, by an oppo&s;ition to which you acquired the highe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;erved honour. I &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all not trouble you with my opinion of the right of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing America without her own con&s;ent, as I am afraid, from what I have &s;een of your &s;peeches, that you have already formed your creed on this article; but I will boldly affirm, had this right been e&s;tabli&s;hed by a thou|&s;and &s;tatutes, had America admitted it from time imme|morial, it would be the duty of every good Engli&s;hman to exert his utmo&s;t to dive&s;t parliament of this right, as it mu&s;t inevitably work the &s;ubver&s;ion of the whole em|pire. The malady under which the State labours, is in|di&s;putably derived from the inadequate repre&s;entation of the &s;ubject, and the va&s;t pecuniary influence of the crown.</P>
<P>To add to this pecuniary influence and incompetency of repre&s;entation, is to in&s;ure and precipitate our de&s;truc|tion. To wi&s;h any addition, can &s;carcely enter the heart of a citizen who has the lea&s;t &s;park of public virtue, and who is at the &s;ame time capable of &s;eeing con&s;equences the mo&s;t immediate. I appeal, Sir, to your own con|&s;cience, to your experience and knowledge of our court and parliament, and I reque&s;t you to lay your hand upon your heart, and then an&s;wer with your u&s;ual integrity and frankne&s;s, whether, on the &s;uppo&s;ition America &s;hould be abject enough to &s;ubmit to the terms impo&s;ed, you think a &s;ingle guinea rai&s;ed upon her would be applied to the purpo&s;e [as it is o&s;tentatiou&s;ly held out to deceive the people at home] of ea&s;ing the mother country? Or whether you are not convinced that the whole they could extract, would be applied &s;olely to keep up &s;till further the enormous fund for corruption which the Crown al|ready po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and of which a mo&s;t diabolical u&s;e is made. On the&s;e principles, I &s;ay, Sir, every good Eng|li&s;hman, ab&s;tracted of all regard for America, mu&s;t op|po&s;e her being taxed by the Briti&s;h parliament; for my own part, I am convinced that no argument (not totally
<PB N="210" REF="024456_0217_0FC76D4C6C86F4D0">
abhorrent from the &s;pirit of liberty, and the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution) can be produced in &s;upport of this right. But it would be impertinent to trouble you upon a &s;ubject which has been &s;o amply, and, in my opinion, &s;o fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. I find by a &s;peech given as yours in the pub|lic papers, that it was by the King's po&s;itive command you embarked in this &s;ervice. I am &s;omewhat plea&s;ed that it is not an office of your own &s;eeking, though, a the &s;ame time, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it is very alarming to every virtuous citizen, when he &s;ees men of &s;en&s;e and integrity (becau&s;e of a certain profe&s;&s;ion) lay it down as a rule implicitly to obey the mandates of a court, be they ever &s;o flagitious. It furni&s;hes, in my opinion, the be&s;t argument for the total reduction of the army. But I am running into a tedious e&s;&s;ay, whereas I ought to confine my&s;elf to the main de&s;ign and purpo&s;e of this letter, which is to guard you and your colleagues from tho&s;e prejudices which the &s;ame mi&s;creants, who have infatu|ated General Gage, and &s;till &s;urround him, will labour to in&s;til into you again&s;t a brave, loyal, and mo&s;t de&s;erv|ing people. The avenues of truth will be &s;hut up to you. I a&s;&s;ert, Sir, that even General Gage will deceive you, as he has deceived him&s;elf; I do not &s;ay he will do it de&s;ignedly; I do not think him capable: But his mind is &s;o totally poi&s;oned, and his under&s;tanding &s;o totally blinded by the &s;ociety of fools and knaves, that he no longer is capable of di&s;cerning facts as manife&s;t as noon|day &s;un. I a&s;&s;ert, Sir, that his letters to the mini&s;try, (at lea&s;t, &s;uch as the public have &s;een) are one continued ti&s;&s;ue of mi&s;repre&s;entation, inju&s;tice, and tortured infer|ences from mi&s;tated facts. I affirm, Sir, that he has ta|ken no pains to inform him&s;elf of the truth; that he has never conver&s;ed with a man who has had the courage or hone&s;ty to tell him the truth. I am apprehen&s;ive that you and your colleagues may fall into the &s;ame trap, and it is the apprehen&s;ion that you may be incon&s;iderately hurried by the vigour and activity you po&s;&s;e&s;s into mea|&s;ures which may be fatal to many innocent individuals, may hereafter wound your own feelings, and which can|not

po&s;&s;ibly &s;erve the cau&s;e of tho&s;e who &s;ent you, that has prompted me to addre&s;s the&s;e lines to you. I mo&s;t devoutly wi&s;h, that your indu&s;try, valour and military talents, may be re&s;erved for a more honourable and vir|tuous &s;ervice, again&s;t the natural enemies of your coun|try (to whom our Court are &s;o ba&s;ely complacent) and not be wa&s;ted in ineffectual attempts to reduce to the wretchede&s;t &s;tate of &s;ervitude, the mo&s;t meritorious part of your fellow &s;ubjects. I &s;ay, Sir, that any attempts to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e mu&s;t be ineffectual. You can|not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed. No man is better acquainted with the &s;tate of this continent than my&s;elf. I have ran thro' almo&s;t the whole colonies from the North to the South, and from the South to the North. I have conver&s;ed with all orders of men, from the fir&s;t e&s;tated gentlemen, to the lowe&s;t planter and farmers, and can a&s;&s;ure you that the &s;ame &s;pirit animates the whole. Not le&s;s than one hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and gentlemen, yeomen, and farmers, are now in arms, determined to pre&s;erve their liberties or peri&s;h. As to the idea that the Americans are defi|cient in courage, it is too ridiculous and glaringly fal&s;e to de&s;erve a &s;erious refutation. I never could conceive upon what this notion was founded. I &s;erved &s;everal campaigns in America the la&s;t war, and cannot recollect a &s;ingle in&s;tance of ill behaviour in the provincials, where the regulars acquitted them&s;elves well. Indeed we well remember &s;ome in&s;tances of the rever&s;e, parti|cularly where the late Colonel Grant (he who lately pledged him&s;elf for the general cowardice of America) ran away with a large body of his own regiment, and was &s;aved from de&s;truction, by the valour of a few Vir|ginians. Such prepo&s;terous arguments are only proper for the Rigbys and Sandwichs, from who&s;e mouths ne|ver i&s;&s;ued, and to who&s;e brea&s;t, truth and decency are utter &s;trangers. You will much oblige me in communi|cating this letter to General Howe, to whom I could wi&s;h it &s;hould be con&s;idered in &s;ome mea&s;ure addre&s;&s;ed; as well as to your&s;elf. Mr. Howe is a man for whom I have ever had the highe&s;t love and reverence. I have
<PB N="212" REF="024456_0219_0FC76D514176B1E0">
honoured him for his own connections, but above all, for his admirable talents and good qualities. I have court|ed his acquaintance and friend&s;hip, not only as a plea|&s;ure, but as an ornament; I flattered my&s;elf that I had obtained it. Gracious God! is it po&s;&s;ible that Mr. Howe &s;hould be prevailed upon to accept &s;uch an office! that the brother of him, to who&s;e memory the much injured people of Bo&s;ton erected a monument, &s;hould be em|ployed as one of the in&s;truments of their de&s;truction! But the fa&s;hion of the times it &s;eems is &s;uch, as renders it impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould avoid it. The commands of our mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign, are to cancel all moral ob|ligations, to &s;anctify every action, even tho&s;e that the &s;atrap of an Ea&s;tern de&s;pot would &s;tart at. I &s;hall now beg leave to &s;ay a few words with re&s;pect to my&s;elf and the part I act. I was bred up from my infancy in the highe&s;t veneration for the liberties of mankind in general. What I have &s;een of Courts and princes, convinces me that power cannot be lodged in wor&s;e hands than in theirs; and of all courts I am per&s;uaded that ours is the mo&s;t corrupt and ho&s;tile to the rights of humanity. I am convinced, that a regular plan has been laid, indeed every act &s;ince the pre&s;ent acce&s;&s;ion evinces it, to aboli&s;h even the &s;hadow of liberty from among&s;t us. It was not the demolition of the tea, it was not any other particular act of the Bo&s;tonians, or of the other provinces, which con&s;tituted their crimes; but it is the noble &s;pirit of liber|ty, manife&s;tly pervading the whole continent, which has rendered them the objects of mini&s;terial and royal venge|ance. Had they been notoriou&s;ly of another di&s;po&s;ition, had they been <HI>homines ad &s;ervitudinem paratos,</HI> they might have made as free with the property of the Ea&s;t-India Company as the felonious North him&s;elf, with impunity. But the lords of St. James's and their mercenaries of St. Stephen's well know, that as long as the free &s;pirit of this great continent remains un&s;ubdued, the progre&s;s they can make in their &s;cheme of univer&s;al de&s;poti&s;m, will be but trifling. Hence it is, that they wage inexpiable war again&s;t America. In &s;hort, this is the la&s;t a&s;&s;ylum of per&s;ecuted
<PB N="213" REF="024456_0220_0FC76D5377B94DF8">
liberty. Here &s;hould the machinations and fury of her enemies prevail, that bright Godde&s;s mu&s;t fly off from the face of the earth, and leave not a trace behind. The&s;e, Sir, are my principles; this is my per&s;ua&s;ion, and con&s;equent|ly I am determined to act. I have now, Sir, only to en|treat, that whatever mea&s;ures you pur&s;ue, whether tho&s;e which your real friends (my&s;elf among&s;t them) would wi&s;h, or unfortunately tho&s;e which our accur&s;ed <HI>mi&s;rulers</HI> &s;hall dictate, you will &s;till believe me to be per&s;onally, with the greate&s;t &s;incerity and affection,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN we were la&s;t together in &s;ervice I &s;hould not have thought it within the vici&s;&s;itude of human affairs, that we &s;hould meet at any time, or in any &s;en&s;e as foes: the letter you have honoured me with, and my own feelings combine to prove we are far from being per&s;o|nally &s;uch.</P>
<P>I claim no merit from the attentions you &s;o kindly remember, but as they manife&s;t how much it was my pride to be known for your friend: Nor have I departed from the duties of that character, when I will not &s;cruple to &s;ay, it has been almo&s;t a general offence to maintain it: I mean &s;ince the violent part you have taken in the commotions of the colonies. It would exceed the limits and propriety of our pre&s;ent corre&s;pondence to argue at full, the great cau&s;e in which we are engaged. But, anx|ious to pre&s;erve a con&s;i&s;tent and ingenuous character, and jealous, I confe&s;s, of having the part I &s;u&s;tain imput|ed to &s;uch motives as you intimate, I will &s;tate to you as conci&s;ely as I can, the principles upon which, not volun|tarily, but mo&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly, I undertook it.</P>
<P>I have, like you, entertained from my infancy, a vene|ration for public liberty. I have likewi&s;e regarded the
<PB N="214" REF="024456_0221_0FC76D55B097B280">
Briti&s;h con&s;titution, as the be&s;t &s;afe-guard of that ble&s;&s;ing to be found in the hi&s;tory of mankind. The vital prin|ciple of the con&s;titution, in which it moves and has its being, is the &s;upremacy of the King in Parliament, a compound, indefinite, indefea&s;able power, co-eval with the origin of the empire, and co-exten&s;ive over all its parts: I am no &s;tranger to the doctrines of Mr. Locke and other of the be&s;t advocates for the rights of mankind, upon the compact always implied between the govern|ing and governed, and the right of re&s;i&s;tance in the latter, when the compact &s;hall be &s;o violated as to leave no other means of redre&s;s. I look with reverence almo&s;t amounting to idolatry, upon tho&s;e immortal men who adopted and applied &s;uch doctrine, during part of the reign of Charles the Fir&s;t, and that of James the Second. Should corruption pervade the three e&s;tates of the realm, &s;o as to prevent the great ends of their in&s;titution, and make the power ve&s;ted in them for the good of the whole people operate like an abu&s;e upon the prerogative of the Crown to general oppre&s;&s;ion, I am ready to ac|knowledge, that the &s;ame doctrine of re&s;i&s;tance applies as forceably again&s;t the abu&s;es of the collective body of power, as again&s;t tho&s;e of the Crown, or either of the component branches &s;eparately: &s;till always under&s;tood that no other means of redre&s;s can be obtained. A ca&s;e, I contend, much more difficult to &s;uppo&s;e when it relates to the whole, than when it relates to parts. But in all ca&s;es that have exi&s;ted, or can be conceived, I hold, that re&s;i&s;tance, to be ju&s;tifiable, mu&s;t be directed again&s;t the u&s;urpation or undue exerci&s;e of power, and that it is mo&s;t criminal, when directed again&s;t any power it&s;elf in|herent in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And here you will di&s;cern immediately why I drew a line in the allu&s;ion I made above to the reign of Charles the Fir&s;t. Towards the clo&s;e of it the true principle of re&s;i&s;tance was changed, and a new &s;y&s;tem of government projected accordingly. The patriots, previous to the long parliament, and during great part of it, as well as the glorious Revolutioni&s;ts of 1681, re&s;i&s;ted to vindicate
<PB N="215" REF="024456_0222_0FC76D5A357DB9C0">
and re&s;tore the con&s;titution; the republicans re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, to &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t it.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, lay your hand upon your heart, as you have enjoined me to do on mine, and tell me, to which of the&s;e purpo&s;es do the proceedings of America tend? Is it the weight of taxes impo&s;ed and the po&s;&s;ibility of re|lief after due repre&s;entation of her burthens, that has in|duced her to take up arms? Or is it a denial of the legi&s;lative right of Great Britain, to impo&s;e them, and con&s;equently a &s;truggle for total independency? For this idea of a power that can tax externally and not internally, and all the &s;ophi&s;try that attends it, though it may catch the weakne&s;s and prejudices of the multitude in a &s;peech or a pamphlet, is too prepo&s;terous to weigh &s;eriou&s;ly with a man of your under&s;tanding, and I am per&s;uaded you will admit the que&s;tion fairly put.</P>
<P>Is it then for a relief from taxes? or from the controul of parliament "in all ca&s;es what&s;oever," that we are in war? If, for the former, the quarrel is at an end. There is not a man of &s;en&s;e and information in America, who does not &s;ee it is in the power of the colonies to obtain a relinqui&s;hment of the exerci&s;e of taxation immediately and for ever. I boldly a&s;&s;ert it, becau&s;e &s;en&s;e and infor|mation mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ugge&s;t to every man, that it can never be the intere&s;t of Britain to make a &s;econd trial.</P>
<P>But if the other ground is taken, and it is intended to wre&s;t from Great Britain a link of that &s;ub&s;tantial, and, I hope, perpetual chain, by which the empire holds, think it not a mini&s;terial mandate; think it not a mere profe&s;&s;ion|al ardour; think it not prejudice again&s;t any part of our fellow &s;ubjects, that induces men of integrity, and among &s;uch you have done me the honour to cla&s;s me, to act with vigour. But be a&s;&s;ured it is conviction, that the whole of our political &s;y&s;tem depends upon pre&s;erving entire its great and e&s;&s;ential parts; and none is &s;o great and e&s;|&s;ential as the &s;upremacy of legi&s;lation. It is conviction, that as the king of England never appears in &s;o glorious a capacity as when he employs the executive power of the &s;tate to maintain the laws, &s;o, in the pre&s;ent exertions of
<PB N="216" REF="024456_0223_0FC76D5C73595708">
that power, his Maje&s;ty is particularly entitled to our zeal and grateful obedience, not only as &s;oldiers, but as citizens.</P>
<P>The&s;e principles, depend upon it, actuate the army and fleet throughout: and let me at the &s;ame time add, there are few, if any, gentlemen among us who would have drawn his &s;word in the cau&s;e of &s;lavery. But why do I confine my&s;elf to the fleet and army? I affirm, the &s;entiments I here touch, to be tho&s;e of the great bulk of the nation. I appeal even to tho&s;e trading towns which are &s;ufferers by the di&s;pute, and the city of London at the head of them, notwith&s;tanding the petitions and remon|&s;trances that the arts of parties and factions have extort|ed from &s;ome individuals; and la&s;t, becau&s;e, lea&s;t in your favour, I appeal to the majorities of the la&s;t year upon American que&s;tions in parliament. The mo&s;t licentious news-writer wants a&s;&s;urance to call the&s;e majorities mi|ni&s;terial; much le&s;s will you, when you impartially ex|amine the characters of which they were in a great de|gree compo&s;ed; men of the mo&s;t independent principles and fortunes, and many of them profe&s;&s;edly in oppo&s;ition in their general line of conduct.</P>
<P>Among other &s;upporters of Briti&s;h rights again&s;t Ame|rican claims, I will not &s;peak po&s;itively, but, I firmly be|lieve, I may name the men of who&s;e integrity and judg|ment you have the highe&s;t opinion, and who&s;e friend&s;hip is neare&s;t your heart; I mean Lord Thanet, from whom my aid de camp has a letter for you, with another from Sir C. Davers. I do not inclo&s;e them, becau&s;e the wri|ters [little imagining how difficult your conduct would render our intercour&s;e] de&s;ired they might be delivered into your hands.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, as well as to renew "the rights of our fellow&s;hip," I wi&s;h to &s;ee you; and, above all, I &s;hould think an interview happy if it induced &s;uch expla|nations as might tend, in their con&s;equences, to peace. I feel, in common with all around me, for the unhappy deluded bulk of this country: they fore&s;ee not the di&s;|tre&s;s that is impending. I know Great Britain is ready
<PB N="217" REF="024456_0224_0FC76D5DF07FB5E0">
to open her arms upon the fir&s;t rea&s;onable overtures of accommodation: I know &s;he is equally re&s;olute to main|tain her original right; and I al&s;o know, that if the war proceeds, your hundred and fifty thou&s;and men will be no match for her power. I put my honour to the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions as you have done to others; and I claim the credit I am willing to give.</P>
<P>The place I would propo&s;e for our meeting, is the hou&s;e on Bo&s;ton Neck, ju&s;t within our advanced &s;entries, called Brown's Hou&s;e; I will obtain authority to give you my parole of honour for your &s;ecure return. I &s;hall expect the &s;ame on your part, that no in&s;ult be offered me. If the propo&s;al is agreeable to you, name your day and hour;&mdash;and at all events, accept a &s;incere return of the a&s;&s;urances you honour me with, and believe me,</P>

<P>GENERAL LEE'S compliments to General Bur|goyne: would be extremely happy in the interview he &s;o kindly propo&s;ed; but as he perceives, that General Burgoye has already made up his mind on this great &s;ubject, and that it is impo&s;&s;ible that he (General Lee) &s;hould ever alter his opinion, he is apprehen&s;ive that the interview might create tho&s;e jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions &s;o natural to a people &s;truggling in the deare&s;t of all cau&s;es, that of their liberty, property, wives, children, and their future generations. He mu&s;t, therefore, defer the hap|pine&s;s of embracing a man whom he mo&s;t &s;incerely loves,

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I am ju&s;t informed you are ready to embark for England, I cannot refrain from once more tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on your patience. An opportunity is now pre&s;ented of im|mortalizing your&s;elf as the &s;avio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of your country. The whole Briti&s;h empire &s;tands tottering on the brink of ru|in, and you have it in your power to prevent the fatal cata&s;trophe; but it will admit of no delay. For Heaven's &s;ake avail your&s;elf of the precious moment: put an end to the delu&s;ion: exert the voice of a brave, virtuous ci|tizen; and tell the people at home, that they mu&s;t im|mediately re&s;cind all their impolitic, iniquitous, tyranni|cal, murderous acts; that they mu&s;t overturn the whole frantic &s;y&s;tem, or that they are undone. You a&s;k me, in your letter, if it is independence at which the Ameri|cans aim? I an&s;wer, no; the idea never entered a &s;ingle American's head, until the mo&s;t intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion forced it upon them. All they required was, to remain ma&s;ters of their own property, and be governed by the &s;ame equitable laws which they had enjoyed from the fir&s;t formation of the Colonies. The ties of connection which bound them to their parent country, were &s;o dear to them, that he who would have ventured to touch them, would have been con&s;idered as the mo&s;t impious of mor|tals; but the&s;e &s;acred ties, the &s;ame men, who have vi|olated or baffled the mo&s;t precious laws and rights of the people at home, di&s;&s;ipated, or refu&s;ed to account for their trea&s;ures, tarni&s;hed the glory, and annihilated the im|portance of the nation: the&s;e &s;acred ties, I &s;ay, &s;o dear to every American, Bute and his Tory admini&s;tration are now rending a&s;under.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="024456_0226_0FC76D64854DD578">You a&s;k, whether it is the weight of taxes of which they complain? I an&s;wer, no: It is the principle they combat, and they would be guilty in the eyes of God and men, of the pre&s;ent world, and all po&s;terity, did they not reject it; for if it were admitted, they would have nothing that they could call their own; they would be in a wor&s;e condition than the wretched &s;laves in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, who&s;e little peculium has ever been e&s;teem|ed inviolate. But, wherefore &s;hould I dwell on this? Is not the ca&s;e with Ireland the &s;ame with theirs? They are &s;ubordinate to the Briti&s;h empire; they are &s;ubordi|nate to the Parliament of Great Britain, but they tax them&s;elves. Why, as the ca&s;e is &s;imilar, do you not begin with them? But you know, Mr. Burgoyne, audacious as the mini&s;try are, they dare not attempt it. There is one part of your letter which, I confe&s;s, I do not under&s;tand. If I recollect right, [for I, unfortunately, have not the letter by me,] you &s;ay, that if the privilege of taxing them&s;elves is what the Americans claim, the conte&s;t is at an end. You &s;urely cannot allude to the propo&s;itions of North. It is impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould not think, with me and all mankind, that the&s;e propo&s;itions are no more or le&s;s than adding to a mo&s;t abominable oppre&s;&s;ion, a more abominable in&s;ult. But, to recur to the que&s;tion of Americans aiming at independence: Do any in&s;truc|tions of any one of the provinces to their repre&s;entatives, or delegates, furni&s;h the lea&s;t ground for this &s;u&s;picion? On the contrary, do they not all breathe the &s;tronge&s;t at|tachment and filial piety to their parent country? But if &s;he di&s;cards all the natural tenderne&s;s of a mother, and acts the part of a cruel &s;tep-dame, it mu&s;t naturally be expected that their affections will cea&s;e; the mini&s;try leave them no alternative, <HI>aut &s;erviri, aut alienari jubent;</HI> it is in human nature; it is a moral obligation to adopt the latter. But the fatal &s;eparation has not yet taken place, and your&s;elf, your &s;ingle &s;elf, my friend, may, perhaps, prevent it. Upon the mini&s;try, I am afraid, you can make no impre&s;&s;ion; for, to repeat a hackneyed quotation, 
<Q><PB N="220" REF="024456_0227_0FC76D65D6A26B18">
<L>They are in blood</L>
<L>Stepp'd in &s;o far, that, &s;hould they wade no more,</L>
<L>To return would be as tedious as go o'er.</L></Q></P>
<P>But, if you will at once break off all connections with the&s;e pernicious men; if you will wave all con&s;ideration, but the &s;alvation of your country, Great Britain may &s;tand as much indebted to General Burgoyne, as Rome was to her Camillus. Do not, I entreat you, my dear Sir, think this the mad rhap&s;ody of an enthu&s;ia&s;t, nor the cant of a factious de&s;igning man; for, in the&s;e colours, I am told, I am frequently painted. I &s;wear by all that's &s;acred, as I hope for comfort and honour in this world, and to avoid mi&s;ery in the next, that I mo&s;t earne&s;tly and devoutly love my native country; that I wi&s;h the &s;ame happy relation to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for ages betwixt her and her chil|dren, which has rai&s;ed the wide arch of her empire to &s;o &s;tupendous and enviable a height; but at the &s;ame time I avow, that if the parliament and people &s;hould be de|praved enough to &s;upport any longer the pre&s;ent mini|&s;try in their infernal &s;cheme, my zeal and reverence for the rights of humanity are &s;o much greater than my fondne&s;s for any particular &s;pot, even the place of my nativity, that, had I any influence in the councils of Ame|rica, I would advi&s;e not to he&s;itate a &s;ingle in&s;tant, but deci&s;ively to cut the Gordian knot, now be&s;meared with civil blood.</P>
<P>This, I know, is &s;trong emphatic language, and might pa&s;s, with men who are &s;trangers to the flame which the love of liberty is capable of lighting up in the human brea&s;t, for a proof of my in&s;anity; but you, Sir, unle&s;s I have mi&s;taken you from the beginning, will conceive, that a man in his &s;ober &s;en&s;es, may po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch feelings. In my &s;ober &s;en&s;es, therefore, permit me once more mo&s;t earne&s;tly to entreat and conjure you to exert your whole force, energy, and talents to &s;top the mini&s;try in this their headlong career. If you labour in vain (as, I mu&s;t repeat, I think will be the ca&s;e) addre&s;s your&s;elf to the people at large. By adopting this method, I am &s;o &s;anguine, as to a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf of your &s;ucce&s;s; and your
<PB N="221" REF="024456_0228_0FC76D67C4A1D250">
public character will be as illu&s;trious as your per&s;onal qualities are amiable to all who intimately know you. By your means the coloni&s;ts will long continue the farmers, planters, and &s;hipwrights of Great Britain; but if the pre&s;ent cour&s;e is per&s;i&s;ted in, an internal divorce mu&s;t inevitably take place. As to the idea of &s;ubduing them into &s;ervitude, and indemnifying your&s;elves for the ex|pence, you mu&s;t be convinced long before this of its ab|&s;urdity.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not, perhaps, be extravagant, if I advanced, that all the &s;hips of the world would be too few to tran&s;|port force &s;ufficient to conquer three millions of people, unanimou&s;ly determined to &s;acrifice every thing to liberty; but, if it were po&s;&s;ible, the victory would not be le&s;s ru|inous than the defeat. You would only de&s;troy your own &s;trength. No revenue can po&s;&s;ibly be exacted out of this country. The army of place-men might be en|crea&s;ed, but her circuitous commerce, founded on per|fect freedom, which alone can furni&s;h riches to the me|tropolis, would fall to the ground. But the dignity of Great Britain, it &s;eems, is at &s;take. Would you, Sir, if in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion you had &s;truck a &s;ingle drummer of your regiment, and afterwards di&s;covered that you had done it unju&s;tly, think it any forfeiture of your dig|nity to acknowledge the wrong? No: I am well acquaint|ed with your di&s;po&s;ition, you would a&s;k him pardon at the head of your regiment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude (if you will excu&s;e the pedantry) with a &s;entence of Latin: <HI>Ju&s;tum e&s;t bellum quibus nece&s;|&s;arium, et pia arma quibus nulla, ni&s;i in armis, relinquitur &s;pes.</HI> I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h you a quick and pro&s;perous voyage, and that your happine&s;s and glory may be equal to the idea I have of your merits, as,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter, lately &s;ent into Bo&s;ton, all political di&s;|qui&s;ition was de&s;ignedly avoided. I did not avail my&s;elf of the advantages which the &s;acred cau&s;e of my country, of liberty, and of human nature, manife&s;tly gave me over Mr. Gage. I remon&s;trated with you in decent terms, with re&s;pect to the hard and unworthy treatment &s;hewn, as I have been informed, to the &s;oldiers and citizens of America, whom the fortune of war, chance, or an er|roneous opinion of your honour, had thrown into your hands. In an&s;wer to this remon&s;trance, we are in&s;ulted with the mo&s;t outrageous language, and abu&s;ive epithets. Were we, Sir, the wor&s;t of traitors; had we con&s;pired to &s;ubvert the liberties of our fellow &s;ubjects; had we con&s;pired to re-e&s;tabli&s;h on the throne the expelled ty|rants of the Stuart hou&s;e; or, could we be charged with any notorious breach of faith; had we, for in&s;tance, &s;e|duced &s;ome part of the troops under your command, upon certain conditions, into a &s;urrender of their arms, and afterwards violated our engagement, the &s;tyle which you a&s;&s;ume would &s;carcely be ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>You affect, Sir, to de&s;pi&s;e all rank not derived from the &s;ame &s;ource with your own; to &s;peak, as I think, with becoming pride, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a more honourable &s;ource than that to which I owe my pre&s;ent &s;tation. I was called to it by the voice of the freely cho|&s;en delegates of a virtuous and uncorrupt people. Yours, for aught I know, and, as I am told, is frequently the ca&s;e, might have been obtained by connections with &s;ome pro&s;titute part of a pro&s;titute Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>You threaten us, Sir, with a cord: Begin, Sir; I dare you to it. Although my nature &s;hudders at the thought, nece&s;&s;ity will force us to retaliate; and we have it in our power, Mr. Gage, to make a ten-fold retaliation.</P>
<P>You have the confidence to appeal to that Almighty God who&s;e every law you have violated. Let that Al|mighty God, to whom the rights and happine&s;s of his creatures cannot be indifferent, judge then between us. When the great and tremendous day &s;hall arrive; when
<PB N="223" REF="024456_0230_0FC76D6E0E179AE0">
all mortals are to render a &s;trict account, which, do you apprehend, Sir, will have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to tremble? The virtuous citizen, now forced to arms by the hands of tyranny; in arms not to rob, &s;poil, and invade; not as mercenary in&s;truments to gratify the lu&s;t, ambition, avarice, or revenge of &s;ceptered robbers or wicked mi|ni&s;ters, but to defend their wives, children and hou&s;e|hold goods, and to deliver down to their po&s;terity the bright inheritance of freedom they received from their fore-fathers: which, I once more demand, &s;hall, on that dreadful day, have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to tremble? The citizens engaged in this righteous cau&s;e, or tho&s;e men, who by artifice, mi&s;repre&s;entation, and fal&s;ehood, have not only &s;tained this fair continent with the blood of her children, but &s;haken the mighty empire of Britain to her foundation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now, Sir, clo&s;e my corre&s;pondence with you, per|haps for ever, a&s;&s;uring you, that the intelligence you have received, with re&s;pect to the har&s;h treatment of the pri&s;on|ers in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is as remote from fact, as that which you have con&s;tantly tran&s;mitted to the mini&s;try, when &s;peaking of the principles and de&s;igns of America. Not only the officers and &s;oldiers have been treated with the tenderne&s;s due to fellow-citizens and brethren, but even tho&s;e execrable parricides, born among&s;t us, who have aimed their daggers at the vitals of their parent, have been protected from the fury of a mo&s;t ju&s;tly enraged people.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now, Sir, only add, that for the future, what|ever mode of conduct you &s;hall think proper to ob&s;erve towards tho&s;e of our people who are in your cu&s;tody, &s;uch exactly are the mini&s;teriali&s;ts to expect in return.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LITTLE thought the time could ever arrive when I &s;hould not run with eagerne&s;s to embrace Mr. Gage. Whether it is from a cynical di&s;po&s;ition, or a laudable mi&s;anthropy, whether it is to my credit or di&s;credit, I know not; but it is mo&s;t certain, that I have had a real affection for very few men; but that the&s;e few I have loved with warmth, zeal, and ardour. You, Sir, among&s;t the&s;e few, I &s;wear by all that is &s;acred, have ever held one of the foremo&s;t places. I re&s;pected your under&s;tand|ing, liked your manners, and perfectly adored the quali|ties of your heart. The&s;e, Sir, are my rea&s;ons, paradox|ical as they may appear to many, that I now avoid what I heretofore &s;hould have thought an happine&s;s. Were you per&s;onally indifferent to me, I &s;hould, perhaps, from curio&s;ity, appear in the circle of your levee; but I hold in &s;uch abhorrence the conduct, temper, and &s;pirit of our pre&s;ent court; more particularly their pre&s;ent dia|bolical mea&s;ures with re&s;pect to this country fills me with &s;o much horror and indignation, that I cannot bear to &s;ee a man, from whom my affections can never be weaned, in the capacity of one of their in&s;truments; as I am convinced that the court of Tiberius, or Philip the Second, were no more treacherous and ho&s;tile to the rights of mankind than the pre&s;ent court of Great Bri|tain. I cannot help thinking it one of the greate&s;t cur&s;es fallen on mankind, that they &s;hould be endued with &s;uf|ficient art to &s;educe or delude men of the be&s;t hearts and heads. My Lord Chatham him&s;elf was for a time their dupe; and poor York was entrapped for his de&s;truction. I believe, Sir, I know the tricks and in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s of the Cabinet better than you do. I have no doubt, but they were hard &s;et to work upon you. May God Almighty extricate you, with honour and &s;afety, from their clutch|es! I know not whether the people of America will be &s;ucce&s;sful in their &s;truggles for liberty; I think it mo&s;t probable they will, from what I have &s;een in my progre&s;s through the colonies. So noble a &s;pirit pervades all or|ders of men, from the fir&s;t e&s;tated gentlemen to the low|e&s;t
<PB N="225" REF="024456_0232_0FC76D7381EDBE70">
planters, that I think they mu&s;t be victorious. I mo&s;t devoutly wi&s;h they may; for if the machinations of their enemies prevail, the bright godde&s;s, Liberty, mu&s;t, like her &s;i&s;ter A&s;traea, utterly abandon the earth, and leave not a wreck behind. She has, by a damned con&s;piracy of kings and mini&s;ters, been totally driven from the other hemi&s;phere. Here is her la&s;t a&s;ylum; here I hope &s;he may fix her abode.</P>
<P>I have now, Sir, only to entreat, that as knaves and fools will probably, from de&s;ign and mi&s;under&s;tanding, exaggerate, disfigure, and di&s;tort what I do, and what I &s;ay, you will be upon your guard, particularly when it relates to your&s;elf. Though it is difficult to &s;eparate the man from the office, &s;hould it be reported that I ever &s;peak of you in terms of di&s;re&s;pect, I entreat, that you will &s;light the report. I am not capable of it. A per|&s;onal friend&s;hip for Mr. Gage has taken too deep root in my brea&s;t; though, were you my brother, twinned at a birth, I mu&s;t wi&s;h to defeat the purpo&s;es of tho&s;e by who&s;e in&s;tructions Governor Gage mu&s;t act.</P>
<P>As to North, my opinion of him is this, [and I have known him a long time] that did he hear of a &s;ingle free|man in the remote&s;t part of the world, he would willing|ly put his country to the expence of furni&s;hing forth an army and fleet for the &s;ole plea&s;ure of de&s;troying that &s;ingle freeman. I know, Sir, you will do me the ju&s;tice to believe that I am not acting a part; that no affectation has place in my conduct. You have known me long enough, I flatter my&s;elf, to be per&s;uaded, that zeal for the liberties of my country and the rights of mankind, has been my predominant pa&s;&s;ion. May God Almighty ble&s;s you, Sir, and, with honour to you, di&s;&s;olve the &s;pell which has charmed you into a &s;ituation &s;o incompatible with the excellence of your natural di&s;po&s;ition. Excu&s;e the length, and, if it appears to you, the impertinence, of this epi&s;tle, and believe me,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR PHIPPS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not for a long time read any performance with &s;o much plea&s;ure, as the paragraph in the public pa|pers announcing your &s;afe return. I congratulate your country, your friends, and particularly my&s;elf, on this happy event. As I mo&s;t &s;incerely love and honour you, I &s;hould have been plea&s;ed, in common with all mankind, had your hopes and expectations been an&s;wered in their full extent; but, as your individual friend, I am com|pletely &s;atisfied; for the attempt is &s;ufficient to immor|talize you. A young man of your rank and affluent cir|cum&s;tances, giving up his ea&s;e, plea&s;ure, and connections, to encounter mountains, and even to ri&s;k the taking up his re&s;idence in the thrilling regions of thick Ribbedia, for the public benefit, would have appeared heroic in any age or nation; but the inglorious in&s;ipid character of the pre&s;ent age heightens the lu&s;tre of the enterprize.</P>
<P>Once more, my dear Phipps, I congratulate you and all your friends on your &s;afe return; and the honour which is your due, and which is not paid you at home; come to this country, where your prai&s;es are &s;ung daily; but your political parliamentary conduct has the large&s;t &s;hare of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> panegyrick. Their opinion of your inte|grity, talents, and con&s;i&s;tency, is very high; and I hope you will believe that I do not labour to weaken it. By all that is &s;acred, the&s;e are a fine people, liberal, en|lightened, &s;en&s;ible and firm. Your Mansfields and Norths may play over their wretched tricks, have recour&s;e to their paltry fine&s;&s;es, may blu&s;ter and bellow, but they will never be able to trick or frighten the&s;e men out of their liberties. They are too acute and vigilant for the former to avail, and much too &s;trong for the latter. Twelve thou&s;and fre&s;h coloni&s;ts, half Germans, half Iri&s;h, were imported this year into Philadelphia alone, and not a much le&s;s number into the colonies of Virginia and New-York. The banks of Hud&s;on's-River, of the Mo|hawk, Su&s;quehannah, Juniatta, and the Ohio, from the Monongahela downwards thirty miles, which at the peace were totally a de&s;ert, are become one continued chain

of villages. Four large military town&s;hips are immedi|ately to be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi. I leave to judge, whether it will be ea&s;y to dragoon &s;o numerous a people for any length of time. Ships of war, it is true, may in|&s;ult, and put to inconvenience &s;ome of their capital ports; but the&s;e tea&s;ings and in&s;ults will only &s;erve to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of your mini&s;ter's policy in a more &s;triking light, by giving a unanimity to the&s;e people equal to their effectual &s;trength, when they may &s;et at defiance the machinations, not only of an earthly, but of the in|fernal petentate him&s;elf and his mini&s;try.

<P>This ble&s;&s;ed tea project meets with a re&s;i&s;tance full as vigorous, though more regular and temperate than the &s;tamp act.

<P>AS General Wa&s;hington has informed the Congre&s;s of his motives for detaching me, it is needle&s;s to trouble you upon the &s;ubject; I am therefore only to inform you, that I have collected a body of about twelve hundred men from the colony of Connecticut, who&s;e zeal and ardour, demon&s;trated on this occa&s;ion, cannot be &s;uffici|ently prai&s;ed.

I therefore

flatter my&s;elf that the Congre&s;s will receive, with indulg|ence and lenity, the opinion I &s;hall offer. The &s;cheme of di&s;arming &s;imply the Tories, &s;eems to me totally inef|fectual; it will only embitter their minds and add <HI>virus</HI> to their venom. They can, and will, always be &s;uppli|ed with fre&s;h arms by the enemy. That of &s;eizing the mo&s;t dangerous will, I apprehend, from the vaguene&s;s of the in&s;truction, be attended with &s;ome bad con&s;equen|ces, and can an&s;wer no good one. It opens &s;o wide a door for partiality and prejudice, to the different congre&s;|&s;es and committees on the continent, that much di&s;cord and animo&s;ity will probably en&s;ue, it being next to im|po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h who are, and who are not the mo&s;t dangerous. The plan of explaining to the&s;e deluded people the ju&s;tice and merits of the American cau&s;e, is certainly generous and humane; but, I am afraid, will be fruitle&s;s. They are &s;o rivetted in their opinions, that, I am per&s;uaded, &s;hould an angel de&s;cend from heaven with his golden trumpet, and ring in their ears, that their conduct was criminal, he would be di&s;regarded. I had lately my&s;elf an in&s;tance of their infatuation, which, if it is not impertinent, I will relate. I took the liberty, without any authority but the conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity, to admini&s;ter a very &s;trong oath to tho&s;e of Rhode-I&s;l|and, that they would take arms in defence of their coun|try if called upon by the voice of the Congre&s;s. To this Colonel Wanton, and others, flatly refu&s;ed their a&s;&s;ent; to take arms again&s;t their &s;evereign they &s;aid was too mon&s;trous. This is not a cri&s;is, when every thing is at &s;take, to be over complient to the timidity of the inha|bitants of any particular &s;pot. I have now under my command a very re&s;pectable force adequate to the pur|po&s;e of &s;ecuring the place, and purging all its environs of traitors, on which &s;ubject I &s;hall expect, with impati|ence, the determination of the Congre&s;s; their orders I hope to receive before or immediately on my arrival.</P>
<P>This in&s;tant the inclo&s;ed expre&s;s from the provincial Congre&s;s of New-York, was delivered into my hands; but as the&s;e gentlemen probably are not fully apprized of
<PB N="229" REF="024456_0236_0FC76D7F08524F60">
the danger hanging over their heads, as I have received intelligence from camp, that the fleet is &s;ailed, and that it is nece&s;&s;ary to urge my march, I &s;hall proceed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> divi&s;ion of the forces under my command to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity.

<P>I RECEIVED your commands on Sunday evening, and &s;hould have an&s;wered it immediately, but waited for the re&s;ult of an application I had made to Waterbury's and Ward's regiment, reque&s;ting them to remain here until they can be replaced by a certain number of troops from Philadelphia, and the Jer&s;ies. They have unani|mou&s;ly con&s;ented to &s;tay till the twenty-fifth of this month, which is a fortnight longer than the term they were enli&s;ted for. Before the expiration of this time, I am in hopes that &s;ome mea&s;ures will be taken by the
<PB N="230" REF="024456_0237_0FC76D8071DEF3D8">
Congre&s;s for throwing into the city, its environs, and Long-I&s;land, a force &s;ufficient to di&s;pute the ground with any number of troops we have rea&s;on to expect; not that I would imply that the&s;e two Connecticut regiments remaining here would be able to prevent the landing and lodging them&s;elves in the i&s;land, even five battalions of the enemy, &s;hould they choo&s;e to attempt it; but tho&s;e two regiments will enable us at lea&s;t to lay the foundation of the nece&s;&s;ary works. I have ordered a regiment from the Jer&s;ies, who will be here I hope in a few days. I &s;hall not, Sir, trouble you with a detail of our intended works, as I &s;hall have the power of paying my re&s;pects in per&s;on to the Congre&s;s in a very few days, for on Thur&s;day it is my intention to &s;et out. I am in very little pain about the execution of what we have concerted, as it is committed to the hands of Lord Sterling, who &s;hews much intelligence and activity. As this place will pro|bably be the &s;cene of a good deal of action, it would be prudent to add &s;omething to their pre&s;ent &s;tock of am|munition. I find by their returns, that there is in the whole colony, that &s;ent up to Fort-Con&s;titution included, five tons and an half.</P>
<P>The numerous body of profe&s;&s;ed Tories in Long and Staten-I&s;lands, with not a few within the walls of the city, is a mo&s;t alarming con&s;ideration; the mea&s;ures adopt|ed by the Provincial Congre&s;s, of obliging them to give bonds as a &s;ecurity for their good behaviour, can an&s;wer no purpo&s;e, but that of rendering them more bitter and violent. The fir&s;t regiment of our gracious &s;overeign's cutthroats which arrive here will indubitably cancel the&s;e bonds. I am well a&s;&s;ured, indeed, that the&s;e bonds are made a public joke of already, by the worthy gentlemen who gave them. In &s;hort, the friends to liberty are to a man convinced, that the Tories will take up arms, when encouraged by the appearance of any royal troops. The delicacy of our &s;ituation, the dangerous cri&s;is of affairs, have therefore determined me to take a deci&s;ive &s;tep, which alone, according to my judgment, can &s;ecure us: I have propo&s;ed to offer to the&s;e people a te&s;t, drawn

up in &s;uch terms, that refu&s;al or con&s;ent to take it, mu&s;t be a criterion by which we may be able to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;words are whetted to plunge into the vitals of their country, and who&s;e, if not drawn in defence of the common righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, may be expected to remain quietly in their &s;cabbards. The fir&s;t I have directed to be &s;eized without further ceremony and I &s;hould think my&s;elf highly criminal, in omitting &s;o &s;alutary a &s;tep before it is too late; perhaps I judge wrong; if I do, I mu&s;t my&s;elf take the &s;hame of being reputed weak, ra&s;h, and precipi|tate.

<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE nothing of &s;ufficient importance to trouble the Congre&s;s with; but &s;hall teaze you with a few words; I am exactly in the &s;ame &s;ituation I expected, puzzled where to go, or fix my&s;elf, from an uncertainty of the enemy's de&s;ign: I can therefore only act by &s;urmi&s;e; the general opinion is, that they will aim at this part of Virginia, viz. York and William&s;burgh, or that they will fix their head quarters in North Carolina: it has been already a&s;&s;erted, that Mr. Clinton was landed with one thou&s;and five hundred men at Wilmington; a letter from Brigadier Howe, dated from Edenton, &s;ays, that it is be|lieved, but not a&s;certained. I wait for further intelligence; in the mean time, I &s;hall employ my&s;elf in rendering this place, and York, as inacce&s;&s;ible as po&s;&s;ible; for it is my own per&s;ua&s;ion, that they will endeavour to po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of the capital, not only as it is really a mo&s;t tempt|ing and advantageous po&s;t, from commanding two ri+vers,

and a mo&s;t abundant country; but it would give an air of &s;uperiority and dignity to their arms, which in this &s;lave country might be attended with important con&s;e|quences, by the impre&s;&s;ions it would make in the minds of the negroes. I wi&s;h we had a couple of good regi|ments more in South-Carolina, it would then be per|haps <HI>hors in&s;ult.</HI> The apathy of this province &s;eems to go <HI>pa&s;&s;ibus aequis,</HI> with that of &s;ome other provinces, not|with&s;tanding the per&s;ua&s;ion and a&s;&s;urances of all the of|ficers, that the Tories about Norfolk will mo&s;t certainly repair to the King's &s;tandard, and have propo&s;ed means of &s;ecuring them; they &s;ay, &s;uch means would be violent and cruel. In &s;hort, as your affairs pro&s;per, the timidity of the &s;enatorial part of the continent, great and &s;mall, grows and extends it&s;elf. By the eternal God, unle&s;s you declare your&s;elves independent, e&s;tabli&s;h a more certain and fixed legi&s;lature than that of a temporary cour|te&s;y of the people, you richly de&s;erve to be en&s;laved, and I think it far from impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be your lot; as without a more &s;y&s;tematical intercour&s;e with France and Holland, we cannot, we have not the means of carrying on the war.</P>

<P>THE &s;ubject of this letter appearing to me of exceed|ing importance, I have re&s;olved to di&s;patch an expre&s;s to inform you, that the Roebuck, a king's &s;hip of 44 guns, has for &s;ome time left the Capes of Virginia, and, as we hear, is now lying off the Bay of Delaware, with a de|&s;ign to intercept the continental fleet. At Norfolk remain the Liverpool, a 30 gun frigate; the Otter floop of 14 guns, and &s;ome tenders; together with a &s;hip, Lord
<PB N="233" REF="024456_0240_0FC76D8AEEE77628">
Dunmore on board, of little or no force; and a number of ve&s;&s;els belonging to the Tories, with valuable cargoes and prizes, amounting, by a rea&s;onable e&s;timate, to an hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. If Mr. Hopkins is at Cape-Fear, would it not be a good mea&s;ure to inform him, how &s;ure a prey the&s;e &s;hips at Norfolk, with their immen&s;e trea&s;ure of goods, arms, ammunition and other military &s;tores would be to him, were he to come into the Capes of Virginia? It is not probable our fleet can keep the &s;ea much longer, a number of Briti&s;h &s;hips of war being expected &s;oon on the American coa&s;t; this la&s;t mentioned &s;troke would then be a glorious con|clu&s;ion; and if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary afterwards to keep it a &s;afe harbour, by erecting a battery at the mouth of the river leading to Norfolk, the navy of Great Britain might be, from the nature of the navigation, prevented from getting up. I am extremely anxious to know the &s;tate of your province, and of the &s;tate, number, and quality of your troops; any a&s;&s;i&s;tance which can be af|forded you by this province, as far as depends on me, you may command.

<P>NOT only propriety and decency, but an earne&s;t de|&s;ire to act in concert with &s;o re&s;pectable a body as the Committee of &s;afety, enjoin me to lay before them my thoughts, on &s;ome mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for the defence and very being of the colony.</P>
<P>After having con&s;idered the number and quality of your troops, the &s;tate and condition of your arms, artil|lery, and ordinance apparatus, the weakne&s;s and di&s;ad|vantages you labour under from the numerous inter|&s;ecting rivers, the multitude of your &s;laves, &amp;c.

I &s;ay, Sir, after having con&s;i|dered your &s;trength and weakne&s;s, no circum&s;tance ap|pears to me &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly alarming as the di&s;po&s;ition and &s;ituation of the inhabitants of the lower counties, Nor|folk,

and Prince&s;s Ann; but that I might not re&s;t en|tirely on my own opinion, I have called together &s;ome of the field officers who are be&s;t acquainted with that di&s;trict, and they unanimou&s;ly agree, that it will be dif|ficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;ecure and pre&s;erve the pro|vince, unle&s;s the&s;e inhabitants, thus dangerou&s;ly di&s;po|&s;ed, are removed from the very &s;pot where they can do &s;uch infinite mi&s;chief.

<P>THE di&s;agreeable uncertainty I have been in, of the enemies' de&s;igns, from the circum&s;tance of their being
<PB N="236" REF="024456_0243_0FC76D950BEFE498">
able to fly in their &s;hips from one &s;pot to another, hath kept me at William&s;burgh. It is evident that their ori|ginal intention was again&s;t North-Carolina, but the ap|parently total overthrow of their whole &s;cheme by Colo|nel Ca&s;well's victory, makes it more probable that they will bend their cour&s;e to &s;ome other quarter; whether to this province, or South-Carolina, it is impo&s;&s;ible to divine. I am my&s;elf more inclined to think that this will be their object, as the numerous inter&s;ecting navigable waters pre&s;ent them &s;uch &s;uperior advantages; though, at the &s;ame time, I confe&s;s my&s;elf in great pain for South-Ca|rolina; the force in that province &s;eems alarmingly &s;mall. I wi&s;h I could afford to detach from hence at lea&s;t three battalions; but neither our numbers of men, the &s;tate and condition of our arms, nor the va&s;t extent of this province open to attack, will admit of the thought. If Penn&s;ylvania could &s;pare three or four battalions for the defence 'Virginia, Virginia or North-Carolina might detach the &s;ame number to South-Carolina; and as the army which was employed in the blockade of Bo&s;ton is now &s;et at liberty, I &s;hould imagine this force might be afforded us.</P>
<P>We are &s;o extremely deficient in arms, that I have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending an officer into the back parts of the country to purcha&s;e all the rifles he can pro|cure for the continental &s;ervice. The arrangement I have made of arming two companies of each battalion with &s;pears, will render mu&s;quets and bayonets le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and the ca&s;e I find in reconciling the men to the&s;e kind of arms, is a flattering &s;ymptom of their &s;pirit. The price of the&s;e rifles, I am told, will be five pounds each; but as the article of cartouches and bayonets will be &s;aved, upon the whole, they will not be more, if &s;o expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>The defence and &s;ecurity of the capital rivets, with their creeks, is an object of &s;o great importance, that I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to direct as great a number of half gallies as po&s;&s;ible, to be con&s;tructed with the utmo&s;t expedition; but as the carpenters and other artificers in
<PB N="237" REF="024456_0244_0FC76D963507DDE0">
this country are &s;o lazy a race of mortals, that it is in vain to expect any fruits from their labours, unle&s;s there is a coercive power over them, I thought it the &s;ure&s;t and &s;a|fe&s;t method to e&s;tabli&s;h two companies of carpenters on the &s;ame terms with tho&s;e in the Jer&s;ies; the mea|&s;ure is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and I flatter my&s;elf it will prove oeconomy.</P>
<P>The nature of the &s;ervice here is &s;uch, the force not being collected into one point, but &s;cattered in fragments, that a greater number of &s;ubordinate &s;taff officers are requi&s;ite than in the Northern and Ea&s;tern armies. I have therefore taken the liberty, till the plea&s;ure of the Con|gre&s;s is further known, to appoint a few who could not be di&s;pen&s;ed with: inclo&s;ed is a li&s;t of them.</P>
<P>The Committee of Safety, I find, Sir, had not apprized you of their having already rai&s;ed a company of artille|ry, and appointed officers. Captain Innes, who was pla|ced at the head of it, though he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf utter|ly ignorant of this particular branch, is a man of great zeal, capacity and merit; and as there is a vacant majo|rity in the ninth, or captain Flemming's regiment, I have ventured to appoint him to act in that &s;tation, in hopes that the Congre&s;s will confirm his commi&s;&s;ion. A body of hor&s;e is a <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI> in a country circum&s;tanced like this; I take the liberty of enclo&s;ing you an addre&s;s I publi&s;hed to the young gentlemen of this colony on the &s;ubject, and wi&s;h it may meet with your approbation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make Mon&s;ieur Arundel accountable for the &s;ixty dollars, but at the &s;ame time beg leave to &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of the Congre&s;s, whether the expences of his journey &s;hould not be allowed; they amount to thirty dollars: indeed the pay of the artillery officers and engineers is &s;o wretched, that I do not &s;ee any chance of procuring men fit for the &s;ervice on the terms; and if they are procured, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s the expences of their frequent journeys are paid; for they are obliged, from the nature of their bu&s;ine&s;s, to make more journeys than other officers, and not in corps, but

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE committee will, I hope, excu&s;e my not having ye&s;terday made a report to them (as I think it my duty) of every tran&s;action which is not merely military; but they were &s;o much employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Prin|ce&s;s Ann petition, that I thought it better not to enter on the &s;ubject. As I found that the inhabitants of Port&s;mouth had univer&s;ally taken the oath to Lord Dun|more, and as that town was, I believe, ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the great channel through which his Lord&s;hip received the mo&s;t exact and minute intelligence of all our motions and de&s;igns, I thought it incumbent on me, and agreea|ble to the &s;pirit of your in&s;tructions, to remove the peo|ple without exception; for even the women and chil|dren had learnt the art, and practi&s;ed with addre&s;s, the office of &s;pies. A con&s;iderable quantity of very valuable articles were found in the hou&s;es of Mrs. Sprowle, Good|rich, and Nuil Jamie&s;on, &s;uch as mola&s;&s;es, &s;alt, and other
<PB N="240" REF="024456_0247_0FC76DA02E000FE0">
things much wanted for the public. A li&s;t of the&s;e ar|ticles will be made out by the officer commanding the party, and laid before your board.</P>
<P>As the town of Port&s;mouth will afford &s;o convenient &s;helter and quarters, to refre&s;h the enemy, on a &s;uppo&s;i|tion that they make this part of the world their object, it would perhaps be politic to de&s;troy it totally; but the hou&s;es of &s;ome of the mo&s;t notorious traitors I thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to demoli&s;h, in hopes of inti|midating the neighbourhood from trifling any longer, and flying in the face of your ordinances; for it is incon|ceivable, unle&s;s I have been gro&s;sly mi&s;informed, into what barefaced, open intercour&s;e with the enemy they had been encouraged, by no examples having been made. Sprowle's, Goodrich's, Jamie&s;on's and Skeddan's hou&s;es were on this principle de&s;troyed; the la&s;t, Skeddan, now a pri&s;oner at Suffolk, accu&s;ed, and, I believe, con|victed, of having been on board Lord Dunmore's fleet, &s;ince his acquittal by the committee of Norfolk. As we had undoubted intelligence that the fleet and army of Lord Dunmore were amply and regularly &s;upplied with provi|&s;ions and refre&s;hments of every kind, from that tract of country, lying between the Southern and Ea&s;tern branch|es, as well as from Tanner's-Creek, notwith&s;tanding the po&s;itive ordinances levelled again&s;t this &s;pecies of trea|&s;on; and as from a habit of any &s;ort of action, be it ever &s;o heinous, he who commits it, infallibly, in the end, per&s;uades him&s;elf there is no crime in it at all: &s;o the&s;e worthies not only every day openly and con&s;tantly carri|ed on this dangerous commerce, but, it is &s;aid, ju&s;tified it in their conver&s;ation; it, therefore, Sir, in my opinion, as well as of the other officers, and the committee of gentlemen from Suffolk, became indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome vigorous &s;teps on the &s;pot, which might intimidate the whole knot of the&s;e mi&s;creants from their pernicious traffic.</P>
<P>A Mr. Hopkins, infamous for his principles and con|duct, and who has a &s;on, now a &s;oldier in Dunmore's army, was fortunately the fir&s;t man detected; he was
<PB N="241" REF="024456_0248_0FC76DA23814CFC0">
&s;eized in his return from the fleet. He prevaricated and perjured him&s;elf very hand&s;omely on the occa&s;ion; but at length the fact was proved, and he confe&s;&s;ed. The &s;entiments of the committee and other officers concur|ring with my own, we determined, after having &s;eized his furniture, to &s;et his hou&s;e on fire in his pre&s;ence: This &s;tep was not quite con&s;i&s;tent with the regular mode of proceeding: but there are occa&s;ions, when the nece&s;|&s;ity will excu&s;e deviations, and this I hope will appear to the committee to be one of tho&s;e occa&s;ions. I mu&s;t here, Gentlemen, beg leave to repeat my a&s;&s;urances, that if ever in my military capacity, I &s;hould fall into any mea|&s;ure, which is more properly within the province of the civil, it will entirely proceed from mi&s;take, or inadver|tency, never from de&s;ign; and upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;o far from being offended by the admonition, or even re|primand, of your committees, I &s;hall think my&s;elf obli|ged to them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND the part I have acted in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mr. Eden, has given great umbrage to the council of Mary|land; I take the liberty of enclo&s;ing a copy of my letter to that board on the occa&s;ion; as I hope it will appear to the Congre&s;s, a full explanation and ju&s;tification of my conduct, I &s;hall not trouble them any more on the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>Five tran&s;ports with troops are arrived at Cape-Fear; I &s;hall therefore &s;et out on Thur&s;day for Wilmington, by the way of Halifax. When we con&s;ider, Sir, the va&s;t extent of the vulnerable parts of this country; the numerous navigable inter&s;ecting waters, the multitude of
<PB N="242" REF="024456_0249_0FC76DA427640BA0">
&s;laves; that we have not more than five thou&s;and regu|lars &s;it for duty in the province; that of the&s;e five thou|&s;and not more than three are properly armed; that to arm them, defective as they are, the province has been drove to the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;arming the minute men; I &s;ay, Sir, that when the&s;e circum&s;tances are con&s;idered, I &s;hall appear, I hope, rea&s;onable, in entreating the Con|gre&s;s to &s;pare us, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome battalions, and of tho&s;e battalions which are be&s;t armed. If indeed our minute men were properly furni&s;hed with mu&s;kets and ammuni|tion; if our rivers were already &s;ecured in the manner I propo&s;e; I &s;hould think my&s;elf capable of baffling all their attempts with our pre&s;ent force; but &s;ituated as we are, my anxiety for the common &s;afety obliges me to &s;olicit a reinforcement. A letter from one of your mem|bers informs me, that five thou&s;and blankets, and five thou&s;and pair of &s;hoes, are on the road for the u&s;e of this army; they were much wanted; the number is, I believe, &s;ufficient. We are, as I ob&s;erved before, wretchedly in want of medicines, as well as of a direc|tor to our ho&s;pital. Doctor M'Clurg is a very able man, and univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, qualified for the office; the pay of the regimental &s;urgeons e&s;tabli&s;hed by Con|gre&s;s is &s;o low, that it is in this part of the world, where the common country practice of &s;urgery is &s;ingularly lucrative, impo&s;&s;ible to find capable men, who will ac|cept; but I am in hopes that the convention will make &s;uch additions out of the provincial pur&s;e, as to enable us to fill the commi&s;&s;ions with proper and competent per|&s;ons: Now I am on the &s;ubject of pay, Sir, I mu&s;t beg leave to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;iderably increa&s;ing that of the engineers. It is impo&s;&s;ible that men, qualified for this important office, &s;hould be prevailed upon to &s;erve on &s;uch mi&s;erable terms. You have no American en|gineers; they mu&s;t of cour&s;e be foreigners; and fo|reigners expect, in their language, <HI>de quoi manger,</HI> that is, &s;omething which will enable them to eat and drink. Twenty dollars per month will not enable them to eat and drink, and wear linen, or indeed any kind of cloaths;
<PB N="243" REF="024456_0250_0FC76DA62826EE40">
be&s;ides, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the&s;e gentlemen are obliged, by the nature of their duty, to make more jour|neys than any other officers; that hor&s;es mu&s;t be pur|cha&s;ed and fed; that the expences of travelling in the&s;e Southern provinces are very high; from the&s;e rea&s;ons, and many others, the pay of engineers ought to be, as it is in all other &s;ervices, greater than that of other officers. Upon the whole, Sir, I really do not think that they ought or can do with le&s;s than forty dollars per month, and rations at lea&s;t for their hor&s;es. On more moderate terms I am per&s;uaded you cannot procure men equal to the ta&s;k: as the corps is di&s;tinct, and not numerous, this nece&s;&s;ary addition of pay will be an expence beneath the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Colonel Richard Henry Lee informs me, that it was not the intention of the Congre&s;s that Captain Innes's company &s;hould be reduced, to make way for Arundel's; but they &s;hould both be e&s;tabli&s;hed. I think, Sir, it would be a u&s;ele&s;s expence. Captain Innes, who mu&s;t, I am &s;ure, be an excellent officer in any other department, pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ignorant of this branch; his officers were equally ignorant: Arundel has got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the company, and by his activity and knowledge will, I am per&s;uaded, make them fit for &s;ervice. Indeed to e&s;ta|bli&s;h an artillery company, captain, &s;ubalterns, and non|commi&s;&s;ioned officers, being entirely compo&s;ed of novi|ces, can an&s;wer no end or purpo&s;e. It is my opinion, therefore, Sir, that in&s;tead of the&s;e two companies pro|po&s;ed, that the addition of thirty or forty men to Cap|tain Arundel's, and two &s;ubaltern officers, will not only be better, but that it promi&s;es more advantage to the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As I am on the &s;ubject of Captain Arundel, I beg leave to remind the Congre&s;s of what I mentioned on the &s;ubject of his expences on the road: There is one circum&s;tance of which, Sir, I could wi&s;h to be a&s;certain|ed, it is the expence of the defence of the&s;e rivers, that is, the con&s;truction of row gallies, floating batteries, &amp;c. to be brought to the account of the continent or of the
<PB N="244" REF="024456_0251_0FC76DA77B42F1B8">
province? I wi&s;h to be informed on this head&punc; if it is at the expence of the latter, I &s;hall regularly propo&s;e to the Convention, or Committee of Safety, every &s;cheme which may be attended with expence before it is entered upon. If the quarter-ma&s;ter-general, or his deputies, when they di&s;patch any teams from Philadelphia with powder, or other nece&s;&s;aries, were to purcha&s;e the hor&s;es throughout, for the continental u&s;e, in&s;tead of hiring them, the &s;aving would be con&s;iderable; for in this country the hire is intolerably dear; &s;o great indeed, that I have ventured to order a number of teams to be purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received a vague return of the forces of North-Carolina; of their powder and cannon; it does not appear that they have effective regulars, properly armed, more than two thou&s;and; of powder than two ton and an half; and as to cannon, they are almo&s;t to|tally de&s;titute. As the enemy's advanced guard, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, is actually arrived, I mu&s;t, I can|not avoid detaching the &s;tronge&s;t battalion we have to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but, I own, I tremble at the &s;ame time at the thoughts of &s;tripping this province of any part of its inadequate force. I am puzzled how to direct my motions from the uncertainty of the enemies' plan, but not di&s;pirited, as I am confident that the Congre&s;s will afford me every relief in their power, and am not in the lea&s;t diffident of the courage and zeal of the men and officers. I have, as yet, heard nothing of Mr. Stabler the engineer; I ought, in fact, to have at lea&s;t half a dozen; for we have a variety of po&s;ts to throw up, and there is not a man or officer in the army that knows the difference between a <HI>chevaux de frieze</HI> and a cabbage-garden. I wi&s;h the Congre&s;s would indulge me with Mr. Smith, whom I know to be an able and active man.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I am obliged, by the arrival of the enemy, to re|pair to North-Carolina, and am not le&s;s prompted by my zeal and affection for this province, than obliged by my duty, to take every precaution for its &s;afety before my departure: on this principle I beg leave to lay before the Convention the following mea&s;ures, which I conceive to be nece&s;&s;ary:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. To devi&s;e &s;ome means for e&s;tabli&s;hing a corps of cavalry; without which, an army is &s;o extremely defec|tive in every part of the world, and in none more than in this, for rea&s;ons which it might be tedious to enumerate.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Without delay to order &s;ome able pilots of every river, to examine accurately the narrowe&s;t part of the channel of each river; what is the nature of the &s;hoals which form the&s;e channels; whether they are &s;olid, firm &s;and, gravel, or rock; what is the di&s;tance of the neare&s;t part of the channel from either &s;hore; what is the nature of the &s;hore; whether it is high or low; for I am &s;an|guine enough to hope, when the&s;e circum&s;tances are a&s;certained, the navigation of mo&s;t of the riv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s may be &s;hut up to the enemy, by means of batteries, either float|ing or fixed.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. As the&s;e purpo&s;es cannot be effected without a large body of carpenters, &s;miths, and artificers of every &s;ort, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome companies of them, &s;ubject to the military laws; for without a coercive power, it is diffi|cult in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> part of the world to prevail on them to work.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. As I under&s;tand there are prodigious &s;tocks of &s;heep and cattle on the i&s;lands near the ea&s;tern-&s;hore, and as my authority does not extend to whatever concerns property, that you will order immediately all this &s;tock to be tran&s;ported to the continent; and if this is imprac|ticable, to kill them, as otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t indi&s;putably fall into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. As the ea&s;tern counties are, from their great abundance of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, &s;o tempting ob|jects to the incur&s;ions of the enemy, and as I under&s;tand there will be no difficulty in procuring good men, I
<PB N="246" REF="024456_0253_0FC76DB070F518A8">
would humbly propo&s;e to the Convention, to augment Colonel Flemming's regiment to the &s;ame &s;trength of numbers with the other battalions.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now, Sir, beg leave to mention to the gentle|men of the convention, a very important matter of con|&s;ideration; no le&s;s than the pre&s;ervation of the lives of our &s;oldiers. The continental allowance to &s;urgeons and &s;urgeon's-mates of the regiments is &s;o mi&s;erably &s;mall, and, at the &s;ame time, the common country prac|tice of &s;urgeons is &s;o very lucrative in this province, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to find men qualified for the &s;tation who will accept; and as I cannot venture to propo&s;e, to the Continental Congre&s;s, the increa&s;e of the pay of the &s;urgeons of the whole army, merely becau&s;e this increa&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary in my divi&s;ion, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit it to the judg|ment of the Convention, whether &s;uch an addition, as to bring up the pay of the&s;e gentlemen to the original provincial ordinance, will not be money well and nece&s;|&s;arily expended.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hould have done my&s;elf the honour &s;ooner of infor|ming the Congre&s;s of the attack made by the enemy's &s;quadron on Sullivan's-I&s;land, and their repul&s;e; but conjectured, that by waiting a day or two, I might pro|bably be furni&s;hed with the means of &s;ending a more mi|nute, full and &s;atisfactory account. My conjecture was right; for ye&s;terday five &s;eamen made their e&s;cape, one of whom is a more intelligent fellow than is commonly found among&s;t men of his level. Inclo&s;ed is a copy of their narrative; &s;ome parts of it are, perhaps, too whim|&s;ical and trivial to merit the attention of Congre&s;s, but I think it my duty to pre&s;ent it as it is, without adding or curtailing a circum&s;tance. I think, Sir, I may venture to congratulate the Congre&s;s on the event; not only the abvantages mu&s;t be con&s;iderable, but the affair reflects no &s;mall credit on the American arms.</P>
<P>On Friday, about eleven o'clock, the Commodore, with his whole &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of two line of bat|tle-&s;hips and &s;ix frigates, the rates of which are marked in the inclo&s;ed narrative, anchored at le&s;s than half mu&s;|ket &s;hot from the fort; and commenced one of the mo&s;t furious and ince&s;&s;ant fires I ever &s;aw or heard. It was manife&s;tly their plan to land at the &s;ame time their whole regulars at the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, and, of cour&s;e, in|ve&s;t the fort by land and &s;ea. As the garri&s;on was com|po&s;ed entirely of raw troops, both men and officers; as I knew their ammunition was &s;hort; and as the bridge by which we could reinforce, or call off the troops from the i&s;land, was unfini&s;hed, you may ea&s;ily conceive my anxiety. It was &s;o great, that I was in &s;u&s;pence whether I &s;hould evacuate it or no. Fortunately, while I was in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, &s;ome ammunition arrived from the town, and my aid de camp, Mr. Byrd, returning from the i&s;land with a flattering report of the garri&s;on's &s;pirit, I determined to &s;upport it at all hazards. On this prin|ciple I thought it my duty to cro&s;s over to the i&s;land, to encourage the garri&s;on by my pre&s;ence; but I might have &s;aved my&s;elf that trouble; for I found, on my ar|rival,
<PB N="251" REF="024456_0258_0FC76DBBCD70B450">
they had no occa&s;ion for any &s;ort of encourage|ment: I found them determined and cool to the la&s;t de|gree: their behaviour would, in fact, have done honour to the olde&s;t troops. I beg leave, Sir, therefore, to re|commend, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to the Congre&s;s, the commanding officer, Colonel Moultrie, and his whole garri&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as brave &s;oldiers and exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent citizens; nor mu&s;t I omit, at the &s;ame time, mentioning Colonel Thomp&s;on, who, with the South-Carolina rangers and a detachment of the North-Carolina regulars, repul&s;ed the enemy in two &s;everal attempts to make a lodgment at the other extremity of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Our lo&s;s, con&s;idering the heat and duration of the fire, was incon&s;iderable: we had only ten men killed on the &s;pot and twenty-two wounded; &s;even of whom lo&s;t their limbs, but with their limbs they did not lo&s;e their &s;pirits; for they enthu&s;ia&s;tically encouraged their comrades never to abandon the &s;tandard of liberty and their country. This, I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, is not in the &s;tyle of Ga&s;co|nading romance, u&s;ual after every &s;ucce&s;sful action, but literally fact; I, with plea&s;ure, mention the circum&s;tance, as it augurs well to the cau&s;e of freedom. At eleven the fire cea&s;ed, having continued ju&s;t twelve hours without the lea&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion. What the enemy's intentions are now, it is impo&s;&s;ible to divine. I am inclined to think, they will, if they can repa&s;s the bar, bend their cour&s;e to Che&s;apeak or Hampton-Bay: perhaps &s;hame and rage may prompt their land forces to &s;ome attempt before their departure: on my part, I &s;hall &s;pare no pains to di&s;cover their intentions and baffle their &s;chemes.</P>
<P>As Georgia is a di&s;trict of the command with which you have honoured me, I thought it prudent to reque&s;t &s;ome of their members to a conference with the pre&s;ident of this province, and my&s;elf. They accepted the invita|tion, and gave us great &s;atisfaction from their intelli|gence and good &s;en&s;e. Inclo&s;ed is the &s;ub&s;tance of their deliberation.</P>
<P>The province is certainly of the la&s;t importance to the common cau&s;e, and the mode of protecting it, pointed

out by the&s;e gentlemen, is, in my opinion, in all its parts, wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary. They had conceived a notion that I had powers to augment their e&s;tabli&s;hment; I a&s;&s;ured them I had no &s;uch powers; but both Mr. Rutledge and my&s;elf gave it as our opinion, that any expences mani|fe&s;tly beyond their faculties which they might incur in the common cau&s;e, would be repaid by the Congre&s;s: and in this per&s;ua&s;ion we ventured to enco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rage them to augment their cavalry, without lo&s;s of time, and make the propo&s;ed pre&s;ent of cattle to the Indians. Indeed, Sir, without a &s;trong corps of cavalry, I do not &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible to protect the&s;e Southern colonies, and with one thou&s;and good cavalry, I think I could in&s;ure their protection. From the want of this &s;pecies of troops, Charle&s;ton and its dependencies had certainly been lo&s;t, if the enemy had acted with the vigor and expedition we had rea&s;on to expect; but a mo&s;t unaccountable langour and inertne&s;s on their parts have &s;aved us. If the &s;cheme I propo&s;ed in Virginia had been approved and adopted, it would have been not only a &s;ecurity but con&s;iderable oeconomy. The forage was to have been the only ex|pence. Now I am upon the &s;ubject, I cannot help men|tioning, that I have been informed that the project has been con&s;idered by &s;ome gentlemen, as a &s;ort of a pre|&s;umption in me, in arrogating &s;uch a power; but I fancy the affair was not properly under&s;tood: I &s;aw the imme|diate nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a corps. I knew they could be rai&s;ed immediately by the&s;e means, and at the &s;ame time I was given to under&s;tand, by &s;everal gentlemen of the Virginia convention, that &s;hould the Continental Con|gre&s;s di&s;approve of the expence (trifling as it was) there was little doubt of their convention defraying it; but, in fact, Sir, the mea&s;ure &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alva|tion of the provinces, and not a day was to be lo&s;t; which, I hope, will fully ju&s;tify my conduct: and I mu&s;t beg leave to repeat my a&s;&s;ertion, that without cavalry the&s;e provinces cannot ea&s;ily be defended.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h &s;ome means could be devi&s;ed of reducing Ea&s;t-Florida to an American province. Had I force &s;uffici|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">,

<P>I &s;hall now, Sir, conclude with expre&s;&s;ing the high &s;atisfaction I have received from the zeal, activity, and public &s;pirit of the gentlemen and inhabitants of this city and province, from the pre&s;ident and council, down to the lowe&s;t order of the people; and with a&s;&s;uring you, that I have not, in my military capacity, met with the lea&s;t ob&s;truction or difficulty; but that we have all work|ed in concert and harmony for the common good.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Rutledge will inform you by this expre&s;s, of the outrages committed by the Cherokees, which mu&s;t be con&s;trued as the commencement of a war. As it is now certain that a capital and favourite part of the plan laid down by our enemies, is to lay wa&s;te the provinces, burn the inhabitants, and mix men, women, and children in one common carnage, by the hands of the Indians; and
<PB N="254" REF="024456_0261_0FC76DC632819890">
as this part of the plan, though a piece of inhumanity, is certainly more big with mi&s;chievous con&s;equences than the re&s;t, it appears to me ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to cru&s;h the evil before it ari&s;es to any dangerous height. Indeed, if we avail our&s;elves of the event, it may prove a fortu|nate one. Perhaps we ought, in policy, to have wi&s;hed for it. We can now, with the greate&s;t ju&s;tice, &s;trike a blow which is nece&s;&s;ary to intimidate the numerous tribes of Indians from falling into the mea&s;ures of our enemies; and as the&s;e Cherokees are not e&s;teemed the mo&s;t formi|dable warriors, we can, probably, do it without much ri&s;que or lo&s;s. I think then, Sir, that without a mo|ment's delay, a body of your frontier rifle-men &s;hould be immediately furni&s;hed, and march into the country of the Overhill Cherokees, and make a &s;evere, la&s;ting and &s;alutary example of them. The Carolinians propo&s;e at the &s;ame time attacking their lower towns, and, with the co-operation of Virginia, entertain no doubt of &s;ucce&s;s. Clinton's army and Parker's &s;quadron are pretty much in the &s;ame &s;ituation as when I wrote la&s;t. They daily, indeed, make &s;ome alterations in the po&s;ition of their land troops from one i&s;land to another; perhaps for new air or water, of which, the de&s;erters &s;ay, they are in great want. They tell us likewi&s;e, that con&s;iderable &s;ickne&s;s prevails in the army, and greater di&s;contents from hard duty and bad diet. The &s;pirit of de&s;ertion begins to &s;hew it&s;elf; five &s;oldiers came over the&s;e two la&s;t nights, who a&s;&s;ure us, that were they not on an i&s;land, from which it is difficult to e&s;cape, two-thirds of their army would &s;oon be with us. I am my&s;elf inclined to believe them. Up|on the whole, when I con&s;ider the difficulties which the enemy's Generals have to encounter, the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of their troops, and the improving &s;pirit of ours, I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, that the game is in our hands.

<SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received yours, of the 28th of May, and did not think it po&s;&s;ible that any thing could come from your hand to give me &s;o di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations. You tell me a dark, my&s;terious &s;tory of a certain great Gene|ral, of whom prince Ferdinand has declared, <HI>&s;i l'on veut un officier,</HI> &amp;c. this great General in the clouds, will, it &s;eems, graciou&s;ly conde&s;cend to &s;erve America, on con|dition that Congre&s;s will give him a&s;&s;urances of &s;tepping over the heads of every officer but one, and this he &s;ub|mits to, only on con&s;ideration of the confidence due to an American. You a&s;k my opinion on this &s;ubject; but the palpable meaning of your letter is, to prepare me for a ce&s;&s;ion of my rank in favour of &s;ome impudent adventurer. Buckwith is the man, as you conjecture, from his known political principles and military abilities, which are &s;o tran&s;cendent, that I ought for the public in|tere&s;t to make a &s;econd &s;acrifice. I am not, I believe, na|turally proud; I do not think my&s;elf conceited of my talents; but to be put in competition, much more to be &s;purned a&s;ide, to make room for &s;o de&s;picable a charac|ter as Buckwith, a generally reputed coward, (and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;d &s;ycophant) I &s;ay, to be kicked out of my &s;tation for &s;uch a creature as this, would &s;well a man more humble than my&s;elf into a trumpeter of his own merits. Great God! is it come to this? I am not, it &s;eems, an American; but am I not (if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf) <HI>Americanior ip&s;is Americanis?</HI> Have I not, &s;uch has been my zeal for your cau&s;e, once already waved my military claims in deference to the whim and partiality of &s;ome of your members? Did I not con&s;ent to &s;erve under an old church-warden, of whom you had conceived a mo&s;t extravagant and ridiculous opinion? Your eyes were at length opened, and deacon Ward returned to his proper occupation; and would you now a &s;econd time&mdash;do you think it con&s;i&s;tent with decency, I may &s;ay, gratitude or common hone&s;ty, to load me a &s;econd time with a &s;imilar di&s;grace? Have I betrayed any ignorance in my profe&s;|&s;ion? Have I &s;hewn a de&s;iciency in courage? Am I

&s;lackened in my zeal or indu&s;try? What have I done to merit &s;uch an indignation? What part of my conduct can ju&s;tify your harbouring &s;uch an idea? Have not I &s;taked say fortune, life and reputation in your cau&s;e? Is there a &s;ervice in Europe, to &s;peak proudly, (your in|jurious propo&s;al forces me to it) is there a &s;ervice in Eu|rope, where, with &s;ome &s;mall reputation, and my pow|erful friends, I might not expect the &s;ame rank I now hold? Have I not made my&s;elf a voluntary &s;lave for the in&s;urances of American freedom? Have I, &s;leeping or waking, employed a &s;ingle thought, but for her welfare, glory or advantage? But enough of this&mdash;You a&s;k my opinion, and I will freely, explicitly, and conci&s;ely give it to you. If the Congre&s;s &s;upercede me, I will, I mu&s;t obey; but I hope, in common ju&s;tice, and for their own honour, that they will re-e&s;tabli&s;h me, at lea&s;t in part, in the ea&s;y fortune which I have forfeited, &s;o as to ena|ble me to retire from a &s;ervice to which I am no longer thought adequate. Before I conclude, let me once more repeat confidentially to you, that if Buckwith is the man, in who&s;e favour you meditate &s;o gro&s;s a piece of inju&s;tice, you will make a very bad bargain, as he is certainly, un|le&s;s fame belies him, neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage, abili|ties, or integrity.</P>
<P>In God's name, if a real genius, or acknowledged hero, favoured by Heaven with a more than common portion of etherial &s;pirit, &s;hould pre&s;ent him&s;elf, (a <HI>la Lippe,</HI> or <HI>Bragan&s;a)</HI> receive him with open arms, as an immediate pre&s;ent from God; inve&s;t him with the com|mand of the whole. No man loves, re&s;pects and rever|ences another more than I do General Wa&s;hington. I e&s;teem his virtues, private and public.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I USED to regret not being thrown into the world, in the glorious third or fourth century of the Romans, but I am now thoroughly reconciled to my lot. The reveries which have frequently for a while &s;erved to tic|kle my imagination (but which, when awakened from my trance, as con&s;tantly I con&s;idered as mere golden ca&s;tles built in the air) at length bid fair for being realiz|ed. We &s;hall now, mo&s;t probably, &s;ee a mighty empire e&s;tabli&s;hed of freemen, who&s;e honour, property, and military glories are not to be at the di&s;po&s;al of a &s;cepter|ed tyrant; nor their con&s;ciences to be fettered by a proud,
<PB N="258" REF="024456_0265_0FC76DD186EFDD18">
domineering hierarchy. Every faculty of the &s;oul will be now put in motion, no merit can lie latent; the high|e&s;t offices of the &s;tate, both civil and military, will now be obtained, without court favour, or the ra&s;cally talents of &s;ervility and ob&s;ervance, by which court favour, could alone be acquired. Sen&s;e, valour and indu&s;try will con|duct us to the goal: every &s;park of ability which every individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, will now be brought forth and form the common aggregate for the advantage and honour of the community. The operations of war will be directed by men qualified for war, and carried on with that en|ergy natural to a young people. True unartized know|ledge, un&s;ophi&s;ticated learning, &s;imple genuine eloquence and poetry will be carried on to the highe&s;t degree of perfection. This, to many, I am &s;en&s;ible, would appear rant, but to you, who, I think, have congenial feelings with my own, it needs no apology. However, I &s;hall now endeavour to deliver my&s;elf more like a man of this world.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t &s;incerely congratulate you on the noble conduct of your countrymen; and I congratulate your country on having citizens, de&s;erving of the high honour to which you are exalted; for the being elected to the fir&s;t ma|gi&s;tracy of a free people is certainly the pinnacle of hu|man glory; and am per&s;uaded that they could not have made a happier choice.</P>
<P>Will you excu&s;e me? but I am my&s;elf &s;o extremely democratical, that I think it a fault in your con&s;titution that the governor &s;hould be eligible for three years &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively. It appears to me that a government of three years may furni&s;h an opportunity of acquiring a very dangerous influence; but this is not the wor&s;t; Tacitus &s;ays, <HI>plura peccantur, dum demeremur, quam dum offendi|mus.</HI> A man who is fond of office, and has his eye upon re-election, will be courting favour and popularity, at the expence of his duty. He will give way to the popular humours of the day, let them be ever &s;o pernicious. In &s;hort his admini&s;tration will be relaxed in general, or partial to tho&s;e whom he conceives to have the greate&s;t
<PB N="259" REF="024456_0266_0FC76DD2F1449450">
intere&s;t: Whereas, were all hopes of re-election preclud|ed, till after the intervention of a certain number of years, he would endeavour to illu&s;trate the year of his government by a &s;trict, rigorous, and manly performance of his duty. The&s;e notions may, perhaps, be weak and fooli&s;h; but &s;uch as they are, I am &s;ure you will excu&s;e my uttering them.</P>
<P>There is a barbari&s;m crept in among us that extreme|ly &s;hocks me, I mean tho&s;e tin&s;el epithets, with which (I come in for my &s;hare) we are &s;o beplai&s;tered; <HI>His Ex|cellency,</HI> and <HI>His Honour;</HI> The <HI>Honourable Pre&s;ident</HI> of the <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> or the <HI>Honourable Convention.</HI> This ful|&s;ome, nau&s;eating cant may be well enough adopted to barbarous monarchies; or to gratify the adulterated pride of the <HI>magnifici in pompous ari&s;tocracies;</HI> but in a great, free, manly, equal commonwealth, it is quite abominable; for my own part, I would as lief they would put rats|bane in my mouth, as the <HI>Excellency</HI> with which I am daily crammed. How much more true dignity was there in the &s;implicity of addre&s;s among&s;t the Romans! Mar|cus Tullius Cicero, Decimo Bruto Imperatori, or Caio Marcello Con&s;uli, than to his Excellency Major General Noodle, or to the Honourable John Doodle. My ob|jections are perhaps trivial and whim&s;ical; but, for my &s;oul, I cannot help &s;tarting them. If, therefore, I &s;hould &s;ometimes addre&s;s a letter to you without the <HI>Excellency</HI> tacked, you mu&s;t not e&s;teem it a mark of per&s;onal or official di&s;re&s;pect, but the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>The di&s;content of the troops which you mentioned as ari&s;ing from the want of regular payment, might have been remedied by General Lewis; his warrant is undoubtedly &s;ufficient for the pay-ma&s;ter: however, I have written to that gentleman on this &s;ubject, and am in hopes that affairs for the future will be more &s;atisfactorily con|ducted.</P>
<P>An old rice-boat, which we converted the other day into a row-battery, has made a con&s;iderable prize; no le&s;s than a brig with a whole company of the royal high|land emigrants on board, con&s;i&s;ting of two officers and

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WISH I had been informed how I am to addre&s;s my&s;elf in writing to the Board of War; whether to the board in general, to the fir&s;t members on the li&s;t, or to the &s;ecretary. I have ventured on the la&s;t mode; if it is wrong, I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed and corrected. The irregularity and tardine&s;s of the po&s;t are now become a matter of my &s;erious concern; we never receive a letter from Philadelphia in le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even weeks; that from the members of the Board of War and Ordinance is only ju&s;t now arrived, though dated the twelfth of

June. I have been pre&s;&s;ed, Sir, by &s;everal members of the Convention of Virginia, to e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t for this di|&s;trict; but am apprehen&s;ive, that it might interfere with the continental po&s;t; however, the con&s;equences ari&s;ing from the irregularity of the po&s;t are &s;o very &s;erious, that all other con&s;iderations mu&s;t be waved: In the mean time, I am con&s;trained to the nece&s;&s;ity of putting the continent to the expence of an expre&s;s almo&s;t on every occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I am extremely rejoiced at the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Board of War; for the bu&s;ine&s;s of Congre&s;s was &s;o com|plex and heterogeneous, that it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould give the nece&s;&s;ary attention to the affairs of any one di&s;tinct department; their regulations with re&s;pect to returns, &amp;c. &s;hall be punctually ob&s;erved. I have or|dered General Arm&s;trong to collect the returns from the different corps, to dige&s;t them into one, and tran&s;mit them immediately to the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am my&s;elf bu&s;ied in arranging matters for an expedi|tion into Ea&s;t-Florida. It is much to be lamented, that the&s;e Southern colonies &s;uffered the whole of la&s;t winter to pa&s;s over their heads without preparing the means either of offence or defence. Not a &s;ingle row-galley or armed boat was furni&s;hed by Virginia, North, or South-Carolina; were we provided with a moderate fleet of the&s;e &s;ort of ve&s;&s;els, I think I could en&s;ure the reduction of Ea&s;t-Florida, an object, though not equal with Cana|da, is certainly of very great importance. Here the mea&s;ures of the Southern Indians are concerted and planned, their treaties negociated and concluded; here they receive their bribes, for their murderous operations, and from hence they are &s;upplied with all the means and in&s;truments of war: from hence they have lately made &s;ome alarming incur&s;ions into Georgia, carried off a con|&s;iderable number of negroes, and not le&s;s than two thou|&s;and head of cattle: they have likewi&s;e thrown up a po&s;t on the river St. Mary's, which, if &s;uffered to remain, may prove extremely trouble&s;ome to Georgia, by affording a ready a&s;ylum to negro de&s;erters.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="024456_0269_0FC76DDD774C6AF8">From the&s;e con&s;iderations, although I cannot think of laying &s;iege to Augu&s;tine, having neither boats, hor&s;es, waggons, nor any other means of conveying cannon, ammunition, or provi&s;ion for the purpo&s;e. I think it both a prudent and nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure to attempt break|ing up the whole province of Ea&s;t-Florida. It will be a &s;ecurity to Georgia, occa&s;ion infinite di&s;tre&s;s to the gar|ri&s;on of St. Augu&s;tine, but, above all, make a &s;alutary im|pre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the Creeks, who now are thought to &s;tand wavering. They profe&s;s a good di&s;po&s;ition to|wards the American cau&s;e; but if, by a &s;trong predatory expedition into the province of the enemy, we give an idea of our prowe&s;s and &s;uperior &s;trength, they will be riveted in our intere&s;t. If I was &s;ure Mr. Clinton and his army had &s;teered their cour&s;e to New-York, as the de&s;erters all agree, and a letter which was left in Long I&s;land confirms, [a copy of which is here enclo&s;ed] I &s;hould, as I have nothing immediately el&s;e to do in my di&s;trict, march in per&s;on with this party; but the bare po&s;&s;ibility of his being gone to Virginia will detain me. Every &s;hip of the enemy has now repa&s;&s;ed the bar. It appears by this &s;ame enclo&s;ed letter that they were more roughly handled than even the de&s;erters repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s I make no doubt have been informed of the incur&s;ions made, and the ravages committed by the upper and lower Cherokees; an expedition I under|&s;tand is furni&s;hed forth by Virginia, again&s;t the upper nations; another by this province again&s;t the lower; the &s;ucce&s;s or mi&s;carriage is of the la&s;t con&s;equence; I am therefore de&s;irous of forming a &s;econd line, or <HI>corps de re&s;erve,</HI> and detaching for this purpo&s;e, a regiment of re|gulars, but have not as yet been able to procure waggons &s;ufficient for two companies. It will be nece&s;&s;ary that Congre&s;s &s;hould make &s;ome regular e&s;tabli&s;hment for waggons, I &s;hould think one waggon at lea&s;t, if not two, &s;hould be purcha&s;ed and appointed to each company of the whole army, and regiments made re&s;pon&s;ible for theirs re&s;pectively. We &s;hould then be able to march when occa&s;ion requires expedition; at pre&s;ent it is &s;ome|times
<PB N="263" REF="024456_0270_0FC76DDF01206FD8">
as much impo&s;&s;ible to march an hundred miles, al|though the fate of a province depended upon it, as if the &s;oldiers wanted legs.</P>
<P>I hope the Congre&s;s and Board of War will excu&s;e my giving an opinion on a &s;ubject on which it has not been a&s;ked; but I conceive it to be my duty not to re|main &s;ilent on any affairs of &s;uch moment. I find, Sir, that repre&s;entations have been made, that many incon|veniencies would ari&s;e from putting the troops of this province on the continental e&s;tabli&s;hment. I can a&s;&s;ure the Congre&s;s, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to carry on the &s;ervice, if they remain on the colonial e&s;tabli&s;hment; the difference of the laws, the di&s;tinction of rank, occa&s;ion &s;o much confu&s;ion; and the ridiculous farce of Duke and no Duke, we are playing, (the officers not always com|prehending who is their proper commander, whether the pre&s;ident, or continental general) occa&s;ions very dan|gerous di&s;tractions; but there are other matters of more &s;erious con&s;ideration, of which I &s;hall not trouble you with a detail; nor do I find that the officers of this pro|vince object to a continental e&s;tabli&s;hment, on the con|trary, all tho&s;e I have conver&s;ed with, &s;eem de&s;irous of it. Upon the whole, I think it ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to the public &s;ervice, that the&s;e regiments &s;hould immediately be put on the &s;ame footing, and be governed by the &s;ame laws, with the re&s;t; nor am I &s;ingular in opinion: the two brigadiers, all the officers of every rank, and the greater part of the gentleman of the country concur with me.</P>
<P>Colonel Muhlenburg, of the eighth battalion of Vir|ginians, has been made very unea&s;y by &s;ome letters he has lately received with re&s;pect to the rank of his regi|ment, The&s;e letters intimate, that it was never the in|tention of the Congre&s;s to con&s;ider the &s;eventh, eighth, and ninth, battalions of the Virginians on the continen|tal e&s;tabli&s;hment until they were entirely complete. That his regiment never was entirely complete; and that, con&s;equently, after having &s;o long thought him&s;elf on the continental e&s;tabli&s;hment; and on this pre&s;umption
<PB N="264" REF="024456_0271_0FC76DE08F6BB548">
having marched five hundred miles from his own pro|vince, under the command of a continental general, he now, at lea&s;t, finds him&s;elf only a provincial officer.</P>
<P>I have ventured to a&s;&s;ure him and his officers, who are equally unea&s;y, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome mi&s;take in this affair; in fact, the hard&s;hip would be &s;o great, that I cannot believe their apprehen&s;ions are well founded. It was, if I remember right, notified in April, by the Com|mittee of Safety in Virginia, that they were then taken upon the continental e&s;tabli&s;hment; and, though in this I may be mi&s;taken, without the provi&s;o of their being complete.</P>
<P>It happened at this time, though not complete to a man, (for no regiment ever is complete to a man) that Muh|lenburg's regiment was not only the mo&s;t complete of the province, but, I believe, of the whole continent; it was not only the mo&s;t complete in numbers, but the be&s;t armed, cloathed and equipped in all re&s;pects for immedi|ate &s;ervice; I mu&s;t repeat, that I cannot conceive that it was ever the intention of Congre&s;s that the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment &s;hould be filled to a man; but that they &s;hould be competent to &s;ervice in or out of their province. In mo&s;t &s;ervices when new levies are rai&s;ed, one half of the pro|po&s;ed complement entitles them to e&s;tabli&s;hment. Muh|lenburg's regiment wanted only forty at mo&s;t. It was the &s;trength and good condition of the regiment, that in|duced me to order it out of its own province, in prefer|ence to any other. I certainly con&s;idered them at that time as continental troops, otherwi&s;e I could have no au|thority to order them out of the province.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of the Congre&s;s, if it would not really be the greate&s;t cruelty, that their &s;trength and good condition &s;hould be turned again&s;t them. It was their &s;trength and good condition which carried them out of their province, where, had they remained and known that it was a nece&s;&s;ary condi|tion of their e&s;tabli&s;hment to be complete to a man, they certainly could have accompli&s;hed it in three days. I do, therefore, mo&s;t &s;incerely hope, and confidently per&s;uade
<PB N="265" REF="024456_0272_0FC76DE790F60E68">
my&s;elf, that Muhlenburg's regiment will at lea&s;t data their rank from the day I ordered them to march out of their province; not only ju&s;tice, but policy requires it, for you will otherwi&s;e lo&s;e a mo&s;t excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">giment.</P>
<P>I often repre&s;ented to Congre&s;s how difficult or impo&s;|&s;ible it would be to engage, or retain after they were en|gaged, any engineers of tolerable qualification on the wretched pay e&s;tabli&s;hed. The two appointed to my di&s;trict have [as I expected] quitted the &s;ervice; it was indeed impo&s;&s;ible for them to exi&s;t. Stabler, I hear, has entered into the &s;ervice of Virginia. Ma&s;&s;enburg is re|tained by this province, at fifty-four dollars per month, a &s;ervant, rations, and his travelling expences. He for|merly begged his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from me, a&s;&s;uring me (and, I believe, &s;incerely) he was zealous in the cau&s;e of Ame|rica; that he would willingly, if I cho&s;e it, enli&s;t as a common &s;oldier; but that to ride about the continent from north to &s;outh, find hor&s;es, and appear like a gen|tleman was impo&s;&s;ible. I could not in con&s;cience force him to &s;tarve, &s;o con&s;ented to his engaging in this &s;ervice. I am now without a &s;ingle engineer, and really know not how to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s. I hope the board will con|&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upplying me.</P>

<P>ANY irregularity of returns of the forces under my command, will not, I hope, be imputed to me; the ex|ten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uperintending the &s;afety of &s;o va&s;t a territory, as that which the Congre&s;s have committed to my charge, renders it impo&s;&s;ible for me to attend to the detail of the regiments, or, in any rea&s;onable time, to col|lect and dige&s;t the various returns; but I have given or|ders to the brigadiers to be as accurate as po&s;&s;ible on this &s;ubject in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, and have no rea|&s;on, from my knowledge of the men, to think they will be deficient. As a thorough knowledge of the pre&s;ent condition of this colony, of its &s;trength and weakne&s;s, is certainly a matter of very &s;erious con&s;ideration, I &s;hall lay before the Board the be&s;t and mo&s;t accurate information I am able.</P>
<P>Georgia is a &s;tate of much greater importance to the empire of America than generally &s;uppo&s;ed, at lea&s;t, than what I my&s;elf imagined before I vi&s;ited it. The variety
<PB N="267" REF="024456_0274_0FC76DEA5F3C0860">
of navigable rivers, commodious harbours, and find in|lets; the prodigious quantities of rice, and immen&s;e &s;tocks of cattle, both on the i&s;lands, and on the main; but above all the gentlene&s;s and &s;alubrity of the winter &s;ea&s;ons, with the conveniency of its &s;ituation for com|merce with the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, would render it a mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the enemy; the Altamaha, a very noble river, already furni&s;hes a con&s;iderable quan|tity, and may, in time, furni&s;h any quantity of lum|ber; the garri&s;on of St. Augu&s;tine, and, indeed, the whole province of Ea&s;t-Florida, draw their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from Georgia; and, if all intercour&s;e with her were cut off, that ne&s;t of robbers and pirates would probably fall to the ground, and of cour&s;e, the empire of the United States become more round and entire. The&s;e circum|&s;tances &s;ummed up together, mu&s;t evince the importance of keeping Georgia or any part of it out of the hands of the enemy; the means of doing it, demands the utmo&s;t attention. I have turned my thoughts to the &s;ubject, and &s;hall beg leave to &s;ubmit the re&s;ult to the con&s;idera|tion of the Congre&s;s. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the &s;trength of this colony, con&s;i&s;ts of Colonel M'Into&s;h's ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lion, a return of which, is here enclo&s;ed, a company of indepen|dent artillery, con&s;i&s;ting of three officers and twenty-three privates, with about twenty-five hundred militia of all &s;orts; but in a very great part of the&s;e (as I learn from the authority of their own captains) very little confi|dence can be placed, their principles being extremely contaminated by a mo&s;t pernicious banditti of enemies to the common liberty. M'Into&s;h's battalion is really a very fine one, (one of the be&s;t, I think, on the conti|nent) but as, perhaps, it might appear a har&s;h ta&s;k, to in&s;i&s;t on this battalion's acting with the nece&s;&s;ary rigour again&s;t &s;ome of their neare&s;t connections and relations, accu&s;ed of being concerned in trea&s;onable practices; it is my intention to remove them either into South or North-Carolina, where they can be more &s;erviceable, and have an opportunity of compleating them&s;elves, which in this &s;tate, from the dearth of men, is impo&s;&s;ible, and
<PB N="268" REF="024456_0275_0FC76DEF760AB780">
replace them with an equal or greater number from South-Carolina.</P>
<P>Such is the pre&s;ent condition of the &s;trength of Geor|gia, very far from being adequate to its defence. My &s;cheme for its &s;ecurity is, as row gallies, and armed boats are &s;o well calculated for what is called the inland navi|gation, give them an infinite advantage over ve&s;&s;els mere|ly failing, which in the&s;e &s;trait confined waters have no room for manoeuvring; they will &s;ecure the rivers again&s;t the predatory incur&s;ions of the enemy, prevent the de|&s;ertion of negroes, &s;weep the coa&s;ts clear of tenders; but, above all, facilitate the means of the different &s;tates mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other with troops, cannon, provi|&s;ion, and other requi&s;ites, which is now effected with difficulties, &s;lowne&s;s, and mon&s;trous expence. Three gal|lies are already on the &s;tocks in this port, and we have armed and equiped &s;everal boats with &s;wivels, and one gun on the bow of each. The lea&s;t of them capable of containing thirty men, and rowed with fourteen oars; &s;ailors, of whom we find &s;o great a &s;carcity, are not ne|ce&s;&s;ary for this &s;pecies of ve&s;&s;els, the &s;oldiers are compe|tent to the bu&s;ine&s;s; be&s;ides the equipment of the&s;e gal|lies and boats, I propo&s;ed e&s;tabli&s;hing little forts, or re|doubts, in certain &s;ituations, on the river St. Mary's, Satilla, Sapello, and Altamaha, which may enable us to make incur&s;ions from time to time, when circum&s;tances require it, into Ea&s;t-Florida, and render it dangerous for them to make attempts of a &s;imilar nature into Georgia. The&s;e redoubts, or little forts, will likewi&s;e &s;erve as places of rendezvous, refre&s;hment, and retreat for bodies of hor&s;e rangers which ought continually to be patroling on the frontier. Such are the be&s;t methods, after having con&s;ulted the mo&s;t intelligent people, which, in my opi|nion, can be devi&s;ed for the defence and &s;ecurity of this &s;tate, unle&s;s, indeed, we could prevail on the province, to contract their frontier, by breaking up all their &s;ettle|ments on the other &s;ide of the Altamaha, which, to me, I confe&s;s, appears a wi&s;er and more oeconomical mea|&s;ure; but this, I am afraid, is not to be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="024456_0276_0FC76DF32F9194F0">I mu&s;t now beg leave to lay before the Board, a mat|ter of the highe&s;t concern, and which certainly demands the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of Congre&s;s, as, unle&s;s reme|died, it may not only di&s;tre&s;s the circum&s;tances of the public, but bring a di&s;grace on the American character; I mean the uncon&s;cionable advantages which individu|als, merchants, mechanics, farmers, and planters are &s;uf|fered to take of the public nece&s;&s;ities. If boats, wag|gons, hor&s;es, drugs, clothing, &s;kins, nece&s;&s;aries, even lit|tle refre&s;hments, &s;uch as fruit or garden &s;tuff, are want|ing for the &s;oldiers, no price being regulated, the extor|tion is mon&s;trous: the expences of the war mu&s;t not only be prodigiou&s;ly &s;welled by this want of regulation, but the officers and &s;oldiers are di&s;gu&s;ted to the &s;ervice by the toleration of &s;uch impo&s;ition; for in&s;tance, the Virginians and North-Carolinians are &s;o much out of temper with Charle&s;ton, on this head, that &s;hould it be again attacked, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e troops be again requi&s;ite, I am afraid we &s;hall find a dangerous repug|nance in them to march, when ordered. I mo&s;t de|voutly wi&s;h, therefore, that the Congre&s;s will make it an object to remedy this evil. Might they not recommend or enjoin to the legi&s;latures of the different &s;tates, to ap|point a committee of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from their re&s;pective bodies, to &s;ix the prices of the different articles in their provin|ces?

<P>The wa&s;te, difficulty, and expence ari&s;ing from a want of method in provi&s;ioning the troops, when a&s;&s;embled in any particular &s;pot, upon an emergency, are &s;o great, that magazines ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in every province, more particularly in tho&s;e, which have the greate&s;t pro|bability of being attacked: by the&s;e means, the troops will not only be better fed, but be an immen&s;e &s;aving to the continent; for the contractors, not being pre&s;&s;ed for time, can, at their lei&s;ure, purcha&s;e every &s;pecies of nece&s;&s;aries in the&s;e parts, where they are be&s;t and cheap|e&s;t; but, when a great and &s;udden demand is made, ei|ther

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT will be nece&s;&s;ary in addre&s;&s;ing a letter of this na|ture, &s;o abruptly to your Excellency, that I &s;hould in|form you who the writer is. I have &s;erved as lieutenant-colonel in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, colonel in the Portugue&s;e, afterwards as aid de camp to his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty, with the rank of major general. Having purcha&s;ed a &s;mall e&s;tate in America, I had determined to retire, for the re|mainder of my days, to a peaceful a&s;ylum: when the ty|ranny of the mini&s;try, and court of Great Britain, forced this continent to arms, for the pre&s;ervation of their liber|ties, I was called, by the voice of the people, to the rank of &s;econd in command. I make no doubt of this letter's
<PB N="271" REF="024456_0278_0FC76DF571E57FA0">
being kindly received by your Excellency, both in the character of a good Frenchman, and friend to humanity. The pre&s;ent conjuncture of affairs renders the intere&s;t of France and of this continent one and the &s;ame thing; every ob&s;ervation drawn from hi&s;tory mu&s;t evince, that it was the exclu&s;ive commerce of the&s;e colonies, which enabled Great Britain to cope with France, gave to her a decided &s;uperiority in marine, and, of cour&s;e, enabled her in the frequent wars betwixt the two nations to re|duce her rival to the la&s;t extremity. This was the ca&s;e, &s;o peculiarly in the la&s;t war, that had the Briti&s;h mini|&s;try per&s;evered, Heaven knows what would have been the fate of France. It follows, that if France can ob|tain the monopoly, or the greater part of this commerce, her opulence, &s;trength, and pro&s;perity, mu&s;t grow to a prodigious height; and nothing can be more certain, than that, if America is enabled to pre&s;erve the indepen|dence &s;he has now declared, the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r part of this com|merce, if not the monopoly, mu&s;t fall to the &s;hare of France.</P>
<P>The imaginary plans of conque&s;t of Lewis the Four|teenth, had they been realized, would not have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the power of that monarchy, on &s;o &s;olid and per|manent a ba&s;is, as the &s;imple a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or rather friend|ly intercour&s;e with this continent, will inevitably give. Without inju&s;tice, or the colour of inju&s;tice, but, on the contrary, only a&s;&s;uming the patronage of the rights of mankind, France has now in her power to become not only the greate&s;t, but the mo&s;t truly glorious monarchy which has appeared on the &s;tage of the world. In the fir&s;t place, her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the i&s;lands will be &s;ecured again&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of attack; the Royal Revenues immen&s;ely increa&s;ed, her people ea&s;ed of their pre&s;ent burdens, an eternal incitement be pre&s;ented to their in|du&s;try, and the means of increa&s;e by the facility of pro|viding &s;u&s;tenance for their families multiplied. In &s;hort, there is no &s;aying what degree of eminence, happine&s;s, and glory, &s;he may derive from the independence of this continent. Some vi&s;ionary writers have indeed a&s;&s;erted,
<PB N="272" REF="024456_0279_0FC76DFC6F2CFB08">
that could this eountry onec &s;hake off her European trammels, it would &s;oon become more formidable alone, from the virtue and energy, natural to a young people, than Great Britain with her colonies united in a &s;tate of dependency. But the men who have built &s;uch hypo|the&s;es mu&s;t be utter &s;trangers to the manners, genius, di&s;po&s;ition, turn of mind, and circum&s;tances of the con|tinent. Their di&s;po&s;ition is manife&s;tly to agriculture, and the &s;imple life of &s;hepherds. As long as va&s;t tracts of land remain unoccupied, to which they can &s;end colo|nies (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) of their offspring, they will never entertain a thought of marine or manufactures. Their ideas are &s;olely confined to labour and to planting, for tho&s;e nations, who can, on the cheape&s;t terms, fur|ni&s;h them with the nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;ils for labouring and planting, and cloaths for their families; and till the whole va&s;t extent of continent is fully &s;tocked with peo|ple, they will never entertain another idea. This can|not be effected for ages; and what then may happen, it is out of the line of politicians to lay any &s;tre&s;s upon: mo&s;t probably, they will be employed in wars among&s;t them&s;elves, before they aim at foreign conque&s;ts. In &s;hort, the apprehen&s;ion is too remote to rou&s;e the jea|lou&s;y of any rea&s;onable citizen of a foreign State. On the other hand, it is worthy your Excellency's attention, to con&s;ider what will be the con&s;equences, &s;hould Great Britain &s;ucceed in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. America, it is true, will be wretched and en&s;laved; but a number of &s;laves may compo&s;e a formidable army and fleet. The proximity of &s;ituation, with &s;o great a force, entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of Great Britain, will put it in her power to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your i&s;lands on the fir&s;t rupture. With|out pretending to the &s;pirit of prophe&s;y, &s;uch, I can a&s;|&s;ert, will be the event of the next war; upon the whole, I mu&s;t repeat, that it is for the intere&s;t, as well as glory of France, to furni&s;h us with every means of &s;upporting our liberties, to effect which, we only demand a con&s;tant &s;y&s;tematic &s;upply of the nece&s;&s;aries of war. We do not require any aid of men, we have numbers, and, I be|lieve,
<PB N="273" REF="024456_0280_0FC76DFDB06E29B0">
courage &s;ufficient to carry us triumphantly through the &s;truggle. We require &s;mall arms, powder, fieldpieces, wollen and linen to cloath our troops; al&s;o drugs, parti|cularly bark: in return for which, every nece&s;&s;ary pro|vi&s;ion for your i&s;lands may be expected, as rice, corn, lumber, &amp;c. If, indeed, you could &s;pare us a few able engineers, and artillery officers, they may depend upon an honourable reception and comfortable e&s;tabli&s;hment. The Sieur de la Plain, one of your countrymen, now engaged in the cau&s;e of the United States of America, will have the honour of delivering this letter to your ex|cellency. I have no doubt of his being received with that politene&s;s, and kindne&s;s, to be expected from a gen|tleman of your rank and character.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF GENERAL HOWE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Camp, at Valley-Forge, <DATE>June 4th, 1778.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR RUSH,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I had no occa&s;ion for fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of your friend&s;hip, I cannot help being much plea&s;ed with the warmth which your letter, delivered to me by Mr. Hall, breathes; and, I hope, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ure you, that my &s;entiments, with re&s;pect to you, are cor|re&s;pondent.</P>
<P>You will think it odd, that I &s;hould &s;eem to be an apologi&s;t for General Howe: I know not how it hap|pens, but when I have taken prejudices in favour, or a|gain&s;t a man, I find it a difficulty in &s;haking them off. From my fir&s;t acquaintance with Mr. Howe, I liked him: I thought him friendly, candid, good natured,
<PB N="274" REF="024456_0281_0FC76DFF31A7E618">
brave, and rather &s;en&s;ible than the rever&s;e. I believe &s;till, that he is naturally &s;o; but a corrupt, or, more pro|perly, no education, the fa&s;hion of the times, and the reigning idolatry among&s;t the Engli&s;h, (particularly the &s;oldiery) for every &s;ceptered <HI>calf, wolf, hog,</HI> or <HI>a&s;s,</HI> have &s;o totally perverted his under&s;tanding and heart, that private friend&s;hip has not force &s;ufficient to keep a door open for the admittance of mercy towards political here|tics. He was be&s;ides, per&s;uaded that I was doubly cri|minal, both as a traitor and de&s;erter. In &s;hort, &s;o totally was he inebriated with this idea, that I am convinced he would have thought him&s;elf both politically and morally damned had he acted any other part than what he did. He is, be&s;ides, the mo&s;t indolent of mortals: never took farther pains to examine the merits or demerits of the cau&s;e in which he was engaged, than merely to recollect, that Great Britain was &s;aid to be the mother country, George the Third King of Great Britain, that the parli|ament was called the repre&s;entatives of Great Britain, that the King and parliament formed the &s;upreme pow|er, that a &s;upreme power is ab&s;olute and uncontrolable, that all re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t, con&s;equently, be rebellion; but, above all, that he was a &s;oldier, and bound to obey in all ca&s;es whatever.</P>
<P>The&s;e are his notions, and this his logic; but through the&s;e ab&s;urdities I could di&s;tingui&s;h, when he was left to him&s;elf, rays of friend&s;hip and good nature breaking out. It is true, he was &s;eldom left to him&s;elf; for never poor mortal, thru&s;t into high &s;tation, was &s;urrounded by &s;uch fools and &s;coundrels. M'Ken&s;ey, Balfour, Galloway, were his coun&s;ellors: they urged him to all his acts of har&s;hne&s;s; they were his &s;cribes: all the damned &s;tuff which was i&s;&s;ued to the a&s;toni&s;hed world was theirs. I believe he &s;carcely ever read the letters he &s;igned. You will &s;carcely believe it, but I can a&s;&s;ure you as a fact, that he never read the curious proclamation, i&s;&s;ued at the head of Elk, till three days after it was publi&s;hed. You will &s;ay, that I am drawing my friend Howe in more ridiculous colours than he has yet been repre&s;ented
<PB N="275" REF="024456_0282_0FC76E00B0590788">
in; but this is his real character. He is naturally good humoured, complai&s;ant, but illiterate and indolent to the la&s;t degree, unle&s;s as an executive &s;oldier, in which capa|city he is all fire and activity, brave and cool as Julius Cae&s;ar. His under&s;tanding is, as I ob&s;erved before, ra|ther good than otherwi&s;e; but was totally confounded and &s;tupified by the immen&s;ity of the ta&s;k impo&s;ed upon him. He &s;hut his eyes, fought his battles, drank his bot|tle, had his little whore, advi&s;ed with his coun&s;ellors, received his orders from North and Germain, (one more ab&s;urd than the other) took Galloway's opinion, &s;hut his eyes, fought again, and is now, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be called to account for acting according to in&s;tructions; but, I believe, his eyes are now opened; he &s;ees he has been an in&s;trument of wickedne&s;s and folly: indeed, when I ob&s;erved it to him, he not only took patiently the ob&s;er|vation, but indirectly a&s;&s;ented to the truth of it. He made, at the &s;ame time, as far as his <HI>mauvais honte</HI> would permit, an apology for his treatment of me.</P>
<P>Thus far with regard to Mr. Howe. You are &s;truck with the great events, changes, and new cnaracters which have appeared on the &s;tage &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t; but I am more &s;truck with the admirable efficacy of blunders. It &s;eemed to be a trial of &s;kill which party &s;hould outdo the other; and it is hard to &s;ay which played the deepe&s;t &s;trokes; but it was a capital one of ours, which certainly gave the happy turn which affairs have taken. Upon my &s;oul, it was time for Fortune to interpo&s;e, or we were inevitably lo&s;t; but this we will talk over another time. I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee one another at Philadelphia, very &s;oon, in attendance. God ble&s;s you!</P>

<P>WHEN an officer of the re&s;pectable rank I bear is gro&s;sly traduced and calumniated, it is incumbent on him to clear up the affair to the world, with as little delay as

po&s;&s;ible. The &s;pirit of defamation and calumny (I am &s;orry to &s;ay it) is grown to a prodigious and intolerable height on this continent. If you had accu&s;ed me of a de&s;ign to procra&s;tinate the war, or of holding a trea&s;ona|ble corre&s;pondence with the enemy, I could have borne it: this I am u&s;ed to; and this happened to the great Fabius Maximus. If you had accu&s;ed me of getting drunk as often as I could get liquor, as two Alexanders the Great have been charged with this vice, I &s;hould, perhaps, have &s;at patient under the imputation; or, even if you had given the plaine&s;t hints, that I had &s;tolen the &s;oldiers &s;hirts, this I could have put up with, as the great Duke of Marlborough would have been an example; or if you had contented your&s;elf with a&s;&s;erting, that I was &s;o abominable a &s;loven as never to part with my &s;hirt, until my &s;hirt parted with me, the anecdotes of my illu&s;|trious name&s;ake of Sweden <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles XII.</NOTE> would nave admini&s;tered &s;ome comfort to me. But the calumny you have, in the fertility of your malicious wit, cho&s;en to invent, is of &s;o new, &s;o unprecedented, and &s;o helli&s;h a kind, as would make Job him&s;elf &s;wear like a Virginia Colonel.</P>

I know you mu&s;t be mo&s;t &s;olicitous about; they have both, thank Heaven, and the good con&s;titution we receiv|ed from our father and mother, never failed me a &s;ingle day; and until I am con&s;cious of having committed &s;ome unworthy action, which, I can a&s;&s;ure you, is not at pre|&s;ent the ca&s;e, the iniquity of men &s;hall never bear me down. I have, it is true, unea&s;y feelings, but not on my own per&s;onal account. I feel for the empire of Great Britain, I feel for the fortunes of my relations and friends, which mu&s;t rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve a dreadful &s;hock in this great convul|&s;ion. As to my per&s;onal honour, for I &s;uppo&s;e you al|lude to the affair of Monmouth, all I &s;hall &s;ay is, that as I believe the proceedings of the court have been &s;ent to England, and as you have eyes to read, and capacity to judge and make proper comments, I may be quite ea&s;y on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>What has not our quondam friend Gage to an&s;wer for? I laboured, at Bo&s;ton, by a letter, to open his eyes, and he treated my efforts as the effects of republican in&s;anity. Had he li&s;tened to me, the empire of Great Britain would have &s;tood; the affection and allegiance of this great peo|ple continued for ages. He is, in fact, an&s;werable, for the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Briti&s;h empire, and for the blood of, at lea&s;t, one hundred thou&s;and Engli&s;hmen, or the immediate de&s;cendants of Engli&s;hmen. I fancy too, by this time, Lord Piercy and General Burgoyne lament that they con&s;idered my letters as the ebullition of mad|ne&s;s or faction. But as my letter mu&s;t be opened before it reaches you, any thing like politics mu&s;t be improper. God ble&s;s you my dear &s;i&s;ter. My love to the Town|&s;hends, Hunts, Bunburys, Mrs. Hinks, and the Barrets.</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR SISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE other day, by a kind act of Providence, a letter of yours fell into my hands, of &s;o late date as the 20th of March, and what is more, it had the appearance of ne|ver having been opened. You will better conceive, than I can expre&s;s, the plea&s;ure which I received from it; for I a&s;&s;ure you, that my American enthu&s;ia&s;m is at pre|&s;ent &s;o far worn off, that the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction I can receive, is to be informed of the health and welfare of my Engli&s;h friends, who, with all their political &s;ins, cor|ruptions and follies, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s more virtues, at lea&s;t, as individuals, than all the nations of the earth. As to the Americans, though I once thought otherwi&s;e, when their characters are impartially and minutely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, I am &s;ure they will appear not only de&s;titute of the per&s;onal virtues and good qualities, which render tho&s;e they de|&s;cended from &s;o e&s;timable in the eyes of other nations, &s;uch as truth, hone&s;ty, &s;incerity, and good under&s;tanding; but I am much mi&s;taken, if the great public qualities which you at a di&s;tance &s;uppo&s;e them to be endowed with, will &s;tand a &s;crutiny; but a &s;crutiny of this kind, in a letter, is not po&s;&s;ible: all that I &s;hall &s;ay is, that, the New Eng|landmen excepted, the re&s;t of the Americans, though they fancy and call them&s;elves republicans, have not a &s;ingle republican qualification or idea. They have al|ways a god of the day, who&s;e infallibility is not to be di&s;|puted: to him all the people mu&s;t bow down and &s;ing Ho&s;annas.</P>
<P>You are curious, my dear &s;i&s;ter, on the &s;ubject of my finances, and are de&s;irous to know whether the&s;e peo|ple, to whom I have &s;acrificed every thing, have &s;hewn the &s;ame black ingratitude with re&s;pect to my circum|&s;tances as they have in other matters; I can a&s;&s;ure you, then, that their actions are all of a piece. Was it not for the friend&s;hip of Mr. Robert Morris and a fortunate purcha&s;e I made, more by luck than cunning, I might have begged in the &s;treets, but without much chance of being relieved; not but that, to be ju&s;t, there are many exceptions to the general character of the Americans,
<PB N="283" REF="024456_0290_0FC76E1819BECA30">
both in and out of the army, and I think the greater number are of the latter cla&s;s, men of &s;ome honour, and who, I believe, have, from the beginning, acted on prin|ciple; and all the&s;e I may, without vanity, &s;ay, have been my friends and advocates. Among the worthies of America I reckon Mr. Robert Morris of Philadelphia; Richard Henry Lee of Virginia; Adams and Lovel, and &s;ome others, of New-England; the Morris's of New-York; and Dr. Ru&s;h of Philadelphia. In the army there are many worthy to be mentioned, Generals Schuyler, Mifflin, Sullivan, Muhlenburgh, Wayne, Weedon, Green, Knox, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have been particularly fortunate in my aid de camps &mdash;all young gentlemen of the be&s;t families, fortunes, and education of this continent; but above all, I &s;hould mention young Colonel Harry Lee, who has &s;ignalized him&s;elf extremely in this accur&s;ed conte&s;t, the ruinous con&s;equences of which to the whole empire, I predicted to Lord Piercy and to my friend General Burgoyne. To do the Americans ju&s;tice, they certainly were not the aggre&s;&s;ors, but the retro&s;pect now is of no u&s;e. In all civil conte&s;ts the people, in general, have not been the aggre&s;&s;ors; they only wi&s;h to defend, not to encroach. The monarchs or magnates generally commence by their oppre&s;&s;ions. Witne&s;s the di&s;putes betwixt the patricians and the plebeians of Rome, and our wars in the time of Charles the Fir&s;t; but the people in the conte&s;t forget the principles on which they &s;et out, which ultimately brings de&s;truction on both parties; and this I extremely appre|hend will be the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. I &s;hall now quit the labyrinths of politics, and return to the &s;ubject of my own finances. Mr. Mure has u&s;ed me mo&s;t cruelly and villanou&s;ly; notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t &s;ums he owes me, he has prote&s;ted a bill of three hundred pounds, which has thrown me into un&s;peakable di&s;tre&s;s. He has affected a delicacy in honouring the bills or a rebel; but if he will con&s;ult the proclamation of Sir Henry Clinton, in the year &s;eventy-eight, he will find that I am exempt|ed from the apprehen&s;ion of confi&s;cation by the terms of
<PB N="284" REF="024456_0291_0FC76E1E1EC6A1B0">
this proclamation, which declares, That no man, from the date hereof, who does not po&s;itively act in a civil or military capacity, is &s;ubject to the confi&s;cation of his property; but as I have rea&s;on to think that the man will avail him&s;elf of every chicane, when money is in the ca&s;e, I mu&s;t entreat that you will urge Sir Charles Bun|bury and Davers to endeavour to influence him, at lea&s;t to furni&s;h Mr. Garton, for my u&s;e, with five, four, or at lea&s;t three hundred pounds until the conte&s;t is over, and the law, according to the terms of peace, tells us what is to be done; but, at any rate, he, Mr. Mure, can have no claim as an individual to my fortune: he mu&s;t ac|count for it to &s;omebody.</P>
<P>I am extremely concerned at the embara&s;&s;ment our cou&s;in S&mdash; gives you with regard to the legacy, but it is the very error of the moon; &s;he comes more near the earth than &s;he was wont to do, and makes men mad. Is my worthie&s;t friend Butler alive, and among&s;t you? if he is, a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings, in my name, on his head. God Almighty, my dear &s;i&s;ter, give you long life, ea&s;e, and &s;pirits, is devoutly the wi&s;h of</P>
