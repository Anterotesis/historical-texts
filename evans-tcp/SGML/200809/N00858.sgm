<P>I Shall not &s;pend much Time in pur&s;uit of the coherence and occa&s;ion of the&s;e words. The wi&s;e man tells us, at <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 16. and 17. of the foregoing <HI>Chapter,</HI> how difficult and inextricable he had, upon &s;earch, found the works of the <HI>Divine Providence</HI> to be; which he proceeds, in the beginning of this <HI>Chapter,</HI> to in&s;tance in one very ob&s;ervable Remark on the works of God in the promi&s;cuous &amp; indi&s;tingui&s;hable Events which befal the Be&s;t and Wor&s;t of men: from whence men have taken occa&s;ion Athei&s;ti|cally, to deny the <HI>Providence</HI> of God in the Government of <HI>Humane</HI> Affairs, and a&s;cribed all Events to <HI>Fortune,</HI> or <HI>Chance</HI>; Concluding
<PB N="4" REF="001034_0003_0FAEE9BF11DDA778">
thereupon, that it is altogether a fruitle&s;s thing to &s;erve God: and Con&s;equently, in|dulging of them&s;elves in all the mad Cour|&s;es, which their carnal Lu&s;ts &s;timulate them unto, till at length they Dy like Bea&s;ts. That things do thus indifferently fall out in the world, he readily &s;ub&s;cribes to, and fully declares, in <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 2. but yet he praefaceth it with a founda|tion <HI>Article,</HI> to prevent <HI>Athei&s;m, ver&s;e</HI> 1. viz&middot; <HI>That all the works of Good men are in Gods Hand; i. e.</HI> under His in&s;pection and management; and Con&s;equently, that they &s;hall be no lo&s;ers in the end. Though he was not able to trace all the rea&s;ons of Gods works, yet he re&s;olved, that he would hold this Clue in his hand, to keep him from being lo&s;t in the <HI>Labirinth.</HI> And truly, if we do not hold this fa&s;t as a principle of Faith, <HI>viz.</HI> that God wi&s;ely Governs all the affairs of the Creatures, we &s;hall &s;oon lo&s;e our &s;elves in tracing the <HI>Meanders</HI> of His <HI>Pro|vidence.</HI></P>
<P>In this <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> there are two things to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. A General <HI>A&s;&s;ertion: All things come alike to all; there is one event.</HI> Which mu&s;t be under&s;tood in a limited &s;en&s;e. By, <HI>All things,</HI> we are not to under&s;tand every Di&s;pen&s;ation of God to the Children of men; for God Graciou&s;ly reveals Him&s;elf in Chri&s;t unto &s;ome,
<PB N="5" REF="001034_0004_0FAEE9C097060718">
and leaves others wholly without this <HI>Revela|tion</HI>: And &s;ome are &s;o Conducted by His Pro|vidence, as to be finally brought unto Glory; whereas others are left to them&s;elves, and at la&s;t fall into everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery. But it in|tends only the outward Di&s;pen&s;ation of Gods Providence, with regard to the affairs of this Life, and all the changes of it, Health and Sickne&s;s, Pro&s;perity and Adver&s;ity, Life and Death. And when he &s;aith, <HI>There is one Event to all</HI>; it is not to be taken <HI>Individually,</HI> as if every man were carried through the &s;ame Con|dition of Life, in all the particular pa&s;&s;ages of it; the contrary to which, is very obvious to all that ob&s;erve the various &s;tates of men in this world: Some are in Pro&s;perity, when others are &s;unk deep in Adver&s;ity; &s;ome are in Health, when others are Sick; &s;ome Dy in their Youth, while others Live to old Age <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But he intends it of all <HI>Sorts</HI> of men, and of Individuals only &s;o far, as that they are al|ways liable to, and have no &s;ecurity again&s;t the like Condition, none <HI>Being</HI> exempted from it. His meaning is, that the events of Provi|dence are in this regard, &s;uch to one and ano|ther, that there is no Judgment to be made of their being either <HI>Loved</HI> or <HI>Hated</HI> by God, from the ob&s;ervation that we make upon them; Or, that this is no Rule for us to Judge of mens State by. Hence;</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="001034_0005_0FAEE9C180F62B88">2. He di&s;tributes the Subjects, to whom the&s;e Events befal, into two ranks or orders, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Godly</HI> and the <HI>Wicked:</HI> To one of which Heads, every individual per&s;on is to be annumerated; for there is no middle &s;tate between the&s;e two. And he commorates on the Charactarizing of tho&s;e two &s;orts, by laying down of &s;everal notes, by which they are differenced one from the other; One of which is expre&s;&s;ed in the clo&s;e of this <HI>ver&s;e</HI> The <HI>Wicked</HI> are called &s;uch as <HI>Swear</HI>; not that every one that Swears is a wicked man, for it is &s;ometimes a Duty &s;o to do; and the thing it &s;elf appertains to the true Religion: but &s;uch as are vain and common Swearers. The <HI>Godly</HI> are termed &s;uch as <HI>Fear an Oath</HI>; and this is the only thing that I am now concern|ed withal in the following Di&s;cour&s;e. Some under&s;tand the&s;e words to be <HI>Synechdochical,</HI> and that by the <HI>Swearer</HI> is intended every lewd Sinner, who allows him&s;elf in a cour&s;e of wick|edne&s;s: And that by him who <HI>Fears an Oath,</HI> we are to under&s;tand &s;uch an one, as takes heed to all his wayes le&s;t in any of them he &s;hould Sin again&s;t God; and &s;uch a man|ner of <HI>Speech</HI> is very frequently to be ob|&s;erved in the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> However, the mentioning of it under this Con&s;ideration, not only intimates that this is one of the things
<PB N="7" REF="001034_0006_0FAEE9C3F11333B0">
that belong to true Piety, but al&s;o that it hath a &s;pecial concern in the di&s;covery of it, and for that rea&s;on de&s;erves a particular ani|madver&s;ion to be made upon, it. The word which is here tran&s;lated <HI>Feareth,</HI> properly &s;ignifies, and is for the mo&s;t part made u&s;e of in the word of God, for a <HI>Reverential Fear,</HI> which proceeds from a Venerable re&s;pect that we entertain for the Object of it, which pro|duceth an aw in us, which makes us to apply our &s;elves to it with greate&s;t Caution.</P>
<P>Whence ob&s;erve this,</P>
<P><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That every truly Godly man hath implanted in him, and practically maintains a Reverential Fear of an Oath.</P>
<P>This is one Charactari&s;tical note by which the Spirit of God here expre&s;&s;eth the difference between a Godly and a Wicked man; this man Swears at random, whereas the other &s;tands in aw of an Oath. To wave all other di&s;cour&s;e on this point, this weighty CASE of Con&s;cience may come under our Delibe|ration, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What is that Fear of an Oath, that belongs to the Character of one that is truly Godly?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001034_0007_0FAEE9C4C8032D90"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> In general; Let us ob&s;erve, that a thing may be &s;aid to be Charactari&s;tical of another thing, in a double re&s;pect.</P>
<P N="1">1. Negatively; <HI>When, though the being of it doth not nece&s;&s;arily infer the Conclu&s;ion, yet the ab&s;ence of it e&s;tabli&s;heth the Contrary conclu|&s;ion.</HI> There are &s;ome commendable things, which may be found in an Unregenerate man, and therefore cannot of them&s;elves argue that the per&s;on who hath them is truly Pious: yet if he have them not, it will be a notorious proof of him to be Impious, and Unregenerate. A Natural man may by the light and influence of his Natural Con&s;cience, ab&s;tain from the trade of <HI>Common Swearing,</HI> and be al&s;o very Cautious about an <HI>Oath,</HI> when he is called to take one: if then a man who makes a great pretence to Holine&s;s, is not thus Con|&s;cientious and Cautious, he in <HI>works Denies,</HI> that which he in <HI>words Profe&s;&s;eth</HI>: this therefore is not to be excluded from the matter under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. Affirmatively: <HI>When it is a proper note of the Subject that is enquired for, and will dif|ference it from all others</HI> And this may be Con|&s;idered either <HI>Specifically</HI> or <HI>Individually</HI>: And under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration, it is that
<PB N="9" REF="001034_0008_0FAEE9C51CF3F108">
which is &s;pecifical that we are &s;eeking after; for the Que&s;tion is, <HI>Who is Godly,</HI> and, <HI>Who is Wicked</HI>? And the re&s;olution of it is to be &s;ought under this Character. There is there|fore &s;uch a Fear about Swearing, in one that is truly Gracious, which is not to be found in one that is Unconvert&eacute;d. And I &s;hall have regard to both of the&s;e Con&s;iderations in the re&s;olution of the Ca&s;e that is before us.</P>
<P>For a more di&s;tinct laying of this matter open, we may as Introductory to the thing, take a &s;hort account of the Nature of an Oath, by which we may di&s;cover the right foundation of this Fear, and what is the genuine ope|ration of it.</P>
<P><HI>An Oath is a &s;olemn Appeal, made by a Rea|&s;onable Creature unto God, for the Confirmation of the Truth and Credit of his Testimony.</HI> The u&s;e of an Oath is <HI>Civil,</HI> it being de&s;igned for the upholding of Truth and Credit in Humane concerns, or matters wherein one man hath to do with another, which mu&s;t be, whiles man is naturally and nece&s;&s;arily a Soci|able Creature. Sinful men are too much ad|dicted to Fal&s;hood; for, <HI>every man is a Liar,</HI> as to the inclination of his Natural Cor|ruption: but an Oath carries awe in it, and hath a <HI>Moral Obligation</HI> in the very Nature of it, to bind men to the Truth, in that
<PB N="10" REF="001034_0009_0FAEE9C5D9B957A8">
which they Swear unto, Men are al&s;o apt to be Jealous one of another, in point of Veracity, and have manifold occa&s;ions to ex|cite this Jealou&s;ly; whereas common Charity bids us to hope, that men have &s;o much of the Dread of an Oath upon them, as will make them afraid of adding it for the Con|firmation of a Lye. And hence, an Oath is <HI>Ever</HI> an <HI>Appendix</HI> to a <HI>Testimony,</HI> for that is the matter about which it is concerned: And it is for the better &s;atisfaction of men, in the maintaining of Communion one with another, of which <HI>Truth</HI> is the main pillar and &s;up|porter. An Oath therefore is Attributed to God, not <HI>Properly,</HI> but <HI>Analogically,</HI> or &s;peak|ing after the manner of men, when He rati|fies. His Promi&s;es or Threatnings, by &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ions as are &s;uited to our Conceptions. But, though an Oath be <HI>Civil</HI> in its u&s;e, yet it is <HI>Sacred</HI> in its nature, it being an Act of Wor&s;hip; and is u&s;ually referred to the <HI>Third Commandment,</HI> having God immediately for its Object, and requiring great Reverence of Him in the u&s;ing of it; for, it is an appeal unto God, who knows all things, and as He is acknowledged &s;o to do, to be a witne&s;s of the Truth &amp; Sincerity of the thing which we atte&s;t unto, and of our Hearts in it. It therefore always, Implicitly at lea&s;t, if not Explicitly, contains in it an <HI>Hypothetical Imprecation, viz.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="001034_0010_0FAEE9C6AB0DE578">
that the God of Truth would make us Ex|amples of His righteous Di&s;plea&s;ure, if we Lye: thus much, and nothing le&s;s is included in every Oath. And this is the greate&s;t &s;e|curity that men can give to others of their <HI>Veracity</HI>; and doth morally leave the great|e&s;t awe upon the Con&s;ciences of men.</P>
<P>Now, an Oath in regard of the matter of it, and as it re&s;pects the Circum&s;tance of Time to which it refers, may come under a double Con&s;ideration, <HI>viz.</HI> in re&s;pect of the <HI>Time pa&s;t,</HI> or of the <HI>Time to come</HI>: For in re|gard to the <HI>Time pre&s;ent,</HI> the thing it &s;elf giveth its own evidence, and &s;o an Oath about it, is &s;uperfluous. In the former regard it is an <HI>A&s;&s;ertory</HI> Oath, becau&s;e it gives a Te&s;ti|mony that &s;uch things or actions have already been, about which enquiry is made, and the truth of them is thus to be made evident. In the latter re&s;pect it is called, either a <HI>Pro|mi&s;&s;ory</HI> Oath, when we bring our &s;elves under the mo&s;t Religious obligation, either to <HI>God,</HI> and this is u&s;ually called a <HI>Vow</HI>; or to <HI>Men,</HI> for the performance of any thing, in which God may be Glorified, or men may be be|nefited by us. Or <HI>Minatory,</HI> when we bind our &s;elves Solemnly, to take revenge upon men for &s;ome injuries done us; an example whereof is in <HI>David,</HI> when he Swore revenge
<PB N="12" REF="001034_0011_0FAEE9C79A4E5060">
upon <HI>Nabal</HI> for the abu&s;e he had offered him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 25.22. Thus we have taken a brief account of the matter it &s;elf, about which this Fear is exerci&s;ed, in which al&s;o we have ground offered us to ob&s;erve, the rea&s;on why all good men ought to be thus Fearful.</P>
<P>We now proceed to Con&s;ider the thing it &s;elf, or the Fear of an Oath which the Godly men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed withal: And here, we may fir&s;t take notice of the Nature of Religious Fear, and then enquire what influence it hath on a Godly man to Regulate him about an Oath?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As to</HI> Religious Fear, <HI>it is often u&s;ed in the Scriptures comprehen&s;ively, for all true</HI> Piety, <HI>con&s;i&s;ting in the New nature, or the Graces of Regeneration, which are infu&s;ed into us by the Spirit of God in</HI> Conver&s;ion; <HI>and are the Root and Spring of that New-Obedience which we pay to Him.</HI> So Job 23.28. <HI>The Fear of God, that is Wi&s;dom.</HI> Eccle&s;. 12.13. <HI>Fear God, and keep His Commandments, for that is the whole of man.</HI> But more &s;pecially, it is u&s;ed for that Reve|rend re&s;pect we have for God, which makes us very careful to do all the things that plea&s;e Him; and to avoid what&s;oever we apprehend will provoke Him, or grieve His Holy Spirit. It derives from a cordial Love which we have for God, on the account of His being our God
<PB N="13" REF="001034_0012_0FAEE9C81A692778">
and Father in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and all the ob|ligations that He hath therein laid us under, by admitting of us into that precious rela|tion unto Him: And it con&s;i&s;ts in a Child|like obedience unto Him; binding us to u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours to return Him a reci|procal Love agreeable to &s;uch a Relation, which is exerted in an univer&s;al Conformity to His revealed Will; and is at all times ex|cited in us, by a practical E&s;teem which we carefully maintain in our Hearts, making us to value His Love to be better than Life it &s;elf, and to dread His Di&s;plea&s;ure at us far more than Death. And this is Ever accompani|ed with a deep &s;en&s;e of our own Sinful infir|mity, and aptne&s;s to offend through the Cor|ruption which remaineth in us, and the de|ceitfulne&s;s and eagerne&s;s which there is in the Law in our Members; together with the indefatigable endeavour of Satan our great Adver&s;ary, to Tempt and Sollicit us unto Sin: which excites in us an Holy Jealou&s;y over our &s;elves, and puts us upon Circum&s;pection in every &s;tep we take in our Conver&s;ation, le&s;t we &s;hould do any thing which is unworthy of our Name and Profe&s;&s;ion. This is that which is u&s;ually called <HI>Filial Fear,</HI> in oppo&s;iti|on to that <HI>Servile Fear</HI> which is in wicked men, who&s;e Obedience is not that of <HI>Children,</HI> but of <HI>Slaves</HI>; and though they do many Du|ties,
<PB N="14" REF="001034_0013_0FAEE9C8EBB68188">
and ab&s;tain from the external acts of many Sins, yet it is not becau&s;e they Love God and His Service, but becau&s;e their Con|&s;ciences are terrified with His Threatnings: and therefore, when they can &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e Terrours, they can Sin with delight. Now if a Chri&s;tian will try him&s;elf by any of his actions, whether he be truly Godly; as he mu&s;t fir&s;t enquire, whether he do the things that are proper to be done, or are agreeable in the matter of them, to the Divine precept; &s;o he mu&s;t not <HI>Re&s;t</HI> there, but reduce them to this <HI>Principle</HI> and try if they are influenced by this Reverential Fear of God: for in the other, an Unregenerate man may po&s;&s;ibly go as far as he. But as to the Judgment of Charity, which we are to exerci&s;e towards others, we can but look upon the things them&s;elves that they do, and the care and con&s;tancy which they u&s;e about the doing of them, and the remorce that they expre&s;s when at any time they fail in their performances.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Now let us enquire what influence this Fear hath into a Godly man, to regulate him about an Oath?</HI> And here, we mu&s;t premi&s;e, that al|lowance is to be made for the remainder of Sinful Corruption, which is in the be&s;t of Gods people, while in this life, which &s;ometimes prevails &s;o far as to lead them Captive, and
<PB N="15" REF="001034_0014_0FAEEA051FC95058">
draw them into things unworthy of their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion: but yet we are to Conclude, that ac|cording to the Tract and Tenour of their Con|ver&s;ation in this world, they will carefully endeavour to live in the exerci&s;e of Grace, and &s;tudiou&s;ly Conform to the directions of the Spirit, given them in the precepts of His word. There are therefore &s;everal things wherein this Fear will di&s;cover its activity in regard of an <HI>Oath,</HI> and that both with re&s;pect to them&s;elves, and to others.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>With re&s;pect to them&s;elves.</HI> The Chri&s;ti|ans fir&s;t <HI>Care</HI> begins at home, how he may order him&s;elf aright, &amp; &s;o as to keep a good Con&s;cience towards God, &amp; towards man; &amp; this Holy Fear will &s;timulate him unto it: and upon the account of an <HI>Oath,</HI> it will in&s;tigate him;</P>
<P N="1">1. Negatively, <HI>Not to make him to refu&s;e at all to Swear when he is called unto it.</HI> The <HI>Fear</HI> of God doth not lead men to <HI>Super&s;tition,</HI> tho' it makes them to keep clo&s;e to the Command: nor is it to hinder <HI>Duty,</HI> but to put us into a right frame for the doing of it, and then to make us afraid of bringing our &s;elves under the Guilt of neglecting it. That all <HI>Swearing</HI> is forbidden to Chri&s;tians in <HI>Go&s;pel-times,</HI> is Erro|neou&s;ly argued from Mat. 5.34. <HI>I &s;ay unto ye, Swear not at all; neither by Heaven, &amp;c.</HI> and
<PB N="16" REF="001034_0015_0FAEEA05B94BF030">
in <HI>James</HI> 5.12. where the &s;ame precept is re|peated: For our <HI>Saviour</HI> and the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> after Him, do there only forbid Common <HI>Swearing,</HI> in ordinary Communication; and <HI>Swearing</HI> by Fal&s;e objects, to which an <HI>Oath</HI> ought not to be addre&s;&s;ed. Not only is God Him&s;elf fre|quently brought in <HI>Swearing,</HI> in the <HI>Scripture</HI>; And Holy men, both in the times of the Law, and of the Go&s;pel, doing it after the mo&s;t So|lemn manner; but God Him&s;elf hath appointed an <HI>Oath,</HI> to be the la&s;t remedy again&s;t endle&s;s quarrels; and to put a final i&s;&s;ue to Controver|&s;ies between men, Exod. 22.11. <HI>Then &s;hall an Oath of the Lord be between them both, &amp;c.</HI> Yea, <HI>Swearing by Gods Name,</HI> is u&s;ed for a di&s;tingui&s;h|ing note between the True and Fal&s;e <HI>Religion, Jer.</HI> 4.2. <HI>Thou &s;halt Swear, the Lord Liveth, &amp;c.</HI> Zeph. 1.5. <HI>That Swear by the Lord, and that Swear by Malcham.</HI> And there are tho&s;e Calls in the Providence of God wherein, if a man witholds his Oath, he will both di&s;honour God, and injure his Neighbour, and when it is &s;o, this <HI>Fear</HI> will put him upon doing the thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Po&s;itively, <HI>And here are divers things wherein this Fear will exert it &s;elf</HI>;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>He dares not to drive a trade of Common Swearing.</HI> There are &s;ome that can hardly &s;peak without an Oath; they account it the be&s;t <HI>Rhe|torick</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="001034_0016_0FAEEA06C0A000F0">
they can grace their language withal; or to be &s;ure, upon every &s;light provocation which is offered them, and particularly, if o|thers do but &s;o much as make a que&s;tion about the truth of what they &s;ay, it will put them into a great pa&s;&s;ion, and they will vent it with Oath upon Oath: <HI>But &s;o doth not this man, be|cau&s;e of the fear of God.</HI> This &s;ort of Swearing is therefore in the Word of God branded as a note of an Ungodly man, and is ob&s;erved to be one of the &s;ins which do evidence a de&s;pe|rate Apo&s;ta&s;y, when it is commonly practi&s;ed, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 4 2. <HI>By Swearing, &amp;c.

So that the habit of this argues that &s;uch a man hath not the fear of God in him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He dares not to Swear at all, unle&s;s he ap|prehends that he hath a clear call for it in the Pro|vidence of God. i e.</HI> When the ca&s;e &amp; the occa&s;i|on call for it, and he is convinced that he &s;hall omit a plain Duty, if he denies it. When Gods Name will be di&s;honoured, or men will injuriou&s;ly &s;uffer, either in repute, or e&s;tate, or life; or when crying &s;ins will go unpuni&s;hed for want of his &s;olemn Te&s;timony, for their legal Conviction who are guilty of them. He
<PB N="18" REF="001034_0017_0FAEEA075A1611F0">
will not unnece&s;&s;arily thru&s;t him&s;elf upon Swearing, but will wait till either God, or men al&s;o do call him to it. On this account Cri|ticks have ob&s;erved, that in the Old Te&s;ta|ment, the <HI>Verb</HI> u&s;ed for <HI>Swearing,</HI> is never ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Active,</HI> but always in the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive</HI> voice; it is not <HI>to Swear,</HI> but to <HI>be Sworn</HI>; in|timating that the Godly man is ever put up|on it, by lawful authority.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>He cautiou&s;ly ab&s;tains from all language which borders upon Swearing.</HI> There is an <HI>Ex|plicit,</HI> and there is an <HI>Implicit</HI> Swearing; there is an Oath in the form of it, and an Oath in the import of it; and that which if it can|not be ab&s;olutely &s;o called, yet comes as near it as can be, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;trong <HI>A&s;&s;everations</HI> to con|firm what is &s;aid by, &s;uch, as, <HI>in faith, in truth, as I live, by the life of Pharaoh, as thy Soul lives, &amp;c.</HI> And undue <HI>Imprecations</HI> on our &s;elves to gain credit by, &s;uch as, <HI>I wi&s;h I may never &s;peak more, if I ly</HI>; and many the like. A Godly man dareth not to &s;how him&s;elf in this kind of language, becau&s;e he feareth an Oath, and knows how much of the nature of one there is in it, and how leading it is to introduce a more daring &s;ort of Swearing. He knows that this is more than <HI>yea,</HI> and <HI>nay,</HI> which our Saviour limits our ordinary Com|munication unto, and mu&s;t needs be evil;
<PB N="19" REF="001034_0018_0FAEEA07CFE87AB0">
<HI>Mat.</HI> 5.37. <HI>Let your Communication be, yea, yea, nay, nay, for whatever is more than the&s;e, cometh of evil.</HI> He di&s;tingui&s;heth between an <HI>A&s;&s;erti|on,</HI> and an <HI>A&s;&s;everation,</HI> and is afraid to pro|ceed in this latter, except he have a manife&s;t call to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>He dares not to Swear ra&s;hly.</HI> One qua|lity of a right Oath, is that it be <HI>in Judgment, Jer.</HI> 4.2. And this doubtle&s;s includes in it the mans u&s;ing of his deliberate Judgment about it, before he adventures upon it: and this is quite contrary to ra&s;hne&s;s. Which deliberati|on hath reference to every kind of Oath that a man may be put upon. He avoideth ra&s;h|ne&s;s in an <HI>A&s;&s;ertory</HI> Oath; he will fir&s;t ponder well what he Swears, whether it be certain|ly true, whether it will be any thing to the purpo&s;e for which it is de&s;ired, whether he certainly knows it by his own per&s;onal knowledge to be &s;o, whether it be the whole Truth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In a <HI>Promi&s;&s;ory</HI> Oath; he will not be ha&s;ty to bind his Soul, but he will enquire whether it be a thing lawful, whether he hath any ju&s;t rea&s;on or call to do it, whe|ther he &s;hall not bring him&s;elf into an un|nece&s;&s;ary &s;nare by it, whether it be in his power, whether he doth cordially purpo&s;e to perform it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in a <HI>Minatory</HI> Oath he will con&s;ider, whether it be not a <HI>Per&s;onal re|venge</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="001034_0019_0FAEEA08979A34B0">
which he is about thus to oblige him|&s;elf to, and thereby is going about to take Gods work out of his hands, who hath &s;aid, <HI>Rom</HI> 12.19. <HI>Vengeance is mine, I will repay</HI>; and thereupon he &s;hall have cau&s;e to be a&s;ha|med, and repent of, and revoke his Oath with Repentance, as <HI>David</HI> did in regard of his, 1 <HI>Sam</HI> 25. (and indeed their &s;in and folly is here to be taken notice of, who think if they have Sworn, or &s;olemnly prote&s;ted to do a thing, or not to do a thing, though it be in it&s;elf &s;inful, they are yet bound to &s;tand by it; as if any obligation, could make <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Duty to &s;in and continue in it.) Or whether it be in Gods Cau&s;e, and he hath a clear call from God thus to engage him&s;elf in it, as an In&s;trument of Gods Vindictive Ju|&s;tice.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>He dares not to Swear Equivocally.</HI> He knows that God hath required that if he Swear, it be <HI>in Truth, Jer.</HI> 4.2. And he hath not learned how nicely to di&s;tingui&s;h between an equivocation and a ly. He is afraid of Swearing deceitfully; for this is given as one note of a Child of God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 24.4. <HI>Who hath not lift up his Soul to vanity, nor &s;worn deceitful|ly.</HI> He dares not to Swear to one thing, and intend another, by a <HI>mental re&s;ervation,</HI> which is quite contrary. Nor to Swear to a part of
<PB N="21" REF="001034_0020_0FAEEA09855FEE48">
the Truth, and hide the other part, which if it were expre&s;&s;ed, would change the &s;en&s;e to a contrary, or at lea&s;t a divers interpretation, and quite alter the ca&s;e to which he gives in his Te&s;timony; knowing that the de&s;ign of an Oath is to advance <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Jer.</HI> 4 2. And not to cover iniquity. He dreads the invoking of the God of Truth, to bear wit|ne&s;s to a fal&s;hood, and he believes that &s;uch Oaths as the&s;e are no better.</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>He will Swear by no other Name but that of the true God:</HI> The name that we invoke in Swearing, is therein practically acknowledged by us to be God, for in it we call him to wit|ne&s;s, who both knows the Secrets of our hearts, and can call us to an account, judge and condemn us, and take vengeance upon us, if we bear witne&s;s to an untruth; and this can be none but God. To appeal to any other but him in this ca&s;e, is manife&s;t <HI>Idolatry:</HI> for we make him our God, whom we Swear by, &amp; if that be not the true God, it mu&s;t needs be an Idol which we thus wor&s;hip, which every true Chri&s;tian is afraid to do, le&s;t he &s;hould provoke the God of Heaven to Jea|lou&s;y. Hence we have that threatning, <HI>Amos</HI> 8 14. <HI>They that Swear by the Sin of Samaria, and &s;ay, thy God, O Dan, liveth, and the manner of Beer&s;heba liveth, even they &s;hall fall, and never ri&s;e up again.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="22" REF="001034_0021_0FAEEA0A16628F70">7. <HI>He dares not to Swear either in favour of or in prejudice again&s;t any per&s;on.</HI> He hath a re&s;pect entirely to the Truth, in the Te&s;timo|ny that he thus giveth in, and is not bia&s;&s;ed by any re&s;pect unto men. Neither doth the fear of man make him to baulk the truth in one Syllable, nor will he take an advantage to wreck his own malice, by his Te&s;timony, upon tho&s;e who have given him any apparent provocation. This was <HI>Doegs</HI> Sin, and there|fore, though for the &s;ub&s;tance he &s;pake the truth, yet is he on this account charged with <HI>a Lying Tongue, P&s;al.</HI> 52. <HI>begin.</HI> But this, he that fears God, abhors.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>He ever Swears under the awful apprehen|&s;ion that God is both Witne&s;s and Judge.</HI> He doth it alway with remembring that he is now in the pre&s;ence of the Great God, who loveth, the truth, and hateth lying; who knows, and will take Vengeance. He can truly &s;ay, at &s;uch time as he thus calls upon God in Swearing, as <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 119.120. <HI>My fle&s;h trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> He thinks of the dreadful <HI>flying Roll,</HI> and is under the aw of that terrible threatning in regard of it, <HI>Zech.</HI> 5.4. <HI>I will bring it forth, and it &s;hall enter into the hou&s;e of him that Sweareth fal&s;ely by my
<PB N="23" REF="001034_0022_0FAEEA0AF9694400">
Name; and it &s;hall remain in the mid&s;t of his hou&s;e, and &s;hall con&s;ume it, with the timber there|of, and the &s;tones thereof.</HI> And it makes him exceeding cautious. Hence he dares not to Swear to any thing doubtingly, or upon a meer &s;urmize, or &s;trong imagination, but only what his Con&s;cience is clear, and abun|dantly &s;atisfyed in, ever &s;u&s;pecting his eyes, his ears, his memory; till he be fully a&s;&s;ured of the Truth.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In re&s;pect of Others.</HI> This fear is not li|mited only to him&s;elf per&s;onally, but it extends both in Ju&s;tice and Charity to others al&s;o. He is concerned both for the Glory of God, and for the be&s;t good of his Neighbours; and therefore, whether they are afraid of an Oath or no, yet he fears for them, and will exerci&s;e his fear in this regard, &s;o far as duty calls him to it; and there are tho&s;e things wherein his Con&s;cience obligeth him to duty on this ac|count. Here therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He trembleth at, and will reprove vain and fal&s;e Swearing in others.</HI> There is a Guilt which may be contracted, by a mans holding his peace on this account; <HI>Levit.</HI> 5 1. <HI>If a Soul Sin, and heareth the voice of Swearing, if he do not utter it, he &s;hall bear his iniquity.</HI> Gods Name is taken in vain by &s;uch things,
<PB N="24" REF="001034_0023_0FAEEA0BBAC1D308">
and this a Godly man cannot bear patiently to hear, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 139.19, 20, 21. He dares not to be a partaker in other mens Sins, and therefore will &s;ome way or other appear for God, and bear &s;ome manife&s;t witne&s;s to his di&s;like of the&s;e things. He will not therefore keep company with common Swear|ers, but &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid them, and, as there is opportunity, wi&s;ely and zealou&s;ly rebuke them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He dares not to &s;ollicit, much le&s;s to hire any to Swear in a wrong cau&s;e.</HI> He doth not think it enough, him&s;elf to refrain from taking &s;uch an Oath, but is afraid of being any way in&s;trumental of encouraging others &s;o to do. He knows that what others do by his per&s;wa&s;ion, if it be a Sin, will involve him in the Guilt of it, and expo&s;e him to the righteous Anger of God, which he dreads. If therefore he knows any to offer &s;uch a Te&s;timony upon Oath, though there might accrue an outward advantage to him&s;elf by it, yet he rejects it with greate&s;t dete&s;tation: and if any &s;uch fal&s;e Oath be given within his Cognizance, he will, as far as lyeth in his power, detect it, and te&s;tify again&s;t it. Much le&s;s then will he ask and bribe any thus to do. This was <HI>Jezebels</HI> Sin, in &s;uborning Knights of the Po&s;t, to Swear hone&s;t <HI>Naboth</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="001034_0024_0FAEEA0C6966D0E0">
out of his Life and Living; and God threatens de&s;truction upon her, and all her Family, for it: and he takes in&s;truction by this. He loves his Neighbour too well, for him thus to ruine his Soul for ever; and he loves him|&s;elf better, than thus to pull down Gods wrath on his own head.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>He is afraid of the Judgments of God come|ing upon &s;uch a Land where this Swearing abounds.</HI> Every Godly man loves and longs for the peace and pro&s;perity of his people; and there|fore, when he teeth any <HI>Moral Pre&s;ages</HI> of Gods wrath impending over them, it makes him afraid, and puts him into bitterne&s;s of Soul. Now he knows that where &s;inful Swearing prevails, and it comes to be an E|pidemical di&s;temper among a people, it is a certain Symptom of Judgments ready to break in upon &s;uch a Land, becau&s;e God hath Solemnly threatned them for this Sin. God hath told us, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.10. <HI>Becau&s;e of Swear|ing the Land mourneth.</HI> And in, <HI>Ho&s;</HI> 4 2, 3. <HI>By Swearing,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>they break out; therefore &s;hall the Land mourn, and every one that dwells therein &s;hall langui&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. And this makes him to mourn in Secret places, and bitterly to lament the direful Progno&s;ticks of the de&s;olating Judgments which he &s;eeth in their cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="26" REF="001034_0025_0FAEEA0D2DD287A0">4. <HI>If he be a per&s;on ve&s;ted with Civil Au|thority, this fear will make him very careful how he Admini&s;treth an Oath to others.</HI> There are many occa&s;ions in the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice among men, to make u&s;e of an Oath: the &s;ins and corruptions that are in men, ren|der it very nece&s;&s;ary, and it cannot be always avoided, con&s;i&s;tent with Righteou&s;ne&s;s: men mu&s;t otherwi&s;e lo&s;e their right, and not be a|ble to recover the wrongs that have been done to their Per&s;ons, Names, E&s;tates, and &s;candalous Crimes which will not otherwi&s;e be legally detected. God hath therefore or|dained <HI>Civil Judicatories</HI> for this very purpo&s;e, and authorized men in Authority to manage the&s;e Affairs: but it is certain that a Godly Judge will apply this part of his Authority in fear; and that more e&s;pecially in the&s;e three regards</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He will not do it, but when there is a ju&s;t cau&s;e requiring of it.</HI> Mens corruptions will prompt them to obtrude Oaths without rea|&s;on, and to attempt to multiply them be|yond need, and though two or three are by the Word of God declared &s;ufficient in any one matter, yet they will urge to have a great many more, and reckon them&s;elves in|jured if they may not have their de&s;ire in
<PB N="27" REF="001034_0026_0FAEEA0E5D2D3918">
the&s;e regards complied withal; but a righte|ous Judge will allow or re&s;train them in <HI>Judgment, Jer.</HI> 4.2. For that is as well to be applied to him who admits of the Oath, as him to whom it is given. Men will often offer Oaths that are altogether impertinent, and have no tendency in them to clear and confirm the ca&s;e, which they are pretended to be brought for: but he will not let them pa&s;s promi&s;cuou&s;ly, but only admit of tho&s;e that are to the purpo&s;e, and will &s;erve to the ends of Civil Ju&s;tice. To take needle&s;s Oaths without weighing of them before hand, is to &s;uffer the <HI>Name of God to be taken in Vain,</HI> which he dares not to do.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He will carefully enquire into the quality or fitne&s;s of the Jurants.</HI> Some men are not fit to give in an Oath at all, and it may not be convenient for others to do it in &s;ome cau&s;es, by rea&s;on of <HI>Prejudice</HI> and <HI>In|tere&s;t</HI>: and it belongs to the Judge to con|&s;ider of this and not ra&s;hly to admit men to it indifferently, without enquiring into their capacity in tho&s;e regards. Some per|&s;ons are not of under&s;tanding &s;ufficient to know what they do when they Swear; &s;ome are lyars upon record; &s;ome have fore &s;talled them&s;elves by notorious prejudices, and &s;pecial malice; &s;ome are parties in the cau&s;e: and

<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> will &s;ee the Oath it &s;elf be &s;uch as the per&s;on is capable of.</HI> There be too many that are very forward and incon&s;iderate in offer|ing to Swear to &s;uch things, as in every wi&s;e mans Con&s;cience doth not come within the liberty of an Oath, and they &s;hould not Swear in truth and knowledge. A man may Swear to a matter of fact, becau&s;e he may have a through knowledge of it; but to Swear to the intention the per&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> that he &s;o &s;aid, or &s;o did, meaning thus or &s;o, is more than any man can with any &s;afety take an Oath to. A man may be <HI>morally certain</HI> of a thing, <HI>i. e.</HI> his rea&s;on may be abundantly &s;atisfied that it is &s;o, and yet he would be guilty of a ra&s;h, &s;inful and un|lawful Oath, if he &s;hould Swear to the Truth of it. Men &s;ometimes offer them&s;elves to Swear po&s;itively to a thing that it is &s;o, when, upon enquiry, it will be found, that they had it only upon hear &s;ay, from this or that hone&s;t body that told it them of their own knowledge, and they are very credible. The&s;e, and many &s;uch like things as the&s;e, are incident in Civil Judicatures, and are &s;ometimes urged with much importunity; but he who fears God, and fears an Oath, will be very &s;edulous in enquiring into &s;uch

circum&s;tances, before he will dare to admini|&s;ter an Oath to per&s;ons, becau&s;e of the high re&s;pect that he bears to the holy Name of God, which would hereby be expo&s;ed to be profaned.</P>
