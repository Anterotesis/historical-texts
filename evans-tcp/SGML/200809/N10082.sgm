<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE holine&s;s is, by the confe&s;&s;ion of all, the &s;um of all moral excellence, and the highe&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary at|tainment; it is of the la&s;t importance that we &s;hould well un|der&s;tand it's nature, and di&s;tingui&s;h it from all counterfeits. This will help us to under&s;tand the bible; to form right con|ceptions of the divine perfections, and di&s;tingui&s;h true reli|gion from that which is fal&s;e. Wrong conceptions of the di&s;tingui&s;hing nature of holine&s;s lead to all kinds of delu&s;ion in religion. And, on the other hand, ju&s;t &amp; clear apprehen|&s;ions of this are the be&s;t pre&s;ervative from fatal mi&s;takes; and have the happie&s;t tendency to remove the difference and oppo&s;ition in &s;entiments, and the &s;ad divi&s;ions, &s;o common a|mong profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians: And to bring them to '&s;peak the &s;ame thing, and be perfectly joined together in the &s;ame mind, and in the &s;ame judgment.'</P>
<P>The more I have attended to the religious controver&s;ies of this day, among us, the more have I been convinced that our different &s;entiments chiefly originate, either from too great inattention to the nature of holine&s;s, or very different appre|hen&s;ions about it: And that the real que&s;tion is, <HI>What is God's moral character?</HI> What is conformity to it? What oppo&s;es it? Were we agreed in this, mo&s;t of the&s;e di&s;putes would &s;ub&s;ide. In this view, they are far from being tri|fling, and de&s;erving that neglect and contempt, with which many affect to treat them. But appear intere&s;ting, important, and worthy the attention of all.</P>
<P>I humbly conceive there has been too little attention to the nature of holine&s;s, among divines in general; and that a pro|per and intelligible definition of it is not ea&s;ily to be found in bodies of divinity, or el&s;ewhere. And mo&s;t of tho&s;e who think it a very ea&s;y matter to tell what holine&s;s is, and
<PB N="iv" REF="012811_0004_0F8AC0054AFD0CA0">
that we are all agreed in this, have been contented with a &s;et of words, which expre&s;s no di&s;tinct ideas; but leave the thing wholly in the dark. They will perhaps &s;ay, <HI>God's holine&s;s is his purity.</HI> If it is a&s;ked, in what does this <HI>pu|rity</HI> con&s;i&s;t? The common an&s;wer is, <HI>in that which is oppo|&s;ite to all &s;in, the greate&s;t impurity.</HI> We have now got what, I think, is the mo&s;t common definition of holine&s;s. But who is the wi&s;er? This does not help us to any idea of this <HI>purity,</HI> unle&s;s we know what &s;in is. But this cannot be known, &s;o long as we know not what holine&s;s is: For we do not learn what holine&s;s is, by <HI>fir&s;t</HI> obtaining the idea of &s;in; but we mu&s;t fir&s;t know what holine&s;s, or, which is the &s;ame, what the divine law is, in order to the knowledge of &s;in.</P>
<P>Some have attempted to tell what holine&s;s is, by &s;aying, <HI>It is not properly a di&s;tinct attribute of God; but the beauty and glory of all God's moral perfections.</HI> But we get no idea by the&s;e words, till we are told <HI>what is this beauty and glory.</HI> To &s;ay, <HI>it is holine&s;s,</HI> is &s;aying nothing, or that which is no better.</P>
<P>Under a conviction of this too general inattention to the nature of holine&s;s&mdash;the great defect in the mo&s;t common de|&s;criptions of it&mdash;the importance of di&s;tinct and clear ideas of it&mdash;that the controver&s;ies before us turn chiefly upon this and will be decided the &s;horte&s;t and be&s;t way, by determining what holine&s;s is; I pre&s;ent to the public the following <HI>in|quiry;</HI> hoping it may give &s;ome light on the &s;ub|ject, and a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;uch as are willing to inquire into the nature of holine&s;s, as de&s;cribed in divine revelation: And in the light of this, help them to find on which &s;ide the truth lies, in the pre&s;ent controver&s;ies.</P>
<P>In this, however, I don't pretend to be an original. Pre|&s;ident <HI>EDWARDS,</HI> in his di&s;&s;ertation on the nature of true virtue, has given the &s;ame account of holine&s;s for &s;ub&s;tance, though under a different name, which the reader will find in the following inquiry. All I can pretend to, as an improve|ment on him, is to have explained &s;ome things more fully than he did; and more particularly &s;tated the oppo&s;ition of holi|ne&s;s
<PB N="v" REF="012811_0005_0F8AC0060ACBF638">
to &s;elf-love; and &s;hewn that this repre&s;entation of holi|ne&s;s is agreeable to the &s;cripture: And to have an&s;wered &s;ome objections he has not mentioned, and made a number of in|ferences.</P>
<P>As Mr. Hart had publi&s;hed objections again&s;t Mr. Ed|wards's account of the nature of true virtue, it &s;eemed nece&s;|&s;ary they &s;hould be con&s;idered and obviated. This I have done in an appendix, that what puts on the air of contro|ver&s;y might be by it&s;elf, and at the &s;ame time have the ad|vantage of the foregoing inquiry.</P>
<P>As Mr. Mather had publi&s;hed &s;omething re&s;pecting &s;elf-love, &amp;c. which appeared very contrary to the nature of holine&s;s; and on this ground objected to Mr. Edwards's ac-account of a holy ta&s;te, and to &s;ome things wrote by me; &s;ome brief remarks on him are &s;ubjoined, to detect the fallacy of his &s;cheme, and &s;hew that his objections are groundle&s;s. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Some remarks were al&s;o intended on what Mr. Dickin&s;on has pub|li&s;hed in &s;upport of the affirmative of the following que&s;tions.</P>
<Q><P><HI>I.</HI> Whether blindne&s;s of mind, is the primary cau&s;e of all wickedne&s;s, that there is in the hearts and lives of men?</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Whether the work of regeneration, is wrought in the &s;ouls of men, by the &s;upernatural influences of the holy &s;pirit, operating with the go&s;pel, whereby they are enlightened, and enables to know and love the truth as it is in Je&s;us?</P></Q>
<P>But as, on further con&s;ideration, it appeared probable that few would admit the extraordinary things he a&s;&s;erts in order to &s;up|port the&s;e propo&s;itions, viz That our fir&s;t parents, while perfectly holy, admitted the mo&s;t bla&s;phem us thought of God, and really believed them to be ju&s;t, which we &s;inners can hardly mention without horror, and that there was no &s;in in all this. P. <HI>12.</HI>&mdash; That the angels before they &s;inned, &amp; while they were perfectly fautle&s;s were blind, <HI>through their own fault,</HI> by &s;ome means of other.' P. <HI>14</HI> &mdash; That faith in Chri&s;t is the great duty that is commanded in the go&s;pel, and the fir&s;t act of obe|dience:' And yet mu&s;t take place before there is any change of heart, as the cau&s;e of all obedience.&mdash;And &s;ince he does not attempt to confute any thing I have &s;aid in &s;upport of the contrary; and all he &s;ays is really ob|viated in the inquiry and appendix: I have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the remarks pro|po&s;ed, to make room for an an&s;wer to Mr. Hemmenway, which &s;eemed of much more importance.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>When Mr. Hemmenway's vindication made its appear|ance, &s;everal rea&s;ons, the principal of which is mentioned in the introduction, induced me to an&s;wer him in an appendix: Whence the book exceeds the &s;ize at fir&s;t propo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="012811_0006_0F8AC006C955B1B8">However di&s;agreeable the&s;e di&s;putes are in them&s;elves, and offen&s;ive to many, I have the &s;atisfaction to think they have already been of great advantage to truth; and the plea&s;ure of believing they will yet be more &s;o, if protracted. When in this &s;en&s;e, <HI>many run to and fro, knowledge will be increa&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>There are tho&s;e, I know, who, in their own apprehen&s;ions, dwell in &s;uperior light, looking down with pity, if not re|&s;entment and contempt, upon tho&s;e concerned in the&s;e di&s;putes, as doing much mi&s;chief&mdash;contending in the dark about they know not what&mdash;di&s;puting about words, &amp;c. And are too wi&s;e &s;o much as to read any of the&s;e controver&s;ial wri|tings, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the happy talent of determining all the&s;e matters without any of this trouble, or much thought. We are willing &s;uch &s;hould know we do not envy their &s;upe|rior knowledge and wi&s;dom; and think they would not give le&s;s evidence of them, were they willing to be at the pains of <HI>hearing the matter,</HI> before they <HI>an&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P>The author wi&s;hes that peace, truth, and <HI>HOLINESS,</HI> may be promoted by the&s;e efforts: And that they may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, conduce to bring on the happy aera, when 'the knowledge of the glory of the Lord &s;hall fill the earth, as the waters cover the &s;ea': And 'there &s;hall be upon the bells of the hor&s;es, <HI>HOLINESS UNTO</HI> the LORD.'</P>
<P>May every reader remember, that whatever are his &s;pe|culations, and which &s;ide &s;oever of the di&s;puted que&s;tions he takes; yet <HI>without holine&s;s, no man &s;hall &s;ee the</HI> LORD. And let him who reads, and is in any mea&s;ure enlightened, and &s;trengthened in the way of holine&s;s, by what is now offer|ed to his peru&s;al, ble&s;s God, and give all the glory to <HI>HIM.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An INQUIRY into the Na|ture of TRUE HOLINESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> SOME general, introductory ob&s;ervations concerning the <HI>nature of true holine&s;s.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. HOLINESS is, in all re&s;pects, perfectly con&s;i&s;t|ent with right rea&s;on, and agreeable to its dic|tates: Or rea&s;on, properly exerci&s;ed and im|proved, will in all ca&s;es, and without fail, determine holine&s;s to be what it really is. However viti|ated the ta&s;te may be, and the heart di&s;reli&s;h, hate and oppo&s;e true holine&s;s, the &s;ame per&s;on's rea&s;on and judg|ment may pronounce it to be holine&s;s. Though the rea&s;on of man is liable to be blinded and prejudiced, by the vicious ta&s;te and reigning lu&s;ts of his heart, and often is &s;o to an amazing degree; yet it is not always and ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;o blinded; but may, and often does, dictate the truth in this matter; and always does, when rea&s;on is properly exerci&s;ed. Hence men of corrupt minds, ene|mies to holine&s;s in heart and practice, may rea&s;on well a|bout the nature of holine&s;s, and be able to prove what it con&s;i&s;ts in, by inconte&s;tible arguments. Hence the pro|priety
<PB N="2" REF="012811_0010_0F8AC009CE06AAF0">
of <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> on this &s;ubject. And we may be &s;ure that &s;o far as we rea&s;on right, and find what rea&s;on dic|tates, we have found the truth.</P>
<P N="2">II. Holine&s;s is that in which the highe&s;t enjoyment or happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts; and is really the greate&s;t good in the univer&s;e. It, in a &s;en&s;e and degree, puts us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all good. That therefore which gives true enjoyment, and tends to the highe&s;t, perfect, univer&s;al good of intel|ligent beings, is true holine&s;s; and nothing el&s;e can be worthy of that name.</P>
<P>It is true, that holine&s;s may be the occa&s;ion of mi&s;ery; and a perfectly holy being may not be perfectly happy, in certain peculiar circum&s;tances. As the imperfect holine&s;s of the &s;aints in this life, is the occa&s;ion of pain and di&s;tre&s;s of mind, which no unholy per&s;on can have: And Chri&s;t, in the human nature, though perfectly holy, was &s;ubject to great pain and &s;ufferings. But this is not properly owing to any thing in the nature and tendency of holine&s;s, but the peculiar circum&s;tances which attend it. There|fore tho&s;e exerci&s;es of mind which give a being the high|e&s;t enjoyment his nature is capable of, and put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all po&s;&s;ible good, and at the &s;ame time pro|mote the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the whole, is true holine&s;s. And tho&s;e exerci&s;es which have not this nature, but the contrary, are oppo&s;ed to holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. Holine&s;s is the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible excellence in the univer&s;e. It is that in which the highe&s;t and mo&s;t perfect beauty, and all real worth do &s;ummarily con&s;i&s;t. 'Tis in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e and degree the excellence and perfection of intelligent beings, that without it they have no real excel|lence, nor any true worth; but they are, in them&s;elves, odious, de&s;picable, and wor&s;e than nothing. The more they have of natural capacity, powers and endowments, if they have no holine&s;s, the further they are from all real excellence, and the more hateful; becau&s;e they, not being holy, are of cour&s;e more oppo&s;ed to holine&s;s, or have more of that which is moral evil, than beings of le&s;s natural ca|pacities could have.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="012811_0011_0F8AC00A86BEA388">If holine&s;s could be bani&s;hed from the univer&s;e, con&s;i|dered as comprehending Creator and creatures, and &s;hould actually cea&s;e, there would be no real excellence or worth in univer&s;al exi&s;tence: But it would be in truth infinitely wor&s;e than univer&s;al nothing. Holine&s;s is the beauty, ex|cellence, brightne&s;s, glory and perfection of God, by whatever name it is called. And this is true of all intel|ligent creatures. Therefore, if we can find what true mo|ral beauty, worth or excellence is, it will determine what is holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Holine&s;s is that by which intelligent beings are united together, in the highe&s;t, mo&s;t perfect and beautiful union. It con&s;i&s;ts in that harmony of affection, and uni|on of heart, by which the intelligent &s;y&s;tem becomes ONE, &s;o far as holine&s;s prevails; which fixes every being, by his own inclination and choice, in his proper place, &s;o as in the be&s;t manner to promote the good of the whole.&mdash; There is no moral beauty or happine&s;s among intelligent beings, without harmony and union of heart. All &s;in is oppo&s;ed to this; it &s;ets intelligences in oppo&s;ition to each other, and &s;preads the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable, unhappy di&s;cord. But holine&s;s unites them; it con&s;i&s;ts in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t excellent kind of union in nature. It is the mo&s;t ex|cellent and perfect bond, by which intelligent beings are, by their own voluntary exertions, united and cemented to|gether, in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t happy manner. If we can, with any degree of certainty then, determine what affection of heart that is, which thus unites intelligent be|ings, we may be equally certain that we have found the object of our inquiry, viz. true holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">V. Holine&s;s is e&s;&s;entially, in nature and kind, the &s;ame thing in all beings that are capable of it. Holine&s;s in God is not different, in nature and kind, from the holine&s;s of creatures. God's holine&s;s differs from the holine&s;s of creatures in degree, and in circum&s;tances, or in mode and form, agreeable to the infinite degree of his exi&s;tence, and the different manner and circum&s;tances in which he ex|i&s;ts;
<PB N="4" REF="012811_0012_0F8AC00CB2B02E58">
but is of the &s;ame nature, and &s;o e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame thing, in both. We have the greate&s;t certainty of this, in that holine&s;s in the creature is, in &s;cripture, called the i|mage of God, and that by which they partake of the divine nature; and is repre&s;ented to be the holy &s;pirit of God, or God's holine&s;s, dwelling and acting in them; by which God dwells in them, and they dwell in God.</P>
<P>Holine&s;s in different creatures may al&s;o differ in &s;ome circum&s;tances, and in the particular form and manner of its exerci&s;es, owing to their very different &s;tate, relations and circum&s;tances. Thus, the holine&s;s of creatures, who never have &s;inned, is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, as to the form and manner of its excerci&s;es, different from the holine&s;s of tho&s;e who have &s;inned, and being redeemed by Chri&s;t, are re|covered to holine&s;s. And in this lies the difference be|tween what is called legal holine&s;s, and evangelical holine&s;s; the former being the holine&s;s of angels, and of man before he &s;inned; the latter is the holine&s;s of tho&s;e who are re|deemed from among men. This difference might ea&s;ily be pointed out; but this will not be attempted here, as we are inquiring into the general nature of true holine&s;s. This, I &s;ay, is the &s;ame in all creatures; and therefore has but one and the &s;ame rule, the law of God, and con&s;i&s;ts in conformity to that.</P>
<P>Therefore, if we can find what is the nature of divine holine&s;s, we may be certain that we have found what is the holine&s;s of creatures; and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> This there|fore mu&s;t be kept in mind, as what may be of u&s;e in our inquiry.</P>
<P N="6">VI. True holine&s;s is in its own nature one &s;imple, un|compounded thing. It is not made up of different and various kinds of exerci&s;es, properties and ingredients, which may exi&s;t di&s;tinct and &s;eparate, or in any degree in|dependent of each other, and being put together make one compound: But, in oppo&s;ition to this, is perfectly &s;im|ple and uncompounded.</P>
<P>This is mo&s;t certainly true of the divine holine&s;s. And
<PB N="5" REF="012811_0013_0F8AC00CD83F4E50">
if holine&s;s in creatures is of the &s;ame nature and kind, being a participation of the divine nature, and con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;pirit of God imparted to the &s;oul, &amp; dwelling in it, which is the &s;criptural repre&s;entation of the matter, as has been ob&s;erved; then this mu&s;t be true of creature holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Holine&s;s is in &s;cripture called life: It is indeed the high|e&s;t and mo&s;t perfect kind of life. Now life is one &s;imple thing: It is not compounded of different things, and made up of various parts, which differ in nature and kind, and do not imply &amp; involve the whole. This may re|ceive &s;ome illu&s;tration, perhaps, from animal life. This, as it appears in exerci&s;es towards different objects, in vari|ous circum&s;tances, and by different &s;en&s;es, &s;ight, ta&s;te, hearing, &amp;c. is called by different names; but it is the &s;ame &s;imple, uncompounded thing in its nature, and in all its exerci&s;es: It is the &s;ame animal life, in whatever form or name it appears. Every property and motion, is the motion and property of this &s;ame life, and implies the whole. So holine&s;s, though it has obtained different names, as it is exerci&s;ed in different circum&s;tances, and towards different objects, is the &s;ame mo&s;t &s;imple, undi|vided &s;piritual life. This remark may be of u&s;e in the inquiry we are entering upon. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">It has been &s;aid, that
<Q>virtue is a complex thing: It does not primarily con&s;i&s;t in one &s;ingle di&s;po&s;ition, tendency or affection of mind, all other affections ri&s;ing out of that as their root; but in|cludes various affections, equally original and e&s;&s;ential to virtue.</Q>
But not the lea&s;t probable evidence of this a&s;&s;ertion has been offered, or even attempted, &s;o far as I have ob&s;erved. See Mr. <HI>Hart</HI>'s remarks on pre&s;ident Edwards, p. 40, 41.</NOTE></P>
<P N="7">VII. The nature and di&s;tingui&s;hing properties of true holine&s;s are &s;o clearly de&s;cribed in the holy &s;criptures, that nothing is needed but to under&s;tand the mo&s;t important truths revealed there, in order to know what true holine&s;s is, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from all counterfeits. It is one chief end of divine revelation to make known and a&s;certain the di&s;tingui&s;hing nature of true holine&s;s. The great end of divine revelation is to make known the true God to man, and manife&s;t his glory; e&s;pecially to reveal his moral per|fections,
<PB N="6" REF="012811_0014_0F8AC00DBA93C5F8">
which is his glory. And this is the &s;ame with his holine&s;s; for this is all the moral perfection in the u|niver&s;e. And &s;o far as the bible reveals the duty and hap|pine&s;s of man, which is doubtle&s;s done with all po&s;&s;ible clearne&s;s, and in the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t manner, ju&s;t &s;o far is the nature of true holine&s;s revealed; for in this both the duty and happine&s;s of man con&s;i&s;t. Therefore he only under&s;tands his bible, who has learned what is true holi|ne&s;s: And he who is ignorant of the nature and proper|ties of this, is blind to the mo&s;t leading, important things contained in divine revelation. He knows not God; he is ignorant of the divine law, and the go&s;pel; of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his own true intere&s;t. The bible is indeed a &s;ealed book to him, and he is in darkne&s;s even until now. But he who has a true idea of holine&s;s, knoweth him who is holy in all his works: He under&s;tands the go&s;pel, and walketh in the light. This at once &s;hews how important the inquiry is which we are entering upon; and the great help we may expect from the bible, in determining this que&s;tion; and con&s;equently, the rea&s;onablene&s;s and im|portance of attending con&s;tantly to that, in all our inqui|ries of this nature.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations, being kept in view, will greatly help us in our inquiry into the nature of true holine&s;s, and &s;erve as land-marks to direct us. If rea&s;on, when pro|perly improved will direct us to it&mdash;If it is that alone in which true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, and which tends to the greate&s;t general good&mdash;If it is the highe&s;t, the &s;upreme beauty and excellence; that in which all the real worth of intelligences con&s;i&s;ts, and without which the intellectu|al, moral world would be infinitely wor&s;e than nothing&mdash; If it unites intelligent beings together, in the mo&s;t amia|ble, happy manner and degree; and is the only bond of &s;uch union&mdash;If it is, in its nature, one &s;imple thing; &s;o that if we can find what is any one thing which comes into the nature of holine&s;s; or any thing which is properly a branch of holine&s;s, we have found, in that, every thing e&s;|&s;ential.
<PB N="7" REF="012811_0015_0F8AC00FBB751D78">
&mdash;If holine&s;s is the &s;ame in nature and kind, in whatever being it is found&mdash;If one chief de&s;ign of divine revelation is to teach us what holine&s;s is, and it is from the beginning to the end of the bible held up to view in the mo&s;t clear and intelligible manner, in the be&s;t way to give us a true idea of it, as it &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;hed from every thing el&s;e; &s;o that he who runs may read it <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See I&s;aiah xxxv. 8.</NOTE>&mdash;If all this is true, then &s;urely nothing can be more certainly, and with greater ca&s;e determined, than the que&s;tion before us; as we may be &s;ure, on the one hand, that what&s;oever does not agree to all the&s;e, is not true holine&s;s, however it may &s;eem to agree to &s;ome: And on the other hand, that which is found to bear all the&s;e marks, has the divine &s;tamp, and may be &s;afely fixed upon, without any further re&s;earches.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Wherein it is &s;hewed that holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>THE law of God is the &s;tandard of all moral recti|tude, or holine&s;s. Holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in conformity to this, and in nothing el&s;e: Therefore the knowlege of the precepts of the moral law, decides the que&s;tion before us; for whatever the holy law of God requires is holine&s;s, and nothing el&s;e can de&s;erve the name. Our divine teach|er has, in his great wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, given us a &s;um|mary of the divine law, in the following words:
<Q>Thou &s;halt LOVE the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind. This is the fir&s;t and great commandment. And the &s;econd is like unto it. Thou &s;halt LOVE thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. Upon the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</Q>
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxii. 37, 38, 39, 40.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012811_0016_0F8AC00FDFB5A148">Here all obedience to the law of God is reduced to one thing, LOVE; love to God and our neighbour, in|cluding our&s;elves; this is the whole that is required. Therefore this is the whole of true holine&s;s; it con&s;i&s;ts in this love, and in nothing el&s;e. When Chri&s;t &s;ays, 'on the&s;e two commandments <HI>hang</HI> all the law and the pro|phets,' he mu&s;t be under&s;tood to a&s;&s;ert, that the whole of the law and the prophets, all that is required in them, is <HI>love.</HI> All depends upon this; &s;o that if love is removed, all that is required is removed; the law &amp; the prophets come to nothing, and fall to the ground. Take love away, and there is nothing left that is required in the whole of divine revelation. If love was not the whole that the law re|quires, it could not be &s;aid to be wholly <HI>&s;u&s;pended</HI> on this, &s;o as utterly to fall, if love is excluded: For the law would &s;till exi&s;t, as there would be yet &s;omething com|manded.</P>
<P>But if there could be any doubt about the meaning of the&s;e words of our &s;aviour, St. Paul has explained them, when he &s;ays, 'LOVE is the fulfilling of the law; for <HI>all</HI> the law is fulfilled in <HI>one word,</HI> even in this; thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.' If <HI>all</HI> the law is fulfilled in love, then this is all that the law requires; for the law is not fulfilled, unle&s;s the whole is given which it requires. Therefore love is the whole of that obedience which the law requires. Perfect, &s;upreme love to God, and that love to our neighbour which is implied in it, i. e. loving him as our&s;elves: This LOVE expre&s;&s;ed in all proper ways, which is implied in its being perfect, is the fulfill|ing of the law; this is true holine&s;s. Therefore the love of God, and keeping his commandments is &s;poken of as one thing: 'For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.' <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. v. 3.</NOTE> This could not be, if there was any obedience or holine&s;s, which is not love; or there was any command which required any thing le&s;s or more than love.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 10.

<P><PB N="9" REF="012811_0017_0F8AC01091F50BC0">Thus far then we go on &s;ure ground, and have the greate&s;t certainty that holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in LOVE. And all the difficulty in the que&s;tion before us is in determining what is meant by love; what is the nature and kind of that love which the law requireth. This will be parti|cularly attended to in the following &s;ection.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> Wherein it is inquired what that love is, in which all true holine&s;s con&s;i&s;teth.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH 'tis certain from the holy &s;criptures that all true holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in love; yet all love is not holine&s;s. If it were, then all men would be holy, and have a great degree of holine&s;s; for we all exerci&s;e much love, even in all our volitions and conduct. But it is &s;o far from being true, that all kinds of love, and love to all objects is holine&s;s, that there is a &s;inful love often &s;poken of in &s;cripture. Such is the love of them that hate the Lord; <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xix. 2.</NOTE> The love of the world; <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. ii. 15.</NOTE> and love of our own &s;elves. <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 2.</NOTE> There is a kind of love therefore which is in its nature contrary to holine&s;s. Of this the world has been full in all ages. It is nece&s;&s;ary therefore that we &s;hould carefully inquire into the nature and kind of holy love, in order to find the true and proper di&s;tinc|tion and difference between that, and the love in which there is no holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Love has been u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed into love of bene|volence or good will; love of complacence or delight; love of e&s;teem&mdash;and love of gratitude. The love of benevolence is good-will to beings capable of good or happine&s;s, and con&s;i&s;ts in de&s;iring and pur&s;uing their good, or rejoicing in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it. By benevo|lence
<PB N="10" REF="012811_0018_0F8AC016B34D6470">
is, I &s;uppo&s;e, mo&s;t commonly meant, that good-will which is exerci&s;ed towards other beings, in di&s;tinction from &s;elf-love: But good will is as really implied in &s;elf-love, as in the love of others; for they who love them|&s;elves only, exerci&s;e good will towards them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Complacence is that affection of the mind in which we are plea&s;ed with any object. There is what may be called complacence in benevolence it&s;elf, even in all the exerci&s;es of it; being nece&s;&s;arily implied in it. Good-will to any being, &s;uppo&s;es a ta&s;te for good and happi|ne&s;s, &amp; that we have &s;ome good in view, with which we are plea&s;ed. If any one wi&s;hes well to him&s;elf only, this is taking delight in &s;ome good, <HI>as his own.</HI> And wi&s;hing well to others, implies a ta&s;te and reli&s;h for the good of others, <HI>as theirs,</HI> and a delight in it, when they are &s;een po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it.</P>
<P>But by the love of complacence, when di&s;tingui&s;hed from benevolence, is, I think, generally meant, the plea|&s;ure and delight we take in the per&s;on and character of an intelligent being, as beautiful and excellent. In this &s;en&s;e the word will be u&s;ed in this di&s;cour&s;e. And, com|placence being under&s;tood in this &s;en&s;e, it may be ob&s;erv|ed, that benevolence and complacence have not always the &s;ame object. We may exerci&s;e good will to a per&s;on who&s;e whole character is very di&s;agreeable and di&s;plea&s;ing to us; &s;o that he may, at the &s;ame time, be the object of our benevolence and of our di&s;plicence and aver&s;ion; becau&s;e, though capable of happine&s;s, his pre&s;ent charac|ter is di&s;agreeable and hateful.</P>
<P>The love of e&s;teem is nothing di&s;tinct from benevo|lence and complacence, exerci&s;ed towards a worthy, ex|cellent object, at lea&s;t in our apprehen&s;ion. The love of gratitude is that affection which we exerci&s;e towards ano|ther, con&s;idered as a benefactor, for his good will exerci&s;ed towards our&s;elves, or others. This includes in it both benevolence and complacence, and is nothing di&s;tinct from this, as might be ea&s;ily &s;hewn, was there need of it;
<PB N="11" REF="012811_0019_0F8AC018C834FB90">
and will perhaps be mere particularly attended to in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Having ob&s;erved the&s;e things concerning love in gene|ral, it now remains to be &s;aid, what that love is in which holine&s;s con&s;i&s;teth. This is love to God and our neigh|bour, including our&s;elves; and is univer&s;al benevolence, or friendly affection to all intelligent beings. This uni|ver&s;al benevolence, with all that affection or love which is included in it, and in&s;eparable from it, is the holy love which God's law requires, and is the whole of true holi|ne&s;s. This love is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other kinds of love, both in its nature, and object. The object is,</P>
<P N="1">1. Univer&s;al being, including God and all intelligent creatures. Benevolence, or univer&s;al goodne&s;s, has for its object all beings which exi&s;t, capable of good, or that can be, in any &s;en&s;e and degree, objects of good will. Any kind of good will, or any thing which has the ap|pearance of benevolence, which is limited to particular objects, and will not extend to all towards which good will can be exerci&s;ed, is not <HI>univer&s;al</HI> benevolence; but is e&s;&s;entially different from it, and quite of another na|ture. That good will, which will extend only to a limit|ed number, or a certain kind or circle of beings, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, is not univer&s;al good will: It falls, as it were, infinitely &s;hort of it, in this re&s;pect, and is &s;o far from uniting its &s;ubject to univer&s;al exi&s;tence, that it is circum&s;cribed by very narrow bounds, and is con&s;i&s;tent with ill will and oppo&s;ition to general exi&s;tence; yea, it is in fact in its own nature &s;uch: For it &s;ets up an infinitely &s;mall part of exi&s;tence, compared with the whole, and re|gards it above the whole; which has the nature of un|friendly di&s;regard, and real oppo&s;ition to the whole. It hence appears to be &s;o far from true univer&s;al benevo|lence, that it is of an oppo&s;ite nature; as it does <HI>from its nature</HI> oppo&s;e it. Be&s;ides, it is certain that &s;uch limit|ed good will has nothing of the nature of univer&s;al good|ne&s;s, but it is &s;omething <HI>in its own nature</HI> which thus li|mits
<PB N="12" REF="012811_0020_0F8AC0198BAE3048">
it to a &s;mall part of being, in oppo&s;ition to being in general, as there can be no other rea&s;on of this limitation, but the nature of the affection it&s;elf: Which could not be, if it was not <HI>in nature</HI> different from univer&s;al benevo|lence, and contrary to it. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Edwards has &s;et this in a clear light, in his di&s;&s;ertation concerning the nature of true virtue, p. 129, 130, 131.</P>
<P>And this view of the matter &s;hews us in what &s;en&s;e univer&s;al exi&s;t|ence is the <HI>primary</HI> object of holy benevolence. This is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential thing in it, in which lies its di&s;tinction from all love which is not holy. This is the leading, governing thing in it, as that in which its peculiar di&s;hingui&s;hing nature con&s;i&s;ts. He who exerci&s;es true benevolence towards any particular being, does it as a friend to the whole; &s;o that his love to him is really love to being in general, as he belongs to the whole, and is included in it.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>But holy love unites the heart to univer&s;al exi&s;tence, &s;o far as it comes into view, and is the mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip to all without exception; and wi&s;hes and &s;eeks the good of every individual, &s;o far as this is con&s;i&s;tent with the great|e&s;t good of being in general; except tho&s;e who are known implacable enemies to general exi&s;tence. And the&s;e are nece&s;&s;arily oppo&s;ed by this univer&s;al benevolence.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another object of univer&s;al benevolence is <HI>the high|e&s;t good of the whole.</HI> As &s;oon and as far as the eyes of the benevolent per&s;on are opened to &s;ee what is the true good of intelligent beings, and highe&s;t happine&s;s of the univer&s;e, this good becomes the object of his wi&s;hes. And as holine&s;s it&s;elf is this true and highe&s;t good, even holy love and benevolence, by which intelligences are united together in the mo&s;t beautiful, happy manner, every one to his utmo&s;t con&s;piring to promote the greate&s;t general good, and enjoying this good: I &s;ay, as this is the highe&s;t good, it becomes the object of his delight, and of his wi&s;hes; &s;o that this is the object of his benevolence, and of his complacence at the &s;ame time. And in this al&s;o ho|ly love is di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other kind of love, as that has not holine&s;s for its object in any &s;en&s;e or degree, but is con&s;i&s;tent with the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion to it. And this
<PB N="13" REF="012811_0021_0F8AC01A4EF8A058">
holy love differs from all other kinds of love in its <HI>nature,</HI> as well as object. The nature of it may be determined by its object. That affection who&s;e object not only dif|fers in nature and kind from the object of other love, but is oppo&s;ite to it, mu&s;t it&s;elf be of a different and oppo&s;ite nature. But the particular nature of this love will be more fully explained hereafter.</P>
<P>This univer&s;al benevolence, or love to being in gene|ral, mu&s;t have God, who is infinitely the greate&s;t and mo&s;t excellent, and the &s;um of all being and perfection, for its object, and is exerci&s;ed towards him, in loving him with all the heart, with all the &s;oul, with all the mind, and with all the &s;trength. This is, I think, well expre&s;&s;ed by Mr. EDWARDS, in the following words:
<Q>The mind being under the &s;ovran dominion of <HI>love to God,</HI> does, above all things, &s;eek the glory of God, and make this his &s;upreme, governing, and ultimate end; con&s;i&s;ting in the expre&s;&s;ion of God's perfections in their proper ef|fects, and in the communications of the infinite fulne&s;s of God to the creature; in the creature's highe&s;t e&s;teem of God, love to God, and joy in God, and in the pro|per exerci&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e.&mdash;And as far as &s;uch a mind exerci&s;es benevolence to created beings, it chiefly &s;eeks the good of the creature, con&s;i&s;ting in its knowlege or view of God's glory and beauty, its union with God, conformity and love to him, and joy in him. And that temper or di&s;po&s;ition of heart, that con&s;ent, union, or propen&s;ity of mind to being in general, which appears chiefly in &s;uch exerci&s;es, is real holine&s;s. And no other affection but this is of the nature of true virtue.</Q>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Nature of true virtue, p. 133.</NOTE></P>
<P>But it will be proper here more particularly to &s;hew, that all holy affection con&s;i&s;ts in this benevolence or goodne&s;s; and that it can con&s;i&s;t in nothing but this, and what is implied in it. This will be evident, if the two following propo&s;itions can be &s;upported.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="012811_0022_0F8AC01B10BEC610">1. Univer&s;al benevolence does imply love of compla|cence, and all holy love. He who exerci&s;es univer&s;al be|nevolence does e&s;teem and take complacency in all, ac|cording to their worth and excellence: For not to do &s;o is unkind and injurious, and therefore contrary to the na|ture of benevolence. And benevolent affection, from the nece&s;&s;ity of its nature, is plea&s;ed with this &s;ame affection in others. Every one mu&s;t be plea&s;ed with friend&s;hip to tho&s;e to whom he him&s;elf is a friend; for not to be &s;o, would be a contradiction.</P>
<P>Benevolent, kind affection nece&s;&s;arily implies al&s;o gra|titude to benefactors for kindne&s;s exerci&s;ed; for this is nothing el&s;e but being properly affected with the benevo|lence of others, which has ju&s;t been &s;hewn to be the na|ture of benevolence. Be&s;ides, not to exerci&s;e gratitude to|wards the benevolent and kind, is it&s;elf unkind; and therefore contrary to the nature of benevolence. A man mu&s;t be &s;tripped of all true benevolence, in order to ex|clude gratitude: Where the former is, the latter is found to an equal degree.&mdash;Thus evident is it, that all holy love is implied in univer&s;al benevolence; &s;o that he who has this, certainly has the whole. To &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on truly benevolent, &amp; not to exerci&s;e holy love of e&s;teem, compla|cence &amp; gratitude, in all &s;uitable ways, &amp; towards all pro|per objects, is a mo&s;t glaring contradiction, and to ima|gine a character which never did, nor can exi&s;t,</P>
<P N="2">2. On the contrary, where there is no holy love of be|nevolence, there can be no holy love of any kind. Since benevolence nece&s;&s;arily includes all holy love, in its very nature; where this is not, there is not, there cannot be, any holy love.</P>
<P>The love of gratitude &s;uppo&s;es benevolence, and is re|ally an exerci&s;e of this. Gratitude is certainly an appro|bation of benevolence, which never takes place in a mind de&s;titute of it. And what is gratitude but an exerci&s;e of friendly affection towards the benevolent? So certain is it that where there is no good will, there is no true gra|titude.
<PB N="15" REF="012811_0023_0F8AC01BCB49A218">
This is &s;o evident at fir&s;t thought, that 'tis need|le&s;s to enlarge.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall be more particular in producing evidence that there can be no holy love of complacence, where there is no benevolence. Holy complacence is the love of holine&s;s for holine&s;s &s;ake; or the approbation of a holy character, for its intrin&s;ic beauty and excellence. That there can be no holy complacence, independent of benevolence, is evident from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>The mind cannot have any holy complacence in uni|ver&s;al goodne&s;s, while it&s;elf is wholly de&s;titute of it. The mind which is wholly devoid of kind affection, has no true, &s;en&s;ible idea of benevolence, and con&s;equently can have no delight in it. Delight or complacence is a <HI>&s;en&s;a|tion</HI> of the mind, which cannot be exerci&s;ed towards that object of which it has no true &s;en&s;e; but the mind which has no benevolence, has no &s;en&s;ation of it; for &s;uch a &s;en&s;ation implies benevolence; and therefore can have no complacence in it. As the love of holine&s;s, is an ex|erci&s;e of holine&s;s; &s;o the love of holy benevolence, im|plies the exerci&s;e of benevolence. Therefore he who hath no benevolence, hath no complacence in it.&mdash;But that affection of the mind which is not the love of <HI>all</HI> ho|line&s;s, in whatever it may con&s;i&s;t, is not a true holy com|placence; but &s;omething of a different nature. There|fore there can be no holy complacence in holine&s;s, with|out the exerci&s;e of benevolence: Con&s;equently where there is no benevolence, there is no holy exerci&s;e of mind.</P>
<P>But this will be more evident, if po&s;&s;ible, by con&s;ider|ing the love of complacence, as exerci&s;ed towards God. It will appear, on due con&s;ideration, that the per&s;on who has no univer&s;al benevolence, does not heartily approve of the benevolence of God; and therefore does not de|light in God's holine&s;s or moral character, &s;o far as it con|&s;i&s;ts in benevolence.&mdash;But he who is not a friend to the ho|ly benevolence of God, is certainly not a friend to holine&s;s in general, and &s;o has no complacency in any true holi|ne&s;s.
<PB N="16" REF="012811_0024_0F8AC01C901BDEF0">
Yea, he who has no benevolence in his heart, is an enemy to benevolence: For the heart of man is in no &s;uch in&s;tance indifferent, neither friendly, nor oppo&s;ed to any thing in God's moral character; is never in &s;uch a &s;tate, as neither to approve nor di&s;approve. Therefore &s;uch an one is an enemy to univer&s;al benevolence in God: Whence it follows that he has no true love to God's mo|ral character. For he who is di&s;plea&s;ed with any thing in the moral character of God, is certainly di&s;plea&s;ed with the whole, as the holine&s;s of God is not incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf; but is one mo&s;t &s;imple thing.</P>
<P>The holine&s;s of God, which is expre&s;&s;ed in his law, and in the go&s;pel (for the &s;ame character and the &s;ame holine&s;s is expre&s;&s;ed in both) con&s;i&s;ts, in a great mea&s;ure at lea&s;t, in &s;uch &s;upreme regard to him&s;elf, and the high|e&s;t happine&s;s and glory of his kingdom, that he holds every one who oppo&s;es him and his kingdom, or has the lea&s;t di&s;re&s;pect, or even indifference towards him and his glory, ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to eternal damnation; and is di&s;po&s;ed to inflict it on all &s;uch who cannot be delivered from it, con|&s;i&s;tent with his own highe&s;t honor, and the greate&s;t good of the whole.</P>
<P>Now, it is in the nature of things impo&s;&s;ible, that he who has no regard to God and his glory, and no univer&s;al good-will, &s;hould in the lea&s;t approve of &s;uch a character. Yea, he mu&s;t be at enmity with it, as there is no medium. He who is not for it, is again&s;t it. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The mind thus e&s;tranged from univer&s;al good will, is 'The car|nal mind, which is enmity again&s;t God." Rom. viii. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>This will appear &s;till more glaring, by ob&s;erving, what will be more particularly con&s;idered hereafter, that the holy love of God, which is mo&s;t celebrated in the divine oracles, as worthy of our love and imitation, is the love of benevolence, which God exerci&s;es and manife&s;ts towards fallen man, who has become his enemy. This is certain|ly a love, not of complacence, but of benevolence, as all love to enemies mu&s;t be. Now he who has not that be|nevolence
<PB N="17" REF="012811_0025_0F8AC01D486D0B20">
which di&s;po&s;es him to love his enemies, will not be plea&s;ed with this love of God; but di&s;plea&s;ed. He who has no love to his enemies, but cheri&s;hes the con|trary affection, will not be plea&s;ed with that good will which is equally extended to his enemies, and to him&s;elf; but &s;uch love mu&s;t be the object of his aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus evident is it, that they who have no benevolence, do not approve of God's holine&s;s or moral character, re|vealed in his word; &s;ince univer&s;al benevolence mu&s;t be the object, not of their delight, but of their aver&s;ion: And con&s;equently, that the holy love of complacence cannot exi&s;t independent of benevolence; which was the point to be proved. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Hart &s;ays, men are drawn to God 'by his giving them to feel in them&s;elves his attracting love and virtue, and paternal benevo|lence and propen&s;ity of heart towards them; by a realizing belief of which, their hearts are put in motion towards him, that all true vir|tue, and virtuous love begins thus.' That this being 'perceived, re|alized, and felt, as extended to them, is the true cau&s;e, ground and &s;ource of the fir&s;t exi&s;tence of &s;uch a thing in them as a truly virtuous propen&s;ity of heart to him,' (remarks on pre&s;ident Edwards, p. 23, 24.)</P>
<P>Upon this it may be ob&s;erved, that the love of God, which Mr. Hart here &s;peaks of, is the love of benevolence, God's paternal bene|volence.' It is the love of benevolence, not only as it is love to ene|mies; but as it is love and grace, in and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; in which God is repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t clear and &s;triking light, as hav|ing &s;uch a regard to him&s;elf and the general good (which is nothing but univer&s;al benevolence) that he will not &s;hew any favour to &s;inners, unle&s;s his glory and the general good be effectually &s;ecured by Chri&s;t the mediator. And he who &s;ees not God's grace and love to men in this light, knows not what is the grace of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There|fore the &s;en&s;e of this love of God, in which their hearts are drawn to him, is it&s;elf of the nature of benevolence, and the exerci&s;e of it: For, as has been &s;hewn, it is impo&s;&s;ible that be who has no holy bene|volence, &s;hould heartily approve of &s;uch benevolence, and take plea|&s;ure in it. Therefore, according to Mr. H. the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of holi|ne&s;s in men cannot be an exerci&s;e of love, in which there is no benevo|lence; but this mu&s;t be the very e&s;&s;ence of the fir&s;t holy act, in which the &s;oul is attracted to God, as the fountain and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of benevolence, or univer&s;al goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>If Mr. H. will &s;hew how a &s;inner, while wholly de&s;titute of bene|volence, and wholly inclined to contrary exerci&s;es, can feel the attract|ing influence of God's benevolence; and take complacence in his univer&s;al goodne&s;s; and, under this attracting influence, return to God, and become his true friend, without any good-will to God, or any other being: We will then grant that univer&s;al benevolence is not nece&s;&s;arily implied in the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> nor in any &s;ub&s;equent motion of the &s;inner's heart towards God, and his neighbour.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that when &s;inners have a realizing belief of God's 'paternal benevolence and propen&s;ity of heart towards them,' they do not con&s;ider it as univer&s;al benevolence; but only as love <HI>to them&s;elves</HI> in particular, and that this attracts their hearts to God, while yet they have no approbation of general benevolence, or the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of it:&mdash;Upon this I would ob&s;erve, that this may be Mr. H.'s meaning, and he may expre&s;s him&s;elf thus, through inat|tention to the true notion of general benevolence, as many doubtle&s;s have done. But if the matter is viewed in this light, there is nothing of the nature of holine&s;s in the attraction of their hearts to God, meerly becau&s;e they think he loves them. As they may exerci&s;e this love without any benevolence, &s;o they may, and mu&s;t do it, without the lea&s;t degree of holine&s;s. It has been &s;hewn that this is not a true fight and belief of the love of God; and it will appear, I hope, in the &s;equel, that this has nothing of the nature of holine&s;s; but is con&s;i&s;t|ent with the reigning power of every lu&s;t. I &s;hall <HI>here</HI> only take no|tice of the mo&s;t expre&s;s deci&s;ion of our &s;aviour him&s;elf. 'If ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? For &s;inners love tho&s;e that love them.' (Luk. vi. 32.) Men may be ea&s;ily converted upon this plan, without having new hearts given them, or any change of heart for the better. They want this light only, i. e. a belief that God loves them (which is not light indeed, but delu&s;ion) and they will love him, in this view, and on this ground only, without any di&s;|po&s;ition to love their enemies, and con&s;i&s;tent with their continuing to hate the holine&s;s of God.</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IV.</HI> Wherein &s;elf-love is &s;hewn to be no part of that love in which holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts; but of a nature quite different and oppo&s;ite.</HEAD>
<P>SELF-LOVE has been repre&s;ented by many, not only as a branch of holine&s;s; but that in which it ra|dically con&s;i&s;ts, making it the &s;pring of all our actions. Some have thought it not only no part of holine&s;s, but oppo&s;ed to it. Others have taken a medium between the&s;e two, &amp; repre&s;ented &s;elf-love to be in its nature inno|cent and good; but not holy love, unle&s;s love to God and our neighbour be joined with it, to regulate and govern it.&mdash;In order to determine which of the&s;e opinions is right, we mu&s;t under&s;tand what is intended by &s;elf-love. By this very different things are meant by different, and of|ten by the &s;ame per&s;ons. There are three things e&s;pe|cially, often called by that name, and their not being di&s;|tingui&s;hed, has occa&s;ioned great confu&s;ion and error in treating this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> A general appetite to good, and aver&s;ion to evil, con&s;idered meerly as &s;uch, or a perception of pain or plea&s;ure, is called &s;elf love. This is e&s;&s;ential to all moral agents, being implied in every act of will. If nothing was good or evil to us, we could have no choice or pow|er of will, more than a tree or rock; for by the &s;uppo&s;i|tion we &s;hould be perfectly indifferent to every thing We could neither love nor hate, choo&s;e nor refu&s;e. This general appetite is therefore common to all moral agents, holy and &s;inful, and is e&s;&s;ential to every act, both of &s;in and holine&s;s. It is properly a natural capacity; as much &s;o as the faculty of under&s;tanding, or power of will; and is the very &s;ame thing, indeed, with the latter, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="012811_0028_0F8AC01F8919E908">
implied in it. It is therefore, in it&s;elf, neither &s;inful nor holy; but a foundation or capacity for either. Should this cea&s;e in angels and devils, they would no longer be holy or &s;inful.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> By &s;elf-love is &s;ometimes meant <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> or tho&s;e exerci&s;es in which a per&s;on loves him&s;elf only, which wholly confine him to his own per&s;onal intere&s;t; he taking no plea&s;ure in any thing el&s;e, but placing all his good and happine&s;s here. This is mo&s;t properly called &s;elf-love; as it is a man's love of his own &s;elf <HI>as &s;elf,</HI> and of nothing el&s;e; and therefore is oppo&s;ed to the love of others, or univer&s;al benevolence. This is wholly an intere&s;ted, &s;elfi&s;h affection, by which a per&s;on &s;ets up him&s;elf as &s;upreme, and the only object of regard; and nothing is good or lovely in his view, unle&s;s it coincide with his &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and be &s;uited to promote his own pri|vate intere&s;t: All other beings are by him &s;ubordinated to him&s;elf, and loved for his own &s;ake only; and &s;o far as they oppo&s;e, or do not &s;erve this contracted, partial in|tere&s;t, in which he places all his good and happine&s;s, are either hated, or totally di&s;regarded.&mdash;In a word, the di&s;|po&s;ition and language of his heart is,
<Q>There is nothing in the whole univer&s;e of any worth to me, but my own &s;elf; if I may be happy, it is enough.</Q>
There is no need of any laboured proof to &s;hew that &s;uch exerci&s;es of heart are, in their nature, oppo&s;ition to univer&s;al good-will: This appears at fir&s;t view. Therefore, if the latter has any thing of the nature of holine&s;s, the former mu&s;t &s;tand directly oppo&s;ed to it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> By &s;elf-love may be under&s;tood the love a per&s;on has for him&s;elf as part of the whole, which is implied in univer&s;al benevolence. He who loves the whole, loves every part of the whole; therefore mu&s;t love him&s;elf, and &s;eek his own happine&s;s, as he is included in general being. 'Tis a contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e that a per&s;on has univer&s;al good-will, and yet has no regard to him&s;elf.
<PB N="21" REF="012811_0029_0F8AC020479A74F8">
This love of our&s;elves is therefore nece&s;&s;arily implied in that univer&s;al benevolence which is oppo&s;ed to the &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s de&s;cribed above. That is altogether &s;elfi&s;h, con|&s;i&s;ting in a man's loving him&s;elf, <HI>as &s;elf,</HI> or meerly becau&s;e he is him&s;elf, but this love of him&s;elf of which I am now &s;peaking, is not love of &s;elf, <HI>as &s;elf,</HI> but as implied in the general object of love; and therefore is no other than love, love to being in general, or univer&s;al benevo|lence. It is the &s;ame kind of affection with which he loves his neighbour; in loving his neighbour, he loves him&s;elf al&s;o, becau&s;e he cannot love his neighbour as part of the whole, and not love him&s;elf al&s;o as &s;uch; his own happine&s;s, as an individual, being worth as much in it&s;elf, and to the whole, as that of his neighbour, and as much included in the general good, &s;ince it equally conduces to the happine&s;s of the whole.</P>
<P>And it may be further ob&s;erved, that this love, in which a man regards him&s;elf as part of the whole, and his intere&s;t and happine&s;s, for the &s;ame rea&s;on he regards that of his neighbour, may be exerci&s;ed with greater &s;trength, and more &s;en&s;ibly, with re&s;pect to his own inte|re&s;t and welfare, than towards that of his neighbour, who is as worthy of regard as him&s;elf; &amp; yet there be nothing &s;elfi&s;h in his affection, but it may be wholly of the nature of general benevolence.&mdash;And that for two rea&s;ons&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. He has a more clear, full and con&s;tant view of him|&s;elf and his intere&s;t, than he can have of his neighbour's; therefore he mu&s;t be more affected with the former, and it will be more the object of his concern, than the latter. As man is not omni&s;cient, and his mind cannot compre|hend univer&s;al being; but is limited in his views and ex|erci&s;es, he mu&s;t be mo&s;t affected with tho&s;e objects which are mo&s;t in his view. This is right, and his duty: And not to be thus affected is incon&s;i&s;tent with general bene|volence.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="012811_0030_0F8AC02297A14930">2. Every per&s;on has a more particular and immediate care of him&s;elf committed to him by God, than of his neighbour. As he is under greater advantages to know his own &s;tate and circum&s;tances, wants and enjoyments, and promote his own intere&s;t, in general, than another can be; &s;o this concern is more e&s;pecially committed to him; which is a further rea&s;on why he &s;hould pay a greater regard to it, than to that of his neighbour, though in it&s;elf as great and important as his own. This is not &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; but the genuine exerci&s;e of di&s;intere&s;ted be|nevolence.</P>
<P>Thus a man who has a benevolent regard for a whole community or kingdom, and is equally a friend to every part and each per&s;on of that community, and equally ex|erts him&s;elf for the welfare of each, &s;o far they come under his notice; when he is fixed in a particular town, and thereby obtains a clearer knowledge of their circum|&s;tances, both good and evil, and of the be&s;t means to pro|mote their greate&s;t happine&s;s, he will nece&s;&s;arily turn his attention to them more con&s;tantly and in a greater degree, and be more &s;en&s;ibly affected with their mi&s;eries and en|joyments, than with tho&s;e of the neighbouring towns. And of the inhabitants of this town, they who&s;e circum|&s;tances and intere&s;t are mo&s;t in his view; and who by their particular &s;ituation and connexion, are mo&s;t under his care, will have the fir&s;t and greate&s;t &s;hare of his atten|tion and benevolent regards. This is no evidence, that he is &s;elfi&s;h; it is the natural, genuine exerci&s;e of gene|ral benevolence.</P>
<P>This view may &s;erve to &s;hew us one rea&s;on why, in ma|ny ca&s;es, 'tis &s;o difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h that &s;elf-love which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, from the benevolence which is its contrary; and why the&s;e are often confounded, and taken for the &s;ame thing. That &s;elf-love which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, has &s;elf for its fir&s;t and &s;upreme object, and is
<PB N="23" REF="012811_0031_0F8AC02391A8E790">
extended to others, only as they are viewed as more or le&s;s favourable to the intere&s;t of &s;elf, as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Thus &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s may extend to a whole community, and each individual member of it; becau&s;e the &s;elfi&s;h man con&s;iders their welfare as connected with his own. And as his welfare is commonly in a higher degree, and more &s;en&s;ibly connected with the welfare of tho&s;e who are near|e&s;t to him, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who love him; he will have a greater regard &s;till for them and their welfare, purely from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or for his own &s;ake. And &s;ince his near relations, his own family and children, are in a &s;en&s;e a part of him&s;elf; and his intere&s;t and happine&s;s is in a peculiar manner dependent on their's, his &s;elfi&s;h regards will be more particularly extended to them. In this re|&s;pect there is in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s a re&s;emblance to what is found in benevolence; which, though it con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;intere&s;ted good-will to the whole, is, as ob&s;erved above, neverthe|le&s;s exerci&s;ed by the benevolent per&s;on to individuals; and more &s;trongly to tho&s;e who are more nearly connect|ed with him, and more particularly to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is, however, a great difference, and oppo&s;ition in the&s;e two kinds of affection; which appears from what has been already &s;aid. This &s;elfi&s;h affection, though ex|tended to the whole community with which the &s;elfi&s;h man is connected, is at bottom nothing but love to him|&s;elf. This is the foundation and center of his love. He in reality loves nothing but him&s;elf, and regards others wholly for his own &s;ake. Therefore, when he con&s;iders their welfare as incon&s;i&s;tent with his own; or any way oppo&s;ing or impeding his intere&s;t, his heart will turn again&s;t them, and hate them, whatever be their connexion or rela|tion. On the other hand, the regard to a man's own in|tere&s;t, which is included in general good-will, is not love of him&s;elf, as &s;uch: There is nothing contracted and &s;el|fi&s;h in this affection, which is founded on his good-will to the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="012811_0032_0F8AC02596C1D228">This brings into view another thing, in which the&s;e two &s;orts of love of &s;elf differ, and oppo&s;e each other. He who&s;e regard to him&s;elf and his own intere&s;t does not ari&s;e from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, but general benevolence, is ready to give up his own per&s;onal good, for the &s;ake of the whole: He de&s;ires no good for him&s;elf, unle&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with the common good. Whatever &s;uppo&s;ed good of his own, or of another, interferes with the greate&s;t general good, is no good to him, but the object of his aver&s;ion, in this view of it: So that all his own particular intere&s;t is &s;ub|ordinate to that of the whole. This is nece&s;&s;ary, when regard to our&s;elves is but a branch of general good-will. Thus the intere&s;t of the benevolent man is the common intere&s;t, and he has no other. In a word, he &s;ubjects and devotes him&s;elf, and all things, to the glory of God, and the happine&s;s and glory of his church and kingdom; which is the greate&s;t univer&s;al good, and includes the highe&s;t good of the creature; he having no other inter|e&s;t but this.</P>
<P>But that &s;elf-love which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, is, in this re&s;pect, mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to this. So far as the heart is go|verned by this, it does not, it cannot give up its own pri|vate good, for the &s;ake of the greate&s;t public good; &s;ince, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, he knows no good but the former, and every thing is by him &s;ubordinated to that.&mdash;But enough has been &s;aid to &s;hew the difference and oppo&s;ition there is between &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and that regard and concern a be|nevolent per&s;on has for his own intere&s;t, as a part of the whole, which is nece&s;&s;arily implied in general benevo|lence.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, though <HI>inordinate</HI> &s;elf-love is &s;inful, it is not &s;o in it&s;elf; but when joined with love to God and our neighbour, and &s;ubordinate to the general good, it is a virtuous, holy affection: And to confirm this, the divine command has been alledged,
<Q>Thou &s;halt love thy

neighbour, <HI>as thy&s;elf.</HI></Q>
Here, it is &s;aid, we are com|manded to love our&s;elves, as much as our neighbour. Self love is therefore not a &s;in, but a duty, &s;o long as it does not exceed due bounds.</P>
<P>Upon this the following things may be ob&s;erved:</P>
<P N="1">1. It is utterly unaccountable, and carries in it a direct contradiction, that the &s;ame affection, when exerci&s;ed in a certain limited degree, &s;hould be holine&s;s; but when ex|erci&s;ed in a higher and &s;tronger degree, &s;hould not only have le&s;s holine&s;s, but change its nature, and become &s;in. This none will a&s;&s;ert, after due attention: Yet this is a&s;&s;erted in the propo&s;ition under con&s;ideration. However &s;elf-love may be re&s;trained, it is &s;till &s;elf-love, and of the &s;ame nature with that which is under no re&s;traint; and therefore as oppo&s;ite to holine&s;s, though not to &s;o great a degree, and the bad effects of it may not be &s;o great, or &s;o manife&s;t. A devouring bea&s;t of prey, when confined in a cage, may not be &s;o mi&s;chievous, or appear &s;o dreadful, as when let loo&s;e, and de&s;troying all before him: But his nature is not changed by his confinement; he is &s;till, in his nature, not a harmle&s;s creature, but a bea&s;t of prey.</P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;elf-love cannot be &s;ubordinate to the good of the whole; it is contrary to the very nature of it, and im|plies a contradiction. It &s;eeks to advance &s;elf only, and &s;ubordinates every thing to this; and therefore will not con&s;ent that &s;elf &s;hould be &s;ubordinated to any thing el&s;e, or have any rival. Whenever it con&s;ents to this, it is no longer &s;elf-love, but generous, di&s;intere&s;ted affection; as contrary to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, as mercy is to inju&s;tice and cruelty. Such a con&s;ent and change is, however, impo&s;&s;ible, being a contradiction. This affection mu&s;t be rooted out, or counteracted; and a directly oppo&s;ite affection mu&s;t take place, in order to a per&s;on's &s;ubordinating his own per&s;o|nal intere&s;t to any other intere&s;t what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Therefore, if they who &s;peak of &s;elf-love, &s;o regulated as to be &s;ubordinate to a proper regard to others, and to
<PB N="26" REF="012811_0034_0F8AC02C1ABE2930">
the general good, mean any thing which is con&s;i&s;t|ent, and agreeable to the truth, they, mu&s;t intend that re|gard to our&s;elves, which is not &s;elf-love, but real benevo|lence to the whole, and re&s;pects our&s;elves as part of the whole only. This regard to our&s;elves, as has been &s;hewn, is always, of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ubordinate to the good of the whole.</P>
<P N="3">3. Self-love is &s;o far from being enjoined or approved in the command, 'Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf,' that it is utterly forbidden. Self-love is wholly a partial affection, giving all to our&s;elves, and nothing to our neighbour, and is therefore oppo&s;ed to love to him; e&s;pecially to loving him as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nothing but univer&s;al benevolence can be obedience to this command; and &s;o far as this takes place it is o|beyed, and &s;elf-love is oppo&s;ed and mortified. This be|nevolence, as has been &s;hewn, implies a proper regard to our&s;elves, and an equal regard to our neighbour; having all that impartiality, and love to our neighbour and our|&s;elves, which this law requires.&mdash;And, by the way, this is a clear evidence that univer&s;al benevolence, with the affection implied in it, is that in which all holine&s;s con|&s;i&s;ts, &s;ince no other kind of love is obedience to this com|mand; but he who has this, does of nece&s;&s;ity love his neighbour as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ON the whole, it appears that three different kinds of affection have been called &s;elf-love. The fir&s;t is neither &s;in nor holine&s;s, but is equally implied in both. The two la&s;t are directly oppo&s;ed to each other; the latter be|ing general, di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, extended to our|&s;elves as included in the whole; and is the &s;ame holy love which has God and our neighbour for its object. The other is contracted &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, by which &s;elf only is re|garded, and exalted above God and our neighbour, and in oppo&s;ition to the general good; and is, in every degree of it, &s;inful&mdash;This &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is properly called &s;elf-love; and in this &s;en&s;e the word will be u&s;ed in the following inquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="012811_0035_0F8AC02E120C1A18">That univer&s;al benevolence is the whole of holine&s;s; and, on the other hand, all &s;in con&s;i&s;ts in &s;elf-love, will more fully appear by the following con&s;ideration of each, in its exerci&s;es and fruits.</P>
<P>Univer&s;al good will comprehends all the love to God, our neighbour, and our&s;elves, required in the law of God; and therefore mu&s;t be the whole of holy obedience.&mdash; Every pious &s;entiment and affection is compri&s;ed in this; and all piety in words and practice is but an expre&s;&s;ion of this love: Where this love is not, all outward expre&s;&s;ions of piety, in words and actions, are emptine&s;s and hypocri&s;y. Let any &s;erious per&s;on think what are the particular branches of true piety: Let him view each one by it|&s;elf; and when he has di&s;covered the nature and e&s;&s;ence of it, he will find that di&s;intere&s;ted, friendly affection is its di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic. For in&s;tance, let fear and reverence of the divine maje&s;ty be con&s;idered in this view. What but love and friendly affection di&s;tingui&s;hes this from the fear and dread of devils? All the holine&s;s in pious fear, by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the fear of the wicked, con&s;i&s;ts in love. Leave all di&s;intere&s;ted, friendly affection to the divine being out of fear, and all holine&s;s is excluded.&mdash;</P>
<P>Again, if we con&s;ider what is contained in true gra|titude to God, we &s;hall find di&s;intere&s;ted, kind affection, the only thing wherein it differs from the affection of the mo&s;t wicked creature. Where there is no good will, there is nothing in what is called gratitude, better than that which the legion of devils exerci&s;ed, when they were &s;o far gratified by Chri&s;t, as to be &s;uffered to de&s;troy the herd of &s;wine. But &s;o far as good-will is exerci&s;ed, the goodne&s;s of God to us and others, will excite holy grati|tude; which is nothing el&s;e but good-will to God and our neighbour, in which we our&s;elves are included, and corre&s;pondent affection, excited and acted out in the view of the good will and kindne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>And univer&s;al good will implies the whole of that af|fection
<PB N="28" REF="012811_0036_0F8AC02E8A334078">
and duty we owe to our neighbour. It all con|&s;i&s;ts in the exerci&s;e and expre&s;&s;ion of this, and tho&s;e af|fections that are implied in it. The exerci&s;e and practice of righteou&s;ne&s;s or ju&s;tice towards our neighbour, im|plies a benevolent regard to him and his intere&s;t. Where this is not, there is no exerci&s;e and practice of ju&s;tice in the heart, whatever is the external conduct; for ju&s;tice con&s;i&s;ts in doing to our neighbour, as we would he &s;hould do to us; or, in other words, loving our neigh|bour as our&s;elves. And where this benevolent regard to our neighbour is, there is ju&s;tice; for this love worketh no ill to our neighbour.&mdash;And as righteou&s;ne&s;s, truth and faithfulne&s;s are implied in univer&s;al benevolence, &s;o are temperance and cha&s;tity, or &s;obriety in the proper re&s;traint and government of our own appetites and pa&s;&s;ions: For 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee that the undue indulgence of the&s;e is con|trary to benevolence, as tending to hurt others, or our|&s;elves, or both; and &s;o is oppo&s;ite to the general good, and the divine command, in which all the crime of &s;uch indulgence con&s;i&s;ts. In &s;hort, there is not any one virtue, or branch of godline&s;s, humanity or &s;obriety; not any duty we owe to God, our neighbour, or our&s;elves, that is not comprehended in univer&s;al benevolence; and is not nece&s;&s;arily exerci&s;ed and practi&s;ed, &s;o far as this af|fection takes place in the heart: And where there is no defect in the latter, the former are found in their fulne&s;s and perfection: For the whole is nothing but benevo|lence acted out in its proper nature, and perfection; or love to God and our neighbour made perfect in all its genuine exerci&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>On the contrary, all &s;in con&s;i&s;ts in &s;elf-love, and what is implied in this.</P>
<P>Self-love is, in its whole nature, and in every degree of it, enmity again&s;t God. It is not &s;ubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be; and is the only affection that can oppo&s;e it. It cannot be reconciled to any of God's conduct, rightly under&s;tood; but is in its very nature
<PB N="29" REF="012811_0037_0F8AC02F52175CE8">
rebellion again&s;t it; which is all an expre&s;&s;ion of that love which is mo&s;t contrary to &s;elf-love. This is there|fore the fruitful &s;ource of every exerci&s;e and act of impie|ty and rebellion again&s;t God, and contempt of him, that ever was, or can be.&mdash;Self-love exerci&s;ed and indulged, blinds the heart to every true moral excellence and beau|ty. This does not &s;uit the ta&s;te of the &s;elfi&s;h heart, but gives it di&s;gu&s;t. Self-love is the foundation and rea&s;on of all that blindne&s;s to &s;piritual things, to God, his glorious character, works and kingdom, which the &s;cripture re|pre&s;ents wicked men to have; and is therefore the &s;ource of all the errors which men imbibe, as well as all the open idolatry in the heathen world, and fal&s;e reli|gion under the light of the go&s;pel. All this is agreeable to that &s;elf-love which oppo&s;es God's true character; and under the influence of this, men go off from the truth, and believe, love and practice a lie; it being it&s;elf the greate&s;t practical lie in nature, as it &s;ets up that which is comparatively nothing, above univer&s;al exi&s;t|ence. Self-love is the &s;ource of all the profanene&s;s and impiety in the world; and of all pride and ambition a|mong men; which is nothing but &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s acted out in this particular way. This is at the bottom of all the worldline&s;s and &s;en&s;uality that men run into; as it blinds their eyes to all true good, contracts their hearts, and &s;inks them down, &s;o that they look upon worldly enjoy|ments to be the greate&s;t good, and that in which their true intere&s;t lies. This is the &s;pring of all the hatred and ill-will, &s;trife and contention among men; for this leads men to hate and oppo&s;e all tho&s;e whom they view in the way of their own &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t. This is the &s;ource of all fal&s;ehood, inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion under the &s;un; in which men are, through their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;eeking, by undue methods, to invade the right and property of others. Self-love produces all the violent pa&s;&s;ions, envy, wrath, clamour and evil &s;peaking, of which men are guilty. Take away &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and all the&s;e would cea&s;e imme|diately.
<PB N="30" REF="012811_0038_0F8AC0300DCFCFF8">
And if there be any other &s;in, any thing which is contrary to the divine law, it is briefly compre|hended in this fruitful &s;ource of all iniquity, SELF-LOVE.</P>
<P>And hence we may &s;ee that holy love is wholly a <HI>di&s;in|tere&s;ted</HI> affection, and in what &s;en&s;e it is &s;o. Self-love is wholly an intere&s;ted affection, as &s;elf is the only object of it. Holy love has no regard to &s;elf, as &s;elf; but is a re|gard to the greate&s;t general good and intere&s;t; the glory of God in the highe&s;t glory of his kingdom, and the greate&s;t good of the creation. So far as a man exerci&s;es holy love, he has no other intere&s;t but this; as all is devoted to this, and given up for the &s;ake of it. And in this &s;en&s;e all his love is di&s;intere&s;ted, as it &s;eeks not any &s;elf intere&s;t, but the contrary. He who ex|erci&s;es this di&s;intere&s;ted love, has plea&s;ure indeed, and is pur&s;uing an intere&s;t and happine&s;s; though 'tis not a &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t, but that in the pur&s;uit of which he renoun|ces what &s;elf-love &s;eeks.</P>
<P>A judge is &s;aid to be intere&s;ted in a cau&s;e he is to de|cide, &s;o far as his own per&s;onal intere&s;t is concerned in it, and his &s;elf-love will influence him to take one &s;ide, rather than the other; which renders him unfit to judge the cau&s;e. But if his own per&s;onal intere&s;t is not concerned in the ca&s;e, and there be nothing to bias him to one &s;ide rather than the other, he is &s;aid to be di&s;intere&s;ted. And though he may be bribed, or &s;ome way intere&s;ted in the matter; yet if he is not at all influenced by this, and de|cides the cau&s;e contrary to the dictates of &s;elf-love, he is &s;aid to act di&s;intere&s;tedly. In &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as this, all ho|ly affection is di&s;intere&s;ted. Such a judge, when he re|nounces all &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations, and e&s;pou&s;es the cau&s;e of the widow and fatherle&s;s, and delivers them from the hand of oppre&s;&s;ors, has an intere&s;t which he &s;eeks; but not an intere&s;t, which &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s prompts him to pur|&s;ue: And the more he intere&s;ts him&s;elf in the cau&s;e of the poor, helple&s;s widow, and the greater plea&s;ure he takes in helping her, the more di&s;intere&s;ted are his ex|ertions
<PB N="31" REF="012811_0039_0F8AC030D67A8C10">
and conduct, and the more is &s;elf-love counter|acted and mortified.</P>
<P>So, he who, in the exerci&s;e of holy love, pur&s;ues the glory of God, and the highe&s;t intere&s;t and happine&s;s of his kingdom, which includes the greate&s;t good of his fellow creatures; pur&s;ues the be&s;t, the mo&s;t important intere&s;t, and has the mo&s;t noble, refined plea&s;ure in the exerci&s;e of this affection; yet in all this he is wholly di&s;|intere&s;ted, as he oppo&s;es &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and all regard to &s;elf, which is not implied in being thus devoted to the greate&s;t general good; and for&s;akes the whole intere&s;t which &s;elf-love &s;eeks, for the kingdom of God's &s;ake.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> In which the foregoing account of &s;in and holine&s;s is &s;hewn to be agreeable to rea&s;on.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. IT is mo&s;t rea&s;onable that the common and greate&s;t good of the whole &s;hould be &s;ought by every par|ticular member of it: That every one &s;hould be &s;o de|voted to the good of the whole, as to give up the le&s;s good of individuals, and con&s;equently his own per&s;onal intere&s;t, whenever incon&s;i&s;tent herewith. Thus, it is highly rea&s;onable that a particular member of a commu|nity &s;hould cheerfully give up all his per&s;onal intere&s;t, his whole e&s;tate, and even his life, when this is evident|ly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave the whole nation from ruin. If a ci|ty is on fire, and in order to &s;top its progre&s;s, and &s;ave the city, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that the hou&s;e of a particular per&s;on &s;hould be totally demoli&s;hed; he &s;hould with plea&s;ure give up his hou&s;e to be de&s;troyed, however magnificent and co&s;tly, and though it contains all he has in the world. If in this ca&s;e a man &s;hould he&s;itate a mo|ment, and be inclined to &s;ave his own hou&s;e, to the utter de&s;truction of the whole city; every one would condemn him as acting a mo&s;t unrea&s;onable, &s;ordid part. But if
<PB N="32" REF="012811_0040_0F8AC0318D4EB148">
he is &s;uch a friend to the city, and intere&s;ts him&s;elf &s;o much in its welfare, as to take more plea&s;ure in &s;aving it, even at the expence of all he has in the world, than a &s;el|fi&s;h man can have in whatever he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, he will be ap|plauded as one of an excellent &s;pirit. And every one mu&s;t grant he ought to be imitated by all. And it is rea&s;onable that every one of the &s;ociety &s;hould be regard|ed by the re&s;t, according to his importance and worth; his di&s;po&s;ition and ability to promote the greate&s;t good of the whole community.</P>
<P>But this is univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence. No|thing but this will form men to &s;uch exerci&s;es and con|duct. But where this benevolence reigns in every heart, each one will be thus a friend to all. He who has this benevolence, will, by it, be united to the grand commu|nity of the univer&s;e, including all exi&s;tence, and be devo|ted to the good of the whole: And as this is compri&s;ed in the glory of God, and the perfection and happine&s;s of his kingdom, this will be the object of his affection, and he will &s;ubordinate all to this; and in &s;o doing will act a mo&s;t rea&s;onable part.</P>
<P>On the other hand, nothing can be more unrea&s;onable than that every individual &s;hould be altogether &s;elfi&s;h, and &s;eek his own per&s;onal intere&s;t only; not caring what becomes of the community, or any belonging to it, fur|ther that his &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s prompts him to it; being ready at any time to &s;acrifice the public, and the greate&s;t good of every individual to his own private advantage, however important and worthy he is, and whatever obligation he is under to him.</P>
<P>This carries in it every thing mean, mi&s;chievous and perver&s;e. But <HI>this</HI> is &s;elf-love. This is the nature and tendency of every degree of it, though it may be many ways under re&s;traints, and often put on the appearance of benevolence and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P N="2">II. This univer&s;al benevolence alone, can produce the &s;trong, happy union of intelligences, which rea&s;on
<PB N="33" REF="012811_0041_0F8AC0324B075958">
teaches mu&s;t be the attendant of holine&s;s. It fixes each in his proper place, and effects the highe&s;t and mo&s;t beau|tiful harmony conceivable.</P>
<P N="3">III. Rea&s;on teaches that univer&s;al benevolence is the highe&s;t good of intelligences. This makes every one a wi&s;e, hearty friend to all the re&s;t, and devotes him to the public good: By which the highe&s;t common good has the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity, and is advanced to the ut|mo&s;t. Should a king and his &s;ubjects be thus united in the mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip to each other, and entirely de|voted to the highe&s;t general good; each one knowing wherein it con&s;i&s;ts: And the community having wi&s;dom to contrive, and power to execute the be&s;t means to ef|fect it; there would be no evil in this kingdom, but what is nece&s;&s;ary to promote the general good; which would be advanced to the highe&s;t degree; and it mu&s;t be, in this re&s;pect, the mo&s;t happy community imaginable.</P>
<P>And this rai&s;es the happine&s;s of each individual to the highe&s;t pitch his capacity will admit. For his univer&s;al benevolence will nece&s;&s;arily put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the good of the whole, and of every particular, &s;o far as he perceives it, and in proportion to the degree of his be|nevolence. By his di&s;intere&s;ted good will, this is become his good; or he enjoys it as much as if it were his own per&s;onal good; whereby he has immen&s;ely more happine&s;s than in any other po&s;&s;ible way: And, in proportion to his good will to the whole, he takes plea&s;ure in others who are friends to the &s;ame; and mu&s;t be filled with a peculiar &s;atisfaction and delight, while he &s;ees all around him, not only delighting in him&s;elf, as a friend to the whole, but devoted to the general good.</P>
<P>This may be applied to the grand community, THE KINGDOM OF GOD; which comprehends GOD, the &s;u|preme king, and all who are voluntarily united in &s;ubjec|tion to him. The rea&s;on of man cannot invent any way to &s;ecure and promote the happine&s;s of this community, unle&s;s univer&s;al benevolence be introduced. And no o|ther
<PB N="34" REF="012811_0042_0F8AC03311D239B0">
kind of virtue is nece&s;&s;ary to the highe&s;t conceivable good of the whole, and every individual. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This might be more particularly illu&s;trated; but is left to the plea&s;ing contemplation of the benevolent friends of Chri&s;t and his kingdom.</NOTE></P>
<P>But &s;elf-love, when it has its genuine, unre&s;trained in|fluence, de&s;troys all public good. This is the mother of all the lu&s;ts which bring evil into the univer&s;e. It pre|vents individuals enjoying the good of others; and in|deed blinds them to all true happine&s;s. It contracts the the mind, and degrades it below the proper pur&s;uits of a rational creature, and entails mi&s;ery on its unhappy &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The natural world, we know, was created for the moral; and 'tis generally granted that the former is an emblem of the latter. We may hence expect to find <HI>that</HI> in the former, which bears a con&s;picuous analogy to holi|ne&s;s, the perfection and glory of the intellectual &s;y&s;tem: And this mu&s;t be the general law of attraction, the com|mon bond of union in our material &s;y&s;tem; by which all bodies are mutually attracted, and tend to one center: Every part, while it attracts, being al&s;o attracted by the whole, is fixed in its &s;tation, and extends its influence to all; &s;o that each particle has, in a &s;en&s;e, a regard to the whole, and contributes to the general good. This is the &s;ource or the order and beauty &s;o obvious in our world. The &s;un, the center of all, &s;preads his kind influence over the whole; and each inferior body, at the &s;ame time it pays a due regard to all other bodies, pays him a &s;upreme regard. This is one mo&s;t &s;imple affection, univer&s;al at|traction: A mo&s;t clear, &s;triking re&s;emblance of univer&s;al benevolence in the moral world, in which all its union and glory con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Further, the repul&s;ive quality found in &s;ome bodies, by which they re&s;i&s;t others, and which, &s;hould it univer|&s;ally obtain, without control, would i&s;&s;ue in the de&s;truc|tion of the material world, is an apt repre&s;entation of &s;elf-love.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="012811_0043_0F8AC033C7A53EB0">Thus rea&s;on, nature, and, I may add, general experi|ence, join to point out univer&s;al benevolence as the &s;um of all holine&s;s.&mdash;Hence almo&s;t all writers on morality have made virtue to con&s;i&s;t chiefly, if not altogether, in what they call univer&s;al benevolence; though many of them have left GOD and his kingdom, the great object of true benevolence, out of their &s;y&s;tem: Nor have they di&s;tingui&s;hed properly between benevolence and &s;elf-love.</P>

<P>THE holy &s;cripture is the be&s;t and only &s;ure guide in determining the que&s;tion before us; which has therefore been kept in view in what has been already &s;aid: But we &s;hall now con&s;ult it more particularly.</P>
<P N="1">I. The revealed law of God teaches what true holine&s;s is. This is the only &s;tandard of all moral excellence and perfection.

We have con&s;idered what kind of love this mu&s;t be; and arguments have been offered to prove it con&s;i&s;ts in univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted bene|volence: At the &s;ame time, what is meant by this, has been explained. Our pre&s;ent inquiry is, Whether this
<PB N="36" REF="012811_0044_0F8AC034865093C0">
is the love required in the divine law? The an&s;wer is not difficult to him who will attend.</P>
<P>The law does not require &s;elf-love; but love to God and our neighbour; not from &s;elfi&s;h motives, which is no|thing but &s;elf-love extended to them, meerly becau&s;e of our connexion with them, or the benefit we have receiv|ed, or hope to receive from them, or becau&s;e they love us. Our &s;aviour tells us this is not holine&s;s, but con&s;i&s;t|ent with being wholly &s;inful. 'For if ye love them which love you, what reward have you? Do not even the Pub|licans the &s;ame?'<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 46.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let any one con&s;ult his own &s;en&s;e, whether he accepts that as true re&s;pect and love from any one, which appears to be wholly &s;elfi&s;h; being nothing but a regard to the benefit to him&s;elf which he hopes to receive from him. He will at once feel that this has nothing of the nature of true love; but is a mean, &s;ordid affection, which he can|not but de&s;pi&s;e. And this is the &s;en&s;e of all mankind, in their own ca&s;e; however they may put off their maker with &s;uch &s;elfi&s;h affection, and think he will accept it at their hands as true love and holine&s;s. Thus the degene|rate prie&s;ts in I&s;rael offered that to God, which would af|front their governor, had they offered it to him; nor would they accept it from their neighbour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. 1.8.</NOTE></P>
<P>The love to our neighbour, which God's law requires, is certainly univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted good will, &s;ince it is a love which will di&s;po&s;e us to do good unto <HI>all men,</HI> and mu&s;t extend to our greate&s;t enemies: For no love but this will do &s;o. Therefore when Chri&s;t him&s;elf gave an in&s;tance of this love, he produced one in which there is nothing but the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted goodne&s;s; benevolence towards an enemy in di&s;tre&s;s.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. x. 25,&mdash;37.</NOTE> This we are &s;ure he would not have done, if this were not the very love required in the command. And he expre&s;sly declares that the command does not mean a love to our neighbour, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from our enemy, as it was then under&s;tood by the Jews;
<PB N="37" REF="012811_0045_0F8AC035479EA730">
but love to enemies, which wi&s;hes them well, and will lead us to do them good, however injuriou&s;ly they treat us. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 43 44.</NOTE></P>
<P>And is it not very unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;econd command, which our Lord &s;ays is like unto the fir&s;t, requires &s;omething of a different kind, though it is called by the &s;ame name, <HI>love?</HI> There can be no differ|ence but what ari&s;es from the very different objects of this &s;ame love.</P>
<P>St. John teaches us that love to God, and to our brother or neighbour, is in&s;eparable; that he who loves one of the&s;e, certainly and nece&s;&s;arily loves the other; which could not be, if love to God was different in kind from love to our neighbour. 'If any man &s;ay, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. Who&s;o hath this world's good, and &s;eeth his brother have need, and &s;hutteth up his bowels of compa&s;&s;ion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?' <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. iii. 17. iv. 20.</NOTE> It is to be ob&s;erved, that the love to our brother, here &s;poken of, is the love of good will, expre&s;&s;ed in &s;hewing kindne&s;s to him; and indeed the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of no other kind of love in this epi&s;tle, as every in&s;tance of love which he mentions, is love of benevolence. Now, if love to God is not di&s;intere&s;ted good will, how can this imply good will to our brother, or lead to it, &s;o as to form an infalli|ble connexion?</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that he who loves God, is hence led to love his neighbour, in obedience to God's command, and from his example, who is good to all; and not be|cau&s;e love to God, and kind affection to our neighbour, is the &s;ame kind of love. To this it may be an&s;wered,</P>
<P N="1">1. That love to God, which is not di&s;intere&s;ted good will, nor implies it, is no principle of obedience to the divine command, and can have no tendency to it. No love will di&s;po&s;e men to obey God, but the love of 'good will;' <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 7.</NOTE> or the love by which they are true friends of
<PB N="38" REF="012811_0046_0F8AC037AA0216E0">
God. He who does not obey God from this motive, does not obey him at all: He is influenced only by fear, which none will &s;ay is true obedience. Therefore they who a&s;&s;ert we are led to love our neighbour, purely be|cau&s;e God commands it, and from love to him, if they attend to their own ideas, will find they &s;uppo&s;e this to be love of good will, which is the very thing they are at|tempting to oppo&s;e; and &s;o contradict them&s;elves in the &s;uppo&s;ition they make, and really grant all we a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P N="2">2. If love to God, which implies no good will to him, could induce to obedience in any in&s;tance, it would not di&s;po&s;e him to obey this command, and exerci&s;e good will to his neighbour, and &s;uch command will not in the lea&s;t influence him to it. If his inducement to love his neigh|bour is wholly from &s;elfi&s;h principles, which is always the ca&s;e, where there is no di&s;intere&s;ted good will, it is, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, not love of his neighbour, but of him|&s;elf only; and is &s;o far from obedience to the divine com|mand, that it is rebellion again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="3">3. God's univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted good will cannot be a motive to love our neighbour, with the &s;ame good will, any further than we are plea&s;ed with it; for we are ne|ver di&s;po&s;ed to imitate what we di&s;like. But to be plea&s;ed with this goodne&s;s of God, &s;uppo&s;es our hearts to be in the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame; for benevolence is implied in taking plea&s;ure in benevolence, as has been &s;hewn. This therefore &s;uppo&s;es that good will is implied in that love to God, which leads us to the love of good will to our neighbour; &s;o &s;uppo&s;es the very thing it is adduced to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus impo&s;&s;ible is it to account for that in&s;eparable connexion of love to God, with good will to our neigh|bour, which the &s;cripture a&s;&s;erts, unle&s;s this love, in the&s;e two branches of it, is the &s;ame in kind. But if love to God is, in its nature, univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted good will, the &s;cripture repre&s;entation appears con&s;i&s;tent and intelli|gible.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="012811_0047_0F8AC038A0324F40">Thus it appears that the love required in the law of God is univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted goodne&s;s in all its branches, attendants and fruits: Therefore this is holine&s;s. But it mu&s;t be further ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>God in giving &s;uch a law, requiring &s;uch love, has ex|pre&s;&s;ed his univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted goodne&s;s, and &s;hewed that his moral character con&s;i&s;ts in love. We have good authority therefore, even from the divine law, to &s;ay, that GOD IS LOVE. His love is as really expre&s;&s;ed in the law, as in the go&s;pel. In the latter, this di&s;intere&s;ted love and goodne&s;s, which appears in the law, is expre&s;&s;ed and acted out in a more full and glorious manner and degree, and &s;et in a more affecting and &s;triking light. In this &s;en&s;e the law is good, it is love and goodne&s;s, as really as the go&s;pel. And as the divine holine&s;s is expre&s;&s;ed in the law, in requiring love; &s;o the creature, by exerci&s;ing this &s;ame love, is a partaker of God's holine&s;s, or of the divine nature, as the &s;cripture repre&s;ents the matter: He is tran&s;|formed into the image of God; or, as St. John expre&s;&s;es it, 'God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. iv. 16. It is ob&s;ervable, that as the apo&s;tle &s;ays here, 'He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,' he al&s;o &s;ays, chap. iii. ver. 24. 'He that keepeth his commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him.' Whence it appears, that <HI>dwelling in love,</HI> and <HI>keeping God's commandments,</HI> is the &s;ame thing: Con&s;equently love compri&s;es all the obedience required; or, as St. Paul &s;ays, 'Love is the fulfilling of the law.'</NOTE></P>
<P>OBJ. The law is not all love and goodne&s;s. It requires love indeed, but it is guarded with the mo&s;t awful &s;ancti|on, and cur&s;es him who does not obey it perfectly. This is not an expre&s;&s;ion of love, but &s;trict and awful ju&s;tice. What love can there be in cur&s;ing a &s;inner, and puni&s;hing him forever? Love is exerci&s;ed in <HI>&s;aving</HI> &s;inners, but not in <HI>damning</HI> them.</P>
<P>ANS. He who is infinitely good, is in the &s;ame degree an enemy to all oppo&s;ition to the highe&s;t good. This will be the greate&s;t, the only crime in his view; and
<PB N="40" REF="012811_0048_0F8AC03AB83CC638">
from this love, he will be di&s;po&s;ed to maintain his law, which requires love, in the puni&s;hment of all &s;uch who turn enemies to the greate&s;t good of being, according to their de&s;ert. This is the only way in which this love can properly expre&s;s it&s;elf in the divine law. Had God commanded love, and not threatened the contrary with the mo&s;t dreadful puni&s;hment, he would not have expre&s;&s;|&s;ed his love and goodne&s;s, as he has done by this threat|ening. In this view, divine ju&s;tice is nothing but the mo&s;t perfect love and goodne&s;s, exerci&s;ed in a proper way again&s;t the enemies of this goodne&s;s, and manife&s;ted in hating and puni&s;hing &s;uch. And the &s;ufferings in|flicted on the &s;on of God, when he &s;tood in the place of &s;inners; and the eternal puni&s;hment of the wicked in hell, are the nece&s;&s;ary effect and proper expre&s;&s;ion of di|vine love; even that &s;ame love which is expre&s;&s;ed in the precepts of God's law, or by any other medium. This is nothing but univer&s;al benevolence, which &s;eeks the greate&s;t good of the whole, properly expre&s;&s;ed in this way.</P>
<P>Divine love comprehends wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, truth and faithfulne&s;s, and every moral perfection and excellence what&s;oever. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in propo&s;ing the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t end, and pur|&s;uing it by the mo&s;t proper means. This is compri&s;ed in univer&s;al benevolence, which fixes on the greate&s;t good of the whole, and &s;eeks it as the &s;upreme, ultimate end. He who has not univer&s;al benevo|lence, does not propo&s;e and pur&s;ue the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t end; but is wholly blind to it. Thus, univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted goodne&s;s appears to be that in which all true wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts. This therefore mu&s;t be the holine&s;s which is called wi&s;dom in &s;cripture: And its oppo&s;ite, &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s, is the fooli&s;hne&s;s, which is there oppo&s;ed to wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>It may be al&s;o ob&s;erved here, that <HI>righteous</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> often mean the &s;ame thing in &s;cripture; and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> frequently intends ho|line&s;s; and is often u&s;ed to expre&s;s the whole of God's moral charac|ter; though 'tis many times u&s;ed in a more limited &s;en&s;e, and intends holine&s;s as exerci&s;ed with regard to &s;ome particular object. But it never &s;ignifies any thing which is not holine&s;s, and does not com|pri&s;e love; and the whole is comprehended in univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;t|ed benevolence. He who has this, is <HI>righteous</HI>; his heart is <HI>right</HI> towards all beings, and di&s;po&s;ed to give every one his due. This is righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the mo&s;t proper and comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the word; and without this love there is no righteou&s;ne&s;s. Hence righ|teou&s;ne&s;s &s;eems to be put &s;ometimes for goodne&s;s and mercy. See P&s;alm. 36.10.89.16.103.17.143.11, 12.145.7.&mdash;So holine&s;s evidently means the divine goodne&s;s. See P&s;al. 30.4.97.12.</P></NOTE> What is called by the&s;e different names,
<PB N="41" REF="012811_0049_0F8AC03B462EBBB0">
is but one mo&s;t &s;imple thing, even divine LOVE; for God in his whole moral character is <HI>love.</HI> Take away love and goodne&s;s, and there will be neither wi&s;dom, truth, faithfulne&s;s, nor ju&s;tice; for they have no exi&s;t|ence but in the exerci&s;e of love; and love implies all the&s;e, and nece&s;&s;arily acts out, &s;o as to form a character, properly denoted by the&s;e names, as it appears to crea|tures in different relations, and re&s;pects different objects.</P>
<P>The law of God then leads us to con&s;ider holine&s;s as con&s;i&s;ting in univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted good will, con&s;idered in all its genuine exerci&s;es and fruits, and acted out in all its branches towards God, and our neighbour. This holine&s;s is exerci&s;ed towards God, in &s;uch a regard and kind affection for him, as to be wholly devoted to his honor and intere&s;t, and the honor and glory of his king|dom, and &s;eek it, as the highe&s;t and ultimate end. This good will exerci&s;ed towards God, his kingdom and intere&s;t, with all tho&s;e affections it compri&s;es, is to love God with all the heart.&mdash;This &s;ame holine&s;s or love is exerci&s;ed to|wards our neighbour, in wi&s;hing and pur&s;uing the greate&s;t good of all, and of our&s;elves as included in the whole; and in all that di&s;intere&s;ted affection which is nece&s;&s;arily implied in this.</P>
<P>And let it be ob&s;erved here, that this love to our neigh|bour, as it regards the greate&s;t good of the whole, as its chief object, and re&s;pects the good of individuals, as in|cluded in this; and as the greate&s;t good of mankind con|&s;i&s;ts in being the voluntary &s;ubjects and &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, in belonging to his kingdom, and promoting the highe&s;t intere&s;t of that: This love, I &s;ay, is not real|ly a di&s;tinct thing from &s;eeking the glory and kingdom
<PB N="42" REF="012811_0050_0F8AC03F5C7625E8">
of God; as the&s;e perfectly coincide. In &s;eeking the glory of God, and intere&s;t of his kingdom, we nece&s;&s;arily &s;eek the greate&s;t good of mankind; and &s;o far as we are devoted to their be&s;t intere&s;t, we act as friends to God, and &s;eek his honor, and the intere&s;t of his kingdom. The whole therefore is &s;ummed up in <HI>&s;eeking fir&s;t the kingdom of God,</HI> or making this our &s;upreme and ultimate end; &s;o as to be willing to do or &s;uffer any thing that &s;hall be ne|ce&s;&s;ary or proper to promote this. In this the love of God and our neighbour center in one point, &s;o that they cannot be divided; and this affection in which all holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, really has but one object, viz. THE KINGDOM OF GOD. Our divine teacher &s;ets the matter in this light, and &s;peaks as no man would have &s;poke, when he directs men to &s;eek the kingdom of God, as the only object of their pur&s;uit, for the &s;ake of which he commands them to for&s;ake every other intere&s;t. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See Matt. vi. 33. Luk. xii. 31. xviii. 29.&mdash;In Matthew the words are, "Seek fir&s;t the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s." The kingdom of God is the kingdom which Chri&s;t is erecting, and bringing to its highe&s;t perfection and glory; and comprehends God's moral kingdom, in its whole extent; in which is the full and mo&s;t complete di&s;play of the divine perfections, or glory; and all the good and happine&s;s of the creation. This is 'that great city, the holy Jeru&s;alem,' which St. John &s;aw, 'de&s;cending out of hea|ven from God, <HI>having the glory of God,</HI>' Rev. xxi. 10.11. To &s;eek this kingdom <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> is to make the intere&s;t, happine&s;s and glory of it our ultimate end, &s;o as to do all for its &s;ake, and &s;ubordinate every thing to this. This kingdom, con&s;idered in its full extent, and all its appendages, is the fir&s;t, the only object of the de&s;ires and pur&s;uit of Chri&s;t him&s;elf: So that in the&s;e words he directs his di&s;|ciples to imitate him, and be holy, as he is holy.</P>
<P>By <HI>his righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is not meant any thing di&s;tinct from the kingdom of God. It intends the divine perfections di&s;played in this kingdom, in the glorious work of redemption, including the &s;alva|tion of the redeemed, and the complete overthrow of all his enemies. In this &s;en&s;e the word is u&s;ed in the following pa&s;&s;ages. 'The Lord God will cau&s;e <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>prai&s;e</HI> to &s;pring forth before all na|tions.&mdash;And the Gentiles &s;hall &s;ee <HI>thy righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and all kings <HI>thy glory.</HI>' I&s;ai. 61.11.62.2. 'Hearken to me, ye that follow af|ter righteou&s;ne&s;s, ye that &s;eek the Lord&mdash;For the Lord &s;hall com|fort Zion, &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>My &s;alvation</HI> &s;hall be forever, and <HI>my righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;hall not be aboli&s;hed. Hearken unto me, ye that know <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the people in who&s;e heart is my law, fear ye not the reproach of men&mdash; For the moth &s;hall eat them up like a garment, and the worm &s;hall eat them like wool: But <HI>my righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;hall be forever, and <HI>my &s;al|vation</HI> from generation to generation chap. 51.1,&mdash;8. Here, to follow after righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;eek the Lord, is to &s;eek fir&s;t the king|dom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s. And God's <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and his <HI>&s;alvation,</HI> mean the &s;ame thing. This being &s;o, when St. Luke mentions this injunction of our Lord, he puts it in the following words, 'But rather &s;eek ye <HI>the kingdom of God</HI>'; this including the whole: For if <HI>his righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> was not included in this, it would not be omitted.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing is inculcated by Chri&s;t, when he directs and en|courages all to &s;ubordinate every thing, however dear to them, to this grand intere&s;t, and for&s;ake all 'for the kingdom of God's &s;ake,' Luk. 18.29. It is ob&s;ervable that in a parallel text (Mark 10.29) in&s;tead of <HI>the kingdom of God's &s;ake,</HI> the words are '<HI>for my &s;ake, and the go&s;pel's,</HI>' becau&s;e the&s;e words expre&s;s the very &s;ame thing. The kingdom of God and the go&s;pel are the &s;ame: Therefore to preach the go&s;pel, is to preach the kingdom of God. Luk. 4.43.9.2, 60. Act. 20.25. And 'tis called the go&s;pel of the kingdom of God, Mark 1.14. And as this is Chri&s;t's kingdom and intere&s;t, compri|&s;ing him&s;elf, and the whole which he &s;eeks; whatever is done for the &s;ake of the kingdom of God, is done for his &s;ake.</P>
<P>The holine&s;s of the mediator is wholly exerci&s;ed in &s;eeking this kingdom: His righteou&s;ne&s;s, by which &s;inners are ju&s;tified, con&s;i&s;ts in what he did and &s;uffered for its &s;ake.

<P>St. John &s;ays, 'God is love.' By which 'tis evident he means to expre&s;s the whole of God's moral character.

Therefore we are called upon to imitate this love of God, as that by which we may be like him, partakers of his holine&s;s.

one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.' If we love one another with that love which God exerci&s;ed and manife&s;ted in giving his &s;on to die for us, we by this are conformed to God, his image is in us, and his love, which is his holine&s;s, is complete and perfect in us. What words could more expre&s;sly declare that the divine holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially in di&s;intere&s;ted goodne&s;s; and that in the exerci&s;e of this, we are holy, as God is holy? To the like purpo&s;e is what Chri&s;t &s;ays to his di&s;ciples. When he is recommending to them the high|e&s;t exerci&s;e of di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, in love to their enemies; he tells them that they would hereby imitate God, who is good to his enemies; and then &s;ays, 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.' <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 44, 48.</NOTE> According to this, the holine&s;s and perfection of God and his people, con&s;i&s;ts, &s;o much at lea&s;t, in di&s;interered benevolence, that there is no moral perfection without it, in God or the creature. The rea|der will ob&s;erve how exactly parallel the&s;e words of Chri&s;t are to tho&s;e of St. John, we have been con&s;idering.

<P>ANS. 1&s;t. According to the&s;e &s;criptures, God's love of benevolence is &s;poken of as the mo&s;t bright and &s;triking expre&s;&s;ion of the excellence of his nature and character, or his holine&s;s; and that love in us which is an imitation of this love of God, is repre&s;ented as that in which our conformity to God con&s;i&s;ts; which could not be true, or a proper repre&s;entation, if holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in &s;omething of another kind, not included in this. We have therefore good ground to conclude from the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages, that this is the leading excellence, and the &s;um of all holine&s;s in God and the creature; e&s;pecially as holine&s;s exerci&s;ed toward the creature mu&s;t be of the &s;ame nature with that of which God is the object.

If this love of benevolence, this amazing goodne&s;s of God's nature, expre&s;&s;ed in redeeming &s;inners, and giving them eternal life through Chri&s;t, is &s;o much the glory of the divine character, and &s;uch a clear and bright expre&s;&s;ion of his perfection and holine&s;s, as is re|pre&s;ented in &s;cripture, this gives us rea&s;on to conclude that the love of which he him&s;elf is the object, is of the &s;ame nature and kind with this, viz. an infinite benevo|lent regard to him&s;elf; and that his love to man, expre&s;&s;|ed in giving his &s;on for his &s;alvation, is a &s;tream, and the brighte&s;t emanation from this fountain of love; and &s;o &s;hews the nature of the infinite divine love and holine&s;s.

It wholly con&s;i&s;ted in conformity to that law, which he him|&s;elf &s;aid was fulfilled by love to God and our neighbour: Therefore it all con&s;i&s;ted in love: And if we properly attend to what he has &s;aid &amp; done, we may, with the great|e&s;t certainty, determine the nature and kind of this love. His love to men was, in the highe&s;t degree, di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, as it was love to enemies; and &s;uch a re|gard for their good, as to lead him to be willing to take their mi&s;ery on him&s;elf, and bear it all, that they might e&s;cape, and live forever. This is the highe&s;t in&s;tance of pure, di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence that ever was known; and it is commonly &s;poken of as &s;uch, and the excellen|cy of it is owned to con&s;i&s;t very much in its being in &s;uch a &s;triking degree <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> love and goodne&s;s. Thus Chri&s;t's example of love to men con&s;i&s;ts wholly in di&s;in|tere&s;ted goodne&s;s: If this is left out, there remains no|thing holy and excellent.</P>
<P>His love to God was al&s;o a di&s;intere&s;ted, benevolent love, as it was acted out in &s;eeking and promoting the glory of God. He &s;ought not his own glory, but the glory of him that &s;ent him. And this he him&s;elf &s;peaks of as that in which the di&s;tingui&s;hing excellence of his character con&s;i&s;ted. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Joh. vii. 13. viii 50.</NOTE> This was the great thing he pur|&s;ued, as the work he had to do.

through the dreadful &s;cene of &s;ufferings that is before me.' Thus, 'Chri&s;t PLEASED NOT HIMSELF, but, as it is written, the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.' <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xv. 31.</NOTE> He plea&s;ed not him&s;elf, i. e. he &s;ought not him&s;elf, was not in the lea&s;t degree &s;elfi&s;h; but at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from it. He had &s;uch a &s;trong, di&s;|intere&s;ted, benevolent regard to the glory of God, in the advancement of his kingdom, in the &s;alvation of men, that all the reproach ca&s;t upon God by &s;in, fell with its full weight on him; and that he might vindicate the divine character, and take away the reproach that would come on God and his law, if &s;inners were &s;aved without a complete atonement, he took the reproach and puni&s;h|ment of &s;in on him&s;elf; that hereby God might be ho|nored in the &s;alvation of &s;inners. Thus <HI>he plea&s;ed not him&s;elf,</HI> but practi&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;elf-denial; and took all the evil on him&s;elf, that God might be glorified, and &s;inners be &s;aved: This St. Paul mentions as an example to his di&s;ciples, in following which, they mu&s;t not plea&s;e them&s;elves, mu&s;t not be &s;elfi&s;h, and &s;eek them&s;elves; but the good of others, in the exerci&s;e of di&s;intere&s;ted be|nevolence. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ver. 1, 2.</NOTE> Thus he him&s;elf followed Chri&s;t, and imita|ted his holine&s;s, which he &s;ought not his own profit, but the profit of many, that they might be &s;aved. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>1 Cor. x. 33. xi. 1. When the apo&s;tle &s;ays, 'I &s;eek not mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be &s;aved;' he ex|pre&s;&s;es the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence; and a di&s;po&s;ition to give up every thing that could be called his own, to promote the &s;alva|tion of many. In this he followed Chri&s;t, who plea&s;ed not him&s;elf, and &s;ought not his own profit, but gave him&s;elf away, delivered him|&s;elf up to infinite evil, for the &s;ake of others, that they might be &s;av|ed. The&s;e words lead us to the true &s;en&s;e of that pa&s;&s;age, which has been &s;o difficult to many. 'For I could wi&s;h that my&s;elf were accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t, for my brethren, my kin&s;men according to the fle&s;h.' Rom. ix. 3. The plain meaning of the&s;e words is, that he intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o much in the &s;alvation of his brethren, that he was willing to give up all his own per&s;onal intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, for their &s;akes, if by this means they might be &s;aved. This is the ge|nuine expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, which always gives up a le&s;s good for a greater, and the private good of individuals for the &s;ake of the public good, or the &s;alvation of many. Therefore, if the apo&s;tle could &s;ave all his brethren by giving up his own per&s;onal in|tere&s;t in Chri&s;t, he ought to be ready to do it; for not to do it, in this ca&s;e, would be to &s;eek his own profit, in oppo&s;ition to the profit of many, and to act mo&s;t contrary to benevolence; and to the example of Chri&s;t, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for many, and was willingly <HI>made a cur&s;e,</HI> that men might be &s;aved from it.</P>
<P>I know there have been many objections made to this &s;en&s;e of the words. It is &s;aid, this repre&s;ents the apo&s;tle as willing to be an ene|my to Chri&s;t, and to be damned forever, which is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>An&s;. It is indeed a contradiction, that he &s;hould be willing to be|come an enemy to Chri&s;t, in the exerci&s;e of that benevolence in which he imitated him, and acted as his friend: e&s;pecially that this benevo|lence &s;hould <HI>make him willing</HI> to be Chri&s;t's enemy. But no &s;uch thing is expre&s;&s;ed in the words. The apo&s;tle might be willing to give up his own per&s;onal intere&s;t in Chri&s;t for the &s;ake of the &s;alva|tion of millions &amp; yet not be willing to be an enemy to Chri&s;t: And indeed it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be an enemy to him, while in the exerci&s;e of &s;uch benevolence; ju&s;t as impo&s;&s;ible as it was that he &s;hould be willing his brethren &s;hould all be lo&s;t, while he was ardently wi&s;h|ing their &s;alvation, tho' it were at the expence of his own.</P>
<P>As to his being willing to be damned; he was willing to give up all the happine&s;s, and &s;uffer all the evil which was con&s;i&s;tent with his benevolence to his brethren, and the love to Chri&s;t implied in this: But this benevolence was incon&s;i&s;tent with his being really mi&s;erable; for he would be &s;o gratified in their &s;alvation by his means, and he &s;o placed his happine&s;s in this, that he mu&s;t be in a great degree hap|py, much more &s;o than he could be in any po&s;&s;ible enjoyment, which he &s;hould have, at the expence of their &s;alvation, or while de&s;titute of this benevolence.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible this &s;en&s;e of the words is mo&s;t contrary to all <HI>&s;elfi&s;h re|ligion</HI>; but it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with that charity, that di&s;inter|e&s;ted benevolence, which '&s;eeketh not her own,' but the profit of many, that they may be &s;aved; without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to be a true follower of Chri&s;t,</P></NOTE></P>

He never would have done this, had it not been for the love he had to God, and regard for his glory. What rea&s;on then has the &s;inner to thank him, for doing it out of love to him? Certainly if he was chiefly influenced in this by love to God, his regard to man had but a pro|portionably &s;mall influence in this affair.'</P>
<P>The &s;olution is, the benevolence which Chri&s;t exerci|&s;ed towards God, and towards men, is one undivided af|fection. The glory of God, and the &s;alvation of men by Chri&s;t, are not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, as different objects of pur&s;uit.

In this he placed his happi|ne&s;s and joy. This was the great end he &s;ought in endu|ring the cro&s;s, this was the joy that was &s;et before him. Therefore he was &s;o far from plea&s;ing or &s;eeking him|&s;elf in this, that the reward he &s;ought was the object of di&s;intere&s;ted affection, and nothing el&s;e. His benevo|lence &s;et this up as a good, for the &s;ake of which he was willing to give up his life, and &s;uffer an ignominious death.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. Chri&s;t's own honor and intere&s;t is included in the glory of God, and the greate&s;t good of the crea|tion. As God, his own glory is the &s;ame with the glory of the Father: As man, his intere&s;t is great, as well as of infinite importance to the good of the whole. There|fore, as has been &s;hewn, di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, or love to God and men, implies a regard to him&s;elf, and a joy in his own happine&s;s and glory. There is not the lea&s;t degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in this; but 'tis e&s;&s;ential to di&s;inte|re&s;ted benevolence.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We may learn what is the nature of true holine&s;s from what Chri&s;t &s;ays to his di&s;ciples: 'Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy; but I &s;ay unto you, love your e|nemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you,&mdash;that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good.&mdash;For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the Publicans
<PB N="55" REF="012811_0063_0F8AC04C925C0708">
the &s;ame?&mdash;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.' <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 43&mdash;48.</NOTE></P>
<P>On this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture we may ob&s;erve the fol|lowing things:</P>
<P N="1">1. What our Saviour here condemns is <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> which had been, by the Jewi&s;h teachers, ju&s;tified and in|culcated, as true holine&s;s, and obedience to the divine law, requiring us to love our neighbour as our&s;elves. By our neighbour, they under&s;tood one who is kind to us, and our hearty friend. And our enemy they di&s;tingui&s;hed from neighbour, and put in oppo&s;ition to him, and taught that the latter is to be hated, that it is our duty to do &s;o, and the former loved. This interpretation made the command very ea&s;y indeed, and brought it down to &s;uit the heart of the mo&s;t wicked man on earth. And all the &s;elfi&s;h religion that is taught now is as agreeable to corrupt nature, as this was then; which leads me to ob|&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t condemns this, and enjoins directly the con|trary, even the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted good will, in loving our wor&s;t enemy, with that kind, benevolent affection, which will lead us to do him all the good in our power.</P>
<P N="3">3. He &s;hews that this &s;elfi&s;h love has nothing of the nature of true holine&s;s, by ob&s;erving that &s;inners, even the wor&s;t of them, exerci&s;ed &s;uch love. They love tho&s;e that love them; for &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s it&s;elf will do this. And by the way, Chri&s;t not only condemns &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s here, as no part of holine&s;s, and in oppo&s;ition to it; but his ar|gument &s;uppo&s;es that Publicans and &s;inners, yea, all that are not the children of God, are wholly de&s;titute of holi|ne&s;s; for if they were not, his argument would not be conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P N="4">4. Therefore love to enemies is here enjoined as e&s;|&s;ential to the character of a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t; &s;o that no love which does not imply this di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, or love to enemies, is the love in which holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts,
<PB N="56" REF="012811_0064_0F8AC04D469F05C8">
by which the true di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t are di&s;tingui&s;hed from others; every thing el&s;e, which does not imply this, being found with &s;inners. According to this, di&s;inte|re&s;ted benevolence, or that love which will extend to ene|mies, is the holy love which di&s;tingui&s;hes the true di&s;ci|ples of Chri&s;t from all others, and nothing will pa&s;s for true holine&s;s in Chri&s;t's account, but &s;uch love, and what is implied in it.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is by &s;uch love alone that they are conformed to God, and formed after the likene&s;s of his moral per|fection or holine&s;s. When Chri&s;t tells his di&s;ciples, that by loving their enemies, they &s;hould be the children of their Father which is in heaven, i. e, imitators or follow|ers of God as dear children, it is implied that they could become &s;o by nothing el&s;e. So that in this view, this kind of love is repre&s;ented as the only holy love, as 'tis the only love by which they imitate God. And it hence follows al&s;o, that this is the love in which the divine ho|line&s;s con&s;i&s;ts: For if it con&s;i&s;ted in any thing of another kind, which this did not imply, they might be like God without love to their enemies. According to this repre|&s;entation, God's holine&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts in love to him&s;elf and his creatures, is &s;uch, that it carries in its nature love to enemies; and therefore that love which is not of &s;uch a nature, is not true holine&s;s. Therefore the chri&s;tian's love to God and Chri&s;t is of the &s;ame nature with love to enemies, which is di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence; and in this his holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P N="6">6. We may al&s;o ob&s;erve from this pa&s;&s;age, though 'tis not immediately to the point we are upon, that the holy love by which chri&s;tians are di&s;tingui&s;hed from others, will love God even though he were our enemy; therefore it is not nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould &s;ee him to be our friend, or that he loves us, in order to our loving him. They who hold this, and that all true love to God is of this kind, teach a &s;elfi&s;h religion, directly contrary to what Chri&s;t taught, and which he &s;aid publicans and &s;inners might
<PB N="57" REF="012811_0065_0F8AC05136C80C40">
have as well as chri&s;tians. If we cannot be Chri&s;t's di&s;|ciples, unle&s;s we have a heart to love our enemies, even &s;uch as are &s;o unju&s;tly, and are doing us all the injury they can; then none are his di&s;ciples who have not a heart to love God, even though he is their enemy, and di&s;po&s;ed to cur&s;e and de&s;troy them; who cannot be an unju&s;t and injurious enemy. Surely that di&s;po&s;ition which will love an enemy, who is unju&s;tly and injuriou&s;ly &s;o, will not find it hard to love an enemy, who is &s;o with the high|e&s;t rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. And all true love to God is of this kind; it is &s;uch a generous, di&s;intere&s;ted, benevolent af|fection, that it is &s;o far from originating from a belief of his love to us, that we &s;hould continue to love him, even though he appeared to be our enemy; and that love which would fail in this ca&s;e, is not true holine&s;s. Therefore it is certain, that he who does not love his enemies, does not love God with a true holy love. This is, at lea&s;t, implicitly a&s;&s;erted here by our Saviour.</P>
<P N="5">V. That all true holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;intere&s;ted, be|nevolent affection, and what is implied in this, is evident from what St. Paul &s;ays, 1 Cor. xiii. Here the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of charity as compri&s;ing all real holine&s;s, or true religion; by which he means that love to God and our neighbour, which the law of God requires. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word in the original &s;ignifies <HI>love,</HI> and ought to have been &s;o tran&s;lated here, as it is above an hundred times in the new-te&s;ta|ment.</NOTE></P>
<P>He &s;ays, whatever gifts and attainments a man may have, which may be without this love, he is &s;till nothing, and they will be no profit to him. And whatever exer|ci&s;es he has, and whatever he may do or &s;uffer, and not have this love, he is yet nothing; by which it is very &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted, that love is true holine&s;s, and that no|thing el&s;e has any thing of this nature. In giving the character of this holy love in its exerci&s;es, he &s;ays, IT SEEKETH NOT HER OWN. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 5.</NOTE> This a&s;certains the nature of
<PB N="58" REF="012811_0066_0F8AC052D53C6AA8">
this love beyond di&s;pute. It is not &s;elf-love, in whole or in part; for this always &s;eeks it's own, and nothing el&s;e. Yea, 'tis &s;et in oppo&s;ition to &s;elf-love, it SEEKETH NOT her own. Nothing can an&s;wer to this de&s;cription but that di&s;intere&s;ted affection which con&s;i&s;ts in benevo|lence, and what is implied in it; and this an&s;wers to it exactly. It is &s;o de&s;cribed here, that nothing el&s;e can be meant. Therefore the apo&s;tle exhorts chri&s;tians to exer|ci&s;e this &s;ame holy love in the following words, 'Let no man &s;eek his own: But every man another's wealth.' <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 24.</NOTE> Let no man &s;eek his own, i. e. <HI>as his own,</HI> in a &s;elfi&s;h way. All &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is wholly forbidden. Let him put on that holy love which &s;eeketh not her own; but &s;omething el&s;e, viz. the general good of all. This charity, this benevolent, di&s;intere&s;ted affection, is the only bond of holy union among intelligent beings, there|fore it is called the bond of perfectne&s;s,' i. e. the mo&s;t perfect bond. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Col. iii. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P N="6">VI. The words of St. Paul, 'Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God,' <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 31.</NOTE> might he mentioned here as pointing out the nature of holine&s;s, as exerci&s;ed towards God. It is &s;uch a love to God, which implies and con&s;i&s;ts in &s;eeking his glory con&s;tantly in every action. But nothing but benevolence will do this. It is &s;trange that any &s;hould think good will is not to be exerci&s;ed towards God, when we are in every thing to &s;eek his glory; for the lea&s;t reflection on the matter, mu&s;t convince every one, that nothing but good will, or friendly affection towards God, will &s;eek his glory, or care any thing about it. This is to be con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed towards God; &s;o as in the &s;trength of it to devote our &s;elves, every action, all we are, and all we have, to his intere&s;t and glory. And this is to exerci&s;e kind, di&s;intere&s;ted affection towards God; in which we give up every other intere&s;t, for the &s;ake of his glory.</P>

<P N="8">VIII. Scripture holine&s;s is that by which men devote and con&s;ecrate them&s;elves to God, to be wholly for his u&s;e and &s;ervice.

<P>This will lead us to place holine&s;s in that univer&s;al be|nevolence, which has the kingdom of God for its object, and &s;ubordinates all to this.

<P>ANS. 1. If the recompence of reward, that Mo&s;es had re&s;pect to, con&s;i&s;ted in being confirmed in God's &s;ervice and favour forever, and put under the greate&s;t advanta|ges to glorify God, and promote the intere&s;t of his church, and in &s;eeing this accompli&s;hed to the highe&s;t degree; then there was nothing &s;elfi&s;h in this, but it was the genu|ine exerci&s;e of that di&s;intere&s;ted religion, which con&s;i&s;ts in love to God and our neighbour. The di&s;intere&s;ted, benevolent per&s;on &s;eeks a recompence of reward, as much as any other per&s;on can, and more; but 'tis a reward with which benevolence it&s;elf is well plea&s;ed, and not &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s. Selfi&s;hne&s;s never &s;eeks the reward which God gives his people; this is &s;uited to gratify benevolence on|ly:
<PB N="61" REF="012811_0069_0F8AC054D2D59820">
Therefore it is re&s;pected and &s;ought only in the exer|ci&s;e of benevolence.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. It has been ob&s;erved, that the benevolent per|&s;on &s;eeks his own highe&s;t good, as this is included in the highe&s;t good of the whole; and that his attention and concern is more particularly turned to this intere&s;t, as 'tis more in his view, and is more e&s;pecially under his care, and he is under better advantages to promote it, than the intere&s;t of another. Therefore it is no argument of &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s in Mo&s;es, or any other man, that he has re&s;pect to his own future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>OBJ. II. The promi&s;es and threatenings in God's word are all directed to &s;elf-love. They &s;uppo&s;e that all men have &s;elf-love, and are &s;uited to influence this, and nothing el&s;e. If a per&s;on has nothing but di&s;intere&s;ted affection, promi&s;es &amp; threatenings will be of no u&s;e to him. If men ought not to have any &s;elf-love, why does God addre&s;s him&s;elf to that in his word, and &s;eek to lead men to avoid &s;in, and practi&s;e holine&s;s, in the exerci&s;e of &s;elf-love?</P>
<P>ANS. 1. The promi&s;es and threatenings in the word of God, &s;uppo&s;e men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a de&s;ire after happine&s;s, with an aver&s;ion to evil, and a regard for their own inte|re&s;t, an&s;werable to its worth. This is &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted affection, that it is implied in it, as has been proved at large.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> Therefore promi&s;es of good, and threatenings of evil, are as much &s;uited to influence the benevolent per&s;on, as him that is &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. The good promi&s;ed is a good which benevo|lence &s;eeks, and it has the mo&s;t perfect aver&s;ion to the e|vil threatened; and the benevolent per&s;on has a much more clear and realizing view and &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s and de&s;irablene&s;s of the good, and the dreadfulne&s;s of the evil, than the &s;elfi&s;h per&s;on can have. This being &s;o, the promi&s;es and threatenings in the bible are &s;o far from &s;up|po&s;ing that men ought to regard them from &s;elf-love, or
<PB N="62" REF="012811_0070_0F8AC055895D0C88">
that there is any &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in true religion, that their pro|per end is an&s;wered only in them who are influenced by di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence; and &s;uch only pay a proper re|gard to them. The &s;elfi&s;h per&s;on may be influenced many ways, and to a great degree, by the threatenings and pro|mi&s;es in God's word: They may excite high hopes and great fears, and re&s;train him from many things he would otherwi&s;e practice, and lead him to do many things; but they will not influence him to for&s;ake &s;in, and practice ho|line&s;s, or to love God and his neighbour; but after all, he is as much under the power of &s;in as ever.</P>
<P>And it is to be ob&s;erved, that the promi&s;es are not made to &s;elfi&s;h exerci&s;es and doings; and therefore, rightly un|der&s;tood, are not &s;uited to encourage &s;elf-love, but bene|volence. All the promi&s;es &amp; threatenings in the bible op|po&s;e &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &amp; are calculated to de&s;troy it, &amp; encourage di&s;intere&s;ted affection, love to God and our neighbour, &s;o far are they from encouraging &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t promi&s;es honor and exaltation to them who hum|ble them&s;elves. Should any one hence infer, that this promi&s;e was de&s;igned to encourage pride in &s;eeking exal|tation and honor, and that pride is a duty, he would be guilty of great ab&s;urdity and &s;elf-contradiction; for this would be &s;aying, a man ought to exerci&s;e pride in &s;eeking humility; and that Chri&s;t has &s;et before us a motive to excite pride, in order to induce us to be humble. This promi&s;e is &s;o far from encouraging pride, that it tends to de&s;troy it. The honor and exaltation promi&s;ed, is not that which pride &s;eeks, but that which is mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to it. And &s;hould a proud man be hence influenced by his pride, to &s;eek humility, he might put on &s;ome exter|nal appearances of it; but he would be as far as ever from real humility, for by the &s;uppo&s;ition, all his exerci|&s;es are exerci&s;es of pride; and humility is not the object of his de&s;ire, but of his aver&s;ion. This may &s;erve to il|lu&s;trate the ca&s;e before us, and &s;hew how far the divine promi&s;es are from being &s;uited to encourage pride and
<PB N="63" REF="012811_0071_0F8AC056479AF9C8">
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; and that they encourage nothing but benevo|lence. And it al&s;o leads to another an&s;wer.</P>
<P>ANS. 3. The great and chief good which is promi&s;ed in the word of God, is not a good that plea&s;es &s;elfi&s;h per|&s;ons, and therefore is not de&s;igned nor &s;uited to excite &s;elf-love. As the duties to which the promi&s;es are made, are contrary to &s;elf-love; &s;o is the chief good that is promi&s;ed. The honor and exaltation promi&s;ed to humility, are as contrary to pride, as is humility it&s;elf. The honor which the proud man &s;eeks, is not the &s;ame which Chri&s;t promi&s;es to him who humbleth him&s;elf; but entirely of a different nature, and contrary to it. A per|&s;on who humbles him&s;elf, renounces that &s;elf-exaltation and honor, in compari&s;on with other beings, which pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s &s;eek; and places his honor and happine&s;s in aba&s;ing him&s;elf, &amp; becoming the &s;ervant of all, by ex|alting God, and promoting his glory, and &s;erving his fellow-creatures; mini&s;tring to their greate&s;t good, in the exerci&s;e of univer&s;al benevolence; and &s;o obtains true exaltation and honor, which is mo&s;t contrary to &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s and pride. So the happine&s;s in general, which is the &s;ubject of divine promi&s;es, is not a happine&s;s which &s;uits &s;elf-love, nor can it be induced to de&s;ire and &s;eek it. This is a happine&s;s which con&s;i&s;ts in glorifying God and promoting the intere&s;t of his kingdom: In devoting our|&s;elves wholly to this; and &s;eeing it promoted to the highe&s;t degree. This good is therefore ju&s;t as con|trary to &s;elf-love, as is univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted benevo|lence. This good is &s;uited to plea&s;e the benevolent, and excite them to pur&s;ue the practice of holine&s;s, and &s;eek this glory, honor and happine&s;s; but to &s;elf-love, is the object of aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>If the&s;e things are well con&s;idered, it will appear how groundle&s;s this objection is. If the benevolent per|&s;on is as capable of being influenced by promi&s;es and threatenings, as any one el&s;e, and much more; and the&s;e are &s;uited to animate him in the practice
<PB N="64" REF="012811_0072_0F8AC0571A7F2078">
of di&s;intere&s;ted, univer&s;al benevolence and goodne&s;s.&mdash; If the promi&s;es and threatenings in the bible are, in a peculiar manner, &s;uited to encourage and promote benevolence.&mdash;If neither the duty to which the pro|mi&s;es are made, nor the chief good promi&s;ed, is agreeable to &s;elf-love, nor can be cho&s;en and embraced by it: Then there being &s;o many promi&s;es &amp; threatenings in the bible, is not the lea&s;t evidence that true religion does not con&s;i&s;t in di&s;intere&s;ted affection, or that &s;elf-love is any part of it. But the contrary appears with &s;trong and ir|re&s;i&s;tible evidence, even from the&s;e con&s;iderations,&mdash;</P>

There is not &s;uch a difference and oppo&s;i|tion between what is called benevolence and &s;elf-love, as has been &s;uppo&s;ed; nor is there any &s;uch thing as <HI>di&s;|intere&s;ted</HI> benevolence; men are &s;eeking their own happi|ne&s;s in all their affections and exerci&s;es. He that &s;eeks the good of another, does it becau&s;e he takes plea&s;ure in it; and he &s;eeks his own plea&s;ure and happine&s;s as much as he who &s;eeks his own per&s;onal good only; and the one is as much &s;elf-love as the other, And men are friendly to one thing rather than another, becau&s;e one gives them plea&s;ure, and the other does not: So that &s;elf-love is at the bottom of all; and one man is really as &s;elf-fi&s;h as another; all the difference is, one man's &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s operates in a different way from that of another man: All love &s;prings from &s;elf-love, and cannot be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from it.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. If by &s;elf-love the objector means a general appetite to happine&s;s, and aver&s;ion to mi&s;ery, or a capa|city of plea&s;ure and pain; 'tis granted that this takes place in benevolence, as much as in &s;elf-love. But, as has been &s;hewn, this is in it&s;elf neither &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, nor di&s;|intere&s;ted affection; but only a capacity for either.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. 'Tis true that di&s;intere&s;ted affection gives a higher plea&s;ure and enjoyment than &s;elf-love; and there|fore 'tis greatly for a per&s;on's intere&s;t to place his happi|ne&s;s in the glory of God, and the intere&s;t of his kingdom,
<PB N="65" REF="012811_0073_0F8AC057C74753B8">
and the greate&s;t good of mankind: But it does not hence follow, that the plea&s;ure to be enjoyed in loving God and our neighbour is the cau&s;e of this love, or the inducement to a &s;elfi&s;h per&s;on to love God, in order to an&s;wer a &s;elfi&s;h end, and make him&s;elf happy. I &s;ay, this does not follow, for two rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="1">1. This is to put the cau&s;e for the effect, and the effect for the cau&s;e. The ground and rea&s;on of a per&s;on's tak|ing plea&s;ure in the happine&s;s of his neighbour, is his di&s;intere&s;ted good will to him; and not this plea&s;ure the cau&s;e of his good will to his neighbour. But the objector &s;uppo&s;es the latter, viz. that the plea&s;ure a per&s;on has in benevolence is the cau&s;e of his loving his neighbour, which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a contradiction in &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;elf-love will lead a per&s;on to place his happine&s;s in his neighbour's good; for the latter &s;tands in direct contra|diction to the former. Selfi&s;hne&s;s is directly oppo&s;ed to a per&s;on's placing his happine&s;s in the good of ano|ther: This con&s;i&s;ts in an oppo&s;ite affection, which &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s cannot be reconciled to. Nor can the &s;elfi&s;h per&s;on &s;o much as have an idea of the enjoyment which attends benevolence; and therefore 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that the hap|pine&s;s benevolence gives, &s;hould be a prevailing motive with him, to love and &s;eek the happine&s;s of another, that he may hereby make him&s;elf happy.</P>
<P>If one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that becau&s;e exaltation and honor is the certain attendant of humility, this will induce a proud man, in the exerci&s;e of his pride, to be humble, for the &s;ake of the honor he will obtain by it; and therefore that pride &amp; humility are at bottom the &s;ame thing, &amp; &s;eek the &s;ame honor, the &s;uppo&s;ition would be as con&s;i&s;tent and rational, as that we are con&s;idering.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on places his happine&s; in the good of his neigh|bour, it may be a&s;ked, how came he to do this, rather than another; &amp; by what medium does he enjoy this plea&s;ure? The an&s;wer mu&s;t be this; the former is a friend to his neigh|bour,
<PB N="66" REF="012811_0074_0F8AC05891B29BF0">
and this gives him plea&s;ure in his happine&s;s: Whereas the latter is not his friend, and bears no good will to him, but regards his own intere&s;t only, and there|fore cannot take plea&s;ure in his neighbour's good. The character of the&s;e two men are e&s;&s;entially different; their exerci&s;es are of a different and oppo&s;ite nature; the latter is a lover of his own &s;elf only; the former loves his neigh|bour as him&s;elf, and is &s;o united to him, in di&s;intere&s;ted good will, that he nece&s;&s;arily &s;hares in his happine&s;s. In this ca&s;e he does not love his neighbour, in order to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his happine&s;s, this is not the motive of his benevolence; for this is a contradiction. It is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his neighbour's happine&s;s in this way, &amp; from this motive, for &s;o far as he acts from &s;uch a motive, he, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, cares nothing about it, and it is no happine&s;s to him. Nothing but di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence will give him a &s;hare in his neighbour's good; this is the ground and cau&s;e of his enjoying it, and not a de&s;ire of enjoying this happine&s;s the ground of his benevolence. So far as a man de&s;ires to enjoy his neighbour's happine&s;s from &s;elf-love, ju&s;t &s;o far he is incapable of enjoying it. The more he de&s;ires it therefore, in this &s;en&s;e, the further he is from it.</P>
<P>ANS. 3. Di&s;intere&s;ted good will, which puts a man in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his neighbour's happine&s;s, al&s;o makes him &s;hare in his mi&s;ery, if he is mi&s;erable, and bear his bur|dens. But this is mo&s;t contrary to &s;elf-love; therefore it is oppo&s;ed to benevolence. If &s;elf-love would lead a per&s;on to take plea&s;ure in his neighbour's happine&s;s, and &s;hare in his good, and this were po&s;&s;ible; it would not certainly, de&s;ire to &s;hare in his mi&s;ery, and &s;o put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that too. But benevolence does this, there|fore 'tis not &s;elf-love, nor the fruit and offspring of it; but an affection of a different and oppo&s;ite nature.</P>
<P>OBJ. IV. Holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, in part, in hatred of &s;in; therefore it does not wholly con&s;i&s;t in love; for hatred is oppo&s;ite to love.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="012811_0075_0F8AC05947BB3B98">ANS. Hatred of &s;in is not oppo&s;ed to the love of be|nevolence; for we may love them who are mo&s;t vile and odious, with a love of good will, and are commanded to do it. And God loved &s;inners with the greate&s;t benevo|lence, while they were mo&s;t odious to him, and hated them with a perfect hatred of di&s;approbation and di&s;plicence. Thus we may, and are obliged to love and hate the &s;ame per&s;ons at the &s;ame time, in many in&s;tances, to love them with a love of good will, and yet hate them with a hatred of di&s;plicence.</P>
<P>Nor is this di&s;plicence, and hatred of &s;in, oppo&s;ed to the love of complacence, &s;o as to imply any thing of a con|trary nature. Hatred of &s;in is implied in all holy love; and that affection which takes complacence in holine&s;s, is exerci&s;ed in the hatred of &s;in; it being in its nature one and the &s;ame thing, exerci&s;ed towards different objects. Love to God is, in its nature, di&s;plea&s;ure at enmity a|gain&s;t him; and nece&s;&s;arily hates tho&s;e who hate him; not with the hatred of ill will, but of di&s;approbation and di&s;plicence.</P>

<P N="1">I. FROM the view that has been given of holine&s;s, we are led to ob&s;erve the impropriety many have been guilty of in &s;peaking of holy, chri&s;tian love, as con&s;i&s;t|ing chiefly, if not wholly, in love of complacence. It has been very common, where love to God, and love to our brother is &s;poken of and explained, very much, if not wholly, to overlook the love of benevolence, and keep the love of complacence chiefly or altogether in view. This is not agreeable to &s;cripture, which I tru&s;t appears
<PB N="68" REF="012811_0076_0F8AC05A08E8F1E0">
from what has been &s;aid. The love of benevolence is chief|ly kept in view there, as what comprehends the whole of holy love; and we cannot have, or communicate a proper notion of holine&s;s, if we depart from the holy &s;cripture in this particular. This has doubtle&s;s been the occa&s;ion of great confu&s;ion, and many mi&s;takes.</P>
<P N="2">II. We may hence learn what true <HI>&s;elf-denial</HI> is, and in what it con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Our Lord teaches us, that in becoming his di&s;ciple, a man mu&s;t deny him&s;elf: That there is no other way to be a chri&s;tian; and this mu&s;t be practi&s;ed in every &s;tep in which men follow him, 'If any man will come after me, let him <HI>deny him&s;elf,</HI> and take up his cro&s;s daily, and follow me.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. ix. 23.</NOTE> This &s;elf-denial con&s;i&s;ts, mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially in acting contrary to &s;elf-love, in cro&s;&s;ing that, &amp; giving up the intere&s;t that it &s;eeks, for the &s;ake of &s;ome other intere&s;t; or in giving up our own private, per&s;onal intere&s;t, for the &s;ake of the glory of God, &amp; the greate&s;t good of mankind; which is the &s;ame with exerci&s;ing di&s;intere&s;ted affection; or to love God with all our heart, &amp; our neighbour as our&s;elves. Self-denial con&s;i&s;ts in the exerci&s;e and practice of true ho|line&s;s, as it has been de&s;cribed above, and in nothing el&s;e; in which &s;elf is renounced, &amp; men for&s;ake the whole intere&s;t which &s;elf-love &s;eeks, for the &s;ake of the kingdom of God. Whatever men do or &s;uffer, whatever they give up, for the &s;ake of this, they deny them&s;elves; and where there is no thing of this di&s;intere&s;ted love exerci&s;ed, there is no &s;elf-denial, whatever is done or &s;uffered; as &s;elf is not in the lea&s;t renounced. Chri&s;t him&s;elf is the mo&s;t perfect example of &s;elf-denial; which con&s;i&s;ted in &s;eek|ing not his own glory, but the glory of the Father, and the greate&s;t good of the creation, in promoting the king|dom of God, the whole of which is expre&s;&s;ed by the a|po&s;tle in the following words, 'For even Chri&s;t <HI>plea&s;ed not him&s;elf.</HI>'</P>
<P>Self-denial does not therefore con&s;i&s;t meerly in cro&s;&s;ing
<PB N="69" REF="012811_0077_0F8AC05C0DD8EFE8">
our natural inclinations, in parting with that which is ve|ry dear to us, or going through great toil and &s;ufferings, to obtain &s;ome end. When this is done, not for our own &s;ake, or from &s;elf-love; but for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, or for the &s;ake of the kingdom of God, it is true &s;elf-denial. But when it is done for our own &s;akes wholly, there is no &s;elf-denial in it. The mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h creature in the world may part with one good for the &s;ake of another, by which he greatly cro&s;&s;es &s;ome of his inclinations and appetites; and may go through great labour and &s;ufferings, purely to plea&s;e him&s;elf, or gratify his &s;elf-love. Thus a man may give up his ea&s;e, and practice hard &s;ervice and toil, throughout a whole year, for the &s;ake of the wages he is to receive, while he is wholly &s;elfi&s;h in what he does and &s;uffers, having no regard to any other intere&s;t but his own.

<P>A man may give all his goods to the poor, and devote his whole life to the mo&s;t &s;evere di&s;cipline, and practice the greate&s;t au&s;terities imaginable; and then give his body to be burned, with a view to e&s;cape hell, and ob|tain heaven; and yet if he has not that charity which &s;eeketh not her own, but does and &s;uffers all wholly under the influence of &s;elf-love, there is no true &s;elf-denial in it; but it is as really &s;elf-gratification, and plea&s;ing him&s;elf, as if he indulged his &s;en&s;ual appetites in riot and wanton|ne&s;s; and there is really no more true religion in it. For there is no more true holine&s;s in de&s;iring and &s;eeking eternal happine&s;s in a &s;elfi&s;h way, and from &s;elf-love, than there is in de&s;iring any temporal, worldly enjoyment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of this &s;ort, we have rea&s;on to think, are all the ab&s;tinences, fa&s;tings, prayers, whippings and au&s;terities, as well as giving large &s;ums of money, practi&s;ed by multitudes in the popi&s;h world, for the &s;ake of obtaining the heaven they have in view.

<P><PB N="70" REF="012811_0078_0F8AC05CDAE33D60">But here two que&s;tions ari&s;e, which may be worthy of particular con&s;ideration, as it may &s;erve to throw &s;ome further light on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>QUEST. I. Do per&s;ons give up their <HI>eternal intere&s;t</HI> in &s;elf-denial, &s;o as not to have a &s;elfi&s;h regard to this in their religious exerci&s;es? 'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee that per&s;ons may and ought to give up their own private, temporal intere&s;t, in many in&s;tances, at lea&s;t, and to a great degree, for the &s;ake of others, and to promote the greater general good. &mdash;But is it not unrea&s;onable, and even impo&s;&s;ible, for them to di&s;regard and give up their own <HI>eternal intere&s;t,</HI> for the &s;ake of others, or for any thing what&s;oever?&mdash;</P>
<P>ANS. 1. Whatever temporal good any one gives up for the &s;ake of his own eternal intere&s;t, and wholly from &s;elf-love, he is, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, as &s;elfi&s;h in this, as he can be in any thing what&s;oever; and therefore there is no &s;elf-denial in it, if &s;elf-denial is acting contrary to &s;elf, or denying our&s;elves. So that he who does not know how to deny him&s;elf with re&s;pect to his eternal intere&s;t, is really a &s;tranger to &s;elf-denial. To give up our temporal, worldly intere&s;t, for the &s;ake of eternal happine&s;s, wholly under the influence of &s;elf-love, is as real an in&s;tance of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, as parting with all we have now, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a large e&s;tate the next year. Therefore, if no per&s;on can renounce his eternal intere&s;t, in opppo&s;ition to a &s;elfi&s;h regard to it, there is no &s;uch thing in nature as &s;elf-denial, or public, di&s;intere&s;ted affection. But let it be kept in mind, that in the practice of the greate&s;t &s;elf-denial, a per|&s;on does not dive&s;t him&s;elf of a love of happine&s;s; for this is impo&s;&s;ible, as has been &s;hewn, as well as contrary
<PB N="71" REF="012811_0079_0F8AC05EE013C6D8">
to the &s;uppo&s;ition. But he places his happine&s;s, not in his own private intere&s;t; but in a good more worthy to be &s;ought, viz. the glory of God, and the pro&s;perity of his church and kingdom. For the &s;ake of this, he gives up the former, and forgets him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. There is the &s;ame rea&s;on why &s;elf-love &s;hould be wholly cro&s;&s;ed, in every in&s;tance, as there is that it &s;hould be cro&s;&s;ed at all; &s;o the &s;ame rea&s;on that our whole intere&s;t, &s;o far as 'tis the object of &s;elf-love, &s;hould be gi|ven up, for the &s;ake of an intere&s;t of un&s;peakable more worth.</P>
<P>True benevolence always &s;eeks the greate&s;t good of the whole; and is a di&s;po&s;ition to give up the le&s;s good for the greater. That affection which he&s;itates at this, and makes any &s;elfi&s;h conditions, is private affection, not public love. If benevolence will lead us to for&s;ake our per&s;onal intere&s;t, in any degree, it will lead us to for&s;ake it <HI>wholly,</HI> for the greater good of others, if it is exerci&s;ed to a &s;ufficient degree, and there is nothing &s;elfi&s;h in us to counter-act and oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider what GOD is, how infinitely great, important and de&s;irable, and of what infinite worth are his being, happine&s;s and glory; and how infinitely worthy and excellent he is: What an ab&s;olute and infinite right he has to us, and to all creatures, to di&s;po&s;e of them as he &s;ees fit, in his infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, for his own happine&s;s and glory, and for the greate&s;t glory and happine&s;s of his kingdom: I &s;ay, if we well con&s;ider this, it mu&s;t appear mo&s;t fit and rea&s;onable, that we &s;hould love him above all, and without any re&s;erve, i. e. with all our hearts, &amp;c. and give up our&s;elves <HI>wholly</HI> to him, to be for his u&s;e, that his ends may be an&s;wered by us; and he be, in the highe&s;t degree, ble&s;&s;ed, and glori|fied, and his kingdom mo&s;t happy and glorious forever, let what will become of us, and without making any conditions with regard to our&s;elves. Therefore it be|comes us always to feel &s;o towards GOD, and place our

whole happine&s;s in his felicity and glory; having in this &s;en&s;e, no will of our own. But this is denying our&s;elves, and giving up the whole of our own intere&s;t for his &s;ake. A choo&s;ing to be wholly devoted to him, and to be and do every thing wholly for his &s;ake, is to choo&s;e to do no|thing for our own &s;akes; which is to give up the whole that &s;elf-love &s;eeks.</P>
<P>If we make conditions in this ca&s;e, and are willing that God &s;hould be &s;upreme, and have the whole di&s;po|&s;al of us, and glorify him&s;elf by us, IF he will &s;ecure our highe&s;t per&s;onal intere&s;t, and employ all his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in our behalf; but are di&s;po&s;ed to oppo&s;e this, on any other condition; there is no di&s;intere&s;ted affection to God in this, nor indeed any true love to him; nor is there any &s;elf-denial in it: Yea, it is it&s;elf real oppo&s;ition to God; and the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h creature, and the greate&s;t enemy to God in the univer&s;e, may be brought to this, con&s;i&s;tent with all his &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and enmity.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, as has been &s;hewn, that the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted affection does not exclude proper regard to our own being and intere&s;t; but nece&s;&s;arily includes it: But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that if our own per&s;onal intere&s;t is incon&s;i&s;tent with the general good; univer&s;al benevo|lence will give it all up, for the &s;ake of this greater good; for to be unwilling to give up our own intere&s;t, when the public good requires it, is criminal &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and enmi|ty to being in general; and therefore enmity again&s;t God.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on for which I &s;hall be willing that the intere&s;t of any individual in the univer&s;e &s;hould not be regarded, but given up, when incon&s;i&s;tent with the ge|neral good, I &s;hall be willing to give up my own intere&s;t, on the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition, if I am governed by benevolence. Therefore, however great and important is our whole in|tere&s;t, temporal and eternal, we ought to be willing to give it all up, if it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the highe&s;t intere&s;t&punc; the greate&s;t glory of HIM who is at the head of the uni|ver&s;e,
<PB N="73" REF="012811_0081_0F8AC064DA4EF470">
and the &s;um of all being and perfection; and true benevolence will do this; &s;ince the latter intere&s;t is infi|nitely greater, and more important than the former, and that not worthy of any regard, in compari&s;on with this.</P>
<P>But this leads to another que&s;tion.</P>
<P>QUEST. II. How can our eternal intere&s;t be incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the greate&s;t di&s;play of God's glory, and the high|e&s;t intere&s;t of his kingdom? Are not the&s;e &s;o united to|gether, that they cannot be &s;eparated; how than can the former be given up, for the &s;ake of the latter?&mdash;</P>
<P>ANS. If we know that we are true chri&s;tians, we may be &s;ure that 'tis for the glory of God, and good of the whole, that we &s;hould be eternally happy in his kingdom. But even in this ca&s;e, we are capable of making the &s;up|po&s;ition that it would not be &s;o; and, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, we &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to give up all our per&s;onal intere&s;t, &s;o far as we are in the exerci&s;e of di&s;intere&s;ted affection, and willing to deny our&s;elves.&mdash;But if we do not know that we have embraced the go&s;pel, we cannot be &s;ure that 'tis, on the whole, mo&s;t for the honor of God, and the glory and happine&s;s of his kingdom, that our eternal hap|pine&s;s &s;hould be &s;ecured: So we have opportunity to try how we &s;hall feel, and be di&s;po&s;ed, on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition. In this ca&s;e, the language of &s;upreme love to God will be to this purpo&s;e: 'Let infinite wi&s;dom dictate. Let GOD reign, and di&s;po&s;e of me and all creatures, &s;o as &s;hall be mo&s;t for his own glory, and the greate&s;t good of the whole, whatever becomes of me, and my intere&s;t.' In this ca&s;e, not to have infinite wi&s;dom order; not to have GOD &s;upreme, and di&s;po&s;e as plea&s;es him, &s;o as to glorify him&s;elf in the highe&s;t degree, and make his kingdom mo&s;t perfect and happy, would be a greater evil, infinite|ly greater, to the true friend of God and his kingdom, than the giving up his own per&s;onal intere&s;t: Yea, on &s;uppo&s;ition his own intere&s;t and highe&s;t happine&s;s is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the glory of God, it will be worth nothing, and wor&s;e than nothing to him. He will therefore &s;ay

with Mo&s;es, 'Blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book.' If God may not be God, and order all things for his own glory, and the greate&s;t good of his kingdom; and if my &s;alvation is incon&s;i&s;tent with this, I give all up, I have no intere&s;t of my own to &s;eek or de&s;ire.</P>
<P>It is true, he who has &s;uch di&s;intere&s;ted, benevolent ex|erci&s;es, mu&s;t be happy &s;o long as God reigns, and is glo|rified, and his kingdom is in the highe&s;t degree advanced; beau&s;e this, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, is become his good, or he places his happine&s;s in this.

<P>QUEST. III. How can we in any ca&s;e give up our own eternal intere&s;t for God's &s;ake, and for the intere&s;t of his kingdom, &s;ince by devoting our&s;elves to God, we take the mo&s;t &s;ure and the only way to &s;ecure and promote our own highe&s;t good, in our eternal &s;alvation: Is there not an incon&s;i&s;tence in this?</P>
<P>ANS. Though a per&s;on by giving him&s;elf to God is the exerci&s;e of di&s;intere&s;ted affection, in this way denying him&s;elf for God's &s;ake, does indeed take the mo&s;t direct and effectual way to true happine&s;s, and to &s;ecure and promote his highe&s;t intere&s;t: Yet he as really gives it up for God's &s;ake, as if he did not &s;ecure and promote it in this way. And he does as truly deny him&s;elf, as if he did really and eternally loo&s;e his whole intere&s;t.&mdash;There|fore it does not hence follow that he is &s;elfi&s;h, and &s;eek his own private intere&s;t in giving him&s;elf to God, and lov|ing God more than him&s;elf: For this is a contradiction being the &s;ame as to &s;ay, he is &s;elfi&s;h, and loves him&s;elf more than God, in renouncing &s;elf, and loving God more than him&s;elf, and doing all for God's &s;ake.</P>

<P N="3">III. What has been &s;aid of the nature of holine&s;s, will help us to di&s;tingui&s;h between true religion, and that which is fal&s;e. The leading and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference lies here: True religion con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;intere&s;ted affection, and '&s;eeketh not her own:' Fal&s;e religion wholly con|&s;i&s;ts in &s;elfi&s;h affections and exerci&s;es. The former is true holine&s;s; the latter is nothing but &s;in.</P>
<P>This will &s;erve as a touch-&s;tone, by which we may try the various doctrines and &s;chemes of religion, which are embraced and contended for by profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians. If they are the dictates of univer&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, and &s;uited to plea&s;e and promote this, they are doctrines according to godline&s;s. But if they are &s;uited to gratify &s;elf-love only, and formed on a &s;elfi&s;h plan, they have no foundation in &s;cripture.</P>
<P>There are many who profe&s;&s;edly make &s;elf-love the foundation of all religion, &amp; repre&s;ent it as wholly a &s;elf|i&s;h thing, from beginning to end. They do &s;o, who teach that love to God, and all practical religion has its founda|tion

wholly in a belief that God loves us, and has for|given our &s;ins; and that the faith by which the ju&s;t do live, con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially in this belief. And this &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s is involved in the &s;cheme of religion that many others embrace. The <HI>five points,</HI> &s;o long di&s;puted be|tween calvini&s;ts and arminians, being examined by this criterion, it will appear, I doubt not, on which &s;ide the truth lies. The latter form a &s;cheme of doctrines exactly &s;uited to gratify the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and pride of man; to ex|alt men, at the expence of the honor of God, and hap|pine&s;s and glory of his kingdom. That of the former is &s;uited to exalt God, and di&s;play the glory of his grace, in the happine&s;s and glory of his moral kingdom; and therefore is mo&s;t agreeable to the dictates of univer&s;al be|nevolence. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The doctrines here referred to are, 1. God's decrees. 2. O|riginal &s;in. 3. Man's moral impotency. 4. Ju&s;tification by faith through imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s. 5. The per&s;everance of the &s;aints. Calvini&s;ts take the po&s;itive &s;ide. Arminians the negative.</NOTE> He who&s;e head and heart are truly formed upon this di&s;intere&s;ted, benevolent plan, will not find it difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e doctrines which are the dictates of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and pride; and &s;uch as are &s;uited to exalt God, and aba&s;e man, and &s;et up the glory of God, and his kingdom, as the &s;upreme end of all: And will cordially embrace the latter, and renounce the for|mer.</P>
<P>And this will help us to a rule to <HI>try the &s;pirits</HI> of men, &s;o far as we are to judge of their hearts by their practice. A man appears to have true religion, who em|braces the doctrines which are <HI>according to godline&s;s,</HI> and appears to be devoted to the honor of God, and the re|deemer, and the advancement of his intere&s;t and king|dom in the world; for which he is at all times ready to &s;pend, and be &s;pent.

It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that a kind, benevo|lent &s;pirit, exerci&s;ed towards men; e&s;pecially the &s;aints, in doing them good, is much &s;poken of in &s;cripture, as an evidence of true re|ligion And the rea&s;on of this appears from the foregoing account of true holine&s;s.</NOTE> And if a per&s;on appears in his life and conver&s;ation to be wholly &s;elfi&s;h and proud; &s;eeking his own ea&s;e, plea&s;ure and honor, rather than the honor of Chri&s;t, and the promotion of his kingdom, and the good of mankind; whatever doctrines he pro&s;e&s;&s;es to embrace, and however full of religious zeal and devotion, he may appear to be at times, we have rea&s;on to conclude he is a &s;tranger to true religion.</P>
<P>And by this rule every one may try his own religion.

<P>ANS. What is a&s;&s;erted here is, that God's love is fir&s;t in the affair. Had he not fir&s;t loved us, and given his &s;on to die for us, and then called us by his grace, and given us a heart to love him, we had con|tinued enemies to him. This is the plain &s;en&s;e of the words, and is agreeable to innumerable other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture. Whereas the other &s;en&s;e is quite forced, and makes the words &s;ay what they do not. They are not, we love him becau&s;e <HI>we fir&s;t believed</HI> he loved us. Be|&s;ides, &s;uch a &s;en&s;e is contrary to the whole run of &s;cripture, and the expre&s;s declaration of our Lord, who &s;ays, there is no true religion in &s;uch love. See page 55, 56, 57, of the inquiry. And it is contrary to the whole bible, in another view. According to &s;cripture, we can have no evidence of our intere&s;t in God's &s;pecial love, and pardoning mercy, until we believe and embrace the go&s;pel; and love to God or what implies it, is the only evidence we can have that God loves us. It is therefore impo&s;&s;ible, on good grounds, to believe God loves us with a de&s;ign to &s;ave us, before we love him.

They there|fore who believed God loved them, while they had no love to him, and have begun to love God wholly upon this belief, have believed a lie, in the face of the whole bible: And all their religion is nothing but delu&s;ion.</P></NOTE> He who comes to the knowledge of the truth

And it now becomes his &s;tudy and labour, to promote this grand intere&s;t, by &s;erving God &amp; his generation; and thus he &s;eeks fir&s;t the kingdom of God.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Mr. Hart's objections again&s;t Mr. Edwards's making true virtue to con&s;i&s;t <HI>primarily</HI> in benevolence, which has uni|ver&s;al being for its <HI>primary</HI> object, con&s;idered and an|&s;wered.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Edwards, in his di&s;&s;ertation on the nature of true virtue, has &s;aid it con&s;i&s;ts <HI>primarily</HI> in benevo|lence; and that the <HI>primary</HI> or fir&s;t object of univer&s;al benevolence is being &s;imply con&s;idered, or being in ge|neral, agreeable to the repre&s;entation in the foregoing in|quiry.&mdash;To this Mr. Hart objects two things.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He &s;ays, that as being &s;imply con&s;idered, or be|ing in general, is neither God nor the creature, but an ab|&s;tract idea, love to this object is not commanded; for we are commanded to love God and our neighbour only. According to Mr. Edwards, there ought to be another, and a fir&s;t command to love being in general. But as we find no &s;uch command, we may be &s;ure there is no &s;uch duty, and that holine&s;s does not at all con&s;i&s;t in &s;uch love. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Remarks on Edwards, p. 5, 6.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="012811_0090_0F8AC06C05B964A0">ANS. Love to being in general, is obedience to the law of God, commanding us to love God and our fellow-creatures; for the&s;e are being in general, and compre|hend the whole of being. He who does not exerci&s;e uni|ver&s;al benevolence, does not obey the fir&s;t, nor the &s;econd command: But he who loves being, as &s;uch, or &s;imply con&s;idered, which is the &s;ame as being in general, (and 'tis evident Mr Edwards u&s;es the&s;e terms as &s;ynonimous) I &s;ay, he who loves being in general, loves God and his fellow creatures; and therefore obeys the two great com|mands.</P>
<P>OBJ. 'This is no an&s;wer,' &s;ays Mr. H. 'According to this notion of the root, or fir&s;t principle of true virtue, love to God, as well as to our neighbour, is the off|&s;pring of this general, indeterminate benevolence.' And if it is fit to command or require the daughter affection, much more the mother love. p. 6.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. If being in general was &s;omething di&s;tinct from God and the creature, and more than the&s;e, and not included in them, the objection would appear to have &s;ome foundation: But as the ca&s;e is, it is wholly ground|le&s;s. If a particular member of a community or nation, &s;hould be commanded to love the king, and all his fellow-&s;ubjects; and he &s;hould be told, this love mu&s;t be primarily, good will to all in general, and not to any in|dividuals, exclu&s;ive of the re&s;t; would he have any rea|&s;on to &s;ay, this was not included in the command he had received; and that he was not by this bound to exer|ci&s;e this good will to the whole nation, as &s;uch: Becau&s;e he was to love only the king and his fellow-&s;ubjects? That the whole nation, &s;imply con&s;idered as &s;uch, or the nation in general, including king and &s;ubjects, was only 'an ab&s;tract idea,' including neither king, nor his &s;ub|jects; but &s;omething el&s;e, which he mu&s;t love <HI>fir&s;t</HI>; and then from this 'mother affection' 'the daughter love' mu&s;t &s;low, viz. love to the king and to his fellow-&s;ubjects?
<PB N="83" REF="012811_0091_0F8AC06CD8326988">
If not, what Mr. Hart has &s;aid, is not rea&s;on|able.&mdash;</P>
<P>ANS. 2. It will more fully appear how frivolous this objection is, if we con&s;ider <HI>in what &s;en&s;e</HI> being in general is the primary object of true benevolence. It means no more than that true benevolence is of the nature of love to being in general. This is fundamental and original in its nature; &s;o that it cannot, from its very nature, be limited to any particular &s;ort or circle of beings; but for the &s;ame rea&s;on it loves one, it loves all. Therefore it regards individuals, and is exerci&s;ed toward them, not in a limited, confined &s;en&s;e, but as part of the whole. In this view, it appears that love to God may be an affec|tion which has being in general for its object; and its true nature, by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from every thing el&s;e, may con&s;i&s;t in this; and yet there be no exerci&s;e of heart towards being in general, antecedent to love to God, of which love to God is the fruit and offspring. All that is a&s;&s;erted is, that this true love to God, is a di&s;|po&s;ition to love being in general; and carries this in its very nature, el&s;e it would not be true benevolence. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the preceding inquiry, p. 11, 12.</NOTE> And where is the ground of repre&s;enting love to being in general, as the 'mother affection,' and love to God and our neighbour as 'the daughter love,' when the matter is viewed in this light?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Mr. Hart objects, that Mr. Edwards, by making being in general the primary object of holy love, &s;ets this up as &s;upreme, and makes an idol of it, to which the fir&s;t and &s;upreme regard is to be paid; while nothing but a &s;econdary, &s;ubordinate, inferior affection is left for God.</P>
<P>ANS. When it is &s;aid that being in general is the pri|mary or fir&s;t object of benevolent love, the meaning is, that this affection in its primary quality and di&s;tingui&s;h|ing nature has being in general, as &s;uch, for its object; and is a di&s;po&s;ition to regard all, and not a part only;
<PB N="84" REF="012811_0092_0F8AC06D87E77000">
and that being in general is its <HI>fir&s;t</HI> object, in di&s;tinction from benevolent being, which is a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> object of be|nevolence, and the primary object of complacence. This is not only con&s;i&s;tent with God's being the chief and &s;u|preme object of this affection; but he is &s;o <HI>nece&s;&s;arily,</HI> as Mr. Edwards has ob&s;erved and proved in his &s;econd chapter.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards took care to guard again&s;t both the&s;e objections of Mr. Hart's in the following words.
<Q>When I &s;ay, true virtue con&s;i&s;ts in love to being in general, I &s;hall not be likely to be under&s;tood, that no one act of the mind, or exerci&s;e of love, is of the nature of true virtue, but what has being in general, or the great &s;y|&s;tem of univer&s;al exi&s;tence for its direct and immediate object; &s;o that no exerci&s;e of love, or kind affection to any one particular being, that is but a &s;mall part of the whole, has any thing of the nature of true virtue: But that the <HI>nature</HI> of true virtue con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>di&s;po&s;ition to benevolence</HI> towards being in general.</Q>
<Q>My meaning is, that no affections towards particular per&s;ons or beings is of the nature of true virtue, but &s;uch as ari&s;es from a generally benevolent temper, or from that habit or frame of mind, wherein con&s;i&s;ts a di&s;po&s;ition to love be|ing in general.</Q>
p. 118, 119.</P>
<P>What can be plainer than this? According to this a per&s;on may love God &s;upremely, with a love which has not univer&s;al exi&s;tence for its direct and immediate object (only as God is in a &s;en&s;e univer&s;al exi&s;tence) but God may be as much the fir&s;t, direct, and immediate object, in all re&s;pects, as if there were no other exi&s;tence; and yet this love carry in its nature, love to being, as &s;uch, or u|niver&s;al exi&s;tence, and this be the ground and rea&s;on why it fixes on God, as the &s;upreme object; and di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from every thing which is not holy love; for if it were not a love, which in its nature is love to being in ge|neral, it would not be true, holy love to God.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems Mr. Hart has under&s;tood Mr. Edwards,
<PB N="85" REF="012811_0093_0F8AC06E5453CBE0">
as he thought he &s;hould not be likely to be under&s;tood; and as he expre&s;sly declared he would not be under&s;tood. With how much rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, the reader mu&s;t judge.</P>
<P>Mr. Hart allows, that according to Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme, GOD may be the primary, chief and &s;upreme object of the love of complacence, p. 5, 8.</P>
<P>But let us con&s;ider whether there are not as many and great difficulties in this, as there are in making God the &s;upreme object of benevolence to being in general. This perhaps may give us &s;ome further light in this matter.</P>
<P>The love of complacence has beauty, or beautiful, ex|cellent being for its object. Hloy complacence has moral beauty in general, moral beauty as &s;uch, &s;imply con&s;i|dered, for its object; and not any particular beauty or the beauty of any particular being, as confined and limit|ed to that, and exclu&s;ive of moral beauty in general. It is exerci&s;ed towards particular beautiful beings, as &s;ha|ring in the beauty common to all holy beings, &amp; is love to moral beauty in general, as &s;uch: Or, in other words, it is love of holine&s;s, <HI>for holine&s;s &s;ake,</HI> &s;imply con&s;idered, as being what it is, in its own nature. Therefore love to particular holy beings, has its fir&s;t original and primary ground in love of holine&s;s in general, and is really in its own nature love of holine&s;s, as &s;uch, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all affection, which is not true love of holine&s;s.</P>

<P>Mr. H. will doubtle&s;s acknowledge that God may be the &s;upreme object of the love of holine&s;s, as he is infi|nitely holy, and the fountain and &s;um of all holine&s;s; and that he mu&s;t be &s;o, to him who loves holine&s;s in ge|neral, or for its own &s;ake, &s;imply con&s;idered: Though he might not be the &s;upreme object of any other kind of love which has not holine&s;s, as &s;uch, for its primary object. And why mu&s;t not this be as true of the love of benevo|lence, as Mr. Edwards has defined it?</P>
<P>Mr. H. u&s;es the following argument to prove that God cannot be the &s;upreme object of the benevolence Mr. Edwards de&s;cribes. p. 7.</P>
<P><Q>Upon Mr. Edwards's principles, the ab&s;olutely great being mu&s;t have an incomparably greater &s;hare of the primary benevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered, than all other particular beings. Compared with them, he has chief and &s;upreme benevolent regard: But not &s;o, compared with the primary object of virtuous love, viz. being in general. That mu&s;t be the chief object; for the great being does not exhau&s;t all being, &s;o as to reduce all others to non-exi&s;tence, or no degree of be|ing. He infinitely outweighs all other beings, as put in the &s;cale again&s;t him. But if his infinite degree of being is put into one &s;cale, and the &s;ame be put into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, and together with that, the degrees of exi&s;tence of all other beings, 'tis obvious this great be|ing's weight, in the oppo&s;ite &s;cales, will balance it&s;elf, and the whole weight of the other beings will remain clear, and turn the &s;cale. This &s;cale has in it the whole of the primary object of virtuous love, the other not; and the virtuous attraction, or tendency of primary be|nevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered, is in proportion to the quantity of being.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="012811_0095_0F8AC0716D471080">Every one mu&s;t &s;ee, at fir&s;t view, that if this argument proves God cannot be the &s;upreme object of univer|&s;al benevolence, it equally proves he cannot be the &s;u|preme object of any love and regard, in which the crea|ture has the lea&s;t &s;hare: And that the heart which has any regard to the creation, cannot pay &s;upreme regard to God. But I will now apply it to the love of complacence in particular, by &s;ub&s;tituting that in room of benevo|lence; by which it will appear this argument will prove, if it proves any thing, that God cannot be the &s;upreme object of complacence.</P>
<P><Q>Upon Mr. Edward's principles, (and in the ca&s;e be|fore us, we may &s;ay, upon Mr. Hart's too) 'the ab&s;o|lutely great being mu&s;t have an incomparably greater &s;hare of the <HI>love of holine&s;s for holine&s;s &s;ake, or the love of moral beauty in general,</HI> &s;imply con&s;idered; than all other particular beings.

To who&s;e metaphy&s;ics, Mr. Edwards's or Mr. Hart's, this exclamation is mo&s;t properly applicable, the judicious reader, I &s;uppo&s;e, will be at no lo&s;s. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be u&s;ele&s;s, perhaps, to ob&s;erve here, that as being in general is the primary object of general benevolence, &amp; benevolent being a &s;econdary object, as has been ob&s;erved; &s;o there is a di&s;tinction to be made in the object of complacential love, into primary and &s;econdary, in &s;ome mea&s;ure analogus to that of benevolence. The primary ob|ject of complacence, is that holine&s;s and beauty which con&s;i&s;ts in pure benevolence, and a &s;econdary object is the holy complacence it|&s;elf. It mu&s;t be evident to any one who will attend, that this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e; for there mu&s;t be complacence, before there can be any delight in complacence, or complacential love of complacence; therefore the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> complacence cannot have complacence, or love of holine&s;s for its object; but the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> love of holine&s;s mu&s;t be the love of holy benevolence. And when this complacence in benevolence once exi&s;ts, it does it&s;elf become an object of complacence, and in this &s;en&s;e is a &s;econdary object of complacential love; it being a &s;econdary beau|ty, implied in benevolence and flowing from it. And indeed, the mind cannot have any true conception of the love of holine&s;s, or ho|ly complacential love, until it actually takes place in the mind; and therefore the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> exerci&s;e of it in every mind, cannot have the love of complacence for its object; but it mu&s;t be the beauty of bene|volence. The mind in this way getting an idea of the beauty of com|placential love, immediately takes delight in it, or approves of it as an excellence, which is a &s;econdary and con&s;equential exerci&s;e of com|placence towards this &s;econdary object. The ca&s;e &s;eems to be plain|ly this. The fir&s;t exerci&s;e of holine&s;s is benevolence to being, as &s;uch; in which the heart is di&s;po&s;ed to unite it&s;elf to being in gene|ral, in &s;eeking the highe&s;t univer&s;al good. And this general bene|volence implies in it benevolence to benevolent beings, and a di&s;po&s;i|tion to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> benevolence, with a love of complacence. And the be|nevolent mind, being thus plea&s;ed with benevolence as the greate&s;t beauty and excellence, is of cour&s;e in the next place plea&s;ed with this beautiful complacence in benevolence.</P>
<P>Of this holy love, in all its branches, and exerci&s;es, GOD is in a true &s;en&s;e the fir&s;t and &s;upreme object, as he is the &s;um of all being; &s;o that all created exi&s;tence, in compari&s;on with him, &s;inks into no|thing. And he is the &s;um and fountain of all benevolent being, and of complacence in moral beauty; or of all excellence and moral beau|ty and perfection And his exi&s;tence and relations to his creatures, in which he is infinitely di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other beings, are the ground of peculiar exerci&s;es of the benevolent mind towards him: &s;uch as holy fear and reverence; a humble tru&s;t and re&s;t and joy in him, as the &s;upreme good, &amp; a &s;weet acquie&s;cence in him, &amp; in his government and works, and re&s;ignation to him &amp;c all which is implied in bene|volence, even in its very nature; and is nothing but univer&s;al benevo|lence acting according to its nature, towards this infinitely great and glorious object.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>IT may not be improper to take notice here, of the ob|jection Mr. H. makes again&s;t Mr. Edwards's &s;peak|ing of any affection to God, under the name of BENEVO|LENCE.

<P>Mr. Edwards has taken particular notice of this ob|jection, and an&s;wered it, p. 126, 127. Mr. Hart, or his friend, had no right to renew this very objection again&s;t

Mr. Edwards, without taking notice of his an&s;wer, and &s;hewing wherein his rea&s;oning fails; which neither of them have attempted.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t none will deny that any affection exerci&s;ed to|wards God has the nature of good will to him; but if we are to exerci&s;e any good will towards God, and be in any degree his friends, we mu&s;t &s;o far exerci&s;e benevolence towards him; for <HI>good will</HI> and <HI>benevolence</HI> are two names of the &s;ame thing.

Why this &s;ame af|fection may not be called by the &s;ame name, when exerci|&s;ed towards a &s;uperior, and one that is above all depend|ence on us, as well as when exerci&s;ed towards an inferior and dependent, no man, I believe, can &s;hew. If benevo|lence implies indigence, and dependence in the object to|wards which it is exerci&s;ed, it would indeed be improper and irreverent, to call any affection exerci&s;ed towards God by this name. And I conclude this gentleman, and all others who make this objection, have affixed this idea to the word benevolence; and that this is the ground of their di&s;gu&s;t. But in this they are very arbitrary; in affixing a meaning to the word which it does not expre&s;s, nor was ever de&s;igned to &s;ignify.</P>
<P>Mr. H. allows that God is the fir&s;t object of his own benevolence, p. 18. If God exerci&s;es benevolence to|wards him&s;elf, why may not his creatures? Yea, why <HI>mu&s;t</HI> they not? In the exerci&s;e of holine&s;s they imitate God as dear children, and are partakers of the divine na|ture. Their love to God then mu&s;t be of the &s;ame na|ture with God's love of him&s;elf, and if his is a love of benevolence, theirs mu&s;t be &s;o too. And why God's love of him&s;elf may be called benevolence, which Mr. H. ventures to do, and yet the &s;ame kind of love of God in the creature may not be called &s;o, is quite unaccounta|ble.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="012811_0099_0F8AC079EA623840">Be&s;ides, Mr. H. makes all virtue &s;ummarily to con&s;i&s;t in 'giving up all incon&s;i&s;tent intere&s;ts, as lo&s;s <HI>for God's &s;ake,</HI> &amp; his kingom's.' p. 33.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Mr. Hart's objections again&s;t Mr. Edwards's notion of the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> or <HI>natural beauty</HI> in virtue, con&s;idered and obviated.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Edwards ob&s;erves, there are two kinds of beau|ty. One is <HI>moral beauty,</HI> or the beauty of true virtue or holine&s;s; which is the highe&s;t kind of beauty, and con&s;i&s;ts in cordial agreement and harmony, or general benevolence; and is di&s;cerned and approved of, by &s;uch only, who love true holine&s;s; which love is it&s;elf the ex|erci&s;e of holine&s;s. The other is <HI>natural beauty,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in natural harmony or agreement, &amp;c. and takes place in the natural and material world, in num|berle&s;s in&s;tances. And this &s;ame kind of beauty is found in things immaterial and mental, as well as in other things; and there is a natural beauty in virtuous exerci|&s;es
<PB N="92" REF="012811_0100_0F8DE13D454E5A48">
of the mind, and the fruit of tho&s;e exerci&s;es, which is entirely di&s;tinct from the moral, holy beauty, and of a different nature; even the &s;ame kind of beauty which is found in the material world. Thus there is a natural beauty, harmony &amp; agreement, in a man's doing to others as he would think proper they &s;hould do to him, of the &s;ame kind with the beauty and harmony of a building, the different parts of which are harmoniou&s;ly fitted to an&s;wer each other. Which beauty is di&s;tinct from that general benevolence, in which the truth of a man's doing to others as he would they &s;hould do to him con&s;i&s;ts, and which is the true moral beauty of the heart. This <HI>natural beauty</HI> is found in all virtuous exerci&s;es and conduct, e&s;pecially in relative duties between man and man, according to their different &s;tations &amp; relations; which may be reli&s;hed and delighted in by tho&s;e who have no virtue, as a ta&s;te for this natural beauty, is natural to all men, and does not imply di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, but is con&s;i&s;tent with the highe&s;t degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and &s;in. Therefore they have run into a great mi&s;take, who have thought this re|li&s;h for natural beauty, which is found in virtuous con|duct, which is common to all men, an evidence that all men have a degree of true virtue. [See Edwards's nature of true virtue, chap. III d. throughout.]</P>
<P>Mr. Hart objects again&s;t all this, as 'very injurious and de&s;tructive to true virtue.' And in order to expo&s;e it, he makes the following ob&s;ervations. chap. III d.</P>
<P>'1. If this doctrine is true. God's revealed law,&mdash;no where commands, recommends, or once mentions that in which all true virtue primarily and mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con|&s;i&s;ts; but only enjoins and commands it in regard to its &s;econdary beauty.' p. 16.</P>
<P>ANS. The law of God requires univer&s;al goodne&s;s or love, and nothing el&s;e; in which Mr. Edwards &s;ays all true virtue con&s;i&s;ts. This is &s;ufficiently illu&s;trated in the preceding inquiry; from which it appears this argu|ment is very ill cho&s;en indeed, to be u&s;ed again&s;t Mr.
<PB N="93" REF="012811_0101_0F8ABF8F9B953BC8">
Edwards's notion of virtue; and is nothing but begging the que&s;tion. Mr. H. &s;ays, 'If I mi&s;take not, Mr. Ed|wards does implicitly acknowledge this in what has been tran&s;cribed above.' <HI>An&s;.</HI> he is doubtle&s;s <HI>greatly mi&s;taken,</HI> and mu&s;t lie under this imputation, till he has particular|ly &s;hewn where and how this is implied in what Mr. Ed|wards has &s;aid. Mr. H. goes on,</P>
<P>'2. If this doctrine is true, it may be &s;u&s;pected that the holy men of old, prophets and apo&s;tles, never knew or practi&s;ed true virtue.'</P>
<P>ANS. Our Lord has told us that love to God and our neighbour is the whole of what the law and the prophets inculcated; even that &s;ame univer&s;al benevolence in which Mr. Edwards &s;ays all true virtue con&s;i&s;ts. We have therefore no more rea&s;on to <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> the prophets never knew or practi&s;ed this virtue, than we have to &s;u&s;pect that Chri&s;t was not a teacher come from God. And one of the chief apo&s;tles &s;aid, 'love is the fulfilling of the law;' and that all true religion and holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in this, and nothing el&s;e, 1 Cor. xiii. 2. He is therefore &s;o far from placing virtue in this <HI>&s;econdary beauty,</HI> that he expre&s;sly places it in &s;omething el&s;e, even in univer&s;al love and benevolence.</P>
<P>The in&s;tances in &s;cripture Mr. H. brings to &s;upport this ob&s;ervation, are not to his purpo&s;e, P&s;al. 18, 25.26. Rev. 16.5, 6. There is a true moral beauty in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God here celebrated, which con&s;i&s;ts in univer&s;al benevo|lence. Take this from that conduct which is called righ|teou&s;ne&s;s in God or man, and no moral goodne&s;s remains; &s;o nothing worthy of holy admiration and prai&s;e. There being a &s;econdary beauty, a natural fitne&s;s, in ju&s;tice, does not prove, or &s;uppo&s;e, there is no higher beauty and ex|cellence in it. If Mr. H. would prove the point he has &s;et up here, he mu&s;t produce an in&s;tance of virtue, re|commended and celebrated, as &s;uch, which has nothing in it of the nature of univer&s;al benevolence. In what he has yet &s;aid, he has only begged the que&s;tion. He proceeds,</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="012811_0102_0F8ABF904D9B3B08">'3. Let it be ob&s;erved that there is no &s;uch object of God's attention and regard, as being <HI>&s;imply con&s;idered.</HI>' p. 18.</P>
<P>ANS. There is &s;uch an object as being in general, or univer&s;al being, which is the &s;ame with <HI>being &s;imply con&s;i|dered,</HI> as Mr. Edwards u&s;es the terms. And univer&s;al benevolence has this for its object; &amp; that is not virtuous love which will not extend to being in general, as &s;uch, or &s;imply con&s;idered. This has been &s;ufficiently explained and evinced by Mr. Edwards, p. 129, 130, 131. and in the preceding inquiry, p. 11, 12.</P>
<P>Mr. H. to &s;upport his a&s;&s;ertion, goes on to &s;ay,
<Q>God is his own fir&s;t object. He &s;ees him&s;elf as he is, as po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ab&s;olute fulne&s;s of being, enriched and a|dorned with all po&s;&s;ible mental perfections. <HI>As &s;uch,</HI> he is the primary object of his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and chief love, both of benevolence and complacence.</Q></P>
<P>On this pa&s;&s;age I would ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is granted that 'God is his own fir&s;t object.' This Mr. Edwards grants, and has proved: And it has been &s;hewn in the foregoing &s;ection, that this is con&s;i&s;tent with virtue's con&s;i&s;ting in love to being in general; not only as God is, in effect, being in general; but his love of him&s;elf is, in its nature, love to being, as &s;uch, or being &s;imply con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="2">2. According to Mr. H's account of the matter here, God's love of benevolence and complacency, is no part of his excellence and perfections. God is 'enriched and adorned with ALL POSSIBLE mental perfections,' independ|ent of his love; and as thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>all po&s;&s;ible</HI> per|fections, 'he is the primary object of his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> love.' This is a bold &s;troke indeed! It &s;trikes out all love of bene|volence or complacence from being any part of holine&s;s. The &s;cripture &s;ays, 'God is love;' but according to Mr. H. no part of his perfection is expre&s;&s;ed in this, nor any thing worthy or excellent. And the law of God, which requires love, is no tran&s;cript or expre&s;&s;ion of the divine
<PB N="95" REF="012811_0103_0F8ABF911BCC60F8">
perfections; for the&s;e do not con&s;i&s;t, in the lea&s;t degree, in love, but in &s;omething entirely different from this. And if God's love to him&s;elf is no part of 'all po&s;&s;ible per|fection,' he having all po&s;&s;ible perfection antecedent to this; then his love of benevolence and complacence to|wards his creatures is no part of his holine&s;s and perfecti|on. And it will al&s;o follow, that love of benevolence and complacence in creatures, the angels for in&s;tance, is no part of their moral excellence. Thus we &s;ee where Mr. H. is carried in his oppo&s;ition to Mr. Edwards's account of true virtue. This was no inadvertence in Mr. H. No one can do better than he has done on this head, if he &s;ets up to oppo&s;e general benevolence to being, as &s;uch, as the foundation and &s;um of all holine&s;s: It will nece&s;&s;arily land him in this fir&s;t-born of ab&s;urdities, and he can give no better account of the divine holine&s;s and perfections than Mr H. has here given. M. H. has the &s;ame &s;enti|ment, in the following extraordinary &s;entence, p. 12.
<Q>He [GOD] is not virtuous and holy <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he loves him&s;elf; but he loves him&s;elf <HI>becau&s;e he is holy.</HI></Q>
That is, God's holine&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in love, but &s;omething which is antecedent to all love, and the ground and object of it; and is therefore quite a di&s;tinct thing from love.</P>
<P>Mr. H. may be a&s;ked, what this holine&s;s is, and where|in it it con&s;i&s;ts? What are '<HI>all po&s;&s;ible</HI> mental perfec|tions,' in which there is no degree, no kind of love? Doubtle&s;s he will be as much puzzled for an an&s;wer, as the Indian he mentions, who a&s;&s;erted the earth &s;tood on a tortoi&s;e; and being a&s;ked what the tortoi&s;e &s;tood upon? 'He cried out, with &s;urpri&s;e, <HI>Me don't know</HI>!' p. 23.</P>
<P>Perhaps Mr. H. thinks he has an&s;wered this que&s;tion, in his chap. <HI>of the e&s;&s;ential nature of true virtue.</HI> but if I can under&s;tand him there, what he &s;ays of the divine ho|line&s;s and perfection is in direct oppo&s;ition to this extra|ordinary a&s;&s;ertion, and very con&s;i&s;tent with Mr. Edwards. He repre&s;ents God's holine&s;s as con&s;i&s;ting in <HI>an equitable regard to him&s;elf, and his creatures.</HI> This may be benevo|lence
<PB N="96" REF="012811_0104_0F8ABF91CFDD10D0">
to being in general, notwith&s;tanding any thing he &s;ays. Yea, I think it mu&s;t be this, according to his own account of the matter, when all he &s;ays upon it is put to|gether. He &s;peaks of 'an e&s;tabli&s;hed virtuou&s;ne&s;s of character' in the creature, as conformity to God him&s;elf; and he &s;ays this con&s;i&s;ts in love; p. 43. and that it is in effect <HI>univer&s;al love.</HI> p. 47. Now what can univer&s;al love be, but love to being in general? And if this is virtue in the creature, by which he is conformed to God's moral character, then God's holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in this &s;ame <HI>univer|&s;al love,</HI> or love to being in general. But, be this as it may, it is certain Mr. H. makes the holine&s;s of God to con&s;i&s;t in part, if not wholly, in <HI>love.</HI> What can God's equitable regard to him&s;elf be, but love to him&s;elf? Let him tell who can.</P>
<P>Moreover, he &s;peaks of the love &amp; goodne&s;s of God, as a 'mo&s;t virtuous' [or holy] propen&s;ity; p. 43. and as that which is <HI>his glory.</HI> p. 44, 45. Now, if God's love, his benevolence and goodne&s;s, are his holine&s;s, and his glory, how can it be that he is 'enriched and adorned with <HI>all po&s;&s;ible</HI> mental perfections,' antecedent to his love to him|&s;elf, &amp; as the ground of it; and antecedent to his love to his creatures? This love cannot be any part of his per|fection, holine&s;s and glory, if he is 'adorned with <HI>all po&s;|&s;ible perfections</HI>' antecedent to it. Thus we &s;ee Mr. Hart has been &s;o far from telling us what <HI>all po&s;&s;ible perfection</HI> is, con&s;idered as a&s;ide from love, and the ground and ob|ject of it, that he has contradicted this his po&s;ition, and placed the moral perfection and holine&s;s of God in love, and nothing el&s;e. 'Error is fated to run crooked!'</P>
<P>Mr. H. proceeds to &s;ay, p. 19.</P>
<P N="4"><Q>4. Let us next con&s;ider the de&s;tructive influence of this notion of virtue, upon virtue it&s;elf. All relative duties which we owe to God, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and our fellow-&s;ervants,&mdash;partake of the nature of ju&s;tice: They are equitable, fit and right in their own nature: They have a natural agreement and harmonious propor|tionablene&s;s
<PB N="97" REF="012811_0105_0F8ABF92D2039E38">
to the nature and characters of their re&s;pec|tive objects.&mdash;All this you &s;ee and approve, and the di&s;|po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of your mind or heart towards all the&s;e relative duties, are natural, harmoniou&s;ly pro|portionable to them, and in concord with them, equita|bly &s;uited to them. Your heart then is very beautiful, but not at all virtuous, if the&s;e harmonious and equita|ble di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of your mind do not ari&s;e from pure benevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered. So then the beauty of your mind, as adorned with all the&s;e relative, equitable and harmonious di&s;po&s;itions <HI>only,</HI> is of the &s;ame &s;ort with that of bodies. Your heart is as beautiful as a &s;quare or a cube, and no more virtuous than they.</Q></P>
<P>On this the following things may be ob&s;erved, 1. There is, in things of a moral nature, a natural beauty, which con&s;i&s;ts in harmony and agreement, &amp;c. which is di&s;tinct from any thing properly moral in them; and therefore a beauty which is di&s;tinct from moral beauty, and of a different nature. This Mr. Edwards has a&s;&s;ert|ed, illu&s;trated and proved: And I do not find that Mr. Hart has &s;o much as attempted to &s;hew wherein his proof fails, and how what he &s;ays is not to the purpo&s;e. All Mr. H. attempts to do, is to draw ab&s;urd con&s;equences from this notion of &s;econdary, natural beauty in moral things; which con&s;i&s;t in begging the que&s;tion, or a&s;&s;ertions without any manner of proof. Some of which have been con&s;ider|ed; or in mi&s;repre&s;enting Mr. Edwards' doctrine on this head: Of which the words before us are an in&s;tance, as I &s;hall &s;hew before I have done.</P>
<P>There is a uniformity and proportion and an an&s;wera|blene&s;s of one thing to another, in moral things or true virtue, which is of the &s;ame kind with the uniformity, &amp;c. which takes place in the material world, and the &s;ame ta&s;te which di&s;cerns and takes plea&s;ure in the latter, will do the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the former. And therefore this ta&s;te and plea&s;ure don't imply love of virtue; for it
<PB N="98" REF="012811_0106_0F8ABF93560CAF10">
is not the virtue it&s;elf that is di&s;cerned and reli&s;hed; and if there was nothing there but what is di&s;cerned and reli&s;h|ed by this ta&s;te, there would be no virtue in it. This is what Mr. Edwards has a&s;&s;erted, and Mr. H. has &s;aid nothing to prove it is not &s;o: Nor will he ever do it, it is pre&s;umed. It is a truth which every con&s;iderate, judicious per&s;on mu&s;t di&s;cern; Mr. H. him&s;elf not ex|cepted; for <HI>he</HI> has acknowledged it, as I &s;hall &s;hew pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>A per&s;on wholly &s;elfi&s;h may be plea&s;ed with &s;ome things which attend general benevolence; there is to him a beauty in it, &s;o far as he has advantage by it. This may be while he &s;ees nothing of the true beauty of benevolence. Saul, under the influence of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;aw a beauty in David's conduct, in &s;paring his life when he was in his hands, and was highly delighted with it, while he wholly overlooked the true beauty of it, and the virtue he exerci&s;ed, and had no plea&s;ure in it, but would have been di&s;plea&s;ed with the &s;ame conduct in David, had it been towards one of Saul's enemies. It is granted that in this ca&s;e, the beau|ty &s;een, and Saul's plea&s;ure in David's conduct, are not wholly of the &s;ame kind with that under con&s;ideration, as the former has its foundation chieflly in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, the latter not; yet, I think it &s;erves to illu&s;trate the ca&s;e be|fore us, and &s;hew that men may &s;ee a beauty in virtuous conduct, and be plea&s;ed with it; and yet not &s;ee the true beauty of virtue, or have any regard to the true virtue which is exerci&s;ed; but be di&s;po&s;ed to be di&s;plea&s;ed with that, and hate it.</P>
<P>The ju&s;t proportion and &s;ymmetry of a beautiful pic|ture is adju&s;ted and marked out by a number of exactly proportioned lines, drawn &s;o as in a certain manner to agree with each other, and form a proper uniformity. Now the&s;e lines, thus exactly drawn and proportioned, form a beauty different from that which we call the beauty of a picture, or a human face, which con&s;i&s;ts in a certain &s;ym|metry and ju&s;t proportion. An accurate mathematician,
<PB N="99" REF="012811_0107_0F8ABF95678A15E8">
who has no ta&s;te or di&s;cerning of what is meant by the beauty of a picture, which is formed by certain colours and &s;hades, proportioned to the&s;e lines; yet might di&s;cern the ju&s;t proportion of the&s;e lines, exactly drawn to &s;uit and an&s;wer each other, &s;ee a beauty in it, and be plea&s;ed. Here we &s;ee there are two di&s;tinct beauties, the one inferi|or, the other higher, the latter the true beauty of a pic|ture; and yet the former is di&s;cerned, and not the latter. And why may it not be &s;o in the ca&s;e before us; tho' the beauties, one of an inferior, the other of a higher kind, have a different and greater di&s;tinction, than in this in|&s;tance? The exact proportion and harmony in the vibra|tions of the chords of a mu&s;ical in&s;trument, have a beauty in them that would give plea&s;ure, if clearly di&s;cerned, di&s;tinct from the harmony of a tune; and he who has no ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, might di&s;cern the harmony and exact proportion of the&s;e vibrations, and be plea&s;ed with this beauty.</P>
<P>Mr. H. in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that what Mr. Edwards calls the &s;econdary beauty that attends true virtue, &amp; &s;ays is the &s;ame kind with natural beauty, is true virtue, and all the beauty there is in it. This &s;eems to be at the bottom of all he has &s;aid again&s;t Mr. Edwards on this head. He might, &s;o far as I can &s;ee, with ju&s;t as much rea&s;on &s;ay, all the beauty of a beautiful picture con&s;i&s;ts in the exact proportion of a number of lines: Or that the whole of the beauty and &s;weet harmony of mu&s;ic, con&s;i&s;ts in the exact, harmonious, corre&s;pondent vibrations of the air, or of the chords of a mu&s;ical in&s;trument. He &s;ays,
<Q>The truth is, this marvellous &s;cheme has changed the natural, moral beauty and glory of true virtue, into an image made like to the beauty of an equilateral triangle, or a che&s;s|board.</Q>
p&middot; 21.</P>
<P>That he had no rea&s;on to bring this charge again&s;t Mr. Edwards, any one mu&s;t &s;ee at fir&s;t glance. Mr. Ed|wards &s;ays virtue does not con&s;i&s;t in this &s;econdary beau|ty; but in &s;omething el&s;e of quite a different nature and kind; that though there is a beauty which con&s;i&s;ts in
<PB N="100" REF="012811_0108_0F8ABF958CC05FB0">
proportion, and the an&s;werablene&s;s of one thing with ano|ther, that attends true virtue, which is of the &s;ame kind with the proportion and beauty of a triangle or che&s;s|board; yet this is of a nature entirely different from virtue, and has nothing of its beauty and glory. What more could Mr. Edwards have done utterly to exclude the beauty of a che&s;s-board, &amp;c. from the beauty and glory of true virtue? This was the de&s;ign of this chap|ter on &s;econdary beauty. But may not this charge, with great ju&s;tice and propriety, be retorted on Mr. Hart him|&s;elf? he in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that this &s;econdary beauty, which Mr. Edwards has proved to be like to the beauty of ma|terial things (and Mr. H. has not &s;hewn that it is not &s;o) is all the beauty and glory there is in true virtue. This charge mu&s;t lie upon him till he can prove the beauty at|tending true virtue, which Mr. Edwards calls natural, &s;e|condary beauty, is not a beauty of the &s;ame kind with the beauty in material things. This leads me to another ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a mi&s;repre&s;entation in this pa&s;&s;age. Mr. H. here &s;uppo&s;es that all relative duties to God, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &amp;c. may be practi&s;ed from the heart, according to Mr. Edwards, without the exerci&s;e of true virtue;
<Q>and the di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of the mind or heart to|wards all the objects of the&s;e relative duties be natural, harmoniou&s;ly proportionable to them, &amp; in concord with them, equitably &s;uited to them, and <HI>the heart</HI> be thus 'very beautiful; but not at all virtuous.</Q>
This is a gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation. Mr. Edwards &s;peaks of this &s;e|condary beauty as the attendant of true virtue, which does not take place in the mind that is de&s;titute of virtue. He allows of no di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of heart, harmo|niou&s;ly proportionable and equitably &s;uitable to the ob|jects of relative duties, in the mind de&s;titute of true vir|tue, or general benevolence, and which are not the exer|ci&s;es of that. And in this mi&s;repre&s;entation Mr. H. real|ly begs the que&s;tion in di&s;pute, or takes for granted what
<PB N="101" REF="012811_0109_0F8ABF9646E4DCB0">
he had to prove, viz. that a man may <HI>heartily</HI> practice all relative duties towards God and his neighbour, while he has no univer&s;al benevolence. If he had proved this, which he has taken for granted, and Mr. Edwards had allowed what he &s;uppo&s;es, viz. that the mind may have all the beauty which he &s;uppo&s;es in relative duties, without any true virtue, 'the de&s;tructive influence of his notion of virtue, upon virtue it&s;elf,' might have appeared. But as the ca&s;e &s;tands, nothing of this kind is made to ap|pear.</P>
<P>Mr. H. goes into the &s;ame way of arguing (if it can be called arguing) in another pa&s;&s;age which I will tran|&s;cribe. After having made a quotation from Mr. Ed|wards, in which he &s;uppo&s;es, what he had abundantly proved, viz. that there is a natural beauty accompany|ing true virtue, in which true virtue does not con&s;i&s;t, but is of the &s;ame kind with the natural beauty in mate|rial things, he cries out, 'Wonderful!' And then goes on in the following words,
<Q>Here an appeal is made to experience, and the argument is built on this &s;uppo&s;i|tion, that moral proportion and harmony is a beauty of the &s;ame kind with that of material things.</Q>
Here is a mi&s;repre&s;entation. Mr. Edwards does not a&s;&s;ert this of '<HI>moral proportion and harmony,</HI>' but &s;ays that be&s;ides the moral proportion and harmony in true virtue, there is al&s;o a <HI>natural</HI> proportion and harmony, which is the at|tendant of true virtue, in which there is a <HI>natural</HI> beauty of the &s;ame kind with that of material things. And Mr. H. has &s;aid nothing to di&s;prove it, that I can find. And &s;urely Mr. Edwards had a right to build an argu|ment on a premi&s;e which he thought he had fully prov|ed; and which, it &s;eems, Mr. H. did not think be&s;t di|rectly, and expre&s;sly to attempt to di&s;prove, or &s;o much as deny. But Mr. H. goes on.
<Q>It is not po&s;&s;ible to conceive of any thing more ab&s;urd. I de&s;ire any one to take a human mind, adorned with all right, relative affections and exerci&s;es to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, harmoniou&s;ly
<PB N="102" REF="012811_0110_0F8ABF97B278BB08">
agreeable, and beautifully proportioned to his charac|ters and relations to us (only excluding benevolence to being, &s;imply con&s;idered; and let the faith of him be their &s;pring) and carefully compare it with a &s;quare, a cube, and a beautiful piece of embroidery, and try if he can di&s;cover any &s;uch likene&s;s in their beauties as to lead him to pronounce them beauties of the very &s;ame &s;ort or order. He will as &s;oon di&s;cover the actions of a &s;pirit to be of the &s;ame kind with the action or mo|tions of a clock.</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. H. &s;uppo&s;es what is impo&s;&s;ible, viz. that
<Q>a mind may be adorned with all right, relative affections and exerci&s;es to Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q>
&amp;c. when benevolence to being in general is excluded; and that a man is a true believer in Chri&s;t while wholly without this benevolence. He has attempted to form a character here that never exi&s;ted, and never will, becau&s;e it implies a contradiction. Therefore there is no &s;uch character to be con&s;idered. Mr. H. here introduces the beauties of true virtue, and then a&s;ks if there is any likene&s;s between <HI>the&s;e,</HI> and the beauty of a &s;quare, &amp;c. Mr. Edwards does not &s;ay the&s;e are beauties of the &s;ame &s;ort. What he &s;ays is, that over and above the true virtuous beauty in the&s;e relative du|ties, there is al&s;o a beauty of another kind, which it&s;elf is not virtue; but only the attendant of it, and is of the &s;ame kind with the beauty in material things, and may be perceived and delighted in by one who has no virtue, nor any reli&s;h for it. Now, Mr. H. has not offered the lea&s;t evidence that this is not &s;o, in this pa&s;&s;age; nor has he &s;aid any thing really in oppo&s;ition to Mr. Edwards. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Edwards allows there is a natural beauty in the practice of ju&s;tice, and other virtues, <HI>in external conduct.</HI> And when the&s;e are the expre&s;&s;ion of the heart, there is a <HI>moral beauty</HI> in the exerci&s;es of that, the beauty of holine&s;s. But when there is no true virtue in the heart, there is no natural beauty in the exerci&s;es of the mind; all the natural beauty is in the external conduct.</NOTE></P>
<P>But I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. H. after all he has &s;aid to the contrary,
<PB N="103" REF="012811_0111_0F8ABF97D66AB560">
allows the very thing he here oppo&s;es; &s;o oppo&s;es him|&s;elf only, while he thinks he is oppo&s;ing Mr. Edwards. He &s;ays, men who are de&s;titute of true virtue,
<Q>are many times determined to do particular equitable ac|tions to others from a regard to the equity of the ca&s;e, as their true &s;pring, and for equity's &s;ake, &amp;c.</Q>
That a man in dealing with his neighbour, may
<Q>&s;ee what is right between them, and from a regard to the equity of the ca&s;e, deal ju&s;tly with him.</Q>
p. 50. Here he allows that equitable conduct in relative duty may be approved and practi&s;ed, and yet there be no virtue in it. I would a&s;k Mr. H. whether there is not a &s;ort of beauty in this ju&s;tice and equitable conduct, in which there is no vir|tue? He mu&s;t an&s;wer in the affirmative; for what he &s;ays implies it, as he &s;uppo&s;es it is practi&s;ed from a re|gard to the ju&s;tice and equity of the ca&s;e, and for equity's &s;ake. The next que&s;tion is, whether this beauty is the beauty of true virtue, or a beauty of another kind? This he has al&s;o an&s;wered. It cannot be the beauty of true vir|tue; for he expre&s;sly &s;ays there is no true virtue in it. And if there is a beauty in <HI>one in&s;tance</HI> of equitable con|duct, which is of a different kind from the true beauty of virtue, this may be the ca&s;e, yea certainly mu&s;t be, in <HI>all in&s;tances.</HI> And this is a <HI>&s;econdary beauty,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in a natural harmony and agreement of one thing with another; the very &s;ame beauty which is found in mate|rial things. Thus Mr. Hart allows all that Mr. Ed|wards has a&s;&s;erted concerning &s;econdary beauty, and ex|pre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts at the latter end of his book, what he great|ly condemns in Mr. Edwards towards the beginning.
<Q>Error is fated to run crooked. The <HI>greate&s;t men</HI> can't govern, and keep it &s;traight.</Q>

<P>Mr. Edwards having ob&s;erved that it was evident, from what he has &s;aid, that the 'di&s;po&s;ition or &s;en&s;e of the mind which con&s;i&s;ts in a determination of mind to ap|prove and be plea&s;ed with this (&s;econdary) beauty, con|&s;idered &s;imply, and by it&s;elf, has nothing of the nature of
<PB N="104" REF="012811_0112_0F8ABF988982E408">
true virtue, and is entirely a different thing from a truly virtuous ta&s;te;' there being no more virtue in it than there is in 'a di&s;po&s;ition to approve the harmony of good mu|&s;ic,' &amp;c. Mr H. makes the following ob&s;ervation upon it.
<Q>If this good man had attended to one obvious di&s;|tinction, he might have &s;aved him&s;elf from falling into this <HI>grand ab&s;urdity,</HI> viz. The difference there is in the nature of things, between the mind's &s;eeing and appro|ving the harmonious proportion and ju&s;tne&s;s of virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of heart, towards God and our neighbour, and having &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es him&s;elf. A man may &s;ee and approve the beauty and excellence of true virtue, <HI>in &s;ome degree,</HI> and yet his heart not be in this beautifully harmonious and equi|table temper and &s;tate.</Q>
p. 20.21.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. 'This good man' has attended to this di&s;|tinction, and thought he had demon&s;trated the
'grand ab&s;urdity'
and impo&s;&s;ibility of what is &s;uppo&s;ed in it, in the following words.
<Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould truly <HI>reli&s;h</HI> this beauty, con&s;i&s;ting in general be|nevolence, who has not that temper him&s;elf. I have ob&s;erved, that if any being is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a tem|per, he will unavoidably be plea&s;ed with the &s;ame tem|per in another. And it may be in like manner demon|&s;trated, that 'tis &s;uch a &s;pirit, and nothing el&s;e, that will reli&s;h &s;uch a &s;pirit. For if a being, de&s;titute of benevolence, &s;hould love benevolence to being in gene|ral, it would prize and &s;eek that which it had no value for. Becau&s;e to love an inclination to the good of be|ing in general, would imply a loving and prizing the good of being in general. For how &s;hould one love and value a di&s;po&s;ition to a thing, or a tendency to promote a thing, and for that very rea&s;on, becau&s;e it tends to promote it, when the thing it&s;elf is what he is regard|le&s;s of, and has no value for, nor de&s;ires to have it pro|moted.</Q>

<P>Had Mr. H. well attended to this pa&s;&s;age, and deter|mined

to &s;ay nothing contrary to it, till he could an&s;wer it, 'he might have &s;aved him&s;elf from falling into the <HI>grand ab&s;urdity</HI>' contained in the words ju&s;t quoted from him. For,&mdash;</P>
<P>ANS. 2. Nothing can be more ab&s;urd, and imply a greater contradiction, than that which Mr. H. here af|firms, viz. that the heart which is in no degree virtuous, does at the &s;ame time approve of virtue; and that there is a difference in the nature of things between the&s;e. Heart|ily to approve of virtue for its own &s;ake, is to be at heart a friend to virtue, and to love holine&s;s for holine&s;s &s;ake; and can this take place in an unholy heart? A heart that is an enemy to all virtue? It is impo&s;&s;ible. It is even a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, <HI>that the love of holine&s;s, is holine&s;s</HI>; and therefore has pa&s;&s;ed for an inconte&s;tible truth, till Mr. H. has ri&s;en and contradicted it. He &s;ays, 'a man may &s;ee and <HI>approve</HI> the beauty and excellence of virtue, <HI>in &s;ome degree,</HI> and yet his heart not be in this beautifully harmonious and equitable temper and &s;tate.' But why does he limit this to <HI>&s;ome degree?</HI> Why may he not <HI>approve</HI> of the beauty and excellence of virtue <HI>in eve|ry degree,</HI> as well as <HI>in &s;ome degree?</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible for him, or any one el&s;e to tell, unle&s;s it be becau&s;e his heart is <HI>in &s;ome degree</HI> a friend to virtue, i. e. really virtuous; but not &s;o in every degree. All Mr. H's proof of this extraordinary a&s;&s;ertion, is in the following words.
<Q>No|thing is more common, and nothing more to be lament|ed, than this mon&s;trous incon&s;i&s;tence between the mo|ral &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te of the mind, and the <HI>ruling</HI> di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of the heart of man.</Q>
Here is an appeal made to experience; but the whole evidence of the thing to be proved, lies in Mr. H's confident a&s;&s;ertion. I may &s;ay, in my turn, If Mr. H. had attended to one obvious di&s;tinction, he might have &s;aved him&s;elf from falling into this <HI>grand ab&s;urdity,</HI> viz. the difference there is, in the nature of things, between the dictates of the judg|ment and con&s;cience, and the reli&s;h and approbation of
<PB N="106" REF="012811_0114_0F8ABF9A133E1DF0">
the heart. An incon&s;i&s;tence between <HI>the&s;e</HI> is indeed very common; men often love and practice that with their whole hearts, which their rea&s;on and judgment declare to be wrong and hateful; and their con&s;cience pronoun|ces that to be beautiful and excellent, which their hearts do not in any degree approve; but utterly dete&s;t and hate. Here is an incon&s;i&s;tence between the judgment and the heart, which is con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of things, and evident from abundant experience: But for the heart to approve of that which at the &s;ame time it hates and wholly rejects, is indeed a <HI>mon&s;trous incon&s;i&s;tence.</HI> It implies the mo&s;t palpable contradiction; and therefore never did take place, nor ever will, in any one in&s;tance To &s;ee beauty, and heartily approve of it, as &s;uch, or to ta&s;te and reli&s;h the beauty of holine&s;s, as &s;uch, is the &s;ame with the love of holine&s;s, as &s;uch, or for its own &s;ake. And when Mr. H. will prove that the heart of man may be thus friendly to holine&s;s, and love it for its own &s;ake, while de&s;titute of all true virtue, he will &s;hew that he has not fallen into the grand ab&s;urdity with which he is charged.</P>
<P>Mr. H. &s;ays, that according to Mr. E.
<Q>the nature and character, or perfections of God, are <HI>no cau&s;e</HI> or <HI>ground</HI> of the fir&s;t exi&s;tence of a virtuous or holy principle in the hearts of created, intelligent beings.</Q>
And adds,
<Q>I &s;hould be glad to know how the general attraction or propen&s;ity of mind to being, comes into exi&s;tence.</Q>
p. 22, marg.</P>
<P>ANS. It comes into exi&s;tence by the omnipotent ener|gy of God. It is his workman&s;hip, by which men are <HI>created</HI> in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, who fir&s;t <HI>cre|ated</HI> man in his own image. Gen. 1.27. Eph. 10.4.24 God gives them a new heart; a heart to know him, &amp;c. Jer. 24.7. Ezek. 36.26. Giving a heart to know God, mu&s;t be a work of power, in order to their know|ing him; and therefore cannot be effected by the know|ledge of him, or a true &s;ight of the perfections of God.
<PB N="107" REF="012811_0115_0F8ABF9AD9B57778">
A &s;ight and knowledge of the divine perfections cannot be the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> or <HI>ground</HI> of that which is done in order to this knowledge taking place, or in giving a heart thus to know God. It is the new heart, the circumci&s;ed, benevolent heart, and not the old, uncircumci&s;ed, &s;elfi&s;h heart, that &s;ees the divine character, and loves it. It is granted the heart would not &s;ee and love, were there nothing to be &s;een and loved; and in this &s;en&s;e the character &s;een and loved, is the ground and cau&s;e, <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI>; as without this there would be no object of love. But the efficient cau&s;e, ground and foundation of all, is the divine power and energy, circumci&s;ing the heart to know and love; giving a new heart, or the &s;pirit of God taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, is a powerful principle of bene|volence. And in this way, even by the immediate exer|tion of divine, new-creating power, the heart becomes benevolent.</P>
<P>Mr. H's repre&s;entation &s;uppo&s;es divine power and energy to be the cau&s;e of all virtue in the creature, and that it owes its fir&s;t exi&s;tence to this; and &s;o has really an&s;wered the que&s;tion which he puts. He &s;uppo&s;es
'a realizing belief'
of the divine character and love, by which God's excellence and love is 'perceived, realized and <HI>felt,</HI> as extended to them,' is given to them by God: Or that 'tis God who 'gives them to <HI>feel</HI> in them&s;elves his attracting love,' &amp;c. and that this is the cau&s;e, ground and rea&s;on, why one &s;ees, realizes and <HI>feels</HI> this excellence &amp; love of God, rather than another, &amp; why he does it now, rather than before. p. 23, 24. This realizing belief, &s;en&s;i|bility, &amp; <HI>feeling</HI> is given by God, in taking away the heart of &s;tone, which would not realize and <HI>feel</HI> this excellence and love, and giving a new heart, a heart of fle&s;h. This then is the cau&s;e, ground and &s;ource of the fir&s;t exi&s;tence of all true virtue, and mu&s;t be &s;o, according to Mr. H. And I conclude Mr. H. will not &s;ay, this divine ope|ration, by which it is given to men to &s;ee and feel God's excellence and love, is by the truth &s;een; becau&s;e this
<PB N="108" REF="012811_0116_0F8ABF9B88DED7F0">
would be to make the effect the means and cau&s;e of it|&s;elf, and to &s;uppo&s;e God works by that which is the fruit and con&s;equence of his own operation. Surely that which God does, in order to make men &s;ee and feel, is not done <HI>by</HI> their &s;eeing and feeling, or by the things &s;een and felt; but by an immediate operation. If Mr. H. will not grant this, he will find him&s;elf in the ca&s;e of his before-menti|oned Indian.</P>
<P>Mr. H. &s;ays,
<Q>This doctrine of Mr. Edwards's &s;eems to be the foundation on which &s;everal doctrines, in the <HI>new</HI> &s;cheme of divinity, are built. The&s;e in particular, viz. That the moral perfections and character of God, as revealed by the go&s;pel, and &s;een by natural men, un|der the teaching of the word and &s;pirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o far as they are capable of &s;eeing them, can have no po&s;&s;ible influence in changing their hearts. Regenera|tion con&s;i&s;ts in giving or planting in the heart a new, &s;piritual ta&s;te or reli&s;h. This change is not wrought by the in&s;trumentallity of light, or by any means what&s;o|ever; the word of God is not a means in the hand of the &s;pirit, in working this change; but it is effected by meer, ab&s;olute, and properly creating power, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hart has not mentioned the&s;e doctrines exactly in the words of tho&s;e to whom he imputes them; and when they have u&s;ed any of the&s;e words, they have explained them, and guarded again&s;t a wrong &s;en&s;e, which the read|er will be in danger of putting upon them, as they are here u&s;ed by Mr. H. The &s;um of the doctrines that have been advanced on this head, &s;o far as I can learn, is this, viz. that the human heart is naturally &s;o wholly cor|rupt, &s;o blind and oppo&s;ite to the beauty and excellence of divine truth and holine&s;s, that in order to its &s;eeing and reli&s;hing this, a divine power mu&s;t be exerted on the heart, of which divine power and operation, this &s;ight and reli&s;h of truth is the effect. The divine operation in this ca&s;e is as much antecedent to this &s;ight and ta&s;te, as the open|ing the eyes is antecedent to &s;eeing; and as much the
<PB N="109" REF="012811_0117_0F8ABF9CC1672568">
effect and con&s;equence of this work, as &s;eeing is the ef|fect and con&s;equence of having the eyes opened: There|fore light, or the truth &s;een, is not any means of that pow|erful operation, which is antecedent to &s;eeing the truth, and does produce this &s;ight, as the cau&s;e of it: For, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, it is the effect, and not the cau&s;e; and divine truth &s;een and reli&s;hed, is really that in which the active change con&s;i&s;ts, which is the effect of the divine power.</P>
<P>Mr. H. grants this is all true, if Mr. Edwards's notion of true virtue is right: So that, according to him (and I &s;uppo&s;e it is the truth of the ca&s;e) the di&s;pute is, at bot|tom, about the nature of true holine&s;s, which is the &s;ame with the nature of God's moral character. If this is rightly &s;tated in the preceeding inquiry, what Mr. H. calls 'the <HI>new</HI> &s;cheme of divinity,' is as old as the bible, and the only &s;criptural one: If not, his oppo&s;ition may perhaps be ju&s;tified.</P>

<P>MR. Hart's objections again&s;t Mr. Edwards's de|&s;cription of natural con&s;cience and moral &s;en&s;e, are grounded on his excluding from it all reli&s;h and ap|probation of heart, of the beauty and excellence of virtue; and all true &s;en&s;e &amp; di&s;cerning of that in which it con&s;i&s;ts. He has formed his ob&s;ervations upon this under <HI>five</HI> par|ticulars. p. 29&mdash;39. But the whole of the objections he makes again&s;t it, may be reduced to the three follow|ing.</P>
<P N="1">I. If natural con&s;cience does not &s;ee and reli&s;h true vir|tue,
<PB N="110" REF="012811_0118_0F8ABF9D1C47D288">
or that very beauty and excellence in which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from every thing el&s;e, then the dictates of con&s;cience, and the &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert which is implied in it, are without foundation, and wrong, and it
<Q>unavoidably deceives us; for moral de&s;ert is nece&s;&s;arily connected with, and has a natural and direct relation to, this qua|lity in moral actions, wherein their virtuou&s;ne&s;s or vici|ou&s;ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, and to nothing el&s;e. But (according to Mr. Edwards) natural con&s;cience has no perception or &s;en&s;e of that quality in moral actions, wherein their vir|tuou&s;ne&s;s e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts; but, as a wrong-headed thing, places it in that wherein it does not at all con&s;i&s;t, and &s;o connects the &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert wrong, and contrary to the true nature of things.</Q>
p. 30, 31.</P>
<P>ANS. There is in natural con&s;cience the exerci&s;e of rea|&s;on and judgment, which may be right, and agreeable to the truth, independent of the exerci&s;es of the heart, and in direct oppo&s;ition to them. Rea&s;on and judgment may pronounce a thing right, morally good and excellent, while to the reli&s;h and inclination of the heart, it is utter|ly ineligible and di&s;plea&s;ing. In this ca&s;e, con&s;cience is not a wrong-headed thing, but dictates the truth. Rea&s;on and judgment being rightly informed, and free from &s;pe|culative error, are &s;o far from deceiving us, that, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, they dictate nothing but the truth, and place virtue and vice, and moral de&s;ert, in that in which they truly con&s;i&s;t. There is &s;o much evidence of this from fact and experience, that I &s;uppo&s;e it needle&s;s to attempt to make it more evident by rea&s;oning upon it.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, this does not remove the difficulty; for the&s;e dictates of rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;e an idea of the thing, of which it judges, and that it is &s;een in a true light. How can the mind judge of that, of which it has no true &s;ight or conception? It judges of what it &s;ees, and not of that which it does not &s;ee.</P>
<P>ANS. The rea&s;on &amp; judgment may be convinced of the beauty, excellence &amp; worthine&s;s of an object, of which beau|ty
<PB N="111" REF="012811_0119_0F8ABF9F3088D5D0">
and excellence the mind has not the lea&s;t ta&s;te &amp; reli&s;h; &amp; in this &s;en&s;e there is no idea or &s;ight of the beauty and excellence of the object. This is certain from fact and experience, as has been ju&s;t ob&s;erved. And this is all that is affirmed in the ca&s;e before us; and therefore the thing that is objected again&s;t. Con&s;equently the objecti|on mu&s;t be groundle&s;s. The ta&s;te and &s;en&s;e of the natu|ral beauty which there is in true virtue, and a de&s;ire to be &s;elf-con&s;i&s;tent, and oppo&s;ition to the contrary (both which Mr. Edwards ob&s;erves come into natural con&s;cience, and the moral &s;en&s;e) may be nece&s;&s;ary to give an idea and &s;en&s;e of any thing moral, and of moral de&s;ert; and yet the judgment and con&s;cience place true virtue and moral de&s;ert, in that in which it really con&s;i&s;ts. Rea&s;on may dictate that the beauty which the mind di&s;cerns and re|li&s;hes, is not the true beauty of virtue; but this is &s;ome|thing of a more noble kind, con&s;i&s;ting in union of heart to heart, in univer&s;al benevolence; and that all moral de&s;ert lies in this, and its contrary. I &s;ay, rea&s;on and con&s;cience may dictate all this, without any actual idea, or real perception of that &s;weet beauty and excellence there is in virtue, or the lea&s;t degree of reli&s;h of it: And will do &s;o, if all &s;peculative error is removed. Thus na|tural con&s;cience, when duly enlightened, will approve of true virtue, and nothing el&s;e, as really excellent and prai&s;e worthy. And if a man does not judge right in this ca&s;e; but is deceived. and judges that true virtue con&s;i&s;ts in that natural agreement and &s;econdary beauty, which he &s;ees and reli&s;hes, 'tis his own fault, and an abu&s;e of his rea&s;on, through the prejudices and corruption of his heart. Mr. H. &s;ays, according to Mr. Edwards's notion of virtue, 'natural con&s;cience is wholly ignorant of it, and uninte|re&s;ted in it.' But herein he is greatly mi&s;taken. The rea|&s;on and judgment may be fully convinced that true vir|tue con&s;i&s;ts in benevolence, while the heart is wholly op|po&s;ed to it, and the moral ta&s;te have no reli&s;h for it, no &s;en&s;e of its &s;weetne&s;s, beauty and excellence. So a man's
<PB N="112" REF="012811_0120_0F8ABF9F56F8A938">
con&s;cience may be convinced that he is wholly without all true virtue, and all proper idea and &s;en&s;e of it; and that he is wholly to blame for not exerci&s;ing this virtue.</P>
<P>A man who never felt in his heart the lea&s;t degree of love to God, or had any delight in wor&s;hipping him; but the greate&s;t aver&s;ion to i, &amp; is always mo&s;t unea&s;y when obliged to be pre&s;ent where he is wor&s;hipped: But has the highe&s;t reli&s;h for gaming, drinking, and profanene&s;s, and places all his happine&s;s in the&s;e: Such a man may be convinced in his con&s;cience, that there is &s;uch a thing as true &s;upreme love to God, and that there is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t refined plea&s;ure in this, and in wor&s;hipping and &s;erving God, with &s;uch love: That he is under all ima|ginable obligations to love God, and delight in him and his &s;ervice, &s;o that 'tis wholly his fault that he does not: And yet go on in his old way, with as &s;trong an inclination as ever. In this ca&s;e, the man, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, has no true idea of that about which he rea&s;ons right; but is wholly ignorant of the beauty and excellence of God, and has not the lea&s;t ta&s;te and reli&s;h of the plea&s;ure in wor&s;hipping him with true devotion. He has indeed &s;pe|culative ideas of the&s;e, i. e. all the ideas that &s;pecula|tion, by the help of all the &s;en&s;ations he has, will give, or is capable of, while his heart is wholly without any ta&s;te and reli&s;h for moral excellence. In this in&s;tance and there are many &s;uch) his con&s;cience does not deceive him, but judges right, and his rea&s;on condemns what his heart re|li&s;hes and approves, and pronounces that right, excellent and happy, of which he has not the lea&s;t ta&s;te or reli&s;h; and &s;o no true idea of the beauty, excellence and happi|ne&s;s of what his con&s;cience approves, or his rea&s;on judges to be right and excellent.</P>
<P>The man who has no di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, may have a &s;peculative idea of it, i. e. all the idea that there is, or can be, in meer &s;peculation, and all that is nece&s;&s;ary in order to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> about it; but can have nothing of that idea which comes by ta&s;te and reli&s;h of the thing, and im|plies
<PB N="113" REF="012811_0121_0F8ABFA00A6D01A0">
a &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of its true beauty and excellence. All the blindne&s;s and ignorance there is in this ca&s;e, lies wholly in the want of &s;uch a ta&s;te and reli&s;h, and in an inclination to that which is oppo&s;ite to it. The natural moral ta&s;te, which does not reach to true virtue, or imply the lea&s;t reli&s;h for it, but is con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t di&s;reli&s;h of it, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to the mind's forming an idea of any thing moral; and therefore is implied in natural con&s;cience and &s;en&s;e of moral de&s;ert; but is en|tirely a different thing from a reli&s;h of true virtue, or an idea of it's true beauty and excellence.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. H. ob&s;erves that Mr. Edwards &s;ays,
<Q>Natural con&s;cience will approve of true virtue, without &s;eeing the true beauty of it.</Q>
And upon it has the following words.
<Q>Approve of that which you have no idea of, no reli&s;h for! Is not this a contradiction?</Q></P>
<P>ANS. No, by no means. What has been &s;aid, I hope, is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. The appro|bation of con&s;cience in this ca&s;e is entirely a di&s;tinct thing from any reli&s;h and approbation of heart. By <HI>approba|tion</HI> of con&s;cience here is meant <HI>conviction of con&s;cience,</HI> or the rea&s;on and judgment dictating that true virtue is right, excellent, and mo&s;t beautiful, which is a di&s;tinct thing from reli&s;hing, or &s;eeing the beauty.</P>
<P N="2">II. Mr. H. objects that 'From Mr. Edwards's doc|trines it does nece&s;&s;arily follow, that men are under no natural obligation to be virtuous, and can't equitably be required to be &s;o.' p. 34.</P>
<P>The &s;um of what he &s;ays in &s;upport of this is,
<Q>Na|tural con&s;cience and the moral &s;en&s;e can't ta&s;te and ap|prove this kind of virtue, any more than the white of an egg; and natural rea&s;on, and common &s;en&s;e &s;ay there is no worth in it, nor any u&s;e or occa&s;ion for it in the moral world. Nothing but this preternatural princi|ple it&s;elf (i. e. a truly virtuous ta&s;te, or a benevolent mind) can ta&s;te the &s;weetne&s;s of this primary beauty, or perceive any moral excellence in this &s;ort of virtue:
<PB N="114" REF="012811_0122_0F8ABFA15BCD4388">
It lies far beyond the &s;phere of natural con&s;cience and the moral ta&s;te. It is no object to them; con&s;equent|ly man is, by the con&s;titution of his nature, as incapable of &s;eeing or ta&s;ting this primary beauty of moral things, as bea&s;ts are of reli&s;hing their &s;econdary beauty. He is no more made for the one, than they are for the other, and is no more obliged to reli&s;h the one, than they are to reli&s;h the other; and cannot equitably be required to do &s;o, till a new faculty or ta&s;te is given him, adapted to this object, by a new creating act of power.</Q></P>
<P>ANS. 1. When Mr. H. &s;ays, natural con&s;cience cannot approve of this kind of virtue, if by <HI>approve</HI> he means conviction of con&s;cience, that this is true virtue, and that there is a beauty and excellence in it, while the heart di&s;|approves and rejects it, his a&s;&s;ertion is not true, as has been proved. If by <HI>approve</HI> he means a reli&s;h and ap|probation of heart, 'tis granted, and has been proved that no man, who has nothing of the nature of true virtue, can thus approve of it.</P>
<P>When he &s;ays 'natural rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e &s;ay there is no worth in it' (i. e. virtue which con&s;i&s;ts in be|nevolence to being in general) 'nor any u&s;e or occa&s;ion for it in the moral world,' he only begs the que&s;tion, and a&s;&s;erts what is mo&s;t contrary to known fact. There are multitudes, the dictates of who&s;e rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e are, that all true worth and excellence con&s;i&s;t in this; and that this is the life, excellence and happine&s;s of the moral world. And this is the univer&s;al dictate of natural rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, when properly enlightened, and impartial.</P>
<P>And his a&s;&s;ertion, in which all the &s;eeming force of his argument lies, is wholly without foundation, viz. That man is, <HI>by the con&s;titution of his nature,</HI> as incapable of &s;eeing or ta&s;ting this primary beauty of moral things, as the bea&s;ts are of reli&s;hing their &s;econdary beauty. Man is, by the con&s;titution of his nature, as capable of &s;eeing and ta&s;ting this beauty, as he is of exerci&s;ing virtue;
<PB N="115" REF="012811_0123_0F8ABFA1E0F560C0">
for this is one and the &s;ame thing. Man has all the <HI>natu|ral</HI> faculties which are nece&s;&s;ary in order to his being vir|tuous; and therefore by the <HI>con&s;titution of his nature,</HI> is capable of &s;eeing and ta&s;ting the beauty of moral things, and of being perfectly holy. He wants nothing but an inclination to this, a heart to improve the faculties he has, in order to &s;ee and ta&s;te this beauty, and be truly virtuous. In &s;hort, he is furni&s;hed with every thing need|ful in order to &s;ee and exerci&s;e virtue, except it be virtue it&s;elf. This he has not; but has every thing el&s;e, which a creature can have, and not be actually virtuous. And if the want of a virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, or a heart to di&s;cern, and exerci&s;e virtue, and a &s;trong and fixed oppo|&s;ite inclination, take off all obligation to virtue; then it is not po&s;&s;ible that any man &s;hould be under any obliga|tion to exerci&s;e more virtue than he actually has, and does exerci&s;e; and con&s;equently there is no &s;uch thing as &s;in and blame or ill de&s;ert in nature.</P>
<P>But Mr. H. &s;ays,
<Q>This is no more than &s;aying, if they had this new kind of reli&s;h, they would have it, and if they had it, they might ea&s;ily exerci&s;e it. But what is this to the purpo&s;e, when at the &s;ame time they confe&s;s, there is no natural faculty in human nature, by any po&s;&s;ible application of truth to which, this ta&s;te can be rai&s;ed up in the heart? On the&s;e principles, we might, with as much rea&s;on, and as good a grace &s;ay, the inability a blind man is under to &s;ee and reli&s;h the beauty of light, is of the moral kind, and &s;olemnly impute it to him as &s;in.</Q>
p. 35.</P>
<P>ANS. This is &s;aying that this new kind of reli&s;h de|pends on the will or heart, and con&s;i&s;ts in the di&s;po&s;ition and exerci&s;e of that: That &s;o long as the di&s;po&s;ition and choice of the heart is wrong, and in oppo&s;ition to virtue, it has no reli&s;h for it; but when the mind is di&s;po&s;ed and inclined to virtue, it has this ta&s;te and reli&s;h; for they are one and the &s;ame thing. Therefore all the defect lies in the heart, being indi&s;po&s;ed to love and choo&s;e

His ma&s;ter would doubtle&s;s tell him, that he had a very fal&s;e and bad ta&s;te indeed, that he was very capable of knowing and doing better, and it was wholly owing to the viciou&s;ne&s;s of his heart, that he could take no delight in his hou&s;e and &s;ervice, and had become &s;uch a di&s;obedient &s;ervant, &amp;c. and &s;olemnly impute it to him, as his &s;in.

And if Mr. H. by all experiments in his power, &s;hould find nothing in him, 'by any po&s;&s;ible application of truth, to which' he could rai&s;e up in his heart the lea&s;t degree of ta&s;te and reli&s;h for the beauty and order of his hou&s;e, or any inclination to live with him; but a fixed abhorrence of his &s;ervice and all his ways, would this excu&s;e his &s;er|vant in his eyes? No: If he did not dive&s;t him&s;elf of all rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, the further he found his &s;ervant from all ta&s;te and reli&s;h for the bu&s;ine&s;s and enjoy|ment of his hou&s;e, and the more impo&s;&s;ible, by any applications to his mind, to rai&s;e in his heart &s;uch a ta&s;te, or eradicate the contrary, the more would he blame, and impute &s;in to him.</P>

But I think he has &s;aid what is incon&s;i&s;tent with this, and a &s;ufficient ground to conclude he does not hold that unregenerate men are under obligations to be holy. I have reference to what he &s;ays, when it was urged again&s;t him, that the repre&s;entation given in his words ju&s;t quoted, which he had before given, in &s;ub&s;tance, in his dialogues, was as incon&s;i&s;tent with man's obligations to be holy, &amp;c. as the doctrines he objected again&s;t. They are the following words.
<Q>The go&s;pel is a mini&s;tration of &s;upernatu|ral truth &amp; grace, fitted in its nature to work in the mind as a vital &s;eed &amp; &s;acred leaven; &amp; the mind of man is naturally capable of being influenced and changed or &s;piritualized by it, <HI>when firmly believed and realized</HI> The holy &s;pirit of God accompanies this mini&s;tration of the word of life, with &s;ome degree of his influence, <HI>at a common grace.</HI> If &s;inners improve this, and the outward helps they have by the go&s;pel, AS FAR AS THEY ARE IMPROVABLE BY THEM, I <HI>believe</HI> he will crown his common influence with &s;pecial and effectu|al, leading them on to &s;aving faith, and &s;o regenerate them If they do not, but continually re&s;i&s;t and rebel again&s;t the motions of the &s;pirit, and &s;o provoke God to withdraw his &s;pirit and give them up to final blindne&s;s and hardne&s;s of heart, he grace of the go&s;pel is vindicated, and they peri&s;h as de&s;pi&s;ers of it. This belief is con|&s;i&s;tent with my doctrine above.</Q>
Letter to Dr. Whitaker, p. 32.</P>
<P>On the&s;e words the following things may be noted.</P>
<P N="1">1. When Mr. H. &s;ays 'the mind of man is <HI>naturally capable</HI> of be|ing influenced and changed by the truth of the go&s;pel, <HI>when firmly believed and realized,</HI>' it is implied that it is not <HI>naturally</HI> capable of this, until this is the ca&s;e; which he &s;ays is the work of the &s;pirit alone; and that none can believe and realize it, unle&s;s <HI>&s;trongly impre&s;|&s;ed</HI> by the &s;pirit. According to this, men are not <HI>naturally</HI> capable of holine&s;s, i. e. have no natural capacity while without the &s;pirit cau&s;ing them to realize the truth and &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ing it on their minds: Therefore cannot be under obligation to be holy. Thus he who, without any rea&s;on, charges Mr. Edwards with holding that &s;in|ners have no natural capacity of holine&s;s, does him&s;elf a&s;&s;ert it, &s;o as to be <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> liable to the charge.</P>
<P N="2">2. He places all the &s;inner's duty in improving what he calls <HI>com|mon grace,</HI> and the outward helps they have by the go&s;pel, <HI>as far as they are improvable by them.</HI> This they may do without the exerci&s;e of the lea&s;t degree of holine&s;s; therefore they are not obliged to be holy; they not being capable of it, until they have the <HI>&s;pecial and ef|fectual</HI> influence of the &s;pirit. Thus Mr. H. holds 'that men are un|der no natural obligation to be virtuous at all.' With how poor a grace then does this objection again&s;t Mr. Edwards's doctrine come from him?</P>
<P N="3">3. His <HI>belief</HI> that God will <HI>effectually</HI> lead them on to &s;aving faith, <HI>and &s;o</HI> regenerate them who improve the common influences of the &s;pirit, <HI>as far as they are improvable by them,</HI> (i. e. as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with reigning lu&s;t, &amp; enmity again&s;t God) is a belief without any evi|dence from &s;cripture, or any other quarter; and therefore <HI>this belief</HI> is doubtle&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>all</HI> his doctrines, as it is with all the doctrines of Arminians and Pelagians; who have as much of this fond belief as Mr. Hart.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="012811_0127_0F8ABFA4A9EEF470">But as Mr. H. has undertaken to &s;hew parti|cularly what inability does not excu&s;e, we will at|tend to that, and &s;ee if he has given any better ac|count of the matter, than they do whom he thinks he op|po&s;es. He &s;ays,
<Q>That kind of moral inability which does not excu&s;e from blame, but rather aggravates it, is that which our Saviour, and the prophets and apo|&s;tles charge upon the perver&s;e Jews, when they &s;ay they have eyes and &s;ee not, ears and hear not, hearts capable

of under&s;tanding, and yet under&s;tand not, &amp;c. <HI>It con|&s;i&s;ts in an indi&s;po&s;ition, and perver&s;e refu&s;al to exert tho&s;e moral powers which men have.</HI></Q></P>
<P>He has here given a very good account. The di&s;ea&s;e lies wholly in the indi&s;po&s;ition and perver&s;e|ne&s;s of the will or heart; therefore their not &s;eeing, and all their inability to &s;ee, is their own fault. This account is indeed agreeable to &s;cripture, and to rea&s;on and com|mon &s;en&s;e; and is the very &s;ame they give of the matter, whom Mr. H. thinks he is oppo&s;ing. He goes on
<Q>But upon the principles of Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme, the ina|bility of natural men to &s;ee, or rather ta&s;te the &s;weetne&s;s of what he calls virtue, con&s;i&s;ts in the want of a <HI>natural faculty,</HI> or ta&s;te &s;uited to the object.</Q>
This is a mo&s;t ungrounded and injurious a&s;&s;ertion, directly contrary to the whole tenor of Mr. Edwards's writings. I might on as good ground &s;ay, that according to Mr. H. in the ac|count above, men's inability to &s;ee con&s;i&s;ts in the want of a natural faculty, becau&s;e they want a di&s;po&s;ition or heart to &s;ee. Men &s;hut their own eyes, through an indi&s;po&s;i|tion and perver&s;e refu&s;al to exert the powers to have, in &s;eeing and reli&s;hing divine things. The &s;pirit of God a|lone can cure this evil di&s;ea&s;e of the heart, by removing this indi&s;po&s;ition and perver&s;e refu&s;al to &s;ee, and &s;o open|ing the eyes of the blind. This is a renewing the will, or changing the heart, to di&s;cern and ta&s;te the &s;weetne&s;s and excellence of true holine&s;s, and not giving any new natural faculty.</P>
<P>And now the reader is left to judge whether Mr. H. has in any mea&s;ure &s;upported his objection. I proceed to the con&s;ideration of another.</P>
<P N="3">III. Mr. H. &s;ays Mr. Edwards is gro&s;sly incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf in what he &s;ays of natural con&s;cience.&mdash; p. 27.</P>
<P>Mr. H. ob&s;erves Mr. Edwards &s;ays that 'natural con&s;cience, if well informed, will approve of true virtue, and will di&s;approve and condemn the want of it; and yet
<PB N="121" REF="012811_0129_0F8ABFA86BE23CD8">
without &s;eeing the true beauty of it. If men's con&s;cien|ces were fully enlightened, as they will be at the day of judgment, they would approve nothing but true virtue." And then remarks upon it, 'Thus natural con&s;cience does, and does not, can, and can't ta&s;te or approve the true beauty of virtue.'</P>
<P>ANS. What has been &s;aid, in an&s;wer to the fir&s;t objec|tion, may &s;erve to &s;hew how groundle&s;s this is, and that Mr. Edwards is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent here. Rea&s;on and con&s;cience may be truly convinced, and judge, that vir|tue con&s;i&s;ts in general benevolence, and in nothing el&s;e; and therefore that this is the highe&s;t beauty and excel|lence; and yet the mind have no ta&s;te for this beauty, and con&s;equently no true di&s;cerning of it. Rea&s;on and con&s;cience may be &s;o enlightened and convinced, as to judge perfectly right in this matter, which will doubtle&s;s be the ca&s;e at the day of judgment, without any ta&s;te of the beauty of virtue, and con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t di&s;|ta&s;te and abhorrence of it.</P>
<P>Mr. H. might as ea&s;ily, and with as much rea&s;on, fa&s;t|en a contradiction on our Lord, becau&s;e he has &s;aid of his per&s;ecutors, 'They have both <HI>&s;een,</HI> and hated, both me and my Father,' Joh. xv. 24. and yet at the &s;ame time, &s;aid of the &s;ame per&s;ons,
<Q>They have not known the Father, nor me,</Q>
chap. xvi. 3. And with as good rea&s;on might he charge St. John with expre&s;sly contra|dicting his Lord and ma&s;ter, when he &s;ays,
<Q>Who&s;oever &s;inneth, hath <HI>not &s;een</HI> him, neither <HI>known him,</HI></Q>

Whereas Chri&s;t &s;ays of &s;ome of the greate&s;t &s;in|ners, '<HI>they have &s;een</HI> both me, and my Father,' In a word, the bible is &s;o expre&s;s in this, that they who do evil, even all who have no true virtue, whatever advanta|ges they are under to know God; and whatever know|ledge of God they have by natural con&s;cience and moral &s;en&s;e; yet do not know God, nor have &s;een him, and do not &s;ee nor know the holy &s;pirit, who is the &s;um of all holine&s;s in God and the creature, Joh. xiv. 27, that tis
<PB N="122" REF="012811_0130_0F8ABFA9197B25C8">
not a little wonderful, Mr. H. &s;hould take &s;uch great exceptions again&s;t Mr. Edwards's &s;aying the &s;ame thing and imagine he had contradicted him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards &s;ays, natural con&s;cience, when well in|formed, and thoroughly awakened, approves true virtue, and indeed approves nothing that falls &s;hort of it. Upon this Mr. H. &s;ays, 'But the &s;econdary beauty falls &s;hort of it.' Becau&s;e Mr. Edwards had &s;aid there is in natural con&s;cience, a ta&s;te for &s;econdary or natural beauty, he &s;up|po&s;es he has here contradicted him&s;elf. But all the &s;eem|ing contradiction lies in Mr. H's mi&s;take. Mr. Edwards's plain meaning is, that natural con&s;cience is capable of be|ing convinced what true virtue is, &s;o as to judge or pro|nounce that, &amp; nothing which falls &s;hort of it, to be virtue&punc; There may be a ta&s;te for &s;econdary beauty, and yet con|&s;cience not approve of this as true virtue; but pronounce it not to be &s;o.</P>
<P>The following words of Mr. H. are remarkable. Speak|ing of Mr. Edwards's &s;entiments, he &s;ays, 'At the day of judgment natural con&s;cience will be &s;o improved' (i.e. according to Mr. Edwards)
<Q>as to <HI>&s;ee the true beauty of virtue,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in general benevolence, and wholly approve it; which nothing but virtuous benevolence can do. Will not the wicked then become virtuous, according to this doctrine?</Q>
p. 27, 28.</P>
<P>ANS. The doctrine is not Mr. Edwards's, but Mr. H's. One which he has invented, and palmed on Mr. Edwards. Mr. Edwards does not &s;ay that con&s;cience will at the day of judgment <HI>&s;ee the true beauty of virtue,</HI> but he &s;ays di|rectly the contrary in the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t terms. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay how Mr. H. could be guilty of this gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation and abu&s;e, who is &s;o great an advocate for fairne&s;s, candour, hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice in controver&s;ial writings.

<Q>Error is fated to run crooked. The greate&s;t men cannot govern and keep it &s;traight. It is our wi&s;|dom to have nothing to do with it.

<P><PB N="123" REF="012811_0131_0F8ABFA9C8EB5340">WE will now attend to Mr. H's account of natural con&s;cience or moral &s;en&s;e, and &s;ee how he di&s;tingui&s;hes it from a virtuous ta&s;te, between which he &s;ays there is 'a real and e&s;&s;ential difference.' He &s;ays,

&mdash; (Letter to Dr. Wh&mdash;r, p. 60.) I do not pretend to under&s;tand Mr. Hart's laboured explanation of the text which &s;peaks of the natural man's not di&s;cerning the things of the &s;pirit of God. He is to me very dark and confu&s;ed, if not incon&s;i&s;tent, and has left the text as un|intelligible, at lea&s;t, as he found it. However, I think we may &s;afely conclude that in the pa&s;&s;age now quoted, by them who have not received the &s;pirit, and do not give credit to his witne&s;s, he means all unholy men. And the&s;e, he &s;ays, do not receive the things of God as true and divine, neither can they know them to be &s;o.

And to &s;ay that men natural|ly have &s;uch a knowledge and love of God, is contrary to &s;cripture; and is contrary to this very pa&s;&s;age of Mr. H's; for he &s;ays this natural con&s;cience and moral ta&s;te is a different thing from a virtuous ta&s;te; yea there is an <HI>e&s;&s;ential difference</HI> between them; and does not imply any reli&s;h or choice of the object, but the choice, or will may be directly oppo&s;ed to it. What then does Mr. H. mean by his <HI>moral ta&s;te?</HI> He gave &s;uch a de&s;cription of it in his dialogue, that it was thought it nece&s;&s;arily implied a de|gree of true love to God, and to holine&s;s, or a really vir|tuous ta&s;te: But when he &s;aw this con&s;truction was put upon it, he complained that he was greatly abu&s;ed, and &s;aid he meant no &s;uch thing. But has not yet &s;hewn his con&s;i&s;tence in this, &s;o far as I can judge. He a&s;&s;erts that 'a perception of beauty is not love' of beauty; but
<PB N="126" REF="012811_0134_0F8ABFAE392B25A8">
has offered no proof, nor will he ever do it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He has attempted to &s;hew that his moral ta&s;te, and &s;en&s;e of the amiablene&s;s of holine&s;s, is not love of holine&s;s, in his letter to Dr. Whit|aker, p. 8 9. to which the reader is referred. I don't &s;ee any proof of this in all that he has there-&s;aid. The mo&s;t that he &s;ays, is an ac|count of natural con&s;cience and moral ta&s;te, very con&s;i&s;tent with that which Mr. Edwards gives, and he makes a proper di&s;tinction between this and the heart, choice or will, in its judgment in favour of virtue, &amp;c. But he has not &s;hewn that there may be a &s;ight of the beauty and amiablene&s;s of holine&s;s, and a ta&s;te and reli&s;h for it, without any exerci&s;e of heart or choice in favour of it; and while the heart hates and oppo&s;es it. Unle&s;s he can do this, his cau&s;e cannot be maintained.</NOTE> Therefore,</P>
<P N="4">4. The only way I can think of to make Mr. H. in any mea&s;ure con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf in the&s;e things, is to &s;up|po&s;e that by moral ta&s;te, by which the true beauty of vir|tue is &s;een and reli&s;hed, he intends the &s;ame thing in kind with a virtuous ta&s;te; and that the difference lies wholly in the different degrees of the &s;ame kind of thing. That when this &s;ight and reli&s;h of the beauty and excellence of virtue is in &s;o low a degree as not to govern the mind; and &s;uppre&s;s all contrary lu&s;ts, it is not true love to God or to holine&s;s, &s;o is not a holy love; that this con&s;i&s;ts not in this low degree of reli&s;h &amp; love, but in a 'preferring love, which &s;o prevails as to bear down all oppo&s;ite lu&s;ts. His way of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf on this head gives ground to think this is his notion. In the pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration, he &s;ays this moral &s;en&s;e, common to all men, approves of virtue, and feels the obligation they are under to practi&s;e it, <HI>in &s;ome degree</HI>; but does not render them virtuous, while vicious lu&s;ts <HI>prevail,</HI> and the <HI>prevailing</HI> reli&s;h of the heart is in oppo&s;ition to this moral &s;en&s;e. To render a man truly virtuous or holy, his will mu&s;t choo&s;e with <HI>pre|ferring love,</HI> and <HI>determined re&s;olution</HI> to practice what is approved by the moral &s;en&s;e, And he always &s;peaks after this manner, on this &s;ubject. He &s;ays, a man may &s;ee and approve the beauty of virtue, <HI>in &s;ome degree,</HI> when <HI>the ruling</HI> di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es of his heart are incon|&s;i&s;tent with this, p. 20, 21.

p. 51. He ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the &s;ame way on this head, in his letter to Dr. Whitaker: He &s;ays the &s;ight and ta&s;te of the amia|blene&s;s of holine&s;s, and approbation of actions and charac|ters morally good, is not <HI>holy love,</HI> as tis not the &s;ame with their being cho&s;en and embraced by the will, <HI>in preference to all that &s;tands in competition with them.</HI> p. 6. And that it 'is not the &s;ame thing with a <HI>&s;upreme love</HI> and <HI>prferring choice of them,</HI> by the heart; which is e&s;&s;ential to true virtue,' p. 10. He does not &s;ay there is <HI>no degree</HI> of real love of holine&s;s in this &s;ight and reli&s;h of the true beauty of it; but he &s;ays 'tis not <HI>holy love</HI>; i. e. <HI>&s;upreme love,</HI> and <HI>preferring choice.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are &s;uited to &s;uch a notion of virtue, as con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>prevailing, governing degree</HI> of the &s;ame kind of di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es which all men have; but are not true virtue till they ri&s;e to &s;uch &s;trength and high degree, as to <HI>rule and govern</HI> in the heart: And, I think, they are not con&s;i&s;tent with any other notion of it.</P>
<P>But if this is his notion, he has de&s;ignedly covered him|&s;elf, and carefully avoided &s;peaking out plainly, which if he had done, we &s;hould better know what to &s;ay to him. For it might be ea&s;ily proved, that &s;uch a notion of virtue is very unrea&s;onable, and contrary to the bible. And it does not well con&s;i&s;t with his &s;aying that this &s;ame ta&s;te &amp; reli&s;h of the true beauty of virtue is <HI>e&s;&s;entially different</HI> from a virtuous ta&s;te; for the things which are of the &s;ame na|ture and kind, and differ only in degree, can't properly be

<P>As a conclu&s;ion to this and the foregoing &s;ection, the following ob&s;ervations may be made.</P>
<P N="1">1. The holy &s;cripture repre&s;ents all men who are not true believers, and not born of the &s;pirit, as in &s;uch dark|ne&s;s and blindne&s;s that they do not &s;ee and know God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and cannot &s;ee the things of God's kingdom, Joh. 3.3. do not &s;ee the &s;pirit of God, Joh. 14.17. not can di&s;cern the things of the &s;pirit, 1 Cor 2.14. &s;o that the go&s;pel is HID from them, 2. Cor. 4.3, 4. That they only who have a virtuous ta&s;te and are regenerate, do know God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Joh. 17.3. 1 Joh. 4.8. and <HI>ta&s;te</HI> his goodne&s;s, Pla&s;. 34.8. 1 Pet. 2.3. i. e. di&s;|cern and reli&s;h his moral perfection or holine&s;s, which is love or goodne&s;s. And they only have the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 2 Cor. 4 6. with re&s;pect to which all the unregenerate are in total darkne&s;s, which glory can be nothing el&s;e but holine&s;s, which is the beauty and glory of the moral world. And yet the &s;cripture repre&s;ents the&s;e per&s;ons, who are thus blind&punc; as actually blamable for not having that virtue and holine&s;s which they do not &s;ee, and not loving what is hid from them; and that this blindne&s;s and unbelief is it&s;elf a very great crime; though they cannot be cured of it, &s;o a to &s;ee the marvellous light of God's beauty and glory, by any thing but the mighty power of God, quickening, and new creating them, making them new creatures, opening their eyes, or giving them eyes to &s;ee, or a new heart, a heart to perceive and under&s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="012811_0137_0F8ABFAFD0EEB398">Now, &s;ince this is the &s;cripture account, it is &s;ufficient to &s;upport all that Mr. Edwards has &s;aid on this head, and ought to &s;ilence all Mr. H's objections, until he can &s;hew that it is not the &s;ame with that which Mr. Ed|wards has given, and is con&s;i&s;tent with unregenerate men &s;eeing and reli&s;hing the&s;e things in a &s;en&s;e and manner, in which Mr. Edwards &s;ays they do not: For, as the ca&s;e now &s;tands, his objections &s;eem to be equally again&s;t the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="2">2. What Mr. Edwards has &s;aid, and Mr. H. objects again&s;t, is perfectly agreeable to rea&s;on and experience. That they who have no virtue, and who&s;e hearts are whol|ly governed by contrary inclinations and lu&s;ts, cannot, while they remain &s;o, &s;ee and reli&s;h the beauty of true vir|tue, is, in a &s;en&s;e, a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, as the contra|ry implies a mo&s;t evident contradiction. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is &s;o evident, that a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> could &s;ay.
<Q>A mind de&s;titute of virtue, cannot &s;ee the beauty of truth.</Q>
Hierocles.</NOTE> Be&s;ides, we know by experience, that we get the idea of all tho&s;e things which belong to the mind and heart, by what takes place in our own minds and hearts; and cannot obtain it any other way. For in&s;tance, we obtain the idea of love, by the exerci&s;e of this in our own hearts. If no|thing of this kind had ever taken place in our minds, we could not have any true idea of it. And though men exerci&s;e a &s;ort of love, and &s;o know what it is; yet, if this is a love which is di&s;tinct in its nature from di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, it will not help them to the true idea of &s;uch benevolence; and they never can have it, till this takes place in their hearts. The inclination and lu&s;ts of their hearts, which are incon&s;i&s;tent with the lea&s;t degree of be|nevolent love and goodne&s;s, do nece&s;&s;arily blind their eyes, and &s;hut all true knowledge of this love, all true &s;en&s;e and reli&s;h of its beauty, out of their minds. How|ever, they may from the various ta&s;tes and exerci&s;es of their hearts, and their mental powers, be able to rea&s;on well upon the &s;ubject, and be convinced that benevolence,
<PB N="130" REF="012811_0138_0F8ABFB08BDC1A30">
and the affections included in this, is true virtue, and that nothing which falls &s;hort of it is virtue, or has any moral excellence. And as their eyes are &s;hut to the beauty of holine&s;s, and this is excluded from their hearts by nothing but their lu&s;ts, they really clo&s;e their own eyes, to keep the light from them; and are therefore wholly inexcu&s;able in their ignorance and lu&s;ts: And their con&s;cience may be convinced of this, and that they are ju&s;tly condemned for their blindne&s;s and want of ho|line&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. H. has really acknowledged all this, even all that Mr. Edwards has a&s;&s;erted; &s;o that all his oppo&s;ition to Mr. Edwards is, in effect, oppo&s;ition to him&s;elf. This has been evident, I conclude, to every attentive, di&s;cern|ing reader, from what has been ob&s;erved. He allows that the eyes of all unbelievers are fa&s;t clo&s;ed, and &s;hut &s;o as not to receive the knowledge of the truth; which cannot be opened, but by the powerful work of the &s;pirit of God; and that this blindne&s;s, is &s;o far from excu&s;ing men for not being virtuous, and not &s;eeing its beauty, that it rather aggravates their guilt. That all the children of Adam are naturally without the &s;pirit of God, and that while they are in this ca&s;e (in which they all are, till they receive the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, and become true believers in him)
<Q>they are led and influenced <HI>in their judgment</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In their judgment.</HI> If by <HI>judgment</HI> here, Mr H. means rea&s;on and con&s;cience judging, he carries the matter much further than Mr. Ed|wards does, and further than the truth; for he &s;ays the judgment, in this &s;en&s;e, may be right and according to the truth, even in men de|&s;titute of the &s;pirit, and under the dominion of the &s;pirit of this world, and their blinding lu&s;ts. It is granted that lu&s;t and &s;in in the heart does, in many in&s;tance, blind and pervert the rea&s;on and con&s;cience of men; but this is not always &s;o. If by judgment, he means the ta&s;te and di&s;cerning of the heart, he a&s;&s;erts the &s;ame thing which Mr. Edwards does, and which he him&s;elf objects again&s;t.&mdash;</NOTE> concerning the&s;e things</Q>
(i. e. the things of the go&s;pel)
<Q>by the &s;pirit that is of this world; i. e. act under the bia&s;ing and blinding influence of the &s;pirit of error, and
<PB N="131" REF="012811_0139_0F8ABFB146E79BD0">
worldly lu&s;ts. Such do not receive the&s;e things as true and divine, neither can they know them to be &s;o. They may in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ee what his doctrine is; and &s;ee his works and witne&s;s by the go&s;pel revelation; <HI>but they don't &s;ee the &s;pirit of God in them.</HI></Q>
(Letter to Dr. W. p. 60, 61.) If they do not &s;ee the &s;pirit of God in the doc|trines and works of Chri&s;t, they do not &s;ee their holine&s;s; but all the beauty of this is entirely hid from them; for he who is blind to the holy &s;pirit, is blind to holine&s;s it|&s;elf. This needs no proof. Now this is all that is im|plied in what Mr. Edwards has &s;aid. I know Mr. H. <HI>&s;ays,</HI> that according to Mr. Edwards's doctrine, men have no natural capacity, by which they may &s;ee the beauty of virtue, &amp; become holy; and that they can be brought to this only by the immediate, phy&s;ical, miraculous, work of the &s;pirit of God, &amp;c. but this might as rea&s;ona|bly be charged on Mr. H's doctrine, and as ea&s;ily prov|ed.</P>
<P N="4">4. Not only man's blindne&s;s to the beauty of true vir|tue, which Mr. Edwards &s;peaks of, is con&s;i&s;tent with their obligations to holine&s;s; but they may be obliged, though their rea&s;on and con&s;cience be blinded and de|ceived. 'Tis not nece&s;&s;ary that natural con&s;cience and moral ta&s;te &s;hould dictate right, and pronounce true ho|line&s;s to be &s;o, and that it is beautiful and excellent, and the contrary wrong and hateful, in order to the man's be|ing under obligations to be holy, and wholly to blame for not being &s;o. A man may be &s;o deceived as to be|lieve in his con&s;cience that the highe&s;t virtue is nothing but a piece of wickedne&s;s, and that he ought to hate it; and yet be under obligations to love and practice it. This all will grant, I conclude. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e &s;uch blindne&s;s of the judgment and con&s;cience, and per|ver&s;ion of the moral ta&s;te, is wholly owing to the blind|ing lu&s;ts of the heart, &s;o that if the heart were right, rea|&s;on and con&s;cience would judge according to truth. And if the heart remains blind, and &s;ees not the beauty
<PB N="132" REF="012811_0140_0F8ABFB30051B9E0">
and excellence of virtue, but hates it, though the dictates of the con&s;cience are right, and rea&s;on pronounces it beau|tiful and lovely; is not this as blamable, at lea&s;t, as if rea&s;on and con&s;cience agreed with the heart? Shall the blinding lu&s;ts of men's hearts take off all obligations to love what they di&s;reli&s;h and hate, though con|&s;cience tell them, that 'tis excellent and lovely; when this &s;ame blindne&s;s of heart, if it blinds the con|&s;cience too, and bribes that to agree with it, would be altogether blamable? How unrea&s;onable then is Mr. H's objection again&s;t Mr. Edwards's doctrine of the blind|ne&s;s of men's hearts with re&s;pect to the beauty of virtue; as if, according to this, they were under no obligation to holine&s;s! And it is now left to the reader to judge whe|ther all his objections again&s;t Mr. Edwards's account of true virtue, are not equally without foundation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. <HI>Mr. Hart's account of the</HI> e&s;&s;ential nature of true virtue, <HI>and of a</HI> defective &s;ort of virtue, <HI>&amp;c. con&s;idered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. H. had oppo&s;ed Mr. Edwards's notion of true virtue, as wrong, and &s;ubver&s;ive of all religion, and then undertook to &s;hew what is the e&s;&s;ential nature of true virtue, we might rea&s;onably expect he would fix on &s;omething which is in its nature e&s;&s;entially different from that which Mr. Edwards de&s;cribes, and particular|ly &s;hew what it is, and wherein the difference lies. But we are wholly di&s;appointed! He has not de&s;cribed vir|tue, &s;o as to give his readers any clear idea of it, or &s;hew wherein it differs from that which Mr. Edwards de&s;cribes. He &s;ays true virtue con&s;i&s;ts in EQUITABLE AFFECTION towards God and our fellow-creatures. This is con&s;i&s;tent with what Mr. Edwards has &s;aid: According to him, it
<PB N="133" REF="012811_0141_0F8ABFB50EF8B7C8">
con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>equitable affection</HI>; and he has particularly &s;hewn what this is; and that nothing is equitable affec|tion but benevolence to being in general, and the affecti|ons included in this.</P>
<P>And when what Mr. H. &s;ays about his <HI>equitable affecti|on</HI> is put together, it will agree to nothing el&s;e, but the &s;ame univer&s;al benevolence, or love to bring in general; which he &s;eems to think he is oppo&s;ing. He allows that all equitable affection or holine&s;s in the creature con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>love,</HI> p. 43. And &s;peaks of this as a love of kindne&s;s or benevolence, a 'friendly regard' to the object beloved; and &s;ays this is 'in effect univer&s;al love,' p. 47. and that this univer&s;al friendly love, is a conformity to God's holi|ne&s;s, p. 43. which mu&s;t therefore con&s;i&s;t in this &s;ame love. And he particularly &s;peaks of this <HI>equitable affecti|on</HI> in God, as exerci&s;ed in univer&s;al love or goodne&s;s; which is the &s;ame with love to being in general, or to be|ing, as &s;uch; viz. a di&s;po&s;ition
<Q>to give his family of ra|tional creatures as great a mea&s;ure of happine&s;s as can be communicated by the exerci&s;e of a paternal govern|ment over them.</Q>
p. 42. Thus we &s;ee Mr. H. repre|&s;ents his equitable affection as a <HI>friendly</HI> love, which is really <HI>univer&s;al</HI> benevolence; which is love to being in general. And he &s;ay, 'This &s;pirit of equitable, FRIEND|LY REGARD, will di&s;po&s;e the virtuous mind to behave to every one, in a manner &s;uitable to their various characters, offices, and relations.' p. 47. This <HI>friendly regard</HI> is benevolence, and nothing el&s;e, and it mu&s;t be univer&s;al be|nevolence, if it will di&s;po&s;e to behave to <HI>every one</HI> in a &s;uitable manner. And this mu&s;t be true virtue in its e&s;&s;ential nature, and comprehend the whole of holine&s;s, as this will lead to <HI>all</HI> right exerci&s;es and conduct towards <HI>every one.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. H. &s;eems indeed to &s;uppo&s;e that he is here oppo|&s;ing Mr. Edwards's notion of true virtue, as e&s;&s;entially wrong, and repeatedly a&s;&s;erts it to be &s;o, but, as his a&s;&s;er|tions don't &s;o much re&s;pect the e&s;&s;ential nature of
<PB N="134" REF="012811_0142_0F8ABFB5C8F2D138">
true virtue, as the manner in which it takes place and be|gins in men, and the cau&s;e and medium by which it is produced; and as he &s;ays nothing here on this head which he had not &s;aid before, and has been con&s;idered; and &s;ince he does not pretend to argue, but &s;eems to ex|pect the reader will believe his bare a&s;&s;ertions, without any manner of proof, they are not worthy of any further at|tention. However, it may be proper to take a little no|tice of two pa&s;&s;ages in this chapter.</P>
<P>Mr. H. having a&s;&s;erted
<Q>That God him&s;elf is the &s;ource and &s;upport of virtue in us, which is the attraction and active tendency of our minds towards him, in con&s;e|quence of their being brought under the attractive in|fluence of his ble&s;&s;ed character and gracious love to us in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q>
goes on to &s;ay,&mdash;
<Q>To talk of a moral change in the mind, forming the heart to a virtuous temper, as preceding this attraction of God upon the mind, and as nece&s;&s;ary to render that effectual, is the &s;ame ab&s;urdity in divinity or moral philo&s;ophy, as it would be in natural, to a&s;&s;ert that a body naturally cold, mu&s;t fir&s;t change its nature, &amp; become of a hot nature, like the &s;un, before it can be warmed by the action of the &s;un's rays upon it, however near the &s;un may ap|proach towards it.</Q>
p. 44, 45.</P>
<P>ANS. a body, naturally cold, mu&s;t be of &s;uch a na|ture and con&s;truction, as to receive the rays of light and heat from the &s;un, or imbibe them &s;o that they &s;hall be in a &s;en&s;e incorporated with it, in order to its being warm|ed by them. If a body &s;hould not be of &s;uch a nature and con&s;truction, but formed &s;o as to repel the rays of the &s;un, no degree of heat from the &s;un would impart the lea&s;t heat to that, till the nature of it is changed, or with|out the exertion of a power upon it, entirely different from the influence of the heat of the &s;un. Mr. H's in&s;tance is therefore not to the purpo&s;e; for it does not appear, that 'tis the lea&s;t ab&s;urdity in natural philo&s;ophy to a&s;&s;ert, that a body <HI>perfectly</HI> cold, and of &s;uch a nature as to repel all
<PB N="135" REF="012811_0143_0F8ABFB688755FF0">
heat, cannot be warmed by the action of the &s;un's rays up|on it; for, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, they cannot act upon it, while it is of &s;uch a nature.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE other pa&s;&s;age I would take notice of, is in the fol|lowing words,
<Q>virtue, as it re&s;pects our neighbour, &s;um|marily con&s;i&s;ts in loving him <HI>as our&s;elves.</HI> Which im|plies that there is a love of our&s;elves, which is virtuous, and approved of God: Otherwi&s;e our loving our neigh|bour as our&s;elves, could not be a virtuous love.</Q>
p. 46. What Mr. H. here ob&s;erves is doubtle&s;s true, and his argument ju&s;t and conclu&s;ive. There is a love of our&s;elves which is virtuous; but this is not &s;elf-love; for this is, in every degree of it, &s;inful: But 'tis that love of our&s;elves, which is implied in univer&s;al benevolence. This has been already particularly con&s;idered. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See preceding inquiry, Sect. iv. p. 24, 25, 26.</NOTE> There|fore if Mr. H. by a love of our&s;elves meant &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or any thing different from univer&s;al benevolence, his a&s;|&s;ertion is not true.</P>
<P>MR. HART has a chapter on 'that defective &s;ort of virtue which is found in &s;ome unregenerate men,' to which I &s;hall now attend. He &s;ays,
<Q>'Tis undoubtedly true in fact, that many men, who are not truly religious, practice many duties. Their hearts, in many in&s;tances, concur, <HI>in &s;ome degree,</HI> with the moral &s;en&s;e of their minds. A &s;en&s;e of equity, of moral honor, of grati|tude, and a &s;pirit of benevolence, compa&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. and &s;ome kind of regard to God, influence them to do ma|ny worthy deeds, worthy in &s;ome re&s;pects: So are in a great degree incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, in their di&s;|po&s;itions and conduct:</Q>
And he &s;ays of him who practi&s;es the&s;e duties,
<Q>The action he does is a right action, in re&s;pect to what is po&s;itive in it, commanded by God, and the motive on which he acts is a right motive, one of the motives God wills him to be influ|enced by.</Q>
p. 48, 49, 50. He &s;ays this is not true vir|tue;
<PB N="136" REF="012811_0144_0F8ABFB746E384F0">
not becau&s;e it is not in it&s;elf right and duty; but becau&s;e it is not attended with &s;omething el&s;e, which ought to take place, viz. an effectually governing regard to God</P>
<P>On this the following ob&s;ervations may be made.</P>
<P N="1">1. There &s;eems to be a great ab&s;urdity in this; viz. that a man's heart &s;hould concur, in &s;ome degree, with his enlightened con&s;cience or moral &s;en&s;e, &amp; he have a &s;pirit of true benevolence, and &s;ome kind of regard to God&punc; un|der the influence of which he does his duty, what God requires, from the motives which God has commanded him to be influenced by; and yet not exerci&s;e the lea&s;t degree of true holine&s;s. This is indeed a great paradox, and &s;eems to be as much of a contradiction as to &s;ay, a man may be holy, and yet have no holine&s;s. If a per&s;on may do his duty, and have his heart conformed to the law of God in the exerci&s;e of true gratitude, benevolence and compa&s;&s;ion or mercy, and yet not exerci&s;e any true virtue, it is doubtle&s;s impo&s;&s;ible to tell what virtue is. If it does not con&s;i&s;t in benevolence, in duty, and obedience to the law of God, and conformity of heart to it, we may de&s;pair of ever finding it in any creature.</P>
<P>Mr. H. &s;ays, this is not true virtue but 'e&s;&s;entially de|ficient' becau&s;e there is no governing, or religious regard to God. But this is &s;o far from giving a rational account of the matter, that it &s;uppo&s;es what is impo&s;&s;ible, viz. that the former may be without the latter. There is no &s;uch character in nature as Mr. H. here gives. He who&s;e heart is oppo&s;ed to a religious regard to God, is equally oppo&s;ed to every thing which God has commanded. He who is benevolent and merciful, knows God and loves him, and cannot but have a religious regard to him, (See Jer. xxi. 15, 16. Mat. v. 7.) Mr. H. &s;ays ''Tis unde|niably true in tact, that there is &s;uch a character;' but he has a&s;&s;erted this in oppo&s;ition to &s;cripture and rea&s;on. Yea he has herein oppo&s;ed him&s;elf; for in the preced|ing chapter he repre&s;ents love to our fellow men and all
<PB N="137" REF="012811_0145_0F8ABFB9190F3110">
equitable regard to them, as the fruit of love to God, and flowing from it, being 'the re&s;ult of a truly pious and filial regard to him.' p. 46, 47. Here he a&s;&s;erts that this equitable regard to men, a regard to ju&s;tice, benevo|lence and compa&s;&s;ion, takes place, when there is no religi|ous regard to God; and that when this <HI>religious regard to God</HI> is added to this benevolence, it is &s;anctified by it, and forms a truly virtuous character. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This pa&s;&s;age is agreeable to the notion that all men have <HI>&s;ome de|gree</HI> of that love to God and their neighbour in which true holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts; but being <HI>defective,</HI> i. e. not <HI>governing love,</HI> it cannot be called holine&s;s. The whole of this chapter is &s;uited to &s;uch a notion, as is mo&s;t Mr. H. &s;ays; el&s;e where of his <HI>moral</HI> ta&s;te; though he has &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which &s;eem to be incon&s;i&s;tent with this.

<P N="2">2. Since Mr. H. has only a&s;&s;erted the&s;e things, with|out attemping any proof of them, I have none of his ar|guments to an&s;wer. He has, however, referred to two pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, as an illu&s;tration of what he a&s;&s;erts, which perhaps ought to be con&s;idered. He ob&s;erves, when the Jews had &s;et their &s;ervants free, according to God's command, but &s;oon brought them into bondage again; God, reproving them for their la&s;t conduct, &s;ays, with reference to their di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them, 'ye had done right in my &s;ight.' Jer. 34.15. This he mentions, I con|clude, to prove that wicked men who have no true vir|tue, may do that which is <HI>right in God's &s;ight.</HI> p. 51. marg.</P>
<P>ANS. God in the&s;e words has reference to their exter|nal conduct, and not to their hearts, and the motives from which they acted; and &s;peaks to them, not as the &s;earcher of hearts; but as looking on their outward conduct, and treating them accordingly. Mr. H. allows that all the actions which &s;pring from vicious motives, and lu&s;ts of heart, are po&s;itively vicious. p. 52. But 'tis pretty evident the Jews did not let their &s;ervants go free, from any higher or le&s;s vicious motive, than that which influ|enced them to bring them into bondage again. The king
<PB N="138" REF="012811_0146_0F8ABFBB13FA45E8">
of Babylon had laid clo&s;e &s;iege to the city, and they fear|ed the de&s;truction that was threatened. The prophets told them to di&s;mi&s;s their &s;ervants, as one way to obtain deliverance. But when their danger &s;eemed to be over, the Chaldeans having rai&s;ed the &s;iege, in order to repel Pharaoh's army, which was coming for the relief of the Jews, they brought their &s;ervants into bondage again. They did not relea&s;e them, from any regard to ju&s;tice, from benevolence and compa&s;&s;ion, but from the &s;ame &s;ordid, &s;elfi&s;h motive, under the influence of which they forced them into their &s;ervice again, when they thought the danger of the evil was over, from fears of which they let them go. They acted from the &s;ame mo|tive which induced Pharaoh and the Egyptians to let the I&s;raelites go; and therefore when their fears of de&s;truc|tion were removed, they repented, as Pharaoh did. And I conclude, Mr. H. will not &s;ay that Pharaoh exerci&s;ed even his <HI>defective &s;ort of virtue</HI> in letting the people of I&s;rael go, and even thru&s;ting them out of Egypt.</P>
<P>Mr. H. repre&s;ents this <HI>defective virtue,</HI> which he &s;ays is <HI>good,</HI> and <HI>doing well,</HI> &s;o far as it goes, 'the agent be|ing faulted only for that which is wanting in his work,' by what he &s;ays is called hi&s;torical faith, of which St. James &s;ays, 'Thou believe&s;t there is one God, thou <HI>do&s;t well.</HI> But le&s;t men &s;hould re&s;t here, he adds, devils al&s;o believe and tremble.' This he brings as a proof that wicked men may <HI>do well.</HI> And &s;uppo&s;es that to encour|age them to do better, the apo&s;tle adds, 'The devils al&s;o believe and tremble.' p. 52. It is evident at fir&s;t view, that he tells them their doing well was no better than what the devils do: Yea, he repre&s;ents the devils as go|ing further than they did; for they not only believe, but tremble. Can any one &s;eriou&s;ly think the apo&s;tle meant to repre&s;ent the devils as <HI>doing well?</HI> This is &s;hocking indeed! As well may we &s;uppo&s;e our Saviour commends the Phari&s;ees and Scribes as doing well, when he &s;ays '<HI>full well</HI> ye reject the commandment of God,'
<PB N="139" REF="012811_0147_0F8ABFBBC9FCCB10">
Mark 7.9. The &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tle's words is as plain and natural, as of the&s;e words of Chri&s;t, and they are &s;poke in the &s;ame way. As if he had &s;aid, 'You believe there is one God. Well done! A fine at|tainment this! This is to do as well as the devils, except that they not only believe, but tremble al&s;o.' It is to be ob&s;erved, that the word u&s;ed by Chri&s;t, tran&s;lated <HI>full well,</HI> is the &s;ame that the apo&s;tle u&s;es here. If Mr. H's defective &s;ort of virtue is 'fitly re&s;embled' to this faith, as he &s;ays it is, and is found to as great degree, at lea&s;t, among the devils, as 'in &s;ome unregenerate men,' it turns out to be a very low, 'defective &s;ort of virtue' indeed, by which, they who have it are not much di&s;tingui&s;hed from the wor&s;t of men, unle&s;s <HI>they</HI> are much wor&s;e than devils. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mr. H. complains of Dr. Whitaker for &s;aying 'Man is turned devil'; and &s;ays 'before he gets out of his hands, he makes him look wor&s;e than a devil, Dial. p. 42.

<P>Mr. H. &s;ays,
<Q>There are certain middle principles or &s;prings of action wrought into the mind of man, by our gracious Creator, which, though they are not virtu|ous, and do not nece&s;&s;ary imply a principle of virtue in the heart, yet are friendly to virtue, and e&s;pou&s;e its cau&s;e within us, &s;uppo&s;e the mind duly in&s;tructed: Such are rea&s;on, natural con&s;cience, the moral &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, &amp;c.</Q>
p. 49, 50.</P>
<P>Remark 1&s;t. It &s;eems to be a contradiction, that there &s;hould be any thing in the mind of man, which is <HI>friendly to virtue,</HI> which is not virtue, nor implies any principle of virtue in the heart. Can there be any thing in the heart <HI>friendly to virtue,</HI> which has nothing of the nature of virtue? If a man is a true friend to virtue, we think we may &s;afely pronounce him a virtuous man.</P>

and natural con&s;cience, if enlightened, do in a &s;en&s;e 'e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of virtue,' i. e. bear te&s;timony in its favour. But this is con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t degree of vice; and &s;erves to &s;et the &s;inner further from all virtue, if po&s;&s;ible, by rendering him more criminal and vile; for the more clear this te&s;timony is, the more oppo&s;ition is made to it by the &s;inner, and the more criminal he is, in refu&s;ing to comply with the dictates of his con&s;cience. This Mr. H. him&s;elf allows. He &s;ays, 'The&s;e have &s;ome degree of influence in natural men.' I a&s;k, what influ|ence? Do they influence them in the lea&s;t degree to com|ply with that, who&s;e cau&s;e they e&s;pou&s;e? This Mr. H. denies; for this would make them virtuous. All the in|fluence they can have then, while their hearts oppo&s;e vir|tue, is to render this oppo&s;ition more vile and criminal, as well as &s;tronger, and more directly turned again&s;t that in which true virtue con&s;i&s;ts. Mr. H. allows that if men re&s;i&s;t the call of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, and refu&s;e to com|ply with their dictates, they hereby become much wor&s;e, and that herein con&s;i&s;ts the exceeding &s;infulne&s;s of &s;in: but this they do, &s;o long as they refu&s;e to become truly virtuous, if con&s;cience e&s;pou&s;es the cau&s;e of virtue in them. What room then is there left for Mr. H's 'de|fective &s;ort of virtue,' by means of the dictates of natural con&s;cience? It is wholly excluded; or rather is nothing but the exceeding &s;infulne&s;s of &s;in.</P>
<P>Remark 3d. If we &s;hould grant all Mr. H. &s;ays here, that
<Q>there are principles or &s;prings of action, wrought into the mind of man, by our gracious Creator, which are friendly to virtue:</Q>
Why may not <HI>a prin|ciple of true virtue</HI> be wrought into the mind by God, as well as the&s;e principles, which are friendly to virtue? The&s;e principles of action, which are favourable to vir|tue, are not wrought in the mind by moral power, or the power of divine truth or love; but by creating power, I conclude Mr. H. will allow. Why may not the prin|ciples and &s;prings of virtuous actions them&s;elves be
<PB N="141" REF="012811_0149_0F8ABFBD4E1A7170">
wrought into the mind in the &s;ame way, and by the &s;ame power? The &s;ame power that can form in the mind prin|ciples friendly to virtue, can doubtle&s;s create virtuous prin|ciples them&s;elves, in the very &s;ame way.</P>
<P>Mr. H. &s;peaking of his defective &s;ort of virtue, &s;ays,
<Q>There is an e&s;&s;ential defect in the agent, which renders him <HI>not well accepted.</HI> His action is <HI>e&s;&s;entially deficient,</HI> and <HI>can't be accepted,</HI> as an in&s;tance of true, divine vir|tue.</Q>
And yet he &s;ays in the &s;ame page
<Q>There is &s;omething in them which is right, and required by God. This is <HI>approved,</HI> not abhorred and thrown back as dung in the faces of the doers of them.</Q>
See p. 50, 51. This &s;eems to be no le&s;s than a contradiction. The &s;ame doings are not well accepted, and can't be accepted; and yet they are <HI>approved,</HI> i. e. are accepted; for I conclude <HI>accepted,</HI> and <HI>approved,</HI> mean the &s;ame thing. Be&s;ides, is it not very unrea&s;onable, and even daring pre&s;ump|tion, to &s;ay, that the infinitely holy God <HI>approves</HI> of that moral exerci&s;e and conduct, which is confe&s;&s;ed not to be of the nature of holine&s;s?</P>
<P>On the whole, Mr. H. in this chapter cen&s;ures them who repre&s;ent all the doings of the unregenerate, as having nothing in their nature but &s;in, and an abomination to God; and their be&s;t moral actions as altogether vicious, and in direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;pirit and law of God, &amp;c. But has offered no matter of conviction from &s;cripture or rea&s;on. Any judicious per&s;on who reads this chapter, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible how empty it is of any &s;hadow of argu|ment.</P>
<P>This middle character, this &s;ort of exerci&s;es and doings, which are neither &s;inful nor holy, are not known in the bi|ble; and is a meer chimera, full of incon&s;i&s;tencies. This, I tru&s;t, will appear to any one, who attends to the ac|count given, from the &s;cripture, of holine&s;s and &s;in, in the foregoing inquiry.

every one who has not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, is enmity again&s;t God, and his law, Rom. viii. 7, 8, 9. And Chri&s;t &s;ays, 'He that is not for me, is <HI>again&s;t me.</HI> Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or el&s;e make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt.' Mr. H. has not taken this advice; but has made the fruit of a tree, which he acknowledges to be corrupt, not corrupt, but good, even &s;o good as to be <HI>approved</HI> by God!</P>

In|ter&s;per&s;ed with remarks upon &s;ome things advanced by Dr. Bellamy and Mr. Hopkins, in the&s;e important points. By <HI>MOSES MATHER,</HI> A. M.</Q></HEAD>
<P>MR. Mather's 'repre&s;entation of &s;ome other go&s;pel doctrines,' is founded wholly on the account he gives of SELF-LOVE. If what he &s;ays of this is true, he has indeed made &s;ome new di&s;coveries; upon which he has built a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines. He &s;ays, as &s;elf-love is e&s;&s;ential to man, as a moral agent, Adam was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it in a &s;tate of perfect holine&s;s; and he had this &s;ame &s;elf-love when he had turned rebel again&s;t God. And as God was now become his enemy, and all the divine per|fections were again&s;t him, and &s;tood engaged to de&s;troy him, to love God in this &s;ituation, would be the &s;ame with loving his own mi&s;ery, and total de&s;truction: Which being contrary to his &s;elf-love, which God had implanted in him, it was naturally impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould love God. Nor was it his duty to love him, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, as it was not only impo&s;&s;ible, but contrary to the divine command; for he was commanded to love him&s;elf.
<PB N="144" REF="012811_0152_0F8ABFC2D77C8AF0">
And all Adam's po&s;terity are in much the &s;ame &s;tate he was in after the fall; &s;o that it is neither po&s;&s;ible for them, nor their duty, to love God, until they under&s;tand and believe the go&s;pel, which &s;ets the divine character in a new light, and oppo&s;ite to that in which it appears in the law, and declares his love and kindne&s;s to them. This di&s;covery and belief, will reconcile their hearts to God, &s;o that they cannot but love him, and embrace the go&s;pel from this &s;ame principle of &s;elf-love, from which, they, before this, nece&s;&s;arily hated God; and therefore need no new principle in their hearts, in order to turn to God, and become real chri&s;tians. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. M. does not expre&s;sly &s;ay it is the duty of men to <HI>hate</HI> God, before they believe the report of the go&s;pel; but this is nece&s;&s;arily implied in what he &s;ays: For the &s;ame &s;elf love which renders it im|po&s;&s;ible to love God, renders it equally impo&s;&s;ible not to hate him, while he is con&s;idered as di&s;po&s;ed to de&s;troy them. And if we are commanded to exerci&s;e this &s;elf-love, which is oppo&s;ed to God, this is the &s;ame with being commanded to oppo&s;e and hate him! Mr. M. thinks he has proved this &s;elf-love is commanded, from the words of the command, 'Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour <HI>as thy&s;elf.</HI>' This ar|gument has been confuted in the preceding inquiry. See p. 25.26.</NOTE> All this Mr. H. thinks he has demon&s;trated, by the help of <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> u&s;ing the word without any fixed, determinate meaning, and in dif|ferent &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>When he &s;ays &s;elf-love is e&s;&s;ential to man, as a moral agent, he means a general love of happine&s;s. But when he infers from this, that Adam's &s;elf-love, after he had &s;inned, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for him to love God, he means quite a different thing by &s;elf-love, viz. &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, which is mo&s;t properly called &s;elf-love. Nothing is therefore nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;ee the futility of all he &s;ays on this head, but to attend to what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, in the preceding inquiry, p. 19.&mdash;26.</P>
<P>When Adam &s;aw him&s;elf condemned by the law of God, &amp; all the divine perfections were again&s;t him, had he been a benevolent friend to the greate&s;t good of the whole,
<PB N="145" REF="012811_0153_0F8ABFC3655488A8">
he might, with the greate&s;t gu&s;t for happine&s;s, have placed his happine&s;s in the honor of God, as the greate&s;t good; and dreaded his di&s;honor, and an injury done to his go|vernment and kingdom, as the greate&s;t evil; and mo&s;t heartily &s;ay, 'Let God be glorified; let his government be maintained, and his kingdom flouri&s;h, whatever be|comes of me, or any other creature!' And he might have been plea&s;ed with God's perfections and law, as excellent and worthy to be loved and honored, though they were again&s;t him, and implied his de&s;truction; for their excel|lence appeared in this very thing. Nothing was incon|&s;i&s;tent with this but that <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> in which all his rebel|lion con&s;i&s;ted. In &s;hort, nothing was in the way of A|dam's loving God, in this &s;tate, but his &s;in, con&s;i&s;ting in a di&s;po&s;ition to love him&s;elf only, and exalt him&s;elf above God, which was implied and acted out in his fir&s;t rebel|lion. And it <HI>this</HI> rendered it not his duty to love God, and made hatred of him no crime; then his fir&s;t rebel|lion was no &s;in; and there never was, nor will be, any &s;uch thing as &s;in: For every one that rebels again&s;t God, does it in the exerci&s;e of that <HI>&s;elf-love</HI> which is contrary to loving and obeying him.</P>
<P>Mr. M. by the help of his <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> al&s;o undertakes to &s;hew that what I have publi&s;hed concerning the &s;tate and character of the unregenerate cannot be true. I have repre&s;ented an unregenerate &s;inner, who is awaken|ed to fearful apprehen&s;ions of the wrath to come, and has a painful &s;en&s;e of his continual expo&s;edne&s;s to it; and is convinced in his con&s;cience that &s;alvation is freely offered to him; and that 'tis his duty and highe&s;t inte|re&s;t to embrace the offer and return home to God, that in this way and no other, he may e&s;cape the evil he dreads and be eternally happy; under all this light and convic|tion of con&s;cience, yet ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing to embrace the go&s;pel, and his heart ri&s;ing again&s;t God more directly and with greater &s;trength than it did before he had this conviction, in horrid exerci&s;es of hatred, enmity and fixed

oppo&s;ition to God's character and government. Mr. M. &s;ays this is impo&s;&s;ible, as 'tis contrary to &s;elf-love; that human nature is not capable of acting &s;uch a part; as this would be di&s;intere&s;ted malice; yea more, '&s;uch a fixed, inveterate malice, as overcomes all regard to his own happine&s;s in the &s;inner's heart.' (p. 15)</P>
<P>ANS. Upon the principle on which Mr. Mather op|po&s;es me here, the &s;inner always heartily complies with what his judgment and con&s;cience are convinced is for his intere&s;t: For if his heart may, in any in&s;tance, refu&s;e to embrace what he is convinced in his con&s;cience would be for his intere&s;t to embrace, he may do &s;o in any in&s;tance, even in the in&s;tance before us. And all Mr. M. &s;ays is again&s;t the former, as much as the latter.&mdash;But that the former is true, none will deny. Is there no in&s;tance, in our world, of a per&s;on's refu&s;ing to comply with what he was convinced, in his con&s;cience was his duty, and for his own intere&s;t? Are there not innumerable in&s;tances of this every day? Yea, have we not all a witne&s;s in our own brea&s;ts, that our hearts, in many in&s;tances, have not con|formed to the dictates of our con&s;ciences; but have refu|&s;ed to love and embrace that which we have been con|vinced in our con&s;ciences, would be for our highe&s;t inte|re&s;t to love and embrace? Mr. M. is not &s;uch a &s;tranger to mankind, and to him&s;elf, as to be in&s;en&s;ible of this, I conclude. And if a man's heart may oppo&s;e his con&s;ci|ence telling him what is mo&s;t for his intere&s;t in one in&s;tance, it may in another, and in any &s;uppo&s;able ca&s;e what&s;oever. Does Mr. M. think that nothing is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to the conver&s;ion of a &s;inner, but to convince his judgment and con&s;cience, that 'tis for his intere&s;t to embrace the go&s;pel? And that all who have this conviction are certain|ly converted and &s;aved? Surely he does not. Why then has he &s;uppo&s;ed it in his oppo&s;ition to the propo&s;ition un|der con&s;ideration?</P>
<P>And when a &s;inner's heart exerci&s;es it&s;elf, as in the ca&s;e before us, it &s;uppo&s;es no di&s;intere&s;ted malice, or any thing
<PB N="147" REF="012811_0155_0F8ABFC4CCD52418">
contrary to the greate&s;t degree of &s;elf-love: Yea, 'tis pure|ly from &s;elf-love, and becau&s;e his heart is under the dominion of this, that he thus oppo&s;es the dictates of his con&s;cience, and hates God, his law and government, Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel: And that becau&s;e all the&s;e are contrary to &s;elf-love. The &s;inner's heart mu&s;t cea&s;e from loving him&s;elf wholly, and love God &s;upremely, and excerci&s;e that benevolence which loves and &s;eeks the glory of God and the general good, in order to be willing to embrace the go&s;pel. This the &s;elfi&s;h or unregenerate heart is fixed in oppo&s;ition to; and the more clear conviction he has in his con&s;cience, that 'tis for his intere&s;t to love God, &amp;c. and the more his con&s;cience is convinced of the truths re&s;pecting the divine character, the nature and true import of the go&s;pel; the more fully will he find the&s;e things to be contrary to his heart, or his &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; and con&s;equently the more &s;trong and vigorous will be the oppo&s;ition of his heart to them.</P>
<P>The pride of a man's heart may oppo&s;e true humility, and be the only rea&s;on of his ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing to &s;ub|mit to it; while under a conviction of con&s;cience, that to be humble is the only way to be truly happy and honor|able. The pride of a man's heart, which, at bottom, is nothing but &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;eeks honor and happine&s;s which are not the honor and happine&s;s that attend humility; but of a different and oppo&s;ite kind: And his being convinced in con&s;cience, that in oppo&s;ing humility he op|po&s;es the greate&s;t good, will not alter the ta&s;te and bent of his heart, or render the honor and happine&s;s that attend humility any more agreeable to his pride, than they were before. The proud heart will oppo&s;e humility at all times, and under all imaginable convictions of con&s;cience. So the &s;elfi&s;h heart will oppo&s;e benevolence, and every thing that implies it, whatever conviction of con&s;cience there may be, that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is the &s;ource of continual mi&s;ery, and that the benevolent are only happy. You may convince the con&s;cience of the covetous mi&s;er, that 'tis his

duty, and for his intere&s;t, to be charitable and liberal; as with &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition he would enjoy him&s;elf more, and have more comfort in what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and hereby lay up immen&s;e, eternal riches. But would this certainly make his &s;elfi&s;h, covetous heart charitable and liberal; or do any thing towards it? It might induce him to give &s;omething to the poor; but &s;o far as he is influenced to this by meer &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, it would be as far from charity, and as really oppo&s;ite to it, as were any of his former exerci&s;es. How then, it will be a&s;ked, &s;hall this &s;elfi&s;h churl become liberal? <HI>An&s;.</HI> Not meerly by being convinced, in his judgment, that to be liberal is the only way to become truly rich and happy; and hence from his &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s de|&s;iring and attempting to be liberal: For all &s;uch de&s;ires are, by &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ires and attempts, and as op|po&s;ite to liberality as were his former de&s;ires and attempts: But by having a new heart given him, a truly benevo|lent, liberal, bountiful heart.</P>
<P>Mr. M. &s;ays (p. 14. marg.)
<Q>If the enmity of our hearts is really a principle of <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted malice,</HI> it mu&s;t be owned, that the more it is oppo&s;ed by the light, and convictions of con&s;cience, it will work in our hearts af|ter the manner here de&s;cribed;</Q>
[i. e. the more light and conviction the con&s;cience has, the higher will the fixed hatred and oppo&s;ition of the heart ri&s;e again&s;t God] and he grants that, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, 'no light and convicti|on of con&s;cience can humble, &s;ubdue and convert, the heart:' And 'that therefore regeneration is the effect of mere and immediate divine power.'</P>
<P>I am as confident as Mr. M. or any one el&s;e can be, that there is no &s;uch thing in nature, as <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted malice.</HI> And if it can be made to appear that any thing I have a&s;|&s;erted concerning the unregenerate, implies any &s;uch thing, I am ready to retract it. All &s;inful exerci&s;es are intere&s;t|ed and &s;elfi&s;h: All &s;in con&s;i&s;ts in &s;elf-love, and tho&s;e af|fections that are implied in it, and flow from it. There is properly no di&s;intere&s;ted affection but that in which holi|ne&s;s
<PB N="149" REF="012811_0157_0F8ABFC64B2C2738">
con&s;i&s;ts. This has been proved in the foregoing in|quiry.</P>
<P>And why is not the exertion of mere and immediate power, as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubdue the heart which is under the power of this &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, as if it was full of di&s;intere&s;ted malice? And how will conviction of con&s;cience remove the former, and turn it into benevolence, any more than the latter? I believe none can give any rea&s;on for this. I think therefore Mr. M. has really granted the whole I have a&s;&s;erted, by his conce&s;&s;ion under con&s;ideration. Self|i&s;hne&s;s is as oppo&s;ite to holine&s;s, or di&s;intere&s;ted benevo|lence, in its whole nature, and all its exerci&s;es, as di&s;inte|re&s;ted malice could be, if any &s;uch thing were po&s;&s;ible: And the former is as &s;trong and fixed a principle as the latter could be. Let any one give a good rea&s;on why di&s;intere&s;ted malice, were this po&s;&s;ible, might not be remo|ved by light, or conviction of con&s;cience, and that mere and immediate divine power is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubdue and convert &s;uch a heart, and it will be as good a rea&s;on why all this mu&s;t be true of a heart wholly under the dominion of that &s;elf-love which is mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to holine&s;s of any thing in nature, and indeed the only thing in the heart that can oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>This brings the matter in di&s;pute to a point; and may lead us to &s;ee what is the ground of our difference on this head. It has its foundation in different notions of the nature of true holine&s;s, and &s;o, of God's moral character, which is the &s;um, and partern of all true holi|ne&s;s. If the true &s;criptural holine&s;s has been de&s;cribed in the foregoing inquiry, then all mu&s;t grant, that what I have advanced about the &s;tate and character of the unre|generate, and the nece&s;&s;ity of 'mere and immediate di|vine power,' to change the &s;inner's heart, mu&s;t be true, &amp; agreeable to &s;cripture. Mr. Hart acknowledges this (p. 23. marg.) and Mr. M. implicitly acknowledges it in the pa&s;&s;age now under con&s;ideration. The truth is, if holi|ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, in whole, or in part, in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or if this
<PB N="150" REF="012811_0158_0F8ABFC708E5E4A0">
is in any degree friendly to true holine&s;s, and does not oppo&s;e it; then he who has all po&s;&s;ible depravity, may be recovered to holine&s;s, without any immediate, divine power exerted to change his heart: Nothing is needful in order to this, but to have his con&s;cience inlightened to &s;ee what holine&s;s is, how agreeable it is to his &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and &s;uited to gratify it; and what kindne&s;s and wonder|ful love God exerci&s;es towards him; which is &s;uited to affect &amp; win his &s;elfi&s;h heart, and draw forth &s;trong exer|ci&s;es of love to them that love him; while God requires nothing of him that is not perfectly agreeable to &s;elf-love; I &s;ay, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, nothing is needful in or|der to conver&s;ion, but that light and conviction of con|&s;cience, which &s;hall bring the&s;e things into clear view.</P>
<P>But then it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, &s;uch a conver&s;ion is re|ally no change of heart at all, 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed that the per|fectly &s;elfi&s;h heart is di&s;po&s;ed to love God and holine&s;s, and embrace the go&s;pel, whenever they are truly and properly &s;et before it; and love to God and holine&s;s, and embracing the go&s;pel, are nothing but &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s exer|ci&s;ed toward the&s;e things: And all religion and holine&s;s is nothing but &s;elf-love, and what &s;prings from this root: And that di&s;intere&s;ted affection, which has been &s;poken of, as oppo&s;ite to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and as that in which all true holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, is no part of holine&s;s; but a mere chi|mera, being as contrary and impo&s;&s;ible to human nature, as di&s;intere&s;ted malice. Here lies the great difference between us, even in our different and oppo&s;ite notions of the nature of holine&s;s, and of the divine, moral character. If we were agreed in this, we &s;hould be agreed in our no|tions about total depravity; the &s;tate and character of the unregenerate, regeneration, &amp;c. Mr. M. makes the total depravity of fallen man, <HI>primarily</HI> and <HI>radically,</HI> to con&s;i&s;t in his incapacity of loving God, becau&s;e this was in that &s;tate, contrary to &s;elf-love, together with the darkne&s;s that was on his mind. But this cannot proper|ly be called depravity, as it is not in the lea&s;t degree &s;in|ful;
<PB N="151" REF="012811_0159_0F8ABFCCB7C392E0">
it being naturally impo&s;&s;ible, and &s;o not his duty to love God in the&s;e circum&s;tances. But if it were allowed to be &s;inful depravity in &s;ome degree, it can't be <HI>total de|pravity,</HI> according to Mr. M. for this his &s;elf-love was a good thing, even a duty which was commanded in the divine law; and it was ready to flow out in love to God, whenever he &s;hould be revealed in a truly amiable light, even as the kind &s;aviour of &s;inners. According to this, &s;elf-love is it&s;elf holine&s;s, and that in which it radically and &s;ummarily con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid (&s;ermon on regen. p. 42. marg.) that the doctrines of the total corruption of man, and regeneration by light in the under&s;tanding, were incon&s;i&s;tent with each other. And no one has yet proved the contrary: But the evidence of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion rather increa&s;|es, in that all who undertake to vindicate this notion of regeneration do, in order to do it, really deny total de|pravity. If &s;elf-love is &s;o friendly to holine&s;s, and &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential ingredient in it, that when the con&s;cience is properly inlightened, this &s;ame &s;elf love, will grow up, and act out, in all the branches of holy love; then man is not totally depraved; for he has this good principle in him, which being cultivated will grow up into all holi|ne&s;s. But if &s;elf-love is, in every degree of it, oppo&s;ed to holine&s;s, and that in which human depravity con&s;i&s;ts, and fallen man is wholly under the power of this; and the more &s;trongly this is exerted, the more he oppo&s;es God and holine&s;s; then no degree of light and convic|tion of con&s;cience will change his heart, or produce new and oppo&s;ite principles there: But the more light and conviction is in the con&s;cience, the more clearly the hate|ful object, holine&s;s, is &s;et before the mind; the more di|rectly and vigorou&s;ly will &s;elf-love hate and oppo&s;e it. This all will grant, on the &s;uppo&s;ition made. So that the di&s;pute really is, whether man is totally depraved; and what true holine&s;s is: Whether it is oppo&s;ed to &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s; or whether &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s it&s;elf, is not friendly to it?
<PB N="152" REF="012811_0160_0F8ABFCED1A87260">
The di&s;pute therefore is to be determined by determining what true holine&s;s is. If the foregoing is a true and &s;criptural account of it, the controver&s;y is decided, by the confe&s;&s;ion of all. I hope therefore in all di&s;putes on this head, for the future, that which at bottom is in que&s;tion, will be kept in view, viz. What is holine&s;s? What is the divine character? What is God?&mdash;If we can be agreed in this, we &s;hall agree in all the re&s;t.</P>

<Q>But Solomon did not apprehend that natural corruption would ri&s;e the high|er, the more it is oppo&s;ed (Prov xx. 15) <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction &s;hall drive it far from him.</HI>&mdash;If then this corruption does not nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e the higher, the more it is oppo&s;ed; but does &s;ometimes yield; why may we not &s;uppo&s;e that the father of our &s;pirits, through light, powerfully impre&s;&s;ed on the con&s;cience by the holy &s;pirit, may ob|tain a more complete victory over this corruption, than ever is obtained by human correction; even &s;o as that it may be truly mortified?</Q></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this it may be ob&s;erved, if the&s;e words prove any thing again&s;t the doctrines I have advanced, they prove too much; more than Mr. M. him&s;elf will grant; or can be true, con&s;i&s;tent with the whole current of &s;cripture. If fooli&s;hne&s;s means natural corruption in general, and the rod of correction will drive it <HI>far</HI> from him; then it is overcome and mortified; and there is no need of any thing el&s;e, in order to effect it, or to obtain a more complete victory over this corruption, than is ob|tained by the rod of correction. If the rod of correction will remove, and &s;ubdue this corruption in any degree, no rea&s;on can be given why it may not wholly remove and &s;ubdue it. Therefore, the con&s;equence from the words is this, 'If then the natural corruption of the heart does yield and will &s;ubmit under the di&s;cipline of the rod, why may we not &s;uppo&s;e, yea, be certain, that the rod of correction, properly and powerfully applied, will ob|tain
<PB N="153" REF="012811_0161_0F8ABFD0F0C0F500">
a complete victory over it?' If this rea&s;oning is not ju&s;t, neither is Mr. Mather's.</P>
<P>The&s;e words may be taken in three different &s;en&s;es; and let which will be the right, neither of them are to Mr. Mather's purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the rod of correction, may be meant the whole of parental di&s;cipline and education. This, when wi&s;ely and faithfully admini&s;tered and practi&s;ed, may, by divine con&s;titution and promi&s;e, be connected with the deliverance of the child from &s;in; &s;o that God's ble&s;&s;ing and his giv|ing a new heart to a child, is the certain attendant or fruit of &s;uch education and di&s;cipline. In this &s;en&s;e the words in the 6th ver&s;e of this chap. may be under&s;tood, 'Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.' And agreeable to this, it is expre&s;sly &s;aid (chap. xxiii. 13, 14.) 'Withhold not cor|rection from the child. Thou &s;halt beat him with the rod, and &s;halt deliver his &s;oul from hell.' If God has promi&s;ed to the child which is faithfully and wi&s;ely edu|cated, under parental di&s;cipline, and brought up <HI>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</HI> deliverance from &s;in and hell; this does not determine any thing about the manner in which God effects this, whether he gives a new heart by light, or immediate divine influence. And it is con&s;i&s;tent with the child's being more perver&s;e, and his corruption ri&s;ing higher and growing &s;tronger under di&s;cipline, if God's ble&s;&s;ing &s;hould be witheld.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the&s;e words, with the others ju&s;t mentioned, on|ly import, that this is a proper means, and the likelie&s;t way to turn a child from &s;in, and promote his &s;alvation, they determine nothing with regard to the matter in di&s;|pute.</P>
<P N="3">3. If by <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> is here meant, not corruption of heart in general, but tho&s;e particular exerci&s;es and out|breakings of it, in which children are &s;tubborn and rebel|lious, and impatient of re&s;traint; by which they &s;hew their folly, and render them&s;elves di&s;agreeable and trou|ble&s;ome
<PB N="154" REF="012811_0162_0F8ABFD19DA7F6F8">
to all who have any &s;pecial connexion with them: Children may, by a wi&s;e parental government, be cured of this folly; it may be driven far from them, and they, as to their external appearance and conduct, be quite different from tho&s;e who have no education, or a bad one. The many examples of this are &s;ufficient to confirm this ob&s;ervation. But this di&s;cipline, by which children are thus formed, does not eradicate or &s;ubdue the corrupt principles of their hearts. The corruption of their hearts is re&s;trained from acting out in that parti|cular way, and is turned into &s;ome other channel; and may act with as much &s;trength another way, and more. It will do &s;o, unle&s;s the heart be renewed by the &s;pirit of God.</P>
<P>Mr. M. here refers to pre&s;ident Edwards's book on freedom of will, and &s;ays,
<Q>The whole de&s;ign of that book is to prove, that <HI>the will is as the greate&s;t appa|rent good is.</HI> All the arguments there offered, mu&s;t be confuted, before this character here given of the &s;inner can be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</Q>
P. 13.</P>
<P>ANS. Pre&s;ident Edwards does not attempt to prove, nor &s;ay, that the will always is, according to the convic|tion and dictates of the judgement and con&s;cience, with re|&s;pect to what is be&s;t, and mo&s;t for a per&s;on's intere&s;t: But he &s;ays directly the contrary, p. 12. And the whole that he &s;ays in &s;hewing that the will is as the greate&s;t ap|parent good, &s;hews that he does not mean the appearance that is made to the judgment and con&s;cience only; but to 'the whole faculty of perception or apprehen&s;ion, and not meerly what is called <HI>rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>judgment.</HI>' He &s;up|po&s;es the heart may be &s;uch as to re&s;i&s;t the cleare&s;t dic|tates of con&s;cience; &s;o that what this dictates to be mo&s;t for his intere&s;t, &s;hall not be the greate&s;t apparent good; but &s;omething directly oppo&s;ite. If pre&s;ident Edwards had &s;aid any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with this, it would be contrary to known fact and univer&s;al experience.</P>
<P>To the &s;elfi&s;h heart, that which &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s dictates is
<PB N="155" REF="012811_0163_0F8ABFD2557531D0">
the greate&s;t apparent good, and not what rea&s;on and con|&s;cience dictate. Therefore, to &s;uch an heart, <HI>that</HI> is al|ways the greate&s;t apparent good, which oppo&s;es univer|&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence. If &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is agreeable to it&s;elf, and a &s;elfi&s;h good is to this the greate&s;t apparent good; then this benevolence is di&s;agreeable, and it oppo|&s;es and hates this and the highe&s;t good which it &s;eeks, as the greate&s;t evil. Mr. M. &s;peaking of Adam in his fal|len &s;tate &s;ays,
<Q>He having now a &s;eparate intere&s;t from God, there was of cour&s;e contrariety to the divine cha|racter, &s;o far forth as that &s;tood in oppo&s;ition to his own &s;eparate intere&s;t.</Q>
P. 15. The &s;elfi&s;h man always has a &s;eparate intere&s;t from God. This is the very nature of &s;elf-love, it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;etting up a &s;eparate intere&s;t from God; and therefore is of cour&s;e, in its nature, con|trariety &amp; enmity to the divine character; for this always did, and always will &s;tand in direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;epa|rate intere&s;t of a &s;elfi&s;h man. And this &s;eparate intere&s;t will be the greate&s;t apparent good to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, what|ever rea&s;on and con&s;cience may dictate to the contrary.</P>
<P>Mr. M. thinks the doctrines about regeneration, &amp;c. which he is oppo&s;ing, originated from what pre&s;ident Ed|wards has advanced in his treati&s;e on religious affections; where he repre&s;ents holine&s;s and the exerci&s;es of it, as &s;omething of a different nature from any thing that takes place in unholy men; and &s;ays that in the&s;e holy ex|erci&s;es and affections, 'there is a new inward perception or &s;en&s;ation of the minds of holy per&s;ons, entirely differ|ent, in its nature and kind, from any thing that ever their minds were the &s;ubjects of before they were &s;anctified;' which he calls 'a new &s;piritual &s;en&s;e.' P. 35, &amp;c. This, Mr. M. thinks, is a great error, and of a very bad tenden|cy; it being the &s;ource of a &s;et of doctrines, which he calls '<HI>new divinity,</HI>' which &s;ays he, 'are &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;pread in the land, in the pre&s;ent day.' P. 36, &amp;c.</P>
<P>No wonder Mr. M. objects again&s;t this, &s;eeing if it is true, it overthrows all his divinity at once. According to
<PB N="156" REF="012811_0164_0F8ABFD32E7E5030">
him, the &s;ame &s;elf-love which in unholy men is incon&s;i&s;tent with their loving God, and leads them to hate and oppo&s;e him, is a principle of holine&s;s in the &s;aints; and is really exerci&s;ed in true love to God, when their eyes are opened to &s;ee that his character is favourable to their own dear &s;elves; and that they had been under a &s;ad mi&s;take all their days before: So that holine&s;s does not differ, in nature and kind, from unholine&s;s or &s;in. But it holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in benevolence, and the affection implied in it, and this is in its nature different from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and op|po&s;ed to it, what Mr. Edwards &s;ays of holy affections mu&s;t be true. So that we &s;till &s;ee the di&s;pute is about the nature of holine&s;s, or what is God's moral character. If we were agreed about this, it would end the contro|ver&s;y.</P>
<P>Mr. M. makes three objections again&s;t Mr. Edwards's doctrine on this head.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> He &s;ays, 'If regeneration is &s;uch a change as is here de&s;cribed, it is evidently not a moral, but a <HI>phy&s;ical change.</HI>' His argument is this: Giving this new, &s;piritu|al &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, is the &s;ame with giving a new bodily &s;en&s;e, or opening the eyes of the blind; but this would be a phy&s;ical change; therefore the giving this ta&s;te is a phy&s;ical change.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. The &s;criptures, &s;peaking of this change, re|pre&s;ent it by giving eyes to &s;ee, a being turned from darkne&s;s to marvellous light, giving a new heart, the new creature, or new creation, a being rai&s;ed from death to life, &amp;c. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions as &s;trongly import a phy&s;ical change as does Mr. Edwards's de&s;cription of it, and are therefore as liable to Mr. M's objection. Mr. M. tho't of this, and &s;aid,
<Q>I am &s;en&s;ible that very <HI>&s;trong</HI> expre&s;&s;i|ons are u&s;ed in the &s;cripture about this change; it is &s;tyled a <HI>new creation,</HI> &amp;c. but if regeneration is no other than a moral change, then tho&s;e &s;trong &s;cripture ex|pre&s;&s;ions will not warrant us to de&s;cribe it as a phy&s;ical change.</Q>
P. 40. The&s;e &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ions are full
<PB N="157" REF="012811_0165_0F8ABFD3CD28C640">
as &s;trong as Mr. Edwards's: What warrant then had Mr. M to &s;ay <HI>his</HI> import a phy&s;ical change, when he owns he has none to put &s;uch a con&s;truction on the &s;cripture? He has not offered a word to &s;hew why Mr. Edwards's de&s;cription of this change does make it a phy&s;ical change, which will not equally prove that the de&s;cription of it in &s;cripture makes it &s;o.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. What does Mr. M. mean by a <HI>phy&s;ical change?</HI> I think he has not &s;ufficiently explained him&s;elf, Mr. Ed|wards expre&s;sly &s;ays he does not mean, by his new, &s;piritu|al &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, any thing which implies any new natu|ral faculties of the &s;oul, of under&s;tanding and will; but that it con&s;i&s;ts in a new di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ame will, or af|fection of heart. And if this is not a moral change, and nothing el&s;e, let Mr. M. &s;hew why it is not, and tell what a moral change is, and what he means by it. A moral change is a change of the heart or will, in which it is di&s;|po&s;ed to hate what it before loved, and to love and chu&s;e tho&s;e objects to which it before had an aver&s;ion, with a new kind of &s;en&s;ation or love, which it never had before. And will not Mr. Mather allow that men pa&s;s a change like this in regeneration and conver&s;ion? A phy&s;ical change is a change of the natural faculties of the &s;oul, or giving new natural faculties: But this is no more implied in the change Mr. E. de&s;cribes, than in that which Mr. M. &s;uppo&s;es takes place in regeneration. And Mr. E. expre&s;sly declares he does not mean any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>Mr. M. &s;ays,
<Q>If God &s;hould give &s;ight to one that was born blind, we &s;hould readily agree that the change wrought in him was phy&s;ical, and not a moral change: And it is equally evident, that it is a real phy&s;ical change which is here de&s;cribed by Mr. Edwards. And to de&s;cribe regeneration as a proper phy&s;ical change, and then &s;ay, <HI>we don't mean &s;o,</HI> is only to bewilder our|&s;elves and our readers about that important change.</Q>
P. 39. It appears that Mr. M. has bewildered him&s;elf
<PB N="158" REF="012811_0166_0F8ABFD497861458">
by not &s;ufficiently attending to the matter, and not di&s;|tingui&s;hing between a change of the heart, in which a new inclination takes place there, which was not there before, and that change in which a new natural faculty is given, in which the heart is not in the lea&s;t concerned. This appears by the in&s;tance he brings. He has bewildered him&s;elf in not di&s;tingui&s;hing between a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, which con&s;i&s;ts in the di&s;po&s;ition or affection of the heart, and our bodily &s;en&s;es. If a man who has always been wholly contracted and &s;elfi&s;h in all his views, de&s;igns and pur&s;uits, becomes benevolent and generous, in a hearty love of God and his neighbour, placing all his happine&s;s in the glory of God, and the greate&s;t good of the creation, he is turned from darkne&s;s to marvellous light, and has a &s;et of &s;en&s;ations that are quite new, and oppo&s;ite to any thing he had before. But is this therefore a phy&s;ical change? It is altogether of a moral kind, if there is any &s;uch thing as moral change. Now this is the change Mr. Edwards de&s;cribes.</P>
<P>ANS. 3. Mr. M's regeneration has much more of the appearance of a phy&s;ical change, then that which Mr. Edwards de&s;cribes, and will be found to be really &s;uch, I believe, if examined. He &s;uppo&s;es the change, as wrought by God, to be wholly in the under&s;tanding, con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from the will, and to con&s;i&s;t in giving a new &s;et of ideas, in which the will or heart is not concerned, and which could not take place, however well di&s;po&s;ed the heart is, as they are entirely independent of any di&s;po&s;ition of heart. Now this is no more a moral change than any other change what&s;oever.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> Mr. M. &s;ays, 'If regeneration is &s;uch a phy&s;i|cal change, the &s;inner is &s;o far from being to blame for his continuing in an unregenerate &s;tate, that he is wholly excu&s;ed from all blame. P. 39.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. This is granted, <HI>if</HI> regeneration is a phy&s;ical change, i. e. is a change not of the di&s;po&s;ition of heart, but &s;omething el&s;e independent of this. But Mr. Ed|wards
<PB N="159" REF="012811_0167_0F8ABFD5543ADD10">
de&s;cribes no &s;uch change, but only a change of heart, which con&s;i&s;ts wholly in new &s;en&s;ations and affecti|ons, in which it turns from &s;in to God.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. This objection is made with an ill grace by Mr. M. For though it is groundle&s;s, as made again&s;t Mr. Edwards, it lies with full force again&s;t him&s;elf, and all who hold that men are regenerated by light, and not by giving a new ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition of heart.&mdash;For, accord|ing to them the difficulty of the &s;inner's for&s;aking &s;in, and turning to God, does not properly lie in the heart or will; but in the under&s;tanding, which being blinded, does not &s;ee divine objects in a true light. This is the only cau&s;e of their continuing unregenerate; and not any thing wrong or blamable in the will. The fault is wholly in the under&s;tanding; and this is a blamele&s;s fault or defect, for the will or heart has no hand in it; and can no more help or remove it, however well inclined, than a blind man can re&s;tore him|&s;elf to &s;ight. All that hold to regeneration by light, without any immediate divine influence on the will, may be challenged to &s;hew how men are wholly to blame for continuing in a &s;tate of unregeneracy, or that this is any crime at all. They never can do it: Nor can they tell how this is con&s;i&s;tent with total depravity; for this is al|ways implicitly, if not expre&s;sly, denied, in all they &s;ay in vindication of their &s;cheme.</P>
<P>But Mr. M. has gone beyond all others on this head, and expre&s;sly declared that Adam was, in his fallen &s;tate, under a natural impo&s;&s;ibility of loving God, and that his total depravity, which is the &s;ame with a &s;tate of unregene|racy, primarily and radically con&s;i&s;ted in this, together with the darkne&s;s that was upon his mind: And that this is the ca&s;e with his po&s;terity. How then can they be to blame for continuing in this &s;tate, which is wholly owing to their external circum&s;tances, and a natural impo&s;&s;ibility they are under of being otherwi&s;e? And yet this &s;ame Mr. M. thinks it is a &s;ufficient objection
<PB N="160" REF="012811_0168_0F8ABFD61E85ACC8">
again&s;t Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme, if it is incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;inners being to blame for continuing in a &s;tate of unre|generacy!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> Mr. M. &s;ays, 'If regeneration is &s;uch a <HI>phy|&s;ical change,</HI> it will follow that every regenerate per&s;on mu&s;t have the mo&s;t certain knowledge of it.' P. 39.</P>
<P>ANS. It is not a phy&s;ical change. But if it were, why mu&s;t the &s;ubjects of it be more certain of the change, than if it were a moral change? The exerci&s;es and affec|tions of the heart are as perceptible, as any thing that can take place in the mind. And when, in this re&s;pect, all old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things are become new, and a per&s;on is called out of darkne&s;s into marvel|lous light; this change is in its own nature as perceiva|ble, and the &s;ubject may be as &s;ure of it, if called moral, as if it were called phy&s;ical; and it's being really a moral or phy&s;ical change, alters nor the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the evidence or certain knowledge of it.</P>
<P>The only rea&s;on that can be given why every per&s;on that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of real holine&s;s (let him come by it how he will, and whatever may be the change that brought him to it) has not the certain knowledge of it, is, that he has &s;o &s;mall a degree of it, and is no more changed, and con|formed to God; and &s;o much darkne&s;s and &s;in &s;till re|main in his heart.&mdash;But it is needle&s;s to &s;pend time to an&s;wer &s;uch an objection: It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay by what means it was &s;ugge&s;ted to Mr. Mather, and why he thought it worthy to be in&s;erted.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN my reply to Mr. Mills, I had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider the duties of the unregenerate, which he &s;poke &s;o much of, as required of them, and performed by them, while unholy and under the dominion of &s;in. And I un|dertook to prove that &s;uch <HI>do not do any duty,</HI> or comply with any of the commands which God hath given to men. Mr. Hemmenway had, not long before, publi&s;hed &s;even &s;ermons, which were de&s;igned to prove and inculcate the contrary doctrine; and were wholly confuted, if I had proved the point I had advanced. This was probably the occa&s;ion of his more particularly attending to what I had &s;aid in this part of my reply, and undertaking to write again&s;t me.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="012811_0170_0F8ABFD78EAD0CB0">As I am far from being convinced that what he pleads for is agreeable to divine revelation, and look upon it of a very hurtful tendency; I have undertaken an an&s;wer. It is thrown into the form of an appendix to the foregoing inquiry, becau&s;e what is there &s;aid, is, in my opinion, a full an&s;wer to the leading &s;entiments and fun|damental principle in his piece; &s;o that, by refering to that, the an&s;wer may be much &s;hortened.</P>
<P>After having ob&s;erved that I had not given a right re|pre&s;entation of the que&s;tion in di&s;pute, he proceeds to &s;tate it in the following words:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though Mr. H&mdash;y did not choo&s;e to di&s;pute the que&s;tion as I &s;tated it, I yet believe it was &s;tated agreeable to the &s;en&s;e of mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have a&s;&s;erted that duties are pre&s;cribed in the word of God, to be done by tho&s;e who are in a &s;tate of unregeneracy. And it will, I believe, appear to be his own &s;en&s;e of the matter before we have done. But I think it not worth while to enter into a di&s;pute about this, &s;ince he owns 'the whole drift of my rea&s;oning is to op|po&s;e and confute' the affirmative of the que&s;tion, as he has &s;tated it, p. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Whether any actions which men do, or can perform, while unregenerate, are required of them in and by a divine command?</HI> He a&s;&s;erts and under|takes to prove the affirmative of this que&s;tion; and has wrote a book upon it of two hundred and twenty-&s;even pages. If I was to &s;tate the que&s;tion in my own words, I &s;hould &s;ay, it was, <HI>Whether the unregenerate do any duty which God has commanded?</HI> But as Mr. H&mdash;y appears to mean nothing different from this, by the words he has u&s;ed, and to under&s;tand the real matter in di&s;pute between us; I &s;hall make no ex|ceptions again&s;t his &s;tate of the que&s;tion; but proceed to con&s;ider his vindication. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have an objection again&s;t the title he has given his book, viz. <HI>A vindication of the power, obligation and encouragement of the unre|generate to attend the means of grace, again&s;t</HI> the exceptions <HI>of the Rev.

I have not made any <HI>exceptions</HI> again&s;t the power, obligations and encourage|ment of the unregenerate to attend the means of grace, that I know of, but held to all this, as fully as he does. And I think more fully: For he does not pretend they have <HI>power</HI> to do this in the manner he contends for, unle&s;s they have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit of God: Whereas I &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>&s;ecure &s;inner</HI> has this power. And he acknowledges I grant, they have <HI>encouragement</HI> to attend on means, and that he has no di&s;pute with me about this, p. 3.

<PB N="163" REF="012811_0171_0F8ABFD8535372E0">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> The point in controver&s;y more particularly &s;tated: The me|thod Mr. H&mdash;y takes to &s;upport his cau&s;e: Its weak|ne&s;s and fallacy &s;hewn.</HEAD>
<P>MR. H&mdash;y agrees with me, that the divine com|mands require holine&s;s, and nothing but holine&s;s; or 'nothing but what is &s;ome way included in holine&s;s.' P. 3. And we are agreed that the unregenerate are wholly de&s;titute of holine&s;s, and that all their exerci&s;es and actions are unholy. I &s;uppo&s;ed the plain and unde|niable con&s;equence from the&s;e premi&s;es was, that they do not obey the divine commands, or do their duty in any degree. Mr. H&mdash;y denies this to be a ju&s;t con&s;equence; and &s;ays, 'though no actions of the unregenerate are &s;o fully conformable to the divine command, as that they can be denominated holy in the lea&s;t degree;&mdash;yet &s;ome actions are conformable to the divine command, in &s;ome re&s;pects, and therefore comprehended in the requirement of it.' P. 4. To vindicate this, and an&s;wer what has been &s;aid in oppo&s;ition to it, is the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of his book.</P>
<P>In order to this, he particularly con&s;iders the nature of true holine&s;s, and what is included in this. He &s;ays, holine&s;s is a very complex thing, containing many parts; all which are nece&s;&s;ary to make up that compound holi|ne&s;s. Therefore, the commands which require holine&s;s,
<PB N="164" REF="012811_0172_0F8ABFD90E0AD940">
require every part which is involved in the whole. That the unregenerate may do &s;ome of the things contained in this compound, and &s;o far obey the command requiring holine&s;s; though it being but a part, &s;uch doings, being &s;o defective, have no degree of true holine&s;s; yet in do|ing this, they do their duty, and &s;o far obey the divine command.</P>
<P>To prove that there are &s;ome parts of duty and holi|ne&s;s which the unregenerate may perform, and yet be unholy, he divides holine&s;s into principle, end, manner and matter. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mr. H&mdash;y makes many more di&s;tinctions, divi&s;ions and &s;ubdivi|&s;ions, in what he &s;ays about the nature of holine&s;s, and &s;ays a num|ber of things, which appear to me very exceptionable: But as they do not effect the matter in di&s;pute, I &s;hall make no remarks upon them. Let him who under&s;tands and approves, avail him&s;elf of the edification. Wherein we differ in our accounts of holine&s;s will in &s;ome mea&s;ure appear from the foregoing inquiry.</NOTE> All tho&s;e, he &s;ays, are required, and nece&s;|&s;ary in order to render an action truly holy. And though the unregenerate do nothing from a holy principle, in a holy manner, and to a holy end; yet they may do THE MATTER OF DUTY; and in complying with this part of holine&s;s, they &s;o far obey the command requiring holine&s;s, and do their duty. As the whole di&s;pute now turns up|on <HI>the matter of duty,</HI> 'tis nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould well under|&s;tand what is meant by this, in order to judge on which &s;ide the truth lies.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y has u&s;ed this phra&s;e often enough, &amp; &s;aid a great deal about <HI>the matter of duty</HI>; but after all (under favour) I mu&s;t think he has not given a clear, con&s;i&s;tent account of it. He &s;ays it does not mean external actions, a&s;ide from the will producing them; but <HI>the effective acts of the will,</HI> choo&s;ing and producing external effects; that by the &s;ub&s;tance and matter of an action is meant THE ACTION <HI>as ab&s;tracted from all its circum&s;tances,</HI> and not any con&s;equent effects di&s;tinct from it.' P. 40. Matter of external duty, according to him, 'is the act of the will, <HI>ad extra,</HI> productive of an external work, required in the
<PB N="165" REF="012811_0173_0F8ABFD9CA0619E0">
divine law:' And this action is to be con&s;idered <HI>as ab|&s;tracted from all its circum&s;tances,</HI> viz. principle, motive, de&s;ign and end.</P>
<P>Upon this I would ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. There is in nature no &s;uch effective act of the will, nor can any &s;uch thing be conceived of, as 'tis &s;elf-con|tradictory. An act of choice, without any motive or de&s;ign, is ju&s;t as impo&s;&s;ible, as an act of choice without an act of choice. Therefore we may be &s;ure no &s;uch action is commanded, or done by the unregenerate or re|generate.</P>
<P N="2">2. If there could be any &s;uch actions, there would be no more duty or any thing of a moral nature in them, than there is in external conduct, con&s;idered as ab&s;tracted from all acts of choice, or <HI>in them&s;elves con&s;idered.</HI> An act of will, ab&s;tracted from all motive and de&s;ign, if any &s;uch thing could be, would have no more morality in it, than the wind or fire, producing effects, and would be no more prai&s;e-worthy or blamable. Mr. M. is confi|dent that no one 'ever dreamed that the mere motion of matter, &s;eparate from the agency of the mind, has any morality in it.' p. 40. We might with as much a&s;|&s;urance a&s;&s;ert that no man ever dreamed that the <HI>mere motion of the mind,</HI> &s;eparate from all motive, de&s;ign and end, has the lea&s;t morality in it, had he not furni&s;hed us with an in&s;tance. He is however, perhaps, the fir&s;t, and, I hope, will be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>But Mr. H&mdash;y comes out of the clouds before he has done, and appears &s;en&s;ible that matter of duty done with|out any motive and de&s;ign, good or bad, is neither duty nor &s;in; and grants that any action done with a bad end is 'materially evil,' that is, not the matter of duty, but the matter of &s;in. Therefore it was not the matter of duty; but 'vile treachery in Ju|das to ki&s;s his Lord, in order to betray him.' p. 91. If the matter of duty was the effective act of the will, ab|&s;tracted from all circum&s;tances; then Judas did the mat|ter
<PB N="166" REF="012811_0174_0F8ABFDAB0A1D058">
of duty, as much as any one can. But if his end and de&s;ign cannot be ab&s;tracted, but mu&s;t come into con&s;ide|ration to determine, whether he did the matter of duty or not; and his evil de&s;ign made it the matter of &s;in, then a man never does the matter of duty with an evil de|&s;ign, or from a wrong motive. So that the whole comes to this at la&s;t. There are certain effective acts of the will producing effects, <HI>ad extra,</HI> which are either good or evil, matter of duty, or matter of &s;in, according as the end of the agent is either good or bad. This is very a|greeable to common &s;en&s;e. When the beloved di&s;ciple John ki&s;&s;ed his dear Lord, as a &s;incere expre&s;&s;ion of love to him, it was a good action, the matter of duty. When Judas ki&s;&s;ed him with a traiterous de&s;ign, it was a vile action, and the matter of &s;in.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y being &s;en&s;ible of this, notwith&s;tanding all his di&s;tinctions about matter of duty, undertakes to &s;hew that the unregenerate may act from a good end; and re&s;ts his whole cau&s;e on this. He &s;ays, though they do not act from the highe&s;t and be&s;t ends, which men mu&s;t act from, in order to denominate their actions holy; yet they may act from &s;elf-love, which is not forbidden, but an in|nocent, u&s;eful and good principle. Therefore when they do things externally right, from this principle, and &s;eeking their own intere&s;t as their end, they &s;o far obey the divine command, and do their duty.</P>
<P>He does not expre&s;sly &s;ay, that I have ob&s;erved, that &s;elf-love is commanded, and &s;o a duty; but if it is not commanded, and &s;o a duty to act from this end, how can acting from &s;elf-love make an action a duty, or the matter of duty,&mdash;or what obedience is there in this? I do not find that he has told us.</P>
<P>He has <HI>&s;aid</HI> &s;elf-love is a natural, innocent &amp; good prin|ciple. But I do not find that he has offered any evidence of this; or that there is any thing to &s;upport it but his bare a&s;&s;ertion. This &s;urely ought not to be taken for granted; &s;ince he builds all his oppo&s;ition to me on this
<PB N="167" REF="012811_0175_0F8ABFDB4AC1FB88">
foundation. If &s;elf-love is not a good or innocent af|fection, but forbidden and &s;inful in every degree of it, all his building falls to the ground, and his <HI>matter of duty</HI> done by the unregenerate, turns out to be the matter of &s;in. This I have endeavoured to make evident in the preceed|ing inquiry; and I think I have a right to con&s;ider it as a full an&s;wer to the whole he has &s;aid in proof of the doctrines he has advanced, till it be &s;hewn that I have not given a right account of holine&s;s and &s;elf-love. I therefore refer him and the reader to that, hoping it may be the means of &s;uch light to him and all who attend to this controver&s;y, as &s;hall put an end to the di&s;pute. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. H&mdash;y's dividing and &s;plitting up holine&s;s into &s;o many parts, in order to find &s;omething belonging to it to be duty for the unrege|rate to do, has brought to mind the following &s;imilitude, which may &s;erve to illu&s;trate it. A certain debtor owed his creditor a thou&s;and dollars; but in&s;tead of paying him the real dollars, which he was able to do at any hour, had he been inclined, he brought to him an equal number of counterfeit dollars, and pleaded he had paid the debt, and an&s;wered his obligation, in part at lea&s;t; as there are &s;everal things in counterfeit dollars, which belong to true dollars, &s;uch as external appearance, &s;hape, &amp;c. though they want the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential thing, and are not true &s;ilver. And though he had no regard to his creditor and his intere&s;t, yet he acted from the <HI>innocent</HI> principle of &s;elf-love, as he did it in hopes that hereby he &s;hould e&s;cape being ca&s;t into pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y undertakes to confute a po&s;ition which he &s;ays I 'often lay down, and build much upon it, without once offering any thing in the &s;hape of an argument to prove it: ver. 12. <HI>That the unregenerate act wholly from &s;elf-love.</HI>' p. 60, &amp;c. It may be proper to take &s;ome notice of this. I grant the unregenerate have appetites and ta&s;tes which are not &s;elf-love, but quite di&s;tinct from it; &s;uch as animal ap|petites, hunger, thir&s;t, &amp;c. And &s;uch are a ta&s;te for natural beauty, and what is called natural affection, &amp;c. But the&s;e are not of a mo|ral kind; and therefore man's moral agency does not con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e; and if he had no other affections and principles of action, he would be no more a moral agent than the bea&s;ts. Therefore when we &s;peak of man's <HI>moral</HI> actions, it is not proper to &s;ay he acts merely from the&s;e appetites and in&s;tincts; but mu&s;t find &s;ome other principles of action. Mr. H&mdash;y &s;ays, p. 23. 'By moral actions I mean &s;uch as are com|manded or forbidden by the divine law.' But the&s;e in&s;tincts and ap|petites are neither commanded nor forbidden in the divine law. Therefore there is no moral agency in them, in them&s;elves con&s;idered. Though the&s;e may have influence in moral actions many ways; yet the morality of them does not con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e, but in univer&s;al bene|volence, or &s;elf love, one of which is implied in every moral action, and determines it. And in this the moral good or evil of every ac|tion wholly con&s;i&s;ts. For in&s;tance, if a man determines to gratify any particular bodily appetite, or not to do it, as a moral agent, he does this in the exerci&s;e of &s;elf-love, or univer&s;al benevolence; and therefore all his moral actions are determined by benevolence or &s;elf-love; a regard to others which includes a regard to him&s;elf, or that regard to him&s;elf only, which is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y gives a different account indeed, p. 61&mdash;64. He thinks becau&s;e 'men often, in their actions, follow the impul&s;e of particular in&s;tincts or appetites, in oppo&s;ition to their own intere&s;t on the whole; yea, in oppo&s;ition to what rea&s;on declares to be be&s;t or mo&s;t for their happine&s;s, taking in the whole of their duration,' it fol|lows that they not only do not act from &s;elf-love in &s;uch in&s;tances, but directly contrary to its dictates. The fallacy of his argument is ea&s;ily detected. Self-love never prompts men to that which is on the whole mo&s;t for their happine&s;s, but to the contrary; and therefore to choo&s;e and act contrary to the judgment, and determines men to do that which their rea&s;on dictates not to be for their greate&s;t happi|ne&s;s, the whole of their duration con&s;idered. Rea&s;on may dictate that the only way for a per&s;on to be truly happy is to be benevolent, and devoted to the greate&s;t good of the whole.' If any one &s;hould hence infer that &s;elf-love will influence &s;uch a per&s;on to &s;eek the ge|neral good in a di&s;intere&s;ted way; and that not to do this would be to act contrary to &s;elf-love, he would argue as well as Mr. H&mdash;y does. But I need &s;ay nothing to &s;hew the weakne&s;s and &s;elf contra|diction of &s;uch an argument. He is lead by his way of arguing to the following conclu&s;ion, p. 64.
<Q>The di&s;orders and mi&s;eries which abound in the world, through the wickedne&s;s of men, are perhaps chiefly owing to the inordinate &s;trength of particular appetites and inclinations, ungoverned by a regard to their own general good.</Q>
According to this, &s;elf-love is &s;o far from being &s;in, or tending to it, that the wickedne&s;s of men is chiefly owing to the want of &s;elf-love, or the weakne&s;s of it. And if this took place to a &s;ufficient degree, &s;o as to govern men, there would be very little wickedne&s;s among men, if any; even though they had no love to God or their neighbour! How different this account of &s;elf-love is from that given in the pre|ceding inquiry, &s;ect. iv. p. 19. &amp;c. every intelligent reader will &s;ee; and will judge for him&s;elf which if mo&s;t agreeable to &s;cripture, rea&s;on and experience.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y has attempted, by &s;everal arguments, to prove that the unregenerate have love to <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> di&s;tinct from &s;elf-love, which may in|fluence them to wi&s;h them well, do them good, &amp;c. He &s;ays, if the unre|generate act merely from &s;elf-love, then we are under no obligations of gratitude to them for any acts of kindne&s;s they may do us. 'But this is a con&s;equence not to be endured, which at one &s;troke cancels all obligations of gratitude to parents, friends and benefactors, for all fa|vours and kindne&s;&s;es, if they are unregenerate.' P. 66, 67.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. We are under obligations of gratitude to others for the kindne&s;s they &s;hew us, &s;o far as there is an <HI>appearance</HI> of kindne&s;s, which ought to affect us as &s;uch. Where there is an appearance of kindne&s;s, we ought to be affected with it as &s;uch, unle&s;s there be as great and &s;en&s;ible appearance of &s;omething to the contrary, or of no kindne&s;s intended, &s;ufficient to counterbalance it. And in &s;uch a ca&s;e there is, on the whole, no appearance of kindne&s;s. When an unrege|nerate man &s;hews us kindne&s;s, there is commonly a more &s;en&s;ible ap|pearance of kindne&s;s than of any thing to the contrary. The act of kindne&s;s is generally, if not always, more apparent and certain than his unregeneracy. And if we could be as certain he is unregene|rate; yet that this is the character of all the unregenerate; and there|fore this is really his character, and he has no real di&s;intere&s;ted good will to us; con&s;equently 'tis not really an act of kindne&s;s, however kind he may appear to be; we get the evidence of all this by a cour&s;e of rea&s;oning, and a number of deductions, which cannot affect our minds &s;o much, as the appearance of good will in the kindne&s;s &s;hewn; therefore the latter ought to preponderate in our minds, and affect us mo&s;t, produce &amp; feelings &amp; exerci&s;es an&s;werable. Therefore there is in &s;uch ca&s;es an obligation to gratitude. If Mr. H&mdash;y, or any other per&s;on, is not &s;atisfied with this &s;olution, let him account for our Saviour's weep|ing over Jeru&s;alem, in any other way; or the child's being grieved at the pain and trouble of his parent, while he verily believes it will all work for his good; and that he will be un&s;peakably more happy, on the whole, than he could be without it.</P>
<P>ANS. 2d. Let it be remembered, the unregenerate have no true gra|titude to benefactors. They are not plea&s;ed with di&s;intere&s;ted good will, for its own &s;ake. All their gratitude con&s;i&s;ts in &s;elf-love, and a con&s;equent love of tho&s;e who appear to love them. Whatever obli|gations they are under to gratitude for di&s;intere&s;ted kindne&s;s, they never fulfil them, nor are influenced by them, more than if they did not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>The regenerate or benevolent are thankful to God for all the bene|fits they receive by the hands of men: And if they have the mo&s;t clear and &s;en&s;ible evidence that the&s;e act wholly from &s;elf-love, they will love them, and do them all the good they can. In this view, the con|&s;equence Mr. H&mdash;y dreads, does not appear &s;o intolerable.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y further &s;ays, 'That love the unregenerate have &s;ome|times to others, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be educed from &s;elf-love. It is evident that the unregenerate have &s;ometimes &s;uch a love to others, as cau&s;es them to have a real plea&s;ure in and concern for their welfare, &s;eparate from all hopes, or pro&s;pects of being benefited by them,' which could not be if they loved others only for their own &s;akes, or wholly from &s;elf-love. He in&s;tances in one dying, and yet manife&s;ting concern for the welfare of his friends after he is dead, which can be of no be|nefit to him. P. 67, 68.</P>
<P>ANS. There is not the lea&s;t difficulty in accounting for this from &s;elf-love. Self-love will lead men to love others and wi&s;h them well, for the good <HI>they have done</HI> to them, as well as for the good they ex|pect they will do to them. Therefore this will influence a man to wi&s;h well to another who has been, and is now his friend, though, be|cau&s;e he is now going out of the world, he does not expect to receive any future benefit from him. Self-love does in a &s;en&s;e unite us to them who love us, and do us good; and leads us, by a nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, to look on them as belonging to us, and as part of our&s;elves. Hence there is a de&s;ire in &s;elfi&s;h men, which ari&s;es from &s;elf-love, to exi&s;t after they are dead, in their &s;urviving friend or relations, which they look upon in &s;ome &s;en&s;e as them&s;elves. And hence they are di&s;po|&s;ed to wi&s;h &amp; provide for their exi&s;tence &amp; comfort after they them|&s;elves &s;hall be dead, for the &s;ame rea&s;on they would do this for them|&s;elves, if they were to live, viz. from love to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y &s;ays, 'More arguments might be offered to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.' P. 70. If they are no more to the purpo&s;e than tho&s;e he has mentioned, 'tis to be hoped he will never be at the pains. How|ever, it is to be ob&s;erved, if he had proved that the unregenerate do not act wholly from &s;elf-love, it would an&s;wer no end in his di&s;pute with me; for he does not make u&s;e of this at all to prove his point, but, as has been ob&s;erved, does this wholly by &s;elf-love. Indeed he does not pretend that the love to others in the unregenerate, which he contends does not &s;pring from &s;elf-love, is more virtuous, or in any re|&s;pect better than &s;elf-love; and &s;ays 'it will not follow from any thing that has been pleaded for, that mankind have naturally a prin|ciple of true holine&s;s.' He will however, be put to difficulty to <HI>prove</HI> this, I believe. If di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence to our fellow-men is not of the nature of holine&s;s, and in its nature univer&s;al benevolence; and does not imply a friendly regard to God, and &s;upreme love to him, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to tell, I believe, what holine&s;s is. There|fore Mr. Edwards, to whom Mr. H&mdash;y had reference here, did, with good rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;e if it could be made evident that men naturally have di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence to others, it mu&s;t be granted they are naturally virtuous and holy. See his nature of true virtue, chap. iv. Mr. H&mdash;y adds, 'nor does it enervate the proofs of man's natural depravity from &s;cripture and experience.' This, with the whole of his &s;cheme, is doubtle&s;s incon&s;i&s;tent with man's <HI>total depravity,</HI> which the &s;cripture a&s;&s;erts; and in this view, is not only fal&s;e; but of a mo&s;t de&s;tructive tendency. The &s;cripture repre&s;ents the natural depravity of men, as rendering them <HI>hateful and hating one another,</HI> Tit. iii. 3. and &s;ays love and good will to others is of God; and none have this but they who are born of God. 1 Joh. iv. 7. Moreover, the &s;crip|ture &s;ays of men, in their natural &s;tate, 'they are <HI>altogether</HI> become unprofitable, there is none that doth good; no not one.' Rom. iii. 12. Their 'mind is enmity again&s;t God; is not &s;ubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be.' chap. viii. 7. 'That <HI>every</HI> ima|gination of the thoughts of their heart is <HI>only evil continually.</HI>' Gen. vi. 5.</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Remarks on Mr. Hemmenway's particular arguments to prove his point.</HEAD>
<P>OUR author attempts a particular proof of his po&s;iti|ons by <HI>nine</HI> arguments, which are &s;o enlarged as to take up above an hundred pages. I &s;hall not take notice of many particulars in the&s;e pages, which I think might

been particularly con&s;idered in the preceding &s;ection, and &s;hewn not to have any &s;ufficient &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="012811_0179_0F8ABFE285F11E40">His fir&s;t argument is expre&s;sly built wholly on this, p. 104&mdash;119. And is &s;ufficiently confuted by ob&s;erving the unregenerate do not the <HI>matter of duty,</HI> if &s;elf-love is not a good thing, but &s;in; and that &s;o far as men act from this, they act not for a good end, but a bad one, the op|po&s;ite to which he has not proved, but rather <HI>begged.</HI>&mdash; There is one pa&s;&s;age, however, in the&s;e pages which re|quires particular attention. P. 116, he &s;ays,
<Q>when he (meaning my&s;elf) &s;ays, that the unregenerate in attending the externals of religion, do nothing that is their duty, he con&s;iders the&s;e things as enjoined on men <HI>only on &s;up|po&s;ition that they are regenerate,</HI> and have a holy love to God: For he &s;ays, <HI>they are required only as expre&s;&s;ions of love to God.</HI></Q>
From this he draws <HI>four</HI> frightful con|&s;equences, and &s;ays,
<Q>I could ea&s;ily go on further, but I forbear. Methinks the&s;e con&s;equences are &s;o intolera|ble

that no principle ought to be admitted, from which they are fairly deduced. If they can fairly be avoided on Mr. H's plan, let it be &s;hewn.</Q>
p. 118.</P>
<P>ANS. This is all a mi&s;repre&s;entation. I do not &s;ay that the attending on the externals of religion, or any thing el&s;e, is enjoined on men, <HI>only on &s;uppo&s;ition they have a holy love to God.</HI> I &s;ay God requires all men to love him with all their hearts; which they do not, unle&s;s they expre&s;s it in all proper ways, in a proper attendance on the externals of religion. This command is ab&s;olute, without any &s;uppo&s;ition that they are regenerate, &amp;c. I &s;ay they who have no love to God really do no duty when they attend on the externals of religion. And if they cannot do this without a pretence and profe&s;&s;ion of doing duty, and of love to God; then his con&s;equences will follow. But till he &s;hall <HI>prove</HI> this, they can be as fairly avoided, and as &s;afely denied, on my plan, as on his own.</P>
<P>His <HI>&s;econd</HI> argument is taken from a pa&s;&s;age in Mark, parallel to that in Matt. where our Saviour gives a &s;um|mary of the divine law, from which I thought I had proved, that they who do not love God or their neighbours, do no duty. As what he &s;ays here, p. 119&mdash;132, is chiefly to obviate and confute the &s;en&s;e in which I under&s;tood the&s;e words of Chri&s;t, I &s;hall leave the particular con&s;ideration of this argument to another place. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would however ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that under this argument, he a&s;&s;erts, &amp; thinks he proves,
<Q>that an attendance or religious ordinances is en|joined on men <HI>by other commands</HI> than tho&s;e which enjoin holy love.</Q>
P. 121, 122, 123. This is a different and contrary &s;train from that in which he &s;ets out: For, in the beginning of his book, he is ready to allow there is no command that does not require holine&s;s; and &s;ays I have &s;tated the que&s;tion wrong in &s;aying it is, 'Whether there are any commands given to the unregenerate, <HI>which do not require any thing truly holy, but only</HI> require &s;uch exerci&s;es as have not the nature of true holine&s;s.' &s;ee p. 3, 4, 6. But he &s;eems to have forgotten all this now, and a&s;&s;erts the affirmative of this que&s;tion, and what is di|rectly contrary to what he had granted. For if there are '<HI>other com|mands</HI> than tho&s;e which enjoin holy love;' then there are commands which do not enjoin holine&s;s, or any thing truly holy: Since he grants there is nothing truly holy, where there is no holy love.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y's third argument is taken from Rom. ii.

14. 'For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, the&s;e hav|ing not the law, are a law unto them&s;elves.' Here the Gentiles, whom he concludes all will allow to be unre|generate, are expre&s;sly &s;aid to do the things contained in the law: Therefore the unregenerate may obey the law and do their duty in &s;ome in&s;tances.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. If the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of the heathen, the words taken in their connexion will prove that the hea|then by, nature, do tho&s;e things by which they &s;hall be ju&s;tified. This will &s;uit the gro&s;s Pelagians, and they have improved them to this purpo&s;e, as Mr. H&mdash;y ob|&s;erves; but this will prove too much for him, I con|clude. The apo&s;tle, in the ver&s;e immediately preceding, &s;ays <HI>the doers of the law</HI> &s;hall be ju&s;tified; and then the&s;e words came in. FOR when the Gentiles do the things contained in the law, that is, are <HI>doers of the law.</HI> It would be doing violence to the&s;e words to &s;uppo&s;e that doing the law, in the former clau&s;e means one thing, and doing the things of the law, in the next, which is connect|ed with the former by the illative particle <HI>for,</HI> means quite another thing. Therefore if the doers of the law &s;hall be ju&s;tified; and the heathen do the law, they &s;hall be ju&s;tified, and &s;aved, whether they are regenerate, or ever hear of Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, or not. Mr. H&mdash;y ar|gues that, &s;ince the &s;ame word is u&s;ed in each of the&s;e ver&s;es, it mu&s;t mean the &s;ame thing; and this, I think, is the mo&s;t weighty rea&s;on he gives again&s;t Mr. Gla&s;s's &s;en&s;e of the words. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gla&s;s ob&s;erves that the words in the original, rendered, <HI>do the things of the law,</HI> might more properly be rendered, <HI>do the offices of the law</HI>; i. e. their own con&s;ciences dictate to them what is right, and condemn or ju&s;tify, by which they are a law unto them&s;elves.</NOTE> He &s;ays 'It ought not to be &s;up|po&s;ed, without evident rea&s;on, that the apo&s;tle &s;hould immediately u&s;e the &s;ame word, in effect, to expre&s;s a meaning intirely diver&s;e.'

<P>ANS. 2. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed the apo&s;tle is here and in the preceding ver&s;es &s;peaking of that doing the things of the law, by which they who did them &s;hould live; and is explaining what he afterwards &s;ays is the tenor of law. Chap. x. 5. 'For Mo&s;es de&s;cribeth the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the law, that the man which doth tho&s;e things, &s;hall live by them.' That he &s;peaks of keeping the law in the &s;en&s;e in which the Jews generally under&s;tood it, as the way to life; and ob&s;erves that on this footing the Gentiles &s;tood as fair a chance for life as the Jews, if they were doers of the law, by a patient continuance in well doing. Yea, while &s;uch Gentiles were &s;aved, the Jew, who heard the law, and did not keep it, would certainly peri&s;h. That he &s;ays this only to convince the Jews of their error, without &s;uppo&s;ing that any one, Jew or Gen|tile, ever did or will do the things contained in the law, which if a man do, he &s;hall live in them. This &s;en&s;e is much preferable to that which repre&s;ents the heathen as actually doing tho&s;e things by which they &s;hall be &s;aved, without any knowledge of Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel. But there are objections again&s;t this &s;en&s;e, which I &s;tay not now to mention, but proceed to another, which to me is the mo&s;t natural and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>ANS. 3. The apo&s;tle is not here &s;peaking of uncon|verted heathens, but of &s;uch doing the things contained in the law as is implied in embracing the go&s;pel, or in the character of a chri&s;tian, which in the preceding con|text he calls a <HI>patient continuing in well doing</HI> and <HI>working good.</HI> And this is agreeable to our &s;aviour's account of the matter, Matt. vii. 21. and on. And St. James de|&s;cribes the true chri&s;tian in the &s;ame manner. Jam. i. 25. 'But who&s;o looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but <HI>a doer of the work,</HI> this man &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in his deed.'</P>
<P>The words following confirm this &s;en&s;e, in which the&s;e
<PB N="175" REF="012811_0183_0F8ABFEBD9C8D868">
Gentiles are &s;aid to &s;hew the work of the law <HI>written in their hearts</HI>; i. e. di&s;cover, by their prefe&s;&s;ion and conduct, the law written on their hearts. But this is &s;poken of as the character of God's people, as the effect of God's pow|er, and a ble&s;&s;ing peculiar to the covenant of grace, Jer. 31.33. Heb. 8.10.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration might, con&s;i&s;tent with the original, be rendered thus, 'For when the Gentiles, who by nature have not the law, do the things contained in the law.' The word tran&s;lated <HI>by nature</HI> being u&s;ed to denote their natural &s;tate, by birth and education, by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Jews, and not what they did by the force of mere nature. We have an expre&s;&s;i|on parallel to this in the 27 ver&s;e, where the &s;ame word is u&s;ed: 'And &s;hall not uncircumci&s;ion, <HI>which is by nature,</HI> if it fulfil the law &amp;c.' This phra&s;e means the &s;ame with that under con&s;ideration, 'the Gentiles who <HI>by na|ture</HI> are without law.' <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When St. Paul di&s;tingui&s;hes the Jews from the Gentiles, he u&s;es the &s;ame word. 'We who are Jews <HI>by nature.</HI>' Gal. ii. 15. In op|po&s;ition to this, the Gentiles were <HI>by nature</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Jews.</NOTE> And he is here evidently &s;peak|ing of the &s;ame thing; to <HI>fulfil the law</HI> is the &s;ame with doing the things contained in the law. And he goes on to &s;hew what this is, to the end of the chapter, viz. that it is nothing merely external, but belongs to the heart. But none will &s;uppo&s;e this character belongs to the un|converted Gentiles. He &s;peaks of the &s;ame Gentiles in the following parts of this epi&s;tle, 'Even us whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but al&s;o of the Gentiles. What &s;hall we &s;ay then? That the Gentiles which follow|ed not after righteou&s;ne&s;s, have attained to righteou&s;ne&s;s.' chap. ix. 24, 30, &s;ee al&s;o x. 12, &amp;c. xv. 18.</P>
<P>The Jews were greatly prejudiced again&s;t the Gentiles being received as the people of God, without being cir|cumci&s;ed, and becoming Jews by &s;ubmitting to their law in every particular. They &s;aid to the Gentiles, 'Except ye be circumci&s;ed, after the manner of Mo&s;es, ye cannot
<PB N="176" REF="012811_0184_0F8ABFEC98443820">
be &s;aved, that it was needful to circumci&s;e them, &amp; to com|mand them to keep the law of Mo&s;es.' Act. xv. 1, 5. The apo&s;tles them&s;elves had the &s;ame prejudices at fir&s;t. And when Peter came to under&s;tand the truth, he &s;aid, 'Of a truth, I perceive that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons: But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with him.

<P>It will perhaps be objected, that the la&s;t clau&s;e of the ver&s;e &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with the Gentiles here &s;poken of being chri&s;tians: 'The&s;e having not the law, are a law unto them&s;elves.' Gentile converts had the law as much as the Jews.</P>
<P>ANS. They had not the law in the &s;en&s;e in which the Jews had it. It was not given to them as it was to the Jews; nor in this &s;en&s;e binding on them. Therefore in the &s;en&s;e in which the Jew had the law, as a Jew, the Gentile had it not, but was without law, and continued &s;o, after he was converted to chri&s;tianity. And by volunta|rily improving the revelation of the moral law, made to the Jews, being approved by his own rea&s;on and con|&s;cience, for his own in&s;truction, conviction and practice, he was a law unto him&s;elf. This &s;en&s;e of the words has been mentioned by Augu&s;tin and others, as may be &s;een in <HI>Poli Syn. in loc.</HI> Though Mr. H&mdash;y thought not fit to take any notice of it. This &s;en&s;e is con&s;i&s;tent with the whole bible, and particularly with it's being &s;aid of all men by nature, chap. iii. ver&s;e 12. 'There is none that doth good, no not one,' which cannot be ea&s;ily reconciled with their doing <HI>by nature</HI> the things contained in the law; and being &s;uch <HI>doers of the law</HI> as &s;hall be ju&s;tified. Mr. H&mdash;y mu&s;t prove this cannot be the &s;en&s;e of the text, be|fore his argument from it will be of any &s;ervice to him.</P>
<P>His three next arguments, viz. from its being &s;aid of He|rod, that when he heard John, <HI>he did many things,</HI> Mark

vi. 20. From Paul's exhorting the chri&s;tians at Philippi to practi&s;e whatever things are true, hone&s;t, &amp;c. Phil. iv. 8. And 'from divers te&s;timonies from the Old Te&s;ta|ment, manife&s;ting God's <HI>approbation</HI> or favorable notice of the actions of un&s;anctified men, when for the &s;ub&s;tance conformable to his will,' are not &s;o different as to require a di&s;tinct an&s;wer to each of them.</P>
<P>The general an&s;wer is, Whatever men do from an evil principle, or for a forbidden end, is not duty in any &s;en&s;e; but &s;in. 'No man may do any acts of religious obedience for &s;uch ends as are &s;imply and ab&s;olutely unlawful. Such &s;acrifices are in a peculiar &s;en&s;e an abomination to the Lord.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hemmenway's &s;erm. p. 51.</NOTE> Mr. H&mdash;y grants the unregenerate act from no higher or better principle than &s;elf-love, and have no bet|ter end than this &s;ets up. But this is a &s;inful prin|ciple, and always pur&s;ues a wrong and bad end. Con|&s;equently &s;uch really do no duty. Therefore if he can|not prove that &s;elf-love is an innocent and good affection, there mu&s;t be &s;ome fallacy in all his arguments from the&s;e &s;criptures, or any others in favour of the unregenerate doing any part of their duty; e&s;pecially their doing that which is worthy of <HI>God's approbation and favourable notice.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;aid that Herod <HI>did many things</HI>; but not that he did any duty, or one thing, as John directed him to do it. John directed him to repent, and expre&s;s his repentance by acts of righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy; and if he had two coats, to give one to him that had none. Luk. iii. 8&mdash;14. If Herod gave a coat to the poor from &s;elf-love, he acted from no better principle or higher end than he did in depriving his brother of his wife, and or|dering John to be put to death. Selfi&s;hne&s;s and pride go|verned him in the former, as well as in the latter. He was the &s;ame man, acted from the &s;ame principle, and had the &s;ame end in view, in each of the&s;e actions.</P>
<P>His argument from Paul's directing Chri&s;tians to prac|ti&s;e what&s;oever things are true, &amp;c. is indeed &s;omewhat remarkable. He &s;ays, 'I have not cited it becau&s;e
<PB N="178" REF="012811_0186_0F8ABFEE112119F0">
&s;traitned for proofs.' P. 139. None will imagine he can be <HI>&s;traitned</HI> for proofs, who thinks this text to be one: Every command in the bible might be as 'pertinently ci|ted as this. Chri&s;t's command to his di&s;ciples, 'Ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de&s;pitefully u&s;e you,' is full as per|tinent; for the unregenerate can do this, &s;o far as it con|&s;i&s;ts in externals, as well as &s;peak the truth, and do what|&s;oever things are lovely. And indeed this implies what our Saviour enjoins; for a kind behaviour towards our enemies is one of the&s;e lovely things. But I believe Mr. H&mdash;y will not &s;ay that they who&s;e character is, <HI>hating one another,</HI> hating tho&s;e that hate them, do ever ble&s;s their enemies, according to the command of Chri&s;t. For when they ble&s;s with their mouth, their heart is full of cur&s;ing &amp; bitterne&s;s. And he in&s;i&s;ts, as has been ob&s;erved, that what|ever is done for a bad end, is not duty. Men may ble&s;s their enemies to gratify their ill will again&s;t them: But this is not doing the matter of duty, he grants. And they who ble&s;s them from no higher principle than &s;elf-love, always do it from ill will; for &s;elf-love is always and nece&s;&s;arily ill will to enemies. In a word, Mr. H&mdash;y's argument from this text takes its fair appearance wholly from a gingle of words; and a &s;uppo&s;ition that the unregenerate may &s;peak the truth not for a bad, but a good, end, which he has not yet proved.</P>
<P>The truth of the matter is plainly this. There are cer|tain external actions in words and conduct, which are the fruit of volition, or an expre&s;&s;ion of the heart, acting out in the&s;e ways. Such of the&s;e as are the proper expre&s;&s;ion of love to God and our neighbour, or univer&s;al benevo|lence, are put for the whole; the external &s;ign or effect, which alone is &s;een by men, is mentioned and &s;poken of as including the whole. Therefore the&s;e are mentioned in the command, and are commanded, as comprehending the whole. And when the&s;e effects are produced by men, they are &s;aid to do the things that were commanded, the
<PB N="179" REF="012811_0187_0F8ABFEEDEBB3000">
whole being implied, unle&s;s there be an expre&s;s exception. Therefore when only &s;omething external is mentioned in the command, and this is complied with and done, men are &s;aid to do as they are commanded in &s;cripture, and in common language among men, where none imagine that nothing is intended, but the exernal thing which is mentioned. This I take to be a full &s;olution of all the &s;eeming difficulty in all the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture Mr. H&mdash;y mentions, or that can be found, where only exter|nal actions are mentioned in the command, and men are &s;aid to do as they were commanded, when they did the external thing mentioned in the command. Mr. H&mdash;y &s;uppo&s;es the effective act of the will is implied, when only &s;omething external is mentioned; and we have as good authority to &s;ay the motives and de&s;ign of the agent are implied; for the&s;e are as e&s;&s;ential to every effective act of the will, as is this effective act, to the external effect; and more &s;o; for the external effect may take place where there is no act of the will, whereas there can be no effective act of the will without motive and de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The whole therefore comes to this: There are certain external things which are the proper expre&s;&s;ion of love to God and our neighbour, and by which the greate&s;t good of the whole is promoted. The&s;e are therefore com|manded. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Our author &s;ays, p. 48. 'The highe&s;t good of the univer&s;e is the original rea&s;on and foundation of the divine law.' This therefore mu&s;t be the de&s;ign of every particular command. And when any particular external action is commanded, it is &s;uppo&s;ed it mu&s;t be done with a de&s;ign to an&s;wer this end, which is the great end of all laws. And if the external action mentioned in the command is done with a contrary view and de&s;ign, there is no obedience to the com|mand, but it is nothing but di&s;obedience. But this is true of all who act wholly from &s;elf-love. No affection but univer&s;al benevolence agrees to the highe&s;t good of the univer&s;e. Self love does always ne|ce&s;&s;arily oppo&s;e it. Therefore he does not obey any command, who has no univer&s;al benevolence. See the preceding inquiry.</NOTE> And when the command is complied with, and the external thing is done with a right view and de|&s;ign, i. e. with a di&s;po&s;ition to promote the general good,
<PB N="180" REF="012811_0188_0F8ABFEF892EF7A8">
it is matter of duty: But if it be done with a bad de&s;ign, and from a contrary motive, viz. to &s;et up &s;elf in oppo&s;i|tion to the general good; it is not matter of duty, but matter of &s;in.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to what is &s;aid of God's manife&s;ting his approbation of the doings of wicked men, and taking a favourable notice of them, out of re&s;pect to what they did, in the ca&s;e of Ahab, Jehu, &amp;c. I &s;aid in my reply to Mr. Mills, God did not conduct in the&s;e in&s;tances, as a &s;earcher of hearts, but in what he &s;aid of them, and his conduct towards them, had re&s;pect to their pre&s;ent exter|nal appearance, profe&s;&s;ion and conduct, i. e. as if they really were what they profe&s;&s;ed to be, true penitents, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y demands 'direct and po&s;itive &s;cripture evi|dence of this hypothe&s;is;' and &s;ays, 'Of this, according to my be&s;t ob&s;ervation, his book affords nothing.' <HI>An&s;.</HI> I mentioned two pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, I&s;ai. lxiii. 8&mdash;10. P&s;alm. lxxviii. 36. which I thought amounted to a full proof of this. How this paragraph came to e&s;cape his ob&s;ervation I can't tell:&mdash;If he <HI>ob&s;erved it,</HI> and &s;aw it was not to the purpo&s;e, why was he not &s;o kind as to help our ignorance? He adds, 'Nor has he told us how it could properly be &s;aid of any one, without any re&s;pect to his heart, that his <HI>heart</HI> was or was not perfect, upright, &amp;c. when his behaviour was externally right.'</P>
<P>ANS. There is no &s;uch in&s;tance. It is &s;aid of Amazi|ah that he did that which was right; but not with a per|fect heart. 2 Chron. xxv. 2. But this has reference to what appeared in his external conduct. This was not al|together right, and this di&s;covered that his heart was not perfect. This would not have been &s;aid of him, if his be|haviour had been externally right.</P>
<P>I al&s;o &s;aid, if God granted favours to Ahab, Jehu, &amp;c. out of re&s;pect to their repentance and good deeds, and ma|nife&s;ted hereby his approbation of their doings, and took this favourable notice of what they did, and favoured
<PB N="181" REF="012811_0189_0F8ABFF0550AD358">
them becau&s;e they did &s;o well, while they were con&s;idered as having no connexion with Chri&s;t, and enemies to him; then he might be&s;tow the greate&s;t favours on men, out of re&s;pect to their own goodne&s;s; and con&s;equently they may be ju&s;tified by the deeds of the law; which over|throws the go&s;pel, and repre&s;ents Chri&s;t as dead in vain.</P>
<P>To this he &s;ays, in the fir&s;t place, God does in fact grint favours to men who are not believers in Chri&s;t, and therefore if my po&s;ition is true, he might grant the greate&s;t favours as well, even eternal &s;alvation, had there been no mediator;&mdash;&s;o that according to my way of arguing, a mediator was not nece&s;&s;ary, in order to the &s;alvation of men; &amp;c.</P>
<P>ANS. He has wholly overlooked the argument. I do not &s;ay 'tis incon&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel for God to grant favours to men, antecedent to their believing in Chri&s;t; but that 'tis incon&s;i&s;tent with the need of atone|ment for &s;in by Chri&s;t, if men, while unbelievers &amp; ene|mies to Chri&s;t and the atonement, <HI>may do tho&s;e works,</HI> by which they obtain God's approbation and favourable notice; for this implies pardon and acceptance, <HI>out of re&s;pect to their works,</HI> and <HI>purely for their works &s;ake</HI>; which is the &s;ame with being ju&s;tified by their works. If a man can be approved and accepted of God in his per&s;on and works, while he has no union to Chri&s;t or faith in him; then he is &s;o far accepted, and favoured, <HI>purely</HI> out of re&s;pect to his good deeds; and not in the lea&s;t out of re&s;pect to the righteou&s;ne&s;s and worthine&s;s of Chri&s;t. The nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's atonement is grounded in man's being in &s;uch a &s;tate by &s;in, that he cannot have God's approbation and favourable notice, on account of any thing he can do; even though he &s;hould become perfect|ly holy. If he could, Chri&s;t's atonement would be need|le&s;s. There is a wide difference between God's exerci|&s;ing benevolence to men; and his approving and accept|ing them and their doings, and taking a favourable no|tice
<PB N="182" REF="012811_0190_0F8ABFF1231DEDE0">
of them <HI>becau&s;e</HI> they have done &s;o well. The for|mer is exerci&s;ed towards men antecedent to their union to Chri&s;t; the latter cannot take place, unle&s;s they are actu|ally united to Chri&s;t, and intere&s;ted in his worthine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, which alone recommends men to the divine approbation and acceptance in their per&s;ons and works; for they are <HI>accepted in the beloved.</HI> Antecedent to their be|lieving in Chri&s;t, they are condemned and accur&s;ed, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with their having God's approbation, and his taking a favourable notice of their doings. It men could be thus delivered from the cur&s;e by their own do|ings and righteou&s;ne&s;s, there was no nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's being made a cur&s;e, to deliver them from it: Therefore, as to &s;uch, Chri&s;t is dead in vain. Gal. ii. 21. Mr. H&mdash;y has not &s;aid a word to &s;hew the defect of this argument, that I have ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>But he goes on to make another mi&s;take, and upon this &s;ays, the very &s;ame objections lie again&s;t the &s;en&s;e I put on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages. For if God treated them as if their conduct was right and acceptable to him, having re&s;pect only to their external conduct, without &s;earching their hearts, he did this, either on account of Chri&s;t's media|tion, or not. If not, then all the con&s;equences follow from this, which I have mentioned as following from his interpretation. If he in this has re&s;pect to Chri&s;t's me|diation, his doctrine is as vindicable, on this principle, as mine. He concludes thus,
<Q>Plainly then, when he will tell us how it can be reconciled with the divine pu|rity to &s;peak of, and conduct towards, &s;inners, not as the &s;earcher of hearts, but merely according to their vi&s;ible behaviour; and clear his own hypothe&s;is from the con&s;equences he draws from the doctrine he oppo|&s;es; then I &s;uppo&s;e a man of his di&s;cernment, or even half an eye, will ea&s;ily &s;ee that the doctrine he oppo&s;es may in the &s;ame way be as well vindicated.</Q>
P. 155.</P>
<P>ANS. God, in treating them, not as the &s;earcher of hearts, but according to their vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ion and con|duct,
<PB N="183" REF="012811_0191_0F8ABFF1D6CA4A20">
had re&s;pect to them, and expre&s;&s;ed his approbation of them, con&s;idered as intere&s;ted in the atonement, or as his &s;ervants truly devoted to him; which was true, if their hearts were an&s;werable to their external appearance. Since he really accepts and approves of all true penitents, purely for Chri&s;t's &s;ake; he vi&s;ibly approved of them who were vi&s;ibly penitents, and devoted to him, or appeared to be intere&s;ted in the atonement.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y has got to &s;hew, it will follow from hence, that God may as well manife&s;t his approbation of men's characters and doings, con&s;idered as impenitents, and not united to Chri&s;t. At pre&s;ent I believe he who has not &s;o much as <HI>half an eye</HI> is mo&s;t likely to attempt it.&mdash;While we treat men according to their vi&s;ible appearance, we are obliged to take a favourable notice of and love him who profe&s;&s;es &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, purely for his &s;ake, without knowing his heart, but treating him as if it was an&s;werable to his profe&s;&s;ion. If any one &s;hould hence in|fer, that we may, with as great propriety, manife&s;t the &s;ame approbation and love to tho&s;e who are vi&s;ibly unbe|lievers, and bear no particular relation to Chri&s;t, he would argue as Mr. H&mdash;y does, if he under&s;tands my argument. The way is now prepared to &s;ee with how much propri|ety he introduces the following words:
<Q>Methinks it is &s;omewhat odd, fir&s;t to deny and di&s;pute again&s;t <HI>the fact,</HI> viz. <HI>That God expre&s;&s;es his approbation of &s;ome actions of &s;inners, and grants temporal rewards to them becau&s;e of &s;uch actions,</HI> and then immediately &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame fact, and introduce a &s;cheme to account for it, or &s;hew it to be con&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfections, and the truth of the go&s;pel.</Q>
I at pre&s;ent think it <HI>&s;omewhat more than odd</HI> that a gentleman of his abilities &s;hould be &s;o much in the dark in &s;o plain a ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h this head by ob&s;erving, that in the pa&s;&s;ages under con&s;ideration, and others of the like kind, there is as much evidence from the expre&s;&s;ions them&s;elves, that they did the whole of their duty, as that they really did
<PB N="184" REF="012811_0192_0F8ABFF2ABBE5D40">
any part of it. And Mr. H&mdash;y is very arbitrary, having nothing in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions or any where el&s;e to warrant him, in a&s;&s;erting the meaning is, they did <HI>the matter of duty.</HI> Yea we are as certain they did not the matter of duty, as he explains it, as that they did not the whole of their duty, when they are &s;aid to do as the Lord com|manded; for in order to this, according to him, they mu&s;t do it in a &s;erious, con&s;cientious manner, with a regard to their duty, and under the influence of the &s;pirit of God; and for ends that are innocent and good. But we have no more rea&s;on to think that all the I&s;raelites, or the big|ger part, had all this, than that they were all holy. But we are &s;ure they did right, and as the Lord commanded, in appearance, and &s;o far as their external conduct is con|cerned. Why then &s;hould we not be content with the plain, obvious &s;en&s;e, though this be con&s;i&s;tent with their really doing no duty; but, as their act, may be an act of rebellion?</P>
<P>His &s;eventh argument is taken from &s;innners having <HI>encouragement to attend on means</HI> in order to their &s;alvati|on. He &s;ays it hence follows that this is their duty; for 'God never encouraged any one to do that which was not his duty.' P. 157&mdash;165.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. It has been &s;hewn that the unregenerate do no duty, according to his own account, if &s;elf-love is not an innocent and good thing, but is &s;in, and &s;o far as men act for the end <HI>that</HI> propo&s;es, they act wrong. But this we &s;hall conclude to be true, till &s;ome evidence that 'tis not &s;o be produced. Therefore till he has done this, his own &s;cheme mu&s;t be con&s;idered as involved in all the dif|ficulties he thinks he finds in mine. He &s;ays, 'No one mu&s;t be encouraged to perform duties for &s;uch ends as ought not to be propo&s;ed, or cannot be attained.' Serm. p. 39. But they who act from &s;elf-love only, always act for &s;uch ends: Therefore ought not to act from &s;elf-love. He al&s;o &s;ays, 'God's de&s;ign in giving the&s;e commands (i. e. commands to the unregenerate) <HI>are indeed different
<PB N="185" REF="012811_0193_0F8ABFF35B9EFBE0">
from theirs</HI> in obeying them;' and repre&s;ents every uncon|verted man 'held by Satan, <HI>under his dominion,</HI>' and 'walking upon enchanted ground.' Ibid. p. 63. Con&s;e|quently they act for ends which ought not to be propo&s;ed,' and cannot be obtained, according to his own account. To what then are they to be encouraged? What duty do they do, while acting from tho&s;e ends, which ought not to be propo&s;ed, by which they are held under the dominion of Satan, and walk upon enchanted ground? If we &s;trip their actions of all ends, and con&s;ider them as doing duty without motive and de&s;ign, as he &s;ometimes &s;eems to af|fect to do, we &s;trip them of every thing that is either du|ty or &s;in, as has been ob&s;erved; and that only remains, to which there can be no encouragement; for to talk of encouraging men to do that which involves no motive and de&s;ign, is a contradiction. When Mr. H&mdash;y will make his own &s;cheme con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and with his doctrine of encouragement, I tru&s;t all the difficulties he has attempted to fa&s;ten on mine, will be ea&s;ily re|moved.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. If it appears from &s;cripture hi&s;tory, and ex|perience, that they are mo&s;t likely to come to the know|ledge of the truth and be &s;aved, with whom mo&s;t means are u&s;ed, and who are mo&s;t engaged to attend, in a &s;en&s;e of their undone, mi&s;erable ca&s;e; and have the cleare&s;t conviction of their true &s;tate, &amp;c. Then this is a motive and encouragement to men to attend on the&s;e means, &s;o far as future mi&s;ery is an evil, and eternal happine&s;s is a good in their view, whatever may be their ends in other re&s;pects. And if this is all that is meant by encourage|ment to attend on means, may not a man take this encouragement and act upon it, without doing any duty? The encouragement in this ca&s;e does not turn upon the ends he has in view, or the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of his ex|erci&s;es and conduct; but upon this plain fact, that per|&s;ons in &s;uch a &s;ituation are more likely to be &s;aved, than
<PB N="186" REF="012811_0194_0F8ABFF4089A6C50">
tho&s;e in another. One takes the encouragement, and is induced to attend, from bad motives, and for a wrong end; and does nothing but &s;in; another is influenced by this fact from the be&s;t motives, and does his duty; yet it is encouragement to both of them. It is certain, from ex|perience, this fact affords encouragement to the &s;inner, who dreads damnation, to attend, though he is con&s;cious he attends as a rebel, with a heart wholly oppo&s;ed to God and all his commands: And will it follow that God en|courages him in his rebellion!</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y &s;ays,
<Q>It will be impo&s;&s;ible to convince tho&s;e, who view things in any mea&s;ure as they are, that &s;uch a conduct as is not their duty, has any probable tendency to promote their final intere&s;t.</Q>
P. 172. It is granted, &s;uch conduct has no tendency in it&s;elf to pro|mote their &s;alvation. The ground of hope, in this ca&s;e, is entirely in what God does, many times over-ruling it &s;o as to i&s;&s;ue in their &s;alvation. It is impo&s;&s;ible for Mr. H&mdash;y to prove that a per&s;on, &s;en&s;ible that he does no du|ty, whether he attends on means or not, may not be in|duced to attend, as the only hopeful way of e&s;caping the evil he dreads; for this is not only contrary to rea&s;on, but to many known facts. Many who are convinced they do no duty, but that all the exerci&s;es of their hearts are a con&s;tant &s;eries of horrid rebellion again&s;t God, are engaged to attend on means as the mo&s;t likely way to e|&s;cape the damnation they dread. And it appears from fact, that the more fully a &s;inner is convinced that his heart con&s;tantly oppo&s;es God, and the more he feels the mi&s;ery of his ca&s;e, the more engaged he will be in attend|ing on means. And if &s;uch could be made to believe that there was no hope for them, but in the way of doing duty, they would &s;it down in ab&s;olute de&s;pair.</P>

<P>ANS. 1. Though God's ends are an&s;wered by his com|mands, and the &s;inners attendance on means; and it is &s;ometimes made the occa&s;ion of good to him; yet it does not follow that the &s;inner does any duty. He &s;ays the &s;inner is under the dominion of Satan in all he does, and his ends are different from God's in his in&s;titutions and commands. The &s;inner's exerci&s;es and exertions have no tendency, in them&s;elves, to an&s;wer any good end. They are all evil, and tend to evil, being oppo&s;ition to the divine authority and command. When they i&s;&s;ue in &s;aving good to the &s;inner, 'tis wholly owing to the interpo&s;ing, over-ruling hand of God. The &s;inner in all his exertions under awakenings and convictions of con&s;cience, while <HI>under the dominion of Satan,</HI> is more like a wild bull in a net, than a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, obedient child; and would get out of the hands of God, if he could, and all his &s;trivings are really &s;trivings again&s;t God, as they are utterly oppo&s;ed to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him; like the exertions of a wild bea&s;t, untamed, un&s;ubdued, in the hands of him who is taking methods to bring him to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. God u&s;es means with the &s;inner, &s;uited to bring him to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and is plea&s;ed to cau&s;e them to be &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;ome in&s;tances; but till the &s;inner &s;ubmits he does not comply with God's de&s;ign, but acts like a rebel in all his exertions. This is the &s;cripture account of the matter. 'The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God. Every one that doth evil <HI>hateth the light.</HI>' Joh. iii. 20. 'He that is not with me, is a|gain&s;t me; and he that gathereth not with me, &s;cattereth abroad.'

But &s;ure|ly the &s;cripture will not warrant him to apply the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions to the doings of the unregenerate. They only tend to blind and deceive.

<P><PB N="188" REF="012811_0196_0F8ABFF83941BAE8">ANS. 2. It is granted that God's in&s;titutions and commands, have a tendency to influence the unregenerate; and are de&s;igned and u&s;ed to promote what is called a preparatory work in them; but it does not follow that they, while unregenerate, obey any of the&s;e injunctions &amp; commands. Our author &s;ays,
<Q>The hearers of the go&s;|pel are to be immediately called to believe and repent; and the&s;e commands and exhortations are to be en|forced with a promi&s;e of pardon and &s;alvation, if they comply; and a threatening of damnation if they remain impenitent.</Q>
P. 191. And he adds,
<Q>The inculcation of it, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, is a means of good to &s;in|ners. The work of conviction and humiliation may, through the influence of the holy &s;pirit, be promoted in them. Hereby they are led into a ju&s;t view of the mi&s;ery and danger of a &s;tate of &s;in; and are excited earne&s;tly to implore the mercy of God;&mdash;and diligent|ly to attend on all the appointed means of conver&s;ion.</Q>
&mdash;If this is the tendency of inculcating the&s;e commands, what need is there of preaching up any other duty &s;hort of repentance, to promote a work of conviction, &amp;c. and lead &s;inners diligently to attend on means? This will an|&s;wer all the&s;e ends to all intents as well; and, I mu&s;t add, much better than preaching up duties to be done by them while in a &s;tate of enmity with God; for this has no tendency to convince the &s;inner of his true &s;tate, of his &s;in, mi&s;ery and danger, or thoroughly to awaken him to an engagedne&s;s in this matter; but the contrary. I appeal to fact and experience. What per&s;ons have appeared to have the mo&s;t ju&s;t view of their mi&s;ery and danger; and to be mo&s;t in earne&s;t in attendance on means? Are they not &s;uch as have been convinced that they are wholly re|bels; that they are &s;o far from doing any duty, that all they do is &s;in; and their hearts con&s;tantly ri&s;e in rebelli|on
<PB N="189" REF="012811_0197_0F8ABFFA658FC8A0">
again&s;t God? When &s;inners come to this conviction, you cannot per&s;wade them that they do any duty, or keep them from a con&s;tant attendance on means. And where the&s;e doctrines are preached, and &s;inners are called upon to repent, &amp;c. and taught that they do no duty, while they refu&s;e this, they are as much di&s;po&s;ed to be in the u&s;e of means, as <HI>they,</HI> at lea&s;t, who have the contrary doctrine preached to them.</P>
<P>But what is mo&s;t to the purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve here is, that Mr. H&mdash;y has, in this conce&s;&s;ion, given up the whole of this argument. His argument is, that becau&s;e the divine commands and in&s;titutions are de&s;igned to an&s;wer ends, with re&s;pect to the unregenerate, to promote a preparato|ry work, &amp;c. therefore they mu&s;t enjoin duty to be done by them while unregenerate. But he here &s;ays, all the&s;e ends may be an&s;wered by calling on them to repent and believe immediately, on pain of damnation. And by this has &s;apped the whole foundation of his own argument.</P>
<P>ANS. 3. Mr. H&mdash;y allows they do no duty, and have not 'a next power' to do any of the duties he pleads for, who have not 'the inward influence of the &s;pirit of God.' P. 50, and in many other places. But the in&s;titutions and commands of God re&s;pect the&s;e, as well as tho&s;e who have the inward influence of the &s;pirit, and are de&s;igned to an&s;wer ends with re&s;pect to them; and &s;uch attend|ance on means, as they are capable of, may, &amp; does &s;ome|times, an&s;wer the&s;e ends, and proves the means of their awakening and &s;alvation. Therefore &s;uch obedience is enjoined in and by go&s;pel in&s;titutions. This argument is built on the &s;ame ground on which his &s;tands: But he will not allow it to be good: Con&s;equently mu&s;t allow us, and ought him&s;elf, to have as poor an opinion of his own.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething to be done with a &s;inner, antece|dent to his receiving 'the inward influences of the &s;pirit of God,' and as a means of it; and he may do &s;omething, viz. read the bible, and hear the go&s;pel preached. And
<PB N="190" REF="012811_0198_0F8ABFFAC867CB60">
why is not this as much duty, as any thing the &s;inner does, who has the inward influences of the &s;pirit, according to his argument? Therefore it proves too much, even what he &s;ays is not true; and &s;o proves nothing at all.</P>
<P>He probably made this di&s;tinction, and expre&s;sly ex|cluded all who have not the inward influences of the &s;pi|rit from doing any duty, becau&s;e it would be not a little &s;hocking to repre&s;ent the openly profane per&s;on as doing the matter of duty, when he puts on a &s;erious face for an hour in hearing a &s;ermon, while his heart is as much giv|en to profanene&s;s as ever, and his de&s;ign is to improve what he hears to the vile&s;t purpo&s;es. But they who judge not <HI>according to the appearance, but righteous judgment,</HI> according to the &s;tandard of truth, and look on every unregenerate heart full of nothing but thoughts and ima|ginations, which are wholly evil continually; of cur&s;ing and bitterne&s;s; of enmity again&s;t God; <HI>deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked</HI>; will be as far from ad|mitting that &s;uch do any duty, as he is that any duty is done by the &s;ecure and profane. And though he may think it very uncharitable, I am confident that if he had con&s;tantly viewed the unregenerate in this &s;criptural light, his two books wrote to prove and inculcate unrege|nerate duties, never would have exi&s;ted. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that he often forgets this di&s;tinction, as well he might, &s;ince 'tis &s;o arbitrary, and repre&s;ents tho&s;e as do|ing duty, who can have no pretence to the &s;pirit of God, more than all men on earth, even the whole ho&s;t of I&s;rael, and the mixed multitude at the red &s;ea, and in the wilder|ne&s;s; though he &s;ays, God, at the &s;ame time, 'knew that they were a rebellious generation.' P. 174. And he &s;ays the multitude of the Jews did their duty in &s;itting down to eat, though they were a &s;tupid, carnal generation, and followed Chri&s;t, only for the loaves. And his de&s;cription of the matter of duty in many places is &s;uited to the doings of the mo&s;t profligate wretch in the king|dom,
<PB N="191" REF="012811_0199_0F8AC000CFFF2760">
though at other times, in contradiction to him&s;elf, he expre&s;sly excludes &s;uch from doing any duty.</P>
<P>This leads me to ob&s;erve, he &s;ays, when Chri&s;t directed the Jews to &s;earch the &s;criptures, he mu&s;t mean a &s;tudy of the &s;criptures by the unregenerate, in order to conver|&s;ion, or their receiving the holy &s;pirit in his &s;anctifying influences, becau&s;e they were then unregenerate. But up|on the &s;ame ground I may &s;ay, he means a &s;earch of the &s;criptures, which men may practice before they have 'the inward influences of the &s;pirit of God,' for the&s;e Jews had not the &s;pirit in this &s;en&s;e; and mu&s;t they wait and do nothing till the &s;pirit came upon them? Was it not their duty to &s;earch the &s;criptures, in order to obtain the influ|ences of the &s;pirit? And did Chri&s;t direct them to &s;tudy the &s;criptures, only on &s;uppo&s;ition they had the &s;pirit. If he directed them to that &s;earch of the &s;criptures, which they could not perform till they had <HI>the inward influences of the &s;pirit,</HI> which they were then wholly without; why might he not as well mean &s;uch a &s;tudy of them, as im|plied the holy &s;pirit in his &s;anctifying influences? Was not the latter as much in their reach as the former? And are not God's in&s;titutions and commands as much calcu|lated and de&s;igned to bring men to the former, as to the latter? When he will &s;olve the&s;e difficulties, and an|&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions, on his own principles, we may &s;afe|ly promi&s;e a full an&s;wer to all he &s;ays on this head, from this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, or any other. This, we tru&s;t, has been made already. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. H&mdash;y frequently repre&s;ents that, upon our plan, the unrege|nerate are not to be exhorted to do any duty, but only <HI>on &s;uppo&s;ition they are regenerated</HI>; and that nothing is their duty in pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances. In this view, he &s;ays, p. 171. 'Why do any &s;eek to per&s;wade unregenerate &s;inners that the&s;e things are not their duty?' This is a groundle&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation. While we tell them they do no duty &s;o long as they are impenitent, we have duty enough to urge upon them, and that without making any &s;uppo&s;ition; and which he him|&s;elf grants is their <HI>immediate</HI> duty.</P>
<P>But if this repre&s;entation were ju&s;t, it might be equally applied to him, and it might be &s;aid, he find no duty for them to do, who have not received the inward influences of the &s;pirit; and they cannot be exhorted to any, only on &s;uppo&s;ition they have the&s;e influences How they &s;hall know when they have the&s;e influences, he has not told, and perhaps if he &s;hould try, he would find it much ea&s;ier to tell, from the bible, how per&s;ons may know whether they have the &s;pirit in his &s;av|ing influences, than that they have his influences, which are &s;hort of it.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="012811_0200_0F8C692EC4D45FB8">Mr. H&mdash;y makes great u&s;e of imperfect holine&s;s being pre&s;cribed as the means of &s;alvation; and &s;eems to think this quite &s;ufficient to prove his point, and &s;top the mouth of mo&s;t objections again&s;t him. His argument &s;eems to be this: If the be&s;t of men are imperfect, and do but part of their duty in this world; and true repentance and faith, however imperfect, are the appointed means of eter|nal life; then the doings of the unregenerate are appoint|ed duties, as means of their conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. Real holine&s;s is duty; and he who exerci&s;eth this, though in an imperfect degree, &s;o far does his duty, and no further.

<P>ANS. 2. They are required to be perfect in all things; nor is imperfect holine&s;s pre&s;cribed by any command. It is, thro' the grace of the go&s;pel, made a means of &s;alva|tion, and intere&s;ts in all the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace; but every injunction and command requires per|fect holine&s;s, as much as any degree of it. The lowe&s;t degree of holine&s;s is in &s;ome degree obedience to the com|mand, though 'tis not required as thus imperfect; and di|vine grace pardons the imperfection and &s;in for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, to whom the lowe&s;t degree of true faith in him unites the believer. But &s;till, how does it follow from this, that what has no degree of holine&s;s is any part of duty, or pre|&s;cribed as a means of conver&s;ion?</P>
<P>Under this argument he undertakes to correct '<HI>a no|table mi&s;take,</HI>' which, he &s;ays, I have made, in repre&s;ent|ing that &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, and argue from it, as an undenia|ble

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See reply to Mr. Mills, p. 133.</NOTE> He &s;ays, he knows of none to whom this is applicable.

P. 183, marg. 189, &amp;c.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. I own that when I wrote what he refers to, I did &s;uppo&s;e he had taken this for an undoubted maxim in &s;ome things he &s;aid in his &s;ermons, as well as others in their writings: And I was not alone in this. I was led to this conclu&s;ion from his building an argument, for the duties he was pleading for, wholly on this &s;uppo&s;ition, as I thought. P. 130, &amp;c. he undertakes to prove that the things which the unregenerate may do, while &s;uch, are required of them. And he does this principally by citing a number of &s;criptures, in which there are commands to <HI>hear, &s;earch the &s;criptures, pray,</HI> &amp;c. And all he &s;ays to prove the&s;e &s;criptures are to his purpo&s;e, and require the doings of the unregenerate, is to ob&s;erve <HI>they were &s;poken to &s;uch.</HI> Now, if it is not true that nothing but the do|ings of the unregenerate, or what they may do, while &s;uch, is required of them; then the&s;e commands, given to the unregenerate, may require not what they do, while &s;uch, but what the regenerate only do; &s;o his argument comes to nothing. If I &s;hould undertake to prove, from &s;cripture, that a profane drunkard was required to pray, while in the mid&s;t of his profanene&s;s and cups; and in or|der to this &s;hould produce a &s;cripture requiring prayer, and only ob&s;erve this &s;cripture was addre&s;&s;ed to profane drunkards; would not every one &s;ee I had not proved my point, unle&s;s it was certain that nothing is in &s;cripture required of &s;uch men, but what they may do while &s;uch?
<PB N="194" REF="012811_0202_0F8ABE7A4E814D78">
And would they not have right to conclude I built on this as an undeniable maxim?</P>
<P>I knew Mr. H&mdash;y offered other arguments, and &s;aid many things incon&s;i&s;tent with what I &s;uppo&s;ed he took for granted here, as the foundation of his argument; yet this was no evidence that he did not here build wholly on the maxim mentioned: Nor am I able yet to make any thing of his argument on any other &s;uppo&s;ition. But &s;ince he &s;ays this was not his meaning, it mu&s;t be left to the public to judge, who has made the greate&s;t mi&s;take, he, in writing as he has done, or I, in under&s;tanding him as I did.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. Though he has undertaken now to '&s;tate the matter <HI>plainly,</HI> as he under&s;tands it;' I confe&s;s it is not <HI>very plain</HI> to me, though it may be to others. P. 190, &amp;c. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. His argument, as he now &s;tates it, proves nothing. The argument is this, if I <HI>now</HI> under&s;tand him. There are certain in&s;trumental duties to be done by the unre|generate, and means to be attended upon, in order to con|ver&s;ion. Therefore the &s;criptures commanding the&s;e things, as what they have <HI>a next power to do,</HI> bind the&s;e duties upon them. Here the whole thing to be proved is &s;till taken for granted, viz. that there are <HI>in&s;tru|mental duties</HI> for the unregenerate to do.</P>
<P N="2">2. If his argument proves any thing, it proves too much for him&s;elf. If commands to the unregenerate re|&s;pect all they may do, while &s;uch, in attendance on means, &amp;c. and make all this their duty, as they may do it; then they, who have not 'the inward influences of the &s;pirit,' are hereby bound to duty, which they may do, while in this &s;tate, and the argument is as &s;trong for the&s;e duties as any other. But he him&s;elf grants &s;uch do no duty. If his way of arguing does not prove they do, it proves nothing.</P>
<P N="3">3. He, in explaining his argument, gives it all up, as has been ob&s;erved, p. 188, 189. For if, as he a&s;&s;erts,
<PB N="195" REF="012811_0203_0F8ABF7B474C7C08">
commands which the unregenerate never obey, while &s;uch, are &s;uited to excute them to all tho&s;e exertions and attendance on means, and produce all tho&s;e effects, nece&s;&s;ary to take place in order to conver&s;ion, and always do this, where they take effect; then the nece&s;&s;ity of their attending on means, &amp;c. does not infer any command of the&s;e things, as they do them; for there is no need of any &s;uch command, in order to their doing them.</P>
<P N="4">4. He has, I think, in &s;tating this matter <HI>plainly,</HI> &s;aid other things <HI>plainly</HI> incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves. He &s;ays repeatedly, it is the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> the <HI>immediate</HI> duty of the unregenerate to repent and believe the go&s;pel, &amp;c. And yet, in the mid&s;t of all this, he a&s;&s;erts
<Q>God has not enjoined on any the impracticable ta&s;k of exerci&s;ing &s;u|pernatural powers or principles, before they are fur|ni&s;hed with them, as the means of obtaining any ble&s;&s;|ings temporal or &s;piritual. To pre&s;cribe impo&s;&s;ible means would be the &s;ame thing as to pre&s;cribe none. Faith and repentance are means of &s;alvation only to tho&s;e who are enabled to believe and repent.</Q>
P. 191. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Agreeable to this, he in his &s;ermons quotes with approbation the following &s;entence.
<Q>God does not command impo&s;&s;ibilities; but in commanding, directs &s;inners to <HI>do what they can,</HI> and to &s;eek and endeavour to do what they cannot.</Q>
P. 199. marg. i. e. God does not command the unregenerate to do any thing, which they cannot do while &s;uch.</NOTE></P>
<P>Perhaps I have made another <HI>notable mi&s;take</HI> for Mr. H&mdash;y to correct: But if I have not, the&s;e are not only incon&s;i&s;tencies, but he has here a&s;&s;erted the very doctrine I had &s;aid &s;ome hold, and was implied in the argument abovementioned; which he repre&s;ents to be a notable mi&s;take. For according to this, God does not enjoin any thing on the unregenerate in order to their &s;alvation, which they may not do while unregene|rate. Upon this ground his argument, from the &s;criptures above mentioned, &s;tands good; and we may be &s;ure that whatever the &s;cripture directs &s;inners to, in order to &s;alva|tion, it is &s;omething they may do while unregenerate.
<PB N="196" REF="012811_0204_0F8ABF7C1A8AA5B0">
And I am yet peru&s;aded he in his own mind built on this as an undeniable maxim, when he wrote his &s;ermons, though he may now think he did not. His argument is conclu&s;ive, on this &s;uppo&s;ition: And why &s;hould he not &s;uppo&s;e then, what he has a&s;&s;erted now; and that even while he is declaring he holds no &s;uch thing?</P>
<P N="4">4. He here a&s;&s;erts a certain connexion between what the unregenerate may do, and &s;alvation; which he had repeatedly &s;aid, we have no warrant to a&s;&s;ert from &s;crip|ture, and has declared his belief of the contrary. His words are,
<Q>God's denying &s;pecial and effectual grace to tho&s;e who are favoured with the outward means, is a penal con&s;equence of their neglecting to do what they had a next power to do in a way or attendance on means.</Q>
P. 193. If &s;o, then none peri&s;h who attend on the means as the unregenerate may do. But how does he know this, unle&s;s he finds it a&s;&s;erted in the bible? But if it is a&s;&s;erted there, it is the &s;ame with a divine promi&s;e of &s;alvation to all who thus attend the means. How then can he &s;ay, as he does repeatedly, it cannot be proved there are any promi&s;es of &s;alvation to the doings of the unrege|nerate? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. H&mdash;y, in his &s;ermons, &s;ays, 'I do not plead for a promi&s;e of regeneration to the endeavours of the unconverted.'

And to this purpo&s;e ap|plies the words of Chri&s;t, 'Who&s;oever hath (i. e. holds or improves what he hath) to him &s;hall be given.' This is an ab&s;olute promi&s;e to that improvement here intended. Therefore if it intends what the unregenerate do, there are promi&s;es to the doings of the unregenerate. Moreover, he applies one of the mo&s;t expre&s;s promi&s;es in the bible to the unregenerate. Matth. vii. 7&mdash;10. See p. 106, 107, 108. How the&s;e things can be made con&s;i&s;tent, I know not.</NOTE></P>
<P>He concludes by &s;aying, 'The&s;e ob&s;ervations, it is hoped, may help Mr. H. to under&s;tand the principles on which our argument proceeds, better than he appears to have done.'

<P><PB N="197" REF="012811_0205_0F8ABF7CC8B33028">His la&s;t argument is this: 'The hearers of the go&s;|pel are commanded to repent and be converted that they may be &s;aved; and this infers an obligation on all to at|tend the means of conver&s;ion.

But the doings of the impenitent are impenitent doings, and wholly oppo&s;ed to repentance and conver&s;ion: There|fore are not implied in the command to repent, &amp;c. &s;o far from this, that they are altogether di&s;obedience to the command. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">This is, I think, &s;ufficient to &s;hew I was not guilty of the incon|&s;i&s;tence he thinks he finds in what I have wrote on this head, p. 199, 200, marg.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> A brief reply to Mr. Hemmenway's an&s;wer to my arguments, proving the unregenerate do no duty.</HEAD>
<P>MY fir&s;t and chief argument to prove the unrege|nerate do no duty was taken from Matth. xxii. 37&mdash;40. and Rom. xiii. 8&mdash;10. Chri&s;t mentioning love to God &amp; our neighbour as required in the fir&s;t &amp; &s;econd commands, &s;ays, 'On the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.' I thought it hence followed that all required in the law and prophets is love: And that this inference was &s;upported and fully a&s;&s;erted by Paul, when he &s;ays 'love is the fulfilling of the law;' and then enumerates a number of commands of the &s;e|cond table, and &s;ays, all the&s;e, and every other command, are briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> Therefore, &s;ince the unregenerate do not love God or their neighbour, they do no part of their duty, nor yield the lea&s;t true obedience to any com|mand.</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y is &s;o far from admitting this argument to be conclu&s;ive, that he takes much pains to overthrow it, and <HI>&s;ays</HI> the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages will prove directly the contrary. His oppo&s;ition to the &s;en&s;e I put upon the words of Chri&s;t, is grounded on the words Mark mentions, as &s;poken by our Lord with re&s;pect to the&s;e two commands, viz. 'There is none other commandment greater than the&s;e.' He &s;ays this nece&s;&s;arily implies there were <HI>other commands,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e which require love.</P>
<P>ANS. He has not proved, nor will he ever do it, that the&s;e words imply there are any other commands. Both may be true, that there is no other command greater than the&s;e; and that there is no other command which is not comprehended in the&s;e. If there is no other com|mand,
<PB N="199" REF="012811_0207_0F8ABE71D450D9F8">
but the&s;e imply the whole; then certainly there is none greater. And it appears from comparing the evangeli&s;ts, that our Lord a&s;&s;erted both. Fir&s;t, that there is none greater; and &s;econdly, that in truth the&s;e comprehend the whole that is required of man; 'On the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the pro|phets.' As if he had &s;aid, 'There is no other command|ment <HI>greater</HI> than the&s;e; and indeed the&s;e are the whole of the law and the prophets; all <HI>depend</HI> on the&s;e, and they compri&s;e the whole. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is &s;aid 'The LORD is greater than all gods.' Exod. xviii. 11. But who ever &s;uppo&s;ed this implied that there were other gods be&s;ides JEHOVAH? Or that this expre&s;&s;ion is incon&s;i&s;tent with its being &s;aid, 'There is no God be&s;ides me. We know that an idol is nothing in the world?' Both the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are true, though more is a&s;&s;erted in the latter, than in the former.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, 'A part of any thing cannot be called another thing than that in which it is contained.' P. 122. ANS. This is a contradiction to his whole &s;cheme. For he &s;ays holine&s;s is a compound made up of many parts; and that the matter of duty is a part of holine&s;s; and yet a&s;&s;erts, this is <HI>another thing than that in which it is contained,</HI> viz un|holine&s;s. See p. 4. But it &s;eems he has now altered his plan on which he fir&s;t &s;et out. <HI>Then</HI> he allowed there was no command that did not require holine&s;s, and corrected me for &s;tating the que&s;tion as if this was denied. But <HI>now</HI> he is proving there are other commands than tho&s;e which require holine&s;s. 'Here I mu&s;t refre&s;h our author's me|mory, which &s;eems <HI>(not)</HI> a little to have failed him.'</P></NOTE></P>
<P>But he further &s;ays, There is nothing in the expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by our Saviour, 'On the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets,' that &s;o much as inti|mates that every command in divine revelation really re|quires nothing but true love. P. 127.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. If there is any command which does not require love, and is not fulfilled by love, it cannot be &s;aid to hang or depend on the&s;e two commands, which require nothing but love. Whatever depends wholly on the&s;e commands, would be wholly aboli&s;hed, or cea&s;e to be a command, if the&s;e commands &s;hould cea&s;e. But if love, and nothing el&s;e, is the fulfiling of every thing required in the law and the prophets, the&s;e words are &s;uited to ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="200" REF="012811_0208_0F8ABE72932B0738">
this. Therefore this is the &s;en&s;e in which they mu&s;t be taken; e&s;pecially as the &s;ame thing is a&s;&s;erted in other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture; and appears every way rea&s;onable. &mdash;When Chri&s;t &s;ays, 'Therefore, all things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them: For this is the law and the prophets.' Matt. vii. 12. he expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame thing, with reference only to the &s;econd command of love to our neighbour. What is here commanded, all grant, is to love our neighbour as our|&s;elves. And how is this the law and the prophets; un|le&s;s it be that this is the thing inculcated in the law and prophets; &s;o that he who comes up to this, does all re|quired in them, &s;o far as they re&s;pect our duty to our neighbour?</P>
<P>And when Paul &s;ays, 'If I have no love, <HI>I am nothing,</HI>' 1 Cor. xiii. 2. he expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame thing; for how could this be true, if the law and the prophets were any thing a&s;ide from love? When Chri&s;t &s;ays, 'He that loveth me not, keepeth not my &s;ayings,' Joh. x<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">v. 24. what could be a more expre&s;s declaration, that there is no obedience where there is no love? Mr. H&mdash;y, in order to &s;upport his &s;cheme, mu&s;t prove that he who loveth not Chri&s;t may keep his &s;ayings. I know that he can ea&s;ily do this, in the way he proves almo&s;t any thing, by his <HI>&s;en&s;u compo&s;ito,</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;u divi&s;o.</HI> But whether he can do it con&s;i&s;tently with <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> let them judge who are willing to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. Mr. H&mdash;y &s;ays
<Q>The love of God and our neighbour is &s;poken of in &s;cripture as a kind of &s;umma|ry of the duty of man.</Q>
P. 35. He al&s;o &s;ays,
<Q>We do indeed allow that nothing is required as duty, but what is either implied in the affection of love, or is a fit way of exerci&s;ing and expre&s;&s;ing it; nothing which may not be con&s;idered as comprehended in love.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author &s;ays, 'Had our Lord thought that tho&s;e two com|mandments <HI>contained all,</HI> he would have &s;aid, there is no other com|mandment <HI>be&s;ides the&s;e.</HI>' P. 122. He here grants they do in truth contain all; and I conclude he will not deny our Lord <HI>thought</HI> this to be truth. And doubtle&s;s he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf perfectly agreeable to this truth, though Mr. H&mdash;y thinks it 'a gro&s;s impropriety of lan|guage.</NOTE> P.
<PB N="201" REF="012811_0209_0F8ABE7349625BE8">
125. In the&s;e words, I think he grants the whole he is di&s;puting again&s;t. For if love is a &s;ummary of the duty of man, then this comprizes the whole of his duty, and he who does not love, does no duty. And if nothing is required as duty but what is implied in love, or a fit way of expre&s;&s;ing it, or comprehended in it; then that which does not imply love, and is not an expre&s;&s;ion of it; is not required, and is no duty.</P>
<P>ANS. 3. The apo&s;tle's words are &s;o plain and expre&s;s, that they cannot be evaded. He &s;ays love fulfils the law; which could not be true if the law required any thing be&s;ides love. He enumerates a number of com|mands, and &s;ays all the&s;e, and <HI>every other</HI> command, is comprehended in that, <HI>thou &s;halt love</HI>; therefore love ful|fils the law, does all that is commanded.</P>
<P>I have &s;uch an opinion of our author's abilities that I do not think he has plea&s;ed him&s;elf in his attempt to evade the force of this pa&s;&s;age. To me it appears &s;o futile and frivolous, as neither to need or de&s;erve an an&s;wer. And the boa&s;ting flouri&s;h he makes in the conclu&s;ion, p. 132, &s;eems rather to be the effect of the weakne&s;s of his argu|ment, than the contrary. But of this, 'let &s;uch as exer|ci&s;e their <HI>rea&s;on</HI> judge.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;ays, it plainly appears, that there are other duties we owe to our neighbour be&s;ides love, from the apo&s;tle's own words, 'Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.' Since 'the apo&s;tle here di&s;tingui&s;hes between rendering to all their due, and loving one another. He compares and <HI>oppo&s;es</HI> the&s;e different duties to each other.' P. 130. I believe none ever before heard of duties which <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> each other. If there are any &s;uch, it is certainly impo&s;&s;ible to do them both at the &s;ame time; as the one mu&s;t be a holy duty, and its oppo|&s;ite a <HI>&s;inful</HI> duty. The apo&s;tle &s;ays, the command, <HI>Thou &s;halt not &s;teal,</HI> is fulfilled by love. If by this we are commanded to pay our ju&s;t debts, then it requires us to owe no man any thing; con&s;equently this is fulfilled by love. How then can the&s;e be di&s;tingui&s;hed as <HI>dif|ferent and oppo&s;ite duties!</HI> This I mention as a &s;pecimen of his way of arguing on this head. I think we may borrow his language with propriety here (p. 34) 'Such metaphy&s;ical flights are, I believe, be|yond the reach of mo&s;t.'</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="012811_0210_0F8ABE7430638AF0">He &s;ays,
<Q>It does not appear that love is ever u&s;ed in &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;en&s;e in the &s;criptures, as to include all tho&s;e acts of external obedience which flow from it.</Q>
P. 126.</P>
<P>ANS. Paul &s;ays it includes all that is commanded in the divine law, as this is all fulfilled by love; and none, I &s;uppo&s;e, will deny that acts of external obedience are commanded. Yea, he particularly mentions a number of commands requiring external obedience, and expre&s;sly &s;ays, love includes all this obedience. And does not John &s;peak of love as including external acts when he &s;ays, 'Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed, and in truth?' 1 Joh. iii. 18. Is not to <HI>love in deed,</HI> to love in external action, i. e. in doing acts of love and mercy? Again, he &s;ays, 'This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.' Chap. v. 3.</P>
<P>As a further evidence that he who does not love, does no duty, nothing that is commanded, I ob&s;erved, that when the people of I&s;rael appeared by their openly wicked con|duct to have no true love to God, they are repre&s;ented as doing nothing that was required of them, while they at|tended the temple &s;ervice, offered &s;acrifices, &amp;c. God calls all their offerings <HI>vain oblations,</HI> and &s;ays, 'Who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? I&s;ai. i. 12, 13.</P>
<P>To this Mr. H&mdash;y &s;ays
<Q>We have no rea&s;on to think that their attendance on the externals of religious wor|&s;hip is here called an abomination, and what was not required of them, merely or principally becau&s;e they were unregenerate.</Q>
P. 203.</P>
<P>ANS. We have rea&s;on to be certain this was becau&s;e they appeared to have no love to God or their neigh|bour, and di&s;covered them&s;elves to be his enemies, which is true of all the unregenerate, and of no other.&mdash;To &s;up|port his ob&s;ervation, he &s;ays,
<Q>At other times, when the
<PB N="203" REF="012811_0211_0F8ABE74D39B7090">
I&s;raelites attended the ordinances of divine wor&s;hip, there is no hint that what they did was not required of them, but the contrary, it is repeatedly &s;aid <HI>they did ac|cording to the commandment of the Lord,</HI> though they act|ed not from a principle of true holine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>ANS. At the&s;e other times, they put on the appearance and profe&s;&s;ion of God's people and &s;ervants, and were vi|&s;ibly holy; for though they were guilty of gro&s;s, open &s;ins, they profe&s;&s;ed repentance, and reformed, and were again re&s;tored to good &s;tanding, as in the ca&s;e of making and wor&s;hiping the golden calf. But the people to whom I&s;aiah &s;peaks, refu&s;ed to reform, though God had been u&s;ing means with them to this end; therefore <HI>appeared</HI> to be impenitent enemies to God.</P>
<P>He thinks I have here fallen into a contradiction to my|&s;elf. I had &s;aid, 'God, in his conduct toward the peo|ple of I&s;rael, and in what he &s;ays of them, acted not as the &s;earcher of hearts; but has re&s;pect only to their ex|ternal appearance and conduct.' Upon this he ob&s;erves,
<Q>It &s;o, it was not the want of inward holine&s;s that was the cau&s;e why their religious performances are declared to be an abomination, and not required at their hands; but it was the irregularity of their outward behaviour.</Q></P>
<P>ANS. God &s;pake of them and treated them, as being his friends or his enemies, i. e. regenerate or unregenerate, according as they <HI>appeared</HI> in their external conduct. Their outward behaviour was not an abomination any further than it proceeded from a wicked heart. Their attendance on religious wor&s;hip would not have been repre&s;ented as an abomination, and what God did not re|quire of them, had they not by their wicked works ap|peared to have no love to God, and to be his enemies, i. e. unregenerate. Had Mr. H&mdash;y under&s;tood me, or the text under con&s;ideration, would he have thought of finding a contradiction here?</P>
<P>But he him&s;elf does not &s;eem to be &s;atisfied with what he has yet &s;aid; and therefore proceeds to ob&s;erve, that the
<PB N="204" REF="012811_0212_0F8ABE758B185CD0">
&s;acrifices and offerings which are &s;aid not to be required, were free-will offerings, which were not commanded. With the&s;e they 'overcharged God's altars,' and for this they were reproved.</P>
<P>ANS. This is a mere conjecture, for which there is not the lea&s;t foundation in the whole pa&s;&s;age; but much to the contrary, as any one may &s;ee who will read it. Would any one think of &s;uch an expedient to get rid of the text, were he not driven to a &s;trait?</P>
<P>Mr. H&mdash;y has an an&s;wer to my other arguments; but as mo&s;t he &s;ays con&s;i&s;ts in making and keeping up his favourite di&s;tinction, between matter of duty, &amp; the man|ner, end and de&s;ign; and duty in a <HI>compound &s;en&s;e,</HI> and in a <HI>divided &s;en&s;e</HI>; which di&s;tinctions are, I think, at be&s;t unintelligible, and tend to darken, rather than give light to the &s;ubject: And if this were not true, they are not to the purpo&s;e, if &s;elf-love is oppo&s;ed to duty, as has been ob&s;erved: I &s;ay, &s;ince this is the ca&s;e, I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf or the reader with a particular reply; concluding that every one who will attend, will &s;ee that what I have &s;aid is a full reply to all he has offered in an&s;wer to the&s;e arguments.</P>

<P>He &s;ays, the unregenerate are under a <HI>natural inability</HI> to embrace the go&s;pel and be holy, in di&s;tinction from a moral inability, it being much more properly called <HI>na|tural</HI> than a <HI>moral.</HI> That it is an inability of a different kind from that which con&s;i&s;ts only in the want of a will|ingne&s;s to do a thing, or oppo&s;ition of will to it, when this may be removed without putting any new principle into the heart; as in the ca&s;e of the reformation of a profligate: Though he is now unwilling to reform, he may be made willing by per&s;ua&s;ion, applying to the principles which he now acts from.

the want of a will, and the oppo&s;ition of their heart to holine&s;s. See p. 10&mdash;30.</P>
<P>I take leave to make the following ob&s;ervations upon this.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we con&s;ult common &s;en&s;e, and the &s;entiments and feelings of mankind in general, we &s;hall find they make no &s;uch di&s;tinction between want of a principle or di&s;po&s;i|tion, by which they are prepared and prompted to will and do any thing, and their unwillingne&s;s, or oppo&s;ition of will to it. If per&s;ons have natural capacity for any thing which is looked upon in it&s;elf right and rea&s;onable, and nothing is wanting but a will, or a compliance of heart, they are always looked upon bound to do it, or to have &s;uch a will and choice; and wholly inexcu&s;able for all defects of this kind. And the further they are from &s;uch a choice, and from having any thing in their mind that will be influenced by the motives &s;et before them, the more they are blamed. Nor are mankind wont to form any notion of two different kinds of difficulty or in|ability in &s;uch ca&s;es; one con&s;i&s;ting in not being willing, while there is a promptitude, or an habitual readine&s;s to will, or a good principle; the other in being wholly with|out any principle or promptitude to the thing propo&s;ed. But when the difficulty lies not in the want of a will, but is &s;uch as can not be removed by any good inclination or choice, and is con&s;i&s;tent with having a good will, it is al|ways looked upon to be of quite a different kind, and oppo&s;ite to the other, as it wholly excu&s;es a per&s;on, &s;o far as he is under this inability. Therefore to call them by the &s;ame name, would be highly improper, and contrary to common &s;en&s;e. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He &s;ays this inability 'is termed by divines, and has not unfitly been called <HI>Ethico-phy&s;ical.</HI>' P. 78, 80. But he has given no in&s;truc|tion by this hard name, as he has not attempted to explain it. He will not &s;urely pretend it is more &s;criptural or intelligible than the word <HI>moral.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. We do not find the lea&s;t hint of any &s;uch di&s;tinction in divine revelation; but this matter is there repre&s;ented agreeable to the common notions and &s;en&s;e of mankind.
<PB N="207" REF="012811_0215_0F8ABF80A104A6E8">
There, as he allows, the unregenerate are repre&s;ented as being as much bound to perfect holine&s;s, as others. Every thing is required of them, that is required of others, with|out making the lea&s;t allowance for any inability they are under: Which could not be, if they were under any <HI>natural</HI> inability to holine&s;s; or if any thing was wanting but a willing heart.</P>
<P>And the &s;cripture repre&s;ents the wicked as under no kind of inability to repent, obey God and embrace the go&s;pel, different from that which they are under to do the common actions of life, when their hearts are oppo&s;ed to them. Therefore their readine&s;s to do the latter, is often mentioned to &s;hew their utter inexcu&s;ablene&s;s and crime in oppo&s;ition of heart to the former. God &s;ets be|fore the Jews, the Rechabites obedience to the command of their father, to illu&s;trate and convince them of their great and inexcu&s;able folly and wickedne&s;s in not obeying him. Jer. xxxv. And our Lord &s;ays to them, 'the Queen of the &s;outh &s;hall ri&s;e in judgment with this gene|ration, and condemn them; for &s;he came from the utmo&s;t parts of the earth to hear the wi&s;dom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.' 'Ye hypocrites, ye can di&s;cern the face of the &s;ky, and of the earth: But how is it, that ye do not di&s;cern this time? Luk. xi. 31. xii. 56. If they were under a different kind of inability to obey God, repent and believe the go&s;pel, from that which men are under to obey men, &amp;c. when they have no will to it, how could the&s;e &s;imilitudes and repre&s;entations be ju&s;t?

'The words <HI>power</HI> and <HI>inability,</HI> have relation to acts. And in order of nature, power is nece&s;&s;ary in order to all acts flowing from it; even as the cau&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary prior to the effect.

<P>It &s;eems to be impo&s;&s;ible to have any conception of &s;uch a principle: And we &s;eem to run into contradictions, in our attempts to de&s;cribe it.

P. 22, 23, 24, &amp;c. At the &s;ame time it is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all acts or exerci&s;es of the mind, as being perfectly inactive. But how that which does not act, can be the cau&s;e of action; and how there can be propen&s;ity and promptitude to act, while there is not the lea&s;t activity, or inclination one way or the other, cannot be told, it is likely, by any divine or philo&s;opher; and will, after all that can be &s;aid, <HI>look</HI> like a contradiction.</P>
<P>And if the holy &s;cripture, when examined with this view, &s;hall be found wholly &s;ilent about this principle, no|thing being there &s;aid that expre&s;&s;es or implies any &s;uch thing, it is thought it will be difficult to find any good medium of proof.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am &s;en&s;ible I &s;hall, by calling in que&s;tion Mr. H&mdash;y's doctrine about principle, expo&s;e my&s;elf to his cen&s;ure, as denying original righhteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;in.

<P N="4">4. Mr. H&mdash;y's account of the nature and kind of man's natural inability to exerci&s;e holine&s;s, and embrace the go&s;|pel,

is not con&s;i&s;tent with his being under any obligations to this, or in the lea&s;t blamable for not being holy. How can he be obliged to do that which he is under a natural inability to do; which defect is not properly a want of will, or oppo&s;ition of will to holine&s;s; but is what the will has no concern in? He &s;ays 'tis mo&s;t properly called natural inability. That 'tis blamable becau&s;e man has brought this inability on him&s;elf by his &s;in; i. e. Adam had abili|ty to be holy, but lo&s;t it for him&s;elf and his children: And becau&s;e he had it, and lo&s;t it, <HI>they</HI> ought to have it, and are now as much to blame for not being holy, as if they had this natural power. But it is impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile the rea&s;on of a man to this, or to make him feel him&s;elf blamable for not doing that for which he has no natural power, even though Adam, or he him&s;elf, once had it. All the blame there can be in this ca&s;e, lies in doing that by which this power was lo&s;t, and not in not being holy, after he lo&s;t his natural power to be &s;o. Mr. H&mdash;y owns he can't account for it, that it &s;hould be &s;o, and &s;peaks of it as one of the greate&s;t my&s;teries in all the bible; but thinks he is obliged to believe it, becau&s;e it is revealed. But this is a my&s;tery of his own making. Ble&s;&s;ed be God! there is no &s;uch thing revealed in the bible. Men are there blamed only for that which natural con&s;cience will make them feel they are wholly blamable for, when pro|perly awakened. And there is no my&s;tery in it: Per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t capacity, and children, may under&s;tand it, condemn them&s;elves and repent. But a per&s;on never re|pents of neglect of that which he thinks he had no natu|ral power to do, and while he can have no conception how or why he &s;hould be blamable. While he views things in this light, and his heart is an&s;werable to his &s;peculations, he will not, he cannot, <HI>feel</HI> him&s;elf guilty, even though he thinks divine revelation declares him to be &s;o, and he <HI>&s;ays</HI> he therefore believes it.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Our author will perhaps think this an uncharitable cen&s;ure of him.

<P>This leads me to take notice of a remarkable in&s;tance of my <HI>uncha|ritablene&s;s,</HI> mentioned by him, p. 215, &amp;c. I had &s;aid in my reply to Mr. Mills,
<Q>The only rea&s;on, I conceive, why any have run into this notion of God's appointing duties to the unregenerate, to be done by them while &s;uch, and have not rather been &s;hocked at it, is, that they look on them as in &s;ome mea&s;ure, at lea&s;t, excu&s;able for not loving God and embracing the go&s;pel; this being above their power, and what they cannot do while unregenerate.</Q>
And I had before publi&s;hed a &s;ermon, in which I &s;aid, They who have not been brought to &s;ee and <HI>feel</HI> them&s;elves wholly inexcu&s;able for not being perfectly holy, have not been convinced of &s;in, as God's people are. The&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages put together, he &s;ays, condemn all without exception as unconverted, who think God has appointed duties to be done by the unregenerate, while &s;uch.</P>
<P>ANS. In my &s;ermon I addre&s;s my&s;elf to my hearers in a u&s;e of exa|mination, de&s;iring them to con&s;ider what are the exerci&s;es and feelings of their own hearts; whether they have been brought to feel them|&s;elves wholly to blame for the neglect of every thing God's law re|quires; or whether they are wont to excu&s;e them&s;elves, as not wholly blamable? And I repre&s;ent the former, not the latter, the character of the Chri&s;tian.&mdash;In my reply, I am not attending to a per&s;on's &s;en&s;e and feelings of heart of his own blamablene&s;s for not loving God, &amp;c. but the views he has of others in a &s;tate of unregeneracy. He may, by the influence of education, &amp;c. imbibe wrong notions re|&s;pecting the blamablene&s;s of the unregenerate, and hold principles in|con&s;i&s;tent with their being in the lea&s;t blamable for not being holy; and be led by this to think and talk of the unregenerate, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure excu&s;able for not loving God, &amp;c. And yet, when he con&s;ults his own heart, and his views and exerci&s;es with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, may find be has no excu&s;e <HI>for him&s;elf,</HI> that he is not perfectly holy. This, I <HI>charitably</HI> believe, is the ca&s;e in many in&s;tances; and in how many, I don't pretend to &s;ay. I hope therefore to be acquitted from the charge Mr. H&mdash;y has laid again&s;t me here, of the 'uncharitable judgment expre&s;&s;ed concerning all differing from me in &s;entiments on this point,' of which he &s;ays, '<HI>I do not remember ever to have met with &s;o hard and exten&s;ive a cen&s;ure.</HI>' And adds, 'This is a &s;ample of the &s;pirit he &s;hews towards <HI>all</HI> differing from his opinion. The lump is <HI>thoroughly fermented</HI> with the &s;ame <HI>&s;our leaven.</HI>' Hard, &s;evere, exten|&s;ive cen&s;ure! Not of my &s;entiments, but of my <HI>&s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ays, 'That there are &s;ome who hold to this notion on rea&s;ons different from what is here a&s;&s;igned, he may now inform him&s;elf.' Where &s;hall I go for information? Not to Mr. H&mdash;y; for he declares he cannot &s;ee how the unregenerate are blamable for not loving God; as they <HI>cannot,</HI> being under a natural inability: Of which &s;entiment he makes great u&s;e through his whole book.</P>
<P>He does not conclude his note without expre&s;&s;ing <HI>his charity,</HI> as a contra&s;t to <HI>my uncharitablene&s;s,</HI> in the following words;
<Q>I can &s;ay, with &s;incerity concerning him, (though he may hereafter twit me with it, as he has done by Mr. Mills, in the like ca&s;e) <HI>I charitably hope that he is a true &s;ervant of Chri&s;t:</HI> Though I mu&s;t add, that Chri&s;tians would regard him with more complacency, if his di&s;cour&s;es favoured more of that meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, recommended by the apo&s;tle. <HI>I may not imitate him in his hard cen&s;ures, for I fear God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall be acquitted from this charge of <HI>hard cen&s;ures</HI> by the reader; or, at lea&s;t, that what I have &s;aid will not be looked upon to be incon&s;i&s;tent with my having the fear of God before my eyes, though Mr. H&mdash;y, it &s;eems, thinks it to be &s;o.</P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervations offer them&s;elves upon reading this &s;en|tence.&mdash;<HI>A true &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, who does not fear God,</HI> if this were po&s;&s;ible, is not a character very honorable to him or his ma&s;ter. If it is a <HI>hard cen&s;ure</HI> to rank a per&s;on among tho&s;e who do not fear God, and &s;uch cen&s;ures are incon&s;i&s;tent with fearing God; then Mr. H&mdash;y, while he is expre&s;&s;ing his charity, does pronounce a hard cen&s;ure on him towards whom he is &s;o charitable; and while he is declaring that he fears God, is doing that which he at the &s;ame time intimates is in|con&s;i&s;tent with it.&mdash;But all this is left to the reader, wi&s;hing there had been no occa&s;ion for any thing which is in &s;uch a degree per&s;onal.</P>
<P>I acknowledge my&s;elf greatly defective in meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, and doubt not my di&s;cour&s;es would favour more of this, had I more of it. Where this defect appears, or that which is contrary to wi&s;dom and humility, as it doubtle&s;s does, in &s;ome in&s;tances at lea&s;t, I a&s;k the can|dor and forgivene&s;s of the offended, Chri&s;tian reader. With how much <HI>meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom</HI> Mr. H&mdash;y has corrected <HI>my pride,</HI> I cheer|fully leave to every reader's judgment, as others are better judges of this, than I am, and this &s;aves me the trouble of remarking on any thing of this kind; and if I &s;hould, different readers will, after all, judge differently: And the point in di&s;pute turns not at all upon this.</P></NOTE></P>

a word which is ob&s;erved by a philo&s;opher to bear about a dozen different &s;ignifications.' If, in&s;tead of con|&s;ulting his philo&s;opher, he had read the page preceding Mr. Edward's definition, where he particularly &s;hews what is commonly meant by nature, he could have been at no lo&s;s about the meaning. This looks like perfect quibbling. Be&s;ides, he has left out of the definition, the words of Mr. Edwards, which are mo&s;t plain, and &s;erve to fix the meaning beyond di&s;pute. Mr. Edwards's words are 'We are &s;aid to be <HI>naturally</HI> unable to do any thing, <HI>when we can't do it if we will,</HI> becau&s;e what is mo&s;t com|monly called nature don't allow of it, &amp;c. i. e. when the difficulty don't lie in the heart or will, but in &s;omething el&s;e; &s;o that if there was a willing mind, the difficulty would not be removed.

I had &s;aid,
<Q>The au|thority of a legi&s;lator is exerci&s;ed and expre&s;&s;ed in the threatening to the di&s;obedient, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be expre&s;&s;ed in any thing el&s;e, or any other way.</Q>

<Q>The authority of a law lies wholly in the threatening, <HI>or appears and is expre&s;&s;ed on|ly in that,</HI> as has been ju&s;t ob&s;erved.</Q>
Mr. H&mdash;y, to an&s;wer his end the better, puts together part of two &s;entences, taken from two differ|ent paragraphs; and then under&s;tands the words, 'The authority of a law <HI>lies</HI> wholly in the threatening' as meaning, 'that the threatening of the law is all that obliges the &s;ubject to obedience; and con&s;equent|ly, if the threatened puni&s;hment could be avoided, it would no longer be our duty to obey the law.' And this, he &s;ays 'is indeed gro&s;s hobbi&s;m; the very dregs of antinomiani&s;m.' P. 31, 32.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay, 'The authority of a law lies wholly in the threaten|ing, <HI>or appears and is expre&s;&s;ed</HI> only in that,' I meant by the la&s;t part of the &s;entence to explain the former, and expre&s;s the &s;ame thing in other words. However inaccurate the expre&s;&s;ion may be, I believe no intelligent, candid reader, who attends to the whole pa&s;&s;age, will be likely to mi&s;take my meaning, viz. that the authority of a legi&s;lator <HI>appears</HI> and <HI>is expre&s;&s;ed,</HI> in his law, in the threatening only.&mdash;But he di&s;putes this too&punc; and &s;ays, 'Nor is it true that the authority of the law <HI>appears only</HI> in the threatening.'

<P>He &s;ays, 'The authority of a lawgiver con&s;i&s;ts in his right to require obedience <HI>under penalty.</HI>' I a&s;k, how this right, to require obedience under penalty, can be expre&s;&s;ed in a law which has no penalty, or does not require obedience under penalty?

<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> On the evil tendency of Mr. Hemmenway's Book.</HEAD>
<P>MR. H&mdash;y has waved the mention of 'the intolera|ble con&s;equences' which appeared to him to be in|&s;eparable from my doctrine; becau&s;e it might look too much like uncharitablene&s;s to dwell on the&s;e things.' P. 202. But it may be que&s;tioned whether his charity, in this in&s;tance, is according to knowledge. Charity is indeed tender of the per&s;on, character, ea&s;e &amp; happine&s;s of every man; but it loves the truth &s;o well, and is &s;o friendly to
<PB N="215" REF="012811_0223_0F8ABF8815979680">
the general good, that when any one publi&s;hes &s;entiments contrary to important truth, and of a fatal tendency to the &s;ouls of men, it will do its utmo&s;t to detect the error, point out the danger and evil tendency of it, and give warning to all, how much &s;oever the author's performance and character may &s;uffer by it. Not to do this, would be un|charitable and cruel. I &s;hall therefore think I am obey|ing the voice of charity it&s;elf, in the attempt I am now entering upon. But before I proceed, I give notice that I de&s;ign not the lea&s;t intimation that Mr. H&mdash;y &s;aw the evil tendency of his &s;cheme, or would de&s;ire to promote what I think is the unavoidable con&s;equence of it. But this is &s;o far from being a rea&s;on for &s;ilence on this head, that it offers a &s;ufficient motive to attempt to open his eyes, and the eyes of all others, who are as far from per|ceiving the danger, as the author.</P>
<P N="1">I. I think what he has &s;aid tends to keep out of &s;ight, and hide from men, their real &s;infulne&s;s and guilt; and therefore oppo&s;es one great end of the gift of the holy &s;pirit, viz. to reprove or convince the world of &s;in, as ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to under&s;tand and embrace the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>He in&s;i&s;ts 'That &s;in con&s;i&s;ts formally and e&s;&s;entially in defect or privation.' P. 8. That this defect, or want of holy principles, is the true cau&s;e of the &s;infulne&s;s of men's actions. P. 64. 'The corruption of human nature con|&s;i&s;ts e&s;&s;entially and radically in a defect or privation of a principle of true holine&s;s. P. 83. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If &s;in con&s;i&s;ts originally and e&s;&s;entially in defect, and this defect is the cau&s;e of the &s;infulne&s;s of men's actions; then this defect was the cau&s;e of Adam's fir&s;t &s;in. I a&s;k, by what means did this defect take place in Adam? Not by his &s;in; for this defect was the cau&s;e of his &s;in. But he gives a different account of Adam's &s;in el&s;ewhere. P. 27, 28. According to him, it con&s;i&s;ted in a <HI>voluntary act,</HI> by which he ca&s;t away the perfection and glory of his nature, and 'the habit or principle of righteou&s;ne&s;s was lo&s;t,' and a u&s;urper was placed on the throne. No &s;inful defect in his nature, or privation of a princi|ple of holine&s;s could be the cau&s;e of this po&s;itive, &s;inful act, becau&s;e this act was the cau&s;e of this defect, and the lo&s;s of the perfection of his nature. And this was a &s;trange <HI>u&s;urper,</HI> if it was only negative, a defect or privation, that is, <HI>nothing.</HI> I think he ought to have given a more clear and con&s;i&s;tent account of that &s;infulne&s;s which con&s;i&s;ts wholly in defect and privation (which I take to be the &s;ame with its con&s;i&s;ting in nothing at all) and is the cau&s;e of the &s;infulne&s;s of men's actions, before he had made &s;uch great u&s;e of it as he does in &s;upport of his &s;cheme.</NOTE> He &s;ays, the prin|ciples and exerci&s;es which are naturally found with men, are not in them&s;elves &s;inful, but the &s;in con&s;i&s;ts in the want of &s;omething el&s;e or their corruption con&s;i&s;ts in not hav|ing &s;upernatural principles joined with them. That &s;elf-love,

love, is innocent and good in it&s;elf, and men never love their own &s;elves too much, or in too high a degree; <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Our author &s;ays,
<Q>No action is the wor&s;e for being intere&s;ted, or or the better for being di&s;intere&s;ted. Di&s;intere&s;ted mi&s;chievou&s;ne&s;s imports the utmo&s;t wickedne&s;s.

P. 98. The&s;e are three as remarkable &s;entences, perhaps, as were ever put together. Nothing can be more contrary to truth and holine&s;s than the fir&s;t.

It is never in any degree &s;inful, unle&s;s when want of love to others has influence in men's actions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. H&mdash;y &s;ays,
<Q>It may &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e who are unac|quainted with <HI>methaphy&s;ics,</HI> that a defect or privation &s;hould be &s;pok|en of as a formal principle, which has an influence in it's kind in|to an action.</Q>
P. 71. If he can by his <HI>metaphy&s;ics</HI> prove this, he will at the &s;ame time prove what has been often a&s;&s;erted, viz. that men by metaphy&s;ics can prove any thing, even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t contradictions, to be true. He adds, what all his readers will doubtle&s;s believe, 'To open this matter <HI>fully</HI> would carry us <HI>too great a length</HI> into &s;ome <HI>ab|&s;tru&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions.</HI>'</NOTE> i, e. When a man is induced by &s;elf-love to 'do that to pro|mote his own intere&s;t which is <HI>in his apprehen&s;ion</HI> incon|&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t of others.' So that if a man has no <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to injure others, to an&s;wer his own ends, &amp; does the matter of duty, his &s;elf-love and all he does is as innocent 'as the action of a &s;ucking infant that reaches earne&s;tly for the brea&s;t.' P. 71, 95, 96. Therefore all that men are blamable for, is want of a principle of love to God and their neighbour. And this being a natural defect,

and they under a natural inability, independent of their will &amp; choice, to act from higher principles, &amp; love God, &amp;c. their &s;infulne&s;s does not lie in this defect, in it|&s;elf con&s;idered, or in any of their neglects or doings; but in their loo&s;ing their power in Adam: For, according to him, if Adam had not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this &s;uperior principle &amp; power, &amp; ca&s;t it away by his voluntary act, his children could not be under the lea&s;t obligation to holine&s;s. But that men &s;hould now be bound to love God and be perfectly holy, when they have no principles, or natural power to do this, merely becau&s;e Adam had them, &amp; ca&s;t them away, he &s;ays, is the mo&s;t difficult to be under&s;tood &amp; accounted for, of any thing contained in the bible; and if it is believed, it mu&s;t be merely becau&s;e 'tis revealed, and not from any inward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s we have of our &s;infulne&s;s and blame, from any inward &s;en&s;e or feeling, or from our &s;eeing the rea&s;on of it; for the&s;e unitedly declare, under all imagina|ble convictions of con&s;cience and illuminations of the mind, there is no &s;infulne&s;s in that, in which <HI>all</HI> &s;infulne&s;s and blame do con&s;i&s;t, if they are to be found in man.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme ot our author does almo&s;t, if not wholly, exclude &s;in and blame from man, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate. He who&s;e heart is formed on this plan, will feel him&s;elf in a great mea&s;ure innocent, and have little &s;in to confe&s;s and repent of. This is very agreeable to un&s;ubdued, im|penitent, &s;ecure &s;inners, &amp; an&s;wers to their views &amp; feel|ings, &amp; the very &s;cheme they naturally fall into, to excu&s;e and ju&s;tify them&s;elves. But when the law comes, &s;in re|vives, and they die. They find that <HI>every imagination of the thoughts of their hearts is only evil continually.</HI> That they are <HI>abominable and filthy, drinking in iniquity like wa|ter</HI>&mdash;That <HI>their heart is deceitful above all things, and de|&s;perately wicked&mdash;Their throat is an open &s;epulchre; with

He refers to it, p. 20, and there under&s;tands it as meaning a &s;tate of unregeneracy, or depraved nature. But in expre&s;s contradiction to this, in p. 97, he &s;ays, 'That which is here called en|mity is not the carnal heart or depraved nature; but the actual exerci&s;e of the heart as depraved.' And here, I think, he runs into another incon&s;i&s;tence. He &s;ays, p. 95, 96, the exerci&s;es of &s;elf-love, in the unregenerate &s;inner, in which 'his de&s;ign is not to hurt others, but to advantage him&s;elf, can, with no propriety, be called exerci&s;es of en|mity to God or man; the action of a &s;ucking infant, that reaches ear|ne&s;tly for the brea&s;t, might as properly be called an exerci&s;e of enmity to being in general.' And yet in the next page he allows the 'exer|ci&s;es and actings of natural principles, as corrupted by &s;in, are uncon|formable to the law of God, and &s;o are <HI>con&s;tructively, at lea&s;t,</HI> enmity again&s;t God, <HI>&s;ince</HI> they are at be&s;t de&s;titute of that rectitude and holi|ne&s;s of principle and end which the law requires.' Thus that which in one page is perfectly innocent, and cannot be enmity to God, is in the next page con&s;tructive enmity at lea&s;t. But no one has any rea&s;on to be frighted with this <HI>con&s;tructive enmity</HI>; for he goes on to &s;ay, 'It does not con&s;i&s;t in exerci&s;e, but in <HI>privation</HI> of right principles and ends in acting. Take this exerci&s;e of the natural principle entire|ly away, and the &s;infulne&s;s of the per&s;on remains undimini&s;hed.' So the enmity of the carnal mind turns out a mere nonentity at la&s;t; &s;uch enmity as a bea&s;t or tree may have.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is doubtle&s;s impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile this &s;criptural repre&s;entation of man's &s;infulne&s;s, with Mr. H&mdash;y's &s;cheme. Indeed, he has, through his whole book, kept the &s;infulne&s;s and guilt of man very much out of &s;ight; and the whole is &s;uited to &s;ooth and plea&s;e the impenitent, unconvinced &s;inner; and is oppo&s;ed to that conviction of &s;in and humiliation which are implied in a man's know|ing his true &s;tate and character, and nece&s;&s;ary in order to embracing the go&s;pel. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is probable Mr. H&mdash;y did not view his own &s;cheme in the light in which I have here &s;et it. And if he &s;hould think I have made a repre&s;entation injurious to him, I can only appeal to his book, and &s;ay I have been careful not to mi&s;repre&s;ent any thing, and really think the judicious reader of what he has wrote, will &s;ee much more oppo&s;ed to a proper conviction of &s;in, than I have mentioned. And &s;ince I have not injured him, <HI>in my own apprehen&s;ion,</HI> he mu&s;t, I think, on his own principles, con&s;ider me as quite innocent.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="219" REF="012811_0227_0F8ABF8D8A05D778">II. Mr. H&mdash;y's book tends to give &s;inners ea&s;e &s;hort of Chri&s;t; to prevent that humiliation which is implied in embracing the go&s;pel; and flatter and confirm them in that &s;elf-righteous way, which is mo&s;t plea&s;ing to their hearts, and in which we have rea&s;on to fear mul|titudes are peri&s;hing.</P>
<P>This appears from what has been ju&s;t ob&s;erved of his hiding from the &s;inner his true &s;infulne&s;s and guilt: For nothing will humble the &s;inner, and &s;trip him of his confidence in him&s;elf, and his &s;elf-righteous pleas and at|tempts, and bring him to feel the utterly helple&s;s, lo&s;t &s;tate he is in, while his true &s;infulne&s;s &amp; guilt are hid from his eyes. But our author does more than this. He tells the awakened &s;inner, he is not wholly a rebel and an enemy to God; but is obeying him, and doing his duty in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by which he obtains God's approbation and fa|vourable notice. This is what the &s;inner, when he is fir&s;t awakened, de&s;ires above all things; and &s;o long as his heart does not fail him here, he will take courage in his oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t, in attempting to obtain a righteou&s;|ne&s;s of his own. And nothing will drive him from this refuge of lies, this &s;elf-righteous bottom, but a conviction that he is &s;o far from doing duty, and obeying God, that he is continually, with his whole heart, oppo&s;ing God and the go&s;pel, and that he never &s;hall do any duty, till his heart is &s;ubdued, and he is willing to embrace the go&s;pel. This is the voice of &s;cripture and rea&s;on. And for the truth of it, I might appeal to the generation of God's people. How many are there to witne&s;s, that &s;o long as they could flatter them&s;elves they were doing duty, they had ea&s;e and &s;elf-confidence. But while they were at|tempting in this way to &s;ave them&s;elves, they were di&s;ap|pointed and confounded: Their &s;infulne&s;s was &s;o brought
<PB N="220" REF="012811_0228_0F8ABF8E0F714710">
into view, that their hearts failed them, and they &s;aw they were not obedient, but rebels in all their exerci&s;es and doings, <HI>&s;in revived and they died.</HI> And how many are there, who have never come to this conviction; but are going on, as they think, in the way of duty, doing all they <HI>can,</HI> or what they have a <HI>next power</HI> to do, <HI>compa&s;&s;ing them&s;elves about with &s;parks that they have kindled!</HI> The&s;e will be greatly comforted and &s;trengthened by what Mr. H&mdash;y has wrote.</P>
<P>In the &s;cripture, a different method is taken with &s;in|ners. Our author has not, I think, found one exhortation there to any duty &s;hort of faith and repentance, after all his &s;earch and attempts; nor one word that implies that the unbeliever does any duty: But there is much there to the contrary. They who are not turned to God, are not &s;poken of as <HI>obeying and doing duty</HI>; but are treated as wholly rebels, altogether <HI>di&s;obedient.</HI> 'To turn the <HI>di&s;obedient</HI> to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t.' Luk. i. 17. '<HI>Chil|dren of di&s;obedience.</HI>' Eph. ii. 2. 'Being abominable and <HI>di&s;obedient,</HI> and unto <HI>every good work reprobate. Di&s;|obedient,</HI> &s;erving divers lu&s;ts, living in malice and envy, hateful, &amp; hating one another. Tit. i. 16. ii. 3. I therefore think I have warrant to &s;ay, in my turn, 'If he could have &s;ubmitted his rea&s;onings to the wi&s;dom of God &s;peak|ing in the &s;ciptures, great part of his peformances would never have &s;een the light.' P. 148.</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed and hoped, however, that what he has wrote, and all the&s;e di&s;putes, though in them&s;elves di&s;agreeable, will be the means of detecting hurtful error; and di&s;covering the true character of &s;inners, given in the holy &s;cripture, and the way of treating with them, there pointed out. So far as this &s;hall come to pa&s;s, <HI>man</HI> will be aba&s;ed, and God alone will be exalted, and have all the glory.</P>
