<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>THAT there has been a con&s;iderable degree of attention given to the &s;ubject of education, and a number of u&s;eful &s;chools e&s;tabli&s;hed, nearly agree|able to the recommendation of the Yearly Meeting, under religious-minded tutors; al&s;o a growing con|cern in the minds of many friends, to provide for the due in&s;truction of the ri&s;ing youth, has been ob|&s;erved with &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Yet when the &s;tate of the young people within the exten&s;ive limits of this Yearly Meeting, is taken into con&s;ideration, with the care manife&s;ted by Friends in Great-Britain, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools for the

benefit of their young people not in affluent circum|&s;tances, as well as others, and attending to the weigh|ty rea&s;ons which have been urged on various occa&s;ions in favor of a more guarded cour&s;e of in&s;truction than is cu&s;tomary, it has been apprehended, that a u&s;e might ari&s;e from having an ab&s;tract of what relates to tho&s;e &s;chools in Great-Britain, mentioned in a publication made by Dr. John Fothergill decea&s;ed, on the in&s;titu|tion at Ackworth, brought more generally into the view of &s;ociety at large, with the &s;en&s;e of Friends in Great-Britain and America, on the &s;ubject of board|ing &s;chools, and the nece&s;&s;ity for a greater care in the education of their young people: for which purpo&s;e I have collected &s;uch materials as would enable me to an&s;wer the expectation of Friends, who may be de&s;irous of information on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject. And as the Meeting for Sufferings, in New-England, has given the &s;en&s;e of their Yearly Meeting on this head, &s;o early as the year 1690, with &s;ome judicious ob&s;ervations, calculated to recommend a greater at|tention to the education of their youth, I &s;hall, therefore, introduce the &s;ubject with a quotation from their epi&s;tle dated the 11th of the 11th month, 1782, &s;igned Mo&s;es Brown,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note,</HI> This Epi&s;tle contains an account of the recommenda|tion of then Yearly Meeting to form an e&s;tabli&s;hment or e&s;tabli&s;h|ments nearly &s;imilar to that at ACKWORTH, anno 178O.</NOTE> as follows, viz.</P>
<P>Their Yearly Meeting recommend
<Q>to Friends every where, as far as they are able or capable,
<PB N="5" REF="022361_0004_0FB84847A0722ED0">
to provide &s;chool-ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es who are faithful Friends, to teach and in&s;truct their chil|dren, and not to &s;end them to &s;uch &s;chools where they are taught the corrupt ways, manners, fa&s;hions, and language of the world, &amp;c.</Q> To which the Meeting for Sufferings add, <Q>The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of attention to which advice has occa&s;ioned the well-concerned among&s;t us, for the happine&s;s of the ri&s;ing generation, and pro&s;perity of truth, to mourn for the hurt thereby &s;u&s;tained in our &s;o|ciety&mdash;Our principles lead to a &s;eparation from the world, its cu&s;toms, habits, language, and manners; how, then, can we hope for faithful &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in our po&s;terity, or that they will come up in principles and practice agreeable thereto, if we continue &s;o far to neglect the <HI>early</HI> care of our offspring, as to &s;end them to &s;chools, where principles and practices &s;o repugnant are taught.&mdash; It is e&s;&s;ential to the continuance of every &s;ociety upon the foundation of its ri&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;hment, that its fir&s;t principles be often recurred to. The principles of light and truth, which fir&s;t &s;eparated our antients from the world, early led George Fox into a &s;ight of the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;eparation from the world in the education of &s;ucceeding ge|nerations.</Q></P>
<P>Which advice, if attended to in &s;ome in&s;tances, has never been &s;o fully regarded as its importance requires; owing to various circum&s;tances which can|not

but be obvious to the well-informed, and which likewi&s;e appears to have been the ca&s;e in Great-Britain, from what has been ob&s;erved by Doctor Fo|thergill, re&s;pecting the &s;chools among&s;t them; and as an account of the&s;e &s;chools may prove &s;atisfactory to many, and &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity for a greater care in the education of our youth, I have been large in my quotations re&s;pecting them, more e&s;pecially as the inconveniences which have attended mo&s;t of them, led to the foundation of that noble in&s;titution at Ackworth, and appear to be the &s;ame which we have experienced in America, with other circum|&s;tances which are mentioned.</P>
<P>In the account of the&s;e &s;chools we are informed
<Q>of one at Gilder&s;ome in York&s;hire, which was &s;et on foot by the activity of Friends, who have the immediate care of it, and from whom it has re|ceived a generous &s;upport; yet as it is only pro|vided for by the liberality of friends within the limits of the neighbourhood, or of the Monthly Meeting of Brighou&s;e, by who&s;e genero&s;ity it was &s;et on foot, it was thought the plan was <HI>too con|fined</HI> to admit of that u&s;efulne&s;s, which that at Ackworth promi&s;ed: e&s;pecially as the <HI>price of education</HI> was nece&s;&s;arily greater, as was found on experience; altho' by the activity of Friends, who had the care of it, Gilder&s;ome &s;chool has proved beneficial to many children, and occa&s;i|oned many to be brought from a great di&s;|tance.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="022361_0006_0FB8484AA2A34F40">
<Q>Be&s;ides this, there is another hou&s;e for the edu|cation of Friends' children, which has been founded in London, and &s;upported almo&s;t &s;olely by Friends of the Quarterly Meeting of London, that is, Friends' &s;chool-hou&s;e and workhou&s;e at Clerken|well; the following circum&s;tances are mentioned re&s;pecting it: many well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, on con|&s;idering the &s;tate of the poor in LONDON, appre|hended that many of the aged, as well as the chil|dren of divers, might be better &s;upported and more &s;uitably educated, were they collected toge|ther in one place, where every thing nece&s;&s;ary for their well-being might be provided, more to their comfort than at their own habitations. Accord|ingly about the year 1700, this bu&s;ine&s;s was un|dertaken and liberally proceeded in, and was &s;o prudently conducted, that it drew many per&s;ons of note of other per&s;ua&s;ions, to vi&s;it it; which was the means of deriving credit to the &s;ociety, and of exciting a degree of the like attention to &s;uch u&s;eful undertakings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A committee of eighteen Friends, cho&s;en from the &s;everal Monthly Meetings, meet for the mo&s;t part once a month to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e; be&s;ides weekly vi&s;itors who in&s;pect at <HI>un|certain &s;ea&s;ons</HI> the conduct of the family.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Under &s;uch management it cannot be wonder|ed at, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould become con|&s;iderable.
<PB N="8" REF="022361_0007_0FB8484C21F88498">
The fund is about &pound;. 20,000; ari&s;ing from the genero&s;ity and beque&s;ts of individuals among Friends in that metropolis, a very few in|&s;tances excepted; in which &s;um is included a le|gacy left by our decea&s;ed friend, Devereaux Bow|ley of London, of THREE THOUSAND POUNDS.</Q></P>
<P>But it appears from a local circum&s;tance that the benefits derived from this in&s;titution have not been in every re&s;pect equal to the hopes of Friends;
<Q>too few of the youth educated, the number con&s;idered, having turned out u&s;eful or reputable members of &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P>Two cau&s;es are a&s;&s;igned for this di&s;appointment; one is,
<Q>the &s;cholars were permitted too frequently to be in the &s;treets, al&s;o had liberty at times to vi&s;it their friends and relations, not always the mo&s;t exemplary in their conduct; by which means they contracted ill manners and wor&s;e prac|tices, and returned to the hou&s;e in every re&s;pect wor&s;e than when they left it." Another cau&s;e a&s;|&s;igned is, "that a con&s;iderable number of antient poor are maintained under the &s;ame roof&punc; &s;ome of whom have been brought to this &s;ituation by their mi&s;conduct, and con&s;equently, not the mo&s;t likely per&s;ons to &s;et the children a commendable example.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this hou&s;e the poor of the &s;ociety of London are em|ployed and provided for.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="022361_0008_0FB8484D9E80C6E0">One other &s;chool is mentioned which &s;hows the pernicious influence of bad example, which is wor|thy of notice;
<Q>A &s;chool-hou&s;e was built, an able and well-qualified ma&s;ter procured, and three thou|&s;and pounds generou&s;ly &s;ub&s;cribed by Friends, for a day-&s;chool: but &s;uch was the ill effects of the children <HI>mixing with others,</HI> &s;o much were they hurt by bad examples and bad company, that tho&s;e who had engaged in the generous de&s;ign, found it nece&s;&s;ary to abandon it, merely, as it ap|peared, from this circum&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;chool at Clerkenwell has lately had divers beque&s;ts made to it for the purpo&s;e of increa&s;ing apprentice-fees, and further encouragement to &s;uch children of both &s;exes as may de&s;erve it after a certain age, and &s;ome regulations have been made to prevent the youth mixing with others; with a view to pre&s;erve them from the influence of bad example.</Q></P>
<P>How far Friends' care in this re&s;pect may be at|tended with the de&s;ired benefits in that large metro|polis, we are yet to learn in the conduct of the youth who may be brought up at that &s;chool: that con&s;i|derable endeavours were not u&s;ed previous to the publication of the&s;e remarks, cannot be urged as an objection to a more &s;elect and guarded education, as will appear by the following &s;hort account of
<PB N="10" REF="022361_0009_0FB8484F2F20A2E0">
Friends' labor to pre&s;erve them in <HI>&s;o expo&s;ed a &s;itua|tion.</HI> "There is not," proceeds the &s;aid Friend,
<Q>an in&s;titution exi&s;ting, upon which more labor and di&s;intere&s;ted endeavours, that every thing might be managed with order, oeconomy, reputa|tion, and general benefit, have been employed, than in this hou&s;e (Clerkenwell:) &s;uch is the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving youth from the influence of bad example, if we hope to pre&s;erve them in in|nocence and &s;implicity.</Q></P>
<P>The importance of a right education is &s;uch, that it is no occa&s;ion of &s;urpri&s;e when we con&s;ider the failure of tho&s;e in&s;titutions already mentioned, of an&s;wering all the &s;alutary purpo&s;es expected from them, with the concern of friends, as mentioned in the following extract from the Minutes of the Year|ly Meeting of Great-Britain in 1777, that they &s;hould be induced to turn their attention to this &s;ub|ject on an enlarged plan, &s;o as to obviate the incon|veniences which they had &s;o di&s;couragingly experi|enced. The extract is as follows, viz.</P>
<P><Q>It is the renewed concern of this Meeting to recommend a care for the offspring of &s;uch pa|rents, who&s;e earnings or incomes are &s;o &s;mall as to render them incapable of giving their children a &s;uitable and guarded education, and that e&s;peci|ally from home, by which they may be prevent|ed from mixing with others who are not of our
<PB N="11" REF="022361_0010_0FB848519B0B2050">
religious per&s;ua&s;ion, which &s;o often leads into hurt|ful habits, from which they are not afterwards ea&s;ily reclaimed: and as &s;ome of our members may in|cautiou&s;ly permit their offspring to &s;uffer this great lo&s;s, rather than apply for a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their Monthly Meetings; it is recommended to Friends in every Monthly Meeting, to &s;eek out &s;uch of their members as may be thus &s;traitened, and ad|mini&s;ter to their help, and it is de&s;ired that &s;uch will receive the &s;alutary aid with a willing mind, and thankfulne&s;s to the great Author of all good. And it being the judgment of this meeting that encouragement for boarding &s;chools, &s;uitable for the education of children who&s;e parents are not in affluence, will be advantageous, the con&s;idera|tion of a plan for that purpo&s;e is referred to the Meeting for Sufferings, to be laid before this Meeting next year; to which Friends in the coun|try are al&s;o de&s;ired to join their attention and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances gave occa&s;ion to the pur|cha&s;e of a large and commodious building which had been erected at a place called ACKWORTH, in York&s;hire, for a Foundling HOSPITAL, but through mi&s;management had been left un&s;upport|ed.</P>
<P><Q>This building with the premi&s;es was offered for &s;ale for &pound;. 7000, a purcha&s;er having appeared
<PB N="12" REF="022361_0011_0FB84852E3E11EA0">
who offered &pound;. 6800 for it: in con&s;equence of which the matter was laid before the Meeting for Sufferings. This Meeting, upon deliberation, were de&s;irous to refer the &s;ubject to the con&s;idera|tion of the en&s;uing Yearly Meeting; but this was nece&s;&s;arily prevented by the unexpected ap|pearance of the other purcha&s;er: this induced a number of Friends to &s;tep forward with an offer to bear the Meeting for Sufferings harmle&s;s, &s;hould the Yearly Meeting decline the purcha&s;e: this be|ing accepted, a contract for the buildings, &amp;c. was made, and the matter re&s;erved for the deter|mination of the Yearly Meeting in 1778, when it was agreed to, and became a &s;ociety concern.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall be more particular in what relates to this &s;chool, as it furni&s;hes us with an in&s;tance of great liberality in Friends of Great-Britain, and the regu|lations intended to be (and which afterwards were) introduced into that &s;chool are proper for imitation, and may be con&s;idered as part of the Plan of education now propo&s;ed for the young people in the&s;e parts: for which rea&s;ons I hope it will nei|ther prove unacceptable nor u&s;ele&s;s. I &s;hall there|fore proceed.</P>
<P>Previous to the Yearly Meeting coming to a de|termination,
<Q>a committee of one Friend out of every county, together with the Meeting for Suf|ferings, with any others who cho&s;e to attend, was
<PB N="13" REF="022361_0012_0FB8485527E47E70">
early appointed to take this weighty &s;ubject into con&s;ideration, after various meetings of their com|mittee, a report was agreed to, recommending, be&s;ides the purcha&s;e of the buildings, &amp;c. a &s;ub|&s;cription to be &s;et on foot during the &s;itting of the Meeting, by donations, by annuities on two lives, at 5 per cent. each,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The per&s;on who choo&s;es to make his &s;ub&s;cription in this way, names any two per&s;ons, and fixes a &s;um, on which he agrees to pay 5 per cent. per annum during the continuance of their two lives, be they longer or &s;horter.</NOTE> and by bills of admi&s;|&s;ion at eight guineas each:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is apprehended, the per&s;on who &s;ub&s;cribes in this way is entitled, for every eight guineas he &s;ub&s;cribes, to a ticket, which will give admittance to any per&s;on into the &s;chool for one year to whom he plea&s;es to pre&s;ent it, provided they are approved of by the committee nominated for that purpo&s;e.</NOTE> after deliberate con|&s;ideration, the report was received by the Yearly Meeting, and the propo&s;ed &s;ub&s;cription was be|gun, and &s;trongly recommended to the coun|ties.</Q></P>
<P>Upon which proceedings our friend John Fother|gill ob&s;erves;
<Q>The great unanimity that prevailed in the &s;everal &s;ittings of the committee, apparently proceeding from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the want of &s;ome &s;uch in&s;titution; the cordial, tho' not ha&s;ty, con|currence of the Yearly Meeting with the report of the committee; and the generous exertions of many Friends in con&s;equence of this concurrence, afforded &s;uch an indication of the propriety of the
<PB N="14" REF="022361_0013_0FB848572370A5A8">
concern, that FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS was &s;ub|&s;cribed in three or four days, and di&s;pelled all the doubts he had entertained about it.</Q></P>
<P>ACKWORTH is &s;ituate in York&s;hire, about 180 miles from London; the building appears by a front view given of it, in the account from which the&s;e extracts were made, nearly to re&s;emble the &s;tate-hou&s;e in Philadelphia, and equally exten&s;ive, be&s;ides having two wings, which, with the centre buildings, form a hollow &s;quare: the whole being in good repair, large, commodious, and judiciou&s;ly con|trived; every convenience in the arrangement of the apartments &s;eems to have been attended to, and no kind of office or out-hou&s;e omitted, which might be nece&s;&s;ary for the accommodation of a large family; hence it appears to have been a circum&s;tance peculi|arly favorable to Friends' views, that this building with the appurtenances was to be had at this time.</P>
<P>By a ground-plot it appears, that there was about 85 acres of land belonging to the premi&s;es, and pur|cha&s;ed with them, containing a garden and other in|clo&s;ures: &s;ince then there has been added about 40 acres more, which they were enabled to purcha&s;e by legacies left for that particular purpo&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In future it is intended that all donations or beque&s;ts of &pound;. 50. or upwards, be placed out &s;o as to form a fund, and the principal not to be applied towards the current expen&s;es of the in&s;titution.</NOTE></P>

<P><Q>Many children among&s;t us (proceeds the &s;aid Friend) &s;u&s;tain a grievous lo&s;s by not being early and properly made acquainted with the principles we profe&s;s. For want of this in&s;truction, they become too ea&s;y a prey to the cu&s;toms of the world and its habitudes; and that which would be as a kind of hedge about them, and pre&s;erve from many temptations, is laid wa&s;te, and all the allurements of vice and folly &s;uffered to &s;educe their affections to their ruin. For when they cea&s;e to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from others by their garb and deportment, they too often cea&s;e to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from the world by their morals, and the recti|tude of their conduct.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is therefore intended to make the children of both &s;exes acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of Friends, their &s;ufferings, and

the indulgences granted them by the legi&s;lature, as well as the general doctrines of religion and morality," and to train them up in the knowledge of the &s;acred writings; on which there is this re|mark: "Too few are the parents who can hone&s;tly &s;ay, that they train up their children in a godly conver&s;ation; in plainne&s;s of &s;peech, behaviour, and apparel; and the frequent reading of the Holy Scriptures. Here (at Ackworth) care will be taken both of their principles and conduct: be|&s;ides, it is hoped that &s;uitable opportunities will be embraced of cheri&s;hing in their tender minds, obedience to the inward principle of light and truth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And as it is of great importance to habituate children from their infancy to &s;ilence and attenti|on, not only as a preparative to their advance|ment in a religious life, but as the ground-work of a well cultivated under&s;tanding, it will be par|ticularly regarded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To watch over the human heart is a circum&s;tance of greater importance than mankind in general &s;eem to under&s;tand.</NOTE> We are almo&s;t the only pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, who acknowledge the u&s;e of this ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary introduction to Chri|&s;tian knowledge and Chri&s;tian practice. To have the active minds of children early put under this kind of re&s;traint, to be accu&s;tomed to turn their attention from external objects, and habituated to

a degree of ab&s;tracted quiet, is a matter of great con&s;equence, and may be of la&s;ting benefit to them. To this they are inured in our a&s;&s;emblies, and to &s;it in &s;ilence with decency and compo&s;ure. Tho' it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed their young and active minds are always engaged as they ought to be, yet to be accu&s;tomed thus to &s;tillne&s;s, and brought to curb and re&s;train the &s;allies of their youthful di&s;|po&s;itions, is no &s;mall point gained towards fixing a habit of patient recollection, and a regard to de|corum, which &s;eldom for&s;akes tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to it, and have been properly in|&s;tructed in this entrance to the &s;chool of wi&s;dom, during the re&s;idue of their days.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If it was needful it might not be difficult to &s;hew, from abundant authority and rea&s;on it&s;elf, the va&s;t aid afforded to the improvement of the human mind, by early habits of &s;ilent attention.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been thought that a u&s;e would ari&s;e from a care in the ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, to have their &s;chools adjourned with greater decorum than is generally the practice; and that a &s;hort pau&s;e previous thereto would afford them an opportunity, when nece&s;&s;ary, to extend &s;uitable reproof or encouragement, as well as to di&s;mi&s;s their &s;cholars more in the quiet.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="022361_0020_0FB8486A267F7FD0">To which he &s;ubjoins, as a further motive for en|gaging in the undertaking,
<Q>And as there are many children, who, by the remotene&s;s of their parents' &s;ituation from meetings, are de&s;titute of &s;uch op|portunities, it is another call to the &s;ociety, to pre|vent as much as po&s;&s;ible the lo&s;s ari&s;ing from &s;uch a circum&s;tance. To this con&s;ideration it will not be improper to add another which is connected with it, and that is, the want of opportunities of &s;ending their children to Friends' &s;chools; by which means, if they have any learning at all af|forded them, it is under the tuition of &s;uch as are mo&s;tly &s;trangers to our principles, and the practices derived from them, plainne&s;s of &s;peech, &s;implicity of manners, and that beginning of wi&s;|dom which is in&s;pired by the fear of the Lord. On the contrary, they are liable to a&s;&s;ociate with &s;uch children as are unacquainted with all the&s;e things, taught to deride tho&s;e who practi&s;e them, and live at large to appetite and cu&s;tom: and how often does it happen that the children of Friends in &s;uch &s;ituations, bred up with unprincipled, li|centious youth, form connexions with them, to their own great hurt, the di&s;tre&s;s of their parents, and the lo&s;s of many valuable members to &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is propo&s;ed, when the &s;chool is opened, a meeting for wor&s;hip &s;hall be held in the hou&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which is accordingly done.</NOTE>

every fir&s;t-day morning and afternoon: likewi&s;e a meeting on the fourth day of the week, the&s;e times being judged mo&s;t convenient.</Q></P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of the care which was intended to be taken with the youth in that &s;chool, the follow|ing quotation may not be unacceptable, viz.</P>
<P><Q>Perhaps (&s;ays our Friend) there is nothing in the cour&s;e of public education in the world, that &s;o unfits men for that humble attention to the di|vine monitor within, renders them &s;uch perfect &s;trangers to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity and all its happy effects, as the cultivation of a bold, unfeel|ing di&s;po&s;ition, under a notion of promoting man|line&s;s and courage: it too often &s;ets a&s;ide that great defence and ornament of youth, a mode&s;t, ingenuous temper, accu&s;toms them to throw off all the re&s;traints of duty and affection, and at length to bid defiance to intreaty, admonition, and reproof. At Ackworth, endeavours will be u&s;ed to form in the children a temper widely different, equally remote from a culpable fear and &s;ervility, and an audacity that knows no re&s;pect for order or authority.</Q></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the dre&s;s of the children at that &s;chool, it is remarked,

regard being had to the dre&s;s of the different &s;exes;" he &s;ays, "for various rea&s;ons the propo|&s;al is a good one. The children there ought to value them&s;elves on no other &s;uperiority than that of behaving them&s;elves better than others, both in re&s;pect to learning and conduct. They are all to con&s;ider them&s;elves, and be con&s;idered, as the chil|dren of one family, under the care of that body, which deeply intere&s;ts it&s;elf in the welfare of them all. The riches, the poverty, the good or bad conduct of their connexions, mu&s;t have no other regard paid to them, than &s;uch as may proceed from the nece&s;&s;ity of guarding them from the in|fluence of any circum&s;tances prevailing to their future di&s;advantage.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude what relates to the &s;ubject of the children's education, I &s;hall add the following ju|dicious ob&s;ervation;
<Q>Tho' the children's improve|ment in learning, their health, and other &s;uita|ble accommodations, are matters of great mo|ment in &s;uch an in&s;titution as this, yet there is one of a &s;uperior nature, to promote a tender, teachable di&s;po&s;ition, inuring them to bear that yoke in their youth, which will moderate their de&s;ires, and make way for the &s;oftening influence of divine good-will in their hearts, fitting them for the faithful di&s;charge of every duty in life, yielding content in affliction, moderation in pro&s;pe|rity, becoming at once the &s;afeguard and ornament

of every &s;tage in life, from youth to ripe old age.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This &s;hould be the con&s;tant, uniform endeavour of tho&s;e who may be engaged in the immediate care and &s;ervice of the family, in whatever &s;tation they may be placed: for the encouragement, of tho&s;e who may be thus engaged, he adds, "it is hoped they will bear &s;ome little difficulties, &s;hould they occur, as endeavours will be u&s;ed to pre|vent them, &s;o that the good of the youth com|mitted to their care &s;hall be built as little as po&s;|&s;ible on the &s;ufferings of any individual.</Q></P>
<P>As the&s;e ob&s;ervations will convey &s;ome idea of the education which is de&s;ired for our young people, and the nature of the in&s;titution which is now propo&s;ed, I hope it will be needle&s;s to apologize for their length, and it may be &s;ufficient to add, that &s;chool has been conducted nearly agreeable to the&s;e princi|ples, much to the &s;atisfaction of Friends, as far as we learn, and there is a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of its con|tinuing exten&s;ively u&s;eful to &s;ociety, and beneficial to the youth who may be educated therein.</P>

<P>TO ripen this concern, and to prepare it for the con&s;ideration of Friends in a collective capaci|ty, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that a PLAN more particularly accommodated to our circum&s;tances would be u&s;eful. With this view the following outlines of one are &s;ug|ge&s;ted. If it &s;hould not meet with general approba|tion in all its parts, it is to be hoped that it will not prove a di&s;couragement to the undertaking; as it cannot be doubted, that a &s;olid committee of the Yearly Meeting would be enabled to improve upon any hints that might be offered for con&s;ideration by an individual, and that &s;uch parts as may appear ex|ceptionable, would be either explained or expunged, and &s;uch others added, as would bring it into a &s;tate to meet with general acceptance.</P>
<P>The PLAN is as follows:</P>
<P N="1">I. It has been thought advi&s;able that a &s;tanding committee be appointed by the Yearly Meeting, ve&s;ted with all the nece&s;&s;ary powers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The epi&s;tle on this &s;ubject from the Meeting for Sufferings, in New-England, particularizes what is meant by the&s;e powers, and may be referred to, &s;hould information be wanting.</NOTE> to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s relating to this concern in its fulle&s;t extent; their proceedings and conduct to be &s;ubject to the direction and revi&s;ion of the &s;aid Meeting, as it may think proper.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="26" REF="022361_0025_0FB848742EC7CCB0">II. That a tract of good land of 1000 acres be purcha&s;ed in a healthy &s;ituation, not too remote from the &s;eat of the Yearly Meeting, where &s;uitable build|ings be provided or erected, according to the views of Friends, &s;o as to accommodate the &s;cholars and all others concerned on the premi&s;es, and the land occupied in &s;uch way as will be&s;t contribute to afford &s;upplies to the &s;cholars, and promote the in&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P N="3">III. That it be recommended to Friends in the &s;ubordinate Meetings to encourage a free, voluntary, and liberal contribution for this purpo&s;e, which &s;hould be continued from time to time until a permanent and adequate provi&s;ion be obtained.</P>
<P>Note, I have propo&s;ed a much larger tract of land for the u&s;e of the in&s;titution among&s;t us than they have at Ackworth, for the&s;e rea&s;ons: land of equal quality is to be had at a much lower price here, where it would &s;uit for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, than in Great-Bri|tain; and the product of land properly occupied would afford a better return for money than could be had in any other way, for the &s;upply of the fami|ly with nece&s;&s;ary food, fuel, timber, &amp;c. and after having overcome the difficulty of a fir&s;t purcha&s;e, would become a permanent and improving e&s;tate; and a foundation might be laid for a &s;ettlement where artificers and hu&s;bandmen would be collected to in|&s;truct many youth in various branches of bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="27" REF="022361_0026_0FB848756020F1F0">
free from the corrupt examples which a mixture of different people might occa&s;ion, as well as other ad|vantages that would probably attend it, which need not be mentioned.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That regular minutes be kept of all pro|ceedings and expenditures, with the &s;ums &s;ub&s;cribed, or the e&s;tates granted, and which may be receiv|ed, or remain in rever&s;ion; with all other matters relative to, and for the &s;upport of, this e&s;tabli&s;h|ment; &s;o as to afford a clear view of the &s;tate of the in&s;titution and fund belonging to it; in order that proper endeavours may be u&s;ed, and &s;uitable advice extended from year to year, for the encouragement and &s;upport of the undertaking.</P>
<P N="5">V. Be&s;ides u&s;eful learning, the boys and girls are to be in&s;tructed in &s;uch manual bu&s;ine&s;s and do|me&s;tic employments of every kind, as may be con|&s;i&s;tent with Friends' pro&s;pects of u&s;efulne&s;s and im|provement, or redound to the benefit and reputa|tion of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P N="6">VI. In providing of buildings regard is to be had to &s;uch as may be nece&s;&s;ary for trade&s;men and others, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance may be required, either for labor or the in&s;truction and accommodation of the youth, <HI>ac|cording to the extent of the fund,</HI> as well as for the accommodation of tho&s;e who may have occa&s;ion to re&s;ort to, or be re&s;ident at, the place; and it is to
<PB N="28" REF="022361_0027_0FB84876E1F0BC68">
be ob&s;erved, that none be permitted to be re&s;ident there, but &s;uch as are of &s;ober, exemplary conduct, and pious conver&s;ation; that the youth may be in|&s;tructed in &s;uch way that there may be a rational pro&s;pect of their being pre&s;erved in innocence.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That a &s;teward and clerk, with a man and wo|man Friend to act as &s;uperintendants, be appointed; the two latter continually or occa&s;ionally to in&s;pect into the &s;tate of the &s;chools, the places of accommo|dation and maintenance of the youth, and report to the committee of the Yearly Meeting, the &s;tate of things from time to time, extend the advice of the &s;aid committee with their rules and orders to all concerned, and &s;ee to the due execution of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e general heads of a plan, &s;ome other rules will be nece&s;&s;ary for the government of the &s;chools, and accommodation of the families; the di&s;cipline to be ob&s;erved by the youth, and order to be e&s;tabli&s;hed where they are boarded; as well as for the improvement to be made on the premi&s;es, and management of the farms, with a view to pro|vide for the &s;upport of the family, tend to the im|provement of the young people, and add a reputation to the &s;chool; likewi&s;e to pre&s;erve order and e&s;ta|bli&s;h a nece&s;&s;ary &s;y&s;tem of oeconomy, &s;o as to afford a proper &s;upply without profu&s;ion or wa&s;te: all which &s;hould be attended to by the general committee of
<PB N="29" REF="022361_0028_0FB84878BB1BE1B8">
the Yearly Meeting, as there may be occa&s;ion, with &s;uch other matters as may be needful.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e very pertinent remarks made by our valued friend John Fothergill decea&s;ed, with a view to pro|mote the moral and religious improvement of the youth, will no doubt claim the attention of tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the management of this in&s;titution, as objects of &s;uperior con&s;equence; or any hints for that purpo&s;e which may be &s;ugge&s;ted by Friends of experience.</P>
<P>To enter into every minute circum&s;tance which will be proper for their attention, cannot be nece&s;&s;a|ry on this occa&s;ion: yet, as a few leading rules for the government of tho&s;e concerned, may be of fu|ture u&s;e, and afford to others a more &s;atisfactory view of the de&s;ign, as well as prove an encourage|ment to &s;ome to unite in their endeavours to pro|mote it, or induce them to entru&s;t the care of their tender offspring at &s;uch a place, the following are &s;ubjoined by way of information, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. The hou&s;es for the accommodation of the youth are propo&s;ed to be of a moderate &s;ize, and at proper di&s;tances from each other, with nece&s;&s;ary apart|ments, &amp;c. &s;o as to afford comfortable accommodati|ons to the children, who ought not to be crowded in too great numbers together, that they may have
<PB N="30" REF="022361_0029_0FB8487AC3AA9170">
the benefit of a private re&s;idence and a public educa|tion at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P N="2">II. That each family con&s;i&s;t of not more than the man and woman Friend who are to board the &s;cho|lars, with their children, and the nece&s;&s;ary dome&s;tics, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The number is left for future con&s;ideration.</NOTE> <HI>pupils,</HI> whereby they may with more ea&s;e extend the nece&s;&s;ary care and attention to the conduct of the youth; apply &s;uitable advice, admonition, or reproof, or occa&s;ionally, by kind and gentle treat|ment, encourage tho&s;e who may require it; be&s;ides, the health of the young people would be more like|ly to be pre&s;erved, when not too numerous in one family; their accommodations made more agreeable, as well as more &s;uitable to their age, &s;o that in ca&s;e of indi&s;po&s;ition they might be better attended, and their wants more &s;uitably relieved: nor would it be le&s;s conducive to their general improvement; as the girls might, by rotation, as they became able, be a&s;|&s;i&s;ting in dome&s;tic employments, &s;o as to qualify them in turn to fill up tho&s;e &s;tations in &s;ociety which may fall to their allotment, with propriety: the boys likewi&s;e may find a &s;hare, and not unprofitably, in tho&s;e duties, added to the care of the gardens, &amp;c. whereby they would find employment for their lei&s;ure hours, be taught to fill up a painful vacancy by &s;ome profitable labor, derive in&s;truction from the ob&s;er|vation of the works of Providence, be benefited by

moderate exerci&s;e, and probably enjoy
<Q>a healthy mind with a healthy body:</Q>
and might have afford|ed to many young people who have been brought up in cities or large towns, advantages which cannot be obtained in &s;uch places.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;chool-hou&s;es for the boys &s;hould be &s;ituate at a convenient di&s;tance from tho&s;e for the girls, to prevent any improper familiari|ties: likewi&s;e that they be boarded in different hou|&s;es; yet not &s;o far &s;eparated but that an innocent and cheerful intercour&s;e may be allowed and en|couraged under &s;uitable in&s;pection at proper &s;ea|&s;ons:</P>
<P N="4">IV. And that each one employed be generally confined to their re&s;pective duties. The youth had better not be boarded with their tutors; as it might draw their attention from their &s;chooling, and occa&s;ion a greater burden than ought to be the &s;hare of any individual, be&s;ides other inconveniences which might attend it; it is therefore propo&s;ed, that the per&s;ons who board the youth &s;hould confine them|&s;elves to the care of their wards, and &s;ee that they give proper attendance at &s;chool, and al&s;o watch over their general conduct and attention to religi|ous duties.</P>
<P N="5">V. Care &s;hould likewi&s;e be taken to prevent rambling in the &s;cholars, as well as unprofitable
<PB N="32" REF="022361_0031_0FB8487DF47B5168">
collections of neighbouring people at lei&s;ure &s;ea&s;ons, in &s;uch a manner as might di&s;turb the order and quiet of the family.</P>
<P>Having taken into con&s;ideration &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces as opened in my view, as mo&s;t likely to promote the accommodation of the youth, and tend to their pre&s;ervation in innocence, what relates to their in|&s;truction is &s;o well known and &s;o judiciou&s;ly encou|raged by Friends, that at this time it only remains for me to add, with re&s;pect to the intention of this in&s;titution, that it is de&s;igned to provide for any who may need the benefit of &s;uch a &s;chool; the wealthy and tho&s;e who are not in affluent circum&s;tan|ces are intended to be alike the objects of Friends' care, with this di&s;tinction only, that tho&s;e who can afford it, may be accommodated, &s;chooled, and &s;up|ported on &s;uch rea&s;onable terms as &s;hall be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the committee of the Yearly Meeting; but tho&s;e not in affluence &s;hall receive the &s;ame advantages ei|ther free of co&s;t, or at &s;uch moderate charge as may be &s;uited to their circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>A plan &s;o large and calculated to be &s;o exten&s;ively u&s;eful, may &s;tartle &s;ome who have been accu&s;tomed to view things on a more contracted &s;cale, appear to be difficult in the execution, and be &s;uppo&s;ed to ex|ceed the abilities of the &s;ociety: with re&s;pect to the&s;e points, the pro&s;pects of &s;ome may differ until the ex|periment be made; it may be remembered that there

is nothing new in the de&s;ign, nor in the execution;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The extraordinary in&s;tance of the &s;chool at Glaucha, near Hall in Saxony, is worthy of notice on this occa&s;ion. Au|gu&s;tus Herman Franck, a German mini&s;ter at that place, un|dertook, from motives of humanity, to &s;chool and provide &s;upport for poor children, who&s;e ignorance had excited his compa&s;&s;ion; for which purpo&s;e he fixed up a charity-box in his place of re&s;idence, with an in&s;cription on it intimating his de&s;ign: upon which &s;ome per&s;on was moved, in about a quarter of a year afterwards, to put into his box to the value of 18<HI>&s;</HI>6 &s;terling at one time; which &s;o encouraged this pious per&s;on, that he re&s;olv|ed to lay the foundation of a charity-&s;chool, without any other provi&s;ion than what he might be furni&s;hed with from time to time from the benevolence of well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, and without hav|ing any united with him in this concern, but &s;uch as were em|employed in the &s;ervice of the &s;chool; which experienced &s;uch a &s;eries of providential &s;upport, that he was enabled to carry on his generous de&s;ign thro' many difficulties and great di&s;tre&s;s without ob&s;truction, until he had laid the foundation of con&s;iderable build|ings, which he at length accompli&s;hed; and in the cour&s;e of a few years, it is related, that this &s;chool, which was begun with &s;o &s;lender a capital as 18<HI>&s;</HI>6 &s;terling, had upwards of 200 poor &s;cho|lars clothed, fed, and accommodated with good dwelling-places, be&s;ides receiving the nece&s;&s;ary &s;chool-learning, &amp;c. free of co&s;t: and this charity was continued, as he remarks,
<Q>without any &s;ettled provi&s;ion, and without any regard to human &s;upport, but reliance on Providence, and he did not &s;cruple to make daily additions to the number of their children; and thus the fir&s;t foundation of the &s;chool was laid: and he ob&s;erves, that he was led to engage in this de&s;ign without having premeditat|ed &s;uch a project, but thinks it was by a &s;ecret guidance of the Lord, that he was carried to the performance of &s;uch things as tended to an end he had not as yet conceived; and that the experience for &s;uch a work grew up with the work it&s;elf.</Q>
The many in&s;tances of unexpected relief which he met with in the pro&s;ecution of this laudable undertaking, as related in the account publi&s;hed re&s;pecting this &s;chool, were accompanied with &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances as will &s;carcely be received as credible in an age of &s;ceptici&s;m and unbelief: otherwi&s;e the recital of a few of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages might afford encouragement to tho&s;e who are engaged in &s;imilar designs, and be a &s;tronger confirmation of the &s;acred pages in what relates to a providential &s;upport, than &s;ome who are hedged <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are willing to believe.</NOTE> which might be made appear from numerous

<P>AS there are &s;ome who&s;e engagements will not permit them to enter minutely into an inquiry of this nature, &s;o as to form an adequate idea of the undertaking without &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for the advan|tage of the&s;e, and that they may be encouraged to unite in promoting &s;uch a plan, the following exami|nation into the propriety thereof is added, e&s;pecially as it may afford &s;ome u&s;eful information, and point out the nece&s;&s;ity of attention to this very weighty &s;ubject.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider that the youth among&s;t us need the &s;ame care that they do in Great-Britain, and that the &s;ame mea&s;ures are nece&s;&s;ary to be pur&s;ued to pro|mote their welfare here as there, and as we have the benefit of their experience to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the pro&s;ecution of our endeavours, it is an encourage|ment to the undertaking.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding there may be an apparent languor in &s;ome minds with re&s;pect to this moment|ous concern, yet when the ca&s;e of our young people is brought into view, and found to claim our &s;ym|pathy, as well as call for &s;ome relief, no doubt that it will be con&s;idered as a powerful motive to engage in &s;o beneficent a de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="022361_0035_0FB84888963EA038">And when we con&s;ider how many there are who are favored with abundant opportunities of in&s;tructi|on beyond what others have, and how &s;mall a part of the redundancy of that property which many are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, if brought together into one &s;um, would afford a fund which, under the management of a ju|dicious and well qualified committee of the Yearly Meeting, would lay the foundation of a &s;chool which might have all the advantages of that at Ackworth, with &s;uch others as the peculiar circum&s;tances of the youth in this highly favored country might make ne|ce&s;&s;ary, we cannot but &s;uppo&s;e that Friends might be brought to unite with, and &s;upport, a plan for &s;o valuable a purpo&s;e. And it &s;hould be remembered, as was ob&s;erved on the like occa&s;ion by John Fother|gill,
<Q>that it is not intended to burden any, for large contributions are not to be expected where there is but little to be &s;pared,</Q>
nor would it add a reputation to tho&s;e who have abundance, &s;hould they withhold the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Many advantages are expected to re&s;ult from this undertaking, that are not &s;o apparent on a &s;uperfici|al view as they would be found on a clo&s;er inquiry, both with re&s;pect to what relates to the temporal con|cerns of the young people, as well as their future well-being: be&s;ides as all things here below are in a &s;tate of mutability, we know not but that, whil&s;t we are providing for others, &s;ome of our particular de|&s;cendants may be benefited by &s;uch an in&s;titution, and

<P>The&s;e, with other important con&s;iderations which might be mentioned, &s;how that it is both &s;ea&s;onable and proper for this concern to re&s;t with weight upon Friends' minds; and it is hoped that what has been &s;aid will be &s;ufficient to prepare them for the inve&s;ti|gation of this &s;ubject free from tho&s;e bia&s;&s;es, which habits, with local or partial attachments, might cre|ate; neither regarding the objects of this benevo|lence, as they may be rich or poor, remote from us in their re&s;idence, or near; otherwi&s;e than as it may tend to their individual advantage and the benefit of &s;ociety in general: and after having the &s;ituation of many of our young people brought into their view, with other circum&s;tances, it is expected they would be enabled to form a clear judgment how far they might extend their pro&s;pects, &s;o as not to exceed the abilities of &s;ociety, nor yet forget the exten&s;ive be|nefits which &s;uch an in&s;titution would afford.</P>

<HEAD>A STATE OF THE YOUTH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. On an examination into the &s;ituation of the young people within the compa&s;s of this Yearly Meeting, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that many would be found, who, at an early period of their days, have been deprived of one or both their parents; perhaps left under the care of &s;trangers, or entru&s;ted
<PB N="39" REF="022361_0038_0FB84893A7387F30">
to guardians not in all re&s;pects qualified to &s;ympa|thize with them in their afflictive &s;ituations, nor di&s;|po&s;ed to extend that kind attention to their ca&s;es, which might in &s;ome degree compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of parental care and affection: and perhaps &s;ome of this number might not be &s;uitably provided for, as well as others who have parents, who, thro' various circum&s;tances, have been deprived of the means of providing a decent &s;upport for their tender offspring, and much le&s;s of ability to &s;chool and educate them properly. The&s;e with many other circum&s;tances open a field continually for the exerci&s;e of Chri&s;tian &s;ympathy and benevolence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there are many in affluent &s;ituations who are earne&s;tly de&s;irous that their children might have the benefit of a &s;elect and guarded education, at &s;uch an in&s;titution, under well qualified tutors, remote from the corrupt examples which are too prevalent in cities and common &s;chools; the&s;e would freely contribute of their &s;ub&s;tance, and they ought to be encouraged in the commendable di&s;po&s;ition, agree|able to the pious recommendation of Friends already expre&s;&s;ed, and to the &s;ounde&s;t maxims of prudence and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e other ca&s;es that would occur, where the di&s;po&s;ition of children of the &s;ame family, as well as other cau&s;es which might make it nece&s;&s;a|ry or u&s;eful to &s;eparate them for awhile one from

another; &s;ometimes to di&s;&s;olve unprofitable acquain|tances or unpromi&s;ing connexions, which otherwi&s;e might terminate to their di&s;advantage, if not eventu|ally to their ruin. That a large number of young people of both &s;exes would come under the&s;e de&s;crip|tions, in one or more in&s;tances, mu&s;t be allowed; as al&s;o others, who, from inclination, would prefer the opportunity which &s;uch an in&s;titution would af|ford, of being in&s;tructed under a well regulated &s;y&s;|tem with &s;ober Friends.</P>
<P>And yet it is with &s;atisfaction to be acknowledged, that many of our young people are &s;o peculiarly fa|vored as to have every accommodation nece&s;&s;ary to render their &s;ituations ea&s;y and agreeable; and &s;ome who have the additional advantage of well informed friends and relations, who&s;e pious conver&s;ation and exemplary conduct are the &s;ources of continual in|&s;truction and improvement; independent of the ad|vantages which &s;chooling may afford: but as this is not the ca&s;e generally, and there are others &s;o &s;ituat|ed as to need the care of Friends, it therefore be|hoves us, as members of one religious community, to afford that relief which their &s;everal ca&s;es may re|quire, which cannot be &s;o effectually done in any other way. The&s;e circum&s;tances, without bringing into view others which might be mentioned, which ari&s;e from weakne&s;s in parents and &s;orrowful declen|&s;ion in too many children, which cannot but be ob|vious, &s;how the propriety of an attention to this

weighty &s;ubject, and that &s;uch an in&s;titution as is now propo&s;ed, is wanting.</P>
<P N="2">II. That there has been a growing concern within the limits of this Yearly Meeting may be inferred from what has appeared for &s;ome years back, when a num|ber of per&s;ons of our profe&s;&s;ion have been engaged to promote &s;omething of this kind;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this was wrote it was intended to give &s;ome account of the &s;chool at Nottingham, in Che&s;ter county, with &s;ome other matters, in an appendix; but the length of this e&s;&s;ay has occa&s;i|oned their being laid a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent.</NOTE> and &s;ome &s;till continue to be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding they have been unprovided with a regular plan, &s;o fully matur|ed as to obtain the concurrence of the Yearly Meet|ing, to direct their proceedings by. Yet, under the&s;e di&s;advantages, con&s;iderable beque&s;ts have been made, and &s;ome donations added; as well as offers to a more con&s;iderable amount,
<Q>apparently proceeding (as our friend John Fothergill ob&s;erved with re|&s;pect to Ackworth &s;chool) from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the want of &s;ome &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment,</Q>
on an en|larged and liberal plan, &s;ubject to the directions of a committee of that Meeting.</P>
<P>And it is likewi&s;e hoped, that this concern will have more place, and be found to have increa&s;ing weight, on Friends' minds, when the nature of it is more clearly under&s;tood, and that &s;o beneficent an undertaking will be remembered by many, not only
<PB N="42" REF="022361_0041_0FB8475464230D88">
when they are making a final arrangement of their temporal affairs, but likewi&s;e at other &s;ea&s;ons, when they find that there is a probability that their chari|table intentions will be fulfilled, and any donations or beque&s;ts appropriated agreeable to their benevo|lent de&s;igns and Chri&s;tian duty, under the direction of &s;uch a committee.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been thought proper to recommend this concern to the attention of our women Friends, as it has been apprehended that they might not con&s;ider them&s;elves as equally bound with the men to promote it; but as it is intended for the benefit of both &s;exes, and they are favored with a portion of providential bounty, with &s;uitable qualifications to be u&s;eful, it is hoped they will at|tend to it, and, when called upon, afford that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which, in the wi&s;dom of truth, may be pointed out.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. With re&s;pect to the third propo&s;ition, that there is an ability in &s;ociety for &s;uch an undertaking, it may be ob&s;erved:</P>
<P>To effect any thing that will be exten&s;ively u&s;eful in this way, that will attract the attention of &s;ociety at large, or add a reputation to it, it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould have a plan of con&s;iderable magnitude in view; which cannot be attended with any inconveni|ences, if it is concluded afterwards to conduct it and carry it into execution on a &s;maller &s;cale, as it is much ea&s;ier to retrench a large one than it might be to enlarge a &s;mall one; and as it is not the intention of tho&s;e who have this &s;ubject mo&s;t at heart, to ex|ceed the abilities of &s;ociety, there can no di&s;ad|vantage ari&s;e from their having an exten&s;ive plan in
<PB N="43" REF="022361_0042_0FB84755E1696010">
view, but rather otherwi&s;e, as we are &s;ometimes en|couraged to engage in &s;maller difficulties by having large ones made familiar: and it may be remem|bered, that the plan of a &s;mall in&s;titution, ex|pre&s;&s;ed in all its parts in writing, will have the ap|pearance of &s;omething greater than it is intended to be; &s;o that I hope none will be harmed with &s;u&s;pici|ons that any thing burden&s;ome is intended, or what is incon&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;t and good of the ri&s;ing generation.</P>
<P>If too &s;mall a plan was propo&s;ed, it might tend to limit the views of &s;ome well-informed Friends, who may be favored with di&s;cernment to perceive what the abilities of the &s;ociety could perform, and the benevolence of wealthy individuals di&s;po&s;ed to ac|compli&s;h, when united with others le&s;s able; and might by this means prevent its becoming &s;o exten|&s;ively u&s;eful as it otherwi&s;e would; as well as di&s;cou|rage tho&s;e who may come after us, with more expe|rience, and perhaps with more ability, from im|proving upon our labors to advantage: for which rea&s;ons I have thought it be&s;t not to be too contract|ed in my pro&s;pects, le&s;t we might lo&s;e the benefits ari&s;ing from a proper education, for want of &s;uitable exertions.</P>
<P>When we are con&s;idered but as in&s;truments in the Divine Hand, and that he can di&s;po&s;e the hearts of men, beyond what human rea&s;on might &s;ugge&s;t, to fa|vor
<PB N="44" REF="022361_0043_0FB84757F850BB98">
&s;uch an undertaking, and with &s;o much liberality as rather to excite our admiration than di&s;appoint our wi&s;hes, it has rai&s;ed &s;ome degree of confidence that this undertaking will not be left unaccompli&s;h|ed, nor fail to an&s;wer the valuable purpo&s;es expected from it; and I have been &s;trengthened in this per|&s;ua&s;ion, when I have remembered the manner in which the &s;chools under the direction of Friends in this city originated, and how their funds have in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;chools were fir&s;t &s;et on foot by a &s;ingle Monthly Meeting, and were liberally provided for when our numbers were comparatively few to what they are at this time, nor were they near &s;o wealthy, be&s;ides having difficulties to contend with, in the early periods of this &s;ettlement, which we are &s;tran|gers to at this day.</P>
<P>Afterwards they were principally endowed and provided for by a few per&s;ons who had the &s;ub|ject weightily on their minds, who left property &s;uf|ficient to form a fund, which has been adequate to the &s;upport of &s;chools for the poor of the Monthly Meeting, be&s;ides many others, the offspring of per|&s;ons belonging to other religious &s;ocieties. The over&s;eers of the&s;e &s;chools have been able to allow &s;a|laries, and grant encouragement, in divers ways, to well-qualified tutors; and at this time their fund is quite &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es
<PB N="45" REF="022361_0044_0FB84759F9347090">
of keeping them up, and fully equal to what is nece&s;&s;ary to begin an e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;uch as is now propo&s;ed for the whole &s;ociety to undertake.</P>
<P>And this can only be con&s;idered as a private fund, accumulated within the limits of one Monthly Meet|ing,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since divided into three.</NOTE> and the re&s;ult of a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition in only a few individuals, principally effected above half a century ago: &s;o that the pre&s;ent generation has had no &s;hare in forming it; but have derived con&s;iderable benefits from this fund: hence there &s;eems to be an obligation on the pre&s;ent generation of Friends to make the like provi&s;ion for tho&s;e who are to &s;ucceed them, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Many young people, who are in a way to have increa&s;ing fa|milies, are apt to be inattentive to concerns of this nature, and to the important con&s;equences which re&s;ult from a right education; I have wi&s;hed that they might remember, that unle&s;s &s;uitable &s;chools are begun to be e&s;tabli&s;hed before they want them, their offspring cannot be benefited by them when they do; and it has been my de&s;ire that they may not neglect an early attention to the right education of their offspring, nor be indifferent with re&s;pect to the making provi&s;ion for &s;uitable &s;chools, according to their circum|&s;tances, le&s;t they &s;hould experience the nece&s;&s;ity for them when too late to be remedied, and have to lament their inattention, in con&s;equence of the depravity or ill conduct of their children; which has been the &s;orrowful experience of many.</NOTE> as well as for the pre&s;ent: indeed &s;uch is the nature of in&s;titutions of this kind, that they not only &s;erve tho&s;e who may be living at the time of their e&s;tabli&s;hment, but likewi&s;e have a more re|mote effect; and by an attention to &s;uch u&s;eful un|dertakings, we may confer a benefit upon many ge|nerations, who are to &s;ucceed us, which is a very
<PB N="46" REF="022361_0045_0FB8475BCC785648">
encouraging circum&s;tance to tho&s;e who may be en|gaged to promote them.</P>
<P>There is another in&s;tance in a &s;chool under the care of Friends of this city, for the in&s;truction of the blacks: where unexpected provi&s;ion has been made, by unfore&s;een ways, of a &s;ufficient fund to &s;upport it, in the cour&s;e of a few years, and tho&s;e who had the fir&s;t burden, were exonerated &s;ooner than was look|ed for. At pre&s;ent they have an annual income of about &pound;. 200, ari&s;ing from ground-rents, &amp;c. &s;o con|&s;olidated that there is a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect that it will afford a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment to this generous un|dertaking; which, it is &s;aid, originated with the wo|men of our religious &s;ociety in this city.</P>
<P>If &s;uch in&s;titutions as the&s;e have been begun and &s;upported within the limits, and by the benevolence of Friends mo&s;tly within, this city, what may we not hope from the united endeavours of the whole &s;ociety? to infer an inability in them to make a con|&s;iderable e&s;tabli&s;hment, and provide for the &s;chool|ing, accommodation, and &s;upport of a number of tho&s;e who need it, and have a religious claim upon them for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would be contrary to the pro&s;pect of &s;uch Friends as have con&s;idered the &s;ubject in a &s;olid, weighty manner; and if the number of fami|lies which con&s;titute this Yearly Meeting, was known, it could be made appear: but as this is uncertain, any calculations founded on our numbers mu&s;t be

<P>And as we may rea&s;onably conclude that a con&s;i|derable &s;um would be generou&s;ly given for this pur|po&s;e by wealthy individuals, we might hope that a fund would be gradually formed &s;o as to relieve the apprehen&s;ions of its being attended with any con&s;i|derable expen&s;e; and that donations and beque&s;ts would be made, un&s;olicited, at times, to enable Friends to erect many of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive and ne|ce&s;&s;ary buildings: &s;o that when we compare the bene|fits which may be expected from &s;uch an in&s;titution with the expen&s;e likely to attend it; and con&s;ider the foundation there is to believe that many wealthy indi|viduals, as well as others, will be di&s;po&s;ed to favor &s;o u&s;eful a de&s;ign; and reflect upon what has been done by a part of the &s;ociety; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Within the limits of Philadelphia Monthly Meetings.</NOTE> we need not he&s;itate to conclude that there is &s;ufficient ABILITY for &s;uch an undertaking.</P>
<P N="4">IV. And that it would be attended with many ad|vantages not to be had in any other way, may be de|duced from the following con&s;iderations, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="022361_0047_0FB8475E69CF8D60">Among&s;t other circum&s;tances which might be men|tioned, the excellent regulations introduced into the &s;chool at ACKWORTH, and the manner in which that in&s;titution has been conducted, with the experience which has been &s;ince had of the beneficial effects of tho&s;e regulations on the manners and deportment of the youth brought up at that place, affords a plea&s;|ing pro&s;pect that a &s;y&s;tem of oeconomy and manage|ment is practicable at a large in&s;titution, which may be productive of many advantages not to be obtained at &s;maller &s;chools, particularly &s;o as to reduce the co&s;t of board and &s;chooling, which are circum&s;tances wor|thy of regard in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools.</P>
<P>Nor is it unlikely, as was ob&s;erved re&s;pecting Ack|worth &s;chool,
<Q>that one on a large plan would fix the attention, and excite the bounty, of Friends, whil&s;t tho&s;e upon a &s;maller &s;cale would be over|looked, and &s;oon di&s;appear,</Q>
as was found to be the ca&s;e in Great-Britain; be&s;ides, it might be expected that this in&s;titution would draw forth from a &s;tate of le&s;s activity, men and women, who may have been rai&s;ed up and &s;uitably qualified for every &s;tation which &s;o large an undertaking would require, however arduous, who might be willing to engage in any line of duty to which they might be called, from an enlarged pro&s;pect of u&s;efulne&s;s, and a de&s;ire that their labors may be ble&s;&s;ed to the be|nefit of the young and ri&s;ing generation; as has been the ca&s;e at that valuable in&s;titution at Ackworth: nor
<PB N="49" REF="022361_0048_0FB8475FE4A2BD08">
is there any doubt in my mind, but &s;uch are now among&s;t us, unnoticed and in a &s;tate of greater ob|&s;curity.</P>
<P>Another evident advantage which mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment is, that a number of young people of both &s;exes would be forming from time to time, under the excellent regulations which are ex|pected to be introduced at &s;uch an in&s;titution, who Would be likely to come forward with all the advan|tages which could be obtained from a well regulated cour&s;e of in&s;truction, to engage as ma&s;ters and mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es at tho&s;e &s;chools which are recommended to be e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout the &s;ociety by the Yearly Meeting, and thereby advance what that Meeting have had in view,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As expre&s;&s;ed in the extracts from their minutes lately &s;pread thro' the &s;ociety under the direction of our Meeting for Suffer|ings.</NOTE> by removing a principal di&s;cou|ragement to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch &s;chools, that is, <HI>the want of &s;uitable per&s;ons for teachers.</HI></P>
<P>There are other circum&s;tances which might ren|der &s;uch an in&s;titution u&s;eful above any other which could be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a more contracted &s;cale, viz. it might be laying the foundation for greater im|provement in the &s;y&s;tem of in&s;truction to be pur&s;ued for the benefit of the youth at &s;uch a place; likewi&s;e in the manner of bringing them up, that there
<PB N="50" REF="022361_0049_0FB8476225C8BEA8">
might be a greater conformity to what has been invariably recommended by Friends from the fir&s;t ri&s;e of the &s;ociety, as the only probable means, of deriving to our offspring tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial be|nefits which have been uniformly experienced to flow from an attention to their advice, in additi|on to tho&s;e u&s;eful qualifications which would ari&s;e from &s;o judicious a cour&s;e of &s;chool-learning, and it is likely that the example afforded at this &s;chool would be followed by others; hence, its influence on the manners and conduct of the youth might extend to remote &s;eminaries: whereby Friends would be in|&s;trumental in promoting the happine&s;s and improve|ment of many young people, who might otherwi&s;e remain in a le&s;s cultivated and le&s;s happy &s;tate; nor could &s;uch an in&s;titution, properly conducted, fail of adding a reputation to the <HI>&s;ociety,</HI> and perhaps have a tendency to diffu&s;e the principles of LIGHT and TRUTH which we profe&s;s; by awakening a &s;pirit of inquiry after them, among&s;t other people.</P>
<P>Another advantage which would re&s;ult from this undertaking, and &s;eems worthy of notice is, that by engaging in this laudable de&s;ign, it might excite a greater di&s;po&s;ition to attend to the religious in&s;tructi|on of the young people, in &s;ome who have been too inattentive to this important concern; who might be brought, by giving up to it, to become more zea|lou&s;ly engaged to encourage other &s;chools, agreeable to what has been recommended by Friends: for it 
<PB N="51" REF="022361_0050_0FB84763DAD61E00">has been con&s;idered as an approved maxim,
<Q>the more any per&s;on gives towards <HI>charitable</HI> in&s;titu|tions,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Although this in&s;titution is not intended for the u&s;e of tho&s;e young people <HI>only</HI> who are not in affluent circum&s;tances, never|thele&s;s it may, according to the nice&s;t con&s;truction of the inten|tion, be con&s;idered as a charitable de&s;ign; for there is no way in which we can &s;o effectually relieve difficulties, as by &s;uitable endeavours to prevent them: nor can a better &s;y&s;tem of oeconomy be adopted by a &s;ociety in extending alms, than by providing for the proper education and in&s;truction of the young people who may have occa&s;ion for &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance. How great have been the difficulties which &s;ome have been involved in for want of this care? what irretrievable evils do many unguardedly plunge into for want of early in&s;truction? and what misfortunes have en&s;ued, &s;o as to produce a &s;eries of fatal con&s;equences which have excited a painful recollection? merely thro' the neglect of an early care for that purpo&s;e, and perhaps I might not improperly add, for want of more liberality and nece&s;&s;ary attention to &s;uch u&s;eful &s;chools.</NOTE> the more willing he becomes to give to|wards the encouragement of <HI>others,</HI></Q>
e&s;pecially when it is for the like benevolent purpo&s;es; we might therefore conclude that it would have a tendency to promote a greater degree of liberality with a better di&s;po&s;ition to &s;upport le&s;&s;er &s;chools on the &s;y&s;tem, and for the valuable purpo&s;es recommended by the Year|ly Meeting.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances ought to afford us grounds to believe, that &s;uch an in&s;titution will be attended with advantages which cannot be had in any other way.</P>
<P>Being confirmed in this opinion, and that &s;uch a &s;chool, &s;omewhere in the country, in a healthy &s;itu|ation, free from the objections which have been
<PB N="52" REF="022361_0051_0FB84766C347F358">
mentioned, and on a large e&s;tabli&s;hment, will have many advantages which cannot be obtained either in town or country. I have, therefore, engaged in this e&s;&s;ay, with an expectation that Friends will be favored to judge of the propriety of the concern, and that in due &s;ea&s;on it will claim their &s;olid atten|tion, obtain &s;uitable encouragement, and be the means, under Divine Providence, of many of our young people, who may be left in an unprovided condition, as well as others, being &s;uitably taken care of, in&s;tructed, and prepared to enter upon the du|ties of life, with every advantage which a well di|rected education can afford: which is the de&s;ire of their friend and well-wi&s;her in the truth,</P>
