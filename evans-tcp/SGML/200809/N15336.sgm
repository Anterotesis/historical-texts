<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>TRUTH</HI> is a Pearl of intrin&s;ic Value. Every Brea&s;t admitting it becomes its welcome Habita|tion. It refu&s;es not to dwell with Beggars, Kings, or any Cla&s;s of Men, who receive it; and may accompany a Malefactor, a joyful Companion to the Gallows; and from &s;urrounding Spectators of his Infamy and Death, rai&s;e him to meet the Plaudit of the general A&s;&s;embly, and a welcome Life eternal. It may be compared to a cha&s;te Virgin, of heavenly Birth, and immortal Charms, upon who&s;e Forehead is deep engraved, <HI>The Wrath of God is revealed again&s;t all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of Men,</HI> yet &s;till wears an inviting A&s;pect to all Sorts of Men, while pointing out how that Wrath has been &s;atisfied for Men of every Character. She patiently bears In&s;ults and Reproaches, but &s;till is jealous of her own Honour, and that of her Family, and cannot admit the intruding Hands of Ruffians. Her ju&s;t Re&s;entment ri&s;es again&s;t it, denouncing the Vengeance of Heaven. She &s;corns all cringing and fawning. In &s;incere Friend|&s;hip, &s;he levels &s;harp-pointed Arrows at the Con&s;cience, to wound deeply, but not without the kind Purpo&s;e of conveying a &s;alutary Bal&s;am.</P>
<P>Whether the Lineaments of her Features, attempted in the following Pages, be copied after tho&s;e already drawn by the Finger of God in the &s;acred Pages, is not left to the Deci&s;ion of unconcerned Spectators, who do not find them&s;elves deeply intere&s;ted, nor tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e Gain is Godline&s;s&mdash;nor tho&s;e who contend for Victory, but is &s;ubmitted to the Judgement of tho&s;e to who&s;e Con|&s;cience the Truth commends it&s;elf in the Sight of God. And if any Thing be found not conformable to the Faith once delivered to the Saints, let it be rejected, and meet with de&s;erved Contempt.</P>

<HEAD>CAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A conci&s;e View of the Doctrine&mdash;Men generally uncer|tain where to look for Truth&mdash;fal&s;e Direction given the Mind by its Wi&s;h&mdash;by Parents&mdash;Teachers&mdash;the Public&mdash;the Great&mdash;ancient Fathers, &amp;c.&mdash;An in|fallible Standard of Truth&mdash;Unity and Force of Scripture&mdash;its Effects&mdash;its open Way of Speaking, and what U&s;e made of it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>UNIVERSAL Salvation is a doctrine which would make every heart leap for joy that could fully believe it; and there is no man living without a natural reli&s;h for that perfect &s;ecurity about the next world, which a belief of it would in&s;pire. If it were po&s;&s;ible to manufacture truth and evidence, would not every per&s;on be employed in making a doctrine true, which to all intents involves his own per&s;onal happine&s;s beyond the grave? This doctrine is held to be clo&s;ely connected with that grand arti|cle of the chri&s;tian faith, the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s. It gives trouble to many to find all their claims upon their Maker, in preference to other men, boldly &s;et at nought by the advocates of this doctrine; and to &s;ee them&s;elves placed in the &s;ame point of light with dying criminals, and to find that no righteou&s;ne&s;s is made account of but that of one per&s;on only, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And all the &s;triking things they &s;ay, about the grandeur of his character, lo&s;e their lu&s;tre with them, becau&s;e they think them &s;aid to &s;uper&s;ede their own worth.</P>
<P>Far be it from us to object to the compleat and entire &s;ufficiency of that righteou&s;ne&s;s, for all tho&s;e whom it re&s;pected; and may they be covered with &s;hame who object to it! And if &s;uch was the high will of Him who can do what he will with his own
<PB N="6" REF="019452_0005_0FABA486E87ECA70">
that this righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould re&s;pect every one of the human race, then let no man move his tongue again&s;t this doctrine. However, when this is round|ly a&s;&s;erted, and con&s;equently that all will be &s;aved, however de&s;irable it would be to join, the mind re|coils, as from a dangerous leap, and whi&s;pers that this is extending beyond the limits which God has &s;et, and doing violence to the divine te&s;timony. And it is difficult to conceive, that the advocates for this doctrine are at all times free from a faulter|ing mind. Whether this &s;hrinking from what the mind would fain gra&s;p &s;hould be attributed to deceit may &s;oon appear.</P>
<P>It is well known that many men are in &s;uch doubt|fulne&s;s and confu&s;ion about what is truth, that they know not where to look for an infallible conductor, to guide them in determining about any point of doctrine advanced. It is not a&s;ide from the pre&s;ent de&s;ign to point out both fal&s;e guides, which often mi&s;lead, and an infallible &s;tandard of truth al&s;o, which may be firmly relied on in man's la&s;t extremity.&mdash; A man's faith often ri&s;es not from real evidence but deceitful influence, both in things of this life, and another. A belief of his future pro&s;perity in this world, and of a long life, frequently turns out in fact to be a fal&s;e belief. Something foreign from genuine evidence influenced to it. The wi&s;h of his heart was chiefly concerned. The &s;ame leads many to believe and proclaim their own integrity, when their neighbours cannot believe it. It leads oppo&s;ite contending parties to believe they are right in many ca&s;es, whereas a by-&s;tander may &s;ee that &s;elf-intere&s;t &s;ways their belief. So the wi&s;h and inclination may be deeply concerned in leading a man to believe tho&s;e doctrines of religion, which will make his &s;itu|ation ea&s;y in &s;ociety here, and flatter him with a cer|tain pro&s;pect of happine&s;s hereafter. A belief ri&s;ing from the wi&s;h can make nothing true; and as it
<PB N="7" REF="019452_0006_0FABA487A0855528">
often proves fal&s;e in this world, &s;o it may in the next, into which we cannot at pre&s;ent look.</P>
<P>As a man receives a turn to error from his own heart, &s;o he often does from his connexions in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The tye between parents and children is great; and the little ones early look to them as guides al|mo&s;t infallible in all matters; and their belief and practice is &s;haped after them. They grow up with their parents manners, and with their parents reli|gion. The innumerable contradicting &s;ects of this pre&s;ent generation had their birth from the &s;ame &s;ects of the la&s;t, who formed their children in a belief of what they them&s;elves believed; and the children drew in their &s;entiments as they drew milk from the brea&s;t, without a &s;tronger argument than this, it is true, be|cau&s;e their parents &s;ay &s;o. This argument has al|mo&s;t equal &s;way among Pagans, Mahometans, Pa|pi&s;ts, and Prote&s;tants; and its influence has run through all ages. The Chri&s;tians deliverance from it is pointed out 1 Pet. i. 18, 19. 'Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, &s;ilver and gold&mdash; from your vain conver&s;ation, received by tradition from your fathers.'</P>
<P>Public teachers often mi&s;lead men in their belief. This will readily be admitted as to Pagan and Popi&s;h prie&s;ts; but when one looks nearer home, the eye is beclouded. The&s;e teachers grow out of every &s;ect as their proper &s;oil, and probably no &s;ect will be de&s;titute as long as they hold up &s;ufficient rewards. Tho&s;e who have money to hire &s;eldom want for la|bourers. Such veneration for them as men of God, is often &s;o impre&s;&s;ed in childhood, as never to be &s;haken off by many even in the late&s;t period of life. How well placed the tru&s;t every where put in them is, might be &s;trikingly manife&s;ted by a hi&s;tory of them in all parts of the globe, not only among Pagans, but even tho&s;e called Chri&s;tians. Nay, one need not look far to &s;ee how many oppo&s;ite winds of doctrine
<PB N="8" REF="019452_0007_0FABA4885E093D50">
i&s;&s;ue from their mouths; and in how many oppo&s;ite paths they &s;everally conduct their admirers.</P>
<P>The opinion of the public where one happens to live, often mi&s;leads men. They naturally fall in with that which is connected with the e&s;teem of their neighbours; and be&s;ides, the opinion of many &s;eems to give a &s;anction to one's own opinion, and make it appear &s;omehow &s;acred. This brings to mind the proverb. <HI>Vox populi, vox Dei.</HI> The voice of the people is the voice of God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this proverb be true, the God of whom it is &s;poken changes as much as the Camelion, and a&s;&s;umes as many &s;hapes as Proteus.</NOTE>. A man feels &s;trong when multitudes are of his &s;ide in opinion, and if he departs from them he is apt to feel weak, and to be da&s;hed out of countenance. It is no hard thing to prove the multitude generally upon the &s;ide of fal&s;|hood. A man travelling round the globe, will find public opinion changing, more than the climates he pa&s;&s;es through. The in&s;pired language is, 'Thou &s;halt not follow a multitude to do evil.&mdash;Though hand join hand, the wicked &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed.'</P>
<P>Some confide in ancient fathers, who lived near the apo&s;tles, and are mi&s;led that way. The cor|ruption of the go&s;pel began even in their days, and grew continually after, till that man of &s;in was re|vealed, the &s;on of perdition, who&s;e coming was after the working of &s;atan: 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 3&mdash;13. This prophecy has been verified by the event. The&s;e fathers were more and more employed in modelling the go&s;pel, to &s;hape with the religion of the nations; adding Pagan maxims, traditions, &amp;c. In &s;hort, they carried their point, and got Chri&s;tianity grafted upon Pagani&s;m, and it partook of its root and &s;ap, and bore its fruit; as it has ever &s;ince remained, even unto this day. The&s;e fathers were oppo&s;ed to each other, and each one was orthodox to him&s;elf and he|terodox to his oppo&s;er. Who &s;hall tell us which of
<PB N="9" REF="019452_0008_0FABA489315E7D20">
them was right? parents, teachers, or the public, or who? As to getting any a&s;&s;urance from them of what is indeed truth, we may as well let their volumes lie piled together in du&s;t, as expect to find it by earne&s;tly turning them over in peru&s;al.</P>
<P>Some lay &s;tre&s;s upon, and are mi&s;led by great men. But &s;hould princes, &s;tate&s;men, generals, phi|lo&s;ophers, and divines, &s;o called, be con&s;ulted about truth, there is no more agreement among them than among the unlearned and ignorant; a proof beyond contradiction, that though they may be &s;kilful guides in matters of this life, there is not the lea&s;t depend|ance upon them in the concerns of another. And thus it is written, 'I will de&s;troy the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, and bring to nothing the under&s;tanding of the prudent.' 1 Cor. i. 19.</P>
<P>By &s;uch fallacious guides are men led in all parts of the world; and a per&s;on looking beyond his own &s;ect pronounces all the re&s;t infatuated. But when he views his own &s;ect concerned, the argument returns with its whole force; and if &s;tripped of the opinion of his own parent, teacher, party, &amp;c. he feels as if robbed of every dependance in religion; which &s;hews him to be of the &s;ame &s;tamp, and equally in|fatuated with all the re&s;t. It may then be &s;aid, the&s;e dependancies are deceitful, and they may be all di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed together, proclaiming their own fallacy in the ear of con&s;cience. It may be added, that &s;ome men, &s;en&s;ible of the general infatuation, have di&s;&s;ented from their neighbours, and rai&s;ed a cry for human rea&s;on; but as they differ, and are oppo&s;ed in &s;enti|ment, it may be concluded that they are no le&s;s con|ducted by deceit than the re&s;t. And as it is written, 'lean not to thine own under&s;tanding&mdash;he that tru&s;t|eth to his own heart is a fool,' our ears may well be &s;hut to the cry.</P>
<P>Is man then left without any re&s;ort? Is there no &s;afe conductor to take him by the hand, and direct him &s;afely in that which is of the highe&s;t con&s;e|quence?
<PB N="10" REF="019452_0009_0FABA489F5A7AC08">
Do any wi&s;h to hold conference with their departed relatives; or to con&s;ult with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, upon doubtful matters? Or to hear the voice of God from heaven? They may imagine this would give a quick deci&s;ion to every doubtful point<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When &s;uch intercour&s;e was held, men had doubts, and it was painful, as both the hi&s;tory of I&s;rael and the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us on the earth &s;hew.</NOTE>. But we are not de&s;titute of them. Their &s;ound hath gone into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world, and have come nigh to us in their journey; &s;o that one may con&s;ult Je&s;us, and his Apo&s;tles, with freedom; and enquire of the &s;upreme God, &s;peaking by them, and by the pro|phets. Let it not be vainly imagined, that there is a deficiency in the oracles of God. Their compleat|ne&s;s is thus expre&s;&s;ed, 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17. 'All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is pro|fitable for doctrine, &amp;c. that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works.' Could full credit be given to the&s;e words, one would not need further atte&s;tation to prove them compleat. They were intended as a compleat ex|pre&s;&s;ion of God's mind to man. He framed the un|der&s;tandings of men in all their variety, and well knows in what words his meaning will be be&s;t under|&s;tood, and what manner of addre&s;s is be&s;t &s;uited to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e. To &s;ay they are not a compleat addre&s;s to the con&s;cience of all &s;orts of men mu&s;t be a high reflection upon their author. With what darkne&s;s, and incon&s;i&s;tency, do little emmets of a day, venture to charge the words of the living God. In attempting to explain his words, they accommo|date them to their own lu&s;ts, or &s;ome pre-conceived opinion; they put their confu&s;ed, incon&s;i&s;tent ideas as part of divine truth; and then charge all their own darkne&s;s to the &s;criptures, wiping them&s;elves clean. They &s;peak not without a &s;ignificant mean|ing,
<PB N="11" REF="019452_0010_0FABA48A9DF937C0">
nor &s;o ab&s;tru&s;ely as to be under&s;tood by the learned only; for wayfaring men, though fools, may under&s;tand them, without the aid of Jewi&s;h or Chri&s;tian doctors. This was fact at fir&s;t, that fi&s;her|men came at the &s;imple meaning, which haughty doctors overlooked and de&s;pi&s;ed, and it may be fact &s;till. God &s;peaks not here words of uncertain &s;ig|nification, which may mean a thing or its oppo&s;ite, as is reported of Pagan oracles, and is true of many religious doctors. It is &s;aid, 1 Cor. xiv. 7, 8.&mdash; 'Even things without life giving &s;ound, except they give a di&s;tinction in the &s;ounds, how &s;hall it be known what is piped or harped? For if the trum|pet give an uncertain &s;ound, who &s;hall prepare him|&s;elf to the battle.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">If &s;cripture be compared to a pipe or harp, are its founds not di&s;tingui&s;hed? or if to a trumpet doth it give an uncertain &s;ound?</NOTE> The Apo&s;tle in this chapter pre|fers five words &s;poken plain to the under&s;tanding be|fore ten thou&s;and otherwi&s;e. This nece&s;&s;arily im|plies, that &s;cripture it&s;elf &s;peaks plain to the under|&s;tanding. To &s;uppo&s;e one part of the &s;criptures is de|&s;troyed or weakened by what is &s;aid in another, im|plies a high charge again&s;t their author. In&s;tead of this one part &s;upports and &s;trengthens another, form|ing an harmonious con&s;i&s;tency. And if any cre|dit be given to their te&s;timony about them&s;elves, they are able without human aid to make wi&s;e to &s;alvation, 2 Tim. iii. 15. This is the utmo&s;t that can be craved.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Some apprehend danger of peri&s;hing for lack of vi&s;ion, if they have no clergyman to preach among them. To &s;uch the preaching of the Apo&s;tles recorded in the Bible is an in&s;ipid tale. But by this, fooli&s;h as it may &s;eem, God &s;aves them that believe.</NOTE> 'They are able to build up and give an inheritance among the &s;anctified.' Acts xx. 32. 'They, like the rain &s;ent down which waters the earth and cau&s;es it to bring forth for man's &s;u&s;te|nance, return not void, but accompli&s;h all that God plea&s;es.' I&s;a. lv. 10, 11.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="019452_0011_0FABA48B60C17F80">Many think they &s;hould be happy could they &s;ee the Lord, and enquire at his mouth. But when men had this opportunity, their complaint was the &s;ame that it is now about the &s;criptures; 'How long do&s;t thou make us to doubt; tell us plainly.' John x. 24. And if Je&s;us was now to be &s;poken with, what would a&s;king further information imply, but that there was a fault in tho&s;e in&s;tructions which he had already determined to be fully compleat? And would it not have the appearance of pre&s;ump|tion? Should a nobleman expre&s;s his thoughts to his &s;ervants, knowing them &s;ufficiently plain for their under&s;tandings, and leave them in writing for their peru&s;al, what would running to him for further in|&s;tructions imply, but that tho&s;e already given were in&s;ufficient, and he who gave them to blame.</P>
<P>That there is a perfect agreement of the &s;cripture te&s;timony in all its parts, is &s;trikingly manife&s;t, by the genuine effect of it, upon the real believers of it at fir&s;t, which corre&s;ponded like the impre&s;&s;ion to the &s;eal. See Acts iv. 32. 'And the multitude of them who believed were of one heart, and of one &s;oul.' Acts ii. 1. 'They were all with one accord in one place.' 46. v. 'And they continuing daily with one accord in the temple.' v. 12. 'And they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.'<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">We are led to think of a mu&s;ical in&s;trument, who&s;e &s;trings are in perfect concord.</NOTE> 1 Cor. i. 10. 'Now I be&s;eech you brethren, that ye be per|fectly joined together, in the &s;ame mind and the &s;ame judgement.' Rom. xv. 6. 'That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, &amp;c.' <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">The meaning of here&s;y was then a breach of this onene&s;s of &s;entiment, but now it is what men plea&s;e to call it.</NOTE> Any thing that ro&s;e oppo&s;ite to this was cru&s;hed in the birth. A church is compared to the human body, which made up of &s;everal members is yet one, and each member has a fellow feeling with the re&s;t. See 1 Cor. xii. Of this union mo&s;t who are called
<PB N="13" REF="019452_0012_0FABA48C2387DEF8">
churches now have not a di&s;tant idea. And &s;tudents in divinity may be ever learning and never be able to come to the knowledge of this truth. But leaving them at their &s;tudies, it may be boldly affirmed, that the union of the fir&s;t churches in the truth, and love for its &s;ake, was &s;uch, that the force of men and de|vils combined could not break it; and many loved not their lives to the death. The certain cau&s;e of this unity of belief was the unity of the words of Je&s;us and his Apo&s;tles, which produced this unity among believers as its corre&s;ponding effect. The &s;ame words are now recorded in the &s;criptures, a certain proof this, that there is a perfect unity of &s;en|timent, in tho&s;e &s;criptures which men ra&s;hly charge with incon&s;i&s;tency and contradiction.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of &s;cripture appeared forcible al&s;o by its effect. The go&s;pel came to them not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Gho&s;t, and in much a&s;&s;urance; cau&s;ing joy in much affliction, and turned men from idols to &s;erve the living God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, 1 The&s;&s;. i. See al&s;o 2 Cor. x. 4, 5. 'The weapons of our warfare are mighty, through God, to the pulling down of &s;trong holds, ca&s;ting down imaginations, and every high thing, that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of God; and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chri&s;t.' Here we naturally think of artillery rai&s;ed again&s;t a &s;trong fortre&s;s, le|velling it all to the ground, effecting a mo&s;t com|pleat conque&s;t. Again read Heb. iv. 12. 'The word of God is quick and powerful, and &s;harper than any two-edged &s;word, piercing to the dividing a&s;under of &s;oul, and &s;pirit, and of the joints and marrow, &amp;c.' What words can more pungently ex|pre&s;s its &s;harp penetrating force. The effect upon Paul, the murderers of Je&s;us, the Ephe&s;ians, and indeed all, appeared fully to an&s;wer the&s;e de&s;criptions of its force. Je&s;us &s;aith, John v. 25. 'The hour is coming and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the

voice of the Son of God, and they that hear &s;hall live.' Its force upon living men is here repre&s;ented the &s;ame that it will be hereafter upon the &s;leeping du&s;t. However feeble the &s;criptures now appear, as their Lord once did, yet hereafter they will be known to be the &s;ame powerful voice which &s;aid at fir&s;t, Let there be light, and at la&s;t will command life in|to tho&s;e in their graves; and that their effect upon every believer of them di&s;covered the &s;ame power, Eph. i. 19, 20, and ii. 5. The&s;e &s;criptures are re|pre&s;ented as judging men at the la&s;t day. John xii. 48, 'Then tho&s;e who have hurt the two witne&s;&s;es, the old and new te&s;tament, mu&s;t be killed after this manner, by fire i&s;&s;uing out of their mouth.' At their clo&s;e we have the judgement of tho&s;e that add to, or take from their te&s;timony. Rev. xxii. 18, 19. Where is the complaint now that there is no where to look for truth?</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to the deci&s;ive te&s;timony of &s;cripture in this matter, a fact or two may be mentioned, which appears in oppo&s;ition to this doc|trine. That the contrary doctrine is generally profe&s;&s;ed at this day is fact as their formulas &s;hew; and hi&s;tory &s;hews it to have been &s;o from early ages. This be|ing granted, it may be ob&s;erved, that had the Apo&s;|tles indeed held the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation, it appears impo&s;&s;ible that the contrary doctrine &s;hould have &s;uch a &s;pread in the world; becau&s;e this doctrine is &s;o agreeable to the ta&s;te of all men, that no period can be found between the Apo&s;tles days and the pre&s;ent, when they would have parted with it. Had any per&s;on attempted to lead them to it, all profe&s;&s;ors would have ri&s;en up again&s;t him, as attempting to rob them of the riche&s;t jewel in their cabinet, their highe&s;t &s;ecurity for another world. Let it al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that Chri&s;tianity was early made a tool of &s;tate by Con&s;tantine, which manife&s;ts that profe&s;&s;ors then held to a future pu|ni&s;hment;

for rulers judge it nece&s;&s;ary to hold up terrors of religion beyond this life, to enforce obe|dience from their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>But not to enlarge here, the proper appeal is to the holy &s;criptures, the living oracles of God; and it mu&s;t appear to every per&s;on not under the entire in|fluence of the fir&s;t rea&s;oner again&s;t, and &s;oftner of the rigour of the divine threatning, who early &s;aid, 'Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die;' that the &s;criptures do &s;et|tle this point, that &s;ome men will &s;uffer puni&s;hment beyond the grave, as fully as words can expre&s;s. This is &s;trongly implied and expre&s;&s;ed various ways.</P>
<P>The appellations given to all that &s;hall be &s;aved collectively &s;hew that they are only a part of man|kind. The word (EKKLESIA) Church, &s;ignifies a body of men called out from among&s;t others; the word (EKLEKTOI) Elect, &s;ignifies men cho&s;en out from among others. And the whole &s;cripture ac|count &s;hews them to be per&s;ons called, and cho&s;en out of the world, as the&s;e names import. Noah's family in the old world, and Lot's in Sodom, were types of them. The Patriarchs, the Jews, and the Chri&s;tians, were kept di&s;tinct as being called out of the world. The di&s;tinction of the Jews from the re&s;t of mankind is pointed out, Lev. xx. 26. 'Ye &s;hall be holy unto me, for I the Lord am holy, and have <HI>&s;evered</HI> you from other people, that ye &s;hould be mine.' Deut. vii. 6. 'The Lord thy God hath cho&s;en thee, to be a &s;pecial people unto him&s;elf, above all people upon the face of the earth.' They were allowed no connexion in religion with other nations. If they mingled with them, learned their works, intermarried, went after their gods, or tru&s;ted in their princes, they were viewed as deeply guilty. The leaders informed Ezra, that the Le|vites had not &s;eparated them&s;elves from the nations, but the holy &s;eed had mingled them&s;elves with other people in marriage: Upon which he rent his gar|ment, plucked off his hair, and &s;at down a&s;toni&s;hed;

and then fell upon his knees, making deep confe&s;&s;ion of guilt: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Could we &s;uppo&s;e one Jewi&s;h Univer&s;ali&s;t pre&s;ent, what would he think of &s;uch conduct.</NOTE> See 9th chapter. Nehemiah al&s;o &s;aw Jews which had married wives of other nations, and he contended with them, and cur&s;ed them, and plucked off their hair, &amp;c. Neh. xiii. 23&mdash;25. and it is called a great evil, 27 v. Their tru&s;ting in other nations in&s;tead of God their protector is &s;everely re|proved. Their going to Egypt to &s;trengthen them&s;elves in the &s;trength of Pharaoh, and tru&s;ting in the &s;hadow of Egypt, is declared to be to their &s;hame and con|fu&s;ion, I&s;a. xxx. 3. Their affinity both with Egypt and A&s;&s;yria is mentioned, Jer. ii. 18. and the plain language of it declared to be this, viz. 'I have loved &s;trangers, and after them will I go.' 25 v. The &s;ame is expo&s;ed as abominable whoredom, Ezek. xvi. So that to be otherwi&s;e than entirely di&s;tinct from all other nations was highly provoking to God.</P>
<P>The Jews to this day retain traces of the ancient di&s;tinction which God e&s;tabli&s;hed between them and the nations, and in them now we &s;ee a faint picture of what took place when that nation was the church of God.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction did not teach them the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation, but be&s;poke the oppo&s;ite. They were ever taught what is expre&s;&s;ed, Eph. ii. 12. 'That the nations were aliens from the common|wealth of I&s;rael, &s;trangers from the covenants of promi&s;e, having no hope, and without God in the world.' The nations were viewed by them as ob|jects of God's vengeance, P&s;al. lxxix. 6.

known thee,' compared with Jer. x. 25. See al&s;o P&s;al. lix. 8. and cxlix. 7. Mic. v. 15, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When the go&s;pel church &s;ucceeded in place of the Jewi&s;h, it plea&s;ed God to collect his people out from the re&s;t of that abandoned nation, to break down the partition, which till that time &s;tood be|tween Jews and the nations, Eph. ii. 14. and to take out of the nations a people for his name. But they are no &s;ooner gathered both from the Jews and Gentiles, than a line of di&s;tinction ari&s;es between them and all the re&s;t of mankind, fully as great as that which had been before between Jews and the re&s;t of mankind. And they are called collectively a nation, Mat. xxi. 43. 'The kingdom of God &s;hall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.' So Peter &s;ays to &s;trangers of various countries collectively, 'Ye are a holy na|tion.' 1 Pet. i. 1. and ii. 9. God was the King of this nation, and however di&s;per&s;ed, they were united under his juri&s;diction. As to the re&s;t in a lump, they were &s;ubject to Satan, the prince of the power of the air, the god of this world. Eph. ii. 2. and 2 Cor. iv. 4. Their entire di&s;tinction appears in their firm union together, and &s;uffering for the truth unto the death, being undivided in their belief, or love for the truth's &s;ake; while they kept at the greate&s;t di&s;|tance from communion with others, and checked every thing which looked that way. They &s;tood fa&s;t in one &s;pirit, &s;triving together for the faith of the go&s;pel, in nothing terrified by adver&s;aries which was an evident token of perdition to others, and of &s;alvation to them&s;elves, Phil. i. 27, 28. On the other &s;ide &s;tood men of all nations, hating them mortally, both for the truth they held and that mu|tual love it rai&s;ed in them. Hence followed &s;evere &s;ufferings unto death among the di&s;ciples. A few pa&s;&s;ages may be thrown together for further illu&s;tra|tion, Acts ii. 40. 'Save your&s;elves from this unto|ward generation.' Acts xix. 9. 'He departed &s;epa|rating

the di&s;ciples.' 2 Cor. vi. 17, 18. 'Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye &s;eparate, and touch not the unclean things, and I will receive you and be a father, &amp;c.' 1 Cor. x. 20. 'The things which (ETHNEE) the nations &s;acrifice, they &s;acrifice to devils not to God; and I would not that ye &s;hould have fellow&s;hip with devils.' 2 Tim. iii. 5. 'From &s;uch turn away.' Rev. xviii. 4. 'Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.' Such commands were exemplified by &s;triking fact in tho&s;e days, which &s;hewed them (though di&s;per&s;ed) to be one body fully as di&s;tinct from the world as the Jews had been. So that in the one Chri&s;tian nation as well as the Jewi&s;h tho&s;e words were verified, Numb. xxiii. 9. 'Lo the people &s;hall dwell alone, and &s;hall not be reckoned among the nations.' <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This di&s;tinction has been long &s;ince thrown down, which opened the flood-gates to all manner of error about the Chri&s;tian doctrine and practice, as might be ea&s;ily &s;hewn.</NOTE> Now why does God enjoin &s;uch a di&s;tinction and &s;eparation, if all are objects of mercy? If all men are brethren in Je&s;us, why is this breach among brethren in the family of God, upon whom unity and love are &s;o &s;trongly enjoined? This &s;epa|ration be&s;peaks &s;ome men di&s;tingui&s;hed from others as to forgivene&s;s, as they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the fir&s;t &s;inners, the devils. Agreeable to this di&s;tinc|tion the di&s;ciples only are addre&s;&s;ed as partakers of &s;alvation: See Gal. i. 4. 'Who gave him&s;elf for our &s;ins.' 1 Pet. ii. 24. 'Who bare our &s;ins in his own body.' 1 The&s;&s;. v. 9. 'For God hath not ap|pointed us to wrath, but to obtain &s;alvation by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.' <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Many religious doctors, either from ignorance or de&s;ign, burying out of &s;ight the above di&s;tinction, without fear apply &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions to whole pari&s;hes, and thereby draw much re&s;pect, and unite large congregations, in e&s;teem for them as godly men, for all love to be complimented about having a &s;hare in good things beyond the grave, and return the compli|ment in e&s;teem. Both the Jews and Chri&s;tians were exceed|ingly hated for it. Yea, and all that will maintain it &s;hall fall under the &s;ame hatred, agreeable to 2 Tim. iii. 12.</NOTE> Such language is confined

<P>But to proceed. The above &s;eparation is brought to a clo&s;er point of view in the commanded di&s;ci|pline of a church; &s;ee Mat. xviii. 15&mdash;19. Here in ca&s;e of tre&s;pa&s;s, the offended is ordered to &s;peak to the offender alone; if repentance does not ap|pear to take one or two more, and if &s;till un&s;ucce&s;s|ful to tell it to the church; and if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican&mdash;'Verily, what ye bind on earth &s;hall be bound in heaven, &amp;c.' In ca&s;e of an e&s;tabli&s;hed character in wickedne&s;s it is thus ordered 1 Cor. v. 11.

<PB N="23" REF="019452_0022_0FABA4A5202CB1C0">
may be &s;aved in the day of the Lord Je&s;us. Had the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation been held at that time there was nothing fearful held up to the offen|der's con&s;cience beyond the grave; and no force in the whole tran&s;action as done on earth, or ratified in heaven; and it tended not to the &s;pirits being &s;aved, for by this doctrine the man would be &s;aved, whether it had any effect or not; and it was a ridiculous farce in religion. Should a company of Univer&s;ali&s;ts at|tend to the&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ible commands, what con|&s;i&s;tency would their appear in their doctrine and prac|tice? And might not each of them &s;ay, when he had fini&s;hed the &s;olemn act, as in Prov. xxvi. 19. 'Am not I in &s;port?' &s;poken of him who deceiveth his neighbour. There was &s;omething &s;triking about the church of God, both in the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian form, which, like the cloud between the I&s;raelites and Egyptians, afforded cheering light to &s;ome, but darkne&s;s and horror to others. The church is the light of the world, and &s;ome were drawn by its re|viving light, but others were di&s;mayed, it appear|ing to them like a dark cloud of threatning a&s;pect. See P&s;. xlviii. 1&mdash;7. After a de&s;cription of her glory, having God in the mid&s;t of her, 'tis added. 'For lo the kings a&s;&s;embled, they pa&s;&s;ed by together! They &s;aw it and &s;o they marvelled, they were troubled and ha&s;ted away; fear took hold upon them, and pain as of a woman in travail.' Song vi. 10. She is &s;aid to 'look forth as the morning, and yet to be terrible as an army with banners; &s;he had nothing &s;ightly as to worldly appearance, like her Lord!' Yet as they were di&s;mayed even when they went to take him, John xviii. 6: So there was &s;omething of the &s;ame di&s;may among the per&s;ecutors of the di&s;ciples. The per&s;ecutors of Stephen &s;aw &s;omething about him that &s;truck them with awe, Acts vi. 15. Felix, though a governor, who had Paul's life at his di&s;po|&s;al, could not forbear trembling before his pri&s;oner. Had he not collected from Paul's rea&s;oning and ap|pearance

a &s;trong idea of a grand di&s;tinction among men in the next world, it may be pre&s;umed he had not been forced thus to tremble, out of character as it might &s;eem. To mention no more, when they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch, it is &s;aid, and of the re&s;t dur&s;t no man join him&s;elf to them. Thus &s;triking was the appearance of the church of God, and from beholding her counte|nance fears of future wrath &s;eized her enemies.</P>
<P>Again, the enmity e&s;tabli&s;hed between God's peo|ple and the world confirms the above mentioned di&s;|tinction, and &s;tands oppo&s;ed to the doctrine of Uni|ver&s;al Salvation. Gen. iii. 15. 'I will put enmity between thee, and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed.' This was &s;oon manife&s;t in the fami|ly of Adam, and afterwards in the families of the Pa|triarchs. It may be &s;een in the Egyptian's hot pur|&s;uit of I&s;rael, and in the &s;ong of triumph on account of their de&s;truction, Exod. xv cap. It appeared in Amelek oppo&s;ing the travels of I&s;rael, Exod. xvii c. which occa&s;ioned the&s;e words, 'The Lord hath &s;worn that the Lord will have war with Amelek from generation to generation.' King Saul was charged to cut them off without mercy; and for &s;paring Agag, &amp;c. the kingdom was rent from him. Ama|lek is a &s;tanding type of all the enemies of God's peo|ple. We read Jer. xii. 9. 'Mine heritage is unto me as a &s;peckled bird, the birds round about are a|gain&s;t her.' The Apo&s;tle gives a &s;ummary view, Gal. iv. 28. 'Now we brethern as I&s;aac was, are the chil|dren of promi&s;e; but as then he that was born after the fle&s;h per&s;ecuted him after the &s;pirit, even &s;o it is now;' and adds, 'the &s;on of the bond woman &s;hall not be heir with the &s;on of the free.' This enmity has been drawn out in real life wherever a church of God has appeared, and was &s;trikingly &s;een among the fir&s;t di&s;ciples. The Lord &s;ays, he is come to &s;et fire on earth, to &s;end a &s;word and divi&s;ion, and to &s;et a man

<P><PB N="26" REF="019452_0025_0FABA4A723F17E08" MS="y">The di&s;tinction of heaven's favourites from the world is confirmed in the ixth of Romans compared with the xith cap. The Apo&s;tle mentions his hea|vine&s;s for his countrymen the Jews, who were bro|ken off from the olive tree, and under wrath.

He &s;aith to Mo&s;es, 'I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compa&s;&s;ion on whom I will, &amp;c.' Then he introduces Pharaoh as rai&s;ed up to declare God's power and name abroad, and adds 18th ver&s;e. 'Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.' He &s;uppo&s;es another objection formed 19th ver&s;e, 'Thou wilt then &s;ay unto me, why doth he yet find fault, for who hath re&s;i&s;ted his will?'

And who the la&s;t are we are particularly informed, Us whom he hath cal|led out of the Jews, and out of the Gentiles, and &s;o cannot be all the Jews and all the Gentiles.

They may &s;ee their own objections &s;tated and an|&s;wered by the Apo&s;tle, which confirm his meaning beyond contradiction, to the confu&s;ion of all who would break his thread of rea&s;oning here. Agreeable to this, &s;ee Rom. xi. 7. 'I&s;rael hath not obtained that which he &s;eeketh for, but the election hath ob|tained it, and the re&s;t were blinded.' 2 The&s;. ii. 11&mdash;13.

<P><PB N="28" REF="019452_0027_0FABA4A98D4406D0">What the Apo&s;tle te&s;tifies of God's favours being be&s;towed according to his plea&s;ure agrees with what the Lord declared when entering upon his public mini&s;try; he as it were opened his commi&s;&s;ion from the prophet E&s;aias, applying the&s;e words to him&s;elf: 'The &s;pirit of the Lord is upon me, becau&s;e he hath anointed me to preach the go&s;pel to the poor&mdash;de|liverance to the captives&mdash;and the acceptable year of the Lord.' Luke iv. 17&mdash;20. The whole a&s;&s;embly were delighted, and all eyes were fa&s;tened upon him, and they thought of &s;ome claim to the benefit. But he reminds of one widow only that received it in a great drought, and one leper only in the days of Elijah and Eli&s;ha, and the&s;e per&s;ons not of I&s;rael, while many widows and lepers were neglected in I&s;rael. The Jews well under&s;tood him, pointing out a di&s;tinction made among men as to the favours of heaven, as ap|pears in the &s;equel, Wrath took the place of their delight, they thru&s;t him out of the city to ca&s;t him down a precipice headlong. A parallel to this we have John vi. 25, to the end, where many who were at fir&s;t well plea&s;ed upon making known that the mer|cies of heaven were of God's good plea&s;ure without any claim, they fled from him till he turns to the twelve, 'Will ye al&s;o go away.' The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages con&s;pire to throw their joint light together as it were into a focal point, manife&s;ting with radiancy, that God's high plea&s;ure di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;ome men from others as to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The &s;ame di&s;tinction is held up in a different view, Rev. xiii. 8. 'All &s;hall wor&s;hip him who&s;e names are not written in the &s;lain Lamb's book of life.' Chap. xx. 15. 'Who&s;oever was not written in the book of life was ca&s;t into a lake of fire.' Chap. xxi. 27. And there &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into it any thing
<PB N="29" REF="019452_0028_0FABA4AA27DD5A50" MS="y">
that defileth, but they who are written in the Lamb's book of life.' No proof is here needed that &s;ome men's names are written in that book and others are not, and the former &s;hall enter heaven and the latter be ca&s;t into a lake of fire. This is according to the mere plea&s;ure of God, and was done from the foun|dation of the world.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture pre&s;ents it al&s;o in another view, and that is, that God gave Je&s;us &s;ome of mankind and not others. John xvii. 2. 'As thou ha&s;t given him pow|er over all fle&s;h, that he &s;hould give eternal life to as many as thou ha&s;t given him.' Ver&s;e 6. "I have manife&s;ted thy name to the men which thou gave&s;t me out of the world.' They are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the world, who are &s;aid 14th ver&s;e, to hate them. Ver&s;e 9. 'I pray for them, I pray not for the world.' See al&s;o 8, 12, 19, 24, ver&s;es. In Chap. v. 37. 'tis &s;aid, 'All that the father giveth me &s;hall come to me.' Ver&s;e 40th, 'And ye will not come to me that ye might have life.' John x. 15. 'I will lay down my life for the &s;heep.' Ver&s;e 26th, 'But ye believe not, becau&s;e ye are not of my &s;heep.' If the&s;e do not force men to &s;ee a di&s;tinction, what will do it? But it is objected, that the Lord &s;ays, 'Other &s;heep I have, which are not of this fold.' John x. 16. 'Tis true, and adds, 'They &s;hall hear my voice,' where|by they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e who do not hear his voice.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e words, John xvii. 9, may draw particular notice, 'I pray not for the world, but for them which thou ha&s;t given me.' There is not a petition in this prayer that looks as if he prayed for all mankind, but it is confined to a number, taken out of the world, and hated by them. But what is more, his expre&s;s declaration, 'I pray not for the world,' decides the matter. They who can evade the force of it now, could do it if it had been repeated ever &s;o many times. In this &s;olemn prayer and the di&s;cour&s;e that went before it, the Lord expre&s;&s;es bowels of tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="30" REF="019452_0029_0FABA4B5DCF78700">
to the di&s;ciples, and his language is the very image and picture of that heart which was going freely to bleed for them; and if it was to bleed for all mankind, is it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould &s;ay, I pray not for the world, but for tho&s;e whom thou ha&s;t given me? This prayer preceding his agony, is doubtle&s;s of the &s;ame &s;pirit with the interce&s;&s;ion he now makes at the Father's right hand. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that he now takes in that petition which he before rejected, &s;o as &s;ay now I pray for the world. Aaron was a type, and when he entered into the holy place, upon his brea&s;t plate, and upon his heart, were written the names of tho&s;e for whom he appeared there. And what names were they? Names of the Egyptians and Amalekites, &amp;c. No. Exod. xxviii. 29, 'Aaron &s;hall bear the names of the children of I&s;rael in the brea&s;t-plate of judgement upon his heart when he goeth into the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually.' It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, without violence, that the Egyptians, Amalekites, &amp;c. had any intere&s;t in what he tran&s;acted. So Je&s;us the anti-type bears only the names of the true I&s;rael, whom the Father had given him out of the world. And we cannot, without like violence, &s;uppo&s;e that the world at large have any in|tere&s;t in what he tran&s;acts for his people in heaven. So that all the expre&s;&s;ions which point out his near connexion with his people, and the ble&s;&s;ings ari&s;ing from it, re&s;pect only tho&s;e whom the Father gave him out of the world. The&s;e make the church purcha&s;ed with his own blood, and are the body of which he is head, are members of his body, of his fle&s;h, and his bones, are the temple of the living God, in which he dwells, are the branches united to him the vine, are married to him. The&s;e &s;imilitudes point out not a connexion between him and all mankind, but re|&s;pect only tho&s;e the Father gave him. God &s;aid not to Babylon as he &s;aid to I&s;rael, I am married to you, The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the &s;aints at Rome being mar|ried to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he does not &s;ay, all Rome, or all

the world, was married to him. The church of the The&s;&s;alonians are &s;aid to be in God the Father and in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but their per&s;ecuting country|men mentioned, 1 Epi&s;t. ii. 14. are not &s;aid to be in God the Father and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Nor were any of the The&s;&s;alonians, except the church, or that &s;mall company called out from among them, to whom the go&s;pel came not in word only but in pow|er, 1 Epi&s;t. i.</P>
<P>The &s;ame idea of de&s;tinction among men is &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the direction given by the &s;pirit, calling them to preach the go&s;pel in one place, and forbid|ing to go to another. They were forbid to go into Bithynia, Acts xvi. 7, and are called to go into Ma|cedonia, 9, 10, ver&s;es, and commanded to &s;peak with boldne&s;s in another for this rea&s;on, 'I have much people in this city,' Acts xviii. 9, 10. And we find in all ages, and at this day, the preaching of Je&s;us and the Apo&s;tles is by the providence of God carried to one place and not to another. Grand kingdoms at this pre&s;ent time are de&s;titute of the words of eter|nal life, and we mu&s;t conclude, that God has not a people among them.</P>
<P>We find moreover, that where the go&s;pel is preach|ed a &s;elect number only are taken out as the favorites of heaven, as the fact every where &s;hews in the new te&s;tament. When the Apo&s;tle turned from the Jews to preach to the Gentiles, Acts xiii. 48, it is &s;aid, 'As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.' It is a plain violation of text, and it makes a di&s;tinction to &s;ay, all the&s;e Gentiles were ordained to eternal life, or that all believed.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel was not only publi&s;hed where God had a people, but it was believed by them, and this di&s;|tingui&s;hed them from the re&s;t as being the only heirs of &s;alvation. The go&s;pel ever went forth with the&s;e legible characters upon its front, 'He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.' Faith and &s;alvation are connected in &s;crip|ture,
<PB N="32" REF="019452_0031_0FABA4C3D0187BC0">
as faith and being healed were in the days of Je&s;us. The pa&s;&s;ages that connect faith and &s;alvation are too numerous to repeat, and are obvious to tho&s;e who look into the Bible. It may be a&s;ked, what oc|ca&s;ion for connecting faith at all if all men are &s;aved? It is lo&s;t labour, and the words are but wind, if unbe|lievers are &s;aved. If we &s;hould invert the expre&s;&s;ions in many in&s;tances they would &s;peak agreeable to the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation. Mark xvi. 16, mu&s;t be read thus, he that believeth <HI>not</HI> &s;hall be &s;aved. And we mu&s;t under&s;tand a great part of &s;cripture to mean the oppo&s;ite to what it expre&s;&s;es. Indeed one is led to think of nece&s;&s;ity for a new edition of the Bible, to make its language plain to common under|&s;tanding, and turning its negatives into affirmatives; and its affirmatives into negatives.</P>
<P>A few pa&s;&s;ages only may be mentioned which connect faith with ju&s;tification and &s;alvation. The Apo&s;tle of &s;et purpo&s;e undertakes to &s;hew how men are brought into favour with God. He &s;hews there is not one righteous, that all the world are guilty, and every mouth mu&s;t be &s;topped, and draws this firm conclu&s;ion, Chap. iii. 20. 'Therefore, by the deeds of the law there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight.' Man being thus effectually &s;hut out from the divine favour by guilt, and ruined forever as to any thing he can do him&s;elf; a &s;upernatural way of acce&s;s is laid open by the Apo&s;tle. And it de&s;erves attention how far, and for whom it is opened 21, 22, ver&s;es, 'But now the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God without the law is manife&s;ted, being witne&s;&s;ed by the law and the prophets, even the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God which is by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto all, and upon all <HI>them that believe.</HI>' Here the grand door of hope is thrown open for the guilty, and the conveyance of an all-&s;ufficient righteou&s;ne&s;s to them who are de&s;titute, is declared; but it is as certainly declared to be by faith unto them who believe, as it is declared that &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s is revealed at all. To &s;ay that the
<PB N="33" REF="019452_0032_0FABA4C4617C5788" MS="y">
righteou&s;ne&s;s of God is manife&s;ted which is not by faith, but is unto all who do not believe as well as tho&s;e who do is a perver&s;ion of the &s;cripture in a capital point.

Here again, while works are di&s;carded &s;alvation comes to the believer, and is confined to him, yea his faith is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s as Abraham's faith was ver&s;e 22.

'He is lifted up, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have eternal life.' Believing and not believing are in three pa&s;&s;ages &s;et in oppo|&s;ition to each other, and &s;alvation is connected with the former, and damnation with the latter, Mark xvi. 16.

<P>The &s;criptures connect repentance with &s;alvation, and impenitence with damnation. Repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins were fir&s;t publi&s;hed in his name, Luke xxiv. 27. Acts ii. 38. Acts xi. 18.

He does not mean that they &s;hould have a tower fall upon them too, or &s;uffer a violent death, for he rejects the idea of being greater &s;inners on account of &s;uffering &s;uch things. He mu&s;t mean peri&s;hing under the wrath of God beyond the grave. If there be no puni&s;hment for men hereafter what can be meant by the &s;econd death, Rev. ii. 11.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN Je&s;us &s;ent his Apo&s;tles forth to pub|li&s;h the good news, he tells them to &s;hake off the du&s;t of their feet again&s;t tho&s;e that did not hear their words; and declares with a verily, 'That it &s;hall be more tolerable for Sodom in the day of judgment than for them, Mat. x. 15. Are they then equally heirs of &s;alvation with tho&s;e who believe their words? How will it be more tolerable, if neither of them will &s;uffer any thing? This agrees with the woes denounced upon Chorazin, Beth&s;aida and Ca|pernaum, xi. Chap. 21&mdash;24. When the Jews bla&s;|phemed, Paul te&s;tifying, that Je&s;us was Chri&s;t, he &s;hook his raiment, and &s;aid, 'Your blood be upon your heads.' Does he mean by this, that they &s;hould come to a violent death, as Chri&s;tians did at that time more than any other men? No. It points to the &s;econd death, the &s;ame which Mo&s;es refers to when prophecying of the great prophet Je&s;us being rai&s;ed up, he &s;ays, 'He that will not hearken to him &s;hall be de&s;troyed.' Deut. xviii. 15. compared with Acts iii. 22, 23. When the Apo&s;tle &s;poke weeping, of many profe&s;&s;ors who were taking their good things in this life, Phil. iii. 18, 19. for their God was their belly, and they minded earthly things, he declared their end was de&s;truction. The mind of every &s;ober man is forcibly con&s;trained to think of a de&s;truction beyond this life. The Apo&s;tle, 2 Cor. v. 11. having men|tioned, that every one mu&s;t appear before the judge|ment

&s;eat of Chri&s;t, to receive according to his deeds, adds, 'Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we per&s;uade men.' They did not &s;trike terrors out of the face of their go&s;pel, which their whole te&s;ti|mony &s;hews. While ground of &s;trong confidence was &s;ugge&s;ted, through the propitiation, &s;trong fears al&s;o of the coming wrath were inculcated, and they fled for refuge, to lay hold of the hope &s;et before them.

The highe&s;t pride and &s;elf-conceit is thus gratified by tho&s;e who are more the children of hell than before. Their religion will not bear the touch &s;tone of &s;elf-denied obedience after all their boa&s;ting. Their religion may be compared to ba&s;er metals wa&s;hed over, to re&s;emble gold or &s;ilver, which lo&s;e their wa&s;h &s;oon, and appear ba&s;er than ever.

In the great antichri&s;tian body, which before were proof again&s;t the terrors of the Apo&s;tles, and are now crowned with this doctrine, one may &s;ee Leviathan compleat.</P>
<P>The Lord argues from his own &s;ufferings, the &s;uf|ferings of his final enemies, Luke xxiii. 31. 'If they do the&s;e things in the green tree, what &s;hall be done in the dry? The &s;ame is argued from the &s;ufferings of his body, the church, 1 Pet. iv. 17. 'For the time is come that judgement mu&s;t begin at the hou&s;e of God, and if fir&s;t at us, what &s;hall be the end of them who obey not the go&s;pel of God.' See al&s;o, 2 The&s;&s;. i. 5.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="019452_0037_0FABA4C84923EB88">The &s;econd coming of Je&s;us is &s;poken of as the joy of his people and the terror of his final enemies. While he comes to give re&s;t to the former he appears in flaming fire, taking vengeance upon the latter, who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction, &s;ee at large, 2 The&s;&s;. i. 7&mdash;11. Sudden de&s;truction will come upon them when crying peace and &s;afety, Chap. v. 3. 'And thus they will be taken as fi&s;hes in a net, or birds in a &s;nare,' Eccle. ix. 12. 'And it will be as in the days of Noah and Lot, when de|&s;truction <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If one &s;ays there will no de&s;truction of any men, when he comes, he gives his Maker the lye, who &s;ays it &s;hall be as it was then when the flood came and de&s;troyed them all.</NOTE> overtook them in the mid&s;t of their plea|&s;ures.' Luke xvii. 26&mdash;30. Thus temporal de&s;truc|tions were types of future de&s;truction, as much as temporal &s;alvations were types.</P>
<P>The Lord fairly delineates (and he well knew) the un&s;een world in a parable, Luke xvi. 19&mdash;ult. where the beggar from di&s;tre&s;s was tran&s;ported to happine&s;s; but he who had received his good things in his life time, dyed and was buried. And what follows after his death? 'And in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments, and cries for a drop of water to cool his tongue,' which is denyed; and he informed he has already received all his comforts, and of an impa&s;&s;able gulph fixed between him and the ble&s;&s;ed. Now if all men are &s;aved, this is not &s;o much as a parable or repre&s;entation, but is a mere farce and fiction.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tolic weapons, which produced mighty conque&s;ts in tho&s;e days, are &s;aid to have in readine&s;s to revenge all di&s;obedience when the obedience of &s;aints is fulfilled, 2 Cor. x. 6. Let it not be wonder|ed, that this is a&s;cribed to their weapons &s;ince Je&s;us &s;ays, John xii. 48. 'The word that I have &s;poken &s;hall judge him at the la&s;t day.' See al&s;o, Rev. xi. 5. Where the two witne&s;&s;es, the old and new te&s;ta|ment, are repre&s;ented as de&s;troying their enemies by
<PB N="39" REF="019452_0038_0FABA4C8E4CA2AC8">
fire, bur&s;ting from their mouth. The&s;e have in rea|dine&s;s to revenge all di&s;obedience, but are waiting for for the completion of the obedience of the &s;aints. This agrees with the reply to the &s;ouls under the altar, crying, how long do&s;t thou not avenge our blood? viz. that they &s;hould re&s;t yet for a little &s;ea&s;on until their fellow &s;ervants al&s;o, that &s;hould be killed as they were &s;hould be fulfilled. When what is behind of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t is accompli&s;hed, and they have had their cour&s;e through every part of his body, the church, then the arrows will fly &s;uddenly from the &s;tring, and wrath blaze upon them that know not God, and obey not the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>In Luke xiii. 23. one puts this que&s;tion to Je&s;us, 'Lord, are there few that be &s;aved?' Does not this imply the que&s;tion, that has been attended to? May we not expect a deci&s;ive an&s;wer? Can we &s;uppo&s;e the an&s;wer of any man living can be more relied on? Shall we dare to a&s;k whether he knew, or if he did, whether he was willing to deceive about it? The enquirer took it for granted, that &s;ome would not be &s;aved, which &s;entiment Je&s;us does not repel, nor charge him with having contracted thoughts; but immediately infor|ces upon his mind, that many will peri&s;h, 24&mdash;28. 'Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate; for many &s;hall &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able.' 'When once the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e hath ri&s;en up and &s;hut the door, and ye begin to &s;tand without, and to knock at the door, &s;aying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he &s;hall an&s;wer and &s;ay unto you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity, there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth, &amp;c.' See agreeing with this, Mat. vii. 22, 23. The para|ble of the virgins, Mat. xxv. 10&mdash;12. The parable of the tares, and of the net, Mat. xiii. 42, 50. But what need of turning to many pa&s;&s;ages? Je&s;us &s;peaks in direct reply to the que&s;tion, and if all men but one upon earth &s;hould &s;ay contrary, he would have ground &s;ufficient to tell them they were all liars, and he has

the word of one of more weight than them all. One might go on to fill whole pages with mere quota|tions without any remarks, it would rather be tire|&s;ome. The &s;criptures already quoted in &s;undry ways and divers manners, in doctrines, in di&s;cipline, in practice, and expre&s;s declarations, plainly &s;hew it will be the unhappy lot of &s;ome men to be damned. And though the thought be painful, and each one may fear how it will be with him&s;elf; yet it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that they &s;tand together as a &s;trong bulwark not to be overthrown. If giddy mortals avail them&s;elves of that freedom of expre&s;&s;ion, which is not unbecoming the God of heaven to u&s;e, and catch up &s;cattered texts, where the word all is u&s;ed, and determine greedily, that every individual of mankind will be &s;aved. They are unlearned and un&s;table, and wre&s;t the &s;criptures to their own de&s;truction. It might as well be con|cluded that God's &s;pirit was poured out upon every individual of mankind, upon the day of Penteco&s;t, becau&s;e Peter &s;ays, this is that which was &s;poken by the prophet Joel, viz. 'I will pour out my &s;pirit up|on all fle&s;h;' or that every individual is included in what is &s;aid. Acts iv. 21. 'All men glorified God for that which was done;' though the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age informs, that the rulers threatened, and &s;ought to puni&s;h them.

The di&s;ciples to whom they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> when they at fir&s;t received the truth were impre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly with an idea, that could never be oblitera|ted while holding the truth, and mu&s;t have a leading influence in all the views that were received after, viz. that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins were in&s;e|parably connected; and that he who believed not &s;hould be damned. So the Apo&s;tles preached, and
<PB N="43" REF="019452_0042_0FABA4E87A559030" MS="y">
&s;o they believed. This was not only impre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t in&s;tant, but &s;trongly enforced ever af|ter. They mu&s;t infallibly con&s;ider this pre&s;ent evil world re&s;embling Sodom, and God's cho&s;en or church fleeing from approaching de&s;truction, as Lot's family from Sodom, &s;ee Heb. vi. 18. 'We &mdash;who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope &s;et before us.' Could they have a di&s;tant idea, that the word all re&s;pected the world at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, of which Sodom was a type, and its de&s;truc|tion a type of theirs? Could they demoli&s;h their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion that good hope ri&s;es only in believing, and with it the whole te&s;timony that wrath awaited unbelievers? It cannot be. The univer&s;al expre&s;|&s;ions mu&s;t infallibly be under&s;tood to mean the whole redeemed body made up of Jews and Gentiles, Greeks, Barbarians, bond and free, &amp;c. in every age, and them only. To under&s;tand it further would be contrary to their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and all the doc|trines they heard, and all the di&s;cipline and practice they &s;aw, and every thing about the profe&s;&s;ion. This grand collection of all &s;orts makes a world, though cho&s;en out of the world, and a general view of them is given Rev. v. 9. and Rev. vii. 1&mdash;10. 'Though collected out of nations are a nation.' 1 Pet. ii. 9. 'And are the glory and honour of the nations.' Rev. xxi. 26.</P>
<P>Why do not men eager to catch hold of the word all in this ca&s;e, and extend it to every individual, do the &s;ame with &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e! Mark i. 37. 'All men &s;eek for thee.' John iii. 26. 'The fame baptizeth and all men come to him.' John xii. 19. 'The world is gone after him;' To do it in this ca&s;e does not &s;o much oppo&s;e the united force of truth as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. The rea&s;on is, they have not &s;o &s;trong a temptation from the wi&s;h of the heart.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that men who know not the au|thority of God &s;peaking in the &s;criptures, nor the &s;ame authority in the fir&s;t churches, the living epi&s;|tles,
<PB N="44" REF="019452_0043_0FABA4E92A48E7C8">
wherein that word was drawn out in real life; nor their reigning &s;entiments and awful di&s;cipline in &s;eparation from the world, who form the loo&s;e&s;t ideas both of that word and of churches, will have dark|ne&s;s in their paths, and &s;tumble at &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions. But could they for once realize the appearance of the churches in Judea, with thoughts and hearts in uni|&s;on, &s;triking terror into the hearts of their enemies, it would da&s;h in a moment their readine&s;s to apply the word all to tho&s;e who know not God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The church of the living God is a medium through which truth is &s;een. 'It is the light of the world.' Mat. v. 14. It is called the pillar and ground of the truth. We may then view it as a beacon, a monu|ment, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of truth upon earth. Her light is derived from the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and like the moon &s;he reflects it upon the world. And as an epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t the mind of Chri&s;t was read in her conduct, as well as in what was written in the Bible. Tho&s;e formerly who looked through this medium received very different impre&s;&s;ions, from tho&s;e who look through the medium of what are now called churches, which bear no re&s;em|blance; and fail in the fir&s;t in&s;tance of being a body gathered in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;eparated from the world, and exerci&s;ing the appointed di&s;|cipline. As the fir&s;t churches might be called a living comment upon the &s;criptures, and impre&s;&s;ions of truth were taken from them, in connexion with the written word; &s;o men at this day are led in their under&s;tanding about the meaning of &s;cripture, by the deceitful comment in what are called churches; and as the&s;e are broken, divided, and oppo&s;ed; no wonder it is all confu&s;&s;ion among them as among the Babel builders formerly.</P>
<P>A text or two may be added to tho&s;e mentioned before, &s;hewing the certainty of future puni&s;hment; one is Mark ix. 43&mdash;49. The Lord here directs to
<PB N="45" REF="019452_0044_0FABA4E9E59114A8">
part with a hand, foot or an eye, that offends, be|cau&s;e it is better to enter life without them than to go into hell with them. And he repeats five times that the fire is not quenched, and three times that the worm dieth not. If any one will turn to the pa&s;|&s;age and read it deliberately he may be a&s;ked the&s;e que&s;tions when he has done. Does the Lord call to the lo&s;s of any earthly enjoyment in order to en|ter life? Does he labour a point? What point does he labour? Is it Univer&s;al Salvation? Or is it the doctrine of damnation? Or is he full of words with|out any thing to the purpo&s;e, and making much ado about nothing? Who dare &s;ay he is holding up a bugbear to terrify his friends to part with their neare&s;t enjoyments in life, and that they like fools took him to be in earne&s;t, &s;o as lo&s;e even life it &s;elf afterwards.</P>
<P>One text more may he con&s;idered. In the 25th chapter of Matthew, the final judge (though then in aba&s;ement) lays open the tran&s;actions of the la&s;t day to his friends; and informs that when &s;eated upon his throne all nations &s;hall be gathered, and he &s;hall &s;eparate them from one another, placing &s;ome on his right hand and others upon his left; and &s;hall addre&s;s him&s;elf to the one, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed, &amp;c. and then to the other, Depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, &amp;c. and in 46th ver&s;e, it is &s;aid, The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, but the righ|teous into life eternal. See the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue of that day Rev. xx. 15. The meaning that fir&s;t pre&s;ents it&s;elf is, that &s;ome men are appointed to happine&s;s at that time, and others to mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the &s;eparation here means only a &s;eparation of crimes from per&s;ons. An&s;wer; nations are gathered and he &s;eparates them one an|other, and as they are a collection of per&s;ons it mu&s;t be, that he &s;eparates per&s;ons from one another. And the &s;ufferers of this puni&s;hment are &s;aid to wail and gna&s;h their teeth, ver&s;e 30th of this chapter, and Mat. xiii. 42, 50, which cannot be applicable to crimes,
<PB N="46" REF="019452_0045_0FABA4EAA107FE60">
they being not the &s;ubjects of pain or action. Such trifling eva&s;ions are not u&s;ed where men's worldly in|tere&s;t is at &s;take. Men do not take &s;uch liberty in con&s;truing the words of a law book. A man would make him&s;elf ridiculous that &s;hould do it. For in|&s;tance, the laws declare, that any per&s;on guilty of murder &s;hall be put to death. A man is brought upon trial, full evidence appears again&s;t him, and he is brought in guilty, by the verdict of a jury. Upon this the judge ri&s;es up to pronounce &s;entence, that he &s;hall be hanged, till he is dead; but the pri&s;oner's attorney gets up and informs his honour of a mi&s;take which he labours under, and &s;ays, it is not the mean|ing of the law to hurt men, or that they &s;hould &s;uf|fer in per&s;on but &s;imply to purge their crimes, and therefore that the meaning of the law cannot reach farther than that his client &s;hould be hung in effigy, and he prays that the per&s;on him&s;elf might be &s;et at liberty. Should a plea like this be made at the grand court hereafter, one <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of how much avail it will be to a di&s;charge.</P>
<P>Others have &s;aid, that tho&s;e upon the left hand are devils. An&s;wer, if &s;o then devils are part of the na|tions gathered at that time, and are the part which is &s;eparated. And a rea&s;on of their &s;entence is that they fed not the lea&s;t of the brethren of the judge, when hungry, did not cloathe, &amp;c. It is difficult to conceive how the devil can do this. Can any man think this to be the great article of charge again&s;t the devil? Does this appear from &s;cripture to be the leading feature of his guilt. If it &s;hould be admitted, might it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ome of them will do it to e&s;cape the &s;entence, for they do not love pain. The truth is men fly to any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in a pinch. It may be que&s;tioned whether greater eva&s;ions were ever made in all the controver|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> that ever were upon religion.</P>

not be &s;aved. Does one wi&s;h to &s;ee many doctrines in a connected chain throwing their joint light into one point, or to &s;ee the whole appearance, di&s;ci|pline, and practice entirely concurring and enforcing the evidence, or to have peremptory declarations of the puni&s;hment of &s;ome men, and to have them re|peated over and over. Does he wi&s;h for a repre&s;en|tation of what pa&s;&s;es in the un&s;een world from one well acquainted there,&mdash;or what pa&s;&s;es at the general judgement, and what is the i&s;&s;ue of the day,&mdash;or to have the que&s;tion plainly put to Je&s;us and plainly an&s;wered,&mdash;or to find the &s;cripture &s;peaking of it throughout, he has them all con&s;piring together and affording as bright evidence as they give upon any point, and indeed as great as words can give. But if men wi&s;h to have the natural meaning of words de&s;troyed, that they may embrace a darling opinion; or to have the rock removed out of its place for them, this is unrea&s;onable, and has been often wi&s;hed in vain. The divine law and all the divine words mu&s;t remain, fixed upon a firm ba&s;is, and heaven and earth will &s;ooner pa&s;s away than one jot or tittle of them fail.</P>
<P>It is true there are a few words recorded in &s;crip|ture, which as we commonly take up language, &s;peak full according to the &s;pirit of this doctrine, as Gen. iii. 4. 'Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die.' Mich. iii. 11. 'No evil can come to us.' Deut. xxix. 19. 'I &s;hall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart. Rev. xviii. 7. 'I &s;it a queen, and am no widow, and &s;hall &s;ee no &s;orrow.' Information is giv|en at the &s;ame time who they are &s;poken by, viz. the &s;erpent, the fal&s;e prophets, and the whore of Babylon. And though they have been held as &s;weet by many for ages, yet they have held them &s;o with more of a trem|bling hand, than they do now. A per&s;on is now em|boldened, and with &s;eeming &s;ecurity may behold God ri&s;ing in vehement wrath again&s;t them when they are mentioned, as in the following ver&s;e, Deut. xxix. 20.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE go&s;pel brings glad tidings of great joy for all &s;orts of &s;inners, even the chief. While it gives a deadly &s;tab to the heart, it conveys a life-giv|ing bal&s;am. It pre&s;ents a broad foundation of hope to one in the broade&s;t view of his guilt, and quiets the con&s;cience of man, when fearfully looking for judgement, and fiery indignation. Hence joy comes to pri&s;oners that were appointed to death by the &s;en|tence of the law. Great &s;atisfaction ari&s;es from hear|ing the merciful declarations, he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved&mdash;if any man thir&s;t, let him come to me and drink&mdash;him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out, &amp;c. A per&s;on is then con&s;trained practically to regard tho&s;e words, Mat. xvi. 24. 'If any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s, and follow me:' and to cleave to the Lord with purpo&s;e of heart, in ob&s;erving all things commanded, which is a trial of the reality of his faith. In this way he proves what is that good, acceptable,
<PB N="50" REF="019452_0049_0FABA4F52C0B1DB0" MS="y">
to lead to the ancient &s;eparation, di&s;cipline, and &s;elf-denied ob&s;ervance of all things, commanded to in|&s;pire with fear and trembling, and carry through &s;uf|ferings unto death. This practice in&s;tead of ri&s;ing out of that belief, is a contradiction to it; and it might as well be expected to &s;ee a bramble bu&s;h bearing grapes, as to &s;ee this practice growing out of that faith. The very mention of &s;uch fruits may po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion the di&s;dainful &s;mile; but it may be boldly af|firmed, that go&s;pel faith and &s;uch practice are as clo&s;e|ly connected as body and &s;pirit: and if men trifle with the doctrines or commands of God, who&s;e voice will judge the world, it is done at no &s;mall ri&s;que.</P>
<P>What the Lord &s;ays with regard to fal&s;e prophets, 'Ye know <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The devil <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> led men that length, to believe there is no determining with certainty about their being fal&s;e, and his agents confidently like him&s;elf, &s;ay it is written, 'Judge not, &amp;c.' making Mat. vii. 1. &s;erve their wicked purpo&s;e.</NOTE> them by their fruits', may hold true al&s;o with re&s;pect to doctrines. Certainly if they are op|po&s;ed to fruits they are fal&s;e. Fruits are not what any man, or body of men take it into their heads to call &s;o, but what God him&s;elf calls &s;o. The &s;crip|ture mu&s;t decide that point. And if the branches of love before mentioned connected with a contention for the faith once delivered to the &s;aints be fruits, not only this doctrine, but the whole doctrine of the Chri&s;tian world mu&s;t tumble in ruins. Not but that they may &s;eem to hold &s;ome things which look like truth, but a little leaven leavens the whole ma&s;s, and a little poi&s;on makes a whol&s;ome draught fatal.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture &s;ays, beware of men, and its mean|ing is emphatical, as the attention is called up to one teacher alone, even Chri&s;t. Though he be not bodi|ly pre&s;ent, he as certainly &s;peaks in the &s;cripture as if he were. There is no where el&s;e to go then but to the &s;criptures, which contain the words of eternal life.

need beware of them, as of the devil him&s;elf. It is &s;aid, 2 Pet. ii. 1&mdash;4. 'There were fal&s;e prophets a|mong the people (i. e. the Jews) as there &s;hall be fal&s;e teachers among you;' pointing to the whole &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of them in all ages. He &s;ays al&s;o they &s;hall bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">They get good bread here, therefore this de&s;truction is be|yond the grave.</NOTE> and their damnation &s;lumbereth not. Though it be delay|ed it is wide awake. Turning to the Old Te&s;ta|ment one &s;ees their plau&s;ible character. They were gathered round the two kings, 2 Chron. xviii. &s;peak|ing &s;moothly, but Ahab tells Jeho&s;haphat, 'As to Micaiah, did I not tell thee he would not prophecy good, but evil; and he has a pri&s;on and bread of af|fliction appointed him. Of the&s;e teachers we read, Ezek. xiii. 10. 'They have &s;educed the people, &s;ay|ing, there is peace, and there was no peace.' 16th ver&s;e, &s;ee vi&s;ions of peace when there is no peace. 18th ver&s;e, &s;ew pillows to all arm holes. 22d ver&s;e &s;trengthened the hands of the wicked by promi&s;ing him life. In the xxiii. chapter of Jeremiah, their character is largely de&s;cribed, their language is, 'The Lord hath &s;aid, ye &s;hall have peace, and no evil &s;hall come upon you, &amp;c.' &s;ee at large. As plau&s;ibility marked their character under the law, &s;o it did under the go&s;pel, Rom. xvi. 18. 'By good words and fair &s;peeches deceive the hearts of the &s;imple,' i. e. tho&s;e not taught of God. Paul in the &s;ame &s;pirit with the true prophets &s;ays, in oppo&s;ition to them all, Gal. i. 10. 'For if I yet plea&s;ed man, I &s;hould not be the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t.'</P>

<P>It is natural for men to fancy it will be well with them when this &s;hort life ends. This is manife&s;t from the &s;avage who has victuals, cloaths and am|munition, buried with him, that he may be well fur|ni&s;hed in a vi&s;ionary hunting world of happine&s;s; to the raptured philo&s;opher who fancies, that his &s;pirit will be wa&s;ted on wings divine into unknown de|lightful regions, and like the bee he &s;hall &s;ip delicious draughts from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">known flowers. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The fancy of ancient and modern philo&s;ophers, both Pagan and Chri&s;tian, has had a large range.

<P>It would be endle&s;s to point out the various grada|tions of their hope, and the &s;everal foundations they build it upon. Men are more engaged to get a hope that is &s;trong, than to &s;ee whether it is fixed upon a rock or the &s;and.

<P>Men have had ample employ in cutting out vari|ous &s;chemes of religion to fit the policy of kingdoms or the ta&s;te of the public where they happen to live. Barely to enumerate the &s;ects called Chri&s;tian, would be tedious, much more &s;o to lay open their &s;everal opinions. It may be pre&s;umed none have ri&s;en &s;ince the fir&s;t departure from the faith, that have more texts &s;tanding full faced again&s;t them than the Uni|ver&s;ali&s;ts; or that are put to a greater &s;hift to keep up any plau&s;ibility. The &s;hift made, that tho&s;e on the left hand are crimes, or devils, and not men is the ma&s;ter piece of all eva&s;ions. And if the credit of wit be allowed them here, or a deep in&s;ight in|to human nature, as to what &s;cheme of religion might take with the human mind, yet it mu&s;t be &s;aid it will turn again&s;t them&s;elves in the end, even as it is with the fallen angels, who are not accu&s;ed of want|ing under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Satan was the fir&s;t rea&s;oner upon the words of God, and the &s;tep he took was to lead Eve to que&s;tion the truth and force of them; then finding by her an&s;wer, that &s;he was deviating from the form of words de|livered her, and wavering about them, he pur&s;ues his advantage, and a&s;&s;erts 'Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die.' And &s;ince that day, he goes about &s;eeking whom he may devour, leading men to que&s;tion, whether God hath &s;aid this and the other thing (taking off the
<PB N="54" REF="019452_0053_0FABA4F83A439A88">
force of his words) and to hold loo&s;e the form of &s;ound words delivered them; and to doubt whether the cur&s;es will fall on them, though they walk in the imagination of their hearts. It was not uncommon to fancy an e&s;cape before, but now the conclu&s;ion is drawn fully as bold as at fir&s;t, that no man &s;hall &s;urely die.</P>
<P>The intrepidity with which &s;ome who hold this doctrine may leave this world, is no certain argu|ment that it is true. Dei&s;ts, Pagans, Papi&s;ts, and every &s;ect, have thought they had got evidence of the truth of their re&s;pective &s;chemes from the boldne&s;s with which &s;ome of their followers have died. But a madman's firm belief that he is a king, does not make it evident that he really is &s;o. A man going to the gallows may firmly believe there is an e&s;cape for him, but this alters not his real &s;ituation. It is &s;aid P&s;alm Lxxiii. 4. 'There are no bands in <HI>their</HI> death,' who yet are &s;aid 19th ver&s;e, to be brought into de&s;o|lation in a moment.</P>
<P>Many per&s;ons think this doctrine fal&s;e, and won|der how it could ever gain ground in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a multitude of plain texts, who yet have had a hand in its production. It is a child of their beget|ting, though they are &s;orry for its birth, and neither parent, nor child, are fond of owning each other. This may: &s;eem a &s;trange in&s;inuation. But 'tis cer|tain they bury out of &s;ight the ancient di&s;tinction of the church from the re&s;t of mankind, and its di&s;ci|pline, and with them the e&s;tabli&s;hed enmity, and the &s;ire Je&s;us came to &s;end on earth, while they hold up both in doctrine and practice, that the work of Je&s;us had re&s;pect to all men. Some who dare not a&s;&s;ert it in word, &s;till proclaim it loud in practice, by form|ing a near connexion in religion with the communi|ty at large where they live, &s;o that the very exi&s;tence of their <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><P>Can it want proof that the hierarchy of France and Brit|tain re&s;ts only on government, and wealthy patrons who are chiefly Dei&s;ts laughing in their &s;leeves; and that this is the firm foundation that &s;upports them.</P>

was broke their churches crumble to du&s;t. There cannot be the appearance of con&s;i&s;tency in this, unle&s;s Je&s;us be &s;uppo&s;ed to die for all, and all will be &s;aved. And it is thought to be the height of religion to have what is called univer&s;al charity, which is indeed paving a broad &s;treet for mo&s;t, or all to walk to heaven in. Not only this, but the force of &s;cripture is beaten down, and it is made to give place to traditions, platforms, creeds, &amp;c. that the Bible is not thought &s;ufficient to &s;upport any doctrine without the helping &s;houlder of &s;ome great divine, or number of divines &s;o called. Nay it is become a common je&s;t book to collect expre&s;&s;ions from, to give a high &s;ea&s;oning to wit and mirth. What more could any wi&s;h for, to nullify all its threatenings? What more to lead to the thought that Je&s;us died for all, and that all will be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Damnation has been con&s;idered as a mere bug|bear to frighten children, before publi&s;hing this doc|trine, not only by tho&s;e who to&s;&s;ed it from their tongues in profane oaths, but tho&s;e who preached its terrors to get money. Tho&s;e who have wrote a|gain&s;t this doctrine, have not dared to lay open the root of the &s;cripture doctrine, as &s;tanding again&s;t it, becau&s;e it would be again&s;t their own religion. Pa|ri&s;hes mu&s;t be held at any rate.

in purple and fine linnen, and fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day.</P>
<P>We may now take a brief view of revolutions in the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. In the Apo&s;tles days, the churches, which were in God the Father, and in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, looked forth as the morning, clear as the &s;un, fair as the moon, and terrible as an army with banners. The evidence of the &s;ufferings of Je&s;us with the glory following, bur&s;t into their minds and captivated their hearts. They joyfully quitted their hold of this world, and partook of his &s;ufferings, looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glo|rious appearing of him who gave him&s;elf to redeem them from all iniquity, and purify to him&s;elf a pe|culiar people, zealous of good works. The&s;e works they con&s;idered as an evidence that their faith was unfeigned, and &s;o &s;hould be crowned with &s;alvation. Their faith and works both were hateful to the world, and drew upon them heavy &s;ufferings; but the hope of future glory rai&s;ed their &s;pirits, and &s;trong con&s;o|lations from heaven &s;upported them. The human mind without divine &s;upport &s;hrinks from &s;uch &s;uf|ferings. Thus many at that day varied a little (as it might &s;eem) to e&s;cape di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ee Gal. vi. 12. This deviation continually increa&s;ed afterwards, agreeable to 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 7&mdash;12. Herein were fulfilled 2 Tim. iii. 1. and 1 Tim. iv. 1. When it was con&s;iderably advanced, profe&s;&s;ors ca&s;t a favourable eye towards the morality and maxims of nations, adding tradition, philo&s;ophy, &amp;c. to their profe&s;&s;ion; &s;o that the di&s;|tance between the church and world was very &s;en&s;i|bly le&s;&s;ened. The world failed not to return the compliment, and &s;oon got &s;o favourable an idea of Chri&s;tianity, that it was noticed by the great, and the Emperor of the world introduced it as the reign|ing religion of the Roman empire. Con&s;tantine loaded the Elders, or Bi&s;hops with wealth and ho|nour; and hi&s;tory informs, that a general corruption followed among them. Though this was manife&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="019452_0056_0FABA559A1254A60">
to all men, yet the world continued to lavi&s;h its fa|vours and increa&s;e their grandeur, till upon the fall of the we&s;tern empire, and its being divided among ten kings they all yielded &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop, and in this the prophecy, Rev. xvii. 12, 13. was fulfilled. This was within five hundred years from the Apo&s;tles days. This haughty pontiff had &s;way for ages, over princes and &s;ubjects, requiring an implicit faith in what he declared to be the mind of God, while the &s;criptures were locked up out of &s;ight; and at the &s;ame time the greate&s;t barbarities were ex|erci&s;ed upon tho&s;e who could not &s;wallow his dic|tates, and this under pretence of zeal for God. Mean while the gro&s;&s;e&s;t vices ran through the whole body of the clergy, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t opinions were preached by them, and believed by the people.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;ible check was given to his career in the 16th century, by Luther, Calvin, and others, who boldly exclaimed again&s;t the corruptions of the church of Rome, cau&s;ed the &s;criptures to be publi&s;hed, and &s;eemed to revive the contention for the faith once de|livered to the &s;aints. But the&s;e contenders in&s;tead of di&s;appearing in this world, and becoming united with a poor and afflicted people tru&s;ting in the name of the Lord; willingly admitted princes to take up their cau&s;e and &s;upport it by their power. Thus it became a cau&s;e of the kingdoms of this world, in&s;tead of a conten|tion of the church of Chri&s;t in &s;eparation from the world as at the beginning. So that Chri&s;tianity was brought into a &s;tate re&s;embling what it was in the days of Con&s;tantine. The followers of the&s;e reform|ers have been relaxing more and more from any thing about them, which had any appearance of the Apo&s;|tolic doctrine; and have been much divided, and no &s;mall quarrellings rai&s;ed among them. But at la&s;t tired with quarrels and per&s;ecutions, and each party being gravelled with what another could lay before his con&s;cience from the &s;cripture, they have in general been taking a new turn about religion. While mul|titudes
<PB N="58" REF="019452_0057_0FABA55AAB5BD698" MS="y">
turn Dei&s;ts, mo&s;t others think be&s;t not to be &s;trenuous as to any point, and to maintain no con|tention, for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they would call the faith once deliv|ered to the &s;aints. This they &s;uppo&s;e is amply com|pen&s;ated by the good opinion they can admit of every &s;ect and denomination. It has become an approved proverb, that men do not think alike, and do not look alike, &s;uppo&s;ing that there is no more evil in having a different belief <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Paul, belief is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s, Rom. iv. 5.</NOTE> than a different face: or in believ|ing that which makes God's word of no effect, or makes him a lyar. So it is commonly thought, if a per&s;on be what &s;ociety calls a good member of it, he will be &s;aved let his belief be what it will. This emboldens men in any &s;entiments, even in the denial of revelation.</P>
<P>While men are thus &s;hewing mutual complai&s;ance to each other, we may be&s;ure they will take liberties with the word of God. Its divine origin is accord|ly doubted by men who yet make a decent obei&s;ance to the public religion. Some not &s;o prudent boldly reject &s;ome parts of it as fancy dictates. And to the bulk of people, the mo&s;t of it is of &s;o doubtful &s;igni|fication, as to lo&s;e all force. The paper, print, and cover may have a &s;hadow of re&s;pect, but as to the contents, this is too deep to be under&s;tood, that is figurative&mdash;that is doubtful&mdash;that is indifferent, and the other is contradictory; &s;o that taking it all to|gether it is the mo&s;t unmeaning, in&s;ignificant book that was ever written.&mdash;And be&s;ides this they have erected a tribunal, upon which human rea&s;on is &s;eated as judge, before whom the words of God mu&s;t be ar|raigned and tried, and tho&s;e only will be allowed to pa&s;s which &s;he allows can be comprehended, and do not cla&s;h too much with intere&s;t and ea&s;e. No won|der then there be gods many and lords many. There are al&s;o &s;entiments many, which could they be col|lected
<PB N="59" REF="019452_0058_0FABA55E46B521F0">
and fairly expo&s;ed would indeed excite the idea of Babel or Bedlam.</P>
<P>Thus we have contra&s;ted with the reception of truth at fir&s;t, the reception it has met with from the nations, when they have meddled with it: While they fail not of loading its betrayers and murderers with honour, one while it is it&s;elf locked up in pri&s;on fa&s;t, another time it is let out to be bandied about like a foot ball, or to u&s;e another &s;imilitude, to be cut up into &s;hreds, and have its force demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Among the fir&s;t believers the divine te&s;timony tore down rea&s;onings, took the heart by &s;torm, and capti|vated every thought to the obedience of Chri&s;t. But on the contrary now, the &s;criptures receive the a&s;|&s;ault, are &s;tormed by men, and captivated to &s;upport their evil rea&s;onings, and countenance their wicked affections and lu&s;ts.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian nations, &s;o called, boa&s;t of &s;uperiority over other nations (whom they call heathen) as Ma|hometan nations glory over them, and the Chine&s;e boa&s;t, looking with contempt upon both. After all the boa&s;ting of Chri&s;tian nations they are much the &s;ame they were before they adopted Chri&s;tianity, only they have new names about religion, and the gods. It is &s;aid that the Roman &s;enate talked of enrolling Je&s;us among the gods. However that be, the name of Je&s;us is only enrolled among the nations. Not to enlarge upon the battles that have been fought in his name while the earth was made &s;lippery with blood. The Spaniards carried his name into South-America, and under it, not only di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the trembling na|tives but cut them in pieces and covered the earth with millions of their carca&s;es. Under the name of Je&s;us, millions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Negroes have been torn from all that was dear to them, and reduced to wear out their lives in &s;lavery and di&s;tre&s;s. Under his name our high mettled Chri&s;tians haughtily tread upon the poor, grind their faces, and extort from wretchedne&s;s its la&s;t comforts to &s;upport a high capari&s;oned go&s;pel. And
<PB N="60" REF="019452_0059_0FABA5604F253668" MS="y">
it is not uncommon to invoke his name to give a &s;anc|tion to earne&s;t pur&s;uits after this world, and hoarding up trea&s;ures by extortion.</P>
<P>As to nations they may be compared to va&s;t col|lections of water moving in a &s;teady cour&s;e down their channel, that cannot be diverted or turned back. The introducing Chri&s;tianity, never turned their &s;tream the contrary way, but in&s;tead of this be|ing perverted and mingling it is carried down &s;tream. It was not the intent of Je&s;us to do more than to col|lect out of the nations a people for his name. Not|with&s;tanding the high boa&s;ts of Chri&s;tian nations, there is the &s;tronge&s;t ground to believe, that the out|lines of the character of both clergy and laity have a &s;trong re&s;emblance round the whole globe; and that there is not more difference in their religion than in their looks or dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Two things may be mentioned, wherein all the nations agree.</P>
<P N="1">I. They all imagine that human worth is of &s;ome avail towards making peace with their Maker. The church motto in di&s;tinction is, He is our peace&mdash; The Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. Worldly intere&s;t is a main point with all the nations. Mat. vi. 32. 'For after all the&s;e things do (ETHNEE) the nations &s;eek.'</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition, the reigning &s;entiment of the true followers of Je&s;us is thus enforced, Luke xii. 33. 'Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide your&s;elves bags that wax not old, a trea&s;ure in the heavens, &amp;c.' Though Chri&s;tian nations are well agreed in the two principal points mentioned, yet in &s;ome others which are called circum&s;tantials they differ. Thus religion may a&s;&s;ume a different garb in different ages or places. Sometimes &s;he appears in a more &s;trait and forbidding dre&s;s, &s;ometimes more loo&s;e and inviting. To cut &s;hort, univer&s;al benevolence, or charity, &s;o called, is agreeable to the pre&s;ent ta&s;te of all par|ties. She ca&s;ts a plea&s;ant eye (however di&s;affected)
<PB N="61" REF="019452_0060_0FABA5615AC4E7C0">
upon all &s;ects of religion, in&s;omuch that a rejecter of revelation, if he declares he cannot &s;ee evidence of its truth, will not meet a &s;evere frown. However &s;he cannot quite conceal her di&s;gu&s;t at a &s;trenuous maintenance of the &s;imple truth. But &s;till &s;he cries, wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leads to the Ely&s;ian fields, and many there be that go thither. This dame with her &s;i&s;ter Univer&s;al Redemption have at la&s;t found a companion in this doctrine, by whom they are made perfect and compleat, and re|ceive their la&s;t poli&s;hing, &s;o that unmole&s;ted they may pride them&s;elves in their charms, revel in enjoyment of their wi&s;hes, and bid defiance to God's &s;overeign|ty, election, ju&s;tification by faith, &s;elf-denial, and fears of damnation, which before occa&s;ionally gave them di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>Finally, the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation, leads to the mo&s;t undi&s;turbed enjoyment of a dream, which men indulged before; though they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with many interruptions in it. It calls to dream without di&s;|turbance, and who will &s;ay it is not plea&s;ant. Many will dream (no doubt) till the &s;ilver cord is broken, and they awake in a world of reality. It is probable, this doctrine will prevail, and contribute much to that quiet men will be in when Je&s;us returns from heaven, 1 The&s;&s;. v. 3. 'When they &s;hall &s;ay peace and &s;afe|ty, then &s;udden de&s;truction cometh upon them, as travail, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>A couple of texts may be here quoted that &s;peak both of tho&s;e who cry peace to them&s;elves, and tho&s;e who cry peace to their hearers, Deut. xxix. 19, 20. 'And it come to pa&s;s when he heareth the words of this cur&s;e, that he ble&s;s him&s;elf in his heart, &s;aying, I &s;hall have peace though I walk in the imagination of mine heart; to and drunkenne&s;s to thir&s;t.' The Lord will not &s;pare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealou&s;y &s;hall &s;moke again&s;t that man, and all the cur&s;es written in this book, &s;hall lie up, on him, &amp;c.' Of fal&s;e prophets we read, Jere. xxiii.

17, 19, 20. 'They &s;ay &s;till to them who de&s;pi&s;e me, the Lord hath &s;aid, ye &s;hall have peace; and they &s;ay to every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart: <HI>no evil</HI> &s;hall come upon you.

<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world is de&s;cribed, Rev. viii. 13. 'Wo, wo, wo, to the inhabitants of the earth, by rea&s;on of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to &s;ound.' The four fir&s;t have undoubtedly &s;ounded long ago; and the inhabitants of the earth mu&s;t now undoubtedly be un|der the&s;e woes. See al&s;o, xii. chapter 12th ver&s;e, 'Wo to the inhabiters of the earth&mdash;for the devil is come down to you, having great wrath, becau&s;e he knoweth that he hath but a &s;hort time.' The &s;hort|ne&s;s of his time wakes his greate&s;t exertions, and wrath. And if we judge from the fal&s;e prophets, the effect of the&s;e is great &s;moothne&s;s, and complai&s;|ance among men; &s;o that the effects of it are before our eyes. God's elect will be re&s;olutely deaf to &s;uch cries, 'Of peace and &s;afety,' as are every where &s;ound|ed, and flee from the trifling combinations of men, calling them&s;elves churches. Jere.

<P N="1">1. The Council of <HI>Lateran</HI> was held at Rome, under <HI>Innocent</HI> III, A.D. 1215. Of all the a&s;&s;emblies, of this kind, which the chri&s;tian world ever &s;aw, this was the mo&s;t numerous.

Among others, the <HI>Greek</HI> patriarchs of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> were pre&s;ent; and the &s;everal patriarchs of <HI>Antioch,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> &s;ent, each, a bi&s;hop, and a deacon, as their repre&s;entatives.

It is read in the Canonical Epi&s;tle of <HI>John,</HI> that "<HI>there are Three which bear Witne&s;s in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and the&s;e Three are One.</HI>"</P>
