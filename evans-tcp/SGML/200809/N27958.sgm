<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I have looked over the following account of my trial: &s;o far as my memory &s;erves me, it is as accurate as &s;uch a publication can be, except perhaps in Mr. Rawle's reply; which without meaning to pay the Attorney General of the di&s;trict, any unnece&s;&s;ary compli|ment, was in my opinion delivered in neater language than is re|ported here: the reporter accounts for this from the difficulty of hearing Mr. Rawle. I am pretty &s;ure there is no &s;ub&s;tantial er|ror in any part of the publication. I have thought it a duty to my&s;elf to add the notes and appendix; the public will judge of their contents.</P>
<P>The Citizens of this Country may learn &s;ome u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons from this trial; and principally, that if they mean to con&s;ult their own peace and quiet, they will hold their tongues, and re&s;train their pens, on the &s;ubject of politics: at lea&s;t during the continu|ance of the SEDITION LAW; a Law, which I do not think "the powers that be," will incline to aboli&s;h. As it is, the plaine&s;t truths, and the mo&s;t notorious facts, may be controverted and de|nied; and the innocent and well-meaning a&s;&s;erter of them, may be driven with impunity, to &s;pend his time and exhau&s;t his finances, in procuring proof &s;trictly legal of what no man in common life pre|tends to doubt. Long before my trial I fore&s;aw this: and &s;tated as an in&s;tance in point, the very ca&s;e of evidence that actually occur|ed re&s;pecting the claim of Robbins. (vide the e&s;&s;ay on the Sediti|on Law, in my political e&s;&s;ays.)</P>
<P>I was previou&s;ly determined, not to be put to the trouble and expence of &s;ending for evidence from Danbury to Charle&s;town; or to be kept under Diony&s;ian tyranny, from court to court, and from term to term, with the &s;word of the law &s;u&s;pended over my head, dependant on the tender mercies of an <HI>ex-officio</HI> accu&s;er to &s;pare the thread. I preferred to ascertain whether the evidence that common &s;en&s;e would not reject, was likely to be admitted on a political trial. I preferred final to preliminary puni&s;hment, nor did I want to &s;uffer the crafty malignant kindne&s;s of a <HI>noli-prose|qui</HI> when my proofs were known to be compleat. Let the reader con&s;ider the danger of uttering a truth, when he finds that I could not &s;ub&s;tantiate the notorious affidavit of Jonathan Robbins, without &s;ending 750 miles for the copy of a record, which Mr. Pick|ering &s;o &s;trangely omitted to procure. Reader, when you have peru&s;ed this trial, &s;hut the book, and reflect. <HI>I dare not</HI> &s;tate the conclu&s;ions with which it is pregnant, but which mu&s;t force them|&s;elves with melancholy conviction on your mind: a&s;k your&s;elf how|ever, is this a fair &s;pecimen of the freedom you expected to de|rive, from the adoption of the Federal Con&s;titution? And whe|ther the Men who can &s;anction the&s;e proceedings, are fit objects of re-election?</P>

<HEAD>PROCEEDINGS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE <HI>Vnited States.</HI> HELD IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, FOR THE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA, APRIL 11, 1800.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Against Thomas Cooper, Esq. of Northumberland, under the Act of Congress, passed July <HI>14</HI>th <HI>1798,</HI> intitled
<Q>An Act in ad|dition to the Act intituled "An Act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,"</Q>
commonly called the SEDITION LAW.</HEAD>
<P>ON Wedne&s;day, the 9th of April 1800, Mr. Cooper was informed by Mr. Hall the Mar&s;hal of the Court, that a writ was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him for a libel. Mr. Hall wi&s;hed to know when it would be convenient for Mr. Cooper to attend at judge Peters's on the occa&s;ion, and the next morning at 10 o'clock was fixed for that purpo&s;e. On attending there, judge Peters &s;hewed Mr. Cooper a paper, of which the following is a copy: The publication of it appeared to be atte&s;ted by John Buyers, E&s;q. of Sunbury in Penn&s;ylvania<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pa&s;&s;ages printed in italic in the la&s;t paragraph, were tho&s;e &s;elected for pro&s;ecution.

<P>I &s;hould not conde&s;cend to an&s;wer <HI>anonymous</HI> &s;lander, but the informa|tion on which the fal&s;hoods contained in the following paragraph are grounded, mu&s;t have been originally derived from the pre&s;ident him&s;elf.

<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P><HI>Thomas Cooper's</HI> addre&s;s to the readers of the Sunbury and Northum|berland Gazette of which he was editor, having been republi&s;hed in this State, with an introduction, approbatory of the piece, a corre&s;pondent wi&s;hes to know if it be the &s;ame <HI>Thomas Cooper,</HI> an Engli&s;hman of whom the following annecdote is related? If it is, every paper devoted to truth, honour, and decency, ought to give it a thorough circulation.</P>
<P>Not many months ago, it is &s;aid, a Mr. Cooper, an Engli&s;hman, ap|plied to the Pre&s;ident of the United States to be appointed "agent for &s;ettling the re&s;pective claims of the citizens and &s;ubjects of this country and Great-Britain." In his letter he informs the Pre&s;ident that although (he Thomas Cooper) had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en called a Democrat, yet his real political &s;entiments are &s;uch as would be agreeable to the Pre&s;ident and government of the United States, or expre&s;&s;ions to that effect. This letter was accompanied with another from Dr. Jo&s;eph Prie&s;tly, who did not fail to a&s;&s;ure the Pre&s;ident of the pliability of his friend Cooper's democratic principles.&mdash; The pre&s;ident, it is &s;aid, rejected Cooper's application with di&s;dain, and Prie&s;tly's with &s;till &s;tronger marks of &s;urpri&s;e, &s;aying, it is &s;aid, as he threw the letter on the table, does he think that I would appoint any Engli&s;hman to that important office in preference to an American?&mdash;What was the con|&s;equence? When Thomas Cooper found his application for a lucrative of|fice under our pre&s;ident rejected, he writes in revenge the addre&s;s which appeared in print, and dr. Prie&s;tly exerted his influence in di&s;per&s;ing this very addre&s;s, which he mu&s;t know was the offspring of di&s;appointment and revenge!!!</P>
<P>The addre&s;s is as cunning and in&s;idious a production as ever appeared in the Aurora or the old Chronicle, and as for impudence, it exceeds or at lea&s;t equals, Porcupine him&s;elf. Prie&s;tley and Cooper are both called upon to deny the above narrative. A recour&s;e to the letters them&s;elves would e&s;tabli&s;h the accuracy of this anecdote even to a &s;yllable.</P></Q>

<P>Yes; I am the THOMAS COOPER, alluded to; luckily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more accurate information than the malignant writer of that paragraph, from whatever &s;ource his intelligence was derived.</P>
<P>About the time of the appointment of commi&s;&s;ioners under the Briti&s;h treaty, doctor Ro&s;s, who had &s;edulou&s;ly brought about an intercour&s;e of ci|vility between Mr. Li&s;ton and my&s;elf, urged me to permit him to apply on my behalf to that gentleman for one of the appointments that mu&s;t then take place. He pre&s;&s;ed on me the folly, as he termed it, of my confining my&s;elf to Northumberland, his earne&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ee me &s;ettled in Philadel|phia, and the duty I owed my family to better my &s;ituation by every means in my power. He &s;tated that mr. Li&s;ton he knew thought highly of me, and though the po&s;t of the fifth commi&s;&s;ioner was probably then di&s;po&s;ed of, there mu&s;t be an agent for the Briti&s;h claimants; an office which from my &s;ituation as a barri&s;ter in England, and my knowledge of mercantile tran&s;|actions,
<PB N="5" REF="037249_0005_100C9CFB82A8F820">
I was peculiarly fitted to fill. I replied that he probably over-rated Mr. Li&s;ton's opinion, and his own influence, and that at all events my known political opinions mu&s;t render it equally improper for Mr. Li&s;ton to give, and for me to accept, any office whatever connected with the Briti&s;h intere&s;ts. That Mr. Li&s;ton and I under&s;tood each other on this que&s;tion, and had hitherto avoided all politics whatever. That being an American I &s;hould not object to any office under <HI>this</HI> government, if I could fairly obtain it; but that I would never con&s;ent to any application to Mr. Li&s;ton.</P>
<P>Through Mr. Coleman's intere&s;t, Mr. Hall of Sunbury, was compli|mented with the offer of being appointed agent of American claims. On mentioning to Dr. Prie&s;tley one night at &s;upper that Mr. Hall had declined it, Dr. Ro&s;s's per&s;ua&s;ions occurred to me, and I &s;aid that &s;uch an office as that would have &s;uited me very well. Dr. Prie&s;tley replied if that was the ca&s;e, he thought he had &s;ome intere&s;t with Mr. Adams, with whom he had long been acquainted, and who had always expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in terms of the highe&s;t friend&s;hip: that as he never intended to a&s;k any favour of Mr. Adams for him&s;elf, I might as well let him try for once to a&s;k one for me. On my objecting that Mr. Adams's politics and mine were probably very different, Dr. Prie&s;tley declared that this &s;o far from being an objection, might be an inducement in my favor; for if Mr. Adams meant to be the ruler of a nation, in&s;tead of the leader of a party, he would be glad of an opportunity to exhibit &s;uch an in&s;tance of liberal conduct. At length I con&s;ented, expre&s;sly reque&s;ting Dr. Prie&s;tley to take care that Mr. Adams &s;hould not mi&s;take my politics. In con&s;equence of this conver&s;ation Dr. Prie&s;tley wrote the following letter; not a few months, but above two years ago.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>August 12, 1797.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear &s;ir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It was far from being my intention or wi&s;h to trouble you with the reque&s;t of any favours, though it is NOW in your power to grant them; and it is not at all probable that I &s;hall ever take a &s;econd liberty of the kind. But circum&s;tances have ari&s;en which I think call upon me to do it once, though not for my&s;elf but a friend. The office of agent for American claims was offered I under&s;tand to Mr. Hall of Sunbury, and he has declined it. If this be the ca&s;e, and no other per&s;on be yet fixed upon, I &s;hall be very happy if I could &s;erve Mr. Cooper, a man I doubt not of equal ability and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of every other qualification for the office, by recommending him. It is true that both he and my&s;elf fall in the language of our calumniators, un|der the de&s;cription of democrats, who are &s;tudiou&s;ly repre&s;ented as enemies to what is called GOVERNMENT, both in England and here. What I have done to de&s;erve that character you well know, and Mr. Cooper has done very little more. In fact we have both been per&s;ecuted for being friends to American liberty, and our preference of the government of this country has brought us both hither. However, were the accu&s;ations true, I think the appointment of a man of unque&s;tionable ability and fidelity to his tru&s;t, for which I would make my&s;elf an&s;werable, would be truly &s;uch a mark of &s;uperiority to popular prejudice as I &s;hould expect from you. I therefore think it no unfavorable circum&s;tance in the recommendation. That you
<PB N="6" REF="037249_0006_100C9CFDC4625080">
will act according to your be&s;t judgment I have no doubt, with re&s;pect to this and other affairs of infinitely more moment, through which I am per|&s;uaded you will bring the country with reputation to your&s;elf, though in circum&s;tances of &s;uch uncommon difficulty, perhaps with le&s;s ea&s;e and &s;atis|faction than I could wi&s;h. With my earne&s;t wi&s;hes for the honour and tranquillity of your pre&s;idency, I am, &amp;c.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>On my expre&s;&s;ing an inclination for the office which Mr. Hall has de|clined, Dr. Prie&s;tley was &s;o good as to offer his &s;ervices with you on my behalf.</P>
<P>Probably the office will be filled, 'ere this letter can reach you: proba|bly there may be objections to nominating a per&s;on not a native of the country: probably <HI>the objection mentioned by Dr. Prie&s;tley may rea&s;onably be deemed of weight in my in&s;tance.</HI> Be all this as it may, I &s;ee no impropriety in the pre&s;ent application, to be appointed agent of American claims, for it is &s;till po&s;&s;ible I may &s;uppo&s;e more weight in the objections than they will be found to de&s;erve. If it &s;hould &s;o happen that I am nominated to that office, I &s;hall endeavour to merit the character the doctor has given me, and your e&s;teem. I am, &amp;c.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Is this the letter of a MAN, or not? I do not appeal to the cowardly propagator of anonymous fal&s;ehoods, but to the public. What is there in it, of vanity or &s;ervility? Do not the&s;e letters take for granted that I am a democrat, though not a di&s;turber of all government; and that what I am I &s;hall remain, even though it be deemed a <HI>rea&s;onable objection to my appointment?</HI> Is this, or is this not, adhering to my principle, whatever becomes of my intere&s;t?</P>
<P>Nor is it true that my addre&s;s originated from any motives of revenge. Two years elap&s;ed from the date of tho&s;e letters before I wrote any thing on the politics of this country. Nor did I recollect them at the time.&mdash; Nor do I &s;ee the objection to taking any fair means of improving my &s;i|tuation. This is a duty incumbent on every prudent man who has a fa|mily to rai&s;e, and which I have already too much neglected from public motives: nor can any office to which I am eligible in this country, re|compence me for the offers I rejected in its favour. But it is not in the power of promi&s;es or threats, of wealth or poverty, to extingui&s;h the poli|tical enthu&s;ia&s;m which has actuated my conduct for the&s;e twenty years.&mdash; The prudence of middle age and the claims of duty may make me cauti|ous of &s;acrificing my intere&s;t, but they cannot induce me to &s;acrifice my principle.</P>
<P><HI>Nor do I &s;ee any impropriety in making this reque&s;t of Mr. Adams. At that time he had ju&s;t entered into office; he was hardly in the infancy of politi|cal mi&s;take: even tho&s;e who doubted his capacity, thought well of his intentions.</HI> He had not at that time given the public to under&s;tand that he would be|&s;tow no office but under implicit conformity to his political opinions. He had not declared that "A Republican Government may mean <HI>any thing</HI>;"
<PB N="7" REF="037249_0007_100C9D00235F9678">
he had not yet &s;anctioned the abolition of trial by jury in the alien law, or entrenched his public character behind the legal barriers of the &s;edition law. <HI>Nor were we yet &s;addled with the expence of a permanent navy, or threatened under his au&s;pices with the exi&s;tence of a &s;tanding army.

Previous to directing the Sub|poenas', he &s;tated to the court, that he under&s;tood it had been cu&s;tomary, and was con&s;idered as a proper practice to prevent any que&s;tion ari&s;ing on the &s;ubject of privilege, that when a member of the Legi&s;lature was intend|ed to be &s;ubpoenaed during &s;e&s;&s;ion, for the court from whence the &s;ub|poena i&s;&s;ued, to write to the Speaker of the Hou&s;e reque&s;ting that the Hou&s;e would permit the proce&s;s to be &s;erved. If that <HI>were</HI> the practice, Mr. Cooper begged the court would be plea&s;ed to conform to it in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance on his behalf.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge Cha&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know of no &s;uch practice and no &s;uch privilege. I do not know that any &s;uch privilege is given by the Con&s;titution, and if it be
<PB N="9" REF="037249_0009_100C9D04223A5440">
not given there, I cannot give it. I do not like &s;etting precedents of this nature. The court will do its duty, and direct proce&s;s to be i&s;&s;ued upon any man whatever his &s;ituation may be, if the law does not exempt him from it: I &s;hall certainly write no &s;uch letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Rawle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe Sir, the practice has been to apply in that man|ner. I believe the Judges of the &s;upreme court of this &s;tate after delibera|tion, determined on the expediency of proceeding in that way to avoid gi|ving occa&s;ion for any di&s;pute on the &s;ubject.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Dallas.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t to the court, that the practice of wri|ting to the Speaker in &s;uch a ca&s;e was adopted to avoid the difficulty that might ari&s;e from the cla&s;hing of juri&s;dictions: If a &s;ubpoena were &s;erved on a member of the Legi&s;latue during &s;e&s;&s;ion, and he did not choo&s;e to attend, the next proce&s;s of the court (if prayed for,) mu&s;t be attachment; and attach|ment cannot be enforced without arre&s;t: But the members of the Legi&s;la|ture are privileged from arre&s;t during &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge Chace.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the court thank you for your &s;ugge&s;tion as Amicus Curiae; but we &s;hould take care to avoid this cla&s;hing of juri&s;dictions. If the member &s;ubpoenaed during the &s;e&s;&s;ion would not attend, we would i&s;&s;ue no attachment, we would put off the cau&s;e till his attendance could be com|pelled. Mr. Cooper may take out his &s;ubpoena's, we &s;hall write no &s;uch letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge Peters.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h it to be under&s;tood that in my opinion, no &s;uch proce&s;s ought to i&s;&s;ue to members of the Legi&s;lature during &s;e&s;&s;ion; for I do not approve of i&s;&s;uing proce&s;s which we cannot enforce.</P>
<P>Mr. Cooper on coming into the court on Wedne&s;day morning (the time appointed for bringing on the trial,) enquired if his &s;ubpoena's had been &s;erved, and particularly the &s;ubpoena directed to the Pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge Chace.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Sir; the clerk of the court &s;hewed us your directions to him, to &s;ubpoena the Pre&s;ident of the United States, and we directed him not to i&s;&s;ue the &s;ubpoena; we thought the proceeding very improper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Cooper.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will the Court have the goodne&s;s to hear rne on that que|&s;tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge Chace.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly Sir; go on.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Cooper.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not expect (may it plea&s;e the court) that any objec|tion would have been made to i&s;&s;uing this proce&s;s to procure the attendance of the Pre&s;ident. It is the duty of every good citizen for the furtherance of ju&s;tice, to give his te&s;timony when duly called upon for that purpo&s;e by the proce&s;s of a court of ju&s;tice. Before I determined on applying for this &s;ubpoena, I examined (as it was my duty to do) the Con&s;titution of the U|nited States, to di&s;cover if any privilege of exemption from this proce&s;s was given to the Pre&s;ident by that Con&s;titution: I could find none; If the the gentleman who&s;e duty it is to conduct this pro&s;ecution, or the court will be kind enough to point out any &s;uch exemption, I &s;hall mo&s;t willingly re|tract my error; but if the Con&s;titution and the laws of our country confer no &s;uch privilege on the Pre&s;ident, it is not in the power of this court to &s;up|ply what they have omitted: notwith&s;tanding the application to the court on
<PB N="10" REF="037249_0010_100C9D070C0DFFA0">
Monday la&s;t, for a letter to the Speaker, proceeded from my&s;elf, I was glad to hear the opinion of your Honour that you would not undertake to confer privileges which the Con&s;titution had not granted: if no &s;uch ex|emption then can be claimed in your opinion by any member of our Legi&s;|lature, why &s;hould it be a&s;&s;umed by the Pre&s;ident? if the Con&s;titution does not give him this privilege of exemption, I may claim the &s;ubpoena as a matter of right.</P>
<P>There is a farther and a peculiar rea&s;on in this cau&s;e, why the Pre&s;ident even if he had this privilege &s;hould not claim it as again&s;t my&s;elf; if I call him into this court, who compels me to do it? Him&s;elf. Who has he to blame for the trouble I may occa&s;ion him by his attendance here? Him&s;elf. The publication for which I am indicted is not a voluntary effu&s;ion, it was forced from me&mdash;I was compelled to write it in vindication of my own cha|racter, gro&s;&s;ly and fal&s;ely attacked in con&s;equence of a di&s;clo&s;ure on the part of the Pre&s;ident, of what I cannot but deem private corre&s;pond|ence. It is from information then, proceeding directly or indirectly from him&s;elf, that I was fir&s;t compelled to appear before the public, and am now dragged into this court to vindicate my character again&s;t anonymous &s;lander and legal accu&s;ation.&mdash;If for no other, for <HI>this</HI> rea&s;on may it plea&s;e the court, in my opinion the Pre&s;ident <HI>ought</HI> to appear. Nor in &s;uch a country as this, do I &s;ee why this exemption &s;hould be granted to one man and not to another. This is, and I hope, will long continue a republican country. A government of equal rights and equal Laws.&mdash;But the privilege now claimed is out of harmony with the&s;e equal principles of republican gover|ment; and I hope the deci&s;ion of the court in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, will author|ize us to believe that no man in this country, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ituation &s;o ele|vated as to be above the Laws, or of any privileges paramount to ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>We have heard you Sir; patiently; and in con&s;ideration of your being without coun&s;el, we have permitted you to &s;ay what we would not have &s;uffered any coun&s;el to advance: Sir, we con&s;ider your &s;i|tuation, but you have totally mi&s;taken the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. It is not upon the objection of privilege that we have refu&s;ed this &s;ubpoena: This court will do its duty again&s;t any man however elevated his &s;ituation may be.&mdash; You have mi&s;taken the ground.&mdash;We are of opinion that in the ca&s;e of a pro|&s;ecution for a libel tending to bring the Pre&s;ident of the United States into contempt, <HI>he</HI> cannot be compelled to appear at all. What? &s;hall you bring the Pre&s;ident on &s;uch an pro&s;ecution, into this court to prove your charges? to a&s;k him, <HI>did</HI> you do &s;o and &s;o? were you guilty of maladmi|ni&s;tration?

<P>The Jury were then called, but before they were &s;worn, Mr. Cooper &s;ugge&s;ted to the court that &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages charged in the indictment were grounded upon certain addre&s;&s;es to the Pre&s;ident in the &s;ummer of one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and nintey-eight, and the an&s;wers thereto; that he had applied to Mr. Rawle to admit as evidence of tho&s;e documents, the publications of them in the common news-papers; that he meant to u&s;e Fenno's paper for the purpo&s;e; that Mr. Rawle at fir&s;t con&s;ented, but had &s;ince written him a note retracting that a&s;&s;ent, that if the court &s;hould de|cide when the cau&s;e had gone half thro, that &s;uch evidence on the part of the defendant was inadmi&s;&s;ible, he would be compelled to move the court to put off the cau&s;e till he could procure the be&s;t evidence, the nature of the ca&s;e would admit of, and which Mr. Rawle &s;eemed to in&s;i&s;t on, namely official copies of tho&s;e documents.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mr. Cooper</HI> addre&s;&s;ed the court as follows,</SPEAKER>
<P>The court may perhaps remember the propo&s;als I made to the Attorney General re&s;pecting &s;ome public documents, which I meant to give in evi|dence as they were publi&s;hed in a news-paper wherein all the acts of govern|ment were u&s;ually in&s;erted: that paper was Fenno's United States Gazette. The Attorney General <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rawle did not under&s;tand at fir&s;t as he afterwards informed me, that I meant to u&s;e Fenno's papar, or he would have admitted it.</NOTE> thought it his duty to object to this kind of evi|dence, &s;ince either from de&s;ign or inaccuracy, mi&s;takes might take place in the publications.</P>
<P>I was extremely de&s;irous at that time to have met the charge &s;ub&s;tantially; the court however, thought Mr. Rawle might in&s;i&s;t on my producing official copies of &s;uch documents as were nece&s;&s;ary for my defence.</P>
<P>In conformity to this expectation, I have endeavoured to procure tho&s;e copies without delay. Much of the &s;uppo&s;ed libel is founded on expre&s;&s;ions contained in certain addre&s;&s;es to the Pre&s;ident in the &s;ummer of one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-eight, and his an&s;wers thereto. On the autho|rity therefore of the ca&s;e of the King vs. Holt, in 5th. term, reports page 442. I applied by letter to the Secretary of State, who returned for an|&s;wer the next morning that there were none of tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es or an&s;wers de|po&s;ited in his office; on receiving this information I &s;ent directly the following note to the Pre&s;ident,

<P>W. RAWLE, Attorney General Began by ob&s;erving that the Defendant &s;tands charged with attempts which the practice and policy of all civilized nations has thought it right all times to puni&s;h with &s;everity. With having publi&s;hed a fal&s;e &s;candalous and malicious attack on the character of the Pre&s;ident of the United States with an intent to excite the hatred and contempt of the people of this country again&s;t the man of their choice.</P>
<P>It was much to be lamented that every per&s;on who had a tolerable facility at writing &s;hould think he had a right to attack and over&s;et tho&s;e authorities and officers whom the people of this country had thought fit to appoint. Nor was it to be endured that foul and infamous fal&s;ehoods &s;hould be uttered and publi&s;hed with impunity again&s;t the Pre&s;ident of the United States, whom the people them&s;elves had placed in that high office, and in which he has acted with &s;o much credit to him&s;elf and benefit to them. Thomas Cooper &s;tands charged in the indictment as follows&mdash;(here the At|torney General read the indictment) It was a &s;en&s;e of public duty that called for this pro&s;ecution. It was nece&s;&s;ary that an example &s;hould be made to deter others from mi&s;leading the people by &s;uch fal&s;e and defamatory publications. There was a peculiarity in the manner al&s;o of this publication; we generally ob&s;erve that per&s;ons who take the&s;e liberties, endeavour to avoid puni&s;hment by &s;heltering them&s;elves under fictitious &s;ignatures or by concealing their names; but the Defendant acted very differently. Being of the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, a man of education and literature, he availed him&s;elf of tho&s;e advantages for the purpo&s;e of di&s;&s;eminating his dangerous productions in a remote part of the country where he had gained influence. Such conduct mu&s;t have ari&s;en from the ba&s;e&s;t motives. It would be proved to the Jury that at the time of this publication, the Defendant went to a magi&s;trate and acknowledged it to be his production in the &s;ame formal manner as if it had been a deed.</P>
<P>A conduct &s;o gro&s;sly improper, had occurred in no in&s;tance within his recollection and the manner con&s;tituted no &s;light aggravation of the offence.
<PB N="16" REF="037249_0016_100C9D13EEF06350">
Indeed it was high time for the law to interfere and re&s;train the libellous &s;pirit which had been &s;o long permitted to extend it&s;elf again&s;t the highe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;erving characters.</P>
<P>To abu&s;e the men with whom the public has entru&s;ted the management of their national concerns, to withdraw from them the confidence of the people, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for conducting the public bu&s;ine&s;s, was in direct oppo|&s;ition to the duties of a good citizen. Mi&s;chiefs of this kind were to be dreaded in proportion as the country around is le&s;s informed, and a man of &s;en&s;e and education has it more in his power to extend the mi&s;chief which he is inclined to propagate. Government &s;hould not encourage the idea, that they would not pro&s;ecute &s;uch atrocious conduct, for if this conduct was allowed to pa&s;s over, the peace of the country would be endangered.</P>
<P>Error leads to di&s;content, di&s;content to a fancied idea of oppre&s;&s;ion, and that to in&s;urrection, of which the two in&s;tances which had already happened, were alarming proofs, and well known to the jury.</P>
<P>That the jury, as citizens, mu&s;t determine whether from publications of this kind the pro&s;perity of the country was not endangered; and whether it was not their duty, when a ca&s;e of this nature was laid before them and the law was applicable, to bring in &s;uch a verdict as the law and the evidence would warrant; and &s;hew, that the&s;e kind of attacks on the government of the country, were not to be &s;uffered with impunity.</P>

<P>MR. COOPER's DEFENCE:</P>
<SP>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>If it were true, as it is not true, that in the language of the attorney general of the di&s;trict, I have been guilty of publi&s;hing with the ba&s;e&s;t motives a foul and infamous libel on the character of the Pre&s;ident; of exciting again&s;t him the hatred and contempt of the people of this country, by gro&s;s and malicious fal&s;ehoods&mdash;then indeed would it be his duty to bring me before this Tribunal, it would be yours to convict, and the duty of the court to puni&s;h me. But I hope in the cour&s;e of this trial, I &s;hall be enabled to prove to your &s;atisfaction, that I have publi&s;hed nothing which truth will not ju&s;tify. That the a&s;&s;ertions for which I am indicted are free from malicious imputation: and that my motives have been hone&s;t and fair.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, <HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI> that the law requires it to be proved as a nece&s;&s;ary part of the charge, that the pa&s;&s;ages for which I am indicted &s;hould be fal&s;e and &s;candalous, and publi&s;hed from malicious motives: and before you will be able, con&s;i&s;tently with your oaths, to con|vict upon this indictment, you mu&s;t be thoroughly &s;atisfied that both the&s;e parts of the charge are well founded. Nor does it appear to me that the
<PB N="18" REF="037249_0018_100C9D19095271B0">
expre&s;&s;ion of the act, to bring the Pre&s;ident into contempt, can be fulfilled if the accu&s;ation, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, related to an examination of his <HI>public</HI> conduct, and no improper motives are imputed to him. And that I have carefully avoided imputing any impropriety of intention to the Pre&s;ident even in the very paper complained of&mdash;that the uniform tenor of my conduct and language has been to attribute hone&s;ty of motive even where I have &s;trongly di&s;approved of, the tendency of his mea&s;ures, I can abundantly &s;hew.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI> you, and all who hear me, well know that this country is divided, and almo&s;t equally divided, into two grand parties; u&s;ually termed, whether properly or improperly, <HI>Federali&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Anti-Feder|ali&s;ts</HI>: and that the governing powers of the country, are ranked in public opinion under the former denomination&mdash;of the&s;e divi&s;ions, the one wi&s;hes to increa&s;e, the other to dimini&s;h the powers of the Executive; the one thinks that the people, (the Democracy of the country) has too much, the other, too little influence on the mea&s;ures of government: the one is friendly, the other ho&s;tile, to a &s;tanding army and a permanent Navy: the one thinks them nece&s;&s;ary to repel inva&s;ions and aggre&s;&s;ions from without, and commotions within; the other, that a well organized Militia is a &s;ufficient &s;afeguard for all that an army could protect, and that a navy is more dangerous and expen&s;ive than any benefit derived from it can com|pen&s;ate: the one, thinks the liberties of our country endangered by the licentiou&s;ne&s;s, the other, by the re&s;trictions on the Pre&s;s: Such are &s;ome among the leading features of the&s;e notorious divi&s;ions of political party. It is evident, Gentlemen of the Jury, that each will view with a jealous eye the po&s;itions of the other, and that there cannot but be a bias among the partizans of the one &s;ide, again&s;t the principles and doctrines inculcated by the other. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance I fear it cannot but have its effect: For without impeaching the integrity of any per&s;on directly concerned in the progre&s;s of the pre&s;ent trial, I may fairly &s;tate, that under the Sedition Law, a defendant, &s;uch as I &s;tand before you, is placed in a &s;ituation un|known in any other ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Directly or indirectly, the public, if not the private character of the Pre&s;ident of the United States is involved in the pre&s;ent trial. Who nominates the judges who are to pre&s;ide? the juries who are to judge of the evidence? the Mar&s;hal who has the &s;ummoning of the jury? the Pre&s;ident. Suppo&s;e a ca&s;e of arbitration concerning the property of any one of you, where the adver&s;e party &s;hould claim the right of nominating the per&s;ons who&s;e legal opinions are to decide the law of the que&s;tion, and of the very man who &s;hall have the appointment of the arbitrators? what would you &s;ay to &s;uch a trial? and yet in fact &s;uch is mine, and &s;uch is the trial of every man who has the misfortune to be indicted under this law. But although I have a right to pre&s;ume &s;omething of political bias again&s;t my opinions, from the court who try me, to you who &s;it there as jurymen, I am &s;till &s;atisfied you will feel, that you have &s;ome &s;ome character to &s;upport and &s;ome character to lo&s;e; and whatever your opinions may be on the &s;ubjects alluded to in the indictment, you will reverence as you ought the &s;acred obligation of the oath you have taken.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI> I acknowlege as freely as any of you can, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a certain degree of confidence in the executive Government of the
<PB N="19" REF="037249_0019_100C9D1AE80FCC60">
Country. But this confidence ought not to be unlimitted, and need not be paid up in advance; let it be earned before it be repo&s;ed; let it be claimed by the evidence of benefits conferred, of mea&s;ures that compell approbation, of conduct irreproachable.&mdash;It cannot be exacted by the guarded provi&s;ions of Sedition Laws, by attacks on the Freedom of the Pre&s;s, by pro&s;ecuti|ons, pains, and penalties on tho&s;e which boldly expre&s;s the truth, or who may hone&s;tly and innocently err in their political &s;entiments.&mdash;Let this re|quired confidence be the meed of de&s;ert, and the public will not be back|ward to pay it.</P>
<P>But in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs, the Pre&s;s is open to tho&s;e who will prai&s;e, while the threats of the Law hang over tho&s;e who blame the con|duct of the men in power.&mdash;Indi&s;criminate approbation of the mea&s;ures of the executive, is not only unattacked, but fo&s;tered and received with the utmo&s;t avidity.&mdash;While tho&s;e who venture to expre&s;s a &s;entiment of oppo&s;i|tion mu&s;t do it in fear and trembling, and run the hazard of being dragged like my&s;elf before the frowning tribunal, erected by the Sedition Law.&mdash; Be it &s;o; but &s;urely this anxiety to protect public character, mu&s;t ari&s;e from fear of attack.&mdash;That conduct which will not bear inve&s;tigation will natu|rally &s;hun it; and whether my opinions are right or wrong as they are &s;tated in the charge, I cannot help thinking they would have been better confuted by evidence and argument than by indictment.&mdash;Fines and im|pri&s;onment, will produce conviction neither in the mind of the &s;ufferer, nor of the public.</P>
<P>Nor do I &s;ee how the people can exerci&s;e on rational grounds their elective franchi&s;e, if perfect freedom of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of public characters be not allow|ed.&mdash;Electors are bound in con&s;cience to reflect and decide who be&s;t de|&s;erves their &s;uffrages; but how can they do it, if the&s;e pro&s;ecutions in <HI>ter|roren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> clo&s;e all the avenues of information, and throw a veil over the gro&s;&s;|e&s;t mi&s;conduct of our periodical rulers.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury,</P>
<P>After having offered the&s;e preliminary remarks, I &s;hall give an account of the paper on which I am accu&s;ed, and then proceed to examine the charges of the indictment in the order in which they are laid: much that I intended to have advanced I mu&s;t relinqui&s;h, that I may not tre&s;pa&s;s too long on your time, or weaken the effect of my own defence by fatiguing your attention.</P>
<P>The &s;cored paper now handed to me by the attorney-general, &s;ugge&s;ts an ob&s;ervation, which, though trite, is material. Upon the plan u&s;ually adopted in the&s;e <HI>ex officio</HI> accu&s;ations, a good Chri&s;tian might ea&s;ily be proved an arrant athei&s;t. "The fool hath &s;aid in his heart there is no God." Take the four la&s;t words and they are athei&s;tical: take the &s;en|tence and it is &s;cripture. So, take the marked pa&s;&s;ages in this paper and they may perhaps be forced into &s;omething like improper imputation again&s;t the pre&s;ident: take the paper it&s;elf, and the very fir&s;t paragraph is a plain and po&s;itive approbation of his intention. Though I mu&s;t acknow|ledge, that however upright I might formerly have believed his motives of action, I cannot upon reflection, pay that tribute to his conduct or his motives on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The general circum&s;tances that gave ri&s;e to the paper I now hold are
<PB N="20" REF="037249_0020_100C9D1CE7392B10">
the&s;e: Dr. Prie&s;tley, a man who&s;e name implies a greater combination of learning, &s;cience, and ability, of important di&s;covery, of exertion for the benefit of mankind, and of private integrity, than any other man now liv|ing can boa&s;t&mdash;who&s;e conduct towards me in the in&s;tance detailed in this paper is prai&s;e &s;ufficient to bear up my mind again&s;t any con&s;equences which the pre&s;ent trial can produce&mdash;had long been an acquaintance and an intimate acquaintance of Mr. Adams in England and in this country. The letters of the latter to dr. Prie&s;tley are full of &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip and e&s;teem. Relying upon this long intercour&s;e of cordiality between them, dr. Prie&s;tley urged me to permit him to write to Mr. Adams on the &s;ubject of a vacancy mentioned in this paper, and which as you will have it before you when you retire, I &s;hall not read at length. This appli|cation was from one friend to another; upon the face of it a confidential communication; although containing nothing but what might do credit to all the parties concerned. Mr. Adams, however, did not think it &s;o confidential; and from &s;ome di&s;clo&s;ure on his part has been founded the ba&s;e and cowardly &s;lander which dragged me in the fir&s;t in&s;tance before the public in vindication of my moral and political character, and has at length dragged me before this tribunal, to protect, if I can, my per&s;onal liberty and my private fortune again&s;t the legal attack of an <HI>ex officio</HI> information. Hence it is evident, gentlemen of the jury, that this is not a voluntary, but an involuntary publication on my part: it has originated not from motives of turbulence and malice, but from &s;elf-defence; not from a de&s;ire of at|tacking the character of the pre&s;ident, but of vindicating my own. And in what way have I done this? My motives, my private character, my public character, were the object of fal&s;ehood and calumny, apparently founded on information of high authority. In reply, I give credit to the intentions of the pre&s;ident, I &s;ay nothing of his private character, and I attack only the tendency of mea&s;ures notorious to the world, which having been known to di&s;approve publicly, I was charged with being ready from motives of intere&s;t, to approve privately. I think, gentlemen, you can|not help feeling this contra&s;t of behaviour, and if the pre&s;ident is &s;atisfied with his &s;ide of the picture I am with mine.</P>
<P>The FIRST article &s;elected for accu&s;ation is, that at the time I allude to, <HI>he was but in the infancy of political mi&s;take.</HI> Why this expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould have been fixed on as &s;editious I know not, unle&s;s it be that <HI>quem deus vult perdere prius dementat;</HI> for have we advanced &s;o far on the road to de&s;poti&s;m in this republican country, that we dare not &s;ay our Pre&s;ident may be mi&s;|taken? Is a plain citizen encircled at once by the my&s;terious attribute of political infallibility the in&s;tant he mounts the pre&s;idential chair? If &s;o, then indeed may it be &s;editious to &s;ay he is mi&s;taken; but before you can condemn me for this kind of &s;edition you mu&s;t become catholic believers in this new-fangled doctrine of infallibility. I know that in England the king can do no wrong, but I did not know till now that the Pre&s;ident of the United States had the &s;ame attribute.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid (and I am accu&s;ed for &s;aying it) "<HI>that even tho&s;e who doubted his capacity thought well of his intentions.</HI>" Is it a crime to doubt the ca|pacity of the Pre&s;ident? Suppo&s;e I had &s;aid that there were &s;ome who did not give him credit for capacity &s;ufficient for the office he holds, is that a crime? Or if in them, is it a crime in me, who have not &s;aid it? Nor can
<PB N="21" REF="037249_0021_100C9D1EF2EAF150">
the word <HI>capacity</HI> here be fairly con&s;trued into any other than a compara|tive meaning; for &s;urely no one who has read his Defence, as it is called, of the American Con&s;titution, or who reflects that he has had abilities enough to rai&s;e him&s;elf to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, can &s;ay that he is devoid ei|ther of indu&s;try or talents. But tho&s;e who voted for his opponent mu&s;t have believed Mr. Adams of inferior capacity to that gentleman. Of that number was I; of that number was <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> one-half of the people of the United States. If it be a crime thus to have thought and thus to have &s;poken, I fear I &s;hall continue in this re&s;pect incorrigible. But if of two con&s;tructions the one is ab&s;urd, improbable and unfavorable, &s;urely it &s;hould be rejected in favour of that meaning which was mo&s;t likely to have occurred, and which in its effects will do lea&s;t injury to a defendant like my&s;elf. This is common, this is legal charity.</P>
<P><HI>Nor had we yet under his au&s;pices, been &s;addled with the expence of a perma|nent navy.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen is it true or not that we are &s;addled with the expence of a permanent navy? Is it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould enter into a detail of autho|rities to prove that the &s;un &s;hines at noon day? But farther, is it true that we incur this expence under his au&s;pices and &s;anction?</P>
<P>I have before me two publications, the one the Gazette of the United States, publi&s;hed by Mr. Fenno in this city; and another in a form more portable and convenient, purporting to be a &s;election of addre&s;&s;es and an|&s;wers to and from the Pre&s;ident during the &s;ummer of 1798. Not having been able to procure office copies of the documents I wi&s;hed to refer to, I mu&s;t offer in evidence &s;uch publications as I can find; that cla&s;s of publi|cations, upon which in fact the mind of the public is u&s;ually made up; and upon who&s;e authority the electors of this country determine the characters whom they honour with their &s;uffrage. Indeed if the opinion that fell from the court this morning be accurate, that no man &s;hould hazzard an a&s;|&s;ertion but upon &s;ufficient and legal evidence, and if documents from the public offices in proof of notorious facts are required as &s;uch evidence, then are the mouths of the people compleatly &s;hut up on every que&s;tion of public conduct or public character: but I cannot help thinking it a fair and rea&s;onable po&s;ition, that a defendant in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this &s;hould be permitted to offer to the jury any evidence that appears to him a &s;ufficient ground for his a&s;&s;ertion, and let them decide on its credibility.</P>

<P>What is it that you &s;ay &s;ir fell from the court? They have not yet decided what was or what not proper evidence for you to ad|duce. The court &s;aid if you thought the public documents at your &s;er|vice you were mi&s;taken. If you undertake to publi&s;h without having pro|per evidence before you to ju&s;tify your a&s;&s;ertions, you do it at your own ri&s;k. Mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly in common traver&s;es you could not offer the evidence you mention. But we acknowledge that in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this greater la|titude may be given. If you &s;ay the pre&s;ident did write a letter you mu&s;t prove it. We &s;hould incline to admit gazettes and acts of public autho|rity and notoriety: you might read the &s;peech of the Pre&s;ident to both hou&s;es of congre&s;s in evidence. If you want to prove that the Pre&s;ident advocated a navy, you may read the journals of congre&s;s or any authentic public document.</P>

<P>Then read the following extracts: An&s;wer of the pre&s;i|dent to the addre&s;s of the Bo&s;ton Marine Society. (Patriotic addre&s;&s;es printed for John and W. Fol&s;om, at Bo&s;ton, 1798) p. 93.
<Q>Floating bat|teries and wooden walls have been my favourite &s;y&s;tem of warfare and defence for this country for TWENTY-THREE years. I have had very little &s;ucce&s;s in making pro&s;elytes. At the pre&s;ent moment how|ever, Americans in general, cultivators as well as merchants and mari|ners, begin to look to that &s;ource of &s;ecurity and protection, and your a&s;&s;i&s;tance will have great influence and effect in extending the opinion in theory, and introducing and e&s;tabli&s;hing the practice.</Q></P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e is the an&s;wer of the Pre&s;ident to the young men of Bo&s;ton.
<Q>To arms then my young friends, to arms: e&s;pecially by &s;ea, to be u&s;ed as the law &s;hall direct let us re&s;ort; for &s;afety again&s;t dangers which we now &s;ee cannot be averted by truth, rea&s;on or ju&s;tice.</Q>
Pat. add. p. 38.</P>
<P>In uni&s;on with the&s;e opinions of the Pre&s;ident the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Stoddart, pre&s;ented a report to congre&s;s early the next &s;e&s;&s;ion (2d Jan. 1799) recommending (p. 1) a navy of 12 &s;eventy-fours, as many frigates, and twenty or thirty &s;maller ve&s;&s;els: in another part (p. 2 and 16) he re|commended an addition of 12 &s;eventy-fours to the exi&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;hment.&mdash; Some of the rea&s;ons given by Mr. Stoddart de&s;erve our mo&s;t &s;erious atten|tion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The pa&s;&s;ages I allude to are the&s;e. Rep. p. <HI>2.</HI>
<Q>Whether this &s;ecurity can be afforded unle&s;s we are able to command our own coa&s;t; and whether the union of all the &s;tates can long be pre&s;erved without it, are que&s;tions that me|rit the mo&s;t &s;erious and attentive con&s;ideration of American legi&s;lators. I forbear to a well on this fruitful, perhaps <HI>delicate</HI> topic.</Q></P>
<P><Q>P. <HI>3.</HI> Thus then, whether our object be to prevent inva&s;ion&mdash;to protect our commerce&mdash;to obtain a &s;peedy and proper peace&mdash;to maintain peace hereafter&mdash; or by affording &s;ecurity to every part of our country, to guard again&s;t the long train of ills <HI>which mu&s;t re&s;ult from di&s;union,</HI></Q>

Surely after the&s;e &s;tatements it will not be denied that our navy is e&s;tabli&s;hed under the &s;anction, not to &s;ay expre&s;s recommendation of the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>In the pa&s;&s;age thus indicted, there is no expre&s;&s;ion of blame again&s;t the mea&s;ure, nor any imputation of improper motive or conduct to the Pre&s;i|dent on account of it: but I &s;corn this &s;ubterfuge of con&s;truction: I <HI>did</HI> mean when I wrote it to imply a di&s;approbation of the mea&s;ure: I thought it objectionable at the time; I think &s;o &s;till.

at double its worth: I &s;hall not therefore detail my rea&s;ons for this opinion, but appeal to you, gentlemen of the jury, if I have the misfortune of dif|fering in opinion with the Pre&s;ident on this &s;ubject, as wi&s;er heads have done before me, whether I ought to be indicted and puni&s;hed for this di&s;|agreement. Our opinions are not in our own power; they are the inevita|ble re&s;ult of &s;uch evidence and argument as we happen to light upon: at all events, let me a&s;k, have I proved the facts as &s;tated or not? If I have, you cannot find me guilty con&s;i&s;tently with the law that has been read to you, or the oaths you have taken.</P>
<P>It is farther imputed to me as a crime, that I have &s;aid, <HI>under the au&s;pices of the Pre&s;ident we are threatened with the exi&s;tence of a &s;tanding army.</HI></P>
<P>I feel it very difficult to prove facts &s;o notorious as tho&s;e I am charged with a&s;&s;erting. Gentlemen of the jury, have we or have we not a &s;tanding army? Is it or is it not &s;anctioned with the approbation of the Pre&s;ident? Independent of his official approbation giving to our mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tary e&s;tabli&s;hment, he has certainly expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf voluntarily much in favour of the mea|&s;ure. Is his reply to the addre&s;s of the young men of Bo&s;ton, pat. add. p. 37, he &s;ays, that
<Q>this country never appeared to him to be in greater danger than at that moment from within or without&mdash;never more ur|gently excited to a&s;&s;ume the functions of &s;oldiers.</Q>
And to the &s;tudents of Dickin&s;on College, pat. add. 240, he hopes, that none but tho&s;e who feel a natural genius and di&s;po&s;ition to martial exerci&s;e "and exertions will ever be called from the field of &s;cience," &amp;c. The&s;e are certainly evi|dences of his approbation of a military force di&s;tinct from the militia; evi|dences confirmed by the repeated official &s;tatements and reports<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The report of Colonel M'Henry to the Pre&s;ident, of December <HI>24, 1798,</HI> and by him recommended to the con&s;ideration of congre&s;s, contemplates an army of <HI>50,000</HI> men, to put us on &s;afe ground.

Without his approbation we could not have had a &s;tanding army, and to the inhabitants of our towns and villages who have eyes and ears, no farther proof than the u&s;e of them is nece&s;&s;ary that we have one.</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure, like the former, I certainly meant to inculpate; and if I mo&s;t &s;incerely di&s;approve it, I &s;hall not hold an opinion unconfirmed by an|cient or modern hi&s;tory, or by te&s;timonies of weight among the dead and the living, who&s;e authority Mr. Adams him&s;elf will not di&s;allow. Is it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me, gentlemen of the jury, to enumerate the many governments in ancient and modern hi&s;tory called republics, which a &s;tanding military force has overthrown, and converted into de&s;poti&s;ms?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Timotheus overthrew the liberties of Corinth; Agathocles of Syracu&s;e; Pi&s;i&s;tratus of Athens, Marius and Sylla, with their contending armies deluged Rome in blood.

Are we our&s;elves unacquainted with the inconveniences attending them, or are the particu|lar objections to a &s;tanding army in &s;uch a country as ours &s;o deep and dif|ficult as to require diffu&s;e illu&s;tration? I think not; I think I may &s;afely venture to tru&s;t to your recollection of recent events in &s;upport of the di&s;|approbation, I certainly meant to ca&s;t on a &s;tanding army in any form, or to any extent, or on any pretence, except perhaps the dubious nece&s;&s;ity of actual inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington, who&s;e opinions every man who hears me will li&s;|ten to with re&s;pectful attention, was a decided enemy of the&s;e kind of mi|litary e&s;tabli&s;hments. In his &s;peech to both hou&s;es of congre&s;s, December 1793, he apologizes thus for having recommended certain mea&s;ures of a military nature:
<Q>Nor can &s;uch arrangements with &s;uch objects be ex|po&s;ed to the cen&s;ure or the jealou&s;y of the warme&s;t friends of republican government. They are incapable of abu&s;e in the hands of a MILITIA, who ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s a pride in being the depo&s;itory of the force of the republic, <HI>and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military emergency of the United States.</HI></Q>
Again&mdash;In that la&s;t and mo&s;t delibe|rate act of his mo&s;t u&s;eful life, his <HI>farewell addre&s;s</HI> to his countrymen, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus&mdash;
<Q><HI>Hence likewi&s;e they will avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e overgrown military e&s;tabli&s;hments which under</HI> any form of govern|ment are inau&s;picious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly ho&s;tile to republican liberty.</Q>
Such are the &s;entiments of general Wa&s;h|ington toward the clo&s;e of a public life that gave him pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">liar opportunities of judging on this &s;ubject.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See appendix, No. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> Nor has Mr. Adams him&s;elf been at all times &s;o favourable as he &s;eems to be at pre&s;ent to the modern &s;y&s;tem of &s;tanding armies. "We have &s;een," &s;ays he, (alluding to England)
<Q>one of the fir&s;t nations in Europe, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ample and fertile territories at home, and exten&s;ive dominions abroad, of a commerce with the whole world, immen&s;e wealth, and the greate&s;t naval power which ever be|longed to any nation, who have &s;till pre&s;erved the power of the people by the equilibrium we have been contending for, by the trial by jury, <HI>and by con&s;tantly refu&s;ing a &s;tanding army.</HI> The people of England alone, by pre&s;erving their &s;hare in the legi&s;lature, at the expence of the blood of heroes and patriots, have enabled their kings to curb the nobility <HI>without giving him a &s;tanding army.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Adams is certainly more accurate in his theory than his facts. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to me that any man can have read the hi&s;tory of England, particu|larly the quarrels between the monarchs of that country and the hou&s;e of com|mons, from William the Third, to George the Third; the various prote&s;ts of the minorities in the hou&s;e of lords on the &s;ubject of &s;tanding armies; the ob&s;erva|tion in Cato's Letters, and the Tracts of Gordon and Trenchard, and yet a&s;&s;ert that there was no &s;tanding army in England at the time the above pa&s;&s;age was written.

The next charge, is that which re&s;pects <HI>the project|ed Emba&s;&s;ies to Pru&s;&s;ia, Ru&s;&s;ia and the Sublime Porte.</HI> Mr. Pickering who is on the bench with the court, can prove the per&s;ons appointed, the date of their appointment, and their &s;alaries.

I have much yet to go through; I feel the effect of interruption, and there|fore without re&s;orting to his te&s;timony, I &s;hall ob&s;erve very briefly in the fir&s;t place, that the obvious tendency of the&s;e appointments, be&s;ide pro|viding for tho&s;e who are nominated to them, is to put us in a way of being drawn into the vortex of European politics and European quarrels, with which we have nothing to do: 2dly. That they are commercially u&s;ele&s;s; the commerce of this country to tho&s;e places does not furni&s;h profit enough to pay the expen&s;es of cur diplomatic and con&s;ular e&s;tabli&s;hments there. 3dly. That they have hitherto produced no national benefit whatever, &s;o far as the the public yet know; and 4thly. I am, as a citizen of this country, a &s;incere convert to the doctrine of General Wa&s;hington in his <HI>farewell addre&s;s.</HI> Hear his words:
<Q>The fir&s;t rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little <HI>political</HI> connexion as po&s;&s;ible; &s;o far as we have formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith: <HI>here let us &s;top.</HI> Europe has a &s;et of primary intere&s;ts, which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence &s;he mu&s;t be engaged in frequent con|trover&s;ies, the cau&s;es of which are e&s;&s;entially foreign to our concerns. Hence therefore it mu&s;t be unwi&s;e in us to implicate our&s;elves by artificial ties in the ordinary vici&s;&s;itudes of her politics, or in the ordinary combi|nations and colli&s;ions of her friend&s;hips or enmities,</Q>
again:
<Q>why forego the advantages of &s;o peculiar a &s;ituation? why quit our own &s;tand upon foreign ground? why by interweaving our de&s;tiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and pro&s;perity in the toils of European ambition, rival&s;hip, intere&s;t, humour or caprice. 'Tis our true policy to &s;teer clear of all permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world: &s;o far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be under&s;tood as capable of patronizing infidelity to exi&s;ting engagements. But in my opinion it would be unwi&s;e to extend them.</Q></P>
<P>Here then, Gentlemen of the Jury, do I &s;tand before you, indicted for being an advocate for the doctrines, &s;olemnly and deliberately recommend|ed to his fellow citizens, by GEORGE WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>But <HI>we have borrowed money</HI> &s;ays this paper of mine, <HI>at</HI> 8 <HI>per cent in time of peace.</HI>&mdash;Have we or have we not? If we have, am I guilty of a crime in making the a&s;&s;ertion? or can you really deem it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould adduce proof to e&s;tabli&s;h this fact? But perhaps Mr. Attorney Ge|neral may &s;ay, I meant to imply a cen&s;ure on the Pre&s;ident for his &s;anction to this mea&s;ure: I did &s;o.&mdash;I think the cau&s;es of the Loan, the mea&s;ures that produced it, had a tendency unfavourable to the intere&s;t of the coun|try: I have already urged what I had to &s;ay on our permanent navy, and our &s;tanding army, and therefore I &s;hall not repeat the objections.&mdash;I think
<PB N="26" REF="037249_0026_100C9D2925C07590">
the loan was extravagant, for in no period of war do I recollect that Great Britain has ever offered this high intere&s;t. I think the intere&s;t thus given improper, as a &s;anctioning of u&s;ury by Government, while our laws repre&s;s it individually, I dread the principles of all Loans; for I abhor a funding &s;y&s;tem and a national debt.&mdash;If thus to think be a crime, I mu&s;t patiently abide the puni&s;hment.&mdash;Nor do I &s;ee why this expence &s;hould have been made nece&s;&s;ary by any previous mea&s;ures, while the &s;tate of our finances was &s;o unfriendly to any expenditure that could have been avoided.&mdash;If Mr. Gallatins book on the finances of this country, be not authority, it ought to be.&mdash;In page 48 and the &s;ub&s;equent pages of that book, you may find that about the time when General Wa&s;hington declined and Mr. Adams ac|cepted the Pre&s;idency, our receipt and expenditures about balanced each other; they were in round numbers 6&frac12; million of dollars per annum. I hold now in my hand the report of the committee of ways and means of February 21&s;t. 1800, publi&s;hed by order of the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of Congre&s;s, from page 15 whereof it appears that the e&s;timated revenue for the year 1800, is only 9,301,258 dollars, while the e&s;timated expence is 15,393,034&punc; leaving a deficiency of above 6 million of dollars! As the ex|ample of borrowing at 8 per cent is now &s;et; time only can &s;hew us how much of this alarming deficiency is to be made up by &s;uch loans, at this enormous intere&s;t. If this be the price of borrowing in time of peace what will be the intere&s;t demanded in a period of war! Is this giving a proof of our &s;trength, or of our weakne&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>This money was borrowed when the violence of official expre&s;&s;ions might have provoked a war.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI> the court will concede that Vattel's Treati&s;e on the Law of Nations, is a book of acknowledged authority: and from that book I will read a quotation or two.
<Q>Nothing is more oppo&s;ite to the duties of humanity nor more contrary to the &s;ociety which &s;hould be cul|tivated by nations, than offences or actions which give a ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure to others. Every Nation therefore &s;hould carefully avoid giving any real offence: I &s;ay a real; for &s;hould he who manife&s;ts a di&s;plea&s;ure at our behaviour when we are only u&s;ing our rights or fulfilling our duties, he is to blame, not we. Offences excite &s;uch a&s;perity and rancour between nations, that we &s;hould avoid giving room even for ill grounded offences, when it can be done without any inconveniency or failure in our duty. It is &s;aid that &s;ome medals and dull je&s;ts, were what irritated Lewis XIV again&s;t the United Provinces, and were the chief cea&s;e of his expedition in 1672, by which that Republic was brought to the brink of ruin.</Q>

<Q>In &s;o civilized an age, it may be unnece&s;|&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that in the&s;e pieces, publi&s;hed on account of a war, all opprobrious words are to be avoided, together with every expre&s;&s;ion in|dicating hatred, animo&s;ity, and rage, as the&s;e can only excite the like &s;entiments in the enemy. A prince, both in his di&s;cour&s;es and in his writings, ought to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t noble decency. He is to re&s;pect him&s;elf in the per&s;on of his equals: and though it is his misfortune to be at variance with a nation, &s;hall he inflame the quarrel by offen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions, and thus deprive him&s;elf of the hopes of a &s;incere reconcilia|tion?

<P>But I have no &s;uch congratulations to make; and it is to me a very un|plea&s;ant ta&s;k to detail, though in my own defence, tho&s;e official expre&s;&s;ions on the part of the Pre&s;ident, which have given undoubted cau&s;e (and in my opinion ju&s;t cau&s;e) of offence to France.

<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI> the&s;e are expre&s;&s;ions re&s;pecting the characters and conduct of the French rulers, and of the French nation, that I am about to quote. I know that reflections have been thrown upon many per&s;ons in this country, e&s;pecially if they are not natives, as too much addicted to French politics. I hope it will not be improper to obviate that &s;tigma in my own ca&s;e: nor do I know how to do it but by quoting a pa&s;&s;age publi&s;h|ed by my&s;elf, when this imputation and this trial could not have been in contemplation.</P>

<P>I do not want to interrupt Mr. Cooper, but (I pre&s;ume from inadvertence) he has read the addre&s;&s;es to the Pre&s;ident as if they were the an&s;wers of the Pre&s;ident. I do not think he wi&s;hes to mi&s;lead, but this is improper, I do not find that the an&s;wer to the addre&s;s of the young men of Bo&s;ton <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Kenyon has decided <HI>5</HI> Term Rep. <HI>442,</HI> that both addre&s;&s;es and an&s;wers are matters of State.</NOTE> contains the pa&s;&s;age he has quoted.</P>

<P>If I have committed a mi&s;take I am very &s;orry for it, but I have committed none: where this language is permitted or encouraged&mdash; where the an&s;wers re-echo or approve the addre&s;&s;es, that approbation a|mounts to an adoption by the Pre&s;ident. For in&s;tance, in the an&s;wer to the la&s;t addre&s;s I read, the Pre&s;ident begins
<Q>Gentlemen, I thank you for this addre&s;s, Your encomiums on the executive authority of the government is in a high degree flattering.</Q>
Sir, I have a right to contend that this retort complimentary, on the part of the Pre&s;ident, is a direct approbation of the language of the addre&s;s. I need not however refer to the addre&s;&s;es at all, for I have enough among the an&s;wers in the twenty other in&s;tances I have &s;elected, compleatly to e&s;tabli&s;h my po&s;ition; not that a few ca&s;es of har&s;h and intemperate language, have inadvertendly e&s;caped through warmth of temper and a &s;en&s;e of national provocation, but that they have been &s;y&s;tematically, per&s;everingly, indulged in.</P>
<P>But I begin to grow weary of this cau&s;e; and I feel di&s;inclined to fatigue

my&s;elf and you &s;till more by wading through this collection of unplea&s;ant and irritating expre&s;&s;ions: nor do I think it worth while to employ my time and yours in contending every technical objection. I did not fully expect &s;uch frequent interruptions, on a trial of this nature, or to have fought my way, <HI>per tot ambages, per tot di&s;crimina rerum.</HI> I &s;hall quit therefore the paper of extracts <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Appendix no. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> I hold in my hand, and quote no more of them. But the&s;e ad|dre&s;&s;es and an&s;wers are not the only foundations of the a&s;&s;ertions I made. The French them&s;elves have complained of this violent language and un|ju&s;t accu&s;ation of their principles and conduct. They have felt the indig|nity, and have expre&s;sly made it <HI>an ob&s;tacle to negotiation.</HI> In page 19 of the in&s;tructions to the Envoys, &amp;c. publi&s;hed by the Secretary of State, in conformity to the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of June 22, 1798, tho&s;e Envoys inform us that
<Q>M. Y. took out of his pocket a French tran&s;lation of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech, the parts of which objected to by the Directory, were marked agreeably to our reque&s;t to M. X. and are contained in the exhibit A,</Q>
(this exhibit I need not read at length: it will be found in p. 24 of the book I am quoting.)
<Q>Then he made us the &s;econd &s;et of pro|po&s;itions, which were dictated by him and written by M. X. in our pre&s;ence, and delivered to us, and which tran&s;lated from the French are as follows: There is demanded a formal di&s;avowal in writing, de|claring that the &s;peech of the Citizen Pre&s;ident Barras did not contain any thing offen&s;ive to the government of the United States, nor any thing which de&s;erved the epithets contained in the whole paragraph.</Q></P>
<P>In another part of the &s;ame page the envoys tell us M Y. informed them that "the directory were extremely irritated on account of &s;ome parts of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech." Now, gentlemen of the jury, that &s;peech is mildne&s;s it&s;elf compared with the extracts I have read, and was prepared to read to you from the addre&s;&s;es and an&s;wers of the Pre&s;ident, publi&s;hed in the &s;ame month with this very book.</P>
<P>In page 92 the Envoys give us a tran&s;lation of the letter of M. Talley|rand, the mini&s;ter of foreign relations, to them. In p. 97 there is the fol|lowing paragraph of that letter.
<Q>The new&s;papers <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix No. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE> known to be under the indirect controul of the cabinet, have, &s;ince the treaty, redoubled the invectives and calumnies again&s;t the republic and again&s;t her princi|ples, her magi&s;trates and her envoys. Pamphlets openly paid for by the mini&s;ter of Great Britain, have re-produced in every form tho&s;e in&s;ults and calumnies, without a &s;tate of things &s;o &s;candalous ever having attract|ed the attention of the government which might have repre&s;&s;ed it. On the contrary the government it&s;elf was inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> upon encouraging this &s;can|dal in its public acts. The executive directory has &s;een it&s;elf denounced in a &s;peech delivered by the Pre&s;ident in the cour&s;e of the month of May la&s;t (O. S.) as endeavouring to propagate anarchy and divi&s;ion within the United States. The new allies which the republic has acquired, and who are the &s;ame that contributed to the independence of Americans have been equally in&s;ulted in the official corre&s;pondencies that have been made public, or in the new&s;papers. In fine, one cannot help di&s;cover|ing in the tone of the &s;peech and of the publications which have ju&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="037249_0030_100C9D327141ECA0">
been pointed out, a latent enmity which only waits an opportunity to break out.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen of the jury, after the &s;erious manner in which the tone of of|ficial expre&s;&s;ions had been noticed by the French nation&mdash;after it was made an avowed ob&s;tacle to negociation&mdash;where was the prudence or propriety of a per&s;evering reiteration of language &s;uch as I have read to you? For my own part, I cannot help thinking &s;uch conduct in a public character ra&s;h and indecorous, and highly de&s;erving the reprehen&s;ion I have expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next and la&s;t point, that which &s;eems to be the mo&s;t &s;erious of all, is, <HI>the interference of the Pre&s;ident in the deci&s;ion of a court of ju&s;tice in the ca&s;e of Jonathan Robbins.</HI></P>
<P>This ca&s;e has received &s;uch full and &s;uch <HI>recent</HI> di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; it has been &s;o much talked of <HI>in</HI> congre&s;s, and written of <HI>out</HI> of congre&s;s, that I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to enter into all the details of evidence and argument which would have been nece&s;&s;ary could I have pre&s;umed you unacquainted with the &s;ubject. I &s;hall, however, prove to you, gentlemen of the jury, that there has been &s;uch an interference on the part of the Pre&s;ident, that it was not only without, but again&s;t precedent and again&s;t law; and if &s;o, you will al&s;o conclude with me that it was again&s;t mercy.

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Mr. Li&s;ton, the mini&s;ter of his Britannic maje&s;ty, has reque&s;ted, that Thomas Na&s;h, who was a &s;eaman on board the Briti&s;h frigate Hermiora, and who he is informed is now a pri&s;oner in the jail of Charle&s;ton, &s;hould be delivered up. I have &s;tated the matter to the Pre&s;ident of the United States. He con&s;iders an offence committed on board a public &s;hip of war, on the high &s;eas, to have been committed within the juri&s;diction of the nation to whom the &s;hip belongs. Na&s;h, is charged, it is under&s;tood, with <HI>piracy</HI> and <HI>murder,</HI> committed by him on board the above-mentioned Briti&s;h frigate, on the high &s;eas, and con&s;e|quently "within the juri&s;diction" of his Britannic maje&s;ty; and therefore, by the <HI>27</HI>th article of the treaty of amity with Great-Britain, Na&s;h ought to be delivered up, as reque&s;ted by the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, <HI>provided &s;uch evidence of his criminality be produced, as by the laws of the United States, or of South-Carolina, would ju&s;tify his apprehen&s;ion and commitment for trial, if the offence had been committed within the juri&s;diction of the United States.</HI> The Pre&s;ident has in con&s;equence hereof authorized me to communicate to you "his advice and reque&s;t" that Thomas Na&s;h, may be delivered up to the con&s;ul or other agent of Great-Britain, who &s;hall appear to receive him.</P>

Pre&s;ident gives his opinion on the &s;ubject of juri&s;diction, and on the con|&s;truction of the clau&s;e of the treaty; and authorizes Mr. Pickering to com|municate the Pre&s;ident's ADVICE and REQUEST that Na&s;h &s;hould be delivered up. Now, gentlemen, without entering into any argument on the que&s;tion of territorial juri&s;diction; or the con&s;truction of the clau&s;e of the treaty&mdash;without going into the point that the crime of piracy gave ju|ri&s;diction to the court here&mdash;I re&s;t my a&s;&s;ertion that the Pre&s;ident interfered improperly <HI>on this;</HI> that if he had authority to do what he did, he would not have <HI>advi&s;ed</HI> and <HI>reque&s;ted,</HI> but REQUIRED AND DIRECTED: an advice may be rejected; a reque&s;t may be refu&s;ed, without attaching blame to the per&s;on who by this language is permitted to exerci&s;e his own judgment and inclination. Either the Pre&s;ident had authority to interfere or he had not; if he had authority, the language &s;hould have been peremptory and not &s;ubject to excu&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eva&s;ion. If he <HI>had not authority he &s;hould not have in|terfered at all.</HI> But it is as evident as language can make it, that the Pre|&s;ident doubted of his own juri&s;diction; advice and reque&s;t is the expre&s;&s;ion of he&s;itation and di&s;tru&s;t; he felt the impropriety of his conduct at the time, and his language bears the impre&s;&s;ion of his feelings.</P>
<P>I might have made enquiry by te&s;timony into the circum&s;tances attending the trial of the &s;ailors from the Hermione before his honour Judge Cha&s;e, in New-Jer&s;ey. In tho&s;e ca&s;es we hear of no &s;uch interference, though I have under&s;tood they were preci&s;ely &s;imilar to that under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: but I really feel my&s;elf too much exhau&s;ted to go into any verbal te&s;timony on this head of the charge, though I had much to examine.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Cooper.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much obliged to the court, and to the gentlemen who have attended; but I &s;hall proceed and fini&s;h as &s;oon as I can.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid this was an interference that the monarch of Great-Britain would have &s;hrunk from. Let the ca&s;e be pointed out if it can, <HI>when</HI> a mo|narch of Great-Britain has made &s;uch an attempt. I know of none; and I know al&s;o enough of the law and of the &s;pirit of that country, to be &s;atis|fied, that no &s;uch attempt would be ventured on there.</P>
<P>It is without precedent&mdash;I &s;ay further, it is again&s;t precedent. I hold in my hands the ca&s;e of the United States vs. judge Lawrence (p. 42 of 3 Dall. Rep.) The &s;ub&s;tance of that ca&s;e is this: Capt. Barr&eacute; of the French ve&s;&s;el le Perdrix, abandoned his &s;hip, became re&s;ident at New York, was claim|ed as a de&s;erter by the Con&s;ul of the French Republic, and required to be delivered up under the 9th art. of the con&s;ular convention between the United States and France, which authorizes the mutual delivery of de&s;erters to the con&s;uls or vice con&s;uls of the re&s;pective Countries, on demand made in writing to the Courts, Judges, and officers competent; and on proof by the exhibition of the Ship's Roll, that the per&s;ons required were part of the Crews. The French con&s;ul could not produce the original regi&s;ter or role d'equipage, but a copy only: this, Judge Lawrence thought in&s;ufficient evidence under the clau&s;e of the Convention. The Mini&s;ter of the French
<PB N="32" REF="037249_0032_100C9D35F913C548">
Republic then applied to the executive, complaining of the refu&s;al, and
<Q>the pre&s;ent motion was made in order to obtain the opinion of the Su|preme Court (of the U. S.) upon the &s;ubject for the &s;atisfaction of the Min|i&s;ter. After coun&s;el were heard in oppo&s;ition to the motion</Q>
the Attorney General (Bradford) in reply premi&s;ed that the Executive of the U. S. had
<Q>no inclination to pre&s;s upon the Court any particular con&s;truction of the article on which his motion was founded, but as it was the wi&s;h of our Government to pre&s;erve the pure&s;t faith with all nations, the Pre&s;ident could not avoid paying the highe&s;t re&s;pects and the prompte&s;t attention to the repre&s;entation of the Mini&s;ter of France, who conceived that the deci&s;ion of the di&s;trict Judge involved an infraction of the conventional rights of his republic, ***** In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e from the nature of the &s;ubject as well as from the &s;pirit of our political con&s;titution, the Judici|ary department is called on to decide. For it is e&s;&s;ential to the indepen|dance of that department, that judicial mi&s;takes &s;hould only be corrected by judicial authority. The Pre&s;ident therefore introduces the que&s;tion for the con&s;ideration of the Court, in order to in&s;ure a punctual execution of the Laws, and at the &s;ame time to manife&s;t to the world the &s;olicitude of our Government to pre&s;erve its faith and to cultivate the friend&s;hip and re&s;pect of foreign nations.</Q></P>
<P>Here then in both ca&s;es, (the con&s;titutional powers of Gen. Wa&s;hington and Mr. Adams being the &s;ame) a foreign Con&s;ul claims a Man to be de|livered up under a Clau&s;e of a treaty. The claim in both ca&s;es is made to a di&s;trict Judge: in both ca&s;es the foreign Mini&s;ter afterwards applies for the &s;ame purpo&s;e to the Pre&s;ident of the U. S. and at this point, the Similitude ends. For Gen. Wa&s;hington did not hazard an opinion of his own or exert executive influence in favour of the application from the French mini&s;ter, but <HI>introduced the que&s;tion for the con&s;ideration of the Court</HI>&mdash;Mr. Adams did ha|zard his own opinion in favour of Mr. Li&s;ton's application, and advi&s;ed and reque&s;ted Judge Bee to conform to it. Gen. Wa&s;hington
<Q>had no inclina|tion to pre&s;s upon the Court any particular con&s;truction of the clau&s;e in the Treaty</Q>
Mr. Adams not only inclined, but indulged his inclination in pre&s;s|ing upon Judge Bee that con&s;truction of the clau&s;e in the Treaty which was mo&s;t favourable to the Briti&s;h claim. Gen. Wa&s;hington deemed it
<Q>e&s;|&s;ential to the independence of the Judiciary Department, that judicial mi&s;takes &s;hould be corrected by judicial authority</Q>
&mdash;Mr. Adams not &s;o tender of ju|diciary honour and independence, boldly &s;atisfied the &s;cruples of Judge Bee by executive authority. Gen. Wa&s;hington
<Q>from the nature of the &s;ubject, as well as from the Spirit of our political Con&s;titution</Q>
left the ju|diciary department to decide the que&s;tion&mdash;The nature of the &s;ubject and the &s;pirit of our political Con&s;titution, were no ob&s;tacles to Mr Adams; he decided the que&s;tion him&s;elf without being re&s;trained by the one con&s;idera|tion or the other. In the ca&s;e of capt. Barr&eacute;, Gen. Wa&s;hington had a pre|tence for interfering, which Mr. Adams had not; for it was the application of the con&s;ul alone that gave juri&s;diction to Judge Lawrence&mdash;whereas the charge of Piracy in the ca&s;e of Robbins brought him compleatly within the juri&s;diction of our Courts, even tho' it had been legally e&s;tabli&s;hed that he was a native &s;ubject of the Briti&s;h monarch. Gen. Wa&s;hington acted in a new ca&s;e; he had no previous deci&s;ion to guide his conduct; he can
<PB N="33" REF="037249_0033_100C9D38AFF56B88">
counter to no precedent of authority, to no ca&s;e in point; no charge of Piracy gave undeniable juri&s;diction: even though his good &s;en&s;e <HI>had not</HI> prevented his interference with Judge Lawrence, the mi&s;take might in him have been forgiven&mdash;But Mr. Adams had a precedent to go by; he had law to guide his conduct? the ca&s;e in point was within the compa&s;s of his information; the example &s;et by his predece&s;&s;or,</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the jury, after the&s;e ob&s;ervations it will be for yor to de|cide whether I have a&s;&s;erted too much in &s;aying that Mr. Adams interfered without precedent and again&s;t law&mdash;might I not have been ju&s;tified had I gone a little farther? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f he did &s;o, it was again&s;t mercy, for the man was hanged.</P>

<P>Is not the whole of the Me&s;&s;age of the Pre&s;ident &s;ub&s;equent to the publication charged in the indictment? If &s;o, how can it be evi|dence? Sir, you had not this evidence before you when you wrote that paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Cooper.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the point in que&s;tion is, the <HI>truth or fal&s;ehood</HI> of the charge. I <HI>had</HI> evidence &s;ufficient before me when I wrote it; &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy my own mind: what if I have &s;till better evidence now? Is the fact the le&s;s true becau&s;e the Pre&s;ident confirms it? The facts had been publi&s;h|ed in almo&s;t every paper of the United States&mdash;they were detailed at length in a publication then before me, and now on the table, by a mo&s;t re&s;pectable member of the Senate, Mr. Charles Pinckney; which I do not offer in evidence becau&s;e I know it will be objected to. Be&s;ides this, I have already &s;tated that the&s;e facts are and mu&s;t be to the jury, matters of recent and public notoriety: they are &s;o referred to by Mr. Pickering in his own report: they have boen given in all the debates in Congre&s;s lately publi&s;hed, and even now daily publi&s;hing; and I have a right, as I think, to adduce this me&s;&s;age, at lea&s;t as <HI>additional</HI> and <HI>corroborative</HI> te&s;timony. But the i&s;&s;ue between us is, TRUE or NOT TRUE; the i&s;&s;ue is not, had I the <HI>be&s;t</HI> evidence at the time I wrote or not. Whatever evidence I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the time I wrote, it is enough for me at this time, to prove that what I wrote was and is true: and the me&s;&s;age goes directly to this point.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury, I &s;ay there are two or three &s;ingular circum&s;tan|ces attending the&s;e certificates. They al&s;o, are far more liable to this objection than the evidence I have offered; for they have been pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice, long after the publication of Robbins's affidavit that he was a native American. The&s;e certificates do not &s;tate that no &s;uch family as Robbins, was known <HI>in the neighbourhood of Danbury,</HI> as I &s;incerely be|lieve may yet be proved. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide appendix No. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> The time of the enquiring into this fact is al&s;o curious: While Robbins was alive, while he claimed (for I again repeat it as a notorious fact, and a fact referred to by Mr. Pickering him|&s;elf in the fir&s;t page of the Report, that he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d claim) to be a native
<PB N="34" REF="037249_0034_100C9D3ACB56D118">
American, no enquiry was thought nece&s;&s;ary: while he could have an opportunity to repel by evidence a counter affidavit, none was made: nay the Judge him&s;elf appears to have thrown the con&s;i|deration of citizen&s;hip out of the que&s;tion.&mdash;But now, when Rob|bins has been delivered up and executed&mdash;when the enquiry can do him no &s;ervice, and he is no longer alive to direct or to benefit by it, it has become an important que&s;tion! The indu&s;try of Mr. Pickering has been exerted to bring us proof from all quarters, from Connecticut to Jamaica: the guarded evidence of the wi&s;e men of Danbury, and the di&s;in|tere&s;ted te&s;timony of Sir Hyde Parker are &s;et in array again&s;t the claim of Robbins. The Pre&s;ident tran&s;mits this accumulation of irrefragable proof to Congre&s;s; our Repre&s;entatives debate upon it; and the citizen&s;hip of Rob|bins at length becomes a que&s;tion mo&s;t material to be a&s;certained<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Why? becau&s;e the affidavit of Robbins, and the impre&s;&s;ion made by Rob|bin's claim mu&s;t be counteracted. But is not the pains thus taken, full evidence of the Notoriety of the claim!</NOTE>; If the evidence I have offered is objectionable, what &s;hall we &s;ay to Mr. Picker|ings authorities? It is well that Congre&s;s is not &s;crupulous about the admi&s;|&s;ibility of te&s;timony: It is well that the evidence contained in the Pre&s;i|dents me&s;&s;age on this part of Robbin's hi&s;tory, was not &s;ubjected to as ma|ny te&s;ts as I have had to combat!</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I do contend that this is not like a trial on a matter of pro|perty, where every technical objection to evidence is admi&s;&s;ible. That evi|dence which does in fact, and ought in rea&s;on, to decide your political con|duct when you are out of that box, is the kind of evidence which ought to decide mine; and it is unrea&s;onable in my opinion on a political trial to re|quire any other; or to harra&s;s a defendant by putting him to the enormous trouble and expence of travelling from one end of the Continent to the other, to bring forward legal evidence of a fact which nobody doubts before hand. I do contend, Gentlemen of the Jury, that there are, and may be certain facts of public politics &s;ufficiently notorious to obviate the nece&s;&s;ity of legal proof, and who&s;e notoriety, is it&s;elf a matter of fact, which may in all ca&s;es be &s;afely left to a jury to judge of.</P>
<P>The affidavit of Jonathan Robbins &s;o often publi&s;hed, &s;o commonly known, who&s;e authenticity has never been &s;crupled, tho' its veracity has lately been denied, is one of tho&s;e notorious facts that fall within the &s;pirit of the preceding ob&s;ervations. While Robbins lived, it was uncontradicted by equal evidence; indeed it is &s;o &s;till: I had rea&s;on to give credit to it at the time I wrote, and I believe in the probability of it now.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have gone through all the charges; and I am &s;atisfied that I have brought in &s;upport of my a&s;&s;ertions, the be&s;t evidence the nature of my ca&s;e would admit of.&mdash;It is true by re&s;orting to Danbury for depo&s;itions and to Charles Town for records, I might have made the evidence in the la&s;t charge, more compleat; but I did not and do not think them nece&s;&s;ary to produce further conviction on your minds, than you feel on the &s;ubject already. This is an important point under the law in que&s;tion. If &s;uch &s;trictne&s;s of te&s;timony is required, there is an end at once of all political con|ver&s;ation in promi&s;cuous &s;ociety.

<P>Gentlemen, if the a&s;&s;ertions I have made are true, whatever the motives of them may be, you cannot find me guilty. But I think it impo&s;&s;ible if you con&s;ider the paper all together that you can a&s;cribe the publication of it to malice: it is on the force of it not voluntary but compelled. I have in the very out&s;et of the paper &s;poken well of the Pre&s;ident: I have been in the habit of thinking his intentions right, and his public conduct wrong: and that this has been the general tennor of my language and behaviour, I believe I can even now bring proof enough from among my friends and my neighbours. <STAGE>Mr. Cooper calls two witne&s;&s;es.</STAGE></P>

<P>This is not nece&s;&s;ary: it is your conduct, not your cha|racter that is in que&s;tion. If this pro&s;ecution were for a crime again&s;t the United States, you might give evidence to your character and &s;hew that you have always been a good citizen, but this is an indictment for a libel again&s;t the Pre&s;ident, where your general character is not in que&s;tion.</P>

<P>I am &s;atisfied.&mdash;I &s;hall fatigue the Jury no longer.&mdash;But re&s;t my defence here.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Mr. RAWLE, in reply:&mdash;</HI></P>
<SP>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury,</P>
<P>The defence you have ju&s;t heard is one of the mo&s;t extraordinary and unexampled I ever remember to have witne&s;&s;ed in a court of ju&s;tice. It is no le&s;s than to call into deci&s;ion whether Thomas Cooper, the defendant, or the Pre&s;ident of the United States, to whom this country has thought proper to confide its mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, is be&s;t qualified to judge whe|ther the mea&s;ures adopted by our government are calculated to pre&s;erve the peace and promote the happine&s;s of America. This, however, does not &s;eem to me the real point which you are to try; and I &s;hall therefore (un|der direction of the court) proceed to &s;tate what <HI>I</HI> conceive to be the que&s;|tion which you, Gentlemen of the Jury are now called upon to determine. Thomas Cooper is charged in the Indictment with having publi&s;hed a fal&s;e &s;candalous and malicious libel with intent to defame the Pre&s;ident of the U|nited States and to bring him into contempt and di&s;repute, and to excite again&s;t him the hatred of the good people of this country. In the act which defines this offence, and points out the puni&s;hment, a liberality of defence is given, unknown I believe in any other Country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rawle forgot that the &s;ame defence is given in England under what is called Mr. Fox's bill.</NOTE> where the party is tri|ed for a libel on the Government. Here, the defendant is allowed under the third &s;ection of that act, to give in evidence the truth of the matters charged as a libel in the publication, and the Jury have a right to determine the Law and the fact under the direction of the Court. The
<PB N="36" REF="037249_0036_100C9D3EA39CBEB8">
true &s;pirit of the Law is that the defendant &s;hall not be found guilty of pub|li&s;hing defamatory writings, unle&s;s they be fal&s;e, nor altho' they may be fal&s;e, &s;hall he be con&s;idered as guilty under the law, unle&s;s the intent of the publication appear to be malicious.</P>
<P>That &s;uch publication has proceeded upon a knowledge of the truth, he is permitted to give as matter of evidence; and if true, it mu&s;t be allowed to go far to &s;atisfy the minds of the Jury, that the malicious motives impu|ted to him are not true. In private actions for &s;lander, where a man &s;eeks pecuniary redre&s;s for the injury his character has &s;u&s;tained, the defendant is entitled to give in evidence as a defence to the action, the truth of the words &s;poken or the written libel; and if the truth of the a&s;&s;ertions be pro|ved, it will amount to a ju&s;tification. There is no difference then between the defence that may be &s;et up to an action of &s;lander, or libel on a private per&s;on, and that which is permitted under the law whereon this indictment is grounded.</P>
<P>The defendant has undertaken to &s;atisfy the mind of the Jury that in this publication he had no malicious intention again&s;t the Pre&s;ident of the Uni|ted States; I join i&s;&s;ue with him on the point, and reque&s;t your particular attention to it. He alledges that he did not impute improper motives to the Pre&s;ident, and attempts to &s;ub&s;tantiate his allegation by referring you to his declaration in the out&s;et where he &s;ays that "I cannot believe him (the Pre&s;ident) capable of &s;uch gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations, for I &s;till think well of his intentions, however I may di&s;approve of his conduct," but to this I &s;hall add that he goes on and concludes with a paragraph, evincing in the cleare&s;t manner a &s;ettled de&s;ign to per&s;uade the public that the Pre&s;ident of the United States is not fit for the high office he bears, and of this you mu&s;t be fully convinced from the whole tenor of the expre&s;&s;ions which have been read to you in the Indictment.</P>
<P>It is very far from my views to pre&s;s hard upon any part of his long ad|dre&s;s to you, or to make u&s;e again&s;t him of any unguarded expre&s;&s;ion, which on more deliberate con&s;ideration he might have omitted or corrected; yet when I cannot but ob&s;erve from the whole tenor of his pre&s;ent argu|ment, as well as from his publication, that his object is not &s;o much to con|vince you Gentlemen of the Jury, that his a&s;sertions are true, as to ca&s;t an unmerited reflection on the general character and conduct of the Pre&s;ident, I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting him of the motives he di&s;claims, and I mu&s;t do my duty by expo&s;ing the de&s;ign as well as the fallacy of the ju&s;tification he has &s;et up.</P>
<P>The defendant has u&s;ed a little ob&s;ervation re&s;pecting the &s;eparating in the indictment the text, from the context, as I believe he was plea&s;ed to term it; and argued that by this means the mo&s;t upright intentions and laudable expre&s;&s;ions might be perverted from their true and obvious meaning. Such an in&s;inuation however is not calculated to influence your minds. In fra|ming an indictment it is my duty to leave out matters of little importance, and to introduce tho&s;e circum&s;tances only that are truly and legally repre|hen&s;ible: and he well knows that he can read if he plea&s;es the whole of the publication, and that you will have it with you when you con&s;ider of your Verdict. You will judge therefore whether by this ob&s;ervation it was his, or whether it is my de&s;ign to confound and perplex the &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="037249_0037_100C9D4056588908">Whether the reflections he has thrown upon the conduct of Government in &s;o many in&s;tances throughout his defence as well as in his publication, evince the regard he profe&s;&s;es to entertain for the intentions of the Pre&s;ident, is to me as it will be to you extremely dubious; nor have tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions been con|firmed by the &s;ingular manner in which he has cited and &s;elected the pa&s;&s;ages on which his defence has been grounded. Throughout the quotations he has made, particularly from the addre&s;&s;es to the Pre&s;ident, and the an&s;wers to them, there has been a &s;eries of mi&s;repre&s;entations which it will be my duty to ob&s;erve upon when I come to con&s;ider that part of the charge and his vin|dication of it. But it is fair to ob&s;erve that if from the peru&s;al of partial ex|tracts and pa&s;&s;ages &s;elected from various publications he has thought proper to publi&s;h a libel, &s;uch as that for which he is indicted again&s;t the character of our Pre&s;ident, there is no excu&s;e for his conduct; if on the other hand he had the whole of the publications before him, and has extracted from them partially and unfairly, his conduct is &s;till more reprehen&s;ible, and there is the le&s;s excu&s;e, as it is evident, and as you Gentlemen of the Jury, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that he is a man of talents and letters.</P>
<P>Mr. Cooper has thought proper to take up the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of his publication in the order in which they &s;tand in the indictment, and in reply|ing to what he has &s;aid I &s;hall follow the order he has pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over the pa&s;&s;ages re&s;pecting the incapacity of the Pre&s;ident, and the infancy of political mi&s;takes as of no great importance, and proceed to that part of the publication which accu&s;es our Chief Magi&s;trate of having &s;anctioned and promoted, a permanent navy, a &s;tanding army, and a loan at the high intere&s;t of 8 per cent in time of peace, while the unnece&s;&s;ary violence of official expre&s;&s;ions might ju&s;tly have provoked a war.</P>
<P>Here then the implication again&s;t the Pre&s;ident is that at the &s;ame time when he was unnece&s;&s;arily plunging us into a War he promoted a Navy, a &s;tanding Army, and borrowed money at an exorbitant intere&s;t, the one mea&s;ure calculated to en&s;lave and the other to oppre&s;s. But Gentlemen, how has the defendant &s;hown this, what proof has he offered that the&s;e are mea&s;ures for which the Pre&s;ident in particular is blameable? Need I recall to your re|collection the Summer of the year 1798 when in con&s;equence of the di&s;grace|ful and in&s;ulting treatment and rejection of our envoys by the French Go|vernment, the Citizens of this Country from every part of the United States addre&s;&s;ed the Pre&s;ident approving his mea&s;ures and pledging their &s;up|port? Among&s;t others the Marine &s;ociety at Bo&s;ton came forward congra|tulating the American Nation that their beloved Wa&s;hington has been &s;uc|ceeded by a Man who treads with equal &s;teps the hone&s;t plain and &s;trait road &s;o &s;trictly followed by that wi&s;e and able &s;tate&s;man.</P>
<P>In this particular ca&s;e gentlemen, with your permi&s;&s;ion I will read the whole of the an&s;wer <STAGE>(reads the an&s;wer from Patriotic Addre&s;&s;es, page 95.)</STAGE>
Now gentlemen I appeal to you, was it not natural and becoming, that in an|&s;wering the addre&s;s of a marine &s;ociety, the Pre&s;ident &s;hould dwell upon the topic mo&s;t congenial to their in&s;titution? Tho&s;e who do not look with a jea|lous eye on every action and catch with a propen&s;ity to blame at every word he utters, tho&s;e who know the character of that gentleman in private life, and who have impartially witne&s;&s;ed his unremitting endeavours to pro|mote
<PB N="38" REF="037249_0038_100C9D43A4F83BC0">
the defence and welfare of his country can &s;urely find nothing but what they may &s;incerely prai&s;e in the an&s;wer I have ju&s;t read to you.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age Mr. Cooper has quoted is from the addre&s;s of the young men of Bo&s;ton: this addre&s;s and the an&s;wer has been u&s;ed for two purpo&s;es to &s;upport; his po&s;ition that the Pre&s;ident had recommended a navy and an army. Gentlemen I will read the whole of the an&s;wer <STAGE>(reads from page 370 Patriotic Addre&s;s.)</STAGE>
I confe&s;s I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find that af|ter the Pre&s;ident had recommended them to follow the "example of their fathers, one of who&s;e fir&s;t principles it was to unite in them&s;elves the cha|racter of citizens and &s;oldiers, and e&s;pecially to pre&s;erve the latter always &s;ubordinate to the former." I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to find that &s;uch an an&s;wer could be quoted as reprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>To arms then my young friends to arms e&s;pecially by &s;ea, <HI>to be u&s;ed as the law directs.</HI> Gentlemen can &s;uch &s;entiments &s;o hone&s;tly guarded, be tortured into proof of the Pre&s;idents intention to plunge us into a war, to introduce a &s;tanding army and a permanent navy? Gentlemen the&s;e are not the conclu&s;ions <HI>you</HI> will draw. The paternal care of the Pre&s;ident has hither|to happily watched over this country, and he knew and wi&s;ely &s;ignified the time when we ought to be prepared for tho&s;e gloomy events, which we had too much rea&s;on to expect. Whether the adduction of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages can &s;up|port the defendant in his defence again&s;t a malicious libel you are the be&s;t judges.</P>
<P>The defendant has read to you a pa&s;&s;age culled from the an&s;wer of the Pre&s;ident to the &s;tudents of Dicken&s;on college, wherein he hopes that none of them but &s;uch as feel a natural genius and di&s;po&s;ition to martial exer|ci&s;e and exertions, will ever be called from the plea&s;ing walks of &s;cience to repel any attack on their rights, liberties and independence: &s;urely gen|tlemen if a moderate and affectionate &s;entiment of this kind, is to be tor+tured into an approbation of a military force or a &s;tanding army, the mo&s;t innocent expre&s;&s;ions are not &s;afe from perver&s;ions. I cannot however for|bear to remark with how little propriety the defendant has complained of pa&s;&s;ages being &s;elected from his publication for indictment without the context as he calls it, when his whole defence re&s;ts upon pa&s;&s;ages thus pick|ed out, to &s;uit the unfair and malicious purpo&s;es of his defence, an epithet which I feel my&s;elf entitled to u&s;e, when I con&s;ider how that defence has been conducted and on what it re&s;ts.</P>
<P>But gentlemen of the jury, the defendant mu&s;t have very little know|ledge of the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances of this country,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Either Mr. Rawle or I, mu&s;t have very little knowledge of the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances of this country. I fear he is liable to the retort, mutato nomine de te fabula narratur. The term &s;tanding army we got from England, when it is applied to a military force in continual and not in periodical di&s;cipline like the mi|litia. In that country there has been a &s;tanding army i. e. a continued military force independent of the militia for <HI>150</HI> years at lea&s;t; the men are enli&s;ted for life and yet the mutiny bill under which that force exi&s;ts is annual. Does Mr. Rawle know or does he not, that in the <HI>5</HI> year-army of this country as judge Cha&s;e would call it,&mdash;the men continue to be enli&s;ted for <HI>5</HI> years from the date of their enli&s;tment. So that at the end of <HI>2</HI> years for in&s;tance, a man is not en|li&s;ted for <HI>3</HI> years but &s;till for <HI>5</HI> years! Does Mr. Rawle know that this is con|formable to the recommendations of the Secretary at war in his report tran&s;mit|ed to Congre&s;s <HI>13</HI>th January la&s;t? and that the recruiting in&s;tructions are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> purpo&s;e?</NOTE> when he talks to you
<PB N="39" REF="037249_0039_100C9D4605FAD2A0">
of a &s;tanding army. There neither is nor can be a &s;tanding army in this country, the appropriations for the pay of the army cannot be made for more than two years at a time, nor has the Pre&s;ident more to do with the army than the Congre&s;s or the Senate,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Yes he had: for the mea&s;ures originated from the &s;ugge&s;tions in his &s;peeches to Congre&s;s, and the reports of his Secretary of war.</NOTE> and the reflections thrown upon your fir&s;t magi&s;trate are equally applicable to your repre&s;entatives. A man &s;o ignorant of the &s;ubject, or who&s;e reading has been &s;o carele&s;s, is very un|qualified to ca&s;t a reflection on the conduct of our government, or to in&s;truct the people on the nature and tendency of the mea&s;ures of admini&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the loan at 8 per cent. if money has been borrowed at that rate of intere&s;t, of which however the defendant has produced to you no proof, it has been done under the authority of Congre&s;s and their mea|&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rawle probably forgot that the Pre&s;ident was authorized to borrow upon &s;uch terms, and conditions as he thought mo&s;t advantageous to the United States; and that the rate of intere&s;t was the mea&s;ure of the Executive Depart|ment.</NOTE>
in this re&s;pect the Pre&s;ident has &s;anctioned as he had a right to do, and as I think (confiding in his wi&s;dom and integrity) he has rightly done.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I do not pretend to be a judge of the propriety of this mea|&s;ure. The Defendant &s;ays no other country has borrowed at &s;o high a rate of intere&s;t in time of peace; but neither is he qualified to judge of this any more than my&s;elf; tho&s;e who are qualified and who have been appoin|ted for the purpo&s;e, have judged for the nation; and I am &s;atisfied as I doubt not you are. But to rai&s;e &s;urmi&s;es and &s;u&s;picions of the wi&s;dom and de&s;ign of mea&s;ures of this kind, which he cannot know &s;ufficient of to explain, or the people to under&s;tand, is evidence in my opinion that <HI>his</HI> de&s;ign at lea&s;t was to excite the hatred of the good people of this country again&s;t their Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The Defendant proceeds to charge the Pre&s;ident with unnece&s;&s;ary vio|lence of official expre&s;&s;ion that might ju&s;tly have provoked a war. Gentle|men, you all of you know the provoking and unju&s;tifiable conduct of the French Nation towards our envoys: the repeated de&s;igns and attempts of this country to procure an adju&s;tment of differences on equitable grounds, and the &s;trange and unexampled propo&s;itions made in return by the Go|vernment of France. It is not for me to dilate upon the&s;e topics, or on the depredations &s;ub&s;equently committed by that Nation on the American Com|merce, you all of you know, you all of you mu&s;t have felt in &s;ome degree the con&s;equence of her inju&s;tice: the Pre&s;ident, far better acquainted with the&s;e proceedings again&s;t America and the tendency of them, made u&s;e of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the &s;tate of the country and the &s;entiments of the people required. Of this he was the be&s;t judge, and I doubt not in this in&s;tance as in every other of his wi&s;e and patriotic admini&s;tration he judged for the be&s;t. The Defendant however &s;till wi&s;er than the Pre&s;ident judged other|wi&s;e, and has accordingly ventured to advance before the public the har&s;h Crimination we are now con&s;idering.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the Defendant has quoted pa&s;&s;ages from the addre&s;s of the inhabitants of Vergennes in Vermont. I have before remarked to you the &s;ingular, and I think the unfair method of &s;election the Defendant has
<PB N="40" REF="037249_0040_100C9D47B8133598">
adopted; and the impropriety of &s;tating the &s;entiments of the addre&s;s it&s;elf as if it were the an&s;wer of the Pre&s;ident and attributable to him. I will read you the pa&s;&s;age <STAGE>(reads it.)</STAGE>
no &s;uch pa&s;&s;age appears in the an&s;wer of the Pre|&s;ident, and whether the &s;entiments contained in it are true or not, they pur|port to be the &s;entiments of others and not of the Pre&s;ident. Such is the way in whick this Defence has been conducted, I will not go through the re&s;t of Mr. Coopers quotations, becau&s;e I do not think they have produced any effect on your minds or on the minds of the Court, which it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to obviate.</P>
<P>The Defendant next recurs to the complaints of the French Government to our Envoys of the Expre&s;&s;ions in the Pre&s;ident's Speech. No doubt Gen|tlemen, it was the intere&s;t and the inclination of the French Executive to rai&s;e up &s;ome frivolous objection to the conduct of our Government that they might have &s;ome plau&s;ible pretext to ju&s;tify their own.</P>
<P>But I am fully &s;atisfied as I hope and believe you are, that the Pre&s;ident of the United States had &s;ufficient foundation for all that he has &s;aid on the conduct of France toward this country, and I &s;hall leave you to judge for your&s;elves whether he or the Defendant are the mo&s;t proper to decide what conduct or language ought to have been adopted on &s;uch provocation.</P>
<P>The next and mo&s;t &s;erious part of this Indictment is that which relates to Thomas Na&s;h, or, as he has been called, Jonathan Robbins. Gentlemen I will read you the pa&s;&s;age in the Indictment <STAGE>(reads it.)</STAGE>
Now Gentlemen it is important for you to remember the remote part of the country where this libel was publi&s;hed, and the cla&s;s of people among whom it was di&s;|&s;eminated, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rawle is mi&s;taken in his ideas of the people of Northumberland county. They are as capable of judging as the generality of the people here. There are &s;ome men there who hold the &s;ame politics with Mr. Rawle (not meaning to include his deputy) of as much natural talent and as much legal ac|quirement, and as ready to defend the mea&s;ures of the government without pay, as he for the fees he receives. But the good &s;en&s;e of the people is a full balance for the combination of talent devoted to the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration.</NOTE> and con&s;ider what mu&s;t be the effect of a&s;&s;ertions thus boldly advanced and &s;trongly &s;tated. Mr. Cooper either had evidence before him of the facts he has a&s;&s;erted re&s;pecting this Na&s;h or Robbins, or he had not. If he had no evidence&mdash;what &s;hall we &s;ay of a man deliberately propagating among an ignorant people, libels of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature and accu&s;ations again&s;t the highe&s;t characters, which if he does not know to be fal&s;e he can|not know to be true? In &s;upport of his a&s;&s;ertions he has read to you the Me&s;&s;age of the Pre&s;ident of the United States on the &s;ubject of Thomas Na&s;h, or rather he has read in detached parts in a mutilated manner the Let|ter of Mr. Pickering: it is ob&s;ervable that he could not have had this evi|dence before him at the time he wrote, and yet this is the only evidence he has offered to the court in his own defence on this part of the charge.</P>

You ob&s;erve gentlemen of the jury, that Mr. Cooper omitted all that pa&s;&s;age beginning with "Provided no evidence of his criminality, &amp;c." This opinion, given by the Pre&s;ident, was confirmed by the vote of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives in rejecting a motion criminating his conduct; and it would be confirmed by Mr. Cooper him&s;elf as a lawyer, if he had duly con&s;idered the &s;ubject, or if his opinions had not been warped by the influence of his political prejudices. But gentlemen, &s;uppo&s;e the Pre&s;ident had not done his duty, as he did&mdash; that he had not directed this Na&s;h to be delivered up, then would the party oppo&s;ed to his admini&s;tration, have rai&s;ed an outcry as loud, and perhaps better founded than they have made already. No conduct of the Pre&s;ident however wi&s;e, no motives however pure, could &s;creen him from the attacks of party &s;pirit. But he has hone&s;tly endeavoured to pre&s;erve the good faith of the country by carrying a treaty into effect, and I tru&s;t he will receive the applau&s;e of impartial and competent judges for his behaviour on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Gentlemen you have attended to the words of this charge in the indict|ment, and you cannot but be impre&s;&s;ed that they convey on the face and in the very tenor of them, a ccnclu&s;ive proof of a mala mens, of a malicious and deliberate intention to injure the character of the Pre&s;ident; no man can read them without receiving this impre&s;&s;ion from the peru&s;al.</P>
<P>I have not touched on the article re&s;pecting the emba&s;&s;ies to Pru&s;&s;ia, Ru&s;&s;ia, and the Porte, becau&s;e I did not think it of importance &s;ufficient to occupy much of your time.

<P>Gentlemen I have no per&s;onal animo&s;ity again&s;t Mr. Cooper, but I have in&s;tituted this pro&s;ecution becau&s;e I thought it my duty &s;o to do, and I mu&s;t make tho&s;e remarks which the &s;ame duty calls forth.</P>

<HEAD>JUDGE CHASE's Charge to the GRAND JURY.</HEAD>
<SP>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury.</HI> (<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">The reader is reque&s;ted to pay attention to this charge: it is accurately taken. Some of the points worthy of ob&s;ervation, I have made &s;hort notes upon; others I mu&s;t di&s;cu&s;s in my letter to the Judge</NOTE>)</P>
<P>WHEN men are found ra&s;h enough to commit an offence &s;uch as the Traver&s;er is charged with, it becomes the duty of the government to take care that they &s;hould not pa&s;s with impunity&mdash;It is my duty to &s;tate to you the law on which this indictment is preferred, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the ac|cu&s;ation and defence.</P>
<P>Thomas Cooper the Traver&s;er &s;tands charged with having publi&s;hed a fal&s;e &s;candalous and malicious libel again&s;t the Pre&s;ident of the United States in his official character as Pre&s;ident. There is no civilized country that I know of that does not puni&s;h &s;uch offences; and it is nece&s;&s;ary to the peace and welfare of this country, that the&s;e offences &s;hould meet with their proper puni&s;hment, &s;ince ours is a government founded on the opinions and confidence of the people. The Repre&s;entatives and the Pre&s;ident are cho|&s;en by the people. It is a government made by them&s;elves; and their officers are cho&s;en by them&s;elves; and therefore if any improper law is enacted, the people have it in their power to obtain the repeal of &s;uch law or even of the con&s;titution it&s;elf if found defective, &s;ince provi&s;ion is made for its amendment.&mdash;Our government therefore is really republican, the people are truly repre&s;ented &s;ince all power is derived from them&mdash;it is a government of repre&s;entation and re&s;pon&s;ibility&mdash;all officers of the go|vernment are liable to be di&s;placed or removed, or their duration in office limited by election at fixed periods&mdash;there is one department only, the judi|ciary, which is not &s;ubject to &s;uch removal; their offices, being held "during good behaviour" and therefore they can only be removed for mi&s;behaviour.</P>
<P>All governments which I have ever read or heard of puni&s;h libels again&s;t them&s;elves. If a man attempts to de&s;troy the confidence of the people in their officers, their &s;upreme magi&s;trate, and their legi&s;lature, he effectually &s;aps the foundation of the government&mdash;(<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">I would a&s;k the Judge, whether if the Supreme Magi&s;trate adopts mea|&s;ures incon&s;i&s;tent with the public intere&s;t, it is not the duty of every good citizen to expo&s;e him to the public? and whether there may not be a Government &s;till exi&s;t+ing altho' the Chief Magi&s;trate and every Member of the Legi&s;lature were changed? what is the u&s;e of Election in a free Government, but for the People to expre&s;s whe|ther their Supreme Magi&s;trate and their Legi&s;lators de&s;erve their further confidence or not?</NOTE>) A republican government can only be de&s;troyed in two ways; the introduction of luxury, or the licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s

of the pre&s;s. (<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">On this mo&s;t extraordinary portion, I would a&s;k, 1&s;t. what Government ever was de&s;troyed by the lincentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Pre&s;s? 2ly. what Government ever was de&s;troyed by Luxury? 3ly. whether a &s;tanding army has not been the principal cau&s;e of the de&s;truction of every Government ancient or modern that approached to a Republic?</NOTE>) This latter is the more &s;low but mo&s;t &s;ure and certain means of bringing about the de&s;truction of the government. The legi&s;lature of this country knowing this maxim, has thought proper to pa&s;s a law to check this licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s&mdash;by a clau&s;e in that law it is enacted (reads the &s;econd &s;ection of the &s;edition law.)</P>
<P>It mu&s;t therefore be ob&s;erved, Gentlemen of the Jury, that the <HI>intent</HI> mu&s;t be plainly manife&s;t; it is an important <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the law, for if there is no &s;uch intent to defame, &amp;c. there is no offence created by that law</P>
<P>Thomas Cooper then, &s;tands indicted for having publi&s;hed a fal&s;e &s;can|dalous and malicious libel upon the Pre&s;ident of the United States with <HI>intent</HI> to defame the Pre&s;ident, to bring him into contempt and di&s;repute, and to excite again&s;t him the hatred of the good people of the United States. This is the charge: The Traver&s;er has pleaded Not Guilty, and that he has not publi&s;hed, &amp;c. with the&s;e views&mdash;he has al&s;o pleaded in ju&s;tification (which the law provides for) that the matters a&s;&s;erted by him are true, and that he will give the &s;ame in evidence.</P>
<P>It is incumbent on the part of the pro&s;ecution to prove two facts, <LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. That the Traver&s;er did publi&s;h the matters contained in the indict|ment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. That he did publi&s;h with intent to defame, &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>For the intent is as much a fact as the other, and mu&s;t be proved in the &s;ame manner as other facts; and mu&s;t be proved as &s;tated in the law of Congre&s;s&mdash;the mere publication is no offence; and in making up your ver|dict, though you con&s;ider them &s;eparately, you mu&s;t take the whole tenor and import of the publication, &s;ince the offence is commuted by the two coupled together,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then as to the publication.</P>
<P>The fact of writing and publi&s;hing is clearly proved, nay in fact, it is not denied&mdash;it is proved to have taken place at Sunbury a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government: It appears from the evidence, that the Traver&s;er went to the hou&s;e of a ju&s;tice of the peace with this paper, whom, of all others, he ought to have avoided. (<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Is it a crime that I do not &s;helter my&s;elf under anonymous &s;ignature? that what I do, I do openly? This man had already been employed as the too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a party &s;ecretly to hunt out evidence again&s;t me: I kenw it. I felt my&s;elf con&s;ci|ous of no crime: was it criminal in me to banter the official zeal of a party runner?</NOTE>) For he mu&s;t know that it was the duty of the ju&s;tice of peace to deliver it immediately to tho&s;e who admini&s;ter the government: He did &s;o. It was indecent to de|liver &s;uch a paper to a ju&s;tice of the peace, and the manner in which it was delivered was yet more outrageous&mdash;if it was done in joke as the Traver&s;er would wi&s;h to imply, it was &s;till very improper&mdash;but there was the &s;ame &s;olemnity in his expre&s;&s;ion "this is my name, and I am the author of this hand-bill" as if the Traver&s;er was going to part with an e&s;tate.&mdash; This conduct &s;hewed that he intended to dare and defy the government, and to provoke them, and his &s;ub&s;equent conduct &s;atisfies my mind, that
<PB N="44" REF="037249_0044_100C9D510041E718">
&s;uch was his di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;For he ju&s;tifies the publication in all its parts, and declares it to be founded in truth&mdash;it is proved mo&s;t clearly to be his publication. It is your bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider the intent as coupled with that, and view the whole together. You mu&s;t take that publication and com|pare it with the indictment, if there are doubts as to the motives of the Traver&s;er he has removed them, for though he &s;tates in his defence that he does not arraign the motives of the Pre&s;ident, yet he has boldly avowed that his own motives in this publication were to cen&s;ure the conduct of the Pre&s;ident, which his conduct, as he thought, de&s;erved.&mdash;Now Gentlemen, the motives of the Pre&s;ident in his official capacity, are not a &s;ubject of enquiry with you. Shall we &s;ay to the Pre&s;ident, you are not fit for the government of this country? It is no apology for a man to &s;ay, that he believes the Pre&s;ident to be hone&s;t, but that he has done acts which prove him unworthy the confidence of the people, incapable of executing the du|ties of his high &s;tation, and unfit for the important office to which the peo|ple have elected him&mdash;the motives and intent of the Traver&s;er, not of the Pre&s;ident is the &s;ubject to be enquired into by you.</P>
<P>Now we will con&s;ider this libel as publi&s;hed by the defendant, and ob|&s;erve what were his motives. You will find the Traver&s;er &s;peaking of the Pre&s;ident in the following words: "Even tho&s;e who doubted his capacity, thought well of his intentions." This the Traver&s;er might &s;uppo&s;e would be con&s;idered as a compliment as to the intentions of the Pre&s;ident, but I have no doubt that it was meant to carry a &s;ting with it which &s;hould be felt; for it was in &s;ub&s;tance &s;aying of the Pre&s;ident, "you may have good intentions, but I doubt your capacity." (<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">This is the fir&s;t time the public have been informed, that it is a crime to doubt the capacity of a Pre&s;ident. Is it not a good rea&s;on for refu&s;ing to vote for a man that you doubt his capacity for the Office? I voted for the Electoral Ticket friendly to Mr. Jeffer&s;on at the la&s;t Election, becau&s;e I doubted Mr. Adam's capaci|ty to fill the office he now holds: I did not then doubt his intentions. I hope I &s;hall have an opportunity of voting again, and the &s;ame rea&s;on that decided me be|fore, will go far to decide my vote again.</NOTE>)</P>
<P>He then goes on to &s;ay, "Nor were we yet &s;addled with the expence of a permanent navy, nor threatened under his (the Pre&s;ident's au&s;pices) with the exi&s;tence of a &s;tanding army. Our credit was not yet reduced &s;o low as to borrow money at eight per cent. in <HI>time of peace.</HI>" Now Gen|tlemen, if the&s;e things were true, can any one doubt what effect they would have on the public mind? If the people believed tho&s;e things what would be the con&s;equence.&mdash;What, the Pre&s;ident of the United States &s;addle us with a permanent navy, encourage a &s;tanding army, and borrow money at a large premium? And are we told too that this is in time of peace? if you believe this to be true, what opinion can you, Gentlemen, form of the Pre&s;ident? One ob&s;ervation mu&s;t &s;trike you, viz. That the&s;e charges are made not only again&s;t the Pre&s;ident, but again&s;t your&s;elves who elect the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, for the&s;e acts cannot be done without fir&s;t having been approved of by Congre&s;s. (<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">If Judge Cha&s;e had read as he ought to have done the Act of Congre&s;s relating to the Loan, he would have found that the rate of Intere&s;t was left to the Executiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and that no &s;ub&s;equent approbation was made nece&s;&s;ary.</NOTE>) Can a navy be built, can an army be rai&s;ed, or money borrowed, without the con&s;ent of Congre&s;s?</P>

It cannot be&mdash;I &s;ay Gentle|men again, if you believe this, what opinion can you form of the Pre&s;i|dent? Certainly the wor&s;t you can form: You would certainly con&s;ider him totally unfit for the high &s;tation, which he has &s;o honourably filled and with &s;uch benefit to his country. (<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">I a&s;k again, is it criminal for me to differ in opinion from Judge Cha&s;e, and to think Mr. Adams unfit for the high &s;tation he fills? What becomes of the ve|ry foundation of our elective rights, if we are liable to puni&s;hment for con&s;idering a chief Magi&s;trate unfit for his &s;ituation? how many people in this country are there, who cannot help thinking thus of Mr. Adams? I &s;incerely believe a large majority. He may be a very good man and a very &s;en&s;ible man, and yet not fit for his &s;ituation.</NOTE>)</P>
<P>The Traver&s;er &s;tates that under the au&s;pices of the Pre&s;ident "our cre|dit is &s;o low that we are obliged to borrow money at eight per cent. in time of peace." I cannot &s;uppre&s;s my feelings at this gro&s;s attack upon the Pre&s;ident&mdash;Can this be true? Can you believe it? Are we now in time of peace? Is there no war? No ho&s;tilities with France? Has &s;he not cap|tured our ve&s;&s;els and plundered us of our property to the amount of mil|lions? Has not the intercour&s;e been prohibited with her? Have we not armed our ve&s;&s;els to defend our&s;elves, and have we not captured &s;everal of her ve&s;&s;els of war? Although no formal declaration of war has been made, is it not notorious that actual ho&s;tilities have taken place? And is this then a time of peace? The very expence incurred, which rendered a loan ne|ce&s;&s;ary was in con&s;equence of the conduct of France. The Traver&s;er therefore has publi&s;hed an untruth, knowing it to be an untruth.</P>
<P>The other part of the publication is much more offen&s;ive: I do not al|lude to his a&s;&s;ertions relating to the emba&s;&s;ies to Pru&s;&s;ia, Ru&s;&s;ia and the Sublime Porte. They are matters of little con&s;equence, and therefore I &s;hall pa&s;s over them. The part to which I allude is that where the tra|ver&s;er charges the Pre&s;ident with having influenced the judiciary depart|ment. I know of no charge which can be more injurious to the Pre&s;ident than that of an attempt to influence a court of judicature: the judicature of the country is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the liberties and exi&s;tence of a nation. If your con&s;titution was de&s;troyed, &s;o long as the judiciary department remained free and uncontrouled, the liberties of the people would not be endangered. (<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">So, provided our Judges are upright, the Liberties of the People would not be endangered tho' our L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gi&s;latures were aboli&s;hed, and we had a heriditary Tyrant on the Throne!</NOTE>) Suffer your courts of judicature to be de&s;troyed&mdash;there is an end to your liberties. The traver&s;er &s;ays that this interference was a &s;tretch of authority that the monarch of Great-Bri|tain would have &s;hrunk from; an interference without precedent, again&s;t law and again&s;t mercy. Is not this an attack, and a mo&s;t &s;erious attack on the character of the Pre&s;ident?</P>
<P>The traver&s;er goes on thus&mdash;
<Q>This melancholy ca&s;e of Jonathan Rob|bins, a native citizen of America, forcibly impre&s;&s;ed by the Briti&s;h, and delivered with the advice of Mr. Adams to the mock trial of a Briti&s;h court-martial, had not yet a&s;toni&s;hed the republican citizens of this free country! A ca&s;e too little known, but of which the people ought to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="46" REF="037249_0046_100C9D5603EBA1B0">
fully apprized before the election, and they SHALL be.</Q>
Now gentle|men, there are circum&s;tances in this publication which greatly aggravate the offence&mdash;The traver&s;er does not only tell you that the Pre&s;ident inter|fered to influence a court of ju&s;tice without precedent again&s;t law and again&s;t mercy; but that he &s;o interfered in order to deliver up a native American citizen to be executed by a Briti&s;h court-martial <HI>under a mock trial,</HI> again&s;t law and again&s;t mercy. Another circum&s;tance is adduced to com|pleat the picture&mdash;He tells you that this Robbins was not only an American, but a native American, forcibly impre&s;&s;ed by the Briti&s;h; and yet that the Pre&s;ident of the United States, without precedent, again&s;t law and again&s;t mercy, interfered with a court of ju&s;tice, and ordered this native American to be delivered up to a mock trial by a Briti&s;h court-martial. I can &s;carcely conceive a charge can be made again&s;t the Pre&s;ident of &s;o much con&s;e|quence, or of a more heinous nature. But, &s;ays Mr. Cooper, he has done it: I will &s;hew you the ca&s;e in which he has done it&mdash;It is the ca&s;e of Jona|than Robbins. It appears then that this is a charge on the Pre&s;ident, not only fal&s;e and &s;candalous, but evidently made with intent to injure his cha|racter and the manner in which it is made is well calculated to operate on the pa&s;&s;ions of Americans, and I fear &s;uch has been the effect. If this charge were true, there is not a man among&s;t you but would hate the Pre|&s;ident; I am &s;ure I &s;hould hate him my&s;elf if I had thought he had done this. Upon the purity and independence of the judges depends the exi&s;t|ence of your government and the pre&s;ervation of your liberties. They &s;hould be under no influence&mdash;they are only accountable to God and their own con&s;ciences&mdash;your pre&s;ent judges are in that &s;ituation.</P>
<P>There is a little circum&s;tance which the attorney-general in his ob&s;erva|tions to you omitted to &s;tate, (<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">In England the Judge is con&s;idered not as the accu&s;er but rather as the advocate for a defendant on a pro&s;ecution; even where he has coun&s;el.&mdash;But I never knew him &s;upply the omi&s;&s;ions of an Attorney General, and argue the cau&s;e again&s;t a pri&s;oner, and dwell upon every minute circum&s;tance of aggravation.</NOTE>) but which I think it right to recall to your recollection, as it appears with what de&s;ign the traver&s;er made this publication. In this allu&s;ion to Jonathan Robbins he expre&s;sly tells you this is
<Q>a ca&s;e too little known, but of which the people ought to be fully apprized before the election, and they <HI>&s;hall</HI> be.</Q>
Here then the evident de&s;ign of the traver&s;er was, to arou&s;e the people again&s;t the Pre&s;ident &s;o as to influence their minds again&s;t him on the next election. I think it right to explain this to you, becau&s;e it proves, that the traver&s;er was actuated by improper motives to make this charge again&s;t the Pre&s;ident. (<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">I never knew before that it was criminal to di&s;cu&s;s the political conduct of a public character to influence the public either for or again&s;t &s;uch public character. Would it be criminal to write a panegyric on Mr. Adams again&s;t the next election? or mu&s;t every man be indicted who does not &s;peak or write in his prai&s;e if at all? I DID mean to influence the election as far as I could&punc; I DID mean, without imput|ing improper motives to Mr. Adams, to &s;tate it as my opinion that he was compari|tively unfit for his &s;ituation. I PRINT THIS TRIAL NOW, not merely to vindi|cate my own character, but to open the eyes of the public to the tendency of mea|&s;ures countenanced by Mr. Adams, and to the &s;trange doctrines advanced by his ad|herents, &s;o that the peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e may be informed <HI>again&s;t the next election.</HI> And I &s;olemnly call upon them to judge whether Trials of this kind do not di&s;grace the admini&s;tration of Mr. Adams; and tend materially to abridge the freedom of the pre&s;s, by puni&s;h|ing tho&s;e who utter what they con&s;cientiou&s;ly believe to be true.</NOTE>)&mdash;
<PB N="47" REF="037249_0047_100C9D57EDCA8CA8">
It is a very heavy charge, and made with intent to bring the Pre&s;ident into contempt and di&s;repute, and excite again&s;t him the hatred of the people of the United States.</P>
<P>The traver&s;er has read in evidence a report made by the Pre&s;ident to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives and a letter written by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate to &s;hew that the pre&s;ident had advi&s;ed and directed this Robbins to be given up; but &s;ub&s;equent facts could not excu&s;e the traver&s;er for what he had written before. (<NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">I appeal to the legal public whether this be law: whether the i&s;&s;ue being TRUE or not TRUE, any competent evidence to prove the truth, does not go to i&s;&s;ue.</NOTE>)</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, with regard to this delivery of Jonathan Robbins, I am clearly of opinion that the Pre&s;ident could not refu&s;e to deliver him up. This &s;ame Jonathan Robbins, who&s;e real name appears to have been Na&s;h, (<NOTE N="M" PLACE="foot">How does the Judge know this? is there any thing like <HI>proof</HI> of this in the Pre&s;ident's Me&s;&s;age?

Through|out the whole of Mr Rawle's reply, and the Judge's charge, a number of political and other facts are taken for granted <HI>upon the ground of notoriety,</HI> of which not a particle the of evidence appeared on the trial.</NOTE>) was charged with murder committed on board the Hermione Briti&s;h &s;hip of war. This Na&s;h being di&s;covered in America, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter made a requi&s;ition to the Pre&s;ident that he &s;hould be delivered up. Then we mu&s;t enquire whether the Pre&s;ident was obliged to give him up? By the 27th article of the treaty with Great-Britain, it is &s;tipulated,
<Q>that either of the contracting parties will deliver up to ju&s;tice all per&s;ons who being charged with murder or forgery committed within the juri&s;|diction of either, &s;hall &s;eek an a&s;ylum within any of the countries of the other, provided this &s;hall be done only on &s;uch evidence of criminality as according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or per&s;on &s;o charged &s;hall be found, would ju&s;tify his apprehen&s;ion and commitment for trial, if the offence had been there committed.</Q>
If the Pre&s;ident therefore, by this treaty was bound to give this Na&s;h up to ju&s;tice he was &s;o bound by law; for the treaty is the law of the land: if &s;o, the charge of interference to influence the deci&s;ions of a court of ju&s;tice, is without foundation: the rea&s;on why this article was in&s;erted in the treaty is evident &mdash;Murder is a crime again&s;t the laws of God and man, and ought never to be committed with impunity. Forgery is an offence affecting all commer|cial countries, and &s;hould never go unpuni&s;hed; and therefore every go|vernment, e&s;pecially a commercial one, acts wi&s;ely in delivering fugitives guilty of &s;uch crimes to ju&s;tice. Na&s;h was charged with having committed murder on board a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war: now a di&s;pute has ari&s;en whether murder (<NOTE N="N" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall take an opportunity pre&s;ently of recalling to the Judge's recollec|tion what <HI>he ought</HI> to have &s;tated to the jury, that the charge was piracy as well as murder.</NOTE>) committed on board &s;uch a &s;hip of war was committed within the juri&s;diction of Great-Britain, I have no doubt as to the point.&mdash; All ve&s;&s;els, whether public or private, are part of the territory and within the juri&s;diction of the nation to which they belong. This is according to the law of nations.&mdash;All nations have this juri&s;diction, and the rea&s;on is
<PB N="48" REF="037249_0048_100C9D59CA642800">
obvious, for every country carrying on commerce is an&s;werable to other nations for the conduct of their &s;ubjects on the ocean. Were it not &s;o, crimes committed on board ve&s;&s;els of war would go unpuni&s;hed; for no other country can claim juri&s;diction. This per&s;on then was charged with murder committed on board a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war. I &s;ay it was committed within the juri&s;diction of Great Britain. By the con&s;titution (&s;ince the treaty is the law of the land) America was bound to give him up: but who is the per&s;on to deliver up a fugitive according to that article in the treaty? The pre&s;ident was the only per&s;on to take the proper &s;teps and to take cog|nizance of the bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;He repre&s;ents the United States in their concerns with foreign powers: this affair could not be tried before a court of law&mdash; No court of ju&s;tice here has juri&s;diction over the crime of murder commit|ted on board a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war. Now, as a requi&s;ition was made to the Pre&s;ident on the part of the Briti&s;h government to deliver this man up, it became nece&s;&s;ary to know whether there was &s;ufficient evidence of his cri|minality pur&s;uant to the treaty.&mdash;The judge of the court of Carolina was therefore called upon to inquire into the evidence of his criminality: he was the in&s;trument made u&s;e of by the Pre&s;ident to a&s;certain that fact: (<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Is this true? D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Pre&s;ident in the fir&s;t in&s;tance direct Judge Bee to a&s;certain that fact? But Judge Cha&s;e perhaps means this con&s;tructively: but is this true? For was it deemed his duty by Judge Bee, or was it required by the Pre&s;ident that the fact thus a&s;certained &s;hould be tran&s;mitted? No: the application of Mr. Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n &s;ugge&s;ted the conduct of the Pre&s;ident.</NOTE>) his delivery was the nece&s;&s;ary act of the Pre&s;ident which he was by the treaty and the law of the land bound to perform; and had he not done &s;o, we &s;hould have heard louder complaints from that party who are ince&s;&s;antly oppo&s;ing and calumniating the government, that the Pre&s;ident had gro&s;sly neglected his duty by not carrying a &s;olemn treaty into effect. Was this then an interference on the part of the Pre&s;ident with the judi|ciary without precedent, again&s;t law and again&s;t mercy; for doing an act which he was bound by the law of the land to carry into effect and over which a court of ju&s;tice had no juri&s;diction? (<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Yet the Supreme Court &s;eems to have thought otherwi&s;e in the United States, vs. Judge Laurence.</NOTE>) Surely not; neither has it merited to be treated in the manner in which the traver&s;er has done in his publication&mdash;A defence of greater novelty I never heard before.</P>
<P>Take this publication in all its parts, and it is the bolde&s;t attempt I have known to poi&s;on the minds of the people. He a&s;&s;erts that Mr. Adams has countenanced a Navy, that he has brought forward mea&s;ures for rai&s;ing a &s;tanding army in the country.&mdash;The traver&s;er is certainly a &s;cholar, and has &s;hewn him&s;elf a man of learning, and has read much on the &s;ubject of armies. But to a&s;&s;ert, as he has done, that we have a &s;tanding army in this country, betrays the mo&s;t egregious ignorance, or the mo&s;t wilful inten|tions to deceive the public. (<NOTE N="Q" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall con&s;ider th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e a&s;&s;ertions pre&s;ently.</NOTE>) We have two de&s;criptions of armies in this country&mdash;we have an army which is generally called the We&s;tern army, enli&s;ted for five years only&mdash;can this be a &s;tanding army? Who rai&s;es them? Congre&s;s. Who pays them? The people. We have al&s;o another army, called the provi&s;ional army which is enli&s;ted during the exi&s;tence of the war with France&mdash;neither of the&s;e can with any propriety
<PB N="49" REF="037249_0049_100C9D5BEDD11C58">
be called a &s;tanding army&mdash;In fact we cannot have a &s;tanding army in this country, the Con&s;titution having expre&s;sly declared that no appropriation &s;hall be made for the &s;upport of an army longer than two years&mdash;There|fore as Congre&s;s may appropriate money for the &s;upport of the army annu|ally and are obliged to do it only for two years, there can be no &s;tanding army in this country until the Con&s;titution is fir&s;t de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ubject on which the people of America feel more alarm&punc; than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;tanding army. Once per&s;uade them that the government is attempting to promote &s;uch a mea&s;ure, and you de&s;troy their confidence in the government. Therefore to &s;ay, that under the au&s;pices of the Pre&s;ident, we were &s;addled with a &s;tanding army, was directly calculated to bring him into contempt with the people, and excite their hatred again&s;t him.</P>
<P>It is too much to pre&s;s this point on the Traver&s;er. But he de&s;erves it. This publication is evidently intented to mi&s;lead the ignorant, and inflame their minds again&s;t the Pre&s;ident, and to influence their votes on the next election.</P>
<P>The Traver&s;er &s;ays, he has proved that the Pre&s;ident has advocated a &s;tanding army&mdash;how has he proved it? There is no &s;tanding army; I have before &s;tated the army is only rai&s;ed for five years, and during the exi&s;ting differences&mdash;He tells you, Mr. Adams is a friend to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a navy&mdash;I wonder who is not a friend to a navy which is to pro|tect the commerce and power of this country.</P>
<P>The Traver&s;er has, to prove the&s;e points, read to you many extracts from the addre&s;&s;es and an&s;wers to the Pre&s;ident. He has &s;elected a number of pa&s;&s;ages which he a&s;&s;erts, prove the approbation of the Pre&s;ident to the creation of a navy, and forming a &s;tanding army. But we are to recollect gentlemen, that when in con&s;equence of the unju&s;t proceeding of France, the great ma&s;s of the people thought proper to addre&s;s the Pre&s;ident, ex|pre&s;&s;ing in tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es &s;entiments of attachment and confidence in the Pre&s;ident, and their determination to refill the oppre&s;&s;ion of the French government: the Pre&s;ident replied to them in an&s;wers which generally were the echo of their &s;entiments, and in fact his expre&s;&s;ions were as gene|ral as the nature of the addre&s;&s;es would permit&mdash;Therefore the Traver&s;er ought to have blamed the addre&s;&s;ers, and not the Pre&s;ident. The Marine Society of Bo&s;ton, as old &s;eamen, addre&s;s the Pre&s;ident in favour of a navy, the Pre&s;ident in reply thinks a navy is the proper defence of the country.</P>
<P>I believe, gentlemen, in the fir&s;t part of my charge I made remarks on the a&s;&s;ertions of the Traver&s;er, that the Pre&s;ident had borrowed momey at 8 per cent. in time of peace. Therefore it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge on that point.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to notice, gentlemen, that the Traver&s;er in his defence mu&s;t prove every charge he has made to be true; he mu&s;t prove it to the marrow. If he a&s;&s;erts three things, and proves but one, he fails&mdash;If he proves but two, he fails in his defence, for he mu&s;t prove the whole of his a&s;&s;ertions to be true. If he were to prove that the Pre&s;ident had done every thing charged again&s;t him in the fir&s;t paragraph of the publication&mdash; though he &s;hould prove to your &s;atisfaction, that the Pre&s;ident had in|terfered

to influence the deci&s;ions of a court of ju&s;tice, that he had deliver|ed up Jonathan Robbins without precedent, again&s;t law and again&s;t mercy, this would not be &s;ufficient, unle&s;s he proved at the &s;ame time, that Jonathan Robbins was a native American, and had been forcibly impre&s;&s;ed, and compelled to &s;erve on board a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war.&mdash;If he fails there|fore, gentlemen, in this proof, you mu&s;t then con&s;ider w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ether his inten|tion in making the&s;e charges again&s;t the Pre&s;ident were malicious or not&mdash; It is not nece&s;&s;ary for me to go more minutely into an inve&s;tigation of the defence.

<SPEAKER>Mr. Cooper.</SPEAKER>
<P>The court have de&s;ired me to offer any thing relating to my circum&s;tances in mitigation of the fine, or any ob&s;ervation that occurs to me in extenuation of the offence. I have thought it my duty (not for the pur|po&s;e of deprecating any puni&s;hment which the court may deem it proper to inflict, but) to prevent any accidental or apparent har&s;hne&s;s of puni&s;hment on part of the court, for want of that information which it is in my power to give. For this rea&s;on therefore, and that the court may not be mi&s;led, I think it right to &s;ay that my property in this country is moderate. That &s;ome re&s;ources I had in England, commercial failures there, have lately cut off: that I depend principally on my practice: that practice impri&s;on|ment will annihilate. Be it &s;o. I have been accu&s;tomed to make &s;acrifices to opinion, and I can make this.

<P>If we were to indulge our own ideas, there is room to &s;u&s;pect that in ca&s;es of this kind, where one party is again&s;t the govern|ment, gentlemen who write for that party would be indemnified again&s;t any pecuniary lo&s;s; and that the party &s;hould pay any fine which might be impo&s;ed on the per&s;on convicted.

I under&s;tand you have a family, but you have not thought proper to &s;tate that to the court. From what I can gather from you, it appears, that you depend on your profe&s;&s;ion for &s;upport&mdash;we do not wi&s;h to impo&s;e &s;o rigorous a fine as to be beyond a per|&s;ons abilities to &s;upport, but the government mu&s;t be &s;ecured again&s;t the&s;e malicious attacks. You &s;ay that you are not con&s;cious of having acted from malicious motives. It may be &s;o; &s;aying &s;o, we mu&s;t believe you&mdash; but the jury have found otherwi&s;e: you are a gentleman of the profe&s;&s;ion, of &s;uch capacity and knowledge, as to have it more in your power to mi&s;|lead the ignorant.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Cooper.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been a&s;ked by the court whether in ca&s;e of a fine being impo&s;ed upon me, I &s;hall be &s;upported by a party&mdash;Sir I &s;olemnly aver that throughout my life, here and el&s;ewhere, among all the political que&s;tions in which I have been concerned, I have never &s;o far demeaned my&s;elf as to be a party writer. I never was in the pay, or under the &s;up|port of any party&mdash;there is no party in this or any other country, that can offer me a temptation to pro&s;titute my pen.&mdash;If there are any per&s;ons here who are acquainted with what I have publi&s;hed, they mu&s;t feel and be &s;a|tisfied that I have had higher and better motives, than a party could &s;ugge&s;t. I have written to the be&s;t of my ability, what I have &s;eriou&s;ly thought would conduce to the general good of mankind. The exertions of my ta|lents &s;uch as they are, have been unbought, and &s;o they &s;hall continue&mdash; they have indeed been paid for, but they have been paid for by my&s;elf, and by my&s;elf only, and &s;ometimes dearly. The public is my debtor, and what I have paid or &s;uffered for them, if my duty &s;hould again call upon me to write or to act, I &s;hall again mo&s;t readily &s;ubmit to. I do not pre|tend to have no party opinions, to have no predilection for particular de|&s;ciptions of men or of mea&s;ures; but I do not act upon minor con&s;idera|tions: I belong here as in my former country to the great party of man|kind. With regard to any offers which may have been made to me to enable me to di&s;charge the fine which may be impo&s;ed, I will &s;tate candid|ly to the court what has pa&s;&s;ed, for I wi&s;h not to conceal the truth: I have had no previous communication or promi&s;e whatever, I have &s;ince had no &s;pecific promi&s;es of money or any thing el&s;e. I wrote from my own &s;ug|ge&s;tions. But many of my friends have in the expectation of a verdict
<PB N="52" REF="037249_0052_100C9D612DA11378">
again&s;t me, come forward with general offers of pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance: the&s;e offers I have hitherto neither accepted nor rejected. If the court &s;hould impo&s;e a fine beyond my ability to pay, I &s;hall accept them without he&s;itation, but if the fine be within my circum&s;tances to di&s;charge. I &s;hall pay it my&s;elf: But the in&s;inuations of the court are ill founded, and if you &s;ir, from mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, or mi&s;information have been tempted to make them, your mi&s;take &s;hould be corrected.</P>

I &s;hall only con&s;ider your circum&s;tances, and impo&s;e a fine which I think adequate; we ought to avoid any oppre&s;&s;ion. It appears that you depend chiefly upon your profe&s;&s;ion for &s;upport.

<P>The introduction 6th. page. It is the intention of the pre&s;ent attempt to &s;ugge&s;t the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> efficient &s;y&s;tem of defence which may be compa|tible with the intere&s;ts of a free people &amp;c.</P>
<P>The modern practice in Europe with re&s;pect to the employment of &s;tand|ing armies, has created &s;uch a ma&s;s of opinion in their favour, that even
<PB N="53" REF="037249_0053_100C9D62E8359FF8">
philo&s;ophers and the advocates of liberty have frequently confe&s;&s;ed their u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity in certain ca&s;es.</P>
<P>But whoever &s;eriou&s;ly and candidly e&s;timates the power of di&s;cipline and the tendency of military habits, will be con&s;trained to confe&s;s, that whate|ver may be the efficacy of a &s;tanding army in war, it cannot in peace be con&s;idered as friendly to the rights of human nature, &amp;c. But any argu|ment on this head may be con&s;idered as unnece&s;&s;ary to the enlightened Citi|zens of the United States.</P>
<P>A &s;mall corps of well di&s;ciplined and well informed Artileri&s;ts and En|gineers, and a legion for the protection of the frontiers and the magazines and ar&s;enals, are <HI>all</HI> the <HI>military e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> which may be required for the pre&s;ent u&s;e of the United States.&mdash;The <HI>privates</HI> of the Corps to be en|li&s;ted for a certain period, and after the expiration of which to return to the ma&s;s of the people.</P>
<P>Page 7. An <HI>energetic national militia</HI> is to be regarded as the <HI>capital &s;ecu|rity</HI> of a free republic; and not a <HI>&s;tanding</HI> army, forming a di&s;tinct cla&s;s in the community.</P>
<P>It is the introduction and diffu&s;ion of vice and corruption of manners in|to the ma&s;s of the people, that renders a &s;tanding army nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;It is when public &s;pirit is de&s;pi&s;ed, and avarice, indolence and effeminacy of manners predominate, and prevent the e&s;tabli&s;hment of in&s;titutions which would elevate the minds of the youth in the paths of virtue and honour, that a &s;tanding army is formed and rivetted for ever, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be decided to reject a &s;tanding army for the military branch of the government, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing too fierce an a&s;pect, and being ho&s;tile to the principles of liberty, it will follow that a well-con&s;tituted militia ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, &amp;o.</P>
<P>Such were the &s;entiments of General Wa&s;hington's Secretary at war.&mdash; Let us now turn to the opinions of Mr. Adam's Secretary at war.</P>
<P>I have already noticed the report of the Secretary at war, of December 24th. 1798, and the force therein mentioned, of 50,000 men.</P>
<P>In his report tran&s;mitted by the Pre&s;ident to Congre&s;s 13th. January 1800, there is an elaborate plan for a military Academy: he &s;tates the expence of the two regiments of artilleri&s;ts and engineers, as they now &s;tand <HI>on the e&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI> (page 23)&mdash;He &s;ubmits the preceding plan as e&s;&s;ential to the improvement of our military e&s;tabli&s;hment. (page 24)&mdash;He con&s;iders the volunteer a&s;&s;ociations as a re&s;erve body to reinforce our <HI>regular army</HI> &mdash; He recommends enli&s;tments for 5 years in future, if it &s;hould be deemed ex|pedient to <HI>keep up</HI> a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment more extended than before (page 27)&mdash;He &s;tates in page 35 the po&s;itions of the exi&s;ting regular force, and &s;peaks of the four regiments of Infantry and the two companies of Cavalry on the <HI>permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>His letter (13th. February 1800) to the chairman of the Committee of Congre&s;s on &s;o much of the &s;peech of the Pre&s;ident as relate to a <HI>a &s;y&s;tem of national defence,</HI> is a laboured expo&s;ition of the inutility and inefficacy of a militia, and the ab&s;urdity of relying on this means of defence.&mdash;In the very out&s;et he declares
<Q>That it is not conceived the United States will ever be di&s;po&s;ed to place their reliance for defence again&s;t a foreign invading ene|my on militia alone, but that they will <HI>at all times maintain a body of re|gular troops</HI> commen&s;urate with their ability to maintain them.</Q>
Page 5 and 6 of that letter are occupied in arguments again&s;t the malitia &s;y&s;tem&punc;
<PB N="54" REF="037249_0054_100C9D65F2AA5A28">
the whole letter is a recommendation of a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment of regu|lar troops.&mdash;The reports are recommended to the &s;erious con&s;iderations of Congre&s;s by Pre&s;ident Adams; and the letter to the Chairman, is a com|ment on that part of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech which gave ri&s;e to the Committee.</P>
<P>From the&s;e extracts the public mu&s;t draw their own conclu&s;ions.&mdash;Had I produced <HI>all</HI> the evidence in my power on the various charges in the indict|ment, the day would hardly have &s;ufficed for the defence; and the patience and attention of the Court the Jury, the auditors and my&s;elf, would have been exhau&s;ted long before the clo&s;e.</P>

<P><Q>The French revolution has ever been incomprehen&s;ible to me. The &s;ub&s;tance of all I can under&s;tand of it is, that one of the pillars of the ancient monarchy, that is the army, has fallen upon the other two, the nobility and clergy, and broken them both down; the building has fallen of cour&s;e, and this pillar is now the whole edifice. The military &s;upport has &s;wallowed that of Adam and all the re&s;t. If the example &s;hould be followed through Europe, when the officers of the armies begin to quarrel with one another, five hundred years more of Baron's wars may &s;ucceed. If the French therefore will become the enemies of all mankind by forcing all nations to follow their example, in the &s;ubver|&s;ion of all the political, religious and &s;ocial in&s;titutions, which time, ex|perience and freedom, have &s;anctioned, they ought to be oppo&s;ed by every country that has any preten&s;ions to principle, &s;pirit and pa|trioti&s;m.</Q></P>

The other was printed by infamous &s;coundrel, a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, a paper which he was &s;orry to find much countenanced. This paper not only breathes war, but exterminating war. And this paper i&s;&s;uing from a Briti&s;h pre&s;s, &s;preads its baneful influence through the country- He proclaimed this fact, and he &s;hould think him&s;elf a traitor to his country if he did not proclaim it.</Q>

<P><HI>In the True American of April <HI>14 1800,</HI> Mr.Gallatin, who&s;e caution as well as acutene&s;s is &s;ufficiently well known to the public, is &s;tated to have ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this purpo&s;e:</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Danbury certificates &s;o much relied on amounted only to negative proof which was no proof whatever; and in oppo&s;ition, if not to the&s;e certificates, at lea&s;t to the inferences drawn from them, he would &s;ay that he had informa|tion, from authority &s;ufficient to have convinced him and &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify his repeating it on this floor, that there had been a family, by the name of Robbins, living either in the town of Danbury or in its immediate neighbour|hood, altho' they had removed many years ago to another &s;tate; that the man calling him&s;elf Jonathan Robbins, if he did really belong to that family, &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed the place of his birth to be Danbury, although it might be the next town to it, that he &s;hould have made the mi&s;take in his relation to a
<PB N="57" REF="037249_0057_100C9D6C69E66508">
"place which he had left in his infancy, could by no means invalidate his te&s;ti|mony. On the other hand, if the man who had been delivered up did not be|long to that family, if he was not Robbins, but Na&s;h the Iri&s;hman, how bad it happened that he &s;hould &s;o &s;trangely have gue&s;&s;ed at the place where the family who&s;e name he had a&s;&s;umed had re&s;ided perhaps more than twenty years before? He, the &s;uppo&s;ed Na&s;h, in the fir&s;t place obtains a notarial protection dated at New-York in <HI>1795,</HI> by the name of and &s;igned Jonathan Robbins, &s;tating him to be a native of Connecticut, but without &s;pecifying the town. In <HI>1799</HI> in open court before Judge Bee, his, the &s;uppo&s;ed Na&s;h's hand writing appears &s;imilar to the &s;ignature of Robbins affixed to the notarial protection; he at the &s;ame time, by his affidavit, de&s;ignates the town of Connecticut, where he pretends to have been born; and although that town was not de&s;ignated in the protection he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have obtained fraudulently, yet he divines either the identical town where a Robbins family had formerly re&s;ided, or one adjoining to it."</HI></P>
<P><HI>This led me to make further enquiry, and I had rea&s;on to believe that Mr. J. Davenport was capable of giving information re&s;pecting the uncertain limits of the town of Danbury at the time when Robbins might be pre&s;umed to have lived there, and even that &s;uch a family did formerly live in the town or the neighbourhood. I find on &s;ub&s;equent enquiry that Col. Lyon has not con|ver&s;ed directly with the brother of Jonathan Robbins, but that his neighbour Dr. Shaw has conver&s;ed with a man of the name of Robbins, who declared him&s;elf to have lived formerly near Danbury, who had a brother named Jona|than, whom he under&s;tood went to &s;ea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is a very &s;ingular fact, that an illiterate Iri&s;hman &s;hould be &s;o well able to conceal the tone and dialect of his country, as to pa&s;s for a moment for a Connecticut man? And yet while the cau&s;e was pending before Judge Bee, the prima facie evidence was, that he was an American. The brogue has never yet been urged in proof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I take this opportunity of mentioning that the other members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives were called, in expectation that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for me, (as Mr. Gales the &s;hort-hand writer is in North Carolina) to authenticate cer|tain declarations and expre&s;&s;ions in the Congre&s;&s;ional Regi&s;ter which I had mark'd for u&s;e, and to give information on &s;ome other points which I fully intended to have brought forward.

differences of opinion &s;o repeated and &s;o recent&mdash;after conduct &s;o wavering and indeci&s;ive, I may &s;afely venture to a&s;&s;ert that your in&s;inuations re&s;pect|ing my legal capacity may be controverted without pre&s;umption. While I am in court, I know it is my duty, and I feel it my inclination to &s;ubmit with deference to the <HI>ex Cathedra</HI> deci&s;ions you are authorized to pro|nounce; but that deference to the con&s;titutional expounders of the laws, does not deprive me of the right to call up in &s;elf defence their erroneous opinions before the more &s;olemn tribunal of the Public.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to the points of difference between us.</P>
<P N="1">I. I claimed a right to the attendance of the Pre&s;ident under proce&s;s of the court.</P>
<P>When an opinion is once &s;ettled by the deliberate deci&s;ion of a court, I think the Judges are right not to permit coun&s;el to travel over beaten ground, or to re-urge the arguments and objections that have been already maturely con&s;idered and &s;ettled: it was for this rea&s;on I declined making any objection to the con&s;titutionality of the &s;edition law, though I had no doubt of the validity of that objection. But I appeal to common &s;en&s;e and to profe&s;&s;ional experience, whether it is either proper or u&s;ual for a court to decide a <HI>new</HI> and a doubtful point, without hearing argument, when re|que&s;ted by a party concerned? Whether the deci&s;ion of the court was right or not, your refu&s;al to hear me on the &s;ubject, cannot be defended. Patience is required in a judge at all times, particularly on the deci&s;ion of new ca&s;es, particularly toward a defendant on an indictment, and particu|larly when he pleads for him&s;elf. All the&s;e con&s;iderations &s;hould have in|duced you to have li&s;tened to the following ob&s;ervations that then occurred to me.</P>
<P>Your objection was, that being an indictment for a fal&s;e and malicious libel again&s;t the Pre&s;ident, he could not be called upon to give te&s;timony at all: for it was improper to &s;ubject him to que&s;tions that might make him accu&s;e him&s;elf of mal-admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>I reply fir&s;t, that the Pre&s;ident is not the pro&s;ecutor here. That there is no ground for con&s;idering him as a legal party to this indictment, and it might be brought without his con&s;ent. It is not the United States on the pro&s;ecution of the Pre&s;ident again&s;t Thomas Cooper, but the United States on the pro&s;ecution of the Attorney General <HI>ex officio,</HI> again&s;t Thomas Coo|per. Not being a party therefore, he might be examined.</P>
<P>I &s;ay &s;econdly, that it is &s;till further evident that he is not legally a par|ty, for I could not demand, on &s;uch an indictment, to have a pro&s;ecutor indor&s;ed.</P>
<P>I &s;ay thirdly, that <HI>ex-officio</HI> informations may lie, where the Attorney Ge|neral has a right to call upon the per&s;on injured to &s;upport the pro&s;ecution by giving te&s;timony on behalf of the United States: and farther that pro&s;ecu|tors or indictments are liable to be cro&s;s-examined by a defendant, whene|ver they are called as evidences, (as they very commonly are) in &s;upport of their own pro&s;ecution. So that the objections of your honour would avail in a con&s;iderable degree again&s;t common and known practice: but as I doubt whether they could be cro&s;s-examined out of the examination in chief, I do not re&s;t on this argument.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the que&s;tions put, need not have been &s;uch as would in|duce any legal crimination by the an&s;wers. For in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e I had a&s;k|ed
<PB N="60" REF="037249_0060_100C847492D3B7A8">
the Pre&s;ident, did you direct the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution? did Mr. Stoddart con&s;ult you on his report re&s;pecting the Navy? Was you privy to and did you approve of Colonel Mc'Henry's reports on the army? Did Mr. Li&s;|ton or any per&s;on on the part of Great Britain, apply to you under the Trea|ty for the delivery of the Hermione &s;ailors, tried before Judge Cha&s;e in the Jer&s;eys? was there any communication between you and Judge Bee, pre|vious to Mr. Li&s;tons letter? Were you appri&s;ed of the ca&s;e of the United States vs. Judge Lawrence? Surely the an&s;wers to tho&s;e and many other que&s;tions relevant to the i&s;&s;ue that might be framed, need not have inclu|ded any legal crimination. For that is the point: a man is not relieved from a que&s;tion becau&s;e it may tend to &s;hew that he has been mi&s;taken or faulty; if the an&s;wer does not &s;ubject him to legal reproof, the que&s;tion may be put.</P>
<P>Fifthly, I think I had a clear right to his evidence on a preliminary and collateral que&s;tion; for in&s;tance, as we have no Gazette as yet printed by <HI>Royal</HI> authority in this country, I wanted to &s;hew that the Pre&s;ident had countenanced and given authenticity to Fenno's Gazette. I wanted to bring my evidence completely within Rex v Holt. The Pre&s;ident I believe could have enabled me to do this, and &s;urely &s;uch que&s;tions as this point would have required, could not be objected to as within the rea&s;on of your deci|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Nor did your own ideas on the light in which the Pre&s;ident was to be con&s;idered &s;eem quite clear: This rejecttion of his te&s;timony evi|dently goes on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he would have appeared too much in the character of a pro&s;ecutor, and yet you decided that I was mi&s;taken in con&s;idering him in that light. But your honour mi&s;took me: I knew that he was not the legal, but I had a right to look upon him as the actual pro|&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>I know that men of eminence at the bar think you were wrong in deci|ding the point again&s;t me; but it may admit of doubt, for the ca&s;e is new, and no analogous ca&s;e <HI>can</HI> occur under Fox's Libel Bill.</P>
<P>But can it admit of doubt whether you ought to have heard arguments on &s;o new a point?</P>
<P N="2">II. You denied that I had any right to copies of official documents.&mdash; You &s;aid you knew of no <HI>law</HI> that would entitle me to them.</P>
<P>Be good enough Judge Cha&s;e to read the following extracts from the act of Congre&s;s entitled

<Q>On the opening of this cau&s;e it was &s;ugge&s;ted by the coun&s;el for Mr. Le Me&s;urier, that frequent applications had been made by him to Go|vernment for a copy of the order of coun&s;el.&mdash;Now if &s;uch an order had exi&s;ted and had been produced it would have prevented this flood of li|tigation. Mr. Le Me&s;urier would not have heard &s;o many brilliant ar|guments either for or again&s;t him&s;elf, nor the court have had the fatigue of watching them with extraordinary attention.&mdash;In any cau&s;e, where the crown is a party, it is to be ob&s;erved, <HI>that the Crown</HI> can no more <HI>withhold</HI> evidence of documents in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>than a private</HI> per&s;on.&mdash; If the court thinks proper to order the production of any public in&s;tru|ment, that order mu&s;t be obeyed.&mdash;It wants no In&s;ignia of authority de|rived from the Crown.&mdash;The order will enforce it&s;elf.&mdash;For if a party <HI>&s;uing refu&s;es to produce a nece&s;&s;ary document,</HI> what follows? He &s;hall take nothing by his petition.</Q></P>
<P>All this was before me on the table; the reference marked.&mdash;Why did I not quote it? Becau&s;e I &s;hould have been again liable to the charge of impropriety and indecency and perhaps with additional reproach, for a|gain venturing to doubt your honours deci&s;ion&mdash;We are now before the public&mdash;let them judge whether you or I more de&s;erve the profe&s;&s;ional &s;ar|ca&s;ms you thought fit to aim at me.</P>
<P N="3">III. The documents I read &s;eemed permitted on the part of your ho|nours rather as a matter of indulgence than of right. I was without coun|&s;el, and you were graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to permit <HI>me</HI> to &s;ay and to quote many things that a profe&s;&s;ional advocate would have been re&s;trained from. The chief evidence I wanted was Fenno's paper; in which all my quotations were marked; though I u&s;ed the &s;election of addre&s;&s;es for temporary con|venience.</P>
<P>Now I &s;ay, I was <HI>not</HI> obliged to your honours for the permi&s;&s;ion to read Fenno's paper&mdash;For 1&s;t, I contend &s;till that on a <HI>political</HI> trial that evidence to which the public con&s;tantly re&s;orts is <HI>prima facie</HI> evidence to go to a jury. 2dly, Fenno's Gazette approaches &s;o near to the ca&s;e of a Royal Gazette that it is hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable. It is a paper approbatory of the mea&s;ures of government. Fenno is printer to the &s;enate; and had I not been re&s;trained from examining the Pre&s;ident, I think I could have proved that Fenno was his printer too. But 4thly, <HI>it was the be&s;t evidence the na|ture of the circum&s;tances would admit,</HI> for the higher grades of evidence were refu&s;ed me by your honours' deci&s;ion, and by the illiberal conduct of Mr. Adams. If I was interdicted from procuring better, this became the be&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">IV. You denied the Pre&s;ident's me&s;&s;age to be evidence, becau&s;e I had it not by me at the time I wrote.&mdash;I think this objection is founded on a mi&s;|take of the i&s;&s;ue, which was, <HI>true or not true</HI> generally; without reference
<PB N="62" REF="037249_0062_100C9D77B17B1188">
to time. But having dwelt on this before I &s;hall not repeat my argu|ments here.</P>
<P N="5">V. My allegation that the <HI>notoriety</HI> of political fact, was a proper cir|cum&s;tance to be judged of by the jury, &s;eemed evidently by your manner, to be permitted out of indulgence and compa&s;&s;ion, while on my part I &s;ub|mitted to what pa&s;&s;ed, out of deference to the high character with which you were cloathed; but a man mu&s;t be very ill read in the trials for &s;edi|tion, and mu&s;t very carele&s;sly have attended to Mr. Rawle's &s;peech and your charge, not to be convinced that notoriety of political fact mu&s;t &s;ometimes be taken for granted: how far it ought to avail, is circum&s;tanse to the jury. If on trial where character can be given in evidence&mdash;if on trials as in England on pre&s;criptive road-cau&s;es&mdash;if on trials re&s;pecting marriage, common reputation may be &s;tated as evidence, how much more proper is it on the general facts of public politics. The hard&s;hip and ab|&s;urdity of in&s;i&s;ting on &s;trict legal evidence in &s;uch a ca&s;e, is in my opinion too glaring to be enlarged upon.</P>
<P N="6">VI. You object to charging the navy on the Pre&s;ident, and yet you mu&s;t have known, that the mea&s;ure was grounded on the Pre&s;ident's &s;peeches and on Mr. Stoddard's report. <HI>Qui facit per alium facit per &s;e.</HI> That it is a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment appears from the purcha&s;e of woods and i&s;lands for the u&s;e of the navy. See the reports and acts of Congre&s;s relative to the navy. But if it met with no more than his &s;anction, my po&s;ition was true, independent of the proof I adduced.</P>
<P N="7">VII. I mu&s;t join i&s;&s;ue with you on the &s;ubject of the army, though I much di&s;like the har&s;h terms wherein you have expre&s;&s;ed the alternative. I think you are wrong; for, 1&s;t, a &s;tanding army, as I have before &s;tated, is a body of troops exi&s;ting in permanent di&s;cipline in contradi&s;tinction to the periodical di&s;cipline of militia forces. The term is Engli&s;h, u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e by every author who has written on the &s;ubject in that country, and particularly in the legi&s;lative debates and the lords' prote&s;ts.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The appropriations for the &s;tanding army in that country as well as the mutiny bill, are annual, as appears by the annual "Di&s;tribution of Grants," pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of commons of Great-Britain.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The &s;oldiery <HI>there</HI> are enli&s;ted for life, although the appropriati|ons are annual. <HI>Here</HI> they are enli&s;ted on the PERMANENT ESTABLISH|MENT (M'Henry's Rep. 13th Jan. 1800, p. 35) for five years. No man is enli&s;ted for 1, 2, 3 or 4 years&mdash;hence there is a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and &s;upply kept up. So are the in&s;tructions of enli&s;tment.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, The Terms made u&s;e of for that army in the reports of colonel M'Henry, and in the act of congre&s;s entitled, "An an act to a&s;certain and fix the Military e&s;tabli&s;hment of the United States," are e&s;tabli&s;hment, per|manent e&s;tabli&s;hment, to keep up by enli&s;tments, &amp;c. You ought to have known this. The five-year army is not a five-year army, but a permanent army, where every &s;oldier enli&s;ted, is enli&s;ted for the term of five years from the date of his enli&s;tment.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. I cannot account for your mode of arguing the ca&s;e of JONA|THAN ROBBINS, but whoever attended the trial will be able to account why I did not examine you on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hermione &s;eamen indicted for piracy before you in Jer&s;ey. How happens it in the fir&s;t place that you &s;o &s;trangely omitted to notice the prominent charge of <HI>Piracy?</HI> A charge that came before your&s;elf in the ca&s;e of the other &s;eamen of the Hermione&punc;
<PB N="63" REF="037249_0063_100C9D79E0E8E570">
a charge that came before Judge Bee in Robbins's ca&s;e, that was &s;pecifically recognized by the Pre&s;ident and by Mr. Pickering in the me&s;&s;age noticed by my&s;elf, and which you mu&s;t know gave indi&s;putable juri&s;diction to the circuit court. Surely you ought to have known, and ought not to have omitted this &s;trong point.</P>
<P>A pirate is de&s;cribed as <HI>He&s;tis humani Generis.</HI> Moll. l. 1. c. 4. &sect; 1.&mdash; He is not an offender again&s;t a particular country, but again&s;t all countries, and therefore all countries have juri&s;diction. This doctrine is recognized in the following ca&s;es of Engli&s;h law:
<Q>The king of England hath not only an empire and &s;overeignty over the Briti&s;h &s;eas for the puni&s;hment of piracy; but in concurrence with other Princes and States, an un|doubted juri&s;diction and power in the mo&s;t remote parts of the world. If any per&s;on therefore, native or foreigner, Chri&s;tian or infidel, Turk or pagan, with who&s;e country we are in amity, trade or corre&s;pondence, &s;hall be robbed or &s;poiled in the narrow or other &s;eas, whether the Medi|terranean, Atlantic, Southern or any blanches thereof either in this or the other &s;ide of the line, it is piracy within the limits and cognizance of the admiralty &s;e&s;&s;ions. Sir Ch. Hodge's charge. <BIBL>Old Bailey 8. w. 3. Hawk. pl. c. 152, of Dublin ed. 1788.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>"The Captain of a French merchantman, having put into a port in Ire|land, was accu&s;ed by his crew of robberies on the &s;eas, and fled. His &s;hip and goods were con&s;idered as having belonged to pirates. The French con&s;uls pre&s;ented memorials requiring the cau&s;e to be remanded to the na|tural judge, as was pretended, in France. But the king and his coun&s;el finally adjudged that he was &s;ufficiently founded in point of juri&s;diction, to confi&s;cate the &s;hip and goods, and to try capitally the captain him&s;elf, had he been in hold; the matter of Renvoy being a thing quite di&s;u&s;ed among princes; and as every man by the u&s;age of our European nations is <HI>ju&s;ticiable</HI> in the place where the crime is committed, &s;o are pirates, being out of the protection of all laws and privileges, and to be tried in what part &s;oever they are taken. 2. Woodde&s;on, &sect; 428. Sr. Leol. Jenk. Rep. 714.</P>
<P>The juri&s;diction having thus attached to the Circuit court, and having been acted upon, ought not to have been &s;urrendered at the advice or re|que&s;t of any man whatever.</P>
<P>Had the crime been murder alone, as your charge implies, I incline to think your doctrine would have been well founded. But you know, or ought to know, that where an inferior crime flows from a &s;uperior, the former is merged in the latter. Thus, Tre&s;pa&s;s is merged in Felony, A&s;|&s;ault and Battery, in Riot. In the fir&s;t &s;ection of Molloy's chapter on pi|racy, he de&s;cribes a pirate as a &s;ea thief: ho&s;tis humani generis, who, to enrich him&s;elf, either by &s;urpri&s;e or open force, &s;ets upon merchants and others trading by &s;ea, ever &s;poiling their lading, if they can by any means get the ma&s;tery, <HI>&s;ometimes bereaving them of their lives,</HI> and &s;inking their &s;hips **** again&s;t the&s;e, any prince hath power to make war, though they be not &s;ubject to his government. Molloy L. 1. c. 4. &sect; 1. Grot. de Jur. Belli. L. 2. c. 20. &sect; 40.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that the court had juri&s;diction: that the court acted upon it: that the court in&s;tead of deciding upon argument, adopted the opinion of the executive on two judicial que&s;tions: that the court li&s;tened
<PB N="64" REF="037249_0064_100C9D7DA3F0BEA0">
to and acted upon the advice and reque&s;t of the executive in a ca&s;e within judicial authority.</P>
<P>Again. Why was it that you did not notice the very &s;trong ca&s;e of the United States and Judge Lawrence? If it did not apply, why not &s;ayh &s;o? If it did, why not allow its proper force? Why give room to &s;uppo&s;e it was too &s;trong to be controverted?</P>
<P N="9">IX. I complain of improper conduct in your &s;umming up again&s;t me: <HI>I</HI> &s;ay (&s;ubmitting to public opinion) that it is not a part of a judge's duty to argue a cau&s;e again&s;t a defendant on a penal pro&s;ecution&mdash;to notice the omi&s;&s;ion of an Attorney General&mdash;to dwell upon circum&s;tances of aggrava|tion&mdash;to omit &s;trong points of the defence, or to let the jury perceive a bias in the mind of the court. I &s;ay this is notoriou&s;ly again&s;t the practice of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bench at lea&s;t. It might have been plea&s;ing to Mr. Pickering on your right hand, to Me&s;&s;rs. Read, Harper, &amp;c. on your left, to Mr. Tracy behind you, to Me&s;&s;rs. Shaw, Stoddart and Mc'Henry in front of you, but I <HI>think,</HI> the public will not regard it with the &s;ame encomia&s;tic placidity.</P>
<P N="10">X. And that I may not omit any of the points of difference between us, I &s;hall &s;tate that, tho' your objection to the <HI>generality</HI> of my affidavit, was perhaps in &s;trictne&s;s of law defen&s;ible, yet it was not conformable to the practice I have witne&s;&s;ed in the courts here: where a party is not entitled according to the rules off practice, to put off a cau&s;e, and where an inconve|nience will ari&s;e to his opponent from deferring it, or where there is ground to &s;u&s;pect intentional delay, there the courts always require a &s;pe|cial affidavit, going to the points that the ab&s;ent witne&s;&s;es are required to prove; but where no affectation of delay is imputable, and where a party has not claimed the cau&s;e to be deferred before, a general affidavit is not u&s;ually objected to.</P>
<P>I had a right from the common indulgence, to have put off my trial till next term, and therefore was compleatly within the equity of what I un|der&s;tood to be, the rule of practice here: but I &s;hall not deny your right to in&s;i&s;t as you did, though it was certainty &s;tretching the law to the utmo&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the ca&s;e of the King v. Tandy and Morris, Feb. 12, 1799, in the King's Bench of Ireland, "the defendants were again brought up," and their coun&s;el moved to po&s;tpone the trial till next term, &s;tating the ab&s;ence of &s;everal material witne&s;&s;es at Hamburgh. Though in this ca&s;e it &s;hould appear that the pri&s;oners were brought up at the &s;econd term, which I was not, though the affidavit did not &s;tate that the witne&s;&s;es had been &s;ought for or &s;erved with proce&s;s, which mine did; although there was rea&s;onable doubt whether they could be procured at all&mdash;a doubt which did not exi&s;t in my ca&s;e; though the offence there, was much higher than the charge again&s;t me, yet the attorney general objecting to the legal &s;ufficiency of the affidavit, allowed the trial to be put off on that ground. This ca&s;e is reported by Brown, Phil. Gaz. April 21, 1800.</NOTE></P>
<P>Your charge of indecency for pre&s;uming to offer arguments again&s;t the deci&s;ion of the court, prevented me from u&s;ing at that time the authorities in my power. But you have now an opportunity if you plea&s;e, of de&s;cend|ing into the arena of the public, a mark of attention on my part that you owe to the &s;ituation you fill. You have thrown out the challenge of pro|fe&s;&s;ional imputation and it is accepted.</P>
