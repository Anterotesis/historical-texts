<P>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers: let him not leave us, nor for&s;ake us: That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his Com|mandments, and his Statutes, and his Judg|ments, which he Commanded our Fathers.</P></Q>

<P>THESE Words now read in your Chri&s;tian Audience, [<HI>Much Ho|noured, Reverend, and Beloved,</HI>] are a part of that Royal Ble&s;&s;ing wherewith King <HI>Solomon</HI> ble&s;&s;ed the Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> after an Elaborate
<PB N="2" REF="001279_0004_0FB204269D0C4780">
and Affectionate Prayer for them, at the Solemn Dedication of the Temple, which he had build and fini&s;hed for Gods Honour and Wor&s;hip: Supplicating the Divine Pre&s;ence and Favour as the Fountain of all ble&s;&s;ings, with the Sig|nal Manife&s;tation thereof in &s;ome &s;pecial Acts of Grace and Mercy: that the God of their Fa|thers would own them, and be with them &s;till; not leave or for&s;ake them: and that He would manife&s;t this, not only by giving them outward Pro&s;perity, but ble&s;&s;ing them with Spiritual Ble&s;|&s;ings. Particularly, that as he had given them his Word and Statutes to teach and direct them in the way that they &s;hould walk; &s;o he would by his Holy Spirit Effectually incline and en|gage their hearts to Keep and Obey them.</P>
<P>It is ju&s;tly to be e&s;teemed the Highe&s;t Honour and Happine&s;s of a People, to have the <HI>Lord JEHOVAH</HI> for their God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 144.15. <HI>David</HI> pronounces the <HI>People happy that were in &s;uch a ca&s;e,</HI> as is before de&s;cribed, when their Sons [which be the Strength, Safety and Hopes of a Nation] are as Flouri&s;hing <HI>Plants grown up in their Youth:</HI> Their Daughters [on whom the Hope of Po&s;te|rity depends] <HI>as Corner-Stones poli&s;ht after the &s;i|militude of a Palace;</HI> Strong and Beautiful, A|dorned with all the Ornaments proper to their Sex: <HI>When their Garners are full, affording all man|ner of Stones, their Sheep bringing forth Thou&s;ands and ten Thou&s;ands, their Oxen &s;trong to Labour, no break|ing

in of the Enemy,</HI> nor going out again&s;t them, nor with them into Captivity, no Complaining in their Streets, no Out-Cry or Howling for a|ny &s;ad Tidings, Publick grievances or Calamities. Happy is the People enjoying &s;uch Plenty and Peace, &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t: Yet immediately there|upon, not in way of Compari&s;on herewith, but Correction of him&s;elf, He cryes out, <HI>Yea Happy is the People who&s;e God is the LORD.</HI> The former was a very De&s;irable E&s;tate in it &s;elf, but com|paratively it is nothing. The true and chief Happine&s;s of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> does not con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e things, which are common to others with us, but in this Peculiar Priviledge, That the true &amp; Ble&s;&s;ed God is our God by Covenant, and &s;pe|cial Relation.</P>
<P><HI>Nextly,</HI> In having his Laws, Statutes and Judg|ments for the Rule of our Life and Walk, with an Heart inclined to <HI>Ob&s;erve</HI> and <HI>Keep</HI> them. This al&s;o was <HI>I&s;raels</HI> peculiar Priviledge at fir&s;t, To have the Revelation of Gods Mind and Will in his Word, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 147.19, 20. With which Argu|ments <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the Servant of the Lord, by whom the Law was fir&s;t given, urges the People to O|bedience, <HI>Deut.</HI> 4.6, 7, 8. Hereupon the People generally Promi&s;e Obedience; <HI>All that the Lord our God &s;hall &s;peak unto us by thee, We will hear &amp; do it.</HI> Which Prote&s;tation of theirs God him&s;elf takes notice of and accepts as to the Matter of it: commanding them for it &s;o far, Saying to <HI>Mo&s;es,
<PB N="4" REF="001279_0006_0FB2042D0F9303C8">
I have heard the Voice of the Words of this People, which they have &s;poken unto thee, and they have well &s;aid all that they have &s;poken.</HI> But then, (after the manner of men) expre&s;&s;es an holy jealou&s;y or &s;u&s;picion of the Truth and Sincerity of their Profe&s;&s;ion, <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.28, 29. <HI>Oh that there were &s;uch an Heart in them, thus to Fear me always, and Keep all my Commandments,</HI> &amp;c. It was que&s;tionable as to Man, tho' not as to God, whether there were &s;uch a Principle of Obedience in them as was like to be la&s;ting, or without which they would &s;urely fail as to the performance.</P>
<P>The Thing it &s;elf was greatly to be wi&s;hed by them, and for them, from the great Advantages that would accrue unto them and their Po&s;teri|ty therefrom: But who &s;hall give them &s;uch an Heart? (as the Hebrew Words may be rendred) Who but God him&s;elf can confer this Grace and Ble&s;&s;ing on any People? If the&s;e Words were &s;poken by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> (as &s;ome think) they are his Option or Prayer to God for I&s;rael: that as he had newly delivered to them the great things of his Law, and they had engaged to Ob&s;erve and Do all, their Hearts might be rightly framed to &s;uch an Obedience, as was required of them, and now promi&s;ed by them. Who will give them &s;uch an Heart, or who will give their Heart to be &s;uch in them? Tis certain that God alone can do this; therefore it implies an Addre&s;s to Him for it. Now from the &s;ame &s;ence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Spirit
<PB N="5" REF="001279_0007_0FB2042E2C31D7C0">
it is, that <HI>Solomon</HI> makes this Reque&s;t, or Pro|nounces this Ble&s;&s;ing in our Text. <HI>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers, let him not leave us, nor forsake us: That He may incline our Hearts unto Him, to keep his Commandments,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINAL Conclu&s;ion hence is this.</P>
<P><HI>That the mo&s;t De&s;irable Ble&s;&s;ing which can be asked or wi&s;hed for, and pronounced upon any People under Heaven [as a Fruit and Evidence of the Divine Pre&s;ence with, and Favour towards them] is, That the God of Heaven would incline their Hearts to Him&s;elf, to Walk in all his Ways, to Keep his Commandments, his Statutes and his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>Or more briefly thus,</P>
<P><HI>That the Choice&s;t Mercy which any People have to de&s;ire for Them&s;elves and Po&s;terity, or that God has to be&s;tow upon them in this Life, is to make them a Religious, and an Obedient People.</HI></P>
<P>This is the &s;umm of <HI>Solomons</HI> comprehen&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing here, and it is indeed the comprehen&s;e of all Ble&s;&s;ings. Thus ble&s;t was <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the pi|ous Reign of his immediate Predece&s;&s;or: The Heart of his Royal Father was fully inclined to the Lord, and to his Te&s;timonies, <HI>Act.</HI> 13.22. concerning whom the Lord him&s;elf thus re&s;tify|ed
<PB N="6" REF="001279_0008_0FB2141214040DD0">
and &s;aid; <HI>I have found</HI> David <HI>the Son of</HI> Je&s;&s;e, <HI>a man after mine own heart, who &s;hall fulfil all my will,</HI> [that is in Governing his People.] This was the chief Qualification which God re&s;pect|ed in his Choice of him to be King over <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.7. Looking, not as man, to the out|ward Appearance, but judging by the Heart; Calling him from a mean Employment, to the highe&s;t Seat in the Government; <HI>from following the Ewes great with young, he brought him to feed</HI> Jacob <HI>his People, and</HI> I&s;rael <HI>his Inheritance: So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulne&s;s of his Hands.</HI> This is the Te&s;timonial which God has left upon Re|cord for him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78.72. Wherein are commen|ded two nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications of a good Prince or Chief Ruler in <HI>David. Integrity,</HI> whereby he &s;incerely &s;ought the Good and Wel|fare of his People, avoiding and abhorring tho&s;e; Coun&s;els and Cour&s;es which were contrary thereunto. <HI>Skilfulne&s;s,</HI> whereby he managed all Affairs of the Publick with &s;ingular Prudence: which is here a&s;cribed to his Hands, not as if &s;ea|ted in them, but becau&s;e acted and di&s;covered by them, as appeared in all his Actions and Ad|mini&s;trations. It is &s;ad with a People when their Chief Ruler wants either of the&s;e, <HI>Skilful|ne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Faithfulne&s;s;</HI> and 'tis hard to &s;ay which of the&s;e can be wor&s;t &s;pared. King <HI>David</HI> was eminently accompli&s;hed with both, and the
<PB N="7" REF="001279_0009_0FB214165FE75FA8">
People extraordinarily Happy under a Per&s;on of &s;uch a Spirit and Accompli&s;hment. The Holy Spirit of God improving his Prudent Coun&s;el, and Pious Example to be influential, as a means to make them in love with the ways of Holi|ne&s;s, Obedience, and In&s;tituted Religion.</P>
<P>Now this Devout Prince being about to De|mi&s;e his Crown and Government, gave with it this &s;olemn Charge to <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son, that he &s;hould <HI>Know and Serve the God of his Father, with a perfect heart and a willing mind,</HI> 1 Chron. 28.9 Keep clo&s;e to his Laws &amp; Ordinances, a&s;&s;uring him of Gods Pre&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing, in ca&s;e he did &s;o: Otherwi&s;e, if he for&s;ook God, that he might expect to be for&s;aken of him: to all which, <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays <HI>Amen;</HI> imploring the Di|vine Help for him&s;elf and People, &s;ues for a double Portion of <HI>Davids</HI> Spirit, Wi&s;dom and Piety, with an Entailment of all Happine&s;s to Po&s;terity in the Cau&s;es of it: <HI>The Lord God of our Fathers be with us as he was with them, let him not leave us, nor for&s;ake us, but incline our Hearts to Him&s;elf and Ways, that &s;o it may go well with us, and with our Children for ever.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to a more di&s;tinct Con&s;ideration of what is contained in the Doctrine, I &s;hall lay down the&s;e three Propo&s;itions.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="8" REF="001279_0010_0FB214181514C250">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That Gods Pre&s;ence and Favour, or His Favourable Pre&s;ence? is the &s;upream Cau&s;e, Original, Author, Spring and Fountain of all Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> (to a Per&s;on or People) <HI>Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal.</HI></P>
<P>There is a threefold Pre&s;ence of God menti|oned in the Scripture. As,</P>
<P N="1">I. God is Naturally and <HI>E&s;&s;entially Pre&s;ent</HI> with all his Creatures. He is an Immen&s;e Be|ing, and no Creature po&s;&s;ibly could Act, Sub&s;i&s;t or Be without him. Thus <HI>Paul</HI> argued in the Court of <HI>Athens,</HI> Act. 17.27, 28. <HI>God is not far from every one of us, for in him we live, move and have our being.</HI> He is near us all, he is with us all. Thus the Gentiles owned, and one of their Poets &s;aid, <HI>Jovis omnia plena.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God is <HI>Gloriou&s;ly Pre&s;ent</HI> with the Inha|bitants of the Third Heavens. The Heaven of Heavens has in it mo&s;t marvellous manife&s;tati|ons of God. There the Ble&s;&s;ed Ones have God &s;o with them, as always to behold his Face: As Hell is &s;et forth by a &s;eparation from the Pre|&s;ence of the Lord, <HI>&amp; from the Glory of his Power,</HI> 2 The&s;. 1.9 So Heaven, <HI>by a Dwelling with him,</HI> 1 The&s;. 4 17. For as there the Saints are ever with the Lord, &s;o the Lord is with them for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. God is <HI>Graciou&s;ly Pre&s;ent</HI> with his People
<PB N="9" REF="001279_0011_0FB2141994046B90">
here, by being favourable, kind and good unto them; <HI>Externally,</HI> in the ways of his Special Providence: <HI>Internally,</HI> by &s;pecial Influences, Gifts, Motions and Operations of Grace. In|deed, there is a common Providence of God, which Coextends it &s;elf as far as the Creation; whereby he Upholds the things which he has made, and Governs them all to their de&s;igned end: In re&s;pect whereof, God is equally pre|&s;ent with all per&s;ons and people, good &amp; bad. But this &s;pecial Pre&s;ence of God, he affords on|ly to his Redeemed, Cho&s;en and Called, who are not only under the Government of his Pro|vidence, but the Dominion of Grace, and influ|ence of the Spirit. This is that Gracious Pre|&s;ence of God which we ought to be &s;olicitous for, and concerned to get and keep the abiding &s;ence and tokens thereof.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts, (I &s;ay) <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In the Engagement of Divine Providence for our Welfare: Or, God is with us, when he is for us. To particu|larize, Gods favourable Pre&s;ence with any Peo|ple, is manife&s;t in the&s;e Effects.</P>
<P N="1">(I.) In giving them Conduct and Direction in the way that they &s;hould walk. Every man has a Way to walk in, either Private or Pub|lick; In both which he needs a Coun&s;ellor and Guide, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.23. <HI>The way of man is not in him|&s;elf, neither is it in men that walketh, to direct his own &s;teps.</HI> Thro' the darkne&s;s of the Way, and
<PB N="10" REF="001279_0012_0FB2141E10E5F550">
&s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s of the Under&s;tanding, man is ever in danger of being bewildered &amp; lo&s;t if left to him&s;elf. He cannot rightly enter upon, much le&s;s proceed and pro&s;per in his way, that wants a true light. Now this light flows from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord: as <HI>David</HI> acknowledges upon experience, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 118.27. <HI>It is the Lord that &s;heweth me light.</HI> Hence <HI>Solomon</HI> gave this cau|tion and coun&s;el to man in general, <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.5, 6. <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own under&s;tanding; in all thy ways acknow|ledge him, and he will direct thy paths.</HI> Tho&s;e that make their own bo&s;ome their Oracle, God is di&s;engaged from being their Guide; they need him not: but the &s;nares they run into will &s;oon &s;hew them how much they need him. Yea, not only our own rea&s;on, but the coun&s;el and example of others will ea&s;ily mi&s;guide us; whereas the more men depend on God, the more he will undertake to teach and lead them. This is e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary for a man in publick Place; more e&s;pecially if he Sit as Chief in the Land, Country or Province, and be to Choo&s;e out the Peoples Way for them, as well as his own. From an high &s;ence hereof, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the Servant of the Lord being called to take the Conduct of his People <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &amp; lead them from <HI>Egypt</HI> into <HI>Canaan,</HI> makes his Addre&s;s to God for this in&s;tance of his Grace and Favour, <HI>Exod.</HI> 33.13. <HI>If I have found grace in thy &s;ight, &s;hew me now
<PB N="11" REF="001279_0013_0FB2141F3922C520">
thy Way: For wherein &s;hall it be known that I and thy People have found grace in thy &s;ight, Is it not in this, that thou goe&s;t with us?</HI> Gods Servants and People are often brought into a Wilderne&s;s of Difficulties and Emergencies; but if God him|&s;elf be with them, he guides them to a good i&s;&s;ue of them all. And thus his Gracious Pre|&s;ence appears in directing and inclining them to &s;uch a cour&s;e of actions, and method of ma|naging Affairs, as makes for his Honour, and their own Safety.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) In affording them Protection again&s;t all threatning Evils or Dangers. As he guides them with his Eye, &s;o he guards them with his Arm. Such as have the Almighty Jehovah with them, need not fear who is or can be again&s;t them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.31. Gods Pre&s;ence is a <HI>Defence</HI> to his Servants, and an <HI>Offence</HI> to their Enemies, <HI>Gen.</HI> 28.15. <HI>Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goe&s;t,</HI> &s;aith the Lord to <HI>Jacob;</HI> and &s;o to <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 7.9. <HI>I was with thee, and have cut off all thine Enemies.</HI> The Secrecy of his Pre&s;ence is the Saints Pavilion, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 4, <HI>la&s;t.</HI> Herein they may lye down in peace, and re&s;t &s;ecurely, becau&s;e the Keeper of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> watch|es over them day and night, that nothing hurt them. Yea if God be with them, <HI>they may pa&s;s through the Fire, and not be burned, through the Wa|ter, and not be drowned,</HI> I&s;a. 43.2.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) In granting A&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;ucce&s;s in
<PB N="12" REF="001279_0014_0FB214205663FAB8">
their Affairs. To pro&s;per in our Way requires Strength as well as Light. Not only do our Under&s;tandings want illumination, but our Ex|ecutive Powers help or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from God, to perform what is incumbent on their part: with|out this the Wi&s;e&s;t of men wont be able to ac|compli&s;h what they undertake. But if God be pre&s;ent, he girdeth his Servants with Strength to perform their Work, &s;o maketh their Way per|fect. Yea do we not Read, <HI>That out of the Mouth of Babes &amp; Sucklings God has Ordained Strength and Prai&s;e,</HI> P&s;al. 8.2. That is, Has &s;etled a firm Foun|dation for his own Honour in Accompli&s;hing great things by weak and fooli&s;h in&s;truments. As in Spiritual Matters, or in Working out our Souls Salvation, We have an entire Dependance on Him, <HI>Who worketh in us both to Will and to Do of his good plea&s;ure, Phil.</HI> 2.12, 13. So in all Secu|lar Affairs, we depend on the &s;ame Power and Goodne&s;s. What thro' Weakne&s;s or Wilfulne&s;s, the impotence of Mans Mind, or Di&s;order of his Pa&s;&s;ions, and what thro' the difficult circum|&s;tances that attend his Affairs in this World of Mu|tability, Nothing can be done to purpo&s;e, unle&s;s God be his Pre&s;ent Help. In a word, There is no part of the Work &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s that Providence calls us to, either in our General or Particular Callings, but what is above, or beyond our &s;ingle Strength: But if God be with us, his Grace &s;hall be &s;ufficient to carry thro' the mo&s;t Arduous and
<PB N="13" REF="001279_0015_0FB21421D1F70F60">
Hazardous Enterprizes in the World, and that with good Succe&s;s. The Almighty God thinks it enough to &s;ay to any Servant of his whom he calls to the mo&s;t difficult Adventures, <HI>Certainly, I will be with thee.</HI> As when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was &s;ent to De|liver <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from their <HI>Egyptian</HI> Servitude, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3.11, 12. <HI>Mo&s;es &s;aid to God, Who am I, that I &s;hould go unto Pharaoh, and that I &s;hould bring forth the Children of I&s;rael out of Egypt? And God &s;aid, Certainly, I will be with thee.</HI> The like was promi&s;ed to <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> whom the Lord appointed to Succeed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> as Captain General to lead the Ho&s;t into <HI>Canaan, Jo&s;h.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Be &s;trong and of a good Courage, for as I was with Mo&s;es, &s;o I will be with thee, I will not fail thee, nor for&s;ake thee.</HI> All their Victories and Succe&s;&s;es were owing to this Supreme Cau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> The Favourable Pre&s;ence of God with them, As is acknowledged, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 44.3. <HI>For they got not the Land into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm &s;ave them; but thy Right Hand and thine Arm, and the light of thy Countenance, becau&s;e thou had&s;t a Favour unto them.</HI> True and Real Pro&s;perity in every Undertaking, Bu&s;ine&s;s and Affair depends on this Pre&s;ence and Favour of God. The Be&s;t Humane Policy and Indu&s;try will fail without it. Holy <HI>David</HI> retiring off the Stage of this World left this Ble&s;&s;ing with his Advice to <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 Chron. 22.11. <HI>And now my Son, The Lord be with thee, and Pro&s;per thou.</HI></P>

<P><HI>It is a Signal Manife&s;tation, or Token of the Abiding Pre&s;ence of God with any People,</HI> [and gracious An&s;wer of Prayer,] <HI>when He does incline their Hearts, and the Hearts of their Children to Him&s;elf, and to the Ob&s;ervance of his Laws.</HI> That is, in a Word, To be <HI>Religious,</HI></P>
<P>The Sum of all Religion Natural and In&s;titu|ted, may be lookt upon as Comprehended under the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions in our Text; and when the Heart of Man, (whereby the whole Soul is meant) Under&s;tanding, Will and Affections are &s;o directed and inclined, as to make choice of God him&s;elf for their la&s;t End and chief Good, the Object of their Faith and Love, Reverence and Obedience; and his Word as the Rule of All, then may they be &s;aid to be <HI>Religious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="001279_0018_0FB2142C59FEB190">There are many Religions &s;o called, as there are God's many, and Lord's many: but there being but One true God, there is and can be but One true Religion, which is his Revealed Will concerning our Service to him, and Communion with him. There is a Religion if there be a God, and but One Religion, if but One God, who&s;e Will is Uniform. For our Help and Guidance herein, God has not only left us the Book of the Creature, wherein much of Him&s;elf and his Per|fections may be read: But al&s;o has given us the Book of Scripture, in&s;pired by his own Spirit, wherein is the Revelation of his Mind &amp; Will; teaching us more perfectly what he would have us to Know and Believe of him, and how we &s;hould live in Obedience to him. Here are the Decrees, the Statutes and Ordinances of the King of Heaven: Rules to guide us in our whole Cour&s;e to our la&s;t End.</P>
<P>God has put a certain Law into the Creatures, which we call the Law of Nature, in the due ob|&s;ervance of which they attain their End, &amp; glo|rify God. As the <HI>Sun</HI> runs his Race like a Gy|ant, yet keeps his Track to an hairs breadth.

to live unto God: &amp; when it is &s;o, God is with us of a Truth. This is a &s;pecial Fruit and Evi|dence of it. The Truth in this Propo&s;ition may be illu&s;trated by a few Particulars. Briefly,</P>
<P N="1">I. That it was Nece&s;&s;ary, for God to pre&s;cribe a Law unto us, Or, to give us his Command|ments, his Statutes and his Judgments. Whether we are con&s;idered <HI>Apart,</HI> or with Re&s;pect to <HI>Community.</HI> Con&s;idered <HI>Apart,</HI> As a Creature, Man is &s;ubject to the Direction of Gods Provi|dence; but as a Rea&s;onable Creature, he is capa|ble of Moral Government: This Law was at fir&s;t Written on Man's Nature, and that was &s;uf|ficient while he &s;tood in his Integrity to guide him, and enable him to Serve and Plea&s;e God in all things propounded to him. The Law Writ|ten on the Heart of Man was both his Principle and his Rule: but that being obliterated by the Fall, it becomes needful that God &s;hould give a New Law to guide Man to his own Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and to keep him from Erring. E&s;pecially if Con|&s;idered in a <HI>Community.</HI> All Societies of men from the beginning of the World have found the E&s;tabli&s;hing of Laws the only Means to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from Ruin; there is no other way to prevent Confu&s;ion: and would God leave that Society which is of his own In&s;titution, and of which He is the Head, without Laws and Ordi|nances? No &s;urely, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.9. <HI>The Lords Portion is his People,</HI> therefore He will take &s;pecial Care
<PB N="18" REF="001279_0020_0FB2142F51FC6A78">
of them, and give unto them &s;uch Statutes and Judgments, as may pre&s;erve his own Authority &amp; Intere&s;t among them, according to which he will reckon with them hereafter: <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 33.22. <HI>The Lord is our Law giver and our Judge.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In tho&s;e Statutes and Commandments of the Law which God has given us, we have not only a Direction &s;et before us, but an Obligation laid upon us. The Word of God is not only a Rule (for Information) but a Law (for Injun|ction.) 'Tis not only the Re&s;ult of God's Wi&s;|dom, but the Effect of his Legi&s;lative Will; He would not only in&s;truct us in our Duty, but oblige us to perform it, by the One &s;hewing the Equity, by the Other the Nece&s;&s;ity of our Obe|dience. He has not left us at liberty to comply with his Coun&s;els; but has left the Charge of his Commandments upon us.</P>
<P>The Moral Obligation of the Law &s;till lies on tho&s;e that are taken under the Covenant of Grace. [There is an Eternal Obligation on the Creature to Love and Serve the Creator, which cannot be di&s;&s;olved:] We are not Redeemed from the <HI>Service</HI> of the Law by Chri&s;t, but the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> of the Law, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.74, 75. The End of our Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">tion was not to de&s;troy our Service accor|ding to the Law; but to fit and inable us to per|form it according to the Image of God renewed in us, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.24. And becau&s;e our Law is broader, and takes in the Go&s;pel too (which is the Law
<PB N="19" REF="001279_0021_0FB21434E9B640D0">
of Faith) We are bound to take care of all that God has given us in Charge, even all that is A|dopted into our Rule of Faith &amp; Repentance, as well as Moral Duties. <HI>Again,</HI> The Statutes and Commandments of the Law are immutably, and indi&s;pen&s;ibly binding to All Men without Di&s;tin|ction. No Man beggeth Exemption here, be|cau&s;e of his Condition, High or Low, Rich or Poor, Prince or Pea&s;ant. God does not exempt any Creature from Duty to Him, but &s;peaks im|partially to All. <HI>Hear O Kings, Give ear O Princes, Potentates and Rulers of the World, as well as Subjects and mean People.</HI> Yea, the higher men's Station the greater their Obligation in many Re&s;pects. God's Law is a Royal Law, His Statutes and His Judgments &s;o Noble and Excellent in them&s;elves, that we need not be a&s;hamed to &s;peak of them before Kings, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.46. Or to Commend the Wayes of the Lord to the greate&s;t Per&s;onages in the World. <HI>But yet,</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Hearts of All Men are naturally Un|inclined to <HI>Obedience.</HI> Since the fir&s;t man proved a Rebel again&s;t his Maker, All his Po&s;terity (by ordinary Generation) are become Children of Di&s;obedience: Are become naked and de&s;titute of the Image of God, not only indi&s;po&s;ed but a|ver&s;e to that which is good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7. <HI>The carnal mind is Enmity again&s;t God, for it is not Subject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be:</HI> it cannot be|cau&s;e it will not. Fallen man has neither Power
<PB N="20" REF="001279_0022_0FB2143615F5F6A8">
nor Will to Obey God. There is both Weakne&s;s and Wilfulne&s;s in Humane Nature, that it is not &s;ubject to the Divine Will: I mean not Created but Corrupted Nature, <HI>qua talis,</HI> as &s;uch it can|not be reconciled to God, or perfectly &s;ubject to his Law. It may be as to the outward mate|rial part, but not as to the Spiritual and true in|tendment of it, till it be renewed. There mu&s;t be a change of Nature to bring Sinful Man into a State of Reconciliation and Friend&s;hip with God, and to Walk in Ways of Obedience unto him, and his Commandments, not only becau&s;e injoined, but inclined, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.3.</P>
<P N="4">4. This is God's Work: or tis He alone can change the Hearts of Men, turn them from their natural Bent and Bya&s;s to the World &amp; Sin, and incline them to Him&s;elf and his Ways, Remove the Aver&s;ion and Prejudice of the Old Corrupt Mind &amp; Will, Create new light and likeing in the Soul, new Principles, Di&s;po&s;itions, and Af|fections. This is an Effect of Almighty Power and Soveraign Grace: of Enemies &amp; Rebels to make Willing Obedient Subjects to the Lord. Its called, <HI>A Day of his Glorious and Gracious Power, P&s;al.</HI> 110.3. When the Heart of Man does Surrender, <HI>and the Everla&s;ting Doors are &s;et open to the King of Glory,</HI> and All the Powers within offer them&s;elves as Voluntiers, or Voluntarine&s;&s;es in his Service.</P>
<P>This is not brought about by Moral per&s;wa&s;i|ons meerly, much le&s;s by Coaction or Violence;
<PB N="21" REF="001279_0023_0FB21437923ECAA8">
but Efficacious Working of the Spirit of Grace, in a manner &s;uitable to the Nature and Di&s;po&s;i|tion of the Will, which is not de&s;troyed, but per|fected by Grace. <HI>Now,</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. This is a Signal Manife&s;tation of the &s;pecial Pre&s;ence of God with any Per&s;on or People, when he does thus incline their Hearts unto Him&s;elf, and his Ways. Or, A general Di&s;po&s;i|tion to an Obediential Walking with God in the way of his Commandments is a good Argument that God is and will be graciou&s;ly Pre&s;ent with &s;uch a People, and walk in Ways of Mercy and Loving kindne&s;s towards them: or in a word, to Ble&s;s &amp; Pro&s;per them. <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> &amp; <HI>Reformation</HI> are Effects and &s;o Real Evidences of the Divine Pre|&s;ence and Grace, (as the Cau&s;e is argued by the Effect:) Indeed <HI>Repentance</HI> &amp; <HI>New-Obedience</HI> are put into the Precept as Conditions of God's Fa|vour and Ble&s;&s;ing: and tis certain, that God will be with us, but as we are with him, and walk in his Ways. What more evident then this from the Promi&s;e and Threatning Conjunct, declared by a Prophet of the Lord before the chief Ruler and People together, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.2. <HI>Hear ye me</HI> A&s;a <HI>and all</HI> Judah <HI>and</HI> Benjamin, <HI>The Lord is with you while ye be with him, and if ye &s;eek him he will be found of you,</HI> &mdash; Yet not as if our &s;eeking God were fir&s;t, or our walking in Ways of Obedience mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily precede as a procuring cau&s;e of his Ble&s;&s;ing. Alas, &s;o Fooli&s;h &amp; Wicked is Fallen

Man, that if God &s;hould not begin with him, he would never begin with God. Men are &s;o Dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es &amp; Sins they cannot, &s;o habituated and inclined to Evil, that they will not return to God &amp; his Ways, till he is afore-hand with them. If therefore <HI>Religion</HI> be Propagated, or <HI>Reformation</HI> brought on in the World, or any part thereof lying in Wickedne&s;s, <HI>God is found of tho&s;e that &s;eek him not:</HI> our &s;eeking him is a Fruit of his fir&s;t &s;eeking us: and when the Hearts of a People are &s;et to Serve and Obey him by keeping his Command|ments <HI>&amp;c.</HI> its an evidence that He both is and will be with them. When the Body of a People, e&s;pecially a con&s;iderable Part of the Ri&s;ing Ge|neration in any Place, are di&s;po&s;ed to be Obedi|ent and Religious, its a manife&s;t Token of Gods abiding Pre&s;ence there. If a Peoples walking with God, Keeping clo&s;e to his Word and Ordi|nances, be a means to retain his Favourable Pre|&s;ence among them, then the inclining of their Childrens Hearts thereunto, is the mo&s;t encou|raging Token that he intends to take up his Abode in &s;uch a Place; It &s;peaks well concerning them for a long time to come. <HI>That the God of their Fa|thers will not leave or for&s;ake them.</HI> On the other Hand, There is not a more Awful Token of Gods Departure from a Land, or leaving a People quite, then when their Children are Corrupt, and a Degenerate Offspring, that regard not their Fa|thers God, nor have any Heart to his Covenant

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That the mo&s;t De&s;irable Ble&s;&s;ing which can be asked or wi&s;hed for, and pronounced upon any People under Heaven (as a Fruit and Evidence of the Divine Pre&s;ence with, and Favour towards them) is, that the God of Heaven would incline their Hearts, and the Hearts of their Children to Him&s;elf, to Walk in his Ways, to Keep his Commandments, his Statutes, and his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>As it is the cleare&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Evidence of Gods Pre&s;ence, &s;o it is the choice&s;t and be&s;t in|&s;tance of his Favour. Tis an eminent Fruit of Election, and actual Fulfilling of the Covenant of Grace: <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26. They that find the Law written in their Hearts, may conclude their Names are written in Heaven, and that they are &s;ome of Gods peculiar Favourites. Outward Pro&s;perity is no &s;ign of &s;pecial Favour. Indeed, tis no certain &s;ign at all that God is with a Peo|ple in Way of Favour, meerly becau&s;e he makes them Pro&s;perous in Outward things, giveth them Power to get Wealth, and heap up Riches or Earthly Trea&s;ure in Abundance, Suffereth to live at Ea&s;e &amp; Enjoy temporal Felicity; There may
<PB N="24" REF="001279_0026_0FB2143F345385E8">
be a Woe belonging to them, and coming upon them for all this. But when he inclines them to be <HI>Religious,</HI> directs them in his ways, gives Power and Will to Obey him in all things. This argues not only a Providential, but Spiritual Pre&s;ence of God with &s;uch a People. Tis an infallible Evi|dence of his &s;pecial love and good will towards them. For, As the inclination of the Heart is nece&s;&s;ary to Obedience, &s;o is Hearty Obedience unto Happine&s;s, Temporal &amp; Eternal. Not only the Heart, but an inclined Heart is nece&s;&s;ary to true and acceptable Obedience to God. The Heart mu&s;t be framed and &s;et Godward, or it will be impo&s;&s;ible to yield a cheerful, uniform &amp; con&s;tant Obedience to him: But that being once well inclined twill influence and draw the whole Man after it; For the Heart is the Spring of mo|tion that &s;ets all the wheels a working: If God has that, he will have all. Thus the New Heart proves the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing of the New Covenant, as a Fruit of Grace and Fountain of Obedience.</P>
<P><HI>Moreover,</HI> Thus to Obey God from the Heart, is the only way to plea&s;e him, and what &s;urer way to pro&s;per in every thing, &s;ince that wholly depends on his good will and plea&s;ure. The ob|&s;ervance of Gods Laws, Coun&s;els &amp; Commands as the Rules of our living, is undoubtedly the way to live well and fare well in this World and the next. Hence, All the Remaining Proof of the Doctrine, may be had from Con&s;ideration of the
<PB N="25" REF="001279_0027_0FB214409C804B90">
manifold great Advantages and Benefits of walk|ing with God, in a Religious Ob&s;ervance of his holy Laws and Commands, with the manifold great Mi&s;chiefs &amp; Mi&s;eries of the contrary cour&s;e con&s;idered as we go along.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If we con&s;ider Man &s;ingly and in a Pri|vate Capacity, The Religious Ob&s;ervance of Gods Laws and Commandments, conduces much to the Happine&s;s of every One, even in this Life, &amp; that both as to the Inward and Outward Man: In the light and enlargment of their Under&s;tand|ing, Peace of their Minds and Con&s;ciences, Bo|dily Health, Honour, and E&s;tate. The contrary tends as much to their Hurt in all the&s;e. How much it concerns Private Per&s;ons to be Religi|ous and Obedient, The Wi&s;e Preacher has told us in a Word; when he &s;ays, <HI>Tis the whole of Man, Eccl.</HI> 12.13. This is as much a Truth now as it was then, that to fear God and keep his Com|mandments is the All, the whole of Man; The whole of his Duty and the whole of his Felicity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Laws, Statutes and Judgments of God are wonderfully fitted for the benefit of Humane Society: And the ob&s;ervance of them every way nece&s;&s;ary and advantagious to the Publick Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity of Nations, as well as of private Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Matter of the&s;e Commandments re&s;pects either Law or Go&s;pel. That which is &s;trictly
<PB N="26" REF="001279_0028_0FB21445D82BB6B0">
called the Moral Law or Decalogue is a fit Rule for a wi&s;e God to give, and a Rational Creature to receive: A ju&s;t Admea&s;urement of our Duty to God and man. The World cannot be without it. To God, that we &s;hould love Him, &s;erve Him, depend upon Him, and delight in Him, wor&s;hiping of Him at the Time, in the ways and manner appointed by Him&s;elf. To Man, <HI>Ju&s;tice and Charity, or Mercy,</HI> Mic. 6.8. In the Go&s;pel, we have likewi&s;e, this excellent A|bridgment of our duty by the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> Tit. 2.12. Which teaches, <HI>That denying Ungodline&s;s &amp; World|ly Lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live Soberly, Righteou&s;ly and Godly in this pre&s;ent World.</HI> Now, both the moral and Evangelical Precepts of Gods Word are &s;uited to promote the Publick intere&s;t of Nations as well as the Private intere&s;t of &s;ingle Per&s;ons. This would mo&s;t evidently appear by a Suppo|&s;ition of the contrary. Suppo&s;e a Rever&s;e of all that God has commanded concerning the imbra|cing of Virtue &amp; Shunning of Vice: if he &s;hould free men from tho&s;e Laws which him&s;elf has mo&s;t Solemnly Enacted, leave them to their own choice: or &s;uppo&s;e E&s;tabli&s;h the contrary, For|bid us all Re&s;pect to him&s;elf, Commanding us to Wor&s;hip fal&s;e Gods, Transform, and mi&s;repre&s;ent his Glory by Images, Fall down before Stocks &amp; Stones, Bla&s;pheme his Name continually, and De&s;pi&s;e all tho&s;e glorious Attributes which do &s;o clearly &s;hine forth in the Creation; If he had
<PB N="27" REF="001279_0029_0FB2144761417168">
Commanded us to be impious to our Parents, to fill the World with Murders, Adulteries, Robbe|ries, to pur&s;ue others with Slanders and fal&s;e Wit|ne&s;&s;es, to court and take away what is another mans, Wife, Ox, or A&s;s, Hou&s;e or Land, Ser|vant or Child, &s;urely the Heart of Man cannot allow &s;uch a Conceit. Nay the fierce&s;t Bea&s;ts would abhor it if capable of &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion; If Lu&s;ts and Intemperance, Fraud, Rapine, and Violence were enjoyned or but Tolerated, what a World would it &s;oon be? Humane Societies would pre&s;ently fly in pieces, and all Mankind nece&s;&s;arily fall into a &s;tate of War and Confu|&s;ion; But now our Wi&s;e and Good God has taken care to prevent the&s;e mi&s;chievous evils to Men, by interdicting all manner of Sin and Vice on the &s;evere&s;t Penalty, E&s;tabli&s;hing the con|trary practice of Piety &amp; Virtue by a Law. Yea all things required herein, are at lea&s;t, materially fitted for the good of Humane Societies.</P>
<P N="2">II. The actual Ob&s;ervance of the&s;e good Laws, Statutes &amp; Commands, is both nece&s;&s;ary &amp; effectual to the Publick Welfare of Mankind. Tis not enough to have them and know them; but tis the doing of Gods will therein which makes ble&s;&s;ed. Ble&s;|&s;ed Nations or Societies of People, as well as Happy Souls of particular Per&s;ons. The Decrees and Ordinances of Heaven were made and Publi&s;hed for this end to be ob&s;erved; not only
<PB N="28" REF="001279_0030_0FB214490B952238">
to be heard and contemplated but reduced unto Practice. And tis practical Obedience which makes way for the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven to any per&s;ons or people upon Earth.</P>
<P N="1">I. This is Nece&s;&s;ary. And that both <HI>Ex Ne|ce&s;&s;itate Praecepti, &amp; Medji.</HI> (I) <HI>Praecepti,</HI> God has &s;trictly charged the people whom he has favoured with his word, that they diligently ob|&s;erve and do all things which he has Command|ed, and ab&s;tain from what&s;oever he has forbid|den, <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.1. (2) <HI>Medij,</HI> as a means to Hap|pine&s;s. National as well as Per&s;onal, Prov. 14.34. <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s Exalteth a Nation: But &s;in is the Reproach of any People.</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s taken in the Latitude of it, for the whole of Religion (as &s;ometimes in <HI>Scripture</HI> it is) comprehending all Divine Humane &amp; Social Virtues, has a natural tendency to promote Publick Happine&s;s. On the contrary, Sin and Wickedne&s;s does in its own Nature produce many Publick mi&s;chiefs &amp; mi&s;eries. But this will be further &s;hown under the other branch of the particular.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a certain Efficacy as well as Nece&s;&s;ity of walking in ways of Obedience to Gods holy Laws &amp; Commands. The&s;e are propounded in form of a Covenant, to which promi&s;es and threatnings are annexed: That it &s;hall go well or ill with a peo|ple according as they Ob&s;erve or Neglect the&s;e. It is a Doctrine not long &s;ince commended to us from this <HI>Desk</HI> on like Occa&s;ion. <HI>That &s;uch Peo|ple
<PB N="29" REF="001279_0031_0FB2144B120845A0">
and Places as profe&s;s Chri&s;tian Religion, may expect to be Happy or Mi&s;erable according as it goes with them as to Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> That is, As to the ob&s;ervance of the Duties be|longing to the Fir&s;t or Second Table of Gods Law, or their Neglect of them. Thus it fared with the Nation and Church of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> whil&s;t they were with God in the ways of Duty, God was wont to be with them in the ways of Mer|cy, to ble&s;s and pro&s;per them. But when they for&s;ook God, and walkt contrary to him, his way was to for&s;ake and walk contrary to them: when it was their Way to grieve him with their impieties and iniquities, it was his Way to vex them with Various adver&s;ities. This the Scrip|ture declares to be the &s;ettled cour&s;e of Gods Providence, that a Righteous Nation &s;hall be happy, &amp; that a Wicked People &s;hall be puni&s;h|ed even in this Life. The experience of all Ages has made it good.

<P>Tho&s;e <HI>Worthy Gentlemen</HI> that <HI>Repre&s;ent</HI> the People of this Province in a <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> &amp; who have called me (the unworthie&s;t and unfit|te&s;t of all the Lords Servants in the Mini&s;try) to &s;peak on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion as <HI>this,</HI> mu&s;t bear with me, if now I take the freedom to &s;ay, you are indeed betru&s;ted with a very great Power of Liberty and Priviledge from the People you re|pre&s;ent, (as well as from GOD &amp; the QUEEN) to have a Hand in Chu&s;ing &s;o many of their principal Rulers for them: To con&s;ent &amp; con|cur in the making of tho&s;e Laws by which they &s;hall be Ruled; and to the laying of all Publick Taxes upon them. What you do in the&s;e mat|ters, (which are all of very great concernment)
<PB N="45" REF="001279_0042_0FB214686E14FB58">
the People are obliged to &s;tand to. Are not you therefore obliged to u&s;e utmo&s;t Prudence and Con&s;cience in all? Your Wi&s;dom and Fidelity, both are con&s;ided in, with reference to the&s;e things; That you Elect &s;uch only into the <HI>Coun|cil,</HI> as upon good grounds you may judge to be Men that <HI>Fear GOD, and Honour the QUEEN,</HI> &amp; will be true to the be&s;t intere&s;t of this People, both in Spirituals and in Temporals. That then you concur with them in any further Acts of Le|gi&s;lation nece&s;&s;ary to promote the Intere&s;ts of Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Peace in our Land. That you lay not unnece&s;&s;ary Burdens of Charge on the People, con&s;idering their deep Poverty; Nor yet be unwilling to expend and lay out what is nece&s;&s;ary to Defend the Country, <HI>this Principal Town,</HI> the Life, Liberties and E&s;tates of the People in it: And likewi&s;e to &s;upport the Go|vernment Honourably; I mean with the double Honour and due Re&s;pect, &amp; Maintainance or Reward.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our <HI>Spiritual Fathers</HI> in the Churches can|not chu&s;e but be De&s;irous above all other things to &s;ee their <HI>Children Walking in the Truth,</HI> and <HI>Wayes of God,</HI> from a Hearty inclination thereunto. They greatly long for this Fruit of their Mini&s;terial Labours, and Prayers: and to leave this Pledge of the Lords Abiding Pre&s;ence with their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors. I pre&s;ume not to <HI>Direct</HI> or <HI>Coun&s;el</HI> our <HI>Reverend Elders</HI> in any Ca&s;e, but rather <HI>In|treat</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="001279_0041_0FB21466D7EC15A0">
them as Fathers, and ask their Prayers and Ble&s;&s;ings for my &s;elf and Brethren of the Young|er Generation: Particularly, This Ble&s;&s;ing in our Text, <HI>That the God of our Fathers, even your God may be our God, and that he would be with us, as he has been and is with you,</HI> according to the Go&s;pel Charter, or &s;pecial Promi&s;e of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Matt.</HI> 28.20. And help us to abide Faithful with Him both as <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &amp; as <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> Endeavouring to Keep the Truths of God invi|olate, which we have received, and to hand them down along to Po&s;terity. To Keep the Wor&s;hip of God and his Ordinances Pure and Incorrupt, and to promote the Sincere Conver&s;ion of Men as well as their outward Reformation. Re&s;train|ing Grace is not &s;ufficient, but <HI>Regeneration</HI> is ne|ne&s;&s;ary to Salvation. This is Gods Work, but we may haply be in&s;trumental to it: By Teaching the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of CON|VERSION, Making that the Principal Subject of our Mini&s;try or Doctrine. By Being or Set|ting Examples of Holy and Righteous, Peacea|ble and Charitable Walking: By ince&s;&s;ant Pray|ers to God for his Victorious Grace, to Change the Hearts of Men, and cau&s;e them to Walk in his Statutes. This is Gods Covenant with his People, and Mini&s;ters as Advocates mu&s;t put the Promi&s;e in &s;uit for them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> This Doctrine &s;peaks to the Body of the People. Several things,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="47" REF="001279_0049_0FB2147BD1E1FCD8">I. It calls to the Hearty Exerci&s;e of the Fore|mentioned Affections, <HI>Joy</HI> &amp; <HI>Grief,</HI> or to <HI>Thank&s;|giving</HI> and <HI>Mourning,</HI> according to the different occa&s;&s;ions for them.</P>
<P N="1">(I.) <HI>New-England</HI> may yet <HI>Rejoyce in the Lord, and Joy in the God of her Salvation: He that is the God of Salvation is our God, and is in the mid&s;t of us.</HI> Let us Admire &amp; Adore his Goodne&s;s in not leav|ing of us after &s;o many Days &amp; Years of Provo|cation. Be exceeding <HI>Thankful</HI> for what of his Gracious Pre&s;ence and the Fruits of it is &s;een and enjoyed. Thankfulne&s;s for a <HI>Little,</HI> is the way to have <HI>More,</HI> at lea&s;t, to have that continued and Ble&s;t unto us. Were the People of the Country generally more &s;en&s;ible of and affected with the Goodne&s;s of God in re&s;pect of that Go|vernment we are under, and the Gracious Ap|pearances of God with our <HI>Honourable</HI> GOVER|NOUR &amp; COUNCIL, in the good Conduct &amp; Succesful Management of our Publick Affairs, Particularly, re&s;pecting the <HI>War;</HI> I &s;ay, were the Favour of Heaven in this regard more thankfully acknowledged, it would be a probable Means to have the Tranquility of our State Prolonged, and other Ble&s;&s;ings added: <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.2. <HI>When as for the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of a Land, many are the Princes &amp; Rulers thereof,</HI> (either together contending for Supre|macy, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by frequent Changes,) <HI>But by a man of Under&s;tanding &amp; Knowledge, the State thereof &s;hall be prolonged. Moreover,</HI> If the Churches
<PB N="48" REF="001279_0050_0FB2147CE9247498">
and People of <HI>New-England</HI> were more <HI>Thankful</HI> for the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> &amp; Kingdom of our Glorious LORD, that is yet Vi&s;ible therein, for the Liberty of their Religion and free Exerci&s;e of it, without Sub&s;crib|ing to New Articles of Faith, Wor&s;hip or Di&s;ci|pline, and had Wi&s;dom &amp; Grace rightly to im|prove it, they would certainly &s;ee more of the ble&s;&s;ed Fruits thereof. Ble&s;&s;ed be God for what appearance there is of the <HI>Power of Godline&s;s,</HI> for &s;uch a Number of tho&s;e who&s;e Hearts are towards Him, &amp; who&s;e endeavour is to <HI>Walk in his ways,</HI> to <HI>Keep his Commandments, his Statutes &amp; his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) But <HI>New-England</HI> ought al&s;o to <HI>Mourn</HI> for what is wanting of this Ble&s;&s;ing. Does iniquity abound in the Country, and the Love of many (in the Churches) <HI>wax Cold,</HI> and Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity allow them&s;elves in many great Im|moralities? This argues Gods withdrawing, and may provoke to a leaving of us, unle&s;s it be generally lamented by us. This Duty indeed does chiefly concern Publick Per&s;ons, tho' it lies upon all Chri&s;tians, <HI>Magi&s;trates, Mini&s;ters,</HI> &amp; other Officers of Church, and State. Publick Per&s;ons mu&s;t have Publick Affections as well as Relations. They are more Re&s;pon&s;ible to God than others, and more concerned in the Sins of the Land and Places where they have a Charge than others. Among Private Per&s;ons, a <HI>Hou&s;holder</HI> is more Re|&s;pon&s;ible than a Private Member of the Family for any Di&s;orders, and &s;o proportionably in greater
<PB N="49" REF="001279_0051_0FB2147E16FE8538">
and more Publick Societies. Now this is the Di&s;|po&s;ition as well as Duty of &s;uch as are truly God|ly, to grieve and mourn for the Sins of the Age, and Place they live in, and for the number of <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors: P&s;al.</HI> 119.136. <HI>David</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I beheld the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and was grieved, becau&s;e they kept not thy Word.</HI> So <HI>Jeremiah</HI> Weeps in Secret for the Pride and ob&s;tinacy of that Generation. Fit in&s;tances for the Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate &amp; Mini&s;ter. But this is not enough: Except the Body of the People do lay to heart the Sins of the Times, there is little ground to expect better Times, or that they will continue as they are, but grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, more Sinful, and more Mi&s;erable &s;till.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the Doctrine thus applied to our pre&s;ent mixt Condition, calls for the Exerci&s;e of the&s;e diffe|rent Affections; So to &s;tir up <HI>Our Selves</HI> to <HI>Take hold on God,</HI> that we may retain his Pre&s;ence, and receive his Ble&s;&s;ings. The Prophet complains of an Univer&s;al Neglect hereof in his time, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 64.7. <HI>There is none that &s;tirreth up him&s;elf to take hold on thee:</HI> The People were Pining away in their Sins and Mi&s;ery, by rea&s;on of the Lords Ab&s;ence, or Departure from them; the ground of his leaving them was <HI>their not laying hold of him,</HI> and want of &s;tirring up them&s;elves the Cau&s;e of that Neglect. Is not this too much our Ca&s;e? Indeed the A|bounding of Sin is that which fir&s;t provokes the Lord to take up thoughts of Departing; but tis for want of our Taking Hold of Him, that He
<PB N="50" REF="001279_0052_0FB2147F92326E98">
actually leaves and goes away: Not that He is over-forward to take Occa&s;ion for it. Tis &s;aid, <HI>He does not willingly afflict or grieve the Children of men, Lam.</HI> 3.33. Much le&s;s leave and for&s;ake his own Children &amp; People. Nay, in&s;tead of this, There is great Backwardne&s;s, &amp; Lothne&s;s in God, (&s;peaking after the manner of Men:) <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 11.8. He &s;ays, <HI>How &s;hall I give thee up</HI> Ephraim? <HI>How &s;hall I deliver thee</HI> O I&s;rael? Yet the Lord expects to be invited and urged to carry, or return if go|ing: that the Faithful among his People lay hold of Him, and not let him go quite. As the Spou&s;e did, <HI>Gant.</HI> 3.4. <HI>I held him, and would not let him go, till I brought him into my Mothers Hou&s;e.</HI> God &s;eem|ed to &s;hake off <HI>Jacob</HI> as willing to be rid of him; but when he would not let him go, He &s;tays to <HI>Ble&s;s him, Gen.</HI> 32.26. Afterwards the Lord was taking his final leave of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> if <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had not laid &s;trong Hands upon him, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.10, 11. But that Prevented. Does the Lord threaten to leave <HI>New-England,</HI> to give over his Work here? and cannot She find her Hands at &s;uch a time, or has She no Heart to lay hold on Him? This were a more fearful Symptom of being for&s;aken than any other. Oh! Let us &s;tir up our &s;elves and one another to take hold of the Lord our God! And what other Hold of God have we but his Covenant? what have we to do with him in any other way? or what Expectation from him? Is this <HI>Immanuels</HI> Land? Are we the People of the
<PB N="51" REF="001279_0053_0FB214844A2B7848">
Lord? Has he any &s;pecial right and intere&s;t in us? This is the ground of his Care for our Safe|ty &amp; Welfare, &amp; chief Argument for us to plead with Him. Thus <HI>David</HI> Per&s;onally, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.94. <HI>I am thine, Save me.</HI> This the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in|&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 6.9. <HI>Behold, &s;ee we be&s;eech thee, We are all thy People.</HI> More Expre&s;sly &s;till, <HI>Jer.</HI> 14. <HI>O Lord, Though our iniquities Te&s;tify again&s;t us, and our Back&s;lidings are many: We have Sinned again&s;t thee, O thou Hope of I&s;rael and Saviour thereof in times of Trouble, why &s;houlde&s;t thou be as a Stranger in our Land. Yet thou art in the mid&s;t of us, and we are called by thy Name, leave us not, Remember &amp; break not thy Covenant with us.</HI> E&s;pecially when we ask for this peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing thereof, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18. <HI>Turn us and we &s;hall be turned, Convert us, and we &s;hall be Converted; for thou art the Lord our God.</HI> But we mu&s;t Repent of our Covenant breaking with him, Acknowledge our Unfaithfulne&s;s to the Lord, Renew Covenant again, and Return to our Duty and Fidelity. In order where-unto we mu&s;t let goe our <HI>Idols.</HI> God never departs till there be another taken in with Him, or &s;et up by him to croud him out: and God will not continue or ever return, unle&s;s the&s;e <HI>Idols</HI> be ca&s;t away, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14.3, 5. One of the chief of them is the <HI>World,</HI> or our great <HI>Heart Idolatry,</HI> is <HI>Coveteou&s;ne&s;s, I&s;a.</HI> 57.17. <HI>God.</HI> 3.5. But be it <HI>Pride, Sen&s;uality, Intemperance,</HI> or whatever el&s;e, it mu&s;t be put away, or tis in vain to Confe&s;s we have Sinned again&s;t God in
<PB N="52" REF="001279_0054_0FB2148595A1F2D8">
vain to Cry, <HI>Lord Leave us not: Jacob</HI> took Ef|fectual care to Purge his Family of their <HI>Idols,</HI> and buried them under an Oak which was by <HI>She|chem,</HI> when going up to <HI>Bethel</HI> to pay his former Vows to the Lord that appeared to him, an&s;wer|ed him in his Di&s;tre&s;s, and was with him in the Way whither he went, <HI>Gen.</HI> 35. <HI>beginning.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This Doctrine calls us to <HI>Prayer,</HI> to be much in <HI>Prayer,</HI> (in our Courts &amp; Church A&s;&s;embles, in our Families and Clo&s;ets;) and in our Prayers to make this our chief Reque&s;t, <HI>That God would incline our Hearts to Him&s;elf and his Ways.</HI> Is this the mo&s;t De&s;irable Ble&s;&s;ing in it &s;elf? Let us make it the chief Object of our De&s;ires, for our &s;elves &amp; ours. We &s;hould not be content without this E|vidence of Gods Pre&s;ence, and in&s;tance of his Favour, whatever external Symbols &amp; Tokens of it we may enjoy, thro' his Merciful good Provi|dence: But be urgent &amp; in&s;tant in Asking for the <HI>Spirit of Grace,</HI> and influences thereof, to make us an humble and Obedient People: our Land <HI>an Habitation of Ju&s;tice, and Mountain of Holine&s;s;</HI> that &s;o our God may take Delight to dwell in the mid&s;t of us. And would we have the Benefits of this Abiding Pre&s;ence of God Entailed to Po&s;terity, &amp; our <HI>Children</HI> al&s;o to <HI>Keep his Commandments, his Sta|tutes &amp; his Judgments,</HI> We mu&s;t Cry mightily to that God who performeth all things for us &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and has Promi&s;ed this in An&s;wer to Prayer, as in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26, 27, 37. Prayer indeed is the mo&s;t

approved <HI>Medium</HI> to obtain any Ble&s;&s;ing from the Lord, and e&s;pecially in the Ca&s;e before us.
