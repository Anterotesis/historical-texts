<P><HI>Q.</HI> WHY are men obliged every year to pay their taxes?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To &s;upport government.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is government?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The government here intended, is the mutual compact of a certain body of people, for the general &s;afety of their lives, liberty, and property.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Are all &s;y&s;tems of civil government founded in compact?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: &s;ucce&s;sful robbers and tyrants have founded their &s;y&s;|tems in <HI>conque&s;t</HI>&mdash;enthu&s;ia&s;ts and prie&s;t-ridden people have founded theirs in <HI>grace</HI>&mdash;while men without merit have founded their &s;y&s;|tem in <HI>birth</HI>; but the true principle, that all Gentile nations &s;hould found their government upon, is, <HI>compact.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was civil government appointed by the Almighty from the beginning?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It was not; nor was it nece&s;&s;ary until &s;in had intoxicated man with the principle of &s;elf-love. The law was not made for a righteous man, but for the di&s;obedient.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What form of government prevailed fir&s;t among mankind?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Patriarchal. The father of a family u&s;ed to exerci&s;e &s;ome &s;overeignty over his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, until they moved from the city of their father, and became patriarchs them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How long did the world &s;tand without any government in it but patriarchal?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="027215_0003_0FD3DF8E1D47D598"><HI>A.</HI> There was no other kind before the flood (which was more than one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty-five years) nor afterwards till <HI>Nimrod,</HI> two generations after the flood.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What was Nimrod?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He was the fir&s;t that began to be a <HI>mighty one</HI> in the earth&mdash; He was a <HI>mighty hunter</HI> before the Lord; who hunted bea&s;ts to &s;upport his army with; and hunted men to reduce them to his will.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What form of government did he adopt?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A kingly form; for the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh. He was the fir&s;t of tho&s;e pretty creatures, called kings, who reduced others to &s;ubjection by hunting them like bea&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did the Almighty ever give a code of political laws to any nation; or are nations left to act at di&s;cretion in e&s;tabli&s;hing forms of government and codes of laws?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Almighty did certainly give the nation of I&s;rael a complete code of laws on Sinai and in the wilderne&s;s, for their rule of conduct in religious, civil, and military life.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Were tho&s;e laws obligatory on other nations?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Laws, that are in them&s;elves ju&s;t, are binding on all men, but the particular form of many of tho&s;e laws was peculiar to that nation. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of many of tho&s;e precepts was criminal in that nation, which the Gentiles were never accu&s;ed of by their great apo&s;tle, PAUL.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What did other nations do, in point of government, while I&s;rael was in the wilderne&s;s and under the regulation of judges?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When <HI>Nimrod</HI> u&s;urped the monarch's crown, the &s;pirit of domination ran through the world like a raging plague. <HI>A&s;hur</HI> went out of the land of Shinar, where Nimrod's &s;eat was, and built Nineveh and founded the A&s;&s;yrian monarchy; and the con|tagion of <HI>having kings</HI> and <HI>being kings</HI> prevailed &s;o greatly, that every little village had a king. <HI>Abraham,</HI> with three hundred and eighteen &s;ervants, conquered four of them and their ho&s;ts&mdash;<HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> de&s;troyed thirty-one&mdash;and <HI>Adonibezek</HI> cut off the thumbs and great toes of &s;eventy&mdash;Al&s;o eight kings and eleven dukes reigned over Edom, before any in I&s;rael.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In what condition was the nation of I&s;rael, after they left Egypt, before <HI>Saul</HI> reigned over them, in regard to their police?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They were in a &s;tate of theocracy, the be&s;t of all &s;tates when people have virtue enough to bear it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Were there no men among them who exerci&s;ed dominion over the re&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="027215_0004_0FD3DF9255103A28"><HI>A.</HI> Mo&s;es and Aaron exerci&s;ed divine orders among them; the princes of the tribes and the officers bore authority, and the judges, of whom there were thirteen, had &s;ome preeminence, but neither of them had the power of making laws; when God appointed them, they were to execute his laws, and no other.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was the code of laws, ordained for the government of I&s;rael, &s;ufficient to govern other nations by, in their very different circum&s;tances?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It was not: Canaan was an inland country&mdash;the people were forbidden to trade with other nations; &s;o that no laws were made for navigation, commerce, or union; all of which are nece&s;|&s;ary in Gentile nations. And, be&s;ide, their civil and religious laws were all blended together. The &s;abbath of the &s;eventh day &mdash;&s;eventh year and fiftieth year&mdash;the three grand fea&s;ts, and a multitude of &s;acrifices, ceremonies, and oblations were enjoined on that people, which things Gentile nations have nothing to do with.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Has the <HI>political</HI> part of that con&s;titution ever been abu&s;ed by Gentile legi&s;latures?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Abundantly &s;o, among Gentile nations that have become Chri&s;tian; for by bringing Chri&s;tian &s;tates upon the &s;ame footing of the commonwealth of I&s;rael, they have &s;uppo&s;ed that Chri&s;tian nations have a ju&s;t right to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the Heathen of their lands and make &s;laves of their per&s;ons, as I&s;rael &s;erved the Canaanites and Jebu&s;ites: for no better claim than this had the European nation to make a &s;eizure of America. Nor is this all: but civil rulers, in Chri&s;tian countries, have taken the liberty of adopting &s;uch precepts of the Mo&s;aic con&s;titution as &s;uited them; and pun|i&s;hed tho&s;e who would not &s;ubmit, when, at the &s;ame time, they have left unnoticed a great number of the precepts of Mo&s;es, which were equally obligatory.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Has the <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> part of the Mo&s;aic con&s;titution ever been abu&s;ed as well as the <HI>political</HI> part?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, and that to a great degree. The church of I&s;rael took the whole nation, and none but that nation; whereas Chri&s;t's church takes no whole nation, but tho&s;e who fear God and work righteou&s;ne&s;s in every nation. But almo&s;t all Chri&s;tian nations and &s;tates (&s;ince the reign of Con&s;tantine) have &s;ought to e&s;tabli&s;h national churches: in order to effect which, they have brought in all the <HI>natural &s;eed</HI> of the profe&s;&s;ors into the pales of the church, making no difference between the precious and the vile; and from this foundation they have appealed to the laws of &s;tate, in&s;tead of the laws of Chri&s;t, to direct their mode of di&s;cipline. What a
<PB N="6" REF="027215_0005_0FD3DF94D9E64F60">
&s;candal it is to the Chri&s;tian name, to &s;ee church di&s;cipline exe|cuted in a court-hou&s;e, before the judges of the police; to &s;ee cen&s;ures given at the whipping-po&s;t and excommunications at the gallows;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Bapti&s;ts and Newlights have been impri&s;oned, fined, and whipped, and witches and Quakers have been hung in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</NOTE> and for &s;maller breaches, to be admoni&s;hed by a &s;her|iff's &s;eizing and &s;elling cows, &amp;c. or wiping off the admonition by a <HI>pecuniary mulct!</HI> Yet &s;uch has been, and &s;till is the ca&s;e, even in New-England, that has made her boa&s;t of religion and liberty.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Seizing and &s;elling, for mini&s;terial tax, is &s;till practi&s;ed in many towns to this day.</NOTE> Circumci&s;ion, as to its fir&s;t in&s;titution, was not of Mo&s;es, but of the fathers that lived before Mo&s;es, yet it was enjoined by Mo&s;es to be performed on all the males of I&s;rael. From this a great number of eccle&s;ia&s;tics have changed blood for water, and &s;prinkle their children in&s;tead of bleeding of them in order to make the go&s;pel church as exten&s;ive as the church of I&s;rael was. Yet many of them will not admit a per&s;on to go back as far as <HI>John</HI> for the origin of bapti&s;m, becau&s;e (&s;ay they) John's admini&s;tration was under the law; yet they will run back two thou&s;and four hundred years before John for a prece|dent of bapti&s;m.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Rev. Gentleman in the county of Worce&s;ter, who, like many of his brethren, views John's bapti&s;m under the law, contends for infant bapti&s;m from Gene&s;is <HI>ix. 27.</HI> That the law of Mo&s;es was in force while John lived, and open to the death of Je&s;us, I do not deny; but that John baptized in Jordan and Enon, &s;uch, and &s;uch only, as brought forth fruits of repentance, by any order of the law, will be denied until it can be proved. If no in&s;titution ap|pointed before the death of Chri&s;t is imitable for Chri&s;tians, the holy Supper &s;hould be neglected.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was not circumci&s;ion to the church of I&s;rael, the &s;ame that water-bapti&s;m is to the church of Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If &s;o, the following ab&s;urdities ari&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. None but the males were circumci&s;ed; whereas both males and females are &s;prinkled with water. To &s;ay that the females were <HI>virtually</HI> circumci&s;ed in the males, is ju&s;t as good &s;en&s;e as to &s;ay the females are <HI>virtually</HI> &s;prinkled in the males.</P>
<P N="2">2. None were ever circumci&s;ed under eight days old, which was the general time appointed; but children are &s;prinkled &s;ome|times
<PB N="7" REF="027215_0006_0FD3DF94DD019920">
before they are eight hours old. Midwives have been em|powered to do it in ca&s;e death was nearer than a prie&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Circumci&s;ion was never a prie&s;tly rite; but fathers, ma&s;ters, mothers, and friends did the work; but &s;prinkling is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a mini&s;terial rite.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whatever circumci&s;ion figured out, it was &s;omething that was wrought in the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and done <HI>without hands;</HI> and as there is nothing done by men, that is called <HI>bapti&s;m by water,</HI> either &s;prinkling, pouring, or dipping, that can po&s;&s;ibly change the &s;pirit; &s;o neither of them are effected without the hands of men. The conclu&s;ion therefore is, that the fir&s;t did not figure out the la&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. None but tho&s;e who were circumci&s;ed were to inherit Ca|naan; of cour&s;e then, none but tho&s;e who are baptized with water can inherit heaven; which is a con&s;equence inadmi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you think of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution of go|vernment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There is no con&s;titution in Britain&mdash;It is &s;aid, in England that there are three things unknown, viz. The prerogatives of the crown&mdash;The privileges of parliament&mdash;and the liberty of the people. The&s;e things are facts, for although they con&s;ider the &s;eventy-two articles of the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> as the ba&s;is of their government, yet from that ba&s;is they have never formed a con&s;ti|tution to de&s;cribe the limits of each department of government. So that precedents and parliamentary acts are all the con&s;titution they have.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How does government operate in England?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A hereditary king, of the Prote&s;tant faith, mu&s;t always fill the throne, whether he be a wi&s;e man or a dunce. A hou&s;e of lords, of the hereditary mould, mu&s;t always check the hou&s;e of commons.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the hou&s;e of commons?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is a repre&s;entative body of a &s;mall part of the nation, cho&s;en once in &s;even years. It is called the hou&s;e of <HI>commons,</HI> becau&s;e the hou&s;e of lords is a hou&s;e of <HI>uncommons,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;pecies of beings, like the <HI>Genii</HI> of the Mahometans, between angels and men, born only to rule, without having a fellow feel|ing with tho&s;e whom they rule over.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What condition has that form of government reduced the people to?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It has &s;unk them in a debt of more than two hundred and eighty millions; &s;o that the intere&s;t of their debt, together with the &s;upport of the civil and military li&s;ts, impo&s;es an annual tax
<PB N="8" REF="027215_0007_0FD3DF964D8E42B8">
on the people equal to thirty &s;hillings &s;terling per &s;oul, and at the expiration of the year the nation is a million pounds more in debt than at the beginning.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How &s;tand religious concerns in England?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The thirty-nine articles and book of common prayer are e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. No man can fill any office in the civil or military departments without taking an oath to &s;upport them, and upon receiving a commi&s;&s;ion he mu&s;t &s;eal his oath with the eucha|ri&s;t: this is true of all, &s;aving the members of parliament, who are obliged only to take the oath of abjuration, <HI>cur&s;e Pope and Papi&s;try.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But are there none in England that di&s;&s;ent from the e&s;tab|li&s;hed religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Many of them, of various denominations.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How do they fare?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are deprived of &s;uch advantages as the Conformi&s;ts enjoy: In addition to all their pro&s;criptions, the tenth part of all their income is taken from them to &s;upport prie&s;ts that they never hear, and in whom they place no confidence.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is it &s;uppo&s;ed that the articles and forms of the church of England are &s;o perfect that they cannot be mended?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are always perfect when Di&s;&s;enters are handled. <HI>Edward Wrightman</HI> was burnt to death at Litchfield, by a warrant from prince <HI>James,</HI> for &s;aying that the wor&s;hip of God was not fully de&s;cribed in the thirty-nine articles and book of common prayers; and nearly eight thou&s;and lo&s;t their property, liberties and lives in the reign of the merciful king <HI>Charles,</HI> becau&s;e they could not, would not &s;ay, that they believed what they could not believe, and &s;o conform to the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o always perfect when a candidate enters into holy orders; for all of them do &s;olemnly declare that they give their un|feigned a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent to all and every thing contained in that book; and yet, from the fir&s;t formation of that book, it has pa&s;t above &s;ix hundred alterations; and to this day, many parts of it are complained of by many of the Epi&s;copal clergymen.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What have you to &s;ay about the Federal Con&s;titution of America?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is a novelty in the world: Partly confederate and partly con&s;olidate. Partly directly elective, and partly elective one or two removes from the people; but one of the great excellencies of the Con&s;titution is, that no religious te&s;t is ever to be required to qualify any officer in any part of the government. To &s;ay that the Con&s;titution is perfect, would be too high an encomium upon
<PB N="9" REF="027215_0008_0FD3DF97EAF9ADB0">
the fallibility of the framers of it; yet this may be &s;aid, that it is the be&s;t national machine that is now in exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What think you of the Con&s;titution of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is as good a performance as could be expected in a &s;tate where religious bigotry and enthu&s;ia&s;m have been &s;o predominant.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is your opinion of having a <HI>bill of rights</HI> to a con&s;titu|tion of government?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Whenever it is under&s;tood, that all power is in the monarch &mdash;that &s;ubjects po&s;&s;e&s;s nothing of their own, but receive all from the potentate; then the liberty of the people is commen&s;urate with the <HI>bill of rights</HI> that is &s;queezed out of the monarch.</P>
<P>After the conque&s;t of <HI>William,</HI> the government of England was completely monarchical, until the reign of <HI>king John,</HI> when the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was given to the people: this has often been men|tioned in America as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for a <HI>bill of rights,</HI> to pref|ace each con&s;titution: but in republican, repre&s;entative govern|ments, like tho&s;e of America, where it is under&s;tood that all pow|er is originally in the <HI>people,</HI> and that all is &s;till retained in their hands, except &s;o much as for a limited time is given to the rulers, where is the propriety of having a bill of rights? In this view, no &s;uch bill is found in the Federal Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But it is not my intention, at this time, to di&s;pute the point of propriety or impropriety of a bill of rights; but &s;hall only add that the liberty of the people depends more upon the organization of government, the re&s;pon&s;ibility of rulers, and the faithful di&s;|charge of the officers, than it does upon any bill of rights that can be named.</P>
<P>The illu&s;trious patriots of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in framing their Con|&s;titution of government in 1780, prepared a bill of rights, which is adopted in the &s;tate, on which I &s;hall make &s;ome remarks. The bill contains thirty articles, upon a few of which I &s;hall animadvert.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd article it is &s;aid, "It is the right and duty of all men publickly and at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons to wor&s;hip the Supreme Being." This article would read much better in a catechi&s;m than in a &s;tate con&s;titution; and &s;ound more concordant in a pulpit than in a &s;tate-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e there are in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a number of Pagans and Dei&s;ts: the Pagans, upon hearing that it is their <HI>duty</HI> to wor&s;hip <HI>one</HI> Supreme Being only, mu&s;t con&s;equently renounce all other deities whom they have been taught to adore; here their con|&s;ciences mu&s;t be di&s;pen&s;ed with, or the con&s;titution broken. The Dei&s;t (who believes all religion to be a cheat) mu&s;t either act the
<PB N="10" REF="027215_0009_0FD3DF997AEEDA60">
hypocrite, or di&s;regard the &s;upreme law of the State. This duty is called a <HI>right:</HI> if every man has this <HI>right,</HI> then he has a <HI>right</HI> to judge for him&s;elf, and will hardly thank any body for turning his right into what they may call a duty. That it is the duty of men, and women too, to wor&s;hip God publickly, I heartily believe; but that it is the duty or wi&s;dom of a convention or legi&s;lature to enjoin it on others, is called in que&s;tion; and will be, until an in|&s;tance can be given in the New Te&s;tament, that Je&s;us or his apo&s;|tles gave orders therefor to the rulers of this world.</P>
<P>It is the duty of men to repent and believe: to wor&s;hip God in their clo&s;ets and families as well as in public: and the rea&s;on why public wor&s;hip is enjoined by authority, and private wor&s;hip is omitted, is only to pave the way for &s;ome religious e&s;tabli&s;hment by human law, and force taxes from the people to &s;upport ava|ricious prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>What leads legi&s;lators into this error, is confounding <HI>&s;ins</HI> and <HI>crimes</HI> together; making no difference between <HI>moral evil</HI> and <HI>&s;tate rebellion:</HI> not con&s;idering that a man may be infected with moral evil, and yet be guilty of no crime, puni&s;hable by law. If a man wor&s;hips one God, three Gods, twenty Gods or no God; if he pays adoration one day in a week, &s;even days or no day; wherein does he injure the life, liberty or property of another? Let any or all the&s;e actions be &s;uppo&s;ed to be religious evils of an enormous &s;ize; yet they are not crimes to be puni&s;hed by the laws of &s;tate; which extend no further (in ju&s;tice) than to puni&s;h the man who works ill to his neighbour.</P>
<P>When civil rulers undertake to make laws again&s;t moral evil, and puni&s;h men for heterodoxy in religion, they often run to grand extremes. The eating of a potatoe for food, and u&s;ing emeticks for phy&s;ic, were once con&s;idered in France as religious evils. <HI>Galileo</HI> was once excommunicated and bani&s;hed by the Pope's bull, as a man of dangerous here&s;y, becau&s;e he believed in the Copernican &s;y&s;tem. The ancients were treated as hereticks, who believed they had antipodes. The court of Zurich made a law to drown Felix Mentz with water, becau&s;e he was baptized in water. In &s;hort, volumes might be written and have been written to &s;how what havock among men, the principle of mixing <HI>&s;ins</HI> and <HI>crimes</HI> together has effected; while men in power have taken their own opinions as infallible te&s;ts of right and wrong.</P>
<P>The third article of the <HI>bill of rights</HI> is &s;imilar to the &s;econd in its &s;tructure. It is &s;aid, "The people of this commonwealth have a right to inve&s;t their legi&s;lature with power to authori&s;e and
<PB N="11" REF="027215_0010_0FD3DF9D0E49DA28">
require, and the legi&s;lature &s;hall from time to time authori&s;e and require the &s;everal towns, pari&s;hes, &amp;c. to make &s;uitable provi&s;ion, at their own expen&s;e, for the in&s;titution of the public wor&s;hip of God, and for the &s;upport and maintenance of public <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> teachers, in all ca&s;es where &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;hall not be made vol|untarily."</P>
<P>If the legi&s;lature of this commonwealth have that power to in|&s;titute and e&s;tabli&s;h that religion, which they believe is the be&s;t in the world, by the &s;ame rule all the legi&s;latures of all the common|wealths, &s;tates, kingdoms and empires that are in the world, and that have been in the world, may claim the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If dumb idols are called devils, and idolatry is the religion of the devil, this claim of power brings all the Gentile nations under the government of the devil. Idolatry was e&s;tabli&s;hed by this pretended power in the Gentile nations, when the Chri&s;tian religion fir&s;t was &s;ent among them: now if that e&s;tabli&s;hment was right, then the Apo&s;tles were wrong in &s;eparating &s;o many thou|&s;ands from the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. They were guilty of ef|fecting a &s;chi&s;m, and government was innocent in inflicting &s;uch puni&s;hment upon them and their adherents. In proce&s;s of time the religion of Chri&s;t prevailed &s;o far that it was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the empire of Rome; at which epocha it received a deadly wound, which gradually reduced it to &s;uper&s;tition, fraud and ignorance: &s;o that in the &s;ixteenth century a number of kingdoms and prin|cipalities prote&s;ted again&s;t the church of Rome: But this was a grand piece of ob&s;tinacy, if rulers have the power that the article under con&s;ideration &s;ays belongs to the legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The&s;e Prote&s;tants, e&s;pecially in England, retained &s;o many of the Papal relicks, that great numbers became Nonconformi&s;ts: Here they repeated their crime, rejecting the Engli&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment, as well as that of Rome. Some of tho&s;e Nonconformi&s;ts came into New England, and &s;oon began to exerci&s;e that power which the bill of rights &s;ays they have a right to.</P>
<P>Now, how &s;hall all the&s;e evils be remedied? An&s;wer&mdash;All who have di&s;&s;ented from the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of New England mu&s;t return to that fold, and confe&s;s their errors&mdash;Then all mu&s;t return to the church of England and &s;ubmit to that e&s;tabli&s;hment&mdash;Then, joining with the Epi&s;copalians, all mu&s;t apply to the Pope for par|don, and &s;ubmit to his uncontrolable authority&mdash;Then, with the Papi&s;ts, all mu&s;t return to the Pagans, and &s;ubmit to Polythei&s;m. If the <HI>power</HI> &s;poken of is right, then this mode of procedure is right: and therefore, if it is not the natural con&s;equence of relig|ious
<PB N="12" REF="027215_0011_0FD3DF9FACDE57E8">
e&s;tabli&s;hments by human law, to bring all men under the gov|ernment and religion of the devil, it is becau&s;e there is neither devil nor devili&s;h religion in the world.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, that "The people of this commonwealth have a right to inve&s;t their legi&s;lature with this power." But where do they get this right? The univer&s;e is compo&s;ed of a multitude of units; &s;o this commonwealth is formed by a number of individ|uals. The confederacy is the &s;overeign, and rulers are agents; and how can the creature have more power than the Creator? <HI>Propter quod unum quodque e&s;t tale, illud ip&s;um e&s;t magis tale.</HI> Whatever is found in the commonwealth, in aggregate, is found in &s;mall, e&s;&s;ential particles among all the individuals: if therefore <HI>this power</HI> is in the commonwealth, each individual has a little of it in his own brea&s;t; and has a right to exerci&s;e it towards his neighbour, and force him to wor&s;hip God, when, where and in &s;uch a manner as he him&s;elf &s;hall chu&s;e; and if this be the ca&s;e, what means the fir&s;t article in the <HI>bill of rights;</HI> where it is &s;aid, "all men are born free and equal." To be con&s;i&s;tent, either that clau&s;e &s;hould be era&s;ed, or the power contended for given up.</P>
<P>This power is to be u&s;ed to oblige people "to make &s;uitable provi&s;ion, at their own expen&s;e, for the in&s;titution of the public wor&s;hip of God." I have long been of the belief that Je&s;us Chri&s;t in&s;tituted his wor&s;hip; and if my faith is well founded, then it is not left for rulers to do in the&s;e days: But &s;urely nothing more can be meant by it, than, that the legi&s;lature &s;hall incorporate religious &s;ocieties, and oblige them to build hou&s;es for public wor|&s;hip. Pari&s;hes, precincts, and religious &s;ocieties politically embod|ied, are phra&s;es not known in the New Te&s;tament&mdash;convey ideas contrary to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, and pave the way for force and cruelty, inadmi&s;&s;ible in Chri&s;t's kingdom, which is not of this world. If a number of real &s;aints are incorporated by human law, they cannot be a church of Chri&s;t, (by virtue of that forma|tion) but a creature of &s;tate.</P>
<P>This power is further to be exerci&s;ed to require the people to be at expen&s;e "for the &s;upport and maintenance of public <HI>Prote&s;t|ant</HI> teachers."</P>
<P>Preaching by the day&mdash;by the month&mdash;by the year&mdash;annual taxes for preaching&mdash;what &s;trange &s;ounds the&s;e are! not &s;trange in the&s;e days; but &s;uch &s;trangers in the New Te&s;tament, that they are not to be found there. How in&s;ignificant would the federal government be, if it was dependent on the laws of the &s;tates to &s;upport its officers! That government that has not force enough
<PB N="13" REF="027215_0012_0FD3DFA4A5D0ADE8">
in it to &s;upport its officers will &s;oon fall: Ju&s;t &s;o with the govern|ment of Je&s;us. The author of our religion has appointed a main|tenance for his teachers; but has never told the rulers of this world to interfere in the matter.</P>
<P>How much did John the Bapti&s;t, Je&s;us, Peter, James or John a&s;k per year? An&s;wer.&mdash;I know not. If a man preaches Je&s;us, he cannot a&s;k enough for it; the gold of Ophir cannot equal it: If he preaches <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> it is good for nothing.</P>
<P>Strange it is, that men &s;hould pretend to be &s;ent by God to preach to &s;inners; and yet will not do the work of the Lord, unle&s;s they can get men to be legal bond&s;men for Jehovah.</P>
<P>To read in the New Te&s;tament that the LORD has ordained that tho&s;e that preach the go&s;pel &s;hall live by its in&s;titutions and precepts, &s;ounds very harmonical; but to read in a &s;tate con&s;titu|tion that the legi&s;lature &s;hall require men to maintain teachers of piety, religion and morality, &s;ounds very di&s;cordant.</P>
<P>We may next ob&s;erve, that the legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts have not got power to provide for any public teachers, except they are <HI>Prote&s;tant.</HI> Pagans, Turks and Jews mu&s;t not only preach for nothing; but Papi&s;ts, tho&s;e marvellous Chri&s;tians, cannot ob|tain a maintenance for their preachers by the laws of this common|wealth. Such preachers mu&s;t either be &s;upported voluntarily, &s;upport them&s;elves, or &s;tarve. Is this good policy? Should one &s;ect be pampered above others? Should not government protect all kinds of people, of every &s;pecies of religion, without &s;howing the lea&s;t partiality? Has not the world had enough proofs of the impolicy and cruelty of favouring a Jew more than a Pagan, Turk or Chri&s;tian; or a Chri&s;tian more than either of them? Why &s;hould a man be pro&s;cribed or any wi&s;e di&s;graced for being a Jew, Turk, Pagan, or a Chri&s;tian of any denomination, when his talents and veracity (as a civilian) entitle him to the confidence of the public?</P>
<P>The next thing to be noticed is, that the legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts is inve&s;ted with power and "authority to enjoin upon all the &s;ubjects an attendance upon the in&s;tructions of the public teach|ers&mdash;at &s;tated times and &s;ea&s;ons." By which &s;tated times, no doubt, is meant the days called Sabbaths, Sundays, (Sondays) Fir&s;t-days or Lord's-days. I &s;hall not di&s;pute the point about the holy day, whether it was enjoined on men from the beginning, or never before the manna was given in the wilderne&s;s&mdash;whether the fourth commandment in the decalogue was of a moral or ceremo|nial nature&mdash;whether it was binding on all nations, or only on I&s;|rael&mdash;whether
<PB N="14" REF="027215_0013_0FD3CB92D664C5D8">
the &s;ame day of the week is to be kept to the end of the world&mdash;whether the &s;eventh part of time an&s;wers the end of the law, or whether the &s;eventh day is changed for the fir&s;t; but &s;hall u&s;e the liberty of &s;aying, that the appointment of &s;uch &s;tated, holy days, is no part of human legi&s;lation. I cannot &s;ee upon what principle of natural right, the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts could inve&s;t their legi&s;lature with that power; and as I cannot de|duce it from the &s;ource of natural right, &s;o neither can I find a hint of it in the New Te&s;tament, that Je&s;us or his Apo&s;tles ever reprov|ed any for the neglect of that day; or that ever they called upon civil rulers to make any penal laws about it. And it is curious to &s;ee what havock rulers make of good &s;en&s;e whenever they under|take to legali&s;e &s;aid day. No longer ago than 1791 the legi&s;la|ture of this commonwealth made a &s;abbatical law; wherein, for the ground work, they &s;ay, that the &s;eventh part of time is to be kept holy: But how do they calculate time? A man on a journey may travel until Saturday night, midnight, and begin again on Sunday at &s;undown: if eighteen hours is the &s;eventh part of a week, then their calculation is good; but being con&s;cious that it is not, they make it up (i. e. pay what they have borrowed) out of recreation; for &s;uch exerci&s;e mu&s;t cea&s;e on Saturday at the going down of the &s;un, and continue to cea&s;e till Sunday midnight. It may further be ob&s;erved, that the law of God and the laws of men differ widely in phra&s;e: the law that enjoined the ob&s;ervance of the &s;eventh day on the nation of I&s;rael, which came from JEHO|VAH, did not except the works of nece&s;&s;ity and mercy; neither man, maid nor bea&s;t were to work&mdash;but a little ways were they to travel&mdash;a bundle of &s;ticks was not to be gathered and laid on the fire&mdash;nor had they any orders to a&s;&s;emble on that day, in a &s;tated manner, to read the law of Mo&s;es. It was to be a day of re&s;t, which gave it the name <HI>Sabbath:</HI> but the laws of men have &s;o many exceptions, that nothing and any thing are done on &s;aid day.</P>
<P>But however the&s;e things are, the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate is to oblige the people to a&s;&s;emble on the&s;e &s;tated times, to hear the in|&s;tructions of the&s;e teachers of piety, religion and morality, if there be any on who&s;e in&s;tructions they can con&s;cientiou&s;ly and conve|niently attend. Here is a gap wide enough for any man to creep out. If neglecting to go to meeting is not ju&s;tified by pleading inconveniency, his con&s;cience will &s;oon do it; but whether he goes to church or not, his pennies mu&s;t go to the trea&s;urer's pur&s;e.</P>
<P>It is true that on &s;ect of Prote&s;tant Chri&s;tians has as fair an op|portunity to be incorporated as another; but there are many who
<PB N="15" REF="027215_0014_0FD3DFA6E39FD3C8">
ju&s;tly de&s;pi&s;e the idea of religious incorporation by human law; and therefore tho&s;e who do not, have an undue advantage of oth|ers. Suppo&s;ing, in France, the National Convention &s;hould de|cree that all &s;ects of Chri&s;tians, that believed that kings, in certain ca&s;es, might wear their heads and crowns upon them, &s;hould have equal privileges in France; I a&s;k, whether the Jacobin party would &s;hare equal favours with the royali&s;ts? So in this ca&s;e, all &s;ects of Prote&s;tant Chri&s;tians that chu&s;e to be incorporated, may elect their own teachers and contract with them for their mainte|nance, and a&s;&s;e&s;s it upon all within their re&s;pective precincts; but tho&s;e who cannot, in con&s;cience, accord with this legal religion, mu&s;t pay their tax with the re&s;t, and be at the trouble of drawing it out of the trea&s;ury again, which &s;ometimes occa&s;ions vexatious law&s;uits.</P>
<P>Now, if it &s;hould be argued that a great many in this common|wealth believe, in their con&s;ciences, that it is the be&s;t way to &s;erve God, to have &s;ocieties incorporated by law, and levy a tax upon all to &s;upport their wor&s;hip and maintain their teachers, how ea&s;ily the above evils might be prevented, and all enjoy liberty of con&s;cience. If tho&s;e only, who are con&s;cientious in legal religion, are incorporated, and tax none but them&s;elves, there will be no cruel di&s;training from tho&s;e who&s;e con&s;ciences dictate another mode of wor&s;hip. A man can cheerfully work when he verily believes he is doing God &s;ervice; a man therefore who believes in re|ligious incorporation, can joyfully give in his name to be taxed&punc; and he who believes that the law has nothing to do about religious wor&s;hip, can as joyfully &s;tay at home. The la&s;t of the&s;e have as good grounds to judge that the fir&s;t plead con&s;cience for cruelty, as the fir&s;t have to judge that the la&s;t plead con&s;cience for covet|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But there is no need for a con&s;titutional clau&s;e about things of this nature; for if a number of men contract with a preacher for a year, or for life, the bond which they give him, is as recoverable by law as any bond whatever; but the poi&s;on of &s;uch contracts is, including tho&s;e who do not act voluntarily, and perpetuating them upon their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors or natural offspring.</P>
<P>The la&s;t clau&s;e of the third article reads thus:</P>
<P>"And every denomination of Chri&s;tians, demeaning them&s;elves peaceably, and as good &s;ubjects of the commonwealth, &s;hall be equally under the protection of the law; and no &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect or denomination to another, &s;hall ever be e&s;tab|li&s;hed by law."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="027215_0015_0FD3DFA85F3CD768">On this &s;ection I have &s;everal remarks to make:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The fir&s;t part of it is very liberal, to a certain degree; but if it read <HI>all men</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>every denomination of Chri&s;tians,</HI> it would be unexceptionable.</P>
<P>When the Pagans were favoured, by law, more than Chri&s;tians, what deva&s;tation it made in the empire of Rome, in the fir&s;t in|troduction of the Chri&s;tian religion, until the reign of <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> In the three fir&s;t centuries almo&s;t two millions of lives were lo&s;t for con&s;cience &s;ake. The&s;e were men, women, and children, who were as good &s;ubjects of &s;tate as any in the empire. After the change in the empire, when the Chri&s;tian religion became e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, the Pagans &s;uffered in the &s;ame manner that the Chri&s;tians had done in the ten preceding per&s;ecutions. Who can read the hi&s;tory of their &s;ufferings without &s;eeing the bad policy of e&s;tabli&s;hing either of the religions in the empire!</P>
<P>Second. Although the clau&s;e now under con&s;ideration is &s;ome|what liberal, indeed entirely &s;o among Chri&s;tians, yet it no ways accords with a former clau&s;e in the &s;ame article, where the legi&s;|lature is forbidden to incorporate any Chri&s;tians but <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> at lea&s;t, are not ve&s;ted with power to do it. <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> only can be formed into religious &s;ocieties and di&s;train for a maintenance for their teachers.</P>
<P>One of two things mu&s;t be granted; either that Papi&s;ts are no Chri&s;tians, or that there is a partiality e&s;tabli&s;hed. Among little-&s;ouled bigots, who believe nobody right but them&s;elves, who con|fine the Chri&s;tian religion to their own &s;ect, and conclude that they have the exclu&s;ive right to monopolize &s;alvation, it would not be &s;trange to hear that Papi&s;ts, and all others who differed with them in &s;entiment, were no Chri&s;tians: but this cannot be the ca&s;e here. The framers of the con&s;titution were men of in|formation and acquaintance with the world; the re&s;ult is, then, that there is a contradiction in the two clau&s;es of the &s;ame article.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;tate of things in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, that the legi&s;|lature, according to the power ve&s;ted in them by the fir&s;t part of the third article, have made &s;uch laws as have effected a &s;ubordi|nation of one &s;ect to another, contrary to the la&s;t clau&s;e in the &s;ame article.</P>
<P>On March 23, and June 28, 1786. two acts pa&s;&s;ed; the fir&s;t re&s;pecting towns, the other precincts, which effect the &s;ubordi|nation ju&s;t mentioned. The&s;e two laws were &s;omewhat uniform in &s;tructure, and therefore a quotation from one of them may
<PB N="17" REF="027215_0016_0FD3DFA9E681ECE8">
&s;uffice in this place. Each inhabitant has the power of voting in town or precinct affairs, who pays two thirds more in one tax than a poll tax; and then follows, "That the freeholders and other inhabitants in each re&s;pective town, qualified as afore&s;aid, at the annual meeting for the choice of town officers, or at any other town-meeting regularly warned, may grant and vote &s;uch &s;ums of money as they &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ettlement, maintenance, and &s;upport of the mini&s;try, to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the polls and property <HI>within the &s;ame</HI> as by law provided."</P>
<P>Now if any Chri&s;tians but Prote&s;tants are thus incorporated, the con&s;titution is violated; and if none but Prote&s;tants, what may the Catholics &s;ay? But this is not all; by this act, property entitles a man to church privileges. A degree of &s;imony is contained in the act. The wi&s;e&s;t man that was ever born of a woman could not e&s;timate <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> by all the gold and pearls on earth; but here a little property procures it; at lea&s;t an annual tax entitles a man to the rights of it. Whether the&s;e voters are &s;piritual, moral, or profane, they have an equal &s;uffrage in the choice of &s;piritual teachers, who have (or &s;hould have) the cure of &s;ouls at heart.</P>
<P>It is well known that there are a number of Bapti&s;ts in this &s;tate; in &s;ome towns they and their adherents form a majority; but in the greate&s;t part of the towns, tho&s;e called the <HI>&s;tanding order</HI> are &s;uperior in number to all the re&s;t. As the Bapti&s;ts are Prote&s;tants, where they form a majority, they might be in|corporated as well as others, and tax all in the town or precinct to part with their money for religious u&s;es. But it is well known that they are principled again&s;t it. They do not believe that the legi&s;lature have any proper authority (upon the &s;cale of good policy) to make any laws to incorporate religious &s;ocieties and re|quire a maintenance for the mini&s;try. Now the que&s;tion is, Do their &s;entiments prevent their demeaning them&s;elves as peaceable &s;ubjects of &s;tate? Let tho&s;e who differ with them in judgment an|&s;wer. Yet from their known and con&s;cientious principles, how are they reduced to &s;ubordination in various places?</P>
<P>In a town or precinct where the Bapti&s;ts are a minority, the major part chu&s;e and &s;ettle a mini&s;ter; the expen&s;e is levied upon all according to poll and property; the Bapti&s;ts in this ca&s;e mu&s;t either part with their money to &s;upport a religion that they do not fully believe in; or be &s;ubordinate enough to get a cer|tificate to draw it out of the trea&s;urer's hand. Some have conde|&s;cended to the la&s;t mode, as being the be&s;t alternative they had&punc; while others have had &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;t to &s;ubmit to a power, belong|ing
<PB N="18" REF="027215_0017_0FD3DFAD2DCF4B80">
neither to the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, nor the civil govern|ment on earth, that they would not bow let the con&s;equences be what they would. The di&s;training law &s;uits and oppre&s;&s;ions that have ri&s;en from this &s;ource, even &s;ince the ratification of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, need not be mentioned at this time.</P>
<P>One ob&s;ervation more &s;hall clo&s;e my &s;trictures on this article. It is well noticed, that none &s;hall be protected by law, but tho&s;e who properly demean them&s;elves as peaceable &s;ubjects of the com|monwealth. This, however, &s;hould be extended to all men, as well as to Chri&s;tian denominations.</P>
<P>For any man, or &s;et of men, to expect protection from the law, when they do not &s;ubject them&s;elves to government, is a vain expectation. Let a man's motive be what it may; let him have what object &s;oever in view; if his practice is oppo&s;ed to good law, he is to be puni&s;hed. Magi&s;trates are not to con&s;ult his motive or object, but his actions.</P>
<P>Without adverting to Bohemia, Mun&s;ter, any part of Europe or A&s;ia, for in&s;tances, we &s;hall pay attention to a few recent tran&s;actions of our own. A Shaking-Quaker in a violent manner ca&s;t his wife into a mill-pond, in cold weather; his plea was, that God ordered him &s;o to do. Now the que&s;tion is, Ought he not to be puni&s;hed as much as if he had done the deed in anger? Was not the abu&s;e to the woman as great? Could the magi&s;trate perfectly know whether it was God, Satan, or ill-will, that prompted him to do the deed? The an&s;wers to the&s;e que&s;tions are ea&s;y.</P>
<P>In the year 1784, <HI>Matthew Womble,</HI> of Virginia, killed his wife and four &s;ons, in obedience to a Shining One, (whom, he &s;aid, was the Son of God) to merit heaven by the action; but if the court had been fearful of offending that Shining One, and pitied <HI>Womble</HI>'s &s;oul, they would never have indicted that puni&s;h|ment upon him which they did the October following. Neither his motive, (which was obedience), nor his object, (which was the &s;alvation of his &s;oul) had any weight on the jury.</P>
<P>Should magi&s;trates or jurors be bia&s;&s;ed by &s;uch prote&s;tations, the mo&s;t atrocious villains would always pa&s;s with impunity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here add, that in Scotland, two women were brought before the &s;e&s;&s;ions for fornication, one of them was a church member and the other was not. She who was a daughter of Zion was pitied, and the man who had defiled her was judged a vile &s;educer and &s;everely fined; but &s;he who was not a member of the church, was judged a lewd flatterer and was driven out of the pari&s;h, that &s;he might not deceive hone&s;t men any more.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="027215_0018_0FD3DFADC56CA818">Should a man refu&s;e to pay his tribute for the &s;upport of gov|ernment, or anywi&s;e di&s;turb the peace and good order of the civil police, he &s;hould be puni&s;hed according to his crime let <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> re|ligion be what it will; but when a man is a peaceable &s;ubject of &s;tate, he &s;hould be protected in wor&s;hipping the Deity according to the dictates of his own con&s;cience.</P>
<P>It is often the ca&s;e, that laws are made which prevent the liberty of con&s;cience; and becau&s;e men cannot &s;tretch their con|&s;ciences, like a no&s;e of wax, the&s;e nonconformi&s;ts are puni&s;hed as vagrants that di&s;turb the peace. The complaint is, "The&s;e men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble the city." Let any man read the laws that were made about <HI>Daniel</HI> and the three children, and &s;ee who were the aggre&s;&s;ors, the law makers or the law breakers. The rights of con&s;cience &s;hould always be con|&s;idered inalienable&mdash;religious opinions as not the objects of civil government, nor any ways under its juri&s;diction; laws &s;hould only re&s;pect civil &s;ociety; then if men are di&s;turbers they ought to be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Among the many beautiful traits of the con&s;titution of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, the provi&s;ion made for its revi&s;ion &s;hines with great ef|fulgence.</P>
<P>Permanency and improvement &s;hould be mixed together in government. But few nations have ever had patrioti&s;m &s;ufficient to remove the radical deficiencies of government without falling into convul&s;ion and anarchy. There are certain ebbs and tides in men, and bodies of men, which often break over all proper bounds, without a proper check. To leave government therefore &s;o mutable, that a bare majority can alter it, when under &s;ome prevailing pa&s;&s;ion, expo&s;es that permanency that the good of the whole, and the confidence of allies, call for. In this la&s;t view of things, &s;ome real, confe&s;&s;ed evils had better be borne with than to make government too fluctuating. In the federal government it requires two thirds of the &s;tates, or two thirds of the members of congre&s;s, to change the con&s;titution. In Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts the &s;ame, but not till after the experiment of fifteen years. However this may appear to others, to me it appears one of the faire&s;t lines in the con&s;titution; a &s;ignal of a patriotic people, con&s;cious of their liability of mi&s;take, wi&s;hing to improve in policy, attached to energy and freedom. And there is no doubt, but in the year 1795, the citizens of this &s;tate may meet by their delegates and coolly improve upon the con&s;titution, and remove its defects that time and experience have di&s;covered, without the lea&s;t danger of

tumult or noi&s;e. Should that be the ca&s;e, it is hoped that &s;ome things, re&s;pecting religion, will be altered, which is the chief end of the publi&s;hing of this &s;mall tract.</P>
<P>If the con&s;titution &s;hould be revi&s;ed, and any thing about religion &s;hould be &s;aid in it, the following paragraph is pro|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>"To prevent the evils that have heretofore been occa&s;ioned in the world by religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, and to keep up the proper di&s;tinction between religion and politics, no religious te&s;t &s;hall ever be reque&s;ted as a qualification of any officer in any department of this government; neither &s;hall the legi&s;lature, under this con&s;titu|tion, ever e&s;tabli&s;h any religion by law, give any one &s;ect a prefer|ence to another, or force any man in the commonwealth to part with his property for the &s;upport of religious wor&s;hip, or the maintenance of mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel."</P>

<HEAD>A CIRCULAR LETTER OF VALEDICTION, ON LEAVING VIRGINIA, IN 1791.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN LELAND.</BYLINE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Men, Brethren, and Fathers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN leaving the &s;tate, where I have contracted a large acquaint|ance&mdash;where I have &s;pent <HI>fourteen years</HI> of the prime of my life, in which time I have baptized <HI>&s;even hundred</HI> per&s;ons (the chiefe&s;t of whom, God has graciou&s;ly given me as &s;eals of my mini&s;try) it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that I feel an unu&s;ual perturbation of mind; e&s;pecially when I con&s;ider the kind acceptance I have found among the people, as well as the confidence which the Bapti&s;t &s;ociety have repo&s;ed in me. When all the&s;e endearing bonds pre&s;ent them&s;elves before me, they &s;trangely agitate my throbbing brea&s;t. A total dive&s;titure of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations would render me an odious &s;toic, among men formed for friend&s;hip; but an exce&s;s of the&s;e tender emotions, would appear too effemi|nate for a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, and inadmi&s;&s;ible for the hazardous voyage before me.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay that I had any particular call to come to Virginia, like <HI>Paul</HI> to go to Macedonia; but came voluntarily, of my own accord; and hope kind Providence has overruled it for the be&s;t. Now I meditate a return to my native land, upon a principle as voluntary as I came. May Heaven &s;end me good &s;peed, and pro&s;per me in every lawful undertaking. The thoughts of death, in general, are not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> painful as the thoughts of living for nothing.</P>
<P>My friends in general, and tho&s;e in particular who acknowledge my weak efforts as the means of their &s;alvation, will receive this final valediction as a proof of my love; and as I cannot vi&s;it them all to take a formal parting, I hope this letter will be as plea&s;ing and more profitable. When I came fir&s;t into Virginia, I &s;hared the common lot of &s;trangers; many were afraid of me, that I was not &s;incere; and &s;ome better characters than my&s;elf, &s;eemed to defame; but I always was prevented from retorting, by the words of David, "Who can &s;tretch forth his hands again&s;t the Lord's anointed and be innocent:" and amid&s;t all my troubles, the&s;e words were my &s;upport, "The Lord &s;aid, verily it &s;hall be well with thy remnant (of days,) verily I will cau&s;e the enemy to entreat thee well in time of affliction and in time of evil." No man can conceive the difficulty that a &s;tranger in a &s;trange land has to endure, but tho&s;e who have tried it. Thus I was; in the day the drought con&s;umed me, and the fro&s;t by
<PB N="2" REF="027215_0021_0FD3DFB269E11990">
night; my head has often been filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. The love of my God, and the worth of immortal &s;ouls, has &s;timulated my heart and borne me up under all the pre&s;&s;ures of mobs, tumults, reproaches, and con|tentions; and having obtained help of God, I remain until this very day.</P>
<P>The union that has taken place among the Bapti&s;ts has been very plea&s;ing to me, and a continuation of the &s;ame, is an object that engro&s;&s;es my de&s;ire. For this de&s;ireable end, I have been willing to &s;acrifice a number of little peculiarities, and think my&s;elf a gainer in the bargain.</P>
<P>Ye are not &s;trangers, my dear brethren and children, of the difference of opinions now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among the Bapti&s;ts in Vir|ginia; &s;ome pleading for prede&s;tination and others for univer&s;al provi&s;ion, It is true, that the &s;chemes of both parties cannot be right; and yet both parties may be right in their aims, each wi&s;hing to ju&s;tify wi&s;dom, and make God righteous when he judgeth. He cannot be wrong, who&s;e heart and life are right&mdash; He cannot walk ami&s;s who walks in love. I have generally ob|&s;erved, that when religion is lively among the people no alienation of affection ari&s;es from a difference of judgment; and whoever con&s;iders that the devil is orthodox in judgment, and that the Bible is not written in form of a &s;y&s;tem, will &s;urely be moderate in dealing out hard &s;peeches towards his heterodox brother. I conclude that the <HI>eternal purpo&s;es</HI> of God, and the <HI>freedom of the human will,</HI> are both truths; and it is a matter of fact, that the preaching that has been mo&s;t ble&s;t of God, and mo&s;t profitable to men, is <HI>the doctrine of &s;overeign grace in the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, mixt with a little of what is called Arminiani&s;m.</HI> The&s;e two propo|&s;itions can be tolerably well reconciled together, but the modern misfortune is, that men often &s;pend too much time in explaining away one or the other, or in fixing the lock-link to join the others together; and by &s;uch means, have but little time in a &s;ermon to in&s;i&s;t on tho&s;e two great things which God ble&s;&s;es. I do not plead for implicit faith; let each man believe, &s;peak, and act for him&s;elf; but when it is confe&s;&s;ed that nine tenths of the &s;cripture is be&s;t explained without de&s;cending to tho&s;e cutting points, a man mu&s;t appear contracted who &s;pends all his time in di&s;puting about them; and more malevolent when he finds it tends, not to promote love and union, but rather a rancorous &s;pirit. Let us then follow after the things that make for peace, and the things whereby one may edify another, and &s;trive who &s;hall be the mo&s;t humble and love over the greate&s;t affronts.</P>
<P>My children, I am afraid that after my departure, you will forget the weak advice that I have given you; and (what is in|finitely more) the in&s;truction of that gracious Redeemer who bought you with his blood. Wherefore watch, and remember that for the &s;pace of fourteen years I cea&s;ed not to warn you night and day, and taught you publickly, and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. And now behold I go (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Providence)
<PB N="3" REF="027215_0022_0FD3DFB3D17DF760">
to New England, not knowing what things will befal me there. Perhaps the faithle&s;s &s;eas may be my tomb, or I may live to ex|perience more &s;evere trials than ever I have &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>I know my&s;elf to be a feeble, &s;inful worm. A retro&s;pective view of my pa&s;t conduct is not altogether plea&s;ing, and perhaps it is owing to your partiality that I have not been publickly ex|po&s;ed: for my own part, I have nothing to fly to for defence, but the blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the dear Redeemer: but if my conduct has been &s;uch as to e&s;cape the cen&s;ure of tho&s;e men, who know what it is to &s;truggle with a body of death; any calumny that may be ca&s;t on me after my departure, will be unnoticed.</P>
<P>I have preached about <HI>three thou&s;and</HI> &s;ermons &s;ince I came to Virginia; all of which have been too flat, and many of them &s;o cold, that the &s;entences would almo&s;t freeze between my lips; and yet, many times when I have attempted to in&s;truct and com|fort others, I have found the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings for my&s;elf. And now, brethren, I commend you to God and the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all tho&s;e who are &s;anctified; hoping and praying that if we meet no more on earth; that we may meet in heaven among all the redeemed of the Lord: though the company is large, yet there is room&mdash;Many man&s;ions&mdash;Places for you, my brethren, a place, I tru&s;t, for worthle&s;s me.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e, I wi&s;h to add a word in behalf of the poor un|happy negroes, and &s;peak a little for tho&s;e who are not &s;uffered to &s;peak for them&s;elves. I have generally been quiet on this head, for the following rea&s;ons. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I have been a &s;tranger among you, and therefore judged it indecent to meddle with the cu&s;toms of the country. <HI>Second,</HI> I have had no &s;laves of my own, and &s;o concluded that if I &s;aid any thing on that head, it would be con&s;trued to my di&s;advantage, without doing any good. <HI>Third,</HI> It has ever appeared to me difficult to form any plan (even in idea) for their manumi&s;&s;ion, and to expo&s;e the evil without pointing out the way of e&s;cape, would be doing as the witch did to <HI>Saul. Fourth,</HI> To &s;ay any thing about it would rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions of a certain cla&s;s of citizens, and from that they would abu&s;e them wor&s;e than before, and &s;o eventually make tho&s;e in mi&s;ery more mi&s;erable. But as I am now about leaving the &s;tate, I can &s;peak with more freedom.</P>
<P>I am heartily glad, that I can &s;ay that the &s;pirit of ma&s;ters has greatly abated &s;ince I have been in Virginia; it is now confe&s;&s;ed by many, that negroes can feel injuries, hunger, pain, and weari|ne&s;s, and I hope this &s;park of good fire will be rai&s;ed to a flame, in due time.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, that I am not as much &s;hocked to &s;ee them naked, gant, and trembling, as I was when I fir&s;t came into the &s;tate; the di&s;tance that they are kept in, the abject &s;ubordination and things relative thereto do not affect me as they once did (&s;o fatal are bad cu&s;toms) but I can never be reconciled to the keeping of them; nor can I endure to &s;ee one man &s;trip and whip another, (as free
<PB N="4" REF="027215_0023_0FD3DFB515A79C10">
by nature as him&s;elf) without the interference of a magi&s;trate or any being or thing to check his turbulent will. And as I am well convinced that many of my dear brethren have the &s;ame feelings of my&s;elf, I can unbo&s;om my&s;elf with confidence. It is not my intention to drop the mini&s;terial ve&s;t, and a&s;&s;ume the politician's garb to-day; but after adding, that &s;lavery in its be&s;t appearance, is a violent deprivation of the rights of nature, incon|&s;i&s;tent with republican government, de&s;tructive of every humane benevolent pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul, and &s;ubver&s;ive to that liberty (ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to ennoble the human mind) let me a&s;k whether Heaven has nothing in &s;tore for poor negroes better than the&s;e galling chains? If &s;o, ye mini&s;ters of Je&s;us, and &s;aints of the mo&s;t High&mdash;ye wre&s;tling Jacobs, who have power with God&punc; and can prevail over the angel; let your prayers, your ardent prayers, a&s;|cend to the throne of God ince&s;&s;antly, that he may pour the ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>freedom</HI> upon the poor blacks. If public prayers of this kind would rai&s;e the anger of tyrants, or embolden the &s;laves in in&s;olence, let the &s;able watches of the night, in lonely &s;olitude, be witne&s;&s;es to your &s;incere longings after the liberty of your fellow creatures.</P>
<P>How would every benevolent heart rejoice to &s;ee the halcyon day appear&mdash;the great jubilee u&s;her in, when the poor &s;laves, with a Mo&s;es at their head, &s;hould hoi&s;t up the &s;tandard, and march out of bondage! Or, what would be &s;till more elating, to &s;ee the power of the go&s;pel &s;o effectual that the lion and the lamb &s;hould lie together&mdash;all former in&s;ults and revenges forgotten &mdash;the names of ma&s;ter and &s;lave be buried&mdash;every yoke broken, and the op|pre&s;&s;ed go free&mdash;go free but not empty away.</P>
<P>And you, my black brethren, hear a word from your parting friend. It is not only a general complaint, but a general truth, that but very few of you will do your duty without a degree of &s;everity. That your ma&s;ters have right to cha&s;ti&s;e you (while you are their &s;ervants) is undoubted. You cannot conceive what pain, what di&s;tre&s;&s;es of &s;oul your ma&s;ters endure for your &s;ake. How glad many of them would be if you would bear good u&s;age. Their re&s;t for&s;akes them at night, and their comforts by day, on account of your indolence and roguery. There is no way you can honour your profe&s;&s;ion, do a good part for your&s;elves, or move God to &s;end you deliverance &s;o effectually, as to obey tho&s;e who have the rule over you in the fear of God. Though our &s;kins are &s;omewhat different in colour, yet I hope to meet many of you in heaven; where your melodious voices, that have often enchanted my ears and warmed my heart, will be ince&s;&s;antly em|ployed in the prai&s;e of our common Lord. In hope of this im|mortal joy, you may well be patient in your hard&s;hips, and wait till your change comes.</P>
<P>And now may the peace of God, that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, dwell richly in all your hearts.&mdash;Amen.</P>
