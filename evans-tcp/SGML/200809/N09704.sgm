<P>And they continued &s;tedfa&s;tly&mdash;in breaking of Bread.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE preceeding ver&s;es contain an account of the &s;ermon, which the apo&s;tle Peter preached to a great au|ditory of Jews, by de&s;cent, or pro|&s;eliti&s;m, collected at Jeru&s;alem on the day of Penteco&s;t. By means of this &s;ermon, multi|tudes had awakened in them &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of &s;in
<PB N="6" REF="012350_0004_0F88E98CA9B886D8">
and guilt, as, in good earne&s;t, to make that inquiry "men and brethren what &s;hall we do"? Upon which, the apo&s;tle Peter directed them to "repent, and be bapti&s;ed every one of them in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins." We are then told, that no le&s;s than "three thou&s;and per&s;ons gladly re|ceived the word, were bapti&s;ed, and added to the number of di&s;ciples". It follows, in the words of my text, that they "continued &s;ted|fa&s;tly&mdash;in breaking of bread."</P>
<P>THE "bread" which they are &s;aid to "break" undoubtedly means the <HI>&s;acramental bread,</HI> that bread which is an in&s;tituted &s;ign or &s;ymbol, of the "body of Chri&s;t which was broken for us." Some indeed &s;eem to think it was only common bread; but to me it ap|pears &s;trange, they &s;hould give it this &s;en&s;e. It is true, "the bread" the&s;e chri&s;tians are &s;po|ken of, ver. 46, as "daily breaking from hou&s;e to hou&s;e," may mean common bread; for it is joined with their "eating meat" for their bodi|ly refre&s;hment. And, if it is natural, from the things con-joined in this ver&s;e, to under&s;tand by the "bread they brake," common bread; it is equally natural, in the ver&s;e we are upon, to under&s;tand the &s;ame phra&s;e in a different &s;en&s;e; not as meaning common, but &s;acramental bread.
<PB N="7" REF="012350_0004_0F88E98CA9B886D8">
For the other actions here mentioned are &s;acred ones. And as this of "breaking bread" is join|ed with a "continuance in the apo&s;tle's doc|trine and prayers," which are in&s;tances of com|munion in "things pertaining to the kingdom of God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t," it would be un|rea&s;onable to interpret it as &s;ignifying, in this place, nothing more than that "breaking of bread" which is common and ordinary: E&s;pe|cially if it be remembered, that "breaking of bread," meaning hereby celebrating the Lord's-Supper, was a religious exerci&s;e, in which chri&s;tians, in apo&s;tolic times, joined to|gether every Lord's day, with like &s;teadine&s;s as in their attendance on the word preached, or prayer.</P>
<P>IT is accordingly not only &s;aid, in my text, that they "break bread"; but that they "&s;ted|fa&s;tly continued" to do &s;o. The meaning is, it was a con&s;tant part of their public wor&s;hip, one of their &s;tated religious exerci&s;es, a duty which they went on in the practice of; per&s;e|vering therein with the &s;ame &s;teadine&s;s with which they ob&s;erved the other in&s;tituted &s;er|vices of piety. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As "breaking of bread" in apo&s;tolic times, was one of the known chri&s;tian exerci&s;es on Lord's-Days, it may be a&s;ked, is not this a duty now as truly as it was then? And are not chri&s;tian Churches to blame, that they do not "break bread" every Lord's-day, in remembrance of their Lord? In an&s;wer hereto, it is readily allowed, that on Lord's-days, it was the practice of chri&s;tians, in the age of the apo&s;tles, to "break bread", as well as to attend on other parts of go&s;pel wor&s;hip. But I dare not venture to &s;ay, it will follow from hence, that chri&s;tian churches are all bound to do as they did. A di&s;tinction ought always to be made betwixt that which is <HI>e&s;&s;ential,</HI> and that which is <HI>circum&s;tantial,</HI> in any article of duty. To "break bread" in remembrance of Chri&s;t, is <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> a chri&s;tian duty; the <HI>&s;pecial frequency</HI> of doing this is a <HI>circum&s;tance</HI> only, which it may be proper &s;hould be varied, according to the &s;tate of chri&s;tian churches. Our Lord has &s;aid, "This do in remembrance of me"; but neither he, nor any of his apo&s;tles, have &s;aid, this do <HI>every Lords-day.</HI> The practice of chri&s;tian churches in the days of the apo&s;tles, e&s;pecially with them joining in it, is, it is acknowledged, a weighty con&s;ideration, and every way &s;ufficient to put it beyond all doubt, that the &s;upper of the Lord ought to be attended with <HI>frequency</HI>; and tho&s;e churches are herefrom ju&s;tly, and &s;trongly rebuked, who "break Bread" not oftener than <HI>once,</HI> or <HI>twice,</HI> or <HI>thrice,</HI> in a whole year. But to argue from this practice of the primitive chri&s;tians, that it is an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to have the &s;acramental &s;upper every Lord's-day, may be carrying the argument beyond which it will fairly, or ju&s;tly, bear. Perhaps, no practice of any church, or of any apo&s;tle, or of all the apo&s;tles united, &s;eparate from a <HI>divine command,</HI> direct or implicit, is ab&s;olutely binding upon any &s;ociety of chri&s;tians whatever. It may be of great &s;ervice in guiding their conduct, but not certainly ob|ligatory in point of con&s;cience; to be &s;ure, not &s;o in all ca&s;es, and at all times. There may be &s;uch a variety, yea, contrariety, in the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of churches, as not to make that expedient, which is not commanded, though it &s;hould have been a primitive practice, and a com|mendable one too. And it is, beyond all di&s;pute, true, that the <HI>command,</HI> re&s;pecting the &s;acramental &s;upper, re|lates to doing the duty it&s;elf, pre&s;cribing nothing in <HI>par|ticular</HI> as to the <HI>frequency</HI> of its being performed; whether every day, or week, or month, or year. In gen|eral, it may be ju&s;tly collected from the practice of the fir&s;t chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially when compared with tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle Paul, "as oft as ye do this," that he &s;upper of the Lord ought to be celebrated with <HI>&s;uch frequency</HI>&punc; as that it may, with propriety, be &s;aid, it is done <HI>often.</HI> I judge no chri&s;tian church for "breaking bread" every Lord's-Day: Neither ought they to judge other churches, who think, if they <HI>often</HI> do this, it is all they are obliged to, in virtue of any PRECEPT in the religion of Je&s;us.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012350_0005_0F88E98E457A6F70">From the words, as they have been explain|ed, I am obviou&s;ly led to urge upon chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors the duty of "breaking bread" at the Lord's table; and this I &s;hall the more readily engage in, as it is a duty, to whatever cau&s;e it
<PB N="9" REF="012350_0005_0F88E98E457A6F70">
may be owing, that is greatly neglected in the&s;e days. Multitudes of tho&s;e who call them&s;elves chri&s;tians, in&s;tead of celebrating the &s;acramental &s;upper, go from it as though they had no con|cern in it, or as if it were a trifling in&s;titution, not worth their regard. The neglect of "eating bread, and drinking wine," in remembrance of him who died for our &s;ins, is indeed grown a general fault, and ju&s;tly chargeable upon bap|ti&s;ed
<PB N="10" REF="012350_0006_0F88E98F6583BE98">
per&s;ons arrived at maturity of age and under&s;tanding. It is a &s;hame it &s;hould be thus, a reproach upon chri&s;tians, a di&s;honour to the religion they profe&s;s, and an open and &s;canda|lous affront to him whom they own to be their Ma&s;ter and Lord. How different is the prac|tice of di&s;ciples now from what it was in the days of the apo&s;tles! An attendance at the &s;acramental table was then UNIVERSAL among tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. A|mong the three thou&s;and per&s;ons, &s;poken of, in the context, as admitted to bapti&s;m, there was not one that did not communicate al&s;o at the Lord's-Supper; and it was their con&s;tant practice to do &s;o. This noble example of the pri|mitive chri&s;tians, recorded to their honor by an in|&s;pired pen, may, with all rea&s;on, be e&s;teemed a &s;olemn rebuke of that negligence, in regard of the Lord's-Supper, which is now become almo&s;t univer&s;al. And I may properly, and not un&s;ea&s;onably, take occa&s;ion from it to re|pre&s;ent to all that "name the name of Chri&s;t" the &s;infulne&s;s of &s;uch neglect, by opening to their view, in the plaine&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t manner I am able, the &s;olemn bonds they are under to attend as gue&s;ts at the &s;acramental table.</P>
<P>THEY are obliged to this by the po&s;itive command of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the founder of our
<PB N="11" REF="012350_0006_0F88E98F6583BE98">
religion, and the author of &s;alvation. He has &s;olemnly enjoined it on all, who own them|&s;elves his di&s;ciples, to "break bread" in honor to him. THIS DO IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME, are the words of his command: Nor could he have expre&s;&s;ed his plea&s;ure upon this head in terms more plain and explicit. They lie level to the lowe&s;t capacity, and may readily be un|der&s;tood by all that do not &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be &s;aid here, the mind of Chri&s;t, tis true, was plainly enough &s;ignified to his apo&s;tles, making it their duty to "break bread and eat it, to pour out wine and drink it in re|membrance of him"; but it is not &s;o evident, that this command to them was, in the de&s;ign of Chri&s;t, an obligation upon di&s;ciples in gen|eral.</P>
<P>IT is readily acknowledged, the words of in&s;titution were originally &s;poken to the twelve apo&s;tles only; for which rea&s;on, it cannot be certainly argued, from the words them&s;elves &s;imply con&s;idered, that chri&s;tians in general are obliged to celebrate this memorial of Chri&s;t's death. The apo&s;tles might be applied to in their proper character as &s;uch, or as di&s;|ciples only; and whether it was in the former, or latter of the&s;e &s;en&s;es, cannot be determined
<PB N="12" REF="012350_0007_0F88E98FB599B9B8">
by the meer force of our Lord's words, as they were delivered by him. But this notwith|&s;tanding, it is not, in any degree, uncertain, whether our Savior intended, by the words he &s;pake to his apo&s;tles, to oblige chri&s;tians in common, as well as his apo&s;tles in particular, to attend at the &s;acramental &s;upper. For it is to be remembered, the apo&s;tles were infallible interpreters of our Lord's words; in&s;omuch that we may, with intire confidence, depend on the truth they con&s;true them in. And nothing in all the bible is more clearly and indubitably evident than this, that they ac|counted the Lord's-Supper an e&s;tabli&s;hed rite of go&s;pel-wor&s;hip, an in&s;titution of Chri&s;t, that all his profe&s;&s;ed di&s;ciples were as truly obliged to ob&s;erve as they them&s;elves. Why el&s;e was it the practice of chri&s;tians in their day, and by their order, to join in partaking of the &s;ymbols of Chri&s;t's death? Three thou&s;and per&s;ons, upon being bapti&s;ed by the apo&s;tles, were, in one day, admitted to &s;it down with them at the Lord's-Supper; and they "continued" to do &s;o, wherever this ordinance was admini&s;tred; as we read in my text and context. And it is beyond all di&s;pute evident, not only that chri&s;tians in common met together every Lord's-Day to join in prayer, and an attendance
<PB N="13" REF="012350_0007_0F88E98FB599B9B8">
on the word preached; but in "breaking of bread" al&s;o, a phra&s;e that means the &s;ame thing preci&s;ely with their celebration of the &s;acramental &s;upper. And they did this under the eye of the apo&s;tles, with them at their head, and as acting under their guidance and direction. Surely, they would not have thus put chri|&s;tians upon partaking of the Lord's-Supper, and have joined with them in it, had they not known the mind of their ma&s;ter upon this head. It was unque&s;tionably his intention, in the appointment of the &s;upper, to oblige all the profe&s;&s;ors of his religion to an ob&s;ervance of it: Otherwi&s;e, this conduct of the apo&s;tles, who were con&s;tituted by him infallible guides and teachers, will be ab&s;olutely unaccountable. Be&s;ides, it may be worthy of remark, when the apo&s;tle Paul found the chri&s;tians at Corinth in the u&s;e of this act of religious wor&s;hip, he does not forbid their going on in it, as being a duty proper to apo&s;tles only. It is true, he blames them for the irregularities they had mixed with their u&s;e of this ordinance; but not for their u&s;e of this ordinance it&s;elf. Far from this, he &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ures them, as from Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, that the &s;acramental &s;upper was a &s;acred rite of go&s;pel wor&s;hip, in|&s;tituted by our Saviour him&s;elf for the u&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="012350_0008_0F88E9914EC37310">
of all chri&s;tians. And, as the be&s;t remedy to cure their di&s;orders, he relates to them the in&s;tituti|on it&s;elf, and directs them to manage their at|tendance on it in &s;trict agreement therewith.</P>
<P>So that, upon the whole, it will not admit of debate, whether "eating bread and drink|ing wine, in remembrance of Chri&s;t," is an e&s;tabli&s;hed rite of his religion. It is as obvi|ou&s;ly and certainly an in&s;titution of the go&s;pel as
<Q>bapti&s;m in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Gho&s;t</Q>,
or indeed any law recorded in the new-te&s;tament.</P>
<P>THERE is therefore, &s;o far as we regard the authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;ame rea&s;on why we &s;hould "break bread," in remembrance of him, as that we &s;hould obey him in any other in&s;tance of duty whatever. Why do we think our&s;elves obliged to join as chri&s;tians, in ob&s;erving the Lord's-Day, or in attending on the word preached and prayer? Is it that we might be obedient to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is king in Sion? We are equally under obli|gation to celebrate the memorial of his death. This ordinance has the &s;ame &s;tamp of his authority on it; nor are we any more at lib|erty to di&s;regard it in this in&s;tance, than in the other. Nay, if we knowingly, and habi|tually offend in this point, we may rea&s;onably
<PB N="15" REF="012350_0008_0F88E9914EC37310">
call in que&s;tion the integrity of our hearts re|&s;pecting the other. He that has &s;aid, "repent and be bapti&s;ed," neglect not the a&s;&s;em|bling your&s;elves together "for the &s;ervices of piety, &s;uch as prayer, reading and hearing God's word, has &s;aid al&s;o, and in words equally authoritative, "this do in remembrance of me." And if we practically &s;light the au|thority of Chri&s;t in this latter in&s;tance, why &s;hould we think our regards to it are pure and &s;ingle as to the former? The plain truth is, the Commands of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are all given out with the &s;ame authority. And if this au|thority obliges us to obedience in any, it does in every in&s;tance. We have no right to make exceptions, doing one thing, and leaving another undone. The only que&s;tion here is, has Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is Head and Lord of his church, in&s;tituted the &s;acramental &s;upper? Has he commanded his di&s;ciples to "eat bread and drink wine in remembrance of him"? If his will, in this matter, has been plainly made known, an end is at once put to all di&s;pute. It is our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to honour his au|thority, by readily complying with his Com|mand.</P>
<P>AND, I may pertinently add here, there are &s;ome circum&s;tances attending this command in
<PB N="16" REF="012350_0009_0F88E991EAC8CDF8">
&s;pecial, which are powerfully &s;uited to awaken our con&s;ideration, and excite in us a care of punctual obedience to it.</P>
<P>IT is a command that has been carefully pre&s;erved, and faithfully handed down to us, by no le&s;s than three of the Evangeli&s;ts. Surely, the Spirit of God, under who&s;e extraordinary in|fluence the&s;e holy men were moved to write the go&s;pels, e&s;teemed the &s;acramental &s;upper an appointment of no &s;mall importance, and had it in view to bind the celebration of it upon the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t in the &s;tronge&s;t manner. Had the words, in which our Lord in&s;tituted the memorial of his death, been tran&s;mitted to us by one of the &s;acred penmen only, they would have been obligatory upon all who own Chri&s;t for their ma&s;ter; But, as they have been repeatedly conveyed, the obligation is more unque&s;tionable, we are more firmly bound to pay a religious regard to this in|&s;tance of duty; and if we neglect to do &s;o, the guilt hereby incurred will be greatly height|ened. A &s;erious thought this! and it were to be wi&s;hed it might be &s;eriou&s;ly attended to by all who profe&s;s them&s;elves chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>ANOTHER circum&s;tance attending the command we are upon, worthy of particular notice, is, the <HI>extraordinary manner</HI> in which it
<PB N="17" REF="012350_0009_0F88E991EAC8CDF8">
was conveyed to the apo&s;tle Paul. It &s;hould be remembered here, he was not an apo&s;tle, nor &s;o much as a believer, when our Lord in|joined "the eating of bread, and drinking of wine" in commemoration of him. It was after this time, and years too, that he became a convert to the religion of Je&s;us, and a fellow-laborer with the other apo&s;tles in the go&s;pel-kingdom. And now it was that he received the knowledge of the &s;acramental in&s;titution. But how did he receive it? "not of men, nei|ther was he taught it but by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." So he expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ures us him|&s;elf. Says he, 1 Cor. 11.23,
<Q>I received of the Lord that which al&s;o I delivered unto you, that the Lord Je&s;us, the &s;ame night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and brake it, and &s;aid, take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you; this do in remem|brance of me.</Q>
&mdash;The prefixed words,
<Q>I received of the Lord,</Q>
were evidently in|tended to point out the way in which he came by the knowledge of the &s;upper, as a divine appointment; that it was, not by in&s;truction from the other apo&s;tles, nor by any communica|tion that was meerly human; but from Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf. And may it not from hence be fairly concluded, that the &s;acramental in&s;ti|tution
<PB N="18" REF="012350_0010_0F88E993C5C687E8">
was, in the e&s;teem of our Lord, a mat|ter of &s;olemn weight, and that he would by no means have it di&s;regarded? Why el&s;e &s;hould he make a revelation of it to the apo&s;tle Paul immediately from heaven? His taking this ex|traordinary method certainly argues the &s;ingu|lar importance of the duty, and renders it an inexcu&s;eable fault in chri&s;tians to live in the neglect of it.</P>
<P>THERE is yet another momentous circum|&s;tance, accompanying the command to "break bread" in remembrance of Chri&s;t. And this is, the time when it was fir&s;t given out. The apo&s;tle Paul takes notice of this circum&s;tance, and puts a &s;pecial empha&s;is on it. His words are, "THE SAME NIGHT IN WHICH HE WAS BETRAYED the Lord Je&s;us took bread, and &s;aid, take eat, this is my body which is bro|ken for you: This do in remembrance of me." Surely, no matter of trifling con&s;ideration would have engaged the attention of our Saviour at &s;uch a time as this! He would not, at &s;o &s;erious and &s;olemn a juncture, have injoined this duty, and by his own example have &s;hewed his di&s;ci|ples how to performi it, if he had not tho't it wor|thy of particular regard, and &s;uppo&s;ed that his followers would think &s;o too. He too well un|der&s;tood human nature, not to mean &s;ome &s;pe|cial
<PB N="19" REF="012350_0010_0F88E993C5C687E8">
recommendation of the &s;acramental &s;upper by in&s;tituting it at &s;o critical a time. In a dy|ing hour, the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ires of the &s;oul are wont to be expre&s;&s;ed; and to &s;uch de&s;ires the greate&s;t regard is commonly paid. If a command, or reque&s;t, comes from a dying man, e&s;pecially if he is a friend, a benefactor, whom we love, honour and admire, it is apt deeply to impre&s;s our minds, nor can we ea&s;ily hear it with indifference and neglect. Such now, though in a much higher &s;en&s;e, is the com|mand to "breek bread" at the &s;acramental table. It is the fare-well-reque&s;t, the la&s;t injunction, the dying charge, not only of our be&s;t friend, and greate&s;t benefactor; but of him whom we call our Ma&s;ter and Lord. Shall we any of us, after this, habitually neglect the in&s;titution of the &s;upper? Shall we expre&s;s, in our prac|tice, a di&s;regard to a duty, con&s;tituted &s;uch by the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, ju&s;t as he was going to lay down his life for us? How &s;hall we free our&s;elves from the charge of ba&s;e ingratitude to the greate&s;t lover of our &s;ouls, if we reckon it a frivolous rite, or are wanting in our care to pay all due honour to it? E&s;pecially, as it was injoined under circum&s;tances, &s;o pe|culiarly fitted to &s;trike our minds, work upon our pa&s;&s;ions, and engage our religious ob&s;er|vance

of it. May it not be rea&s;onably que&s;ti|oned, whether we mind our Lord's other com|mands, if we can ea&s;ily, carele&s;ly, and habitu|ally forget, in our practice, this, which was his la&s;t and dying one, and delivered with &s;o much particularity and &s;olemnity?</P>
<P>I HAVE hitherto argued from the authority only by which the Lord's-Supper was in&s;titu|ted. If we go on, and con&s;ider the de&s;ign of this ordinance, and the good effects it is fitted to produce, we &s;hall find our&s;elves under &s;trong additional obligations readily to pay our duti|ful regard to it.</P>
<P>WE may be apt to &s;peak of it as nothing more than an injoined ritual that has no in|trin&s;ic value in it. And it is acknowledged, it is not, in it&s;elf &s;imply con&s;idered, a natu|ral, e&s;&s;ential, in&s;eperable part of religion, as the love of God and our neighbour; but a po&s;itive in&s;titution, dependant on the will of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But it may notwith&s;tanding be an important u&s;eful appointment. We have &s;een, from &s;everal circum&s;tances already men|tioned, that our Lord him&s;elf entertained this thought of it; and we may be further a&s;&s;ured of this, from its being his appointment, though he had aboli&s;hed all the rites and ceremonies of the Jewi&s;h law. Surely, he would not have
<PB N="21" REF="012350_0011_0F88E99455380990">
made the "breaking and eating of bread," in a certain way, a &s;acred rite of chri&s;tianity, if he had not thought it highly expedient; if the de&s;ign in view had not been valuable, and the tendency of the thing good likewi&s;e in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>AS to the de&s;ign of the &s;acramental in&s;titu|tion, it was to perpetuate, by vi&s;ible &s;ymbols, the memory of a crucified Saviour. "This do in remembrance of me". The thing meant is, not meerly that chri&s;tians, when partaking of the Lord's-Supper, &s;hould employ their thoughts on the &s;ufferings of him who died for them. This, no doubt, was one thing intended, and expected; and it would be highly mi&s;|becoming, if, while at this &s;olemnity, they did not keep in mind, and &s;eriou&s;ly contemplate, the love of their Savior, who "died for &s;in, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God." But more than this was in the view of Chri&s;t, when he appointed the Go&s;pel-Sup|per. His intention was, that this &s;hould be celebrated, in the a&s;&s;emblies of chri&s;tians, as an open declarative repre&s;entation of his death.
<Q>It is one thing, &s;ays an excellent writer, in|wardly to remember, and another to cele|brate, and &s;olemnly to exhibit, a public me|memorial, by which we not only remember a fact, but avowedly and triumphantly pro|claim
<PB N="22" REF="012350_0012_0F88E994EC659DA8">
our remembrance, and our de&s;ire to have that remembrance ob&s;erved, upheld and propagated.</Q>
In this &s;en&s;e, the Lord's-Sup|per was appointed for a declaration, or "&s;hew|ing forth of Chri&s;t's death." The &s;eparation of bread and wine at the &s;acrament, the breaking and eating the one, and the pouring out and drinking the other, do, according to the nature of &s;igns, figuratively &s;et forth, that Chri&s;t's body was broken and brui&s;ed, and his blood &s;hed as an atonement for &s;in. This is what is meant by the&s;e &s;igns, and they are made ea&s;ie and intelligible to the mo&s;t vulgar capacity by the words them&s;elves, which not only relate the in&s;titution, but explain its &s;en&s;e; as in the pa&s;&s;over, Exod 12.25&mdash;27, the memorial was exhibited, and the &s;en&s;e of it given.</P>
<P>WHEN therefore our Savior appointed the breaking and eating of bread, and pouring out and drinking of wine, "in remembrance of him," he not only intended this as an occa&s;ion for the meditation of chri&s;tians on his crucifix|tion and death, but for pre&s;erving, and tran&s;|mitting, the memorial of &s;o important an event from age to age, even to the end of the world. Thus the pa&s;&s;over was a memorial throughout the whole time the Jewi&s;h law was in force. And thus the Supper of the Lord, celebrated
<PB N="23" REF="012350_0012_0F88E994EC659DA8">
by chri&s;tians in the manner he has pre&s;cribed, is an open public declaration of his dying love, perpetuating the memory of that amazing event, which is the true ba&s;is of all our hopes of forgivene&s;s with God. By means of this monument, the memory of Chri&s;t's death for the &s;alvation of a mi&s;erable world has been hitherto pre&s;erved. and will be handed down to the end of the world. So great and valuable a de&s;ign was in the view of Chri&s;t, when he ap|pointed the &s;acramental &s;upper!</P>
<P>AND &s;hall we any of us be backward in comporting with &s;o glorious an intention? How dwelleth the love of Chri&s;t in us, if we have no perception of a readine&s;s to take occa&s;ion, from the in&s;tituted &s;igns of his body broken, and his blood &s;hed, to keep up in our minds the me|mory of his death? If we can allowedly go out of the a&s;&s;emblies of chri&s;tians, not joining with them in recogni&s;ing, and perpetuating the me|morial of the greate&s;t event that ever took place in our world, and that is clo&s;ely connect|ed too with the &s;alvation of it? We are obliged to nothing, if we are not obliged, in the way of Chri&s;t's appointment, to celebrate the me|mory of his death.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the bonds we are under to ap|pear as gue&s;ts at the Lord's-Supper from the
<PB N="24" REF="012350_0013_0F88E9962072AFB8">
valuable end de&s;igned by its appointment, we are further obliged to this duty in con&s;ideration of its advantageous tendency, &s;uitably regarded. It is an appointment of mercy, powerfully adapted to produce &s;piritually good effects; and cannot fail of doing &s;o, unle&s;s it be our own fault. The bread which is broken at this ordinance is an in&s;tituted &s;ign that has this meaning, the body of Chri&s;t was wounded when he &s;tood in our place, and bore our ini|quities. The wine that is poured out is an emblematical figure &s;ignifying, that his blood was &s;hed for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. And can we eat of this bread, and drink of this wine, in this view of them, and not receive benefit herefrom? The greate&s;t occa&s;ion is hereby given for the excitement, and exerci&s;e, of all the pa&s;&s;ions and affections of the human mind; and if our thoughts are &s;uitably engaged and employed, great good will be the effect; and this, whether we are the &s;ubjects of a common faith only, or of that faith which is &s;aving.</P>
<P>IF we have, at pre&s;ent, no other faith than that which is the re&s;ult of &s;erious inquiry, un|der the common influence of the divine Spirit, which was the only faith of multitudes who partook of the Lord's-Supper, in the days of the apo&s;tles, this ordinance is happily calcula|ted
<PB N="25" REF="012350_0013_0F88E9962072AFB8">
and &s;uited to promote our good. More powerful con&s;iderations to this end cannot be propo&s;ed to us, than tho&s;e that obviou&s;ly pre|&s;ent them&s;elves at the &s;acramental table. Here the love of the Father is figuratively &s;et forth to us in the &s;tronge&s;t point of light. Where|in could he, in a more &s;triking manner, have commended his love to us, than by &s;ending his Son to die for us, while we were yet &s;in|ners? And who, that is in a &s;erious frame of mind, can think of this amazing love of God, and not feel the emotions of affection towards him?&mdash;Here al&s;o the love of Chri&s;t is kindly held out to our view. Would he have laid down his life for us, if he had not loved us with a love &s;tronger than death? And what can con&s;train us to live, not to our&s;elves, but to him, if this love of his in dying for us has no influence on us?&mdash;Here likewi&s;e the ju&s;t de&s;ert of &s;in is, in the mo&s;t lively manner, pointed out to us Would the only Son of God have had laid on him &s;uch a load of &s;uf|ferings, if &s;in had not been meritorious of the high di&s;plea&s;ure of almighty God? And if he &s;uffered &s;o much, while he only &s;tood in our place, how &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we will not be per&s;uaded to leave our &s;ins? The rea&s;oning of our Saviour upon this head is ea&s;ie and ju&s;t,
<PB N="26" REF="012350_0014_0F88F0651A6A8708">
and mu&s;t &s;trike our minds with force, if we will attend to it, "if they do the&s;e things in a green tree, what &s;hall be done in the dry"? Luk. 23.3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. In a word, we have here preached to us with great plainne&s;s, though in figurative &s;igns, reconciliation with God through the death of Chri&s;t, and complete &s;alvation in eternal Glory, notwith&s;tanding all our pa&s;t &s;ins, however multiplied, or aggravated, they may have been. And how lo&s;t mu&s;t we be to all ingenuity and &s;en&s;e of gratitude, if, by &s;uch con&s;iderations, that "godly &s;orrow" for &s;in is not produced in us, which is accompained with "repentance unto life, never to be repented of"? Many, without all doubt, in apo&s;tolic days, and in every age &s;ince, by means of what has been &s;ugge&s;ted to their minds at the table of the Lord, and impre&s;&s;ed on them by his Spirit, have been turned from vi&s;ible chri&s;tians only, to tho&s;e that are chri&s;tians in the real temper of their hearts. And what has been may be again. The ordinance of the &s;upper is admirably well adapted to promote the edifica|tion of all that come to it in the &s;erious exer|ci&s;e of faith, though their faith, at pre&s;ent, &s;hould not be &s;uch as will argue their being "born from above".&mdash;</P>
<P>AND as to tho&s;e who are already partakers
<PB N="27" REF="012350_0014_0F88F0651A6A8708">
of the grace of God in truth, their is nothing in chri&s;tianity better &s;uited to help forward their growth in the divine life, than their at|tendance at the &s;acramental &s;upper in a &s;erious, devout and con&s;iderate manner. It is by the dying love of Chri&s;t, duly impre&s;&s;ed on the mind by the Holy Gho&s;t, that holy di&s;po&s;itions are both begun, maintained, increa&s;ed, and perfected in the Soul. And what more effec|tual means could have been devi&s;ed to awaken in us a &s;en&s;e of this love of Chri&s;t, and keep it in a vigorous lively &s;tate, than our partaking of that bread and wine which are in&s;tituted &s;ymbols of his body broken, and blood &s;hed, for our pardon and &s;alvation? If, in the exerci&s;e of faith, we employ our thoughts on tho&s;e amazing objects that are here offered to contemplation, it mu&s;t tend, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, to &s;often our hearts, inflame our af|fections, &s;trengthen our graces, and e&s;tabli&s;h our minds in all chri&s;tian virtue; e&s;pecially, as we may here expect the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with us, by his Spirit, to guide our thoughts, a&s;&s;i&s;t our meditations, govern our views, en|courage our hopes, comfort our hearts, and confirm in us the principles of goodne&s;s. Per|haps, the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us is never more pre&s;ent with the true chri&s;tian, to the purpo&s;es of &s;piri|tual
<PB N="28" REF="012350_0015_0F88F066C35B3508">
light, love, joy and increa&s;e of holine&s;s, than when he is at his table in a right frame of &s;oul. I doubt not, there are tho&s;e now pre|&s;ent who can &s;peak of &s;pecial manife&s;tations of their Savior at this ordinance, enlarging their views of the divine glory, invigorating their graces, and &s;trengthening their feeble minds, &s;o as that they have been able to run in the chri&s;tian race, and not be weary; to walk and not faint.&mdash;</P>
<P>So that if we have any concern for the wel|fare of our &s;ouls; if we de&s;ire they &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the grace of God, or improved and e&s;tabli&s;hed in it, we mu&s;t needs think our&s;elves obliged to celebrate the memorial of Chri&s;t's dying love; as this is an in&s;tituted mean &s;o powerfully &s;itted to produce the&s;e good effects.</P>
<P>IT is, I am ready to think very much owing to the neglect of the Lord's Supper, that there is &s;o little religion to be &s;een among us. While chri&s;tians, &s;o called, do generally, and allow|edly expre&s;s, in their practice, a di&s;regard to their duty in this in&s;tance, it is no more than may be expected, that they &s;hould neglect it in another, and &s;o on until they are got into an habit of indifference to all religion. It is likewi&s;e very much owing to the neglect of this ordinance, or a carele&s;s &s;lighty manner of
<PB N="29" REF="012350_0015_0F88F066C35B3508">
attending on it, that there are &s;o many &s;pirit|ually poor, weak chri&s;tians among us. No wonder per&s;ons &s;hould continue "babes in Chri&s;t", if they do not u&s;e this mean of growth, or, if they u&s;e it, do it in an overtly &s;uperficial manner.&mdash;It is owing to this &s;ame cau&s;e al&s;o, in a great mea&s;ure, that there are &s;o many chri&s;tians, who conflict with doubts and fears, being &s;trangers to that comfortable hope to|wards God without which there can be no true enjoyment of life; and how &s;hould it be other|wi&s;e, if they will not wait upon Chri&s;t, in this way of his appointment, for tho&s;e manife&s;tati|ons of his love which &s;hall &s;catter their fears, and &s;et their minds at re&s;t? It may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether religion will ever flouri&s;h among us, until this in&s;titution of Chri&s;t is more generally attended, and with due care and con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I SHALL &s;ubjoin here &s;till further to excite our regard to the &s;acramental &s;upper, that it is a vi&s;ible mark, &s;ign, or badge of the chri&s;t|ian profe&s;&s;ion. The wi&s;dom of God has al|ways &s;een fit, under all the di&s;pen&s;ations of his kingdom, to appoint &s;ome &s;acred vi&s;ible rite, as a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark pointing out his profe&s;&s;ing people. Circumci&s;ion was the in&s;tituted rite of di&s;tinction, to the &s;eed of
<PB N="30" REF="012350_0016_0F88F0676C6109C8">
Abraham after the fle&s;h. In addition hereto, the pa&s;&s;over, under the law, was appointed, among other ends to be a &s;ign between God, and the nation of the Jews, that is, a public &s;olemn rite by which they might be known to be his people, in di&s;tinction from the other nations of the earth. And of &s;uch importance were the&s;e in&s;tituted rites, to the e&s;teem of God, that the de&s;pi&s;ers of them were peremptorily ordered by his authority to "be cut off from his people"; as not having their proper mark, and therefore no right to their advantages. Chri&s;tianity al&s;o has its di&s;tingui&s;hing rites. Meeting together for "&s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks," and the like public exerci&s;es of piety, are not peculiar to the religion of Je&s;us, but common to every other. Bapti&s;m, and the Lord's-Supper, are the &s;acred vi&s;ible rites by which Chri&s;t would have his di&s;ciples and followers known to be &s;uch in di&s;tinction from the re&s;t of the world. By bapti&s;m, which can be received but once, agreably to the mind of our Savior, they are initiated di&s;ciples; but it is principally by celebrating the Lord's-Supper, and doing it frequently in a &s;tated cour&s;e, that they are di&s;|tingui&s;hed as his followers. By this they were known as &s;uch in the days of the apo&s;tles.
<PB N="31" REF="012350_0016_0F88F0676C6109C8">
Their a&s;&s;embling together to "break bread" was their appropriate character, and pointed them out as the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. And &s;o it ought to be now. We &s;hould be known to be chri&s;tians by having communion in the em|blems of Chri&s;t's body and blood. A crucified Chri&s;t is the true ba&s;is of the religion of Je&s;us, in di&s;tinction from every other; and the pub|lic &s;olemn celebration of him in this character, in the way he has appointed, is the proper di&s;tinctive mark of our profe&s;&s;ion as his di&s;ci|ples. By this we "glory in the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t", proclaiming our adherance to him, and that we have no hope towards God but through him. But if we are neglecters of the Lord's-Supper, we declare virtually, and in reality of &s;en&s;e, that we are a&s;hamed of the proper chri&s;ti|an badge. And what ever el&s;e we do in reli|gion, we leave that undone which is the in&s;titu|ted vi&s;ible mark to di&s;tingui&s;h us as Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>I HAVE now &s;aid all that I intended in illu&s;tration of the bonds we are under to "break bread" as Chri&s;t has commanded.</P>
<P>LET what has been offered, be &s;eriou&s;ly re|flected on by tho&s;e who have made it their practice to treat the table of the Lord with

neglect, not to &s;ay con&s;tructive contempt. You have violated the &s;tronge&s;t bonds, and mu&s;t be convinced of it, if you will but con&s;ider. Is not the &s;upper of the Lord a plain in&s;titution of the go&s;pel? Has not Je|&s;us Chri&s;t peremptorily &s;aid "do this in re|membrance of me"? Can you call in que&s;tion the truth of this command? Have you not as good rea&s;on to believe, that he has in&s;ti|tuted the &s;acramental &s;upper, as bapti&s;m, or the duty of attending to the word preached? And will you notwith&s;tanding pay no regard to this go&s;pel ordinance? Is he not the con|&s;tituted &s;overeign in the kingdom of grace? Do you not call him Ma&s;ter and Lord? And is he not your Savior, as well as Lawgiver and Judge? Has he not died a &s;acrifice to atone for your &s;ins? Have you any hope of the pardoning mercy of God, but through the merit of his blood, that blood of his, this in&s;titution is a memorial of. And will you, in oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e con&s;training motives, go on in the neglect of it? God forbid that you &s;hould any longer di&s;regard the authority of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and betray ingratitude to him for his a&s;toni&s;h|ing love, by taking no practical notice of his dying reque&s;t to his di&s;ciples and followers.</P>

<P>I AM, in the fir&s;t place, to addre&s;s a few words to the &s;ecurely wicked, tho&s;e who lead a vicious and ungodly life, love the ways of &s;in, and walk in them, not perceiving within them&s;elves an Inclination to cea&s;e from doing evil, but a di&s;po&s;ition and re&s;olution rather to go on in the practice of iniquity.

<P>IT is not expected of you, nor indeed de|&s;ired, that you would, in your pre&s;ent temper of mind, come to the table of the Lord. It would be a prophanation of that which is &s;a|cred for per&s;ons of your character to partake of the &s;ymbols of Chri&s;t's body and blood; and &s;hould you attend any other &s;ervice of piety, it would be only for fa&s;hion's &s;ake, and in hypocri&s;y. You are the wicked ones of whom it is declared, in the &s;acred books, that "their prayers are an abomination to the Lord", You are the &s;inners, of whom the holy God makes that demand, "when ye come to ap|pear

But remember, though the wicked &s;tate you are allowedly in is a good rea&s;on, why you &s;hould not dare to partake of the Lord's Supper, it is, at the &s;ame time, a rea&s;on that will render you &s;peechle&s;s, when you are called to &s;tand before the bar of the coming judgment. Far from cancelling your obligations to this duty, it heinou&s;ly aggravates your guilt in the neglect of it.

If it &s;hall plea&s;e the father of mercies, and God of all grace, to alarm your fears, roufe your con&s;ci|ences, and put you upon &s;eeking to him in real earne&s;t to compa&s;ionate your ca&s;e, there will be hope concerning you. You may, if he &s;hould graciou&s;ly do this, with propriety u&s;e the appointed means in order to a "deliver|ance from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of God"; and you may do it, humbly hopeing for &s;ucce&s;s, through him who has been the propitiation for the &s;ins of men.</P>
<P>THE carele&s;s and indifferent are nextly to be applied to; by whom I intend, not tho&s;e who have no &s;en&s;e of religion, and pay no regard at all to it, making &s;in, in one &s;hape or another, their habitual allowed practice: The&s;e are not the per&s;ons I have here in view; but tho&s;e, who, though they may have &s;ome perceptions of the bonds of God that are upon them, are yet the &s;ubject of them in a tran&s;ient way only, and this in a low feeble degree, &s;o as that they have no
<PB N="38" REF="012350_0020_0F88F06E96C18FC0">
power to form their temper, or thoroughly touch their con&s;cience. Their proper cha|racter is, not that they are totally thought|le&s;s, but in&s;ufficiently &s;o; not that they are altogether unconcerned about the affairs of their &s;ouls and another world, but their con|cern about the&s;e infinitely important matters is light and incon&s;iderable; not that they never have any religious motions working in them, but they are weak, fluctuating and ineffectual; in&s;omuch that they can indulge to carele&s;sne&s;s in regard of the duties of pie|ty, and yet keep their minds in ea&s;e and peace; yea, they can live in the habitual neglect of them, or, which is as bad, a meer formal, cu&s;tomary performance of them, and perceive no unea&s;ine&s;s on this account. Many there are, and among tho&s;e too who would take it ill not to be called chri&s;ti|ans, who&s;e ju&s;t character has been here de|lineated, To &s;uch it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ay,</P>
<P>YOUR great unhappine&s;s is, that religion has taken no fa&s;t hold of your hearts. You are not only &s;trangers to the power of god|line&s;s but to that &s;tate of mind that is on|ly introductory to it. It is &s;eldom, if ever, that per&s;ons take up the practice of religion with engagedne&s;s of heart, until they have
<PB N="39" REF="012350_0020_0F88F06E96C18FC0">
fir&s;t had excited in them &s;uch perceptions of God, and their obligations to him, as are incompatible with that indifferency of &s;pirit which di&s;tingui&s;hes the per&s;ons to whom I am now &s;peaking. In&s;tead therefore of be|ing chri&s;tians in truth, you have not as yet attained to that &s;erious &s;tate of mind, that &s;en&s;e of God, of &s;in and holine&s;s, which are common to tho&s;e who are but ju&s;t entering upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion in good earne&s;t.</P>
<P>THE proper advice to you is, to endea|vour, in all &s;utable ways, to get awakened in you a becoming concern about the infinitely intere&s;ting affairs of your &s;ouls, and everla&s;t|ing &s;alvation. Without this, if you do any thing in religion it will be a lip-&s;ervice only. If you "honor God with your mouths, your hearts will be far from him". And, per|haps, duty thus performed, had as well been omitted. Be &s;ure, the &s;upper of the Lord &s;hould not be attended in this &s;leighty, &s;u|perficial, not to &s;ay hypocritical manner. It would be a di&s;honor to the memory of Chri&s;t's dying love, and of no &s;ervice to tho&s;e, who in this heedle&s;s way, &s;hould join in the celebration of it. Not that per&s;ons will be di&s;charged from guilt, if they neglect duty in general, or the duty of partaking of the
<PB N="40" REF="012350_0021_0F88F06F8FFB33A8">
&s;acramental &s;upper in particular, on account of the incon&s;iderate unconcerned frame of mind they are habitually in. This would be to &s;uppo&s;e, that one &s;in might be an ex|cu&s;e for another, than which nothing is more palpably ab&s;urd. Your &s;in, in neglecting your duty, will be the more heinous in God's &s;ight, as taking ri&s;e from &s;o bad a cau&s;e as that of a thoughtle&s;s &s;tate of &s;oul, rendering you un|meet for the performance of it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing therefore proper for you is, to pay regard to that in&s;pired direction, "con|&s;ider, and &s;hew your&s;elves men". Make u&s;e of the power of reflection you are endow|ed with, and is your di&s;tingui&s;hing glory as men, rea&s;onable creatures. And be much in the exerci&s;e of it; taking off your thoughts from the world, its vanities, gayities, amu&s;e|ments, riches and plea&s;ures, and employing them on tho&s;e &s;piritual objects that will tend to &s;often your hearts, warm your affections, and animate your re&s;olutions and endeavors. Without this care, it will be impo&s;&s;ible, hu|manly &s;peaking, but that you &s;hould remain de&s;titute of any lively &s;en&s;e of God and reli|gion, and indifferent to things of a &s;piritual nature. It is by meditation, &s;erious, frequent, devout meditation, that the mind is impre&s;|&s;ed,
<PB N="41" REF="012350_0021_0F88F06F8FFB33A8">
and a concern about the "one thing needful" at fir&s;t excited, and afterwards main|tained and cheri&s;hed. And you can be at no lo&s;s for objects, which, if &s;olemnly medi|tated on, in the exerci&s;e of a rational faith only, would mightily tend to awaken your con&s;ciences, and promote in you a becoming &s;ollicitude about your highe&s;t intere&s;t. Think of God, your relation to him, your depen|dance on him, and the inviolable obligations you are under to love, honor and &s;erve him. Think on Chri&s;t, what he has done, and &s;uffe|red, and is now doing at God's right hand in heaven for your &s;alvation; what he ex|pects from you in return for all this good|ne&s;s, and what you may expect from him, if you treat it with ingratitude and ba&s;e neg|lect. Think on the coming of the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t a &s;econd time, his coming in the glory of his father, and in his own glory, with the holy angels, to judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, when you &s;hall &s;tand before his tribunal, and, if you have not been careful to approve your&s;elves his faithful and obedi|ent &s;ervants, &s;hall receive that &s;entence from his mouth, "depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into the fire prepared for the devil and his angels". Oh amazing object of contemplati|on!
<PB N="42" REF="012350_0022_0F88F06FF7F28280">
What can be more powerfully adapt|ed to move your fear, awaken your concern, and engage your earne&s;t endeavours, that you may be found of your Judge, in that day, among tho&s;e, to whom he will &s;ay, "come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founda|tion of the world". Can you make pre&s;ent to your view, in &s;erious contemplation, this awful day of the Son of God, and not be concerned that you may then hold up your heads with joy? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that you have faith, &s;o much as a common faith, in this mo&s;t &s;erious and important truth, unle&s;s, when you employ your thoughts on it, your indifferency to religion, your care|le&s;sne&s;s in reference to the duties of it, re|ceive &s;ome &s;olemn check, unle&s;s they no longer operate as your habitual governing temper? If you are, any of you, to &s;uch a degree thoughtle&s;s, and unconcerned, as that you will not reflect on the&s;e intere&s;ting ob|jects of revelation, or are able to think of them with &s;o little attention as not to be moved by them, you are in an unhappy condition. The "god of this world" has blinded your eyes, and you will remain in this &s;piritually hazardous &s;tate, until you are

brought to con&s;ider, and &s;o to con&s;ider as to be hereby thoroughly rou&s;ed. And when|ever this &s;hall come to be your ca&s;e, you will attend the duties of piety, and you will do it from the heart, and not in hypocri&s;y; in real good earne&s;t, and not as a matter of form: And by thus attending on the in|&s;tituted means of grace, you may hope, un|der the concurring influence of the Spirit of God, to be trained up to a "meetne&s;s for the inheritance of the &s;anctified by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t".</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;ort of per&s;ons to be &s;poken to are tho&s;e, who, in&s;tead of indulging to vice, are blamele&s;s in their lives. Their turn of mind is &s;erious and con&s;iderate. They make it their practice to perform the other duties of religion, though not that of re|membring Chri&s;t at his table. It is their care to "pray to their father, who &s;eeth in &s;ecret"; the "morning and evening &s;acri|fice" is daily going up as "incen&s;e" from their hou&s;es; they come to the "&s;anctuary" at the &s;tated times for wor&s;hip, and join with God's people in the public offices of reli|gion, the celebration of the &s;acrament only excepted. Nor is this a meer cu&s;tomary bu|&s;ine&s;s, a matter of form only. They e&s;teem

it their duty, are con&s;ciencious in the doing it, and it would occa&s;ion unea&s;y reflections on them&s;elves, &s;hould they needle&s;sly neg|lect it. Some there are, it may be hoped a good number, of whom this is the ju&s;t character. To &s;uch I would &s;ay,</P>
<P>IT is to your commendation, that you at|tend the&s;e duties of piety. But what good ac|count can you give of your leaving the other undone? Has Chri&s;t, the law-giver, King, and Judge of his Church, di&s;tingui&s;hed between the &s;acramental in&s;titution, and the other du|ties of religion, excu&s;ing your ob&s;ervance of the former, if you practically regard the lat|ter? Has he not rather peremptorily required your obedience to them all? Is it not as truly his will, explicitly and &s;olemnly publi&s;hed, that you &s;hould celebrate the memorial of his dy|ing love, as that you &s;hould pray to God, or take heed to the word of doctrine or exhor+tation? And if it is proper you &s;hould obey him in the&s;e in&s;tances, why not in the other? Is not his authority the &s;ame in all the&s;e re|quirements? And will you do ju&s;t honor to it, if, while you are obedient in &s;ome in&s;tances, you are di&s;obedient in another? Your attend|ing the other exerci&s;es of piety will not be ac|counted another day a good rea&s;on for the
<PB N="45" REF="012350_0023_0F88F070C0C520D8">
neglect of this. It will rather be e&s;teemed an evidence of deficiency in your regard to the government of him who is your profe&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter and Lord. It is not enough my bre|thren, that you give your attendance on prayer, and the word preached. You are as much obliged to "break bread" at the Lord's-Sup|per. You may no more omit the one than the other. They are equally your duty: or, &s;hould there be any difference, your obligati|ons to pay a becoming re&s;pect to the &s;acra|mental in&s;titution are the &s;tronge&s;t, and &s;hould make you more e&s;pecially careful not to treat it with neglect. "This do in remembrance of me," is the dying command of your Savior, as well as Lord; and it is a command that enjoins your remembrance of the greate&s;t love of the be&s;t friend. You are bound therefore in gratitude as well as duty to yield a ready chearful obedience to it. It is &s;trange that any, who have upon their minds a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of religion, and are hereupon careful in other re&s;pects to do the duties of it, &s;hould yet live month after month, and year after year, in the omi&s;&s;ion of this. It is more &s;trange &s;till, that they &s;hould be unea&s;y in their minds, &s;hould they neglect tho&s;e duties, while yet they can go on in the neglect of this, and meet with little

or no di&s;turbance from the re&s;entments of con|&s;cience. How far this con&s;tant omi&s;&s;ion of du|ty, in &s;o important an article, may con&s;i&s;t with the truth of grace, belongs only to Chri&s;t to determine. Unhappy mi&s;takes, &s;cruples, and fears, relative to the Lord's-Supper, (which may come under con&s;ideration in their proper place) will doubtle&s;s extenuate their fault: But when our Lord has &s;o clearly and fully made known his will upon this head, it is difficult to conceive of any thing that will be &s;ufficient to di&s;charge us from the guilt of ingratitude to our Saviour, and the want of a due regard to his authority, as our rightful &s;overeign, while we make it our practice to turn away from his table.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cla&s;s of per&s;ons &s;till may be applied to; and they are tho&s;e who pretend that the &s;upper of the Lord is a temporary appointment, de&s;igned for the apo&s;tolic days only, confined to them, and cea&s;ing with them as to its u&s;e and obligation.</P>
<P>To &s;uch it mu&s;t be &s;aid, their notion of this matter is glaringly a mi&s;taken one. And it may with all freedom be thus &s;poken of, as the apo&s;tle Paul has expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ured us, and upon previous in&s;truction immediately from Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, that the "Lord's
<PB N="47" REF="012350_0024_0F88F07170868410">
death" is to to be "&s;hewed forth until he comes", 1 Cor. 11.26. What is the apo&s;tle's meaning in the phra&s;e he here u&s;es, "until he comes"? Surely he cannot intend the coming of Chri&s;t by his Spirit; for, in this &s;en&s;e, he had already come, and remarkably too on the day of pentico&s;t, when the Spirit was poured out upon the apo&s;tles in miracu|lous gifts and powers. Neither could he mean the coming of Chri&s;t to de&s;troy Jeru&s;a|lem. This event, however awful in its ef|fects upon the jewi&s;h nation, had no immedi|ate reference to the gentile church at Corinth. There would be no pertinency in the apo&s;tle's arguing with this church, in relation to their ob&s;ervance of the Lord's Supper, upon &s;uch an interpretation of his words, And there is no other "coming of Chri&s;t", &s;poken of in &s;cripture, but his "coming" at the end of the world, "in the glory of his father, with his holy angels" when a period will be put to the admini&s;tration of God's kingdom in its pre&s;ent form. So that, if we may depend upon the apo&s;tle Paul, the &s;acramental &s;upper was not a temporary in&s;titution, but a perpetual one; not de&s;igned for the primitive chri&s;tians in the fir&s;t age only, but for all chri&s;tians in all ages to the end of the world. For the death of
<PB N="48" REF="012350_0025_0F88F07229C82EA8">
Chri&s;t is to be "&s;hewed forth until he come", and he will not come until the "my&s;tery of God is fini&s;hed", and "time &s;hall be no more".</P>
<P>BESIDES, the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which treat of this ordinance injoin the ob&s;ervation of it, and point out the manner in which it &s;hould be done, were wrote, in the divine in|tention, for the u&s;e and benefit of chri&s;tians throughout all ages, and not for their's only to whom they were immediately directed. There is no chri&s;tian, in any part, or age of the world, but is as truly concerned, as the chri&s;tians at Corinth, in that apo&s;tolic advice, 1 Cor. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.25, "let a man examine him&s;elf, and &s;o let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup".</P>
<P>THE end al&s;o propo&s;ed by our Savior, in the appointment of this &s;acred rite, is a clear and full proof that it is of perpetual continu|ance, and obligatory upon chri&s;tians in all ages until the end of time. Whatever other ends might be in the view of our Savior, this was certainly one, that the remembrance of his death, by a figurative repre&s;entation of it, publicly recogni&s;ed, might not be forgot, but kept &s;trong and vigorous in the minds of chri&s;tians. And if it was at all needful, in this way, to keep alive the memory of Chri&s;t's
<PB N="49" REF="012350_0025_0F88F07229C82EA8">
death, it was &s;urely as needful in after ages, as in the fir&s;t days of chri&s;tianity. There was indeed le&s;s occa&s;ion for this appointment at fir&s;t, becau&s;e le&s;s danger of a forgetfulne&s;s of Chri&s;t's death. In &s;ucceeding ages, there would be increa&s;ed danger le&s;t he &s;hould be forgot. And that the remembrance of him might be pre&s;erved, continued, and upheld, he in&s;tituted this memorial. So that it was more e&s;pecially de&s;igned for after ages, who, by this emblematical repre&s;entation of him as crucified and &s;lain, might have the reality of this fact, the great foundation of the chri&s;tian &s;cheme, lively in their minds. The longer it is &s;ince Chri&s;t's body was broken, and his blood &s;hed, the more need there is of this memorial of it; and there will be need of it, and continually increa&s;ing need, until time &s;hall be no more. His death therefore mu&s;t be "&s;hewed forth," in the way of di|vine appointment, "until he comes." The obligation to this, in &s;tead of being le&s;&s;en|ed, grows &s;tronger, in proportion to the di&s;|tance from the time of his death, as a &s;a|crifice for &s;in.</P>
<P>IT may be added to what has been &s;aid, that the ordinance of the &s;upper is as &s;uitably and powerfully adapted, in its nature, to be
<PB N="50" REF="012350_0026_0F88F072F3198330">
beneficial to chri&s;tians in all ages, as in the fir&s;t days of the go&s;pel. It offers the &s;ame occa|&s;ion, by figurative, yet expre&s;&s;ive &s;igns, for con|templation on the mo&s;t affecting and intere&s;t|ing objects. It has the &s;ame virtue it ever had, and will retain it, in all future time, to awak|en the attention, to excite affection, to melt the heart, and, in a word, to beget and confirm every real principle of goodne&s;s in the &s;oul. It has all along been productive of the&s;e happy effects, it &s;till produces them, and is equally fitted to an|&s;wer &s;o valuable an end in time yet to come. Why then &s;hould the u&s;e of this ordinance be di&s;continued? Why &s;hould it be thought a temporary one? There is the &s;ame rea|&s;on for its being a perpetual appointment, as for its being an appointment at all. It is equally fitted for the u&s;e of chri&s;tians at all times, and may be, unle&s;s from their own faultine&s;s, of like benefit to them. It would therefore be a di&s;honour to Chri&s;t, by putting an undue limitation on his good|ne&s;s to his church, to &s;uppo&s;e, that he &s;hould de&s;ign &s;o u&s;eful, &s;o beneficial an in&s;ti|tution for his di&s;ciples only in the fir&s;t age, when they all, in all ages, might reap the &s;ame &s;piritual profit therefrom.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t ground of fear I would menti|on is, the apprehen&s;ion many have of &s;ome peculiar kind of &s;anctity in this ordinance. They imagine it to be holy in a &s;en&s;e different from that, in which the other in&s;titutions of chri&s;tianity are holy; and are therefore &s;cru|pulous, as to their attendance on it; while yet they can, without difficulty, attend the other appointments of go&s;pel wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>In order to remove away this ground of fear, I would not &s;ay a word to le&s;&s;en, in the minds of any, a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of that holy reverence with which they &s;hould always approach to the table of the Lord; but it may, at the &s;ame time, be proper to put per&s;ons upon due care to guard them&s;elves again&s;t &s;uper&s;titious notions, re&s;pecting the holine&s;s of the bread and wine, of which they eat and drink at the &s;acramental &s;upper. The&s;e, it may be, are the &s;ource, at bottom, of the &s;crupulous fear I am now con&s;idering. It takes ri&s;e,
<PB N="57" REF="012350_0029_0F88F0766030E7E0">
not from ju&s;t &s;entiments of the nature, de|&s;ign, or tendency of the Lord's-Supper; but from a mind tinctured with &s;uper&s;titious awe and veneration. This is certainly the truth, if we imagine, that holine&s;s, in any de|gree, is tran&s;mitted into the bread and wine by their con&s;ecration to the &s;acramental u&s;e. Many, I have rea&s;on to think, entertain this thought of the matter. But it is intirely a fal&s;e notion. The bread and wine are no other|wi&s;e holy, after their con&s;ecration, than as they are &s;eparated to an holy u&s;e, and in this way become capable of being improved to promote holine&s;s in us. The ordinance of the &s;upper is not therefore holy in a &s;en&s;e any way different from that, in which the other in&s;titutions of religion are holy. They are all holy, as intended, and adapted, to make men holy, and ought practically to be regard|ed without di&s;tinction, or di&s;crimination. Surely we cannot, upon ju&s;t and &s;olid grounds, &s;cruple the u&s;e of the &s;acramental in&s;titution, meerly becau&s;e it is an holy one, while we free|ly u&s;e the other in&s;titutions of religion, all which are holy al&s;o, and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e preci&s;ely too, in which the &s;upper of the Lord is holy. Yea, if the "breaking and eat|ing of bread" at the &s;acramental-table, &s;hould
<PB N="58" REF="012350_0030_0F88F076A5425098">
be e&s;teemed, even, more holy than any other acts of in&s;tituted religion, it would be &s;o far from being a good rea&s;on why we &s;hould not do this duty, that it ought rather more pow|erfully to con&s;train us to it. For why &s;hould the Lord's-Supper be e&s;teemed more holy, than the other appointments of chri&s;tian wor|&s;hip? It can ju&s;tly be &s;o in no &s;en&s;e but this, its being better fitted to promote holine&s;s in us. And &s;hall any, who profe&s;s a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of God, and the obligations of religion, &s;cruple the u&s;e of the &s;acramental in&s;titution for this rea&s;on. They &s;hould rather look up|on them&s;elves &s;o much the more bound to a faithful, con&s;tant, con&s;ciencious ob&s;ervance of it: Yea, &s;o far as they have it in their view to become holy, or to be made more &s;o, by their attendance on the in&s;titutions of the go&s;|pel, they &s;hould be particular in their care not to neglect this, as it is the mo&s;t powerfully &s;uited to promote this good end.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ubjoin here a remark not unworthy of notice. It is this. Chri&s;tians, for many ages, by means of the popi&s;h doctrine of tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation, entertained &s;uper&s;titious, not to &s;ay idolotrous, notions of the &s;acramental bread and wine; &s;uppo&s;ing that they were converted into the real body and blood of
<PB N="59" REF="012350_0030_0F88F076A5425098">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And though the doctrine, from whence the&s;e fal&s;e notions took ri&s;e, has, &s;ince the reformation, been di&s;carded by tho&s;e who are called prote&s;tants; yet may it be feared, whether &s;ome tincture of the old leaven does not &s;till remain in the minds of too many. Thus much, at lea&s;t, may naturally and rea|&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that chri&s;tians, upon &s;e|perating from the church of Rome, retained &s;o much of their former &s;uper&s;tition, as to place too great a difference between the &s;a|cramental &s;upper, and other religious duties. For this rea&s;on they ab&s;tained from an at|tendance at the Lord's table, while they ob|&s;erved the other in&s;titutions of go&s;pel-wor|&s;hip; and, by this means, there might be propagated, in the minds of many, from that day to this, &s;uch a notion of the peculiar holine&s;s of this ordinance, as that they are hard|ly brought to pay a practical regard to it. Whether this is a ju&s;t account of the matter, or not, it is certain, however it comes about, that many &s;erious good people entertain mi&s;|taken apprehen&s;ions of the holine&s;s of this ordinance; otherwi&s;e they would not be indu|ced, from &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, to ab&s;tain from the u&s;e of it. It can, with propriety and truth, be called an holy ordinance, only as it was
<PB N="60" REF="012350_0031_0F88F07A0CF05CD8">
appointed to an holy purpo&s;e and u&s;e, and as it is a proper and powerful means to make the obervers of it holy, according to man's mea|&s;ure, as God is holy. And &s;urely, as has been &s;aid, this is a good rea&s;on why we &s;hould join in celebrating the Lord's-Supper; but a very bad one why we &s;hould neglect to do &s;o. Surely, the rea&s;oning cannot be ju&s;t, the &s;upper of the Lord is holy, as being a di|vine appointment happily calculated to make men holy; I ought not therefore to be a par|taker at it, I may not approach to it. How glaringly ab&s;urd is &s;uch arguing as this! Where|as, the arguing, on the contrary, is &s;trictly right, and &s;trongly conclu&s;ive, the &s;acrament|al-&s;upper was in&s;tituted with a view to make men holy, and is powerfully fitted to &s;uch a purpo&s;e, it is therefore my wi&s;dom, my intere&s;t, my duty, to be a partaker at it; and the more holy it is, on account of its tendency and &s;uita|blene&s;s to make men holy, the more wi&s;e I &s;hall approve my &s;elf, the more I &s;hall con&s;ult my true&s;t intere&s;t, the more will my conduct agree with what is right, proper and fit, while I am in&s;tant, &s;teady and diligent in paying a religious regard, in my practice, to this &s;acred in&s;titution of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>SO that, upon the whole, the fear any &s;eri|ous,
<PB N="61" REF="012350_0031_0F88F07A0CF05CD8">
thoughtful, chri&s;tians may have on their minds, relative to their participation of the Lord's-Supper, as taking ri&s;e from the holi|ne&s;s of this rite of go&s;pel wor&s;hip, has really no ju&s;t foundation. You &s;hould rather fear, my brethren, le&s;t you &s;hould di&s;honour Chri&s;t by neglecting a divinely appointed mean, and the mo&s;t wi&s;ely and powerfully adapted one, in order to your being holy, while you neglect to give your pre&s;ence at the &s;acramental table. You cannot indeed expect to be holy, to be &s;ure not eminent|ly &s;o, while you difu&s;e this &s;pecial and pow|erful means in order to it.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing that keeps &s;ome from the go&s;pel-&s;upper is, a fear le&s;t they &s;hould not live as may be rea&s;onably expected of tho&s;e, who "eat and drink in Chri&s;t's pre|&s;ence"; they think, and with great truth and ju&s;tice, that all, who come to the table of the Lord, &s;hould adorn their character, as the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, by a well-ordered con|ver&s;ation; cau&s;ing their "light to &s;hine be|fore others, that, &s;eeing their good works, they may glorify their father in heaven". But they fear, le&s;t they &s;hould not "walk worthy of the Lord". Others, they ob&s;erve, are too frequently faulty, in this regard, to
<PB N="62" REF="012350_0032_0F88F07AF1B63DF8">
the reproach of Chri&s;t, and &s;candal of his ho|ly religion; and, fearing le&s;t they &s;hould be thus faulty, they are re&s;trained from coming to the &s;upper of their Lord; imagining they had better be non-attendants at it, than run the hazard of this guilt.</P>
<P>TO &s;uch I would &s;ay, your fear is ju&s;t, but does not operate in a right manner. You ought to be "jealous over your&s;elves with a godly jealou&s;y"; encouraging a fear, le&s;t you &s;hould act an unworthy part, and di&s;honor your Savior, by a walk in the world unbe|coming the go&s;pel, and the highe&s;t profe&s;&s;i|on of its bonds on you. But then, it &s;hould be your care to govern the influence of this fear, &s;o as that, in&s;tead of being an hindrance to you in duty, it may rather invigorate your endeavours to put it fully in practice. Your fear is, le&s;t you &s;hould not honor your pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and it is a fear that well becomes all the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity. But what ought, in true rea&s;on, to be its operation? Surely, not to re&s;train you from making a profe&s;&s;ion. This would be a counter action to its proper de&s;ign, and genuine tendency. It &s;hould rather put you upon greater watch|fulne&s;s, and circum&s;pection. It &s;hould quick|en your zeal, and make you more earne&s;t and
<PB N="63" REF="012350_0032_0F88F07AF1B63DF8">
re&s;olute in your endeavours, under the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to behave in the world with that &s;obriety, purity, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, which be|come tho&s;e who &s;it down as gue&s;ts at the table of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, the holy apo&s;tles were a|fraid le&s;t tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed faith in Chri&s;t, and were admitted to break that bread, which is the in&s;tituted memorial of his broken body, &s;hould be unmindful of the bonds of God that were upon them, and live in a man|ner unworthy of their character as the di&s;ci|ples of Chri&s;t. But how did their fear ope|rate? Not by advi&s;ing men to forbear pro|fe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t, or eating and drinking with him at his table. Not a word of this tendency is to be met with, any where in the new-te&s;ta|ment. But, in con&s;equence of this fear, their exhortations were, to "hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of their faith"; to "take heed, watch and pray"; to be diligent and laborious, that their walk in the world might be "worthy of that God who had called them into his kingdom". And this &s;hould be the influence of the fear I am now &s;peaking of; and this will be its influence, if duly regulated. It will not re&s;train any from remembering the dying love of their Lord, in the way of his appoint|ment,
<PB N="64" REF="012350_0033_0F88F07B4E749B78">
but rather fir&s;t urge them to it, and then make them earne&s;t and faithful in their endeavours to behave, in all re&s;pects, as tho&s;e ought to do, who are admitted to &s;o near communion with their Savior and Lord.</P>
<P>I SHALL not think it either impertinent, or un&s;ea&s;onable, if I add a word here to tho&s;e communicants, who, by their unguarded, mi&s;|becoming conduct, are the occa&s;ion of that fear in the minds of many, which re&s;trains them from joining with their chri&s;tian brethren in partaking of the &s;ymbols of Chri&s;t's body and blood. It is too glaring a truth to be di&s;|owned, that, among the gue&s;ts at the &s;acra|mental &s;upper, there are too many who live as though they were in&s;en&s;ible of the bonds they are under to "order their conver&s;ation in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, not by fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God" In&s;tead of being bright examples of tho&s;e virtues that are ornamental to chri&s;tians, and honorary to the religion they profe&s;s, they are too much con|formed to this evil world, and appear too like the men of it. The plain truth is, the unhallow|ed lives of tho&s;e, who &s;it down at the Lord's table, has been a &s;tumbling-block to many &s;erious, con&s;iderate, well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons. Far from exciting them to glorify God by the lu&s;tre
<PB N="65" REF="012350_0033_0F88F07B4E749B78">
of the&s;e graces, they have rather, by their un|chri&s;tian behavior of them&s;elves, made them afraid of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t, left they al&s;o &s;hould be a reproach both to him, and his holy re|ligion. This, my brethren, is utterly a fault. We who "call Chri&s;t Lord, Lord, and eat and drink in his pre&s;ence", &s;hould above all things make it our care to "walk worthy of him unto all plea&s;ing". We &s;hould keep at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance from every thing vicious and immoral; and not only &s;o, but &s;hould be found in the practice of all the virtues that are amia|ble and prai&s;e-worthy. We &s;hould be grave and mode&s;t in our behaviour, &s;ober and u&s;e|ful in our di&s;cour&s;e, diligent and faithful in our re&s;pective callings, ju&s;t and hone&s;t in our dea|lings. We &s;hould daily live in the exerci&s;e of meekne&s;s, patience, faith, temperance, humi|lity. We &s;hould be courteous in our conver&s;e, gentle, kind, peceable and obliging in our car|riage; and, as we have opportunity, &s;hould, according to our ability, "do good to all men, e&s;pecially to the hou&s;hold of faith". In a word, "what&s;oever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what|&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any prai&s;e,
<PB N="66" REF="012350_0034_0F88F07BE62D02A0">
we &s;hould think on the&s;e things", &s;o think on them as to exhibit in our lives a con&s;picuous example of them: So &s;hall we honour our|&s;elves, and reflect glory on our Saviour and ma&s;ter Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and, in&s;tead of deterring others from the table of the Lord, we &s;hall, in the mo&s;t con&s;training manner, invite and urge them to be pre&s;ent as gue&s;ts at it.&mdash;But to leave this digre&s;&s;ion, if any &s;hould plea&s;e &s;o to call it.</P>
<P>ANOTHER difficulty &s;till in the way of &s;ome is a fear, le&s;t, if they &s;hould be overcome to commit &s;in after they have ate and drank at the &s;acramental &s;upper, they &s;hould never obtain forgivene&s;s. This may not be a difficulty that has perplexed the minds of many; but &s;ome, I have rea&s;on to think, are kept from the Lord's-Supper through fear, taking ri&s;e from this view of the matter.</P>
<P>BUT it is a fear altogether imaginary. No|thing in all the Bible gives the lea&s;t counte|nance to it. Far from this, we are a&s;&s;ured, in that &s;acred book, "that if any man &s;hould &s;in", be it before, or after, his breaking and eating bread at the &s;acramental table, "we have an advocate with the father, Je&s;us the righteous, who has been the propitiation for our &s;ins". And this Je&s;us, who died a &s;acrifice for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, has him&s;elf mo&s;t prerempto|rily
<PB N="67" REF="012350_0034_0F88F07BE62D02A0">
declared, in terms too plain and expre&s;s to be ea&s;ily mi&s;under&s;tood, that but one &s;in, the &s;in of bla&s;pheming the holy Gho&s;t, is excepted out of the go&s;pel-grant of pardoning mercy. So that whatever our &s;ins may have been, and when&s;oever committed, whether before or af|ter a profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and eating and drink|ing in his pre&s;ence, they come within the reach of offered, and promi&s;ed forgivene&s;s, and &s;hall certainly, upon our repentance, be pardoned for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, and on account of that atonement he has made for the &s;ins of men.</P>
<P>IT is true, &s;ins that are committed after the highe&s;t profe&s;&s;ion of love to Chri&s;t, and &s;ub|jection to his authority, are aggravated in their guilt; but whatever aggravating circum|&s;tances attend them, they are not &s;uch as will ob&s;truct the be&s;towment of God's mercy in the remi&s;&s;ion of them, in regard of tho&s;e, who in the exerci&s;e of true repentance, repair to him for this ble&s;&s;ing. Tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle Paul contain enough in them forever to &s;atisfy us of this, "where &s;in has abound|ed, grace does much more abound"; though we &s;hould take care we do not abu&s;e this grace, by encouraging our&s;elves to &s;in, that God's grace in the pardon of it may abound
<PB N="68" REF="012350_0035_0F88F07CA6382E00">
towards us. This would argue the ba&s;e&s;t in|gratitude. Shall we be evil, becau&s;e God is good? God forbid!</P>
<P>IT is true likewi&s;e, if any, after &s;uch &s;e|rious impre&s;&s;ions as have put them upon an attendance "on the word, breaking of bread, and prayer", relap&s;e into thoughtle&s;sne&s;s and &s;ecurity, in&s;omuch that they can "&s;in wilful|ly", and in an habitual cour&s;e, "the latter end with them is wor&s;e than the beginning"; the danger awfully great, le&s;t they &s;hould "fail of the grace of God" and be "not again re|newed to repentance". But the ca&s;e even of this kind of per&s;ons is not without all hope. It is po&s;&s;ible they may be awakned to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of things, and be brought to that "re|pentance which is unto life, not to be repen|ted of"; though their &s;tate, it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged, is hazardous; as they cannot be renewed by repentance, but with extreme dif|ficulty.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul &s;ometimes &s;uppo&s;es, that profe&s;&s;ors of religion, even tho&s;e among them who have been admitted to the highe&s;t pri|vileges of God's vi&s;ible kingdom, may &s;hame|fully back&s;lide. And what does he &s;ay here|upon? Does he put any upon neglecting go&s;|pel in&s;titutions through fear, le&s;t they &s;hould
<PB N="69" REF="012350_0035_0F88F07CA6382E00">
afterwards relap&s;e into &s;in? Far from this, he advi&s;es them to be &s;teady and per&s;evering in the u&s;e of them; and to take occa&s;ion from fear of a relap&s;e, to be cautious and cir|cum&s;pect, to look well to them&s;elves, to be upon their guard, and to hold out again&s;t all oppo&s;ition in the way of well-doing, that, be|ing faithful to the death, they may obtain the crown of eternal life. And this &s;hould be the influence of our fear, re&s;pecting &s;in af|ter having ate and drank at the table of the Chri&s;t. In&s;tead of keeping us from this duty, it &s;hould keep us upon our guard, and make us the more watchful over our hearts and lives.</P>
<P>ANOTHER difficulty yet in the way of ma|ny to their attendance at the &s;acramental &s;upper is, a fear le&s;t they are not prepared for &s;o &s;a|cred an ordinance.</P>
<P>To this it might be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, the duty of this kind of per&s;ons is &s;o plain, as not to admit of di&s;pute. They &s;hould in|&s;tantly &s;et about the work of preparation, and give them&s;elves no ea&s;e, until it is accom|pli&s;hed; and the rather, becau&s;e, if it is the real truth, that they are e&s;&s;entially wanting in a preparedne&s;s, in the frame of their minds, for an approach to the table of Chri&s;t, they can
<PB N="70" REF="012350_0036_0F88F07D666E3DD8">
have no good hope towards God. They are unmeet for the kingdom of heaven, and &s;hall not be admitted to &s;it down there, at the eternal &s;upper of the lamb. And, &s;urely, this is not a &s;tate to be continued in with peace and quiet of &s;oul.</P>
<P>But, as this difficulty is the mo&s;t common one, and keeps a great many from the &s;acra|mental table, I &s;hall be more particular and di&s;tinct in offering what may be &s;ufficient to remove it away.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay, you fear whether you are pre|pared to eat bread and drink wine with Chri&s;t at his table; and your fear re&s;trains you from attending this in&s;tance of duty.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to a&s;k you, what do you mean by this preparation, you are afraid you are de&s;titute of? This is an important que&s;tion in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and the true an&s;wer to it will make way for the re|moval of all the difficulty that is per|plexing to you.</P>
<P>DO YOU mean, when you &s;ay you are not prepared for the &s;acrament, that your &s;tate in &s;uch, as that, if you attend this duty, it mu&s;t be done with &s;ome mixture of frailty and imp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ction? If this is
<PB N="71" REF="012350_0036_0F88F07D666E3DD8">
what you mean, you are to be plainly told, that you will never be able to attend the memorial of your Saviour's death in a man|ner perfectly freed from all mixture of &s;in. You will, as long as you live, con|tinue frail imperfect creatures; and God has made no provi&s;ion in the Go&s;pel to prevent it. If therefore you imagine, you mu&s;t not come to the &s;acrament, until you can attend there without any mixture of cor|ruption, you mu&s;t never come: And &s;hould others think as you do, neither would they come; the con&s;equence of which would be, that the &s;acramental &s;upper would have no gue&s;ts to attend it; nor indeed ought it to have any. The real truth is, our Lord ap|pointed the memorial of his death for poor, weak, imperfect, and &s;inful creatures, as the be&s;t of men always have been, and always will be to the end of the world. And if &s;uch may not remember the dying love of their Lord, in the way of his &s;pecial appointment, it mu&s;t never be done in in this world, and &s;o never done at all. For good men, in the coming world, will be above the need, or u&s;e, of this, or any other in&s;trumental mean, as being perfect

in their conformity to the image of Chri&s;t, as he is to the image of the invi&s;ible God.</P>
<P>DO you mean, when you &s;ay you are not prepared for the &s;acrament, that you have not as yet attained to a confirmed, well e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tate of goodne&s;s? Surely, this &s;hould be no bar in your way. It ought rather to be a motive powerfully con|&s;training you to give your in&s;tant and con|&s;tant attendance on this in&s;titution of the go&s;pel. For it was appointed by Chri&s;t, the head of his church, as a wi&s;ely and &s;uita|bly adapted, mean, among other things, to confirm the habits of grace, and make them well e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of all vir|tuous, and chri&s;tian good practice; and it is, by the u&s;e of this divinely appointed mean of grace, as well as by the word, that we are to grow, from the &s;tate of babes and children, to that of complete men in Chri&s;t. You will therefore, not on|ly di&s;honour Chri&s;t, but wrong your&s;elves, if, from &s;uch a mi&s;taken notion, you ne|glect your duty.

You would, if you were con&s;tant, and con&s;ciencious in this near approach to God, and intimate communion with Chri&s;t, be formed more and more to the tem|per of heaven, and a meetne&s;s for the im|ployments and injoyments of that ble&s;&s;ed world. Sin would continually grow weak|er and weaker, and grace &s;tronger and &s;tronger. In a word, by thus commemo|rating the love of your Saviour, you would u&s;e a divinely appointed mean, to &s;trength|en your pious re&s;olutions, invigorate your virtuous principles, and animate your up|right endeavours to grow in a likene&s;s to God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and every thing that is &s;piritually good.</P>
<P>DO YOU mean when &s;ay you are not prepared for the &s;acrament, that you are ignorant of its nature, or of the manner in which you &s;hould attend at it; and, not having &s;ufficient knowledge re|lative to this in&s;titution of religion, you fear you &s;hould do ill to come to it.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer here is ea&s;ie and &s;hort. If you are in earne&s;t in &s;peaking of this as a difficulty, and it is the real truth that you are thus ignorant, there is no

need you &s;hould long continue &s;o, and the fault will be your own if you do. You are favored with all advantages, in order to gain a &s;ufficiency of knowledge, with reference to the &s;acrament. You have the bible in your hands, which re|cords its in&s;titution, explains its nature and de&s;ign, and directs as to the man|ner of attending at it. You have like|wi&s;e, within your reach, a variety of va|luable books, purpo&s;ely wrote by the be&s;t of men, for your help in under|&s;tanding the &s;cripture upon this head. You may al&s;o repair, whenever you plea&s;e, to chri&s;tian friends and mini&s;ters, for all needed in&s;truction. And if under the en|joyment of &s;uch advantages as the&s;e, you continue ignorant, the fault will be your own, and it will be inexcu&s;ably great. It will indeed be evident, that this difficulty, with which you excu&s;e your&s;elves from coming to the &s;acrament, is a meer pre|tence. It will &s;urely be &s;o e&s;teemed by your Saviour, who will al&s;o be your Judge in the great day of reckoning.</P>
<P>DO YOU mean, when you &s;ay you fear whether you are prepared for the &s;acra|ment, that your fear is, whether you are

the &s;ubjects of the &s;aving grace of God, and &s;o think you had better &s;tay away from this ordinance, until you are more free from doubt upon this head.</P>
<P>TO SUCH, as it is my de&s;ign more largely to con&s;ider this difficulty by its &s;elf in its proper place, I &s;hall only &s;ay at pre&s;ent, It may be your fear, le&s;t you have not been partakers of the grace of God in truth, is a fal&s;e one. You may, not|with&s;tanding this fear, have "pa&s;&s;ed from death to life," and be known by Chri&s;t to be in the number of tho&s;e who are HIS in the &s;pecial and eminent &s;en&s;e. Many, among the true fearers of God, have lived, and died, under the prevailence of uncomfortable fears, re&s;pecting their &s;pi|ritual &s;tate. It is therefore no &s;ure argu|ment, that you have not been formed to a likene&s;s to God, in his moral glory, that you have no lively perceptions of it, but rather conflict with doubts and fears, le&s;t this &s;hould not be the truth of your ca&s;e. And let me further &s;ay here, the mo&s;t likely way you can take for the re|moval of your doubts and fears, is, to give your attendance in&s;tantly, and to conti|nue it &s;tatedly, at the &s;acramental table.
<PB N="76" REF="012350_0039_0F88F083810978F0">
What matter of wonder is it, you &s;hould be in doubt about the goodne&s;s of your &s;tate, while you habitually neglect your duty in as plain and evident an article, as any in all the bible? God may be di&s;plea&s;ed with this &s;in of yours, and "hide his face" from you And what is al&s;o wor|thy of &s;erious con&s;iderations while you neglect the &s;acrament, you neglect a mean of grace happily and powerfully &s;uited to give you &s;uch views of the love of Chri&s;t, as may excite the exerci&s;e of love to him, in a degree enabling you to &s;ay, "Lord, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee." There are, among &s;e|rious good chri&s;tians, who can tell you, they have come away from the &s;acrament with a refre&s;hing &s;en&s;e of their intere&s;t in the dying love of their Saviour, though they have gone to it in darkne&s;s and per|plexity.</P>
<P>BUT let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that you are not as yet in what the &s;cripture calls a regenerate &s;tate. Is there nothing, at the &s;acramental table, that is fitted to beget in you the life of God, and true holine&s;s? Have there never been in&s;tances of tho&s;e, in whom the work of grace was begun
<PB N="77" REF="012350_0039_0F88F083810978F0">
with power, by means of a crucified Chri&s;t, here exhibited to open view? And why may not you al&s;o be thus effectually wrought upon, under the influence of di|vine grace? There is nothing, my hear|ers, that can operate upon the human mind, in a way of means, to &s;aving pur|po&s;e, but what is held forth plainly, though by figurative &s;igns, at the &s;acramental table. And the truths here preached may as well have their operation while you are here, as at any other time, or in any other place.</P>
<P>I would not, by what I now &s;ay, be under&s;tood to encourage tho&s;e to come to the ordinance of the &s;upper, who are thoughtle&s;s and unconcerned, in&s;en&s;ible of &s;in, and unre&s;olved as to putting them&s;elves under the guidance, in&s;truction, and go|vernment of Chri&s;t. But this is far from being the ca&s;e of tho&s;e I am &s;peaking to. Their fear of coming to the &s;acrament, le&s;t they &s;hould come in an unprepared man|ner, &s;ufficiently di&s;covers their temper of mind; indicating it to be religious, if not gracious. They would not offend God; they had rather omit duty, than do it under the apprehen&s;ion they &s;hould hereby di&s;|plea&s;e

It is their concern, that they might honour and &s;erve him; and that they do not do it in the article un|der con&s;ideration is owing, rather to their reverence of the divine maje&s;ty, that the want of regard to his governing autho|rity.</P>
<P>And are per&s;ons of this character e&s;&s;en|tially defective in their preparation for an attendance at the table of the Lord? It ought not to be &s;uppo&s;ed. It may rather be thought, they will be e&s;teemed by our Saviour welcome gue&s;ts. They had cer|tainly better wait upon Chri&s;t at this ordi|nance, with this preparation, than totally ab&s;ent them&s;elves from it.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay, you are afraid to come to the &s;acrament, le&s;t you &s;hould come being un|prepared for this &s;acred duty. Let me a&s;k you hereupon, have you no fear upon your &s;pirit, as taking ri&s;e from a total neg|lect of this go&s;pel-appointment? Is there no &s;in, or danger, in a continued cour&s;e of practically throwing di&s;regard upon as ex|pre&s;s an in&s;titution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as any in the &s;acred books? There certainly is, my

friends, both &s;in and danger in neglecting to remember the dying love of Chri&s;t in the way of his appointment; and both the &s;in and danger of this neglect, continued in from one period of life to another, are much greater, and ought therefore to be much more feared, than a meer defect in the degree of preparation. Let it be acknowledged, it is a fault to come to the &s;acrament, unle&s;s we are in &s;ome good mea&s;ure prepared in the habitual frame of our minds; but it is a fault likewi&s;e, and a much greater one, totally to ab&s;tain from it. Our wi&s;dom and duty therefore is, neither ab&s;tain from it, nor to come to it, but with a mind &s;o far prepa|red for it, as that it may be our &s;erious and upright de&s;ire and endeavour to honor our Savior, and reap advantage to our own &s;ouls. And let me add here, none are more like|ly to come in this prepared manner, than tho&s;e who fear to come, le&s;t they &s;hould be unprepared. This fear will influence them to a becoming care, that they may eat of this bread and drink of this cup, not in a thought|le&s;s, cu&s;tomary manner, but in a religious frame of mind, as tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the &s;acramental, and common bread and wine, looking upon them as the &s;ym|bols

It would, in this ca&s;e, be better attended than it commonly is, more to the glory of God through Chri&s;t, and more to the edification of communicants in faith, and love, and comfort.</P>
<P>THERE are yet other difficulties to be mentioned. But the&s;e mu&s;t be referred to &s;ome other opportunity. The good Lord ble&s;s what has been &s;aid, that it may be be|neficial to us.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_I HAVE taken occa&s;ion, from the&s;e words, to apply to &s;everal &s;orts of per&s;ons, in reference to their celebration of the &s;acramental-&s;upper. The la&s;t I &s;pake to were tho&s;e, who would gladly remember their Savior and Lord in this way of his appoint|ment, but that they are hindered by various perplexing doubts and fears. Some of the&s;e I have already mentioned, and endeavoured to remove.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="012350_0042_0F88F085ABF23A98">THE next difficulty, which I now proceed to con&s;ider, ari&s;es from a fear &s;ome have, le&s;t they &s;hould not eat and drink at the &s;upper of their Lord in that SPIRITUAL manner, without which they &s;hould only &s;in, if they &s;hould be gue&s;ts at it. They imagine, they mu&s;t be the &s;ubjects of SPIRITUAL life, or they cannot take of the bread, or wine; or eat of the one, or drink of the other, in the exerci&s;e of that faith and love, with|out which they &s;hould rather prophane the ordinance, than to attend on it to the honor of Chri&s;t, or the profit of their own &s;ouls. They had therefore, they conclude, better &s;tay from it, until they are made &s;piritually "alive to God through Chri&s;t".</P>
<P>IT is obvious to &s;ay in reply here, that no one can pray to God, read, or hear his word, or perform any religious duty in a &s;pi|ritual manner, unle&s;s he is the &s;ubject of &s;pi|ritual life. Fear therefore, as taking ri&s;e meerly from an apprehended want of this life, if con&s;i&s;tent and uniform in its operati|on, will re&s;train per&s;ons from every in&s;tance of piety, as well as this of remembring their Saviour at the &s;acrament. They ought in|deed, upon this principle, no more to pray, or hear God's word, or attend on any in&s;ti|tution of religion, than this of the Supper.
<PB N="83" REF="012350_0042_0F88F085ABF23A98">
For, not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;piritual life, they can no more perform the former of the&s;e duties in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e than the latter. And what are we now brought to in real con&s;equence? Religion, in all its bran|ches, mu&s;t be neglected, by all who have not "pa&s;&s;ed from death to life". And does this comport, in any mea&s;ure, with the re|quirements of the go&s;pel? Was it the view of God, in in&s;tituting the means of religion, that that they &s;hould not be u&s;ed, until one of the main ends, propo&s;ed by them is effec|tually an&s;wered without them? Was it his de&s;ign, that per&s;ons &s;hould &s;it idle, and do no|thing, until, by the power of his grace, they are changed into "new-men in Chri&s;t"? The holy Bible, that infallible rule of direc|tion, no where &s;ugge&s;ts any thing to this purpo&s;e. On the contrary, it puts men up|on the u&s;e of means as the way, and the only way, in which they may expect to be made "partakers of the divine nature". The "clean heart", and the "right-&s;pirit", are, upon the go&s;pel plan of mercy, obtainable ble&s;&s;ings. But how are they to be obtained? Says the an&s;wer of God him&s;elf, "I will be inquired of to do this for you". And that is the ad|vice of our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t, not to tho&s;e
<PB N="84" REF="012350_0043_0F88F08665619098">
only who had grace already, but to tho&s;e al|&s;o who had it not, "a&s;k, and ye &s;hall re|ceive; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened to you". And Simon Magus, though at pre&s;ent de&s;titute of a prin|ciple of &s;piritual life, was yet directed by an in&s;pired apo&s;tle "to pray God if perhaps he might be forgiven". Meerly the want of a &s;piritual principle cannot therefore be a good rea&s;on, why we &s;hould not be in the u&s;e of any in&s;tituted mean of religion. If it is, tho&s;e ought not to pray, who are not &s;piritually alive to God. For they can no more &s;piritually perform this duty, than any other; and if duty may not be performed, unle&s;s &s;piritually performed, they may no more pray than "break bread" at the Lord's table. But per&s;ons, not &s;piritually alive, are not only allowed, but expre&s;sly directed, even by God him&s;elf, to pray to him: From whence it unque&s;tionably appears, that meer|ly the want of &s;piritual life is not a valid rea&s;on, why duty, in any in&s;tance whatever, may not be attended.</P>
<P>THERE are, my brethren, other princi|ples, be&s;ides that of &s;piritual life, from which per&s;ons may perform duty. They may do it from a principle of fear, "being per&s;ua|ded
<PB N="85" REF="012350_0043_0F88F08665619098">
thereto by the terrors of the Lord"; they may do it from a principle of hope, expect|ing in this way to obtain the divine favour; they may do it from a principle of obedi|ence, as having their minds impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;erious deep &s;en&s;e of the bonds of God that are upon them; yea, they may do it from a principle of faith that is real, though it &s;hould fall &s;hort of that which is &s;aving: All which are good principles of action, though not the highe&s;t, and be&s;t.</P>
<P>AND, in con&s;equence of the&s;e principles, that are good in them&s;elves, they may per|form duty al&s;o in a manner morally, if not &s;piritually, good; they may do it heartily, in oppo&s;ition to hypocri&s;y; they may do it earne&s;tly, in oppo&s;ition to heedle&s;sne&s;s and formality; they may do it with awakened affections, in oppo&s;ition to dulne&s;s and cold|ne&s;s; yea, they may do it in the exerci&s;e of a real faith in God, and in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, though their faith &s;hould not be that precious faith, which is peculiar to the ju&s;tified through the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>AND as duty in general, and as it re|&s;pects the "breaking of bread" at the Lord's-table in particular, may be performed
<PB N="86" REF="012350_0044_0F88F087DFF06C10">
from &s;uch principles, and in &s;uch a manner, &s;hall any live in the omi&s;&s;ion of it meerly, or only, becau&s;e they cannot perform it from a principle, and in a manner, &s;till higher and more noble? This, &s;urely, is not right. It cannot be ju&s;tified, either up|on the foot of rea&s;on, or revelation.</P>
<P>IT is readily acknowledged, when men, be&s;ides being de&s;titute of a &s;piritual princi|ple, have &s;o little &s;en&s;e of the nature and obligations of religion, as that they can at|tend it's duties in a thoughtle&s;s, carele&s;s, cu&s;tomary manner; or engage in the perfor|mance of them, only that they may be in the fa&s;hion, or with a view to wear a cloak for reputation, or that they might the more ad|vantageou&s;ly carry on their worldly and car|nal de&s;igns: I &s;ay, when, be&s;ides the meer want of &s;piritual life, per&s;ons are in a di&s;po|&s;ition thus to attend duty, they had as well not do it all. Perhaps, it would be le&s;s di&s;|honorary to God, to omit it, than to perform it thus heedle&s;sly and hypocritically. But &s;hall the &s;ame be &s;aid of that performance of it before de&s;cribed? Shall tho&s;e, who, though they are not &s;piritually alive, yet have upon their minds a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of God and religion, and can attend it's duties with earn|e&s;tne&s;s,
<PB N="87" REF="012350_0044_0F88F087DFF06C10">
affection, and faith; &s;hall &s;uch as the&s;e di&s;courage them&s;elves herefrom, or be di&s;couraged by others? It ought not to be. There is certainly a wide difference between thoughtle&s;s, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;ecure &s;inners, and tho&s;e who are earne&s;tly concerned about the great affairs of religion, who are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;eek God with their heart, and to wait upon him in all the ways of his appointment, that they may be &s;avingly enlightned, and quickned by him. The prayers of the former may be abomination to him, much more a partici|pation of the &s;ymbols of Chri&s;t's body and blood; while he may regard the former, ap|proving of their endeavours, in the u&s;e of the means he has appointed, in order to their being &s;piritually ble&s;&s;ed by him. Did our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t ever di&s;courage &s;uch from coming to him? Was he not rather moved with compa&s;&s;ion towards them? Was he not particularly urgent with them to "to &s;eek God that he might be found of them"? And were there none in the apo&s;tles days, not better qualified, who &s;at down at the &s;acramen|tal &s;upper? Tho&s;e holy men of God gladly admitted multitudes of this &s;ort to commu|nion with them in "breaking of bread". And could they now &s;peak from the excel|lent

glory, I doubt not but they would &s;ay, their fears were groundle&s;s; they ought to get the better of them, and not &s;uffer them|&s;elves, any longer, to be detained from &s;o ad|vantageous a mean of religion as that of the &s;acramental &s;upper. And this leads me</P>
<P>TO another difficulty in the way of &s;ome; and this is, an apprehen&s;ion of the Lord's-Supper as intended, in it's appointment, for tho&s;e only who are partakers of the grace of God in the &s;pecial, or &s;aving, &s;en&s;e. The ordinance, &s;ay they, is a privilege appropri|ated to per&s;ons of this character. No other have a right to it; and &s;hould they lay in a claim, it would be in the view of God nothing better than pre&s;umption. And as we are in doubt, whether our faith is that by which "the ju&s;t &s;hall do live", we doubt our having a right to the &s;acrament, and &s;o had better &s;tay from it, until we are well &s;atisfied that we are be|lievers unto life. This is a difficulty that has often layn heavy upon the minds of too ma|ny; either keeping them from the table of the Lord, or making their pre&s;ence there uncomfortable, if not, at times, greatly di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing. To &s;uch I would &s;ay,</P>
<P>IF it is indeed the truth, that the &s;acrament|al &s;upper is de&s;igned for tho&s;e only who are en|dowed
<PB N="89" REF="012350_0045_0F88F0898B5517B0">
with &s;aving grace, none but &s;uch ought to come to it: Nor ought any other to be en|couraged to do &s;o. This is a plain ca&s;e, &s;o plain as not to admit of di&s;pute. And as their right to come, is, upon this &s;uppo|&s;ition, e&s;&s;entially connected with their being the &s;ubjects of true grace, they mu&s;t be well &s;atisfied they have this grace, or they cannot, upon ju&s;t and &s;olid grounds, be &s;atisfied that they have this right. Grace and right are, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;o related to each other, that wherever there is the want of the one, there cannot be the other. And &s;hould any be in doubt, as to the truth of their grace, they mu&s;t, in the &s;ame degree, be in doubt as to the validity of their claim to this ordi|nance. And to &s;peak plainly, and without di&s;gui&s;e, I mu&s;t freely confe&s;s, I cannot &s;ee how any, who connect a right to the Lord's-Supper with the real truth of Grace, can, with a good con&s;cience, come to it, unle&s;s they are clearly &s;atisfied in their minds, that they are partakers of that unfeigned faith, which is proper only to the redeemed unto God by the blood of Chri&s;t. And was there no other rea&s;on to que&s;tion, whether it is a truth, that the &s;acramental &s;upper is appro|priated to tho&s;e only who are believers in
<PB N="90" REF="012350_0046_0F88F08A2A8EFD30">
the &s;aving &s;en&s;e, in&s;omuch that none el&s;e may warrantably come to it, this I &s;hould e&s;teem a very good one. For who then would eat and drink at the Lord's table, but tho&s;e who had &s;ome good degree of a&s;&s;urance, re&s;pect|ing the &s;afety of their &s;piritual &s;tate? And how few, alas, are the&s;e? It is truly a rare thing to meet with chri&s;tians that have got above doubts and fears, relative to the goodne&s;s of their character in the go&s;pel e&s;timation. The table of the Lord mu&s;t con&s;equently, upon the impleaded &s;uppo&s;ition, be &s;urpri&s;ingly thin of gue&s;ts; unle&s;s tho&s;e &s;hould appear at it, who had no right to be there, or, what amounts to the &s;ame thing, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, who did not know that they had this right, or that were any other than bold intruders; for this they could no otherwi&s;e know, than by being beyond doubt as to the goodne&s;s of their &s;tate God-ward. Surely, it was never the intention of our Savior, in appointing, the &s;acramental &s;upper, to limit an attendance at it to tho&s;e few only, who had got above doubt or fear, as to their being chri&s;tians in the &s;aving &s;en&s;e; and yet, this mu&s;t have been his intention, if tho&s;e only may warran|tably give their attendance, who are the &s;ub|jects of true grace; becau&s;e they mu&s;t know
<PB N="91" REF="012350_0046_0F88F08A2A8EFD30">
them&s;elves to be &s;o, or they cannot know they have any divine warrant to eat of this go&s;pel-&s;upper. The plain truth is, this re|&s;triction of a right to the &s;acrament, will at once exclude multitudes from it who are real chri&s;tians, becau&s;e they are weak and doubt|ing ones. None &s;uch, if a right to this or|dinance is connected with the reality of grace, ought to come to it. For, &s;o far as they are in doubt of their being real good chri&s;ti|ans, they mu&s;t doubt of the lawfulne&s;s of their being gue&s;ts at it. And if they doubt of their right to be at the &s;acrament, they will incur the charge of guilt if they come to it. That &s;aying of the apo&s;tle Paul, Rom. 14.23, is as applicable in the ca&s;e of doubting as to a right to the Lord's-Supper, as in the ca&s;e he particularly mentions, "He that doubteth is damned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The word, rendered here <HI>damnation,</HI> means the judg|ment of a man's con&s;cience, fa&s;tening upon him the charge of guilt. And this it willdo, in the ca&s;e the apo&s;tle is upon, if it does its proper office; "becau&s;e, (as he goes on to rea&s;on) he eateth not of faith," that is, he eateth, not being fully per&s;uaded in his mind, that he might lawfully eat. And this is &s;in. For as it follows, in the next words, "what&s;oever is not of faith is &s;in"; that is, whatever a man doth, not being per&s;uaded, &s;o as to be beyond doubt, that he might lawfully do it, he &s;ins in what he does. <HI>Faith</HI> &s;tands here in oppo&s;ition to <HI>doubting,</HI> and therefore means &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion of mind as leaves no room for he&s;itation, as to the lawfulne&s;s of an action. The greek word tran&s;lated here <HI>doubteth,</HI> is, as Mr. Look ob&s;erves, in Rom. 4.20, tran&s;lated <HI>&s;laggered</HI>; and is there oppo&s;ed to <HI>&s;trong in faith</HI>; or to <HI>fully per&s;uad|ed,</HI> as it follows in the next ver&s;e: And this ex|hibits the true meaning of the apo&s;tle, in the text we are upon. His words, it is true, were &s;poken with reference to eating, or not eating, meat that had been offered to idols. If a man <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, whether he might eat of &s;uch meat, he would be now condemned, in con&s;cience, if he did eat; becau&s;e he did that which he was not fully per&s;uaded in his own mind he might do. But his rea&s;oning will hold equally &s;trong in the ca&s;e before us. If it is a man's profe&s;&s;ed principle, that he ought not to be a partaker of the &s;acramental &s;upper, unle&s;s he is the &s;ub|ject of that faith which is connected with everla&s;t|ing life, he will &s;tand condemned by his con&s;ci|ence, if it judges rightly, as chargeable with guilt, if he partakes while <HI>doubting,</HI> whether he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this faith. If he is not &s;o fully per&s;uaded that he is, as to have got beyond doubt "he &s;ins, becau&s;e he does not this in faith"; that is, with a per&s;ua&s;ion of mind, excluding all doubt, that he acts in this mat|ter, as divinely warranted hereto. Whenever a man doubts of the lawfulne&s;s of an action, it is not po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould do that action, believing that he may law|fully do it; that is, in the exerci&s;e of a faith that is oppo&s;ite to, and excludes doubting, which means the &s;ame thing with a clear, full, and &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of mind; and unle&s;s he has this faith, or full per&s;ua|tion of &s;oul, he "&s;ins", if we may believe the apo&s;tle Paul. Upon the principle therefore, that &s;aving grace is a qualification, without which none have a right to partake of the Lord's-Supper, none ought to do &s;o, until they are freed from all doubt as to their be+ing thus qualified. Simple <HI>hope</HI> will not, in this ca&s;e, be &s;ufficient; no, nor a <HI>prevailing hope.</HI> A man mu&s;t be &s;o fully per&s;uaded, as to have no doubt hanging about his mind. And &s;hould he have been a partaker of the ordinance of the &s;upper an hundred times, if he found him&s;elf to be in a doubting &s;tate, with re|&s;pect to the real truth of his character as one that was &s;avingly converted, it would be his duty to ob&s;erve this in&s;titution no more, until his doubt was removed: otherwi&s;e he would &s;in; for who&s;oever eats and drinks at the &s;acramental &s;upper, according to the principle we are con&s;idering, not having a clearly full, and &s;a|tisfactory per&s;ua&s;ion in his own mind, that he is born of God, not only &s;ins, but his con&s;cience will tell him that the &s;ins, if it is faithful to do its office.</P>
<P>In this view of the matter, which is an apo&s;tolic one, tho&s;e who have not as yet been at the table of the Lord, ought not to appear there, neither &s;hould tho&s;e dare to come again who have often been there, if in the &s;tate David was in, when he prayed, as in P&s;al. 51. "make me to hear joy and gladne&s;s&mdash;ca&s;t me not away from thy pre&s;ence, and take not thine holy Spi|rit from me, re&s;tore unto me the joy of thy &s;alvation, and uphold me by thy free &s;pirit; or if in the &s;tate of tho&s;e, I&s;ai. 50.10. who, though "fearers of the Lord, yet walked in darkne&s;s, and &s;aw no light". In a word, if a right to the &s;acramental &s;upper, and that faith by which a man is ju&s;tified, are in&s;eperably connected by the go&s;pel con&s;titution, no one, whe|ther he never has been, or now is a communicant at it, ought to appear a gue&s;t there, unle&s;s he is &s;ure that he is a believer to life, that is, &s;o per&s;uaded of this as to have no doubt about it in his mind. If the&s;e now are all excluded, and exclude them&s;elves they mu&s;t, or be condemned by their own con&s;cien|ces as chargeable with guilt if they do not: I &s;ay if all the&s;e are excluded, how amazingly thin will be the appearance of gue&s;ts at the &s;acramental &s;upper! By far the greater part in all our churches mu&s;t no more come to this ordinance as communicants, until they are &s;o &s;atisfied of the goodne&s;s of their &s;tate, in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, as to be in no doubt about it: And, perhaps, there may be &s;ome churches to whom it ought not to be admini&s;tred, there not being a &s;ufficient number in them that can "eat in faith"; that is, with &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion of their being the &s;ubjects of converting grace, as excludes all doubt from their minds. Perhaps, this may be the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to &s;ome at lea&s;t of their pa&s;tors; who then &s;hall admini&s;ter the ordinance to them? Surely, our Lord could never intend to make an attendance at his table a matter of almo&s;t con&s;tant perplexity to his di&s;ciples!</P></NOTE> if he eat, becau&s;e

<PB N="95" REF="012350_0048_0F88F090C06CA868">
a denial of the foundation on which it is built, namely, that &s;aving grace is a qualifi|cation without which per&s;ons may not come to the table of the Lord. If tho&s;e may warran|tably come, as allowed by their Lord to come, who have not as yet attained to that

faith which is &s;aving, all ground of perplex|ity from this quarter is at once removed away. And that this is the real truth, I &s;hall en|deavour to make evident to you. And that I may do it in the mo&s;t ea&s;ie, and yet mo&s;t &s;atisfying way, I &s;hall turn your view to the practice of the in&s;pired apo&s;tles, in admitting per&s;ons to communion with them in "break|ing of bread"</P>
<P>AND was this &s;uch as will countenance the thought, that nothing le&s;s than a faith that is &s;aving will qualifie for the &s;acrament, or that none who are not thus qualified, ought to come to it? Far from this, their practice ob|viou&s;ly and unavoidably leads us to think ju&s;t the rever&s;e; namely, that the &s;acramental in|&s;titution was de&s;igned for the u&s;e and benefit of profe&s;&s;ing believers in general, whether their faith is of the &s;pecial, or common kind. It is certain, the &s;everal communities of chri&s;|tians, in apo&s;tolic times, were con&s;tituted of two &s;orts of believers; believers unto life, and believers who&s;e faith was not an abiding prin|ciples of good action. And it is as certain that they all, unle&s;s excluded for open &s;can|dal, were partakers at the Lord's table, and this under apo&s;tolic direction; yea, as having &s;ome or other of the apo&s;tles at their head,
<PB N="97" REF="012350_0049_0F88F090EBD23748">
and leading in the admini&s;tration. Nay, it is evident beyond di&s;pute, that it was the practice of the apo&s;tles to admit profe&s;&s;ing believers to the &s;upper of the Lord under circum&s;tances, wherein neither they, nor the per&s;ons them&s;elves, could, upon rational evi|dence, know, whether their faith was any other than that common one which would con&s;i&s;t with their peri&s;hing beyond the grave. The three thou&s;and per&s;ons we read of, in my context, as admitted to "break bread" with the apo&s;tles, were admitted to this go&s;pel privilege, the very day they were con|vinced that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, and pro|fe&s;&s;ed faith in him as &s;uch. And it is the truth of fact, that it was their practice to receive per&s;ons to communion with them, in all the privileges of God's vi&s;ible kingdom, upon a bare profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t, without waiting for evidence from its fruits, that it was the faith by which "the ju&s;t do live". We no where read, in the &s;acred books, of their delaying to bapti&s;e any, or to admit them to fellow&s;hip in the Lord's-Supper, until it was made evident either to them, or the per&s;ons them&s;elves, that they were the &s;ubjects of that faith which is con|nected with &s;alvation. Far from this, they
<PB N="98" REF="012350_0050_0F88F091AE6C4318">
IMMEDIATELY bapti&s;ed, and admitted to the &s;acrament, all that profe&s;&s;ed faith in the go&s;|pel-revelation, and upon this profe&s;&s;ion only. Surely, they would not have been thus ha&s;ty in their admi&s;&s;ions to a participation in go&s;|pel ordinances, if they had thought, that chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors might not, with the allow|ance of their Savior, join together in "eat|ing and breaking bread", until they were the &s;ubjects of that faith which is ju&s;tifying. Had this been their &s;entiment, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, without di&s;honouring their charac|ter, that they would at once, without any delay, have owned all that made a profe&s;&s;ion of faith as di&s;ciples, admitting them to fel|low&s;hip with them&s;elves in all the privileges of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. It might rather, with all propriety, have been expected, that they would have taken time to advi&s;e, cau|tion, and guard their hearers; waiting for credible evidence, in the judgment of ratio|nal charity, that they were believers in the &s;aving &s;en&s;e, before they allowed them to be partakers at the Lord's-Supper. Had they looked upon it as a truth, that this ordinance was intended by our Lord, in his appoint|ment of it, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e only who were believers unto life, it is unacountably
<PB N="99" REF="012350_0050_0F88F091AE6C4318">
&s;trange, that they &s;hould have encouraged, yea, directed &s;uch numbers to the u&s;e of it, upon a bare profe&s;&s;ion only, before there had been opportunity for the tryal of their faith, or the exhibition of rea&s;onable proof that it was of the &s;aving kind. They knew that our Lord had &s;aid to believers in him, "then are ye my di&s;ciples, if ye continue in my word". And again, "not every one that faith unto me, Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my father which is in hea|ven". They knew al&s;o, from what they had &s;een them&s;elves, that, among tho&s;e who had profe&s;&s;ed faith in Chri&s;t, there were &s;ome, yea, a great many, who&s;e faith did not "work by that love", either to God or man, which the go&s;pel makes nece&s;&s;ary to denominate it a faith that is &s;aving. They could not therefore ad|mit per&s;ons to chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip in go&s;pel ordinances, meerly, or only, upon a verbal profe&s;&s;ion of faith, looking upon this pro|fe&s;&s;ion as credible evidence, that they were tru|ly &s;anctified. For it was not in the judgment of the large&s;t rational charity, good evidence in the ca&s;e. In&s;tead of being convinced, up|on ju&s;t and &s;olid grounds, that it was a ju&s;tfy|ing faith, there was rea&s;on rather to fear, at lea&s;t,
<PB N="100" REF="012350_0051_0F88F09274D4C7C0">
in regard of many, that it was no other faith than would leave them &s;hort of heavenly &s;alvation. It ought not therefore to be &s;up|po&s;ed, when the apo&s;tles &s;o &s;uddenly admit|ted per&s;ons to bapti&s;m, and the Lord's-Supper, upon a bare profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t, that they imagined, that this profe&s;&s;ion gave cre|dible proof that they were believers in the &s;aving &s;en&s;e, or that they e&s;teemed them as &s;uch. It is far more rea&s;onable to think, on the contrary, that they under&s;tood, by the faith here profe&s;&s;ed, no more than &s;uch a conviction that "Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t", as to be therefrom di&s;po&s;ed and influenced to a readine&s;s to own him as their Savior and Lord; and, in con&s;equence hereof, to put them&s;elves under his care, guidance and tuition; and to be found in the u&s;e of his appointments, as the be&s;t method they could take to be fur|ther enlightened, improved, and trained up in the way they &s;hould go, in order to their finding eternal life. If go&s;pel in&s;titutions are con&s;idered as a means wi&s;ely and powerfully fitted to cultivate and improve &s;uch a faith as this, and as de&s;igned by God for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who have it, in order to their becoming chri&s;tians, formed to a "meetne&s;s, for the in|heritance of the &s;anctified by faith in Je&s;us
<PB N="101" REF="012350_0051_0F88F09274D4C7C0">
Chri&s;t, the conduct of the apo&s;tles was exactly &s;uch as it was proper and rea&s;o|nable it &s;hould be. It is beyond all doubt with me, that this was their &s;entiment con|cerning the&s;e in&s;titutions; and that this al&s;o was their view in admitting the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors to an attendance on them. Nor, unle&s;s they acted under the influence of this thought, and with this view, is it po&s;&s;ible, as I imagine, to ju&s;tifie either the wi&s;dom of their conduct, or its faithfulne&s;s to God, or the &s;ouls of men: Nor can they be ju&s;tified, upon any other &s;cheme of tho't, who encourage per&s;ons in the u&s;e of go&s;pel in&s;titutions, who are not clearly &s;atisfied, upon proper tryal of their faith by its fruits, that it is of the &s;aving kind.</P>
<P>THE plain truth is, no good rea&s;on can be given, why the in&s;titutions of the vi&s;i|ble kingdom of God &s;hould not be intended for the u&s;e and benefit of all profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;|tians, &s;eriou&s;ly concerned about their &s;ouls, and everla&s;ting &s;alvation; though their faith, at pre&s;ent, &s;hould be no other than that which is the effect of the ordinary illumi|nations and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the divine Spirit. They are as &s;uitably adapted to beget, as to increa&s;e, a faith that is &s;aving. And it is, perhaps, in the &s;erious, diligent, per&s;evering u&s;e of the&s;e
<PB N="102" REF="012350_0052_0F88F0933691BA00">
&s;tituted means of grace, that per&s;ons, ge|nerally &s;peaking, are made holy, really and truly &s;o, as well as improved in this gracious quality of their minds. Men, it is true, mu&s;t have faith in the go&s;pel-revelation, be|fore they can attend its in&s;titutions, unle&s;s they &s;hould do it from a principle of hy|pocri&s;y. Accordingly the apo&s;tles admitted none to chri&s;tian communion, until they profe&s;&s;ed faith in Chri&s;t. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may be worthy of remark here, as tho&s;e, to whom the go&s;pel was preached in the apo&s;tles days, were either <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> they could have ad|mi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible kingdom of Chri&s;t only by bapti&s;m, with a previous profe&s;&s;ion of faith in him as the Son of God, and Savior of the world. But then it ought to be con&s;idered, this profe&s;&s;ion they might make from a real and &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of mind that he was "the Son of God", and his re|ligion that alone by which they could be &s;aved; while, at the &s;ame time, their faith, which was the ground of their admi&s;&s;ion into Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible kingdom, might fall &s;hort of that which would intere&s;t them in eter|nal life. Our Savior him&s;elf has put this beyond di&s;|pute, not only by declaring more than once, in ex|pre&s;s words, that "many who believed on him" were not believers unto life; but by a variety of parables, which he &s;pake on purpo&s;e to convey this &s;entiment, that per&s;ons might be vi&s;ible members of his kingdom, though their faith was not of the &s;aving kind; as you may read at large, in the 13th Chap. of Matthew's go&s;pel. Nay, &s;o far was he from &s;uppo&s;ing, that all that profe&s;&s;ed faith in him, and had thereupon been admitted, as di&s;ciples, into his vi&s;ible kingdom, were the &s;ubjects of that "faith by which the ju&s;t do live", that he not only compares many of them to <HI>tares</HI> growing up with the <HI>wheat</HI>; but &s;olemnly prohibits their being "rooted up", and publi&s;hes it as his plea|&s;ure, that both be &s;uffered to "grow together, until the time of the harve&s;t". One rea&s;on of this, with|out all doubt, was, that they might, by the cultivation of go&s;pel means, and advantages, be changed into <HI>good wheat.</HI> In the natural world this is impo&s;&s;ible; but not &s;o, in the &s;piritual kingdom of Chri&s;t. <HI>Tares</HI> may be, and often have been, converted into <HI>wheat</HI>: And one thing de&s;igned by our Savior in &s;uffering tares to have a being in his church unque&s;tionably was, that this conver&s;ion, under go&s;pel culture, might be effected. In this re&s;pect, there is an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> difference between God's kingdom that is above, and his king|dom here on earth. None but &s;uch as have been partakers of the grace of God in truth &s;hall have ad|mi&s;&s;ion granted to them into the heavenly kingdom. And provi&s;ion has accordingly been made to bring this into event. For one that infalibly knows "what is in man", is the appointed judge, with whom it be|longs to determine, who the per&s;ons are that &s;hall have entrance into heaven. And none but &s;uch as he knows, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;take, have been "&s;ancti|fied through faith in him", &s;hall &s;ee his face there. And had it been, in like manner, the intention of God, that none but the "renewed in the &s;pirit of their minds", &s;hould be admitted into his vi&s;ible church on earth, and partake of its vi&s;ible privileges, he would, without all doubt, have taken &s;ufficient care, &s;o to have guarded the affair of admi&s;&s;ion as to have exclud|ded all others. But this he has not done. There is no divinely con&s;tituted judge, or judges, on earth, either among the clergy or laity, con&s;idered &s;ingly, or as united in a body, who are qualified to make a <HI>certain</HI> judgment, re&s;pecting the real character of any of tho&s;e who may de&s;ire to be admitted to fellow|&s;hip in go&s;pel ordinances; neither are the per&s;ons, who offer them&s;elves, always able to make a ju&s;t judgment of their own character, and never an ab&s;o|lutely certain one. Chri&s;t is the one only judge of the internal &s;tate of men; nor will this be <HI>certainly</HI> known, until the day of the revelation of his righ|teous judgment. It is, therefore, highly rea&s;onable to think, that there is a difference between the terms of admi&s;&s;ion into the church on earth, and the church in heaven. If they were the &s;ame, it would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that no effectual provi&s;ion &s;hould be made to keep tho&s;e out of the church here, who are di&s;qua|lified for an admi&s;&s;ion into the church of God that is above. The plain truth is, it is no where &s;ugge&s;ted, in any part of the old or new-te&s;tament, that all tho&s;e who are members of the vi&s;ible church here, and admitted to partake of its vi&s;ible privileges, are real|ly and certainly &s;aints; or that, as &s;uch, they will hereafter be joined to "the general a&s;&s;embly, and church of the fir&s;t-born, which are written in heaven". The intention of God, therefore, in erecting a vi&s;ible kingdom, here on earth, with a variety of vi&s;ible means, helps, privileges, and advantages, was not meerly, or only, to enlarge and brighten the qualifi|cations of tho&s;e, who are already <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> qualified for heaven; but to form tho&s;e al&s;o to a meetne&s;s for it, who may as yet be de&s;titute of this meetne&s;s: And the in&s;titutions of this kingdom are all of them &s;o contrived, as to be, at once, equally and powerfully adapted, both to begin, and carry on, the work of &s;anctification in the &s;ouls of all that are members of it.</P>
<P>I MAY properly &s;ubjoin here, the divinely ap|pointed way, in which per&s;ons become members of the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that, in order to their being &s;o, they mu&s;t be the &s;ubjects of &s;aving faith, or judged to be &s;o. A profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t, in apo&s;tolic times, was <HI>that,</HI> without which, neither <HI>Jews</HI> nor <HI>Gentiles,</HI> of whom the world then con&s;i&s;ted, could, by bapti&s;m, be admitted members of his vi&s;ible kingdom. But how was it po&s;&s;ible, that even the apo&s;tles, much le&s;s their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in after ages, who could judge by the out|ward appearance only, not having it in their power to in&s;pect the hearts of others, &s;hould be able to de|termine, whether the faith they profe&s;&s;ed was of the &s;aving kind? And it is certain, it was not always of this kind, neither in the fir&s;t times of the go&s;pel, nor in any age &s;ince. Shall we &s;ay then, that tho&s;e were not members in the vi&s;ible kingdom of Chri&s;t, who&s;e faith was &s;hort of that which is &s;aving? This mu&s;t be &s;aid, if &s;aving faith is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification in or|der to vi&s;ible member&s;hip in the church of Chri&s;t. And will it not herefrom unavoidably follow, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to know, who are, and who are not, members of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible kingdom? Yea, whether he has any &s;uch kingdom in the world?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it ought to be remembered, that the children of tho&s;e, who are members of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible church, are, by the con&s;titution of God, from their fir&s;t coming in|to exi&s;tence, members of this kingdom in common with their parents. So it was under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> di&s;pen|&s;ation. And &s;o it is now under the chri&s;tian; if there is any validity in one of the principal arguments, by which we vindicate our practice, in bapti&s;ing the infants of tho&s;e, who are members of Chri&s;t's church. We bapti&s;e them, becau&s;e they are born di&s;ciples, members, in common with their parents, of the &s;ame vi&s;ible kingdom, under the admini&s;tration of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Bapti&s;m is the badge, &s;ign, or token of this privilege, by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the children of tho&s;e parents, who are without the pale of the church. With re&s;pect to <HI>the&s;e,</HI> who are by far the greater part of the vi&s;ible kingdom of God, none will &s;ay, they were, when they fir&s;t commenced members of this kingdom, the &s;ubjects of &s;aving faith. A mem|ber&s;hip in the church of Chri&s;t was their birth-right, an ab&s;olute grant of the favor of God towards them. And members of this church they will be, whether their parents bring them to bapti&s;m, neglect to do &s;o, or are hindered by the invented requirements of man. For bapti&s;m with re&s;pect to infants, is the mark of Chri&s;t publicly owning them as members of his king|dom, not a rite by which they are admitted into it.</P>
<P>IT will, perhaps, be &s;aid here, &s;hould it be allowed, that the infant &s;eed of believers are, in common with their parents, members of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, yet it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, be affirmed, that this gives them no right, when they come to years, to &s;pe|cial go&s;pel ordinances. In order to this, they mu&s;t profe&s;s &s;aving faith in Chri&s;t, and explicitly cove|nant to be his: It is this, and this only, that in&s;tates them in this right. The reply is, if the go&s;pel was to be preached to our native Indians, or to other pa|gan people, or to the Jews in any place whither they have been &s;cattered, they would have no right, any more than tho&s;e the apo&s;tles preached to, in their day, to &s;pecial go&s;pel ordinances, until, by a previous profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t, they had been admit|ted, by bapti&s;m, into that vi&s;ible church of which he is head. But this cannot, with truth, be applied to tho&s;e, who are already members of this church; as is the ca&s;e, with re&s;pect to &s;uch adults as had, in their infancy, the mark of di&s;ciples put upon them by the water of bapti&s;m. How far it may be expedient, as tending to edification, for <HI>the&s;e</HI> previou&s;ly to their coming to &s;pecial ordinances to profe&s;s faith in Chri&s;t, and openly covenant to be his, I di&s;pute not at pre&s;ent. But thus much I will venture to &s;ay, that, their right to &s;pecial ordinances is not at all founded on any &s;uch profe&s;&s;ion or covenant, but on their member&s;hip in the church of Chri&s;t. Being members of this church, as truly &s;o as tho&s;e who communicate at the table of the Lord, they have a divinely e&s;tabli&s;hed right, when they come to years, to all the vi&s;ible means, privile|ges, and advantages of the go&s;pel vi&s;ible kingdom: Nor has any church on earth a power delegated to them, from him who is head over all, to hinder them from the exerci&s;e of this right, unle&s;s their behavior is &s;uch as that, in a way of chri&s;tian di&s;cipline, a &s;top is put to it conformably to the directions of the go&s;pel. The plain truth is, they are either members of the vi&s;ible kingdom of Chri&s;t, or they are not. There is no medium here. If they are members at all, they are as much &s;o as they can be. It is not in the power of man to make them more &s;o then they are already. The owning the covenant, as it is called, that they may have bapti&s;m for their children, according to the manner of the&s;e churches; or their owning the &s;ame covenant, or a like one, that they may be admitted, as we commonly &s;peak, to full com|munion, makes no alteration as to their member&s;hip in the kingdom of the Son of God. They were be|fore as truly, and as much members in this kingdom, as they are now. There are no <HI>half members</HI> in the vi&s;ible kingdom of Chri&s;t. Whoever are members at all, are <HI>whole</HI> members; and, as &s;uch, have a right, at mature years, to a &s;eat at the table of the Lord, un|le&s;s, by their unchri&s;tian conduct, they have forfeited it. The churchs of Chri&s;t, I fear, are generally and greatly wanting in their duty to tho&s;e, who are vi&s;i|ble members of the &s;ame body with them&s;elves, while they take little or no care, that they pay due ho|nor to the &s;pecial in&s;titutions of chri&s;tianity. In|&s;tead of laying ob&s;tacles in their way, preventive of this, they &s;hould remove them &s;o far as it is in their power; giving them all the encouragement, and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance they may need. If they &s;ee their way clear to bring their children to bapti&s;m, and are &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;i|rous of it, they &s;hould be permitted to do it; though religious fears and &s;cruples &s;hould re&s;train them from coming to the table of the Lord; in which ca&s;e, they &s;hould be in&s;tructed in meekne&s;s, with all long-&s;uffer|ring and forbearance. But, if their neglect of this ordinance &s;hould appear to ari&s;e from habitual care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s and inattention, di&s;covering their contempt of it, they &s;hould be reproved and admoni&s;hed; and, if finally ob&s;tinate in their contempt, they &s;hould, in the go&s;pel way, be cut off from their relation to Chri&s;t,&mdash;But I may not carry this note to a greater length: Nor &s;hould I have &s;o enlarged it, had it not been my view to &s;ignify my &s;entiments, with re&s;pect to &s;ome of the di&s;putes of the pre&s;ent day; which appear to me founded on gro&s;s ignorance of the real na-nature of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible kingdom.</P>
<P>Since the penning the above note, and putting it into the printer's hands, I ob&s;erved, upon occa&s;ionally look|ing over the records of the fir&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, of which I am pa&s;tor, the following que&s;tions, with an affirmative an&s;wer to them.</P>
<P>"Whether the relation of immediate children of church members be &s;uch, as giveth the church a church-power over them? And, con&s;equently, whether it is the duty of the church to exerci&s;e that power regularly upon them, that their knowledge and life may be an|&s;werable to the engagements of their relation? And whether it be the church's mind, that &s;olemn notice be given to them &s;ea&s;onably? Voted by the church in the affirmative, on the 29th of the 11th month 1656. In agreement with this declared &s;en&s;e of the church, &s;everal acts of di&s;cipline are recorded; particularly, the two following.</P>
<P>&mdash;"Son of our brother&mdash;of the age of 16 years, born and bapti&s;ed into the fellow&s;hip of the cove|nant, for his choo&s;ing evil company, and frequenting a hou&s;e of ill report, and that at un&s;ea&s;onable times, with bad per&s;ons, was called before the church, and admoni&s;hed, the 3d of the 1sd month 1653".</P>
<P>&mdash;"Being of the age of 21 years, born and bap|ti&s;ed in the fellow&s;hip of this church, for his commit|ting the &s;in of fornication, and his contempt of the church, that he would not come to hear them, was, in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and with the con&s;ent of the church, excommunicated, on the 28th of the 4th month 1657.</P>
<P>I have here in&s;erted the &s;en&s;e of this church, re&s;pect-their duty towards bapti&s;ed per&s;ons, and their practice thereupon, in a way of di&s;cipline; becau&s;e, as I ima|gine, they are truly &s;criptural, and if copied after, with due care and wi&s;dom, would &s;erve the church of God va&s;tly more, than all that has ever been contro|ver&s;ially wrote, about the right of per&s;ons that have been bapti&s;ed to bring their children to bapti&s;m, or to "break bread" them&s;elves at the table of the Lord.</P></NOTE> But, upon do|ing this, they received them into the king|dom

<P>ENOUGH has now been &s;aid to make it
<PB N="106" REF="012350_0054_0F88F095615F3680">
evident, that &s;aving grace is not a qualifica|tion, without which per&s;ons may not come to the &s;upper of the Lord.</P>
<P>Two things are commonly objected again&s;t what has been &s;aid, which it may be pro|per and needful to take &s;ome notice of here.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="012350_0054_0F88F095615F3680">THE fir&s;t is, the ca&s;e of the Ethiopian eunuch, who, upon de&s;iring to be bapti&s;ed, re|ceived that an&s;wer from Phillip, who had been expounding the &s;cripture to him, "if thou believe&s;t with all thine heart, thou maye&s;t." The plea here is, &s;aving faith was,
<PB N="108" REF="012350_0055_0F88F09577BD4980">
in regard of this per&s;on, made nece&s;&s;ary in order to his being admitted to the ordinance of bapti&s;m. And if he might not be bapti&s;ed without this faith, to be &s;ure be might not be a partaker at the Lord's-table.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer is ea&s;ie. It is &s;aid, without &s;ufficient rea&s;on, that "believing with all the
<PB N="109" REF="012350_0055_0F88F09577BD4980">
heart" means the &s;ame thing with &s;aving faith. Many, in the days of Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles, heartily believed; yea, their whole heart was in their faith, in&s;omuch that they received the word with joy, yea, a &s;trong motion in all the pa&s;&s;ions and af|fections
<PB N="110" REF="012350_0056_0F88F096252769E0">
of their heart; while yet, their faith was not as an abiding principle, as appeared afterwards, by their falling away in a time of temptation, or by their being led a&s;ide by the cares of the world. And this might have been the ca&s;e, of this eunuch, for ought any thing that is known to the
<PB N="111" REF="012350_0056_0F88F096252769E0">
contrary: Be&s;ides, the eunuch, in an&s;wer to Phillip, did not &s;ay that he "believed with all his heart." His words import nothing more than &s;ingle naked belief. Said he, "I believe that Je&s;us is the Son of God"; upon which he was &s;traitway bapti&s;ed. But if his an&s;wer had been, "I believe with all my heart, that Je&s;us is the Son of God", it would not have been evident, that he was
<PB N="112" REF="012350_0057_0F88F099E78F0B70">
the &s;ubject of a faith that would have argued his being born of God: To be &s;ure, he could not know that he was, upon ju&s;t and &s;olid grounds, unle&s;s by in&s;piration from a|bove; and without this, he would have been too ha&s;ty, and indeed ra&s;h, if his declaration concering his faith was intended to con|vey this thought.</P>
<P>IT may po&s;&s;ibly be thought by &s;ome, that "believing with all the heart" is too &s;trong a mode of &s;peech to mean any thing &s;hort of a faith that is connected with life. But it is a certain truth, that per&s;ons may be|lieve in Je&s;us as the Son of God, and Savior of the world; really in oppo&s;ition to deceit, and hypocri&s;y; heartily, in oppo&s;ition to the want of affection; and "with all their heart", as &s;ignifying the pa&s;&s;ionate emotion of their whole &s;oul; while yet their faith may have no
<PB N="113" REF="012350_0057_0F88F099E78F0B70">
depth of root, and may leave them &s;hort of that renovation of mind without which they cannot be &s;aved. It may be worth remem|bering here, it is &s;aid 2 Cron. 15.12, that "all Judah entered into a covenant to &s;eek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart, and with all their &s;oul". It follows in the 13th v. "and all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had &s;worn with all their heart: and God was found of them". Surely, no one will &s;ay, that, by "all the heart", in this pa&s;&s;age, we are to under&s;tand a heart that had
<PB N="114" REF="012350_0058_0F88F09AC5366D48">
been renewed by the grace of God. The mo&s;t the phra&s;e can be &s;uppo&s;ed to import is, that they entered into this covenant in real earne&s;t, as having in motion the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions and affections of their heart. So this eunuch believed, before he was bapti&s;ed; and yet, neither he, nor they, might be the &s;ub|jects of that &s;anctifying grace, without which they could not enter into that life which is eternal in heaven.</P>
<P>THE other objection is taken from tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle Paul, which he &s;pake with immediate reference to a participation at the Lord's-Supper, 1 Cor. 11.28. "Let a man examine him&s;elf, and &s;o let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup". Now, a man's having, or not having, that faith which intere&s;ts him in the purcha&s;es of the redeemer's cro&s;s, being an affair of the greate&s;t impor|tance, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that this is the faith about which we are directed to examine our &s;elves, and &s;o go, or forbear to go, to the Lord's-Supper, as we find our&s;elves to be, or not to be, the &s;ubjects of it.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer whereto, I would &s;ay. It is rea|dily acknowledged to be a matter of great im|portance to examine into our faith, that we may know, whether it is a faith that is connect|ed
<PB N="115" REF="012350_0058_0F88F09AC5366D48">
with &s;alvation; and it may be fit and pro|per, as it would an&s;wer &s;ome very good ends, thus to examine our&s;elves, when we are about to go to the table of the Lord; though this is not the examination the apo&s;tle has here in his view. The examination he directs to, does not &s;o much relate to the chri&s;tian's character as &s;avingly converted, as to his knowledge and faith, with reference to the &s;acramental &s;upper. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The famous Henry Stephens, to whom our greek lexicographers are greatly indebted, and from whom they have greatly copied, affixes to <HI>dolimaz&ocirc;,</HI> as ex|pre&s;&s;ive of its meaning, the words, <HI>exploro, probo, experior, examino, ae&s;timo</HI>; and exhibits a number of examples, from the be&s;t greek writers, of the&s;e &s;eve|ral meanings of the word. And in all the&s;e &s;en&s;es, and perhaps in &s;ome other, it is u&s;ed in the new-te&s;tament-books; examples of which might ea&s;ily be pointed out. But, in&s;tead of this, I would rather ob&s;erve, that its <HI>more &s;pecial</HI> &s;en&s;e is always to be determined by its connexion in the di&s;cour&s;e of which it is a part. It may al&s;o be worthy of remark, whether it &s;ignifies, in any place, to <HI>prove, approve, e&s;teem,</HI> or the like, the <HI>ba&s;is</HI> of this meaning is, the true meaning of the engli&s;h word, <HI>examine.</HI> I would further &s;ay, to <HI>examine, explore, fift</HI> a matter by thorough inquiry, is mo&s;t frequently the &s;en&s;e in which <HI>dokimaz&ocirc;</HI> is u&s;ed; though this &s;en&s;e is &s;ignified in our bible-tran&s;lation, by various engli&s;h words of one and the &s;ame import. And this, as I judge, is its <HI>proper,</HI> or <HI>more &s;pecial,</HI> &s;en&s;e in the text we are upon. When the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Dokimaz<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">t&ocirc; de anthr&ocirc;pos eauton</HI>", the tran&s;lation in our bibles, "let a man examine him&s;elf", is, I imagine, as proper and ju&s;t an one as could be given. For, let it be re|membered, in order to rectify the di&s;orders of the church at corinth, in relation to their ob&s;ervance of the &s;acramental &s;upper, he had particularly recited to them the original in&s;titution, as he had received it from Chri&s;t him&s;elf: Upon which he immediately &s;ubjoins, "let a man examine him&s;elf, and &s;o let him eat." To what end could he here &s;et, before the view of the Corinthians, the pure, uncorrupt in|&s;titution of the &s;upper, if it was not, that, by ex|amining their conduct by it, they might be influ|enced to behave better for the future. Surely, the duty here injoined them can be no other, than a trial of their "eating" the Lord's-Supper by the in&s;titution it&s;elf, in order to their comporting with the end propo&s;ed by it. His meaning may, I think, be clearly and fully expre&s;&s;ed in the following pa|raphra&s;e, let a man bring him&s;elf to the te&s;t of the in&s;titution, as I have given it in the words of Chri&s;t him&s;elf; let him examine, explore, try, and fift him|&s;elf by it: In this way, he can be at no lo&s;s to de|termine, that his conduct will be greatly to blame, if he eats and drinks at the &s;acramental &s;upper in that irreverent manner I have de&s;cribed, and am endeavour|ing to reform; but will &s;ee him&s;elf obliged to do this in agreement with the nature, and de&s;ign, of this &s;acred appointment: "And &s;o let him eat"; that is, conforming the manner of his eating to what up|on examination. he finds it ought to be; as what he does in this matter is, in obedience to a &s;acred ap|pointment of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this &s;ame <HI>trying, exploring, examining,</HI> a man's &s;elf, by comparing his thoughts, his views, and his temper of mind, with the nature and de&s;ign of the &s;acramental in&s;titution, as here recorded by the apo&s;tle, will, at all times, and with re&s;pect to all chri&s;tians, in all places, have an happy and powerful tendency, not only to guard them again&s;t all irreverence and indecency in their celebration of the Lord's-Supper; but to excite their care to eat of the bread, and drink of the wine there, &s;o as that they may do this in a manner be|coming &s;o &s;acred a rite of the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</NOTE> The ca&s;e was this, The Corinthi|ans, to whom he was now writing, had been
<PB N="116" REF="012350_0059_0F88F09B669DDD40">
very irregular and di&s;orderly in their cele|bration of the Lord's-Supper, for which the apo&s;tle, in this 11th chapter of his epi&s;tle to them, &s;harply reproves them; and, in order to rectify their di&s;orders, he particularly re|lates
<PB N="117" REF="012350_0059_0F88F09B669DDD40">
to them the in&s;titution of the &s;upper, as he had received the account of it immediate|ly from Chri&s;t him&s;elf, that, knowing its nature and de&s;ign, they might ob&s;erve it in a more worthy manner. In order whereto, his direction follows "let a man examine him|&s;elf, and &s;o let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup". As if he had &s;aid, I have
<PB N="118" REF="012350_0060_0F88F09C2869F280">
laid before you, in plain ea&s;ie words, the nature and de&s;ign of the &s;acramental &s;upper, as in&s;tituted by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Examine your|&s;elves by this rule, and do it &s;eriou&s;ly, care|fully and faithfully. This I advi&s;e you to, as a proper and &s;uitable expedient to prevent your coming to this ordinance in the irreve|rent, indecent manner you have formerly done. In this way, you may come in a more wor|thy and becoming manner, to the honor of Chri&s;t, and your own &s;piritual profit. What the apo&s;tle aims at is, to put them upon duly di&s;tingui&s;hing between this &s;upper of the Lord, and their own, which they ate previous to it; looking upon it, not as a common meal, and partaking of it as &s;uch, but as an in&s;tituted memorial of Chri&s;t's dying love. This they might do, though their faith as yet was no other than that, which is the effect of the or|dinary influence of the divine Spirit. Doubt|le&s;s, a very con&s;iderable number of the&s;e Co|rinthians had no higher a faith than this; and if the apo&s;tle intended, that they &s;hould &s;o examine them&s;elves as not to come to the &s;acrament any more, unle&s;s they could find that they had &s;aving faith, a very great part of this church mu&s;t have ab&s;tained from the u&s;e of this ordinance. But this the apo&s;tle had not
<PB N="119" REF="012350_0060_0F88F09C2869F280">
in view. His only de&s;ign was, to direct to &s;uch an examination, more e&s;pecially in relation to the &s;acramental &s;upper, as might happily in|fluence them to come to it in a more beco|ming manner, and as might rea&s;onably be ex|pected of tho&s;e, who eat and drink of tho&s;e &s;ymbols, which figuratively repre&s;ent the dying love of Chri&s;t towards &s;inners.</P>
<P>BUT the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle in this chap|ter will be more largely illu&s;trated, when I come to con&s;ider the next difficulty that hin|ders many &s;erious chri&s;tians from an approach to the Lord's table. This is an important difficulty, and the occa&s;ion of perplexing fear to a great many. The con&s;ideration of it mu&s;t therefore be left to &s;ome other opportu|nity.</P>
<P>I SHALL only &s;ay further at pre&s;ent, It is not an ea&s;ie matter for chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially chri&s;tians that are weak in faith, or that are but beginners in religion, to determine con|cerning their faith, that it is, not of the com|mon, but &s;aving kind. It would therefore be inconvenient and unfit to put them upon mak|ing this determination, previous to their go|ing to the &s;acrament, and as a qualification in order to it, and without which they might not attend at it. It would unavoidably throw
<PB N="120" REF="012350_0061_0F88F09D089E6008">
the minds of many that are real chri&s;tians, as well as other &s;erious well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, into perplexity and fear, and keep them from coming to this ordinance, though they might otherwi&s;e come to it with profit to them&s;elves, and &s;o as to honor their ma&s;ter Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I cannot &s;uppo&s;e, the apo&s;tle would have given this occa&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing concern, as he mu&s;t have done, in thou&s;ands of in&s;tances, if the examination he directs to, in this text, refers to a determination of our faith as &s;aving, in order to our going to the &s;acrament.</P>
<P>THE good Lord ble&s;s what has been now &s;aid to the removal of tho&s;e fears, which keep any from the table of the Lord; and may there, for the time to come, be &s;een a greater num|ber of welcome gue&s;ts at it!</P>

And again, ver. 29, "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damna|tion to him&s;elf, not di&s;cerning the Lord's body."</P>
<P>THE readie&s;t, and mo&s;t effectual way, as I imagine, to obviate this difficulty, and give ea&s;e to the minds of tho&s;e who may be perplexed with it, will be to be particular and di&s;tinct in a&s;certaining the preci&s;e meaning of the apo&s;tle, in the phra&s;es he u&s;es in the&s;e texts, "eating and drink|ing unworthily"; being "guilty of the body and blood of the Lord"; and "eating and drinking damnation to him&s;elf"; and then in applying what may be offered to

the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who may be under per|plexing fear, from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred writ, in a few remarks, or ob&s;ervations, &s;uited to give them relief and help.</P>
<P>I SHALL, in the fir&s;t place, endeavour, with all plainne&s;s, to open the meaning of the apo&s;tle in the above recited words, that have been the occa&s;ion of difficulty to &s;erious chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>ONLY, before I come to this, I would make a previous note, and de&s;ire it may be particularly attended to, and all along remem|bered, in the following di&s;cour&s;e. It is this. The pa&s;&s;ages we are going to explain are not independant &s;entences, the proper meaning of which is to be gathered, from the meer force of the words, in them&s;elves &s;imply, and nakedly, con&s;idered, but parts of a well cohering di&s;|cour&s;e; and can therefore be explained in no way, but by con&s;idering the de&s;ign in view, the part they bear in the di&s;cour&s;e, and how they &s;tand connected with it. The not duly con&s;idering the&s;e things is, I believe, the rea|&s;on their true meaning has &s;o often been un|happily mi&s;under&s;tood. "Eating and drinking unworthily" at the Lord's table, con&s;idered in general, will never lead one into the true meaning of it in this place; becau&s;e the apo&s;tle
<PB N="124" REF="012350_0063_0F88F09ECFE398B0">
is &s;peaking of a &s;pecial ca&s;e, and the particu|lar unworthine&s;s of a particular number of chri&s;tians, which can be known in no way, but by con&s;ulting the context. The nature and meaning of this "unworthine&s;s" and the "&s;pecial puni&s;hment" incurred by it, mu&s;t be mea&s;ured by that, and by that alone; unle&s;s it may be thought allowable to break in upon the apo&s;tle's cour&s;e of rea&s;oning, and put a &s;en&s;e on his words that has no pertinency to the de&s;ign he is upon; which is certainly an unfair treatment of an human writing, and ought much le&s;s to be practi&s;ed in regard of one that is &s;acred, as being of divine in&s;piration.</P>
<P>HAVING made this remark, the way is clear to look into the context, as the only proper method to under&s;tand the apo&s;tle, in the phra&s;es we are about to explain. And by doing this we &s;hall find, that great di&s;orders, particularly with reference to the &s;acramental &s;upper, had crept into the Corinthian church. It was on account of the&s;e di&s;orders, that the apo&s;tle wrote this chapter; and if we would know, what that "unworthy eating and drink|ing" is, which he blames the&s;e Corinthians for, and would rectify for time to come, we mu&s;t know what the indecences, and di&s;orders were, that prevailed among them. For this
<PB N="125" REF="012350_0063_0F88F09ECFE398B0">
"unworthine&s;s" mu&s;t be explained by the&s;e di&s;orders.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle, before he comes to parti|cular in&s;tances of their mi&s;conduct, declares in general, as in the 17. ver. "I prai&s;e you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the wor&s;e". More is intended in the&s;e words than is expre&s;&s;ed. Their meaning is, far from commending you, I think you are greatly to be blamed. What I rebuke you for, and with &s;everity too, is, that, when you a&s;&s;emble together for the performance of the public offices of religi|on, you behave &s;o as that your coming to|gether, in&s;tead of being for your &s;piritual advantage, tends rather to the increa&s;e of your guilt.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;poken thus generally, he now comes to particulars; mentioning the &s;pecial in&s;tances, wherein they were blame worthy. And they are the&s;e that follow.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, their having divi&s;ions among them. Says he, (ver. 18.) "when ye come together in the church, I hear there are di|vi&s;ions among you; and I partly believe it." It &s;hould &s;eem it was by report from others, and not per&s;onal knowledge, that he became acquainted with this di&s;order in the church
<PB N="126" REF="012350_0064_0F88F09F5937A0A0">
at Corinth. But &s;uch was his intelligence, that he believ'd it "in part", or rather fully "of part" of the church. And a &s;can|dalous di&s;order this was. The word, (in the original <HI>Schi&s;mata</HI>) here tran&s;lated <HI>divi&s;ions</HI>; means, not meerly, or only, divi&s;ions in their <HI>affections</HI> towards each other, but divi&s;ions in their <HI>outward conduct.</HI> It is true, they met together in the &s;ame place for commu|nion at the Lord's-Supper, but it was in a &s;chi&s;matical manner, dividing them&s;elves into parties, and not appearing, as they ought to have done, as <HI>one body,</HI> affectionately united in commemorating the dying love of their common Lord. It cannot be deduced from any thing that is &s;aid in this chapter, or in any part of the epi&s;tle, that they had as yet &s;eparated from each other under the form of different <HI>&s;ects,</HI> meeting in different places for wor&s;hip: but the apo&s;tle tells them, that &s;o it might be expected it would be. The prejudices, the lu&s;ts, and un&s;ubdued tempers of men would lead to this, and God in his righteous providence might permit it, that it might be made to appear who, upon trial, would be approved as &s;tedfa&s;t and immoveable. So his words run, ver. 19, "For there mu&s;t be al&s;o here&s;ies [in the original,

It rather means what we call a <HI>&s;ect,</HI> or people in a &s;tate of &s;epera|tion from others, and meeting together as a different denomination. I have looked over all the places in the new te&s;tament, where the word is u&s;ed, and find that this is the &s;en&s;e in which it is to be under&s;tood, in every text, one only excepted, which may admit of di&s;pute.</NOTE>] among you, that they which are approved may be made manife&s;t among you". But though this corinthian church was not at pre&s;ent divided into two, or more &s;eparate &s;ocieties, but continued one chri&s;tian community, meeting together in the &s;ame place, yet they behaved in their a&s;&s;emblies in an unbrotherly, factious and &s;chi&s;matical manner. The apo&s;tle, accordingly, applies to them, as in the 20 ver. "when ye come to|gether therefore into one place, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">THE phra&s;e, in the original, epi to auto, being of the neutral kind, may as well &s;ignifie <HI>with the &s;ame de&s;ign, for the &s;ame thing,</HI> as <HI>to one place</HI>; and it is accordingly often &s;o to be under&s;tood. But the tran&s;la|tion here, <HI>to one place,</HI> be&s;t &s;uits the connection, as I imagine.</NOTE> this is not

As if he had &s;aid, though you a&s;&s;emble, as a chri&s;tian &s;ociety, in one and the &s;ame place, and there eat; yet you do it after &s;uch a man|ner, that it would be a di&s;honour to a &s;acred in&s;titution of Chri&s;t, to &s;peak of it as eating the Lord's-Supper. This leads to</P>
<P>A NUMBER of other faults, the&s;e Corin|thians are obviou&s;ly charged with, and &s;evere|ly reproved for; as we may &s;ee, in the 21, and 22d ver. in which they are thus addre&s;|&s;ed, "in eating every one taketh before other his own &s;upper, and one is hungry, and ano|ther is drunken. What! have ye not hou&s;es to eat, and to drink in? or de&s;pi&s;e ye the church of God, and &s;hame them that have not? &s;hall I prai&s;e you in this? I prai&s;e you not"?</P>
<P>THEIR having a "&s;upper of their own" in the hou&s;e of God, when about to cele|brate the &s;upper of the Lord, is here evi|dently &s;poken of as indecent and irregular. When the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "every one eateth before other his own &s;upper", it is ea&s;ie to perceive, that he alludes to a cu&s;tom which had obtained among them, whatever gave ri&s;e to it, namely, that of having a common fea&s;t in the place of wor&s;hip, here called "their

It does not appear, from any thing that is &s;aid in any pa&s;&s;age in the new-te&s;tament books, that the&s;e fea&s;ts were a divinely in&s;tituted preface, or appendix, to the Lord's-Supper. They were, without all doubt, the invention of man. Probably, they might take ri&s;e, with re&s;pect to both <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Gentile</HI> converts to the chri&s;tian faith, from the &s;ame general cau&s;e.</P>
<P>WE all know it was <HI>after</HI> our Lord had eat the <HI>pa&s;&s;over-fea&s;t</HI> with his di&s;ciples, that he eat with them <HI>his own &s;upper</HI>; and he did it with what remained of the pa&s;&s;over bread and wine, fir&s;t &s;olemnly &s;epa|rating them to the &s;pecial u&s;e of remembering him. The <HI>Judaizing chri&s;tians,</HI> under the guidance (it is likely) of <HI>Judaizing teachers,</HI> introduced of their own heads, tinged with jewi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, a &s;upper pre|vious to the Lord's as the Lord's-Supper, when fir&s;t in&s;tituted, was preceeded with the pa&s;&s;over-&s;upper. And this previous &s;upper of their's might, as to the principles of its introduction, favor &s;o much of that which was <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> in religion, as to give occa&s;ion of offence to the <HI>Gentile</HI> chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the <HI>Gentile</HI> chri&s;tians, as the Lord's-&s;upper was con&s;equent upon a fea&s;t, &s;ome of the me|terials of which were &s;et apart and con&s;ecrated in remembrance of Chri&s;t, might think it proper to pre|face the &s;upper of the Lord with one of their own, making u&s;e of the bread, and wine of their own &s;upper in their ob&s;ervance of our Lord's. And there may be the more rea&s;on to give this ri&s;e to this pre|vious &s;upper among the greeks, as it is known to have been their cu&s;tom to have &s;ocial fea&s;ts or &s;uppers. I would add here, this <HI>previous &s;upper,</HI> thus differen|ced as to the cirum&s;tances attending its ri&s;e, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Gentile</HI> chri&s;tians, might be one occa&s;ion of the <HI>(Schi&s;mata) divi&s;ion:</HI> there were among them, and complained of by the apo&s;tle in the 18th ver.</P></NOTE> either previous to, or mixed with, the "Lord's-Supper."

Your con&s;ciences, duly enlightened, will reproach you for &s;uch un|&s;uitable conduct.

<P>ANOTHER irregularity they are rebuked for, is, their confounding, or &s;o mingling, "their own" with the "Lord's-Supper," that they were neither properly, nor &s;ufficiently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from each other, as they ought to have been. It is with &s;pecial reference to this di&s;order, that the apo&s;tle charges them, ver. 29, with "not di&s;cerning the Lord's-body", or, as the original words, [<HI>m&ecirc; dia|k<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&ocirc;n</HI>] might, perhaps, be more properly ren|dered, "<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">t differencing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So the original word means, and is tran&s;lated to mean, in the following texts, Act. 15.9. 1. Cor. 4.7. Jude ver. 22.

from the bread of "their own &s;upper" And in their way of celebrating the "&s;upper of the Lord", it is plain it was not &s;uitably differenced, or di&s;criminated, from their "own &s;upper"; not did it appear, as it ought to have done, an open, &s;olemn, religious decla|ration, or &s;hewing forth, of his death.</P>
<P>ANOTHER fault &s;till they are charged with is, their &s;o eating their own &s;upper as to be|tray a want of that kindne&s;s, yea, that com|mon decency, which would have been blame-worthy in tho&s;e who knew nothing of chri&s;ti|anity. By comparing the 21&s;t with the 33d ver. we &s;hall find, that they did not "tarry for one another", but as they came to the place of wor&s;hip fell to, as the vulgar phra&s;e is, and eat every one of what he had brought; by which means tho&s;e who had brought a plenty were &s;atiated, while tho&s;e who, being poor, had brought nothing, were made a&s;ha|med, not having wherewithal to keep them from hunger. A &s;trange manner of conduct this! It not only di&s;covered the pre&s;ent inope|ration of that brotherly kindne&s;s, which is the glory of a chri&s;tian, but downright incivility; and they are both aggravated, as they were now purpo&s;ely a&s;&s;embled, and a&s;&s;embling,

that they might unite in celebrating a &s;acred rite of the religion of Je&s;us. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE di&s;order complained of, in the above para|graph, always appeared unaccountable to me, until I had the opportunity of reading Raphelius's "philolo|gical annotations"; where I met with the&s;e words, vol. ii. pag. 344, "moris fuit athenis"&mdash;that is, "it was a cu&s;tom among the athenians, in the age of So|crates, for per&s;ons who came to a &s;upper, to bring every one of them &s;omething for him&s;elf; which was not made common to all, but for the mo&s;t part every one eat that which was his own. An example of this he holds out to view from Xenophon, in his "memorab". lib. 111. pag. 623; which is as full an illu&s;tration of this di&s;order among the Corinthians as can be de&s;ired. The words are the&s;e; "<HI>Opote de</HI>"&mdash;In engli&s;h thus, "when of tho&s;e who came together that they might &s;up, &s;ome had brought with them a very little, others a great deal of provi&s;ion, Socrates ordered a lad to put the little in common, or to di&s;tribute to each a part: In con&s;equence of which, tho&s;e who had brought a plenty with them were both a&s;hamed not to partake of what was &s;erved up in common, and not to produce their own. They therefore put down their provi&s;ions in common, and becau&s;e they enjoyed no more than tho&s;e who had brought but little, they defi&s;ted from expending much in procuring victuals". It &s;hould &s;eem, from this citation, that even a Socrates was a&s;ha|med of that di&s;orderly conduct among the <HI>pagan</HI> Greeks, at their <HI>collation &s;uppers,</HI> which appears to have been continued among the Corinthians after their conver&s;ion to chri&s;tianity.</NOTE></P>

the&s;e Corinthians, was their <HI>exce&s;s,</HI> or <HI>intempe|rance</HI>; which, at any time, is highly criminal, but eminently &s;o when about to eat bread, and drink wine, at the &s;acramental &s;upper. The charge again&s;t them, in the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t ver. is, not only that, "in eating every one taketh before other his own &s;upper", but that, while "one is hungry, another drunken". It has been thought &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e chri&s;ti|ans, e&s;pecially while together in order to cele|brate &s;o &s;olemn a rite as that of the Lord's-Supper, &s;hould be chargeable with <HI>drunkenne&s;s,</HI> literally and gro&s;sly &s;peaking.

And this was the thought I was led to entertain of this matter, until I had given it a more critical examination; &s;ince which I ima|gine, it may ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected, that &s;ome, among tho&s;e who had brought a &s;ufficiency for a full repa&s;t, were guilty of intemperance in too gro&s;s a &s;en&s;e of the word. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THE principal rea&s;on inclining me to judge, that &s;ome of the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors at Corinth, were chargeable with intemperance in a wor&s;e &s;en&s;e than expo&s;itors commonly &s;uppo&s;e, is this. The word, <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">thuci,</HI> here tran&s;lated, <HI>is drunk,</HI> really means, in all its grammatical variations, throughout the new te&s;ta|ment, and is accordingly tran&s;lated in our bibles &s;o as to mean, this kind of intemperance, one place only excepted; which, perhaps, had as well been tran&s;lated, &s;o as to carry a &s;en&s;e more nearly agreeing with that, in which all the others are taken, as we may &s;ee pre&s;ently. In the mean time I would ob&s;erve, the &s;ub&s;tantives, <HI>Methu&ecirc;,</HI> and <HI>Methu&s;os,</HI> are to be met with in five texts: the former in three, Luk. 21.34. Rom. 13.13. Gal. 5.21.; the latter in two, 1 Cor. 5.11. and 6.10. The verb pa&s;&s;ive, <HI>Methuskomai,</HI> is found in three places, Luk. 12.45. Eph. 5.18. 1 The&s;. 5.7. The verb active, <HI>Metheu&ocirc;,</HI> is u&s;ed, be&s;ides in John 2.10, the excepted place, in Matt. 24.49. Acts 2.15, in the text we are upon, in The&s;. 5.2. Rev. 17.2, and in the &s;ixth ver&s;e: In all which texts, it not only &s;ignifies, but by our tran&s;la|tors is made to &s;ignifie, a gro&s;&s;ly faulty exce&s;s in drink|ing. It would therefore carry with it the appearance of a de&s;ign to &s;erve a cau&s;e, &s;hould we depart, in this place, from the invariably tran&s;lated, as well as genu|ine &s;en&s;e of the word, wherever it is to be met with in the new-te&s;tament books: Not is it ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e|able, the apo&s;tle would have u&s;ed this word, which has &s;o bad a meaning, if he had in tended only &s;ome light degree of exce&s;s. It will, probably be &s;aid here, it would be too great a reflection on any of the&s;e chri&s;ti|ans to &s;ugge&s;t, that they were intemperate to the ex|ce&s;s that has been mentioned; and that the want of candor only could influence any to put &s;o &s;evere a &s;en&s;e on the word u&s;ed by the apo&s;tle. The plain an&s;wer is, the apo&s;tle would not have u&s;ed this word, if he had not intended to convey by it the &s;en&s;e it is always taken in, and by him&s;elf too, every where in the &s;acred books. The charge therefore of too great &s;everity in reflecting upon the&s;e chri&s;tians, if ju&s;t, mu&s;t light upon the apo&s;tle, and not on tho&s;e who interpret his words according to their invariable u&s;e, both in the go&s;pels, and epi&s;tles. The only way to expre&s;s candor towards them is to ob&s;erve, in mitigation of their fault, which was a very gro&s;s one, that intemperance at <HI>collation &s;uppers,</HI> among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> had been common; and the <HI>pa&s;sover meal,</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> was allowed to be a full one; and too often it was carried into exce&s;s. If therefore &s;ome of the&s;e chri&s;tians, whether from judai&s;m, or gentili&s;m, through the force of habit not fully eradicated, and by being off their guard, had been unhappily betrayed into what may be ju&s;tly called in|temperance in drinking, it ought not to be looked upon as incredible. Dr. Whitby's note on the word, <HI>Os de metheuci, and another is drunken,</HI> I &s;hall think proper to in&s;ert here. Says he, "This may either refer to the <HI>Gentile</HI> converts among the corinthians, retaining &s;till their <HI>heathen</HI> cu&s;tom of drinking liberally after their &s;acrifices, whence <HI>methuci<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be drunk,</HI> is, by grammarians, thought to have its original from <HI>meta to thuein,</HI> becau&s;e of the free drinking they indulged to after their &s;acrifices; or to the <HI>judaizing</HI> concerts,, who thought them&s;elves obliged to drink plentifully at their fe&s;tivals, four large cups of wine, &s;ays Dr. Lightfoot, at the <HI>Pa&s;chal-&s;upper,</HI> and to be quite drunk, &s;ays Buxtorf in the fea&s;t of <HI>Purim</HI>".&mdash;I have now given my opinion. Let every one judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid ju&s;t now, there was a text, John 2.10, in which the &s;ame word, that is here u&s;ed by the apo&s;tle, is tran&s;lated in our bibles, well drank"; not importing any criminal degree in drinking. There was no need of giving the word &s;o low a &s;en&s;e, and &s;o different an one from that in which it is every where el&s;e taken in the new-te&s;tament. For, let it be ob&s;er|ved, what is here &s;aid was &s;poken, not by our Savior, nor as in&s;inuating a charge again&s;t any of the pre&s;ent gue&s;ts, but referring to what had been a cu&s;tom upon &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions. The word, <HI>methusth&ocirc;fi,</HI> might therefore here have well enough been tran&s;lated in a &s;en&s;e nearer to the genuine import of the word, in other texts of the new te&s;tament. The "new ver&s;ion of the new-te&s;ta|ment", by an anonymous author, has it thus, "when the gue&s;ts had drank pretty freely". Harwood, in his late "tran&s;lation of the new-te&s;tament", gives it this &s;en&s;e, "when the ta&s;te of company was blunted with drinking". And if it had been literally and &s;trictly tran&s;lated, "when they were overcome with drink", It would, as I imagine, have been but a fair and ju&s;t ver&s;ion; nor would &s;uch a one have carried with it the lea&s;t reflection, either upon our Savior, or any of the gue&s;ts with whom he was now at a wedding. The word refers wholly to a cu&s;tom, in that day at wedding-fea&s;ts; when if &s;ome of the company had drank too much, it would not have been &s;trange; and, perhaps this was no uncommon thing.</P></NOTE></P>

Some, through weak|ne&s;s, the undue influence of fear, or a mind unhappily tinctured with &s;uper&s;tition, have been kept from the &s;acramental &s;upper, be|ing led, by the&s;e words, to imagine, that, &s;hould they unworthily partake of it, they would be chargeable with the very &s;in the Jews were, when, literally &s;peaking, they "wounded the body, and &s;hed the blood of Chri&s;t". But this is &s;o vain an imagination, &s;o gro&s;s a contradiction not only to the known u&s;e of the&s;e words in &s;cripture, but to com|mon &s;en&s;e, that the bare mentioning of it is &s;ufficient to expo&s;e it as ridiculou&s;ly ab&s;urd. "The body and blood of Chri&s;t", here &s;po|ken of, are to be interpreted, not in the lite|ral, but figurative &s;en&s;e. They mean, not "his real body and blood", but the&s;e &s;ymbo|lically con&s;idered, or as repre&s;ented under the emblematical &s;igns of "bread and wine", at the &s;acrament. So the words were meant by our Savior in the in&s;titution of the &s;upper, and &s;o they are under&s;tood by the apo&s;tle Paul in this very chapter, in the account he has given of the original con&s;ecration of "the bread and wine".</P>

<P>"EATING and drinking, damnation to one's &s;elf", in ca&s;e of eating and drinking "unwor|thily" at the Lord's table. The engli&s;h word, <HI>damnation,</HI> does not an&s;wer to the true import of the greek word (<HI>Krima</HI>) here u&s;ed by the apo&s;tle. And it is a thou&s;and pities it was thus tran&s;lated, as it has been, unhappily, the occa&s;ion of much perplexity to many &s;erious good chri&s;tians. Says the excellent Dr. Dod|dridge, in his note upon this word, "I think it the mo&s;t unhappy mi&s;take in all our ver&s;ion of the bible, that the word, <HI>Krima,</HI> is here rendered <HI>damnation.</HI> It has rai&s;ed a dread in tender minds, which has greatly ob&s;tructed the comfort, and edification, they might have re|ceived from this ordinance".

con&s;ulted all the expo&s;itors, and writer, upon the &s;acramental &s;upper, I could come to the &s;ight of, I find, that they unite as one in &s;peaking of the "judgment", more e&s;peci|ally intended here by the apo&s;tle, as of the temporal kind, not of "damnation" in the fu|ture world. It is true, this word (<HI>Krima</HI>) is &s;ometimes u&s;ed to &s;ignify the damnation of hell; but it oftner means judgment in this pre&s;ent &s;tate. The apo&s;tle Peter &s;ays, (1. Epi&s;. 4.17.) "The time is come, when judgment (<HI>Krima</HI>) is to begin at the hou&s;e of God". Will any one &s;ay, damnation to future wrath is the judgment here meant? It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed. The evangeli&s;t Luke (chap. 23.40.) brings in one of the malefactors, who were crucified with our Lord, rebuking the other in the&s;e words, "do&s;t thou not fear God, &s;eeing thou art (<HI>en to Krima</HI>) in the &s;ame condemnation"; that is, adjudged to one and the &s;ame temporal death: Yea, in the 24th chap. 20th ver. he &s;peaks of the chief prie&s;ts, and rulers, as having delivered our Lord (<HI>en Krima thanaton</HI>) to be condemned to death: Not &s;urely to damnation in a future world. It would be bla&s;phemous to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch an untruth. From the&s;e texts it appears, that the word (<HI>Krima</HI>) we are now explaining, may, agreeably to its u&s;e el&s;ewhere in &s;cripture,
<PB N="143" REF="012350_0072_0F88F0A9E0C9A958">
mean, not puni&s;hment in hell, but temporal evil in this world.</P>
<P>AND that this was the judgment the apo&s;tle had directly in his eye, when he made u&s;e of the word <HI>Krima,</HI> which, in our bibles, is tran&s;la|ted "damnation", he has taken all proper care to put beyond all rea&s;onable di&s;pute. For, let it be particularly minded, in the ver&s;e im|mediately following that wherein he &s;ays, "he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to him&s;elf", he adds, as though on purpo&s;e to prevent our mi&s;taking his meaning, in the u&s;e of the word tran&s;lated damnation, "FOR THIS CAUSE, many are weak, and &s;ickly among you, and many &s;leep". As if he had &s;aid, your di&s;orderly, prophane man|ner, at the &s;acramental &s;upper, has brought down upon you the judgments of God. <HI>For this cau&s;e,</HI> on account of this your unworthi|ne&s;s, he has vi&s;ited you [perhaps, a miracu|lous vi&s;itation may be here intended] with bodi|ly di&s;ea&s;es, and temporal death it&s;elf: And this you have had exemplified among you, in many in&s;tances of tho&s;e, who have been &s;ick, and died. But to make it yet more certain, that by this <HI>Krima,</HI> which has been unhappi|ly tran&s;lated by the engli&s;h word "damnation", in our bibles, we are to under&s;tand temporal judgment, and not the mi&s;eries of hell, the
<PB N="144" REF="012350_0073_0F88F0AA6F9F1DC8">
apo&s;tle, in the 32d ver. has expre&s;sly a&s;&s;igned, the rea&s;on of the infliction of the puni&s;hment (<HI>Krima</HI>) he had &s;poken of. His words are the&s;e, "when we are judged, we are cha&s;tened of the Lord, that we might not be condemn|ed with the world". You ob&s;erve, the evil, or puni&s;hment, be it what it may, to which the&s;e Corinthians had been adjudged, for their un|worthy behaviour at the Lord's table, is here con&s;idered, by the apo&s;tle him&s;elf, as <HI>di&s;cipli|nary</HI> only, a "divine cha&s;tening"; and as inflicted too, with a view to <HI>prevent their dam|nation</HI> in the other world. It is impo&s;&s;ible therefore, the puni&s;hment, he here connects with this unworthine&s;s, &s;hould mean, being of the medicinal kind only, any other than tem|poral judgment. In a word, the apo&s;tle, far from giving the lea&s;t countenance to the &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>Krima,</HI> as tran&s;lated "damnation", and meaning the "damnation of hell", has &s;aid that which is obviou&s;ly and abundantly &s;uffici|ent to lead every intelligent reader to under|&s;tand by it, <HI>temporal puni&s;hment</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as had been inflicted upon &s;ome of the&s;e Corinthians, but in a way of <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> only, and in order to prevent their <HI>damnation,</HI> beyond the grave, with the wicked world.</P>
<P>IT will, perhaps, be a&s;ked here, does not unworthy eating and drinking at the Lord's

table expo&s;e to damnation in the other world? I an&s;wer; without all doubt it does. And &s;o does unworthy hearing of God's word, unworthy praying to our father who is in Heaven, and unworthy performing any du|ty whatever in religion. The exact truth is, every &s;in, of whatever kind, or in whatever degree, whether it be a &s;in of omi&s;&s;ion, or commi&s;&s;ion, does as really expo&s;e to damnati|on, as unworthy eating and drinking at the Lord's-Supper.</P>
<P>BUT this notwith&s;tanding, <HI>future damnati|on</HI> is not the puni&s;hment, the apo&s;tle more immediately intends, in the pa&s;&s;age we are upon; but, as has been &s;aid, temporal <HI>evil,</HI> which he explains by the&s;e words, "weakne&s;s, &s;ickne&s;s, and the &s;leep of death". Neither does he connect, even, this temporal judg|ment with every &s;ort, or degree, of unworthy receiving the &s;acrament; but with that gro&s;sly irreverent, and prophane manner, in which the Corinthians received it. So that none have any ju&s;t rea&s;on to apply that &s;pecial puni&s;h|ment, here &s;poken of, be it what it may, to them&s;elves, unle&s;s they can charge them&s;elves with attending on the ordinance of the &s;up|per in the like wicked manner, which the&s;e Corinthians did; which is not much to be feared at this day. Their &s;candalous irregu|larities,
<PB N="146" REF="012350_0074_0F88F0AC1C013468">
e&s;pecially their divi&s;ive, intempe|rate manner at the Lord's-Supper, for which God, perhaps beyond the ordinary cour&s;e of nature, &s;ent &s;ickne&s;s and death among them, are not the faults we are in pre&s;ent danger of falling into the commi&s;&s;ion of. Tho&s;e, to be &s;ure, are at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance from this unworthine&s;s, who come not to the &s;acramental table from a con&s;ciencious fear, le&s;t they &s;hould be chargeable with it. They, of all per&s;ons in the world, have the lea&s;t rea&s;on to apply this text to them&s;elves. Their ca&s;e as widely differs from that of the&s;e Corinthians, as light differs from darkne&s;s. And as their ca&s;es are thus altogether different, it is quite be&s;ide the apo&s;tle's intention, and a downright abu&s;e of his words, to perplex their minds, and di&s;|courage them&s;elves from duty, in con&s;idera|tion of that, which is no ways applicable to them.</P>
<P>I MAY not improperly &s;ubjoin a few words here, in order to undeceive tho&s;e, who ground a fear, from this pa&s;&s;age of the apo&s;tle we have been upon, le&s;t they &s;hould be certainly and unavoidably <HI>damned,</HI> &s;hould they happen to eat and drink at the &s;acramental &s;upper, in an unworthy manner. This, I have rea&s;on to think, has given perplexing unea&s;ine&s;s to &s;ome &s;erious &s;ouls, re&s;training them from
<PB N="147" REF="012350_0074_0F88F0AC1C013468">
remembering Chri&s;t in the way of his appoint|ment. But they have herein gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon them&s;elves. Should it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the apo&s;tle was &s;peaking, in this text, of dam|nation in the coming world, which we have &s;een abundant rea&s;on to think he is not, he ought by no means to be under&s;tood, as mean|ing, that it would inevitably prove damnation to a per&s;on, &s;hould he come to the table of the Lord, and eat and drink there in an un|worthy manner. For the go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God has provided, through Chri&s;t, and promi|&s;ed, pardoning mercy to repenting &s;inners, however many, or heinous, their &s;ins may have been. Unworthily receiving the &s;acrament may therefore, in common with all other unwor|thine&s;s, be forgiven by the intervention of repentance, and &s;o damnation be prevented. Should a per&s;on unhappily come to the &s;upper of the Lord, &s;o as to be an unworthy gue&s;t there, through negligence, carele&s;sne&s;s, or any other faulty cau&s;e, he might, by the grace of God, be brought to repentance; and this would as certainly &s;ecure him from damnation, as it is true, that God is "ready to pardon", and embrace penitent &s;inners in the arms of his mercy. Without all doubt, many are now in heaven, and many will, in time to come, have admi&s;&s;ion into this ble&s;&s;ed place, who
<PB N="148" REF="012350_0075_0F88F0ACC0A7BD68">
have often been at the &s;acramental table in an unworthy manner: not becau&s;e it was not their &s;in; but becau&s;e, by repentance, they obtained the forgiving mercy of God.</P>
<P>I HAVE now particularly, though as briefly as I well could, explained tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle Paul, which have been the occa&s;ion of fears and &s;cruples in the minds of many, with re&s;pect to their attendance on the in&s;titu|tion of the &s;upper, and re&s;trained them from coming to it.

There is no danger of your u&s;ing the &s;acramental bread and wine, which repre&s;ent figuratively, "the body and blood of Chri&s;t", in the rude, factious, prophane manner they did.

<PB N="152" REF="012350_0077_0F88F0AEE9088C10">
to the holy &s;upper, le&s;t you &s;hould "eat and drink <HI>damnation</HI> to your&s;elves? Your fear, &s;o far as it takes ri&s;e from the engli&s;h word, <HI>damnation,</HI> has no ju&s;t rea&s;on for its &s;upport. For, it is not expre&s;&s;ive of what the apo&s;tle Paul means by the greek word <HI>Krima,</HI> he here u&s;es; as has, I tru&s;t, been already made abun|dantly to appear.</P>
<P>NOT but that "eating, and drinking unwor|thily", at the Lord's table, expo&s;es to "damna|tion", meaning by it damnation to wrath in the future world; and you may rea&s;onably fear &s;o eating and drinking, as to render your&s;elves liable to this awful puni&s;hment: Not indeed becau&s;e this puni&s;hment is the <HI>&s;pecial judgment</HI> intended by the apo&s;tle; but becau&s;e it is the puni&s;hment el&s;ewhere, in &s;cripture, threatned again&s;t &s;in in general, be its kind, or degree, what it may. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, therefore, that you are afraid of coming to the Lord's-Supper, le&s;t by doing this unworthily, you &s;hould "eat and drink damnation to your&s;elves", you &s;hould fear le&s;t, by an <HI>unworthy neglect</HI> of this ordinance, you &s;hould expo&s;e your&s;elves to this &s;ame puni&s;hment. For the truth is, there is as real danger of incurring damnation by a neglect of this in&s;tance of duty, as by an unworthy performance of it. You, who fear to come to the &s;acramental &s;upper, le&s;t you ex|po&s;e
<PB N="153" REF="012350_0077_0F88F0AEE9088C10">
your&s;elves to damnation, while, at the &s;ame time, you have no fear upon your minds, le&s;t, by the neglect of this &s;acred in&s;titution, you &s;hould as ju&s;tly make your&s;elves liable to the &s;ame puni&s;hment, would do well &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider this. There is like danger in both ca&s;es; and you will only delude your&s;elves, if you think to avoid the danger of eating and drinking unworthily, by not eating and drink|ing at all.</P>
<P>IT may, perhaps, be &s;aid here, the apo&s;tle Paul has particularly denounced damnation again&s;t <HI>unworthine&s;s</HI> at the Lord's-Supper, while neither he, nor any of the &s;acred pen|men, have, with like particularity, pointed out this puni&s;hment, in ca&s;e of not coming to it. The an&s;wer is obvious, and, as I imagine, intirely &s;atisfactory. The apo&s;tle, in the words referred to, is &s;peaking, as has been made evi|dent, of temporal judgment, and inflicted only with a &s;alutary view, in a way of fatherly cha&s;ti&s;ement; not of damnation, meaning by it puni&s;hment beyond the grave: Nor is this kind of puni&s;hment denounced any where, in the bible, again&s;t unworthy receiving the &s;a|crament, but in tho&s;e texts which denounce this &s;ame wrath again&s;t the <HI>neglect of duty,</HI> as well as the unworthy performance of it. So that a di&s;obedient neglect of that &s;upper which
<PB N="154" REF="012350_0078_0F88F0B292AAABD8">
has been &s;olemnly appointed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, does as really expo&s;e to damnation, as an un|due attendance at it. Why then &s;hould any ab&s;tain from &s;acramental eating and drinking, through fear, le&s;t they &s;hould eat and drink un|worthily? Sin lies at the door in either ca&s;e, and danger too. And it is, without all doubt, both <HI>more &s;inful,</HI> and <HI>more dangerous,</HI> with re|&s;pect to the per&s;ons who&s;e fears I have been endeavouring to remove, to <HI>neglect coming</HI> to the &s;acramental &s;upper, than to come to it with that imagined <HI>unworthine&s;s</HI> which keeps them from it.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER remark is this, that, &s;hould any have unhappily attended the ordinance of the &s;upper in an unworthy manner, the be&s;t advice to them is, not to cea&s;e from attending their duty in this &s;pecial in&s;tance; but to take proper care to perform it better for time to come. This remark naturally ari&s;es from the general tenor of the apo&s;tle's di&s;cour&s;e, in the chapter we have been con&s;idering. He had been blaming, and rebuking, the church at Corinth for their rude, di&s;orderly, and prophane manner of celebrating the holy &s;upper. And what does he hereupon advi&s;e them to? Does he forbid them the u&s;e of this go&s;pel ordinance? Does he &s;ay any thing tending to di&s;courage them from going again to it? Not a word
<PB N="155" REF="012350_0078_0F88F0B292AAABD8">
of this nature is to be &s;een in any part of what he has wrote to them. Far from this, though they had come to the &s;upper of the Lord with &s;uch indecency, and irreverence, as are not known in the pre&s;ent age, he &s;uppo&s;es it to be their duty &s;till to come to it; and what he endeavours is, to engage them, by proper ar|guments, to reform what had been ami&s;s, and to attend their duty in a &s;uitable manner in time to come. Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors would act wi&s;ely in taking due notice of the apo&s;tle's care, that the holy &s;upper might not be neglected, and, at the &s;ame time, that it might not be un|worthily celebrated. Should they be con&s;ci|ous, that they have waited upon Chri&s;t at his table in an unbecoming manner, they &s;hould not be di&s;couraged, through fear, from waiting upon him again; but &s;hould rather be excited to give the more earne&s;t heed, to get their un|worthine&s;s removed, that they may attend their duty conformably to the will of their Lord for the future.</P>
<P>I MAY not improperly add here, if any of tho&s;e are &s;eriou&s;ly thoughtful of coming to the &s;upper of the Lord, who have never as yet been there, they &s;hould not be di&s;couraged from their duty, in this re&s;pect, by the influence of fear, le&s;t they &s;hould come unworthily. Their fear &s;hould not drive them away from this ordi|nance,
<PB N="156" REF="012350_0079_0F88F0B2AB57B7E8">
but rather put them upon the u&s;e of proper pains, that they may come in a worthy manner. The Corinthians had been guilty of &s;chi&s;m, rudene&s;s, and intemperance in their ce|lebration of the &s;acramental &s;upper; and yet, the apo&s;tle does not advi&s;e them to lay a&s;ide the u&s;e of this ordinance, but to take care to come to it, for the future, in worthy manner. And this is the be&s;t advi&s;e that can be given chri&s;ti|ans at this day. It is not allowable for them to treat this ordinance with con&s;tructive con|tempt, by ab&s;taining from the u&s;e it; and if they are afraid of coming to it unworthily, the effect of their fear &s;hould be, their more diligent endeavour to come in the manner they would de&s;ire, and as may be for the honor of their Lord.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER remark &s;till may be, that it ought not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the apo&s;tle Paul, in the chapter we have been explaining, had it in his heart to di&s;courage tho&s;e chri&s;ti|ans, from an attendance at the &s;acramental table, who di&s;courage them&s;elves, and from what he has &s;aid too. Let us attend a little to their character, more e&s;pecially as drawn from the ground of their di&s;couragement. Why are they kept back from remembering their Lord, in the way of his appointment? Is it not becau&s;e they fear, le&s;t they &s;hould not
<PB N="157" REF="012350_0079_0F88F0B2AB57B7E8">
do this with that faith, love, humility, and holy reverence, which become a &s;acred in&s;titu|tion of go&s;pel wor&s;hip? Is it not becau&s;e they have worthy &s;entiments of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has appointed the &s;acramental &s;upper, and would willingly be communicants at it, but that they have &s;cruples in their minds, as to their fitne&s;s to be &s;o? Is it not becau&s;e they are jealous over them&s;elves with a Godly jealou&s;y, jealous of the honour of their Lord, and would &s;erve him with their be&s;t? Is it not becau&s;e they are heartily de&s;irous of plea&s;ing Chri&s;t, and are afraid, le&s;t they &s;hould fail of doing &s;o, &s;hould they come to his table?</P>
<P>CAN it now be imagined, with any face of rea&s;on, that it was the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle, by any thing he has &s;aid, in this chapter, to di&s;|courage this kind of per&s;ons from giving their pre&s;ence at the &s;acramental &s;upper? Could it have entered his heart to block up their way to the table of the Lord? It ought not to be &s;uppo&s;ed. Surely, if he did not di&s;cou|rage the Corinthians from attending this ordi|nance, though they came to it in &s;uch an irreve|rent manner, as that they were vi&s;ited by God, FOR THIS VERY CAUSE, with "weakne&s;s, &s;ick|ne&s;s and death," he could never intend to throw any di&s;couragement in the way of the per&s;ons I have de&s;cribed. And if he could know
<PB N="158" REF="012350_0080_0F88F0B38E8AEA68">
how they have mi&s;con&s;trued his words, and taken occa&s;ion, from them, to neglect the &s;upper of the Lord, he would &s;carce be able, though in heaven, to refrain from grief. And could he now &s;peak to them from the excel|lent glory, it would be to advi&s;e them forth|with to lay a&s;ide their fears and &s;cruples, and honor their Lord by celebrating the memorial of his death.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE la&s;t remark is, that it &s;hould be the &s;erious endeavor of all to come worthily to the table of Chri&s;t. The apo&s;tle Paul aimed main|ly at this, in all that he &s;aid to the Corinthians, in that part of his epi&s;tle to them we have been con&s;idering. To this end he &s;et before them their faults, and gave them the directi|ons proper, in order to their rectifying them, that they might come to the &s;upper Chri&s;t had appointed, not to condemnation, but to prai&s;e and honor. And this &s;hould be the care al&s;o of all, who profe&s;s them&s;elves the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us. They &s;hould not e&s;teem it a matter of trifling concern, how they partake of the &s;ym|bols of their Lord's death, but &s;hould endeav|or to do it, &s;o as to glorify God, and promote their own &s;piritual advantage.</P>
<P>MANY, I am &s;en&s;ible, would be glad to come to the &s;acramental &s;upper who were never there; and what has kept them back is, this
<PB N="159" REF="012350_0080_0F88F0B38E8AEA68">
matter of worthily partaking there. Being convinced, that they ought to come worthily, they are re&s;trained from coming, becau&s;e they fear they &s;hall not be able thus to come. But this is a difficulty that will as truly hold again&s;t all the other duties of religion. They ought all to be performed in a worthy man|ner; and if per&s;ons &s;hould imagine they can|not thus perform them, why may they not as rea&s;onably leave them all undone, as this of remembering their Savior at his &s;upper? Is this right? What mu&s;t be the effect of &s;uch conduct but a total di&s;regard to all the &s;er|vices of piety? The exact truth is, the influ|ence of fear, re&s;pecting the &s;upper of the Lord &s;hould never be, to keep us from it, but to excite our care that we may be welcome gue&s;ts at this go&s;pel fea&s;t; and thus we &s;hall be, if the &s;ubjects of that meetne&s;s, which is &s;uited to the nature and de&s;ign of the duty. And this meetne&s;s, I will venture to &s;ay, tho&s;e are certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, who are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of their unworthine&s;s, and mo&s;t fearful le&s;t they &s;hould di&s;honour Chri&s;t, by an undue attend|ance at his table. With re&s;pect to per&s;ons of this character, there is no danger of their rudely, or irreverently, ru&s;hing upon this ordinance. They are the men, who are mo&s;t concerned, that they may be prepared for a
<PB N="160" REF="012350_0081_0F88F0B4331A2B28">
due approach to it; and there is no doubt but they ought to be ranked among tho&s;e, who would be mo&s;t welcome to it.</P>
<P>I have now &s;aid all that I had in view to &s;ay, in the choice of the &s;ubject I have been &s;o long upon. I have, in as plain and faithful manner as I could, laid before you the obligations chri&s;tians are under to celebrate the in&s;tituted memorial of their Lord's dying love. I have been particu|lar in &s;peaking to the carele&s;s and &s;ecure; the luke|warm and indifferent; the con&s;cientious and careful, in re|gard of their attendance on the other in&s;titutions of go&s;pel wor&s;hip; and, in fine, the &s;crupulous and fearful: endea|vouring to con&s;ider, and remove, all the doubts, difficulties and fears, which have kept any from an attendance at the table of Chri&s;t, &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as they have come within reach of my knowledge.</P>
<P>WHAT will be the effect of my having been thus large, and full, in treating upon this &s;pecial article of chri&s;tian du|ty, is known to God only. If what has been di&s;cour&s;ed may, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, be influential upon any to do honor to their Savior, by remembering him in the way he has pre&s;cribed, it will be labor &s;pent to good purpo&s;e. It will occa&s;ion joy of heart to all the friends of Je&s;us; yea, it will be plea&s;ing to him, who loved us, and died for us; yea, it will be a plea&s;ure to that God, who &s;o loved us, even while we were &s;inners, as to give his only begotten Son to be &s;lain a &s;acrifice to atone for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. But if what has been &s;aid &s;hould prove labor in vain, as being fol|lowed with no good effect, as having no influence to prevail upon any to join with their chri&s;tian friends in breaking of that bread, which is the &s;ymbol of Chri&s;t's broken body, it will be remembered another day, that you have been faithfully entreated, warned, directed, and encouraged to the practice of this article of duty; and you will be the more inexcu&s;able on this account. I &s;hall only &s;ay, I have delivered my &s;oul, and have done it faithfully in this in&s;tance, however defective I may have been in others. The good God grant, that this chri&s;tian point of practice, which has been &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;olemnly urged, may prove a &s;avor of life unto life unto many, and not of death unto death&mdash;to any one &s;oul.</P>
