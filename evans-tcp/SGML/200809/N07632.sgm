<OPENER><DATELINE>BOSTON,
<DATE>Jan. 17, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the great vanity which you di&s;cover, and the &s;elf-important airs which you a&s;&s;ume thro'out your &s;landerous <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> I conclude you &s;uppo&s;ed that I would either enter the li&s;ts with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as a &s;hrewd polemical writer, or el&s;e be wholly &s;ilent, from a conviction of my inability to defend the &s;ermons which you have attack'd in &s;o heroic a manner. But if you imagined either of the&s;e things, you was under a mi&s;take. If ever I enter into a formal controver&s;y with any per|&s;on upon &s;uch points, it &s;hall be with One, who appears to me to have both a better head, and hone&s;ter heart than you have di&s;covered in this &s;pecimen of your abilities, and zeal for what you call orthodoxy. And yet I do not think it convenient to be quite &s;ilent upon this occa&s;ion. Tho' my &s;ermons need no elaborate, argumentative de|fence again&s;t your ratiotinations, and impertinent critici&s;ms; yet &s;o much rudene&s;s and in&s;olence, &s;o much mi&s;repre&s;en|tation and &s;lander, fal&s;ehood and forgery as your libel contains, &s;hould not, methinks, be pa&s;&s;ed over without &s;ome animadver&s;ions: E&s;pecially &s;ince it is probable that this will be read chiefly by tho&s;e who have never &s;een the &s;ermons afore&s;aid; and who may be &s;o ignorant of you, as to imagine you had too much integrity and honor to mi&s;repre&s;ent and fal&s;ify them. It is partly upon this con&s;ideration, that I give you and my&s;elf the pre&s;ent trouble; my principal aim being, not to di&s;pute with, but to cha&s;tize and admoni&s;h you, for your real good; and to make you an example and warning to others. If in doing this, I &s;hould tran&s;iently touch upon the merits of
<PB N="4" REF="009737_0003_0F7A4B348B4ACEE0">
the cau&s;e, theologically con&s;idered, you are not to flatter your&s;elf, that I mean to controvert &s;uch points with you; whom I con&s;ider as a per&s;on wholly unworthy to be rea|&s;oned with about them, any farther than is requi&s;ite to &s;hew your di&s;hone&s;ty and wickedne&s;s with reference to them.</P>
<P>If I had really publi&s;hed any material errors in point of doctrine, let me tell you, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> that you was one of the mo&s;t un&s;utable per&s;ons in the world, to undertake a confutation of them, or to &s;et your&s;elf up for an author, tho' you &s;ay, p. 4, that you have 'an un|doubted right' to do it. I am &s;en&s;ible that Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects have a legal right to <HI>expo&s;e them&s;elves</HI> in print, on politics, divinity, or any other &s;ubject: And if this is what you in&s;i&s;t on as an invaluable privilege, I would by no means have your liberty, or that of the pre&s;s re&s;trained. But you &s;peak, p. 3. of 'Divines of indi&s;putable ability for &s;uch an undertaking', as that of <HI>vindicating the truth again&s;t me.</HI> Can you then po&s;&s;ibly think it became you, an ob&s;cure per&s;on from another province, and one &s;o un|letter'd as you are; an out-ca&s;t from the college to which you was a di&s;grace; for &s;ome time a rambling itinerant, and promoter of di&s;orders and confu&s;ion among us; &s;o raw and un&s;tudied in divinity; one hardly ever heard of among us, but in the frequent reports of your follies and extravagances, and at length &s;et up as a mini&s;ter to an a&s;&s;embly of &s;eparati&s;ts;&mdash;Can you po&s;&s;ibly think it be|came <HI>you</HI> to turn author upon this occa&s;ion; and to take this &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary work of defending the <HI>mo&s;t im|portant principles</HI> of the prote&s;tant religion again&s;t me, out of the hands of <HI>our Divines of indi&s;putable ability?</HI> What unaccountable vanity and infatuation was this! And you have pre&s;umed to pa&s;s an implicit cen&s;ure on tho&s;e <HI>Divines</HI> al&s;o, by &s;aying, p. 3.
<Q>I <HI>marvel</HI> that none of our divines of indi&s;putable ability for &s;uch an undertaking, have <HI>attempted</HI> to vindicate the truth again&s;t him</Q>
&mdash;Is not this a proof, that none of our <HI>able Divines</HI> thought there was any <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> for oppo&s;ition to me? And do not you &s;hew the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;urance, in thus &s;etting up your <HI>little</HI> &s;elf in oppo&s;ition to their opinion, as well as
<PB N="5" REF="009737_0004_0F7A4B34FA15FEC0">
to my &s;ermons? Poor, unhappy man! You doubtle&s;s thought to emerge from your ob&s;curity, and to appear as a per&s;on of &s;ome con&s;equence, by this vain attempt. But you have great rea&s;on to wi&s;h, you had continued as unnoticed as ever: For it were much better to remain as unknown as heretofore, than to be only more <HI>infamous;</HI> as you are at lea&s;t in a fair way now to be, by means of your libel.</P>
<P>If it were my intention to write to you as a &s;cholar, logician or divine, I would take &s;ome notice of the con|fu&s;ion and want of method, &s;o apparent thro'out your <HI>E&s;&s;ay;</HI> the needle&s;s and numberle&s;s repetitions therein; and your running the propo&s;ed heads of it into each other: So that one had almo&s;t as good look for what you pro|po&s;e under any particular one, under any of the other, as that. This is particularly ob&s;ervable with re&s;pect to the three <HI>latter</HI> of them, which are the principal. And even under your <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the de&s;ign of which, you &s;ay, is, to men|tion &s;everal things in which you "agree" with me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus it is expre&s;&s;ed p 4.
<Q>I. Mention &s;everal things, WE agree with the Dr. in</Q>.
So p 7. 'Yea, WE &s;tick not to &s;ay'.&mdash;p 95. 'OUR &s;y&s;tem of doctrine'&mdash;97. 'Another principle of OUR &s;y&s;tem' &mdash;After this manner he &s;peaks in numerous other places: WE, OUR, US. &amp;c. As if all this wrong headed creature's whim&s;ies were the common cau&s;e of prote&s;tants, and him&s;elf a di&s;tingui&s;hed champion therefor. Who can help &s;miling at the folly and impertinence of this, that is not too much provok'd at the in&s;olence &amp; arrogance of it?</NOTE>, you mention near as many, I think, in which, you &s;ay, we <HI>di&s;agree.</HI> But it is as much beneath me to play the <HI>critic</HI> on &s;uch a performance as yours, as it would be par|ticularly to expo&s;e the vanity of your critici&s;ms on my &s;ermons. Let me here only ju&s;t ob&s;erve by the way, that if I agree with you in &s;o many things as you &s;ay I do, this is a better pre&s;umptive evidence, that I am under &s;ome <HI>mi&s;takes,</HI> than any which you have produced. For I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for any one to be of your opinion in many points of doctrine, without being in the <HI>wrong</HI> with re&s;pect to &s;ome.</P>
<P>But I will now proceed to the main bu&s;ine&s;s of this Letter, which is, to &s;et your fal&s;ehood, and iniquitous proceedings with reference to my &s;ermons, in &s;ome <HI>order
<PB N="6" REF="009737_0005_0F7A4B35C3B65910">
before your eyes;</HI> and to admini&s;ter the reproof and cor|rection which you de&s;erve; or rather a <HI>part</HI> thereof. For it is only they that hold the &s;word of <HI>public</HI> ju&s;tice, that can legally puni&s;h &s;uch wickedne&s;s to the <HI>extent</HI> of its demerits. Your villainy in this affair appears written, as one may &s;ay, even upon your forehead; I mean in your title-page: In which you have the a&s;&s;urance to repre&s;ent me to the world, as an enemy to 'the mo&s;t important principles' of the prote&s;tant religion; particularly 'the doctrine of Chri&s;t's &s;acrifice and atonement', &amp;c. On which, you there &s;ay, I ca&s;t 'injurious a&s;per&s;ions'. After the word <HI>atonement,</HI> you indeed in&s;ert the&s;e clau&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>as being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the pardon of &s;in, con|&s;i&s;tently with God's infinite and unchangeable <HI>rectitude</HI></Q>;
&mdash;that you might have an hole to creep out at. But this will not &s;erve your turn. You know, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> in your con&s;cience, that I did not deny any nece&s;&s;ity of atonement, ari&s;ing from wi&s;dom, fitne&s;s, the ends of go|vernment, or the moral character of God; but rather &s;aid what implies it, as will hereafter appear to your confu&s;ion, unle&s;s you are pa&s;t all &s;hame. How then could you have the confidence, becau&s;e my expre&s;&s;ions concerning atone|ment do not exactly corre&s;pond with yours, to repre&s;ent me to the world, as ca&s;ting 'injurious a&s;per&s;ions' on it? by which you doubtle&s;s intended &s;omething beyond a &s;im|ple denial of it. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that I am charged, in this villainous title-page, with <HI>injuriou&s;ly a&s;per|&s;ing</HI> other important doctrines of the go&s;pel, be&s;ides that of Chri&s;t's atonement; unle&s;s you will &s;ay, that there are &s;ome 'mo&s;t important principles in the prote&s;tant reform|ed &s;y&s;tem of chri&s;tianity', which are not them&s;elves real and important doctrines of the go&s;pel; and therefore that I may be &s;uppo&s;ed to <HI>a&s;per&s;e</HI> the former, tho' I maintain the latter: Which, I conclude, you will not &s;ay. Indeed, nothing is more manife&s;t, than that it was your formal in|tention to <HI>a&s;per&s;e</HI> me, as an enemy to &s;ome of the mo&s;t fundamental doctrines of the chri&s;tian religion; which you accordingly <HI>e&s;&s;ay</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed injurious a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t on them in my &s;ermons. You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that this is a very high charge to be brought a|gain&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="009737_0006_0F7A4B36815BABE8">
one who is, at lea&s;t by his &s;tation and profe&s;&s;ion, a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel. But I have the le&s;s rea&s;on to be any ways unea&s;y at your di&s;like of my &s;ermons, be|cau&s;e I think it pretty evident that you do not well like the <HI>text</HI> it&s;elf, in its plain, literal &s;en&s;e; or, in other words, that you do not really believe, 'The Lord is good to ALL, and his tender mercies over ALL his works.' Had you believed this to be &s;trictly true, I do not think you would (I am &s;ure you could not <HI>con&s;i&s;tently</HI>) have made &s;uch a tragical out-cry again&s;t tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>But having made the&s;e cur&s;ory remarks on the iniquity of your title-page, as well as the vanity of your intro|duction, and the impertinence and confu&s;ion of your <HI>fir&s;t</HI> head; I &s;hall now pa&s;s on to your <HI>&s;econd:</HI> which is thus expre&s;&s;ed in your libel, p.9.
<Q>To take notice of the Dr's evident <HI>de&s;ign.</HI></Q>
And this, you immediately add, was,
<Q>To repre&s;ent the divine goodne&s;s in &s;uch a light as to &s;hew, there was no ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t to make atonement, or to &s;atisfy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;hould be remembered, that the &s;cripture makes u&s;e of no &s;uch language as this, of Chri&s;t's <HI>&s;atisfying divine ju&s;tice,</HI> in any one place. However, the author of this letter is far from having any di&s;po&s;ition to contend about mere words. If tho&s;e who expre&s;s them&s;elves after this manner, intend no more by the <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> of Chri&s;t, than is implied in his <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> or <HI>atonement,</HI> (as they ought not to do) he makes no objection again&s;t it; but a&s;&s;erts the doctrine of &s;atis|faction him&s;elf, in this &s;en&s;e; as is evident even from tho&s;e &s;ermons which have been attack'd in &s;o outrageous a manner.</NOTE> divine ju&s;|tice, in order to God's forgiving the &s;ins of men con|&s;i&s;tently with his moral goodne&s;s.</Q>
Upon which let it be remarked in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P>That if I had, in expre&s;s terms, a&s;&s;erted the non-ne|ce&s;&s;ity of atonement or &s;atisfaction, in order to the forgive|ne&s;s of &s;in; this would have been no more than &s;ome eminent prote&s;tant Divines have done; even <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> Divines; whom, I conclude, you account the mo&s;t <HI>reform|ed</HI> of any. I will particularly mention but one of them; the famous Dr. <HI>Twi&s;&s;e,</HI> who was in &s;uch high reputation with the <HI>A&s;&s;embly of Divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> that he was cho&s;en and &s;erved as <HI>Prolocutor,</HI> or <HI>Chairman</HI> of that venerable a&s;&s;embly. And his opinion ought, perhaps, to
<PB N="8" REF="009737_0007_0F7A4B3757A5CD70">
have almo&s;t as much weight as that of Mr. <HI>Cleaveland</HI> of <HI>Ip&s;wich.</HI> The Dr. has nine folio pages in his <HI>Vindiciae Gratiae</HI> &amp;c. upon this point; beginning p. 198. under the head <HI>De Electione</HI>; the <HI>eighth Digre&s;&s;ion,</HI> as he terms it:
<Q>In qu&acirc; probatur po&s;&s;e Deum per potentiam ab&s;olutam vel CITRA SATISFACTIONEM peccata remittere, &s;imulque ad Lubberti &amp; Pi&s;catoris contra&s;entientium rationes re&s;pon|detur</Q>.
Which, for the &s;ake of you, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> and my other Engli&s;h readers, I here tran&s;late&mdash; <HI>In which it is proved, That God can forgive &s;ins by his ab&s;olute power, even</HI> WITHOUT SATISFACTION; <HI>and al&s;o the rea&s;onings of Lubbertus &amp; Pi&s;cator, who think other|wi&s;e, are an&s;wered.</HI> It immediately follows,
<Q>Po&s;&s;e Deum vel citra &s;atisfactionem peccata remittere, juxta potentiam ejus ab&s;olutam, adeo manife&s;tum mihi videtur, ut extra controver&s;iam ponendum e&s;&s;e facile cen&s;erem.</Q>
i. e. <HI>That God can forgive &s;ins even without &s;atisfaction, by his ab&s;o|lute power, appears &s;o manife&s;t to me, that I &s;hould think it a point which ought to be placed beyond all controver&s;y.</HI> Afterwards,
<Q>Si Deus non po&s;&s;it peccata &s;ine &s;atisfactione remittere; tum vel quia non pote&s;t per <HI>potentiam,</HI> vel quia non pote&s;t per JUSTITIAM. At <HI>neu|trum</HI> horum dici pote&s;t,</Q>
&amp;c. i. e. <HI>If God cannot forgive &s;ins without &s;atisfaction; this is either becau&s;e he cannot, with re&s;pect to power, or becau&s;e he cannot, in re&s;pect of</HI> JUSTICE. <HI>But neither of the&s;e things can be affirmed,</HI> &amp;c. From hence it is manife&s;t, that this eminent <HI>Calvini&s;tic</HI> Divine, in high repute with the We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly, for which you expre&s;s &s;o great a veneration, was full and po&s;itive in his opinion, that &s;in might have been forgiven without <HI>any</HI> &s;atisfaction; and particularly, that the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of God did not indi&s;pen&s;ibly require it. This he thought &s;o plain a point, that it ought not to be called in que&s;tion. If, therefore, I had as expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted the &s;ame thing, did it become <HI>you,</HI>&mdash;I &s;ay, <HI>you,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> to inveigh again&s;t me for it; and to load me with &s;o much obloquy? Could you not differ from me in opinion, and yet ob&s;erve &s;ome &s;ort of decorum and mode&s;ty in your oppo&s;ition?</P>
<P>But let me remind you in the next place, that I did not a&s;&s;ert the po&s;&s;ibility of forgivene&s;s without atonement.
<PB N="9" REF="009737_0008_0F7A4B3809D58C30">
So far from it, that the manner in which I expre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf upon this point, rather implied a <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity there|of in order to forgivene&s;s: And &s;urely you will not a&s;&s;ert any other kind of nece&s;&s;ity, or a <HI>natural</HI> one, as contradi&s;|tingui&s;hed from <HI>moral.</HI> At lea&s;t, I am per&s;uaded that no man who under&s;tands what he &s;ays, &s;uppo&s;es any other: What <HI>you</HI> may do, I cannot &s;ay.&mdash;That I denied not &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity, but rather &s;uppo&s;ed it, will fully appear here|after; together with your wilful fal&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> iniquity with reference hereto.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, I &s;hall make a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> on the method which you take to prove that I had the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> afore&s;aid. You infer this from what I &s;aid of divine ju&s;tice, con&s;idered as a branch or mode of goodne&s;s; which opinion of mine you &s;uppo&s;e, without any rea&s;on, to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine of atonement. But what an iniquitous method of proceeding is this? Upon &s;uppo&s;ition I was mi&s;taken about divine ju&s;tice, (which I am per&s;uaded no man can prove) is this a &s;ufficient ground to charge me with &s;uch a <HI>de&s;ign</HI> as you &s;peak of? This is the &s;ame kind of di&s;hone&s;ty, that it would be in any one to accu&s;e you of dei&s;m or athei&s;m, becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ome of your principles, being pur&s;ued into their ju&s;t con&s;equences, would terminate therein; which probably may be the ca&s;e. But yet I &s;hould think it injurious to charge you with a de&s;ign to propagate dei&s;m or athei&s;m, while you profe&s;s the contrary; even tho' you have &s;hewn &s;o little regard to truth and integrity, as you have done in many parts of your libel. One in&s;tance hereof may indeed be found in this part of it, p. 9. Where you in&s;inuate that I hold <HI>every</HI> act of punitive ju&s;tice in God, to be intended for the good of the <HI>individual,</HI> on whom it terminates. You &s;ay,
<Q>Now if ju&s;tice, even punitive ju&s;tice in God, is only a mode or modification of his goodne&s;s, or kindne&s;s and beneficence towards his creatures, then the great end (as the Dr. &s;ays it is) of God's exerci&s;ing punitive ju&s;tice, mu&s;t be "the good of his creatures," and even the good of <HI>tho&s;e that it is exerci&s;ed upon</HI>; and hence <HI>every</HI> act of punitive ju&s;tice mu&s;t be an act of kindne&s;s, "for it is goodne&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="009737_0009_0F7A4B38B78E84D8">
it&s;elf that gives the blow."</Q>
Here you refer to Serm. p. 21. Now would not any one who never read my &s;er|mons, and took you for an hone&s;t man, conclude from hence, that I &s;uppo&s;ed it would be unju&s;t for God to pu|ni&s;h any &s;inner more than would be for his <HI>own</HI> good? Indeed you &s;ay expre&s;ly, p. 10. that according to my prin|ciples,
<Q>God would not be perfectly good but cruel, if he &s;hould puni&s;h them</Q>
[&s;inners]
<Q>any farther than would be for <HI>their</HI> good or happine&s;s</Q>
&mdash;Now are you not a|&s;hamed, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> of &s;uch prevarication as this? I did indeed compare God's acts of punitive ju&s;tice to tho&s;e of a wi&s;e and good earthly parent or &s;overeign; who has always <HI>&s;ome</HI> good or benevolent de&s;ign in puni&s;hing. But then I expre&s;ly guarded, as you know, again&s;t the &s;uppo|&s;ition, that all acts of punitive ju&s;tice, whether in God or man, are acts of kindne&s;s to the &s;uffering individuals. That tho&s;e who have never read my &s;ermons, may &s;ee it is not without good rea&s;on that I accu&s;e you of di&s;hone&s;ty in this re&s;pect, I &s;hall here extract a few pa&s;&s;ages from them, out of many to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>SPEAKING of the motive from which a wi&s;e and good parent puni&s;hes his children, when he is under the influ|ence, not of mere <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> but of rea&s;on only, I &s;ay,
<Q>Is it not in order to reform, and do them good?&mdash;or at lea&s;t with a view <HI>to the benefit of his other children,</HI> or <HI>tho&s;e of the hou&s;hold</HI>;&mdash;that they may be kept under due &s;ubjec|tion, &amp;c.&mdash;So that in a good parent, as was &s;aid before, there is no &s;uch quality as ju&s;tice, <HI>really di&s;tinct from goodne&s;s;</HI> not even in puni&s;hing: <HI>For it is goodne&s;s it&s;elf that gives the blow,</HI></Q>
Serm. p. 21. This la&s;t clau&s;e you di&s;hone&s;tly introduce, as if I had not only u&s;ed it expre&s;ly concerning God; but had thereby intended to a&s;&s;ert, that he never puni&s;hes a &s;inner, but for his <HI>own good,</HI> in di&s;tinc|tion from the <HI>public</HI> or <HI>common:</HI> And is not this a wicked, wilful perver&s;ion of my evident meaning? Again:</P>
<P>SPEAKING ju&s;t after, of a wi&s;e and good earthly &s;ove|reign, I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf thus,&mdash;
<Q>Neither does he inflict any puni&s;hments, but what he con&s;iders as needful for the &s;upport of his government;&mdash;if not for the particular
<PB N="11" REF="009737_0010_0F7A4B39CE7848E0">
good of <HI>tho&s;e that &s;uffer,</HI> as in capital ca&s;es, yet for the good of his <HI>people in general,</HI> by way of example and terror, that good order may be pre&s;erved. So that even in this ca&s;e of exci&s;ion, or capital puni&s;hment, the ju&s;tice of the &s;overeign is no real quality in him, di&s;tinct from goodne&s;s. It is goodne&s;s, or a regard to <HI>common good,</HI> that takes off the head of the traitor,</Q>
&amp;c. p. 21, 22. It is afterwards ob&s;erved, that God is often repre&s;ented to us in &s;cripture under the characters of a Father and a King; 'the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> and <HI>be&s;t</HI> Father, the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> and <HI>be&s;t</HI> King,' p. 23, 24. And after quoting Heb. XII. 6&mdash;12. where God is repre&s;ented as cha&s;tening us 'for our profit,' I go on thus, p. 25.
<Q>No man will deny, but that God is at once ju&s;t and good in the&s;e cha&s;tenings. Goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice in him, therefore, are not to be con&s;idered as <HI>oppo&s;ites</HI>: They <HI>may,</HI> in all other ca&s;es without exception, be co|incident; the latter being, <HI>perhaps,</HI> only a particular modification of the former, and tending to po&s;itive good, <HI>at lea&s;t the public or common.</HI></Q>
And you your &s;elf, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> know, and have often acknowledged, particu|larly p. 15. that I &s;peak of the <HI>future</HI> puni&s;hment of wicked men in the language of &s;cripture, as <HI>eternal, ever|la&s;ting,</HI> &amp;c. How then could you have &s;o much di&s;hone&s;ty and impudence, as to repre&s;ent it to the world as my doctrine, or at lea&s;t implied in my doctrine concerning divine goodne&s;s, that <HI>every</HI> act of punitive ju&s;tice in God, is an act of kindne&s;s to the individual puni&s;hed; or that God's end therein is the good even
<Q>of tho&s;e, that it is exerci&s;ed upon</Q>?
Was not this very fooli&s;h al&s;o, as well as injurious? For do you think you can make the world believe that I either a&s;&s;erted or &s;uppo&s;ed, it was for the good of &s;inners them&s;elves to be <HI>eternally</HI> puni&s;hed? For &s;hame, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland;</HI> what do you think of your&s;elf? Or what opinion do you &s;uppo&s;e the world can have, either of your &s;en&s;e or hone&s;ty in this re&s;pect? You proceed upon the &s;ame <HI>known</HI> fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition, when you &s;o pertly demand, p. 10.
<Q>And if God's punitive ju&s;tice is po&s;itive kindne&s;s, or if <HI>all</HI> his acts of puni&s;hing, are acts of po&s;itive kindne&s;s, how could the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, the ju&s;t for
<PB N="12" REF="009737_0011_0F7A4B3A434A1250">
the unju&s;t, be an effect of God's love, mercy and grace? Is it an act of love, mercy and grace, to <HI>withold from &s;inners an act of po&s;itive kindne&s;s?</HI></Q>
Fye! Mr. <HI>Cleave|land.</HI> You know that, according to my principles, &s;inners may be ju&s;tly puni&s;hed by way of terror and example to others, for the &s;upport of government, order and <HI>common</HI> good, tho' them&s;elves are not benefitted, nor de&s;igned to be benefitted thereby. And Chri&s;t's atonement, or his &s;uffering, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, or in the room, place or &s;tead of &s;inners, (which I &s;uppo&s;e the true, natural import of that expre&s;&s;ion) was not in order to their being exempt|ed from any di&s;ciplinary correction, or medicinal puni&s;h|ment, for their real good; (for thus the &s;aints are corrected, or puni&s;hed, notwith&s;tanding Chri&s;t &s;uffered for them) but in order to their being exempted from that puni&s;h|ment, to which they might otherwi&s;e have been &s;ubjected, in order to vindicate the honor of Gods law and govern|ment; for the &s;upport of order, and therein for the good of the univer&s;e, which e&s;&s;entially depends thereon. And if the&s;e ends may be an&s;wered by the &s;ufferings of a me|diator or &s;ub&s;titute, as I &s;uppo&s;e, I hope you will allow it to be an 'act of love, mercy and grace,' to appoint a me|diator to &s;uffer thus, in order to prevent our &s;uffering per|&s;onally, by way of example and warning, as malefactors do in the ca&s;e of capital puni&s;hment; tho' it would not be an act of love, mercy and grace,
<Q>to withold from &s;inners an act of <HI>po&s;itive</HI> kindne&s;s,</Q>
or any puni&s;hment which is for their good; as you, at once with equal folly, effrontery and malice, &s;ugge&s;t it would be, upon my principles.</P>
<P>YOU go on with your imaginary proof of the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> imputed to me; but really, only in further expo&s;ing the naughtine&s;s of your heart. You &s;ay,
<Q>This de&s;ign farther appears from what the Dr. &s;ays in p. 64 and 65; where he plainly intimates, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity of the atonement of Chri&s;t, in reference to <HI>any &s;uch divine ju&s;tice in God,</HI> that mu&s;t be &s;atisfied by the &s;ufferings or death of Chri&s;t, that men might be pardoned or &s;aved; "&s;uch idea of divine ju&s;tice, mu&s;t be wholly and forever ex|cluded.</Q>

double comma's, you cite as mine; tho' they are altered, &s;o as not to give your readers a true idea of my meaning. You have here the confidence to in&s;inuate, that I denied the atonement of Chri&s;t had any reference to the ju&s;tice of God, the honor of his law and government; or was de&s;igned to exempt &s;inners from that puni&s;hment, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been inflicted upon them. This is your manife&s;t intention; and yet it is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, and you know it to be &s;o. You know that in the places, to which you refer, I did not &s;peak of divine ju&s;tice in general, as if Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings had no reference thereto; but only of a particular notion of ju&s;tice, as if it were in nature wholly and ab&s;olutely di&s;tinct from goodne&s;s; for which, I &s;uppo&s;e, there is no foundation in rea&s;on or &s;cripture. But, in&s;tead of fairly quoting my words, you had the di&s;hone&s;ty to mutilate them in &s;uch a manner, as to give your unwary readers quite a wrong conception of my meaning; as if I had, in general terms, denied <HI>any</HI> ju&s;tice in God, to which the &s;atisfaction [atonement] of Chri&s;t had reference, in order to the pardon of &s;in. Are you not a&s;hamed of &s;uch a wicked artifice as this, at once to &s;lander me, and impo&s;e upon your readers?</P>
<P>YOU proceed in the &s;ame page, viz. 10. to cite me thus&punc; in order to prove your point: I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the &s;en|tence ju&s;t as it &s;tands in the libel&mdash;"We are a&s;&s;ured (&s;ays he) in the holy &s;criptures, that God forgives the &s;ins of men thro' this great &s;acrifice (of Chri&s;t) intervening, <HI>rather</HI> than without any." This is your pointing; here you make a period for me, where I made only a comma, the &s;en&s;e being incomplete. It immediately follows in the &s;ermon, p. 64. after the comma at the word <HI>any,</HI>&mdash;
<Q>not becau&s;e he is deficient in goodne&s;s, or not perfectly merciful, but becau&s;e he is infinitely <HI>wi&s;e</HI> as well as mer|ciful; taking &s;uch a method herein, as is in its nature admirably adapted to
<Q>magnify the law and make it honourable,</Q>
i. e. to beget and pre&s;erve in the minds of rea&s;onable creatures a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of God's authority, the dignity of his laws and government: Which, as was in|timated before, is evidently be&s;t even for them&s;elves.</Q>
<PB N="14" REF="009737_0013_0F7A4B3BB99A5298">
Now, had you quoted the &s;entence intire, in&s;tead of muti|lating it in the &s;hameful manner you have done, it would probably have convinced every di&s;cerning and unprejudiced man, that you had injuriou&s;ly repre&s;ented my de&s;ign. No per&s;on, &s;urely, that under&s;tands him&s;elf, will &s;ay, that the appointing a mediator to atone for &s;in, and forgiving us thro' him, proceeded from any want of goodne&s;s or mercy in God. Nor can any thing be &s;aid more hono|rary to the atonement, than that God provided it, 'becau&s;e he was infinitely <HI>wi&s;e</HI> as well as merciful; taking &s;uch a method,' &amp;c. But all this latter part of that long &s;entence you di&s;hone&s;tly leave out, making a period at the word <HI>any;</HI> and go on to comment upon the former part thus:
<Q>q. d. There was no ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;acrifice intervening; God might have forgiven &s;in without any; but <HI>of the two,</HI> he cho&s;e rather to do it with than with|out any.</Q>
You quote and point that part of the &s;entence ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner, I think, ten or a dozen times in your libel; and often give the like comment upon it: As if I intended, that God might, con&s;i&s;tently with the &s;up|po&s;ition of his infinite wi&s;dom, and his moral perfections, (all &s;ummarily comprehended in goodne&s;s) have forgiven the &s;ins of men, in a method not wi&s;e and good, or at lea&s;t not &s;o wi&s;e and good as that which he actually cho&s;e. You pretend to give my &s;en&s;e thus,&mdash;'of the two he cho&s;e <HI>rather</HI> to do it with than without any': Which evidently amounts to this, that <HI>of the two,</HI> God cho&s;e to act as be|came an infinitely wi&s;e and perfect being, <HI>rather</HI> than to act as did not become &s;uch an One! My expre&s;&s;ion does not any more &s;uppo&s;e that God might, con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections, have forgiven the &s;ins of men without the atonement of Chri&s;t, than it does, that he might in any, or all other re&s;pects in general, have acted a part different from that which is the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t. And do you find neither <HI>nature</HI> nor <HI>grace</HI> inclining you to blu&s;h, Mr. <HI>Cleave|land,</HI> when you &s;ee your perver&s;ene&s;s and di&s;hone&s;ty thus expo&s;ed to the world! If either of them, I am per&s;waded it is the <HI>former,</HI> corrupt as it is; for a rea&s;on which I leave to be conjectured&mdash;You go on thus, p. 11. 'But why
<PB N="15" REF="009737_0014_0F7A4B3C79AD3A70">
did God chu&s;e to do it with a &s;acrifice, rather than with|out any?' What impudence is this! Did I not plainly inform you <HI>why,</HI> both negatively and po&s;itively, in that part of the &s;ame &s;entence, which you &s;o felloneou&s;ly left out?&mdash;<HI>viz.</HI> 'not becau&s;e he was <HI>deficient in goodne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>not perfectly merciful</HI>; but becau&s;e he was infinitely <HI>wi&s;e</HI> as well as merciful; taking &s;uch a method herein, as is in its nature admirably adapted <HI>to magnify the law, and make it honourable.</HI>' Is not this a &s;ufficient rea&s;on,&mdash;that this method was infinitely wi&s;e, and admirably adapted to an&s;wer the mo&s;t important ends in the divine government? What would the man have? It might perhaps have plea&s;ed you, who, it &s;eems, have &s;o little regard either for wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s, or even common hone&s;ty, (in writing) if I had &s;aid that the atonement had not its foundation in, or ri&s;e from, infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. For it &s;eems, that to &s;ay it had, is, in your depraved opinion, to ca&s;t <HI>injuri|ous a&s;per&s;ions</HI> upon it: In which, it is to be hoped, that no wi&s;e and good man will agree with you.</P>
<P>BUT it &s;eems you would farther infer my <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to &s;hew the non-nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's atonement, from my words quoted by you in the la&s;t-mentioned page. Speaking of that pa&s;&s;age, Heb. II.9, 10.&mdash;<HI>It</HI> BECAME <HI>him,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;aid,
<Q>It became his wi&s;dom, it became his goodne&s;s&mdash;There was a fitne&s;s and congruity in it, as the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t method of &s;aving &s;inful men, without any kind of refe|rence to that common, but yet &s;trange &s;uppo&s;ition, of divine ju&s;tice <HI>being intirely di&s;tinct</HI> from divine goodne&s;s.</Q>
&mdash;Therefore, to be &s;ure, I &s;uppo&s;ed there was no moral nece&s;&s;ity of atonement, with reference to divine ju&s;tice in <HI>any &s;en&s;e!</HI> This is evidently what you de&s;ign to make your readers believe, p. 11. after citing the pa&s;&s;age afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>NOW the di&s;hone&s;ty of this appears divers ways: Ac|cording to my idea of God's goodne&s;s, it is
<Q>always to be con&s;idered as in&s;eparably connected with his <HI>wi&s;dom;</HI> and regulated thereby in <HI>all</HI> its operations. It is not to be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of blind in&s;tinct, or good-nature; detached from rea&s;on and right, or a regard to fitne&s;s and propriety.</Q>
(Serm. p. 14.) And being thus con&s;idered, I
<PB N="16" REF="009737_0015_0F7A4B3D3A048DE8">
&s;uppo&s;ed that it comprized the whole moral character of God, even his <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> The&s;e things you knew; for you have quoted many pa&s;&s;ages to this purpo&s;e, only to pervert them; as may appear hereafter. You therefore doubtle&s;s knew, that when I &s;aid, it became the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God to forgive the &s;ins of men, thro' the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, I did not &s;peak of his goodne&s;s in the common re&s;trained &s;en&s;e, but as including his ju&s;tice; in a &s;en&s;e analogous to that, in which the goodne&s;s of a wi&s;e prince or parent in|cludes ju&s;tice. So that if the atonement of Chri&s;t had any reference to goodne&s;s in this &s;en&s;e, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;ome, indeed a particular reference to ju&s;tice. And this evidently appears to have been my meaning, becau&s;e I expre&s;ly &s;peak of it, in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, as a method 'admirably adapted to magnify the law, and make it ho|norable,' &amp;c. which could not be &s;aid with any propriety, if the atonement had no reference to ju&s;tice and law. What then became of your hone&s;ty or your &s;en&s;es, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> when you wrote as you did? Be&s;ides; this very pa&s;&s;age, which you have u&s;ed &s;o villainou&s;ly, is intro|duced in a manner, which plainly &s;uppo&s;es I allowed a &s;ort of moral nece&s;&s;ity of atonement, in order to the for|givene&s;s of mens &s;ins. For it is an an&s;wer to this ob|jection, which, I thought, &s;ome might po&s;&s;ibly make again&s;t the doctrine delivered by me&mdash;
<Q>What <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> was there for any atonement, upon the&s;e principles?&mdash;Whereas the &s;criptures <HI>con&s;tantly &s;uppo&s;e the need of it in order to the pardon of &s;in.</HI></Q>
Now, that the &s;criptures really &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>need,</HI> or nece&s;&s;ity of it in order to our forgivene&s;s, I plainly allowed: And accordingly went on to &s;hew, whence that need or nece&s;&s;ity aro&s;e, upon my own principles; <HI>viz.</HI> that the law of God might be <HI>magnified</HI> and made <HI>honour|able;</HI> that <HI>a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his authority, the dignity of his laws and government, might be begotten and pre&s;erved in the minds of rea&s;onable creatures; which is evidently be&s;t even for them&s;elves.</HI> And yet you have &s;uch a front, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> as to repre&s;ent me to the world as having <HI>in|juriou&s;ly a&s;per&s;ed</HI> the atonement of Chri&s;t as <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009737_0016_0F7A4B3ED00EEA88">BUT it is the word <HI>rather,</HI> as u&s;ed by me with reference to this point, that &s;eems chiefly to provoke your &s;pleen, and put you upon fibbing and raging in &s;uch an ungodly manner as you do.

This were doubtle&s;s a very palpable contradiction; &s;uch an one as few be&s;ides your&s;elf could be guilty of.

In the next place, tho' I had actually expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in that manner, I &s;hould not have been guilty of the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency. For I never denied a moral nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's atonement, in order to God's maintaining the dignity of his laws and government, while he forgives the &s;ins of men; tho' you have the front to in&s;inuate that I did. Thirdly, your allowing, as you here do, that I a&s;&s;ert there was a nece&s;&s;ity of God's forgiving the &s;ins of men thro' Chri&s;t's atonement, if he did it at all; &s;ince
<Q>otherwi&s;e he could not maintain his own authority,</Q>

Now the manner of your commenting upon the word <HI>rather,</HI> as u&s;ed by me, (&s;uppo&s;ing this to be de&s;igned only as a comment) brings to my mind many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, in which the &s;ame word occurs: And I have been thinking what a notable expo&s;itor, ca&s;ui&s;t and divine you would appear, if you was to preach or print upon them, ob&s;erving the &s;ame rule and method of interpretation, that you have in expounding my words.

Again, it is &s;aid, 'Fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the &s;oul: but RATHER fear him that is able to de|&s;troy both &s;oul and body in hell.' The pious Mr. <HI>Cleave|land</HI> upon the place, in conformity to his own method of interpretation:

Mr. <HI>Cleaveland</HI> upon the place&mdash;
<Q>q. d.

But yet <HI>of the two,</HI> it is <HI>rather</HI> more becoming you to reprove, than to practi&s;e and encourage &s;uch works. This is all that can be &s;aid. The eternal rule of right, the honor of &mdash; the dignity of his laws and government, and the credit of chri&s;tianity in the world, are of <HI>&s;o &s;mall weight,</HI> that they do but <HI>ju&s;t turn the &s;cale,</HI></Q>
&amp;c. What excellent, u&s;eful and mo&s;t comfortable reflexions might the apo&s;tle's words afford to <HI>&s;ome people,</HI> being thus paraphra&s;ed?</P>
<P>I HAVE here taken the liberty, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> to com|ment for you, in your own way: giving the word <HI>rather,</HI> in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;ignification and force, that you have given it in my &s;ermon: Upon which inter|pretation of it, the grand argument of your libel turns. I might altogether with as much truth and ju&s;tice &s;ay, that I have delivered your natural, genuine &s;en&s;e of the&s;e &s;everal texts, as you can, that you have given mine, in your para|phra&s;e. Indeed I might add, that by what I have heard of your wild, &s;en&s;ele&s;s and extravagant way of preaching in times pa&s;t, I can &s;carce doubt but that you have often expounded &s;cripture as ridiculou&s;ly, as licentiou&s;ly and pro|fanely as you would have done, had you actually para|phra&s;ed tho&s;e &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, in the manner before ex|pre&s;&s;ed. And if you continue in the &s;ame way, tho' you &s;tile your&s;elf V. D. M. <HI>a mini&s;ter of God's word;</HI> it &s;hould have <HI>rather</HI> been V. D.

<P>IT is needle&s;s for me to &s;pend time to bru&s;h away the other flim&s;y, cobweb-rea&s;onings in the &s;econd part of your libel; and indeed it was my determination from the fir&s;t, not to enter into a di&s;pute with &s;uch a wrong-headed and wor&s;e-hearted wretch, any farther than was requi&s;ite to lay open

the villainy of this attack upon me. That you have wil|fully mi&s;repre&s;ented my de&s;ign, mi&s;quoted my words in &s;ome places, and put a mo&s;t perver&s;e con&s;truction upon them in others, is, I believe, very apparent to every impartial and intelligent per&s;on, who has ever compared your libel with my &s;ermons. And if any thing, coming from <HI>you,</HI> could a&s;toni&s;h me, (except &s;ober truth, &s;olid rea&s;oning and can|dor) after what I have already ob&s;erved in your libel, I &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed at the effrontery which you di&s;cover at the clo&s;e of your &s;aid &s;econd head, p. 15.

That <HI>you</HI> could not comprehend my <HI>whole</HI> de&s;ign, may be true; but that you under&s;tood more of it, than you was willing to own, and knowingly mi&s;repre&s;ented it, is appa|rent; particularly from your mi&s;quoting, curtailing, mang|ling and mi&s;pointing my words, and by your perver&s;e com|menting on the word <HI>rather:</HI> Whereas had you acted hone&s;tly, it would have at once appeared to your readers, that you was only expo&s;ing your&s;elf, by objecting again&s;t my &s;ermons, in the manner you have done.

<P>THE third head of your libel, from p. 15. to 47. is
<Q>to give a <HI>conci&s;e</HI> repre&s;entation of the doctrine of the di|vine attributes, together with &s;ome of the natural in|ferences, as held by prote&s;tant reformers.</Q>
This tedious medly of incon&s;i&s;tencies and ab&s;urdities, which you call a <HI>conci&s;e repre&s;entation,</HI> &amp;c. I take to be the marrow and quinte&s;&s;ence of &s;everal of your old &s;ermons, revi&s;ed and tran&s;cribed upon this occa&s;ion. You appear in mo&s;t parts of it to talk without any clear ideas; making as free with your Creator, almo&s;t, as if you was his equal, or compre|hended his nature as perfectly as he does him&s;elf. I con|&s;ider this as your &s;y&s;tem of divinity; and a greater piece of confu&s;ion and impertinence I hardly ever &s;aw. It is partly &s;uch precious, &s;ublime jargon as the wild, rambling exhorters u&s;ed to entertain the gaping rabble with, &s;eve|ral years ago, when you was one of them. Only by being printed, it appears rather more ridiculous, than if it were fo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">med out <HI>extempore.</HI> I &s;hall not mi&s;pend time by particularly expo&s;ing it.

Whether you have, or have not done this, even in the next page, I leave you and others to con&s;ider. Speaking there of me, you &s;ay,

Now, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> what do you think of &s;uch a repre&s;enta|tion as this?

But I leave you to enjoy the credit of the&s;e; not thinking them worthy of any par|ticular notice.</P>
<P>I PASS on to the 4th and la&s;t general head of your libel, which you expre&s;s thus, p. 47.
<Q>To take notice of &s;ome of the Dr's inaccuracies and incon&s;i&s;tencies.</Q>
I can|not but ob&s;erve here, that your whole libel contains but 108 pages, 61 of which belong to this la&s;t head; in which you was to play the <HI>critic</HI> upon my inaccuracies, and &s;hew your own wit and &s;agacity. Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> I never pre|tended to much accuracy in writing; but, methinks, it is a little merry, that you, of all men, &s;hould undertake to &s;hew my inaccuracies. When or where did you learn this curious art of critici&s;ing?&mdash;in what <HI>college?</HI> in what <HI>univer|&s;ity?</HI>&mdash;during the little time that you was <HI>permitted</HI> to continue at Yale-college?&mdash;Was you a <HI>fre&s;hman</HI> or <HI>&s;ophi|more,</HI> or of what &s;tanding was you, when you <HI>left</HI> that &s;eat of the mu&s;es? Tho' this was &s;o early, yet what an <HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> are you! But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that <HI>nature</HI> had done a great deal for you, without <HI>art.</HI> For, I think, it will be apparent to any one, that your critici&s;ms actually proceeded from <HI>nature</HI>; I mean <HI>human nature</HI> as it is commonly repre&s;ented&mdash;<HI>wholly evil and corrupt</HI>&mdash; To be &s;erious; had you not expo&s;ed your&s;elf enough be|fore, in quality of a theologian, and champion for the pro|te&s;tant faith in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>injurious a&s;per&s;ions</HI> ca&s;t up|on it by me, without pretending to &s;et up for a critic too! Should you not at lea&s;t have learnt the difference between ru&s;tic impudence and wit, between lying and critici&s;ing, be|fore you attempted to &s;hew your talents in this way? Whe|ther you did, or did not know the&s;e material differences, may appear to all who &s;hall think it worth while to com|pare your pretended critici&s;ms, with my &s;ermons. I am

far from de&s;igning a <HI>defence</HI> of them again&s;t you. I only mean to &s;hame you, if po&s;&s;ible, for your vanity and wicked|ne&s;s, by taking a cur&s;ory notice of &s;ome of your critici&s;ms. This being my chief aim, I &s;hall &s;carce meddle with any of them, in which folly and ignorance bear the greater part; but almo&s;t intirely confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e of them, in which impudence and fal&s;ehood are the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous. Some indeed may be briefly mentioned, in which it will not be ea&s;y to determine, whether the former or the latter are mo&s;t prevalent.</P>
<P>As to what you object concerning my u&s;ing the terms <HI>attribute</HI> or <HI>property</HI> and <HI>quality,</HI> as &s;ynonymous; I &s;hall only a&s;k you, What would be the material and preci&s;e dif|ference between one per&s;on's &s;aying of Mr. <HI>Cleaveland</HI> of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> that the <HI>attribute</HI> or <HI>property</HI> of &s;elf-conceit is very con&s;picuous in him, and another's &s;aying that the <HI>quality</HI> of &s;elf-conceit is &s;o? Which of the&s;e would be the greate&s;t compliment, or the mo&s;t <HI>accurate</HI> way of &s;peaking? In p. 48. you &s;peak of me as having repre&s;ented God as
<Q>a <HI>com|pound</HI> being, made up of as many di&s;tinct &s;elf-exi&s;tent qualities or <HI>parts,</HI> as he has divine attributes.</Q>
Now what foundation had you for this, be&s;ides a pa&s;&s;age in which I expre&s;ly &s;pake of the <HI>impropriety</HI> of a&s;cribing <HI>parts</HI> to God? Speaking of goodne&s;s as an 'e&s;&s;ential attribute' of God; I add, that it is
<Q>no borrowed or precarious excel|lency, as the goodne&s;s of men and angels is in them, but as nece&s;&s;ary as his being. Indeed, one need not &s;cruple to call it a <HI>part</HI> of God him&s;elf, only as there may be an <HI>impropriety in that manner of expre&s;&s;ion concerning the infinite God, in</HI> ALL <HI>other re&s;pects in general</HI></Q>
&mdash;Serm. p. 12. Now, after this, what greater di&s;hone&s;ty or villainy could any <HI>Critic</HI> be guilty of, than you are, in making &s;uch a bu&s;tle as you do, for almo&s;t two pages together, about <HI>parts of God?</HI> And you have the in&s;olence to &s;ay, p. 49. &mdash;'&s;ee what an accurate and con&s;i&s;tent de&s;cription <HI>the Dr. 'gives</HI> of the One only living and true God. q. d.
<Q>God is a <HI>compound</HI> being, made up of eternal, e&s;&s;ential, and equally nece&s;&s;ary, &s;elf-exi&s;tent parts: And tho' the&s;e parts, &amp;c.</Q>
Now, could you have given your readers &s;uch a

If you take the&s;e for <HI>&s;ynonimous terms,</HI> I do not wonder that you think your&s;elf a very ma&s;terly <HI>critic.</HI> &mdash; Thus you father your own non&s;en&s;e and impiety upon me; contrary to my expre&s;s, declared opinion.</P>
<P>The next of your critici&s;ms which I &s;hall take notice of, is this, That I &s;ometimes &s;peak of ju&s;tice as a parti|cular moral attribute of God, di&s;tinct from goodne&s;s; and at other times &s;peak of it as one branch of his e&s;&s;ential goodne&s;s. Your cavils about this, make &s;o great a part of your libel, that there is no occa&s;ion to refer to any particular place. I explained my&s;elf &s;o far, re&s;pecting this matter, that no intelligent, candid per&s;on could mi&s;|take my meaning. For it is evident that when I &s;pake of ju&s;tice in God, as di&s;tinct from goodne&s;s or benevolence in the common re&s;trained &s;en&s;e; I con&s;idered it as no otherwi&s;e di&s;tinct therefrom in him, than it is in a wi&s;e and good man, whether a parent or a prince. It is com|mon to &s;peak of ju&s;tice in man, as a moral virtue di&s;tinct from charity or love, which is frequently &s;poken of as another moral virtue. And yet it is certain that love or charity, con&s;idered in the large&s;t, or mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e of it, includes, not only ju&s;tice, but all other moral and &s;ocial virtues. The apo&s;tle Paul often &s;peaks of charity in this comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e; but mo&s;t expre&s;sly, Rom. XIII.8, 9. A pa&s;&s;age, of which if you had had any tolerable under&s;tanding, you could &s;urely never have cavilled in the manner you have done&mdash;
<Q>Owe no man any thing, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but to love one another. For he that <HI>loveth</HI> another, hath <HI>fulfilled the law.</HI> For this, Thou &s;halt not commit adultery, Thou &s;halt not &s;teal, Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s, Thou &s;halt not covet; and if there be any <HI>other commandment,</HI> it is briefly <HI>comprehended</HI> in this &s;aying, namely, Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf.</Q>
Pray, <HI>learned Sir,</HI> is not doing ju&s;tice often &s;poken of as a particular moral virtue
<PB N="26" REF="009737_0025_0F7A4B4881F5D8A8">
in &s;cripture, as if it were in &s;ome &s;ort di&s;tinct from <HI>loving money,</HI> or from <HI>charity</HI>; and <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI>? And yet does not the apo&s;tle here &s;peak of that commandment, <HI>loving our neighbours as our &s;elves,</HI> as &s;ummarily <HI>comprehending</HI> all the commandments of the &s;econd table? and con&s;e|quently ju&s;tice? And are not chri&s;tian magi&s;trates and parents bound, by that <HI>comprehen&s;ive command</HI> which the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, when under&s;tood in its proper extent, even to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> their &s;ubjects and children re&s;pectively, for the good of tho&s;e that do evil, or for the warning and be|nefit of others? But your narrow, dark and groveling mind can perhaps have no conception of puni&s;hment proceeding from love, or from any thing be&s;ides a &s;pirit of revenge. Not that I by any means exclude the <HI>hatred</HI> of &s;in or vice, as if it had not, or ought not to have any place in him that puni&s;hes it; whether it be God or man&mdash;All the nugatory, flimzy ratiotionations and criti|ci&s;ms which you have adduced, re&s;pecting my &s;ometimes &s;peaking of ju&s;tice as if it were a di&s;tinct moral attribute of God, and at other times of goodne&s;s as if it compre|hended ju&s;tice, and all divine moral attributes, would hold equally good again&s;t the apo&s;tle Paul's account of charity, and its various branches. When once you have enough of wi&s;dom, and of the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, to conceive how <HI>love</HI> is the fulfilling of the law; or how all moral, &s;ocial virtues are &s;ummarily comprehended and enjoined in this &s;aying, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbor as thy &s;elf</HI>; you will no longer be at any lo&s;s to under&s;tand what I mean, when I &s;peak of divine ju&s;tice and divine goodne&s;s in the manner I do; nor be &s;o captious as to object again&s;t it as an inaccuracy or incon&s;i&s;tency. Whe|ther your critici&s;ms upon this head chiefly proceed from ignorance, or from malice and vanity, I will not pretend to determine: But, that there is a great deal of both di&s;|covered therein, is undeniable. And you may if you plea&s;e, in the next place try your critical &s;kill upon the apo&s;tle Paul; and endeavour to &s;hew that he did not under&s;tand him&s;elf, but wrote inaccurately and <HI>incon&s;i&s;tently</HI>&mdash;But I

<P>That you de&s;erve no better a character than this, is farther evident from what you offer page 50, 51. in or|der to &s;hew me guilty of an incon&s;i&s;tency, becau&s;e, tho' I &s;poke of the goodne&s;s of God as infinite, "without mea&s;ure, without bounds;" yet I afterwards &s;poke of it as <HI>directed, controuled</HI> and <HI>regulated</HI> by infinite <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> in all its operations; in oppo&s;ition to its being
<Q>a &s;ort of blind in&s;tinct, or good-nature, detached from rea&s;on and right, or a regard to fitne&s;s and propriety.</Q>
With reference to which you &s;ay,
<Q>What is controuled and regulated, I thought was <HI>bounded</HI> and <HI>limited!</HI></Q>
A great deal of the like <HI>critical</HI> &s;tuff is in the pages afore&s;aid. So that, in your &s;age opinion, if the divine goodne&s;s is di|rected, controuled and limited by infinite wi&s;dom in its operations; and always to be con&s;idered in connexion therewith, in oppo&s;ition to its being a mere <HI>blind in&s;tinct,</HI> it mu&s;t be <HI>bounded</HI> and <HI>limited,</HI> and therefore <HI>finite.</HI> And if you here mean any thing, in oppo&s;ition to me, it mu&s;t be this, that God cannot at once be infinite both in wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s; for if infinite wi&s;dom regulates good|ne&s;s, the latter, &s;ay you, mu&s;t be 'bounded and limited&punc; The &s;ame way of rea&s;oning, or rather of impious trifling, might be applied to the <HI>power</HI> of God.

<P>With the &s;ame <HI>pious</HI> intention doubtle&s;s it is, that you mi&s;quote my words, p. 57. "That the truly great, no|ble and excellent end which a good God has in view," &amp;c.

<Q>Let us &s;ee how the Dr. <HI>reconciles</HI> God's leaving the heathen world to unavoidable and e|ternal mi&s;ery, with his being actually kind and merci|ful to all.</Q>
You then pretend to give my &s;olution of this difficulty; adding with an unmannerly &s;neer&mdash;
<Q>A &s;atisfactory an&s;wer this!</Q>

<Q>This is enough to &s;atisfy &s;ome I trow!</Q>
&mdash;But, you know, I did not allow the truth of the &s;aid &s;uppo&s;ition about the heathen world; nor pretend to &s;hew its con&s;i&s;tency with God's goodne&s;s to all. It was therefore knavi&s;h in you to give &s;uch a re|pre&s;entation of the matter, &s;aving,

This is another infamou&s;ly fal&s;e re|pre&s;entation. What I endeavoured to &s;hew in the pa&s;|&s;age to which you refer, is not how God <HI>became</HI> infinitely wi&s;e or good; but, as it is there expre&s;&s;ed, that
<Q>God being &s;uppo&s;ed all-knowing, independent and almigh|ty, the ab&s;olute perfection of his goodne&s;s <HI>may be de|duced</HI> from hence, &amp;c.</Q>
i. e. clearly <HI>argued</HI> or <HI>inferred.</HI> And I expre&s;ly guarded again&s;t the impious &s;uppo&s;ition, that God is not <HI>eternally</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> good. Now are you, or are you not an impudent &s;landerer, for publi&s;h|ing to the world, that I <HI>pre&s;ume to tell how God</HI> BECAME <HI>infinitely good,</HI> &amp;c. only becau&s;e I &s;hewed an eternal, nece&s;&s;ary <HI>connexion</HI> between omni&s;cience, independency, omnipotence and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI>? Is this criticizing or lying, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland?</HI> For once, let con&s;cience &s;peak.</P>
<P>But I now proceed to take notice of a wonderful <HI>critici&s;m</HI> indeed: I mean one of the mo&s;t impudent, barefac'd and execrable pieces of <HI>forgery</HI> that, I believe, any man ever commited, without being pillor'd or cropp'd, or &s;uffering &s;ome other infamous puni&s;hment; unle&s;s where proof of the fact was wanting, as it is not in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. You have pretended to cite from me, in the mo&s;t formal manner, a long pa&s;&s;age, part of three pages in your libel, not a &s;ingle compleat &s;entence of which is mine. You have, indeed, taken two or three &s;craps of &s;entences from my &s;ermons, here and there, at many pages di&s;tance; fill'd them up with your own non&s;en&s;e and impiety; put all in &s;uch an order as be&s;t &s;uited your <HI>critical</HI> de&s;ign, and palmed the whole upon the world as mine, without the lea&s;t di&s;tinction; I mean as my very words: And all this, in order to &s;hew my <HI>inaccuracies</HI> and <HI>incon&s;i&s;tencies</HI>! For your utter confu&s;ion, I &s;hall now &s;et this piece of wickedne&s;s in folio before your eyes, and the eyes of the world. Page 76 and onwards, you &s;ay thus, <HI>verbatim</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>But I mu&s;t not pa&s;s from this without taking &s;ome notice of the Dr's con&s;i&s;tency, or rather incon&s;i&s;tency: SAYS HE,

ju&s;t turn the &s;cale in favour of an atonement to be made for &s;in, by the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t: And tho' the re&s;ult was, that Chri&s;t was to make an attonement by &s;uffering the penalty of the law at the hands of puni|tive ju&s;tice, yet this mu&s;t be without any kind of reference to divine ju&s;tice, to &s;atisfy that.</Q>
&mdash; O Doctor! can God the Judge all the earth, require an atonement to be made, if he is not offended? And can he be offended, and yet not ju&s;tly offended?</Q>

<P>O Mr. <HI>Cleaveland</HI>! can you read the&s;e la&s;t words of your own, without trembling? Do not your knees &s;mite one again&s;t the other, when you reflect on your own fal&s;ehood and villainy, particularly in the pretended long citation from me, immediately foregoing? All that long pa&s;&s;age, which I have here marked with double commas, is &s;o marked, and &s;tands exactly thus in your libel. It is al&s;o introduced by you in the mo&s;t formal manner, as a quotation from me, with the&s;e words preceding, 'SAYS HE' &mdash; Nor is there the lea&s;t room to doubt, but that you intended your readers, who were unacquainted with me and my &s;ermons, &s;hould believe you had extracted this pa&s;&s;age from them, word for word. Mu&s;t they not nece&s;&s;arily have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o, if they had been &s;o credu|lous as to think you a man of any truth, honor or con|&s;cience? And yet you know in your own con&s;cience, if you have any, that this is a piece of right down forgery; that not one intire &s;entence of all this gallimafry or hotch potch, is mine. Is not the wor&s;t &s;ort of lying and &s;lan|dering, that of writing, and publi&s;hing to the world known fal&s;hoods, injurious to the reputation of another? It is well, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> if you have not, &s;ooner or later, great rea&s;on to wi&s;h, that you had never learnt even to <HI>write</HI>; in which ca&s;e your guilt might probably have been le&s;s than it is. For you could not po&s;&s;ibly have u&s;ed me in &s;o injurious a manner with your tongue, tho' <HI>&s;et on fire of hell,</HI> and <HI>walking thro' the earth,</HI> as you have done by writing and publi&s;hing this libel; which may be di&s;per&s;ed farther abroad than you might have been per|mitted

to ramble in per&s;on, without being taken up, and <HI>receiving your due de&s;erts.</HI> I find, on this occa&s;ion, a great &s;trife in my brea&s;t between indignation again&s;t, and pity for, a per&s;on &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of honor, virtue and re|ligion, as to be capable of &s;uch a piece of wickedne&s;s as this&mdash; Is it not as ea&s;y to prove one man as another guilty of incon&s;i&s;tencies, in your way? &mdash; a <HI>Newton, Locke, Clarke</HI> or <HI>Butler,</HI> as a <HI>Cleaveland!</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of gro&s;s prevarication, and even pro|fanene&s;s in you, I find p. 79, &s;o &s;oon after this. After quoting &s;omething which I had &s;aid concerning the good|ne&s;s of God to his creatures in general, in puni&s;hing wick|ed men hereafter, by way of example and terror; you wickedly wre&s;t my words, as if I had &s;aid, that he would therein be good and merciful even to tho&s;e whom he will <HI>de&s;troy, &s;oul and body in hell.</HI> For thus you expre&s;s your&s;elf&mdash;

I pray God that neither of us may ever know what that puni&s;hment is, by experien|cing the &s;ame in the other world.</Q>
P. 79, 80. Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> you know in your own &s;oul, that you here pervert my words and meaning.

<P><PB N="33" REF="009737_0032_0F7A4B4DC9FB2530">But &s;till you go on to fib egregiou&s;ly for many pages together, in order to &s;hew me incon&s;i&s;tent with my&s;elf.

You there &s;ay,
<Q>The Dr. places in the margin of p. 83 and 84 a pa&s;&s;age of the learned Mr. <HI>Calvin,</HI> con|cerning the reprobate, and &s;ays,</Q>
<Q>That a <HI>certain</HI> decree of reprobation was the known opinion of that learned man</Q>.
The&s;e words are there marked by you with double commas, as if they were mine, tho' they are not. Upon which you immediately go on thus, 'And adds,
<Q>A &s;enti|ment at once un&s;upported by rea&s;on or &s;cripture; nay contrary to both,</Q>
&amp;c. The&s;e words are mine; but you here mi&s;repre&s;ent me, as denying any '<HI>certain</HI> decree of reprobation'. This will appear to any one who con&s;ults the pa&s;&s;age, to which you refer. After quoting Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI>'s words, I ob&s;erved that they naturally import,
<Q>That there are many per&s;ons who, by a &s;uppo&s;ed eternal decree of reprobation, are <HI>ab&s;olutely precluded from the be|nefit of pardon,</HI> or <HI>the grace of God revealed to the world.</HI> This was the known opinion of that learned man: A &s;en|timent, at once un&s;upported by rea&s;on or &s;cripture</Q>,
&amp;c.

You go on to exerci&s;e your talent, and to &s;hew <HI>who&s;e child</HI> you are, in the &s;ame page; where you &s;ay,&mdash; 'The Dr. <HI>&s;tates</HI> the doctrine' (i. e. as you evidently mean, the <HI>Calvini&s;tic</HI> doc|trine of reprobation)

<P>I mu&s;t next rebuke you for your irreverence and pro|fanity in &s;peaking of the great God. p. 101. You there &s;ay,
<Q>Why may'nt the judgment of God&mdash;be a ju&s;t and righteous judgment? The Dr. will not &s;ay, it was the effect of <HI>a &s;adly depraved judgment</HI> in the Almighty!</Q>
I take no notice of the <HI>non&s;en&s;e</HI> of this; (that being &s;o common with you, and your libel &s;o much below criti|ci&s;m): But you are very culpable for your impiety in &s;peaking of the ALMIGHTY in this light, fleering, flouting manner: Shewing a want of due reverence to him, as well as of all decorum and good manners in your treat|ment of me.

<P>Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> your guilt is really great, very great; and it's proper you &s;hould be made &s;en&s;ible of it. What

is the ground of your public quarrel again&s;t me? Does it really amount to any thing more than this? I think divine ju&s;tice is comprehended in divine goodne&s;s, in a way analogous to that in which ju&s;tice, and all other &s;ocial vir|tues are comprehended in the love of our neighbour: you think it is not. I think God forgives the &s;ins of men, thro' the atonement of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e this was wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t; what mo&s;t became a God of infinite wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s: you &s;eem to think otherwi&s;e. I do not think God has decreed to damn men, but for their unrepented &s;ins; neither dare you a&s;&s;ert that he has, tho' you have reviled me with reference to this matter. I do not think it con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice to make infants eternally mi&s;erable, &s;olely on ac|count of the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: you think it is. This is the &s;um of the matter. And do you, can you &s;uppo&s;e my &s;entiments in the&s;e re&s;pects, as expre&s;&s;ed in my &s;er|mons, a &s;ufficient foundation for repre&s;enting me to the world as an enemy to &s;ome of the <HI>mo&s;t important</HI> prin|ciples of the chri&s;tian religion!&mdash;Or can it be a credit to any religion, to repre&s;ent it as <HI>mainly</HI> founded on &s;uch principles as I denied! You reproach chri&s;tianity by doing &s;o, whatever you may imagine.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; if I was erroneous in any of the&s;e re&s;pects; yet how unwarrantable a method have you taken? In your very fir&s;t page, the civil epithets you give me, are, 'bold and dogmatical'&mdash;And are not palpable fal&s;ehoods, mi&s;quo|tations and forgeries, in order to give the world an ill opinion of the principles, and to hurt the reputation of any one, very heinous &s;ins? You and I, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> know very well who has done the&s;e things&mdash;Is not a good name rather to be cho&s;en than great riches? If &s;o, your endeavouring, by repeated fal&s;ehoods proved upon you, and the mo&s;t vile arts, to repre&s;ent me to the world as an impious fool and madman, is certainly a much more hei|nous &s;in, than to have &s;tolen a great trea&s;ure from me, or taken it from me on the high-way. I really think the &s;in you have been guilty of, in writing and publi&s;hing this libel, far greater than either of the&s;e, or to have burnt my hou&s;e, would have been. Nor have I rea&s;on to think, you would refrain from doing me any kind of mi&s;chief

<P>You are the more inexcu&s;eable for this outrageous a&s;&s;ault upon me, becau&s;e of the cautious manner in which I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf as to divine ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s, and the atonement; (which are the chief ground of your quarrel.)

<Q>This I would do, at once with all reverence to God, and with <HI>all due re&s;pect to tho&s;e who have different conceptions of the matter,</HI></Q>
Serm. p. 20. Again, p. 24.
<Q>From whence, I think, (tho' it doth not become a mortal man to &s;peak <HI>confidently</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;es) that it follows, That there is not really in the great and glorious God, any <HI>&s;uch di&s;tinction</HI> betwixt goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice, as has been objected again&s;t.</Q>
Again, referring to the &s;ame point, and to what I had been briefly &s;aying about atonement, it is &s;ubjoined&mdash;
<Q>Tho' by the way, the&s;e things are not &s;aid by me, but with an high veneration for tho&s;e many wi&s;e and excellent men, who either have, or &s;eem to have, different conceptions of this matter.</Q>
p. 65. Was not this peaceable, mode&s;t and candid; tho' you may call it 'bold and dogmatical'? Had I not a right to &s;peak my &s;entiments upon the&s;e points? If you di&s;liked them, could you not content your&s;elf with preaching your own? Or if you mu&s;t needs publi&s;h them; would it not have been more decent and expedient for you to do it, without engaging in a per&s;onal controver&s;y with me?

<P>Moreover: this furious attack appears to have pro|ceeded from <HI>malice prepen&s;e:</HI> it was a deliberate piece of wickedne&s;s.

<P>You are in the opinion of many people, the more in|excu&s;eable in writing and publi&s;hing &s;uch a wicked libel again&s;t me, on account of the <HI>time when it was done</HI> &mdash; when I was engaged in a public controver&s;y of great im|portance to the churches of New-England, as well as to the American heathen, and tho&s;e Briti&s;h colonies which are almo&s;t de&s;titute of the admini&s;tration of God's word, wor&s;hip and &s;acraments: and when I was employing my mean abilities to the utmo&s;t, to &s;erve them&mdash;A work which I was repeatedly &s;olicited to engage in by &s;everal Divines of the fir&s;t reputation among us, &s;ome years before that incident took place, which finally determined me to under|take it.

into your <HI>learned</HI> hands, to have tho&s;e defects &s;upplied: In con&s;equence of which, and &s;ome additional &s;trokes of your own, they appear to the world in &s;uch a wonderful order and method as is ob&s;erved in the libel; it having been previou&s;ly agreed that, as the reward of your pains, you &s;hould have the <HI>whole honour</HI> of being the author of it. &mdash; No &s;mall piece of &s;elf-denial, to be &s;ure, to the &s;aid original draughts-man! This may be all mere conjecture, for any thing that I know; but &s;ome are confident it is not. And one thing that affords ground of &s;u&s;picion, is, that the &s;aid <HI>mode&s;t</HI> per&s;on extols the libel much more highly than it is &s;uppo&s;ed, he would extol any man's performance, <HI>except his own.</HI> Now, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> if you have really been led into &s;uch a <HI>premunire</HI>; if you have been made what the vulgar call a <HI>cat's-paw,</HI> and per&s;uaded to father the <HI>ill-favoured, &s;inful</HI> child which you did not beget, but only fo&s;tered; it may perhaps be mo&s;t for your honor to confe&s;s the truth, and to bring out this whole piece of roguery. And if you &s;hould do &s;o, you may be &s;ure of one advantage on your &s;ide; I mean, that tho' you are not better than you &s;hould be, yet one will, on this occa&s;ion, apply to you the old proverb, <HI>That the</HI> WORST KNAVE <HI>has turned King's evidence.</HI> But at pre&s;ent I mu&s;t take it for grant|ed, that the libel is your's; &s;ince you declare it to be &s;o. It is upon &s;uppo&s;ition that you &s;pake the truth <HI>in this re|&s;pect,</HI> that I have proceeded in the reproof already given you. If I have not handled you very tenderly, or deli|cately, it was only becau&s;e your ca&s;e required &s;ome &s;e|verity: You appear not a little <HI>hardened.</HI> Tho' I abhor fal&s;ehood and villainy, and have been treated &s;o injuriou&s;ly by you; yet I would not have you imagine, that my reproofs proceed from a &s;pirit of malice, or unchri&s;tian <HI>revenge.</HI> According to my principles, you know, cha&s;|tizement &s;hould always have <HI>good</HI> for its propo&s;ed end, either private or public, or both. And altho' that which I have admini&s;tred to you, may and mu&s;t make you <HI>&s;mart</HI> for a while, unle&s;s you are pa&s;t <HI>feeling</HI>; yet, to
<PB N="47" REF="009737_0046_0F7A4B5BF641C158">
convince you and the world, that I charitably intend it for your real benefit, I will now clo&s;e this <HI>epi&s;tle</HI> (which you may po&s;&s;ibly think &s;omewhat <HI>tedious</HI>) with a few friendly and &s;alutary pieces of advice.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I advi&s;e you to humble your&s;elf be|fore almighty God; and to implore his forgivene&s;s thro' that <HI>atonement,</HI> of which you have &s;o wickedly repre&s;ented me as an <HI>injurious a&s;per&s;er.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, I coun&s;el you to acknowledge your &s;in to the world; by publi&s;hing an ample confe&s;&s;ion of the inju&s;tice you have done me, in the news-papers, or otherwi&s;e; and thereby giving me rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction &mdash;It is my pre&s;ent determination never &s;o much as to <HI>read</HI> any thing which you may publi&s;h hereafter, unle&s;s it is written in the <HI>penitential way,</HI> now recommended to you&mdash;After having &s;hewn the world the fal&s;ehood and villainy of your <HI>fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay,</HI> I &s;hall think my own reputa|tion intirely unconcerned in any thing you may hereafter &s;ay of me or my principles&mdash;</P>
<P>Thirdly, I advi&s;e you to be diligent in your &s;tudies, and to take pains in compo&s;ing your &s;ermons; that there may be both u&s;eful matter and method in them;&mdash;in&s;tead of preaching in that fla&s;hy, rambling and incoherent way, that I under&s;tand you do; and for which our other mo|dern <HI>exhorters</HI> have been &s;o famous&mdash;Alas! how much precious time did you mi&s;pend in writing your libel! All which time, the poor people of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> I believe, fared mi&s;erably enough.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Whatever you do, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> beware of mixing <HI>metaphy&s;ics</HI> with your divinity. Your libel &s;hews that your head is almo&s;t turned therewith already; which is the occa&s;ion of my giving you this caution. Preach the plain, indi&s;putable doctrines and duties of the go&s;pel, in a plain, familiar way. Do not exerci&s;e your&s;elf in things <HI>too high for you:</HI> Aim at no great refinements, or very nice di&s;tinctions&punc; Meddle as little as po&s;&s;ible with ab|&s;tru&s;e, controver&s;ial points; for which, I perceive, you have a huge appetite, without a dige&s;tion an&s;werable
<PB N="48" REF="009737_0047_0F7A4B5CB8EBBF30">
thereto. Your head, if not your heart, is already much affected and hurt thereby; and the con&s;equence of your going on in this way, may be right down phrenzy!</P>
<P>Fifthly, Avoid all cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s; all ra&s;h judging and condemning of others, who&s;e religious opinions are differ|ent from yours. Preach your own &s;entiments hone&s;tly; but you &s;hould not repre&s;ent all tho&s;e who di&s;like them, as gracele&s;s, unconverted men; and enemies to the <HI>mo&s;t important</HI> doctrines of chri&s;tianity. A mo&s;t fundamental principle of true <HI>prote&s;tanti&s;m,</HI> (for which you would be thought an advocate) is, that the holy &s;criptures are a &s;ufficient, and the only rule of Chri&s;tian faith; and that all Chri&s;tians have a right to judge of the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture for them&s;elves. In this imperfect &s;tate there will una|voidably be &s;ome con&s;iderable diver&s;ity of opinion, even among wi&s;e and good men; among true Chri&s;tians and true Prote&s;tants; and, perhaps, &s;till more diver&s;ity in their manner of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves upon &s;ome parti|cular points, than in their &s;entiments. You &s;hould not expect to bring all men to think and expre&s;s them&s;elves ju&s;t as you do, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland</HI>; much le&s;s pick a quar|rel with, mi&s;repre&s;ent, abu&s;e and defame them, if they do not. Even <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> differ very con&s;iderably among them&s;elves; as appears particularly by what I cited to you from Dr. <HI>Twi&s;&s;e,</HI> relative to <HI>&s;atisfaction.</HI> Chri&s;tians &s;hould exerci&s;e forbearance and candor towards each other; and Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters (of whom, it &s;eems, you reckon your&s;elf one) ought to &s;et the example.</P>
<P>Nothing is more unbecoming a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, Mr. <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> than a narrow and cen&s;orious, a captious and wrangling di&s;po&s;ition: And they, in whom this evil temper prevails, generally promote it among their hearers; in&s;piring them with antichri&s;tian rage and bitterne&s;s again&s;t their fellow-chri&s;tians, in&s;tead of the meek, benign and charitable &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. I hope you will beware of this bad Spirit for the future.</P>
<P>If you put the&s;e coun&s;els in practice, I am per&s;uaded it will turn to good account;&mdash;much better than for
<PB N="49" REF="009737_0048_0F7A4B5D826F8130">
you to &s;et up as a writer of controver&s;y. It will be more for your own credit, and for the good of your pari&s;hion|ers. I &s;ay the&s;e things with hearty good-will to you and to them; and reque&s;t you at lea&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, before you reject, the coun&s;el. I &s;hould be &s;incerely glad, if by acting a part becoming a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel (for the future) you &s;hould grow in the e&s;teem of the people of your charge; and heartily rejoice to hear that you was &s;erviceable to the cau&s;e of pure and undefiled religion in <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI>;&mdash;to your pre&s;ent comfort, and future honor. I wi&s;h the divine ble&s;&s;ing may attend both my reproofs and coun&s;els, and your labors, &s;o far as both are hone&s;t and laudable, or conformable to the &s;pirit and rules of the go&s;pel: And am, notwith&s;tanding the injuries received from, and the needful rebukes given to you,</P>

<P>IT is hinted in the foregoing Letter, that Mr. <HI>Cleave|land</HI> was formerly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Yale-College, in a way not to his credit. The author has heard this in &s;uch a manner, that he has not the lea&s;t doubt of its truth. But if he &s;hould hereafter find him&s;elf in a mi&s;take with reference hereto, he will give Mr. <HI>Cleaveland</HI> rea&s;onable and <HI>public</HI> &s;atisfaction in that re&s;pect, even without being called upon therefor.</P>
