<P>I HAVE cho&s;en the&s;e words, as they are ana|logous to the la&s;t accents of our departed young brother, C. HAZZARD, and as they equally a&s;&s;i&s;t me with a de&s;irable &s;ubject for my pre&s;ent di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Good</HI> is a term applied, in our text, to con|vey to us &s;ome idea of the underived, &s;elf-exi&s;tent excellence of JEHOVAH; con&s;tituting his infinite ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and forming the never-failing &s;pring of happine&s;s to all in heaven, and to all on earth.

<P>From the&s;e general reflections on the good|ne&s;s of our God, as we are now met to pay our la&s;t tribute of re&s;pect to the memory of the younge&s;t brother in our church, I &s;hall attempt to addre&s;s you&mdash;</P>

<P N="3">III. Illu&s;trate the &s;ubject, by reciting to you &s;ome memoirs of the conver&s;ion and experience of the youth whom God hath removed from us by death.

from pur&s;uing the round of arts; or, from the example of the be&s;t of men; although each of the&s;e is valuable, and highly to be e&s;teemed: Neither do I believe <HI>conver&s;ion</HI> to be effected by the application of any external religious rite whatever; <HI>not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but</HI> OF GOD. John i. 13. Mere civilized nature, is unregenerated nature &s;till. The conver&s;ion of a &s;inner is founded upon the regeneration of the &s;oul by the God of all grace; a work which is perfect in its nature, and never fails to turn the &s;inner out of him&s;elf, from all vain and &s;elf|righteous confidence, to the knowledge and &s;en&s;ible enjoyment of God through the cro&s;s of Je&s;us, i&s;&s;uing in the glory of its Almighty Au|thor. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t from the dead.</HI> 1 Pet. i. 3.

&s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> John iii. 3. The youth who is the &s;ubject of God's converting goodne&s;s, is quickened in his &s;oul; turns from darkne&s;s to light, from the power of &s;atan to the living God: he feels, hears, &s;ees, ta&s;tes, loves objects, the very rever&s;e with which he was conver&s;ant before; and thus he differs from his former &s;elf, in his approach before God, and as he is in his temper and conduct before mankind. It is nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay, that this work of conver&s;ion is not the mending or repairing of old corrupt nature, but is the free gift of <HI>a new heart,</HI> (Ezek. xxxvi. 26.) called <HI>the new man,</HI> (Col. iii. 10.) <HI>the hidden man of the heart,</HI> (1 Peter iii. 4.) and which lives in con&s;tant op|po&s;ition to the corrupt body of &s;in, the fle&s;h lu&s;t|ing again&s;t the &s;pirit; and this ince&s;&s;ant conflict forms the chri&s;tian warfare till death &s;hall for|ever clo&s;e the &s;cene. No man can lay claim to vital chri&s;tianity without knowing &s;omething of this experience; and tho&s;e who really do &s;o una|nimou&s;ly confe&s;s, <HI>We are his workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we &s;hould walk in them.</HI> Eph. ii. 10.

know that what&s;oever God doeth it &s;hall be forever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doth it that men &s;hould fear before him,</HI> (Ecc. iii. 14.) el&s;e it would not be a good work of a good God! <HI>The Lord giveth grace and glory,</HI> (P&s;m. lxxxiv. 11.) and <HI>whom he ju&s;tifieth, them he al&s;o glorifieth.</HI> Rom. viii. 30. Happy youth, in who&s;e brea&s;t God hath begun this good work! Whenever our eyes behold &s;uch, we may, with rapture, exclaim, in the &s;pirit of our text&mdash;<HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever!</HI></P>
<P>That we may be more &s;en&s;ibly impre&s;&s;ed with the goodne&s;s of God in the conver&s;ion of youth, let us&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1.

And a very little acquaintance with human nature will convince us, that <HI>childhood and youth are vanity.</HI> Ecc. xi. 10.

&s;eldom failing to produce extreme &s;or|rows in old age. Suffer me to &s;ay, my young friends, the ca&s;e, more or le&s;s, is your own;&mdash; the&s;e &s;criptures form your picture, drawn by your Creator's hand, whether you perceive your likene&s;s or not. O that God may be gracious to you this day; open your under&s;tanding to know your&s;elves, that you may &s;eek for happi|ne&s;s alone in his pardoning goodne&s;s! Perhaps there never was a period when youths were more di&s;&s;ipated than the pre&s;ent. Look around our city! How many young per&s;ons, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the paths of virtue, roll in luxury, and ru&s;h into every avenue to vice&punc; Though dwarfs in general knowledge, they not only turn their backs with cool indifference upon the public wor&s;hip of God,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been conver&s;ant with the ri&s;ing generation for many years, and in different climes, and I have generally remarked, that a wilful neglect of the <HI>Lord's Day</HI> has been the avenue to unnumbered vices.

Many brought to public ruin, have, to my knowledge, dated their calamities from this evil. What then &s;hall be &s;aid of tho&s;e parents, and ma&s;ters of apprentices, who not only indulge their youth in neg|lecting the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> but &s;et them the fatal example?

like champions in the cau&s;e of infidelity. In &s;uch a &s;tate how many live! and in &s;uch a &s;tate, alas! how many have been cut down by the late pe&s;tilence, as Job expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>while their bones were full of the &s;ins of their youth!</HI> Job xx. 11. That God &s;hould &s;top &s;uch thought|le&s;s youths in their career of &s;in; pluck them as brands from the burning; &s;ave them from going down to the pit of de&s;truction, and crown them with his &s;miles, is certainly an high expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>the riches of his goodne&s;s,</HI> (Rom. ii. 4.) and fails not to make the mo&s;t delightful impre&s;&s;ion upon every pious mind! O how highly honored are &s;ome, who are con|verted to God's glory and &s;ervice in the morn|ing of youth, when the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;es upon &s;o very few, who&s;e grey hairs bend them to the tomb. Some &s;uch in&s;tance of God's converting youth are left on record in the BIBLE, to perpetuate the memorial of God's goodne&s;s, and
<PB N="15" REF="036356_0012_10091E4652CBEB90">
to encourage the tender brea&s;t who pants for the Saviour's love. JOSIAH, born of king Amon, who was a wicked prince, did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, e&s;tabli&s;hed idolatry in I&s;rael, and who&s;e court could by no means be thought favourable to cultivate piety in youth; yet, out of this black &s;ink of corruption God's goodne&s;s draws young <HI>Jo&s;iah.</HI> While in the eighth year of his age, while he was yet young, Jo&s;iah began to &s;eek God; and, in his twelfth year, he &s;o encoun|tered the vile idolatry of his nation, that he broke down their altars, burned their groves, demo|li&s;hed their images, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the wor&s;hip of that gracious God, who had &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed him by his goodne&s;s in early life. 2 Kings xviii. SAUL of TARSUS, a tent maker, yet of a liberal education, received at the feet of Gamaliel, when a young man, was exceedingly mad with rage again&s;t Chri&s;t and his followers; and, to fea&s;t his eyes on dying Stephen, he took charge of the murderer's clothes, while they perpetrated the horrid deed. Acts vii. 58. Yet this young man was not too far off for grace to bring nigh; and of him was formed one of the mo&s;t noble champions in the cau&s;e of God; e&s;teem|ing <HI>all things but dung and dro&s;s for the ex|cellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us his
<PB N="16" REF="036356_0013_10091E4A1E972D40">
Lord.</HI> Such a&s;toni&s;hing changes doth God's converting goodne&s;s produce in the &s;oul of man, whether young or old.</P>
<P N="2">2. By penetrating the brea&s;t of the pious youth, we &s;hall find that rich a&s;&s;emblage of &s;piritual excellence which ennobles the &s;oul, and far her magnifies the exceeding riches of God's goodne&s;s in his conver&s;ion. In conver&s;ion God leaves not the youth as he found him. The goodne&s;s of the Lord is communicative; <HI>my peo|ple &s;hall be &s;atisfied with my goodne&s;s, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Jer. xxxi. 14. The youthful brea&s;t, once the &s;eat of reigning corruption, unbelief, lu&s;t, pride, malice, and every abomination which is offen&s;ive to God, injurious to &s;ociety, and cal|culated to drown the &s;oul in perdition, is now, by the regenerating grace of God, <HI>full of goodne&s;s.</HI> Rom. xv. 14. Faith, truth, hope, love, meek|ne&s;s, joy, peace, benevolence&mdash;every &s;acred fruit he derives from Chri&s;t, worthy of God, beneficial to &s;ociety, and mo&s;t admirably gratifying to his own &s;oul! every &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ing, in its nature and tendency, forming an ab&s;olute contra&s;t to his native depravity! His plea&s;ures are rational, &s;piritual, divine, ennobling the &s;oul, and rai&s;ing it from its &s;inful, fallen &s;tate. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the divine pre&s;ence, as his FATHER; his union
<PB N="17" REF="036356_0014_10091E4C8FBA88F8">
with CHRIST, in the grandeur of his per&s;on, in the completene&s;s of his &s;alvation, and in the trea&s;ures of his grace: the&s;e form the &s;olid ba&s;is on which his happine&s;s is founded, ari&s;ing &s;till higher and &s;ublime, as he advances to the verge of an endle&s;s &s;tate. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this good|ne&s;s prompts his &s;oul in &s;ecret and in public communion with God, in the meditation of his heart, and in the exerci&s;es of his lips. To be|hold the pro&s;perity of ZION creates rapture in his brea&s;t; and to &s;pend one day in her courts, is to him infinitely better than a thou&s;and el&s;e|where. The LAW of his Saviour is more pre|cious to him than an abundance of gold and &s;ilver; regulating his thoughts and actions in every department of life. In his pur&s;uit after KNOWLEDGE, grace ennobles the &s;ubjects of SCIENCE; ince&s;&s;antly enriching his mind with the mo&s;t exalted ideas of the maje&s;ty of God in his works of providence and redemption. Thus, his &s;tudies being <HI>after Chri&s;t,</HI> in&s;tead of the &s;tudent being &s;poiled through philo&s;ophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and after the rudiments of the world, he is rendered more virtuous in him&s;elf, and more beneficial to man|kind. Col. ii. 8. If the &s;entiment of Ovid be ju&s;t, that
<Q>to have learned the liberal arts
<PB N="18" REF="036356_0015_10091E4E12682498">
thoroughly, &s;oftens the manners, and operates as an excellent corrector of ill-nature, envy, and anger,</Q>
we may certainly &s;ay this, and infinitely more, of the converted youth, who, through the goodne&s;s of God, hallows &s;cience at the foot of the cro&s;s! Such, with inconceivable plea&s;ure, may exclaim with Milton&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;How charming I divine philo&s;ophy!</L>
<L>Not har&s;h, and crabbed, as dull fools &s;uppo&s;e,</L>
<L>But mu&s;ical, as is Apollo's lute,</L>
<L>And a perpetual fea&s;t of nectard &s;weets,</L>
<L>Where no crude &s;urfeit reigns.</L></Q></P>
<P N="3">3. The magnanimity of the converted youth to combat the ILLS of life, on principles of vir|tue and honor, is a farther proof of God's good|ne&s;s towards him. According to his years, his juvenile experience may not be very exten&s;ive; yet, he learns &s;omething of human nature from <HI>the plague of his own heart,</HI> (1. Kings viii. 38.)&mdash;more from ob&s;ervations on the calamities of tho&s;e around him&mdash;greater &s;till from the BIBLE, which not only informs him that <HI>man is born to trouble as the &s;parks fly upward,</HI> (Job v. 7) but pre&s;ents him with a general hi&s;|tory of affliction in its variety of &s;ources, proce&s;s and periods, as incident to the righteous and to
<PB N="19" REF="036356_0016_10091E4F980BAF78">
the wicked. This knowledge a&s;&s;i&s;ts the youth to realize the path he may be de&s;igned to tread; and while too many others, ari&s;ing into public life, place their expectations for &s;ucce&s;s on the merit of their parents, the promi&s;es of their friends, or on their own acquirement, he learns, <HI>It is better to tru&s;t in the Lord, then to put any confidence in man.</HI> P&s;m. cxviii. 8. That Saviour who hath delivered his &s;oul from death, he firmly believes will pre&s;erve his feet from falling, that he may walk before God in the light of the living. P&s;m. lvi. 13. And he far|ther concludes, that as God hath graciou&s;ly con|verted his &s;oul unto him&s;elf, and hath promi&s;ed an eternal weight of glory beyond the vale of death, &s;o he will certainly take charge of him through time, &s;upply his wants out of the trea|&s;ures of his goodne&s;s, and make every ill &s;ub|&s;ervient to his real advantage. Rom. viii. 28. From this rational, &s;piritual e&s;timate, he &s;ets off on the arduous journey of life. Happy youth! O that our eyes beheld many &s;uch in this day of vanity! Come, ye youths, fond of tru&s;ting in uncertain riches, and who&s;e confi|dence is placed upon your bo&s;om friends, learn the uncertainty of each, and ta&s;te and &s;ee that the Lord is gracious! Your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions may
<PB N="20" REF="036356_0017_10089634C91D09D0">
fail, your friends may for&s;ake you, your life may fade as &s;udden as <HI>Hazzard</HI>'s, at the very morn|ing of your day. Seek &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s alone in that Saviour who is <HI>a friend that &s;ticketh clo&s;er than a brother</HI>; and who, for your encouragement, hath &s;aid, <HI>tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me.</HI> Prov. viii. 17.</P>
<P N="4">4. The la&s;t in&s;tance I &s;hall name in which the goodne&s;s of God appears in the conver&s;ion of youth, is a capacity and an opportunity to GLORIFY GOD, which is &s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by decrepid age. In early life the memory is re|tentive, the imagination lively, and the animal &s;pirits more vigorous, and le&s;s clogged with cares, than at advanced age; and when the&s;e powers are employed on cele&s;tial objects, they appear in their true lu&s;tre, and i&s;&s;ue in the manife&s;tation of the glory of the Lord! The TRUTH, as it is in Chri&s;t, being deeply laid in the young man's con&s;cience, by <HI>the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">t of truth,</HI> &s;anctifies the mental powers, and forms a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> foundation, on which &s;tands the fabric of profe&s;&s;ion, unifor|mity and u&s;efulne&s;s, and bids defiance to the bla&s;ts of error and temptation, through &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive periods, to old age. This ob&s;ervation, con|firmed in the experience of thou&s;ands, is admi|rably expre&s;&s;ed by David: <HI>O God, thou ha&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="036356_0018_10091E5799865CE0">

Now al&s;o, when I am old and grey-headed, O God, for|&s;ake me not, until I have &s;hewed thy &s;trength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.</HI> P&s;m. lxxi. 17, 18. Timo|thy's knowledge of God and the &s;criptures, from his youth, enabled him to &s;hine as a &s;tar among the Churches of Chri&s;t. 2. Tim. iii. 15. Paul, the converted youth, lived to be <HI>Paul the aged</HI>; (Philem. ix.) and the &s;ervices of his life &s;how the goodne&s;s of God towards him, the opportunities he had of glorifying God, and of being u&s;eful to thou&s;ands. Indulging reflections on the dangers of God's goodne&s;s in the conver|&s;ion of youth, I have frequently thought they were, probably, to ripen the &s;oul for immediate tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion to glory; which has been the ca&s;e with an infinite number of converted youth, be|&s;ides our young brother Hazzard&mdash;Or, a deter|mination to &s;how the all &s;ufficiency of <HI>grace,</HI> in &s;upporting the &s;oul under a long life of &s;uffering, as tho&s;e in the parable of the labourers called at the third hour, bore the heat and burden of the day, and honored their ma&s;ter by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ervices&mdash;Or, that the per&s;on converted in early life &s;hould, from the fountain of his own

experience, be rendered particularly u&s;eful to the ri&s;ing generation; which has been the employ of many whom God hath early called to the de|lightful work of the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Thus, whether we reflect on the conver&s;ion of youth from the corrupt ma&s;s of nature&mdash;the &s;ublime trea&s;ures of grace communicated to his &s;oul&mdash;his boldne&s;s to combat the ills of life&mdash;or his opportunity to honor God and promote the welfare of his fellow creatures,&mdash;in each, in all of them, THE GOODNESS OF GOD &s;hines with admirable lu&s;tre, and demands our mo&s;t exalted prai&s;e!</P>
<P N="2">II. To name tho&s;e PERSONS who are more immediately bound to give thanks for the con|ver&s;ion of youth, was to form the next part of my di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, you will undoubtedly expect me to name their PARENTS. For parents, as the fruit of their own bodies, to deliver a child into the world, whether for good or ill, pro&s;perity or ad|ver&s;ity, honor or di&s;honor, heaven or hell, is of infinitely greater moment than is generally con&s;idered. Sen&s;ible parents, however, look with the mo&s;t tender compa&s;&s;ion upon their chil|dren, believing them to be &s;ubjects of depravity and guilt, <HI>&s;hapen in iniquity,</HI> and <HI>conceived in
<PB N="23" REF="036356_0020_10091E5AA14DD160">
&s;in</HI>; con&s;equently they need pardoning and con|verting grace from the Author of their being, without which their final end cannot be peace: for the Lord, therefore, to meet the children of &s;uch parents, to mark them as his own, and en|rich them with his &s;miles, mu&s;t afford them in|finitely higher plea&s;ures than an ability to be&s;tow upon them the wealth of nations, and calls forth their grateful prai&s;e to God, for the greatne&s;s of his goodne&s;s. <HI>A fooli&s;h &s;on is a grief to his fa|ther, and bitterne&s;s to her that bear him; but who&s;e loveth wi&s;dom, rejoiceth his father.</HI> Prov. xvii. 25. xxix. 3. Such plea&s;ures, the widow of the late Alderman HAZZARD enjoyed, when the Lord converted the &s;oul of her &s;on un|to him&s;elf, and enabled him to choo&s;e the path of truth. This mitigated the &s;orrows of her wi|dowhood, and aided her aged &s;teps down the hill of life; and, probably, &s;he had anticipated her <HI>Charles</HI>'s gentle hand &s;hould wipe away her la&s;t cold tear in death! But, alas! her &s;ky is over|ca&s;t; the prop on which &s;he leaned is now re|moved; her &s;on, in the zenith of his bloom, is arre&s;ted by the putrid hand of pe&s;tilence, and now moulders in the du&s;t! Weep, ye fond pa|rents! weep for her who, having &s;at many a dark year forlorn, now mourns like Nain's widow,

<P>YOUTHS, who are the happy &s;ubjects of God's converting goodne&s;s, are alive to the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame grace they behold conferred upon others, and need little invitation to prai&s;e the Lord. Connections formed in early life are generally la&s;ting, and frequently yield inexpre&s;|&s;ible benefits; but when &s;uch union is founded upon a mutual enjoyment of the love of Chri&s;t, it yields additional &s;weets. The pious youth re|joices to &s;ee <HI>any</HI> enriched with converting grace; but when this favour is be&s;towed upon tho&s;e with whom he walked the paths of education, or to whom he &s;tands related by ties of nature, the&s;e give an higher reli&s;h to chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip,

infinitely more &s;o; for they are, or ought to be, more immediately concerned for the &s;alvation of men, and for the growing empire of the King of Grace. It is confe&s;&s;ed, that the hopes of a na|tion, in a very con&s;iderable degree, are built up|on the ri&s;ing generation; and, in proportion to their virtues and acqui&s;itions, its pro&s;perity is pre&s;erved and increa&s;ed. Infinitely more &s;o, the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t look to converted youth for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of members; nor can they po&s;&s;e&s;s greater evidence of the Lord being in the mid&s;t of them, than by the effu&s;ions of his Spirit upon their &s;ons and their daughters. The&s;e converted youths are hoped to bear the ark of the cau&s;e of God, and to &s;pread the banner of his truth, when our heads recline upon the lap of earth. It was for this that David &s;o patheti|cally addre&s;&s;ed Solomon his &s;on; and Paul &s;o importunately wrote to his beloved Timothy. And for this it is that Zion pleads the fulfil|ment of that mo&s;t ine&s;timable promi&s;e: <HI>In&s;tead of thy fathers &s;hall be thy children, whom thou maye&s;t make princes in all the earth; therefore &s;hall the people prai&s;e thee for ever and ever.</HI> P&s;m. xlv. 16, 17.

pa&s;toral &s;cenes!

Song vii. 13.</P>
<P>If Mini&s;ters and Churches unite in prai&s;ing God for his goodne&s;s in the conver&s;ion of youth, why &s;hould we think ANGELS to be &s;ilent on &s;uch memorable occa&s;ions? The pages of in&s;pi|ration inform us, that <HI>angels de&s;ire to look into the wonders of man's redemption,</HI> (1 Pet. i. 12.) that <HI>they are all mini&s;tering &s;pirits &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter to them who &s;hall be heirs of &s;al|vation,</HI> (Heb. i. 14.) and <HI>that there is joy in the pre&s;ence of the angels of God over one &s;in|ner that repenteth.</HI> Luke xv. 10. I therefore pre&s;ume to believe, that as often as divine good|ne&s;s converts a &s;inner, young or old, the plea&s;|ing event is immediately known in the courts above. Thus, all in heaven, as well as all the redeemed on earth, unite to prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;s in the conver&s;ion of youth! O that this occa&s;ion may be the happy mean, by which God may grant a fre&s;h di&s;play of his mercy, in converting unweary youth, and teach their hearts and lips to bear a part in prai&s;ing redeeming love</P>

forget the convictions I had at times when I went to bed, on reflecting what I had done the day pa&s;t, that I would not be &s;o wicked, and that I would do better on the morrow; for I now began to think there was a God, and I knew I did offend him. My mother often told me there was a God, and the nece&s;&s;ity of his grace; but no &s;ooner was I out with boys, than all was forgotten; and, by the help of the wicked one, I was ru&s;hing head-long to de&s;truction as fa&s;t as time could carry me. At &s;chool, when twelve years old, I would feel the weight of &s;in, and have tho&s;e &s;erious reflections, which pro|duced tears from my eyes; and when the boys a&s;ked me the cau&s;e of my weeping, I would &s;ay, I was &s;ick.

<P>WHEN the Lord was fir&s;t plea&s;ed to illu|minate my mind, I went under great di&s;tre&s;s, whether the Lord would hear my cries and &s;up|plications; for I thought that the Lord had kept me as the apple of his eye &s;o many years, while I had been provoking his mo&s;t holy Maje&s;ty, who, in ju&s;tice to me a &s;inner, might have con|&s;igned me to everla&s;ting mi&s;ery. If he had, it would have been ju&s;t; for I felt my&s;elf con|demned by his law. My mind was &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that I was afraid to approach the throne of grace. I recollected many precious promi&s;es which I had heard and read; &s;uch as, <HI>I love them that love me, and tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me.</HI> Prov. xviii. 7. <HI>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e co&s;t out</HI> John vi. 37. By the&s;e promi&s;es I was led to prayer, and all my heart's de&s;ire was, none but Chri&s;t! none but Chri&s;t! He was all I wanted,
<PB N="37" REF="036356_0032_10091E78865BC308">
that he might clothe me with the wedding gar|ment of his righteou&s;ne&s;s, for I felt I was naked, and could do nothing of my&s;elf without Chri&s;t. After this, the Lord enabled me to &s;ay, <HI>I have found him whom my &s;oul loveth.</HI> Sol. Song ii. 4. This was he for whom I was &s;eeking, and he was to me the pearl of great price!</P>
<P>I once was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, whether I was in the right way of life or no; and it entered my mind, that I had heard people &s;ay, that &s;ome only fancied religion, and profe&s;&s;ed to be chri&s;tians, when they knew no more of its goodne&s;s than a dumb bea&s;t. I thought I al&s;o was only making a profe&s;&s;ion; but, how &s;hould I know it? I went to prayer, &s;elf-examination, and reading the &s;criptures. By the&s;e I found I was in the right way. When I came to con&s;ider a little, I found that it never could be fancy that gave me &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of my guilty con&s;cience, nor in the power of man to make me feel what I did; the Lord it was, and glory be to his name&punc;</P>
<P>By reading the &s;criptures, I found many preci|ous promi&s;es for poor guilty wretches to come to Chri&s;t, and to ca&s;t their burdens at the cro&s;s; for he &s;aid, Matt. xi. 28 and 30. <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden,

and I will give you re&s;t. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and low|ly in heart: and ye &s;hall find re&s;t unto your &s;ouls. For my yoke is ea&s;y, and my burden is light.</HI> I&s;aiah i. 18, 19. gave me great encou|ragement to pre&s;s forward: <HI>Come now, and let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord: though your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be as white as &s;now; though they be red like crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool.</HI> Precious promi&s;e this! It made me rejoice to think, that Chri&s;t gave &s;uch an invitation to &s;inners; and although my &s;ins were of a crim&s;on dye, I was led to &s;ee, that the Lord was able to pardon them, &s;et me free, and give me to enjoy him for ever! One text which gave me encouragement to fly to Chri&s;t for refuge was, Rev. xxii. 17. <HI>The &s;pirit and the bride &s;ay, Come. And let him that heareth &s;ay, Come. And let him that is a thir&s;t, Come. And who&s;oever will, let him take the water of life freely.</HI> This promi&s;e was to me valu|able; for I think that I had &s;uch a de&s;ire for en|joying Chri&s;t, that nothing el&s;e in this world would have &s;ati&s;fied me.</P>
<P>Some time after the&s;e enjoyments, I was brought very low on a bed of &s;ickne&s;s; a mo&s;t

painful di&s;order; but all the pain to me was no|thing, for I felt the privilege of a father to go to. I often &s;aid, the phy&s;ician can do me no good&mdash;none but Chri&s;t! I could &s;ay with Da|vid, <HI>Though I walk through the valley of the &s;hadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.</HI> P&s;m. xxiii. 4. I was much ex|erci&s;ed in prayer; I felt happy in having a Chri&s;t to pray to; I enjoyed &s;uch a nearne&s;s to him, that I often wi&s;hed to be with him; but I &s;aid, not my will, but thine be done. Favoured with a vi&s;it from my tutor in this &s;ickne&s;s, he recom|mended me to read the 12th of I&s;aiah, and &s;e|cond ver&s;e. <HI>Behold God is my &s;alvation, I will tru&s;t, and not be afraid, for the Lord Je|hovah is my &s;trength and my &s;ong, he al&s;o is become my &s;alvation.</HI> The&s;e very words were the de&s;ire of my heart, and were my meditation day and night. I tru&s;ted in him, and he was my &s;trength and my &s;ong. By this &s;ickne&s;s, I was led to &s;ee that the Lord could call me when he plea&s;ed. There was one thing which made me to rejoice; it was, that I had fought the Lord when he called&mdash;not as Felix &s;aid, "Go thy way; when I have a more convenient &s;ea&s;on, I will call for thee." Acts xxiv. 25. If I had

<P>LORD's-DAY: aro&s;e in the morning with the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and was very happy in prayer, earne&s;tly de&s;iring a ble&s;&s;ing upon the day. I found the morning much mixed with the world, and a tempting devil &s;triving to interrupt me. Had &s;ome particular cro&s;&s;es in the world; and my mind was perplexed until afternoon, when the Lord was plea&s;ed to give me a &s;ight of him|&s;elf, as my Saviour, and that he was as able to keep me as he had kept good <HI>king Jo&s;iah,</HI> who was only twelve years old when the Lord en|riched his &s;oul with grace, and made his heart tender and noble in his cau&s;e; trampling under

Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t redeemed me, O Lord, my God! I felt nothing in me but what was contrary to him who loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me; but, of a truth, I de&s;ired to be gathered to my grave in peace. At the &s;upper of the Lord I found much nearne&s;s to him, and could rejoice and ble&s;s him for the rich provi&s;ion he hath provided for his gue&s;t!

<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 18. The morning began with prayer, and ended &s;o, yet with much coldne&s;s. O that I had &s;pent my time better! I would rather be in the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth, than to live &s;o al|ways. I might have heard the word of God; but no, &s;ays &s;atan; no, &s;ays my wicked heart, there is hearing enough&mdash;the weather is cold&mdash; better &s;tay at home. O my &s;oul! where art thou?

<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 4, 1797. Enjoyed more of the pre&s;ence of God the pa&s;t week than I have done for many weeks pa&s;t. How happy is it for a chri&s;tian to feel &s;en&s;ibly the all-&s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t, who has cancelled <HI>all</HI> his guilt! O what a good Sa|viour is he!

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the papers of CHARLES HAZZARD, now read, you who are acquainted with the &s;criptures, and with the power of God in the conver&s;ion of man, are to form your own judg|ment on the reality of his per&s;onal religion, and the hope of his now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing eternal bli&s;s. It is not my province, neither is it my wi&s;h, "to canonize the dead;" yet, from my per&s;onal knowledge of the youth, I pre&s;ume, in chri&s;tian charity, to believe there was hope in his end. It &s;en&s;ibly impre&s;&s;es my brea&s;t, that God &s;hould have pre&s;erved my life, as a &s;hattered tree in the garden of the church &s;o many years, and amid&s;t &s;o many &s;evere &s;torms of affliction, while many youths of grace within the circle of my con|nections, who&s;e branches were covered with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;oms, and who&s;e fruit, in all probability, might have proved a rich benefit to &s;ociety, &s;hould be cut down by death before my eyes! <HI>It is the Lord, let him do what &s;eemeth him good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="036356_0047_10091E9FF1604A10">I feel a &s;ecret joy, that &s;uch of my young friends were pre&s;erved, by the arm of my God, from falling into the &s;trong tide of corruption and error, making &s;hipwreck of faith, and of a good con&s;cience, as thou&s;ands of others have done; but were ble&s;&s;ed with <HI>an abundant en|terance into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>From the &s;atisfaction derived from peru&s;ing the diary of CHARLES HAZZARD, you mu&s;t be convinced of the propriety of tho&s;e who fear God, keeping memorials of his goodne&s;s to them in the &s;everal vici&s;&s;itudes of their journey through life. This is one way, by which, <HI>in the ages to come, God &s;hews the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindne&s;s towards them through Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> Eph. ii. 7. The advantages of this practice are great to our&s;elves and to others. <HI>As in water face an&s;wereth to face, &s;o the heart of man to man.</HI> Prov. xxvii. 19. And, in a diary, reading &s;uch a diver&s;ity of thoughts, temptations, &s;ufferings, hopes, fears, plea&s;ures, pains, expre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e whom we believe to be the &s;ubjects of redeeming mercy, we are led to examine our&s;elves, derive comfort from a &s;imilarity of ca&s;e, and thus, <HI>though faint,

yet pur&s;uing.</HI> Should your lives be prolonged to old age, you will find that &s;uch a Journal will form a volume, in your own e&s;timation, next in value to the Bible; and the peru&s;al of it will enable you, with Mo&s;es, to <HI>remember all the way in which the Lord your God led you in this wilderne&s;s, to prove you.</HI> Deut. viii. 2. I cannot, therefore, too much urge you, who are &s;ubjects of God's goodne&s;s in early life, to copy after your departed young friend, in writ|ing the daily or weekly exerci&s;e of your hearts in your walk with God. The u&s;ual pleas again&s;t it are, a barrenne&s;s of mind, great depravity of heart, many mi&s;carriages in life, little commu|nion with God; and, were you to write, it would di&s;tre&s;s your own mind to read it; and &s;hould it fall into other hands, they mu&s;t needs judge unfavourably of you: but let me tell you, if your hearts are right with God, if you de&s;ire to perfect holine&s;s in his fear, and to walk hum|bly and happily with him, your recording the&s;e evils will tend to humble you in the du&s;t, &s;erve as beacons, or way-marks, to your future con|duct, and lead you to admire the exceeding riches of God's &s;paring, pardoning goodne&s;s to|wards you. If you wait until you are free from

While with you, on the earthly ball, JESUS became my SHEPHERD and my FRIEND; he gathered me from my evil cour&s;e; he bore me on his brea&s;t amid&s;t my greate&s;t foes, and taught me to believe, that when the doors of death &s;hould wide unfold for me, no evil &s;hould I fear; calm and compo&s;ed I &s;hould walk along the vale of death; his rod and &s;taff &s;hould be my &s;tay, and his delightful &s;miles po&s;|&s;e&s;s my &s;oul. P&s;m. xxiii. 4. I proved his word more firm than adamantine rock; his pre&s;ence was my &s;tay; the terrors of gha&s;tly death va|ni&s;hed, and that common foe became my friendly

convoy to my SAVIOUR's arms! Now <HI>I &s;ee</HI> HIM <HI>as he is</HI>; my &s;oul is ab&s;orbed beneath his &s;miles;&mdash;I love&mdash;I prai&s;e&mdash;I adore! Angels a&s;&s;i&s;t my lays. Patriarchs, prophets, apo&s;tles, martyrs; the innumerable multitude of redeemed &s;ouls of every nation, language, kindred and tongue, unite in glorious vi&s;ion, and in endle&s;s prai&s;e to GOD, and the once &s;laughtered Lamb, now in the mid&s;t of his augu&s;t throne, and who makes his glories all their own! May &s;ome at|tending angel on the church below, wing his way, and bear to me the happy news of your conver&s;ion, to the Lord of life! Stand &s;till&mdash; think of me &s;aved from the depths of hell&mdash;think of gha&s;tly death, of heaven, and of endle&s;s woe! Then learn IMMANUEL's power to &s;ave; in|cline your ear to his cele&s;tial voice, which, when it calls in mercy, &s;peaks an heaven of &s;olid bli&s;s into a youthful &s;oul. Then, O then, I'll wait the happy time, when death &s;hall cut your cord of life, and let you fly, to embrace my Saviour and my God; cla&s;p you again to this my glow|ing brea&s;t, to join in plea&s;ure, and in prai&s;e, and to part no more!</P></Q>

<L>NOW, mighty God, thine arm reveal,</L>

<L>We plant and water all in vain,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s thou do&s;t afford</L>
<L>The former and the latter rain,</L>
<L>According to thy word.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Succe&s;s depends on thee alone;</L>

<L>So may this feeble effort prove</L>
<L>Succe&s;sful thro' thy grace,</L>
<L>To turn abandon'd youths to love</L>
<L>Thy name, and &s;eek thy face.</L>

<L>Their minds inform, their hearts engage,</L>

<L>Thy quick'ning Spirit give;</L>
<L>Thy voice alone, Almighty Lord,</L>

<L>With anxious heart and feeble hand</L>
