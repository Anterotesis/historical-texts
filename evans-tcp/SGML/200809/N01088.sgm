<OPENER><SALUTE>Ingenuous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have here a Specimen of the Cloggs &amp; Fetters with which the Liberty of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are intangled at <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Jer&s;ey Governments</HI> beyond any places in Her <HI>Maje&s;ties Dominions;</HI> And when the Conditions, and Impo&s;itions required, are as heavy, and unea&s;y to be bore; and as great a <HI>Scruple of Con&s;cience,</HI> as the grounds of their Separation and Di&s;|&s;ent, it is next to no Liberty at all.</P>
<P>And what the Con&s;equences of &s;uch practices, if per&s;i&s;ted in, will prove to &s;uch a Place, where <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are above twenty to one, for one Church-man, and where men and money are &s;o much wanting, for the defence of <HI>New-York,</HI> both by Sea and Land, which not many years, (by demands of men and money from the Neighbouring Colo|nies on the Continent) was repre&s;ented, as their only Barrier and Frontier, I leave to thinking men, and con&s;idering Politicians to an|&s;wer; be&s;ides the difficulties and di&s;couragements laid in the way of &s;uch as would Import them&s;elves, and the ready and &s;horte&s;t way to promote De&s;erters from tho&s;e Provinces.</P>
<P>I cannot omit a true, and <HI>&s;trange Story,</HI> I lately heard of, that during the Impri&s;onment of the&s;e two <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> either to find out a <HI>Crime,</HI> none being &s;pecifyed in the <HI>Mittimus,</HI> or to aggavate their imaginary fault: An Order was given to Major <HI>Sandford</HI> of <HI>Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> to put &s;un|dry per&s;ons upon Examination, and their Oaths, to di&s;cover what Di&s;|cour&s;e they had with &s;undry of their friends, at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Ja&s;per Crane</HI> in <HI>New-York</HI>-Town in <HI>Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Samuel Melyen,</HI> Mr. <HI>Crane</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd another, gave their Depo&s;itions before Major <HI>Sandford,</HI> but found nothing to their purpo&s;e: Tho the practice is not to be out|done, yea, &s;carce paralelled by <HI>Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition;</HI> for no men are &s;afe in their mo&s;t private Conver&s;ations, if mo&s;t intimate Friends can be compelled upon Oath, to betray one anothers Secrets.

<P>If the <HI>Law</HI> for <HI>Liberty,</HI> my Lord, had directed us to any parti|cular per&s;ons in Authority for Licence, we would readily have ob&s;erv|ed the &s;ame; but we cannot find any directions in &s;aid <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> therefore could not take notice thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P><HI>That Law does not extend to the</HI> American <HI>Plantations, but only to</HI> England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I humbly conceive, it is not a <HI>limited</HI> nor <HI>local</HI> Act, and am well a&s;&s;ured, it extends to other Plantations of the Queens Do|minions, which is evident from <HI>Certificates</HI> from <HI>Courts of Record</HI> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> certifying we have complied with &s;aid Law.</P>

<P>Your Excellency might be at making thereof, but we are well a&s;&s;ured, there is no &s;uch <HI>limiting cau&s;e</HI> therein, as is in <HI>Local Acts,</HI> and de&s;ire the Law may be produced to determine this point.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Attorney.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, it is</HI> Local <HI>my Lord, and producing an Argument for it,</HI> further &s;aid, <HI>that all the</HI> Paenal Laws <HI>were</HI> Local, <HI>and</HI> limited, <HI>and did not extend to the Plantations, and the</HI> Act of Toleration <HI>being made to take off the edge of the</HI> Paenal Laws; <HI>therefore the</HI> Act of Toleration <HI>does not extend to any Plantations?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;ire the Law may be produced; for I am <HI>morally</HI> per&s;wad|ed, there is no <HI>limitation</HI> or <HI>re&s;triction</HI> in the Law to <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Berwick on Tweed;</HI> for it extends to &s;undry Plantations of the Queens Dominions, as <HI>Barbadoes, Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Maryland;</HI> which was evident from the Certificates produced, which we could not have obtained, if the Act of Parliament had not extended to the Plantations.</P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>Makemie</HI> further &s;aid, that he pre&s;umed <HI>New-York</HI> was a part of Her Maje&s;ties Dominions al&s;o; and that &s;undry Mini&s;ters on the

<P>If the Law extends to the Plantations any manner of way, whether by the Queens <HI>Prerogative, Clemency,</HI> or otherwi&s;e, our Certifi|cates were a demon&s;tration we had complied therewith.</P>

<P>We pre&s;ume my Lord, our Certificates do extend as far as the Law extends; for we are directed by the <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> to qualifie our &s;elves in the places where we live, which we have done; and the &s;ame Law directs us to take <HI>Certificates</HI> of our <HI>qualification,</HI> which we have accordingly done; and the&s;e Certificates are not to Certify to &s;uch as behold us taking our Qualification, being performed in the face of the Country, at a publick Court; but our Certificates mu&s;t be to &s;atisfie others abroad in the World, who &s;aw it not, nor heard any thing of it, otherwi&s;e it were needle&s;s. And that Law which obliges us to take a Certificate, mu&s;t allow &s;aid Certificate to have a credit and reputation in Her <HI>Maje&s;ties Dominions,</HI> otherwi&s;e it is to no purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>There is not one word, my Lord, mentioned in any part of the Law, again&s;t <HI>Travelling</HI> or <HI>Strowling Preachers,</HI> as Your Excellency is plea&s;ed to call them, and we are to judge that to be the true end of the Law, which is &s;pecifyed in the <HI>Preamble</HI> thereof, which is for the <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> of <HI>Scrupulous Con&s;ciences,</HI> and <HI>Uniting</HI> the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> in intere&s;t and affection.

There is not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a crime or &s;u&s;picion of a crime alleadged, which is but a &s;lender cau&s;e of Commitment. 4.

<P>The Defendant replied, they could admit of no Copies, &s;eeing there was time enough to have produced the Original; or Mr. Attorney might have compared the Copy with the Original, and might have been able to give his Affidavit to the truth of &s;aid Copy; but perceiving if that Copy was not allowed of, the Queens Attorney would put off the Tryal till another time.</P>

<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As &s;oon as I determined to Preach, leave was asked, tho' not by me; for it was the peoples bu&s;ine&s;s, and not mine, to provide a place for me to Preach in: And I would have been admitted to Preach in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church, but they were affraid of offending Lord <HI>Cornbury;</HI> And Mr. <HI>Anthony Young</HI> went to the Governour, to have his leave, or permi&s;&s;ion for my Preaching in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church; tho' all this was done, without &s;o much as my knowledge: But my Lord oppo&s;ing and denying it, I was under a nece&s;&s;ity of Preaching where I did, in a pri|vate Hou&s;e, tho' in a publick manner with open doors. Mr. Attorney in pleading, fir&s;t read over the Indictment which the Grand Jury found, and endeavoured to prove the &s;everal parts thereof, by giving a large and full account of &s;undry Statutes of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, a&s;&s;erting and e&s;tabli&s;hing the Supremacy of the King over all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons and Affairs, in his Dominion of <HI>England.</HI> And from thence a&s;&s;erted the Queens Supremacy in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, and over Eccle&s;i|a&s;tick per&s;ons; which Supremacy was by a Delegation lodged in his Excellency our Governour, which he is &s;worn to exerci&s;e; and this is &s;ignified to him by Her Maje&s;ties In&s;tructions, which were read in Court. Then he proceeded to produce, and read as much as was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, of tho&s;e Statutes of Qeean <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond, <HI>For Uniformity of Wor&s;hip according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of</HI> England; <HI>and the Paenal Laws again&s;t Conventicles:</HI> And enlar|ging his pleadings on the&s;e points; he turns to the Gentlemen of the Jury, and &s;ays, the matter of fact is plainly confe&s;&s;ed by the Defen|dant, and I have proved it to be repugnant to the Queens In&s;tructions, and &s;undry Acts of Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> Therefore did not doubt, but the Jury would find for the Queen, and again&s;t the Defendant.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ja. Reignere,</HI> Attorney for the Defendant, pleads again&s;t Mr. At|torney for the Queen, as followeth: The Indictment charges three di|&s;tinct and &s;eparate facts as Crimes again&s;t the Defendant.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he, a pretended Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter, endeavouring to &s;ubvert the Queens Supremacy, Juri&s;diction and Authority in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs; did privately and unlawfully Preach and Teach, at <HI>William Jack&s;ons</HI> Hou&s;e, diver&s;e Subjects, privately and unlawfully, to above five in number, without Licence had according to Law, in derogation to the Royal Authority and Prerogative, to the evil example, &amp; <HI>cont. Par.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="001300_0026_0FB27B6645E59CF0">2. That he did a&s;&s;emble diver&s;e unknown, and unvoluntarily, and un|lawfully u&s;e any other Rites and Forms of Wor&s;hip, then are in the Common-Prayer and Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England: Cont. Form. Stat.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That being not qualifyed by Law to Preach and Teach in a Con|gregation or Meeting not allowed by Law, in other manner then ac|cording to the practice of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> at which Meeting were five per&s;ons, or more a&s;&s;embled, <HI>Cont. Form. Stat.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Indictment, <HI>ut &s;upra,</HI> that the Defendant did not Preach privately, nor the per&s;ons a&s;&s;emble privately, <HI>i. e.</HI> with doors lockt, barr'd or bolted; nay, it appears by the Evidence, and agreed to the contrary by Mr. Attorney General: that the people met unlawfully, mu&s;t appear by the violation of &s;ome known Law or Statute, in force here, by which &s;uch Meeting and Preaching is forbidden; that is to &s;ay, the Preaching above five.</P>
<P>I take this Colony, as a Dominion of <HI>England,</HI> to be governed by, and &s;ubject to the&s;e three &s;orts of Laws: 1. The Common Law of <HI>En|gland.</HI> 2. The expre&s;s Statutes mentioning the Plantations, and &s;uch o|ther as are for publick good (as the Chief Ju&s;tice was plea&s;ed to &s;ay in this Court, in the Ca&s;e depending between <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Davis</HI>). 3. By the Laws of this Colony, and tho&s;e are to be as near as may be agreeable to the Laws and Statutes of <HI>England;</HI> and the Judges of this Court (I dare &s;ay) will examine and determine no fact, but accord|ing to the mode and rule of &s;ome of tho&s;e Laws.</P>
<P>That Preaching without Licence, and a&s;&s;embling above five is a Crime at Common Law, I never read, and it is not alleadged to be again&s;t any Statute; it mu&s;t be an offence again&s;t &s;ome Law of this Province, which as yet I never &s;aw, and de&s;ire I may now &s;ee it; and if &s;uch does not appear, then undoubtedly <HI>where there is no Law, there can be no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>As to what is offered by Mr. Attorney, that the Queen, as Supream Head of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> hath power to make Ordinances, and puni&s;h for breach thereof; that this power is delegated to the Gover|nour, who is bound by Oath to Execute them.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing and admitting all this; yet nothing like an Ordinance ap|pears: for the In&s;tructions produced by Mr. Attorney cannot have the force of a Law or Ordinance, e&s;pecially again&s;t per&s;ons to whom they were never communicated; what they may be to tho&s;e to whom they were given, who alone hath the Cu&s;tody of them, and conceals them from publick view.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>William Nicol,</HI> Attorney for the Defendant, pleads in the next place, as followeth.</P>
<P>Mr. Attorney has been entertaining us with &s;ome Hi&s;tory from the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. And it is fit we &s;hould entertain him with &s;ome Hi&s;tory al&s;o, more ancient, and from better Authors, and that is from the Acts of the Apo&s;tles; for we do find, that Teaching, or Preaching, or Speaking in it &s;elf, or by the Common Law, was never found a Crime; for the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> Preached a very new Doctrine to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> which was an ancient Commonwealth, and was not Condem|ned or Impri&s;oned for it, but they were curious to hear again, <HI>Act.</HI> 17. concerning the new Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection; but we find, when the &s;ame Apo&s;tle began to in&s;i&s;t on any Doctrine which tended to in|fringe the gain of the Silver Smiths, who <HI>Act.</HI> 18. made Shrines for
<PB N="25" REF="001300_0029_0FB27B7243090DC8">
<HI>Diana,</HI> the Godde&s;s of the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> they were enraged, and made an uproar again&s;t him, ru&s;hing into the Theatre; but it was no Crime, ei|ther in <HI>Corinth</HI> or <HI>Athens,</HI> where no man was hurt by the Doctrine it &s;elf, neither was ob&s;tructed by, nor any offence to the Civil Govern|ment.</P>
<P>And it is plain, it was no offence at Common Law, but was made &s;o by the old Statutes of 5 <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 5. 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> 4 <HI>Cap.</HI> 15.2 <HI>Hen.</HI> 5. But all the&s;e Statutes being repealed by 1 <HI>El.</HI> 6. and by Act; of <HI>Eliz.</HI> it was &s;till no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but remains as it was, no crime at Common Law.</P>
<P>And the four Statutes again&s;t Conventicles in <HI>Cb.</HI> 2. are all local, and in expre&s;s words, limited to <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> on <HI>Tweed,</HI> &s;o have no relation, to, nor reach to any of the Plantations.</P>
<P>And this is further manife&s;t, from the Con&s;titution of the Plantati|ons, being as it were &s;ettled by National Con&s;ent, for tho&s;e who&s;e thoughts in Religious Affairs could not &s;quare with the Publick E&s;ta|bli&s;hment in Church Government, Di&s;cipline and Ceremonies, as <HI>New-England</HI> for Independants and Presbyterians, <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> and <HI>New-Jer|&s;eys,</HI> and we may add <HI>New-York,</HI> for the &s;everal &s;orts of Di&s;&s;enters in general; <HI>Pen&s;ilvania</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> for Quakers &amp; Papi&s;ts in particular.</P>
<P>And this being the fir&s;t that was pro&s;ecuted in this nature in the Plantations, is made the more remarkable, &s;o long after the news of tho&s;e har&s;h Statutes of <HI>Cb.</HI> 2. have been cut by the Statute of 1. <HI>William</HI> &amp; <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>And it is already evidently proved, that the Acts of A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York;</HI> allow Liberty of Con&s;cience, with freedom of Publick Wor|&s;hip, to all but Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>What was offered on the other &s;ide, by Mr. Attorney, as being again&s;t the Queens Prerogative in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, was foreign, and not at all to the purpo&s;e; for all the Statutes relating to that matter, being to a&s;&s;ert the Queens Empire, and Juri&s;diction over Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons, as well as Lay-men, in oppo&s;ition to the Claim and U&s;urpation of the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> to exempt the Clergy, or Church-men, from the Civil and Secular Power.</P>
<P>And as to the Queens In&s;tructions, they are not, neither can have the force of a Law; be&s;ides that, the&s;e two In&s;tructions produced in Court, are no way again&s;t us, but rather for us.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>David Jami&s;on,</HI> Attorney for the Defendant, appears next to plead in the following manner.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Reignere,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nicol,</HI> Attorneys on the &s;ame &s;ide, having offer|ed &s;o many and large Arguments, have left but little room for new mat|ter to be offered, without enumerating what was offered upon the three heads of the Indictment.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="001300_0030_0FB27B7A05C6A728">As to the fir&s;t, which was Preaching and Teaching without Licence, again&s;t the Queens Supremacy and Prerogative in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs. We did not come here to oppo&s;e, or call in que&s;tion the Queens Pre|rogative or Supremacy: but were willing to pay all due re&s;pect &amp; de|ference thereunto; but we cannot &s;ee, that the&s;e In&s;tructions from the Queen to my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> of which Mr. Attorney has produced a Copy, and which he alleadges to be the Law we have broken by Prea|ching, contrary to the Queens In&s;tructions, which are not a Law to a|ny body el&s;e, but to his Lord&s;hip, who is directed by them, and is ac|countable to the Queen, if he do not ob&s;erve them. Her In&s;tructions are private directions to him&s;elf, and can be no Law to others: Pro|mulgation is that which gives the fini&s;hing &s;troke to a Law. Nor do I &s;ee how his Lord&s;hip &s;hould become guilty of breach of Oath, as Mr. Attorney was plea&s;ed to offer, by not ordering the pro&s;ecution of this Gentleman, for Preaching without his Licence; altho' he be Sworn to obey and ob&s;erve his In&s;tructions, becau&s;e the very In&s;tructions produ|ced, give Liberty of Con&s;cience to Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, and are in two di&s;tinct Paragraphs; the fir&s;t &s;eems to me wholly to agree with our Act of A&s;&s;embly of this Province, is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and very near the &s;ame words; the other Paragraph is negative: <HI>You are not to permit any Mini&s;ter coming from</HI> England, <HI>to Preach in your Government, without a Certificate from the Right Reverend, the Bi&s;hop of</HI> London; <HI>nor any other Mi|ni&s;ter coming from any other Part, or Place, without fir&s;t obtaining leave from you our Governour.</HI> And a Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter Preaching here without the Governours knowledge, could be no breach of his Oath, becau&s;e it was done without his knowledge, and con&s;equently without his per|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To the Second, as to the Statutes of <HI>Eliz.</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> 2. again&s;t Con|venticles, they were limited and local Acts or Statutes, and could not any way reach the&s;e Plantations; for here in <HI>New-York</HI> we have no E|&s;tabli&s;hed Religion for the whole Province. On the Ea&s;t-end of <HI>Na&s;|&s;aw,</HI> or <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> were, and always have been Independant Mini&s;ters, the <HI>French</HI> had their own way and Mini&s;ters, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> in like man|ner; the very <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI> have the free Exerci&s;e of their Reli|gion; and there is not one Form of Wor&s;hip E&s;tabli&s;hed for the whole Province. The 16th. as well as 22 of K. <HI>Charles</HI> 2. are limited to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> and Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Twe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> and therefore the u&s;ing of any other Form of Wor&s;hip in this Province, then what is contained in the Common-Prayer, cannot be a Breach of tho&s;e Statutes. Then again the 16 of <HI>Ch.</HI> 2. for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="27" REF="001300_0031_0FB27B7B98F538A0">
Conventicles, makes the third default Bani&s;hment, for &s;even years into the Plantations (<HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> excepted;) And how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Plantations the places to which the defaulters were to be Bani&s;hed, can be under&s;tood to be comprehended within the mea|ning and penalty of that Statute; that did continue in force, for little more time than four years. The other of the 22<HI>d.</HI> did &s;upply its room, and had much more mild penalties.</P>
<P>As to the third, which is that he Preached without being qualifyed, that is laid again&s;t the Act of Toleration. I did offer, that this Sta|tute likewi&s;e was not, nor is in force in the Plantations generally, e&s;|pecially in this Province, altho' there be no locality expre&s;sly mention|ed therein, and that for the&s;e Rea&s;ons. The title and whole de&s;ign of it is Toleration; now Toleration is an exception from &s;ome re&s;traint; and &s;ince the Paenal Laws are not of force here by con&s;equence, nei|ther is the Act of Toleration of force, here is no E&s;tabli&s;hed Church for the whole Province; from which we &s;hould be tolerated. We have had liberty of Con&s;cience another way, and by an Act of A&s;&s;em|bly, which was made in the beginning of the Reign of K. <HI>William</HI> and Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> during the Government of Col. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> not yet formally re|pealed. Then again con&s;ider the Preamble of the Act of Toleration, to the end that all our Prote&s;tant Subjects, may be united in intere&s;t and affection; the wi&s;dom of the Nation did at that time combine, to put an end to all Per&s;ecution on the &s;core of Religion. Our A&s;&s;embly was much of the &s;ame mind, de&s;igning to prevent it, and &s;o are all good men: when we did &s;et about erecting a Church of <HI>England</HI> Congrega|tion in this Town, and obtained a Charter for the &s;ame, of Governour <HI>Fletcher;</HI> altho' we were de&s;irous to have the National Wor&s;hip among&s;t us, yet was it the care of the&s;e Members, who promoted it, to get &s;uch Clau&s;es in&s;erted in it, as &s;hould &s;ecure the Liberty of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Congregations from our Succe&s;&s;ors; and in an Act of A&s;&s;embly made &s;ince, for its encouragement, the like care and precaution was had; which are &s;till to be &s;een.</P>
<P>This Province has not been much more than forty years in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and is made up chiefly of Foreigners, and Di&s;&s;enters; and Per&s;ecution would not only tend to the di&s;uniting us all, in intere&s;t and affection, but depopulate and weaken our Strength, and di&s;courage all &s;uch Adventurers for the future. Therefore as this Pro&s;ecution is the fir&s;t of this nature or &s;ort, ever was in this Province, &s;o I hope it will be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The Defendant prayed, he might have liberty to &s;peak for him&s;elf,
<PB N="28" REF="001300_0032_0FB27B7E8B0BBE58">
which was granted; and he pleaded in his own defence, the following Arguments, which I publi&s;h in his own words.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am amazed to find Mr. Attorney &s;o much changed in his o|pinion; for when I was before my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> who told us, the Act of Toleration was limited and local, and extended not to the Plantati|ons: And Mr. Attorney being plea&s;ed to confirm it, by a&s;&s;erting the &s;ame thing, and went a little further, by producing an Argument to &s;trengthen his opinion, That the Paenal Laws of <HI>England,</HI> did not ex|tend to the Plantations, and the Act of Toleration was made to take off the edge of the Paenal Laws; Therefore the Toleration does not extend hither; but we find &s;oon after by an Indictment, both the Pae|nal Laws and Toleration reaches hither, and all their penalties too.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Honourable Chief Ju&s;tice, <HI>Roger Mompe&s;&s;on</HI> E&s;qr. interrupted the Defendant, by &s;aying: Gentlemen, <HI>Do not trouble the Court with what di&s;|cour&s;e pa&s;&s;ed between you, before my Lord, or at any other time, but &s;peak to the point.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Honour, I hope to make it appear, it is to the point; and what was Mr. Attorneys argument then, is now mine: For whatever opinion I was of, while an ab&s;olute Stranger to <HI>New-York,</HI> and its Con&s;titution; yet &s;ince I have informed my &s;elf tho|rowly with the Con&s;titution of this place, I am intirely of Mr. Attor|neys opinion, and hope he will be of the &s;ame &s;till.</P>
<P>And as to the Indictment, to return to the particulars thereof; and fir&s;t, I am charged with contemning, and endeavouring to Subvert the Supremacy of the Queen in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs. As to the Queens Supremacy about Eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons and things, we allow and be-believe, She has as large a Supremacy, as in the Word of God is al|lowed to any Chri&s;tian Kings and Princes in the World; and our Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Faith, which will compare with any in the World, and is u|niver&s;ally known to the Chri&s;tian World, is very full in that matter; a part whereof is judged nece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;erted here, for the infor|mation of many.</P>

<P>And in all which Mr. Attorney has offered concerning the Queens Supremacy in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, I cannot learn one argument, or one word, from all the quoted Statutes, that Preaching a Sermon, is the lea&s;t contempt, or overthrow of the Supremacy. And I hope it is not now unknown to any, that the Oath of Supremacy, has been aboli&s;h|ed by a Law, ever &s;ince the Revolution, and con&s;equently the Subject mu&s;t be delivered from &s;ome obligation thereby: and how far this will be con&s;tructed to extend, I leave to the Judges to determine.</P>
<P>And as to my Preaching without Licence fir&s;t obtained from Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> which is a&s;&s;erted to be again&s;t Law; I cannot hear from any Law yet produced, that Ld. <HI>Cornbury</HI> has any power or directions to grant a Licence to any Di&s;&s;enters, or that any of them are under any obligation, to take Licence from his Lord&s;hip, before they Preach, or after Mr Attorney pretends no Law, unle&s;s he concludes the Queens In&s;tructions to be a Law, or have the force of a Law: That they have no force of a Law, has been abundantly proved already; neither am I any way culpable even from the Queens In&s;tructions, which are produ|ced in Court; for they con&s;i&s;ting of two parts, or rather two di&s;tinct In&s;tructions, not relating at all to the &s;ame per&s;ons: <HI>In the fir&s;t,</HI> his Excellency is required to permit a Liberty of Con&s;cience to all per|&s;ons except Papi&s;ts. And this is the Liberty is allowed to Di&s;&s;enters and which we claim, by virtue of this In&s;truction: and here is no Li|cence
<PB N="30" REF="001300_0034_0FB27B8392619100">
mentioned and required; for permi&s;&s;ion is a negative act, and implies no more but this; you &s;hall &s;o allow it, as not to hinder, mo|le&s;t or di&s;quiet them, but rather protect them in it: And Papi&s;ts being particularly expre&s;&s;ed, it cannot be applied to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> therefore Di&s;&s;enters are intended by this In&s;truction, and no other; and if this permi&s;&s;ion is granted us, according to the expre&s;s words thereof, we de&s;ire no more. And it cannot be e&s;teemed by any, that impri&s;oning and puni&s;hing of us at &s;uch a rate, for Preaching one Ser|mon, is a permitting us Liberty of Con&s;cience. <HI>The other</HI> di&s;tinct <HI>Pa|ragraph,</HI> or rather, the other In&s;truction, which tho' joined together in this Copy, are at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from one another in the Ori|ginal; as we really found it &s;o, in a Copy of In&s;tructions to a former Governour: And as the former concerns Di&s;&s;enters, &s;o this is intended for the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> for the words of the In&s;tru|ction, as you have it above, are the&s;e: <HI>You are not to permit any Mini&s;ter coming from</HI> England, <HI>to Preach in your Government, without a Certificate from the Right Reverend, the Bi&s;hop of</HI> London, <HI>nor any other Mini&s;ter coming from any other part or place, without fir&s;t obtaining leave of you, our Governour.</HI> Here is another In&s;truction, which &s;hould not be produced or improved again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters; for all mankind, and tho&s;e of the meane&s;t capacity mu&s;t conclude and determine, that this concerns only the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who by their Con&s;titution, are under &s;trict obliga|tions to take Licence, or Certificate from their Ordinary, and &s;uch as come to the Plantations, acknowledge the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> as &s;uch; and no Di&s;&s;enter, either in <HI>England,</HI> or any where el&s;e in the Queens Dominion, ever took, or ever was under any obligation to take any Licence from the Queens or Kings of <HI>England,</HI> or any other Per&s;on or Per&s;ons what&s;oever; until a method &amp; practice has of late been erect|ed, and forced into practice at <HI>New-York:</HI> For if our Liberty either de|pended on a Licence or Certificate from the Bi&s;hops of <HI>England,</HI> or the Governours of <HI>America,</HI> we &s;hould &s;oon be deprived of our Liberty of Con&s;cience, &s;ecured to us by Law, and repeated Re&s;olutions of our pre|&s;ent Soveraign, and Gracious Queen, inviolably to maintain the Tole|ration which She is plea&s;ed to &s;ignifie in Her Royal In&s;tructions to all Her Governours abroad; which we are the more a&s;&s;ured of, from the In&s;tructions produced in this Court. So that as the fir&s;t clau&s;e of this latter In&s;truction, cannot be applied to any other Mini&s;ters, but of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> &s;o the latter clau&s;e can be under&s;tood of no other but the &s;ame &s;ort, or &s;pecies, as tho&s;e who came from <HI>England</HI> with Certificate from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London:</HI> And it is well known, there are
<PB N="31" REF="001300_0035_0FB27B8499153BF0">
Mini&s;ters of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who may come, and do come not directly from <HI>England,</HI> but from &s;ome other place, as from &s;undry Plan|tations of <HI>America;</HI> as Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> now Chaplain at <HI>Fort-Anne,</HI> came not directly from <HI>England,</HI> but from <HI>Maryland:</HI> And I mu&s;t confe&s;s, he being a Mini&s;ter of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and enjoyes a con&s;iderable Bene|fice thereby, was obliged to comply with the Con&s;titution of his own Church, and take a Licence from Ld. <HI>Cornbury,</HI> if none could be produ|ced from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London.</HI> But all this is foreign to us, and not at all required of any Di&s;&s;enter in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>And if there had been any thing in the&s;e In&s;tructions requiring Di&s;|&s;enters to take any Licence, or empowering Governours of the Planta|tions to grant them, which we do not find; Preaching a Sermon be|fore &s;uch Licence, cannot be judged a Crime, de&s;erving &s;uch a Con|finement and Pro&s;ecution as we have met with; for it has been already made appear, that tho&s;e In&s;truction cannot have the force of a Law, to bind the Subject to Obedience, or render him culpable for Di&s;obedience, &s;eeing Promulgation, which is the Life of the Law, and renders all per|&s;ons inexcu&s;able, never as yet have accompanied the&s;e In&s;tructions: So if this be Mr. Attorneys Law we have broke, by not obtaining Licence before Preaching, I hope, you Gentlemen of the Jury cannot but find, we are no way culpable hereby, being neither incon&s;i&s;tent with the Queens In&s;tructions, and not again&s;t any Law.</P>
<P>And as to the la&s;t part of the Indictment, concerning the Paenal Laws, or the &s;undry Statutes again&s;t Conventicles, they never were de&s;igned, nor intended by our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lators for <HI>America,</HI> or any of the Plan|tations thereof; for they are limited &amp; local Acts, all of them re&s;trict|ed to <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> as is manife&s;t from the expre&s;s words of &s;aid Law; neither have been ever put in execution in any of the Plantations, until now; yea, have not been executed, even in <HI>England, Wales</HI> or <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> for which they were Calcula|ted, and made, the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t: And when they were put in the mo&s;t &s;trict and rigorous Execution in <HI>England,</HI> which was about the la&s;t of the Reign of K. <HI>Ch.</HI> 2. The Di&s;&s;enters of <HI>America</HI> lived very quiet, and even in &s;uch Plantations where the Church of <HI>England</HI> has a full and formal E&s;tabli&s;hment. But which is more, even <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> who are excluded from all benefit of the Act of Toleration in <HI>England;</HI> yet cannot be touched in <HI>America,</HI> by the&s;e Paenal Laws; for it is matter of fact known to all, and I appeal to Mr. <HI>Reignere</HI> if Papi&s;ts have not li|berty, and the exerci&s;e of their Religion, without mole&s;tation from Pae|nal Laws, and even in <HI>Maryland,</HI> where the Church of <HI>England</HI> has a
<PB N="32" REF="001300_0036_0FB27B86CBEBF0E0">
formal e&s;tabli&s;hment by Laws made there: And it is manife&s;tly known, the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Maryland</HI> made a late Act again&s;t <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> and tho' it was never executed, not being approved of by the Queen, yet it is a plain demon&s;tration, if the Paenal Laws of <HI>England</HI> originally and principally de&s;igned again&s;t <HI>Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants</HI> had extended to the Planta|tions, there would have been no need for &s;uch an Act of A&s;&s;embly to be made again&s;t them in <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
<P>It is a further argument the Paenal Laws never did extend to the Plan|tations, becau&s;e it was a penalty in &s;ome of them, that per&s;ons after &s;un|dry and &s;o many convictions, are to be bani&s;hed or tran&s;ported to the <HI>American</HI> Plantations, as places removed beyond, and free from the la&s;h of Paenal Laws; for to what purpo&s;e would their bani&s;hment be, if af|ter a removal from their Native Land, they &s;hould be la&s;hed, or ruin|ed afre&s;h by the &s;ame Paenal Laws.</P>
<P>And if the Penal Laws of <HI>England</HI> do not extend to the&s;e Plantations, where the Church of <HI>England</HI> has a legal and formal E&s;tabli&s;hment, it cannot be imagined, they can take place where there is no particular Per&s;wa&s;ion e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law; and con&s;equently all Per&s;wa&s;ions there are upon an equal bottom of Liberty, as I find to be the Ca&s;e with <HI>New-York,</HI> where there is not one Act of A&s;&s;embly, wherein the name or manner of Wor&s;hip as it is in the Church of <HI>England</HI> is &s;o much as expre&s;&s;ed: And where there is no legal E&s;tabli&s;hment or any penalties or re&s;trictions on the Liberty of any Di&s;&s;enters, there is no room for, or need of any Toleration; for where no penalty, what mu&s;t we be tolerated from; but pure nullities, or nothings, which &s;eems incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the thing it &s;elf: Therefore in <HI>New-York</HI> Government all Per|&s;wa&s;ions there are upon an equal level, and bottom of liberty; and this confirmed to all Di&s;&s;enters, except Papi&s;ts, and allowed by an Act of A&s;&s;embly, already read in open Court. And if <HI>Jews,</HI> who openly bla&s;|pheme the Lord Je&s;us, <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and all other or mo&s;t per|&s;wa&s;ions are allowed even in this Government; it is matter of wonder, and I can know no rea&s;on, why we only &s;hould not be allowed of, but put to mole&s;tation as we now are, by my pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution: Is it be|cau&s;e we are Prote&s;tants? Is it becau&s;e we are like&s;t the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church of <HI>England</HI> of any Di&s;&s;enters? Is it becau&s;e we are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Body of Prote&s;tants in the Queens Dominions? Is it be|cau&s;e we have now &s;ince the Union, a National E&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as nighly related and annexed unto the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> as the Church of <HI>England</HI> them&s;elves? Sure &s;uch Proceedings, when known, will and mu&s;t be a prodigy to <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="33" REF="001300_0037_0FB27B8845062DB8">Mr. Attorney replied, it was impo&s;&s;ible for any man to an&s;wer all which was offered, there was &s;o much delivered, and by &s;o many.</P>
<P>The Defendant told Mr. Attorney, he verily believed it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for Mr. Attorney to an&s;wer what was &s;aid, and that it was a great truth Mr. Attorney a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>Mr. Attorney proceeds to an&s;wer, and &s;ays: The&s;e Gentlemen on the other &s;ide a&s;&s;ert all the Paenal Laws of <HI>England</HI> are local &amp; limited to <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed;</HI> but I &s;hall produce one that is not &s;o, but extends to all the Queens Dominions; and that is the Act of Uniformity, made the fir&s;t of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which is demon&s;trated from the very words of &s;aid Law, <HI>or other place within this Realm of England, Wales, and the Marches of the &s;ame,</HI> and <HI>other the QUEENS Dominions:</HI> And flies to the In&s;tructions again, and endeavours to a&s;|&s;ert and vindicate the Supremacy, and &s;ays, the Kings and Queens of <HI>England,</HI> Enjoin and Command their Governours to grant Licences; and it has always been cu&s;tomary, and an univer&s;al practice to take Li|cences from Governours: And tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who come from other places, mu&s;t be the &s;ame that my Ld. is to allow Liberty of Con&s;ci|ence unto.</P>
<P>The Defendant begged leave to an&s;wer the Attorney as to his la&s;t Argument, as to the fir&s;t of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which is the Act of Uniformity; we acknowledge it was exten&s;ive to the Queens Dominions in general, and not limited to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> only; yet I hope to make it ap|pear, this Act does no way affect the Plantations, and far le&s;s affect Di&s;|&s;enters; therfore is altogether foreign to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. For 1. That Act of Parliament was made in the fir&s;t year of the Reign of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and con&s;equently before any Plantation had a being, or was thought of, and &s;o could have no relation to them at all, they being pure non-entities at that time. 2. All over the Act, and in &s;undry pla|ces thereof, it is directed to Mini&s;ters, Par&s;ons or Vicars in Cathedrals, Pari&s;h-Churches, Private Chappels, or Oratories; and not a word in the whole Act of Di&s;&s;enters or Conventicles. For 3. At that time, when this Act was made, there were not &s;trictly and properly &s;peaking, any number of Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> who held Separate Meetings from the Publick and E&s;tabli&s;hed Wor&s;hip; for tho' there were tho&s;e in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who always from the beginning of the Reformation &s;crupled the u&s;e of all the Common Prayer, and omitted &s;ome Cere|monies, which was, and is to this day, the grounds of the Separation; and it was to oblige &s;uch to an Uniformity in Publick Wor&s;hip. And as &s;oon as the Act was made, and put in Execution, with all its penalties,
<PB N="34" REF="001300_0038_0FB27B89C6C3CFC0">
many were di&s;couraged, others Ca&s;t out of the Church, for Noncon|formity; and this really made the Separation, and all the mi&s;chiefs of the Separation are originally owing to this Act; tho' as &s;oon as the Se|paration was made, they could not touch Di&s;&s;enters by the penalties of this Act, therefore were under a nece&s;&s;ity of making new Acts of Parlia|ment in the following Reigns, for puni&s;hing Separated Di&s;&s;enters; all which were limited and local in expre&s;s words; and never de&s;igned to pur&s;ue Per&s;ecuted Per&s;ons to an <HI>American</HI> Wilderne&s;s. 4. I am able to make it appear, if this Act of Uniformity were &s;trictly put in Executi|on, the mo&s;t of the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> would fall un|der its la&s;hes and penalties; for none of them are to u&s;e any other Rite, Ceremony, or open Prayer, but what is mentioned and &s;et forth, in the &s;aid Book of Common-Prayer. And it is well known, the mo&s;t valuable men in that Church u&s;e another Publick Prayer, then is in Common Prayer, and all &s;uch per&s;ons are &s;o far Di&s;&s;enters, and being in Communion with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> are only liable to be Pro&s;ecuted upon this Statute.</P>
<P>And as to the Queens In&s;tructions, which Mr. Attorney in&s;i&s;ts &s;o much upon, it was, and is obvious to every man, they were two di&s;tinct In|&s;tructions; and tho' we have them placed &s;o near in this Copy, they have no affinity one to another; and it is not fair for Mr. Attorney to take the latter clau&s;e of one In&s;truction, and join it to another, which was before; this is a Curtailing the Queens In&s;tructions: whereas tho&s;e who compo&s;ed them, knew better how to join them together, then Mr. Attorney does.</P>
<P>And whereas Mr. Attorney affirms, that giving and taking Licence was very common and univer&s;al; I am well a&s;&s;ured there never was, neither is to this day any &s;uch practice in any Plantation of <HI>America;</HI> and there were but few per&s;ons, as yet in <HI>York</HI> Government that had Li|cences; for be&s;ides the two <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters, who differ upon <HI>Long-I|&s;land,</HI> and it is &s;aid Licences are the cau&s;e of their difference; there is but one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nonconformi&s;t Mini&s;ter, in all the Government, who has taken a Licence, and it is as certain, Mr. <HI>Dubois,</HI> and &s;undry others of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Churches has no Licence, neither will &s;ubmit to any &s;uch as are granted.</P>
<P>Mr. Attorney perceiving how matters then &s;tood, moves that the Ju|ry &s;hould bring in a &s;pecial Verdict, and the Judges inclined thereunto; for &s;ays Mr. Attorney, the matter of fact is plainly confe&s;&s;ed by the De|fendant, as you have heard, and you are to bring it in &s;pecially, for you are not Judges of Law.</P>

<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Ca&s;e is very different; for it is the opinion and con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that notwith&s;tanding their Ordination, they are not to Preach or Officiate as Mini&s;ters, until they procure, or have a Licence from their Bi&s;hop, or Ordinary, which no Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter is concerned with; and they voluntarily and freely bring them&s;elves under an Oath of Canonical Obedience, to obey their Ordinary; and if he require them to take Licences, or any thing el&s;e they mu&s;t, they are &s;worn to &s;ubmit thereunto.

<P>The Jury de&s;ired the Act of A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> might be delivered to them; and the Defendant de&s;ired the Jury might have the Queens In&s;tructions al&s;o, which Mr. Attorney oppo&s;ed and denied.</P>
<P>There is a Con&s;table Sworn to attend the Jury, who withdraws, and in a very &s;hort time returned again.</P>
<P>The Jury is called, and finds the Defendant Not Guilty.</P>
<P>The Court begun to enquire Rea&s;ons for the Jury's Verdict, but the Chief Ju&s;tice told the Jury, they might give Rea&s;ons if they would, &amp; they might choo&s;e whether they would or not give any Rea&s;ons for their Verdict. The Foreman told the Court, the Defendant had not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed any Law: Another per&s;on of the Jury told the Court, they believed in their Con&s;ciences, they had done the Defendant Ju&s;tice, &amp; &s;o the Verdict was confirmed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Reign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> Attorney for the Defendant, moved, that the Defendant might be di&s;charged; which was by the Chief Ju&s;tice referred till to morrow morning.</P>

<P>The Defendant told the Court, it was an hard ca&s;e, that an innocent per&s;on, and one found &s;o upon Tryal, and by Law, and &s;uffering &s;o much already, and not only innocently, but for doing of good, &s;hould pay &s;o &s;evere Fees at la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="001300_0041_0FB27B9AAD3889C0">At length the Defendant was willing to pay all ju&s;t and legal Fees to the Court, and Officers thereof, who acted indifferently in their &s;everal Offices, as to this matter, but it was unrea&s;onable, he &s;hould pay his Pro|&s;ecutors, what&s;oever they were plea&s;ed to demand; this was nothing le&s;s, then hiring our Enemies to ruin us; but it being the practice, as they affirmed, no Arguments would be received.</P>
<P>The Defendant further told the Court, if he mu&s;t pay Fees, as he was a Stranger, prayed he might not be left to the Arbitrary Demands of Officers; but that the Bill of Co&s;t might be produced, and examined in open Court, and taxed by the Judges. But the Chief Ju&s;tice decl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ning it, as a thing he did not concern him&s;elf with: It was referred to <HI>Robert Millward</HI> E&s;qr. one of the A&s;&s;i&s;tant Judges, who was to tax the Bill, after notice given to the Defendant or his Attorney, of the time &amp; place to make their objections: But the Bill was taxed by &s;aid Judge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> without any &s;uch notice given; and in&s;tead of moderating any Arti|cles, added two new ones. And their full account was paid, and a Co|py of &s;aid Account denied the Defendant, and a Receipt upon payment of Money refu&s;ed, tho' paid in pre&s;ence of two Witne&s;&s;es.</P>

So this is to enlighten, not only tho&s;e abroad in the World, but al&s;o influence and direct the A&s;&s;emblys of <HI>New-York</HI> for the future; in not giving a handle to any, to pervert their Laws, contrary to the intention of the Legi&s;lators, for confirming by &s;ub&s;equent Acts, in their unju&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; all which they may perceive from the following particu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1. This Law is no general for the whole Government, but for four Counties of a Colony where there are nine Counties; &s;o that the large&s;t &s;hare is yet without the benefits of this Act. 2. It was made upon the motion and appli|cation of &s;undry Di&s;&s;enters, on <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> yet alive, who expected a|nother benefit by it, then they have been &s;ince treated with. 3.

There is not any mention of &s;o much as the name of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or the mode or manner of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Wor&s;hip, Government or Ceremonies in all the Law, without which, I cannot imagine they can have any E&s;tabli&s;hment. 5. Every &s;ufficient Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter, duly called according to directions of &s;aid Law, has a right hereunto, and none el&s;e, and that Di&s;&s;enters for whom this Law was originally de|&s;igned, are deemed and called Mini&s;ters, and men in Holy Orders, is plain from the expre&s;s words of the Act of Toleration. 6. None have a right unto, or &s;hould have any benefit by this Act, but he that is cal|led and cho&s;en by twelve men, cho&s;en by the free Votes of the people of the County which Mr. <HI>Urqhart</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> never had by any Vote of the majority; therefore has as great a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight to the Salary there, as he has to the Meeting-Hou&s;e, with the Hou&s;e &amp; Land he lives upon, of which the Proprietors have been Ou&s;ted with violence, without all legal Proce&s;s or Ejectment; and being of 1500 <HI>l.</HI> value. It is matter of &s;ati|faction this practice is &s;ingular, and not yet made a Pre&s;ident of, tho' <HI>New-Town</HI> is threatened by the &s;ame Par&s;on. 7.

<P>The next thing to be taken notice of in this Po&s;t&s;cript, is a Copy of Mr. <HI>Makemies</HI> Certificate from a Court of Record in the Dominion of <HI>Virginia;</HI> which was produced to, and read by Ld. <HI>Cornbury,</HI> before Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment, and &s;hown to the Grand Jury, before the Pre&s;entment was found: And tho' Mr. Attorney told the &s;aid Jury, while four of the Hearers were examining upon Oath concerning the Sermon, this
<PB N="45" REF="001300_0049_0FB27BAC2D4591B0">
Certificate was writ under a Hedge, which no doubt influenced them to have no regard thereunto: Yet if the Act of Toleration, and con&s;e|quently this Certificate had come in play at the Tryal, he was armed with an Exemplification from the Government, &s;igned by the Prae&s;ident, and the Seal of the Colony annext, to prove the truth and validity of this Certificate, and vindicate it from Forgery.</P>
<P>The la&s;t thing is an account of the Expences, of not only a per&s;on who is innocent, but for doing good, as was determined by the Tryal; and in complying with the mo&s;t &s;olemn obligations of duty, both to God, and the Souls of men. To which, be&s;ides lo&s;s of time, and ab|&s;ence from his Family and Concerns, he might have ju&s;tly charged <HI>Twelve Pounds</HI> more Money, by being nece&s;&s;iated to make his E&s;cape, both by Land and Water to <HI>New-England,</HI> from Office with new Pre|cepts, whereby a whole Sabbath was prophaned, in &s;eeking to appre|hend him; for which &s;ome mu&s;t be accountable.</P>
<P>But it is plain and undeniable, that the Pro&s;ecution of the mo&s;t in|nocent per&s;on in the world at <HI>New-York</HI> is more expen&s;ive, then if Mr. <HI>Makemie</HI> had been guilty of all the Paenal Laws mu&s;tered up, in the In|dictment again&s;t one Sermon, if pro&s;ecuted in <HI>England,</HI> even while P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+nal Laws were in force, and Executed there.</P>
<P>And a fair and legal deci&s;ion, cannot put an end to a Controver&s;y where the &s;ame fact is made criminal, and a new Proce&s;s violently de|&s;igned, and vigorou&s;ly aimed at, by &s;uch, as nothing but the interpo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on of the Authority of <HI>England</HI> will put a &s;top to.</P>
<P>And what legal Authority Mr. Attorney, and a perpetual Sheriff have for their demanded Fees, I leave to the Regulated.
