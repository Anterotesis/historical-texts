<HEAD>AN ADDRESS To the Principal INHABITANTS of the BRITISH NORTH-AMERICAN Colonies. On Occa&s;ion of the PEACE.</HEAD>
<P>SIRS, As the long-de&s;ired Time is at length arrived, when the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace are happily re&s;tored, and his Maje&s;ty's American Dominions inlarged and &s;ecu|red; give me leave (&s;o far as relates to my particular Pro|fe&s;&s;ion) to lay before you &s;ome Ob&s;ervations, which may tend to the continued Security of the Colonies which you inhabit; as well as to the proper Improvement and Progre&s;s of true Chri&s;tianity, in the &s;everal Di&s;tricts of Briti&s;h America.</P>
<P>The general Truths, relative to the&s;e important Subjects, are delivered in the following Di&s;cour&s;e. The Ob&s;erva|tions which I beg Leave to offer in this Addre&s;s, are &s;uch as more particularly relate to your&s;elves. And as you are the fir&s;t great Barrier, on which your Mother-Country mu&s;t de|pend for the Security of her Colonies, every Con&s;ideration which can add new Motives to your well-directed Zeal, though they more immediately affect Your&s;elves, yet in the End they mu&s;t touch the Intere&s;ts of our common Country.</P>
<P>As true Chri&s;tianity cannot be either propagated or e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, but on the Principles of Chri&s;tian Liberty; let me fir&s;t, with all due Re&s;pect and Freedom lay before you the peculiar Rea&s;ons, on which You, above all the Inhabitants of the Earth, ought to be zealous in e&s;tabli&s;hing the gene|rous Principles of religious Freedom.</P>
<P>In the following Di&s;cour&s;e you will &s;ee a general Sketch of the gradual Decline of religious Liberty, from that Per|fection which it ju&s;tly boa&s;ted in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tiani|ty. This Decline ended in it's total Extinction; which was in Time followed by its imperfect Revival, in the Days of LUTHER. In Europe, the Con&s;equence of the&s;e Events hath been, that the &s;everal Sects of Chri&s;tians di&s;&s;enting from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion of their re&s;pective Countries, aro&s;e in &s;mall Numbers of Men: Hence, although mutual Di&s;like hath been too general among the &s;everal Denomi|nations of Chri&s;tians; yet the na&s;cent Sects have been but &s;eldom of Force to controul the leading Spirit of the nati|onal Religion; which hath generally been of Power to
<PB N="iv" REF="009356_0003_103214D4B7306B00">
overbear them by its legal E&s;tabli&s;hment. Thus, both the public Peace, and many good Effects of Religion (though even in &s;ome Degree intolerant) have been in Part main|tained, though the true Spirit of religious Freedom hath been but little attended to. The Religion of the Country though imperfect, hath &s;till been able to co-operate with the Wi&s;dom of the State; and hence, at lea&s;t a can&s;i&s;tent Sy&s;tem of Policy hath ari&s;en.</P>
<P>But on the Continent of Briti&s;h AMERICA, the Matter hath been quite otherwi&s;e. For here, the &s;everal Colonies, though united under one common King and Country, were from their very fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment inhabited by Chri&s;tians of various Denominations, divided in Principle and Opinion; &s;ome of them driven from their Country by this very Want of Religious Freedom; and all of them but too much taint|ed with the &s;ame intolerant Spirit which they &s;o ju&s;tly con|demned in others; on an Equality with Re&s;pect to Proper|ty and Power; and too generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, I fear, with &s;uch a mutual Di&s;like and Jealou&s;y, as mu&s;t ever retard many pub|lic Mea&s;ures which may re&s;pect the common Good of All; unle&s;s the genuine Spirit of Chri&s;tian Liberty &s;hall at length unite them in the perfect Bonds of Charity and mutual Love. Hence, then, ari&s;es a peculiar Argument, on which the In|habitants of the American Colonies &s;hould zealou&s;ly adopt the generous Principles of Religious Freedom; becau&s;e that uncharitable Di&s;union and Di&s;like, which, in the European Countries, may not affect the public Mea&s;ures, mu&s;t inevi|tably, in the American Colonies, where the contending reli|gious Intere&s;ts are nearly equal, be attended with Con&s;e|quences which are bad; may po&s;&s;ibly be attended with Con&s;equences that are fatal.</P>
<P>Hence then ari&s;es a powerful Argument for your putting on the Spirit of Moderation, and the Adoption of religious Liberty; without which, even the temporal Intere&s;ts of the Colonies mu&s;t be often ob&s;tructed; without which, the di&s;|tant and out-lying Parts of the Briti&s;h Settlements mu&s;t be doomed to live in Ignorance and Error; and without which the native Indians mu&s;t either continue in their pre&s;ent de|plorable State of Idolatry, Cruelty and Vice; or mu&s;t be|come your mo&s;t dangerous Enemies, by the Adoption of the Principles of Popery.</P>
<P>And this naturally leads me to lay before you the pecu|liar Circum&s;tances which attend your Situation with re&s;pect to the Popi&s;h Settlements which lie contiguous to the Pro|te&s;tant
<PB N="v" REF="009356_0004_103214D63A9A4220">
ones; and to point out the Dangers that may and mu&s;t ari&s;e from that Quarter, unle&s;s a true Spirit of Chri&s;|tian Liberty and Zeal unite and animate you to the effectual Civilization and Conver&s;ion of your native Indian Allies.</P>
<P>And here, you will fir&s;t pardon me, if I ob&s;erve, that though a narrow, intolerant, and per&s;ecuting Spirit hath too frequently been found among the &s;everal Prote&s;tant Churches; yet this fal&s;e Zeal is not attended with the &s;ame Eagerne&s;s for the Conver&s;ion of others, as is found in the Roman Church. The Rea&s;on of this Difference lies here: That the Principle of Intolerance and Per&s;ecution ari&s;es in the Church of Rome from a con&s;i&s;tent Principle and Be|lief, that there is no Salvation beyond the Pale of their Communion. This Principle no Prote&s;tant holds: and therefore the fal&s;e Zeal of a per&s;ecuting or intolerant Pro|te&s;tant hath not the &s;ame Foundation, nor is therefore at|tended with the &s;ame &s;teady Con&s;equences, with that which is built on the Popi&s;h Faith. The per&s;ecuting Zeal of the Papi&s;t is founded in Principle; and therefore urges on to Conver&s;ion from a Motive of Charity: The per&s;e|cuting Zeal of a Prote&s;tant is only founded in Pa&s;&s;ion; and therefore goes no farther than as it is urged by the Motive of Di&s;like<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As this may be thought not altogether con&s;i&s;tant with what is &s;aid in p. 15 of the following Di&s;cour&s;e; it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that the Principle of Per&s;ecution there mentioned, is called "the &s;ame" with that of Popery, with Re&s;pect to &s;uch Con&s;equences only as ari&s;e from Di&s;like.</NOTE> Hence the Popi&s;h Colonies will always out-do the Prote&s;tant, in the Conver&s;ion of Idolators; unle&s;s the&s;e la&s;t be &s;trongly united by the Principles of Chri&s;tian Liberty, and animated by a generous Zeal for the real Welfare of Mankind.</P>
<P>In Support of the&s;e Truths, I have formerly appealed to the State of Popery and Prote&s;tanti&s;m on the Continent of America. <Q>There the different Genius of the&s;e two Sy&s;|tems operates with Univer&s;ality and Power. The Pa|pi&s;ts are zealous, watchful and a&s;&s;iduous; the Prote&s;tants are cold, indifferent and neglectful. The Spaniards, in Cour&s;e of Time, will have converted one half of the va&s;t &s;outhern Continent, and murdered the other. The French joyn Policy to Zeal; or rather, make Zeal &s;ub|&s;ervient to Policy. They rea&s;on, they per&s;uade, they cajole, they terrify the poor Indian Nations; and by every Means of Truth and Fal&s;ehood, draw them over to their Party. The Conduct of the Engli&s;h is the Re|ver&s;e
<PB N="vi" REF="009356_0005_103214D835BF79C8">
of all this. Doubtle&s;s, many of our Mi&s;&s;ionaries are worthy Men: But it mu&s;t be acknowledged, as the na|tural Effect and Defect of the Prote&s;tant Sy&s;tem, that they are not generally impelled by Zeal, but compelled by Nece&s;&s;ity, to vi&s;it the&s;e remote and inho&s;pitable Regi|ons. In the mean Time, the Inhabitants of our Colo|nies are, like our&s;elves, too generally given up to Views of Gain and Plea&s;ure: Thus Popery advances with dread|ful Strides, while Prote&s;tanti&s;m lies immer&s;ed in Indo|lence and Sleep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;timate, &amp;c. Vol. II. p. 143.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Le&s;t this &s;hould be regarded as an aggravated Repre&s;en|tation; give me leave to &s;ubjoin a &s;trong Confirmation of the whole, contained in a Letter from an Officer in North-America, directed to Mr. Davis, Book&s;eller, in Holbourne; and dated December 1758.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I Have read two Volumes, intituled, an E&s;timate of the Manners and Principles of the Times; and as I think I have received Improvement by them. I offer the Author my grateful Acknowledgments. But this is not the chief Motive which leads me to trouble you with this Letter. In Vol. II. Part II. Section 4. this Writer &s;eems to me to have developed this Subject with &s;o much Pene|tration, and &s;ound Rea&s;oning, and thrown &s;o alarming a Light upon it, that if it has not, or &s;hould not rou&s;e the Attention of his Countrymen in general, and of tho&s;e in particular who &s;uperintend the public Welfare, it will be a melancholy Demon&s;tration, that he hath not coloured his Picture up to the Life. As my Ab&s;ence from my native Country for &s;ome Years has deprived me of the Opportu|nity of knowing many Facts this Writer a&s;&s;erts, though from a Credibility of his Evidence, and a Variety of Cir|cum&s;tances, my Faith is not a wavering one; &s;o my Re&s;i|dence and Situation in this Part of the World hath enabled me to &s;trengthen the Proof of his Subject in the above Sec|tion; I mean with regard to the Growth and Influence of Popery over the North American Indians: and it is the Know|ledge of this Fact, and the very important Con&s;equences of it, which prevailed upon me to offer to this excellent Author, additional Evidence to the Truth and Weight of his Rea&s;oning. Throughout North America the Engli&s;h have but one Chapel, and but one Mi&s;&s;ionary among&s;t the Indians. The former is &s;eldom opened, and the Zeal of
<PB N="vii" REF="009356_0006_103214DA50BC5CE0">
the latter &s;eems confined to his Pen&s;ion or Salary, from the Society in London. The French have many Indian Chapels, and a great Number of very able and zealous Mi&s;&s;ionaries. Our Indian Intere&s;t hath been for Years de|cre&s;ing&mdash;The French increa&s;ing. Though on our Side the Want of a religious Attention to the Indians, or in other Words, of a religiou&s;ly-politic Conduct towards them, has not been the only In&s;tance of our Mi&s;conduct: yet I be|lieve it hath been the mo&s;t fatal In&s;tance. To the religi|ou&s;ly-politic Mea&s;ures of the French towards the Indians, is the Increa&s;e of their Intere&s;t among them almo&s;t owing. Without a Superiority of Indian Intere&s;t, the French could neither have extended nor maintained tho&s;e Encroachments in this Part of the World, which occa&s;ioned the pre&s;ent War. A con&s;iderable Number of the Indians are attached to the Intere&s;t of the French by the Ties of Religion only; and this to &s;uch a Degree, that they are them&s;elves Mi&s;&s;i|onaries among&s;t other Indians. The&s;e Papi&s;t Indians have catched the per&s;ecuting and intolerant Spirit of Popery, and wage War again&s;t the Engli&s;h upon the inveterate Prin|ciples of that blood-&s;hedding Per&s;ua&s;ion, which is kept up and heightened by the infernal Applau&s;e of their Prie&s;ts. The &s;uper&s;titious and diabolical Spirit of Popery, by the unrighteous Acts and indefatigable Zeal of their Mi&s;&s;iona|ries, is extending it&s;elf among&s;t the Indians in general, and is, I fear, too powerful for any merely political Con|duct of ours towards tho&s;e People to re&s;i&s;t. Without a &s;u|perior Indian Intere&s;t to the French, the Briti&s;h Colonies, though they were environed by the ancient Wall of China, and their numerous Troops, may po&s;&s;ibly be penetrated and &s;ubdued by the&s;e American Taters<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Taters &s;ignifies Rovers.</NOTE>; and the Event, under the Influence of French Ambition and Popi&s;h per&s;e|cuting Principles, would be infinitely more fatal. The Start Popery hath got over the Indians, and its peculiar Advantages, e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to the&s;e Savages, over the utmo&s;t Efforts of Prote&s;tanti&s;m, renders it very dubious, whether a religiou&s;ly-politic Conduct in the Engli&s;h to|wards tho&s;e People will be able to throw the Ballance of In|dian Intere&s;t into our Scale. Hence a Que&s;tion ari&s;es, Whether any Thing le&s;s than an ab&s;olute Conque&s;t of the French in North-America can &s;ecure the Briti&s;h Dominions there? Some Papers have been tran&s;mitted to England, which may probably be offered to the Peru&s;al of the Public.
<PB N="viii" REF="009356_0007_103214DC43FE04B8">
Mo&s;t of the&s;e Strictures, with &s;ome others, would have had Place in tho&s;e Papers, but the Author thought they did not come within his Plan: if Lei&s;ure and other Circum&s;tances &s;hould con&s;pire, tho&s;e may make a Part of &s;ome future Publication. But as that is at pre&s;ent a Matter of great Uncertainty, the Writer of this Letter was de&s;irous of con|tributing his Te&s;timony to the particular Part of Dr. Brown's E&s;timate as above referred to." I am, Sir, &amp;c.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>As this Gentleman hints at &s;ome further Publications on this important Subject, it were much to be wi&s;hed, that he would fulfil his &s;alutary Purpo&s;e; and if this Addre&s;s &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to reach his Notice, whether in Europe or America, I beg Leave to call upon him, in the Name of his Country, to do this public Service; which may tend &s;till farther to open the Eyes of every Briton, on a Subject upon which the future Security of our North-American Co|lonies, and therefore of Great-Britain her&s;elf will depend.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, till more enlarged Evidences may ari&s;e, it happens to be in my Power to corroborate this Gentleman's Ob&s;ervations, by the concurrent Te&s;timony of Captain Schomberg, another Officer, now in England.</P>
<P>It appears, by authentic Letters which I have &s;een in this Gentleman's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that, at the Beginning of the late War, the French had e&s;tabli&s;hed an able Mi&s;&s;ionary, Mon|&s;ieur MAILLARD, in Acadia, with the Title of Grand Vi|car. This Per&s;on, after making him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Lan|guage, and a&s;&s;imilating his Manners to tho&s;e of the Natives, preached the Roman Catholic Faith among them; and by removing his Habitation from one Place to another, per|formed Ma&s;s and admini&s;tered the Sacrament to more than ten Tribes of Indians, whom by the&s;e Means he had gain|ed ab&s;olutely over to his Command. His Influence among them was &s;o great, that in Reality he &s;tood in the Place of his Ma&s;ter, the French King: a Circum&s;tance which is &s;uf|ficiently confirmed by the following Fact; that Captain Schomberg (then Lieutenant in the 40th Regiment) having been &s;ent into Acadia by General Whitmore, and under|&s;tanding the Language of the Country, gained Mr. Mail|lard to the Intere&s;ts of Great-Britain; and &s;olely through his Influence and Authority brought over the&s;e numerous Tribes of Savages, from being the Enemies, to be the Friends of our Country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author with Plea&s;ure lays hold of this Opportunity of doing a Piece of Ju&s;tice to Captain Schomberg; who with a Zeal uncom|mon in a young Officer, brought over the&s;e Indian Tribes to the In|tere&s;ts of Great-Britain, at a Time when they were our mo&s;t danger|ous Enemies. This he effected at a con&s;iderable Expence, as well as Fatigue and Hazard, to him&s;elf. Yet, through the Death of General Whitmore, and &s;ome other unfortunate Incidents, he never hath been re-imbur&s;ed; nor hath ever had any Acknowledgment, for this Ser|vice done to his Country. This Fact is made public, not with a View of blaming any one; but &s;olely in Hope, that &s;ome noble-minded Per&s;on, who may have Power and Inclination, may al&s;o have the Opportunity or redre&s;&s;ing &s;o uncommon a Grievance,</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="009356_0008_103214DE26F08950">
From the&s;e inconte&s;table Facts, then, it appears, what a zealous and active Enemy you have to oppo&s;e, in the Papi&s;t Mi&s;&s;ionaries who have been long and powerfully di&s;per&s;ed among the Indian Tribes; and who, you may depend up|on it, will continue their unweary'd Endeavours, to bring them over to the Principles of the Roman Church.</P>
<P>Let me now conclude with another Circum&s;tance of Dan|ger, which mu&s;t not be omitted here. Before the Com|mencement of the late War, the Principles and Mini&s;ters of Popery, though near, yet were not mixed with the Co|lonies of Great-Britain. But by the Terms of Capitulati|on, both at Quebec and Montreal, the Roman Catholic Re|ligion is tolerated in the &s;everal Settlements conquered from the Crown of France. The Con&s;equence of this mu&s;t be, a frequent Intercour&s;e and Communication of Prote&s;tants with Bapi&s;ts; a Circum&s;tance &s;o pregnant with Danger, &s;uppo&s;ing Zeal on the one Part, and Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s on the other, that I think it were needle&s;s to enlarge upon it, in order to rouze you into Caution.</P>
<P>What, then, is the proper Part for the Inhabitants of our Colonies to act, under Circum&s;tances &s;o delicate and important? Extirpation, or even Per&s;ecution, the Princi|ples of our Excellent Religion, as well as the Humanity of our Manners, and the good Faith of our Politics, do ab&s;o|lutely fobid: Nothing therefore is left for you to do, but to combat fal&s;e Zeal with Zeal which is according to Know|ledge: to be united and firm in maintaining, in communi|cating, in e&s;tabli&s;hing the great and e&s;&s;ential Principles of Chri&s;tianity, throwing off the Sin which may &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et you, that of too great Eagerne&s;s and unchri&s;tian Contenti|on, about tho&s;e &s;econdary and incidental Differences of Opi|nion which &s;eem to divide you into various Sects, while you all rejoyce in one common Day, which the glorious Light of the Go&s;pel hath &s;pread over the Briti&s;h Dominions.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;alutary, great, and glorious Purpo&s;es, the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment of Colleges in America can alone thoroughly ef|fect.
<PB N="x" REF="009356_0009_103214DFAAEDE228">
For in the fir&s;t Place, the frequent Communication and Intercour&s;e, which this E&s;tabli&s;hment will naturally create among Prote&s;tants of every Denomination in Ameri|ca, will of Cour&s;e tend to wear off that mutual Di&s;like, which often ari&s;es, and is always increa&s;ed, by that Di&s;tance and Re&s;erve which different Sects of Religion commonly maintain towards each other. By the&s;e Means you will often find your Principles the &s;ame, where you before thought they had differed: By the&s;e Means, you will often find you have wi&s;hed each other well, when both Parties &s;u&s;pected the contrary.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, the &s;trong and powerful E&s;tabli&s;hment of American Colleges can alone effectually produce the &s;econd great End above explained; I mean the counter-working the De&s;igns of Popery, and the Civilization and Conver&s;ion of the &s;avage Indians. While Things remain in their pre|&s;ent Situation, there is no Probability that ever a &s;ufficient Number of able and zealous Labourers will inli&s;t in this di&s;couraging Vineyard. Men bred up in the di&s;tant and alluring Climate of Great-Britain, will never be fond of quitting their native Country, in que&s;t of unknown and un|profitable Service: But when Seminaries &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed on the Spot, for this important Purpo&s;e; the youthful Minds, there formed to this End, will take their bent ac|cordingly: They will be early taught to regard this as their peculiar Province and De&s;tination; and hence, with due Encouragements given, will proceed with Zeal to their ap|pointed Ta&s;k; and in the End, where the rank Weeds of Violence and Idolatry now abound, will plant and reap a noble Harve&s;t of true Religion and Virtue.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e to accept the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, as a &s;incere though imperfect Te&s;timony of that Re&s;pect with which</P>
