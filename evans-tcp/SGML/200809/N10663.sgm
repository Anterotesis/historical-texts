recovered from the Ruins of the Apo&s;tacy, and re-admitted into the Family of Heaven, it is by &s;low Degrees that we attain to a State of Felicity and Glory. We mu&s;t pa&s;s through a tedious Pilgrimage, before we arrive at our de&s;tin'd Home: We mu&s;t endure many &s;uffer|ings upon Earth, before we enter into cele&s;tial Joy.</P>

Danger; but ta&s;te unmingled Felicity and Joy. &mdash;But Man is fallen from his original Excel|lence, and plunged into an Aby&s;s of Mi&s;ery. Having departed from God, he is deprived of the amiable Image of the Deity; and become a Prey to the mo&s;t infamous Appetites. A deluded Under&s;tanding leads him into endle&s;s Mazes of Error and Folly: He pur&s;ues a va|ni&s;hing Shadow, and de&s;pi&s;es the true Felicity of his Nature: Captivated with the Charms of Sen&s;e, he neglects the Purity and Perfection of his immortal Spirit: Dazzled with a gav Ap|pearance, he follows every glittering Phantom: Corrupted in his moral Ta&s;te, he ru&s;hes into the Embraces of the mo&s;t polluting Plea&s;ures: Unmindful of his heavenly Birth, his Affections are chained down to the Enjoyments of this inferior Earth: Seduced by flattering Dreams, he &s;leeps on &s;ecurely, till the Light of Eternity di&s;covers the fatal Mi&s;take&mdash;So &s;trong is the Deception while Men remain under the Power of depraved Nature, that we imagine our&s;elves free, even when we are the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ive Slaves.

With thoughtle&s;s Gaiety, we tread the beaten Road that leads to Death and Hell. &mdash;To fini&s;h our Unhappine&s;s, our Maker is offended; <HI>his Wrath is revealed from Heaven again&s;t</HI> us; the Sentence of his righteous Law condemns us to eternal Death.&mdash;To what Sanctuary &s;hall we fly in this lo&s;t and de&s;perate State?&mdash;Can we bribe inexorable Ju&s;tice&mdash;Can

<P>IN this melancholy Situation, a Reprieve mu&s;t be acknowledged a Favor; a Mitigation of our Puni&s;hment an unmerited Mercy; but the glad Tidings of Deliverance, one would think, mu&s;t be received with Tran&s;ports of Gratitude.&mdash;To publi&s;h this Good News is the De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel; and the whole Number of the &s;aved attend to the con&s;olatory Me&s;&s;age with an humble Faith.&mdash;As a nece&s;&s;ary Con|&s;equence of this&mdash;</P>

<P>BUT how can this be?&mdash;Do not true Be|lievers inhabit a World of Sorrow? Are they not defiled with innumerable Corruptions? Is not Satan continually di&s;turbing their Peace? Does not the World with it's treacherous Smiles, frequently betray Men into Sin? Do they not groan under the Burden of various Afflictions? Mu&s;t they not &s;ubmit to the Empire of Death?

<P>TO be happy, is the univer&s;al De&s;ire of all Mankind. There are two Kinds of Happine&s;s that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our View and court our Affections: The one con&s;i&s;ts in the Enjoy|ment of the Pomps and Plea&s;ures of this Life,

<P>EVERY impartial Ob&s;erver, mu&s;t be imme|diately &s;en&s;ible, that the&s;e Words plainly declare that the Salvation of Mankind is not the Effect of their own Policy or Power, but an unde&s;erved Favor: That it cannot be obtained by the Im|provement of our natural Abilities, but de|&s;cends from <HI>the Father of Lights, the Giver of every good Gift.</HI></P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing on this Point, I &s;hall enquire what is intended by Grace&mdash;How it appears that the Salvation of Sinners is entirely of Grace.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST. WHAT is intended by GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>GRACE &s;ignifies a free Favor, not granted to Merit&mdash;not founded on &s;uperior Excellence &mdash;but flowing from unpurcha&s;ed Benevolence. That Angels are adorned with the noble Perfections of their Nature, placed in the hea|venly Sanctuary, pre&s;erved in their primitive Integrity, and made the favorite Mini&s;ters of
<PB N="19" REF="013514_0022_0F90F5B11442D420">
Divine Providence, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to unme|rited Grace. No Creature can challenge any Thing of the Creator: All their Excellencies flow from his di&s;intere&s;ted Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>ADAM was made an Inhabitant of Paradi&s;e, advanced to the Government of this lower World, by the &s;ame free Favor. All the Privi|leges of his Nature, and the Advantages of his Situation, were the Effects of pure Goodne&s;s. &mdash;But when Man lo&s;t the Glory of his Inno|cence and became a guilty Criminal&mdash;then the Triumphs of Grace appeared in the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Point of Light.&mdash;Innocent Man had nothing to claim from his Maker, but what flow'd from his gracious Promi&s;e&mdash;and &s;inful Man had every Thing to fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from his offended Sovereign, who&s;e Favors he had abu&s;ed.&mdash; When, therefore, God delivers us from the Puni&s;hment we had de&s;erved, and re&s;tores us to the Privileges we had forfeited, it is not <HI>only Grace,</HI> but <HI>the Riches of Grace.</HI> He be&s;tows his Favors on tho&s;e who are &s;o far from having any Excellency to recommend them, that their Guilt ju&s;tly expo&s;es them to his &s;evere&s;t Di&s;|plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THIS is that GRACE, which the Apo&s;tle celebrates in the Words of my Text&mdash;This re&s;cues us from the Tyranny of Satan&mdash;the Dominion of Sin&mdash;the Puni&s;hment of Death.&mdash; This re&s;tores guilty Criminals to the Favor of

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SECONDLY, How it appears that the Salva|tion of Sinners is entirely of Grace.</HEAD>
<P>IF we examine the various Parts of this Salvation&mdash;if we &s;urvey it's different Degrees &mdash;if we pur&s;ue it's Progre&s;s in all the Periods of the pre&s;ent Life, and through the uncea&s;ing Ages of Eternity, we &s;hall be immediately convinced&mdash;That it cannot be challenged as a Claim of Ju&s;tice&mdash;it cannot be acquired by the Powers of unregenerate Nature&mdash;nor are we introduced into this happy State as the Reward of our good Works.</P>

Creation. If therefore Almighty Grace had not contrived a Way to an&s;wer the De|mands of Ju&s;tice, every Sinner of the human Race mu&s;t have fallen a Sacrifice to it's righ|teous Claims.&mdash;That Ju&s;tice which expelled the apo&s;tate Angels from the Happine&s;s of Heaven, would have condemned rebellious Man to the Torments of Hell&mdash;Angels and Men united to reject the Authority of the Great God, and de&s;erved the &s;ame Puni&s;hment.&mdash;That Men are Pri&s;oners of Hope, and fallen Angels delivered over to final De&s;pair, is not the Claim of Ju&s;tice, but the Work of di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace.&mdash;This pities Criminals condemned to Death, freely forgives their Offences, and re&s;tores them to Favor.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II. As Salvation is not a Claim of Ju&s;tice; neither can it be acquired by the Powers of unregenerate Nature.</HEAD>
<P>FOR Human Nature in it's pre&s;ent degenerate State is deeply and univer&s;ally corrupted: Not only aver&s;e to that which is &s;piritually good, but fatally inclined to that which is evil &mdash;When God de&s;cended from Heaven to &s;urvey the State of the moral World&mdash;This is the melancholy Report&mdash;<HI>The Thoughts and Imaginations of Mens Hearts are evil, only evil, and that conti|nually.</HI>&mdash;In conformity to this divine Te&s;timony <HI>St. Paul,</HI> who learnt his Divinity in the School of Heaven, declares that of our&s;elves we are

<HI>in&s;ufficient for &s;o much as a good Thought</HI>&mdash; If in&s;ufficient to think a good Thought, then certainly incapable to perform a good Action. Our BLESSED SAVIOR a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>a bad Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit;</HI> nor a corrupt <HI>Fountain</HI> &s;end forth &s;alutary <HI>Streams.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this Plan the mo&s;t inlightned Teachers of the Chri&s;tian Church have always maintained, that the Performances of unregenerate Sinners don't recommend them to the e&s;pecial Favor of God, nor give them a Claim to the &s;aving Gifts of his Holy Spirit. A diligent Cultiva|tion of our rational Powers&mdash;a Life conducted by the Precepts of moral Virtue, adorn the Characters of Men and render them Ble&s;&s;ings to Civil Society: But they cannot be accepta|ble to God, when they flow from <HI>a carnal Mind,</HI> which an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle declares <HI>is Enmity to God.</HI></P>
<P>MEN who are favored with divine Revelation certainly enjoy Advantages &s;uperior to tho&s;e who have no other In&s;tructor than the Light of Nature;&mdash;but the&s;e will be ineffectual to our Salvation, if not accompanied with the internal Operations of the Spirit. The Word of God may &s;ound in our Ears, and not penetrate our Hearts.&mdash;Let the Law proclaim it's formidable Cur&s;es, we &s;hall be deaf to it's alarming Voice &mdash;Let the Go&s;pel publi&s;h it's gracious Invita|tions, we &s;hall be unaffected with it's delightful

<P>MANY profe&s;s an high E&s;teem for the in|&s;pired Scriptures, and acknowledge that Grace is a nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tant to frail and fallible Man: But they depend on the Sincerity of their Hearts, the Purity of their Intentions, the Re|gularity of their Lives, to recommend them to this important Ble&s;&s;ing.

<HEAD>I. WE have a Te&s;t by which we may examine the Truth of the Doctrines we receive.</HEAD>
<P>THE great De&s;ign of God, in the Salvation of Sinners, is to di&s;play the Glory of his Grace. <HI>He hath made us to &s;it down together in hea|venly Places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that He might &s;hew the exceeding Riches of his Grace in his Kindne&s;s towards us through Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> To dimini&s;h this Grace, is to darken the Glory of the Go&s;pel, and deprive the ble&s;&s;ed God of that Tribute of Prai&s;e He expects from all his redeemed People.</P>
<P>EVERY Opinion which exalts the Powers of human Nature in it's pre&s;ent degenerate State, undermines the Foundation of the Chri&s;tian Faith, and prevents us from that Re&s;ignation to divine Sovereignty, which becomes the Cha|racter of apo&s;tate Creatures. That Doctrine which a&s;cribes the entire Glory of our Salva|tion to God bears the Stamp of Divinity, and will ever recommend it&s;elf to tho&s;e who have been taught in the School of a crucified Savior.</P>
<P>IT has always been the Stratagem of Satan, to employ the Powers of Wit and Learning, to &s;upport the Fabrick of human Pride and render Men vain in their own Imaginations: But it is the con&s;tant Work of the Spirit to humble the Sinner in the Du&s;t; convince him that he is ab&s;olutely lo&s;t; that there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of his Recovery, but by a Grace to which he has no Claim, which he has forfeited

<P>IN my following Di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall endeavor to explain the Nature of that FAITH by which we are &s;aved&mdash;and conclude with &s;ome IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P>THERE is a Faith which is common to the Children of God and the Servants of Sin. Faith is often mentioned as the di&s;tingui&s;hing Character of the Saints, and &s;ometimes is a&s;cribed to the wor&s;t of Beings. It formed the brighte&s;t Glory of Abraham the <HI>Friend of God</HI>&mdash;and in&s;pires the apo&s;tate Spirits <HI>with Fear and Trembling.</HI> There mu&s;t then, be an e&s;&s;ential Difference between that Faith by which we are &s;aved and that which may accompany us to eternal Damnation.</P>
<P>FAITH con&s;idered in a religious Sen&s;e is an A&s;&s;urance of tho&s;e Truths, which are revealed in the in&s;pired Scriptures&mdash;It is founded, not on the Conjectures of human Rea&s;on, but on the Authority of God the Revealer. Every Thing which God has revealed or promi&s;ed; every Thing which is contained in the Volumes of the Old and New Te&s;tament; is the proper Object of Faith. But the e&s;pecial Object of
<PB N="37" REF="013514_0040_0F90F5BE058A07A0">
that Faith, which is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Charac|teri&s;tic of the real Chri&s;tian, is JESUS CHRIST &mdash;the eternal SON OF GOD&mdash;the appointed SAVIOR of a revolted World &mdash;He offered up him&s;elf a Sacrifice to divine Ju&s;tice, that we might not be condemned at it's awful Bar&mdash;He ful|filled all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that we might have a valid Title to the Reward of Life eternal &mdash; He is propo&s;ed in the Go&s;pel in all the Glories of an all&s;ufficient and conde&s;cending SAVIOR, to be received as <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> to be tru&s;ted in by all tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ible of their Guilt and Mi&s;ery, and de&s;ire to obtain the Ble&s;&s;ings of Salvation.&mdash;Faith is a Per&s;wa&s;ion, that it is the &s;ole Prerogative of this adorable Per&s;on to re&s;tore our lap&s;ed Race to the Favor of God;&mdash; or to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the Language of In&s;pira|tion, <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is no other Name under Heaven given a|mong Men whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved.</HI> Acts iv. 12.</P>
<P>THIS Faith is often de&s;cribed in the Go&s;pel to be a firm Belief&mdash;THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD&mdash;the promi&s;ed MESSIAH.&mdash; Con&s;equently, that his Doctrine is divine&mdash;His Promi&s;es certain&mdash;which &s;hall infallibly be accompli&s;hed in their appointed Order.&mdash;We believe what the &s;acred Hi&s;torians have recorded of His miraculous Birth&mdash;His un&s;potted Life&mdash; His wonderful Works&mdash;His meritorious Death &mdash;His glorious Re&s;urrection&mdash;His triumphant A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven&mdash;His prevalent Inter|ce&s;&s;ion at <HI>the Right Hand of the Father.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="013514_0041_0F90F5BF78426B88">THESE Truths are received as <HI>faithful Say|ings,</HI> not becau&s;e they could be di&s;covered by human Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they are authenti|cated by a divine Te&s;timony.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>the Son of God</HI> commands us to re|ceive Him as a Me&s;&s;enger from Heaven, He gives the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable Evidences of the Divinity of his Mi&s;&s;ion.

<P>IN this critical Moment, Nature through all her Works declares his Dignity and Glory;&mdash; even the Inhabitants of the Grave ari&s;e to do Honor to Him who has <HI>the Keys of the invi|&s;ible World</HI>&mdash;He entered the Grave, not by Nece&s;&s;ity of Nature, but voluntary Con&s;ent.&mdash; He triumphed over the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> in his own Dominions, and a&s;cended like an invinci|ble Conqueror to immortal Life.&mdash;This &s;et the Seal of Heaven to the Truth of his Mi&s;&s;ion, ju&s;tified his highe&s;t Preten&s;ions, and in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner declared that He was exalted to be a PRINCE and a SAVIOR.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="013514_0042_0F90F5BFB60B6F18">THEY who yield an unfeigned A&s;&s;ent to the&s;e Truths are frequently &s;aid to <HI>Believe.</HI> But when this Faith only floats in the Under|&s;tanding, and does not de&s;cend into the Heart, captivate the Affections and regulate the Con|duct of Mankind, it will not evidence that we are true Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, or &s;ecure us a Title to the Privileges which he has purcha&s;ed for his People. <HI>Simon Magus</HI> was made a Pro&s;e|lyte by the Preaching of <HI>Philip</HI>&mdash;he was bap|tized into the Faith of the Go&s;pel, and it is &s;aid that <HI>he al&s;o believed.</HI>&mdash;Yet we have the Te&s;timony of an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle, <HI>that his Heart was not right with God: He was in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bonds of Iniquity.</HI> Daily Experience teaches us, that Mens Judg|ments may be convinced, and the Will remain ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e.

<P>BUT this Faith, in&s;tead of being acceptable to God, increa&s;es His Di&s;plea&s;ure&mdash;So far from being beneficial to Men it adds to their Guilt and Mi&s;ery.

<P>MEN who have been educated in the Prin|ciples of the Chri&s;tian Faith, often receive them as true, without any He&s;itation. When con|vinced of their Guilt, they acknowledge the Nece&s;&s;ity of an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t to deliver them from the Puni&s;hment they have de&s;erved. Animated with a Dread of future Mi&s;ery, in|&s;pired with the Hope of heavenly Happine&s;s, they attempt to give up them&s;elves to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>TO glorify God, the great Author of our Being, ought to be the uninterrupted Employment of every intelligent Crea|ture.

Salvation is fre|quently repre&s;ented as <HI>the Gift of God:</HI> Now we all know, that there is a wide Di&s;tinction between that which is be&s;towed as a free Gift, and that which is obtained as the Reward of Services performed: To e&s;tabli&s;h our Claim to the promi&s;ed Reward, we mu&s;t accompli&s;h our Ta&s;k&mdash;fini&s;h the appointed Work, and punctually comply with all the Articles &s;pecified in the Agreement:&mdash;But to enjoy a Gift, No|thing is requi&s;ite, but to realize the Kindne&s;s of our Benefactor, and receive his generous Offer with Gratitude.</P>
<P>THE Difference is as great, as between a Workman who is employed on Wages, and an indigent Beggar who lives upon Charity: The Labourer has no Title to the &s;tipulated Wages, till he has completed the Service expre&s;&s;ed in the Contract; but the poor Mendicant only receives the Alms which are generou&s;ly pre|&s;ented to him.&mdash;The Bounty of the Donor authori&s;es his Claim&mdash;his grateful Acceptance puts him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Benefit.</P>
<P>THIS gives us a per&s;picuous View of the Method, in which we are made Partakers of the Salvation revealed in the Go&s;pel.&mdash;Salvation is not be&s;towed upon us as the Reward of our good Services:&mdash;We cannot challenge it as a

<P>THUS we <HI>are &s;aved by Faith</HI>&mdash;Faith accepts the conde&s;cending Offers of a Savior, and gives God the Glory of that Grace, which He de|&s;igned to magnify in the Recovery of an apo|&s;tate World.&mdash;What is it to believe?&mdash;To give Credit to the Report of the Go&s;pel;&mdash;to receive that Savior who is freely tendered to us;&mdash;to depend on his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to give us a Title to the Favor of God;&mdash;to re&s;ign our&s;elves to his Spirit, to prepare us for the Enjoyment of Life eternal.</P>
<P>UPON this Foundation, all Pretences to Merit are de&s;troyed; all Claims e&s;tabli&s;hed on per&s;onal Worthine&s;s are di&s;allowed. God gives &mdash;and Faith receives a Title to the Dignity and Privileges of <HI>the Sons of God.</HI> There is no Merit in receiving a Gift, though it be nece&s;&s;ary to enjoying the Good which is tendered to me. &mdash;Thus Faith does not give me an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, on the Foot of De&s;ert; but by Virtue of a Divine Con&s;titution. The Wi&s;dom of the Deity did not &s;ee &s;it, that tho&s;e &s;hould have a Title to this Salvation, who were in&s;en&s;ible of their Want of it, or unwilling to receive it:&mdash; They are forever excluded, by an irrever&s;ible

<P>THE De&s;ign of Man's Redemption flowed from the eternal Coun&s;els of Heaven. Before this Univer&s;e exi&s;ted, the Deity fore&s;aw, that many of the free Intelligences He de&s;igned to create, would violate the e&s;tabli&s;hed Orders of his Government and fall from their original Dignity.&mdash;His unbounded Benevolence inclin|ed Him to devi&s;e a Method of Recovery, for many of his rebellious Subjects.&mdash;The &s;inning Angels, the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, are excluded all Hopes of Mercy;&mdash;while the &s;inful Po&s;terity of Adam are appointed to be the Objects of di&s;tingui&s;hing Favors.</P>
<P>INFINITE Wi&s;dom determined, that with|out vindicating the Honor of the Law, there &s;hould be no Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin&mdash;This the Son of God undertook, and voluntarily engaged to &s;ave a guilty World.&mdash;He exhibits Him&s;elf in the Go&s;pel in the Character of a Savior, and gives us the highe&s;t A&s;&s;urance, that all who believe in Him &s;hall experience the ble&s;&s;ed Effects of his Power and Grace.&mdash;But if Men wilfully refu&s;e the kind Hand that is extended for their Deliverance, there is Nothing remains but that they peri&s;h in their Sins.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="013514_0064_0F90F5D6A94F0320">THIS is the immutable Appointment, not only of the Sovereignty but Wi&s;dom of Hea|ven&mdash;Faith is the appropriated Way to Life&mdash; becau&s;e it brings nothing with it, but receives all from the Fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t&mdash;It pleads guilty before God, and implores a free Pardon&mdash;It acknowledges the Sinner's Inability to all &s;pi|ritual Good, and &s;upplicates that Grace which mu&s;t <HI>perform all our Works in us.</HI>&mdash;Thus God alone is exalted, and human Vanity pro&s;trate in the Du&s;t: All Self-dependance is renounced and Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s received as a Com|munication from Chri&s;t: The Crown is placed upon the Head of our <HI>incarnate God,</HI> and the entire Glory of our Salvation is a&s;cribed to free Grace.&mdash;This forms the Excellency of Faith, and di&s;covers it to be a fit Method to &s;ave tho&s;e who are utterly ruined in them&s;elves. Upon this Account <HI>St. Paul</HI> having declared that we are <HI>&s;aved through Faith,</HI> in the next Ver&s;e excludes <HI>Works,</HI> and gives this Rea&s;on&mdash; <HI>le&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>THUS God and his elect Angels&mdash;the Devil and his malicious A&s;&s;ociates&mdash;con&s;pire to evi|dence the Greatne&s;s of that Salvation which is revealed in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>FIRST, The Plan of this Salvation was formed in the eternal Coun&s;els of Heaven.</HEAD>
<P>MAN was originally the Favorite of his Almighty Creator: He gave him the fir&s;t Place of Dignity in this vi&s;ible World: He united Heaven and Earth, Matter and Spirit, in the Compo&s;ition of human Nature: He introduced our fir&s;t Parents into Being, in the mo&s;t agreeable Circum&s;tances, and bountifully provided for their Happine&s;s in a State of Innocence.&mdash;But the All-&s;eeing Eye of God, which penetrates into the mo&s;t di&s;tant Futurities, beheld the un|grateful Apo&s;tacy of Man, and formed the De&s;ign of his Recovery.&mdash;He determined that Satan &s;hould not triumph in his Succe&s;s, nor the human Race be irrecoverably ruined.&mdash; Though perfectly happy in the Enjoyment of Him&s;elf, He did not behold with Indifference the Mi&s;ery of Man. Though Millions of
<PB N="95" REF="013514_0098_0F90F5F8A8FDB6A0">
Worlds mu&s;t have &s;tarted into Being at his au|thoritative Command, yet He looked with Compa&s;&s;ion on this revolted Earth, and deter|mined to di&s;appoint the Devices of the Devil.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ublime&s;t Spirits in Heaven would have been eternally at a Lo&s;s to find a Way, in which this benevolent De&s;ign could be accom|pli&s;hed, and the Honor of the Deity pre&s;erved. &mdash;The Demands of Ju&s;tice mu&s;t be an&s;wered, that Mercy may triumph in the Salvation of the Guilty&mdash;The Threatning of the Law mu&s;t be fulfilled, that the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of it's righ|teous Precepts may be pardoned.&mdash;The Dignity of the divine Government mu&s;t be maintained, that condemned Rebels may be re&s;tored to Favor.&mdash;The righteous Governor of the Uni|ver&s;e will evidence his Abhorrence of the Crime, while He receives the Criminal to the Embraces of his Love.</P>
<P>INFINITE Wi&s;dom hath reconciled the&s;e Difficulties, and formed a Plan, which gives the brighte&s;t Di&s;covery of all the Perfections of the Deity, &s;acredly maintains the Maje&s;ty of his Government, and di&s;plays the Riches of his Grace to his apo&s;tate Creatures.&mdash;In Confor|mity to this Plan, the Son of God de&s;cends upon Earth in a human Form, fulfils the Law which we had violated, &s;ubmits to bear the Puni&s;hment of our Crimes; and thus prepares the Way for our Approach unto God, as a
<PB N="96" REF="013514_0099_0F90F56749764978">
compa&s;&s;ionate and reconciled Father.&mdash;Here we have the mo&s;t admirable Di&s;play of divine Love, and the cleare&s;t Evidence of his Hatred to Sin: The Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law is pu|ni&s;hed with awful Severity, and the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or graciou&s;ly forgiven. This is that mighty Pro|jection, which is the A&s;toni&s;hment of Angels, and the Joy of the Redeemed. This gives us an affecting View of the ine&s;timable Value of Salvation&mdash;E&s;pecially if we con&s;ider,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECONDLY, It was purcha&s;ed by the Blood of the Son of God.</HEAD>
<P>IN all Ages, God has done great Things in Favor of his cho&s;en People: For their Sakes, He exerci&s;es his Patience to a revolted World, and delays that important Period, when this vi&s;ible Creation &s;hall be con&s;umed by Fire: For their Sakes, He hath counteracted the e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of Nature, and performed &s;tu|pendous Miracles, in the Sight of Angels and Men: For their Sakes He will &s;hortly <HI>de&s;cend from Heaven with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel and the Trump of God:</HI> From his radiant Throne He will publickly pronounce them his Friends and Favorites, and receive them to a <HI>Kingdom prepared for them from before the Foundation of the World.</HI> But that which rai&s;es the Value of all the&s;e &s;ignal Favors, is the ine&s;timable Price, with which they are purcha&s;ed. I know Nothing &s;o
<PB N="97" REF="013514_0100_0F90F568B6937368">
incomprehen&s;ible to human Rea&s;on, as the Sa|crifice of the Son of God for a guilty World. If this My&s;tery of divine Love had not been predicted by a Succe&s;&s;ion of in&s;pired Prophets, confirmed by numerous and unque&s;tionable Miracles, atte&s;ted by Heaven and Earth, by Angels and Men&mdash;it could never be received as a Truth by any impartial Enquirer. It is difficult to conceive, that God would do &s;o much for mi&s;erable Man. But &s;ince He has given us this &s;urpri&s;ing Di&s;covery of his Love, we may ju&s;tly infer the Greatne&s;s of that Hap|pine&s;s which He de&s;igns for his redeemed People.</P>
<P>ELEVATE your Thoughts, my Brethren, above the&s;e Regions of Sen&s;e, a&s;cend in your devout Contemplations to the Throne of the Eternal Deity; behold THE SON OF GOD <HI>&s;hining in the Brightne&s;s of his Father's Glory,</HI> &s;urrounded with Myriads of adoring Angels.&mdash; Then view Him, de&s;cending upon Earth, co|vered with Wounds, bathed in Blood, nailed to the Cro&s;s, expiring in Death:&mdash;From the Dignity of his Per&s;on, learn the Value of his Sacrifice:&mdash;From the Severity of his Sufferings, learn the Greatne&s;s of his Purcha&s;e.&mdash;<HI>For us Men, and our Salvation,</HI> He appeared upon Earth <HI>in the Form of a Servant,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through the Mi&s;eries of Life, and &s;ubmitted to the Pains of Death. That Salvation, then, mu&s;t be pronounced Great, which was procured at &s;o
<PB N="98" REF="013514_0101_0F90F5696CFD1318">
great a Price. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord would not have for&s;aken the Plea&s;ures of his Father's Bo&s;om, parted with his heavenly Glory, and pa&s;&s;ed through this dark and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Scene of Sufferings, were it not to an&s;wer the mo&s;t important De&s;igns. He knew the ju&s;t Value of Things, and e&s;teemed the Happine&s;s of his People an Equivalent for all the Sorrows of his Life and the Agonies of his Death.&mdash; Therefore we are a&s;&s;ured that He &s;hall <HI>&s;ee the Travail of his Soul and be &s;atisfied.</HI> But fur|ther to confirm this Point, we may con&s;ider,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THIRDLY, The Mi&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t is de&s;igned to make us Partakers of this Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN our ble&s;&s;ed Lord fini&s;hed his Work upon Earth and a&s;cended to the Court of Hea|ven, according to his Promi&s;e, He &s;ent down his Holy Spirit, to convince the World of Sin, to deliver them from it's fatal Dominion, and form them to a Meetne&s;s for the Kingdom of Glory. Every faithful Subject of our adora|ble Redeemer is <HI>ju&s;tified in the Name of Je&s;us and &s;anctified by the Spirit of our God.</HI> This divine Agent not only favors the Church with an external Revelation, but &s;ecretly influences the Minds of Men to attend to the Truths delivered in the in&s;pired Scriptures. He awa|kens them to a Sen&s;e of their Danger while they continue in a State of Sin, animates them
<PB N="99" REF="013514_0102_0F90F56BDEF32050">
with a &s;alutary Concern to <HI>fly from the Wrath to come</HI> &mdash;Though incon&s;iderate Sinners often re&s;i&s;t his &s;acred Operations, and though a fond Attachment to their Lu&s;ts, reject the in|dulgent Methods of divine Grace, he does not immediately abandon his Work, but waits upon them with admirable Patience, repeats his faithful Warnings, continues his friendly Offi|ces, and &s;trives with them, from Day to Day, from Year to Year.</P>
<P>THIS is his general Conduct to Mankind, under the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel. Multi|tudes, for their ungrateful Oppo&s;ition to the Agency of the divine Spirit, are at la&s;t rejected of God, and left <HI>to con&s;ume away in their Ini|quities.</HI> But with re&s;pect to the <HI>Elect,</HI> He continues his Influences, cea&s;es not to &s;trive with them, till their rebellious Hearts are con|quered <HI>in the Day of his Power,</HI> and they are made the Triumphs of divine Love, the Heirs of immortal Glory&mdash;Having produced this happy Change, He watches over them with affectionate Care, enlightens them in Darkne&s;s, &s;upports them in Weakne&s;s, recovers them from their Relap&s;es, defends them in Dangers, and finally makes them victorious over all their &s;piritual Enemies. The Work which He has begun He will never for&s;ake:&mdash;The Seed of Grace which He has implanted in their Hearts, He will cheri&s;h and encrea&s;e, till it produces the Fruits of Immortality and Glory.
<PB N="100" REF="013514_0103_0F90F56D53AAE980">
&mdash;Who can imagine the Holy Spirit would be &s;o &s;edulou&s;ly employed to &s;ecure the Sal|vation of Mankind, were it not an Affair of the greate&s;t Importance. That mu&s;t be of ine&s;timable Value, which is accompli&s;hed at &s;uch an infinite Expence. It is di&s;honourable to &s;uppo&s;e, that God &s;hould &s;end his Son from the Regions of Glory; that the Son &s;hould humble him&s;elf to the Du&s;t of Death, that the Spirit &s;hould employ his Almighty Energy, and not have in view the noble&s;t De&s;igns.</P>
<P>I add,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>FOURTHLY, When any of the Children of Men are made Partakers of this Salvation, it gives Joy to the Angels of Light.</HEAD>
<P>THESE benevolent Spirits, with a di&s;inter|e&s;ted Joy, congratulated the fir&s;t Appearance of a Savior in this lower World; they attended Him through all the Sorrows of Life; they comforted Him at the Approaches of Death; they appeared in Robes of cele&s;tial Glory to adorn the Triumphs of his Re&s;urrection; they accompanied Him with joyful Acclamations in his A&s;cent to the Kingdom of his Father.&mdash; Though they are illu&s;trious Courtiers of Hea|ven, they do not think the Inhabitants of this Earth beneath their Notice: Though they are the mo&s;t exalted Part of the Creation, they di&s;dain not to maintain an Intercour&s;e with Worms of the Du&s;t:&mdash;When <HI>a Sinner is con|verted
<PB N="101" REF="013514_0104_0F90F56E98EEF710">
from the Error of his Ways,</HI> the glad Tidings are propagated through the heavenly Man&s;ions: <HI>There is Joy in the Pre&s;ence of the Angels of God,</HI> that an Addition is made to the happy Society above: They chearfully for&s;ake their Thrones of Glory, to become <HI>mini&s;tring Spirits to tho&s;e who are appointed Heirs of Salvation:</HI> They <HI>encamp about the Dwellings of</HI> the Saints, deliver them from numberle&s;s Dangers, and by a Thou&s;and Offices of Kind|ne&s;s, &s;upport and encourage them in their Pa&s;&s;age through the Wilderne&s;s of this World. When the People of God have fini&s;hed their Work upon Earth, they &s;urround their dying Beds, receive their departing Spirits, guard them from the malignant Powers of Darkne&s;s, conduct them through the Regions of the Air, and &s;afely introduce them into the <HI>Paradi&s;e of God.</HI>&mdash;Thus the Soul of the de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Lazarus</HI> was <HI>carried by Angels into Abraham's Bo&s;om.</HI> &mdash;Thus the Soul of every faithful Servant of Chri&s;t, when delivered from the Body, becomes the Charge of the&s;e heavenly Mini&s;ters.&mdash;Nor do they de&s;i&s;t from their Care, till they have fixed it in the&s;e happy Abodes, where it is &s;ecure from every Danger.&mdash;Surely that Sal|vation mu&s;t be great, which the&s;e exalted Beings &s;o affectionately de&s;ire to promote: They would not willingly leave the rapturous Employments of Heaven, to &s;ecure a trifling Advantage. Incon&s;iderate Mortals may de&s;pi&s;e this Salvation, but it is highly e&s;teemed by

tho&s;e wi&s;e and holy Beings, who live in the Light of the Divine Countenance, and cannot be mi&s;taken in the true Value of Things.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>FIFTHLY. While the Angels rejoice, when any are made Partakers of this Salvation, the Devils triumph, when any by their Fault and Folly are excluded from it.</HEAD>
<P>THE Devil is always repre&s;ented as the Enemy of God and Goodne&s;s. Having de|&s;erted his exalted Station, he envies the Happi|ne&s;s of Mankind. Condemned to the Puni&s;h|ment of eternal Death, he &s;eeks with ince&s;&s;ant Malice to involve others in the &s;ame irremedi|able Ruin.&mdash;To accompli&s;h this accur&s;ed De|&s;ign, he employs every Art, and exerci&s;es in|defatigable Diligence.&mdash;While Men go on &s;ecurely in the Ways of Sin, he flatters them with Hopes of Impunity, rocks them a&s;leep by a thou&s;and deceitful Sugge&s;tions, that they may be in&s;en&s;ible of their Mi&s;ery and Danger. &mdash;If at any Time their guilty Fears are alarmed, he hurries them into the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Amu&s;e|ments of Life; that they may divert their un|ea&s;y Thoughts. He employs their gay Com|panions, by Banter and Ridicule, to era&s;e all &s;erious Impre&s;&s;ions from their Minds.&mdash;If a Sen&s;e of Guilt abide upon their Con&s;ciences, he terrifies them with unrea&s;onable Fears, that the Day of Grace is ended, or that if they give way to their pre&s;ent Impre&s;&s;ions, they mu&s;t bid
<PB N="103" REF="013514_0106_0F90F03AAE26B668">
Adieu to every plea&s;ant Enjoyment, and con|demn them&s;elves to perpetual Melancholy.&mdash; If all the&s;e Attempts are in vain, and we are effectually per&s;waded to give up our&s;elves to our compa&s;&s;ionate Savior, even then he does not abandon his malicious De&s;igns. When he cannot prevent our Happine&s;s, he endeavours to di&s;turb our Peace: When he cannot regain the Empire of our Hearts, he indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;trives to pollute our Per&s;ons and Performances: He follows us to <HI>the Altar of God,</HI> and by a Variety of Temptations, interrupts our Com|munion with Heaven: He pur&s;ues us to the Gates of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and never cea&s;es to di&s;tre&s;s us, till we enter that ble&s;&s;ed World from which he is forever excluded.&mdash;Now, what is it that animates Satan and his confederate Ho&s;ts to employ all their Power and Policy to de&s;troy Mankind?&mdash;They envy us the Enjoy|ment of that Heaven from which they are righteou&s;ly bani&s;hed: Their Malice is &s;o great, that it increa&s;es their Torment to behold others rejoicing in the Favor of God, when they are condemned to an eternal Departure from Him.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to give you &s;ome View of the Greatne&s;s of that Salvation which is revealed in the Go&s;pel.&mdash;It is great in the Judgment of Heaven and Hell.&mdash;The Good|ne&s;s of God and the Malice of Satan&mdash;<HI>the Angels of Light</HI> and the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> &mdash;all con&s;pire to proclaim it's Excellency and Value.</P>

<P>I. IS it not then a&s;toni&s;hing Madne&s;s, to forfeit this Salvation for the meane&s;t Trifles? And yet, O my Brethren, to the Di&s;grace of the Chri&s;tian Name, this is a common Practice. We daily behold Souls capable of the extatic Joys of Heaven, confining their Pur&s;uits to the defiling Plea&s;ures of this degenerate Earth.

<P>THE mo&s;t generous Medicines, if they do not an&s;wer the End for which they were admini&s;tred, often exa&s;perate the Di&s;ea&s;e, and render the Circum&s;tances of the Patient more dangerous: In like Manner, the Go&s;pel, which is de&s;igned to re&s;tore Mankind to &s;piritual Health, if it does not produce the de&s;ired Effect, is attended with the mo&s;t preju|dicial Con&s;equences. If the Methods of Divine Grace are de&s;pi&s;ed they involve us in aggra|vated Guilt, and end in irrecoverable Mi&s;ery. The Puni&s;hment of Infidels, who enjoy the Light of Revelation, will be infinitely more ter|rible than that which &s;hall be inflicted on un|in&s;tructed

Pagans. THE SON OF GOD, whom they de&s;pi&s;e, no longer re&s;ides upon Earth in a State of Poverty and Meanne&s;s; but is a&s;cended above the vi&s;ible Heavens, and &s;ways the Sceptre of the Univer&s;e. The once de&s;pi&s;ed GALI|LEAN is &s;eated on a Throne of Light, Angels pro&s;trate them&s;elves at His Feet, and Devils tremble at the Terrors of His Wrath. He has Crowns of Glory to reward His faithful Sub|jects, and a glittering Sword to de&s;troy His im|placable Enemies.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, we find the Mi&s;ery of the wicked was never painted in more terrible Co|lours, than by that divine Me&s;&s;enger, who <HI>came not to condemn the World, but that the World through Him might be &s;aved.</HI> The <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> who imitated their ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, per&s;waded Men, by <HI>the Terrors of the Lord not to receive the Grace of God in Vain.</HI></P>

<HEAD>FIRST, THE Sentence of inevitable De|&s;truction is pronounced upon the De&s;pi&s;ers of the Go&s;pel by the Ju&s;tice of God.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the po&s;itive Determination of the &s;u|preme and uncontroulable Sovereign of the World&mdash;<HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> This Sentence is fixed in the immutable Decree of God, and will be executed in the appointed Time.

<P>HAD divine Goodne&s;s &s;ignified his Intention to mitigate the Sentence of his righteous Law, or grant a temporary Su&s;pen&s;ion of the de&s;erved Puni&s;hment, it mu&s;t have been acknowledged a Favor, and ought to be received with Grati|tude:&mdash;But He proclaims complete Deliverance to the Captives of Hell&mdash;A Deliverance not to be purcha&s;ed by us, but thankfully received.&mdash; This contains a Freedom from all the Mi&s;eries we feel or fear&mdash;A perfect and perpetual En|joyment of every de&s;irable Good.&mdash;Now, mu&s;t not they peri&s;h, who are unwilling to be &s;aved?&mdash;Should not they remain under Guilt, who refu&s;e the Offer of a Pardon?</P>

<HEAD>SECONDLY, IF impartial Ju&s;tice pronounces the Sentence, the &s;overeign Ruler has Power to put it in Execution.</HEAD>
<P>THIS none can di&s;pute who believe the Exi&s;tence of a God. He who made the World by a Command, can de&s;troy it in a Moment with a Frown. His Power is &s;upreme and indepen|dent: Nothing can alter his Purpo&s;es, or re&s;i&s;t the Execution of his Will: His Smiles diffu&s;e Life and Joy through all the Inhabitants of Heaven: His wrathful Pre&s;ence fills the Regions of Hell with Darkne&s;s, Terror and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>MEN often e&s;cape the Stroke of human Ju&s;tice, by Art and Addre&s;s: They may fly from the Power of the mighty Monarchs of the Earth, and find a Retreat beyond the Limits of their Juri&s;diction: Death always removes us out of their Reach; the Effects of their Anger cannot enter the Repo&s;itory of the Grave:&mdash; But whither &s;hall we flee from God! To what Part of the Univer&s;e can we e&s;cape and be free from his Arre&s;ts! Death it&s;elf conveys us in|to his immediate Pre&s;ence, and delivers us up, the helple&s;s Victims of his Vengeance.</P>
<P>IF indeed the Di&s;&s;olution of the Body was the De&s;truction of the Soul, we might neglect

the Salvation of the Go&s;pel, and e&s;cape all future Puni&s;hment: But to &s;uppo&s;e this, is to contradict the Voice of Rea&s;on, the Te&s;timony of Con&s;cience, the unerring Orcles of Truth. That the Soul of Man is immortal, is a Doctrine of natural and revealed Religion.&mdash;The ancient Philo&s;ophers were in&s;pired with this Hope.&mdash; Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath confirmed it by expre&s;s De|clarations and a&s;toni&s;hing Miracles. The Soul is not formed of the Du&s;t, but immediately de|rived from the Great <HI>Father of Spirits.</HI> The Body is a beautiful Fabrick, fini&s;hed with con|&s;ummate Art; but animated, directed and moved by the immortal Mind: The Body is compo&s;ed of different Parts, and may be de|&s;troyed by innumerable Accidents; but the Soul is a &s;imple uncompounded Sub&s;tance, not liable to a Di&s;&s;olution. The&s;e are &s;trong Pre|&s;umptions in Favor of this important Truth.&mdash; But that which Rea&s;on pronounces probable, revealed Religion declares to be certain. The Sy&s;tem of the Go&s;pel is built on this Founda|tion: They who deny it not only reject the <HI>Religion of Je&s;us,</HI> but are Enemies to the Peace and good Order of civil Society.&mdash;They oppo&s;e tho&s;e Sentiments which are common to all, except the mo&s;t abandoned of the human Race, and level them&s;elves with the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. Not only the Philo&s;ophers of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens,</HI> but <HI>Barbarians</HI> and <HI>Scythians,</HI> will ri&s;e up again&s;t them and condemn them.</P>

They di&s;&s;ipate their Thoughts upon a thou&s;and Objects, and live without Retirement or Reflexion.&mdash;They contemplate the&s;e vi&s;ible Heavens and mea&s;ure the Magnitude, and cal|culate the Di&s;tance of the Stars; but give them&s;elves no Concern to &s;ecure an Entrance into the <HI>Heaven of Heavens,</HI> the Habitation
<PB N="123" REF="013514_0126_0F90F57C357FC918">
of God's favorite People.&mdash;They de&s;cend into the Depths of the Earth, to di&s;cover the Trea&s;ures which are concealed in it's Bo&s;om; but never &s;eriou&s;ly prepare for that deci&s;ive Hour, when they &s;hall have no more Con|nection with this material Sy&s;tem, but become Inhabitants of the invi&s;ible World of Spirits &mdash;Borne on the Wings of Ambition or Avarice, they fly from Pole to Pole, in Search of that Wealth and Honor which vani&s;heth in a Moment; but profanely de&s;pi&s;e that <HI>Honor which comes from God</HI>&mdash;tho&s;e Trea&s;ures which would inrich them forever.</P>
<P>THIS carele&s;s and &s;en&s;ual Cour&s;e of Life might perhaps admit of &s;ome Excu&s;e, if at|tended with no hurtful Con&s;equences; but &s;ince it is incon&s;i&s;tent with all regular Hopes of Salvation; &s;ince, if not awakned out of it, we remain the Children of Wrath; every con&s;iderate Mind mu&s;t condemn Sinners of this Order, as the greate&s;t of Madmen.</P>
<P>WHAT would you think of a Pri&s;oner con|fined in Chains, who knew the Day of his Trial was approaching, that Sentence of Death was ready to be pronounced upon him; and when once pronounced could never be recalled, but would certainly be executed:&mdash;If in this melancholy Situation he was a&s;&s;ured that a Way of E&s;cape was provided:&mdash;But in&s;tead of improving the Opportunity afforded him, he

<P>THIS is but a faint Image of the Madne&s;s which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Hearts of &s;ecure Sinners.&mdash; As much as the Puni&s;hment of Hell is to be dreaded above the momentary Mi&s;eries of this Life, &s;o much greater is the Folly of tho&s;e who neglect <HI>the Day of their Vi&s;itation.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR Folly will be &s;till more manife&s;t if we con&s;ider&mdash;what Motives induce them to &s;o fatal a Procedure.&mdash;Motives &s;o mean and contemptible, that it is a&s;toni&s;hing they have any Influence upon Men endowed with the Powers of Rea&s;on and Reflection. The true Happine&s;s of our Nature is &s;acrificed for a few &s;ordid Delights, which become in&s;ipid by Cu&s;tom, are impaired by the Infirmities of Age, and will certainly be lo&s;t in Death.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON VIII. The JOY of FAITH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 PETER, I. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>Whom having not &s;een ye love, in whom though now ye &s;ee Him not, <HI>YET BE|LIEVING YE REJOICE</HI> with Joy un|&s;peakable and full of Glory.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO rejoice is agreeable to all Mankind; though there are but few, who have a ju&s;t Foundation for it. None have a Claim to this Privilege, but tho&s;e who are in Friend&s;hip with that adorable Being, who is the Fountain of Felicity to all his Creatures. All the human Race are become Enemies to God, through the Depravity of their Natures and the voluntary Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of their Lives: A Reconciliation mu&s;t take place, otherwi&s;e the Enmity will be perpetual, and the Mi&s;ery of Man irrecoverable.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="013514_0131_0F90F57EB9038CF0">IN <HI>Chri&s;t God is reconciling the World unto Him&s;elf:</HI> None can rejoice in God, but tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted in His Dear Son: He has made Satisfaction for the Sins of a guilty World; but tho&s;e who do not receive Him as their Savior are deprived of the Advantages which flow from his Merits and Mediation: He hath purcha&s;ed every Ble&s;&s;ing for his People, but tho&s;e who are not united to Him by Faith, <HI>are Aliens and Strangers from the Commonwealth of I&s;rael and the Covenants of Promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>ST. PETER, in the Words of my Text, de&s;cribes the Character of true Chri&s;tians, and declares their Privilege. That Savior who was once an Inhabitant of this inferior Earth, but now <HI>&s;eated at the Right Hand of the Maje&s;ty on High,</HI> is the Object of their undi&s;&s;embled Affection: They view Him by Faith, in all the Glories of his Per&s;on and Character; <HI>and believing they rejoice.</HI>&mdash;The Words of my Text teach us this Truth, which &s;hall be the Subject of our pre&s;ent Meditation&mdash;
<Q>ALL true Believers have a ju&s;t Foundation for Rejoicing.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate this, let us take a View of &s;ome of their important Privileges.&mdash;Their Sins are forgiven&mdash;Their Per&s;ons and Per|formances are accepted&mdash;Their Natures are
<PB N="129" REF="013514_0132_0F90F58252A0D450">
&s;anctified&mdash;They are the Care of a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Providence&mdash;Nothing can do them any e&s;&s;ential Hurt&mdash;All Things will con&s;pire to promote their real Good&mdash;They have the a&s;&s;ured Pro&s;pect of immortal Glory.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST, THEY may rejoice that their Sins are forgiven.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the Covenant which God e&s;tabli&s;hes with them through Chri&s;t their exalted Head: <HI>I will be merciful to your Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, your Iniquities will I remember no more.</HI> To learn the Value of this Privilege, let us con&s;i|der the Number and Aggravation of our Sins. &mdash;But <HI>who can under&s;tand his Errors!</HI> Who can recount his continual Deviations from the Law of God, the unerring Standard of our Duty! In many Things we all offend, in every Thing we fall &s;hort: The Defects which attend our be&s;t Performances are highly crimi|nal: The Defilements which accompany our pure&s;t Services are ju&s;tly offen&s;ive to the un|&s;potted Maje&s;ty of Heaven.&mdash;What &s;hall we &s;ay of our pre&s;umptuous Violations of the Divine Commands!&mdash;The&s;e are committed again&s;t Light and Love; not through involun|tary Surprize, but deliberate Rebellion: They are peculiarly di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and call aloud for Vengeance.</P>
<P>HOW a&s;toni&s;hing is that Grace! which par|dons all the&s;e Sins of every Order and Degree, with all the heinous Circum&s;tances which
<PB N="130" REF="013514_0133_0F90F5838069D9A8">
attend them.&mdash;With what admiring Gratitude mu&s;t we rejoice in that God, who declares, <HI>He is merciful and gracious, abundant in Good|ne&s;s and Truth, forgiving Iniquity, Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and Sin!</HI></P>
<P>TO increa&s;e our Gratitude we may con&s;ider, the pardoning Mercy of God is not barely a pre&s;ent Benefit, but attended with the mo&s;t la&s;ting and &s;alutary Effects. It a&s;&s;ures us of immediate Safety, and pre&s;erves us from future Condemnation. The Sentence of Ab&s;olution is pa&s;t in Favor of every true Believer in the Court of Heaven, and will never be revoked, through the varying Scenes of the pre&s;ent Life, or the unchanging Ages of Eternity. Well might the P&s;almi&s;t triumph in his Happine&s;s, and pronounce a Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s on the Man <HI>who&s;e Iniquities are forgiven.</HI></P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e a Malefactor condemned to &s;uffer an infamous Death; the Day is come; the appointed Hour approaches, in which he mu&s;t deliver him&s;elf into the Hands of the Executioner; he beholds with weeping Eyes and a trembling Heart, the &s;olemn Preparation made for his Puni&s;hment.&mdash;If in the critical Moment a Pardon arrive, which delivers him from all his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Fears; will not his Heart leap for Joy, and Nature &s;ink under the exce&s;&s;ive Tran&s;port?&mdash;But God be&s;tows a more ine&s;timable Favor on the true Believer.&mdash; He delivers him not from the Pains of a
<PB N="131" REF="013514_0134_0F90F0422D062F20">
Moment, but from uncea&s;ing Torments. He re&s;tores him, not to a temporal, but an eternal Life.&mdash;To increa&s;e the Kindne&s;s,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SECONDLY, HE admits them to Friend|&s;hip; their Per&s;ons and Performances are accepted.</HEAD>
<P>A PRINCE may pardon a Criminal and not enroll him among the Number of his Acquain|tance: He may open the Doors of his Pri&s;on, and not advance him to the Dignity of a Fa|vorite. But God manife&s;ts his Love to tho&s;e, who receive <HI>Forgivene&s;s through the Blood of Je&s;us:</HI> He not only obliterates the Remem|brance of their Guilt, but embraces them in the Arms of Favor: He not only admits them among the Train of his menial Servants, but exalts them to the Honors and Privileges of his Children: His Anger is removed; He beholds them with Complacency and Delight, and through his dear Son, graciou&s;ly accepts their poor imperfect Services.</P>
<P>WHO can comprehend their Dignity and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s! They have free Acce&s;s to the Throne of Grace, and may approach his Pre&s;ence with filial Confidence: They may implore his Aid in every Exigence; and take Shelter <HI>under the Shadow of his Wings</HI> in every Danger: He gives them a &s;acred A&s;&s;u|rance, that <HI>He is their</HI> GOD, and that all his awful and amiable Attributes &s;hall be exerted for their Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="013514_0135_0F90F584EFE04578">THIS is a perpetual Source of the mo&s;t refined and tran&s;porting Joy.&mdash;<HI>This God is my God,</HI> may the Believer &s;ay;&mdash;not barely by an external Title, but by a firm and indi&s;&s;o|luble Covenant: He not only honors me with the Name, but affords me the Happine&s;s of his Children: Surely this is an all&s;ufficient Portion; we may rejoice in it, though de&s;ti|tute of all other Comfort. <HI>Although the Fig-Tree &s;hall not blo&s;&s;om, neither &s;hall Fruit be in the Vines, the Labor of the Olives &s;hall fail, and the Fields &s;hall yield no Meat, the Flock &s;hall be cut off from the Fold, and there &s;hall be no Herd in the Stalls: Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my Salvation.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THIRDLY, THIS Re&s;toration to the Divine Favor is always accompanied with the Sanctification of our Nature.</HEAD>
<P>NO Change in our Nature can make us happy, while we remain the Servants of Sin: Our di&s;cordant Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t keep us in pepetual Di&s;quietude: The Brea&s;ts of the Wicked are like the tempe&s;tuous Ocean, in con&s;tant Agitation.&mdash;But the Divine Spirit, which re&s;ides in the Heart of the true Believer, rectifies the Di&s;orders of our cor|rupted Nature, and introduces Peace and Har|mony, in&s;tead of lawle&s;s Riot and Confu&s;ion. &mdash;He implants an heavenly Principle, which inclines us to revere the Authority of the Great God, to obey the unerring Dictates of his
<PB N="133" REF="013514_0136_0F90F585343CDD20">
Word, and regulate our various Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions by the Laws of Rea&s;on and Religion. &mdash;By the benign Influences of this ble&s;&s;ed Agent&mdash;I ight &s;ucceeds to Darkne&s;s&mdash;Order to Confu&s;ion&mdash;Beauty to Deformity. The Storms of Pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ide, the &s;avage Di&s;po&s;ition is &s;oftned and &s;ubdued.&mdash;The Proud become meek&mdash;the Moro&s;e, benevolent&mdash;and Mon|&s;ters of Vice, Examples of the mo&s;t amiable Virtues. The tyrannical Empire of Sin is con|quered, and that <HI>Kingdom</HI> &s;et up in the Souls of Men, <HI>which con&s;i&s;ts in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>BELIEVERS being thus re&s;tored to the Favor of God and brought to &s;ubmit to his equitable Government,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FOURTHLY, THEY become the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Care of Divine Providence.</HEAD>
<P>THAT all comprehending Eye, which with a &s;ingle Glance, &s;urveys the whole Creation, is fixed upon them as the Objects of his com|placential Regards:&mdash;That unerring Wi&s;dom, that directs the &s;tupendous Revolutions of Nature, is their unfailing Companion and Guide:&mdash;That omnipotent Arm, whith No|thing can re&s;i&s;t, is their Guard and Defence: <HI>He</HI> who <HI>maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Mini&s;ters Flames of Fire, gives</HI> the&s;e benevo|lent Beings <HI>Charge concerning them, to keep them in all their Ways.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="013514_0137_0F90F585F5FE5B70">WELL then, may they rejoice, though &s;ur|rounded with Darkne&s;s, Difficulty and Danger. God is their <HI>Sun,</HI> to direct their Way; their <HI>Shield</HI> to defend them from their numberle&s;s Enemies. They are conducted through the Wilderne&s;s of this World, by his Word and Spirit: They are pre&s;erved in Safety by his guardian Care. The Faithful may therefore triumph in their Almighty Protector and Friend, and &s;ay with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, Becau&s;e He is at my Right-Hand I &s;hall not be moved.&mdash;Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death I will fear no Evil.</HI>&mdash;In Con&s;equence of this di&s;tingui&s;hed Care of Divine Providence, I proceed to &s;ay,</P>

<HEAD>FIFTHLY, NOTHING can do them any e&s;&s;ential Hurt.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR Security is founded on their Union to the Son of God, and confirmed by an un|alterable Promi&s;e, that <HI>Nothing &s;hall &s;eperate them from his Love.</HI> In this Situation they may po&s;&s;e&s;s their Souls in Peace, amid&s;t the Tempe&s;ts which di&s;turb the Repo&s;e of the Re&s;t of Mankind. The Ba&s;is of their Happi|ne&s;s remains un&s;haken, in all the Revolutions which take Place in this lower World. At|tached to their exalted Head, who holds the Reins of univer&s;al Empire, they &s;hall finally overcome the Power and Policy of their Ene|mies. They may be &s;erene in the greate&s;t Dangers; &s;ecure in the &s;evere&s;t Trials; happy in the mo&s;t afflicted Condition.</P>

<P>WHILE we re&s;ide upon Earth, we nece&s;|&s;arily partake of tho&s;e Mi&s;eries which are in&s;eperable from a State of Mortality; but when removed from this <HI>Valley of Tears,</HI> we enter on the true Felicity and Glory of our Natures.

<P>IN &s;ome favorite Moments, the faithful Servants of God experience tho&s;e divine Con|&s;olations, which change this Earth into a Para|di&s;e of Delights: Filled with the tran&s;porting Views of a Savior's Excellency and Beauty, the World vani&s;hes from their Sight: In&s;pired with Love of the &s;upreme Good, all Creatures appear as comparative Nothings.
