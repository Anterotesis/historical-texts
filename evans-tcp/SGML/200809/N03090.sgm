<P>IN this Chapter <HI>Paul</HI> declares before King <HI>Agrippa</HI> and others, his extraordinary Con|ver&s;ion and Call to the Apo&s;tolic Office. When he &s;et out on his Journey towards <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> it was breathing out threatnings and &s;laughter again&s;t the Di&s;ciples of the LORD; but behold, the triumph of Al|mighty Power and Sovereign Grace!

fallen to the Earth, &s;aid to him, <HI>Saul, Saul,</HI> why per&s;ecuted thou me? So near is the relation between CHRIST the Head, and the Members of His my&s;tical Body, that what is done to them, he takes as done to him&s;elf. 1 Cor. xii. 12. <HI>As the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: &s;o al&s;o is Chri&s;t.</HI> Mat. xxv. 40. And now, trembling, he &s;ays, <HI>Who art thou Lord?</HI> He knew not that JESUS was the <HI>promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> till he thus revealed him&s;elf to him. And how wonderful is it that this Appearance &s;hould be, not only to Convert him, but al&s;o to Call him to be an Apo&s;tle, that he might Convert many others! Divine Goodne&s;s overcame his Evil, and where Sin did abound, Grace &s;uper-abounded.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here take notice of &s;everal things as they lie in the Text. 1. He was <HI>Call'd</HI> to be a <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> and this he had in common with others that preach the Go&s;pel; however he was al&s;o call'd to be a <HI>Witne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, whom he had now &s;een; and received extraordi|nary Gifts whereby he might confirm his Te&s;timony. 2. We have a <HI>Promi&s;e of deliverance</HI> from the People &amp;c. <HI>ver.</HI> 17. By the People, under&s;tand the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were many of them filled with rage again&s;t him upon his turning Chri&s;tian. GOD protected him under innumerable Dangers while he had Work for him to do, and then gave him the crown of Martyrdom; Faith and patience and courage to &s;uffer for the Name of JESUS, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 6. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory informs us that he was beheaded under <HI>Nero.</HI> 3. We have the <HI>great Errand</HI> upon which he was <HI>&s;ent,</HI> ver. 18. <HI>To open their Eyes &amp;c. Paul</HI> was in a peculiar manner the Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, who were under Heathen-ignorance, and &s;o under the power of Satan.&mdash;He is &s;ent <HI>to turn them from darkne&s;s &amp;c.</HI> that is, as on In&s;trument in the hand of CHRIST, who&s;e Work this is. 4. We have the <HI>gracious De&s;ign</HI> of our LORD in this Work, and the End which crowns it: <HI>That they may rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ve forgivene&s;s &amp;c.</HI> 5. We have <HI>his obedient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> to this divine Call, <HI>ver.</HI> 19. Our LORD &s;pake to his Heart, and made him willing in the day of his power. He tells us, <HI>Gal.</HI> i 15, 16.

<HEAD>DOCT. I. Our LORD JESUS CHRIST calls and &s;ends forth the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel.</HEAD>
<P>Ver. 16.&mdash;<HI>To make thee a Mini&s;ter</HI>&mdash;ver. 17.&mdash;<HI>Unto whom I &s;end thee.</HI> Indeed this <HI>Call</HI> was <HI>immediate,</HI> neither of Men, nor by Men; but by a glorious Appearance of CHRIST, and his Voice from Heaven: however, he continues to &s;peak to his People in his Word, and to declare his will; and therefore tho' Men may be the In&s;truments, yet when the Rules of the Go&s;pel of CHRIST are ob&s;erv'd, the Call of Mini&s;ters is from him. This Divine Per&s;on, GOD-Man-Mediator, is the glorious Head of his Church, who&s;e Prerogative it is to ap|point the Laws and Ordinances of his Hou&s;e, and Officers that are to act under him in his vi&s;ible Kingdom on Earth. Accordingly, after his Re&s;urrection, He &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t: Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what|&s;oever I have commanded you,</HI> Mat. xxviii. 18,&mdash;20. And when our LORD a&s;cended on high, he received Gifts for Men, and he gave &s;ome <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI>&mdash;: and &s;ome, <HI>Pa&s;tors and Teachers,</HI> Eph. iv 11. Now, that the&s;e ordinary Officers la&s;t mentioned, were appointed to &s;ucceed the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> in the Work of the Mini&s;try, is evident from the great de&s;ign of this Gift and In&s;titution. It follows, ver. 12, 13. <HI>For the perfecting of the &s;aints, for the work of the mini&s;try, for the edifying of the body of Chri&s;t: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI> Upon which Mr. <HI>Burkitt</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> declares how long the Work of the Mini&s;try appointed by CHRIST for his Church's edification and advantage, was to continue; namely, to the End of the World, <HI>till all come</HI> &amp;c.</Q> And this is further evident from the directions given in GOD's Word, re&s;pecting the Qualifications of &s;uch Mini&s;ters, and their Separation to this Work. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 2,&mdash;11. <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 5,&mdash;9. And whereas they &s;tand in ab&s;olute need of the Pre&s;ence of CHRIST with them, His mo&s;t gracious Promi&s;e given when He commi&s;&s;ion'd his Di&s;ciples to teach in his Name, was not re&s;train'd to them, and the Age wherein they liv'd; but ex|tended to Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters to the End of the World. Mat. xxviii. 20.&mdash;<HI>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the World.</HI> And ina&s;much as the Great GOD our SAVIOUR makes Over&s;eers or Bi&s;hops, and effectually calls his cho&s;en People, <HI>by his Spirit, Act.</HI> xx. 28. <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 5, 6. He promis'd that the HOLY GHOST, who is al&s;o a Divine Per&s;on, &s;hould be &s;ent from the Father in vertue of his Interce&s;&s;ion, and that <HI>to abide with his People for ever,</HI> Joh. xiv. 16, 17. Upon the whole, we may conclude, that our LORD JESUS CHRIST continueth to call and &s;end forth Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters.</P>

And here give me leave to offer a few Hints.</P>
<P>Let there be a Compendium or Summary of Chri&s;tian Religion agreable to the Scriptures, and as &s;hort and plain as may be, often inculcated, till the Natives &s;hall have learned the <HI>Prin|ciples of the Doctrine of CHRIST.</HI> Declare to them the only true and living GOD, who made Heaven and Earth, and all things in them; and that He made Man upright, in His own Image. Shew them their vile and mi&s;erable State by the Fall. Declare to them that this GOD, who is the FATHER and the SON and the HOLY GHOST, hath contriv'd a way in which they may be deliver'd from their Sin and Mi&s;ery. That in order to this, the Eternal SON of GOD hath taken our Nature, and became Man; that He was obedient to Death, the Death of the Cro&s;s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> again from the Dead, and lives in Heaven to intercede for his People. Declare to them, that this JESUS is the only Mediator between GOD and Man; and that they mu&s;t pray to GOD in His Name only. Shew them the nece&s;&s;ity of turning from all Sin to GOD in true Repentance; and of receiving the LORD JESUS CHRIST by Faith, and depending on His Righteou&s;ne&s;s for Pardon and Ju&s;tification. Declare to them that GOD alone hath power to forgive Sins. Shew them the nature and u&s;e of the holy Sacraments, and that tho&s;e which CHRIST hath in&s;tituted are only two, <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper;</HI> and la|bour to maintain in them an high e&s;teem of them. Shew them that they mu&s;t be taught the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and &s;ubject them&s;elves to the Authority and Laws of CHRIST, before the&s;e may be admini&s;tred to them: That if they would receive &s;aving benefit by <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> they mu&s;t al&s;o &s;eek the wa&s;hing of Regeneration, and renewing of the HOLY GHOST, for them&s;elves and their Offspring, that being born of Water and of the Spirit they may enter into the Kingdom of GOD. Teach them that the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> mu&s;t be receiv'd by the Communicants in both Elements, Bread and Wine; and that 'tis contrary to Sen&s;e Rea&s;on and Scripture, to imagine, that the&s;e are turn'd into the very Body and Blood of CHRIST&punc; and therefore that CHRIST, who is &s;piritually pre&s;ent with his People, mu&s;t be apprehended and received by faith, if they would partake in the &s;aving virtues of his Death. And take heed you never pro&s;titute the&s;e Sacred My&s;teries of our holy Religion, by admini&s;tring them to any under Hea|then Ignorance, under Romi&s;h Idolatry, or that live and allow them&s;elves in open and &s;candalous Immoralities.</P>
<P>Declare to them the Commandments of the <HI>Moral Law.</HI> That GOD only is the Object of Prayer, and all religious Wor&s;hip. Tell them, fora&s;much as we are the Offspring of GOD, we ought not to think that the God-Head is like unto Gold, or Silver or Stone, graven by art, and Man's device: that it is

a mo&s;t hainous Crime to wor&s;hip GOD by Images; and that He who is a jealous GOD, threatens to puni&s;h this Iniquity upon Parents and their Children, unto the third and fourth Genera|tion.

<P>[However, I am inform'd that tho' they have a Name for GOD, yet they have no form of taking his Name in vain, in their own Language. Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O ye Heavens, and be horribly afraid! in that this pre&s;umptuous Sin of profane Swearing is &s;o common where the light of the Go&s;pel &s;hines, and GOD's glorious and fearful Name is clearly reveal'd&punc; And let &s;uch bold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors know, that it will be more tolerable for bar|barous Indians than for them, in the Day of Judgment; when the LORD &s;hall make it appear, that He <HI>will not hold them guiltle&s;s that take his Name in vain.</HI>]</P>
<P>But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion; Declare to them, that GOD alone can change their Hearts, enable them to hate Sin, and love his Law; and then direct them to ask of GOD His HOLY SPIRIT, to &s;anctify them, and create them in CHRIST JESUS unto good Works. And &s;hew them that when they have done all, they mu&s;t Tru&s;t in the Merits of JESUS CHRIST, and not pre&s;ume to think that they can merit by their good Works. But I forbear.</P>
<P>In your teaching, there mu&s;t be precept upon precept, line upon line; here a little, and there a little. But how much skill and prudence do you need in this matter? Depend on GOD for all, and encourage your &s;elves in Him, who &s;aid on the fir&s;t Day, <HI>Let there be Light, and there was Light;</HI> and can now more ea&s;ily &s;hine into their Hearts to give them the knowledge of the Go&s;pel, than you can &s;peak a word.

<P>But think it not &s;trange, if you meet with &s;harp Trials from the Prince of Darkne&s;s, and &s;uch as are under his power, while you are endeavouring to enlighten Men with the know|ledge of JESUS CHRIST; and be ready to endure hard|ne&s;s,

<Q><P>KNOW then,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See a printed Account of <HI>the Society in Scotland.</HI> 1720.</NOTE> that in the Year of our LORD 1701. a Number of private <HI>Gentlemen</HI> did u&s;ually meet in the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for the Reformation of Manners; who reflecting on the Ignorance, Athei&s;m, Popery and Impiety, that did &s;o much abound in the <HI>High-lands</HI> and <HI>I&s;les</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> did ju&s;tly reckon that they flow'd in a great Mea&s;ure from the Want of &s;utable Means of In&s;truction.</P>
<P>THIS led 'em to engage by them&s;elves at fir&s;t in a volun|tary Sub&s;cription for Erecting <HI>Charity Schools</HI> in tho&s;e Places of Darkne&s;s and Irreligion. But upon Trial finding Them|&s;elves not able in their private Capacity to carry on &s;o great and publick a Work, they apply'd their Thoughts to find out Methods for a <HI>Fund</HI> equal to the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of this they mov'd it privately to Members of the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> that the Repre&s;entatives of <HI>the Church of Scotland</HI> might concur in the Work. And they had &s;o much Succe&s;s that in the Year 1706. the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> took it under Con&s;ideration, and recommended it to their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> who publi&s;hed <HI>Propo&s;als for the Propagating of Chri&s;tian Knowledge</HI> in their High-lands and I&s;les, and al&s;o in Foreign Parts.</P>

To this it &s;eems in a great mea&s;ure owing, that the <HI>Religion of</HI> CHRIST has not made a much farther Pro|gre&s;s in the <HI>Ea&s;tern Hemi&s;phere,</HI> than it had about 1400 Years ago, in the Days of CONSTANTINE the <HI>Great.</HI> Whereas had <HI>this Order of Mini&s;ters,</HI> from tho&s;e ancient Times been con|&s;tantly kept up and emitted among the <HI>Heathen Nations;</HI> by the common Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, it &s;eems to be likely, that <HI>all the Ends of the Earth,</HI> in a far more exten&s;ive Sen&s;e than <HI>Eu|&s;ebius</HI> is to be taken, had long before now been <HI>Evangeliz'd,</HI> and happily &s;een the Salvation of GOD.</P>
<P>Nor can I imagine, that the Reformed and famous <HI>Churches,</HI> either of FRANCE or SCOTLAND ever intended to militate <HI>this &s;ort of Officers</HI> thus de&s;cribed: For tho' They di&s;countenance a <HI>Vagous Mini&s;try</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Quick's <HI>Synodicon, &amp;</HI> Steuart's <HI>Collections</HI></NOTE>; I pre&s;ume they only mean in <HI>tho&s;e Parts of the World,</HI> where the People are <HI>Chri&s;tianized</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> gathered.</P>
<P N="2">(2) From hence we likewi&s;e plainly &s;ee, that EVANGELISTS, or Preachers of the Go&s;pel and Gatherers of Churches among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> are <HI>much more properly and &s;trictly,</HI> the SUCCESSORS of the APOSTLES, than the <HI>&s;tated Bi&s;hops</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> of particu|lar Churches: the Office of the <HI>former</HI> much more re&s;embling that of the APOSTLES, than the Office of the <HI>latter.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="43" REF="003723_0048_10024B6923EF5358">
(3) and la&s;tly, The&s;e EVANGELISTS thus Preaching among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> Converting and Baptizing them, Gathering them into Churches and then Con&s;tituting <HI>&s;tated Bi&s;hops</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> over them; They, the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> cannot therefore po&s;&s;ibly be an Inferiour Order of Officers to tho&s;e <HI>Stated Bi&s;hops</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> whom&punc; They thus &s;et over the Churches&punc; They have con|verted and gathered. Tho' their Ordaining &s;uch <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> will on the other hand no more infer a Superiority in the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts;</HI> than <HI>one Stated Bi&s;hop</HI> of a Church ordain|ing <HI>another Bi&s;hop,</HI> will infer a Superiority in the <HI>Ordainer.</HI></P>
<P>And for your farther Satisfaction in the &s;trict Propriety of <HI>Laying our Hands</HI> upon, and <HI>Giving the Right Hand of Fellow|&s;hip</HI> to <HI>&s;uch &s;ort of Officers</HI> as have been now ordained; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve the&s;e Two things&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">(1) That they were <HI>&s;uch &s;ort of Officers,</HI> upon whom HANDS WERE LAID in the primitive Times, when they were &s;eparated to this peculiar Service.</P>
<P>Thus we read of BARNABAS an EVANGELIST, as well as of PAUL an APOSTLE, in <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 1,&mdash;3. <HI>Now there were in the Church that was at</HI> Antioch, <HI>certain Prophets and Teachers</HI>&mdash;<HI>as they mini&s;tred to the</HI> LORD, <HI>and fa&s;ted, the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>&s;aid,</HI> SEPARATE <HI>me</HI> BARNABAS <HI>and</HI> SAUL <HI>for the Work whereto I have called them: and when they had fa&s;ted and prayed, and</HI> LAID THEIR HANDS <HI>on them, they &s;ent them away.</HI> And &s;o were the <HI>Hands of the Presbytery</HI> laid on TIMOTHY, another EVANGELIST, when the <HI>Gift</HI> of Preaching the Go&s;pel, which was at fir&s;t among the <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Heathen,</HI> was communicated to Him. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 14.</P>
<P N="2">(2) That they were al&s;o <HI>&s;uch &s;ort of Officers,</HI> to whom the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> gave the RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP; when they were going to Preach among the <HI>Heathen.</HI></P>
<P>So the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf a&s;&s;ures us, in <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 9. <HI>And when</HI> JAMES, CEPHAS <HI>and</HI> JOHN, <HI>who &s;eemed to be</HI> PILLARS, <HI>perceived the Grace that was given to</HI> ME; <HI>they gave to</HI> ME <HI>and</HI> BARNABAS <HI>the</HI> RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP; <HI>that</HI> WE <HI>&s;hould go to the</HI> HEATHEN <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And thus we &s;ee that the <HI>Scripture In&s;tances</HI> both of <HI>Impo&s;ition of Hands</HI> and Giving the <HI>Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip,</HI> are <HI>fir&s;tly</HI> in Favour of <HI>Such &s;ort</HI> of Officers; and are by <HI>Inference</HI> or <HI>Imi|tation</HI> only, applied to <HI>Others.</HI></P>

But how extreamly <HI>agreable</HI> is the <HI>la&s;t mention'd</HI> primitive INSTANCE, to the <HI>Ca&s;e before us!</HI></P>
<P>For be&s;ides, that tho&s;e <HI>Five</HI> Mini&s;ters were then at JERUSA|LEM, the <HI>Seat</HI> of the principal Chri&s;tian Church in that Age and Part of the World; from whence were <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;ent con|tinually to Preach the Go&s;pel and gather Churches in all the Countries round about:&mdash;What I would chiefly ob&s;erve is&mdash;(1) That this was done upon their <HI>Perceiving the</HI> GRACE <HI>of</HI> GOD given to <HI>Paul</HI> as well as <HI>Barnabas</HI>&mdash;i. e. not only the Mini&s;terial Gifts and Graces of the HOLY SPIRIT, but al&s;o their evident Call of GOD to engage in this Office, and their un|que&s;tionable Inve&s;titure therein. (2) That this was done at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">arting of the&s;e Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> among the GENTILES, while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mini&s;ters were to continue to Preach among the <HI>Jews.</HI> (3) That tho' they were all inve&s;ted equally with the Mini|&s;terial Office; yet now at their Parting, <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> who were <HI>Prior</HI> in the Mini&s;try and <HI>&s;eem'd to be</HI> PILLARS; i. e. were &s;o con|&s;picuous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Chri&s;tian Church, as they were every where known and own'd as <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of CHRIST, and were al&s;o to remain among the <HI>Jews,</HI> if not in or near <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>&mdash;were tho't mo&s;t proper to <HI>Give</HI> the <HI>Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip</HI> to Tho&s;e who were going to a greater Di&s;tance and among another People.</P>
<P>And from the&s;e Ob&s;ervables we may now ea&s;ily collect the &s;ingular INTENTION of the&s;e wi&s;e and in&s;pired Mini&s;ters in <HI>this Significant Action.</HI> For no doubt They meant thereby&mdash;(1) To te&s;tify their Approbation of them as <HI>true Mini&s;ters</HI> of CHRIST, both duly qualified for this Sacred Office, rightly called to it, and inve&s;ted and employed in it; that all might own them as &s;uch, and none di&s;pute their Mini&s;terial Power.
