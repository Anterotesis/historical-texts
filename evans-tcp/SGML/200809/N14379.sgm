<HEAD>To Mr. Mather.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the &s;ubject before us is the common &s;alvation, I take li|berty to lay a&s;ide your addition, as that which no way be|longs to the point in controver&s;y, and con&s;ider my&s;elf as on a per|fect level with you, (your &s;uperiority in years excepted, to which I mean ever to have a due regard) that I may write with that free|dom and plaine&s;s, that becomes one, contending for a truth, which I judge, of equal importance to all the de&s;cendants from apo&s;tate Adam. I remember to have heard this ob&s;ervation, that while we are attempting to pull down our neighbour's one idol, we are in danger of &s;etting up two of our own; but I hope I am not &s;o ignorant of the pride of the human heart, and the devices of the grand adver&s;ary, as to think my&s;elf not equally liable with others engaged in controver&s;ial writings, to contend for victory and triumph, rather than truth; and of being influenced by the vanity of my carnal mind, rather than the meekne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of Chri&s;t. To him who is able to keep me from falling into the condemnation of the devil, I now commit my&s;elf, and proceed to the remarks propo&s;ed; may they be made with that meekne&s;s that becomes the man who fears God, loves his truth, doth not de&s;pi&s;e, but love his neighbour.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the many objections I have again&s;t your performance, I mu&s;t acknowledge there are &s;ome things in it that ju&s;tly demands one's attention, in the premonition to the reader; your bringing up to view, Matthew 7, 13, 14, the exhortation to enter into the &s;traight gate&mdash;and to beware of fal&s;e prophets; was very agreeable as you pre&s;ent it to view&mdash;"as coming from the great light of the world, the only and true way to God and hap|pine&s;s;" and it &s;ixed my tho'ts the more, as it is a pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture that has many years engaged me in the inquiring what is the true

import of it, as not knowing but that I might profit by your inter|pretations thereof, which indeed did not appear &s;atisfactory to my mind, more than any thing that I had been before acquainted with; therefore I &s;et my &s;elf to inquire into the meaning of tho&s;e words of the Lord and Saviour, with other parts of the divine word, by compairing &s;cripture with &s;cripture, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is undoubtedly the be&s;t, and is its own interpreter.&mdash;When I con&s;ider Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as made under the law, and &s;peaking as under the law to tho&s;e that were al&s;o under it, and that it was his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ign to manife&s;t him&s;elf as the true Me&s;&s;iah&punc; the antitype of what took place under that di&s;pen&s;ation, I apprehend in this exhortation he has the &s;ame thing in view, and &s;peaks of him&s;elf as the antitype of what was &s;aid of the gate in the old te&s;tament &s;criptures; perhaps in Ezekiel chap 43, 4 &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 4.2.3. and 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 19, which pa&s;&s;ages were they well under&s;tood, perhaps would illu&s;trate this matter; but I &s;hall only take notice of what is &s;aid in p&s;alm 11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.19, 20, where the Me&s;&s;iah is brought in, &s;aying, <HI>open to me the gates of righteou&s;ne&s;s; I will go in to them and prai&s;e the Lord; this gate of the Lord, into which the righteous &s;hall enter.</HI>&mdash;Here we have the mediator in virtue of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, calling for the opening the gates of righte+ou&s;ne&s;s, which may be illu&s;trated by <HI>John</HI> 10 2. <HI>he that en|ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th by the door is the &s;hepherd of the &s;heep, and he enters the gate of righteou&s;ne&s;s as head of his body.</HI>&mdash;By his own righteou&s;|ne&s;s, his perfect obedience to the law and his full &s;atisfaction to divine ju&s;tice, in which the father is well plea&s;ed: So entering by him, is entering into the &s;traight gate, into the narrow way, the only way leading to life; Je&s;us Chri&s;t admitts no competitor, no rival with him; nothing to be made mention of, but his righteou&s;|ne&s;s and his only; not meerely for the entrance into the gate; but all along the narrow way, and &s;o jealous is he of his honor, that he allows of no &s;ubjection to any other lord;&mdash;this appears to me, the mo&s;t likely meaning of the &s;traight gate and narrow way, which it is manife&s;t there be but few that find; as it is natural for us all in &s;ome way or other be&s;ides him, to go about to e&s;tabli&s;h our own righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;eek to enter in thereby which though many &s;eek thus to enter, they never &s;hall be able; (for eminently he is the way, the truth and the life) whil&s;t the body of the Jew|i&s;h nation were &s;eeking righteou&s;ne&s;s by the works of the law, the Lord lets them know the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was about to ri&s;e up and that the door of that di&s;pen&s;ation; and when he &s;hall have &s;o don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their knocking and pleading, what they had been done and

How|ever, it is the truth as it is in Je&s;us the &s;aviour our God and worthy of all acceptation." And in page 14. line 8 from the top, you &s;ay, "if the words be ju&s;tly tran&s;lated the &s;en&s;e will be, there is one God and one mediator of God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and &s;o it &s;ignifies that the mediator is both God and man;&mdash; but we note, that the learned <HI>Bitterfield,</HI> has propo&s;ed this tran&s;la|tion of the words, which it mu&s;t be owned an&s;wers word for word to the Greek;&mdash;the one God, the one who is al&s;o mediator of God and man, is the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; &s;o then the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who is the mediator, is God as well as man, &s;o that he is God and man united." The above quotation is what &s;trikes my mind with &s;atisfaction, as the truth as it is in Je&s;us the &s;aviour our God; and were I capaci|tated to recommend them to every ones con&s;ideration I would do it&mdash;though I cannot, I dare not, for any other paragraph in your whole performance;&mdash;and what follows immediately here|upon, is as &s;hocking as that quotation was plea&s;ing; to which you add, "but although this mediator has given him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all; for it mu&s;t be granted that he has given a &s;ufficient ran&s;om and propitiation for all; and he will not ca&s;t abroad any, who pe|nitently come to him as he requires, to gain and enjoy the benefit of it; yet it is no where &s;aid, that they who will not come to him for life and happine&s;s &s;hall enjoy the benefit of his ran&s;om and propitiation;"&mdash;the &s;um of which is, that though our &s;aviour be God and has given him&s;elf a ran&s;om, a &s;ufficient ran&s;om and pro|pitiation for all, yet it depends upon the will of man, whether any &s;hall enjoy the benefits of it;&mdash;I would a&s;k you &s;ir?
