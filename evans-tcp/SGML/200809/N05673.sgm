<P>ALTHOUGH by Providence it be alotted to me, for the mo&s;t Part, to preach the Word of God in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Tongue, notwith&s;tanding it doth &s;ometimes happen, that it is required of me to do it in <HI>Eng|li&s;h.</HI>&mdash;As it is the Duty of every faithful Pa&s;tor, to lay Hold on all Occa&s;ions that appear in any wi&s;e conducive to promote <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>real Re|ligion</HI> among Mankind, without any Di&s;tinction of what People, Language or Nation &s;oever: I would not neglect, in the late War, when I had on Lord's Days preached twice in <HI>Dutch</HI> to my own Flock, to preach a third Sermon in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to the Companies of Soldiers intended to defend us again&s;t the A&s;&s;aults of the Enemy, who at that Time were without <HI>Urim</HI> or <HI>Thum|mim,</HI> without Prie&s;t or Levite, to &s;hew them the Way of the Lord.</P>
<P>The <HI>New-England</HI> Gentlemen, as they have yet &s;omething left of the Religion of their pious and venerable Ance&s;tors, were the Per&s;ons who at that Time pre&s;&s;ed me to what is mentioned, by their Remon&s;trances, that they, de&s;iring to hear God's Word, and not under&s;tanding the <HI>Dutch Tongue,</HI> appealed to my Con&s;cience, whether, as Providence had &s;o ordered, that I had learnt &s;omething of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I could &s;uffer them to be de&s;titute of the Means of Grace, as Sheep that have no Shepherd?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, from the &s;ame Quarters of our Land, were they, who, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> TREATY and CONGRESS, de&s;ired me to preach in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in our Church: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the following is one of the <HI>Sermons</HI> I delivered on that Occa&s;ion; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> greater Number of Gentlemen of Note and Di&s;tinction in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> had been &s;een in it before.&mdash;</P>

<P>AS a merciful God, the Creator, and &s;upreme Governor of the Univer&s;e, ever regards the Inhabitants of this earthly Globe, with an Eye of Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion; &s;o doth he, for the mo&s;t Part, give timely Notice of tho&s;e Judgments he intends to inflict on guilty Mortals; to the End, that by Repentance his Ire may be appea&s;ed, or his Cha&s;ti&s;ements be the more ju&s;t and equitable.&mdash;Would I recall former Ages, and &s;et before you the State of Man's Innocence, in the happy <HI>Eden:</HI> Know ye not God gave our fir&s;t Parents to under&s;tand what would be the dreadful Con&s;equences of their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: What Ruin, what De&s;truction, what Mi&s;ery it would enhance upon them&s;elves and their Progeny? Do ye not think God &s;ent his holy Angels, tho&s;e cele&s;tial Mini&s;ters, of which there are Thou|&s;ands of Thou&s;ands before his Throne, to forewarn the human Pair of their Dan|ger, on Account of the Fall of Satan, with his apo&s;tate Crew? Or if this be Matter of Doubt to you, give me Leave to &s;peak of <HI>Enoch,</HI> the Seventh from <HI>Adam,</HI> who prophe&s;ied; <HI>Behold the Lord cometh with Ten Thou&s;ands of his Saints, to execute Judg|ment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly Deeds&punc; which they have ungodly committed; and of all their hard Speeches, which un|godly Sinners have &s;poken again&s;t him.</HI> Did&s;t thou not, <HI>O Enoch,</HI> before the Gates of Heaven were expanded unto thee, before exulting Spirits e&s;corted thee above yonder &s;parkling Orbs, exhort thy Cotemporaries? Ye Men of Renown, ye bulky Giants, think not Heaven is regardle&s;s of you, or your Thoughts, Words and Deeds: As ye hunt after Men, your own Fle&s;h and Blood, &s;o &s;hall God Almighty pur&s;ue and overtake you.

look how the cele&s;tial Luminaries begin to contract a &s;ad and gloomy A&s;pect, lurid and dim; frowning a Tempe&s;t of Vengeance: Repent therefore, or you are lo&s;t, ye huge Mortals!&mdash;Happy, had they harkened unto him! But whil&s;t they fall upon him, God takes him away: Ble&s;&s;ed Me&s;&s;engers, &s;natch him to milder Climes, to happier and more ho&s;pitable Regions!&mdash;And what &s;hall I &s;ay of thee, O <HI>Noah,</HI> thou Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; what Scoffs, what Sneers, what Revilings ha&s;t thou &s;uffered of thy Fellow-Labourers? Did not Men reproach both thee and thy Ark, <HI>Madman, what meane&s;t then by this Wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k;</HI> though afterwards, in vain, they &s;tretched out their Arms to Heaven, to be in it? <HI>Elijah</HI> the Prophet, was he not zealous for his God; and did he not prote&s;t again&s;t the Wor&s;hippers of <HI>Baal?</HI> And thou <HI>Jonah,</HI> Son of <HI>Amittai,</HI> wa&s;t thou not con&s;trained to preach and to cry again&s;t <HI>Nineveh,</HI> that great City, becau&s;e her Wickedne&s;s was come up before God in Heaven, though unto thee a hard Ta&s;k; unto them, of ble&s;&s;ed Con&s;equence, and &s;alutary Effect?</P>
<P>In this Manner, is al&s;o <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> a Prophet, who &s;aw the Vi&s;ions of the Almighty, &s;ent to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> an untoward and &s;tiff necked People, to reclaim them from their Back|&s;lidings and Prevarications, to the Service of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the eternal and mo&s;t High. Hereunto he was formed in the Womb; hereunto he was &s;anctified from his Infancy: The Charge &s;eemed to him too great; the Burthen appeared to him too weighty for his juvinile Shoulders. Ah! Lord, &s;aid he, <HI>behold I cannot &s;peak, for I am a Youth.</HI> Who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e Things? It is a Work that, without the corroborating Influences of thy Holy Spirit, without Aid and Succour from above, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nk be|neath its Weight, one of the mighty Cherubim. But God, with whom is the Re&s;i|due of the Spirit, in&s;pires him with Life and Courage, and Magnanimity of Soul: And having in the preceding Chapter, commanded him to prophe&s;y, concerning <HI>Judah'</HI>s Captivity, &s;hews him in this, the ab&s;olute Power with which God is inve&s;ted in di&s;po&s;ing of Nations, under the Type of a Potter, from thence to exhort <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to return unto the Lord, from whom they were apo&s;tatized mo&s;t ungratefully.</P>
<P>So that the Words of my Text contains this important Truth; That as &s;incere Penitence is a Means of averting an imminent and denounced Evil, from a Nation or People; &s;o Impiety and Irreligion is the Way to forego all the good Ble&s;|&s;ings, which otherwi&s;e might have been expected: And that to declare this, is the Province of God's faithful Servants, in order to reclaim vicious Mortals from &s;inning again&s;t God, to a Cour&s;e of real Religion and Piety.</P>
<P>The Fitne&s;s and Propriety of this Matter to be now treated upon, in our pre&s;ent Situation of Affairs, I hope you will ob&s;erve, my &s;en&s;ible and intelligent Hearers; whereas the pre&s;ent Time is a critical Juncture, in which we are to with&s;tand, re|&s;i&s;t, and oppo&s;e our ambitious rivalling Neighbours, in their Encroachments upon our Borders.</P>
<P><HI>O Lord, do thou clean&s;e us from our Dro&s;s; do thou &s;end a Spirit of genuine Repen|tance among us:&mdash;Should&s;t thou &s;earch us as</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>with Candles, our Back&s;lidings would appear too glaringly.&mdash;Heal us, O Lord, and we &s;hall be healed; &s;ave us, and we &s;hall be &s;aved.&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>In order to treat upon this Matter, I &s;hall, as to the Explication, take Notice of the&s;e three Things.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That when God threatens a Nation by an imminent Evil to its De&s;truction, true Repentance is a Means to avert the Evil, and to e&s;cape and avoid the impen|ding and denounced Ruin.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That when God promi&s;es Ble&s;&s;ings to a Nation; Irreligion, Impiety and Ungodline&s;s is a Means to ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r and forego all tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That it is the indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of God's faithful Servants, to declare this, in order to reclaim vicious Mortals from their wicked Way, unto the Fear and Service of the Lord.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t: <HI>At what In&s;tant,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, <HI>I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom; to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it:</HI> I con|ceive,
<PB N="3" REF="007199_0007_102B3AC7D14D65C8">
a Nation, a Kingdom, a People upon this Terraqueous Globe, ble&s;&s;ed by the beneign Deity, with the Enjoyment of tho&s;e Comforts which the State of Man's Pil|grimage in this mi&s;erable World affords; as Health, Peace and Plenty, Honour, Glory, Empire, and Pui&s;&s;ance: But which Nation, forgetful of the bounteous Benefactor from whom they derive the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, violates and contemns his Laws, de&s;pi&s;es his Ordinances, and lives in Impiety and Irreligion,&mdash;which draws over this Nation a gloomy Cloud, fraught with Heaven's Artillery, big with Indignation from on High; a portentous Interval, an awful Moment, and a dreadful In&s;tant, wherein God denounces his Puni&s;hments again&s;t a &s;inful People, threatning to de&s;troy them in a Storm of Vengeance.</P>
<P>And I take thee, O <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to be this Nation in particular: Thy God and thy Father's God led thee forth, by a mighty Hand and a &s;trong Arm, out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Place of thy Servitude, of thy ignominious Slavery; and placed thee in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> flowing with Milk and Honey.&mdash;Ye <HI>Canaanites,</HI> ye <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ites,</HI> ye <HI>Phari&s;ites, Amorites, Hevites,</HI> and <HI>Amalekites,</HI> ye were an Abomination unto the Lord, becau&s;e you wor&s;hipped accur&s;ed Idols, the Workman&s;hip of the Hands of Men, if not Devils; wherefore the God of Heaven and Earth, who is to be wor|&s;hipped in Spirit and in Truth, ca&s;t you out.

<P>Concerning a Nation and Kingdom, doth the Lord &s;peak by his holy Angels, his &s;wift Me&s;&s;engers, &s;ending them to forewarn and rebuke a &s;inful People. Re|member the Angel at <HI>Bochim,</HI> who upbraided you with your Di&s;obedience, O <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in &s;uch a tender Manner, that you wept for Grief, and lifted up your Voices for Compunction of Heart. <HI>Judg.</HI> II. 1, 5.

<P>The Lord doth &s;peak concerning a Nation, a Kingdom and People, by Signs and Tokens in the Heavens; by Comets and terrifying Stars, foreboding dreadful Calamities, doleful Afflictions and &s;ore Cha&s;ti&s;ements.

<P><HI>If now this Nation turn from their Evil, &s;aith the Lord, I will repent of the Evil I thought to do unto them.</HI> What is it then, O &s;inful Nation, the Lord requireth of thee? Is it not Repentance? Is it not to turn from your Evil?</P>

The Repentance of a Nation in general, is, when a Nation believing God's Threatnings, and humbling them|&s;elves before him by Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin, by Fa&s;ting and Prayer, and by other Ac|tions of Humiliation, endeavour a Reformation from the Vices they were guilty of, and to live in a Cour&s;e of oppo&s;ite Virtues.&mdash;Which general Repentance, it is to be hoped, in &s;ome may be &s;incere, and of a genuine Sort; but is to be &s;eared, that in many, and the greate&s;t Part, it is only &s;urperficial, and meerly external, not proceeding from a good internal Principle of Renovation and Regeneration:&mdash;Not|with&s;tanding it is often &s;o plea&s;ing in the Sight of God, that he thereon averts a de|nounced Evil, and for the pre&s;ent, &s;pares a People he had threatned with De&s;truc|tion.&mdash;I doubt not, O <HI>Ninevites,</HI> but your Repentance was, by &s;ome of you, genuine, and of a &s;alutary Nature; though at the &s;ame Time, I fear that, with the greate&s;t Part, it was but like the Morning Cloud, and like the early Dew which pa&s;&s;eth away.</P>
<P>This Turning from Evil, implies in it two Things; A for&s;aking of an evil Way, and a coming to a good One.</P>
<P>From an evil Way the Children of Men cannot turn, unle&s;s they &s;ee that evil Way: For Example, a Per&s;on who has mi&s;taken his Way, mu&s;t he not be made
<PB N="5" REF="007199_0009_102B3ACC9046F630">
&s;en&s;ible of his Error, before he will endeavour to rectify his Mi&s;take? Yonder I &s;ee a Stranger in this our City, who thinks he is going to Church; but behold, the Court-Hou&s;e or the Pri&s;on brings him up: He begins fir&s;t to doubt, whether he be right or not; then he believes he was wrong, &s;o he turns back to the Road which leads to the Church. He who &s;ails down a River, in order to come to a City that is &s;ituated from him up the River, unle&s;s he &s;ees him&s;elf &s;teering the wrong Cour&s;e, and rectifies his Mi&s;take, will never arrive at the intended Place. So a Per&s;on who becomes really penitent, and is bent on for&s;aking his Evil; his Eyes are opened to &s;ee his mi&s;erable Situation in an unrenewed State; his Sins are &s;et before him in all their aggravating Circum&s;tances and mo&s;t heinous Nature, for which he loathes and abhors him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His Con&s;cience is then awakned, and la&s;h'd with the Cur&s;es of God's Holy Law&punc; &s;o that thou, O Sinner, do&s;t complain within thy&s;elf,</P>

<P>Tell me, convinced Sinner, can now thy own Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;atisfy thee? Are not your be&s;t Performances an unclean Thing, and all your Righteou&s;ne&s;s as filthy Rags? Do they not all fade as a Leaf, and your Iniquities, like the Wind, take you away? Are not your Prayers and Devotions polluted with Sin, and your&s;elves &s;truck with loath&s;om Lepro&s;y, from the Crown of the Head unto the Sole of the Feet? Can you any more change your&s;elves, than the <HI>AEthiopian</HI> can change his Skin, or a <HI>Leopard</HI> his Spots?</P>
<P>Submit then, penitent Souls, &s;ubmit your&s;elves to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Sovereignty of God, acknowledging that even Tears from &s;uch Eyes might be of|fen&s;ive, and Prayers from &s;uch Lips abominable, compo&s;ing your&s;elves to lay the Hand upon the Mouth and be &s;ilent, &s;hould God inflict the mo&s;t dreadful Doom that can be executed; not as the accur&s;ed of God, uttering Bla&s;phemies again&s;t Heaven, but as relenting Lovers of the Deity re&s;olve&mdash;</P>

<P>Lord Je&s;us, &s;aith the humbled Soul, here is a mi&s;erable Sinner, who has de&s;er|ved Hell and De&s;truction, throws him&s;elf at thy Feet: Nothing have I to plead, &s;ave Mercy; and if Mercy do not &s;ave me I am lo&s;t; and &s;hould I peri&s;h, thou art ju&s;t; of this my Heart and Con&s;cience are inconte&s;tible Witne&s;&s;es; But if I die, let me die imploring thy Grace and Mercy, thy Pardon and Favour.</P>
<P>O now is the Way of Salvation laid open to a God-&s;eeing Soul! Je&s;us is both able and willing to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t. The atoning Blood of the immaculate Lamb of God, has Merits commen&s;urate with the Glories of the Divinity. O! a Di&s;covery this, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the Powers of Utterance! Never was a condemned Male|factor more affected by a Proclamation of Pardon, than the humbled Soul by the Tender of Salvation, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;Then do they receive him by Faith,

<P>And as a &s;incere Penitent, thus is delivered out of his &s;inful State, &s;o is he al&s;o brought over to a Way of Sanctity and Holine&s;s.&mdash;The Under&s;tanding becomes enlightned; the Will &s;anctified; the Con&s;cience rectified:&mdash;And is it not ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, that a good Tree produce good Fruit?

<P>When a Nation thus turns from their Evil, the Lord will repent of the Evil he thought to do unto them.&mdash;As for&s;aking God is the Cau&s;e of De&s;truction, &s;o would returning unto him, be a Means to avoid the Evil that was denounced; in which Re&s;pect God is &s;aid to repent:&mdash;Not as if he altered his eternal high Decree; no, he is an immutable God, and his Council &s;hall &s;tand firm for ever; and he doeth what&s;oever plea&s;eth him:&mdash;So that this Repentance in God, is to be under&s;tood in a Manner, becoming the Supreme Being; that is, with Relation to the external Di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providences, wherein he acts thus, That, when a Nation or People is become exceeding &s;inful, he denounces his Judgments again&s;t it, threat|ning it with De&s;truction; but upon Condition, they continue in their Di&s;obedience and Impiety: Which Condition is &s;ometimes more openly expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ometimes more &s;ecretly under&s;tood.&mdash;Ye Inhabitants of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> that great City, you exhibit us an Example of God's Dealings with the Children of Men.&mdash;<HI>Jonah</HI> the Prophet, was commi&s;&s;ioned from Heaven to declare your De&s;truction: He cried, and &s;aid, <HI>Yet Forty Days, and</HI> Nineveh <HI>&s;hall be over|thrown.</HI> But behold, upon your Repentance, though your Wickedne&s;s was come up before God in Heaven, the Lord &s;pared you.&mdash;When you believed God, and proclaimed a Fa&s;t, putting on Sackcloth, from the greate&s;t, even unto the lea&s;t of you: When your King, on hearing the Word of the Lord, ro&s;e from his Throne, laid his royal Robe from him, and covered him&s;elf with Sackcloth, and &s;at in A&s;hes; &s;aying, <HI>Let Man and Bea&s;t fa&s;t, let them be covered with Sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil Way, and from the Vio|lence that is in their Hands: Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce Anger, that we peri&s;h not?

<P>Ble&s;&s;ed is the In&s;tant, happy the Conjuncture when au&s;picious Heaven deigns to &s;mile on a favourite Nation, its peculiar Darling: Then are holy Angels a tutelar Safeguard in the Mid&s;t of it, and all around its Borders; evil Spirits, <HI>who wan|der to and fro, up and down the Earth, &s;eeking whom they may de&s;troy,</HI> are re&s;trained. The planetary Regions &s;hed forth benign Influences, to fo&s;ter and fructify tho&s;e Quarters of the Earth which are allotted to its Heritage: It multiplies and branches out into Ten Thou&s;ands Millions and Myriads; Health, Wealth, Honour and Gran|deur, dwell every where within its far and wide extended Limits; Peace and Plenty find a palladian Habitation within its Boundaries.&mdash;The Rulers are noble, great, wi&s;e and good Men, &s;incere Wor&s;hippers of the Deity; the People are loyal, ho|ne&s;t, frugal, benevolent, pious, fearing God, and e&s;chewing Evil: They become honourable to their Neighbours, worthy to their Allies, formidable to their Ene|mies, lovely to their God.&mdash;</P>
