<P>The&s;e debates afford a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect that Penn|&s;ylvania will, in proce&s;s of time, behold her &s;enate adorned with orators not inferior, perhaps, to tho&s;e boa&s;ts of antiquity&mdash;Demo&s;thenes, I&s;ocrates, Cicero, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following debates, the &s;ame arguments frequently occur twice, and, in &s;ome few in&s;tances, perhaps a third or fourth time. The editor anticipates a que&s;tion which will, doubtle&s;s, be a&s;ked by mo&s;t of the readers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Why, in tho&s;e ca&s;es, he has not re&s;ted &s;atisfied with the fir&s;t &s;tate|ment, and omitted the others?</Q> To this he an&s;wers, that when introduced again in the manner above mentioned, they are mo&s;tly con&s;idered in a different point of view, and &s;ome new lights thrown upon them. Moreover, the importance of the &s;ubject in&s;pired him with a de&s;ire of laying the debates before the public in as ample a manner as po&s;&s;ible. Still fur|ther: If he had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed any part of the member's &s;peech|es, he would have &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the charge of partia|lity, which he has &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavoured to avoid.</P>
<P>It will be remarked, that the an&s;wers to &s;ome of the ar|guments, &s;tate them differently from what they appear in the original &s;peeches. This has &s;ometimes ari&s;en from one member mi&s;taking the meaning of another: &s;ometimes, the fault lies with the editor.</P>
<P>As to omi&s;&s;ions, he mu&s;t be chargeable with them in va|rious places. He does not under&s;tand &s;hort hand, without which it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to keep pace with a &s;peaker, unle&s;s he delivers him&s;elf very lei&s;urely. However, he flat|ters him&s;elf that very few of the material arguments on ei|ther &s;ide, have e&s;caped him.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the defects or imperfections of the pamphlet, they will, he tru&s;ts, be readily excu&s;ed, when it is con&s;idered that his chief object has been to contribute to the information of the public, on a &s;ubject of as great magni|tude, perhaps, as any agitated in this &s;tate &s;ince the revolution.</P>

<HEAD>General A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, March</HI> 3, 1786, A. M.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A memorial &s;igned by 624 inhabitants of the city and liberties of Philadelphia, was pre&s;ented to the chair, and read as follows:</P>
<P>To the honourable the repre&s;entatives of the freemen of the commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania, in general a&s;&s;embly met,</P>
<P>IMPRESSED with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of freedom, and con&s;idering, as we ought, that an impar|tial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice is the fundamental principle of the con&s;titution, and that the &s;ecurity of property, be it lit|tle or much, or to whoever it may belong, is one of the chief ends of government: we conceive it to be our bounden duty to watch over the conduct of tho&s;e, whom our free &s;uffrages, as a free people, have entru&s;ted with the manage|ment of public affairs, &s;o as at all times to guard again&s;t a remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of duty, or a wanton or incautious exerci&s;e of power on their part.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed, we &s;ay, with the&s;e ideas and principles, we are led to &s;tate to this honourable hou&s;e, a matter, in which, as it appears on the printed minutes of the late hou&s;e of a&s;&s;em|bly, there has not been that proper and impartial attention paid, which the principles of the con&s;titution and the true end of government require.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e we refer to is as follows:</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of March la&s;t, petitions from &s;undry inha|bitants of Che&s;ter county were pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e and
<PB N="2" REF="019884_0005_0FAD40E88CE5FC98">
read. Tho&s;e petitions began by &s;tating a number of charges and allegations again&s;t the bank of North America, but with|out making or offering proof or evidence of their being true; and praying that the charter of &s;aid bank may be repealed.</P>
<P>On the 23d in the morning, two other petitions to the &s;ame purport were pre&s;ented and read for the fir&s;t time, and read again for the &s;econd time on the &s;ame day: whereupon, on motion made and &s;econded, they were referred to a com|mittee to enquire and report thereon.</P>
<P>We conceive it to be an indi&s;pen&s;ible principle, whenever the property of any of the citizens of this commonwealth is to be affected by the charges and allegations of any man or number of men, that the charges and allegations &s;hall be proved, and that the party &s;o charged and accu&s;ed &s;hall be heard in its defence; and that it is a departure from the principles of the con&s;titution, for the repre&s;entatives of the people to take any &s;uch charges and allegation as matters of truth, without proof or evidence of their being &s;o; and that for any hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly to proceed thereon, to the injury of the property of any of our fellow-citizens, without evi|dence had, and defence heard, is uncon&s;titutional, and that no law &s;o obtained or pa&s;&s;ed can be operative, becau&s;e it is repugnant to the principles of ju&s;tice and the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts are deeply concerned to have occa|&s;ion to ob&s;erve, (and as citizens are deeply intere&s;ted in the ob&s;ervation) that it does not appear, either from the report of the committee to whom the &s;aid petitions, charges, and allegations were committed, or from any other proceedings of the late hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, that any enquiry was made, or any proof or evidence had or produced of the &s;aid charges and allegations being true: yet the &s;aid hou&s;e proceeded to bring in a bill, which has in it the nature of a <HI>&s;entence,</HI> on the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> truth of the &s;aid charges and allegations, in&s;tead of enquiring into and a&s;certaining them by proof and evi|dence&mdash;the title of which bill is, <HI>An act to repeal an act of a&s;&s;embly, entitled,</HI> <Q>An act to incorporate the &s;ub&s;cribers to the bank of North America, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts are further concerned to ob&s;erve, that when the per&s;ons who&s;e property was immediately to be af|fected by the pa&s;&s;ing this bill into a law, applied by petition to be heard in their defence, and, of con&s;equence, again&s;t the &s;aid charges and allegations, on the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> truth of which, the afore&s;aid bill was &s;ounded: the &s;aid hou&s;e re|fu&s;ed
<PB N="3" REF="019884_0006_0FAD40E9555FC958">
to hear them, thereby denying them that right which every citizen of this commonwealth is entitled to.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts find by the printed minutes of the late hou&s;e, April 4th, that when the &s;aid bill was called up for a &s;econd reading, a motion was made by mr. Pettit, and &s;e|conded by mr. Willing, that the memorial of the pre&s;ident, directors, and company of the bank of North America, praying to be heard, be read; and on the que&s;tion that the prayer of the &s;aid memorial be granted, it was nega|tived. See April 4th, page 284.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts think it right to remark, that tho&s;e proceedings of the late hou&s;e&punc; and of their committee, afford a &s;trong pre&s;umption to many good citizens, that the charges and allegations again&s;t the bank are ill founded, and not true; and that other cau&s;es than tho&s;e which have been a&s;|&s;igned, are to be looked for&punc; as the true cau&s;es for the ve|hement attack on the bank.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts further find by the &s;aid printed mi|nutes (April 4th, p. 284) that immediately after the &s;aid prayer, "to be heard," was rejected, the hou&s;e went into the &s;econd reading of the &s;aid bill, without any enquiry into the truth of the charges and allegations afore&s;aid; and hav|ing fini&s;hed the &s;aid &s;econd reading, the bill, as is u&s;ual, was ordered to be publi&s;hed for public con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>On this part of the proceedings, your memoriali&s;ts con|ceive it their duty, as well as their right as citizens, to remark&mdash;</P>
<P>That the publi&s;hing the bill for the public to con&s;ider upon, without (the hou&s;e) having fir&s;t inve&s;tigated the charges and allegations again&s;t the bank, which were the moving cau&s;es of the proceedings of the hou&s;e, and on the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> truth of which the &s;aid bill was founded, and with|out hearing the defence of the parties &s;o charged and alleged again&s;t, was bringing the bill before the public in a very partial and incomplete manner; becau&s;e it was leaving the public in the dark as to the truth or exi&s;tence of the matters on which their con&s;ideration was to be exerci&s;ed; and with|holding from them the knowledge on which their judgment was to be formed. It was impo&s;&s;ible the public could, by any con&s;ideration of theirs, determine or know, whether the matters charged on the bank were true or fal&s;e. Con|&s;ideration has no proper object to go upon, when applied to charges without evidence, and &s;till le&s;s &s;o when applied to a &s;entence, without having both the evidence and the defence.
<PB N="4" REF="019884_0007_0FAD40EA19342218">
The bill, then ordered to be publi&s;hed, had in it the nature of a &s;entence, and nothing can appear to us more incon|&s;i&s;tent than the publi&s;hing a &s;entence for the con&s;ideration of the public, and for the purpo&s;e of obtaining the concur|rence or opinion of the public thereon, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the matters on which that &s;entence is founded.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts are much concerned to find &s;uch devi|ations from, if not direct violations of, the con&s;titution; and that within &s;o &s;hort a time after the late convention had pointed out defects of a &s;imilar nature in the conduct of for|mer a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts are further induced to ob&s;erve&mdash;that on the que&s;tion it&s;elf, re&s;pecting the repealing the charter of the bank, they feel them&s;elves under &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations and apprehen&s;ions. At any rate, it is breaking the word and promi&s;e of the &s;tate, publicly pledged but a &s;hort time before&mdash;a mea&s;ure, which at fir&s;t view holds out to the world a faithle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition in Penn&s;ylvania, and puts all kind of credit, public and private, on a precarious footing&mdash;a mea&s;ure, of which the power to do it may be litigated, be|cau&s;e it may be made a que&s;tion, whether any law can war|rant the doing an unlawful thing. Therefore the repealing a charter, being a &s;tep of the utmo&s;t delicacy and danger, requires to be gone into with the nice&s;t care, and the mo&s;t cautious and &s;crupulous inve&s;tigation. If any cau&s;es can ju&s;|tify &s;uch proceeding, tho&s;e cau&s;es ought to be made vi&s;ible to the world, or our credit with the world is wounded, if not ended. For, who will tru&s;t a government that a&s;&s;umes the power of breaking its word, or will tru&s;t the individuals of a country that live under &s;uch a government? The paper money of one hou&s;e may be voted down by the next; and the engagements of one a&s;&s;embly be &s;uperceded by its &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors. It will be of little u&s;e to us afterwards, to &s;ay, that any number or party of the a&s;&s;embly, were the per&s;ons who did it. Tho&s;e per&s;ons may be returned to the rank of private citizens, or departed the &s;tate, when the mi&s;chiefs they &s;hall have occa&s;ioned, &s;hall take place.</P>
<P>But your memoriali&s;ts are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that in|&s;tead of caution and inve&s;tigation, in&s;tead of preci&s;ion and deliberation, they find the bu&s;ine&s;s taken up on the &s;lighte&s;t grounds, and conducted with a &s;pirit of ha&s;te and precipi|tancy extremely ill-&s;uited to the nature and importance of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019884_0008_0FAD40EADD5049A8">
Your memoriali&s;ts find by the printed minutes of the late hou&s;e, that the petitions again&s;t the bank were read twice in the &s;ame day, referred to a committee to enquire and report thereon, and the report of that committee delivered in, not the very next day, but the day after,&mdash;That report read a fir&s;t and &s;econd time, debated and re&s;olved upon, and a &s;econd committee appointed to bring in a bill, and that bill brought in and read, and all this within the &s;pace of &s;ix days, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from the 23d to the 29th of March; for the truth of which we refer to the printed minutes of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the exten&s;ive nature of the ca&s;e, the variety of knowledge nece&s;&s;ary to collect, to form a judg|ment upon, and the probable danger of &s;uch a proceeding to public and private credit, we mu&s;t declare upon our own knowledge and opinion of the nature of the &s;ubject, that neither the time, nor the attention be&s;towed, was equal to the importance of it.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts find, that the late hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly hav|ing neglected to enquire into the truth of the charges and allegations again&s;t the bank, and yet taken up the&s;e charges and allegations as true, refu&s;ing at the &s;ame time to grant the prayer of the proprietors of the bank to be heard in their defence, publi&s;hed the afore&s;aid bill, for, what is call|ed, public con&s;ideration, and adjourned &s;oon after to the 23d of Augu&s;t following.</P>
<P>As the &s;aid bill, during the rece&s;s of the hou&s;e, was be|fore the public in the imperfect &s;tate we have already menti|oned, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the public to form any judgment upon it, becau&s;e the facts and matters on which they were to judge, were withheld from them, and therefore the publica|tion of it could not an&s;wer the purpo&s;es intended by the con|&s;titution: But if any judgment is to be formed from the ge|neral elections which took place &s;oon after the pa&s;&s;ing this bill, we may conclude it met with great di&s;approbation, be|cau&s;e &s;o many of the members who voted for it, have been di&s;placed by their con&s;tituents; and we cannot doubt that as this dark&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s comes to be better known, and more illuminated, and the true intere&s;t of Penn&s;ylvania fuller un|der&s;tood, that a more exten&s;ive reprobation will take place; for it is natural that a free people &s;hould abhor the reproach of being a faithle&s;s one, and impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould counte|nance a mea&s;ure which has the appearance of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts find, that on the meeting of the late hou&s;e for their la&s;t &s;itting, on the 23d of Augu&s;t, the pre&s;i|dent, directors and company of the bank of North-America,
<PB N="6" REF="019884_0009_0FAD40EB88C44EF8">
renewed their application to the hou&s;e for a hearing; and that a petition from eight per&s;ons, (&s;igners to the petitions for repealing the charter of the bank) <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> James Pear&s;on, Robert Smith, William Graham, John Barker, John Kling, George Leib, Levi Budd, and Frederick Heimberger, was likewi&s;e pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e, praying to be heard in &s;up|port of their petitions, both which reque&s;ts were complied with.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts find by the minutes of the late hou&s;e, page 356, that on the fifth of September, the day appointed by the hou&s;e for a hearing, the pre&s;ident of the bank pre|&s;ented him&s;elf per&s;onally at the bar of the hou&s;e, and like|wi&s;e by coun&s;el; but it does not appear from the &s;aid mi|nutes, that any of the per&s;ons who had &s;igned the petitions, charges and allegations again&s;t the bank, appeared per&s;onally to &s;upport and prove them; neither does it appear that they produced &s;o much as a &s;ingle evidence to prove what they had &s;igned to, or attempted to prove it.</P>
<P>If therefore they have &s;igned to charges and allegations which are not true, and the hou&s;e have acted on tho&s;e char|ges and allegations as if they were true, there is a manife&s;t injury committed; and as reparation is due to the injured, as well as to the injured honor of the &s;tate, your memorial|i&s;ts confide that this hon. hou&s;e will take &s;uch mea&s;ures as may make the nece&s;&s;ary reparation.</P>
<P>The charges and allegations on the part of the petitioners again&s;t the bank, not being attempted to be proved, the bank could only deny them; and we find by the minutes of the hou&s;e, that the matter ended in a verbal litigation be|tween a coun&s;el on each &s;ide, in&s;tead of going into an inve&s;|tigation and proof of the charges advanced, on the &s;uppo&s;ed truth of which the hou&s;e had acted.</P>
<P>On this part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, your memoriali&s;ts think it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the refu&s;ing the bank a hearing in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, before the bill was publi&s;hed for public con&s;ideration, and admitting the bank to a hear|ing at the very latter part of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, was precluding the judgment of the public upon the ca&s;e, becau&s;e the publication of the bill, and the time for public con&s;ideration, was pa&s;&s;ed; and no new matter which any hearing at that time might pro|duce, could have time or opportunity to be publicly known.</P>
<P>Had the hearing been before the &s;econd reading of the bill, and con&s;equently before it was to be publi&s;hed for public con&s;ideration, which was the reque&s;t the bank made, the
<PB N="7" REF="019884_0010_0FAD40EE089C9AE8">
public would then have known, that the petitioners again&s;t the bank had not proved their charges and allegations; and this would have been matter for the public to have exerci&s;ed their con&s;ideration and judgment upon: but of this they were precluded by their repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>That the charges and allegations again&s;t the bank are ill-grounded and not true&punc; is naturally to be inferred from their not being proved nor attempted to be proved&mdash;And that the prayer of the petitioners again&s;t the bank is founded on very ill and dangerous principles, &s;ubver&s;ive of the good of &s;ociety, and of the fundamentals of the con&s;titution, and of all true government, is be&s;t inferred from the prayer it&s;elf, which we here &s;ubjoin:</P>
<P>"Therefore," &s;ay the petitioners, <Q>in order to re&s;tore public confidence and private &s;ecurity, we pray, that a bill may be brought in, and pa&s;&s;ed into a law, for repeal|ing the law for incorporating the bank.</Q>&mdash;On which we remark, that nothing can be more dangerous in principle and practice, and more ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous, than to pray that the government may break its word, in order to be the better believed and tru&s;ted, and violate the confidence al|ready placed in it, in order that the people may place more: yet &s;uch is the exact prayer of their petition, for the truth of which we appeal to the printed minutes of the hou&s;e, and likewi&s;e to the petition it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;ubject matters which your memoriali&s;ts have to lay before your honorable hou&s;e; they are concern|ed there &s;hould be any occa&s;ion to do it, and &s;till more con|cerned there &s;hould be &s;o much. The watching over the conduct of the repre&s;entatives is the proper duty of the ci|tizens of a free country, and in pre&s;enting this memorial we di&s;charge the duty incumbent on us.</P>
<P>We therefore pray your honorable hou&s;e, that the&s;e mat|ters may be taken into your mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration, and that either the repealing law may be repealed, or a bill be brought in, to &s;u&s;pend the operation of it, until your hon. hou&s;e can obtain full information on the &s;ubject.</P>
<CLOSER>And your memoriali&s;ts, &amp;c. Ordered to lie on the table.

<P>The Committee to whom were referred the memorials of the citizens of Philadelphia and other parts, &s;etting forth the irregular and partial conduct of the late hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, in repealing the Charter of the bank of North-America, and praying for a re&s;toration thereof, or a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the repealing act,&mdash;report,</P>

<P>That conceiving it more their duty to &s;tate facts than opi|nions, your committee, in order to obtain information as to the reality of the complaints alleged again&s;t the bank in certain petitions pre&s;ented to the late hou&s;e, applied to Mr. Whitehill and Mr. Smilie, members of a committee appoint|ed by that hou&s;e to <HI>enquire</HI> therein, and on who&s;e report a bill was brought in to repeal the &s;aid charter; and reque&s;ted to know what were the enquiries they had made in con&s;e|quence: but tho&s;e gentlemen in an&s;wer to a que&s;tion put to them, &s;aid, they had not called at the bank to make them|&s;elves acquainted with the nature of the tran&s;actions there: and your committee inferred generally from their conver&s;a|tion, that neither they, the &s;aid Mr. Whitehill and Mr. Smi|lie, nor any of their colleagues, had made any &s;pecial or oc|ca&s;ional enquiry whatever concerning the bank.</P>
<P>The memorials mentioning the names of eight per&s;ons who had &s;tood forth as &s;upporters of the petitions again&s;t the bank, four of them, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Me&s;&s;ieurs James Pear&s;on, Robert Smith, William Graham, and Frederick Heimberger, at|tending your committee in pur&s;uance of notifications &s;ent to
<PB N="9" REF="019884_0012_0FAD40F07000F0C0">
them, they the &s;aid four per&s;ons were que&s;tioned as to facts relating to the bank con&s;i&s;tent with their own knowledge: but they declined &s;atisfying your committee further than that they had not been at the bank to gain information.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident and &s;ome of the directors of the bank al&s;o attending at the reque&s;t of your committee, they affirmed that none of the members of the committee of the late hou&s;e, or any of all the petitioners, had ever a&s;ked information at the bank concerning the conduct of that in&s;titution, or the nature of its tran&s;actions, though they the &s;aid pre&s;ident and directors had at all times been ready to give &s;uch informati|on, and had invited free enquiry.</P>
<P>It will follow from this relation, that the report made to the late hou&s;e, was grounded in general notions preconceived, or on the current popular opinions and &s;peculations, with|out much con&s;ideration being be&s;towed on the &s;pecial &s;ub|ject; and the &s;ame may at lea&s;t be &s;aid of the petitions pre|&s;ented again&s;t the bank.</P>
<P>It will follow al&s;o that the hou&s;e did not derive from either members of that committee, or the &s;aid petitioners, tho&s;e clear lights which would have been nece&s;&s;ary to their deliberations on &s;o difficult and intere&s;ting a &s;ubject, and which from the in&s;tructions to their committee, they &s;eem to have de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Your committee on examining further into the conduct of the late hou&s;e, in this tran&s;action, could not but di&s;co|ver, in &s;ome in&s;tances, a &s;pirit little &s;uited to the tran&s;ient and accountable repre&s;entatives of a free people. In an early &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and when only it could have had its u&s;e, the bank was denied a hearing: and when at a later &s;tage, it was yielded to the repeated in&s;tances of its pre|&s;ident and directors, the permi&s;&s;ion was qualified with this remark, <Q>that it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a matter of <HI>favour</HI> and not of right.</Q> But the favour became nugatory through the application of a rule of order, which, obliging the council for the bank to &s;peak before the council for the petitioners, left him to combat in the dark again&s;t po&s;&s;ible charges and conjectural imputations. True it is, he was &s;uf|fered to make a reply to the adver&s;e coun&s;el, but within a time &s;o limited by the hou&s;e, as could &s;carcely be &s;ufficient for preparation in any petty cau&s;e in the ordinary courts.</P>
<P>Thus confining them&s;elves to facts and to reflections na|turally ari&s;ing from them, your committee conceive the con|duct of the late hou&s;e, in the in&s;tance of the bank, to be of
<PB N="10" REF="019884_0013_0FAD40F0D2C413C0">
mo&s;t dangerous example. In their precipitancy, they broke through the procra&s;tinating forms of proceeding, which were fixed as fences again&s;t the &s;udden violences of power. And in their partiality they appear to have manife&s;ted a pre|determination to condemn.</P>
<P>Your committee beg leave to remark on &s;ome circum|&s;tances attending the memorials pre&s;ented to this hou&s;e, which ought to have con&s;iderable weight in their pre&s;ent de|liberations. The &s;ub&s;cribers to the&s;e memorials are &s;o nu|merous as to be&s;peak the general &s;en&s;e of the community. In them are included the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters among&s;t us; men who, from their intercour&s;e and condition in life, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t experienced in the effects, good or bad, produced by the operations of the bank, and from ge|neral knowledge mo&s;t intelligent in the nature of &s;uch in|&s;titutions.</P>
<P>As the proceedings of the late hou&s;e in the ca&s;e of the bank, thus appear with all the marks of precipitancy, pre|judice and partiality, the annulling act has its foundation deeply laid in inju&s;tice, and remains a reproach both to the government and to the people. But your committee tru&s;ting in the wi&s;dom and probity of the pre&s;ent hou&s;e, to re&s;tore to the &s;tate its lo&s;t honour, &s;ubmit the following re&s;olution:</P>
<P>That a &s;pecial committee be appointed to prepare and bring in a bill to repeal an act, entitled, <Q>An act to repeal an act of a&s;&s;embly, entitled, An act to incorporate the &s;ub|&s;cribers to the bank of North America, al&s;o one other act, entitled, An act for preventing and puni&s;hing the counterfeiting of the common &s;eal, bank bills and bank notes of the pre&s;ident, directors, and company of the bank of North America, and for other purpo&s;es therein mentioned.</Q></P>

<P>AGREEABLY to the order of the day, took up for a &s;econd reading, the report of the committee to whom were referred the memorials praying a repeal or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the law for annulling the charter of the bank.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris having enquired the number of &s;igners to the petitions pre&s;ented to the late hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly relative to the bank, and to the memorials in favour of the bank, pre&s;ented to the pre&s;ent hou&s;e, they appeared as follow:</P>
<P>Petitions again&s;t the bank pre&s;ented to the late hou&s;e, &s;igned by 1199 per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Petitions in favour of the bank, pre&s;ented to the late hou&s;e &s;igned by 608 per&s;ons, of whom 516 were of the city of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Memorials in favour of the bank pre&s;ented to the pre&s;ent hou&s;e, &s;igned by 2947 per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The report being read,</P>
<P>Mr. Robin&s;on addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;peaker as follows: In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, two principal con&s;idera|tions ari&s;e: fir&s;t, by what authority a legi&s;lature can di&s;&s;olve a charter &s;olemnly granted to any in&s;titution: and &s;econdly, the utility or the bad con&s;equences of the particular in&s;titu|tion. I &s;hall not go into both. As a member of the com|mittee who have made the report before the hou&s;e, I &s;hall explain the ground of their proceeding, and &s;hall con&s;ider but one of tho&s;e points; the power to di&s;&s;olve a charter. The committee formed their conclu&s;ions from a conviction that the legi&s;lature has not that power. To decide this, two que&s;tions ari&s;e. In what capacity the legi&s;lature acts in granting charters of incorporation? And in what capacity in taking them away? In granting charters the legi&s;lature acts in a mini&s;terial capacity. In this propo&s;ition I am &s;up|ported by the con&s;titution. The ninth &s;ection of the frame of government &s;tates&mdash;that the a&s;&s;embly <Q>&s;hall &s;it on their own adjournments; prepare bills and enact them into laws; judge of the elections and qualifications of their own mem|bers: they may expel a member, but not a &s;econd time for the &s;ame cau&s;e; they may admini&s;ter oaths or affirma|tions on the examinations of witne&s;&s;es; redre&s;s grievances; impeach &s;tate criminals; grant charters of incorporation; con&s;titute towns, boroughs, and counties.</Q> All the&s;e, dif|fering
<PB N="12" REF="019884_0015_0FAD40F24E9E10C0">
in them&s;elves, are acts of the legi&s;lature. Some are for preparing general regulations, which extend to all the &s;tate; the&s;e are laws. They judge of the qualifications of their own members. Their &s;entence is not a law.&mdash;Their granting charters is an act of agency&mdash;in which they have a power to act for the community, who&s;e agents they are ap|pointed. This is totally di&s;tinct from the power of making laws, and it is a novel doctrine in Penn&s;ylvania that they can abrogate tho&s;e charters &s;o &s;olemnly granted. There is this grand di&s;tinction between laws and charters of incorpora|tion granted by the legi&s;lature.&mdash;The fir&s;t are general rules, which extend to the whole community&mdash;the &s;econd be&s;tow particular privileges upon a certain number of people. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell long upon this matter, as I propo&s;e merely to trace the ground of the proceedings of the com|mittee. The &s;econd que&s;tion which offers it&s;elf to us, is, in what capacity the legi&s;lature acts in taking away a charter? In this they act judicially. They hear the cau&s;e, and deter|mine on its merits. Now this exceeds their powers. They are not authori&s;ed by the con&s;titution to act in a judicial ca|pacity, but &s;o far as regards the qualifications of their own members&mdash;and in &s;ome few other matters, &s;o as to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from in&s;ult&mdash;&s;uch as in ca&s;e of di&s;turbances in the hou&s;e; for they could not &s;ecure them&s;elves from in&s;ult, if they could not take cognizance of the matter immediately. The&s;e are their only judicial powers. They are not competent to deci&s;ions in ca&s;es of property. Charters are a &s;pecies of pro|perty. When they are obtained, they are of value. Their forfeiture belongs &s;olely to the courts of ju&s;tice. The con|&s;titution &s;ays, <Q>that in controver&s;ies re&s;pecting property, the party &s;hall have a trial by jury.</Q> But the late hou&s;e &s;tepped between the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank, and their rights, and deprived them of the legal mode of trial. In this an e&s;&s;ential injury has been done them. The hou&s;e pre&s;umed upon its own power, and that it mu&s;t be obeyed&mdash;and upon the weakne&s;s of the other party. Let no man &s;ay, that tyranny cannot exi&s;t in a large a&s;&s;embly. It may become a many-headed hydra, as fond of power as in|dividuals. It is not the nature of mankind to give up what power they po&s;&s;e&s;s. They are fond of keeping, and even &s;ometimes of exceeding it. With even the be&s;t intentions, a legi&s;lature may go beyond the proper bounds, and be de|ceived into an opinion of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing powers they never were ve&s;ted with. In a free government like ours, it is particu|larly
<PB N="13" REF="019884_0016_0FAD40F34F19D840">
incumbent on us to prevent the attempts of an exorbi|tant power. The con&s;titution has &s;et bounds to the power of the legi&s;lature, and &s;aid, <Q>thus far &s;halt thou go, and no farther.</Q> Unle&s;s they break the original and fundamen|tal principles of the con&s;titution, they cannot pretend to a power of taking away charters. Perhaps it will be &s;aid, with Black&s;tone, that charters of incorporation may be for|feited by an act of parliament or of a&s;&s;embly. He holds the power of an act of parliament to be unbounded. But though this might be his opinion, it does not follow that it is ju&s;t: far otherwi&s;e. The more ea&s;y it is to make it obeyed, the more caution is nece&s;&s;ary to avoid inju&s;tice. Mo&s;t common law writers before Black&s;tone appear of a different opinion, by their &s;ilence re&s;pecting this method. And even he ap|pears to imply, it was power not right that did it. The only modes, therefore, by which charters can be vacated, are: 1&s;t. by death of the members of the corporation&mdash;2dly, by re&s;ignation of right&mdash;and 3dly, by forfeiture in the courts of ju&s;tice. As to the fir&s;t, nothing is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid. The &s;econd is voluntary, and a &s;pecies of legal &s;uicide. And the third is the only legal mode in which charters can be taken away in this country. The principles of our con|&s;titution are materially different from tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.&mdash;Here they are clearly defined. In Great Britain, an act of parliament has all the force of the con&s;ti|tution. In this country, the different &s;pecies of power are di&s;tributed to different bodies. If the original principles be broken, by one branch of government pa&s;&s;ing beyond the bounds which &s;eparate it from the other, liberty cannot long exi&s;t.</P>
<P>What is the manner of enquiry on trials, in the courts of ju&s;tice? The evidences are brought, and the parties are pre|&s;ent to examine them. Has this been the ca&s;e with the bank? Had the parties intere&s;ted in that in&s;titution, an op|portunity to examine the evidence again&s;t them? No. Charges were brought, but no evidence to &s;upport them. The charges might be true, or might not. But as the ne|ce&s;&s;ary forms were not ob&s;erved, it follows that there was a &s;entence given without any proof being made. The ninth &s;ection of the bill of rights declares, that a man charged with any crime, &s;hall be heard by him&s;elf and coun&s;el. Yet when the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank reque&s;ted to be heard by coun&s;el, in an early &s;tage of the bill, they were re|fu&s;ed: and when at length it was granted, it was declared a
<PB N="14" REF="019884_0017_0FAD40F3CE7EBD38">
matter of favour&mdash;not of right. True, if the hou&s;e, when it acts in a legi&s;lative capacity, hears coun&s;el, it may be &s;aid to be a matter of favour. But when it a&s;&s;umed the power of acting in a judicial capacity, it was a matter of indi&s;pen|ble right that the parties &s;hould be heard. The act of a&s;&s;em|bly relative to the bank, carries with it all the con&s;equences of an act of attainder&mdash;and awards a &s;entence, without hear|ing whether the charter was forfeited or not. From all the&s;e con&s;iderations, it fully appears that the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;em|bly had not &s;uch judicial powers as would be competent to decide on the ca&s;e of the bank: and even if they had, their proceedings were not conducted with the regularity or order requi&s;ite. The&s;e were the inducements on which the com|mittee framed their report&mdash;and the&s;e inducements will, I hope, be &s;ufficient to make the hou&s;e agree to it.</P>
<P>Mr. Lollar &s;aid, when the gentleman ro&s;e, he expected he meant, as one of the committee, to explain to the hou&s;e their rea&s;ons for making &s;uch a report. But he had not done it to his &s;atisfaction, and therefore he &s;hould make a few ob&s;ervations: one in particular on the report. Had the committee confined them&s;elves to the memorials, without ca&s;ting any reflections on the late a&s;&s;embly, they would have acted much better than they had done. But their report as it &s;tood, was a declaration of war again&s;t the late hou&s;e, and daring to the combat all &s;uch of its members as were in the pre&s;ent. If he had gone about to ca&s;t reflections, it &s;hould have been on the a&s;&s;embly that granted the charter, not on the a&s;&s;embly that took it away. It was not founded in ju&s;|tice. But the hou&s;e which granted it, entertained no idea of its being for a perpetuity, or of its being out of the power of the a&s;&s;embly to alter or new model it, as they might &s;ee fit. In &s;upport of this, mr. Lollar quoted the minutes of that hou&s;e, where it appeared that a clau&s;e had been intro|duced as a rider to the bill, for the purpo&s;e of empowering the a&s;&s;embly that &s;hould &s;it in 1789, to alter or amend the charter, as might be nece&s;&s;ary. This was rejected by 27 to 24, and the expre&s;s rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for the rejection, was, that the charter of the bank mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be always within the power of the hou&s;e. Mr. Lollar then &s;aid, that a law whereby the corporation had an unlimited &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was unju&s;t&mdash;and the annulling it highly proper. Thus matters were brought on the broad bottom of equality. The Charter was moreover unju&s;t, as the &s;tate had got no equivalent for the advantages it had be&s;towed: and civilians held that in all
<PB N="15" REF="019884_0018_0FAD40F4EDDC5370">
contracts, unle&s;s there was an equivalent received for what was given, the bargain or agreement was void in it&s;elf, and incomplete. The only con&s;ideration received from the bank, was, that it facilitated commerce. This in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the affairs of the &s;tate, was again&s;t it: as it was an engine of trade that enabled the merchants to import more goods than were nece&s;&s;ary, or than there was money to pay for. This was clearly di&s;advantageous. The learn|ed coun&s;el who had pleaded the cau&s;e of the bank, before the late a&s;&s;embly, had candidly and ingenuou&s;ly admitted, that when the balance of trade was again&s;t a country, a bank was injurious. Mr. Lollar then quoted the petitions pre&s;ented to the late hou&s;e again&s;t the bank, in the&s;e words: <Q>the directors of the bank are enabled to give &s;uch prefer|ences in trade, by advances of money to their particular favourites, when mo&s;t needed, as to de&s;troy that equality which ought to take place in a commercial country.</Q> He &s;aid the&s;e words were &s;o plain, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any more on that part of the ill con&s;equences re&s;ulting from the bank. He did not mean to &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of the pre&s;ent directors&mdash;any others in their &s;ituation, he believed, would do as they did. He begged the attention of the hou&s;e to another matter: under the old government, when there were people in the management of affairs as wi&s;e or perhaps wi&s;er than tho&s;e &s;ince, no idea had been ever entertained of a bank. Now if it would be a means of keeping the ca&s;h in the country, as had been &s;tated, it was &s;trange it had e&s;cap|ed their ob&s;ervation. But the be&s;t way of promoting the good of this country, that had ever yet been found out, was by paper money, emitted through the medium of a loan of|fice. Of this governor Pownal had &s;poken in the following terms: <Q>I will venture to &s;ay, that there never was a wi&s;er or a better mea&s;ure, never one better calculated to &s;erve the u&s;es of an increa&s;ing country; that there never was a mea&s;ure more &s;teadily pur&s;ued, or more faithfully execut|ed, for forty years together, than the Loan-office in Penn|&s;ylvania, formed and admini&s;tered by the a&s;&s;embly of that province.</Q> After all expedients &s;hould be tried, that would be found the only effectual one. He &s;aid, that by means of a bank the European merchants were enabled to procure and carry off money for their goods: and to fix the payment thereof upon the purcha&s;ers in that ha&s;ty manner which the rules of the bank required, the baneful effects of which had been &s;een and felt in and about the city.&mdash;Whereas if it were
<PB N="16" REF="019884_0019_0FAD40F56079E378">
not in exi&s;tence, they would be obliged to take produce in exchange for them. He hoped the report would be reject|ed. As a free citizen, he felt him&s;elf intere&s;ted in the mat|ter. He &s;hould, in his opinion, betray the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and act again&s;t the dictates of his con&s;cience, if he vot|ed for it.</P>
<P>Mr. Clymer &s;aid, if the gentleman had con&s;idered the matter properly, he would not have thought an explanati|on requi&s;ite of the rea&s;ons of the committee, further than was given in the report. He would find that there was a clo&s;e connection between the beginning and end of it. In the fir&s;t part, it was &s;tated, that the memorials had &s;et forth the mode of proceeding adopted by the late hou&s;e; it was further &s;tated, that the committee having made the nece&s;|&s;ary enquiries, had found that the mode of proceeding &s;o &s;et forth, was confirmed by the minutes of the late hou&s;e. There was, therefore, no nece&s;&s;ity for the committee to go into a recapitulation of what was &s;o fully &s;tated in the me|morials, which were the ground of their proceedings. The report was &s;ufficiently long already.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitz&s;imons. I was not a member of the committee who made the report now before the hou&s;e, and e&s;teem my|&s;elf no further bound to advocate it, than as it coincides with my own &s;entiments. I am of opinion, that the com|mittee not only made a proper report, but paid a proper re|&s;pect to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by this hou&s;e. They made enquiries into the &s;tatement given in the memorials&mdash;and the deductions naturally ari&s;ing from the re&s;ult of tho&s;e en|quiries, they laid before the hou&s;e. As this que&s;tion is of the utmo&s;t importance, not only to the intere&s;ts of the citi|zens of Penn&s;ylvania, but to the union in general, I could have wi&s;hed it confined to a narrow ground, that it might be perfectly under&s;tood.&mdash;The memorials complain that the former hou&s;e did not proceed with the deliberation nece&s;&s;a|ry, not only in a ca&s;e of &s;uch con&s;equence as the pre&s;ent mu&s;t be acknowledged, but in any ca&s;e whatever. Whether the bank is beneficial or injurious, is not the que&s;tion: but whether the former hou&s;e had &s;ufficient evidence to warrant their proceedings. What may be the opinion of other gen|tlemen, I do not know. Mine is, that they had not. This is the ground which I think we ought to confine our debates to. But it has already been deviated from. To prove that the former hou&s;e had not the nece&s;&s;ary evidence, we have only to recur to their minutes. By tho&s;e, it appears that the attack on the bank originated by a petition from Che&s;ter
<PB N="17" REF="019884_0020_0FAD40F680B0F4C8">
county. This petition &s;tated what the petitioners thought injurious in the in&s;titution of the bank. Afterwards, other petitions of the &s;ame tendency were pre&s;ented. The hou&s;e, as in duty bound, referred tho&s;e petitions to a committee, with directions to enquire into the allegations they con|tained, in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>Re&s;olved, That the &s;aid petitions be referred to a com|mittee, and that the committee be in&s;tructed to enquire whether the bank e&s;tabli&s;hed at Philadelphia, be compati|ble with the public &s;afety, and that equality which ought ever to prevail between the individuals of a republic, and to report thereon.</Q></P>
<P>So far the hou&s;e did their duty. What was the further progre&s;s of this bu&s;ine&s;s? The committee &s;o appointed made report. But did they in that report &s;tate that they had made the enquiry they were directed to make? Did they &s;ub|mit the circum&s;tances that occurred in their enquiry, to the hou&s;e? No, they did not. They therefore made them&s;elves re&s;pon&s;ible for the con&s;equences: and I wi&s;h their re&s;pon&s;i|bility could be &s;eparated from that of the hou&s;e. Their re|port contained no information for the hou&s;e to deliberate upon: it contained merely opinions&mdash;and, if we may judge from circum&s;tances, even tho&s;e opinions were taken up on tru&s;t; for the report is drawn up in the hand-writing of a per&s;on not of that committee: and, &s;o far as we can decide from &s;imilarity of hand-writing, by the &s;ame per&s;on who framed the petition from Che&s;ter county. This is the ground of the proceeding of the pre&s;ent hou&s;e. If, there|fore, it appears that the former hou&s;e have tried and con|demned the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank unheard, it is incumbent on the pre&s;ent hou&s;e to abrogate their proceed|ings, and do ju&s;tice to the injured. And that they did &s;o, is now in proof before us.</P>
<P>As to the ju&s;tice of the act, if it be introduced in the cour&s;e of the debate, I &s;hall endeavour to give my opinion on it. It is a &s;erious thing for a legi&s;lature to deprive a body of people of their rights in any in&s;tance; but very &s;erious, indeed, to deprive them unheard and untried. For the circum&s;tances of this procedure we need only recur to the memorials&mdash;From them it will appear that the former hou&s;e conducted it&s;elf with an informality, not only incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of this government, but with the princi|ples of any government that pretends to freedom.</P>
<P>This is not the fir&s;t charter which has been taken away in this &s;tate. The charter of the college was taken away at
<PB N="18" REF="019884_0021_0FAD40F6CA204130">
a former period. But in that ca&s;e, it was pretended that the charter had been forfeited. Even this was not thought nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to the bank. If &s;uch be the progre&s;s of inju&s;tice, there is no telling where it will end. A gentle|man has &s;aid the &s;tatement of the committee is a declaration of war again&s;t members of the late hou&s;e who have &s;eats in the pre&s;ent. But if &s;peaking&punc; the truth be a declaration of war, I hope we &s;hall ever have men in this hou&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;pirit &s;ufficient to declare war in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. Had the committee been guilty of mi&s;-&s;tating the facts, or draw|ing wrong inferences from them, that would have been &s;uf|ficient ground to criminate them: but this is not a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to go into an enquiry whether or no the charter was granted improperly. That is not pretend|ed in the repealing act. If the former hou&s;e had thought that good ground, they would have taken it; as they did not, their advocates now cannot avail them&s;elves of it.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that the charter is an e&s;tate entailed: this is not the fact. The property is con&s;tantly transferring: and I believe there has been no day &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank, but the gentlemen who have hazarded this a&s;&s;er|tion, might have purcha&s;ed &s;hares in the &s;tock.</P>
<P>A gentleman who has &s;poken again&s;t the report, has told us, that the coun&s;el who pleaded in favour of the bank be|fore the late hou&s;e, conceded that a bank was unfavourable to a nation when the balance of trade was again&s;t her. If the coun&s;el made that conce&s;&s;ion, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, he was not warranted in &s;o doing by his clients: and it will only &s;erve to prove, that a gentleman may be not only emi|nent in his profe&s;&s;ion, but have great general knowledge, without being able to decide on all que&s;tions: for I, who have no preten&s;ions to that gentleman's knowledge or abili|ty, not only deny the fact, but undertake to prove that it is not well founded. The report of the committee of the late hou&s;e carries a contradiction to this conce&s;&s;ion on the very face of it. It &s;ays the bank has a tendency to accumulate the wealth of the country in the hands of the &s;tock-holders. I do not mean in this &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s to detain the hou&s;e, by going into all the arguments that have been of|fered for and again&s;t the bank. As I &s;et out upon a nar|row ground, I &s;hall &s;o conclude.</P>
<P>My view in ri&s;ing was to endeavour to confine the argu|ments to the report of the committee: but as I pre&s;ume it will not be adhered to, I re&s;erve to my&s;elf the right of an|&s;wering
<PB N="19" REF="019884_0022_0FAD40F8F09B38D8">
what may be offered in debate by the gentleman op|po&s;ed to the re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie. I find my&s;elf on this occa&s;ion called upon, not only to defend my country, but to account for my own conduct. And here I beg it may be con&s;idered, that the gentlemen on the other &s;ide of this que&s;tion, feel intere&s;ted in it per&s;onally. Tho&s;e gentlemen are to plead for them&s;elves, and to defend their own cau&s;e: whereas we on this &s;ide have no private intere&s;t to &s;erve on the occa&s;ion. In judging of our conduct, I hope re&s;pect will be had to that con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t make &s;ome remarks on the report of the com|mittee, which is now the &s;ubject of our di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. It is in this report &s;tated, that I told the committee, (when a&s;ked a que&s;tion relative to the information procured by the com|mittee of the late hou&s;e) that <Q>I had not been at the bank to procure information.</Q> This I totally deny. I call up|on the gentlemen of the committee for proofs of their a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Mr. Clymer. I ri&s;e to affirm the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion. Mr. Whitehill, when called upon, an&s;wered with much candour. Mr. Smilie was at fir&s;t very coy and re&s;tiff. He declared he e&s;teemed him&s;elf not bound to an&s;wer any of our que&s;tions, and &s;hould be prepared to give &s;atisfaction to the hou&s;e. But having a&s;ked him was he at the bank for in|formation? he, upon my honour, an&s;wered, "No." Mr. Fitz&s;imons was pre&s;ent. I call upon that gentleman to de|clare what he heard.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitz&s;imons. I am &s;orry the time of the hou&s;e &s;hould be taken up on &s;o important an occa&s;ion, by &s;o trifling a bu&s;ine&s;s. But &s;ince I find my&s;elf called upon, I mu&s;t inform the hou&s;e, that I was in the committee room on the day the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank were reque&s;ted to at|tend by the committee. And mr. Smilie being al&s;o there, was a&s;ked &s;everal que&s;tions. He &s;aid he could ea&s;ily an&s;wer, but he did not e&s;teem him&s;elf bound: he &s;hould be prepared to an&s;wer at a proper time. However, being at length a&s;ked, had he been at the bank for information, he declared, No.</P>
<P>Here mr. Smilie called upon me&s;&s;rs. Rittenhou&s;e and Ed|gar, two members of the committee, who had been pre&s;ent at the time alluded to, to declare what had pa&s;&s;ed. They both &s;aid, that he [mr. Smilie] would not an&s;wer any que&s;tions.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="019884_0023_0FAD40FA1A4B3B50">
Mr. Clymer called upon mr. Lilly, another member of the committee, who&s;e declaration was &s;imilar to that of mr. Fitz&s;imons.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie. This matter cannot be accounted for but on the ground of different parties. Mr. Rittenhou&s;e and mr. Edgar refu&s;ed to &s;ign the report.</P>
<P>Mr. Clymer. It was read to tho&s;e gentlemen: and it was their duty, as members of the committee, to point out wherein it was erroneous: but this they did not attempt to do.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie. Setting a&s;ide this point, I &s;hall now proceed to the con&s;ideration of the report. One paragraph of it is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>Your committee, in examining further into the con|duct of the late hou&s;e in this tran&s;action, could not but di&s;cover, in &s;ome in&s;tances, a &s;pirit little &s;uited to the tran&s;ient and accountable repre&s;entatives of a free people. In an early &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and when only it could have had its u&s;e, the bank was denied a hearing: and when, at a later &s;tage, it was yielded to the repeated in&s;tances of its pre&s;ident and directors, the permi&s;&s;ion was qualified with this remark, <HI>That it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a matter of favour, and not of right.</HI> But the favour became nugatory, through the application of a rule of order, which, obliging the coun&s;el for the bank to &s;peak before the coun&s;el for the petitioners, left him to combat in the dark, again&s;t po&s;&s;ible charges and conjectural imputations. True it is, he was &s;uffered to make a reply to the adver&s;e coun&s;el, but within a time &s;o limited by the hou&s;e, as could &s;carcely be &s;ufficient for preparation in any petty cau&s;e in the ordinary courts.</Q></P>
<P>This is one of the mo&s;t groundle&s;s complaints I ever heard, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the pre&s;ident and directors were not heard in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. It was certainly in the di&s;cretion of the hou&s;e whether to hear them on the report of the committee, or on the bill. And I believe it is the practice in Eng|land, never to hear petitions till after the &s;econd reading of bills; as, until then, it is not known what they may prove to be. This bill, of which we hear &s;o much complaint made, was read the &s;econd time in the winter &s;e&s;&s;ions, and then lay over till the fall, a period of nearly five months&mdash;was not that a &s;ufficient time for the public to con&s;ider on it? Was not coun&s;el then heard again&s;t it? Why then is it a&s;&s;erted that it had not a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion? Some remarks have been made on the hearing having been granted not as a matter
<PB N="21" REF="019884_0024_0FAD40FA92773BE0">
of right: but it will not be &s;aid that the con&s;titution gives any &s;uch right to be heard before the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The report goes on to &s;ay: <Q>Your committee beg leave to remark on &s;ome circum&s;tances attending the memorials pre&s;ented to this hou&s;e, which ought to have con&s;idera|ble weight in their pre&s;ent deliberations. The &s;ub&s;cribers to the&s;e memorials are &s;o numerous as to be&s;peak the ge|neral &s;en&s;e of the community. In them are included the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters among&s;t us; men, who, from their intercour&s;es and condition in life, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t experienced in the effects, good or bad, produced by the operations of the bank, and from general knowledge, mo&s;t intelligent in the nature of &s;uch in&s;titutions.</Q></P>
<P>What is this great number of &s;ub&s;cribers? Two thou&s;and nine hundred and forty-&s;even. Can this number be &s;aid to &s;peak the general &s;en&s;e of the community? The in&s;titution of the bank is advantageous to many of the &s;ub&s;cribers&mdash;and their power and influence, and I believe the influence and terrors of the bank, have been exerted to procure &s;ub&s;cribers to tho&s;e memorials. They were fabricated in this city, pre|pared, printed, and &s;ent down to the country. It is well known how ea&s;y a matter it is to procure &s;igners in the country. We had, a few days &s;ince, petitions from Lan|ca&s;ter, Bucks, and Cumberland counties, again&s;t the exten|&s;ion of the market-hou&s;e, procured by the influence of the per&s;ons intere&s;ted again&s;t the mea&s;ure in this city: this &s;uf|ficiently accounts for the number of memoriali&s;ts. But ad|mitting that no &s;uch means were u&s;ed, it cannot be &s;aid that they &s;peak the general &s;en&s;e of the community. It is an a&s;|&s;ertion not founded in fact. The committee, indeed, &s;aw the numbers were not &s;ufficient, and they tried to make up the deficiency another way. They inform us, that <Q>in them are included the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters among&s;t us.</Q> This is holding out an ari&s;tocratical idea. <Q>An hone&s;t man's the noble&s;t work of God.</Q> A democratical government like ours, admits of no &s;uperiority. A virtu|ous man, be his &s;ituation what it may, is re&s;pectable. If we enquire what con&s;titutes the re&s;pectability meant in the report, we &s;hall very probably find it riches. They have more money than their neighbours, and are therefore more re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>The report continues: <Q>As the proceedings of the late hou&s;e, in the ca&s;e of the bank, thus appear with all the marks of precipitancy, prejudice and partiality, the an|nulling
<PB N="22" REF="019884_0025_0FAD40FB50F36E88">
act has its foundation deeply laid in inju&s;tice, and remains a reproach both to the government and to the people.</Q></P>
<P>Let us examine whether this act has its foundation laid in inju&s;tice. For this purpo&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider a lit|tle the &s;ubject of charters. I would ob&s;erve, by the bye, that my worthy friend over the way, (Mr. Robin&s;on) has been puzzling him&s;elf with Black&s;tone, which mu&s;t ever be the ca&s;e with any per&s;on who takes the negative &s;ide of the que&s;tion. And here I will make this conce&s;&s;ion, that there are charters &s;o &s;acred, that they cannot be revoked. But there is a material di&s;tinction between charters&mdash;and the opinions of many have been very wrong on that head. When once an error is taken up, men go on a long time in delu&s;ion. There are many things which we now con&s;ider as ab&s;urd, which were formerly venerated, for want of being properly con&s;idered.&mdash;The doctrine of hereditary right, which is now held odious, was once deemed &s;acred. There is a &s;trong rea&s;on, why per&s;ons from Europe are &s;o highly pre|judiced in favour of charters. In the 12th and 13th cen|turies, Europe was in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage&mdash;the peo|ple were in &s;ome mea&s;ure rooted to the &s;oil, and &s;old with it. While affairs were in that &s;ituation, the kings and powerful barons granted charters of incorporation, to towns and ci|ties, thereby exempting them from the common va&s;&s;alage of the &s;tate, and be&s;towing on them particular immunities; thus giving them political exi&s;tence. The&s;e charters were &s;acred, becau&s;e they &s;ecured to the per&s;ons on whom they were be|&s;towed, their natural rights and privileges. But there are, &s;ir, charters of a very different nature. And here it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to fix the point of di&s;tinction. Charters are rendered &s;acred, not becau&s;e they are given by the a&s;&s;embly, or by the parliament&mdash;but by the objects for which they are given. If a charter is given in a favour of a monopoly, whereby the natural and legal rights of mankind are invaded, to benefit certain individuals, it would be a dangerous doctrine to hold that it could not be annulled. All the natural rights of the people, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the welfare of man|kind, are &s;ecured by the con&s;titution. All charters grant|ing exclu&s;ive rights, are a monopoly on the great charter of mankind. The happine&s;s of the people is the fir&s;t law.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the charges again&s;t the bank have not been properly proved. But tho&s;e who recur to the re|port of the committee of the late hou&s;e, will &s;ee that proofs were not wanting. A very &s;light reading of the report may
<PB N="23" REF="019884_0026_0FAD40FC0F9C5E50">
convince gentlemen that the committee were not appointed to &s;ee whether the pre&s;ident and directors had done their duty. The matter was taken up on a higher ground. The com|mittee were directed to enquire whether or no the bank was compatible with the &s;afety and welfare of the &s;tate. This, the hou&s;e, as guardians of the rights and liberties of the people, had a right to examine into. Let us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment the committee had not made the enquiry&mdash;was not the hou&s;e at liberty to con&s;ider their report, and as they a|greed in opinion with it, to pa&s;s the act recommended in that report? If the hou&s;e had not that right, dreadful would be our &s;ituation indeed. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of their duty, and &s;o corrupt, as to give a charter of monopoly to five men, of all our Ea&s;t India trade&mdash;to five others, of our trade to Europe&mdash;and to five more, of our trade to the We&s;t Indies&mdash;I grant that it is not likely that this will ever happen&mdash;but that is nothing to the point.&mdash;If one hou&s;e, I &s;ay, is guilty of this mi&s;chief, and that the next that meets, beholding this mon&s;ter in the face of the con&s;titution, has not power to give redre&s;s, to what purpo&s;e are annual elections? Corrupt chartered boroughs in Great Britain have eaten up the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution. If the hou&s;e cannot afford a remedy, the people mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the means God and nature have given them for redre&s;s. No good man can wi&s;h this to happen. I hope it never will. The right of the hou&s;e to repeal charters was debated in the council of cen&s;ors&mdash;and a member of that body, now in this hou&s;e, and in favour of the bank, conceded the point of right in the legi&s;lature to revoke them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mention a ca&s;e, which will &s;hew that we are not the only people afraid of banks. In Ireland, in the year 1721, a bank was about to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. It was held to be a &s;urpri&s;ing fine thing&mdash;But after the hou&s;e of commons had maturely con&s;idered of the matter, they came to the follow|ing re&s;olution: <Q>Re&s;olved, that if any member of this hou&s;e, or commoner of Ireland, &s;hall pre&s;ume to &s;olicit, or en|deavour to procure any grant, or to get the great &s;eal put to any charter, for erecting a bank in this kingdom, con|trary to the declared &s;en&s;e and re&s;olution of this hou&s;e, he &s;hall incur their highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, and be deemed to act in contempt of the authority of this hou&s;e, and an enemy to his country.</Q></P>
<P>[Here Mr. Smilie read an extract from the journals of the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of commons, containing their proceedings on the above bu&s;ine&s;s, from its fir&s;t introduction to its final rejecti|on. He then proceeded as follows:]</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="019884_0027_0FAD40FCCF5C3870">
If a bank was regarded &s;o dangerous in a country, where there was a counterbalance to its influence, how much more &s;o mu&s;t it be here, where there is no &s;uch counterbalance?</P>
<P>The charter of the bank was not taken away for what the pre&s;ident and directors had done&mdash;they, I believe, acted as innocently as any others would have done in the &s;ame &s;ituati|on.&mdash;But it was taken away from a conviction of its dange|rous tendency. We lately had a propo&s;al to mortgage the revenues of the &s;tate to the bank&mdash;thus to get the &s;tate into its tramels.</P>
<P>A word or two with re&s;pect to paper money. The paper money of the &s;tate cannot exi&s;t with the bank. And the que&s;tion is not&mdash;whether or no we &s;hall have paper money&mdash;but who &s;hall emit it&mdash;the bank or the &s;tate? If the bank emits it, it mu&s;t have the profits. State paper money has been found of the utmo&s;t utility, in former times and late|ly. Had it not been for the la&s;t emi&s;&s;ion of it, the &s;tate could not have paid the public creditors. There were no o|ther means; and a number of valuable citizens mu&s;t have been unpaid their ju&s;t demands. Con&s;idering the difficulties of government, no he&s;itation can remain in any man's mind, re&s;pecting the propriety of emitting paper. If the &s;tate is o|bliged to borrow, &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pay 6 per cent.&mdash;where|as, if &s;he emits on loan, &s;he gains 6 per cent, in her favour. All the&s;e advantages we mu&s;t give up, if we re&s;tore that in|&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to mention the endeavours u&s;ed to prevent the emi&s;&s;ion of paper money by the committee of merchants. The&s;e gentlemen mu&s;t not take it ami&s;s if we &s;tyle them bankers&mdash;as I believe all of them are &s;uch. This was at a time of the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, when the cries of the public creditors were heard by every ear.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid in the cour&s;e of this debate, that the learn|ed coun&s;el in favour of the bank, conceded, that when the balance of trade is again&s;t a nation, a bank is injurious to it. A gentleman from the city has undertaken to deny that this is the ca&s;e. But I believe that he will find it difficult to di&s;|prove it. His a&s;&s;ertion controverts the general &s;en&s;e of mankind.</P>
<P>The operations of the bank are prejudicial in a point of view in which I have not yet con&s;idered them. They are a di&s;couragement to agriculture, and to improvements in the city. From the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank, intere&s;t ro&s;e from &s;ix per cent. to the enormous degree at which we &s;ee it at
<PB N="25" REF="019884_0028_0FAD40FDD7CE2590">
pre&s;ent. U&s;ury has been coeval with the bank. It was not known here before.</P>
<P>A man finds it much more to his advantage to lodge his ca&s;h in the bank, than to purcha&s;e with it lots, lands, or hou&s;es. The per&s;on who has tho&s;e, finds it impo&s;&s;ible to procure money at legal intere&s;t to improve them, and is therefore inclined to &s;ell them&mdash;the &s;ame rea&s;on that inclines him to &s;ell, deters others from purcha&s;ing&mdash;thus the value of lands, hou&s;es, &amp;c. is depreciated.</P>
<P>The former hou&s;e, con&s;idering all the&s;e things&mdash;con&s;ider|ing that the bank &s;tood in the way of paper money&mdash;con&s;i|dering that a loan-office and it could not exi&s;t together&mdash;con&s;idering that it was a bar to the improvement of the country, and to agriculture, thought them&s;elves fully ju&s;ti|fied in taking away the charter. And it is equally our duty to leave matters in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. The bank has not &s;uffered. The &s;tock-holders have gained enough&mdash;In one year they cleared &s;ixteen and a half per cent. Why &s;hould we injure our country in favour of an in&s;titution, in|compatible with the public welfare? I therefore hope the hou&s;e will agree to let the bank re&s;t where it is, and &s;upport the paper money of the &s;tate, from which &s;o many advantages are derived.</P>
<P>On motion, ordered that the further con&s;ideration of the report be po&s;tponed.</P>
<P>Adjourned.</P>

<P>RESUMED the con&s;ideration of the report of the committee to whom were referred the memorials pray|ing a repeal or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the law annulling the charter of the bank.</P>
<P>Mr. Clymer. As I had the honour, mr. Speaker, to be a member of the committee who made the report now under the con&s;ideration of the hou&s;e, I think my&s;elf bound to de|fend it from &s;ome important charges made again&s;t it. A gentleman [mr. Smilie] has given us to under&s;tand, that the committee proceeded a wrong way, when they &s;tated that the committee of the late hou&s;e &s;hould have made enquiries, which they did not. He &s;eems to &s;ay, that the a&s;&s;embly, in the plenitude of their power, might pa&s;s the repealing act without any enquiries&mdash;but this is directly in op|po&s;ition to the principles laid down by the late a&s;&s;embly
<PB N="26" REF="019884_0029_0FAD40FE8D764A00">
them&s;elves. They expre&s;sly directed the committee to make enquiry, whether the bank was compatible with the welfare of the &s;tate. Have this inque&s;t and pre&s;entment been held? No. The act, therefore, in the very preamble of it, car|ries a fal&s;ehood. What then becomes of the apologi&s;t of the proceedings of the late hou&s;e? He a&s;cribes to them greater powers than they pretend to. They &s;aid an enquiry was nece&s;&s;ary. He &s;ays not. The committee having traced out that no enquiry had been made, and having found the proceedings of the late hou&s;e, as well as of their committee, exceptionable, had a right, as freemen, to pa&s;s their judg|ment on them. I hope we &s;hall always have men of &s;uffi|cient &s;pirit, to &s;peak their &s;entiments freely of the highe&s;t authority in the &s;tate. For my own part, I have ever &s;et my face again&s;t a tyrannical abu&s;e of power; and in a prote&s;t in 1779, again&s;t the proceedings in the college bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;poke my &s;entiments of the then hou&s;e, of which I was a member, as freely as I have done in the report before you, of the late hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall examine &s;ome of the principles whereon is founded the report of la&s;t year. Among the re&s;t, is this, that the balance of trade is again&s;t us, and that therefore the bank mu&s;t be injurious. This balance is the metaphy&s;ics of com|merce, which few under&s;tand, and which &s;erve no other purpo&s;e than to di&s;turb the imagination. In England, Gee and Child wrote much on that &s;ubject. They pretended to demon&s;trate that the nation would be ruined by certain branches of trade. But as the nation grew richer and richer by them, nothing but experience could prove the fallacy of their arguments. It is a point, which from being &s;o little under&s;tood, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e made any impre&s;&s;ion on the committee them&s;elves; though it had its u&s;e in the enumera|tion, as it &s;welled the evils attendant on the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>There are two other principles of more &s;olidity laid down in the report: one is, that the bank may have a pernicious influence&mdash;Banks are the nece&s;&s;ary appendages of a certain degree of commerce. Let us &s;ee what are the intere&s;ts of commerce, and we &s;hall then know how its influence, where it has any, will be pointed. It has, then, an evident inte|re&s;t in the general pro&s;perity&mdash;in the &s;ecurity of property&mdash;and in the toleration of every man to pur&s;ue his own benefit in his own way, provided it be not incompatible with the public good. The&s;e are the objects which commerce and its banks would endeavour to accompli&s;h, and they are cer|tainly
<PB N="27" REF="019884_0030_0FAD410158822B80">
not pernicious. The early immunities and privileges be&s;towed on traders in modern Europe, after the extinction of the Roman empire, were the fir&s;t &s;eeds of any national liberty which followed. But a gentleman has produced the example of an entire nation oppo&s;ed to the influence of banks&mdash;he has, however, greatly blundered at the application of this example. The Iri&s;h nation, in 1721, and many years after, was greatly dependent on England, both in its liber|ties and trade. In this &s;ituation, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a bank mu&s;t have been attempted either by the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, further to di&s;tre&s;s the trade of the country&mdash;and there fore oppo&s;ed by the Iri&s;h patriots;&mdash;or attempted by tho&s;e pa|triots, to relieve their trade from Engli&s;h oppre&s;&s;ion, and therefore oppo&s;ed by the mini&s;try. But the gentleman, when he told us this &s;tory, &s;hould have recollected the oath put to witne&s;&s;es in the courts of ju&s;tice&mdash;not only to tell the truth&mdash;but the whole truth. He &s;hould, therefore, have proceed|ed a little further, and informed us, that the Iri&s;h nation having, by a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggle about the year 1780, in which they were favoured by the American war, thrown off the yoke of Briti&s;h tyranny, and a&s;&s;umed a &s;ituation equal to that of England, they turned their fir&s;t thoughts to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a public bank, as congenial with their then &s;ituation. Whether or no they have e&s;tabli&s;hed it, I can|not &s;ay po&s;itively, having the &s;tory only from a new&s;paper writer, of the gentleman's own &s;ide. But this much is cer|tain, that while Ireland was in a &s;tate of &s;ubjection, &s;he re|jected the idea of a bank&mdash;but when in our &s;ituation, &s;he regarded it as advantageous. Thus this in&s;tance, on which the gentleman has dwelt with a great air of triumph, proves nothing in his favour.</P>
<P>Another principle laid down in the report of the commit|tee of the late hou&s;e, is the incompatibility of the bank and the paper money of government. On this occa&s;ion we have had an eulogium on paper money, from governor Pownal. But let it be con&s;idered that paper money is the offspring of credit and confidence, which this &s;tate was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of before the revolution. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, he &s;poke highly of its u&s;es: but Pownal would have been both a knave and a madman to contend for it, when both credit and confi|dence were wanting. An argument has been here made u&s;e of, that we have emitted paper money with &s;ucce&s;s. It is true we have made an experiment, and it has not failed. But let us &s;top here. I am confident that to attempt ano|ther
<PB N="28" REF="019884_0031_0FAD41026C299E48">
emi&s;&s;ion would de&s;troy that already in circulation: and I would remark that it has owed &s;ome of its credit to the fal&s;e calculations made upon the extent of our revenue. I hope it will maintain the degree of credit it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. There always have been, and always will be numbers of people in want of money: but if we go on making it, till every body cries hold, we &s;hall reduce it from being equal to gold or &s;il|ver, not to be equal to lead. Several &s;tates which have been wife enough to prohibit paper money among them, have by that means encrea&s;ed their &s;pecie in a great degree.</P>
<P>To conclude: Banks are in general encouraged in all the commercial nations of Europe. And the more republican a country is&mdash;or at lea&s;t the greater degree of liberty it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es&mdash;the greater is the &s;ucce&s;s of its banks. Why then &s;hall our puny politicians pretend to oppo&s;e their &s;pecula|tions to the experience of Europe for ages? A public bank affords many advantages. It on occa&s;ion gives aid to go|vernment&mdash;and &s;ecurity and convenience to individuals. In|deed a certain degree of commerce renders a bank &s;o ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, that if this public bank be de&s;troyed, pri|vate banks will ari&s;e out of its ruins, 'till the demands of trade are &s;atisfied. The&s;e will not be of &s;uch governmental utility, nor afford &s;uch private &s;ecurity. If the la&s;t hou&s;e had this in contemplation, where was their wi&s;dom?&mdash;if not, where was their fore&s;ight?</P>
<P>Mr. Woods &s;poke in favour of the report.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitz&s;imons &s;aid, he wi&s;hed the debate had been con|fined to the report of the committee: not that he was ap|prehen&s;ive a general di&s;cu&s;&s;ion would operate again&s;t the re|&s;olution recommended in the report: but he wi&s;hed to take the &s;tatement as made by the committee, and examine whe|ther it was founded or not. The gentlemen in oppo&s;ition to it, did not choo&s;e to fight the battle upon that ground.</P>
<P>Here the Speaker declared, that having con&s;idered the que&s;tion as of the greate&s;t importance, he had been willing to allow the utmo&s;t latitude to gentlemen in the debate.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie was &s;orry the &s;peaker's conduct was called in que&s;tion. There had been no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. It would have been extremely improper to confine the mem|bers to the report. The que&s;tion &s;hould be taken up on the broade&s;t ground.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitz&s;imons declared he had no idea of arraigning the conduct of the &s;peaker; nor did he mean to control any member in his manner of managing his arguments on the
<PB N="29" REF="019884_0032_0FAD41039A776400">
pre&s;ent que&s;tion. He had only expre&s;&s;ed his own wi&s;h that the debate had been confined within a narrower compa&s;s. He then proceeded thus:</P>
<P>I advocate the re&s;olution recommended in the report, and &s;hall continue &s;o to do, on this principle, that the late hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly had not tho&s;e lights, nor that information that could warrant their proceedings. This is the proper &s;ubject of debate: but the gentlemen on the other &s;ide of the que&s;|tion, know that it is not their &s;trong ground. They there|fore abandon it. Neither a corporation nor a citizen can be deprived of any rights without being heard: this is the ground of the re&s;olution now under con&s;ideration. But &s;ince the gentlemen have wandered away from this point, I &s;hall endeavour to follow them on the ground they have taken.</P>
<P>One gentleman &s;et out with reque&s;ting the hou&s;e to con&s;i|der that the members on this &s;ide of the que&s;tion are pleading their own cau&s;e: and that they are intere&s;ted in the in&s;titu|tion of the bank. I believe I am the only member in this hou&s;e, who have a &s;eat in the direction of the bank. But I &s;ubmit to the hou&s;e whether or no this ob&s;ervation is can|did. I hope our votes and our conduct in this hou&s;e will not be influenced by any partial intere&s;ts which we may have in the in&s;titution, but by what, in our opinion and judgment, will have a tendency to promote the general good. I have had the honour to be one of the directors of the bank from the fir&s;t in&s;titution of it&mdash;and I take upon me to &s;ay, that in no other &s;ituation whatever, could I have been &s;o u&s;eful to my fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the charge made again&s;t the late hou&s;e, of their not hearing the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank on the fir&s;t application, a gentleman has told us it was in their di&s;cretion whether to hear them or not. The di&s;cre|tion of the hou&s;e is not ea&s;ily defined. But I believe it will be admitted that it &s;hould be bounded by rea&s;on. And &s;ure|ly it is not con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on or ju&s;tice to condemn peo|ple unheard. I contend that the late a&s;&s;embly acted without either rea&s;on or ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this debate, many a&s;&s;ertions have been ha|zarded, without proofs being brought in &s;upport of them. Among the number, is that re&s;pecting the terrors and influ|ence of the bank having been exerted to procure &s;igners to the memorials pre&s;ented to this hou&s;e in favor of that in&s;ti|tution. If I were to affirm the contrary, the gentleman who made the a&s;&s;ertion, would find it extremely difficult to bring
<PB N="30" REF="019884_0033_0FAD41044BAE9DA8">
any confirmation of it. I think I have good authority for &s;aying that no &s;uch terror or influence was u&s;ed. The &s;ign|ers in general are per&s;ons above influence or terror&mdash;of in|dependent fortunes and &s;ituations.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Fayette county made a conce&s;&s;ion, which, I think, will operate much again&s;t him. He acknow|ledged that the charter of the bank was not repealed for a|ny injury received from that in&s;titution&mdash;but from an appre|hen&s;ion of what might ari&s;e from it. If this be a &s;ufficient ground to warrant the proceedings of the late hou&s;e, I do not know what we may in time proceed to. The gentleman has argued much again&s;t granting monopolies. But how did he learn that the charter of the bank was a monopoly? He has hereby &s;hewn his ignorance, or &s;omething wor&s;e.&mdash;The charter of that in&s;titution did not preclude any other per&s;ons from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of another bank. There was therefore no monopoly.</P>
<P>Sufficient notice has already been taken of the gentleman's extract from the journals of the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of commons. I &s;hall, however, ju&s;t remark, that there are in Ireland, many banks&mdash;&s;ome &s;imilar to that in this city&mdash;banks of di&s;count, and banks of depo&s;it. The little trade that country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, could not be carried on without banks.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the charges brought again&s;t the bank, is the pro|po&s;al made by a member of this hou&s;e to mortgage certain revenues of the &s;tate to that corporation. But as this pro|po&s;al was made without the knowledge of the pre&s;ident and directors, no charge can ju&s;tly lie again&s;t them on that ac|count. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not wi&s;h to &s;ee government at|tached to that in&s;titution. It is better to keep it for the be|nefit and promotion of trade and commerce.</P>
<P>The gentlemen who have &s;poken again&s;t the report, &s;eem to think it nece&s;&s;ary to introduce a popular topic, however little connection it has with the &s;ubject under debate. Pa|per money is &s;poken of largely. We are told that the paper money of the &s;tate cannot exi&s;t with the bank. Before they made this very bold a&s;&s;ertion, they &s;hould have known the extent of the emi&s;&s;ion of bank paper: but I dare affirm they could not even form a gue&s;s at its circulation that would not expo&s;e them. I would hazard the proof of this. So much ea&s;ier is it to make a&s;&s;ertions, than to produce proofs.</P>
<P>Among the charges again&s;t the bank, in the report of la&s;t year, is the interference and threats to reprobate the paper money of the &s;tate. This charge is founded on the memorial
<PB N="31" REF="019884_0034_0FAD41050C53A7A8">
of the committee of merchants, pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e while the bill for emitting the paper money was pending. A gentleman has told us that he believes this committee to be all bankers. To what extent this may be founded in fact, I cannot immediately determine. But &s;uppo&s;ing it true, if, becau&s;e they hold &s;tock in the bank, they are to be preclu|ded from giving their opinions on public mea&s;ures, we are in a &s;trange &s;ituation indeed. The crown of Great-Britain &s;ometimes di&s;mi&s;&s;es placemen, when they vote contrary to the court. But I did not expect to &s;ee a tyranny of this kind e&s;tabli&s;hed in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>Another argument I have heard alleged, is, that the of|ficers of the bank were bu&s;y at the late election. If being connected in the bank, were to deprive a per&s;on of the right of canva&s;&s;ing for his friends, I believe no man would wi&s;h to hold a &s;hare. No principle can be more de&s;tructive to li|berty than this.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Fayette county, has expre&s;&s;ed &s;ur|pri&s;e that I &s;hould differ in opinion, with re&s;pect to the ba|lance of trade, from the learned coun&s;el, who pleaded in favor of the bank before the late hou&s;e. I do not make pro|fe&s;&s;ion of a very exten&s;ive knowledge&mdash;but in matters of trade and commerce, I have had &s;ome experience, and do not u&s;ually commit my&s;elf without knowing the ground I &s;tand upon. I &s;hould be glad to be informed how the bank can po&s;&s;ibly facilitate the exportation of &s;pecie. It lends out money at &s;hort periods, at the end of which it mu&s;t be repaid, or the borrower forfeits his credit. Sometimes, through tenderne&s;s, the credit is prolonged.&mdash;But how this can be &s;aid to facilitate a drain of &s;pecie, is a my&s;tery to me. What mu&s;t be the &s;ituation of the bank, if that were the con&s;equence of the in&s;titution? It mu&s;t eventually be drain|ed, and if there were not money in the vaults, there mu&s;t be an end of the bank, and a de&s;truction of the charter, and of all per&s;ons concerned. But I a&s;&s;ert, that it does not fa|cilitate the export of &s;pecie.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Montgomery county (mr. Lollar) has made a curious ob&s;ervation&mdash;and many &s;uch have been made in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this bu&s;ine&s;s: he has &s;aid that the mer|chant abroad would not &s;o ea&s;ily procure ca&s;h for his goods, were it not for the bank. That the bank enables a man to pay his ju&s;t debts, is a charge I never expected to hear brought again&s;t it in a legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly. It can never be the inter|e&s;t of the &s;tate, that her credit &s;hould be lo&s;t. The &s;upport
<PB N="32" REF="019884_0035_0FAD41065DE7FD98">
of it tends to promote the advantage of every per&s;on in the country. Penn&s;ylvania is at pre&s;ent, and has been &s;ince its &s;ettlement, indebted to Europe: and that very circum&s;tance, &s;ingular as it may appear, has been highly beneficial. The capitals tru&s;ted by the Europeans to people here, have ena|bled them to build hou&s;es, and to improve the country. Can it then be proper to de&s;troy that credit? Surely the legi&s;la|ture will never &s;anction &s;uch a mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here mention a circum&s;tance, which would have come in with more propriety in another part of my di&s;cour&s;e. When gentlemen complain of the &s;carcity of money, and charge the bank with bani&s;hing the &s;pecie, they do not know or con&s;ider, that, of the &s;tock of the bank, 360,000 dollars belong to inhabitants of others of the united &s;tates, or of Eu|rope, and have been brought here merely by means of the bank. So that it clearly appears, that this in&s;titution, which has been &s;o frequently and &s;o unju&s;tly charged with facilitat|ing a drain of &s;pecie, has produced an effect directly the contrary.</P>
<P>The dangerous influence of the bank, is a topic much in|&s;i&s;ted on. This is a mere matter of &s;peculation, which it is very difficult to rea&s;on upon. The &s;tock-holders are about three hundred in number: they have different views and in|tere&s;ts, and are of different parties in politics&mdash;it is not likely, therefore, they can ever join in any &s;ingle mea&s;ure. How, then, this &s;o-much-dreaded influence can operate, it is not ea&s;y to conceive. I have already &s;aid that I am the only per&s;on in the direction of the bank, who have the ho|nor to fill a &s;eat in this hou&s;e: and I &s;hould hope that if there were no &s;uch in&s;titution, my election might be other|wi&s;e accounted for.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. After what has been offered by my col|leagues again&s;t the report made by the committee la&s;t year, I expected the gentlemen of that committee would have ri|&s;en, to vindicate it. But I find the conte&s;t is, who &s;hall have the la&s;t word. I &s;hall therefore alter the plan I propo|&s;ed to follow in this debate, and endeavour to an&s;wer the objections which have been rai&s;ed again&s;t the bank, before I proceed to the con&s;ideration of that report.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ob&s;ervation made by the gentleman from Fayette country, was, that we on this &s;ide the que&s;tion, are plead|ing the cau&s;e of our own intere&s;t. This I con&s;ider as an ap|peal to the feelings of the members, and a kind of &s;olicita|tion to pay little regard to what falls from us, as being par|ties
<PB N="33" REF="019884_0036_0FAD4106D7527968">
intere&s;ted in the deci&s;ion. This is neither fair nor can|did. Every member &s;hould have been left to judge for him|&s;elf, how far intere&s;t might influence our &s;entiments. I ac|knowledge my&s;elf intere&s;ted in the bank as a &s;tockholder. But I have no more &s;hare in the management, than that gentleman him&s;elf, unle&s;s when the &s;tockholders are called together. I feel my&s;elf intere&s;ted in the fate of the bank, from another cau&s;e. I had &s;ome hand in forming the in|&s;titution, or brat, as it has been called by &s;ome of its oppo|nents out of doors&mdash;now, &s;o far as I had a hand in the forma|tion of this brat, I e&s;teem my&s;elf bound in honour to &s;up|port it. I am induced al&s;o to &s;upport the report now be|fore the hou&s;e, becau&s;e I have a perfect and thorough con|viction, that the in&s;titution, in its operation, far from being injurious to the &s;tate, is of &s;ervice to every individual in it. It promotes the grandeur of the &s;tate&mdash;increa&s;es its wealth&mdash;and adds to its dignity.</P>
<P>If the argument of our being intere&s;ted in this que&s;|tion, were allowed the force it was meant to have, the &s;ame argument would apply on every que&s;tion. As a citizen and a freeman, entitled to all the privileges and im|munities which the laws and the con&s;titution afford, I am, more or le&s;s, intere&s;ted in the deci&s;ion of every que&s;tion that comes before this hou&s;e. This argument would in effect apply again&s;t every member in the hou&s;e. But I &s;hall quit this ground. As a member of this hou&s;e, I a&s;k and claim attention. If the arguments I &s;hall make u&s;e of, appear to ari&s;e from &s;elf-intere&s;t, they will of cour&s;e have but little weight: but, if founded on ju&s;t and equitable principles, I tru&s;t the members will be influenced by them as they de&s;erve&mdash;and I hope there is no man in this hou&s;e &s;o determined again&s;t the bank, but that he will alter his opinions, if &s;uffi|cient ground appears to warrant the alteration.</P>
<P>In the opening of this bu&s;ine&s;s, I objected to reading the memorial from the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank. It was pre&s;ented during the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, at a time when the par|ties intere&s;ted in that in&s;titution were &s;olicitous to have the matter brought before this hou&s;e. But during the late re|ce&s;s, there was a meeting of the &s;tockholders, at which it was determined to appeal to the judicial powers&mdash;and bring to an i&s;&s;ue at law, this que&s;tion&mdash;whether a charter once giv|en, can be annulled, without a forfeiture being proved? This being their re&s;olution, it appeared improper to pre&s;s the bu&s;ine&s;s forward in this hou&s;e on their part: and it was
<PB N="34" REF="019884_0037_0FAD4107F2CC8FF8">
agreed that it &s;hould not be re&s;umed here at their in&s;tance. However, in the mean time, their fellow-citizens took the mat|ter up; and by their numerous memorials, have put it in the power of the hou&s;e, to retrieve the dignity of the legi&s;lature, by repealing the late act. I, for my part, &s;hould have no he&s;itation to ri&s;que the que&s;tion in the courts of ju&s;tice. For though &s;ome of the judges, in their individual capacity, may have been oppo&s;ed to the bank, yet I have too much faith both in their integrity and in their regard for their law characters, to believe that they would hazard an unju&s;t de|ci&s;ion. Our judges, as judges, are, I tru&s;t, upright.</P>
<P>In an&s;wering the arguments alleged by the members op|po&s;ed to the adoption of the report now before the hou&s;e, I &s;hall endeavour to follow them as well as I can. The mem|ber from Montgomery county has told us, he regards the terms of the report, as a declaration of war, and a challenge to all the members of the late hou&s;e, who have &s;eats in the pre&s;ent. On this point I mu&s;t beg leave to differ from him. The committee of the former hou&s;e had been in&s;tructed to perform certain duties: the committee of the pre&s;ent hou&s;e di&s;covered and a&s;certained that they did not perform tho&s;e duties, and charged them accordingly with the failure. One of the members of the committee of the late hou&s;e has, in a great mea&s;ure, conceded the point, by acknowledging that they did not make the enquiries enjoined; and in ju&s;ti|fication he tells us, that the hou&s;e had a right to judge for it&s;elf. How then can a cen&s;ure levelled at the committee for non performance of duty, be con&s;trued to extend to tho&s;e members of that hou&s;e, who voted in conformity with their report, believing they had performed what had been en|joined them? I &s;hould think that tho&s;e members of the former hou&s;e, who have &s;eats in the pre&s;ent, by joining in the repeal of the law for taking away the charter of the bank, if they were led to vote for it by a report not founded in fact, would act more honourably and con&s;i&s;tently, than by per&s;i&s;ting in a defence of that law. If they be convinced that deception has been u&s;ed, there can be no di&s;honour in changing their opinions. It was therefore wrong to &s;tyle the report a declaration of war.</P>
<P>The gentleman went further. He &s;aid, if he were to pa&s;s reflections on the &s;ubject, it &s;hould be on that hou&s;e which granted the charter&mdash;not on that which repealed it. I have not examined the minutes of the hou&s;e which granted it, and therefore cannot tell whether or no he was a member. But
<PB N="35" REF="019884_0038_0FAD41080E89F838">
I venture to pronounce, that if he had been, he would have joined in granting it. The nece&s;&s;ities of the country loudly demanded that grant. I pre&s;ume he would not pa&s;s his cen&s;ures, but with re&s;pect to the term of the charter&mdash;as he appears to think its objectionable part, is the want of limitation as to time, and the great extent of capital the corporation is allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s. As to the limitation of time, he tells us, it was not under&s;tood by that hou&s;e which gave the charter, that it was to be for a perpetuity. To confirm this, he produces a clau&s;e propo&s;ed as a rider, in|troduced for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of limiting its duration, or to put it in the power of a future hou&s;e to do &s;o. He adds, that the argument adduced in &s;upport of the rejection of that rider, was, that the charter mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily always be within the power of the hou&s;e. But what is all this to us? Are we to regulate our conduct by the private opinions of the members of a former hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly? On this &s;ub|ject, I &s;hall further ob&s;erve, that they &s;eem to have changed &s;ides, on this que&s;tion: for the gentlemen oppo&s;ed to the bank at that period, were convinced that the hou&s;e could not attempt a repeal or alteration of the charter, unle&s;s an expre&s;s clau&s;e was in&s;erted for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Among other objections to the charter of the bank, brought by this gentleman, he alleged that the &s;tate had re|ceived no con&s;ideration for it. But this is an a&s;&s;ertion which cannot be &s;upported. The &s;tate received a very ample con|&s;ideration. However this is totally out of the que&s;tion. Are we to make &s;ale of our charters? Is there any con&s;ideration received for the numerous charters which this hou&s;e is con|tinually granting, and which employ a great proportion of our time? If any is received, I &s;hould be glad to know who gets the money. But we are not to &s;et up for &s;ale, characters which the con&s;titution authori&s;es us to grant for the good of our country.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman further tells us, he has a &s;trong ob|jection to the bank, becau&s;e it facilitates commerce. From this I pre&s;ume he is an enemy to all commerce, and thinks we would be better without it. I wi&s;h the gentleman had favoured us with an explanation of what he meant by facili|tating commerce. From what he has &s;aid, I imagine, that explanation would be, that the bank enables people to bring more goods into this country than they otherwi&s;e could do, which is di&s;advantageous. As to the theory of commerce, I do not pretend to be deeply ver&s;ed in it: but I have had &s;ome
<PB N="36" REF="019884_0039_0FAD41668A26F020">
experience in the practical part, and therefore I &s;hall go into a &s;hort inve&s;tigation of the &s;tate of our trade, &s;ince the peace concluded in 1783. At that period, the people of Europe, who&s;e attention had been drawn towards us by the arduous &s;truggle we had been engaged in, conceived the mo&s;t flattering golden dreams, with re&s;pect to this country. Af|ter &s;o long a war, they imagined we could have no manufac|tures, and that we were in want of every thing. He that could &s;end here quicke&s;t, it was thought, would the mo&s;t effectually reap the golden harve&s;t. This occa&s;ioned the im|men&s;e importation of goods which were poured into this country, from all quarters. Goods &s;o imported have been &s;old at &s;uch a great lo&s;s, that the trade has undergone a change and regulation from its own nature: and we &s;hall have no more of tho&s;e wild adventurers coming among&s;t us. How the bank facilitated tho&s;e gentlemen in the management of their bu&s;ine&s;s, I cannot a&s;certain. When they &s;old their goods, they received for them either money or produce. If they received money, they could certainly &s;hip it off without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the bank: and if they received produce, they could have no recour&s;e whatever to the bank. Perhaps the gentleman means, that if the bank had not afforded the fa|cility of procuring ca&s;h for exportation, they would have been glad to take produce. But admitting this for argument &s;ake, it would make no difference, unle&s;s he can &s;hew that any of our produce has peri&s;hed for want of being taken off our hands.</P>
<P>Another charge made again&s;t the bank is giving preference to favourites. This is an extraordinary kind of accu&s;ation to be made here. If the &s;tockholders, indeed, had cau&s;e, and were to bring that charge, there might be &s;ome proprie|ty in it. The money in the bank is the property of the &s;tockholders and depo&s;itors, who have confided the manage|ment of it to the directors, with a power to tru&s;t whom|&s;oever they &s;hall &s;ee fit: and the directors are accountable for their conduct to the &s;tockholders and depo&s;itors only. But &s;etting this a&s;ide, I maintain that the a&s;&s;ertion is fal&s;e. When it was made, it &s;hould have been proved. I now call upon the gentlemen oppo&s;ed to the bank, to prove the charge of partiality or favoriti&s;m.</P>
<P>Mr. Lollar &s;aid the directors were able to give tho&s;e pre|ferences &s;tated in the report of la&s;t year. He had not meant to charge them with having done &s;o&mdash;but to &s;tate how much was in their power in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="019884_0040_0FAD41675A91BA30">
Mr. R. Morris. In&s;inuations are one mode of making charges; and the wor&s;t mode: becau&s;e it is a very difficult matter to di&s;prove them. But I call on any man for proof, and I do not he&s;itate to affirm that none can be brought, I have &s;o much confidence in the fidelity of the directors.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Montgomery county, has told us that under the old government, when there were men in the ma|nagement of affairs as wi&s;e as any &s;ince, they had no idea of a bank&mdash;and that they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without it. The old go|vernment had no idea of an alliance with France: but this ob&s;ervation affords no argument again&s;t either the one or the other. However, though the old government had no idea of a bank, the commercial men of the province had: and I, as a merchant, laid the foundation of one; and e&s;tabli&s;hed a credit in Europe for the purpo&s;e. From the execution of this de&s;ign, I was prevented only by the revolution. This a&s;&s;ertion, therefore, like many others, is unfounded.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the bank, governor Pownal's eulogium on paper money and a loan office is quoted. I agree that the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a loan office, faithfully and properly conducted, is a wi&s;e mea&s;ure. But are a loan office and a bank incom|patible? No, they are not. A loan office, e&s;tabli&s;hed on proper principles, and on a good foundation, would pro|mote and encourage the landed intere&s;t, and operates as much in its favour, as a bank does in favour of commerce. The landed and commercial intere&s;t are as nearly allied here as in any country what&s;oever. If the country gentlemen are wil|ling, I will freely join in the creation of a capital in hard ca&s;h, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a loan office. The intere&s;ts of the bank can never interfere with theirs.</P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to a loan office, it &s;eems to be by many a&s;&s;umed as a principle, that it cannot be advantageous with|out paper money. True it is, it was formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed by means of a paper emi&s;&s;ion. But then the government was in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the confidence of the people: and paper money is the child of confidence&mdash;and of confidence alone. That confidence has been de&s;troyed&mdash;and it will require that during a number of years, the &s;overeign authority be ad|mini&s;tered with the mo&s;t rigid ju&s;tice, and the mo&s;t punctual compliance with all its engagements, before it can be re|gained.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted that this confidence has been regain|ed: and in &s;upport of the a&s;&s;ertion, we are told that the late emi&s;&s;ion of paper has been &s;ucce&s;sful. But I pledge my&s;elf,
<PB N="38" REF="019884_0041_0FAD4168713A99A0">
that if one hundred pounds in &s;pecie be &s;ent out of this hou&s;e, there may be procured for it, in le&s;s than an hour, 105, but in order to be within bounds, I will &s;ay 102&frac12;, or 103 pounds, in the paper money of the late emi&s;&s;ion. This I know to be a fact. Can that, therefore, be &s;aid to be mo|ney, which is an article of purcha&s;e and &s;peculation?</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall make one ob&s;ervation, tho' it &s;eems foreign to my &s;ubject: but it has been &s;ugge&s;ted by the idea of a loan office. I have &s;ome &s;hare in the landed intere&s;t&mdash;and hold a large quantity of lands within this &s;tate&mdash;I am willing to &s;ubmit to a tax to be paid in hard money, to e&s;tabli&s;h a fund for the purpo&s;e of lending &s;ums to farmers for the improve|ment of their lands. A farthing an acre on all the lands in the &s;tate, would &s;oon accumulate into a &s;olid capital fully adequate.</P>
<P>The member from Fayette county, has made an ob&s;erva|tion, which involves a kind of contradiction in it. He a&s;ks with a triumphant air, can the 2947 memoriali&s;ts in favour of the bank, be &s;aid to &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania? This is very different from the language held forth la&s;t year, when 1199 petitioners again&s;t the bank, though oppo&s;ed by 608 in its favour, were &s;aid to &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate. Now, if 1199, oppo&s;ed by 608, can at one time convey the &s;en&s;e of the community, 2947, without one per&s;on oppo&s;ed, may, by as fair a con&s;truction, be &s;aid to convey it at another. I wi&s;h the gentleman had amu&s;ed him&s;elf in looking over the names of the &s;igners; he would have &s;een, that to &s;tyle them re&s;pectable, as is done in the report, was not an error. He has &s;aid, this is holding out an ari&s;tocratical idea, and that there is no di&s;tinction of characters in Penn&s;ylvania. What! is it in&s;i&s;ted that there is no di&s;tinction of character? The re&s;pectability of tho&s;e &s;igners is not, as he has hinted, confined to property.&mdash;Surely per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of know|ledge, judgment, information, integrity, and having exten|&s;ive connections, are not to be cla&s;&s;ed with per&s;ons void of reputation or character&mdash;with criminals who infringe the laws, &amp;c. &amp;c.: for &s;uch we have among&s;t us: and if any one doubts it, he has only to ca&s;t his eyes to the other &s;ide of the &s;tate hou&s;e yard, towards the pri&s;on, and his doubts will be removed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman has given it as his opinion, that the number of &s;igners to the memorials, were procured by the influence and terrors of the bank. But this is not founded.
<PB N="39" REF="019884_0042_0FAD4168F1B572D8">
In no in&s;tance was a bu&s;ine&s;s of this kind more fairly con|ducted. The greater number of the memorials are conceiv|ed in one &s;tyle and form&mdash;every member of this hou&s;e mu&s;t know that they were publi&s;hed by tho&s;e who formed the de&s;ign, in the different new&s;papers in the city: &s;o that every man was able to judge of the contents before he was reque&s;t|ed to &s;ign. Does this &s;avour of undue influence or terror? But what are tho&s;e terrors? When money is &s;carce, and people much in want of it, it is a favour to obtain di&s;counts. The directors have never refu&s;ed an enemy of the bank, merely as &s;uch. Where, then, are tho&s;e terrors? Is it by re|fu&s;ing di&s;counts to tho&s;e who would not &s;ign, that tho&s;e ter|rors are to be excited. Look at the memorials, and &s;ee who has not &s;igned them. Few entitled to di&s;counts are not there. This charge of influence and terror, is not warranted by fact.</P>
<P>The gentleman went into a hi&s;tory of charters in the 13th and 14th centuries; and told us that &s;ome charters were &s;acred, becau&s;e they &s;ecured the natural rights of mankind: others were not, as being in favour of monopolies. By this, I &s;uppo&s;e he meant to in&s;inuate that the charter of the bank was a monopoly. I wi&s;h, that in&s;tead of confining him&s;elf to make this charge, he had endeavoured to &s;hew how it is a monopoly. If ever there was any room for the charge of monopoly, it was during the war: becau&s;e it was then re|commended by congre&s;s, that no other bank &s;hould be e&s;|tabli&s;hed, the exclu&s;ive operations of this being e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the united &s;tates.</P>
<P>Whatever weight there might have been in this, during the war, was entirely done away at the peace. But what is this monopoly? A right in the &s;tockholders to lend their own money to whom they plea&s;e. Does this hinder any other body of men from doing the &s;ame? If the rights of property are not of the nature of tho&s;e we receive from our creator, yet the &s;ecurity of them is among&s;t the great ob|jects of civil &s;ociety: and if in a government formed for protection of property, after the bank has been endowed with certain rights, privileges and immunities, the&s;e are not to be &s;acredly &s;ecured, the very end of government is violated. If there is the difference between charters, &s;tated by the gen|tleman, who is to be the judge which are to be held &s;acred, and which not? The con&s;titution has given no &s;uch power to the legi&s;lature: It has, indeed, authori&s;ed it to grant them: but not to take them away. Charters in Great Bri|tain are granted by the authority of the king, who cannot
<PB N="40" REF="019884_0043_0FAD416B85139368">
again re&s;ume them at plea&s;ure. It re&s;ts with the courts to determine whether or no they have been forfeited.</P>
<P>In order to ju&s;tify the conduct of the late hou&s;e, the gen|tleman has &s;uppo&s;ed that the legi&s;lature were to grant a mo|nopoly to five men, of our trade to Europe&mdash;to five others, of our trade to the Ea&s;t Indies&mdash;and to a third five, of our We&s;t India trade. But I a&s;k, how can he have recour&s;e to &s;uch a vague and idle &s;uppo&s;ition, or build any argument on it? If any legi&s;lature dare violate the mo&s;t undeniable rights of the community in &s;o flagrant a manner, their acts would be nugatory in them&s;elves. But what rights were in|vaded by giving the charter of incorporation to the bank? Any &s;et of men might apply for an act of incorporation for the &s;ame purpo&s;e to the legi&s;lature, who&s;e hands were not tied up by the one they had already granted. When a &s;et of gentlemen, oppo&s;ed to the pre&s;ent bank, and who thought to de&s;troy it, lately applied to the hou&s;e for a charter for another, the pre&s;ident and corporation of the bank in ex|i&s;tence, petitioned again&s;t their reque&s;t. And very proper|ly they did. If any &s;et of men were to apply to the legi&s;la|ture for a charter, which I thought injurious to my private intere&s;t, I &s;hould, if I had arguments of &s;ufficient weight to offer again&s;t it, make an appeal to the repre&s;entative body.</P>
<P>The gentleman has a&s;ked, to what purpo&s;e are our annual elections, if a &s;ucceeding hou&s;e has not power to correct the errors and mi&s;doings of a former one? It cannot be denied that they undertake to alter and change the acts of their predece&s;&s;ors&mdash;and in con&s;equence, we have had more doing and undoing &s;ince the revolution, than ever was known be|fore. This is much to be lamented. It &s;erves to de&s;troy the confidence of the people in the government. The late a&s;&s;embly had no nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;nor will they ever be ju&s;tified, for pa&s;&s;ing the repealing law.&mdash;This hou&s;e, I tru&s;t, is di&s;po&s;ed to render ju&s;tice to the injured, by annulling that law. Our con&s;tituents have &s;hewn their &s;en&s;e of the late repealing law, by the number of tho&s;e in favour of it, who have not been re-elected. Wherever a re-election took place, I am per|&s;uaded it aro&s;e from mi&s;repre&s;entations, by which the elec|tors were deceived: and I venture to pronounce, that, as the utility of the bank comes to be more generally known, and the &s;ubject better under&s;tood, every member who voted again&s;t it, will be di&s;carded by his con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>The gentleman frequently gives us little &s;craps from hi&s;to|ry; and I give him credit for his reading, which I am al|ways
<PB N="41" REF="019884_0044_0FAD416C9F6F0328">
ready to hear, and pay proper attention to, when it bears any analogy to, or runs parallel with the &s;ubject in de|bate. He has brought us an extract from the journals of the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of commons to prove that another people had &s;trong objections to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a bank. I wi&s;h I were deeper read&mdash;perhaps had there been no revolution, I &s;hould have been &s;o. I have read &s;ome hi&s;tory&mdash;but I will not tru&s;t my memory: On this occa&s;ion, however, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that in 1721, the period in which the que&s;tion of a bank was agitated in Ireland, the people of that country were in a &s;ituation very different from that of the people of Penn&s;ylvania at pre&s;ent. They were under the government of Great Britain, which held their commerce in trammels. They could hardly pretend to the enjoyment of liberty. This was, moreover, at a time when the public mind was agitated by bubbles of government, which were brought forth, and bur&s;t in different parts of Europe. The people, therefore, were afraid of every new &s;cheme. But if the Iri&s;h could have e&s;tabli&s;hed a bank, and had the manage|ment of it them&s;elves, they would have had no objection. After their late &s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggles for the recovery of their freedom, I am &s;ure they either have already, or will &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;h a bank among them. But Ireland is a country which does not boa&s;t of its wealth or commerce. It is a very good country for importing people, linen, and potatoes from&mdash;but I &s;hould not have looked to Ireland to import from thence commercial e&s;tabli&s;hments or precedents.</P>
<P>The propo&s;al to mortgage the revenues to the bank, has been held up in a very alarming point of view. But what was the amount of this propo&s;al? Merely that certain reve|nues &s;hould be appropriated to the payment of the intere&s;t of debts due by the united &s;tates to citizens of this &s;tate, and that the revenues devoted to that object &s;hould be mort|gaged to the bank. What were the terms of that mortgage? That &s;o long as government continued it, the bank &s;hould pay the intere&s;t punctually when due&punc; Is this, then, the ter|rible propo&s;ition, &s;o fraught with danger to the &s;tate? It is, indeed, as &s;trange a con&s;truction as ever I heard. And who was this propo&s;ition made by? By me, not by direc|tions of the bank&mdash;for I had none: not as a &s;tockholder, for I have no authority in their councils: but as a member of the committee of ways and means; in which &s;ituation it was not only my right, but my duty, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a propo&s;ition which I e&s;teemed &s;o highly advantageous to the &s;tate. In that view
<PB N="42" REF="019884_0045_0FAD416DC334C918">
I made it&mdash;its fate every body knows&mdash;I am apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome will have cau&s;e to lament it. But I hope not. From what I have &s;aid on this matter, it will clearly appear, that the propo&s;ition was made by an individual, not au|thori&s;ed for the purpo&s;e, and therefore &s;hould not injure the bank.</P>
<P>We are told, that the bank and the paper money of the &s;tate cannot exi&s;t together. But they do exi&s;t together. The bank exi&s;ts in full credit, although deprived of the countenance of the legi&s;lature: and the gentlemen in&s;i&s;t that the paper money is al&s;o in full credit: This a&s;&s;ertion, there|fore, is controverted by fact.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Fayette county, appears to be of opinion, that as we have found the paper money profitable, we &s;hould continue to emit it; and a&s;ks, how we could have paid the public creditors la&s;t year without the late emi&s;&s;ion? I an&s;wer they would have been better paid, if the paper mo|ney had not been emitted. It began to i&s;&s;ue from the trea|&s;ury in July la&s;t, by payments to the public creditors: and during the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;embly, in October, or Novem|ber, nearly the whole of it had found its way back again. The public creditors received it in payment of their de|mands&mdash;they paid their debts with it, or bought what they had occa&s;ion for: and it was brought into the trea&s;ury&mdash;not, I pre&s;ume, as a pledge or pre&s;ent&mdash;but in payment of taxes and impo&s;ts, which, had they been paid in proper time, would have lodged the &s;ame amount there in hard money, at lea&s;t as early as the paper was emitted, for payment of the public creditors; and would have prevented the nece&s;&s;ity of an anticipation of tho&s;e public revenues, which were at the time actually due. The paper money was emitted at a very great expence.&mdash;The public creditor received it, and was obliged to pa&s;s it at a le&s;s rate than its value&mdash;while the mer|chant was thereby enabled to pay off his impo&s;ts, and the taxable per&s;on his arrears, with le&s;s than their amount. How long &s;hall we go on robbing one part of the community to benefit the other?</P>
<P>The gentleman has &s;poken of the circulation of the late emi&s;&s;ion of paper money. This wants &s;ome explanation. The &s;um emitted was but &s;mall&mdash;and has been paid into the trea&s;ury nearly as fa&s;t as delivered out. The revenues of the &s;tate are &s;ufficient to en&s;ure the circulation of &s;uch a &s;um. But what &s;ecurity have we that the next hou&s;e of a&s;|&s;embly will not i&s;&s;ue another emi&s;&s;ion, and another? The
<PB N="43" REF="019884_0046_0FAD416E0A0C6EF8">
doubts and fears of this, and of tender laws, de&s;troy the confidence of the public. While the&s;e doubts remain in the minds of the people, the circulation of paper mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be quick, as no one will ri&s;que the keeping it long by him.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid of the oppo&s;ition given by the bank to the late emi&s;&s;ion of paper money. I acknowledge that I gave it oppo&s;ition&mdash;but that was before the law pa&s;&s;ed. I defy any per&s;on to prove I have given it any &s;ince. Such has been the line of conduct pur&s;ued by my friends. Re|garding it as a mea&s;ure not calculated for the public good, we thought it our duty to oppo&s;e it, while there were hopes of preventing it. But afterwards, when the bill had pa&s;&s;ed, we dropped our oppo&s;ition: as it is the duty of good citi|zens to follow, when they cannot lead.</P>
<P>It has been argued that the bank is prejudicial to agricul|ture and improvements; that it has been the cau&s;e of the high rate of intere&s;t; and that u&s;ury was unknown before its e&s;tabli&s;hment. The&s;e are very heavy charges indeed&mdash;but they are not founded in fact. By what means can the bank injure agriculture? If di&s;counts are injurious to it, then, indeed, the bank may be arraigned. But how are di&s;counts injurious to agriculture? I &s;ay they are u&s;ed on many occa&s;ions, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of encouraging agriculture, if affording to tho&s;e that want to purcha&s;e the produce of the country, the means to make &s;uch purcha&s;es, when they could not otherwi&s;e accompli&s;h them, be an en|couragement. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a &s;hip arrives here from the We&s;t Indies with a cargo of rum and &s;ugars, belonging or con|&s;igned to &s;ome one of our merchants, who has not an oppor|tunity to di&s;po&s;e of tho&s;e articles immediately. It is preju|dicial to have the ve&s;&s;el detained&mdash;yet though he has value in his &s;tores, he cannot procure money to purcha&s;e flour, to load her. In this &s;ituation, if there be no bank, there is no redre&s;s. This is by no means ideal. I have frequently experienced it my&s;elf. The hou&s;e with which I was connect|ed, have often had abundance of goods in their &s;tores and magazines, and been unable to procure &s;pecie to lade their ve&s;&s;els. At this cri&s;is, the bank &s;teps forward, and if the merchant has evidence of property in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he pro|cures credit&mdash;purcha&s;es produce&mdash;and &s;ends off his ve&s;&s;el. This is the facility the bank gives to commerce. Without it the farmer and merchant would be equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: the former would have his waggons waiting in Market-&s;treet,
<PB N="44" REF="019884_0047_0FAD416ECEBA0118">
and no &s;ale; while the latter would have abundance of rum, mahogany, logwood, dry goods, &amp;c. in his &s;tores, none of which, perhaps, the other would have occa&s;ion for. But by means of the bank, the merchant is enabled to pur|cha&s;e, and the farmer to return home.</P>
<P>The high rate of intere&s;t has entirely ari&s;en from the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of per&s;ons in want of money, who either had no cre|dit at the bank, or run through what they had. They were then obliged to make application to u&s;urers, who&s;e enormous demands ro&s;e in proportion to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their victims. Thus has intere&s;t mounted from &frac12; to 2 and 5 per cent per month. But did the bank take this intere&s;t? No. Did it encourage tho&s;e who took it? No. As fa&s;t as they became known, they were refu&s;ed di&s;counts. Why then charge the in&s;titution with what it has a direct tendency to prevent?</P>
<P>The extraordinary profits of the bank, we are told, not only prevent people from purcha&s;ing hou&s;es, lots and lands, but even induce tho&s;e who have them, to &s;ell. But &s;urely tho&s;e extraordinary profits are as much the object of one man as another&mdash;and if one wants to &s;ell on that account, who will be found to buy?&mdash;I have, however, authority for &s;aying, that the profits of the bank do not exceed, on an average, 7&frac34; or 8 per cent. per annum, which would never be &s;ufficient inducement to hold &s;tock, if there were no other con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>"The bank," a gentleman has &s;aid, "has not &s;uffered by the lo&s;s of its charter. The &s;tockholders," added he, "have already gained enough." To this I an&s;wer, that the bank has &s;uffered in the only way in which the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tate could injure it. And if this hou&s;e re&s;tore the charter, they will not re&s;tore what the late hou&s;e took away. It con|tinues to po&s;&s;e&s;s, it is true, the confidence of the citizens of Philadelphia&mdash;and of the neighbouring &s;tates&punc; but before the late attack made on it, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the confidence of the mo|nied men in Europe. This it has in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t: and this it will find difficult to regain.</P>

<P>RESUMED the con&s;ideration of the report of the com|mittee, to whom were referred the memorials praying a repeal or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the law annulling the charter of the bank.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. I was in hopes, that after the many ar|guments made u&s;e of on the part of the bank, &s;ome of the gentlemen in oppo&s;ition, would have ri&s;en in reply: but I &s;ee they are determined to re&s;erve them&s;elves for the la&s;t blow. I &s;hall therefore try to provoke an an&s;wer, by offering &s;uch further arguments as occur to me, on the &s;ubject under our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The bill, which was enacted into a law, by the late hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, repealing the charter of the bank, was brought in, in con&s;equence of a report made by a committee of that hou&s;e, which had been in&s;tructed to enquire and a&s;certain, whether the charges made by certain petitioners again&s;t the bank, were true or not. Knowing that this que&s;tion would come before the hou&s;e, I was prepared to a&s;k the members of that committee, whether &s;uch enquiry had been made? and if it had, when and where it was made, and what had been the re&s;ult? But the committee of the pre&s;ent hou&s;e have &s;aved me that trouble; they have a&s;certained and &s;tated in the preamble of their report, that no &s;uch enquiry was made. The only member of the committee of the late hou&s;e who has &s;poken in the pre&s;ent debate, has told us, that even &s;uppo&s;ing the committee had not made the enquiry, the hou&s;e might with propriety take up the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of their report: by which he has conceded the point as to any enquiries having been made.&mdash;The nece&s;&s;ary enquiries not having been made, I would a&s;k, how the committee came by the opinion given in their report, "that the bank is in every view incompatible with the public &s;afety?"</P>
<P>Here mr. Gray called mr. Morris to order. He declared he was unea&s;y to hear the conduct not only of the late hou&s;e, but of their committee impeached. It was, in his idea, entirely improper, and not the &s;it mode of conducting the bu&s;ine&s;s. He was unintere&s;ted in the que&s;tion, &s;o far as it related to their conduct, having had no hand either in granting or revoking the charter of the bank but was de|cidedly of opinion, that if one hou&s;e undertook to impeach the conduct of another, it would lead into endle&s;s difficul|ties. There was no other tribunal e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;ti|tution, with the powers nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e, than the
<PB N="46" REF="019884_0049_0FAD4170591BEEC8">
council of cen&s;ors. That body would, at a future day, de|termine on the conduct of the late hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly. The member was perfectly out of order.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. I have been called to order very impro|perly and indecently: the que&s;tion pending before this hou&s;e, is, whether or no an act of the former hou&s;e &s;hall be re|pealed? How is it po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cu&s;s this que&s;tion, without &s;peaking of the conduct of that hou&s;e? Several other mem|bers who have gone before me, have taken the &s;ame ground I have proceeded upon, and have arraigned the conduct of the late hou&s;e and of their committee&mdash;they were not called to order: why then am I &s;ingled out? Do I not po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame rights and privileges as other members? The gentleman has not &s;hewn that I was not in order.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie &s;aid, the gentleman from Philadelphia county [mr. Gray] was certainly right. The member had been out of order. He added, that he would venture to &s;ay, &s;uch a report as that under debate, had never been produced in any a&s;&s;embly. However, he had no objection to a free and full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the conduct of the late hou&s;e, and of their com|mittee&mdash;as, &s;o far from &s;uffering by it&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the Speaker interfered. He &s;aid on a que&s;tion of order, there could not be any debate allowed. If the gen|tleman who had called the member from the city to order, wi&s;hed to take the &s;en&s;e of the hou&s;e, he would put the que&s;tion: otherwi&s;e the member mu&s;t be permitted to pro|ceed without interruption.</P>
<P>Mr. Gray declining to have the &s;en&s;e of the hou&s;e taken,</P>
<P>Mr. Morris proceeded thus: Had the committee of the late hou&s;e been charged with neglect of duty, with a view of bringing them to trial before this hou&s;e, as the gentleman &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, he would have been right in giving oppo|&s;ition to &s;uch proceeding, and I &s;hould have joined him; but that is by no means the ca&s;e. The &s;ubject before us, re|quires an inve&s;tigation of the conduct of the late hou&s;e, and that of their committee which made the report, whereon was founded the law for annulling the charter of the bank: re&s;pecting their conduct, and on every part of it, I have a right to &s;peak my &s;entiments, provided they are delivered in a manner not incon&s;i&s;tent with any privileges of this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The report made by the &s;aid committee, declares, as I &s;aid before, <Q>That the bank is in every view incompatible
<PB N="47" REF="019884_0050_0FAD41742EA55C48">
with the public &s;afety.</Q> I a&s;k was that committee either able or willing to con&s;ider the &s;ubject in every view? I do not he&s;itate to pronounce <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. Did that committee take a view of the &s;ervices which the bank had rendered to the united &s;tates? I believe they did not; and yet that was one of the points of view in which they ought to have con&s;idered it: for when chartered rights are to be de&s;troyed, the matter &s;hould really be con&s;idered in every point of view. As the committee did not choo&s;e to make mention of tho&s;e &s;ervices, many of which mu&s;t have been known to them, I &s;hall, I tru&s;t, be excu&s;ed for giving &s;ome little account of them.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 178<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, the money and credit of the united &s;tates were at &s;o low an ebb, that &s;ome mem|bers of the board of war declared to me&punc; that they had not the means of &s;ending an expre&s;s to the army. I mention this only as one in&s;tance, to &s;hew that di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of our finances, which induced congre&s;s to make the appointment of a &s;uperintendent, which was done in the month of Fe|bruary in that year: and a &s;till &s;tronger proof of our di&s;tre&s;s will be &s;hewn, by a bare mention, that a motion was, about the time of that appointment, made in congre&s;s, by an honour|able delegate from the &s;tate of Virginia, to authori&s;e general Wa&s;hington to &s;eize all the provi&s;ions that could be found within a circle of twenty miles round his camp. The motion having been &s;ubmitted to me, as &s;uperintendent elect, I reque&s;ted that it might be withdrawn, and pledged my&s;elf to procure, upon my private credit, a &s;upply of four or five thou&s;and barrels of flour, in a &s;hort time, for the u&s;e of the army; and I was happy enough to &s;ucceed in the attempt. The various &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, and the extreme difficulties which pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my view at that time, were &s;ufficient to have deterred any man from the ac|ceptance of &s;uch an appointment; but, however unequal to the &s;tation, the attempt was indi&s;pen&s;ible. I found it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, previous to the acceptance, to make certain &s;tipulations, as leading to the only po&s;&s;ible chance of &s;ucce&s;s: among&s;t the&s;e was that of not being liable to make good the previous engagements taken on account of the united &s;tates, well knowing that &s;uch demands mu&s;t &s;oon have run me down&mdash;Another &s;tipulation was made with the mini&s;ter of France, for a credit upon the king's trea&s;ury, which was granted in a very limited degree. That mini&s;ter did not want inclination to go greater lengths; but I have rea&s;on to
<PB N="48" REF="019884_0051_0FAD41755B0A39D8">
believe, that he was limited by in&s;tructions, both as to the &s;um and terms of the loan; terms which it may be impro|per for me to mention here, although they would add ano|ther proof of our then mi&s;erable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>This credit, however, and the confidence repo&s;ed in me by the then legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, laid the foundation for appreciating the paper money of this &s;tate, and enabled me to feed and move the army during the remainder of the year 1781. I was happy enough to find that a&s;&s;embly di&s;|po&s;ed to give every po&s;&s;ible aid to tho&s;e de&s;igns which were then formed for promoting the public &s;ervice. The execu|tive branch of government was equally well di&s;po&s;ed. I have now a gentleman in my eye who then pre&s;ided: he knows the applications I was obliged to make; he gave ready com|pliance as far as he could, and I feel a plea&s;ure in bearing this public te&s;timony to his exertions at the time.&mdash;Under the pre&s;&s;ure of tho&s;e difficulties I have mentioned, the idea of a public or national bank &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf, as a mea&s;ure that might be extremely u&s;eful in my attempts to regain for the united &s;tates, that credit which had been lo&s;t. I made the propo&s;al for e&s;tabli&s;hing it to congre&s;s, which met their approbation. Every one knows the terms on which it was offered to the public: and yet from the month of May, when the propo&s;als were publi&s;hed, until the month of Sep|tember or October following, there were not more &s;ub&s;crip|tions in the whole, than amounted to about &s;eventy thou&s;and dollars. During this time, one of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;|ty's frigates arrived at Bo&s;ton, and brought a remittance in &s;pecie of about four hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and dollars. This &s;um was brought to Philadelphia, and depo&s;ited in the vaults of the bank. I determined from the moment of its arrival, to &s;ub&s;cribe on behalf of the united &s;tates, for tho&s;e &s;hares in the bank which remained vacant; but &s;uch was the amount of the public expenditures, that, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t care and caution to keep this money, nearly one half of the &s;um was exhau&s;ted before the in&s;titution could be organized. In November 1781, the pre&s;ident and direc|tors of the bank were elected; they obtained a charter of incorporation from congre&s;s&mdash;and opened the bank for tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s in January 1782. I &s;ub&s;cribed the &s;um then remaining in the trea&s;ury, being about 254,000 dollars, into the bank &s;tock, for account of the united &s;tates, which became thereby the principal &s;tockholders. And I &s;hall now read an extract taken upon this occa&s;ion, from <Q>a &s;tate|ment
<PB N="49" REF="019884_0052_0FAD4175934E2768">
of the accounts of the united &s;tates of America, during the admini&s;tration of the &s;uperintendent of finance,</Q> which was made out and publi&s;hed before my re&s;ignation, intended for the information of my fellow-citizens, and de|po&s;ited in the trea&s;ury office, under an expectation that the books would have been di&s;tributed or &s;old: why they have been with-held from the public eye, I do not know; I meant them for public inve&s;tigation; and, as the officer con|cerned feared none that could be made into my conduct. It lies with tho&s;e who have with-held the books, to account for it.</P>
<P>This extract &s;tates, that on the fir&s;t of April 1782, the united &s;tates po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;tock in the bank, to the amount of 252, 918 28-90 dollars; and that they were then indebted for money borrowed of the bank, 300,000 dollars, by which it appears, that if this in&s;titution had not taken place, the trea&s;ury would have been 50,000 dollars wor&s;e than nothing.</P>
<P>The requi&s;itions of congre&s;s, for 8,000,000 of dollars, which were pa&s;&s;ed the preceding November, required no payment from the &s;tates until May: and it is well known, that long after that time, they produced no effect: at that period, public credit had gone to wreck; and the enemy built their mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of overcoming us, upon this circum&s;tance; but at that cri&s;is our credit was re&s;tored by the bank.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of July 1782, the united &s;tates held to the amount of 253,000 28-90 dollars in bank &s;tock, and were then indebted to the bank 400,000 dollars, which is nearly 150,000 dollars more than the amount of their &s;aid &s;tock. I am &s;en&s;ible that by mentioning the&s;e tran&s;actions, I expo&s;e the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank to the only cen&s;ure that can affect them. The then &s;tockholders might with &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on have complained that they had extended their credit to the united &s;tates too far beyond the bounds of di&s;cretion: but let it be con&s;idered, that they were told, and truly told, by him that pre&s;ided over the finances, that the fate of their country depended very much upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance required from time to time at their hands. Their de&s;ire to render public &s;ervice, and their confidence in the a&s;&s;urance given repeatedly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> faithful repayment, will &s;urely ju&s;tify <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> ri&s;qued a part of the property confided to them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ecurity of the whole: but, even &s;uppo&s;ing any cen&s;ure to lie, how far &s;uch cen&s;ure will ju&s;tify the pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e con|cerned
<PB N="50" REF="019884_0053_0FAD417663BB4B08">
in the attack upon the bank, I leave to the deci&s;ion of every gentleman pre&s;ent. In October 1782, the united &s;tates continued, as before, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of bank &s;tock for 253,394 58-90 dollars, and indebted 400,000 dollars. Be|fore January 1783, the pre&s;ident and directors growing ra|ther unea&s;y at this heavy loan, and fearing cen&s;ure, they called upon me for relief, and I &s;old out &s;tock of the united &s;tates to the amount of 200,000 dollars, and paid 300,000 dollars in part of the debt: &s;o that on the fir&s;t of January 1783, the united &s;tates held &s;tock for 53,394 58-90 dollars, and owed the bank, 100,000 dollars.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of April following, the &s;ituation remained the &s;ame. By the fir&s;t of July, I had &s;old the whole of the bank &s;tock belonging to the united &s;tates, and they remained in debt to the bank, 129,800 dollars. On the fir&s;t of Oc|tober 1783, this debt was encrea&s;ed to 164,781: but by the fir&s;t of January 1784, the united &s;tates were di&s;charged of that debt.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident and directors of the bank had no pledge after the &s;ale of the &s;tock, for the debt of the united &s;tates, other than that of the public faith given in proper writings by their officer. During the&s;e times of di&s;tre&s;s and want, the utility of the bank was not confined to the advances made to the &s;uperintendent for public &s;ervice. It was emi|nently beneficial, by extending di&s;counts to contractors who &s;upplied the army with provi&s;ions, and to others concerned in tru&s;ting articles nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upplies of the various public departments; &s;ometimes the notes were di&s;counted upon public, and &s;ometimes upon private credit. I have fre|quently been obliged to take the contractors' notes to me for the &s;ums due to them, and endor&s;e &s;uch notes in my private capa|city, &s;o that they might obtain di&s;counts on tho&s;e notes to pay them&s;elves: by the&s;e, and &s;uch other means as could then be devi&s;ed, anticipations were effected, until public monies could be collected to di&s;charge the notes. Some members of this hou&s;e know, and can vouch the truth of this relation; one in particular, who contracted with me for feeding the troops and pri&s;oners at Reading, on very moderate terms, who gave great &s;atisfaction in the execution, got but little profit, but always appeared well plea&s;ed with the opportu|nity of being &s;o far u&s;eful to his country. This gentleman mu&s;t remember the&s;e things well.</P>
<P>From the aids given by this in&s;titution, the united &s;tates were enabled to keep up, feed, and clothe an army, con&s;i&s;t|ing
<PB N="51" REF="019884_0054_0FAD41771E1C6B78">
of a larger number of men than they had had in the field before, or than they could have maintained without the&s;e aids. This army was, in every point, on a much more re|&s;pectable footing than formerly, and they kept the enemy at bay.</P>
<P>And &s;hall this in&s;titution, from which, not only the united &s;tates, but this &s;tate, as a member of the union, hath derived &s;uch &s;olid advantages, lo&s;e all its merit and credit, by the report of a committee of the late hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, &s;tating opinions, un&s;upported by a &s;ingle fact? Had the com|mittee called upon me, I would have given them this infor|mation, and given it upon oath, if required. Nay, I am even now ready, if nece&s;&s;ary, to quit my &s;eat as a member, and appear at the bar of this hou&s;e, to prove the truths I have advanced.</P>
<P>I now appeal to that gentleman, who has a&s;&s;erted, that this &s;tate has received no con&s;ideration for the charter granted to the bank, whether her &s;hare of &s;ervices and credit derived from it, was not an ample con&s;ideration? Every per&s;on who hears me, will, I doubt not, agree that it was. I will not, however, advocate the cau&s;e of the bank, merely from pa&s;t &s;ervices; but will try to &s;hew, that it may al&s;o be u&s;eful to the public in time to come.</P>
<P>The report &s;ays, the bank has a direct tendency to bani&s;h a great part of the &s;pecie from this country. From what information the committee derived this knowledge, or whe|ther it was in&s;tinctive, I cannot pretend to decide. But I maintain that it has a direct contrary tendency. The money of the &s;tockholders and depo&s;itors is drawn into its vortex, and how is it to be got out of their cellars?&mdash;The directors will not certainly give it away&mdash;they lend it but for &s;hort pe|riods, and few of tho&s;e borrowers would ri&s;que a &s;hipment of money which mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon be repaid. Formerly, when a &s;hip was put up for London, the remitters who wi&s;hed to &s;hip &s;pecie, were obliged, if they had not the money, to ca&s;t about for ways and means of obtaining it, either by borrowing or buying of their neighbours and acquaintance, and away it went if they &s;ucceeded. At pre&s;ent, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, the remitters are obliged to make application to the bank for di&s;counts: but the directors being intere&s;ted to ob&s;truct the &s;hipments of money, and knowing tho&s;e who want di&s;|counts for that purpo&s;e, they watch them as clo&s;ely as a cat does a mou&s;e, and refu&s;e &s;uch di&s;counts until the &s;hip is
<PB N="52" REF="019884_0055_0FAD4177DA2CF168">
gone. Such refu&s;als may po&s;&s;ibly have given ri&s;e, in part, to the charge of partiality. The directors, knowing how inju|rious the exportation of &s;pecie is to the operations of the bank, will not lend money for exportation. No con&s;idera|ble &s;ums can be &s;ought after or obtained for this purpo&s;e, without their being aware of it; the experience and habits they have acquired in the cour&s;e of their management, en|able them to perceive the approaching evil; and they en|deavour to counteract and ob&s;truct it, as &s;oon as di&s;covered. Thus, although they cannot prevent the exportation of &s;pe|cie, they render it far more difficult than it would otherwi&s;e be, and con&s;equently the bank has no tendency to bani&s;h the &s;pecie. The report of la&s;t year, therefore, &s;o far as it is grounded on this charge, is grounded on a fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>This report proceeds to tell us, that the bank, after ba|ni&s;hing a great part of the &s;pecie of the country, collects nearly the whole of the remainder into the hands of the &s;tockholders. How this can come to pa&s;s, it is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain. Every &s;ix months a dividend is made of the pro|fits of the bank: and if we reflect who are the &s;tockholders, we &s;hall find it mo&s;t probable that the dividends are devoted to their current expences, for the &s;upport of them&s;elves and families, and by that means circulated again among&s;t the com|munity. At any rate, the &s;tock cannot increa&s;e by means of the profits, unle&s;s new &s;hares are purcha&s;ed, which can|not now be done. And if it were to be done, the number of &s;tockholders would increa&s;e with the number of &s;hares &s;old: con&s;equently the charge of accumulating the wealth of the &s;tate, into the hands of a few individuals, falls to the ground.</P>
<P>The report goes on to &s;tate, <Q>That the accumula|tion of enormous wealth in the hands of a &s;ociety who claim perpetual duration, will nece&s;&s;arily produce a degree of influence and power, which cannot be en|tru&s;ted in the hands of any &s;et of men what&s;oever, without endangering the public &s;afety.</Q> How is this accumulation of enormous wealth to take place? If an individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es one &s;hare in the bank &s;tock, it cannot accumulate: it will always remain one &s;hare: for the pro|fits are divided and drawn out half yearly. An increa&s;e of the number of &s;tockholders, increa&s;es the number of &s;hares; and by experience has been found to reduce tho&s;e profits. What then is meant by this accumulation? this influence?
<PB N="53" REF="019884_0056_0FAD4178C9C9EBA0">
They are mere bugbears, held out to terrify the ignorant and un&s;u&s;pecting members of the community.</P>
<P>If, indeed, it is meant, that by the &s;ale of more &s;hares, the pre&s;ident and directors will have the management of more money than while the &s;tock is confined and &s;mall, I grant it&punc; and the con&s;equence would be, that they could, with a larger capital, be more u&s;eful. As to influence, it may be depended upon as a fact, that if ever &s;uch an in&s;titution could create influence, this bank has had the opportunity from January 1782, to the pre&s;ent time: and who has &s;een or felt this influence during that period? But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch an influence to exi&s;t, how far could it go? it could only extend to tho&s;e who &s;hould be under a nece&s;&s;ity to borrow; and only &s;o long as it &s;hould be con&s;idered a favour to ob|tain loans. Had this in&s;titution been let alone, the confi|dence it had obtained, would &s;oon have procured &s;uch an increa&s;e of &s;tockholders and &s;tock, as would have turned the tables: and in&s;tead of its being deemed a favour to ob|tain loans at the bank, the directors would have been glad to receive applications for them, from men of proper cre|dit: and as the capital increa&s;ed, they would not only have been enabled to accommodate the public more generally, but it might have &s;o happened, that they would have had it in their power to lend to farmers for the improvement of their lands.</P>
<P>Has any of this much-dreaded influence &s;hewn it&s;elf in the legi&s;lature? I an&s;wer, no. If any member will &s;ay yes, let him &s;hew when&mdash;let him &s;hew how&mdash;let him produce evi|dence of the fact. But if &s;uch influence did exi&s;t, is it po&s;|&s;ible that it could extend beyond the bounds of the city? One of my worthy colleagues and my&s;elf are &s;tockholders, and gentlemen affect to &s;uppo&s;e we are under this influence: this is con&s;idering the matter in the wor&s;t point of view. But for the &s;ake of argument, if we admit it for a moment, how far does our influence go? We offer our &s;entiments on vari|ous occa&s;ions: we urge rea&s;ons and arguments which we, at lea&s;t, think ought to have weight, and to carry con|viction. But if the&s;e arguments are offered again&s;t a certain &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures, there are certain gentlemen from the country, who po&s;&s;e&s;s a kind of magic, which produces much greater effect than our rea&s;oning. We carry very few points again&s;t this magic charm: and with a vote on the que&s;tion, our influence is ended.</P>

Were it under the control of govern|ment, the people would withdraw their confidence; and neither &s;tockholders or depo&s;itors would be found to tru&s;t their money under &s;uch control. Gentlemen may &s;ay what they plea&s;e of the credit of government; but the fact is, that &s;uch credit is not obtained. Government ought to have credit: and no man wi&s;hes more than I do, to &s;ee it e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, but not through this channel. If government, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, could control the funds of the bank, and were to apply them to the u&s;e of the &s;tate, how &s;hould an individual, who&s;e money was taken by &s;uch au|thority, obtain &s;atisfaction? Should he go to law with the &s;tate? No; the government has too much power, and he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to what it &s;hould dictate. But if the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank abu&s;e their tru&s;t, and mi&s;apply his money, the law is &s;tronger than they are: and the law will give him relief.</P>
<P>The report continues, <Q>The great profits of the bank, which will daily increa&s;e as money grows &s;carcer, and which already far exceed the profits of European banks, have tempted foreigners to ve&s;t their money in this bank, thus to draw from us large &s;ums for intere&s;t.</Q> The com|mittee might as well have &s;tated, that the profits of a mill increa&s;e in proportion to the &s;carcity of corn, by which it lo&s;es the toll, as that the profits of the bank will increa&s;e as money grows &s;carcer: for money is the life and &s;oul of a bank, and as nece&s;&s;ary as plenty of corn is to a mill. The fir&s;t part of this clau&s;e has, therefore, no foundation in truth: and as to that part relative to foreigners taking away our &s;pecie, in payment of the intere&s;t or dividends which will ari&s;e on their &s;tock, I am glad of the opportunity of en|tering into the con&s;ideration of it, having heard it fre|quently urged by &s;en&s;ible men as a grievance, that this coun|try &s;hould pay dividends to foreigners, which they con&s;ider as a kind of tribute. I &s;hall remark, by the way, that when foreigners place money in the bank for the purcha&s;e of &s;tock, it proves that in&s;tead of facilitating the export of &s;pecie, the in&s;titution has a tendency to draw it into this country.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="019884_0058_0FAD417DD649BFE0">
I a&s;&s;ert, that it is the intere&s;t of this country to borrow money from abroad, and pay either intere&s;t, or bank divi|dends for the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Did the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of America bring capitals with them! Some few individuals might: but the generality certainly did not: if they could accompli&s;h the bringing the nece&s;&s;ary implements of hu&s;bandry, it was doing a great deal. The &s;ettlers that have continued to follow the fir&s;t comers, from that time to this, were in the &s;ame way: very few have brought capitals; and yet nearly all have grown rich. How did this happen? It has happened by the u&s;e of European capitals. How were the&s;e obtained for that u&s;e? Not by borrowing money; for they could not, it is true, obtain &s;uch loans: if they could, the country would have grown rich much fa&s;ter. But they borrowed goods. America has ri&s;en to opulence by means of the credit &s;he obtained in Eu|rope. The goods &s;o borrowed, or, in other words, bought upon credit, were not procured on the &s;ame ea&s;y terms, on which money is u&s;ually lent. It would have been much bet|ter for the traders in America, to borrow money at &s;ix, eight, ten per cent. or at any rate of dividend made by the bank, and to have purcha&s;ed their goods with the ready money &s;o borrowed: for with ready money, tho&s;e purcha&s;es might have been made, ten, fifteen, twenty, and perhaps in &s;ome articles, thirty per cent. cheaper than on credit.</P>
<P>It is true, that the merchants in England u&s;ually &s;hipped goods on one year's credit, without charging intere&s;t for that year. But it has been always &s;aid, and in &s;ome in&s;tances proved upon trials in the courts of law, that the year's in|tere&s;t is amply compen&s;ated by the advances put on the real co&s;t of the goods, be&s;ides other benefices derived by the Eng|li&s;h merchant, by means of drawbacks, di&s;counts, &amp;c. &amp;c. And if the American importer cannot pay at the expiration of the twelve months, an intere&s;t account commences, and is continued in &s;uch manner, that he pays at the rate of compound intere&s;t, until the debt is di&s;charged. Under the&s;e di&s;advantages, the credit, obtained in Europe, at a rate of intere&s;t equal to fifteen, twenty, or perhaps thirty per cent. has been the foundation of that pro&s;perity which we behold in America. That credit has been extended by the importer to the country &s;hopkeeper; and, through him, to the farmer and mechanic, who being thereby enabled to pur&s;ue their labours, have drawn produce from the &s;urface and bowels of the earth, which has not only defrayed the
<PB N="56" REF="019884_0059_0FAD417E8F813D00">
whole of the co&s;t and charges, but enriched the indu&s;trious. Mu&s;t not, then, an in&s;titution which draws money from Europe for the u&s;e of our citizens, at the rate of 7 3 4ths or 8 per cent. be extremely beneficial? Could America by means of &s;uch in&s;titutions, or by any other means, obtain loans &s;ufficient to enable her to purcha&s;e all the goods wanted from Europe, with ready money, &s;he would find a va&s;t and la&s;t|ing advantage in it. The plan and utility of a loan office are pretty well under&s;tood&mdash;A farmer borrows at that office at the rate of &s;ix per cent. per annum intere&s;t&mdash;this enables him to improve his land to the be&s;t advantage: and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> well directed indu&s;try, he rai&s;es annually from that land an in|come exceeding the rate of intere&s;t, which &s;oon enables him to di&s;charge the debt, and enrich him&s;elf. In like manner, if we can create a credit in Europe, and borrow at &s;ix, eight, or ten per cent, &s;o long as &s;uch loans can be em|ployed to rai&s;e an income exceeding the intere&s;t paid, we en|rich our&s;elves by the difference. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank had created that credit in &s;ome degree: and Penn&s;yl|vania, &s;o long as her citizens can derive a better income from the capitals of Europeans ve&s;ted in our bank &s;tock, than tho&s;e Europeans derive from the dividends, ought to hold out encouragement for an increa&s;e of &s;uch &s;tockholders, rather than pur&s;ue mea&s;ures for dimini&s;hing their &s;hares.</P>
<P>The report proceeds&mdash;<Q>Foreigners will doubtle&s;s be more and more induced to become &s;tockholders, until the time may arrive, when this engine of power may become &s;ubject to foreign influence. This country may be agi|tated with the politics of European courts, and the good people of America reduced once more to a &s;tate of &s;ub|ordination and dependence upon &s;ome one or other of the European powers.</Q> This conveys a mo&s;t extraor|dinary po&s;ition; that foreigners, by depo&s;iting their money with us, &s;hall become our enemies, and &s;eek our de&s;truction; and that tho&s;e who place confidence in us, &s;hall endeavour to ruin us. I hardly imagine that this can require a &s;erious an&s;wer. The contrary propo&s;ition is &s;elf-evident. Had we at every court in Europe, per&s;ons &s;o warmly intere&s;ted in our favour as tho&s;e &s;tockholders mu&s;t be, we &s;hould have warm &s;upporters in ca&s;e any of tho&s;e courts &s;hould form ho&s;tile de|&s;igns again&s;t us. Nothing can make &s;uch &s;tockholders our enemies, but breaking our contracts with them.</P>
<P>The report adds, "at be&s;t, if it were even confined to the hands of Americans, it would be totally de&s;tructive of
<PB N="57" REF="019884_0060_0FAD417F4B525890">
that equality which ought to prevail in a republic." What equality is here meant? Why did not the committee explain it? Holding more or le&s;s &s;hares in the bank cannot de&s;troy it, unle&s;s they meant equality in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property. If that was their view, they &s;hould fir&s;t have reported a law, fixing limits to indu&s;try&mdash;and an agrarian law for making an equal divi&s;ion of property. But I believe tho&s;e mea&s;ures would prove as di&s;agreeable to the members of that commit|tee, as to the &s;tockholders of the bank. Each of them, I imagine, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more now than would fall to his &s;hare on &s;uch a divi&s;ion; and there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, they would be fond of parting with what they hold: for, on the contrary, they are like their neighbours, trying to get more. I may be told, that this is my ca&s;e&mdash;Agreed&mdash;I have &s;ome property; repeated attempts have been made to deprive me of it&mdash;I have not only re&s;i&s;ted &s;uch attempts &s;ucce&s;sfully, but continue to exert my&s;elf in the acqui&s;ition of more. Make a divi&s;ion, and that indu&s;try cea&s;es.</P>
<P>"We have nothing," the report continues, "in our free and equal government, capable of balancing the influence which the bank mu&s;t create."</P>
<P>On this point, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to mention the late at|tempt&mdash;not to balance&mdash;but totally to de&s;troy the bank. I &s;hall therefore make no other appeal, than to the report it|&s;elf, for the refutation of this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The report proceeds, "We &s;ee nothing, which, in the cour&s;e of a few years, can prevent the directors of the bank from governing Penn&s;ylvania."</P>
<P>Therefore there is nothing, for if there had been, &s;o wi&s;e a committee mu&s;t have &s;een it. But did they &s;ee any thing that was likely to place the government in their hands? I may &s;afely an&s;wer no, for if they had, they would not have failed in that part of their duty&mdash;they would have mention|ed it in the &s;tronge&s;t terms.</P>
<P>Again the report proceeds, "Already the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;em|bly, the repre&s;entatives of the people, have been threatened that the credit of our paper currency will be bla&s;ted by the bank."</P>
<P>I a&s;k, who made tho&s;e threats? Is it in proof that the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank have made them? If they have been &s;o imprudent, let it be &s;hewn, and I agree that they abide the con&s;equences: if &s;uch threats have been made by other per&s;ons, advocates of the bank, can their conduct be urged as a &s;erious charge again&s;t the in&s;titution?
<PB N="58" REF="019884_0061_0FAD418011CC1F30">
But even &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch threats to have been made, let us &s;ee what has actually been done: The only oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ure of emitting paper money, was made during the time that mea&s;ure was in agitation: and &s;urely that was the proper time for tho&s;e who di&s;approved it, to make their op|po&s;ition. They did not continue to oppo&s;e after the mea|&s;ure was adopted: at lea&s;t the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank did not. It was not expected of them that they &s;hould give hard money in exchange for the paper emi&s;&s;ion: they could not, without being guilty of a breach of tru&s;t: but upon the reque&s;t of &s;ome friends to the paper money, they agreed to receive it on depo&s;it, and to an&s;wer the drafts of the depo&s;itors, drawn at their own will and plea&s;ure; this was done at &s;ome expence, much trouble, and at lea&s;t &s;o far gave countenance and credit, as to induce many to receive it in payment. In fact, they gave the paper every countenance they con&s;i&s;tently could, and probably more than they ought to have done.</P>
<P>"If," concludes the report, "this growing evil conti|nues, we fear the time is not very di&s;tant when the bank will be able to dictate to the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, what laws to pa&s;s and what to forbear." I hope the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania will always be compo&s;ed of men independent in &s;pirit&mdash;independent in fortune: whil&s;t this is the ca&s;e, there is nothing to fear from this bug-a-boo; &s;uch men would &s;purn at all attempts to dictate to the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>But I have already &s;hewn, that no &s;uch danger as is here held out, can po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the bank. So long as the electors of the &s;tate take care to return for their repre&s;enta|tives, men of &s;en&s;e, integrity, &s;pirit, and property, the peo|ple will derive &s;ecurity to their lives, liberties, and property. And although it was, &s;ome time &s;ince, fa&s;hionable with &s;ome people to cry out, that men of property &s;hould be ex|cluded from any &s;hare in the government, yet it will be found, that the public &s;afety con&s;i&s;ts be&s;t with placing the government in the hands of tho&s;e who contribute to bear its burdens.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the report; and have, I think, proved that it is not founded in truth, &s;upported by facts, nor warranted by any information given to, or obtained by, the committee who made it. In&s;tead of adducing facts, they have &s;tated opinions: and what has been done in con&s;e|quence? The then hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, in con&s;equence of that report, pa&s;&s;ed an act for taking away the charter of the
<PB N="59" REF="019884_0062_0FAD41810F882688">
bank. The preamble to that act, &s;tates, "That the bank has been found injurious to the &s;tate."</P>
<P>It is then no longer a matter of opinion&mdash;as &s;tated in the report: but is in the preamble a&s;&s;erted as a matter of fact. I maintain that the a&s;&s;ertion is untrue. De&s;irous to treat the former hou&s;e with as much decency as the occa&s;ion will permit, I refrain from u&s;ing other epithets, which might with propriety be applied; but the round a&s;&s;ertion in the preamble to the act, demands as &s;trong a reply: there was no proof to &s;upport that a&s;&s;ertion: the committee did not even pretend to any. The hou&s;e was deceived by the tenor and plau&s;ibility of the report: and that committee are cul|pable.</P>
<P>Will this hou&s;e, then, &s;uffer to remain enrolled among&s;t the laws of Penn&s;ylvania, an act, pa&s;&s;ed under deception, and founded on mere a&s;&s;ertion of matter, neither proved or &s;upported? I hope they will not. I hope this hou&s;e has too great a regard for the honour of the &s;tate, to permit that law to remain unrepealed.</P>
<P>Ordered, that the further con&s;ideration of the report be po&s;tponed.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, March</HI> 31, 1786, A. M.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>RESUMED the con&s;ideration of the report of the committee, to whom were referred the memorials pray|ing a repeal or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the law annulling the charter of the bank.</P>
<P>Mr. Whitehill. A great deal has been &s;aid on the &s;ubject now under con&s;ideration of this hou&s;e. I &s;till remain of my former opinion (for I have heard no rea&s;on adduced to con|vince me of the contrary) that the charter and in&s;titution of the bank were totally incompatible with the intere&s;t and wel|fare of Penn&s;ylvania. In that opinion I &s;hall remain, until I hear better rea&s;ons offered on the other &s;ide of the que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>The report before the hou&s;e, conveys a number of invi|dious reflections on the late a&s;&s;embly, and on their commit|tee who made the report relative to the bank. In taking a review of it, I think it will appear tho&s;e reflections are ill-founded, and unwarranted by fact.</P>
<P>It &s;tates, <Q>that the report made to the late hou&s;e, was grounded in general notions preconceived, or on the cur|rent
<PB N="60" REF="019884_0063_0FAD4182311012E8">
popular opinions and &s;peculations, without much con&s;ideration being be&s;towed on the &s;pecial &s;ubject; and the &s;ame may at lea&s;t be &s;aid of the petitions pre&s;ented again&s;t the bank:</Q></P>
<P>And <Q>that the hou&s;e did not derive from either mem|bers of that committee, or the &s;aid petitioners, tho&s;e clear lights, which would have been nece&s;&s;ary to their de|liberations, on &s;o difficult and intere&s;ting a &s;ubject, and which, from the in&s;tructions to their committee, they &s;eem to have de&s;ired.</Q></P>
<P>What is to be &s;uppo&s;ed the enquiry nece&s;&s;ary to be made in this ca&s;e? or what the lights nece&s;&s;ary to the deliberations of the hou&s;e? Are not tho&s;e popular opinions, the opinions of the people of the &s;tate? And can the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, the repre&s;entatives of the people at large, have a &s;urer guide to regulate their conduct, than the opinions of their con|&s;tituents?</P>
<P>The charge of not affording the pre&s;ident and directors a hearing, is ill founded. Becau&s;e they were not heard until the third reading of the bill, does it therefore nece&s;&s;arily fol|low, that they were not heard at all?</P>
<P>The late hou&s;e is charged with having come to a ha&s;ty de|termination, and broken through the procra&s;tinating forms of proceeding, which were fixed as fences, again&s;t the &s;ud|den violences of power. This is a wrong &s;tatement, and a very unju&s;t in&s;inuation. The repealing act was pa&s;&s;ed with every u&s;ual formality.</P>
<P>Not having made any enquiry at the bank, is &s;tated as ve|ry criminal in the committee&mdash;But that would have been a very improper place to make any enquiry. Would the pre|&s;ident and directors have told us of the partiality or favour|iti&s;m they might have been guilty of? Would they have told us of any failure in their duty? They would have giv|en us no &s;uch information. Would they have told us that the bank was incompatible with the &s;afety or welfare of the &s;tate? No &s;uch thing. A gentleman from the city [mr. R. Morris] has &s;aid that if we had applied to him, he would have given us information&mdash;But we might as well apply at the bank as to him&mdash;he is deeply intere&s;ted in the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The committee enquired into the nature of the bank&mdash;and its compatibility with the public welfare&mdash;and found no &s;uch compatibility. It has been a&s;ked, how is the bank dan|gerous&mdash;how incompatible with the public welfare? I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew how. It advances paper on the credit of
<PB N="61" REF="019884_0064_0FAD4182B30E01E0">
the money in its vaults, and its loans are confined to 45 days&mdash;a period which can never afford any opportunity for the country people to profit by it: as it is impo&s;&s;ible they can come down here every 45 days to renew their obligations. It moreover cramps the credit and circulation of the paper money of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I am again&s;t the report as propo&s;ing to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the bank on its former charter. [Here mr. Whitehill read that clau&s;e of the charter, which empowered the corporation to have a &s;tock not exceeding ten millions of dollars&mdash;and that which appointed the pre&s;ident and directors: he then ad|ded:] This &s;tock of ten millions of dollars was too great an e&s;tate&mdash;it afforded too great a liberty to the bank. The pre|&s;ident and directors were incorporated without the hou&s;e knowing any of their bye laws and regulations. The &s;ame per&s;ons might be pre&s;ident and directors all their lives. There would have been no end of the corporation, but by a repeal of their charter, let them exerci&s;e their powers how they would.</P>
<P>The late hou&s;e has been charged with a ha&s;ty determina|tion in repealing the charter: But the hou&s;e that granted it, was much more ha&s;ty in its proceedings: as I &s;hall &s;hew. On the 22d of February, 1782, a letter was pre&s;ented from the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank, praying leave to bring in a bill to incorporate the &s;ub&s;cribers thereto. The 25th of the &s;ame month, the bill was brought in, and read a fir&s;t time: no committee had been appointed to prepare it. The 26th, it was on motion read a &s;econd time, and ordered to be tran&s;cribed and printed for public con&s;ideration. Thus it appears there was not a &s;ingle day between the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond reading. The 25th of March, it was read a third time, and ordered to be engro&s;&s;ed. The fir&s;t of April it was enacted into a law. All this was in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion. In this mode was the charter obtained. Time for con&s;ideration was not allowed to the public, the bill was gone through with &s;uch precipitancy. Yet the late hou&s;e is charged with hav|ing broke through the procra&s;tinating forms, although the repealing act lay over from the winter &s;e&s;&s;ions to the fall, a period of four or five months. At the fall &s;e&s;&s;ions, coun&s;el was heard for and again&s;t it. The committee could not be charged with having deceived the hou&s;e: for after they had made the report, the matter was fairly argued, as well by the members, as by the coun&s;el.&mdash;After all this delibera|tion&mdash;all the&s;e lights thrown upon the &s;ubject&mdash;it may be
<PB N="62" REF="019884_0065_0FAD418562786AC8">
&s;afely &s;aid, that no bu&s;ine&s;s ever was more fairly argued&mdash;Why, then, are we charged with ha&s;ty mea&s;ures?</P>
<P>The bank does not help the farmer&mdash;nor promote the agriculture of the &s;tate. If the farmer, who is the &s;trength of the country, be cut off from procuring &s;upplies of money, to enable him to improve his lands, the &s;tate mu&s;t langui&s;h. A loan office is the only &s;ure means of encouraging agricul|ture, and enabling the farmer to bring his produce to mar|ket. This cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed by hard money, for that is in the vaults of the bank: and while the &s;tockholders can derive 16 per cent from their money, no hopes remain of bor|rowing at legal intere&s;t. The laws have guarded again&s;t ex|tortion&mdash;but the&s;e laws are evaded by the bank. Shall we &s;upport this engine of de&s;truction, and enable a few men to take advantage of their wealth, and to &s;top di&s;counts when|ever they plea&s;e, in times of the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>The que&s;tion at pre&s;ent is, whether the &s;tate &s;hall give way to the bank, or the bank give way to the &s;tate? For the bank is &s;et up as a party in the &s;tate&mdash;It has created great di&s;turbance. How often has it been before the hou&s;e of a&s;|&s;embly, taking up the public time, and occa&s;ioning a wa&s;te of the public money? In 1782&mdash;in 1784&mdash;in 1785&mdash;at our la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions, and now again. What is the de&s;ign in all this? Is it the good of the &s;tate? Can we believe, if the bank had a tendency to promote the intere&s;t of the people, that the &s;tate would oppo&s;e it? If the gentlemen can &s;hew that it has &s;uch a tendency, I &s;hall be happy to join in &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urpri&s;ed the gentlemen are &s;o &s;olicitous to pro|cure another charter for the bank. While it has no char|ter, their private circum&s;tances are liable to account for any deficiencies: and how do we know whether they can &s;ettle their accounts, and have money enough to pay off their notes? Cannot it go on as a private bank? How many banks in Europe are carried on in that manner? I hope we will not give a monopoly of banking to tho&s;e gentlemen. It has been denied to be a monopoly.&mdash;But when other per|&s;ons wi&s;hed to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;econd bank, the pre&s;ident and di|rectors of the pre&s;ent bank had &s;ufficient influence to pre|vent them from getting a charter. Indeed one of the gen|tlemen from the city acknowledged that it had been a mono|poly during the war.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. I beg leave to explain. I did not &s;ay that the bank was a monopoly during the war. I only &s;aid that
<PB N="63" REF="019884_0066_0FAD41868BE9F8F8">
if the charge of monopoly ever had any appearance of foun|dation, it was during that period.</P>
<P>Mr. Whitehill. I believe it will not be denied to be a mo|nopoly, if it has &s;ufficient influence to make head again&s;t all attempts at e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;imilar in&s;titution. The gentleman has &s;aid, that if we do not repeal the law taking away the charter of the bank, an appeal will be made to the courts of ju&s;tice. I &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed that this mode had been tried fir&s;t, and that the matter had not been bro't before this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>One part of the report &s;tates, that the memoriali&s;ts may be con&s;trued to &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania. How many are there of them? Two thou&s;and nine hundred and forty &s;even&mdash;of whom 670 are from Lanca&s;ter county: although we may &s;afely &s;ay, it is probable that not 60 are acquainted with the nature of banks, and the various matters contained in tho&s;e memorials, and the charges they convey again&s;t the late hou&s;e and committee. There were one thou&s;and petiti|oners from Lanca&s;ter again&s;t the erection of the &s;hambles in High-&s;treet. This, therefore, as has been already &s;tated, only proves the activity of the per&s;ons intere&s;ted in the bank, in procuring &s;igners to the memorials. With the &s;ame acti|vity, I have no doubt, twenty or thirty thou&s;and petitioners might be procured to expunge the bank. Therefore it is wrong to &s;ay they &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of the community.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident and directors of the bank, have not only a &s;eparate intere&s;t from the &s;tate&mdash;but al&s;o an oppo&s;ite intere&s;t. Their advantage lies in depreciating the paper money of the &s;tate&mdash;for the more of that is &s;uppored, the le&s;s of theirs they can i&s;&s;ue. Upon every con&s;ideration, therefore, the bank is incompatible with the welfare of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>One gentleman has &s;aid that the &s;tate has done violence to the bank&mdash;and that it has &s;uffered more than the hou&s;e can remedy, even by re&s;toring the charter. The hou&s;e did not take away any of their property&mdash;the charter was not their property. It was a piece of &s;ealed writing, which the hou&s;e might burn when they plea&s;ed. Their property is as &s;afe as it was.</P>
<P>The late hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly did not take away the charter of the bank for any crime&mdash;nor did they charge the pre&s;i|dent and directors with having forfeited it. They took up the con&s;ideration of the matter upon general principles&mdash;they found it would be impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;tate paper money while the charter remained. Why then &s;hould they de&s;troy
<PB N="64" REF="019884_0067_0FAD4186CE2BBB38">
the credit of that, which was the only effectual mode that had been di&s;covered for relieving the &s;uffering creditors? But a gentleman lately propo&s;ed to have all the paper money called in, in order to make way for the bank.</P>
<P>If charters cannot be repealed, becau&s;e they are contracts, it affords a great invitation to fraud. A gentleman in enu|merating the powers of the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly from the con|&s;titution, did not read the whole &s;entence&mdash;at the conclu&s;ion of which it is &s;tated that they &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s all the other ne|ce&s;&s;ary powers of a legi&s;lature. Charters of public corpora|tions, when not found agreeable to the welfare of the peo|ple, may be taken away by the legi&s;lature. Two in&s;tances of the &s;ort have occurred in this &s;tate. One was the charter of the college of Penn&s;ylvania, and the other the charter of the proprietaries.</P>
<P>Mr. Finlay. This que&s;tion, which has &s;o long engaged the attention of the hou&s;e, and on the merits of which, gentle|men eminent for di&s;cernment, have exerci&s;ed &s;o much abi|lity, is of &s;uch importance in it&s;elf, and involves in it &s;uch exten&s;ive con&s;equences, as to ju&s;tify my reque&s;ting the atten|tion of the hou&s;e to a few ob&s;ervations which I propo&s;e to offer re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid re&s;pecting the extraordinary rea&s;oning in the preamble of the report under debate, which bears evi|dent marks of the manner in which di&s;appointed avarice chagrins an intere&s;ted mind. I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that though the rea&s;oning in the report of the committee of the late hou&s;e, recommending the pa&s;&s;ing a law to repeal the charter of the bank, were in&s;ufficient or mi&s;taken, yet if &s;ufficient rea&s;ons do now exi&s;t in the nature of the ca&s;e, to &s;upport the princi|ples thereof, it ought not to be repealed. This propo&s;ition is &s;upported by legi&s;lative and judicial examples. In appeals from the lower to the higher courts, the que&s;tion is not&mdash;<Q>what were the rea&s;ons the lower courts a&s;&s;igned for their deci&s;ion?</Q> but "whether was the deci&s;ion ju&s;t or not?"&mdash;Many examples might be produced, of reports of commit|tees, and preambles of laws, not expre&s;&s;ing the true and pro|per rea&s;ons of the re&s;pective re&s;olutions or laws. To try all laws by the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned in their preambles, would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k. Therefore, not to dwell on this, I &s;hall endea|vour to prove, that the legi&s;lature had a power to repeal the charter of the bank; and that &s;ufficient rea&s;ons did exi&s;t, to ju&s;tify the expediency of their doing it.</P>
<P>All governments being in&s;tituted for the good of the &s;oci|ety
<PB N="65" REF="019884_0068_0FAD4187891CB7C8">
to which they belong, the &s;upreme legi&s;lative power of every community nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power of repealing every law inimical to the public &s;afety. But the government of Penn&s;ylvania being a democracy, the bank is incon&s;i&s;tent with the bill of rights thereof, which &s;ays, that government is not in&s;tituted for the emolument of any man, family, or &s;et of men. Therefore, this in&s;titution being a monopoly, and having a natural tendency, by affording the means, to promote the &s;pirit of monopolizing, is incon&s;i&s;tent with not only the frame but the &s;pirit of our government. If the le|gi&s;lature may mortgage, or, in other words, charter away portions of either the privileges or powers of the &s;tate&mdash;if they may incorporate bodies for the &s;ole purpo&s;es of gain, with the power of making bye-laws, and of enjoying an e|molument of privilege, profit, influence, or power,&mdash;and cannot di&s;annul their own deed, and re&s;tore to the citizens their right of equal protection, power, privilege, and in|fluence,&mdash;the con&s;equence is, that &s;ome fooli&s;h and wanton a&s;&s;embly may parcel out the commonwealth into little ari&s;|tocracies, and &s;o overturn the nature of our government without remedy.</P>
<P>This in&s;titution is incon&s;i&s;tent with our laws&mdash;our habits&mdash;our manners.&mdash;Our laws and habits countenance long credits, and afford &s;low methods for recovering debts. They &s;ubject our real e&s;tates to alienation, and to be &s;old for debts. They divide our e&s;tates, both real and per&s;onal, more equally among our heirs, than the laws or habits of any other coun|try I know of. We are too unequal in wealth to render a perfect democracy &s;uitable to our circum&s;tances: yet we are &s;o equal in wealth, power, &amp;c. that we have no counterpoi&s;e &s;ufficient to check or control an in&s;titution of &s;uch va&s;t in|fluence and magnitude. We have no kingly prerogative&mdash;no wealthy companies of merchants incorporated&mdash;no here|ditary nobles, with va&s;tly great e&s;tates and numerous depen|dents&mdash;no feudal laws to &s;upport family dignity, by keeping landed e&s;tates undivided. What &s;ecurity, then, can we pur|po&s;e to our&s;elves again&s;t the eventual influence of &s;uch wealth, conducted under the direction of &s;uch a boundle&s;s charter?</P>
<P>This charter was for a perpetuity&mdash;not &s;ubject to change&mdash;In this it was contrary to our con&s;titution, which is liable to change every &s;even years.</P>
<P>But let us take a more di&s;tinct view of the nature of this in&s;titution, and of human nature it&s;elf. Enormous wealth,
<PB N="66" REF="019884_0069_0FAD418856F7D648">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by individuals, has always had its influence and dan|ger in free &s;tates. Thus, even in Rome, where patrioti&s;m &s;eems to have pervaded every mind, and all her mea&s;ures to have been conducted with republican vigour, yet even there, the patricians always had their clients&mdash;their dependents&mdash;by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of whom they often convul&s;ed the coun|&s;els, and di&s;tracted the operations of the &s;tate, and finally overturned the government it&s;elf. But the Romans had no chartered in&s;titutions for the &s;ole purpo&s;es of gain. They chartered no banks.</P>
<P>Wealth in many hands operates as many checks: for in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, one wealthy man has a control over another. Every man in the di&s;po&s;al of his own wealth, will act upon his own principles. His virtue, his honour, his &s;ym|pathy, and genero&s;ity, will influence his di&s;po&s;als and de|&s;igns; and he is in a &s;tate of per&s;onal re&s;pon&s;ibility. But when &s;uch an unlimited in&s;titution is erected with &s;uch a capital, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of increa&s;ing wealth, it mu&s;t operate according to its principle; and being in the hands of many, having only one point in view, and being put in tru&s;t, the per&s;onal re&s;pon&s;ibility ari&s;ing from the principles of honour, genero&s;ity, &amp;c. can have no place. The &s;pecial temper of the in&s;titution pervades all its operations: and thus, like a &s;now ball perpetually rolled, it mu&s;t continual|ly increa&s;e its dimen&s;ions and influence.</P>
<P>This in&s;titution having no principle but that of avarice, which dries and &s;hrivels up all the manly&mdash;all the generous feelings of the human &s;oul, will never be varied in its object: and, if continued, will accompli&s;h its end, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to engro&s;s all the wealth, power, and influence of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The human &s;oul is affected by wealth, in almo&s;t all its fa|culties. It is affected by its pre&s;ent intere&s;t, by its expecta|tions, and by its fears. And mu&s;t not, therefore, every thinking man &s;ee what advantage this in&s;titution has on the human feelings, above that of wealth held by many indivi|duals? If our wealth is le&s;s equal than our kind of govern|ment &s;eems to require&mdash;and if agrarian laws are unju&s;t in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, how ab&s;urd mu&s;t it be for government to lend its &s;pecial aid in &s;o partial a manner, to wealth, to give it that additional force and &s;pring, which it mu&s;t de|rive from an almo&s;t unlimited charter? Can any gentleman avoid &s;eeing this to be eventually and effectually overturn|ing our government? Democracy mu&s;t fall before it. Wealth is its foundation, and gain its object and de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="019884_0070_0FAD418909162818">
Thus it appears that this in&s;titution is incon&s;i&s;tent with our general laws, cu&s;toms, and circum&s;tances, and even with the nature of our government. The proofs are not found|ed on facts of doubtful credibility. They are drawn from the nature of things: and the principles of nature being ju&s;tly &s;tated, this kind of arguments are conclu&s;ive. They carry their evidence with them, with a certainty like that of the &s;parks flying upwards, or the waters running to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame principles, it is evident that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our commerce, the bank facilitates both public and private ruin. The balance of trade being con&s;tantly again&s;t us, commerce with us has contracted a different meaning from what it has in Europe. There it is founded on the produce and manufactures of the re&s;pective countries, for which the merchant finds a foreign market, and in lieu of which he brings a &s;uitable return. From the exce&s;s of the exports, the nation is enriched. With us it may, with more propriety, be &s;tyled importation than commerce: and this importation, carried on to too great a degree before the re|volution, is greatly facilitated by the bank.</P>
<P>A worthy gentleman from the city [mr. Morris] has de|clared it as his opinion, that precedents from Ireland are im|proper, as that country does not boa&s;t of its commerce or wealth, and is under Engli&s;h trammels. He &s;ays it is a good country to import people, linen, and potatoes from&mdash;but not commercial precedents. I do not pretend to much commer|mercial knowledge. I have indeed &s;ome general knowledge; and am of opinion, if we had &s;uch linen and cambric ma|nufactures as the Iri&s;h&mdash;if we exported &s;o much beef, but|ter, and pork&mdash;and manufactured &s;o much woollens as they do&mdash;we &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the immediate means of com|merce. But, being under Briti&s;h trammels, her people, who ought to be employed at home, are obliged to emigrate in abundance. If they are e&s;teemed an article of commerce, that branch of her trade has been much to our advantage.</P>
<P>But as for us, though we have the foundations of com|merce, we have not, nor can we &s;oon have the means of car|rying it on exten&s;ively to advantage. We export flour, which, through the &s;carcity of labourers, has failed in the quantity. We export flax&s;eed, which, through the oldne&s;s of the lands contiguous to market, and the change of &s;ea&s;ons, has al&s;o failed greatly, &s;o as to be &s;carcely worth mentioning. We export lumber, which has failed in like manner, and mu&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="019884_0071_0FAD4189EEE825F0">
continue to fail, in proportion as our woodland is cleared. Is this a balance for our amazing importations, not only from Europe but both the Indies? From tho&s;e va&s;t import|ations, the number of our dealing people was increa&s;ed. The bank gave the means of purcha&s;ing foreign cargoes&mdash;the acce&s;s was ea&s;y&mdash;but the credit &s;hort.&mdash;The ha&s;ty day of payment approached&mdash;hence the numerous tribe of brokers aro&s;e. The involved debtor went from friend to friend for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of credit&mdash;from broker to broker for co&s;tly &s;upplies of ca&s;h&mdash;until ruin overwhelmed him with confu&s;ion and woe: and he who was, or appeared to be, a capital deal|er, fell. Like a mighty oak in the woods, he cru&s;hed many by his fall. Thus of late, the cry of private ruin in this ci|ty, has not only been heard by our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates&mdash;but by fo|reign nations. Thus hath the &s;tate been drained of what mo|ney was circulating within it, and the means of &s;upporting the revenues and credit thereof been taken away: no doubt there has been a concurrence of other cau&s;es. The impru|dence of the unfortunate is often a&s;&s;igned as one cau&s;e: and no doubt it was: but experience forbids to &s;et down the un|fortunate always as fools or knaves. Many who had fair and hone&s;t pro&s;pects, or who a&s;&s;i&s;ted with their credit tho&s;e who had, finding every u&s;ual means of extricating them&s;elves cut off by the inundation of foreign goods, have, whil&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of hone&s;t principles and competent &s;agacity, &s;unk in the common ruin.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid of the merits of the bank in prevent|ing the money from leaving the country. I know the export|ation of money is contrary to its intere&s;t. But the little arts of the directors, to detain it in the country, are contempti|ble as an argument, and ineffectual as a means. What are the methods by which they retain it? A gentleman [mr. Morris] has told us, that when a ve&s;&s;el is up for England, the directors know tho&s;e who apply for di&s;counts, in order to &s;end the money away, as readily as a cat knows a mou&s;e, and that they refu&s;e them.&mdash;Are the&s;e the mighty means? Is this the boa&s;ted &s;ecurity?</P>
<P>I have already proved that the bank facilitates importa|tion: con&s;equently it facilitates contracting debts abroad: and if the debts are facilitated, why clog the payment? Bet|ter that the remittances could be made in an air balloon, and the freight &s;aved. In Spain where they have the precious metals poured in from their &s;ettlements, and are manufactur|ers of money&mdash;in order to prevent its being exported, ten
<PB N="69" REF="019884_0072_0FAD418D26CAA618">
per cent. (if I am not mi&s;taken) is charged on the remittances to England: and a higher duty is charged on the remittances from the Havannah and New Orleans. Yet can any man of under&s;tanding &s;ay that the Spani&s;h dominions are enriched by this? By no means. They are &s;carcer of money, in pro|portion to their u&s;es, than we are.</P>
<P>The way for individuals or nations to get rich, is not to have artificial difficulties laid in the way of paying their debts; but to contract few of them. The debts mu&s;t be paid: and the bank collects the money to a point, where it can be ea|&s;ier found in large &s;ums for exportation, than in any other manner: and tho&s;e little &s;hifts, which depend on per&s;onal &s;agacity or integrity, are fit only for a plau&s;ible colouring for refu&s;ing to &s;upply tho&s;e who are not favourites; and the more effectually di&s;cover how well it is calculated to pro|mote the monopolizing of trade. What &s;ecurity have we that its a&s;&s;i&s;tance will not be partially exerted for this purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>This in&s;titution is it&s;elf a monopoly&mdash;being incorporated a great trading company&mdash;and having a right to turn ten mil|lions of dollars into trade, if the pre&s;ident and directors plea&s;e&mdash;or to lay out that amount upon land. So, by taking advantage of a &s;carcity of money, which they have it &s;o much in their power to occa&s;ion, they may become &s;ole lords of the &s;oil. If they may monopolize trade&mdash;if they may mo|nopolize the &s;oil&mdash;why not the government too? Doubtle&s;s they may.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay whether or no the bank is a monopoly in the &s;trict legal &s;en&s;e of the word. This is not to my purpo&s;e. But I &s;ay that it is, in its nature and principles, in the com|mon popular &s;en&s;e, a monopoly: and being &s;o in its nature, it mu&s;t be &s;o in its effects. This is a certain conclu&s;ion. I do not charge the directors or &s;tock-holders per&s;onally with &s;uch de&s;igns: but this being the nature of the in&s;titution, it becomes the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of the directors to conduct it according to its natural principles.</P>
<P>Great wealth &s;eems, even with individuals, to have a ten|dency to monopolizing. It was the &s;aying of a wi&s;e writer, when riches increa&s;e, they are increa&s;ed that have them&mdash;increa&s;ed in their appetite for riches, and in their endea|vours to procure them.</P>
<P>This in&s;titution I believe to be inimical to the emi&s;&s;ion and credit of paper money. Let us for a moment compare the &s;tate paper with that of the bank, with re&s;pect to their &s;er|vice
<PB N="70" REF="019884_0073_0FAD418DBAD2B740">
to this country. For this purpo&s;e, I beg leave to advert a little to the hi&s;tory of paper money. Its amazing u&s;eful|ne&s;s to Penn&s;ylvania, before the revolution, is well known. But when the nece&s;&s;ities of congre&s;s obliged tham to emit paper money, they were obliged to emit it in great quantities, and had not the power or means of appropriating &s;ufficient funds for its redemption. And to look back, I rather won|der that tho&s;e emi&s;&s;ions &s;erved us &s;o well, than otherwi&s;e. Though the mea&s;ure was then unavoidable, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve there is not &s;ufficient &s;afety in one public body judging of the quantity of money to be emitted&mdash;and another, or rather many other public bodies having to judge of and appropriate the means of redeeming it. But there is more &s;afety in one body being obliged to judge of the quantity&mdash;the u&s;es&mdash;the funds&mdash;and the manner of redemption.</P>
<P>When this &s;tate emitted the i&s;land &s;tate money, as it was called, the funds were &s;ufficient, but not immediately pro|ductive; and there was abundance of paper money in circu|lation. Yet it &s;tood its ground tolerably, until the va&s;t &s;um of 500,000l. was emitted upon funds uncertain in their ope|ration, and not productive then, nor in a &s;ufficient degree yet. This &s;unk the credit of the other with it; and became a valuable &s;peculation&mdash;perhaps to &s;ome of the planners of the emi&s;&s;ion. The other re&s;umed its credit in&s;tantly, when the funds became productive. But having &s;poken largely on this &s;ubject in the la&s;t hou&s;e, I &s;hall &s;ay no further now&mdash;but ob&s;erve that the la&s;t emi&s;&s;ion has funds much more than &s;ufficient. The&s;e funds are con&s;tantly productive: and the u&s;es which keep it in circulation, are abundant. Therefore it cannot fail of holding its credit&mdash;and has &s;tood its ground again&s;t a very powerful oppo&s;ition indeed. Though I do not &s;ay that any direct attack was made upon it by the di|rectors of the bank&mdash;as I do not blame them for not receiving it&mdash;yet it was evidently oppo&s;ed through the influence of that in&s;titution. In the eighth general a&s;&s;embly, the direc|tors wrote to the hou&s;e, di&s;&s;uading them from the emi&s;&s;ion they were about to make, giving their opinion that it would not do, and offering a loan. The prophecying its fate, by tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have the power to bla&s;t it, had the de&s;ired effect; and the emi&s;&s;ion was dropped. When the funding bill was going through the late hou&s;e, could tho&s;e who were intere&s;ted in, or dependent on, the bank, do more than they did, to prevent the emi&s;&s;ion, and to di&s;courage the people, already rendered &s;u&s;picious by former events?
<PB N="71" REF="019884_0074_0FAD418E6ECF9CB0">
Did not the friends of the bank, in that hou&s;e, predict that it would be three or four for one, as &s;oon as emitted? Did not the gentlemen of this hou&s;e who are intere&s;ted in the bank, endeavour at our la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, to have it all called in? Have they not afterwards complained of its not purcha&s;ing the nece&s;&s;aries of life? Did not one gentleman tell us it was from two and a half to five per cent. below par? I mu&s;t an&s;wer, that in&s;tances of the kind have not &s;truck my ob|&s;ervation. I very lately changed a con&s;iderable &s;um, and have &s;een others do the &s;ame, without a&s;king or being of|fered any advance. There can be none who would a&s;k or give any advance, but &s;uch as are intere&s;ted in, or indebted to, the bank. At lea&s;t, in all my dealings in the city, none have he&s;itated to take it, but tho&s;e who told me they mu&s;t have money for the bank. Con&s;idering the&s;e things, there is nothing wonderful in &s;ome in&s;tances of &s;uch an advance being given. It is but the price of convenience. I have fre|quently &s;een three pence given in Ireland for getting &s;ilver for a guinea: but the people there never thought the gold of le&s;s value on that account. Many &s;uch in&s;tances might be produced.</P>
<P>A gentleman from the city [mr. Morris] has mentioned the quick circulation of the paper as an argument again&s;t its credit. He &s;ays it returns to the trea&s;ury almo&s;t as fa&s;t as i&s;&s;ued. I congratulate the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania upon the news, as a &s;atisfactory evidence of returning confidence. It brightens our pro&s;pects of pro&s;perous days. The public creditor has been relieved by it. The moneyle&s;s farmer has with it paid his taxes, which had accumulated for years pa&s;t. It has brought into circulation the little hard money that remained. Our trea&s;ury is kept bu&s;y receiving it, and as bu&s;y paying it away. Who refu&s;es the paper money from us? None&mdash;for the comptroller general is kept employed almo&s;t night and day&mdash;people hurry him &s;o that they may get it. Certainly the gentleman could not mean this as an argument again&s;t paper money.</P>
<P>Much might be &s;aid on the advantages of the loan office. But the principles of this in&s;titution are &s;o well under&s;tood, that I &s;hould e&s;teem it an in&s;ult to the good &s;en&s;e of the hou&s;e to enter on them.</P>
<P>Thus far I have mo&s;tly confined my&s;elf to principles, and the rea&s;on and nature of things: arguments of this kind being ju&s;tly laid, I take to be mo&s;t convincing: for every man knows things will operate according to their nature.
<PB N="72" REF="019884_0075_0FAD41912923A978">
But I beg leave now to animadvert on certain arguments made u&s;e of by &s;ome of the rea&s;oners on the other &s;ide: for hitherto I have only touched on a few of them, in order to illu&s;trate my &s;ubject. I would fir&s;t ob&s;erve that I took no notes at the time of the debate&mdash;as I did not then de&s;ign to enter &s;o largely on the &s;ubject. I &s;hall therefore remark on but few of the gentlemen's arguments.</P>
<P>A worthy gentleman from the city [mr. Fitz&s;imons] in|forms us, that he is a &s;tockholder in, and director of, the bank; and that there are &s;everal &s;tockholders members of this hou&s;e.&mdash;He ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that this does not debar them from the con&s;titutional right of canva&s;&s;ing for offices at elections&mdash;and advocating their own cau&s;e on the floor of this hou&s;e. Doubtle&s;s the gentleman is right. For though the con&s;titution excludes executive officers from &s;eats in the legi&s;lature, le&s;t they &s;hould influence it to make their &s;ala|ries more lucrative, or their duties more ea&s;y: yet the con|vention neglected to guard again&s;t men, who have procured peculiar privileges by obtaining partial laws in their own favour, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of gain, advocating their own cau&s;e by the advantage of a &s;eat in this hou&s;e. This re|minds me of the famous laws of Solon, which, though an excellent &s;y&s;tem, neglected to provide any puni&s;hment for a per&s;on who &s;hould murder his father or mother&mdash;doubtle&s;s not expecting &s;uch a crime would ever be committed. And indeed I think the convention guarded &s;o well again&s;t the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate granting any kind of monopolies, or partial prerogatives, as cut off the probability of any &s;uch thing happening in this &s;tate: yet &s;uch is the cour&s;e of af|fairs, that advantage has been taken of the embarra&s;&s;ments and inexperience of the &s;tate, and this very thing has hap|pened.</P>
<P>As to canva&s;&s;ing at elections, I apprehend it is not com|mon nor honourable to canva&s;s for a &s;eat in the legi&s;lature, where the candidate has only in view to &s;erve the public. But where he has a cau&s;e of his own to advocate, intere&s;t will dictate the propriety of canva&s;&s;ing for a &s;eat. Indeed the emolument ari&s;ing from it, would induce but few wi&s;e men to canva&s;s for a &s;eat in this hou&s;e purely to &s;erve the public: for few who know the importance of the &s;ervice, will think them&s;elves fit for it. We al&s;o allow to the gen|tlemen that they have a right to advocate their own cau&s;e, on the floor of this hou&s;e. But they will allow us to con&s;i|der, that it is their own cau&s;e they are advocating; and to
<PB N="73" REF="019884_0076_0FAD41929F14A270">
give credit to their opinions, and to think of their votes accordingly. And here I call the attention of the hou&s;e for a moment, to con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the parties engaged in this argument: If the bank is a common good&mdash;diffu&s;ing beneficial influences through the whole &s;tate&mdash;increa&s;ing the price of lands and produce&mdash;if we &s;aw it to be u&s;eful to the commonwealth&mdash;would it not be our own intere&s;t to encou|rage it? Can this hou&s;e &s;uppo&s;e us wicked enough to de&s;troy our own intere&s;t or the public's from mere envy? On the other hand, this hou&s;e mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that however hurtful and dangerous it is to the general good, the gentle|men on the other &s;ide are intere&s;ted in &s;upporting it: and if it were &s;afe and beneficial, it would al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our intere&s;t to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame worthy gentleman has told us, that the circula|tion and amount of the bank paper is little under&s;tood. This I believe is perfectly true. But is this a rea&s;on that we &s;hould grant a charter to the bank? Surely not. Shall the legi&s;la|ture of Penn&s;ylvania enact a charter for an in&s;titution they do not under&s;tand? Certainly every hone&s;t member on this floor, who does not fully under&s;tand the my&s;tery of banking, or who has a doubt upon his mind, of the &s;afety or utility of &s;uch an in&s;titution, will vote again&s;t the re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>Another worthy gentleman [mr. Morris] has told us, that it is his opinion, if the que&s;tion is to come before a court of ju&s;tice, the judges, though their opinions might be other|wi&s;e, yet on account of their characters as law officers, would condemn the repealing law, as a nullity. What! would the judges complement the bank by deciding contra|ry, not only to their own &s;entiments, but to law it&s;elf? If this be the ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be a very influencing in&s;titution, and a very dangerous one indeed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame worthy gentleman informs us, that if the bank is not continued, there will not, at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, be a &s;hip loaded with flour, at the port of Philadelphia. But I a&s;k, how were they loaded before the war? how were they, or how are they, loaded at Baltimore and other ports? Balti|more exports more in proportion to its imports than Phila|delphia does: and this is worthy of our ob&s;ervation. But as I have detained the hou&s;e longer than I de&s;igned, and as the gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed to advantage many arguments I had in view, I &s;hall conclude by offering a few more general ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="019884_0077_0FAD4193B3DB8340">
There is now no chartered bank exi&s;ting: therefore the ca&s;e is before us on original ground. The que&s;tion is not whether or no we will repeal a charter; but whether or no we will give one. Whether or no the la&s;t hou&s;e a&s;&s;igned proper rea&s;ons for what they did, is not our bu&s;ine&s;s: for we know they did no inju&s;tice to the bank. They took away none of the property. The holders have their money; therefore it was not like an agrarian law, as the gentleman alleged&mdash;They may &s;till keep a private bank. And here I beg leave to remark, that as a private bank is all the con&s;ti|tution admits of, &s;o it would have the &s;ame advantages in trade, and more &s;ecurity to the people than a chartered bank. For, under the charter, the incorporated property was the only &s;ecurity to the public: therefore the &s;tockhol|ders, who have the property of it, and draw the dividends from it, might be rolling in wealth, and the bank break and ruin thou&s;ands. The bank might be robbed, or thrown into the Delaware, and the owners who profit by it, be &s;afe as to their e&s;tates. None but men of wealth have money to &s;pare to be bankers: and &s;hall this hou&s;e give a &s;pecial law to enable monied people to increa&s;e their gain, without having either their per&s;ons or e&s;tates upon the &s;ame level of re&s;pon&s;ibility as the other citizens? By no means: this hou&s;e will not do it. If the legi&s;lature did &s;o, it would give a legal &s;anction to a &s;nare of the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>This is the only &s;tate in the union &s;addled with a bank. Our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, &s;en&s;ible of the magnitude and danger of &s;uch an in&s;titution, have, as far as I am informed, refu&s;ed to &s;anction it. Maryland and New York, I know, have done &s;o. They have &s;een the danger, and learned by our example. Let us for &s;ome time learn by theirs. Such an in&s;titution might in time be formidable to the whole united &s;tates.</P>
<P>I chearfully acknowledge, however, the great merit of the worthy gentleman who has informed us that he laid the plan of the bank, and led it into operations. I acknowledge that the bank has been of great &s;ervice to the united &s;tates&mdash;not in our darke&s;t times&mdash;for the&s;e were in &s;ome mea&s;ure over, when Cornwallis was taken&mdash;which was before the bank exi&s;ted. But the &s;ervice was reciprocal. It was part of the French money, to the value of which the united &s;tates became &s;tockholders, that enabled the bank to open its operations: and if that in&s;titution was, for a part of the next &s;ea&s;on, of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, it was but a &s;uitable return: and the financier, for making &s;o proper a u&s;e of it, de&s;erves
<PB N="75" REF="019884_0078_0FAD419453721A88">
and enjoys great credit. But the public are not indebted to this in&s;titution&mdash;or, if they are, they will doubtle&s;s give that debt a preference to debts even much earlier contracted. Congre&s;s money did us e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice in our darke&s;t hours: &s;hall it, therefore, be continued? No: it, became danger|ous; and con&s;equently cea&s;ed. The army were no longer ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and would have been dangerous; and were therefore di&s;continued. General Wa&s;hington, with all the virtue and glory of his per&s;evering &s;ervices, re&s;igned his honours and authority, when he cea&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;though he did not cea&s;e to be either u&s;eful or &s;afe. If we mu&s;t be &s;addled with this dangerous in&s;titution for ever, becau&s;e of its for|mer u&s;efulne&s;s and conveniency, &s;urely Oliver Cromwell &s;hould have been rewarded in England by the continuing his heirs to occupy the government, in&s;tead of being branded as a u&s;urper, and "damned to everla&s;ting &s;ame." By the &s;ame rule, de&s;potic government, which is the mo&s;t conve|nient, ought always to be preferred and continued.</P>
<P>One other ob&s;ervation occurs to me, which I have often thought of, and to which I yet reque&s;t the attention of the hou&s;e. If a bank is &s;upported in Philadelphia, it will give another kind of credit, and another kind of circulating me|dium to the city and its vicinity, than to the more remote parts of this extended &s;tate: and the bank may increa&s;e the circulating medium to any quantity it plea&s;es, which will occa&s;ion an artificial increa&s;e in the prices of things, and the manner of living. It will gradually affect the intere&s;ts, man|ners, and habits, with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing peculiarities, as will occa&s;ion &s;ooner or later a di&s;&s;olution or &s;eparation of this &s;tate. This would be a very unde&s;irable event: and yet the in&s;tituting a bank can &s;carcely fail producing it. Perhaps, when this event takes place, this city and a &s;mall territory around it, may, like Hamburgh and Dantzick, not only promote monopolies, but have its foundation placed in the principles of monopoly and ari&s;tocracy. For the common intere&s;t of Penn&s;ylvania, for the honour and advantage of human nature, I wi&s;h &s;uch events may be at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitz&s;imons. The gentleman has mis-&s;tated &s;ome of the ob&s;ervations I made. I did not &s;ay I had canva&s;&s;ed for my own &s;eat: that is not the truth. Whether my &s;eat is more beneficial to me, than that gentleman's to him, I leave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to judge.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Lollar. I beg to detain the hou&s;e a few minutes. A
<PB N="76" REF="019884_0079_0FAD419528F5FE10">
gentleman from the city [mr. R. Morris] has been a little facetious in his remarks on &s;ome of the arguments I made u&s;e of on Wedne&s;day. I confe&s;s his &s;uperior knowledge, and do not pretend to oppo&s;e mine to his. However, when a matter amounts to a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, I think my|&s;elf qualified to form an opinion on it. I &s;aid that the bank facilitated commerce&mdash;which, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our trade was again&s;t it, as it enabled the Briti&s;h creditor to car|ry off ca&s;h for his goods, and &s;addle the merchant here with the payment, in the ha&s;ty manner pre&s;cribed by the bank. from this he drew an inference, that I was oppo&s;ed to the payment of our debts&mdash;which is by no means the ca&s;e. With re&s;pect to partiality or favouriti&s;m, I did not charge the di|rectors with it&mdash;I only read part of the petition from Che&s;|ter county, pre&s;ented to the late hou&s;e again&s;t the bank, to evince how much was in their power. I &s;aid that under the old government, they had no idea of a bank. To this the gentleman an&s;wers, by telling us he, at that time, had one in contemplation. I do not doubt the fertility of the gen|tleman's imagination. He is certainly competent to the forming that or any &s;imilar plan: and probably the pre&s;ent bank is the very one he had then in view.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to call in que&s;tion the u&s;efulne&s;s of the bank during the war. The officers and &s;oldiers of our ar|my were likewi&s;e u&s;eful during the war: but would we infer from thence that they &s;hould be &s;till kept up? The profits of the bank have well paid for its &s;ervices. Our officers and &s;oldiers have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a commutation of pay for five years.</P>
<P>The gentleman tells us, that if the legi&s;lature were to grant a monopoly of particular branches of our trade to any &s;et of men, the laws granting &s;uch monopoly, would be void in them&s;elves; and &s;eems to think that the law annul|ling the charter of the bank, is a nullity&mdash;If that be the ca&s;e, the incorporating law was equally a nullity.</P>
<P>Another member from the city tells us, he has had the honour of being a director of the bank &s;ince its fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. He might have added, that &s;o he would remain during life, if the pre&s;ent mode of voting according to pro|perty, continued. In the bank of England, (if I am rightly informed) every per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;hare of 500l. has a vote; and tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a number of &s;hares, no more.</P>
<P>When another bank was attempted to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in this city, the pre&s;ident and directors, by lowering their
<PB N="77" REF="019884_0080_0FAD4195D3293660">
terms, drew it into their vortex: and thus defeated the at|tempt.</P>

<P>RESUMED the con&s;ideration of the report, &amp;c. Mr. R. Morris. The gentlemen from the country, by fix|ing &s;uch &s;hort adjournments, make this a hard &s;ervice. They &s;carcely allow us time to take a comfortable dinner and gla&s;s of wine, before we are obliged to return to the charge: how|ever, though they are impatient to return home, they &s;hould allow us time to con&s;ider and dige&s;t the arguments u&s;ed up|on this floor. It would be but decent to do &s;o. I &s;hall now endeavour to follow and di&s;cu&s;s the arguments of tho&s;e gen|tlemen who have &s;poken again&s;t the bank in the pre&s;ent de|bate: many of them I con&s;ider as totally unnece&s;&s;ary; and &s;uch I mean to pa&s;s by unnoticed.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Cumberland began his oration by tel|ling us, that he &s;till retained his own opinion; and &s;hould continue to do &s;o, until he heard better rea&s;ons than tho&s;e yet offered. I never heard any declaration from that gentle|man's lips, which obtained more credit with me than this. I do &s;incerely believe, that he does and will retain his opi|nion. Even were an angel from heaven &s;ent with proper ar|guments to convince him of his error, it would make no al|teration with him. I did not&mdash;I could not entertain the lea&s;t expectation that my colleagues or my&s;elf &s;hould be able to produce any effect upon &s;o predetermined a mind as his.</P>
<P>This gentleman went into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the report now before us, in which I do not mean to follow him. The com|mittee who brought in that report, have ju&s;tified it: and I have already given it all the &s;upport which to me appears ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>He has admitted that the committee of the late hou&s;e made no enquiries re&s;pecting the bank, although they were directed to do &s;o: and &s;eems to in&s;i&s;t that &s;uch enquiries were unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the popular opinions, he &s;ays, were again&s;t the bank. But where did he collect the popu|lar
<PB N="78" REF="019884_0081_0FAD419692485028">
opinions? How were &s;uch opinions communicated? Had he, indeed, &s;aid that the opinion of a party was again&s;t it, he would have &s;aid right. But was the popular opinion com|municated by 1199 petitioners, even when oppo&s;ed by up|wards of 600 remon&s;trants? According to the doctrine of another gentleman on his &s;ide of the que&s;tion, near 3000 petitioners (unoppo&s;ed) do not at this time convey the po|pular opinion. But even if we &s;uppo&s;e the late hou&s;e to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the popular opinion, I deny that this was proper ground, on which to found legi&s;lative acts: nor can it warrant or ju&s;tify the proceedings of the late a&s;&s;embly with regard to the bank. Popular opinions originate with in|dividuals: fal&s;e appearances are frequently given by tho&s;e who have &s;ecret de&s;igns: and men for the mo&s;t part take them on tru&s;t. Specious arguments and groundle&s;s a&s;&s;er|tions take place of rea&s;on; and run away with what is cal|led popular opinions. The conduct of an a&s;&s;embly founded upon &s;uch opinions, will not &s;upport it&s;elf. If our laws are to be enacted in conformity with popular opinions, they mu&s;t be altered as &s;uch opinions change, which generally happens every two or three months: for opinions, taken up ha&s;tily, and propagated for party purpo&s;es, cannot hold long. If, indeed, a popular opinion appears to have rea&s;on and ju&s;tice for its ba&s;is, then it is well to make it the ground of our proceedings. But who is to judge? The repre&s;enta|tives of the people: and when popular opinions run counter to rea&s;on, they &s;hould counteract their influence, by &s;hew|ing them to be wrong, and not pa&s;s acts in compliance with them.</P>
<P>The gentleman complains, that the committee of the late hou&s;e have been cen&s;ured for not calling at the bank&mdash;laying great &s;tre&s;s upon&mdash;"calling at." If that committee thought it incon&s;i&s;tent with their dignity to call at the bank, they might have obtained the nece&s;&s;ary information without cal|ling there. The pre&s;ident and directors would have waited upon that committee as readily as they have done on the committee of this hou&s;e; and would have an&s;wered &s;uch que&s;tions as they might have thought proper to put to them. But he a&s;ks, "of what u&s;e would it have been, to make en|quiry at the bank? Would the pre&s;ident and directors have made an&s;wer to criminate them&s;elves? Would they have told us that the in&s;titution was dangerous to the welfare of the &s;tate?" To this I an&s;wer, that had proper que&s;tions been a&s;ked, proper an&s;wers might have been obtained: and al|though
<PB N="79" REF="019884_0082_0FAD41975D3B17E0">
the pre&s;ident and directors would not criminate them|&s;elves, yet we know, that, in the examination of witne&s;&s;es, truth is frequently di&s;covered, even when endeavours are made to conceal it. But, in this ca&s;e, there could have been no cau&s;e of concealment.</P>
<P>I have mentioned in the cour&s;e of this debate, that had the committee called upon me, I &s;hould have given them, (and upon oath if required) the &s;ame information re&s;pecting the &s;ervices derived by the united &s;tates from the bank, as I have had the honour to relate to this hou&s;e. The gentleman a&s;ks, why apply to me, who would have given the &s;ame kind of an&s;wers as the pre&s;ident and directors? Let us examine the force of this rea&s;oning. I am no otherwi&s;e intere&s;ted in the bank, than as a &s;tockholder; and my bank &s;tock is more ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;ed of, or parted with, than any other of my property, except ca&s;h. Suppo&s;e, then, that inclination, ne|ce&s;&s;ity, or any other circum&s;tance, &s;hould happen to induce me to &s;ell my &s;tock, from that moment I cea&s;e to be imme|diately or per&s;onally intere&s;ted in that in&s;titution. But this is not the ca&s;e with me as a member of the community. My landed e&s;tate&mdash;my family&mdash;and likewi&s;e the intere&s;t I hold in common with other citizens&mdash;mu&s;t attach me too &s;trongly to the general welfare of the &s;tate, to admit of a po&s;&s;ibility that I &s;hould engage in the &s;upport of an in&s;titution incom|patible with the public &s;afety. Should I &s;ell my &s;tock, the purcha&s;er becomes intere&s;ted in the &s;upport of the in&s;titution, in&s;tead of my being &s;o: and in that ca&s;e, I &s;hould be no otherwi&s;e concerned in its &s;upport, than as a citizen believ|ing it to be of general benefit: and as &s;uch I am per&s;uaded that I &s;hould as &s;olicitous as I am at pre&s;ent. The gentle|men oppo&s;ed to the bank con&s;tantly hold out the idea, that the per&s;ons intere&s;ted in it, are always the &s;ame&mdash;and that it is a monopoly confined to a few. Now it is certain, that on the contrary, the property in bank &s;tock is con&s;tantly changing hands. Where, then, is this permanent intere&s;t that &s;hould induce us to &s;acrifice the good of the country to the good of that e&s;tabli&s;hment? The market is con&s;tantly open for the &s;ale and purcha&s;e of this bank &s;tock: and if the gentlemen in oppo&s;ition &s;eriou&s;ly believe in the advanta|ges which they &s;ay are derived from holding that &s;tock, why do they not inve&s;t &s;ome part of their property in it&mdash;for property they have&mdash;and there are always &s;hares to be &s;old?</P>
<P>The holders of that &s;tock differ as widely, I pre&s;ume, in their political principles, views, pur&s;uits and de&s;ires, as the
<PB N="80" REF="019884_0083_0FAD41980A555708">
holders of lands, hou&s;es, or other property. The&s;e gentle|men may, when they plea&s;e, be of the number. How, then, is this cry of monopoly &s;upported? My information is not to be tru&s;ted, becau&s;e I am intere&s;ted in the bank: but &s;urely I am more deeply intere&s;ted in the &s;tate&mdash;and that in a way too that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for me to detach my&s;elf from it, were I &s;o inclined. But very different is my &s;itua|tion with re&s;pect to the bank. I am as deeply concerned to obtain good laws, and to enforce the due execution of them, as any gentleman in this hou&s;e: and I hope, notwith&s;tand|ing the in&s;inuation made, that it will never be &s;uppo&s;ed I would &s;acrifice the intere&s;t and welfare of the &s;tate to any intere&s;t I can po&s;&s;ibly hold in the bank.</P>
<P>Such of the members of this hou&s;e, as are di&s;po&s;ed to give a fair and candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to the arguments u&s;ed in this debate, will &s;ee clearly that the bank is neither danger|ous to, nor incompatible with, the welfare of the &s;tate: and the&s;e were the a&s;&s;umed principles upon which the re|pealing law was founded. If that a&s;&s;umption was taken up lightly and upon fal&s;e grounds, as my rea&s;oning tends to prove, I hope gentlemen will give that rea&s;oning its ju&s;t weight: for I cannot &s;ee why it &s;hould lo&s;e its force, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of my being intere&s;ted in the event. Let the arguments u&s;ed, be con&s;idered, not as coming from parties intere&s;ted, but ab&s;tractedly as to their force and &s;olidity.</P>
<P>The gentleman tells us, that the bank i&s;&s;ues paper on the credit of the money in its vaults&mdash;and that its di&s;counts being confined to forty-five days, the farmer can derive no benefit from &s;uch limited loans. If the &s;tate will depo&s;it hard money in the hands of the trea&s;urer, for the purpo&s;e of exchanging it on demand for the paper they may i&s;&s;ue on the credit of &s;uch depo&s;its, no doubt can be entertained but the &s;tate paper, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, will have full credit.</P>
<P>In the notes which I have taken of the &s;peeches of my opponents, I &s;o frequently meet with paper money&mdash;paper money&mdash;paper money&mdash;that it will be impracticable for me to follow them throughout on that topic, and &s;peak to it as often as they have done. I find, however, this is the great &s;ore; and cannot help expre&s;&s;ing my a&s;toni&s;hment at this con&s;tant cry for paper money by the country gentlemen, when it is notorious that they will not &s;ell the produce of their farms for it. No merchant, with ever &s;o much paper money at command, can purcha&s;e the produce of the coun|try
<PB N="81" REF="019884_0084_0FAD4198E076A370">
for exportation. Therefore I cannot a&s;cribe this con&s;tant clamour about paper money to any other cau&s;e than a de&s;ire to pay debts with le&s;s than their ju&s;t amount, or to purcha&s;e lands at le&s;s than their value. I in&s;i&s;t that there is no nece&s;&s;i|ty for paper money. No indu&s;trious man, in his individual capacity, can feel a want of it: and wherever it is emitted, it will be more likely to produce public mi&s;chief than public good. This que&s;tion of paper money has been agitated in &s;everal of the &s;tates; and been rejected by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Rhode I&s;land, New Jer&s;ey, and Maryland: it is now pending in New York, where it is &s;aid it will al&s;o be rejected. I think I may &s;afely &s;ay that this cry for paper money is not a popu|lar cry, whil&s;t tho&s;e who a&s;k it, refu&s;e to give it currency, by refu&s;ing to part with their produce for it. Yet the&s;e &s;ame patriots are con&s;tantly reproaching the bank as the cau&s;e of that want of credit, which them&s;elves occa&s;ion to the paper money.</P>
<P>The gentleman complained that the members of the com|mittee of the late hou&s;e were called upon to defend them|&s;elves. It is true, they &s;tand charged with not having done their duty: but they are at liberty to defend them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the charge, if they can, or to let it alone. He &s;aid al&s;o that it is indecent to inve&s;tigate the proceedings of a former hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly. But if he examines the journals, he will find precedents; and &s;ee that other hou&s;es have can|va&s;&s;ed the conduct of their predece&s;&s;ors, and even that he has him&s;elf been an active agent therein. He mu&s;t not expect to e&s;cape &s;crutiny; nor mu&s;t this hou&s;e. Tho&s;e among&s;t us, who may be returned to occupy tho&s;e &s;eats next year, may be called upon to ju&s;tify the conduct of this hou&s;e, or of them&s;elves: for my part, I hope to retire, and remain a pri|vate citizen, which &s;uits both my inclination and affairs much better than to be in public life, for which I do not find my|&s;elf very well qualified; and am, therefore, inclined to leave my place to tho&s;e that are. But &s;o long as I act a part in public life, &s;o long I expect my conduct to be examined: and however di&s;agreeable this may be to &s;ome gentlemen, there is no remedy but to bear it patiently.</P>
<P>All the gentlemen who have &s;poken again&s;t the bank, have plumed them&s;elves much upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that the learned coun&s;el who pleaded the cau&s;e of that in&s;titution be|fore the late a&s;&s;embly, had conceded this point, that when the balance of trade is again&s;t a country, a bank is injurious to that country. I am well acquainted with that gentle|man's
<PB N="82" REF="019884_0085_0FAD419989404940">
exten&s;ive abilities, and &s;hall ever acknowledge them&mdash;but with all deference, I &s;hall venture to &s;ay, that if he made &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion, he was not authori&s;ed either by his employers, or by the fact. But was &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion made? examine the whole of his rea&s;oning on that point, he, I am authori&s;ed to &s;ay, con&s;iders it differently. Such a conce&s;|&s;ion was neither intended nor meant to be made by him. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of our trade, when the balance is again&s;t us, may be, and is extremely injurious to the operations of the bank&mdash;not the bank injurious to trade or the country: and it is that which the learned coun&s;el had in view, if I am not much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The balance of trade is much &s;poken of in this debate: but I doubt if it be a &s;ubject well under&s;tood. Since the con|clu&s;ion of the war, the balance of trade has been again&s;t us, and &s;till continues to be &s;o. The cau&s;e I have already &s;tated impart, when I mentioned that the &s;anguine expectations which foreigners formed of reaping immen&s;e profits by ad|venturing to this country, had cau&s;ed &s;uch va&s;t importations of manufactures, as will require time to enable us to di&s;|charge the &s;um for which they were &s;old to our citizens.</P>
<P>The evils con&s;equent to &s;uch immen&s;e importations, are at an end. The fir&s;t adventurers have paid &s;o dearly for their ra&s;h undertakings, and &s;o many have been ruined, that this adventurous &s;pirit is cured. Our own importers have been involved in the general calamity. Each imported goods agreeably to what he thought the wants of the country: and having &s;old them to &s;hopkeepers and others, who, from the then &s;tate of cultivation of the country, and con&s;equent deficiency of produce, were unable to pay, they are di&s;abled from making remittances: and for want of tho&s;e remittan|ces, their credit, if not totally lo&s;t, is greatly injured in Eu|rope; &s;o that it will not &s;peedily be in their power to renew exce&s;&s;ive importations. This lo&s;s of credit may be con&s;idered in a two-&s;old point of view&mdash;either as a misfortune, or as of &s;ervice to the country in general&mdash;which it will prove, is in the womb of time to &s;hew: but I am of opinion, that wi&s;e laws, calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h punctuality in our dealings, may turn the pre&s;ent lo&s;s of credit to future advantage. The people are falling into their former habits of indu&s;try and frugality. We may, therefore, rea&s;onably expect that agriculture will flouri&s;h, and the &s;tate of cultivation in A|merica &s;urpa&s;s what was its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition previ|ous to the revolution. The balance of trade will then be
<PB N="83" REF="019884_0086_0FAD419C482A2238">
turned in our favour: and &s;pecie will return as fa&s;t as it has lately been drained away. This &s;ituation of things is not very di&s;tant: and there is no occa&s;ion to de&s;troy the bank on account of the balance of trade on which it has no influence.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that &s;o great an e&s;tate as that of the bank, in the hands of a few, mu&s;t be dangerous. This is &s;uppo&s;ing the capital of ten millions of dollars to be completed; and that in that ca&s;e, it mu&s;t carry all before it: whereas the pre|&s;ent capital does not amount to one million, which belongs to many, and not to a few. And the &s;tock cannot be accu|mulated, &s;o as to be injurious, as the gentlemen a&s;&s;ert, and &s;till be confined to the hands of a few per&s;ons: for it can only accumulate by increa&s;ing the number of &s;tockholders. I &s;hould not have touched upon this, but to &s;hew the falla|cy of their arguments.</P>
<P>The member from Cumberland complains, that the a&s;|&s;embly which granted the charter, did not know the bye|laws and regulations previous to making the grant. True, they did not: and they mu&s;t have been witches, indeed, to have known them, for I believe they were not then formed: but any thing will &s;erve as a charge again&s;t the bank: and this may do as well as any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>He a&s;ks, <Q>how can the farmers derive benefit from the bank? If they cannot obtain loans, they cannot rai&s;e produce; and they cannot have loans without a loan of|fice; and without produce, we can have no trade; we cannot have a loan office without paper money; and we cannot get hard money to &s;upply our nece&s;&s;ities, for it is in the bank,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. Having already an&s;wered in the cour&s;e of the debate, tho&s;e points which are urged and re|peated again and again, without regard to what has been &s;aid in contradiction or explanation&mdash;I &s;hall now only ob&s;erve, that &s;o long as men are made as they are at pre&s;ent, they will cultivate the earth, and rai&s;e produce: whether this is effected by the mere efforts of indu&s;try, or with the aid of loans, is immaterial: and while there is produce to &s;pare, there will be commerce. Therefore let the landed and com|mercial intere&s;t &s;hake hands, for they do and mu&s;t promote each others advantage.</P>
<P>This member again a&s;&s;erts, that there is not hard money &s;ufficient for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a loan office&mdash;it is in the bank. A &s;tranger hearing this complaint &s;o often repeated, would &s;uppo&s;e that all the hard money in the &s;tate was in the bank, and no po&s;&s;ibility to come at it; that it was locked up
<PB N="84" REF="019884_0087_0FAD419D64B94A78">
there, and the people deprived of all u&s;e of it. Hundreds here pre&s;ent know the contrary. Whoever vi&s;its the bank, will &s;ee &s;ome people con&s;tantly bringing in money, and &s;ome taking it away:&mdash;the bank being, with re&s;pect to the circu|lation of &s;pecie, as the heart to the circulation of blood.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman &s;ays, that the bank has made &s;ixteen per cent. by its &s;tock, or perhaps more&mdash;and that this mu&s;t be done by extortion. He &s;hould have been tender of ma|king this charge without being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of proofs to &s;upport it. If he can prove it, I &s;hall not offer another word in fa|vour of the bank.</P>
<P>Mr. Whitehill. I did not &s;ay it was by extortion.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon the matter, but &s;hall take the gentleman's own explanation. I have already &s;aid, and I am warranted in a&s;&s;erting it, that the profits of the bank do not exceed 8 per cent. on an average. At the time the high dividends were made, the capital of the bank was &s;mall, and the exigencies of the united &s;tates required large advances and di&s;counts&mdash;there were, be&s;ides, numerous private calls for di&s;counts which could not be refu&s;ed: and the directors were compelled to di&s;count more heavily in pro|portion to their &s;tock than they wi&s;hed. During that period, the united &s;tates &s;hared in tho&s;e dividends of 10 to 16 per cent. per annum, and paid only 6 per cent. per an|num for what they borrowed. The&s;e high profits aro&s;e from accidental circum&s;tances, as I have mentioned, and, if need|ful, can prove&mdash;for I know the fact to be &s;o.</P>
<P>In my notes I meet with a jumble of a&s;&s;ertions made by this member&mdash;but no attempt to an&s;wer the arguments I of|fered ye&s;terday. The gentleman a&s;ks, &s;hall the &s;tate give way to the bank, or the bank to the &s;tate? and adds, that the bank &s;hould not interfere with the &s;tate. By the &s;tate I &s;uppo&s;e he means a party in the &s;tate. I wi&s;h the &s;tate had not interfered with the bank&mdash;and the bank would never in|terfere with the &s;tate.</P>
<P>He &s;peaks with &s;everity of the trouble the hou&s;e have had with the bank&mdash;how frequently it has been before the a&s;&s;em|blies&mdash;and the wa&s;te of time and money thereby occa&s;ioned. The bu&s;ine&s;s of a bank was fir&s;t brought before the a&s;&s;embly of this &s;tate, by recommendation of congre&s;s. It became a duty of the pre&s;ident and directors to apply to that hou&s;e for a charter: they did &s;o, and it was obtained. The &s;econd time the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank applied to the legi&s;lature, was in oppo&s;ition to an application made by cer|tain
<PB N="85" REF="019884_0088_0FAD419EEB4D1158">
per&s;ons inimical to the exi&s;ting bank, for an act to e&s;ta|bli&s;h another. This attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h another bank, had for its object, the de&s;truction of the bank of North America. The motives were neither founded in rea&s;on nor any de&s;ire to promote the public welfare: and the pre&s;ident and direc|tors conceived it a duty due to their con&s;tituents that they &s;hould come before that a&s;&s;embly and endeavour to &s;hew the pernicious tendency of that mea&s;ure. The third time they appeared, was in oppo&s;ition to certain petitions, praying to have their charter taken away. I &s;uppo&s;e the gentleman thought them trouble&s;ome at that time, as well as now: but their appearance was then unavoidable. The petitioners in this third in&s;tance, as well as in the &s;econd, brought them before the hou&s;e. And how is the bank brought before us now, for the fourth time? The &s;tockholders had determi|ned not to trouble us&mdash;they had determined on an appeal to another place: therefore the memorial of the pre&s;ident and directors pre&s;ented the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, is not the foundation of the pre&s;ent proceedings. But a large number of our fellow citizens have, by petition and memorial, called upon this hou&s;e to repeal the law pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t year for annulling the charter of the bank. If the gentleman finds it trouble&s;ome to receive &s;uch petitions, let him &s;ay &s;o; and not cry out again&s;t the pre&s;ident and directors as if they cau&s;ed the trou|ble he complains of; for it is not &s;o.</P>
<P>The gentleman &s;ays, this hou&s;e does not know the &s;tate of the bank, or whether the pre&s;ident and directors are able to pay their notes. To which I an&s;wer, that this hou&s;e has no right to know the &s;tate of the bank. We are not a&s;ked to tru&s;t them, or to take their notes. Tho&s;e who entru&s;t their money in the bank, or take its notes, may a&s;k &s;uch que&s;tions: but I believe they do not think it nece&s;&s;ary: if they did, I am per&s;uaded that full and ample &s;atisfaction would be given. He &s;ays, that the memoriali&s;ts in favour of the bank, do not under&s;tand the nature of it. I believe they know at lea&s;t as much as the petitioners again&s;t it. The memoriali&s;ts have pretty generally felt the benefits re&s;ulting from it:&mdash;tho&s;e from the country, by finding a quick &s;ale and ready money for their produce, and receiving this ready money at the bank, &s;aw that the in&s;titution was beneficial and convenient: and &s;o &s;eeing, they can ea&s;ily comprehend that the attempt to &s;uppre&s;s it is injurious to the country.</P>
<P>As to the number of &s;igners to tho&s;e memorials or peti|tions in favor of the bank, this gentleman lays no &s;tre&s;s on
<PB N="86" REF="019884_0089_0FAD419FAC5092F0">
them: for with proper exertions of indu&s;try, &s;ays he, twenty or thirty thou&s;and &s;igners might be got to expunge the bank. In &s;hort, this gentleman is con&s;tantly making a&s;&s;ertions, which he cannot, or does not, &s;upport with argument: and therefore I mu&s;t meet him with an a&s;&s;ertion in this point, which is, that with le&s;s exertion or indu&s;try can twenty or thirty thou&s;and &s;igners be obtained in &s;upport of the bank.</P>
<P>Having now done with the member from Cumberland, I proceed to examine the arguments adduced by a gentleman,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Finlay.</NOTE> for who&s;e under&s;tanding and abilities I have great re&s;pect; and who generally &s;upports what he undertakes to defend, not only with &s;trength of rea&s;oning, but manages it with candour. I cannot, however, help ob&s;erving, that he has deviated more from that candid line of conduct in this debate, than I have ever known him to do before.</P>
<P>He &s;ays the pre&s;ent hou&s;e is not to enquire into what has been done by the late one&mdash;but whether &s;ufficient rea&s;ons now exi&s;t, to warrant a renewal of the charter; and adds, that in all governments there mu&s;t be a power lodged &s;ome|where, which has a right to give and a right to take away.</P>
<P>I agree that in all governments, &s;upreme power mu&s;t be lodged &s;omewhere. In ours, the a&s;&s;embly has the &s;ole right of granting charters&mdash;but no right to take them away. The power there goes on a different principle: and &s;o it does in all except arbitrary governments. In Great Britain, the &s;overeign grants charters, but he cannot take them away: the laws of the land have pointed out another mode of annulling them. As well may it be &s;aid that the a&s;&s;em|bly of this &s;tate, having exerci&s;ed their &s;overeign authority in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a land office, from whence grants of lands are made to individuals, have a right to exerci&s;e the &s;ame &s;overeign authority by de&s;troying that office, and re&s;uming the lands again. This would be exerci&s;ing the power to give, and the power to take away: but the a&s;&s;em|bly has no right to &s;uch power: if it has, God help us! There are certain forms by which an individual may lo&s;e his lands; but never, I hope, by a wanton act of legi&s;lative power. A con&s;iderable part of its time has been &s;pent by this hou&s;e in granting charters of incorporation to religious &s;ocieties, which are a&s;ked for the purpo&s;e of enabling them to receive donations and legacies, for the &s;upport of mini|&s;ters and payment of contingent charges, &amp;c. If tho&s;e charters may be revoked at will, I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee it done a few years hence, on &s;ome pretence or other.
<PB N="87" REF="019884_0090_0FAD41A070A1B8E8">
What then is to become of the capital they may have re&s;pec|tively accumulated by means of the donations and legacies received in the mean time? Probably a certain gentleman, who is fond of e&s;cheats, may, if then in power, urge that the &s;tate &s;hould be heir to the corporations which &s;uffer political death. What a hopeful &s;ituation mu&s;t the country be in, under &s;uch &s;y&s;tems as the&s;e! This gentleman &s;ays, let us examine our government&mdash;It is a democracy, and gives to all men equal rights: and agrarian laws may not be in|compatible with the &s;pirit of it: but we are not yet arrived at the period when &s;uch laws would be proper. I tru&s;t this member has better principles than to advocate &s;o wicked a mea&s;ure as a general divi&s;ion of property</P>
<P>Mr. Finlay. I beg leave to explain. What I &s;aid, was, that agrarian laws would be unju&s;t in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. They are unju&s;t in all ca&s;es. The gen|tleman has remarked, "that wealth has a tendency to coun|teract our manners and the principles of our government. Why then &s;hould we give &s;anction, &s;ays he, to an in&s;titution founded on wealth? The &s;tockholders mu&s;t be men of wealth," &amp;c.</P>
<P>If wealth be &s;o obnoxious, I a&s;k this gentleman why is he &s;o eager in the pur&s;uit of it? I frequently &s;ee him vi&s;iting the land office: Tho&s;e vi&s;its, I pre&s;ume, are not for pa&s;|time; although I do not doubt but they are for very proper purpo&s;es.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Finlay. I never took up a foot of land in my life. What bu&s;ine&s;s I have tran&s;acted at that office, has been to &s;erve others.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. I have heard that &s;ome of the country gentlemen, whil&s;t they are here attending in a&s;&s;embly, take up lands for their neighbours&mdash;and receive &s;o much per cent. for tran&s;acting the bu&s;ine&s;s in the office.</P>
<P>Mr. Finlay. I mu&s;t again &s;et the gentleman right. I never received a farthing for &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s in my life.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. The gentleman has told us they had no banks in Rome, during the days of the republic. The Ro|mans were a very different &s;ort of people from the Penn&s;yl|vanians. They did in their days what they thought right and proper for them to do: but their conduct in this re&s;pect can never &s;erve as a rule for ours.</P>
<P>"The object of the bank, he &s;ays, is gain&mdash;It is managed by them&s;elves, that is, by the &s;tockholders&mdash;and they have it always in view to <HI>lift</HI> their gain&mdash;Equality is the darling
<PB N="88" REF="019884_0091_0FAD41A11BA335E8">
of our government&mdash;and the con&s;titution &s;ays government is in&s;tituted to pre&s;erve equal privileges, &amp;c.&mdash;the bank, he &s;ays, cannot be common among&s;t the citizens, and is there|fore contrary to the con&s;titution&mdash;and being perpetual, it is contrary to our laws, habits, manners," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The charter of the bank being perpetual, is made u&s;e of as a &s;trong argument again&s;t it: but really I do not know why we are told that the con&s;titution is liable to change eve|ry &s;even years; and therefore it is inferred that the bank &s;hould not have longer duration: although the charter is perpetual, the &s;tockholders are and will be con&s;tantly chang|ing. It has been &s;aid that the charter is only a piece of pa|per, which the hou&s;e may throw in the fire at plea&s;ure. I &s;ay it did not derive its value from its being written on paper, but from having received the &s;anction of the legi&s;lature, which the hou&s;e cannot &s;o ea&s;ily get rid of, as of the paper.</P>
<P>How does it appear that the bank is not common to our citizens? All of them who have money and inclination, may buy &s;hares, or depo&s;it there, at plea&s;ure. How does it appear that the bank is contrary to our laws, habits, manners and cu&s;toms? While the law incorporating the bank had exi&s;tence, it certainly was con&s;i&s;tent with our laws: and continues &s;o now, while conducted as a private bank, again&s;t which there is no law. It con&s;i&s;ts well with our ha|bits and cu&s;toms&mdash;for we find the people in the daily habit and cu&s;tom of lodging their money in the bank, and taking it away again at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This gentleman has &s;poken of the low ebb of our com|merce; and &s;ays it is almo&s;t entirely confined to importation: and he has remarked upon what fell from me, relative to Ireland not being a commercial nation. I hope I did not wound the gentleman's feelings, nor tho&s;e of any other Iri&s;hman who heard me: it was far from my intention. I have been in Ireland&mdash;have experienced the ho&s;pitality of its inhabitants&mdash;and will venture to &s;ay, there are few peo|ple, not Iri&s;h, who entertain greater e&s;teem for the country and people than I do: many of my intimacies are with gen|tlemen from that country&mdash;&s;ome of whom are now my hear|ers, and know the truth of what I &s;ay. All I meant was, that Ireland was not the mo&s;t proper country in the world, to furni&s;h us with precedents in commercial matters. I am not now to learn, that &s;he exports large quantities of beef, butter and pork, and &s;ome manufactures: but &s;till her trade is confined. I hope &s;he has now laid the foundation for an
<PB N="89" REF="019884_0092_0FAD41A1DEA2E928">
enlarged commerce: and none will rejoice more than I &s;hall, to &s;ee it extended to her greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>The commerce of America is really, as the gentleman &s;ays, at a low ebb. It was on a much more re&s;pectable foot|ing before the late war, than it is at pre&s;ent. We then ex|ported large quantities of wheat, flour, Indian corn, beef, butter, pork, iron, lumber, and other articles, from this port. The neighbouring provinces made the like exports. New-England exported fi&s;h, oil, whalebone, &amp;c. Maryland and Virginia, tobacco, provi&s;ions, iron, lumber, &amp;c. North Carolina, naval &s;tores; South Carolina and Georgia, rice, indigo, peltries, &amp;c. and every part of the continent had &s;taple commodities &s;uited to the con&s;umption of foreign mar|kets, which enabled us to pay for the things we had occa&s;ion to import. Certain it is, that our exports are now much le&s;s than they were then, which is &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing, as every article of produce commands a good price, and nothing remains on hand to peri&s;h for want of purcha&s;ers. Whether this decrea&s;e of exports is the con&s;equence of le&s;s culture of the country, or of an increa&s;ed home con&s;umption, I cannot decide. But this is certain, that the returning ha|bits of indu&s;try, with the daily progre&s;s of population, mu&s;t give an amazing increa&s;e of produce for exportation: and I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed, were this to happen much &s;ooner than even the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations point out. If the po&s;ition be true, that we are in a mi&s;erable &s;ituation &s;o long as our imports exceed our exports&mdash;I hope it will be admit|ted, and &s;oon be experienced, that the rever&s;e of that po&s;i|tion will place us in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate. But that the bank facilitates tho&s;e importations, I have already denied; and have in &s;ome degree proved the contrary: and were it nece&s;|&s;ary, further proof might be adduced, although it &s;eems im|proper to prove a negative.</P>
<P>The gentleman ob&s;erves that after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank, a great number of bankruptcies happened. But what is this to the bank? If he means to charge the bank as the cau&s;e of them, he ought to have &s;hewn it, and to have named the in&s;tances. But he could do neither the one nor the other. Tho&s;e bankruptcies were occa&s;ioned by very different circum&s;tances: particularly many of them were occa&s;ioned by the parties having at the approach of peace, (which they did not fore&s;ee or believe) imported or purcha&s;|ed large quantities of goods, which had co&s;t the advanced prices of war time, with the high rates of freight and in|&s;urance&mdash;&s;o
<PB N="90" REF="019884_0093_0FAD41A292179780">
that from the large importations &s;ub&s;equent to the conclu&s;ion of peace, at a lower co&s;t, and va&s;tly cheaper rates of freight and in&s;urance, they were di&s;abled from &s;el|ling tho&s;e goods but at an immen&s;e lo&s;s. The vendues were crouded with them&mdash;tho&s;e who were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, being forced to &s;ell: and &s;everal who were able to &s;tand the &s;hock, have of tho&s;e dear-bought goods, many on hands to this day. The&s;e are among&s;t the circum&s;tances that brought on the greater part of tho&s;e bankruptcies which are alluded to. But is the bank to be charged as acce&s;&s;ory thereto, merely be|cau&s;e they happened about that time? Surely not: on the contrary, many were &s;aved by the &s;ea&s;onable aids which they derived from it.</P>
<P>He &s;ays the arts of the directors of the bank, to prevent exportation of &s;pecie, are contemptible. One of the charg|es made again&s;t the bank, is, that it has a direct tendency to bani&s;h &s;pecie: In defending it again&s;t this charge, it is fir&s;t &s;hewn that the bank is intere&s;ted in preventing the export of &s;pecie; and then &s;ome of the means made u&s;e of, are men|tioned: upon this, the cry is changed: the gentleman lo&s;es &s;ight of the fir&s;t charge, and exclaims that the arts u&s;ed, are contemptible. Why &s;hould we not, &s;ays he, pay our debts, when we have contracted them? I agree that we ought and mu&s;t pay our debts: and other means failing, the &s;pecie mu&s;t go for the purpo&s;e: and as we agree in this, I hope he will al&s;o agree to exculpate the bank from the charge of bani&s;h|ing the &s;pecie: for the bank neither encourages, gives aid, or facility to the contracting of tho&s;e debts: the bank gives neither credit nor &s;ecurity for debts contracted in Europe: and it is for the payment of tho&s;e debts that &s;pecie is ex|ported.</P>
<P>Our importations, he &s;ays, are too exten&s;ive. Agreed: but why bring this in as a charge again&s;t the bank? Has the bank engaged in commerce? Have the pre&s;ident and direc|tors made any importations for the benefit of the in&s;titu|tion? No. They are re&s;trained by the charter from engag|ing in commerce.</P>
<P>The influence of the bank is again brought up. I have al|ready ob&s;erved, that &s;uch influence, if it exi&s;ts at all, can never extend beyond the city: and even there, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ometimes refu&s;ing di&s;counts, creates more enemies, than granting them makes friends. Probably, the gentleman may think that I &s;tand indebted to this kind of influence for my &s;eat in this hou&s;e; but I promi&s;e him, that if I had
<PB N="91" REF="019884_0094_0FAD41A3D1B81A30">
thought &s;o, I would not have accepted it. I am of too in|dependent a &s;pirit to accept any &s;tation or office that can be offered to me, unle&s;s I were convinced that the offer was made from public confidence in my being able to render the &s;ervice expected of me. This influence has never exi&s;ted: neither my colleagues nor my&s;elf owe any thing to it.</P>
<P>The gentleman has found a very ingenious argument to prove that our pre&s;ent paper money has the confidence of the people&mdash;that is, its quick circulation. But I attribute that quickne&s;s of circulation to a totally different cau&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the want of that confidence. It began to be i&s;&s;ued in July la&s;t: and nearly the whole of the emi&s;&s;ion had returned into the trea&s;ury in October or November. It was pu&s;hed from hand to hand, like the lighted &s;tick in the play of "Jack's alive, and alive like to be," each holder fearing that it &s;hould die in his hands: and it is laughable to hear this gentleman congratulate the &s;tate on the returning confidence and virtue of the people, in receiving and paying this paper &s;o quick. I mu&s;t claim my &s;hare of this merit: for I ac|knowledge, I have a&s;&s;i&s;ted this quick circulation (&s;o much admired by the worthy member) by parting with it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after it came to my hands.</P>
<P>The memorial of the committee of merchants again&s;t pa|per money, is charged as proof again&s;t the bank on that &s;ubject: but even &s;uppo&s;ing the whole committee of mer|chants to be &s;tockholders, the &s;tock they may re&s;pectively po&s;&s;e&s;s, does not exceed two, three, four or five &s;hares, amounting to 800, 1200, 1600, or 2000 dollars: and is this the great matter that could induce them to oppo&s;e paper money, if there were no other con&s;iderations? This inte|re&s;t in bank &s;tock is not permanent&mdash;but changeable: and their &s;hares, if they hold any, could only influence during the time they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them. But in common charity, the&s;e gentlemen ought to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;o re&s;pectable a &s;et of men have &s;ome other principle of conduct than merely &s;elf-intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The letter from the pre&s;ident of the bank, offering a loan of money to the &s;tate, to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of i&s;&s;uing paper money, is now become a charge al&s;o, again&s;t the in&s;ti|tution&mdash;becau&s;e it is an evidence of the directors being op|po&s;ed to paper money. Now, in my opinion, this letter proves their merit: they thought paper money would be injurious to the &s;tate; and therefore they offered to lend what was wanted, rather than it &s;hould &s;u&s;tain that in|jury.
<PB N="92" REF="019884_0095_0FAD41A79EF82960">
It may be &s;aid they offered to lend what was want|ed, rather than the bank &s;hould &s;u&s;tain the injury which paper money would do it. Agreed: the intere&s;t of the &s;tate and of the bank are the &s;ame in this, as they are in all other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ers of the bank, we are told, have no private in|tere&s;t to &s;erve by their oppo&s;ition. But &s;o long as they re|gard the bank and its &s;upporters as one party, and them&s;elves as another, they are as much intere&s;ted in the que&s;tion as their opponents. In fact, we have all one common intere&s;t in the welfare of our country: and although the defenders of the bank may have a &s;mall and &s;eparate intere&s;t in that in&s;titution, I am confident there is not one of us that would urge the re&s;toring of the charter, if we regarded it as in|compatible with the public welfare. The member from We&s;tmoreland a&s;ks, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the gentlemen on his &s;ide of the que&s;tion would oppo&s;e the bank from mere motives of envy? I believe that if they had been left fairly to them&s;elves, they would not have oppo&s;ed it at all&mdash;or at lea&s;t that they would not now oppo&s;e it: but there are others at the bottom of this oppo&s;ition&mdash;people who feel a politi|cal intere&s;t in the matter, who&s;e &s;u&s;picions have been rou&s;ed, by the dread of phantoms pre&s;ented to their imagination through the medium of envy and jealou&s;y. I could &s;peak plainer&mdash;but it is unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This &s;ame gentleman draws a curious conclu&s;ion, from my having, as he &s;tates it, formed an expectation that the jud|ges, however oppo&s;ed individually to the bank, would in the courts decide in its favour. His conclu&s;ion is, that I depend on bank influence to obtain &s;uch a deci&s;ion. But the que&s;|tion to be decided in the courts, is not whether the bank is u&s;eful or injurious? It is, whether a charter once granted, can be annulled without proof or even pretence of forfeiture? This is a general que&s;tion, affecting all corporations: and however &s;ome of the judges might be inclined to op|po&s;e the bank, I &s;till re&s;t &s;atisfied in my opinion of the in|tegrity of their deci&s;ion, and in my belief that they will be too regardful of their law characters, which become an ob|ject for hi&s;tory, ever to &s;ubject the judgment &s;eat to re|proach.</P>
<P>In reply to my ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting the difficulty of &s;el|ling inward and purcha&s;ing outward cargoes for &s;hipping, he a&s;ks, how were our &s;hips loaded before the revolution? I an&s;wer, and the fact is well known, that delays frequently, I
<PB N="93" REF="019884_0096_0FAD41A8F53B1340">
may &s;ay con&s;tantly occurred for want of facilities in rai&s;ing money, and the merchant had it not always in his power to purcha&s;e the produce brought to market by the farmer. The bank has remedied this inconvenience to both: de&s;troy the bank, and I have no doubt the ca&s;e will again become fami|liar to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable traders.</P>
<P>He has ob&s;erved that this is the only &s;tate <HI>&s;addled</HI> with a bank, altho' attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h them have not been wanting at Bo&s;ton, New York and Baltimore. But this ob&s;ervation will not &s;erve the gentleman. At Bo&s;ton they have an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed bank, countenanced and incorporated by the govern|ment. At New-York they have a bank; a charter has not been obtained&mdash;but I have been informed that it was withheld, when applied for, only becau&s;e the per&s;ons applying for it, were obnoxious to government. The attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h a bank at Baltimore, failed for want of &s;ub&s;criptions to a &s;uffi|cient amount of capital, and not for want of a charter. However, if the bank in this city be de&s;troyed, I venture to pronounce, that banks will &s;oon be e&s;tabli&s;hed both in New-York and Baltimore: and our mea&s;ures will give great advan|tage to tho&s;e places, which are u&s;ually con&s;idered as our dangerous rivals.</P>
<P>I might follow this gentleman's ob&s;ervations &s;till further; but not having, on account of his ab&s;ence, been much u&s;ed to his voice of late, and from his &s;peaking rather low at times, I found difficulty in taking notes of all he &s;aid. I wi&s;h, however, that he had addre&s;&s;ed our under&s;tanding, by &s;peak|ing to facts&mdash;in&s;tead of appealing to our feelings, by argu|ments drawn from what he calls the nature of things. In this he has &s;hewn more addre&s;s and judgment than candour.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering what has fallen from the member from Mont|gomery county [mr. Lollar] this morning, as a kind of apo|logy for what he &s;aid on the fir&s;t day, I &s;hall pa&s;s it over without remark, and proceed to make &s;ome general ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The report of the committee of la&s;t year contains matter of opinion only, and of opinions un&s;upported by fact. The bank is &s;aid to be of no u&s;e to the farmer: I beg leave to a&s;k, whether it is not u&s;eful to the farmer to meet a ready &s;ale for his produce? If it be, I in&s;i&s;t that the bank, in its operations, is u&s;eful to the farmer. I have heretofore expe|rienced the inconvenience ari&s;ing from the want of a bank. When produce has been in plenty at market, and I been ea|gerly bent on the purcha&s;e of it, although po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of pro|perty
<PB N="94" REF="019884_0097_0FAD41A94D3C90A8">
&s;ufficient, I could not command money for the pur|po&s;e; and the farmer could not &s;ell upon credit: thus both have &s;uffered di&s;tre&s;s, which would have been relieved by a bank. The exports in tho&s;e days were very con&s;iderable:&mdash;the hou&s;e of which I was then a member, have &s;hipped in one year from forty to fifty thou&s;and barrels of flour, and other articles in proportion. Such purcha&s;es required large &s;ums of money: and the&s;e were extremely difficult to rai&s;e.</P>
<P>The quantity of produce for exportation, will now be in|crea&s;ed every year: and the demand for money will al&s;o in|crea&s;e. If the bank be de&s;troyed, the merchants of the&s;e days, will experience the difficulties I have mentioned. The farmers and millers bringing their produce to market, mu&s;t wait for the &s;ale, until money can be rai&s;ed. They will be frequently compelled to &s;ell at reduced prices, &s;uch as a chance monied man may plea&s;e to offer: or they mu&s;t place their goods in the hands of factors, who mu&s;t derive their advantage by way of commi&s;&s;ion, &s;torage, and charges, all which the farmer mu&s;t pay. Whereas, if a bank is &s;uffered to exi&s;t in full force, the merchant's occa&s;ional nece&s;&s;ities can be relieved by di&s;counts, and the farmer meet with ready &s;ale for his produce. This I conceive to be the greate&s;t u&s;e the farmers can wi&s;h to derive from the bank.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attack on the bank, gave a check to the price of produce, which has continued to be felt ever &s;ince: and if the bank be de&s;troyed, tho&s;e farmers who rai&s;e more than they con&s;ume, will become &s;en&s;ible of the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The bank, we are told, not only does not lend to the far|mers&mdash;but prevents their getting money on loan. This I de|ny. Millers and farmers of re&s;pon&s;ibility, if they have con|nections in the city to indor&s;e their notes, can procure di&s;|counts at the bank, as readily as the citizens of Philadelphia. In order to con&s;ider properly the charge that the bank pre|vents people from lending their money on bond and mort|gage, which they &s;ay it effects, by the enormous dividends drawn upon bank &s;tock, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the amount of that &s;tock, and to whom it belongs:&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;tock at pre&s;ent amounts to 870,400 dollars, which, divided by 400, gives 2176 &s;hares, whereof 285 &s;hares be|long to foreigners, of which nine tenths to Holland. None of the money inve&s;ted in the&s;e &s;hares, would, if there was no bank, be lent in this &s;tate upon bond and mortgage, we may &s;afely conclude. Various have been the applications made by our citizens to borrow money in Europe, particu|larly
<PB N="95" REF="019884_0098_0FAD41AA0F1A2278">
in Holland: and altho' the be&s;t landed &s;ecurity which this country affords, has been offered, yet every application has failed; and not a &s;ingle &s;hilling has been obtained that I could ever learn. Six hundred and &s;ix &s;hares belong to inhabi|tants of New Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Connecticut, New York, New Jer&s;ey, Delaware, and Virginia: a con&s;iderable part of the&s;e &s;hares were &s;ub&s;cribed during the war, by per|&s;ons &s;timulated thereto by the belief that placing a part of their funds in the bank of North America, would afford a great aid to the cau&s;e of the united &s;tates. The&s;e &s;hares are divided among many individuals: can it, therefore, be be|lieved, that any part of the money paid for the&s;e &s;hares, would, upon a di&s;&s;olution of the bank, be lent upon bond and mortgage to our citizens? If tho&s;e &s;tockholders were di&s;|po&s;ed to lend in that manner, it would, doubtle&s;s, be in their own re&s;pective &s;tates, to their own fellow-citizens, within their own view, and within the protection of tho&s;e laws under which they live.&mdash;Six &s;hares are held by inhabitants of Che&s;|ter county, one by an inhabitant of Lanca&s;ter, five by inha|bitants of We&s;tmoreland, twelve by inhabitants of Berks, twelve by inhabitants of Bucks, and fourteen by inhabitants of Philadelphia county. The&s;e fifty &s;hares were probably &s;ub&s;cribed on the &s;ame patriotic principles: and, if the bank were de&s;troyed, it is po&s;&s;ible that this money, or &s;ome part of it, might be lent upon bond and mortgage. But the whole amount of fifty &s;hares is only 20,000 dollars: and it is doubt|ful whether any part of even this pittance would <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> lent out. The remaining &s;hares, being 1235, belong to citizens of Philadelphia, and principally to the commercial men, who&s;e greate&s;t inducement to continue &s;tockholders, is to &s;upport an in&s;titution which affords them accommodation and convenience, by means of di&s;counts. With a very few exceptions, we may &s;ay that not one dollar of this money, would ever be lent out on bond and mortgage. There are very few if any of this cla&s;s of &s;tockholders who do not &s;tand in need of the whole of their money in the cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s: and when in need, they bor|row occa&s;ionally perhaps the whole amount, or more: It is upon the&s;e principles, the merchants generally re|main &s;tockholders&mdash;when one does not want his money, it is earning his &s;hare of the dividend from another: and by thus clubbing a capital together, as it were, the occa|&s;ional wants of all are &s;upplied. But I am perfectly &s;atisfied,
<PB N="96" REF="019884_0099_0FAD3E3F777DFE60">
that none of the money paid for the&s;e &s;hares, can be lent on bond and mortgage. Does it not, therefore, appear that this charge is as groundle&s;s as the others?</P>
<P>Before the war, monied men were fond of lending upon bond and mortgage: it was a favourite practice; was thought perfectly &s;afe; and enabled tho&s;e who were advanced in years, to receive an income, &s;o as to live at ea&s;e and quiet; and I doubt not this practice might have been revived, had not mo&s;t of tho&s;e lenders &s;uffered &s;everely&mdash;&s;ome in the whole&mdash;and others in part&punc; and even tho&s;e who have e&s;caped lo&s;s, are deterred from lending again by the dread of paper mo|ney and tender laws; and &s;o long as this dread continues, all hopes mu&s;t be relinqui&s;hed, of borrowing upon bond and mortgage.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the practice of lending upon bond and mortgage exi&s;ted, there was another practice exi&s;ted with it. The lenders were chiefly citizens; and for the convenience of col|lecting the intere&s;t on the day it fell due, they preferred lending to tho&s;e citizens of Philadelphia, who wanted to borrow; &s;o that the farmers, even in tho&s;e days, could not obtain loans, until the citizens were &s;atisfied; now, &s;hould the days of loaning return, the bank will prove u&s;eful to the country in that re&s;pect; for by the temporary di&s;counts which citizens obtain at the bank, it is probable that mo&s;t of their wants may be &s;upplied, and thereby their competitions with the farmers be prevented. I have known many a man formerly obliged to borrow money for twelve months, al|though he only wanted it for three, four or &s;ix; but the practice was to lend for twelve; and the capitali&s;ts thought it too trouble&s;ome to lend for a &s;horter time. A certain rich citizen of Philadelphia, inimical to the bank, now taken and hugged to the bo&s;oms of tho&s;e gentlemen who &s;o warmly advocate the intere&s;t of the farmers, declares publicly, that he is an enemy to the in&s;titution becau&s;e he could purcha&s;e flour cheaper, were it de&s;troyed, From this declaration, the farmers may form &s;ome judgment how far the bank is u&s;ele&s;s or injurious to them.</P>
<P>In effect, the utility of the bank is experienced by every man in the &s;tate, at &s;ome period or other. I have &s;hewn clearly it is u&s;eful to the farmer and miller. The mechanic derives al&s;o his &s;hare of benefit and convenience from this in&s;titution. Punctuality in paying his workmen is of great advantage to the ma&s;ter, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the com|fortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the journeymen. The employer mu&s;t
<PB N="97" REF="019884_0100_0FAD3E406A9C3018">
have it in his power to make regular payments to the ma&s;ter mechanic,&mdash;or he, in his turn, cannot be punctual. It has heretofore happened, that tho&s;e who built hou&s;es, or gave employment to various trades, have not had it in their power to pay punctually, according to their engagements. The like may be expected again. But in all &s;uch ca&s;es, on fu|ture occa&s;ions, relief may be found at the bank. The em|ployer, giving his note to the ma&s;ter, their joint credit, if they are entitled to credit, will procure the &s;um wanted, by di&s;count at the bank. This ob&s;ervation mu&s;t &s;trike every mechanic at the fir&s;t glance; and, if he turns his attention to the &s;ubject, his own thoughts will point out various modes by which he may draw re&s;ources and conveniences from this in&s;titution. In &s;hort, the &s;ame rea&s;oning will apply to every de&s;cription of men that have any thing to do with money.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, then, that we &s;hall pur&s;ue mea&s;ures for the de&s;truction of an in&s;titution &s;o u&s;eful? One would think that the fir&s;t thing which offers it&s;elf to our con&s;ideration, on the nature of a bank, would be &s;ufficient to prevent the pur&s;uit of &s;uch a mea&s;ure. It is, that a number of per&s;ons have placed in the care of the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank a &s;um of money for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of lending to tho&s;e that want to borrow; and this &s;um tho&s;e per&s;ons (&s;tockholders) cannot draw out again; but it mu&s;t remain for that u&s;e. Be&s;ides this, there is al&s;o a further &s;um con|&s;tantly in the power of the directors, which enables them to extend their loans beyond the capital or &s;tock; and on which part of the profits of the bank ari&s;e. The integrity, punctuality and prudence of the pre&s;ident and directors have obtained &s;uch credit with the citizens of Philadelphia, that numbers of them depo&s;it their money in bank for &s;afety and convenience. It is received and paid at their plea&s;ure, with|out expence or ri&s;que to the depo&s;itor. And the &s;ums &s;o collected to a point, being con&s;iderable, the bank is enabled always to lend a part of the money &s;o placed: as it is not in the nature of things that the depo&s;itors &s;hould all call for their money at one and the &s;ame time&mdash;con&s;equently, a part of the &s;um will an&s;wer the demands of the whole; and by this means, it mu&s;t be &s;een, that &s;ums of money are con|&s;tantly brought into circulation and u&s;e, that would other|wi&s;e lie mouldering in the che&s;ts of tho&s;e who would neither lend nor u&s;e them; and that the bank, by this credit, is en|abled to extend its utility among&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities,
<PB N="98" REF="019884_0101_0FAD3E4107479238">
di&s;appointments, intere&s;t, or convenience, incline them to borrow.</P>
<P>I have been frequently told, out of doors, although it has not been mentioned here&mdash;indeed it could not with pro|priety be mentioned here&mdash;that the oppo&s;ition to the bank is in part levelled at me per&s;onally. If any oppo&s;e it in that view, and &s;uppo&s;e that my intere&s;t would &s;uffer by the anni|hilation of the bank, they are gro&s;sly mi&s;taken. I am not &s;timulated by the con&s;ideration of private intere&s;t, to &s;tand forth in defence of the bank: for be a&s;&s;ured, &s;ir, that if this, be de&s;troyed, another &s;hall ari&s;e out of its a&s;hes&mdash;one that will be of great advantage to my intere&s;t, and to the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who may join me in the e&s;tabli&s;hing it: nay, &s;hould I be di&s;appointed in procuring &s;uch a&s;&s;ociates as I would choo&s;e in the undertaking, I will e&s;tabli&s;h a bank on my own capital, credit, and re&s;ources; and &s;o far from doubting its &s;ucce&s;s, I do not he&s;itate to pronounce that even my ene|mies (and God knows I &s;eem to have enough of them&mdash;at lea&s;t political enemies&mdash;for I know of no other cau&s;e for them being &s;o)&mdash;will deal with and tru&s;t me; not that I expect they may like me better then than now; but they have con|fidence in me; and, for the &s;ake of their own intere&s;t and convenience, they will deal with me.</P>
<P>The gentleman from We&s;tmoreland has acknowledged the utility of the bank during the war; and has drawn a com|pari&s;on between it and the continental army. The conti|nental army, &s;ays, he, were u&s;eful during the war: and yet we di&s;banded them. But &s;urely they were not di&s;banded be|cau&s;e they had been u&s;eful&mdash;but becau&s;e, when peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed, they were no longer nece&s;&s;ary. He acknowledg|es that this in&s;titution was u&s;eful; and yet endeavours to aboli&s;h it&mdash;becau&s;e it has been &s;aid that it was injurious.</P>
<P>He al&s;o made a compari&s;on between the bank and general Wa&s;hington. I have ever acknowledged the &s;ervices and me|rits of that great man. His utility during the war will ne|ver be denied: and in his re&s;ignation, he acted con&s;i&s;tently with that noble and di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pirit by which he had been actuated during his command. He did what was expected of him: and it will ever be a part of my pride to join in paying him every tribute of prai&s;e. But this compari&s;on ought not to have been made; the general's acceptance of command, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank, are very different things; and took place on very different principles. The fir&s;t was the patriotic act of a noble mind, which had not only the
<PB N="99" REF="019884_0102_0FAD3E41D91E82F0">
&s;ervice of his country, but al&s;o honour and glory in view. The la&s;t aro&s;e from nece&s;&s;ity, having al&s;o the &s;ervice of the country for one part of its object, and the intere&s;t and emolument of tho&s;e who &s;hould engage in it, for the other. The country has received the &s;ervice: and now endeavours are u&s;ed to requite it with ingratitude. But further &s;er|vices and benefits may be expected by America from this bank. We are now at war with the Algerines. Every one knows that peace mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed of them with arms or with money. In either ca&s;e, money is nece&s;&s;ary: and we know that the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing requi&s;itions of congre&s;s, do not prevail with the &s;tates to rai&s;e it as fa&s;t as they ought: nay, whil&s;t the &s;everal &s;tates are deliberating whether or how they &s;hall rai&s;e money, one part of the citizens of the united &s;tates are plundered of their property by the &s;eizure of their &s;hips and cargoes; and another part of them are condemned to &s;lavery. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the commi&s;&s;ioners employ|ed for the purpo&s;e, had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that the Algerines had agreed to make peace, on the receipt of a &s;um of money&mdash;where &s;hall congre&s;s get the money? We have not &s;o well enabled them to acquit their engagements in Europe, as to afford any rea&s;onable pro&s;pect that they can borrow more. But upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, this in&s;titution&mdash;the bank&mdash;might again be of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the united &s;tates. In this &s;tate, we are now threatened with internal troubles at Wioming: no per&s;on can tell what may happen in that quar|ter: if things go on as they have done, we may be in want of every aid Where are we to find &s;udden re&s;ources, or the &s;ums that may become nece&s;&s;ary to put an end to tho&s;e troubles, and extend the protection of government over the boundaries of the &s;tate? Various circum&s;tances tend to &s;hew, that upon this and every proper occa&s;ion, the government of Penn&s;ylvania might be &s;ure to command every aid and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance which the bank can give: And &s;hall we then, from a mere pretended opinion that this in&s;titution has been injuri|ous, "rip up the goo&s;e that lays the golden eggs?"</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie &s;aid the gentleman had a&s;&s;umed another ground. The debate had, until that &s;tage, been conducted with de|cency&mdash;how far he [mr. Morris] had departed therefrom, he left tho&s;e pre&s;ent to judge. The members oppo&s;ed to the bank were by him charged directly with &s;peculating in the depreciation of the paper money&mdash;and indirectly with perju|ry. He might be under the nece&s;&s;ity of recriminating. If he &s;hould be obliged to touch upon any circum&s;tances of that
<PB N="100" REF="019884_0103_0FAD3E428A24C570">
gentleman's private conduct, he hoped he would bear it pa|tiently.</P>
<P>Ordered, that the further con&s;ideration of the report be po&s;tponed.</P>

<P>RESUMED the con&s;ideration of the report of the committee, to whom were referred the memorials pray|ing a repeal or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the law annulling the charter of the bank.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitz&s;imons. After the able di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which this &s;ub|ject has undergone, little &s;eems to be left for me to &s;ay. My worthy colleague, who&s;e knowledge and experience are &s;o &s;uperior to mine, has gone largely into it: but as appeals have been made by our opponents to the feelings of the far|mer and the trade&s;man&mdash;and as he has left &s;ome points un|touched&mdash;I mu&s;t pray the attention of the hou&s;e, while I endeavour to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on them.</P>
<P>If there appears to have been any attempt at rea&s;oning, by tho&s;e who are oppo&s;ed to the re&s;olution, it has been by the member from We&s;tmoreland. That gentleman has the capacity of &s;tating clearly, and rea&s;oning ju&s;tly. If he has failed in either, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, it mu&s;t be imputed rather to the badne&s;s of the cau&s;e he has undertaken, than to the want of ability in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To his reflections upon government, I &s;hall make little re|ply. If our habits and our circum&s;tances are not well adapt|ed to our frame of government, it is the fault of tho&s;e who made it: for our habits and our circum&s;tances were nearly the &s;ame as they are at pre&s;ent, when the con&s;titution was formed.</P>
<P>His ob&s;ervations upon trade, being drawn from theory, it would be improper to remark &s;everely on them: but it may not be unu&s;eful to &s;hew they are not well grounded.</P>
<P>His arguments went to prove, that our imports exceeding our exports to a very great amount, mu&s;t prove injurious&mdash;in &s;hort, they went to prove, that our trade, as it is at pre|&s;ent, ought not to be encouraged. But the&s;e opinions, as well as &s;ome others that have been advanced in the cour&s;e of this debate, have been taken upon tru&s;t: and though they may corre&s;pond very well with the &s;ituation of We&s;tmore|land county, and &s;ome others which are not within reach of
<PB N="101" REF="019884_0104_0FAD3E43462E4A68">
a &s;eaport to di&s;po&s;e of their products&mdash;it will be difficult to per&s;uade tho&s;e farmers who have been accu&s;tomed to bring the produce of their indu&s;try to this city, and receive mo|ney for it, that trade is injurious. I believe experience has fully proved the contrary; and that the commerce of Penn|&s;ylvania has been eminently u&s;eful in promoting and encou|raging its agriculture and improvements.</P>
<P>As to the trade of import, which the gentleman conceives to operate &s;o forcibly to our ruin, I do not wonder he &s;hould not be well informed re&s;pecting it: as I find many hold that opinion, who have better means of information. Immediate|ly after the peace took place, the importations were very great. The people in Europe &s;eem to have con&s;idered Phi|ladelphia as the emporium of America; and directed their operations to it accordingly: but does that gentleman know what part of tho&s;e importations was again exported? Does he know that we have u&s;ually imported for the con&s;umption of We&s;t Jer&s;ey, Delaware, the Ea&s;tern Shore of Maryland&mdash;and that almo&s;t every &s;tate in the union derived &s;upplies of European goods from us&mdash;after tho&s;e great importations were made&mdash;and that this &s;tate derived a very con&s;iderable revenue upon their con&s;umption? An impo&s;t of 100,000l. per annum, paid into the trea&s;ury, ought to convince the gentleman, that trade even to him is not unu&s;eful&mdash;he has a &s;hare of that revenue.</P>
<P>Am&s;terdam imports from all parts of the globe, and to an immen&s;e amount. Are the United Netherlands, or the pro|vince of Holland, ruined by tho&s;e importations?&mdash;or are they not rather the &s;ource of their wealth? That city pays two-fifths of all the expences of the &s;tates; Philadelphia has paid in nearly the &s;ame proportion, of all the expences of Penn&s;ylvania. Philadelphia was likely to become the Am|&s;terdam of America: but the gentlemen from Fayette, We&s;t|moreland, &amp;c. being &s;uch adepts in the &s;cience of commerce, have taken effectual mea&s;ures to prevent it.</P>
<P>In the gentleman's ob&s;ervations upon commerce, he had almo&s;t forgotten our exports&mdash;"a little flax&s;eed,"&mdash;but not worth mentioning.</P>
<P>There have been &s;hipped from this port 14,000 hog&s;|heads of tobacco, in a year, at 3l. per hhd. worth 42,000l. exclu&s;ive of freight; 40,000 barrels of flour; 300,000 bu&s;hels of wheat; with a variety of other articles: which are &s;urely of &s;ome value.</P>
<P>We were not only the importers for other &s;tates, but the
<PB N="102" REF="019884_0105_0FAD3E44051A9460">
exporters likewi&s;e. In the year 1784, 12,000 hog&s;heads to|bacco, the produce of Virginia and Maryland, were &s;hipped from this port. It appears by the returns from the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, that 1116 &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els entered and cleared at it la&s;t year: the value of the cargoes of &s;uch a number, mu&s;t &s;urely be of &s;ome con&s;equence. But whatever may have been the advantages of this commerce, I repeat it&mdash;our own unwi&s;e re&s;trictions will operate to le&s;&s;en them.</P>
<P>That the extent of our importations has been injurious to the &s;tate, is become a fa&s;hionable doctrine: it is propagated to &s;erve &s;ome purpo&s;e, and has obtained credit: but how does this appear? The value of our imports may be pretty accurately known, by the books of the collector: but the proportion of them &s;old to the &s;tates around us, which go by land, or by inland navigation, cannot be a&s;certained. The exportation of &s;pecie is the proof principally relied on, and from thence the ruin of the &s;tate is predicted. For my own part, I &s;ee money exported with as little reluctance as I &s;ee any other merchandize&mdash;I con&s;ider it but as a merchandize,&mdash;and that if we export it at one time, we &s;hall import it at another. I wonder how we obtained this money&mdash;Penn&s;ylva|nia has neither gold or &s;ilver mines&mdash;but &s;he has what is bet|ter, and what will purcha&s;e gold and &s;ilver at all times. This complaint, however, of the export of &s;pecie, does not come well from the advocates of paper money. I think a very com|mon a&s;&s;ertion of theirs, is&mdash;that a virtuous people can live without gold or &s;ilver: and they would all wi&s;h to be thought virtuous.</P>
<P>It appears to me a little paradoxical, that an importation of an over proportion of goods can be injurious to a country. It does not follow, that becau&s;e the merchants import more goods than are nece&s;&s;ary, that the people &s;hould buy more than they want. It may po&s;&s;ibly oblige the importer (as has been the ca&s;e in many in&s;tances) to &s;ell them for le&s;s than co&s;t: but &s;urely the lo&s;s there mu&s;t be to the &s;eller, and not to the buyer: and as the &s;ellers on tho&s;e terms, have been ge|nerally foreigners, the lo&s;s has been theirs, and the gain been ours. It may have been a temptation to unthinking people to buy more than they had occa&s;ion for&mdash;and our merchants have &s;uffered in the &s;ale of &s;uch goods as they had on hand, which mu&s;t have been cau&s;ed by the low price of the others: but it is a novel complaint, that a choice of goods, to be bought at le&s;s than their co&s;t, &s;hould be an injury to the purcha&s;er.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="019884_0106_0FAD3E4532E9F368">
To complain of the want of money, is not peculiar to the pre&s;ent times. Such complaints always have, and always will be made. I think the average price of flour, during the la&s;t year, would be near 50s. for the barrel (1cwt. 3qrs.); of wheat, 9s. per bu&s;hel; of flax&s;eed, 15s. per bu&s;hel; and im|mediate &s;ale, and payment on delivery. This, &s;urely, did not argue a want of money. Was there any part of the produce of the country brought to market, that could not be &s;old for ready money, and at a very high price? I believe not.</P>
<P>I am ready, however, to acknowledge that this is not the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. The produce of the country has fallen in price: and, what is wor&s;e, there are not purcha&s;ers for it, at any price. If I were to a&s;&s;ert that this is owing in part to a &s;toppage of di&s;count at the bank, perhaps it would be con|troverted&mdash;I leave tho&s;e that would controvert it, to account for it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus much I have thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay upon the &s;ub|ject of commerce, that the po&s;itions laid down by the gentle|man from We&s;tmoreland, might not be taken for granted.</P>
<P>As he was obliged to acknowledge that the bank was u&s;eful to commerce, he meant to &s;hew that commerce was injurious to the &s;tate; and of cour&s;e, that the bank, which gave faci|lity to that commerce, was nece&s;&s;arily injurious.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ubject of the bank, I have yet &s;aid very little: my worthy colleague has explained its u&s;efulne&s;s very fully. From the arguments u&s;ed again&s;t it, we would be led to in|fer, that the money locked up in its vaults, is u&s;ele&s;s to the good people of the &s;tate; and that if it were not for &s;uch an in&s;titution, the whole of that money would be lent out on bond or mortgage in the country. Let us examine if this is really the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>If this money was not in the bank, would it nece&s;&s;arily be lent out in the country? Or, being in the bank, is it there|fore unemployed? It is ea&s;y to prove that neither of the&s;e is the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the pre&s;ent &s;tock of the bank, 360,000 dollars are the property of per&s;ons who are not inhabitants of, or re&s;ident in Penn&s;ylvania: and I believe it will not be pretended that the owners of that part of the &s;tock would &s;end it to Penn|&s;ylvania, to be lent out at intere&s;t. There is yet no in&s;tance of foreigners lending money in this &s;tate on private &s;ecurity. And &s;uch of the &s;tockholders as are citizens of the &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, would not be likely to &s;end it here for that purpo&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e the rate of intere&s;t is as high, at lea&s;t, in the other
<PB N="104" REF="019884_0107_0FAD3E459C5A9B20">
&s;tates as in Penn&s;ylvania&mdash;and there is as good &s;ecurity there. Of the remaining &s;tock, near 500,000 dollars are the pro|perty of people in and near the city, divided among about two hundred and fifty per&s;ons: mo&s;t of tho&s;e are in bu&s;ine&s;s, and became &s;tockholders to encourage the in&s;titution, be|cau&s;e it operates to their convenience, and becau&s;e they can borrow not only as much as they own of the &s;tock, but much more, according to their credit and circum&s;tances.&mdash;Very few of them, however, could put their money out to intere&s;t. Few of the merchants of the pre&s;ent day, have mo|ney beyond their immediate occa&s;ions: if this is the ca&s;e&mdash;and I believe it cannot be di&s;proved&mdash;very little, if any of the pre&s;ent capital would be lent out in the country at inte|re&s;t, though there had never been a bank.</P>
<P>But does it follow that the money's being in the bank ren|ders it le&s;s u&s;eful to the citizens? Surely it does not. The dividends made to the &s;tockholders prove that it is all em|ployed: and whatever the dividend exceeds the common in|tere&s;t of money, proves that more is circulated than its &s;tock: of cour&s;e, &s;o much is added to the circulation beyond the ac|tual &s;pecie.</P>
<P>There can be no method by which the circulation is better a&s;&s;i&s;ted than by a bank of depo&s;it and di&s;count, &s;uch as the bank of North America is. Among trading people, where there are no banks, every merchant or trader mu&s;t at all times have money in his che&s;t or in his drawer unemployed: if a man is in the receipt of money, he cannot lay it out again the day he receives it. If he wants to make a purcha&s;e of any con&s;iderable value, he collects money for &s;ome time in order to enable him to make that purcha&s;e; or, if he has bought on credit, he collects to make good his payment when it becomes due: by this means it mu&s;t happen, that a con&s;iderable part of the money u&s;ed in that place, mu&s;t every day be ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s. But where there is a bank, a trader, when he receives money, &s;ends it there, for the&s;e rea&s;ons&mdash;that it is kept in &s;afety, without any expence; that the more he keeps there, the better credit he has; and that if he occa&s;ionally borrows, his making depo&s;its of money is an inducement to the directors to lend to him. By keeping the money there, the whole &s;um, which would have lain in the hands of the different owners, is collected together: and as all the owners never want their money on the &s;ame day, the bank is enabled to lend for &s;hort periods a certain part of that money; and thereby give that part circulation, which
<PB N="105" REF="019884_0108_0FAD4039C7EC7140">
would otherwi&s;e be u&s;ele&s;s. Thus it appears that collecting money in a bank, increa&s;es the circulation: and the utmo&s;t that the country gentlemen can any ways contend for, is&mdash;that they, living at a di&s;tance, and wi&s;hing to be accommo|dated with loans of money for long periods, cannot have them at the bank. But is that a rea&s;on that the inhabitants of the city and its vicinity &s;hall not have the privilege of accommodating each other? Though the money is not lent to the farmer, yet, as it facilitates the purcha&s;e of his pro|ducts, and the procuring him ready money for them, he de|rives thereby a full &s;hare of the advantage.</P>
<P>Another objection has been artfully made to the opera|tions of the bank, which de&s;erves notice: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the aid it gives the merchant, enables him to keep up his goods till he can obtain a better price for them, than if they were to be immediately &s;old. This objection is more plau&s;ible than &s;o|lid. It is in the nature of trade, that when it is free, the pro|fit is &s;oon reduced as low as the trade will admit: it mu&s;t afford &s;ufficient for the encouragement of tho&s;e concerned in it, or they will leave it off: if it exceeds that proportion, for any time, &s;o many will engage in it, as to reduce the profit.</P>
<P>If, when a &s;hip arrives, the merchant can, by a loan of money from the bank, di&s;patch her again immediately, &s;he performs, perhaps, two voyages more in the year, than if he is obliged to detain her till the cargo is &s;old: and this will certainly enable him to &s;ell his goods cheaper, or to give more for the products of the country. A moderate capital, &s;uch as ours generally are, turned four times a year, will en|able the merchant to &s;ell for a le&s;s profit than if he turns it but twice. So that in every view in which this in&s;titution is taken, it will be found advantageous.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the liberality of its management, the in|&s;tances are innumerable. When the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate were unable to pay the officers of their army, they granted them certificates; and mortgaged the revenue of the exci&s;e for payment of the intere&s;t. When the intere&s;t became due, the revenue was not collected: and the di&s;tre&s;s of the offi|cers was great. On that occa&s;ion, without any particular ap|plication, the bank advanced the money; and took the re|imbur&s;ement when the revenue was collected.</P>
<P>At the time when its aid to the united &s;tates had put it out of the directors' power to make private di&s;counts, they, up|on
<PB N="106" REF="019884_0109_0FAD403BB5AA8680">
an application of the legi&s;lature, advanced 5000l. for the defence of the frontiers.</P>
<P>I remember when the enemy's row boats took ve&s;&s;els with|in our port, and carried them off: and the &s;tate had not the means of granting protection again&s;t &s;o incon&s;iderable, tho' in&s;ulting an enemy. On that occa&s;ion, the bank, by an ad|vance of about 25,000l. enabled the merchants to &s;it out a &s;hip, which, within a few days, not only cleared the bay and river, but captured a cruizer of twenty guns, belonging to the Briti&s;h fleet.</P>
<P>The in&s;tances of its &s;ervices are innumerable. A&s;k the managers of the hou&s;e of employment: they will tell you the poor could not be fed without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the bank.&mdash;A&s;k the wardens of the city; and they will tell you that the city could not now be lighted but by means of the loans obtained there. But it is needle&s;s to repeat the in&s;tances: for I may &s;ay there is no &s;ervice, public or charitable, to which its a&s;&s;i&s;tance has been denied. Perhaps its u&s;e will be better under&s;tood when the want of it is &s;ufficiently felt&mdash;and though the pre&s;ent attempt to cru&s;h it may &s;ucceed for a time, I have no doubt it will be as eagerly called for as it is now decried.</P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving, that there are gentlemen in this hou&s;e, who &s;ometimes in&s;truct&mdash;but oftener in&s;ult us with their reading&mdash;One has brought us an extract from the jour|nals of the Iri&s;h commons, to prove that the people of Ire|land were oppo&s;ed to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a bank. Several writers have treated on the &s;ubject of banking&mdash;one, a wri|ter in great repute, Mr. Smith, who treated on the wealth of nations, &s;tates that the trade of Gla&s;gow was doubled in 15 years after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a bank there&mdash;and that improvements of every kind kept pace with that increa&s;e. Thus if banks were regarded as injurious in &s;ome places, they have been found beneficial in others.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie. This &s;ubject has been &s;o ably handled by the gentlemen who have &s;poken again&s;t the report under the con|&s;ideration of the hou&s;e, that it is not requi&s;ite to enter deeply into it. It is however nece&s;&s;ary to take notice of &s;ome remarks which have fallen from the gentlemen in favour of the report.</P>
<P>Great &s;tre&s;s is laid on one circum&s;tance, and a loud cla|mour rai&s;ed, becau&s;e the committee of la&s;t year did not go to the bank. But I would a&s;k, what enquiry &s;hould we have made at the bank? What information would have been af|forded
<PB N="107" REF="019884_0110_0FAD403CBB004F20">
us there? Would the directors have laid open their books to us? I remember well a que&s;tion put to the directors by the committee who made the report before us, were they willing to give information to the committee con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ecrecy of the in&s;titution? If the committee of la&s;t year had called, they would not have laid open their books. And if the committee had enquired how far the pre&s;ident and directors had abu&s;ed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, it would have been altogether u&s;ele&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary. This being the ca&s;e, the committee were perfectly right in not calling at a place where they could not obtain the intelligence requi|&s;ite. There was another rea&s;on: the bank not being under the control of government, the committee could not oblige them to lay before them a &s;tate of their accounts, or their books.</P>
<P>Some of the arguments on this que&s;tion have been &s;o much refined as to be above the comprehen&s;ion of us country people. A gentleman tells us, that the balance of trade is a mere &s;peculation. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am not much acquain|ted with trade&mdash;but I know there is &s;ome &s;uch thing as a ba|lance of trade&mdash;and that it is greatly again&s;t this country at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion of right in this hou&s;e to take away a char|ter, has been pretty well di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and it now &s;eems well under&s;tood. Two of the members on the other &s;ide have conceded the point. The others have not&mdash;but their argu|ments amount to that, when our &s;ituation is con&s;idered. As charters are granted by the a&s;&s;embly&mdash;they can be revoked no other way than by the a&s;&s;embly. They cannot be taken away by the courts of ju&s;tice, as they are given by the legi&s;|lature.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the bank is dangerous to the &s;tate, and in &s;upport of this, the plan of mortgaging to it the re|venues has been adduced. The gentleman who propo&s;ed this plan, replies, that he was not authori&s;ed by the direc|tors to make the propo&s;al to this hou&s;e. Another member who is one of the bank directors, tells us the &s;ame thing. But really I can hardly &s;tretch my credulity &s;o far, as to be|lieve that to be the ca&s;e. If it was, I do not &s;cruple to &s;ay, it was an in&s;ult to this hou&s;e, to propo&s;e to them the adop|tion of a mea&s;ure, to which if they had acceded, they would have left it in the power of the directors to laugh at them.</P>
<P>The gentlemen in favour of the pre&s;ent report, have ma|nife&s;ted
<PB N="108" REF="019884_0111_0FAD403CCA6748C8">
a violent degree of re&s;entment again&s;t the commit|tee of la&s;t year, who made the report relative to the bank&mdash;at the &s;ame time they &s;eem de&s;irous to keep clear of the late hou&s;e. But if the committee were wicked, the hou&s;e mu&s;t have been no le&s;s criminal&mdash;as they mu&s;t have been either ignorant, or equally wicked. The policy of this proceeding, is ea&s;ily &s;een. There were no hopes of changing the minds of the members of the committee of la&s;t year, now in this hou&s;e&mdash;therefore it was not judged nece&s;&s;ary to keep any mea&s;ures with them&mdash;but the late hou&s;e is treated with more lenity, in hopes that &s;ome of its members now here, might come over in favour of the bank. One gentleman [mr. Fitz&s;imons] wi&s;hes he could &s;eparate the committee from the hou&s;e, and make them per&s;onally re&s;pon&s;ible. Had he pro|po&s;ed to impeach them, he would have &s;hewn a more man|ly &s;pirit, and not a wor&s;e di&s;po&s;ition. But the committee as well as the hou&s;e of la&s;t year, are accountable only to their country, which will judge of their conduct.</P>
<P>A gentleman from the city, [mr. Morris] has called upon us to &s;hew abu&s;es in the conduct of the directors of the bank. I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one fact&mdash;which, however, I &s;hall not mention, unle&s;s I am urged to it.&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman has a&s;&s;erted, that the public creditors would have been better paid, had the paper not been &s;truck&mdash;if the impo&s;t duties had been collected. That they were not collected, was not the fault of the late hou&s;e&mdash;it aro&s;e from the mi&s;conduct of &s;ome of the officers who&s;e duty it was to collect them. But the la&s;t hou&s;e could not pay the public creditors without the paper money.</P>
<P>The gentleman mentions the endeavours of the directors of the bank to prevent u&s;ury. But here facts &s;tand in our way. Can any gentleman &s;ay that u&s;ury was not coeval with the bank? The five per cent. per month is too well known, and its effects too &s;en&s;ibly felt, to render it nece&s;&s;ary to do more than barely mention it. All this was unknown before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank.</P>
<P>He &s;eems to call in que&s;tion the under&s;tanding of the late committee and a&s;ks, were they able or willing to con&s;ider the &s;ubject of the bank in every point of view? As to ca|pability, I am not di&s;po&s;ed to contend with him on that head&mdash;I &s;hall readily admit him my &s;uperior. The gentle|man then gives us a high encomium on the &s;ervices of the bank during the late conte&s;t&mdash;and tells us of his having lodg|ed 4 or 5000 barrels of flour in the camp of general Wa&s;h|ington,
<PB N="109" REF="019884_0112_0FAD403D9185D700">
on its own account. But it is not to him nor to the bank we are indebted for our independence&mdash;I &s;hould be glad it was a&s;certained to whom we owe that event&mdash;there are &s;o many claimants, that it &s;hould be decided on. A cer|tain writer, a friend of that gentleman's, lays claim to a great &s;hare of it&mdash;I wi&s;h they would &s;ettle it between them.</P>
<P>The gentlemen in favour of the report have laboured hard to &s;hew the dreadful con&s;equences of meddling with pro|perty. But what right of property has been invaded by the repealing act? If it had, indeed, confi&s;cated the property of the &s;tockholders, and applied it to the u&s;e of the &s;tate, then there might be &s;ome foundation for &s;uch an argument. No &s;uch thing has been done or even attempted. The a&s;&s;em|bly only determined that the bank &s;hould not be held under their charter. Will any man &s;ay that property may not be applied to improper u&s;es? Suppo&s;e a man had a mind to employ his property in erecting magazines and laying by military &s;tores, has not the a&s;&s;embly a right to pa&s;s a law to prevent him?</P>
<P>The gentleman is exceedingly hurt at the repetition of pa|per money&mdash;in our &s;peeches. But the bank is as dear to him as the paper money is to us, and as frequently occurs in his &s;peeches. I have lately read a pamphlet on paper money&mdash;and all the writer &s;ays on the &s;ubject, is, what an old Ger|man told him a long time ago&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That paper was paper&mdash;and money was money. But if an unprincipled author, who lets out his pen for hire, had &s;o far relaxed in his la&s;t per|formance that his employers would not pay him for it&mdash;if he, in want of his food, in pa&s;&s;ing through the market, &s;hould find a five &s;hilling bill in his pocket, and, going to a tavern, procure for it his dinner, and a pot of beer, he would be apt then to cry out&mdash;This paper money, I find, after all, is victuals and drink to me.</P>
<P>The directors of the bank are cho&s;en by the &s;tockholders, who vote in proportion to their property. If we examine this mode, we &s;hall find it highly dangerous: as all is done by nine or ten men&mdash;&s;o that the bank will remain under the pre&s;ent directors, during their lives, which is a direct tyran|ny, they being the repre&s;entatives of a few men only.</P>
<P>A gentleman from the city [mr. R. Morris] thanked God that the bank is not under the control of government. At a former day he was of a different opinion&mdash;[Here mr. Smi|lie read two articles of the propo&s;als for forming the bank&mdash;&s;igned by Mr. Morris&mdash;wherein the clau&s;e &s;ubjecting the
<PB N="110" REF="019884_0113_0FAD403E60AC3A30">
accounts of the bank to the in&s;pection of the &s;uperintendent of finance, is prai&s;ed and &s;tyled excellent.]</P>
<P>It appears by the&s;e articles that he thought it an excellent part of the plan of the bank that it &s;hould be under the control not only of congre&s;s, but of the &s;tate&mdash;but it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that he, as &s;uperintendent of finance, was the per&s;on who had the control of it. So that at different times, he entertains different &s;entiments on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The gentleman tells us the &s;tate has not credit&mdash;that it is too powerful to have it. But if the &s;tate has not credit, how can it communicate credit to the bank? And if the bank has credit, why a&s;k it of this hou&s;e?</P>
<P>I now refer to one of the notes I took while this gentle|man was &s;peaking ye&s;terday. He tells us that the members in favour of paper money, &s;eek it, for the purpo&s;e of pay|ing off debts at an under value&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. I did not make the charge the gentleman &s;ays, only again&s;t the members in favour of paper money, but I meant to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the advocates of it in general. I de|&s;ire that my words may be taken in their true &s;en&s;e. This charge has not originated with me&mdash;It has been made from one end of the continent to the other&mdash;in news papers, in public debates&mdash;and in private conver&s;ation&mdash;&s;o that it is no new thing.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie on this declared him&s;elf &s;atisfied with the ex|planation given by mr. Morris&mdash;and &s;aid he &s;hould not pur|&s;ue the cour&s;e he had propo&s;ed to him&s;elf in his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Morris declared it was not his wi&s;h or de&s;ire to pre|vent the member from taking the fulle&s;t latitude. He had a fair opportunity. Mr. Morris added he had not ri&s;en with a view to hinder it.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie. The gentleman made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the members from the country &s;peculating in lands and re|ceiving &s;o much per cent. for what bu&s;ine&s;s they tran&s;act&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Morris &s;aid a note had ju&s;t been put into his hand, &s;tating that a member then in the hou&s;e would, if called up|on, prove what he &s;aid relative to &s;ome of the members re|ceiving &s;o much per cent for tran&s;acting their neighbours bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie. What other members may do, I know not&mdash;but I have tran&s;acted a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s for my neigh|bours, and have never received a copper for it. I do not know that it would be criminal to receive payment&mdash;nor do
<PB N="111" REF="019884_0114_0FAD403F16F774A0">
I know who the gentleman means to charge. This informa|tion I regard as addre&s;&s;ed to the galleries.</P>
<P>It is denied that the bank facilitates commerce. But I think it is evident that it does. Cargoes of goods have been purcha&s;ed in one day, which could not have been the ca&s;e but for the bank. The bank, making it convenient to get money, facilitates the purcha&s;e of goods. It will not be con|troverted that goods are purcha&s;ed quicker by its means, than they po&s;&s;ibly could without it.</P>
<P>We are told that the friends of the bank have given &s;up|port and countenance to the paper money. I do not pretend to a&s;&s;ert the contrary. But I have heard it &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted. A gentleman &s;ays that a di&s;count on the paper money of from 2&frac12; to 5 per cent may be had. If &s;uch depreciation has ta|ken place, it is occa&s;ioned by the bank; as it does not re|ceive the paper money: and con&s;equently per&s;ons indebted to that in&s;titution are obliged to procure hard money at all events&mdash;&s;o that the bank is the cau&s;e of di&s;count being given.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman &s;eems to con&s;ider us as mere ma|chines. He &s;ays, if we were left to our&s;elves, we would not be now oppo&s;ed to the bank. I have never been urged to my oppo&s;ition&mdash;I have oppo&s;ed the bank from conviction that the charter was incompatible with the welfare of the &s;tate&mdash;and I concluded it mu&s;t be de&s;troyed. What! does he &s;uppo&s;e we are duped, or that we are di&s;hone&s;t? If we were capable of being bought off, it mu&s;t be acknowledged we have not among us per&s;ons capable to purcha&s;e. If any members of this hou&s;e were corrupt enough to betray for reward the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, the gentlemen on the other &s;ide have the means in their hands to prevail on them.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. I &s;aid that a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;ider|able wealth, oppo&s;ed to the bank from private views, was hugged in the bo&s;oms of tho&s;e inimical to that in&s;titution from other con&s;iderations, although there is no other tie or connection between them.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie. I have never been attempted by any &s;uch per|&s;on. I have taken up the matter upon higher ground: and as to what the gentleman who &s;poke ye&s;terday in favour of the bank, &s;aid, re&s;pecting the attack upon that in&s;titution be|ing levelled at him per&s;onally, I mu&s;t declare that I have been been actuated by no &s;uch motive. As a private citizen, I re&s;pect him&mdash;although as a politician, I happen to differ from him in &s;entiment.</P>
<P>To conclude: We have now no bank. The que&s;tion,
<PB N="112" REF="019884_0115_0FAD403FC71D9C08">
therefore, is, whether we &s;hall have a bank or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">?&mdash;not barely whether we &s;hall have a bank&mdash;but whether we &s;hall have &s;uch a bank as we had before? for no modification is offered&mdash;the report before the hou&s;e propo&s;es to revive the old charter. Are we prepared to agree to &s;uch a report? Are we prepared to give a charter empowering the corporation of the bank to hold ten millions of dollars&mdash;and that in what kind of property they plea&s;e? When I look round me, and &s;ee &s;o many independent members, I feel a confidence that they will never agree to ve&s;t the powers con&s;equent to &s;uch a property in a board of directors cho&s;en by &s;ix or &s;e|ven &s;tockholders. Fears and jealou&s;ies were entertained at the time of granting the charter, when the doctrine of bank|ing was but little under&s;tood: and two attempts were made to limit it: they then only looked forward to the ill con&s;e|quences to be apprehended from it. We have &s;een &s;ome of them: I therefore tru&s;t, that in&s;tead of re&s;toring the charter, in order, as the report &s;ays, to re&s;tore the honour of the &s;tate, we &s;hall &s;ave it from that in&s;trument of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Dr. Logan declared he e&s;teemed him&s;elf &s;o unqualified for a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the que&s;tion under debate, that he had not propo&s;ed to trouble the hou&s;e, by ri&s;ing to &s;peak to it. Being entirely di&s;intere&s;ted in the matter, he had re&s;olved to give his vote according as he &s;hould be convinced; and was &s;orry to &s;ee that the gentlemen oppo&s;ed to the bank, in&s;tead of an|&s;wering the arguments made u&s;e of on the other &s;ide, had recour&s;e to per&s;onalities. The bank, at its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, had been conducted on &s;uch narrow principles, as to induce numbers of gentlemen to unite in their endeavours to e&s;ta|bli&s;h another, which had induced the pre&s;ident and directors to alter their plan. He had then become a &s;ub&s;criber, when the doors were thrown open&mdash;but had &s;ince that period &s;old out.</P>
<P>Had the members who &s;poke again&s;t the pre&s;ent report, made good their charges again&s;t the bank, he had deter|mined to vote with them, although not convinced of the propriety of the hou&s;e a&s;&s;uming judicial powers. But the charges were not made good.</P>
<P>There were, he &s;aid, two modes by which the intere&s;ts of agriculture could be promoted; by a loan office, and by the bank, which latter, furni&s;hing the merchants with money, procured a ready &s;ale for produce. As a farmer, he had ex|perienced the good con&s;equences of it. The other, by ena|bling
<PB N="113" REF="019884_0116_0FAD4041AB8772A8">
the farmer to borrow money for the improvement and cultivation of his lands, greatly advanced his intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mr. Whitehill. One of the city members has remarked, that he believes, if an angel from heaven were to endeavour to convince me, it would have no effect: if an angel &s;poke as he has done, I &s;hould regard him as a fallen angel.</P>
<P>He has &s;aid, that farmers or millers may be accommoda|ted with loans by the bank. But can any farmer in Lanca&s;|ter or Cumberland derive benefit from loans for forty-five days? They cannot come here to renew their obligations.&mdash;Facts are &s;tubborn things.</P>
<P>He al&s;o &s;ays that notwith&s;tanding the cry of the country people for paper money, they will not receive it in payment for their produce. I have received it equal to gold or &s;ilver for produce. Perhaps others are afraid: and indeed when we hear a gentleman of &s;uch wealth and influence declare that he puts it away as fa&s;t as he can, for fear of deprecia|tion, is it not enough to &s;hake the credit of the paper money?</P>
<P>The gentleman has &s;aid that indu&s;try is promoted and ma|nufactures encouraged by the bank: but loans at forty-five days will do neither the one nor the other.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that the bank has not a capital of ten millions of dollars, and that therefore no danger is to be apprehended on that head. But it might have had that capital by the charter: why then &s;hould we re&s;tore it?</P>
<P>A gentleman has in an&s;wer to me remarked, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the legi&s;lature which granted the charter, to know the bye-laws of the bank. I a&s;k, then, was it not ab|&s;urd to give a charter empowering the corporation to make &s;uch bye-laws as they plea&s;ed?</P>
<P>The bank, for aught we know, might have become a tra|ding company; and, by &s;topping di&s;counts, at particular times, might take advantage of the private merchants&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Fitz&s;imons. The corporation is re&s;trained from trading by the charter.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Whitehill demanded&mdash;by what charter?</P>
<P>To this mr. Fitz&s;imons replied by the charter of congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Whitehill. This is nugatory. The charter of con|gre&s;s is of no avail here. Congre&s;s had no power to grant any charter&mdash;and in this in&s;tance &s;tepped out of their line. If that was all the re&s;traint on the pre&s;ident and directors, they might have become a trading company when they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="019884_0117_0FAD4042D46F9140">
The bank, it is hinted, enables the merchant to purcha&s;e produce&mdash;and the farmer con&s;equently gets a better price. But flour was three dollars per hundred, before the revolu|tion, and it is not much higher now.</P>
<P>The whole bu&s;ine&s;s is reduced to this: when the danger of the bank monopolizing trade is urged, the charter of congre&s;s is pleaded; and we are told that the &s;tate is &s;afe. But this is a nullity. Let the bank go on, as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent. The people who deal in it will be &s;afer. If the money in the vaults is not &s;ufficient, the e&s;tates of the &s;ub|&s;cribers will be re&s;pon&s;ible. This has been ob&s;erved already&mdash;and not a word has been offered in an&s;wer to it. Is it not better have two or three equal banks, and then the citizens will be courted for their cu&s;tom, than one which can do as it may &s;ee fit?</P>
<P>Mr. Woods &s;aid if the gentleman's ob&s;ervation, that the charter was but a mere piece of paper, which the hou&s;e might burn at plea&s;ure, was true, the con&s;titution was al&s;o a piece of paper, and might with equal ju&s;tice be burned; if that was the ca&s;e, God help poor Penn&s;ylvania! Tho&s;e gentlemen who pretended to be con&s;titutionali&s;ts, thought them&s;elves exempt from attending to the con&s;titution&mdash;They made it a no&s;e of wax, which they twi&s;ted at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. I did not intend to have ri&s;en again on this que&s;tion: but as &s;ome new matter has occurred, I think it may not be improper to offer a few additional ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>A member has remarked upon the manner in which the que&s;tion was propo&s;ed by the chairman of the committee who&s;e report is under debate&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>whether they were wil|ling to give &s;uch information as was not incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ecrecy of that in&s;titution?</Q> He has from this drawn an inference that any application from the committee of the late hou&s;e would have been fruitle&s;s, on account of this &s;e|crecy. But herein he is much deceived: this &s;ecrecy relates to the &s;tate of accounts depending between individuals and the bank: and the nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;ecrecy every one mu&s;t &s;ee. I appeal to the feelings of all who hear me, whether they would choo&s;e the &s;tate of their accounts &s;hould become known to any but tho&s;e officers of the bank to whom they are confided? The depo&s;itors of money there, would no more have their depo&s;its made public than if the ca&s;h re|mained in their che&s;ts: and much le&s;s would tho&s;e who &s;tand indebted, con&s;ent to have the &s;tate of their accounts known to any but tho&s;e with whom the debt is contracted.
<PB N="115" REF="019884_0118_0FAD4043E17677A0">
As &s;uperintendent of finance, I was entitled to receive daily a &s;tate of the accounts of the bank: but neither the direc|tors nor my&s;elf ever con&s;idered this as extending to the ac|counts of individuals: and I never was made acquainted with any &s;uch matter. This is the only kind of &s;ecrecy, I ap|prehend, that could have been meant by the committee, or that could be nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ident and directors to ob&s;erve; for as to the &s;tate of their own affairs, that is, the affairs of the bank generally, I take it, they would, whene|ver needful or proper, explain them without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>Upon the doctrine of charters, the gentleman in&s;i&s;ts that they cannot be taken away in the courts of law: in which I agree, that unle&s;s there be a forfeiture on the part of the corporation, they cannot.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not, however, dwell upon this &s;ubject&mdash;but proceed to the propo&s;al for mortgaging certain revenues to the bank. That propo&s;al did not go to the extent gentlemen are plea&s;ed to mention. One member has remarked that it is very ex|traordinary &s;uch a propo&s;al &s;hould have been made without the knowledge of the pre&s;ident and directors; and added, that if &s;uch was the ca&s;e, it was an in&s;ult to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>That propo&s;al was made by a member of this hou&s;e, who had a right to make it: and if the hou&s;e had agreed to that propo&s;al, they mu&s;t, as he mentioned at the time, have ap|pointed a committee to negociate and &s;ettle the affair with the pre&s;ident and directors of the bank. Surely there was nothing like an in&s;ult in this.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over the a&s;&s;ertions that the impo&s;t and taxes would not have been &s;ufficient to pay the public creditors, with ob&s;erving that if they had been duly collected, there would have been in the trea&s;ury a &s;um fully adequate.</P>
<P>It has been in&s;i&s;ted that u&s;ury has been coeval with the bank. U&s;ury &s;prung up on the decea&s;e of the continental money; and if I had expected the charge to have been re|newed and in&s;i&s;ted on, I might have brought evidence of the fact. I am &s;atisfied that &s;ome of the brokers' books would &s;hew it, and probably tho&s;e might be obtained without much difficulty.</P>
<P>The member from Fayette &s;eems to charge me with claim|ing the merit of bringing about the revolution. In this, however, no part of my conduct will ju&s;tify him. It is not my practice to claim merits which do not belong to me. It is true, in defending my&s;elf from attacks which have been made, I have been obliged &s;ometimes to mention &s;ervices
<PB N="116" REF="019884_0119_0FAD40445DE3BBC0">
performed; and by &s;o doing, they are &s;ubmitted to public inve&s;tigation, and would be contradicted, if not truly &s;tated. When I mentioned the &s;upplies of flour &s;ent to general Wa&s;hington's camp, it was introduced to &s;hew the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the times: however, I did not, as this gentleman was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s him&s;elf, &s;ay it was &s;ent at my expence; but that it was obtained upon my credit: neither has my va|nity or folly ever prompted me to pretend that I e&s;tabli&s;hed the independence of America. It is my glory to have had a &s;hare in it; and I am not a&s;hamed of the &s;hare which has fallen to my lot; I hope it will ever do me honour.</P>
<P>As to the claims made by the author whom the gentle|man mentioned, I know nothing about them. I &s;hall not conte&s;t his claims, nor tho&s;e of any other per&s;on. Who|ever have de&s;erved well of their country, or think they have done &s;o, &s;hall not be di&s;turbed by me. There are thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands who have been honourably concerned: and I am as ready to give to each his &s;hare of merit, as I am to receive even what credit that gentleman him&s;elf will allow me.</P>
<P>In this hou&s;e we enjoy the freedom of &s;peech: every mem|ber may deliver what &s;entiments he plea&s;es; and, if he choo&s;es, he may attack characters without being accounta|ble to any tribunal, provided he ob&s;erves the decency and decorum due to the hou&s;e: but I cannot refrain from a wi&s;h that it were laid down as a rule, never to abu&s;e this privi|lege, by attacking tho&s;e who cannot &s;peak here, and of cour&s;e have it not in their power to defend them&s;elves. I am led to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, by the gentleman having intro|duced into his &s;peech an author, who, he &s;ays, is unprinci|pled, hires out his pen for pay, and who, in walking the market place, without money in his pocket, finds a five &s;hilling bill, &s;teps into a tavern, procures with it a dinner, &amp;c. and then exclaims, this paper money, after all, if it be not money, is to me victuals and drink. This author, whoever he is, is not on this floor; and con&s;equently cannot do him|&s;elf ju&s;tice here. Whether he is paid or not, I cannot &s;ay. He is not in my pay: nor do I know any that do pay him: for, if I gue&s;s right at the per&s;on, I can pretend to nothing more than common acquaintance, and the intercour&s;e of common civility which has ari&s;en in con&s;equence of his long re&s;idence here, and which originated in his public &s;ervices. But I feel for his &s;ituation, in this in&s;tance, having been, in the &s;ame manner, attacked on this floor, when I could not be permitted to repel tho&s;e attacks, as I had not then a &s;eat
<PB N="117" REF="019884_0120_0FAD40450E92CA08">
in a&s;&s;embly. I do not reproach the member for u&s;ing the freedom of &s;peech&mdash;but I wi&s;h more delicacy were ob&s;erved. If the author in que&s;tion has been guilty of any impropriety, there are proper places to bring him to puni&s;hment, and in which he can be admitted to make his defence.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved in this debate, that the directors of the bank being cho&s;en by the &s;tockholders,&mdash;and the&s;e voting according to property,&mdash;the directors are elected by &s;ix or &s;even men, largely concerned in &s;tock: and this manner of voting is &s;trongly objected to. I a&s;k what &s;hould give the right of voting in &s;uch an in&s;titution, but property? Shall tho&s;e who hold a &s;mall number of &s;hares, have equal votes with tho&s;e who hold a great number? You may as well pa&s;s an Agrarian law, and divide the property. Who would in|ve&s;t their money in &s;uch an in&s;titution, if that regula|tion were to take place? Voting according to property is the only proper mode of election, although a deviation has taken place. Shall a man with a fortieth part of the intere&s;t in bank &s;tock which another holds, have an equal voice with him in the election of tho&s;e who are to manage that intere&s;t? Surely not. It has been &s;aid that the direc|tors exerci&s;e a tyranny over the &s;tockholders. I wi&s;h it had been &s;hewn how: their continuance in office is given as a rea&s;on: and it is urged that they may remain in office as long as they live, which would be a &s;pecies of tyranny. Their continuance in office is a proof that they enjoy the confidence of the &s;tockholders&mdash;not that they tyrannize over them. However, a change in the direction was intend|ed: and a number of the &s;tockholders went to the late elec|tion, with intent to vote-in &s;ome new hands. But the at|tack on the bank &s;eeming to render its duration doubtful, they re-elected the &s;ame gentlemen, in order that if the bu|&s;ine&s;s were to be clo&s;ed, it might be done by tho&s;e&punc; who, having &s;o long conducted it, were be&s;t acquainted with it.</P>
<P>The eleventh and thirteenth articles of the propo&s;als for e&s;tabli&s;hing the bank, publi&s;hed with my name thereto, are brought forward by the member from Fayette, to &s;hew that my &s;entiments are changed re&s;pecting the control of govern|ment over this in&s;titution. The clau&s;e &s;ubjecting the &s;tate of the bank accounts to the in&s;pection of the &s;uperintendent of finance, was then excellent and highly approved, becau&s;e I was the &s;uperintendent&mdash;but now, he remarks, I thank God it is not under the control of government. I am &s;till
<PB N="118" REF="019884_0121_0FAD4045C955EC50">
of opinion that the clau&s;e was excellent, and that it was u&s;eful.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution was framed under an expectation that the public monies were to be placed there from time to time&mdash;and that it would derive advantage from the public funds pa&s;&s;ing through that channel. It was therefore judged pro|per for the bank to &s;ubmit to &s;uch in&s;pection, and nece&s;&s;ary to create public confidence&mdash;fir&s;t, becau&s;e the public money being depo&s;ited there, the united &s;tates would, by their officer, know that it was &s;ecure: and &s;econdly, individuals having tran&s;actions with the bank, would think them&s;elves &s;afe, and believe in its &s;tability, whil&s;t it enjoyed the con|fidence of government, and its proceedings were &s;ubject to &s;uch a check as the in&s;pection of them by a public officer of high tru&s;t. The&s;e are the con&s;iderations that in|duced my approbation to tho&s;e clau&s;es then. But what is the ca&s;e now? The united &s;tates have no longer a &s;uperinten|dent, and although they have a board of trea&s;ury with the &s;ame powers, they have no funds in the bank: therefore no nece&s;&s;ity exi&s;ts of any examination into the &s;tate of that in|&s;titution on their part: and with re&s;pect to individuals, it has fully acquired the nece&s;&s;ary confidence: &s;o that in neither ca&s;e is this in&s;pection any longer nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>If, indeed, the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania had thoughts of de|po&s;iting money in the bank, the government might talk of control; and would have a right to make terms. They might &s;tipulate as a condition, that the trea&s;urer of the &s;tate, or &s;ome other of their officers, &s;hould &s;o far have in&s;pection of the bank, as to know, before the trea&s;urer, the collectors of taxes, of impo&s;ts, of duties, of exci&s;e, &amp;c. &s;hould depo&s;it public monies there, that &s;uch depo&s;its would be perfectly &s;ecure: and I am per&s;uaded that the pre&s;ident and directors would have no objection to the appointment of &s;uch an of|ficer, to whom, in &s;uch ca&s;e, they would freely communicate a &s;tate of the general accounts of the bank. This kind of connection between government and the bank, would be ve|ry proper: but any &s;ubjection or dependence of the bank on the government, would be incon&s;i&s;tent with its nature.&mdash;The attempt, then, to prove any incon&s;i&s;tency in my opi|nions fails&mdash;my pre&s;ent being perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with my former opinions on this point.</P>
<P>As to what I &s;aid re&s;pecting members receiving per cent|age for tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s in the land-office, I do not know it of my own knowledge&mdash;but by information: and I have
<PB N="119" REF="019884_0122_0FAD4046F51088A0">
a paper in my hand, &s;tating that a member of this hou&s;e will, if called upon, prove the fact.</P>
<P>The gentleman &s;aid that this information was addre&s;&s;ed to the gallery. But if the gallery had been cleared, and the doors of this hou&s;e clo&s;ed, I &s;hould have gone into the &s;ame explanation that I have done in the cour&s;e of this bu&s;ine&s;s. It is true, I rejoice that &s;o many of my fellow citizens are pre&s;ent at the&s;e debates: as they will probably, from the explanations re&s;pecting the bank, become better acquainted with the nature of it, than many of them were before; and it only wants to be under&s;tood, to make it fully and clearly &s;een how much the intere&s;t of every man in the &s;tate may be or is benefitted by it.</P>
<P>It has in the cour&s;e of this debate been more than once a&s;&s;erted, that the paper money of the &s;tate, is depreciated by the bank. This I deny totally. The paper money is received on depo&s;it at the bank, at con&s;iderable expence and trouble: one or more clerks at hand&s;ome &s;alaries, are nece&s;&s;ary for the receiving and paying it, and for keeping accounts with the depo&s;itors. The pre&s;ident and directors of the bank do all this without an iota of profit&mdash;being prompted thereto by a de&s;ire of &s;upporting the credit of that paper they are charged with depreciating. From the third of June 1785, to the twenty-eighth of February in the pre&s;ent year, they received of this paper on depo&s;it 104,460l. 18s. 4d. From the twenty-eighth of February, to the pre&s;ent day, they have received 2819l. 15s. 8d.&mdash;making in the whole 107,280l. 14s. And the credit of this account is,&mdash;For &s;undries paid from the third of June 1785, to the twenty-eighth of February, 97,767l. 15s. 6d. ditto paid from the fir&s;t to the twenty-eighth of March, 3520l. 11s. 6d.&mdash;Balance remaining on hand, 5992l. 7s. From this &s;tatement it appears, that the whole amount of the emi&s;&s;ion, that for the loan-office ex|cepted, has already pa&s;&s;ed through the bank: for this, ac|counts have been opened in bank for &s;ixty-&s;even per&s;ons.&mdash;I hope it will not be a&s;&s;erted that all the&s;e pains are taken in order to de&s;troy the credit of the paper money. I have already an&s;wered the charges again&s;t my&s;elf on this &s;ubject,&mdash;although perhaps it might have been as well to pa&s;s them by, as I have done others, in &s;ilent contempt.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Fayette with much mode&s;ty, declares, he does not pretend to an equal degree of under&s;tanding with us. We, however, admit that he has it, and the con|te&s;t between us, is an acknowledgment, on our part, of
<PB N="120" REF="019884_0123_0FAD40478C9E6478">
his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing equal abilities: but I hope this mode&s;ty was not a&s;&s;umed to extort compliments from us.</P>
<P>The gentleman &s;ays, he hopes the members of this hou&s;e are not capable of being corrupted. I hope with him that they are not. I have no &s;u&s;picions of the kind&mdash;nor ever had. But members of a&s;&s;embly are liable to be influ|enced in their conduct, as well as other men. However, whether they are or are not, I have never made an attempt to influence any one of them: nor can any one &s;ay, that I have ever held a conver&s;ation, done, or &s;aid a &s;ingle thing to influence his vote upon any que&s;tion whatever.</P>
<P>Mr. Smilie. The worthy member gave the hou&s;e to un|der&s;tand, that if it were not for &s;ome people, we would not now be oppo&s;ed to the bank. On this I remarked, that if we were capable of being corrupted, tho&s;e on our &s;ide of the que&s;tion had not the means of corruption in their hands.</P>
<P>Mr. R. Morris. As there are per&s;ons out of doors preju|diced again&s;t the in&s;titution, it is natural for them to exert all their influence to injure it. They get hold of the mem|bers&mdash;and tell them fine &s;tories, make &s;trong a&s;&s;ertions, and by degrees lead them into their &s;nares, by means of decep|tion, without any attempt at corruption: and this is by no means uncommon. It is well known that mankind are &s;laves to prejudices&mdash;and to prejudices frequently not their own&mdash;but &s;uch as are taken up on the credit of others. I thank God our legi&s;lature is incorruptible. I believe it has always been &s;o: and I hope it will ever &s;o continue&mdash;at lea&s;t we have one &s;ecurity for it&mdash;I cannot &s;ee how or for what it would be worth while to corrupt them, were they &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. If in this or any other part of the debate, when animated with the &s;ubject, I have not treated the members oppo&s;ed to me with all the decency and decorum they could wi&s;h, I &s;hould be &s;orry for it&mdash;as being contrary to my intention: but I am not &s;en&s;ible that any &s;uch thing has e&s;caped me. Indecen|cies may tend to inflame&mdash;but they &s;eldom convince.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman &s;ays, he re&s;pects my private charac|ter&mdash;but mu&s;t differ from me in politics. I wi&s;h we could agree in our political opinions: it might be of &s;ome advan|tage to the &s;tate: but as we cannot, we mu&s;t be content&mdash;he to hold his opinions&mdash;and I to enjoy mine.</P>
<P>Some expre&s;&s;ions which have dropped from this gentleman and from the member from Cumberland, &s;eem to imply, that had the report before us, propo&s;ed any modification of the bank charter, it might have met with their approbation&mdash;but
<PB N="121" REF="019884_0124_0FAD4049A454C800">
that in its pre&s;ent form, it is inadmi&s;&s;ible. I do not &s;ee how the committee could have made a report of that kind: they certainly were not authori&s;ed to do it. It has been fully proved that the repealing law does not re&s;t on the &s;ame &s;up|port as our other laws: it is not founded in truth and fact&mdash;but in the preamble the rever&s;e is a&s;&s;erted: and this is of it|&s;elf a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for repealing that repealing law.</P>
<P>I am not willing to take up more of the time of this hou&s;e: it would be going over again the &s;ame beaten track. We are pretty well tired of the &s;ubject by this time: and I hope the que&s;tion will &s;oon be put. I hope that no doubts remain as to the utility of the bank. I tru&s;t it has been clearly pro|ved, that it has never been injurious to the &s;afety or welfare of the &s;tate in any &s;hape or way.</P>
<P>Mr. Finlay. Had my arguments of ye&s;terday, been &s;tated ju&s;tly, and replied to with fairne&s;s, I would not have thought it nece&s;&s;ary further to detain this hou&s;e&mdash;as the at|tention of the members is, I conceive, already wearied out. I have, doubtle&s;s, been unhappy in &s;peaking le&s;s di&s;tinctly or le&s;s audibly than u&s;ual, &s;o as to occa&s;ion them to be un|ju&s;tly &s;tated. The manner in which I then inve&s;tigated the ca&s;e, has been made an honourable mention of by the gen|tlemen on the other &s;ide of the debate; but could I a&s;cribe the treatment my arguments met with, in &s;tating them ye&s;|terday, from a gentleman of eminent di&s;cernment [mr. Mor|ris] to artifice, it would be a more flattering circum&s;tance, than any eulogiums the gentleman has been plea&s;ed to be|&s;tow. However, candour obliges me to acknowledge that the gentleman who &s;poke fir&s;t this morning [mr. Fitz&s;imons] replied to &s;ome of my arguments with ability, &s;tated them fairly, and an&s;wered &s;en&s;ibly. And there are, certainly, many good arguments re&s;pecting the conveniency of the bank, that may apply in its favour: and it is the duty of this hou&s;e to compare the arguments ari&s;ing either from its utility or its mi&s;chief&mdash;its &s;afety or its danger&mdash;and by giv|ing each of them due weight, to ob&s;erve how the balance turns.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to mention &s;ome in&s;tances of the treat|ment my arguments met with ye&s;terday; and then pro|&s;ecute &s;ome ob&s;ervations which I touched but &s;lightly at the fir&s;t&mdash;and al&s;o &s;ome which I then waved.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t argument was entirely mi&s;-&s;tated. Knowing that the preamble of the report under debate, contains rea&s;oning totally improper and di&s;graceful, I thought it would have
<PB N="122" REF="019884_0125_0FAD404A49AC0748">
been an in&s;ult to the dignity of the hou&s;e to argue upon it, which I therefore declined, alleging, that though the rea|&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by the committee of the late hou&s;e, for re|pealing the charter, were in&s;ufficient, yet, if &s;ufficient rea&s;ons do now exi&s;t in the nature of the ca&s;e, their deci&s;ion ought not to be repealed. This I illu&s;trated by judicial examples; and alluded to legi&s;lative ones, of which I &s;hall now mention one. In the act lately pa&s;&s;ed for opening the road by the Water Gap, the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, is, that there is no road there. Surely, this is not the true rea&s;on, although it is the only one a&s;&s;igned by this hou&s;e: for if that were the true and a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, it would imply that this hou&s;e ought to make &s;pecial laws for opening roads in all places where they are wanted, which is, by &s;tanding laws, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the county courts. The true rea&s;on mu&s;t have been not only the utility of that road, but the broken and uninhabited &s;tate of that country. But the gentleman alleged that I applied this argument to the re&s;olution now before the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I mentioned agrarian laws merely on account of the u&s;e the gentleman had made of them, in alleging that the char|ter of the bank could not be taken away without admitting agrarian laws. I ob&s;erved that though wealth was not equal enough in this &s;tate to the genius of our government, yet to admit tho&s;e laws was improper; and, under our govern|ment, would be unju&s;t: but that they had nothing to do with the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, which was not taking away property&mdash;was not touching the ca&s;h of the proprietors of the bank&mdash;but &s;olely repealing a law which gave an undue and impartial ad|vantage to one &s;et of men. How could the gentleman's fears be alarmed from this? How could he &s;ay that I alleg|ed though agrarian laws were not ju&s;t now proper, that they would be &s;o &s;ome &s;hort time hence? It was the gentle|man him&s;elf introduced the term: and I only attempted to re&s;cue it from the improper u&s;e he had made of it.</P>
<P>I mentioned as an argument the un&s;uitablene&s;s of &s;uch an in&s;titution to the government, laws, and habits of this &s;tate. The gentleman &s;tated that I had &s;aid it was contrary to law. Surely, if a di&s;putant has the power to make his antagoni&s;t &s;ay what he plea&s;es, he may ea&s;ily reply: &s;o the gentleman has done. He &s;ays it was not contrary to law&mdash;becau&s;e the charter was a law. It was not contrary to habit&mdash;for the people had a habit of applying at the bank for di&s;counts,
<PB N="123" REF="019884_0126_0FAD404BF3342780">
and carrying their money there to depo&s;it it. I beg now to repeat and enforce &s;ome of my arguments on that head.</P>
<P>The frame of government of this &s;tate, being the great deed of tru&s;t between tho&s;e in government and the citizens at large, is a charter of the fir&s;t importance; and circum|&s;cribes and contains all other charters that can lawfully ex|i&s;t: yet it is a charter for only &s;even years. It is not only &s;ub|ject to change, as all other governments are, by natural right&mdash;but it mu&s;t, by the law of its own exi&s;tence, be brought to the te&s;t &s;eptennially. And can the legi&s;lature give charters more &s;acred and more permanent than the go|vernment it&s;elf? No: the very nature of things forbids it. By our laws, all e&s;tates, real or per&s;onal, are divi&s;able; the grand &s;ource and &s;upport of feudal dignity are therefore taken away&mdash;&s;ince by law, every child, with one &s;mall ex|ception, enjoys an equal &s;hare: and our habits with re&s;pect to te&s;taments perhaps corre&s;pond more perfectly with our laws, than tho&s;e of any other country in the world. Our real e&s;tates are &s;ubject to be &s;old for debts; and are actually daily &s;elling in this manner. In a country, where we have no wealthy incorporated companies of merchants&mdash;where we have no nobles with great e&s;tates, permanent in the family line&mdash;where we have no royal prerogative &s;upported by an enor|mous civil li&s;t and numberle&s;s dependents&mdash;I &s;ay in a country where we have no counterpoi&s;e to correct its influence or control its enormities by their own&mdash;&s;hall we grant &s;uch an in&s;titution? Shall we give &s;uch an artificial &s;pring to con|gregated wealth? By no means. It was in this manner I argued its incon&s;i&s;tence with the &s;pirit of our laws, &amp;c. and not in the manner &s;tated by the gentleman.</P>
<P>My arguments on the u&s;efulne&s;s of the bank&mdash;and the ex|amples by which I illu&s;trated them&mdash;were treated in the &s;ame manner. But this hou&s;e heard my arguments and the man|ner in which the gentleman accommodated them to his re|plies: therefore I &s;hall not re&s;cue them; but &s;hall ju&s;t ob|&s;erve, that I acknowledged freely the u&s;efulne&s;s of the bank&mdash;I gave it all the credit I thought it de&s;erved: but did the gentleman acknowledge the u&s;efulne&s;s of paper money or a loan office? Did he give paper money one grateful compli|ment for the good it has at any time done? No&mdash;he did not.</P>
<P>I forbore ye&s;terday &s;aying much about paper money or a loan office&mdash;as things &s;ufficiently under&s;tood: but I beg leave now to offer a few further ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting them. By the la&s;t emi&s;&s;ion we have anticipated our revenue, and &s;o
<PB N="124" REF="019884_0127_0FAD404D07A8F000">
made a &s;aving to the &s;tate; by it we have relieved our &s;uffer|ing creditors; by it we have brought in our revenues, and filled our trea&s;ury, which had for years groaned with empti|ne&s;s. By means of the &s;pring it gave to circulation, it brought in more &s;pecie than we could have otherwi&s;e got. By means of it, the gentleman an&s;werable to his wi&s;hes, will get more old debts paid in to him; and, an&s;werable to his diffi|dence, he acknowledges he can put it away again immedi|ately. By the la&s;t emi&s;&s;ion, Penn&s;ylvania has recovered her dignity; and &s;hewn her&s;elf to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that wi&s;dom which pervaded her coun&s;els whil&s;t &s;he was a colony.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of a loan-office is one of the mo&s;t ma&s;ter|ly &s;trokes of national good &s;en&s;e: the advantages of the pre&s;ent one, though &s;o new in its operations, have been of amazing &s;ervice. Va&s;t numbers of our citizens were in debt to the &s;tate for their lands, which they held by occupancy only: tho&s;e people have been enabled to pay their debts to the &s;tate; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the public creditors, by increa&s;ing the demand for their certificates. I will mention one in|&s;tance:&mdash;as I was coming to this city la&s;t week, I met with a man who had patented his own land, and procured a loan of one hundred pounds. In con&s;equence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> orders I had with me, I received about half his loan; and brought it back to pay for the lands of others. Thus it not only pays an intere&s;t, but &s;inks a treble intere&s;t.</P>
<P>A loan-office, at this time, is not only a &s;ource of reve|nue, to the amount of the net intere&s;t it brings; but has contributed by rai&s;ing the demand, to rai&s;e the public certi|ficates from 3s. 9d. to 6s.: and as every pound value of them laid out as above, takes off an intere&s;t from three to four for one, by &s;inking &s;uch a proportion of the public debts&mdash;it is one of tho&s;e honourable and u&s;eful kinds of &s;peculation, fraught with advantage both to the &s;tate and to individuals; and gives the &s;ure&s;t fund for the redemption of paper money. The in&s;titution of a bank, on the other hand, as I &s;aid before, increa&s;es u&s;ury; promotes the &s;pirit of mo|nopoly; and, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, prevents improve|ments and equal circulation of money.</P>
<P>All the gentlemen on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, deny that it promotes u&s;ury. Let us examine this a little. Does it not give a facility to trade? Is not this its proper u&s;e? Is not the balance of trade again&s;t us? Does it not, therefore, give facility to importation in a degree too great for our exporta|tion? Surely, it does. When gentlemen obtain the a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;the
<PB N="125" REF="019884_0128_0FAD404D49340888">
ready and generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the bank, to purcha&s;e imported goods&mdash;mu&s;t they not pay at a &s;hort and a certain day? And when the market is glutted with goods, and the appetite of the con&s;umer cloyed, what &s;hall&mdash;what can the borrower do? He may and often does go to the vendue &s;tores, and lo&s;e his property by ready money &s;ales, at the rate of 50s. a minute: or he may go to the rapacious bro|kers, who&s;e exi&s;tence in Philadelphia is coeval with the bank, and of them borrow at five or &s;ix per cent. per month. This has been the relief, no le&s;s common than de|&s;tructive&mdash;the mournful relief of tho&s;e who have with the be&s;t de&s;igns and flattering expectations, made u&s;e of the de|lu&s;ory a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the bank: and thus it is likely to be with every in&s;titution incon&s;i&s;tent with the laws and manners of a people.</P>
<P>But this is not all: the bank, it is certain, takes a kind of compound intere&s;t it&s;elf: and when &s;imple intere&s;t re|quires about &s;eventeen years to enable one million of dol|lars to grow into two&mdash;the method practi&s;ed by the bank (&s;uppo&s;ing the holders not to draw their dividends) would make one million produce above &s;ix in about 26 years: and to follow this thought for a century to come, how ama|zing the idea! In the bank money is arre&s;ted. It mu&s;t in|crea&s;e, without a po&s;&s;ibility of becoming le&s;s. It is &s;ecured by &s;uch a charter from every ri&s;k, and guarded again&s;t every danger but what may ari&s;e from the po&s;&s;ible villainy of the conductors of its operations.</P>
<P>As wealth is the means of conducting&mdash;as wealth is the means of obtaining monopolies&mdash;even when in the hands of jarring individuals&mdash;how much more mu&s;t it facilitate &s;uch de&s;igns, when in the hands of a permanent &s;ociety, congre|gated by &s;pecial privilege, and actuated by the principles of united avarice? Let us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that I po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed the greate&s;t real e&s;tate under the government, and that I had likewi&s;e the greate&s;t commercial wealth, and con&s;e|quently a greater credit in all commercial countries than any other citizen in the &s;tate, and that I had the greate&s;t number of &s;hares in, and con&s;equently the greate&s;t influence over the bank, would not I in this ca&s;e have it in my power to mono|polize the mo&s;t valuable foreign markets, and to &s;ay who &s;hall and who &s;hall not trade? Would it not be in my power to fix the rate of exchange as I plea&s;ed&mdash;&s;o that when in the natural cour&s;e of trade it &s;hould be 163 or 170, I could rai&s;e
<PB N="126" REF="019884_0129_0FAD404E25AE9758">
it to 175 or 180? I could increa&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of remitting by bills, and avail my&s;elf of that nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The bank in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, prevents even the improvement of this city. Hou&s;es and lands have been &s;old, and their price locked up in the bank, where it is free from taxes, and where it increa&s;es without the labour of the ow|ner. Thus by di&s;couraging improvements, it prevents po|pulation, and with it the ri&s;ing glory and &s;trength of the commonwealth. An equal circulation of the &s;igns of wealth, tends to promote equal intere&s;ts&mdash;equal manners&mdash;and equal de&s;igns: but the &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of few countries admit of equal circulation: yet &s;urely government ought not to give its &s;pecial aid to render circulation nece&s;&s;arily un|equal. However this is an argument well under&s;tood, and has been &s;poken to formerly.</P>
<P>One gentleman [mr. Morris] would per&s;uade us that the transfers of &s;tock prevent the dangers or cure the evils of the in&s;titution. How can this be? Will a few individuals transferring their bank &s;tock, change the principles&mdash;the nature&mdash;and influence of the in&s;titution? By no means; but this is too plain a ca&s;e to dwell upon; and has already been well &s;poken to.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the right of the legi&s;lature to di&s;&s;olve &s;uch char|ters, it has been often &s;aid that that body might as well di&s;|annul the patents of our lands: and for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, agrarian laws have been, I think, rather improperly men|tioned. What do the&s;e arguments mean? Is di&s;&s;olving the charter of the bank, and entering into it, to take away the gold and &s;ilver from the owners, for the public u&s;e, the &s;ame thing? Surely no. But the right of the legi&s;lature is &s;o clearly confe&s;&s;ed by gentlemen of legal knowledge&mdash;it is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the &s;afety of government&mdash;and has already been &s;o well &s;poken to&mdash;that it would perhaps be an in&s;ult to the good &s;en&s;e of this hou&s;e, to &s;ay any thing further on this head.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid by gentlemen on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, re&s;pecting the advantage ari&s;ing from the bank to the farmer, the mechanic, &amp;c.&mdash;It &s;eems to be denied that the balance of trade is again&s;t us; or that the bank promotes that unfavourable balance. One gentleman [mr. Fitz&s;imons] &s;uppo&s;es that I &s;tated the exports from Penn&s;ylvania too low: I believe he did not hear me well&mdash;for in every other mention of my arguments, he did me ju&s;tice. I will there|fore repeat my &s;entiments on that head. We export flour&mdash;but not &s;o much as formerly: this is owing, among other
<PB N="127" REF="019884_0130_0FAD404ECD892238">
things, to a &s;carcity of labouring people: the drain of young men during the war, and for many years having &s;o few emi|grants, accounts for this. We export flax&s;eed, though not &s;o much of it as u&s;ual: the binding of our lands, through long working, and the change of &s;ea&s;ons, together with people depending more upon hemp, accounts for this. That the lumber trade mu&s;t continue to decay, requires no inve&s;|tigation to account for it. What el&s;e of con&s;equence does Penn&s;ylvania export? Nothing, I believe, worth enumerat|ing: yet we have the foundations of commerce, which ri&s;ing ages will doubtle&s;s improve. I perfectly ageee with the gen|tleman that it is our duty to cultivate the mutual intere&s;t of the farmer, the mechanic, and the merchant; but how is this to be done? We have been told we ought to alter the balance of trade, &amp;c. but in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, we may as well talk of turning the &s;tream of the Delaware. To cultivate the&s;e now jarring intere&s;ts, and render them mutual, we mu&s;t fir&s;t propagate or import a greater number of peo|ple, that we may have labour of all &s;orts cheaper; we mu&s;t encourage our own produce and manufactures; we mu&s;t try to curb our luxury&mdash;to mortify our madne&s;s for trade and foreign wares. Our pre&s;ent manner of trading, if per&s;i&s;ted in, mu&s;t prevent us from ever being in any reputable degree, an independent or a commercial nation; &s;till it is &s;aid that the balance of trade is not &s;o much again&s;t us; but I a&s;k any gentleman acquainted with it, if the rate of exchange is not again&s;t us? I a&s;k is not the rate of exchange the touch&s;tone of trade&mdash;and the infallible criterion which &s;ide the balance turns to? It &s;hews the price of money. Is not the rate of exchange more again&s;t us than before the bank exi&s;ted? I be|lieve it is; and the influence of the bank is well calculated to keep it &s;o. I wi&s;h for a commerce built upon the foundation of population and indu&s;try; every other kind of commerce mu&s;t be ruinous, and ought to be di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>The trade of Am&s;terdam has been mentioned by a gentle|man, and applied to our ca&s;e; but I cannot &s;ee any &s;imilarity. It is true, the people of Am&s;terdam have very little of the produce of their own country to trade upon; but they make the materials of almo&s;t all the world their own&mdash;&s;o as to promote population and indu&s;try; they are in a great degree the mechanics, the factors, and the carriers of Europe; and their wealth is the envy even of London her&s;elf. But we neither manufacture nor carry for our&s;elves&mdash;nor do we get rich.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="019884_0131_0FAD404FD1C178A0">
A gentleman from the city [mr. Fitz&s;imons] has men|tioned the cheap bargains overtrading and u&s;ury have given many an opportunity of obtaining: but I &s;hould have thought this a &s;ufficient argument on the other &s;ide. Is it not an evidence of the evils about which we complain? Is it not the cau&s;e of the ruin of many?</P>
<P>The great amount of the impo&s;t received la&s;t year is al&s;o u&s;ed as an argument: certainly this is an inconte&s;tible evi|dence to my purpo&s;e. We received 100,000l. of an impo&s;t: and we may pre&s;ume that much e&s;caped the notice of the officers: and the impo&s;t a part of that time was low: how a|mazingly, therefore, mu&s;t our imports have exceeded our exports! I &s;uppo&s;e the difference could not have been le&s;s than fifty, perhaps a hundred to one. Can any nation long exi&s;t, conducting &s;uch a trade? The gentleman mentions the va&s;t improvements occa&s;ioned in Scotland by banks &s;ince their e&s;tabli&s;hment. I believe Scotland has received benefit from banks: but our circum&s;tances and tho&s;e of Scotland are very different; and though I am not &s;ufficiently inform|ed to be able to de&s;cribe the banks of Scotland, I know they are neither chartered nor conducted like the late bank, now under debate.</P>
<P>A worthy member [mr. Morris] in his arguments in fa|vour of the bank told this hou&s;e, that I al&s;o loved wealth, and pur&s;ued it&mdash;Doubtle&s;s I do. I love and pur&s;ue it&mdash;not as an end, but as a means of enjoying happine&s;s and independence; and &s;o far I am for enjoying it. Though I have it not in any proportion to the degree of what the worthy gentleman has informed us of him&s;elf&mdash;yet I have more land than I can make a proper u&s;e of, and not a great deal le&s;s than I wi&s;h to have, though I purcha&s;ed it at &s;econd hand. I have enough of wealth to give a &s;pring to indu&s;try; and to procure the nece&s;&s;aries and a competence of the comforts of life. But he has &s;aid that I follow land-jobbing; that he has &s;een me in the land office; and that if I did not procure lands for my&s;elf, I charged com|mi&s;&s;ion upon doing it for my neighbours. I denied the&s;e charges with perhaps too much warmth&mdash;not becau&s;e they were di&s;graceful&mdash;but becau&s;e they were, as applied to me, mi&s;taken; the gentleman has told us to-day that he is able to prove the charge again&s;t &s;ome one per&s;on. I wi&s;h the per&s;on was produced, and the charge proved; I &s;hould in|&s;i&s;t on the proof being brought forward, but from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that it will not apply to me&mdash;and from an opinion that it was improperly introduced into the pre&s;ent debate.
<PB N="129" REF="019884_0132_0FAD40509B95DBF0">
However, I believe, if members of this hou&s;e are meant, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> are rare; and I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed the whole as a piece of humour, but for the opportunity it gives me of offering a &s;hort but true picture of the &s;ituation of many of my con&s;tituents. Living as they do, in a new &s;ettlement, after having encountered the accumulated woods of ages, and bea&s;ts ravenous by nature, and rendered &s;till more &s;o by the unbounded extent of their range, they had &s;carcely made openings round their abodes&mdash;they had not bani&s;hed the bea&s;ts of prey&mdash;when men more fierce, more cruel than the bea&s;ts, de&s;olated their new rai&s;ed dwellings, and &s;pread de|&s;truction far and wide. Now, when they are returned, and feebly repairing the ruins of their dreary wa&s;tes, they find them&s;elves in debt to the &s;tate for the very lands in defend|ing which many of them lo&s;t their deare&s;t friends and all their wealth. They endeavour&mdash;they &s;trive with arduous diligence to pay the &s;tate its due: and, to be able to call the lands their own, they &s;ell the la&s;t cow and &s;heep, to procure a little money (for nothing but cows and &s;heep will find mo|ney there). I my&s;elf have been urged to take the la&s;t cow&mdash;to take any thing they had, in order to &s;ecure their lands. They rai&s;e the la&s;t &s;hilling they are able&mdash;and plead, as if for life, that we may add a few dollars to the &s;canty &s;um; and the&s;e are the people from whom the gentleman &s;eems to think I take enriching commi&s;&s;ions; but all the ge|nerous feelings of the human &s;oul forbid &s;uch means of ob|taining wealth; and it is a method much better &s;uited to the habits of a merchant than a farmer.</P>
<P>One argument much u&s;ed on the other &s;ide of the debate, I beg leave, altho' it has been well replied to already, to notice a little further. It re&s;pects the number of petitioners who have now brought this matter (it is &s;aid) before the hou&s;e&mdash;it is emphatically called the voice of the people. In addition to what other gentlemen have ju&s;tly ob&s;erved upon this ar|gument, I would further remark, that in every government (even the mo&s;t ab&s;olute) the popular opinion, if not immoral, is the voice of God; but in Penn&s;ylvania, it is not only for|mally but in fact the voice of the government&mdash;the govern|ment being &s;olely founded on the popular authority; and the legi&s;lature being authori&s;ed and in&s;tructed to &s;peak the popular voice, they are nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak the voice of the people; one exception may be admitted, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> if &s;ome new ca&s;e ari&s;e, or if &s;ome new information is ob|tained, the majority of the people in&s;tructing and informing
<PB N="130" REF="019884_0133_0FAD4053493A9068">
their repre&s;entatives, ought to be attended to. But is this the ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent debate? By no means. The peti|tioners do not amount to one twentieth of our con&s;tituents; and under all the influence that the nature of the in&s;titution cannot fail to produce on the human mind, &s;urely it is won|derful, every thing con&s;idered, that a much greater number of petitioners was not obtained, and &s;trange that the gentle|men &s;hould make u&s;e of the few that are obtained, as an ar|gument; but the ca&s;e is too plain to be dwelt upon.</P>
<P>Having laboured arguments too long, which are clear in them&s;elves, and, I tru&s;t, well under&s;tood in this hou&s;e&mdash;I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve that as &s;ome of them have been mis-&s;tated, a few in&s;tances of which I have mentioned&mdash;and &s;ome others replied to with candour and ability&mdash;and as the two gentle|men who have ri&s;en in an&s;wer, have made honourable men|tion of my general arguments, but &s;tated their objections&mdash;I have ground to believe that tho&s;e ob&s;ervations of mine which have not been replied to, are admitted; and, indeed, as they were drawn from the nature of things, I think they were unan&s;werable&mdash;for things will ever operate according to their nature.</P>
<P>We are one great family: and the laws are our com|mon inheritance. They are general rules, and common in their nature. No man has a greater claim of &s;pecial privi|lege for his &pound;.100,000 than I have for my &pound;5. No. The laws are a common property. The legi&s;lature are entru&s;ted with the di&s;tribution of them. This hou&s;e will not&mdash;this hou&s;e has no right, no con&s;titutional power to give monopo|lies of legal privilege&mdash;to be&s;tow unequal portions of our common inheritance on favourites.</P>
<P>This bank, the charter of which has been di&s;&s;olved, and is now endeavoured to be renewed again, was truly an ex|traordinary creature. None like it does, I believe&mdash;none like it ever did exi&s;t in any nation: and &s;urely &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> being will never be re&s;tored&mdash;will never be created again by the le|gi&s;lature of this &s;tate. If we &s;hould re&s;tore it, we would have no &s;ecurity but in the moderation of the directors and &s;tock|holders: but who will an&s;wer&mdash;who can be re&s;pon&s;ible for fu|ture men&mdash;future times&mdash;and future events?</P>
<P>Mr. Clymer. Being con&s;iderably indi&s;po&s;ed, I &s;hould not have taken any part in this day's debate, but that the report before us has been cavilled at. The gentleman from Fayette has again cen&s;ured the charge in it, again&s;t the committee of the late hou&s;e for not making enquiry at the bank. Where
<PB N="131" REF="019884_0134_0FAD4054615470B0">
would have been the u&s;e of this, &s;ays he, does any one think the pre&s;ident and directors would have given any informa|tion again&s;t them&s;elves? I will tell that gentleman its u&s;es: It would have, at lea&s;t, &s;atisfied the forms of ju&s;tice: and, had an&s;wers to proper que&s;tions been refu&s;ed, it would have furni&s;hed more real matter again&s;t them, than any which has been alleged. The gentleman from We&s;tmore|land has found it exceptionable in attacking the law on a wrong principle. When a law is once pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ays he, you &s;hould attend to its policy&mdash;and not to the means by which it was obtained&mdash;or, in effect, if the end be good, it &s;hall &s;anctify the means. It has been a reproach to the order of the je&s;uits, that they held this doctrine: but I find there may be je&s;uits out of the Roman church. It is not taught by any pre&s;byterian &s;ynod that I know of. It is not drawn from religion or morals&mdash;it is not the u&s;ual doctrine of the world,&mdash;near three thou&s;and of our fellow citizens know nothing of it: they have, in their memorials to this hou&s;e, omitted the policy of the law, to arraign the means of obtaining it&mdash;it was &s;ufficient for them that the means were bad. The committee to whom their memorials were referred, have fol|lowed their example: they have proved that the late hou&s;e were deceived by their committee&mdash;that the repealing law &s;tands upon the fal&s;e&s;t ground, the a&s;&s;umption in the pream|ble being ab&s;olutely without &s;upport from fact, and is not now contended for in argument: they are therefore fully ju&s;tified in the conclu&s;ions they have drawn from tho&s;e premi&s;es.</P>
<P>It was the lea&s;t of my de&s;ign to touch upon any thing but what concerned the report: but as the vote is, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be immediately put, I would rectify the &s;ame gentleman's no|tion concerning the banks of Scotland, which he &s;eems to think are banks of mortgage: as far as I have read or heard, there were two banks of di&s;count at Edinburgh, which al&s;o lent on mortgage for a time, as long as they were able. Being obliged to drop the practice, the landholders, to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities, in&s;tituted a new bank at Ayr, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of lending on mortgage. But the long credit on &s;uch loans, &s;oon reduced it to the greate&s;t difficulties. It at length broke, and involved the whole country in ruin.</P>
<P>Previous to putting the que&s;tion on the report, mr. Han|num moved to add to the re&s;olution it contained, a direction to the committee to introduce a clau&s;e into the bill it recom|mended to be brought in, a clau&s;e &s;ubjecting the charter of the bank to proper regulations, re&s;trictions and limitations.</P>
