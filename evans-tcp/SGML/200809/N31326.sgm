<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AS</HI> it is not the De&s;ign of the following Sheets to ca&s;t the popular Odium on either of the Parties, but merely to expo&s;e the Attempt to obtain Redre&s;s in behalf of the Defendant, and in his Ab&s;ence, again&s;t a legal Determination of the Suit, by a Method entirely new, uncon&s;titutional and illegal; a particular Detail of the Evi|dence on both Sides is carefully avoided.</P>
<P>The &s;trange and unnatural Con&s;truction which has been lately given to his Maje&s;ty's Royal Order, with a View to countenance the Appeal &s;ought for in behalf of the Defendant, and the dangerous Tendency of &s;uch a Con&s;truction, are the Objects which the Editor has in View. This Con&s;truction mu&s;t indeed be alarming to every Briti&s;h Subject; who, among the many invaluable Privileges, by which he is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Subjects of other Princes, will naturally e&s;teem a Trial by his Peers as one of the greate&s;t &mdash; In &s;hort it is a Con&s;truction which &s;ubverts the antient and fundamental Law of the Land, renders all Property in the Colonies precarious and of little Value, and the Method of obtaining Ju&s;tice extremely dilatory, and exten|&s;ively ruinous to the Litigants.</P>
<P>But to &s;hew the pernicious Con&s;equences of this Con&s;truction, Arguments need not here be urged &mdash; His Honour the Chief Ju&s;tice has, in the legal Di&s;charge of his important Tru&s;t, a&s;&s;igned &s;uch Rea&s;ons, as mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to expo&s;e the fal&s;e and pernici|ous Doctrine, <HI>that the Crown by its In&s;truction de&s;igned to change the Laws of the Land, or to execute Ju&s;tice by other Means than are known in the Mother Country.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>Thomas For&s;ey, again&s;t Waddel Cunningham.</HI> Report of an Action of A&s;&s;ault, Battery and Wounding, tried in the Supreme Court of New-York, October <HI>1764.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Suit was brought for a violent A&s;&s;ault, Battery, and Wounding, committed by the Defendant on the Plaintiff, on the 28th Day of July 1763. The Chief Ju&s;tice, on a Petition and Affidavit of the Violence of the Battery, gave his Order for holding the Defendant to Bail, in &pound;.5000.</P>
<P>Upon the Return of the Writ in October Term 1763, the Plaintiff declared, in the u&s;ual Form; and after an Imparlance to January Term following, the Defendant pleaded the general I&s;&s;ue, Not Guilty.</P>
<P>In April Term 1764, the Defendant moved the Court for a &s;truck Jury, which Motion was granted, and a Jury was accordingly &s;truck during the Term.</P>
<P>In October Term following, the Cau&s;e came on regularly, to be tried by the Jury that had been &s;truck at the Defendant's Reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="041438_0006_101A88C7C6D680E8">The Trial la&s;ted near twelve Hours, in the Cour&s;e of which, the Proof of the Battery was &s;o full and clear, that the Defendant relied only on &s;ome Evidence in Mitigation of Damages, in the Production of which, the fulle&s;t and faire&s;t Scope was given to him.</P>
<P>There were three Gentlemen, of Council for the Plaintiff, and four for the Defendant; the Witne&s;&s;es on both Sides were very fully and circum&s;tantially examined, and the Evid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce as fully and circum&s;tantially &s;ummed up by the Council, for both Parties: The Jury went from the Bar late in the Evening, and returned to it the next Morning with their privy Verdict; by which they found the Defendant Guilty of the Tre&s;pa&s;s, A&s;&s;ault, Battery and Wounding charged in the Plaintiff's Decla|ration; and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Plaintiff's Damages, at one thou&s;and five hun|dred Pounds, and his Co&s;ts at &s;ix Pence.</P>
<P>On Saturday, the la&s;t Day of the Term, the Defendant's Council moved the Court, to &s;et a&s;ide the Verdict, for the Largene&s;s of the Damages; but the Court conceiving that the Damages were not exce&s;|&s;ive, rejected the Motion, and ordered Judgment to be entered for the Plaintiff. The Defendant being ab&s;ent beyond Sea, Robert R. Waddel who acts for him under a Letter of Attorney, then came up to the Bench; and pre&s;ented to the Judges, a Petition to admit an Entry of an Appeal to the Governor and Council, and a Bond with Security, as grounded upon the In&s;truction. The Court &s;uffered no Entry to be made, and returned the Papers; declaring no &s;uch Appeal would lie, and that the In&s;truction was not de&s;igned to favour any other, than a Re|moval by Writ of Error&mdash;The In&s;truction is in the&s;e Words.</P>

<HEAD>REASONS offered by <HI>Daniel Hor&s;manden,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Chief Ju&s;tice of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to his Honour the Lieutenant Governor and the Honourable His Maje&s;ty's Coun|cil for the &s;aid Province, again&s;t returning an In&s;trument under Seal, whereby all Proceedings on the Verdict lately obtained by the &s;aid <HI>Thomas For&s;ey,</HI> again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Waddel Cunningham</HI> in the Supreme Court, are commanded to be &s;tayed, and ano|ther In&s;trument under Seal, whereby the Ju&s;tices of the &s;aid Supreme Court are commanded to cau&s;e the Proceedings where|on the &s;aid Verdict was founded, to be bro't before tne Lieu|tenant Governor and the Council.</HEAD>
<P>I beg Leave to perfix a State of the Proceedings between the Parties, not only, the more clearly to avail my&s;elf of tho&s;e Rea&s;ons, but al&s;o, in Compliance with my Oath of Office, by which I am bound to certify the King's Maje&s;ty, of the Proceedings, on which tho&s;e In&s;truments (which I con&s;ider as Letters in Delay of Ju&s;tice) are &s;aid to be grounded.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day la&s;t, I brought into this Court tho&s;e Letters, and as both the Prohibition, and Command, appeared to me unwarrantable, I thought it my Duty to obey neither, but to lay the In&s;truments be|fore you, and to a&s;&s;ign my Rea&s;ons, for the Part I acted, on this new, and extraordinary Occa&s;ion. &mdash;The Liberty you gave me to reduce the Sub&s;tance of what I then offered to Writing, as it affords me an Oppor|tunity, to expre&s;s my&s;elf with greater Per&s;picuity, is an Indulgence, for which I return your Honour and the Council my hearty Thanks.</P>
<P>The Suit which occa&s;ioned tho&s;e Letters to the Judges (for they are directed to us all) was an Action of Tre&s;pa&s;s brought in the Supreme Court; in which the Plantiff For&s;ey declared for an A&s;&s;ault, Battery, and wounding, to his Damage &pound;.5000; upon which the Cau&s;e was at i&s;&s;ue on the Plea of not Guilty; and the Jurors in the la&s;t Term of October, found for the Plantiff, and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his Damages at &pound;. 1500.</P>
<P>The Pannel con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;pecial Jury of Freeholders, at the Defendant's Reque&s;t &mdash;No Challenges were made to either of them&mdash; The Trial took up twelve Hours &mdash; No Evidence that was offered, by either Party was refu&s;ed to be admitted by the Court &mdash; All the Judges were upon the Bench &mdash;The Plantiff had three, and the Defendant four Gentlemen attending as their Council &mdash;The Proofs were largely
<PB N="9" REF="041438_0013_101A88D915D18E58">
&s;ummed up on both Sides; and the Bar, and Country, mu&s;t unanimou&s;ly declare, that the Trial was regular, and &s;olemn; and conducted with the utmo&s;t Fairne&s;s and Deliberation.</P>
<P>On the 27&s;t of the Month, tho' the la&s;t Day of the Term, on which no &s;pecial Motions are made, the Council for the Defendant were indul|ged with a Motion for a new Trial. But no Rea&s;on being a&s;&s;igned, but a Complaint that the Damages were exce&s;&s;ive (which did not appear to the Court to be well founded) and the Tre&s;pa&s;s being very atrocious, and the Proofs clear, the Court over-ruled the Motion.</P>
<P>It affords &s;trong Ground of Pre&s;umption that the Proce&s;s and Plead|ings are regular, &s;ince no Writ of Error has been yet offered to us &mdash; The Verdict of the Jury mu&s;t therefore be the &s;ole Cau&s;e of Complaint; and Relief again&s;t that, is now expected from your Honours.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be founded upon an erroneous Interpretation of the thirty &s;econd In&s;truction, given by his Maje&s;ty to the Governor of this Pro|vince: A Con&s;truction which I could not countenance, by an Obe|dience to the Letters &s;ent to me; for the following Rea&s;ons,</P>
<P N="1">I. Becau&s;e it &s;uppo&s;es the Royal Order to aim at altering the antient and whole&s;ome Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>By the common Law of England the Trial of Facts is entru&s;ted to the Jury; and the Power to declare the Law upon them, is committed to the King's Judges&mdash;The&s;e are di&s;tinct Provinces; and the Limits be|tween them guarded by invariable U&s;age and the mo&s;t inconte&s;tible Au|thorities&mdash;The Errors of the Judges may be corrected by &s;uperior Judicatories; as for In&s;tance, tho&s;e of the King's Bench in the Ex|chequer Chamber, and by the Hou&s;e of Peers&mdash;But in all tho&s;e Removes, the Verdict of the Jurors &s;uffers no Re-examination, but is final and deci&s;ive:&mdash;This is the Law at Home.</P>
<P>The Supreme Court here proceeds in the Main, according to the Practice of the Courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and the Common Law of Eng|land, with the Statutes affirming, or altering it, before a Legi&s;lature was e&s;tabli&s;hed here, and tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince &s;uch E&s;tabli&s;hment, ex|pre&s;sly extended to us, with our legi&s;lative Acts (which are not to be repugnant to the Laws of England) con&s;titute the Laws of this Colony: And tho' there are many In&s;tances of Judgments, rever&s;ed and affirmed,
<PB N="10" REF="041438_0014_101A88DBB063E0E0">
in a Cour&s;e of Error, before the Governor and Council, I do affirm, with the highe&s;t Confidence, that not one Verdict was ever re-examined by any &s;uperior Judicatory in the Province.</P>
<P>An Attempt then to re-examine the Verdict of a Jury, is repugnant to the Laws, both of England and this Colony &mdash; This is well known to the Crown;&mdash;and to &s;uppo&s;e that his Maje&s;ty de&s;igned to change the Law, and that too in one of its mo&s;t important Articles, is certainly ab&s;urd, and being dangerous both to the Prerogatives of the Crown and the Liberty and Safety of the Subject; it is in my humble Opinion highly criminal to a&s;&s;ert, that the King's Order has any &s;uch Aim. Nor,</P>
<P N="2">II. Is there any Shadow of Rea&s;on, from the Words of the In&s;truction, to countenance &s;uch a bold Interpretation.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Governor is to permit and allow Appeals from the Courts of common Law; and who can deny, but that in Common Speech, the bringing of a Writ of Error, as it carries the Cau&s;e from a lower to a &s;uperior Tribunal, is an Appeal?&mdash;And &s;urely that mu&s;t be the be&s;t Explication, which &s;atisfies the Term, without altering the Law; e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that the Royal In&s;tructions, given before the Year 1753, adopted that very Term, as applicable to Ca&s;es of Error, the Words of the former In&s;tructions running thus: You are
<Q>to al|low Appeals, in Ca&s;e of Errors, from any of the Courts of Common Law</Q>
and that &s;uch is the meaning of the Appeals mentioned in the pre&s;ent In&s;truction as it is under&s;tood by his Maje&s;ty in Council, will appear from the ca&s;e of <HI>Gordon</HI> &mdash;and <HI>Lowther,</HI> 2d Lord <HI>Raymond</HI> 1447. Add to this that the pre&s;ent In&s;truction, does it&s;elf refute the Interpre|tation upon which this Mea&s;ure is founded; for you'll be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve,
<Q><P N="1">1&s;t. That the Truth is, that all the Appeals we have had (I ex|cept none) have been in Error, and pro&s;ecuted by Writs of Error, and it being his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure that the Governor upon Ap|peals &s;hall
<Q>i&s;&s;ue a Writ in the Manner which has been u&s;ually accu&s;tomed.</Q>
No other Appeal, than by &s;uch Writ, is directed.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Judges of the Supreme Court, though Members of the Council, are forbid to Vote on the Deci&s;ion above:
<PB N="11" REF="041438_0015_101A88DE4449AFD0">
for which I can a&s;&s;ign no other Rea&s;on, than becau&s;e they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have prejudiced the Cau&s;e, e&s;pecially as Leave is neverthele&s;s given them, to render the Rea&s;ons of their Judg|ment, as the Judges do in <HI>England,</HI> upon Error brought before the Peers. And as they are only Judges of the Law and not Triers of the Facts; the&s;e Clau&s;es evidently imply, that the Appeal given, is only in Error, and not upon the Verdict of the Jury.</P></Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, numberle&s;s Objections again&s;t a contrary Con&s;truction may be drawn <HI>ab Inconvenienti,</HI>&mdash;Permit me to mention a few;</P>
<P N="1">I. Who is ignorant that in the Courts of Common Law, the Evidence of the Witne&s;&s;es to the Jury, is all <HI>viva voce?</HI>&mdash; It re&s;ults therefore, that they can tran&s;mit nothing but a Tran&s;cript of the Record, which contains no Part of the Proofs&mdash;The Court above, remains then uninformed of the Facts upon which The Verdict was given, and cannot adjudge upon them with|out a Re-examination of the Witne&s;&s;es, again&s;t that Attempt &s;everal Objections in&s;tantly occur.&mdash;I will hint at but two;
<Q><P N="1">1&s;t. The Cau&s;e mu&s;t be made <HI>Res integra:</HI> For the Want of written Memorials of the fir&s;t Evidence, renders it impo&s;&s;i|ble to confine the Proofs above, to what they were in the fir&s;t Production to the Jury. &mdash; And &s;o the Trouble and Charge of the Trial to the Parties, Court and Country, were all to no Purpo&s;e,&mdash;And,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It tends to open a Flood-Gate to Perjury:&mdash;For both Parties being now appri&s;ed of the Proofs which were &s;ecret 'till the fir&s;t Trial, every Effort will be made to blacken the Character of the mo&s;t material Witne&s;&s;es, and to &s;upply all former Deficiencies.</P>
<P>And from the&s;e Sources &s;uch Streams will flow, as would extort the Groans of all, who delight in the due Admini&s;tra|tion of Ju&s;tice.</P></Q></P>
<P N="2">IIdly. The Appeal contended for, impeaches the Wi&s;dom of our Law in that di&s;tingui&s;hing Article of Trials by Jury; &s;ince all Verdicts in Cau&s;es above the Value of &pound;. 300 Sterling would be wor&s;e than in Vain.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="041438_0016_101A88E30A5ED4B8">IIIdly. It will encourage a Spirit of Litigiou&s;ne&s;s; and introduce Idlene&s;s, to the Ruin of many Families, and the great Impove|ri&s;hment of the Country.</P>
<P N="4">IVthly. The Expence attending &s;uch Appeals will be intolerable&mdash; As the Proofs before the Governor and Council mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be reduced to Writing, to Form what <HI>Civilians</HI> call the <HI>Apo&s;|tella,</HI> for the next Remove of the Cau&s;e to his Maje&s;ty in privy Council; It will follow, that according to their U&s;age, there mu&s;t al&s;o be Interrogatories, cro&s;s Interrogatories, Examinati|ons, and cro&s;s Examinations, and the Production of Exhibits&mdash; And he that is acquainted with the Proce&s;s of the civil Law Courts, will readily agree, that the Evidence introduced on a common Law Trial, of Twelve or Twenty-four Hours, e&s;pecially, when Titles to real E&s;tates are in Que&s;tion, and Deeds offered, will, if reduced to Writing, &s;well the <HI>Apo&s;tels,</HI> to a Size &s;o enormous, that the Trouble and Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, will often &s;urpa&s;s the Value of the Thing in demand. And it may be of U&s;e to ob&s;erve here, (as a farther Proof, that it was not the Object of the In&s;truction, to allow Appeals upon the whole Merits;) that you have not Officers to tran&s;act the Bu&s;ine&s;s, that would thereby be introduced; the Court of the Governor and Council, having neither a Regi&s;ter, nor Examiner, to this Day, appointed by the Crown.</P>
<P N="5">V. It would be impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e Courts of Appeal to di&s;charge the Duty to which they would in &s;uch Ca&s;e be obliged. &mdash; The Governor and Council mu&s;t &s;it <HI>de Die in Diem</HI> all the Year round, for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Colony &mdash; And how then can his Maje&s;ty in privy Council, be&s;ides attending to the arduous Affairs of his Kingdoms, examine all the tedious Complaints brought up from all the Provinces for his Royal Deci&s;ion?</P>
<P N="6">VI. To what an amazing In&s;ecurity and Danger mu&s;t the Subject according to this Project, be reduced and expo&s;ed?</P>
<Q>Let me &s;pecify a few In&s;tances;</Q>
<P N="1">1&s;t. As the Expence, &s;o the Delays, will be infinite&mdash;How great then the Encouragement for Contention? What wrongful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or and de|bauched Tenant, will give up his unju&s;t Defence? What Tre&s;pa&s;&s;er will pay the Damages of an injured Plantiff, when as in this Ca&s;e, the
<PB N="13" REF="041438_0017_101A88E6202C5400">
Death of either Party is the perpetual Extinction, not only of the Suit depending, but the very Cau&s;e of Action? What Lo&s;er will not appeal upon the bear Pre&s;umption that the fir&s;t Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him may be dead, or ab&s;ent, on the new Trial?</P>
<P N="2">2d. Witne&s;&s;es of good and bad Characters, will have, in Effect, equel Credit with the Judges; for they and tho&s;e by who&s;e Te&s;timony they are to be &s;upported, or di&s;credited, will all be unknown by the Judges, who are to pronounce upon their Evidence on Appeal.</P>
<P N="3">3d. New Modes of introducing Proof will nece&s;&s;arily e&s;tabli&s;h new Rules relative to them; and as all &s;pecial Laws, cannot be fore&s;een nor provided for; the Subject will be tried by new Laws, and often by Laws unpromulged; or to &s;peak more properly, by the Dictate of Power without Law.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons which induce me to be of Opinion, that the King's In&s;tructions do not countenance the Exerci&s;e of any Ju|dicial Authority to rever&s;e the Verdict of a Jury: &mdash; And as they give me the fulle&s;t Satisfaction,&mdash;I &s;hall forbear a&s;&s;igning any other, tho' there are many &mdash; The fir&s;t is &s;ufficient for us, who &s;it as Judges &mdash; The Law warrants no &s;uch Letters, as tho&s;e which the Defendant &s;ued out, and delivered to me &mdash; We have taken the Oath, pre&s;cribed by the Statute of the 18 of Ed. 3. and have &s;worn
<Q>to deny no Man common Right, by the King's Letters, nor none other Man's, nor for none other Cau&s;e, but to proceed to execute the Law notwith&s;tanding the &s;ame Letters.</Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, I cannot avoid complaining of the&s;e Let|ters, as an unwarrantable Abu&s;e of the King's Name, and his Judges&mdash; He that &s;ued them out did it at his Peril, and ought to an&s;wer the Contempt.&mdash;They are not only again&s;t Law, but couched in Term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very di&s;re&s;pectful: We are commanded to obey at our Peril; and as an Outrage upon all the Rules of Decorum, one Part of the abject Duty injoined upon us is, to notify the Plantiff, <HI>For&s;ey,</HI> even of the Indignity offered us.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that as the Power of admini&s;tring Ju&s;tice, is one of the mo&s;t important of all Powers, it ought not to be a&s;&s;umed with|out the cleare&s;t Authority&mdash;None of your Predece&s;&s;ors ever heard an Appeal from the Verdict of a Jury&mdash;My long Re&s;idence in the Colony, and Seat on the Bench, and at the Board of Council, have given me Opportunities for &s;ome con&s;iderable Experience; and I know of no

Attempt 'till this, to bring &s;uch an Appeal: And from the Refu&s;al of Coun&s;el to &s;upport the Defendant's Application, you may naturally con|clude, that the whole Body of the Law con&s;ider it as illegal &mdash;Whether a &s;ingle Word in the Royal In&s;tructions will warrant your a&s;&s;uming this great and important Power, I &s;ubmit to your own Deliberations; not doubting but that many Objections will ari&s;e in your own Minds, which have been omitted by me, and might have been &s;ugge&s;ted by my Bro|ther Ju&s;tices, who are now unfortunately all out of Town.</P>

<Q>Ye &s;wear, that you will well and truly execute the Office of a Ju&s;tice of the Supreme Court, according to the be&s;t of your Skill and Under&s;tand|ing. <HI>So help you God.</HI></Q>
<P>But the Chief Ju&s;tice, Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Living&s;ton,</HI> and him&s;elf, being de&s;ired to attend the Governor, to take the Oaths appointed by Law, and receive their Commi&s;&s;ions, and being willing, (if they accepted tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions) not to want any legal Qualification, and to give all the Security to his Maje&s;ty and the People of this Province, which the Law required for the due Execution of the &s;aid Offices, informed Governor MONCKTON, who di&s;liked that general Form, that there was a more exten&s;ive Oath propo&s;ed in the Books, and mentioned the Oath in the

<Q><HI>YE</HI> &s;hall &s;wear, that well and lawfully ye &s;hall &s;erve our LORD the King and his People, in the Office of Ju&s;tice, and that law|fully ye &s;hall coun&s;el the King in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and that ye &s;hall not Coun&s;el nor a&s;&s;ent to any Thing which may turn him in Damage or Di&s;heri&s;on by any Manner, Way, or Colour, and that ye &s;hall not know the Damage or Di&s;heri&s;on of him, whereof ye &s;hall not cau&s;e him to be warned by your&s;elf, or by other; and that ye &s;hall do equal Law and Execution of Right to all his Subjects, rich and poor, without having Regard to any Per&s;on; And that you take not by your&s;elf, or by other, pri|vily, nor apertly, Gift, nor Reward, of Gold nor Silver, nor of any other Thing which may turn to your Profit, unle&s;s it be Meat or Drink, and that of &s;mall Value, of any Man that &s;hall have any Plea or Proce&s;s hanging before you, as long as the &s;ame Proce&s;s &s;hall &s;o be hanging, nor after, for the &s;ame Cau&s;e; and that ye take no Fee, as long as ye &s;hall be Ju&s;tice, nor Robes of any Man, great or &s;mall, but of the King him&s;elf; and that ye give none Advice, nor Coun&s;el to no Man, great nor &s;mall, in no Ca&s;e where the King is Party; And in Ca&s;e that any of what E&s;tate or Condition they be, come before you in your Se&s;&s;ions with Force and Arms, or otherwi&s;e, again&s;t the Peace, or again&s;t the Form of the Statute thereof made, to di&s;turb Execution of the common Law, or to menace the People, that they may not pur&s;ue the Law, that ye &s;hall cau&s;e their Bodies to be arre&s;ted and put in Pri&s;on; and in Ca&s;e they be &s;uch that ye cannot arre&s;t them, that ye certify the King of their Names, and of their Mispri&s;ion ha&s;tily, &s;o that he may thereof ordain a conve|nable Remedy; And that ye by your&s;elf, nor by other, privily nor apertly maintain any Plea or Quarrel hanging in the King's Court, or el&s;ewhere in the Country, <HI>And that you deny to no Man common Right, by the

King's Letters,</HI> nor none other Man's, nor for none other Cau&s;e, <HI>and in Ca&s;e any Letters come to you contrary to the Law, that ye do nothing by &s;uch Letters,</HI> but certify the King thereof; and <HI>proceed to execute the Law&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the &s;ame Letters;</HI> and that ye &s;hall do and procure the Profit of the King and of his Crown, with all Things where ye may rea&s;onably do the &s;ame; and in Ca&s;e ye be from henceforth found in Default in any of the Points afore&s;aid, ye &s;hall be at the King's Will, of Body, Lands and Goods, thereof to be done as &s;hall plea&s;e him.</Q>
<P>Upon which, it being ob&s;erved by the Court, that the &s;aid Oath was very exten&s;ive and &s;olemn, the &s;aid Ju&s;tice &s;aid <HI>it is &s;o,</HI> and that le&s;t thro' Surpri&s;e or Forgetfulne&s;s he might deviate from it, he found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary frequently to read it, e&s;pecially before the holding the Supreme Court, and on the Circuits; and ob&s;erved, that as his Oath of Office, as well as his Commi&s;&s;ion, re&s;pected only the common Law and its Pro|ceedings, and could not admit him, by any po&s;&s;ible Con&s;truction, to decide or determine by any other Law; and as the common Law knew not of any &s;uch Appeal from a Verdict to any other Court than that wherein it was taken, he held him&s;elf obliged by his Oath, to refu&s;e any Entry of the Appeal from the Verdict as offered, and that if he had al|lowed that Appeal, he &s;hould have acted not only without Authority, but contrary to his Oath; for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, he could not allow the Appeal as offered, and which he hoped would appear to be a full An|&s;wer to this Que&s;tion; adding therewith, if he had &s;at in a Court of Ad|miralty, or any Court from whence Appeals are allowed to a &s;uperior Juri&s;diction, he &s;hould doubtle&s;s upon Motion, have allowed them ac|cording to the Law and Practice of &s;uch Courts.</P></Q>
<P>After which, the &s;aid Ju&s;tice was de&s;ired to give the Rea&s;ons of his Conduct, with Regard to the Writs referred to in the Que&s;tion propo&s;ed on the 19th of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>To which he an&s;wered:</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>As to the fir&s;t Writ directed to the Chief Ju&s;tice, and other Judges of his Maje&s;ty's Supreme Court,
<Q>commanding them, and every of them, wholly to forbear Proceeding, or taking any Step further again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> on the &s;aid Verdict, until the Cau&s;e and Merits thereof be heard before the Governor and Council, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="041438_0025_101A88FB38E78528">The &s;aid Ju&s;tice acknowledged that he had been duly &s;erved with that Writ, and had compared the Copy thereof with the Original at the Time of Service; but as there had been no Application made to him in that &s;aid Cau&s;e, to do any Thing in Con&s;equence of the &s;aid Verdict, &s;ince the Service of the &s;aid Writ, he had done nothing in it; but according to what he had heard, it was likely that the Validity or Legality of that Writ would come into Que&s;tion in the Supreme Court; therefore, he was in their Honours Opinion, whether it would be proper that at pre|&s;ent he &s;u&s;pend his Judgment on that Point, as extrajudicial Opinions ought to be given very &s;paringly, and with great Caution, if at all, le&s;t in Con&s;equence of &s;uch Opinion, Suits &s;hould be promoted, Mainte|nance encouraged, and the Judgment of the Ju&s;tice him&s;elf fore&s;talled, and the Public otherwi&s;e receive &s;ome Damage.</P>
<P>However, if the Court in&s;i&s;ted upon his giving an Opinion on the Legality of that Writ, he was ready to give it: To which the Court agreed, that the Rea&s;on offered was &s;ufficient, why any Opinion at pre|&s;ent on that Writ, &s;hould not be de&s;ired.</P></Q>
<P>And then as to the &s;econd Writ, reciting the former, and
<Q>Commanding the Chief Ju&s;tice, and other the Judges of the Supreme Court, that they cau&s;e all and every the Proceedings again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> whether by Bill, Plaint, or otherwi&s;e, whereon the &s;aid Verdict was obtained, to be brought before the Governor and Coun|cil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<Q>The &s;aid Ju&s;tice declared, that he had not been &s;erved with that Writ, and had only a Copy of it delivered to him; but under&s;tood that the Writ had been delivered to the Chief Ju&s;tice, to whom Returns on Writs of Error do properly belong; and as that Honourable Board had heard the Chief Ju&s;tice's Rea&s;ons, why he did not make any Return of the Proceedings of the Supreme Court on that Writ, he al&s;o was in their Opinion, whether it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to give his own Opinion concerning that Writ; but this <HI>al&s;o</HI> at pre&s;ent was not de&s;ired.</Q>
<DIV4 TYPE="document">
<P>Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Living&s;ton</HI> then delivered his Rea&s;ons in Writing, which were ordered to be entered, and are as follow:</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>BEING de&s;ired by your Honours, to give you the Rea&s;ons of my Conduct, in refu&s;ing to return two In&s;truments under Seal, di|rected to the Chief Ju&s;tice, and the other Judges of the Supreme Court;
<PB N="22" REF="041438_0026_101A88FCD3B0EC90">
by one of which, all Proceedings on a Verdict obtained by <HI>Thomas For&s;ey,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> are commanded to be &s;tayed; and by the other, for the more fully enabling the Governor and Council to de|termine the Matter of the &s;aid Verdict; we are further commanded, as we will an&s;wer the &s;ame at our Peril, to Cau&s;e all the Proceedings again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> to be brought before the Governor and Council.</P>
<P>I beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that my Conduct might ea&s;ily be ju&s;tified, by &s;hewing that I had no Notice of tho&s;e Letters, till the Chief Ju&s;tice had refu&s;ed to return them, after which no legal Return could be made, for a Writ mu&s;t ever be returned by tho&s;e to whom it is directed. But be|cau&s;e I believe your Honours, in the Reque&s;t you made us, did not in|tend &s;o much to call upon us for a Ju&s;tification of our Conduct, as to receive the Opinion of the Judges in an Affair of the greate&s;t Impor|tance, and to be informed whether in our Explanation of the In&s;truction on which tho&s;e In&s;truments &s;eem to be founded, we agree with the Chief Ju&s;tice; I &s;hall with the greate&s;t Willingne&s;s endeavour to an&s;wer your Expectations.&mdash;Had the Chief Ju&s;tice in the lea&s;t doubted in what Manner he ought to have acted on the Receipt of the&s;e In&s;truments, he would have waited till the Return of the other Judges out of the Coun|try permitted a Con&s;ultation; but he thought, and it is by what I can learn the Opinion of every one of us, that the Ca&s;e admitted no Di&s;|pute.</P>
<P>For it is evident, that the Cour&s;e of the Law, by which the Prero|gatives of the Crown, and the Rights of the Subject, are defined and &s;ecured, mu&s;t at all Times be free and uninterrupted; and this is &s;o parti|cularly provided for, that by the Oath we have taken, we are to deny no Man Right by the King's Letters, nor none other Man's, but to proceed notwith&s;tanding &s;uch Letters. This was not intended however, to prevent the &s;taying of Execution after Judgment, by Writs of Error; for the Correction of Errors is not a Delay, but a Furtherance of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t In&s;trument appears to me, a very great Abu&s;e of the King's Name and Authority. It commands us in Terms very di&s;|re&s;pectful, and not &s;uch as are u&s;ual in Writs directed to us, wholly to forbear Proceeding or taking any further Step again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> on the Verdict obtained again&s;t him. The Illegality of which will appear from the&s;e three Ob&s;ervations.</P></Q>
<P N="1"><PB N="23" REF="041438_0027_101A890082455C20">1&s;t. It commands us not to do that, which the Law, our Duty, and common Ju&s;tice to the Parties, oblige us to do; for had a Writ of Error been brought, we &s;hould have &s;till been obliged to proceed to Judgment, and the &s;igning of the Roll: And tho' it is allowable to bring Writs of Error before Judgment, this being the common Practice to prevent Execution, yet the Writ has no Effect till after Judgment; before that, the Party having received no Injury.</P>
<P N="2">2dly We are to forbear till the Merits of the Verdict are heard be|fore y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Honours; but the Roll being with us, and no proper Method being taken to bring the Cau&s;e before you; this Prohibition might for any Thing which could appear to the Judges, have been perpetual, to the great Grievance of the Party concerned, and the Delay of Ju&s;tice. Therefore the Chief Ju&s;tice could not have refu&s;ed to &s;ign the Roll when it was required, notwith&s;tanding this Prohibition.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Your Honours are incompetent Judges of the Merits of the Verdict, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to inform you of the Grounds on which the Jury founded it, &s;ince they &s;ometimes are guided by what they know of their own Knowledge; e&s;pecially in what relates to the Characters of the Witne&s;&s;es, of which they coming from the Neighbourhood, are the mo&s;t proper Judges.</P>
<P><Q>The other In&s;trument, as well as the fir&s;t, is directed "to our Chief Ju&s;tice, and the other Judges of our Supreme Court, and to all the other Officers of our &s;aid Court, whom it may concern;</Q>
&s;o that if we had made the Return required, we mu&s;t have joined with all the Officers of the Court, or the Return would not have been good: Whe|ther this be fit or decent, I leave to your Honour's Con&s;ideration.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>But waving the Defects of Form, of which there are many others, I &s;hall ob&s;erve on the Purport and De&s;ign of this In&s;trument, and &s;hew that it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to make &s;uch a Return as &s;eems to be re|quired. Previous to which, I &s;hall make a few Ob&s;ervations on the In&s;truction on which it is founded.</P>
<P>The Intention of this In&s;truction appears to me no more than a Direction to your Honours, when you &s;hould &s;uffer a Writ of Error to be brought, and when you are to di&s;mi&s;s the Cau&s;e. I have frequently read this In&s;truction on this Occa&s;ion, and it amazes me to find that any
<PB N="24" REF="041438_0028_101A890301FBBC78">
Per&s;on &s;hould think it liable to a different Explanation. What gives Ri&s;e to the Con&s;truction on which the&s;e In&s;truments are founded, is the frequent U&s;e of the Word <HI>Appeal</HI>; but how &s;lender a Foundation this is, mu&s;t appear from the In&s;tructions before the Year 1753, quoted by his Honour the Chief Ju&s;tice, which direct that you &s;hall allow Appeals in Ca&s;es of Error from the Courts of Law; where the Word <HI>Appeal</HI> means nothing el&s;e but Writs of Error; and accordingly on all &s;uch Appeals, Writs of Error have been brought. &mdash; After this comes the In&s;truction in Que&s;tion, and &s;ays, you &s;hall allow Appeals from the Courts of common Law, only in &s;ome certain Ca&s;es, <HI>to wit,</HI> When the Value of the Thing appealed for exceeds the Sum of <HI>Three Hundred Pounds Sterling.</HI> What can this mean, but &s;uch an Appeal as was meant by the former In&s;truction? and in this Sen&s;e it &s;eems to have been under&s;tood by your Honours; other|wi&s;e you would not have &s;uffered it to be made a Que&s;tion, whether you ought to take Cognizance of a Cau&s;e brought before you by Writ of Error, when the only Objection was, that the Thing appealed for, did not amount to <HI>Three Hundred Pounds Sterling</HI>: An In&s;tance of this Kind I was Witne&s;s to la&s;t <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI>; for if the In&s;truction mu&s;t be under|&s;tood to relate to Appeals in the civil Law Form, Writs of Error would have &s;tood upon the &s;ame Footing they did before this In&s;truction was given. In this Explanation and Acceptation of the Word, your Honours are ju&s;tified by the U&s;e of it in common Parlance, and tho' this be not frequent among Lawyers, yet it is &s;ome times &s;o u&s;ed. Dr. <HI>Cowel</HI> in his <HI>Interpretor,</HI> on the Word <HI>Appeal,</HI> &s;ays it is u&s;ed in the com|mon, as in the civil Law, to &s;ignify the Removal of a Cau&s;e from an Inferior Judge to a Superior; and his Honour the Chief Ju&s;tice has &s;hewn you that it was &s;o under&s;tood by the King in Council. &mdash; The Truth is, both in the civil and in the common Law, the Word is u&s;ed in the&s;e two Sen&s;es, to &s;ignify an Accu&s;ation, and an Appeal from a Judgment, but as in the common Law, (which is more particular in it's Di&s;tinctions than any other) there are four Methods of Appeal from a Judgment, <HI>to wit,</HI> By Writ of Error, Writ of fal&s;e Judgment, Writ of Attaint, and <HI>Audita querela,</HI> and as the&s;e have but little Similiarity with each other, &s;o that the Law which regards the one, rarely affects the other, Lawyers have &s;eldom Occa&s;ion to u&s;e the Word, which &s;igni|fies the Genus, but &s;peak generally of one or other of the Species; and the Word <HI>Appeal</HI> is appropriated to &s;ignify a particular Accu&s;ation. But as it is very probable that this In&s;truction was not drawn by a Lawyer, and we know it was given for the Direction Gentlemen not much
<PB N="25" REF="041438_0029_101A8904EC8337C8">
ver&s;ed in Law Terms; it is very probable that it is here u&s;ed, in the common Acceptation of the Word, to &s;ignify any Removal of a Cau&s;e, from one Court to another; and this with more Propriety, as it may in|tend to include two of the Species above mentioned, a Writ of Error, and a Writ of fal&s;e Judgment; the latter of which is a Remedy again&s;t an erroneous Judgment, in a Court not of Record.</P>
<P>This being the plain Meaning, and certainly the mo&s;t legal Expla|nation of this In&s;truction, a Writ of Error &s;hould have been &s;ent, and then your Honours would have had the Record before you: By the In&s;truction you are to &s;end the u&s;ual Writ, and we as Judges dare not obey any other than &s;uch as are warranted by Law. All Others we mu&s;t look upon as Letters contrived to delay or ob&s;truct the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, what Remedy &s;hall the Party have, who is aggrieved by an unju&s;t Verdict, or an Error in Fact.&mdash;To which the An&s;wer is, he may have a Writ of Error, to try the Fact in the &s;ame Court; or he may have his Writ of Attaint, or according to the u&s;ual Practice, move the Court for a new Trial; or he may have his <HI>Audita querela</HI>: All which are competent Remedies according to the Nature of the Ca&s;e, without carrying the Matter before another Judicatory: Be|cau&s;e, the Judges are not concerned in any Errors in Fact, but &s;uch as may be made Part of the Record by a Bill of Exceptions, if the Party plea&s;es, and con&s;equently they &s;till remain indifferent, and therefore an Appeal from their Judgment is unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But what makes it evident, that the King did not intend by the above In&s;truction to alter the Law, and the Methods of Proceeding in the Supreme Court is this, The In&s;truction is not directed to the Judges of that Court, and therefore was not intended to regulate their Conduct: They mu&s;t &s;till determine and act according to Law, and nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to &s;uppo&s;e, that they mu&s;t have Recour&s;e to a Go|vernor's In&s;tructions, to &s;pell out their Duty from &s;uch Scraps of them as he &s;hall think proper to communicate. Further, it is evident, that Writs of Error were only meant by this In&s;truction.</P></Q>
<P N="1">I. Becau&s;e it directs the Governor to i&s;&s;ue a Writ in the Manner which has been u&s;ually accu&s;tomed, and this is the u&s;ual Writ, and no other has been u&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="26" REF="041438_0030_101A890949096E48">II. This will bring up all that the Ju&s;tices of the Supreme Court can &s;end, and therefore any other Writ mu&s;t be u&s;ele&s;s. Nothing el&s;e is in our Power at pre&s;ent, but the Record, and <HI>that</HI> we are ready to &s;end as &s;oon as it is properly demanded. In civil Law Courts, the Evidence is reduced to Writing, and therefore, upon an Appeal, may be tran&s;|mitted. But &s;end to us as many Letters as you plea&s;e, and let them contain Terms &s;till more menacing than tho&s;e &s;ent us upon this Occa&s;ion, if the Law did not fully ju&s;tify us in our Refu&s;al to return them, our Excu&s;e would be <HI>Nil dat, quod non habet.</HI> The Evidence went to the Jury, mo&s;t of it was delivered <HI>viva voce,</HI> and it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to retain it in our Memories: Should we make Records of all that was &s;aid by each Witne&s;s, in every Trial, the Labour would be endle&s;s, and the whole Year would not &s;uffice for the Trial of the Cau&s;es which yearly ari&s;e, tho' the Court &s;hould &s;it every Day, and the Country be obliged to a perpetual Attendance.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>But as the Chief Ju&s;tice has &s;ufficiently &s;hewn the Inconveniencies which mu&s;t attend this new Practice; I &s;hall not enlarge on them, tho' many others might be mentioned that would re&s;ult from altering the Law, in &s;o e&s;&s;ential a Point as Trials by Juries.</P>
<P>I have as much as po&s;&s;ible in giving your Honours the&s;e Rea&s;ons for my Conduct, avoided &s;aying any Thing the Chief Ju&s;tice has already ob&s;erved; becau&s;e I would not tre&s;pa&s;s on your Patience, by an unnece&s;|&s;ary Repetition. But he has been &s;o copious, and has treated the Matter &s;o well, that I have not been able to avoid &s;liding into &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, it appears to me a very un&s;afe Interpretation of this In&s;truction, to &s;ay, that his Maje&s;ty de&s;igned by it to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a Court, as has been altogether unknown to <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> &s;ince the glo|rious Revolution. That he intended (except in Cau&s;es thought too trifling to admit of an Appeal) to deprive his Subjects in this Colony of their indi&s;putable Right to Trials by Juries, one of the mo&s;t antient Privileges of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> confirmed to them by the great Charter, e&s;|&s;ential to, and the grand <HI>Palladium</HI> of their Liberties.</P>
<P>Such a Suppo&s;ition would be extremely injurious to his Maje&s;ty, and the Memory of his Royal Grandfather, in who&s;e Time this In&s;truc|tion was fir&s;t given, e&s;pecially as the Monarchs of the illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of Hanover, could never be ju&s;tly charged with taking a &s;ingle Step towards infringing the Liberties of their People.</P></Q>

<PB N="28" REF="041438_0032_101A890D349618E0">
in all my reading, on the Laws and Con&s;titution of <HI>England,</HI> I cannot recollect that I have ever met with any Thing in Favour of &s;uch an Ap|peal. On the Contrary, the known Rule is, <HI>ad Quae&s;tionem Juris re&s;|pondent Judices, ad Quae&s;tionem Facti re&s;pondent Juratores.</HI> The Book intitled <HI>The Law of Errors,</HI> P. 4, &s;ays, it is a known Rule in our Books,
<Q>a Judgment being once given in <HI>Curia Domini Regis,</HI> ought not to be rever&s;ed, nor avoided but by Error, or Attaint, for all Matters of Fact at common Law, are decided by a Jury of Twelve Men, again&s;t whom if they err in their Judgment, the Party grieved may bring Attaint.</Q>
The Writ of Attaint lay originally at com|mon Law, and is affirmed with &s;ome Alterations by the Statute of the 23d of HENRY the Eighth, C. the 3d; and in <HI>Wood</HI>'s In&s;titute of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> P. 637, is thus de&s;cribed;
<Q>A Writ of Attaint lies again&s;t a Jury, and is to examine whether a Jury of twelve Men gave a fal&s;e Verdict, or contrary to Evidence, in a Court of Record upon I&s;&s;ue joined: That upon Conviction of the Jury, the Judgment following upon it may be rever&s;ed.</Q>
This appears to me to be the only Method formerly u&s;ed to &s;et a&s;ide or avoid the Verdict of a Jury; but as <HI>Wood</HI> &s;ays, in the &s;ame Place, is now almo&s;t out of U&s;e; and in|&s;tead thereof, Motions are u&s;ually made for new Trials when a Verdict is given contrary to Evidence; which &s;eems to be the pre&s;ent Practice in the Courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and is the Practice of the Supreme Court here: In removing a Cau&s;e from one Court to another for Matter of Error, the common Method I take to be by Writ of Error, tho' &s;ometimes by <HI>Certiorari,</HI> and the Proceedings on &s;uch Writs, are in Relation to the Errors of the Judges, in Matters of Law; and are not to have Re&s;pect to the Verdict of the Jury, as appears to me from the Statute of the 27th of ELIZABETH, C. 8th, how erroneous Judgments in the King's Bench, upon certain per&s;onal Actions may be redre&s;&s;ed; where Verdicts are expre&s;sly excepted&middot; &mdash; I therefore give it as my Opi|nion, that according to the Laws and Con&s;titution of <HI>England,</HI> the Ap|peal mentioned in the Que&s;tion could not lie.</P>

<P>HIS Honour the Lieutenant Governor required the Opinion of the Council on the following Que&s;tion.</P>
<P><Q>Whether by the 32d In&s;truction, the King has directed his Gover|nor to permit and allow Appeals in all civil Cau&s;es, from the Courts

of common Law within this Province; and whether his Maje&s;ty has by the &s;ame In&s;truction, directed his Governor and Council to hear and determine &s;uch Appeals?</Q></P>
<P>Whereupon the Council declared, that as the King's Judges, and the mo&s;t able Council in the Law in the Province, have given their Opinion, that no other than an Appeal on <HI>Error,</HI> can lie by this In&s;truction; they are unanimou&s;ly of Opinion, no other Appeal than on <HI>Error,</HI> is the Intention or Meaning of the Crown by this In&s;truction, and that they cannot take Cognizance of any other Appeal.</P>
<P>His Honour the Lieutenant Governor declared his Di&s;&s;ent from the &s;aid Opinion, and &s;ignified he would give his Rea&s;ons for &s;uch his Di&s;&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Whereupon a Motion was made, that the Rea&s;ons offered by the Council in this Cau&s;e, on Wedne&s;day la&s;t, &s;hould be entered, which were ordered to be entered accordingly, and are in the Words following:</P>

<HEAD><HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> Claiming to be Appellant again&s;t <HI>Thomas For&s;ey.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty's Council for the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> as con&s;tituting with the Go|vernor or Commander in Chief for the Time being, the Court e&s;tabli&s;hed by his Maje&s;ty's royal Predece&s;&s;ors, and referred to in his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's 32d In&s;truction; conceiving it to be a Que&s;tion of the utmo&s;t Importance, whether by Virtue of that, or any precedent royal In&s;truction, they are authorized in Conjunction with his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, to hold Cog|nizance of this Cau&s;e, on an Appeal upon the Merits, from the Verdict of a Jury?</P>
<P>On this momentous Topic, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Coun|cil, have taken the utmo&s;t Pains to form a Judgment, by which Ju&s;tice may be di&s;tributed to the Subject, con&s;i&s;tent with the known and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Laws of the Land, and the true Sen&s;e and Meaning of the royal In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>In this Veiw, as it is a Ca&s;e of the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion, the Court unani|mou&s;ly called upon the Judges of the Supreme Court, and &s;everal Coun|&s;el of the be&s;t Reputation in their Profe&s;&s;ion, who have all concurred in Opinion, that we are not authorized either by Law or by any of the
<PB N="31" REF="041438_0035_101A8915E9901B30">
royal In&s;tructions, in &s;everal In&s;tances &s;o evidently grounded on the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> to hold juri&s;diction of this Cau&s;e, as it is now brought be|fore us. The Court has be&s;ides tho&s;e Aids, given every Advantage to a Point of &s;o great Moment, which the mo&s;t mature Con&s;ideration could afford: And that it may appear upon what Rea&s;ons his Maje&s;ty's Coun|cil have the Unhappine&s;s to differ in Opinion from his Honour the Lieu|tenant Governor, they beg Leave to con&s;ider the Rea&s;ons urged by him in Favour of the Appeal, as it is now brought before us; and to &s;ubjoin &s;uch An&s;wers to tho&s;e Rea&s;ons, as it is conceived the Law will warrant.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Council humbly hope, that they cannot better Recom|mend them&s;elves to his royal Approbation, than by making the Law of the Land the Rule of their Conduct, in the Execution of every Part of the important Tru&s;t committed to them; and flatter them&s;elves, that their Di&s;&s;ention in Sentiment from his Honour, as it is founded on the cleare&s;t Law, will be a full Demon&s;tration of their Fidelity to the be&s;t of Princes.</P>
<P>In this material Divi&s;ion in the Sentiments of this Court; his Ma|je&s;ty's Council are of Opinion, that his Honour's Rea&s;ons will, if lite|rally incorporated into this their An&s;wer, appear in a View, the mo&s;t advantageous of which they are capable: And as we with the utmo&s;t Willingne&s;s &s;ubmit the Rea&s;ons of our Judgment to the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who by Law are inve&s;ted with a Power to correct our Errors, and controul our Determinations, we flatter our&s;elves that his Honour would not decline the &s;ame Tribunal; and as we pre&s;ume the Law mu&s;t at la&s;t determine upon this Difference, &s;o al&s;o we conceive that &s;uch Determination can be&s;t be made upon a fair State of the Contra&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Pur&s;uit of this Method, his Honour's Rea&s;ons will be reduced into as many different Paragraphs, as their Subject Matter naturally dictates; to each of which his Maje&s;ty's Council will offer &s;uch An|&s;wers, as their Duty to their Prince, and the Laws of the Land clearly and undeniably &s;ugge&s;t. The fir&s;t Paragraph is as follows:</P>
<Q>An Error I conceive runs thro' all the Arguments I have heard on this Subject, in not di&s;tingui&s;hing between the Laws and the Execution of them: The executory judicial Powers are certainly in the Crown: The King is the Fountain of Ju&s;tice: The Power of erecting Courts of Ju&s;tice is con&s;equently in the Crown. The King may give them
<PB N="32" REF="041438_0036_101A891954C01688">
&s;uch Modes of Proceeding, &s;uch Extent of Authority and Juri&s;diction, as he thinks mo&s;t proper for obtaining Ju&s;tice, in the Countries where &s;uch Courts are erected, &s;uited to the Circum&s;tance of the Country; and it may be done without the lea&s;t Alteration of the Law, by which &s;uch Courts mu&s;t Judge. This is evident in our Colonies; every Colony has different Courts and Modes of Proceeding from tho&s;e in other Colonies; and all of them different from the Courts in <HI>England</HI>; yet the &s;ame common Law has its full Force in all of them.</Q>
<P><HI>In An&s;wer to this we ob&s;erve:</HI></P>
<P>That we think the Di&s;tinction which his Honour &s;uppo&s;es between the Laws and the Execution of them, in the Sen&s;e urged in his Rer&s;ons, is groundle&s;s. For tho' we agree with him, that the Law mu&s;t e&s;&s;enti|ally and unalterably be the &s;ame, unle&s;s changed by legi&s;lative Act, (which the Di&s;tinction taken by him nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es) and that judi|cial Powers are in Suppo&s;ition of Law in the Crown, that the King is the Fountain of Ju&s;tice, and the Power of erecting Courts is in the Crown: Yet we beg Leave to deny his Inference, that the King may give them &s;uch Modes of Proceeding, &s;uch Extent of Authority and Juri&s;diction as he thinks proper, as well as that &s;uch Modes may be introduced as have hitherto been unknown, without the lea&s;t Alteration of the Law, by which &s;uch Court mu&s;t Judge.</P>
<P>For, 1&s;t, we conceive that tho' the Crown has Authority to erect and con&s;titute Courts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>6</HI> Rep. <HI>11.</HI>&mdash;Wood's In&s;t. <HI>447.</HI> Vin. tit. Prerogative, P. <HI>561,</HI> No. <HI>8.</HI></NOTE> yet every Court mu&s;t have &s;uch a Juri&s;diction, and mu&s;t be &s;o modelled in its e&s;&s;ential Parts, as to have a known and common Law Juri&s;|diction.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Wherever &s;uch new modelled Courts are e&s;&s;entially different from tho&s;e known in the Law, the Law mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily and of Cour&s;e be altered; as the Maxim wi&s;ely &s;peaks, <HI>Mutata Forma prope intere|mitur Sub&s;tantia rei</HI>; for In&s;tance, were the Lieutenant Governor's Sup|po&s;ition ju&s;t, that his Maje&s;ty's 32d In&s;truction did intend that this Court as a Court of Appeals, &s;hould have Cognizance of Matters of Fact, already &s;ettled and determined by a Jury, it would alter the Law in the grand and e&s;&s;ential Point of Trials by Juries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law Er. <HI>4.</HI>&mdash;Cro. Ja. <HI>335, 336</HI>&mdash;Trials per pais, <HI>6</HI>th Ed. <HI>227, 228.</HI> Vaug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|an <HI>148, 149.</HI></NOTE> who&s;e Verdicts by the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> are the only Means by which Facts can be determined, and would amount to a Rever&s;al of the common Law

Maxim, <HI>ad Quae&s;tionem Juris re&s;pondet Judices, ad Quae&s;tionem Facti re|&s;pondent Juratores.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. Tho' different Methods of Proceeding in the different Colo|nies, are rather a&s;&s;umed by them than warranted by Law, and yet the principal Difference between them is perhaps in Matters of Form, (in which all the various Courts of Law in <HI>England</HI> do al&s;o differ); but the e&s;&s;ential Parts of every common Law Court, <HI>to wit,</HI> a Jury to determine the Facts, and Judges to &s;peak the Law, are to be found, in all the Courts of Law of every Colony.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>His Honour in the next Paragraph ob&s;erves, that <Q>In all the Colonies Appeals to the King lie &mdash; this is e&s;&s;ential to the Preroga|tive of the Crown, without which the Dependence of the Colonies cannot be pre&s;erved. The pre&s;erving the Dependence of all the Dominions of the Crown, the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> evidently had in View, in the Act of the 6th of GEORGE the 1&s;t. <HI>for the bet|ter &s;ecuring the Dependency of Ireland</HI>; but as this Matter is of great Importance, I &s;hall con&s;ider it more di&s;tinctly.</Q></P></Q>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Council ob&s;erve on this Paragraph, that the Word Appeal is u&s;ed without &s;ettling its Definition: If by it is intended an Appeal upon Matters of Fact, they cannot help ob&s;erving it is a <HI>Petitio Principii.</HI> That in all the Colonies an Appeal in the confined Sen&s;e of the Word (and in the only proper Sen&s;e in which it is known in the Law of <HI>England, to wit,</HI> from the Judgment of the Judges in Matters of Law, will lie to the King as pre&s;ent in Suppo&s;ion of Law) in all his Courts, cannot be doubted. And in this Sen&s;e an Appeal is clearly both e&s;&s;ential to the Prerogative of the Crown, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for maintaining the Dependence of the Colonies, as the inferior upon <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as the Superior Dominion; and the&s;e indeed are the only Rea&s;ons why an Appeal in any Sen&s;e of the Word will lie. For thus the greate&s;t Lawyers rea&s;on on the Subject.</P>
<P>As &s;uch Dominions are not Parcel of, but Dominions dependent on <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> no remedial Writs between Subject and Subject will lie, from the &s;uperior to the inferior Dominion; as they do from the Courts of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to any of the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> except Writs of Error. But if the Errors of Judges in the dependent Dominion might not be corrected by &s;ome Judicatory in the Kingdom on which it de|pends, the&s;e Con&s;equences would follow, <HI>to wit.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="34" REF="041438_0038_101A891D7AF69AC0">1&s;t. That the Law appointed or permitted to &s;uch inferior Dominion, might be in&s;en&s;ibly changed within it&s;elf, without the A&s;&s;ent of the Do|minion &s;uperior.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That Judgments might be then given to the Di&s;advantage or le&s;&s;ening of the Superiority; which cannot be rea&s;onable: and to make the Superiority to be only of the King, but not of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as King <HI>James</HI> once would have it in a Ca&s;e concerning <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that Writs of Error into all Domini|ons belonging to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> upon the ultimate Judgments there given into the King's Courts of <HI>England,</HI> to rever&s;e or affirm Judgments, are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport a Dependence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vaughan's Repo.</HI> 401.402.</NOTE> and are the only Writs that lie concerning Property between Subject and Subject.</P>
<P>But that Appeals upon Matters of Fact, are not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the Dependence in Que&s;tion, is obvious at fir&s;t View, for whether a Que&s;tion of Fact be determined between Subject and Subject, either in the Affirmative or Negative, cannot po&s;&s;ibly affect &s;uch Dependence.</P>
<P>As to the Statute for &s;ecuring the Dependence of <HI>Ireland,</HI> we cannot conceive how his Honour &s;hould think of applying it to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; for,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It contains not a &s;ingle Word in Relation to the Colonies, and therefore we cannot &s;ee the Propriety of the A&s;&s;ertion, that in the pa&s;&s;ing of that Act, the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> had in View the pre&s;erving the Dependence of <HI>all</HI> the Dominions of the Crown.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That Act as far as it provides for &s;ecuring the Dependence of <HI>Ireland,</HI> directs nothing more than that the Hou&s;e of Lords in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;hall not have any Juri&s;diction to judge, affirm or rever&s;e, any Judgment, Sentence, or Decree, made or given there, or in other Words, that they were not a Court of Appeals, either in Law or Equity. The Statute therefore cannot be under&s;tood to have intended a Change or Alteration in the Law, by giving the Subject in <HI>Ireland</HI> a Right of appealing from the Verdict of a Jury. In the next Paragraph his Honour ob&s;erves, that,</P>
<P><Q>By the Word Appeal in Law is meant the removing the Cau&s;e from an inferior to a &s;uperior Judicatory: By Writ of Error the Cau&s;e is
<PB N="35" REF="041438_0039_101A891F1D396E18">
not removed, but &s;ome di&s;puted Points in Law are determined, and which may have no Relation to the Merits of the Cau&s;e. &mdash; Appeals to the King in Per&s;on were by the common Law, both before and after the Conque&s;t, and are confirmed by <HI>Magna Charta, nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, nec deferemus Ju&s;titiam,</HI> relates e&s;pecially to Appeals, in which the King was Judge; for to &s;ell, deny, or de|lay Ju&s;tice, can have no reference to any Per&s;on, other than a Judge: The Complaint was, that large Sums of Money were demanded for Writs of Appeal, and at other Times they were denied or delayed. To remedy the&s;e Complaints, this Clau&s;e was made Part of the great Charter; thereby the Subject's Right to Appeals is confirmed, not taken away.</Q></P>
<P>We agree with the Lieutenant Governor, that by an Appeal in Law, is meant the Removal of a Cau&s;e from an inferior to a &s;uperior Judica|tory.</P>
<P>But in Oppo&s;ition to his Opinion, we beg Leave to &s;hew in a few Words, that by Writ of Error the Cau&s;e and its Merits are removed, for the Record it&s;elf which contains the whole Pleadings between the Par|ties, the I&s;&s;ue, the Verdict, and the Judgment is removed; and the Er|rors e&s;&s;ential in the Law in either Part of the Record are corrected, and the Judgment in the Whole is either rever&s;ed or affirmed.&mdash;Thus then the Merits in Law ari&s;ing from the Matters of Fact, contained in the Record, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily receive their Determination in a Court of Er|rors; nor can it ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that con&s;titutional Courts have been erected with Power to lay their Hands on the Proceedings in a Cau&s;e only to furni&s;h an Opportunity for handling &s;ome di&s;puted Points in Law, which have no Relation to the Merits of the Cau&s;e: Every Error therefore, which is corrigible by Law, mu&s;t, in Suppo&s;ition of Law, be e&s;&s;ential to the Merits of the Cau&s;e; otherwi&s;e Writs of Error, in&s;tead of being con&s;titutional Remedies, would nece&s;&s;arily and e&s;&s;entially con|travene tho&s;e Words of the great Charter <HI>nulli negabimus, nulli differe|mus Ju&s;titiam vel Rectum.</HI> Thus then we conceive, that the Di&s;tinction &s;et up by his Honour between Appeals and Writs of Error, is ground|le&s;s; and that a Writ of Error is an Appeal upon the Merits in Law;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salk. <HI>511.</HI> Comb. <HI>276.</HI>&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord Ray, <HI>1447.</HI>&mdash;Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Hi&s;tory com.

<P>But as his Honour has been plea&s;ed in this Paragraph to furni&s;h a Comment on the Chapter of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> a Pa&s;&s;age from which we
<PB N="36" REF="041438_0040_101A89225D7E1068">
have mentioned, we mu&s;t take the Liberty to oppo&s;e it with another Comment on the &s;ame Words, given by the great Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> which clearly &s;hews, 1&s;t. That this Chapter cannot concern the King's Per&s;o|nal Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice on Appeals upon Matter of Fact, but the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice by his known and ordinary Courts; in all which, the King, tho' not in Fact, yet in Suppo&s;ition of Law is pre&s;ent, which is the Rea&s;on that the King him&s;elf, in the Words of the Charter, declares, he will not do what he intends his Court &s;hall not;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 46.</NOTE>
<Q>And thus &s;peaks the great Oracle of the Law; no Man &s;hall be condemned at the King's Suit, either before the King in his Bench, where the Pleas are <HI>Coram Rege,</HI> (and &s;o are the Words, <HI>nec &s;uper eum ibimus</HI> to be under&s;tood) nor before any other Commi&s;&s;ioner or Judge what&s;oever; and &s;o are the Words, <HI>nec &s;uper eum mittemus</HI> to be under&s;tood, but by the Judgment of his Peers, that is his Equals, and according to the Law of the Land;</Q>
and from this Paraphra&s;e the Author &s;ays, the Sen&s;e of the other Clau&s;e; <HI>we will deny, &s;ell, or refu&s;e Ju&s;tice to no Man,</HI> is di&s;tinctly under&s;tood: And upon the &s;ame Clau&s;e he further ob&s;erves thus;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> 55.</NOTE>
<Q>This is &s;poken in the Per&s;on of the King, who in Judgment of Law in all his Courts is pre&s;ent, and repeating the&s;e Words, <HI>Nulli vendemus,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
Or,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The&s;e Words as they have been expounded by other Acts of Parliament intend that,

<P>And thus it appears clearly from the be&s;t Comment on the Subject, that his Honour in applying this Chapter of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> to the &s;up|po&s;ed Appeal, in which the King was the Judge, has mi&s;under&s;tood the Text: We are therefore at a Lo&s;s to di&s;cover from whence his Honour has collected the Rea&s;on upon which he alledges this Chapter of the great Charter was grounded, (to wit) <HI>That large Sums of Money were de|manded for Writs of Appeal; and at other Times, they were denied or delayed, or that this Clau&s;e was made Part of the great Charter, to con|firm the Subject's Right to Appeals.</HI></P>

<Q>Book in Effect appeareth the whole Frame of the antient common Law of this Realm;</Q>
and then proceeds to In&s;tance the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation, by exhibiting from the <HI>Mirror</HI> a Sketch of the Au|thority of all the common Law Courts; among which are the Four great Courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and particularly the Court of King's Bench, of which he &s;peaks thus;
<Q>The King's Bench, Chief Ju&s;tices holding Pleas of the King, and &s;oon after the Office of Chief Ju&s;tice be|longed to redre&s;s, and puni&s;h by Writ, the wrongful Judgments, Wrongs and Errors of other Ju&s;tices, and to Cau&s;e to come before the King, the Parties and the Record, &amp;c. that is before the King, becau&s;e he always &s;at in Per&s;on in his Bench; tho' the Judges rendered the Judgments:</Q>
And from this Pa&s;&s;age it appears to a Demon&s;tra|tion, that the King's Bench before the Conque&s;t, enjoyed the Power of correcting by Writ, that is by Writ of Error, the wrongful Judg|ments and Errors of all other Courts; which in truth appear to be the only Appeal, (except in criminal Matters, where the Word is u&s;ed in a different Sen&s;e) that was ever known in the Law.</P>
<P>In the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the inferior Courts gra|dually dimini&s;hed, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Moment came to the great Courts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hales Hi&s;t. Com.

<P>But it may not be ami&s;s to take Notice here, of what the Lieutenant Governor &s;ays on the Subject of the Court of Hu&s;tings, or the Mayor's Court of <HI>London.</HI>&mdash;
<Q>In the Mayor and Sheriff's Court, commonly
<PB N="40" REF="041438_0044_101A892DC1640C70">
called the Hu&s;tings, where all the Property of the Citizens is deter|mined, a Writ of Error does not lie, but an Appeal: In Con&s;e|quence of which, the King appoints Commi&s;&s;ioners, who are <HI>to do full and &s;peedy Ju&s;tice.</HI> They do not only rever&s;e, or affirm the Judgment of the Hu&s;tings, but they give &s;uch Judgment as the Hu&s;tings ought to have given. The Juri&s;diction of the Hu&s;tings is by common Law; and Writs of Error do not lie in any Court who&s;e Juri&s;diction is by common Law, but an Appeal does.</Q></P>
<P>Upon which we ob&s;erve, that the Lieutenant Governor is again mi&s;|taken in &s;uppo&s;ing that an Appeal lies from the Hu&s;tings to Commi&s;|&s;ioners in Matters of Fact, and that tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners do full and &s;peedy Ju&s;tice upon the whole Merits, both in Fact and Law. On the Contrary, it will appear from the Peru&s;al of the Books on the Subject, that they act merely as a Court of Errors, in either rever&s;ing, or affir|ming the Judgment of the Hu&s;tings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New. Nat. Brev. <HI>53.</HI> H.</NOTE> <HI>Fitzherbert</HI> a&s;&s;erts,

And in the &s;ame Chapter, the Author &s;peaks repeatedly of &s;uing Writs of Error, and Commi&s;&s;ions to remove the Judgments of the Mayor and Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> and of correcting the Errors of their Judgments. And from the &s;everal Forms of Writs and Commi&s;&s;ions of Error to the Hu&s;tings, contained in that Chapter, it appears clearly that they are e&s;&s;entially and &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame as Writs of Error in other Ca&s;es, and to other Courts. And we &s;uppo&s;e that the Lieutenant Governor's Mi&s;take on this Subject, proceeded from the U&s;e of the Word Commi&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of Writ, tho' in Fact and Truth, every Writ of Error is more properly a Com|mi&s;&s;ion than a Writ.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law of Errors <HI>2</HI> and <HI>3.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="041438_0045_101A893083E1E198">
<HI>His Honour in the Sixth Paragraph ob&s;erves, that,</HI></P>
<Q>From the Nature of the Courts, which exi&s;ted by common Law, it is evident, that the Di&s;tinction now in U&s;e, between Writs of Error and Appeals, could not then exi&s;t; becau&s;e there was no &s;uch Di&s;tinction then, between the Jury and the Judges, as now in the Courts of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> By common Law the Jury was ab&s;olutely Judge of both Law and Fact. This is &s;till evident in the Sheriff's Court, Coroner's Court, and in the Hou&s;e of Peers: Appeals mu&s;t extend to the whole Merits, where there was no Di&s;tinction between the Verdict of the Jury, and the Judgment of the Court, as it is evident by common Law there is not.</Q>
<P><HI>Upon which his Maje&s;ty's Council Remark, that,</HI></P>
<P>Proofs are not wanting in the Books to &s;hew that Juries were in U&s;e, even among the antient <HI>Britons</HI>; that as Juries now do, &s;o did they of all Times try the Matters of Fact; that as they r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w are in &s;ome Sen&s;e Judges of Law, where they take upon them&s;elves to find general Verdicts, &s;o were they antiently; and by the antient common Law they were no more Judges of Fact &s;olely, than they now are: The Evidence formerly was never reduced to Writing any more than it now is, <HI>to wit,</HI> on Demurrers and &s;pecial Verdicts; in which the Law was always re&s;erved for the Determination of the Court; and the Maxim, <HI>ad Quae&s;tionem Juris re&s;pondent Judices, ad Quae&s;tionem Facti re&s;pondent Juratores,</HI> is an antient common Law Maxim: To &s;uppo&s;e therefore that there is now a Di&s;tinction between Appeals and Writs of Error, which did not antiently exi&s;t, appears to us altogether groundle&s;s; the Truth is, no &s;uch Di&s;tinction now does, or ever did exi&s;t. Nor do we conceive, that the In&s;tances adduced from this Sheriff's Court, Coroner's Court, and Hou&s;e of Peers, are at all pertinent: In the two fir&s;t, Facts are &s;ettled in the &s;ame Manner as they are in the Courts of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter, to wit,</HI> by a Jury; and in the Hou&s;e of Peers, nothing but Matters of Law, except where the Appeal is from the Equity Side of the Chancery, or Exchequer, in which the Proceedings by the Law of the Land are to be in the <HI>Pretorian</HI> Method, and the Evidence reduced to Writing, are ever determined there; it being below their Dignity to try Matters of Fact.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Salk.</HI> 511.</NOTE></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Council conceive, that his Honour is mi&s;taken in his Opinion, that Writs of Error were introduced into the Courts of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter, long after the great Charter.</HI> The Paragraph in which this is contained runs thus:</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="041438_0046_101A89337B5865E8"><Q>Writs of Error I have Rea&s;on to believe were introduced into the Courts of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> long after the Time of the Great Charter&mdash; Courts are known to a&s;&s;ume Powers, which did not originally belong to them. &mdash;Judge <HI>Coke</HI> &s;ays, <HI>boni Judicis e&s;t amp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iure Juri&s;dictionem.</HI> If the&s;e a&s;&s;umed Powers are found beneficial, they become confirmed by U&s;age; &s;uch are Writs of Error: But as they are not by common Law, they are confined to the Courts, where &s;uch U&s;age prevails. For this Rea&s;on, and their being u&s;eful they were extended by Acts of Parliament to other Courts and Places, where &s;uch U&s;age did not prevail.&mdash;The Nece&s;&s;ity of an Act of Parliament, &s;ufficiently &s;hews, that they are not by common Law: This is made more evident by what I think is univer&s;ally agreed, with Re&s;pect to the I&s;lands of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> where Judicial Trials are by Jury; that in Ca&s;e any Party is aggrieved by any Sentence, or Judgment, there he is to have his Remedy by Appeal, to the King in his Privy Council; and that Judgments are not to be examined by Writs of Error. The Rea&s;on given is, <HI>that tho' the&s;e I&s;lands are Parcel of the Domi|nions of the Crown of England, they are not Parcel of the Realm of England.</HI> The like Ob&s;ervation is made with Re&s;pect to the <HI>I&s;le of Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon this Paragraph his Maje&s;ty's Council Remark, that, they have already &s;hewn, that Writs of Error were by the common Law; and as a further Proof, refer to the Regi&s;ter of Writs, which was undoubt|edly compiled before the Conque&s;t: This Book, by which mo&s;t of the Writs &s;till in U&s;e are framed, contains a great Variety of Writs of Error: The Power of trying Errors has not therefore been a&s;&s;umed, but belongs to the King's Courts, from Time Immemorial; nor can the Maxim <HI>boni Judicis e&s;t ampliare Juri&s;dictionem,</HI> mean any Thing more than that Judges are in the Di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice, to exerci&s;e every po&s;&s;ible Power, which the Law will warrant. And as the Correction of Errors is by the common Law, it extends to all Times and to every common Law Court; the Di&s;tinction therefore, that Writs of Error do not lie in the Colonies, which is grounded on the other ba&s;ele&s;s Di&s;tinction, that nothing but the antient common Law of <HI>England</HI> extends to the Colonies, mu&s;t al&s;o appear to be without Foundation; and the &s;uppo&s;ed Nece&s;&s;ity of an Act of Parliament, to give Writs of Error in cer|tain Ca&s;es, which is in evident Allu&s;ion to the 31&s;t of El. Chap. I, whereby the Exchequer is authorized to hear and correct the Errors of
<PB N="43" REF="041438_0047_101A89360CAB06D8">
the King's Bench, is entirely groundle&s;s; for nothing is clearer than that before that Statute, Writs of Error did lie from the King's Bench, to the Hou&s;e of Lords: The Statute therefore was not to give a Writ of Error where it did not lie before; but to carry a Ca&s;e of Errors thro' the Exchequer to the Hou&s;e of Lords, in&s;tead of removing it immedi|ately to that augu&s;t and final Tribunal, as was the Practice by the com|mon Law.</P>
<P>Nor does the Argument in Support of the Po&s;ition, that Writs of Error did not lie at the common Law, receive any Weight from the In&s;tance a&s;&s;igned, concerning Appeals from <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI>; for my Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> from who&s;e Hi&s;tory of the common Law, his Honour has probably collected this In&s;tance, unfolds the Rea&s;ons upon which an Appeal lies from the&s;e I&s;lands, to the King in privy Council, which are the&s;e; tho&s;e I&s;lands were Part of the Dutchy of <HI>Normandy</HI>; by the Laws of which Dutchy, an Appeal did lie to the Duke in his Council; and as after the Annexation of that Dutchy to the Crown, the Laws of <HI>Normandy</HI> continued unaltered, and the King of <HI>England,</HI> was Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> the Appeal mu&s;t of Cour&s;e be to him in Privy Council.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this In&s;tance does not &s;hew that a Writ of Error, did not lie to tho&s;e I&s;lands, but the Contrary is rather to be &s;uppo&s;ed; becau&s;e they had Trials by Juries, and therefore it is to be pre&s;umed, that an Appeal from their Courts, lies in the &s;ame Ca&s;es as in the Courts of <HI>England, to wit,</HI> on Errors in Law only; in &s;hort, my Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> clearly intends to &s;hew the Rea&s;on, why an Appeal lies from tho&s;e I&s;lands to the King in Council, and not the Nature of that Appeal, which mu&s;t be pre&s;umed, if the &s;ame Word, in the &s;ame Author, is to be under&s;tood in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, to mean in Ca&s;e of Error only: Be&s;ides, as a Proof of this Matter it is certain, that a Writ of Error did lie to the King's Courts at <HI>Calais,</HI> which was not Parcel of the Domi|nions of <HI>England,</HI> but a di&s;tinct Dominion, dependent on the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>: Vin. Tit. Error, P. 484, No, 22, 4, In&s;t. 282: As to the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> it was antiently an independent Kingdom, governed by its own Laws, which have never been changed to this Day; and in that I&s;land, a Writ of Error is not known in their Law.</P>
<P>But as a Proof, that whatever the Laws of a dependent State may be, they are not to be changed by Authority of the Crown; it appears in
<PB N="44" REF="041438_0048_101A89387286A1A0">
the Books, that the Crown can only appoint Judges by Commi&s;&s;ion, to redre&s;s Inju&s;tice and Wrong, according to the Law and Ju&s;tice of the I&s;le. 4. In&s;t. 285.</P>
<P>The Three next Paragraphs, as they concern the Charters of &s;ome of the neighbouring Colonies, we &s;hall take the Liberty to con&s;ider as one; they are the&s;e;</P>
<Q><P><HI>In the Charter unto</HI> William Penn, <HI>of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania, <HI>the following Clau&s;e is in&s;erted,</HI> &s;aving and re&s;erving to us, our Heirs, and Succe&s;|&s;ors, the Receiving, Hearing and Determining of the Appeal or Ap|peals, of all or any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, <HI>of,</HI> in, or belonging to the Ter|ritories afore&s;aid, or touching any Judgment to be there made or given.</P>

<P>In <HI>Connecticut,</HI> as I am informed, Appeals to the King are not re&s;erved by their Charter; neverthele&s;s the Subject there on his Peti|tion to the King, obtains the Benefit of an Appeal by the King's Mandatory Writ; Obedience to which has never been refu&s;ed.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Upon the&s;e In&s;tances his Maje&s;ty's Council remark,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the Law of the Land, and not the Practice of other Colo|nies is to be their Guide; nor can &s;uch Practice conclude the Subject's Right in this Colony. It is a known Maxim, <HI>Actus me invito factus, non e&s;t Actus meus.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. That tho' the Charters of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> re&s;erve to the King the Right of hearing Appeals, it mu&s;t be in &s;uch Manner as the common Law will authorize, that is in Ca&s;es of Error only; and therefore nothing can be argued from the Practice of tho&s;e Colonies. If they as well as <HI>Connecticut,</HI> have gone into Mi&s;takes in Law, their Conduct can be no Rule for us, <HI>Fortior enim e&s;t Di&s;po&s;itio Legis quam Hominis</HI>; and we have his Honour's Declaration at another Time on this Occa&s;ion, that Errors when di&s;covered, ought not to be the Ground of future Proceedings, but mu&s;t be corrected. With Re&s;pect to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut,</HI> it is well known that they

And we cannot but be of Opinion, that his Maje&s;ty's Lieutenant Governor and Council, of this Colony, in the Execution of their important Tru&s;t, ought in Obedience to his Maje&s;ty's In&s;tructions, and the Statute of the 7. &amp; 8. of W. 3. to be guided by the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and not by the uncertain, and perhaps groundle&s;s Proceedings in other Colonies.</P>
<P>We cannot therefore agree with the Lieutenant Governor, when he &s;ays, in the next Paragraph.</P>
<Q>It is evident from what has been &s;aid, that no Writ of Error, can by the common Law lie in the Colonies, becau&s;e they are not Parcel of the Realm of <HI>England.</HI> No Act of Parliament has extended Writs of Error to the Colonies. The King has not given Authority to the Governor and Council of this Province, to hear and determine on Writs of Error &mdash; but has given them Authority to hear and determine on Appeals; their Authority is therefore clearly confined to Appeals, by which the whole Cau&s;e is brought before them, in order that if need be, it may be tran&s;mitted by farther Appeal, to the King in his Privy Council. &mdash; By what Authority, is the Governor and Council of <HI>New-York,</HI> appointed Judges in Error? I can &s;ee none &mdash; If neither Error nor Appeal lies, the Supreme Court becomes uncontroulable.</Q>
<P>In Oppo&s;ition to which, his Maje&s;ty's Council are of Opinion, that Writs of Error did lie by the common Law, and that no other Writs, than Writs of Error, would lie by the common Law, from the inferior Dominion; becau&s;e the Latter is not Parcel of, but depends on the For|mer; and that they lie <HI>ex Nece&s;&s;itate,</HI> becau&s;e the Law may not be changed, nor the Prince govern the inferior Dominion, which he holds <HI>Jure Coronae,</HI> otherwi&s;e than by the Laws of the &s;uperior Dominion: That the Power of this Court, does not alone depend on his pre&s;ent mo&s;t graciour

Maje&s;ty's Royal In&s;tructions, but was conferred in its original Con&s;titu|tion, by the In&s;tructions of his royal Progenitors, and Predece&s;&s;ors, by which we are expre&s;sly and only authorized to take Cognizance, of Ca&s;es of Error. That the Court being thus con&s;tituted, no Writ was nece&s;&s;ary to be expre&s;sly directed, by royal In&s;tructions, for <HI>Quando aliquid mandatur, mandatur et omne, per quod pervenitur ad illud.</HI></P>
<P>That his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's In&s;truction, has a nece&s;&s;ary Relation to former In&s;tructions, becau&s;e it concerns a Court, which had a Being before the i&s;&s;uing of the pre&s;ent In&s;truction; and becau&s;e it has a nece&s;|&s;ary Reference to the antient Practice of this Court, <HI>in directing the u&s;ual Writ to be i&s;&s;ued</HI>; that this Court has no Authority to hear, and determine on Appeals not known in the Law; and by Writ of Error, the Judges of the Supreme Court will be effectually controuled; becau&s;e by the Law of the Land, they can only err in Matters of Law, upon which either a Demurrer, &s;pecial Verdict, or Bill of Exception, will in all Ca&s;es furni&s;h this Court in the Exerci&s;e of its proper Juri&s;diction, with every Opportunity of correcting their Mi&s;takes in Law.</P>
<P>But as his Honour has thought proper, to con&s;ider more particularly what was offered by tho&s;e Judges in Con&s;truction of his Maje&s;ty's 32d In&s;truction, it will be proper to &s;et forth the Paragraphs on that Head, and give them a particular An&s;wer, they run in the&s;e Words:</P>
<Q><P>What has been &s;aid I think &s;ufficient&mdash;But to remove all Diffi|culties I can on this Head, I &s;hall next con&s;ider the Con&s;truction, which the Judges of the Supreme Court have put on the King's In|&s;truction; for their Purpo&s;e they have gone back to preceding In&s;tructions; tho' I think that no Argument from thence can be con|clu&s;ive. It is &s;aid that the Words, <HI>in Ca&s;e of Errors,</HI> being added in the former In&s;tructions, after the Word <HI>Appeal,</HI> the Sen&s;e of this la&s;t Word mu&s;t be re&s;trained to &s;hew, that the De&s;ign of the In|&s;truction is to confine the Governor and Council to the Rules ob&s;erved on Writs of Error. But in Law, the Word Appeal has a certain and determined Signification: The Word Error is often taken gene|rally to &s;ignify any Mi&s;take, and it cannot be confined to the Sen&s;e in which Error, is u&s;ed in a Writ of Error, &s;ince no Writ of Error lies in the Colonies.</P>
<P>The next Argument, is from the following Words, in the In&s;truc|tion, <HI>to i&s;&s;ue a Writ in the Manner, which has been u&s;ually accu&s;tomed:</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="041438_0051_101A89405CE7F2B8">
The Meaning mu&s;t certainly be in the Manner u&s;ually accu&s;tomed in Appeals, not in the Manner u&s;ually accu&s;tomed in this Place, as is pretended; for when the fir&s;t In&s;truction was given, there could be no accu&s;tomed Manner in this Place, and it cannot at any Time be intended, if the accu&s;tomed Manner was erroneous as it certainly is, if it be by Writ of Error. Be&s;ides, the U&s;age in this Place is &s;o weak, and of &s;o &s;hort Continuance, that it can be of no Force.</P>
<P>But that the Word Appeal, in the In&s;truction, is taken in its pro+per Sen&s;e, is evident from the other Words in the In&s;truction, which cannot he applied to a Writ of Error, viz. <HI>Appellant</HI> and <HI>Appellee,</HI> Terms never u&s;ed on a Writ of Error, and the Word <HI>Condemnation,</HI> which indicates a new Judgment on the Merits.</P></Q>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Council have already remarked, that this Court was not erected by his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, but was many Years ago, erected and confirmed as a Court of Errors in expre&s;s Terms, by his Maje&s;ty's royal Predece&s;&s;ors and Progenitors: In this View it was a proper com|mon Law Court, at the Time when his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty i&s;&s;ued his royal In&s;truction.</P>
<P>And therefore, tho' we agree that the Word Appeal, has in Law a certain and determined Sen&s;e, yet as that Word in its legal Sen&s;e&punc; is ne|ce&s;&s;arily confined to Matters of Law, and as his Maje&s;ty's Council dare not give into &s;o bold an Opinion, that his Maje&s;ty by his In&s;truction, <HI>intended to change the Law, and introduce Appeals upon Matters of Fact, unknown to the Laws of England</HI>; they think it their Duty to under|&s;tand the Word <HI>Appeal</HI> in the pre&s;ent, as the Word <HI>Appeal,</HI> in Ca&s;es of Errors ought to be under&s;tood in the former In&s;truction: And tho' his Honour does not under&s;tand the Word Errors, in the former In&s;truc|tions, as having any Relation to Writs of Error, but in the vulgar Sen&s;e as &s;ignifying any Mi&s;take, whether in Law or Fact; yet we cannot but be of Opinion, that the Word ought to be taken in its legal Sen&s;e; becau&s;e any other Appeal is not known in the common Law, than an Appeal for Errors in Law, and we think it our Duty to make the Law, and not vulgar Practice, the Rule for con&s;truing as well the former, as the pre|&s;ent royal In&s;truction; and that the more particularly, becau&s;e the very Purport and De&s;ign of both, appear to be the Correction of the Judg|ments of the Courts of Law, for which Rea&s;on the Judges of tho&s;e
<PB N="48" REF="041438_0052_101A8941EFF54090">
Courts are expre&s;sly prohibited from voting in the Court of Appeals, tho' they may attend to a&s;&s;ign the Rea&s;ons of their Judgments; and this not only proves (as the Judges have ju&s;tly ob&s;erved) that the Appeal in|tended in his Maje&s;ty's 32d In&s;truction, mu&s;t be on Matters in which they are incompetent, by having rendered their Judgment already, <HI>to wit,</HI> on Matters of Law, but al&s;o that the Appeals directed being from Courts of Law, and from the Judgments of tho&s;e Courts, in the rendering of which Judgments there cannot in the Nature of Things be any thing cor|rigible, but Errors in Law; the Words <HI>Appeal</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> of <HI>Errors,</HI> in the old In&s;truction, and the Word <HI>Appeal</HI> in the pre&s;ent In&s;truction, mu&s;t be under&s;tood in the &s;ame Sen&s;e. Nor can we think it ju&s;t to at|tempt to prove that the Word <HI>Errors</HI> in the old In&s;truction is not to be taken in its legal Sen&s;e, by a&s;&s;erting, that Writs of Error do not he in the Colonies, becau&s;e, whether they will lie or not, is to be determined by that In&s;truction. For if thereby a Court of Errors is e&s;tabli&s;hed, as it clearly is, the Writ of Error is of Cour&s;e given by nece&s;&s;ary Implication, agreeable the Maxim already mentioned; <HI>Quando aliquid mandatur, mandatur, &amp; omne per quod pervenitur ad illud,</HI> and another Maxim to the &s;ame Effect, <HI>quicunque aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur, et id &s;ine quo Res ip&s;a e&s;&s;e non pote&s;t,</HI> and it is evident, that Writs of Error are e&s;&s;ential to Courts of Error, becau&s;e they can exerci&s;e no Juri&s;diction in Erro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, but by a Writ of Error, to bring the Cau&s;e before them.</P>
<P>What his Honour has been plea&s;ed to remark, on the Clau&s;e in his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's In&s;truction, whereby the Governor or Commander in Chief is directed to i&s;&s;ue, <HI>a Writ in the Manner which has been u&s;ually accu&s;tomed,</HI> might be fully an&s;wered, by &s;imply ob&s;erving, that tho' we &s;hould agree with the Lieutenant Governor, that tho&s;e Words mu&s;t in|tend in the Manner u&s;ually accu&s;tomed in Appeals: Yet as the common Law knows of no other Appeals than for Errors in Matters of Law, the Writ u&s;ually accu&s;tomed by the Law of <HI>England,</HI> mu&s;t be the Writ intended, which in Appeals from Courts of Record is a Writ of Error.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that his Honour's rea&s;oning on this Head, is grounded on a palpable Mi&s;take in Fact; for the old In&s;truction does not contain &s;uch a Clau&s;e as he &s;uppo&s;es.</P>
<P>The Chain of rea&s;oning therefore on this Point is ju&s;tly this; by the old In&s;truction a Court of Errors is expre&s;sly erected, and con&s;equently the &s;ame In&s;truction gives a Writ of Error by nece&s;&s;ary Implication; the
<PB N="49" REF="041438_0053_101A8945170E1980">
Court of Appeals &s;poken of in the pre&s;ent In&s;truction, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the Court of Errors mentioned in the old In&s;truction, becau&s;e it di|rects the accu&s;tomed Writ, and therefore the accu&s;tomed Writ mention|ed in the pre&s;ent In&s;truction, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily intend the Writ of Error implicitly given by the other, and u&s;ed in Con&s;equence thereof, in a Cour&s;e of Practice for many Years: So that there can be no Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the Writ which has been u&s;ually i&s;&s;ued was erroneous, or that the i&s;&s;uing of that Writ at pre&s;ent, mu&s;t defend &s;olely on what he &s;uppo&s;es to be the &s;hort, tho' continued U&s;age in this Colony.</P>
<P>And that Appeals for Error will lie in the Colonies, and that the Prac|tice of bringing them has been long &s;ince u&s;ed in the Colonies, and ap|proved of by the King in privy Council, will appear from the Ca&s;e of one <HI>Jeoffry Jones,</HI> which was an Ejectment for Lands, brought in the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> III. in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and in which Cau&s;e a Ver|dict was found and Judgment given, and the Judgment was on an Ap|peal to his Maje&s;ty in privy Council, afterwards rever&s;ed for Error.</P>
<P>Hence therefore the Argument drawn from the Words <HI>Appellant</HI> and <HI>Appellee</HI> in the royal In&s;truction, mu&s;t be of little Weight; for be&s;ides that the old In&s;truction, which expre&s;sly, and only relates to Ca&s;es of Error, contains the &s;ame Words, it is evident, that if, in Law, the carrying up of a Cau&s;e by Writ of Error, is an Appeal, the Party Plaintiff mu&s;t be the <HI>Appellant,</HI> and the Defendant the <HI>Appellee</HI>: Nor will the Word <HI>Con|demnation,</HI> in the In&s;truction, furni&s;h the lea&s;t. Argument in Favour of the Lieutenant Governor's Con&s;truction; becau&s;e, by that Word, is in|di&s;putably intended the Judgment in the Court below, as will appear from the whole Clau&s;e, which directs, that the Appeal &s;hall be allowed, if the Party Appellant gives Security; (1&s;t) to pro&s;ecute his Appeal to Effect: 2dly, to an&s;wer the Condemnation, and pay the Damages and Co&s;ts, it the fir&s;t Sentence be affirmed. His Honour next proceeds to con&s;ider &s;ome, and not the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive Arguments urged by the Judges, <HI>ab inconvenienti,</HI> upon which he Remarks thus;</P>
<Q><P>The next Arguments again&s;t Appeals are from Inconveniency; tho' they be not material, yet as they may have more Weight than they ought to have, they de&s;erve a di&s;tinct An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is from the great Expence Appeals mu&s;t occa&s;ion; to this may be an&s;wered, that in the Colonies, where Appeals are in U&s;e, and
<PB N="50" REF="041438_0054_101A8946FB2E5C30">
where preparatory to an Appeal, the Evidence of Witne&s;&s;es is at the De|&s;ire of either Party taken down in Writing, in the common Law Courts, the Expence is not near &s;o great, as in common Suits in this Province; this Expence then mu&s;t be owing to &s;ome other Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It is again objected, that if Appeals be allowed, the Governor and Council, and afterwards the Privy Council in <HI>England,</HI> mu&s;t &s;it every Day in the Year, to hear and determine them.&mdash;The Supreme Court in this Province &s;its at mo&s;t only &s;ix Weeks, in the whole Year; &s;uppo&s;e an Appeal in every Cau&s;e, (an ab&s;urd Suppo&s;ition) the Trial on Appeal cannot take up &s;o much Time as in the Supreme Court, for the Formalities to bring the Cau&s;e to I&s;&s;ue, are unnece&s;|&s;ary in judging on the Merits.</P></Q>
<P>With Re&s;pect to his Honour's Remarks upon the Argument drawn from the Expence that would attend Appeals, in the <HI>Pretorian</HI> Way, it may be an&s;wered; that tho' the Pro&s;ecution of common Suits, in the neighbouring Colonies, is le&s;s expen&s;ive than in this Colony, yet we are far from believing, that the Charge of pro&s;ecuting an Appeal in tho&s;e Colonies would be le&s;s expen&s;ive, than the Trial of an ordinary Cau&s;e in this. And though the Law is generally cheaper in ordinary Ca&s;es, in tho&s;e Colonies, than in this, yet we conceive that the little Expence which there attends a common Suit, is one of the greate&s;t Evils under which they labour; as by that Means great Encouragement is given to a litigious Spirit, and has been &s;o far improved to the Di&s;advantage of the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> that Three Thou&s;and Six Hundred Writs have been returned at the Se&s;&s;ions of one of their County Courts; which we believe may be truly &s;aid, to exceed the Number of Writs that are i&s;&s;ued <HI>communibus Annis</HI> by all the Courts of this Colony, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t. But at the &s;ame Time we are of Opinion, that tho' the great Cheapne&s;s of Law is a real Di&s;advantage to any Country; yet we think that the Encouragement of Appeals in the <HI>Pretorian</HI> Way, would be an Expence too exce&s;&s;ive to be born by the Subject; and there|fore would furni&s;h ju&s;t Ground for the Argument <HI>ab inconvenienti.</HI></P>
<P>The Argument urged by the Judges, from the Inconvenience that would attend a continual Se&s;&s;ion of the Governor and Council, and of the King in privy Council, for hearing and determining Appeals, we think has been greatly mi&s;under&s;tood; for with Re&s;pect to the Governor and
<PB N="51" REF="041438_0055_101A894978FCF570">
Council, if they are to be a Court of Appeals in the Sen&s;e cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for by his Honour, they mu&s;t take Cognizance not only of Appeals from the Supreme Court, but from all the Circuit Courts, County Courts, City Courts, and Borough Courts, throughout the Colony, which would completely furni&s;h them with Bu&s;ine&s;s for the whole Year; and, as to Appeals to his Maje&s;ty in privy Council, if they were permitted to lie on Matters of Fact, from all the numerous Colonies in his Maje&s;ty's Do|minions, it is not to be doubted that the privy Council would be obliged to &s;et every Day in the Year, to hear and determine them.</P>
<P>But his Honour has in his Rea&s;ons omitted the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e of the Arguments <HI>ab inconvenienti</HI> which have the greate&s;t Weight. We cannot however avoid concluding with the Judges, that the Appeal contended for, would render the Expence of Trials by Jury u&s;ele&s;s, and therefore intolerable, and by making the Cau&s;e on Appeal, <HI>Res integra,</HI> would open a Flood-Gate to Perjury, encourage a Spirit of Litigiou&s;|ne&s;s, and introduce Idlene&s;s, to the Ruin of many Families, and the great Impoveri&s;hment of the Country, and would be attended with the utmo&s;t Danger to the Subject, in the Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of original Deeds; the In&s;pection of which is often Times ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary (as where a Ra|zure is the Gift of the Controver&s;y) in Order to do Ju&s;tice to the Cau&s;e: Be&s;ides this, the Benefit of a View not only appointed by the common Law, but by Statute, in Land Trials, would be lo&s;t to the Subject, on every &s;uch Appeal. And therefore, as long as there is any truth in the Maxim, <HI>quod e&s;t inconveniens &amp; contra Rationem, non e&s;t permi&s;&s;um in Lege,</HI> an Appeal on Matters of Fact, being attended with the&s;e Inconve|niencies cannot lie.&mdash;</P>
<P>His Honour proceeds next, to con&s;ider what he allows to be the principal Objection again&s;t an Appeal on Matters of Fact, on which he &s;peaks thus.</P>
<P>"I come now to the principal Objection, and which has the greate&s;t Weight, that by Judgment on Appeals, the great Privilege of Trial by Jury is taken away, <HI>the great Privilege which Engli&s;hmen enjoy above all other Nations</HI>: On this Head &s;everal Things de&s;erve Con&s;ideration."</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t.
<Q>The Character of the Per&s;ons who Judge on Appeals; the Gentlemen of the Council in this Province, and the privy Council in <HI>England,</HI> where on hearing of Appeals, the Lord high Chancellor,
<PB N="52" REF="041438_0056_101A894BB4053320">
the Chief Ju&s;tices of both Benches, and the Lords of greate&s;t Skill and Knowledge in the Law, u&s;ually attend: With &s;uch Judges, the Verdict of the Jury-will always have its ju&s;t Weight: Few Men in any difficult Ca&s;e would not rather tru&s;t to &s;uch Judges than to the u&s;ual Juries in this Country. It is evident from the 33d In&s;truction, that the King really intended the Benefit of his People, not any Ad|vantage to him&s;elf, by ordering Appeals; for the 33d In&s;truction, gives an Appeal in Ca&s;es of exce&s;&s;ive Fines in a le&s;s Sum, than in Ca&s;es of Property: And the King mu&s;t have de&s;igned that the Me|rits of the Cau&s;e &s;hould come before him by the Appeal, otherwi&s;e he cannot Judge whether the Fine be exce&s;&s;ive or not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I believe that there is not a Man in this Province conver&s;ant in the Courts of common Law, who will not allow, that many iniquitous or fal&s;e Verdicts have been given in it, and thereby great Inju&s;tice done. By the Laws of <HI>England</HI> every Wrong has its Remedy; what is the Remedy in this Ca&s;e? They tell us the Judge will give a new Trial: But this Remedy depends upon the Will and Plea&s;ure of the Judge; if he will not, the Subject has no Remedy. The Law of <HI>En|gland</HI> abhors all arbitrary Power, and therefore the King has given his Subjects in the Colonies a Right to Appeal from every iniquitous Verdict, without depending on the good Will or Plea&s;ure of any Judge. If no Appeals are allowed from the Supreme Court of <HI>New-York,</HI> the Court mu&s;t become uncontroulable; however agreeable this may be to Judges fond of Power, it mu&s;t be terrible to the Peo|ple under their Juri&s;diction.</Q></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Council are &s;eriou&s;ly of Opinion, that the Privilege of Trials by Juries, which <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> enjoy above all other Nations, is <HI>in Truth a great and excellent Privilege</HI>: It is a Privilege which &s;tands re|commended by the Experience of many Ages, and by the tendere&s;t Re|gard of our Ance&s;tors, for who&s;e Judgment we have the highe&s;t Vene|ration: It is in &s;hort the Birth-right of every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subject, and ought to be maintained with the mo&s;t unrelenting Firmne&s;s: But what is &s;till more, it &s;tands fixed, irrevocably fixed, by the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of the Land, which the mo&s;t cogent Rea&s;ons can never enable a Governor and Council to alter. Little therefore will it avail in Favour of an Appeal, that the Characters of tho&s;e who would in &s;uch Ca&s;e be the Judges, are con&s;picuou&s;ly eminent and unexceptionable, or that ini|quitous Verdicts are &s;ometimes given by Juries, or that Men in a difficult
<PB N="53" REF="041438_0057_101A895043682588">
Ca&s;e would rather &s;ubmit their Property to the Judgment of the Former than the Latter; for be&s;ides, that none can be &s;o competent Judges of the Matters of Fact as tho&s;e of the Neighbourhood, who are acquainted with the Parties, and the Witne&s;&s;es, and often Times with the Matter in Controver&s;y it&s;elf; and be&s;ides al&s;o the great Security to the Subject, which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ubmitting the Trial of Facts to one Set of Men, and the Determination of the Law upon tho&s;e Facts to another, (which are Rea&s;ons that at fir&s;t View give a Preference to Trials by Juries) the Impo&s;&s;ibility of a Change, even in Favour of a Method, if any &s;uch could be devi&s;ed, that would de&s;erve a Preference, mu&s;t be a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to any Thing that can be offered on this Head. The Gover|nor and Council are <HI>Jus dicere &amp; non Jus dare,</HI> and their judicial Ca|pacity &s;eems to have been de&s;igned in the original Con&s;titution of this Colony, and in Imitation of the Hou&s;e of Lords, as the dernier Re&s;ort in the Colony, &s;ubject however to the Correction of a &s;uperior Judica|tory in <HI>England,</HI> as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the Pre&s;ervation of our De|pendence; nor can the Crown (we &s;ay it with the mo&s;t profound Sub|mi&s;&s;ion) change the Law of the Land, becau&s;e the King can do no Wrong. Any Thing &s;hort of Legi&s;lative Authority, would be inade|quate to &s;o important a Purpo&s;e, and tho' his Maje&s;ty may have thought proper to grant Appeals in Ca&s;es of Fines, and that perhaps in the Sen&s;e contended for by the Lieutenant Governor; yet, this is not in Derogation of the Rights of the Subject, but the Effect of his Maje&s;ty's Royal Cle|mency. By the Policy of Law, all Fines belong to the Crown, and as the King may remit them when he plea&s;es, either in Part or in the Whole, he may without affording them any Cau&s;e of Complaint, and in Ea&s;e of the Subjects, direct &s;uch a Method of enquiring into the Merits of the Cau&s;e, as he thinks proper, to enable him to judge on the <HI>Quantum</HI> of the Fine impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>With Re&s;pect to unju&s;t or iniquitous Verdicts, the common and Sta|tute Law of <HI>England,</HI> as well as the Practice of the King's Courts, have provided ample Security again&s;t them; for be&s;ides the Remedy by new Trials which his Honour &s;uppo&s;es to be inadequate to the Evil, becau&s;e it depends upon the Will and Plea&s;ure of the Judge; the heavy Sentence which the Law inflicts by Attaint upon Juries who give iniquitous Verdicts, mu&s;t be an effectual Redre&s;s; the Verdicts impeached by At|taint, being Matters of Fact, are corrected by another Jury of Twenty-four Men, and the Manner of the Correction proves the &s;trict Attach|ment of the Law to the Rule, <HI>ad Quae&s;tionem Facti, re&s;pondent Juratores,</HI>

the Rever&s;al of the Judgment given in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, which is always the Con&s;equence of an Attaint pro&s;ecuted with Effect, furni&s;hes the mo&s;t ample Security to the Subject, and &s;atisfies the Demands of the Laws of <HI>England, which abhor all arbitrary Power.</HI></P>
<P>The evil Con&s;equences of di&s;hone&s;t Verdicts being therefore &s;o effec|tually guarded again&s;t by Law, we cannot be of Opinion that his Maje&s;ty ever intended by a Deviation from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Law of the Land, to give his Subjects in the Colonies a Right to Appeal from iniquitous Ver|dicts, in a Method unknown in the Law, and never applied in Ea&s;e of the Subjects in the Mother Country, who are doubtle&s;s entitled to an equal Share of the Royal Favour with his Maje&s;ty's American Subjects; and that in every In&s;tance of Practice, wherein Errors in Fact are to be corrected, the Office is by Law impo&s;ed on a Jury of the Country, is manife&s;ted in every Ca&s;e of Error, <HI>Quod coram vobis re&s;idet</HI>; for when a Man a&s;&s;igns Errors in Fact, he ought to put him&s;elf upon the Country, for the Jurors &s;hall only be Triers of that, and not the Judges, Yelv. 58. Law of Er. 10.</P>
<P>And on <HI>audita Querela,</HI> which is al&s;o grounded on Matter of Fact, a Jury is ever to determine; as if a Relea&s;e of a Debt given after Judg|ment, is alledged by the Party in Bar of Execution, a Jury mu&s;t try the Fact, whether the Relea&s;e was executed or not.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the common Law knows of no other Appeals on Matters of Fact from common Law Courts, than by Attaint, Error, <HI>Quod coram vobis re&s;idet,</HI> and Writ of <HI>audita Querela,</HI> on all which, Juries determine; while on the other Hand, a Cau&s;e of Errors in Law is never brought before the Judges, but by <HI>Writ of Error, fal&s;e Judgment, or Certiorari,</HI> and from Courts of Record, &s;uch as our Supreme Court is, by Writ of Error only, 2. <HI>Bacon, Abr. Title Errors</HI> 189.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Council are far from maintaining that no Appeals &s;hould be allowed from the Supreme Court of <HI>New-York,</HI> nor can we believe that the Judges of that Court did ever affect &s;o dangerous an Exemp|tion; on the Contrary, we are of Opinion with tho&s;e Judges, that <HI>Ap|peals by Writs of Error,</HI> will undoubtedly lie from their Judgments, <HI>and will effectually prevent that Court from becoming uncontroulable.</HI></P>

his Honour's Rea&s;ons, which were they well grounded, would naturally bring this excellent Method of Trial into Di&s;credit. His Words are the&s;e;</P>
<Q><P>Many of the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> tho' they be not of &s;o great Ex|tent of Territory, are more con&s;iderable in Numbers of People, Dig|nity of Per&s;ons, and Value of Property, than this Province is; there|fore all the Inconveniencies may happen in this Province, which did in the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> while all the Property in tho&s;e Counties were determined by Judges of the &s;ame County. I &s;hall recite them in the Words of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale, viz.</HI></P>
<P>All the Bu&s;ine&s;s of any Moment was carried by Factions, and Par|ties: For the Freeholders being generally the Judges, and conver&s;ing one among another, and being as it were the Chief Judges, not only of the Fact, but of the Law; every Man that had a Suit there, &s;ped according as he could make Parties, and Men of great Power and In|tere&s;t in the County, did ea&s;ily overbear others in their own Cau&s;es, or in &s;uch wherein they were intere&s;ted, either by Relation of Kindred, Tenure, Service, Dependence, or Application; the Remedy again&s;t the&s;e Evils which then prevailed, was by Appeal to the King.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Upon this we ob&s;erve:</HI></P>
<P>That the Evils thus complained of by Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> happened in a very remote Period, when Ignorance and Barbarity over&s;pread the Nation in general; in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. which commenced above 600 Years ago, Learning was wholly ingro&s;&s;ed by the Lawyers and the Clergy; the Freeholders of the Counties who were the Suitors to the inferior Courts, were both Triers of the Facts, and &s;ole Judges of the Law; and in Courts where Ignorance pre&s;ided, and the Judges were of inferior Rank, and owed this Service by the Tenure of their E&s;tates under the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne Lord, it was not to be wondered at, <HI>That Bu&s;ine&s;s was carried by Parties and Factions, nor that every Man &s;ped in his Suit according as he could make Parties, or had Intere&s;t in the County</HI>; but that the Ignorance of the Judges, and not the ill Con&s;equence re&s;ulting from Trials by Juries, is the Evil complained of by Lord <HI>Hale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hale's Hi&s;t. of c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m. Law. <HI>140.</HI></NOTE> appears clearly from the Account he gives in the &s;ame Page, of the Method taken by the King to Redre&s;s the Evil; <HI>therefore</HI> &s;ays the Author,
<Q>The King took another and more effectual Cour&s;e, for in the 23d Year of his Reign, by Advice of his Parliament, held
<PB REF="041438_0060_101A89576B77CEC0">
at <HI>Northampton,</HI> he in&s;tituted Ju&s;tices <HI>itinerant,</HI> dividing the Kingdom into &s;ix Circuits, and to every Circuit, allotting three Judges, <HI>know|ing or experienced in the Laws of the Realm.</HI></Q>
Nor can it be thought probable, that &s;o eminent and able a Judge as Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> could be &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, as to di&s;parage a Method of Trial, which he has taken Pains to di&s;play in every po&s;&s;ible advantageous Point of Light; and for this Purpo&s;e, has devoted a whole Chapter in his excellent Book, called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Chap. <HI>12.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the common Law of England</HI>; a Chapter &s;ufficient to convince every rea&s;onable Man, of the peculiar Advantages attending the mo&s;t excellent Method that ever was devi&s;ed by human Prudence, for the Trial and Determination of all Facts.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the Whole, his Maje&s;ty's Council are clearly of Opinion, 1&s;t. That omitting the Defects contained in the In&s;truments under Seal, by which an Appeal is &s;ought in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, an Appeal from the Verdict of a Jury, taking the Word in any Sen&s;e, is not known in the Law of <HI>England,</HI> it having been the e&s;tabli&s;hed and continual Practice, from Time immemorial, to try and determine all Facts by Juries.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That the Statute of the 7 and 8 W. III. has erected the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> which were in Force at the Time of the Settlement of this Colony, as the Standard of Law in the Colony. 3dly. That his Maje&s;|ty's In&s;truction, in which the Governor or Commander in Chief is directed to take Care, that no Man's Life, Members, Freehold, or Goods be taken away, or harmed, otherwi&s;e than by e&s;tabli&s;hed and known Laws, not repugnant to, but as much as may be, agreeable to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> (which is &s;imilar to every In&s;truction hitherto known to us, that has been i&s;&s;ued on that Subject &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of that Statute) is &s;upported by the afore&s;aid Statute, and is calculated to enforce an Obedi|ence to it.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. That in Con&s;equence of the afore&s;aid Statute and In&s;tructions, not only the Laws of the Colony, but the Practice of it's Courts, have always been in the &s;tricte&s;t po&s;&s;ible Conformity to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and the Practice of the King's Courts there.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. That an Extention of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and the Practice of the King's Courts there, as transferred to this Colony by the &s;aid Statute, and enforced by the afore&s;aid In&s;truction, has been further en|forced by &s;olemn Adjudication before the King in privy Council.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="57" REF="041438_0061_101A895A9F4E86C0">6thly. That the Terms of his Maje&s;ty's 32d In&s;truction, have a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Reference to &s;uch Appeals as were known to the Law of <HI>England,</HI> and had been long u&s;ed in this Colony; and that no other Appeals than in Ca&s;es of Error in Law (which are the only Ca&s;es of Appeal provided for in former In&s;tructions) have, until the pre&s;ent In&s;tance, ever been brought here.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. That the Appeal intended by the &s;aid 32d In&s;truction, mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Words of the In&s;truction them&s;elves, nece&s;&s;arily be an Appeal from the Judgment of the Judges in Matters of Law, and that if the In&s;truction had intended an Appeal from the Verdict of a Jury, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ning of which, the Judges are never concerned, they, as being the mo&s;t competent Judges of a Verdict founded on Evidence given before them, would never have been excluded from &s;itting in the Court above.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. That tho' &s;trictly &s;peaking, there are &s;everal Species of Appeals, known in the Law, which are therefore generally called by their peculiar Names, yet the In&s;tances are numerous in the Books, to prove that the carrying up of a Cau&s;e by Writ of Error, is in Law called an Appeal.</P>
<P N="9">9thly. That wherever an Appeal is on Matters of Fact, as in <HI>Attaint, audita Querela</HI> and Error, <HI>Quod coram vobis re&s;idet,</HI> the Errors are correc|ted, not by the Judges, but by the Inque&s;t of a Jury.</P>
<P N="10">10thly. That therefore, a Departure from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Law of the Land, in giving &s;uch a Con&s;truction to the Terms of his Maje&s;ty's 32d In&s;truction, as would make this Court cognizant of the Cau&s;e, as it is now attempted to be brought before us, that is, <HI>on Errors in Fact,</HI> would do Violence to the true Sen&s;e of this, as well as the other In&s;truction of his Maje&s;ty, by which con&s;titutional Juri&s;dictions, and the &s;ame Mea&s;ures of di&s;tributing Ju&s;tice, as are e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>England,</HI> are clearly intended to be transferred to this Colony.</P>
<P N="11">11thly, and LASTLY.

<P>I beg you would indulge me with a few Words, in order to confirm what I have already &s;aid, when in Compliance with your Reque&s;t I gave you the Rea&s;ons of my Conduct. Your Honours are &s;en&s;ible that this Battery, rai&s;ed again&s;t the Laws by which we have been &s;o long governed, and a &s;ettled Practice which has obtained for &s;o great a Number of Years, and which is exactly conformable to the Practice in <HI>England,</HI> is founded on the &s;ingle Word <HI>Appeal</HI> in the 32d In&s;truction; and on the <HI>Suppo&s;i|tion,</HI> that nothing el&s;e could be under&s;tood by it but &s;uch Appeals as are agreeable to the Practice of civil Law Courts: For if it was po&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand it in any other Sen&s;e, no one would &s;uppo&s;e that the whole Sy&s;tem of our Law, which has been built up by the Wi&s;dom of &s;o many Ages, was intended to be overturned by this &s;ingle Word. In order to &s;hew how groundle&s;s this Suppo&s;ition was, I ob&s;erved to your Hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, that Writs of Error, and the &s;everal other Reliefs provided for by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ws of <HI>England,</HI> again&s;t a Judgment, were properly termed Appeals; tho' that Word was but &s;eldom u&s;ed, for the Rea&s;ons I then mentioned. And for Proof, I relied on the authority of Dr. <HI>Cowel</HI>: I own this Au|thority to be but &s;lender, becau&s;e he was more of a Civilian than a com|mon

Lawyer; but as I was but ju&s;t returned from the Country, and had but little Time amid&s;t the Multiplicity of Bu&s;ine&s;s which a long and un|expected Ab&s;ence crowded upon me, to prepare for this extraordinary Occa&s;ion, it was the be&s;t I could then produce, tho' I was &s;ure what I a&s;&s;erted was well founded. I could indeed have produced &s;everal other Dictionaries, but as they all made U&s;e of the very Words of <HI>Cowel,</HI> and referred to no Authorities, I laid no great Stre&s;s on them. I have now an Opportunity of confirming what I then &s;aid, by one of the be&s;t Au|thorities in the Law, my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale</HI>: And for that pur|po&s;e I beg Leave to read two Pa&s;&s;ages in his Hi&s;tory of the common Law, Page 150, and Page 48. [Here they were read.] The&s;e Autho|rities I &s;uppo&s;e will be a full Confirmation of what I have advanced; and will &s;how that this Appellant is very much mi&s;taken in his Explanation of this In&s;truction.</P>
<P>For let it be admitted, as I think it certainly mu&s;t after what I have &s;hewn, that there are Appeals at common Law as well as in the civil Law, is it not evident to a Demon&s;tration, that when it &s;ays you &s;hall ad|mit Appeals from the Courts of common Law, that it mu&s;t mean &s;uch Appeals as are known to the common Law? And if Writs of Error are called Appeals in the common Law, to prove which an unexceptionable Authority has ju&s;t been produced, and the In&s;truction &s;ays, that for the Purpo&s;e of Appeals, you are to i&s;&s;ue a Writ in the Manner which has been u&s;ually accu&s;tomed; does it not appear clear as the Sun, that Writs of Error, or &s;uch Writs as are known to the common Law, are hereby directed to be i&s;&s;ued? The contrary Explanation mu&s;t appear to your Honours very unnatural, <HI>to wit,</HI> tho' there are Appeals by the common Law, as well as in the civil Law, yet, when it &s;ays you are to admit Ap|peals from <HI>common Law Courts,</HI> it means you are to admit them in the <HI>civil Law Form.</HI> It means you are to direct the common Law Courts to change the whole Form of their Proceedings in order to comply with the In&s;truction, and to form a motley Court which &s;hall partake of the Inconveniencies of both the others, and enjoy the Advantages of neither. It means when it directs you to &s;end the u&s;ual Writ, that you &s;hall &s;end &s;uch a Writ, as both for Matter and Form never was &s;ent to any common Law Court before. It mu&s;t be evident then, that this can neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Meaning of the In&s;truction.</P>
<P>Since your Honours have indulged me thus far, I beg Leave to read a few Lines farther in the &s;ame Book. The &s;econd Rea&s;on this great
<PB N="60" REF="041438_0064_101A8963103C8E20">
Lawyer gives, why Cau&s;es &s;hould not come before the Parliament, in the fir&s;t In&s;tance is, becau&s;e by that Means the Subject would lo&s;e his Trial <HI>per Pares,</HI> and con&s;equently his Attaint, in Ca&s;e of a Mi&s;take in Point of I&s;&s;ue or Damages, to both which he is intitled by Law. Here we &s;ee Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale</HI> po&s;itively &s;ays, that the Subject is intitled to a Trial by his Equals, that is, by a Jury, and al&s;o to his Attaint in Ca&s;e of a Mi&s;take in Point of I&s;&s;ue or Damages. If this be a good Rea&s;on in the Ca&s;e here mentioned, it is al&s;o a good Rea&s;on again&s;t trying the Merits of Verdicts in the Court pretended to be erected by this In&s;truction; for tho' this does not deprive the Subject of a Trial by a Jury, yet it does much wor&s;e, it puts him to all the Inconveniencies of that Trial, renders it prodigiou&s;ly more expen&s;ive than ever; and then makes it entirely u&s;ele&s;s. And it takes away the Remedy by Attaint, which is al&s;o here &s;aid to be the Subject's Right; for to what Purpo&s;e would it be to bring an Attaint again&s;t a Jury for giving a Verdict, which whatever it may co&s;t, is not worth one Farthing to either Party, &s;ince the Matter mu&s;t be finally determined by another Set of Judges; who for all Matters of Moment will become the &s;tanding Jury in all Ca&s;es without being liable to any &s;uch Penalty. And thus we &s;hould be deprived of Privi|leges which his Honour agrees with every Body el&s;e we ought to enjoy, becau&s;e they are &s;uch as we are intitled to by the common Law, in the mo&s;t confined Sen&s;e of the Word.</P>
<P>'Tis true it may be &s;aid, that the Right to bring an Attaint is not to be con&s;idered, becau&s;e in a very long Series of Years, no &s;uch Action has been brought. But it cannot be denied, that the Privilege of a Sub|ject to the Laws of <HI>England</HI> is very great, in this, that he cannot be di|ve&s;ted of any Part of his Property but by the Judgment of his Peers, and they not only under the &s;acred Obligation of an Oath, but al&s;o under the Danger of an Attaint if they give a fal&s;e Verdict. And this is a Privilege no Man in his Wits will ever willingly part with, who knows its Value.</P>
<P>For whatever Contempt may be put on Juries, in the Law they are of the highe&s;t E&s;timation, and no one ought to pretend to be wi&s;er than the Law. The greate&s;t Men have ever valued it as the be&s;t Way of trying Facts. And the Lord Chancellor him&s;elf, when a Fact is in I&s;&s;ue before him, delivers it to the King's Bench to be tried by a Jury. But the Advantages of this Trial by Juries, are &s;o well de&s;cribed by Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale,</HI> in his 12th Chap. of the Hi&s;tory of the common Law, al|ready read in this Court, that I dare not pre&s;ume to do Injury to the Subject, by Encomiums unworthy of its Excellency.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="041438_0065_101A5EDBAAC42A78">This Chief Ju&s;tice, on whom no Man who has not made the Law his Study, ought to be a&s;hamed to pin his Faith, prized Trials by Juries &s;o highly, that in order to &s;hew the Excellency of the common above the civil and other Laws, he pitches upon this and De&s;cents, as two of its principal Perfections.</P>
<P>Therefore, your Honours will put too great a Value on this Privilege, to regard, in determining this mo&s;t important Point, what is done in other Colonies; becau&s;e, they have no Power to alter our Laws. If Cau&s;es are brought up by Way of Appeal from Verdicts in &s;ome of them; if two or three contradictory Verdicts are taken in the &s;ame Cau&s;e in others; your Honours will clearly &s;ee the Ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a Practice; and while you leave them to plead either Ignorance or Ne|ce&s;&s;ity for not conforming to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> expre&s;sly enjoined by his Maje&s;ty's In&s;tructions to his Governors, you will zealou&s;ly &s;up|port, according to his mo&s;t gracious Maje&s;ty's Intentions, and Favour to us, every Practice con&s;onant to tho&s;e who&s;e&s;ome Laws.</P>
<P>Neither is this Appeal in any Manner favoured by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and therefore nothing &s;urpri&s;ed me more than to find that quoted in Favour of an Appeal. The Clau&s;e <HI>nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, aut deferemus Ju&s;titiam,</HI> does no more prove that the King is to try every Cau&s;e him&s;elf, than every Writ or Pleading does, which &s;uppo&s;es him pre&s;ent in all his Courts of Ju&s;tice. This appears from my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Comment on tho&s;e Words. And to &s;hew how little <HI>Magna Charta</HI> favours &s;uch an Appeal as this, I will read the whole Clau&s;e from which the&s;e Words are taken, and a Part of my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Com|ment upon it. The Clau&s;e runs thus, <HI>Nullus liber Homo capiatur, vel impri&s;onetur, aut di&s;&s;ei&s;iatur de libero Tenemento &s;uo, vel Libertatibus, vel liberis Con&s;uetudinibus &s;uis; aut utlagetur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo Mode de&s;truatur; nec &s;uper eum ibimus, nec &s;uper eum mittemus, ni&s;i per legale Judicium Parium &s;uorum, vel per Legem Terrae; nulli vendemus, nulli ne|gabimus, aut deferemus, Ju&s;titiam, vel rectum.</HI> On which my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> &s;ays, "again&s;t this antient and fundamental Law, and in the Face thereof, I find an Act of Parliament made, that as well Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize as Ju&s;|tices of Peace, without any finding or Pre&s;entment by the Verdict of twelve Men, upon a bare Information for the King before them made, &s;hould have full Power and Authority by their Di&s;cretions, to hear and de|termine all Offences and Contempts committed or done by any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, agiain&s;t the Form, Ordinance and Effect of any Statute made and

not repealed, &amp;c. by Colour of which Act &s;haking this fundamental Law, it is not credible what horrible Oppre&s;&s;ions and Exactions to the Undoing of infinite Numbers of People were committed by Sir <HI>Richard Emp&s;on,</HI> Knight, and <HI>Edmund Dudley,</HI> being Ju&s;tices of Peace throughout <HI>England</HI>; and upon this unju&s;t and injurious Act, (as com|monly in like Ca&s;es it falleth out) a new Office was created, and they made Ma&s;ters of the King's Forfeitures. But at the Parliament holden in the Fir&s;t Year of H. VIII. this Act 11, H. VII. is recited, and made void and repealed and the Rea&s;on thereof is yielded, for that by Force of the &s;aid Act it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> manife&s;tly known, that many &s;ini&s;ter and crafty, feigned and forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Informations, had been pur&s;ued again&s;t divers of the King's Subjects, to their great Damage and wrongful Vexation: And the ill Succe&s;s hereof, and the fearful End of the&s;e two Oppre&s;&s;ors, &s;hould deter others from committing the like, and admoni&s;h Parlia|ments, that in&s;tead of this ordinary and precious Trial <HI>per Legem Terrae,</HI> they bring not in ab&s;olute and partial Trials by Di&s;cretion." In &s;hort, whoever will &s;upport a Practice of this Nature, ought by no Means to refer to Books of the Law; for the Laws of <HI>England</HI> abhor it, and bear Te&s;timony again&s;t it in every Page. Neither can it be &s;upported by advancing new Principles, &s;uch as the&s;e. 1&s;t. The common Law ex|tends to the Plantations, but the Statute Law does not. 2dly. The Laws of <HI>England</HI> extend to the Plantations, but the Execution being in the King, he can erect what Courts for the Di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice he plea&s;es. Principles new as the&s;e are, unheard, unthought of, before this important Trial between <HI>Thomas For&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> one would think needed &s;ome Proof, &s;ome Authority at lea&s;t to e&s;tabli&s;h them; for certainly they are not &s;elf-evident Propo&s;itions. But nothing of the Sort have I heard. On the Contrary, it is &s;uppo&s;ed by all Civili|ans, that Colonies carry out with them the Laws of their Mother Coun|try. And if they do, they mu&s;t take tho&s;e with them, which are in Force at the Time they emigrate, becau&s;e they are familiar and known. They can never upon their Emigration be obliged to have Recour&s;e to tho&s;e Rudiments of Law, which were fir&s;t formed by their Mother Country. They can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o well acquainted with Antiquity as to know what they are. Neither can any good Rea&s;on be given, why they &s;hould not reap the Advantages of all the Improve|ments made by &s;ucceeding Ages. Be&s;ides, no Man can draw the Line between tho&s;e Laws which &s;tand upon the Authority of Acts of Parlia|ment, and that of the common Law: For many Things are by com|mon Law which fir&s;t commenced by Acts of Parliament; many &s;eem
<PB N="63" REF="041438_0067_101A896C434BD770">
to &s;tand on the Authority of Acts of Parliament, which were before by common Law. So that this Principle, if adopted, would produce more Confu&s;ion than a &s;udden Repeal of all Laws: By the&s;e Means the Trials by Battle, and Fire Ordeal, would be again introduced. In &s;hort it is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign, when by his In&s;tructions he directed that the Laws &s;hould be admini&s;tered in a Me|thod as nearly as po&s;&s;ible according to the Laws in <HI>England,</HI> intended we &s;hould conform to all the Ad&s;urdities of an ignorant Age. No, his gracious Intentions doubtle&s;s were, that we &s;hould enjoy the Benefit of tho&s;e Laws, which by the Improvement of many Ages were wrought up to the highe&s;t Perfection, and by this he conferred on us the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing which his princely Wi&s;dom could be&s;tow, and took the be&s;t Method of &s;ecuring the Dependence of the Colonies. So prepo&s;terous is it to &s;uppo&s;e that it would be &s;ecured by depriving the People of this Colony of the Laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As for the other Principle, that the King can erect what Courts he plea&s;es for the Di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice, it is not only contrary to Law, but it is big with the mo&s;t dangerous Con&s;equences. The King it is true is the Fountain of Ju&s;tice, and the Execution of the Law is in him, by the Con&s;titution of <HI>England</HI>; but the Mode of di&s;pen&s;ing it is fixed by Law, and unalterable, but by Act of Parliament. He may erect as many new Courts as he plea&s;es, but they mu&s;t determine accord|ing to the Cour&s;e of the common Law, and proceed on Facts found by Juries. But that he can erect Courts which &s;hall have a Power to try Cau&s;es in what Manner they plea&s;e, mu&s;t appear extremely &s;hock|ing to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ear, and to any one who has the lea&s;t Idea of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution. This is expre&s;sly provided again&s;t by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> as appears by the Authority ju&s;t now read. On this Principle a Court &s;imilar to the Inqui&s;ition might be erected, and Torture intro|duced. By the&s;e Means the grand Difference between an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sub|ject, and a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>Turkey,</HI> would be annihila|ted; for that con&s;i&s;ts more in the Mode of admini&s;tering Ju&s;tice to them, than in the Laws them&s;elves. Happy for us we live under a Monarch patriotic and beneficent, who glories in being the Sovereign of Free-Men, not of Slaves; and will reject with Abhorrence every Preroga|tive which may be exerted to the Ruin of his Subjects. Of this we had an ample Proof, when one of the fir&s;t Acts of his Reign was to &s;ecure the Independence of the Judges, by parting with what was an un|doubted Prerogative of his Crown; and I dare venture to prophe&s;y
<PB N="64" REF="041438_0068_101A896EAAA20448">
that whoever &s;eeks to recommend him&s;elf to his mo&s;t gracious Maje&s;ty's Favour, by undertaking to prove that his Subjects are no better &s;ecured in their Liberties and E&s;tates than tho&s;e of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Monarchs, will appear to have taken the wor&s;t Way of making his Court. &mdash;</P>
<P>Before I conclude, as in the Pro&s;ecution of this Scheme, not only Juries but the Practi&s;ers of the Law, and the Judges have been treated with Di&s;re&s;pect; Ju&s;tice obliges me to &s;ay, that I have a pretty general Acquaintance with the Practi&s;ers, e&s;pecially with tho&s;e that are mo&s;t eminent, and that from what I have ob&s;erved of their Conduct, I can declare, that I know none who do not behave them&s;elves with a Can|dour, Integrity, and Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, which does Honour to their Profe&s;&s;ion. And of this they have on this Occa&s;ion exhibited a Proof. They &s;uppo&s;e the Appeal now brought illegal and injurious to the Country, and for that Rea&s;on, not one of them could be prevailed on to give his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to, but all rejected the Project with Di&s;dain. This will long be remembered to their Honour.</P>
<P>As for the Judges they or &s;ome of them are reproached, as forgetting their Duty in endeavouring to rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions: On which I &s;hall ob&s;erve in the Words of a great Lawyer; that a Judge is not to be defamed or vilified with Re&s;pect to his Parts, Fitne&s;s for his Place, &amp;c. for if this were allowed, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to keep in the People that Veneration for their Per&s;ons, and Submi&s;&s;ion to their Judgments, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to execute the Laws with Vigour and Suc|ce&s;s. What Grounds there are for accu&s;ing them of rai&s;ing the Pa&s;&s;ions I know not. When &s;uch Principles are advanced as tend to overturn a Con&s;titution, of which every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> is fond, his Re&s;entment will naturally be rai&s;ed; and when the Mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from &s;uch Principles are either &s;hewn or hinted at, his Anger will be &s;till more inflamed. But who ought to be accu&s;ed of rai&s;ing the Pa&s;&s;ions when this is the Ca&s;e, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of your Honours. Certainly our Duty obliges us to pre&s;ent to your Honours a full View of the Inconveniencies which mu&s;t attend this Alteration of the Law.</P>
<P>It does a peculiar Honour to Juries, Lawyers, and Judges, that tho&s;e who impeach their Conduct, declare again&s;t the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> that excellent Sy&s;tem which can hardly be con&s;idered without Admiration, or &s;poke of without Rapture, and which our mo&s;t Gracious King is &s;o far from endeavouring to deprive us of, that he has particularly directed his
<PB N="65" REF="041438_0069_101A8970682C7838">
Governors to conform to them as much as po&s;&s;ible, by an In&s;truction, which lately and accidentally came to our Knowledge, whereby his Go+vernor or Commander in Chief, is directed to take Care that no Man's Life, Member, Freehold, or Goods, be taken away or harmed in this Province otherwi&s;e than by the e&s;tabli&s;hed and known Laws, not repug|nant to, but as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, conformable to the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> This &s;hows the Propriety of the Ob&s;ervation, that the Judges ought not to be directed in their Duty by &s;uch Scraps of In&s;tructions as may from Time to Time be communicated to them: For had we been directed in our Conduct by the Thirty-&s;econd In&s;truction, and mi&s;under&s;tood it, to &s;ignify in Appeal again&s;t a Verdict, we &s;hould have introduced a Prac|tice, not only contrary to this In&s;truction by which the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are enforced, but to make U&s;e of the Words of the Oracle of the Law, contrary to and in the face of <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> This In&s;truction alone I &s;hould imagine would be a &s;ufficient Inducement to your Honours, to &s;up|port the Practice of the Law here, in every Thing which is con&s;onant to the Laws at Home.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t Thing I beg Leave to trouble your Honours with is, an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the 4th <HI>Henry</HI> IV. Chap. 23, which runs thus: Whereas as well in Plea real, as in Plea per&s;onal, after Judgment given in Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of our Lord the King, the Parties be made to come upon grievous Pain, &s;ometime before the King him&s;elf, &s;ometime before the King's Council, and &s;ometimes to the Parliament, to an&s;wer thereof, of new, to the great impoveri&s;hing of the Parties afore&s;aid, and in the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of <HI>the common Law of the Land.</HI> It is ordained and &s;tabli&s;hed, that after Judgment given in the Courts of our Lord the King, the Parties and their Heirs, &s;hall be thereof in Peace until Judgment be un|done by Attaint, or Error, if there be Errors, as hath been u&s;ed by the Laws in the Times of the King's Progenitors.</P>
<P>This Act I hope will be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the Objections of the mo&s;t &s;crupulous; for it appears not only to be made in order to prevent &s;uch Appeals as are now contended for, but al&s;o in Affirmance of the common Law. So that I confidently expect your Honours will unanimou&s;ly re|ject this Appeal, and approve of our Conduct.</P>
