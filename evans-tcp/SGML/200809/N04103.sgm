<P>SOLOMON ob&s;erveth, that <HI>as cold Waters are to a thir&s;ty Soul; &s;o is good News from a far Country.</HI> We have here good News indeed from the high|e&s;t Heaven, for the &s;inful Children of Men who have for&s;aken GOD the Fountain of living Wa|ters, for broken Ci&s;terns that can hold no Water; and are now in Danger of peri&s;hing in the Flames of Hell without a Drop of Water, without the lea&s;t Mitigation of their Torment. Behold! the Son of GOD hath ta|ken our Nature, and purchas'd the HOLY SPIRIT in his Graces and Comforts; and inviteth us to come, and take the&s;e Waters freely. This Chapter is the la&s;t in the Bi|ble, and clo&s;eth the whole Canon of &s;acred Scripture. Worthy Expo&s;itors apprehend that we have here a further De&s;cription of the glorious Joy and con&s;ummate Happi|ne&s;s of the heavenly <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> which is abundantly re|fre&s;hed with a pure River of Water of Life proceeding

out of the Throne of GOD, and of the LAMB! All our Springs are in GOD, the Fountain of Grace and Glory. <HI>In his Pre&s;ence is Fulne&s;s of Joy, and at his right Hand are Plea&s;ures forevermore.</HI> P&s;alm 16. 11. There is al&s;o the <HI>Tree of Life;</HI> GOD's People eat freely of the Fruits of it, and live forever. And there &s;hall be <HI>no more Cur&s;e.</HI> No Tempter &s;hall ever approach that high and holy Place, no Sin &s;hall ever defile it; and therefore it mu&s;t be forever free from all the Fruits of the Cur&s;e. There &s;hall be <HI>no Night</HI> there, and therefore no Need of a Candle. Nor is there any Need of the Light of the Sun to make and rule the Day. No! No! that GOD who <HI>is Light,</HI> and in whom is <HI>no Darkne&s;s</HI> at all, forever &s;hineth in his meridian Brightne&s;s. The Father of Lights with whom is no Shadow of turning makes one perma|nent and eternal Day in which not the lea&s;t Cloud inter|po&s;eth to hide the Light of his Countenance from his People. But is it po&s;&s;ible that any of us the Children of Apo&s;tate <HI>Adam,</HI> who was thru&s;t out of the earthly Para|di&s;e for his fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, in which we were all in|volved; I &s;ay is it po&s;&s;ible, that we &s;hould ever inhabit the heavenly Paradi&s;e? Yes! Yes! the Son of GOD came down from Heaven, and in our Nature was obedi|ent to Death, yea was laid in the Grave; that he might rai&s;e us up to &s;it with him in tho&s;e heavenly Places. And now the Spirit and the Bride &s;ay, <HI>Come.</HI> De&s;cend, O ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of GOD! and rai&s;e us above the dead|ning Influence of earthly Things; refre&s;h our Souls with the&s;e living Waters, and we will run the Race &s;et before us, till we enter in through the Gates into that City, of which &s;uch glorious Things are &s;poken in the Word of GOD. But to return, In the Words, we have a mo&s;t gracious Invitation given us to come, and take the Wa|ters of Life freely. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride &s;ay, Come,</HI> &mdash;The HOLY SPIRIT of GOD who indited the Scrip|tures, &s;peaks in them; <HI>The Holy Gho&s;t faith, To Day if ye will hear his Voice, Harden not your Hearts.</HI> Heb. 3, 7, 8.

Manife&s;tations of his Favour unto them. And when GOD's People have ta&s;ted that the LORD is gracious, they are de&s;irous that others &s;hould come, and &s;ee how good the LORD is. When JESUS had revealed him&s;elf to the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> and given her the Water of Life; &s;he went her Way into the City, and &s;aid to the Men, <HI>Come</HI>&mdash;John 4. 28, 9. <HI>And let him that is athir&s;t, Come.</HI>&mdash;All &s;uch as feel their Want of CHRIST and his &s;aving Benefits, and have earne&s;t De&s;ires after them, are here invited to come; which we do by Faith, when we go out of our&s;elves as to any carnal Dependance upon our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength, and go to GOD by JESUS CHRIST as to the Fountain of all &s;aving Good. We have then a general Invitation, <HI>And who &s;oever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</HI> GOD will not im|po&s;e and force the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel upon any, whe|ther they will or no; but then all &s;uch as thir&s;t after them, and are willing to receive them upon Go&s;pel Terms, may come and welcome: And none need be di&s;couraged becau&s;e they have no Money or valuable Price to lay down to purcha&s;e them. No, the&s;e are all purcha&s;ed by JESUS CHRIST at the Price of his mo&s;t precious Blood; and they are offered to us as a free Gift, which we mu&s;t heartily accept as it is offered. And if by the Grace of GOD we do this, they became our's. If CHRIST and his Benefits were &s;et to Sale, we poor peri&s;hing Sinners might well de&s;pair, and &s;ay our Hope is peri&s;hed; but now that our LORD offereth him&s;elf and all &s;aving Good freely, even the chief of Sinners &s;hould be encouraged to hearken to this mo&s;t gracious Invitation. By the <HI>Water of Life</HI> we may under&s;tand the &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings purcha&s;ed by CHRIST, and commu|nicated by his SPIRIT. John 4. 10. <HI>If thou knewe&s;t the Gift of GOD, and who it is that faith to thee, Give me to drink; thou would&s;t have a&s;ked of him, and he would have given thee living Water. 7. 38, 39.

<P>The ble&s;&s;ed GOD is in Scripture repre&s;ented to us un|der this Similitude, the <HI>Fountain of living Waters;</HI> and he is in CHRIST JESUS a <HI>Fountain open'd</HI> for the full Supply of &s;uch &s;inful mi&s;erable Creatures as we are. The Son of GOD having taken our Nature, and been obedi|ent unto Death, hath purcha&s;ed Grace and Glory, and every good Thing for his People. And accordingly <HI>as Mediator</HI> he hath a Fulne&s;s of all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings to be|&s;tow on his People. Col. 1. 19. <HI>For it plea&s;ed the Father, that in him &s;hould all Fulne&s;s dwell.</HI> And he received that he mignt give. John 1. 16. <HI>And of his Fulne&s;s have all we received and Grace for Grace.</HI> GOD ble&s;&s;eth his People with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in him. And we have accordingly the Ble&s;&s;ings of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah's</HI> Kingdom &s;hadowed forth to us under tho&s;e Similitudes.

Works. Eph. 5. 25&mdash;27. <HI>CHRIST al&s;o loved the Church, and gave him&s;elf for it: that he might &s;anctify and clean&s;e it with the washing of water by the Word, that he might pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any &s;uch Thing; but that it &s;hould be holy and without Blemi&s;h.</HI> Whatever are our &s;piritual Wants, in CHRIST there is a full Supply for us. Are you &s;en&s;ible of your Ignorance and Folly? CHRIST is of GOD made to his People <HI>wi&s;dom.</HI> Are you &s;en&s;ible of your Guilt, and need of a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s for your Ju&s;tification before GOD? CHRIST is of GOD made to his People <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Are you &s;en&s;ible of the dreadful Pollution of Sin, and do you feel your need of that Holine&s;s without which none &s;hall &s;ee the Lord?

<P N="2">2. <HI>It intends tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings which are revealed, and offer|ed in the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>The Go&s;pel of CHRIST, and the Ordinances therein appointed, are as the Conduit-Pipes thro' which GOD is pleas'd to convey the Ble&s;&s;ings purchas'd by CHRIST, unto his cho&s;en People. The <HI>Word, Sacraments</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> are the ordinary Means of Grace: And it is in the diligent U&s;e of the&s;e that GOD's People mu&s;t wait upon him for &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings. Agreably, when it is &s;aid, <HI>Come to the Waters.</HI> I&s;ai. 55. 1. One sen&s;e given of the Place is, "Come to the holy Ordinances." And when GOD is graciou&s;ly pre&s;ent in and with his Ordinances, his People are &s;atisfied with the Fatne&s;s of his Hou&s;e, and made <HI>to drink of the River of his Plea&s;ures.</HI> P&s;. 36. 8. They draw Water out of the Wells of Salva|tion with Joy. But if GOD deny his gracious pre&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing, the&s;e outward Means are as <HI>Wells without Water,</HI> and as Clouds without Rain, which can afford no &s;piritual Refre&s;hment to our Souls.</P>

JESUS communicateth to his People the &s;aving Bene|fits which he hath purcha&s;ed for them. Tit. 3. 5, 6. <HI>Not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which we have done, but according to his Mercy he &s;aved us by the wa&s;hing of Rege|neration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t; Which he &s;hed on us abundantly, thro'</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>our Saviour.</HI> And we accordingly find that the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t was the great and comprehen&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing which our Lord JESUS promi&s;ed to his Di&s;ciples, when he was about to leave this World, and go to the Father. John 16.7. <HI>Neverthele&s;s, I tell you the Truth; it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will &s;end him unto you.</HI> And this glori|ous Per&s;on who is one with the Father and the Son in the e&s;&s;ential Perfections of the divine Nature, is &s;aid to be &s;ent and given with Re&s;pect to the free Communicati|on of his Gifts and Graces and Comforts. And in this Re&s;pect, is he fitly compared to Water in the &s;acred Writings. I&s;a. 44. 3. <HI>I will pour Water upon him that is thir&s;ty, and Floods upon the dry Ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Ble&s;&s;ing upon thine Offspring.</HI> John 7. 37&mdash;39. <HI>In the la&s;t Day, that great Day of the Fea&s;t, Je&s;us &s;tood and cried, &s;aying, If any Man thir&s;t, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath &s;aid, out of his Belly &s;hall flow Rivers of living Water. But this &s;pake he of the Spirit.</HI> And very fitly may the&s;e gracious Influences be compared to Water, living Water; For by the Holy Spirit GOD clean&s;eth the Souls of his People from the moral Defile|ments of Sin, refre&s;heth and reviveth the thir&s;ty, and maketh his People fruitful in &s;piritual Knowledge, Righ|teou&s;ae&s;s and Holine&s;s. When the Spirit is poured on GOD's People from on High, the Wilderne&s;s becometh a fruitful Field. But this brings me to the &s;econd Thing.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>In what Re&s;pects may the &s;aving Benefits of</HI> CHRIST <HI>communicated by the Spirit, be compared to Water of Life?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Upon the Account of the ab&s;olute Need we &s;tand in of them, for our Souls.</HI></P>

Man, our Souls live in a &s;piritual Sen&s;e, without the&s;e Waters of Life. The beginning, Increa&s;e and Perfect on of the &s;piritual Life entirely depend on the&s;e divine In|fluences. Unle&s;s it plea&s;ed GOD to vi&s;it the Earth, and water it; we could not have Food for Man, or Bea&s;t; but mu&s;t peri&s;h with Famine. And without an Intere&s;t in CHRIST, and his &s;aving Benefits, we mu&s;t pine away, and peri&s;h forever in our Sins. This is the one Thing needful.</P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings may be compar'd to Water <HI>for the great Value, and exten&s;ive U&s;efulne&s;s of them.</HI></P>
<P>This Particular is nearly related to the former; how|ever, I &s;hall labour to con&s;ider it with &s;ome Variety.</P>
<P>It is worthy our thankful Ob&s;ervation, that our bounti|ful GOD hath given us tho&s;e Things which are mo&s;t u&s;eful to Mankind in the greate&s;t Abundance, and &s;o made them cheap to us, tho' mo&s;t valuable in them&s;elves; as the Light and Heat of the Sun, the Rain of Heaven, and living Springs of Water from the Earth. Water is of great U&s;e, and exten&s;ive Benefit to us. Our Drink is Water either pure from the Spring, or differently prepared by Nature, or Art. And of how great U&s;e to keep us clean and &s;weet in this dirty World? And if I might be allow'd &s;omething further to enlarge the Metaphor beyond what is e&s;pecially pointed to in the Text, of how great U&s;e is Water for Trade and Commerce? Surely we depend much upon it under GOD, for the Supports and Comforts of Life. But if we con&s;ider the U&s;efulne&s;s of this <HI>Element</HI> after the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Manner, it affords us but a defective Repre&s;entation of the great U&s;efulne&s;s of CHRIST, and his &s;aving Benefits, which comprehend in them a full Supply for all our Spiritual Wants; every Thing we need for the Healing, the Nouri&s;hing &amp; Refre&s;h|ment of our precious Souls; And all of ine&s;timable Va|lue, notwith&s;tanding ignorant and profane Sinners make &s;o &s;mall Account of the&s;e Things, I need not declare to you how plea&s;ant cool Waters are to the thir&s;ty. Such as have been parched under the painful Sen&s;e of GOD's fiery Indignation due for Sin, and then enabled to take the Waters of Life freely, will acknowledge the great Delight and Satisfaction they have received from them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="005057_0010_1016930D761352A0">3. The&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings may be compared to Water of Life, <HI>for their healing, clean&s;ing Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>There are medicinal Waters, <HI>Baths</HI> that have an heal|ing Virtue. And &s;uch are the Waters of the Fountain of Life which is open'd in CHRIST JESUS, and flow down to his People in the gracious Influences of his Spi|rit. The Faculties of our Souls are weakned and depra|ved by Sin. We are in a &s;piritual Sen&s;e <HI>full of Wounds, and Brui&s;es, and putri&s;ying Sores.</HI> See I&s;a. 1. 5, 6. The Eyes are blinded, the Ears are dull of hearing, the Heart is hard, the Pa&s;&s;ions are di&s;tempered with a feveri&s;h Heat of carnal Concupi&s;cence, and the Head is &s;eized as with a deadly Lethargy, which renders us &s;tupid and &s;en&s;e|le&s;s with Re&s;pect to &s;piritual Things. In a Word, The Di&s;ea&s;e is mortal, and unle&s;s a Remedy be provided and applied, the &s;econd Death will follow. But now the&s;e Waters of Life are of &s;overeign Virtue to heal the&s;e Ma|ladies, and all that receive them &s;hall be made whole. There was a <HI>Pool</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> call'd <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> in the U&s;e of which GOD was plea&s;ed miraculou&s;ly to heal the Di&s;ea&s;es of his People. <HI>John</HI> 5. JESUS who&s;e divine Power &s;eem'd to be repre&s;ented by the Waters of this Pool, &s;aw the impotent Man lying by it, and &s;aid to him, <HI>Ri&s;e, take up thy Bed and walk.</HI> ver. 8. We are here a Number of impotent di&s;ea&s;ed Creatures, as it were lying at the Pool, while we are attending the Ordinances of God's Hou&s;e. May the Power of CHRIST be pre&s;ent to heal us! May the&s;e Waters of Life which flow from this Al|mighty Saviour be applied to us to recover us from our &s;piritual Blindne&s;s of Mind, and Hardne&s;s of Heart! you that complain of your &s;piritual Maladies; come to the&s;e Waters; wa&s;h in this <HI>Jordan,</HI> and your Souls &s;hall be clean&s;ed and healed. Thus in <HI>Ezekiel's Vi&s;iion</HI> of the holy Waters, it is &s;aid, that <HI>where the&s;e Waters &s;hall come, they &s;hall be healed.</HI> Ezek. 47. 9.</P>
<P N="4">4. The&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings may be compared to Wa|ter of Life, <HI>as they re&s;tore &s;piritual Life to &s;uch as were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Sinners are in Scripture compar'd to <HI>&s;ick Men,</HI> as the Strength and Beauty of their Souls are impair'd by their &s;piritual Maladies, and yet there is Hope of Recovery by
<PB N="13" REF="005057_0011_101693102FBBC1D0">
CHRIST, the Lord our Healer; And they are compar'd to <HI>dead Men</HI> as they are <HI>wholly depriv'd of &s;piritual Life,</HI> have no true holy Love to GOD or other Graces in them; and are under the Cur&s;e of the Law. And accordingly the Virtue of the&s;e living and Life-giving Waters exceeds all the Powers of Nature. There are Waters in the Kingdom of Nature which have a Virtue to heal &s;ome bodily Maladies by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD's common Pro|vidence upholding and drawing forth the Virtues in them; but none that can re&s;tore Life when the vital Union be|tween Soul and Body is di&s;&s;olved. This Work is wholly &s;upernatural; and &s;o is the &s;piritual Re&s;urrection of Souls, when GOD quickens them that are dead in Sin. Well then may the&s;e divine Influences be called Waters of Life, as they communicate Life to Souis &s;piritually dead. Thus it is &s;aid of tho&s;e holy Waters which ro&s;e and in|crea&s;ed till they became a River which could not be pa&s;&s;ed over. Ezek. 47. 9. <HI>Every Thing &s;hall live whither the River cometh.</HI> When our Lord JESUS poureth out his Spirit, Men are <HI>born of Water, and of the Spirit.</HI> John 3. 5. When the Spirit is thus given like Water, there's a new Life communicated by which true Converts re|&s;emble the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, and live to him; They now receive a Power of &s;piritual Perceptions Operations and Enjoyments, which they had not before. Now they may &s;ay in &s;ome Mea&s;ure with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> Gal. 2. 20. <HI>I live, yet not I, but CHRIST liveth in me; and the Life which I now live in the Fle&s;h, I live by the Faith of the Son of GOD, who loved me and gave him&s;elf for me..</HI> O GOD, thou GOD of Salvation, to whom belong the I&s;&s;ues from Death! Pour out thy Spirit and Ble&s;&s;ing upon us, and we &s;hall live to &s;hew forth thy Prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. The&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings may be compar'd to Water of Life, <HI>as they continue, and &s;pring up into everla&s;ting Life.</HI></P>
<P>Waters &s;ed by living Springs continue, and flow from Age to Age; while Waters from a &s;udden Rain are &s;oon dried up, and fail. Agreeably <HI>Job</HI> complains of his Friends, chap. 6. 15&mdash;17. <HI>My Brethren have dealt de|ceitfully as a Brook, and as the Stream of Brooks they pa&s;s away; Which are blacki&s;h by Rea&s;on of the Ice, and wherein the Snow is bid; What Time they wax warm, they vani&s;h;</HI>

<HI>when it is hot, they are con&s;umed out of their Place.</HI> Such are our Creature-Comforts, they &s;oon become as broken Ci&s;terns which can hold no Water. But now with GOD is the Spring of Life, and the living Waters which flow from him are pure, and they never wholly fail. John 4. 14. <HI>But who&s;oever drinketh of the Water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t; but the Water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall be in him a Well of Water &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting Life.</HI> When our Lord &s;ays, that &s;uch &s;hall never thir&s;t, it can't intend that &s;uch &s;hall have no further De&s;ires after the Graces and Comforts of the Spirit. No, it is a Pro|perty of Grace to de&s;ire to grow and increa&s;e in &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings; But then it may intend that &s;uch as receive this Gift of GOD, &s;hall never more be wholly deprived of it. He may thir&s;t for GOD more and more, and GOD will give the De&s;ires of his Heart. He may com|plain that GOD is withdrawn, but &s;hall never have ju&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;ay that GOD hath wholly for&s;aken him. No, GOD will never leave him 'till he hath rai&s;ed him to his glorious Pre&s;ence in Heaven, where is <HI>Fulne&s;s of Joys, and Plea&s;ures evermore.</HI> He &s;hall never thir&s;t after the Things of this World, as he did before. Such as have ta&s;ted how good and gracious the Lord is, will rather &s;ay as Jer. 18. 14. <HI>Will a Man leave the &s;now of Lebanon which cometh from the Rock of the Field? or &s;hall the cold flowing Waters that come from another Place, be for &s;aken?</HI> No &s;urely, GOD's Children prefer the&s;e pure and living Waters to all the Delights of this Earth which are foul and muddy, and &s;oon pa&s;s away. When the Spirit of GOD is given to dwell in the Hearts of his People, he is in them as a Well of Water, or living Spring that can never be drawn dry. The Spirit of GOD abides in his People forever to maintain and increa&s;e the Life of Grace until it &s;hall be perfected in Glory.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>What is implied in thir&s;ting? Who are they that thir&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>Before I an&s;wer particularly to this Enquiry, I would &s;ay; we all know &s;omething of what natural Thir&s;t means, when we feel a De&s;ire of Drink, of &s;ome natu|ral Moi&s;ture, by Rea&s;on of Drought. Now this hath been
<PB N="15" REF="005057_0013_10169315D593AE80">
accounted one of the mo&s;t peremptory Demands of Na|ture, and &s;uch as &s;oon becometh intolerable if wholly de|nied. Accordingly, We may be &s;aid to thir&s;t in a &s;piri|tual Sen&s;e, when under a painful Sen&s;e of our &s;piritual Wants and Mi&s;eries, we earne&s;tly de&s;ire and long after JESUS CHRIST and his &s;aving Benefits; his Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and the Graces and Comforts of his Spirit.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>It &s;uppo&s;eth a painful Sen&s;e and Feeling of our &s;piri|tual Wants and Mi&s;eries.</HI></P>
<P>When we have been a con&s;iderable Time without Drink, e&s;pecially when hot and weary, we feel the pain|ful Sen&s;e of it. And thus &s;uch as thir&s;t in a &s;piritual Sen&s;e have an afflicting Sen&s;e of their great Wants, in being without CHRIST, de&s;titute of the Graces and Comforts of the Spirit, and expos'd to the Wrath and Cur&s;e of GOD. Indeed the Souls of Men &s;ince the Fall are &s;o blinded and depraved by Sin, that they do not feel their Need of an Intere&s;t in CHRIST, and his &s;aving Benefits; altho' they are pining away in their Iniquities. Give them &s;en&s;ual Satisfactions and earthly Plea&s;ures, and they are ready to imagine that all is well, and that they have need of nothing. As the rich Fool was ready to ble&s;s him&s;elf. Luke 12. 19. <HI>Soul thou ha&s;t much Goods laid up for many Years; take thine Ea&s;e, eat, drink, and be merry.</HI> Thus the &s;ecure Sinner feedeth of A&s;hes, while a de|ceived Heart turns him a&s;ide, that he cant deliver his Soul, nor &s;ay, is there not a Lie in my right Hand? But when the Spirit of GOD convinced Men of their Sin and Mi&s;ery, and &s;hews them their imminent Danger of peri&s;hing for ever; when he binds their Sins upon their Con&s;ciences, and makes them feel &s;omething of the Heat of GOD's Anger; then they find that this World with all its Enjoyments, is a dry and thir&s;ty Land wherein is no Water, no true Satisfaction for their Souls. Now they complain with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 32.4. <HI>Day and Night thy Hand was heavy upon me; My Moi&s;ture is turned into the Drought of &s;ummer.</HI> Now they labour, and are heavy laden under the Burden of their Sins; and are convinced that they mu&s;t langui&s;h and die forever, unle&s;s it plea&s;e GOD to give them CHRIST, and his &s;aving Benefits.
<PB N="16" REF="005057_0014_1016931872A28A28">
They find that in departing from GOD, they have for|&s;aken their own Mercies for lying Vanities, the Fountain of living Waters for broken Ci&s;terns that can hold no Water. The De&s;cription given of them that were pain|ed with Thir&s;t in a proper Sen&s;e, agreeth well with the Condition of the&s;e Sinners. P&s;alm 107. 5. <HI>Thir&s;ty, their Soul fainted in them.</HI> They find that the Threatnings of GOD's fiery Law are pointed at them, while out of CHRIST, and their Conferences are &s;et on Fire as it were with ter|rible Apprehen&s;ions of GOD's Wrath which burns to the lowe&s;t Hell. Their own Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es appear as filthy Rags, altogether in&s;ufficient to cover and defend them. And their outward Performance of religious Du|ties can't give them Relief. They are ready to cry out with the P&s;almi&s;t 38. 3, 4. <HI>There is no Soundne&s;s in my Fle&s;h, becau&s;e of thine Anger, neither is there any Re&s;t in my Bones, becau&s;e of my Sin. For mine Iniquities are gone over my Head: as an heavy Burden they are too heavy for me.</HI> They are perplexed finding them&s;elves in a mi&s;erable Ca&s;e, in a Wilderne&s;s where there is no Water. Their &s;orrowful Ca&s;e is well de&s;cribed I&s;ai. 41. 17. <HI>The Poor and Needy &s;eek Water, and there is none, and their Tongue faileth for Thir&s;t.</HI> Now they are made &s;en&s;ible that unle&s;s the Almighty GOD open a Fountain to them, and &s;up|ply their Wants, they mu&s;t peri&s;h under them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This Thir&s;t implieth, that we earne&s;tly de&s;ire and long after</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and his &s;aving Benefits.</HI></P>
<P>We have King <HI>David</HI>'s Thir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed in longing De&s;ires. 2 Sam. 23. 15. <HI>And David longed, and &s;aid, Oh that one would give me Drink of the Water of the Well of Beth-lehem, which is by the Gate.</HI> Agreeably, when Men thir&s;t after CHRIST, his Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Grace, they have longing De&s;ires after the&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings; yea &s;uch as can not be &s;atisfied with any Thing &s;hort of CHRIST, and the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. Thir&s;t is &s;uch a Demand of Nature as nothing can &s;atisfy but that which is &s;uited to quench it. If you &s;hould offer to one tormented with it, Thou&s;ands of Silver and Gold, this could not make him ea&s;y; He mu&s;t peri&s;h with intolle|rable Pain, unle&s;s you give him Drink. And what Good then could the whole World do him? And thus &s;uch as

thir&s;t after CHRIST, are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their Need of him that nothing can give Re&s;t to their weary Souls but an Intere&s;t in him, and his &s;aving Benefits. Now they are ready to &s;ay, What &s;hall it profit us to gain the World, and lo&s;e our Souls? And what &s;hall we give in Exchange for our Soul? Now they long after CHRIST as the only and All-&s;ufficient Saviour, and are ready to &s;ay, Give us CHRIST, or we die, we are lo&s;t and undone forever. Now the Favour of GOD in CHRIST is in their E&s;teem better than Life, and they &s;ay, <HI>Whom have we in Heaven but thee? There's none upon Earth we de&s;ire be&s;ides thee.</HI> Our Fle&s;h and Heart are ready to fail. O &s;ave us, or we peri&s;h! We have the &s;trong De&s;ires of one pur&s;ued by threatning Evils expre&s;s'd in this Manner. P&s;alm 42. 1, 2. <HI>As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, &s;o panteth my Soul after thee, O GOD. My Soul thir&s;teth for GOD, for the living GOD; when &s;hall I come and appear before GOD?</HI> The Hart or Deer is naturally hot and thir&s;ty, e&s;|pecially when pur&s;ued. In like Manner, when GOD's People find them&s;elves pur&s;ued by deadly Enemies, and have been wearied in &s;eeking Relief from Creatures, and then are convinced that there's Re&s;t for their weary Souls in CHRIST alone; they long after him, and the Influ|ences of his <HI>Spirit.</HI> Now the Lord JESUS is precious to them as he &s;aveth from Sin, and the Wrath to come; as he gives Pardon and Peace, Grace and Comfort. And they pant after the living Waters he be&s;tows; yea, the&s;e De&s;ires are active, and powerfully incline the Thir&s;ty to &s;eek JESUS early, and the Favour of GOD in him. Thus when <HI>David</HI> thir&s;ted for GOD, he &s;ays, <HI>Early will I &s;eek thee.</HI> Nor can &s;uch be &s;atisfied till they obtain an Inter|e&s;t in CHRIST, and his &s;aving Benefits.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Thir&s;ty are &s;atisfied when</HI> CHRIST <HI>draweth nigh to them, and communicates the Graces and Comforts of his Spirit to their Souls.</HI></P>
<P>Cool Waters are not &s;o plea&s;ant to the Thir&s;ty, as CHRIST and his Grace are to &s;uch as labour and are heavy laden under the Sen&s;e of Sin. When the Son of GOD reveals him&s;elf to &s;uch as their only Saviour, they find Re&s;t and Refre&s;hment in him, as in one every Way able to &s;upply their &s;piritual Wants, and fill their empty Souls with Good.
<PB N="18" REF="005057_0016_101692F119760160">
Now they begin to feel the Truth and &s;trong Con&s;olation of tho&s;e Words, John 6. 34. <HI>And he &s;aid unto them, I am the Bread of Life; be that cometh to me &s;hall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, &s;hall never thir&s;t.</HI> Indeed they de&s;ire the Favour of GOD in CHRIST more and more; but then they re&s;olve they will go no whither el&s;e for the Waters of Life; In him they happily find a Fountain opened that can never be drawn dry. And the Lan|guage of their Souls is, ever give us this Water, give thy Spirit more abundantly. When the royal P&s;almi&s;t had &s;aid to GOD, <HI>my Fle&s;h longeth for thee in a dry and thir&s;ty Land, where no Water is;</HI> He well expre&s;&s;eth the Satisfaction he &s;hould take in the Communications of GOD's Favour, P&s;alm 63. 3. <HI>Becau&s;e thy loving Kindne&s;s is better than Life; my Lips &s;hall prai&s;e thee.</HI> And V. 5. <HI>My Soul &s;hall be &s;atisfied as with Marrow and Fatne&s;s; and my Mouth &s;hall prai&s;e thee with joyful Lips.</HI> How re|fre&s;hing are Pardon and Grace to &s;uch as were ready to &s;ink under the heavy Burden of Sin! O how chearfully do they &s;ubmit to CHRIST's Yoke finding it ea&s;y, and his Burden light, compared with that intollerable Load which before lay upon them. I tru&s;t I may appeal to the Experience of Numbers here pre&s;ent, and inquire whether you have not found more true Satisfaction in looking to JESUS CHRIST in the Exerci&s;e of Faith and godly Sorrow for Sin, than ever you did in gratifying your fooli&s;h and hurtful Lu&s;ts, Mat. 5. 6. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they which do hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s; for they &s;hall be filled.</HI> CHRIST, his Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Grace fill and &s;atisfy the Soul. When Men pant after the Things of this World as their cho&s;en Portion and Happine&s;s, they are deluded as with Dreams and Shadows. That De&s;cription agreeth well to their Ca&s;e, I&s;a. 29.8. <HI>It &s;hall be even as when a hun|gry Man dreameth, and behold he eateth; but he awaketh, and behold his Soul is empty; Or as when a thir&s;ty Man dreameth, and behold he drinketh; but he awaketh, and be|hold he is faint, and his Soul hath Appetite.</HI> But when thir&s;ty Souls drink of the Water of Life, they obtain &s;ome fore-ta&s;tes of the Joys of Heaven, P&s;alm 36. 8. <HI>They &s;hall be abundantly &s;atisfied with the Fatne&s;s of thy Hou&s;e; and thou &s;hall make them drink of the River of thy Plea&s;ure;.</HI></P>

Accordingly we may under this Head of Di&s;cour&s;e inquire 1. What is implied in coming or going to CHRIST? 2.

<P N="1">1. <HI>What is implied in coming, or going to</HI> CHRIST? <HI>Or what is the coming to Chri&s;t here pre&s;&s;ed upon us?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>It is a &s;piritual Motion of the Soul by which the Be|liever, for &s;aking other Things, repairs unto</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>to tru&s;t in him alone for Salvation, upon the Command and Promi&s;e of GOD's Word.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is a &s;piritual Motion of the Soul.</HI></P>
<P>It is in the Exerci&s;e of Faith that we go to JESUS CHRIST. Thus our Saviour him&s;elf explains the Meta|phor. John 6. 35. <HI>He that cometh to me &s;hall never bur|ger; and he that believeth on me, &s;ball never thir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>In going to</HI> CHRIST, <HI>mu&s;t for &s;ake other Thing; as vain and unable to &s;ave us.</HI></P>
<P>Men are very prone to place carnal Confidence in their earthly Enjoyments, in them&s;elves, in their outward reli|gious Privileges, Duties, and Reformations. But in order to our going to CHRIST, we mu&s;t be convinced that a

vain &s;hall we hope for Salvation from the&s;e Things; and accordingly we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e are but Refuges of Lies, if placed in the Room of CHRIST; And therefore while we wait upon GOD in the U&s;e of the Means of Grace, we mu&s;t take heed we do not <HI>&s;top here;</HI> but mu&s;t fly to CHRIST as the only City of Refuge, when the Law, and our own Con&s;ciences condemn us, We mu&s;t go to JESUS, &s;en&s;ible that there is <HI>none other Name under Heaven among Men whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved.</HI> Acts 4.12.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>We mu&s;t tru&s;t in</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>alone, and have our whole Dependance on him for Salvation</HI></P>

<P>The Father of Glory hath given his only begotten Son to die for us.

<P>Such, we have heard, are invited to come, and a&s;&s;ured they &s;hall be welcome. Let us then examine whether we have had a painful Sen&s;e of our &s;piritual Wants and Mi&s;eries? Have we felt the Burden of our Sins, and been convinced, that we mu&s;t peri&s;h forever unle&s;s GOD re|lieve us? Have we accordingly longed after CHRIST, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Grace, as the Ble&s;&s;ings which alone can &s;atisfy our thir&s;ty Souls? Are we bro't off from tru&s;ting to our own Duties and Privileges? And can we now &s;ay that nothing &s;hort of an Intere&s;t in CHRIST &s;hall &s;atisfy us? Do we thus continue following the Lord, re&s;olving by his Grace that we will never go from him to &s;eek our Happine&s;s in Creatures? But that if he ca&s;ts us off, we will go mourning all our Days. If this be the Ca&s;e, GOD will &s;ooner or later &s;atisfy the longing Soul.

What you have to do is in a believing humble Manner to receive what is freely offered you. And here I may further &s;ay, that the more pre&s;&s;ing and urgent your Nece&s;&s;ities are, the more Ha&s;te you &s;hould make to CHRIST; and the deeper Sen&s;e you have of the&s;e Wants, the greater Encou|ragement have you that you &s;hall be made welcome; for thus runs the Promi&s;e, P&s;alm 81. 10. <HI>Open thy Mouth wide, and I will fill it.</HI> The Fountain is &s;till open, and full as ever. The Merits and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST have lo&s;t nothing of their Virtue, by being communicated to &s;uch va&s;t Numbers; and the Influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of GOD are as powerful to clean&s;e and refre&s;h your Souls, as ever they were. And I may add, that the pre&s;ent <HI>remarkable Day of Grace,</HI> in which GOD is giving &s;piri|tual Ble&s;&s;ings with a liberal Hand, may well encourage you to go to GOD as to a Fountain opened in CHRIST for the Supply of all your Wants. O be per&s;uaded then to hearken and con&s;ider, to hear and obey the Calls of the Go&s;pel, that your Souls may live! O let it not be &s;aid that while many others thankfully accept the Invitations of the Go&s;pel, that you reject them. <HI>How &s;hall you e&s;cape, if you neglect &s;o great Salvation?</HI> Certainly you will not be able to e&s;cape the Damnation of Hell; yea, you mu&s;t

receive a double Damnation, as you are under the Cur&s;e of the Law, and will then be found De&s;pi&s;ers of the Grace of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let tho&s;e of us who are invited to &s;it down at the Lord's Table the next Sabbath, look to it that we go to that holy Fea&s;t with earne&s;t De&s;ires after Chri&s;t, and the Ble&s;&s;ings which flow from his Death.</HI></P>
<P>In this Ordinance we have a Fea&s;t on that Sacrifice which CHRIST offered once for all, and are invited to eat and drink his Fle&s;h and Blood after a &s;piritual Manner, which are Meat and Drink indeed. But then, we mu&s;t open our Hearts to the Lord Je&s;us, then he will come in to us, and will &s;up with us, and we with him. <HI>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up, ye everla&s;ting Doors, and the King of Glory &s;hall come in.</HI> P&s;al. 24. 7. Let every Heart be con&s;ecrated as a living Temple unto him, then this King of Glory will be both our Companion, and our Fea&s;t. He will &s;ay to us, as Cant. 5. 1. <HI>Eat, O Friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly, O Beloved.</HI> And by Com|munion with the Father and the Son in this holy Ordi|nance, we &s;hall be prepared for that glorious Place and State of which we read, Rev. 7. 15&mdash;17. <HI>Therefore are they before the Throne of GOD, and &s;erve him Day and Night in his Temple; and he that &s;itteth on the Throne &s;hall dwell among them. They &s;hall hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more, neither &s;hall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat. For the Lamb which is in the mid&s;t of the Throne, &s;hall feed them, and &s;hall lead them unto Fountains of living Waters; and GOD &s;hall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</HI></P>
