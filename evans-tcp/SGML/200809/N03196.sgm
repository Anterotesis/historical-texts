<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_AS there is no Salvation but in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, nor any other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby they mu&s;t be Saved, &s;o it mu&s;t needs be the greate&s;t Mercy to Mankind to en|joy that Go&s;pel which reveals this Savi|our, &amp; the Way to Eternal Life by him. And as tho&s;e who are thus highly favoured, &s;hould with all thankfulne&s;s acknowledge this Sovereign Di|&s;tinction of divine Grace, in revealing the&s;e things un|to them, &s;o they ought, and if they have the true Spirit of Chri&s;t and his Go&s;pel, will pity tho&s;e of their Fellow Creatures who are de&s;titute of the Means of Light, and are peri&s;hing for lack of Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>And it is ju&s;t matter of Lamentation to think that when we are &s;o remarkably Ble&s;&s;ed with the Light and Grace of the Go&s;pel, there &s;hould be &s;o many Tribes and Nations of the <HI>Aborigines</HI> of this Land, within or ju&s;t upon our Borders, who do &s;till walk in Heath|eni&s;h Darkne&s;s, and dwell in the Region of the Shadow of Death, with little or no Light &s;pringing up unto them, unle&s;s what &s;ome of them have by the <HI>Romi&s;h Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> which Light is but Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>And it is doubtle&s;s to our Reproach, as betraying a want of that Gratitude to Chri&s;t, and Love and Charity to Mankind, which his Grace teaches, that there has been no more done by US for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel among them. E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider how much we have been outdone by the <HI>French,</HI> and tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in this Matter. For how &s;hall we an&s;wer it, that when they have been at &s;o much Co&s;t
<PB N="ii" REF="003867_0004_100206FA1AC86A30">
and Pains for Propagating their Super&s;tition, we have been at &s;o little for the promoting that Religion of Je&s;us, which before God and the Father is pure &amp; undefiled.</P>
<P>But <HI>how &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher? and how &s;hall they Preach except they be &s;ent?</HI> To which I may add, How &s;hall they be &s;ent unle&s;s God &s;ends them? For Men qualified for this Service are as it were with one Con&s;ent making their Excu&s;e. And it is God alone that can incline the Hearts of any to engage in &s;uch a difficult and Self-de|nying Service. And whenever any Per&s;ons are in&s;pired with &s;o much Zeal for the Honour and Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, tender Pity and fervent Charity to tho&s;e uncivilized as well as ungo&s;pelized People, as to live among them and Preach the Go&s;pel to them, God mu&s;t have the Glory of it.</P>
<P>And &s;uch an One we tru&s;t Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> is, who notwith&s;tanding the agreeable Bu&s;ine&s;s he was in as a Tutor of <HI>Yale-College,</HI> and his having as fair a pro&s;|pect as any Candidate for the Mini&s;try what&s;oever, to have an agreeable Settlement in any of the Churches that &s;hould need a Pa&s;tor; yet voluntarily devoted him|&s;elf to the Service of Chri&s;t and of the poor <HI>Indians;</HI> and more e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are at or near <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc.</HI></P>
<P>And now with re&s;pect to <HI>this Tribe</HI> of Indians, their Number, Scituation, and other Circum&s;tances relating to them; and particularly the Manner how they came fir&s;t to be di&s;po&s;ed to receive the Go&s;pel, and how Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> as a Mini&s;ter, and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> as a School Ma&s;ter, were introduced among them, and enter|tained by them, and the hopeful Pro&s;pects there are of the Go&s;pel's &s;preading and prevailing in tho&s;e dark and ignorant Parts of the Land, will be&s;t appear in a par|ticular Narrative hereof given by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Stephen Williams</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> in a Letter of <HI>June 24 1735.</HI> to a Gentleman then in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which for the Enter|tainment of the Reader, is here in&s;erted, and is as follows. viz.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Concern you &s;eemed to have on your Mind, for the Welfare of the <HI>Aboriginal</HI> Na|tives of this Country (when I la&s;t &s;aw you at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>) is the Occa&s;ion, of my troubling of you with &s;ome Account of the good Di&s;po&s;ition there is in the River Indians (as they are called) to receive the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And here before I proceed, it is needful to inform you, that this Clan of Indians (who&s;e Prince or Chief Sagamore was the late <HI>Etouocoam,</HI> one of the Indian Kings that went to <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Queen Ann's</HI> Reign) live upon <HI>Hud&s;on's River,</HI> below <HI>Albany</HI>; and their Bounds extends Ea&s;t, &s;o as to reach to <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> (which is the South-We&s;t part of our Government) and to a Place called <HI>Weteoge</HI> (that is the North-We&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Government) &s;o that thay live in the three Governments. They are the mo&s;t nu|merous Tribe of Indians that I am acquainted with. They can rai&s;e (I am told) three or four hundred Men. But having thus informed you, I proceed to tell you, that there live &s;everal Fa|milies of the&s;e Indians at <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI>; among&s;t whom there are two Indians of note, the one is named <HI>Cuncaupot,</HI> the other <HI>Umpecheny. Cuncaupot</HI> has been honoured by Governor BELCHER with a Captain's Commi&s;&s;ion, and <HI>Umpecheny</HI> with a Lieu|tenant's. When they received their Commi&s;&s;ions (which was at <HI>Springfield,</HI> in <HI>May</HI> 1734) I made them a Vi&s;it, and found them grave, de&s;irable, prudent Men; the Captain then 42 Years of Age, the Lieutenant 38. In Conver&s;ation with them, I found that Capt <HI>Cuncaupot</HI> was apprehen&s;ive that the Religion of his Fore-fathers was not right. But yet he did not know how to think well of the Chri&s;tian Religion, becau&s;e the Chri&s;tians (many of them) lead immoral Lives I improved the &s;hort time I had with them, in di&s;cour&s;ing a|bout
<PB N="iv" REF="003867_0006_10020700A0EECD28">
Religion, and removing their Objections, and asked them when I left them, whether they &s;hould be willing to &s;ee me at their own Country? They &s;aid they &s;hould, and would go home and tell their People what had been &s;aid by me, and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> who was with me part of the time of conver&s;ing with them. I informed his Excellency Governor BELCHER, and the Ho|nourable and Reverend Commi&s;&s;ioners of the In|dian Affairs, of this matter, who encouraged and directed my going up to &s;ee them. And in <HI>July</HI> 1734, I went up to their Country, accompanied with the Reverend Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> of <HI>We&s;tfield.</HI> Capt. <HI>Cuncaupot,</HI> and his Kin&s;man Lieut <HI>Umpecheny,</HI> ma|nife&s;ted great Joy at &s;eeing us. They gathered their People together the next Day, after we got to <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc,</HI> with whom we di&s;cour&s;ed about Religious Matters. They told us they would con|&s;ider what had been &s;aid, and give us an An&s;wer in four Days; the mo&s;t of which time was &s;pent in con&s;ulting together, con&s;idering and weighing what had been &s;aid to them. When we met them again, I preached a &s;hort Sermon to them, which was interpreted Sentence by Sentence. They gave good Attention to what was &s;aid. After the Exerci&s;e was over, all that were pre&s;ent (which was the <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> Families) gave in their Names to us, with their de&s;ire that &s;ome Body might be &s;ent to in&s;truct and teach them the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion: Upon which I gave them a Belt of Wam|pum, which they received as a Pledge, that I would do their Me&s;&s;age to the Governour, &amp;c. It would be too tedious, to give you an Account how they managed them&s;elves in their Debates on what was offered to them; and what Argu|ments (we under&s;tood) were urged for or again&s;t receiving the Chri&s;tian Religion. But I can't omit informing you, we were told, that an Indian (who&s;e Name is <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> and who has &s;ince made
<PB N="v" REF="003867_0007_1002663182508B68">
a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and received Bapti&s;m) offered thus to his Countrymen, viz. <HI>The Indians</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>continue &s;till in their Heatheni&s;m, notwith&s;tanding the Go&s;pel has been bro't &s;o near them, and they are greatly dimini&s;hed; &s;o that</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>&s;ince my remembrance, there were Ten Indians, where there is now One: But the Chri&s;tians greatly increa&s;e and multiply, and &s;pread over the Land; let us there|fore leave our former Cour&s;es and become Chri&s;tians,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Soon after my return home I went to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and waited upon His Excellency and the Honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners; who were &s;o &s;atisfied with the ac|count given them, that they de&s;ired the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> and me, to look out &s;ome &s;uitable Per&s;on, to be employ'd as a Mi&s;&s;ionary, among that People. We undertook the Affair; and Divine Providence led us to the learned, pious &amp; ingenious Mr. <HI>John Sargent,</HI> one of the Tutors of <HI>Yale College,</HI> whom God had inclined to &s;uch a &s;elf-denying, difficult Service. He went up to <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> in <HI>Octob.</HI> 1734, accompanied by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> to introduce him. When Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> arrived at <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc,</HI> the Indians immediately &s;et up a School-hou&s;e, and a con&s;iderable number of them began to learn their Primers. Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> (who is one of the mo&s;t &s;ui|table Per&s;ons for &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s, that I know of) was very agreable to the Indians, got a great intere&s;t in their Affections, &s;o that the Captain &amp; Lieutenant each of them, &s;ent a Son with him to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> tho' at an Hundred Miles di&s;tance, to live with him the Winter Sea&s;on (for Mr <HI>Sargent</HI> returned to Col|lege to take care of the Senior Cla&s;s). When Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> came away, Mr. <HI>Timothy Woodbridge</HI> went up to keep the School, who &s;pent the Winter with them, who has done very good Service in bringing them on in their Reading, and in in&s;tructing them Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion. He taught them the Catechi&s;m of Dr. <HI>Watts.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="003867_0008_10026634057314A0">In the Winter pa&s;t, the whole Nation of the Ri|ver Indians met by their Delegates at <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> to examine what the <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> Indians were do|ing. Capt. <HI>Cuncaupot,</HI> and Lieut. <HI>Umpecheny</HI> were fearful they &s;hould be frowned upon, and have Ob|jections ca&s;t in their way, which they &s;hould not be able to remove, and therefore &s;ent to &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters de&s;iring they would come up. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI> and I went up in the middle of Win|ter to &s;ee them. There were a&s;&s;embled together One hundred and fifty or Two hundred Per&s;ons, Young &amp; Old; and among them <HI>Corlair,</HI> the chief Sachem of the whole Nation. I preached two Ser|mons to them on the Sabbath. It was one of the grave&s;t, and mo&s;t attentive Auditories that ever I preached to. We had divers Conferences with the Indians, and read to them a Letter from the Hon. <HI>John Stoddard,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and endeavoured to an&s;wer their Objections, &amp;c. And &s;o far &s;atisfied tho&s;e that came from other Places, that they thanked us for the pains we had taken; and de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Wood|bridge</HI> might continue among them, and that Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> would return to them, and &s;aid they would give an account to their &s;everal Towns, of what we had offered to them, yea gave us Encouragement that they would as a Nation &s;ubmit to In&s;truction. Soon after we left them, a pleuretick Fever &s;eized &s;everal of them, and two of them died with it: When they were Sick, they de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> the School-ma&s;ter to pray with &amp; for them. And tho&s;e that died (before their Death) de&s;ired they might be buried in the Chri&s;tian Burying-place, and after the Engli&s;h manner: And according to their de&s;ire, they were; and without the Indian How|lings and Lamentations and Ceremonies.</P>
<P>Sometime in <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, they &s;ent a Letter to the Mini&s;ters that had vi&s;ited them, which was dicta|ted by them, tho' written by an Engli&s;hman: in it they have the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>We do humbly thank
<PB N="vii" REF="003867_0009_1002663798DBA5C0">
you for your care and kindne&s;s towards us in in&s;truct|ing us in the Chri&s;tian Religion; which we acknow|ledge to be the be&s;t Religion in the World; and the Religion which we intend to &s;tand by &amp; follow as long as we live: Altho' there are a great many difficulties in the way, yet we have no thought of giving out,</HI> &amp;c. This was &s;igned by <HI>Cuncaupot, Umpecheny,</HI> and &s;e|veral others. In the Spring Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> returned to them again, and was received by them with a great deal of Joy. And he writes to me thus, viz. <HI>I find</HI> (I think) <HI>a better Di&s;po&s;ition in the Indians here, towards Chri&s;tianity, than I left them in. The Scho|lars, many of them, have made con&s;iderable Progre&s;s in their Learning: And the Number of them is increa&s;ed to near Forty. There is Bu&s;ine&s;s enough for two Men,</HI> &amp;c. Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> in a Letter tells me, that &s;e|veral Indians from other Plantations have come, and joined to them.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you a &s;hort and imperfect Account of an Affair, that I have been &s;omething concerned in; and which has co&s;t me, with the other Mini&s;ters, &s;ome hundreds of Miles travel. I have been &s;olicitous for the Welfare of the poor Heathen, ever &s;ince I was a Pri&s;oner with them, and have with Concern ob&s;erved the little pro&s;pect there has been of bringing any of them to receive the Prote&s;tant Religion, by our Mi&s;&s;ionaries at the Forts, where the Indians make but &s;hort &s;tays, and are either drunk or bu&s;y about their Trade, all the while they tarry. And the Indians that frequent our Truck-Hou&s;es, are generally &s;uch as are poi|&s;ioned by the Je&s;uits, who have a great a&s;cendant over them; as the Rev. Mr. <HI>Seccombe</HI> ob&s;erves, in a Letter I have &s;een of his. But I can't but think, there is a hopeful pro&s;pect of much Good being done to the&s;e River Indians, if prudent Mea&s;ures are pur&s;ued: For they are well di&s;po&s;ed to receive the Chri&s;tian Religion; have never been poi&s;oned by the Je&s;uits (for their Scituation is &s;uch, that the
<PB N="viii" REF="003867_0010_1002070328B92FA8">
Je&s;uits can't come among them, without pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Albany</HI>) There are among them &s;everal Per&s;ons of good Morals, remarkable for their Truth, Ju&s;tice, yea and Temperance (tho' Intemperance is the Indians National Vice). They have an Affection for the Engli&s;h, e&s;pecially for tho&s;e who take pains to In&s;truct them. Their Children are de&s;irous to learn to Read, &amp;c&mdash;Are very mannerly &s;ince they have been at School. I don't know what a Fund the Commi&s;&s;ioners have to &s;upport their Mi&s;&s;iona|ries, but Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> &s;eem very willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent in this good Work, if they can be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o as to be enabled to go on with it. Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> in his la&s;t Letter to me ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus, <HI>I hope the Commi&s;&s;ioners will &s;upport Mr.</HI> Woodbridge <HI>and me here, &s;o as that we can attend upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s without Di&s;traction; for I hope we &s;hall find a Door continually open to &s;erve God and Mankind to &s;ome good Effect.</HI> And I am &s;atisfied that the honourable the Commi&s;&s;ioners will be willing, if they have a Fund &s;ufficient to do it, and to an&s;wer their other nece&s;&s;ary Charges at <HI>Na|tick,</HI> &amp;c. But I can't but hope (if the Fund is not &s;ufficient) that God will rai&s;e up Friends, &amp; increa&s;e the Stock, &s;ince &s;uch a wide, and (I hope) <HI>effectual Door is opened,</HI> and God has led to &s;o &s;uitable a Per&s;on as the worthy Mr. <HI>Sargent,</HI> who has told me, he &s;hould choo&s;e to &s;erve his Redeemer in &s;uch Ser|vice, if there was a pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, rather than any other Way. The difficulty of the Service, the hard&s;hip he mu&s;t undergo, dwelling in the Wilder|ne&s;s, and out of the Way of his learned Acquain|tance, don't di&s;hearten and di&s;courage him. He is a Gentleman of &s;uch Parts and Learning, and &s;o remarkable for his Piety, that any of our de&s;ti|tute Churches would be fond of him, but he will not allow any of them, to think of diverting him from the good Work he is engaged in.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Though I am not &s;o happy as to have much per|&s;onal Acquaintance with you, yet your known Character in general, and e&s;pecially your Relation to the Affair I have been ingaged in, has made me hope, I &s;hall have your Pardon for the Trouble I now give you.</P>
<P>'Tis but lately that I have returned from <HI>Hou&s;&s;a|tonnoc</HI>; and I doubt not but you will rejoyce to be informed of the happy Succe&s;s, God has been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s the Endeavours with, that have been u&s;ed to convert the Heathen there to the Chri&s;tian Faith. The De&s;ign has hitherto &s;ucceed|ed beyond Expectation. They are I think now re&s;olved to be Chri&s;tians, and have an earne&s;t de|&s;ire to be taught. The fondne&s;s they &s;hew for me is &s;urpri&s;ing; and con&s;idering how much a Stran|ger
<PB N="x" REF="003867_0012_10020708A64B0A20">
I am to them, their own barbarous Education, and how little I have done to win them, there ap|pears &s;omething more than humane in it.</P>
<P>I am very willing (if the Gentlemen Commi&s;&s;io|ners plea&s;e) to devote my Life to the Service of their Souls. If God give &s;ucce&s;s in it, it will be the great|e&s;t &s;atisfaction to me.&mdash; There is now, and I hope will be Work enough for two: I wi&s;h therefore Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> may be maintained there with me.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> will but ju&s;t pay the nece&s;&s;ary Charges of living: for the Ne|ce&s;&s;aries of Life, are and mu&s;t be dear in that re|mote part of the Country. But I make my &s;elf ea&s;y in that matter, a&s;&s;uring my &s;elf, that (if there be Money) the Gentlemen betru&s;ted with that affair, will do what is rea&s;onable. Money alone is no temptation to me at all, to devote my &s;elf to &s;uch a Life, yet 'tis but rea&s;onable, I think, to expect to be &s;upported, &s;o as to have no other care, than to attend the bu&s;ine&s;s I &s;hall go about.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> (I perceive) have a mind to be baptized: <HI>Cuncaupot</HI> e&s;pecially, who appears to me, to be well qualified for it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> Indian School-ma&s;ter at <HI>Hou&s;|&s;atonnoc,</HI> upon &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, left his School, a few days, and has been with us. And the account he gave is &s;o encouraging, that I am &s;en|&s;ible it will be grateful to you, and therefore &s;end it.</P>
<P>He informs me that &s;everal of the <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> Indians have lately been to the We&s;tward as far as <HI>Si&s;cohannah,</HI> which they &s;ay is &s;ix Hundred Miles, and upon their return they &s;ay, that the Indians, thro' that large &s;pace, are generally di&s;&s;atisfied with their own ways of Religion; and are di&s;po&s;ed to inquire after &s;ome other way of Salvation, than ever they have been acquainted with.</P>
<P>He informs me further, that the River Indians (of which tho&s;e at <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> are a part) fre|quently vi&s;it their Brethren at <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc,</HI> take great notice of what is doing there; none of them oppo&s;e it, they generally approve of it: and many of them expre&s;s their de&s;igns of coming to &s;ettle there; and &s;ome have put &s;uch a de&s;ign in execu|tion already, and are upon the &s;pot: So that the number of Scholars, now actually under In&s;truction is upwards of Forty. And he adds, that he is per|&s;waded, if the Indians could be accommodated with a proper quantity of Land, there would, in a little time, be a Congregation of &s;everal Hundreds of them wor&s;hiping GOD there.</P>
<P>That the Indians at <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> continue in a fixed re&s;olution to &s;eek after knowledge in the Chri&s;tian Religion, and to live in the practice of it; and have made great proficiency for the time.</P>
<P>That Capt. <HI>Cuncaupot</HI> &s;eems to be overjoy'd to &s;ee the good di&s;po&s;ition there is in his Brethren, to em|brace the Chri&s;tian Religion. Religion &s;eems evi|dently to be next his Heart: And he, with &s;ome others of them, de&s;ire to be baptized. &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="003867_0014_1002663E47E74CD8">That Lieut. <HI>Umpecheny</HI>'s Wife and others, have wept more than once, upon heating divine Truths: And &s;he e&s;pecially has her Heart very much upon this Affair. She is al&s;o greatly engaged in learning to read: She will not fail of reading as often as any Scholar; and urges that &s;he may read a little further, and a little further; &s;o that Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> tells me, it grieves him to the very Heart, that he is obliged almo&s;t to force her from him, that he may have time to hear the re&s;t of the Scholars. Other Women there are al&s;o, who di&s;cover much of the &s;ame good di&s;po&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> the Captain's Wi&s;e, the Lieutenant's Wife's Si&s;ter, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He further informs me, that there came an In|dian, a little while ago, from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River, named <HI>Nompeh,</HI> about Thirty Years old, a Man of very &s;ingular Gravity, and began to learn to Read; he knew his Letters when he came, and that was all: He applied him&s;elf to the bu&s;ine&s;s with the utmo&s;t attention, and has made great progre&s;s &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e things give us rea&s;on to hope that the Hand of GOD is in, and his ble&s;&s;ing upon that Affair. That it may &s;ucceed to the &s;aving benefit of tho&s;e poor Indians, is the ardent de&s;ire of</P>

<P>Such a general inclination &amp; de&s;ire as appears in the&s;e Indians to be In&s;tructed in the things of God, and to be taught to Read, in order to their coming at a fuller know|ledge of the&s;e things, is &s;o uncommon &amp; extraordinary, that there &s;eems plainly to be the finger of God in it. And the Honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners who have the di&s;po&s;al of the Monies, annually &s;ent over, for the propagating the Go&s;|pel among the Indians, have been &s;o far plea&s;ed with the&s;e Accounts, that they have readily done what they thought proper, for the encouraging and &s;upporting both Mr. <HI>Sar|gent</HI> and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> in their re&s;pective Services.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="003867_0015_1002070A99BD2068">And as it was tho't highly proper, according to Mr. <HI>Sargent's</HI> propo&s;al, that he &s;hould be Ordained; &s;o His Excellency the <HI>GOVERNOUR,</HI> who is at the Head of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, was plea&s;ed &s;o to order the matter, as to have a very favourable Opportunity for it. For His <HI>Excellency</HI> having propo&s;ed a Treaty at <HI>Deerfield</HI> with &s;ome of the Indian Tribes, he gave orders to the Indians at <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> to meet him there; accordingly the <HI>Governour,</HI> attended with a large Committee of the Ho|nourable His Maje&s;ty's Council, and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives, and many other Gentlemen, was at <HI>Deerfield</HI> on <HI>Augu&s;t 25;</HI> And that Week being taken up in the Treaty with the Indians, in ratifying the Peace &amp; Friend|&s;hip between us and them; and in giving and receiving the u&s;ual Pledges of it; and Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> not coming to Town till the Friday Evening, it was judged proper to have the Ordination on the Lord's Day, which was ac|cordingly carried on in the forenoon of the &s;aid Day, by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> and the other Mini&s;ters then pre&s;ent, at the de&s;ire, and in the pre&s;ence of His <HI>Excellency,</HI> and the honourable Gentlemen of the General Court, and others that attended him thither, to|gether with the A&s;&s;embly of Chri&s;tians u&s;ually meeting in that Place, and many of the Indians who were grave Spectators of the Solemnity, and the <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc In|dians,</HI> who &s;at by them&s;elves, and attended throughout the whole Service with great Seriou&s;ne&s;s; and were much plea&s;ed to &s;ee One whom they had &s;uch a love for, &s;o &s;o|lemnly &s;eparated to the Service of their Souls.</P>
<P>The Service was carried on in the following order, <HI>viz.</HI> the Reverend Mr. <HI>A&s;hley</HI> of <HI>Deerfield</HI> began with Prayer: and as by the Governour's Invitation, I waited on him in his Journey, &s;o by His Excellency's Order I preached the Sermon, which by His authority and Influence is here made publick: The <HI>Charge</HI> was given by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield</HI>: and the <HI>Fellow|&s;hip of the Elders</HI> by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Springfield:</HI> and the Exerci&s;e concluded with a Song of

Prai&s;e: and the &s;olemn Benediction of the People in the Name of the Lord, by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Sargent.</HI></P>
<P>And now; May this Servant of the Lord prove a cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el to bear Chri&s;t's Name among the Heathen, for many Years to come! May his Life and Health be precious in the &s;ight of God!

<P>If a man therefore purge him&s;elf from the&s;e, he &s;hall be a ve&s;&s;el unto honour, &s;anctified and meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and prepared unto every good work.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE great Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles is giving many excellent directions, earne&s;t exhortations, and &s;olemn cautions and charges unto his &s;on <HI>Timothy,</HI> in this as well as the fore|going epi&s;tle, in order to his faith|ful, acceptable and &s;ucce&s;sful di&s;charge of his e|vangelical office.</P>
<P>And among other things, in &s;ome of the ver&s;es of the preceeding context, he cautions him parti|cularly again&s;t <HI>profane and vain babblings</HI>; that is in general again&s;t all vain, empty, and impertinent di&s;cour&s;es in the di&s;charge of the mini&s;terial office, &amp;c. More e&s;pecially, it is a caution again&s;t his delivering any fal&s;e doctrines, and &s;preading any errors in and by his Sermons; which in&s;tead of promoting true re|ligion, would only &s;erve to <HI>increa&s;e unto more ungod|line&s;s</HI>; and fill the world with corrupt principles, and fal&s;e notions, to the de&s;troying their virtue rather than to the promoting of it.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003867_0018_100266414DA4A918">And here the Apo&s;tle to back his caution, in&s;tances in two that probably were teachers in the church, viz. <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Philetus,</HI> who had erred from the truth, and were for teaching their error to others, which was this, viz. <HI>that the re&s;urrection was pa&s;s'd al|ready,</HI> as at our Saviour's re&s;urrection; or by turning all that was &s;aid concerning the re&s;urrection into meer allegory, making it intend only our regeneration, or our being rai&s;ed to newne&s;s of life; or that the re&s;urrection is only in procreation whereby the &s;pecies is continued.</P>
<P>And now &s;uch erroneous doctrines, and &s;uch fal&s;e teachers, the apo&s;tle exhorts <HI>Timothy</HI> to &s;hun &amp; avoid, if he would be a good mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But upon it ob&s;erves, That it was no great wonder, if there were &s;ome &s;uch hereticks and fal&s;e teachers in the church; for it was no more than we &s;hould meet with in any great hou&s;e, ve&s;&s;els, or uten&s;ils of different kinds, &s;ome to honour and &s;ome to di&s;honour; as in the ver&s;e preceeding my text: <HI>In a great hou&s;e</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>there are not only ve&s;&s;els of gold, and of &s;ilver, but al&s;o of wood, and of earth; and &s;ome to honour, and &s;ome to di&s;honour.</HI> And then comes in the words of my text, <HI>If a man therefore purge him&s;elf from the&s;e</HI>; (that is from the&s;e hereticks &amp; fal&s;e teachers; e&s;pe|cially from their errors and corruptions that he &s;pake of in the 16<HI>th</HI> &amp; 17<HI>th</HI> ver&s;es; or any other fal&s;e doc|trines and corrupt practices that would &s;ubvert the fundamental doctrines of chri&s;tianity,) <HI>he &s;hall be a ve&s;&s;el unto honour, &s;anctified and meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and prepared unto every good work.</HI></P>
<P>Here the apo&s;tle carries on the metaphor he had begun in the foregoing ver&s;es; repre&s;enting the church of God under the &s;imilitude of a great hou&s;e, and Chri&s;t as the ma&s;ter of it; and the members, e&s;peci|ally the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, as ve&s;&s;els in it; which if they would be ve&s;&s;els unto honour, &s;anctified and fitted for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and prepared to every good work, mu&s;t be throughly purged and clean&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003867_0019_100266444AD46A48">It mu&s;t needs be a de&s;ireable thing to be ve&s;&s;els unto honour, to be imployed in the high and honour|able &s;ervices of that great hou&s;e, which is the church of the living God. And they are ve&s;&s;els unto honour indeed, who are not only &s;anctified, &s;et apart and con&s;ecrated to that holy &s;ervice, but are al&s;o fitted for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, even prepared, qualified and di&s;|po&s;ed to every good work that he &s;hall &s;et them about. But now in order to this, a man mu&s;t be purged and clean&s;ed: <HI>if a man purge him&s;elf from the&s;e he &s;hall be a ve&s;&s;el unto honour, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This may &s;uffice to introduce the &s;cheme of my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e: And as for a fuller explication of the words, it &s;hall be under the &s;everal ob&s;ervati|ons which I &s;hall be obliged to &s;peak very briefly to.</P>
<P N="1">I. Ob&s;. The church of God is as it were a great hou&s;e, of which Chri&s;t is the head and ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="2">II. Ob&s;. Mini&s;ters are as ve&s;&s;els and in&s;truments for the u&s;e and &s;ervice of this hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">III. Ob&s;. Some of the&s;e are unto honour, and &s;ome unto di&s;honour.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Ob&s;. The ve&s;&s;els unto honour, are &s;uch as be|ing &s;anctified and &s;et apart, are fitted for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, even prepared unto every good work.</P>
<P N="5">V. Ob&s;. In order to their being &s;uch ve&s;&s;els unto honour, they mu&s;t be purged &amp; freed from many things.</P>
<P N="1">I. Ob&s;. <HI>The church of God is as it were a great hou&s;e, of which Chri&s;t is the head and ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The apo&s;tle makes a compari&s;on between the church and a hou&s;e, in the foregoing ver&s;e, and carries on the metaphor in my text, &s;peaking of the ve&s;&s;els and the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e. And it is not unu&s;ual for the Holy Gho&s;t to repre&s;ent the church of Chri&s;t un|der that &s;imilitude. Sometimes the church is con&s;i|dered as a building it &s;elf. Thus (&s;ays the apo&s;tle to the church of Corinth) <HI>Ye are God's building,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.9. And particular &s;aints are called lively &s;tones, that make up the building, 1 Pet. 2 5. <HI>Ye al&s;o as lively &s;tones, are built up a &s;piritual hou&s;e.</HI> And &s;o the
<PB N="4" REF="003867_0020_1002071833F1E9A0">
happy union of chri&s;tians in the principles and prac|tice of faith and holine&s;s, love and charity, is repre|&s;ented as the &s;everal parts of a building that are fram|ed with great exactne&s;s, &s;o as to come together every piece to its proper place. Eph. 2.21. <HI>In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into an holy temple in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But then at other times the church, when it is re|pre&s;ented under the metaphor of an hou&s;e, intends not the building it &s;elf, but tho&s;e that live in, and belong to the hou&s;e; even the family or hou&s;hold. Thus we read of the hou&s;e of <HI>Cloe,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.11. of the hou&s;e of <HI>One&s;iphorus,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.16. which intend tho&s;e that belong to the hou&s;e, even the <HI>hou&s;hold.</HI> And thus the church is called the <HI>hou&s;hold</HI> of God, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.19. and the <HI>hou&s;hold</HI> of faith, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.10. So that we may indifferently con&s;ider the church of Chri&s;t either as the hou&s;e it &s;elf, or as the hou&s;hold, even tho&s;e that make up the family of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And con&s;idering the church as an hou&s;e in one &s;en&s;e or other, Chri&s;t is the owner, head and ma&s;ter of it. Heb. 3.6. <HI>But Chri&s;t as a &s;on over his own hou&s;e, who&s;e hou&s;e are we,</HI> that is we chri&s;tians, <HI>if we hold fa&s;t the confidence and the rejoycing of the hope firm unto the end.</HI> So that the church of Chri&s;t is his hou&s;e: He is the ma&s;ter, the owner and the governour of it. It be|longs to him by all imaginable right what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This &s;piritual hou&s;e, the church of God, is Chri&s;t's by gift; for it is made up of tho&s;e whom the father hath given unto him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.2.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o his by purcha&s;e; for the church of God is what he has purcha&s;ed with his own blood, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28.</P>
<P>They are his al&s;o by conque&s;t; for it is by his al|mighty power and grace that they are re&s;cued out of the hands of their &s;piritual enemies, bro't out of the kingdom of &s;atan into the kingdom of the Son of God.</P>
<P>And then la&s;tly; He is the owner &amp; ma&s;ter hereof by free compact and agreement; for every one that
<PB N="5" REF="003867_0021_100207324DFF38B0">
comes in to make a part of this &s;piritual hou&s;e, or to be one of the hou&s;hold of faith, freely &s;urrenders up him&s;elf to him, as to his prince and ruler, as well as &s;aviour. They publickly own and profe&s;s him for their lord and ma&s;ter, and promi&s;e obedience to his commands.</P>
<P>So accordingly Chri&s;t acts as the head &amp; ma&s;ter of this great hou&s;hold. He looks upon them as his particu|lar care and charge, and gives his orders, directions and commands to them, even all the laws, &s;tatutes and ordinances of the Go&s;pel. He &s;ets them their &s;ervice, and gives every one his work to do. And then as a good hou&s;holder he makes provi&s;ion for his church; not only for their bodily, but for their &s;piritual &s;up|port and comfort. He takes care that they be fed with the bread of life. They eat and drink at his table, and are cloathed with his righteou&s;ne&s;s, as well as fed by his grace, and he takes care that every one has his portion in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P N="2">II. Ob&s;. <HI>The Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel may be and are con&s;idered as ve&s;&s;els or in&s;truments in this hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay ve&s;&s;els or in&s;truments, becau&s;e the word u&s;ed in my text for ve&s;&s;els, &s;ignifies al&s;o any in&s;trument, as Criticks ob&s;erve; e&s;pecially any in&s;truments or uten|&s;ils of a family, as well as tho&s;e excavated ones that do more &s;trictly go under the name of ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are &s;et forth under various characters, and their office repre&s;ented by very diffe|rent metaphors; &s;ome importing the honour, others the labour, and others the u&s;efulne&s;s of their office. They are repre&s;ented &s;ometimes as <HI>angels,</HI> Rev. 1.20. &s;ometimes as <HI>&s;tars, Rev.</HI> 2.1. &s;ometimes as <HI>emba&s;&s;adors</HI> for Chri&s;t, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.20. &s;ometimes as <HI>me&s;&s;engers</HI> of the Lord of ho&s;ts. <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.7. &s;ometimes <HI>&s;tewards</HI> of the my&s;teries of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.1. &s;ometimes <HI>over|&s;eers</HI> of the flock or family of Chri&s;t, <HI>Act.</HI> 20.28. &s;ometimes as <HI>labourers</HI> in the harve&s;t, <HI>Matth.</HI> 9.38. &s;ometimes as <HI>watchmen,</HI> and at other times as <HI>&s;ervants:</HI> And in our text they are repre&s;ented only as <HI>ve&s;&s;els</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="003867_0022_10026647AE34C7F8">
or <HI>uten&s;ils</HI> in the hou&s;e, for the convenience and &s;er+vice of the hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>And this is not the only place where mini&s;ters are repre&s;ented under this humbling metaphor: For thus &s;ays the apo&s;tle, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.7. We have this trea&s;ure in <HI>earthen ve&s;&s;els,</HI> (that is the trea&s;ure of the go&s;pel,) that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. And the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> might well make u&s;e of this metaphor, becau&s;e the Lord him&s;elf de|clares of him in particular, that he was a <HI>cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el</HI> unto him to bear his name before the gentiles, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.15. So that mini&s;ters may be looked upon, and ought, in order to keep them&s;elves humble, to look upon them&s;elves but as ve&s;&s;els in the hou&s;e: And they may well be looked upon as &s;uch; for they are but as ve&s;&s;els or in&s;truments that the great ma&s;ter of the hou&s;hold makes u&s;e of, for the benefit of his church.</P>
<P>They are ve&s;&s;els as they are of God's forming and not of their own; and all formed and fa&s;hioned as he plea&s;es; &s;ome of larger and &s;ome of &s;maller &s;ize and capacity, ju&s;t as &s;eems good in his &s;ight, and will be&s;t an&s;wer the &s;everal u&s;es they are to be put to in his church.</P>
<P>Moreover, they are ve&s;&s;els, as whatever is con|tain'd in them is not their own, but what they re|ceive: If they are filled with knowledge and wi&s;dom, with gifts and graces, it is not from them&s;elves any more than any empty ve&s;&s;el can fill it&s;elf. A ve&s;&s;el is capable of receiving, and that is all that can be &s;aid of us; for what have we that we did not re|ceive? 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 4.7. All mini&s;terial accompli&s;hments are given to mini&s;ters: <HI>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights,</HI> Jam 1 17.</P>
<P>Again, they are ve&s;&s;els as they not only are made to receive and contain, but al&s;o to pour out again, to convey and di&s;pen&s;e to others. This is the u&s;e of ve&s;&s;els, not only to receive and contain, but to pour out again as there is occa&s;ion. Thus mini|&s;ters
<PB N="7" REF="003867_0023_100266492FE5B030">
have the trea&s;ures of the go&s;pel committed to them, and are filled with gifts and graces, that they might convey &amp; di&s;pen&s;e the &s;ame to others. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is to deliver as well as receive. <HI>I delivered unto you that which I received of the Lord,</HI> &s;ays the a|po&s;tle, 1 Cor 11.23. <HI>Paul</HI> was a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el to bear Chri&s;t's name, and to convey his go&s;pel, and the way to &s;alvation by him to the Gentiles. And this is the bu&s;ine&s;s of every cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el, to convey the knowledge of Chri&s;t, to di&s;pen&s;e his go&s;pel, and his ordinances unto the people, according as they have received them; every one according to his capacity, and the mea&s;ure he has received.</P>
<P>Furthermore, mini&s;ters are ve&s;&s;els as they are of no u&s;e, nor are they imployed any farther than Chri&s;t, the great hou&s;holder, &s;ees cau&s;e to make u&s;e of them. The ve&s;&s;els or in&s;truments of a hou&s;e can make no u&s;e of them&s;elves, nor are they of u&s;e any further than the ma&s;ter of the family &s;ees cau&s;e to occupy and improve them: &s;o mini&s;ters are &s;erviceable in the church no fur|ther than Chri&s;t &s;ees cau&s;e to improve them in his &s;er|vice; and &s;ome he makes more u&s;e of, than others; and the more &s;ervice he puts them to, the more honour he confers upon them.</P>
<P>Again, they are ve&s;&s;els as they are only the means and in&s;truments of any real &s;aving benefit flowing to the church by them. They are not the efficient cau|&s;es, but only the in&s;truments of the conver&s;ion of &s;in|ners. They can't beget faith in any, nor be&s;tow &s;av|ing grace upon them, but are only in&s;truments in God's hands, by which God works &s;uch a gracious change in them. <HI>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but mi|ni&s;ters by whom ye believed?</HI> 1 Cor. 3.5</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Mini&s;ters are ve&s;&s;els as they like other ve&s;&s;els are liable to be broken, or in time to decay &amp; wear away. No ve&s;&s;el, let it be made of gold or &s;ilver, of bra&s;s or iron, and much more of wood or &s;tone, but what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> cu&s;ualty or other is broken to piece, or by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;age in time wears out, &s;o as to be fit for no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

&s;ervice. And this is the ca&s;e with the choice&s;t ve&s;&s;els that God has among his mini&s;ters: if they are &s;uffered to continue, yet according to the common cour&s;e of nature, in a few years they wear out, di&s;&s;olve to du&s;t, and are laid a&s;ide in the place of &s;ilence and inactivity. But how much more common is it for them by &s;ome violent di&s;temper, or &s;ome &s;udden &s;troke of the divine hand, to be da&s;hed in pieces like a potter's ve&s;&s;el before that time?</P>
<P N="3">III. Ob&s;. <HI>Among the mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel &s;ome are ve&s;&s;els unto honour, and &s;ome unto di&s;honour.</HI></P>
<P>As in a great hou&s;e there are not only ve&s;&s;els of gold and of &s;ilver, but al&s;o of wood and of earth, and &s;ome to honour and &s;ome to di&s;honour, &s;o it is in the church of Chri&s;t, with re&s;pect unto the mini&s;ters of it.</P>
<P>Here let me &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some are ve&s;&s;els unto honour.</HI></P>
<P>Some there are that for the exqui&s;ite frame &amp; con|&s;titution of their natures, the brightne&s;s of their natu|ral parts, their improvements by education, and above all for their refinements by divine grace, may well be compared to ve&s;&s;els of gold and of &s;ilver, exceeding precious and valuable, as well as u&s;eful &amp; &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>And the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, the&s;e mini&s;ters are unto honour,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Unto the honour of Chri&s;t the ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver in a hou&s;e are to the ho|nour of the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, as they &s;et forth his rich e&s;tate: &s;o the&s;e ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver in the church of Chri&s;t are unto His honour, as they &s;erve to &s;et forth the riches and the glory of Chri&s;t. Such mini&s;ters by their doctrines and by their lives do much to di&s;play the honour of Chri&s;t: They &s;et forth the glory of his per&s;on, the glory of his offices as our re|deemer, the glory of his wi&s;dom, of his power, and e&s;pecially of his grace in the redemption of &s;inners. Hence the apo&s;tle &s;ays of &s;uch golden ve&s;&s;els, 2 Cor. 8.23. They are the <HI>glory of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>They are unto the honour of the holy religion they receive, and di&s;pen&s;e to others.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003867_0025_1002664AC3C87D98">A &s;ilver or a golden ve&s;&s;el &s;erves to recommend the liquor or whatever is contained therein, e&s;pecially if otherwi&s;e it be good in its nature and kind. And nothing tends more to do a proper bottom to religion, and recommend it to the e&s;teem, the choice, the love and practice of a People, than its being brought to them in &s;uch golden ve&s;&s;els, that is, able mini&s;ters of the new te&s;tament, who are not only able by acceptable words to &s;et forth the excellency of it, but al&s;o recommend it by their own example. Such mini&s;ters by their &s;hining gifts and graces reflect a very plea|&s;ing lu&s;tre upon religion, and adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They are ve&s;&s;els unto honour, as they are &s;uch on whom God will confer &s;pecial marks of honour.</HI></P>
<P>Ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver are unto honour, as the ma&s;ter and owner of them puts honour upon them, by taking particular care of them that they be not lo&s;t or abu&s;ed, and by providing more honourable &s;helves and clo&s;ets for them in the hou&s;e. Thus God &s;ets a great value upon tho&s;e mini&s;ters that are as ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver; he has a higher e&s;teem of them, and &s;ets his love more upon them, and delights to ho|nour them. <HI>Them that honour me I will honour,</HI> &s;ays God, 1 Sam. 2.30. He will put marks of honour upon them whil&s;t they live, and afterwards he will crown them with glory and honour. Now he will cau&s;e them to &s;hine like bright ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver, but then he will cau&s;e them to &s;hine as the bright|ne&s;s of the firmament, and as the &s;tars for ever &amp; ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Among the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, &s;ome are ve&s;&s;els unto di&s;honour.</HI></P>
<P>In this great hou&s;e of the church there are ve&s;&s;els of wood and of earth; men of a cour&s;e and a heavy mold, of inferior powers and &s;mall abilities, dull life|le&s;s &s;ouls, without any vigour or activity, uncultiva|ted and unrefined, gro&s;s &amp; ignorant in their thoughts and apprehen&s;ion of things, fit only for the mean and ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of life, and no way &s;uitable for the
<PB N="10" REF="003867_0026_1002664E32BF5540">
high and honourable &s;ervices of the &s;anctuary.</P>
<P>But by ve&s;&s;els of earth and of wood we may under|&s;tand men of earthly &s;ouls, men who&s;e &s;ouls cleave unto the du&s;t, and that mind earthly things, that are carnal, earthly and &s;en&s;ual, having their affections ingro&s;&s;ed by the world, and the things of &s;en&s;e, filled with &s;ome filthy lu&s;t or other, which hinders them from receiving, much more from conveying any thing that is of a &s;ublime &amp; &s;piritual nature, and &s;o utterly un|fit for, and indi&s;po&s;ed to the holy and &s;piritual &s;ervi|ces of the sanctuary.</P>
<P>And now the&s;e are ve&s;&s;els unto di&s;honour; the&s;e are a di&s;honour to Chri&s;t, a di&s;honour to the faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, a di&s;credit to the church and to them&s;elves: or if they &s;hould pa&s;s without any re|markable di&s;grace here, yet depend upon it, they will be covered with &s;hame &amp; everla&s;ting contempt here|after.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Ob&s;. <HI>Ve&s;&s;els unto honour are &s;uch as being sancti|fied and &s;et apart, are fited for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, even pre|pared unto every good work.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the character or account that the apo&s;tle gives of a good faithful mini&s;ter, a ve&s;&s;el unto honour; that he is &s;anctified, &s;eparated and &s;et apart to that &s;ervice; and not only &s;o, but fit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and that is to be prepared unto every good work. So that a mini&s;ter who is a ve&s;&s;el unto honour is,</P>
<P N="1">1. One that is &s;anctified, con&s;ecrated and &s;et apart to that office.</P>
<P N="2">2. He is al&s;o one that is fit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e.</P>
<P>And this</P>
<P N="3">3. Is to be prepared unto every good work.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A mini&s;ter that is a ve&s;&s;el unto honour is one that is &s;anctified, con&s;ecrated or &s;et apart for that holy office.</HI></P>
<P>A ve&s;&s;el unto honour <HI>&s;anctified.</HI>&mdash; A ve&s;&s;el that is unto honour mu&s;t be &s;anctified. This doubtle&s;s has reference to the ve&s;&s;els of the altar and tabernacle, that were all to be &s;anctified before they were made u&s;e of for the &s;ervice of the &s;anctuary, <HI>Exod.</HI> 30.29, 44.
<PB N="11" REF="003867_0027_10026650AAF72928">
were &s;anctified as they were &s;et apart purely for that u&s;e, &s;eparate from all common &amp; ordinary u&s;es.</P>
<P>So the Prie&s;ts and Levites of old were &s;et apart and &s;anctified to the holy &s;ervices of the altar and taber|nacle. And a great deal of ceremony and &s;olemnity was u&s;ed in the con&s;ecrating the prie&s;ts, and &s;epara|ting them to their holy office. And altho' the&s;e bur|den&s;ome ceremonies of con&s;ecration under the law are aboli&s;hed; yet even now mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are to be &s;anctified, and &s;et apart to their holy office, and in &s;olemn manner introduced into that &s;acred function. They are to be <HI>&s;eparated</HI> unto the Go&s;pel of God, as the apo&s;tle &s;ays he was, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.1. which was agrea|ble to the direction of the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>Act.</HI> 13.2. <HI>Separate</HI> me Barnabas and Saul for the work where|unto I have called them.</P>
<P>And now the manner they took for the &s;eparation of them was fa&s;ting, &amp; prayer, and laying their hands on them, as in the following ver&s;e. Accordingly this became an apo&s;tolical practice to &s;anctify or &s;e|parate to the mini&s;terial office, by fa&s;ting &amp; prayer, and laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, accom|panied with a &s;olemn charge in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, that they take heed to their mini&s;try, that they fulfil it. So that the &s;olemn ordination of mini&s;ters is their &s;anctification or con&s;ecration or &s;eparation to the &s;acred office of the mini&s;try: It is the regular intro|duction and &s;olemn inve&s;titure of them in their office. So that every one that is thus &s;olemnly ordained may be &s;aid to be a ve&s;&s;el &s;anctified or con&s;ecrated.</P>
<P>But then this external &s;anctification &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome|thing that is internal and real. It &s;ignifies that God approves of them; that he &s;ets them apart, and owns them for his mini&s;ters. And then that they &s;eparate them&s;elves to that office, and devote and give up them&s;elves to that &s;ervice; that they &s;eparate them|&s;elves from the other bu&s;ine&s;s of life, and give them|&s;elves wholly to the&s;e things.</P>
<P>And now one whom the Lord approves, and does
<PB N="12" REF="003867_0028_1002072316097EA8">
thus &s;incerely give him&s;elf up to the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, and is &s;olemnly &s;eparated by fa&s;ting and prayer, and the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, he is a ve&s;&s;el &s;anctified to all intents and purpo&s;es under the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="2">2 But if he would be a ve&s;&s;el unto honour, he mu&s;t not only be &s;anctified; <HI>but fit or meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>It is not &s;ufficient to be &s;anctified and &s;eparated, unle&s;s we are fit for the u&s;e and &s;ervice we are &s;e|parated unto. What will it &s;ignify to be ordained and inducted into that holy office of the mini&s;try, and yet not fit for the u&s;e; not capable of an&s;wering the ends and de&s;igns of it? Therefore if &s;uch would be ve&s;&s;els to honour, they mu&s;t be meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e. The ve&s;&s;els of the &s;anctuary that were con&s;e|crated, were made fit for their &s;everal u&s;es de&s;igned for them; &s;o mu&s;t mini&s;ters be fit for the u&s;e which Chri&s;t the ma&s;ter has for us, if we would be ve&s;&s;els unto honour. The word tran&s;lated <HI>fit</HI> is in <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 4.11. Phil. 11.</NOTE> other places profitable; it &s;ignifies very profitable; it &s;ig|nifies that they mu&s;t be very profitable for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, that would be ve&s;&s;els of honour. They mu&s;t be in all re&s;pects fit for the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t. They mu&s;t have that knowledge, that wi&s;dom, and that grace that is nece&s;&s;ary to make them fit for Chri&s;t to imploy, and to render them capable of performing the &s;ervice he calls them unto. The ma&s;ter's u&s;e of mini&s;ters, or the bu&s;ine&s;s that he has occa&s;ion to u&s;e or imploy them in, is to bear his name, to make him known to the people, and the way to &s;alvation by him, as it is laid down in the go&s;pel. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;hew men the way to Salvation; to turn men from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan unto God. And now mini&s;ters mu&s;t be fit for this u&s;e and bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003867_0029_100266522DD11488">They mu&s;t have that knowledge of God &amp; Chri&s;t, and &s;uch an acquaintance with the holy Scriptures, and with the doctrines and duties contained therein, as will make them able mini&s;ters of the new Te&s;ta|ment. And mu&s;t have that principle of love and obedience reigning in their &s;ouls, as will prompt and put them upon the faithful di&s;charge of the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in them, and of an&s;wering all the good ends and purpo&s;es of their office. Without this it is im|po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be fit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e. For how can a man an&s;wer the end of enlightening and in&s;tructing others that is ignorant and in the dark him&s;elf? And what is there that will put a man up|on the faithful di&s;charge of the mini&s;terial office, but a principle of love and obedience to Chri&s;t? But with &s;uch a principle, the man will be fit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e; for &s;uch a principle reigning in the &s;oul, will carry the man forth to every kind of &s;ervice that the ma&s;ter &s;hall call him to. And this leads me to &s;ay</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That they are even prepared unto every good work.</HI></P>
<P>This explains the former head; for to be fit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, is to be prepared to every good work. For what is the u&s;e the ma&s;ter has for his mini&s;ters? Why, it is for every good work; &s;ometimes one good work, and &s;ometimes another: And he that is not prepared unto every good work, is not entirely fitted for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e.</P>
<P>Sometimes the ma&s;ter has occa&s;ion to u&s;e us, in &s;uch a work, and &s;ometimes another; and therefore the mini&s;ter mu&s;t be prepared for every good work. But now what a va&s;t variety of work is there in the mini&s;terial office, that the ma&s;ter does con&s;tantly, or may occa&s;ionally call us unto? There is the daily work and bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tudy; giving our atten|dance to reading, meditation and prayer, and com|po&s;ing di&s;cour&s;es for the publick in&s;truction of the flock. And then there are the mini&s;trations of God's hou&s;e, &s;uch as being the mouth of the people in offer|ing their prayers and prai&s;es to God, and bringing the
<PB N="14" REF="003867_0030_10026654AA942580">
oracles of God opened and applyed to them: The admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, and the con&s;ures of the church; vi&s;iting the &s;ick; hearing the difficul|ties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es that one and another may be la|bouring under; clearing up their doubts, removing their ignorance, leading them out of their errors, &s;cattering their fears, taking away their &s;cruples, and leading them in the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides the&s;e ordinary and common &s;ervices of the mini&s;ter, there are other &s;ervices of a more difficult nature, that he may be called unto. Some|times there are dreadful divi&s;ions and contentions to be healed. Sometimes there are gro&s;s and danger|ous errors to be refuted, and the truths of the go&s;pel to be &s;upported and defended. Sometimes gro&s;s di&s;|orders to be reformed, &amp; growing wickedne&s;s couragi|ou&s;ly and &s;tedfa&s;tly to be oppo&s;ed. And to men|tion no more, &s;ometimes they may be called, not only to bear te&s;timony to the truth; but to &s;eal it with their blood. The&s;e are &s;ome of the u&s;es, that the ma&s;ter may have occa&s;ion to put the&s;e ve&s;&s;els of the &s;anctuary unto: And if they would be ve&s;&s;els unto honour, and fit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, they mu&s;t be prepared for the&s;e, and every other good work.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. But now, <HI>What is it to be prepared unto every good work?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Their being qualified and capacitated for it.</P>
<P>And then</P>
<P N="2">2. Their being con&s;tantly inclined and di&s;po&s;ed to any and every good work, the ma&s;ter &s;hall at any time &s;et them about.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To be prepared for every good work, &s;uppo&s;es our be|ing qualified and accompli&s;hed for it.</HI></P>

It &s;uppo&s;es &s;uch an one, in his very make, to have good natural powers and capa|cities, and that the&s;e be inlarged, and improved and refined by education and &s;tudy. To be <HI>prepared for every good work,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es a man of &s;uperior accom|pli&s;hments, a quick apprehen&s;ion, &s;olid judgment, and an inlarged thought, able to comprehend a great deal of knowledge, to &s;ee far &amp; wide, and reach deep into things. It &s;uppo&s;es him al&s;o &s;tored with a great deal of knowledge of various kinds, but e&s;pecially that he be mighty in the &s;criptures: that he under&s;tands the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and the arguments to &s;upport them: that he be aware of the errors crept into the church, and able to detect the fal&s;e foundations up|on which they are built: that he be well acquainted with the duties of the chri&s;tian life, with the rea&s;ons and motives to inforce them: that he be apt to teach, able to convey his tho'ts and ideas of things to others, in a way that &s;hall both enlighten their minds and affect their hearts: in a word, he mu&s;t be a ready &s;cribe, well in&s;tructed in affairs relating to the king|dom of heaven, and furni&s;hed for every kind of &s;er|vice, that the mini&s;terial office is concerned with.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>But then this being prepared for every good work, intends that there be a con&s;tant readine&s;s &amp; willingne&s;s to every &s;ervice the ma&s;ter may call us unto.</HI></P>
<P>He that is prepared to every good work is not idle and &s;lothful, he is not backward to any &s;ervice that his ma&s;ter calls him unto. He will be diligent in his ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s, and will go on with chearfulne&s;s. He won't engage in the bu&s;ine&s;s he is called to by con&s;traint, but willingly, and of a ready mind. He won't excu&s;e him&s;elf from labour &amp; &s;ervice thro' &s;loth and indolence, or becau&s;e of the difficulty of the &s;ervice; neither will he &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;o en|cumbred with other bu&s;ine&s;s, as not to be able to at|tend the work that Chri&s;t has for him to do. He will look upon him&s;elf devoted to the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t,
<PB N="16" REF="003867_0032_100207298EB5EA38">
and will lay a&s;ide every thing that &s;hall clog &amp; hinder him in any part of the mini&s;terial calling.&mdash;In a word here, for I may not enlarge; He loves his ma&s;ter, and loves his work, and e&s;teems his wages infinitely beyond the utmo&s;t &s;ervice he can po&s;&s;ibly do, nay and that the very &s;ervice carries a reward with it; and therefore from a principle of love and gratitude, as well as that of obedience, he readily engages in every &s;ervice he is &s;et about; and rejoyces that he is counted worthy to be imployed in any &s;ervice for the honour of Chri&s;t: And therefore he &s;ticks at no work that Chri&s;t calls him to, let it be never &s;o difficult; but if his ma&s;ter enquires, <HI>Whom &s;hall I &s;end, and who will go for us?</HI> he will (like the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> when his lips were touched with a coal from the altar) an&s;wer, <HI>Here am I, &s;end me,</HI> I&s;ai. 6.8.</P>
<P N="5">V. Ob&s;. <HI>There are certain things that mini&s;ters mu&s;t be purged and clean&s;ed from, in order to their being ve&s;&s;els unto honour, fitted for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a man therefore purge him&s;elf from the&s;e, he &s;hall be a ve&s;&s;el unto honour,</HI> &amp;c. implying that there are &s;ome things cleaving naturally to them, or which they are incident unto, that mu&s;t be taken away in order to their being ve&s;&s;els unto honour. An unclean filthy ve&s;|&s;el can't be a ve&s;&s;el unto honour, till it be purify'd and clean&s;ed; and we are all &s;uch in our natural &s;tate: <HI>for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</HI> In our &s;tate of nature we are defiled with &s;in, and are altogether an unclean thing; and therefore mu&s;t be clean&s;ed in order to become ve&s;&s;els of honour. The ve&s;&s;els of the &s;anctuary were to be clean, &s;o were they that were to bear them, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 52.11. And or|der was expre&s;ly given concerning the Levites, that were to attend the &s;ervice of the tabernacle, that they &s;hould be taken from among the children of I&s;rael and clean&s;ed, <HI>Numb.</HI> 8.6. And there is the &s;ame rea&s;on that all who mini&s;ter in holy things, and before a holy God, &s;hould be purged &amp; clean&s;ed from all their filthine&s;s.</P>
<P>The prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, and of

the danger of entering upon holy &s;ervices, without be|ing purged and clean&s;ed, that he cries out, <HI>Wo is me for I am undone, becau&s;e I am a man of unclean lips</HI>; and immediately there flies a Seraph with a live coal from off the altar to touch his lips, and &s;o his iniquity was taken away, and his &s;in purged. And &s;urely every one that would be meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, mu&s;t have a live coal to touch him; he mu&s;t have the influences of the Holy Gho&s;t to purge &amp; clean&s;e him. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 6 5, 6.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>But what are the things that &s;uch mu&s;t be purged from, that they might be ve&s;&s;els unto honour</HI> &amp;c?</P>
<P>An&s;. In general, <HI>from errors in doctrines, and cor|ruptions in heart and life.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They mu&s;t be purged from errors, and fal&s;e notions in religion.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are particularly referred to in my text; <HI>if a man therefore purge him&s;elf from the&s;e,</HI> that is from the per&s;ons, or rather the errors of tho&s;e fal&s;e teachers, <HI>Hymeneus &amp; Philetus,</HI> who had imbibed, and were &s;et|ting forth a mo&s;t dangerous doctrine, that began to &s;pread like a gangrene, and had overthrown the faith of &s;ome. And now as mini&s;ters were to be purged from that gro&s;s error, &s;o the rea&s;on will hold the &s;ame for their being purged from all other dangerous and de&s;tructive errors, as well as that particular one, in order to their being fitted for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e. Chri&s;t was full of truth, as well as grace, yea he was truth it &s;elf, and he came to teach and preach and <HI>bear wit|ne&s;s to the truth:</HI> And it is highly nece&s;&s;ary, that every ve&s;&s;el fit for his u&s;e, mu&s;t receive the truth as it is in Je&s;us. How can that ve&s;&s;el be fit for Chri&s;t's u&s;e (which is to convey the truth) that is already full of error, in matters of religion, both as to the doct|rines and duties of it? How can that man be fit to teach the truth to others, that is him&s;elf given up to &s;trong delu&s;ions, and made to believe lies? How can that man be fit to teach others the way to &s;alvation, that is mi&s;taken in the way him&s;elf? I would not be under&s;tood here as if a man's having &s;ome mi&s;taken
<PB N="18" REF="003867_0034_1002665B345435B0">
notions in &s;ome particular points of religion utterly un|fits for the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t; if &s;o, I know not who would be fit for his u&s;e. For, I may venture to &s;ay, that there is not a man upon earth, but what labours under &s;ome mi&s;takes or other; and many who have by education or prejudice imbib'd fal&s;e notions in &s;ome le&s;&s;er points, have been ve&s;&s;els unto honour. But what I refer to more e&s;pecially, are fundamental er|rors: errors in the e&s;&s;ential parts of religion, and that are incon&s;i&s;tent with a principle of &s;aving grace with|in. And as to the&s;e, I &s;hall not pretend to enumerate them; not that I think them &s;o many, as the gene|rality of people imagine.</P>
<P>But the&s;e, men mu&s;t be purged from, that would engage in the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t; for they di&s;qualify per&s;ons for that &s;acred office. So that it highly con|cerns every man, de&s;igning for, and engaging in this &s;ervice, to take all po&s;&s;ible care that he be found in the faith, and that his principles be well e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed by the oracles of God. And he mu&s;t earne&s;tly pray that the Spirit of truth would lead him into all truth, and keep him from all errors. And if we &s;et our &s;elves to a diligent and impartial &s;earch after truth in the holy &s;criptures, we may hope to be &s;aved from any mi&s;take that will be hurtful unto our &s;elves, or that will unfit us for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We mu&s;t be purged from our lu&s;ts and corruptions, if we would be ve&s;&s;els unto honour.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing does &s;o univer&s;ally and effectually di&s;qua|lify for the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t, as the prevailing of our lu&s;ts and corruptions. Accordingly this is the di|rection to <HI>Timothy</HI> immediately after my text, that <HI>he free all youthful lu&s;ts</HI>; intimating hereby that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to his being a ve&s;&s;el unto honour, fit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e. And &s;o it is, for every one that would be a good mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he mu&s;t flee all manner of lu&s;ts, and get them all &s;ubdued and mortified. One lu&s;t reigning in the &s;oul, and breaking forth in the life, pollutes &amp; di&s;honours the ve&s;&s;el, and
<PB N="19" REF="003867_0035_10020730B26CDFE0">
makes us unmeet for the holy &s;ervice of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Here therefore let me &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Such mu&s;t be purged from all fle&s;hy lu&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>For as the&s;e war again&s;t the &s;oul, &s;o they war a|gain&s;t Chri&s;t; and how unmeet then, mu&s;t they ren|der the man for his u&s;e? The man that is under the government of fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, is in a &s;tate of enmity and rebellion again&s;t Chri&s;t, and all that is holy. And how is &s;uch an one prepared unto every good work, when he is inclined to evil, and only evil? How can any be ve&s;&s;els unto honour, unle&s;s they know how (as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 The&s;. 4.8.) <HI>to po&s;|&s;e&s;s their ve&s;&s;els in &s;anctification and honour?</HI> Surely if any would be ve&s;&s;els unto honour, they mu&s;t cru|cify the fle&s;h with the affections and lu&s;ts, and mor|tify their members upon the earth; fornication and all uncleanne&s;s, let it not be named among them.</P>
<P>In a word, mini&s;ters mu&s;t be &s;ober and temperate in all things, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their irregular appetites, and keeping their bodies under. The apo&s;tle was &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of this, that he looked upon him&s;elf in hazard not only of lo&s;ing the &s;ucce&s;s of his mini&s;try, but of lo&s;ing him&s;elf for ever; and his words ought &s;eriou&s;ly to be con&s;idered, 1 Cor. 9.27. <HI>I keep under my body and bring it into &s;ubjection, le&s;t that by any means when I have preached to others, I my &s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such mu&s;t be purged from worldly lu&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>That is, they mu&s;t get rid of an inordinate love to the world, and the things that are in the world. For where there is &s;uch a love prevailing, there can't be that love to Chri&s;t, that is nece&s;&s;ary for his u&s;e and &s;ervice. For as our Saviour plainly tells us, Matt. 6.24. <HI>No man can &s;erve two ma&s;ters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or el&s;e he will hold to the one, and de&s;pi&s;e the other. Ye cannot &s;erve God and mammon.</HI> Whil&s;t men's hearts are full of the world, how can they be full of Chri&s;t? Our love to Chri&s;t is nece&s;&s;ary to our feeding his flock, and there|fore
<PB N="20" REF="003867_0036_1002665DD59E1A78">
does he demand &s;o often of <HI>Peter, Love&s;t thou me? Love&s;t thou me more than the&s;e?</HI> For as he &s;ays Mat. 10 37. <HI>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: He that loveth &s;on or daugh|ter more than me, is not worthy of me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Spiritual lu&s;ts mu&s;t be purged away, in order to men's being ve&s;&s;els unto honour.</HI></P>
<P>Such as unbelief, pride, envy, malice, and the like, which are &s;o contrary to Chri&s;t, and to the de&s;ign of his go&s;pel kingdom, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch, who have the&s;e lu&s;ts reigning in them, to be any way ve&s;&s;els of honour, meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e.</P>
<P>What can be more improper, than for one that has an evil heart of unbelief (whereby he departs from the living God continually) to be imployed in con|veying the doctrines of the go&s;pel to others, and be an in&s;trument to per&s;wade them to believe, what he does not believe him&s;elf?</P>
<P>What is more ab&s;urd than for one that has the lu&s;t of pride reigning in him, to be imployed in bringing a meek and lowly Je&s;us to the world, and recom|mending the imitation of him? What more incon|gruous, than for one that is full of hatred, malice and envy, to be imployed in repre&s;enting Chri&s;t, and &s;etting forth his infinite love &amp; good will to the world?</P>
<P>I don't &s;ay but that God may &s;uffer &s;uch in&s;tru|ments to be imployed, and knows how to get glory to him&s;elf by them, and &s;o to an&s;wer his own purpo&s;es: But according to the natural tendency of things, &s;uch men are the mo&s;t likely in&s;truments the devil can have to oppo&s;e the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, and cau&s;e a revolt over to his own kingdom. And it is mo&s;t cer|tain that &s;uch mini&s;ters as have been under the pow|er of their lu&s;ts, have done the mo&s;t of any men in the world to di&s;honour Chri&s;t, and hurt his intere&s;t in the world, and to overthrow the faith of chri&s;tians. Which &s;hows that mini&s;ters mu&s;t be purged from the&s;e, if they would in any mea&s;ure be fit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e and &s;ervice.</P>

<P>He is not only head of that great family the church, but head over all things unto the church; &s;o that he has the &s;ole ab&s;olute government of all things in, or any way relating to his church &amp; kingdom.

He pre&s;cribes rules &amp; orders for his hou&s;e, which are carefully to be regarded by all the hou&s;hold; and the&s;e he has given us in his word, which we mu&s;t carefully ob&s;erve, and not pre&s;ume to &s;et up any of our own that are not a|greable herewith. This ma&s;ter as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was faithful in his hou&s;e, &amp; has given rules &s;ufficient for his church.

<P>Whatever high and honourable u&s;es they are put to, they mu&s;t remember they are only as ve&s;&s;els and in&s;truments, not as efficient cau&s;es.</P>

<P>In this great hou&s;e there are ve&s;&s;els of wood &amp; of earth, as well as of gold &amp; of &s;ilver; &s;ome unto di&s;ho|nour, as well as &s;ome unto honour. And now every mini&s;ter is one or other of the&s;e; mini&s;ters therefore &s;hould be jealous of them&s;elves, whether they don't by their &s;loth and negligence, by their carnal &amp; earthly affections, give rea&s;on to fear that they are but ve&s;&s;els of wood and of earth. And are there not &s;o many lu&s;ts and corruptions working in them, as may make them fear whether they are not ve&s;&s;els unto di&s;honour, and unfit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e? And when we &s;ee how unprepared, how unqualified, how backward, how in|di&s;po&s;ed to many a good work, we are, we may well be &s;u&s;picious of our &s;elves. But oh, with what fear and trembling &s;hould this fill our &s;ouls! For &s;uch as are ve&s;&s;els unto di&s;honour, what are they but ve&s;&s;els of wrath? And &s;uch as are unmeet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, are fitted for de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="4">4. Inf. <HI>Here is a rule to judge whether we are ve&s;&s;els unto honour or no,</HI> viz. <HI>our being fit for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and prepared unto every good work</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Inf. <HI>How great a ble&s;&s;ing are colleges and &s;chools of learning, that may &s;erve to fit men for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and prepare them for the mini&s;terial work.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the means that God makes u&s;e of to fit them for his &s;ervice. Here it is, that of ve&s;&s;els of wood and &s;tone, he &s;o refines them, that he makes them ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver. Here it is that he in|larges the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, &amp; then fills them with knowledge, by which he fits them for &s;ervice. Such nur&s;eries then are to be e&s;teemed the great ble&s;&s;ings of our land, and what ought always to be cheri&s;hed &amp; encouraged by us.</P>
<P N="6">6. Inf. <HI>We learn what is to be looked at, in choo&s;ing and &s;eparating any to the work of the mini&s;try, viz. their being fitted for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="003867_0039_100207522A5EAE00">This is what a people are to look at in the choice of a mini&s;ter; and what mini&s;ters are to look at in &s;eparating or &s;etting apart any to that &s;acred office. It is the ma&s;ter that is to u&s;e and improve them. And unle&s;s they are fit for his u&s;e, to what purpo&s;e are they cho&s;en and ordained to that &s;ervice. The rule given to <HI>Timothy</HI> was, that <HI>he &s;hould commit this work to faithful men, who &s;hould be able to teach others al&s;o,</HI> 2 v. of the context. And therefore it would be an hor|rible betraying of our tru&s;t, to commit this work to unskilful and unfaithful men. Accordingly that mu&s;t needs be a very good rule of prudence, which the &s;ame apo&s;tle gives, 1 Tim. 5.22. <HI>Lay hands &s;uddenly on no man</HI>; that is, not till we have &s;ome good grounds to think that they are free from gro&s;s errors and corruptions; that they are like to an&s;wer the good ends of their mini&s;try, &amp; prove ve&s;&s;els unto honour.</P>

A man entering upon &s;uch a &s;acred &s;ervice as this, mu&s;t examine him&s;elf as to his qualifications and accom|pli&s;hments for it.

<P>The go&s;pel mini&s;try has it's dangers and it's difficul|ties in every place, but the place a&s;&s;igned you in the hou&s;e of God has it's peculiar difficulties: and it re|quires a ve&s;&s;el peculiarly formed, to be fitted for this part of the ma&s;ter's u&s;e.

Remember to pour out your prayers to God for them, as you pour out or di&s;pen&s;e the grace of God to them. And thus endeavour to be full going and coming. And by being thus con|tinually imployed in carrying what Chri&s;t the ma&s;ter has to &s;end to the people, and bringing back reque&s;ts with thank&s;givings upon their account, you will be found a ve&s;&s;el unto prai&s;e and honour and glory.</P>
<P>For altho' the u&s;e that the ma&s;ter puts you to in his hou&s;e, may appear mean and contemptible to the men of the world, who have their hearts &s;et upon the gaiety and granduer of it, and can think of no|thing but ea&s;e and plea&s;ure; and altho' but few of tho&s;e who are con&s;ecrated ve&s;&s;els in the hou&s;e of the Lord, will &s;ubmit unto it; yet it is a mo&s;t glorious &s;ervice in the eyes of Chri&s;t the ma&s;ter, &amp; of all the

angels in heaven, that are beholding your &s;olemn con&s;ecration: for tho&s;e mini&s;tring &s;pirits think it their honour to be &s;ent, and do with plea&s;ure go forth to mini&s;ter unto them who &s;hall be the heirs of &s;alvation. And oh what an honour, what a plea|&s;ure mu&s;t it needs be to every one that has a love to Chri&s;t and a compa&s;&s;ion for &s;ouls, to turn men from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan unto God; to convert them from the error of their ways, and to &s;ave their &s;ouls from death!</P>
<P>Wherefore, to carry on the metaphor, don't be a&s;hamed of the outward meanne&s;s of the apartment the ma&s;ter has a&s;&s;igned you in his hou&s;e; and don't be di&s;couraged at the difficulties you may have the pro&s;pect of; but let tho&s;e gracious words of Chri&s;t, LO I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS, be a comfort to you: and the tokens you have had already of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence with you, in the &s;ucce&s;s of your labours hitherto, may well encourage your further dependance upon him. Go forth therefore in the name &amp; &s;trength of the Lord Je&s;us, &amp; we tru&s;t that he will never leave nor for&s;ake you, and that his grace &s;hall be &s;ufficient for you. And let me a&s;&s;ure you, that if you be wi&s;e and faithful in this work, you &s;hall &s;hine as the &s;un in the kingdom of your father; and when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, you &s;hall receive an unfading crown of glory.</P>
<P>And now I would turn my &s;elf to the <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc</HI> Indians, who are at this time to have a mini&s;ter &s;ent unto them.</P>
<P>Behold the man, the me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of ho&s;ts, that is coming unto you. This is a ve&s;&s;el God has made choice of, to bring Chri&s;t, and in him the glad tydings of &s;alvation to you. This is the man that is to &s;hew you the way to &s;alvation; to direct you how you may e&s;cape the damnation of hell; and how you may obtain the mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto eternal life. See then that you love him, and that you &s;teem him very highly in love for his works &s;ake;
<PB N="27" REF="003867_0043_10020745EC528308">
and that you come to him to be in&s;tructed by him: that you hearken to his coun&s;els, and ob&s;erve his di|rections, and follow his example wherein he follows Chri&s;t. And this is the way for you to be happy here, and for ever hereafter; for godline&s;s hath the promi&s;e of the life that now is, &amp; of that which is to come.</P>
<P>To conclude, How earne&s;tly &s;hould we all pray, that there might be numbers of cho&s;en ve&s;&s;els, per&s;ons fitted and di&s;po&s;ed to carry the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to the heathen nations that are about us: to convey to them the knowledge of God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom to know is life eternal. How &s;hould we pity them when we &s;ee them peri&s;hing for lack of vi&s;ion? And how &s;hould we be doing our utmo&s;t to encourage per|&s;ons to go forth and carry the go&s;pel to them? And how highly proper would it be for the Government to take effectual care to &s;upport and encourage &s;uch as God may rai&s;e up from time to time, to go forth into &s;uch difficult &s;ervice? And &s;ince many of our nation at home have expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a tender concern for the propagating the go&s;pel among the Indian natives of this Land, at &s;o great a di&s;tance from them, by their charitable and pious donations for that purpo&s;e, it mu&s;t needs be highly rea&s;onable that we who live among them, and po&s;&s;e&s;s their country, &s;hould readily expend of our e&s;tates, for that which will be of the greate&s;t ad|vantage to them. This is a way of honouring the Lord with our &s;ub&s;tance, which doubtle&s;s God expects from us.</P>
<P>But to have done, Let us be careful to recommend chri&s;tianity to them, by our own &s;incere practice of it. Let us make it manife&s;t to them, in all our trea|ties, and in all our commerce, and conver&s;ation with them, that we are under the influences of the Spirit of Chri&s;t. In a word, let us adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things, &amp; cau&s;e our lights &s;o to &s;hine before them, that they &s;eeing our good works, may be moved al&s;o to glorify our father which is in heaven.</P>

<HEAD>As an Introduction to the Ordination, the Reverend Mr. <HI>William Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> Moderator, thus apply'd him&s;elf to His Excellency the GOVERNOUR, being pre&s;ent.</HEAD>
<P>_IT having plea&s;ed the mo&s;t wi&s;e &amp; gracious GOD, who governs all things, to put it into the Hearts of a number of generous and well di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons in <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> to devote a part of their E&s;tate to promote the propagation of the knowledge of Chri&s;t, the only Saviour of a peri&s;hing World, among the Natives of <HI>America,</HI> who for an unknown number of Generations, have been ignorant of Him, and been peri&s;hing thro' lack of vi&s;ion: And this their Charity being under the direction of an honourable Corporati|on there, and a number of the Honourable and Re|verend Gentlemen here, of which Your Excellency is at the Head, being appointed as Commi&s;&s;ioners by them to direct and put forward that good Work; who now being &s;atisfied, after a con&s;iderable time of trial, of a good Di&s;po&s;ition in the Indians at <HI>Hou&s;&s;a|tonnoc</HI> and parts adjacent, to be in&s;tructed: And having obtained a fit Per&s;on for that great and diffi|cult but worthy Service; and there being now a num|ber of Pa&s;tors convened to &s;et him a part by &s;olemn Ordination to that Service; we humbly ask, if it be Your Excellency's Plea&s;ure, that we now proceed to it; and that a ju&s;t and proper care &s;hould be taken for his encouragement in it</P>
<P>To which His Excellency the Governour manife&s;ted His Approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003867_0045_1002666956149A68">It was then ask'd of the Per&s;on to be Ordained;</P>
<P>You now under&s;tand, <HI>Sir,</HI> That it is His Excel|lency's de&s;ire, in the Name of the Honourable and Reverend the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel among the Natives of <HI>New-England</HI>; That you would take upon you, that Mini&s;try and Service.</P>
<P>I now ask you, whether you are willing to con&s;e|crate your &s;elf and &s;ervice to Chri&s;t, and to the good of the Souls of tho&s;e poor People to whom you are &s;ent; who have hitherto &s;at in darkne&s;s and in the &s;hadow of Death; to take a Pa&s;toral care of them, and to &s;pend your time in a careful In&s;tructing of them in Chri&s;tian Knowledge.</P>
<P>To which Mr. <HI>Sargent,</HI> the Per&s;on deputed, gave his Con&s;ent.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="form of ordination">
<HEAD>Now follows the form u&s;ed in his Ordination.</HEAD>
<P>WE do now in the Name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and by virtue of the authority derived from Him, &s;et apart and Ordain you a Mini&s;ter of CHRIST, to &s;erve in the Affairs of his Kingdom, under the conduct and direction if his Providence; and e&s;peci|ally to take a Pa&s;toral Care of the Natives inhabiting at <HI>Hou&s;&s;atonnoc,</HI> and as many as will join them&s;elves with them and &s;ubmit to your In&s;truction. And to you are now committed the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, that what you bind on Earth &s;hould be bound in Heaven, and what you loo&s;e on Earth &s;hould be loo&s;ed in Heaven. In this Service it mu&s;t be your care to be prudent, faith|ful and diligent. You &s;hould remember that your Service is both honourable and difficult: It is honourable as be|ing a Service for the great GOD, who&s;e <HI>Name alone is excellent in all the Earth;</HI> and immediately a Service to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, for the &s;preading of his Glory, Name, and Kingdom in the World; whom the Father will have all Men to honour even as they honour Him&s;elf; who hath put the highe&s;t honour upon him in
<PB N="30" REF="003867_0046_1002074BB428E7C0">
rai&s;ing him from the dead, and giving him Glory, even that Glory which he had with him before the World was, and hath put this peculiar honour upon him as Mediator, in giving all power in Heaven and Earth to Him. We read that the greate&s;t Per&s;on that had been born of a Wo|man thought him&s;elf not worthy to hear his Shoes after him: And the holy Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, <HI>To me is this Grace given that I &s;hould preach among the Gentiles the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t.</HI> To preach CHRIST, &amp; the great Salvation he has wro't out for a &s;inful World, tho' at pre&s;ent far le&s;s profitable, yet is not le&s;s honourable than any Service that Men are imployed in in this World; and they who obtain mercy of the Lord to be faithful in it, and are in&s;trumental to turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&s;hall &s;hine as the Stars for ever &amp; ever.</HI></P>
<P>But GOD puts this &s;pecial honour upon you mini&s;teri|ally and declaratively, to lay a foundation of Chri&s;tian Knowledge, by preaching CHRIST, and teaching the fundamental Truths of the Go&s;pel among tho&s;e to whom they have not hitherto been made known. This was what the great Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> was ambitious of, to Preach the Go&s;pel, not where Chri&s;t was named, le&s;t he &s;hould build on another man's foundation.</P>
<P>Now this being your &s;pecial Province, I may mind you that it concerns you to u&s;e all that wi&s;dom and heavenly art you have, to lay a good Foundation, even to build on the Foundation of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, making JESUS CHRIST the chief corner Stone. And tho' I am not ignorant that it is hard and difficult exactly to de|termine what are &amp; what are not Fundamentals in Reli|gion, yet I &s;hall venture to mention &s;ome things which you mu&s;t teach that are the main Pillars which &s;upport the Chri&s;tian Building.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> Matters to be believed by us, which are plainly taught in the holy Scriptures, or by ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence inferred from them, to which you mu&s;t not add, nor dimini&s;h from, nor &s;hun to declare the whole coun&s;el of GOD.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="31" REF="003867_0047_1002666CC13163B0"><HI>2.</HI> The Wor&s;hip or Service of GOD, which is the vi&s;i|ble re&s;pect he requires his People to pay to Him: This is both natural and in&s;tituted: It mu&s;t be all and only that which He has appointed. Your &s;pecial duty as to this lies in Praying with and for tho&s;e that are commit|ted to your Charge. You mu&s;t not &s;in again&s;t the LORD in cea&s;ing to Pray for them. In Preaching the Word both in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on: and in your Preach|ing you mu&s;t be careful to Preach the Truths plainly, &s;ea|&s;onably, and convincingly, &s;o as to reach their Under|&s;tandings, Con&s;ciences and Affections: You mu&s;t admi|ni&s;ter the Sacraments of Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper to Per&s;ons duly qualified: Bapti&s;m to vi&s;ible Believers and their Seed, the Lord's Supper to &s;uch as can examine them&s;elves and di&s;cern the Lord's Body, and who are of a regular Conver&s;ation. You mu&s;t apply the Cen&s;ures to &s;uch as are &s;candalous or heretical to bring them to Re|pentance; doing all things without partiality, for <HI>he that acquitteth the Wicked, and he that condemns the Ju&s;t, are both of them an abomination to the Lord.</HI> You are al&s;o authoritatively to ble&s;s in the name of the LORD.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> The &s;piritual benefits of Ju&s;tification, Grace, Peace, and Salvation, that flow alone from CHRIST as the Head of his my&s;tical Body, and the grand Medium of all Divine Communication to us, are to be explained to them.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> Such Chri&s;tian Duties as are to be done and practi|&s;ed by all who profe&s;s them&s;elves the Di&s;ciples of CHRIST, that they may he kept in a &s;tate of Grace and Salvation, may honour their relation to CHRIST, and adorn the Profe&s;&s;ion they make. The&s;e are too many now to be enu|merated. And it will be a &s;pecial part of your Bu&s;ine&s;s to teach them the good Way and right Way in which they mu&s;t walk. If you do the&s;e things faithfully, you will be a Workman that need not to be a&s;hamed; you will ho|nour your great Lord and Ma&s;ter, will honour your &s;elf: And <HI>when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, you &s;hall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</HI></P>

They have al&s;o as others have had, their National and Hereditary Vices, which by long cu&s;tom they have been habituated to, &amp; have been hitherto uncon|vinced of the evil of, which &s;eems as hard to recover them from, as <HI>for the Ethiopian to change his skin, or the Leopard his &s;pots.</HI> The&s;e things will nece&s;&s;ary put you upon much A&s;&s;iduity, Watchfulne&s;s, and Prayer, that you may be furni&s;hed with the armour of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s on the right hand and on the left, with knowledge, Prudence, Patience, Meekne&s;s, Humility, Self-denial, and Zeal for the Honour of Chri&s;t, and the good of Souls; e&s;pecially that you may enjoy the promi&s;ed Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t always with you, to Guide, Strengthen, and Com|fort you in the Work he now calls you to; to who&s;e Grace we now commend you.</P>
