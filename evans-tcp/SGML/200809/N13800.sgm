<P>And I will put Enmity betwe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed: It &s;hall brui&s;e thy Head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his Heel.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words contain the fir&s;t Opening of the glo|rious Go&s;pel Day to poor lo&s;t Man.</P>
<P>Here is the fir&s;t Promi&s;e revealed by the glorious Deity, and the Foundation of all the re&s;t; which began in that Moment to be fulfilled, and will continue to bring forth its glorious Effects, throughout the periodical Eternities, or Ages of Ages, till all Things &s;hall be re&s;tored to their pri&s;|tine Perfection; and Sin and Sinners have no more a Name among the Creatures of God.</P>
<P>In order to have proper Ideas of the glorious Deity, we mu&s;t con&s;ider him as a Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Infinite Wi&s;|dom, Power, and Goodne&s;s; that he can only have one Will towards all his Creatures, which always continues the &s;ame and alters not thro' the Fall of any of them; but con|tinually manife&s;ts it&s;elf as a Will of Infinite Goodne&s;s towards them all, according to their various Circum&s;tances; &s;eeking their Recovery, and complete Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>Fury, Wrath, or Anger, can never dwell in the Fountain of Love, but are only to be found in fallen Nature, &s;epara|ted from the Life of God.</P>
<P>If Fury was in the glorious <HI>Jehovah,</HI> it mu&s;t have been an eternal, immutable, unbounded Wrath, that never could be extingui&s;hed; and viewed in that Light, he mu&s;t have forever been the mo&s;t unhappy of all Beings; for wherever Fury is found, Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Envy, and Pride are joined there|with: The&s;e are the four Elements of Hell or fallen Nature, and mutually generate each other.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="017441_0003_0FA11F0BF5B3CD80">But ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Triune God, he hath in|formed us that "He is Love" e&s;&s;entially, and mu&s;t there|fore be &s;o communicatively to all his Creatures.</P>
<P>The glorious Theme into which I am now about to enter, far exceeds what any human Heart can conceive, Tongue de|clare, or Pen de&s;cribe! O the Grandeur, the Beauty of this wonderful Pa&s;&s;age! Could I &s;peak&punc; with the Tongue of an Angel I &s;hould fall &s;hort, far &s;hort of the Glories it contains! How then &s;hall my feeble faultering unclean Lips attempt to utter the boundle&s;s Love! or proclaim the joyful News here revealed to peri&s;hing Creatures!</P>
<P>Expect not, my Brethren, that I &s;hall be able to fathom this Ocean of Love; there is enough contained here to employ my Tongue forever; but I hope to bring forth &s;ome refre&s;hing Drops at this Time, by which you may have a &s;mall Ta&s;te of its Sweetne&s;s. When the glorious <HI>Jehovah</HI> or <HI>Elohim</HI> created Nature at fir&s;t, it was pure, tran&s;parent, heavenly Sub&s;tan|tiality, de&s;cribed as "a Sea of Gla&s;s mingled with Fire;" into which all Matter mu&s;t finally return, through various Pro|ce&s;&s;es of Refinement. Out of this Nature God created Ho&s;ts of Angels, finite, and con&s;equently mutable Beings; as it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, and retain their Freedom of Will.</P>
<P>They were glorious Images and Re&s;emblances of the Deity; and &s;tood in the Life, Light, and Love, of the Tri|une God; manife&s;ted in Nature, by the threefold Properties of Fire, Light, and Spirit.</P>
<P>But <HI>Luci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er,</HI> the Son of the Morning, &s;eeking to enter into the fir&s;t Properties of Life, and turning his &s;trong Will and De&s;ire towards them, awakened Wrath in Nature; and found him&s;elf &s;hut up in his own chains of Darkne&s;s, together with all his Legions, who joined with him in his Rebellion; and thus one third Part of the Stars of Heaven fell into the dark Centre of Nature, and became incapable of bringing forth any Thing but Darkne&s;s, and Di&s;order around them.</P>
<P>Thus we can account for the "Earth being without Form, and void; and Darkne&s;s covering the deep:" A State which had no Po&s;&s;ibility of Exi&s;tence, till the Fall of Angels had in|troduced it into their Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now while the Good and Evil were at Strife with each other, the glorious God &s;topped the Progre&s;s of the Evil, by joining his Power to the fir&s;t Property of the De&s;ire, which became the Almighty Fiat; by which he congealed the whole together into &s;olid Bodies; and thereby prevented the Angels from introducing any more Wrath and Darkne&s;s into Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017441_0004_0FA11F0CB399DAA8">Then the Spirit of God "brooded upon the Face of the Deep;" baptizing the &s;ame with Light, that the heavenly Properties might be awakened or &s;tirred up; that &s;o Paradi&s;e might cover the Earth, hide the Cur&s;e, and bring forth its own proper Fruit.</P>
<P>After the Formation of all other Things, God &s;aid "Let us make Man in our own Image after our Likene&s;s; &amp;c." "So God created Man in his own Image," forming him out of the three Principles, viz. the Fire, which is the Root of all Life, the Water, or Meekne&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to qualify it, and the Principle called the third, viz. of this outward World, or Nature; which it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould be in him, in order that he might rule over the whole lower Creation, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing forth the Wonders of God therein; till it &s;hould ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain into the heavenly Sub&s;tantiality, from which it was &s;eparated.</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Adam</HI> created in the Image of God; having in him&s;elf a Birth of Life from the Father, Son, and Spirit. He had al&s;o the whole human Nature undivided in him; for he was both Male and Female in one.</P>
<P>He had Power over all the Elements, and over all the Crea|tures: Fire could not burn, nor Water drown him, neither could the Air &s;uffocate him, nor the Earth hinder his Cour&s;e: All the Creatures obeyed him; he knew all their Natures, in an angelical Manner; and was able to bring forth the Won|ders of God in this World, without feeling, knowing, or &s;eeing the Good, or Evil hid therein. He was joined with the pure Virgin of the Wi&s;dom of God, <HI>that</HI> was the Wife of his Youth, from whom by his Fall he was &s;eparated.</P>
<P>As his Soul was pure, &s;o was his Body; quite different from our dead, dark, gro&s;s, corrupted Bodies: His was lumin|ous, aegile, &s;piritual, as the Re&s;urrection Bodies &s;hall be.</P>
<P>Now we may &s;ee the true Nature of his Trial; it was not arbitrarily impo&s;ed upon him by God; neither was the Tree of Knowledge planted in the Garden on Purpo&s;e to tempt him, as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Under&s;tand the Matter thus:</P>
<P>Adam had in him the three Principles as mentioned before; now each of the&s;e &s;ought to bring forth its Wonders in him, and to one or the other his Will mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity incline.</P>
<P>The Root of Fire attracted him; the Meekne&s;s of the Light waited for him; and the Principle of the great World al&s;o drew him. Now his Eyes were &s;hut as to the bea&s;tly Life, he knew not the Good and Evil which it contained; he was to rule the Elements, and Creatures, by Virtue of the

Connection he had with them in the third Principle; but he was to take Care not to awaken their life in him&s;elf, nor fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ubjection to them; but to draw the whole temporary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> back again from whence it had fallen.</P>

<P>But as his Lu&s;t had conceived, and the fatal Tree was brought forth, the Drawing became &s;tronger than before; &s;o that his Fall became almo&s;t inevitable, or at lea&s;t his Trial was harder than before, according to the Nature of the Power of Attraction, as the De&s;ire began to be awakened.</P>
<P>Thus he &s;unk down into Sleep through the Power of Long|ing, by which he began to be captivated.</P>
<P>Then GOD &s;aid, <HI>IT is not good for Man to be alone, &amp;c.</HI> This &s;hows the Defection was begun; becau&s;e at his fir&s;t Cre|ation it was good, and very good; pronounced thus by GOD him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Therefore to prevert (if po&s;&s;ible) his falling into the bea&s;tial Life, or in ca&s;e of the Completion of his Fall, to provide a Re|medy, GOD &s;eparated the Female Part from him, formed a Woman, on whom he might place his Delight, and &s;till re|main ignorant of the animal Life.</P>
<P>But now the Drawing was grown &s;o powerful that our Pa|rents could no longer re&s;i&s;t, but took the Fruit, eat of the &s;ame, and immediately their Eyes were opened; the Life of this World ro&s;e up in them, and the divine Life was as &s;oon extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Their Souls lo&s;t the Perfection of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the divine Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="7" REF="017441_0006_0FA11F0F528CD720">
the white Garment; and were &s;hut up in Selfi&s;h|ne&s;s, Envy, Pride and Wrath; and their Bodies no longer lu|minous, became gro&s;s, dark, and bea&s;tial, filled with all Kinds of Lu&s;ts, and vicious Appetites: They were now fallen home to the World, had lo&s;t all Dominion over the Creatures and Elements, and had the Mortification to find them&s;elves Slaves, where before they had been Lords.</P>
<P>This their Fall was more deplorable than any Words can expre&s;s; Paradi&s;e was now hid from them; their Bodies be|came like Bea&s;ts, and their Souls like fallen Angels. In this forlorn Condition they lay, without any Power at all to rai&s;e them&s;elves up, any more than Lucifer had to regain his lo&s;t Glory.</P>
<P>Now then let us &s;ee whether there was Fury in GOD; or any Alteration produced in the <HI>Deity</HI> by the Fall of Man.</P>
<P>He came in the <HI>"Cool of the Day;"</HI> and after &s;etting be|fore them the State into which they had fallen, and the Con&s;e|quences of the &s;ame, which were inevitable, and not arbit|rarily denounced; he proceeded to this Threatening, con|taining the Day break of the Gos&s;el, <HI>"And I will put En|mity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed, it &s;hall brui&s;e thy Head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his Heel."</HI></P>
<P>As if God had &s;aid, "O thou envious De&s;troyer, do&s;t thou now imagine thou ha&s;t overthrown my Purpo&s;e, and di&s;ap|pointed all my De&s;igns? I will cau&s;e thy Malice to return into thine own Bo&s;om, and will manife&s;t my Power in the De&s;truction of thy Dominion; I will plant the Seed of the Woman where thou ha&s;t planted thine; and however long and &s;evere the Conte&s;t may be between the two Kingdoms, thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall be finally overthrown, thy Power &s;hall be en|tirely broken; all thy Captives taken from thee, and all the Evil thou ha&s;t introduced into Nature, &s;hall be entirely de&s;troyed; to my eternal Honor, and thine everla&s;ting Shame."</P>
<P>This was a Promi&s;e full of the mo&s;t important Realities and glorious Truths, upon the Suppo&s;ition of the univer&s;al Re&s;toration; but upon the common Sy&s;tems, almo&s;t without any Meaning at all; for if but a few &s;hall ever be made free from the Power of Sin, in what Sen&s;e can it be &s;aid, with Truth, that the Serpent's Head is brui&s;ed, or his Power de|&s;troyed?</P>
<P>This Promi&s;e was attended with the &s;ame divine Power, as when God &s;aid to the dark Chaos of fallen Nature, <HI>"Let there be Light,"</HI> Light immediately came; &s;o GOD no &s;ooner promi&s;ed the Seed of the Woman as a Brui&s;er of the Serpent,
<PB N="8" REF="017441_0007_0FA11F0FB49CFE80">
to the Parents of Mankind, but it was planted in their Brea&s;ts, as a Spark of the divine Life: from which Moment <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Incarnation, and Man's Re&s;toration was begun.</P>
<P>Now every Man that comes into the World, feels in him|&s;elf the Truth of his fallen, and Beginning of his re&s;tored State.</P>
<P>All that Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Envy, Pride and Wrath that we feel, proves that we have the Nature of the Devil; and all tho&s;e Lu&s;ts, and &s;en&s;ual Appetites that tyrannize over us, prove to a Demon&s;tration that we have the Image and Life of the Bea&s;t; &s;o al&s;o that &s;omething which &s;peaks within, checks us for our Sins, &s;eeks to turn us to God, call it what you will, Con&s;cience, or the Law written in the Heart, or Light of Nature, or whatever, it is the in&s;poken Seed of the Woman, and the Effect of that Promi&s;e, as really as all the Di&s;po&s;i|tions we feel to &s;in again&s;t God proceed from our fallen State.</P>
<P>This is "the true Light that lightens every Man that com|eth into the World." This is that immortal, "incorruptible Seed," of which we mu&s;t be born, before we can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>For as we have lo&s;t the Life of the Son, and Spirit of God, &s;o no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing can bring us again into a State of Happine&s;s, but a Birth of the &s;ame rai&s;ed up in us; by which we are created anew, and made the Sons of GOD, by having <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> formed in our Hearts, by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>We have this Rule given us in Scripture to know Spirits, and Teachers by, <HI>"Every Spirit that confe&s;&s;eth that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h is of God: And every Spirit that con|fe&s;&s;eth not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h is not of God."</HI> 1 John 4.2, 3.</P>
<P>They that cry, "Lo here is <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or "lo there," are not to be regarded.</P>
<P>All Deceivers of Mankind take this Way, they will endea|vour to per&s;uade you, that you can have no Salvation, but by at|tending to their In&s;tructions, adhering to their Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iments, join|ing with their Party, following their Modes, &amp;c. whereas <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Mini&s;ters direct Man to that Seed of the Woman which is within; they &s;eek to rai&s;e, or &s;tir up that which is hidden there in Darkne&s;s. Thus <Q>when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was demanded of the Phari&s;ees, when the Kingdom of God &s;hould come;</Q> he an&s;wered them and &s;aid, <Q>The Kingdom of God cometh not with Ob&s;ervation. Neither &s;hall they &s;ay, Lo here, or lo there; for behold the Kingdom of God is within you.</Q> Luke xvii. 20, 21.</P>
<P>Here Chri&s;t him&s;elf called the Phari&s;ees to behold that the Kingdom of God was within them; and if within tho&s;e who
<PB N="9" REF="017441_0008_0FA11F107379B430">
are el&s;ewhere called "Serpents and Vipers," and threatened with "the Damnation of Hell," then certainly in all Man|kind.</P>
<P>This divine Seed is the only Beginning and Po&s;&s;ibility of a new Life; and unle&s;s the Means of Grace can reach that hidden Spark, they can do us no Good. And it is al&s;o cer|tain, that unle&s;s there was a Seed hidden in our Souls, ca|pable of being rai&s;ed up by the Power and Attraction of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> nothing from without could take any Effect upon us, or rai&s;e up the divine Life in us, any more than the Sun, Air, and Water of this World, could cau&s;e a Flint to vegetate, like a Corn of Wheat, or any other Seed. For as Vegetation is produced by the Power of the Elements attracting the Seed, which has their Nature &s;hut up in it, and which longs to break forth out of a State of Confinement, &s;o <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> rai&s;es up the divine Life, by attracting that in us which is an Emanation from him, and longs for his coming, as the impri&s;oned Seed, &s;hut up in Death and Darkne&s;s, longs for the Influences of the Heavens to rai&s;e it up to Life.</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee there is nothing arbitrary; all is natural throughout the whole Proce&s;s; nothing can ri&s;e up but ac|cording to the Po&s;&s;ibilities of Nature. If the be&s;t of Seed was &s;own, and you &s;hould cover it over with Stones, or hard Bo|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and then blame the Sun, becau&s;e it did not cau&s;e the &s;ame to &s;pring up and grow; it would be a faint Picture of the Impiety of tho&s;e who blame the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> that Salvation doth not come to them; for all that hinders the divine Life from &s;pringing up in every Heart, is the Oppo&s;itions that are made to it, the Ob&s;tructions that hinder it.</P>
<P>Now as it is impo&s;&s;ible for the Sun, Water, and Air, to rai&s;e up the be&s;t of Seed, if covered over with Mountains of Rocks, till they are removed or di&s;&s;olved; &s;o we may account why all are not brought alike &s;oon and ea&s;ily to the State of di|vine Life in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; it is becau&s;e of different Ob&s;tructions that hinder. As in one Place <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> could not do many migh|ty Works becau&s;e of their Unbelief; and at another Time &s;aid, <HI>"How hardly &s;hall they that have Riches enter into the King|dom of God!"</HI></P>
<P><HI>"It is ea&s;ier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God."</HI></P>
<P>Surely this implied more than common Difficulty, more than common Ob&s;tacles to be removed!</P>
<P>Herein &s;tands the whole Foundation of the Go&s;pel; we have lo&s;t the divine Life, and have rai&s;ed up in our&s;elves the Life of this World, by falling into the Spirit of the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="017441_0009_0FA11F1132D74DF8">Now could GOD by an arbitrary Act have rai&s;ed us up, he would have done it; he wanted not Love; but we had died to that Life, which we had from the Son of GOD, and opened in our&s;elves the Life of the Bea&s;t; which of Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be &s;acrificed, de&s;troyed, and &s;lain, in order that the former &s;hould ri&s;e up in its primitive Perfection, and bring forth a Birth of it&s;elf within us. And thus we find and &s;ee the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the Son of GOD's being an in&s;poken Seed, and be|coming Man, going through all the Stages of our Life, from his Birth to his Death. It was that he might de&s;troy the Na|ture of the old Man in us, that he might rai&s;e up the new Man, or give us a Principle of Life divine, and thereby be|come as truly, and in as proper a Sen&s;e our Father as <HI>Adam</HI> was.</P>
<P>That as we received a fallen corrupt Nature from <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o we might be made Partakers of a divine Nature from <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore all the Di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD under the Law, Prophets, or Go&s;pel, were calculated for the &s;ame Purpo&s;es; viz. that Sin might be manife&s;ted and de&s;troyed, and the Life, or Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> might be revealed and re&s;tored.</P>
<P><HI>Thus</HI> we read, <HI>"Moreover the Law entered that the Offence might abound;"</HI> that <HI>"it was added, becau&s;e of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, till the Seed &s;hould come, to whom the Promi&s;e was made." &amp;c.</HI> Rom. v. 20. GaL iii. 19.</P>
<P>All the Sacrifices &s;lain, offered, con&s;umed and eaten, point|ed out the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s taking our Nature upon him, and &s;acrificing that Life which belonged to this World, which he overcame; and giving his &s;piritual Fle&s;h and Blood to be|come in us a new Life, and the Support of it, as really as we had derived an earthly bea&s;tial Life from <HI>Adam,</HI> which was &s;upported with the Food produced by the&s;e Elements.</P>
<P>The Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was &s;hed for us, to de&s;troy, by its pow|erful Efficacy, all the Evil in fallen Nature; a glorious Pre|&s;age of which was &s;een when it was poured out; it cau&s;ed the Rocks to &s;plit, the Vail to be rent in twain, the Earth to quake, the Graves to open. Its Power over fallen Nature is increa&s;ing every Day; this cau&s;es &s;uch univer&s;al Commotions, and it will &s;hake, and remove all Things that can be &s;haken, till all Nature &s;hall be &s;ubject to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and Evil be no more.</P>
<P>Now we &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of the whole Proce&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> agreeable to the Scriptures, that <HI>"Fora&s;much as that Children are Partakers of Fle&s;h and Blood, he al&s;o him&s;elf likewi&s;e took Part of the &s;ame, that through Death he might de&s;troy him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil."</HI> Heb. ii. 14.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="017441_0010_0FA11F11F4404C08">He went through every Stage of our Lives, overcame all the Evil in Nature in his own Body, that we through him might overcome all; he pa&s;&s;ed through Death, died out of the World into Paradi&s;e, as <HI>Adam</HI> died out of Paradi&s;e into the World; he poured out his Blood in the Gate of the &s;econd Death, to break the Power of the &s;ame, that he might &s;et the Pri&s;oners free; and thus exactly rever&s;ed all that the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> had done; that he might become the Fountain and Father of all his wretched Progeny, and re&s;tore to us all that we have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Now the whole Proce&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> from his becoming the in&s;poken Word, or Seed of the Woman, till he &s;hall re&s;ign the Kingdom to the Father, is, and will be of U&s;e to us, in the&s;e two Re&s;pects:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to de&s;troy that Life of Fle&s;h and Blood, which cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and &s;econdly, to rai&s;e up in us that divine Image, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or Life, that may &s;it us to &s;tand in his Pre&s;ence. The whole of Religion is con|tained here; the one Thing needful is, to have the Proce&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> carried on in us, till we &s;tand complete in that divine Nature which we derive from him. Here let us be willing to have the Fle&s;h of the natural Man poured out like D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng, and his Blood like Du&s;t, that we may be clothed with that Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in which alone we can &s;tand in the Pre&s;ence of the Lord.</P>
<P>This, whether it be called the wedding Garment, the Hou&s;e from Heaven, the fine Linen, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Saints, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Ju&s;tification, or any other Name, is the &s;ame Thing; and is, when complete, the whole we need to make us happy; for though it is called by various Names, it no more intends different Things, than <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is different from <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> or the Lamb of GOD, or the Bread of Life, or the Foundation Stone, or Saviour of the World; for all the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed of him, not to divide his Per|fections, but to &s;how his Suitablene&s;s to our Needs.</P>
<P>It would be well for Mankind if they would lay a&s;ide all Strife about Words and Names, and attend wholly to this "one Thing needful," to have <HI>"Chri&s;t</HI> formed in them, the Hope of Glory." Perhaps &s;ome may think we &s;et up &s;omething within, in the Room of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as di&s;tinct from the Son of GOD, born of <HI>Mary</HI>; but that is as fal&s;e a Suppo&s;ition, as though any &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that when I &s;ay, the Sun is in the Hou&s;e, I mean &s;omething di&s;tinct from the Sun in the Firmament; when they mu&s;t know that I mean the Rays of that one Body that enlightens the whole
<PB N="12" REF="017441_0011_0FA11F12B274ABF8">
World, is the &s;ame in all Parts of it, the Whole to every Man, yet is but the &s;ame to all, in all, and for all; that &s;hine every where freely, where it meets with no Ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>Or if I was to &s;ay, There mu&s;t be the Nature of Fire, Water and Air, in a Seed, in order to produce Vegetation or Growth; they &s;hould imagine that I &s;et up the Elements within, as di|&s;tinct from tho&s;e without it, when it would ea&s;ily appear that I intended a Birth of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>For if there was not the Nature of the Sun in the Grain, the Sun could not draw it up out of the earthly Part, leaving the Hu&s;k to die in the Ground: Yet was not the Sun to &s;hine &s;o as to reach it with his Beams, it never could ri&s;e up to Life.</P>
<P>This &s;hows plainly the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> coming into the World, in order to rai&s;e up that Life which was lo&s;t; by calling forth through his divine Influences, that Seed which he had planted in Man, which was an Emanation from him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>So we may con&s;ider the Seed of the Woman as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him|&s;elf, whether as in&s;poken to <HI>Adam,</HI> manife&s;ted to <HI>Abraham,</HI> revealed to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Prophets, or born of <HI>Mary</HI>: In his Birth, Life, Death, Re&s;urrection, A&s;cen&s;ion, Se&s;&s;ion at GOD's right Hand, and Interce&s;&s;ion there, he is carrying on the &s;ame work which he begun in <HI>Adam</HI>; and only differs from it, as the &s;everal Manife&s;tations of the Sun, until it comes to the Meridian, differs from the fir&s;t Break of Day. Therefore the Light of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in Man is not &s;omething di&s;tinct from divine Revelation, much le&s;s in Oppo&s;ition to it; but is the Beginning of it, and &s;tands in the &s;ame Need of farther Manife&s;tations as the Breaking of Day does of the Ri&s;ing of the Sun.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavored to make this Matter as plain as I can, that you may &s;ee the Beauty of the glorious My&s;teries of our Redemption; and be led mo&s;t earne&s;tly to de&s;ire, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> might ri&s;e up within you as the Hope of Glory; rai&s;e up in you the lo&s;t Image of GOD; de&s;troy Sin out of your Souls, by brui&s;ing the Serpent's Head; and give you that Knowledge which is Life eternal.</P>
<P>We find it is expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted in the Text, "That the Seed of the Woman &s;hall brui&s;e the Serpent's Head." Now as the Serpent's Head, or Power, is found in every Man, &s;o it mu&s;t be brui&s;ed in every Man, if ever the&s;e Words are perfect|ly fulfilled.</P>
<P>From hence follows the Doctrine of the final Re&s;titution of all Things, which de&s;erves a particular Con&s;ideration, as it has been for a long Time greatly clouded over with <HI>Antichri&s;tian</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="017441_0012_0FA11F1372BB55D0">
Darkne&s;s. Now to demon&s;trate this Truth, wee need only inquire what the De&s;ign of God in creating finite Intelligences <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s? Even the A&s;&s;embly of Divines were &s;o &s;en&s;ible that GOD's De&s;ign in creating finite Intelligences, could only be to make them eternally happy in the Enjoyment of him&s;elf; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in An&s;wer to their fir&s;t Que&s;tion, "What is the chief End of Man?" they &s;ay, "Man's chief End is to glorify God, and enjoy him for ever." A glorious End this; but which, according to them, is to be eternally fru&s;trated, and never accompli&s;hed, except in a very few of the human Race. I &s;hall therefore, for the Satisfaction of all &s;erious Inquirers, treat a little of the final Subjection of all rebellious Beings; and of Con&s;equence, final Re&s;toration of all lap&s;ed Creatures. This Doctrine I &s;hall prove from plain Scripture Arguments. GOD &s;ays, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xlv. 23. <HI>"I have &s;worn by my&s;elf, the Word is gone out of my Mouth in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hall not return, that unto me every Knee &s;hall bow, and every Tongue &s;hall &s;wear."</HI></P>
<P>If we ob&s;erve the Words, we &s;hall find that GOD here promi&s;eth to bring all Creatures to return again to their Al|legiance; not one &s;hall to all endle&s;s Eternity remain in Re|bellion again&s;t him; for &s;wearing to him plainly &s;uppo&s;es a hearty returning.</P>
<P>Therefore if every Knee &s;hall bow, and every Tongue &s;hall &s;wear, then not one &s;hall remain to all Eternity in Oppo&s;ition to GOD.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t is true, therefore al&s;o the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus as long as Rebellion again&s;t GOD la&s;ts, Mi&s;ery mu&s;t la&s;t al&s;o.</P>
<P>But Rebellion again&s;t GOD will not la&s;t to all Eternity.</P>
<P>Neither then will Mi&s;ery la&s;t to all Eternity. <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> lvii. 16, <HI>"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the Spirit &s;hould fail before me, and the Souls which I have made."</HI> If GOD will not contend for ever, the Time mu&s;t come when none &s;hall &s;tand in Oppo&s;ition to him.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t is true, therefore al&s;o the la&s;t.</P>
<P>GOD gives this Rea&s;on why he will not be always wroth, becau&s;e he is the "Father of Spirits and the Creator of Souls." This Rea&s;on is univer&s;al without Exception, and equally re|gards all intelligent Beings; and unle&s;s &s;ome can be found that are not created by GOD, none can be found that will be to all Eternity mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>But none can be found that are not the Creatures of GOD; therefore none can be eternally mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ure us in <HI>Philippians</HI> ii. 9, 10, 11. that <HI>God</HI>

becau&s;e of the Saviour's Sufferings, <HI>"hath given him a Name which is above every Name; that at the Name of</HI> Je&s;us <HI>every Knee &s;hould bow, of Things in Heaven, Things in Earth, and Things under the Earth: And that every Tongue &s;hould confe&s;s that</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>is Lord to the glory and Prai&s;e of God the Fa|ther."</HI></P>
<P>And whoever will con&s;ider, that all in Heaven, on Earth, and under the Earth, &s;hall bow and confe&s;s in the &s;ame Man|ner, and for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, mu&s;t I think be convinced of the Truth of the Doctrine.</P>
<P>In <HI>Colo&s;&s;ians</HI> i. 20. We read, <HI>"And having made peace through the Blood of his Cro&s;s, by him to reconcile all Things un|to him&s;elf, by him I &s;ay whether they be things in Earth or Things in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Here we find all Things &s;hall be reconciled to GOD again, by the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Can any one doubt of this who has ever been reconciled him&s;elf? Then <HI>"every Creature which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth, and &s;uch as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, &s;hall</HI> &s;ay <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing, and Honor, and Glory, and Power, be unto him that &s;itteth on the Throne, and unto the Lamb, forever and ever."</HI> Rev. v. 13.</P>
<P>Here is no Exception of any one of the whole Creation; all join the univer&s;al Chorus, to prai&s;e GOD, and the Lamb. This is enough to convince any one that believes the Scrip|tures, of the Truth of the univer&s;al Re&s;toration of all Things. There are a Number of Pa&s;&s;ages which &s;how that there will be a Time when Death &s;hall be de&s;troyed, &s;wallowed up in Victo|ry, lo&s;e his Sting, &amp;c. &s;uch are <HI>I&s;aih,</HI> xxv. 3. <HI>Ho&s;ea,</HI> xiii. 14. I. <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 22&mdash;29, 54, 55, 56. <HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 4, 5. The&s;e five &s;trong and plain Pa&s;&s;ages prove that even Death, the la&s;t Enemy, &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Now if the la&s;t Enemy &s;hall be de&s;troyed&punc; there &s;hall not be one left.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t is true, therefore al&s;o the la&s;t.</P>
<P>It would be very ab&s;urd to &s;ay, "The la&s;t Enemy is de|&s;troyed, but many Millions &s;hall remain to all Eternity."</P>
<P>Now while Creatures are unreconciled to GOD, they are his Enemies; but the Time will come when he &s;hall not have one Enemy remaining. Therefore all Creatures &s;hall be re|conciled.</P>
<P>If all Creatures &s;hall be finally reconciled, all &s;hall be final|ly re&s;tored.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t is true, therefore al&s;o the la&s;t.</P>
<P>While Sin remains in Being, Death will be able to &s;hew his Sting; but the Time will come when Death &s;hall have no Sting to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="017441_0014_0FA11F14F31FC4C0">Therefore Sin &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>And to this agree the Words of Scripture, as it is written, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 8. <HI>"For this Purpo&s;e the Son of God was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the Works of the Devil,"</HI> Unle&s;s <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> final|ly de&s;troys the Works of the Devil, even all Sin out of the Univer&s;e, his Purpo&s;e mu&s;t be eternally fru&s;trated:</P>
<P>But the la&s;t can never be: Therefore the fir&s;t is true.</P>
<P>We read <HI>Romans</HI> v. 20. <HI>"But where Sin abounded, Grace did much more abound,"</HI> l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is evident that Sin has abounded to the De&s;truction of all Men: Now if Grace abounds more, it is evident that all mu&s;t be at la&s;t re&s;tored thereby; otherwi&s;e there is no Shadow of Truth in the Words.</P>
<P>Therefore if Grace &s;hall abound more than Sin, it mu&s;t be as exten&s;ive, and more powerful:</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t is true, therefore the la&s;t al&s;o.</P>
<P>Now if all are not re&s;tored, it mu&s;t be owing either to the Want of Will, or Power, in the Deity to re&s;tore them; but none can deny his Will without contradicting <HI>St. Paul,</HI> i. <HI>Timothy</HI> ii. 1 to 7. and many other plain Pa&s;&s;ages: And who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are &s;ay, that his Power and Wi&s;dom are not &s;ufficient to ful|fill his Purpo&s;es? Some <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> indeed &s;ay, GOD is able, but it is not his Will; others &s;uppo&s;e, nay affirm, that he is willing, yea willeth the Re&s;toration of all; and yet it never &s;hall be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e Ideas of the Deity are highly di&s;honoring to GOD; both pave the Way to Infidelity, and Athei&s;m; nor is it to be wondered at, that &s;o many renounce Religion altogether, when they hear &s;uch contradictory Accounts of it, from its profe&s;&s;ed Friends and Advocates.</P>
<P>But ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, there is no Contradiction in the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> it is his Will to re&s;tore all again to him&s;elf, and he has Power to effect it:</P>
<P>Therefore it &s;hall be done.</P>
<P>I have the Plea&s;ure to find that Writers, and Di&s;puters again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> have never entered into the Grounds of it; and con&s;equently have never under&s;tood it. They have only fought in general again&s;t a GOD in whom Fury was to be found, and who made his Creatures with a determinate Purpo&s;e to damn them to all Eternal Ages; and therefore de|creed their evil Actions, that he might have a Colour of Right to condemn them.</P>
<P>They have fought again&s;t Original Sin, becau&s;e they never under&s;tood any Thing more about it than that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin was imputed to all his Children; and they condemned for it&punc; as though they had been the real Actors. As for Puni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="16" REF="017441_0015_0FA11F15B5145548">
they have never under&s;tood it in any other Light than an arbitrary Infliction upon the Sinner, by the Deity; in&s;tead of being as natural a Con&s;equence of Sin, as Pain is of bro|ken Bones.</P>
<P>The Atonement of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> they have rejected, without under|&s;tanding the lea&s;t of its De&s;ign: Oh, would they but con&s;ider that the Scripture never repre&s;ents it as intended to quench, or put out, a Wrath that was ri&s;en in the Deity; but to break the Power of Death in us, and overcome the Wrath of fallen Nature; to rai&s;e a new Life in our Souls, and bring both fallen Nature and Creatures back into their fir&s;t State of Purity and Perfection! If they under&s;tood the Matter thus, they could never fight again&s;t the glorious Doctrine of Atonement by the precious Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> without which we never could have been rai&s;ed to GOD, any more than a Rock, while its Hardne&s;s remains, can ri&s;e into Aether. The &s;ame Rea&s;on that a hard Rock cannot expand it&s;elf, becau&s;e it is &s;hut up in its own Darkne&s;s, Gro&s;sne&s;s, and Hardne&s;s, until it is melted or di&s;&s;olved, may be given why our Souls, filled with Sin, and &s;hut up in Death and Darkne&s;s, are by no Means able to ri&s;e to GOD, until that State of Death in which we are &s;hut up, is di&s;&s;olved. Now the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is able, and will finally di&s;&s;olve all Hardne&s;s in Nature; and quench all Wrath in Creatures. It was evident when the Saviour died, that his Blood had a phy&s;ical Power over Nature, by the Effects it pro|duced, in cau&s;ing the Earth to &s;hake, the Rocks to rend, and the Graves to open. This phy&s;ical Virtue of the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> prevails more and more, and will prevail through the Ages of Ages, until all tormenting Envy, &s;elfi&s;h Wills, &s;tub|orn Pride, fiery Wrath, Darkne&s;s, Gro&s;sne&s;s, Death, and Hardne&s;s, &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>Oh, that all the <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> would attend to what is within their own Brea&s;ts! There lies the Truth of all I have advanced. There they might feel their own undone State, and there they might find the Seed of the Woman.</P>
<P>I would no more advi&s;e them to read over all that has been written on both Sides, in Order to be convinced of the Truth of the Reality of Religion, than I would advi&s;e them to go on a Pilgrimage to <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> I would advi&s;e them to be will|ing to feel their Want and Mi&s;ery, and to hunger and thir&s;t after that Deliverance which the Go&s;pel brings.</P>
<P>The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith &s;aith, <HI>"Say not in thine Heart, who &s;hall a&s;cend into Heaven? That is to bring down</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>from above. Or who &s;hall de&s;cend into the Deep? That is to bring up</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>again from the Dead. But what &s;aith it? The

It is as if I &s;hould &s;ay to a Thou&s;and Criminals under Sentence of Death, "I have the mo&s;t charming News to proclaim to you all; Which is, that ten of you are to be reprieved, and all the re&s;t are to &s;uffer, without the lea&s;t Chance of Remedy, or Re|lea&s;e." I only a&s;k what they might be &s;uppo&s;ed to think of me and my in&s;ulting Declaration? Would they not judge that I came on purpo&s;e to aggravate their Mi&s;ery, by fir&s;t rai&s;ing their Expectations with a Fal&s;hood, and then de&s;troying all their Hopes by the Truth? In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, an in&s;ulting Liar, would be the be&s;t Name I could de&s;erve. Now, &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did not die for all Men; can any Per&s;on tell me what <HI>"Good News"</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly be proclaimed to every one, without they will call endle&s;s Damnation <HI>"Good News!"</HI> For this mu&s;t be all the good News, and glad Tidings of great Joy, that can be publi&s;hed to them for whom the <HI>Saviour</HI> did not die!</P>
<P>But ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, we are a&s;&s;ured the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was for all without Exception.</P>
<P>And indeed whoever con&s;iders a Moment, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> could die for all, as ea&s;ily as for one, mu&s;t think that he did not limit his Death to one in a Thou&s;and, or a &s;mall Part of his Creatures.</P>
<P>Let every one therefore "&s;eek the <HI>Lord</HI> while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near;" and &s;eriou&s;ly apply to him. "who is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to GOD through him;" "who will have all Men to be re&s;tored, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth: For there is one GOD, and one Mediator between GOD and Man, the Man <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI>; who gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due Time."</P>
<P>I have not at this Time entered largely into the Arguments for the univer&s;al Re&s;toration, having &s;everal Times treated profe&s;&s;edly upon the Subject: Neither have I here attempted to an&s;wer the Objections commonly made to it, having an|&s;wered them in a former Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Glorious Doctrine is built upon the following Propo|&s;itions, which mu&s;t be proved to be fal&s;e, before it can be overthrown:</P>
<P N="1">I. GOD is Love, e&s;&s;entially, and communicatively, and
<PB N="18" REF="017441_0017_0FA11F1874432680">
loves all the Beings he hath made, con&s;idered as his Creatures, and is con&s;tantly &s;eeking to do them Good.</P>
<P N="2">II. GOD's De&s;ign in creating intelligent Beings, was to make them happy in the Knowledge and Love of his Glori|ous Perfections.</P>

<P N="4">IV. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died for all; and died not in vain.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> came to de&s;troy the evil Principle, or Sin out of the Univer&s;e, which he will finally effect; and then Mi&s;ery &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>Here are the Merits of the Cau&s;e; the&s;e Propo&s;itions are &s;ome of them &s;elf evident, and the others admit of the fulle&s;t Demon&s;tration, or Scripture Proof: and till the&s;e the Founda|tion Principles are overthrown, all Attempts again&s;t the Doctrine are vain.</P>
<P>Glory to GOD in the highe&s;t, we believe the Time will come when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> "&s;hall &s;ee of the Travel of his Soul and be &s;atisfied;" when the Serpent's Head &s;hall be brui&s;ed;" "all Things put under the Feet of the Mediator;" and finally, "the Kingdom delivered up to the Father, that GOD may be ALL IN ALL."

<P>The&s;e eight Pa&s;&s;ages are all that I remember where the Word everla&s;ting or eternal is u&s;ed for the Continuance of the Mi&s;ery of fallen Creatures.</P>
<P>Now I &s;hall not cavil as &s;ome do, pretending that Sins, and not Per&s;ons, are intended by the wicked ones; nor as others, who would in&s;inuate, that everla&s;ting or eternal only &s;ets forth the Nature of the Fire, and not the Continuance of Mi&s;ery.

<P>Every one who reads the Scripture mu&s;t know that the Word forever intends an Age, Period, or Eternity, as may be &s;een by the following Pa&s;&s;ages; which let any one take the Bible and read, and they will &s;ee it as plain as the Sun.</P>

<P>The&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages &s;how that nothing can be concluded from the Word forever in Favor of endle&s;s Torments, &s;ince here are more than three&s;core Pa&s;&s;ages where it is u&s;ed for a limited Time, beyond Contradiction; and many more might be ad|ded, if nece&s;&s;ary. This obviates a &s;econd Objection taken from the Words forever and ever, which are u&s;ed in &s;everal Places for the Continuance of the Torments of the Damned.</P>
<P>As in <HI>Rev</HI> xiv. 11. And the Smoke of their Torment a&s;|cendeth up forever and ever; and they have no Re&s;t Day nor Night, who wor&s;hip the Bea&s;t and his Image, &amp;c.</P>

Therefore if forever means a Period, Age, or Eter|nity, as has been &s;hown by more than &s;ixty Pa&s;&s;ages, then forever and ever mu&s;t mean Ages, Periods, Eternities, or Ages of Ages; as is clearly &s;hewn by the forecited Texts.</P>
<P>Thus if any would &s;uppo&s;e that the Words forever and ever mean any more than the &s;imple Word forever, it is rea|dily gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d; but then that overthrows the Notion of their intending infinite Duration; for if forever and ever contain more than forever, then &s;urely more in &s;ome Proportion, and if in any Proportion, then both intend limited Duration: th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugh both forever and forever and ever are &s;ometimes ap|plied to Things which being unchangeable in their own Na|tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e can have no End, as the Being and Perfections of God; yet their being &s;ometimes applied to tho&s;e Things which by a Nece&s;&s;ity or Nature mu&s;t endure to all Eternity, does by no Means alter the proper Signification of tho&s;e Words.</P>
<P>Therefore it mu&s;t be very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that when the Words forever and ever are u&s;ed in &s;ome Places of Scripture, re&s;pecting Times and Things which other Pa&s;&s;ages a&s;&s;ure us mu&s;t end, that the bare U&s;e of tho&s;e Words alters the Nature of Things, and contradicts the other Scriptures.</P>
<P>Now though the Pa&s;&s;ages before mentioned, intimate that Pain, Sorrow, and the &s;econd Death &s;hall la&s;t forever and ever, yet there are many other Places in Scripture that de|clare that the Time &s;hall come when the&s;e &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>As <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xxv. 8. He will &s;wallow up Death in V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away Tears from off all Faces.</P>

<P>54&punc; Then &s;hall be brought to pa&s;s the Saying that is writ|ten, Death is &s;wallowed up in Victory.</P>
<P>55. O Death where <HI>is</HI> thy Sting? O Grave (or Hell) where <HI>is</HI> thy Victory.</P>
<P>56. The Sting of Death <HI>is</HI> Sin.</P>
<P><HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 14. Fora&s;much then as the Children are parta|kers of Fle&s;h and Blood, he al&s;o him&s;elf likewi&s;e took Part of the &s;ame; that through Death he might de&s;troy him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil.</P>
<P><HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 4. And God &s;hall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there &s;hall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying; neither &s;hall there be any more Pain: for the former Things are pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, and many others, it is plain that all that bears the Name of Death &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>Therefore, in order to make the&s;e Scriptures con&s;i&s;tent one with another, we mu&s;t allow the Words <HI>forever and ever</HI> to intend certain Periods, or Ages of Ages, which mu&s;t have an End.</P>
<P>A third Objection is taken from tho&s;e Words of our Sa|viour.</P>
<P><HI>Matt.</HI> xii. 31. Wherefore I &s;ay unto you, All Manner of Sin and Bla&s;phemy &s;hall be forgiven unto Men; but the Bla&s;|phemy <HI>again&s;t</HI> the <HI>Holy</HI> Gho&s;t &s;hall not be forgiven unto Men.</P>
<P>32. And who&s;oever &s;peaketh again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Son of Man, it &s;hall be forgiven him: but who&s;oever &s;peaketh again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven him, neither in this World, (Age or Period) neither in the <HI>World</HI> to come.</P>
<P>Here the Enemies of the glorious Re&s;toration pretend to tri|umph; but with how little Rea&s;on &s;hall be left to the candid Reader.</P>
<P>It is plain and evident that our Saviour meant to &s;et forth <HI>that</HI> Sin as more terrible in its Con&s;equences than any other. But according to the common Opinion, that all who die in Sin, even the Heathen, &s;hall be puni&s;hed to all Eternity, without a Po&s;&s;ibility of Relea&s;e, there is Nothing more to be feared from dying in that Sin than any other.</P>
<P>All Writers acknowledge that the Lo&s;s of GOD is the greate&s;t Part of Hell Torments; but this all mu&s;t &s;uffer who are bani&s;hed from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord alike (according to the common Sy&s;tems); and if this is to continue to all Eter|nity, it reduces this Sin, and the Mi&s;ery attending it, to a Level with the Sin of an idle Word; which de&s;troys all Equi|ty
<PB N="41" REF="017441_0040_0FA11D9973C2D2F0">
and Ju&s;tice, and makes Non&s;en&s;e of the terrible Doom the dear Redeemer denounces again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;in the Sin unto Death.</P>
<P>This Pa&s;&s;age, upon a Suppo&s;ition that it contradicts the Univer&s;al Re&s;toration, proves more than the Objectors are willing to acknowledge; for it declares a Po&s;&s;ibility, a Pro|bability, if not a Certainty, that all other Sins may and &s;hall be forgiven, either in this World, or Age, or in the World, or Age to come; or el&s;e why is the World (or Age) to come mentioned?</P>
<P>If we compare the &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages which &s;peak of this dreadful Sin together, &s;uch as <HI>Matt.</HI> xii. 31, 32. <HI>Mark</HI> iii. 28, 29, 30. <HI>Luke</HI> xii. 10. <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 4, 5, 6. x. 26,&mdash;to 31.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 1.&mdash;I. <HI>John</HI> v. 16. We &s;hall find that it is a different Sin from all others; being a direct, wilful, malicious, contumacious, continued Oppo&s;ition to divine Love, and to all the Methods of Re&s;toration which in the pre&s;ent World can be u&s;ed: and of Con&s;equence &s;uch mu&s;t know by &s;ad Ex|perience, what it is to have their Part with the Devil, and his Angels, the Bea&s;t, and fal&s;e Prophet, in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone; which is the &s;econd Death.</P>
<P>And this will not only la&s;t while the World to come, or Millennium la&s;ts, but even after that, for an Age of Ages, or Ages of Ages (for &s;uch our Saviour has declared, are in Danger of eternal Damnation). Not becau&s;e the Lord is not willing to re&s;tore them &s;ooner, but becau&s;e they have gone &s;o deep into Sin, that it will require a long and &s;evere Proce&s;s to reclaim them.</P>
<P>But as the Time mu&s;t come when all &s;hall be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, and he &s;hall de&s;troy Death the la&s;t Enemy, by de&s;troying Sin, which is the Sting of Death; &s;o this Sin as well as Others &s;hall be no more. For if this was not to be the Ca&s;e it never could be true that "where Sin abounded Grace did much more abound;" for it never would abound quite &s;o much. Neither would Death and Hell be &s;ilent when God &s;hall a&s;k the grand Que&s;tion. "O Death where is thy Sting? O Grave (or Hell) where is thy Victory?" For Death could &s;ay, "Here is my Sting, <HI>that</HI> Sin again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, which mu&s;t endure to all Eternity, and which even divine Grace &s;hall never de&s;troy; I have therefore the Victory and Dominion over the&s;e, and will hold it, while God him&s;elf remains."</P>
<P>Then <HI>Death could never be de&s;troyed, nor &s;wallowed up in Victory:</HI> neither would <HI>Sorrow, crying,</HI> and <HI>Pain</HI> cea&s;e: neither could God ever be <HI>All in all</HI>; in any other Sen&s;e with re&s;pect to them than he is now: nor would <HI>every Tongue &s;wear</HI>: neither
<PB N="42" REF="017441_0041_0FA11D9A31C0BD78">
<HI>all Things</HI> ever be <HI>made new</HI>: The Univer&s;al Chorus of Prai&s;e could never be &s;ung by <HI>every Creature in Heaven, on Earth, and under the Earth:</HI> And finally the Scriptures would never be entirely fulfilled.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Con&s;equences that follow, only from the Suppo&s;ition that &s;ome &s;hall remain God's Enemies to all Eter|nity; what dreadful Con&s;equences mu&s;t then be drawn from that Doctrine, that teaches that almo&s;t all the human Race will remain in Oppo&s;ition to God, under the Power of Sin and Death while God him&s;elf endures?</P>
<P>Either God created his Creatures to be mi&s;erable to all Eternity; or will be fru&s;trated eternally in his De&s;igns; or all mu&s;t be at la&s;t re&s;tored, and made happy by Love, and free Love.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is bla&s;phemous, the &s;econd is di&s;honorable to God; therefore the third mu&s;t be true: for a fourth Conclu|&s;ion cannot be thought upon.</P>
<P>A fourth Objection is taken from the Words of our Sa|viour concerning <HI>Judas, Matt.</HI> xxvi. 24. <HI>Mark</HI> xiv. 21.</P>
<P>"The Son of Man indeed goeth as it is written of him; but Wo to that Man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! good were it for that Man if he had never been born."</P>
<P>The Argument from the&s;e Words is framed after this Man|ner:</P>
<P>"If Judas was not to be damned to all Eternity, how could the Saviour &s;ay, Good were it for that Man if he had never been born?"</P>
<P>This is at be&s;t but a weak Argument, however as I never mean to evade any Thing that has a Colour of Rea&s;on, I &s;hall an&s;wer it from the Scriptures of Truth. Note, A Man may have a Being, and be happy, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugh he dies in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Womb, and is never born. &s;ee <HI>Job</HI> ii. 11, 12, 13, 16, 17. &amp;c.</P>
<P>We have a Number of In&s;tances in the Scripture where light Afflictions (compared with the Damnation of Hell) cau&s;|ed ever good Men to wi&s;h they had never been born. <HI>Job</HI> is noted for the mo&s;t patient Man; and yet he not only cur&s;|ed &s;he Day in which he was born, but the Night in which it was &s;aid, "There is a Man Child conceived." And yet great as his Afflictions were, they were trifling to the Torments of the Damned. He wi&s;hes over and over again that he had never been born. Read the whole of the Second Chapter, and &s;ee how far he exceeds the Expre&s;&s;ions of Chri&s;t re&s;pect|ing Judas; al&s;o Chap. x. 18, 19. and if you are not deter|mined to remain ignorant, you will &s;ee that <HI>Job</HI> thought that
<PB N="43" REF="017441_0042_0FA11D9BEC974498">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would have been better, far better, for him if he had never been born; and yet he never had the Damnation of <HI>Judas.</HI></P>
<P>Another In&s;tance is that of the good Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI>; who when he met with a little outward Trouble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aments and &s;ays, "Wo is me, my Mother; that thou ha&s;t borne me a Man of Strife, and a Man of Contention to the whole Earth! I have neither lent on U&s;ury, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Men have lent to me on U&s;ury, <HI>yet</HI> every one of them doth cur&s;e me. Cur&s;ed <HI>be</HI> the Day wherein I was born: let not the Day wherein my Mo|ther bare me be ble&s;&s;ed. Cur&s;ed <HI>be</HI> the Man who brought Tidings to my Father, &s;aying, A Man Child is born unto thee, making him very glad. And let that Man be as the Cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the Cry in the Morning and the Shouting at Noon Tide; becau&s;e he &s;lew me not from the Womb; or that my Mother might have been my Grave, and her Womb <HI>to be</HI> always great <HI>with me.</HI> Wherefore came I forth out of the Womb to &s;ee Labour and Sorrow, that my Days &s;hould be con&s;umed with Shame?" (See <HI>Jer.</HI> xv. 10, and xx. 14, to the End of the Chapter.) Here we may &s;ee by the&s;e two In|&s;tances, that Men of the be&s;t of Characters, when in outward Trouble, &s;aid much more of them&s;elves than our Saviour &s;aid of <HI>Judas</HI>; they cur&s;ed the Day of their Birth, in the bittere&s;t Manner: And <HI>Jeremiah</HI> even cur&s;ed the Man who brought Tidings of the &s;ame to his Father. While <HI>Je&s;us</HI> only &s;aid, "Good were it for that Man if he had never been born." And who does not &s;ee that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;poke with great Propriety, and Compa&s;&s;ion too, concerning <HI>Judas</HI>? Thus Nothing can be concluded from our Saviour's Words, on that melancholy Occa&s;ion, in Favour of endle&s;s Torments.</P>
<P>For who among Men would not chu&s;e rather never to have been born, than to have betrayed the dear Redeemer? And if both <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> wi&s;hed they had never been born, becau&s;e they met with a little Sorrow and Trouble, with how much greater Propriety did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;peak when he &s;aid, "Good were it for that Man if he had never been born!"</P>
<P>But I am aware that &s;ome will &s;ay, "Though <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> cur&s;ed the Days of their Birth, yet that is no real Proof that any Thing le&s;s than Damnation without End is a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for any to choo&s;e rather never to have been born than to &s;uffer it; and though they in their Anger &s;aid, they would they had died in the Womb, yet that an untimely Birth upon the whole cannot be preferable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o any State ex|cept that of endle&s;s Mi&s;ery." To which I an&s;wer, <HI>Solomon,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="017441_0043_0FA11D9C72393D20">
the wi&s;e&s;t of Mortals, and one under the immediate In&s;pira|tion of the Holy Gho&s;t, was of a very different Mind, for he &s;ays, <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes,</HI> vi. 3&mdash;6, "If a Man beget an hundred <HI>Chil|dren,</HI> and live many Years, &s;o that the Days of his Years be many, and his Soul be not filled with Good, and al&s;o <HI>that</HI> he have no Burial; I &s;ay <HI>that</HI> an untimely Birth <HI>is</HI> better than he: For he (the untimely Birth) cometh in with Vanity, and departeth in Darkne&s;s, and his Name &s;hall be covered with Darkne&s;s. Moreover he hath not &s;een the Sun, nor known <HI>any Thing</HI>: this hath more Re&s;t than the other. Yea though he live a thou&s;and Years twice <HI>told,</HI> yet hath he &s;een no Good."</P>
<P>Here is a State infinitely better than that of Hell Tor|ments (though limited by certain Periods) to which an un|timely Birth is preferred.</P>
<P>Here it is &s;uppo&s;ed, nay affirmed, that if a Man lived two thou&s;and Years, and begat an hundred Children, and yet had not his Soul filled with Good, and e&s;pecially had no Honor in his Death, being denied a Burial, that it would have been better for him never t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have been born. From this it appears as plain as po&s;&s;ible, that a State far happier than endle&s;s (or even limited) Damnation is wor&s;e than not to be born at all. So had <HI>Judas</HI> never been born, he would have been at Re&s;t; even with Kings and Coun&s;ellors of the Earth, &amp;c. where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and where the weary are at Re&s;t. See <HI>Job,</HI> ii. 13, 14, 17.</P>

<P>The next Objection is taken from the Words of <HI>Chri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "Mark</HI> ix. 43&mdash;49. And if thy Hand offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into Life maimed, than having two Hands to go into Hell, into the Fire that never &s;hall be quenched: Where their Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched."</P>
<P>"And if thy Foot offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter halt into Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">han having two Feet to be ca&s;t into Hell, into the Fire that never &s;hall be quenched: Where their Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.

See al&s;o <HI>Matt.</HI> v. 29, 30. xviii. 8, 9. <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> lxvi. 24.</P>
<P>The Objection from the&s;e Words is thus formed, "If the

Worm dieth not, and the Fire be never quenched, then the Mi&s;ery of the Wicked &s;hall endure to all Eternity." To which I an&s;wer, that the Expre&s;&s;ions of the Fire that never &s;hall be quenched, &s;uppo&s;e that it burns perpetually, without Intermi&s;&s;ion, or Ce&s;&s;ation, the whole of the Age or Period for which it la&s;ts, or until it has con&s;umed all that is in Op|po&s;ition to it, but by no Means to all Eternity; &s;ince there may be produced a Number of Texts where the &s;ame Expre&s;|&s;ions are u&s;ed of Fires that have gone out long ago. And indeed the very Nature of Things teaches, that Fire can give Pain no longer than it meets with Contrariety, nor burn any more when all Combu&s;tibles are con&s;umed. So that when the&s;e Words occur, "the Fire &s;hall never be quenched" we may under&s;tand, that it cea&s;es not during the Period a&s;&s;igned for it, or that it &s;hall accompli&s;h the De&s;ign for which it is kindled. Thus we read in <HI>Lev.</HI> vi. 13. "The Fire &s;hall ever be burning upon the Altar: it &s;hall never go out." Now this is expre&s;&s;ed much &s;tronger than though it had been &s;aid, "It never &s;hall be quenched," for it is declared," it ne|ver &s;hall go out." Yet will any one &s;ay that it is burning &s;till, when the Altar and Sacrifices are long ago aboli&s;hed? Or can we &s;uppo&s;e that God meant to command the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to keep the Fire burning on the Altar to all Eternity, or only while the ceremonial Di&s;pen&s;ation la&s;ted?</P>

<P>If this De&s;cription be carefully attended to, I think it will evidently appear, that the&s;e are &s;uch as are redeemed, not from the Earth, nor from among Men, but from the Pit wherein is no Water, not even one Drop to cool the Tongue withal.

<P>Another Objection is taken from our Saviour's Words to the <HI>Jews, John</HI> vii. 34, and viii. 21. "Ye &s;hall &s;eek me, and &s;hall not find <HI>me</HI>: and where I am <HI>thither</HI> ye can|not come.&mdash;Then &s;aid <HI>Je&s;us</HI> again unto them, I go my Way, and ye &s;hall &s;eek m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;hall die in your Sins: whi|ther I go, ye cannot come."</P>
<P>I have heard this u&s;ed as an unan&s;werable Objection, but let it be remembered, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> u&s;ed the &s;ame Words to his Apo&s;tles as he did to the <HI>Jews</HI>; and certainly meant the &s;ame Thing, viz. That neither could the <HI>Jews,</HI> nor the Di&s;ciples at that Time nor till they were prepared, go where <HI>Je&s;us</HI> went. See Chap. xiii. 33. "Little Children, yet a little While I am with you. Ye &s;hall &s;eek me: and as I &s;aid unto the <HI>Jews,</HI> Whi|ther I go ye cannot come, &s;o now I &s;ay unto you." You may ob&s;erve that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> refers to the very Words which he &s;aid to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and then began a different Di&s;cour&s;e; neither does it appear that he would have given any Explanation of his Words, had not <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid, "Lord, whither goe&s;t thou? <HI>Je&s;us</HI> an&s;wered him, Whither I go thou can&s;t not follow me now: but thou &s;halt follow me afterwards." ver. 36. And the &s;ame will fully explain <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Words to the <HI>Jews</HI>; they &s;hall &s;ee him again, but not '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill they &s;hall &s;ay, Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>is</HI> he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.' <HI>Matt.</HI> xxiii. 39. <HI>Luke</HI> xiii. 35. No more need be added upon this.</P>
<P>Another Objection (though a very &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght one) is taken from <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> ix. 10. "What&s;oever thy Hand findeth to do, do <HI>it</HI> with thy M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: for <HI>there is</HI> no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wi&s;dom, in the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave whither thou goe&s;t." To which &s;ome add, "There is no Repentance in the Grave." A Pa&s;&s;age no where to be found to the Bible, and which, if it could be found, would be Nothing to the Purpo&s;e. If the
<PB N="48" REF="017441_0047_0FA11D9F71D5D7D0">
Text quoted proves any Thing again&s;t the Re&s;toration, it proves as much again&s;t the Immortality of the Soul; for if there is "no Knowledge, nor Wi&s;dom," among the Souls departed, there can neither be Happine&s;s nor Mi&s;ery; and con&s;equently the Soul dies with the Body.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> al&s;o &s;ays (Ver. 5. of this &s;ame Chapter) "The Dead know not any Thing; neither have they any more a Reward; for the Memory of them is forgotten." What Work &s;hould we be obliged to make of the Re&s;t of the Bible, if we were to explain this of the State of Souls departed? We mu&s;t deny their Sen&s;ibility, and all Rewards, and Pu|ni&s;hments, as well as the Day of Judgment. But explain it of the State of the Body, and all appears ea&s;y; and then it will be manife&s;t, that it militates nothing again&s;t the Re&s;to|ration.</P>
<P>Another Objection (&s;till weaker than the former) is taken from chap. xi. 3, "And if the Tree fall toward the South, or toward the North; in the Place where the Tree falleth, there it &s;hall be."</P>
<P>To which many add "As Death leaves, &s;o Judgement finds." A Sentence not to be found in all the &s;acred Writings, and if the&s;e Words were to be found, they would prove No|thing again&s;t the Re&s;toration. It is indeed very &s;urpri&s;ing that People will hang on &s;uch &s;lender Things! I have heard People as po&s;itive as of their Being that they could find the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions in the Word of God, "There is no Repentance in the Grave; as Death leaves us, &s;o Judgment will find us:" and many other Pa&s;&s;ages which cannot be found, and if they could, would not an&s;wer their Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>As for that Text, "And if the Tree fall, &amp;c." it belongs not at all to the Matter in Hand, neither one Way nor the other; but if it did, it would be &s;o far from being a Proof again&s;t the Re&s;toration, that it would be in Favour of it; for a Tree lies not long as it falls; but is either cut up and framed for U&s;e, or burned in the Fire, and turned again to the Ele|ments whence it &s;prung, or &s;oon moulders away, and comes to its fir&s;t Matter again, and will, with the Re&s;t of the Earth be brought back into the cry&s;tal Sea before the Throne. I &s;hould not have &s;aid &s;o much upon the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, as they are nothing to the Purpo&s;e, if they were not continu|ally urged as Objections to the Re&s;toration; though without any Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Another (and &s;omething of a plau&s;ible) Objection is taken from <HI>Job.</HI> xxxvi. 18, "Becau&s;e <HI>there is</HI> Wrath, <HI>beware</HI> le&s;t he take thee away with his Stroke; then a great Ran&s;om can|not deliver thee."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="017441_0048_0FA11DA031CA75C0">But &s;urely the Objectors do not mean by this to in&s;inuate that the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood of the Saviour, that precious Blood, is not able to deliver Souls out of Hell: Since we read, <HI>Zech.</HI> ix. 11. "As for thee al&s;o, by the Blood of the Covenant I have &s;ent forth thy Pri&s;oners out of the Pit wherein <HI>is</HI> no Water." We believe that the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is able to &s;ave to the utter|mo&s;t; and is &s;trong enough to break the Power of Sin, Death, and Hell.</P>
<P>By the Ran&s;om &s;poken of in the Text, we may under&s;tand Strength, Riches, Wi&s;dom, &amp;c. as it is explained in the 19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Ver&s;e; "Will he e&s;teem thy Riches? <HI>No,</HI> not Gold not all the Forces of Strength." As al&s;o in P&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m xlix. 6, 7, 8, 9.

That he &s;hould &s;till live for ever, <HI>and</HI> &s;ee Corrup|tion." From all which, carefully compared with the Re&s;t of Scripture, we find the meaning of the Words to be, that a great Sum, or Ran&s;om, cannot deliver from the Stroke of Death. This we know to be true; but nothing in this Pa&s;|&s;age tends to depreciate the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> nor to &s;how that it cannot be effectual to lo&s;t Souls.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of the rich Man is frequently brought to prove that Mi&s;ery will endure to all Eternity. It is &s;aid by &s;ome, that "as he was denied a Drop of Water, it cannot be ex|pected that his Sufferings will ever have an End." To this it may be an&s;wered, that it was nece&s;&s;ary and right that he &s;hould have "Judgment without Mercy, who &s;hewed no Mer|cy, <HI>James</HI> ii. 13." and be deprived of every Sen&s;e of Com|fort, in Order that be might come to feel his Mi&s;ery, and &s;ubmit to the Saviour: but Nothing can be concluded from hence again&s;t the Re&s;toration, &s;ince it is &s;aid, <HI>Zech.</HI> iv. 11, "As for thee al&s;o, by the Blood of thy Covenant I have &s;ent forth thy Pri&s;oners out of the Pit wherein <HI>is</HI> no Water."</P>
<P>Now there cannot be &s;uch a Place in this Life or World; there is always &s;ome Cordial in the mo&s;t bitter Cup; therefore the Pit where no Water is, mu&s;t be Hell it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;t</HI> calls Hell "A Furnace of Fire," <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii. 42, 50. Golden Ore is thrown into the Furnace to be melted, and refined, not de&s;troyed or annihilated; as it is ca&s;t there to be purified by Fire, it is well known that no Water mu&s;t come to it during the Sea&s;on of its Refinement, even though it &s;hould be intended finally to make Ve&s;&s;els to hold Water; for if one was to quench or mitigate the Fire, it would tend to

fru&s;trate the Intention of the &s;ame, which is to purge the Gold from the Dro&s;s; which when it is once done, the Fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th no Power over it at all; it can never lo&s;e any Thing more.</P>
<P>The m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t plau&s;ible Objection in the In&s;tance of the rich Man is taken from tho&s;e Words, <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 26, "And be|fines all this, between us and you there is a great Gulph fixed; &s;o that they which would pa&s;s from hence to you can|not: neither can they pa&s;s to us that <HI>would come</HI> from thence."</P>
<P>This Gulph is Sin, or the Want of the New Birth, without which no Man can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. It is evident therefore that there was a whole Birth between them, and as it is impo&s;&s;ible for any to go into Mi&s;ery or Pain that are perfectly holy, &s;o al&s;o for any to enter into Happine&s;s un|til they are free from Sin, and become as pure as Light it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>This concludes Nothing again&s;t the final Re&s;toration, but &s;hews it mu&s;t be effected by a new Birth of the divine Life produced in every one.</P>
<P>The rich Man &s;eems not to have lo&s;t the Spark of the di|vine Life, nor the immortal Seed, &s;ince he earne&s;tly de&s;ired that "his Brethren might not come into the Place of Torment where he was." This &s;hows him not to have been &s;o lo&s;t to Virtue as Satan, &s;ince the Devil and his Angels, though mi|&s;erable them&s;elves, &s;eek to make all Men &s;o too, notwith|&s;tanding it increa&s;es their Torment. Add to all this, that <HI>Abraham</HI> calls the rich Man "Son," and puts him in Mind of the Difference between him and <HI>Lazarus</HI> in their Lives, and the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the pre&s;ent different States they were in, and I think it will appear that Nothing can be concluded from his Ca&s;e in Favour of Damnation without End. For in Ca&s;e that he was to be puni&s;hed to all eternal Ages, there could be no Kind of Proportion between the Suf|ferings, Torments, and evil Things of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> and tho&s;e Things which he endured; whereas it is intimated, that all are dete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mined by exact Weight, Number, and Mea&s;ure. Let us hear what our Lord &s;ays on this Matter, <HI>Luke</HI> xii. 47, 48. "And that Servant which knew his Lord's Will, and prepar|ed not <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> neither did according to his Will, &s;hall be beat|en with MANY <HI>Stripes.</HI> But he that knew not, and did commit Things wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y of Stripes, &s;hall be beaten with FEW." But what Difference &s;o much to be noticed could there be, if both were to be beaten to all Eternity? Or how could either be &s;aid to have FEW, if there was never to be an End? Impo&s;&s;ible! <HI>Rev.</HI> xviii. 7. "How much &s;he (Ba|bylon)

hath glorified her&s;elf, and lived deliciou&s;ly, &s;o much Torment and Sorrow give her." All here appears equal and ju&s;t; but to &s;uppo&s;e a poor ignorant Heathen, or a Child of fourteen, dying in his Sins, will be in Mi&s;ery as long as the mo&s;t wicked per&s;ecuting Tyrant, or Apo&s;tate <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> contradicts all the Ideas we have of Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s, or Equity; and tends directly to Infidelity. For who can &s;up|po&s;e, in this Ca&s;e, that every Man is rewarded according to his Works?</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Matt.</HI> xix. 24, <HI>Mark</HI> x. 25, <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 25, "It is ea&s;ier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle than for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God."</P>
<P>This implies the greate&s;t Difficulty imaginable, nay with Men an utter Impo&s;&s;ibility; yet we are expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ured "it is po&s;&s;ible with God, to whom all Things are po&s;&s;ible." Now did any of us ever know a Man that pa&s;&s;ed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough greater Difficulty here than it would be for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle? Which yet a rich Man mu&s;t pa&s;s through before be can enter into the Kingdom of God. He is therefore made to pa&s;s through it, either here, or hereafter; and this, though impo&s;&s;ible to Men, is po&s;&s;ible with God. Thus though it was as impo&s;&s;ible for the rich Man to pa&s;s from Pain to Bli&s;s, from Torment to Paradi&s;e, as for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle, yet it is by no Means im|po&s;&s;ible for God to deliver him, and make good that Promi&s;e to him in due Time; "I will give unto him that is athir&s;t of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely." <HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 6.</P>
<P>Then, when he and tho&s;e like him "come out of great Tribulation," even the &s;econd Death, "they &s;hall hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more:&mdash;For the Lamb which is in the Mid&s;t of the Throne &s;hall feed them, and &s;hall lead them unto living Fountains of Waters: and God &s;hall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes." <HI>Rev.</HI> vii 14, 16, 17.</P>
<P>When Sin is de&s;troyed, the Gulph &s;hall be no more; &s;o while the Gulph remains it is impa&s;&s;ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; that is, while any continue in their Sins, and in Oppo&s;ition to God, there can be no Connection between the ble&s;&s;ed Spirits and them; but Sin cannot remain to all Eternity; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will at la&s;t "draw all unto him; Death &s;hall be de&s;troyed;" and then certainly Sin, which is the "Sting of Death," &s;hall have no more a Being in any of the Creatures of God.</P>
<P>Another Objection is taken from tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, where God is repre&s;ented as &s;wearing in his Wrath, that the Unbelievers &s;hall not enter into his Re&s;t. Such as <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xcv.

<P>By the Re&s;t that was promi&s;ed to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which they forfeited by their Unbelief, we mu&s;t under&s;tand the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and not future Happine&s;s. For who can &s;uppo&s;e that out of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Men, be&s;ides Women, only two entered into Paradi&s;e at Death! Then, were but two who entered into <HI>Canaan, Caleb</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> who fallowed the Lord fully: and even <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> were denied that Favour; but who will &s;uppo&s;e that they did not enter into Paradi&s;e? The Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was a Type of the milennial Kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in which they who are Over-comers &s;hall reign with him on his Throne. "There re|maineth therefore a Re&s;t (or keeping of Sabbath) to the Peo|ple of God." <HI>Heb.</HI> iv. 9. This Sabbath (pointed out by the &s;eventh Day Sabbath) intends the "thou&s;and Years that <HI>Satan</HI> &s;hall be bound, and the Kingdoms of the World &s;hall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his <HI>Chri&s;t."</HI> Into this Kingdom none &s;hall enter who are fearful, and unbelieving; but &s;uch as follow the Lord fully.</P>
<P>But as this Matter is very plain, I &s;hall not add any more at pre&s;ent upon it.</P>
<P>Another Objection is taken from our Saviour's Words <HI>John</HI> ix. 4. "I mu&s;t work the Works of him that &s;ent me while it is Day: the Night cometh when no Man can work."</P>
<P>But I cannot &s;ee how this affects the Controver&s;y at all, and without it can be &s;hown wherein it is to the Purpo&s;e, no An|&s;wer need be given. It is readily granted, that Bodies in the Grave are incapable of Action; but this by no Means affects the State of Souls departed, who are capable of Thought, Volition and Action. None can &s;uppo&s;e our Saviour's Soul lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s while his Body was dead; but this mu&s;t be pro|ved, before the Pa&s;&s;age will appear to be any Thing to the Purpo&s;e it is brought for.</P>
<P>It is certain that there are many Works which we may do while we live, that we cannot after Death; &s;uch as feeding the Hungry, clothing the Naked, relieving the Poor, Strangers, Fatherle&s;s, Widows, &amp;c. Wherefore <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes</HI> ix. 10, "What&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever thine Pland fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th to do, do <HI>it</HI> with thy Might: for <HI>there is</HI> no Work nor Device, nor Know|ledge, nor Wi&s;dom, in the Grave whither thou goe&s;t." This is certain, and points out the Condition of dead Bodies, but militates nothing again&s;t the Re&s;toration of lo&s;t Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, nor the Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</P>
<P>It is in&s;inuated by &s;ome, that this Doctrine is the &s;ame that
<PB N="53" REF="017441_0052_0FA11DA3F1F667C0">
<HI>Satan</HI> taught <HI>Eve, Gen.</HI> iii. 4. "And the Serpent &s;aid unto the Woman, ye &s;hall not &s;urely die." I can hardly think that tho&s;e who make this Objection think it is any Thing to the Purpo&s;e. All who have ever examined our Principles, or the Sentiments of the My&s;tic Writers, know that we hold, that Death came immediately upon our fir&s;t Parents, when they eat of the forbidden Fruit, as the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of Sin. It came in&s;tantly, not nine hundred Years afterwards, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, and thereby in Part approve of the Serpent's Words, &s;ince they hold they did not die exactly according to the Word of God, on the &s;ame Day that they &s;inned.</P>
<P>The Death they died con&s;i&s;ted in a total Lo&s;s of the Life of God, the divine Image; or the whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Garment. They awakened the animal Life in them&s;elves, which is their State of Death, and Corruption. From this mi&s;erable E&s;tate we be|lieve <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> came to redeem us, and all Mankind. Accord|ing to the following Scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Rom.</HI> v. 18. "Therefore as by the Offence of one, <HI>Judge|ment came</HI> upon all Men to Condemnation, even &s;o by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, <HI>the free Gift came</HI> upon all Men unto Ju&s;tification of Life. V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e 20. Where Sin abounded, Grace did much more abound. 21. That as Sin hath reigned unto Death, even &s;o might Grace reign through Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal Life, by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord."</P>
<P>I. <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 22. "For as in <HI>Adam</HI> all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive." Some will &s;ay that this intends on|ly a Re&s;urrection of Bodies; but remember, that we died a Death of Souls in <HI>Adam</HI>; and mu&s;t therefore have a &s;piri|tual Life in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or there is no Likene&s;s at all between what we lo&s;t in one, and gain in the other. And it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that both Expre&s;&s;ions are alike univer&s;al, and certain. As &s;ure as all die in <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o &s;ure &s;hall all be made alive in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Other Texts might be added, but the&s;e are &s;ufficient. Now judge if the glorious Doctrine of the Re&s;toration is the &s;ame, or any Thing like <HI>that</HI> which the Serpent preached to <HI>Eve.</HI></P>
<P>"The Serpent &s;aid, Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die." But we &s;ay that all have died, and that Death is the con&s;tant Attendant of Sin, and mu&s;t abide while Sin remains. "For the Soul that &s;inneth &s;hall" as &s;urely "die," as a Man that breaks his Bones &s;hall feel Pain: but we declare al&s;o, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will de&s;troy Sin, Death, Hell and the Grave, and rai&s;e up the whole Creation into its primeval State of Glory: According to the&s;e Scriptures following; <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xxv. 8. <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> xiii. 14.

8. <HI>Rev.</HI> v. 13. xxi. 4, 5. and many other Pa&s;&s;ages. The Serpent contradicted the Word of God, in &s;aving, "Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die," &s;o do tho&s;e equally contradict it, who &s;ay, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will never "&s;wallow up Death in Victory," will never "ran&s;om" his Creatures from its "Power," nor "redeem them from Hell;" will never "de&s;troy the Works of the Devil." nor "make all Things new." Now let the candid unbia&s;&s;ed Reader judge who mo&s;t imitates the Ser|pent, tho&s;e who believe and teach that all the Promi&s;es of God &s;hall be fulfilled as they are &s;poken; or tho&s;e who ex|plain away almo&s;t all their apparent Meaning!</P>
<P>I have heard it boldly a&s;&s;erted, that the Doctrine of the Re&s;toration could not be true, becau&s;e the Scripture in vari|ous Places declares, that "The Expectation and Hope of the Wicked &s;hall peri&s;h." See <HI>Proverbs</HI> x. 28. xi. 7. <HI>Job</HI> viii. 13, 14. xi 20. xviii. 14. xxvii. 8. Now it &s;hould be enquired what their Hope and Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctation i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? The Scripture &s;aith <HI>Prov.</HI> xi. 23. "The Expectation of the wicked <HI>is</HI> Wrath." And i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wrath peri&s;hes, Mi&s;ery mu&s;t end. If it is &s;aid, The wicked hope to go to Heaven in their Sins; it may be an&s;wered, that all &s;uch Hopes mu&s;t peri&s;h before they can be re&s;tored. And will be rejected, that have not a Wedding Garment; Nothing can enter into the Kingdom till it is pure, without Spot or Wrinkle, or any &s;uch Thing.</P>
<P>If the Hopes of the Wicked are bad, and &s;inful; then they mu&s;t peri&s;h, before any Good can come to them. Even a Soul in this World, under the Operation of the Spirit of God, mu&s;t have all his fal&s;e Hopes peri&s;h, and be taken away, his vain Confidence entirely o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oyed, before he can be tru|ly builded upon the Rock of Ages. So that the Hope of the Wicked being de&s;troyed, is &s;o far from being again&s;t their Re|&s;toration, that it makes greatly in Favor of it; &s;ince without the De&s;truction of every Thing that is evil, the Good can never perfectly prevail.</P>
<P>We readily allow, that all the Wicked (as well as their Hopes, De&s;ires, Thoughts, Ways, and Expectations) &s;hall peri&s;h; but this is no Argument at all again&s;t their Re&s;tora|tion, but the very Way to bring it about.</P>
<P>We read in <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lvii. 1. "The Righteous peri&s;heth," and in <HI>Micah</HI> vii. 2. "The good <HI>Man</HI> is peri&s;hed out of the Earth:" yet the&s;e Scriptures will by no Means prove that they are lo&s;t, &s;ince other Pa&s;&s;ages a&s;&s;ure us, that they &s;hall be rai&s;ed up again.</P>
<P>In the fourteenth Chap. of <HI>Job,</HI> we find the Ca&s;e of Man cut down by Death, repre&s;ented as more helple&s;s than that
<PB N="55" REF="017441_0054_0FA11DA57295CC70">
of a Tree cut down; yet who would u&s;e it as an Argument again&s;t the Re&s;urrection, and future State? which Truths are declared in many other Places. So though great Numbers of Scriptures intimate that De&s;truction &s;hall come to the Wicked; yet many others declare that all &s;hall finally &s;ub|mit, and be re&s;tored. Now all the&s;e are true, all mu&s;t be ac|compli&s;hed: Therefore their De&s;truction, and Re&s;toration, are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with each other. Their De&s;truction is wholly from them&s;elves, and Sin, but their Re&s;toration, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, is entirely from God, by free Grace, through the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of this Objection which I have ju&s;t an&s;wered, once &s;aid in my hearing, "If it were not for Hopes the Heart would break; and as &s;oon as all Hopes are gone, the Heart breaks at once." This is true; then it is no Matter how &s;oon the Hopes of the Wicked peri&s;h, in order that their &s;tubborn Hearts may break. When that is once the ca&s;e, then they will find, that, "The Sacrifices of God <HI>are</HI> a broken Spirit: a broken and contrite Heart God will not de&s;pi&s;e. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> li. 17. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lvii. 15. and lxvi. 2.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this An&s;wer, with the Words of the proud|e&s;t M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">narch that ever lived; &s;poken after he was humbled, "Tho&s;e that wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k in Pride he is able to aba&s;e." <HI>Dan.</HI> iv. 37.</P>
<P>It is frequently urged as an unan&s;werable Objection again&s;t the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctrine of Univer&s;al Re&s;toration, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did not pray for all, and therefore did not die for all, and of Con&s;equence all &s;hall never be re&s;tored. This is taken from <HI>John</HI> xvii. 9. "I pray for them: I pray not for the World, but for them which thou ha&s;t given me, for they are thine." In the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t Part of the Chapter, from the 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h to the 20th Ver&s;e, it is evident that our Lord prays for his cho&s;en Di&s;ci|ples or Apo&s;tles, and for them only, as will appear to any one who reads with Attention; but in the 20<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Ver&s;e he ex|tends much further in the&s;e Words, "Neither pray I for the&s;e alone, but for them al&s;o which &s;hall believe on me through their Word."</P>
<P>Now it is evident, that our Lord did not pray for all in the ninth Ver&s;e for whom he died; for had that been the Ca&s;e, he would not have enlarged his Prayer in the twentieth Ver&s;e, which he has done; and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he 21&s;t and 23d Ver&s;es, he has prayed for the whole World, that the whole World might have that Faith and Knowledge which is Life eternal; Ver&s;e 3, "And this is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent." He prays, "That they all way be one, as thou, Father, <HI>art</HI> in
<PB N="56" REF="017441_0055_0FA11DA7492DB758">
me&punc; and I in thee, that they al&s;o may be one in us; that the WORLD may BELIEVE that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the WORLD may KNOW that thou ha&s;t &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt me, and ha&s;t loved them as thou ha&s;t loved me." Here the ultimate De&s;ign of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s praying for the Unity of the true Believers &s;eems to be the Salvation of the World. So that it is evident enough that Nothing can be concluded from this Chapter, or Prayer, again&s;t the Re&s;toration; but much is here &s;aid in its Favour, as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has evidently prayed for all.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, for his Apo&s;tles, Ver&s;e 9 to 20 Secondly, for them al&s;o that &s;hould believe on him through their Word, Ver. 20. Thirdly, for the World in general, Ver&s;es 21 and 23. This is a &s;ufficient An&s;wer.</P>
<P>I have heard two contrary Extremes given as the Meaning of the ninth Ver&s;e, both equally contrary to Sen&s;e, Rea&s;on, and Scripture. The fir&s;t is, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> prayed for all that ever &s;hall be &s;aved in tho&s;e Words; "I pray for them: I pray not for the World, but for them which thou ha&s;t given me, &amp;c." Now if the whole for whom the Saviour died were intended in that Ver&s;e, why did he &s;ay, "Nei her pray I for the&s;e alone, but for them al&s;o which &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l believe on me through their Word? And that the World may know that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me?"</P>
<P>The other non&s;en&s;ical Opinion that I have heard advanced, is, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> prayed in the ninth Ver&s;e for the whole World of Men, but not for the Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of Sin. But according to that Notion, he prayed in the twentieth Ver&s;e not only for all Men, but for all Sin that &s;hould believe on him through the Word of all Men; and finally for all the World of Sin; that it might come to know and believe that GOD had &s;ent <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It has been objected by &s;ome, that as the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. 11, "He that is unju&s;t, let him be unju&s;t &s;till; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy &s;till;" there never can be an Univer&s;al Re&s;toration, nor any Alteration in the States of tho&s;e who &s;hall be found in their Sins, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall come to judge the World. This is thought to be the &s;tronger, as it is found in the la&s;t Chapter of the <HI>Rev.</HI> and is &s;oon after followed by a De&s;cription of tho&s;e that &s;hall have no Part in the holy City. Ver&s;e 15th. "For without <HI>are</HI> Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murder|ers, and Idolaters, and who&s;oever loveth and maketh a Lye."</P>
<P>Chap. xxi. 8. "But the Fearful and Unbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sor|cerers,
<PB N="57" REF="017441_0056_0FA11DA7B1E302E8">
and Idolaters, and all Lyars &s;hall have their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone: which is the &s;econd Death."</P>
<P>Nothing unclean can enter into the holy City. "And there &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into it any Thing that defileth, neither <HI>what&s;oever</HI> worketh Abomination, or <HI>maketh</HI> a Lye: but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life." Ver&s;e 27.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e that are found unju&s;t, and filthy, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall come, cannot enter into his Kingdom, they mu&s;t have their Part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone; their Portion mu&s;t be with Unbelievers, where there is Weep|ing, and Gna&s;hing of Teeth: they mu&s;t be filthy, and unju&s;t &s;till, notwith&s;tanding <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Coming; i. e. they mu&s;t re|main &s;o, till they are purified by gradual Proce&s;&s;es; for No|thing of this Kind is performed in an arbitrary Manner.</P>
<P>But this can by no means intend that they &s;hall remain <HI>un|ju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>filthy</HI> to all Eternity; &s;ince that would contradict many plain Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, and defeat God's De&s;ign of making "all Things new." All therefore that can be fairly drawn from the Text is, that many &s;hall be found <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>filthy</HI> when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall come, and &s;hall remain &s;o, and not be immediately clean&s;ed. Too many vainly imagine, that tho' they live in wilful Sins, yet when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall come, whether by Death, or Judgment, they &s;hall be in&s;tantly clean&s;ed.</P>
<P>But &s;uch will find their great Mi&s;take; they will find the Truth of the&s;e Words. "He that is unju&s;t, let him be un|ju&s;t &s;till; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy &s;till;" to their Sorrow. Wherefore it behoves all to &s;eek here in this Life for a true Clean&s;ing in the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; and not dare to live in Sin, as many do, and vainly hope for an in|&s;tantaneous Sanctification in the la&s;t Moments of Life; for no &s;uch is to be expected.</P>
<P>As for this Pa&s;&s;age being the greater Objection, on the Ac|count of it's &s;tanding in the la&s;t Chapter of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> I &s;ee no Force at all in that, as the Scripture is not written in the Form of a Sy&s;tem, but the &s;everal Truths of the Go&s;pel are di&s;per&s;ed about through the Whole. But if any will con|tend for the Order in this Chapter, they may find an Invita|tion, given in the mo&s;t free and univer&s;al Manner, without any Exception, in the 17 Ver&s;e, in the&s;e Words, "And let him that is athir&s;t, come; and who&s;oever will, let him take the Water of Life freely."</P>
<P>None can be ever happy till they have a De&s;ire after the
<PB N="58" REF="017441_0057_0FA11DA8718F83E8">
Fountain of Life; and whenever this is the Ca&s;e, they &s;hall be admitted to it freely.</P>
<P>The Bible ends with a Ble&s;&s;ing, after all the Cur&s;es; "The Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>be</HI> with you all. A|men.</P>
<P>As <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is Alpha, &s;o will he be Omega. He is the Be|ginning, and he will be the End; He is the Fir&s;t, and he will be the La&s;t. See <HI>Rev.</HI> i. 8, 11. xxi. 6. xxii. 13.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t reign till all his Foes are conquered, till all &s;hall own him Lord, and all become his willing and obedient Subjects; then (and not till then) &s;hall he deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, and be &s;ubject to him, that put all Things under him, that God may be ALL IN ALL.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured (I tru&s;t) in the Spirit of Meek|ne&s;s, to an&s;wer all the Objections u&s;ually brought from the Scripture again&s;t the Re&s;toration of all Things. How well I have &s;ucceeded, I leave to the Reader to judge.</P>
<P>I have aimed at the Glory of God, and the Welfare of Mankind; and I tru&s;t, this Te&s;timony of my Con&s;cience will &s;upport me, under all the Reproach, Oppo&s;ition, and Contempt, I may meet with on the Account of my Senti|ments.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude all with the following Lines, taken from Mr. Pope's univer&s;al Prayer,
<Q><L>If I am right, thy Grace impart,</L>
<L>Still in the Right to &s;tay;</L>
<L>If I am wrong, oh teach my Heart</L>
<L>To find that better Way!</L></Q></P>
