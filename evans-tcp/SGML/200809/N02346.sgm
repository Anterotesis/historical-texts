<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>IT is matter of &s;orrowful, Ob&s;ervation, That <HI>New-England's</HI> primitive Ways are not now &s;een among us in their former Glory and Beauty; but we have too &s;adly <HI>left our fir&s;t Love</HI>: and Cu&s;toms, of ill fame, very in|con&s;i&s;tent with that Profe&s;&s;ion we make of the pure&s;t Reformation, are vi&s;ibly &s;preading in the mid&s;t of us.</P>
<P>IN particular, it is for a Lamentation, that many Per&s;ons do unnece&s;&s;arily frequent <HI>Taverns</HI> and <HI>Publick Hou&s;es</HI>; even to a Scan|dal, and to the manife&s;t Prejudice and Hin|drance of all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="002780_0004_0FE6325CAB1E1DD0">WE do therefore hold our &s;elves oblig'd, in faithfulne&s;s to our great Lord &amp; Ma&s;ter, the Credit of the Go&s;pel, and the Welfare of precious Souls, to joyn in the following <HI>Serious Addre&s;s</HI> to our Neighbours. Which, &s;ome of us having had the Compo&s;ing, and others the Peru&s;al of, we all concur to the Scope &amp; Sub&s;tance; as apprehending it to be a &s;ea&s;onable and needful Te&s;timony: And do earne&s;tly (in the Meekne&s;s of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> and yet with his Authority) exhort all into who&s;e hands it may come, <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> particularly who are under our more immediate In&s;pection and Charge, (for who&s;e Souls we would watch as they that mu&s;t give Account; that we may do it with Joy, and not with Grief; for that is unprofitable for them) to take what is here offer'd, into their mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration, and to &s;ubmit their Con&s;ci|ences unto the Mind and Will of GOD, as it is herein pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P>THE Addre&s;s is made in this mo&s;t publick manner; Partly becau&s;e if there be any &s;o <HI>&s;ecret</HI> in their practice of the Evil witne&s;s'd again&s;t, as to e&s;cape our Notice and per&s;onal Applications, we hope this Admonition by the way of the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> may find them out: Partly al&s;o that tho&s;e upon whom a tran&s;ient oral Di&s;cour&s;e is apt to make but little Im|pre&s;&s;ion, may by having a <HI>printed</HI> one in their

hands, have opportunity more <HI>deliberately</HI> to weigh our Advice: And partly that we might in this way <HI>reach</HI> tho&s;e whom we can't &s;peak to from the <HI>Pulpit.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Admonition is primarily intended for <HI>Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors,</HI> of whom we wou'd hope that &s;ome are among the Faithful in CHRIST; who will be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay with the Royal P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Let the Righteous &s;mite me, it &s;hall be a Kindne&s;s</HI> &mdash;. And as Brethren, we wou'd re&s;tore &s;uch in the &s;pirit of <HI>meekne&s;s,</HI> con&s;idering our &s;elves as Men &s;ubject to like pa&s;&s;ions with others. Yet it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that in the cour&s;e of this Addre&s;s, here and there are mingled &s;ome oc|ca&s;ional Hints, more e&s;pecially pointed at the gro&s;ly <HI>Scandalous,</HI> who de&s;erve to be <HI>&s;harply rebuked,</HI> and often have been.</P>
<P>WE wou'd not be under&s;tood to involve all that are faulty, in one common Charge of Guilt, without di&s;tinction: or to impute every ill property and effect of the Tavern-meetings, in the &s;ame degree, to every one. Nor is it de&s;ign'd to ca&s;t <HI>Reproach</HI> on any par|ticular Per&s;ons; but We &s;incerely aim (by the Grace of GOD) at the Reforming of &s;uch as are fallen into &s;o unhappy a Practice, and the Warning of others who are like to be in|&s;nared.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="002780_0006_0FE6325DB3704A08">WE be&s;eech all concern'd, &s;olemnly to examine them&s;elves, to ponder the path of their feet, and prove their own ways; and make particular application of the Reproofs and Warnings here given, as an inform'd Con&s;cience &s;hall direct: Awfully remembring this matter will quickly be judg'd according to the Go&s;pel, at the enlighten'd Tribunal of CHRIST, <HI>Who&s;e We are, and whom we &s;erve.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is an apprehen&s;ion of Duty, with a Love to your Souls, which en|gages us in the pre&s;ent Te&s;timony again&s;t an evil Practice growing among us,&mdash;The needle&s;s re&s;orting to <HI>Taverns,</HI> and &s;pending much precious Time (particularly the Evening) in <HI>Publick Hou&s;es</HI>: A Practice, which we can't but think is of dangerous Tendency, of a criminal A&s;pect, and of too bad Report for Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion to indulge them&s;elves in; and therefore we cannot but in faithfulne&s;s warn you again&s;t it. Brethren, We are jealous over you with a godly Jealou&s;y; and are afraid le&s;t by any means, as the <HI>Serpent</HI> beguiled <HI>Eve</HI> by his Subtilty, &s;o your minds &s;hould be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in CHRIST; as the Apo&s;tle &s;pake to his Friends at <HI>Corinth,</HI> not in the Language of Prejudice &amp; Di&s;affection, but of his abundant Love and good Will to them. We fear what Mi&s;chiefs &amp; Ruins &s;uch a Practice may bring on many, who&s;e be&s;t Intere&s;ts we are very much concern'd for; if there be not a &s;ea|&s;onable &s;top put unto it.</P>
<P>Therefore we be&s;eech you, Friends, &s;uffer the Exhor|tation, which we now bring you, in the name &amp; fear of GOD&punc; with no other Aim but at his Glory, and
<PB REF="002780_0008_0FE6326183B20798">
your everla&s;ting Good. O that our Coun&s;el may be acceptable to you! We wou'd &s;peak the words of Truth &amp; Soberne&s;s. GOD by his Ble&s;&s;ing make them words of Power; and make us wi&s;e Reprovers upon <HI>obedient Ears!</HI></P>
<P>Come then &amp; let us rea&s;on together. Hear now and con&s;ider, while we plead with you. It is an important ca&s;e we are upon, and we intreat you to allow it an impartial &amp; &s;erious Trial. Will you give us leave to expo&s;tulate the matter with a ju&s;t freedom, and with all plainne&s;s of Speech, under the following particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Are you not chargeable with a very faulty <HI>Mi&s;|pence</HI> of <HI>TIME,</HI> while you go &s;o often, and tarry &s;o long at the Tavern, or other publick Hou&s;es!</P>
<P>Do you not very often &s;pend your long Hours there, without di&s;patching any Bu&s;ine&s;s at all; without doing or getting any real Good, whether as to E&s;tate, Body, or Soul; without &s;erving any of the valuable Ends of the Rational Life, much le&s;s of the Chri&s;tian! Hence, Is it not a &s;ort of more &s;olemn Idlene&s;s you are guilty of! And then, Is it nor an Aggravation, that you &s;pend &s;o <HI>many</HI> Hours in your Tavern-Interviews! The Frequency and Length adds not a little to the Guilt &amp; Mi&s;chief of them, by a dreadful Con&s;umption of precious Time; which is a Talent we mu&s;t all Account for, and being but of &s;hort Continuance, we hadn't need be prodigal of it. Brethren, the Time is &s;hort, and much of it runs off in Sleep, and in nece&s;&s;ary Refre&s;hments, and unavoi|dable Avocations from Bu&s;ine&s;s. In&s;tead therefore of contriving Methods to pa&s;s away the Time which re|mains, you had need &s;tudy all po&s;&s;ible ways to <HI>redeem</HI> it, by doing <HI>with Might</HI> what your hands find to do<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eccl.</HI> 9.10.</NOTE>. O then do not lavi&s;h away any more of your &s;wift and uncertain and irretrievable Hours in Amu&s;ement &amp; Im|pertinence. Carefully gather up the fragments of Time, that nothing be lo&s;t. Talk not of <HI>&s;pare-Hours,</HI> &mdash; that you can afford the Time, or that you take only the <HI>Even|ning</HI> to refre&s;h your &s;elves after the Labours of a weary

They of old imagined a vain thing, who &s;aid<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> 7.10</NOTE>, <HI>We are delivered to do</HI> the&s;e things. Think not to pa&s;s &s;uch Accounts with your righteous Judge in the great Day. Is it nothing to &s;quander away whole Evenings, almo&s;t every Day, in mere Sloth &amp; Diver&s;ion! Will not the Reckoning &s;well high at the Year's end! If all your lo&s;t Hours were put together, how great a Sum wou'd they amount to! Surely too great to obtain the Divine Allowance. &mdash; And do you con&s;ider (Sirs) that you have much weighty Bu&s;ine&s;s (be&s;ides your &s;ecular Affairs) lying upon your hands, which be&s;peaks the mo&s;t dili|gent, the mo&s;t vigorous Application of all your Pow|ers; being eno' of it &s;elf (had you no other Concern) to fill up the narrow &s;pace of this &s;hort Life!

Con|&s;ider how &s;wiftly your important Minutes fly away, and none of them can be recovered: One &s;ingle Moment, when pa&s;t, can't be recal'd; cannot be purchas'd. <HI>What &s;hall a Man give in Exchange?</HI> It cannot begotten for Gold, neither &s;hall Silver be weighed for the price thereof. Verily the Price of it is above Rubies. &mdash;So <HI>damned Gho&s;ts</HI> think; who doubtle&s;s wou'd give all the World (were it theirs) for tho&s;e probational Opportu|nities, which we are now in the happy Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, but (alas!) do too fooli&s;hly idle away.&mdash; O let us learn to value our <HI>Day of Grace,</HI> hitherto prolonged, more than we have done: and let the very Tho't of <HI>Pa&s;s-time</HI> be as abhor'd, as it is ab&s;urd, and let it not be <HI>once named</HI> among us, as becometh Saints. Let us look on our&s;elves as Pilgrims &amp; Strangers upon Earth, and pa&s;s the time of our &s;ojourning here in Fear; looking for &amp; ha&s;ting unto the coming of the Day of GOD<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.17&mdash;II 3.12.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>O think, we be&s;eech you, think what will be the Fruit of this Cour&s;e you are in. Verily the Be&s;t I&s;&s;ue you can expect is that you will &s;ooner or later <HI>Repent</HI> of it. And will you act &s;o fooli&s;h a part as wilfully to make your &s;elves work for Repentance! Do but con&s;ider the Nature of Repentance; what Anxiety, and Shame, and Grief, and Fear it implies: and it &s;hould &s;eem you can't be willing to purcha&s;e a little Plea&s;ure at &s;o dear a rate.&mdash; <HI>Knowing the Terror of the Lord,</HI> we per&s;wade you &mdash;. O be <HI>wi&s;e in time</HI>: Seeing the Error of your way, in&s;tantly re&s;olve upon Refor|mation.</P>
<P>Now take up tho&s;e wi&s;e and good Purpo&s;es, which you can't but think you'l be ready to make on a Sick Bed. Be peremptory and &s;olemn in your Re|&s;olutions: and immediately put them in practice. Be &s;tedfa&s;t &amp; immovable. Watch &amp; Pray, that ye enter not into Temptation. Carefully guard again&s;t every thing that will tend to in&s;nare you: and in particular, take heed that a fal&s;e Mode&s;ty, an ea&s;y Humour, and Complai&s;ance to Company don't betray you.

Fortify your &s;elves again&s;t all Inticements, by carry|ing proper &s;erious Tho'ts about with you continu|ally; by frequently renewing your &s;olemn Vows, and daily committing your &s;elves to the Keeping of Di|vine Grace.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;hew'd our Opinion, and given you our faithful Advice. We now commend you to GOD who has all Hearts in his Hand; and be&s;eech Him to crown this our Endeavour with the de&s;ired Suc|ce&s;s, by his effectual Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX.</HI> THERE has fallen into our hands a private Letter of the late Reverend Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather</HI>'s, upon the Sub|ject of the foregoing Pages, written to one of his Neighbours: A Copy of which we think fit to annex; and <HI>by it, He being dead, yet &s;peaketh.</HI> 'Tis as follows:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Brother</HI> &mdash;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHO' I am fuller of Bu&s;ine&s;s than I have been (to my knowledge) ever &s;ince my coming to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> yet out of re&s;pect to my <HI>Word,</HI> and my Love to <HI>You,</HI> I &s;end you the following &s;hort An&s;wer, to the <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> upon which you de&s;ired my Apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>QUESTION,</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHETHER it be Lawful for a Church-Member among us, to be frequently in Taverns</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>ANSWER,</HI></P>
<P>In the following <HI>PROPOSITIONS,</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="28" REF="002780_0034_0FE632A0717623D0"><HI>I.</HI> It is <HI>not</HI> Lawful for a Church-Member to be in <HI>Taverns</HI> oftner than <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> calleth for it.</P>
<P>And this is evident,</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e we are to <HI>Ab&s;tain from all Appearance of Evil,</HI> 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> V. 22. <HI>Jude</HI> 23. Now, This has an <HI>Appearance of Evil.</HI> It looks &s;omething like being a <HI>Pot-Companion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e we mu&s;t avoid all <HI>Temptations to Sin.</HI> Where any Evil is <HI>forbidden,</HI> it is <HI>required</HI> that the <HI>Temptations</HI> leading to that Evil, &s;hould be &s;hunned. Therefore the Rule that forbids <HI>Drunkenne&s;s,</HI> does al&s;o prohibit being unnece&s;&s;arily where there is <HI>much Drink</HI> a going, that may be a <HI>Temptation to Exce&s;s. Gen.</HI> XXXIX. 10. <HI>Prov.</HI> V. 8.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e we mu&s;t, as much as may be, avoid the giving of <HI>Occa&s;ion unto others</HI> to Sin. Yea, a Chri&s;tian &s;hould abridge him&s;elf of his <HI>lawful Liberty,</HI> if it prove an <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> for others to Sin again&s;t GOD. And therefore the Apo&s;tle forbids Eating in an <HI>Idols Temple</HI>: Not but that it was in it &s;elf Law|ful to Eat <HI>there,</HI> or in any other Place; becau&s;e no Places under the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> are either Holy or Profane, as under the <HI>Law</HI>: but becau&s;e &s;ome would by that means be occa&s;ioned to commit <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and be hardned in Sin, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> VIII. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> For Church-Members to <HI>Chu&s;e</HI> to tran&s;act their <HI>Civil, Affairs</HI> in the <HI>Tavern</HI>&punc; when they might as well do it at their own Hou&s;es, is an Evil in the Sight of GOD.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. They <HI>occa&s;ion others to Sin</HI> again&s;t GOD. The more Carnal &s;ort of People will &s;ay, <HI>Such and &s;uch are often in Taverns, for all they make a Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and are Members of Churche.</HI> Thus the <HI>way of Truth is evil &s;poken of.</HI> And tho'

<HI>Godly</HI> Per&s;ons may go into the <HI>Tavern</HI> for lawful Ends, to di&s;patch their lawful Affairs, yet the <HI>Un|godly</HI> will from thence take Advantage to follow <HI>Taverns</HI> for unlawful Ends, even to <HI>Drink</HI> and be <HI>Drunken</HI> there. Now, a Chri&s;tian &s;hould be very Tender of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;o much as an Occa&s;ion of Di&s;ho|nour to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> of wrong to the Souls of any. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> XXII. 22. <HI>Rom.</HI> XIV. 13. <HI>Gal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> 14. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> II. 10.</P>

<P N="2">2. When Men do thus <HI>unnece&s;&s;arily frequent Ta|verns,</HI> it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> be Ju&s;t with GOD, to <HI>leave them</HI> to fall into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> If a Man <HI>wilfully</HI> for&s;ake GOD in never &s;o &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters">tter, he may well fear that GOD will for&s;ake him. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> XV. 2. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> LXXXI. 11, 12.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>III</HI> IT is not unlawful for a Church-Member to go into the Tavern, when the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Civil Calling does <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> Call him thereunto.</P>
<P>And this is evident,</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e a <HI>Tavern</HI> is not in it &s;elf an <HI>unlawful Place.</HI> We read of <HI>Inns</HI> in the Scripture; and of Good Men that when called thereunto, have gone into them. <HI>Gen.</HI> XLII. 27. <HI>Exod.</HI> IV. 24. <HI>Luk.</HI> II. 7.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e the Duties of a Man's <HI>General,</HI> and of his <HI>Particular</HI> Calling, may &s;tand well together. A Man's <HI>General Calling,</HI> as he is a Chri&s;tian, does not Nullify, but rather Confirm his <HI>Particular Calling,</HI> and makes it &s;anctified unto him. *** 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> VII. 20. &mdash; V. 10.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> If a Church-Member be Nece&s;&s;itated to be in the <HI>Tavern,</HI> he ought to carry him&s;elf <HI>Circum|&s;pectly there.</HI></P>
