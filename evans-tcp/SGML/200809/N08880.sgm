<P>The following manife&s;t, and &s;ome others which will be &s;peedily publi&s;hed, with <HI>the many re&s;pectable names</HI> in them, will be&s;t &s;how the truth of their a&s;&s;ertion, that the non-im|portation Agreement was generaly conformed to, and that the importation were trifling.&mdash;It mu&s;t likewi&s;e be proper to inform the public, that upwards of <HI>Thirty Ve&s;&s;els</HI> have arrived in this port from Great-Britain &s;ince January 1&s;t 1769, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e exact account of their cargoes, &s;hall be publi&s;hed in the cour&s;e of this paper.&mdash;The one now publi&s;hed, is all at pre&s;ent that the attention due to my other avocations, would me allow time to prepare for the in&s;pection of the public.</P>
<P>I intreat "THE WELL DISPOSED MER|CHANTS" carfully to peru&s;e the above Mani|fe&s;t, and recommend it in a partlicular man|ner to the attention of their Chairman, who may be a very good Di&s;tiller of Rum, for any thing I know, but who has no title to be cal|led a Merchant, and he never had any con|cern in importing Goods from Britain that I can learn.</P>

<P>HAVING learnt, the day after my la&s;t Pu|blication, for the fir&s;t time, that the Chairman of the Merchants, really imported goods from England, preceding the year 1761, I, with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s, admit, during the period of his Importations, he ought to be con&s;idered as a Merchant; but being now occupied in a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o very different and having cea&s;ed Importation entirely for many years&mdash;however honourable he may be by &s;tation, or however re&s;pectable in his bu&s;i|ne&s;s,&mdash;as a Di&s;tiller, he can, at pre&s;ent, have no title, even to the name of Merchant.</P>
<P>THE PUBLIC, will no doubt perceive, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the cargoes of the ve&s;&s;els, are given without regard to what was excluded from or incl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters"> in the Non-importation agreement; a regard to ju&s;tice inducing me to lay the whole before them&mdash;and as the penetration of the can did readers mu&s;t, often naturally, lead them to recur to the articles, agreed upon Augu&s;t 1768, they are, for that purpo&s;e, in&s;erted anew in this paper.</P>
<P>That the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed Merchants"</HI> who took the Lead at the different Meetings, have di&s;played ill grounded and pointed antipathy,
<PB N="10" REF="011336_0008_0F8580BA8E521F58">
in my ca&s;e, mu&s;t appear evident, as well as great partialities to others, when they allowed &s;o many re&s;pectable and &s;o many large Impor|ters, as were mentioned in our la&s;t and in this Paper, to pa&s;s unnoticed.&mdash;A charge, which tho' &s;ufficiently obvious already, &s;hall be more ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-demon&s;trated in the cour&s;e of this laborious, yet nece&s;&s;ary Undertaking.</P>
<P>Indeed the&s;e <HI>Few "Well Di&s;po&s;ed" Leaders,</HI> not only, acted unju&s;tly, with regard to me, who never was nor con&s;idered my&s;elf in the light of a Merchant; but they have al&s;o impo&s;ed upon the <HI>really</HI> well di&s;po&s;ed part of the Gentlemen pre&s;ent at the&s;e Meetings, (who implicitly tru&s;ted to their information and report), by exhibiting a partial li&s;t of the Importers; and have &s;ince, by their Adver|ti&s;ement, attempted to impo&s;e on the Public in general.</P>
<P>The Manife&s;ts of the three following Ve&s;|&s;els will contribute greatly to place this in a proper point of view.</P>

<P>THE Merchants of this town met according to adjournment on Thur&s;day la&s;t, when the committee appointed to make enquiry relative to the importation of goods by the ve&s;&s;els late|ly arrived from Great-Britain, reported, that five or &s;ix per&s;ons, who were &s;igners to the late agreement, had received a few articles (the remains of former orders) and were rea|dy to deliver them up to the care of the com|mittee; and that &s;ome who where not &s;igners had imported &s;ome goods prohibited by the late agreement, which as to quality and quan|tity were very &s;mall.&mdash;The Merchants then appointed a committee to confer with the per|&s;ons la&s;t mentioned, and to con&s;ider what mea|&s;ures might be proper to take to prevent any further importation, and then adjourned their meeting to Tue&s;day next (to-morrow) at four o'clock P.

<P>Mr. <HI>John Mein,</HI> Printer and Book|&s;eller from Scotland, having in his Chronicle of the 17th in&s;tant undertaken to vindicate his importing Goods contrary to the Agree|ment of the Merchants, and al&s;o &s;ubjoined a partial Schedule of the Importations which have taken place from February to June la&s;t, declaring his intention to render the &s;ame compleat from the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Entries, in the cour&s;e of his Papers, the Public are de&s;ir|ed to &s;u&s;pend their judgement upon this Af|fair, as we learn the Committee of Merchants have it in their power to &s;atisfy the mo&s;t pre|judiced that the account Mr&punc; Mein has given cannot in the lea&s;t invalidate the declarations that have been made from time to time on that &s;ubject, but choo&s;e to wait till Mr. Mein has fini&s;hed his work, when they will doubt|le&s;s undertake to undeceive them and prevent the mi&s;chief de&s;igned by his very impertinent and unju&s;t repre&s;entations of the affair. In the mean time, it may not be improper to remark, that his attempt to make the Public believe that the declarations of the Merchants in April la&s;t are untrue, becau&s;e &s;ome impor|tations were made &s;ix weeks after that time, is very extraordinary, and di&s;covers that he has a peculiar knock at rea&s;oning.</P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>I Pre&s;ent my compliments to the Authors of the above Adverti&s;ements; I am really &s;or|ry they neglected to &s;ign their names to their publications; charity her&s;elf mu&s;t only im|pute it to forgetfulne&s;s, and far be it from me to hint that it was either owing to &s;hame or timidity.&mdash;On the contrary with real good will, I beg of the Authors to remedy this omi&s;&s;ion in their next pieces, for &s;uch naked Adverti&s;ements cannot gain any degree of cre|dit with impartial readers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make but few &s;trictures on the&s;e two publications, it being beneath any man to contend with opponents &s;heltered under a ma&s;k: I &s;hall however, conde&s;cend for once, and I intreat the Public carefully to read the la&s;t &s;entence of the fir&s;t Anonymous Adverti&s;e|ment, and then to con&s;ult the Bo&s;ton Chro|nicle of la&s;t Monday, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n which, the manife&s;ts of two ve&s;&s;els, belonging to Mr. Hancock, are given; one of which ve&s;&s;els arrived April 10th, the other on the 18th of the &s;aid month; and al&s;o to compare the following cargo, [brought in the London Packet, Capt.

But this, as I have already declared &s;hall be more fully demon&s;trated in the cour&s;e of this undertak|ing.</P>
<P>On reading the <HI>"True account"</HI> given of Capt Scott's Cargo by the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> committee, I felt &s;entiments ari&s;e in my mind, which would be painful to me to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear&s;e.&mdash;I therefore merely out of pity and compa&s;&s;ion, mo&s;t earne&s;tly beg of them, for their own &s;ake, to take their <HI>"True account"</HI> again into their &s;erious con&s;ideration, and not again pre&s;ent it to the public, till they have made the nece&s;&s;ary amendments.&mdash;Wi&s;hing they may adopt this advice, I &s;hall for the pre&s;ent draw a veil over that Publication.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 31&s;t, 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Thomas Gray having acted with the candour and good manners becoming a gentleman of his fair character, I believe what he has declared to be true, that the <HI>"Bales T. G. No.</HI> 1 <HI>and</HI> 2, <HI>were Ravens Duck and Ticklingburgh:"</HI> The&s;e bales, however, were entered out by the name of German and Ru&s;&s;ia Linen; and I could not divine that they had any other name: but granting I had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that happy talent, I could not in ju|&s;tice to the Public or to my&s;elf, have mentioned them, under any other denomination than that expre&s;&s;ed in the cocket. As to the 26 ca&s;ks marked J. S. and con&s;igned to him, there was no cocket for them; they were only in the manife&s;t; it was my duty to give them to the Public exactly as the ma&s;ter had put them in his manife&s;t; for it would have been impro|per for me even to conjecture what they contain|ed, when the manife&s;t, though it mentioned the marks, number of the ca&s;ks, and per&s;ons name to whom con&s;igned, did not mention the contents. It would not have been ami&s;s, however, if Mr. Gray had, in his Adverti&s;e|ment, told the Public the contents of the&s;e ca&s;ks.</P>
<P>Several Anonymous publications having been in&s;erted in Me&s;&s;rs. Fleets and Edes and Gill's, News-papers of Monday la&s;t&mdash;I call upon the authors of them to make known their names: as every man who takes the freedom of addre&s;&s;ing the public ought to do,
<PB N="35" REF="011336_0020_0F8580C6A4E81EC0">
not only that he may be the more readily be|lieved, but al&s;o, out of re&s;pect to the tribu|nal to which he makes his appeal. I have al|ready repeatedly declared that I would pay no attention to Anonymous Writers: they in|deed &s;ufficiently reply to their own perform|ances by their fear and &s;hame of avowing them openly.&mdash;If they came from <HI>a few of the "Well Di&s;po&s;ed" Leaders,</HI> they no doubt &s;huddered at the very thought of confe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves the authors of &s;uch pieces, in which veracity is &s;o deeply wound|ed and their own unworthy conduct &s;o filthily &s;lubbered over.</P>
<P>The Merchants in general in this Town, Province, and Continent, and every unpreju|diced Reader, will&punc; at one view, on peru&s;ing their weak, confu&s;ed performances, &s;ee, that the more they &s;truggle again&s;t truth, the more they will expo&s;e and bewilder them&s;elves by their contradictions.</P>
<P>I, therefore, out of tenderne&s;s to you, the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> recommend again your <HI>"True Account"</HI> of Capt. Scott's and Capt. Smith's Cargoes, to your mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;i|deration</P>
<P>Plea&s;e al&s;o to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avour the Public with a li&s;t of the &s;igners to the Agreement of Augu&s;t; 1768?</P>
<P>Pray let us know who were the &s;ix &s;igners, <HI>Who through inattention had omitted to conter|mand their orders</HI> and how you di&s;po&s;ed of the goods of the&s;e <HI>&s;ix inattentive &s;igners?</HI></P>
<P>Do likewi&s;e imform us how the Committee di&s;po&s;ed of the goods, put into their hands la&s;t April, as well as the Marks, Numbers, Contents of the various Packages with the per|&s;ons names to whom they were con&s;igned?</P>
<P>But, above all, it would be a great piece of &s;atisfact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> to the Public to learn, and &s;urely very great conde&s;cen&s;ion in the Committee, to point out where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> kept Store May 3d, 1769.</P>
<P>I hope the Committee will feel <HI>well di&s;|po&s;ed</HI> to an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions; and that they will not be a&s;hamed to do it in their own proper names: As I &s;hall then think it a duty incumbent on me to give a pointed reply to every thing they advance.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, the public is greatly at a lo&s;s to know, <HI>Who ye are?</HI> You that have underta|ken to regulate the Trade of the Town and the Province; and who have a&s;&s;umed a right to prai&s;e and to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>WHO ARE YE? YOU COMMITTEE MEN OF MERCHANTS! <HI>who di&s;turb the Public with your anonymous clamours.</HI>&mdash;WE KNOW YE NOT.&mdash;<HI>For from the re&s;pectable li&s;t of Importers, we are really at a lo&s;s even to conceive, what are your de&s;ignations, or where you re&s;ide.</HI></P>
<P>May I be indulged in a few ob&s;ervations on <HI>&s;ome of the "well di&s;po&s;ed?"</HI> pray when you re|view your pa&s;t conduct, [though the hurry of action may have carried you through every &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">newithout he&s;itation,] in your cooler mo|ments, Do you not even cea&s;e to e&s;teem your|&s;elves? Do you never blu&s;h in &s;ecret, or when you meet each other in the &s;treet? Does reflec|tion never awaken within you?&mdash;Does your pa&s;t tran&s;actions, in your hours of retirement, never mar&s;hal them&s;elves before your aching imaginations?&mdash;Do you never &s;tart in your &s;leep, while all nature is hu&s;h, and only the &s;oul awake at its &s;elf-review?&mdash;Or, are you &s;o dead and mortified to every &s;en&s;ation of Ju&s;|tice, that you can proceed in the uniform te|nor of depravity, without the lea&s;t remor&s;e, without ever looking behind you?</P>
<P>If the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of honour, remains in your brea&s;ts, publi&s;h your names, that, perhaps will, however ill you may have behaved, im|pre&s;s the Public with a belief, that you have acted from principle; and that, however you may have erred, it mu&s;t have been from de|fect in judgment, not becau&s;e you were de&s;|titute of worth.</P>
<P>Let me before I take leave of you for the pre|&s;ent, be&s;tow on you &s;ome whole&s;ome advice: Repent and Reform!&mdash;and if you &s;hould find your&s;elves at any future meeting, where the

real well wi&s;hers of the Province are collected, do not give countenance to any Anonymous Publication; adopt a new plan on more mode|rate principles; not &s;uch a one as &s;ome among you mu&s;t be the fir&s;t to break: and &s;how to the world by your future behaviour that if private re&s;entment, pa&s;&s;ion, or prejudice hur|ried you beyond the bounds of your duty to your fellow citizens, that, on having the right path pointed out to you, you returned to it with gladne&s;s of heart.</P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>September</HI> 4<HI>th</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING been very unju&s;tly treated in an anonymous Adverti&s;ement, I judged it nece&s;&s;ary, in my own defence, to give my rea|&s;ons for declining to &s;ign the non-importati|on agreement; among which, were, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity I was under of &s;upporting <HI>&s;eventeen peo|ple</HI> employed in a profe&s;&s;ion worthy of encou|ragement in every civilized country, and in two other branches of bu&s;ine&s;s, clo&s;ely con|nected with, and immediately depending up|on that profe&s;&s;ion. I have al&s;o &s;hewn, that I have given very great encouragement to the manufactures of this province in my various occupations: And I can, with the mo&s;t &s;acred adherence to truth, declare, that I have all along been deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the warm|e&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude for the many and great favours which I have received, and daily con|tinue to receive, from the Public.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation then, my&s;elf not a mer|chant, and con&s;idering my&s;elf as wholly out of the line of the agreement again&s;t import|ing Engli&s;h goods, for I never imagined that Books and Paper pa&s;&s;ed under that denomina|tion; in this &s;ituation, I &s;ay, &s;eeing my&s;elf attacked in the mo&s;t unwarrantable and lurk|ing manner, and being convinced too, that this attack proceeded from the private enmity of a few of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> was it not both natural and proper for me to undertake my own vindication?&mdash;Which could be ac|compli&s;hed in no other manner, than by giv|ing my rea&s;ons, as I have already done, and al&s;o, the <HI>&s;tate</HI> of the importations &s;ince the a|greement took place;&mdash;In which &s;tate, <HI>&s;o ma|ny very re&s;pectable Names appear,</HI> as mu&s;t con|vince the public, that the non-importation a|greement, was not generally conformed to; and that the few <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> who publi&s;h|ed the adverti&s;ement in which I was &s;o inju|riou&s;ly u&s;ed, could only be actuated again&s;t, me by the black pa&s;&s;ions of envy and mali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">permitted &s;o many and &s;uch large importations, to pa&s;s unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this nece&s;&s;ary undertaking I very ju&s;tly publi&s;hed in the manife&s;t of the Lydia, Captain Hood, five bales of Briti&s;h Linen, marked J. H. as they were &s;hipped by Mr. Hancock's corre&s;pondent, and entered out in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e of London; which five bales &s;o marked are, in the Ma&s;ter's mani|fe&s;t, &s;aid to be con&s;igned to John Hancock, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>&mdash;Mr. Hancock having gone out of town the morning of this publication, Mr. William
<PB N="40" REF="011336_0023_0F8580C8A8A02198">
Palfrey his clerk, made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ales con|tained only "one hundred pieces Ru&s;&s;ia Duck; this occa&s;ioned a publication of an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ted Co|py of the Cocket in the next Chronicle, to which Mr. William Palfrey made a long reply in the Bo&s;ton News Letter of Thur&s;day la&s;t, in which, though he &s;ays very little indeed to the matter in di&s;pute, he talks much of his Ma&s;ter, him|&s;elf, and his motives.&mdash;The ca&s;e, in &s;hort, is ju&s;t as follows:&mdash;Mr. Hancock's corre&s;pondent and the officers of the port of London, enter out 100 pieces Briti&s;h Linen, in five bales, marked, J. H. which bales, marked J. H. are mentioned in the manife&s;t, con&s;igned to John Hancock <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;o that in whatever light this mat|ter is viewed, or in whatever manner it may be determined, I am fully defen&s;ible.&mdash;I was ob|liged to give the contents of the&s;e bales as Mr. Hancock's corre&s;pondent entered them out at the port of London, as the Cu&s;tom officers there cleared them out, and to annex Mr. Hancock's name to the bales &s;o marked, as the ma&s;ter of his own ve&s;&s;el had done in the Manife&s;t he de|livered into this Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.&mdash;This affair, therefore re&s;ts, as I &s;aid before, between Mr. Hancock's corre&s;pondent, a Gentleman of great and e&s;tabli&s;hed character, and Mr. Wil|liam Palfrey, Clerk to Mr. Hancock.</P>
<P>What Mr. William Palfrey &s;ays, concerning the publi&s;hing of the Cocket, being intended to convey the idea that his ma&s;ter had im|ported a quantity of Stuffs, Gloves and Haber|da&s;hery, is both weak and ridiculous; for if his confu&s;ion would have allowed him, to read it, he mu&s;t have perceived that all the other articles mentioned in it, have marks quite different from Mr. Hancock's; and if he had taken the trouble to compare the&s;e marks in the atte&s;ted Cocket, with the Manife&s;t of Capt. Hood's cargo as publi&s;hed by me, he would in one minute have found there, the per&s;ons names to whom the&s;e goods were con&s;igned.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e is very lavi&s;h of ill lan|guage, and raves much about p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rty.&mdash;I was always too independent to adopt the principles of any party. Let the public judge, which of us is engaged in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m of Par|ty&mdash;he who in every &s;entence foams out abu&s;e and party declamation, or he who &s;ole|ly attending to his own vindication never de|viated &s;o far from the &s;ubject, as to mention the word&mdash;This mu&s;t appear &s;o obvious to every candid reader, that I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no far|ther on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Without producing any thing to the point in que&s;tion, Mr. William Palfrey, in his la&s;t publication, parades very much indeed, by which he appears to be mighty willing to rai&s;e a cloud, under the &s;hade of which he might make his retreat, and at la&s;t fairly dives into the region of poetic non&s;en&s;e, where at pre|&s;ent he remains immer&s;ed in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Few "Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> having been re|peatedly called upon to publi&s;h a Manife&s;t of Capt. Scott's cargo, the demand is again made, and I now take the freedom, with the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> to inform the public, that what has been publi&s;hed in two of the Mondays, and one of the Thur&s;day's Papers as a <HI>True Account</HI> of that cargo, is very far from de&s;erving that name.&mdash;I al&s;o de&s;ire them to give an account of the Marks, Num|bers, Packages and Contents, of the goods that arrived in the Na&s;&s;au, Capt. Smith, all of which are &s;aid, by an Anonymous Adverti&s;e|ment, to be in their &s;tores; if they really are &s;o, they cannot be at any lo&s;s to &s;atisfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the public.</P>
<P>The gentlemen concerned in importation, are advi&s;ed to follow the open and candid ex|ample, &s;hewn them by Mr. Gray.</P>
<P>As Me&s;&s;rs. Averys have declared that they have not imported for two years, yet as the name of John Avery is in Capt. Coleman's manife&s;t, which manife&s;t is extremely di&s;|tinct; I recommend al&s;o to the Committee, to apply to the owners, who certainly can in|form them who paid the freight for the&s;e pack|ages.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="011336_0023_0F8580C8A8A02198">
Mr. Francis Johonnot, has accounted for the trunk con&s;igned to him with great clearne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Benjamin Andrews, al&s;o de&s;erves thanks for &s;igning his name to his adverti&s;ement; though I wi&s;h he had been as explicit as Mr. Johonnot; there being no doubt, that the&s;e goods have been imported, it mu&s;t be the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the per&s;on to whom they are con|&s;igned in the manife&s;t, to point out particu|larly how they have been di&s;po&s;ed of, e&s;peci|ally if that per&s;on is a &s;igner to the agreement.</P>
<P>The <HI>few "well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> are in fact, at pre&s;ent, undergoing a cour&s;e of di&s;cipline <HI>"a po&s;teriori"</HI> that being the only method of attacking them, as they do not incline to &s;how their faces.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the &s;ucce&s;s of this publication with re&s;pect to the drawing them out to public view, I am well convinced, that it mu&s;t have a very &s;alutary effect on their future conduct in life, for they will neither be &s;o forward, in time to come, to publi&s;h ano|nymous adverti&s;ements filled with untruths, nor will they be &s;o ready to break through <HI>"&s;olemn agreements"</HI> which they may have &s;igned.</P>

<P>MR.

<P>It was rather unfortunate too, for Mr. Francis Green to declare, that he can make it appear, he never ordered the four ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f allum and copperas; which is by no means a &s;uffici|ent apology; for to ju&s;tify him&s;elf in the eye of the Public, it ought to be made evident, that he never received them into his cu&s;tody; that the Committee took them into their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; that they remain &s;o &s;till; for in &s;ay|ing, that he <HI>"&s;ubmitted them to the direction of the Committee"</HI> is &s;omething very je&s;uitical.&mdash;Pray Mr. Francis Green, how did the Com|mittee direct them to be di&s;po&s;ed of? Do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o mention, where the Committee kept &s;tore the 1&s;t of May la&s;t, the very day your ve&s;&s;el entered; becau&s;e they may have given you <HI>"direction"</HI> to keep the&s;e 4 ca&s;ks in your own &s;tore; and perhaps, by this time, you may have di&s;po&s;ed of them.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> kind to your&s;elf, as to mention the names of the &s;ix per&s;ons, in this town, whom you your&s;elf confe&s;s to have imported goods? and that the town of Salem may not remain under the general imputation of breaking the agreement, indulge the public with the names of the Salem Importers?</P>
<P>To whom were the five che&s;ts of Tea mark|ed H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;igned to, and where were they landed?</P>
<P>I did you all nece&s;&s;ary ju&s;tice concerning the goods landed at Salem, which I menti|oned in the account I gave of your ve&s;&s;els cargo.</P>
<P>It behoves you Mr. Francis Green to be ve|ry explicit in your reply, for if you &s;hew any degree of equivocation, charity it&s;elf will be almo&s;t forced to place the&s;e five che&s;ts of tea, con&s;igned to order, to your own particular account. But that you may vindicate your|&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ully is really my wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Mr. Hancock being now returned to town, it would &s;eem a piece of ju&s;tice in him, to in|form the public, of the names of the Impor|ters of the 75 barrels Gunpowder, and 34 casks of Chee&s;e mentioned in the Manife&s;t of the La&s;t Attempt, Capt. Lyde; and the names of the per&s;ons to whom the packages, marked T. O. and G. D. in the Lydia, Captain Hood, were con&s;igned.</P>

<P>I Hope Mr. Hancock, when he has lei&s;ure, will an&s;wer the que&s;tions, which have been twice put to him; as for his Clerk, till he can inva|lidate the atte&s;ted Cocket, which I have pub|li&s;hed, it would conduce more to his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice for him to be &s;ilent. Mr. Gray's cha|racter, &s;o well known, and &s;o fully e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, entitles him to general re&s;pect&punc; to mine he had a particular claim, that of having li|mited him&s;elf &s;olely to his own vindication, without de&s;cending to rake the kennels of abu&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Handy&s;ide Peck is de&s;ired to inform the public, if he is a &s;igner to the agreement, and to give his rea&s;ons for receiving into his cu&s;|tody, two hog&s;heads of Hats, and one ca&s;e of haberda&s;hery, con&s;igned to him, which arriv|ed in the London Packet, Capt.

<P>Likewi&s;e to give an account of the contents of the ca&s;e, marked THP. mentioned in the following <HI>atte&s;ted cocket</HI> of the &s;hip Thomas, Capt. Davies, to contain 20 dozen Ca&s;tor, and 20 dozen Felt Hats; as it appears by the Bo&s;|ton Evening Po&s;t of this day, which I have ju&s;t &s;een, that he has denied it contained Hats in a manner &s;omewhat outrageous.</P>

<P>Which Ca&s;e marked THP is &s;aid in the Ma|nife&s;t, to be con&s;igned to Thomas Handy&s;ide Peck, which Manife&s;t was delivered in, and &s;wore to, at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e here, by Capt. Davies.</P>
<P>The above Cocket puts me wholly out of the di&s;pute; it proves the fact I had a&s;&s;erted:&mdash;How then could this weak man be &s;o blind to all &s;en&s;e of decency and regard to him&s;elf and his friend at home! as to expo&s;e the latter to the charge of a fal&s;e entry, and him&s;elf to be a&s;ked this que&s;tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> What did the Box really contain? This man &s;urely de&s;erves pity! but perhaps, the Box contained Dye &s;tuffs or In|digo; if it was really this la&s;t mentioned arti|cle, allow me, Mr. Peck, to propo&s;e a &s;mall a|mendment to your next proce&s;&s;ion with your Box and Bell;&mdash;be &s;ure to have the Word, INDIGO, painted, in large capital characters, on the &s;ides of your Box;&mdash;let the number of the bells be encrea&s;ed, and appended round your own neck, you will, then, be character|i&s;tically dre&s;&s;ed, and may prance before your decorated Box, with all the frantic &s;olemnity becoming &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">-&s;how.</P>
<P>Every man before he attacks another, ought carefully to look at home; and though he thinks him&s;elf invulnerable there, a re&s;pect to his own character ought to prevent him from behaving with brutality. Mr. Thomas Han|dey&s;ide Peck is therefore de&s;ired coolly to con|&s;ider this hint, and not in future to adopt ha&s;|ty mea&s;ures; for the Public may yet &s;ee his name appear in the Manife&s;t of more than one ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>May the curtain of oblivion, for the pre&s;ent, wrap in its thicke&s;t folds, all remembrance of the affair above mentioned, it has only been thus far undrawn, to &s;erve as a le&s;&s;on to others, not to deviate into gro&s;s abu&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed" Committee</HI> are entreat|ed to apply to the owners of the &s;hip Thomas, Capt. Davies, for the names of the per&s;ons, to whom, the great quantity of the <HI>duty articles,</HI> marked H. the numerous casks and ca&s;es of Painters colours, marked J C. W G. J O. J G. W C. the &s;everal packages, marked X in a di|mond, and J.

<P>JUSTICE, and a regard to my own charac|ter, would not permit me to be &s;ilent, af|ter the attempt made to injure me by the <HI>"Well di&s;po&s;ed'</HI> in their anonymous Adver|ti&s;ement; and I certainly have made it plain, that their are many more <HI>Importers</HI> than tho&s;e they have adverti&s;ed.</P>
<P>I lay nothing before the Public but what is in the Cockets and in the Manife&s;ts, which are &s;worn to by the Ma&s;ters of the &s;everal ve&s;|&s;els:&mdash;Every article that has been di&s;puted by people who have &s;igned their names, has been fully proved; and &s;ome of them, by &s;truggling to extricate them&s;elves, have only been more entangled in the net of evidence.</P>
<P>I therefore intreat Mr. Thomas Handa&s;yd Peck to compare the <HI>atte&s;ted Cocket,</HI> publi&s;hed in the Chronicle of Monday la&s;t, with his oath, printed in the Bo&s;ton Gazette, or, Country Journal, of the &s;ame day; he will in that cocket &s;ee 20 dozen Ca&s;tor, and 20 dozen Felt Hats, entered out in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, London, and &s;igned by the officers of that port; by the En|dor&s;ement on the back of the Cocket, the&s;e are &s;aid to be packed in a ca&s;e, marked THP. which ca&s;e &s;o marked, is put down to Thomas Handa&s;yd Peck, in the Manife&s;t given in, and &s;worn to, at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e here, by Capt. Davies.</P>
<P>I have proved in the cleare&s;t manner, what I had a&s;&s;erted:&mdash;Mr. Peck, him&s;elf has even &s;een the original cocket: This matter, now, re&s;ts between Mr. Peck and his Corre&s;pondent, again&s;t whom, his oath, has proved a fal&s;e entry.</P>
<P>I again call upon you, the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> to publi&s;h your li&s;t of Signers;&mdash;to mention the number of packages you have in your &s;tore, and the names of tho&s;e to whom they belong: and al&s;o to give the Public a more <HI>"true Account"</HI> of Capt.

Smith's cargoes:&mdash;and above all, do not forget to &s;ign your own names; though, after &s;o many repeated calls, I have little hope left, of your avowing tran&s;|actions, of which I believe you are thoroughly a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>Does not cruel reflection haunt your &s;olitary hours?&mdash;Do you not feel mi&s;erable under the &s;tripes which your folly, impudence, and ini|quity, have brought upon you?&mdash;If you have any thing human in you, you mu&s;t feel them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;It is a mortifying truth, but I mu&s;t tell it to you, that in the whole tenor of your con|duct, you never &s;eem to have been actuated by the &s;lendere&s;t idea of ju&s;tice.&mdash;Do not then continue to abu&s;e the patience of the Public, with anonymous fal&s;hoods! for words un&s;upported by proofs, mu&s;t, to the judici|ous and candid, appear di&s;hone&s;t and contemp|tible&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to build a durable &s;uper&s;tructure upon deceit and inju&s;tice; you may go on, indeed, for a while, and from hope may &s;natch a momentary gleam of &s;ucce&s;s;&mdash;but time and truth, the te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of all things, will &s;oon di&s;cover the in&s;ufficiency of your labour; and it will melt, like an image of ice, before the rays of the Meridian Sun.</P>

<P>THE Publication, taken from the Newport Mercury, would draw from me &s;ome animadver&s;ions, if Mr. Hancock was at pre&s;ent, in the Province; but on account of his ab&s;ence they &s;hall be delayed.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis Green notwith&s;tanding his va|pouring, in the Bo&s;ton Gazette, of monday September the 4th, &s;eems now by his &s;ilence, to be much puzzled, with the few &s;imple que&s;|tions, which I thought proper to a&s;k him, the Thur&s;day after his appearance in print: this &s;ilence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears a very doubtful a&s;pect, he ought to have embraced the fir&s;t opportunity to vin|dicate him&s;elf; if he is at a lo&s;s, let him take my advice, which I pre&s;ent to him with the greate&s;t &s;incerity; that is, at once, to tell the whole truth, concerning the tea, allum, &amp;c. and then he will neither be reduced to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to &s;ubterfuges, nor will he lie under the &s;u&s;picion of having im|ported contrary to agreement.</P>

Scotts Cargo, is very far from being a <HI>"true account:"</HI> I there|fore, advi&s;e them, to be expeditious in making o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t another; otherwi&s;e I &s;hall think my&s;elf in duty bound to compare that which they have already publi&s;hed with a manife&s;t in my po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; which, if the <HI>"w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have the lea&s;t grain of mode&s;ty remaining, will either prevent them from dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ving the pub|lic with fal&s;e accounts of the importations, or will oblige them, in future, to give much hone&s;ter reports.

<P>I INTREAT the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed",</HI> to an&s;wer the following que&s;tions; &s;ome of which have been repeatedly asked them.</P>
<P>Who were the <HI>"Seven Gentlemen"</HI> appoint|ed, at the meeting Friday April 21&s;t 1769, a Committee to examine the Manife&s;ts of the Cargoes of the ve&s;&s;els lately arrived, or that may arrive this &s;pring from any parts of Great Britain.&mdash;Why were not the reports of the&s;e <HI>&s;even Gentlemen</HI> publi&s;hed?&mdash;What are the names of the&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>&s;even Gentlemen?</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>When the meeting was held again, accord|ing to adjournment on Thur&s;day April 27th, and when the Committee appointed to make enquiry relative to the importation of goods by the ve&s;&s;els lately arrived from Great Bri|tain, REPORTED, that <HI>FIVE or SIX</HI> PERSONS who were Signers to the late agreement, had received a <HI>few articles,</HI> (the remains of former orders) and were ready to deliver them up to the care of the Committee.&mdash;I a&s;k, why were not the names of the five or &s;ix Signers, who were &s;o unlucky as to receive <HI>"the remains of former orders,"</HI> about eight months after the agreement was &s;igned, made public, with an account of the contents.</P>
<P>The &s;igners, who received <HI>"the remains of former orders"</HI> after &s;uch a di&s;tance of time, mu&s;t have very dilatory Corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e publi&s;h the marks, numbers, and packages, containing the <HI>"few Articles"</HI> &s;o received?</P>
<P>Well, but, it &s;eems, they <HI>"were ready to de|liver them up to the care of the Committee."</HI> Did the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> take <HI>care</HI> of the&s;e <HI>"few Articles"?</HI> and, where did they keep &s;tore, Thur&s;day April 27th, 1769?</P>
<P>At this Thur&s;day meeting, it was al&s;o re|ported, that &s;ome Gentlemen who were not &s;igners, had imported &s;ome goods prohibit|ed by the late agreement, which as to <HI>Qua|lity</HI> and Quantity <HI>were &s;mall.</HI></P>
<P>Who were the <HI>"&s;ome Gentlemen"</HI> that im|ported the <HI>"&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me goods prohibited,"</HI> by the late agreement, which, as to <HI>Quality</HI> and Quantity <HI>were &s;mall?</HI></P>
<P>Pray lay before the Public the packages and Contents?&mdash;It would al&s;o be very kind in the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> when they publi&s;h the <HI>quan|tity</HI> of the&s;e <HI>&s;ome Goods prohibited,</HI> to ex|plain the meaning of <HI>"which"</HI> in <HI>"quality" "were &s;mall."</HI>&mdash;This phra&s;e is, certainly, a|bove the comprehen&s;ion of mo&s;t Readers; and, perhaps, may even exceed that, of mo&s;t part of the Committee:&mdash;If this &s;hould really be the ca&s;e, I beg of them to con&s;ult their intel|ligent Chairman, who&s;e deep di&s;cernment and&punc; exten&s;ive knowledge, few things, within the circle of Science, can nonplus.</P>

<P>IN pur&s;uance of my promi&s;e to lay before the Public, a &s;tate of the goods imported from Great-Britain, &s;ince the beginning of January 1769&mdash;I publi&s;hed, on Monday, Au|gu&s;t 31&s;t, the manife&s;t of the cargo of the &s;hip Su&s;anna, Henry John&s;on, ma&s;ter, from Lon|don, and owned by Mr. Francis Green of Bo&s;|ton; at the &s;ame time, civilly reque&s;ting, the namele&s;s Committee of the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> to apply to the Owner, for the names <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the per|&s;ons to whom the goods con&s;igned <HI>To ORDER</HI> belonged: in the manife&s;t publi&s;hed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which was taken from the Cockets and Mani|fe&s;t, &s;worn to by the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, were two bales of Ru&s;&s;ia Linen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our bales of Ger|man Linen, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our ca&s;ks of Allum and Copperas, con&s;igned to Mr. Francis Green.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis Green, in the Bo&s;ton Gazette, and Country Journal, of Sept. 4th, replied, that <HI>to fru&s;trate the ba&s;e de&s;ign of deceiving the public, (which it &s;eems is lately become a favo|rite point with a few men more artful than ho|ne&s;t) I take this method of publicly declar|ing, that the articles (con&s;igned to me) termed Ru&s;&s;ia linnen and German linnen in the manife&s;t of the Su&s;anna, Henry John&s;on, from London, are Ravens Duck and Ticklinburgh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, which it is well known were comprehended in that of Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Cloth or Duck. It is true the Allum and Cop|per as were not enumerated among the allowed articles in the fir&s;t agreement; but it is as true that I never ordered them, (which I am ready to make appear) and that I &s;ubmitted them to the direction of the Committee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There were but &s;ix per&s;ons re&s;iding in this town who imported goods of any kind in the a|bove ve&s;&s;el, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of what little was on board, were for Salem and Marblehead, where they were accordingly entered and delivered before the &s;hip proceeded for this port.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>I do not a&s;&s;ert that the copy of the manife&s;t and cockets is not literally true, yet if &s;uch a publication of it</HI> (<HI>without an explanation which might have been given</HI>) <HI>has a tendency to deceive, as effectually as a direct fal&s;hood could, the good intention and candor of the publi&s;her, are</HI> (<HI>in charity,</HI>) <HI>referred to the judgment of the Public.</HI></P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved, in the next Bo&s;ton Chro|nicle, Sept. 7th, that Mr. Francis Green, to exculpate him&s;elf, ought to exhibit his In|voice, and mention the day the goods were &s;hipped.</P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervations were al&s;o made and the following que&s;tions a&s;ked, which, Mr. Francis Green was intreated to an&s;wer, with candour, for the &s;ake of his own character.</P>
<P>It was rather unfortunate too, for Mr. Francis Green to declare that he can make it appear, he never ordered the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our ca&s;ks of allum and copperas; which is by no means a &s;ufficient apology; for to ju&s;tify him&s;elf in the eye of the Public, it ought to be made evident, that he never received them into his cu&s;tody; that the Committee took them into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that they remain &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; for in &s;aying, that he <HI>"&s;ub|mitted them to the direction of the Committee"</HI> is &s;omething very je&s;uitical.&mdash;Pray Mr. Francis Green, how did the Committee di|rect them to be di&s;po&s;ed of? Do al&s;o men|tion, where the Committee kept &s;tore the 1&s;t of May la&s;t, the very day your ve&s;&s;el entered; becau&s;e they may have given you <HI>"direction"</HI> to keep the&s;e 4 ca&s;ks in your own &s;tore; and perhaps by this time, you may have di&s;po&s;ed of them.</P>
<P>Be &s;o kind to your&s;elf, as to mention the names of the &s;ix per&s;ons, in this town, whom you your&s;elf confe&s;s to have imported goods? and that the town of the Salem may not remain under the general imputation of breaking the agreement, indulge the public with the names of the Salem Im|porters?</P>
<P>To whom were the five che&s;ts of Tea mark|ed H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;igned, and where were they landed?</P>
<P>I did you all nece&s;&s;ary ju&s;tice concerning the goods landed at Salem, which I menti|oned in the account I gave of your ve&s;&s;el's cargo.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="011336_0038_0F8580D63078A930">
It behoves you Mr. Francis Green to be very explicit in your reply, for if you &s;hew any degree of equivocation, even <HI>"charity"</HI> it&s;elf, will be almo&s;t forced to place the&s;e five che&s;ts of tea, con&s;igned To Order, to your own particular account. But that you may vindi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate your&s;elf fully, is really my wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h.</P>
<P>On Sept. 18th, no reply being made by Mr. Francis Green, I put him in mind, that he &s;eemed now by his &s;ilence to be much puz|zled, with the few &s;imple que&s;tions which I thought proper to a&s;k him, the Thur&s;day after his appearance in print: this &s;ilence bears a very doubtful a&s;pect, he ought to have embraced the fir&s;t opportunity to vin|dicate him&s;elf; if he is at a lo&s;s, let him take my advice, which I pre&s;ent to him with the greate&s;t &s;incerity; that is, at once to tell the whole truth, concerning the tea, allum, &amp;c. and then he will neither be re|duced to the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to &s;ubterfuges, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or will he lie under the &s;u&s;|picion of having imported contrary to a|greement.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, Mr. Francis Green pub|li&s;hed a piece in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Gazette,</HI> or <HI>Bo&s;ton News-Letter,</HI> of September 21&s;t, of which the following extract contains the only apology, which he conde&s;cends to make for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"DISDAIN," is <HI>the true cau&s;e of my not hav|ing hitherto given any attention to his late public impertinent and arrogant queries and ob|jections.&mdash;"I now a&s;&s;ure the World" if any Gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> yet un&s;atisfied, and chu&s;es to ap|ply either to the</HI> Committee <HI>of</HI> Merchants <HI>or to</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>he may and &s;hall be convinced beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that I did not deviate from the agreement in any-in&s;tance, of cour&s;e, did not import any Tea.</HI></P>
<P>Then after throwing out the mo&s;t illiberal abu&s;e, without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of argument, he thinks proper to declare, that he will never an&s;wer any of my <HI>future publications.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is very likely, Mr. Francis Green, heartily regrets his not having adopted this prudent re&s;olution much &s;ooner.</P>
<P>When Mr&punc; Francis Green, &s;ays, that the Allum and Copperas were not allowed by the fir&s;t a|greement, he is very right; his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our ca&s;ks were imported here, May 1&s;t, and the vote allow|ing their importation, pa&s;&s;ed the 26th day of July after.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis Green al&s;o &s;ays, that HE <HI>was ready to make it appear, that</HI> HE <HI>never ordered them, and that</HI> HE <HI>had &s;ubmitted them to the direction of the</HI> Committee.</P>
<P>The public will naturally judge from his <HI>"di&s;dain"</HI> to vindicate him&s;elf, of the truth of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions. As for applying to him, after he had declared in print, that he was ready to make it appear, he never ordered the four ca&s;ks, &amp;c. he may be very ingenious at proving a negative, but every impartial man will con&s;ider him as a delinquent, till he makes his vindication as public as his a&s;&s;erti|ons.&mdash;As to the ca&s;ks having been &s;ubmitted to the care of the Committee, their &s;ilence and Mr. Francis Green's own words, will fully determine the opinion of the public; from me, they &s;carcely require a comment.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, that Mr. Francis Green de&s;ired tho&s;e who were un&s;atisfied with his conduct, to apply to the Committee, he ought &s;urely, for the information of the public, to have given the names of tho&s;e, who compo&s;e that tribunal of deceit: For the Public are, at pre&s;ent, greatly at a lo&s;s, to conceive who they are.</P>
<P>It was very weak in Mr. Francis Green, when pre&s;&s;ed by the above facts, and argu|ments, to have recour&s;e to <HI>"di&s;dain"</HI> and gro&s;s reproach, in&s;tead of attempting to ju&s;tify him&s;elf; when a man de&s;cends to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its a &s;ure &s;ign of his defeat.</P>
<P>Now, to u&s;e the very words of Mr. Francis Green, let the public judge, who he is that en|tertains <HI>"the ba&s;e de&s;ign of deceiving"</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and who he is that witholds the <HI>Explanation which might have been given.</HI> I really a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o far, with Mr. Francis Green, that deceiving

<P>Francis Green, Gentleman, living &s;o near me, if he thought him&s;elf affronted at my civilly intreating the Committee to apply to him, as owner of the Su&s;anna, might have waited upon me, and endeavoured to convince me, that he had &s;ome title to the appellation, &s;o frequently, here, be&s;towed on him: but the dirty road of abu&s;e, be&s;t &s;uiting his natural bi|as, he wallowed in its more, with that intem|perance&punc; be &s;itting a man, afraid of argument and hardened again&s;t plain dealing, though under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s;h of conviction&punc;</P>
<P>But perhaps, after all, the weakne&s;s of his intellects has only made him the tool of &s;ome more c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing man.&mdash;If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e he is indeed much to be pitied!</P>
<P>Let Francis Green, Gentleman, accept the advice I now give him, which is, if he has a|nother opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing the public, for his own &s;ake to do it with decency.</P>
<P>The <HI>"Well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> will plea&s;e to con&s;i|der the following que&s;tion as part of their Catechi&s;m.</P>

<P>PREVIOUS to the continuation of the <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> of the <HI>"Well di&s;po&s;ed",</HI> and to the ob&s;ervations that it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make on their Adverti&s;ements, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|treat the attention of the Public to the follow|ing &s;tory; which every Reader &s;hall, for the pre&s;ent, be left to apply as he &s;hall think pro|per.</P>
<P>ONE Evening, in the month of Augu&s;t, no matter for the day or year, two travel|lers arrived at a certain town in the we&s;tern hemi&s;phere, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large front room in the coffee hou&s;e, which for the &s;ake of the &s;tory, we &s;hall, at once, &s;uppo&s;e, to be the Briti&s;h Coffee-hou&s;e, King-&s;treet, Bo&s;ton; intending to &s;olace them&s;elves after the fatigues of a warm day's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide:&mdash;They were &s;carcely &s;eated, when a clamour of tongues i&s;&s;uing from an adjoining room, though they were not fond of li&s;tening, fir&s;t drew, and then by its continuance, fixed their attention. It was &s;oon di&s;covered, notwith&s;tanding the in|coherency of the conver&s;ation, that this noi&s;e proceeded from a motley Crew, called a Com|mittee, as our Travellers lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t from their own mouths:&mdash;And we, on our part, &s;hall &s;up|po&s;e, for the j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ke's &s;ake, that they too were, <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed."</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> Committee, "then, by their own account, appeared to have been, for &s;ome time, engaged in a deep and complica|ted &s;cheme to deceive the whole country, by declaring confidently in the face of the Pub|lic, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for importing goods from the Mother country, and that none &s;hould be imported:&mdash;The motives that fir&s;t occa&s;ioned this &s;cheme to be &s;et on foot being foreign to our purpo&s;e, we &s;hall not pretend to explain them; our &s;ole intention being only to make it evident, in what mann|er this agreement was kept, after it was en|tered into,</P>
<P>In the &s;equel, however, it will be plain be|yond di&s;pute, as it was to our Travellers who over-heard <HI>the&s;e "Well Di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> that views of private emolument, not regard for the public weal, had prompted many of them to in&s;i&s;t in this undertaking;&mdash;in furtherance of which they had carried about a &s;ub&s;cripti|on against importation, among the Merchants and Traders, &s;everal of whom they had either wheedled or frightened into their mea&s;ures; a&s;&s;uring all they applied to, that the plan was now generally adopted, and that it would be hurtful to them&s;elves, if they, and longer, with|&s;tood the opinion of the whole Community.</P>
<P>Here it ought to be ob&s;erved, that although many among them engaged from the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted motives, others &s;igned merely out of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">on, never having dealt in the ar|ticles they had agreed not to deal in, being in very different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of life; and &s;o making a merit of &s;igning, not to do, what they had never done before; and what &s;everals of them had neither opportunity nor inclination to do. The <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed" Leaders,</HI> however, pu&s;hed their project with all the artifices and machi|nations that &s;elf-intere&s;t could dictate to men, totally deadened to or devoid of, every principle of ju&s;tice:&mdash;And, at la&s;t they arrived to &s;uch a pitch of enormity, that, when &s;ome individu|als, who &s;olely depended on their trade for &s;upport, refu&s;ed to &s;tarve them&s;elves, while &s;ome of the principal of the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> even <HI>Committee-men,</HI> infringed the agreement in the gro&s;&s;est manner, and by importing largely, carried on their trade with &s;uperior advantages, the&s;e <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed&punc;"</HI> printed Adverti&s;ements, and circulated them through the whole country, painting the&s;e Refu&s;ers in the mo&s;t odious and malignant colours.</P>
<P>Unluckily for the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> in this li&s;t, they in&s;erted the name of a very peace|able man, one who was not a Merchant, and who had always clo&s;ely attended to his own bu&s;ine&s;s, without interfering with that of o|ther mens; now, as good natured folks are ge|nerally the wor&s;t to deal with when through|ly

provoked, this per&s;on had been &s;o a&s;&s;iduous in tracing their pa&s;t tran&s;actions as really to di&s;cover their whole de&s;ign: and was then en|tertaining the Public with an expo&s;ure of the conduct and hone&s;ty of <HI>the&s;e "well di&s;po&s;ed" Committee-men,</HI> who were now met together, for the purpo&s;e of replying to this very Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Our Travellers received from this occur|rence, a &s;ort of Tragi Comic entertainment; the mean eva&s;ions to which the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> re&s;orted, and the weak &s;ubterfuges, under which they attempted to conceal or &s;lur over the truth, frequently excited laughter, indig|nation and contempt: for when they &s;poke &s;ing|ly, they were as far from agreeing upon what was proper to be done, though they all agre|ed &s;omething ought to be done, as when they clamoured in concert.</P>
<P>Their Chairman, then, not being able to bring them to any con&s;i&s;tent re&s;olution, and never having depended much on his own ge|nius, even in writing <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed" Adver|ti&s;ements.</HI> becau&s;e he had ju&s;t &s;en&s;e enough to di&s;cover his own deficiency; and what is al&s;o part of the truth, he was, really and tru|ly, in other people's trammels, who goaded him which ever way they plea&s;ed; he at la&s;t thought fit to pull out of his pocket, a very long paper, which had been purpo&s;ely pre|pared for this occa&s;ion, by <HI>a &s;elect few of the particularly well di&s;po&s;ed,</HI> who very well knew that nothing pa&s;&s;able could be produced from the grave &s;olemn heads of the <HI>Committee;</HI> who&s;e appearance, at fir&s;t &s;ight, announced them to be men of <HI>Weight,</HI> without <HI>Importance.</HI> It is not to be doubted, but this paper was intro|duced with a very proper &s;peech from the Chair; indeed it might, with great ju&s;tice, he called, <HI>the My&s;tery of the "Well di&s;po&s;ed";</HI> and it is to be hoped, that by &s;ome chance or other, this My&s;tery may happen in time to be <HI>opened up.</HI></P>
<P>As it was read in an audible voice, para|graph by paragraph, commented and recom|mented upon, not with an intention to tell the truth, but very piou&s;ly to avoid it, our Travellers heard every word di&s;tinctly; the declared de&s;ign of <HI>this committee Meeting</HI> was to &s;hroud the truth, to throw a &s;pecious glo&s;s over their own behaviour, and to plea&s;e, at the &s;ame time, that they deluded the peo|ple. Neverthele&s;s, while we correct, let us be ju&s;t&mdash;One of the Committee, though a <HI>great offender,</HI> not being able to &s;mother the gnaw|ings of con&s;cience, often attempted to retire, but though the Monitor within, in &s;pite of the &s;upport of his Confederates around him, point|ed out the right path, he had not &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t their repeated in|treaties, or, to for&s;ake them, and leave them to their own devices.</P>
<P>But now let us rehear&s;e &s;ome part of their <HI>my&s;tical</HI> compo&s;ition,&mdash;It was mentioned in it, that there were <HI>few who had refu&s;ed to join them;</HI> yet in the cargo of the Pitt, Capt. Tap&s;cott, from Bri&s;tol, the very fir&s;t of the manife&s;ts publi&s;hed, they declared that <HI>of the</HI> 15, <HI>who were inhabitants of this town, only</HI> FOUR <HI>were &s;igners to the agreement.</HI>&mdash;It is &s;omething &s;urprizing, that &s;o <HI>many</HI> of the <HI>"few who had refu&s;ed to join,"</HI> &s;hould appear in the very fir&s;t Manife&s;t.</P>
<P>The Story &s;hall be &s;hortened for the pre&s;ent, becau&s;e it <HI>&s;hall</HI> figure more at large;&mdash;but the following quotations, which are &s;up|po&s;ed to approach nearly to the very words of the <HI>"Well di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> cannot be omitted, with any propriety. <Q><HI>Mr. Newell imported only tin and iron plates, which, although they were not in&s;erted in the agreement, yet at the time of entering into the &s;ame, it was generally under|&s;tood, that the importing of them would not be con&s;idered as breach of the agreement.</HI> Now it naturally occurs to the writers of this narra|tive, that it was certainly a very great pity, and <HI>probably</HI> a very great lo&s;s, to every <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> in this town, in this province, and in every other town on this continent, who had not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> as Mr. Newell.</Q></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> <DATE><HI>October</HI> 5<HI>th,</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MR. William Palfrey, Clerk to Mr. Han|cock having again attacked me in print, for publi&s;hing in the Chronicle, a piece from the Newport Mercury, &s;igned the AMERICAN SPY, on which account he charges me with in|con&s;i&s;tency, as I had often declared that I would take no notice of Anonymous publications;&mdash;Now, that publication was &s;ent from the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, Bo&s;ton, together with the an|&s;wer to what related to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, both which pieces were de&s;ired to be publi&s;hed, in order to contradict a fal&s;hood which had been a&s;&s;erted in the Bo&s;ton Gazette&mdash;that the mer|chants had applied to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and were refu&s;ed a &s;ight of the Cockets.&mdash;To make this plain, I even printed the <HI>Note</HI> in which the two pieces were inclo&s;ed, and Mr. William Palfrey mu&s;t have &s;een it clearly him&s;elf, but it did not &s;uit his purpo&s;e to repre&s;ent it in the true light.</P>
<P>What Mr. William Palfrey &s;ays of his ma&s;|ter, John Hancock, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> being &s;ingled out by me as a particular object of re&s;entment, mu&s;t appear untrue to every impartial man; he has hitherto only been a&s;ked the que&s;tion which all the owners of the other ve&s;&s;els have been a&s;ked.&mdash;Who paid the freight of the goods con&s;igned To Order?&mdash;They were called up|on
<PB N="93" REF="011336_0049_0F8580E21D412A90">
publickly, and it was the duty of every own|er to make the truth appear as far as he was able, that the public might not be deceived.</P>
<P>To make general charges of incon&s;i&s;tencies, mi&s;repre&s;entations and calumnies.&mdash;Impu|dence only is requi&s;ite:&mdash;but if any per&s;on, who&s;e name is mentioned in the Manife&s;ts pub|li&s;hed in this paper, chu&s;es to di&s;pute any ar|ticle, it &s;hall be authenticated in &s;uch a man|ner as to convince every candid Reader:&mdash;not one article that has been objected to as yet, by tho&s;e who have &s;igned their names, but has been proved by the mo&s;t inconte&s;tible evidence.</P>
<P>As, Mr. William Palfrey, if I am not much mi&s;taken, was Clerk at the Merchants meet|ings, I mu&s;t a&s;k him one que&s;tion.&mdash;Pray Mr. William Palfrey,&mdash;<HI>What are the names of the "Well Di&s;po&s;ed" Committee;&mdash;Are they the re&s;|pectable Committee of White-wa&s;hers?</HI>&mdash;This que&s;tion you &s;urely are able to an&s;wer; if, therefore, you &s;hould appear in print again, plea&s;e to an&s;wer it hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>The repeated attempts that are daily made to place this di&s;pute in a party light, fully di&s;play, as I have &s;aid before, the weakne&s;s of my opponents: if they had not in&s;erted my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in their Adverti&s;ement of Augu&s;t 14th, they might have gone on their way without interuption from me: after that pub|lication, no other choice was left, but to give my rea&s;ons for declining to &s;ign, to lay before the world a &s;tate of the importations, and to &s;how that the underhand behavior of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> did not agree with their declarations.</P>
<P>The <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> are advi&s;ed to reform before <HI>the Review of the proofs,</HI> and to make an open confe&s;&s;ion of their devices; they will never be able to ju&s;tify their conduct to the upright Mechants in this Town and Province, and to the neighbouring Colonies; I would therefore entreat them for their own &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of truth and ju&s;tice, to condemn all their pa&s;t unju&s;t proceedings, and fairly to &s;et out on a new, hone&s;t, and legal foun|dation.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bo&s;ton, <DATE><HI>October</HI> 9<HI>th,</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE taking into con&s;ideration the long Adverti&s;ement of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> pub|li&s;hed in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Gazette or Bo&s;ton Weekly News-Letter, Augu&s;t 31&s;t, has been delayed till this day, in expectation, that the applications, &s;o often, conferred on them, would have operated more effectually, and in|duced them, to appear under their own proper names: but, no ve&s;tige of hope remain|ing of their di&s;covering them&s;elves, I &s;hall now proceed to examine it.&mdash;The fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el publi&s;hed is the Snow Pitt, Capt. Tap&s;cott, from Bri&s;tol. which arrived here June 1&s;t, 1769, in which the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> &s;ay, there were <HI>thirty one Importers, &s;ixteen of whom did not belong here, and of the fifteen who were Inha|bitants of this Town, only four were &s;igners to the Agreement,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Me&s;&s;ieurs Newell, Rowe, Erving and Hubbards; Mr. Newell Imported only Tin and Iron Plates which altho' they were not in&s;erted in the Agreement, yet at the time of entering into the &s;ame, it was generally un|der&s;tood that the Importing of them would not be con&s;idered as a breach of the agreement; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

have &s;ince been permitted by on expre&s;s vote of the Merchants.</HI> It mu&s;t be plain to every per&s;on o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> common di&s;cernment, if it had been intended that the importation of Tin and Iron plates, would not be con&s;idered as a breach of the agreement, at the time of entering into the &s;ame in Augu&s;t 1768, they &s;hould have been adverti&s;ed along with the o|ther articles allowed: and it is, no doubt, mat|ter of grief to every man in the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Newell, that this affair &s;o <HI>generally under&s;tood</HI> as the <HI>"will di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> &s;ay, was not made public.&mdash;True, they permitted them by an expre&s;s vote, July 26th, but Mr. Newell's Tin and Iron Plates, unluckily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">rived here the fir&s;t of June preceding that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P>I mu&s;t a&s;k the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> it this gen|tleman was a Committee man to procure sub|&s;cribers to the Non-importation agreement, while he <HI>under&s;tood,</HI> even at the time the a|greement was come into, that they had given him a <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> which was not made public with the other allowed articles. I wi&s;h the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> joy on their exerci&s;ing a di&s;pen&s;ing power; though the world may think they have encroached on the prero|gative of his Holine&s;s at Rome.</P>
<P>Mr. ROWE <HI>imported only SHOT and LINES which were allowed.</HI> The Articles allowed are always printed in the &s;ame paper with the Manife&s;t to make this evident. <HI>The Blan|kets and Ho&s;e were con&s;igned to him for the u&s;e of the Army.</HI> It would not have been im|proper if the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> had mention|ed the Gentlemen of the Army, who gave the orders for the&s;e 12 bales of blankets, &amp;c. and to whom Mr. Rowe delivered them: Or, did <HI>you,</HI> the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> al&s;o grant Mr. Rowe, a <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> to import goods under the mark, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">MY<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for I have good rea&s;on to believe, that no &s;uch orders were given, nor the&s;e goods brought for the army, unle&s;s they thought proper to purcha&s;e them after they arrived here.</P>
<P>Mr. ERVING <HI>imported &s;ome Iri&s;h linen and Beer, which were &s;ent for before the agreement was come into, and actually countermanded, but his orders did not arrive in time to revert their being &s;hipped, and he has put them under the care of the Committee.</HI> So, the Iri&s;h linen and beer were ordered before the agree|ment in Augu&s;t 1768; yet the ca&s;es of beer were not &s;hipped at Bri&s;tol, till March 22<HI>d,</HI> nor the linen till the 10th of April, 1769; by this it would appear, that the let|ter commi&s;&s;ioning the&s;e articles, had been very long, indeed, in getting to Bri&s;tol, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well as the orders countermanding them.&mdash;Well! but now they are come, and <HI>he has put them under the care of the Committee&punc;</HI> pray how did <HI>you</HI> the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> them, and where did you &s;tore the&s;e packages?</P>
<P><HI>The goods for Me&s;&s;rs. Hubbards were only di|rected to their care, for Stephen Ayr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t, mer|chant at Newport.</HI> This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;hort, but di&s;|tinct account of Me&s;&s;rs. Hubbards goods, and as name and place are mentioned, leaves no room for doubt. I would compliment the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> on this occa&s;ion, for being &s;o explicit, a virtue they are not remarkable for; but it is probable, the public are more indebt|ed to the candour of the gentlemen to whom Mr. Ayrault's goods were con&s;igned, "than to the <HI>well di&s;po&s;ed."</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the &s;ix importations, that appeared in the manife&s;t, to come con&s;igned to one per&s;on, who&s;e name was blotted out, and others in&s;erted, tho&s;e who furni&s;hed Mr. Mein with this manife&s;t, mu&s;t have known, they were &s;hipped to Philadelphia, and the in&s;erting them in the manner he has done, is ba&s;e, and could be intended for no other purpo&s;e, than to impo&s;e on the Public, by in&s;inuating that tho&s;e goods were for &s;ome per&s;on or per&s;ons here, who&s;e names were &s;ecreted.</HI> Certainly, the per&s;on, who&s;e name was &s;o carefully blotted out, that it could not be read, ought openly and ho|ne&s;tly to have let the public know, who he was; as well as the time when and the ve&s;|&s;el, in which, the&s;e &s;ix importations, into this port, were &s;hipped for Philadelphia: If the per&s;on to whom the&s;e goods were con&s;igned, inclines to follow this plan, he will both do a

duty to him&s;elf and to the public. It was my duty to the public to mention the con|tents as expre&s;&s;ed in the Cockets: and to give the names which appeared in the manife&s;t, ju&s;t as they had been written and corrected in <HI>that</HI> &s;worn to by the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el. I give the importations from the coc|kets and manife&s;ts; it is every man's bu&s;ine&s;s concerned in the&s;e importations, to vindicate him&s;elf: the Committee ought not to have <HI>"&s;ecreted"</HI> either their own names, the name of that <HI>one per&s;on</HI> or tho&s;e of the other importers, <HI>To Order:</HI> Acting in this manner, is both underhand and <HI>"ba&s;e;"</HI> and they are now after many repeated calls, again &s;um|moned to di&s;cover them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the Brigantine La&s;t Attempt; Captain Lyde, which arrived in this port, April 10th 1769. The <HI>"will di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have a&s;&s;erted, <HI>there were no goods but what were allowed ex|cept one parcel of chee&s;e and ten boxes of Le|mons belonging to per&s;ons who were not &s;igners of the agreement.&mdash;nor were there any kind of good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the &s;igners, except Coals for Mr. Han|cock, and one ca&s;e and a matt, con&s;igned Mr. Leverett for the u&s;e of a Gentleman; family at Kittery.</HI> The <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> &s;hould not have <HI>"&s;ecreted"</HI> the names of the per&s;ons to whom the Chee&s;e and Lemons belonged,&mdash;The Public will be compleatly convinced of <HI>the gro&s;s fallacy and impudence</HI> of the <HI>well di&s;|po&s;ed,</HI> to u&s;e their own words, on comparing with the Manife&s;t publi&s;hed Augu&s;t, 21&s;t, their po&s;itive declaration that nothing contrary to a|greement was imported in this ve&s;&s;el, in which are to be &s;een no le&s;s than 167 ca&s;ks and barrels of gunpowder, con&s;igned to different per&s;ons, imported here April 10th, 1769; for the vote allowing it, did not pa&s;s till the 26th of July following.&mdash;Mr. Leverett, being a <HI>&s;igner,</HI> was very unfortunate in serving as a Conveyer for goods imported <HI>for the u&s;e of a Gentleman's family:</HI> goods not allowed, and imported for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, may, with greater propriety be accounted a breach of the non-importation agreement, than tho&s;e which nece&s;&s;ity dic|tates to bring for common &s;ale: Be&s;ides, this Gentleman will have the &s;ame excu&s;e to make more than once.</P>

<P>Captain DASHWOOD, <HI>a cask, containing &s;ome trifles he bought at Vendue in London, va|lue only</HI> 37<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI>&mdash;Captain Da&s;hwood in the Brigantine Deep-bay, arrived at Bo&s;ton, De|cember 3d, 1768, after a tedious pa&s;&s;age, hav|ving &s;ailed from London in September: It is very extraordinary, that HE &s;hould leave the&s;e <HI>trifles</HI> in London till April 1769, in&s;tead of bringing them with him in his own ve&s;&s;el.&mdash;There is &s;omething very arch in this tran&s;ac|tion of the Captain's, and the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have really vouch&s;afed to make a very &s;atisfac|tory apology for an under <HI>Committee man.</HI></P>
<P>MELATIAH BOURN, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q,</HI></ABBR> <HI>&s;ix Bundles of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">p, one of the allowed articles.</HI> The ar|ticles, allowed which are printed along with this manife&s;t, make it fully evident to every reader, that this Gentleman, is entirely clear from any imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tation of importing contrary to agreement: therefore the above need not have been mentioned by the <HI>well di&s;po&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is ob&s;erved by Mr. Mein that there were &s;ome articles taken from the cockets which were not in the manife&s;t, among the&s;e were</HI> 36 <HI>hampers of beer,</HI> 20 <HI>of which were really in&s;erted in the manife&s;t, con&s;igned E. Wendell of Port&s;mouth, and the remaining</HI> 16 <HI>were for &s;ea &s;tores&mdash;It is probable no notice would be taken of this but with intent to mi&s;repre&s;ent and abu&s;e Mr. Hancock, as the per&s;ons wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> furni&s;hed this manife&s;t mu&s;t have known by the cocket that the</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">00 <HI>pieces of gla&s;s, were really bottles of beer, part of which had been u&s;ed for &s;ea &s;tores, and the remainder were con&s;igned to the gentleman at Port&s;mouth aforementioned.</HI></P>
<P>Where our ingenious <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> di&s;|covered the 36 hampers of beer they be&s;t can tell; Capt. Wendell's 20 were in&s;erted, they grant; but the other &s;ixteen hampers being neither in the cockets, nor manife&s;t &s;urely could not be in&s;erted in the manife&s;t printed in the Chronicle: the 1300 pieces of green gla&s;s, weight, 22cwt. 2qr. 24lb. in packages marked J. H. were not publi&s;hed, with an in|tent, to mi&s;repre&s;ent or abu&s;e any per&s;on, and if they had contained beer, it would have been expre&s;&s;ed in the cocket: if this is con|te&s;ted by any of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> who chu&s;es of &s;ign his name, what is here &s;aid, &s;hall be properly authenticated.</P>
<P><HI>In the Chronicle of the</HI> 24<HI>th in&s;tant, is a very long manife&s;t of the carge by Capt. Calef, in which there appeared to be greater number of importers than in any of the other ve&s;&s;els, but no goods of a|ny con&s;equence beloning to any merchant here ex|cept one parcel con&s;igned to a per&s;on who has &s;ince &s;igned the agreement. The large number of pack|ages con&s;igned to order were for Capt. Oman, great part of which belonged to per&s;ons who have &s;ince al&s;o acceded to the agreement.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Among the importers in this ve&s;&s;el, only the following gentlemen were &s;igners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jonathan Ma&s;on, a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e. This was a
<PB N="103" REF="011336_0054_0F8580A56520A768">
pre&s;ent to a gentleman in Connecticut, and di|rected to his care.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. MASON, as the po&s;t chai&s;e was a pre|&s;ent directed to his care, cannot be con&s;ider|ed as an importer: but in our pre&s;ent days of &s;carcity and oeconomy, I hope the Gentleman to whom it was &s;ent, will convert it into ca&s;h, and give the produce to the poor.&mdash;It is with great plea&s;ure, I embrace this opportunity of doing ju&s;tice to Mr. Ma&s;on, and although I have examined the importations, in upwards of thirty ve&s;&s;els, his name has never appeared but in the above in&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Partridge,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">42 <HI>ells Ticklingburg, call|ed in the manife&s;t, narrow Germany.</HI></P>
<P>This Tickle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">burgh of Mr. Patridge's, was entered out by his corre&s;pondent, at the port of London, by the name of Narrow Germa|ny.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Handa&s;yd Peck,</HI> 60 <HI>dozen hatts The&s;e were wrote for the</HI> 7<HI>th of July</HI> 1768&punc; <HI>before the agreement was come into and expected in the fall and therefore not countermanded.</HI></P>
<P>The 60 dozen Felt Hats, though written for July 7th 1768, were not &s;hipped till Februa|ry 21&s;t, 1769: but this Gentleman has al&s;o to account for <HI>a ca&s;e of Haberda&s;hery,</HI> &s;hipped Fe|bruary 25th 1769, which is not even apologiz|ed for by the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed."</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Dennie,</HI> 1424 <HI>ells broad Ru&s;&s;ia Duck allowed.</HI></P>
<P>Called in the Manife&s;t, publi&s;hed in the Chronicle, broad Ru&s;&s;ia from the Cocket.</P>
<P><HI>J. Leverett, one box&mdash;directed to his care, for a Lady, at Kittery.</HI></P>
<P>Liable to the &s;ame great objection as the ca&s;e and the hou&s;ehold furniture.</P>
<P><HI>N. Green,</HI> 34 <HI>casks. This was pork &s;ent from hence and not meeting a &s;ale in London, was re|turned.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e 34 ca&s;ks are in the ma&s;ter's manife&s;t, but no contents mentioned, and tho&s;e was no cocket for them; Now if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ood at making conjurers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">dlet me into the my&s;teries of the art, I might not only have di&s;covered th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to have contained Pork, though the contents were not mention|ed in the manife&s;t, but might perhaps under their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ition, arrived at &s;uch proficiency as not only to delude many by a po&s;itive declaration, into a temporary belief without conde&s;cend|ing to proofs, or even without affixing a real name to that declaration, that every package landed in this town, &s;ince, the commencement of the Non-Importation agreement, or that may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nded during the continuance there|of, contained or &s;hall contain only ALLOW|ED ARTICLES.</P>
<P><HI>P. Hughes, Sundries for an apothecary, allow|ed to be imported as nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t from hence immediately &s;ee <HI>the "gro&s;s fallacy and impudence"</HI> of the <HI>well di&s;po&s;ed</HI> to u&s;e their own words: as <HI>&s;undries for an Apothecary,</HI> were, on April 19th they day Captain Calef entered here, as much prohibited by the Non importation agree|ment, as Tea, Gla&s;s, Painters Colours, Bibles, Paper or Scotch &s;nuff: Drugs and medicines were indeed allowed July 26th, but not be|fore: the very words, therefore, of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have again given the Public a compleat proof of their exerci&s;ing a di&s;|pen&s;ing power, without their having been ei|ther candid or hone&s;t enough to publi&s;h it for the benefit of the whole. Be&s;ide the Apothe|cary, there is a bag of Pepper which the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have carefully avoided men|tioning; and it is now left for them to in|form the public, whether it was <HI>generally un|der&s;tood</HI> at the time the agreement was &s;igned, that the importing <HI>pepper</HI> would not be con|&s;idered as a breach of the &s;ame, or if it was allowed by way of <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"I&s;aac Smith,&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tons hemp, allowed."</HI>&mdash;This is evidently &s;hewn by the li&s;t of allowed articles printed in the Chronicle.</P>
<P><HI>Cox and Berry, I bundle&mdash;containing maga|zines and pamphlets.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid above, it will pear plain to the Public, that what with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> under&s;tanding</HI> that &s;uch and &s;uch portations <HI>would not be con&s;idered as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="104" REF="011336_0055_0F8580A641ABFA80">
of the agreement,</HI> and what with allowing others <HI>"to be imported as nece&s;&s;ary,"</HI> though not in the <HI>public l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t</HI> of allowed articles, that the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have not only been liberal in <HI>di&s;pen&s;ations,</HI> but have di&s;played a great deal of meekne&s;s, charity and forgivene&s;s, to <HI>inattentive &s;igners.</HI></P>
<P>The reviewing the remaining part of the adverti&s;ement of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> mu&s;t be delayed till next publication.</P>
<P>I intimated to the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> &s;everal weeks ago, that their pre&s;ent cour&s;e, of di&s;ci|pline could not fail of having a very &s;alutary effect on their future conduct in life; and I now congratulate them on their &s;eeming re|&s;olution, &s;ince the arrival of Captain Bryant, to pay a &s;trict ob&s;ervance to their <HI>&s;olemn agreement,</HI> as well as on their alertne&s;s in compelling people to come in</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bo&s;ton, <DATE><HI>October</HI> 12<HI>th,</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN the la&s;t Chronicle having reviewed the apologies made by the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> in their Adverti&s;ement dated Augu&s;t 31&s;t, for the &s;igners who appeared to have received good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">y to agreement, by the Cockets and Manife&s;ts, &s;worn to by the Ma&s;ters of the Pitt, La&s;t Attempt, Lydia, Paoli, and London Packet, from which, the public will judge, if any per&s;ons, according to the phra&s;es of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have <HI>"perfidiou&s;ly departed from their &s;olemn agreement:"</HI> and whether or no, the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have acted with candour, and integrity, or with <HI>"gro&s;s fallacy, and im|pudence."</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to examine, the re|maining part of that Adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P><HI>In this Manife&s;t</HI> (the London Packet, Cap|tain C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) <HI>are &s;everal ca&s;ks called cordage, which contain cod lines for the fi&s;hery, and are allowed to be imported.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t 8 ca&s;ks called Cordage in the Cockets.</P>
<P><HI>This manife&s;t is &s;aid to be taken from the cockets&mdash;If &s;o, is there not an apparent de&s;ign to deceive the public, in omitting to mention the contents of the</HI> 34 <HI>casks of pork, con&s;igned Mr. Green, and the</HI> 26 <HI>casks of ditto, con&s;igned Mr. T. Gray? The contents of the&s;e casks were undoubt|edly mentioned in the cockets; and therefore might have been as ea&s;ily publi&s;hed, as the contents of other packages, if it would have an&s;wered the de&s;ign of the publi&s;her.</HI></P>
<P>It has been already declared there were no Cockets for the&s;e casks, and that the Ma&s;ter's Manife&s;t did not expre&s;s the Contents;&mdash;To explain which the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> are refer|red to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>It is worthy of remark that &s;everal packages con|&s;igned to order, and tho&s;e that are n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t directed either to order or any particular per&s;on in the manife&s;t, were imported by tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to come into the agreement, and &s;ome to others who have acceded to it &s;ince tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els arrived.</HI></P>
<P>Why did the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> in this Adver|ti&s;ement, <HI>&s;ecret</HI> the names of tho&s;e Impor|ters of &s;everal packages, e&s;pecially, as they had refu&s;ed to come into the agreement.&mdash;Let the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> print their whole li&s;t of Sub&s;cribers w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h the date of their &s;igning. It is to be hoped too, that the goods imported by tho&s;e who have acceded, &s;ince the arrival of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e ve&s;&s;els, are all lodged in the Committee's Store.</P>
<P><HI>Many of the con&s;ignments which appear to be for Bo&s;ton, were for per&s;ons that do not re&s;ide in the town or province.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> are entreated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> out the&s;e many con&s;ignments.</P>
<P><HI>The Box mark'd</HI> B. <HI>&s;aid to be in the Cockets, and to contain</HI> 90 <HI>pieces Cambrick, belong'd to a per&s;on unknown and was not called for when Captain Hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed, as the freight was only</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &amp; 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">. <HI>it is not probable it could con|tain &s;o many pieces of Cambrick.</HI></P>
<P>With the mark B. by two Cockets there ap|pear to be entered out at London, 90 pieces Demy Cambricks, and if the box does not contain &s;o many, it is the fault of the &s;hipper.</P>
<P><HI>In the&s;e five ve&s;&s;els, who&s;e manife&s;ts have been publi&s;hed, it may be ob&s;erved, that many of the Importers were per&s;ons out of trade who had on|ly a &s;ingle package for the u&s;e of their families, &s;ome were e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ergy-men who had a few books, one con&s;ignment was books, &amp;c. for the u&s;e of the college, another was pre&s;ents for the Indians, &s;ome packages were for the officers for the navy, &s;ome for officers of the Cu&s;toms, and others had &s;ome trifles which were all put in the manife&s;ts, to increa&s;e the number of packages and of Importers.</HI></P>

<P>On con&s;idering the above &s;tate of importa|tions from Great-Briti&s;h into Bo&s;ton, in <HI>only five ve&s;&s;els,</HI> amounting to upwards of Eleven Hundred Packages, more than <HI>eight hundred</HI> of which were for Gentlemen in the town, and many of the re&s;t, though con&s;igned To Order, can be prov|ed to have been received by the Merchants here; if the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> chu&s;e to di&s;pute it, and will &s;ign their names. It mu&s;t appear clear to every reader, that the SOME TRIFLES of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> when &s;tated impar|tially, are <HI>trifles</HI> of <HI>con&s;iderable value.</HI> And I again beg of them, to give one more proof of their genius, in explaining away the SOME TRIFLES brought in upwards of THIRTY VESSELS even excluding the above five, which have arrived in this port, from Great-Britain, be|tween January 1&s;t, and the date of their Ad|verti&s;ement Augu&s;t 31&s;t. 1769.</P>
<Q><P><HI>It is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to acquaint the reader, that the contents of many of the packages are very different from what they</HI> ARE SAID <HI>to contain in the manife&s;t publi&s;hed by Mr. Mein, particular|ly Ru&s;&s;ia and Engli&s;h duck are called Briti&s;h li|nens, &s;mall duck is called German linen, and Wool cards are called turnery, &amp;c.&mdash;whether the&s;e are really called &s;o in the cockets is under|tain, as the Merchants upon application made to the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Officers have not been per|mitted to &s;ee them, but</HI> we have rea&s;on to be|lieve <HI>they are publi&s;hed in this manner to de|ceive the public, the committee had all the mani|fe&s;ts before them, which they carefully examined and the public may depend on the accounts they have publi&s;hed relating to the &s;everal importa|tions.</HI></P></Q>
<P>With regard to Ru&s;&s;ia and Engli&s;h Duck, being called Briti&s;h linen, that has been fully cleared up, on my &s;ide, by an atte&s;ted cocket<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and as to the other articles, if the corre&s;pon|dents of &s;ome people here chu&s;e to make fal&s;e entries, the blame mu&s;t fall upon them&s;elves. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">uppo&s;e a certain Gentleman does not want to hear any thing more about <HI>Wool Cards</HI> or <HI>Turnery.</HI></P>
<P>The Public will now be &s;en&s;ible there is great <HI>"rea&s;on to believe"</HI> that the long Adverti&s;e|ment of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> was publi&s;hed with an intention to <HI>deceive,</HI> more &s;o, as they have declared they <Q><HI>had all the Manife&s;ts be|fore them, which they carefully examined.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Of what is &s;aid concerning the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> I am authori&s;ed to declare, that, if the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> will conde&s;cend to mention when the Merchants, as they call them&s;elves, made application, and were refu&s;ed, and, at the &s;ame time, will &s;ign their names to their publication&mdash;The Gentleman who &s;ent the note to me, which was publi&s;hed in the Chronicle of September the 8th, will, im|mediately after, make known his name: and then, what the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have a&s;&s;erted above, will be proved, to u&s;e their own &s;tile, <HI>Fal&s;e.</HI>&mdash;This too, will &s;erve as an an&s;wer to Mr. William Palfrey, who has fallen into the gro&s;s ab&s;urdity of <HI>whi&s;pering</HI> in a News-paper; a whi&s;per is a private intimation, uttered on|ly to the per&s;on to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed, in a low &s;oft voice.</P>
<Q><P><HI>It will therefore be needle&s;s, particularly to remark upon every manife&s;t that may be publi&s;hed, but if any thing worthy of ob&s;ervati|on appears in the cour&s;e of Mr. Mein's publicati|ons, it will be properly noticed and explained, and if needful animadverted upon.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Our <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed" Veterans in Deceit,</HI> from the above paragraph, appear now very wil|ling to be &s;ilent, and if they had adopted &s;uch a wi&s;e re&s;olution before they publi&s;hed the Adverti&s;ement under review, they would have &s;hewn much prudence, for then, they would not have made public Deacon Newell's di&s;pen&s;ation; Mr. Rowe's importations under the mark ARMY;&mdash;Mr. George Erving's

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bo&s;ton, <DATE><HI>October</HI> 15<HI>th,</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE long Adverti&s;ement of the <HI>"well di&s;|po&s;ed"</HI> publi&s;hed in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Gazette, Augu&s;t 31&s;t, having been expo&s;ed to public view in the two la&s;t Chronicles&mdash;the Manife&s;t and Contents of the Packages, im|ported in the Na&s;&s;au, Capt. Smith, which en|tered here Augu&s;t 15th, is now laid before the Public; the rea&s;on for altering the mode of publication with regard to this ve&s;&s;el, was the great difficulty found to reconcile the Ma|nife&s;t with the cockets on comparing them; It was therefore thought be&s;t, that mi&s;takes might be avoided, to print both, and by &s;o do|ing, &s;ubmit the whole to the penetration of the Reader. The &s;ummary and ingenious ac|count given of this Cargo by the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;|ed,"</HI> is as follows: <HI>Bo&s;ton, Aug.</HI> 28<HI>th.</HI> 1769.</P>
<P>THE Committee appointed to examine the Manife&s;ts of the Goods imported in the ve&s;&s;els lately arrived from England, having carefully examined the Manife&s;t of the Car|go of the Brigantine Na&s;sau, Capt. Smith, hereby inform the public, that all the goods imported in &s;aid ve&s;&s;el contrary to the A|greement of the Merchants belonging to the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton and Charle&s;town have been delivered up to the Committee, and put into the Stores provided for that purpo&s;e ex|cept &s;ix Che&s;ts of Oil, and twenty-one Casks of Figgs and Rai&s;ins, marked E. K. the Or|ders, for which had been countermanded by the per&s;on to whom they were con&s;igned, and
<PB N="120" REF="011336_0063_0F8580ACB14B7220">
the &s;everal packages con&s;igned Me&s;&s;ieurs&mdash;. who have been and are now adverti&s;ed as Im|porters.</P>
<P>The <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> are begged to inform the Public, if Mr. Thomas Ru&s;&s;el of Charle&s;|town, is a Signer: and as they have <HI>careful|ly examined the Manife&s;t</HI> it is wi&s;hed they would name the Committee to whom <HI>all the Goods imported in &s;aid ve&s;&s;el contrary to a|greement</HI> have been delivered; and hav|ing &s;aid, the&s;e Goods were <HI>put into &s;tores provided for that purpo&s;e,</HI> it would not be a|mi&s;s, to point out in what part of Bo&s;ton or Charle&s;town, the&s;e Stores are &s;ituated. Or, were they the very Stores of the gentle|men to whom the Goods were con&s;igned? Are the Packages &s;till unopened? Are the Goods yet un&s;old?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Manife&s;ts of the ve&s;&s;els which arrived between January 1&s;t, and Augu&s;t 31&s;t, 1769, the date of the vindication of the <HI>well di&s;po&s;ed</HI> being now publi&s;hed, it may be conceived, that the public are expecting the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> will make another laudable effort in their own defence, or will they to bo|row a choice word of theirs, &s;helter them&s;elves under a general denial, commonly the der|nier re&s;ort of detected <HI>"Impudence."</HI></P>
<P>However, if they &s;hould mu&s;ter bra&s;s e|nough to re-appear, which &s;eems to be a never failing re&s;ource with them on all emergen|cies; their friends ought to be&s;eech them care|fully to con&s;ult their own <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> Ad|verti&s;ement of Augu&s;t 11th, from whence their pre&s;ent &s;elf-a&s;&s;umed title originated, and which I have too much re&s;pect for them to withold on any occa&s;ion: They ought to read the fir&s;t line&mdash;
<Q><HI>"Whereas</HI> ALL <HI>the Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI></Q>
and immediately after turn to the Review of their Adverti&s;ement Augu&s;t 31&s;t, in which, they will &s;ee, three &s;everal li&s;ts of Non-&s;ign|ers, among whom, are many of the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable Gentlemen in the province.</P>
<P>A definition of the Words <HI>"Well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> given by the <HI>Precious Set</HI> them&s;elves certainly would be very entertaining.</P>
<P>And it would indeed be kind in the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> to give the Public a li&s;t of the great and good Qualities requi&s;ite to entitle a Candidate to the mighty honour of &s;uch an appellation; and in my humble opinion, the be&s;t plan to adopt, would be for the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> to publi&s;h their Names, that the world might look up or more properly down, and take example.</P>
<P>Al&s;o before they proceed to the con&s;idera|tion of the other Thirty Ve&s;&s;els, which arrived preceding the 31&s;t of Augu&s;t and the large importations by them, it would not be improper for them &s;oberly to reflect on what has been publi&s;hed concerning The fir&s;t Five, which brought upwards of Eleven Hundred Packages for this town, after excluding the <HI>Goods</HI> for <HI>other Provinces,</HI> and every part of this Pro|vince, except Bo&s;ton; al&s;o the <HI>allo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Goods</HI> of Signers, tho&s;e for <HI>Family U&s;e,</HI> and tho&s;e e|ven brought under the <HI>indulgencies</HI> granted by the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed."</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECOND PART of the CATECHISM of the "WELL DISPOSED." inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ome whole&s;ome Advice.</HEAD>
<P>Pray how have you managed with your new recruits?</P>
<P>Are all the goods imported &s;ince January
<PB N="121" REF="011336_0063_0F8580ACB14B7220">
1&s;t, contrary to agreement, hone&s;tly lodged in your &s;tores?</P>
<P>Do you imagine that your new acqui&s;itions have imbibed all your principles, have really con&s;olidated with you, or will they &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity to de&s;ert?</P>
<P>What are your terms of enli&s;ting? it's thought you have different encouragements &s;uited to the di&s;po&s;ition of your Recruits.</P>
<P>Are not &s;ome, after having largely &s;upplied them&s;elves, allowed to keep all the goods they have imported, provided they come in?</P>
<P>Have you not prevailed on a few, on ac|count of the &s;hortne&s;s of time till January 1770?</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, when you can prevail upon a new Recruit to give up his Goods, you take them into your cu&s;tody; but is it not al&s;o true, that you &s;ometimes give them back again?</P>
<P>Did you ever allow delinquent Signers to keep their Goods in their own Store, on pro|mi&s;e not to open them?</P>
<P>Were not others permitted to carry the Packages to their own Store, open, and &s;ell them, <HI>after having performed the ceremony of &s;ubmitting them to the direction of the Committee.</HI></P>
<P>And when every other encouragement pro|ved abortive, did not a bountiful application of <HI>&s;trong &s;cented aromatics,</HI> in part, occa&s;ion the de&s;ired effect?</P>
<P>Pray was this <HI>natural di&s;covery,</HI> the &s;pontane|ous production of a &s;ingle genius among, you, the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed;"</HI> or did the idea a&s;cend, and diffu&s;e it&s;elf univer&s;ally among you from the <HI>retrograde colli&s;ions</HI> of certain well known parts, where it is &s;aid, honour chiefly re&s;ides.</P>
<P>Had you an unanimous vote for it, at your <HI>private meetings?</HI> did each of you according to the &s;trength of his zeal, proportion the <HI>quantity</HI> and <HI>quality</HI> of his <HI>contribution?</HI>&mdash;did not each of you, for that purpo&s;e, come properly charged? or upon in&s;pection, find|ing the collection of matter too &s;mall, not with&s;tanding you were &s;o <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> did you, to &s;upply the deficiency, &s;end about a &s;ub|&s;cription for to multiply the do&s;e? And pray, which of the <HI>Committees</HI> were deputed to per|form the &s;avoury operation?</P>
<P>But if a &s;econd application &s;hould be tried, perhaps the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">worthies who admini&s;ter it, may meet with a gracious reception, and re|ceive a weightier compliment, in return, though perhaps, one, not to &s;weetly perfumed.</P>
<P>It has been whi&s;pered about, that you have generou&s;ly given up &s;ome goods that were re|ally once in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with this remark|able &s;aying, <HI>You know we are never hard upon Signers.</HI> This, the Public have long &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The Public have al&s;o had good rea&s;on to believe, that &s;ome of you, the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> have been and now are among the greate&s;t de|linquents.</P>
<P>May <HI>Scotch Snuff</HI> be imported with impunity by any of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed."</HI></P>
<P>Would not the life and conver&s;ation of &s;ome of you, the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> if held up to public view in their true colour, pre&s;ent an ex|ample, tending greatly to the edification of mankind.</P>
<P>Cannot the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> give the Pub|lic a li&s;t of of &s;undries imported under the de|nomination, <HI>Turnery?</HI></P>
<P>Is it not certain, that you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> know the names of Importers, To Order, &s;ome of whom have not &s;igned, and who&s;e names you have <HI>"&s;ecreted."</HI></P>
<P>Did a very good Chri&s;tian, ever attempt to per&s;uade a Merchant not to fell <HI>Bibles,</HI> as be|ing contrary to the good of the country?</P>
<P>Was a certain in Chairman ever told, when re|peatedly pre&s;&s;ing a per&s;on, who was not a Merchant, to &s;ign, that he &s;hould begin to think &s;eriou&s;ly of it, when he, the &s;aid Chair|man, made a motion from the Chair, to &s;top the importation of Mola&s;&s;es, from which the greate&s;t revenue was drawn?</P>
<P>Did that Gentleman ever make &s;uch a mo|tion?</P>
<P>Did he ever con&s;ult a certain per&s;on about writing a <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> Adverti&s;ement, after being told, that the fir&s;t and la&s;t part of the one be had produced, in writing, contradicted each other.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="011336_0064_0F8580ACDF6C7EA0">
Was he not told, that if he meant to pub|li&s;h the truth, he had no occa&s;ion to con&s;ult any per&s;on? but that not being altogether the point in view, Was he not recomended back to the Committee for their &s;age a&s;&s;i&s;tance? After having by him&s;elf, thrice, in vain, attempted to write &s;ome thing that would hang together? However it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, after retir|ing for a day or two, he produced one, which, if not very con&s;i&s;tent with truth, was at lea&s;t nicely fitted for pre&s;ent u&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Gentleman, &s;everal months ago, once &s;aying that if a certain per&s;on &s;tood out, he mu&s;t be adverti&s;ed; did not that per&s;on repeat an Adverti&s;ement to him, extempore, which made him &s;tart and &s;hake his ears?</P>
<P>Are the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> ignorant, that e|ven &s;igners, have &s;old great quantities of Goods Imported &s;ince the Agreement was entered into?</P>
<P>Have any of the <HI>&s;ix inattentive &s;igners,</HI> of|fended more than once?</P>
<P>Do the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> think the public is ignorant, that one of their number, and a Committee-man too, has been a great tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or, though the &s;igns of grace, which he &s;hewed on a late occa&s;ion, entituled him to &s;ome mercy.</P>
<P>How many of the Sub&s;cribers to the Agree|ment were never any way concerned in im|porting Briti&s;h Goods?</P>
<P>At your next meeting, pray exclude all <HI>&s;uch,</HI> even though the Chair &s;hould be vaca|ted, and follow a more equitable plan than you have hitherto done?</P>
<P>Would it not be an excellent manoeuvre, on the 1&s;t of January next, to propo&s;e giving up the Goods you may have in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in or|der to engage the &s;igners, to prolong the term of their Agreement?&mdash;Other Goods you know might be ordered to arrive about the expiration of this &s;econd Agreement, e&s;peci|ally if the time &s;hould only be &s;ix months, and then delivering up the&s;e new goods, might again &s;erve as a bait to encourage Signers to lengthen the Agreement to the end of the year. Are not the&s;e clever expedi|ents for you!</P>
<P>The <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> are al&s;o asked, if they have not piou&s;ly u&s;ed all their endeavours, to &s;top the circulation of a certain pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> through the country, by influencing the people at the different hou&s;es where the papers u&s;ed to be left, to refu&s;e taking them in&punc;</P>
<P>Have they not al&s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ent to al|mo&s;t every town in the province for the &s;ame and for <HI>other "well di&s;po&s;ed" purpo&s;es?</HI> though &s;ome Gentlemen in the country, have been &s;o anxious to enquire into, and to propagate the truth, as to point out new methods of con|veying the <HI>papers</HI> with &s;afety.</P>
<P>Do &s;ome Signers retain the privilege of <HI>inattention,</HI> or of digre&s;&s;ing and varying from the <HI>allowed</HI> articles as they plea&s;e: and do the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed'</HI> &s;till u&s;e the Anti chri&s;tian freedom of granting di&s;pen&s;ations and indul|gencies?</P>
<P>The <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed,"</HI> with their u&s;ual con|fidence, may declare, they de&s;pi&s;e an&s;wering the&s;e interrogatories, but the Public will judge with more ju&s;tice, and conceive it to be incapacity that prevents them.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have not yet told the Public their Names, opportuni|ties have offered of lu&s;tily pulling their ears, which have often appeared, with affected briskne&s;s, through the gloom that &s;urrounded them; as well as of be&s;tow|ing repeated applications, which have had a very Prolific effect, on another part, that &s;hall be namele&s;s.</P>
<P>Before you, the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> proceed further in your gradation downwards, it would perhaps be conducive to your future peace, &s;eriou&s;ly to examine your pa&s;t lives, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f you think the <HI>hue</HI> of your actions fair e|nough to &s;uffer the light, you may go on, but perhaps you may bear about in your minds for life, the mortifying and cutting remem|brance of having &s;lighted this advice.</P>

<HEAD>Catechi&s;m OF THE "WELL DISPOSED". PART III.</HEAD>
<P>DID not a certain Committee the la&s;t &s;pring declare, that goods for &s;hip building were not meant to be included in the Non-impor|tation agreement?</P>
<P>In direct oppo&s;ition to this, have not a ve|ry <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> Committee lately a&s;&s;erted, that the above mentioned Committee had no right to make &s;uch a declaration, that goods for &s;hip-building were as much excluded as any other article whatever, and that Gentlemen concerned in that branch of trade, ought to inform their corre&s;pondents at home, not to &s;end goods for &s;uch a purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>Which of the&s;e Committees are to be believ|ed?&mdash;Why do the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> conceal <HI>a|ny</HI> of their tran&s;actions or re&s;olves! Why are they not publi&s;hed for the information of this town, province and continent?</P>
<P>Is not the building of &s;hips a very great be|nefit to the trade&s;men in this town?</P>
<P>Have not the trade&s;men in this town, been principally &s;upported for &s;ome years pa&s;t, by the building of &s;hips for the Merchants of Great Britain?</P>
<P>Will not the prohibition of the&s;e articles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">end to the almo&s;t immediate ruin of that in|du&s;trious and valuable part of the communi|ty?</P>
<P>Were they in a matter that &s;o nearly con|cerned their intere&s;t, and the &s;upport of their families, advi&s;ed with and con&s;ulted?</P>
<P>Was a vote, prohibiting &s;uch goods, ever pa&s;&s;ed at any of the Merchants meetings?</P>
<P>Or did the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> Committee that went about recruiting, dare to arrogate to them&s;elves &s;uch a &s;upreme command over the bread of others, earned with the &s;weet of the brow, as of their own mere motion, to &s;top up the channel from whence it flowed; while they them&s;elves fattened in ca&s;e and plenty?</P>
<P>Will any of the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> part with his <HI>red Cloak</HI> and <HI>be&s;t white Wig,</HI> to &s;upport a family in di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>Or, for that humane purpo&s;e, will they part with the additional advance they have laid on their goods &s;ince the commencement of the non-importation agreement?</P>
<P>Have the other &s;ea-port towns in this pro|vince, &s;topt the importation of goods for &s;hip-building?</P>
<P>Will not &s;uch re&s;olutions force that valuable trade into other channels, or oblige the Bri|ti&s;h Merchants to build their ve&s;&s;els at home?</P>
<P>How many di&s;pen&s;ations have the <HI>Well Di&s;po&s;ed</HI> granted for the importation of <HI>I|ri&s;h linen from England?</HI></P>
<P>Are the Merchants who import goods for building, entitled to di&s;pen&s;ations; Or, are the <HI>"Well Di&s;po&s;ed" a&s;hamed</HI> of any longer encroaching on the a&s;&s;umed unchri&s;tian pri|vileges of the Whore of Babylon?</P>
<P>At a late meeting, was there any <HI>new a|greement</HI> propo&s;ed?&mdash;Was there a vote pa&s;|&s;ed, not to import till all the Revenue acts were repealed, and even the <HI>Mola&s;&s;es act?</HI></P>
<P>Was there a large company pre&s;ent when a certain vote pa&s;&s;ed? or, only between <HI>twenty</HI> and <HI>thirty?</HI></P>
<P>Let us call them <HI>Thirty!</HI> Were they unani|mous?</P>
<P>When the Gentlemen pre&s;ent were called to &s;ign, did the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;igner, a worthy deacon, and a very warm &s;upporter of the &s;cheme, &s;ay, with the pen in his hand, that he was a|&s;hamed
<PB N="126" REF="011336_0066_0F8580AE62DCA308">
to put down his name, on account of the <HI>&s;mall number</HI> of his followers?</P>
<P>Did the <HI>principal Orator</HI> in favour of it, prudently decline &s;igning, &s;aying for excu&s;e, it was well known he did not import any of the prohibited articles?</P>
<P>Have not <HI>&s;everal people</HI> &s;igned, on being granted the trifling di&s;pen&s;ation of importing every article requi&s;ite for carrying on their own branch of bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P>How many &s;igned this <HI>new Agreement</HI> at the meeting?&mdash;<HI>Were they twenty.</HI></P>
<P>If a few of the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> have taken into their wi&s;e con&s;ideration, the repeal of the mola&s;&s;es duty, why, to &s;trengthen that re&s;olution, do they not al&s;o vote again&s;t their importation, for it mola&s;&s;es are not imported, no revenue can be drawn from them?</P>
<P>Pray how many REBUFFS have you, the <HI>well di&s;po&s;ed</HI> met with, from former PENITENTS?</P>
<P>Have <HI>you</HI> ever waited upon any refractory Committee-Men?</P>
<P>Did you ever chu&s;e a Committee-Man who was not a &s;igner?</P>
<P>Do the Public begin to &s;u&s;pect, that a cer|tain &s;cheme, is principally calculated to <HI>cru&s;h</HI> all the young Merchants and importers, that the trade may &s;till remain in the hands of <HI>a few grave "well di&s;po&s;ed" Dons,</HI> who are be|lieved to be <HI>exceedingly well</HI> &s;tocked with Goods?</P>
<P>Has not the cour&s;e of di&s;cipline, which the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed."</HI> have undergone for the&s;e two months pa&s;t, and the advice that has been be|&s;towed on them, opened the eyes of the Pub|lic, to &s;ee them in their <HI>true colours?</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>"well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> a few days ago, <HI>white-wa&s;hed</HI> &s;ome importers, they &s;urely di&s;|played much <HI>"Want of breeding"</HI> in <HI>&s;ecreting</HI> their own Names.</P>
<P>From whence does this <HI>"want of breeding"</HI> ari&s;e?&mdash;Is it the effect of &s;ingular mode&s;|ty of fear?</P>
<P>Pray what is become of the <HI>alert</HI> Committee, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>&s;even "well di&s;po&s;ed"</HI> Gentle|men, who were to report on the manife&s;ts of the ve&s;&s;els as they arrived?</P>
<P>Did one of the&s;e <HI>&s;even Worthies,</HI> who is an excellent <HI>Prompter</HI> behind the curtain prudently on a late occa&s;ion, procure another Gentleman to put down his name in his place; or did he previou&s;ly re&s;ign?</P>
<P>Why don't they lay before the public, their <HI>"True Account"</HI> of the cargo of the Brigantine Wolfe, Capt. Bryant, which was entered here, <HI>the third,</HI> and their <HI>"True Account"</HI> of the cargo of the &s;hip Thomas, Capt. Davies, al&s;o entered here the 12th <HI>of this month?</HI></P>
