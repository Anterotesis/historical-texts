<HEAD>THE TESTIMONY OF THE Monthly-Meeting of Friends IN <HI>PHILADELPHIA,</HI> Concerning our Antient, Worthy FRIEND, <HI>THOMAS CHALKLEY,</HI> Decea&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian Experiences of the Faithful being u&s;eful to direct &s;uch as are de&s;irous of following them in the Paths of true Religion and Virtue, and their good Examples &s;hining
<PB N="vi" REF="006297_0004_10285604A6B30350">
with the greate&s;t Clearne&s;s, when they have, with the Fle&s;h, put off all human Infirmities; Ju&s;tice to their Memory, and a Concern for the Benefit of their Survi|vors, demand our grateful Remembrance of them, and the contributing our En|deavours to render their Labours u&s;eful to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations engage us to pre|face the Writings of this our e&s;teemed Friend and Elder in the Truth, with this Te&s;timony concerning him.</P>
<P>He was a Member of our Monthly-Meeting above Forty Years, &s;o that &s;ome of us had Opportunities of being inti|mately acquainted with him; and of knowing his Fidelity and Diligence in promoting the Cau&s;e of Truth, and the Edification of the Church of Chri&s;t; this having been the principal Engage|ment and Concern of his Mind, and which he preferred to any other Con&s;i|deration; as will evidently appear to tho&s;e, who, with an hone&s;t and unpre|judiced Intention, peru&s;e his Journal of his Life and Travels.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="006297_0005_1028560786A47850">By this it will appear, that He was, in the early Part of his Life, &s;en&s;ibly affect|ed with the Vi&s;itation of Divine Life and Grace, and, by adhering thereunto, was pre&s;erved from the Vanities and Follies, which often divert and alienate the Minds of Youth from the due Remembrance and awful Regard of their Creator; &s;o that he was enabled to bear a Te&s;timony of Chri&s;tian Patience and Self-Denial in his youthful Days, and, by keeping un|der that Exerci&s;e, as he advanced in Years, attained to further Knowledge and Experience in the Work of Religion, in which he had a Sight of the Nece&s;&s;ity of keeping in a State of Humility, and of bearing the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, which mor|tified him to the World; &s;o that the Lo&s;s many &s;u&s;tain by the anxious Pur&s;uit of the lawful Things thereof appearing to him, He was concerned to avoid it, and in Obedience to the Precept of Chri&s;t, to <HI>&s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> having Faith in his Pro|mi&s;e, <HI>that all the&s;e Things</HI> (nece&s;&s;ary for him) <HI>&s;hould be added.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="006297_0006_102856090D887270">Thus the Love of God influencing his Mind, and opening his Under&s;tanding, he became concerned for the general Good of Mankind, and received a Gift of the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, before he had attained the Age of Twen|ty-one Years; in the publick Exerci&s;e of which, He &s;oon after travelled thro' many Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the next Year, being 1697, He came to vi&s;it Friends in this and the adjacent Pro|vinces of <HI>America,</HI> where his Mini&s;try and Conver&s;ation were to the Comfort and Edification of the Faithful (as &s;ome of us can with Satisfaction declare, from our Knowledge and Remembrance of him at that Time) and the near Fellow&s;hip and Union he then had with Friends here (we believe) contributed to his more &s;peedy Determination of &s;ettling among us, which He afterwards thought it his Duty to do, tho' the leaving his Parents and Relations (as He afterwards expre&s;&s;ed) was no &s;mall Cro&s;s to him, being of a dutiful and affectionate Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>After fixing his Re&s;idence among us, He per&s;ever'd in his Concern and Labour
<PB N="ix" REF="006297_0007_1028560BB3ADACE0">
for the Edification of the Churches, and gathering People to Faith and Depen|dance on the inward Teachings of Chri&s;t, and for that Purpo&s;e only He travelled many long Journies and Voyages through the &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies on this Con|tinent, and mo&s;t of the I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and in <HI>Europe,</HI> through <HI>England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Hol|land, Frizeland,</HI> and &s;everal Parts of <HI>Germany, and the adjacent Northern Kingdoms</HI>; and in many of the&s;e Places his Mini&s;try and religious Labours were ble&s;&s;ed with the de&s;ired Succe&s;s, of which there are yet &s;ome Witne&s;&s;es living, and others, who were convinced of the Prin|ciples of Truth by his Means, became &s;erviceable Members of the Church, and continued therein to the End of their Lives.</P>
<P>But as the wi&s;e King <HI>Solomon</HI> formerly ob&s;erved, that <HI>One Event cometh to the Righteous, and to the Wicked,</HI> &s;o it hap|pened to this good Man, who met with various Lo&s;&s;es and Di&s;appointments in his temporal E&s;tate; after which, the Cir|cum&s;tances of his Affairs engaged him to
<PB N="x" REF="006297_0008_1028560ECDE023A8">
undertake &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s, in the Manage|ment of which He was obliged to cro&s;s the Seas frequently: This, however, did not abate his Zeal and religious Care to make u&s;e of all Opportunities of vi&s;iting the Meetings of Friends when among them, and of calling, at other times, to &s;uch who might be accounted as <HI>the Out|ca&s;t of I&s;rael, and the Di&s;per&s;ed of Ju|dah, or as Sheep not yet of the Fold of Chri&s;t</HI>; and his Services of that Kind are worthy to be commemorated, having been often productive of good Effects.</P>
<P>His Patience was remarkable in Di&s;ap|pointments and Afflictions, of which He had a large Share; and his Meekne&s;s, Humility and Circum&s;pection, in the ge|neral Cour&s;e of his Life and Conver&s;a|tion, were con&s;picuous and exemplary; and as He frequently exhorted and admo|ni&s;hed others to the Ob&s;ervation and Practice of the many excellent Precepts and Rules of Chri&s;t, our Lord and Law-giver, and more e&s;pecially tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in his Sermon on the Mount (which con|tains the Sum of our moral and religious Duties) &s;o He manife&s;ted him&s;elf to be
<PB N="xi" REF="006297_0009_102856119CE969B8">
one of that Number, whom Chri&s;t com|pared to the wi&s;e Builder, who laid a &s;ure Foundation; &s;o that his Building &s;tood un&s;haken by the various Floods and Winds of Tribulations and Temptations he met with, both from within and without.</P>
<P>He was a Lover of Unity among&s;t Bre|thren, and careful to promote and maintain it, &s;hewing the Example of a meek, cour|teous, and loving Deportment, not only to Friends, but to all others, with whom he had Conver&s;ation or Dealings; &s;o that it may be truly &s;aid, That <HI>few have lived &s;o univer&s;ally beloved and re&s;pected among us:</HI> And it was manife&s;t this did not pro|ceed from a De&s;ire of being popular, or to be &s;een of Man: For his Love and Re|gard to Peace did not divert him from the Di&s;charge of his Duty in a faithful Te|&s;timony to tho&s;e that profe&s;&s;ed the Truth, that they ought to be careful to maintain good Works; and He was often concern'd zealou&s;ly to incite and pre&s;s Friends to the Exerci&s;e of the good Order and Di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Wi&s;dom of Truth, by admoni&s;hing, warning, and timely treating with &s;uch as fell &s;hort of
<PB N="xii" REF="006297_0010_10285614C996D580">
their Duty therein, and by te&s;tifying a|gain&s;t tho&s;e who, after loving and bro|therly Care and Endeavours, could not be brought to the Sen&s;e and Practice of their Duty; and thereby He &s;ometimes &s;har'd the Ill-will and Re&s;entment of &s;uch Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The &s;everal E&s;&s;ays He wrote on religi|ous Subjects at Sea, are further Proofs that his Mind was principally engaged in the great Bu&s;ine&s;s and Concern of Reli|gion; and as He continued under the &s;ame Engagement to the End, we are fully per&s;uaded the Words with which He concluded his la&s;t publick Te&s;timony on the I&s;land of <HI>Tortola,</HI> may be truly and properly applied to him, <HI>That he had fought a good Fight, and had kept the Faith, and,</HI> we doubt not, <HI>he now enjoys a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Much more might be truly &s;aid of his Integrity, Faithfulne&s;s and Worth, but we do not think it nece&s;&s;ary; our chief Intention being to expre&s;s our re&s;pectful Remembrance of him, and our Unity with his Labours and Services, and in or|der to a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e, to whom he was not
<PB N="xiii" REF="006297_0011_102856198ABD11B8">
per&s;onally known, of the Truth of what He has him&s;elf wrote of his Life and Travels; for we believe, as He was a Man &s;ignally influenced with the Spirit of u|niver&s;al Love and Good-will to Mankind, this was his chief Motive for writing; and we are &s;incerely de&s;irous that his good De&s;ign may be an&s;wered, and that the Glory of every good and perfect Work may be attributed to that Divine Power alone, which can qualify others to &s;upply the Places of tho&s;e faithful Mini|&s;ters and Servants of Chri&s;t, who have been of late Years removed from among us, and are of that Number, of whom it is written, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead, which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI></P>

<P>HAVING great Cau&s;e to acknowledge the Re|gard and Protection of Divine Providence in the &s;everal Stages of my Life, I think it may be of Service to others to leave behind me the following Ac|count of my Life and Travels.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>I WAS born on the Third Day of the Third Month 1675, in <HI>Southwark,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1675.</NOTE> and de&s;cended of hone&s;t and religious Parents, who were very careful of me, and brought me up in the Fear of the Lord; and oftentimes coun&s;elled me to Sobriety, and reproved me for Wantonne&s;s; and that light Spirit, which is incident to Youth, they were careful to nip it in the Bud: So that I have Cau&s;e to ble&s;s God, through Chri&s;t, on the Behalf of my tender Parents.</P>
<P>And I may not forget the Dealings of God with me in my very tender Years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1684.</NOTE> When between eight and
<PB N="2" REF="006297_0015_10285625502168E8">
ten Years of Age, my Father and Mother &s;ent me near two Miles to School, to <HI>Richard Scoryer</HI> in the Suburbs of <HI>London.</HI> I went mo&s;tly by my &s;elf to the School; and many and various were the Exerci&s;es I went through, by Beatings and Stonings along the Streets, being di&s;tingui&s;hed to the People (by the Badge of Plainne&s;s which my Parents put upon me) of what Profe&s;&s;ion I was; divers telling me,
<Q>'Twas no more Sin to kill me, than it was to kill a Dog.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rotherhith</HI> Pari&s;h, in <HI>Southwark.</HI></NOTE>About this Time the Lord began to work &s;trongly on my Mind by his Grace, in&s;omuch that I could not forbear from reproving tho&s;e Lads who would take the Name of the Lord God in their Mouths in vain, re|minding them of the third Commandment, <HI>Thou &s;halt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s that taketh his Name in vain</HI>; and of Chri&s;t's Saying, <HI>Every idle Word that Men &s;hall &s;peak, they &s;hall give Account thereof in the Day of Judgment</HI>; for which I was mocked and de|rided by &s;ome, and others would &s;ometimes refrain from &s;uch bad Words when I reproved them.</P>
<P>One Time I remember I was among&s;t &s;ome Men, one of whom I had reproved, and he told the re&s;t of it, and turned to me, and &s;aid,
<Q>That I was no Chri|&s;tian,</Q>
and a&s;ked me when I &s;aid the Lord's Prayer. I a&s;ked him if he &s;aid it? He &s;aid. Yes. I then a&s;ked him how he could call God Father, and be &s;o wicked as to &s;wear and take God's Name in vain? which I had heard him often do; and I told him what Chri&s;t &s;aid to the <HI>Jews,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1685.</NOTE> <HI>You are of your Father the Devil, be|cau&s;e his Works ye do</HI>; and that tho&s;e that did the Devil's Work could not truly call God Father, ac|cording to Chri&s;t's Doctrine. So being convicted in their Con&s;ciences that what I &s;aid was true, they were all &s;ilent, and wondered that I, being &s;o young, &s;hould &s;peak in &s;uch a Manner; in which I remember I had great Peace and good Satisfaction: And from thence|forth the&s;e Men let me alone.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006297_0016_10285626EDCC22E8">Notwith&s;tanding I hated to hear wicked Words, I loved Play exceedingly, being per&s;uaded that there was no Harm in that, if we u&s;ed no bad Words. One Time I was at Play at a Neighbour's Hou&s;e with the Children, and in the mid&s;t of my Sport I was reach'd to with &s;trong Convictions, in&s;omuch that I could not forbear Weeping. The Childrens Mother ob&s;erving that I wept, &s;aid,
<Q>Why do you weep, <HI>Tommy?</HI></Q>
I told her I could not tell, except it was becau&s;e I was a naughty Boy.
<Q>Oh! &s;aid &s;he, don't believe him, for that's the Devil tells you &s;o, for you are the be&s;t Boy in all our Street.</Q>
But I knew I was told the Truth by Conviction, and that &s;he was mi&s;taken: For I plainly under&s;tood by clear Conviction, and by the Holy Scriptures (which I had been train'd up in the Reading of) that I was too vain and wanton; for I loved Mu&s;ic, Dancing, and Play|ing at Cards, and too much delighted therein betimes, and was followed with the Judgments of God there|fore i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Secret of my Soul.</P>
<P>What I did in tho&s;e Sports and Games, I always took care to do out of the Sight, and without the Know|ledge of my tender Parents; for I was afraid of their Reproofs and Correction, the which I was &s;ure to have, if they had any Intelligence of it.</P>
<P>I remember that, unknown to my Parents, I had bought a Pack of Cards, with Intent to make u&s;e of them when I went to &s;ee my Relations in the Country, where there was Liberty in the Family &s;o to do, at a Place called <HI>Woodford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Woodford, <HI>in</HI> E&s;&s;ex.</NOTE> about &s;even Miles from <HI>Lon|don,</HI> where I got Leave &s;ometimes to go; and at the Time called <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> I went to &s;ee them, and five Miles on my Way went to a Meeting, at a Town call'd <HI>Wan&s;tead</HI>; at which Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wan&s;tead.</NOTE> a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t declared again&s;t the Evil of Gaming, and par|ticularly of Cards; and that the Time which People pretend to keep Holy, for Chri&s;t's Sake, many of them &s;pend mo&s;tly in Wickedne&s;s, Sports, and Games; even
<PB N="4" REF="006297_0017_1028562A2E153DC0">
&s;ome pretending to be Religious: And, generally &s;peaking, more Sin and Evil is committed in this Time, than in the like Space of Time in all the Year be&s;ides; &s;o that the Devil is &s;erved in&s;tead of honouring Chri&s;t. From this Meeting at <HI>Wan&s;tead,</HI> I went to the Hou&s;e of my Relations, where the Par&s;on of the next Pari&s;h lodged that Night, who u&s;ed to play at Cards with them &s;ometimes; and the Time drawing near that we were to go to our Games, my Uncle called to the Doctor (as he call'd him) to me, and to my Cou&s;in, to come and take a Game at Cards; at which Mo|tion I had &s;trong Convictions upon me not to do it, as being Evil, and I &s;ecretly cry'd to the Lord to keep me faithful to him; and lifting up my Eyes, I &s;aw a Bible lie in the Window, at the Sight of which I was glad. I took it, and &s;at down, and read to my &s;elf, greatly rejoicing that I was pre&s;erved out of the Share. Then my Uncle called again, and &s;aid,
<Q>Come, Doc|tor, you and I, and my Wife and Daughter, will have a Game at Cards, for I &s;ee my Cou&s;ins, bet|ter di&s;po&s;ed.</Q>
Then he looked upon me, and &s;aid, "He was better di&s;po&s;ed al&s;o." So their Sport for that Time was &s;poiled, and mine in that Practice for ever; for I never (as I remember) play'd with them more, but as &s;oon as I came Home, offered my new and untouch'd Pack of Cards to the Fire. And of this I am certain, the U&s;e of them is of evil Con&s;equence, and draws away the Mind from Heaven and heavenly Things; for which Rea&s;on all Chri&s;tians ought to &s;hun them as Engines of Satan: And Mu&s;ic, and Dancing, having generally the &s;ame Tendency, ought therefore to be refrain'd from. The Sentiments of the <HI>Wal|den&s;es,</HI> a People in great E&s;teem among Prote&s;tants, are worthy the Con&s;ideration of all true Prote&s;tants and Chri&s;tians; which were
<Q>That as many Paces, or Steps, as the Man or Woman takes in the Dance, &s;o many Paces or Steps they take towards Hell.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006297_0018_1028562DA06BE958">I very well remember the Work of God upon my Soul, when I was about ten Years of Age; and par|ticularly at a certain Time when I had been rebelling again&s;t God and my Parents, in Vanity and Lightne&s;s: And as I had offended both, &s;o I was corrected by both. For I had not only the Anger of my Parents, but the Lord frown'd upon me, in&s;omuch that I trem|bled exceedingly, and was as tho' I heard a vocal Voice &s;ay to me,
<Q>What will become of thee this Night, if I &s;hould take thy Life from thee?</Q>
At which I was amazed, and in great Fear. Then I covenanted with God, that if he would be plea&s;ed to &s;pare my Life (for I thought God would have taken my Life from me that very Moment) I would be more &s;ober, and mind his Fear more than I had done before.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s I broke Covenant with God my Ma|ker, my Adver&s;ary tempting me &s;o to do, telling me I was but a Child, and that it was natural for Children to be bri&s;k and to play, and that God would wink at my Childhood and Youth, and it was time enough for me, when a Man, to become Religious. But &s;till God followed me with his cha&s;ti&s;ing Rod, and often put me in Mind of my Covenant that I made with him in my Di&s;tre&s;s; and that he had granted my Reque&s;t which I then made to him; and unle&s;s I would take up a Cro&s;s to my own corrupt Will and Inclinations, he &s;hould take me out of the World. Then, Oh then! I cried, <HI>Lord help, or I die! Save me, or I peri&s;h for ever!</HI> I cannot keep thy Covenant, nor do thy Will, without thy Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance! And indeed if the Lord had not helped, I had been undone for ever.</P>
<P>So I continued bow'd down in my Mind, calling on the Lord; thinking and meditating on Heaven and heavenly Things: But, as I am &s;en&s;ible, I had an in|ward Enemy that always &s;ought my Hurt and Over|throw, I have Cau&s;e to ble&s;s God, who by his Grace (as mine Eye was turned to it) helped me to do his

Will, as he was plea&s;ed to manife&s;t it to me; &s;o that thereby &s;ome Change was wrought on me, both in|wardly and outwardly.</P>
<P>And I then began to delight in Reading and Sobriety, which before were irk&s;ome to me: And when I read the Holy Scriptures, I de&s;ired that God would open them to my Under&s;tanding, which he did to my Edi|fication many Times. I al&s;o begged earne&s;tly of the Lord, that he would be pleas'd to be with me, and make me like to tho&s;e his Children and Servants, of whom I read in the Holy Scriptures, who faithfully &s;erved Him all their Days. And when I read of the Crucifixion of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, it would break my Soul into Tenderne&s;s. I thought it was enough to awaken and humble any Soul that was well-meaning, and had any Sen&s;e of the Power, Love, and Grace, of Chri&s;t. Thus I went on for &s;everal Years, feeling that Peace which pa&s;&s;eth natural Under&s;tanding, which many Times accompa|nied my poor and needy Soul. And being advanced to about 14 or 15 Years of Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1690.</HI> Shad-Thames, Southwark.</NOTE> I remember that I u&s;ed to &s;hun the Cro&s;s of &s;peaking in the plain Lan|guage (which I always read in the Holy Scriptures) to tho&s;e whom I conver&s;ed with, except my Father and Mother, who would not allow me to &s;peak other|wi&s;e: I was convicted in my Con&s;cience that it was not right to play the Hypocrite after that Manner; and on a certain Time I had Occa&s;ion to &s;peak with an Officer, a great Man in our Neighbourhood, and my Heart moved within me for fear I &s;hould &s;hun the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t: For it was Chri&s;t's Language to all, as we may read in the New Te&s;tament; and the Scriptures, from <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the <HI>Revelations,</HI> &s;peak Thee and Thou, to a &s;ingle Per&s;on, in a general Way.</P>
<P>So I took up the Cro&s;s, and &s;aid Thee to him; and he was much affronted, and &s;aid,
<Q>Thee! what do&s;t thou Thee me for?</Q>
I &s;oberly a&s;ked him if he did not &s;ay Thee to his Maker in his Prayers? and whe|ther

he was too good, or too great, to be &s;poke to in the &s;ame Language in which he addre&s;s'd the Al|mighty? Unto which he made no Reply, but &s;eem'd to fall from his Pa&s;&s;ion into Admiration, as one &s;mit|ten in him&s;elf. And he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re me Re&s;pect ever after; and I greatly rejoiced that I was pre&s;erved faithful. Tho' it may look like a little Thing to &s;ome, yet I found it good as the Scripture &s;aith <HI>not to de&s;pi&s;e the Day of &s;mall Things.</HI></P>
<P>About the twentieth Year of my Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1694.</NOTE> I was pre&s;|&s;ed and carried aboard a Ve&s;&s;el belonging to a Man of War. I was put down into the Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in the Dark, not having any Thing to lie upon but Ca&s;ks; and what made it wor&s;e to me, I was among wicked, de|bauched Men; and as we were &s;hut up in Darkne&s;s, &s;o was their Conver&s;ation dark and helli&s;h. In the Morning (for which I longed more than the Watch|men) the Lieutenant called us up on Deck, and exa|mined us whether we were willing to &s;erve the King. He called me to him, and a&s;ked me,
<Q>If I were willing to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty?</Q>
I an&s;wered, that I was willing to &s;erve him in my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and accord|ing to my Con&s;cience, but as for War or Fighting, CHRIST had forbid it, in his excellent Sermon on the Mount; and for that Rea&s;on I could not bear Arms, nor be in&s;trumental to de&s;troy or kill Men. Then the Lieutenant looked on me, and on the People, and &s;aid, "Gentlemen, what &s;hall we do with this Fellow? he &s;wears he will not Fight." The Commander of the Ve&s;&s;el made An&s;wer, "No, no! "he will neither Swear nor Fight." Upon which they turn'd me on Shore. I was thankful that I was delivered out of their Hands; and my tender Parents were glad to &s;ee me again.</P>
<P>Now as I grew in Years, the World began to take too much Root in me; and my unwearied Enemy would tell me that it was lawful enough and indeed I &s;ee that he hurts many with lawful Things, with
<PB N="8" REF="006297_0021_1028563826FBF330">
whom he knoweth that unlawful Things will not take, and here I had been lo&s;t, if God had not been gra|cious to me. But he in who&s;e Pre&s;ence I delighted, withdrew, and deprived me of that Enjoyment which was graceful and comfortable above all Things to my Soul. Then did I pray, with Tears, O that it might be with me as it was at other Times before! and I was willing to let the World go, rather than Grace and God's Glory. The P&s;almi&s;t &s;aith, <HI>No good Thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly,</HI> P&s;al. lxxxiv. Ver&s;e 11.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1695.</NOTE>About this Time there was a great Concern on my Mind, rightly to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Voice of Chri&s;t, and the Whi&s;perings of Satan, and thus it open'd to me: That Chri&s;t, the Truth, always &s;peak|eth Good, and for a good End, and that there is divine Life to the Soul in this Speaking; but the Devil never &s;peaks Good, unle&s;s &s;ometimes for a bad End, and then not Good in Reality, only colour'd with a good, or fair Shew.</P>
<P>And keeping under this Exerci&s;e, the Lord appear'd to me again, and many Times refre&s;h'd my Heart with his Goodne&s;s. And when I was in my Bu&s;ine&s;s a|mong&s;t Men, I did Witne&s;s the Holy Gho&s;t, the Comforter, to be near me; which was more to me than all the World, or the Riches, Glory, and Beau|ty of it; the Love of God being &s;o &s;weet to my Soul and Spirit, my Breathings, Prayers, and Supplications, were to the Lord, that my Neighbours, Acquaintance, and Relations, might al&s;o partake of the like precious Faitn and Love which I enjoy'd; and that the Chil|dren of Men might an&s;wer that great and good End for which the Lord did create them; which is, that Glory, Honour, and Prai&s;e, might a&s;cend and be gi|ven to him.</P>
<P>I had &s;uch a Sen&s;e and Fear of Di&s;honouring God, that I often, with Tears, cry'd, Never let me live to di&s;honour Thee. Oh! it had been better for me, than
<PB N="9" REF="006297_0022_10285639AD870B68">
I had never been born, or my Mother's Womb had been my Grave, than that I &s;hould live to di&s;honour Thee, or wilfully reproach the Name of Chri&s;t, who, with the Father, is only worthy of Divine Honour.</P>
<P>In this Concern I felt the Go&s;pel Power of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to work upon my Soul, and the Word of God was as a Seed in my Heart, growing and opening in me, &s;peaking to me, and making my Under&s;tanding fruitful in the Things of his Kingdom; and in that Abi|lity which was given me of God, through his Grace and Holy Spirit, I exhorted People to Repentance and Amendment of Life; and I always humbly de&s;ir'd the Help and Divine Influence of God's eternal Word therein. Oh! I did fervently pray, that I might mini|&s;ter the Go&s;pel in the Power of Je&s;us; for I clearly di&s;cern'd in the Light of the Son of God, that all Mini&s;tring out of Chri&s;t's Power, was neither edifying nor efficacious unto Souls: Therefore I did earne&s;tly be&s;eech God for the Continuance of the Gift of His Spirit, that I might be enabled to preach the Go&s;pel in the Power of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. The Concern that was upon me on this Account at that Time, is hard to be expre&s;s'd in Words.</P>
<P>The latter End of the Year 1695, my Father &s;ent me into <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> on &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s, which, when I had accompli&s;hed, I vi&s;ited &s;ome Meetings of Friends there, and my Mind being much affected with the Apprehen|&s;ions of an impending Storm, (the Nation being about this Time threatened with an Inva&s;ion from <HI>France,</HI> in favour of the late King <HI>James,</HI> &s;o that there was Ex|pectation of much Blood&s;hed and Confu&s;ion in the Land) I wrote a Letter to my Parents, and another to Friends of the Evening Meeting (kept Weekly at my Father's Hou&s;e) expre&s;&s;ing my great Thankfulne&s;s to the Almighty, in Remembrance of the many pre|cious Vi&s;itations of Divine Love and Favour we had been made Partakers of, to the uniting our Hearts to Him, and to one another; and my earne&s;t Prayers

<P>We were three Ships in Company, but by Di&s;tre&s;s of Weather, &s;oon after we came out, we parted.

<P>Oh for ever ble&s;&s;ed be the Living and Eternal God, who kept my Soul above the Fear of Death, Hell, and the Grave; for my Tru&s;t was in Him, and He did bear up my Spirit above the Waves of the Sea; and in the Time of To&s;&s;ing with Tempe&s;ts, I was comforted and chearful, Prai&s;ing the Lord in my Heart, both in the Day Time, and in the Night Sea&s;on.</P>

<Q>This great and &s;pacious Place, wherein the Buildings were high, and the Streets broad, is thy great and high Profe&s;&s;ion: The Sign, on which was wrote <HI>Shame,</HI> which thou &s;awe&s;t, and the Woman at the Door, with the Can in her Hand, truly repre|&s;ents that great, crying and &s;hameful Sin of Drunken|ne&s;s, which thou knows to be thy great Weakne&s;s, which the Woman with the Can did truly repre&s;ent to thee: The grim Fellow which arre&s;ted thee in the De|vil's Territories is Death, who will a&s;&s;uredly arre&s;t all Mortals: The Governor which thou &s;awe&s;t, repre|&s;enting a great black Dog, is certainly the Devil, who after his Servants have &s;erved him to the full, will tor|ment them eternally in Hell.</Q>
So he g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t up, as it were in ha&s;t, and &s;aid,
<Q>God forbid! It is nothing but a Dream.</Q>
But I told him it was a very &s;ignificant

One, and a Warning to him from the Almighty, who &s;ometimes &s;peaks to Men by Dreams.</P>
<P>In &s;even Weeks after we left Sight of the Land of <HI>America,</HI> we &s;aw the <HI>Scilly</HI> I&s;lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Channel.</NOTE> and next Day we &s;aw the Land of <HI>England,</HI> which was a comfortable Sight to us; in that God Almighty had pre&s;erved us hitherto, and that we were &s;o far got on our Way. We drove about the Channel's Mouth for &s;everal Days for Want of Wind; after which, for two Days the Wind came up, and we got as far up the Channel as <HI>Limebay,</HI> and then an Ea&s;terly Wind blew fre&s;h for &s;everal Days, and we turned to Windward, but rather lo&s;t than got on our Way, which was tire&s;ome and te|dious to &s;ome of us.</P>
<P>Now about this Time (being &s;ome Days after the Doctor's Dream) a grievous Accident happened to us. We meeting with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el in <HI>Limebay</HI> a little a|bove the <HI>Start,</HI> hailed her, and &s;he us. They &s;aid they came from <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> and were bound for <HI>Holland.</HI> She was loaded with Wine, Brandy, Fruit, and &s;uch like Commodities; and we having little but Water to drink (by rea&s;on our Pa&s;&s;age was longer than we ex|pected) therefore we &s;ent our Boat on Board, in order to buy us a little Wine to drink with our Water. Our Doctor, and a Merchant that was a Pa&s;&s;enger, and one Sailor, went on Board, where they &s;taid &s;o long until &s;ome of them were overcome with Wine, altho' they were de&s;ired to beware thereof; &s;o that when they came back, a Rope being handed to them, they (being fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led with Wine unto Exce&s;s) were not capable of u&s;ing it dextrou&s;ly, in&s;omuch that they over&s;et the Boat, and &s;he turned Bottom upwards, having the Doctor under her. The Merchant caught hold of a Rope called the Main Sheet, whereby his Life was &s;aved. The Sailor not getting &s;o much drink, as the other two, got nim|bly on the Bottom of the Boat, and floated on the Water till &s;uch Time as our other Boat was hoi&s;ted out, which was done with great Speed, and we took

him in; but the Doctor was drowned before the Boat came. The Seaman that &s;at upon the Boat &s;aw him &s;ink, but could not help him. This was the greate&s;t Exerci&s;e that we met with in all our Voyage; and much the more &s;o, as the Doctor was of an evil Life and Conver&s;ation, and much given to Exce&s;s in Drinking. When he got on Board the afore&s;aid Ship, the Ma&s;ter &s;ent for a Can of Wine, and &s;aid,
<Q>Doctor, will you drink.</Q>
He replied,
<Q>Yes, with all my Heart, for I've drank no Wine a great while.</Q>
Upon which he drank a hearty Draught, that made him mer|ry (as he &s;aid in his Dream; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N.

This is, I think, a lively Repre|&s;entation of the tender Mercy, and ju&s;t Judgment of the Almighty to poor Mortals; and I thought it was worthy to be recorded to Po&s;terity, as a Warning to all great Lovers of Wine and &s;trong Liquors. This Exerci&s;e was &s;o great to me, that I could not for &s;everal Days get over it; and one Day while I was mu&s;ing in my Mind on tho&s;e Things relating to the Doctor, it was opened to me, that God and his Ser|vants were clear, and his Blood was on his own Head; for he had been faithfully warned of his evil Ways.</P>

reported on the I&s;land that the Governor had given us a Licen&s;e to preach (which Report was not true, further than the afore&s;aid Di&s;cour&s;e) and then we had larger Meetings than before. We had a Meeting at Judge <HI>Stafford</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and one at a Hou&s;e not far from his.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that this I&s;land hath formerly been a very healthy and fruitful Place.

In one of the Meetings I was concerned to let them know, that it was the Evil of their Ways and Doings that had cau&s;ed the Almighty to with-hold from them the Fruits of the Earth, and to make their I&s;land more unhealthful than formerly it was.

<Q>That if I could not go to the Garri&s;on, I might go to a Friend's Hou&s;e that was near it.</Q>
<HI>And I was willing to plea&s;e him, if the Lord was willing; and then applied my Heart to know the Mind of Truth, and it was &s;hewed me, that if I moved again, I &s;hould loo&s;e the Sen&s;e of Truth, and I &s;hould never hold up my

been any Meetings before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1706.</NOTE> At one of the&s;e Meetings were one <HI>Edwards</HI> a Prie&s;t, and a Lawyer the Attor|ney-General, and &s;everal of the Ju&s;tices of the Peace. The Prie&s;t was angry, and &s;aid,
<Q>It was an unlawful A&s;&s;embly, the Hou&s;e not being licen&s;ed by Law.</Q>
The Ju&s;tices told him,
<Q>That he and his People being there to hear, if any unwarrantable or fal&s;e Doctrines was preached, he had a fair Opportunity to lay it open before all the People.</Q>
So they de&s;ired him to hear patiently and quietly. He &s;eem'd to like the Propo&s;ition, and &s;at down by me. We had not &s;at down long before I &s;tood up, and &s;poke to the People &s;ome con&s;iderable Time; and the Lawyer &s;at oppo&s;ite to me, and took what I &s;aid in Short-Hand, for about Half an Hour; but growing weary, he laid down his Pen, and took out of his Pocket a Bottle of Liquor, or Spirits, and &s;aid,
<Q>Come, Friend, here is to thee (or you) you have &s;poke a great While, you need &s;omething to refre&s;h you.</Q>
So I made a Stop, and &s;aid to the People, Here is your Mini&s;ter, and here is &s;ome of the Fruits of his Mini&s;try, of which he and all &s;ober People may be a&s;hamed. And then I went on again without any Oppo&s;ition till I had done; but afterwards they were in a Rage, and threatened what they would do to me, if ever I came to have a Meet|ing any more there. But I told 'em if they had Pow|er to take our Lives from us, they were not dear to us for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t and his Go&s;pel; and that we did not matter their Threatenings, I de&s;ired the Law|yer to give me a Copy of what he had written: He went about it, but did not do it; neither was he can|did in penning my Words; for &s;everal of the People then pre&s;ent did bear Witne&s;s he had not wrote it <HI>Ver|batim,</HI> nor truly taken the Sen&s;e of what I &s;poke, wherefore I charged him to be Ju&s;t, otherwi&s;e he had many Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him; at which the Prie&s;t bent his Fi&s;t, and held it up to me, but did not &s;trike me, and away they went in a Fret.

<Q>That our Meetings among them might be very beneficial to their young People,</Q>

After having had divers Meetings, the Packet in which we had taken our Pa&s;&s;age, being o|blig'd to &s;tay but ten Days, we went off &s;ooner than we otherwi&s;e &s;hou'd have done, and &s;olemnly taking Leave of tho&s;e Friends that were there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sails for <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> we went on Board our Ve&s;&s;el, in order for <HI>England,</HI> by God's Permi&s;&s;ion.

in order to make more Speed, and came running mightily towards us, and gained much upon us; we fearing to make Sail by Rea&s;on of the Storm, and the Sea running very high, and our Ma&s;ts being therefore in Danger, we were &s;ome Time in Doubt whether we &s;hould e&s;cape or not: But whil&s;t we were in this Con|&s;ternation, down came the French Ship's three Top|ma&s;ts at once, &s;o we e&s;caped, and left her, and went rejoicing on our Way, that we were thus delivered.

Then our Ma&s;ter ordered the Anchor to be let go,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Got &s;afe on the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ri&s;h</HI> Shore.</NOTE> which brought her up before &s;he &s;truck; and, with much ado, he put his Boat out into the Sea, and put in all the Pa&s;&s;engers, in order to &s;et them on Shore, the Waves r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning very high, &s;o that it looked as if every Wave would have &s;wallowed us up; and it was a great Fa|vour of Providence that we got to Land in Safety.

<P>When I came from my Home at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I did intend (the Lord permitting) to vi&s;it Friends in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and being accidentally ca&s;t on Shore there, I thought it my Place fir&s;t to go thro' that Nation.

In this Nation we had many and large Meetings after our Landing, vi&s;iting Friends Meetings along to the North, many, not of our Society, coming to them, among whom we often had good Service, to our and their Sa|tisfaction, as they often declared, <HI>Richard Gove</HI> be|ing &s;till with me.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotland.</NOTE>We took Ship in the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> at a Town called <HI>Donaghadet,</HI> being accompanied with divers Bre|thren, who brought us on our Way after a godly Sort.

This a little aba&s;hed them for the pre&s;ent, but afterwards they were as bad as ever. There were at this Meeting divers Collegians, who were very rude. I a&s;ked if that was their Way of treating Strangers? And that I believed their Teachers in the Univer&s;ity did not allow of &s;uch ill Manners, by which they &s;candalized them&s;elves, their City, and Country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hamilton <HI>and</HI> Ger&s;hore.</NOTE> From this City we went to <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Ger&s;hore,</HI> where they were more civil. At <HI>Ger&s;hore</HI> a Man of Letters, and &s;ober Conver&s;ation, begged that I would pray to the Almighty, that he would e&s;ta|bli&s;h him in the Doctrine which he had heard that Day. This being rare in tho&s;e Parts, therefore I thus minute it here. We went on towards the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and thereabouts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1708.</NOTE> where there is a tender-hearted People, among whom we had &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge Gatherings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aberdeen.</NOTE> and &s;ome that were not of us, expre&s;s'd their Satisfaction. In the North I met with a Gentle|man, who coming from a Nobleman's Hou&s;e, joined me, and a&s;ked me, "If I knew <HI>Robert Barclay?</HI>" I &s;aid not per&s;onally, but by his Writings I knew him well. He told me,
<Q>That he <HI>(Barclay)</HI> had not left his Fellow in <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q>
We afterwards travelled Southward, where there were but few Friends, and &s;mall Meetings; yet we may &s;ay, that the Goodne&s;s, Love, and Pre&s;ence, of Him, who &s;aid, <HI>Where two or three are gathered in my Name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them,</HI> was oftentimes witne&s;&s;ed to be with us, ble&s;&s;ed be his Holy Name.

So in great Reverence and holy Fear, we travelled along towards <HI>South-Britain,</HI> had &s;everal Meetings at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and divers other Places;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edin|burgh.

<P>I &s;tay'd in and about the City mo&s;t of the Winter, vi&s;iting Meetings when I was well and in Health; for thro' often changing the Climates, I got a &s;evere Cold, and was ill for &s;everal Weeks, &s;o that I was not at any Meeting, which Time was very tedious to me; not &s;o much becau&s;e of my Illne&s;s, as that I was depri|ved of divers Opportunities and Meetings (which are in that City every Day of the Week except the la&s;t.)

<P>We travelled in this Journey thro' &s;ome Parts of the Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI>'s Dominions, as al&s;o of the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Swedeland,</HI> and of the Duke of <HI>Oldenburgh</HI>'s and Prince of <HI>Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land</HI>'s Ter|ritories, be&s;ides &s;ome Parts of the <HI>Seven Provinces</HI> of the united States. We parted with our Friends of this City of <HI>Frederick&s;tadt,</HI> in much Love and Tenderne&s;s, and with our Hearts full of good Will, one towards another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Embden.</NOTE> and &s;o went back to the City of <HI>Embden</HI> a nearer Way, by two Days Journey, than to go by <HI>Hamburgh.</HI> We cro&s;s'd the Rivers <HI>Eyder, Elfe,</HI> and <HI>Wei&s;er</HI>; over which la&s;t we were rowed by three Wo|men. <HI>The Women in tho&s;e Parts of the World are &s;trong and robu&s;t, and u&s;ed to hard Labour.

it being common with them to do the mo&s;t laborious, and the Men the lighte&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Work. I remember that I once &s;aw near</HI> Hamburgh <HI>a fair well-dre&s;&s;ed Woman, who, by her Dre&s;s, or Appearance, was a Woman of &s;ome Note, and a Man (which I took to be her Hu&s;band) walking by her, and &s;he was very great with Child, and the Way difficult, being up a very &s;teep Hill, and he did not &s;o much as offer his Hand, or A&s;&s;i&s;tance to her; which, however it might look to a Man of that Coun|try, it &s;eem'd very &s;trange to me, being a</HI> Briton. <HI>For my Part, I thought it unmanly, as well as unmannerly: O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which I ob&s;erve, that I never in any Part of the World, &s;aw Women &s;o tenderly dealt by as our</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>or</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Women, which they ought to value and prize highly, and therefore, to be the more loving and obedi|ent to their Hu&s;bands, the indulgent</HI> Engli&s;hmen; <HI>which Indulgence I blame not, but commend, &s;o far as it is a Motive to &s;tir them up to Love and Faithfulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>In this Journey between <HI>Frederick&s;tadt</HI> and <HI>Embden,</HI> we had four Days hard travelling, and were twice overturned out of our Waggons, but we got no Harm, which was admirable to us; for once we fell Waggon and all over a great Bank, ju&s;t by the Side of a large Ditch, and did but ju&s;t &s;ave our&s;elves out of the Ditch. The next Time we over&s;et upon Stones: We wonder|ed that none of us were hurt, particularly my&s;elf, I being much heavier than any of the re&s;t; but thro' the Mercy of God, we got well to <HI>Embden</HI> the &s;econd Time, and had a Meeting upon a Fir&s;t Day, and im|mediately after Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delfzeel.</NOTE> we took Ship for <HI>Delfzeel</HI> (which was from <HI>Embden</HI> about nine or ten <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles, by Water) and with a fair Gale of Wind, got there in le&s;s than two Hours Time. We &s;poke by In|terpreters all along, and were divinely helped to preach the Go&s;pel to the Satisfaction of others, and our own Comfort; and the Friend who interpreted for us, was &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ame Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to his Admira|tion,

<P>About this Time (after a long Continuance of War) there was great talking of Peace; but the old Enemy to Peace, Truth, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, broke it off by his evil Working in Man: Neither can there be any la&s;ting Peace, until the Nations come to the Witne&s;&s;ing of the peaceable Government and Spirit of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;hed in them&s;elves.

<HEAD>A JOURNAL OF THE LIFE, LABOURS, TRAVELS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> OF THOMAS CHALKLEY. PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW gave up my Time mo&s;tly to travelling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1712.</NOTE> for about the Space of two Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1713.</NOTE> in which I vi&s;ited the Meetings of Friends in the Provinces of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania, Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Penn&s;yl|vania, Jer&s;ey, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, Philadel|phia, Long I&s;land, Rhode-I&s;land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mary|land, Virginia,</HI> and <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> and back again to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and then to <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> again: Al&s;o to <HI>Long-I&s;land, Rhode-I&s;land, Conanicut-I&s;land, Nan|tucket-I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> and thro' tho&s;e Parts on my Return to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> In the&s;e Provinces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I travelled &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Miles, and had many large Meetings (&s;ome in Places where there had not been any before) and &s;ome were convinced, and many would acknowledge to the Te&s;timony of Truth,
<PB N="78" REF="006297_0091_1028570E7AAAC0C8">
which was declared by the Help and Grace of Chri&s;t; and many Times, my Heart was, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Grace, wonderfully opened to the People. If I &s;hould be particular in the Account of the&s;e Journies, it would enlarge this Part of my Journal more than I am willing.</P>
<P>In <HI>Virginia</HI> I had a Meeting at <HI>James'</HI> River, where a Prie&s;t of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> with &s;ome of his Hearers, made &s;ome Oppo&s;ition (after our Meeting was over) and were for di&s;puting about Re|ligion; and he openly declared,
<Q>The Spirit was not his Guide, nor Rule; and he hoped, never &s;hould be. But, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> the Scriptures were his Rule, and that there was no Need of any other; and that they were as plain as <HI>Gunter</HI>'s Line, or as 1, 2, 3.</Q>
I told him, <HI>The Scriptures were a good &s;econdary Rule, and that it were well if Men would &s;quare their Lives according to their Directions; which we, as a People&punc; exhorted all to: But that the Holy Spirit, from which the Holy Scriptures came, mu&s;t needs be preferable to the Letter, that came from it; and without which Holy Spirit,</HI> The Letter kills, <HI>as &s;aith the Apo&s;tle.</HI> I al&s;o a&s;ked him, <HI>How he, or any el&s;e, without the Light, or Influence of the Holy Spirit, could under&s;tand the Scrip|tures, which were parabolically and allegorically expre&s;|&s;ed, in many Places?</HI> And further to u&s;e his own Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, <HI>How could any under&s;tand</HI> Gunter's <HI>Line, without</HI> Gunter<HI>'s Knowledge? Or without they were taught by</HI> Gunter, <HI>or &s;ome other?</HI> Neither can we be the Sons of God, without the Spirit of God. Which he an&s;wered not, but went away.</P>
<P>In <HI>New-England,</HI> one <HI>Jo&s;eph Metcalf,</HI> a Pre&s;byte|rian Teacher, at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> wrote a Book, entitled, <HI>Legal Forcing a Maintenance for a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, warrantable from Scripture,</HI> &amp;c. Which Book, a Friend of <HI>Sandwich</HI> gave me, and de&s;ired I would an&s;wer it; which, after finding &s;ome Exerci&s;e on my Mind, for the Cau&s;e of Truth, I was willing
<PB N="79" REF="006297_0092_102857107A0604E8">
to undertake; and accordingly, wrote an An&s;wer there|to which I called, <HI>Forcing a Maintenance, not war|rantable from the Holy Scriptures, for a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel.</HI> In which I endeavoured to &s;et the Texts of Scripture in a true Light, which he had darkened and mi&s;repre&s;ented by his chimerical Doctrines.</P>
<P>In this Year, 1713, I went from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in the <HI>Hope Galley, John Richmond,</HI> Ma&s;ter, to <HI>South-Carolina.</HI> We were about a Month at Sea; and when it plea&s;ed God that we arrived at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">South-Ca|rolina.</NOTE> in <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> we had a Meeting there, and divers others afterwards. There are but few Friends in this Pro|vince; yet I had &s;everal Meetings in the Country. The People were generally loving, and received me kindly. What I had to declare to them, I always de|&s;ired to &s;peak to the Witne&s;s of God in the Soul, and according to the pure Doctrine of Truth in the Holy Scriptures; and there was Opene&s;s in the People in &s;everal Places. I was &s;everal Times to vi&s;it the Go|vernor, who was courteous and civil to me. He &s;aid, "I de&s;erved Encouragement;" and &s;poke to &s;everal to be generous, and contribute to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance. He meant an outward Maintenance; for he would have me encouraged to &s;tay among them. But I told him, that tho' it might be a Practice with them, to maintain their Mini&s;ters, and pay them Money for preaching, it was contrary to our Principle to be paid for preaching; agreeable to the Command of our great Ma&s;ter, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who &s;aid to his Mini&s;ters, <HI>Freely you have re|ceived, freely give:</HI> So that we are limited by his Words, whatever others are: And tho&s;e who take a Liberty, contrary to his Doctrine and Command, I think, mu&s;t be <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI>'s, according to Holy Scrip|ture. The longer I &s;taid there, the larger our Meet|ings were; and when I found my &s;elf free and clear of tho&s;e Parts, I took my Pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Virginia,</HI> in a Sloop, <HI>Henry Tucker,</HI> Ma&s;ter. I had a comfortable and quick Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>James</HI>' River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virginia.</NOTE> it being about
<PB N="80" REF="006297_0093_10285713B9C258B0">
two Hundred Leagues. The Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el told me,
<Q>That he believed he was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for my Sake.</Q>
I wi&s;hed him to live &s;o as that he might be ble&s;&s;ed for Chri&s;t's Sake. And &s;ome R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; was begun on him in our Voyage; when was the Good|ne&s;s of God, tho' Chri&s;t, to him, and not to be at|tributed to me, any f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the Divine Hand&punc; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of our&s;elves we cannot do any Thing that is Good, it being by Grace, tho' Faith, that we are &s;aved, which is God's Gift to the Soul.</P>
<P>After I had been &s;ome Time in <HI>Virginia,</HI> I got a Pa&s;&s;age up the Bay of <HI>Che&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k,</HI> and had &s;everal Meetings in <HI>Maryland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Maryland.</NOTE> Friends being glad to &s;ee me; and we were comforted in Chri&s;t our Lord. I made &s;ome little Stay at a Place I had in that Province, cal|led <HI>Longbridge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.</NOTE> and then returned to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where I lodged at the Hou&s;e of my very kind Friends <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>Hannah Hall</HI>; and was oftentimes at di|vers neighbouring Meetings; and &s;ometimes had good Service therein.</P>
<P>About this Time I had an Inclination to alter my Condition of being a Widower, to a married State; and the mo&s;t &s;uitable Per&s;on that I (with &s;ome of my good Friends could think upon, was <HI>Martha,</HI> the Wi|dow of <HI>Jo&s;eph Brown:</HI> And on the 15th of the Second Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1714.</NOTE> 1714, we were joined together in Marriage, with the Unity of Friends in general. We had a large Meeting at our Marriage, the Solemnization thereof being attended with the Grace and Goodne&s;s of God; and, for Example-&s;ake, we made but little Provi&s;ion for our Gue&s;ts: For great Entertainments at Mar|riages and Funerals, began to be a growing Thing among us, which was attended with divers Inconve|niencies.</P>
<P>My Wife was a &s;ober and religious young Woman, and of a quiet natura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition; which is an excellent Ornament to the fair Sex: And indeed it is &s;o both to Male and Female; for according to the
<PB N="81" REF="006297_0094_102857168CE4B478">
Holy Scriptures, <HI>A meek and quiet Spirit is with the Lord of great Price.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Child we had I called <HI>Abigail</HI> (or the Fa|ther's Joy, as the Word &s;ignifies) and while &s;he lived, I had Joy and Comfort in her, even more than I could expect, her Age con&s;idered; for &s;he lived but about eighteen Months, yet in that Time gave frequent Proofs of an uncommon Capacity, and dropt &s;uch extra|ordinary Expre&s;&s;ions, that I have &s;aid to her Mother,
<Q>This Child is too ripe for Heaven to live long on Earth, therefore let us not &s;et our Hearts upon it.</Q>
And I have thought that in this Child the Saying of Chri&s;t was fulfilled, even in the Letter of it, <HI>Out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings, thou ha&s;t perfected Prai&s;e,</HI> Mat. xxi. 16.</P>
<P>I was at divers Yearly Meetings in 1715,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1715.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Choptank</HI> in <HI>Maryland</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maryland. Shrew&s;bu|ry. Salem.</NOTE> at <HI>Shrew&s;bury</HI> and <HI>Salem</HI> in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI>; all which Meetings were very large and comfortable; many Things being opened therein tend|ing to the Convincing and E&s;tabli&s;hing the People in the Truth and Doctrine of Chri&s;t. I was likewi&s;e at divers other Meetings in tho&s;e Provinces; which were large and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>At <HI>Salem</HI> Yearly Meeting I was &s;ent for to the Pri|&s;on, where there was a young Woman that was to be try'd for her Life. She de&s;ir'd that I would pray for her, and charged me to warn the young People to be careful not to keep bad Company:
<Q>For, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> it has been my Ruin, and brought me to this Shame and Reproach.</Q>
She had been tenderly brought up and educated. I knew her when &s;he wore a Neck|lace of Gold Chains, tho' now &s;he wore Iron ones: Upon which Subject I had afterwards a large Opportunity to &s;peak to the People in a very moving Manner; which &s;eem'd to very much affect the Youth, and others in the Meeting, which con&s;i&s;ted of many Hundreds of People. I &s;aw this young Woman afterwards, the Jury acquit|ting her; and I told her, that her Life was given her for
<PB N="82" REF="006297_0095_102857181488A720">
a Prey; and reminded her, how it was with her when &s;he was in Pri&s;on in Chains; and I advi&s;ed her to walk more circum&s;pectly for the future; which &s;he &s;aid, &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould do.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1716.</NOTE>In the Year 1716, I had &s;ome Concerns which drew me to the I&s;land of <HI>Bermudas</HI> (to which I&s;land I went twice that Summer.) My Family increa&s;ing, I traded a little to Sea for their Support and Maintenance: And I can truly &s;ay, I carried on my Affairs and Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Fear of God, having an Eye, or Regard there|in, more to his Glory, than to my own Intere&s;t. We had a rough Pa&s;&s;age to this I&s;land (in the fir&s;t Voyage) and were forced, by Di&s;tre&s;s of Weather, to ca&s;t &s;ome of our Goods into the Sea; and the Storm being very violent, &s;ome of the Seamen thought we &s;hould be de|voured by the Waves; and as for me, they had &s;hut me up in the Cabin alone, all in Darkne&s;s, and the Water came in &s;o that they were forced to take it out in Buckets.<NOTE PLACE="marg">At Sea.</NOTE> When the Storm was a little over, the Ma&s;ter came to me, and a&s;ked,
<Q>How I did all alone in the Dark?</Q>
I told him, <HI>Pretty well</HI>; and &s;aid to him, <HI>I was very willing to die, if it &s;o plea&s;ed God:</HI> And indeed I did expect no other at that Time. After this great Storm was over we arrived at <HI>Bermudas</HI> in a few Days;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bermudas.</NOTE> but going into the Harbour the Bottom of the Ve&s;&s;el &s;truck the Rocks, but we got well in; for which I was thankful to the Almighty. I &s;tay'd on the I&s;land about a Month, and had &s;everal Meetings, to &s;ome of which, many came who were not called Friends. They were all &s;ober, and &s;ome well &s;atisfied; and the People of the I&s;land generally received me lo|vingly, and were very kind to me. <HI>(Our Ancients, who bore he Burden and Heat of the Day, met with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Treatment. I tenderly de&s;ire that we who come up after them, may be truly humble and thankful to the Almighty for all his Mercies!)</HI></P>
<P>By Rea&s;on of my outward Affairs, I had Oppor|tunities with &s;ome Per&s;ons of great Note and Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="83" REF="006297_0096_1028571B48BCC160">
on this I&s;land; and &s;ometimes opened the Principles of Friends to their Satisfaction; &s;ome of them cold me,
<Q>They never under&s;tood &s;o much concerning our Friends before; and if what I &s;aid was true, they had been mi&s;informed.</Q>
Divers &s;uch Opportunities I had with &s;everal on this I&s;land, there being but very few of our Society.</P>
<P>The&s;e are called the <HI>Sommer I&s;lands,</HI> or <HI>Bermudas,</HI> there being many little I&s;lands in the mid&s;t of the Main I&s;land, in Form like a Hor&s;e-&s;hoe, and are about two Hundred Leagues Di&s;tance from the Capes of <HI>Dela|ware.</HI> It is rare to &s;ee Hail, Snow, or Ice there.</P>
<P>After I had done my Bu&s;ine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.</NOTE> and had been for &s;ome Time on the I&s;land, I had a ready and comfort|able Pa&s;&s;age Home, where I was joyfully received.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little Stay at Home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bermudas.</NOTE> I went the &s;econd Time (that Summer) to <HI>Bermudas,</HI> and then al&s;o I had &s;ome Meetings, and did &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s on the I&s;land. It was my con&s;tant Care, that my worldly Affairs &s;hould not hinder me in my religious Concern for the Good of Souls. It happened at this Time there was a mighty Hurricane of Wind, &s;o that it blew many Hou&s;es to the Ground, and very many Trees up by the Roots, and rent divers Rocks a&s;under, which I was an Eye-Witne&s;s of: Tho' it is to be ob|&s;erved, that tho&s;e Rocks in the <HI>Sommer I&s;lands,</HI> are not &s;o hard as in &s;ome other Parts of the World, par|ticularly to the Northward; for here they &s;aw them with Saws, and cut them with Axes like Wood. I was told there were &s;ixty Sail of Ve&s;&s;els then at the&s;e I&s;lands, and all drove on Shore but three, and ours was one of the three that rode out the Storm; for which I was truly thankful. In this great Storm, or Hurricane, &s;everal Sloops (there being no Ships) were driven upon dry Land, &s;o that after the Storm was over, one might go round them at High Water, and &s;everal blown off the dry Land into the Water. One that was ready to be launch'd, tho' fa&s;tened
<PB N="84" REF="006297_0097_102857AFC9ECC580">
on the Stocks with two Cables and Anchors put deep in the Ground, yet the Violence of the Wind blew her into the Water, and da&s;hed her all to Pieces.</P>
<P>About this Time the <HI>Bermudas</HI> People had got a va&s;t Trea&s;ure of Silver and Gold, out of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wrecks; and at a Meeting which I had with a pretty many People on the Fir&s;t Day of the Week before the Hurricane, or Storm of Wind, it came weightily on my Mind to exhort them <HI>Not to be lifted up there|with, nor exalted in Pride: For I declared to them, that the &s;ame Hand that took it from the</HI> Spaniards, <HI>could take it from tho&s;e who had now got it out of the Sea; and if he plea&s;ed, by the &s;ame Way; which was a Storm that ca&s;t away the Ships going from</HI> Spain. <HI>And indeed &s;o it happened the &s;ame Week; for it was reckoned by Men of Experience and Judgment, that they had la&s;t more by the Storm, than they had gained by the Wrecks of the Spaniards.</HI> A &s;ober old Man (not of our Profe&s;&s;ion) told me the next Day after the Hurri|cane was over, that what I &s;poke in the Meeting was &s;oon come to pa&s;s: And he added, I was a true Pro|phet to them. Many Hou&s;es that were not blown down, were uncovered. My Landlord's Hou&s;e being old, &s;everal thought it would be down; but by the good Providence of God, it was one of them which &s;tood. I was in my Store, which &s;tood al&s;o; tho' I expected every Minute when it would have been blown down. It was by the Mercy of God we were pre&s;erv'd, and not for any Merit of ours. I intreated the Lord in the mid&s;t of this great Wind, that he would plea&s;e to &s;pare the Lives of the People; for many of them being Seafaring Men, were very unfit to die; at which Time I thought I was &s;en&s;ible of the An&s;wer of my Prayer, and he was plea&s;ed to be intreated for them: For, notwith&s;tanding the Violence of the Storm, and the great De&s;truction it made, yet not one Man, Wo|man, or Child, nor Creature was lo&s;t, that I heard of in all the I&s;land, which was to me very admirable.
<PB N="85" REF="006297_0098_102857B3C54D1610">
The Friend of the Hou&s;e came to me after the Storm abated, and &s;aid,
<Q>The Lord had heard my Prayers for them.</Q>
Altho' they could not by any outward Knowledge, know that I had prayed for them, yet they had a Sen&s;e given them, that I was concerned for them before the Almighty; which indeed was true. <HI>Oh! that we may never forget the merciful Vi&s;itations of that High and Lofty One, who inhabits Eternity!</HI></P>
<P>While I was on the I&s;land I was invited to, and kindly entertained at the Hou&s;es of &s;everal of the Gen|try, and at the Governor's, who invited me &s;everal Times to his Hou&s;e: And once I was with him, and &s;ome of his chief Officers at Dinner, with divers of the fir&s;t Rank, where I was treated very kindly; and after Dinner the Governor's Practice was to drink the King's Health, and he hoped I would drink it along with them.
<Q>Yes, <HI>&s;aid the re&s;t at the Table,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chalkley</HI> (as they called me) will &s;urely drink the King's Health with us.</Q>
So they pa&s;&s;ed the Gla&s;s, with the King's Health, till it came to me; and when it came to me, they all looked &s;tedfa&s;tly at me, to &s;ee what I would do (and I looked as &s;tedfa&s;tly to the Al|mighty) and I &s;aid to them, I love King <HI>George,</HI> and wi&s;h him as well as any Subject he hath; and it is known to Thou&s;ands that we pray for him in our Meetings and A&s;&s;emblies for the Wor&s;hip of Almighty GOD: But as to drinking Healths, either the King's, or any Man's el&s;e, it is again&s;t my profe&s;&s;ed Principle, I looking on it to be a vain, idle Cu&s;tom. They re|plied,
<Q>That they wi&s;hed the King had more &s;uch Subjects as I was; for I had profe&s;&s;ed a hearty Re|&s;pect for him:</Q>
And the Governor and they were all very kind and friendly to me all the Time I was on the I&s;land.</P>
<P>After I had fini&s;hed my Concerns I embarked in the Sloop <HI>Dove</HI> for <HI>Philadelphia</HI> (&s;he being con&s;ign'd to me in the former and this Voyage.) It being often calm and &s;mall Winds, our Provi&s;ion grew very &s;canty.
<PB N="86" REF="006297_0099_102857B54B016DB8">
We were about twelve Per&s;ons in the Ve&s;&s;el, &s;mall and great, and but one Piece of Beef left in the Barrel; and for &s;everal Days, the Wind being contrary, the People began to murmur, and told di&s;mal Stories about People eating one another for Want of Provi&s;ions; and the Wind being &s;till again&s;t us, and, for ought we could &s;ee, like to continue, they murmured more and more, and at la&s;t, again&s;t me in particular (becau&s;e the Ve&s;&s;el and Cargo was con&s;ign'd to me, and was under my Care) &s;o that my inward Exerci&s;e was great about it; for neither my&s;elf, nor any in the Ve&s;&s;el, did imagine that we &s;hould be half &s;o long as we were on the Voyage: But &s;ince it was &s;o, I &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider|ed the Matter&punc; and to &s;top their Murmuring, I told them they &s;hould not need to ca&s;t Lots (which was u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es) which of us &s;hould die fir&s;t, for I would freely offer up my Life to do them Good. One &s;aid, "God ble&s;s you, I will not eat any of you." Another &s;aid, "He would die before he would eat any of me;" and &s;o &s;aid &s;everal. I can truly &s;ay, on that Occa&s;ion, at that Time, my Life was not dear to me, and that I was &s;erious and ingenuous in my Propo&s;iti|on: And as I was leaning over the Side of the Ve&s;&s;el, thoughtfully con&s;idering my Propo&s;al to the Company, and looking in my Mind to him that made me, a very large Dolphin came up towards the Top or Surface of the Water, and looked me in the Face; and I called the People to put a Hook into the Sea, and take him, for here is one come to redeem me (&s;aid I to them;) and they put a Hook into the Sea, and the Fi&s;h rea|dily took it, and they caught him. He was longer than my&s;elf: I think he was about &s;ix Foot long, and the large&s;t that ever I &s;aw. This plainly &s;hew'd us that we ought not to di&s;tru&s;t the Providence of the Almighty. The People were quieted by this Act of Providence, and murmured no more. We caught enough to eat plentifully till we got into the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Delaware. Thus I &s;aw it was good to depend upon tho

Almighty, and rely upon his eternal Arm; which, in a particular Manner, did pre&s;erve us &s;afe to our de&s;ired Port, ble&s;&s;ed be his great and glorious Name, through Chri&s;t for ever!</HI></P>
<P>I now &s;tay'd at, and about Home, for &s;ome Time;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia, Maryland, New Jer|&s;ey.</NOTE> after which I was concerned to vi&s;it Friends in &s;everal Places, and in the adjacent Provinces, as <HI>Maryland, New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> &amp;c. and was at many Marriages and Fu|nerals, at which, many Times, we had good Oppor|tunities to open the Way, and al&s;o the Nece&s;&s;ity to be married to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the great Bridegroom of the Soul; and al&s;o to exhort the People to con&s;ider and prepare for their latter End and final Change; which many Times was &s;anctified to divers Souls, and the Lord's Name was glorified, who is worthy thereof.</P>
<P>In the Year 1717 I went into <HI>Maryland,</HI> to look after my Affairs in that Province; and as I travelled I had divers Meetings at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and at <HI>Bu&s;h-River,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Notting|ham.

The&s;e Remarks are not intend|ed to &s;et up Man, or exalt Fle&s;h, but to &s;tir up others to come up to the Work of Chri&s;t in their Generation: All the Glory and Godline&s;s of Man is but at the Gra&s;s, which &s;oon withers, without we dwell in the Root of true Religion, and holy Life of Chri&s;t; and that God may have the Glory of all his Works, is the End of all the Labours and Travels of the Servants and faith|ful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Tenth Month, 1717, divers Con&s;iderations moving me thereto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes a Voyage to <HI>Bar|bados.</HI></NOTE> I took a Voyage to <HI>Barbados,</HI> in the Snow Hope, <HI>J. Curtis,</HI> Ma&s;ter, and from thence to <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>London</HI>; partly on account of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and hoping once more, if it plea&s;ed God, to &s;ee my aged Father, my Brother, Relations, and Friends; which Voyage I undertook in the &s;olid Fear of God. I de&s;ired the Concurrence of my Wife, and my Friends and Brethren of the Meeting to which I did belong, in this Undertaking, the which I had in a general Way, and the good Wi&s;hes and Prayers of many Particulars, with a Certificate from our Monthly Meeting, &s;ignifying their Unity with my Conver&s;ation and Mini&s;try, and pre&s;ent Undertaking: And I felt the Love and Goodne&s;s of God therein, but in many Re|&s;pects it was a great Cro&s;s to me, as the leaving my be|loved Wife and Children, and many of my dear Friends, whom I loved well in Chri&s;t: And the Cro&s;&s;ing of the Seas always was trouble&s;ome to me, being &s;ickly at Sea, e&s;pecially in windy or &s;tormy Weather; and the Con|finement was wor&s;e to me for the Time than a Pri&s;on; for it would be much ea&s;ier to me to be in Pri&s;on on Land, upon a good Account, than in Pri&s;on at Sea,
<PB N="89" REF="006297_0102_102857BFB7E38690">
I always looking on a Ship to be a perilous Pri&s;on, tho' my Lot was to be much therein: And as for my natural Life, I always gave it up when ever I went to Sea; and I thought that was the lea&s;t Part of the Hard&s;hip, never putting much Value thereon; and I think I had rather die at any Time, than go to Sea, it being &s;o contrary to my Nature and Di&s;po&s;ition, as well as Inclination: But to Sea I went, for the Rea&s;ons mentioned, and got from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> the fir&s;t Night in &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el, and to <HI>El&s;inburgh</HI> next Day, where we lay for a fair Wind about two Days; and when the Wind was fair, we &s;ail'd to <HI>Bombay-Hook,</HI> where we met with two other Ve&s;&s;els bound out to Sea, who waited al&s;o for the Wind. We lay there two Nights, and then on a Fir&s;t-Day Morning &s;et Sail, the Weather being bitter cold, and the Ice very thick on the Sides of our Ve&s;&s;el, and on our Ropes. The &s;ame Day that we left <HI>Bombay-Hook</HI> we got out to Sea, took in our Boat, and went on our Way;<NOTE PLACE="marg">At Sea.</NOTE> and in four or five Days we got into warmer Weather.</P>
<P>In this Voyage I wrote &s;omething of the <HI>Common Prayer,</HI> u&s;ed by &s;ome of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Conver&s;ations were very loo&s;e and corrupt, which I entitled, <HI>One truly tender Scruple of Con&s;cience, about that Form of Prayer called the</HI> Common Prayer, <HI>as u&s;ed by the Church of</HI> England <HI>and her Members,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this our Voyage we &s;aw &s;everal Ships, but &s;poke with none; and in twenty-&s;even Days from our Capes we arrived at <HI>Barbados,</HI> and came to an Anchor in <HI>Carli&s;le-Bay.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbados.</NOTE></P>
<P>I had been twice in <HI>Barbados</HI> before, but this was the quicke&s;t Pa&s;&s;age by one Day. Here I was loving|ly and tenderly received by my Friends. I took my good Friend, <HI>Jo&s;eph Gamble</HI>'s Hou&s;e, for my Quar|ters, mo&s;t of the Time whil&s;t I &s;tay'd on the I&s;land; and I vi&s;ited Friends Meetings &s;everal Times over,
<PB N="90" REF="006297_0103_102857C1423CBD18">
there being five of Friends Meeting-Hou&s;es in the I&s;land, and our Meetings were &s;ometimes large and open.</P>
<P>Our Stay was longer here than we at fir&s;t expected, by Rea&s;on of a great Drought, they having no Rain for more than a Quarter of a Year, which was a great Hindrance to Trade on the I&s;land. While I was this Time in <HI>Barbados</HI> our ancient Friend <HI>George Gray</HI> died. I was at his Funeral, at which there were many People; and on this Occa&s;ion we had a large Meeting in our Meeting-Hou&s;e at <HI>Speights-Town,</HI> where I had a &s;ea|&s;onable Opportunity with the People, opening to them the Nece&s;&s;ity of preparing for, and thinking of their latter End; and pre&s;&s;ed them earne&s;tly thereto. They were generally attentive and &s;ober, and &s;ome were broken into Tenderne&s;s. While we were burying the Friend there appeared a di&s;mal Cloud hanging over the I&s;land, &s;uch an one as I never &s;aw before: It was to my thinking, of the Colour of the Flame of Brim|&s;tone, and I expected there would have been a great Storm, or &s;ome mighty Gu&s;t, and much Rain, they having had very little for many Weeks, or &s;ome Months: but it went over, and there was no Rain, nor Wind, as I remember. Soon after &s;ome People came in from Sea, and they &s;aid, that from that Cloud it rained A&s;hes; and they brought &s;ome of the &s;ame to the I&s;land, &s;ome of which A&s;hes I have now before me: The ta&s;te of them &s;eems to me to be a little &s;ulphurous, and have &s;ome glittering Particles in them, in Colour and Smell I think they differed little from common A&s;hes. Here|in the Almighty and Infinite Being &s;ignally &s;hewed his Mercy and Favour to poor Mortals; for had not his Mercy prevented, he could as ea&s;ily have rained down the Fire as the A&s;hes, who rained down Fire and Brim|&s;tone on the Cities and Inhabitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Go|morrah,</HI> for their Pride and Idlene&s;s, much of which abounds among the Inhabitants of <HI>Barbados,</HI> the Peo|ple being very luxurious. Oh! may the luxurious In|habitants

of that I&s;le, as al&s;o all others, con&s;ider their Ways and Doings, and not provoke the Great Lord, the Sovereign of Heaven and Earth, as many of them do by their evil Lives, and voluptuous Conver&s;ations; and that they would ki&s;s his Son, tho' not with a <HI>Ju|das</HI>' Ki&s;s, of Profe&s;&s;ion, or &s;peaking well or fair of him only, but with divine Love manife&s;ted through Obedience, while his Wrath is but a little kindled a|gain&s;t them before it break out into a Flame.</P>
<P>After this Funeral I was &s;ent for to <HI>Bridge-Town,</HI> to the Burial of a Ma&s;ter of a Ship, a young Man, who was very fre&s;h and well a few Days before. There was a great Appearance of People, and I was pretty largely opened in the Meeting, on the Words of the Prophet, where he &s;ays, <HI>All Fle&s;h is Gra&s;s, and all the Goodline&s;s thereof, is as the Flower of the Field. The Gra&s;s withereth, the Flower fadeth, becau&s;e the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: Surely the People is Gra&s;s. The Gra&s;s withereth, the Flower fadeth; but the Word of our God &s;hall &s;tand for ever,</HI> I&s;aiah lx. 6, 7, 8. And I treated of this Word, its Wonderfulne&s;s, its Duration, and its Work in Man: As al&s;o of the fad|ing Con&s;titution of mortal Man, tho' young and &s;trong, as that young Man was a few Days before, who&s;e Corp&s;e was then before us.</P>
<P>I was at divers other Burials on this I&s;land, which indeed doth prove a Grave to many New-comers, it being a hot Climate, makes tho&s;e who are not accu|&s;tomed to it, very thir&s;ty, and by Rea&s;on of the ex|tream Heat, it is not ea&s;y to quench their Thir&s;t; &s;o that what is called moderate Drinking, throws many Strangers into a violent Fever, and oftentimes is the Cau&s;e of their Death. I note this as a Caution to any who may tran&s;port them&s;elves there (that may &s;ee this) that they may &s;hun that Danger, which might be a|voided by drinking cool Drinks, of which they have many Sorts very plea&s;ant, <HI>viz.</HI> Cane, Sugar-reed, and
<PB N="92" REF="006297_0105_102857C8D1C82F60">
White Sorrel, Pine, Orange, and divers others: And I advi&s;e &s;uch, as they love their Health, to refrain from drinking much hot Drinks or Spirits.</P>
<P>I &s;aw &s;everal Curio&s;ities in Nature in this I&s;land, which among the great Numbers of the Works of God, do &s;hew forth his Prai&s;e and Glory. One to the Leeward Part of the I&s;land, which is called the Spout, &s;ends up a va&s;t Body of Water into the Air, occa&s;ioned by a great Cavity in the Rocks under the Water, which may be &s;een in calm Weather, when the Sea is low; but when the Wind blows (a great Body of Water being pent in a large hollow Place) it forces it up into the Air, &s;ometimes ten, fifteen, and twenty Yards high, according as the Strength of the Wind is more or le&s;s, and makes a Report like a Can|non, or Thunder a great Way off. I believe I have &s;een it ten or twelve Miles out at Sea. I was al&s;o at a Place called <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Cave, which we got to with &s;ome Difficulty, in going down the &s;teep and craggy Rocks. There is on the outward Part next the Sea, a very large, vaulted Place in the Form of a Half-circle, a|bout one hundred Foot high, as near as I could gue&s;s. In this large Vault, behind a Rock, is the Mouth of the Cave, not the Height of a Man at the fir&s;t Entrance; after one is in, a few Yards, one may walk upright com|fortably, the Bottom being pretty plain and &s;mooth for about a hundred Yards, and then we come into a large Cave which is form'd archwi&s;e, and about ten or fifteen Yards high, as we thought, being much higher in the Middle than the Sides, but almo&s;t as regular as if it had been done by Art, which we beheld with Ad|miration, by the Help of Wax-Candles, and other Lights, that we made and carried for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When I had done my Bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Barbados,</HI> having been about thirteen Weeks there, our Ve&s;&s;el being load|ed, we &s;ailed from thence the 10th of Second Month, 1718, for <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>In this Voyage I wrote &s;ome Things which opened in my Mind at Sea, upon that excellent Sermon of Chri&s;t's upon the <HI>Mount,</HI> as it is recorded in the Holy Scriptures of the New Te&s;tament, in the vth, vith, and viith Chapters of the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Matthew,</HI> but have &s;ince heard that the &s;ame is much better done by an abler Hand; and therefore it may &s;uffice here to give the Advice, which in the Cour&s;e of my Travels I have often had occa&s;ion to do, that the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity &s;hould frequently read this Sermon, and be careful to practice the &s;ame; that they may not only be Chri&s;tians in Name, but in Deed, and in Truth.</P>

Fifth Days on board all the Voyage, we came all &s;afe and well to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.</NOTE> thro' the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, where I &s;tay'd with my Family a few Months, and then took another Voyage for <HI>Barbados</HI> and <HI>Britain.</HI> I was under &s;ome Concern more than ordinary, as to the Sup|port and Well-being, or Accommodation of my Fa|mily, the Circum&s;tances thereof being a little changed by the Increa&s;e of Children, remembring the Words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>That tho&s;e who had not that Care and Concern, were wor&s;e than Infidels</HI>; my Lord Je&s;us (who&s;e Servant I profe&s;s my&s;elf to be) al&s;o &s;aying, <HI>It is better to give than receive</HI>; wherefore an Opportu|nity offering of the Con&s;ignment of a Ve&s;&s;el and Car|go (the Snow <HI>Hope, Warner Holt,</HI> Ma&s;ter) to <HI>Bar|bados,</HI> and from thence to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o to make Returns Home again, for <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I embraced it; tho' with Reluctance, to leave my very loving Wife, Children, and Friends, all whom I tenderly loved and re&s;pected. I al&s;o had in my Eye an Hope, thro' the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, to obtain wherewith to accommodate my Friends, who were Strangers and Pilgrims in this World for Je&s;us Sake, as I al&s;o had been my&s;elf; and that they might find a Place or Home, and Refre&s;h|ment under my Roof; not to Exce&s;s, but to Comfort and Edification; which in Sincerity, is all the Gran|deur I covet or de&s;ire in this World: So after due Con&s;ideration, on the &s;econd Day of the Eleventh Month, 1718, we &s;et Sail from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> many Friends taking their Leaves and Farewel of us for that Voyage. Thus with Hearts full of Love and Good-Will, we parted with our Friends, and went down the River about five Miles, where we ran aground, but got off next Tide, and next Day came to an Anchor at <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> On the 4th Day of the Month we &s;et Sail, and got to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> about the 11th Hour; it being Meeting-Day, we went to Meeting, where our great Lord was plea&s;ed in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure to own us with his living Pre&s;ence, and comfort us with his

Love; ble&s;&s;ed be his Holy Name! In the Morning we &s;ailed to <HI>Reedy I&s;land,</HI> where we &s;tay'd for the Tide, and in the Night our Cable parted, which we knew not till the Morning, and then we had gone from the Place where we anchored, above a League: But tho' the Ve&s;&s;el drove about the River, yet &s;he did not go on Ground. We dropp'd our other Anchor, and &s;ent the Boat to &s;eek for that which was parted from us, but could not find it until the next Tide, and then could not get it up, and were unwilling to go to Sea without it; which occa&s;ioned us to &s;tay &s;everal Tides before we could get it: At la&s;t with much Difficulty we weigh'd it, our Men's Clothes being much frozen; for it was very cold, and froze extremely hard. After this we went down to <HI>Bombay-Hook,</HI> where was al&s;o another Ve&s;&s;el going out to Sea. Next Day the Wind was again&s;t us, and it &s;nowed much, and froze hard; and that Night the River and Bay was filled with Ice as far as we could &s;ee, and it drove very hard again&s;t our Ve&s;&s;el, &s;o that we wi&s;hed for Day; for we thought &s;ometimes it would have torn her Bows into Pieces; but our Anchor and Cable held us, we thought, to a Miracle (for which we were thankful to the great Keep|er of all tho&s;e who put their Tru&s;t in him.) When the Tide turned for us we got up the Anchor, and &s;o let her drive with the Ice down the Bay: The other Ve&s;&s;el did the &s;ame. It was now dangerous moving, go which we would. The Ve&s;&s;el in Company with us attempted to go back again, but &s;eeing that we did not, as we &s;uppos'd, came to Anchor again, and we both went down the Bay together; and the Wind &s;pring|ing up fair, we got clear of the Ice in &s;ome few Hours Time; but by this Hindrance we could not get to Sea that Day, but were obliged to come to Anchor near the Middle of the great Bay of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and the Night being fair and calm, we rode it out &s;afely, which if it had been windy Weather, would have been dan|gerous. Early in the Morning (of the 9th Day of the

We al&s;o &s;hut up our Cabin Windows, and were to&s;&s;ed exceedingly, and I was very Sea-&s;ick; and we began in this Storm to fear falling on the Rocks of <HI>Bermudas,</HI> which we were near, as we imagined, and the Wind &s;et right on the I&s;land. But when we had pa&s;&s;ed the Latitude of <HI>Bermudas,</HI> we met with fair Weather and Winds (all the remaining Part of our Pa&s;&s;age being plea&s;ant and comfortable) by which I was led to con&s;ider the Vici&s;&s;itude which Mortals may ex|pect while on this un&s;table terraqueous Globe, which is full of Changes; and I &s;trongly de&s;ired to be rightly prepared for that World which is eternal, and its Joy and Felicity permanent; at which ble&s;&s;ed Port, I hope in God's Time, thro' his Grace, &s;afely to arrive. Thus thro' Storms, Tempe&s;ts, Ice, and Snow, we left tho&s;e frozen Climes, and cro&s;&s;ed the Tropick of <HI>Can|cer</HI> (between which, and that of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> there is neither Fro&s;t nor Snow at Sea, at any Time of the Year) and the Wind always within a &s;mall Matter one Way, <HI>viz.</HI> Ea&s;terly (except in Hurricanes and vio|lent Storms, which &s;ometimes they have in tho&s;e Parts of the World.)

<P>Our Friends there &s;ignified to their Brethren, that they were glad of my Company, and that I was &s;er|viceable to them, tho' I came upon Bu&s;ine&s;s. My Hand, when Need required, was to my Bu&s;ine&s;s, but my Heart was, and I hope is, and ever &s;hall be, freely given up to &s;erve the Lord, in that Work whereunto I believe he has called me. We have Liberty from God, and his dear Son, lawfully, and for Accommo|dation's Sake, to work or &s;eek for Food or Raiment; tho' that ought to be a Work of Indifferency, com|par'd to the great Work of Salvation. Our Saviour &s;aith, <HI>Labour not for the Meat which peri&s;heth, but for that which endureth for ever, or to eternal Life:</HI> By which we do not under&s;tand, that Chri&s;tians mu&s;t neglect their nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ions, and their outward Trades and Callings; but that their chief Labour, and greate&s;t Concern ought to be for their future Well-being in his glorious Kingdom; el&s;e why did our Lord &s;ay to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Children, have you any Meat?</HI> They an|&s;wered, No; and he bid them <HI>ca&s;t their Nets into the

Sea, and they drew to Land a Net full of great Fi&s;hes</HI>; and Fi&s;hing being their Trade, no doubt but they &s;old them, for it was not likely they could eat 'em all them|&s;elves. Al&s;o the Apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>He that doth not take care of his Family, is wor&s;e than an Infidel:</HI> And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> (the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI>) wrought with his Hands, even while he was in his Travels, and in the Work of the Go&s;pel; and others ta&s;ted of the Benefit of his Labour naturally, as well as &s;piritually. It is al&s;o written, <HI>That he that will not work, &s;hall not eat.</HI> By all this, and much more, which might be noted, it appears that we not only have liberty to labour in Moderation, but we are given to under&s;tand, that it is our Duty &s;o to do. The Farmer, the Trade&s;|man, and the Merchant, do not under&s;tand by our Lord's Doctrine, that they mu&s;t neglect their Calling, or grow idle in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, but mu&s;t certainly work, and be indu&s;trious in their Callings. We all ought to under&s;tand, that our Hearts and Minds ought to be out of the World, or above the Nature and Spirit of it. 'Tis good and profitable for both Soul and Body, rightly to di&s;tingui&s;h between earthly and heavenly Things, and to be careful how they mix the one with the other; for it is an eternal Truth, that God and Mammon cannot dwell together, or join together in the Heart. If our Love is more to God, than the Creature, or to Heaven than Earth, then will he dwell in us, and with us: But if our Love is more to the Creature than to Chri&s;t, or to Earth than Heaven, then will he not dwell with us, but will leave us to our|&s;elves; for the Lord Omnipotent will not admit of any Rival.</P>

About the Latitude of 33 North, our Ma&s;ter, <HI>Warner Holt,</HI> &s;eeing a Scool of Porpoi&s;es about the Ship, tho' he was not very well, and had not been for mo&s;t of the Voyage, he took his Harping-Iron, and &s;truck one of them, and we took him into the Ve&s;&s;el, out of which we got ele|ven Quart Bottles of Oyl; and we mo&s;t of us eat heartily of this Fi&s;h, which agreed with our People very well. They fry'd his Liver for our Me&s;s, of which I eat a large Meal, which was well-ta&s;ted, and eat more like fre&s;h Beef than Fi&s;h. I make this Me|morandum of it, that if any &s;hould take them when their Provi&s;ions are &s;carce, they may eat freely without Danger, according to our Experience. When we had been at Sea about three Weeks, being near the La|titude of 40 North, and about the Longitude of 42, tho' it was in the mid&s;t of Summer, we &s;aw an I&s;land of Ice, at which we all marvelled, and judged that there had been a &s;evere cold Winter in tho&s;e Lati|tudes on the Land of <HI>America.</HI> When we &s;aw this I&s;land of Ice we judged our&s;elves not far from the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> Hitherto we had ea&s;y Gales of Wind, and many Calms, which made our Pa&s;&s;age &s;eem long to us.

<P>We had in this Voyage Weekly Meetings for wor|&s;hipping the Almighty, in which the Great Lord both of Sea and Land, was plea&s;ed greatly to manife&s;t his Name and Truth among&s;t us, for which my Soul of|ten &s;ecretly and openly ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed his Divine and Glorious Name and Truth; for he bore up my drooping Spirit, &s;o that I could truly &s;ay with the Royal P&s;almi&s;t (not becau&s;e he &s;poke it only, but al&s;o being an experimental Witne&s;s thereof) <HI>The Floods have lifted up, O Lord, the Floods have lifted up their Voice: The Floods lift up their Waves.

<P>It being Winter-Time we &s;ailed to the Southward, and got into warm Weather, and were on our Pa&s;&s;age &s;even Weeks and &s;ome odd Days from Land to Land, in which Time we &s;aw &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;poke with

We met with rough Seas and high Winds in the latter Part of our Pa&s;&s;age, till we came to the Capes of <HI>Delaware,</HI> which we all rejoiced to &s;ee, and we had a plea&s;ant Pa&s;&s;age up the Bay and River to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where I had once more a comfortable Meeting with my dear Wife and Family, which I grate|fully acknowledged as a high Favour from the Hand of the Almighty.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1721.</NOTE>In the Year 1721, <HI>Thomas Lightfoot</HI> and I, with <HI>William Browne,</HI> went to a Meeting at <HI>Bu&s;h-River,</HI> and going over <HI>Su&s;quehannah-Ferry,</HI> the People were fiddling and dancing.

<Q>Yes, there was no doubt of it.</Q>
<HI>Well,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>and &s;o do I; and I will tell you what he &s;ays concerning Dancing,</HI>

which &s;poil'd their Sport, and they went away, and we went on ours towards the Meeting; and a good Meeting it was! and we after it returned by Way of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and had a Meeting there, and one at <HI>New-Garden,</HI> and &s;o on to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> I was from Home about a Week, and travelled in this Journey about 150 Miles, and was well &s;atisfied therein.</P>
<P>In the Years 1721 and 1722, I went &s;everal Jour|neys, and had many large Meetings, travelling many Hundreds of Miles, of which I neglected to keep a particular Account, hardly thinking what I did worth recording; but divers of my Friends in many Parts of the World, put me upon &s;omething of this Nature, to which, at length, I gave up, and found &s;ome Bene|fit and Satisfaction therein, in looking back and con|&s;idering the Dealings of God with me in my Youth and upwards.</P>
<P>From <HI>Philadelphia</HI> I went to the General Meeting at <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shrew&s;|bury.</NOTE> in <HI>Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> where I heard of <HI>J.

Some few Days after this Meeting at <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> I vi&s;ited Friends on <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and returned Home again, having travelled about 300 Miles. In my Stay at, and about Home, I wrote &s;omething concerning <HI>Perfection,</HI> in an&s;wer to a namele&s;s Author; as al&s;o &s;omething concerning <HI>Pre|de&s;tination,</HI> or <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1722,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penn&s;yl|vania.</NOTE> I went back in the Woods to <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the <HI>Great Swamp, Perkiomy, Manaha|towny,</HI> and <HI>Oley,</HI> where I had Meetings, travelling over great Mountains, from which we could &s;ee many Miles. I travelled in this Journey about 150 Miles, and re|turned Home in about two Weeks; and after &s;taying &s;ome Time at Home, and vi&s;iting neighbouring Meet|ings, I went to the Yearly Meeting of Friends on <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> which Meeting was very large, many People (not of our Per&s;ua&s;ion) being there, and were very &s;ober. Many Things were opened in the Love of Chri&s;t, and his great Love was largely declared to that great Congregation. The Parable concerning the <HI>Prodigal Son,</HI> came before me to &s;peak of to the Peo|ple in a very moving Manner, and &s;trongly to invite the Youth to lay hold of the Love of the Father in his Son, to poor Souls: And indeed it is a wonder|ful Parable, &s;etting forth the infinite Love of the great Lord of all to his poor Creatures. Many were affect|ed and reached to at this Meeting, and the Almighty was prai&s;ed and glorified, who alone is worthy.</P>
<P>From thence I went and had a Meeting at <HI>New-York,</HI> and then &s;et forward to <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> where we had a comfortable Meeting; <HI>Naaman,</HI> the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian,</HI> being much the Subject of that Days Work: And that one Thing loved and e&s;teemed more than Chri&s;t, whatever it be, is to be avoided, and the People warned to be careful to cleave clo&s;e to the God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> (&s;piritual <HI>I&s;rael</HI>) and to give up all which is

contrary to his Nature, and to take up Chri&s;t's Cro&s;s, and follow him: For it is tho&s;e who follow him in the Regeneration, that are to be Heirs of his Kingdom.</P>
<P>In this Year al&s;o I was at the Burial of our Friend <HI>Jonathan Dicken&s;on,</HI> at which we had a very large Meeting, he was a Man generally well-beloved by his Friends and Neighbours. In this Meeting a Pa&s;&s;age (he had often told me in his Health) was brought to my Remembrance, I think, worthy to be recorded to the End of Time, which is as followeth:
<Q>It hap|penned at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> that two young Men were at Dinner with <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and divers other People of Account in the World, and they were &s;peaking about Earthquakes (there having been one in that Place formerly, which was very dreadful, ha|ving de&s;troyed many Hou&s;es and Families.) The&s;e two young Men argued that Earthquakes, and all other Things, came by Nature, and denied a &s;uper|natural Power, or Deity; in&s;omuch that divers &s;ur|prized at &s;uch wicked Di&s;cour&s;e, and being a&s;hamed of their Company, left it; and at the &s;ame Time the Earth &s;hook, and trembled exceedingly, as tho' a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch Trea&s;on again&s;t its Sovereign and Creator, who&s;e Foot&s;tool it is: And when the Earth thus moved, the Company which remained were &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed, that &s;ome run one Way, and &s;ome ano|ther, but the&s;e two athei&s;tical young Men &s;tay'd in the Room, and <HI>Jonathan</HI> with them, he believing that the Providence of Almighty God could pre|&s;erve him there, if he plea&s;ed, and if not, that it was in vain to fly; but the Hand of God &s;mote the&s;e two young Men, &s;o that they fell down; and, as <HI>Jonathan</HI> told me, he lay'd one on a Bed, and the other on a Couch, and they never &s;poke more, but died &s;oon after. This was the amazing End of the&s;e young Men:</Q>
A dreadful Example to all A|thei&s;ts, and di&s;&s;olute and wicked Livers. <HI>Oh! that young People might be warned, that the Hand of God
<PB N="107" REF="006297_0120_102857F09F73BE18">
might be upon them for Good, and that they would ten|derly be concerned for their Salvation!</HI></P>
<P>On the 30th of the Fourth Month, 1723,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1723.</NOTE> my tenth Child, named <HI>Thomas,</HI> died about Midnight (having before buried nine.) It was &s;ome Exerci&s;e to me thus to bury my Children one after another; but this did a little mitigate my Sorrow, that I knew that could I have all Things relating to them according to my De|&s;ire; could I &s;ee them grow up to be &s;ober Men and Women, well married, have a Competency in the World, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet it was &s;afer and better for them, and they more out of Danger, being taken away in their Infancy and Innocency; and I fervently begged of the Almighty, that he would be plea&s;ed to take them away while Innocent, rather than that they &s;hould live to be vicious or unrighteous Men and Women, and to bring Scandal on the holy Name of Chri&s;t, and upon our Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion; which Con&s;iderations did mighti|ly tend to &s;ettle and quiet my Mind in my &s;orrowful Exerci&s;e. <HI>The Great Lord of all &s;anctify the Sorrows and Afflictions of his People and Children, and grant them the Fulfilling of that ble&s;&s;ed Portion of Holy Scrip|ture, that all Things &s;hall work together for the Good of them that love and fear God: Even &s;o be it, &s;aith my Soul!</HI></P>
<P>In the Sixth Month of this Year I removed from the City into the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Removes to <HI>Frank|fort.</HI></NOTE> to a &s;mall Plantation I had at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> in order to be more retired, and for Health's Sake, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> finding &s;ome declining in my bo|dily Strength, which I take to be very much owing to the &s;evere Colds and Hard&s;hips I have &s;u&s;tained in my long and hard Travels, more e&s;pecially in the Wilder|ne&s;s of <HI>America</HI>; for without Vanity I may &s;ay, that I always lov'd Temperance, and have been &s;ometimes zealou&s;ly concerned to preach again&s;t Intemperance; and tho' I cannot now take &s;o long Journeys as I have formerly, my Spirit earne&s;tly travels for the Welfare

of <HI>Sion,</HI> and the Peace and Pro&s;perity of all tho&s;e who love, fear, and &s;erve, God, and believe in his Son.</P>
<P>On the Sixth Day of the Eighth Month, it plea&s;ed God to give me another Son, whom I named <HI>George,</HI> after my Father, Brother, Nephew, and King; and tho' this Name is now a great Name among Men, I con|&s;ider'd that no Name can pre&s;erve Life, &s;o I gave him up to the Will of him who gave him to me, and de|&s;ire, if I have no Name thro' Children to Po&s;terity, I may have a Name in the Lamb's Book of Life, which I have ever e&s;teem'd far above a Name among&s;t Men.</P>
<P>After my Removal to this Place I was not idle, but vi&s;ited neighbouring Meetings, and in the Eighth Month I went to <HI>Shrew&s;bury</HI> General Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shrew&s;|bury.</NOTE> where there were many Hundreds of People, and the Truth declared had good Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Minds of many; &s;ome after Meeting, who were not of our Society, ac|knowledged to the Truth, and that they were glad they were there. In this Meeting I was concerned for the Welfare of Mankind, and the Exaltation of the Holy Name of the Almighty, to declare the univer&s;al Love of God to Man, from &s;everal Texts of Holy Scripture, as that Pa&s;&s;age concerning <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>E&s;au,</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and &s;omething concerning the Objection made again&s;t us, the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> that we do not acknowledge the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God; for tho' we believe that the Scriptures came by Divine In&s;piration, yet we are clearly convinc'd by their Te&s;timony, and by the Spirit of Truth in our Hearts, that Chri&s;t is the eternal Word of God, by whom all Things were made and created, and do &s;till exi&s;t.</P>
<P>From <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> with divers other Friends, I rode to <HI>Cro&s;wicks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro&s;wicks.</NOTE> where, on the Fifth Day, we had a very comfortable Meeting, in which the ancient Love and Goodne&s;s of our heavenly Father was with us to the tendering our Hearts into Tears of Joy, &s;ome of us being likewi&s;e affected in Remembrance of the Good|ne&s;s of the Almighty to us, in the Meeting we had in

this Place under the Trees about twenty-five Years &s;ince. The great Subject of Faith and Works was &s;poken to; as, that the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;eem'd to lay too much Stre&s;s on Works, and the <HI>Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts,</HI> and others, too little: But our Principle led us to join both together; the Almighty having joined them together, none ought to &s;eparate them. This Subject of Faith and Works having been much in Debate a|mong&s;t profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, it is on my Mind here to mention a few Things deduced from the be&s;t Autho|rity:</P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is, <HI>Without Faith, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God,</HI> Heb. xi. 6.</P>
<P>Second, <HI>Faith is the Gift of God.</HI></P>
<P>Third, <HI>Faith works by Love.</HI></P>
<P>Fourth, <HI>Faith is the Evidence of Things not &s;een, and the Sub&s;tance of Things hoped for.</HI></P>
<P>Fifth, <HI>Faith without Works is dead.</HI></P>
<P>Sixth, <HI>The Ju&s;t live by Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Seventh, <HI>You believe</HI> (or have Faith) <HI>in God, believe al&s;o in me,</HI> John xiv. 1.</P>
<P>And the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> &s;peaks excellently concerning the Power of Faith, and the mighty Won|ders wrought by it. <HI>Note,</HI> this living, &s;aving, true, and Divine Faith, mu&s;t be in the Heart, thro', and in Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Son of the Living God, who is, and always will be, the Author and Fini&s;her of it in every true Believer.</P>
<P>After I came from <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> I vi&s;ited divers neighbouring Meetings, and &s;ome in <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> County,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Che&s;ter</HI> County.</NOTE> where I had Meetings for nine Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, &s;ome of which were very large (particularly at <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Go&s;hen</HI>) in which I was opened to exhort them to keep to that plain, hone&s;t Way of Life and Conver&s;ation, which our Fathers and Elders were found in, and to remind them of the Sufferings they endur'd for their Te&s;timony to the ble&s;&s;ed Truth, in the fir&s;t breaking forth thereof in the la&s;t Age; and I was concern'd to &s;how them, that

the Almighty, who had ble&s;&s;ed us with plenty of tem|poral Ble&s;&s;ings, would continue the &s;ame to us, if we were careful to live in his Fear; but that otherwi&s;e, we might expect his Judgments for Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>And after my Return, I continued about Home for &s;ome Time, it being Winter Sea&s;on, and bad Travelling, and I not &s;o capable of travelling as formerly: But I had great Peace and Tranquility of Mind, in that I had freely given up my youthful Days to &s;erve my Creator, and the &s;ame Love and Zeal was yet fre&s;h and warm in my Heart, for the Glory of his Great Name; and I &s;till have a full Re&s;olution through his Strength and Grace to &s;erve him, the great Lord of all, all my Days, according to the Light and Strength given to me.</P>
<P>Our Yearly Meeting at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> this Year was large, in which our Friend <HI>Benjamin Kid,</HI> from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> being with us, had great Service. I cannot for|get a Concern which was upon me at this Meeting, that the univer&s;al Love of God, through Chri&s;t, might prevail among&s;t Mankind, and to pre&s;s Friends to ma|nife&s;t to all People the Influence thereof, by their ex|emplary Lives and Conver&s;ations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1724.</NOTE>In the Second Month, 1724, I went into <HI>New-Jer|&s;ey</HI> as far as <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shrew&s;|bury.</NOTE> where, on a Fir&s;t Day, we had a large Meeting, to general Satisfaction; and the next Day we had another, wherein the Love and Good|will of God, thro' Chri&s;t was opened freely to the People, and our Duty to forgive one another was large|ly treated of; and it was plainly &s;hewn, that without forgiving others, we could not be forgiven of God, as Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>If ye forgive Men their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, your heavenly Father will al&s;o forgive you: But if ye forgive not Men their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es,</HI> Matth. vi. 14, 15, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and much more to the &s;ame Effect on that Sub|ject; as al&s;o Chri&s;t's An&s;wer to <HI>Peter,</HI> who a&s;ked, <HI>How oft a Man &s;hould forgive his Brother if he tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed

And again Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>If thy Brother tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee &s;even Times in a Day, and &s;even Times in a Day turn again unto thee, &s;aying, I repent, thou &s;halt forgive him,</HI> Luke xvii. 4. Which hard-hearted People think a great Hard&s;hip, but Chri&s;t's Cro&s;s mu&s;t be taken up, and born daily, if we will be his Di&s;ciples and Fol|lowers in Deed, and in Truth, as well as in Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>After we had reconciled &s;ome Differences at <HI>Shrew&s;|bury,</HI> we went to a Place called <HI>Mene&s;quan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mene&s;|quan.</NOTE> and had a good, open Meeting, and mo&s;t of the People of that Place were there. It was a good Time, and I hope the Opportunity will not &s;oon be forgotten by divers that were there. From this Place we travelled to <HI>Cro&s;|wicks,</HI> and had a good Meeting.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro&s;wicks.</NOTE> After Meeting a Friend told me that &s;ome would &s;ay,
<Q>I &s;poke by in|formation, becau&s;e I had opened &s;ome Matters which were exactly to the State and Condition of &s;ome there:</Q>
But I knew nothing of their State and Condition, otherwi&s;e than as it was then immediately opened in my Mind; neither had I been told any Thing concerning them directly or indirectly: And from thence we travelled to <HI>Burlington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burling|ton.</NOTE> where the Monthly-meeting of our Friends had de&s;ired that I would be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to help to end a Difference which had happen|ed through Mi&s;take, and continued for about &s;even Years (&s;ince the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion was given) and thro' Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, our Hearts being filled with the Love of Chri&s;t, we &s;o prevailed upon the differing Per|&s;ons, that they gave each other Satisfaction, with Hopes that they &s;hould live in Love for the future; and Friends of the Place greatly rejoiced at the End of that Dif|ference. As I went along this Town, &s;ome Friends told me of a religious People &s;ome few Miles di&s;tant, whom they de&s;ired I would have a Meeting with. I de&s;ired them to &s;ee if it would be granted, and let me
<PB N="112" REF="006297_0125_102857FD39DDFAE8">
know; which was done, and we had a Meeting, and were kindly received, and the Divine Nature of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t was freely opened to them, and in great Love we parted from one another. I travelled in this Journey about two Hundred Miles; and when I came Home, my dear Wife and Family gladly re|ceived me with Hearts full of Love: And this Te&s;ti|mony I think proper, for &s;everal &s;olid Rea&s;ons, to leave behind me of my virtuous and loving Wife, that &s;ince we were married, &s;he never hindred me in that Service my great Ma&s;ter called me unto, in all the Time of our living together: We always parted, for the Sake of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, in pure Love, and in the &s;ame Love we always met again.</P>
<P>Soon after this Time I met with &s;everal great Lo&s;&s;es by Sea and Land, and my&s;elf and my little Daughter were dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, &s;o that our Recovery &s;eem'd doubt|ful; yet thro' the Mercy of God, we both recovered, for which I prai&s;e his Name.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Stay at Home, I was again moved in the Love of Chri&s;t, to vi&s;it the General Meetings of <HI>Duck-Creek</HI> and <HI>Salem.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duck-Creek.</NOTE> At <HI>Duck-Creek</HI> we had a large and &s;atisfactory Meeting. From <HI>Duck-Creek</HI> I ap|pointed a Meeting at <HI>George's-Creek,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">George's-Creek.</NOTE> which was a good Meeting. The next Morning we went over to <HI>El&s;in|burgh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cohan&s;ie.</NOTE> and &s;o on to <HI>Cohan&s;ie,</HI> where I met with two of my Fellow-labourers in the Work of Chri&s;t, <HI>Thomas Lightfoot</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Kid.</HI> We had a Meeting to|gether at <HI>Cohan&s;ie,</HI> in which the People were exhorted to Sobriety and ju&s;t Dealing. The contrary of both is too obvious at &s;uch Times as Fairs; there being di|vers of the Fair People there as well as others, and the Nature of Chri&s;t's Work in the Heart, was &s;omewhat &s;poke to, but not &s;o open a Meeting as &s;ome others, the People thereaway being too &s;lack and dull as to Religion. Next Day we had a Meeting at <HI>Alloways-Creek,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alloways-Creek.</NOTE> where we all three had &s;ome pretty clo&s;e Work; and from thence we went to the General Meeting at

<HI>Salem,</HI> which was larger than common, on account of &s;aid Friend (<HI>Benjamin Kid</HI>'s) being there; who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salem.</NOTE> in the Love of Chri&s;t, came from <HI>England,</HI> to vi&s;it the Churches in this Part of the World. There were &s;o many Friends and others here at this Time, that &s;ome Hou&s;es were &s;o filled, that there was not Room for all that came to lodge there.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frankfort.</NOTE> After this Meeting I return'd Home and in a few Days, went into <HI>Che&s;ter-County,</HI> and travelled above 100 Miles; and when I came Home I under|&s;tood, that &s;ome for Want of a true Sen&s;e of the Work of Chri&s;t, had been cen&s;uring me for my much Tra|velling and hard Labour in the Work of the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; tho', by the &s;ame Rule of judging, the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, and our ancient Friends, who travelled much, cannot e&s;cape their Cen&s;ure; for in all my Travels, I have had an e&s;pecial Regard to the Unity of the Brethren, and never knowingly went a|broad without it: <HI>But let this Caution be recorded for the In&s;truction of all &s;uch forward Judges; let them be careful of judging Chri&s;t's Servants, le&s;t their Words become their Burden:</HI> Judge not, that ye be not judged (<HI>&s;aith our great Lord</HI>) for with what Judgment ye Judge, ye &s;hall be judged.</P>
<P>Soon after my Return from <HI>Che&s;ter-County,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abington.</NOTE> I was at a Marriage at <HI>Abington,</HI> which was one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn I have been at; and on the 15th of the Third Month, at the Youth's Meeting at <HI>Germantown,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">German|town.</NOTE> to my great Satisfaction; and on the 23d of the &s;ame Month, I went to the General-meeting of Mini&s;ters and Elders at <HI>Burlington</HI>; at which Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burling|ton.</NOTE> &s;everal Things relating to the Go&s;pel-mini&s;try, were declared; as its being a free, a clear, and a powerful Mini&s;try, reaching to the Con&s;cience, and Convincing of the Dan|ger of continuing in Sin: And divine Charity was much recommended, without which, <HI>All Mini&s;try is but as &s;ounding Bra&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. From this Meeting I went with <HI>Walter Herbert,</HI> into <HI>Bucks-County,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ne&s;hami|ny.</NOTE> and at <HI>Ne&s;haminy</HI> we had an open, tender Meeting. From thence I went

to <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and was at a Marriage of a Son and Daughter-in-law of <HI>Thomas Canby</HI>'s. The Meeting was large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bucking|ham.</NOTE> and Friends well &s;atisfied; and it was ob|&s;ervable, tho' I was very hoar&s;e, thro' a Cold I had taken, and could hardly &s;peak in common Conver&s;ati|on, yet it was much taken away in my Mini&s;try, &s;o that I was carried thro' the Service to our Admiration, for which I was truly thankful. After this Meeting I returned Home with true Satisfaction, &s;uch as is much more valuable than Silver and Gold, two mighty Idols in the World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Frankfort. North-Wales.</NOTE>After a little Stay at Home I went on a Fir&s;t Day to <HI>North-Wales</HI> or <HI>Gwinnedd,</HI> where was a pretty large Meeting, many young People being there, to whom I was concern'd to &s;hew, that Chri&s;t is the Way by which we mu&s;t come into the true Church, thro' Re|generation, and that all who invent other Ways are Thieves and Robbers. I rode twenty-five Miles that Day, and next Day came to <HI>Frankfort,</HI> and was at the Burial of an ancient Friend, <HI>Joan Orpwood,</HI> at which our Friend, <HI>John Salkeld</HI> was, with whom I was the next Day at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> at our Third-Day Meeting, which was a good Meeting.</P>
<P>On the 4th Day of the Fourth Month, intending &s;oon to take a Journey to <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> I thought it a proper Time to alter my Will, as I had kept one by me for divers Years before, con&s;idering the Uncertain|ty of Life.

<P>On the 10th of the Fourth Month, 1724, I had a Concern to write the following Epi&s;tle to Friends in the I&s;land of <HI>Barbados.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Frankfort,</HI>
<DATE>10. 4<HI>th Mon.</HI> 1724.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the tender Love of God, our heavenly Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Epi|&s;tle to Friends in <HI>Barbados.</HI></NOTE> and of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, do I, your Bro|ther, at this Time greet you, and wi&s;h you Health and Salvation. Under&s;tanding by a concerned Friend, that of late &s;everal of our Friends are taken away from you by Death, a Concern came on my Mind to put you in Remembrance of your latter End, and of the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t; and al&s;o, of the Pro|&s;perity of his ble&s;&s;ed Light and Truth in your (in that Re&s;pect, poor, tho' in &s;ome others, rich and luxu|rious) I&s;land: The Po&s;terity of many that have been taken away there, as well as in divers other Places, having gone a&s;tray; and that it may not be &s;o with the&s;e who are left behind, let a weighty Con|cern come upon you. O dear Friends! let your Practices and Expre&s;&s;ions, manife&s;t to the ri&s;ing Gene|ration, that the Welfare of their Souls, more than of their Bodies, is at Heart with you; and do not indulge them in that which you in your&s;elves were convinc'd to be of an evil Tendency, when your Hearts were fir&s;t reached by the Power of Truth. How many Youths have been lo&s;t, thro' the Loo&s;e|ne&s;s of the Example of their Elders, and thro' an undue Indulgence of them in Vanity, Folly, Pride, and Idlene&s;s! Woful Experience doth but too much
<PB N="116" REF="006297_0129_1028580899DAC258">
declare that they are many: O they are many in|deed, who have been lo&s;t by &s;o doing! Wherefore, dear Friends, clear your&s;elves of your Children; and, if they will ob&s;tinately go a&s;tray, faithfully bear your Te&s;timony again&s;t them, in Life, Doctrine, or Ex|pre&s;&s;ions and Conver&s;ation, which will Witne&s;s for you when you are dead and gone, and your Heads laid in the &s;ilent Grave. Thus will your Youth, thro' the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, and your Endea|vours, come up in your Places, or at lea&s;t you will be clear, and their Blood will be upon their own Heads. A pure, &s;trict Watch is required of you in Conver&s;ation, in all tho&s;e Relations: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That God may be glorify'd. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That your Chil|dren may be exampled. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That your Neigh|bours may be edify'd, or built up in pure Religion: And <HI>Fourthly,</HI> That you may die in Peace with him that created you, and died for you; remembring the ble&s;&s;ed Doctrine of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <HI>Let your Light &s;o &s;hine before Men, that others, &s;eeing your good Works, may glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI> And again; <HI>You are as a City &s;et on a Hill, which cannot be hid.</HI> And as you thus train up your Chil|dren in the Way which they &s;hould go, when they are young, you may have Rea&s;on to hope they will not depart from it when they are old; for many have been convinced of the Truth, as it is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thro' the good Conver&s;ation of his Followers. And how can we expect to die well, if we do not live well? Or can we expect the An&s;wer of, <HI>Well done,</HI> if we are not in the Practice of doing well?</P>
<P>And I do de&s;ire and earne&s;tly exhort Friends to read the Holy Scriptures, and wait to feel the Power from which they &s;prung, thro' the holy Writers; and al&s;o to teach them to their Children. And, dear Friends, let me prevail with you in the Love of God and his dear Son, to keep clo&s;e to your Meetings for the Wor&s;hip of Almighty God, and for the
<PB N="117" REF="006297_0130_1028580BAB54C600">
well ordering of your Society; and do it in the meek Spirit, for that is of great Price with the Lord; and when in your Meetings, get into a religious Exerci&s;e, and lively Concern for God's Glory, and your Souls Peace and Pro&s;perity. I pray the holy Lord of Sabbaoth, to open your Hearts to him in the Reading of this little Epi&s;tle, as mine is open to you, my beloved Friends, that you and I may be edified (tho' outwardly &s;eparated) as we were when together; and if we &s;hould never meet more in this World, that we may meet in the Kingdom of God, where we may never part more. <HI>Amen. Hallelujah,</HI> &s;aith my Soul!</P>
<P>I de&s;ire this may be copied and read at the Clo&s;e of one of each of your particular Meetings, and, if it could be readily, in every Family of Friends; to all whom is my very dear Love in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e Servant I am, and hope to be to the End, and I am an entire Lover of Souls, and a Well-wi&s;her of <HI>Sion</HI>'s Pro&s;perity</P>

<P>After this Meeting I had &s;ome Affairs which called me into <HI>Che&s;ter-County,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Che&s;ter-County.</NOTE> and on the Road my Hor&s;e gave a &s;udden and violent Start out of the Path, and threw me down, and before I could get up again, he &s;truck my Face, and on my right Eye with his Foot, being newly &s;hod, which &s;tunn'd me for the pre&s;ent; but as &s;oon as I opened that Eye which was un|hurt, I perceiv'd that I lay on my Back, under my Hor&s;e's Belly, with my Head between his fore Feet. He &s;tood &s;till, and I got on my Hands and Knees, the Blood &s;treaming out of my No&s;e and right Eye, and while I was bleeding, a Man and Woman came by, and &s;tay'd till I had done Bleeding, and &s;aw me mount|ed on my Hor&s;e again. I went forward, being about two Miles from the Hou&s;e I intended to go to, and after riding about a Mile, I met with a Friend that knew me, and was &s;urprized to &s;ee me &s;o bloody, and went with me to <HI>Randal Maylin</HI>'s, (a faithful, hone&s;t Friend, who was upwards of eighty Years of Age, and had &s;uffered much for his Profe&s;&s;ion of the Truth in his younger Years) where &s;everal tender-hearted, motherly Women dre&s;&s;ed my wounded Eye. I was truly thankful to the Lord for his Providence towards me in this Deliverance, among many others, which he in his Goodne&s;s hath vouch&s;afed to me. I &s;tay'd at this Friend's Hou&s;e, three Nights and mended apace, and the Friend accompanied me to my Hou&s;e at <HI>Frank|fort,</HI> where my loving Wife, with &s;ome Surprize, re|ceived me very affectionately; and thro' her Care and continual Application, I recovered, that I could &s;ee pretty well with Spectacles, which I was obliged to u&s;e for &s;ome Months. <HI>Such Accidents plainly &s;hew us the Nece&s;&s;ity of preparing for &s;udden Death, as we know not when, or how, we may go off the Stage of this Life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="006297_0134_1028581A9A5D9A70">On the 25th of Fifth Month, I received a Letter from a Per&s;on in the County of <HI>Burlington,</HI> relating to <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m,</HI> to which I made An&s;wer as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THY Lines I received la&s;t Night, in the Per|u&s;ing of which, there was a Chri&s;tian Love in my Heart towards thee, tho' unknown by Face, and I have much Freedom of Mind to an&s;wer thine, ac|cording to thy Reque&s;t, and my &s;mall Ability. <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, We are near in Sentiments to each other in the grand Chri&s;tian Principle of &s;aving Religion, which is the Work of the Holy Spirit of Chri&s;t upon the Soul, for that is the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> which is Chri&s;t's, and is truly &s;aving, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m being but one, which is with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with &s;piritual Fire or Water; <HI>John</HI>'s being the Element, or Figure; and CHRIST's being the Spirit, Power, and Divine Sub&s;tance, and is to be with the Church of Chri&s;t, and with his true Mini|&s;ters to the End of the World. <HI>Secondly,</HI> In An&s;wer to thy <HI>Query, Was Water-Bapti&s;m</HI> (that is, the Ele|ment) <HI>not commanded by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, in</HI> Matth. xxviii. 19? I an&s;wer, I believe not. My Rea&s;on is this, becau&s;e the Holy Gho&s;t, or Spirit, is menti|oned in the Text, or that Command, in expre&s;s Words, and Water is not; and therefore we omit going into outward Water, and for other Rea&s;ons as followeth. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That Water-Bapti&s;m, which was <HI>John</HI>'s, was practi&s;ed by the Apo&s;tles, is true; but it was not practi&s;ed by Chri&s;t, who, no doubt, would have done it if it had been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry; for he di&s;dained not to wa&s;h his Di&s;ciples Feet, a much more de&s;picable Office than that of the Bapti&s;mal Ceremony: So becau&s;e Chri&s;t did not him&s;elf practi&s;e it, nor, as we conceive, command|ed us to go into material Water, we therefore for|bear it. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> That the Apo&s;tles did baptize with Water, we deny not; and that they were cir|cumci&s;ed,
<PB N="122" REF="006297_0135_1028581C42D52C88">
and did circumci&s;e, is al&s;o undeniable. Now, mu&s;t we circumci&s;e becau&s;e the Apo&s;tles did, and were them&s;elves circumci&s;ed? Con&s;ider that care|fully, and I hope that will give thee &s;ome Sight or Light into, or concerning the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Water-Bapti&s;m, which was <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m, and was glori|rious in its Day and Di&s;pen&s;ation, in pointing at Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m, until it came, which was the Sub&s;tance, and was with &s;piritual Fire, and &s;piritual Water, and will continue for ever. To Chri&s;t, and his Bapti&s;m, I heartily direct thee for further In&s;truction, <HI>in whom</HI> is Light, and that Light is the Life of Men, or <HI>Life, and that Life the Light of Men.</HI></P>
<P>And further, I would write a little of my own Thoughts concerning Water-Bapti&s;m, and on &s;ome Texts of Scripture, being Chri&s;t's own Words, <HI>viz. He that believeth, and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved, and he that believeth not, &s;hall be damned,</HI> or condemned, <HI>Mark</HI> xvi. 16. Now this mu&s;t needs be under&s;tood of the Spirit's Bapti&s;m; for it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, or believe, that all who are bap|tized with the Element Water, are &s;aved, or all who are not baptized with Water, are damn'd; therefore it is the Spirit's Bapti&s;m, that all profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity ought to come unto to Witne&s;s Salvation. Again, Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</HI> or of Heaven, <HI>Mat.</HI> iii. 5. This divers will have to be a Mixture of the Element Water, and of the Spirit; but Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the Fle&s;h profiteth nothing: The Words that I &s;peak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life,</HI> John vi. 63. <HI>And that which is born of the Fle&s;h, is Fle&s;h, and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit,</HI> John iii. 6. According to which Doctrine, I have Faith to believe, that outward, fle&s;hly, or elementary Water-Bapti&s;m, profits little or nothing to the Soul. Again, Why &s;hould the Water in that Place be under&s;tood of the Element,
<PB N="123" REF="006297_0136_10282E176F7E14C0">
any more than the Fire in the other, <HI>viz. To be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire?</HI> Since Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>My Words they are Spirit and Life.</HI> Remember the Well of Water that &s;prings up to eternal Life in the Believers: Remember the Water that Chri&s;t gave, who&s;oever drank of it was never to thir&s;t more. This is all Spiritual, which the carnal Mind cannot comprehend or enjoy, but is witne&s;&s;ed by the &s;piri|tual Man. And further, if we con&s;ider what Con|fu&s;ion there is in the World about this Water-Bap|ti&s;m, it may well put a tender-&s;eeking Soul upon further Search into the Nature of holy, &s;aving Bap|ti&s;m. The <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> have one Way; the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> another; the <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> they have ano|ther; and all differ &s;o widely, that, generally &s;peak|ing, they will not wor&s;hip together; neither are they ever like to be reconciled, except they come to the Holy Spirit and Divine Power of Je&s;us, the good Saviour and precious Guide of Souls. That Saying of his hath often been a Comfort to me in deep Exerci&s;es and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Mind, when he &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come; but if I go away, I will pray to the Father, and he will &s;end the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, in my Name, and when he is come, he &s;hall lead you, and guide you into all Truth; he &s;hall take of mine, and give it unto you, and &s;hall bring all Things to your Remembrance, that I have &s;poken unto you.</HI> And that he was to convince the World of Sin; and that he &s;hall abide with you for ever. May the precious Gift of the Spirit be given to thee, and to all true Seekers of God, his Chri&s;t and Kingdom, is my real De&s;ire, and humble Prayer to the mo&s;t High.
[<HI>See the Four Evangeli&s;ts for this Promi&s;e, they not wording it alike.</HI>]</P>
<P>Having an&s;wered the mo&s;t of thy Letter, I would add a few Lines more, <HI>viz.</HI> I have known &s;ome
<PB N="124" REF="006297_0137_1028581E41F7A598">
who could not be &s;atisfied with Words about this Point of Bapti&s;m with Water, until Chri&s;t had by his Spirit given them Satisfaction in them&s;elves; and as thou comes more and more into clo&s;e Communion with his Grace and Spirit in thy own Soul, I hope thou al&s;o wilt have better Satisfaction than that of Words only. I have known &s;ome of the People called <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> who have been convinced of the Truth, according to our Way and Principle, to whom all the Writing, and Di&s;puting, and Reading, and Preaching, about this Point, could never give ample Satisfaction, until they had it inwardly and immedi|ately from Chri&s;t, manife&s;ted to them by his Holy Spirit in their Hearts, as afore&s;aid. Tho' I would not be under&s;tood to be again&s;t &s;atisfying one another as much as lieth in our Power, and as we find Open|ne&s;s in the Love of God and Chri&s;t. And further, I never under&s;tood that any of our Society were ab|&s;olutely again&s;t &s;uch practi&s;ing of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> who could &s;ee no further, or did really think in their Con&s;cience it was their Duty &s;o to do: But we believe, that we &s;ee beyond the Figure or Shadow, and are come to the Sub&s;tance, for the Rea&s;ons mentioned, and many more which mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> given. Several Treati&s;es have been written upon this Subject, one of which is very full (before we were a People) by <HI>William Dell,</HI> a wi&s;e and learned Man, and one who had a large Sen&s;e of the Power of God: And among us <HI>Barclay</HI>'s A|pology, and a Treati&s;e by <HI>John Gratton,</HI> who was a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Preacher, and one by <HI>Jo&s;eph Pike:</HI> And al&s;o here is a little Book of <HI>Thomas Up&s;her</HI>'s (a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Preacher before he came to join with us) which I &s;end thee, with whom I was well acquainted, as al&s;o with tho&s;e Men who &s;ub&s;cribed it. If thou applies thy&s;elf to <HI>Richard Smith,</HI> of <HI>Burlington,</HI> he is as like|ly as any I know to help thee to tho&s;e Books, all which are larger on the Subject, and have given Sa|tisfaction to Thou&s;ands about it; tho &s;ome, as I have

He is God Omnipotent, Omni|&s;cient, Omnipre&s;ent, the immortal Jehovah, and is God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever. And as a Servant of his, I recommend thee, with my own Soul, unto him for Pre&s;ervation and Divine Direction; for it is the great Work of Chri&s;t's true Mini&s;ters and Ser|vants, to direct the &s;eeking, travelling Souls to him; to whom, with the Father, and the eternal Spirit, be Glory, now, and evermore. <HI>Amen.</HI>&mdash;From thy a&s;&s;ured Friend in Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>The Per&s;on to whom I wrote this Letter, &s;ome Time after informed me, it gave him great Satisfaction.</P>
<P>After I had &s;tay'd at Home &s;ome Time, and pretty well recovered of the Hurt I had by my Fall,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> I vi&s;ited &s;ome Meetings about Home, as <HI>Philadelphia, Abing|ton,</HI> and <HI>Germantown.</HI> In &s;everal of tho&s;e Meetings I was concerned to exhort Friends, as our Meetings and Wor&s;hip was, in this Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> a Kind of national Wor&s;hip, to beware that they did not in|dulge them&s;elves in the Sins of the Nations, but to be careful to keep to the holy, &s;elf-denying Life of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>On the 5th of the Sixth Month, between the Hours of nine and ten in the Night, there was an Earthquake,
<PB N="126" REF="006297_0139_1028582563DAC5A0">
which divers People were very &s;en&s;ible of; and about this Time divers People were taken off with a violent Fever; and I was concerned in &s;everal Meetings to put the People in Mind of their Mortality, and Shortne&s;s of Time here; and al&s;o of the Uncertainty of it, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peedy Preparation for their final Change and future Well-being. In the afore&s;aid Month I was at our Youths Meeting in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where I was concerned to advi&s;e Parents to do ju&s;tly to their Children, in the divers Relations of a Child's State; to be ju&s;t in Correction, and to be &s;ure to give them Learn|ing, and train them up in Reading of the Holy Scrip|tures, <HI>they being able, thro' Faith in Chri&s;t, to make us wi&s;e to Salvation.</HI> I al&s;o was earne&s;t in Exhortation to the Youth, to obey and Honour their Parents, and to have a Care not to be di&s;obedient to their Fathers and Mothers. I had a Concern al&s;o to remind that large Congregation, that the Almighty had &s;tretched out his Arm of Power, with his Rod, and had given the People of this Land three Strokes therewith, as a gentle Admonition towards Heart-preparation, to meet him, and to prepare for their latter End, or final Di&s;&s;olution: Which was <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Sickne&s;s, or pe&s;ti|lential Fever, which carried off many of the People. <HI>Secondly,</HI> An Earthquake, of which divers in Town and Country were very &s;en&s;ible. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> A terri|ble Whirlwind, &s;uch as we never before heard of in this Land, that I remember. They were admoni&s;h|ed to take particular and &s;pecial Notice of tho&s;e gen|tle Strokes of the Divine Hand, for if he plea&s;ed he could as &s;oon take away many by Sickne&s;s, as a few, and if he plea&s;ed he could have made us a De&s;olation, as well as the Country about Mount <HI>Aetna,</HI> or <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> not very far from us; and he could al&s;o blow us away with a Whirlwind of his Wrath, and could as ea&s;ily have blown down all our City, as tho&s;e few Hou&s;es in the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="006297_0140_10282E134DA7B658">Next Day after this Meeting I went with <HI>John Rod|man</HI> to the Quarterly General-meeting of Wor&s;hip in the County of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> which was large and &s;atisfactory.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Che&s;ter</HI> County.</NOTE></P>
<P>The 25th of the Sixth Month I was at the Burial of the Wife of <HI>Richard Waln,</HI> a virtuous and good Woman. Some of her la&s;t Words were,
<Q>Some Mens Sins go before-hand to Judgment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fair Hill.</NOTE> and &s;ome follow after them; and that her Sins were gone be|fore, which was a great Comfort to her, now &s;he was going to leave the World.</Q>
It was a large Meeting, and a &s;ea&s;onable Opportunity that we had at the Funeral. The People were called upon to work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frankfort.</NOTE> while it was called To-day, <HI>Becau&s;e,</HI> as our Saviour &s;aid, <HI>the Night cometh, wherein no Man can Work.</HI></P>
<P>In this and the foregoing Year I met with various Trials and Exerci&s;es: As <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Great inward Poverty and Want. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Great Lo&s;&s;es in outward Affairs. And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The evil Spirits of divers &s;tirred up a|gain&s;t me, to report Fal&s;hoods concerning me, with many other &s;ore Exerci&s;es both inward and outward. As to the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I had often been try'd that Way, and found by Experience, that I mu&s;t wait upon God my Saviour, for fre&s;h and renewed Vi&s;itations from above; in which Exerci&s;e, I had always in the Lord's Time, Comfort from him, as by the &s;ame Exerci&s;e I had now the &s;ame Comfort al&s;o; but I thought it very long, and the Enemy did greatly endeavour to break in upon my Patience now more than u&s;ual: But my Heart &s;till de|pended in Faith and Hope upon the Lord my Re|deemer and Saviour, and in his Time he was plea&s;ed to help me, ble&s;&s;ed be his holy Arm and Power for ever! Many ble&s;&s;ed Saints and Servants of Je&s;us were brought to my Mind, who were in the like Condition, &s;o that I had a &s;ecret Joy in their Company (who met with the like in their Travels to the holy City.) <HI>Secondly,</HI> As to my outward Lo&s;&s;es, I thought with my&s;elf, peradven|ture it might be be&s;t for me: And I remembred that many, through the Increa&s;e of outward Riches, were
<PB N="128" REF="006297_0141_1028582DCCF43920">
exceedingly hurt as to their inward State; and tho' I (or any good Man) might be concerned for our Chil|dren, to get and leave &s;omething for them, yet I plain|ly &s;aw, that generally &s;peaking, much Riches doth much Hurt to Youth. This was a melancholly Ob|&s;ervation that I had made in my Life and Travels, and I &s;ee at this Day that it is an univer&s;al Di&s;temper (a very few excepted) wherefore I cry'd mightily to God that he would give to me and mine, the Gift of his Grace and Holy Spirit, whatever our Circum&s;tances might be in the World. In this al&s;o I &s;aw that Patience was an excellent Virtue, and that the Meek had the be&s;t Inheritance of the Earth, if they had ever &s;o little of it; and that true Happine&s;s did not con&s;i&s;t in earthly Things, which my Experience had largely taught me. And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to the ba&s;e and evil Treatment I met with (which was more than I had ever met with in all my Life before) great Endeavours were u&s;ed to le&s;&s;en my Reputation, as a Man and a Chri&s;tian; all which proved fal&s;e and fruitle&s;s, and in due Time my Inno|cence was made manife&s;t; and I con&s;idered that they could not u&s;e me wor&s;e than they had done my Lord and Ma&s;ter, and that the Devil was angry with any who endeavoured to dethrone him, and pull down his King|dom, at the Foundation of which, thro' the Help of my Ma&s;ter, I had many a Stroke or Blow, with &s;uch Weapons as he was plea&s;ed to furni&s;h me withal.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the Sixth Month, and the 1&s;t of the Se|venth Month, was the Quarterly and Youths Meeting at <HI>Burlington,</HI> at both which I was. At the Quarterly Meeting I was concerned to open to that Meeting, how all along tne Church of God was governed by his Spi|rit, in the Time of the Law, and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was an In&s;tru|ment therein; and that when it was too hard, and too much Work for <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> he was advi&s;ed to get the Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Elders; and that the &s;ame Power and Spirit of God that was with and upon <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> was upon the Elders who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the Affairs of the

Church, and Congregation of the Lord's People; &s;o that it was governed by God's Spirit, and is to be go|verned by the &s;ame &s;till, and not by the Will of Man, nor according to the Will of Man in his corrupt Na|ture. And when <HI>I&s;rael</HI> went from God's Power and Spirit, the Lord left them, but at la&s;t &s;ent to them his only begotten Son, our dear Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and he was, and ever is, to be Governor of his Church, <HI>thro' his Holy Spirit, which,</HI> he told his Di&s;ciples, <HI>he would pray the Father, and he &s;hould &s;end unto them, the Comforter, the Holy Gho&s;t, or Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, and he &s;hould abide with them for ever, and &s;hould lead and guide them into all Truth</HI>; which &s;weet and precious Promi&s;es that he made to them, the true Believers do witne&s;s to be ful|filled at this Day. Glory to his Name for ever, <HI>he is the wonderful Councellor, mighty Saviour, and Prince of Peace! of who&s;e Peace and Government there &s;hall never be an End, and upon who&s;e Shoulder the Go|vernment is to be for ever,</HI> for who&s;e Power and holy Spirit Friends were exhorted to pray and wait, and to be &s;en&s;ible of it in the Di&s;cipline and Government of the Church now in this Go&s;pel Day, in which is a bright|er Manife&s;tation of God's Love, thro' his Son, than in the Time of the Law. The Youth's Meeting was al&s;o large, and divers Te&s;timonies were born, by Way of Exhortation and Coun&s;el to the Youth. They were with much Tenderne&s;s advi&s;ed to take Coun&s;el of their Elders, and were &s;hewn how it fared with &s;ome young Men, who &s;lighted the Advice and Coun&s;el of the El|ders; and that one, when on a Dying-bed, cried out in the Bitterne&s;s and Agonies of his Spirit,
<Q>Oh! that I had taken the Coun&s;el and Advice of my Friends, for then I had not been here, nor in this Condition.</Q>
Youth were advi&s;ed to beware of keeping bad Com|pany, and &s;pending their precious Time in Taverns, which hath undone many fair and promi&s;ing Youths: And it was &s;hewn, how a <HI>young Man might clean&s;e his

<P>THINE dated the 11th of Tenth Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter from my Father.</NOTE> 1723, I received, and was very glad to hear of your Welfare, and that the Lord hath given you Children: And I pray the Almighty God that he may pre&s;erve them with you, that they may be a Comfort to you in your latter Days; and that if the Lord may be plea&s;ed to continue them with you, that they may, as they grow in Days, grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je|&s;us Chri&s;t; and that the Lord may be plea&s;ed to pre|&s;erve us all to the End of tho&s;e few Days we may have in this World, that then we may lay down our Heads in Peace and in full A&s;&s;urance of everla&s;ting Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s for ever and evermore.</P>
<P>I ble&s;s the Lord that he has pre&s;erved me &s;en&s;ible of his ble&s;&s;ed and Holy Spirit, whereby my Under|&s;tanding is indifferent clear and well, con&s;idering my Age; and the Lord in his great Loving-kindne&s;s I do feel to help me to my great Satisfaction, in my little Service for him.</P>
<P>Having this Opportunity by a Friend of your Town, was willing to let you hear of our Welfare and Health.

<P>IN this Year, 1724, I met with various Trials,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1724.</NOTE> Afflictions, and Tribulations; and had not the &s;ecret Hand of the Lord, which I felt underneath, bore up my Spirit from &s;inking (I think) I could never have waded thro' them.</P>
<P>I was now removed (as already related) into the Country, for Retirement, which I greatly loved and delighted in; but as &s;oon as I was a little &s;ettled there, the Enemy of all Good endeavoured to di&s;quiet my Repo&s;e, by &s;tirring up &s;ome bad People again&s;t me, who lived near, and in Time pa&s;t had &s;awn'd upon me: And, to add to my Afflictions, I lo&s;t a Ve&s;&s;el, in which, I &s;uppo&s;e, I had upwards of Five Hundred Pounds; and another Ve&s;&s;el came in almo&s;t a Wreck, in which I &s;uffered in my Intere&s;t &s;everal Hundreds

more, and a third I heard of, in which I had the like Lo&s;s; and about the &s;ame Time I had al&s;o a good new Barn burnt to the Ground in a few Minutes, &s;o that I was exceedingly &s;tripp'd that Way: And to add yet more to my Exerci&s;e, I was &s;orely afflicted with Sick|ne&s;s, having a Swelling in my Jaws, Mouth, and Throat, to that Degree that I could neither &s;peak nor &s;wallow for &s;ome Time, nor eat nor &s;leep for about &s;even Days (as I remember) without great Difficulty. What the Di&s;temper was, we could not be certain. Some &s;uppos'd it to be the Quin&s;ey, others an Impo&s;t|hume; al&s;o my little and only Daughter at the &s;ame Time was likely to die; and as for my own Part, I was very willing to go, if it &s;o plea&s;ed God; for I &s;aw thro' the Deceit of the World, and that the Friend|&s;hip of it was not permanent; and in my &s;ore Afflic|tions in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy, Mind, and Intere&s;t, it fared with me as with <HI>Job,</HI> for divers of my pretended Friends added to my Afflictions by undue Reflections; whom I pray the Lord to forgive for his Son's Sake!

<P>When I got a little well, &s;o that I could go to Meet|ings, I went to <HI>Germantown, Abington, Philadelphia,</HI> and <HI>Darby.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.</NOTE> My fir&s;t going abroad was to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where, on a Fir&s;t-Day, we had a large Meeting, and divers Things were opened in my Mind. I told them they had <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and JESUS CHRIST, who was ari&s;en from the Dead; for neither Death, Hell, nor the Grave, could detain the Lord of Life and Glo|ry. And I was opened to declare to them, that they had a great Advantage of the Coming of Chri&s;t, not only in his Appearance at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> but as he came to, and &s;poke to the Heart, by his inward and &s;piritual Ap|pearance; and that this Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation was by his Coming, made more con&s;picuous, bright, and glorious,

<SALUTE><HI>My dear Friends,</HI> Elizabeth Levis <HI>and</HI> Jane Fenn,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNDERSTANDING by our Friend, <HI>Grace Lloyd,</HI> that you have propo&s;ed your Intention of vi&s;iting tho&s;e few Friends in the I&s;land of <HI>Bar|bados,</HI> and that you meet with &s;ome Di&s;couragement inwardly and outwardly, therefore it is in my Mind to comfort and &s;trengthen you in &s;o great and good an Undertaking and honourable Work, as is that of the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, who, for our Sakes cro&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf abundantly beyond Expre&s;&s;ion, more than is po&s;|&s;ible for us to do for his Sake, or the Sake of his People, whom we may &s;o entirely love, as to lay down our Lives for his and their Sakes. But what is our Lives, to the Life of the only-begotten Son of God? And truly, we mu&s;t give them up often, if we have the Cau&s;e of Souls at Heart; and then he often gives them to us again, Glory to his holy Name for ever! As Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>He that will &s;ave his Life, &s;hall lo&s;e it, and he that will lay down his Life for my Sake and the Go&s;pel, &s;hall find it</HI>; which reacheth your Ca&s;e in this Undertaking. And indeed, &s;ome of our Lives, in our own Sen&s;e, is hardly worth mentioning, con&s;idering the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="006297_0150_1028571CF480FE88">And, dear Children of our heavenly Father, I may, thro' &s;ome good Experience, truly inform you, that there is much Openne&s;s in many People on that I&s;land, and good Encouragement I have had, from above, in my Vi&s;iting the People there; tho', true it is, the Inha|bitants, too generally, are Luxurious, and much given to Vanity: Yet I have this Seal in my Heart, that the Lord hath a Seed in that Place who de&s;ires to &s;erve him, and that Seed will &s;urely join with you in your Exerci&s;e, and you will be comforted one in another, and in the Lord. And that there are Dif|ferences among them, is al&s;o true; but they have the more Need of being vi&s;ited by &s;uch, who are, thro' their wi&s;e Conduct and healing Di&s;po&s;ition, likely to heal tho&s;e Breaches which are, or may be among them. Some, indeed, have gone among them, and have done Hurt, by a ra&s;h and turbulent Way of Management, and by &s;o doing, have rather made the Breaches wider, than by a meek and loving, as well as lowly Di&s;po&s;ition, le&s;&s;ened their Differences, and healed them.</P>
<P>And, tender Friends, tho' it may &s;eem hard for you in &s;everal Con&s;iderations, to give up to go to Sea, and al&s;o to divers who love you, and are nearly related to you, know ye, and &s;uch &s;o concerned, <HI>That the Lord is &s;tronger than the Noi&s;e of many Waters, and than the mighty Waves of the Sea.</HI> And I really believe that you, as well as my Soul (with the Servants of Chri&s;t) have, and will experience it to be &s;o, as <HI>David</HI> did, who&s;e Words they are.</P>
<P>I remember the Words of our great Lord and Ma&s;ter Je&s;us, when he &s;ent forth his Servants to preach his Word and Go&s;pel; <HI>I &s;end you forth as Lambs among Wolves.</HI> No que&s;tion but you, like innocent Lambs, before your Return (if it plea&s;e God to give you to us again) may meet with the Wolves Spirit, or the Spirit of the Bea&s;t, in &s;ome or o|thers among whom you may Travel; then will the

<P>And, dear Maidens, I look upon it as your Cro&s;s is great, you being two innocent, cha&s;t, young Wo|men, to give up your Names to cro&s;s the Sea, which I know is a great Cro&s;s to a cha&s;t Woman, or Man either, the Seamen, too generally, being rude, di&s;&s;o|lute People; &s;o your Crown will be great al&s;o. I have known that by keeping near to Chri&s;t, and his Truth and Power, there hath been a wonderful Re|formation divers Times in &s;everal of tho&s;e rude Sea|men; and &s;ome have been &s;o far convinced, as to be exceedingly Kind, and to &s;peak well of Friends and their Conver&s;ation, when it has been coupled with the Fear and Wi&s;dom of God. When I have gone to Sea I always found a religious and chri&s;tian Con|cern upon me, for the poor Sailors, the good Effects of which, have been much more than I may &s;peak of; but give this little Hint for your Encouragement and Information.</P>
<P>Well, dear Souls, if you go, I believe the Lord will go with you; and &s;ure I am, that my Spirit will go along with you, which will not hurt you, if it do you no Good And altho' my Exerci&s;es and Tribulations of late have been very great, both Spi|ritual and Natural, yet my very Heart within me affects the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, according to the be&s;t of my Under&s;tanding; and I heartily wi&s;h well to all my Fellow-Labourers, who are faithful, painful Ser|vants of Chri&s;t, and di&s;intere&s;ted, except as to the Intere&s;t which they de&s;ire in Chri&s;t and his Kingdom, for the Sake of which, they love not their Lives unto Death.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now take Leave, after putting you in Mind of remembring me, your poor Friend and Brother, when before the Throne you are &s;upplicating the Fa|ther of Mercies in Secret, even as my Heart is ten|derly

<P>SINCE I la&s;t &s;aw thee and conver&s;ed with thee, thou ha&s;t often been in my Mind, and thy Ex|erci&s;e has come before me; and not having an Op|portunity
<PB N="141" REF="006297_0153_1028572A2FAD7D78">
to conver&s;e with thee per&s;onally, I take this Way of communicating my Mind, hoping in Chri&s;t thou wilt reap &s;ome Satisfaction and Advantage there|by. I think I know thou art concerned for Chri&s;t's Cau&s;e, as al&s;o was that eminent Mini&s;ter <HI>Apollos, Yet was in&s;tructed more perfectly by good Aquila and Pri&s;|cilla.</HI> The Subject on which I have it in my Mind to write to thee, is the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which I believe to be very different from that which it is generally taken for, in mo&s;t Parts of the World, by many profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The greate&s;t Part of Chri&s;tendom, &s;o called, calls and elects their Mini&s;ters them&s;elves, and will not call them unle&s;s they have School-learning, altho' Chri&s;t called and cho&s;e unlearned Men, as to that Sort of Learning, and the Apo&s;tles were called, <HI>Not accord|ing to the Will of Man, but by the Revelation of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> And Chri&s;t thanked his Father that <HI>He had revealed the My&s;teries of his Kingdom to Babe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Sucklings.</HI> And the wi&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> (the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI>) admired at the Apo&s;tles, who &s;o wonder|fully preached Chri&s;t, and were &s;o wonderfully car|ried forth in their Mini&s;try, and yet few of them were Men of Learning; &s;o that the Call, Election, and Wages of Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters, is Spiritual, and not Carnal, and therefore their Mini&s;try is with Divine Life and Power, by which they are qualify'd for this Service without either Study or Premeditation: Tho' it is not denied, that Chri&s;t may &s;hew a Mini&s;ter be|fore-hand, what he &s;hall, or is to &s;peak, at &s;uch a Time or Place, as he may &s;ee meet; but that &s;tudy|ing or writing Sermons, and afterwards Preaching, or rather Reading them to the People, was, or is, the Practice of the true Mini&s;ters of Je&s;us, our great Lord and Ma&s;ter, is deny'd; of which, I do believe, thou ha&s;t a real Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall impart to thee &s;omething of my own Ex|perience for thy Edification in this great Work, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="006297_0154_1028572D2BCA28C8">
As in the Work of Conver&s;ion, or Regeneration, there is a Growth and Increa&s;e from the State of a Child to that of a Man in Chri&s;t, &s;o in the Work of the Mini&s;try, or Preaching the Go&s;pel, there is al&s;o a Growth from a Babe to an able Mini&s;ter, in all which the Power and Grace of the Holy Spirit mu&s;t be our Guide, our Help, and Support, keeping clo&s;e to which, we &s;hall increa&s;e in Divine Wi&s;dom and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound Judgment, and our Hearts and Under|&s;tandings will be more and more opened and inlarged. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid, <HI>When I was a Child, I &s;pake as a Child, under&s;tood as a Child, and thought as a Child</HI>; and yet he was an excellent Child of God, and Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and as he grew in his Gift, and Chri&s;t's Grace, he became a wonderful, &s;ervice|able In&s;trument in the Hand of God. Now a Child's State in the Mini&s;try is too much overlooked by ma|ny, &s;ome thinking to be Men, as &s;oon as they are brought forth into the Mini&s;try; and, according to my Ob&s;ervation, divers have been at a Lo&s;s, and &s;ome quite lo&s;t, for Want of a patient Continuing in Well-doing, and not waiting to feel a Growth and Increa&s;e from above, have gone on in their own Strength and Will, perhaps again&s;t the Advice and In&s;truction of a &s;ound and hone&s;t <HI>Aquila</HI> and <HI>Pri&s;|cilla,</HI> and have been hurt; and &s;ome, who had re|ceived a Gift, have had that &s;ame Gift taken from them, even by the Lord, who gave it them.</P>
<P>As I take it, a true Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, is to take no Thought what to &s;ay, but it will be given him in the &s;ame Hour that which he &s;hould &s;peak to the People (that is, in a general Way) and if it is not given from above, I believe he or &s;he ought to be &s;ilent; for they receive freely, if they do receive any Thing from Chri&s;t, and &s;o they ought freely to ad|mini&s;ter; and where little is given, little is required, all which is plain from Chri&s;t's own Words in the New Te&s;tament; and Chri&s;t's Cro&s;s is to be taken
<PB N="143" REF="006297_0155_102857300C724780">
up by his Mini&s;ters in their Preaching, as well as in their Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>It is a Practice which the Holy Scriptures have not acquainted us with, that the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould take a Ver&s;e, or a Line, out of the Holy Scrip|tures, and Write, or Study, before-hand, a Di&s;cour&s;e on it, and Preach it, or rather Read it, to the People. The holy Men of Old (as we read both in the Old and New Te&s;tament) &s;poke as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, and by it they were gifted for the Convincing, Converting, and Reforming the World, and for Comforting and Edifying of the Saints, quite contrary to the latter Practice of modern-reading Di|vines, who Di&s;pute, Write, and Preach, again&s;t the immediate and Divine Revelation of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and therefore cannot be of his Mini&s;ters, but mu&s;t be the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> and Mini|&s;ters of the Letter, and not of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, or of his Go&s;pel. And where the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>When I was a Child, I &s;poke as a Child,</HI> I take him to point at the being brought forth newly into the Work of the Mini&s;try, as well as the Work of Conver&s;ion, and that he u&s;eth them Expre&s;&s;ions by Way of Com|pari&s;on, and therefore I compare it thus: A Child when it fir&s;t begins or ventures to &s;peak, he &s;peaks but a few Words, and tho&s;e &s;tammering &s;ometimes, and its Judgment is weak, and mu&s;t be put upon Speaking by his Father over and over, if he be a backward Child, otherwi&s;e if he be forward, and &s;peaks too much, he is curb'd by a wi&s;e Father: And thus, according to my Ob&s;ervation, it hath plea&s;ed our heavenly Father to in&s;truct his Children in the Mini&s;try, and as a Child in Chri&s;t, I would &s;peak a little of my Experience unto the Child, or Children of God. When I fir&s;t felt a Nece&s;&s;ity on me to preach the Go&s;pel, I had but a few Sentences to de|liver, in great Fear and Tenderne&s;s, with &s;ome
<PB N="144" REF="006297_0156_102857319E0D67B8">
Trembling, with which my Brethren were generally &s;atisfied and edified; and after &s;ome Time I felt a Concern to preach the Go&s;pel in other Countries, and to other Nations (than that in which I was born) which to me was a very great Cro&s;s; but feeling the Woe of the Lord to follow me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n not giving up to it, I in &s;ome Time took that Cro&s;s up, for Chri&s;t's Sake and the Go&s;pel's: And in Taking it up, I ex|perienc'd the Truth of the Apo&s;tle's Doctrine, <HI>That the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is the Power of God unto Salva|tion, to every one that believeth,</HI> Rom. i. 16. Thus, thro' a continual Labour and &s;piritual Travel, I wit|ne&s;&s;ed a Growth in Experience, and an Enlargement in Expre&s;&s;ions and heavenly Doctrine; and my Heart was mightily enlarged to run the Ways of God's Commandments, and divers were convinced, and &s;ome, I hope, thoroughly converted, and many comforted, and God, thro' the Mini&s;try of his dear Son, glorified, who is thereof only worthy for ever.</P>
<P>In all which I have nothing to boa&s;t of nor glory in, &s;aving in the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; for what is <HI>Paul,</HI> or <HI>Apollos,</HI> or <HI>Cephas,</HI> but In&s;truments? (I would not be under&s;tood to compare with tho&s;e Apo&s;tles, but to endeavour to follow them as they followed Chri&s;t.) Chri&s;t is All in all: He is the great Teach|er of Teachers, and the highe&s;t Schoolma&s;ter of all: And he &s;ays, <HI>He that will be my Di&s;ciple, mu&s;t fir&s;t deny him&s;elf, and take up his Cro&s;s, and follow me.</HI></P>
<P>We do not find any where in the New-Te&s;tament, that Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters or Me&s;&s;engers were only to &s;peak or preach to one Meeting of People, or that they were called or hired by Man; for then it would have been nece&s;&s;ary Man &s;hould pay them; but Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>Freely you have received, freely give; and go forth,</HI> &amp;c. Matth. xxviii. 19, 20.</P>
<P>And, my Friend, I find to this Day, that it is &s;afe for me when I am Mini&s;tring to the People; when the Spring of Divine Life and Power, (from which

<P>I would have this taken no otherwi&s;e, but as one Friend and Brother opening their States and Condi|tion to another for Edification, and the Strength'ning each other in Chri&s;t.

<P>The 25th of Twelfth Month I was at the Burial of the Wife of <HI>Randal Spikeman.</HI> It being our Fifth-Day-Meeting, divers &s;ober People were there not of our Per&s;ua&s;ion, and I was drawn forth to &s;peak to the People of the Death of Chri&s;t and his Merits, and to &s;hew them that there is no Merit in the Works of Man, as he is Man, or in a formal Righteou&s;ne&s;s or Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>In our Yearly Meeting at <HI>Burlington</HI> it was agreed that the Families of Friends &s;hould be vi&s;ited, and &s;oon after our Monthly-meeting appointed me, with other Friends, to vi&s;it the Families of Friends of our Meet|ing; in which Vi&s;itation, many were comforted and edify'd, both Youth and Aged; and we could truly &s;ay, that the Power and Grace of God, and the &s;weet Love of Chri&s;t accompanied us from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, to our mutual Comfort; and we were &s;o extraordina|rily opened and guided to &s;peak to the States of the People in their Families (that were unknown and Stran|gers to us) that &s;ometimes &s;ome of them were ready to think that we &s;poke by Information, when in Truth we were clear of any &s;uch Thing, and only &s;poke from what was immediately given to us, without any Infor|mation from Man or Woman; which to us was &s;ome|times very wonderful, and caus'd us to prai&s;e the great Name of the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="006297_0158_1028573888A30770">In the Fir&s;t Month, the General-Meeting at <HI>Phila|delphia,</HI> was a &s;olid, good Meeting, and ended in a Sen&s;e of Grace and Truth, which comes by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Next Day, being our Week-Day-Meeting, our dear Friends, <HI>Elizabeth Levis,</HI> and <HI>Jane Fenn,</HI> took Leave of us, they intending for the I&s;land of <HI>Barba|dos</HI>; and it was &s;uch a Parting-Meeting that will not &s;oon be forgotten by &s;ome of us then pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burling|ton.</NOTE>After this Meeting I went to <HI>Burlington,</HI> to vi&s;it one that was &s;ick, and under &s;ome Trouble of Mind for going a&s;tray, and greatly de&s;ired to come into the right Way, with whom I had a good, &s;ea&s;onable Meeting, to her Comfort, and my own Satisfaction. Upon this Vi&s;it I would remark, that it is a great Pity, that Youth, when in Health and Strength, &s;hould put off the Work of their Salvation, and forget the mo&s;t High, till either Sickne&s;s or Death overtake them. And then, Oh! the bitter piercing Cries and Groans, and terrible Agonies the Soul is in, which, by timely Repentance, and Amendment of Life, might be avoided.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1725.</NOTE>I was afterwards at Meetings at <HI>Philadelphia, Merion, Germantown,</HI> &amp;c. and had &s;ome Service and Satisfacti|on therein.&mdash;And on the 2d of Second Month, the Friend whom I vi&s;ited as above, was buried, and the Relations of the Decea&s;ed &s;ent for me to the Burial. The Per&s;on being well-beloved, there was a large Ap|pearance of People of divers Per&s;ua&s;ions, and we had an Opportunity at this Funeral to exhort the People to live &s;o as that they might die well; and that the Way to die in the Favour of God, was to live in his Fear; and Charity to tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from one another, was pre&s;&s;ingly recommended from the Apo&s;tle's Words, that <HI>If we had Faith to remove Mountains, and to give all our Goods to the Poor, and our Bodies to be burned, yet if we wanted Charity, we were but like &s;ounding Bra&s;s, and a tinkling Cymbal,</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. 1, 2, 3. And al&s;o our Belief of the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection of

the Dead was a&s;&s;erted, in Contradiction to that gro&s;s Calumny ca&s;t on our Society of denying it.</P>
<P>The latter End of the Second Month, I was at a Marriage at <HI>Hor&s;ham</HI> (at which was pre&s;ent <HI>William Keith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hor&s;ham.</NOTE> our Governor) and I was concerned to &s;peak of the End of that great Ordinance, and of the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e married Per&s;ons who fulfil the Covenants they make in Marriage, and what Strength and Comfort the Man is to the Woman, and the Woman to the Man, when they keep their Covenants, and that they are the contrary when they break them: And I al&s;o opened the Methods pre&s;cribed by our Di&s;cipline, to be ob&s;erv'd in Marriages, and our Care to prevent any clande&s;tine Marriages among&s;t us. After Meeting I return'd Home without going to the Marriage-Dinner, as I generally avoided &s;uch Entertainments as much as I could, having no Life in, or Liking to them, being &s;en&s;ible that great Companies and Preparations at Wed|dings, were growing Inconveniencies among us, the which I was con&s;cientiou&s;ly concerned to di&s;courage. And a few Days after my Return Home, at our Meet|ing at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> I was concerned particularly to exhort Friends to keep to Plainne&s;s in Language, Dre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to the Examples given us in the Holy Scrip|tures, particularly that of <HI>Daniel</HI> and his Companions; and to caution again&s;t vain and indecent Fa&s;hions, which, with Concern, I have ob&s;erv'd to prevail too much among &s;ome who make Profe&s;&s;ion with us.</P>
<P>In this Second Month I went to the Yearly-Meeting of Friends at <HI>Salem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salem.</NOTE> and by the Way had two Meet|ings at <HI>Woodberry-Creek.</HI> At <HI>Salem</HI> we had a large Meeting, and our gracious Lord was with us, to the bowing many Hearts before him, and many Te&s;timo|nies were given of the Goodne&s;s, Love, Mercy, and Grace of God, and his dear Son, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. From <HI>Salem</HI> we travelled to <HI>Alloways-Creek</HI> and <HI>Cohan|&s;ie,</HI> and from thence to <HI>El&s;inburgh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cohan&s;ie,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> and ferried over the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> with our Hor&s;es, to <HI>George</HI>'s-<HI>Creek,</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="006297_0160_1028573FF961E160">
and had Meetings at all tho&s;e Places. At <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Creek,</HI> one, not a Friend, came to me after Meeting, and &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">George's-Creek.</NOTE>
<Q>He thanked me for my Advice and Coun|&s;el;</Q>
and &s;eem'd heartily affected with the Doctrine of Chri&s;t. From <HI>George</HI>'s-<HI>Creek</HI> we travelled to <HI>Not|tingham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Notting|ham.</NOTE> and had a large Meeting on a Fir&s;t-Day, and another (very large) on the Second-Day, where were many People of divers Per&s;ua&s;ions. The Hou&s;e could not contain us, &s;o that we met in an Orchard. A &s;olid Meeting it was! wherein the mighty Power of the Creator was declar'd of, as al&s;o the Divinity of Chri&s;t, and his Manhood, and People were exhorted to be careful of forming any per&s;onal Ideas of the Al|mighty; for the Holy Scriptures do plainly manife&s;t, that God is a wonderful, infinite, eternal Spirit, and therefore is to be wor&s;hipped in Spirit and in Truth, and outward Repre&s;entations of the Lord Jehovah, bor|ders too much on Idolatry. Pretty much was delive|ed on that Head; and I was told after Meeting that divers <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> were there, tho' I knew nothing of it. From <HI>Nottingham</HI> I went to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Newca|&s;tle.</NOTE> had a Meeting there, and then vi&s;ited a &s;ick Friend, with which he expre&s;&s;ed much Satisfaction; and then went on to the <HI>Center,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Center, Kennet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Kennet,</HI> and <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and &s;o to the Month|ly-Meeting at <HI>New-Garden,</HI> where we had a large, open Meeting, wherein was &s;hewn, that tho&s;e who meddled with our Di&s;cipline, in the Will, Nature, Spirit, and Wi&s;dom of Man only, could do but little Service, and that our Di&s;cipline, as al&s;o our Wor&s;hip and Mini|&s;try, ought to be performed in the Wi&s;dom and Pow|er of God, thro' the Grace and Spirit of Chri&s;t.&mdash; From <HI>New-Garden</HI> we went to <HI>Birmingham,</HI> had a large Meeting, and I was much drawn forth to the Youth, of whom many were there: From <HI>Birmingham</HI> we went to the Quarterly-meeting for Di&s;cipline and Wor&s;hip at <HI>Concord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concord.</NOTE> in <HI>Che&s;ter-County,</HI> which was larger than I had ever &s;een there before. In the Quarterly-meeting of Di&s;cipline, Friends were exhorted to keep to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and to &s;peak to Matters in the Fear

of God, and to avoid and &s;hun as much as in them lay, Self-Will, Humour, Pride, and Pa&s;&s;ion; &s;hewing that the rough, crooked, unhewn, unpoli&s;h'd Nature of Man, could never work the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and is contrary to the meek, Self-denying, Life of Je&s;us. <HI>John Salkeld,</HI> and <HI>Jacob Howell,</HI> then &s;ignifying that they were going to vi&s;it Friends in <HI>Long-I&s;land</HI> and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> the Sen&s;e of the Call, Labour, and Work of the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel, and of the Love of Chri&s;t (in the Freene&s;s of it) to Mankind, took &s;ome good Hold on divers in that Meeting, and the great Name of God, and his dear Son, thro' the Holy Spirit, was glorified.</P>
<P>From this Meeting I came Home (having been out on this Journey near three Weeks, at 20 Meetings, and travelled more than 200 Miles) and found my Wife and Children in Health, and we rejoiced to &s;ee each other; but my Rejoicing was in Fear, even almo&s;t to Trembling, le&s;t I &s;hould be too much lifted up when Things were agreeable to me.</P>
<P>After my Return Home I went to &s;everal neigh|bouring Meetings, and on a Fifth-Day was at <HI>Phila|delphia,</HI> at the Marriage of <HI>Richard Smith</HI> and <HI>Eliza|beth Powell.</HI> The Meeting was large, and the Marriage &s;olemnly celebrated, and the People were earne&s;tly in|treated to love Chri&s;t above all, and to manife&s;t that Love by keeping his Commandments, and that not in Shew or Words only, but in the Heart and Affec|tions.</P>
<P>About the latter End of the Third Month, I went to the Quarterly-meeting of Mini&s;ters and Elders for the County of <HI>Burlington</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burling|ton. Stony-Brook.</NOTE> and from thence to <HI>Stony-Brook</HI>; where, on the Fir&s;t-day, we had a large Meeting (in <HI>Jo&s;eph Worth</HI>'s Barn) which was crowded with People, and was a &s;olid, good Meeting. From <HI>Stony-Brook</HI> I went to <HI>Cro&s;wicks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro&s;wicks</NOTE> and was at their Youth's Meeting, which was the large&s;t I had ever &s;een in that Place; I told them they might

&s;ay as the Sons of the Prophets did, <HI>That the Place was too &s;treight for them,</HI> and advi&s;ed them to enlarge it. I was glad to &s;ee &s;uch a large Appearance of &s;ober People, and &s;o great an Increa&s;e of Youth (in this Wil|derne&s;s of <HI>America</HI>) and exhorted them to live in the Fear of God, that his Ble&s;&s;ings might &s;till be continued to them; and an Exerci&s;e was on my Mind for the Welfare of the young People, to &s;hew them the Dan|ger of Sin and Vanity, and of keeping ill Company, and following bad Coun&s;el; and that the young King <HI>Rehoboam</HI> (<HI>Solomon</HI>'s Son) lo&s;t the greate&s;t Part of his Fa|ther's Kingdom, by following the Company and Coun&s;el of vain, young Men; and that many young Men in this Age had lo&s;t and &s;pent the E&s;tates their Fathers had left them by the like Conduct, and brought them&s;elves to Ruin, and their Families to Poverty and Want. Di|vers lively Te&s;timonies were delivered in this Meeting, and it ended with Adoration and Prai&s;e of Almighty God; and tho' the Meeting held more than four Hours, the People did not &s;eem willing to go away when it was over; for indeed it was a &s;olid, good Meet|ing. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Quarterly-meeting was car|ried on in Peace and Love (that being the Mark the Di&s;ciples of Je&s;us were to be known by) and Friends were exhorted with a great deal of Tenderne&s;s to keep that Mark.</P>
<P>In this Journey I travelled about ninety Miles, and was at four Meetings, being from Home four Days, and was much &s;atisfied in my Journey; but met with &s;ome Exerci&s;e when I came Home, hearing of &s;ome Lo&s;&s;es and Damage to my E&s;tate; &s;o that I found <HI>after I had</HI> (according to my be&s;t Endeavours) <HI>done the Will of God, I had need of Patience, that I might receive the Promi&s;e.</HI> I was &s;en&s;ible of the Me&s;&s;enger of Satan, the Thorn in the Fle&s;h, which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of.</P>
<P>About this Time a loving Friend of mine informed me, that one whom I very well knew in <HI>Barbados,</HI> a Mini&s;ter of our Society, had gone into an open Sepa|ration,

&s;o as to keep Meetings &s;eparate from his Bre|thren, and contrary to their Advice: I was concerned in Love to write a few Lines to him, to remind him of the unhappy State and End of &s;uch, who, notwith|&s;tanding the brotherly Love and kind Treatment of Friends, had &s;eparated from us, and lo&s;ing the Sen&s;e of Truth, which had made them &s;erviceable in the Church, were acted by a rending, dividing Spirit, by which the Enemy of our Happine&s;s had &s;o far obtain'd his End, as to make &s;ome Di&s;turbance for a Time; but few, if any, of the&s;e Separati&s;ts, have had further Power than to promote and maintain their &s;eparate Meetings during their own Lives; &s;uch Meetings hav|ing, in every In&s;tance I have known (except one, and that la&s;ted not long) dropt on the Death of the Foun|ders. And tho' we think it our Duty to te&s;tify again&s;t, and di&s;own all &s;uch; yet this Di&s;owning is only until the Per&s;ons offending, from a real Sen&s;e of, and Sor|rows for their Faults, acknowledge and condemn the &s;ame; then the Arms of Chri&s;t, and of his Church, are open to receive and embrace them: I therefore ear|ne&s;tly be&s;ought him to con&s;ider the Danger of offend|ing any who love and believe in Chri&s;t (tho' never &s;o little in their own or other Mens E&s;teem) for we can|not have true Peace in departing from the pure Love of God, his Truth, and People; to which I added the following Sentences out of the New-Te&s;tament:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By this &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one to another,</HI> John xiii. 35.&mdash;Don't lo&s;e this Mark.</P>

<P>THINE from <HI>Burlington</HI> of the 26<HI>th,</HI> 5<HI>th Mon.</HI> I received, by which I perceive the Hand of the Almighty hath been upon thee for thy Vanity and Folly; and I de&s;ire that thou may be very careful to keep clo&s;e to that Hand, and do not go from under it, but mind the Light of Chri&s;t that hath di&s;covered God to be great and good, and his dear Son to be thy Saviour, and Sin and Satan to be Evil, which Evil (if thou follows it) will certainly bring thee to De|&s;truction and eternal Woe; but if thou follows Chri&s;t, and walks according to that Light by which he hath manife&s;ted Sin to be exceeding &s;inful, in his Time; as thou waits in Patience, he will bring thee through his righteous Judgments unto Victory.</P>

<P>The young Man took this Coun&s;el well, and kept to Meetings, and behaved &s;oberly for a Time, but afterwards ran out, kept bad Company, took to Drinking to Exce&s;s, ran him&s;elf in Debt, and at length into a Goal, which hath been the unhappy Ca&s;e of many un&s;table Youths, who, <HI>when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their Imaginations, and their fooli&s;h Hearts be|came darkened.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bybury.</NOTE>In this Month I was at <HI>Bybury</HI> and <HI>Abington</HI> Meet|ings, in which we were favour'd with the immediate Power and Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, to our great Comfort and Edification, the Vi&s;itation of divine Love to the Youth having a good Effect on &s;ome of them, and the latter Meeting ended with Prai&s;e to the Almighty, after Supplications for all Men, from our King on the Throne, to the meane&s;t of his Subjects.</P>
<P>In my Travels I met with a Per&s;on who query'd of me, how he &s;hould know which Society had mo&s;t of the Holy Spirit, &s;ince mo&s;t of the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t do believe in the Holy Gho&s;t (or Spirit?)</P>
<P>To whom I made the following An&s;wer, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Let the Rule of Chri&s;t determine this Que&s;tion; he &s;ays, <HI>By their Fruits ye &s;hall know them; Do Men ga|ther Grapes of Thorns, or Figgs of Thi&s;tles? Matt.</HI> vii. 16. The Fruits then of the Spirit of Chri&s;t are, Love,
<PB N="157" REF="006297_0169_1028575BAD1899F8">
Faith, Hope, Patience, Humility, Temperance, God|line&s;s, brotherly Kindne&s;s and Charity, with all Manner of Virtues. Therefore the Society of Chri&s;tians, who brings forth mo&s;t of the Fruits of the Holy Spirit, con|&s;equently have mo&s;t of Chri&s;t's Grace and Spirit. But &s;ome object and &s;ay, we will not believe that any Society have the Holy Gho&s;t now, or the immediate Revela|tion or In&s;piration of the Spirit, unle&s;s they work Mira|cles. To which it is an&s;wered, That right Reforma|tion from Sin, and true Faith in Chri&s;t, cannot be wrought without a Miracle, neither can we bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit without the miraculous Power of Chri&s;t.&mdash;Men by Nature bring forth the Works of Na|ture, and that which is contrary to Nature is miraculous. Sin is natural, but divine Holine&s;s, or the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, wrought in Man, is &s;piritual, &s;upernatural, and miraculous. And as to natural Men (that are in a &s;tate of Nature) &s;eeing outward Miracles, if they will not, nor do not believe what is written in the holy Scriptures of the Old and New-Te&s;tament, neither will they believe, altho' one were to ri&s;e from the Dead. Notwith&s;tanding Chri&s;t wrought outward Miracles, and did the Works which none other could do; tho' he cured all Manner of Di&s;ea&s;es, and fed many Thou&s;ands with a few Loaves, and a few &s;mall Fi&s;hes (and what re|mained, when all had eaten, was more than there was at fir&s;t) tho' he rai&s;ed the Dead, and him&s;elf aro&s;e from the Dead, yet few, but very few, believed in him, &s;o as truly to follow him. His Birth, his Life, his Doc|trines, his Death, his Re&s;urrection, are all miraculous; and &s;ince all this was done in the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, and at the fir&s;t Publication of his Religion to Men, there is now no ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of outward Miracles, tho' his Power is the &s;ame now as ever; but he &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>He that believeth on me, the Work that I do, &s;hall he do al&s;o, and greater Works than the&s;e &s;hall he do,</HI> John xiv. 12. Upon which <HI>W. Dell</HI> &s;ays, <HI>This mu&s;t be under&s;tood in Relation to Sin; for Chri&s;t had no Sin in

him&s;elf to overcome, but we all have &s;inned,</HI> and to over|come Sin is the greate&s;t of Miracles.&mdash;This will try the notional or nominal Chri&s;tian, who &s;ays, we can never overcome Sin in this World.&mdash;Where then is our Faith in the Son of God, who for this Purpo&s;e was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the Works of the Devil, <HI>John</HI> iii. 8. <HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 14.</P>
<P>Therefore let not Chri&s;tians be &s;low of Heart to be|lieve in the glorious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and if we truly believe therein, and live in the Practice of his Doctrine, we &s;hall &s;ee Miracles enough to &s;atisfy us forever.</P>
<P>The 16th of Sixth Month, I was at the Weekly-meet|ing at <HI>Franckfort,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Franck|fort.</NOTE> which, tho' a &s;mall Meeting, was &s;weet, reviving, and comfortable, to &s;ome of us; &s;o that we had a &s;ufficient Reward for leaving our Bu&s;ine&s;s (at be|ing the Time of our Hay Harve&s;t)&mdash;Week-day-meet|ings are much neglected by many, more is the Pity.&mdash; The Apo&s;tle's Advice is nece&s;&s;ary for many in our Age, even of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, <HI>viz.

<P>The 23d of Sixth Month, my Cart-wheel, being Iron bound, ran over me, and my Hor&s;e kick'd me on the Head; the Wheel put my Shoulder out, and the Hor&s;e wounded my Head &s;o that the Scull was bare, and my Legg was &s;orely brui&s;ed; the &s;ame Day Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Graham,</HI> with the Help of two of our Neighbours, &s;et my Shoulder, and dre&s;&s;ed my Wounds; and the Lord was &s;o merciful to me, that the next Day I was enabled to write this Memorandum of this wonderful Deliverance and &s;peedy Cure, for which, added to the many I have received from his gracious Hand, I have Occa&s;ion to be truly thankful: I was obliged to keep at home &s;ome Time, and thought it long, becau&s;e I could not go to Meetings as u&s;ual; but many Friends came to &s;ee me, which was a Comfort to me. One Day upwards of thirty Per&s;ons came from

&s;everal Parts of the Country to &s;ee how I did, and were glad I was like to recover. The Day before I was &s;o hurt (being the fir&s;t of the Week) I was at Meeting at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and was concern'd to &s;peak of the Uncertainty of Life, and the many Accidents we are incident to in tho&s;e frail Bodies, and exhorted Friends to live &s;o, that they might have a Con&s;cience &s;erene, and clear of Offence towards God and Man, and then they might expect the Comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t, which in &s;uch Sea&s;on of Difficulty would be a great Help and Benefit to them, of which I had the &s;weet Experience the next Day, under great Extremity of Pain; and tho' the Pain of my Body was &s;uch that I could not for &s;everal Nights take my natural Re&s;t, yet I had Comfort, thro' the &s;weet Influence of the Holy Spirit, which Chri&s;t promi&s;ed his Followers, <HI>John</HI> xiv. 26.</P>
<P>On the 18th of the Seventh Month began our Yearly-meeting at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which was large, and our Friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.</NOTE> <HI>John Wanton,</HI> and <HI>William Anthony,</HI> from <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>Abigail Bowles,</HI> from <HI>Ireland,</HI> had good Service therein.

<P>The Beginning of the Eighth Month, being a little recovered from my Hurt, I had a De&s;ire once more to &s;ee my Friends on the Ea&s;tern Shore of <HI>Maryland,</HI> at their General-meeting at <HI>Choptank.</HI> The fir&s;t Day I &s;et out, I travelled about thirty Miles, and at Night was very weary, being but weak in Body, and I was almo&s;t ready to faint in my Mind about proceeding any further; but next Day <HI>George Robin&s;on</HI> (at who&s;e Hou&s;e I lodged) offering to accompany me, we tra|velled about forty Miles to <HI>Sa&s;&s;afras</HI> River, and both of us, tho' much tired, were comforted in each other's Company and Conver&s;ation. On the next Day we travelled near twenty Miles to the General-meeting in

<HI>Caecil</HI> County, in <HI>Maryland</HI>; where we met with two Friends from <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary|land.</NOTE> and two from <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia,</HI> who were there on the like Occa&s;ion. The Meeting was large and quiet, many People being there not of our Society, and were very &s;ober: The Meeting held &s;everal Days, wherein the Go&s;pel-Di&s;|pen&s;ation was &s;et forth, and the Love of God in Chri&s;t was exalted. From <HI>Caecil</HI> we went to <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> River, and had a Meeting there, at which the People were exhorted to come to Chri&s;t, the eternal Rock, and true Foundation, and to build their Religion on him, again&s;t whom the Gates of Hell can never prevail; and they were &s;o much affected, that they did not &s;eem forward to leave the Hou&s;e after the Meeting was over.

of the many favourable Sea&s;ons of God's Love we had enjoy'd in our Travels in the Work of the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and we tenderly pray|ed, if we never met more in this World, we might meet in that which is to come, where we might never part more, but might forever live to &s;ing with all the Saints and holy Angels, Hallelujah to God and the Lamb. From <HI>Darby</HI> I went to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> Third-day Meeting, and from thence to my Hou&s;e, where my dear Wife and Children with open Hearts and Arms received me, and I them with Joy; at which Time I had a gracious Reward of Peace for my Labour of Love, which far exceeded Silver or Gold.

Tho' at the &s;ame Time, according to the Doctrine of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, I was for Temperance in Meats and Drinks, as well as Moderation in Apparel. The next Day we had a very large Meeting at <HI>Oy&s;ter-Bay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oy&s;ter-Bay.</NOTE> many being there, who were not of our Society, who &s;teadily gave Attention to what was declared: Here being many young People, they were per&s;uaded to give up their blooming Years to do the Will of God, and to Remember him their Creator, in their youthful Days: Friends &s;aid there had not been &s;uch a Meeting there a great while, for which Opportunity I was humbly thankful to the Lord. After Meeting we went to <HI>Samuel Underhill</HI>'s, and had an Evening-meeting with his Brother, who, through Sickne&s;s and Lamene&s;s, could not get out for a long Time. "Next" Day, <HI>Samuel Bowne,</HI> being with me, we went to vi&s;it a young Wo|man that was weak in Body, but lay in a comfortable Frame of Mind; &s;he was thankful for our Vi&s;it, and &s;aid the Vi&s;its of her Friends were comfortable to her.

The next Fir&s;t-day we had a large Meeting at <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> wherein many weighty Truths were opened to the Satisfaction and Edification of the Auditory, and in the Evening we had a Meeting with the Wife of <HI>Mat|thew Farrington,</HI> who was too weakly to go abroad; the Neighbours came in, and we had a &s;ea&s;onable Oppor|tunity. The next Third-day was the Youths-meeting at <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> in which we were concerned to exhort to Obe|dience to God and their Parents, and to follow their Pa|rents as they follow Chri&s;t; for where any leave Chri&s;t, there we are to leave their Example, though they were our Fathers or Mothers; and the right Honour|ing of our Parents was &s;et forth, and they exhorted not to de&s;pi&s;e the Day of &s;mall Things, and the happy State of the Obedient, and the unhappy State of the Di&s;obedient, and many weighty Truths were delive|red to them in that Meeting by &s;everal experienced Friends.

<P>BELIEVING it might be acceptable to you to hear that I was got well to my Habitation in &s;uch a difficult Time of the Year as I &s;et out from you in;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Epi|&s;tle to Friends in <HI>Long-I&s;land.</HI></NOTE> and al&s;o feeling the &s;weet Influence of the divine Love of the heavenly Father, and his dear Son our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to ari&s;e and &s;pring in my Heart, and flowing towards you:</P>
<P>It came into my Mind to write a few Lines to the Quarterly-meeting of Friends at <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> by way of Epi&s;tle, well knowing al&s;o that many of us are as Epi&s;tles writ in one anothers Hearts by the heaven|ly Finger of the mo&s;t High; and tho&s;e Characters of divine Love &s;o written will not ea&s;ily be era&s;ed. I could willingly have been at your Quarterly-meeting, but that I had been &s;o long from my Family, that I was much wanted therein, and my coming Home was &s;ea&s;onable and acceptable, both to them and my Friends; and I humbly thank the Lord, I found all well. Now that which is on my Mind to your Quarterly-meeting, is after this Manner, concerning the Government of the Church of Chri&s;t, of which Church He is the holy Head and Lawgiver: Where|fore we are to &s;eek and wait for Coun&s;el and Wi&s;|dom from him, in all our Monthly and Quarterly-meetings, for the well-ordering of our little Society, which is growing and increa&s;ing in the Earth, and al&s;o in your I&s;land (notwith&s;tanding the invidious Attempts of &s;ome Men of corrupt Minds) and it will grow and increa&s;e more and more, as we keep our Places, our heavenly Places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Dear Friends, the good Order of Truth, and Go|vernment of Chri&s;t in his Church, is a great Help to us and our Children, when carried on in Chri&s;t's

Spirit [pray ob&s;erve or mind that] for if our Order, and Church-Government, be carried on in the Spirit of Man (as he is meer Man) tho' he is never &s;o crafty, or cunning, it will do more Hurt than Good in the Church of Chri&s;t. Chri&s;t's Spirit mu&s;t go|vern Chri&s;t's Church; and when, and where, that is over all, then, and there, Chri&s;t's Church, and Kingdom, is exalted, of who&s;e Kingdom and Peace there will be no End; and happy will all tho&s;e be, who&s;e End is in it. <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that Man of God, governed in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church in the Spirit of God, and when he found the Work too heavy for him, the Lord put his Spirit on Seventy more, who were Help-meets in the Government; &s;o that it was God's Spirit that governed; and while that ru|led them, all was well; but when they went from that, they fell into Error and Di&s;obedience; and, at length, the Me&s;&s;iah came, and he governed his own little Flock him&s;elf; and when he a&s;cended up on high, he promi&s;ed his Spirit &s;hould be with, and in his Church, forever, and be their holy Guide into all Truth, in which he would al&s;o comfort them: And Chri&s;t fulfilled this his Promi&s;e; for when his Di&s;ciples waited at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to be endued with Power from on high, according to the Advice of their Lord, they were filled with the Gift and Grace of the Holy Spirit: And when the Brethren and El|ders met together about the Affairs and Govern|ment of the Church, they gave forth Rules and Or|ders from that General-meeting to the particular Ones; and the Holy Gho&s;t pre&s;ided among&s;t them, which they &s;ignified to the other Meetings, &s;aying, <HI>It &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to us, to put you in Mind of &s;uch and &s;uch Things.</HI> And while this Holy Gho&s;t, or Spirit, governed in the primi|tive Chri&s;tian Church, all was well; God and Chri&s;t was glorified, and his Church and People edified; but by going from that, the Apo&s;tacy came in.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="006297_0187_102857938E2D4D90">Wherefore, dear Friends, keep clo&s;e to the Spirit, Power, Light, and Divine Life, of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in your Monthly and Quarterly Meetings for the Go|vernment of the Church, as well as in your Meetings for the Wor&s;hip of the Almighty; for if we go from that, he will go from us.</P>
<P>And, dear Friends, the Te&s;timony of Je&s;us, in the Spirit of Prophecy, opens in me after this Man|ner, that if our Society keep and live up to the Spirit and Truth of Chri&s;t, which hath been mani|fe&s;ted to our Fore-fathers, and to us al&s;o in this Age, the great Lord of all will pro&s;per his Work in our Hands, and ble&s;s both us and our Children, as we and they keep therein.</P>
<P>And as we have kept clo&s;e to this our heavenly Guide, how hath the Lord &s;weetly manife&s;ted his Love and Power to us in our Meetings for the well-ordering of our Society? Which many Times hath filled our Hearts with pure Prai&s;es, and holy Thank&s;giving, to the high and lofty One, who in|habits Eternity, and dwells in the highe&s;t Heavens, and is Light forever: To whom, with the Lamb of God, who takes away the Sins of the World, I recommend you, my dear and well beloved Friends, Brethren, and Si&s;ters, in Chri&s;t, with my own Soul.</P>

Fifth-day being the Week-day Meeting at <HI>Burlington,</HI> Friends of the Town de&s;ired I would &s;tay at it; I thought we had ju&s;t before had divers good Opportunities, and my own Inclinations &s;eemed to lead to my Family; but Friends being de&s;irous of my &s;taying, I did &s;o, and we had a good, &s;olid Meeting. After Meeting a &s;olid good Friend &s;aid, "He thought we had the be&s;t Wine at la&s;t;" and indeed the Love of God through Chri&s;t, is &s;o &s;weet to his People, that the la&s;t often &s;eems the be&s;t, when it is only a renewed Vi&s;itation of the &s;ame Love to his Children.

<P>On the 6th Day of the Fir&s;t Month (being the Fir&s;t of the Week) I was at the Morning and Afternoon Meetings in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> wherein tho&s;e who call them|&s;elves <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> were exhorted, to be careful of drinking too freely, le&s;t they might ju&s;tly be called Free-drinkers; for many times &s;uch, when they drink too freely of &s;trong Liquor, think and &s;peak too freely their own corrupt Notions, to the Di&s;honour of God, and to the Scandal of Religion in general.</P>

I may farther add, that when Fa|ther was about 60 Years of Age, he had a Concern to vi&s;it Friends Meetings in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ome other Parts of the Nation; and in the 75th Year of his Age, he travelled to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and from thence (in Company with <HI>James Bates,</HI> a publick Friend, of <HI>Virginia</HI>) went over for <HI>Ireland</HI>; in all which Services he had good Satisfaction, and was

well received of Friends: Divers other Journeys and Travels he performed not here noted; but this Jour|ney into mother Nation at 75 Years of Age, &s;hews his Age had not quenched his Love and Zeal for his Lord's Work and Service.</P>
<P>In our Father's Old-age he was attended with very great Exerci&s;es: About the 77th Year of his Age, as he was a&s;&s;i&s;ting his Men in the Du&s;k of the Evening, he mi&s;&s;ed his Footing, and fell down, and broke his Leg; and &s;oon after his Leg was well, he met with another Accident by a Fall, which di&s;|abled him, and made him lame to his Death, never recovering the Hurt he had by that Fall, which was after this Manner; he was &s;itting in a Chair by his Door on a Plank, which not being &s;et fa&s;t, it fell, and he, to &s;ave him&s;elf from the Stroke of the Plank, fell with his Hip on the Stones, and got hurt ex|ceedingly, notwith&s;tanding he was remarkable for his Activity; he would walk (tho' &s;o aged, and al&s;o lame) as far as the <HI>Work-hou&s;e, Devon&s;hire-hou&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Mouth</HI> Meetings [two or three Miles from Home.] The la&s;t bad Accident that befel him was about three Weeks before his Death, when, being walking in the Timber-yard, a &s;ingle Plank, which &s;tood again&s;t a Pile, fell down, and &s;triking him on the Side, threw him down; he complained not much of the Blow till about a Week after, when he was taken with a violent Pain in his Side, on the very Place where he received the Stroke, and, when his Cough took him (with which he was often troubled) the Pain was very great; howbeit, thro' Means of a Sear-cloth he received &s;ome Ea&s;e, and the Pain of his Side abated, and the Cough went off; but a violent Flux followed, and it brought him very low, and extream weak; &s;o that it was thought he could not continue long; upon which Notice was &s;ent to me, and I went to &s;ee him, and found him very low; but he revived, and changed often in this la&s;t Illne&s;s;

I having been to &s;ee him five or &s;ix Days before, having an Account he was ill, I then found him chearful, and thought he might recover.

<P>After a little Time of Silence, he de&s;ired me to remember his dear Love, in the Life of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to my dear Brother, <HI>Thomas Chalkley,</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia,</HI> and to all my old Friends and Acquaintance.</P>
<P>About the 11th Hour in the Morning he enquired how the Tide was, which no Body pre&s;ent could exactly tell; &s;ome Time after he a&s;ked again; his Man then went out to &s;ee, returning, he told him, it would be High-water about 3 a Clock in the Af|ternoon; he then lay &s;till a while, and after &s;ome Pau&s;e &s;poke chearfully out aloud, &s;o that all in the Room might hear him, <HI>I &s;hall go off about Five</HI>; his Man &s;aid, Ma&s;ter, how do'&s;t know?

<P>I have a great Deal in my Heart, more than I can write concerning my dear Father's Life, it hav|ing been a wonderful Life to me from my Youth up; his early Care of me, and Coun&s;el to me, when I was too thoughtle&s;s and wild, melts me in|to Tears now in the Remembrance of it; and my tender Mother was a Partner with him in the &s;ame Exerci&s;e, and &s;he died in like Peace: The la&s;t Words I heard her &s;peak, were, <HI>I long to be di&s;&s;olved.</HI> And as to my tender Father, I would record a little briefly in Memory of him, that he was,</P>

<P>3d, He had a fatherly Care for his Children, in tender Prayers for us, and in good Advice to us, and in giving us Learning according to his Ability, and teaching us (by his Example, as well as Precept) Indu&s;try, Humility, and the true Religion of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, endeavouring to plant it in us be|times, and to de&s;troy the evil Root of Sin in us, while young.</P>

<P>5th, He was univer&s;ally beloved by his Neigh|bours, and I do not remember any Difference be|tween him and them, in the many Years I lived with him; but all was Peace and Love.</P>

<P>Our General-meeting at <HI>Franckfort,</HI> the 30th of Fourth-month, was large, our Friend <HI>William Piggot,</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> being there (in the Cour&s;e of his Vi&s;it to Friends in <HI>America</HI>) and had clo&s;e Work and good Service in this Meeting.</P>
<P>In the Fifth Month, 1726, I vi&s;ited the Meetings of Friends at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia, German|town, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Germantown,</HI> and <HI>Bybury,</HI> in &s;ome of which Meetings, as al&s;o at our own at <HI>Franckfort,</HI> I had very comfortable Satisfaction: My Te&s;timony was pretty &s;harp &s;ometimes to Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors, and therefore &s;ome of them hate me, as the <HI>Jews</HI>

did my great Ma&s;ter: Becau&s;e I was concerned to te&s;tify, that their Deeds were Evil, and to excite my Friends to manife&s;t a Chri&s;tian Zeal, by openly denying ungodly Men, while they continue in their ungodly Works; but when they become truly penitent, and reform their Lives, the Arms of Chri&s;t, and his Church, will be open to receive them.</P>
<P>Being under &s;ome melancholy Thoughts, becau&s;e &s;ome Per&s;ons, for whom I wi&s;hed well, and to whom I had been of Service, were &s;o envious and malicious as to tell fal&s;e Stories of me, tending to defame me; as I was riding to our Meeting, it opened with Satisfaction to my Mind, <HI>The more my Enemies hate me, The more I'll love, if that can be</HI>; and I had hearty De&s;ires to come up in the Practice of this Re&s;olution: And I then thought I &s;hould come up with them all, for if a Man loves and prays for his Enemies, if they are gain|ed, he is in&s;trumental to their Good, and &s;o hath Cau&s;e of Rejoicing; and if they are not gained, he heaps Coals of Fire on their Heads; &s;o that every true Chri&s;tian, by keeping under the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and in the Practice of his Doctrine, gets the better of his Enemies.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Sixth Month, I was at the Burial of <HI>Robert Fletcher,</HI> a worthy Man, and one uni|ver&s;ally beloved by all Sorts of People (as far as ever I heard) There was a large Meeting at his Funeral, wherein &s;everal Te&s;timonies, &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion, were born: Some of his la&s;t Words were mentioned, which were, <HI>That he had lived according to the Mea&s;ure of Grace given him.</HI> And the Doctrine of the Re&s;ur|rection was maintained according to the Scripture, and the People were exhorted to prepare for their final Change. The Death of this Friend was a Lo&s;s to the Country, to our Society, and to his Neighbours, as well as to his Family and Friends.</P>
<P>After Meeting I travelled towards <HI>Uwchland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Uwch|land.</NOTE> had a Meeting there on Fir&s;t-day, and on Second-day ano|ther

<P>My Neighbour, <HI>Daniel Worthington,</HI> accompanied me in this rough Travel, &s;ome Part of the Way being hilly, and very &s;tony and bu&s;hy, and the Weather wet. We had four Meetings, and rode about four-&s;core Miles; and tho' I had travelled much in this Province, I had never been at &s;ome of tho&s;e Places be|fore: But a few Nights before I &s;et out, I had a plain Pro&s;pect of them in a Dream, or Night Vi&s;ion, as I &s;aw them afterwards, which I thought &s;ome-what remarkable.</P>
<P>The People inhabiting this Province, are now be|come numerous, and make many Settlements in the Woods, more than I have ob&s;erv'd in my Travels in any of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations; and there hath long been a De&s;ire in my Mind that they might pro&s;per in the Work of true and thorough Reformation; and a godly Fear and Concern being upon me, I have &s;ome|times put them in Mind of the State of this Land, when their Fathers fir&s;t came and &s;ettled in it; and to caution them, of growing carele&s;s, and forgetting the Lord, le&s;t he &s;hould for&s;ake them, and <HI>turn their</HI> now <HI>fruitful Fields into a barren Wilderne&s;s,</HI> as this was &s;o lately; which it is ea&s;y with him to do, if he plea&s;es, for the Sins of the People.</P>
<P>After my Return Home, I vi&s;ited many Meetings, as,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abington.

I lodged the Night before at <HI>Peter Fearon</HI>'s, and in the Morn|ing I was awaked out of my Sleep, as it were by a Voice, expre&s;&s;ing the&s;e Words; HE THAT LIVETH AND BELIEVETH IN ME SHALL NEVER DIE. This I took to be the Voice of Chri&s;t, I do not know that it was vocal, but it was as plain as one. From the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions I had to ob&s;erve to the People, the happy State and Priviledge of tho&s;e who live and believe in Chri&s;t, and that &s;uch mu&s;t not live in Sin.</P>
<P>During the Time of our Yearly-meeting, &s;ome rude People came up the River in a &s;mall Sloop, provided by them for that Purpo&s;e, and &s;pent their Time in drinking, carow&s;ing, and firing of Guns, to the Grief and Concern of Friends, who were religiou&s;ly di&s;charg|ing their Duty, in &s;erving and wor&s;hipping the Al|mighty; and, it is ob&s;ervable, that one of the&s;e di&s;or|derly Per&s;ons had his Hand &s;hot off at that Time, and that the chief Promoters and Actors in this riotous Company, were &s;oon after cut off by Death, in the Prime of their Days.</P>
<P>After the General-meeting was over, which ended well, Friends in the Love of God departed in Peace

I was at the Bank-meet|ing in the Afternoon, where we had a comfortable Time: And the next Sixth-day of the Week I was at our Month|ly-meeting, where it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, in Con|&s;ideration of &s;ome late indecent Conduct of &s;ome Per|&s;ons pretending to be of our Profe&s;&s;ion, that a Te&s;ti|mony from that Meeting &s;hould go forth again&s;t &s;uch di&s;orderly Doings, and unchri&s;tian Practices; and that all &s;uch Per&s;ons, who were irregular in their Conver|&s;ations, be di&s;own'd to be of our Community, until they by Repentance, manife&s;t their Reformation; which was accordingly &s;oon after publi&s;hed, and read in our Fir&s;t-day Morning Meeting, and in our Youths-meeting. And about this Time our Governor i&s;&s;ued a &s;ea&s;onable Proclamation again&s;t Drinking to Exce&s;s, Gaming, Swearing prophanely, Revelling, Night-walk|ing, and Di&s;turbing the Peace, and other Immoralities; which afforded &s;ome Satisfaction to &s;ober and well-in|clined Friends, and others: Yet there remain'd a great Exerci&s;e and Concern upon my Mind, that &s;ome young People, who&s;e Parents had been careful in training them up, were grown &s;o wicked, that by their extravagant Conduct, they not only di&s;turb'd our reli|gious Meetings, but likewi&s;e became obnoxious to the peaceable Government we live under.</P>
<P>In the Ninth Month I was at divers Meetings, at <HI>Merion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Merion.

much &s;hed abroad in our Hearts at that Meeting&punc; When it was over, and I had fini&s;hed my Bu&s;ine&s;s, I could not be clear in my Mind, without having &s;ome Meetings in the &s;aid Counties of <HI>Salem</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>; and tho' it was a &s;ickly Time, and People died pretty much in tho&s;e Parts where we were going, <HI>James Lord</HI> and I, in the Love of Chri&s;t, vi&s;ited the Meetings at <HI>Alloway</HI>'s Creek, <HI>Cohan&s;y, Pile</HI>'s-<HI>Grove, Woodberry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cohan&s;y,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Newton,</HI> and <HI>Haddonfield,</HI> having Meetings every Day in the Week, except the la&s;t, and &s;ometimes riding near twenty Miles after Meeting, the Days being at the &s;horte&s;t, and the Weather very cold; but the Lord was with us, which made &s;ufficient Amends for all the bodily Hard&s;hips we met with.</P>
<P>I got home well, but weary; and was well and joy|fully received by my loving Spou&s;e, Children, and Servants; and I was truly thankful to the Mo&s;t High, for his Pre&s;ence and Goodne&s;s continued to me; &s;o that, tho' I perceived my bodily Strength to decline a|pace, my Sight, Hearing, and Voice, failing much, I have Occa&s;ion to believe, at times I was helped even beyond Nature in the Work of Chri&s;t, my dear Lord and Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The 27th of the Tenth Month, I heard the News of the Death of my dear Friend <HI>John Lee</HI> (by one &s;ent to De&s;ire my Company at his Burial) It affected me with Sorrow, he being an old Acquaintance, and inward Friend of mine, with whom I had travelled many Miles: He was a living, &s;erviceable Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and in&s;trumental to convince di|vers of that Principle of Divine Light and Truth, which we profe&s;s. I could not be at his Burial, be|cau&s;e of my Indi&s;po&s;ition, and the Un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the Weather; yet I think it my Duty, to &s;ay this con|cerning him;
<Q>That our Love and Friend&s;hip was con&s;tant and intire unto the End, having been ac|quainted about thirty-five Years, as near as I can remember.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="006297_0212_1028587059FB2368">In the Eleventh Month, as I was meditating in my Clo&s;et, on the Duty and Beauty of that great Virtue of Temperance, it appeared very bright to the View of my Mind, and the great Benefit of it to tho&s;e who loved and lived in it: 1&s;t, As to Religion, it tends to keep the Mind in an even Temper, which is a Help to Devotion, and the Practice of religious Duties. 2dly, It is a great Pre&s;ervative to Health and a good Con&s;titution. 3dly, It is a Ble&s;&s;ing to Po&s;terity, in many Con&s;iderations. Whereas Intemperance de|&s;troys the Health, &s;tains the Reputation, hurts Po&s;te|rity (in re&s;pect to a healthy Con&s;titution of Body, and E&s;tate) ruins many Families, brings to Poverty and Di&s;grace, and, what is yet wor&s;t of all, is a great Lett to Religion and the true Fear of God, and is a great Scandal to any who make Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>In this Month I accompanied <HI>William Piggot</HI> (who lately arrived from <HI>London,</HI> on a religious Vi&s;it to the Meetings of Friends in <HI>America.</HI>) From <HI>Philadelphia</HI> we went to my Hou&s;e at <HI>Franckfort,</HI> and from thence to <HI>North-Wales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">North-Wales.

<P>The 8th of the Twelfth Month was our Youths-meeting at <HI>Franckfort</HI>; many dying about this Time, I was concerned in the Meeting to put Friends in mind of their Mortality; and that I had told Friends lately, at their Meetings at <HI>Abington</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> "That as I was riding from my Hou&s;e to <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> about a Mile from the City, I &s;aw (in the Vi&s;ion of Life) the Hand of the Lord &s;tretched over the Ci|ty and Province, with a Rod in it, in order to correct

the Inhabitants for their Sins and Iniquities; which Sight affected my Mind greatly, and altho' I did not hear any vocal Voice, nor &s;ee any vi&s;ible Hand, yet it was as plainly revealed to me as tho' I had:" And that notwith&s;tanding I under&s;tood &s;ome &s;lighted that Te&s;timony, yet I ob&s;erved to them, that &s;ince that Time, more People were taken away than common, as they now might &s;ee; and indeed that inward Sight and Sen&s;e I had of the Di&s;plea&s;ure of God for the Sins of the Times, made great Impre&s;&s;ion on my Mind; and that no Fle&s;h might glory, the Lord took, from the Evil to come, &s;everal &s;ober, well-inclined young People, as well as divers who&s;e Lives and Con|ver&s;ations were evil and vicious; &s;o that all had need to be warned to be watchful, and turn to the Lord, le&s;t he come at unawares, and call us &s;uddenly out of the World unprepared. In the Twelfth and Fir&s;t Months many died, of all Ages and Profe&s;&s;ions; and now &s;ome, who would hardly give Credit to what I had delivered in &s;everal Meetings, began to &s;ee the Fulfilling of it, and great Talk there was about it: And many &s;olid and large Meetings we had with the People at divers Funerals about this Time, exhorting the People not to &s;light the pre&s;ent Vi&s;itation of the Almighty, and to prepare for Eternity, to meet the Judge of the Quick and the Dead, who &s;tands at the Door. And among many that were taken away by Death, were &s;ome few of my particular Friends; and fir&s;t, dear <HI>Hannah Hill,</HI> who was a bright Example of Piety and Charity, &s;he was like a nur&s;ing Mother to me in my Affliction, as was her Hu&s;band more like a Brother, than one not related, who&s;e generous En|tertainment I may never forget at times. <HI>Thomas Griffith,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Wife, died al&s;o about this Time: <HI>Thomas</HI> was a &s;erviceable Man, and well e|&s;teemed in our Society; and his Wife a noted Wo|man for being helpful to, and vi&s;iting the Sick: She cho&s;e the Hou&s;e of Mourning, rather than the Hou&s;e

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1727.</NOTE>In the Second Month, 1727, I proceeded on a Voyage to <HI>Barbados</HI> on Account of Bu&s;ine&s;s, for the Support of my Family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Voyage to <HI>Barba|dos</HI> on Ac|count of Trade.</NOTE> and in order to di&s;charge my ju&s;t Debts, which were occa&s;ioned by great Lo&s;&s;es by Sea and Land. Many of my Friends were kind to me, and &s;ent a Cargo of Goods, in the Sloop <HI>John, Anthony Peel</HI> Ma&s;ter, con&s;igned to me for Sales and Returns. When the Ve&s;&s;el was loaded, &s;he proceeded down the River, and I went by Land to <HI>Salem,</HI> and was at Meeting there on Fir&s;t-day, and on Third-day went aboard the Sloop at <HI>El&s;enborough</HI>: On the 8th of the Second Month, we took in our Boat and Anchors, and proceeded to Sea. From <HI>El&s;enborough</HI> and the <HI>Capes</HI> I wrote to my Wife, giving her an Account how it was with me, and encouraged her to bear my Ab&s;ence with Patience: It was indeed very hard for us to part.</P>
<P>I may not omit taking Notice of an Exerci&s;e which I felt one Night as I lay on my Bed in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> (on the 21&s;t of the 1&s;t Month, my Sleep being taken from me) which I recollected and wrote down on board the afore&s;aid Ve&s;&s;el, and was in this Manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

the People of the Land, becau&s;e they take not &s;o much Care to &s;uppre&s;s Vice and Wickedne&s;s, and wicked Hou&s;es, in which our Youth are gro&s;sly cor|rupted, as they ought to do: And al&s;o the Lord is angry with many of the better Sort of the People, becau&s;e they &s;eek after and love the Things of this World, more than the Things of his Kingdom: And it was &s;hewed me, that the Anger of the Mo&s;t High would &s;till be again&s;t us, until there was a greater Reformation in the&s;e Things.</Q>
[<HI>It is worthy of Commendation, that our Governor,</HI> Thomas Lloyd, <HI>&s;ometimes in the Evening, before he went to re&s;t, us'd to go in Per&s;on to Publick Hou&s;es, and order the People he found there to their own Hou&s;es, till, at length, he was in&s;trumental to promote better Order, and did, in a great Mea&s;ure, &s;uppre&s;s Vice and Immorality in the City.</HI>]</P>
<P>For &s;ome Days after we were at Sea, the Weather was plea&s;ant, and we had our Health, for which my Heart was truly thankful. I exhorted the Sailors a|gain&s;t Swearing; and tho' they had been much us'd to it, they left it off, &s;o that it was rare to hear any of them &s;wear; for which Reformation, &s;o far, I was glad. I lent and gave them &s;everal good Books, which they read, and &s;hew'd much Re&s;pect to me: But &s;oon after the Wind was contrary (for &s;ome Days) and &s;ome in the Ve&s;&s;el were quarrel&s;ome. I a&s;k'd them what they thought of the Saying of Chri&s;t, <HI>viz. If a Man &s;mite thee on one Cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o?</HI> At which they were &s;ilent, and better conditioned to one another afterwards, and we had &s;ome Reformation both from Fighting and Swearing. This Voy|age I was not &s;o Sea-&s;ick as I formerly had been (tho' I had, before I left Home, &s;ome unea&s;y Thoughts about my u&s;ually being Sea-&s;ick) which I took as a peculiar Favour from Heaven. A|bout the Latitude of 20 Degrees North, we met with Calms and contrary Winds, which was very hard for &s;ome in the Ve&s;&s;el to bear, they putting

them&s;elves much out of Temper about it; as for my own Part, I had been us'd to Di&s;appointments, and therefore did not &s;o much mind it. I &s;pent pretty much of my Time in reading and writing, and God being gracious, it was, in the main, a comfort|able Time to me; and I enjoyed my Health as well as ever I did at Sea in my Life, for which I often breathed forth inward Thanks to the Almighty. On the 5th of the Third Month we arrived at <HI>Barbados,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbados.</NOTE> and I was lovingly received by our Friends, but came to a very low Market for my Goods.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited Friends Meetings on the I&s;land, and had &s;everal open Meetings at <HI>Bridge-Town,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bridge-Town, Spight's-Town, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Spight</HI>'s-<HI>Town,</HI> and likewi&s;e at <HI>Pumpkin-Hill,</HI> and the <HI>Spring.</HI> On the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t</HI> (&s;o called) we had a Meet|ing at <HI>Bridge-Town,</HI> in which was &s;hewn, the Work and Operation of God's Spirit on the Old World, and under the Law; and the everla&s;ting Duration and Operation of the &s;ame Holy Spirit under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, <HI>which,</HI> Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>&s;hould abide forever.</HI> At the Quarterly-meeting at <HI>Spight</HI>'s-<HI>Town,</HI> was Judge <HI>Allen,</HI> and the Captain of the Man of War &s;tationed there, with &s;everal others, not of our Society. I was much drawn forth in this Meeting to &s;peak of the Power of the Father, Son, and the Spirit, opening to the People how we had been mi&s;repre&s;ented, in re&s;pect to our Belief in the Trinity, or the Holy <HI>Three which bear Record in Heaven, the Father, Word, and Spirit, which Three are One</HI>; for that it was clear and plain that we are more orthodox in our Belief in the Deity, than tho&s;e who do not believe in the Operation of the Holy Gho&s;t; as al&s;o that none could be true Chri&s;tians without it. It was queried, How could they be clear in their Belief in the Holy Trinity, or the <HI>Three that bear Record in Heaven,</HI> who believe the Ho|ly Spirit is cea&s;ed in his Operations, Gifts, or imme|diate Revelations, and, if cea&s;ed, when, and where, to whom, and how? The People were very &s;ober and

attentive, and &s;taid all the Time, and after the Meet|ing was done &s;ome Time, divers expre&s;&s;ed their Satis|faction with what was &s;aid. My good Friend <HI>Peter Sharp,</HI> of <HI>Maryland,</HI> was with me at this Meeting, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e Account &s;ome of the People came.

At this Meeting we had each of us a Certificate from Friends, &s;ignifying their Unity with our Conver&s;ations and Services. The la&s;t Meet|ing I had at <HI>Barbados,</HI> was at <HI>Spight</HI>'s-<HI>Town,</HI> on a Fir&s;t-day; it was a &s;olid, good Meeting, in which I took my Leave of Friends there, and exhorted them to believe in and hear Chri&s;t, he being a Teacher that could not be removed from them, as Men often were; and, tho' they were but few, they were de&s;ired to meet in Chri&s;t's Name; and I had to &s;hew them the Difference between us and other Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors, who hold no publick Wor&s;hip, if there be no outward Teacher: Whereas, if but Two or Three meet in the Name of Chri&s;t, he has promi&s;ed to be in the mid&s;t of them; and he is the be&s;t Teacher we can have.</P>
<P>On the 14th of Fourth Month we &s;et Sail from this I&s;land, and, for the mo&s;t Part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At Sea.</NOTE> had fair Weather and fair Winds, and &s;aw &s;everal Ships, but &s;poke with none.</P>
<P>I was one Evening leaning over the Side of the Ve&s;|&s;el, as being very lone&s;ome (having little Conver&s;ation with any in the Ve&s;&s;el, for divers Rea&s;ons) I turned from all outward Things to the Lord, and was glad to feel his Pre&s;ence and Goodne&s;s, which was a Com|fort to me in my lone&s;ome State; and as my Travels and Concerns had called and cau&s;ed me to be much on the Seas, it al&s;o plea&s;ed my good and gracious God, to &s;upport me thereon many Times, in divers Trials, Temptations, and Exerci&s;es; for all which, I bow in awful Reverence before him, and return Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;e to his great Name.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="006297_0218_1028587DC48F05D0">The 1&s;t of the Fifth Month, about Noon, we came to the <HI>Capes of Delaware,</HI> and &s;ailed up the Bay; but, in a little Time, we touch'd the Ground with our Ve&s;&s;el &s;everal Times; there being little Wind, we get no Harm; but two Hours after, or thereabouts, a Gu&s;t, or Storm of Wind, took us, which, if it had met with us on the Shoals where we &s;truck, in all Likelihood we mu&s;t have peri&s;hed; which I took to be a remarkable Deliverance. Next Tide we got to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and, it being Fir&s;t-day, I had a Meeting with Friends there, with which we were greatly re|fre&s;hed in the Lord, and in one another. After Meeting I went on board the Sloop, and, having a fair Wind, we &s;ailed for <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where we arriv|ed about the eleventh Hour, lodged that Night at <HI>Paul Pre&s;ton</HI>'s, and next Day went home to my Fa|mily at <HI>Franckfort,</HI> where my Wife, Children, and Servants, received me with much rejoicing.</P>
<P>When I was in <HI>Barbados, P. M.</HI> who accompanied me from <HI>Bridge-Town</HI> to Windward to Coun&s;ellor <HI>Weeks</HI>'s, told me, "That when I was in the I&s;land before, he and I had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the U&s;e of the Sword, he then (not being of our Society) wore a Sword, but now had left it off, and his Bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o, which was worth &s;ome Hundreds a Year." I had reminded him of Chri&s;t's Words, that, <HI>Tho&s;e who take the Sword, &s;hould peri&s;h with the Sword,</HI> Mat. xxvi. 52. and, <HI>Re&s;i&s;t not Evil, and if a Man &s;mite thee on one Cheek, turn the other al&s;o: Love Enemies, do Good to them that hate you, pray for them who de&s;pite|fully u&s;e you, and per&s;ecute you.</HI> After I had us'd the&s;e Arguments, he a&s;k'd me, <HI>If one came to kill me, would I not kill rather than be killed?</HI> I told him, <HI>No; &s;o far as I know my own Heart, I had rather be killed than kill.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>That was &s;trange, and de&s;ired to know what Rea&s;on I could give for it.</HI> I told him, <HI>That I being innocent, if I were killed in my Body, my Soul might be happy; but if I killed him, he dying in his

Wickedne&s;s, would, con&s;equently, be unhappy; and if I were killed, he might live to repent; but if I killed him, he would have no Time to repent; &s;o that, if he killed me, I &s;hould have much the better, both in re&s;pect to my&s;elf and to him.</HI> This Di&s;cour&s;e had made &s;o much Impre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o affected him, that he &s;aid, he could <HI>not but often remember it.</HI> And when we parted at <HI>Bridge-Town,</HI> we embraced each other, in open Arms of Chri&s;tian Love, far from that which would hurt or de&s;troy.</P>
<P>After I had been at home &s;ome Time, I vi&s;ited the Meetings at <HI>Philadelphia, Burlington</HI> and <HI>Germantown,</HI> in which Places I had Service of divers Kinds, and was lovingly received by Friends and others.</P>
<P>In the Fifth Month, <HI>Jo&s;hua Fielding</HI> and <HI>John Oxley</HI> had a large and &s;atisfactory Meeting at <HI>Franckfort. Jo&s;hua</HI> came from <HI>London</HI> on a religious Vi&s;it to <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> and having been on divers I&s;lands, he landed on the Main at <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and from thence travelled thro' the Wilderne&s;s 400 Miles, or more, where no Publick Friend had ever travelled before: The Jour|ney was perilous, but the Lord was with him; who may, in his own Time, make Way for his Servants in tho&s;e de&s;art Places. <HI>John Oxley</HI> came on the &s;ame Account from <HI>Barbados,</HI> and had good Service among Friends in his publick Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>In this Month we thinking it convenient to &s;end our little Children to School, and not having a School-ma&s;ter of our Society near us, concluded to put our Son and Daughter under the Care of <HI>Nathaniel Walton,</HI> to whom I thought it my Duty to write a few Lines a|bout the Salutation and Language I would have them train'd up in, which were on this wi&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>The latter End of the Fifth, and the Beginning of the Sixth Months, the Weather was exceeding hot, &s;o that divers People dy'd &s;uddenly of the Heat (as it was &s;uppo&s;ed.)</P>
<P>The Beginning of the Sixth Month I was at the Youths-meeting at <HI>Abington,</HI> which was large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abington.</NOTE> and o|pen to many; and I not having been there &s;ince I came from Sea, divers expre&s;&s;ed their Gladne&s;s to &s;ee me; and we were that Day favoured with &s;ome Show|ers, both cele&s;tial and elementary, to our Comfort.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Month I was al&s;o at the Youths-meet|ing in <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> It had been a &s;ickly Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.</NOTE> but many had recovered. That Pa&s;&s;age opened on my Mind, to &s;peak of in the Meeting, concerning the Lepers which Chri&s;t clean&s;ed and healed, being ten in Number, and that but one came to return Thanks to God, for being healed, and re&s;tored to Health, <HI>Luke</HI> xvii. 12. Friends were exhorted to prize their Health, and to &s;hew their Thankfulne&s;s to God, the Giver of it, by fearing and &s;erving him, and taking Heed to Chri&s;t, the Word, in their Hearts. The Meeting was in a good, &s;olid Frame, and we prai&s;ed the Lord to|gether, and gave him Thanks for his merciful Vi&s;itati|on.</P>
<P>About this Time I heard of the Death of our King <HI>(GEORGE the Fir&s;t)</HI> a Prince whom I loved and honoured; which News was very &s;orrowful to me on divers Accounts: His Love and Kindne&s;s to our Soci|ety, was well worthy our grateful Remembrance.</P>
<P>On a Third-day, being our Week-day-meeting at <HI>Franckfort, Elizabeth Whartnaby</HI> and <HI>Mary Smith</HI> were there: It was a comfortable Opportunity. They were two Nights at my Hou&s;e. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was prepa|ring

<P>The latter End of the Sixth Month, I went to the General-meeting of Mini&s;ters and Elders for the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Part of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and to the Quarterly and Youths-Meet|ings at <HI>Burlington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burling|ton.

<P>The 16th of the Seventh Month began our Yearly-meeting at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yearly-meeting at <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI></NOTE> which was attended with the gracious Pre&s;ence of God, to the Comfort and great Satisfaction of many Souls. In this Meeting divers young Men and young Women appeared, who were lately come forth in the Mini&s;try, and, as I believe, had received a Mea&s;ure of the Gift of Chri&s;t's Go&s;pel; which was Cau&s;e of Rejoicing to the Faithful among us, and excited our Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;es to the Al|mighty Lord of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>At this Meeting we had the Company of four Mi|ni&s;ters from <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and one from <HI>Barbados,</HI> and many from divers other Parts, it being a very large Gathering of &s;ome Thou&s;ands of People (as was believed) in which many were &s;trengthened in their Faith in Chri&s;t, and comforted thro' the Power of the

<P>Next Fir&s;t-day after the Yearly-meeting, I, with &s;everal of my Neighbours, went over <HI>Delaware</HI> to a Meeting up <HI>Pen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wken</HI> Creek;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w|ken.</NOTE> in which the wonder|ful Love of God was declared, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng his Son upon Earth, who, as he was Man, died for Man, and is now by his Spirit pre&s;ent with all tho&s;e that truly be|lieve in him; he bring the Me&s;&s;enger of the Cove|nant of God to Mankind.&mdash;And on Second-day, being the 25th of the Seventh Month, I had the &s;or|rowful Tidings of the Death of my beloved Friend <HI>James Lord</HI>; who, on his Death-bed, de&s;ired that I might be &s;ent for to his Burial. In the Con&s;ideration of that Chri&s;tian Love which was between us, I think I may truly note, That we were always glad to meet each other; therefore the Thoughts of this &s;o &s;udden Change, and final Parting, brought, for the pre&s;ent, a Sadne&s;s and Heavine&s;s over my Mind; con&s;idering his Station in that Neighbourhood, and Service in that Congregation to which he did belong; for therein he was well-beloved, and very &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>And Oh! The Lo&s;s that his dear Wife and tender Children will have of him, really affects me with Sor|row in penning the&s;e Notes; but the Sorrow, in the&s;e Things, is all on our Side; for he, without Doubt, is at Re&s;t with his great Ma&s;ter in Heaven. We had a larger Meeting at his Funeral, than ever was known to be there before (as an antient Friend told me) which was &s;olemn and &s;erviceable to many.</P>
<P>Some Time after, having been at divers Meetings about home, <HI>John Oxley</HI> and I, in Company, vi&s;ited Friends on <HI>Long-I&s;land.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Long-I&s;land.</NOTE> At <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI> we were at the Burial of <HI>Jonathan Dicken&s;on:</HI> Many People, of divers Per&s;wa&s;ions, were at the Meeting on that Occa&s;ion, and were very &s;ober and attentive.&mdash;I was at the Yearly-meeting for the South-&s;ide of the I&s;land, at a

<P>I was al&s;o at <HI>Rahaway</HI> River, where was a &s;olid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rahaway.</NOTE> good Meeting. From thence I returned home, having been abroad about a Month, and at above 20 Meet|ings, and travelled above 350 Miles.</P>
<P>In the Eighth Month, at <HI>Franckfort,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Franck|fort.</NOTE> we had three Burials out of one Hou&s;e, at one Time; the Mother, Daughter, and Grand-daughter (of which I had never known the like In&s;tance before) On this Occa&s;ion we had the Company of many Neighbours, and a very &s;olemn Meeting at our Meeting-hou&s;e at <HI>Franckfort.</HI></P>
<P>About this Time I was at divers Meetings at <HI>Phila|delphia, Abington,</HI> and <HI>Burlington:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.

<P>The World &s;till continued to frown upon me; but, tho' my Ca&s;e was &s;uch in this World, yet, at Times, I had great Con&s;olation in Chri&s;t; and, in the Mid&s;t of my Troubles, when I looked back, I could truly &s;ay, That I had not been extravagant, but frugal; not covetous, but charitable; not idle, but indu&s;trious; not willing to be &s;uch an <HI>Infidel</HI> as not to take Care for my Family; it was &s;ome &s;olid Comfort to my Mind;

<P>After I came home from this Voyage, I vi&s;ited the Meetings of Friends at <HI>Philadelphia, Franckfort, Ger|mantown,</HI> the <HI>Falls of Delaware, Burlington, New-Ha|nover, Mount-Holly, Fair-Hill,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The 2d of Ninth Month I was at the Quarterly-meeting of Mini&s;ters and Elders at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.</NOTE> where I met with <HI>Jo&s;eph Taylor,</HI> a Friend, who had vi&s;ited our Meetings pretty generally on the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> in the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel, and was now on his Return homewards, with who&s;e Vi&s;it Friends had good Uni|ty, and certified the &s;ame to our Brethren of the Meet|ing where he lived in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>After this I was at divers Meetings in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI>; and the latter End of the Ninth Month, <HI>Sarah,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Jeremiah Elfreth,</HI> died very &s;ud|denly, having been the Day before walking in her Garden; &s;he was a &s;ober, young Woman, and her Death much lamented; her Burial occa&s;ioned my Stay at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which I had divers Times &s;hun|ned, becau&s;e a Concern had been on me for &s;ome

Time, to declare to the People of that City, "That the Lord was angry with the Legi&s;lators of <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia,</HI> becau&s;e they were not &s;o much concern'd to pro|mote Religion and Piety as they ought, and to make &s;uch Laws as might prevent the exce&s;&s;ive Increa&s;e of Publick Hou&s;es, which often prove Seminaries of Sa|tan; but &s;trove to promote Parties more than Religi|on: And that the Lord was angry with the Magi|&s;trates, becau&s;e they did not &s;o much as they might, and ought to do, put tho&s;e good and whole&s;ome Laws in Execution, which were already made, again&s;t Vice and Immorality: And that the Lord was angry with &s;ome of the better Sort of People, becau&s;e they &s;eek and mind the Things of this World, more than the Things of God and his Kingdom." But I was helped to clear my&s;elf in the Morning-meeting, to the Satisfaction of many of the Hone&s;t-hearted, and un|burden my Mind of a great Exerci&s;e that I had long lain under.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon we had a large Meeting at the Bank-meeting-hou&s;e, occa&s;ioned by the afore&s;aid Bu|rial; the Re&s;urrection of the Dead was declared in that Meeting, according to the Doctrine of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great Author of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, and al&s;o of that eminent Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI>; and that old and fal&s;e Calumny, that our Society denied the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, was publickly denied and refuted. The People were exhorted to live well, that they might die well; and then they need not doubt but that they would ri&s;e well at the Re&s;urrection in the la&s;t Day: The Meeting concluded with Prai&s;e to the Almighty for all his Mercies, and Prayer to him, that he would &s;anctify that Day's Service to the Peo|ple.</P>

<P>The 12th of the Eleventh Month, being Fir&s;t-day, I was at <HI>Hor&s;ham</HI> Meeting, and had a tender bowing Time therein; and in my Way home vi&s;ited &s;ome Friends who were &s;ick, it being a Time of general Vi&s;itation in tho&s;e Parts, and the next Seventh Day I was at the Meeting of Mini&s;ters and Elders at <HI>Phila|delphia,</HI> where we had a good Meeting; here I was earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be at the Funeral of <HI>Edmond Orp|wood,</HI> the elde&s;t Friend belonging to <HI>Franckfort</HI> Meeting;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Franck|fort.</NOTE> but was in a Strait, this Friend, being my Neighbour, and I had before engaged to be at the Burial of one with whom I had been acquainted near 40 Years, therefore I did my Endeavour to be at both, being each of them buried in the Afternoon, and five Miles di&s;tant; the Days being &s;hort al&s;o, divers told me it was imprac|ticable; I told them they might be mi&s;taken, as they were, for though we had a large Meeting, and the Company of <HI>Rowland Wil&s;on,</HI> from <HI>Britain,</HI> who had large and good Service therein, yet after Meeting we mounted, and got to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> about a Quarter of an Hour after the Corps was brought into the Meeting-hou&s;e, as I was informed; we had a large, and, as I thought, a good Meeting, after which I went home, being weary in my Body, but thankful in my Heart,

that the Almighty had been with us, and helped us to perform that Day's Service.</P>
<P>On the 20th of the Eleventh Month, and Second-day of the Week, I went into a Piece of Ground (which I was clearing for Meadow) in order to give Directions to the Workmen, and one of the Trees fell contrary to the Kerf, and al&s;o to the Wind, which was then at North We&s;t, and when I &s;aw it falling towards me, I ran from it, but before I could get out of the Way, it fell upon me, acro&s;s my Book, from my Shoul|der to my Hips, and &s;truck me down to the Earth, where for &s;ome Time I lay &s;peechle&s;s and in all Like|lihood I &s;hould have been immediately kill'd, if I had not been providentially pre&s;erved by the Body of the falling Tree lying on a Stump, which prevented its cru&s;hing me, as I lay on the Ground. A Friend that was near me with a Hor&s;e, de&s;ired the Wood-cut|ters (when they were recovered from the Surpri&s;e, and I to the u&s;e of my Speech) to help me on his Hor&s;e, and I rode home, but in extreme Mi&s;ery, and I was un|der great Concern, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;urprize my Wife and Children &s;uddenly.

<P>As I now found it continue my Bu&s;ine&s;s to go to Sea for a Livelihood, I undertook the Charge of the Ship <HI>New Bri&s;tol Hope,</HI> as Ma&s;ter, tho' it was a Way of Living to which I did not incline; I took care in our Ve&s;&s;el that there &s;hould be no Swearing in my Hearing, nor Drunkenne&s;s, to my Knowledge, without Reproof, and if I could not be in&s;trumental that Way to break them from Swearing, and Drinking to Exce&s;s, my Manner was, to put them away, &s;o that we gene|rally had a pretty quiet Ship.

<P>After this I went to the <HI>Bridge</HI> with a Friend from <HI>New-England</HI>; we had two good Meetings, it being the General-meeting for the Friends of the I&s;land, and afterwards I with &s;everal Friends went again to <HI>Speight</HI>'s <HI>Town,</HI> and on the 12th of the Second Month, I was at the <HI>Thicket</HI>'s-<HI>meeting,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thicket<HI>'s</HI>-meeting.</NOTE> at which was Coun&s;ellor <HI>Weeks,</HI> Colonel <HI>Charnock,</HI> and Ju&s;tice <HI>Sims</HI>; I dined with them at Judge <HI>Weeks</HI>'s, and they di&s;cour&s;ed of what was &s;aid in the Meeting about Dancing, I quoting <HI>Luther</HI>'s Words,
<Q>That as many Paces as the Per&s;on takes in the Dance, &s;o many Paces or Steps they take to|wards Hell:</Q>

<P>In this Voyage a great and weighty Concern came on my Mind, on Account of the young and ri&s;ing Generation, de&s;iring they might be happy in this World, and in that which is to come. And fir&s;t, as to this World,
<Q>I have taken Notice, that divers of the Youth are too apt to wa&s;te their outward Sub|&s;tance, which often is given to them (for when they get it them&s;elves, they are for the mo&s;t part more &s;aving of it) and this Wa&s;ting ard Spending tho&s;e Sparks call Genero&s;ity, Liberality, Good-nature, Gentility, fine Breeding, and Abundance of other fine Names, not con&s;idering the Labour and In|du&s;try, Frugality, Care and Watchings, of their Pa|rents or Ance&s;tors, to get what they have.</Q>
May Parents note this well, and not be anxiou&s;ly concerned to get much Wealth, which may be a Means to ruin their Po&s;terity! And truly mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;pending, drinking, Company-keeping, gaming, chatting, tippling Young&s;ters, take a great Deal more Care, how they may get Money from others, that they may &s;pend it, than how to earn it, or faithfully labour for it them|&s;elves; they will beg or borrow, and run in Debt, but take little or no &s;olid Thoughts to pay; by which Means divers of tho&s;e topping, beggarly Beaus, and Spenders, have brought both them&s;elves and Relations, Parents and Friends, to Shame and Di&s;grace, and
<PB N="227" REF="006297_0239_102858BD898604D0">
&s;ometimes to Poverty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1729.</NOTE> where the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Relations and Pa|rents have been too liberal. Let all indulgent Parents note this al&s;o.</P>
<P>And if any concerned Per&s;on &s;hould advi&s;e tho&s;e in|con&s;iderate Youths of their Evils, 'tis much if they gain not their la&s;ting Ill-will, and the Epithets of Nig|gards and Covetous, ill-natured, cen&s;orious, &s;our, moro&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> However I &s;hall venture to &s;tand the Shock of their Di&s;plea&s;ure, and in as moving Terms as I can, con&s;i&s;tent with the Matter on my Mind, en|treat them to con&s;ider the End of their &s;pending, &s;lothful, idle Life (which if continued in) mu&s;t needs end in their Ruin, and they may repent when it is too late, crying out, "Oh! that I had hearkened to the Advice of my Father, and my indulgent Mother! Oh! that I had taken the Coun&s;el of my good Friends in Time, then I had not beer in this Condition, nor in tho&s;e Straits I am now in." This, or wor&s;e, mu&s;t at la&s;t inevitably be the Condition of tho&s;e unthinking Time-wa&s;ting and Money-&s;pending, evil Company-keeping young People, of both Sexes. Some of whom, if they can get it, will &s;pend more in a few Hours, than their Parents can get in &s;o many Days, which is very unrea&s;onable, as well as unthinking; for if the indul|gent Parents do not hold their Hands, truly they mu&s;t all &s;ink together; and where the Parents have been what the&s;e &s;orts of Youths call liberal, whole Families have by &s;uch Liberality been undone, which is a Ca&s;e to be lamented by all &s;ober People.</P>
<P>I pray our &s;pending Youths to con&s;ider, how many brave, fine young Men and Women, who&s;e Parents have left them E&s;tates and hand&s;ome Incomes, have by &s;uch Extravagancies, &s;oon &s;pent all, and &s;ometimes more than all, and Di&s;grace and a Goal have been their Por|tion; and how many, by living too fa&s;t, have died too &s;oon, much &s;ooner than might be expected, accord|ing to the Cour&s;e of Nature.</P>
<P>Wherefore I would advi&s;e them to regard what the wi&s;e King <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Go to the Aunt, thou Sluggard,

<P>But many Youths object again&s;t this Advice, crying out, as I have often heard, "The aged give this Advice when they are old, but did as we do when they were young, as we are;" although this may be true in &s;ome, yet it will not hold good in the general, and if it do in &s;ome, is not that Maxim Good? "Let others Harms learn us to beware, before it be too late, that we fall not into the &s;ame Snare, which hath en|tangled or caught Thou&s;ands, to their great Shame and reproach." Again, Tho&s;e who have been &s;o over|taken in their Youth, and are e&s;caped out of the Snare, are more fit to caution or advi&s;e how to e&s;cape it, or to &s;hew tho&s;e Paths which led them into that Labyrinth of Woe and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The Author of all Evil u&s;eth his utmo&s;t Skill and Power to promote the Practices of exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> among Mankind, it being a mighty Support to his Kingdom; for when the Nobility of the Under&s;tand|ing is clouded thereby, then Oh! how many wicked Oaths, Oh! what corrupt Language, what unhand|&s;ome, unbecoming Words and Actions, are brought forth!

How is the &s;ober, cha&s;te Soul offended, and, above all other Con|&s;iderations, how is God di&s;honoured, and the End of our Creation fru&s;trated, and Man condemned!</P>
<P>When People are in tho&s;e Exce&s;&s;es, how do they take the &s;acred Name in vain, and &s;o bring them&s;elves in guilty before God, and Man; for he has po&s;itively

<P>At this la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge General-meeting, I exhorted them, To tru&s;t in the Lord, and not to di&s;tru&s;t that Hand which had hitherto pre&s;erved us by his Providence without out|ward Force; and that tho' the People who came among us were many in Number, yet we, having the Lord on our Side, were more than they, in a my&s;tical Sen&s;e; put|ting them in Remembrance of the Prophet, who, when his Servant was afraid, prayed to the Almighty, <HI>To open the Eyes of his Servant, and when they were</HI> my&s;tically <HI>opened, he &s;aw the Mountain full of Chariots of Fire, and Hor&s;es of Fire, and that they were more than their Enemies:</HI> I was al&s;o concerned to exhort Friends to be good Examples to tho&s;e Strangers, who came among us in &s;uch great Numbers; and <HI>that</HI> our <HI>Lights,</HI> in our Conver&s;ations, <HI>might &s;o &s;hine, that</HI> tho&s;e People, <HI>&s;eeing our good Works, might glorify our Father which is in Heaven,</HI> according to the Doctrine of Chri&s;t; and then we &s;hould do them Good, and they would do us no Hurt, but Good al&s;o: But, on the other Hand, if we keep not our Places, and do not live in the Fear of God, nor according to our holy Principles and Profe&s;&s;ion, that then it might be ju&s;t with the Lord God, to make them a Scourge to us.&mdash; Many were comforted in this Meeting, and God was prai&s;ed, who is worthy.</P>

Many thanks were given by many of the People for this Deliverance to the Almighty. <HI>George Leonard,</HI> the Governor of this I&s;land, heard in the Morning, that a Ve&s;&s;el was on the Rocks, and the People were running with Saws and Axes, in order to break her up, if &s;he &s;hould not be got off: The Governor &s;eeing them, &s;ent a Lieutenant with Orders, that let her belong to what Nation &s;o|ever, they &s;hould help to get her off, if it could be, and if &s;he was likely to be made a Wreck, he charged them at their Peril not to meddle with her, nor any Thing belonging to her, until they had fir&s;t come to Terms with the Ma&s;ter, which is worthy to be Re|corded.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd &s;everal Days before we could get our Anchor; for after we were in the Harbour, it blew very hard for four or five Days; &s;o that with four

Oars we could not row our Boat a-head, but watching for a Calm one Night, our People went and got it, and then we went into the principal Road and Harbour in the I&s;land called <HI>Croaker</HI>'s-<HI>Bay</HI>; the Name of that we came from was <HI>Rendezvous-Bay,</HI> where lived a very kind Friend of ours, named <HI>John Rumney,</HI> who, with his Wife and Family, treated us with great Love, and courteou&s;ly received us in their Hou&s;e, and he went with me to the Governor's, who was my old Acquain|tance and Friend, who, with much Love and Tender|ne&s;s (when he knew me) took me in his Arms, and embraced me, and lovingly &s;aluted me with a Ki&s;s of Charity, and thanked God for our Deliverance, and that he had lived to &s;ee me once more (I having been there &s;ome Years before) he was &s;eventy odd Years of Age, as I remember, and had eighty odd who called him Father: They living much on Roots and Pul&s;e, are very healthy in this I&s;land. I was here nine Days, and had &s;even Meetings with the People; the longer I &s;taid the larger the Meetings were; &s;o that I had &s;ome Difficulty to leave them. Through the Grace and Gift of God I was helped to preach the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t freely, and they received it both freely and thankfully, divers, if not all; for theirs and my Heart was very open one to another, the holy Lord's Name be prai&s;ed forever</P>
<P>The 3d of the Fir&s;t Month, <HI>Ezra Worthington</HI> died, and the 4th in the Afternoon, he was buried on the Plantation of <HI>John Rumney,</HI> near his Hou&s;e; the Go|vernor and his Son in Law were at the Burial, where I told them, that he was an inoffen&s;ive, innocent, &s;ober young Man, and that Death was to be the End of us here, putting them in mind to remember their latter End. After I had done &s;peaking, the Governor &s;aid,
<Q>That Death was a Debt due to Nature, and that we mu&s;t all pay it, and ble&s;&s;ed is the Man that in Time truly prepares for it.</Q>
This was a good Expre&s;&s;ion for a Man in his Po&s;t, and worthy of my Notice&punc; as I thought.</P>

<P>The 20th of the Fir&s;t Month, being the fir&s;t of the Week, we had a comfortable Meeting for Divine Wor&s;hip, in which the Goodne&s;s of God was extend|ed to us as we were rowling on the mighty Waters of the great Deep, after which we had plea&s;ant Weather, and a fair Wind, for &s;everal Days.</P>
<P>On the 26th the Wind &s;prung up at Ea&s;t North-Ea&s;t, a hard Gale, which la&s;ted &s;everal Days; and having but little Sea-room for about thirty Hours, it blew &s;o hard, that we could dre&s;s no Victuals: I then thought on the Words of <HI>Job,</HI> when he &s;poke to his impatient Wife, &s;aying 'Shall we receive Good at the Hand of God, and &s;hall we not receive Evil al&s;o?

were taken off the Stage of this Life in the City of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and I was concerned to exhort Friends in that City to bring their Children to Meetings, and educate them, when young, in the Way they &s;hould go, that they might not depart from it when old; and that he who had taken many away, could, if he plea&s;ed, take many more; or though he might have laid down his Rod at pre&s;ent (the Di&s;temper in the City being much abated) he could &s;oon take it up again.

<P>I was clearing out our Ve&s;&s;el when this Storm hap|pened, and being twelve Miles off, could not hear of or concerning her, but thought it altogether unlikely that &s;he &s;hould ride out &s;o great a Storm, in &s;o bad a Harbour or Road, it being open to the Sea, and &s;uch a Storm as had not been known for many Years, and &s;ome &s;aid, never but one (to their Knowledge) though much more Damage hath at &s;ome other Times been done to the Shipping, by rea&s;on that the harde&s;t of of the Wind was not that Way, which was mo&s;t dan|gerous to them in <HI>Carli&s;le-Bay,</HI> where they mo&s;tly lay; for they all got out to Sea, except two or three that were lo&s;t by the violence of the Weather.

When I had cleared our Ship, I &s;et forward in order to &s;ee what was become of her; but the Floods were &s;o out, and the Ways were &s;o bad, I could not without &s;ome Danger get to her that Night; but next Morning I &s;et out from <HI>Jo&s;eph Gamble</HI>'s, and, to my Admiration, from the Top of a Hill (on which a Hou&s;e in the Storm was blown flat to the Ground) I &s;aw our Ship at an Anchor, having rode out the Storm, with one Sloop by her, for which cau&s;e my Soul was humbly thankful.</P>

The 5th of the Month, being the fir&s;t Day of the Week, we had a good religious Meeting, for divine Wor&s;hip, wherein our People were earne&s;tly exhorted to a holy Life, and

<P><PB N="249" REF="006297_0261_102858FF6E923208">The 12th of the Twelfth Month, we met with ano|ther Ea&s;terly Storm, being in about thirty Fathom Water, it blew, and rain'd very hard, and was al&s;o exceeding cold, and our coming from a hot Climate made it more hard to bear. In this Storm we &s;aw di|vers Lights, which the Sailors call <HI>Corpu&s;ants,</HI> one of them was exceeding bright, and &s;at, as near as I can compute it, about Half an Hour on our Main-top|ma&s;t Head, plain to the View of all the Ship's Com|pany, divers of whom &s;aid they never &s;aw the like, and I think I never heard of, or &s;aw the like before.</P>
<P>The Storm continued all Night till Day, when it abated, and, it being the Fir&s;t of the Week, we had a comfortable Meeting, in which the People on board were advi&s;ed to get divine and heavenly Learning, and not to be Fools in Religion, or in the Things of God, nor to hate his true Knowledge; for if they had all the natural Knowledge, and brighte&s;t natural Parts in the World, they would be but Fools without <HI>the true Fear of God,</HI> which the wi&s;e King <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Is the Beginning of Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>The 27th of the Month we &s;aw <HI>Cape Henlopen,</HI> having been 27Days from the I&s;land of <HI>Barbados:</HI> This was a clo&s;e, foggy Day, we could &s;ee but very little before us, and had like to have been a-ground on the Shoals, which they call the <HI>Hen and Chickens,</HI> but went between them and the <HI>Cape,</HI> in three Fathom Water; the Wind blowing hard at South, we went up the Bay by the Lead; for we could not &s;ee Land; and the Gale being &s;o fre&s;h, we got to <HI>Bombay-Hook,</HI> from our <HI>Capes,</HI> in about &s;ix Hours, which is accounted twenty Leagues; where we came to an Anchor, and there met with abundance of Ice.

us, which &s;urprized &s;ome of us much. The &s;udden coming out of &s;o hot a Climate, into one &s;o &s;everely cold, had a bad Effect on mo&s;t of our Ship's Compa|ny; and, for my own Part, I had a &s;ore Fit of the <HI>Phthy&s;ick,</HI> and was, at times, almo&s;t breathle&s;s, and thought I mu&s;t die, for I could hardly breath, or &s;peak; but yet I re&s;olved, as long as I was capable of Thoughts, I would think of God, and my beloved Je&s;us; in which Thoughts and Meditations I found &s;ome Comfort and Con&s;olation. I &s;at up for divers Nights, not being able to lie down for want of Breath; and I could not drink any &s;trong Drink, as Rum, Wine, Ale, or Punch, &s;uch as the Sailors drank; but, in&s;tead thereof, I drank Sage Tea, which was very helpful to me.</P>
<P>The next Day, the Ice came down more and more upon us, and we feared to put back, becau&s;e, if we had gone a-ground in the Bay, the Ice might have demo|li&s;hed us; &s;o we took the mo&s;t convenient Time we could, and got up our Anchor, with &s;ome Difficulty, and &s;tood for <HI>Reedy-I&s;land,</HI> one of the be&s;t Harbours upon <HI>Delaware</HI>; but, the Wind and Tide &s;ailing us, we could not get in; and the Ebb brought down the Ice mightily on us, &s;o that it took away the Head of our Ve&s;&s;el, and cut her Sides very much. The next Tide we got into the Harbour, and lay clo&s;e to <HI>Reedy-I&s;land,</HI> making the Ship fa&s;t on Shore. While we lay here, &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els came to us, and fa&s;ten'd on Shore as we did. The Ice drove one Ve&s;&s;el on us, and broke our Sprit&s;ail Yard. Here I went on Shore, where the People were very kind to us, particularly the Sheriff of the County, <HI>John Gooding,</HI> and his Wife and Family. I went al&s;o to the Hou&s;e of <HI>John M' Coel,</HI> who, with his Wife, were very tender in their Care and Love towards me; bathing my &s;well'd and be|numm'd Limbs until the Fro&s;t was pretty well out of them.

For the&s;e Meetings I was truly thankful; for though, through the extream Cold, I could hardly &s;peak when on board, I now &s;poke freely, much to my Admiration, and I believe to the People's Satisfaction, more than is proper for me to mention, wherefore I prai&s;e God. When the Wea|ther was a little more open, and the Ice gone, we &s;ailed up the River to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.</NOTE> where I was joy|fully received by my Friends; and while the Ve&s;&s;el was repairing and fitting for another Voyage, I was not idle, but vi&s;ited Friends Meetings at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burling|ton.

<P>The 4th of the Third Month we again &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Speight's-Town,</HI> in <HI>Barbados</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An eighth Voyaye as Ma&s;ter, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the 6th of the Month, about &s;ix in the Morning, left the <HI>Capes of Delaware.</HI> From the Time we left the Sight of the <HI>Capes of Delaware,</HI> to the Sight of <HI>Barbados,</HI> was Twenty-five Days (which was the quicke&s;t Voyage that ever I had in this Ship) in which Time we had three Meetings for the publick Wor&s;hip of Almighty God, and to me they were beneficial; and for God's Goodne&s;s, I could do no le&s;s than return Prai&s;e to Him, who alone is worthy forever.</P>
<P>After I had done my Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Barbados,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbados.</NOTE> and vi&s;ited Friends Meetings on the 5th of the Fifth Month, I &s;ailed for <HI>South Carolina,</HI> touched at the I&s;land of <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> and landed &s;ome Pa&s;&s;engers there.<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Chri|&s;tophers.</NOTE> From thence we went to Sea, and the &s;ame Night we had a

<P>We were prevented by contrary Winds, and a &s;trong Current, from getting into <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> and while we were beating about the Coa&s;t, we met with a Ve&s;&s;el, which came from thence, who gave us In|telligence that many People died &s;uddenly, and that they buried ten or twelve in a Day. Hearing &s;uch News, and the Wind being &s;till again&s;t us, our Pa&s;&s;en|gers, who intended for <HI>Carolina,</HI> concluded to go for <HI>Philadelphia</HI>; &s;o we tacked about, and &s;tood for <HI>Dela|ware-Bay,</HI> and then we had a fre&s;h Gale a-head again for &s;everal Days, and &s;pending &s;o much Time on the Coa&s;t, our Water was far expended, and we agreed to come to an Allowance of Water, a Quart a Man for Twenty-four Hours, for &s;everal Days before we got in. We were about five Weeks in our Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Barbados</HI> to <HI>Delaware</HI> River.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel|phia.</NOTE>Soon after our Arrival at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> we got our Ship on the Ways, in order to refit and &s;heath her, in which Time I travelled into &s;everal Counties, and had many religious Meetings in divers Places, in which I had good Satisfaction; and my old Acquaintance and Friends &s;aid, they rejoiced to &s;ee me again after my Sea Voyages. I was thankful in my Heart for the Good|will of my Good Ma&s;ter, and of my Friends, in tho&s;e Journeys, which was, and, I hope, ever will be better to me than choice Silver, and fine Gold.</P>
<P>The Winter &s;etting in about a Month &s;ooner than u&s;ual, many Ve&s;&s;els were detained from going to Sea, being frozen up; al&s;o many Ve&s;&s;els could not come

from Sea up the River, &s;o that a great Damp was put on Trade, and the Fro&s;t coming &s;o &s;uddenly, many People were taken with Colds, and many died in both the Provinces of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> My dear Friend and kind Landlord <HI>Paul Pre&s;ton,</HI> died about this Time, who, on his dying Bed, &s;aid, 'He had no De&s;ire to live, but to do Good, and that it had been his Care to keep a Con&s;cience void of Offence to|wards God, and to all Men, which now was his Com|fort.' The hard Weather continuing, I found an Exerci&s;e and Concern on my Mind to vi&s;it Friends Meetings in the County of <HI>Bucks,</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania,</HI> and the County of <HI>Burlington,</HI> in <HI>We&s;t Jer&s;ey</HI>; in both which I was at above twenty Meetings in about twenty Days. In this Journey I was favoured with the Grace and Goodne&s;s of the Divine Hand to a greater Degree than I was worthy of, though I was &s;ometimes exceeding poor in my Spirit, and, in my own Judgment, very weak for Service and Labour, both in Body and Mind; our Meetings, con&s;idering the &s;evere Sea&s;on, were large, and, I hope, they were to general Edification.</P>

Some that were at this Meeting, who did not profe&s;s with us, came over the Creek on the Ice to <HI>I&s;aac Horner</HI>'s, in the Even|ing, where we had a &s;atisfactory Meeting, in which God, through Chri&s;t was glorified. <HI>Daniel Stanton</HI> (my Wife's Si&s;ter's Son) accompanied me in this

<P>After I came home, I was at the Marriage of <HI>Wil|liam Parker,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth Gilbert,</HI> at which Marriage was our worthy, antient Friend, <HI>John Richard&s;on,</HI> with divers other European Friends. The Meeting was large and edifying.</P>

About the Beginning of the Eighth Month (being in the Latitude of <HI>Barbados</HI>) the Thoughts of my leaving my Family and Habitation, and many of my loving Relations, and near and dear Friends (as at divers other times al&s;o) made me pen|&s;ive and &s;orrowful; but it being on a Principle of Ju|&s;tice, and &s;ometimes meeting with the Pre&s;ence and Goodne&s;s of God, I was enabled to do my Affairs and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and forbore to appear &s;orrowful as much as po&s;&s;ibly I could, or to be of a &s;ad Countenance in the Sight of Men; but to him, who knew all Things, and &s;ees in &s;ecret, I poured out my Soul in all my Af|flictions, for he only is able to help me. I met with &s;ome who untruly cen&s;ured me, as covetous of the Things of this World, or to be rich; and that for the &s;ake of the&s;e outward Things, I might venture my Life, until I might lo&s;e it: Really, as to my Life, it hath long been my De&s;ire to be ready to re&s;ign it, and is &s;o &s;till: And, as to tho&s;e outward Things, &s;o far as I know, my Heart is clear; Food and Rai|ment, and to be clear and even with the World, ha|ving rather to give than receive, is all the Grandeur I de&s;ire; and if that be not granted, I hope to be con|tented without it, and to be thankful. I look upon Crowns and Sceptres, and all the fine Things of this World, that are of the Nature of it, but as Trifles, and diminutive Things, in Compari&s;on of a Hou&s;e and Kingdom eternal in the Heavens.

<P>The 21&s;t of the Ninth Month, we had a very hard Gale of Wind at North-we&s;t, which blew &s;o hard, that it put us by from &s;ailing, &s;o that we were obliged to lay her to the Wind; for, by the Violence thereof, we could not carry any Sail; and it was &s;o dark, that we could neither &s;ee Stars, nor one another; nor hear one another, without we were very near, the Seas ri&s;ing very high: Indeed the long, &s;tormy and dark Nights were very di&s;mal; and &s;ome of our Goods got loo&s;e in the Hold.

<P>He and his Wife were both very courteous to me, and invited many of his rich Friends and Relations: His Wife's Father was a Judge in this I&s;land of good Repute. Divers People, of &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions, were at this Meeting, and many expre&s;&s;ed their being glad

of it. An Attorney at Law &s;aid, "He was thankful for the Words he heard that Day, and, if I would &s;tay with them, he would always come to our Meet|ings." One Judge <HI>Mills</HI> was at this Meeting, and very kindly invited me to his Hou&s;e. Some meeting me next Day, &s;aid, They were &s;orry they were not there. The Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e told divers of the People, who were Per&s;ons of Note, "That they &s;hould remember what they had heard;" and &s;poke it with a religious Concern, as it &s;eem'd to me. When I went to this Meeting, I was very poor, and in much Fear, &s;peaking with a great Concern on my Mind for the People's Salvation, and that God, thro' Chri&s;t, might be glorified.</P>
<P>After this Meeting, it was (as tho' a Voice) &s;aid unto me, <HI>How do&s;t thou know but for this Cau&s;e, and for this Meeting, thou art brought here to this I&s;land, tho' again&s;t thy Will?</HI> The People told me that they did not remember that there ever was a Meeting of our Friends before on the I&s;land. The Meeting had this Effect, that the People had a better Opinion of our Society than they had before. The Subject in this Meeting was, The Excellency of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen|&s;ation above that of the Law, in that it brought us to the Law, went through the Law, and was above the Law, and far from de&s;troying the Law, but fulfilled it; for Proof of which, they were referred to Chri&s;t's mo&s;t excellent Sermon which he preached on the <HI>Mount,</HI> Mat. v.</P>
<P>From the I&s;land of <HI>Christopher</HI>'s I purpo&s;ed, God willing, for <HI>Barbados</HI>; the which I apprehended would be a trouble&s;ome Voyage, it being about 100 Leagues to Windward, and a &s;trong Current again&s;t us. On the 19th of the Twelfth Month, we &s;ailed towards <HI>Barbados</HI>; and the Wind being a-head, and blowing hard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucea.</NOTE> we tarried two Nights at the I&s;land of <HI>Lucea,</HI> where we took in Wood and Water: The People here were mo&s;tly <HI>French,</HI> and were very civil to us.</P>

<P>We went out again, in order to proceed to <HI>Barba|dos</HI>; but, as before, the Current was &s;o &s;trong again&s;t us, and the Wind al&s;o, that we could not get forward on our Way; wherefore we put back again to <HI>Chri|&s;topher</HI>'s, and, by the Way, called at <HI>Antigua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antigua.</NOTE> where I had an open, &s;ati&s;factory Meeting, for which I was truly thankful, and &s;o were &s;ome, not of our Society, of whom there were divers, and &s;ome who had not been at our Meetings before.</P>

<P>In loading our Ve&s;&s;el, Judge <HI>Brown</HI> was my very good Friend, and helpful to me therein, for which I think my &s;elf much obliged to him.</P>
<P>While we lay here, I had a Meeting on board our Ve&s;&s;el, to which came five Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els. It was a good Meeting, tho' I &s;poke to them in much Mi&s;ery and Pain, having very angry painful Sores on my Legs, occa&s;ioned by a Fall in getting out of the Boat, the Seas running high, and through the Violence of the Waves, I fell acro&s;s the Boat, and broke both my Shins very grievou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t of the Fir&s;t Month, 1734,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1734.</NOTE> we had ano|ther Meeting on board our Ve&s;&s;el, to which came &s;e|veral from other Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ome from the Shore, a|mong whom was a young Baronet, and his Ho&s;t (a

<P>I was invited to have a Meeting next Fir&s;t-day on board the Ship <HI>King George,</HI> a large Ve&s;&s;el; the Ma|&s;ter told me his Cabin was large, and would accom|modate many more than mine; but we did not &s;tay &s;o long as till the Fir&s;t-day.</P>
<P>After this Meeting was over, the Ma&s;ter of the large Ship came on board, and &s;aid, "He was &s;orry he had not come &s;ooner, &s;o as to have had the Oppor|tunity to have been at the Meeting."</P>

We &s;taid at <HI>Anguilla</HI> three Days, and there took on board &s;ome Bags of Cotton on Freight, and &s;ailed from thence the 10th of the Second Month. The Governor of this I&s;land, who&s;e Name is <HI>George Leonard,</HI> told me, "That he &s;hould live and die in our Principles, &s;aving that he mu&s;t defend his People." But he did not con&s;ider, that his Defence might de|&s;troy both him and them, and that &s;uch Defence was directly contrary to Chri&s;t's Doctrine and Practice. A remarkable and di&s;mal Pa&s;&s;age he related to me, that, &s;ome Days before, a Ve&s;&s;el came from the I&s;land of <HI>Saltitudas</HI> (which went there to take in Salt) the People going on Shore, the Ma&s;ter told him, that there lay at the Landing the Heads of above twenty Men on one Side the Path, and the Quarters of them on the o|ther; which &s;o &s;urprized them, that they made the be&s;t of their Way to <HI>Anguilla,</HI> where they related this di&s;mal Story, and &s;uppo&s;ed the Slain to be <HI>Britons</HI> by their Appearances, and that they were de&s;troyed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who are known to be cruel to them: This Action being far from the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, is a Reproach to the Actors thereof.</P>

<P>When I came home from this Voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives at <HI>Philadel|phia.</HI></NOTE> which was the 30th of the Second Month, I met with the &s;or|rowful News of the Death of my only Son <HI>George,</HI> a beloved, dear Youth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the Death of his Son <HI>George.</HI></NOTE> who was taken &s;ick the fifth of the Eighth Month, 1733, and departed this Life at my Hou&s;e in <HI>Franckfort,</HI> the 13th of &s;aid Month, a|bout the ninth Hour, in the Evening of the &s;ixth Day of the Week, and was carried to the Bank Meeting-hou&s;e of Friends in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and buried from thence on the fir&s;t Day following, being accompanied by many Friends, and others; he was ten years and &s;even Days old, when he died, and, as he was much beloved for the Sweetne&s;s of his Nature and Di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o he was greatly lamented by many who were acquainted with him. I have this Account to leave concerning him, not &s;o much that he was my Son, as to excite other Youths to &s;erve and fear the Lord, and to love him above all, and that they might remember their Creator in their youthtul Days, that it might be well with them in this World, and when Time here to them &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P><Q>He was a Lad much inclined to read the Holy Scriptures, and other good Books, e&s;pecially reli|gious Ones; and was always obliging, obedient and and loving, to his Parents, and ready and willing to
<PB N="266" REF="006297_0278_10285934B70DD388">
do any Service he could to his Friends; any little Services in his Power he chearfully performed, and took delight in; he was very diligent, and ready to go to religious Meetings, and an entire Lover of re|ligious People. In his Sickne&s;s he behaved him|&s;elf more like a wi&s;e Man, than a Youth of that Age, bearing his Pain and Sickne&s;s with a great deal of Patience. I being in another Part of the World, he would gladly have &s;een me, but &s;aid, he &s;hould ne|ver &s;ee me any more, and therefore de&s;ired his Mother to remember his dear Love to his Father, and tell him, that he was gone to his Heavenly Fa|ther. He was very fervent in Prayer in the Time of his Sickne&s;s, and prayed that God would pre&s;erve his People all the World over. One time, when in great Mi&s;ery and Pain, he prayed to Chri&s;t, &s;ay|ing, Sweet Je&s;us! Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us! give me Patience to bear my Mi&s;ery and Pain, for my Mi&s;ery is greater than I can well bear! O come, &s;weet Je&s;us, why art thou &s;o long a coming? I had rather be with thee than in the fine&s;t Place in all the World. Many religious Expre&s;&s;ions he &s;poke on his dying Bed, greatly to the Satisfaction and Melting of his Friends and Relations who came to &s;ee him in his Illne&s;s; one Day he &s;aid, My mi&s;ery and Pain is very great, but what would it be if the Wrath of God was in my Soul? He believing in the Love of God in Chri&s;t, made him de&s;irous of being with him, and &s;eeing the Joy that was &s;et before him, thought the Time long to be with Je&s;us, as knowing that then he would be out of all Mi&s;ery and Pain. His Heart was full of Love to his Relations, Acquaintance and Friends, who came to &s;ee him in his Illne&s;s; and full of tender Sweetne&s;s and Divine Love, he took his la&s;t Leave of them, which greatly affected many. This was one of the mo&s;t pinching Excerci&s;es I ever met with in all my Days; but as he &s;aid in his Illne&s;s, &s;o I now write. The Wi&s;dom of the Lord is
<PB N="267" REF="006297_0279_102859379D1BCC28">
wonderful. One time in this dear Child's Sickne&s;s he &s;aid, Oh! the good Hand of Thee the Lord help me, give me Ea&s;e, and conduct me &s;afe <HI>(i. e.)</HI> to God's Kingdom, uttering this Ver&s;e:</Q>
<Q><L>Sweet Je&s;us, give me Ea&s;e, for Mercy I do crave;</L>
<L>And if thou'll give me Ea&s;e, then Mercy I &s;hall have.</L></Q></P>
<P>Altho' this was a great and &s;ore Exerci&s;e, and deep Affliction to me, in lo&s;ing this promi&s;ing Youth, and my only Son; yet, con&s;idering that he went off the Stage of Life like a &s;olid, good Chri&s;tian, it was made tolerable ea&s;y to me; for he departed this Life in much Brightne&s;s and Sweetne&s;s, and more like an old Chri|&s;tian, than a Youth of ten Years of Age.</P>
<P>It was u&s;ual for me to advi&s;e his Mother not to &s;et her Affections too much upon him, thinking he was too good to live long in this World, and too ripe for Hea|ven, to &s;tay long here on Earth, or in this World of Sorrow and Mi&s;ery. This dear and tender Youth, when reading (to which he was much inclined) if he met with any Thing that affected him, either in the &s;acred Writings, or other good Authors, he would write it down, and get it by Heart; he was, more than common, affectionately concerned for his Mother, doing whatever he could freely and cheerfully to &s;erve her, and told her not to do divers Things which he thought too much for her, &s;aying,
<Q>Mother, let me do it, if I were a Man, thou &s;hould not do any Thing at all (meaning as to Labour,</Q>) My dear Wife, being very indu&s;trious, and apt to overdo her &s;elf at times: And &s;he being affected with his filial Love and Care for and towards her in his Father's Ab&s;ence, it cau&s;ed her &s;ometimes to turn about and weep, in Con&s;ideration of his great Care for and Love to her. I thought a little Me|morandum of the Life and Death of this religious Lad was worthy recording, in order to &s;tir up other Youths to Obedience and Love to their Parents, who begat them, and carefully and tenderly nouri&s;hed and brought them up; and al&s;o to love and obey God, from whom
<PB N="268" REF="006297_0280_102859396CD591D0">
they have their Life, Breath and Being, and to believe in Chri&s;t, who died for them; who is the glorious Light of all the Nations of them that are &s;aved, and walk therein, according to &s;acred Writ.</P>
<P>As noted above, he got &s;everal Pieces by Heart out of the Bible, and other Religious Writings, fir&s;t writ|ing them with his Pen. Two &s;hort Ones I may Recite, of which nature were divers others, which peradven|ture may be edifying to &s;ome, who may ca&s;t their Eye thereon.</P>
<P>One Place which much affected my Mind that he wrote down, and got by Heart, was the 15th Ver&s;e of the 57th Chapter of that evangelical Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah: For thus &s;aith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth Eternity, who&s;e Name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy Place, with him al&s;o that is of a contrite and hum|ble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the Humble, and to re|vive the Heart of the contrite Ones.</HI></P>
<P>Another little Piece was five Ver&s;es, which among others he wrote, and got by Heart, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbados.</NOTE>My Stay at <HI>Barbados</HI> this time was the longe&s;t I ever &s;tay'd, believing it to be the la&s;t time I &s;hould go there, and that I &s;hould &s;ee them no more.

<P>Here I met with <HI>Mo&s;es Aldridge,</HI> a Friend from <HI>New-England,</HI> who came on a religious Vi&s;it to Friends of this I&s;land, with whom we had divers good Meet|ings, his Service in Preaching the Go&s;pel being edify|ing and acceptable; we were together at the Marriage of <HI>Andrew Dury</HI> and <HI>Mary Lewis,</HI> after which Meet|ting and Marriage, I was ill of a Fever &s;everal Days, which Di&s;temper was very much among the People, of which near twenty Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ome Hun|dreds of People died; and though I had been at <HI>Bar|bados</HI> many times, I never had &s;o much Illne&s;s there be|fore; <HI>Mo&s;es Aldridge,</HI> and &s;everal Friends of us, had a large Meeting at <HI>John Gib&s;on's,</HI> where were many People, not of our Per&s;wa&s;ion, who generally were &s;ober; but as I was recommending Charity to the People, according to the Doctrine of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> as the mo&s;t excel|lent Gift, I advi&s;ed them to &s;how it forth to all People of all Profe&s;&s;ions, and al&s;o to their Negroes, telling

The 22d, being Fir&s;t-day, we had a com|fortable Meeting after the Storm, wherein the great Benefit of true Religion was a little open'd to our &s;mall Company, and the Lord, Mo&s;t High, was prai&s;ed for our Deliverance and Pre&s;ervation.

<P>In the Beginning of the Fifth Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">London.</NOTE> I came to <HI>London,</HI> and lodged at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Simeon Warner,</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and at divers kind Friends and Relations in and about <HI>London</HI>; the tender and brotherly Re&s;pect which I received from divers, in &s;ome of tho&s;e Fami|lies, in my Sickne&s;s, will not, I believe, ever be for|gotten, while I am in this World, at times, by me; and, I hope, that He, whom I &s;erve with my Might and Strength, will be their Reward. When in the Country about <HI>London,</HI> my Re&s;idence was mo&s;tly at <HI>Edmonton,</HI> at my dear Brother <HI>George Chalkley</HI>'s, who, with my Si&s;ter and Cou&s;ins, were a Comfort to me, both in Health and Sickne&s;s; for I was often in <HI>Lon|don</HI> &s;orely afflicted with the <HI>Phthy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>A&s;thma,</HI> which &s;ometimes made me very unea&s;y; and, though my Affairs required me to be often at the City, yet I was obliged to return into the Country for Air, and, both in Health and Sickne&s;s, was kindly and very af|fectionately received and tended by my dear Brother, Si|&s;ter, and all my loving Cou&s;ins; the Memory thereof is Cordial to me in penning the&s;e Lines: It may be truly &s;aid, We were very joyful in meeting one ano|ther; and our Sorrow in parting not ea&s;y to be expre&s;|&s;ed.</P>

me &s;o far as to &s;ee it accompli&s;hed; &s;o that I now wholly intended to leave trading by Sea, the which I never inclined to, only on a Principle of Ju&s;tice; for I was fully re&s;olved in my Mind that my Creditors &s;hould be paid their ju&s;t Debts, though I might lo&s;e my Life in the Pur&s;uit of it, about which I had no anxious Guilt, becau&s;e I never was extravagant nor indolent, but met with divers Ca&s;ualties by Fire and Water; by the latter I lo&s;t many Hundreds of Pounds for &s;everal Years together; and I would per|&s;uade all in their Undertaking for a Livelihood in this World, to be &s;ure to have an Eye to Divine Provi|dence, who will not &s;uffer us (if we do well) nor &s;o much as a Sparrow to fall to the Ground, without he think it be&s;t for us, he knowing what is for our Good better than we know our&s;elves. Thus when I had paid my Debts, and in a good Degree &s;ettled my Affairs, I vi&s;ited &s;everal of my Relations, as at <HI>King&s;worth, Stains, Guilford,</HI> &amp;c. had a Meeting at <HI>Market-Street,</HI> and one at <HI>Guilford,</HI> another at <HI>Stains,</HI> and one at <HI>Long|ford</HI>; in all which I had &s;ome Service, and my Re|lations were joyful to &s;ee me once more, having never expected to &s;ee me again; and when I had vi&s;ited Meetings in and about <HI>London,</HI> I went towards the North, in order to vi&s;it &s;ome Places where I had never been, and &s;ome that I had been at. The Number of Meetings, and the Names of the Places where I had Meetings (while I was this time in <HI>England</HI>) are as fol|lows: While I was in and about <HI>London,</HI> I was at eighteen Meetings in that great City, at two of which I was with <HI>May Drummond,</HI> a virtuous young Woman, who hath a good Gift in the Mini&s;try, and had a gra|cious Opportunity of declaring her Convincement to our noble Queen <HI>Caroline</HI> (our great King <HI>George</HI>'s royal Con&s;ort.)

There was a Multitude of People at the Burial, among whom we had a good Opportunity to invite them to lay hold of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and prepare for another World. They were reminded, that neither natural Wi&s;dom, nor Riches, Youth nor Strength, Crowns nor Scepters, would, nor could &s;e|cure them from the Stroke of Death. <HI>Robert Jordan</HI> was at this Meeting, and had good Service therein; it concluded in Supplication for the Widow and Fa|therle&s;s, and for Mankind univer&s;ally.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1738.</NOTE>The latter End of the Fir&s;t Month I was at the Bu|rial of <HI>Robert Evan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">North-Wales.</NOTE> of <HI>North-Wales</HI>; he was upwards of four&s;core Years of Age, and one of the fir&s;t Settlers there.

<P>HAVING a Concern for your Welfare and Pro&s;perity, both now and hereafter, and al&s;o the Pro&s;perity of your Children, I had a De&s;ire to &s;ee you; but being in Years, and heavy, and much &s;pent and fatigued with my long Journeys in <HI>Virgi|nia</HI> and <HI>Carolina,</HI> makes it &s;eem too hard for me to perform a Vi&s;it in Per&s;on to you; wherefore I take
<PB N="308" REF="006297_0320_102859ABD5693F38">
this Way of Writing to di&s;charge my Mind of what lies weightily thereon: And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I de&s;ire that you be very careful (being far and back Inhabitants) to keep a friendly Corre&s;pon|dence with the native <HI>Indians,</HI> giving them no Oc|ca&s;ion of Offence; they being a cruel and mercile&s;s Enemy, where they think they are wrong'd or de|frauded of their Right, as woful Experience hath taught, in <HI>Carolina, Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> and, e|&s;pecially, in <HI>New-England,</HI> &amp;c. And,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As Nature hath given them, and their Fore-fathers, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Continent of <HI>Ame|rica</HI> (or this Wilderne&s;s) they have a natural Right there|to in Ju&s;tice and Equity; and no People, according to the Law of Nature and Ju&s;tice, and our own Prin|ciple, which is according to the glorious Go&s;pel of our dear and holy Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ought to take away, or &s;ettle, on other Mens Lands or Rights, without Con&s;ent, or purcha&s;ing the &s;ame, by Agree|ment of the Parties concern'd; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, in your Ca&s;e, is not yet done.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Therefore my Coun&s;el and Chri&s;tian Ad|vice to you, is (my dear Friends) That the mo&s;t reputable among you, do, with Speed, endeavour to agree with and purcha&s;e your Lands of the native <HI>Indians</HI> or Inhabitants: Take Example of our wor|thy and honourable late Proprietor, <HI>William Penn</HI>; who, by his wi&s;e and religious Care, in that Relati|on, hath &s;ettled a la&s;ting Peace and Commerce with the Natives, and, through his prudent Manage|ment therein, hath been in&s;trumental to plant in Peace, one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Provinces in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> And who would run the Ri&s;que of the Lives of their Wives and Children, for the &s;paring a little Co&s;t and Pains? I am concerned to lay tho&s;e Things before you, under an uncommon Exerci&s;e of Mind, that your new and flouri&s;hing, little Settle|ment,
<PB N="309" REF="006297_0321_102859B0B510ABC8">
might not be laid wa&s;te, and (if the Provi|dence of the Almighty doth not intervene) &s;ome of the Blood of your&s;elves, Wives or Children, be &s;hed and &s;pilt on the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Con&s;ider you are in the Province of <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> holding what Rights you have under that Go|vernment; and the <HI>Virginians</HI> have made an Agree|ment with the Natives, to go as far as the Moun|tains, but no farther; and you are over and beyond the Mountains, therefore out of that Agreement; by which you lie open to the In&s;ults and Incur&s;ions of the Southern <HI>Indians,</HI> who have de&s;troyed many of the Inhabitants of <HI>Carolina</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> and even now have de&s;troyed more on the like Occa&s;ion [<HI>The</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>going beyond the Bounds of their Agree|ment, were</HI> 11 <HI>of them killed by the</HI> Indians <HI>while we were travelling in</HI> Virginia.]</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> If you believe your&s;elves to be within the Bounds of <HI>William Penn</HI>'s Patent from King <HI>Charles the Second,</HI> which will be hard for you to prove, you being far to the &s;outhward of his Line; yet, if done, that is of no Con&s;ideration with the <HI>Indians,</HI> without a Purcha&s;e of them; except you will go about to convince them by Fire and Sword, contrary to our Principles; and, if that were done, they would ever be implacable Enemies, and the Land would never be enjoyed in Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> Plea&s;e to note, that in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> no new Settlements are made, without an Agreement with the Natives; as Witne&s;s, <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> County, lately &s;ettled; though <HI>that</HI> is far within the Grant of <HI>William Penn</HI>'s Patent from King <HI>Charles the Second</HI>; wherefore you lie open to In&s;urrections of the North|ern as well as Southern <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>And, <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Thus having &s;hewn my Goodwill to you, and to your new little Settlement, that you might &s;it every one under your own &s;hady Tree, where none might make you afraid, and that you
<PB N="310" REF="006297_0322_102859B65D3F5DA0">
might pro&s;per naturally and &s;piritually, you and your Children; and having a little ea&s;ed my Mind of that Weight and Concern (in &s;ome Mea&s;ure) that lay upon me, I, at pre&s;ent, de&s;i&s;t, and &s;ub|&s;cribe, in the Love of our holy Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</P>

<P><PB N="322" REF="006297_0334_102859DBD43270D0">I cannot but note, That the Hand of the Lord God was with us, and I felt his Vi&s;itation as fre&s;h and live|ly as ever;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> for which I was truly thankful, and tho't if I never &s;aw my Habitation again, I was &s;atisfied in this Go&s;pel Call, and religious Vi&s;it; though, being in Years, it was &s;ometimes a little trouble&s;ome to the Fle&s;h; being in the 66th Year of my Age, and &s;tiff in my Limbs from Hurts with many Falls and Brui&s;es; but, as to my Health, I had it better now, than for &s;everal Years pa&s;t; for which I am humbly thankful to Him, in whom we live and have our Being; Glo|ry to his Name, through his dear Son.</P>
<P>Third-day and Fourth-day, vi&s;ited &s;everal Families, and had divers good Opportunities: In one of tho&s;e Meetings, a young Man, named <HI>Jeremiah Martin,</HI> &s;poke a few Words in Prayer; in which Sea&s;on, we were, I think, all broken into Tenderne&s;s; &s;o that in Truth we might &s;ay, That the Power and Spirit of Chri&s;t was with and among us, and his great Name was prai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Fifth-day, being the Week-day-meeting, it was larger than was ever known of a Week-day at that Place; there being divers Friends who came from an I&s;land called <HI>Jos. Vandike</HI>'s, and many Neighbours and &s;ober People, who were very attentive.</P>
<P>Sixth-day, was at &s;everal Peoples Hou&s;es, and had religious Meetings; which we could not well avoid, the People were &s;o loving and de&s;irous to hear what might be &s;poken to them; they being many of them like thir&s;ty Ground, wanting Rain, and our good and gracious Lord gave us cele&s;tial Showers, which were refre&s;hing to us, and thankfully received.</P>
<P>Seventh-day, I went, with &s;everal Friends, to the Hou&s;e of One who, with his Wife, had been at our Meeting on Fifth, day; he kindly invited me to his Hou&s;e; his Name <HI>Blacke</HI>; he and his Wife were

loving; though he had formerly wrote again&s;t Friends, he was now better informed. From his Hou&s;e I went to <HI>Town&s;end Bi&s;hop</HI>'s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tortola.</NOTE> and being many Friends there from another I&s;land, we had a mo&s;t comfortable, ten|der Evening-meeting, in which we offer'd up an E|vening Sacrifice of high Prai&s;es and Thank&s;giving to the holy Name of the Living Eternal God, and his dear Son our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, through the Influence of the Holy Spirit, ONE GOD over all, ble&s;&s;ed forever. And,</P>
<P>On the Fir&s;t-day of the Week, being the 25th of the Month, we had a larger Meeting than ordinary; and, in Expectation of larger Meetings than u&s;ual, the Governor, <HI>John Pickering,</HI> had made &s;everal new Forms to accommodate the People at his own Hou&s;e, which he &s;ent &s;ix Miles on Mens Heads, the Roads not being pa&s;&s;able for Carriage by Carts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This I think worth noting, that their Zeal may be had in Remembrance, and that others may be &s;tirr'd up to a more religious Concern, who will &s;carce go &s;ix Steps to a religious Meeting, or will not go at all. In this Meeting I was concern'd to &s;peak of and &s;et forth the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, which he preached on the <HI>Mount,</HI> contain'd in the 5th, 6th and 7th Chapters of <HI>Mat|thew</HI>; and to pre&s;s the People to come to the Practice of what is there commanded by the great Author of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and to &s;hew that the de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Quakers</HI> had learn'd out of that excellent Sermon much of their Religion, which di&s;plea&s;es many People, and divers of the great Men of the World&punc; and to urge them to regard the Grace of God, which bringeth Sal|vation, and hath appeared to all Men. In this Meet|ing <HI>Dorcas</HI> (the Wife of <HI>John Pickering</HI>) &s;poke to the People in publick Te&s;timony, to which they gave good Attention.</P>
<P>After Meeting we returned by Water from the <HI>Road</HI> Harbour, to <HI>Fat-Hogg-Bay</HI> (where <HI>John Picker|ing</HI>

<P>ON the 2d Day of the Third Week of his being a|mong us, he vi&s;ited &s;ome Friends in the Neigh|bourhood, and likewi&s;e the Man who had treated his Wife &s;o cruelly for coming to Friends Meetings.</P>
<P>On Third-day, he was employed chiefly in Writing to his Family and Friends in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>On Fourth-day, &s;ome Friends from the <HI>Road</HI> came to &s;ee him, which prevented his going out to vi&s;it the Neighbours, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>On Fifth-day Morning, being 29th of the Eighth Month, he found him&s;elf much indi&s;po&s;ed&punc; yet he went to our Week-day-meeting, about a Quarter of a Mile. When the Meeting broke up, he had a hot Fever on him: Doctor <HI>Turnbull</HI> (the chief Phy&s;ician in our I&s;land) thought it proper to take &s;ome Blood

from him, and he being very willing, it was done that Afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tortola.</NOTE> and the Fever abated &s;ometime that Night; and the next Day he walk'd about, and made no Complaint until about Eight o' Clock in the Even|ing; about which Time the Fever return'd, and con|tinued very &s;evere till Fir&s;t-day Morning; when the Doctor advis'd him to take a Vomit, which he de|clin'd that Day, being de&s;irous of attending the Meeting; which was held at my Hou&s;e, and was a large, &s;weet and tender Meeting; in which he &s;poke to us fir&s;t concerning Temptations, and how Chri&s;t was tempted, and how to with&s;tand them; and after|wards on the Parable of the great Supper, and other Subjects; ending his Te&s;timony with the Words of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, I have fought a good Fight, I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e, I have kept the Faith, hence|forth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> Which Words, and mo&s;t Part of this la&s;t Sermon, was delivered in great Brokenne&s;s; from whence I judged that he was &s;en&s;ible that he had not long to live, tho', I believe, he was not afraid to die.</P>
<P>On Second-day Morning, the Fever abated a lit|tle, and he complied with the Doctor's Pre&s;cription of taking a Vomit, which &s;eem'd to have its proper Effect; but that Night the Fever return'd, and con|tinued on him until he dy'd; which was between two and three o' Clock on Fourth-day, Morning, the fourth Day of the Ninth Month, being &s;peechle&s;s a|bout &s;even Hours before.</P>
<P>A general Invitation was given to Friends and others to his Funeral; where three Te&s;timonies were borne, all in great Brokenne&s;s, under a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of our great Lo&s;s. After which he was decently in|terr'd on the Evening of the &s;ame Day, in a Piece of Ground which is &s;ince given to Friends for a Burial Place, and on which a Meeting-hou&s;e is built by

<P>It is &s;aid in the Scriptures, That <HI>the Righteous are taken away, and no Man layeth it to Heart</HI>; but, I hope, it may be truly &s;aid, this was not the Ca&s;e at this Time; for Friends, in general, much lamented their great Lo&s;s, in being &s;o &s;oon deprived of &s;o in&s;truc|tive a Friend and Elder, who&s;e Care over us was very great; and who, by his loving and exemplary Life, and Tenderne&s;s to People of all Ranks and Profe&s;&s;ions, engag'd the Love and Re&s;pect of mo&s;t of the People in the I&s;land.

<HEAD><HI>GOD</HI>'s Great Love to <HI>MANKIND,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been concerned for the Good and Welfare of the Children of Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1697.</NOTE> in my youthful Days, and ta&s;ted of the infi|nite Love of God, in, and through his dear Son, the holy Lamb Je&s;us, who laid down his Life for the Sins of the World; and, in my tender Years, reaped great Benefit, through Faith in, and Obedience unto, him: For, truly, I have found, by &s;ufficient Experience, that one without the other <HI>(to wit)</HI> Faith without Works, will not an&s;wer the End of the great Love of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, our Lord, in that he offer'd him&s;elf a Sacrifice for all Mankind; not for People to live in Sin, but to take away the Sin of the World: In a Word, <HI>Faith, without Works, is dead,</HI> James ii. 20. For my Part, I found it &s;o, and &s;o mu&s;t all true Believers in the Son of God.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t he fir&s;t loved us, and paid that Debt for us, that, of our&s;elves, we were not able to do. Oh his infinite Love! it hath oftentimes melted my Soul into Tenderne&s;s. Methinks it is Abundance of Pity, that ever the Sons of Men &s;hould requite Evil for Good, or Di&s;obedience, for &s;uch gracious Obedience: I would to God, that all Believers in Chri&s;t, would live in that Fear of God, and that Love to Chri&s;t, that keepeth the Heart clean; becau&s;e nothing unclean can enter the Kingdom of Heaven. I don't mean a &s;lavi&s;h Fear; but Fear, that is wrought by Love: For them
<PB N="332" REF="006297_0343_102859F6B4B23430">
that love the Lord, the Great, Everla&s;ting God, will fear to offend Him.</P>
<P>This is the Matter that chiefly beareth Stre&s;s on my Mind, at this Time, The Nece&s;&s;ity of Love to God, and Chri&s;t, and one another: <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive, the Things that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prepared for them that love Him,</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 9. For thy Part, I can't pretend to tell thee, O Man! to the Full; but only a little to hint at it: It is, <HI>Joy un&s;peakable, and full of Glory:</HI> But then we mu&s;t love Him, &s;o as to keep His Commandments. This is the Work that I am very earne&s;t in pre&s;&s;ing People to; whether Youth, or Aged: It is not too &s;oon for the Young, neither too late for the Aged, to begin this Work of Obedi|ence, through Faith, and Love to God and Chri&s;t, if His Spirit is reproving or &s;triving in them. But it is more honourable and acceptable, for a Man to give up the Strength of his Days to &s;erve the Lord, and to remem|ber his Creator in the Days of his Youth, before Sin is too much rooted and grown in Man; for then it will be much more Labour, to get the Root of Un|righteou&s;ne&s;s plucked up.</P>
<P>So that in that Ability, which God hath given me, I would endeavour to &s;tir up all to &s;erve Him, and to be in good Earne&s;t, and not to put the Day of God, even the Mighty Jehovah, a-far off; but to love the Lord unfeignedly, and with true Obedience; &s;ince it is that Sacrifice, that is only acceptable to God; that is to &s;ay, To love Him in Deed, and in Truth, more than in Word, and with Tongue: For again&s;t &s;uch a People, the Lord, by his Servant, complain'd, in old Time; <HI>They, &s;aith the Lord, draw nigh to me with their Mouths, and with their Lips do honour me:</HI> But, Oh! their great Mi&s;ery was, their Hearts were far from Him; they did not love Him with their whole Hearts; that was their great Fault: This Thing is al|&s;o a great Evil in the Sight of the Great God, in this
<PB N="333" REF="006297_0344_102859FAD5A0F4F0">
our Age; and it is too frequent in <HI>England,</HI> the Land of my Nativity, as al&s;o in other I&s;lands, and Places, beyond the Sea. What Lamentation &s;hall be taken up, for &s;uch as do &s;o mock the Lord, the Great God of Love? Surely he will render Vengeance, as in Flames of Fire, upon all the Wicked, and Ungodly, and tho&s;e that forget Him. 'Tis not by Saying, but by Doing, that we are ju&s;tified, through Faith in Chri&s;t: Not he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, Lord, Lord, only; but he that doth his Will al&s;o, &s;hall enter the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now the Will of God, and Chri&s;t his Son, is, That we &s;hould love Him above all; and in loving Him, we &s;hall love one another; for Chri&s;t &s;aw the great Need there was of loving God above all, and al&s;o of loving one another; therefore he an&s;wered thus to him that a&s;ked him, Which was the greate&s;t Com|mandment &mdash;<HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind,</HI> Mat. xxii. 37.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>is the fir&s;t and great Commandment; and the Second is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf: On the&s;e two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets,</HI> Ver&s;es 38, 39, and 40.</P>
<P>Now if the&s;e two great Commandments were obey|ed, it would an&s;wer God's great Love to us, in &s;end|ing his Son to ble&s;s us, O! the Glory of God, how it would &s;hine! it would make the young Men, as Vali|ants of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and the old Men, as Captains of Thou|&s;ands; then Chri&s;t would reign gloriou&s;ly indeed, in the Hearts of the Children of Men; here the Lamb and his Followers (that walk in the Light, and that Commandment, that burns as a Lamp) would get the Victory over the Devil, and his Followers: But, on the contrary, this is the great Error of Mankind, they talk of God, and Chri&s;t, in Words; but deny Him in Works: Nay, &s;ome will not &s;tick to &s;ay, It is im|po&s;&s;ible to keep the Commands of Chri&s;t. It is
<PB N="334" REF="006297_0345_102859FF1FD52B80">
too commonly &s;poken, and al&s;o believed, That there is no Perfection on this Side the Grave, contrary to the Saying of Chri&s;t, <HI>Be ye perfect, even as your Fa|ther&punc; which is i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> perfect,</HI> Mat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 48. Yet, &s;ay they, it is impo&s;&s;ible; which is as much as to &s;ay, Chri&s;t is a hard Ma&s;ter, in commanding what cannot be done, con&s;equently, out of their own Mouths they will be condemned: for Chri&s;t is not a hard Ma&s;ter. I te&s;tify again&s;t all &s;uch unholy and imperfect Belie|vers, in &s;olid Fear before the Lord; but according to &s;uch People's Faith, and Belief, he mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> needs be hard. O that People would but &s;o love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and his dear Son, as to &s;trive to do his Commands; for it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould obey, if they do neither be|lieve, nor endeavour: But let &s;uch know, That <HI>ma|ny &s;hall &s;trive, and &s;hall not enter</HI>; much le&s;s, <HI>enter,</HI> if they do not <HI>&s;trive:</HI> But we mu&s;t, of Nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>&s;trive,</HI> in Obedience to his Will, and by his A&s;&s;i&s;tance (not in our own natural Will) <HI>to enter in at the &s;trait Gate:</HI> Man would enter in with all his plea&s;ant Things, and in all his Bravery, and Gallantry; but God's Will is, That he &s;hould be brought low, that he might exalt him. O! this Self, it is a great Enemy to Mankind.</P>
<P>My intention is, to awaken People out of the Sleep of Sin, which is Death; and to &s;tir them up to Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and Love to the Lord, and their Neigh|bour, even with their whole Heart: This is what my Heart breathes to, and &s;upplicates, the Lord of Hea|ven for; Then would the End of my Labour, in his Love, be an&s;wered; for great is the Love of God, in &s;ending his Son, and, al&s;o, in &s;ending his Servants, and &s;tirring them up, to rouze People out of the Sleep of Security, that they might &s;ee the Danger they are in, and how near they lie to the Brink of the Pit of Burning. O! that People would but &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider that which is &s;hewed and told them in the Love of the Lord. O that it might be laid to Heart. How|ever, whether they will hear, or forbear, God will be
<PB N="335" REF="006297_0346_10285A00A673EAF8">
clear, and his Servants al&s;o will be clear. But if we not only hear, but al&s;o obey, that Peace, which pa&s;|&s;eth the Under&s;tanding of Men (that our Lord giveth to his Followers) will be our Portion, and the Lot of our Inheritance forever. But this is on Condition of our Obedience, and keeping the Commands of God: <HI>If ye love me, keep my Commandments</HI> (John xiv. 15.) &s;aith the Lord. So, if People live in Saying, and not in Doing, in Profe&s;&s;ing, and Confe&s;&s;ing, yet &s;till living in Pride, and High-mindedne&s;s, and in Sin, it is appa|rent, they do not love Chri&s;t Je&s;us (according to his own Words) neither doth he ju&s;tify them; 'tis only the Doers that he will ju&s;tify. The Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;ays, <HI>If a Man &s;ays, he loves God, and yet hateth his Brother, he is a Liar,</HI> 1 John iv. 20. and, by plain Scripture Te&s;timony, &s;uch are not of God: Moreover, if he &s;ays, He loves Chri&s;t, yet doth not his Sayings, he is al&s;o a Liar, and the Truth is not in him, or, Chri&s;t is not in him; who &s;aid, <HI>I am the Truth</HI>; and thus Man becomes reprobated; for <HI>Paul,</HI> writing to the Bre|thren, &s;aith, <HI>Examine your&s;elves, whether you be in the Faith, prove your own&s;elves; know ye not, your own|&s;elves, how that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in you, except ye be Re|probates,</HI> 2 Cor. xiii. 5. Which Indwelling of Chri&s;t, is a great My&s;tery to many; although Chri&s;t within (which the Apo&s;tles preached) was the Hope of the Saints Glory, <HI>Col.</HI> i. 27. And, Oh! how earne&s;t was Chri&s;t in Prayer to his Father, That his Followers may be one in Him, and that they might be united to|gether in one, <HI>John</HI> xvii. Such was the Love of Chri&s;t to his Church; now, what remains on the Church's Part, &s;ince Chri&s;t has done his Part, &s;urely it is, that we love him again; for, &s;aith <HI>John, He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is Love,</HI> 1 John iv. 8. They that dwell in Enmity, are not the Children of God; but the Children of Satan; who always hated the Appearance of Chri&s;t, the Light of the World; and yet &s;tirreth up tho&s;e that are led by his dark Spirit,
<PB N="336" REF="006297_0347_10285A022C3225E0">
to war again&s;t Him, and his Seed, in his Children; who &s;aid, <HI>I am the Light of the World.</HI></P>
<P>But indeed it is as Chri&s;t hath &s;aid, <HI>Men love Dark|ne&s;s rather than Light</HI>; and how &s;trange is it, &s;eeing the one is &s;o glorious, and the other &s;o mi&s;erable? But the Rea&s;on is, as Chri&s;t hath &s;hewed, <HI>becau&s;e their Deeds are evil,</HI> John iii. 19. That is indeed the very Cau&s;e; for if their Deeds were good, they would love the Light which is Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Lord of Life and Glory; and bring their Deeds to him, that he might judge them; who will give righteous Judg|ment to every Man according to his Works, <HI>John</HI> v. 29. The Righteous will have their Portion in the Re|&s;urrection of Life, Joy and Peace, in the Holy Gho&s;t; but the Wicked in the Re&s;urrection of Damnation. Oh! that I might be in&s;trumental in the Hand of the Lord, to open the Eyes of &s;ome that are &s;piritually blind, that they might &s;ee the Splendor, the Beauty, and the great Glory, of the dear Son of God, that mo&s;t ex|cellent Light which God hath prepared, according to good old <HI>Simeon</HI>'s Te&s;timony of him, <HI>Thou ha&s;t</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>prepared him a Light to enlighten the Gentiles, and to be the Glory of thy People I&s;rael,</HI> Luke iii. 32.

Chri&s;t's Love was unfeigned to his Di&s;ciples, nay, to all the World in general; for what greater Love can there be, than for a Man to lay down his Life for his Friend; and he not only laid down his Life for his Friends, but for his Enemies al&s;o, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 10. So that his Love was great and un|feigned: We ought with the &s;ame Love to love him again, &s;ince that he loved us fir&s;t; and this cannot be without Obedience to his Commands. Thus undoubtedly we &s;hould with true Love love him, and one another: This Love is exceeding precious, it thinks no Evil, and we may be &s;ure, will not do any willingly or knowingly. If a Man &s;eeth his Neighbour or Brother in that which is not Right, he prayeth to the Lord to help him, and tenderly admoni&s;heth him; yea, if having this Love he woundeth, his Wounds are faithful, for <HI>faithful are the Wounds of a Friend, Prov.</HI> xxv. 6.

O the Love that is rai&s;ed in them that love the Lord above all, it is great to the Sons and Daughters of Men; it doth wonderful Things; it is valiant for God; it overcomes its Enemies: It is not overcome with Evil, but it often overcomes Evil with Good: It &s;miteth Sin in the Gate (that is, in its fir&s;t Appearance) before it be

<P><HI>Paul,</HI> the Apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t, did not after his Con|ver&s;ion hate his Neighbour, nor was he in Enmity with them; indeed when he was <HI>Saul,</HI> he did op|pre&s;s and injure his neare&s;t Neighbours and chiefe&s;t Friends, for that blind Zeal was part of that Body of Sin and Death that was upon him, and from which, by the Help of Chri&s;t's Grace, he was deli|vered, and came to love his Enemies; and for their Good hazarded his Life: And for his Love to Chri&s;t laid it down, as many holy Martyrs have done &s;ince his Time.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Some People are too apt to judge one ano|ther, and to &s;peak Evil of Things they know not, except by Report and Suppo&s;ition, which too often lets in Enmity, and is not according to the Mind of Chri&s;t, but is a Snare of the Enemy of Man's Salvati|on. Surely if People were &s;en&s;ible thereof, they would not &s;o hardly cen&s;ure one another: For indeed we ought to be well &s;atisfied before we give Judgment, and then it ought to be in Love, and not in Enmity. It is better to &s;uffer, than to cen&s;ure, or to be judged, than to Judge.&mdash;<HI>Judge not, that ye be not judged,</HI> Matt. vii. 1.&mdash;&s;aid the Judge of Heaven and Earth. But People are too much po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Uncharitablene&s;s and Revenge one towards another, and are not &s;o rea|dy to forgive one another their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as the Al|mighty is to forgive them: Tho' to forgive one a|nother their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, be every Chri&s;tian's Duty, and without which, we cannot ju&s;tly expect God to for|give us our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as Chri&s;t Taught, <HI>Matt.</HI> vi. 14, 15.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Per&s;ecution for Righteou&s;ne&s;s Sake, al&s;o is another great Branch of that corrupt Tree, which ne|ver did, and never will bring forth good Fruit, but mu&s;t be cut down by the Ax of God's Power, which is laid to the Root of every corrupt Tree, in order to cut it down; and the Lord will burn it with un|quenchable Fire.

The Judgment of Man is terrible to the Rebellious, how much more if Men rebel again&s;t God, our Saviour, will his Judgment be ju&s;t and dreadful, as he hath not only Power to kill the Body, but can afterwards ca&s;t the Soul into Hell?

deep Sen&s;e of this great Sin, it hath been, and is of great Moment, and is a great Concern on my Mind: Vengeance from Heaven is, and will be the Portion of all &s;uch, that thus violate the Mind and Will of God. Judgment, Judgment is the Lot and Inheritance of all the Wicked, who remain and live in Wickedne&s;s. Altho' the Lord is &s;low to Anger, and of Great Lov|ing-Kindne&s;s, and his Mercy endureth for ever, to them that truly repent of Evil, and do that which is Good: Yet he has al&s;o prepared Weeping, Wailing, and Gna&s;hing of Teeth, for them that continually live in Sin.

And by this Frame of Drunkenne&s;s, Men are often fitted for any Bu&s;ine&s;s that their Ma&s;ter the Devil may call them to: So that this great Sin ought to be &s;trictly watched again&s;t. Surely if Men had any good De&s;ires in their Hearts, or any Love to God, they would refrain from &s;uch great Wickedne&s;s. I admire how People can expect Mercy from God, or the Interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, when they are piercing his Sides, and putting of him to open Shame: For tho&s;e that are &s;inning again&s;t him, are piercing of him. How can &s;uch expect He will

Now &s;uppo&s;e a Man &s;tood condemn'd before a Judge, and that at the Judge's right Hand there &s;at one who had Power in his Hand, and this poor condemn'd Per&s;on, hopes he will interceed for him; and yet this poor Wretch has come to him as before mentioned. What Grounds can he have, to hope for Interce&s;&s;ion, Clemency or Leni|ty, while he believes he can do no otherwi&s;e than &s;in again&s;t him all his Days? For my part, I think his Faith, Hope and Belief, is but vain; without any Rea|&s;on or Ground. But he that loveth Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Lord of Life and Glory, &s;o as to keep his Com|mandments, the Lord will love him, and interceed for him, and make him&s;elf known unto him; accord|ing to his Words, which he &s;pake, <HI>He that hath my Commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, &s;hall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and manife&s;t my&s;elf unto him,</HI> John xiv. 21.</P>

How can any be &s;o hard-hearted, to &s;ee his Brother's or his Neighbour's Poverty, and not admini&s;ter of his Ability to the Needful's Nece&s;&s;ity? But &s;ays the covetous or mi|&s;erable Man, I have Children, or a Family to take care of: But too often Covetou&s;ne&s;s brings a Cur&s;e, and not a Ble&s;&s;ing, upon Family and Children al&s;o.

Perhaps one that is covetous may &s;ay, that Charity begins at Home. But let him remember, that if it doth begin there, the Con&s;equence mo&s;t commonly is very bad, when it ends there.

<HEAD>FRUITS OF DIVINE MEDITATION At SEA, in the Year 1699.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man that walketh not in the Coun&s;el of the Ungodly, nor &s;tandeth in the Way of Sinners, nor &s;it|teth in the Seat of the Scornful; but his Delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he medi|tate Day and Night,</P>
<BIBL>P&s;alm i.</BIBL>
<P>Lay up for your&s;elves Trea&s;ure in Heaven,</P>
<BIBL>Mat. vi. 20.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. IT is good for Man, who&s;e Breath is in his No|&s;trils, to think upon his Maker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1699.</NOTE> as much as in him lieth, both Night and Day;</P>
<P N="2">2. Who is the Fountain of all Mens Happi|ne&s;s, and the Ocean of their Bli&s;s; not only in this World, but in that which is to come; even to all E|ternity.</P>
<P N="3">3. How &s;weet is that Meditation, that is on the So|vereign Lord of Heaven, and on the Prince of ever|la&s;ting Glory?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="350" REF="006297_0361_10285A3201A14838">4. No earthly Thing is to be compared with it; all the Glory, all the Pomp, and Vanity, of this fa|ding, tran&s;itory World, is not comparable with it: Divine and inward Contemplation upon God, is no le&s;s than Heaven upon Earth to the Soul.</P>
<P N="5">5. This mine Eye hath &s;een; for which I humbly bow before the great Lord of all; who&s;e Goodne&s;s to Man cannot fully be &s;et forth, neither by the mo&s;t excel|lent Orator, nor with a ready Writer's Pen.</P>
<P N="6">6. God delighteth in tho&s;e that are intent in looking unto Him; and it is Man's Duty to look to him, o|ver all vi&s;ible Things.</P>
<P N="7">7. How profitable, and greatly advantageous, it is to the Soul, to be inward with God. Oh! it is alto|gether admirable.</P>
<P N="8">8. The un&s;peakable Trea&s;ures of Life, and of Wi&s;|dom, are to be found in inward Meditation, and holy Contemplation, on God.</P>
<P N="9">9. When a Man, in this Sort, is delighting him|&s;elf with his Maker, and advi&s;ing with Him, he can want no good Thing. In Days of old God was, now is, and ever will be, found by Man, in this in|ward Concern of the Soul.</P>
<P N="10">10. A Man in this State, will always curb high Thoughts of Self, as being in the Pre&s;ence of the Al|mighty; for then he is truly &s;en&s;ible of his Pre&s;ence: Who is it that will vaunt, or carry him&s;elf loftily, when God is pre&s;ent, and he con&s;iders it.</P>
<P N="11">11. Indeed the Pre&s;ence of the Almighty is every where, but many have lo&s;t the Sen&s;e thereof, for want of inward Thoughts on God, and &s;tudious Contem|plation on the King of Heaven, who&s;e Sovereignty is &s;weet over the Works of his Hands;</P>
<P N="12">12. He is full of Grace, and full of Truth, full of Mercy, and full of Ju&s;tice: His Law is Light, and his Commands are as burning Lamps; in a Word, he is full of hea|venly Maje&s;ty, and Divine Power, &s;o that no Cha|racters can &s;et forth the Fulne&s;s of God.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="351" REF="006297_0362_10285A3524B4E960">13. Oh! that Man were rightly &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Things, it would cau&s;e him, with an humble Heart, to implore the Maje&s;ty of Heaven for his Favour, and petition Him for the Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Grace, to do his holy and heavenly Will.</P>
<P N="14">14. Man would then &s;ee his own Weakne&s;s and Po|verty, and how unable he is to do, or work, any good Thing of him&s;elf, without the Help of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P N="15">15. Which Gift God, through Chri&s;t, giveth to that Soul which is inward in its Thoughts upon God; who&s;e Wi&s;dom and Power is pa&s;t finding out, unle&s;s in this Frame of Mind the Lord reveals it.</P>
<P N="16">16. But worldly Thoughts, and vain Cogitations, hinder the Mind from being with God, the Fountain of all Good.</P>
<P N="17">17. Evil Works, or Words, al&s;o &s;tupify the Mind, and deaden the mo&s;t noble Part of Man, &s;o that &s;la|vi&s;h Fear, in&s;tead of that Fear which is mix'd with true Love and Honour, is begotten in the Heart.</P>
<P N="18">18. All Things of any evil Tendency entertain'd in the Soul, are an Ob&s;truction to its Duty to God.</P>
<P N="19">19. Who would but lay up Trea&s;ure in Heaven, that the Heart might al&s;o be there? And what Trea|&s;ure like that in Heaven, or what Place &s;o fit to lay it in as that is?</P>
<P N="20">20. If a Man did but, with con&s;iderate Thoughts, weigh in his Mind the Shortne&s;s and Uncertainty of Time in this Life, and the boundle&s;s Ocean of Eterni|ty; with a Life of Bli&s;s and Glory, or el&s;e of Woe and Mi&s;ery, that will never end;</P>
<P N="21">21. Without his Heart be harder than a flinty Rock, it would lead him into Tenderne&s;s, &s;erious Thoughts on the Name of God, and into Humiliation.</P>
<P N="22">22. Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Anointed of God; was found greatly in Humiliation; even he who &s;aid, <HI>Learn of me, and follow me, who am meek, and low in Heart.</HI>
<PB N="352" REF="006297_0363_10285A36AAE191D0">
God calls for Humility of all Men. He behold the Proud, and Scornful, afar off.</P>
<P N="23">23. Every proud and exalted Thought God will bring to Judgment, and likewi&s;e &s;uch Words and Actions.</P>
<P N="24">24. And, indeed, the Thing acted, or done, mu&s;t fir&s;t be conceived, or thought, before it be brought forth; for <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth &s;peaketh,</HI> and the Man acteth.</P>
<P N="25">25. Therefore to have the Thoughts of the Heart on God, and to contemplate on Heaven, and heaven|ly Things, is truly excellent.</P>
<P N="26">26. And although this incumbent Duty of Man is &s;o a|ver&s;e to him, in his natural State; yet it is mo&s;t ea&s;y, &s;weet, and plea&s;ant, to the Soul, when the Mind is bent after, and set on, heavenly Things.</P>
<P N="27">27. And that which is &s;till more admirable is, that God is the alone Comfort, Joy, Helper, Leader, and Conducter, of &s;uch a Soul.</P>
<P N="28">28. But, Oh! the Thoughts of Man are too much taken up with earthly and peri&s;hing Things, being content with the Shadow, or Shell, of Divine Con|templation, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true Religion; &s;o that too few are earne&s;tly &s;eeking the Sub&s;tance thereof.</P>
<P N="29">29. That the noble Creature Man, which God hath made but a little lower than the Angels, and given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Power over tho&s;e Creatures that are more ignoble that, him&s;elf, &s;hould &s;o degenerate from his Maker, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fix his Thoughts on terre&s;trial Things, is admirable to Heaven-born Souls, who&s;e God is the Lord.</P>
<P N="30">30. Which Way can the Soul look, or turn it&s;elf, but that it mu&s;t needs &s;ee the Glory of the God of Heaven, unle&s;s the God of this World hath blinded the Eye of the Mind.</P>
<P N="31">31. Look upwards, and we may behold the Brightne&s;s of his Glory in the Firmament, and the
<PB N="353" REF="006297_0364_10285A386280E6A8">
Workman&s;hip of his Hands in the Sun, Moon, and Stars:</P>
<P N="32">32. Or if we look on the Earth, or in the Sea, we may &s;ee his great Wonders; and if, in Sincerity, we behold the heavenly Works of his Hands, with an Eye of Faith, Oh! how can it do any le&s;s but draw deep Con&s;iderations of the Omnipotence of God.</P>
<P N="33">33. Thus, beholding the Works of God, and look|ing on his Works of old, and the noble Acts which he hath done in former Times, will rai&s;e holy De&s;ires to be with Him, and to be in his Pre&s;ence, when Time to us, in this World, &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P N="34">34. It will al&s;o beget a loving Fear of the Lord in the Soul, le&s;t that it &s;hould offend Him.</P>
<P N="35">35. Such a Soul will be inwardly concern'd before the Lord, and will &s;eek Him with unwearied Travel of Spirit.</P>
<P N="36">36. After this Manner will that Soul cry to God, in the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication, that is travel|ling towards the City, who&s;e Builder, and Maker, is God;</P>
<P N="37">37. Lord, I am poor, do thou make me rich; I am needy, O! &s;trengthen me, even me, O my hea|venly Father! for I am the lea&s;t of many: O, my Saviour, have Mercy upon me!</P>
<P N="38">38. Thou &s;ee&s;t my Weakne&s;s, and knowe&s;t my Want, and how unable I am, of my&s;elf to do thy Will; give me Grace, or el&s;e I die; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e by the Power, and by the Spirit of thy Son, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e I peri&s;h forever.</P>
<P N="39">39. Lord, I believe; my Faith is in thee, and in the Power of thine Anointed, help mine Unbelief, for Je&s;us' Sake, I humbly pray thee, O thou great Crea|tor of the Children of Men!</P>
<P N="40">40. O! Great, Eternal God, thou knowe&s;t my &s;ecret De&s;ires, and the private Devotion of my Heart.</P>
<P N="41"><PB N="354" REF="006297_0365_10285A3D11273C40">41. My Sighing and Tears are after thee, O thou Beloved of my Soul!</P>
<P N="42">42. All the Profit and Plea&s;ure that is in this World is Nothing, and le&s;s than Nothing, in Compari&s;on of Thee, and the Enjoyment of thy Pre&s;ence, O thou Lord of Life and Glory.</P>
<P N="43">43. Thou Great Creator of all Things, from whom all Things have their Being, &s;end forth the Spirit of thy Son into my Heart, whereby, with Acceptance, I may cry, <HI>Abba Father.</HI></P>
<P N="44">44. O! Holy Father, let me feel thy Power, that I may be able to make War in thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s, a|gain&s;t the Enemy of my poor Soul.</P>
<P N="45">45. Great, Eternal God, give me Wi&s;dom to walk uprightly before thee, and before the Children of Men: O that my Soul may &s;eek after it forever!</P>
<P N="46">46. With which, O Lord, fill my earthen Ve&s;&s;el, for Je&s;us' Sake, that I may be gentle, and ea&s;y to be entreated to do thy Will, &s;o that I may never rebel a|gain&s;t thee.</P>
<P N="47">47. Lord, do not tarry long from me; for if thou hides thy Face, I am troubled; or when the Curtain is drawn between me and my Maker, then my Spirit within me langui&s;heth.</P>
<P N="48">48. Therefore, O Lord, ari&s;e, and the Thoughts that are at Enmity with thee, &s;hall be &s;cattered from my Soul:</P>

<P N="50">50. And, Holy Father, as thou ha&s;t begotten tho&s;e Thoughts and De&s;ires in my Soul, &s;o do for ma|ny more of the Sons and Daughters of Men.</P>
<P N="51">51. Such a Soul, who&s;e Thoughts and Meditations are on this Wi&s;e, Almighty God never did, and never will, reject, or ca&s;t off.</P>
<P N="52">52. Heaven and Earth may pa&s;s away, but the Mercy and Goodne&s;s of the Lord God of Heaven and

<P N="53">53. The holy Men of God, and the Faithful in Ages pa&s;t, bore Te&s;timony to the&s;e Truths.</P>

<P>IT is a Thing truly excellent for Mortals to love,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1709.</NOTE> &s;erve, and fear Him that made them, and gave unto all Life and Being: And to begin this Work betimes, is very advantageous to the never dy|ing Soul. It is al&s;o an indi&s;pen&s;able Duty, which is incumbent upon every one, Male and Female; and who|ever is found in the Neglect thereof, will certainly have Cau&s;e dearly to repent it, and unle&s;s they do repent before they go hence, and &s;ee Man no more, will be mi&s;erable to all Eternity.

could not be clear (as I thought) in the Sight of God, without laying of it before Men and Women.</P>
<P>Now, that we may &s;o do, con&s;ider, Truth com|mands us, Rea&s;on per&s;uades us, and Example is very powerful and inviting. Oh! that the Children of Men would be wi&s;e to Salvation, and embrace the Love of God in his dear and well-beloved Son, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 14.6.</NOTE> who him&s;elf &s;aid, <HI>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</HI> Oh! &s;urely here is a Three-fold Cord, (<HI>i. e.</HI> Truth, Rea&s;on and Example,) which is not ea&s;ily broken: God Almighty grant (for Chri&s;t's &s;ake) that by it &s;ome poor Soul might be drawn to him even now in their tender Years: <HI>To Day, to Day</HI>&punc; if any will hear the <HI>Voice of the Lord,</HI> Oh! Let them not harden their Hearts; for that is provoking to him that made us. How know we whether he, who made the Heavens, will be plea&s;ed to give us a|nother Hour? How know we, but that after this Day we may never open our Eyes, till we open them in Eternity? Oh Eternity, Eternity, that boundle&s;s Ocean! who can fathom tho&s;e Words, <HI>for Ever and Ever?</HI> What will this World, and all its Glories and Vanities &s;ignify, or avail to poor Souls, when rowling from Side to Side on a Dying-bed.</P>
<P>It will therefore be well for both Old and Young to note this:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Old, becau&s;e it is not likely they &s;hould have many Days, according to the Cour&s;e of Nature, and a common Proverb, i. e. <HI>The Young</HI> (may live, and they) <HI>may die, but the Old mu&s;t die.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Young, becau&s;e they know not but they may die To-morrow.</P>
<P>In the great and notable Day of the mo&s;t High, Oh! then, then, heavenly Things will be found &s;erious and &s;olid Truths, and not Toys and Trifles, nor in|different Things; when <HI>He &s;hall come as in Flames of Fire, to render Vengeance</HI> (which is only his) <HI>upon all the Workers of Iniquity, and &s;hall come to judge the

<P>Wherefore, let me prevail with &s;ome poor Souls, now in time, to lay the Truth to Heart, and to be found in the Work of God in their Day: That &s;o for their Pains here, they may receive their Penny hereafter; and that enlivening, that quickening An&s;wer of <HI>Well-doing,</HI> may be their Portion, and the Lot (the glorious Lot) of their Inheritance: <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matt.</HI> 25.21, 23, 34.</NOTE> <HI>Well done, good and faithful Servant: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI> Oh powerful Voice, and Heart-ravi&s;hing Sentence!

Oh! this divine Favour and Grace, wherewith the mo&s;t High will favour tho&s;e that love Him, and faithfully &s;erve Him, in this his great and notable Day, will far exceed the Favour of Kings and Princes: For tho&s;e that get the latter, can only be happy (or &s;o accounted) in this World, which is but momentary; and tho&s;e who are living and &s;en&s;ible Witne&s;&s;es of the former, are certainly happy, even in this World (although Men may not &s;ee it) and like|wi&s;e everla&s;tingly happy in that World which is to come.

His Father and Mo|ther call'd him, and bid him go; he does it, without any Replies to the contrary; not like &s;ome of the Youth of this Age.

to &s;et up for him&s;elf in the World, his Mind was not high, neither &s;ought he after great Things; notwith&s;tanding which, the Almighty gave him in A|bundance. So onwards he went, and came to <HI>Laban,</HI> and became his Servant. I could wi&s;h that all young People, that are Servants, would follow his Steps in Faithfulne&s;s; then might they be a Ble&s;&s;ing to their Ma&s;ters, as he was to his. I ever ob&s;erved in my Travels (having travelled much in divers Nations, and made many Ob&s;ervations) that Almighty God hath greatly ble&s;&s;ed obedient, indu&s;trious Children and Ser|vants: Which Ob&s;ervation, I hope, will be of good U&s;e to the World, if well con&s;ider'd. And on the o|ther Hand, I have taken Notice of the contrary, and have perfectly under&s;tood, that God's Hand hath been manife&s;tly again&s;t tho&s;e that have been di&s;obedient, and ill-natured, and idle; which may be an u&s;eful Caution to all. Now the Lord ble&s;&s;ed the good Ser|vice, and faithful Indu&s;try, of this his Servant with great Increa&s;e; as al&s;o with many Children, for whom he was concerned as a tender Father, even to the very la&s;t: And (like a pious and godly Father) pray'd to the Lord for their Pre&s;ervation; and was zealou&s;ly concerned to clean&s;e his Family from Super&s;tition and Idolatry; and calls them to go up to <HI>Bethel,</HI> or the Hou&s;e of God, Oh! that all Heads of Families, would be concern'd for their Po&s;terity, and &s;eek God, and the Things of his Kingdom, for their Children and Servants, more than the Things of this World; there being too much Care for the one, and too little for the other, generally &s;peaking: So that there is Need of this Caution. Now this good Man was not only con|cerned for his Family in his Life, but ever at his Death al&s;o&punc; For he, waiting for the Salvation of God, and being &s;en&s;ible of it, very livingly and &s;en&s;ibly ble&s;|&s;ed his Seed, and was opened in Faith to &s;peak exactly to each of their States and Conditions. I refer to the Hi&s;tory of it in Holy Scripture, the which I believe will

be affecting to pious Minds. Oh! what a Race he left behind! All his twelve Sons were Patriarchs, and great Fathers of many People, who were highly fa|voured of God, and had been to this Day, had they walk'd in the Steps of their Fathers <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob:</HI> From whom came many valiant and noble Men, of and for God; as <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Sa|muel, David, Solomon, Jo&s;iah, Elijah</HI> and <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>; al&s;o the Holy Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Star,</HI> and <HI>Sun of Rihgteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Holy JESUS, whom the degenerate Offspring of good old <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;lew, and hanged on a Tree: Al&s;o the holy Apo&s;tles, were great Examples of Virtue: Al&s;o the ble&s;&s;ed Martyrs, and many modern good Men, might be brought in for inviting Examples, to &s;tir up the Minds of Men and Women, to &s;erve, love, and fol|low the Lord, and to believe in Him, and in his dear Son, and in the Appearance of his Grace working in the Soul, in order to the convincing and converting of it.</P>
<P>To be particular in all the above In&s;tances, would &s;well this far beyond what is intended; and con&s;ider|ing the many and large Volumes that are in the World, though a large Door opened before me, yet am now willing to conclude, and recommend the <HI>Work,</HI> with the <HI>Reader,</HI> to the Grace of God, in and through his dear Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us, our great Example: To whom, with the Father, through the Divine Spirit, be Glory for ever.</P>

<P>IT being a known Principle of the People called <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> that the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t ought to be preached freely by his Mini&s;ters; yet, notwith&s;tanding, divers People, of divers Per&s;wa&s;ions, either for want of Charity, or through Prejudice, or wrong Information,

or all three, do &s;ay, or believe, that the Quakers Mini&s;ters or Teachers are paid for their Preaching; I do po&s;itively de|clare to the World, that it is an utter Fal&s;hood and Scandal upon the &s;aid People: For we cannot in good Con&s;cience make a Trade of our holy Calling, neither is the Word of God to be bought or &s;old for outward Gain; witne&s;s the Apo&s;tle's An&s;wer to <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> Acts <HI>viii. 18, 20.</HI> And if we cannot pay our own, pray how can we pay o|thers, and be clear of Guilt, or have the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience, we believing it to be Evil? And every Body that knows the Holy Scriptures, knows that <HI>what is not of Faith is Sin</HI>; and yet our Adver&s;aries would have us commit this Sin; and if we will not do it willingly, they will force it from us by the Power of the Magi&s;trates, although the Holy Scriptures and Rea&s;on is clearly again&s;t them, as is plainly manife&s;ted in the en&s;uing little Tract.</P>
<P>And as for my Part, I have travelled many Thou&s;ands of Miles, and preached the Go&s;pel among the &s;aid People many Years&punc; as Thou&s;ands of them can witne&s;s, and never received my Con&s;ideration therefor, neither directly nor in|directly; neither do I reckon they are beholden to me for &s;o doing, for <HI>a Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon me,</HI> and <HI>woe is me if I preach not the Go&s;pel</HI>; neither do I boa&s;t, for I have done but my Duty, and in that Sen&s;e am but an unprofita|ble Servant, according as Chri&s;t taught, for all the Pro|fit is of Chri&s;t. And if Occa&s;ion were, there are many other Mini&s;ters among the &s;aid People, could bear the like Te&s;timony.</P>

<Q>That he thinks that there is &s;ufficient Matter of Conviction in the Texts and Arguments improved.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> But every &s;incere Soul, when they come to &s;ee the Texts them&s;elves, will have Cau&s;e to think to the contrary; for had they been fairly produced, they would have &s;aved the Labour of a further Reply, they being far from countenancing any forced Maintenance to Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters. And as for his Arguments im|proved, they &s;mell &s;o &s;trong of Per&s;ecution, that I would charitably hope no &s;ober Chri&s;tian or Magi&s;trate, who inclines to Moderation (which ought to appear in all) will take any further Notice of them, than to pity his Ignorance.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding his mighty Arguments and great Improvements, he gives them this Blow,
<Q>He has but little hopes of his being convinced, (to whom he writes) becau&s;e of the Efficacy of Error and Delu&s;ion, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>He would have had more Rea&s;on to have writ &s;o, if he had fir&s;t proved Error and Delu&s;ion upon him.

<P>And as for his Prayers, the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>We know that God heareth not Sinners:</HI> And that he is a Sinner, is plain, in wre&s;ting and perverting the Scriptures, as he has done, and as I &s;hall &s;how through the Help of Chri&s;t, my Lord and Saviour.</P>

<P>NOw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1713.</NOTE> pray let us ob&s;erve what he &s;ays to the Matter in hand.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. As to the Laws of <HI>New Eng|land,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>The Laws of this Province require that the Inhabitants of each Town &s;hall take due Care to be con&s;tantly provided with a</HI> Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter: <HI>And that each Mini&s;ter &s;hall be &s;ufficiently &s;upported and main|tained by the Inhabitants of the Town.</HI></P>

<P><HI>And that &s;uch as refu&s;e to pay accordingly, &s;hall have their Proportion taken from them by Di&s;tre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> I &s;hall not here di&s;pute the Inju&s;tice of this Law &s;o largely as I might (only I mu&s;t add, they have no &s;uch Example from Chri&s;t nor the Apo&s;tles, with this Provi&s;o, that it is made among&s;t a Society of Men for them&s;elves, and tho&s;e of their own Communi|on) but if this is intended to force tho&s;e of other Pro|fe&s;&s;ions,

and who cannot for Con&s;cience Sake join with them, believing them to be Antichri&s;tian Mini&s;ters, (as to be &s;ure all &s;uch are as go about to maintain &s;uch Doctrine as this Prie&s;t <HI>Metcalfe</HI> doth, That it is warrantable from Scripture to force Maintenance for Mini&s;ters) Pray would he be willing the Papi&s;ts, or Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould take away from him by Force? Surely no: Then I &s;ay that it is an unju&s;t Law, and far from the Nature of that Royal Law, which &s;ays, <HI>Do to all Men, as you would that they &s;hould do unto you</HI>; Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>This is the Law, and the Prophets.</HI> And doubtle&s;s the Go&s;pel falls not &s;hort of it (though this <HI>N. E.</HI> Mini&s;ter doth) tho' I hope it is not the Mind of all in Profe&s;&s;ion with him. Now the Law be|ing unju&s;t, it is no Crime to reject it: Yet for con|&s;cience Sake, and the Lord's Sake, we &s;ubmit to it in pa&s;&s;ive Obedience; and it is well known to all that know any thing of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that their Principle is again&s;t re&s;i&s;ting the outward Power.</P>
<P>Next to the Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether it be Warrantable from Scripture, and the Doctrine and Practice of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, to put &s;uch Laws in Execution, to take from Men, altho' the Mini&s;ter preaches not to them, for they cannot believe they are &s;ent of God?</HI></P>
<P>This is his great <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> as he &s;tates it in his fir&s;t Page, which he pretends to an&s;wer from Scripture, but falls far &s;hort of it; and he goes on thus:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, <HI>It is Warrantable from Scripture,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that the Inhabitants of each Town &s;hall take due Care, in order to their being &s;upply'd with a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> This is as foreign from his Que&s;tion, as <HI>Rome</HI> is from <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> What is that to the Purpo&s;e? Let the Impartial judge; if he cannot prove a forced Maintenance from Scripture, he doth nothing to his Purpo&s;e, nor according to his grand Que&s;tion in his Title Page, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="006297_0394_10282E47CF924C30">Then he goes on to his &s;econd A&s;&s;ertion, and &s;ays,</P>
<P N="2">2dly, <HI>It is Warrantable from Scripture, that Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters be honourably &s;upported and maintained: Such Maintenance is a Debt due from the People to the Mini|&s;ters in &s;trict Ju&s;tice, and not as a meer Act of Charity: For it is the Hire of their Labour, and the Wages of their Work.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> Hereby he owns him&s;elf, and all that are in his Practice, to be Hirelings, tho' he will not allow others to call him or them &s;o; and quotes the&s;e Texts of Scripture to prove it, <HI>Luke</HI> 10.7. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.8. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.7, 14. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.6. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17, 18. and adds as fal&s;ly, and &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>The Argument which the Apo&s;tle u&s;es for the Gen|tiles Mini&s;tring to the Jews, reaches this Ca&s;e, Rom. <HI>15.27.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> Surely the Man forgets him&s;elf, for tho Apo&s;tle only &s;poke of a free Collection for the poor Saints at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as in the two foregoing ver&s;es plainly appears, Ver&s;e 25. <HI>But now I go to Jeru&s;alem to mini&s;ter unto the Saints,</HI> Ver&s;e 26. <HI>For it hath plea&s;ed them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain Contri|bution for the poor Saints at Jeru&s;alem.</HI> When will our greedy Prie&s;ts take &s;o much Care of the Poor?</P>
<P>As to the Texts of Scripture above quoted, I &s;hall take the Pains to &s;et them down at large, that the Reader may &s;ee how they an&s;wer his grand Que&s;tion: For what Purpo&s;e he concealed them (in his) in Fi|gures, is be&s;t known to him&s;elf. Truly if he had &s;et them down at large, it mu&s;t needs have been plainly manife&s;ted, to every Body that &s;hould read them, that he was in the wrong: For they a&s;&s;ert no &s;uch Thing, as he would have them to prove, <HI>viz.</HI> a for|ced Maintenance for Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters. The fir&s;t is <HI>Luke</HI> 10.7.
<Q>And in the &s;ame Hou&s;e remain eating and drinking &s;uch Things as they give (What could be more again&s;t him?) for the Labourer is worthy of his Hire: Go not from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and

into what City ye enter, and they receive you, eat &s;uch Things as are &s;et before you.</Q>
Where is legal Force here?)</P>
<P>Let this Man have a care left he be one of tho&s;e that are blinded: For he mu&s;t needs be blind, if he cannot &s;ee that this holy Text makes not for his Pur|po&s;e, but directly again&s;t him; here is not a Word of legal Force. It is &s;o far from it, that they were only to eat what was &s;et before them, if they receiv|ed them who were true Mini&s;ters &s;ent of Chri&s;t, which yet will be hard Work for per&s;ecuting Prie&s;ts to prove them&s;elves &s;o; be they of what Religion they may. Well, what &s;hall we do for this legal Force? Why truly we cannot find it in the Go&s;pel, or the New-Te&s;tament. Chri&s;t came to fulfil the Law. and change the Prie&s;thood, and put an End to carnal Ordinances. But it may be <HI>Jo&s;eph Metcalfe</HI> is an Old-Te&s;tament Man (as a certain <HI>N. E.</HI> Convert &s;aid, on an Occa&s;ion well known to &s;ome of them) if he be, and will fol|low the Letter of the Law, he mu&s;t go to knocking down Oxen, and killing of Sheep, which Work I be|lieve they of his Cloth are generally too high for.</P>
<P>The next is 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.8.
<Q>I robb'd other Church|es, taking Wages of them to do you Service.</Q></P>
<P>Surely can any Body be &s;o bold as from this Text to &s;ay that the Apo&s;tle made a common Practice of Preaching for Wages, as our modern Prie&s;ts do now a days? I hope no Chri&s;tian will imagine from tho&s;e Words of the Apo&s;tle, that he was a Thief, or &s;acrilegious Per&s;on, but only a Freedom of Speech, which he u&s;ed to tho&s;e whom he loved, as in Ver&s;e 11. is plain|ly expre&s;&s;ed. It is a familiar Way of Expre&s;&s;ion among our&s;elves, where we know we may be free, when any Thing is given to us from our Friend, Oh I &s;hall rob thee too much: To put any other Con&s;truction upon the Apo&s;tle's Words, would be to make the Apo&s;tle a &s;a|crilegious Per&s;on, and a Robber, which is ab&s;urd. But pray let him &s;peak fairly a little for him&s;elf, and he will

However, if they will not come to this good Re&s;olution, let them forbear abu&s;ing and per&s;ecuting tho&s;e that (by the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t) are.</P>
<P>The next is 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.7, 14.
<Q>Who goeth a Warfare at his own Charges? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the Fruit thereof? Who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk there|of? Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained, that tho&s;e which preach the Go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the Go&s;pel.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> hath left out what he thought made again&s;t it, from the 8th Ver&s;e to the 13th, and 15th, where ho|ly <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, (though he had Power to eat and drink Ver&s;e 4. at free Co&s;t, yet he doth not &s;ay any where, that he had Power to take it by Force, and we think it ought to be preached from an inward Nece&s;&s;ity, and not for an outward Maintenance) <HI>I have u&s;ed none of the&s;e Things, neither have I written tho&s;e Things, that it &s;hould be &s;o done unto me.</HI> I wi&s;h <HI>Jo&s;eph Met|calfe,</HI> and others in his Station, could &s;ay &s;o hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>Now I may proceed to &s;ay &s;omething to each Parti|cular above, as it lieth in the holy Text.</P>

Though if any be poor, and want Help, we have nothing a|gain&s;t it, but are for helping of tho&s;e who can give a good Account of their Calling, and we are &s;o free to do it, that we need no Forcing to it, nor no Law for it.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, <HI>Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the Fruit thereof?</HI></P>
<P>Well, he that hath planted a Vineyard, let him eat the Fruit of it, and welcome; but let him leave other Folks Vineyards alone, left he be counted a Robber in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e; for if the holy Apo&s;tle robbed, it was by Con&s;ent; but the&s;e Preachers now-a-days rob with|out Con&s;ent, even Vineyards which they never planted, but would de&s;troy if they could: Oh! high, ba&s;e, and Antichri&s;tian Practice, with a Witne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, <HI>Who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk thereof?</HI> But who feedeth a Flock, and milks the Flocks of others?</P>

And becau&s;e the poor Sheep of the true Shepherd Je&s;us Chri&s;t, bleat forth tho&s;e Things, tho&s;e inwardly ravening Wolves, who have got only the Sheeps Cloathing outwardly, being known to be &s;uch by their Fruits of Per&s;ecution, will needs put the poor Sheep in their Pounds, when and

<P N="4">4thly, <HI>Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained, that they that preach the Go&s;pel, &s;hall live of the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, he hath ordained that they &s;hould live, but not that they &s;hould force a Living. A ble&s;&s;ed Ordi|nation, and with holy Reverence be it repeated; for and becau&s;e every true Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us knows the &s;weet Benefit of it in a two-fold Sen&s;e. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> He hath a holy Living for his Soul; he is richly fed at his great Ma&s;ter's Table, with the fine&s;t of the Wheat, and as with the holy Honey, or Sweetne&s;s of the Word of Eter|nal Life, which is Strength to him in Weakne&s;s, Riches to him in Poverty, and Joy and Peace to him in Per|&s;ecution, which the World, and all the Per&s;ecutors therein, can never take away from him; ble&s;&s;ed be God in Chri&s;t for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> As to his bodily Living, if he be a true Man, and not a Lover of filthy Lucre, or Gain, he will have Cau&s;e to &s;ay, as his great Ma&s;ter's Servants did of old, that he lacked nothing, e&s;pecially if his Call is from God and Chri&s;t, and not from Man or Money. Oh! this Money, that is a loud Call indeed to our Men-made Mini&s;ters: If at any Time there chance to be two Calls, I always ob&s;erved that the highe&s;t Bid|der carried the Prie&s;t. But where &s;hall we find that the Lord hath ordained that a Mini&s;ter &s;hall have fifty or an hundred Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> (in all the holy Re|cords) for Preaching the Go&s;pel? No, our great High Prie&s;t &s;aid to his, <HI>Freely ye have received, freely give.</HI> But if it had been his Mind, he could as well, and with as great and as good Authority as any of the&s;e Men, have &s;aid, If they will not give it you free|ly, take it by Force. But tho&s;e Forcers know not of what Spirit they are of; if they do, they mu&s;t needs be the greater Hypocrites, and &s;o their Condemnation the greater.</P>

<P>Yes, let tho&s;e which the&s;e Men teach, communi|cate to them; for communicate and legal Force are Words of different Signification. I hope by this Time this Preacher's Eyes will be opened to &s;ee his Error, in Pleading for legal, forced Maintenance, e|&s;pecially from Chri&s;t's and the Apo&s;tles Practice and Doctrine, as recorded in the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>The next Text which he quotes is 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> v. 17, 18.
<Q>Let the Elders which rule well, be counted worthy of double Honour, e&s;pecially they which labour in the Word and Doctrine; for the Scrip|ture &s;aith, Thou &s;halt not muzzle the Ox that tread|eth out the Corn, and the Labourer is worthy of his Reward.</Q></P>
<P>Very well, what is this to his legal Force? Here is nothing of it; tho&s;e that rule well, will not force any Body, nor &s;et the Magi&s;trates upon their Backs, be|cau&s;e they cannot conform to their Ways; tho&s;e mu&s;t be antichri&s;tian Teachers for certain, being oppo&s;ite to Chri&s;t: For he indeed was per&s;ecuted, but never per|&s;ecuted any, nor forced any, tho' it was in his Power; for which Rea&s;on we cannot give tho&s;e Men that dou|ble Honour which they de&s;ire; and for tho&s;e who &s;ay they labour in the Word and Doctrine of our meek Lord, to &s;et the Magi&s;trates upon us, is wicked Ru|ling, in&s;tead of ruling well.</P>
<P>And as for the poor Ox that treads out the Corn, I am far from having him muzzled: But when he bites, and with his Horns pu&s;hes the Sheep, and tramples the growing green Corn to Dirt, I think then he ought to be muzzled and hoppled too.</P>
<P>In his &s;econd Page he &s;ays,
<Q> 3dly, It is the Duty of every Inhabitant in a Town to pay proportionable towards Mini&s;ters Maintenance.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> No, if they are not all of one Per&s;wa&s;ion (and if they were all of one Per&s;wa&s;ion, he hath no &s;uch Pre|cedent

<Q>Oh (&s;ays he) what a Pity it was that they did not hang all the Quakers when they hanged the other four.</Q>
Remarkable was the An&s;wer that one of his Neighbours made him,
<Q>I wonder you are not a&s;hamed to &s;ay &s;o; for you know that the Judgments of God have been on our Country ever &s;ince.</Q>
I mention this as a Caution to the <HI>N.

All which is a Shame to moderate Chri&s;tians; &s;ome of which, of all Per&s;wa&s;ions, I hope there are in the Country and Territories of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>For fir&s;t, &s;ays he,
<Q>None were exempted of old from paying of Tithes for the Maintenance of the Mini&s;try.</Q></P>

<P N="3">3dly, In Page 2d he &s;ays,
<Q>The Apo&s;tle directs in Acts of Charity, that every one contribute in Pro|portion as God had pro&s;pered him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xvi. 2. And that there &s;hould be Equality, every one bearing their equal Proportion of &s;uch a Burthen, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> viii. 13, 14.</Q>
He goes on,
<Q>Much more ought there to be a Proportion or Equality ob&s;erved in the Mainte|nance of the Mini&s;try, which is a Matter of commu|nicative Ju&s;tice; &s;o it was under the Law, and &s;o it &s;hould be under the Go&s;pel.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Prie&s;ts will bring tho&s;e Texts of Holy Scripture, that tend to promote Chari|ty to the Poor, and many In&s;tances out of ancient Au|thors for &s;tirring up Charity to the Poor; yet they will not, when it comes to their Ca&s;e, allow it to be as Charity, but a Debt; as &s;aith our Author in his fir&s;t Page: And <HI>J. Mather,</HI> in a little Book &s;et forth to promote the Maintenance of their Mini&s;ters, in which I ob&s;erve he tells them,
<Q>If they will &s;tand to the old Law of the <HI>Jews,</HI> they mu&s;t have but a Tenth of the Tenth;</Q>
which I &s;uppo&s;e will not &s;atisfy tho&s;e Men that have Hire for Preaching, and Money for Divi|ning: And therefore I think it their be&s;t Way, to let
<PB N="391" REF="006297_0402_10285A91729B3EF8">
the <HI>Jews</HI> old Law alone, and take to the new Law and Covenant of our Great Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And further, if they will bring In&s;tances of Charity to the Poor, out of Scripture, and other Authors, let them be ju&s;t, and always when they would make the Application of it to the Mini&s;try, to put hone&s;tly the Word <HI>Poor</HI> before Mini&s;try; <HI>viz.</HI> poor Prie&s;t, poor Mini&s;ter; otherwi&s;e let them let fall their Argument for Charity for the Poor (which no good Chri&s;tian will go about to di&s;pute again&s;t) and &s;ee what their Argu|ments for Ju&s;tice in the Ca&s;e will do for them. They &s;ay it is a ju&s;t Debt, a Matter of communicative Ju|&s;tice; but when People do not &s;ee Cau&s;e to commune with them, but quite the contrary, and buy none of their Ware or Merchandize, pray what Ju&s;tice is there in this? Why truly none, but a great Deal of Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, He &s;ays,
<Q>If any Man fail of doing his ju&s;t Proportion, he thereby expo&s;es either the Mini&s;ter to lo&s;e &s;o much of his ju&s;t Due</Q>
(but he falls &s;hort of pro|ving it a ju&s;t Due)
<Q>or the other Inhabitants to pay more than their ju&s;t Proportion, and &s;o he is guilty of manife&s;t Wrong and Inju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>No, where the People are not con&s;enting (and if they were con&s;enting, the New-Te&s;tament is &s;ilent to any &s;uch Way of maintaining Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters) to this Pro|portion, but &s;ee an Evil in it; and there is no Force under the glorious Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as I have abundantly and clearly (to tho&s;e who are not blinded) proved above, even from the very Texts of Scripture which he brings and wre&s;ts to prove the con|trary, of which let the Impartial judge. Thus he and they building their Structure of Maintenance upon a bad Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> Legal Force, it will fall to the Ground, if the Magi&s;trates do not help; for who&s;e Help he calls very loud, and well he may, con&s;idering he and others of his Mind are ready to faint and fall without it. But by what hath been &s;aid, I would cha|ritably hope, all moderate Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trates will
<PB N="392" REF="006297_0403_10285A964AC4AEF0">
take Care that the Preachers eat only the Grapes of their own Vine, and the Milk of their own Flock, and keep &s;o far ju&s;t as to let other Folks Grapes and Milk alone. But if the Prie&s;ts and Magi&s;trates will join together in Per&s;ecution, then will we poor Suffe|rers appeal from them to our great High Prie&s;t, and ju&s;t Judge of Heaven and Earth, and through his Grace patiently &s;uffer what he &s;hall plea&s;e to permit to come upon us.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, In his 3d Page he &s;ays,
<Q>The publick Mini|&s;try of the Go&s;pel in any Town is a publick Privilege, and every Inhabitant is con&s;idered therein, and par|takes in the Privilege: For the Preaching of the Go&s;pel is the great Engine of Salvation, and Means of Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 16. x. 17.</Q></P>
<P>If he means that there is no other Preaching the Go&s;pel but from his Sect, we openly declare to the World, that we differ from him in our Judgment, and we believe upon good Grounds too. And what Go&s;|pel, or Glad Tidings (which the Word imports) can that be to People to preach to them, <HI>That a certain Number of them are eternally ordained for Damnation</HI>; and for ought the&s;e knowing Men know, they may them&s;elves be &s;ome of them; for they cannot tell who the&s;e damned Ones are. I think it would be abundant|ly better if tho&s;e prying Mini&s;ters would let the &s;ecret Will of Him that made them alone; for that belongs to God, and not to Man. <HI>The revealed Truths belong to us, and our Children.</HI> And to tell People they can ne|ver be free from the Act of Sin while in this World, is really mi&s;erable News, and dreadful Tidings indeed; &s;ince Sin is the Cau&s;e of God's Wrath and Damnation, and &s;ince we cannot in Con&s;cience join with &s;uch Anti-Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, they ought not in Con&s;cience to take our Money or Goods from us.</P>
<P>Again he &s;ays,
<Q>Every one is invited to take of the Water of Life freely,</Q>
<HI>Rev.</HI> xxvi. 17.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="006297_0404_10285A97F8774E98">But, by their Leave, theirs is the Water of Death, if we mu&s;t always &s;in even in our be&s;t Duties, then he knows, that <HI>the Wages of Sin is Death</HI>; and may not any good Chri&s;tians be truly thankful when they are delivered from &s;uch a &s;inful Mini&s;try? And what a Knock he gives him&s;elf in &s;aying, <HI>We take of it freely,</HI> and his Pages are writ on purpo&s;e to make People be|lieve they ought to pay for it, and that they may force it from them too. So we may plainly &s;ee, that their Waters, which proceed from them in &s;uch bitter Streams, are the Waters of Death; becau&s;e we cannot have them freely, according to the Doctrine of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t in the Holy Scripture, which he him&s;elf hath brought.</P>

<P>This is contrary to what they &s;ay, when they teach that Vi&s;ion and Revelation is cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>He goes on,
<Q>Being without God, without Chri&s;t, without the Covenant, they are in a hopele&s;s, peri&s;h|ing Condition.</Q></P>
<P>If he would infer from the&s;e Words, that where there is no publick vocal Teaching the People peri&s;h, the Al|mighty has been kinder than this Mini&s;ter; for he has graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed, that he would teach his Peo|ple him&s;elf: <HI>The Children of the Lord are taught of the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And thine Eyes &s;hall behold thy Teachers, who cannot be removed into a Corner,</HI> I&s;a. xxx. 20. which cannot be meant of outward Preachers, for they are often removed into Corners, but God, Chri&s;t, and the Holy Spirit, cannot. And Chri&s;t promi&s;ed to &s;end the Spirit of Truth, which &s;hould lead and guide into all Truth (not into Sin.) Now to &s;ay that &s;uch who have not outward vocal Preaching peri&s;h, is ab|&s;urd; and he mu&s;t want Charity, and then all his Ha|rangues in his Pulpit are but like &s;ounding Bra&s;s.</P>

<Q>But where the Kingdom of Satan is preached (<HI>which is Sin Term of Life</HI>) the People have Liberty to fly from it.</Q>

<P>We are willing to be counted Fools by &s;uch Wi&s;e|lings; but let him know, that Wi&s;dom him&s;elf &s;aid, <HI>He that will be wi&s;e, mu&s;t fir&s;t become a Fool.</HI></P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> We want him, or any of his Brethren, to &s;hew us that Warrant from Holy Scripture; for he hath not done it yet: And where &s;hall we find that it is war|rantable from Scripture, and the Doctrine and Practice of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles? For what he has produced from Holy Scripture, has fairly proved to the contrary; and as for his <HI>Legality,</HI> that great Word, 'tis only what others of his Spirit have pleaded in former Ages.

<P>Why not, if found in their Practices?

<P>In Page the 4th he &s;ays,
<Q>God has given his Mi|ni&s;ters a ju&s;t Right to &s;ome Proportion of every Man's E&s;tate, in the Place where they mini&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>What, <HI>Jews, Heathens,</HI> and all? What, every Man what&s;oever? Where proves he that? For my Part, if I were a Mini&s;ter for Money, I &s;hould think that what I got from other People again&s;t their Wills, would never pro&s;per, but would be a Cur&s;e to, and upon me, and tend to the Con&s;umption of the re&s;t of my E&s;tate, rather than augmenting of it: And I have heard &s;ome moderate Mini&s;ters, who have Money for their Preaching, &s;ay the &s;ame.</P>
<P>He goes on further, and &s;ays,
<Q>And that Part of each Man's E&s;tate, which God gives Mini&s;ters a Right to by his ju&s;t and equal Law.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> By his ju&s;t and equal Go&s;pel he forces none; but leaves every one to be fully per&s;waded in their own Minds.'</P>
<P>And he mu&s;t needs &s;ay, <HI>That the Go&s;pel Power ex|ceeds the Power of any Law what&s;oever.</HI></P>
<P>And the Go&s;pel is free, not forced, as he in vain would endeavour to prove from Holy Scripture. That mu&s;t be an unju&s;t Law that forces People to buy whether they will or no, and therefore none of God's Law or Way; for all his Laws and Ways are equal.</P>
<P>And he al&s;o &s;ays in Page the 4th,
<Q>They have as much Power to challenge it as any other Debt or Wages.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="006297_0408_10285AA38F9CB058">Not without People agree with them, and hire them. (And though they do agree with them, I do not grant that they have any Colour from the New-Te&s;tament to make any &s;uch Law, even among them|&s;elves; it being incon&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of the glorious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.) Upon which a Pa&s;&s;age comes into my Mind between an <HI>Indian</HI> and a <HI>N.

<P>Then their Doctrine mu&s;t &s;tarve the Peoples Souls, or el&s;e &s;urely they would not let their Bodies &s;tarve: That mu&s;t needs be a lifele&s;s, dull, dead Mini&s;try, that will not open Peoples Hearts, &s;o as to keep the Preachers from &s;tarving; but I think there is no Fear of their &s;tarving, for they generally live like Lords a|mong the People.

<P>In Page the 5th, he talks of the Law and Light of Nature, and Rea&s;on, <HI>and &s;ays,</HI>
<Q>It is the Law of God written in the Heart,</Q>
<HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 15. <HI>He adds,</HI>
<Q>All the Laws of God do &s;weetly harmonize both one with another, and the Doctrine of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles; there is no Manner of Jarr between any of the&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> But there is a wonderful Jarr between the cor|rupt Nature or Law of Man, and the divine Nature or Law of God; he &s;hould have di&s;tingui&s;hed be|tween the corrupt Nature, Rea&s;on and Law, and the Divine; for except he rightly divides between the Pre|cious and the Vile, he cannot be as the Mouth of God to the People. Now the corrupt and covetous Na|ture in tho&s;e that &s;eek their Gain from their Quarter, and preach for Hire, and divine for Money, &s;ays, 'That tho&s;e that cannot pay them' (tho' for Con|&s;cience &s;ake)
<Q>they mu&s;t be forced, to it, whether they will or no.</Q></P>
<P>But the divine Nature of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles &s;ays, <HI>Freely you have received, freely give.</HI> Matt. x. 8. If their Go&s;pel is not free, they have not received it from Chri&s;t. Al&s;o, if they have not received it freely, they may call it their own Go&s;pel, but it is not Chri&s;t's. And tho' Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters had Power to eat and drink, and to forbear, working, yet, &s;ays the divine Nature in the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I have u&s;ed none of tho&s;e Things; neither do I write, that it &s;hould be &s;o done unto me,</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 15. And that it is not Covetou&s;ne&s;s, that divers <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;o called, cannot pay the covetous Prie&s;ts, is manife&s;t; for they take much more, and &s;ometimes double and treble, as I could ea&s;ily bring ma|ny In&s;tances and living Witne&s;&s;es to prove what I a&s;|&s;ert, from <HI>Virginia, Maryland,</HI> and abundantly in <HI>New-England</HI> (without going over to <HI>Great Britain</HI>) in which many Thou&s;ands of Pounds have tho&s;e legal

Mini&s;ters taken by Force, within the&s;e fifty Years, from &s;uch as for Con&s;cience Sake, could not put it in|to their own Mouths; and then War has been pro|claimed again&s;t tho&s;e poor Sheep. Well, let the Righ|teous judge, not the Self-Righteous (I do not mean them) but tho&s;e which are cloathed upon with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as He wrought it outwardly for them, and al&s;o as He works it by his Holy Spirit, in their Hearts.</P>
<P>Next to his 3dly, Touching Government and Ma|gi&s;trates, which the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> ever own|ed and honoured in their Way, though they could not cringe, &s;crape and bow, after the common Mode of the &s;inful Times, nor give Titles to them in Flattery: But we reckon that tho&s;e Magi&s;trates that are a Ter|ror to Hypocrites and Evil-doers, ought to have a hearty inward Re&s;pect and Honour &s;hown to them generou&s;ly in Action and courteous Expre&s;&s;ion, and not in a Parcel of idle Compliments. Such Magi|&s;trates as the above, were never a Terror unto us, but we have ble&s;&s;ed God on their Behalf in our So|lemn A&s;&s;emblies publickly, and al&s;o often in the Se|cret of our, Souls privately; and many times prayed for our Per&s;ecutors al&s;o. I wi&s;h this Prie&s;t be not too much inclining to &s;uch. May his Eyes be opened!</P>
<P>He goes on, and endeavours to animate and &s;tir up the Magi&s;trates to Per&s;ecution, by in&s;inuating, that tho&s;e who for Con&s;cience Sake cannot give any Thing to the Prie&s;t, are evil, unju&s;t and wicked Per|&s;ons; who, notwith&s;tanding, take them in a general Way, and their Conver&s;ations are as ju&s;t as the brighte&s;t of their Church Members, as divers of them&s;elves are forced to acknowledge.</P>
<P>If for this Te&s;timony to our Innocency, any &s;hould imagine we boa&s;t, it is he, and &s;uch as he, that are the Occa&s;ion of this confident Boa&s;ting, and we have our great Apo&s;tle, even <HI>Paul,</HI> for our Example.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="006297_0411_10285AADC3042010">Now I hope the Magi&s;trates will take Care not to per&s;ecute the Ju&s;t, but to turn the Edge of their Swords again&s;t the Evil-doers; and then doubtle&s;s they will not bear their Swords in vain, and let the Edge of it be as &s;harp and keen as it will, we fear it not: For again&s;t true Men there is no Law (which is upon a ju&s;t Ba&s;is or Foundation) that will harm them.</P>
<P>I tenderly and lovingly, as a Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and true Lover of good Government, exhort and warn all Magi&s;trates to be careful to keep within their own Province: For <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> is none of theirs; it is the peculiar Province of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the great Territory of the King of Kings, and Judge of the Quick and Dead; and he will render unto every Man a Recompence.</P>
<P>Now if Con&s;cience were only a Cloak for Covetou&s;|ne&s;s, it ought to be &s;tript off, but it is plain that can|not be our Ca&s;e: For we lo&s;e much more by our De|nial (and &s;ometimes a great deal more, than as much more) by our not paying freely, as is above &s;aid. But we may (I hope) pre&s;ume that the Magi&s;trates know their Duty, without being taught it from the Pulpit: I would have no free-&s;pirited Magi&s;trate to let Prie&s;ts ride them: For if they do, it is to be doubted they will ride them to Death: For per&s;ecuting Men of their Cloth, &s;eem to have but little Mercy. I once heard a Prie&s;t &s;ay to a Couple of Ju&s;tices (a <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> Preacher for Money, but as him&s;elf &s;aid to &s;ome of his Neighbours, a <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> in his Heart) <HI>Do your Office,</HI> which was upon my poor Self, who had been preaching again&s;t Sin and Evil, according to the be&s;t of my Under&s;tanding (why what's the mat|ter?) <HI>He has been preaching,</HI> &s;ays the Prie&s;t, <HI>in a Place not Licenc'd, and has broke the Law. Well,</HI> &s;ays ano|ther Ju&s;tice be&s;ide the afore&s;aid two, <HI>Then you have broke the Law fir&s;t, for you preached there before him</HI>; and tho' it was our Meeting by Appointment, yet we
<PB N="401" REF="006297_0412_10285AAF95D90480">
quietly heard him read his Sermon, and I dare &s;ay, he never had quieter Hearers in all his Days than we were.</P>
<P>And indeed Reading is the general Practice of &s;ome modern Teachers, far from the Practice of Chri&s;t, the Apo&s;tles, and primitive Chri&s;tians, when Chri&s;ti|anity &s;hone in its primitive Beauty and Glory, and when Chri&s;tians depended more upon the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t (or Spirit) and le&s;s upon natural Parts and human Inventions, which is worthy of the &s;olid Con&s;ideration of all true Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o ob&s;erved that tho&s;e Magi&s;trates which have joined with per&s;ecuting Prie&s;ts in per&s;ecut|ing Men of &s;ober Lives and Conver&s;ations for their religious Di&s;&s;ent and Per&s;wa&s;ion, that they have not pro&s;pered; and many &s;ober People, not of our Society, have taken notice of the &s;ame. This is offer|ed to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of Men of high De|gree (in Reverence and great Humility.)</P>
<P>And tho' <HI>J. M.</HI> flatters the Magi&s;trates, telling them, they bear the vi&s;ible Image and Character of Gods, in order to flatter them into a per&s;ecuting Spirit, yet I hope, and believe, that he will not find many Magi|&s;trates nor Mini&s;ters of his Mind: For if all the Ma|gi&s;trates and Mini&s;ters in <HI>N. E.</HI> were as much for Per|&s;ecution as he &s;eems to be by his writing, what might all tho&s;e expect, who differ from the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Way in <HI>N. E.</HI> if they had Power? But ble&s;&s;ed be God, I certainly know that there are divers moderate Peo|ple, who are again&s;t Per&s;ecution, even among&s;t the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>In his Page 7th, <HI>he &s;ays,</HI>
<Q>In Ca&s;e of People's De|fect in this Matter (of paying for Preaching) legal Compul&s;ion is the only Remedy (What no other Remedy?) and mu&s;t be u&s;ed, otherwi&s;e Religion, which is a People's Life, will &s;oon fall to the Ground.</Q></P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> But I thought that God had been the <HI>Keeper</HI> of his People, and Chri&s;t the <HI>Shepherd</HI> of his Sheep, and the Holy Gho&s;t the <HI>Comforter</HI> of them; I thought this Infinite Being had been the great Pre&s;er|ver of Men in Religion.</P>
<P>In his 8th Page, he brings divers Texts of Scrip|ture to prove the Power of the Magi&s;trates, which we never denied, e&s;pecially when he exerci&s;es his Power and Authority to the Terror of Evil-doers, and the Prai&s;e of them that do well. And at the latter End of the &s;aid Page <HI>he &s;ays,</HI>
<Q>From the whole I conclude, with Submi&s;&s;ion to better Judgments, that it is War|rantable from Scripture, and agreeable to the Doc|trine and Practice of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, for the Laws afore&s;aid to be put in Execution.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> But alas! this is all be&s;ide his A&s;&s;ertion; his Bu&s;ine&s;s was to prove a legal forced Maintenance for Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, or el&s;e he doth nothing. What! hath he been travelling through all his Pages, and brought forth nothing but this windy Doctrine at la&s;t? He &s;peaks of Submi&s;&s;ion to better Judgments, and I would have him, if he dare to do it, &s;ubmit to the Judgment of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, who I think have fairly decided the Que&s;tion in favour of the poor abu&s;ed <HI>Quakers,</HI> that it is not according, but contrary to the Language of the Holy Gho&s;t, in the Holy Scripture, that Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters Maintenance &s;hould be forced by a coercive Power.

<P>As for his fooli&s;h Pity and bitter Lamentation over us, we de&s;ire that they would lament over them|&s;elves and their Children, as our Saviour did over the <HI>Jews</HI>

<HEAD>The PREFACE to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>CHRIST being the great Author of the Chri&s;ti|an Religion, I have thought to make &s;ome Ob&s;erva|tions on his Sermon which he preached on the <HI>Mount,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> v, vi, vii.</NOTE> might be acceptable to &s;ome of his Followers; e&s;pecially &s;uch who de&s;ire to fulfil his holy Will, and not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;a|tisfied in a Form and Shew only of his Religion.</P>
<P>And al&s;o con&s;idering that it is the greate&s;t Collec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of his Words left us in the New Te&s;tament by the Evan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ts in any one Place, I was in Hopes that &s;ome Ob&s;erva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s thereon might tend to promote the reading of it in the Ho|ly Scriptures.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t End I had in this Undertaking was, That the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Name of Holy JESUS might live and walk in his Truth, and in the Doctrine which he has there laid down for his Followers to practice; and that
<PB N="ccccxii" REF="006297_0423_10285AD45B0BC460">
in &s;o doing, they might have Peace to their Souls here, and Re&s;t in the Kingdom of Glory for ever.</P>
<P>It is by &s;ome accounted and lock'd upon in Youth to be a commendable and worthy Practice to write down Sermons, and to copy and read them over: And, I believe, it will be gene|rally acknowledged, that there was never any Sermon preached in the World, that can be compared with this of Chri&s;t, which he preached in the <HI>Mount,</HI> and is recorded by the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Matthew,</HI> in his <HI>5th, 6th,</HI> and <HI>7th</HI> Chapters; which if our young and ri&s;ing Generation would often read, and &s;ometimes write it down (if Time would admit) but be &s;ure to take Care to practi&s;e it; this would be truly noble in them; and which if they find they want inward Strength to perform, then that they would &s;eek it in Secret at the Hand of the Almighty <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> in whom is everla&s;ting Strength; and 'tis recorded in Holy Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>James</HI> 1.5. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 34.10. <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.17.</NOTE> That he <HI>gives liberally, and upbraideth not.</HI> He will not upbraid thee becau&s;e thou art but a Child, or tender in Years: Oh, therefore, &s;eek Him be|times! for it is written, <HI>They who &s;eek Him early, they &s;hall find Him.</HI></P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Religion being run into many Divi&s;ions and Sub-divi&s;ions, this Holy Sermon, if Chri&s;tians would walk according to it, might and would help to heal their Differences, and to &s;often them in their Sentiments one of another. And 'tis to be believed and hoped, that all Par|ties will confe&s;s, that the Doctrine in this Sermon is good, and ought to be promoted among&s;t all who profe&s;s the worthy Name of the Lord Je&s;us; and whoever walks contrary to this Rule mu&s;t needs be in the Wrong.</P>
<P>The general End of Preachers is, or &s;hould be, to have their Doctrine taken Notice of, and put in Practice; and this being Coun&s;el from the <HI>Wonderful,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> 9.6.</NOTE> <HI>Coun&s;ellor, the Mighty God</HI> (and Saviour) <HI>the Everla&s;ting Father, and Prince of Peace,</HI> we &s;hould take more than ordinary Notice of it.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;idering al&s;o, that he not only &s;pake his Doctrine, but lived in it; and not only lived in, but died in it, and
<PB N="ccccxiii" REF="006297_0424_10285AD71CCB23B8">
for it, and us al&s;o. Wherefore we are deeply engaged to hear Him with an obedient Heart and Ear.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3.17.</NOTE> <HI>This</HI> (&s;ays the Voice from the mo&s;t Excellent Glory) <HI>is my beloved Son, hear ye him.</HI> And <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Man of God, &s;ays,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 18.19.

<P>I have carefully tran&s;cribed the Sermon verbatim, and made &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on it afterward, I think on every Ver&s;e a little, as I found Openne&s;s to it on my Mind; and 'tis recommended to the &s;erious Peru&s;al and Con&s;idera|tion of all tho&s;e who tenderly and unfeignedly love our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in Sincerity.</P>

meddling with Thi&s;tles and Thorns, they being gene|rally very unprofitable to Mankind, and hurt the good Seed, wherever they grow among it. Well, where mu&s;t we go for the Grapes, and the Figs? To be &s;ure we mu&s;t go to the Vine, and the Fig-Tree: Chri&s;t is the Body of this Vine, and his People are the Branches, who bring forth &s;uch Fruit (according to the Divine Life or Sap which they receive) as he taught, and teaches, to his Followers. So that if Mens Words be like the Words of Angels, if they have never &s;o great Parts and Endowments; yet if their Fruit be evil, if they live in Sin, and do Iniqui|ty, and bring forth the Fruits of Malice and Rage, or devouring Per&s;ecution, they then are none of Chri&s;t's Sheep, though they my have their Clothing: <HI>For every good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit; and a cor|rupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit.</HI> So if the Fruit be evil, the Tree is certainly corrupt.

And then, <HI>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, nor can a cor|rup Tree bring forth good Fruit: And every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and ca&s;t into the Fire.</HI> It would be very unnatural, and a meer Prodigy, for one Tree to hew down another, and ca&s;t it into the Fire, as they are natural Trees:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 3.10.</NOTE> But that Ax (which <HI>John</HI> &s;peaks of) will be laid to the Roots of the corrupt Trees, and will hew them down, and they will be ca&s;t into the Fire, as Chri&s;t &s;peaks. This is not a de&s;troying the Bodies of Men that Chri&s;t &s;peaks of but an inward work in the Soul, &s;hewing the powerful Nature of the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which is not material Cutting, or Burning with material Fire, or Sword: But Chri&s;t's Word is a Fire

<P>It is not our Profe&s;&s;ion that will give us Admit|tance into Heaven, nor a Name of Religion, nor re|ligious Performances, if we love Sin and Unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, nor our praying, preaching, hearing, reading or di&s;|cour&s;ing of, or arguing for Chri&s;t, if we do the Works of Satan; for there are many who may yet go farther than this, and yet not have Admittance into the Kingdom of God and our ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us, as is plainly manife&s;t in the next Ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 22. <HI>Many will &s;ay unto me in that Day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophe&s;ied in thy Name, and in thy Name have ca&s;t cut Devils, and in thy Name have done many wonderful Works?</HI></P>

<P>So that profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t's own Name, and prophe|&s;ying therein, without working the Works of God, will not do. Nay, though they may ca&s;t out Devils, which indeed is a great Work, and here is not only one Devil in the Singular Number, but Devils in the Plural. They &s;ay they have ca&s;t out Devils, and truly there are many Devils in poor Mortals &s;ometimes, as was &s;aid by them to Chri&s;t; <HI>Our Name is Legion, for we are many.</HI> There are the Devils of Pride, Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s, Whoredom, Theft, Envy, Murder, Lying, Swearing, Hypocri&s;y, Cheating, Back<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and abundance more, which cannot ea&s;ily be named; and though it may be &s;aid, and

that truly, that all the&s;e proceed from the Devil, who is an evil Spirit; yet it may al&s;o be &s;aid, that there are many evil Spirits; and if all the&s;e evil Spirits are ca&s;t out of Man, and others of an evil Nature enter him again, his la&s;t State is wor&s;e than his Beginning, as Chri&s;t &s;peaks about the &s;trong Man armed, who kept the Hou&s;e till a &s;tronger than he came, who,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 12.45.</NOTE> when he came, &s;poiled his Goods, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him; but coming again found the Hou&s;e (or Heart) &s;wept and garni&s;hed, &s;wept from many Immoralities, and garni&s;hed with Self-righteou&s;ne&s;s and carnal Security; and the Man off his Watch, and not at home with Chri&s;t, who is &s;tronger than Satan, he then re-enters, and &s;even wor&s;e Spirits with him. So that we had need to be on our Watch, and keep near to Chri&s;t, le&s;t after all our Experience, and wondrous Works, our la&s;t State be wor&s;e than our Beginning, and we &s;hut out of the Kingdom in the End. For the&s;e &s;ay, that they had done many wonderful Works in Chri&s;t's Name: So that we may work miraculous Things, and be &s;en&s;ible of wonderful Power and Strength from Chri&s;t; and yet, without per&s;evering in the Way of Holine&s;s and Self denial, may fall &s;hort of Heaven. Wherefore it is bad, and of dangerous Con&s;equence, to live in Sin and Iniquity; or to lean towards it, &s;o as to plead for it, or believe we cannot live without it while in this World. For if we live and die in it, we may ju&s;tly (according to the above Doctrine, of Chri&s;t) expect that he will &s;ay unto us in the great Day; <HI>Depart from me, ye that work Ini|quity.</HI></P>
<P>Ver&s;e 24. <HI>Therefore who&s;oever heareth the&s;e Sayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him to a wi&s;e Man, which built his Hou&s;e upon a Rock.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="462" REF="006297_0473_10285B7004010E10">Oh! what abundance of excellent Sayings, and Doctrine, what holy Precepts has Chri&s;t here recom|mended to the Profe&s;&s;ors of his Name, and to them which believe in him, and the Almighty Father and Maker of Heaven and Earth, Surely we are greatly beholden to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for tho&s;e plain Di|vine Sayings. But to commend them only is but little, or to read them, or hear them: The keeping and the doing of them is the main Thing; the Thing that is needful; and to pre&s;s the Practice of them, Je&s;us has made this apt Compari&s;on.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t, He that hears them, and doth them, I will liken him to a wi&s;e Man</HI>: And indeed it is great Wi&s;dom to keep them (that is, to practice them) and as great Folly to live contrary to them, and plead again&s;t them.</P>

And <HI>Peter</HI> was one who heard the&s;e Say|ings, and did them, when he had received the Holy Gho&s;t or Spirit; for which every true Believer ought to pray continually, until he receive it; through the Help of which he may, without Doubt, keep tho&s;e holy Sayings.

<P>Ver&s;e 26. <HI>And every one that heareth the&s;e Sayings of mine, and doth them not, &s;hall be likened unto a fooli&s;h Man, which built his Hou&s;e upon the Sand.</HI></P>

<P>If we read or hear the&s;e Sayings, or Doctrine of Chri&s;t, and do not dwell in the Life of it, nor practice the &s;ame, it were better we knew it not. For as our Saviour &s;aith, <HI>He that knoweth his Ma&s;ter's Will, and doth it not, &s;hall be beaten with many Stripes.</HI> And doubtle&s;s it is great Folly to be &s;en&s;ible of Chri&s;t's ho|ly Will, and Doctrine, and not to do it: If we pro|fe&s;s Chri&s;tianity, and to build our Profe&s;&s;ion on Chri&s;t, and yet not ob&s;erve to keep his Sayings, the Foundati|on of our Building will be but very loo&s;e and &s;andy; and when tho&s;e Rains, and Floods, and Winds, which Chri&s;t &s;peaks of, &s;hall de&s;cend and come, and beat a|gain&s;t this Building, it mu&s;t needs fall, and the high|er his Building is, the greater will be the Fall of it.</P>
<P>Thus ended the be&s;t Sermon that ever was preach|ed by Man; in which is &s;et forth the great Truths of God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with Ble&s;&s;ings and Rewards to the Righteous, and holy Believers in him, who put in practice his Precepts; and Reproof to the Di&s;obedient, and Unfaithful; with Promi&s;es of the Kingdom of Heaven to the former, and to the latter a being &s;hut out of it. And when he had ended

his Doctrine for that time, and fini&s;hed his Divine Sayings, the People were &s;mitten with it, to Admi|ration, as well indeed they might.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 28. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s, when Je&s;us had end|ed the&s;e Sayings, that the People were a&s;toni&s;hed at his Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>Ver&s;e 29. <HI>For he taught them as one having Autho|rity, and not as the Scribes.</HI></P>
<P>They were a&s;toni&s;hed at his Doctrine, and well they might, for it excelled even the Law, and went beyond it, as when he tells them, 'twas &s;aid of old Time, or in the Law, <HI>Thou &s;halt not Kill</HI>: He taught that we mu&s;t not be angry without Cau&s;e. And whereas the Law gives Liberty to hate our Enemies; he charges us to love them, and pray for them, and do good to them; again the Law prohibits Adulte|ry; Chri&s;t prohibits Lu&s;ts, both in the Eye, and in the Heart. And whereas the Law commanded to perform their Oaths to the Lord; Chri&s;t commands not to &s;wear at all. Now tho&s;e who are not angry, it is not likely they &s;hould kill; tho&s;e who love their Enemies cannot hate or de&s;troy them; tho&s;e who have not Lu&s;t in their Hearts or Eyes, cannot com|mit Adultery; and tho&s;e who never &s;wear, cannot fore&s;wear them&s;elves: All which he with Divine Pow|er and Authority from above taught. He was not dry and formal like the Scribes: So likewi&s;e his Mini&s;ters, and the Preachers of his Go&s;pel, &s;hould wait on him, to be endued with a Mea&s;ure of his Divine Spirit and Holy Grace, that the Hearers might be edified, and the Father, Son, and Spirit, might have the Glory, who over all is worthy for ever.</P>

<P>SINCE I wrote the above (which was writen at Sea in my Voyage from <HI>Barbados</HI> to <HI>London</HI>) I have heard that a learned Man hath wrote upon this excellent Sermon of Chri&s;t (which far exceeds what I have done) at which I rejoice; for the more Chri&s;t is glorified, and his faithful Followers edified, the great|er is our Cau&s;e of Rejoicing; and if it exceeds this, it is no wonder, this being done by one who doth not profe&s;s to under&s;tand Grammar, neither is a Ma&s;ter of Words, nor &s;carcely of good <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Peradventure through the Meanne&s;s of the In&s;trument, the Glory of God, and Prai&s;e of Chri&s;t, may the more appear; as &s;aid Chri&s;t, <HI>Out of the Mouths of Babes thou ha&s;t ordain|ed Prai&s;e, or Strength:</HI> And again, <HI>Thou ha&s;t revealed the&s;e Things to Babes and Sucklings.</HI> And the <HI>Jews</HI> marvelled that the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t &s;hould know the Things of God, being unlearned Men.

<HEAD>Some truly tender SCRUPLES of CONSCIENCE, about that Form of Prayer, called the COMMON PRAYER, As u&s;ed by the MEMBERS of the Church of <HI>ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1717.</NOTE>1. AS to the Reading the Holy Scriptures, ei|ther privately or openly, that I am not again&s;t, but would encourage it in all Chri&s;tians and true Believers in Chri&s;t, and we ought to excite one another thereto, and more e|&s;pecially to put in Practice what we read to be our Du|ty, otherwi&s;e the holy Letter will kill (as &s;aith the A|po&s;tle, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 6.) which is to be under&s;tood when we practice contrary to what we read therein. As for Example, where our Lord &s;aith, <HI>Every idle Word that Man &s;hall &s;peak, they &s;hall give Account thereof, in the Day of Judgment,</HI> Matt. xii. 36. Again, "God will not hold him guiltle&s;s, that taketh his Name in vain." <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.7. "That Servant that knew his Lord's Will, and did it not, &s;hall be beaten with many Stripes," <HI>Luke</HI> xii. 47. The&s;e, and many more Por|tions of Holy Scripture, are condemning and killing to tho&s;e who live in Sin and Evil, which the Letter is ab&s;olutely again&s;t, and without true Repentance, ac|companied with Amendment of Life, though the Holy Bible be read every Day, it will but add to our Condemnation. But if People truly repent of the Evil of their Ways, and awake to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;in not, as the Holy Scriptures them&s;elves hold, and
<PB N="467" REF="006297_0478_10285B829BB17E28">
Chri&s;t taught, then unto &s;uch Souls they are a rich Trea&s;ure, and as a Cabinet full of precious Jewels, "able to make the Man of God wi&s;e to Salvation, through Faith" in Chri&s;t (by the Influence of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t or Spirit) It is not the Reading (divinely in|&s;pired Writings, or) the Bible, which is &s;crupled; but the formal Reading of formal compo&s;ed Prayers and Songs, at &s;et Times, in&s;tituted by &s;uch who&s;e Principle is, that there is now no Divine Revelation, and that we can't live without &s;inning, while we are in this Life, according to the Tenor of the Common Pray|er; holding, that we &s;in as long as we live, as if God's Power were not &s;tronger to pre&s;erve out of Sin, than the Devil is to keep us in Sin, contrary to the Work and Doctrine of the Holy Apo&s;tles, who were &s;ent of God to turn People from Satan's Power, to the Pow|er of God; who&s;e Glorious, Eternal Power, is above the Power of Sin, Death, and the Devil.</P>
<P>In the Common Prayer &s;ome un&s;ound Words, and al&s;o &s;ome Scripture Expre&s;&s;ions, perverted to a wrong U&s;e, I would a little open, or write a few Words con|cerning.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> "As to that Expre&s;&s;ion in the Common Pray|er, that we are mi&s;erable Sinners."</P>

<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> "And that we have left undone the Things which we ought to do, and do tho&s;e Things which we ought not to do; and this to be repeated for Life."</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, If People mu&s;t be mi&s;erable Sinners all their Days, to what End did Chri&s;t come into the World and preach the Go&s;pel, and &s;uffer Death, the painful Death of the Cro&s;s? Did he not come to put an End to Sin, and to de&s;troy the Works of the De|vil, who&s;e Works are Sin? Did he not preach again&s;t Sin, both within, and without? Witne&s;s the 5th, 6th,

and 7th Chapters of the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Matthew.</HI> Yea, his Birth, Life, Preaching, Suffering, Death and Re|&s;urrection, and A&s;cen&s;ion into Glory, were all again&s;t Sin, the Devil, Death and Darkne&s;s, and all the Works and Deeds thereof. Chri&s;t died for our Sins, and we &s;hould die to them, and live to him: He came to &s;ave us from the Act of Sin, as well as the Imputation of it; and takes away the Guilt of Sin, on Condition of true Repen|tance and Amendment of Life, as the Doctrine of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles do largely and plainly demon|&s;trate, as any who are come to the Years of Di&s;cretion, and who can but read the Holy Scriptures, may plain|ly di&s;cover.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>What&s;oever Things are holy, what&s;oever Things are pure, ju&s;t, and of good Report, &s;eek after tho&s;e Things.</HI> And again, <HI>No unclean Thing can enter the Kingdom of Heaven</HI>; but certainly all Sin is unclean. Read over the Holy Scriptures, from the Beginning to the End, their Nature and Tendency is again&s;t all Sin; and as it is true, that we all have been Sinners, &s;urely therefore all true Chri&s;tians, and true Believers in Chri&s;t, have Cau&s;e reverently to bow, and to be truly and humbly thankful, that Chri&s;t, our great Lord, by his offering him&s;elf for us, hath taken away that Imputation; &s;o that now through true Faith, and Belief in Chri&s;t, accompanied with true Repentance, and Amendment of Life, the Imputation of our former Sins is taken away; for which Cau&s;e we prai&s;e God, and adore his Eternal Maje&s;ty for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> As to the Word <HI>mi&s;erable,</HI> a Chri&s;tian may in|deed be poor; but &s;ince Chri&s;t is come to make us happy and comfortable, through the Hope of eternal Salvation, in his Name and Power (as we are not to think our&s;elves better than we are) &s;o we cannot &s;ay nor think we are mi&s;erable, unle&s;s we are without God and Chri&s;t; and then we are mi&s;erable indeed; but no Mortal can be mi&s;erable, who hath Chri&s;t; <HI>for he that

Save me, or I am undone for ever! Then the Soul &s;eeth it&s;elf mi&s;erable; but it is for want of Chri&s;t: And when Chri&s;t is come into, or unto the Soul, then its Mi&s;ery vani&s;heth, or flieth away; but from Day to Day, and Week to Week, yea, all the Days of one's Life; to be mi&s;erable Sinners, is a mi&s;erable Ca&s;e indeed, de&s;troying the very Nature of Chri&s;tianity: Wherefore, &s;ome tender, con&s;cientious Souls, cannot join with &s;uch mi&s;erable Sinners and Sayers, who neither &s;ay nor do that which they ought.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> As to the&s;e Sayings, <HI>We are full of Brui&s;es and putrifying Sores, from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, and that there is no Soundne&s;s in us.</HI></P>

<P>It is a great Evil which many are prone to <HI>(i. e.) Keeping of vain and idle Company,</HI> which has brought many a <HI>young Man,</HI> and <HI>young Woman,</HI> to utter Ruin and De&s;truction, both Body and Soul. How many

<DIV3 TYPE="example">
<HEAD>The fir&s;t In&s;tance of a young Man, given to ill Com|pany, and hard Drinking.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t is of a certain <HI>Beautiful</HI> young Man, a Phy&s;ician by Profe&s;&s;ion, who was much addicted to ill Company, and to drink hard, and was &s;ometimes vi&s;ited with &s;trong Convictions; in one of which Vi|&s;itations he &s;ent for me, and told me his Condition, and made <HI>&s;olemn Covenants, if God would but that once &s;pare him, he would not do the like Evil again.</HI> At that Time it did plea&s;e the Almighty to &s;pare him; but he &s;oon forgat how it had been with him; and fell into the &s;ame <HI>Sin</HI> again; altho' he had a mo&s;t no|table Admonition in a <HI>Dream,</HI> but a little before. His Dream was this, which is very remarkable, we being then at Sea, in Sight of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> he &s;aw in his Dream a great and &s;pacious Town, the Buildings high, and Streets broad; at which he landed, and going up the Street, he e&s;pied a large Sign, on which was written in great Golden Letters, <HI>SHAME,</HI> to
<PB N="485" REF="006297_0496_10282E7A563A3F20">
which he went, and at the Door &s;tood a Woman, with a Cann of drink in her Hand; who a&s;ked him to drink? To which he reply'd, <HI>With all his Heart, for he &s;aid, he had drank nothing but Water a great While:</HI> So he took the Cann, and drank a hearty Draught, which, as he &s;aid, <HI>made him merry,</HI> and he went reeling up the Street, when, behold on a &s;udden, a grim Fel|low met him, and arre&s;ted him in the Name of the Governor of the Place, before whom he brought him. This Governor, he &s;aid, was like a great <HI>Black Dog,</HI> the large&s;t that ever he &s;aw, who grinned at him, and <HI>pa&s;&s;ed Sentence</HI> on him, and &s;ent him to Pri&s;on, there to lie for ever. He told me this Dream, with &s;uch an <HI>Empha&s;is,</HI> as made me to tremble, which was thus interpreted to him; I told him, that he was an ingenious young Man, and might ea&s;ily di&s;cern the Interpretation of this Dream, which to me &s;eem'd to be ominous to him: <HI>The great Town and high Build|ings, is thy great and high Profe&s;&s;ion; the Sign, on which</HI> SHAME <HI>was writ, with the Woman with the Cann</HI> at the Door, &s;heweth the great Shame <HI>of the Sin of</HI> Drunkenne&s;s, <HI>and that it is thy Weakne&s;s; and that grim Fellow, that arre&s;ted thee, is</HI> Death, <HI>who will ar|re&s;t all Mortals; and the great black Dog, the Go|vernor of the Place, is the</HI> Devil; <HI>who, when his Ser|vants have &s;erved him to the la&s;t, will torment them for ever.&mdash;God forbid, it is but a Dream,</HI> was his An&s;wer to me. I &s;aid, it was a very &s;ignificant one to him.</P>
<P>About three Days after, the &s;ame Per&s;on went on board a Ship, who&s;e Loading was <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Brandy</HI>; the Ma&s;ter gave a Cann of Wine to him, and &s;aid the &s;ame Words, as the Woman &s;aid to him in his Dream, and he an&s;wered with the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions, and it had the &s;ame Effect upon him; for he took &s;uch a hearty Draught as made him <HI>too merry,</HI> in&s;o|much that he over&s;et the Boat, and was drowned, <HI>much in Drink:</HI> And I &s;eeing him &s;ink down, and

<P>Oh! methinks I could wi&s;h that the many righte|ous Judgments of the mo&s;t High, might effectually Work on the Hearts of tho&s;e People, who are in the Flower of their Age, to their Conver&s;ion and Salva|tion.</P>

<P>THE &s;econd is of a Merchant, about Thirty-five Years of Age, whom I &s;aw take Leave of, and bid adieu to this World: He was one who had &s;pent much Time in keeping <HI>unprofitable Company</HI> and <HI>Over-drinking,</HI> which Practice wa&s;ted his Strength and Fle&s;h, as it did his Time and Money, and brought him into a deep Con&s;umption; as it has done many to my cer|tain Knowledge; be&s;ides bringing the racking painful Di&s;temper of the <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> and many other Mi&s;eries; &s;o that at la&s;t it brought him to his Chamber; and then to his Bed: And in his Sickne&s;s, he &s;everal Times &s;ent for me, and made &s;erious Acknowledgments of his <HI>former mi&s;pent Time, and hop'd, if the Lord would &s;pare him, to be more careful for the Time to come.</HI> But he was no longer to be tru&s;ted here in this World; for he went not out until he was carried in his Coffin: He held my Hand fa&s;t in his, until he died, and was &s;en|&s;ible to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>One Day, as he lay on his Death-bed, he call'd me to him, into his Chamber, and, <HI>charged me to caution the young People to be careful how they keep (and &s;pend their Time in)</HI> Evil Company, <HI>for it had been his Ru|in, and now lay as a great and heavy Burden on his Con|&s;cience: Oh!</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>if they did but feel one Quarter of an Hour, what I feel, they never would keep &s;uch Company any more: Tell this to my former Companions:</HI></P>

So that he ran about the Streets, with a naked Sword, and talked of killing one of the

<P>I never &s;aw any depart the World any ways like him; and indeed it was very amazing, and greatly af|fected my Mind with Sorrow: For I thought he was very unfit to die.

<P>Oh! Dear Souls, look to him (who is invi&s;ible to the outward Eye) who is God over all, and is ble&s;&s;ed for ever, and may you, if this comes to you, feel the Divine Life and Spirit of Chri&s;t, in the Reading of this little Epi&s;tle of Brotherly Love.</P>
<P>Live in Love, for God is Love, and all tho&s;e who dwell in Divine Love, they dwell in God; where|fore love one another, that thereby you may be known to be Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples: <HI>For,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>by this &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another,</HI> or <HI>if ye love one another</HI>; as one of the Evanglie&s;ts hath it.</P>
<P>And keep low in Mind, and humble in Spirit; for the Humble God will teach of his Ways, and the Meek he will guide in Judgment, and tho&s;e whom he teaches, are taught the My&s;teries of his Kingdom, which My&s;teries he teaches to Spiritual Babes and Sucklings (Glory to his holy Name!) He often hides tho&s;e holy My&s;teries from the Wi&s;e and Prudent, and reveals them to &s;uch Men, Women, and Children, as are little in their own Eyes, and de&s;pi&s;ed by the Wi&s;e in natural Wi&s;dom, or the Wi&s;dom of this vain World.</P>
<P>Oh! mind your heavenly Guide Dear Friends, let me entreat you; for he leads out of all Sin, and out of all Vanity and Evil, of what Kind &s;oever; and as our Saviour &s;aith, <HI>into all Truth.</HI> When Chri&s;t comes by his Grace and Spirit into the Heart, then He opens the Soul, and enlightens the Under&s;tanding, even in our common Conver&s;ation; and much more

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>IN order to promote and exalt the Kingdom of the dear Son of God (according to the Gift and Mea&s;ure of Grace received) I was concerned to write the following Tract at Sea; and con&s;idering the evil Tendency of the Belief and Principle which hath over&s;pread a great Part of the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, that we cannot be free from Sin in this Life; and that it is contrary to the Doctrine of the holy Scriptures of both the New, and Old Te&s;tament; I could not be ea&s;y in my Mind, without oppo&s;ing &s;uch a dangerous Tenet: For if we believe that we mu&s;t always &s;in, this being a &s;inful Faith, "according to our Faith, &s;o it will be unto us;" and if we die in our Sins, Chri&s;t hath told us, "where he is gone, we cannot come." And holy Record informs us, "that no unclean Thing can enter God's Kingdom."</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have al&s;o, for the further Satisfaction of the true Chri&s;tian Believer, collected the following Texts of Holy Scripture, which maintain the Doctrine of Holine&s;s and Perfection; and directly oppo&s;e that evil Principle, and that Doctrine, that we can never be free from Sin, in this Life.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1719.</NOTE>IN the Chri&s;tian World 'tis too generally believed, that People on this Side the Grave cannot be free from Sin; which Principle, or Belief, is a great Lett and Hindrance to the glorious Work of Re|formation, and mightily ob&s;tructs People in their Way to Eternal Glory, and tends to uphold the Kingdom of Satan, which every good Chri&s;tian (with Saint <HI>Paul</HI>) &s;hould be for pulling down; and, in order to this, &s;hould make U&s;e of the Weapons that he did, that is, the <HI>Armour of Light</HI>; which Wea|pons were, and are, <HI>The Preparation of the Go&s;|pel of Peace, the Girdle of Truth, Helmet of Salvati|on, Brea&s;t-plate of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Shield of Faith, and Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</HI> This is in|deed a holy War, to war again&s;t Sin and Satan; and al&s;o heavenly Armour, the <HI>Armour of Light</HI>; and this holy Apo&s;tle was a valiant Soldier, who was al&s;o victorious in this War: Oh who would but li&s;t them&s;elves under Chri&s;t's Banner, and fight this Fight of Faith with Courage, and true Chri&s;tian Valour! Then would they witne&s;s the Truth of that Saying of the Apo&s;tle, "That the Weapons of this Warfare are not carnal, but mighty, through God, to the pulling down the &s;trong Holds of Sin and Satan." Oh! down with tho&s;e &s;trong Holds, down with them; let every Lover of Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ay, and pray, That
<PB N="501" REF="006297_0512_10285BCEC63A9AC0">
the Kingdom of God, and his Chri&s;t, may be exalted over all, for ever. Sin is the chief Support of Satan's Kingdom, which Chri&s;t came to de&s;troy and put an End to, and to bring in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, actual Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, as well as imputative; he came to &s;ave his People from their Sins, not only by Imputation, but by holy Action al&s;o; as his holy Doctrine in his ex|cellent Sermon on the Mount, and his many other Di|vine Expre&s;&s;ions, do plainly and abundantly manife&s;t. Now con&s;idering the great Evil of this dangerous Prin|ciple, I have been deeply affected on Account of poor Mankind, to who&s;e utter Ruin and eternal De|&s;truction it mo&s;t certainly tends. If we were to rea&s;on as Men and rational Beings, with what Spirit and Courage &s;hould we undertake any Bu&s;ine&s;s, Journey, or Concern, if before-hand we were grounded in a Belief that we could not perform our Undertaking? Or what Nation or People in the World would have any Courage to engage their common Enemies, if at the &s;ame time they did believe they &s;hould never overcome them, would not this abundantly di&s;pirit and di&s;courage them in their Engagement, let any rational Soul judge? Oh! this Belief of Sinning to the End of our Days, is a mighty Engine of Satan, in order to &s;upport his Kingdom, and a wonderful Prop to uphold it. Pray what &s;ignifies all the Preaching and Writing in the World again&s;t Sin, though never &s;o ele|gantly or &s;chola&s;tically wrote or delivered by the greate&s;t of Orators or Mini&s;ters, if, at the &s;ame Time, this Doctrine be upheld and maintained in Pulpits, Prints, and otherwi&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and received and believed by the People? Let Truth and right Rea&s;on in this Matter bear Rule and be Judge, and the Cau&s;e will be determined again&s;t the Kingdom of Sin and Satan: But the.
<Q>Kingdom of Chri&s;t is an Everla&s;ting King|dom, and of his Dominion there &s;hall never be an End.</Q>

of Chri&s;t to be faithful to the Commands of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Though the Devil is a great King, and a migh|ty Prince; tho' he is King over all the Children of Pride and Di&s;obedience, and Prince of the Power of the Air; yet "the Lamb and his Followers will have the Victory" over Sin and him, although &s;ometimes it may fare with them as with their Lord, who obtained it through Sufferings; and let it be remembered by them, <HI>that they &s;hall in the End reign with him</HI>; al&s;o, <HI>Fear not, little Flock,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>for it is your Father's good Plea&s;ure to give you a Kingdom</HI>; by which Words, when received in Faith, the Soul is in&s;pired with Courage, and holy Boldne&s;s, to re&s;i&s;t the Tempt|er; though we may have the Di&s;advantage of being but few, and Satan and his Followers many, who &s;up|port his Kingdom, with this &s;inful Principle and Doc|trine above-mentioned. One great and wily Way which he u&s;eth to uphold his Kingdom, is to wre&s;t and abu&s;e the Holy Scriptures, and &s;train them to his evil Purpo&s;es, as he &s;erved our Lord, the Captain of our Salvation, as will be &s;hewn hereafter: And indeed when he makes U&s;e of any of the Words of God, it is for an evil End, and that End mu&s;t needs be wicked, which is to keep People in Sin, or to create a Belief that we cannot live without it in this World; the which, if he can obtain, and cau&s;e People to believe, he knows he hath a great Advantage over them: For how &s;hould Clay, or Du&s;t and A&s;hes, overcome Sin, who confe&s;s they are, and believe they always &s;hall be, Sinners? Wherefore let us examine and &s;ee what U&s;e he makes of tho&s;e Scriptures, which he brings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;up|port People in Sin, and by which he makes them be|lieve they can never live without it; &s;ome of which are as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, Beginning with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ying of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Mat.</HI> xix. 17. to the young Man that a&s;ked him, <HI>What good Thing he &s;hould do to

To con&s;true Chri&s;t's Words other|wi&s;e, would be to abu&s;e the Holy Scriptures, which Satan makes a common Practice of doing.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Another is that Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Solomon,</HI> in the 8th Chapter of 1 <HI>Kings,</HI> Ver&s;e 46. <HI>There is no Man that &s;inneth not.</HI> The Learned &s;ay, this &s;hould be interpreted, and who may not &s;in. But though it may truly be &s;aid of Men in one Part of their Lives or other, or in the State of Man in the Fall or Degeneration (in which State of Unconver&s;ion) there is no Man that &s;inneth not: Yet in the Regeneration or new Birth, the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> in the 3d Chapter of his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, and 9th Ver&s;e, &s;aith, that <HI>Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth in him: And be cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God.</HI> It is this Seed which would beget this new and living Birth, which makes us Chil|dren of God, and Heirs of the Kingdom of Hea|ven, which Satan would de&s;troy; for he knows he &s;hall have an Enemy of every &s;uch Soul, and there|fore it is the Devil's Intere&s;t and Endeavour to de&s;troy every &s;uch Birth and &s;uch Belief, that Chri&s;tians can po&s;&s;ibly attain to live without Sin in the World.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly, Prov.</HI> 20th Chapter, 9th Ver&s;e, Who can &s;ay, <HI>I have made my Heart clean, I am pure from my Sin,</HI> the
<PB N="504" REF="006297_0515_10285BD825A613A8">
Words of <HI>Solomon,</HI> the Son of <HI>David,</HI> who prayed to the Almighty in his P&s;alms: <HI>Create in me a clean Heart, and renew a right,</HI> or pure <HI>Spirit within me</HI>; which Prayer was no doubt an&s;wered: But this is the Work of God, and to him all Things are po&s;&s;i|ble, even that which looks impo&s;&s;ible to Men; for <HI>He can make a Man more pure than Gold.</HI> So it being the Work of God, no Man can &s;ay, that he hath done it, that he hath purified him&s;elf, or made him|&s;elf clean. Can the Almighty make a Man pure? It might with much Truth be an&s;wered he can; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed no good Chri&s;tian can, or will deny it: And then what will become of that ab&s;urd Antichri|&s;tian and Anti&s;criptural Tenet, that we cannot be clean or pure from Sin, in this World?</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, if there are any who live without Sin, they are but very few (a &s;orrowful Truth indeed!) but is it not every One's Intere&s;t to &s;trive to be one of tho&s;e Few, as it is al&s;o his indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty: Our Lord al&s;o &s;aith, that <HI>the Way</HI> to his Kingdom <HI>is &s;trait and narrow, and</HI> that <HI>there are but few that find it.</HI> Mu&s;t we therefore give up the Cau&s;e, and not &s;eek the Kingdom, and becau&s;e of the Difficulty of Chri&s;t's Cro&s;s here in this World, mu&s;t we go in the broad Way, where there is much Room and Company. May every true Chri&s;tian &s;ay, the Lord forbid (I humbly pray) and not only &s;ay, but do that which is right in the Sight of God.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> The next is an Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s, Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, Chapter 7th, Ver&s;e 20. <HI>There is not a ju&s;t Man upon the Earth that doth Good, and &s;inneth not.</HI> This &s;hould be interpreted as the for|mer, <HI>and who may not &s;in:</HI> He &s;peaketh of a Man in the State of his Vanity and Sin, before a Reforma|tion; for Divine Wi&s;dom, and the Fear of the Lord (which he taught) keeps the Heart clean, and pre|&s;erves from the Snares of Sin, Death, and the Devil: So that this State of Sin that he here &s;peaks of, mu&s;t be before Man attains to the Wi&s;dom of God, and be|fore
<PB N="505" REF="006297_0516_10285BDB2AA6DE78">
he comes truly to live in his Fear. Therefore he mu&s;t certainly do Good, who lives in the Fear of God,
<Q>which (as the &s;ame <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays) is the Be|ginning of Wi&s;dom; and to depart from Iniquity, is a good Under&s;tanding.</Q>
So that he &s;hews Man his State of Vanity, and al&s;o his State of Sin, as above, and teacheth People how to avoid it, by fearing the Lord, and walking in the Coun&s;el of Wi&s;dom (<HI>i. e.</HI>) Chri&s;t's Coun&s;el, who is the Wi&s;dom of God to Salvation. That all Men are Sinners, before the Work of Con|ver&s;ion, is true, and that the Devil de&s;igns to keep them there to their Lives End, is as true; and no likelier Way can he do it, than by keeping them in a Belief that they mu&s;t live in Sin, and cannot live with|out it whil&s;t they live in this World; and when they come to die, then Fear &s;urpri&s;es the Hypocrite, and Terror takes hold of the Ungodly: And many times, when too late, they &s;ee the Snares which the Devil and Sin hath brought them into. Oh! what pity it is, that this Veil of Darkne&s;s is not done away, in time of Youth, Strength, and Health, when the Bones are full of Marrow, and the Veins are full of Blood: But the De&s;ign of Satan is to lead People on in this pernicious Principle till Death, and then before they are aware, they may drop into Eternal Woe and Mi&s;ery, where the Wicked and Ungodly mu&s;t be turned, with all them that forget God: For into Hea|ven, where Chri&s;t is, "if we die in our Sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 8.21.</NOTE> we (as Chri&s;t &s;aid) cannot come."</P>

Thus we &s;ee how Satan is put to his Shifts to &s;upport his &s;inful Kingdom, and how he abu&s;es the Holy Scriptures, when he makes u&s;e of them, as will be further made manife&s;t in what fol|]ows, as the &s;ame Apo&s;tle doth plainly demon&s;trate in his third Chapter of the above Epi&s;tle, Ver&s;es 7, 8, 9, and 10, &s;aying, <HI>Let no Man</HI> (nor the Devil nei|ther, &s;ay I) <HI>deceive you: He that doth Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is righteous: He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil.</HI> This is plain and naked Truth, let who will like, or di&s;like it. Further, in the 9th and 10th Ver&s;es he again repeats to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, &s;aying, <HI>In this the Children of God are manife&s;t, and the Children of the Devil: Who&s;oever doth not Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is not of God. (Ergo,</HI> then he mu&s;t be of the Devil, while he is in Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.)</P>
<P>There are divers other Places in the Holy Scriptures, which he abu&s;eth in like Manner, and which he and his Children wre&s;t to uphold him and his Kingdom of Sin and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and

them&s;elves therein: So by and through the Grace of God, we may &s;ee his Wiles and Delu&s;ions, and the Rottenne&s;s of his Cau&s;e, as al&s;o the un&s;afe and dange|rous Foundation of his Building, through endeavour|ing unduly to &s;upport the &s;ame, by that which was always de&s;igned to de&s;troy him and his Kingdom <HI>(i. e.)</HI> the Holy Scriptures. May all Men judge in this Mat|ter, whether that Spirit which would bring, pick, and cull out a few Ver&s;es, and &s;ometimes a few Words out of a Ver&s;e, in order to make them &s;peak contrary to the whole Scope and Tenor, or Tendency of the Ho|ly Scriptures, and to plant a Belief that we &s;hall never overcome Sin and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in this World, tho' they <HI>(i. e.)</HI> the Holy Scriptures all along exhort, and teach us to avoid Sin and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and live a holy righteous Life in this pre&s;ent World; I &s;ay, may all Mortals judge whether &s;uch a Spirit can be of God, or whether it be not of, and from the Father of Lies: Wherefore, if it be plainly proved, that there have been tho&s;e who have overcome Sin and Satan, and that Chri&s;t repeatedly, and his holy Apo&s;tles (he in them, and they in him) exhorted to fight again&s;t Sin and the Devil, who is the Author of all Sin; and Chri&s;t faithfully promi&s;ing mo&s;t &s;weet and gracious Rewards to tho&s;e who &s;hall overcome, in order to encourage the &s;piritual Warrior to a faithful Per&s;everance, and re&s;i&s;ting of Sin and Satan: Then it is hoped that Satan will be wounded, his Kingdom &s;haken, and this evil de&s;tructive Principle, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure laid wa&s;te in &s;ome poor Soul or Souls, into who&s;e Hands the&s;e may come.</P>

Oh! that our young Men of this Generation, would take tho&s;e young Men for their Examples, to make War with this wicked One, and truly endeavour to pull down his Kingdom. It is worth our Notice, that tho&s;e young Men had the Word of God abiding in them; by this Sword of the Spirit they overcame, by it they were clean&s;ed, by taking heed to walk accord|ing to its Directions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.9.</NOTE> as it is written, <HI>Wherewith &s;hall a young Man clean&s;e his Ways?

So here were young Men who ac|tually overcame Sin and Satan, that this holy Servant of Je&s;us wrote to, by way of Encouragement. Is the Arm of the Lord &s;hortned?

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us, Rev.</HI> ii. 7. <HI>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith unto the Churches, to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the Mid&s;t of the Paradi&s;e of God.</HI> Here is an excellent Promi&s;e and ble&s;&s;ed Encou|ragement to &s;uch as believe, and are faithful, and are de&s;irous to fight in the Lamb's War again&s;t Sin and Satan: The &s;ame Apo&s;tle gives a De&s;cription of this Tree of Life, in the above&s;aid Book; "That it bears twelve Manner of Fruits, and bears its Fruits every Month, and its Leaves are for the healing of the Na|tions;" which my&s;tically points at Chri&s;t, who is faith|ful in his precious Promi&s;es and Doctrine, and has that Virtue in him, that, through Faith, will heal the Na|tions of their Wounds which Sin has given them. Tho&s;e who continually eat of the Tree of Life, &s;hall live for ever; but a flaming Sword will turn every Way, to keep the unbelieving Sinners from it: None in a State of Sin and Di&s;obedience can come to enjoy the Paradi&s;e of God. The above is an excellent Pro|mi&s;e to all tho&s;e who overcome Sin, and the Devil, who is the Author of it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To the Church of <HI>Smyrna, Rev.</HI> ii. 11. <HI>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spi|rit &s;aith to the Churches, He that overcometh &s;hall not be hurt of the &s;econd Death:</HI> Which is that eternal Death which is in Hell, or that Lake of Fire which burns for ever, where the Worm never dieth, and the Fire never goeth out.

for Life, again&s;t eternal Death and Hell; which is of much greater Con&s;equence than natural Life and Death. Oh! Fight for your Lives again&s;t Sin and Sa|tan, again&s;t Pride and Vanity, and all Manner of Wickedne&s;s; put on the whole Armour of Light; look unto God, through Chri&s;t the victorious Lamb, that you may be &s;aved from the eternal Lake of Fire, and not be hurt of the &s;econd Death. Oh! may we know a dying daily to Sin, to the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil, that we may live unto God, through Faith in his dear Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> To the Church of <HI>Pergamus, Rev.</HI> ii. 17. <HI>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith to the Churches, To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna; and I will give him a white Stone, and in the Stone a new Name written, which no Man knoweth, &s;aving he that receiveth it.</HI> Here are four excellent Promi&s;es to him that overcometh, the Lord opens his Trea&s;ury of Life, and of Wi&s;dom, in order to invite Souls to the mighty Battle of the Lamb, who is not like the Princes of this World, who &s;ome|times promi&s;e great Things to their Soldiers or Fol|lowers, and do not perform; but God's Promi&s;es are all Yea and Amen for ever.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Promi&s;e is, <HI>to eat of the hidden Manna:</HI> The Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> eat Manna (outwardly) as it is written, in the Wilderne&s;s, and are dead; but tho&s;e who eat of this hidden Manna, this Angels-food, and who are hid with God in Chri&s;t, the&s;e &s;hall never die (<HI>i. e.</HI> &s;piritually) for this hidden Manna is the Fle&s;h and Blood of the Son of God, who &s;aid, <HI>Except ye eat my Fle&s;h, and drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you,</HI> John vi. 31, 49, 50, 51, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Second Promi&s;e is, <HI>to have a white Stone</HI>; this Stone is Chri&s;t, who is the chief Corner Stone of God's Building or Church, the <HI>New Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which the wi&s;e Letter-learned Ma&s;ter-builders &s;et at nought; but He is the Head of the Saints Building or Corner, and
<PB N="511" REF="006297_0522_10285BED138B95F8">
a Holy Precious Stone, the Elect or Cho&s;en of God, the Gift of God, to all tho&s;e who truly believe, and overcome Sin, as he did; and as it is written. <HI>If he give us his Son, &s;hall he not with his Son give us all Things?</HI> There is Abundance of Talk and Writing about the Philo&s;opher's Stone; but this <HI>White Stone</HI> (which is the Gift of God to tho&s;e who overcome Sin, and Satan) is the true Philo&s;opher's Stone. (A Philo&s;opher is a Lover of Wi&s;dom, and Chri&s;t is the Wi&s;dom of God:) This Stone will certainly do Miracles for them that have it, through the Virtue of its Power, it will pro|cure Joy in Tribulation, Patience in Afflictions, Health in Sickne&s;s, Riches in Poverty, Strength in Weakne&s;s, Liberty in Bonds, and to &s;um up all (which indeed is a great Sum) <HI>Life in Death.</HI></P>
<P>Third Promi&s;e, <HI>and in the Stone a new Name:</HI> How many gay Sparks and Beaus would do Abun|dance to gain Honour or a Name among Men? No|thing is dear to them in this World, neither their E|&s;tates, nor the neare&s;t Relation they have in the World, &s;o that they may gain a Name here below; no, not even their own Lives; but, Oh! did Mortals know the Virtue of this Name, and were they in Love with it, then the World, and all its fading Beauty and Vanity, would be nothing to them in Compari&s;on of this Name, which is better than the Names of Sons of worldly Glory, and Maids or Daughters of Honour; for tho&s;e outward Names are fading, <HI>viz.</HI> To-day a King, a Prince, a Duke, an Earl, a Lord, a Knight, and (has been, and may be again) To-morrow on the Scaffold: But this Name which the King of Kings giveth tho&s;e who overcome Sin and Satan, is a Name which will outla&s;t Time, and it will endure to Eter|nity.</P>
<P>Fourth Promi&s;e is, "That it &s;hould be &s;ecret (on|ly to the World) but &s;urely known to him that hath it." Great Men, when their Acts and Titles of Honour are blazoned abroad in the World, they have many
<PB N="512" REF="006297_0523_10285BEF2F0D6900">
Enemies many Ways, who envy them; and yet &s;ome are &s;o vain as to love Grandeur and Popularity, not|with&s;tanding; but he that hath a Name that Chri&s;t gives, &s;o long as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;en&s;ible of it in him&s;elf, he is therewith &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Now as this is the Portion (and more, which is hereafter mentioned) of tho&s;e who overcome the wick|ed One, then, on the contrary, what will become of tho&s;e who live and delight in Sin, and are daily over|come with it? For the Holy Scriptures are po&s;itive, That <HI>the Wicked, with all tho&s;e that forget God, &s;hall be turned into Hell.</HI> This is the determinate Will of God: And that we may take the more Notice of it, to ob&s;erve and do his Will, he hath cau&s;ed it to be written down in the Language of the Holy Spirit, in the Ho|ly Scriptures of Truth, which are of no private Inter|pretation; but naked, and open to mean Capacities. The Holy Scriptures are not to be interpreted to the private Intere&s;t of any particular Per&s;on or Sett of Per&s;ons only; but are a general Benefit unto all the faithful Believers and Followers of Chri&s;t, through the whole World.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> To the Church at <HI>Thyatira, Rev.</HI> ii. 26. to the End; <HI>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my Works unto the End, to him I will give Power over the Nations, and I will give him the Morning-&s;tar. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith unto the Churches.</HI> The Spirit &s;till continues promi&s;ing his gracious Privileges upon Condition of overcoming: Wherefore, if it had been impo&s;&s;ible to have overcome Sin and Satan, then all the&s;e Promi&s;es would have been in vain, and the Holy Scriptures deceiving, which would be to make Chri&s;t and the Apo&s;tles Deceivers; but Chri&s;t, his Apo&s;tles, and the Holy Scriptures, are true, and every One that contradicts God, is a Liar.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved, that there mu&s;t be a keeping the Word to the End al&s;o; for divers have run well for a Time, and overcome many Sins, through the
<PB N="513" REF="006297_0524_10285BF5434C5088">
Help and Goodne&s;s of God, and yet afterwards have run into Sin again, whereby they have grieved the good Spirit of God, by which they &s;hould have been &s;ealed to the Day of Redemption, and &s;o the Lord hath taken his good Spirit and Gift of Light and Grace from them, and left them to them&s;elves, and their own Hearts Lu&s;ts; but &s;uch as hold out in Well-doing to the End, the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;aved, and <HI>tho&s;e &s;hall have Power over the Nations</HI>; the Laws of Men, or Powers of the Earth or Hell, cannot hurt them; but they will be as Kings and Prie&s;ts unto God, ruling over their own Spirits; &s;uch an One is greater than one that ruleth a City, and cannot govern him&s;elf. Another excellent Gift is promi&s;ed here to the victori|ous Chri&s;tian Warrior, <HI>viz. I will give him the Morn|ing-&s;tar</HI>: 'Tis indeed a very comfortable Gift, to be|hold the Morning-&s;tar, after a long, tedious, &s;tormy Night, earne&s;tly waiting for the Morning: Oh! 'tis wonderful plea&s;ant. This Morning-&s;tar the Writer of the&s;e Lines hath witne&s;&s;ed, both as to his natural and &s;piritual Travels; but e&s;pecially to his inward State and Condition as a Chri&s;tian. Tho&s;e that have a true Sight and Sen&s;e of this Divine Star, are made to re|joice; for then they do infallibly know, that the Day of the Mo&s;t High is at Hand, and that his Kingdom draws near unto them. Amen, Holy Lord Je&s;us!</P>
<P>As the Day-&s;tar is a Fore-runner of the natural Day, &s;o is the heavenly Morning-&s;tar a Fore-runner of the Day of the Mo&s;t High to the Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> To the Church of <HI>Sardis, Rev.</HI> iii. 5. <HI>He that overcometh &s;hall be clothed in white Raiment, and I will not blot his Name out of the Book of Life; but I will confe&s;s him before my Father, and before his Angels. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith unto the Churches.</HI> The&s;e Promi&s;es of God, through his Spirit, and through his Servant, to the Church of <HI>Sardis,</HI> is, "That tho&s;e who overcome &s;hall be clothed in white Raiment;" and he &s;ays in the 4th
<PB N="514" REF="006297_0525_10285BF8D4B289C8">
Ver&s;e of the &s;ame Chapter, "That that Church had a Few in her who had not defiled their Garments, who &s;hould walk with him in White, for (&s;aith he) they are worthy." So that there were a Few undefiled Ones, who had overcome; although others were blameable, whom the Spirit reproved &s;harply; but al&s;o, as above, promi&s;ed that tho&s;e who overcame &s;hould be clothed in white Raiment; which Raiment is that clean Linnen called <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Saints,</HI> or el&s;ewhere, <HI>the Wedding Garment,</HI> and <HI>the Garment un&s;potted of the World,</HI> without having which, we may expect to be a&s;ked, how we dare to pre&s;ume to approach the Holy Pre&s;ence of a Ju&s;t and Righte|ous God, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity with Allowance or Approbation, as it is written, <HI>Friend, how came&s;t thou hither not having on the Wedding Gar|ment?</HI> And by the Promi&s;e to the Church, that tho&s;e who overcame, "their Names &s;hall not be blotted out of the Book of Life." It plainly appears, that tho&s;e who fight the Lamb's Battle, and overcome Sin and Satan, their Names are upon Record in Heaven, and written in the Lamb's Book of Life: It al&s;o appears, that we may have done well or valiantly in &s;ome Things, yet if we &s;uffer our&s;elves to be overcome of Sin, there is Danger, though our Names are in, we may have them blotted out of, the Book of Life.</P>
<P>Third Promi&s;e is very excellent and glorious, <HI>viz. But I will confe&s;s him before my Father, and before his Angels.</HI> Oh! wonderful Honour! to have Chri&s;t confe&s;s that we are his, and belong to him, and have been Men of Courage in this holy War, and overcame the Enemy, and been victorious in this Fight of Faith; to confe&s;s us there before God and his Angels, mu&s;t needs be un&s;peakable Honour done us before the Ar|mies in Heaven, He expre&s;&s;ed again his repeated Ad|vice to tho&s;e who have Ears, &s;aying, <HI>He that hath an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith to the Churches:</HI> Which is much wanting among Men, and al&s;o a be|lieving
<PB N="515" REF="006297_0526_10285BFCA54F0298">
Heart: I query, Is not God, Chri&s;t, and the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;tronger than the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil? But is not this Belief of it not being po&s;&s;i|ble to overcome Sin, and &s;aying, that we can't do it while we are here in this World; as much as to believe and &s;ay, that Satan and Nature is &s;tronger than God and Grace.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> To the Church at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the Spirit &s;aith, <HI>Rev.</HI> iii. 12, 13. <HI>Him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he &s;hall go no more out: And I will write upon him, the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith unto the Churches.</HI> Here is Promi&s;e upon Promi&s;e, all to per&s;uade, excite, and invite People to fight the Fight of Faith, believing they &s;hall obtain the Victory, and to de&s;troy the Principle of Unbelief: The Overcomer, through Grace, is to be made a Pillar in the Temple of God; that is, one of his Church, who helps to &s;upport the Credit of it, through a true Chri&s;tian Reputation in his Conver&s;ation. Such an One is a Pil|lar in the Church-militant here on Earth, and will, if he is faithful to the End, be al&s;o of the Church-tri|umphant in Heaven;
<Q>and he will not go out any more, but will abide in, and with Chri&s;t, for ever.</Q>
Here are Go&s;pel Promi&s;es and Privileges, happy are they who through Faith attain thereto: How much have Chri&s;tians need to be concern'd before God, for the excellent Gift of Faith, &s;ince
<Q>without Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</Q>
And as our Saviour &s;aith, <HI>If ye had Faith but as a Grain of Mu&s;tard-&s;eed, ye might &s;ay to this Mountain, be removed, and ca&s;t into the Sea, and it &s;hould be &s;o.</HI> Now though Sin indeed is grown a very great Mountain, in this Age and Gene|ration, yet through true Faith it is removed, accord|ing to the Doctrine of Chri&s;t (ble&s;&s;ed be his Holy Name.) Upon tho&s;e Overcomers, the Lord hath al&s;o promi&s;ed as above, to
<Q>write upon them the Name
<PB N="516" REF="006297_0527_10285BFE820E7D40">
of God, and the Name of the City of God, which is new <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which cometh down from Heaven, which is the Mother of all Saints.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 4.26.</NOTE></Q>
Here is a train of glorious Expre&s;&s;ions, and mighty Promi&s;es, e|nough to in&s;pire the tender Soul with &s;trong De&s;ires after God and Chri&s;t, and his Kingdom. My Heart is deeply affected at this Time, in the Sen&s;e of the Love of our heavenly Father; and my Spirit is great|ly concerned for the Welfare of the Children of Men, my Fellow Mortals. Oh! that they might believe, and that believing they might have life, through the Name of Chri&s;t. It is ob&s;ervable, that to overcome, is the Condition of obtaining all the&s;e great and glorious Promi&s;es; and Overcoming is repeated &s;even Times, once to every Chucrch. And to &s;ay after all tho&s;e glorious and fair Promi&s;es, that Sin and Satan cannot be overcome, is not the Con&s;equence of &s;uch Saying or Belief, to make Chri&s;t a Deceiver? Which is ab|&s;urd and Antichri&s;tian Doctrine.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> To the Church of <HI>Laodicea, Rev.</HI> iii. 21.22. <HI>To him that overcometh will I grant to &s;it with me in my Throne, even as I al&s;o overcame, and am &s;et down with my Father in his Throne. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith to the Churches.</HI> What greater Promi&s;e could Chri&s;t make to his Church than this, to take her into his Throne, and into his Father's Kingdom, into his Bo&s;om of Love? This is wonderful kind indeed. But then, Oh! Chri&s;tian, the Condition is to overcome, as Chri&s;t overcame.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince it may be beneficial to Chri&s;tians to under|&s;tand, and to con&s;ider duly, this great Fight or Battle, and how this great Conqueror overcame; and becau&s;e we are to follow him, and to take him for our Example, let us have a De&s;cription of it, it being the greate&s;t Encounter or Battle, that ever was in the World, be|tween the Prince of Life, and the King of the bottom|le&s;s Pit. The Hi&s;tory of which, is worth the Read|ing of the greate&s;t Prince or Monarch on Earth, &s;ince
<PB N="517" REF="006297_0528_10285C02DCDE4DF8">
they mu&s;t leave this low World, and lay down all their Crowns when Death calls, them to fight this Battle, and to follow this Monarch, who hath all Divine Power in Heaven and Earth, and to take his Direction, is every Man's Duty and Intere&s;t, both Noble and Ignoble. The holy Evangeli&s;ts, <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Luke,</HI> give us an Account of this great Fight, in the 4th Chapter of <HI>Mat|thew,</HI> and 4th Chapter of <HI>Luke,</HI> and agree in the mo&s;t weighty Matters, though they did not exactly word it alike, yet the Sub&s;tance is the &s;ame, and the Temptati|on, Conflict or Battle, all one. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Satan bids Chri&s;t (as <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Luke</HI> has it)
<Q>command the Stones, or Stone, to be made Bread. 2<HI>dly,</HI> To ca&s;t him&s;elf down from the Pinacle of the Temple. 3<HI>dly,</HI> To wor&s;hip the Devil, or fall down to him.</Q>
<HI>Matt.</HI> Chap. 4th, 1&s;t Ver&s;e, to the 11th. <HI>Then was Je&s;us led up of the Spirit into the Wilderne&s;s, to be tempted of the Devil. And when he had fa&s;ted forty Days and forty Nights, he was afterward an hungred. And when the Tempter came to him, he &s;aid, If thou be the Son of God, command that the&s;e Stones be made Bread. But he</HI> (i. e. Chri&s;t) <HI>an|&s;wered and &s;aid, it is written, Man &s;hall</HI> (or doth) <HI>not live by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God. Then the Devil taketh him up into the holy City, and &s;etteth him on a Pinacle of the Temple, and &s;aith unto him. If thou be the Son of God, ca&s;t thy&s;elf down: For it is written, He &s;hall give his Angels Charge concerning thee</HI> (it is ob&s;ervable that the Devil was here at his old Trade of perverting of the Holy Scriptures: The Scriptures &s;aying, that <HI>He &s;hall give his Angels Charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy Ways,</HI> &amp;c. as in the <HI>P&s;alms</HI>: Which Words Sa|tan left out, for they gave much Light to &s;ee his Temptation. tho&s;e Words which expo&s;ed him he hides, for he hates Light and Truth) <HI>and in their Hands they &s;hall bear thee up, le&s;t at any time thou da&s;h thy Foot again&s;t a Stone. Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, It is written again, Thou &s;halt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the Devil taketh him up into an exceeding high Mountain,
<PB N="518" REF="006297_0529_10285C046168FA80">
and &s;heweth him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them. And &s;aith unto him, All the&s;e Things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and wor&s;hip me. Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: For it is written, Thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve. Then the Devil leaveth him, and behold, Angels came and mini&s;tred unto him.</HI> Behold how the Saviour of the World overcame the Devil, and his Temptations. As he did, &s;o ought all Chri|&s;tians to re&s;i&s;t the Tempter, as it is written, <HI>Re&s;i&s;t the De|vil, and he'll fly:</HI> Here we may &s;ee he is a conquered Enemy; and we are told,
<Q>By Chri&s;t's Spirit we mu&s;t overcome, as he al&s;o overcame.</Q>
After our Lord had fa&s;ted forty Days, and forty Nights, he was hun|gry, at which Time the Devil urged him, if he was the Son of God, then to make the Stone or Stones Bread, knowing him to be hungry: Thus after the &s;ame Man|ner he tempts us poor Mortals, by laying his Snares, and baiting his Hook, according to the Nature and Propen&s;ity of the Per&s;on he is engaged withal: If a Man, Woman, or Child, be addicted to Pa&s;&s;ion, Pride, Swearing, Lying, Drunkenne&s;s, taking the &s;acred Name in vain, idle or vain Di&s;cour&s;es to &s;teal away our precious Time: Let the Sin be what it will, that which we are mo&s;t naturally addicted to, there will he lay his Temptations, for he preys upon our Weak|ne&s;s, and plies the weake&s;t Part in us mo&s;t; for which Rea&s;on, we have need to keep a &s;trict Watch: As Chri&s;t advi&s;ed to
<Q>watch and pray continually, left we &s;hould enter into Temptation;</Q>
for it is no Sin to be tempted, but the Sin is to entertain, and enter into the Temptati|on; if we overcome, as Chri&s;t did, it is an Honour to be tempted, and a &s;ecret Joy &s;prings in the Soul, in a Sen&s;e of its Victory, in &s;ore Conflicts between the Enemy and the Soul; the Lord manife&s;ting his Divine Grace for our A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Help. Here we can take the Advice of the Apo&s;tle, when he &s;ays, <HI>Count it all Joy when ye fall into divers Temptations</HI>; and al&s;o over|come them as Chri&s;t did, by Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="519" REF="006297_0530_10285C0614E5ABA0">If it be objected, though Chri&s;t overcame, yet I'm a poor &s;inful Creature, and have no Power; but he had and hath all Power, both in Heaven and Earth, committed into his Hands, &s;o that he might well overcome him. It is well if thou &s;ee&s;t thou ha&s;t no Power, and if thou al&s;o &s;ee&s;t that Chri&s;t hath wonderful Power; then &s;ince we have no Power of our&s;elves, we mu&s;t, by Prayer and humble Supplication, apply to him for it, in time of Need; believing, that he who hath made &s;o many encouraging Promi&s;es as are before recited, hath al&s;o Grace, and will give both Grace and Glory to tho&s;e who diligently &s;eek him: El&s;e why did he make &s;o many excellent Promi&s;es to the &s;piritual Warriors? This is worthy of the Notice of all, that Satan is a conquer|ed and limited Enemy and Adver&s;ary. 'Tis a &s;weet Portion of Go&s;pel Tidings, and good News, that the Devil cannot force any One whether he will or not in|to Sin; for if he could, no Fle&s;h could be &s;aved. As for In&s;tance, if a Man, Woman, or Child, were tempt|ed by Satan to tell a Lie, he cannot for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e thee to it again&s;t thy Will; &s;o that there mu&s;t be a cowardly giving Way, and falling from the Lamb's Standard, or En&s;ign, and going over to Satan, if Man is overcome of Sin and Wickedne&s;s: For if we &s;tand &s;tifly again&s;t him, although we be weak in our&s;elves, our great Ma&s;ter, who &s;eeth us in Secret, if we cry to Him for Help, will come to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, He whom Satan could never conquer; therefore it is &s;afe for all profe&s;&s;ing the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to keep near unto Him, through Faith in his Name and Power, which ever was, is, and will be, a &s;trong Tower to tho&s;e who fly thereto for Safety. Chri&s;t did not do as the Devil tempted him, or per&s;waded him to do; but he with|&s;tands the Temptation, with this Reply, <HI>It is written, Man lives not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God:</HI> For there is Life in every Word of God. Thus our Lord overcame him; for Satan can't re&s;i&s;t, &s;o as to make void, or

lay wa&s;te the Words of God in the Holy Scriptures of Truth, when they are bro't into our Minds by his Spirit to uphold and promote the Kingdom of God and Chri&s;t, and to de&s;troy the Kingdom of Sin and Satan; though he (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Devil) makes U&s;e of tho&s;e Sacred Writings, often wre&s;ting them, and bringing them for evil U&s;es, and wrong Purpo&s;es, as mo&s;t certainly he doth, when he alledgeth from them, that People can't live otherwi&s;e than in Sin.</P>
<P>"Then (as <HI>Matthew</HI> has it) he had our Lord to the Pinacle of the Temple, and bid him ca&s;t him&s;elf down; for, &s;ays Satan, it is written, he &s;hall give his Angels Charge concerning thee, left at any Time thou da&s;h thy Foot again&s;t a Stone." Though he was once overcome, yet he has the Boldne&s;s to tempt yet again: As Chri&s;t overcame him by his Power, making U&s;e of the Holy Scriptures, he now tries what he can do with the Scriptures, he tempts Chri&s;t with them, that he might tempt his Father; and &s;o he tempts poor Mor|tals by the Scriptures, to keep them in Sin, by making a wrong U&s;e of them, and mi&s;applying them; and if he can hold them in Sin, he knows 'tis the ready Way to cau&s;e the Almighty to be angry with them; and if they hold out in it to the End, to turn them at la&s;t in|to Hell, where the Wicked mu&s;t be turned. And he begins his Temptations with an, <HI>If thou be the Son of God,</HI> though he knew very well that he was the Son of God; yet like &s;ome of his evil Seed, or Seed of Evil|doers, tempted him to &s;hew a Sign; but our Lord did not gratify either him or them, but rebuked them both, as they well de&s;erved; and &s;o by Denial and Re&s;i|&s;tance he overcame, and we al&s;o mu&s;t the &s;ame Way. After this our Lord makes a true and right U&s;e of the Scriptures, &s;aying, <HI>It is written again, thou &s;halt not tempt the Lord thy God.</HI> And truly, tho&s;e who read the Holy Scriptures, and know how much they &s;peak again&s;t Sin, and for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and who yet not|with&s;tanding live in Sin and Ungodline&s;s, and plead for it even from the&s;e Sacred Writings, which were

wrote on purpo&s;e to de&s;troy Sin, &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;ider, whether they are not guilty of tempting of God, which Chri&s;t &s;ays it is written thou &s;halt not do. Oh! that People would turn away from Sin and Satan, and break off from their Sins by Repentance, and their Iniquities by Amendment of Life, which is the Way to have the Days of their Tranquility lengthened out in this World, and to be happy in that which is without End to come; for, as it is written, <HI>The Wicked do not live out Half their Days</HI>; which, according to my Ob|&s;ervation, is a true general Rule. How many have been taken off in their Prime and Strength, and in the Flower of their Years, who might, according to the Cour&s;e of Nature, have lived many Years, had they been &s;ober and temperate, and lived in the Fear of God? If it be a&s;ked, do not pious young People die al&s;o? Yes, but not &s;o frequently as intemperate Ones; I have had Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve it in divers Parts of the World; and be&s;ides, if pious young People leave this World, their Exchange is glorious; whereas the Wicked and Ungodly make a &s;ad and bitter Exchange; and &s;ince Life is &s;o uncertain, and Death &s;o &s;ure and certain to all, even to Male and Female, what Care and Fear ought there to be on all, of offending &s;o mer|ciful? God, and &s;o &s;weet a Saviour, who overcame, to &s;hew us the Way to overcome al&s;o; and died for Sin, that we might die to the World, and the &s;inful Part of it, and live to him, exhorting of us to over|come as he al&s;o did, and then promi&s;eth to take us for his Companions with him&s;elf, and his Father, in his heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P>Satan repeats his Temptation again a third Time; for he is an unwearied Enemy, and will tempt poor Mortals over and over, many Times; but he is to be re&s;i&s;ted as often as he tempts, if we will follow the Coun&s;el and Example of Chri&s;t; and this was his la&s;t Temptation for that Conflict, as one of the Evangeli&s;ts ob&s;erves, "he takes him up in|to an exceeding high Mountain, and &s;heweth him all

the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of it. A Temptation which takes with Abundance of Souls; the Glory, Riches, and Greatne&s;s of this World, ru|ins many, they having it, and being &s;well'd with Pride therein; &s;ome are de&s;troying them&s;elves to get it, and cannot attain to it; and many would endeavour to create a Belief of them&s;elves, that they are greater, richer, and more noble, than they really are, which is a Temptation of the Evil One; for we ought to think meanly of our&s;elves; and if we will follow Chri&s;t's Example, make our&s;elves of no Reputation; and when Satan would tempt us to be proud, or high of Mind, we then &s;hould re&s;i&s;t, as Chri&s;t did, who &s;aid to the Devil in this Temptation, <HI>Get thee behind me Satan, for it is written, Thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve.</HI> If this holy Rule was followed, as Chri&s;t in&s;tituted it, then we &s;hould over|come Sin and Satan: Chri&s;t's In&s;titution is, That <HI>the Hour cometh, and now is, that tho&s;e that wor&s;hip the Father, mu&s;t wor&s;hip Him in Spirit and in Truth.</HI> It is too much Wor&s;hip or Homage to fall down to or wor&s;hip Satan; but the Duty of every Chri&s;tian is to wor&s;hip the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, for he it is whom we &s;hould only <HI>(i. e.)</HI> chiefly, and mainly, &s;erve and wor&s;hip, and that not only in a formal Way, but with Hearts truly devoted to do his Will; we are to wor&s;hip the Father in Spirit and in Truth, into which the Devil can never come; though he may get into the Form of it, he can't overcome us, where the Power of Chri&s;t is lived in; for by the Power of God, which dwells in Chri&s;t, who overcame, by the &s;ame Power, Chri&s;tians do and &s;hould overcome: So the Devil was forced to fly when Chri&s;t re&s;i&s;ted him, and &s;o he will when Chri&s;tians re&s;i&s;t him in Chri&s;t: And when Chri&s;t had overcome, then the Angels came and mini&s;tred unto him; likewi&s;e the Guardian Angel of God's holy Pre&s;ence will admini&s;ter &s;weet Comfort and Plea&s;ure to every true Soul, who &s;tands truly for the

Truth for ever: Nor do we read or under&s;tand of a|ny Alteration thereof by Chri&s;t: Indeed the Mini&s;ters of Antichri&s;t have made an Alteration (contrary to this Doctrine of his) in their Mini&s;try; but the Holy Apo&s;tles, who after Chri&s;t were the fir&s;t Planters of Chri&s;tianity in the Earth, when it &s;hone in its primi|tive Beauty and Glory, they followed the Coun&s;el of their Lord and Ma&s;ter, and mini&s;tred freely: Then was the Power of Chri&s;t's Mini&s;try and Go&s;pel through his Mini&s;ters and Servants great, and the Glory and Beauty thereof ravi&s;hing to pious Souls. Oh! may every true Mini&s;ter, and every &s;en&s;ible Soul, bow be|fore the Mo&s;t High, and ble&s;s the Holy Name of Him that lives and reigns for ever, for this un&s;peakable Gift of Chri&s;t's Holy Mini&s;try, which always was, now is, and ever will be, convincing and converting unto Souls, who are not &s;low of Heart to believe in God, and in his dear Son, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is our great High Prie&s;t, and the Bi&s;hop of Souls; he &s;aw the Need that his Church had of this his Mini&s;try, and therefore he e&s;tabli&s;hed it in his Church, and among his Followers, to the End of Time.</P>

This indeed is a great Point, and highly nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;earched into, which is to be known by our Lord's Rule, which he has pre&s;cribed for that End. <HI>Do Men</HI> (&s;aith He) <HI>gather Grapes off Thorns, or Figs off Thi|&s;tles?</HI> (Surely No. The Grape is gathered from the Vine, and the Fig from the Fig-tree.) <HI>Wherefore by their Fruits ye &s;hall knew them.</HI> Now tho&s;e (according to this true Rule) who have the Spirit, or Holy Gho&s;t, they bring forth the Fruits of it: <HI>Which Fruits are Love, Charity, Meekne&s;s, Temperance, Patience, Expe|rience, Hope, Faith, and Wi&s;dom from above, which is pure and peaceable, gentle and ea&s;y to be intreated,</HI> to all, and every Thing that is Good. And tho&s;e who have the Holy Spirit, bring forth the Fruits of it as naturally, as the Vine doth the Grape, and the Fig-Tree the Fig. Al&s;o, <HI>What&s;oever Things are holy, ju&s;t, hone&s;t, pure, and of good Report,</HI> or tends to Piety, or Virtue; in a Word, every Thing that is Good, is

the Fruit of the Spirit of God and Chri&s;t: And they are brought forth with Divine Life and Power in that Mini&s;ter and People, who through true Faith in the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, have received the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, or Spirit of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel being thus fitly furni&s;h|ed to every good Word and Work, he is ready to an&s;wer the Call of his great Lord and Holy Ma&s;ter, which is in Heaven; he wants not the Call of Man, nor Authority from Man, nor Wages of Man. But tho&s;e who bring forth Fruits contrary to the above, can neither be true Mini&s;ter, nor Chri&s;tians, accord|ing to the Doctrine of our Holy Lord. Being thus qualified by the Mo&s;t High, tho&s;e Mini&s;ters are freely given up to &s;erve the Lord, and go where&s;oever he is plea&s;ed to &s;end them, though he &s;end them as Lambs among Wolves: And it is worth noting, that Chri&s;t's Me&s;&s;engers and Mini&s;ters are called and &s;ent of him; they do not run of them&s;elves, nor in their own Will; which if they did, their End would be like the forward fal&s;e Prophets of old, who did not profit the People at all.</P>
<P>Our great Lord &s;eeing what Need the World had of true Teaching, and of true Teachers, &s;ends his Mini&s;ters forth into it, &s;aying. <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 18, 19, 20. <HI>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth: Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t: Teaching them to ob&s;erve all Things what&s;oever I have commanded you: And lo, I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World.</HI></P>
<P>Many of his excellent Sayings and Commands may be found in that wonderful Sermon which he preached on the Mount, <HI>Matt.</HI> 5th, 6th, and 7th Chapters.</P>
<P>Here Chri&s;t &s;hews has Mini&s;ters his Power, and &s;ends them forth in his own Name, for there is none other given under Heaven for Salvation; and Chri&s;t comforts his Mini&s;ters with a glorious Promi&s;e, of be|ing

<P>Chri&s;t &s;ends his Mini&s;ters into the World, in order to propagate his Go&s;pel of Salvation, and to let the World know that he is come to put an End to Sin, and bring Life and Peace to the Soul, according to the Angels Te&s;timony of him, that <HI>his Name &s;hould be cal|led Je&s;us</HI> (which is a Saviour) <HI>for he &s;hall &s;ave his Peo|ple from their Sins,</HI> Matt, i. 21.

<P>Surely that Soul who cannot by all this &s;ee that there is an Overcoming, mu&s;t certainly be blind as to a &s;piri|tual Sight of the Doctrine of Chri&s;t; and what is it but to make Chri&s;t and the Holy Spirit a Deceiver, to promi&s;e all tho&s;e great Things to his Churches, if they cannot perform the Conditions He pre&s;cribes; and if it were true (as it is not) that it is impo&s;&s;ible to over|come Sin and Satan, then would Chri&s;t be a hard Ma|&s;ter, which is ab&s;urd and wicked to &s;ugge&s;t. But this Overcoming mu&s;t not be in our own Wills, nor in our own Time, nor with our own Weapons, but accord|ing to the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI>'s Te&s;timony of the Saints Weapons, and their Warfare, and al&s;o of his own Fight and Victory, <HI>viz.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 4. <HI>The Weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of &s;trong Holds</HI> (Satan's Holds of Sin are &s;trong Ones, if never to be overcome.)</P>
<P><PB N="535" REF="006297_0546_10285C33DD4C9470">But with the&s;e Weapons we may overcome: And He bids the Chri&s;tian put them on, and calls them the whole Armour of Light (oppo&s;ite and contrary to Sa|tan's dark Power) and he names them after this Man|ner: <HI>Stand therefore, having your Loins girt about with Truth, and having on the Brea&s;t-plate of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and your Feet &s;hod with the Preparation of the Go&s;pel of Peace; above all, taking the Shield of Faith, where|with ye &s;hall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked, and take the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,</HI> Eph. vi. 13&mdash;17.</P>

<P>Thus the Saints and primitive Chri&s;tians were vic|torious in this Chri&s;tian and Spiritual Warfare, and they encouraged others to follow them, as they did Chri&s;t.

Hereby it is plain he thought there was no ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of outward Learning, nor outward Call by Man.</P>
<P>And as there is no ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of outward Learning to make a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, &s;o there is no Need to force an outward Maintenance; for Chri&s;t will take Care of his Servants, and feed and clothe them, when he &s;ends them, as he did his Di&s;ciples, who went forth <HI>without Staff or Scrip,</HI> yet acknowledged; after their Return, <HI>they lacked nothing.</HI> And as Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Freely ye have received, freely give</HI>; &s;o there is no outward Compul&s;ion or Force in Chri&s;t's Doctrine or Religion: Some are indeed of another Opinion, and have practized the contrary, and bring tho&s;e Words of Chri&s;t to uphold them in the Practice of forcing Reli|gion, where he &s;ays, in the Parable of the Marriage Supper, <HI>Go, compel them to come in</HI>; which was no other Compul&s;ion or Force but that of Love, which is the greate&s;t Power in Heaven or Earth; to con&s;true our Saviour's Words in any other Sen&s;e, would be ab|&s;urd, and contrary to the whole tenor of his Doctrine and glorious Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Thus then the Work of Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters is to bring the People to Chri&s;t, as He is their Redeem|er and Saviour from Sin, and as He is their Comforter, and good Remembrancer, and their &s;pi|ritual Guide into all Truth, in the Performance of which Work, they will have their Reward in this World, and in the World to come everla&s;ting Life. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

This he wrote when he was illu&s;trating the invincible and mighty Power of Faith, by the many wonderful Works that had been done thereby; and doubtle&s;s the Faith there &s;poken of, is the true Faith; and whatever is foretold in and through true Faith will mo&s;t certainly be fulfilled, as this great and &s;ignificant Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>I&s;aac</HI> to his Sons was: The good, old Man, calls his elde&s;t Son to him, being di&s;po&s;ed to ble&s;s him, and bids him &s;eek Veni&s;on, and make him Savoury Meat, <HI>Gen.</HI> xxvii. 3.4. (&s;uch as he knew his Father loved) that my Soul may ble&s;s thee before I die; and <HI>Rebecca</HI> their Mother knowing (from what God had &s;hewed her before they were born) that the Elder &s;hould &s;erve the Younger, <HI>Gen.</HI> xxv. 23. for whom &s;he had al&s;o the greate&s;t Love; &s;he calls <HI>Jacob</HI> and opens the Matter to him, and bids him get Savoury Meat for his Father, <HI>Gen.</HI> xxvii. 14, 17, 18. which, through her Importunity, he did, and after he had prepared it, he brought it to his Father before his Brother came, and his Father ble&s;&s;ed him in Faith, Ver&s;e 28; but he did it again&s;t his natural Inclination; for he would have had his Son <HI>E|&s;au</HI> to have had the Ble&s;&s;ing of Preference, Ver&s;es 24, 25, becau&s;e he was the elde&s;t Son, and by Nature it was his Birth-right; but he, in his prophane State and Condition, had de&s;pi&s;ed and &s;old it for a Thing of little Value to his Brother <HI>Jacob</HI>; &s;o that <HI>Jacob,</HI> hav|ing,
<PB N="540" REF="006297_0551_10285C43DD9F82E8">
by his Brother's Con&s;ent, bought it of him, had a Right to it on a double Account, both by Promi&s;e and Purcha&s;e. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> By the Promi&s;e of God before he was born: And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> By Purcha&s;e of his Bro|ther. But pray let it be ob&s;erved, that this was the Ble&s;&s;ing of Preference only, that Ble&s;&s;ing which <HI>E&s;au</HI> &s;ought with Tears, but could not find it; neverthe|le&s;s he had a Ble&s;&s;ing pronounced to him by his Father, through Faith, Chap, xxvii. 39. though he does not &s;eem to have had a right Sen&s;e thereof, for he was at Times in a prophane Spirit, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 16, 17. and in Enmity and Malice again&s;t his Brother <HI>Jacob,</HI> as ap|pears by that murthering, per&s;ecuting Mind, that then was unmortified in him; <HI>for,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the Days of Mourning for my Father are at Hand, and then I will &s;lay my Brother</HI> Jacob, <HI>Gen.</HI> xxvii. 41. But then, as his Wickedne&s;s was great, his Conver&s;ion mu&s;t be by &s;o much the more glorious. It would be well if all murdering Per&s;ecutors would (in this his Conver&s;ion) take him for an Example; for in&s;tead of killing his Brother <HI>Jacob,</HI> when he met him on his Return to his Father's Hou&s;e (from whence he had fled) he fell on his Neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him, and wept, <HI>Gen.</HI> xxxiii. 4.</P>
<P>It is hoped that no Chri&s;tian Ear will be offended to hear of the Conver&s;ion and great Change of this pro|phane Per&s;on, who, though he was not favoured with the Ble&s;&s;ing of Preference, or the natural Ble&s;&s;ing of Birth-right (which he &s;ought with Tears, and could not find, <HI>Gen.</HI> xxvii. 38.) yet the Ble&s;&s;ing of God's Grace and Favour (being the free Gift of the Almighty to him) with the Fatne&s;s of the Earth, he had, and it was delivered to him by his Father by Faith, as &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, in the fore-cited Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Chap. xi. 20.</P>
<P>Which Ble&s;&s;ing was by their Father <HI>I&s;aac</HI> thus ex|pre&s;&s;ed to each of them. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> to <HI>Jacob, that the Pur|po&s;e of God according to Election might &s;tand,</HI> Rom. ix. 11, 12. which Choice, or Election, before they were
<PB N="541" REF="006297_0552_10285C45639FB488">
born, or had done Good or Evil, was, <HI>that the Elder &s;hould &s;erve the Younger,</HI> or the Younger be preferred before the Elder; not that one &s;hould be damned, and the other &s;aved; there is no Damnation to Eternity that we read of concerning <HI>E&s;au,</HI> but a choice Ble&s;&s;ing of God, of a quite different Nature. Unto <HI>Jacob</HI> he &s;aid thus; <HI>God give thee of the Dew of Heaven, and the Fatne&s;s of the Earth, and Plenty of Corn and Wine, be Lord over thy Brethren, and let thy Mother's Sons bow down to thee,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Gen.</HI> xxvii. 28, 29. And, 2<HI>dly,</HI> Unto <HI>E&s;au</HI> he &s;ays (exceedingly trembling) Ver&s;e 33. <HI>Behold thy Dwelling &s;hall be of the Fatne&s;s of the Earth, and of the Dew of Heaven from above, and by thy Sword &s;halt thou live, and &s;halt &s;erve thy Brother; and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, when thou &s;halt have the Dominion, that thou &s;halt break his Yoke from off thy Neck,</HI> Ver&s;es 39, 40.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings have not only Re&s;pect to their own proper Per&s;ons, but al&s;o to their Po&s;terity; but far from pre-ordaining them, or any of them, to Damna|tion; and we have good Ground to believe, from (what is above, together with) the Reformation wrought in <HI>E|&s;au</HI> him&s;elf, much better Things of him; for it is written, <HI>When the wicked Man turneth away from his Wickedne&s;s which he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he &s;hall &s;ave his Soul alive,</HI> Ezek. xviii. 27. <HI>So when a righteous Man turneth away from his Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and committeth Iniquity, and dieth in them, for his Iniquity which he hath done &s;hall he die,</HI> Ver&s;e 26.</P>
<P>Having thus far taken Notice of the Purport of the Ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>E&s;au,</HI> relating to their Per&s;ons; who were both ble&s;&s;ed with the Dew of Heaven, and the Fatne&s;s of the Earth, I would add this Remark, "Let none cur&s;e him or them whom God hath ble&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>And whereas the Apo&s;tle, reciting the Words of the Prophet <HI>Malachi,</HI> &s;aith, Jacob <HI>have I loved, but</HI> E&s;au <HI>have I hated,</HI> Rom. ix. 13. This was not &s;aid of them before they were born, or had done either Good or E|vil;
<PB N="542" REF="006297_0553_10285C4814A1BD00">
but was ju&s;tly denounced by the Almighty for the Cruelty and Hatred of the Children of <HI>E&s;au</HI> to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as is fully and clearly expre&s;&s;ed by the Prophets, <HI>David, Ezekiel, Amos,</HI> and <HI>Obadiah; P&s;alm</HI> cxxxvii. 7. <HI>Ezekiel</HI> xxv. 15. xxxv. 1&mdash;15. xxxvi. 5. <HI>Amos</HI> i. 11, 12. <HI>Obadiah</HI> 10, to 16. and was written many Ages after.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The next Text under Con&s;ideration is, "that the Lord hardened the Heart of <HI>Pharaoh," Exod.</HI> vii. 13. But it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, he had fir&s;t harden|ed him&s;elf again&s;t God and his People, and then God hardened him yet harder, in order to &s;hew his great Power to Mortals, which well con&s;i&s;ted with his Ju|&s;tice to the Wicked and Unmerciful; for as God is mer|ciful to the Righteous, &s;o He is Ju&s;t in his Judgment to the Ungodly.</P>
<P>So that God was clear of that evil Heart of Un|belief in him, and it is but ju&s;t, and al&s;o rea&s;onable, that when Man, having been often vi&s;ited, refu&s;eth the Offers of God's Love, that He &s;hould vi&s;it &s;uch in and with his righteous Judgment (who have &s;lighted his Mercy and Grace) And then, according to Holy Scripture,
<Q>his De&s;truction is of him&s;elf, but his Help is in the Lord,</Q>
<HI>Ho&s;.</HI> xiii. 9. So that
<Q>God is true, and and every Man, contradicting him, is a Liar,</Q>
<HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 4.</P>
<P>Wherefore may all have a Care of hardening of their Hearts as <HI>Pharaoh</HI> did, for that is provoking to the Almighty, and then He ju&s;tly gives them over to an evil Heart of Unbelief, and to a reprobate Mind, and &s;o they depart from the living God. The Lord &s;aid unto <HI>Pharaoh, let my People go,</HI> over and over, and it was the Mind of God he &s;hould have done it: With|out tho&s;e Men who hold the contrary, would make the Almighty &s;uch an one as them&s;elves, to &s;ay one Thing, and mean another. What is that but to charge the Almighty with Hypocri&s;y? A Thing hated of him, and his Dear Son, Chri&s;t Je&s;us. No, no, <HI>Pharaoh</HI>
<PB N="543" REF="006297_0554_10285C49AD57CDA8">
might have obeyed the Lord in a Day of Vi&s;itation: But he refu&s;ed, and &s;aid, <HI>Who is the Lord, that I &s;hould obey his Voice, to let I&s;rael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let I&s;rael go,</HI> Exod. v. 2. And he con|tinued to harden him&s;elf again&s;t God, and his People, cruelly per&s;ecuting them, and forcing them to make Brick without Straw, before we read that the Lord hardened his Heart. Oh! that all hard heared, per|&s;ecuting, unbelieving People, might take Warning by him in time, before it be too late.</P>
<P>It is clear, he might have let the People Go; be|cau&s;e God by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> commanded him &s;o to do. And who can deny, that what God did, was more proper to &s;often, than to harden his Heart, by letting him &s;ee the Miracles wrought in his Name, and the Cea&s;ing of the Plagues he had inflicted; therefore it was po&s;&s;ible for him to have done what God required of him; he was not prede&s;tinated to that Obduration, until he had hardened his own Heart; and then it was, is, and al|ways will be, ju&s;t with God to &s;uffer his, or any other Man's Heart to become hardened, and give them up to a reprobate Mind, <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 29.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The following Scripture is wre&s;ted, and fal&s;ly made u&s;e of, viz. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxvii. 11. <HI>He that made them, will not have Mercy on them; and He that form|ed them, will &s;hew them no Favour.</HI> This Text hath, in &s;ome of the Writings of tho&s;e that e&s;pou&s;e the afore|&s;aid Doctrine, been brought to vindicate that de&s;pair|ing, de&s;tructive, evil Principle, of Pre-ordination of particular Per&s;ons to De&s;truction and Damnation: But this Text, with the re&s;t, brought for that End, is gro&s;ly perverted; for in the &s;ame Place the Ca&s;e is fairly &s;tated, and the Rea&s;on clearly &s;hewn, why God will &s;hew them no Favour, <HI>viz.</HI> "Becau&s;e they were withered Branches, and People of no Under&s;tanding; therefore he that made them, would not have Mercy upon them, and he that formed them, would &s;hew them no Favour." From whence it appears, they might have
<PB N="544" REF="006297_0555_10285C4C32A024E0">
been fruitful, but would not, and had been green, but were withered from their Greenne&s;s; much like tho&s;e who Chri&s;t expo&s;tulates with, when He &s;ays, <HI>How often would I have gathered you as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not,</HI> Matt. xxiii. 37. <HI>If thou bad&s;t known in this thy Day, the Things which be|long to thy Peace, but now they are bid from thine Eyes,</HI> Luke xix. 42. Which &s;hews the great and fervent De&s;ire of Chri&s;t to &s;ave Souls, and his tender Love to poor Mortals, and that they had a Day of Vi&s;itation, in which they might have been gathered, which is far from ordaining them to De&s;truction from all Eternity.</P>
<P>So that God is fully clear of all Men, and their Blood is on their own Heads, and their De&s;truction is of them&s;elves; whereas they might have Help in the Lord, and his Chri&s;t, through Faith, which he offers to Man freely; but Man will not receive or embrace it. And further, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that if the whole Texts of the Prophecy of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> in his 37th Chapter be con&s;idered, it will plainly appear, that he is &s;o far from uttering an expre&s;s or po&s;itive Decree of their final De&s;truction, that he clearly and fully foretels their Recovery and Re&s;toration out of that State.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> They argue from the Words of the Apo|&s;tle, <HI>Hath not the Potter Power over the Clay, to make of the &s;ame Lump one Ve&s;&s;el to Honour, and another to Di&s;honour?</HI> Rom. ix. 21. Yes, doubtle&s;s he hath; but the Potter doth not make Ve&s;&s;els with De&s;ign to de&s;troy them, or to break them to Pieces, but for U&s;e and Service; and it is contrary to his Will and Inte|re&s;t, when any Ve&s;&s;el marrs under his Hand. And it is very plainly expre&s;&s;ed by the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> after mentioning his beholding the Work of the Pot|ter, in the 18th Chapter, 6th, 7th, and 8th Ver&s;es, <HI>O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, cannot I do with you as this Potter? &s;aith the Lord? Behold as the Clay is in the Potter's Hand, &s;o are ye in mine Hand, O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael. At what In&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a Nation, and con|cerning
<PB N="545" REF="006297_0556_10285C52A44D26E0">
a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it: If that Nation again&s;t whom I have pro|nounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</HI> All which is contrary to the Doctrine of an ab&s;olute, unconditional Prede&s;tination: The Lord, in his Wi&s;dom, and to &s;hew his Power, doth make Souls more or le&s;s honourable, as he plea&s;eth; but it is very plain, from Scripture, and right Rea&s;on, that He makes none with De&s;ign to de&s;troy them, or hath ordained any to eternal Damnation. Though He hath ordained Damnation for wicked and ungodly Men, yet he never ordained that Men &s;hould be wicked and un|godly.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> They urge the Apo&s;tle's Words, but to as little Purpo&s;e as the former, <HI>Rom</HI> ix. 18. <HI>He will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will be hardeneth.</HI> 'Tis true, that God hath abundantly &s;hewn us in the Holy Scriptures on whom He will have Mercy, <HI>viz.</HI> He hath Mercy on the Poor in Spirit; the Humble He teaches of his Ways; the Meek He guides in Judgment; He clothes the Meek with Salva|tion: He hath the Righteous in everla&s;ting Remem|brance; He loveth them which love him; He &s;aveth them who love his Dear Son, and believe in him; He giveth to them eternal Life, and Chri&s;t loveth them, and manife&s;teth him&s;elf unto them. And his beloved Di&s;ciple <HI>John</HI> declared, <HI>If any Man &s;in, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the Sins of the whole World,</HI> 1 John ii. 1, 2. And the Author of the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> &s;aith, <HI>But we &s;ee Je&s;us, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the Suffering of Death, crowned with Glory and Honour, that he, by the Grace of God, &s;hould ta&s;te Death for every Man,</HI> Heb. ii. 9. And all who believe in, and obey him, will partake of the Benefit of his Death and Suffering; <HI>but the
<PB N="546" REF="006297_0557_10285C542B19DFE0">
Wicked is &s;nared in the Work of his own Hands,</HI> P&s;al. ix. 16.</P>
<P>Thus it was in my Mind, and hath been, for &s;ome Years, to &s;hew to the Pre&s;byterian, Independent, or Bapti&s;t People, or any other, who hold the Doctrine of particular per&s;onal Election or Reprobation, the Weakne&s;s of &s;ome of (what they call; their Proofs, for this (as I take it) corrupt and dangerous Doctrine of theirs, and the Mi&s;application of tho&s;e Texts of Scripture, which they advance to maintain their ab&s;urd Notion, of Souls being fore-ordained to Damnation eternally, whether they do Good or Evil, and that it is &s;o determined, before we are born into the World, Oh! that tho&s;e People might come to true Repent|ance, and lay hold of the univer&s;al Love of God to eternal Life, through the living Faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, in the tender Bowels of who&s;e Love to all are tho&s;e Lines written, and in great Love and Good|will they are invited to &s;earch the Scriptures, and to &s;ee whether the whole Scope of them do not &s;hew the contrary to what they hold in Relation to per&s;onal Re|probation to De&s;truction, fore-ordained before we are born, or have done either Good or Evil; there not being one Text to be found to prove that Doctrine: But there are abundance which &s;et forth the Love, Mercy, and Goodne&s;s of God, to Mankind; only two of which I &s;hall add hereunto, <HI>viz. And God &s;aw that the Wickedne&s;s of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only Evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made Man on the Earth, and it grieved him at his Heart,</HI> Gen. vi. 5, 6. <HI>And Jonah aro&s;e, and went unto Nine|veh, according to the Word of the Lord, and entered, and &s;aid, Yet forty Days, and Nineveh &s;hall be overthrown. So the People of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a Fa&s;t, and put on Sackcloth, from the greate&s;t of them, even to the lea&s;t of them. And God &s;aw their Works, that they returned from their evil Way, and God repented of the

Evil that he had &s;aid he would do unto them, and be did it not,</HI> Jonah iii. 3, 4, 5, 10. I heartily de&s;ire that the&s;e two Texts may be duly con&s;idered, and weighed, therein the Mercy, Loving-kindne&s;s, and long For|bearance of God, being &s;o clearly and fully manife&s;t|ed, that I think may be &s;ufficient to convince every unprejudiced Mind of the Error of believing in that Principle of the ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination of the Almigh|ty of any Part of Mankind to De&s;truction.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1726.</NOTE>THINE, dated <HI>November</HI> 30. 1725. I re|ceived a few Days ago, I having been vi&s;it|ing the People along the Sea-&s;hore in the <HI>Jer&s;eys</HI> (in the Love of Chri&s;t, hoping to bring &s;ome to him) among whom, in a general Way, the Go&s;pel which I had to preach in his Name, found Acceptance, for which I was truly thankful; and tho' I had no earthly Con&s;ideration for &s;o doing, yet I had that inward Satisfaction, that I thought I would not exchange or part with it for the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Canterbury</HI>'s Revenue: And at my Return I received thy friendly Letter, which I was glad of, and that

mine to thee found that Acceptance, &s;o as to an&s;wer my Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>And whereas thou &s;ay'&s;t thy Aim and Hope hath been to per&s;wade us who call our&s;elves Friends (we profe&s;&s;ing our&s;elves Friends to all People) that our &s;u|perior Stre&s;s &s;hould be upon the grand Point of <HI>Chri&s;t within</HI>; we having found, by Experience, living and ble&s;&s;ed Experience, the great Benefit and Comfort of his mo&s;t &s;weet and glorious Pre&s;ence, by the Manife&s;ta|tion of his Power, Spirit and Grace, in and to our Souls, we cannot do otherwi&s;e than lay the greate&s;t Stre&s;s thereon, our Benefit therein, and thereby, be|ing not ea&s;ily expre&s;&s;ed, &s;o as to be under&s;tood by the carnal Mind, or to tho&s;e who are in a State of Dege|neration; <HI>Chri&s;t within</HI> was, is, and ever will be, the Hope of the &s;anctified Soul's Glory, though a My&s;te|ry hid from Ages of unregenerate People, or from tho&s;e who are in the Reprobation; <HI>Know ye not your own&s;elves, that Chri&s;t is in you, except ye be Repro|bates,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 5. <HI>Col.</HI> i. 2.</P>
<P>From the above I would not be under&s;tood, as though I believed that Chri&s;t is no where but in his People; neither did I ever under&s;tand any of our Friends &s;o, though we have been often mi&s;repre&s;ented on that Head.</P>
<P>And as to the Ceremony of the Hat, and the Plural Language to &s;ingle Per&s;ons, I thus an&s;wer, that many of us left that Way of Salutation and Speaking, thro' &s;trong Conviction, accompanied with the&s;e Rea&s;ons;</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> It being a Re&s;pect we pay Almighty God, <HI>He being our Head, is honoured by uncovering our Head</HI> (as &s;aid the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 4.) We think for that Rea&s;on it is not right to uncover our Heads to Men; but that to give one another our Hands, in an inward and hearty Re&s;pect, is better.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> We read in the Holy Scriptures, that <HI>Morde|cai</HI> could not bow to <HI>Haman</HI> for Con&s;cience Sake, <HI>E&s;ther</HI> iii. 4. and I think it may &s;afely be concluded,
<PB N="550" REF="006297_0561_10285C5F72ADEC38">
that he did not take off his Hat, or uncover his Head, though he was in Danger to have &s;uffered for it. And,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> The three Children of God walked in the Pre&s;ence of the great King of <HI>Babylon</HI> (and tho&s;e pre|&s;ent with him) with their Hats on; and they &s;tood the King's Fury, and the Fire, though &s;even Times hot|ter than u&s;ual, with their Hats on, as there related in <HI>Dan.</HI> iii. 21.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech thee, my good Friend, to con&s;ider the Tenor of the Holy Scriptures maturely, and then I hope thou will not think the Hat, and the Language of <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> to a &s;ingle Per&s;on, to be needle&s;s Ce|remonies and Incumbrances, according to our Princi|ple and Practice; I do not write thus to thee for Con|tention, nor in a contentious Spirit or Mind, but in the innocent Love of our dear Lord Je&s;us, and for E|dification, or, if Need be, for Information.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, as to <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> to a &s;ingle Per&s;on, I an&s;wer, That the Holy Scripture (or the Words of God therein recorded) is by all Prote&s;tant Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t, acknowledged a Rule to us all, next to the Holy Spirit, from whence they came, or the Holy Gho&s;t, that our Saviour promi&s;ed "&s;hould lead into all Truth, and abide with the true Believers for ever;" and that God and Chri&s;t's Spirit, doth not contradict the Holy Scriptures, which came and proceeded from thence: This general Propo&s;ition we all agree to, if we rightly under&s;tand one another.</P>
<P>Then, according to this Rule, our plain Language is right, otherwi&s;e I &s;hall be obliged to thee to &s;hew us wherein we err from that good Rule. Now, the Mo&s;t High thought good to teach and u&s;e that Lan|guage in the Beginning to our fir&s;t Parents; &s;o that it is our Mother Tongue, and it is the Language of the Bible, or Holy Scriptures, from <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the <HI>Reve|lations.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e I need not tell thee, that <HI>You</HI> to a &s;ingle Per&s;on had its Ri&s;e from Pride and Flattery; and
<PB N="551" REF="006297_0562_10285C6262B40498">
thy&s;elf knoweth, that <HI>You</HI> to a &s;ingle Per&s;on, is nei|ther good <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> nor good Grammar.</P>
<P>And if I am rightly informed, your Forefathers, as well as ours, made u&s;e of this plain Scripture Language of <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> to a &s;ingle Per&s;on, in their fir&s;t Separation from the common Sinners of their Times.</P>
<P>Though I thus apologize for the plain Scripture Language, yet in Re&s;pect of Faith or Grace, and Prin|ciples to be believed, which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, I call the&s;e but &s;mall Things; but we are not to de&s;pi&s;e the Day of &s;mall Things, if we are faith|ful in the little, or le&s;s, we have the Promi&s;e of more or greater Things, <HI>Luke</HI> xix. 17.</P>
<P>I pray thee excu&s;e this long Letter of Epi&s;tle; for it &s;eems to me but meet that we &s;hould render a Rea|&s;on for our Di&s;u&s;e of tho&s;e Things u&s;ed by &s;ome (of mo&s;t Societies) profe&s;&s;ing the Chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P>And in Re&s;pect of Water-Bapti&s;m, and the Bread and Wine: 1&s;t, As to Water-bapti&s;m, I have this to an&s;wer, the which I hope thou wilt charitably con|&s;true.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Account that we have of it, is from <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> who fir&s;t practi&s;ed it, according to the Ac|count the Evangeli&s;ts give concerning it, and he &s;aid, <HI>I indeed baptize with Water, but he</HI> (Chri&s;t) <HI>&s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire</HI>; plainly di&s;tin|gui&s;hing between the two Bapti&s;ms, and the two Na|tures of them; adding, <HI>I &s;hall decrea&s;e, but he &s;hall in|crea&s;e</HI>: He &s;poke not of their Per&s;ons; but of their Di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P><HI>William Dell,</HI> a bright and learned Man in his Day (and, as I take it, when he flouri&s;hed mo&s;t in Divine Religion) wrote an excellent Piece on the Subject of Bapti&s;m, which be plea&s;ed to peru&s;e; it is very evan|gelical, and well worth reading; I &s;hall take Care to procure thee one of his Books; I am the more con|cerned about this Subject, becau&s;e thou art po&s;itive a|bout our coming to it, if we improve in Wi&s;dom:
<PB N="552" REF="006297_0563_10285C663235CA50">
But I would hope to be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure in&s;trumen|tal to convince thee that there is no ab&s;olute Need (in order to Salvation) to go into or unto the Water or Element; but that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us to go unto and into Chri&s;t, that being the Way to be new Creatures, as it is written, <HI>He that is in Chri&s;t, is a new Creature,</HI> 2 Cor. v. 17.</P>
<P>Our dear Lord on this Subject &s;ays, <HI>John truly bap|tized with Water, but ye &s;hall be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t:</HI> Here our Saviour, as well as <HI>John,</HI> di|&s;tingui&s;heth between the two Di&s;pen&s;ations: <HI>John</HI>'s was indeed a glorious Di&s;pen&s;ation in its Time; but Chri&s;t's far exceedeth it in Glory, and is to endure for ever.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> remembred this Doctrine of Chri&s;t, when the Holy Spirit's Bapti&s;m was come, <HI>Then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I remembred the Word of the Lord, John baptized with Water, but ye &s;hall be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Acts xi. 16. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>He was not &s;ent to bap|tize, but to preach the Go&s;pel</HI>; which, when truly preached, hath a &s;piritual baptizing Power attending it; and if we come rightly to be baptized with the Holy Spirit, and Fire of the Divine Word, we &s;hall witne&s;s a Renovation, and the Work of Reformation and Regeneration will go forward more and more, both without and within, in Body and in Spirit, for which every true Chri&s;tian and Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t longs and prays with fervent De&s;ires; the Apo&s;tle &s;ays (and pray be plea&s;ed to judge for what Rea&s;on) <HI>That the Kingdom of Heaven is not Meat or Drink, but Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 14.17.</NOTE> <HI>Peace, and Joy, in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Oh! may the Mo&s;t High in&s;pire thy Soul when thou reads the&s;e Lines is my tender De&s;ire.</P>
<P>I know I am writing to one who in many Things is far before me; &s;o that I write in a Fear, mixed with Chri&s;tian Love; and if it meet with the &s;ame Love in thee, that will cover a Multitude of Faults.</P>
<P><PB N="553" REF="006297_0564_10285C67B6BDAFE8">And as to the Supper or Ceremony of Bread and Wine (which is called a Sacrament, which Word we find not in the Bible) we do not under&s;tand that our Lord laid it as an Injunction on his Followers to ob|&s;erve or practice to Perpetuity; or that the Ob&s;ervati|on thereof is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, and that his Church &s;hould be in the Practice of the Ele|ments of either Water to dip in, or &s;prinkle with, or Bread and Wine to eat or drink, as a la&s;ting Ordi|nance, to be ob&s;erved by his Believers in an outward Way for ever.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in Remem|brance of me</HI>; which to me &s;eems to leave it indifferent|ly: Al&s;o from the Debates and Contentions of Chri|&s;tians about it, and the Blood that hath been &s;pilt and &s;hed in this Controver&s;y, and the many Doubts ari&s;ing concerning it, I think it is evident, that Chri&s;t was not po&s;itive that his Followers &s;hould be found to Perpe|tuity therein; and where he &s;ays, <HI>Take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you,</HI> or for many; <HI>and drink, this is my Blood which is &s;hed for many</HI>; I be|lieve it is not to be doubted but that he pointed at his Fle&s;h and Blood, rather than the Bread and Wine (as in a Figure) and that al&s;o he had an Eye to his &s;piritu|al Fle&s;h and Blood or Body, as where he &s;ays, <HI>Except ye eat my Fle&s;h, and drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you</HI>; the which every true Chri&s;tian &s;hould daily feed upon, and without which we have no Divine Life in us; and as him&s;elf al&s;o &s;aid, <HI>My Fle&s;h is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed.</HI></P>
<P>And it is worthy of note, that much of his Holy Words, and heavenly Doctrine, was &s;piritually to be under&s;tood; <HI>My Words</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are Spirit and Life</HI>; a glorious Speech to &s;uch as truly witne&s;s and under&s;tand it, which is much better felt by a true believing Chri|&s;tian than expre&s;&s;ed: Ohmay we &s;o open our Hearts to our beloved Je&s;us, that he may come in unto us, and that we may &s;up with him, and he with us, and that

<HEAD><HI>YOUTH</HI> per&s;waded to Obedience, Gratitude, and Honour, to GOD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONE of the fir&s;t Things pious and good Chri&s;tians generally endeavour to in&s;til into their Children, in their Youth, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1730.</NOTE> the true Knowledge of God; and that he made them, and for what End.</P>
<P>The Almighty made us all on Purpo&s;e for his Glo|ry, and that we &s;hould &s;erve and wor&s;hip Him, as &s;aid the Four and Twenty Elders who &s;tand before the Throne of God, and wor&s;hip Him continually, &s;aying, <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power: For thou ha&s;t created all Things, and for thy Plea&s;ure they are, and were crea|ted,</HI> Rev. iv. 8,&mdash;11.</P>
<P>Man being a noble (if not the noble&s;t) Piece of this vi&s;ible Creation, was doubtle&s;s made and created for a Purpo&s;e of his Glory.</P>
<P>But Sin is of the Devil, and did, and (if not re|pented of) always will di&s;honour God, and bring Ru|in upon both Body and Soul.</P>
<P>Therefore, O Youth! be prevail'd upon before it be too late, rightly to <HI>remember thy Creator in thy Youthful Days, before the evil Day come.</HI> And certain|ly it will be an evil Day to thy Soul, when God by his Spirit leaves &s;triving with thee, and leaves thee to thy|&s;elf: For he hath &s;aid, His <HI>Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with Man, for that he al&s;o is Fle&s;h,</HI> Gen. vi. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="558" REF="006297_0569_10285C758D26B6E8">While therefore God by his Spirit is &s;triving with thee, and calling thee by his Grace to Repentance, and to turn from the Evil of thy Ways, &s;aying, <HI>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die? Turn at my Reproof, and I will pour out of my Spirit upon you, and make my&s;elf known unto you.</HI> Again, <HI>I &s;tand at the Door and knock</HI> (here's a holy Stroke at the Heart) <HI>if any Man will hear my Voice</HI> (&s;ee the univer&s;al and unlimited Love of God in Chri&s;t to poor Mortals) <HI>and open the Door, I will come in to him,</HI> Rev. iii. 20.</P>
<P>If Man will open the Door of his Heart to his Maker and Saviour, he will come unto, or into his Soul. O Soul! no Gue&s;t in the World like this heavenly Gue&s;t; no Companion, no Friend in the World, like this great, this choice Friend, Almighty God. Oh! <HI>&s;eek him while he is yet to be found, and call upon him while he is near. Let the wicked for&s;ake his Way, and the unrighte|ous Man his Thoughts</HI> (that are evil) <HI>and return to the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him</HI> (and as &s;ay the Righteous, who &s;eek the Glory of God, and the Good of Souls) <HI>and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</HI> I&s;a. lv. 7.</P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>Turn, turn, O turn! why will ye die,</HI> ye curi|ous Workman&s;hip of God's holy Hands, ye fine and beautiful young Men and Women?</P>
<P>The Youth &s;hould al&s;o gratefully and obediently re|member their careful Fathers, and indulgent and ten|der Mothers: Unto &s;uch Youths God has promi&s;ed a Re|ward, the which Promi&s;e I have &s;een fulfill'd in many Thou&s;ands; and God is more and more fulfilling of it every Day; and will fulfil it to the End of Time.</P>
<P>And how rea&s;onable is it that we &s;hould remember with Tenderne&s;s, our Father who begat us, and not to di&s;obey him in his lawful and ju&s;t Commands, nor wit|tingly or willingly vex or grieve him?</P>
<P>Pray how &s;hall we be ever able to pay or retaliate him for all his Care, and the Co&s;t and Charge he hath been at in bringing of us up, till we come to be young
<PB N="559" REF="006297_0570_10285C77422A3300">
Men and Women? Can we ever do enough for him that hath done &s;o much for us?</P>
<P>Oh! how unhand&s;ome it is, as well as irreligious and unchri&s;tian, for a young Man or Woman, when their Parents are old, and perhaps full of Aches and Pains, or otherwi&s;e in Years and in bad Health, to treat them with Scorn and Contempt, or be &s;urly and chur|li&s;h, and flout at and di&s;obey their whole&s;ome Coun&s;el and Advice.</P>
<P>On &s;uch young People I have &s;een the heavy Hand of God in my Day, and made Ob&s;ervations thereof, many and many a Time. O! the many di&s;obedient Youth that I have &s;een, that have been Examples and Warnings to others, of the ju&s;t Judgment of God Almighty, upon di&s;obedient and prophane young Peo|ple; and indeed too many old Ones too.</P>
<P>But the Youth are too apt to think and &s;ay, Our Bones are full of Marrow, and our Veins of Blood, and our Blood is warm; we cannot be &s;o dull and heavy as old Men.</P>
<P>Well, who hath fill'd, and by who&s;e Providence are your Bones and Veins full of Marrow and Blood? Is it not God? Is it not in Him you <HI>live, move, and have your being?</HI> What hath the Devil and Sin to do with all this? Should not God have the Marrow of your Days? And &s;hould not Youth &s;erve Him with their pure&s;t or fine&s;t Blood? And &s;hould they not be warm, and not lukewarm or cold, in and towards the Things of God and Heaven?</P>
<P>Thus to be vigorous and manly in the Work of God, is truly and rightly to honour our Parents, as God commands.</P>
<P>It is not to honour them with the Mouth and Lips only, but with the Heart, and with &s;erving God; for that is the Honour &s;poken of in the Holy Scripture.</P>
<P>None can rightly honour their Parents, who di&s;ho|nour God. If a young Man or Woman is reli|gious, and of a di&s;creet Conduct, and of a &s;ober and
<PB N="560" REF="006297_0571_10285C7A4A9B7C10">
ju&s;t Conver&s;ation: That indeed is a real Honour to, and honouring of our Parents. For, &s;ay People, when they behold ju&s;t and religious Youths, when their Father is living, <HI>Oh! how happy is that Man in his Children!</HI> And indeed it is an honourable Happi|ne&s;s: When, on the other Hand (Pity! Oh! Pity! Pity!) how many fine Youths, to look at (at a Di|&s;tance, to outward Appearance) have, through their Di&s;obedience, and vile Practice, brought down the grey Hairs of their careful and tender Parents, with Sorrow to the Grave.</P>
<P>And, as if their own Ruin and their Parents was not enough, bring, through their Intemperance and Folly, Ruin and De&s;truction on their Po&s;terity al&s;o; and what their Parents have with great Labour gain'd to bring them up, and educate them till they come to Maturity, they in a little Time &s;pend extravagantly and intemperately, as well as fooli&s;hly and incon&s;ide|rately; and &s;o bring Ruin and De&s;truction &s;wiftly on them&s;elves and Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>And another Subject but &s;eldom &s;poken of, or han|dled, is the extraordinary Regard we &s;hould have to oblige our Mothers, and the tender Care we &s;hould take to nouri&s;h and comfort them in Age; and not vex or grieve them, if po&s;&s;ible we could help it, for many Rea&s;ons, be&s;ides our religious Duty, as above, in Relation of Honour to Parents. And let me remind the Youths of this Age, of either Sex, that in the Time of the Law (the Law of God under the <HI>Mo&s;ai|cal</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation) the di&s;obedient Youths were to be brought out of the Camp or City, and all the People were to &s;tone them to Death.</P>
<P>'Tis true, our Go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, or the Di&s;pen&s;a|tion of our &s;weet Je&s;us, is not &s;o rigorous; but much more mild and gentle, as to the Body; yet, as to the Soul, without Repentance, the Di&s;obedient to natural Parents in general (be&s;ides to our Father in Heaven in particular) entail, upon them an eternal Cur&s;e in the
<PB N="561" REF="006297_0572_10285C7F4ABF53D8">
World to come, and many Cro&s;&s;es and Difficulties in this World. And herein the Go&s;pel exceeds the Law, it gives Time for Repentance, mixes Mercy with Judgment, and &s;anctifies our Troubles, Cro&s;&s;es and Afflictions, to us, through Repentance and Amend|ment of Life; whereas the Law in old Time was exe|cuted without Mercy or Pity, and with fierce Wrath, Vigour and Anger.</P>
<P>But to return to the tender Mother. Oh! the ten|der Soul of the tender Mother, how it yearns over the di&s;obedient Son or Daughter! And who that hath not a Heart of Flint or Adamant, but would comply or yield to the whole&s;ome Advice and Coun&s;el of &s;o ten|der a Parent, who brought us into the World? Af|fection to &s;uch a near Parent, one would think &s;hould con&s;train us to it.</P>
<P>However, if Religion or Affection is not &s;o predo|minant, let Rea&s;on do it. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> 'Tis a rational Con|&s;ideration that thy Mother &s;uffered many Pains, and much Sickne&s;s, which thou wert the Occa&s;ion of, even before thou wert brought forth into the World, be&s;ides the dolorous, bitter Pangs and Pains of Child-birth, which have co&s;t the Life of many a tender Mother.</P>
<P>And con&s;ider the fir&s;t Month after thou wert born, O the Care and tender Concern, the Watching, La|bour and Charge, cannot ea&s;ily be expre&s;s'd! What running to the Phy&s;ician upon every Symptom or Su|&s;picion of being ill, or out of Order? And mu&s;t all this be forgotten? O Height of Ingratitude! which too many poor young People are guilty of.</P>
<P>Though ble&s;&s;ed be the Almighty Lord, there are &s;ome who are truly and humbly thankful to God and their Parents for their Being, and their Well-being, be|lieving they can never fully requite Him or their Pa|rents.</P>
<P>Now, after our fir&s;t Month, what a deal of Fa|tigue and Trouble we give our Mothers, who &s;till, if they give us Suck (as many Mothers do; even
<PB N="562" REF="006297_0573_10285C81F52AB7C0">
Queens and Prince&s;&s;es, and many noble Women, not di&s;daining to give their Children Suck from their own Brea&s;ts, which certainly is the mo&s;t natural Way of bringing up and nouri&s;hing them; though, on &s;ome Con&s;iderations, a Nur&s;e may be di&s;pens'd with) how do we partake of their own Blood, to the wa&s;ting of their Spirits, and oftentimes their Fle&s;h al&s;o?</P>
<P>Surely nothing but Love and Duty could engage a Mother to the great Care and Fatigue which &s;he is o|blig'd to in Nur&s;ing and Suckling her Children, e&s;pe|cially if before-hand in the World? Who can expre&s;s the Toil and Care to keep the poor unthinking little Ones quiet, and the many weary Steps and Contrivan|ces to keep them from Crying? Although, by the Way, when they grow up, their Mothers may cry Night and Day too, and they take but too little No|tice of it <HI>(i. e.)</HI> the rebellious, ingrateful, and di&s;o|bedient Youth.</P>
<P>O Youth! mu&s;t all this be forgotten? Mu&s;t all this have no Con&s;ideration with you, and bear no due Weight upon your Minds! Oh! &s;urely no: God for|bid!</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Year being gone (which is oftentimes but the Beginning of Sorrow to the Parents) then they can|not ea&s;ily be tru&s;ted alone, or out of Sight, except in &s;ome good Hand; and if 'tis never &s;o little mi&s;&s;ing, then cries the Mother, <HI>Oh! where's the Child? What have you done with my Child? Who has got it?</HI> And never re&s;ts till &s;he's &s;atisfy'd about it; and when 'tis brought to her, O how &s;he embraces and ki&s;&s;es it, as if &s;he would wrap its Soul up in her own! and then the Heart, the Bo&s;om, and the Brea&s;t, are all open to it. What endearing Expre&s;&s;ions are pour'd out to it from its tender Mother! as, <HI>My Dear, my Love, my Jewel,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;ometimes from &s;ome Sort of Per&s;ons &s;uch fond Expre&s;&s;ions as are not ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>But, O melancholy Con&s;ideration! all this Love and Tenderne&s;s is too often rewarded with Hard-heartedne&s;s
<PB N="563" REF="006297_0574_10285C8397FDEFF0">

<P>This Con&s;ideration is remarkable, as we are al&s;o the Workman&s;hip of God, and human Creatures, That of all the Creatures God hath made, there's &s;carcely any &s;o helple&s;s &s;o long as Man; &s;o that Man is &s;o much the more obliged to his Parents, and parti|cularly his Mother, who feeds us when we can't feed our&s;elves, and carries us long before we can go alone, and defends us from Harm, or we mu&s;t peri&s;h. After all this, to be unkind and di&s;obedient to our Parents, is great Ingratitude; and I &s;carce ever &s;aw it go unpu|ni&s;h'd, even in this World: And pray let the Youth con&s;ider how it is like to fare with them in the next; for I addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who believe the &s;acred Writings of the Holy Scriptures; for to others, &s;ome Things herein may &s;eem fabulous, as <HI>Judgment to come</HI> doth to the <HI>Athei&s;t,</HI> tho' divers of them feel it begin to come before they go out of the World, as hath been the Ca&s;e of many which might be mentioned.</P>
<P>From the Brea&s;t, and the Arms, to the &s;eventh Year of our Age, who can relate the World of Trou|ble our parents have with us to keep us out of Harm's Way, to keep us from bad Company, to keep us in Health as much as lays in their Power, to clothe us, and keep us whole and clean, and take Care that we learn no ill Words or Manners; for about this Time, little Youths are very apt to learn Good or Evil; and the careful, virtuous Parents, would do well to endea|vour to cultivate their tender Minds, and to plant Things good and profitable in them betimes. It often turns to good Account (though not always) and when it doth not, the Parents, having done their Duty are clear of their Blood, and of what Mi&s;chief may befal them through their Ungodline&s;s, and Folly, and Intem|perance, afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="564" REF="006297_0575_10285C8656134A78">From the Seventh to the Fourteenth Year, then the Care of wi&s;e and thoughtful Parents is to give them &s;uit|able Learning, and to &s;eek for the be&s;t Ma&s;ter that can be got for them, which indeed is a great Point of Prudence; for corrupt and intemperate Teachers are often hurtful to Youth, and Men of bad Principles may be In&s;truments of in&s;tilling the like Principles into the Children. A good Under&s;tanding, good Manners, and good Principles, a religious, wi&s;e and di&s;cerning, Parent, would e&s;teem before Letters and Figures; al|though to be well in&s;tructed in the&s;e al&s;o, is con&s;idera|ble, but the other preferable. And here let Teachers and the Youths be careful of Idlene&s;s, for that is the Mother of many Mi&s;chiefs; and bad Words, bad Ac|tions, and bad Company, ought to be avoided, which taint and corrupt the Minds of the little tender Youths.</P>
<P>'Tis melancholly to think of it, that &s;ome Youths, who never heard bad Words in their Father's Hou&s;e, &s;uch as taking the Sacred Name in vain, Cur&s;ing, Swearing, Talking rudely, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould come from School full with it, &s;o that the good Intention of the Parents in giving their Youth Schooling, is then cir|cumvented in a great Degree; to regulate which, the Parents and Tutors &s;hould join together in a whole|&s;ome Di&s;cipline. Some indulgent Parents mightily hurt their Youth by tying up the Hands of their Teach|ers from di&s;creet Correction. No di&s;creet Teacher will u&s;e Broom or Mop-&s;tick, or Door and Window-bars, to correct their Youths; that would be unmanly, as well as unwi&s;e; but the Rod never did hurt, in a &s;kilful Hand. And both at Home and at School, 'tis profitable for the Youth to be diligent in Reading the Holy Scriptures, which are preferable to all other Books, though other good Books are profitable al&s;o, and beneficial to improve the Under&s;tanding; where|as filthy and irreligious corrupt Romances, and pro|phane Play-Books often poi&s;on, and are the Bane or Ru|in

in of Youth; and when once they come to be in Love with tho&s;e black dark Works, &s;acred Truths are of little Value with them, which is an evident Token or Sign of the evil Tendency of evil Books: Though there may be &s;ome Sort of Philo&s;ophy in &s;ome of them, yet, it 'tis vain, and Lies, and Deceit, we had Need to be careful our Youth are not &s;poil'd therewith; and indeed tho&s;e of riper Years are often hurt there|by, el&s;e why did the learned Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> write to the primitive Chri&s;tians, to <HI>beware le&s;t any of them &s;hould be &s;poil'd through</HI> [wrong] <HI>Philo&s;ophy, and vain Deceit,</HI> Col. ii. 8. If all this Care and Pains, be&s;ides Charge, &s;hould be forgotten, it betokens great Stupidity.</P>
<P>From Fourteen to Twenty-one, more Care comes on a-fre&s;h upon the Heart and Mind of the faithful and loving Father, and affectionate and tender Mother, that their Offspring may do well, both as to this World, and al&s;o to that which is to come. It is in|deed commendable, and al&s;o a Duty in the Parents, to take Care in putting their Children in a Way, as much as lies in their Power, to live in the World; but, above all Things, to endeavour to promote their eter|nal Happine&s;s and Intere&s;t in the Life to come. This is &s;o much the more honourable, by how much the one is external, and the other eternal. O Eternity! Eternity! that we did but think more upon it, tho' we thought le&s;s of the Externals; although &s;ome think too little upon the &s;ub&s;tantial Part of them too, and forget to be ju&s;t in the Things of <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> or between Man and Man.</P>
<P>But to return to the Youth; and as to Trade, the Law of Nations forbids them to trade, or to trade with them, till they arrive at the Years of Twenty One, as &s;uppo&s;ing their Under&s;tanding not fully ripe for Bu&s;i|ne&s;s till that Age; and therefore many, and &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t Heads on the Earth, and Men of va&s;t E&s;tates, have thought it rational and proper for Youth to be put Apprentice for &s;even Years: This is look'd up|on

as expedient, although they have many Thou&s;ands to give them when they come to Age: And indeed many Youths have been ruined and undone for Want of &s;uch Service; and &s;ome of the brighte&s;t and fine&s;t of our young Men have &s;pent more before they arriv|ed to that Age, than their Parents had to begin the World withal; nay, &s;ome, many times more, for want of Employ in &s;ome commendable Calling; for having &s;o much idle Time on their Hands, they have taken to idle Company, and become idle Companions them&s;elves al&s;o; and &s;o the Youth have corrupted one another, to their geat Hurt and Damage, as to their outward Sub&s;tance; and which is yet wor&s;e, as to their Soul's Welfare; and &s;uch <HI>evil Communication corrupts good Manners</HI>; and if they were employed in Bu&s;ine&s;s, they in this Re&s;pect would be out of Harm's Way, out of the Way of tho&s;e Rooks that would make a Prey of them.</P>
<P>In order to the Well-doing and Being of the Youth in the Time of his &s;even Years Servitude, we ought to be very careful to chu&s;e &s;uch Ma&s;ters as are of good Report: Fir&s;t, as to their Religion, Ingenuity, In|du&s;try, Ju&s;tice and Temperance, and one who hath acquir'd to a Way of living well: Such a Ma&s;ter is worthy, and ought to be obey'd. It often happens, that before this Time is over, the Youth are unea&s;y, and are wont to go home to their Parents, with Com|plaints; but without a real Occa&s;ion or Nece&s;&s;ity. It is far better, and much more honourable for young Men to &s;tay out their appointed Time: And then when they come to have their lawful Liberty, it will be more &s;weet to them; and People will be the more free and engaged to deal and trade with them, and the Parents will have the greater Encouragement to &s;et them up in their Calling. A common Maxim, which is generally fulfilled, is worthy of Note here <HI>(i. e.) Tho&s;e that are good for their Ma&s;ters, are good for them&s;elves,</HI> and it mo&s;tly happens &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="006297_0578_10285C8ECF76D4F0">And as to Ma&s;ters, &s;ince they are generally Gainers by the Service and Work of their Servants, they ought to u&s;e them well, as to their Accommodations, and not to exact their Labour to Oppre&s;&s;ion, <HI>remembering we have all a Ma&s;ter, which is in Heaven,</HI> and that e|very one of us (let our Condition be what it will in this World) mu&s;t be accountable for the Deeds done here on Earth, to him in his Kingdom.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not here be forgotten, that Servants ought not to &s;erve their Ma&s;ters with Eye-&s;ervice; but ju&s;tly do their Duty as though they were actually pre&s;ent, or really in View. And as their Indentures bind again&s;t Cards and Dice, and all unlawful Games, and Gaming being very de&s;tructive to Youth, as well as to their Ma&s;ters Intere&s;t, it is in an e&s;pecial Manner to be a|voided; for Gaming leads into many other Evils, and, at the be&s;t, tends to draw the Heart and Mind from heavenly to earthly Things. Al&s;o the Servant is not to &s;ee his Ma&s;ter any Ways defrauded, it being all one in the Foundation, whether the Servant doth it him|&s;elf, or &s;ees (with Approbation) another do it; and that which would make the Time the plea&s;anter, and &s;eem not &s;o long and tedious, is to be chearful and good natur'd, and to be &s;ure to frequent the publick Wor&s;hip of Almighty God; and Ma&s;ters would do well to let their Servants go &s;ometimes to more pri|vate Duty; and if the Servant be con&s;cientious, the Ma&s;ter will be no Lo&s;er by &s;uch Indulgence. Al&s;o Servants ought to be kind to their Ma&s;ters Children, which is reputable; and Ma&s;ters ought not to let their Children in&s;ult their Servants; and if the Servants me|rit Correction, let it be done prudently, and not in a Fury, or in the Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion; for &s;uch Correction, in the Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion, oftner hardens the Heart, than amends the Manners of the Youth &s;o corrected.</P>
<P>Both the Ma&s;ter and the Servant ought &s;trictly to ob&s;erve, and not to break their Covenants which they have mutually agreed to in their Indentures, &s;ign'd and &s;ealed before Witne&s;&s;es, or el&s;e they lo&s;e their Ti|tle

to Ju&s;tice, and as it is not prudent nor ju&s;t, neither is it lawful &s;o to do. It is a great Hapine&s;s in a Fa|mily when the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, Men-Servants and Maid-Servants, live together in Love and Good-will, and endeavour to promote each others Intere&s;t: Then when there is Occa&s;ion to part, the good Wi&s;hes of each other go along with the&s;e who go, and &s;tay with tho&s;e who &s;tay. And the Care of Parents in this Affair, is worthy the Youth's &s;olid Thought and Con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Thus after the fine and &s;prightly young Man hath faithfully &s;erved his Apprentice&s;hip, and is arrived to the Age of one and twenty Years, when it is lawful for him and others to deal and trade one with another, then it may be &s;uitable for him to marry according to the Ordinance of God, and his early In&s;titution in Pa|radi&s;e, who then &s;aid (and his Word is the &s;ame to this Day) <HI>It is not good for Man to be alone,</HI> whatever others may &s;ay to the contrary. Oh! what Pity and Shame it is, that &s;o many (otherwi&s;e) great Wits, and fine flouri&s;hing young Men, &s;hould plead and practi&s;e again&s;t lawful Marriage, to their la&s;ting Reproach and Infamy; and if they &s;hould have any Po&s;terity, it is a Scandal on them al&s;o, tho' they are innocent; for through their Parents Faults, they are pointed at as il|legitimate: And the inevitable Con&s;equences of &s;uch filthy Mixtures, are mon&s;trous Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But let us hope and endeavour better for our pre|&s;ent ri&s;ing Generation, and our hopeful and flouri&s;hing Youths: And &s;ince the State of Marriage is an ex|ceeding happy State of Life, if perform'd in the Fear and Love of God, and with Con&s;ent of Parents and Parties concern'd; and otherwi&s;e the Rever&s;e: There|fore con&s;idering the Ba&s;hfulne&s;s of &s;ome Youths (and &s;ometimes to a great Fault) it might be well for the Parents in Time to propo&s;e Marriage to their Children, who &s;ometimes have been lo&s;t for Want of per|forming it in the Fear and Love of God; and indeed it being one of the greate&s;t Concerns in Life, and being

for Life, a young Man and a young Woman ought therefore to act therein with the greate&s;t Care and Cau|tion, as ought the Parents al&s;o. And let the Parents be helpful to their Youth, according to their Ability, and according to the Indu&s;try of the Youth, and &s;till be helping them, which is an Encouragement to in|genious and virtuous young People. By being too &s;trait-handed, there may be a wi&s;hing for the Death of the Parents, &s;aying, <HI>They cannot carry it with them to their Graves</HI>; yet the Parent is not to impoveri&s;h him&s;elf for his Children; for that hath &s;ometimes ru|in'd both Parents and Children al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Parents may propo&s;e, but the Youth ought to chu&s;e, becau&s;e they mu&s;t live and die by it; the chief Motive of Marriage ought to be pure and true Love, which the Parents cannot give to the Children for each other; they may give them Money, and give them Advice, but they cannot give them Love; and Pa|rents, by over-awing and over-per&s;wading them, have brought Ruin on many a beautiful Son and Daughter.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e of Marriage, the Choice (if we de&s;ign to be happy for Term of Life) ought to be a virtuous Per&s;on: That ought to be our chiefe&s;t Aim. Our Happine&s;s doth not con&s;i&s;t in either Riches, or Beau|ty; for <HI>Riches make them&s;elves Wings, and fly away,</HI> Prov. xxiii. 5. And Beauty is a fading Flower: Vir|tue is much more preferable and enduring; to have all the&s;e together in one Per&s;on, is &s;uch a Rarity as is hard to be found. And in this great Ca&s;e of Marriage, it is an excellent Thing to be equally match'd, or in the Apo&s;tle's Words, <HI>equally yok'd:</HI> Not one of one Per&s;wa&s;ion in Religion, and the other of another; not one very old, and the other very young: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> For where Two of different Per&s;wa&s;ions marry, and have Children, which Way mu&s;t the Children &s;teer their Cour&s;e? After the Father, or the Mother? And if the Parents are both true to their contrary Principles, who mu&s;t prevail in relation to their Childrens Way

<P>Tho&s;e who marry on Account of Riches, are very often di&s;appointed; for they very &s;oon are on the Wing; they'll fly away, &s;ometimes in the Flames, and &s;ometimes they will &s;teal away in the dark by Theft; and &s;ometimes they will &s;wim away by Water, or fly away with Canvas Wings, and never return; and &s;ometimes by the Intemperance and Extravagancies of the Man or Woman, are mo&s;t profu&s;ely wa&s;ted. And here let it be noted, that to live comfortably in the World, there mu&s;t be both in the Man, and al&s;o in Woman, Indu&s;try and Frugality; for otherwi&s;e, if One hath a hundred Thou&s;and a Year, it might all, and more than all, be &s;pent in Exce&s;s; and if the Man be extravagant, the Woman and her Family mu&s;t &s;uf|fer; and likewi&s;e, if the Woman is extravagant, and lives to Exce&s;s, that Man cannot thrive in the World; &s;o that both mu&s;t manage their Affairs with Frugality and Indu&s;try; and then no Doubt, but through the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, they may be very happy in one ano|ther, and in their outward Affairs, and in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us the Lord: But then the Ble&s;&s;ing of God mu&s;t be &s;ought chiefly, and above all.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the very Old marrying with the very Young, is mo&s;tly attended with Inconveniency, as daily Expe|rience teaches; for too generally &s;uch Matches are on the one Side for Riches; for where do we find a young Man that marries a poor old Woman, or a young Wo|man that marries a poor old Man? And how often have we heard young Ones &s;ay, <HI>They would never mar|ry old Ones any more?</HI> And one may well &s;uppo&s;e, they had not married tho&s;e old Ones they did, if it had not been for their Riches; and many Times Pro|vidence has di&s;appointed them in the Enjoyment of what they &s;o much &s;ought for.</P>

<P>But as our Parents in Paradi&s;e, &s;o we in this Para|di&s;ical State, have the &s;ame &s;ubtle, &s;erpentine Spirit to war withal; for Satan envies us this Happine&s;s, and u&s;es all his Craft and Subtlety to break the Love and &s;trict Union between Man and Wife, and to turn it to Hatred and Bitterne&s;s; &s;o that in&s;tead of dying for one another, they wi&s;h one another dead; and &s;ome|times the innocent Sufferer dies indeed, with Sorrow and Grief; and the Survivor meets with one who pays off all former Scores.</P>

<P>As the De&s;ign of the Almighty in the Beginning was, in his Ordinance of Marriage, that the Man and
<PB N="575" REF="006297_0586_10282E5EFA888710">
the Woman &s;hould be Help-meets to each other in divers Relations: So it behoveth us to an&s;wer this great End and noble De&s;ign, in his Fear.</P>
<P>In our dome&s;tick Affairs, we &s;hould draw together, and help one another; the Woman in her Hou&s;hold Affairs at home, and the Man in his nece&s;&s;ary Affairs abroad, &s;eeking to God for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon their La|bours: And if Accidents happen, or Lo&s;&s;es or Cro&s;&s;es, by Fire or Water, by Sea or Land, the loving Hu&s;|band, and the tender Wife, will help to comfort the mo&s;t grieved with &s;oft and kind Expre&s;&s;ions; &s;uch as <HI>My Dear, &s;ince it is our Lot to meet &s;uch Di&s;appoint|ments, and great Lo&s;&s;es, &s;ince we could not help it; and we are not become poor through Idlene&s;s, or Extrava|gancy, let's endeavour to bear it as patiently as we can; and let us comfort and cheer up one another: We do not know but all this may be for the be&s;t; and if the Almigh|ty &s;ees meet, He can give us more than ever we yet had. If not, let us endeavour to be content, and try to make it up in loving one another.</HI></P>
<P>And as to Religion, a Man and Woman fearing God, may be very helpful to one another, they hav|ing many Opportunities, to &s;peak their Experiences to each other; and Times, wherein they may read the Holy Scriptures, and explain their Sen&s;e, of particular Pa&s;&s;ages and Places to one another and the Family, without Interruption or Fear of Offence, or offending contending Per&s;ons; and by &s;tirring up one another to true Religion, and the Fear and Wor&s;hip of the mo&s;t High God.</P>
<P>Thus living and continuing in the Love and holy Fear of God, and true Faith of Chri&s;t, they have good Ground to hope at la&s;t to die in his Favour. Oh who would but hope to live and die like &s;uch a Pair!</P>

<HEAD>Free Thoughts communicated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1735.</NOTE>HAVING had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with a young Man of bright natural Parts, concerning a|nother World, and of leaping out of this into that in the Dark, which mu&s;t needs be very dangerous; and fearing that many take that great Leap out of this World into the next in that Manner, I have been induced to write the&s;e Lines.</P>
<P>Upon which I cannot forbear immediately asking, What Man in his Sen&s;es will venture (naturally &s;peak|ing) to leap in the Dark, he knows not where? Or into a Pit, he knows not the Bottom of? To think of it is terrifying, and mu&s;t needs &s;hock any con&s;ide|rate Free-thinker.</P>
<P>Now, though a Man, having a bright Genius, and a large Share of natural Parts, may acquire much literal and natural Knowledge; yet, for Want of a &s;piritual Under&s;tanding, which is derived from the Di|vine Spirit, he may greatly err concerning true Faith and Religion, and have no Apprehen&s;ion of the eter|nal Kingdom and Judgment of God, or of another World; which it might be well for the ungodly were not, or were never to be at all: Which, were it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, yet to live virtuou&s;ly (as the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sarum</HI> ob&s;erv'd to that great Libertine the Earl of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter</HI>) would be an Advantage to Men, even in this World.</P>
<P>But if there &s;hould be an eternal, righteous King|dom (of which we may be internally and &s;piritually &s;en&s;ible) and a State of Life therein to come; then, O then, what will become of the Wicked, and all who forget God! and what Perturbation of Soul mu&s;t attend &s;uch, when, under the Convictions thereof, they
<PB N="579" REF="006297_0590_10285CB007CDDD20">
&s;hall be ready to launch into Eternity. I be&s;eech thee (O Soul) &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, before it be too late.</P>
<P>The great Saviour of the World &s;ays, <HI>The Kingdom of God is within you,</HI> Luke xvii. 21. That is, inward|ly and &s;piritually, to be known and perceived. He al|&s;o &s;ays, <HI>I am the Light of the World,</HI> John viii. 12. He, by his divine and &s;upernatural Light, lights us through this dark World to his &s;piritual and glorious Kingdom, where he rules and reigns in tran&s;cendent Maje&s;ty and Brightne&s;s; of which his faithtul Subjects are in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible: Glory to the King of Kings for ever.</P>
<P>And that eminently wi&s;e Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>He was &s;ent to turn Men from Darkne&s;s to Light.</HI> Darkne&s;s he calls the <HI>Power of Satan,</HI> and Light <HI>the Power of God.</HI> Now as a Man walking in outward Darkne&s;s is in continual Danger of falling, not knowing whither he goeth; &s;o al&s;o a Man living and walking in &s;piritu|al Darkne&s;s (which is the Power of <HI>Satan,</HI> where the wonderful Power and Works of God cannot be &s;een nor under&s;tood) mu&s;t needs be in the greate&s;t Danger of falling into the bottomle&s;s Pit of Perdition, where horrible Darkne&s;s and unutterable Mi&s;ery prevails for ever.</P>
<P>The many bitter Cries, dreadful Shrieks, and hea|vy Groans, which my Ears have heard from &s;uch dark Souls, ready to depart the Body, have been enough to convince me of the Judgment of another World, tho' there had been no other Demon&s;tration of it to me. May our fine Wits, and &s;prightly Youths concern'd, repent in Time. Oh, my Heart is pain'd for them; and my Soul mourns in &s;ecret for many of my former and latter Aquaintance, as I have al&s;o tender De&s;ires for the Well-doing and Well-being of Man|kind in General.</P>
<P>If any, by duly thinking of the&s;e Things, &s;hould be awaken'd and convinc'd of their State, and their former Lives and wicked Practices; and have &s;o much
<PB N="580" REF="006297_0591_10285CB1DAAEFA78">
Light as to &s;ee the Danger of living without God in the World; but be ready to conclude, that if there be indeed a righteous God, who will reward every Man according to his Works, there can then be no Hope for them, &s;uch wretched Sinners. Oh Souls (if this be the Ca&s;e of any) look not at &s;uch Thoughts, which (in the mid&s;t of your ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions) Satan taking Advantage, may thus &s;ugge&s;t to you; who having got you deep already in the Mire of Sin, wou'd by &s;uch Infu&s;ions plunge you deeper both into Sin and De|&s;pair.</P>
<P>Be it remembered that Chri&s;t died for Sinners, <HI>even the Chief</HI> (as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays) and he can make a chief Saint of a chief Sinner, as appears in the Ca&s;e of that A|po&s;tle by his own Te&s;timony: God hath, and can do it, though it be wonderful!</P>
<P>Wherefore abide not in Darkne&s;s, but repent, and turn to the Light of Life! &s;trive and &s;truggle for Life, the Life of God in the Soul of Man! turn ye to the Divine Light, turn to God, who is Light, and in him is no Darkne&s;s at all! live and walk in the Light of God, which is far above the Light of hu|man Rea&s;on; therein &s;hall we have Fellow&s;hip with the Father of Lights, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who&s;e Religion is Spiritual: <HI>God is a Spirit, and they that wor&s;hip him</HI> (aright) <HI>mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in Spirit and Truth.</HI></P>
<P>God mu&s;t be wor&s;hipped in Thought, Word, and Deed; that is, in all Things we ought to expre&s;s an humble Reverence and Adoration to the Sovereign Be|ing, frequently meditating on his great Name; but all Evil and &s;inful Thinking we mu&s;t refrain from with Abhorrence, as di&s;plea&s;ing to him; and is of the Devil that evil Spirit; and which indeed is contrary to the Nature and End of <HI>Free-Thinking</HI>; which is a &s;incere Exerci&s;e of the rational Faculty, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h between Good and Evil, Truth and Fal&s;hood, that we may chu&s;e and acknowledge the one, and avoid
<PB N="581" REF="006297_0592_10285CB48C1C99E8">
and reject the other. And here it may not be unfit to recommend the Care of all our Thoughts, from whence proceed our Words and Actions as naturally, as good and evil Fruit from the different Seed &s;own in the Earth.</P>
<P>And as the true&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ublime End of thinking (which is the rea&s;onable Service of every intelligent Creature) is the Contemplation, Fear, and Adoration, of the Almighty Creator; &s;o are we thereto great|ly encouraged by that Scripture of <HI>Mal.</HI> iii. 16, 17, 18. which I am concern'd here to tran&s;cribe and re|commend, and is as follows, <HI>Then they that feared the Lord, &s;pake often one to another, and the Lord heark|ned and heard it, and a Book of Remembrance was writ|ten before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name. And they &s;hall be mine, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, in that Day when I make up my Jewels, and I will &s;pare them as a Man &s;pareth his own Son that &s;erveth him. Then &s;hall ye return and di&s;cern between the Righteous and the Wicked, between him that &s;erveth God, and him that &s;erveth him not.</HI></P>
<P>In which Scripture we may ob&s;erve how great and glorious a Reward is promi&s;ed to tho&s;e that &s;anctify the Name of the Lord; the Con&s;ideration of which, mu&s;t needs rai&s;e their Love and Admiration, and add to their pre&s;ent Delight in &s;uch holy Thoughts.</P>
<P>But, on the contrary, it is to be feared, that evil Thinkers and Actors, when the Divine Spirit and Light wou'd in&s;pire them with good Thoughts, or convince them of their Sins, endeavour to &s;tifle or overcome &s;uch Thoughts or Motions as would awaken them to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or re&s;train them from Sin; and &s;trive, by their natural Wit, to rea&s;on the good Spirit out of their Souls; at the &s;ame Time opening their Hearts to the evil Spirit and his Sugge&s;tions, which they hug, to their own De&s;truction. But indeed to judge rightly of the&s;e Things, if a Man have ever &s;o much natural Wit, and &s;trength of Rea&s;on, it mu&s;t
<PB N="582" REF="006297_0593_102884D48CE9E0B0">
be &s;anctified through his faithful Subjection to the di|vine Will, and rais'd by divine In&s;piration; which as far &s;urpa&s;&s;es human Rea&s;on, as Heaven is above the Earth. May our Men of bright natural Thought think clearly and &s;eriou&s;ly of this. This is evident in the Ca&s;e of that great Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who was edu|cated at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> in the perfect Manner of the Law, yet, by all his Knowledge, could not ju&s;t|ly di&s;tingui&s;h concerning Religion, but was a Per&s;ecu|ter of the Church of Chri&s;t: But when his Know|ledge and Spirit came to be &s;anctified by the Grace and Spirit of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, then, and not till then, he became of great and good U&s;e and Service to his Maker and Mankind. Then his Rea&s;on and Religion became Spiritual,
<Q>who had not conferred with Fle&s;h and Blood, but had been obedient to the heavenly Vi&s;ion,</Q>
<HI>Gal.</HI> i. 16. And he &s;ays (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 19.) <HI>If in this Life only we have Hope in Chri&s;t, we are of all Men mo&s;t mi&s;erable.</HI> So that his Hope and Expec|tation (as of all faithful Believers) mu&s;t have been of a|nother Life, and the Kingdom of God hereafter; <HI>For here</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>we have no continuing City, but &s;eek one to come,</HI> Heb. xiii. 14. And though the Condition of &s;uch, in this Life, is often expo&s;ed to much Per&s;e|cution and Trouble for their Faith's Sake, towards the Name of God, and Te&s;timony again&s;t this World, and the evil Spirit ruling therein; yet, ble&s;&s;ed be the mo&s;t High, He gives them Strength, and the A&s;&s;u|rance of his Favour, whereby they endure to the End, as well as that he refre&s;hes them with his outward Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts: So that they may well &s;ay with his ancient Servant <HI>Job, Shall we receive Good at the Hand of the Lord, and not Evil?</HI> Job ii. 10. Thus Afflictions have been indeed u&s;ually call'd, but they often, in the Hand of God, are Means of redeeming the Soul, and rai&s;ing up many excellent Virtues, when they are rightly &s;ubmitted to.</P>
<P><PB N="583" REF="006297_0594_1028845EEBA7A0F0">But to return. I would enquire what Subject we can po&s;&s;ibly chu&s;e &s;o worthy of our Meditation, or from whence &s;o great Benefit can redound both to Spirit and Body? The Fear and Thoughts of Almighty God, which are in&s;pir'd by his Grace, &s;anctifying our Hearts, thereby render us more fit to receive his Favours both to Spirit and Body, which he multiplies according to his Wi&s;dom and good Plea&s;ure; and all our Faculties and Pa&s;&s;ions being redeem'd and govern'd by the Spi|rit of Faith, we &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy all Things in a more regular and excellent Manner. But who is there that hath not been &s;o great a Partaker of the ma|ny Ble&s;&s;ings, with which the infinite Creator filleth the World, and in an e&s;pecial Manner encompa&s;&s;eth Man|kind, as not to be thereby oblig'd to a continual Ac|knowledgment thereof, and Remembrance of the great and bountiful Author? The State therefore of the Wicked and Rebellious, is &s;tigmatiz'd in Holy Scrip|ture, with this Character in particular, that <HI>God is not in all their Thoughts,</HI> P&s;alm x. 4. And indeed for this came his Judgment upon the old World of the Un|godly, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed ever to have thought of the adorable Lord, &s;ince <HI>every Imagination and Thought of their Hearts were only Evil continually,</HI> as the Almighty him&s;elf hath complained. <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 5.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of the Returns of Faith and Love, how &s;ad a Con&s;ideration is it, that there &s;hould among Men be found any &s;o vile and fooli&s;h, as even to deny the divine Exi&s;tence, and the Effects of his infinite Power in the external Creation, and to affirm that all Things have come by Nature, without God, or any &s;upernatu|ral Power; which evil Tenet, &s;ome have endeavoured to ju&s;tify and &s;upport by natural Rea&s;on: (<Q>Where|in the Name thereof may indeed be abu&s;ed; but Rea&s;on it&s;elf, which concludes nothing without E|vidence, can never declare in Favour of a Propo&s;i|tion, for which, not only none can appear, but a|gain&s;t which the whole World is full of it. But
<PB N="584" REF="006297_0595_102884607147D070">
let this be di&s;po&s;ed for the Judgment of Rea&s;on. When therefore it is &s;aid. That all Things have come by Nature; if thereby we are to under&s;tand that natural Things are &s;everally Self productive, this will be di&s;po&s;ed by daily Experience; for we may ob&s;erve, that they depend one upon another, and upon various Cau&s;es for Production and Sub&s;i&s;tence, without which, neither, in a State of Nature, could po&s;&s;ibly be. But if it be meant of the univer&s;al Sy&s;tem of natural Things collectively, this will le&s;s be allowed of many, than of any Particular of them; becau&s;e that would de&s;troy the Nature of a Self-pro|ductive Power, which cannot be limited from be|ing infinite, and therefore can be but one: One In|finite Supreme Nature therefore only can have &s;elf-exi&s;ted, and mu&s;t have been the &s;upernatural Au|thor and Power, by whom all other Beings have exi&s;ted: Which refutes the above Error, and ra|tionally proves and e&s;tabli&s;hes the great Truth in the Que&s;tion.</Q></P>
<P>And this the Chri&s;tian Religion teaches in the great|e&s;t Perfection, that the Creator of all Things is God, an Infinite Eternal Spirit, who filleth all Things; who having been plea&s;ed to manife&s;t his eternal Power and Godhead in the vi&s;ible Frame of the Univer&s;e, bear|eth Witne&s;s of him&s;elf therein, by his Providence and Judgments; and in every Soul of Man by his inward In&s;pirations; e&s;pecially the &s;incere Believer, in whom his Spirit dwells and operates.</P>
<P>Oh! that Men therefore would lift up their Minds, and open their Hearts to him, when by his Holy Spi|rit He reproves them for Sin, and brings a Damp upon their Spirits for Evil; from which they would, per|haps if they could, run, or divert them&s;elves from the Sen&s;e of it: But alas! there is no fleeing from his Pre&s;ence, who is every where; nor avoiding his Judg|ment who&s;e Kingdom comprehends all Things: (but Woe e&s;pecially is to them with whom his Spirit cea&s;es
<PB N="585" REF="006297_0596_1028846249FA8508">
&s;triving!) Holy <HI>David</HI> certainly was very &s;en&s;ible of this, when he wrote that admirable De&s;cription of the Divine Onmipre&s;ence, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> cxxxix. 7th Ver&s;e to 12. <HI>Whither &s;hall I go from thy Spirit, or whither &s;hall I flee from thy Pre&s;ence? If I a&s;cend up into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermo&s;t Parts of the Sea, even there &s;hall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand &s;hall hold me. If I &s;ay, &s;urely the Darkne&s;s &s;hall cover me, even the Night &s;hall be Light about me, yea the Darkne&s;s hideth not from thee; but the Night &s;hineth as the Day: The Darkne&s;s and the Light are both alike to thee.</HI> With the&s;e Appre|hen&s;ions of the infinite Power, and Pre&s;ence of the Al|mighty, I &s;hall pa&s;s to the Relation promis'd in the Title Page, which may here be properly in&s;erted.</P>
<P>My Author was <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on,</HI> Merchant in <HI>Phi|ladelphia,</HI> who was pre&s;ent with the young Men, whom this extraordinary Providence befel, at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica</HI>; he gave me the following Account. Two in|genious young Men (who were lately arriv'd at <HI>Ja|maica</HI> from <HI>London</HI>) di&s;cour&s;ing about Earthquakes, a&s;&s;erted that all Things came by Nature; and &s;o argu|ed thereupon, that it brought Terror upon the Com|pany, who were many at Dinner in an upper Room: That whil&s;t this la&s;ted (to the A&s;toni&s;hment of all pre&s;ent) the Earth began to move and tremble, which put mo&s;t of them to Flight in &s;uch Ha&s;te, that they ran one almo&s;t over another, &s;ome down Stairs, others leaping over the Balcony. But my Author &s;aid, he con&s;ider'd that there was no running from Divine Pro|vidence, and that the &s;ame Hand which moved the Earth, was able to pre&s;erve him; in which he tru&s;ted, and was pre&s;erv'd: (And not only then, but at other Times, e&s;pecially among the <HI>Cannibals</HI> of <HI>Florida</HI>; as his Book of <HI>God's protecting Providence, &amp;c.</HI> &s;ignally evinceth.) Thus as he continued with the young Men in the &s;ame Room (Oh! terrible to relate, and my
<PB N="586" REF="006297_0597_10288464B52218B8">
Heart and Hand tremble in the Writing thereof) the mighty Hand of an offended God &s;truck the&s;e young Men with Death, and they fell down, and never ro&s;e more, being in all Appearance unprepar'd for &s;o &s;udden a Change. And how many other gay witty young Peo|ple have been &s;uddenly &s;natch'd away by Death, tho' perhaps not &s;o immediately, nor in &s;o extraordinary a Manner, &s;eems worthy of Reflection. The Author of this Account added, that he took up the young Men, and laid them one upon a Bed, and the other upon a Couch; but that they never &s;pake again after their Bla&s;phemy again&s;t God and his Works. Upon which I think it very natural, as well as nece&s;&s;ary, to remark, that this was indeed an eminent In&s;tance of the ju&s;t Judgment of God again&s;t &s;uch as deny his wonderful Power and Providence in the Creation; with this terrible Circum&s;tance, that the&s;e unhappy Per&s;ons were cut off in the mid&s;t of their ungodly Di&s;cour&s;e and corrupt Rea&s;oning, without &s;o much Time afforded them as to ask Pardon, and crave Mercy of a provok'd Lord; which is very dreadful to con&s;ider: And I e|&s;pecially recommend it to the &s;erious Reflections of all &s;uch as affect the Name of <HI>Free-Thinkers</HI> (as they are commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed) that they may no longer (under &s;uch a Pretence) abu&s;e their Under&s;tandings with a Latitude of profane and evil Thinking; who, as they mu&s;t needs be &s;en&s;ible, they have not conferr'd the excellent Faculty of Rea&s;on upon them&s;elves; &s;o they may as certainly conclude they never receiv'd it to ex|clude his Exi&s;tence, Power and Providence, out of the World, who gave it them; nor to employ it to their own De&s;truction, by &s;uch a Perver&s;ion thereof, which mu&s;t inevitably be the Con&s;equence, without timely and due Repentance; but that they may apply them&s;elves to him for true Wi&s;dom, who is the eternal Fountain of it, who would direct all their Thoughts aright there|in, then would they find a &s;ub&s;tantial and enduring Happine&s;s and Satisfaction, in the honourable Thoughts

<P>La&s;tly, if any Expre&s;&s;ion in this &s;hort Tract &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful to promote, in any Mea&s;ure, the Con|templation of the Divine Being; the Con&s;ideration of Man's Duty to him, his Almighty Creator, or to con|vince but one Soul of the Error of his Thoughts and Ways; the Author will think him&s;elf richly rewarded for his Endeavours, and reverently a&s;cribe the Glory and Prai&s;e to God, the prime Author and Mover of every good Thing, who is worthy for ever.</P>

<P>IF we duly con&s;ider the Nature of human Under|&s;tanding, as we &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily be led to admire the wonderful Author of &s;o excellent a Gift to Man|kind, according to the Power and Extent thereof; &s;o &s;hall we be forced to acknowledge its Imperfection, not only where the Natures of Things exceed its Views, but al&s;o in tracing and explicating that Evidence which many of them afford; but e&s;pecially as to its Influence in a moral Re&s;pect, how &s;ubject is it to be ob&s;cur'd, and its Faculties di&s;abled by the Violence of tho&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ions and Affections with which human Nature is too ordinarily agitated. So that Man cannot but want &s;ome extraordinary A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and he under the great|e&s;t Obligation to &s;ubmit every Faculty and Affection to the Direction and Di&s;po&s;al of that infinite Power and Wi&s;dom, which having &s;o wonderfully con&s;tituted, can be&s;t pre&s;erve, and conduct him to a State of Hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Can it then be thought unrighteous in the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all Things, &s;o to have fa&s;hion'd our Na|tures,

and ranged them (though above many other Beings, yet) in &s;uch a State of Dependance, as conti|nually to expre&s;s his Sovereign Power and Rectitude? Since by our entire Re&s;ignation to his Divine Hand, we may be transformed to a greater Likene&s;s of him, and have a Spirit and Nature &s;uperinduc'd of Divine Ex|traction from the Father of Lights; whom to know and contemplate, through the Revelation of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t (his infinite Love to Mankind) is eter|nal Life and &s;upreme Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Which My&s;tery, far above human Under&s;tanding, He hath been plea&s;ed to reveal by his Spirit, who &s;earcheth the deep Things of God, in order to work in us Faith in, and the highe&s;t Admiration of that exalted Name, by whom he hath vi&s;ited our low E&s;tate, and would re|deem it in him, into the greate&s;t Dignity it is capable of. The Particulars of who&s;e Incarnation, Pa&s;&s;ion, Re|&s;urrection, and A&s;cen&s;ion into eternal Glory, though highly admirable, and which the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, who had been an Eye-witne&s;s of his Glory, &s;ays, <HI>The An|gels de&s;ire to look into,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 12. can none of them however be perverted to a Sen&s;e of being repugnant to Rea&s;on; becau&s;e not impo&s;&s;ible to infinite Love, or in|finite Power; who could aba&s;e him&s;elf from his Glo|ry, and be made Fle&s;h in a Virgin; could work all Mi|racles, and the greate&s;t of all, the rai&s;ing him&s;elf from the Dead; and could a&s;cend up where he was before. All which are agreeable to right Rea&s;on, and appear &s;o with Ravi&s;hment to that enlightened and &s;anctified, e|&s;pecially with the Evidence of the Holy Spirit the Comforter, which confirmeth the humble Believer in the &s;aving Faith and Knowledge of the&s;e Things to the End. And I am glad of this Occa&s;ion to di&s;tin|gui&s;h to thee (<HI>ingenious Reader</HI>) that though no divine Truths are contrary to natural Rea&s;on; yet, as they far tran&s;cend it, they are not comprehen&s;ible by it, as other Truths within the Reach of its Capacity are: As no Nature below Man, nor qualified with Rea&s;on as

he is, can po&s;&s;ibly know as he knows. Which Ob&s;er|vation is not of the lea&s;t Importance to us: For if it therefore follows, <HI>that no Man knows the Things of God, but by the Spirit of God,</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 11. then can no Man without the Revelation of the &s;ame Spirit, know the My&s;tery of the Divine Power, by which he was created, and by which he mu&s;t be eternally &s;aved and ble&s;&s;ed. Grace therefore (or the Divine Spirit by its Influence and In&s;piration) mu&s;t be received and o|beyed as an infallible Oracle, if we would know and pur&s;ue tho&s;e Things which tend to our pre&s;ent and future Happine&s;s; as al&s;o the Authority of the Holy Scrip|tures &s;ubmitted to, as having proceeded from the &s;ame Grace, of which they faithfullly te&s;tify, and of that which is nece&s;&s;ary to be by us believed and practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Excellency and Nece&s;&s;ity of which divine Re|cord to Him&s;elf, Man certainly mu&s;t acknowledge, when he con&s;iders, that That alone has given him an Account of his own Origin (which, what Man could have known?) And that he &s;till may the better under|&s;tand him&s;elf, of his Lap&s;e and Corruption from that Excellency and Glory of his Nature (in which he was created) by departing from the Truth, into a Fable and Notion of Independency of Nature, and Sufficien|cy of Wi&s;dom without God. So that he is become as the Bea&s;ts which peri&s;h, as to the Nece&s;&s;ity of Di&s;|&s;olution to his mortal Part; and in his greate&s;t natural Honour, may, in that Re&s;pect, be compared to them; which is &s;ufficient to humble him under the Sen&s;e of his weak elementary State, with all the Glory and Ad|vantages that may attend it.</P>
<P>But if Man will not be convinced of the Imperfecti|on and Vanity of his Nature, by the Infirmities and Mi&s;eries to which it is continually &s;ubject; nor of the Glory of the Eternal Maje&s;ty, by the infinite Wonders thereof, throughout the Univer&s;e; rejecting the Te|&s;timony of his own Sen&s;es, of every created Thing,
<PB N="590" REF="006297_0601_1028846EAA4380F8">
and of the Scriptures of Truth; nor yet behold His Glory in the Appearance of the Saviour, which he reveals in every Con&s;cience; then mu&s;t his Blindne&s;s be concluded incurable, and his De&s;truction unavoid|able.</P>
