<P>THE good Reception the poetical manu&s;cript Writings of my decea&s;ed Father <HI>Aquila Ro&s;e,</HI> have met with in this Province, from Men of Wit and Ta&s;te, with a De&s;ire of &s;ome of tho&s;e to &s;ee them printed, induced me to collect what I could: But, many of his be&s;t Pieces were lent out, after his Decea&s;e, by my Mother, to Per&s;ons who have forgot to return them: And, perhaps the publi&s;hing the&s;e few, will put them in Mind of &s;ending them to me.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be wanting in Gratitude, if I did not return my humble Thanks to tho&s;e careful People who have favour'd me with the Pieces I now publi&s;h to the World; and to the Gentlemen, my Father's Friends, for their nice Encomiums to his Memory.</P>
