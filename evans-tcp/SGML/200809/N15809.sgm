<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t appear at fir&s;t glance to be of infinite importance to the authors and abettors of the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, that they con&s;ider well the ground on which they &s;tand. The error, (if it be one) cannot be &s;mall, or of little con&s;e|quence. It &s;trikes at the character and government of Jehovah the Eternal King. If they &s;hould be found talking wickedly for God, and pleading de|ceitfully for him, the ca&s;e is dreadful! The con|&s;equences of the doctrine to their own &s;ouls cannot be unintere&s;ting, and if they be contributing their exertions to harden the hearts of the impenitent, to &s;ooth and flatter them in &s;in, and &s;ing them into a deeper &s;leep on the falling brink of eternal ruin; how tremenduous is the idea! The apo&s;tle &s;ays, knowing the terror of the Lord we per|&s;wade men; our God is a con&s;uming fire; it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Hope and fear &s;eem to be the two powerful &s;prings of action in the human mind. The go&s;pel is a &s;o|lemn &s;erious addre&s;s to both; there the lightnings of God's wrath fla&s;h; his thunders roar; his ma|je&s;ty, purity, truth and ju&s;tice appear in terrible ar|ray; there al&s;o his love and goodne&s;s a&s;&s;ume the mo&s;t winning a&s;pect; his grace and mercy &s;hine with the mo&s;t amiable radiance. But there is no truth in all the book of God more clear, than that an acceptance of the Saviour and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="4" REF="020203_0003_0FAE3C6EF3F17858">
to him, are indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;alva|tion by him; and that this acceptance and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion mu&s;t take place in this life, in order to gain that end, one would think, is pretty clearly taught al&s;o. The doctrine of a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel in hell, or of tenders of grace and mercy there, to &s;ay the lea&s;t of it, does not &s;ound well. The author of this is a lover of mankind, and of divine truth; he wi&s;hes to follow truth wherever it leads. If the new doctrine be truth, he wi&s;hes to &s;ee it. From love to mankind, and he hopes, a &s;incere regard to their &s;alvation, he has given his &s;entiments on it, which he &s;ubmits to the candour of the public.</P>

<HEAD>BRIEF ANIMADVERSIONS ON THE DOCTRINE OF UNIVERSAL SALVATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to a clear perception of the ab&s;urdity of that doc|trine which I am about to con&s;ider, it may be proper to premi&s;e &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the nature of God's moral go|vernment; as inattention to this, &s;eems to lie at the founda|tion of the new &s;cheme. The idea of puni&s;hing men for their &s;ins appears hideous, and the idea of eternal puni&s;hment much more &s;o. The doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation is extremely po|pular, and bears the &s;emblance of great benevolence in its au|thors. But were it even true, &s;ome have que&s;tioned whe|ther it would &s;hew benevolence to propagate it, as it can pro|duce no good effects on &s;ociety. But if fal&s;e, as mo&s;t certainly it is, it is the mo&s;t &s;hocking cruelty to deceive men with a lie.</P>
<P>It will be readily granted by all men, that God has an un|doubted right to give laws to his creatures. He has a proper|ty in them which is altogether &s;ingular. He is the univer&s;al parent, the creator and pre&s;erver of all creatures. Has a father a right to govern his family? a governor to execute the laws of his government? much more has the father of all, the &s;u|preme governor of the univer&s;e, a right to give laws to the workman&s;hip of his own hands and &s;ee them execut|ed. It mu&s;t al&s;o be granted, that the goodne&s;s of God is clearly manife&s;ted in giving laws to his creatures, for the re|gulation of their conduct. This is a remark to which we &s;hould carefully attend. We are apt to &s;uppo&s;e, that the di|vine goodne&s;s is di&s;played only in giving us the&s;e things which we call benefits or mercies; and that his laws are arbitrary, unnece&s;&s;ary and unrea&s;onable re&s;traints. But this is far from being the ca&s;e; for the divine laws are all calculated not only to promote the glory of the lawgiver, but al&s;o the good of the creation. This remark is univer&s;ally true. It is by the laws of the &s;y&s;tem that the &s;y&s;tem is uphold. Were the law of attrac|tion or gravity to cea&s;e, this globe would fall to pieces, perhaps to annihilation. Were the &s;un to depart from the center and flame lawle&s;s through the mighty void. Were the planets to fly off from their orbits and ru&s;h wildly through the va&s;t ex|pen&s;e: or were the &s;ea to ri&s;e from its bed and da&s;h it&s;elf over
<PB N="6" REF="020203_0005_0FAE3C70777C44F8">
its boundaries on the face of the earth: or were the brutal tribes to lo&s;e their reverence for man and ri&s;e in one general con&s;piracy again&s;t his life: on all, on any of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, the life of man would be totally extingui&s;hed: on &s;ome of them matter would be wreck'd on matter, and worlds cru&s;h'd on worlds. But what are the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions? they are no more than to &s;uppo&s;e that God &s;hould revoke, or that the&s;e creatures &s;hould tran&s;gre&s;s were it po&s;&s;ible the laws which God hath given them. But &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch terrible con&s;e|quences to follow on inanimate or irrational creatures tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing the laws of their nature; and no ill con&s;equences to follow on rational and &s;piritual beings tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the laws of theirs? That is, &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e that matter is more excellent than &s;pirit; the laws of matter more noble than the laws of &s;pi|rit; or the de&s;truction of matter more terrible than the de|&s;truction of &s;pirits? That the divine laws are all culculated for the good of man, is manife&s;t. It will readily appear to any attentive ob&s;erver, that the principal part of our mi&s;eries flows from the wickedne&s;s of man's nature and life. His unruly pa&s;&s;ions have broken loo&s;e from the reins of rea&s;on. They are an overflowing &s;ource of mi&s;ery to him&s;elf and his fellow crea|tures. From whence come wars and fightings among you? &s;ays the apo&s;tle, come they not of your lu&s;ts which war in your members. Whence is it that this world is deluged with human blood? whence the nece&s;&s;ity of gaols and gibbets? whence fraud, cruelty, inju&s;tice, extortion, oppre&s;&s;ion, thefts, robberies, murders and all the works of the fle&s;h mentioned by the Apo&s;|tle, Gal. 5th chap. proceed they not from the wicked heart of man; which is &s;aid to be deceitful above all things and de&s;|perately wicked? Yes, the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God; and is not &s;ubject to his law, neither indeed can be. Out of the heart do proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, thefts, fal&s;e witne&s;s and bla&s;phemies. This is the poi&s;oned fountain which deluges the world with &s;in and mi&s;ery. This is the corrupt tree which bears corrupt fruit in a great abundance. And on the whole, what a happy world would this be; take it in every other way ju&s;t as it is; were men to be and do to them|&s;elves and others, what the laws of God require them to be and do?</P>
<P>It is true man is not governed, and cannot be governed by the &s;ame kind of laws as the irrational and inanimate creatures. No, he mu&s;t be governed by laws &s;uited to his nature whatever
<PB N="7" REF="020203_0006_0FAE3C71447EC5A8">
that be, as they are by laws &s;uited to their nature. Wherein he partakes with them in any thing common to their nature, he is governed by the &s;ame laws. His material body is &s;ubject to the law of gravity or attraction as well as other pieces of matter; and in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to this, his will has no choice; and in many per&s;ons the under&s;tanding no knowledge. He has in|&s;tinctive propen&s;ities in his nature, which are common to him with the brutes, viz. to propagate his &s;pecies and pre&s;erve his life. And as in the&s;e he a&s;cends in the &s;cale of being nearer to intelligence, his under&s;tanding and will have &s;cope for exerci&s;e, in the direction and government of them. It is true, he can no more, by any act of his under&s;tanding and will, eradicate the&s;e propen&s;ities from his nature, than the brutes can; and it is fit and proper it &s;hould be &s;o, they were never intended to be eradicated. They an&s;wer mo&s;t valuable purpo&s;es in God's creation. But they ought to be kept by him under the conduct and guidance of rea&s;on; and mo&s;t certainly a man yielding to the&s;e propen&s;ities without the government of rea&s;on, levels him&s;elf to an equality with the brutes; nay, degrades him&s;elf far below them, for they act according to the complete &s;y&s;tem of laws in their nature; but he does not; his rational and &s;piritual powers are pro&s;trated in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e propen&s;ities above mentioned, clearly belong to his material and animal part. His rational and &s;piritual part mu&s;t be governed in a quite different and far higher manner. Man is a rational, intelligent, a free, and therefore a moral a|gent. He is capable of acting &s;pontaneou&s;ly or from choice; and God will be &s;erved by him agreeably to the exalted rank which he holds in the &s;cale of being, that is, not from nece&s;|&s;ity but choice. In a word, man cannot be governed &s;olely by in&s;tinct, for this good rea&s;on, he is not a brute, nor can he be under a mechanical government, becau&s;e he is not a ma|chine; nor can he be governed by nece&s;&s;ity and force, becau&s;e he is not inanimate matter. Therefore the method which God has taken to govern him (and none other could be &s;uitable to his nature) is, to propo&s;e a law, holy, ju&s;t and good to his rea&s;on, enforce it by his rightful and dread authority, and &s;ecure obedience by a penal &s;anction. The authority of the lawgiver and goodne&s;s of the law, are calculated to gain the a&s;&s;ent of his rea&s;on; the promi&s;e of felicity in ca&s;e of obedience, to engage the con&s;ent of his will; the penal &s;anction to work on his fears, and deter him from di&s;obedience. It is clear that a penal &s;anc|tion
<PB N="8" REF="020203_0007_0FAE3C720F7ECFE8">
is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a moral law; without it there can be no &s;uch law. The precept, if we may on this &s;uppo&s;ition call it &s;o, will amount to no more than a &s;imple advice. If the creature take it, it is well; if not, there is no danger; and thus the will of the creature, not that of the lawgiver is the rule, which will place man totally independent of God. It is further manife&s;t, that if a law once had a penalty annexed to it; but after a while the penalty be taken away; in that ca&s;e we may certainly affirm, the law is repealed; or which a|mounts to the &s;ame thing, if the penalty be not executed in ca&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, there is a total repeal of the law; hence it follows, that the divine goodne&s;s is manife&s;ted not only in giv|ing a law to man, but al&s;o in enforcing obedience by a pe|nal &s;anction, and in executing the penalty in ca&s;e of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. Is the divine goodne&s;s di&s;played in &s;u&s;taining the laws of the material &s;y&s;tem, in &s;upporting this earth in its va|rious revolutions, &s;ea&s;ons and productions? much more in &s;up|porting the moral &s;y&s;tem. Is it manife&s;ted in keeping the brutal tribes in &s;ubjection to the laws of their nature? much more in keeping angels and men &s;ubject to the laws of theirs, or even in taking the wi&s;e&s;t and fitte&s;t mea&s;ures for the pur|po&s;e; better, infinitely better, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, that ten thou&s;and material &s;y&s;tems &s;hould peri&s;h, than that the foun|dations of the moral &s;y&s;tem &s;hould &s;lide and give way, or God's moral government over angels and men &s;hould fail, and on &s;uppo&s;ition of the penalty not being executed in ca&s;e of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t totally fail; the divine law mu&s;t be totally vacated; the precept is violated by the creature, and the penal|ty &s;et a&s;ide by the creator, and thus there is an end of all law; moral government is no more; the divine admini&s;tration is at an end. And let men, if they can, invent any other way to &s;u&s;tain this government, than the one pointed out, that is, any other &s;uited to the nature of angels and men. The voice of rea&s;on proclaims aloud its propriety and fitne&s;s, and revelation a&s;&s;ures us, this is the very way invented by infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by divine authority.</P>
<P>There is a moral fitne&s;s in things, from which the deity can|not depart, from which it would be imperfection in him to de|part. Shall angels and men, intelligent, free and moral agents; be governed in the &s;ame manner as brutes or inanimate matter? it cannot be. Tho&s;e then who would exalt the divine mercy to &s;uch in pitch, as to let &s;in pa&s;s without any adequate puni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="9" REF="020203_0008_0FAE3C76F07238C0">
or in other words &s;et a&s;ide the penalty of the law; would exalt or rather deba&s;e it &s;o as to repeal all the laws of heaven. Mercy would overturn ju&s;tice, overthrow the divine govern|ment, pro&s;trate in the du&s;t Jehovah's throne; di&s;&s;olve the obli|gation of all moral duty; fully the character of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate of heaven and earth; and overwhelm the whole ra|tional creation with &s;in, anarchy, death and ruin. It would (horribile dictu) extingui&s;h all intelligence, God, angels and men! there is no other alternative but one, and that is to make angels and men brutes or inanimate matter: or to &s;ay that there never &s;hould have been in the &s;cale of being &s;uch creatures as angels and men. How tremenduous is the impiety of men, which not only &s;preads di&s;order, confu&s;ion and ruin among the works of God: but thus a&s;&s;aults the throne of the omni|potent him&s;elf!</P>
<P>This world is therefore full of the goodne&s;s of the Lord. It is true it lies in wickedne&s;s and is full of &s;in. But this does not impair or dimini&s;h the divine goodne&s;s. But God manife&s;ts his goodne&s;s like him&s;elf, or in a manner worthy of his divine per|fections. He is good, not only as a Creator and pre&s;erver, but al&s;o as a moral governor. The judge of all the earth will do right. He manife&s;ts his goodne&s;s in a manner adapted to the &s;inful and rebellious &s;tate of the world; in &s;u&s;taining the maje&s;ty of his government, the obligation of his law, the glory of his charac|ter and the whole moral &s;y&s;tem; by the execution of the penal|ty. He will never abdicate nor overturn his own government; nor give his con&s;ent to man's &s;in and rebellion. It cannot be. He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity and cannot look on &s;in. The wages of &s;in is death. He will a&s;&s;ert his own &s;overeignty and dominion; we &s;ee him &s;ometimes taking the work of ven|geance into his own hand, and by the flood de&s;troying the world of the ungodly; by famine, by pe&s;tilence and earth|quakes; laying wa&s;te nations, kingdoms and cities. It is true, there is not an equal di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments in this life. We apprehend the truth on this &s;ubject to be, that there is &s;o much of this di&s;tribution, as clearly to evince there is a God who judgeth in the earth. But at the &s;ame time &s;o much of an inequality in it, as to give full force to the argument, that there mu&s;t be a future &s;tate of retribution; when every work will be brought into judgment, and every &s;ecret thing; and when God will render to every man accord|ing to his works. The my&s;tery of providence will then be fi|ni&s;hed,
<PB N="10" REF="020203_0009_0FAE3C796DA2F008">
all apparent di&s;orders in the divine government recti|fied, and all inequalities made equal. So that light &s;prings from this dark cloud, and the infinite wi&s;dom of God &s;hines in the mid&s;t of this ob&s;curity. For were the di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments here, le&s;s equal, we would not &s;o clearly &s;ee the foot&s;teps of the divine maje&s;ty in his government of the world. Were it more &s;o; we &s;hould want a &s;trong irre|fragable argument from rea&s;on, for the doctrine of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments. God in innumerable in&s;tan|ces &s;hews in this life, that he is not an idle and carele&s;s &s;pectator of the wickedne&s;s of men. This he manife&s;ts in adapting the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence to the moral character of nations, by granting pro&s;perity to the virtuous, and having always a rod of correction or de&s;truction ready for tho&s;e who far exceed in wickedne&s;s. And the &s;ame remark may often be made re|&s;pecting individuals; he makes atrocious vices as certainly con|&s;ume their authors, as fire does the &s;tubble. This is wonderfully verified, in the frequent detection of the unnatural crime of murder; and bringing the perpetrator to condign puni&s;hment even in this life, by a chain of providences which the wi&s;dom of man had no hand in forming, and of which the criminal had neither the &s;malle&s;t fore&s;ight nor fear. But yet it cannot be denied, that irreligion and vice in a certain degree, are many times pro&s;perous and on &s;ome occa&s;ions triumphant; while religion and virtue are oppre&s;&s;ed and borne down. The con|clu&s;ion of rea&s;on is, that to fini&s;h the plan of the divine govern|ment; and fully di&s;play the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of the divine character; there mu&s;t be a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;h|ments. Thus far rea&s;on goes without halting, and while it rea|dily draws this conclu&s;ion, it is beautiful to ob&s;erve the coinci|dence of revelation: its voice confirms it, for God hath ap|pointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteou&s;|ne&s;s, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given a&s;&s;urance to all men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the dead.</P>
<P>It may be objected to this rea&s;oning, that the execution of the penalty annexed to human laws is not always nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;u&s;tentation of government among men. Very true; but in general it is nece&s;&s;ary, and takes place; and were any magi&s;|trate generally to neglect the execution of it, under the pre|tence of mercy; we &s;hould &s;ay he was very weak, very wicked, cruel and unju&s;t. Mercy to criminals would be cruelty and in|ju&s;tice
<PB N="11" REF="020203_0010_0FAE3C79920E5080">
to the community at large. But there is an unavoidable imperfection in all human affairs; human governments cer|tainly partake of this imperfection; their laws are imperfect; their penalties inadequate; and their admini&s;trations defective. Sometimes government is too feeble to bring &s;ome bold and powerful malefactor to ju&s;tice. Sometimes men &s;ee fit to remit the penalty to one, in order to detect and bring to puni&s;hment a greater number. Sometimes only the leaders are capitally puni&s;hed; becau&s;e it is &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e who were in&s;nared by them, were deceived, and therefore not &s;o guilty. Some|times it would weaken a &s;tate too much, were it to puni&s;h all the offenders. This however we may affirm, that wherever we &s;ee governments remitting the penalty of a law, it mu&s;t be owing to &s;ome imperfection or other in the law, the &s;anc|tion, the government, or the character of the governors. For were we to form an idea of a government ab&s;olutely perfect, it would be one which &s;tated a perfect ratio between crimes and puni&s;hments; and in no ca&s;e what&s;oever failed to execute the pe|nalty. It is ab&s;urd therefore to argue from imperfect govern|ments among men, to the perfect government of God. His government is like him&s;elf, infinitely perfect. There can be no defect in his laws, no weakne&s;s in his character, no imper|fection in his admini&s;tration, and accordingly we &s;ee, that par|doning mercy revealed in the go&s;pel, is granted only on the ground of a full and complete atonement, made by Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the &s;inners &s;urety. The penalty had its full effect on him, and thus all the purpo&s;es of maintaining the authority of the divine law, &s;u&s;taining the maje&s;ty of government, and a&s;&s;ert|ing the dignity of the divine character, are fully an&s;wered in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who accept of that atonement; while mercy, infinite mercy reigns in their &s;alvation; becau&s;e their own per|&s;onal characters are as wicked, as vile, and fall as far &s;hort of what the law demands, as if no atonement had been made at all; or as if they had been &s;aved without a regard to any.</P>
<P>But were we even to allow our&s;elves to rea&s;on from imperfect governments among men, to the ab&s;olutely perfect government of God, it would afford but &s;mall ground of hope; for it is e|vident that even according to the cour&s;e of human goverments, but a very few could be pardoned, and it would be totally un|certain, who the&s;e &s;hould be. To talk of repentance as intitling to pardon, is non&s;en&s;e; for this is far from being the ca&s;e, even in the weak imperfect and feeble governments among men. Be&s;ides, if repentance in one, intitle to pardon, certainly re|pentance
<PB N="12" REF="020203_0011_0FAE3C7AED53CA50">
in all will do the &s;ame, otherwi&s;e God would be par|tial and unju&s;t. And as no doubt the criminal, when he &s;ees the mi&s;ery to which he hath reduced him&s;elf, will from a principle of &s;elf-love regret his folly; this would infer the nece&s;&s;ity of remitting the penalty to all, and &s;o put an end to the divine law and government. And on this &s;uppo&s;ition, the divine law would have no penalty, but repentance, which would make the divine government more imperfect than any among men, convert the penalty into a ble&s;&s;ing and rather encourage to &s;in than deter from it. But we &s;ee that men under the divine admini&s;tration may repent, and yet peri&s;h. Judas repented, and yet plunged into ab&s;o|lute de&s;pair. Indeed the go&s;pel repre&s;ents faith and repentance as nece&s;&s;arily, connected with an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t's atonement; and in this connection alone they are available to pardon and &s;alvation. We do not here &s;peak of God's remitting temporal puni&s;hments in the pre&s;ent &s;tate; which &s;tate is preparatory and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e probationary for the grand a&s;&s;ize, the final judgment. As he regards any degree of moral virtue and good order a|mong men, and con&s;equently any degree of repentance and re|formation; he may for a time remit the temporal puni&s;hment, and give them longer time. Thus he &s;pared Nineveh when pe|nitent. One grand de&s;ign of the divine di&s;pen&s;ations in this &s;tate, is to prepare the world for the day of judgment and final retribution, that the wicked may be inexcu&s;able at that day. But not one in&s;tance in all the book of God can be produced, which will prove, that repentance alone will avail at that awful day. See Proverbs, chap. I. 24&mdash;33.</P>
<P>On this &s;cheme of rea&s;oning, we &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;a|crifice and atonement of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If mercy be manife&s;ted to the &s;inner, let it be honourable mercy, comporting with the glory of the divine character, his &s;potle&s;s holine&s;s and perfect ju&s;tice: mercy con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of his law, the &s;upport of his government and the good of the rational and moral world. Not &s;uch mercy as would annihilate all government, overturn all ju&s;tice, repeal every moral precept, &s;ubvert all order and equity, put a final period to the moral &s;y&s;tem, de|throne God, de&s;troy angels and men, and convert the whole intelligent and rational creation into a ma&s;s of &s;in, iniquity and ruin.</P>
<P>The authors and abettors of the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alva|tion, would do well &s;olemnly to ponder the&s;e things, lea&s;t un|der the pretext of exalting the divine mercy, they be found
<PB N="13" REF="020203_0012_0FAE3C7AF656EF38">
pleading wickedly for God and talking deceitfully for him. There have appeared two &s;chemes of that doctrine; one is, that there will be no puni&s;hment at all in a future &s;tate; the other allows that there will; but maintains that the wicked &s;hall be all purified in hell, and after pa&s;&s;ing through, perhaps, many &s;tates of torment, &s;hall all finally, &s;ome &s;ooner, &s;ome later, e&s;cape to glory and felicity. The two &s;chemes are not e&s;|&s;entially different; they differ only as to the time of &s;alva|tion. The fir&s;t is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the principles of the divine government &s;tated above. It &s;ubverts the principles of natural religion and moral government. In effect denies a day of judgment, and a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments; goes on the fal&s;e hypothe&s;is that there is an equal di&s;tribution of the&s;e in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, or al|lows the divine government to &s;ink under the charge of ini|quity and inju&s;tice; contradicts every doctrine and every de|claration of the bible relative to the &s;ubject. It is the doctrine of &s;adducees, epicureans, &s;ceptics, dei&s;ts, athei&s;ts; bears the mo&s;t malignant a&s;pect towards the order, purity and peace of civil &s;ociety, while it is manife&s;t, that it can be of no &s;ervice to men, either in this life or that which is to come; for were it true, tho&s;e who deny it, are in no danger; but if fal&s;e, as mo&s;t certainly it is, how dreadfully pernicious! In &s;hort it is &s;uch a chaos of ab&s;urdity, impiety and non&s;en&s;e, that it is truly a&s;|toni&s;hing any rational creature &s;hould be involved in a moments doubt about it. The &s;econd &s;cheme is at fir&s;t appearance more plau&s;ible, and therefore likely to have a wider range. We &s;hall therefore make a few &s;trictures on it. They begin with telling us, that the Hebrew and Greek words tran&s;lated <HI>eternal, everla&s;ting,</HI> and, <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> are &s;ometimes applied to a limited duration, and &s;ignify in many in&s;tances no more than a long period; and therefore when applied to hell torments mu&s;t mean no more. This would be fine rea&s;oning. In &s;ome ca&s;es they &s;ignify no more; therefore they can &s;ignify no more in this ca&s;e. In &s;ome ca&s;es it is extremely wicked to take away a man's life; therefore it is extremely wicked to do &s;o in the ca&s;e of lawful war; or in pur&s;uance of a ju&s;t &s;entence of a ju|dicial court. The authors of the &s;cheme cannot deny, that the&s;e words &s;ometimes point out a proper eternity or endle&s;s duration; becau&s;e the &s;ame words are u&s;ed to expre&s;s the du|ration and perfections of the deity. They cannot be ignorant that in all languages words are u&s;ed both in a proper and fi|gurative &s;en&s;e. When we hear the everla&s;ting hills mentioned,
<PB N="14" REF="020203_0013_0FAE3C7BAE4E5AD8">
common &s;en&s;e teaches, that the phra&s;e is figurative. When an Engli&s;hman &s;ays, I am infinitely or eternally obliged to you; every body knows he &s;peaks figuratively and u&s;es the&s;e words in an improper &s;en&s;e. What is the true, proper and &s;trict mean|ing of the words, <HI>everla&s;ting, eternal,</HI> and <HI>for ever and ever?</HI> Is it not an endle&s;s duration? If this then be their proper mean|ing, how will they prove that they are u&s;ed in a figurative and not in their proper &s;en&s;e, when applied to hell torments? But they will &s;ay we cannot prove, that when &s;o applied, the words mu&s;t mean an endle&s;s duration. This however we will attempt. There is no way to determine when they are u&s;ed figuratively or properly; but by attending to the &s;ubject to which they are applied. If applied to any thing in this world, or in this life, they mu&s;t be u&s;ed figuratively; but when ap|plied to any thing in the other world, or in a future &s;tate, they mu&s;t be u&s;ed in their &s;trict proper &s;en&s;e. Now hell torments appertain not to this world, but the next, not to time but to e|ternity. There mu&s;t be an e&s;&s;ential difference between the mode of duration called time, and the mode of duration called eter|nity. This difference we cannot define with certainty, becau&s;e we are acquainted only with the fir&s;t. An able writer has at|tempted it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Soame Jenyns,</HI> E&s;q. one of the lords of trade in Britain.</NOTE>. We acquire &s;ays he, the idea of time, by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of ideas; but &s;ome have called eternity, a <HI>&s;tanding point, an everla&s;ting Now.</HI> Common &s;en&s;e however teaches, that eter|nity mu&s;t be e&s;&s;entially different from time, and therefore if there be any future happine&s;s or puni&s;hment at all, they mu&s;t be eternal. The new &s;cheme is ab&s;urd in this, that its authors &s;uppo&s;e men &s;till to be in time, after they are departed out of time into eternity; that is they &s;uppo&s;e time to be eternity, and eternity time. It is certain that hell torments never point out a time-puni&s;hment, but an eternal one.</P>
<P>The advocates for this dangerous doctrine plead the &s;atisfac|tion and atonement of Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the foundation of their opinion, and if that were embraced and accepted by all men; doubtle&s;s all men would be &s;aved by it. But the go&s;pel tells us, and facts confirm the truth; that many reject it. The &s;ame go&s;pel a&s;&s;ures us, that if this atonement be rejected, in&s;tead of being &s;aved by it; this rejection will aggravate mo&s;t terribly the condemnation of the rejectors. How &s;hall we e&s;cape if we ne|glect &s;o great a &s;alvation? if he that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es law, died without mercy under two or three witne&s;&s;es; of how much &s;orer
<PB N="15" REF="020203_0014_0FAE3C7CA40C2E10">
puni&s;hment, &s;uppo&s;e he ye, &s;hall be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and hath done de&s;pite to the &s;pirit of grace? but the univer&s;ali&s;ts tell us, the&s;e and other texts to the &s;ame purpo&s;e do not move them. The merit of Chri&s;t's obedience and death is infinite. He has paid the debt of the whole human race. They owe nothing to God; but God owes every thing to them; happine&s;s in this world and eternal life in the world to come. God is now the debtor and they the creditors. His full due is paid; yea more, he is enriched by the payment. Their debt was but finite. He has got an infinite reimbur&s;ement. Let men live as they li&s;t; wantonly violate the divine law or &s;tudiou&s;ly keep it; it is all one. God has no ju&s;t demands on them. It would be inju&s;tice in him to find fault; at lea&s;t the height of inju&s;tice to puni&s;h them eternally. Perhaps, &s;ay &s;ome, impenitent &s;inners may &s;uffer a few years in the other world; but an eternity of happine&s;s mu&s;t follow that period; in compari&s;on of which eternity, many years or ages of &s;uffering will be only as the drop of a bucket compared to the ocean. If it were po&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on with men in &s;uch a reverie, we might pau&s;e a moment and a&s;k: is there any &s;uch language in all the book of God? what wealth did God lo&s;e by man's di&s;obedience? How much poorer did he become? what riches are re&s;tored to him by Je&s;us Chri&s;t? what profit accrues to the almighty by the &s;ervice or righteou&s;ne&s;s of any? can a man be profitable to God as he that is wi&s;e may be pro|fitable to him&s;elf? Is it any gain to the almighty that thou art righteous? and is not Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf the mighty God and everla&s;ting Father? any que&s;tion about wealth, property, debt, or commercial ju&s;tice, is altogether foreign to the purpo&s;e here.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o ab&s;urd to argue, that becau&s;e Chri&s;t's merit is in|finite; therefore it mu&s;t extend to the whole human race; for by the &s;ame argument it mu&s;t extend to all the devils; and if it be &s;aid, God did not &s;ee it proper to include them in the appointment of Chri&s;t's death, it may be readily an&s;wered, this overthrows the argument which is built on the infinite merit of Chri&s;t, and places it on the divine &s;overeignty. And it is cer|tain the &s;criptures a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame &s;overeignty in the appoint|ment and acceptance of the death of Chri&s;t only for tho&s;e who &s;hould accept or embrace it. The truth is, the nece&s;&s;ity of an in|finite atonement does not ari&s;e from the number, but nature of &s;in. An infinite atonement is as nece&s;&s;ary to the pardon of
<PB N="16" REF="020203_0015_0FAE3C7D297EB9F8">
one &s;in, as ten thou&s;and; and its end may be gained as com|pletely in the one ca&s;e as the other. He that offends in one point is guilty of all, &s;ays James. Numbers do not vary the nature or kind. Sin is ju&s;tly &s;aid to be an infinite evil. See what one &s;in in our fir&s;t parents did. It brought ruin on the whole world. It defaced the image of God on man, corrupted his nature, involved him and all his po&s;terity in a &s;ad moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning &s;till more and more; which is a part of the cur&s;e as well as penal evil, and is the very thing meant by &s;piritual or moral death, that is, men are wicked becau&s;e they will not be good, their carnal minds are enmity again&s;t it; which is no excu&s;e for &s;in, but an aggrava|tion of it. It has expo&s;ed the whole human race to innumer|able mi&s;eries in this life, to death it&s;elf, and to the pains of hell for ever. And take any one &s;in committed by any of all the human race, and &s;uppo&s;e it the fir&s;t &s;in in the world; it would produce the &s;ame effects on him and his po&s;terity. The fir&s;t &s;in of the rebel angels was equally fatal. The connection between &s;in and perdition does not ari&s;e only from the appointment of heaven, but from the nature of the thing. For as the earth, in her diurnal revolution, turning her face from the &s;un, is nece&s;&s;arily involved in darkne&s;s; by an equal or greater nece&s;|&s;ity, a &s;pirit revolting from God, is involved in darkne&s;s death and ruin. The end and de&s;ign of the death of Chri&s;t has been already pointed out, viz. the manife&s;tation of the glory of the divine character, the &s;u&s;taining of his moral government, the honour and obligation of his law, while he pardons &s;in. Now this end would be gained effectually in he &s;alvation of one &s;inner; and Chri&s;t's atonement would have been nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;alvation of that one.</P>
<P>Can it be inju&s;tice in God then, to puni&s;h eternally tho&s;e who reject that atonement? far from it. Nay, we may af|firm, the great judge of heaven and earth Je&s;us Chri&s;t, would do no act of di&s;tributive or per&s;onal inju&s;tice to true believers, were he to ca&s;t them into utter darkne&s;s and puni&s;h them for their &s;ins eternally in hell, his atonement and their faith in it notwith&s;tanding. The inju&s;tice in this ca&s;e (if any) would be done to him&s;elf, in &s;ubmitting to puni&s;hment which he did not de&s;erve. Their &s;alvation is not an act of &s;trict di&s;tributive or per&s;onal ju&s;tice; but of mere rich &s;overeign grace.</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of the imputation of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s to believers, it would be ab&s;urd to under&s;tand it, as if the act of righteou&s;ne&s;s were transferred from the &s;aviour to the &s;in|ner,
<PB N="17" REF="020203_0016_0FAE3C7DEA6AAC50">
&s;o as to become the &s;inner's per&s;onal act. Nor is it le&s;s ab&s;urd to &s;ay, Chri&s;t's merit is transferred. Merit and deme|rit are per&s;onal qualities, which can never be transferred per|&s;onally from one to another; they mu&s;t forever adhere to the &s;ubjects of the one and the other. Riches or wealth may be transferred; but moral good and turpitude cannot &s;hift hands &s;o. When we &s;peak of the imputation of &s;in to Chri&s;t, it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, the act of &s;in or even the turpitude of it, was transferred to Chri&s;t; or that the ill de&s;ert of it became per&s;onally his ill de&s;ert. He was the Father's beloved Son, his delight, and de&s;erved the highe&s;t glory, even when &s;uf|fering the deepe&s;t ignominy. And when we affirm the non|imputation of &s;in and the imputation of righteou&s;ne&s;s to be|lievers, it cannot mean, that the act of &s;in is no more; for what is done cannot be undone; nor is the ill de&s;ert of &s;in an|nihilated. Even when they are accounted righteous and treat|ed accordingly, they are per&s;onally de&s;erving of hell; and this is what makes free grace con&s;picuous in their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>It may be therefore affirmed, that no inju&s;tice taken in a &s;trict di&s;tributive &s;en&s;e, would be done to true believers; were they to be ca&s;t for ever into hell. What inju&s;tice then can be done to unbelievers who reject the atonement; though Chri&s;t reject them. Do not many of them account it fooli&s;hne&s;s? do not they de&s;pi&s;e and mock it? have not many of them vi|olently per&s;ecuted Chri&s;t and tho&s;e who followed him?</P>
<P>It is to no purpo&s;e to &s;ay here, that his go&s;pel is not preach|ed to all men; and therefore multitudes of men cannot &s;purn or reject it; for it is certain, thrice at lea&s;t, &s;alvation through him has been publi&s;hed to all men. It is incontrovertible that Adam taught it to his po&s;terity. And again Noah a preach|er of righteou&s;ne&s;s to his children. We can entertain no ra|tional doubt of this. How then did they lo&s;e it? through the enmity and oppo&s;ition of their own hearts to it; by their own pride, perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s. Some great man among them, con&s;picuous for his genius and abilities; &s;ome noted dei&s;t, &s;ome Hume, Voltaire, or Herbert, would in the pride of his heart de&s;pi&s;e the divine coun&s;els; pronounce them fooli&s;h|ne&s;s and promi&s;e to &s;hew the people a better way. They ad|miring his genius and boldne&s;s, would, through the pride of their hearts and wi&s;hing to re&s;emble &s;uch a Colo&s;&s;us as much as po&s;&s;ible, li&s;ten to him with earne&s;t attention, and embrace his &s;cheme. Some Nimrod or Jeroboam wi&s;hing to e&s;tabli&s;h his tyranny on the ruins of the peoples liberties, would &s;tudy to &s;ink them in ignorance and blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;inn to his will.
<PB N="18" REF="020203_0017_0FAE3C7EDCAAE5D0">
Thus Jeroboam would not permit I&s;rael to go up to Jeru&s;alem to wor&s;hip the true God, lea&s;t it &s;hould alienate their hearts from his government; and this finally &s;unk them in ignorance, idolatry and ruin. Again after the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, the go&s;pel was publi&s;hed to all nations. Go, &s;ays Chri&s;t to his di&s;|ciples, into all the world and preach the go&s;pel to every crea|ture. That this was verily done, we have authentic evidence from hi&s;tory. In A&s;ia, in Europe, and Africa, famous churches were erected; where now heathen and mahometan darkne&s;s reigns. How came they to lo&s;e the ine&s;timable privilege? be|cau&s;e they did not value it, did not think it worthy of reten|tion. The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God, and is not &s;ub|ject to his law, neither indeed can be. There is a &s;urpri&s;ing proclivity in the human heart to revolt from God. Facts uni|ver&s;ally confirm this, e&s;pecially the three great apo&s;ta&s;ies; after Adam, Noah and the apo&s;tolic age. God cannot and will not force mercies on men.</P>
<P>It is ridiculous to hear men talking in the form univer&s;al|i&s;ts do. Let us look to the great men in our day; do they e&s;|teem the go&s;pel as a privilege worth retaining? are not many of them profe&s;&s;ed or in part concealed dei&s;ts? do not they make their &s;port of the go&s;pel in conver&s;ation and writing? do they not neglect the public ordinances of religion, and account it a mean thing to &s;it at Je&s;us feet and hear his words? are there not many &s;uch in the city of Philadelphia? are they not doing what they can to bani&s;h the go&s;pel and with it the chri&s;tian religion from the land? do not many who pretend to literature, prefer the philo&s;ophy of Greece and Rome to the philo&s;ophy of Je&s;us? and the writings of Tacitus, Livy, Homer and Virgil, to the Bible? while many, who profe&s;s to believe the go&s;pel, corrupt its principles and di&s;honour it in their practice. The go&s;pel is the butt of the enmity and oppo&s;ition of all men except a few. All things on earth con&s;pire to prevent its taking root where it is not, and to tear it from the place where it is. It is a won|der, it is not quite bani&s;hed from the world; and were it not for the divine mercy and power, this would &s;oon be the ca&s;e. This &s;ingular remark may be made concerning the bible, that there is no other book in the world, which all men have con|&s;pired to render u&s;ele&s;s as they have it; which, con&s;idering the depravity of human nature, is no ob&s;cure proof that it is of God. A very great majority of Chri&s;tians &s;o called, from a principle of pretended reverence for it, think it ought to be &s;ecreted from the people; the Roman Catholics think it is too
<PB N="19" REF="020203_0018_0FAE3C8363F8C550">
holy to be touched by the profane vulgar. Many who do not e&s;pou&s;e that principle, let it lye by neglected in their hou&s;es, while learned dei&s;ts and profane mockers, from age to age, are writing and &s;peaking reproachfully of it. Would not God be ju&s;t in giving up &s;uch men to their own hearts lu&s;ts, and in allowing them to return to their beloved regions of heathen darkne&s;s? would it be inju&s;tice in God to &s;wear in his wrath, concerning all the dei&s;ts and neglectors of religion in Philadel|phia and el&s;ewhere? you &s;hall never be permitted again to &s;ee the bible, nor to ob&s;erve one &s;abbath; nor celebrate one &s;acra|ment; nor pre&s;ent one prayer to me; neither you nor your po&s;|terity. Could or would the&s;e men complain? would they not obtain their hearts wi&s;h? It is certain many in effect pa&s;s this &s;entence again&s;t them&s;elves and fix the &s;ame doom as far as in their power on their po&s;terity. It is clear, the conduct of na|tions in the&s;e affairs and indeed of the heads of families in an inferior degree, mu&s;t always involve the fate of their po&s;terity. The con&s;equences of their conduct mu&s;t unavoidably de&s;cend to their children. For in&s;tance, does the parent of a family prac|ti&s;e no religious wor&s;hip in his hou&s;e; it is more than probable his children will copy after his example; and when they be|come parents, each of them will &s;et the &s;ame pattern of infi|delity before their children; and the&s;e again in their turn be|fore theirs. And thus one irreligious parent begins the cur|rent, which widens, deepens, and rolls on like a great river of death; &s;preading de&s;olation wherever it goes, and never ends, 'till &s;wallowed up in the dead &s;ea of eternal perdition. This &s;hould make the primores regni the chiefs of a nation, and heads of families, extremely cautious and circum&s;pect in &s;uch matters; becau&s;e they reject and forfeit not only for them&s;elves; but al&s;o for their po&s;terity; and it is manife&s;t great revolu|tions in nations cannot take place ea&s;ily or in one day.</P>
<P>It may be not improperly added here, that the go&s;pel has been frequently offered to the Indian tribes in this country. Have they di&s;covered a propen&s;ity to accept it? or rather have they not very generally rejected it? and have not dei&s;ts and profane chri&s;tians hardened them again&s;t it? We are apt to find fault with divine providence, when the blame lies entirely at our own door. How &s;hocking and tremenduous after all this&mdash;af|ter all men, except a few, are thus acting in harmony and con|cert, to render the go&s;pel abortive or un&s;ucce&s;sfull in this world, yea to bani&s;h it from the world, by the pride, enmity, athe|i&s;m and other lu&s;ts of their own hearts; to hear them pre|tending
<PB N="20" REF="020203_0019_0FAE3C85C1436CE0">
to &s;uch benevolence to mankind, as to plead, there mu&s;t be a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel in hell; and that other|wi&s;e God would be cruel and unju&s;t! Were it really to be &s;o, and the&s;e men retaining the &s;ame temper there as here, they would devi&s;e means to render it abortive there too. But &s;uch perver&s;e rea&s;oning is &s;o wicked, that the mind of man cannot conceive it. Language fails to give it utterance. It is a full proof, that the heart of man is de&s;perately wicked and de|ceitful above all things. Ju&s;tice, &s;trict and per&s;onal ju&s;tice then, does not require the &s;alvation even of true believers. It would not be inju&s;tice in Chri&s;t to ca&s;t them into hell for their &s;ins and puni&s;h them eternally. Their ill de&s;ert is not and cannot be taken away; nor is his merit &s;o imputed to them as to become their per&s;onal merit, or to make them per&s;onally as righteous as he is. This cannot be in the nature of things. But while their ill de&s;ert remains, his merit is &s;u&s;tained in law as the ground or rea&s;on of their eternal &s;alvation. Ju&s;tice, it is true, does not forbid their &s;alvation, every ob&s;tacle from that quarter is removed by the atonement and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. It is con&s;i&s;tent enough with the glory of God, the ho|nour of his law and government, to &s;ave them; but their &s;al|vation is an act of rich grace and mere mercy; and this grace requires it, and God's faithful promi&s;e &s;ecures it. Were any thing more nece&s;&s;ary to be added, we might &s;ubjoin, that ge|neral or public, not &s;trict di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, makes their &s;al|vation nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>On what &s;hadow of &s;ound rea&s;oning then, can it be pleaded, that ju&s;tice, &s;trict ju&s;tice requires the &s;alvation of tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who reject the councils of God again&s;t their own &s;ouls; who trample under foot his precious blood and do de&s;pite to the &s;pirit of grace; who force their way to hell, taking their po&s;terity with them, again&s;t go&s;pel light! go&s;pel grace and mercy! Ju&s;tice require their &s;alvation!! Ju&s;tice in every &s;en&s;e require their damnation. Di&s;tributive ju&s;tice demands it! public ju&s;tice demands it! &s;purned love, de&s;pi&s;ed blood, affronted mercy demand it! and the word of God declares it &s;hall be infallibly executed.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of God the Father, in committing the admini&s;|tration of affairs in this world to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the mediator and his Eternal Son, &s;eems to be, that the &s;on might &s;ubdue all things to him&s;elf, or bring all things which the &s;in and rebel|lion of angels and men had thrown into the greate&s;t di&s;order, back again under the dominion of law and ju&s;tice.

ob&s;curely pointed forth by the Apo&s;tle, 1 Corinth. 15&mdash;24&mdash;28. Then cometh the end, when he &s;hall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father; when he &s;hall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he mu&s;t reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet, and when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto him, &amp;c. The apo&s;tle evidently refers unto that notable pa&s;&s;age in the 110 P&s;alm. Sit thou at my right hand, &s;ays the eternal Fa|ther to his beloved Son, until I make thine enemies thy foot|&s;tool; which may be thus paraphra&s;ed, I give unto thee my &s;on, all power in heaven and earth, and inve&s;t thee with the full and ab&s;olute admini&s;tration of affairs in my kingdom, until I by thy agency have put all rebellion down, reduced all things back again under the dominion of law and ju&s;tice, or put all mine and thine enemies under thy feet; and then &s;halt thou deliver up the kingdom to me without any thing to hurt or offend in it, every &s;uch thing being ca&s;t out.</P>
<P>It appears to have been a common &s;aying among the Jews that the Me&s;&s;iah when he cometh will re&s;tore all things. There are two ways in which Chri&s;t carries this de&s;ign into execution and will finally accompli&s;h it. The fir&s;t is by a work of grace on true believers; by which their minds are enlightened in the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;ee the infinite evil of &s;in, are brought to hate it with a perfect hatred and turn from it with full purpo&s;e of heart and endeav|our after new obedience; voluntarily &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the infinite mercy of God, as it reigns through the atonement; acquie&s;ce, cordially acquie&s;ce in the divine law as holy, ju&s;t and good both in precept and penalty; become reconciled to God's perfections, God's providence and God's moral government. Per&s;ons of this de&s;cription &s;hall be eternally &s;aved. Their &s;al|vation commences in this life, it begins in their &s;aving con|ver&s;ion to God, in the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, the adoption of their per&s;ons, and acceptance of their feeble imperfect but &s;incere &s;ervices. They are pre&s;erved in Chri&s;t Je&s;us and kept by the power of God through faith unto &s;alvation. Their whole dependence is placed on the grace of God in Chri&s;t, and to that and that alone they will a&s;cribe all the glory of it through all eternity. But there is another cla&s;s and a very numerous one too, who know not God nor obey the go&s;pel of his Son, who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord and the glory of his power.

They &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light here, but will lift them up in hell being in torment; and an impa&s;&s;able gulph will be fixed between believers and them. They would not know nor believe, under the admini&s;tration of the go&s;pel, that God infinitely hates &s;in and will certainly puni&s;h it; but will and mu&s;t know it, to their eternal co&s;t under the mini&s;tration of wrath. They, by the pride of their hearts, rejected free ju&s;|tification through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, &s;purned his love, de&s;pi&s;ed his blood and did de&s;pite to his &s;pirit of grace. They adhered to the law, tru&s;ted to their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, ven|tured down the &s;tream of life and launched into the ocean of eternity on that plank. All their life long they per&s;i&s;ted in appealing to the law, and to the law they mu&s;t go, and by it be judged at the tribunal of God. Their pretended religion and virtue were put in the Saviour's place, and exalted to his throne to the utter rejection of the go&s;pel and of law and ju&s;tice likewi&s;e. Will God acquit &s;uch at his bar? will he clear the guilty? will he overthrow his glorious go&s;pel and his holy law both at once? will he ju&s;tify &s;inners as they do them&s;elves? on account of what? righteou&s;ne&s;s? no; but wickedne&s;s. For what greater wickedne&s;s can be imagined, than to reject the coun&s;els of infinite wi&s;dom and infinite love? what greater wickedne&s;s than while they do this, to attempt to an&s;wer the demands of the law by their own imperfect and polluted frag|ments of imaginary merit? while it is certain they never per|formed one duty from proper principles, holy motives, nor di|rected it to a rea&s;onable and proper end, the glory of their creator. Chri&s;t will put &s;uch down; will put them under his feet, will ca&s;t them forth into utter darkne&s;s and eternal per|dition. They will be &s;ubdued under law and ju&s;tice indeed, but it will be by their &s;uffering the penalty and enduring the cur&s;e of the law. Darkne&s;s and de&s;pair will enclo&s;e them round. And they will be involved in a dreadful moral nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;inning and &s;uffering &s;till more and more, but in &s;uch a manner as not any longer to &s;pread the infection of &s;in, and di&s;turb the order of the kingdom of peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s. This moral nece&s;&s;ity will con&s;i&s;t in an unconquerable aver&s;ion of the heart from God and enmity again&s;t him; which is the true &s;piritual idea of &s;piritual or moral death; and this death will eternally have dominion over them.</P>
<P>It is certainly a part of our authors &s;cheme, though they do not &s;peak it out, that there will be a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel in hell, there the throne of grace will be erected; the mercy-&s;eat

revealed; that men &s;hall enter on a &s;econd probation|ary &s;tate after death; and perhaps &s;ome go through ten or ten thou&s;and &s;uch probations. Is not this altogether vi|&s;ionary? what foundation in God's word for &s;uch a notion? the bible &s;ays <HI>now</HI> is the accepted time, <HI>now</HI> is the day of &s;alvation. <HI>To day</HI> if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. If we &s;in wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;in: but a certain fearfull looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation which &s;hall de|vour the adver&s;aries. for it is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who were once enlightened, and have ta&s;ted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t, and have ta&s;ted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they &s;hall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; &s;eeing they crucify to them&s;elves the &s;on of God afre&s;h, and put him to an open &s;hame. Becau&s;e I have called, and ye refu&s;ed, I have &s;tretched out my hand, and no man regarded. But ye have &s;et at nought all my coun&s;el, and would none of my re|proof; I al&s;o will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh: When your fear cometh as de&s;olation, and your de&s;truction cometh as a whirlwind; when di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h cometh upon you. Then &s;hall they call upon me, but I will not an&s;wer; they &s;hall &s;eek me early, but they &s;hall not find me: for that he hated knowledge, and did not choo&s;e the fear of the Lord. They would none of my coun&s;el; they de|&s;pi&s;ed all my reproof. Therefore &s;hall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the &s;imple &s;hall &s;lay them, and the pro&s;perity of fools &s;hall de&s;troy them. There is a &s;in unto death, &s;ays John, I do not &s;ay that ye &s;hall pray for it. The apo&s;tle judged it would be di&s;plea&s;ing to God, to pray for &s;ome men even in this Life. But if the &s;cheme of our innovators be true, there is no impropriety in praying for all the damned in hell; that God would &s;anctify their torments to their purification; that he would mitigate and &s;horten them as much as po&s;&s;ible. How &s;hocking is error!</P>
<P>Our authors tell us, that the wicked &s;hall be purified in hell and &s;o fitted for heaven. Here they acknowledge, that in hell they mu&s;t be in a &s;inful and morally deprav|ed &s;tate, at lea&s;t for a con&s;iderable time; that is, until the force of hell-fire purge off their impurity; and al&s;o, that the inha|bitants of glory mu&s;t be in a &s;tate perfectly holy and pure; and that the impure cannot join the &s;ociety of the pure and holy, until they be clean&s;ed and purified. Indeed this is &s;o well &s;up|ported
<PB N="24" REF="020203_0023_0FAE3C8877AFD430">
in &s;cripture and &s;o con&s;onant to rea&s;on, that it could not well be denied. Now here the que&s;tion is, what &s;hall be the efficient cau&s;e of their purification? who &s;hall be the agent in this bu&s;ine&s;s? we can think only of two or three, one or other of which it mu&s;t be; either the &s;pirit of God; or hell-fire; or them&s;elves. The &s;criptures a&s;cribe &s;oul purification en|tirely and only to the &s;pirit of grace. Except a man be born of the &s;pirit, &s;ays Chri&s;t, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the &s;pirit is &s;pirit, and that which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h. Not by might nor by power but by my &s;pirit &s;aith the Lord. If any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t he is none of his. If ye through the &s;pirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye &s;hall live. It is true the operations of the &s;pirit in &s;oul-purification are compared, to the operation and efficacy of water and fire to clean&s;e and purge ma|terial filth from material &s;ubjects: but the&s;e are only emblems; the one referring to bapti&s;m, which is only an outward &s;ign of moral purification; as when he &s;ays except ye be born of the water and of the &s;pirit, &amp;c. corre&s;ponding with another text, he that believeth and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved. In the other emblem, to wit, fire, there is an allu&s;ion to I&s;aiah 6&mdash;6. Then flew one of the &s;eraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar, and he laid it upon my mouth, and &s;aid; lo! this hath touched thy lips, &amp;c. accordingly John the bapti&s;t a&s;&s;ures the di&s;ciples of the Lord that they &s;hould be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t as with fire. This evidently had its accompli&s;hment, when the holy Spirit de&s;cended on them at penteco&s;t in the &s;hape of cloven tongues of fire. By this &s;pirit their hearts were in|flamed with love and holy zeal, and the miraculous power of &s;peaking all languages was communicated to them. The prophet and they were fitted and qualified, for the execution of their offices, by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t. By his divine influ|ence they were purified from &s;in, animated with love and holy zeal, their tongues tipt with heavenly fire and made like flaming torches to di&s;pen&s;e light and warm life through the churches of God. And it is remarkable, that Chri&s;t when delivering this pro|mi&s;e after his re&s;urrection, drops the emblem of fire, and only &s;ays, ye &s;hall be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, Acts 1. If then we a&s;cribe the purification of the damn'd in hell to the agency of the &s;pirit of grace; God's gracious pre&s;ence mu&s;t be in hell, which would turn hell into heaven; and on this &s;uppo&s;ition, that word is
<PB N="25" REF="020203_0024_0FAE3C8ACB817AF8">
not true, depart ye cur&s;ed, &amp;c. nor that, they &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the <HI>pre&s;ence</HI> of the Lord, &amp;c. 2 The&s;. 1&mdash;9. nor that word, my &s;pirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man; that prayer is vain, ca&s;t me not away from thy pre&s;ence, nor take thy holy &s;pirit from me, P&s;alm 51. the&s;e exhortations have no meaning, grieve not the &s;pirit, quench not the &s;pirit, re&s;i&s;t not the &s;pirit. It follows, that if God's word be true, we cannot a&s;cribe the purification of the damned to the &s;ole agent in &s;oul-purification; the &s;pirit of grace. Their puri|fication mu&s;t therefore be a&s;cribed to the torments of hell alone. But how ab&s;urd the idea! that mere torment or puni&s;hment will conciliate love to the puni&s;her. What is &s;oul-purification? it is holine&s;s. What is holine&s;s? it is conformity to the law of God. What is conformity to the law of God? it is love. For Chri&s;t &s;ums up the whole law in the&s;e two, &s;upreme love to God and love to our neighbour as to our&s;elves. But it is love that begets love. We love him becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us. Mere torment will never beget love. Some raving advocates for the doctrine again&s;t which we contend, drop in their argu|ment, the idea of &s;piritual or moral purification; and &s;ub&s;titute in its place, the purification of body or matter; and tell us that fire and brim&s;tone con&s;titute a fine chymical preparation for this purpo&s;e. But this drollery and non&s;en&s;e is too profound, to merit a &s;erious an&s;wer. It is certain that devils have not bodies of clay. A &s;pirit hath not fle&s;h and bones as ye &s;ee me have, &s;ays Chri&s;t. Be&s;ides, fire and brim&s;tone; the lake of fire; are figurative expre&s;&s;ions, pointing forth the poignancy of the torments of the damned: as on the contrary, the felicity of heaven is pointed out by a throne, a crown, a river of life and a tree of life. The be&s;t &s;criptural idea of the&s;e torments, which we can form, is, that they con&s;i&s;t in angui&s;h, horror, de&s;pair, rage, enmity and fury. And how the&s;e torments will trans|form the &s;oul into love is not ea&s;y to &s;ee. It is certain that the&s;e are the torments of &s;uch as are made &s;ignal monu|ments of divine wrath in this life. Here permit me to intro|duce a &s;tory from my own per&s;onal knowledge, the truth of which I can avouch by the te&s;timony of &s;cores of living wit|ne&s;&s;es. There lived in the &s;tate of New-York, a few years ago, a &s;en&s;ible intelligent man, who&s;e name it is proper to conceal. He with &s;ome others, laid a plot to ma&s;&s;acre a number of in|dians, who during the former war between Britain and France, retreated into the &s;ettlements of the white people, as being
<PB N="26" REF="020203_0025_0FAE3C8B7785CE60">
peaceably di&s;po&s;ed towards the colonies. The wicked men did this under the pretext of the&s;e Indians holding a corre&s;pondence with their brethren at war. He and his club having prepared them&s;elves with &s;trong drink, for the execution of the infernal project, went in the night and barbarou&s;ly murdered the mo&s;t of the poor &s;avages. The bla&s;ting cur&s;e of God vi&s;ibly fell upon the per&s;ons or property of the whole bloody band. The man of whom I &s;peak after &s;ome time took up with a woman of indifferent fame, &s;aid he was married to her, and had &s;everal children by her. It was whi&s;pered among the people, that they were not married. He &s;aid they were, and threatened to pro|&s;ecute at law any who would affirm the contrary. But the &s;u&s;picion was &s;o &s;trong, that he could not get bapti&s;m to his children. He told me him&s;elf, that he then determined to bap|tize them him&s;elf; and, &s;ays he, as I felt &s;ome horror at the thoughts of doing it; I made my&s;elf drunk for the purpo&s;e, and went through with it; baptizing them in the name of the Trinity. Then, added he, my trouble was completed. The &s;pirit of God entirely for&s;ook me. I have committed the &s;in unto death; there is no mercy for me, and I wi&s;h for none, yea &s;ays he, I wi&s;h for none. Soon after he had done the la&s;t &s;hocking deed; he parted from his woman; bound out his children; and he told me, that one day in a fit of raging de|&s;pair, when reflecting on his coveting earthly things and what that and other lu&s;ts had brought him to. He took a parcel of paper money, went and &s;tamped it in a &s;wamp. But O! the livid horrors which disfigured his countenance! he was &s;trong, healthy, intelligent and a good &s;cholar; but &s;oon became pale, meagre, haggard, wild in his looks, with his hair bri&s;tling out. He would repeat many terrible words from the bible again&s;t him&s;elf, and tell me, hell was his eternal portion. I endea|voured to comfort him with the con&s;olations of the go&s;pel, preached to him, prayed for him, and exhorted him to pray for him&s;elf, but in vain! He often attempted to murder him&s;elf! and frequently, in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner, put the que&s;tion to me, whether it were not better for him to do &s;o, and go to hell at once, to know the wor&s;t, than to live in his pre&s;ent condi|tion? from which I earne&s;tly di&s;&s;uaded him. He would &s;ome|times bla&s;pheme! cur&s;e God! and wi&s;h he were more power|ful than he! he &s;pent his time in whittling &s;ticks, &amp;c. and would lift up his knife, &s;tab it into the mantle piece, and &s;ay, O! if that wereG&mdash;! I once took him a&s;ide and urged him
<PB N="27" REF="020203_0026_0FAE3C8C414881A8">
much to attempt to pray, with long entreaty I prevailed. He fell upon his knees, uttered a few words, &s;tarted up in horror, and &s;aid, I cannot pray! When the late war began, he inli&s;ted in the troops that went to Canada, Anno 1775. The la&s;t words he uttered to me when I bid him farewell at parting, were, I wi&s;h a bullet may pierce through my heart! and he nearly got his wi&s;h! at the &s;iege of Quebec, when the continental &s;oldiers had erected brea&s;t works of ice again&s;t the wall of Quebec, and the firing began, though he did not belong to the train of artillery, again&s;t the advice of Capt. M&mdash;, a worthy officer who told it to me him&s;elf, he would go to the brea&s;t works, where a cannon ball from the city took his head, and &s;cattered his brains and blood on the ground. This is a &s;pecimen only in this life, of the effects of torment on the human mind. And &s;urely we may &s;ay it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the picture of the above mentioned unhappy man the colouring is not to high: on the contrary it does not come up to the life; there are &s;everal facts which I do not chu&s;e to mention; and the truth of my information can be atte&s;ted by many living witne&s;&s;es. Some will &s;ay, the man was mad or delirious and under &s;ome bodily indi&s;po&s;ition. I believe indeed he was delirious under the in&s;upportable weight of the wrath of God; mad in much the &s;ame manner as the damned in hell are, though in a far inferior degree. He was otherwi&s;e intelligent &s;en&s;ible and made a good regular and obedient &s;oldier.</NOTE>! If it be &s;aid the damned will purify them&s;elves by their own exertions; it may be an&s;wered, this is more than any could do in this life, with all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the means of grace and common operations of the &s;pirit. We are not &s;ufficient of our&s;elves &s;ays Paul to think any thing as of our&s;elve&punc; The changing of the whole frame and contex|ture of our &s;piritual and moral nature, is a greater and more dif|ficult work of power, than the creation of the &s;un, moon and &s;tars. Can any per&s;on force him&s;elf to love what by nature he hates? Can the Ethiopean change his colour, or the Leopard his &s;pots? no more can they that are accu&s;tomed to wickedne&s;s do that which is good. If men in hell can by their own power return to God, they are not &s;o far from him there as here; and on this &s;uppo&s;ition, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for the blood of Chri&s;t, or the mi&s;&s;ion of the &s;pirit to bring them to God. Moreover, the word of God teaches, that at the day of judgment the mediatorial &s;cheme will be fini&s;hed, and the mediatorial
<PB N="28" REF="020203_0027_0FAE3C8CE67A0190">
kingdom delivered up to the Father; that God may be all in all; let us compare here, Matth. 13&mdash;39, and Matth. 24&mdash;14, with 1 Corinth. 15&mdash;24. The harve&s;t is the end of the world; this go&s;pel of the kingdom &s;hall be preached in all the world, for a witne&s;s unto all nations, and then &s;hall the end come. Then cometh the end, when he &s;hall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, that God may be all in all. The kingdom to be delivered up mu&s;t be the mediatorial king|dom; the delivering it up mu&s;t mean his fini&s;hing the &s;cheme of grace; the end, when it &s;hall be fini&s;hed, is the day of judgment; con&s;equently, if any be &s;aved after that, it mu&s;t be by another Saviour than Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by another redemp|tion than his atonement. The unavoidable con&s;equence is, that the damned mu&s;t make an atonement for their &s;ins, by their own &s;ufferings, and on this &s;uppo&s;ition, there was no need for the atonement and &s;atisfaction of Chri&s;t at all. For if after a man has &s;pent his life in &s;in, aggravating his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion all the time, by re&s;i&s;ting the light, and rejecting Chri&s;t and his atonement, he can make &s;atisfaction for all his &s;ins, and for the rejection of Chri&s;t too the greate&s;t of them all; much more might he have made a &s;ufficient atonement, by his own &s;uf|ferings, if Chri&s;t had never come at all. It is clear, if Chri&s;t had never come in the fle&s;h nor &s;uffered, men would never have been guilty of the mo&s;t aggravated &s;in they can commit, viz. the rejecting of this gift of God and trampling on his divine blood, and &s;o would have had infinitely le&s;s to &s;atisfy for, than they now have, who live and die rejecting him; and if by pa&s;&s;|ing &s;ome time in hell, they can &s;atisfy for all this aggravated guilt, much more might they, if they had never contracted this la&s;t and greate&s;t guilt. Thus, if Chri&s;t had never come in the fle&s;h, nor died for &s;inners, not only would the &s;alvation of all men have been very po&s;&s;ible; but the &s;alvation of many, of all the damn'd at lea&s;t, would have been much more ea&s;ily attain|able by their own &s;ufferings, than it can be in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. What nece&s;&s;ity then for the &s;ufferings and death of the Son of God? what advantage by it? or rather is not the di&s;advantage ari&s;ing from it very great, at lea&s;t to many, as only aggravating their guilt and doubling their puni&s;hment. It cannot be &s;aid that the Saviour hath procured this by his &s;atisfaction, that the &s;inners own atonement for all his &s;ins, that of rejecting him among others might become more ea&s;y. It is clear there is no &s;uch idea held forth in the &s;criptures, but
<PB N="29" REF="020203_0028_0FAE3C90DAD44940">
the contrary is declared in the &s;tronge&s;t language, that the re|jection of his atonement will infinitely aggravate the guilt and puni&s;hment of the rejectors; and on this hypothe&s;is the mediatorial &s;cheme will not be fini&s;hed, nor the mediatorial kingdom delivered up at the day of judgment, which we are a&s;&s;ured it will be. Be&s;ides if there be an infinite &s;ufficiency in the atonement of Chri&s;t, and if it be available to &s;alvation whe|ther accepted or rejected, why demand any more at all of the &s;inner? but if it be &s;aid that Chri&s;t atoned for all our &s;ins, ex|cept that of rejecting him, and that we mu&s;t &s;atisfy by our own &s;ufferings for that; then it will follow that our &s;ufferings mu&s;t be equally meritorious as the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, if not more &s;o; for &s;urely there is more guilt, ingratitude, enmity and ba&s;e|ne&s;s, in &s;purning redeeming blood, and trampling on redeem|ing blood, through all our life, than in all our other &s;ins. By other &s;ins men reject the authority of God; but by this they not only reject the authority which commands them to believe in his Son, but al&s;o pour contempt on infinite love and mercy; and the rejection of the &s;aviour prevents their &s;anctification and is at the bottom of all other &s;ins; at mo&s;t a little longer con|tinuance in hell would have done the bu&s;ine&s;s, without the in|carnation and &s;atisfaction of Chri&s;t. How tremenduous is the precipice of error!</P>
<P>The truth is, a gift rejected can avail us nothing, unle&s;s to aggravate our guilt. If Chri&s;t's atonement be finally rejected we can receive no benefit by it; and this is the uniform lan|guage of God's word. He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved: He that believeth not &s;hall be damned. Who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life. But the fearful and the unbelieving, and all liars, &s;hall have their portion in the lake which burns with fire and brim&s;tone. Which Chri&s;t explains thus, depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. But the doctrine we oppo&s;e gives the lie to all this and repeats the old temptation, ye &s;hall not &s;urely die. In fine, on this ab&s;urd &s;cheme of principles, we may a&s;k, what meaning in the peculiar doctrines of the go&s;pel? It &s;eems to unhinge the whole. What &s;en&s;e in the doctrine of election? what in the doctrine of regeneration? Except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate; for many I &s;ay unto you &s;hall &s;eek to enter and &s;hall not be able. What meaning in the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith in Chri&s;t? Why does our Lord &s;ay, except ye repent ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h. What
<PB N="30" REF="020203_0029_0FAE3C91D27E1D98">
&s;en&s;e in the doctrine of the &s;in unto death, or the unpardon|able &s;in? What in the&s;e texts, Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead who die in the Lord. If ye believe not that I am he ye &s;hall die in your &s;ins. The prophet Daniel &s;tates the &s;eperation between the righteous and the wicked, Dan. 12&mdash;2, And many of them that &s;leep in the du&s;t, &s;hall awake, &s;ome to everla&s;ting life, and &s;ome to &s;hame and everla&s;ting contempt. The Prince of prophets confirms his &s;ervant's declaration, Matth. 25&mdash;31&mdash;46. When the Son of man &s;hall come in his glory, then &s;hall he &s;it on the throne of his glory, and before him &s;hall be gathered all nations; and he &s;hall &s;eparate them one from another, as a &s;hepherd divideth the &s;heep from the goats; and he &s;hall &s;et the &s;heep on his right hand and the goats on his left; and he &s;hall &s;ay unto them on his right hand: come ye ble&s;&s;ed, &amp;c. and to them on the left, depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, &amp;c. the &s;olemn &s;eene clo&s;es with the&s;e words: and the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment; but the righteous into life eternal. Here is a final &s;eparation made; do we ever hear of their coming together again? Here are two parallel lines, and both drawn out into eternity by Jehovah him&s;elf. Is it po&s;&s;ible they can ever meet? mathematicians tell us of lines which may eternally approximate and yet never meet; but the&s;e modern divines tell us of a greater paradox; two lines which never approximate and yet &s;hall meet.</P>
<P>Much more might be &s;aid in oppo&s;ition to this dangerous doctrine, but as others have oppo&s;ed it with much good &s;en&s;e and &s;trength of rea&s;oning; I have thought proper to con|tribute only this mite. I am per&s;uaded the authors are on ground infinitely dangerous, and they have much need to pau&s;e and con&s;ider; lea&s;t while they pretend to exalt the divine mer|cy; they be found attempting to fully Jehovah's character; o|verturn his throne; &s;ubvert his moral government; &s;tain his holine&s;s and di&s;honour his ju&s;tice. Do not they make the God of truth a liar? the oath of God a nullity? for he has &s;worn in his wrath that unbelievers &s;hall never enter into his re&s;t. The God of infinite purity a tolerator of &s;in? the God of order the author of confu&s;ion? Nay the &s;cheme tends to the annihila|tion of all moral rectitude in God, angels and men. And as it is infinitely &s;oothing and flattering to the lu&s;ts and corruptions of men; no que&s;tion, but its promoters will meet with &s;ucce&s;s. Dei&s;tical principles prevail much already; and this doctrine is calculated to give them greater force and a wider range. For men of &s;uch principles will naturally a&s;k, can the&s;e preachers believe the bible, when they &s;o earne&s;tly propagate what has
<PB N="31" REF="020203_0030_0FAE3C9230608580">
&s;o little countenance from it? yea is &s;o oppo&s;ite to it. In fine, the doctrine has had its ri&s;e, it will run its cour&s;e, and mu&s;t have its fall, and none who wi&s;h the pro&s;perity of the church, need be over much concerned. Here&s;ies mu&s;t needs come, that tho&s;e who are approved may be made manife&s;t. None of Chri&s;t's &s;heep can be lo&s;t. The church is built on a rock, and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.</P>
<P>There is one manife&s;t defect in the new &s;cheme. Its au|thors are very &s;ilent about the eternal fate of the fallen angels. They &s;ay nothing at all about them. But it is evident, that on their principles of benevolence in the deity, and the inju&s;tice of eternal puni&s;hment; it would be equally incon&s;i&s;tent to damn them to eternal &s;ufferings: as the wicked among men: yea, more &s;o; as they have never been guilty of rejecting a Saviour offered to them. And if men can atone for all <HI>their</HI> aggravated guilt by their own &s;ufferings, much more may the devils for <HI>theirs.</HI></P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of moral evil under the government of an infi|nitely good God is a my&s;tery; that it does exi&s;t is unque&s;tiona|ble. But how it came to exi&s;t is a dark que&s;tion; doubtle&s;s it is the con&s;equence of free agency in rational creatures; and mu&s;t originate in an abu&s;e of their liberty. But it is manife&s;t that God dwells and reigns in the mid&s;t of this thick darkne&s;s; he &s;u&s;tains the maje&s;ty of his government, notwith&s;tanding the tendency of &s;in to drive it to ruin; this he does by inflicting the penalty of his law on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. It is certain that in the eternal &s;tate, holy angels and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made per|fect, will &s;till be rational, free and moral agents. They will indeed be unchangeably fixed in a &s;tate of perfect holine&s;s; but in &s;uch a manner, as will be con&s;i&s;tent with freedom. They will not be fixed as in a fro&s;t. They will be eternally free a|gents. But a free agent mu&s;t be governed by motives; which pre&s;ent him a free choice. The eternal puni&s;hments of devils and wicked men may therefore touch &s;ome wheel and produce &s;ome effect in the divine government, of which we are not aware. They may tend to give eternal energy to the divine admini&s;tration. The glorified may be kept immutably in a ho|ly &s;tate, by clear views of the glory of the divine nature; the beauty of holine&s;s; the inflexibility of divine ju&s;tice di&s;played in the eternal puni&s;hment of &s;in. But indeed this &s;ubject is too far from our reach. In all this argument, I have &s;aid little about the infinite evil of &s;in. It is not ea&s;y to fix the
<PB N="32" REF="020203_0031_0FAE3C92EC32D990">
idea of any thing infinite in the finite mind of man, and there|fore rea&s;oning deduced from it, does not &s;trike with &s;uch con|viction. It is certain however, that &s;everal things afford ground to form this idea of it. It is &s;aid, Job 22&mdash;5, Is not thy wick|edne&s;s great and thine iniquities infinite? Sin is the rejection of an infinite good, God him&s;elf. It is rebellion again&s;t an in|finite &s;overeign; and were it as powerful as it is &s;inful, it would ca&s;t down his throne and annihilate his being and per|fections; for as the &s;inner will not regard the authority of the lawgiver, we are &s;ure he would not &s;uffer the penalty, if he could re&s;i&s;t, the con&s;equence is, an end would be put to the divine government. And God mu&s;t hate &s;in with an infinite hatred, and mu&s;t manife&s;t this hatred in an infinite manner; and ac|cordingly in the room of all the redeemed, an infinite &s;urety was appointed, and an infinite atonement exacted. By which atonement, all who accept it, are &s;aved with an infinite &s;al|vation; and therefore rea&s;on would &s;ay, tho&s;e who reject it, mu&s;t peri&s;h with an infinite or everla&s;ting de&s;truction; but on this I do not in&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the whole, with a &s;hort addre&s;s to tho&s;e who have embraced the univer&s;al &s;cheme. I have no hopes of making any impre&s;&s;ions on the teachers of it. Their pride, their honour, their fame, their intere&s;t, which are powerful &s;prings of action in the human heart, are all combined again&s;t me; and will probably not cea&s;e to operate, until they have fini&s;hed the &s;cene. But po&s;&s;ibly &s;omething may be done with their followers.</P>
<P>My poor deluded brethren; it behoves you to con&s;ider well the ground on which you &s;tand. It is a matter of infinite im|portance to your own &s;ouls, and the &s;ouls of others: to your own &s;ouls; how dreadful to go down to the grave with a lie in your right hand! how terrible to meet God at the judg|ment &s;eat in a &s;tate of war again&s;t the truths of his word, a|gain&s;t his &s;overeignty, his government, his ju&s;tice, mercy, good|ne&s;s truth and holine&s;s! his law and go&s;pel both! will you ven|ture to appear at his awful bar, and call him a liar to his face!

It was a &s;aying of Luther, the eminent German Reformer, to who&s;e exertions in the cau&s;e of God the whole world is indebted; that &s;atan will never be at re&s;t for the good word's &s;ake. For a long time, he en|deavoured to de&s;troy the church by per&s;ecution; but was fru&s;|trated in his attempt, for the blood of the &s;aints was the &s;eed of the church. Now &s;ince the rights of mankind have been better under&s;tood, and per&s;ecution has in a great mea&s;ure cea&s;ed throughout the nations; he endeavours to work the ruin of Chri&s;t's kingdom by odious and mon&s;truous errors.

<P>Its purport is plainly this, let men live as they plea&s;e, with|out any regard to the divine law or go&s;pel; they mu&s;t be &s;aved: otherwi&s;e God would be cruel and unju&s;t. That is, creatures mu&s;t be totally independent of their creator.

<HEAD>The connexion &s;tated between Civil Government and religion.</HEAD>
<P>CIVIL magi&s;tracy is unque&s;tionably an ordinance of God. And it is al&s;o called an ordinance of man; becau&s;e though God has in&s;tituted government and order among men: yet he hath left the particular form altogether free to the choice of nations. The in&s;titution, without doubt, proceeds from God as the creator and moral governor of the world. Dominion is not founded on grace. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is indeed given to be head over all things for the good of his body the church; and all power is given to him in heaven and earth. But this will not infer, that magi&s;tracy is an ordinance of Chri&s;t as media|tor; or that it proceeds from him in that character; no more than the &s;ubordination of angels to him as his mini&s;ters; and the &s;ubjection of the elements to his power, will infer, that the&s;e were created by him as mediator. Magi&s;tracy has its foundation not in the grace of the go&s;pel; but in the law and light of nature. Its end is not the eternal &s;alvation of men, but the pre&s;ervation of order among them in this world. Its rewards and puni&s;hments do not extend to the life to come, but are confined to this. Neverthele&s;s we believe, that being an or|dinance of God, it mu&s;t bear a relation to him, and ought to be applied to his glory. And civil government being moral go|vernment, it mu&s;t have its foundation in moral &s;entiments; which moral &s;entiments con&s;titute natural religion: and as the chri&s;tian religion contains all the principles of natural religion and makes many valuable additions to them; though we cannot affirm, that the knowledge of what is peculiar to it, is nece&s;|&s;ary to the being of civil government, yet it conduces much to its well-being. Civil communities and their rulers, will there|fore find, that to cultivate moral &s;entiments, or promote the practice of virtue, which is founded on the knowledge and fear of God, is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of go|vernment among them. And communities made up altogether, or chiefly, of Chri&s;tians will find, that the encouragement and promotion of the chri&s;tian religion, by the body of the people and their rulers, as far as is competent to them even in their civil capacities, will infinitely conduce to their intere&s;t and advantage in this life, or to the purpo&s;es of peace, order and good government among them.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="020203_0036_0FAE3C9B77582AC8">It is natural for erring mortals to run into extremes. While &s;ome of our worthy ance&s;tors gave perhaps too much power to the civil magi&s;trate about religion; &s;ome in our days, to &s;hun that extreme, &s;eem to have run into the oppo&s;ite. They teach, that the magi&s;trate as &s;uch, has nothing to do with it, and there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that, what many among us under&s;tand by liberty of con&s;cience in religion, is a liberty, ut|terly to di&s;regard all religion and ca&s;t off all con&s;cience. This too plainly appears from the practice of many, from the neglect of religion in our civil con&s;titutions and laws; and the inattention of magi&s;trates to put in force the inadequate and feeble laws which have been enacted again&s;t irreligion, profanity and vice. But &s;urely there mu&s;t be a wide difference between the&s;e two. Liberty of con&s;cience &s;uppo&s;es con&s;cience to exi&s;t, con&s;cience of duty both towards God and man. But without a &s;en&s;e of religion and moral excellence, it cannot exi&s;t; without the knowledge of the&s;e, we &s;hould be as void of con|&s;cience as the inhabitants of the fore&s;t. To grant liberty of con|&s;cience then is one thing, and to pur&s;ue &s;uch a line of conduct, as tends to annihilate all con&s;cience, is &s;omething very dif|ferent.</P>
<P>In order to a clear di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this important &s;ubject, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain the term religion, and then &s;tate the que&s;tion with preci&s;ion. By religion in this que&s;tion, we mean, a belief of the exi&s;tence of God, &s;ome competent de|gree of knowledge of his nature and perfections; of our en|tire dependence on him; that we mu&s;t be accountable to him for our conduct; a belief of his providence; and that he is the avenger of the wicked and rewarder of the good; that he is e&s;&s;entially holy, ju&s;t and good; that if the wicked e&s;cape the judgment of man, they cannot e&s;cape the judgment of God; or if they &s;hould e&s;cape his righteous judgment in this life, they will not in the life to come. But a &s;ecret belief of the&s;e things will not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, it mu&s;t be vi&s;ible to &s;o|ciety in &s;ome way or other. Therefore there mu&s;t be in re|ligion a vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ion of this belief, a confe&s;&s;ion of the name of God, a reverence and fear of his divine maje&s;ty, and all this expre&s;&s;ed in wor&s;hipping him, in that form which is mo&s;t agreeable to the wor&s;hipper's con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion then is not, whether the magi&s;trate ought to a&s;&s;ume the power of managing the internal government of the
<PB N="38" REF="020203_0037_0FAE3C9C75189720">
church of Chri&s;t? or meddle with the internal order of any religious &s;ociety? This all men will readily grant would be improper. Nor, 2dly is it, whether full liberty as to modes and forms of wor&s;hip, or even principles of doctrine which do not &s;ap the foundation of good order in civil &s;ociety ought to be allowed? this is readily granted. Nor, 3dly is it, whe|ther the magi&s;trate may act in this bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>ex arbitrio,</HI> or by his mere will and plea&s;ure without the con&s;ent of the &s;ubjects or a majority of them, forcing on them by his &s;ole authority, reli|gion and the modes of it? It is certain the civil magi&s;trate has no legal power to do &s;o; and it is equally true, that in this &s;en&s;e, he has no legal power to do any thing. His authority is delegated. He is the &s;ervant of the public. His authority is derived from the grant, con&s;ent, or previous compact of the people. But the que&s;tion is, what may the community at large do? what &s;tipulations and conditions may they lawfully fix on in their compact with each other and their magi&s;trates? may they neglect religion altogether? or may they not provide for the &s;ecurity and practice thereof? and if they may, is it not the duty of their magi&s;trates in the admini&s;tration of govern|ment to &s;ee the&s;e &s;tipulations and conditions fulfilled, or in other words to &s;ee the laws in favour of religion and virtue executed? we affirm they may and ought &s;o to do; and to maintain the con|trary, is to found civil government, not indeed on heatheni&s;m, the foundation is not &s;o good as that; but on ab&s;olute athei&s;m. It would place it intirely independent of God.</P>
<P>The very nature of the civil compact &s;hews religion in the &s;en&s;e above defined to be nece&s;&s;ary to its formation; for with|out it men can place no confidence in each other; without it there can be no faith among them. This compact is a &s;acred covenant between the members of the community and between the whole community and their magi&s;trates, in which they &s;o|lemnly engage to be faithful to each other, to &s;ubmit to whole|&s;ome laws agreed on by the whole, and &s;upport their magi&s;|trates in the execution of the&s;e laws; while their rulers with equal &s;olemnity engage to execute them: and though the co|venant be chiefly about &s;ecular or temporal intere&s;ts; yet a &s;en&s;e of the obligation to fulfill it mu&s;t ari&s;e from religion. In &s;uch a covenant God is called to witne&s;s their &s;incerity, either explicitly or implicitly; and to be the avenger of &s;uch as per|fidiou&s;ly break it. No doubt the &s;tate engages to puni&s;h the violation of the compact; but whence ari&s;es the obligation on
<PB N="39" REF="020203_0038_0FAE3C9CAF5314F0">
them to do &s;o? and what ground of confidence in them that they will do &s;o? &s;urely a &s;en&s;e of the authority of God obliging them, is the origin of this. If it be &s;aid, that a &s;en&s;e of com|mon danger will oblige them. We an&s;wer a &s;en&s;e of common danger will make a herd of &s;wine &s;tand in defence of each other. But men are &s;uperior in nature to &s;wine, and mu&s;t be governed by higher motives; be&s;ides, previou&s;ly to the &s;o|cial compact, the members might have kept them&s;elves free, or in a &s;tate of nature; and after it is formed they may re|turn to that &s;tate, on occa&s;ion of every little difficulty, or ima|gined &s;everity; unle&s;s they have &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the obligation of their plighted faith in the compact, which &s;en&s;e mu&s;t origin|ate in the knowledge and fear of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. I argue the point from the nature of man. Man is a rational, a free and moral agent. There is a kind of &s;ociety among many of the brutal tribes. Herds of &s;heep and oxen run into &s;ociety, his they do merely by a blind in&s;tinct. God &s;ees meet to govern and rule them in that manner and it is a|greeable to their nature; but man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a higher na|ture. He is a rational and voluntary agent. A &s;ociety of men then ought not to be formed on the &s;ame principles as a &s;ociety of brutes, not from a principle of blind in&s;tinct, nor merely from a &s;en&s;e of common danger, but from a perception of the authority of God, a di&s;cernment of the divine in&s;titution, and a regard to the honour and glory of God and the good of mankind. A rational and moral agent mu&s;t be actuated by motives, and the&s;e motives mu&s;t be rational or adapted to the dignity of his nature: and to move him to form &s;ociety and per|form the duties of the &s;ocial union; no motives are truly &s;o; but tho&s;e above mentioned; all which nece&s;&s;arily involves the knowledge fear and wor&s;hip of God. Some moral philo&s;o|phers have called man a religious animal, and tell us this is his principal di&s;tinction from the brutal tribes and chief &s;uperiority above them. Mu&s;t they not then proceed ignorantly and erro|neou&s;ly, who would propo&s;e to form or pre&s;erve a &s;ociety of the&s;e creatures, without any regard to religion. Suppo&s;ing a number of men, accidentally meeting on an uninhabited i&s;land, and about to form them&s;elves into a body politic; they nece&s;&s;arily behoved to fix on &s;ome religious and moral principles, as the ba&s;is of the &s;ocial union among them; for without this, as has been &s;aid in the former argument, there could be no faith among them, no tru&s;t or confidence in each other. If religious and moral prin|ciples
<PB N="40" REF="020203_0039_0FAE3C9D70084F78">
be nece&s;&s;ary to the formation of &s;ociety, they are equally nece&s;&s;ary to its pre&s;ervation, and without a &s;teady regard to them no &s;ociety can &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. The affirmative of the que&s;tion may be argued from the nature of civil government. Civil government is certainly mo|ral government, and by it God carries on his moral govern|ment of the world. The rule of this government is the moral law or the law of God; for let men diver&s;ify their laws as they plea&s;e, they mu&s;t coincide with the divine law. They cannot contradict it without contradicting the eternal and im|mutable principles of equity and ju&s;tice. The variety of laws among men calculated for the good of &s;ociety (and they have no moral power to make any other) is no more than the appli|cation of the divine law to the infinite variety of circum&s;tances in &s;ociety. The authority which obliges to obedience, does not originate only in the con&s;ent or compact of &s;ociety, but in a &s;ource infinitely higher, the will of the &s;upreme governor. God who created man a rational and moral agent, under the obligation of his laws, al&s;o formed him a &s;ocial being. He made him with a &s;trong propen&s;ity to &s;ociety, and mutual wants and nece&s;&s;ities &s;trenghten this principle, and urge men into &s;ociety. One of the &s;tronge&s;t propen&s;ities in human nature, the inclination of the two &s;exes to each other, is the fir&s;t attracting power, and lays the foundation of the &s;ocial union. But men are bound to yield to this propen&s;ity, not by blind in&s;tinct as the brutes; but by a moral obligation, the authority of God: and to perform the duties re&s;ulting from that relation, and in|deed all the other duties of the &s;ocial union, by the &s;ame au|thority. He who gave laws to men as individuals, al&s;o gave laws to &s;ocieties of men. And indeed it is only in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, that the chief part of the divine law can have practi|cally any place, or that there can be any &s;cope for the perform|ance of what it requires.</P>
<P N="4">4. We argue the point from the character given to civil rulers. They are not mere creatures of the &s;tate, but mini&s;ters of God for good, as the apo&s;tle calls them. Civil rulers are improperly &s;tiled legi&s;lators or lawgivers. The &s;upreme God is the law-giver to men. And they are but mini&s;ters of his law: and mu&s;t be accountable to him for their conduct; he is king of kings and Lord of Lords. Daniel &s;ays to Bel&s;hazzar, the God in who&s;e hand is thy breath, and who&s;e are all thy ways, that is, to whom thou mu&s;t be accountable for them all, ha&s;t thou
<PB N="41" REF="020203_0040_0FAE3C9E31BD3EF0">
not glorified. He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God. None can deny, that all the duties of the civil or &s;ocial union are moral duties, which affect the con&s;ci|ence and oblige it. But who has a right to rule the con&s;ci|ence? not any civil &s;tate, but God only. Who is the Lord of con&s;cience not the &s;tate but God. If the laws of a &s;tate &s;hould in any in&s;tance contradict the laws of God they have no moral obligation; no man is bound to obey for con&s;cience &s;ake. But it is an un&s;peakable mercy, that the precepts of moral duty be|tween man and man, are generally &s;o clear, and every man has got &s;uch a legible copy of them on his heart; that &s;tates in a general way will not, if hone&s;tly aiming at truth and equity, go far wrong in the application of them. At any rate if civil rulers pretend to rule rational and con&s;cientious beings, if they would act in a higher character, than herdmen ruling over &s;o many cattle. All that they can in rea&s;on pretend to; is to ad|mini&s;ter and apply the divine law; and act as mini&s;ters under God the &s;upreme Lord of con&s;cience. And to place civil go|vernment independent of God and religion; is either to dive&s;t men of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, and &s;o make them brutes: or it is to make the &s;tate, or magi&s;trate of the &s;tate, the Lord of con|&s;cience; and the law of the &s;tate the only rule of con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="5">5. We argue it from the nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;e of oaths in civil &s;ociety. It is manife&s;t that when men enter into compact with and &s;wear to be faithful to each other. It is by the name of God they &s;wear. Thus princes bind them&s;elves to their &s;ub|jects and &s;ubjects to their princes. We cannot have a marriage; nor a governor; a barri&s;ter; a juryman; nor a witne&s;s in a court; without a &s;olemn appeal to the deity. An oath is for confirmation and puts an end to all &s;trife. It is ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that this is only an artificial mode of forming and &s;u&s;taining &s;o|ciety invented by men; and that the only object of terror is the puni&s;hment appointed by the &s;tate to the crime of perjury; for on that &s;uppo&s;ition, it would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e as well, to &s;wear the witne&s;&s;es by the judge's little finger; only take care to puni&s;h perjury when detected. Poor blind mortals that we are&punc; We depend on God in every &s;en&s;e and do not &s;ee it in any. His &s;acred and adorable name has been in all ages, and ever well be the grand pillar to &s;upport civil &s;ociety. But unle&s;s religion or the knowledge, fear and wor&s;hip of God be promot|ed among the citizens, it is ab&s;urd to &s;wear them by his name. The fear of God will be a more powerful re&s;traint from crimes
<PB N="42" REF="020203_0041_0FAE3C9F231D9FC0">
than all the terrors of gaols and gibbets; and without &s;ome de|gree of a religious fear of the deity, in vain &s;hould we hold out to men the&s;e terrors; it merits our attention here, that this &s;olemn appeal to the deity in an oath is univer&s;al and perpetual as human nature it&s;elf; which is no ob&s;cure hint that our argument is founded on the common &s;en&s;e of mankind.</P>
<P N="6">6. If the magi&s;trate as &s;uch have no concern with religion, then it follows that the &s;ubjects or citizens as &s;uch have as little. And thus in idea at lea&s;t, we have a &s;ociety of rational and mo|ral agents, more dangerous than the mo&s;t furious bea&s;ts of prey. Their rea&s;on without the controul of religion only makes them capable of greater mi&s;chief. And on this plan, we &s;ee a moral relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among moral agents, without any regard to a moral law, or to God the giver of that law: This is athei&s;m and ab&s;urdity with a witne&s;s. And we may venture to affirm that no &s;ociety of men ever could be formed on the&s;e principles: or if formed, it could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t for one day. But let men in their &s;peculations err as they plea&s;e, God hath fixed boundaries to human nature over which it cannot pa&s;s. And we may a&s;&s;ert there never was and never will be a &s;ociety of men alto|gether in &s;uch a &s;tate; though by erroneous views of the &s;ub|ject and men's inattention to religion in civil &s;ociety; great damage may be done, and we may be reduced to the lowe&s;t or nearly the lowe&s;t degree of con&s;i&s;tency and order in the &s;ocial &s;tate. In a word religion and virtue form the very ba&s;is of good government. The knowledge, fear and wor&s;hip of God are nece&s;&s;ary to the very being and con&s;ervation of civil &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P N="7">7. This truth may be argued from the very de&s;ign of civil government, which is to prevent or puni&s;h the&s;e mal-practices, that tend to overthrow the order; &s;ubvert the &s;tability and peace; and &s;o work the di&s;&s;olution of civil &s;ociety. That this is the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution and erection of civil government, is &s;elf evident. But the difficulty is to inve&s;tigate and a&s;certain the true extent of the power which ought to be ve&s;ted in civil rulers for this purpo&s;e. The propo&s;ition divides it&s;elf into two branches, the fir&s;t is to prevent, the &s;econd is to puni&s;h crimes. It is much &s;afer and wi&s;er to prevent crimes, if po&s;&s;ible, than to puni&s;h them. Puni&s;hments e&s;pecially by death mu&s;t be always di&s;agreeable to humane rulers; and though &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;a|ry, ought never to be executed with a vindictive &s;pirit, but only in terrorem; or to prevent a repetition of the crime by
<PB N="43" REF="020203_0042_0FAE3C9FA9DB1E50">
the offender him&s;elf or by others. And thus the la&s;t branch of the office of rulers namely puni&s;hing, finally reverts into the fir&s;t; which &s;erves to &s;hew in the cleare&s;t manner that to prevent crimes, is the grand de&s;ign of civil government. The work of puni&s;hing is the la&s;t, mo&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sful and di&s;agreeable expedi|ent. If no previous pains be taken for this purpo&s;e; but the whole re&s;ted on puni&s;hments; the work will grow on the hands of rulers. The more they puni&s;h the more they will find to do; until the &s;tate like a rotten hou&s;e, fall on its ma&s;ters and cru&s;h them in its ruins. Tho&s;e then who think that the &s;ole de&s;ign of civil government, is to puni&s;h, goad and compell men like bea&s;ts of burden, are greatly mi&s;taken. The chief de&s;ign of the in&s;titution, is to form the manners of the people to virtue and every &s;pecies of moral goodne&s;s. They who rigorou&s;ly puni&s;h, but take no previous pains to prevent crimes; may be aptly compared to tho&s;e har&s;h and tyrannical pedagogues, who u&s;e no diligence to lead their pupils on to knowledge; but &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;e them when found deficient, or not &s;o wi&s;e as they ought to be.</P>
<P>But by what means &s;hall crimes be prevented? the que&s;tion is truly important. In order to it, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen the internal bonds of the &s;ocial union; or in other words the &s;prings of virtue and true goodne&s;s. All the&s;e may be &s;ummed up in two. At lea&s;t I know not any but will fall under the one or the other. Whatever external bonds may be devi&s;ed and framed by men to hold &s;ociety together; the internal are &s;ocial love and con&s;cience. With the&s;e men are fitted by the all-wi&s;e creator, both to form and con&s;erve human &s;ociety. Take one or both away, and there can be no more coherence a|mong mankind, than among &s;cattered atoms driven with a fu|rious wind. We &s;hall con&s;ider them in order, and fir&s;t for &s;o|cial love. By what means &s;hall it be diffu&s;ed through the bo|dy of the people? there is but one way to do this, and that is to promote the knowledge, fear and wor&s;hip of God. God mu&s;t be made known to them, as the common parent, friend and benefactor of all men; as the author of all our ble&s;&s;ings, which he pours out with a profu&s;e and liberal hand. They mu&s;t hence learn to view their fellow creatures as children of the &s;ame family; under the care of the &s;ame indulgent father, and ac|countable to the &s;ame righteous judge. That per&s;onal intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ts in promoting that of the public; that the happine&s;s of each individual is comprehended in the good of the whole. In
<PB N="44" REF="020203_0043_0FAE3CA48736F450">
a word, that true &s;elf-love and &s;ocial are the &s;ame. The Chri&s;|tian religion is admirably calculated to &s;trengthen benevolence and promote brotherly love. The doctrine that God &s;o loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever be|lieveth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, &amp;c. That the Son voluntarily laid down his life to redeem us to God, and the commandment of this beloved Saviour, that men love one another, enforced with this cogent argument, his infinite love to them, if properly repre&s;ented and urged, might produce glorious con&s;equences. This divine benevolence, if deeply rooted in the heart, would lead &s;pontaneou&s;ly to all the duties, which we owe to our neigh|bour. A &s;acred authority a&s;&s;ures us that love is the fulfilling of the law, and can work nothing but good to our neighbour, and we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the laws of every &s;tate to be calculated for the good of mankind, and how&s;oever diver&s;ified, if founded on the immutable principles of virtue, mu&s;t be corre&s;pondent to and coincident with the divine law; and therefore this divine principle would lead to the ob&s;ervation of the laws of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;econd bond of the &s;ocial union, which civil rulers ought carefully to &s;trengthen in order to prevent crimes, is con|&s;cience. Con&s;cience is ju&s;t the voice of God in the &s;oul; and may be defined, a man's own judgment on his intentions and actions; in con&s;equence of examining them by the divine law, acquitting or condemning him&s;elf as the&s;e agree or di&s;agree with &s;aid law. This is a powerful bond of &s;ociety. Were it not for this there would be no government among men at all. God in mercy to men has implanted more or le&s;s of it in every brea&s;t. And God alone is the Lord of con&s;cience and not any civil &s;tate; con&s;equently the divine law is the rule of con&s;cience; and the laws of the &s;tate only in &s;o far as they are agreeable to it. It is evident that the moral &s;en&s;e or con&s;cience will admit of various degrees. Indeed, through ignorance of God and his law, and a habitual cour&s;e of wickedne&s;s, men may lo&s;e much if not every degree of it.</P>
<P>A perception of good and evil, of moral beauty and deform|ity; of prai&s;e and blame may be almo&s;t totally eradicated from their minds. A &s;acred authority a&s;&s;ures us, that &s;ome men have their con&s;ciences feared as with a hot iron, and are pa&s;t feel|ing: yea may arrive at that dreadful &s;tate as to glory in their &s;hame, and be a&s;hamed of their glory; and thou&s;ands in our country are advanced &s;o far already. It is incumbent then on civil rulers, to u&s;e every mean in their power, to give vigour
<PB N="45" REF="020203_0044_0FAE3CA5B72AF878">
and ela&s;ticity to con&s;cience. This can be done only by pro|moting the knowledge of the divine law, the rule of con&s;cience, and of Jehovah the Lord of con&s;cience; which brings us exact|ly on the &s;ame ground, where the former point placed us; and &s;hews in the cleare&s;t manner, that all good government is certainly founded on the knowledge, fear and wor&s;hip of God; the knowledge of his law, his &s;acred authority, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But another que&s;tion occurs here, how &s;hall civil rulers pro|mote the knowledge, fear and wor&s;hip of God? Their own example is a great deal. Let them &s;eek after the knowledge of God and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Saviour; let them fear and reverence his holy name; let them practi&s;e his wor&s;hip both public and private, and particularly be careful to &s;anctify the holy &s;abbath. The ob&s;ervation of a &s;abbath for religious ex|erci&s;es, or &s;etting apart, a portion of our time for acquiring the knowledge of God and wor&s;hipping him, is a plain dictate of the law of nature. The heathen nations all practi&s;ed it, though ir|regularly and devoted much more of their time to religious exerci&s;es &s;uch as they were, than God requires of us, which is only the &s;eventh part; and without a &s;abbath, the know|ledge, fear and wor&s;hip of God would inevitably peri&s;h from among men. Irreligious rulers may pretend to be friends to their country; but they are the very plagues of it: while by the exerci&s;e of power they think to build up the &s;ocial fabric: by their practice they &s;ap its deepe&s;t foundations. Like fool|i&s;h phy&s;icians, while they pretend to heal wounds, cure di&s;|tempers incident to the body, and without pity lop off mem|bers; they corrupt and poi&s;on the juices, and tear a&s;under the ligaments and joints. We have &s;hewed already, that the grand de&s;ign of civil government is not merely to puni&s;h crimes when committed, but to prevent them by forming the manners of the people to virtue and goodne&s;s. But how will this work in the hands of profane rulers? Men in exalted &s;tations mu&s;t have an amazing influence on the lower cla&s;&s;es; if the pattern they &s;et be good, they may do much good; if bad, much, very much evil. Blind and infatuated men! who think they can uphold &s;ociety by their own &s;hort-&s;ighted policy and har&s;h power, while by example they are undermining its foundations. The laws of the &s;tate &s;entence poor wretches to the gibbet; but perhaps in very many in&s;tances it will be found that &s;ome of the men who enacted the laws, or execute them, may have been the occa&s;ion, by their infidelity in principle and profanity in prac|tice, of bringing them there.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="020203_0045_0FAE3CA67A37F9F8">It is a work highly worthy of virtuous rulers, and will co|operate with their good example to gain the end propo&s;ed, by proper laws to fix and encourage a &s;ufficient number of &s;choole, and other &s;eminaries of learning, throughout the country; and particular attention &s;hould be paid to the character of the teachers, and provi&s;ion made that the pupils be taught not on|ly the arts and &s;ciences, but the principles of religion and vir|tue. But above all, they &s;hould encourage the &s;preading of the go&s;pel of peace. There is no nece&s;&s;ity for, no propriety in granting a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment to any one denomination of Chri&s;tians, even the pure&s;t. But without this, laws might be framed, that would greatly tend to &s;pread the go&s;pel and with it true and undefiled religion. Whatever men may think, who do not allow them&s;elves to think deeply or frequently on this &s;ub|ject; the go&s;pel is the great river of life, which, if it had free cour&s;e through the nations, would certainly in a high degree purify them; it is the tree of life, which bears twelve manner of fruits, and bears them every month, and the leaves thereof are for the healing of the nations. What a pity to &s;it on the banks of this river and refu&s;e its waters! to &s;it under the &s;hadow of this tree and reject its fruits! Finally they &s;hould let all men know, that they ought to profe&s;s; and it is expected of them, that they will profe&s;s; yea and mu&s;t profe&s;s &s;ome re|ligion. That we look on a man who profe&s;&s;es no religion, as a wild bea&s;t; as the wor&s;t of all wild bea&s;ts; that his rea&s;on only makes him capable of greater mi&s;chief than his brethren in the de&s;ert. That we are &s;ure, he is not bound in con&s;cience, to di&s;own and deny God; bla&s;pheme his name; profane his &s;abbath, &amp;c. That he might with equal rea&s;on pretend he is bound in con&s;cience to commit robbery, theft, burglary. There is nothing more natural to the human mind than religion in &s;ome form or other; and yet there is nothing to which the heart of man is &s;o much oppo&s;ed as to the true religion; and it is no doubt a collateral proof of Chri&s;tianity being truly of God; that no wicked man can love it in its native &s;implicity. But this is con&s;i&s;tent enough with our fir&s;t po&s;ition, that re|ligion of &s;ome kind or other is natural to the human heart. He then mu&s;t act a mo&s;t unnatural part who profe&s;&s;es no re|ligion in any form. All nations wor&s;hip &s;ome deity; and all men in the day of calamity and death will &s;eek to their God. It is adver&s;ity, and e&s;pecially death approaching, that gives the heart a free vibration. Pro&s;perity debauches it, incarcerates it, deceives it. It is only in pro&s;perity, that men can think
<PB N="47" REF="020203_0046_0FAE3CA726CBB3A0">
and act as if they were independent of God. But alas! it is only when enjoying &s;ome degree of pro&s;perity, health at lea&s;t; that they are capable of any &s;ocial duties; and thus &s;ociety gets their &s;ervice, only when dive&s;ted in &s;ome degree of cool recol|lection. When we &s;ee men utterly di&s;regarding God and pour|ing contempt on his infinite maje&s;ty; it is natural to a&s;k: can that man who makes no con&s;cience of his duty to his maker, make any of his duty to his neighbour? will he not injure me if he can with a pro&s;pect of advantage, and hopes of impunity? when we hear a man wantonly profaning the name of God. We a&s;k, how can any court admit his oath in evidence? will he in that ca&s;e venerate the name of God which he daily treats with the mo&s;t wanton contempt, and perhaps only to give vent to his cruel diabolical pa&s;&s;ions. And &s;uppo&s;ing him to be &s;worn on the Holy Evangeli&s;ts, as the phra&s;e is, what dignity in the bible, or any part of it; but what is derived from God its author? and what propriety in &s;wearing a man by or on the go&s;pels, who can pa&s;s his &s;cornful and profane je&s;ts on them, as freely as bla&s;pheme their author? In a word it is ab|&s;urd to &s;wear by the true God a man who does not know, fear, reverence and wor&s;hip him. It is ab&s;urd to &s;wear a per&s;on on, or by the Evangeli&s;ts, who does not believe them, and who openly manife&s;ts that he does not. Thus irreligious men, like Samp&s;on, gra&s;p the pillars of the temple and pull them down to their own ruin and that of thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>But to proceed, if the internal bonds of the &s;ocial union were once properly &s;trengthened; there would be little occa&s;ion for puni&s;hments. Crimes would be but comparatively few; &s;uch as are of an atrocious nature fewer. Rulers would have little to do but to enjoy the honours of their office. And all this felicity can &s;pring from no other &s;ource, but true religion and virtue. We have in the above argument &s;uppo&s;ed, that if our civil rulers do any-thing effectually for the advancement of religion; it mu&s;t be the chri&s;tian religion: Becau&s;e we are a nation of profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians. And it is certain, no religi|on like it to gain the&s;e grand purpo&s;es. It was long ago fore|told, that the&s;e &s;hould be the effects and fruits of it. The wolf &s;hall dwell with the lamb; the leopard &s;hall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child &s;hall lead them: The lion and the bear &s;hall feed; their young ones &s;hall lie down together; the lion &s;hall eat &s;traw like the ox; and the &s;ucking child &s;hall play on the
<PB N="48" REF="020203_0047_0FAE3CA7EDB3A178">
hole of the a&s;p; and the weaned child on the cockatrice's den; they &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all my holy mountain, &s;aith the Lord. In that &s;trong figurative &s;tile, peculiar to the ori|ental nations, wicked men are repre&s;ented under the images of wolves lions, bears, &s;erpents, &amp;c. but it is foretold that by the influence of the go&s;pel, they &s;hould put off the ferocity of their nature and become harmle&s;s as lambs and little children. And this is no vi&s;ionary thing; the go&s;pel has in numberle&s;s in|&s;tances, produced this effect. It has transformed the mo&s;t wicked men into the mo&s;t amiable and u&s;eful members of &s;o|ciety. Why then &s;eek to change the chri&s;tian religion for any other. Hath a nation changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods? but my people, &s;ays God, have changed their glory for that which &s;hall not profit. Every nation under heaven will &s;tudy to advance and &s;upport the religion of their country, and indeed they cannot any other, until they know it; and why &s;hould not we &s;tudy to advance that which we have rea|&s;on to believe is the true religion; at lea&s;t it mu&s;t be granted even by dei&s;ts, that it has a better claim to that character, than any other in the world. It contains all the principles of natural religion, all its promi&s;es, all its precepts, and all its motives, and makes many valuable additions to them. No re|ligion comparable to it, to promote the peace, purity and feli|city of human &s;ociety. We &s;hould make a mi&s;erable exchange; if in&s;tead of it, we &s;hould embrace judai&s;m, mahometani&s;m, or heatheni&s;m. But were any profe&s;&s;ing the&s;e religions to come among us, it would be unju&s;t and again&s;t chri&s;tianity to re|&s;train them by force; or to dive&s;t them of any natural rights on that account; though con&s;i&s;tently enough they might be ex|cluded from places of power and tru&s;t in the government; becau&s;e offices in any government are not natural rights. Thus in my opinion all forms of religion, the principles of which, do not &s;ubvert the foundation of good government; may be &s;afely tolerated; but the man of no religion is the mo&s;t dan|gerous, and in fact is not a fit &s;ubject of moral government. In the ca&s;e of crimes again&s;t the &s;tate the perpetrators mu&s;t be puni&s;hed; and in the pre&s;ent degenerate &s;tate of &s;ociety among us, puni&s;hments will be often nece&s;&s;ary, they ought to be pro|perly apportioned, neither exceeding in &s;everity nor lenity, and punctually and inflexibly executed. Our rulers &s;hould &s;trike the blow at the root. Neglect and contempt of God, cur&s;ing, profane &s;wearing, violation of the &s;abbath, gaming and &s;uch
<PB N="49" REF="020203_0048_0FAE3CA8CE67B6B0">
evils, &s;hould feel their indignation; and as has been remarked, &s;uch puni&s;hments will be auxiliary to the grand de&s;ign of preventing crimes.</P>
<P>All that has been &s;aid above about the means of promoting re|ligion, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with all the rights of con&s;cience. For what is con&s;cience? Let us attend to the former definition of it, or to &s;um it up in fewer words, it may be called a per|ception of the obligation of the divine law. Can ever rea&s;on|able beings pretend then, that they are bound by the divine law to violate that law? or that they are bound in con&s;cience to ca&s;t off all con&s;cience. This is not much le&s;s ab&s;urd, than to &s;ay that a man is bound to jump down his own throat. Liberty of con&s;cience is out of the que&s;tion, when we &s;peak of the duties of morality; it is equally foreign to the que&s;tion, when we &s;peak of the plain e&s;&s;ential duties of religion, &s;uch as acknowledging God, revering his &s;acred name, keeping his &s;abbath; or at lea&s;t devoting &s;ome part of our time to his &s;er|vice, and the &s;eventh part is a rational and ea&s;y precept. Li|berty of con&s;cience extends only to &s;peculative opinions and modes of wor&s;hip. Full latitude in the&s;e ought to be granted. Our con&s;titutions and laws grant it; our civil rulers di&s;cover no di&s;po&s;ition to infringe it. To promote religion and virtue is therefore &s;o far from being a violation of the rights of con|&s;cience; that in fact, it is the only method to illuminate, di|rect and &s;trengthen con&s;cience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer of this publi&s;hed the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;eventh argument &s;everal years ago in Mr. London's paper of New-York; with a &s;incere de&s;ire to correct the extravagant ideas prevailing about religious liberty.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="8">8. The truth which we defend, is &s;upported by the uniform practice of all civilized nations. None of them pretend to erect or pre&s;erve civil government without laying the founda|tions of the fabrick in religious and moral &s;entiments. This is a fact not only in modern times; but if we look back in|to antiquity we &s;hall &s;ee it was equally the ca&s;e. It is a fact not only in nations called chri&s;tian; but was equally &s;o among the ancient heathen. Do we &s;ee any of the great legi&s;la|tors of antiquity treating religion with neglect or con|tempt? Nay, they earne&s;tly promoted it according to the light they had. And &s;ome of them to affect the con|&s;ciences of their citizens the more; pretended to receive their laws from the Gods. They were men of under&s;tanding and &s;en&s;e, and knew well, that unle&s;s they diffu&s;ed abroad
<PB N="50" REF="020203_0049_0FAE3CA96462C220">
the knowledge, fear and wor&s;hip of a deity; men are &s;uch creatures, that all human authority and power would be in|&s;ufficient to re&s;train them from the wilde&s;t outrages. It is allowed to be a good argument to prove the greate&s;t of all truths, the exi&s;tence of a &s;upreme being; that all nations in all ages have unanimou&s;ly agreed in it. The argument is e|qually good and conclu&s;ive in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Our ance&s;tors were men of deep under&s;tanding in the &s;cience of government. It was not for nothing, that they in their con&s;titutions and laws, paid &s;o much attention to religion. They may in &s;ome in&s;tances have run into error. But &s;ome in our days, in order to avoid their errors, have run into extremes equally if not more dangerous. The We&s;tmin&s;ter confe&s;&s;ion of faith &s;eems to give rather too much power to the civil magi&s;trate about the church. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages appear to have been adapted to civil e&s;tabli&s;h|ments of religion, which have no place in this country, and therefore are not applicable to our circum&s;tances. We ad|here to the confe&s;&s;ion in the&s;e, only in &s;o far as they are con|&s;i&s;tent with the rights of con&s;cience, the &s;piritual and independ|ent nature of Chri&s;t's kingdom, the principles above de|fined and e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the circum&s;tances in which provi|dence hath placed us.</P>
<P>Finally, let us on this &s;ubject attend to fact and experience. Who are the people that croud our gaols and load our gibbets? are they the &s;trict profe&s;&s;ors of the chri&s;tian religion? are they dragged from the&s;e religious &s;ocieties, where the pure doctrines of the go&s;pel are embraced? where God is wor&s;hipped with chri&s;tian &s;implicity and purity? and where a &s;trict &s;criptural di&s;cipline is maintained? By no means. And we fear not to appeal for the truth of this ob&s;ervation to the greate&s;t enemies of religion. Are duellers, murderers, thieves, robbers, adul|terers, fornicators, profane &s;wearers, and bla&s;phemers, to be found among the di&s;ciples of the humble and Holy Je&s;us? nay, there are examples of religious &s;ocieties con&s;i&s;ting of many thou|&s;and &s;ouls, of which we may boldly affirm, that in the &s;pace of half a century or more, not half a dozen of their members have &s;uffered by the hands of public ju&s;tice in any form. And it would be a mo&s;t proper expedient to elucidate this fact, that nations &s;hould keep regi&s;ters of all who &s;uffer for their crimes; but e&s;pecially whether they profe&s;&s;ed any religion, walked in communion with any church, and what their religion was; and publi&s;h the&s;e annually. This would bring fully to light, a truth
<PB N="51" REF="020203_0050_0FAE3CAD1712E7F8">
and fact, which would not reflect much honour on the ne|glecters and oppo&s;ers of religion. It would then appear, whe|ther the theatre or the church, whether &s;tage plays or the go|&s;pel, have the mo&s;t &s;alutary influence on the morals of mankind, and tend mo&s;t to promote the good order of civil &s;ociety. O ye advocates for theatrical entertainments, mimickry and non|&s;en&s;e, for duelling, gaming, balls, &amp;c. before &s;uch a repre&s;en|tation, you would blu&s;h as the owl before the &s;un! One might expect, were things conducted by rea&s;on in this world, that the above undeniable facts, would be &s;ufficient to induce civil communities, and their rulers; earne&s;tly to &s;tudy to promote true religion; and give proper checks to the &s;ources of corrup|tion and di&s;&s;olution above mentioned. They would not labour in vain. Good fruits would follow. All the virtues follow in the train of true religion.</P>
<P>On the whole we confe&s;s it is extremely difficult perhaps im|po&s;&s;ible, preci&s;ely to fix limits on this &s;ubject; or to &s;ay parti|cularly how far and no farther; communities &amp; rulers may go in their con&s;titutions and laws to promote religion and virtue a|mong them. That they ought not by any means to invade the prerogatives of the church, or infringe upon the rights of con|&s;cience, is undoubtedly true. But that in order to avoid this inva&s;ion and infringement, they ought to pay no attention to the &s;ubject; but permit the principles and bonds of the &s;o|cial union to be quite corrupted and di&s;&s;olved, is a mo&s;t dan|gerous and unrea&s;onable principle. This is the principle which I reprobate; and contend that as legi&s;lative bodies and ma|gi&s;trates, would &s;tudy the pre&s;ervation of the body politic, they mu&s;t in order to this, &s;tudy to promote religion and morality. The means to be u&s;ed are not ob&s;cure. They have been part|ly hinted. But the manner of applying the&s;e means; and how far civil authority may be &s;afely u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e; will require the deepe&s;t penetration and clo&s;e&s;t attention, to di&s;|cern. And no doubt much may be learned from experience.</P>
<P>I do not mean to intimate, that nothing of the kind, has been done in the United States. They have at lea&s;t given the fulle&s;t liberty to religion; that is, they declare they will not hinder or forbid it in any form. This is at lea&s;t favouring it in a negative way. But &s;urely it is of &s;o much importance to &s;ociety, as to merit &s;ome po&s;itive encouragement. We are convinced, that the idea of civil liberty entertained by many, amounts to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, or a rejection of all due &s;ubordina|tion.
<PB N="52" REF="020203_0051_0FAE3CAD24FFD128">
As to religion our ca&s;e is much wor&s;e; even &s;en&s;ible good men &s;eem to have carried their ideas of the &s;piritual na|ture of the church, and her independency on the civil powers, to a dangerous extreme. While many others fondly imagine, that the civil authority ought to pay no regard to religion and morality at all, but allow, not only the fulle&s;t liberty as to principles and forms of religion; but even permit all, to|tally to drop every principle and form of it, if they plea&s;e. This is the dangerous error we would wi&s;h to overthrow; be|ing per&s;uaded, that a man in &s;uch a &s;tate, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be a &s;ubject of moral government. There is no handle by which we can take hold of him; no principle by which we can bind him. We may &s;ubjoin here the words of a &s;en&s;ible writer on this &s;ubject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a piece, entitled, "True Patrioti&s;m, or Public Spirit, by Mr. Archibald Bruce, a member of the A&s;&s;ociate Synod of Edinburgh." The &s;ub&s;tance of which was delivered before &s;aid Synod. Let the ad|vocates for a &s;ervile &s;ubordination to that Synod, compare the&s;e ra|tional &s;entiments, with what they have publi&s;hed to the world as their principles on this &s;ubject.</NOTE>: It may be difficult, &s;ays he, always to pre&s;erve the di&s;tinction between the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, and the rights and powers belonging to each, without encroachment on the one &s;ide or the other. Tho&s;e powers which are co-or|dinate, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting together in the &s;ame time and place, and em|ployed about &s;ome objects in common, but in a different man|ner, will be in great danger of interference: rival&s;hip and mu|tual jealou&s;ies may be expected naturally to ari&s;e between them; and attempts will not be wanting to render one of them &s;ub|ordinate and dependent on the other: and, in fact, ever &s;ince the magi&s;trate became Chri&s;tian, the&s;e mutual &s;truggles and u&s;urpations have been almo&s;t unintermitting; and either the one or the other hath claimed, or actually exerci&s;ed, an undue &s;uperiority; &s;ometimes the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power overtopping, and ba&s;ely &s;ubjecting the temporal, as under the Papacy; or the temporal, in its turn, a&s;&s;uming a &s;upremacy and legi&s;lative authority in &s;piritual things, as hath been, and continues to be, vi&s;ibly the ca&s;e in many countries profe&s;&s;ing the Reformation, and appears to become &s;till more and more the ca&s;e in almo&s;t all nations of Chri&s;tendom, whether Prote&s;tant or Roman Ca|tholic; which is a new kind of political Papacy, no le&s;s dan|gerous and tyrannical than the former, rearing it&s;elf on the
<PB N="53" REF="020203_0052_0FAE3CAE7462F320">
ruins of the old. But yet in order to avoid one extreme, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of running into another. A church and com|monwealth may have certain connections together, and may perform mutual offices and duties towards each other, without lo&s;ing their peculiar di&s;tinctive characters, and without being ab&s;urdly blended together in one heterogeneous con&s;titution. A medium may be found, however hard to hit, between an E|ra&s;tian &s;upremacy and Sectarian anarchy; tyrannical &s;lavery and lawle&s;s licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"If indifference about the cau&s;e of God be culpable in others, how can it be excu&s;able or laudable in rulers? Are they, of all men, excepted from the authority of Chri&s;t? or are they the only per&s;ons who, by virtue of their office, are nece&s;&s;arily debarred from any po&s;&s;ibility of knowing with certainty <HI>what is truth?</HI> Or are they, upon &s;uch a di&s;covery, under the hard nece&s;&s;ity of neglecting, and, on the matter, renouncing it again; having their hands tied, in their official character, from &s;howing it any di&s;tingui&s;hed re&s;pect, or affording it any peculiar a&s;&s;i&s;tance; being equally obliged, in order to rule well, to nur&s;e up its oppo&s;ite with the &s;ame care and ten|derne&s;s? Mu&s;t the crown of Cae&s;ar and the crown of Chri&s;t be ever at variance, and incapable of any friendly alliance? Shall a cry be rai&s;ed among any, but &s;uch as have a mind that Chri&s;t &s;hould be crucified, that the man who &s;hall pa&s;s a &s;entence in favour of Chri&s;t from the judgment-&s;eat, is not "Cae&s;ar's friend," nor a friend to the natural rights and liberties of mankind? Or is the &s;ceptre &s;o profane, that it may not touch any thing that hath the image and &s;uper&s;cription of Je&s;us upon it? However &s;uch maxims &s;hould now be cried up as the quinte&s;&s;ence and height of good policy, and as containing the model of the mo&s;t perfect and happy government, I am afraid they can hardly be exempted from the charge of impiety.</P>
<P>"A magi&s;trate who, like <HI>Gallio,</HI> &s;hould account religious matters none of his care, in&s;tead of meriting hereby the title of a good magi&s;trate, would more properly de&s;erve that of an irreligious infidel or athei&s;t."</P>

<HEAD>The Reader is de&s;ired to attend to the following Notes:</HEAD>
<P><HI>Note for Page 15.</HI> There is doubtle&s;s an infinite &s;ufficiency in the death of Chri&s;t for all men, yea for all the fallen angels. This we may affirm without any danger of exaggeration. The blood of the Son of God was and is &s;ufficient to wa&s;h the foule&s;t devils white. But it mu&s;t be carefully ob&s;erved that the nece&s;&s;ity of an infinite atone|ment does not ari&s;e from the number but nature of &s;in. It is as nece&s;|&s;ary for the pardon of one &s;in, as ten thou&s;and&mdash;to the &s;alvation of one &s;inner as ten millions. It would eclip&s;e the glory of the divine character, and be as repugnant to his holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and moral go|vernment, to pardon one &s;inner without an atonement, as to pardon ten thou&s;and millions. For he that offends in one point, is guilty of all; and if one &s;in in its nature did not infer the nece&s;&s;ity of an infinite atonement to pardon, ten thou&s;and millions would not infer that ne|ce&s;&s;ity; becau&s;e degrees do not alter the &s;pecies or kind; numbers do not vary nature. If we then re&s;t the argument about the extent of Chri&s;t's death, on its infinite &s;ufficiency; that argument will extend it to all the devils as well as to all men; yea, to every thing that is in any manner affected by the &s;in of angels and men. If we do not build it on its &s;ufficiency, as indeed it is prepo&s;terous and ab&s;urd to do &s;o; then it mu&s;t re&s;t on the divine &s;overeignty. And in fact no other rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why God appointed his death for men and not for the fallen angels. Well then if the extent of his death re&s;ts on the divine &s;overeignty; the conclu&s;ion of that argument is, that Chri&s;t died ju&s;t for tho&s;e for whom God &s;aw meet to appoint his death. And it follows, that he died only for his &s;heep, I lay down my life for the &s;heep, or tho&s;e given to Him by the Father. Some will &s;ay this is di&s;couraging doctrine. But why di&s;couraging? For even &s;uppo&s;ing Chri&s;t &s;hed his blood for all men, it is clear from the bible that without faith in it, it would avail you nothing. And the &s;ame word a&s;&s;ures you, that if you believe in him, accept and &s;ubmit to him, you &s;hall be certainly &s;aved by him. Thus &s;uppo&s;ing the fal&s;e doctrine true, you are ju&s;t where you were, it could give you no more comfort than you now have. For if any accept of Chri&s;t as offered in the go&s;pel this a&s;certains the appointment of the death of Chri&s;t for him; on this ground he may &s;tand and look back into the eternal councils and &s;ee God appointing Chri&s;t's death for him.</P>
<P><HI>Note for Page 16.</HI> I have &s;aid that it would be no act of &s;trict di&s;tributive inju&s;tice, were Je&s;us Chri&s;t to co&s;t even true believers e|ternally from his pre&s;ence. This may at fir&s;t alarm &s;ome hone&s;t minds;
<PB N="55" REF="020203_0054_0FAE3CAF8E14D008">
I will therefore explain: By &s;trict di&s;tributive ju&s;tice I mean treating a per&s;on according to his per&s;onal merit or demerit: now were the &s;al|vation of true believers an act of ju&s;tice in that &s;en&s;e, it is manife&s;t, it could not be an act of mere grace and mercy; if they per&s;onally me|rited pardon and &s;alvation, they would be ju&s;tified by works, not by grace; but their &s;alvation is ever in the &s;criptures a&s;cribed to rich &s;o|vereign grace. Neither the act nor merit of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s can with propriety be &s;aid to be transfu&s;ed into believers &s;o as to become really their per&s;onal act and merit. But his complete righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;u&s;tained in law as the ground or rea&s;on of their ju&s;tification; and God is ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying them; di&s;tributive ju&s;tice can make no objection to their &s;alvation, though it do not require it. Ju&s;tification is not a real but a relative change: It is not the infu&s;ion of righteou&s;ne&s;s, but only placing righteou&s;ne&s;s to the per&s;on's account and treating him accordingly; all which is grace, not di&s;tributive ju&s;tice. But ju&s;tice taken in a large &s;en&s;e, in which &s;en&s;e it includes whatever is morally fit and proper to be done, certainly demands their &s;alvation. God mu&s;t be ju&s;t to him|&s;elf, true to his word, faithful to the promi&s;es of his grace and mercy, ju&s;t to reward the &s;ufferings of his Son and the fruits of his own gra|cious Spirit in the hearts and lives of true believers. Among many other texts that might be quoted in proof of my a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall only re|fer to <HI>P&s;. 51&mdash;11.</HI> Ca&s;t me not away from thy pre&s;ence, &amp;c. and indeed the whole P&s;alm is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <HI>P&s;. 130&mdash;3,</HI> if thou Lord &s;hould&s;t mark iniquity, O Lord! who could &s;tand, <HI>Lam. 3&mdash;22,</HI> it is of the Lord's mercies we are not con&s;umed, <HI>Mal. 3&mdash;6,</HI> I am God I change not therefore the &s;ons of Jacob are not con&s;umed, <HI>P&s;. 143&mdash;2,</HI> Enter not into judgment with thy &s;ervant, for in thy &s;ight &s;hall no fle&s;h living be ju&s;tified. And even tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who may be &s;tartled at the expre&s;&s;ion will ju&s;tify it in their prayers. They will freely confe&s;s God would be ju&s;t and his throne guiltle&s;s were he to ca&s;t them into hell. They pray for mere mercy; and this is the tenor of all their addre&s;&s;es to the throne of grace.</P>
