<HEAD>THE PRINCIPLE OF <HI>UNIVERSAL SALVATION</HI> EXAMINED AND TRIED. IN AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As you have appeared for many years pa&s;t, by your profe&s;&s;ion, to be &s;ound in the faith, you have been near to me by long acquaintance, and a number of your brethren. Therefore I feel di&s;po&s;ed (learning by your con|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">etime pa&s;t, that you have embraced the prin|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">iver&s;al</HI> and <HI>final &s;alvation</HI> of all men) to &s;end you, and tho&s;e that join with you, the following Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>You remember I told you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our conver&s;ation, I expect|ed &s;ome mini&s;ters, of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> principles <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ght be tempt|ed, in a &s;trait, to u&s;e certain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">are, too much as I have heard reported of lawyers u&s;ing points of law, viz. To try to make the jury <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it meant what they wanted it to mean, to an&s;wer their favorite purpo&s;es. But I ob&s;erved that after the jury had found by law and evidence that a criminal was verily guilty, and delivered their ver|dict that he mu&s;t be puni&s;hed with death, it would be great folly for any lawyer to try to make the court believe, the jury did not mean the criminal &s;hould die, but be cleared and made free. Agreeable to the forementioned &s;imile, I ob&s;erved that the LORD JESUS had declared his verdict how he &s;hould fare with the nations of the earth, at the day of judgment, according as they had believed and obeyed the go&s;pel, or not. By a parable of a &s;hepherd, having a large flock, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;heep and goats, dividing them apart,
<PB REF="034538_0003_0FFF23B0E7834F88" MS="y">the &s;heep from the goats, Math.ch.xxv. The clo&s;e of CHRIST's verdict expre&s;sly &s;ays, the nations, viz. who had not fed and cloathed him, &amp;c. &s;hould go away into everla&s;ting pun|i&s;hment ; but the righteous into life eternal. I a&s;ked you what you under&s;tood the nations on the left hand could mean, if it was not the &s;ouls and bodies of the wicked, fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, hypocrites, and di&s;obeyers of the go&s;pel, ri&s;en from the dead to the judgment, to receive their ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment, or to the &s;ame purport.&mdash;You &s;aid they meant mens' lu&s;ts and &s;ins; and added, you could make out by &s;cripture, if I under&s;tood you, that our lu&s;ts and &s;ins were called men, women, and children. I was &s;ure I had never read any &s;uch &s;criptures. Therefore concluded if it was made &s;o to appear, it mu&s;t be done by human and my&s;tical rea&s;onings, or ca&s;ting of figures, which tends to deceive the mind; I mean &s;trange comments upon ob&s;cure texts of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>However your mind is bewildered. I expect I &s;hall pro|duce demon&s;trative evidence to the unprejudiced, by a fair compari&s;on of expre&s;s &s;criptures, and undeniable con&s;e|quences drawn from expre&s;s &s;criptures, that you and all others are deceived, who believe and te&s;tify that Cain and all the old &s;inners before the flood, Pharaoh and his magi|cians, together with tho&s;e I&s;aiah &s;peaks of, that &s;hould be brought down to hell, al&s;o the &s;trong among the mighty, that &s;hould &s;peak out of the mid&s;t of hell, Ezek. ch. xxxii. Likewi&s;e the reprobate Phari&s;ees, and Judas, a devil, as CHRIST declares he was, and all whoremongers, fornicators, covetous, liars, and abominable idolatous, who have died in their &s;ins and appeared to their exit, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the cro&s;s of CHRIST; with their brethren, Gog and Magog. I &s;ay, that you, and all others who hold the aforementioned &s;in|ners (&s;o expre&s;sly condemned by GOD and all his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es) are &s;aved, you are deceived in a matter of great importance; and I cannot account for it, except it is bro't about by the &s;pirit of &s;orcery, which St. Paul mentions in Gal. chap. iii. if I under&s;tand him, he repre&s;ents the fal&s;e teachers as &s;piritual &s;orcerors, and their doctrine, &s;piritual witchcraft. <HI>O fooli&s;h Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you &s;hould not obey the truth,</HI> &amp;c. As &s;orcerors, by delud|ing the &s;en&s;es, make per&s;ons believe they &s;ee that which they truly &s;ee not; &s;o the &s;pirit of error, by ca&s;ting a mi&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="034538_0004_0FFF23E21177FC20">of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;on before the under&s;tanding, deludes it, and makes the per&s;on believe that to be truth, which, in fact, is not. Sorcerors make u&s;e of dark and unintelligible words, and &s;eem to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted beyond their own ability, in their performances. So, erroneous &s;pirits will generally quote the mo&s;t dark and ob&s;cure figures and texts of &s;cripture in the Prophets, and the revelations, who&s;e meaning is diffi|cult, particularly to de&s;cribe, and &s;eem to be &s;trangely a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in giving a meaning to them, to an&s;wer their favor|ite purpo&s;es. The&s;e things I have ob&s;erved, to my a&s;ton|i&s;hment, among the Shakers, and &s;ome deluded per&s;ons in the vicinity of Hamp&s;tead, &s;ome years pa&s;t. The LORD <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">lp all Chri&s;tians, who think they &s;tand, to take heed le&s;t they fall.</P>
<P>Having made this introduction, I proceed to con&s;ider your an&s;wer of what is the meaning of the nations on the left hand, at the judgment-day; which you &s;ay are lu&s;ts and &s;ins, and not their &s;ouls or per&s;ons. It looks to me, to talk of the exi&s;tence and puni&s;hment, pain and &s;uffering of &s;ins, lu&s;ts, and evil principles in men, when &s;eparated from tho&s;e who have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law of GOD; for &s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of law, and their per&s;ons made happy, who have &s;inned, is &s;uch a perfect contradiction to expre&s;s &s;cripture, to &s;ound rea&s;on, and &s;o regupnant to common <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, it is difficult to conceive how any hone&s;t man can be &s;atisfied with &s;uch a meaning, or ever believe what him&s;elf advances, allowing him to have his &s;en&s;es. How can we conceive that GOD or men could impri&s;on the crime of wilful murder, try it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ng it, and at the &s;ame time let the per&s;on of the murderer be free from impri&s;onment, condemnation, and death? What would a notorious thief care, if he was proved ever &s;o guilty of the greate&s;t theft, if the judge would only condemn the crime, but ju&s;tify the per&s;on of the thief; and comfort him with the promi&s;e that he &s;hould never feel a whip, nor hang in a halter, if he &s;hould &s;teal all the property of the country in which he lived? How would it &s;ound to rea&s;on or common &s;en&s;e to hear the judge &s;ay, Cur&s;ed be your thievi&s;h lu&s;t, for it is cruel; &s;end it into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment: Cur&s;ed be your wicked actions, &s;end them into everla&s;ting burnings. How can a mortal judge, or the judge of quick and dead, pun|i&s;h a crime &s;eparate from the criminal? Have mere crimes
<PB N="6" REF="034538_0005_0FFF23B3705AF3B8">got eyes to weep, or teeth to gna&s;h with? For, among tho&s;e nations there is to be weeping, wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth, which is impo&s;&s;ible for mere crimes to perform.</P>
<P>Further, if you, by your comments on figures, can make out that &s;ins or lu&s;ts are called men, women, and children, as you imagine, I would a&s;k you if they are called virgins, or &s;lothful &s;ervants, or if mere crimes can cry, LORD, LORD, open to us, or if they can do wonderful works in CHRIST's name? All the&s;e names and works were among the left hand nations, and if you cannot make out that lu&s;ts and &s;ins bear all the aforementioned names, and can perform &s;aid wonderful works, &s;eparate from the &s;ouls and bodies of rational per&s;ons, your ideas are fal&s;e and altogether im|aginary; and appear a flat contradiction, both to the unit|ed te&s;timony of the &s;criptures, and the nature and rea&s;on of things. For it is evident from the words that was de|clared from the unfeigned lips of our LORD and judge, Mat. chap. xxv. that the &s;lothful &s;ervants and fooli&s;h vir|gins were the &s;ouls and ri&s;en bodies of hypocrites and fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, brought to judgment; which CHRIST, in the 5th chapter of John, calls the re&s;urrection of damnation.</P>
<P>Further, con&s;ider, Sir, another &s;criptural idea. St. Pe|ter calls the day of judgment, a time of refre&s;hing to all that belong to the new covenant, Acts iii. 10. You hold, that all the per&s;ons in the black catalogue, aforenamed, belong to the new covenant: St. Paul &s;ays, Heb. chap. viii. that &s;uch as belong to the new covenant, their &s;ins and ini|quities GOD will remember no more. And Peter &s;peaks of their &s;ins being blotted out, forecited Acts ch. iii. How is it po&s;&s;ible their &s;ins can be remembered at the judgment, be publicly tried and condemned to everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, if all the human family belong to the right hand of CHRIST, as children of the new covenant? Can CHRIST and the A|po&s;tles &s;ay, and un&s;ay, about the &s;ame important point? One time declare their &s;ins &s;hall not be remembered, but be blotted out, another time bring them into everla&s;ting re|membrance, and condemn them to everla&s;ting puni&s;hment? Dear Sir, if you have any rea&s;on remaining in you, pau&s;e and &s;ee what contradictions and incon&s;i&s;tencies you have fell into in your mind, and behold how great is that dark|ne&s;s in you, which you call light.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034538_0006_0FFF23E3F99418D8">
Thus I have demon&s;trated, both from the words of CHRIST, and his Apo&s;tles, and from the nature and rea&s;on of things, that the nations on the left hand of CHRIST, &s;poken of, Matt. chap. xxv. cannot mean lu&s;ts and &s;ins.&mdash; Some of your denomination, being &s;en&s;ible, I conceive, of the ab&s;urdity of your ideas, &s;ay, that the nations on the left hand of CHRIST, mean devils.</P>
<P>I acknowledge &s;uch an interpretation doth not &s;hock common &s;en&s;e, &s;o much as the aforementioned, becau&s;e dev|ils are capable of puni&s;hment, and &s;ins are not &s;eparate from the &s;inner; yet it flatly contradicts every threatning, expre&s;&s;ed in the word of GOD, re&s;pecting the matter. For it is wicked men are threatened with puni&s;hment for their &s;ins, Mat. ch. xxv. not devils. CHRIST &s;ays the nations of the earth &s;hall be divided, &s;ome on the right hand, and &s;ome on the left. Are the devils called the nations of the earth? no, it is a name not given them any where in the &s;criptures, they are the legion of hell. Are devils called to feed and cloath CHRIST's members? no, they are not under &s;uch a law, neither are capable of &s;o doing&mdash; But the aforenamed nations, on CHRIST's left hand, were &s;ent into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, for not feeding and cloathing CHRIST, viz. in his members. Hence it is as ev|ident as words can make it, from CHRIST's own account, and the Apo&s;tles te&s;timonies, the nations on the left hand, Mat. ch. xxv. con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ouls and ri&s;en bodies of the families of Adam, and they mu&s;t go into everla&s;ting pun|i&s;hment, as &s;ure as the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon them, by the judge of quick and dead, is unalterable.</P>
<P>If what I have written doth not convince you, will you believe, if I can produce the expre&s;s te&s;timony of JESUS CHRIST; and the wi&s;e Solomon, and the learned and in|&s;pired Paul's te&s;timonies, that in&s;tead of &s;ins and lu&s;ts of wicked men, it is their &s;ouls mu&s;t be puni&s;hed and lo&s;t to all happine&s;s. If the&s;e three witne&s;&s;es are &s;ufficient to gain your credit, and are worthy to be believed, I will produce them re&s;pecting the matter. That the LORD who &s;pake to Mo&s;es, was the LORD JESUS, I expect you dare not de|ny. He &s;ays, re&s;pecting certain per&s;ons, who dare break his precepts, Exod. xii. 15. <HI>That &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from I&s;rael:</HI> al&s;o, Lev. xxiii. 30. <HI>That &s;ame &s;oul will I de|&s;troy.</HI> Mark viii. 36, 37. <HI>For what &s;hall it profit a man, if
<PB N="8" REF="034538_0007_0FFF23B4FB5233F8">he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> gain the whole world and lo&s;e his own &s;oul? Or, what &s;hall a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> give in exchange for his &s;oul;</HI> (not for his lu&s;ts and &s;ins.) Solomon &s;ays, <HI>He that committeth adultery with a woman, de&s;troyeth his own &s;oul,</HI> Prov. ch. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">i. Paul in Rom. ch. ii. has cleared the matter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> plain as words can expre&s;s it, particularly, when &s;peaking of the future rewards and puni&s;hments of &s;aints and &s;inners, he te&s;tifies,<HI>To them, who, by patient continuance in well-doing, &s;eek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life. But unto <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that are conten|tious, and do not obey the truth, &amp;c. tribulation and angui&s;h up|on every &s;oul of man that doeth evil.</HI> Words cannot be more expre&s;&s;ive upon the very point. Sir, if the&s;e three witne&s;&s;|es will not convince you, with what I have offered before, I query whether you would be convinced, if one &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead.</P>
<P>However, having a great de&s;ire to convince you, and all who are led a&s;tray with you, or by your in&s;tru|mentality, I will proceed to ob&s;erve, further, if I am mi&s;taken, with the greater part of the Chri&s;tian world, re|&s;pecting the true meaning of CHRIST'S verdict, pronounced in Mat. ch. xxv. if all Adam's family are to be finally &s;av|ed, and not one of them is &s;urely to die, as the &s;erpent de|clared to our mother Eve, we may &s;urely expect the kind Redeemer, who is full of grace, and was &s;ent to bear wit|ne&s;s to the truth, has &s;ome where in his la&s;t Te&s;tament, told us &s;o from his expre&s;s word? For he &s;ays, <HI>The word which I have &s;poken &s;hall judge him at the la&s;t day.</HI> Or if he has omitted it, we may ju&s;tly expect &s;ome of his Apo&s;tles have declared it. Now, if there is not one &s;entence in the New-Te&s;tament, by a fair compari&s;on of the whole, declares &s;uch a doctrine, and on the contrary, if CHRIST, in many places, be&s;ides the forecited Mat.ch.xxv. declares the fame truth concerning the final puni&s;hment of the wick|ed; and if his Apo&s;tles likewi&s;e te&s;tify the &s;ame repeatedly, is it po&s;&s;ible for a man, in his rea&s;on, who has a mu&s;tard-&s;eed grain of true faith, to embrace the ab&s;urd and un&s;criptural opinion, that there will not be one of Adam's family (who have rejected the atonement of CHRIST, di&s;believed the go&s;pel, and hated the cro&s;s of CHRIST, even to their death) that will finally peri&s;h?</P>
<P>Be&s;ide CHRIST'S verdict, Mat. ch. xxv. he &s;ays, ch. vii. <HI>Not every are that &s;aith unto me, LORD, LORD, &s;hall enter into
<PB N="9" REF="034538_0008_0FFF23E5AB3D1780">the kingdom of heaven.</HI> Hence it is evident that &s;ome who cried LORD, LORD, will be &s;hut out. Sins and lu&s;ts cannot cry LORD; therefore it mu&s;t be the per&s;ons of &s;ome of the children of Adam, ver. 22, <HI>Many will &s;ay to me, in that day,</HI> (viz.the judgment-day,) <HI>LORD, LORD, have we not praphe&s;ied in thy name, &amp;c. ca&s;t out devils, &amp;c. And then I will pro&s;e&s;s, I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity.</HI>&mdash;Dear Sir, lay your hand again&s;t your heart, and let con&s;cience &s;peak, can &s;ins and lu&s;ts prophe&s;y in CHRIST'S name? or can devils ca&s;t out devils? or, can ye that work iniquity, which are ca&s;t out, be the works of iniquity? You mu&s;t know the Engli&s;h grammar too well, not to &s;ee the di&s;tinction between tho&s;e that work iniquity, and the iniquity it&s;elf; or between the per&s;on, and the wicked works of the per&s;on. CHRIST further &s;ays, which mu&s;t put it out of all di&s;pute, that, <HI>them which do iniquity, &s;hall be ca&s;t into a furnace of fire,</HI> and at the judgment-day, <HI>there &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth,</HI> Mat. ch. xiii. Again, Mat. xii. 32. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;peaketh again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</HI> And Mark &s;ays, <HI>He hath never forgivene&s;s.</HI> Luke xvi. 22. <HI>The rich man al&s;o died and was buried: And in hell lift up bis eyes being in torment, &amp;c.</HI> It was not his &s;ins, which have no eyes, it was the per&s;on of the &s;inner, lifting up his eyes and begging for a drop of water; but there was no favor could pa&s;s over that great gulph of ju&s;tice, that is pronounced by CHRIST'S verdict, Mat. ch. xxv. In hell, he that is filthy, and he that is unju&s;t, mu&s;t &s;o remain, for the word of the LORD hath &s;poken it. Who, that have their &s;en&s;es, can read tho&s;e texts I have quoted, with their connections, and yet po&s;&s;i|bly &s;uppo&s;e, that there will be no unbeliever, no refu&s;er of mercy, no rich worldling of the nations of the earth, that will be found on CHRIST'S left hand, and condemned to everla&s;ting puni&s;hment; when CHRIST expre&s;sly declares they &s;hall, from his own &s;acred lips, forecited Mat. ch. xxv. Further, to &s;trengthen the evidence of the de&s;truction of the &s;ouls and bodies of tho&s;e who belong to the black cata|logue of characters I have before named, which may be all &s;ummed up under the term, WICKED, I will quote &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles' te&s;timonies, which will &s;hew how they un|der&s;tood it will fare with the aforenamed characters, at the judgment-day. 2 Cor. ch. ii. <HI>For we are unto GOD a &s;weet

Further, 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 12. <HI>That they all night be damned who believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> I will &s;um up the Apo&s;tle James' witne&s;s in his own words, ch. ii. ver. 13. <HI>For he &s;hall have judgment without mercy, that hath &s;hewed no mercy:</HI> which mu&s;t mean he &s;hall be puni&s;hed eternally.

And again, he expre&s;sly te&s;tifieth, that GOD has re&s;erved the wicked to the day of judgment. For what? To be puni&s;hed.

Let con&s;cience &s;tand judge. If the united te&s;timonies of the Old-Te&s;tament witne&s;&s;es may be &s;ummed up in the forecited text, the Univer&s;ali&s;t prin|ciple, I conceive, to be a full contradiction to them all; for the Univer&s;ali&s;ts &s;ay, it &s;hall be finally well with the &s;ouls or per&s;ons of the wicked as well as the righteous.&mdash; How &s;hall we know who bears the true witne&s;s? I&s;aiah in|forms us how we may know, in &s;uch a &s;trait, in all matters of importance. In the eighth chapter of his prophe&s;y, he warns every &s;incere, enquiring &s;oul, in&s;tead of &s;eeking un|to them that have familiar &s;pirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter, &amp;c. which I conceive to be the &s;pirit|ual &s;orcery mentioned by St. Paul; for erroneous &s;pirits peep into certain dark pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, and ob&s;cure figures, and &s;ay they find wonderful new light in them, and &s;eem to make their ideas look, for a time, as much like truth as the magicians of Egypt, by their &s;orcery, made their rods appear &s;erpents like unto the rod of Mofes. But as the rod of Mo&s;es &s;wallowed up their rods, in the end, &s;o all erroneous doctrines, when tried by the plain, expre&s;s law and te&s;timony, are &s;wallowed up: E&s;pecially the prin|ciple of Univer&s;al Salvation, I conceive, contradicts every ex|pre&s;s account of the day of judgment, &s;poken of by Daniel, by CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles, and thereby their beautiful arguments, and &s;eeming rea&s;ons, get &s;wallowed all up.&mdash; Therefore I&s;aiah directs us, ch. viii. ver. 20. to regard the law and the te&s;timony, and &s;ays, <HI>If they</HI> (viz. the promulgat|ors of &s;trange doctrines,) <HI>&s;peak not according to this word, it

<P>Who can read what I have written re&s;pecting the final puni&s;hment of the black catalogue of &s;inners, beforenamed, and not be fully convinced that the wicked, who die in their &s;ins will be everla&s;tingly puni&s;hed? If we had nothing but CHRIST'S own verdict to determine us re&s;pecting the matter, it is compleatly &s;ufficient. But I have produced the mo&s;t noted witne&s;&s;es in the Old-Te&s;tament, with the Apo&s;|tolic, in&s;pired jury, declaring their verdict again&s;t the fore|named criminals, and they agree with and corroborate the verdict of the Supreme judge, who is King of kings, and Lord of lords. Their united declarations a&s;&s;ure us that the wicked, who die in their &s;ins, will be puni&s;hed with an evenla&s;ting puni&s;hment in a future &s;tate. I conceive the holy &s;criptures give us as full a&s;&s;urance of it, as we have that CHRIST JESUS is the Son of GOD, the Saviour of be|lieving &s;inners. Verily, I do not conceive how we can doubt the te&s;timonies I have produced re&s;pecting the im|portant verdict without calling the whole in&s;pired volume in que&s;tion. No witne&s;s recorded in the Bible has &s;aid &s;o much of the future puni&s;hment of the wicked as CHRIST him&s;elf; and the rea&s;on is plain, becau&s;e no one knew &s;o much about it. We may &s;urely expect our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es, when giving in their final verdict re&s;pecting of a matter that &s;o nearly concerns all men of every capacity, has cho&s;en words that are mo&s;t plain and ca&s;y to be underftood. Whoever has the daring confidence to a&s;&s;ert the contrary, mu&s;t an&s;wer for it at his peril.</P>
<P>I never heard of any &s;ect in the chri&s;tian world, (except|ing the Univer&s;ali&s;ts) that pretended to put any other meaning to the words, <HI>nations of the earth,</HI> than what the words plainly expre&s;s. And, I conceive, if nece&s;&s;ity did not oblige them, being &s;en&s;ible that all their comments on other texts of &s;cripture, with all the ob&s;cure figures and my&s;terious metaphors that they pre&s;s into their &s;ervice, would be totally confounded, even by that one verdict giv|en by CHRIST, Mat. ch. xxv. they never would have invent|ed &s;uch an un&s;criptural meaning, and &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent to rea|&s;on it&s;elf, or ever had the confidence to &s;ay, that while they
<PB N="15" REF="034538_0014_0FFF23EC2B15B190">allow the word, nations, on the right hand, means the &s;ouls and ri&s;en bodies of men, &amp;c. the &s;ame word, nations, on the left hand, means &s;ins and lu&s;ts, or devils. I con|ceive it might be &s;aid, with as much &s;en&s;e and propriety, that the word, nations, on the left hand of CHRIST, means the unelean &s;pirits, like frogs, &s;poken of Rev. xvi. that came out of the mouth of the dragon, bea&s;t, and fal&s;e prophet, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If the evidence which appears on the very face of the&s;e texts, I have produced, is to be confronted with, and &s;et a&s;ide by other texts, which the Univer&s;alifts mu&s;t do or give up the point; it is evident they ought to be more in number&mdash;their te&s;timony more po&s;itive and expre&s;s&mdash;or their meaning more con&s;picuous, and le&s;s liable to mi&s;inter|pretation; which I have the confidence to &s;ay cannot be done, without procuring another Bible.</P>
<P>Origen, a learned teacher in the &s;chool of Alexandria, according to the be&s;t account lean get from authentic hi&s;|tory was the fir&s;t promulgator of the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation, ever heard of in the chri&s;tian world; which was about the middle of the third century: And to evade the evidence of CHRIST'S expre&s;s words, and the te&s;timonies of his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es again&s;t his doctrine, he maintained the nece&s;&s;ity of rejecting the literal &s;en&s;e of all &s;criptures, and &s;o reduced, by his expo&s;itions, the whole bible into an Al|legory, to &s;upport his principle. A crafty &s;cheme indeed, which would an&s;wer better in that ignorant age, than in our day. But, I conceive, he was a man of a di&s;tempered brain. For he held that all the fathers of the Old-Te&s;ta|ment ages were kept in hell till the death of CHRIST, when he went down into their pri&s;on, preached the go&s;pel to them, and carried them with him to heaven. He held the &s;tate between death and the re&s;urection, was a &s;tate of &s;leep in one common receptacle, called <HI>hades,</HI> by the Greeks; where the righteous and the wicked are repo&s;ed together promi&s;cuou&s;ly. Further, he held that the fire of the future world would puri&s;y the damned; &s;o that after a tempora|ry &s;uffering of its &s;everity; in which, however, none could be held longer than 1000 years, all the damned &s;pinits both of men and devils &s;hall be finally delivered from their woes.</P>
<P>He &s;trangely balanced his new-&s;angled go&s;pel, by add|ing that the highe&s;t favorite around the throne of GOD was &s;till left liable to fall from all his bli&s;s; and &s;o to be remand|ed
<PB N="16" REF="034538_0015_0FFF23BF70981BF8">back to a new &s;tate of trial in an earthly body. And thus the whole cele&s;tial choir of men and angels would continue filling up an eternity to come in alternate falls, trials, pur|gations, and re&s;torations, one after another.</P>
<P>I am informed that a number of great men, by Origen's influence, were entangled for awhile with &s;ome of his ideas; but in proce&s;s of time, they began to examine his doctrines by the law and te&s;timony; and Jerome, (who &s;ome Univer|&s;ali&s;ts would &s;ignify was of their opinion,) was the very man that detected and publicly expo&s;ed the errors of that &s;cheme, and had them judicially condemned by the unan|imous &s;entence of the Synod of Alexandria, in the year 399. The di&s;ciples of Origen were con&s;equently bani&s;hed from Egypt and Pale&s;tine, as enemies to religion, and a nui&s;ance to civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t it not look &s;trange, even to your&s;elf, dear Sir, and tho&s;e brethren entangled with you, to think that 250 years &s;hould roll round, after the doctrine of CHRIST was preach|ed to a peri&s;hing world, declaring that <HI>he that believeth &s;hall he &s;aved, and he that believeth not &s;hall he damned;</HI> and not one martyr, nor mini&s;ter of JESUS &s;hould find out that all the New-Te&s;tament, with its laws and penalties, as well as the Old-Te&s;tament, was a mere allegory: And although the judge of all &s;ays, that <HI>all that are in their graves &s;hall come forth, they that have done good to the re&s;urrection of life, and they that have done evil to the re&s;urrection of damnation:</HI> that it is not &s;o, it is no more than a &s;igure of &s;peech. I conceive the Univer&s;ali&s;ts to this day are obliged to make the &s;ame mi&s;erable &s;hift, having nothing better to &s;upport them. If appears to me, if Chri&s;tians who embrace &s;uch un&s;criptural ideas, are not in a religious delirium, or bewildered with the &s;pirit of &s;orcery, the&s;e cannot be &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P>The learned Dr. Chauncey being &s;en&s;ible, I conccive, of the fallacy and ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing the nations on CHRIST'S left hand, Mat. ch. xxv. mean either &s;ins, lu&s;ts, or devils, acknowledges, (if I under&s;tand him,) they mean what CHRIST &s;ays, viz. fooli&s;h virgins, hypocrites, &s;lothful servants, workers of iniquity, &amp;c. He grants &s;uch &s;hall sur&s;er the &s;econd death. But where as he had formed a &s;cheme finally to &s;ave the whole family of Adam, he was aware that it would not do to let the ark of the covenant, nor the te&s;timony &s;tand where the holy &s;criptures have put
<PB N="17" REF="034538_0016_0FFF23EE0DEB1470">them, according to our Engli&s;h tran&s;lation: And as he could not procure any of the &s;ons of Levi to carry it on their &s;houlders, as was the divine order under the oecono|my of Mo&s;es; neither any &s;uitable milch-kine among the Phili&s;tines to remove it where he would have it. Nece&s;&s;ity being con&s;idered above law, and his need being exceeding great to have the ark removed, or his whole &s;cheme would be lo&s;t forever; he has yoked up his grammatical know|ledge of the Greek and the doctrine of purgatory to|gether, and with this novel team and his &s;kill in driving it, it appears to me he has trailed it, having no new cart to put it in, about on the line between the land of I&s;rael and the border of the Phili&s;tines, where the tribes of I&s;rael have no divine warrant to a&s;&s;emble for divine wor&s;hip. But the wor&s;hippers of Dagon may draw near, the ark being partly &s;et within their line, if they can but procure a &s;ufficient num|ber of golden emerods and golden mice to make atonement to the GOD of I&s;rael, 1 Sam.ch.vi. they may all be deliv|ered, peradventure, from all their plagues, if they have been in hell ages of ages &s;uffering the &s;econd death, and be brought finally to give glory to the GOD of I&s;rael.&mdash; Notwith&s;tanding the Doctor's new meaning put to &s;ome words, I expect the tran&s;lators of our Engli&s;h bible have con|&s;trued &s;aid words truly: and had the Doctor under&s;tood CHRIST'S &s;aying, in John ch. vii. <HI>I go unto him that &s;ent me. Ye &s;hall &s;eek me, and &s;hall not find me: and where I am thither ye cannot come,</HI> he would have blu&s;hed and dropped his pen, and not have undertook by his new meaning, put to &s;ome Greek words, to deliver the damned out of hell, and &s;end them where CHRIST is, contrary to CHRIST'S expre&s;s de|claration.</P>
<P>But to abridge the an&s;wer to the new meaning of the Engli&s;h words, <HI>eternal, everla&s;ting, forever, forever and ever,</HI> and <HI>never, &amp;c.</HI> which the &s;aid Chauncey has put upon them, I will &s;um it up as follows: The Greek word which is u&s;ed &s;ix times to expre&s;s the duration of the puni&s;hment of the wicked, and tran&s;lated eternal and everla&s;ting (&s;ays a learned divine) is to be found in above &s;eventy places in the New-Te&s;tament: and it every where is evidently u&s;ed to expre&s;s an endle&s;s duration, unle&s;s tho&s;e &s;ix places which &s;peak of the duration of future puni&s;hment, be excepted. And is not this &s;ufficient to a&s;certain the meaning of the
<PB N="18" REF="034538_0017_0FFF23C3D9597C98">word, if we had no other way to determine what it is de&s;igned to expre&s;s? This word is <HI>Aionios,</HI> and is derived from <HI>Aion;</HI> which is u&s;ed above an hundred times in the New-Te&s;tament, and does not mean any certain, definite, but an indeterminate duration, unle&s;s it be limited by the words or &s;ubject, with which it is connected. And when the pre|po&s;ition, <HI>eis,</HI> is put before it, whether it be u&s;ed in the &s;in|gular or plural number, it always &s;ignifies an endle&s;s du|ration, and is generally tran&s;lated <HI>forever,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>never</HI>; of which there are near forty in&s;tances, only two of which re&s;pect, the duration of future puni&s;hment, viz. 2 Pet. ii. 17. Jude ver. 13. and no rea&s;on can be given why it &s;hould not be under&s;tood here, as it mu&s;t be in other places, where it is u&s;ed. When the words are doubled, they are more emphatical, and are tran&s;lated <HI>forever and ever.</HI> There are twenty-two in&s;tances of this, nineteen of which expre&s;s a duration which is certainly endle&s;s. In the remaining three, the duration of future puni&s;hment is ex|pre&s;&s;ed agreeably to what has been ob&s;erved. From this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, is it not ea&s;y to determine whether the&s;e words, which in all other in&s;tances are u&s;ed to expre&s;s a duration which is endle&s;s, mean only temporary, when they are u&s;ed with a de&s;ign to let us know what is the duration of future puni&s;hment? This expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>forever and ever,</HI> is &s;ound twenty-two times in the original, in the New-Te&s;ta|ment. It is u&s;ed eight times in the Epi&s;tles of St. Paul and Peter, where they a&s;cribe glory, honor, prai&s;e, and dominion to GOD, <HI>forever and ever.</HI> It is found fourteen times in the book of Revelations, and a number of them is u&s;ed to mark GOD'S eternity: and the word is u&s;ed three times in the &s;ame book, by the &s;ame writer, to de|note the duration of future puni&s;hment. Is it po&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take the meaning, and think that in the&s;e three in&s;tan|ces only, the&s;e words mean a finite duration? Such a &s;hift is offering violence to the &s;cripture.</P>
<P>As &s;ure as the &s;criptures referred to, mean in the original, what has been ob&s;erved, Dr. Chauncey's knowledge of the Greek cannot move the ark; but his &s;cheme is fallen, as Da|gon did of old time, upon its &s;tumps. Likewi&s;e, his ideas of damned &s;ouls being delivered from the &s;econd death and purged by what they &s;uffer, and go finally to heaven, after ages of ages, I think they are altogether un&s;criptural and
<PB N="19" REF="034538_0018_0FFF23EFF28D2D68">imaginary. There is no more expre&s;s &s;cripture to &s;uppors his opinion, than that there is a place of purgation in the moon to qualify the ungodly for the joys of heaven. The words of father Abraham, as they are &s;et forth by him who is to be judge at the la&s;t day, will confound all his arguments for the re&s;toration of the danmed, Luke xvi. 26. <HI>And be&s;ides all this, between us</HI> (the righteous) <HI>and you</HI> (the wicked) <HI>there is a great gulf fixed: &s;o that they which would pa&s;s from bence to you, cannot; neither can they pa&s;s to us, that would come from thence.</HI> This text informs us fully, that there can be no intercour&s;e between glorified &s;aints and damned &s;inners; but the &s;tate of &s;ouls, both in heaven and hell is unalterably fixed, as the oath of GOD is unchangea|ble. <HI>I have &s;worn, &s;aith the LORD, that they &s;hall not enter in|to my re&s;t</HI>: and damned &s;inners will never get out of the &s;econd death through &s;uch a gulf.&mdash;Thus it is evident from expre&s;s &s;cripture, the Doctor nor any of his opinion, can|not remove the ark nor the te&s;timoay from where the LORD has fixed it in its place.</P>
<P>Thus I have fini&s;hed my examination of the te&s;timony of CHRIST and his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es re&s;pecting how the fooli&s;h virgins, &s;lothful &s;ervants, hypocrites, and all unbe|lievers who die in their &s;ins, will be condemned and pun|i&s;hed at the great day of judgment. I have mentioned in the foregoing Epi&s;tle &s;omething concerning the doctrines of devils. And as it is of great importance for us to know the difference between the &s;pirit of truth, and the &s;pirit of error, I &s;hall ob&s;erve St. Paul informs us, in 2 Cor. ch. xi. of deceitful workers, and &s;ays, <HI>No marvel; for &s;atan him&s;elf is transformed into an angel of light.</HI> Therefore it is no great thing if his mini&s;ters al&s;o be transformed as the min|i&s;ters of righteou&s;ne&s;s; who&s;e end &s;hall be according to their works; that is, I conceive, working deceitfully, preaching for their ma&s;ter &s;atan; and perhaps they may be &s;elf-deceived, thinking they are mini&s;ters of right|eou&s;ne&s;s: &s;uch may appear among all denominations; and that we may know how to di&s;tingui&s;h them apart, St. Paul informs us in his Epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, ch. xiii. <HI>Remember them which have the rule over you,</HI> (viz. the Apo&s;tles) <HI>who have &s;poken unto you the word of GOD, &amp;c.</HI> and adds, <HI>Be not carried about with divers and &s;trange doctrines, &amp;c.</HI> Hence it is evident every doctrine which is divers and contrary
<PB N="20" REF="034538_0019_0FFF23C5F8E67B88">to the expre&s;s doctrine of CHRIST and his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es, is a &s;trange doctrine; which I under&s;tand, St. Paul means by the doctrines of devils, that in the latter times, &s;ome, by departing from the faith and giving heed to &s;educing &s;pi|rits, would fall into, 1 Tim. ch. iv. We find the &s;pirit of error is moveable, it is hard to trace it; for one &s;ays this doctrine is right, another &s;ays a contrary doctrine is right, and all cloaked under a pretence that the &s;criptures mean as they &s;ay. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve the devil was to go upon his belly, after he told the lie to our mother Eve, <HI>Thou &s;halt not &s;urely die;</HI> that is, he was cur&s;ed to be a creeper, never more to dare appear in his own name, and &s;ay I am a devil; but always be obliged to creep under the names of great-light, wonderful-truth, and real-friend&s;hip to the &s;ons of men, or &s;ome other borrowed name or friendly pre|tence. Therefore, to give as plain and &s;hort a &s;pecimen, or &s;ample of the doctrines of devils as I can, I will &s;ay.</P>
<P>Glad tidings, glad tidings, rejoice all ye &s;ons of Belial, &s;hout aloud ye workers of iniquity, join all ye that contemn experimental, heart religion, and real piety, who are puff|ed up with pride and drowned in wantonne&s;s, with all that hate the daily cro&s;s of CHRIST; like wi&s;e all the children of di&s;obedience of every character, even all that have bla&s;|phemed again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and have done de&s;pite to the &s;pirit of grace, I have glad tidings to proclaim to you all. You &s;hall not &s;urely die, that is, finally. This is &s;crip|ture. You may read it a&s;&s;erted in Gen. iii. 4. and if you doubt it becau&s;e a fallen angel &s;aid it, you may ob&s;erve he did not lo&s;e his light and knowledge of things, although he left his beginning. It is evident from expre&s;s &s;cripture, he &s;everal times &s;pake the truth, and why not in the fore|cited text: but if you are not &s;atisfied, I can produce you abundant proof from the &s;ayings of CHRIST and his Apo&s;|tles, and you may judge whether it does not plainly declare the &s;ame &s;en&s;e with the forecited text. CHRIST &s;ays, he did not come into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be &s;aved. Can you think he will fail of an&s;wering the end he came for!&mdash;Again, it is written, he ta&s;ted death for every man, and is a propitia|tion for the &s;ins of the whole world. Do not the&s;e texts &s;ully prove what was declared to our mother Eve, in the &s;orecited texs, Gen. iii. 4.? Are they not &s;ull to the point
<PB N="21" REF="034538_0020_0FFF23F3E5C261C0">as I have quoted them? Judge for your&s;elves. Be not frighted by a parced of &s;niveling prie&s;ts, trying to &s;care you to death by fire and brim&s;tone, that that eternal hell which has been &s;o often a terror to you, and &s;ometimes re&s;trained you in your wild career, and often embittered your golden cup of plea&s;ure, is now no more. We have got a di&s;cov|ery in this age of rea&s;on, of true &s;cripture light, and find that hell and damnation is to take place only on your &s;ins and lu&s;ts. Our antient and modern divines have made a mi&s;take, and mi&s;applied it as Job's friends in another ca&s;e did concerning him. Cheer up ye &s;inners of every charac|ter, your precious &s;ouls and ri&s;en bocties are all to be glo|ritied in heaven forever, after the day of judgment; for CHRIST has been lifted up upon the cro&s;s, has bore the cur&s;e and put an end to &s;in, and declared with his own ble&s;&s;ed lips, he will draw all men unto him. This damna|tion of hell and everla&s;ting puni&s;hment that has been &s;ound|ing in your ear-drums from every pulpit for ages pa&s;t, a|mong all denominations of Chri&s;tians, excepting us the univer&s;al friends, of all men, we have found to be mere prie&s;t-craft, or at lea&s;t, a great mi&s;take among the be&s;t of them. The LORD JESUS never intends finally to execute any threatnings contained in the New-Te&s;tament, again&s;t any per&s;on or per&s;ons whom&s;oever. For it is written, <HI>He ta&s;ted death for every man:</HI> And if you want all I have &s;aid proved, read 1 Tim. ii. 4. <HI>Who will have all men to be &s;aved and come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> Now judge, all ye jovial &s;inners, of every character be&s;oronamed, if I have not proved to a demon&s;tration, that what was told our mother Eve in the garden, forecited Gen. iii. 4. is exactly ac|cording to the declarations of CHRIST and his holy Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>In this &s;ample of the doctrines of devils, you may &s;ee what St. Paul calls deceitful working, 2 Cor. ch. xi. or u&s;|ing &s;ubtilty, as he &s;ays the &s;erpent beguiled Eve, ver. 3. I have took as much of a &s;entence of &s;cripture as &s;erved my purpo&s;e, de&s;ignedly, leaving out that part which would have made a di&s;tinction; and by a fair compari&s;on of oth|er &s;criptures, which &s;peak particularly re&s;pecting the final de&s;truction of the characters beforenamed, would have al|together changed the &s;en&s;e I have put upon them. Thus by handling the word of GOD deceitfully, in the &s;everal texts I have quoted, I have &s;eemed to prove that the dev|il,
<PB N="22" REF="034538_0021_0FFF23CAD938E8C0">who is recorded a liar from the beginning, John ch. viii. and the holy Son of GOD, who is the way, the truth, and the life, with his holy Apo&s;tles, have unitedly bore one and the &s;ame re&s;timony, re&s;pecting mens' final end. Whereas it is evident from a fair compari&s;on of expre&s;s &s;criptures, as I have already manife&s;ted, in examining the united verdict of the in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es of both Te&s;taments, there is no more concord between their te&s;timonies re&s;pecting the mat|ter, and the declaration of the devil, than there is between heaven and hell.</P>
<P>I have not &s;o much as mentioned any nece&s;&s;ity of believing in JESUS, in order to be ju&s;tified; nor any need of repenting of &s;in, or obeying the go&s;pel that our &s;ins may be blotted out, nor any need of for&s;aking all our carnal delights, taking up our daily cro&s;s, and following the LORD JESUS in keeping his commandments; this would have &s;poiled my joyful &s;ound, in the &s;ample, and overthrown all the glad tidings I proclaimed, in the &s;en&s;e I propo&s;ed them. Neverthele&s;s, it is a truth too &s;erious and important for me to forget, and I pray GOD that all Chri&s;tians may ever remember it. The LORD JESUS has &s;aid, without faith, repentance, and taking up the daily cro&s;s, aforementioned, we cannot be his di&s;ciples: And what mortal dare contra|dict the judge of the quick and the dead, as it were, to his very face? I think none but the mini&s;ters of &s;atan, who are led blindfold at his nod, would dare creep under the &s;weet name of glad tidings, and leave out the aforemen|tioned truths. For every experimental Chri&s;tian mu&s;t know, he can no more enjoy fellow&s;aip with the Father, with the LORD JESUS, and with the living brethren; nor have his calling and per&s;onal election made &s;ure to him|&s;elf, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and practi&s;ing the aforementiomed truths; than a &s;inner can truly &s;ee the kingdom of GOD, in its &s;piritual beauty, without being born again, or from above. The one cannot, is as certain as the other, for the mouth of the &s;ame LORD hath &s;poken it.</P>
<P>I have put a fal&s;e &s;en&s;e upon every text I have quoted in the &s;ample, and the con&s;equences are fal&s;e accordingly; &s;o that the whole &s;umple is one continued compound of lies in the &s;en&s;e I have proclaimed it to the a&s;orenamed characters. For, according to the &s;en&s;e I have put upon &s;everal texts, I have denied the execution of any thread
<PB N="23" REF="034538_0022_0FFF23F59CF9FFD0">nings, declared in the New-Te&s;tament, again&s;t any un|godly &s;inner what&s;oever, finally; for I have not except|ed them that have committed the unpardonable &s;in, which CHRIST has particularly excepted, three times, in his la&s;t will; and declares it never &s;hall have forgivene&s;s. Yet I have &s;eemed to prove it, to an inattentive mind, and e&s;pe|cially to tho&s;e who would be glad to have it &s;o.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you my ideas how the devil appears like an angel of light, to &s;inners who are under the power of a fle&s;hly mind, and how his mini&s;ters appear like mini&s;ters of rightcou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir, if you, who in years pa&s;t could, as it were, have giv|en me your eyes, will not now count me your enemy be|cau&s;e I tell you the truth, I will yet &s;peak, and further &s;ay, that I conceive the &s;ample, forecited, is what I can make appear by &s;everal publications of the Univer&s;ali&s;ts and their catechi&s;e, to be the very doctrine they proclaim for the true Apo&s;tolic go&s;pel; as to the general &s;en&s;e of it: and they have put the &s;ame general &s;en&s;e upon the texts I have quot|ed in the forenamed &s;ample, if I under&s;tand their writings. Perhaps you will &s;ay they do not proclaim their go&s;pel in the bold, plain manner that I have. I grant it. But the only difference, I think, is this, viz. creeping on the belly, and leaving that part of revealed truth, or perverting of it, that does not &s;init their favorite purpo&s;e, and making, as it were, any thing, and every thing, of texts, where the letter of thern &s;eems to &s;ound &s;uitable to their minds, frequently &s;eparating them from their connexions. Whereas, in the forenamed &s;ample, I have &s;et the doctrines upright upon their proper foundation, as I conceive, viz. the lie &s;poken of, forecited, Gen. iii. 4. I have expo&s;ed the belly of the doctrines, in&s;tcad of being hid in the du&s;t, or under leaves, gra&s;s, or bu&s;hes. And I hone&s;tly &s;ay, as in the fear of GOD, I &s;ee no other real difference between the doctrines contained in the &s;ample, and the principles of the univer|&s;ali&s;t, but my want of ability to communicate the matter in &s;uch a ma&s;terly manner as &s;ome univer&s;ali&s;t may be a|ble to do. Yet, let it be ob&s;erved, I do not &s;ay any uni|ver&s;ali&s;t perverts the aforecited texts, or any other de&s;ign|adly, as I have done in the &s;ample.</P>
<P>I expect, that you, Sir, and many others, think you are doing GOD &s;ervice, while you are preaching and doing
<PB N="24" REF="034538_0023_0FFF23CC63AC8D98">many things, as I conceive, contrary to the name, author|ity, and expre&s;s verdict of JESUS CHRIST and his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es, re&s;pecting the day of judgment, and the nece&s;&s;i|ty of becoming holy here in time, <HI>without which,</HI> GOD's word te&s;tifies, <HI>no man &s;hall fee the LORD.</HI> Likewi&s;e, your denying that the penalty of the law of CHRIST is finally executed upon any &s;oul of man, in&s;tead of every &s;oul of man that doth not obey the truth, but doeth evil, as the apo&s;tle te&s;tifies.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, Sir, there is a query ari&s;es in your mind, that if I have perverted the true &s;en&s;e of a number of texts, to make out my proclamation in the forementioned &s;ample, I ought to give the &s;criptural, con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e of them.&mdash; I will endeavour to do it&mdash;according to my ability.</P>
<P>It is evident from the &s;criptural account given us, that the bar which was in the way of the &s;alvation of any one of mankind, was the broken law of GOD; in order there|fore to have &s;aved Abel only, the law mu&s;t have been com|pleatly fulfilled, ju&s;tice &s;atisfied, the Deity atoned, and every divine perfection harmonized: &s;o that peace and good will might take place upon Abel, con&s;i&s;tent with GOD's highe&s;t glory. In point of merit, therefore, CHRIST has fulfilled the law, and an&s;wered every demand GOD the Father could call for, by virtue of it. Accordingly, the Father has committed all power in heaven and upon earth into his hands, as Mediator, to kill or make alive, to wound or heal at his plea&s;ure. He has in this re&s;pect &s;aved all the family of Adam from the penalty of the law falling upon them, immediately; &s;o that if a &s;inner &s;hould live an hundred years, and then die accur&s;ed, the long re|demption from the grave and hell, would be owing to the redemption of CHRIST, with all the mercies, more in num|ber than the hairs of his head, that he had received in his life time.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t have been as much done to harmonize the divine perfections in &s;aving Abel, as to &s;ave all Adam's family. Had it not been for the ample atonement made by CHRIST, the &s;ins of men had barred the way of their &s;alvation, and mercy could not have been extended to them. CHRIST, in making atonement for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law, has received power, as Mediator, over all fle&s;h, yea, all power in heaven and in earth is given unto him.
<PB N="25" REF="034538_0024_0FFF23F7287C3260">In this &s;en&s;e, which is a &s;criptural and proper &s;en&s;e, <HI>He has ta&s;ted death for every man, and is the propitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world.</HI> This &s;en&s;e opens an ea&s;y, plain, and important meaning to the pa&s;&s;ages aforenamed in the &s;am|ple, and to all other texts of like import in the new-te&s;ta|ment. In this &s;en&s;e, he bought them which <HI>bring in damnable here&s;ics, even denying the LORD that bought them, and bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction,</HI> 2 Pet. ii. I. In this &s;en&s;e, the reprobate Jews, after all things were ready, were invited, there being &s;ufficient provi&s;ion, and to &s;pare, in point of righteou&s;ne&s;s and merit, the aforenamed bar being removed, and nothing hindered but the bar of their unbelieving hearts and proud wills, de&s;pi&s;ing and making light of the heavenly invitation, which was the cau&s;e of their never being admitted to ta&s;te of the &s;upper. In this &s;en&s;e, <HI>he gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, he died for all,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will draw this con&s;equence, as many others do who are not of your principle, viz. If CHRIST died for all men, then all will be &s;aved, or el&s;e he died and &s;hed his blood partly in vain. I an&s;wer that it does not follow, but is an un&s;criptural and imaginary con&s;equence. The immediate fruit and effect of CHRIST'S death, is not the actual di&s;charge of any per&s;on from guilt, but as CHRIST him&s;elf has a&s;&s;ured us, that <HI>who&s;oever believeth on him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life,</HI> John iii. 16. Our &s;alva|tion is con&s;idered in &s;cripture in a two-fold view, viz. as it is wrought by CHRIST'S merits, and as it is applied by the &s;pirit to the believer through the word. In the &s;ir&s;t in|&s;tance, a foundation is laid for our deliverance; in the la&s;t, we experience, through faith, actual and per&s;onal de|liverance. It is as true as the bible, that many are re|deemed by price, as before ob&s;erved, who are not redeem|ed by power, I humbly conceive. David &s;peaks of &s;uch as had experienced the power in P&s;al. cvii. Let the re|deemed of the LORD &s;ay &s;o, <HI>whom he hath redeemed out of the hand of the enemy. Tho&s;e are the redeemed who &s;hall ob|tain gladne&s;s and joy, and from whom &s;orrow and mourning &s;hall flee away,</HI> I&s;a. li. 11. They who are bought by price in the &s;en&s;e before mentioned, but not by power, <HI>who repro|bated them&s;elves by denying their LORD,</HI> are &s;poken of foreci|ted, 2 Pet. ii. It would fill a &s;mall volume to quote all the texts that te&s;tify the fact and makes the di&s;tinction I
<PB N="26" REF="034538_0025_0FFF23CDEFA60B38">have ob&s;erved. In 1 Tim. iv. 10. St. Paul makes the di&s;|tinction I have been ob&s;erving, as plain as words can ex|pre&s;s it. For he &s;ays, <HI>GOD is the Saviour of all men, &s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe.</HI> It is only the blood of CHRIST, as ap|plied by the &s;pirit, which effects the per&s;onal <HI>forgivene&s;s of &s;ins,</HI> Col i. 14. <HI>purges the con&s;cience of the believer from dead works,</HI> Heb. ix. 14. If you &s;till object, that if CHRIST has &s;atisfied law and ju&s;tice, they can have no claim on the &s;in|ner. This objection only befits &s;uch as hold eternal ju&s;tifi|cation; notwith&s;tanding it is made the re&s;ort of numbers of different de&s;criptions. But if divine ju&s;tice has no de|mand again&s;t &s;inners for whom CHRIST has ta&s;ted death, as before de&s;cribed, then &s;uch were never per&s;onally chil|dren of wrath, nor under the cur&s;e; neither can there be any per&s;onal deliverance from ruin, to which they were never per&s;onally expo&s;ed. If rea&s;oning according to the objection be ju&s;t, the te&s;timonies of &s;cripture, and &s;piritual illumination are mere deceptions of the &s;en&s;es, as philo&s;o|phers &s;ay of colours. But to an&s;wer the objection. If a creditor &s;hould exact a ju&s;t debt of a number of in&s;olvent debtors, and they were both unwilling and unable to pay, and mu&s;t immediately &s;uffer the rigor of the law. Provid|ed a &s;urety an&s;wered all demands to the honor of the law, and took the in&s;olvent debtors into his hands, are not the debtors, according to all law and equity, in the power of the &s;urety? and to be dealt with by him according to law, or mercifully to have his or their debts remitted, in &s;uch a way as the &s;urety &s;hall propo&s;e? How repugnant to rea|&s;on and common &s;en&s;e would it appear to hear the debtors &s;ay, they were clear of all their debts; for a &s;urety had paid them: although they had not paid &s;aid &s;urety a far|thing, nor had thanked him, nor received any di&s;charge from him. Thus, I conceive, <HI>JESUS the &s;urety of the new covenant,</HI> Heb. vii. <HI>comes to &s;ulfill his Father's will,</HI> Heb. x. pays the debt of duty and &s;ufferings which man could ne|ver pay, and thus <HI>ta&s;ted death for every man</HI>; and thus buys not only Jews, but the heathens al&s;o, with the inhabitants of the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth. GOD the Father re|cognizes his right&mdash;all power re&s;pecting the family of A|dam devolves upon him&mdash;<HI>he is anointed as mediator with the oil of gladne&s;s above his &s;ellows,</HI> P&s;al. xlv. The 2d P&s;alm de&s;cribes this &s;ubject very clearly. The Father &s;ays, <HI>a&s;k
<PB N="27" REF="034538_0026_0FFF23F8E0CA5920">of me</HI> (and not a de&s;tined number of individuals only) <HI>but I &s;hall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utter|mo&s;t parts of the earth for thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI>; but tho&s;e, who refu&s;e his rule and government, <HI>he will break with a rod of iron, and da&s;h in pieces like a potter's ve&s;&s;el,</HI> ver. 8 and 9.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;hewed a &s;criptural &s;en&s;e to all tho&s;e texts a&s;orementioned, re&s;pecting CHRIST'S dying for all, and being a Saviour of all men, &amp;c. This plain account of the end, and immediate effect of our <HI>Saviour's &s;ufferings, obedience and death, for which he was crowned with re&s;urrection, glory and honor,</HI> Heb. ii. 9. furni&s;hes a full an&s;wer re&s;pecting CHRIST'S being <HI>li&s;ted up and drawing all men unto him,</HI> John xii. 32.&mdash; <HI>for he &s;pake it concerning the manner of his death.</HI> Occa&s;ion was given by being lifted up upon the cro&s;s unto death, to give te&s;timony unto all men of his power to rai&s;e him|&s;elf from the dead; and that he will by the &s;ame power rai&s;e the whole family of Adam from the dead, Acts xvii. 32. <HI>and will draw all men unto him to judgment</HI>; that is, <HI>he will gather together all nations,</HI> Matt. xxv. St. Paul &s;o fully clears up this &s;en&s;e of the forecited text, in the 15th chap. of his i&s;t epi&s;tle to the Cor. it needs no other comment.&mdash; I proceed to con&s;ider the meaning of the la&s;t mentioned text in the &s;ample, viz. 1 Tim. ii. 4. <HI>who will have all men to be &s;aved and come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> I intimat|ed in the &s;ample, that the word WILL was GOD's decree|ative, intentional, authoritative will, that never can be al|tered nor di&s;obeyed. If the text means &s;o, it would be as unalterable as the verdict aforementioned, and would be as full a contradiction to the te&s;timony of CHRIST and his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es, re&s;pecting the end of finally impenitent &s;inners, as nay is to yea. Therefore, in order to reconcile this text with all of like import, and &s;hew its agreement with the aforementioned verdict, I mu&s;t con&s;ider &s;ome &s;criptural ideas re&s;pecting election, or GOD's decreeative will: which would not be difficult to de&s;cribe, if there had not been heretofore &s;uch &s;training, racking and crowning with thorns, and even cruci&s;ying of &s;everal texts of &s;crip|ture, as far as can be done, I conccive, to an&s;wer favorite purpo&s;es. While one &s;ect &s;ays, GOD's decreeative will, ac|cording to the &s;criptures, is to &s;ave all Adam's family, and no more. Others &s;ay it means to &s;ave all the fallen angels. Others &s;ay in means to re&s;tore all things, even the whole
<PB N="28" REF="034538_0027_0FFF23CF8D6D4568">creation of bea&s;ts and creeping things, &amp;c. Others &s;ay it means a remnant of the human family only, who have been already brought forth by the womb of time, &s;ince the crea|tion: But they further &s;ay GOD's will is to regenerate millions in the latter end of time, during a number of ages, &s;o that when the general judgment &s;hall take place, there will be more &s;aved than will be lo&s;t in perdition. If equal credit may be given to all the a&s;orementioned opinions, what a variety of unalterable wills exi&s;ts in the Deity; and how different their intentions and extent. All the aforemen|tioned opinions are agreed in one thing, viz. that GOD's decreeative will re&s;pecting the&s;e matters was before|time. Others, with equal confidence &s;ay, concerning &s;in|ners &s;alvation or damnation. GOD's decreeative will determines nothing before they have a day of vi&s;itation: and if they, in &s;aid day, chu&s;e GOD for their portion, then GOD chu&s;es them for his inheritance. Hence we may learn the con&s;equences of undertaking to look into the &s;e|cret things which belong to GOD only to know, and bring to pa&s;s. Such, I conceive, would do well to learn what that meaneth, where GOD &s;mote fifty thou&s;and three-&s;core and ten of the inhabitants of Beth-&s;heme&s;h for looking into the ark, 1 Sam. ch. vi. How many thou&s;ands of profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians have been &s;mote with death, in a religious &s;en&s;e, and have cau&s;ed divi&s;ions and contentions contrary to the plain doctrine of CHRIST and the law of brotherly love, through the chri&s;tian world, by peeping and trying to look into &s;uch &s;ecret things as are not particularly explained in the holy &s;criptures, and making them mean what they would have them, by their artful rea&s;onings and con&s;equen|ces. Hence ari&s;es the confu&s;ion of opinions aforenamed, with many heretical principles of different &s;ects. Some holding the ju&s;tification of &s;inners from eternity, having no regard to the moral agency of men; but drown all our ideas in the decreeative will, both concerning the &s;alvation and damnation of the &s;ouls of the family of Adam. Others, by their rea&s;onings and con&s;equences make the &s;ame de|creeative will a mere nullity. Indeed, the confu&s;ion of ideas is &s;o great, as to what is the meaning of GOD's decreeative will, that if one man &s;hould a&s;k another what religious pro&s;e&s;&s;ion he was of, and he &s;hould an&s;wer, I am a &s;incere believer that JESUS CHRIST is the Son of GOD, I am fully
<PB N="29" REF="034538_0028_0FFF23FB35F5D3D8">per&s;waded that unle&s;s a man be born again, or of the &s;pi|rit, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of GOD in its &s;piritual beau|ty, it con&s;i&s;ting in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Ho|ly Gho&s;t; and tru&s;t through grace I have experienced it; and pro&s;e&s;s to be an hone&s;t, apo&s;tolic chri&s;tian, fully believ|ing all the principles of the doctrine of CHRIST, as expre&s;&s;|ed in the New-Te&s;tament; and find my&s;elf bound, and willing to obey the laws and ordinances enjoined therein, according to my ability: how &s;hould we know by all he profe&s;&s;ed whether he is &s;ound in the faith? We could not judge but little about it, according to the opinion of many, becau&s;e he had not declared in what &s;en&s;e he under&s;tood GOD's decreeative will, or election; that being the great criterion by which he mu&s;t be deemed &s;ound, or heterodox.</P>
<P>If the man had &s;aid, I am a Lutheran chri&s;tian, or a Calvini&s;tic chri&s;tian, an Arminian chri&s;tian, a Methodi&s;t, a Univer&s;ali&s;t, or an Hopkintonian chri&s;tian, he would have been under&s;tood. If he had owned either of the aforenam|ed leaders opinions, doubtle&s;s he would be pronounced &s;ound in the faith, by one &s;ect, and perhaps condemned as erroneous by all the others. But from whence aro&s;e the puzzle? Becau&s;e the man profe&s;&s;ed the apo&s;tolic chri&s;tian|ity, and did not di&s;tingui&s;h his principles by any modern name. Hence we &s;ee what a confu&s;ion the pre&s;ent gene|ration of chri&s;tians are in, by hearkening to tho&s;e popular leaders of modern date, and paying more attention to &s;ome of their my&s;tical and allegorical rea&s;onings, and comments upon certain texts of &s;cripture, than to the &s;criptures them|&s;elves fairly compared with each other. Can any chri&s;|tian deliberately judge, that what was nece&s;&s;ary to be known, to teach men GOD's will and our duty, in order for our happine&s;s here and glory hereafter, &s;hould be taught by the Holy Gho&s;t in &s;uch an unintelligible manner, as it were to the halves; and want hundreds of modern teach|ers to fini&s;h it. I think the entertaining of &s;uch a thought, would be an impeachment of the holy &s;criptures, and re|pugnant to rea&s;on it&s;elf. Let it be ob&s;erved, that I have not mentioned the confu&s;ion of opinions about election, or GOD's decreeative will, becau&s;e I would make light of it, or oppo&s;e the doctrine: GOD forbid. I fully believe what the &s;criptures &s;ay concerning it. I only oppo&s;e the &s;trange comments that many have made thereupon. It is plain,
<PB N="30" REF="034538_0029_0FFF23D3225E1498">I think, from &s;cripture, whoever makes election and pre|de&s;tination blanks in their creed, had as well renounce the Bible it&s;elf: For if there is no election there is no elect JE|SUS nor any grace. Therefore I will examine what the &s;criptures &s;ay concerning the main leading ideas that GOD has been plea&s;ed to reveal.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time I remember the word, elect, is mention|ed concerning redemption and &s;alvation, is in I&s;a. xlii. 1. <HI>Behold my &s;ervant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my &s;oul delighteth, &amp;c.</HI> Read to the tenth ver&s;e, and you will learn what GOD cho&s;e him for, and what he was to do.</P>
<P>Secondly, we read which way GOD cho&s;e to &s;ave &s;inners, viz. according to the election of grace, and not of works, read Rom. xi. 5, 6. You will find it more particularly explain|ed in Rom. ch. ix. where, under the types of E&s;au and Jacob, the Apo&s;tle illu&s;trates the difference of works and grace. Saying ver. 11, <HI>For the children being not yet born, neither hav|ing done any good or evil, that the purpo&s;e of GOD according to election might &s;tand.</HI> Mark what purpo&s;e, the purpo&s;e of &s;aving &s;inners. How? Not of works but of him that calleth, viz. the LORD JESUS, the wi&s;dom of the Father, who &s;aith, <HI>To you O men I call, &amp;c,</HI> Thus it appears GOD's choice in &s;aving &s;inners is in the way of grace, and not of works.</P>
<P>Thirdly, we read by what rule, viz. <HI>Elect, according to the fore-knowledge of GOD the Father, through &s;anctification of the &s;pirit unto obedience, &amp;c.</HI> And again, St. Paul informs us Rom. xi. 2. <HI>God hath not ca&s;t away his people which he fore-knew</HI>; but further te&s;tifies, Eph. i. 4. that his choice was exi&s;ting before the foundation of the world. And tells his Ephe&s;ian brethren, they had obtained their inheritance, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> tru&s;ted in CHRIST, being prede&s;tinated according <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the purpo&s;e of him who worketh all things according <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the council of his own will, &amp;c.

<P><PB N="31" REF="034538_0030_0FFF23FF281379C8">
Thus I under&s;tand GOD's intentional, decreeative will, is eternally and unalterably the &s;ame. And what can any &s;inner know re&s;pecting his per&s;onal election, by all that I have quoted, and by all the &s;criptures further &s;ay about it? It is evident he can know nothing in this way; neither did GOD mean he &s;hould. The way to know our per&s;onal e|lection, is to look into what GOD's preceptive will &s;ays. By GOD's preceptive will, I mean that part of GOD's will which is plainly and particularly revealed, by way of pro|clamation, commands, precepts, promi&s;es, and threatnings to men, as moral agents, and accountable beings. Which preceptive will, contains every e&s;&s;ential point, nece&s;&s;ary for us to know, in order to obtain &s;alvation, per&s;onally and in|dividually; or it would not properly be a revelation. For as GOD corre&s;ponds with man only by his con&s;cience, re&s;pecting his &s;alvation or damnation; &s;o the Apo&s;tles, bringing a divine revelation, &s;uitable to all capa&s;ities, did not addre&s;s mens pa&s;&s;ions by the in&s;inuating art of human rea&s;onings, or an artful chain of philo&s;ophic arguments; but they con&s;idered men as intelligent, moral agents; and declared GOD's preceptive will to every man's con&s;cience. They entered into no parley with mens rea&s;onings; but pre&s;&s;ing forward to their con&s;ciences, placed them before GOD, and conver&s;ed with them there. All the commands, precepts and in&s;titutions of the New-Te&s;tament, are direct|ed to con&s;ciences of men, as moral agents. There is no doubt but GOD can make any of his creatures whatever he plea&s;es, con&s;i&s;tent with his purpo&s;es. But as it has plea&s;|ed GOD to make men moral agents, they are thereby ac|countable for their conduct. But without the power of moral agency, they could not be obedient to GOD precep|tive will, nor di&s;obedient; and con&s;equently not accounta|ble for their actions, nor the &s;ubjects of rewards or puni&s;h|ments on the account of them. It is worthy to be ob&s;erv|ed, that GOD's decreeative will never ju&s;tifies nor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the con&s;cience of any &s;inner, as an ab&s;olute decree. If a mini&s;ter was to preach an hundred years, upon GOD's de|creeative will, it could not reach the con&s;cience of any &s;in|ner; &s;aid decrees being the &s;ame before creation exi&s;ted that they are now, and ever will be. Therefore the &s;urety aforc|named, to whom all power is committed, has revealed a part of his will and purpo&s;es, by way of commands, pre|cepts,
<PB N="32" REF="034538_0031_0FFF23D64041FAA0">promi&s;es and threatnings. And this part of his will re&s;pects the moral agency of rational beings; and in this view, GOD &s;ays come let us rea&s;on together. And altho the original creditor could not forgive the lea&s;t tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion of his law, nor admit of any repentance or reforma|tion of the rebel &s;inner; but annexes a cur&s;e upon the lea&s;t fault. JESUS CHRIST, the &s;urety, can forgive &s;ins, and ad|mit of repentance; if we are willing to receive him as pro|claimed in the go&s;pel. He te&s;tifies in his great commi&s;&s;ion, that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins can take place through his name; and has promi&s;ed for our encouragement, that he that believeth in him, &s;hall be &s;aved. But if any de&s;pi&s;e, di&s;believe, and make light of the go&s;pel, it is evident divine ju&s;tice does not now proceed again&s;t the &s;inner according to the covenant made with Adam (as it is called by many) but according to a new denunciation of wrath, under the Mediator's government, viz. <HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> Al&s;o, <HI>Who&s;oever loveth not our LORD JESUS CHRIST, let him be anathema, maranatha.</HI> Adam knew nothing of &s;uch a denunciation of wrath upon the footing he &s;tood in his innocency. St. Paul &s;ays, Tit. ii. II. <HI>The grace of GOD that bringeth &s;alvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that, denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;ober|ly, &amp;c.</HI> This is a great go&s;pel truth, and GOD's precepts expre&s;sly declare it to be his will, that all men, viz. who hear of this grace, &s;hould come to the knowledge of the truth, upon the footing of this go&s;pel grace, and be &s;aved; according as it is revealed in the New-Te&s;tament; this is GOD's preceptive will. Accordingly he commands all men every where to repent, Acts xvii. 30. I conceive that St. Paul, knowing when he wrote the &s;econd chapter of his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, that it was the expre&s;s com|mand and preceptive will of our Saviour, who is GOD, that the go&s;pel &s;hould be preached to all men, that they might come to the knowledge of the truth and be &s;aved; unle&s;s they &s;hould ob&s;tinately reject it; therefore, in this &s;en&s;e, the text under con&s;ideration, was properly expre&s;&s;ed. This is a &s;criptural ea&s;y and con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e, and perfect|ly agrees with the many texts that te&s;tify the eternal de|&s;truction of all, who in this life, reject the go&s;pel. This &s;en&s;e of the text agrees with the aforementioned unaltera|ble verdict, Mat. ch. xxv. This preceptive will of GOD
<PB N="33" REF="034538_0032_0FFF2400EA760690">can be, and has been broken, from the time that GOD wrote part of his will, with his own &s;inger on tables of &s;tone, Exod. ch. xxxi. until now. It was GOD's will that I&s;rael &s;hould not wor&s;hip idols; but how often did they commit idolatry.</P>
<P>The preceptive will of GOD, made known by the law, and all the prophets, as interpreted by our LORD JESUS, con&s;i&s;ts in loving GOD with all our heart, and our neigh|bour as our&s;elves. I need no more proof of the matter, than to a&s;k the con&s;ciences of every moral agent, under the light of the go&s;pel, whether they have not broken this will of GOD, viz. this law of love. To &s;um up a cloud of &s;crip|ture witne&s;&s;es, by one in&s;tance, I will quote Mat. xxiii. 37. <HI>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the Prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not, &amp;c.</HI> Here is the &s;ame word in the Greek, &s;ays a learned author, as in the text, 1 Tim. ii 4. tran&s;lated WILL; and in this pa&s;&s;age WOULD, and might have been rendered in our Engli&s;h language, <HI>How often have I willed together thy children, &amp;c.</HI> It is evi|dent in this text, CHRIST repre&s;ents him&s;elf as willing the &s;alvation of the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem; and it is equally evident they prevented his will taking effect, by their ob&s;ti|nate refu&s;al of his kindne&s;s. CHRIST had made full pro|vi&s;ion, in point of merit, for their &s;alvation; and publicly proclaimed his will, by an invitation for them to come, de|claring all things were ready for their refre&s;hment; and had they accepted it, they would have been &s;aved; but not|with&s;tanding this, they peri&s;hed becau&s;e they would not comply with his invitation. Thus it is evident the text, in 1 Tim. ii. 4. is &s;o &s;ar from affording the lea&s;t evidence of the actual &s;alvation of all men, that it exactly agrees with the united verdict of CHRIST and his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es, that numbers of the children of the kingdom, viz. the ob|&s;tinate Jews, were ca&s;t into outer darkne&s;s, &amp;c. And CHRIST te&s;tifies they never &s;hould ta&s;te of his &s;upper.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;hewed, that all the texts I have pervert|ed the &s;en&s;e of, in the &s;ample, will bear a &s;criptural mean|ing, with the verdict of CHRIST and his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es, re&s;pecting the everla&s;ting puni&s;hment (not of the works of iniquity) but of the workers of iniquity them&s;elves, in their
<PB N="34" REF="034538_0033_0FFF23D7CD468770">ri&s;en &s;ouls and bodies, at the day of judgment For want of con&s;idering the &s;criptural di&s;tinction, I have ob&s;erved between the intententional, decreeative part of GOD's will, and the preceptive part, as it re&s;pects moral agents, I con|ceive it is, that all the con&s;u&s;ion aforementioned hath taken place. In every in&s;tance, where the apo&s;tles &s;peak of per|&s;onal election, it was to them only, who, having believed the go&s;pel, made their per&s;onal election &s;ure; by keeping the faith and a good con&s;cience; or, as St. Peter expre&s;&s;eth it, 2 Pet. ch. i. &s;uch who give diligence, to add to their faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, godline&s;s, &amp;c. Such per&s;ons have the &s;pirit witne&s;&s;ing with their &s;pirit, that they are the elect children of GOD.</P>
<P>The knowledge of GOD's purpo&s;es being unchangeable, is of great &s;ervice to &s;uch, to &s;upport them under per&s;ecu|tions and trials; in this &s;en&s;e, the Apo&s;tles &s;peak of it to comfort and &s;trengthe the &s;aints. This &s;ecret of GOD is only with the righteous, Prov. iii. 32. they only can read their new name in the white &s;tone, which no man knoweth &s;aving he that receiveth it. The P&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;eth it full and clear, P&s;al. xxv. 14. <HI>The &s;ecret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and be will &s;heen them his covenant.</HI> They are &s;uch individuals, who can take comfort in the belief of GOD's unchangeable, decrecative will and purpo&s;es, claim|ing, through grace, their right in the exceeding great and precious promi&s;es; which may be &s;ummed up in the words of our LORD JESUS, John xiv. 19. <HI>Becau&s;e I live, ye &s;hall live al&s;o.</HI> And it was GOD's purpo&s;e to &s;ave every one, that ever was, or will be &s;aved, through the &s;anctification of the &s;pirit and the belief of the truth, 2 Thef. ch. ii. Accord|ingly, GOD calls them by the go&s;pel: And upon tru|ly believing the record GOD has given of his Son, any one may know his per&s;onal election: and GOD has revealed no other way for any &s;inner to have knowledge of it, any more than if there had not been one word written, that ever GOD had any ab&s;olute decrecative will, or not.</P>
<P>Therefore, it ought to be carefully ob&s;erved, whenev|er the &s;criptures &s;peak of GOD's decrees, as ordaining men per&s;onally to eternal happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery, they have always reference to them, under the characters, to which the pro|mi&s;es and threatnings are made, by GOD's preceptive will, For in&s;tance; GOD promi&s;es to ju&s;tify the believer, to par|don
<PB N="35" REF="034538_0034_0FFF2403468C48E8">the penitent, and will glorify the per&s;ervering &s;aint.&mdash; So he decreed from eternity, to ju&s;tify, pardon, and glori|fy &s;uch: And on the other hand, he as ab&s;olutely ordain|ed from eternity, that the finally unbelieving, impenitent, di&s;obedint &s;inner, as &s;uch, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with everla&s;t|ing de&s;truction, 2 Thef. i. 9. This &s;tate of the ca&s;e cannot be denied by any, without giving the lie to a con&s;iderable part of the New-Te&s;tament &s;criptures, which &s;peak of tho&s;e important points. This being a &s;criptural fact, I conceive it is pre&s;umptuous, and very daring, for any mortal to un|dertake to preach, or write his ideas re&s;pecting the decree|ative part of GOD's will, when he is at be&s;t a mere gue&s;&s;er; and by his my&s;tical rea&s;onings, to a&s;&s;ert many things which expre&s;sly contradict the preceptive part of GOD's will, which is plainly revealed by the word which &s;hall judge us at the la&s;t day, as &s;urely as CHRIST's te&s;timony is true, John xii. 48. <HI>The word that I have &s;poken, the &s;ame &s;hall judge him in the la&s;t day.</HI> Yea, boldly deny the expre&s;s te&s;timonies of CHRIST and his in&s;pired witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Where, Sir, do you get your commi&s;&s;ion and authority to proclaim to a world of &s;inners, the intentional, decreea|tive part of GOD's will, fir&s;t? when it is evident as words can expre&s;s it, that CHRIST commi&s;&s;ioned his Apo&s;tles to go and preach the preceptive part of his will to every crea|ture; fir&s;t witne&s;&s;ing to every man's con&s;cience, that if they believed their te&s;timony, they &s;hould be &s;aved; if not, they &s;hould be damned. They further te&s;tified, that the penal|ty fixed by CHRIST, the great &s;urety, aforenamed, for all &s;uch as did not repent and obey the go&s;pel, was everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the LORD.</P>
<P>I pray you to remember that the &s;criptures do not &s;ay, in one in&s;tance, that ever CHRIST repented for any &s;inner, or credited his own record for any, hoped or obeyed the go&s;pel for any &s;inner: The&s;e are acts of a moral agent, and as nece&s;&s;ary, in order to our per&s;onal knowledge of our election, as that the elect JESUS &s;hould atone the deity, to pre|pare a way for our return to GOD's favor.</P>
<P>He obeyed the law for &s;inners, it is true, but we mu&s;t credit it, each one for him&s;elf, in order to be per&s;onally ju&s;tified; and each one obey the go&s;pel, or peri&s;h; as &s;ure as the word which will judge us at the la&s;t day, is true.</P>
