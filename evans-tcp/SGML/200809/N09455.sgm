<HEAD>I. The Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no language, or form of words, &s;uf|ficiently copious and expre&s;&s;ive, though rai&s;ed to the utmo&s;t extent or height of de&s;cription, for repre&s;ent|ing the adorable manife&s;tations of heavenly kindne&s;s, goodne&s;s, conde&s;cen&s;ion and mercy, or for exhibiting the things which proceed from the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: but it is allowable to &s;peak whereof we know, according to the Mea&s;ure of knowledge, and to utter, according to the proportion of Strength given, what we now &s;ee in part, and what from experience we feel, of the merciful kindne&s;s of God; and which, as we faithfully follow his will, we &s;hall hereafter more fully and comprehen&s;ively behold.&mdash;This I apprehend is nece&s;&s;ary for all, to whom a revelation of the Chri|&s;tian Religion has been made by means of Holy Writ; and in an e&s;pecial manner, where He that is the di&s;co|verer of &s;tates, has opened their under&s;tandings to be|lieve the Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the &s;acred records of that miraculous Favour and Grace that came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="012046_0004_0F896F85F7A5E150">BUT for my own part, I mu&s;t freely acknowledge there was a time of my life, in which I would gladly have relieved my&s;elf from following the arduous paths of religion, by turning a&s;ide into the paths of Scep|tici&s;m and Infidelity. My mind was ready to alledge, as &s;ome at this time of day may be,
<Q>How can we believe without Evidence? There is not a &s;ufficient Evidence of Truth to convince my judgment, or to induce me to believe.</Q>
I know this has been the allegation of &s;ome: But I have found there is no Defi|ciency of evidence, but an unwillingne&s;s to admit the Force of that evidence, which would properly influ|ence the mind; and I have rea&s;on to apprehend this has been the ca&s;e with others: for if there was a tho|rough &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and di&s;po&s;ition of mind to receive the Truth in the Love of it; to endeavour after it in its genuine &s;implicity; to look at it with a &s;ingle eye; and, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, to &s;uppre&s;s or bani&s;h all the <HI>"buts</HI> and <HI>i&s;s;"</HI> we &s;hould &s;oon find the Evidence of the Chri&s;tian Religion to be lively and inconte&s;tible, and effectually to operate to make us wi&s;e and good; Wi&s;e with the Wi&s;dom that is to Sal|vation; and Good, with the Goodne&s;s that is of God, the Source of Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT whil&s;t people "take coun&s;el, and not of God," and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be
<Q>covered with a covering and not of his Spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxx. 1.</NOTE>,</Q>
they are unwilling to ad|mit the force of tho&s;e truths which would
<Q>&s;eparate the precious from the vile," and purify us accord|ing to his word.</Q>
&mdash;While this is the ca&s;e that many deviate in point of Faith, they may complain of the
<PB N="8" REF="012046_0005_0F896F86B7BD2A40">
want of Evidence, re&s;pecting the Certainty and Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and complain with as much ju&s;tice, as a man who wilfully hides him&s;elf in Dark|ne&s;s, complains of his Incapacity of Seeing. For we have <HI>&s;uch</HI> an evidence and under&s;tanding imparted by the Light and Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as doubtle&s;s abundantly di&s;plays the immediate Regard and Love of God, as recorded in Holy Writ; and from which I freely acknowledge an internal illumina|tion <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> for all that would have valid claim to the Chri&s;tian Religion; whereby we obtain a firm a&s;&s;ur|ance of, and a well-grounded belief in, tho&s;e glorious truths.</P>
<P>WE have &s;ometimes been accu&s;ed of allegorizing away the important truths of the Chri&s;tian Religion as recorded in Holy Writ: It is far, very far from our intention or inclination! We want to <HI>inforce</HI> them, upon our&s;elves, upon our brethren, with all that requi|&s;ite weight which commands their belief; calling to a belief of <HI>Heart,</HI> not a mere a&s;&s;ent with the Tongue; but "a belief of Heart unto righteou&s;ne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 10.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>WE have been di&s;tingui&s;hed, and are not a&s;hamed of the di&s;tinction, for preaching, "Chri&s;t within;" but we never preach a Chri&s;t within, oppo&s;ed to, or derogating from, a Chri&s;t <HI>without.</HI>&mdash;We fully be|lieve not only in his glorious and gracious appearance among&s;t the &s;ons of men, "as in the volume of the book it is written<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 7.</NOTE>;" but we al&s;o believe in his inward and &s;piritual appearance,
<Q>the &s;econd time with|out &s;in unto &s;alvation<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ix. 28.</NOTE>;</Q>
in which we are &s;upported by a cloud of witne&s;&s;es<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xii. 1.</NOTE>, and by the doctrine of the

holy Author of the Chri&s;tian Religion, inforcing his inward and &s;piritual manife&s;tation (the manife&s;tation of his Grace) in as clear and indubitable a manner, as from the te&s;timonies delivered concerning his external appearance.</P>
<P>BUT the my&s;tery of ungodline&s;s hath powerfully wrought with &s;ome who profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian name, in oppo&s;ition to the force of tho&s;e te&s;timonies with re|gard to his internal appearance, or manife&s;tation of him&s;elf in the hearts of mankind; and to render inad|mi&s;&s;ible the doctrine of an inward and &s;piritual com|munion, the revelation of Light, Life, and Good to the &s;ouls of men, immediately imparted for our redemp|tion and &s;anctification.&mdash;This would lead people home from the flowery paths of Ea&s;e and Speculation, into the arduous one of Practice: It would transfer re|ligion from the <HI>Head</HI> to the <HI>Heart;</HI> and, in its progre&s;s, would remove every ob&s;tacle to the admi&s;&s;ion of the doctrine of an inward and &s;piritual manife&s;tation of the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT there hath been a lamentable defection from the Life and Spirit of true chri&s;tianity, wherein the Old Man, under all the pomp of Opinion, and a&s;&s;ent|ing to indubitable Truths, &s;till remains in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of every inordinate love, and his goods are at ea&s;e. A mind di&s;gui&s;ed with JACOB'S Voice, and ESAU'S Hands, found orthodox Principles, with a &s;chi&s;matic Heart, ingro&s;s the Formali&s;t of all names and di&s;tincti|ons to religion; the old man being at ea&s;e with his goods, in a &s;tate of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, either rejoicing un|der a Form, and the fal&s;e &s;hade of Opinion and regu|larity of conduct, or in the pomp of a &s;pecious external

appearance; wherein &s;ome continue po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an un|happy tranquillity or ea&s;e of mind, and are endeavour|ing to build up a tabernacle quiet and &s;afe, content with a Form, or depending upon a bare Belief in the doctrines of the chri&s;tian religion.&mdash;But there is a work whereby the <HI>Old</HI> Earth, and the <HI>Old</HI> Heavens are made to <HI>&s;hake,</HI> and mu&s;t be removed; which is of the ador|able mercy and grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when he thus may reveal him&s;elf;&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>YET once more will I &s;hake not the Earth only, but al&s;o HEAVEN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 27.</NOTE>!</Q>
&mdash;Not only the Earth, not on|ly again&s;t the inhabitants of the earth; but the Work of God is made con&s;picuous in the Awakening of the ungodly, for their conver&s;ion from &s;in and death, unto righteou&s;ne&s;s and life.&mdash; "Yet once more will I &s;hake HEAVEN!"&mdash;The glorious &s;pecious Appearances of Truth, and Doctrines recorded and a&s;&s;ented to, but yet not reduced to Experience; truths received and confe&s;&s;ed by the Tongue, but the Heart revolting from their efficacious influence.</P>
<P><Q>Yet once more will I &s;hake not the Earth only, but al&s;o Heaven.</Q>
And this word, yet once <HI>more,</HI> &s;ignifies the REMOVING of tho&s;e things which are &s;haken.

The gracious effects of his powerful working, are manife&s;ted to bring us home from a &s;tate of fal&s;e dependence, that we may humbly and experientially acknowledge,

A &s;pecies of Deviation from the Power of Truth proceeding from the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which would &s;earch the &s;ecrets of every Heart! It would open to the view of the attentive mind their nature, and the &s;ituation they are in; what is of God,

and what is not of God; what is pure, and what is impure: It would ever prove a more deci&s;ive te&s;t in all our actions, a more certain criterion in our conduct through life, than it is to be feared the generality of Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors have attained, and which it is ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for the Strong Man armed to pro|duce, with all his &s;eeming Sanctity of the Fle&s;h, or &s;trenuous Support of Belief, and a multitude of exter|nal performances; notwith&s;tanding he may endeavour to plead for the "Law and the Commandment," and think thereby to attain the mark of Chri&s;t's followers, who "walk therein all the days of their lives."</P>
<P>BUT although they are thus lifted up in their minds, there is an Omni&s;cient and Omnipre&s;ent BEING, who cannot be deceived or impo&s;ed upon; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to invalidate that invariable obligation to live under the Power of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t however they may endeavour to find means, by profe&s;&s;ing his Name without taking up a Cro&s;s to the inordinate plea&s;ures and pur&s;uits of this world, or attribute to them&s;elves the merits of his death, without a death unto &s;in, and a new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, wherein alone we are made partakers of an everla&s;ting glory.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you by the mo&s;t powerful motive of the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that every one may endeavour to cultivate in your minds a living Sen&s;e of Religion; and that we may all experience the puri|ty and &s;anctity of its nature to operate in our hearts; and as members of one Family, tho' di&s;tingui&s;hed by various Names, we may continue as Brethren and Fel|low-pilgrims, in our pa&s;&s;age through the wilderne&s;s of this world, to an endle&s;s Glory; that we may run with

&mdash;It is this heavenly Love, the Love of God, that is the grand and &s;olemn cement of his fa|mily, both here and hereafter: wherein we are united to him, and in fellow&s;hip one with another. It binds all into an uniform con&s;i&s;tency, both in heaven and earth.&mdash;Many <HI>other</HI> objects of our love are local and temporary, limited to Time and Place, or confined to this world, and to the things that are in it: but the Love of GOD is an <HI>endle&s;s</HI> commandment.&mdash;It is CHARITY; that divine Charity, that will remain when te&s;timonies &s;hall cea&s;e, and declarations come to an end;&mdash;in a participation whereof we &s;hall &s;till continue to join in holy wor&s;hip and adoration unto God, the Author of our being.</P>

For, as I have hinted, while the BODY is terre&s;trial, the GLORY is terre&s;trial, until we are created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, unto righteou&s;ne&s;s; wherein our minds will become cloathed with a <HI>cele&s;tial</HI> glory, and by the power of Divine Grace, be &s;et above every earthly love.
