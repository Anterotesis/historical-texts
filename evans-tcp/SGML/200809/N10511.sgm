<P><HI>Now printing, and will &s;peedily be publi&s;hed by</HI> JAMES RIVINGTON, <HI>and</HI> HUGH GAINE, <HI>Book&s;ellers in New-York:</HI> LETTERS Written by the late Right Honourable PHILIP DORMER STANHOPE, Earl of CHESTERFIELD, to his Son, PHILIP STANHOPE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> late Envoy Extraordinary to the Court of DRESDEN: together with &s;everal other Pieces on various Subjects.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="testimonial">
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT By Mrs. EUGENIA STANHOPE, Mother of the Gentlemen to whom the&s;e Letters were wrote.</HEAD>
<P>THE death of the late Earl of Che&s;terfield is &s;o recent, his family, his Character, and his Talents &s;o well known, that it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to attempt any account of his Lord&s;hip's life. But, as the&s;e letters will pro|bably de&s;cend to po&s;terity, it may not be improper to explain the general &s;cope of them, and the rea&s;on that induced him to write on the &s;ubject of education.</P>
<P>It is well known that the late Earl of Che&s;terfield had a na|tural &s;on, whom he loved with the mo&s;t unbounded affection, and who&s;e Education was, for many years, the chief engage|ment of his life. After furni&s;hing him with the mo&s;t va|luable trea&s;ures of ancient and modern learning, to tho&s;e ac|qui&s;itions he was de&s;irous of adding that knowledge of men and things, which he him&s;elf had acquired by long and great experience. With this view were written the following let|ters; which, the reader will ob&s;erve, begin with tho&s;e dawn|ings of in&s;truction adapted to the capacity of a boy, and ri&s;ing gradually by precepts and monitions, calculated to direct and guard the age of incautious youth, fini&s;h with the advice and knowledge requi&s;ite to form the man, ambitious to &s;hine as an accompli&s;hed courtier, an orator in the &s;enate, or a mini&s;ter at foreign courts.</P>
<P>In order to effect the&s;e purpo&s;es, his Lord&s;hip, ever anxious to fix in his &s;on, a &s;crupulous adherence to the &s;tricte&s;t mora|lity, appears to have thought it the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t indi&s;pen|&s;able object&mdash;to lay, in the earlie&s;t period of life, a firm foun|dation in good principles and &s;ound religion. His next point
<PB N="2" REF="013324_0021_0F90F0E204393128">
was, to give him a perfect knowledge of the dead languages, and all the different branches of &s;olid learning, and by the &s;tudy of the be&s;t ancient authors; and al&s;o &s;uch a general idea of the &s;ciences as it is a di&s;grace to a gentleman, not to po&s;&s;e&s;s. The article of in&s;truction with which he concludes his &s;y&s;tem of education, and which he more particularly enforces through|out the whole work, is the &s;tudy of that u&s;eful and exten&s;ive &s;cience, the knowledge of mankind: in the cour&s;e of which, appears the nice&s;t inve&s;tigation of the human heart, and the &s;prings of human actions. From hence we find him induced to lay &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s on what are generally called accompli&s;h|ments, as mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite to fini&s;h the amiable and brilliant part of a compleat character.</P>
<P>It would be unnece&s;&s;ary to expatiate on the merits of &s;uch a work, executed by &s;o great a ma&s;ter. They cannot but be obvious to every per&s;on of &s;en&s;e; the more, as nothing of this &s;ort has (I believe) ever been produced in the Engli&s;h lan|guage. The candour of the public, to which the&s;e letters appeal, will determine the amu&s;ement and in&s;truction they afford. I flatter my&s;elf, they will be read with general &s;atis|faction; as the principal, and by far the greater part of them were written when the Earl of Che&s;terfield was in the full vi|gour of his mind, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e qualifications for which he was &s;o ju&s;tly admired in England, revered in Ire|land, and e&s;teemed wherever known.</P>
<P>Celebrated all over Europe for his &s;uperior talents as an epi&s;tolary writer, for the brilliancy of his wit, and the &s;oli|dity of his exten&s;ive knowledge, will it be thought too pre|&s;umptuous to a&s;&s;ert, that he exerted all tho&s;e faculties to the utmo&s;t, upon this favourite &s;ubject&mdash;education? And that, in order to form the mind of a darling &s;on, he even exhau&s;ted tho&s;e powers which he was &s;o univer&s;ally allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s?</P>
<P>I do not doubt but tho&s;e who were much connected with the author, during that &s;eries of years in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e wrote the following letters, will be ready to vouch the truth of the above a&s;&s;ertion. What I can, and do a&s;certain is, the authenticity of this publication; which compri&s;es not a &s;ingle line, that is not the late Earl of Che&s;terfield's.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may be of opinion, that the fir&s;t letters in this collection, intended for the in&s;truction of a child, then der &s;even years of age, were too trifling to merit publication. They are however in&s;erted by advice of &s;everal gentlemen of learning, and real judgment; who con&s;idered the whole as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to form a compleat &s;y&s;tem of education.

And, indeed, the reader will find his Lord&s;hip repeatedly telling his &s;on, that his affection for him makes him look upon no in&s;truction, which may be of &s;ervice to him, as too trifling or too low; I, therefore, did not think my&s;elf autho|ri&s;ed to &s;uppre&s;s what, to &s;o experienced a man, appeared re|qui&s;ite to the completion of his undertaking. And, upon this point, I may appeal more particularly to tho&s;e, who, be|ing fathers them&s;elves, know how to value in&s;tructions, of which their tenderne&s;s and anxiety for their children, will un|doubtedly make them feel the nece&s;&s;ity.

<P>To each of the French letters, throughout the work, an Engli&s;h tran&s;lation is annexed: in which I have endeavoured to adhere, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to the &s;en&s;e of the original: I wi&s;h the attempt may have proved &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e repetitions, which &s;ometimes occur, that many may e&s;teem inaccuracies, and think they had been better re|trenched: they are &s;o varied, and their &s;ignificancy thrown into &s;uch, and &s;o many different lights, that they could not be altered without mutilating the work.

<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT your age love of plea&s;ures is extremely natural, and the enjoyment of them not unbecoming; but the dan|ger at your age, is mi&s;taking the object, and &s;etting out wrong in the pur&s;uit. The character of a man of plea|&s;ure dazzles young eyes; they do not &s;ee their way to it di&s;|tinctly, and fall into vice and profligacy. I remember a &s;trong in&s;tance of this a great many years ago. A young fel|low determined to &s;hine as a man of plea&s;ure, was at the play called the LIBERTINE DESTROYED, a tran&s;lation of <HI>le Fe&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in de Pierre</HI> of Moliere's. He was &s;o &s;truck with what he thought the fine character of the libertine, that he &s;wore he would be the <HI>Libertine de&s;troyed.</HI> Some friends a&s;ked him, whether he had not better content him&s;elf with being only the libertine, but without being <HI>de&s;troyed?</HI> To which he an&s;wered with great warmth, "No; for that being de&s;troyed, was the per|fection of the whole." This, extravagant as it &s;eems in this light, is really the ca&s;e of many an unfortunate young fellow, who, captivated by the name of plea&s;ures, ru&s;hes indi&s;crimi|nately, and without ta&s;te, into them all, and is finally <HI>de|&s;troyed.</HI> I am not &s;toically advi&s;ing, nor par&s;onically preach|ing to you, to be a &s;toic at your age: far from it: I am pointing out to you the paths to plea&s;ure, and am endeavour|ing only to quicken and heighten them for you. Enjoy plea|&s;ures, but let them be your own, and then you will ta&s;te them; but adopt none: tru&s;t to nature for genuine ones. The plea&s;ures that you would feel, you mu&s;t earn; the man who gives him&s;elf up to all, feels none &s;en&s;ibly. Sardanapa|lus, I am convinced, never felt any in his life. Tho&s;e only who join &s;erious occupations with plea&s;ures, feel either as they &s;hould do. Alcibiades, though addicted to the mo&s;t &s;hame|ful exce&s;&s;es, gave &s;ome time to philo&s;ophy, and &s;ome to bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Julius Cae&s;ar joined bu&s;ine&s;s with plea&s;ure &s;o properly, that they naturally a&s;&s;i&s;ted each other and tho' he was the hu&s;band of all the wives at Rome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ound time to be one of the be&s;t &s;cholars, almo&s;t the be&s;t orator, and ab&s;olutely the be&s;t General there. An uninterrupted life of plea&s;ures is as in&s;ipid as contemptible. Some hours given every day to &s;e|rious bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t whet both the mind and the &s;en&s;es, to en|joy tho&s;e of plea&s;ure. A &s;urfeited glutton, an emaciated &s;ot, and an enervated rotten whore-ma&s;ter, never enjoy the plea|&s;ures to which they devote them&s;elves; but they are only &s;o many human &s;acrifices to fal&s;e Gods. The plea&s;ures of low-life are all of this mi&s;taken &s;pecies, merely &s;en&s;ual, and di&s;graceful to nature; whereas tho&s;e of high-life, and in good company,
<PB REF="013324_0025_0F904D7CE791F588">
(though po&s;&s;ibly in them&s;elves not more moral) are more de|licate, more refined, le&s;s dangerous, and le&s;s di&s;graceful; and, in the common cour&s;e of things, not reckoned di&s;grace|ful at all. In &s;hort, plea&s;ure mu&s;t not, nay cannot, be the bu|&s;ine&s;s of a man of &s;en&s;e and character; but it may be, and is, his relief, his reward. It is particularly &s;o with regard to women, who have the utmo&s;t contempt for tho&s;e men, that, having no character, nor con&s;ideration with their own &s;ex, fri|volou&s;ly pa&s;s their whole time in <HI>ruelles</HI> and at <HI>toiletts.</HI> They look upon them as their lumber, and remove them whenever they can get better furniture. Women chu&s;e their favourites more by the ear, than any other of their &s;en&s;es, or even their under&s;tandings. The man whom they hear the mo&s;t com|mended by the men, will always be the be&s;t received by them. Such a conque&s;t flatters their vanity, and vanity is their uni|ver&s;al, if not their &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion. A di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;hining character is irre&s;i&s;tible with them; they croud to, nay they even quarrel for the dangers, in hopes of the triumph. Tho' by the way (to u&s;e a vulgar expre&s;&s;ion) &s;he who conquers on|ly catches a tartar, and becomes the &s;lave of her captive. <HI>Mais e'e&s;t la leur affaire.</HI> Divide your time between u&s;eful occupations, and elegant plea&s;ures. The morning &s;eems to belong to &s;tudy, bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;erious conver&s;ations with men of learning and figure; not that I exclude an occa&s;ional hour at a <HI>toilette.</HI> From &s;itting down to dinner, the proper bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the day is plea&s;ure, unle&s;s real bu&s;ine&s;s, which mu&s;t never be po&s;tponed for plea&s;ure, happens accidentally to in|terfere. In good company, the plea&s;ures of the table are al|ways carried to a certain point of delicacy and gratification, but never to exce&s;s and riot. Plays, operas, balls, &s;uppers, gay conver&s;ations in polite and chearful companies, properly conclude the evenings; not to mention the tender looks that you may direct, and the &s;ighs that you may offer, upon the&s;e &s;e|veral occa&s;ions, to &s;ome propitious or unpropitious female deity; who&s;e character and manners will neither di&s;grace nor corrupt yours. This is the life of a man of real &s;en&s;e and plea&s;ure; and by this di&s;tribution of your time, and choice of your plea&s;ures, you will be equally qualified for the bu&s;y or the <HI>beau monde.</HI> You &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not rigid, and do not require that you and I &s;hould be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ame age. What I &s;ay to you, therefore, &s;hould have the more weight, as coming from a friend, not a father. But, low company, and their low vices, their indecent riots, and profligacy, I never will bear nor forgive.</P>
<P>I have lately received two volumes of treaties in German and Latin from Hawkins, with your orders, under your own hand, to take care of them for you, which orders I &s;hall mo&s;t dutifully and punctually obey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Pa&s;&s;age from Plymouth to Madeira, with &s;ome account of that I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING received my commi&s;&s;ion, which was dated the 25th of May 1768, I went on board on the 27th, hoi&s;ted the pennant, and took charge of the &s;hip, which then lay in the ba&s;on in Deptford Yard. She was fitted for &s;ea with all expedition; and &s;tores and provi&s;ions being taken on board, &s;ailed down the river on the 30th of July, and on the 13th of Augu&s;t anchored in Plymouth Sound.</P>
<P>While we lay here waiting for a wind, the articles of war and the act of parliament were read to the &s;hip's company, who were paid two months wages in advance, and told that they were to expect no additional pay for the performance of the voyage.</P>
<P>On Friday the 26th of Augu&s;t, the wind becoming fair, we got under &s;ail, and put to &s;ea. On the 31&s;t, we &s;aw &s;everal of the birds which the &s;ailors call Mother Carey's Chickens, and which they &s;uppo&s;e to be the forerunners of a &s;torm; and on the next day we had a very hard gale, which brought us under our cour&s;es, wa&s;hed over-board a &s;mall boat belonging to the Boat|&s;wain, and drowned three or four dozen of our poultry, which we regretted &s;till more.</P>
<P>On Friday the 2d of September we &s;aw land, between Cape Fini&s;ter and Cape Ortegal, on the coa&s;t of Gallicia, in Spain; and on the 5th, by an ob&s;ervation of the &s;un and moon, we found the latitude of Cape Fini&s;ter to be 42. 53. North, and its longitude 8. 46. We&s;t, our fir&s;t meridian being always &s;up|po&s;ed to pa&s;s through Greenwich; variation of the needle 21. 4. We&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="013324_0029_0F90F0E5B9A0EA18">
During this cour&s;e, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander had an op|portunity of ob&s;erving many marine animals, of which no na|turali&s;t has hitherto taken notice; particularly, a new &s;pecies of the <HI>Oni&s;cus,</HI> which was found adhering to the <HI>Medu&s;a Pelagica;</HI> and an animal of an angular figure, about three inches long and one thick, with a hollow pa&s;&s;ing quite through it, and a brown &s;pot on one end, which they conjectured might be its &s;tomach; four of the&s;e adhered together by their &s;ides when they were taken, &s;o that at fir&s;t they were thought to be one animal, but upon being put into a gla&s;s of water they &s;oon &s;eparated, and &s;wam about very bri&s;kly. The&s;e animals are of a new genus, to which Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander gave the name of <HI>Dagy&s;a,</HI> from the likene&s;s of one &s;pecies of them to a gem: &s;everal &s;pecimens of them were taken adhering together &s;ome|times to the length of a yard or more, and &s;hining in the water with very beautiful colours. Another animal of a new genus they al&s;o di&s;covered, which &s;hone in the water with colours &s;till more beautiful and vivid, and which indeed exceeded in variety and brightne&s;s any thing that we had ever &s;een: the colouring and &s;plendour of the&s;e animals were equal to tho&s;e of an Opal, and from their re&s;emblance to that gem, the genus was called <HI>Carcinium Opalinum.</HI> One of them lived &s;everal hours in a gla&s;s of &s;alt water, &s;wimming about with great agility, and at every motion di&s;playing a change of colours almo&s;t in|finitely various. We caught al&s;o among the rigging of the &s;hip, when we were at the di&s;tance of about ten leagues from Cape Fini&s;ter, &s;everal birds which have not been de&s;cribed by Linnaeus; they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have come from Spain, and our gentlemen called the &s;pecies <HI>Motacilla velificans,</HI> as they &s;aid none but &s;ailors would venture them&s;elves on board a &s;hip that was going round the world: one of them was &s;o exhau&s;ted that it died in Mr. Banks's hand, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it was brought to him.</P>
<P>It was thought extraordinary that no naturali&s;t had hitherto taken notice of the <HI>Dagy&s;a,</HI> as the &s;ea abounds with them not twenty leagues from the coa&s;t of Spain; but, unfortunately for, the cau&s;e of &s;cience, there are but very few of tho&s;e who traver&s;e the &s;ea, that are either di&s;po&s;ed or qualified to remark the curi|o&s;ities of which Nature has made it the repo&s;itory.</P>
<P>On the 12th we di&s;covered the i&s;lands of Porto Santo and Madeira, and on the next day anchored in Funchiale road, and moored with the &s;tream-anchor: but, in the night, the bend of the haw&s;er of the &s;tream-anchor &s;lipped, owing to the negli|gence of the per&s;on who had been employed to make it fa&s;t. In the morning the anchor was heaved up into the boat, and carried out to the &s;outhward; but in heaving it again, Mr. Weir, the ma&s;ter's mate, was carried overboard by the buoy-rope, and went to the bottom with the anchor: the people in the &s;hip &s;aw
<PB N="3" REF="013324_0030_0F90F0E674BBCD38">
the accident, and got the anchor up with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; it was however too late, the body came up intangled in the buoy-rope, but it was dead. When the i&s;land of Madeira is fir&s;t approached from the &s;ea, it has a very beautiful appearance; the &s;ides of the hills being intirely covered with vines almo&s;t as high as the eye can di&s;tingui&s;h, and the vines are green when every kind of herbage, except where they &s;hade the ground, and here and there by the &s;ides of a rill, is intirely burnt up, which was the ca&s;e at this time.</P>
<P>On the 13th, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, a boat, which our &s;ailors call the product boat, came on board from the officers of health, without who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion no per&s;on is &s;uffered to land from on board a &s;hip. As &s;oon as this permi&s;&s;ion was obtained, we went on &s;hore at Funchiale, the capital of the i&s;land, and proceeded directly to the hou&s;e of Mr. Cheap, who is the Engli&s;h con&s;ul there, and one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable merchants of the place. This gentleman received us with the kindne&s;s of a brother, and the liberality of a prince; he in&s;i&s;ted upon our taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;e, in which he furni&s;hed us with every po&s;&s;ible accommodation during our &s;tay upon the i&s;land; he procured leave for Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to &s;earch the i&s;land for &s;uch natural curio&s;ities as they &s;hould think worth their notice; employed per&s;ons to take fi&s;h and gather &s;hells, which time would not have permitted them to collect for them&s;elves; and he provided hor&s;es and guides to take them to any part of the country which they &s;hould chu&s;e to vi&s;it. With all the&s;e advantages, however, their excur&s;ions were &s;eldom pu&s;hed farther than three miles from the town, as they were only five days on &s;hore; one of which they &s;pent at home, in receiving the honour of a vi&s;it from the governor. The &s;ea&s;on was the wor&s;t in the year for their purpo&s;e, as it was neither that of plants nor in&s;ects; a few of the plants, however, were pro|cured in flower, by the kind attention of Dr. Heberden, the chief phy&s;ician of the i&s;land, and brother to Dr. Heberden of London, who al&s;o gave them &s;uch &s;pecimens as he had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and a copy of his Botanical Ob&s;ervations; con|taining, among other things, a particular de&s;cription of the trees of the i&s;land. Mr. Banks enquired after the wood which has been imported into England for cabinet work, and is here called Madeira mahogany: he learnt that no wood was exported from the i&s;land under that name, but he found a tree called by the natives Vigniatico, the <HI>Laurus indicus</HI> of Linnaeus, the wood of which cannot ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from mahogany. Dr. Heberden has a book-ca&s;e in which the vigniatico and mahogany are mixed, and they are no otherwi&s;e to be known from each other than by the colour, which, upon a nice examination, appears to be &s;omewhat le&s;s brown in the vigniatico than the mahogany; it is therefore in the highe&s;t degree probable, that
<PB N="4" REF="013324_0031_0F90F0E740324B00">
the wood known in England by the name of Madeira mahogany, is the vigniatico.</P>
<P>There is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that this whole i&s;land was, at &s;ome remote period, thrown up by the explo&s;ion of &s;ubter|raneous fire, as every &s;tone, whether whole or in fragments, that we &s;aw upon it appeared to have been burnt, and even the &s;and it&s;elf to be nothing more than a&s;hes: we did not, indeed, &s;ee much of the country, but the people informed us that what we did &s;ee was a very exact &s;pecimen of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The only article of trade in this i&s;land is wine, and the manner in which it is made is &s;o &s;imple, that it might have been u&s;ed by Noah, who is &s;aid to have planted the fir&s;t vine|yard after the flood: the grapes are put into a &s;quare wooden ve&s;&s;el, the dimen&s;ions of which are proportioned to the &s;ize of the vineyard to which it belongs; the &s;ervants then, having taken off their &s;tockings and jackets, get into it, and with their feet and elbows, pre&s;s out as much of the juice as they can: the &s;talks are afterwards collected, and being tied together with a rope, are put under a &s;quare piece of wood, which is pre&s;&s;ed down upon them by a lever with a &s;tone tied to the end of it. The inhabitants have made &s;o little improvement in knowledge or art, that they have but very lately brought all the fruit of a vineyard to be of one fort, by engrafting their vines: there &s;eems to be in mind as there is in matter, a kind of <HI>vis inertiae,</HI> which re&s;i&s;ts the fir&s;t impul&s;e to change. He who propo&s;es to a&s;&s;i&s;t the artificer or the hu&s;bandman by a new application of the principles of philo&s;ophy, or the powers of mechani&s;m, will find, that his having hitherto done without them, will be a &s;tronger motive for continuing to do without them &s;till, than any advantage, however manife&s;t and con&s;iderable, for adopt|ing the improvement. Wherever there is ignorance there is prejudice; and the common people of all nations are, with re|&s;pect to improvements, like the pari&s;h poor of England with re&s;pect to a maintenance, for whom the law mu&s;t not only make a provi&s;ion, but compel them to accept it, or el&s;e they will be &s;till found begging in the &s;treets. It was therefore with great difficulty that the people of Madeira were per&s;uaded to engraft their vines, and &s;ome of them &s;till ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to adopt the practice, though a whole vintage is very often &s;poiled by the number of bad grapes which are mixed in the vat, and which they will not throw out, becau&s;e they increa&s;e the quan|tity of the wine: an in&s;tance of the force of habit, which is the more extraordinary, as they have adopted the practice of en|grafting with re&s;pect to their che&s;nut-trees, an object of much le&s;s importance, which, however, are thus brought to bear &s;ooner than they would otherwi&s;e have done.</P>
<P>We &s;aw no wheel-carriages of any &s;ort in the place, which perhaps is not more owing to the want of ingenuity to invent

them, than to the want of indu&s;try to mend the roads, which at pre&s;ent, it is impo&s;&s;ible that any wheel-carriages &s;hould pa&s;s: the inhabitants have hor&s;es and mules indeed, excellently adapted to &s;uch ways; but their wine is, notwith&s;tanding, brought to town from the vineyards where it is made, in ve&s;&s;els of goat-&s;kins, which are carried by men upon their heads. The only imitation of a carriage among the&s;e people is a board, made &s;omewhat hollow in the middle, to one end of which a pole is tied, by a &s;trap of whitleather: this wretched &s;ledge approaches about as near to an Engli&s;h cart, as an Indian canoe to a &s;hip's long-boat; and even this would probably never have been thought of, if the Engli&s;h had not introduced wine ve&s;&s;els which are too big to be carried by hand, and which, therefore, are dragged about the town upon the&s;e machines.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on, perhaps, why art and indu&s;try have done &s;o little for Madeira is, Nature's having done &s;o much. The &s;oil is very rich, and there is &s;uch a difference of climate between the plains and the hills, that there is &s;carcely a &s;ingle object of luxury that grows either in Europe or the Indies, that might not be produced here. When we went to vi&s;it Dr. Heberden, who lives upon a con&s;iderable a&s;cent, about two miles from town, we left the thermometer at 74, and when we arrived at his hou&s;e, we found it at 66. The hills produce, almo&s;t &s;pon|taneou&s;ly, walnuts, che&s;nuts, and apples in great abundance; and in the town there are many plants which are the natives both of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, particularly the banana, the guava, the pine-apple or anana, and the mango, which flouri&s;h almo&s;t without culture. The corn of this country is of a mo&s;t excellent quality, large grained and very fine, and the i&s;land would produce it in great plenty; yet mo&s;t of what is con&s;umed by the inhabitants is imported. The mutton, pork, and beef are al&s;o very good; the beef in particular, which we took on board here, was univer&s;ally allowed to be &s;carcely inferior to our own; the lean part was very like it, both in colour and grain, though the bea&s;ts are much &s;maller, but the &s;at is as white as the fat of mutton.</P>
<P>The town of Funchiale derives its name from <HI>Funcho,</HI> the Portugue&s;e name for fennel, which grows in great plenty upon the neighbouring rocks, and, by the ob&s;ervation of Dr. Heber|den, lies in latitude of 32. 33, 33.

the convents are in a better ta&s;te, e&s;pecially that of the Franci&s;|cans, which is plain, &s;imple, and neat in the highe&s;t degree. The infirmary in particular drew our attention as a model which might be adopted in other countries with great advantage. It con&s;i&s;ts of a long room, on one &s;ide of which are the windows, and an altar for the convenience of admini&s;tering the &s;acrament to the &s;ick: the other &s;ide is divided into wards, each of which is ju&s;t big enough to contain a bed, and neatly lined with gally-tiles; behind the&s;e wards, and parallel to the room in which they &s;tand, there runs a long gallery, with which each ward com|municates by a door, &s;o that the &s;ick may be &s;eparately &s;upplied with whatever they want without di&s;turbing their neighbours. In this convent there is al&s;o a &s;ingular curio&s;ity of another kind; a &s;mall chapel, the whole lining of which, both &s;ides and ceil|ing, is compo&s;ed of human &s;culls and thigh bones; the thigh bones are laid acro&s;s each other, and a &s;cull is placed in each of the four angles. Among the &s;culls one is very remarkable; the upper and the lower jaw, on one &s;ide, perfectly and firmly cohere; how the o&s;&s;ification which unites them was formed, it is not perhaps very ea&s;y to conceive, but it is certain that the patient mu&s;t have lived &s;ome time without opening his mouth: what nouri&s;hment he received was conveyed through a hole which we di&s;covered to have been made on the other &s;ide, by forcing out &s;ome of the teeth, in doing which the jaw al&s;o &s;eems to have been injured. We vi&s;ited the good Fathers of this con|vent on a Thur&s;day evening, ju&s;t before &s;upper-time, and they received us with great politene&s;s; <Q>We will not a&s;k you, &s;aid they, to &s;up with us, becau&s;e we are not prepared, but if you will come to-morrow, though it is a fa&s;t with us, we will have a turkey roa&s;ted for you.</Q> This invitation, which &s;hewed a liberality of &s;entiment not to have been expected in a convent of Portugue&s;e Friars at this place, gratified us much, though it was not in our power to accept it. We vi&s;ited al&s;o a convent of nuns, dedicated to <HI>Santa Clara,</HI> and the Ladies did as the honour to expre&s;s a particular plea&s;ure in &s;eeing us there: they had heard that there were great philo&s;ophers among us, and not at all knowing what were the objects of philo&s;ophical knowledge, they a&s;ked us &s;everal que&s;tions that were ab&s;urd and extravagant in the highe&s;t degree; one was, when it would thunder; and another, whether a &s;pring of fre&s;h water was to be found any where within the walls of their convent, of which it &s;eems they were in great want. It will naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed that our an&s;wers to &s;uch que&s;tions were neither &s;atisfactory to the Ladies, nor, in their e&s;timation, honourable to us; yet their di&s;appointment did not in the lea&s;t le&s;&s;en their civility, and they talked, without cea&s;ing, during the whole of our vi&s;it, which la&s;ted about half an hour.</P>

Ruivo, ri&s;es 5,068 feet, near an Engli&s;h mile, perpendicularly from its ba&s;e, which is much higher than any land that has been mea&s;ured in Great Britain. The &s;ides of the&s;e hills are covered with vines to a certain height, above which there are woods of che&s;nut and pine of immen&s;e extent, and above them fore&s;ts of wild timber of various kinds not known in Europe; particularly two, called by the Portugue&s;e <HI>Mirmulano</HI> and <HI>Pao|branco,</HI> the leaves of both which, particularly the <HI>Paobranco,</HI> are &s;o beautiful, that the&s;e trees would be a great ornament to the gardens of Europe.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in this i&s;land is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about 80,000, and the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e duties produce a revenue to the king of Portugal of 20,000 pounds a year, clear of all expences, which might ea&s;ily be doubled by the product of the i&s;land, exclu&s;ive of the vines, if advantage was taken of the excellence of the climate, and the amazing fertility of the &s;oil; but this object is utterly neglected by the Portugue&s;e. In the trade of the inhabitants of Madeira with Li&s;bon the balance is again&s;t them, &s;o that all the Portugue&s;e money naturally going thither, the currency of the i&s;land is Spani&s;h; there are indeed a few Portugue&s;e pieces of copper, but they are &s;o &s;carce that we did not &s;ee one of them: the Spani&s;h coin is of three deno|minations; Pi&s;tereens, worth about a &s;hilling; Bitts, worth about &s;ix pence; and Half-bitts, three pence.</P>
<P>The tides at this place flow at the full and change of the moon, north and &s;outh; the &s;pring tides ri&s;e &s;even feet per|pendicular, and the neap tides four. By Dr. Heberden's ob|&s;ervation, the variation of the compa&s;s here is now 15. 30. We&s;t, and decrea&s;ing; but I have &s;ome doubt whether he is not mi&s;taken with re&s;pect to its decrea&s;e: we found that the North point of the dipping needle belonging to the Royal Society dipped 77. 18.</P>
<P>The refre&s;hments to be had here, are water, wine, fruit of &s;everal &s;orts, onions in plenty, and &s;ome &s;weetmeats; fre&s;h meat and poultry are not to be had without leave from the go|vernor, and the payment of a very high price. We took in 270 lb. of fre&s;h beef, and a live bullock, charged at 613 lb. 3,032 gallons of water, and ten tuns of wine; and in the night, between Sunday the 18th and Monday the 19th of September, we &s;et &s;ail in pro&s;ecution of our voyage.</P>

of the&s;e bore S. &frac12; W. at the di&s;tance of about 5 leagues we found the variation of the compa&s;s by azimuth to be 17:50. I make the&s;e i&s;lands to lie in latitude 30:11. North, and di&s;tant 58 leagues from Funchiale in Madeira, in the direction of S. 16 Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On Friday the 23d we &s;aw the Peak of Teneriffe bearing W. by S. &frac12; S. and found the variation of the compa&s;s to be from 17:22, to 16:30. The height of this mountain, from which I took a new departure, has been determined by Dr. Heberden, who has been upon it, to be 15, 396 feet, which is but 148 yards le&s;s than three miles, reckoning the mile at 1760 yards. Its appearance at &s;un&s;et was very &s;triking; when the &s;un was below the horizon, and the re&s;t of the i&s;land appeared of a deep black, the mountain &s;till reflected his rays, and glowed with a warmth of colour which no painting can expre&s;s. There is no eruption of vi&s;ible fire from it, but a heat i&s;&s;ues from the chinks near the top, too &s;trong to be borne by the hand when it is held near them. We had received from Dr. Heberden, among other favours, &s;ome &s;alt which he collected on the top of the mountain, where it is found in large quantities, and which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the true <HI>natrum</HI> or <HI>nitrum</HI> of the ancients: he gave us al&s;o &s;ome native &s;ulphur exceedingly pure, which he had likewi&s;e found upon the &s;urface in great plenty. On the next day, Saturday the 24th, we came into the north-ea&s;t trade wind, and on Friday the 30th &s;aw Bona Vi&s;ta, one of the Cape de Verd I&s;lands; we ranged the ea&s;t &s;ide of it, at the di&s;tance of three or four miles from the &s;hore, till we were obliged to haul off to avoid a ledge of rocks which &s;tretch out S. W. by W. from the body, or S. E. point of the i&s;land, to the extent of a league and a half. Bona Vi&s;ta by our ob&s;ervation lies in lati|tude 16 N. and longitude 21:51 We&s;t.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of October, in latitude 14:6 N. and longitude 22:10 W. we found the variation by a very good azimuth to be 10:37 W. and the next morning it appeared to be 10,. This day we found the &s;hip five miles a-head of the log, and the next day &s;even. On the third, hoi&s;ted out the boat to di&s;|cover whether there was a current, and found one to the ea&s;t|ward, at the rate of three quarters of a mile an hour.</P>
<P>During our cour&s;e from Teneriffe to Bona Vi&s;ta we &s;aw great numbers of flying fi&s;h, which from the cabbin windows appear beautiful beyond imagination, their &s;ides having the colour and brightne&s;s of burni&s;hed &s;ilver; when they are &s;een from the deck they do not appear to &s;o much advantage, becau&s;e their backs are of a dark colour. We al&s;o took a Shark, which proved to be the <HI>Squalus Charcharias</HI> of Linnaeus.</P>
<P>Having lo&s;t the trade wind on the third, in latitude 12:14, and longitude 22:10., the wind became &s;omewhat variable, and we had light airs and calms by turns.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013324_0036_0F90F0EAE3A83838">
On the &s;eventh, Mr. Banks went out in the boat and took what the &s;eaman call a Portugue&s;e man of war; it is the <HI>Holo|thuria Phy&s;alis</HI> of Linnaeus, and a &s;pecies of the <HI>Mollu&s;ca.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;mall bladder about &s;even inches long, very much re&s;embling the air-bladder of fi&s;hes, from the bottom of which de&s;cended a number of &s;trings, of a bright blue and red; &s;ome of them three or four feet in length, which upon being touched &s;ting like a nettle, but with much more force. On the top of the bladder is a membrane which is u&s;ed as a &s;ail, and turned &s;o as to receive the wind which way &s;oever it blows: this mem|brane is marked in fine pink coloured veins, and the animal is in every re&s;pect an object exqui&s;itely curious and beautiful.</P>
<P>We al&s;o took &s;everal of the &s;hell-fi&s;hes, or te&s;taceous animals, which are always found floating upon the water, particularly the <HI>Helix Janthina</HI> and <HI>Violacea;</HI> they are about the &s;ize of a &s;nail, and are &s;upported upon the &s;urface of the water by a &s;mall clu&s;ter of bubbles, which are filled with air and con&s;i&s;t of a tenaceous &s;limly &s;ub&s;tance that will not ea&s;ily part with its contents; the animal is oviparous, and the&s;e bubbles &s;erve al&s;o as a <HI>nidus</HI> for its eggs. It is probable that it never goes down to the bottom, nor willingly approaches any &s;hore; for the &s;hell is exceedingly brittle, and that of few fre&s;h water &s;nails is &s;o thin: every &s;hell contains about a tea-&s;poonful of liquor, which it ea&s;ily di&s;charges upon being touched, and which is of the mo&s;t beautiful red purple that can be conceived. It dies linen cloth, and it may perhaps be worth enquiry, as the &s;hell is certainly found in the Mediterranean, whether it be not the <HI>Purpura</HI> of the ancients.</P>
<P>On the 8th, in latitude 8:25. North, longitude 22:4. W., we found a current &s;etting to the &s;outhward, which the next day in latitude 7:58. longitude 22:13, &s;hifted to the N. N. W. &frac34; W. at the rate of one mile and a furlong an hour. The variation here, by the mean of &s;everal azimuths, appeared to be 8:39. We&s;t.</P>
<P>On the tenth, Mr. Banks &s;hot the black-toed gull, not yet de&s;cribed according to Linnaeus's &s;y&s;tem; he gave it the name of <HI>Larus erepidatus:</HI> it is remarkable that the dung of this bird is of a lively red, &s;omewhat like that of the liquor procured from the &s;hells, only not &s;o full; its principal food therefore is probably the <HI>Helix</HI> ju&s;t mentioned. A current to the N. W. prevailed more or le&s;s till Monday the 24th, when we were in latitude 1:7. N. and longitude 28:50.</P>
<P>On the 25th, we cro&s;&s;ed the line with the u&s;ual ceremonies in longitude 29:30., when by the re&s;ult of &s;everal very good azimuths, the variation was 2:24.</P>
<P>On the 28th, at noon, being in the latitude of Ferdinand <HI>Noronha,</HI> and, by the mean of &s;everal ob&s;ervations by Mr. Green and my&s;elf, in longitude 32:5. 16. W., which is to the we&s;t|ward

of it by &s;ome charts, and to the ea&s;tward by others, we expected to &s;ee the i&s;land, or &s;ome of the &s;hoals that are laid down in the charts between it and the main, but we &s;aw neither one nor the other.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 29th, we ob&s;erved that luminous ap|pearance of the &s;ea which has been &s;o often mentioned by navi|gators, and of which &s;uch various cau&s;es have been a&s;&s;igned; &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ing it to be occa&s;ioned by fi&s;h, which agitated the water by darting at their prey, &s;ome by the putrefaction of fi&s;h and other marine animals, &s;ome by electricity, and others re|ferring it into a great variety of different cau&s;es. It appeared to emit fla&s;hes of light exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e of lightning, only not &s;o con&s;iderable, but they were &s;o frequent that &s;ome|times eight or ten were vi&s;ible almo&s;t at the &s;ame moment. We were of opinion that they proceeded from &s;ome luminous animal, and upon throwing out the ca&s;ting net our opinion was con|firmed: it brought up a &s;pecies of the <HI>Medu&s;a,</HI> which when it came on board had the appearance of metal violently heated, and emitted a white light: with the&s;e animals were taken &s;ome very &s;mall crabs, of three different &s;pecies, each of which gave as much light as a glow-worm, though the creature was not &s;o large by nine tenths: upon examination of the&s;e animals Mr. Banks had the &s;atisfaction to find that they were all entirely new.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 2d of November, about noon, being in the latitude of 10:38. S. and longitude 32:13. 43 W., we pa&s;&s;ed the line in which the needle at this time would have pointed due north and &s;outh, without any variation: for in the morning, having decrea&s;ed gradually in its deviation for &s;ome days, it was no more than 18 W. and in the afternoon it was 34 Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 6th, being in latitude 19:3 South, longitude 35:50 We&s;t, the colour of the water was ob&s;erved to change, upon which we founded, and found ground at the depth of 32 fathoms; the lead was ca&s;t three times within about four hours, without a foot difference in the depth or quality of the bottom, which was coral rock, fine &s;and, and &s;hells; we therefore &s;uppo&s;ed that we had pa&s;&s;ed over the tail of the great &s;hoal which is laid down in all our charts by the name of <HI>Abrothos,</HI> on which Lord An&s;on &s;truck &s;oundings in his pa&s;&s;age outwards: at four the next morning we had no ground with 100 fathom.</P>
<P>As &s;everal articles of our &s;tock and provi&s;ions now began to fall &s;hort, I determined to put into Rio de Janeiro, rather than at any port in Brazil or Falkland's I&s;lands, knowing that it could better &s;upply us with what we wanted, and making no doubt but that we &s;hould be well received.</P>
<P>On the 8th, at day-break, we &s;aw the coa&s;t of Brazil, and about ten o'clock we brought to, and &s;poke with a fi&s;hing-boat; the people on board told us that the land which we &s;aw, lay to
<PB N="11" REF="013324_0038_0F90F0EBB22D7198">
the &s;outhward of <HI>Sancto E&s;pirito,</HI> but belonged to the captain-&s;hip of that place.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on board this ve&s;&s;el, in which they found eleven men, nine of whom were Blacks; they all fi&s;hed with lines, and their fre&s;h cargo, the chief part of which Mr. Banks bought, con&s;i&s;ted of dolphins, large pelagic &s;combers of two kinds, &s;ea bream, and &s;ome of the fi&s;h which in the We&s;t Indies are called Wel&s;hmen. Mr. Banks had taken Spani&s;h &s;ilver with him, which he imagined to be the currency of the continent, but to his great &s;urprize the people a&s;ked him for Engli&s;h &s;hillings; he gave them two which he happened to have about him, and it was not without &s;ome di&s;pute that they took the re&s;t of the money in pi&s;tereens. Their bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed to be to catch large fi&s;h at a good di&s;tance from the &s;hore, which they &s;alted in bulk, in a place made for that purpo&s;e in the middle of their boat: of this merchandize they had about two quintals on board, which they offered for about 16 &s;hillings, and would probably have &s;old for half the money. The fre&s;h fi&s;h, which was bought for about nineteen &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, &s;erved the whole &s;hip's company; the &s;alt was not wanted. The &s;ea provi&s;ion of the&s;e fi&s;hermen con&s;i&s;ted of nothing more than a ca&s;k of water, and a bag of Ca&s;&s;ada flour, which they called <HI>Farinha de Pao,</HI> or wooden flour, which indeed is a name which very well &s;uits its ta&s;te and appearance. Their water ca&s;k was large, as wide as their boat, and exactly fitted a place that was made for it in the balla&s;t; it was impo&s;&s;ible therefore to draw out any of its contents by a tap, the &s;ides being, from the bottom to the top, wholly inacce&s;&s;ible; neither could any be taken out by dipping a ve&s;&s;el in at the head, for an opening &s;ufficiently wide for that purpo&s;e would have endang|ered the lo&s;s of great part of it by the rolling of the ve&s;&s;el: their expedient to get at their water, &s;o &s;ituated, was curious; when one of them wanted to drink, he applied to his neighbour, who accompanied him to the water ca&s;k with a hollow cane about three feet long, which was open at both ends; this he thru&s;t into the ca&s;k through a &s;mall hole in the top, and then &s;topp|ing the upper end with the palm of his hand, drew it out; the pre&s;&s;ure of the air again&s;t the other end keeping in the water which it contained; to this end the per&s;on who wanted to drink applied his mouth, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tant then taking his hand from the other, and admitting the air above, the cane immediately parted with its contents, which the drinker drew off till he was &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>We &s;tood off and on along the &s;hore till the 12th, and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively &s;aw a remarkable hill near Santo E&s;pirito, then Cape St. Thomas, and then an i&s;land ju&s;t without Cape Trio, which in &s;ome maps is called the i&s;land of Trio, and which being high, with a hollow in the middle, has the appearance of two i&s;lands

when &s;een at a di&s;tance. On this day we &s;tood along the &s;hore for Rio de Janeiro, and at nine the next morning made &s;ail for the harbour. I then &s;ent Mr. Hicks, my fir&s;t Lieutenant, before us in the pinnace, up to the city, to acquaint the Governor, that we put in there to procure water and refre&s;hments; and to de&s;ire the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a pilot to bring us into proper anchoring ground. I continued to &s;tand up the river, tru&s;ting to Mr. Belli&s;le's draught, publi&s;hed in the <HI>Petit Atlas maritime,</HI> Vol. II. No. 54, which we found very good, till five o'clock in the evening, expecting the return of my Lieutenant; and ju&s;t as I was about to anchor, above the i&s;land of Cobras, which lies before the city, the pinnace came back without him, having on board a Portugue&s;e officer, but no pilot. The people in the boat told me, that my Lieutenant was detained by the Viceroy till I &s;hould go on &s;hore. We came immediately to an anchor; and, almo&s;t at the &s;ame time, a ten oared boat, full of &s;oldiers, came up and kept rowing round the &s;hip, without exchanging a word: in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, another boat came on board with &s;everal of the Viceroy's officers, who a&s;ked, Whence we came; what was our cargo; the number of men and guns on board; the object of our voyage, and &s;everal other que&s;tions, which we directly and truly an&s;wered: they then told me, as a kind of apology for detaining my Lieutenant, and putting an officer on board my pinnace, that it was the invaria|ble cu&s;tom of the place, to detain the fir&s;t officer who came on &s;hore from any &s;hip on her arrival, till a boat from the Viceroy had vi&s;ited her, and to &s;uffer no boat to go either from or to a &s;hip, while &s;he lay there, without having a &s;oldier on board. They &s;aid that I might go on &s;hore when I plea&s;ed; but wi&s;hed that every other per&s;on might remain on board till the paper which they &s;hould draw up had been delivered to the Viceroy, promi&s;ing that, immediately upon their return the Lieutenant &s;hould be &s;ent on board.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e was performed; and, on the next morning, the 14th, I went on &s;hore, and obtained leave of the Viceroy to purcha&s;e provi&s;ions and refre&s;hments for the &s;hip, provided I would employ one of their own people as a factor, but not other|wi&s;e. I made &s;ome objections to this, but he in&s;i&s;ted upon it as the cu&s;tom of the place. I objected al&s;o again&s;t the putting a &s;oldier into the boat every time &s;he went between the &s;hip and the &s;hore; but he told me, that this was done by the expre&s;s orders of his court, with which he could in no ca&s;e di&s;pen&s;e. I then reque&s;ted, that the Gentlemen whom I had on board might re&s;ide on &s;hore during our &s;tay, and that Mr. Banks might go up the country to gather plants; but this he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed. I judged from his extreme caution, and the &s;everity of the&s;e re|&s;trictions, that he &s;u&s;pected we were come to trade; I therefore took &s;ome pains to convince him to the contrary. I told him,
<PB N="13" REF="013324_0040_0F90F0F2B8F07638">
that we were bound to the &s;outhward, by the order of his Bri|tannic Maje&s;ty, to ob&s;erve a tran&s;it of the planet Venus over the Sun, an a&s;tronomical phaenomenon of great importance to navigation. Of the tran&s;it of Venus, however, he could form no other conceptio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, than that it was the pa&s;&s;ing of the North Star through the South Pole; for the&s;e are the very words of his interpreter, who was a Swede, and &s;poke Engli&s;h very well. I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion of the Gentlemen to come on &s;hore during the day, or that, when I was on &s;hore my&s;elf, I might be at liberty, taking for granted that nothing was intended to the contrary; but in this I was unfortunately mi&s;taken. As &s;oon as I took leave of his Excellency, I found an officer who had orders to attend me wherever I went: of this I de&s;ired an explanation, and was told that it was meant as a compliment; I earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from accepting &s;uch an honour, but the good Viceroy would by no means &s;uffer it to be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>With this officer, therefore, I returned on board, about twelve o'clock, where I was impatiently expected by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who made no doubt but that a fair account of us having been given by the officers who had been on board the evening before, in their paper called a <HI>Practica,</HI> and every &s;cruple of the Viceroy removed in my conference with his Excellency, they &s;hould immediately be at liberty to go on &s;hore, and di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves as they plea&s;ed. Their di&s;ap|pointment at receiving my report may ea&s;ily be conceived; and it was &s;till increa&s;ed by an account, that it had been re&s;olved, not only to prevent their re&s;iding on &s;hore, and going up the country, but even their leaving the &s;hip; orders having been given, that no per&s;on except the Captain, and &s;uch common &s;ailors as were required to be upon duty, &s;hould be permitted to land; and that there was probably a particular view to the pa&s;&s;engers in this prohibition, as they were reported to be Gentlemen &s;ent abroad to make ob&s;ervations and di&s;coveries, and were uncommonly qualified for that purpo&s;e. In the even|ing, however, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and attempted to go on &s;hore, in order to make a vi&s;it to the Viceroy; but they were &s;topped by the guard-boat which had come off with our pinnace, and which kept hovering round the &s;hip all the while &s;he lay here, for that purpo&s;e; the officer on board &s;aying, that he had particular orders, which he could not di&s;obey, to &s;uffer no pa&s;&s;enger, or any officer, except the Cap|tain, to pa&s;s the boat. After much expo&s;tulation to no purpo&s;e, they were obliged, with whatever reluctance and mortification, to return on board. I then went on &s;hore my&s;elf, but found the Viceroy inflexible; he had one an&s;wer ready for every thing I could &s;ay, That the re&s;trictions under which he had laid us,
<PB N="14" REF="013324_0041_0F90F0F4361AD098">
were in obedience to the King of Portugal's commands, and therefore indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation I determined, rather than be made a pri|&s;oner in my own boat, to go on &s;hore no more; for the officer who, under pretence of a compliment, attended me when I was a&s;hore, in&s;i&s;ted al&s;o upon going with me to and from the &s;hip: but &s;till imagining, that the &s;crupulous vigilance of the Viceroy mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome mi&s;taken notion about us, which might more ea&s;ily be remove by writing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in conver&s;ation, I drew up a memorial, and Mr. Banks drew up another, which we &s;ent on &s;hore. The&s;e memorials were both an&s;wered, but by no means to our &s;atisfaction; we therefore replied: in con&s;e|quence of which &s;everal other papers were interchanged between us and the Viceroy, but &s;till without effect. However, as I thought &s;ome degree of force, on the part of the Viceroy, to enforce the&s;e re&s;trictions, nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify my acquie&s;cence in them to the Admiralty; I gave orders to my Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, when I &s;ent him with our la&s;t reply on Sunday the 20th, in the evening, not to &s;uffer a guard to be put into his boat. When the officer on board the guard-boat found that Mr. Hicks was determined to obey my orders, he did not pro|ceed to force, but attended him to the landing-place, and re|ported the matter to the Viceroy. Upon this his Excellency refu&s;ed to receive the memorial, and ordered Mr. Hicks to re|turn to the &s;hip; when he came back to the boat, he found that a guard had been put on board in his ab&s;ence, but he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to return till the &s;oldier was removed: the officer then proceeded to enforce the Viceroy's orders; he &s;eized all the boat's crew, and &s;ent them under an armed force to pri&s;on, putting Mr. Hicks at the &s;ame time into one of their own boats, and &s;ending him under a guard back to the &s;hip. As &s;oon as he had reported the&s;e particulars, I wrote again to the Viceroy, demanding my boat and crew, and in my letter inclo&s;ed the me|morial which he had refu&s;ed to receive from Mr. Hicks: the&s;e papers I &s;ent by a petty officer, that I might wave the di&s;pute about a guard, again&s;t which I had never objected except when there was a commi&s;&s;ioned officer on board the boat. The petty officer was permitted to go on &s;hore with his guard, and, having delivered his letter, was told that an an&s;wer would be &s;ent the next day.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock this evening it began to blow very hard in &s;udden gu&s;ts from the South, and our long boat coming on board ju&s;t at this time with four pipes of rum, the rope which was thrown to her from the &s;hip, and which was taken hold of by the people on board, unfortunately broke, and the boat which had come to the &s;hip before the wind, went adrift to windward of her, with a &s;mall &s;kiff of Mr. Banks's that was fa&s;tened to her &s;tern. This was a great misfortune, as the pin|nace
<PB N="15" REF="013324_0042_0F8FFA3419A53B38">
being detained on &s;hore, we had no boat on board but a four oar'd yawl; the yawl, however, was immediately manned, and &s;ent to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t ef|fort of the people in both boats, they were very &s;oon out of &s;ight; far indeed we could not &s;ee at that time in the evening, but the di&s;tance was enough to convince us that they were not under command, which gave us great unea&s;ine&s;s, as we knew they mu&s;t drive directly upon a reef of rocks which ran out ju&s;t to leeward of where we lay: after waiting &s;ome hours in the utmo&s;t anxiety, we gave them over for lo&s;t, but about three o'clock the next morning had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee all the people come on board in the yawl. From them we learnt that the long-boat having filled with water they had brought her to a grappling and left her; and that, having fallen in with a reef of rocks in their return to the &s;hip, they had been obliged to cut Mr. Banks's little boat adrift. As the lo&s;s of our long-boat, which we had now too much rea&s;on to apprehend, would have been an un&s;peakable di&s;advantage to us, con&s;idering the nature of our expedition, I &s;ent another letter to the Viceroy, as &s;oon as I thought he could be &s;een, acquainting him with our misfor|tune, and reque&s;ting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a boat from the &s;hore for the recovery of our own; I al&s;o renewed my demand that the pinnace and her crew &s;hould be no longer detained; after &s;ome delay his Excellency thought fit to comply both with my re|que&s;t and demand; and the &s;ame day we happily recovered both the long-boat and &s;kiff, with the rum, but every thing el&s;e that was on board was lo&s;t. On the 23d, the Viceroy, in his an&s;wer to my remon&s;trance again&s;t &s;eizing my men, and de|taining the boat, acknowledged that I had been treated with &s;ome incivility, but &s;aid that the re&s;i&s;tance of my officers, to what he had declared to be the King's orders, made it ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary; he al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts whether the Endea|vour, con&s;idering her &s;tructure and other circum&s;tances, was in the &s;ervice of his Maje&s;ty, though I had before &s;hewed him my commi&s;&s;ion; to this I an&s;wered in writing, That, to remove all &s;cruples, I was ready to produce my commi&s;&s;ion again. His Excellency's &s;cruples however &s;till remained, and in his reply to my letter, he not only expre&s;&s;ed them in &s;till plainer terms, but, accu&s;ed my people of &s;muggling. This charge I am con|fident was without the lea&s;t foundation in truth. Mr. Banks's &s;ervants had indeed found means to go on &s;hore on the 22d, at day-break, and &s;tay till it was dark in the evening, but they brought on board only plants and in&s;ects, having been &s;ent for no other purpo&s;e. And I had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe that not a &s;ingle article was &s;muggled by any of our people who were admitted on &s;hore, though many artful means were u&s;ed to tempt them even by the very officers that were under his Excel|lency's roof, which made the charge &s;till more injurious and
<PB N="16" REF="013324_0043_0F90F0F70F3182D8">
provoking. I have indeed &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that one poor fellow bought a &s;ingle bottle of rum with &s;ome of the clothes upon his back; and in my an&s;wer I reque&s;ted of his Excellency, that if &s;uch an attempt at illicit trade &s;hould be repeated, he would without &s;cruple order the offender to be taken into cu&s;tody. And thus ended our altercation, both by conference and writing, with the Viceroy of Rio de Janeiro.</P>
<P>A friar in the town having reque&s;ted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our &s;ur|geon, Dr. Solander ea&s;ily got admittance in that character on the 25th, and received many marks of civility from the people. On the 26th, before day-break, Mr. Banks al&s;o found means to elude the vigilance of the people in the guard-boat, and got on &s;hore; he did not however go into the town, for the princi|pal objects of his curio&s;ity were to be found in the fields: to him al&s;o the people behaved with great civility, many of them invited him to their hou&s;es, and he bought a porker and &s;ome other things of them for the &s;hip's company; the porker, which was by no means lean, co&s;t him eleven &s;hil|lings, and he paid &s;omething le&s;s than two for a Mu&s;covy duck.</P>
<P>On the 27th when the boats returned from watering, the people told us there was a report in town, that &s;earch was making after &s;ome per&s;ons who had been on &s;hore from the &s;hip without the Viceroy's permi&s;&s;ion; the&s;e per&s;ons we con|jectured to be Dr. Solander and Mr. Banks, and therefore they determined to go on &s;hore no more.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of December, having got our water and other nece&s;&s;aries on board, I went to the Viceroy for a pilot to car|ry us to &s;ea, who came off to us; but the wind preventing us from getting out, we took on board a plentiful &s;upply of fre&s;h beef, yams and greens for the &s;hip's company. On the 2d, a Spani&s;h packet arrived with letters from Buenos Ayres for Spain, commanded by Don Antonio de Monte Negro-y Vale&s;co, who with great politene&s;s offered to take our letters to Europe: I accepted the favour, and gave him a packet for the Secretary of the Admiralty, containing copies of all the papers that had pa&s;&s;ed between me and the Viceroy; leaving al&s;o duplicates with the Viceroy, to be by him forwarded to Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>On Monday the 5th, it being a dead calm, we weigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and towed down the bay; but, to our great a&s;toni&s;hment, when we got abrea&s;t of Santa Cruz, the principal fortification, two &s;hot were fired at us. We immediately ca&s;t anchor, and &s;ent to the fort to enquire the rea&s;on of what had happened: our people brought us word, That the Commandant had re|ceived no order from the Viceroy to let us pa&s;s; and that with|out &s;uch an order, no ve&s;&s;el was ever &s;uffered to go below the fort. It was now, therefore become nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould &s;end to the Viceroy to enquire why the nece&s;&s;ary order had not been given, as he had notice of our departure, and had thought
<PB N="17" REF="013324_0044_0F90F0F89C5EB200">
fit to write me a polite letter, wi&s;hing me a good voyage. Our me&s;&s;enger &s;oon returned with an account, that the order had been written &s;ome days, but by an unaccountable negligence not &s;ent.</P>
<P>We did not get under &s;ail till the 7th; and, when we had pa&s;&s;ed the fort, the pilot de&s;ired to be di&s;charged. As &s;oon as he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, we were left by our guard-boat, which had hovered about us from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fir&s;t hour of our being in this place to the la&s;t: and Mr. Banks, having been prevented from going a&s;hore at Rio de Janeiro, availed him&s;elf of her departure to ex|amine the neighbouring i&s;lands, where, particularly on one in the mouth of the harbour called Raza, he gathered many &s;pecies of plants, and caught a variety of in&s;ects.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that, during the la&s;t three or four days of our &s;taying in this harbour, the air was loaded with butterflies: they were chiefly of one &s;ort, but in &s;uch numbers that thou|&s;ands were in view in every direction, and the greate&s;t part of them above our ma&s;t-head.</P>
<P>We lay here from the 14th of November to the 7th of De|cember, &s;omething more than three weeks, during which time Mr. Monkhou&s;e, our Surgeon, was on &s;hore every day to buy our provi&s;ions; Dr. Solander was on &s;hore once; I was &s;everal times on &s;hore my&s;elf, and Mr. Banks al&s;o found means to get into the country, notwith&s;tanding the watch that was &s;et over us. I &s;hall, therefore, with the intelligence obtained from the&s;e Gentlemen, and my own ob&s;ervations, give &s;ome account of the town, and the country adjacent.</P>
<P>Rio de Janeiro, or the river Januarius, was probably &s;o cal|led from its having been di&s;covered on the fea&s;t-day of that &s;aint: and the town, which is the capital of the Portugue&s;e do|minions in America, derives its name from the river, which indeed is rather an arm of the &s;ea, for it did not appear to re|ceive any con&s;iderable &s;tream of fre&s;h water; it &s;tands on a plain, clo&s;e to the &s;hore, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the bay, at the foot of &s;everal high mountains which ri&s;e behind it. It is neither ill de&s;igned, nor ill built; the hou&s;es in general are of &s;tone, and two &s;tories high; every hou&s;e having, after the manner of the Portugue&s;e, a little balcony before its windows, and a lattice of wood before the balcony. I computed its circuit to be about three miles; for it appears to be equal in &s;ize to the large&s;t country towns in England, Bri&s;tol and Liverpool not excepted; the &s;treets are &s;traight, and of a convenient breadth, inter&s;ecting each other at right angles; the greater part however lie on a line with the citadel, called St. Saba&s;tian, which &s;tands on the top of a hill that commands the town.</P>
<P>It is &s;upplied with water from the neighbouring hills, by an aqueduct which is rai&s;ed upon two &s;tories of arches, and is &s;aid in &s;ome places to be at a great height from the ground, from
<PB N="18" REF="013324_0045_0F90F0F95B0816F8">
which the water is conveyed by pipes into a fountain in the great &s;quare that exactly fronts the Viceroy's palace. At this fountain great numbers of people are continually waiting for their turn to draw water; and the &s;oldiers, who are po&s;ted at the Governor's door, find it very difficult to maintain any re|gularity among them. The water at this fountain however is &s;o bad, that we, who had been two months at &s;ea, confined to that in our ca&s;ks, which was almo&s;t always foul, could not drink it with plea&s;ure. Water of a better quality is laid into &s;ome other part of the town, but I could not learn by what means.</P>
<P>The churches are very fine, and there is more religious pa|rade in this place than in any of the Popi&s;h countries in Europe: there is a proce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome pari&s;h every day, with various in|&s;ignia, all &s;plendid and co&s;tly in the highe&s;t degree: they beg money, and &s;ay prayers in great form, at the corner of every &s;treet.</P>
<P>While we lay here, one of the churches was rebuilding; and to defray the expence, the pari&s;h to which it belonged had leave to beg in proce&s;&s;ion through the whole city once a week, by which very con&s;iderable &s;ums were collected. At this cere|money, which was performed by night, all the boys of a cer|tain age were obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t, the &s;ons of Gentlemen not being excu&s;ed. Each of the&s;e boys was dre&s;&s;ed in a black ca&s;&s;ock, with a &s;hort red cloak, hanging about as low as the wai&s;t, and carried in his hand a pole about &s;ix or &s;even feet long, at the end of which was tied a lantern: the number of lanterns was ge|nerally above two hundred, and the light they gave was &s;o great, that the people who &s;aw it from the cabbin windows thought the town had been on fire.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, however, may pay their devotions at the &s;hrine of any &s;aint in the calendar, without waiting till there is a proce&s;&s;ion; for before almo&s;t every hou&s;e there is a little cupboard, furni&s;hed with a gla&s;s window, in which one of the&s;e tutelary powers is waiting to be gracious; and to prevent his being out of mind, by being out of &s;ight, a lamp is kept con|&s;tantly burning before the window of his tabernacle in the night. The people indeed are by no means remi&s;s in their devotions, for before the&s;e &s;aints they pray and &s;ing hymns with &s;uch vehe|mence, that in the night they were very di&s;tinctly heard on board the &s;hip, though &s;he lay at the di&s;tance of at lea&s;t half a mile from the town.</P>
<P>The government here, as to its form is mixed; it is not|with&s;tanding very de&s;potic in fact. It con&s;i&s;ts of the Viceroy, the Governor of the town, and a council, the number of which I could not learn; without the con&s;ent of this council, in which the Viceroy has a ca&s;ting vote, no judicial act &s;hould be per|formed: yet both the Viceroy and Governor frequently com|mit
<PB N="19" REF="013324_0046_0F90F0FA0B30CEA0">
per&s;ons to pri&s;on at their own plea&s;ure, and &s;ometimes &s;end them to Li&s;bon, without acquainting their friends or family with what is laid to their charge, or where they may be found.</P>
<P>To re&s;train the people from travelling into the country, and getting into any di&s;trict where gold or diamonds may be found, of both which there is much more than the government can otherwi&s;e &s;ecure, certain bounds are pre&s;cribed them, at the di&s;cretion of the Viceroy, &s;ometimes at a few, and &s;ometimes at many miles di&s;tance from the city. On the verge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> limits a guard con&s;tantly patroles, and whoever is found beyond it is immediately &s;eized and thrown into pri&s;on: and if a man is, upon any pretence, taken up by the guard without the limits, he will be &s;ent to pri&s;on, though it &s;hould appear that he did not know their extent.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, which are very numerous, con&s;i&s;t of Por|tugue&s;e, Negroes, and Indians, the original natives of the coun|try. The town&s;hip of Rio, which, as I was told is but a &s;mall part of the Capitanea, or province, is &s;aid to contain 37,000 White per&s;ons, and 629,000 Blacks, many of whom are free; making together 666,000, in the proportion of &s;eventeen to one. The Indians, who are employed to do the King's work in this neighbourhood, can &s;carcely be con&s;idered as inhabi|tants; their re&s;idence is at a di&s;tance, from whence they come by turns to their ta&s;k, which they are obliged to perform for a &s;mall pay. The guard-boat was con&s;tantly rowed by the&s;e people, who are of a light copper colour, and have long black hair.</P>
<P>The military e&s;tabli&s;hment here con&s;i&s;ts of twelve regiments of regular troops, &s;ix of which are Portugue&s;e and &s;ix Creoles; and twelve other regiments of provincial militia. To the re|gulars the inhabitants behave with the utmo&s;t humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: and I was told that if any of them &s;hould neglect to take off his hat upon meeting an officer, he would immediate|ly be knocked down. The&s;e haughty &s;ervitudes render the people extremely civil to any &s;tranger who has the appearance of a Gentleman. But the &s;ubordination of the officers them|&s;elves to the Viceroy is enforced with circum&s;tances equally mortifying, for they are obliged to attend in his hall three times every day to a&s;k his commands: the an&s;wer con&s;tantly is. "There is nothing new." I have been told, that this &s;ervile attendance is exacted to prevent their going into the country; and if &s;o, it effectually an&s;wers the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is, I believe, univer&s;ally allowed, that the women, both of the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e &s;ettlements in South America, make le&s;s difficulty of granting per&s;onal favours, than tho&s;e of any other civilized country in the world. Of the Ladies of this town &s;ome have formed &s;o unfavourable an opinion as to de|clare, that they did not believe there was a mode&s;t one among
<PB N="20" REF="013324_0047_0F90F0FAE6009788">
them. This cen&s;ure is certainly too general; but what Dr. Solander &s;aw of them when he was on &s;hore, gave him no very exalted idea of their cha&s;tity: he told me, than as &s;oon as it was dark, one or more appeared in every window, and di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e whom they liked, among the Gentlemen that walked pa&s;t them, by giving them no&s;egays; that he, and two Gen|tlemen who were with him, received &s;o many of the&s;e favours, that, at the end of their walk, which was not a long one, they threw whole hatfuls of them away. Great allowance mu&s;t cer|tainly be made for local cu&s;toms: that which in one country would be indecent familiarity, is a mere act of general courte&s;y in another; of the fact, therefore, which I have related, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, but I am confident it is true.</P>
<P>Neither will I take upon me to affirm, that murders are frequently committed here; but the churches afford an a&s;ylum to the criminal: and as our cock&s;wain was one day looking at two men, who appeared to be talking together in a friendly manner, one of them &s;uddenly drew a knife and &s;tabbed the other; who not in&s;tantly falling, the murderer withdrew the weapon, and &s;tabbed him a &s;econd time. He then ran away, and was pur&s;ued by &s;ome Negroes who were al&s;o witne&s;&s;es of the fact; but whether he e&s;caped or was taken I never heard.</P>
<P>The country, at a &s;mall di&s;tance round the town, which is all that any of us &s;aw, is beautiful in the highe&s;t degree; the wilde&s;t &s;pots being varied with a greater luxuriance of flowers, both as to number and beauty, than the be&s;t gardens in England.</P>
<P>Upon the trees and bu&s;hes &s;at an almo&s;t endle&s;s variety of birds, e&s;pecially &s;mall ones, many of them covered with the mo&s;t elegant plumage; among which were the humming-bird. Of in&s;ects too there was a great variety, and &s;ome of them very beautiful; but they were much more nimble than tho&s;e of Europe, e&s;pecially the butterflies, mo&s;t of which flew near the tops of the trees, and were therefore very difficult to be caught, except when the &s;ea breeze blew fre&s;h, which kept them nearer to the ground.</P>
<P>The banks of the &s;ea, and of the &s;mall brooks which water this part of the country, are almo&s;t covered with the &s;mall crabs called <HI>Cancer vocans;</HI> &s;ome of the&s;e had one of the claws, called by naturali&s;ts the hand, very large; others had them both remarkably &s;mall, and of equal &s;ize, a difference which is &s;aid to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;exes, that with the large claw being the male.</P>
<P>There is the appearance of but little cultivation; the greater part of the land is wholly uncultivated, and very little care and labour &s;eem to have been be&s;towed upon the re&s;t; there are indeed little patches or gardens, in which many kinds of Eu|ropean garden &s;tuff are produced, particularly cabbages, peas, beans, kidney-beans, turnips, and white radi&s;hes, but all

much inferior to our own water melons and pine apples are al&s;o produced in the&s;e &s;pots, and they are the only fruits that we &s;aw cultivated, though the country produces mu&s;k melons, oranges, limes, lemons, &s;weet lemons, citrons, plantains, bananas, mangos, mamane apples, acajou or ca&s;hou apples and nuts; jamboir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of two kinds, one of which bears a &s;mall black fruit; cocoa nuts, mangos, palm nuts of two kinds, one long, the other round; and palm berries, all which were in &s;ea&s;on while we were there.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e fruits the water melons and oranges are the be&s;t in their kind; the pine apples are much inferior to tho&s;e that I have eaten in England; they are indeed more juicy and &s;weet, but have no flavour; I believe them to be natives of this country, though we heard of none that at this time grow wild; they have, however, very little care be&s;towed upon them, the plants being &s;et between beds of any kind of garden-&s;tuff, and &s;uffered to take the chance of the &s;ea&s;on. The melons are &s;till wor&s;e, at lea&s;t tho&s;e that we ta&s;ted, which were mealy and in&s;ipid; but the water melons are excellent; they have a flavour, at lea&s;t a degree of acidity, which ours have not. We &s;aw al&s;o &s;everal &s;pecies of the prickle pear, and &s;ome European fruits, parti|cularly the apple and peach, both which were very mealy and in&s;ipid. In the&s;e gardens al&s;o grow yams, and mandihoca, which in the We&s;t Indies is called Ca&s;&s;ada or Ca&s;&s;ava, and to the flour of which the people here, as I have before ob&s;erved, give the name of <HI>Farinha de Pao,</HI> which may not improperly be tran&s;lated, Powder of po&s;t. The &s;oil, though it produces tobacco and &s;ugar, will not produce bread-corn; &s;o that the people here have no wheat-flour, but what is brought from Por|tugal, and &s;old at the rate of a &s;hilling a pound, though it is generally &s;poiled by being heated in its pa&s;&s;age. Mr. Banks is of opinion, that all the products of our We&s;t Indian i&s;lands would grow here; notwith&s;tanding which, the inhabitants import their coffee and chocolate from Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the land, as far as we &s;aw of the country, is laid down in gra&s;s, upon which cattle are pa&s;tured in great plenty; but they are &s;o lean, that an Engli&s;hman will &s;carcely eat of their fle&s;h: the herbage of the&s;e pa&s;tures con&s;i&s;ts principally of cre&s;&s;es, and con&s;equently is &s;o &s;hort, that though it may afford a bite for hor&s;es and &s;heep, it can &s;carcely be grazed by horned cattle in a &s;ufficient quantity to keep them alive.</P>
<P>This country may po&s;&s;ibly produce many valuable drugs; but we could not find any in the apothecaries &s;hops, except pareira brava, and bal&s;am capivi; both of which were excellent in their kind, and &s;old at a very low price. The drug trade is probably carried on to the northward, as well as that of the dying woods, for we could get no intelligence of either of them here. As to manufactures, we neither &s;aw nor heard of
<PB N="22" REF="013324_0049_0F90F0FCF365F198">
any, except that of cotton hammocks, in which people are carried about here, as they are with us in &s;edan chairs; and the&s;e are principally, if not wholly, fabricated by the Indians.</P>
<P>The riches of the place con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the mines, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to lie far up the country, though we could never learn where, or at what di&s;tance; for the &s;ituation is concealed as much as po&s;&s;ible, and troops are continually employed in guarding the roads that lead to them: it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for any man to get the &s;ight of them, except tho&s;e who are em|ployed there; and indeed the &s;tronge&s;t curio&s;ity would &s;carcely in|duce any man to attempt it, for whoever is found upon the road to them, if he cannot give undeniable evidence of his having bu&s;ine&s;s there, is immediately hanged up upon the next tree.</P>
<P>Much gold is certainly brought from the&s;e mines, but at an expence of life, that mu&s;t &s;trike every man, to whom cu&s;tom has not made it familiar, with horror. No le&s;s than forty thou&s;and negroes are annually imported, on the king's account, to dig the mines; and we were credibly informed, that, the la&s;t year but one before we arrived here, this number fell &s;o &s;hort, probably from &s;ome epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, that twenty thou&s;and more were draughted from the town of Rio.</P>
<P>Precious &s;tones are al&s;o found here in &s;uch plenty, that a certain quantity only is allowed to be collected in a year; to collect this quantity, a number of people are &s;ent into the country where they are found, and when it is got together, which &s;ometimes happens in a month, &s;ometimes in le&s;s and &s;ometimes in more, they return; and after that, whoever is found in the&s;e precious di&s;tricts, on any pretence, before the next year, is immediately put to death.</P>
<P>The jewels found here, are diamonds, topazes of &s;everal kinds, and amethy&s;ts. We did not &s;ee any of the diamonds, but were informed that the Viceroy had a large quantity by him, which he would &s;ell on the King of Portugal's account, but not at a le&s;s price than they are &s;old for in Europe. Mr. Banks bought a few topazes and amethy&s;ts as &s;pecimens: of the to|pazes there are three &s;orts, of very different value, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed here by the names of Pinga d'agua qualidade pri|meiro, Pinga d'agua qualidade &s;ecundo, and Chry&s;tallos arme|rillos: they are &s;old, large and &s;mall, good and bad together, by octavos, or the eighth part of an ounce; the be&s;t at 4s. 9d. All dealing, however, in the&s;e &s;tones is prohibited to the &s;ub|ject, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties: there were jewellers here for|merly, who purcha&s;ed and worked them on their own account; but about fourteen months before our arrival, orders came from the court of Portugal, that no more &s;tones &s;hould be wrought here, except on the King's account: the jewellers were ordered to bring all their tools to the Viceroy, and left without any means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The per&s;ons employed here to work &s;tones for the King are &s;laves.</P>

The coin that is current here, is either that of Portugal, con|&s;i&s;ting chiefly of thirty-&s;ix &s;hillings pieces; or pieces, both of gold and &s;ilver, which are &s;truck at this place: the pieces of &s;ilver, which are very much deba&s;ed, are called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and are of different value, and ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by the number of rees that is marked on the out&s;ide.

<P>The harbour of Rio de Janeiro is &s;ituated We&s;t by North 8 leagues from Cape Trio, and may be known by a remarkable hill, in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf, at the we&s;t point of the bay; but as all the coa&s;t is very high, and ri&s;es in many peaks, the entrance of this harbour may be more certainly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the i&s;lands that lie before it; one of which, called Rodonda, is high and round like a hay-&s;tack, and lies at the di&s;tance of two leagues and an half from the entrance of the bay, in the direction of S. by W.; but the fir&s;t i&s;lands which are met with, coming from the ea&s;t, or Cape Trio, are two that have a rocky appearance, lying near to each other, and at the di&s;tance of about four miles from the &s;hore: there are al&s;o at the di&s;tance of three leagues to the we&s;tward of the&s;e, two other i&s;lands which lie near to each other, a little without the bay on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and very near the &s;hore. This harbour is certainly a good one; the entrance indeed is not wide, but the &s;ea breeze, which blows every day from ten or twelve o'clock till &s;un&s;et, makes it ea&s;y for any &s;hip to go in before the wind; and it grows wider as the town is approached, &s;o that abrea&s;t of it there is room for the large&s;t fleet, in five or &s;ix fathom water, with an oozy bottom. At the narrow part, the entrance is defended by two forts. The principal is Santa Cruz, which &s;tands on the ea&s;t point of the bay, and has been mentioned before; that on the we&s;t &s;ide is called fort Lozia, and is built upon a rock that lies clo&s;e to the main; the di&s;tance between them is about &frac34; of a mile, but the channel is not quite &s;o broad, becau&s;e there are &s;unken rocks which lie off each fort, and in this part alone there is danger: the narrowne&s;s of the channel cau&s;es the tides, both flood and ebb, to run with con&s;iderable &s;trength, &s;o that they cannot be &s;temmed without a fre&s;h breeze. The rockyne&s;s of the bottom makes it al&s;o un&s;afe to anchor here; but all danger may be avoided by keeping in the middle of the channel. Within the entrance, the cour&s;e up the bay is fir&s;t N. by W. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> W. and N. N. W. &s;omething more than a league; this will bring the ve&s;&s;el the length of the great road; and N. W. and W. N. W. one league more will carry her to the I&s;le dos Cobras, which lies before the city: &s;he &s;hould then keep the north &s;ide of this i&s;land clo&s;e on board, and anchor above it, before a mona&s;tery of Benedictines which &s;tands upon a hill at the N. W. end of the city.</P>

The river, and indeed the whole coa&s;t, abounds with a greater variety of fi&s;h than we had ever &s;een; a day &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed in which one or more of a new &s;pecies were not brought to Mr. Banks: the bay al&s;o is as well adapted for catching the&s;e fi&s;h as can be conceived; for it is full of &s;mall i&s;lands, between which there is &s;hallow water, and proper beaches for drawing the &s;eine. The &s;ea, without the bay, abounds with dolphins, and large mackrel of different kinds, which readily bite at a hook, and the inhabitants always tow one after their boats for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Though the climate is hot, the &s;ituation of this place is cer|tainly whole&s;ome; while we &s;tayed here the thermometer never ro&s;e higher than 83, though we had frequent rains, and once a very hard gale of wind.</P>
<P>Ships water here at the fountain in the great &s;quare, though, as I have ob&s;erved, the water is not good; they land their ca&s;ks upon a &s;mooth &s;andy beach, which is not more than a hundred yards di&s;tant from the fountain, and upon application to the Viceroy, a centinel will be appointed to look after them, and clear the way to the fountain where they are to be filled.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Rio de Janeiro is a very good place for &s;hips to put in at, that want refre&s;hment: the harbour is &s;afe and commodious; and provi&s;ions, except wheaten bread and flour, may be ea&s;ily procured: as a &s;uccedaneum for bread, there are ya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s and ca&s;&s;ada in plenty; beef, both fre&s;h and jerked, may be bought at about two pence farthing a pound; though, as I have before remarked, it is very lean. The people here jerk their beef by taking out the bones, cutting it into large but thin &s;lices, then curing it with &s;alt, and drying it in the &s;hade: it eats very well, and, if kept dry, will remain good a long time at &s;ea. Mutton is &s;carcely to be procured, and hogs and poultry are dear; of garden-&s;tuff and fruit there is abundance, of which, however, none can be pre&s;erved at &s;ea but the pumpkin; rum, &s;ugar, and mola&s;&s;es, all excellent in their kind, may be had at a rea&s;onable price; tobacco al&s;o is cheap, but it is not good. Here is a yard for building &s;hipping, and a &s;mall hulk to heave down by; for, as the tide never ri&s;es above &s;ix or &s;even foot, there is no other way of coming at a &s;hip's bottom.</P>

<P>ON the 9th of December, we ob&s;erved the &s;ea to be covered with broad &s;treaks of a yellowi&s;h colour, &s;everal of them a mile long, and three or four hundred yards wide: &s;ome of the water thus coloured was taken up, and found to be full of

innumerable atoms pointed at the end, of a yellowi&s;h colour, and none more than a quarter of a line, or the fortieth part of an inch long: in the micro&s;cope they appeared to be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of &s;mall fibres interwoven with each other, not unlike the nidus of &s;ome of the <HI>Phyganeas,</HI> called Caddices; but whether they were animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, whence they came, or for what they were de&s;igned neither Mr. Banks nor Dr. Solander could gue&s;s. The &s;ame appearance had been ob&s;erved before, when we fir&s;t di&s;covered the continent of South America.</P>
<P>On the 11th we hooked a &s;hark, and while we were playing it under the cabbin window, it threw out, and drew in again &s;everal times what appeared to be its &s;tomach: it proved to be a female, and upon being opened &s;ix young ones were taken out of it; five of them were alive and &s;wam bri&s;kly in a tub of water, but the &s;ixth appeared to have been dead &s;ometime.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened till the 30th, except that we prepared for the bad weather, which we were &s;hortly to expect, by bending a new &s;uit of &s;ails; but on this day we ran a cour&s;e of one hundred and &s;ixty miles by the log, through innumerable land in&s;ects of various kinds, &s;ome upon the wing, and more upon the water, many of which were alive; they appeared to be exactly the &s;ame with the <HI>Cara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i,</HI> the <HI>Grylli,</HI> the <HI>Phalanae, Aranea,</HI> and other flies that are &s;een in England, though at this time we could not be le&s;s than thirty leagues from land; and &s;ome of the&s;e in&s;ects, particularly the <HI>Grylli</HI> and <HI>Aranea,</HI> never voluntarily leave it at a greater di&s;tance than twenty yards. We judged our&s;elves to be now nearly oppo&s;ite to <HI>Baye &s;ans fond,</HI> where Mr. Dalrymple &s;uppo&s;es there is a pa&s;&s;age quite through the continent of America; and we thought from the in&s;ects that there might be at lea&s;t a very large river, and that it had over|flowed its banks.</P>
<P>On the 3d of January, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">769, being in latitude 47:17 S. and longitude 61:29 45 W. we were all looking out for Pepy's i&s;land, and for &s;ome time an appearance was &s;een in the ea&s;t which &s;o much re&s;embled land, that we bore away for it; and it was more than two hours and an half before we were con|vinced that it was nothing but what &s;ailors call a Fogbank.</P>
<P>The people now beginning to complain of cold, each of them received what is called a Magellanic jacket, and a pair of trow&s;ers. The jacket is made of a thick woollen-&s;tuff, called <HI>Fearnought,</HI> which is provided by the government. We &s;aw, from time to time, a great number of penguins, albatro&s;&s;es, and &s;heer waters, &s;eals, whales, and porpoi&s;es: and on the 11th, having pa&s;&s;ed Falkland's i&s;lands, we di&s;covered the coa&s;t of Terra del Fuego, at the di&s;tance of about four leagues, ex|tending from the W. to S. E. by S. We had here five and thirty fathom, the ground &s;oft, &s;mall &s;tate &s;tones. As we ranged along the &s;hore to the S.

by the natives, probably as a &s;ignal, for they did not continue it after we had pa&s;&s;ed by. This day we di&s;covered that the &s;hip had got near a degree of longitude to the we&s;tward of the log, which, in this latitude, is 35 minutes of a degree on the equator: probably there is a &s;mall current &s;etting to the we&s;tward, which may be cau&s;ed by the we&s;terly current coming rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d Cape Horn, and through the Streight of Le Maire, and the indraught of the Streight of Magellan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The celebrated navigator who di&s;covered this Streight was a native of Portugal, and his name, in the language of his country, was <HI>Fernando de Ma|galhaens;</HI> the Spaniards call him <HI>Hernando Magalhanes,</HI> and the French <HI>Ma|gellan,</HI> which is the orthography that has been generally adopted: a Gentle|man, the fifth in de&s;cent from this great adventurer, is now living in or near London, and communicated the true name of his ance&s;tor to Mr. Banks, with a reque&s;t that it might be in&s;erted in this work.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having continued to range the coa&s;t, on the 14th we entered the Streight of Le Maire; but the tide turning again&s;t us, drove us out with great violence, and rai&s;ed &s;uch a &s;ea off Cape St. Diego, that the waves had exactly the &s;ame appearance as they would have had if they had broke over a ledge of rocks; and when the &s;hip was in this torrent, &s;he frequently pitched, &s;o that the bow&s;prit was under water. About noon, we got under the land between Cape St. Diego and Cape St. Vincent, where I intended to have anchored; but finding the ground every where hard and rocky, and &s;hallowing from thirty to twelve fathoms, I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter to examine a little cove which lay at a &s;mall di&s;tance to the ea&s;tward of Cape St. Vincent. When he returned, he reported, that there was anchorage in four fathom, and a good bottom, clo&s;e to the ea&s;tward of the fir&s;t bluff point, on the ea&s;t of Cape St. Vincent, at the very en|trance of the cove, to which I gave the name of VINCENT's Bay: before this anchoring ground, however, lay &s;everal rocky ledges, that were covered with &s;ea-weed; but I was told that there was not le&s;s than eight and nine fathom over all of them. It will probably be thought &s;trange, that where weeds, which grow at the bottom, appear above the &s;urface, there &s;hould be this depth of water; but the weeds which grow upon rocky ground in the&s;e countries, and which always di&s;tingui&s;h it from &s;and and ooze, are of an enormous &s;ize. The leaves are four foot long, and &s;ome of the &s;talks, though not thicker than a man's thumb, above one hundred and twenty: Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander examined &s;ome of them, over which we &s;ounded and had fourteen fathom, which is eighty-four feet; and, as they made a very acute angle with the bottom, they were thought to be at lea&s;t one half longer: the foot &s;talks were &s;welled into an air ve&s;&s;el, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander called this plant <HI>Fucus giganteus.</HI> Upon the report of the Ma&s;ter, I &s;tood in with the &s;hip; but not tru&s;ting implicity to his intelligence, I continued to &s;ound, and found but four
<PB N="27" REF="013324_0054_0F90F10025A05300">
fathom upon the fir&s;t ledge that I went over; concluding, therefore, that I could not anchor here without ri&s;k, I deter|mined to &s;eek &s;ome port in the Streight, where I might get on board &s;uch wood and water as we wanted.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, however, being very de&s;irous to go on &s;hore, I &s;ent a boat with them and their people, while I kept plying as near as po&s;&s;ible with the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Having been on &s;hore four hours, they returned about nine in the evening, with above an hundred different plants and flowers, all of them wholly unknown to the botani&s;ts of Europe. They found the country about the bay to be in general flat, the bottom of it in particular was a plain, covered with gra&s;s, which might ea&s;ily have been made into a large quantity of hay; they found al&s;o abundance of good wood and water, and fowl in great plenty. Among other things, of which Nature has been liberal in this place, is Winter's bark, <HI>Winteranea aromatica;</HI> which may ea&s;ily be known by its broad leaf, &s;haped like the laurel, of a light green colour without, and inclining to blue within: the bark is ea&s;ily &s;tripped with a bone or a &s;tick, and its virtues are well known: it may be u&s;ed for culinary purpo&s;es an a &s;pice, and is not le&s;s plea&s;ant than whole&s;ome: here is al&s;o plenty of wild celery and &s;curvy-gra&s;s. The trees are chiefly of one kind, a &s;pecies of the birch, called <HI>Betula antarctica;</HI> the &s;tem is from thirty to forty feet long, and from two to three feet in diameter, &s;o that in a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity they might po&s;&s;ibly &s;upply a &s;hip with top-ma&s;ts: they are a light white wood, bear a &s;mall leaf, and cleave very &s;traight. Cranberries were al&s;o found here in great plenty, both white and red.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who landed &s;aw none of the inhabitants, but fell in with two of their de&s;erted huts, one in a thick wood, and the other clo&s;e by the beach.</P>
<P>Having taken the boat on board, I made &s;ail into the Streight, and at three in the morning of the 15th, I anchored in twelve fathom an a half, upon coral rocks, before a &s;mall cove, which we took for Port Maurice, at the di&s;tance of about half a mile from the &s;hore. Two of the natives came down to the beach, expecting us to land; but this &s;pot afforded &s;o little &s;helter, that I at length determined not to examine it: I therefore got under &s;ail again about ten o'clock, and the &s;avages retired into the woods.</P>
<P>At two o'clock, we anchored in the bay of Good Succe&s;s; and after dinner I went on &s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, to look for a watering-place, and &s;peak to the Indians, &s;everal of whom had come in &s;ight. We landed on the &s;tarboard &s;ide of the bay near &s;ome rocks, which made &s;mooth water and good landing; thirty or forty of the Indians &s;oon made their appearance at the end of a &s;andy beach on the other &s;ide of the bay, but &s;eeing our number, which was ten or
<PB N="28" REF="013324_0055_0F90F100C89B00C0">
twelve, they retreated. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander then ad|vanced about one hundred yards before us, upon which two of the Indians returned, and, having advanced &s;ome paces towards them, far down; as &s;oon as they came up, the Indians ro&s;e, and each of them having a &s;mall &s;tick in his hand threw it away, in a direction both from them&s;elves and the &s;trangers, which was con&s;idered as the renunciation of weapons in token of peace: they then walked bri&s;kly towards their companions, who had halted at about fifty yards behind them, and beckoned the Gentlemen to follow, which they did. They were received with many uncouth &s;igns of friend&s;hip; and, in return, they di&s;tributed among them &s;ome beads and ribbons, which had been brought on &s;hore for that purpo&s;e, and with which they were greatly delighted. A mutual confidence and good-will being thus produced, our parties joined; the conver&s;ation, &s;uch as it was, became general; and three of them accompanied us back to the &s;hip. When they came on board, one of them, whom we took to be a prie&s;t, performed much the &s;ame cere|monies which M. Bougainville de&s;cribes, and &s;uppo&s;es to be an exorci&s;m. When he was introduced into a new part of the &s;hip, or when any thing that he had not &s;een before caught his atten|tion, he &s;houted with all his force for &s;ome minutes, without directing his voice either to as or his companions.</P>
<P>They eat &s;ome bread and &s;ome beef, but not apparently with much plea&s;ure, though &s;uch part of what was given them as they did not eat they took away with them; but they would not &s;wallow a drop either of wine or &s;pirits: they put the gla&s;s to their lips, but, having ta&s;ted the liquor, they returned it, with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;gu&s;t. Curio&s;ity &s;eems to be one of the few pa&s;&s;ions which di&s;tingui&s;h men from brutes; and of this our gue&s;ts appeared to have very little. They went from one part of the &s;hip to another, and looked at the va&s;t variety of new objects that every moment pre&s;ented them&s;elves, without any expre&s;&s;ion either of wonder or plea&s;ure, for the vociferation of our exorci&s;t &s;eemed to be neither.</P>
<P>After having been on board about two hours, they expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to go a&s;hore. A boat was immediately ordered, and Mr. Banks thought fit to accompany them: he landed them in &s;afety, and conducted them to their companions, among whom he remarked the &s;ame vacant indifference, as in tho&s;e who had been on board: for as on one &s;ide there appeared no eagerne&s;s to relate, &s;o on the other there &s;eemed to be no curio&s;ity to hear, how they had been received, or what they had &s;een. In about half an hour, Mr. Banks returned to the &s;hip, and the Indians retired from the &s;hore.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. An Account what happened in a&s;cending a Mountain to &s;earch for Plants.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 16th, early in the morning, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with their attendants and &s;ervants, and two &s;eamen to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying the baggage, accompanied by Mr. Monkhou&s;e the Surgeon, and Mr. Green the A&s;tronomer, &s;et out from the &s;hip, with a view to penetrate as far as they could into the country, and return at night. The hills, when viewed at a di&s;tance, &s;eemed to be partly a wood, partly a plain, and above them a bare rock. Mr. Banks hoped to get through the wood, and made no doubt, but that, beyond it, he &s;hould, in a country which no botani&s;t had ever yet vi&s;ited, find alpine plants which would abundantly compen&s;ate his labour. They entered the wood at a &s;mall &s;andy beach, a little to the we&s;t|ward of the watering-place, and continued to a&s;cend the hill, through the pathle&s;s wilderne&s;s, till three o'clock, before they got a near view of the places which they intended to vi&s;it. Soon after they reached what they had taken for a plain; but, to their great di&s;appointment, found it a &s;wamp, covered with low bu&s;hes of birch, about three feet high, interwoven with each other, and &s;o &s;tubborn that they could not be bent out of the way; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to lift the leg over them, which at every &s;tep was buried, ancle deep, in the &s;oil. To aggra|vate the pain and difficulty of &s;uch travelling, the weather, which hitherto had been very fine, much like one of our bright days in May, became gloomy and cold; with &s;udden bla&s;ts of a mo&s;t piercing wind, accompanied with &s;now. They pu&s;hed forward, however, in good &s;pirits, notwith&s;tanding their fa|tigue, hoping the wor&s;t of the way was pa&s;t, and that the bare rock which they had &s;een from the tops of the lower hills was not more than a mile before them; but when they had got about two thirds over this woody &s;wamp, Mr. Buchan, one of Mr. Banks's draughtmen, was unhappily &s;eized with a fit. This made it nece&s;&s;ary for the whole company to halt, and as it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould go any farther, a fire was kindled, and tho&s;e who were mo&s;t fatigued were left behind to take care of him. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Green, and Mr. Monkhou&s;e went on, and in a &s;hort time reached the &s;ummit. As botani&s;ts, their expectations were here abundantly gratified: for they found a great variety of plants, which, with re&s;pect to the alpine plants in Europe, are exactly what tho&s;e plants are with re&s;pect to &s;uch as grow in the plain.</P>
<P>The cold was now become more &s;evere, and the &s;now-bla&s;ts more frequent; the day al&s;o was &s;o far &s;pent, that it was found impo&s;&s;ible to get back to the &s;hip before the next morning: to pa&s;s the night upon &s;uch a mountain, in &s;uch a climate, was not only comfortle&s;s, but dreadful; it was impo&s;&s;ible however to
<PB N="30" REF="013324_0057_0F90F10233F748A0">
be avoided, and they were to provide for it as well as they could.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, while they were improving an opportunity which they had, with &s;o much danger and difficulty, procured, by gathering the plants which they found upon the mountain, &s;ent Mr. Green and Mr. Monkhou&s;e back to Mr. Buchan and the people that were with him, with directions to bring them to a hill, which they thought lay in a better rout for returning to the wood, and which was therefore appointed as a general rendezvous. It was propo&s;ed, that from this hill they &s;hould pu&s;h through the &s;wamp, which &s;eemed by the new root not to be more than half a mile over, into the &s;helter of the wood, and there build their wigwam, and make a fire: this, as their way was all down hill, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eemed ea&s;y to accom|pli&s;h. Their whole company a&s;&s;embled at the rendezvous, and, though pinched with the cold, were in health and &s;pirits, Mr. Buchan him&s;elf having recovered his &s;trength in a much greater degree than could have been expected. It was now near eight o'clock in the evening, but &s;till good day-light, and they &s;et forward for the neare&s;t valley, Mr. Banks him&s;elf undertaking to bring up the rear, and &s;ee that no &s;traggler was left behind: this may perhaps be thought a &s;uperfluous caution, but it will &s;oon appear to be otherwi&s;e. Dr. Solander, who had more than once cro&s;&s;ed the mountains which divide Sweden from Norway, well knew that extreme cold, e&s;pecially when joined with fatigue, produces a torpor and &s;leepine&s;s that are almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible: he therefore conjured the company to keep moving, whatever pain it might co&s;t them, and whatever relief they might be promi&s;ed by an inclination to re&s;t: Whoever &s;its down, &s;ays he, will &s;leep; and however &s;leeps, will wake no more. Thus, at once admoni&s;hed and alarmed, they &s;et for|ward; but while they were &s;till upon the naked rock, and before they had got among the bu&s;hes, the cold became &s;uddenly &s;o inten&s;e, as to produce the effects that had been mo&s;t dreaded. Dr. Solander him&s;elf was the fir&s;t who found the inclination, again&s;t which he had warned others, irre&s;i&s;tible; and in&s;i&s;ted upon being &s;uffered to lie down. Mr. Banks intreated and re|mon&s;trated in vain, down he lay upon the ground, though it was covered with &s;now; and it was with great difficulty that his friend kept him from &s;leeping. Richmond al&s;o, one of the black &s;ervants, began to linger, having &s;uffered from the cold in the &s;ame manner as the Doctor. Mr. Banks, therefore, &s;ent five of the company, among whom was Mr. Buchan, forward to get a fire ready at the fir&s;t convenient place they could find; and him&s;elf, with four others, remained with the Doctor and Richmond, whom partly by per&s;ua&s;ion and entreaty, and partly by force, they brought on; but when they had got through the greate&s;t part of the birch and &s;wamp, they both declared they could go no farther. Mr. Banks had recour&s;e again to entreaty
<PB N="31" REF="013324_0058_0F90F10306709328">
and expo&s;tulation, but they produced no effect: when Rich|mond was told, that if he did not go on he would in a &s;hort time be frozen to death; he an&s;wered, That he de&s;ired nothing but to lie down and die: the Doctor did not &s;o explicitly re|nounce his life; he &s;aid he was willing to go on, but that he mu&s;t fir&s;t take &s;ome &s;leep, though he had before told the com|pany that to &s;leep was to peri&s;h. Mr. Banks and the re&s;t found it impo&s;&s;ible to carry them, and there being no remedy, they were both &s;uffered to &s;it down, being partly &s;upported by the bu&s;hes, and in a few minutes they fell into a profound &s;leep: &s;oon after, &s;ome of the people who had been &s;ent forward re|turned, with the welcome news that a fire was kindled about a quarter of a mile farther on the way. Mr. Banks then en|deavoured to wake Dr. Solander and happily &s;ucceeded: but, though he had not &s;lept five minutes, he had almo&s;t lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs, and the mu&s;cles were &s;o &s;hrunk that his &s;hoes fell from his feet; he con&s;ented to go forward with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as could be given him, but no attempts to relieve poor Rich|mond were &s;ucce&s;sful. It being found impo&s;&s;ible to make him &s;tir, after &s;ome time had been lo&s;t in the attempt, Mr. Banks left his other black &s;ervant and a &s;eaman, who &s;eemed to have &s;uffered lea&s;t by the cold, to look after him; promi&s;ing, that as &s;oon as two others &s;hould be &s;ufficiently warmed, they &s;hould be relieved. Mr. Banks, with much difficulty, at length got the Doctor to the fire; and &s;oon after &s;ent two of the people who had been refre&s;hed, in hopes that with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who had been left behind, they would be able to bring Rich|mond, even though it &s;hould be &s;till found impo&s;&s;ible to wake him. In about half an hour, however, they had the mortifi|cation to &s;ee the&s;e two men return alone; they &s;aid, that they had been all round the place to which they had been directed, but could neither find Richmond nor tho&s;e who had been left with him; and that though they had &s;houted many times, no voice had replied. This was a matter of equal &s;urpri&s;e and concern, particularly to Mr. Banks, who, while he was won|dering how it could happen, mi&s;&s;ed a bottle of rum, the com|pany's whole &s;tock, which they now concluded to be in the knap&s;ack of one of the ab&s;entees. It was conjectured, that with this Richmond had been rouzed by the two per&s;ons who had been left with him, and that, having perhaps drank too freely of it them&s;elves, they had all rambled from the place where they had been left, in &s;earch of the fire, in&s;tead of wait|ing for tho&s;e who &s;hould have been their a&s;&s;i&s;tants and guides. Another fall of &s;now now came on, and continued ince&s;&s;antly for two hours, &s;o that all hope of &s;eeing them again, at lea&s;t alive, were given up; but about twelve o'clock, to the great joy of tho&s;e at the fire, a &s;houting, was heard at &s;ome di&s;tance. Mr. Banks, with four more, immediately went out, and found
<PB N="32" REF="013324_0059_0F904D8385933730">
the &s;eaman with ju&s;t &s;trength enough left to &s;tagger along, and call out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Mr. Banks &s;ent him immediately to the fire, and, by his direction, proceeded in &s;earch of the other two, whom he &s;oon after found. Richmond was upon his legs, but not able to put one before the other; his companion was lying upon the ground, as in&s;en&s;ible as a &s;tone. All hands were now called from the fire, and an attempt was made to carry them to it; but, this, notwith&s;tanding the united efforts of the whole company, was found to be impo&s;&s;ible. The night was extremely dark, the &s;now was now very deep, and, under the&s;e additional di&s;advantages, they found it very difficult to make way through the bu&s;hes and the bog for them&s;elves, all of them getting many falls in the attempt. The only alternative was to make a fire upon the &s;pot; but the &s;now which had fallen, and was &s;till falling, be&s;ides what was every moment &s;haken in flakes from the trees, rendered it equally impracticable, to kindle one there, and to bring any part of that which had been kindled in the wood thither: they were, therefore, reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the unhappy wretches to their fate; having fir&s;t made them a bed of boughs from the trees, and &s;pread a covering of the &s;ame kind over them to a con&s;iderable height.</P>
<P>Having now been expo&s;ed to the cold and the &s;now near an hour and an half, &s;ome of the re&s;t began to lo&s;e their &s;en&s;ibility; and one Bri&s;coe, another of Mr. Banks's &s;ervants, was &s;o ill, that it was thought he mu&s;t die before he could be got to the fire.</P>
<P>At the fire, however, at length they arrived; and pa&s;&s;ed the night in a &s;ituation, which, however dreadful in it&s;elf, was rendered more afflicting by the remembrance of what was pa&s;t, and the uncertainty of what was to come. Of twelve, the number that &s;et out together in health and &s;pirits, two were &s;uppo&s;ed to be already dead; a third was &s;o ill, that it was very doubtful whether he would be able to go forward in the mor|ning; and a fourth, Mr. Buchan, was in danger of a return of his fits, by fre&s;h fatigue after &s;o uncomfortable a night: they were di&s;tant from the &s;hip a long day's journey, through path|le&s;s woods, in which it was too probable they might be bewil|dered till they were overtaken by the next night; and, not having prepared for a journey of more than eight or ten hours, they were wholly de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, except a vulture, which they happened to &s;hoot while they were out, and which, if equally divided, would not afford each of them half a meal; and they knew not how much more they might &s;uffer from the cold, as the &s;now &s;till continued to fall. A dreadful te&s;timony of the &s;everity of the climate, as it was now the mid&s;t of &s;ummer in this part of the world, the twenty-fir&s;t of December being here the longe&s;t day; and every thing might ju&s;tly be dreaded from a phaenomenon which in the corre&s;ponding &s;ea&s;on, is unknown even in Norway and Lapland.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="013324_0060_0F90F103C378A430">
When the morning dawned, they &s;aw nothing round them, as far as the eve could reach, but &s;now, which &s;eemed to lie as think upon the trees as upon the ground; and the bla&s;ts returned &s;o frequently, and with &s;uch violence, that they found it im|po&s;&s;ible for them to &s;et out: how long this might la&s;t they knew not, and they had but too much rea&s;on to apprehend that it would confine them in that de&s;olate fore&s;t till they peri&s;hed with hunger and cold.</P>
<P>After having &s;uffered the mi&s;ery and terror of this &s;ituation till &s;ix o'clock in the morning, they conceived &s;ome hope of deliverance by di&s;covering the place of the &s;un through the clouds, which were become thinner, and began to break away. Their fir&s;t care was to &s;ee whether the poor wretches whom they had been obliged to leave among the bu&s;hes were yet alive; three of the company were di&s;patched for that purpo&s;e, and very &s;oon afterwards returned with the melancholy news, that they were dead.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the flattering appearance of the &s;ky, the &s;now &s;till continued to fall &s;o thick that they could not venture out upon their journey to the &s;hip; but about 8 o'clock a &s;mall regular breeze &s;prung up, which, with the prevailing influence of the &s;un, at length cleared the air; and they &s;oon after, with great joy, &s;aw the &s;now fall in large flakes from the trees, a certain &s;ign of an approaching thaw: they now examined more critically the &s;tate of their invalids; Bri&s;coe was &s;till very ill, but &s;aid, that he thought him&s;elf able to walk; and Mr. Bu|chan was much better than either he or his friends had any rea&s;on to expect. They were now, however, pre&s;&s;ed by the calls of hunger, to which, after long fa&s;ting, every con&s;ideration of future good or evil immediately gives way. Before they &s;et forward, therefore, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that they &s;hould eat their vulture; the bird was accordingly &s;kinned, and, it being thought be&s;t to divide it before it was fit to be eaten, it was cut into ten portions, and every man cooked his own as he thought fit. After this repa&s;t, which furni&s;hed each of them with about three mouthfuls, they prepared to &s;et out; but it was ten o'clock before the &s;now was &s;ufficiently gone off to render a march practicable. After a walk of about three hours, they were very agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find them&s;elves upon the beach, and much nearer to the &s;hip tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> they had any rea&s;on to expect. Upon reviewing their track from the ve&s;&s;el, they perceived, that, in&s;tead of a&s;cending the hill in a line, &s;o as to penetrate into the country, they had made almo&s;t a circle round it.&mdash;When they came on board, they congratulated each other upon their &s;afety, with a joy that no man can feel who has not been expo&s;ed to equal danger; and as I had &s;uffered great anxiety at their not returning in the evening of the day on which they &s;et out, I was not wholly without my &s;hare.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Pa&s;&s;age through the Streight of Le Maire, and a further De|&s;cription of the Inhabitants of Terra del Fuego, and its Productions.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 18th and 19th, we were delayed in getting on board our wood and water by a &s;well: but on the 20th, the weather being more moderate, we again &s;ent the boat on &s;hore, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went in it. They landed in the bottom of the bay, and while my people were employed in cutting brooms, they pur&s;ued their great object, the improve|ment of natural knowledge, with &s;ucce&s;s, collecting many &s;hells and plants which hitherto have been altogether unknown: they came on board to dinner, and afterwards went again on &s;hore to vi&s;it an Indian town, which &s;ome of the people had reported to lie about two miles up the country. They found the di&s;tance not more than by the account, and they approached it by what appeared to be the common road, yet they were above an hour in getting thither, for they were frequently up to their knees in mud; when they got within a &s;mall di&s;tance, two of the people came out to meet them, with &s;uch &s;tate as they could a&s;&s;ume; when they joined them, they began to hollow as they had done on board the &s;hip, without addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves either to the &s;trangers or their companions; and having continued this &s;trange vociferation &s;ome time, they conducted them to the town. It was &s;ituated on a dry knoll, or &s;mall hill, covered with wood, none of which &s;eemed to have been cleared away, and con&s;i&s;ted of about twelve or fourteen hovels, of the mo&s;t rude and inartifi|cial &s;tructure that can be imagined. They were nothing more than a few poles &s;et up &s;o as to incline towards each other, and meet at the top, forming a kind of a cone, like &s;ome of our bee|hives: on the weather &s;ide they were covered with a few boughs, and a little gra&s;s; and on the lee &s;ide about one eighth of the circle was left open, both for a door and a fire place; and of this kind were the huts that had been &s;een in St. Vincent's bay, in one of which the embers of a fire were &s;till remaining. Fur|niture they had none; a little gra&s;s, which lay round the in&s;ide of the hovel, &s;erved both for chairs and beds; and of all the uten&s;ils which nece&s;&s;ity and ingenuity have concurred to produce among other &s;avage nations, they &s;aw only a ba&s;ket to carry in the hand, a &s;atchel to hang at the back, and the bladder of &s;ome bea&s;t to hold water, which the natives drink through a hole that is made near the top for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this town were a &s;mall tribe, not more than fifty in number, of both &s;exes and of every age. Their colour re&s;embles that of the ru&s;t of iron mixed with oil, and they have long black hair: the men are large, but clum&s;ily built; their &s;tature is from five feet eight, to five feet ten; the women are much le&s;s, few of them being more than five feet
<PB N="35" REF="013324_0062_0F90F105345C4048">
high. Their whole apparel con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;kin of a guanicoe or &s;eal, which is thrown over their &s;houlders, exactly in the &s;tate in which it came from the animal's back; a piece of the &s;ame &s;kin, which is drawn over their feet, and gathered about the ancles like a pur&s;e, and a &s;mall &s;lap, which is worn by the women as a &s;uccedaneum for a figleaf. The men wear their cloak open, the women tie it about their wai&s;t with a thong. But although they are content to be naked, they are very am|bitious to be fine. There faces were painted in various forms: the region of the eye was in general white, and the re&s;t of the face adorned with horizontal &s;treaks of red and black; yet &s;carcely any two were exactly alike. This decoration &s;eems to be more profu&s;e and elaborate upon particular occa&s;ions, for the two Gentlemen who introduced Mr. Banks and the Doctor into the town, were almo&s;t covered with &s;treaks of black in all di|rections, &s;o as to make a very &s;triking appearance. Both men and women wore bracelets of &s;uch beads as they could make them&s;elves of &s;mall &s;hells or bones; the women both upon their wri&s;ts and ancles, the men upon their wri&s;ts only; but to com|pen&s;ate for the want of bracelets on their legs, they wore a kind of fillet of brown wor&s;ted round their heads. They &s;eemed to &s;et a particular value upon any thing that was red, and pre|ferred beads even to a knife or a hatchet.</P>
<P>Their language in general is guttural, and they expre&s;s &s;ome of their words by a &s;ound exactly like that which we make to clear the throat when any thing happens to ob&s;truct it; yet they have words which would be deemed &s;oft in the better languages of Europe. Mr. Banks learnt what he &s;uppo&s;es to be their name for beads and water. When they wanted beads, in&s;tead of ribbons or other trifles, they &s;aid <HI>hall&ebreve;c&abreve;;</HI> and when they were taken on &s;hore from the &s;hip, and by &s;igns a&s;ked where water might be found, they made the &s;ign of drinking, and pointing as well to the ca&s;ks as the watering place, cried <HI>Ood&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;aw no appearance of their having any food but &s;hell|fi&s;h; for though &s;eals were frequently &s;een near the &s;hore, they &s;eemed to have no implements for taking them. The &s;hell|fi&s;h is collected by the women, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;eems to be to attend at low water, with a ba&s;ket in one hand, a &s;tick, pointed and barbed, in the other, and a &s;atchel at heir backs: they loo&s;en the limpets, and other fi&s;h that adhere to the rocks, with the &s;tick, and put them into the ba&s;ket; which, when full, they empty into the &s;atchel.</P>
<P>The only things that we found among them in which there was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> appearance of neatne&s;s or ingenuity, were their weapons, which con&s;i&s;ted of a bow and arrows. The bow was not inelegantly made, and the arrows were the neare&s;t that we had ever &s;een: they were of wood, poli&s;hed to the highe&s;t degree; and the point, which was of gla&s;s or flint, and barbed,
<PB N="36" REF="013324_0063_0F90F1055B7FBBE0">
was formed and fitted with wonderful dexterity. We &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome pieces of gla&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">int among them unwrought, be&s;ides rings, buttons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and canva&s;s, with other European com|modities; they mu&s;t therefore &s;ometimes travel to the north|ward, for it is many years &s;ince any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> has been &s;o tar &s;outh as this part of Terra del <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. We ob&s;erved al&s;o, that they &s;hewed no &s;urpri&s;e to our fire-arms, with the u&s;e of which they appeared to be well acquainted; for they made &s;igns to Mr. Banks to &s;hoot a &s;eal which followed the boat as they were going on &s;hore from the &s;hip.</P>
<P>M. de Bougainville, who, in January 1768, ju&s;t one year before us, had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hore upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in latitude 53&deg; 40: 41, had, among other things, given gla&s;s to the people whom he found here; for he &s;ays, that a boy about twelve years old took it into his head to eat &s;ome of it: by this unhappy acci|dent he died in great mi&s;ery; but the endeavours of the good father, the French <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> were more &s;ucce&s;sful than tho&s;e of the Surgeon; for though the Surgeon could not &s;ave his life, the charitable Prie&s;t found means to &s;teal a Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m upon him &s;o &s;ecretly, that none of his Pagan relations knew any thing of the matter. The&s;e people might probably have &s;ome of the very gla&s;s which Bougainville left behind him, either from other natives, or perhaps from him&s;elf; for they appeared rather to be a travelling hord, than to have any fixed habitation. Their hou&s;es are built to &s;tand but for a &s;hort time, they have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;il or furniture but the ba&s;ket and fatchel, which have been mentioned before, and which have handles adapted to the carrying them about, in the hand and upon the back; the only cloathing they had here was &s;carcely &s;ufficient to prevent their peri&s;hing with cold in the &s;ummer of this country, much le&s;s is the extreme &s;everity of winter; the &s;hell-fi&s;h which &s;eems to be their only food mu&s;t &s;oon be ex|hau&s;ted at any one place; and we had &s;een hou&s;es upon what appeared to be a de&s;erted &s;tation in St. Vincent's bay.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o probable that the place where we found them was only a temporary re&s;idence, from their having here nothing like a boat a can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, of which it can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed that they were wholly de&s;titute, e&s;pecially as they were not &s;ea-&s;ick, or particularly affected, either in our boat or on board the &s;hip. We conjectured that there might be a &s;treight or inlet, running from the &s;ea through great part of this i&s;land, from the Streight of Magellan, whence the&s;e people might come, leaving their canoes where &s;uch inlet terminated.</P>
<P>They did not appear to have among them any government or &s;ubordination: none was more re&s;pected than another; yet they &s;eemed to live together in the utmo&s;t harmony and good fellow&s;hip. Neither did we di&s;cover any appearance of religion among them, except the noi&s;es which have been mentioned,
<PB N="37" REF="013324_0064_0F904D846AE268A8">
and which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;uper&s;titious ceremony, merely becau&s;e we could refer them to nothing el&s;e: they were u&s;ed only by one of tho&s;e who came on board the &s;hip, and the two who conducted Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to the town, whom we therefore conjectured to be prie&s;ts. Upon the whole, the&s;e people appeared to be the mo&s;t de&s;titute and forlorn, as well as the mo&s;t &s;tupid of all human beings; the outca&s;ts of Nature, who &s;pent their lives in wandering about the dreary wa&s;tes, where two of our people peri&s;hed with cold in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer; with no dwelling but a wretched hovel of &s;ticks and gra&s;s, which would not only admit the wind, but the &s;now and the rain; almo&s;t naked; and de&s;titute of every convenience that is furni&s;hed by the rude&s;t art, having no implement even to dre&s;s their food: yet they were content. They &s;eemed to have no wi&s;h for any thing more than they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, nor did any thing that we offered them appear acceptable but beads, as an ornamental &s;uper&s;tuity of life. What bodily pain they might &s;uffer from the &s;everities of their winter we could not know; but it is certain, that they &s;uffered nothing from the want of the innumerable articles which we con&s;ider, not as luxuries and conveniencies only, but the nece&s;&s;aries of life: as their de&s;ires are few, they probably enjoy them all; and how much they may be gainers by an exemption from the care, labour and &s;o|licitude, which ari&s;e from a perpetual and un&s;ucce&s;sful effort to gratify that infinite variety of de&s;ires which the refinements of artificial life have produced among us, is not very ea&s;y to de|termine: po&s;&s;ibly this may counterbalance all the real di&s;ad|vantages of their &s;ituation in compari&s;on with ours, and make the &s;cales by which good and evil are di&s;tributed to man, hang even between us.</P>
<P>In this place we &s;aw no quadruped except &s;eals, &s;ea-lions, and dogs; of the dogs it is remarkable that they bark, which tho&s;e that are originally bred in America do not. And this is a further proof, that the people we &s;aw here had, either imme|diately or remotely, communicated with the inhabitants of Europe. There are, however, other quadrupeds in this part of the country; for when Mr. Banks was at the top of the highe&s;t hill that he a&s;cended in his expedition through the woods, he &s;aw the foot&s;teps of a large bea&s;t imprinted upon the &s;urface of a bog, though he could not with any probability gue&s;s of what kind it might be.</P>
<P>Of land-birds there are but few; Mr. Banks &s;aw none larger than an Engli&s;h blackbird, except &s;ome hawks and a vulture; but of water-fowl there is great plenty, particularly ducks. Of fi&s;h we &s;aw &s;carce any, and with our hooks could catch none that was fit to eat; but &s;hell-fi&s;h, limpets, clams, and mu&s;cles were to be found in abundance.</P>
<P>Among the in&s;ects, which were not numerous, there was
<PB N="38" REF="013324_0065_0F904D8566789E18">
neither gnat nor mu&s;quito, nor any other &s;pecies that was either hurtful or trouble&s;ome, which perhaps is more than can be &s;aid of any other uncleared country. During the &s;now-bla&s;ts, which happened every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay while we were here, they hide them&s;elves; and the moment it is fair they appear again, as nimble and vigorous as the warme&s;t weather could make them.</P>
<P>Of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ants, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander found a va&s;t variety; the far greater part wholly different from any that have been hitherto de&s;cribed. Be&s;ides the birch, and winter's bark, which have been mentioned already, there is the beach, <HI>Fagus an|tarcticus,</HI> which as well as the birch, may be u&s;ed for timber. The plants cannot be enumerated here; but as the &s;curvy-gra&s;s, <HI>Cardamine anti&s;corbutica,</HI> and the wild celery, <HI>Apium antarcti|cum,</HI> probably contain anti&s;corbutic qualities, which may be of great benefit to the crews of &s;uch &s;hips as &s;hall hereafter touch at this place, the following &s;hort de&s;cription is in&s;erted:</P>
<P>The &s;curvy-gra&s;s will be found in plenty in damp places near &s;prings of water, and in general in all places that lie near the beach, e&s;pecially at the watering-place in the Bay of Good Succe&s;s: when it is young, the &s;tate of its greate&s;t perfection, it lies flat upon the ground, having many leaves of a bright green, &s;tanding in pairs oppo&s;ite to each other, with a &s;ingle one at the end, which generally makes the fifth upon a foot &s;talk: the plant, pa&s;&s;ing from this &s;tate, &s;hoots up in &s;talks that are &s;ometimes two feet high, at the top of which are &s;mall white blo&s;&s;oms, and the&s;e are &s;ucceeded by long pods: the whole plant greatly re&s;embles that which in England is called Lady's &s;mock, or Cuckow-flower. The wild celery is very like the celery in our gardens, the flowers are white, and &s;tand in the &s;ame manner, in &s;mall tufts at the top of the branches, but the leaves are of a deeper green. It grows in great abundance near the beach, and generally upon the &s;oil that lies next above the &s;pring tides. It may indeed ea&s;ily be known by the ta&s;te, which is between that of celery and par&s;ley. We u&s;ed the celery in large quantities, particularly in our &s;oup, which, thus me|dicated, produced the &s;ame good effects which &s;eamen generally derive from a vegetable diet, after having been long confined to &s;alt provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>On Sunday, the 22d of January, about two o'clock in the morning, having got our wood and water on board, we &s;ailed out of the Bay, and continued our cour&s;e through the Streight.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A general De&s;cription of the S. E. part of Terra del Fuego, and the Streight of Le Maire; with &s;ome Remarks on Lord An&s;on's Account of them, and Directions for the Pa&s;&s;age We&s;tward, round this Part of America, into the South Seas.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST all writers who have mentioned the i&s;land of Terra del Fuego, de&s;cribe it as de&s;titute of wood, and
<PB N="39" REF="013324_0066_0F904D85F28F8AE0">
covered with &s;now. In the winter it may po&s;&s;ibly be covered with &s;now, and tho&s;e who &s;aw it at that &s;ea&s;on might perhaps be ea&s;ily deceived, by its appearance, into an opinion that it was de&s;titute of wood. Lord An&s;on was there in the beginning of March, which an&s;wers to our September; and we were there the beginning of January, which an&s;wers to our July, which may account for the difference of his de&s;cription of it from ours. We fell in with it about twenty-one leagues to the we&s;tward of the Streight of Le Maire, and from the time that we fir&s;t &s;aw it, trees were plainly to be di&s;tingui&s;hed with our gla&s;&s;es; and as we came nearer, though here and there we di&s;covered patches of &s;now, the &s;ides of the hills and the &s;ea|coa&s;t appeared to be covered with a beautiful verdure. The hills are lofty, but not mountainous, though the &s;ummits of them are quite naked. The &s;oil in the valleys is rich, and of a con&s;iderable depth; and at the foot of almo&s;t every hill there is a brook, the water of which has a reddi&s;h hue, like that which runs through our turf bogs in England, but it is by no means ill ta&s;ted, and upon the whole proved to be the be&s;t that we took in during our voyage. We ranged the coa&s;t to the Streight, and had &s;oundings all the way from 40 to 20 fathom, upon a gravelly and &s;andy bottom. The mo&s;t remarkable land on Terra del Fuego is a hill, in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf, which &s;tands on the we&s;t &s;ide not far from the &s;ea; and the three hills, called the three brothers, about nine miles to the we&s;tward of Cape St. Diego, the low point that forms the north entrance of the Streight of Le Maire.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in the account of Lord An&s;on's voyage, that it is difficult to determine exactly where the Streight lies, though the appearance of Terra del Fuego be well known, without know|ing al&s;o the appearance of Staten Land; and that &s;ome navi|gators have been deceived by three hills on Staten Land, which have been mi&s;taken for the three brothers on Terra del Fuego, and &s;o over-&s;hot the Streight. But no &s;hip can po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;s the Streight that coa&s;ts Terra del Fuego within &s;ight of land, for it will then, of it&s;elf, be &s;ufficiently con&s;picuous; and Staten Land, which forms the ea&s;t &s;ide, will be &s;till more manife&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed, for there is no land on Terra del Fuego like it. The Streight of Le Maire can be mi&s;&s;ed only by &s;tanding too far to the ea&s;tward, without keeping the land of Terra del Fuego in &s;ight: if this is done, it may be mi&s;&s;ed, however ac|curately the appearance of the coa&s;t of Staten Land may have been exhibited; and if this is not done, it cannot be mi&s;&s;ed, though the appearance of that coa&s;t be not known. The en|trance of the Streight &s;hould not be attempted but with a fair wind and moderate weather, and upon the very beginning of the tide of flood, which happens here, at the full and change of the moon, about one or two o'clock; it is al&s;o be&s;t to keep as near to the Terra del Fuego &s;hore as the winds will admit.
<PB N="40" REF="013324_0067_0F90F10616D3AC78">
By attending to the&s;e particulars, a &s;hip may be got quite through the Streight in one tide; or, at lea&s;t, to the &s;outhward of Succe&s;s Bay, into which it will be more prudent to put, if the wind &s;hould be &s;outherly, than to attempt the weathering of Staten Land with a lee wind and a current, which may endanger her being driven on that i&s;land.</P>
<P>The Streight it&s;elf, which is bounded on the we&s;t by Terra del Fuego, and on the ca&s;t by the we&s;t end of Staten Land, is about five leagues long, and as many broad. The Bay of Good Succe&s;s lies about the middle of it, on the Terra del Fuego &s;ide, and is di&s;covered immediately upon entering the Streight from the northward; and the &s;outh head of it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a mark on the land, that has the appearance of a broad road, leading up from the &s;ea into the country: at the entrance it is half a league wide, and runs in we&s;tward about two miles and an half. There is good anchorage in every part of it, in from ten to &s;even fathom, clear ground; and it affords plenty of ex|ceeding good wood and water. The tides flow in the Bay, at the full and change of the moon, about four or five o'clock, and ri&s;e about five or &s;ix feet perpendicular. But the flood runs two or three hours longer in the Streight than in the Bay; and the ebb, or northerly current, runs with near double the &s;trength of the flood.</P>
<P>In the appearance of Staten Land, we did not di&s;cover the wildne&s;s and horror that is a&s;cribed to it in the account of Lord An&s;on's voyage. On the north &s;ide are the appearances of bays or harbours; and the land, when we &s;aw it, was neither de&s;titute of wood nor verdure, nor covered with &s;now. The i&s;land &s;eems to be about twelve leagues in length, and five broad.</P>
<P>On the we&s;t &s;ide of the Cape of Good Succe&s;s, which forms the S. W. entrance of the Streight, lies Valentine's Bay, of which we only &s;aw the entrance; from this bay the land trends away to the W. S. W. for twenty or thirty leagues; it appears to be high and mountainous, and forms &s;everal bays and inlets.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of fourteen leagues from the bay of Good Succe&s;s, in the direction of S. W. &frac12; W. and between two and three leagues from the &s;hore, lies New I&s;land It is about two leagues in length from N. E. to S. W. and terminates to the N. E. in a remarkable hillock. At the di&s;tance of &s;even leagues from New I&s;land, in the direction of S. W. lies the i&s;le <HI>Evouts;</HI> and a little to the we&s;t of the &s;outh of this i&s;land lie Barnevelt's two &s;mall flat i&s;lands, clo&s;e to each other; they are partly &s;ur|rounded with rocks, which ri&s;e to different heights above the water, and lie twenty-four leagues from the Streight of Le Maire. At the di&s;tance of three leagues from Barnevelt's i&s;lands, in the direction of S. W. by S. lies the S. E. point of Hermit's i&s;lands: the&s;e i&s;lands lie S. E. and N. W. and are pretty high: from mo&s;t points of view they will be taken for one i&s;land, or a part of the main.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="013324_0068_0F90F106B394C9C8">
From the S. E. point of Hermit's i&s;lands to Cape Horn the cour&s;e is S. W. by S. di&s;tance three leagues.</P>
<P>The appearance of this Cape and Hermit's i&s;lands is repre|&s;ented in the chart of this coa&s;t, from our fir&s;t making land to the Cape, which includes the Streight of Le Maire, and part of Staten Land. In this chart I have laid down no land, nor traced out any &s;hore but what I &s;aw my&s;elf, and thus far it may be depended upon: the bays and inlets, of which we &s;aw only the openings, are not traced; it can, however, &s;carcely be doubted, but that mo&s;t, if not all of them, afford anchorage, wood and water. The Dutch &s;quadron, commanded by Hermit, certainly put into &s;ome of them in the year 1624; and it was Chapenham, the Vice Admiral of this &s;quadron, who fir&s;t di&s;|covered that the land of Cape Horn con&s;i&s;ted of a number of i&s;lands. The account, however, which tho&s;e who &s;ailed in Hermit's fleet have given of the&s;e parts is extremely defective; and tho&s;e of Schouton and Le Maire are &s;till wor&s;e: it is there|fore no wonder that the charts hitherto publi&s;hed &s;hould be erroneus, not only in laying down the land, but in the latitude and longitude of the places they contain. I will, however, venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the longitude of few parts of the world is better a&s;certained than that of the Streight of Le Maire, and Cape Horn, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hart now offered to the public, as it was laid down by &s;everal ob&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, that were made both by my&s;elf and Mr. Green.</P>
<P>The variation of the compa&s;s on this coa&s;t I found to be from 23&deg; to 25&deg; E. except near Barnevelt's i&s;lands and Cape Horn, where we found it le&s;s, and un&s;ettled; probably it is di&s;turbed here by the land, as Hermit's &s;quadron, in this very place found all their compa&s;&s;es differ from each other. The declina|tion of the dipping-needle, when &s;et up on &s;hore in Succe&s;s Bay, was 68&deg; 15 below the horizon.</P>
<P>Between Streight Le Maire and Cape Horn, we found a current &s;etting, generally very &s;trong, to the N. E. when we were in with the &s;hore; but lo&s;t it when we were at the di&s;tance of fifteen or twenty leagues.</P>
<P>On the 26th of January, we took our departure from Cape Horn, which lies in latitude 55&deg; 53:S. longitude 68&deg; 13:W. The farthe&s;t &s;outhern latitude that we made was 60&deg; 10:, our longitude was then 74&deg; 30:W.; and we found the variation of the compa&s;s, by the mean of eighteen azimuths, to be 27&deg; 9:E. As the weather was frequently calm, Mr. Banks went out in a &s;mall boat to &s;hoot birds, among which were &s;ome al|batro&s;&s;es and &s;heerwaters. The albatro&s;&s;es were ob&s;erved to be larger than tho&s;e which had been taken northward of the Streight; one of them mea&s;ured ten feet two inches from the tip of one wing to that of the other, when they were extended: the &s;heer|water, on the contrary, is le&s;s, and darker coloured on the
<PB N="42" REF="013324_0069_0F90F107805F3318">
back. The albatro&s;&s;es we &s;kinned, and having &s;oaked them in &s;alt water till the morning, we parboiled them, then throwing away the liquor, &s;tewed them in a very little fre&s;h water till they were tender, and had them &s;erved up with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avoury &s;auce; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s dre&s;&s;ed, the di&s;h was univer&s;ally commended, and we eat of it very heartily even when there was fre&s;h pork upon the table.</P>
<P>From a variety of ob&s;ervations which were made with great care, it appeared probable in the highe&s;t degree, that, from the time of our leaving the land to the 13th of February, when we were in latitude 49&deg; 32:, and longitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0&deg; 37:. we had no current to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>At this time we had advanced about 12&deg; to the we&s;tward, and 3 and &frac12; to the northward of the Streight of Magellan: having been ju&s;t three and thirty days in coming round the land of Torra del Fuego, or Cape Horn, from the ea&s;t entrance of the Streight to this &s;ituation. And though the doubling of Cape Horn is &s;o much dreaded, that, in the general opinion, it is more eligible to pa&s;s through the Streight of Magellan, we were not once brought under our clo&s;e reef'd top&s;ails after we left the Streight of Le Maire. The Dolphin in her la&s;t voyage, which &s;he performed at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year with ours, was three months in getting through the Streight of Ma|gellan, exclu&s;ive of the time that &s;he lay in Port Famine; and I am per&s;uaded, from the winds we had, that if we had come by that pa&s;&s;age, we &s;hould not at this time have been in the&s;e &s;eas; that our people would have been fatigued, and our anchors, cables, &s;ails and rigging much damaged; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">her of which in|conveniencies we had now &s;uffered. But &s;uppo&s;ing it more eligible to go around the Cape, than through the Streight of Magellan; it may &s;till be que&s;tioned, whether it is better to go through the Streight of Le Maire, or &s;tand to the ea&s;tward, and go round Staten Land. The advice given in the Account of Lord An&s;on's voyage is, <Q>That all &s;hips bound to the South Seas, in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing through the Streight of Le Maire, &s;hould con&s;tantly pa&s;s to the ea&s;tward of Staten Land, and &s;hould be invariably bent on running to the &s;outhward as far as the latitude of 61 or 62 degrees, before they endea|vour to &s;tand to the we&s;tward.</Q> But, in my opinion, dif|ferent circum&s;tances may at one time render it eligible to pa&s;s through the Streight, and to keep to the ea&s;tward of Staten Land at another. If the land is fallen in with to the we&s;tward of the Streight, and the wind is favourable for going through, I think it would be very injudicious to lo&s;e time by going ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Staten Land, as I am confident that, by attending to the di|rections which I have given, the Streight may be pa&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t &s;afety and convenience: but if, on the contrary, the land is fallen in with to the ea&s;tward of the Streight, and the wind &s;hould prove tempe&s;tuous or unfavourable, I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="43" REF="013324_0070_0F90F10843D4E178">
would be be&s;t to go round Staten Land. But I cannot in any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the running into the latitude of 61 or 62, before any endeavour is made to i&s;land to the we&s;tward.

<P>ON the 1&s;t of March, we were in latitude 38&deg; 44 S. and longitude 110&deg; 33 W. both by ob&s;ervation and by the log. This agreement, after a run of 660 leagues, was thought to be very extraordinary; and is a demon&s;tration, that after we left the land of Cape Horn we had no current that affected the &s;hip. It renders it al&s;o highly probable, that we had been near no land of any con&s;iderable extent; for currents are always found when land is not remote, and &s;ometimes, particularly on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the continent in the North Sea, when land has been di&s;tant 100 leagues.</P>
<P>Many birds, as u&s;ual, were con&s;tantly about the &s;hip, &s;o that Mr. Banks killed no le&s;s than 62 in one day; and what is more remarkable, be caught two fore&s;t flies, both of them of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but different from any that have hitherto been de|&s;cribed; the&s;e probably belonged to the birds, and came with them from the land, which we judged to be at a great di&s;tance. Mr. Banks al&s;o, about this time, found a large cuttle-fi&s;h, which had ju&s;t been killed by the birds, floating in a mangled condition upon the water; it was very different from the cuttle-fi&s;hes that are found in the European &s;eas; for its arms, in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, were furni&s;hed with a double row of very &s;harp

talons, which re&s;embled tho&s;e of a cat, and, like them, were retractable into a &s;heath of &s;kin, from which they might be thru&s;t at plea&s;ure. Of this cuttle-fi&s;h we made one of the be&s;t &s;oups we had ever ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The albatro&s;&s;es now began to leave us, and after the 8th there was not one to be &s;een. We continued our cour&s;e without any memorable event till the 24th, when &s;ome of the people who were upon the watch in the night, reported that they &s;aw a log of wood pa&s;s by the &s;hip; and that the &s;ea, which was rather rough, became &s;uddenly as &s;mooth as a mill-pond. It was a general opinion, that there was land to windward; but I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to &s;earch for what I was not &s;ure to find; though I judged we were not far from the i&s;lands that were di&s;covered by Quiros in 1606. Our latitude was 22&deg; 11. S. and longitude 127&deg; 55 W.</P>
<P>On the 25th, about noon, one of the marines, a young fellow about twenty, was placed as centry at the cabbin door; while he was upon this duty, one of my &s;ervants was at the &s;ame place preparing to cut a piece of &s;eal-&s;kin into tobacco-pouches: he had promi&s;ed one to &s;everal of the men, but had refu&s;ed one to this young fellow, though he had a&s;ked him &s;everal times; upon which he jocularly threatened to &s;teal one, if it &s;hould be in his power. It happened that the &s;ervant being called ha&s;tily away, gave the &s;kin in charge to the centinel, without regarding what had pa&s;&s;ed between them. The centi|nel immediately &s;ecured a piece of the &s;kin, which the other mi&s;&s;ing at his return, grew angry; but &s;ome altercation, con|tented him&s;elf with taking it away, declaring, that, for &s;o trifling an affair, he would not complain of him to the officers. But it happened that one of his fellow &s;oldiers, over-hearing the di&s;pute, came to the knowledge of what had happened, and told it to the re&s;t; who, taking it into their heads to &s;tand up for the honour of their corps, reproached the offender with great bitterne&s;s, and reviled him in the mo&s;t opprobrious terms; they exaggerated his offence into a crime of the deepe&s;t die; they &s;aid it was a theft by a centry when he was upon duty, and of a thing that had been committed to his tru&s;t; they declared it a di&s;grace to a&s;&s;ociate with him; and the Serjeant, in particular, &s;aid that, if the per&s;on from whom the &s;kin had been &s;tolen would not complain, he would complain him&s;elf; for that his honour would &s;uffer if the offender was not puni&s;hed. From the &s;coff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and reproaches of the&s;e men of honour, the poor young fellow retired to his hammock in an agony of confu&s;ion and &s;hame. The Serjeant &s;oon after went to him, and ordered him to follow him to the deck: he obeyed without reply; but it being in the du&s;k of the evening, he &s;lip|ped from the Serjeant and went forward: he was &s;een by &s;ome of the people, who thought he was gone to the head; but a &s;earch being made for him afterwards, it was found that he
<PB N="45" REF="013324_0072_0F90F109BB134698">
had thrown him&s;elf overboard; and I was then fir&s;t made ac|quainted with the theft and its circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of this man was the more regretted as he was re|markably quiet and indu&s;trious, and as the very action that put an end to his life was a proof of an ingenuous mind; for to &s;uch only di&s;grace is in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 4th of April, about ten o'clock in the morn|ing, Mr. Banks's &s;ervant, Peter Bri&s;coe, di&s;covered land, bear|ing &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of about three or four leagues. I immediately hauled up for it, and found it to be an i&s;land of an oval form, with a lagoon in the middle, which occupied much the larger part of it; the border of land which circum&s;cribes the lagoon is in many places very low and narrow, particularly on the &s;outh &s;ide, where it con&s;i&s;ts principally of a beach or reef of rocks: it has the &s;ame appearance al&s;o in three places on the north &s;ide; &s;o that, the firm land being disjoined, the whole looks like many i&s;lands covered with wood. On the we&s;t end of the i&s;land is a large tree, or clump of trees, that in appear|ance re&s;embles a tower; and about the middle are two cocoa|nut trees, which ri&s;e above all the re&s;t, and, as we came near to the i&s;land, appeared like a flag. We approached it on the north &s;ide, and though we came within a mile, we found no bottom with 130 fathom of line, nor did there appear to be any anchorage about it. The whole is covered with trees of different verdure, but we could di&s;tingui&s;h none, even with our gla&s;&s;es, except cocoa-nuts and palm-nuts. We &s;aw &s;everal of the natives upon the &s;hore, and counted four and twenty. They appeared to be tall, and to have heads remarkably large; perhaps they had &s;omething wound round them which we could not di&s;tingui&s;h; they were of a copper colour, and had long black hair. Eleven of them walked along the beach abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, with poles or pikes in their hands which reached twice as high as them&s;elves: while they walked on the beach they &s;eemed to be naked; but &s;oon after they retired, which they did as &s;oon as the &s;hip had pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land, they covered them&s;elves with &s;omething that made them appear of a light colour. Their habitations were under &s;ome clumps of palm-nut trees, which at a di&s;tance appeared like high ground; and to us, who for a long time had &s;een nothing but water and &s;ky, except the dreary hills of Terra del Fuego, the&s;e groves &s;eemed a terre&s;trial para|di&s;e. To this &s;pot, which lies in latitude 18&deg; 47 S. and lon|gitude 139&deg; 28 W. we gave the name of LAGOON ISLAND. The variation of the needle here is 2&deg; 54 E.</P>
<P>About one o'clock we made &s;ail to the we&s;tward, and about half an hour after three we &s;aw land again to the N. W. We got up with it at &s;un&s;et, and it proved to be a low woody i&s;land, of a circular form, and not much above a mile in compa&s;s. We di&s;covered no inhabitants, nor could we di&s;tingui&s;h any
<PB N="46" REF="013324_0073_0F90F10A97727CB8">
cocoa-nut trees, though we were within half a mile of the &s;hore. The land, however, was covered with verdure of many hues. It lies in latitude 18&deg; 35 S. and longitude 139&deg; 48 W. and is di&s;tant from Lagoon I&s;land, in the direction of N. 62 W. about &s;even leagues. We called it THRUMB-CAP. I di&s;covered, by the appearance of the &s;hore, that at this place it was low-water; and I had ob&s;erved at Lagoon I&s;land, that it was either high-water, or that the &s;ea neither ebbed nor flowed: I infer, therefore, that a S. by E. or S. moon makes high-water.</P>
<P>We went on with a fine trade-wind and plea&s;ant weather, and on the 5th, about three in the afternoon, we di&s;covered land to the we&s;tward. It proved to be a low i&s;land, of much greater extent than either of tho&s;e that we had &s;een before, being about ten or twelve leagues in compa&s;s. Several of us remained at the ma&s;t-head the whole evening, admiring its extraordinary figure: it was &s;haped exactly like a bow, the arch and cord of which were land, and the &s;pace between them water; the cord was a flat beach, without any &s;igns of vegetation, having nothing upon it but heaps of &s;ea weed, which lay in different ridges, as higher or low tides had left them. It appeared to be about three or four leagues long, and not more than two hundred yards wide; but as a horizontal plain is always &s;een in per|&s;pective, and greatly fore-&s;hortened, it is certainly much wider than it appeared: the horns, or extremities of the bow, were two large tufts of cocoa-nut trees; and much the greater part of the arch was covered with trees of different height, figure and hue; in &s;ome parts, however, it was naked and low like the cord: &s;ome of us thought they di&s;covered openings through the cord, into the pool, or lake, that was included between that and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e bow; but whether there were or were not &s;uch openings is uncertain. We &s;ailed abrea&s;t of the low beach, or bow|&s;tring, within le&s;s than a league of the &s;hore, till &s;un&s;et, and we then judged our&s;elves to be about half way between the two horns: here we brought to, and &s;ounded, but found no bottom with one hundred and thirty fathom; and, as it is dark almo&s;t in&s;tantly after &s;un&s;et in the&s;e latitudes, we &s;uddenly lo&s;t &s;ight of the land, and making &s;ail again, before the line was well hauled in, we &s;teered by the &s;ound of the breakers, which were di&s;tinctly heard till we got clear of the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>We knew this i&s;land to be inhabited, by &s;moke which we &s;aw in different parts of it, and we gave it the name of Bow ISLAND. Mr. Gore, my Second Lieutenant, &s;aid, after we had &s;ailed by the i&s;land, that he had &s;een &s;everal of the natives, under the fir&s;t clump of trees, from the deck; that he had di&s;|tingui&s;hed their hou&s;es, and &s;een &s;everal canoes hauled up under the &s;hade; but in this he was more fortunate than any other per&s;on on board. The ea&s;t end of this i&s;land, which from its figure we called the Bow, lies in latitude 18&deg; 23 S. and longi|tude
<PB N="47" REF="013324_0074_0F90F10B33E825A0">
141&deg; 12 W. we ob&s;erved the variation of the compa&s;s to be 5&deg; 38 E.</P>
<P>On the next day, Thur&s;day the 6th, about noon, we &s;aw land again to the we&s;tward, and came up with it about three. It appeared to be two i&s;lands, or rather groups of i&s;lands, ex|tending from N. W. by N. to S. E. by S. about nine leagues. Of the&s;e, the two large&s;t were &s;eparated from each other by a channel of about half a mile broad, and were &s;everally &s;urrounded by &s;maller i&s;lands, to which they were joined by reefs that lay under water.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands were long narrow &s;trips of land, ranging in all directions, &s;ome of them ten miles or upwards in length, but none more than a quarter of a mile broad, and upon all of them there were trees of various kinds, particularly the cocoa-nut. The &s;outh-ea&s;termo&s;t of them lies in the latitude of 18&deg; 12 S. and longitude 142&deg; 42 W, and at the di&s;tance of twenty-five leagues, in the direction of W. &frac12; N. from the we&s;t end of Bow I&s;land. We ranged along the S. W. &s;ide of this i&s;land, and hauled into a bay which lies to the N. W. of the &s;outhermo&s;t point of the Group, where there was a &s;mooth &s;ea, and the ap|pearance of anchorage, without much &s;urf on the &s;hore. We &s;ounded, but we found no bottom with one hundred fathom, at the di&s;tance of no more than three quarters of a mile from the beach, and I did not think it prudent to go nearer.</P>
<P>While this was doing, &s;everal of the inhabitants a&s;&s;embled upon the &s;hore, and &s;ome came out in their canoes as far as the reefs, but would not pa&s;s them: when we &s;aw this, we ranged, with an ea&s;y &s;ail, along the &s;hore; but ju&s;t as we were pa&s;&s;ing the end of the i&s;land, &s;ix men, who had for &s;ome time kept abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, &s;uddenly launched two canoes with great quickne&s;s and dexterity, and three of them getting into each, they put off, as we imagined with a de&s;ign to come on board us; the &s;hip therefore brought to, but they, like their fellows, &s;topped at the reef; we did not however immediately make &s;ail, as we ob&s;erved two me&s;&s;engers di&s;patched to them from the other canoes, which were of a much larger &s;ize: we per|ceived that the&s;e me&s;&s;engers made great expedition, wading and &s;wimming along the reef; at length they met, and the men on board the canoes making no di&s;po&s;itions to pa&s;s the reef, after having received the me&s;&s;age, we judged that they had re&s;olved to come no farther: after waiting, therefore, &s;ome little time longer, we &s;tood off; but when we were got about two or three miles from the &s;hore, we perceived &s;ome of the natives follow|ing us in a canoe with a &s;ail; we did not, however, think it worth while to wait for her, and though &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the reef, &s;he &s;oon after gave over the chace.</P>
<P>According to the be&s;t judgment that we could form of the people when we were neare&s;t the &s;hore, they were about our &s;ize,
<PB N="48" REF="013324_0075_0F90F10C1FB26528">
and well-made. They were of a brown complexion, and ap|peared to be naked; their hair, which was black, was confined by a fillet that went round the head, and &s;tuck out behind like a bu&s;h. The greater part of them carried in their hands two weapons; one of them was a &s;lender pole, from ten to fourteen feet long, on one end of which was a &s;mall knob, not unlike the point of a &s;pear; the other was about four feet long, and &s;haped like a paddle, and po&s;&s;ibly might be &s;o, for &s;ome of their canoes were very &s;mall: tho&s;e which we &s;aw them launch &s;eemed not intended to carry more than three men that got into them: we &s;aw others that had on board &s;ix or &s;even men, and one of them hoi&s;ted a &s;ail which did not &s;eem to reach more than &s;ix feet above the gunwale of the boat, and which, upon the falling of a &s;light &s;hower, was taken down and converted into an aw|ning or tilt. The canoe which followed us to &s;ea hoi&s;ted a &s;ail not unlike an Engli&s;h lug-&s;ail, and almo&s;t as lofty as an Engli&s;h boat of the &s;ame &s;ize would have carried.</P>
<P>The people, who kept abrea&s;t of the &s;hip on the beach, made many &s;ignals; but whether they were intended to frighten us away, or invite us on &s;hore, it is not ea&s;y to determine: we re|turned them by waving our hats and &s;houting, and they replied by &s;houting again. We did not put their di&s;po&s;ition to the te&s;t, by attempting to land; becau&s;e, as the i&s;land was incon&s;iderable, and as we wanted nothing that it could afford, we thought it imprudent as well as cruel to ri&s;k a conte&s;t, in which the natives mu&s;t have &s;uffered by our &s;uperiority, merely to gratify an idle curio&s;ity; e&s;pecially as we expected &s;oon to fall in with the i&s;land where we had been directed to make our a&s;tronomical ob|&s;ervation, the inhabitants of which would probably admit us without oppo&s;ition, as they were already acquainted with our &s;trength, and might al&s;o procure us a ready and peaceable re|ception among the neighbouring people, if we &s;hould de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>To the&s;e i&s;lands we gave the name of THE GROUPS.</P>
<P>On the 7th, about half an hour after &s;ix in the morning, being ju&s;t at day-break, we di&s;covered another i&s;land to the northward, which we judged to be about four miles in circum|ference. The land lay very low, and there was a piece of water in the middle of it; there &s;eemed to be &s;ome wood upon it, and it looked green and plea&s;ant; but we &s;aw neither cocoa trees nor inhabitants: it abounded however with birds, and we therefore gave it the name of BIRD-ISLAND.</P>
<P>It lies in latitude 17&deg; 48 S. and longitude 143&deg; 35 W. at the di&s;tance of ten leagues, in the direction W. &frac12; N. from the we&s;t end of the Groups. The variation here was 6&deg; 32 E.</P>
<P>On the 8th, about two o'clock in the afternoon, we &s;aw land to the northward, and about &s;un&s;et came abrea&s;t of it, at about the di&s;tance of two leagues. It appeared to be a double range of low woody i&s;lands joined together by reefs, &s;o as to form one
<PB N="49" REF="013324_0076_0F904D8757908820">
i&s;land, in the form of an ellip&s;is or oval, with a lake in the middle of it. The &s;mall i&s;lands and reefs that circum&s;cribe the lake have the appearance of a chain, and we therefore gave it the name of CHAIN ISLAND. Its length &s;eemed to be about five leagues, in the direction of N. W. and S. E. and its breadth about five miles. The trees upon it appeared to be large, and we &s;aw &s;moke ri&s;ing in different parts of it from among them, a certain &s;ign that it was inhabited. The middle of it lies in latitude 17&deg; 23 S. and longitude 145&deg; 54 W. and is di&s;tant from Bird I&s;land forty-five leagues in the direction of W. by N. The variation here was, by &s;everal azimuths, found to be 4&deg; 54 E.</P>
<P>On the 10th, having had a tempe&s;tuous night, with thunder and rain, the weather was hazy till about nine o'clock in the morning, when it cleared up, and we &s;aw the i&s;land to which Captain Wallis, who fir&s;t di&s;covered it, gave the name of O&s;|naburgh I&s;land, called by the natives <HI>Maitea,</HI> bearing N. W. by W. di&s;tant about five leagues. It is a high round i&s;land, not above a league in circuit; in &s;ome parts it is covered with trees, and in others a naked rock. In this direction it looked like a high crown'd hat; but when it bears North, the top of it has more the appearance of the roof of a hou&s;e. We made its latitude to be 17&deg; 48 S. its longitude 148&deg; 10 W. and its di&s;tance from Chain I&s;land 44 leagues, in the direction of W. by S.</P>

<P>ABOUT one o'clock, on Monday the 10th of April, &s;ome of the people who were looking out for the i&s;land to which we were bound, &s;aid they &s;aw land ahead, in that part of the horizon where it was expected to appear; but it was &s;o faint that, whether there was land in &s;ight or not, remained a matter of di&s;pute till &s;un&s;et. The next morning, however, at &s;ix o'clock, we were convinced that tho&s;e who &s;aid they had di&s;covered land, were not mi&s;taken; it appeared to be very high and mountainous, extending from W. by S. &frac12; S. to W. by N. &frac12; N. and we knew it to be the &s;ame that Captain Wallis had called King George the III.'s I&s;land. We were delayed in our approach to it by light airs and calms, &s;o that in the morning of the 12th we were but little nearer than we had been the night before; but about &s;even a breeze &s;prung up, and before eleven &s;everal canoes were &s;een making towards the &s;hip;
<PB N="50" REF="013324_0077_0F90F10CB2727978">
there were but few of them, however, that would come near; and the people in tho&s;e that did, could not be per&s;uaded to come on board. In every canoe there were young plantains, and branches of a tree which the Indians call <HI>E'Midho;</HI> the&s;e, as we afterwards learnt, were brought as tokens of peace and amity, and the people in one of the canoes handed them up the &s;hip's &s;ide, making &s;ignals at the &s;ame time with great earne&s;tne&s;s, which we did not immediately under&s;tand; at length we gue&s;&s;ed that they wi&s;hed the&s;e &s;ymbols &s;hould be placed in &s;ome con|&s;picuous part of the &s;hip; we, therefore, immediately &s;tuck them among the rigging, at which they expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;atis|faction. We then purcha&s;ed their cargoes, con&s;i&s;ting of cocoa-nuts, and various kinds of fruit, which after our long voyage were very acceptable.</P>
<P>We &s;tood on with an ea&s;y &s;ail all night, with &s;oundings from 22 fathom to 12, and about &s;even o'clock in the morning we came to an anchor in 13 fathom, in Port-royal bay, called by the natives <HI>Matavai.</HI> We were immediately &s;urrounded by the native in their canoes, who gave us cocoa-nuts, fruit re&s;embl|ing apples, bread-fruit, and &s;ome &s;mall fi&s;hes, in exchange for beads and other trifles. They had with them a pig, which they would not part with for any thing but a hatchet, and therefore we refu&s;ed to purcha&s;e it; becau&s;e, if we gave them a hatchet for a pig now, we knew they would never afterwards &s;ell one for le&s;s, and we could not afford to buy as many as it was pro|bable we &s;hould want at that price. The bread-fruit grows on a tree that is about the &s;ize of a middling oak: its leaves are frequently a foot and an half long, of an oblong &s;hape, deeply &s;inuated like tho&s;e of the fig-tree, which they re&s;emble in con|&s;i&s;tence and colour, and in the exuding of a white milky juice upon being broken. The fruit is about the &s;ize and &s;hape of a child's head, and the &s;urface is reticulated not much unlike a truffle: it is covered with a thin &s;kin, and has a core about as big as the handle of a &s;mall knife: the eatable part lies between the &s;kin and the core; it is as white as &s;now, and &s;omewhat of the con&s;i&s;tence of new bread: it mu&s;t be roa&s;ted before it is eaten, being fir&s;t divided into three or four parts: its ta&s;te is in&s;ipid, with a &s;light &s;weetne&s;s &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of the crumb of wheaten-bread mixed with a Jeru&s;alem artichoke.</P>
<P>Among others who came off to the &s;hip was an elderly man, who&s;e name, as we learnt afterwards, was OWHAW, and who was immediately known to Mr. Gore, and &s;everal others who had been here with Captain Wallis; as I was informed that he had been very u&s;eful to them, I took him on board the &s;hip with &s;ome others, and was particularly attentive to gratify him, as I hoped he might al&s;o be u&s;eful to us.</P>
<P>As our &s;tay here was not likely to be very &s;hort, and as it was nece&s;&s;ary that the merchandi&s;e which we had brought for traffic

<P>As &s;oon as the &s;hip was properly &s;ecured, I went on &s;hore with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, a party of men under arms, and our friend Owhaw. We were received from the boat by &s;ome hundreds of the inhabitants, who&s;e looks at lea&s;t gave us welcome, though they were &s;truck with &s;uch awe, that the fir&s;t who approached us crouched &s;o low that he almo&s;t crept upon his hands and knees. It is remarkable that he, like the people in the canoes, pre&s;ented to us the &s;ame &s;ymbol of peace that is known to have been in u&s;e among the ancient and mighty na|tions of the northern hemi&s;phere, the green branch of a tree. We received it with looks and ge&s;tures of kindne&s;s and &s;atis|faction; and ob&s;erving that each of them held one in his hand, we immediately gathered every one a bough, and carried it in our hands in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="013324_0079_0F90F10E4A411388">
They marched with us about half a mile towards the place where the Dolphin had watered, conducted by Owhaw; they then made a full &s;top, and having laid the ground bare, by clearing away all the plants that grew upon it, the principal per&s;ons among them threw their green branches upon the naked &s;pot, and made &s;igns that we &s;hould do the &s;ame: we immedi|ately &s;howed our readine&s;s to comply, and to give a greater &s;olemnity to the rite, the marines were drawn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and march|ing in order, each dropped his bough upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Indians, and we followed their example. We then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and when we came to the watering-place it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to us by &s;igns, that we might occupy that ground, but it happened not to be fit for our purpo&s;e. During our walk they had &s;haken off their fir&s;t timid &s;en&s;e of our &s;uperiority, and were become familiar: they went with us from the watering-place and took a circuit through the woods: as we went along, we di&s;tributed beads and other &s;mall pre&s;ents among them, and had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee that they were much gratified. Our circuit was not le&s;s than four or five miles, through groves of trees, which were loaded with cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit, and afforded the mo&s;t grateful &s;hade. Under the&s;e trees were the habitations of the people, mo&s;t of them being only a roof without walls, and the whole &s;cene realized the poetical fables of Arcadia. We remark|ed however, not without &s;ome regret, that in all our walk we had &s;een only two hogs, and not a &s;ingle fowl. Tho&s;e of our company who had been here with the Dolphin told us, that none of the people whom we had yet &s;een were of the fir&s;t cla&s;s; they &s;u&s;pected that the chiefs had removed, and upon carrying us to the place where what they called the Queen's palace had &s;tood, we found that no traces of it were left. We determined therefore to return in the morning, and endeavour to find out the <HI>Noble&s;&s;e</HI> in their retreats.</P>
<P>In the morning, however, before we could leave the &s;hip, &s;everal canoes came about us, mo&s;t of them from the we&s;tward, and two of them were filled with people, who by their dre&s;s and deportment appeared to be of a &s;uperior rank: two of the&s;e came on board, and each &s;ingled out his friend; one of them, who&s;e name we found to be MATAHAH, fixed upon Mr. Banks, and the other upon me: this ceremony con&s;i&s;ted in taking off great part of their clothes and putting them upon us. In return for this, we pre&s;ented each of them with a hatchet and &s;ome beads. Soon after they made &s;igns for us to go with them to the places where they lived, pointing to the S. W.; and as I was de&s;irous of finding a more commodious harbour, and mak|ing farther trial of the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, I con&s;ented.</P>
<P>I ordered out two boats, and with Mr. Banks and Dr. So|lander, the other Gentlemen, and our two Indian friends, we embarked for our expedition. After rowing about a league,
<PB N="53" REF="013324_0080_0F904D8775B173F0">
they made &s;igns that we &s;hould go on &s;hore, and gave us to under&s;tand that this was the place of their re&s;idence. We ac|cordingly landed, among &s;everal hundreds of the natives, who conducted us into a hou&s;e of much greater length than any we had &s;een. When we entered, we &s;aw a middle-aged man, who&s;e name we afterwards di&s;covered to be TOOTAHAH; mats were immediately &s;pread, and we were de&s;ired to &s;it down over again&s;t him. Soon after we were &s;eated, he ordered a cock and hen to be brought out, which he pre&s;ented to Mr. Banks and me; we accepted the pre&s;ent, and in a &s;hort time each of us received a piece of cloth, perfumed after their manner, by no means di&s;agreeably, which they took great pains to make us remark. The piece pre&s;ented to Mr. Banks was eleven yards long and two wide; in return for which, he gave a laced &s;ilk neckcloth, which he happened to have on, and a linen pocket handkerchief: Tootahah immediately dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this new finery, with an air of perfect complacency and &s;atisfaction. But it is now time that I &s;hould take &s;ome notice of the ladies.</P>
<P>Soon after the interchanging of our pre&s;ents with Tootahah, they attended us to &s;everal large hou&s;es, in which we walked about with great freedom; they &s;hewed us all the civility of which, in our &s;ituation, we could accept; and, on their part, &s;eemed to have no &s;cruple that would have prevented its being carried farther. The hou&s;es, which as I have ob&s;erved before, are all open, except a roof, afforded no place of retirement; but the ladies, by frequently pointing to the mats upon the ground, and &s;ometimes &s;eating them&s;elves and drawing us down upon them, left us no room to doubt of their being much le&s;s jealous of ob&s;ervation than we were.</P>
<P>We now took leave of our friendly Chief, and directed our cour&s;e along the &s;hore; when we had walked about a mile, we met, at the head of a great number of people, another Chief, who&s;e name was TUBOURAI TAMAIDE, with whom we were al&s;o to ratify a treaty of peace, with the ceremony of which we were now become better acquainted. Having received the branch which he pre&s;ented to us, and given another in return, we laid down our hands upon our left brea&s;ts, and pronounced the word <HI>Taio,</HI> which we &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ignify friend; the Chief then gave us to under&s;tand, that if we cho&s;e to eat, he had victuals ready for us. We accepted his offer, and dined very heartily upon fi&s;h, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts and plantains, dre&s;&s;ed after their manner; they eat &s;ome of their fi&s;h raw, and raw fi&s;h was offered to us, but we declined that part of the enter|tainment.</P>
<P>During this vi&s;it a wife of our noble ho&s;t, who&s;e name was TOMIO, did Mr. Banks the honour to place her&s;elf upon the &s;ame mat, clo&s;e by him. Tomio was not in the fir&s;t bloom of her youth, nor did &s;he appear to have been ever remarkable for
<PB N="54" REF="013324_0081_0F904D88DCC259B8">
her beauty: he did not therefore, I believe, pay her the mo&s;t flat|tering attention: it happened too, as a farther mortification to this lady, that &s;eeing a very pretty girl among the crowd, he, not adverting to the dignity of his companion, beckoned her to come to him: the girl, after &s;ome entreaty, complied and &s;at down on the other &s;ide of him; he loaded her with beads, and every &s;howy trifle that would plea&s;e her: his Prince&s;s, though &s;he was &s;omewhat mortified at the preference that was given to her rival, did not di&s;continue her civilities, but &s;till a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;upplied him with the milk of the cocoa-nut, and &s;uch other dainties as were in her reach. This &s;cene might po&s;&s;ibly have become more curious and intere&s;ting, if it had not been &s;uddenly interrupted by an interlude of a more &s;erious kind. Ju&s;t at this time, Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhou&s;e complained that their pockets had been picked. Dr. Solander had lo&s;t an opera gla&s;s in a &s;hagreen ca&s;e, and Mr. Monkhou&s;e his &s;nuff|box. This incident unfortunately put an end to the good-humour of the company. Complaint of the injury was made to the Chief; and, to give it weight, Mr. Banks &s;tarted up, and ha&s;tily &s;truck the but end of his firelock upon the ground: this action, and the noi&s;e that accompanied it, &s;truck the whole a&s;&s;embly with a panic, and every one of the natives ran out of the hou&s;e with the utmo&s;t precipitation, except the Chief, three women, and two or three others, who appeared by their dre&s;s to be of a &s;uperior rank.</P>
<P>The Chief, with a mixture of confu&s;ion and concern, took Mr. Banks by the hand, and led him to a large quantity of cloth, which lay at the other end of the hou&s;e: this he offered to him piece by piece, intimating by &s;igns, that if that would atone for the wrong which had been done, he might take any part of it, or, if he plea&s;ed, the whole. Mr. Banks put it by, and gave him to under&s;tand, that he wanted nothing but what had been di&s;hone&s;tly taken away. Toubourai Tamaide then went ha&s;tily out, leaving Mr. Banks with his wife Tomio, who during the whole &s;cene of terror and confu&s;ion had kept con|&s;tantly at his &s;ide, and intimating his de&s;ire that he &s;hould wait there till his return. Mr. Banks accordingly &s;at down, and conver&s;ed with her, as well as he could be &s;igns, about half an hour. The chief then came back with the &s;nuff-box and the ca&s;e of the opera gla&s;s in his hand, and, with a joy in his countenance that was painted with a &s;trength of expre&s;&s;ion which di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e people from all others, delivered them to the owners. The ca&s;e of the opera gla&s;s, however, upon being opened, was found to be empty; upon this di&s;covery his countenance changed in a moment; and catching Mr. Banks again by the hand, he ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e, without uttering any &s;ound, and led him along the &s;hore, walking with great rapidity: when they had got about a mile from the hou&s;e, a woman met him and gave him a piece of cloth, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="55" REF="013324_0082_0F904D89048A3B40">
ha&s;tily took from her, and continued to pre&s;s forward with it in his hand. Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhou&s;e had followed them, and they came at length to a hou&s;e where they were re|ceived by a woman, to whom he gave the cloth, and intimated to the gentlemen that they &s;hould give her &s;ome beads. They immediately complied; and the beads and cloth being depo|&s;ited upon the floor, the woman went out, and in about half an hour returned with the opera gla&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame joy upon the occa&s;ion that had before been expre&s;&s;ed by the Chief. The beads were now returned, with an inflexible re&s;olution not to accept them; and the cloth was, with the &s;ame pertinacity, forced upon Dr. Solander, as a recompence for the injury that had been done him. He could not avoid accepting the cloth, but in&s;i&s;ted in his turn upon giving a new pre&s;ent of beads to the woman. It will not perhaps be ea&s;y to account for all the &s;teps that were taken in the recovery of this gla&s;s and &s;nuff-box; but this cannot be thought &s;trange, con&s;idering that the &s;cene of action was among a people who&s;e language, policy and con|nections are even now but imperfectly known; upon the whole, however, they &s;how an intelligence and influence which would do honour to any &s;y&s;tem of government, however regular and improved. In the evening, about &s;ix o'clock, we returned to the &s;hip.</P>

<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A Place fixed upon for an Ob&s;ervatory and Fort: an Excur&s;ion into the Woods, and its Con&s;equences. The Fort erected: a Vi&s;it from &s;everal Chiefs on board and at the Fort, with &s;ome Account of the Mu&s;ic of the Natives, and the Manner in which they di&s;po&s;e of their Dead.</HEAD>
<P>ON the next morning, Saturday the 15th, &s;everal of the Chiefs whom we had &s;een the day before, came on board, and brought with them, hogs, bread-fruit, and other refre&s;h|ments, for which we gave them hatchets and linen, and &s;uch things as &s;eemed to be mo&s;t acceptable.</P>
<P>As in my excur&s;ion to the we&s;tward, I had not found any more convenient harbour than that in which we lay, I deter|mined to go on &s;hore and fix upon &s;ome &s;pot, commanded by the &s;hip's guns, where I might throw up a &s;mall fort for our defence, and prepare for making our a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I therefore took a party of men, and landed without delay, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the a&s;tronomer, Mr. Green. We &s;oon fixed upon a part of the &s;andy beach, on the N. E. point of the bay, which was in every re&s;pect conve|nient for our purpo&s;e, and not near any habitation of the natives. Having marked out the ground that we intended to occupy, a
<PB N="56" REF="013324_0083_0F90F10F31338138">
&s;mall tent belonging to Mr. Banks was &s;et up, which had been brought on &s;hore for that purpo&s;e: by this time a great number of the people had gathered about us; but, as it appeared, only to look on, there not being a &s;ingle weapon of any kind among them. I intimated, however, that none of them were to come within the line I had drawn, except one who appeared to be a chief, and Owhaw. To the&s;e two per&s;ons I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf by &s;igns, and endeavoured to make them under&s;tand, that we wanted the ground which we had marked out to &s;leep upon for a certain number of nights, and that then we &s;hould go away. Whether I was under&s;tood I cannot certainly determine; but the people behaved with a deference and re&s;pect that at once plea&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed us: they &s;at down peaceably without the circle, and looked on, without giving us any interruption, till we had done, which was upwards of two hours. As we had &s;een no poultry, and but two hogs, in our walk when we were la&s;t on &s;hore at this place, we &s;u&s;pected that, upon our arrival, they had been driven farther up the country; and the rather, as Owhaw was very importunate with us, by &s;igns, not to go into the woods, which, however, and partly for the&s;e rea&s;ons, we were determined to do. Having therefore appointed the thirteen marines and a petty officer to guard the tent, we &s;et out, and a great number of the natives joined our party. As we were cro&s;&s;ing a little river that lay in our way we &s;aw &s;ome ducks, and Mr. Banks, as &s;oon as he had got over, fired at them, and happened to kill three at one &s;hot: this &s;truck them with the utmo&s;t terror, &s;o that mo&s;t of them fell &s;uddenly to the ground, as if they al&s;o had been &s;hot at the &s;ame di&s;charge: it was not long, however, before they recovered from their fright, and we continued our rout; but we had not gone far before we were alarmed by the report of two pieces, which were fired by the guard at the tent. We had then &s;traggled a little di&s;tance from each other, but Owhaw immediately called us together, and by waving his hand, &s;ent away every Indian who followed us except three, each of whom, as a pledge of peace on their part, and an entreaty that there might be peace on ours, ha&s;tily broke a branch from the trees, and came to us with it in their hands. As we had too much rea&s;on to fear that &s;ome mi&s;chief had happened, we ha&s;ted back to the tent, which was not di&s;tant above half a mile, and when we came up, we found it entirely de&s;erted, except by our own people.</P>
<P>It appeared, that one of the Indians who remained about the tent after we left it, had watched his opportunity, and, taking the century unawares, had &s;natched away his mu&s;quet. Upon this, the petty officer, a mid&s;hipman, who commanded the party, perhaps from a &s;udden fear of farther violence, perhaps from the natural petulance of power newly acquired, and perhaps from a brutality in his nature, ordered the marines to
<PB N="57" REF="013324_0084_0F90F10FDA1BB740">
fire: the men, with as little con&s;ideration or humanity as the officer, immediately di&s;charged their pieces among the thicke&s;t of the flying crowd, con&s;i&s;ting of more than a hundred; and ob&s;erving that the thief did not fall, pur&s;ued him, and &s;hot him dead. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> afterwards learnt, that none of the others were either killed or wounded.</P>
<P>Owhaw, who had never left us, ob&s;erving that we were now totally de&s;erted, got together a few of tho&s;e who had fled, though not without &s;ome difficulty, and ranged them about us: we endeavoured to ju&s;tify our people as well as we could, and to convince the Indians that if they did no wrong to us, we &s;hould do no wrong to them: they went away without any appearance of di&s;tru&s;t or re&s;entment: and having &s;truck our tent, we re|turned to the &s;hip, but by no means &s;atisfied with the tran&s;ac|tions of the day.</P>
<P>Upon que&s;tioning our people more particularly, who&s;e con|duct they &s;oon perceived we could not approve, they alledged that the centinel who&s;e mu&s;quet was taken away, was violently a&s;&s;aulted and thrown down, and that a pu&s;h was afterwards made at him by the man who took the mu&s;quet, before any command was given to fire. It was al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ted, that Owhaw had &s;u&s;picions, atlea&s;t, if not certain knowledge, that &s;omething would be attempted again&s;t our people at the tent, which made him &s;o very earne&s;t in his endeavours to prevent our leaving it; others imputed his importunity to his de&s;ire that we &s;hould con|fine our&s;elves to the beach: and it was remarked that neither Owhaw, nor the Chiefs who remained with us after he had &s;ent the re&s;t of the people away, would have inferred the breach of peace from the firing at the tent, if they had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome injury had been offered by their countrymen; e&s;pecially as Mr. Banks had ju&s;t fired at the ducks: and yet that they did infer a breach of peace from that incident, as was manife&s;t from their waving their hands for the people to di&s;per&s;e, and in&s;tantly pulling green branches from the trees. But what were the real circum&s;tances of this unhappy affair, and whether either and which of the&s;e conjectures were true, can never cer|tainly be known.</P>
<P>The next morning but few of the natives were &s;een upon the beach, and not one of them came off to the &s;hip. This con|vinced us that our endeavours to quiet their apprehen&s;ions had not been effectual; and we remarked with particular regret, that we were de&s;erted even by Owhaw, who had hitherto been &s;o con&s;tant in his attachment, and &s;o active in renewing the peace that had been broken.</P>
<P>Appearances being thus unfavourable, I warped the &s;hip nearer to the &s;hore, and moored her in &s;uch a manner as to com|mand all the N. E. part of the bay, particularly the place which I had marked out for the building a fort. In the evening,
<PB N="58" REF="013324_0085_0F904D89B0046F48">
however, I went on &s;hore with only a boat's crew, and &s;ome of the Gentlemen: the natives gathered about us, but not in the &s;ame number as before; there were I believe between thirty and forty, and they trafficked with us for cocoa-nuts and other fruit, to all appearance as friendly as ever.</P>
<P>On the 17th, early in the morning, we had the misfortune to lo&s;e Mr. Buchan, the per&s;on whom Mr. Banks had brought out as a painter of land&s;capes and figures. He was a &s;ober, di|ligent, and ingenious young man, and greatly regretted by Mr. Banks; who hoped, by his means, to have gratified his friends in England with repre&s;entations of this country and its inhabi|tants, which no other per&s;on on board could delineate with the &s;ame accuracy and elegance. He had always been &s;ubject to epileptic fits, one of which &s;eized him on the mountains of Terra del Fuego, and this di&s;order being aggravated by a bilious complaint which he contracted on board the &s;hip, at length put an end to his life. It was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to bury him on &s;hore, but Mr. Banks thinking that it might perhaps give offence to the natives, with who&s;e cu&s;toms we were then wholly unacquainted, we committed his body to the &s;ea, with as much decency and &s;olemnity as our circum&s;tances and &s;ituation would admit.</P>
<P>In the forenoon of this day we received a vi&s;it from Tubourai Tamaide and Tootahah, our Chiefs, from the We&s;t: they brought with them, as emblems of peace, not branches of plantain, but two young trees, and would not venture on board till the&s;e had been received, having probably been alarmed by the mi&s;chief which had been done at the tent. Each of them al&s;o brought, as propitiatory gifts, &s;ome bread fruit, and a hog ready dre&s;&s;ed: this was a mo&s;t acceptable pre&s;ent, as we perceived that hogs were not always to be got; and in return we gave to each of our noble benefactors a hatchet and a nail. In the evening we went on &s;hore and &s;et up a tent, in which Mr. Green and my&s;elf &s;pent the night, in order to ob&s;erve an eclip&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;atellite of Jupiter; but the weather becoming cloudy, we were di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>On the 18th, at day-break, I went on &s;hore, with as many people as could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;pared from the &s;hip, and began to erect our fort. While &s;ome where employed in throwing up intrenchments, others were bu&s;y in cutting pickets and fa&s;cines, which the natives, who &s;oon gathered round us as they had been u&s;ed to do, were &s;o far from hindering, that many of them voluntarily a&s;&s;i&s;ted us, bringing the pickets and fa&s;cines from the wood where they had been cut, with great alacrity: we had indeed been &s;o &s;crupulous of invading their property, that we purcha&s;ed every &s;take which was u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, and cut down no tree till we had fir&s;t obtained their con&s;ent. The &s;oil where we con&s;tructed our fort was &s;andy, and this
<PB N="59" REF="013324_0086_0F904D8A7A178948">
made it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen the intrenchments with wood; three &s;ides were to be fortified in this manner; the fourth was bounded by a river, upon the banks of which I propo&s;ed to place a proper number of water-ca&s;ks. This day we &s;erved pork to the &s;hip's company for the fir&s;t time, and the Indians brought down &s;o much bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, that we found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end away part of them unbought, and to acquaint them, by &s;igns, that we &s;hould want no more for two days to come. Every thing was purcha&s;ed this day with beads: a &s;ingle bead, as big as a pea, being the purcha&s;e of five or &s;ix cocoa-nuts, and as many of the bread-fruit. Mr. Banks's tent was got up before night within the works, and he &s;lept on &s;hore for the fir&s;t time. Proper centries were placed round it, but no Indian attempted to approach it the whole night.</P>
<P>The next morning, our friend Tubourai Tamaide made Mr. Banks a vi&s;it at the tent, and brought with him not only his wife and family, but the roof of a hou&s;e, and &s;everal materials for &s;etting it up, with furniture and implements of various kinds, intending, as we under&s;tood him, to take up his re&s;i|dence in our neighbourhood: this in&s;tance of confidence and good-will gave us great plea&s;ure, and we determined to &s;trengthen his attachment to us by every means in our power. Soon after his arrival, he took Mr. Banks by the hand, and leading him out of the line, &s;ignified that he &s;hould accompany him into the woods. Mr. Banks readily con&s;ented, and having walked with him about a quarter of a mile, they arrived at a kind of awning which he had already &s;et up, and which &s;eemed to be his occa&s;ional habitation. Here he unfolded a bundle of his country cloth, and taking out two garments, one of red cloth, and the other of very neat matting, he clothed Mr. Banks in them, and without any other ceremony, immediately conducted him back to the tent. His attendants &s;oon after brought him &s;ome pork and bread-fruit, which he eat, dip|ping his meat into &s;alt water in&s;tead of &s;auce: after his meal he retired to Mr. Banks's bed, and &s;lept about an hour. In the afternoon, his wife Tomio brought to the tent a young man about two and twenty years of age, of a very comely ap|pearance, whom they both &s;eemed to acknowledge as their &s;on, though we afterwards di&s;covered that he was not &s;o. In the evening, this young man and another Chief, who had al&s;o paid us a vi&s;it, went away to the we&s;tward, but Tubourai Ta|maide and his wife returned to the awning in the &s;kirts of the wood.</P>
<P>Our Surgeon, Mr. Monkhou&s;e, having walked out this evening, reported, that he had &s;een the body of the man who had been &s;hot at the tents, which he &s;aid was wrapped in cloth, and placed on a kind of bier, &s;upported by &s;takes, under a roof
<PB N="60" REF="013324_0087_0F90F110842D9098">
that &s;eemed to have been &s;et up for the purpo&s;e: that near it were depo&s;ited &s;ome in&s;truments of war, and other things, which he would particularly have examined but for the &s;tench of the body, which was intolerable. He &s;aid, that he &s;aw al&s;o two more &s;heds of the &s;ame kind, in one of which were the bones of a human body that had lain till they were quite dry. We di&s;covered afterwards, that this was the way in which they u&s;ually di&s;po&s;ed of their dead.</P>
<P>A kind of market now began to be kept ju&s;t without the lines, and was plentifully &s;upplied with every thing but pork. Tu|bourai Tamaide was our con&s;tant gue&s;t, imitating our manners, even to the u&s;ing of a k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ife and fork, which he did very handily.</P>
<P>As my curio&s;ity was excited by Mr. Monkhou&s;e's account of the &s;ituation of the man who had been &s;hot, I took an oppor|tunity to go with &s;ome others to &s;ee it. I found the &s;hed under which his body lay, clo&s;e by the hou&s;e in which he re&s;ided when he was alive, &s;ome others being not more than ten yards di&s;|tant; it was about 15 feet long, and 11 broad, and of a pro|portionable height: one end was wholly open, and the other end, and the two &s;ides, were partly enclo&s;ed with a kind of wicker work. The bier on which the corps was depo&s;ited, was a frame of wood like that in which the &s;ea beds, called cots, are placed, with a matted bottom, and &s;upported by four po&s;ts, at the height of about five feet from the ground. The body was covered fir&s;t with a mat, and then with white cloth; by the &s;ide of it lay a wooden mace, one of their weapons of war, and near the head of it, which lay next to the clo&s;e end of the &s;hed, lay two cocoa nut-&s;hells, &s;uch as are &s;ometimes u&s;ed to carry water in; at the other end a bunch of green leaves, with &s;ome dried twigs, all tied together, were &s;tuck in the ground, by which lay a &s;tone about as big as a cocoa-nut: near the&s;e lay one of the young plantain trees, which are u&s;ed for emblems of peace, and clo&s;e by it a &s;tone ax. At the open end of the &s;hed al&s;o hung, in &s;everal &s;trings, a great number of palm-nuts, and without the &s;hed, was &s;tuck upright in the ground, the &s;tem of a plantain tree about five feet high, upon the top of which was placed a cocoa nut-&s;hell full of fre&s;h water: again&s;t the &s;ide of one of the po&s;ts hung a &s;mall bag, containing a few pieces of bread-fruit ready roa&s;ted, which were not all put in at the &s;ame time, for &s;ome of them were fre&s;h, and others &s;tale. I took notice that &s;everal of the natives ob&s;erved us with a mix|ture of &s;olicitude and jealou&s;y in their countenances, and by their ge&s;tures expre&s;&s;ed unea&s;ine&s;s when we went near the body, &s;tanding them&s;elves at a little di&s;tance while we were making our examination, and appearing to be plea&s;ed when we came away.</P>
<P>Our re&s;idence on &s;hore would by no means have been di&s;|agreeable if we had not been ince&s;&s;antly tormented by the flies,
<PB N="61" REF="013324_0088_0F90F1113AFC2C88">
which, among other mi&s;chief, made it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for Mr. Parkin&s;on, Mr. Banks's natural hi&s;tory painter, to work; for they not only covered his &s;ubject &s;o as that no part of its &s;urface could be &s;een, but even eat the colour off the paper as fa&s;t as he could lay it on. We had recour&s;e to mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">quito nets and fly-traps, which, though they made the inconvenience tolerable, were very far from removing it.</P>
<P>On the 22d, Tootahah gave us a &s;pecimen of the mu&s;ic of this country; four per&s;ons performed upon flutes which had only two &s;tops, and therefore could not &s;ound more than four notes, by half tones: they were &s;ounded like our German flutes, except that the performer, in&s;tead of applying it to his mouth, blew into it with one no&s;tril, while he &s;topped the other with his thumb: to the&s;e in&s;truments four other per&s;ons &s;ung, and kept very good time; but only one tune was played during the whole concert.</P>
<P>Several of the natives brought us axes, which they had re|ceived from on board the Dolphin, to grind and repair; but among others, there was one which became the &s;ubject of much &s;peculation, as it appeared to be French: after much enquiry, we learnt that a &s;hip had been here between our arrival and the departure of the Dolphin, which we then conjectured to have been a Spaniard, but now know to have been the Boudeu&s;e, commanded by M. Bougainville.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. An Excur&s;ion to the Ea&s;tward, an Account of &s;everal Incidents that happened both on board and on &s;hore, and of the fir&s;t Inter|view with Oberea, the Per&s;on who, when the Dolphin was here, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be Queen of the I&s;land, with a De&s;crip|tion of the Fort.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 24th, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander examined the country for &s;everal miles along the &s;hore to the ea&s;tward: for about two miles it was flat and fertile; after that the hills &s;tretched quite to the water's edge, and a little farther ran out into the &s;ea &s;o that they were obliged to climb over them. The&s;e hills, which were barren, continued for about three miles more, and then terminated in a large plain, which was full of good hou&s;es, and people who appeared to live in great affluence. In this place there was a river, much more con|&s;iderable than that at our fort, which i&s;&s;ued from a deep and beautiful valley, and, where our travellers cro&s;&s;ed it, though at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea, was near one hundred yards wide. About a mile beyond this river the country became again barren, the rocks every where projecting into the &s;ea, for which
<PB N="62" REF="013324_0089_0F90F112001B8EB0">
&s;ea&s;on they re&s;olved to return. Ju&s;t as they had formed this re|&s;olution, one of the natives offered them refre&s;hment, which they accepted. They found this man to be of a kind that has been de&s;cribed by various authors, as mixed with many nations, but di&s;tinct from them all. His &s;kin was of a dead white, without the lea&s;t appearance of what is called complexion, though &s;ome parts of his body were in a &s;mall degree le&s;s white than others: his hair, eye-brows, and beard as white as his &s;kin; his eyes appeared as if they were blood&s;hot, and he &s;eemed to be very &s;hort-&s;ighted.</P>
<P>At their return they were met by Tubourai Tamaide, and his women, who, at &s;eeing them, felt a joy which not being able to expre&s;s, they bur&s;t into tears, and wept &s;ome time before their pa&s;&s;ion could be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>This evening Dr. Solander lent his knife to one of the&s;e women, who neglected to return it, and the next morning Mr. Banks's al&s;o was mi&s;&s;ing; upon this occa&s;ion I mu&s;t bear my te&s;timony, that the people of this country, of all ranks, men and women, are the errante&s;t thieves upon the face of the earth: the very day after we arrived here, when they came on board us, the chiefs were employed in &s;tealing what they could in the cabbin, and their dependants were no le&s;s indu&s;trious in other parts of the &s;hip; they &s;natched up every thing that it was po&s;&s;ible for them to &s;ecrete till they got on &s;hore, even to the gla&s;s ports, two of which they carried off undetected. Tubourai Tamaide was the only one except Tootahah who had not been found guilty, and the pre&s;umption, ari&s;ing from this circum|&s;tance, that he was exempt from a vice, of which the whole nation be&s;ides were guilty, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to outweigh &s;trong appearances to the contrary, Mr. Banks therefore, though not without &s;ome reluctance, accu&s;ed him of having &s;tolen his knife: he &s;olemnly and &s;teadily denied that he knew any thing of it; upon which Mr. Banks made him under&s;tand, that whoever had taken it, he was determined to have it re|turned: upon this re&s;olute declaration, one of the natives who was pre&s;ent, produced a rag in which three knives were very carefully tied up. One was that which Dr. Solander had lent to the woman, another was a table knife belonging to me, and the owner of the third was not known. With the&s;e the chief immediately &s;et out, in order to make re&s;titution of them to their owners at the tents. Mr. Banks remained with the women, who expre&s;&s;ed great apprehen&s;ions that &s;ome mi&s;chief was de&s;igned again&s;t their lord. When he came to the tents he re&s;tored one of the knives to Dr. Solander and another to me, the third not being owned, and then began to &s;earch for Mr. Banks's in all the places where he had ever &s;een it. After &s;ome time, one of Mr. Banks's &s;ervants, under&s;tanding what he was about immediately fetched his ma&s;ter's knife, which
<PB N="63" REF="013324_0090_0F90F112C2734220">
it &s;eems he had laid by the day before, and till now knew nothing of its having been mi&s;&s;ed. Tubourai Tamaide, upon this demon&s;tration of his innocence, expre&s;&s;ed the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of mind, both in his looks and ge&s;tures; the tears &s;tarted from his eyes, and he made &s;igns, with the knife, that, if he was ever guilty of &s;uch an action as had been imputed to him, he would &s;ubmit to have his throat cut. He then ru&s;hed out of the lines, and returned ha&s;tily to Mr. Banks, with a countenance that &s;everely reproached him with his &s;u&s;picions. Mr. Banks &s;oon under&s;tood that the knife had been received from his &s;ervant, and was &s;carcely le&s;s affected at what had happened than the Chief; he felt him&s;elf to be the guilty per&s;on and was very de&s;irous to atone for his fault. The poor Indian, however violent his pa&s;&s;ions, was a &s;tranger to &s;ullen re&s;entment; and upon Mr. Banks's &s;pending a little time familiary with him, and making him a few trifling pre&s;ents, he forgot the wrong that had been done him, and was perfectly reconciled.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion it may be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e people have a knowledge of right and wrong from the mere dictates of natural con&s;cience; and involuntarily condemn them&s;elves when they do that to others, which they would condemn others for doing to them. That Tubourai Tamaide felt the force of moral obligation, is certain; for the imputation of an action which he con&s;idered as indifferent, would not, when it appeared to be groundle&s;s, have moved him with &s;uch exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion. We mu&s;t indeed e&s;timate the virtue of the&s;e people, by the only &s;tandard of morality, the conformity of their conduct to what in their opinion is right; but we mu&s;t not ha&s;tily conclude that theft is a te&s;timony of the &s;ame depravity in them that it is in us, in the in&s;tances in which our people were &s;ufferers by their di&s;|hone&s;ty; for their temptation was &s;uch, as to &s;urmount would be con&s;idered as a proof of uncommon integrity among tho&s;e who have more knowledge, better principles, and &s;tronger mo|tives to re&s;i&s;t the temptations of illicit advantage: an Indian among penny knives, and beads, or even nails and broken gla&s;s, is in the &s;ame &s;tate of trial with the meane&s;t &s;ervant in Europe among unlocked coffers of jewels and gold.</P>
<P>On the 26th, I mounted &s;ix &s;wivel guns upon the fort, which I was &s;orry to &s;ee &s;truck the natives with dread: &s;ome fi&s;hermen who lived upon the point removed farther off, and Owhaw told us, by &s;igns, that in four days we &s;hould &s;ire great guns.</P>
<P>On the 27th, Tubourai Tamaide, with a friend, who eat with a voracity that I never &s;aw before, and the three women that u&s;ually attended him, who&s;e names were TERAPO, TIRAO, and OMIE, dined at the fort: in the evening they took their leave, and &s;et out for the hou&s;e which Tubourai Tamaide had &s;et up in the &s;kirts of the wood; but in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour he returned in great emotion, and ha&s;tily &s;eizing Mr.
<PB N="64" REF="013324_0091_0F90F11507DF5D98">
Banks's arm, made &s;igns that he &s;hould follow him. Mr. Banks immediately complied, and they &s;oon came up to a place where they found the &s;hip's butcher, with a reaping-hook in his hand: here the Chief &s;topped, and, in a tran&s;port of rage which rendered his &s;igns &s;carcely intelligible, intimated that the butcher had threatened, or attempted, to cut his wife's throat with the reaping-hook. Mr. Banks then &s;ignified to him, that if he could fully explain the offence, the man &s;hould be puni&s;hed. Upon this he became more calm, and made Mr. Banks under&s;tand that the offender, having taken a fancy to a &s;tone hatchet which lay in his hou&s;e, had offered to purcha&s;e it of his wife for a nail: that &s;he having refu&s;ed to part with it upon any terms, he had catched it up, and throwing down the nail, threatened to cut her throat if &s;he made any re&s;i&s;tance: to prove this charge the hatchet and the nail were produced, and the butcher had &s;o little to &s;ay in his defence that there was not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to doubt of its truth.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks having reported this matter to me, I took an op|portunity, when the Chief and his women, with other Indians, were on board the &s;hip, to call up the butcher, and after a re|capitulation of the charge and the proof, I gave orders that he &s;hould be puni&s;hed, as well to prevent other offences of the &s;ame kind, as to acquit Mr. Banks of his promi&s;e; the Indians &s;aw him &s;tripped and tied up to the rigging with a fixed attention, waiting in &s;ilent &s;u&s;pence for the event; but as &s;oon as the fir&s;t &s;troke was given, they interfered with great agitation, earne&s;tly intreating that the re&s;t of the puni&s;hment might be remitted: to this, however, for many rea&s;ons, I could not con&s;ent, and when they found that they could not prevail by their interce&s;&s;ion, they gave vent to their pity by tears.</P>
<P>Their tears indeed, like tho&s;e of children, were always ready to expre&s;s any pa&s;&s;ion that was &s;trongly excited, and like tho&s;e of children they al&s;o appeared to be forgotten as &s;oon as &s;hed; of which the following among many others, is a remarkable in&s;tance. Very early in the morning of the 28th, even before it was day, a great number of them came down to the fort, and Terapo being ob&s;erved among the women on the out&s;ide of the gate, Mr. Banks went out and brought her in; he &s;aw that the tears then &s;tood in her eyes, and as &s;oon as &s;he entered they began to flow in great abundance: he enquired earne&s;tly the cau&s;e, but in&s;tead of an&s;wering &s;he took from under her garment a &s;hark's tooth, and &s;truck it &s;ix or &s;even times into her head with great force; a profu&s;ion of blood followed, and &s;he talked loud, but in a mo&s;t melancholly tone, for &s;ome minutes, without at all regarding his enquiries, which he repeated with &s;till more impatience and concern, while the other Indians, to his great &s;urprize, talked and laughed, without taking the lea&s;t notice of her di&s;tre&s;s. But her own behaviour was &s;till more
<PB N="65" REF="013324_0092_0F90F11678E34F08">
extraordinary. As &s;oon as the bleeding was over, &s;he looked up with a &s;mile, and began to collect &s;ome &s;mall pieces of cloth, which during her bleeding &s;he had thrown down to catch the blood; as &s;oon as &s;he had picked them all up, &s;he carried them out of the tent, and threw them into the &s;ea, carefully di&s;per&s;|ing them abroad, as if &s;he wi&s;hed to prevent the &s;ight of them from reviving the remembrance of what &s;he had done. She then plunged into the river, and after having wa&s;hed her whole body, returned to the tents with the &s;ame gaiety and cheerful|ne&s;s as if nothing had happened.</P>
<P>It is not indeed &s;trange that the &s;orrows of the&s;e artle&s;s people &s;hould be tran&s;ient, any more than that their pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be &s;uddenly and &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed: what they feel they have never been taught either to di&s;gui&s;e or &s;uppre&s;s, and having no habits of thinking which perpetually recal the pa&s;t, and anticipate the future, they are affected by all the changes of the pa&s;&s;ing hour, and reflect the colour of the time, however frequently it may vary: they have no project which is to be pur&s;ued from day to day, the &s;ubject of unremitted anxiety and &s;olicitude, that fir&s;t ru&s;hes into the mind when they awake in the morning, and is la&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed when they &s;leep at night. Yet if we admit that they are upon the whole happier than we, we mu&s;t admit that the child is happier than the man, and that we are lo&s;ers by the perfection of our nature, the increa&s;e of our knowledge, and the enlargement of our views.</P>
<P>Canoes were continually coming in during all this forenoon, and the tents at the &s;ort were crowded with people of both &s;exes from different parts of the i&s;land. I was my&s;elf bu&s;y on board the &s;hip, but Mr. Mollineux, our ma&s;ter, who was one of tho&s;e that made the la&s;t voyage in the Dolphin, went on &s;hore. As &s;oon as he entered Mr. Banks's tent he fixed his eyes upon one of the women, who was &s;itting there with great compo&s;ure among the re&s;t, and immediately declared her to be the per&s;on who at that time was &s;uppo&s;ed to be Queen of the i&s;land; &s;he al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, acknowledging him to be one of the &s;trangers whom &s;he had &s;een before. The attention of all pre&s;ent was now diverted from every other object, and wholly engaged in con&s;idering a per&s;on who had made &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a figure in the accounts that had been given of this i&s;land by its fir&s;t di&s;coverers; and we &s;oon learnt that her name was OBEREA. She &s;eemed to be about forty years of age, and was not only tall, but of a large make; her &s;kin was white, and there was an uncommon intelligence and &s;en&s;ibility in her eyes: &s;he ap|peared to have been hand&s;ome when &s;he was young, but at this time little more than memorials of her beauty were left.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as her quality was known, an offer was made to conduct her to the &s;hip. Of this &s;he readily accepted, and came on board with two men and &s;everal women, who &s;eemed
<PB N="66" REF="013324_0093_0F8FF51B0220C4F0">
to be all of her family; I received her with &s;uch marks of di&s;tinction as I thought would gratify her mo&s;t, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not &s;paring of my pre&s;ents, among which this augu&s;t per&s;onage &s;eemed particularly delighted with a child's doll. After &s;ome time &s;pent on board, I attended her back to the &s;hore; and as &s;oon as we landed, &s;he pre&s;ented me with a hog, and &s;everal bunches of plantains, which &s;he cau&s;ed to be carried from her canoes up to the fort in a kind of proce&s;&s;ion, of which &s;he and my&s;elf brought up the rear. In our way to the fort we met Tootahah, who, though not King, appeared to be at this time inve&s;ted with the &s;overeign authority; he &s;eemed not to be well plea&s;ed with the di&s;tinction that was &s;hewed to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> lady, and became &s;o jealous when &s;he produced her doll, that to propitiate him it was thought proper to compliment him with another. At this time he thought fit to prefer a doll to a hatchet; but this preference aro&s;e only from a childi&s;h jealou&s;y, which could not be &s;oothed but by a gift of exactly the &s;ame kind with that which had been pre&s;ented to Oberea; for dolls in a very &s;hort time were univer&s;ally con&s;idered as trifles of no value.</P>
<P>The men who had vi&s;ited us from time to time had, without &s;cruple, eaten of our provi&s;ions; but the women had never yet been prevailed upon to ta&s;te a mor&s;el. To-day, however, though they refu&s;ed the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations to dine with the Gentlemen, they afterwards retired to the &s;ervants apart|ment, and eat of plantains very heartily; a my&s;tery of female oeconomy here, which none of us could explain.</P>
<P>On the 29th, not very early in the forenoon, Mr. Banks went to pay his court to Oberea, and was told that &s;he was &s;till a&s;leep under the awning of her canoe: thither therefore he went, intending to call her up, a liberty which he thought he might take, without any danger of giving offence: but, upon looking into her chamber, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment, he found her in bed with a hand&s;ome young fellow about five and twenty, who&s;e name was OBADEE: he retreated with &s;ome ha&s;te and confu|&s;ion, but was &s;oon made to under&s;tand, that &s;uch amours gave no occa&s;ion to &s;candal, and that Obadee was univer&s;ally known to have been &s;elected by her as the object of her private favours. The lady being too polite to &s;uffer Mr. Banks to wait long in her antichamber, dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with more than u&s;ual expedi|tion, and as a token of &s;pecial grace, clothed him in a &s;uit of fine cloth and proceeded with him to the tents. In the evening, Mr. Banks paid a vi&s;it to Tubourai Tamaide, as he had often done before, by candle light, and was equally grieved and &s;ur|prized to find him and his family in a melancholly mood, and mo&s;t of them in tears: he endeavoured in vain to di&s;cover the cau&s;e, and therefore his &s;tay among them was but &s;hort. When he reported this circum&s;tance to the officers at the fort, they re|collected that Owhaw had foretold, that in four days we &s;hould

fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">; and as this was the eve of the third day, the &s;ituation in which Tubourai Tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aide and his family had been found, alarmed them. The &s;entries therefore were doubled at the fort, and the Gentlemen &s;lept under arms; at two in the morning, Mr. Banks him&s;elf went round the point, but found every thing &s;o quiet, that he gave up all &s;u&s;picions of mi&s;chief intended by the natives as groundle&s;s. We had however another &s;ource of &s;ecurity; our little fortification was now complete. The north and &s;outh &s;ides con&s;i&s;ted of a bank of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> four foot and an half high on the in&s;ide, and a ditch without ten feet broad and &s;ix deep; on the we&s;t &s;ide, facing the bay, there was a bank of earth four feet high, and palli&s;a|does upon that, but no ditch, the works here being at high-water mark; on the ea&s;t &s;ide, upon the bank of the river, was placed a double row of water ca&s;ks, filled with water; and as this was the weake&s;t &s;ide, the two four pounders were planted there, and &s;ix &s;wivel guns were mounted &s;o as to command the only two avenues from the woods. Our garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of about five and forty men with &s;mall arms, including the officers, and the gentlemen who re&s;ided on &s;hore; and our &s;entries were as well relieved as in the be&s;t regulated frontier in Europe.</P>
<P>We continued our vigilance the next day, though we had no particular rea&s;on to think it nece&s;&s;ary; but about ten o'clock in the morning, Tomio came running to the tents, with a mixture of grief and fear in her countenance, and taking Mr. Banks, to whom they applied in every emergency and di&s;tre&s;s, by the arm, intimated that Tubourai Tamaide was dying, in con&s;e|quence of &s;omething which our people had given him to eat, and that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly go with her to his hou&s;e. Mr. Banks &s;et out without delay, and found his Indian friend leaning his head again&s;t a po&s;t, in an attitude of the utmo&s;t languor and de|&s;pondency; the people about him intimated that he had been vomiting, and brought out a leaf folded up with great care, which they &s;aid contained &s;ome of the poi&s;on, by the deleterious effects of which he was now dying. Mr. Banks ha&s;tily opened the leaf, and upon examining its contents found them to be no other than a chew of tobacco, which the chief had begged of &s;ome of our people, and which they had indi&s;creetly given him: he had ob&s;erved that they kept it long in the mouth, and being de&s;irous of doing the &s;ame, he had chewed it to powder, and &s;wallowed the &s;pittle. During the examination of the leaf and its co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tents, he looked up at Mr. Banks with the mo&s;t piteous a&s;pect, and intimated that he had but a very &s;hort time to live. Mr. Banks, however, being now ma&s;ter of his di&s;ea&s;e, directed him to drink plentifully of cocoa-nut milk, which in a &s;hort time put an end to his &s;ickne&s;s and apprehen&s;ions, and he &s;pent the day at the fort with that uncommon flow of cheerfulne&s;s and good-humour, which is always produced by a &s;udden and unexpected relief from pain either of body or mind.</P>

Captain Wallis having brought home one of the adzes which the&s;e people, having no metal of any kind, make of &s;tone, Mr. Stevens, the Secretary to the Admiralty, procured one to be made of iron in imitation of it, which I brought out with me, to &s;hew how much we excelled in making tools after their own fa&s;hion: this I had not yet produced, as it never happened to come into my mind. But on the fir&s;t of May, Tootahah coming on board about ten o'clock in the forenoon, expre&s;&s;ed a great curio&s;ity to &s;ee the contents of every che&s;t and drawer that was in my cabbin; as I always made a point of gratifying him, I opened them immediately, and having taken a fancy to many things that he &s;aw, and collected them together, he at la&s;t happened to ca&s;t his eye upon this adze; he in&s;tantly &s;natched it up with the greate&s;t eagerne&s;s, and putting away every thing which he had before &s;elected, he a&s;ked me whether I would let him have that: I readily con&s;ented; and, as if he was afraid I &s;hould repent, he carried it off immediately in a tran&s;port of joy, without making any other reque&s;t, which whatever had been our liberality was &s;eldom the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>About noon, a Chief, who had dined with me a few days before, accompanied by &s;ome of his women, came on board alone: I had ob&s;erved that he was fed by his women, but I made no doubt, that upon occa&s;ion he would conde&s;cend to feed him&s;elf: in this, however, I found my&s;elf mi&s;taken. When my noble gue&s;t was &s;eated, and the dinner upon the table, I helped him to &s;ome victuals: as I ob&s;erved that he did not im|mediately begin his meal, I pre&s;&s;ed him to eat: but he &s;till continued to &s;it motionle&s;s like a &s;tatue, without attempting to put a &s;ingle mor&s;el into his mouth, and would certainly have gone without his dinner, if one of the &s;ervants had not fed him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The Ob&s;ervatory &s;et up; the Quadrant &s;tolen, and Con&s;equences of the Theft: A Vi&s;it to Tootahah: De&s;cription of a Wre&s;tling-match: European Seeds &s;own: Names given to our People by the Indians.</HEAD>
<P>IN the afternoon, of Monday the 1&s;t of May, we &s;et up the ob&s;ervatory, and took the a&s;tronomical quadrant, with &s;ome other in&s;truments on &s;hore, for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>The next morning, about nine o'clock, I went on &s;hore with Mr. Green to fix the quadrant in a &s;ituation for u&s;e, when to our inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urprize and concern it was not to be found. It had been depo&s;ited in the tent which was re&s;erved for my u&s;e, where, as I pa&s;&s;ed the night on board, nobody &s;lept: it
<PB N="69" REF="013324_0096_0F904D23B54ABB10">
had never been taken out of the packing-ca&s;e, which was eighteen inches &s;quare, and the whole was of con&s;iderable weight; a &s;entinel had been po&s;ted the whole night within five yards of the tent door, and none of the other in&s;truments were mi&s;&s;ing. We at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected that it might have been &s;tolen by &s;ome of our own people, who &s;eeing a deal box, and not knowing the contents, might think it contained nails, or &s;ome other &s;ubjects of traffic with the natives. A large reward was therefore offered to any one who could find it, as, without this, we could not perform the &s;ervice for which our voyage was principally under|taken. Our &s;earch in the mean time was not confined to the fort and the places adjacent, but as the ca&s;e might po&s;&s;ibly have been carried back to the &s;hip, if any of our own people had been the thieves, the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch was made for it on board; all the parties however returned without any news of the quadrant. Mr. Banks, therefore, who upon &s;uch occa&s;ions declined neither labour nor ri&s;k, and who had more influence over the Indians than any of us, determined to go in &s;earch of it into the woods; he hoped, that if it had been &s;tolen by the natives, he &s;hould find it wherever they had opened the box, as they would immediately di&s;cover that to them it would be wholly u&s;ele&s;s: or, if in this expectation he &s;hould be di&s;appointed, that he might recover it by the a&s;cendancy he had acquired over the Chiefs. He &s;et out, accompanied by a mid&s;hipman and Mr. Green, and as he was cro&s;&s;ing the river he was met by Tu|bourai Tamaide, who immediately made the figure of a triangle with three bits of &s;traw upon his hand. By this Mr. Banks knew that the Indians were the thieves; and that, although they had opened the ca&s;e, they were not di&s;po&s;ed to part with the contents. No time was therefore to be lo&s;t, and Mr. Banks made Tubourai Tamaide under&s;tand, that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly go with him to the place whither the quadrant had been carried; he con&s;ented, and they &s;et out together to the ea&s;tward, the Chief inquiring at every hou&s;e which they pa&s;&s;ed after the thief by name: the people readily told him which way he was gone, and how long it was &s;ince he had been there: the hope which this gave them that they &s;hould overtake him, &s;upported them under their fatigue, and they pre&s;&s;ed forward, &s;ometimes walk|ing, &s;ometimes running, though the weather was intolerably hot; when they had climbed a hill at the di&s;tance of about four miles, their conductor &s;hewed them a point full three miles far|ther, and gave them to under&s;tand that they were not to ex|pect the in&s;trument till they had got thither. Here they pau&s;ed; they had no arms, except a pair of pi&s;tols, which Mr. Banks always carried in his pocket; they were going to a place that was at lea&s;t &s;even miles di&s;tant from the fort, where the Indians might be le&s;s &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive than at home, and to take from them what they had ventured their lives to get; and what, notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="70" REF="013324_0097_0F8FF51BC16D4F88">
our conjectures, they appeared de&s;irous to keep: the&s;e were di&s;couraging circum&s;tances, and their &s;ituation would become more critical at every &s;tep. They determined, how|ever, not to relinqui&s;h their enterprize, nor to pur&s;ue it without taking the be&s;t mea&s;ures for their &s;ecurity that were in their power. It was therefore determined, that Mr. Banks and Mr. Green &s;hould go on, and that the Mid&s;hipman &s;hould return to me, and de&s;ire that I would &s;end a party of men after them, acquainting me at the &s;ame time, that it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould return till it was dark. Upon receiving this me&s;&s;age I &s;et out, with &s;uch a party as I thought &s;ufficient for the occa|&s;ion; leaving orders, both at the &s;hip and at the fort, that no canoe &s;hould be &s;uffered to go out of the bay, but that none of the natives &s;hould be &s;eized or detained.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mr. Banks and Mr. Green pur&s;ued their journey, under the au&s;pices of Tubourai Tamaide, and in the very &s;pot which he had &s;pecified, they met one of his own people, with part of the quadrant in his hand. At this mo&s;t welcome &s;ight they &s;topped; and a great number of Indians immediately came up, &s;ome of whom pre&s;&s;ing rather rudely upon them, Mr. Banks thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew one of his pi&s;tols, the &s;ight of which reduced them in&s;tantly to order: as the crowd that gathered round them was every moment in|crea&s;ing, he marked out a circle in the gra&s;s, and they ranged them&s;elves on the out&s;ide of it to the number of &s;everal hundreds with great quietne&s;s and decorum. Into the middle of this circle, the box, which was now arrived, was ordered to be brought, with &s;everal reading gla&s;&s;es, and other &s;mall matters, which in their hurry they had put into a pi&s;tol-ca&s;e, that Mr. Banks knew to be his property, it having been &s;ome time before &s;tolen from the tents, with a hor&s;e pi&s;tol in it, which he immediately demanded, and which was al&s;o re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Mr. Green was impatient to &s;ee whether all that had been taken away was returned, and upon examining the box found the &s;tand, and a few &s;mall things of le&s;s con&s;equence, waiting; &s;everal per&s;ons were &s;ent in &s;earch of the&s;e, and mo&s;t of the &s;mall things were returned: but it was &s;ignified that the thief had not brought the &s;tand &s;o far, and that it would be delivered to our friends as they went back; this being confirmed by Tu|bourai Tamaide, they prepared to return, as nothing would then be wanting but what might ea&s;ily be &s;upplied; and after they had advanced about two miles, I met them with my party, to our mutual &s;atisfaction, congratulating each other upon the recovery of the quadrant, with a plea&s;ure proportioned to the importance of the event.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock, Mr. Banks with Tubourai Tamaide got back to the fort; when, to his great &s;urprize, he found Too|tahah in cu&s;tody, and many of the natives in the utmo&s;t terror
<PB N="71" REF="013324_0098_0F90F0AA811E1A30">
and di&s;tre&s;s, crowding about the gate. He went ha&s;tily in, &s;ome of the Indians were &s;uffered to follow him, and the &s;cene was extremely affecting. Tubourai Tamaide pre&s;&s;ing forward, ran up to Tootahah, and catching him in his arms, they both bur&s;t into tears, and wept over each other, without being able to &s;peak: the other Indians were al&s;o in tears for their Chief, both he and they being &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the notion that he was to be put to death. In this &s;ituation they continued till I entered the fort, which was about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I was equally &s;urprized and concerned at what had happened, the confining Tootahah being contrary to my orders, and therefore in&s;tantly &s;et him at liberty. Upon en|quiring into the affair, I was told, that my going into the woods with a party of men under arms, at a time when a rob|bery had been committed, which it was &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould re|&s;ent, in proportion to our apparent injury by the lo&s;s, had &s;o alarmed the natives, that in the evening they began to leave the neighbourhood of the fort with their effects: that a double canoe having been &s;een to put off from the bottom of the bay by Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, who was left in com|mand on board the &s;hip, and who had received orders not to &s;uffer any canoe to go out, he &s;ent the Boat&s;wain with a boat after her to bring her back: that as &s;oon as the boat came up, the Indians, being alarmed, leaped into the &s;ea; and that Tootahah, being unfortunately one of the number, the Boat|&s;wain took him up, and brought him to the &s;hip, &s;uffering the re&s;t of the people to &s;wim on &s;hore: that Mr. Gore, not &s;uffici|ently attending to the order that none of the people &s;hould be confined, had &s;ent him to the fort, and Mr. Hicks, the Fir&s;t Lieutenant, who commanded there, receiving him in charge from Gore, did not think him&s;elf at liberty to di&s;mi&s;s him.</P>
<P>The notion that we intended to put him to death had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him &s;o &s;trongly, that he could not be per&s;uaded to the contrary till by my orders he was led out of the fort. The people received him as they would have done a father in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, and every one pre&s;&s;ed forward to embrace him. Sudden joy is commonly liberal, without a &s;crupulous regard to merit; and Tootahah, in the fir&s;t expan&s;ion of his heart, upon being unexpectedly re&s;tored to liberty and life, in|&s;i&s;ted upon our receiving a pre&s;ent of two hogs; though, being con&s;cious that upon this occa&s;ion we had no claim to favours, we refu&s;ed them many times.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander attended the next morning in their u&s;ual capacity of market-men, but very few Indians ap|peared, and tho&s;e who came brought no provi&s;ions. Toota|hah, however, &s;ent &s;ome of his people for the canoe that had been detained, which they took away. A canoe having al&s;o been detained that belonged to Oberea, TUPIA, the per&s;on
<PB N="72" REF="013324_0099_0F8FF51CEAF5E4F0">
who managed her affairs when the Dolphin was here, was &s;ent to examine whether any thing on board had been take away: and he was &s;o well &s;atisfied of the contrary, that he left the canoe where he found it, and joined us at the fort, where he &s;pent the day, and &s;lept on board the canoe at night. About noon, &s;ome thing boats came abrea&s;t of the tents, but would part with very little of what they had on board; and we felt the want of cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit very &s;everely. In the cour&s;e of the day, Mr. Banks walked out into the woods, that by conver&s;ing with the people he might recover their confidence and good-will: he found them civil, but they all complained of the ill-treatment of their Chief; who, they &s;aid, had been beaten and pulled by the hair. Mr. Banks endeavoured to convince them, that he had &s;uffered no per&s;onal violence, which to the be&s;t of our knowledge was true; yet, perhaps the Boat|&s;wain had behaved with a brutality which he was afraid or a&s;hamed to acknowledge. The Chief him&s;elf being, probably, upon recollection, of opinion that we had ill-de&s;erved the hogs, which he had left with us as a pre&s;ent, &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger in the afternoon to demand an ax, and a &s;hirt in return; but as I was told that he did not intend to come down to the fort for ten days, I excu&s;ed my&s;elf from giving them till I &s;hould &s;ee him, hoping that his impatience might induce him to fetch them, and knowing that ab&s;ence would probably continue the coolne&s;s between us, to which the fir&s;t interview might put an end.</P>
<P>The next day we were &s;till more &s;en&s;ible of the inconvenience we had incurred by giving offence to the people in the per&s;on of their Chief, for the market was &s;o ill &s;upplied that we were in want of nece&s;&s;aries. Mr. Banks there ore went into the woods to Tubourai Tamaide, and with &s;ome difficulty per|&s;uaded him to let us have five ba&s;kets of bread-fruit; a very &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply, as they contained above one hundred and twenty. In the afternoon another me&s;&s;enger arrived from Too|tahah for the ax and &s;hirt; as it was now become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to recover he friend&s;hip of this man, without which it would be &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to procure provi&s;ions, I &s;ent word that Mr. Banks and my&s;elf would vi&s;it him on the morrow, and bring what he wanted with us.</P>
<P>Early the next morning he &s;ent again to remind me of my promi&s;e, and his people &s;eemed to wait till we &s;hould &s;et out with great impatience: I therefore ordered the pinnace, in which I embarked with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander about ten o'clock: we took one of Tootahah's people in the boat with us, and in about an hour we arrived at his place of re&s;i|dence, which is called EPARRE, and is about four miles to the we&s;tward of the tents.</P>
<P>We found the people waiting for us in great numbers upon the &s;hore, &s;o that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for us to have
<PB N="73" REF="013324_0100_0F90F09F2FA1BDA8">
proceeded, if way had not been made for us by a tall well-looking man, who had &s;omething like a turban about his head, and a long white &s;tick in his hand, with which he laid about him at an unmerciful rate. This man conducted us to the Chief, while the people &s;houted round us, <HI>Taio Tootahah,</HI> "Tootahah is your friend." We found him, like an ancient Patriarch, &s;itting under a tree, with a number of venerable old men &s;tanding round him; he made a &s;ign to us to &s;it down, and immediately a&s;ked for his ax: this I pre&s;ented to him, with an upper garment of broadcloth, made after the country fa&s;hion, and trimmed with tape, to which I al&s;o added a &s;hirt: he re|ceived them with great &s;atisfaction, and immediately put on the garment; but the &s;hirt he gave to the per&s;on who had cleared the way for us upon our landing, who was now &s;eated by us, and of whom he &s;eemed de&s;irous that we &s;hould take particular notice. In a &s;hort time, Oberea, and &s;everal other women whom we knew, came and &s;at down among us: Toota|hah left us &s;everal times, but after a &s;hort ab&s;ence returned; we thought it had been to &s;how him&s;elf in his new finery to the people, but we wronged him, for it was to give directions for our refre&s;hment and entertainment. While we were waiting for his return the la&s;t time he left us, very impatient to be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, as we were almo&s;t &s;uffocated in the croud, word was brought us, that he expected us el&s;ewhere: we found him &s;itting under the awning of our own boat, and making &s;igns that we &s;hould come to him: as many of us therefore went on board as the boat would hold, and he then ordered bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts to be brought, of both which we ta&s;ted, rather to gratify him than becau&s;e we had a de&s;ire to eat. A me&s;&s;age was &s;oon after brought him, upon which he went out of the boat, and we were in a &s;hort time de&s;ired to follow. We were conducted to a large area or court-yard, which was railed round with bamboos about three feet high, on one &s;ide of his hou&s;e, where an entertainment was provided for us, entirely new this was a wre&s;tling match. At the upper end of the area &s;at the Chief, and &s;everal of his principal men were ranged on each &s;ide of him, &s;o as to form a &s;emicircle; the&s;e were the judges, by whom the victor was to be applauded; &s;eats were al&s;o left for us at each end of the line, but we cho&s;e rather to be at liberty among the re&s;t of the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>When all was ready, ten or twelve per&s;ons, whom we under|&s;tood to be the combatants, and who were naked, except a cloth that was fa&s;tened about the wai&s;t, entered the area, and walked &s;lowly round it, in a &s;tooping po&s;ture, with their left hands on their right brea&s;ts, and their right hands open, with which they frequently &s;truck the left fore-arm &s;o as to produce a quick &s;mart &s;ound: this was a general challenge to the com|batants whom they were to engage, or any other per&s;on
<PB N="74" REF="013324_0101_0F8FF51D404029C8">
pre&s;ent: after the&s;e followed others in the &s;ame manner, and then a particular challenge was given, by which each man &s;ingled out his antagoni&s;t: this was done by joining the finger ends of both hands, and bringing them to the brea&s;t, at the &s;ame time moving the elbows up and down with a quick motion: if the per&s;on to whom this was addre&s;&s;ed accepted the challenge, he repeated the &s;igns, and immediately each put him&s;elf into an attitude to engage: the next minute they clo&s;ed, but, except in fir&s;t &s;eizing each other, it was a mere conte&s;t of &s;trength: each endeavoured to lay hold of the other, fir&s;t by the thigh, and if that failed by the hand, the hair, the cloth, or el&s;ewhere as he could: when this was done they grappled, without the lea&s;t dexterity or &s;kill, till one of them, by having a more advantageous hold, or greater mu&s;cular force, threw the other on his back. When the conte&s;t was over, the old men gave their plaudit to the victor in a few words, which they repeated together in a kind of tune: his conque&s;t was al&s;o generally celebrated by three huzzas. The entertainment was then &s;u&s;pended for a few minutes, after which another couple of wre&s;tlers came forward and engaged in the &s;ame manner: if it happened that neither was thrown, after the conte&s;t had continued about a minute, they parted, either by con&s;ent or the intervention of their friends, and in this ca&s;e each &s;lapped his arm, as a challenge to a new engagement, either with the &s;ame antagoni&s;t or &s;ome other. While the wre&s;tlers were engaged, another party of men performed a dance which la&s;ted al&s;o about a minute; but neither of the&s;e parties took the lea&s;t notice of each other, their attention being wholly fixed on what they were doing. We ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure, that the conqueror never exulted over the vanqui&s;hed, and that the vanqui&s;hed never repined at the &s;ucce&s;s of the conqueror; the whole conte&s;t was carried on with perfect good-will and good-humour, though in the pre&s;ence of at lea&s;t five hundred &s;pectat|ors, of whom &s;ome were women. The number of women indeed was comparatively &s;mall, none but tho&s;e of rank were pre&s;ent, and we had rea&s;on to believe that they would not have been &s;pectators of this exerci&s;e but in compliment to us.</P>
<P>This la&s;ted about two hours; during all which time the man who had made way for us when we landed, kept the people at a proper di&s;tance, by &s;triking tho&s;e who pre&s;&s;ed forward very &s;everely with his &s;tick: upon enquiry we learnt, that he was an officer belonging to Tootahah, acting as a ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who are acquainted with the athletic &s;ports of very remote antiquity, not to remark a rude re&s;emblance of them in this wre&s;tling-match among the natives of a little i&s;land in the mid&s;t of the Pacific Ocean: and even our female readers may recollect the account given of them by
<PB N="75" REF="013324_0102_0F90F0A845E5FAB0">
Fenelon in his Telemachus, where, though the events are fictitious, the manners of the age are faithfully tran&s;cribed from authors by whom they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been truly related.</P>
<P>When the wre&s;tling was over, we were given to under&s;tand that two hogs, and a large quantity of bread-fruit were prepar|ing for our dinner, which, as our appetites were now keen, was very agreeable intelligence. Our ho&s;t, however, &s;eemed to repent of his liberality; for, in&s;tead of &s;etting his two hogs before us, he ordered one of them to be carried into our boat; at fir&s;t we were not &s;orry for his new di&s;po&s;ition of matters, thinking that we &s;hould dine more comfortably in the boat than on &s;hore, as the croud would more ea&s;ily be kept at a di&s;tance: but when we came on board, he ordered us to proceed with his hog to the &s;hip; this was mortifying, as we were now to row four miles while our dinner was growing cold; however, we thought fit to comply, and were at la&s;t gratified with the cheer that he had provided, of which he and Tubourai Tamaide had a liberal &s;hare.</P>
<P>Our reconciliation with this man operated upon the people like a charm; for he was no &s;ooner known to be on board, than bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and other provi&s;ions were brought to the fort in great plenty.</P>
<P>Affairs now went on in the u&s;ual channel; but pork being &s;till a &s;carce commodity, our Ma&s;ter, Mr. Molineux, and Mr. Green went in the pinnace to the ea&s;tward, on the 8th, early in the morning, to &s;ee whether they could procure any hogs or poultry in that part of the country: they proceeded in that di|rection twenty miles; but though they &s;aw many hogs, and one turtle, they could not purcha&s;e either at any price: the people every where told them, that they all belonged to Toota|hah, and that they could &s;ell none of them without his per|mi&s;&s;ion. We now began to think that this man was indeed a great Prince; for an influence &s;o exten&s;ive and ab&s;olute could be acquired by no other. And we afterwards found that he admini&s;tered the government of this part of the i&s;land, as &s;overeign, for a minor whom we never &s;aw all the time that we were upon it. When Mr. Green returned from this expe|dition, he &s;aid he had &s;een a tree of a &s;ize which he was afraid to relate, it being no le&s;s than fifty yards in circumference; but Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander &s;oon explained to him, that it was a &s;pecies of the fig, the branches of which, bending down, take fre&s;h root in the earth, and thus form a congeries of trunks, which being very clo&s;e to each other, and all joined by a common vegetation, might ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for one.</P>
<P>Though the market at the fort was now tolerably &s;upplied, provi&s;ions were brought more &s;lowly: a &s;ufficient quantity u&s;ed to be purcha&s;ed between &s;un-ri&s;e and eight o'clock, but it was now become nece&s;&s;ary to attend the greate&s;t part of the day.
<PB N="76" REF="013324_0103_0F90F0AB3B8FCD80">
Mr. Banks, therefore, fixed his little boat up before the door of the fort, which was of great u&s;e as a place to trade in: hitherto we had purcha&s;ed cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit for beads; but the market becoming rather &s;lack in the&s;e articles, we were now, for the fir&s;t time, forced to bring out our nails: one of our &s;malle&s;t &s;ize, which was about four inches long, procured us twenty cocoa-nuts, and bread-fruit in proportion, &s;o that in a &s;hort time our fir&s;t plenty was re&s;tored.</P>
<P>On the 9th, &s;oon after breakfa&s;t, we received a vi&s;it from Oberea, being the fir&s;t that &s;he had made us after the lo&s;s of our quadrant, and the unfortunate confinement of Tootahah; with her came her pre&s;ent favourite, Obadee, and Tupia: they brought us a hog and &s;ome bread-fruit, in return for which we gave her a hatchet. We had now afforded our Indian friends a new and intere&s;ting object of curio&s;ity, our forge, which having been &s;et up &s;ome time, was almo&s;t con&s;tantly at work. It was now common for them to bring pieces of iron, which we &s;uppo&s;ed they mu&s;t have got from the Dolphin, to be made into tools of various kinds; and as I was very de&s;irous to gratify them, they were indulged, except when the &s;mith's time was too precious to be &s;pared. Oberea having received her hatchet, produced as much old iron as would have made another, with a reque&s;t that another might be made of it: in this, how|ever, I could not gratify her, upon which &s;he brought out a broken ax, and de&s;ired it might be mended; I was glad of an opportunity to compromi&s;e the difference between us: her ax was mended, and &s;he appeared to be content. They went away at night, and took with them the canoe, which had been a con&s;iderable time at the point, but promi&s;ed to return in three days.</P>
<P>On the 10th, I put &s;ome &s;eeds of melons and other plants into a &s;pot of ground which had been turned up for the pur|po&s;e; they had all been &s;ealed up by the per&s;on of whom they were bought, in &s;mall bottles with ro&s;in; but none of them came up except mu&s;tard; even the cucumbers and melons failed, and Mr. Banks is of opinion that they were &s;poiled by the total exclu&s;ion of fre&s;h air.</P>
<P>This day we learnt the Indian name of the i&s;land, which is OTAHEITE, and by that name I &s;hall hereafter di&s;tingui&s;h it: but after great pains taken we found it utterly impo&s;&s;ible to teach the Indians to pronounce our names; we had, therefore, new names, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch &s;ounds as they produced in the attempt. They called me <HI>Too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">;</HI> Mr. Hicks, <HI>Hele;</HI> Molineux they renounced in ab&s;olute de&s;pair, and called the Ma&s;ter <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a,</HI> from his Chri&s;tian name Robert; Mr. Gore was <HI>Toarro;</HI> Dr. Solander, <HI>Torano;</HI> and Mr. Banks, <HI>Topane;</HI> Mr. Green, <HI>Eteree;</HI> Mr. Parkin&s;on, <HI>Patini;</HI> Mr. Sporing, <HI>Polini;</HI> Peter&s;|gill, <HI>Petrodero;</HI> and in this manner they had now formed names

for almo&s;t every man in the &s;hip: in &s;ome, however, it was not ea&s;y to find any traces of the original, and they were perhaps not mere arbitrary &s;ounds formed upon the occa&s;ion, but &s;ignificant words in their own language. Monkhou&s;e, the Mid&s;hipman, who commanded the party that killed the man for &s;tealing the mu&s;quet, they called <HI>Matte;</HI> not merely by an attempt to imitate in &s;ound the fir&s;t &s;yllable of Monk|hou&s;e, but becau&s;e <HI>Matte</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>dead;</HI> and this probably might be the ca&s;e with others.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Some Ladies vi&s;it the Fort with very uncommon Ceremonies: The Indians attend Divine Service, and in the Evening exhibit a mo&s;t extraordinary Spectacle: Tubourai Tamaide falls into Temptation.</HEAD>
<P>FRIDAY, the 12th of May, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a vi&s;it from &s;ome ladies whom we had never &s;een before, and who introduced them&s;elves with &s;ome very &s;ingular ceremo|nies. Mr. Banks was trading in his boat at the gate of the fort as u&s;ual, in company with Tootahah, who had that morn|ing paid him a vi&s;it, and &s;ome other of the natives; between nine and ten o'clock, a double canoe came to the landing-place, under the awning of which &s;at a man and two women: the Indians that were about Mr. Banks, made &s;igns that he &s;hould go out to meet them, which he ha&s;ted to do; but by the time he could get out of the boat, they had advanced within ten yards of him: they then &s;topped, and made &s;igns that he &s;hould do &s;o too, laying down about a dozen young plantain trees, and &s;ome other &s;mall plants: he complied, and the people having made a lane between them, the man, who ap|peared to be a &s;ervant, brought them to Mr. Banks by one of each at a time, pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing &s;ix times, and always pro|nouncing a &s;hort &s;entence when he delivered them. Tupia, who &s;tood by Mr. Banks, acted as his ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, and receiving the branches as they were brought, laid them down in the boat. When this was done, another man brought a large bundle of cloth, which having opened, he &s;pread piece by piece upon the ground, in the &s;pace between Mr. Banks and his vi&s;itors; there were nine pieces, and having laid three pieces one upon another, the foremo&s;t of the women, who &s;eemed to be the principal, and who was called OORATTOOA, &s;tepped upon them, and taking up her garments all round her to the wai&s;t, turned about, with great compo&s;ure and delibera|tion, and with an air of perfect innocence and &s;implicity, three
<PB N="78" REF="013324_0105_0F90F0A0AFBDD8F8">
times; when this was done, &s;he dropped the veil, and &s;tepping off the cloth, three more pieces were laid on, and &s;he repeated the ceremony, then &s;tepping off as before; the la&s;t three were laid on, and the ceremony was repeated in the &s;ame manner the third time. Immediately after this the cloth was rolled up, and given to Mr. Banks, as a pre&s;ent from the lady, who, with her friend, came up and &s;aluted him. He made &s;uch pre&s;ents to them both as he thought would be mo&s;t acceptable, and after having &s;taid about an hour they went away. In the evening, the Gentlemen at the fort had a vi&s;it from Oberea, and her favourite female attendant, who&s;e name was OTHEO|THEA, an agreeable girl, whom they were the more plea&s;ed to &s;ee, becau&s;e, having been &s;ome days ab&s;ent, it had been re|ported that &s;he was either &s;ick or dead.</P>
<P>On the 13th, the market being over about ten o'clock, Mr. Banks walked into the woods with his gun, as he generally did, for the benefit of the &s;hade in the heat of the day: as he was returning back, he met Tubourai Tamaide, near his oc|ca&s;ional dwelling, and &s;topping to &s;pend a little time with him, he &s;uddenly took the gun out of Mr. Banks's hand, cocked it, and, holding it up in the air, drew the trigger: fortunately for him, it fla&s;hed in the pan: Mr. Banks immediately took it from him, not a little &s;urpri&s;ed how he had acquired &s;ufficient knowledge of a gun to di&s;charge it, and reproved him with great &s;everity for what he had done. As it was of infinite im|portance to keep the Indians totally ignorant of the manage|ment of fire-arms, he had taken every opportunity of intimat|ing that they could never offend him &s;o highly as by even touch|ing his piece; it was now proper to enforce this prohibition, and he therefore added threats to his reproof: the Indian bore all patiently; but the moment Mr. Banks cro&s;&s;ed the river, he &s;et off with all his family and furniture for his hou&s;e at Eparre. This being quickly known from the Indians at the fort, and great inconvenience being apprehended from the di&s;plea&s;ure of this man, who upon all occa&s;ions had been particularly u&s;eful, Mr. Banks determined to follow him without delay, and &s;olicit his return: he &s;et out the &s;ame evening, accompanied by Mr. Mollineux, and found him &s;itting in the middle of a large circle of people, to whom he had probably related what had hap|pened, and his fears of the con&s;equences; he was him&s;elf the very picture of grief and dejection, and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions were &s;trongly marked in the countenances of all the people that &s;ur|rounded him. When Mr. Banks and Mr. Mollineux went into the circle, one of the women expre&s;&s;ed her trouble, as Terapo had done upon another occa&s;ion, and &s;truck a &s;hark's tooth into her head &s;everal times, till it was covered with blood. Mr. Ban&s;ts lo&s;t no time in putting an end to this univer&s;al di&s;|tre&s;s; he a&s;&s;ured the Chief, that every thing which had pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="79" REF="013324_0106_0F904D24DD83CD28">
&s;hould be forgotten, that there was not the lea&s;t animo&s;ity re|maining on one &s;ide, nor any thing to be feared on the other. The Chief was &s;oon &s;oothed into confidence and complacency, a double canoe was ordered to be got ready, they all returned together to the fort before &s;upper, and as a pledge of perfect reconciliation, both he and his wife &s;lept all night in Mr. Banks's tent: their pre&s;ence, however, was no palladium; for, between eleven and twelve o'clock, one of the natives attempted to get into the fort by &s;caling the walls, with a de&s;ign, no doubt, to &s;teal whatever he &s;hould happen to find; he was di&s;|covered by the centinel, who happily did not fire, and he ran away much fa&s;ter than any of our people could follow him. The iron, and iron-tools, which were in continual u&s;e at the armourer's forge, that was &s;et up within the works, were temp|tations to theft which none of the&s;e people could with&s;tand.</P>
<P>On the 14th, which was Sunday, I directed that Divine Service &s;hould be performed at the fort: we were de&s;irous that &s;ome of the principal Indians &s;hould be pre&s;ent, but when the hour came, mo&s;t of them were returned home. Mr. Banks, however, cro&s;&s;ed the river, and brought back Tubourai Ta|maide and his wife Tomio, hoping that it would give occa&s;ion to &s;ome enquiries on their part, and &s;ome in&s;truction on ours: having &s;eated them, he placed him&s;elf between them, and during the whole &s;ervice, they very attentively ob&s;erved his behaviour, and very exactly imitated it; &s;tanding, &s;itting, or kneeling, as they &s;aw him do: they were con&s;cious that we were employed about &s;omewhat &s;erious and important, as ap|peared by their calling to the Indians without the fort to be &s;ilent; yet when the &s;ervice was over, neither of them a&s;ked any que&s;tions, nor would they attend to any attempt that was made to explain what had been done.</P>
<P>Such were our Matins; our Indians thought fit to perform Ve&s;pers of a very different kind. A young man, near &s;ix feet high, performed the rites of Venus with a little-girl about eleven or twelve years of age, before &s;everal of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r people, and a great number of the natives, without the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of its being indecent or improper, but, as appeared, in perfect conformity to the cu&s;tom of the pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce. Among the &s;pectators were &s;everal women of &s;uperior rank, particularly Oberea, who may proper|ly be &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the ceremony; for they gave in|&s;tructions to the girl how to perform her part, which, young as &s;he was, &s;he did not &s;eem much to &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>This incident is not mentioned as an object of idle curio&s;ity, but as it de&s;erves con&s;ideration in determining a que&s;tion which has been long debated in philo&s;ophy; Whether the &s;hame at|tending certain actions, which are allowed on all &s;ides to be in them&s;elves innocent, is implanted in Nature, or &s;uperinduced by cu&s;tom? If it has its origin in cu&s;tom, it will, perhaps, be
<PB N="80" REF="013324_0107_0F90F0A16FD8A070">
found difficult to trace that cu&s;tom, however general, to its &s;ource; if in in&s;tinct, it will be equally difficult to di&s;cover from what cau&s;e it is &s;ubdued or at lea&s;t over-ruled among the&s;e people, in who&s;e manners not the lea&s;t trace of it is to be found.</P>
<P>On the 14th and 15th, we had another opportunity of ob|&s;erving the general knowledge which the&s;e people had of any de&s;ign that was formed among them. In the night between the 13th and 14th, one of the water-ca&s;ks was &s;tolen from the out&s;ide of the fort: in the morning, there was not an Indian to be &s;een who did not know that it was gone; yet they ap|peared not to have been tru&s;ted, or not to have been worthy of tru&s;t; for they &s;eemed all of them di&s;po&s;ed to give intellig|ence where it might be found. Mr. Banks traced it to a part of the bay where he was told it had been put into a canoe, but as it was not of great con&s;equence he did not complete the di&s;|covery. When he returned, he was told by Tubourai Ta|maide, that another ca&s;k would be &s;tolen before the morning: how he came by his knowledge it is not ea&s;y to imagine; that he was not a party in the de&s;ign is certain, for he came with his wife and his family to the place where the water ca&s;ks &s;tood, and placing their beds near them, he &s;aid he would him&s;elf be a pledge for their &s;afety, in de&s;pight of the thief: of this, however, we would not admit; and making him under&s;tand that a &s;entry would be placed to watch the ca&s;ks till the morn|ing, he removed the beds into Mr. Banks's tent, where he and his family &s;pent the night, making &s;igns to the &s;entry when he retired, that he &s;hould keep his eyes open. In the night this intelligence appeared to be true; about twelve o'clock the thief came, but di&s;covering that a watch had been &s;et, he went away without his booty.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks's confidence in Tubourai Tamaide had greatly increa&s;ed &s;ince the affair of the knife, in con&s;equence of which he was at length expo&s;ed to temptations which neither his in|tegrity nor his honour was able to re&s;i&s;t. They had with&s;tood many allurements, but were at length en&s;nared by the fa&s;ci|nating charms of a ba&s;ket of nails; the&s;e nails were much larger than any that had yet been brought into trade, and had, with perhaps &s;ome degree of criminal negligence, been left in a corner of Mr. Banks's tent, to which the Chief had always free acce&s;s. One of the&s;e nails Mr. Banks's &s;ervant happened to &s;ee in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, upon his having inadvertently thrown back that part of his garment under which it was concealed. Mr. Banks being told of this, and knowing that no &s;uch thing had been given him, either as a pre&s;ent or in barter, imme|diately examined the ba&s;ket, and di&s;covered, that out of &s;even nails five were mi&s;&s;ing. He then, though not without great reluctance, charged him with the fact, which he immediately
<PB N="81" REF="013324_0108_0F904D2780D98780">
confe&s;&s;ed, and however, he might &s;uffer, was probably not more hurt than his accu&s;er. A demand was immediately made of re&s;titution; but this he declined, &s;aying, that the nails were at Eparre: however, Mr. Banks appearing to be much in ear|ne&s;t, and u&s;ing &s;ome threatening &s;igns, he thought fit to pro|duce one of them. He was then taken to the fort, to receive &s;uch judgment as &s;hould be given again&s;t him by the general voice.</P>
<P>After &s;ome deliberation, that we might not appear to think too lightly of his offence, he was told, that if he would bring the other four nails to the fort, it &s;hould be forgotten. To this condition he agreed; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay he did not fulfil it. In&s;tead of fetching the nails, he removed with his family before night, and took all his furniture with him.</P>
<P>As our long-boat had appeared to be leaky, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to examine her bottom, and, to my great &s;urprize, found it &s;o much eaten by the worms, that it was nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ary to give her a new one; no &s;uch accident had happened to the Dolphin's boats, as I was informed by the officers on board, and therefore it was a misfortune that I did not expect: I feared that the pinnace al&s;o might be nearly in the &s;ame con|dition; but, upon examining her, I had the &s;atisfaction to find that not a worm had touched her, though &s;he was built of the &s;ame wood, and had been as much in the water; the rea&s;on of this difference I imagine to be, that the long-boat was paid with varni&s;h of pine, and the pinnace painted with white lead and oil; the bottoms of all boats therefore which are &s;ent into this country &s;hould be painted like that of the pinnace, and the &s;hips &s;hould be &s;upplied with a good &s;tock, in order to give them a new coating when it &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Having received repeated me&s;&s;ages from Tootahah, that if we would pay him a vi&s;it he would acknowledge the favour by a pre&s;ent of four hogs, I &s;ent Mr. Hicks, my Fir&s;t Lieutenant, to try <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he could not procure the hogs upon ea&s;ier terms, with orders to &s;how him every civility in his power. Mr. Hicks found that he was removed from Eparre to a place called TET|TAHAH, five miles farther to the we&s;tward. He was received with great cordiality; one hog was immediately produced, and he was told that the other three, which were at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;hould be brought in the morning. Mr. Hicks readily con|&s;ented to &s;tay; but the morning came without the hogs, and it not being convenient to &s;tay longer, he returned in the evening, with the one that he had got.</P>
<P>On the 25th, Tubourai Tamaide and his wife Tomio made their appearance at the tent, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince he had been detected in &s;tealing the nails; he &s;eemed to be under &s;ome di&s;|content and apprehen&s;ion, yet he did not think fit to purcha&s;e our countenance and good-will by re&s;toring the four which he
<PB N="82" REF="013324_0109_0F90F0A90E99DAA0">
had &s;ent away. As Mr. Banks and the other Gentlemen treated him with a coolne&s;s and re&s;erve which did not at all tend to re&s;tore his peace or good-humour, his &s;tay was &s;hort, and his departure abrupt. Mr. Monkhou&s;e, the Surgeon, went the next morning in order to effect a reconciliation, by per&s;uading him to bring down the nails, but he could not &s;ucceed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Another Vi&s;it to Tootahah, with various Adventures: Extraordi|nary Amu&s;ement of the Indians, with Remarks upon it: Pre|parations to ob&s;erve the Tran&s;it of Venus, and what happened in the mean time at the Fort.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 27th, it was determined that we &s;hould pay our vi&s;it to Tootahah, though we were not very confident that we &s;hould receive the hogs for our pains. I therefore &s;et out early in the morning, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and three others, in the pinnace. He was now removed from Tettahah, where Mr. Hicks had &s;een him, to a place called ATAHOUROU, about &s;ix miles farther, and as we could not go above half way thither in the boat, it was almo&s;t evening before we arrived: we found him in his u&s;ual &s;tate, &s;itting under a tree, with a great crowd about him. We made our pre&s;ents in due form, con&s;i&s;ting of a yellow &s;tuff petticoat, and &s;ome other trifling articles, which were graciou&s;ly received; a hog was immediately ordered to be killed and dre&s;&s;ed for &s;upper, with a promi&s;e of more in the morning: however, as we were le&s;s de&s;irous of fea&s;ting upon our journey than of carrying back with us provi&s;ions, which would be more welcome at the fort, we procured a reprieve for the hog, and &s;upped upon the fruits of the country. As night now came on, and the place was crowded with many more than the hou&s;es and canoes would contain; there being Oberea with her attendants, and many other travellers whom we knew, we began to look out for lodg|ings. Our party con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix: Mr. Banks thought him&s;elf fortunate in being offered a place by Oberea in her canoe, and wi&s;hing his friends a good night, took his leave. He went to re&s;t early, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, and taking off his clothes, as was his con&s;tant practice, the nights being hot, Oberea kindly in&s;i&s;ted upon taking them into her own cu&s;tody, for otherwi&s;e &s;he &s;aid they would certainly be &s;tolen. Mr. Banks having &s;uch a &s;afeguard, re&s;igned him&s;elf to &s;leep with all imaginable tranquillity: but awaking about eleven o'clock, and wanting to get up, he &s;earched for his clothes where he had &s;een them depo&s;ited by Oberea when he lay down
<PB N="83" REF="013324_0110_0F90F0A2319279B8">
to &s;leep, and &s;oon perceived that they were mi&s;&s;ing. He im|mediately awakened Oberea, who &s;tarting up, and hearing his complaint, ordered lights, and prepared in great ha&s;te to re|cover what he had lo&s;t: Tootahah him&s;elf &s;lept in the next canoe, and being &s;oon alarmed, he came to them and &s;et out with Oberea in &s;earch of he thief: Mr. Banks was not in a condition to go with them, for of his apparel &s;carce any thing was left him but his breeches; his coat, and his wai&s;tcoat, with his pi&s;tols, powder-horn, and many other things that were in the pockets, were gone. In about half an hour his two noble friends returned, but without having obtained any intelligence of his clothes or of the thief. At fir&s;t he began to be alarmed, his mu&s;quet had not indeed been taken away, but he had neglected to load it; where I and Dr. Solander had di&s;po&s;ed of our&s;elves he did not know; and therefore, whatever might happen, he could not have recour&s;e to us for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He thought it be&s;t, however, to expre&s;s neither fear nor &s;u&s;pi|cion of tho&s;e about him, and giving his mu&s;quet to Tupia, who had been waked in the confu&s;ion and &s;tood by him, with a charge not to &s;uffer it to be &s;tolen, he betook him&s;elf again to re&s;t, declaring him&s;elf perfectly &s;atisfied with the pains that Tootahah and Oberea had taken to recover his things, though they had not been &s;ucce&s;sful. As it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that in &s;uch a &s;ituation his &s;leep was very &s;ound, he &s;oon after heard mu&s;ic, and &s;aw lights at a little di&s;tance on &s;hore: this was a concert or a&s;&s;embly, which they call a a HEIVA, a common name for every public exhibition; and as it would nece&s;&s;arily bring many people together, and there was a chance of my being among them with his other friends, he ro&s;e, and made the be&s;t of his way towards it: he was &s;oon led by the lights and the &s;ound to the hut where I lay, with three other Gentle|men of our party; and ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hing us from the re&s;t, he made up to us more than half naked, and told us his melan|choly &s;tory. We gave him &s;uch comfort as the unfortunate generally give to each other, by telling him that we were fellow-&s;ufferers; I &s;howed him that I was my&s;elf without &s;tock|ings, they having been &s;tolen from under my head, though I was &s;ure I had never been a&s;leep, and each of my a&s;&s;ociates con|vinced him, by his appearance, that he had lo&s;t a jacket. We determined, however, to hear out the concert, however de|ficient we might appear in our dre&s;s; it con&s;i&s;ted of three drums, four flutes, and &s;everal voices: when this entertain|ment, which la&s;ted about an hour, was over, we retired again to our &s;leeping-places; having agreed, that nothing could be done toward the recovery of our things till the morning.</P>
<P>We ro&s;e at day-break, according to the cu&s;tom of the coun|try; the fir&s;t man that Mr. Banks &s;aw was Tupia, faithfully attending with his mu&s;quet; and &s;oon after, Oberea brought
<PB N="84" REF="013324_0111_0F90F0A6B8B3CEE0">
him &s;ome of her country clothes, as a &s;uccedaneum for his own, &s;o that when he came to us he made a mo&s;t motley appearance, half Indian and half Engli&s;h. Our party &s;oon got together, except Dr. Solander, who&s;e quarters we did not know, and who had not a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the concert: in a &s;hort time Tootahah made his appearance, and we pre&s;&s;ed him to recover our clothes; but neither he nor Oberea could be per&s;uaded to take any mea&s;ure for that purpo&s;e, &s;o that we began to &s;u&s;pect that they had been parties in the theft. About eight o'clock, we were joined by Dr. Solander, who had fallen into hone&s;ter hands, at a hou&s;e about a mile di&s;tant, and had lo&s;t nothing.</P>
<P>Having given up all hope of recovering our clothes, which indeed were never afterwards heard of, we &s;pent all the morn|ing in &s;oliciting the hogs which we had been promi&s;ed; but in this we had no better &s;ucce&s;s: we therefore, in no very good humour, &s;et out for the boat about twelve o'clock, with only that which we had redeemed from the butcher and the cook the night before.</P>
<P>As we were returning to the boat, however, we were enter|tained with a &s;ight that in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ated for our fatigue and di&s;appointment. In our way we came to one of the few places where acce&s;s to the i&s;land is not guarded by a reef, and, con&s;equently, a high &s;urf breaks upon the &s;hore; a more dreadful one indeed I had &s;eldom &s;een; it was impo&s;&s;ible for any European boat to have lived in it; and if the be&s;t &s;wimmer in Europe had, by any accident, been expo&s;ed to its fury, I am confident that he would not have been able to pre|&s;erve him&s;elf from drowning, e&s;pecially as the &s;hore was covered with pebbles and large &s;tones; yet, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e breakers, were ten or twelve Indians &s;wimming for their amu&s;ement: whenever a &s;urf broke near them, they dived under it, and, to all appearance with infinite facility, ro&s;e again on the other &s;ide. This diver&s;ion was greatly improved by the &s;tern of an old canoe, which they happened to find upon the &s;pot; they took this before them, and &s;wam out with it as far as the outer|mo&s;t breach, then two or three of them getting into it, and turning the &s;quare end to the breaking wave, were driven in towards the &s;hore with incredible rapidity, &s;ometimes almo&s;t to the beach; but generally the wave broke over them before they got half way, in which ca&s;e they dived, and ro&s;e on the other &s;ide with the canoe in their hands: they then &s;wam out with it again, and were again driven back, ju&s;t as our holiday youth climb the hill in Greenwich park for the plea&s;ure of rolling down it. At this wonderful &s;cene we &s;tood gazing for more than half an hour, during which time none of the &s;wimmers attempted to come on &s;hore, but &s;eemed to enjoy their &s;port in the highe&s;t degree; we then proceeded in our journey, and late in the evening got back to the fort.</P>

Upon this occa&s;ion it may be ob&s;erved, that human nature is endued with powers which are only accidentally exerted to the utmo&s;t; and that all men are capable of what no man attains, except he is &s;timulated to the effort by &s;ome uncommon cir|cum&s;tances or &s;ituation. The&s;e Indians effected what to us ap|peared to be &s;upernatural, merely by the application of &s;uch powers as they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common with us, and all other men who have no particular infirmity or defect. The truth of the ob&s;ervation is al&s;o manife&s;t from more familiar in&s;tances. The rope-dancer and balance-ma&s;ter owe their art, not to any pecu|liar liberality of Nature, but to an accidental improvement of her common gifts; and though equal diligence and applica|tion would not always produce equal excellence in the&s;e, any more than in other arts; yet there is no doubt but that a certain degree of proficiency in them might be univer&s;ally attained. Another proof of the exi&s;tence of abilities in mankind, that are almo&s;t univer&s;ally dormant, is furni&s;hed by the attainments of blind men. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the lo&s;s of one &s;en&s;e, like the amputation of a branch from a tree, gives new vigour to tho&s;e that remain. Every man's hearing and touch, there|fore, are capable of the nice di&s;tinctions which a&s;toni&s;h us in tho&s;e that have lo&s;t their &s;ight, and if they do not give the &s;ame intelligence to the mind, it is merely becau&s;e the &s;ame intelligence is not required of them: he that can &s;ee may do from choice what the blind do by nece&s;&s;ity, and by the &s;ame diligent attention to the other &s;en&s;es, may receive the &s;ame notices from them; let it therefore be remembered as an en|couragement to per&s;evering diligence, and a principle of ge|neral u&s;e to mankind, that he who does all he can, will ever effect much more than is generally thought to be po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Among other Indians that had vi&s;ited us, there were &s;ome from a neighbouring i&s;land which they called EIMEO or IMAO, the &s;ame to which Captain Wallis had given the name of the Duke of York's i&s;land, and they gave us an account of no le&s;s than two and twenty i&s;lands that lay in the neighbourhood of Otaheite.</P>
<P>As the day of ob&s;ervation now approached, I determined in con&s;equence of &s;ome hints which had been given me by Lord Morton, to &s;end out two parties to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it from other &s;ituations; hoping, that if we &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail at Otaheite, they might have better &s;ucce&s;s. We were, therefore, now bu&s;ily employed in preparing our in&s;truments, and in&s;tructing &s;uch Gentlemen in the u&s;e of them as I intended to &s;end out.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 1&s;t of June, the Saturday following being the day of the Tran&s;it, I di&s;patched Mr. Gore in the long-boat to Imao, with Mr. Monkhou&s;e and Mr. Sporing, a Gentle|man belonging to Mr. Banks, Mr. Green having furni&s;hed them with proper in&s;truments. Mr. Banks him&s;elf thought fit
<PB N="86" REF="013324_0113_0F90F0ABFAC63BF0">
to go upon this expedition, and &s;everal natives, particularly Tubourai Tamaide and Tomio, were al&s;o of the party. Very early on the Friday morning, I &s;ent Mr. Hicks, with Mr. Clerk and Mr. Peter&s;gill, the Ma&s;ter's Mates, and Mr. Saunders, one of the Mid&s;hipmen, in the pinnace to the ea&s;tward, with orders to fix on &s;ome convenient &s;pot, at a di&s;tance from our principal ob&s;ervatory, where they al&s;o might employ the in&s;truments with which they had been furni&s;hed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The long-boat not having been got ready till Thur&s;day in the afternoon, though all po&s;&s;ible expedition was u&s;ed to fit her out; the people on board, after having rowed mo&s;t part of the night, brought her to a grappling ju&s;t under the land of Imao. Soon after day-break, they &s;aw an Indian canoe, which they hailed, and the people on board &s;hewed them an inlet through the reef into which they pulled, and &s;oon fixed upon a coral rock, which ro&s;e out of the water about one hundred and fifty yards from the &s;hore, as a proper &s;ituation for their ob&s;ervatory: it was about eighty yards long and twenty broad, and in the middle of it was a bed of white &s;and, large enough for the tents to &s;tand upon. Mr. Gore and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants im|mediately began to &s;et them up, and make other nece&s;&s;ary pre|parations for the important bu&s;ine&s;s of the next day. While this was doing, Mr. Banks, with the Indians of Otaheite, and the people whom they had met in the canoe, went a&s;hore upon the main i&s;land, to buy provi&s;ions; of which he procured a &s;ufficient &s;upply before night. When he returned to the rock he found the ob&s;ervatory in order, and the tele&s;copes all fixed and tried. The evening was very fine, yet their &s;olicitude did not permit them to take much re&s;t in the night: one or other of them was up every half hour, who &s;atisfied the impatience of the re&s;t by reporting the changes of the &s;ky; now encourag|ing their hope by telling them that it was clear, and now alarming their fears by an account that it was hazey.</P>
<P>At day-break they got up, and had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee the &s;un ri&s;e, without a cloud. Mr. Banks then, wi&s;hing the ob&s;ervers, Mr. Gore and Mr. Monkhou&s;e, &s;ucce&s;s, repaired again to the i&s;land, that he might examine its produce, and get a fre&s;h &s;upply of provi&s;ions: he began by trading with the natives, for which purpo&s;e he took his &s;tation under a tree; and to keep them from pre&s;&s;ing upon him in a crowd, he drew a circle round him, which he &s;uffered none of them to enter.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock, he &s;aw two canoes coming towards the place, and was given to under&s;tand by the people about him, that they belonged to TARRAO, the King of the i&s;land, who was coming to make him a vi&s;it. As &s;oon as the canoes came near the &s;hore, the people made a lane from the beach to the trading-place, and his Maje&s;ty landed, with his &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e name was NUNA; as they advanced towards the tree where Mr.
<PB N="87" REF="013324_0114_0F90F0ACC4A4FED0">
Banks &s;tood, he went out to meet them, and, with great for|mality, introduced them into the circle from which the other natives had been excluded. As it is the cu&s;tom of the&s;e people to &s;it during all their conferences, Mr. Banks unwrapped a kind of Turban of Indian cloth, which he wore upon his head in&s;tead of a hat, and &s;preading it upon the ground, they all &s;at down upon it together. The royal pre&s;ent was then brought, which con&s;i&s;ted of a hog and a dog, &s;ome bread-fruit, cocoa|nuts, and other articles of the like kind. Mr. Banks then di&s;|patched a canoe to the ob&s;ervatory for his pre&s;ent, and the me&s;&s;engers &s;oon returned with an adze, a &s;hirt, and &s;ome beads, which were pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, and received with great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>By this time, Tubourai Tamaide and Tomio joined them, from the ob&s;ervatory. Tomio &s;aid, that &s;he was related to Tarrao, and brought him a pre&s;ent of a long nail, at the &s;ame time complimenting Nuna with a &s;hirt.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t internal contact of the planet with the &s;un being over, Mr. Banks returned to the ob&s;ervatory, taking Tarrao, Nuna, and &s;ome of their principal attendants, among whom were three very hand&s;ome young women, with him: he &s;hewed them the planet upon the &s;un, and endeavoured to make them under&s;tand that he and his companions had come from their own country on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it. Soon after, Mr. Banks re|turned with them to the i&s;land, where he &s;pent the re&s;t of the day in examining its produce, which he found to be much the &s;ame with that of Otaheite. The people whom he &s;aw there al&s;o exactly re&s;embled the inhabitants of that i&s;land, and many of them were per&s;ons whom he had &s;een upon it; &s;o that all tho&s;e whom he had dealt with, knew of what his trading ar|ticles con&s;i&s;ted, and the value they bore.</P>
<P>The next morning, having &s;truck the tents, they &s;et out on their return, and arrived at the &s;ort before night.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation was made with equal &s;ucce&s;s by the per&s;ons whom I had &s;ent to the ea&s;tward, and at the fort, there not being a cloud in the &s;ky from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting of the &s;un, the whole pa&s;&s;age of the planet Venus over the &s;un's di&s;k was ob&s;erved with great advantage by Mr. Green, Dr. So|lander, and my&s;elf; Mr. Green's tele&s;cope and mine were of the &s;ame magnifying power, but that of Dr. Solander was greater. We all &s;aw an atmo&s;phere or du&s;ky cloud round the body of the planet, which very much di&s;turbed the times of contact, e&s;pecially of the internal ones; and we differed from each other in our accounts of the times of the contacts much more than might have been expected. According to Mr. Green.

The latitude of the ob&s;ervatory was found to be 17&deg; 29&prime; 15"; and the longitude 149&deg; 32&prime; 30" W. of Greenwich.

<P>But if we had rea&s;on to congratulate our&s;elves upon the &s;ucce&s;s of our ob&s;ervation, we had &s;carce le&s;s cau&s;e to regret the diligence with which that time had been improved by &s;ome of our people to another purpo&s;e. While the attention of the officers was engro&s;&s;ed by the Tran&s;it of Venus, &s;ome of the &s;hip's company broke into one of the &s;tore-rooms, and &s;tole a quantity of &s;pike nails, amounting to no le&s;s than one hundred weight: this was a matter of public and &s;erious concern; for the&s;e nails, if circulated by the people among the Indians, would do us irreparable injury, by reducing the value of iron, our &s;taple commodity. One of the thieves was detected, but only &s;even nails were found in his cu&s;tody. He was puni&s;hed with two dozen la&s;hes, but would impeach none of his accom|plices.</P>

<P>ON the 5th, we kept his Maje&s;ty's birth-day; for though it is the 4th, we were unwilling to celebrate it during the ab&s;ence of the two parties who had been &s;ent out to ob&s;erve the Tran&s;it. We had &s;everal of the Indian Chiefs at our enter|tainment, who drank his Maje&s;ty's health by the name of Ki|hiargo, which was the neare&s;t imitation they could produce of King George.</P>
<P>About this time died an old woman of &s;ome rank, who was related to Tomio, which gave us an opportunity to &s;ee how they di&s;po&s;ed of the body, and confirmed us in our opinion that the&s;e people, contrary to the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom of all other nations now known, never bury their dead. In the middle of a &s;mall &s;quare, neatly railed in with bamboo, the awning of a canoe was rai&s;ed upon two po&s;ts, and under this the body was depo|&s;ited upon &s;uch a frame as has before been de&s;cribed; it was
<PB N="89" REF="013324_0116_0F90EC7C2C3E81F0">
covered with fine cloth, and near it was placed bread-fruit, fi&s;h, and other provi&s;ions: we &s;uppo&s;ed that the food was placed there for the &s;pirit of the decea&s;ed, and con&s;equently, that the&s;e Indians had &s;ome confu&s;ed notion of a &s;eparate &s;tate; but upon our applying for further information to Tubourai Tamaide, he told us, that the food was placed there as an offering to their gods. They do not, however, &s;uppo&s;e, that the gods eat, any more than the Jews &s;uppo&s;ed that Jehovah could dwell in a hou&s;e: the offering is made here upon the &s;ame principle as the Temple was built at Jeru&s;alem, as an expre&s;&s;ion of reverence and gratitude, and a &s;olicitation of the more immediate pre|&s;ence of the Deity. In the front of the area was a kind of &s;tile, where the relations of the decea&s;ed &s;tood to pay the tribute of their &s;orrow; and under the awning were innumerable &s;mall pieces of cloth, on which the tears and blood of the mourners had been &s;hed; for in their paroxy&s;ms of grief it is a univer&s;al cu&s;tom to wound them&s;elves with the &s;hark's tooth. Within a few yards two occa&s;ional hou&s;es were &s;et up, in one of which &s;ome relations of the decea&s;ed con&s;tantly re&s;ided, and in the other the chief mourner, who is always a man, and who keeps there a very &s;ingular dre&s;s in which a ceremony is performed that will be de&s;cribed in its turn. Near the place where the dead are thus &s;et up to rot, the bones are afterwards buried.</P>
<P>What can have introduced among the&s;e people the cu&s;tom of expo&s;ing their dead above ground, till the fle&s;h is con&s;umed by putrefaction, and then burying the bones, it is perhaps im|po&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s; but it is remarkable, that AElian and Apol|lonius Rhodius impute a &s;imilar practice to the ancient inhabi|tants of Colchis, a country near Pontus in A&s;ia, now called Mingrelia; except that among them this manner of di&s;po&s;ing of the dead did extend to both &s;exes: the women they buried; but the men they wrapped in a hide, and hung up in the air by a chain. This practice among the Colchians is referred to a religious cau&s;e. The principal objects of their wor&s;hip were the earth and the air; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that, in con&s;equence of &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious notion, they devoted their dead to both. Whether the natives of Otaheite had any notion of the &s;ame kind, we were never able certainly to determine; but we &s;oon di&s;covered, that the repo&s;itories of their dead were al&s;o places of wor&s;hip. Upon this occa&s;ion it may be ob&s;erved, that no|thing can be more ab&s;urd than the notion that the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of a future life depends, in any degree, upon the di&s;|po&s;ition of the body when the &s;tate of probation is pa&s;t; yet that nothing is more general than a &s;olicitude about it. How|ever cheap we may hold any funeral rites which cu&s;tom has not familiari&s;ed, or &s;uper&s;tition rendered &s;acred, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gravely deliberate how to prevent their body from being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ken by the mattock and devoured by the worm, when it is no longer ca|pable
<PB N="90" REF="013324_0117_0F90F0AE45E25518">
of &s;en&s;ation; and purcha&s;e a place for it in holy ground, when they believe the lot of its future exi&s;tence to be irrevoca|bly determined. So &s;trong is the a&s;&s;ociation of plea&s;ing or pain|ful ideas with certain opinions and actions which affect us while we live, that we involuntarily act as if it was equally certain that they would affect us in the &s;ame manner when we are dead, though this is an opinion that nobody will maintain. Thus it happens, that the de&s;ire of pre&s;erving from reproach even the name that we leave behind us, or of procuring it honour, is one of the mo&s;t powerful principles of action, among the inhabitants of the mo&s;t &s;peculative and enlightened nations. Po&s;thumous reputation, upon every principle, mu&s;t be acknow|ledged to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o influence upon the dead; yet the de&s;ire of obtaining and &s;ecuring it, no force of rea&s;on, no habits of thinking can &s;ubdue, except in tho&s;e whom habitual ba&s;ene&s;s and guilt have rendered indifferent to honour and &s;hame while they lived. This indeed &s;eems to be among the happy imper|fections of our nature, upon which the general good of &s;ociety in a certain mea&s;ure depends; for as &s;ome crimes are &s;uppo&s;ed to be prevented by hanging the body of the criminal in chains after he is dead, &s;o in con&s;equence of the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, much good is produced to &s;ociety, and much evil pre|vented, by a de&s;ire of preventing di&s;grace or procuring honour to a name, when nothing but a name remains.</P>
<P>Perhaps no better u&s;e can be made of reading an account of manners altogether new, by which the follies and ab&s;urdities of mankind are taken out of that particular connection in which habit has reconciled them to us, than to con&s;ider in how many in&s;tances they are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame. When an hone&s;t devo|tee of the church of Rome reads, that there are Indians on the banks of the Ganges, who believe that they &s;hall &s;ecure the happine&s;s of a future &s;tate by dying with a cow's tail in their hands, he laughs at their folly and &s;uper&s;tition; and if the&s;e people were to be told, that there are people upon the conti|nent of Europe, who imagine that they &s;hall derive the &s;ame advantage from dying with a &s;lipper of a St. Francis upon their foot, they would laugh in their turn. But if when the Indian heard the account of the Catholic, and the Catholic that of the Indian, each was to reflect, that there was no dif|ference between the ab&s;urdity of the &s;lipper and of the tail; but that the veil of prejudice and cu&s;tom, which covered it in their own ca&s;e, was withdrawn in the other, they would turn their knowledge to a profitable purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Having ob&s;erved that bread-fruit had for &s;ome days been brought in le&s;s quantities than u&s;ual, we enquired the rea&s;on; and were told, that there being a great &s;how of fruit upon the trees, they had been thinned all at once, in order to make a kind of four pa&s;te, which the natives call <HI>Mahie,</HI> and which
<PB N="91" REF="013324_0118_0F90F0AF091804A8">
in con&s;equence of having undergone a fermentation, will keep a con&s;iderable time, and &s;upply them with food when no ripe fruit is to be had.</P>
<P>On the 10th, the ceremony was to be performed, in honour of the old woman who&s;e &s;epulchral tabernacle has ju&s;t been de|&s;cribed, by the chief mourner; and Mr. Banks had &s;o great a curio&s;ity to &s;ee all the my&s;teries of the &s;olemnity, that he de|termined to take a part in it, being told, that he could be pre|&s;ent upon no other condition. In the evening, therefore, he repaired to the place where the body lay, and was received by the daughter of the decea&s;ed, and &s;everal other per&s;ons, among whom was a boy about fourteen years old, who were to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the ceremony. Tubourai Tamaide was to be the principal mourner; and his dre&s;s, was extremely fanta&s;tical, though not unbecoming. Mr. Banks was &s;tripped of his European clothes, and a &s;mall piece of cloth being tied round his middle, his body was &s;meared with charcoal and water, as low as the &s;houlders, till it was as black as that of a negroe: the &s;ame operation was performed upon &s;everal others, among whom were &s;ome women, who were reduced to a &s;tate as near to na|kedne&s;s as him&s;elf; the boy was blacked all over, and then the proce&s;&s;ion &s;et forward. Tubourai Tamaide uttered &s;omething, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a prayer, near the body; and did the &s;ame when he came up to his own hou&s;e: when this was done, the proce&s;&s;ion was continued towards the fort, permi&s;&s;ion having been obtained to approach it upon this occa&s;ion. It is the cu&s;tom of the Indians to fly from the&s;e proce&s;&s;ions with the utmo&s;t precipitation, &s;o that as &s;oon as tho&s;e who were about the fort, &s;aw it at a di&s;tance, they hid them&s;elves in the woods. It proceeded from the fort along the &s;hore, and put to flight another body of Indians, con&s;i&s;ting of more than an hundred, every one hiding him&s;elf under the fir&s;t &s;helter he could find; it then cro&s;&s;ed the river, and entered the woods, pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal hou&s;es, all which were de&s;erted, and not a &s;ingle Indian could be &s;een during the re&s;t of the proce&s;&s;ion, which continued more than half an hour. The office that Mr. Banks performed, was called that of the <HI>Nineveh,</HI> of which there were two be&s;ides him&s;elf; and the natives having all di&s;appeared, they came to the chief mourner, and &s;aid <HI>imitata,</HI> there are no people, after which the company was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to wa&s;h them&s;elves in the river, and put on their cu&s;tomary apparel.</P>
<P>On the 12th, complaint being made to me, by &s;ome of the natives, that two of the &s;eamen had taken from them &s;everal bows and arrows, and &s;ome &s;trings of plaited hair, I examined the matter, and finding the charge well &s;upported, I puni&s;hed each of the criminals with two dozen la&s;hes.</P>
<P>Their bows and arrows have not been mentioned before,
<PB N="92" REF="013324_0119_0F8FF51F78F67560">
nor were they often brought down to the fort: This day, however, Tubourai Tamaide brought down his, in con&s;e|quence of a challenge which he had received from Mr. Gore. The chief &s;uppo&s;ed it was to try who could &s;end the arrow far|the&s;t; Mr. Gore, who be&s;t could hit the mark: and as Mr. Gore did not value him&s;elf upon &s;hooting to a great di&s;tance, nor the chief upon hitting a mark, there was no trial of &s;kill between them. Tubourai Tamaide, however, to &s;hew us what he could do, drew his bow, and &s;ent an arrow, none of which are feathered, two hundred and &s;eventy-four yards, which is &s;omething more than a &s;eventh, and &s;omething le&s;s than a &s;ixth part of a mile. Their manner of &s;hooting is &s;omewhat &s;ingu|lar; they kneel down, and the moment the arrow is di&s;charged, drop the bow.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks, in his morning walk this day, met a number of the natives whom, upon enquiry, he found to be travelling mu&s;icians; and having learnt where they were to be at night, we all repaired to the place. The band con&s;i&s;ted of two flutes and three drums, and we found a great number of people a&s;|&s;embled upon the occa&s;ion. The drummers accompanied the mu&s;ic with their voices, and to our great &s;urprize, we di&s;co|vered that we were generally the &s;ubject of the &s;ong. We did not expect to have found among the uncivilized inhabitants of this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot, a character, which has been the &s;ub|ject of &s;uch prai&s;e and veneration where genius and knowledge have been mo&s;t con&s;picuous; yet the&s;e were the bards or min|&s;trels of Otaheite. Their &s;ong was unpremiditated, and ac|companied with mu&s;ic; they were, continually going about from place to place, and they were rewarded by the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, and the audience, with &s;uch things as one wanted and the other could &s;pare.</P>
<P>On the 14th, we were brought into new difficulties and in|convenience by another robbery at the fort. In the middle of the night, one of the natives contrived to &s;teal an iron coal-rake, that was made u&s;e of for the oven. It happened to be &s;et up again&s;t the in&s;ide of the wall, &s;o that the top of the handle was vi&s;ible from without; and we were informed that the thief, who had been &s;een lurking there in the evening, came &s;ecretly about three o'clock in the morning, and, watch|ing his opportunity when the centinel's back was turned, very dexterou&s;ly laid hold of it with a long crooked &s;tick, and drew it over the wall. I thought it of &s;ome con&s;equence, if po&s;&s;ible, to put an end to the&s;e practices at once, by doing &s;omething that &s;hould make it the common intere&s;t of the natives them|&s;elves, to prevent them. I had given &s;trict orders that they &s;hould not be fired upon, even when detected in the&s;e attempts, for which I had many rea&s;ons: the common centinels were by no means fit to be entru&s;ted with the power of life and death,
<PB N="93" REF="013324_0120_0F904D287A757828">
to be exerted whenever they &s;hould think fit, and I had already experienced that they were ready to take away the lives that were in their power, upon the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion; neither in|deed did I think that the thefts which the&s;e people committed again&s;t us, were, in them, crimes worthy of death: that thieves are hanged in England, I thought no rea&s;on why they &s;hould be &s;hot at Otaheite; becau&s;e, with re&s;pect to the natives, it would have been an execution by a law <HI>ex po&s;t facto:</HI> they had no &s;uch law among them&s;elves, and it did not appear to me that we had any right to make &s;uch a law for them. That they &s;hould ab&s;tain from theft, or be puni&s;hed with death, was not one of the conditions under which they claimed the advan|tages of civil &s;ociety, as it is among us; and as I was not wil|ling to expo&s;e them to fire arms, loaded with &s;hot, neither could I perfectly approve of firing only with powder: at fir&s;t indeed, the noi&s;e and the &s;moak would alarm them, but when they found that no mi&s;chief followed, they would be led to de&s;pi&s;e the weapons them&s;elves, and proceed to in&s;ults, which would make it nece&s;&s;ary to put them to the te&s;t, and from which they would be deterred by the very &s;ight of a gun, if it was never u&s;ed but with effect. At this time, an accident fur|ni&s;hed me with what I thought a happy expedient. It hap|pened that above twenty of their failing canoes were ju&s;t come in with a &s;upply of fi&s;h: upon the&s;e I immediately &s;eized, and bringing them into the river behind the fort, gave public no|tice, that except the rake, and all the re&s;t of the things which from time to time had been &s;tolen, were returned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hould be burnt. This menace I ventured to publi&s;h, though I had no de&s;ign to put it into execution, making no doubt but that it was well known in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the &s;tolen goods were, and that as re&s;titution was thus made a common cau&s;e, they would all of them in a &s;hort time be brought back. A li&s;t of the things was made out, con&s;i&s;ting principally of the rake, the mu&s;quet which had been taken from the marine when the Indian was &s;hot; the pi&s;tols which Mr. Banks lo&s;t with his clothes at Atahourou; a &s;word belonging to one of the petty-officers, and the water-ca&s;k. About noon, the rake was re&s;tored, and great &s;olicitation was made for the relea&s;e of the canoes; but I &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon my original condition. The next day came, and nothing farther was re&s;tored, at which I was much &s;urprized, for the people were in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for the fi&s;h, which in a &s;hort time would be &s;poiled; I was, therefore, re|duced to a di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, either of relea&s;ing the canoes, contrary to what I had &s;olemnly and publickly declared, or to detain them to the great injury of tho&s;e who were innocent, without an&s;wering any good purpo&s;e to our&s;elves: as a tem|porary expedient, I permitted them to take the fi&s;h; but &s;till detained the canoes. This very licence, however, was pro|ductive
<PB N="94" REF="013324_0121_0F8FF51F89672A60">
of new confu&s;ion and injury; for, it not being ea&s;y at once to di&s;tingui&s;h to what particular per&s;ons the &s;everal lots of fi&s;h belonged, the canoes were plundered, under favour of this circum&s;tance, by tho&s;e who had no right to any part of their cargo. Mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances were &s;till made that the canoes might be re&s;tored, and I having now the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, either that the things for which I detained them were not in the i&s;land, or that tho&s;e who &s;uffered by their de|tention had not &s;ufficient influence over the thieves to prevail upon them to relinqui&s;h their booty, determined at length to give them up, not a little mortified at the bad &s;ucce&s;s of my project.</P>
<P>Another accident al&s;o about this time was, notwith&s;tanding all our caution, very near embroiling us with the Indians. I &s;ent the boat on &s;hore with an officer to get balla&s;t for the &s;hip, and not immediately finding &s;tones convenient for the purpo&s;e, he began to pull down &s;ome part of an inclo&s;ure where they de|po&s;ited the bones of their dead: this the Indians violently op|po&s;ed, and a me&s;&s;enger came down to the tents to acquaint the officers that they would not &s;uffer it. Mr. Banks immediately repaired to the place, and an amicable end was &s;oon put to the di&s;pute, by &s;ending the boat's crew to the river, where &s;tones enough were to be gathered without a po&s;&s;ibility of giving of|fence. It is very remarkable, that the&s;e Indians appeared to be much more jealous of what was done to the dead than the living. This was the only mea&s;ure in which they ventured to oppo&s;e us, and the only in&s;ult that was offered to any indivi|dual among us was upon a &s;imilar occa&s;ion. Mr. Monkhou&s;e happening one day to pull a flower from a tree which grew in one of their &s;epulchral inclo&s;ures, an Indian, who&s;e jealou&s;y had probably been upon the watch, came &s;uddenly behind him, and &s;truck him: Mr. Monkhou&s;e laid hold of him, but he was in&s;tantly re&s;cued by two more, who took hold of Mr. Monk|hou&s;e's hair, and forced him to quit his hold of their com|panion, and then run away without offering him any farther violence.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 19th, while the canoes were &s;till de|tained, we received a vi&s;it from Oberea, which &s;urprized us not a little, as &s;he brought with her none of the things that had been &s;tolen, and knew that &s;he was &s;u&s;pected of having &s;ome of them in her cu&s;tody. She &s;aid indeed, that her favourite Obadee, whom &s;he had beaten and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, had taken them away; but &s;he &s;eemed con&s;cious, that &s;he had no right to be believed: &s;he di&s;covered the &s;tronge&s;t &s;igns of fear, yet &s;he &s;urmounted it with a&s;toni&s;hing re&s;olution; and was very pre&s;&s;ing to &s;leep with her attendants in Mr. Banks's tent. In this, however, &s;he was not gratified; the affair of the jackets was too recent, and the tent was be&s;ides filled with other people. No body el&s;e &s;eemed
<PB N="95" REF="013324_0122_0F904D2A3747B008">
willing to entertain her, and &s;he therefore, with great ap|pearance of mortification and di&s;appointment, &s;pent the night in her canoe.</P>
<P>The next morning early, &s;he returned to the fort, with her canoe and every thing that it contained, putting her&s;elf wholly into our power, with &s;omething like greatne&s;s of mind, which excited our wonder and admiration. As the mo&s;t effectual means to bring about a reconciliation, &s;he pre&s;ented us with a hog, and &s;everal other things, among which was a dog. We had lately learnt, that the&s;e animals were e&s;teemed by the Indians as more delicate food than their pork; and upon this occa&s;ion we determined to try the experiment: the dog, which was very fat, we con&s;igned over to Tupia, who undertook to perform the double office of butcher and cook. He killed him by holding his hands clo&s;e over his mouth and no&s;e, an opera|tion which continued above a quarter of an hour. While this was doing, a hole was made in the ground about a foot deep, in which a fire was kindled, and &s;ome &s;mall &s;tones placed in layers alternately with the wood to heat; the dog was then &s;inged by holding him over the fire, and by &s;craping him with a &s;hell, the hair taken off as clean as if he had been &s;calded in hot water: he was then cut up with the &s;ame in&s;trument, and his entrails being taken out, were &s;ent to the &s;ea, where being carefully wa&s;hed, they were put into cocoa-nut &s;hells, with what blood had come from the body: when the whole was &s;uf|ficiently heated, the fire was taken out, and &s;ome of the &s;tones, which were not &s;o hot as to di&s;colour any thing that they touched, being placed at the bottom, were covered with green leaves; the dog, with the entrails, was then placed upon the leaves, and other leaves being laid upon them, the whole was covered with the re&s;t of the hot &s;tones, and the mouth of the hole clo&s;e &s;topped with mould: in &s;omewhat le&s;s than four hours it was again opened, and the dog taken out excellently baked, and we all agreed that he made a very good di&s;h. The dogs which are here bred to be eaten, ta&s;te no animal food, but are kept wholly upon bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, yams, and other vegetables of the like kind; all the fle&s;h and fi&s;h eaten by the inhabitants is dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, we were vi&s;ited at the fort by a chief, called Oamo, whom we had never &s;een before, and who was treated by the natives with uncommon re&s;pect; he brought with him a boy about &s;even years old, and a young woman about &s;ixteen: the boy was carried upon a man's back, which we con&s;idered as a piece of &s;tate, for he was as well able to walk as any pre|&s;ent. As &s;oon as they were in &s;ight, Oberea, and &s;everal other natives who were in the fort, went out to meet them, having fir&s;t uncovered their heads and bodies as low as the wai&s;t; as they came on, the &s;ame ceremony was performed by all the
<PB N="96" REF="013324_0123_0F8FF5203B709938">
natives who were without the fort. Uncovering the body, therefore, is in this country probably a mark of re&s;pect; and as all parts are here expo&s;ed with equal indifference, the cere|mony of uncovering it from the wai&s;t downwards, which was performed by Oorattooa, might be nothing more than a dif|ferent mode of compliment, adapted to per&s;ons of a different rank. The chief came into the tent, but no entreaty could prevail upon the young woman to follow him, though &s;he &s;eemed to refu&s;e contrary to her inclination: the natives with|out were indeed all very &s;olicitous to prevent her; &s;ometimes when her re&s;olution &s;eemed to fail, almo&s;t u&s;ing force; the boy al&s;o they re&s;trained in the &s;ame manner; but Dr. Solander happening to meet him at the gate, took him by the hand, and led him in before the people were aware of it: as &s;oon, however, as tho&s;e that were within &s;aw him, they took care to have him &s;ent out.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances having &s;trongly excited our curio&s;ity, we enquired who they were, and were informed, that Oamo was the hu&s;band of Oberea, though they had been a long time &s;eparated by mutual con&s;ent; and that the young woman and the boy were their children. We learnt al&s;o, that the boy, who&s;e name was Terridiri, was heir apparent to the &s;overeignty of the i&s;land, and that his &s;i&s;ter was intended for his wife, the marriage being deferred only till he &s;hould arrive at a proper age. The &s;overeign at this time was a &s;on of Whappai, who&s;e name was Outou, and who, as before has been ob&s;erved, was a minor. Whappai, Oamo, and Tootahah, were brothers: Whappai was the elde&s;t, and Oama the &s;econd; &s;o that, Whappai, having no child but Outou, Terridiri, the &s;on of his next brother Oamo, was heir to the &s;overeignty. It will perhaps, &s;eem &s;trange that a boy &s;hould be &s;overeign during the life of his father; but according to the cu&s;tom of the country, a child &s;ucceeds to a father's title and authority as &s;oon as it is born: a regent is then elected, and the father of the new &s;overeign is generally continued in his authority, un|der that title, till his child is of age; but, at this time, the choice had fallen upon Tootahah, the uncle, in con&s;equence of his having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in a war. Oamo a&s;ked many que&s;tions concerning England and its inhabitants, by which he appeared to have great &s;hrewdne&s;s and under&s;tanding.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. An Account of the Circumnavigation of the I&s;land, and various Incidents that happened during the Expedition; with a De&s;crip|tion of a Burying-place, and Place of Wor&s;hip, called a Mo|rai.</HEAD>
<P>ON Monday the 26th, about three o'clock in the morn|ing, I &s;et out in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks, to make the circuit of the i&s;land, with a view to &s;ketch out the coa&s;t and harbours. We took our route to the ea&s;tward, and about eight in the forenoon we went on &s;hore, in a di&s;trict called OAHOUNUE, which is governed by AHIO, a young Chief, whom we had often &s;een at the tents, and who favoured us with his company to breakfa&s;t. Here al&s;o we found two other natives of our old acquaintance, TITU|BOALO and HOONA, who carried us to their hou&s;es, near which we &s;aw the body of the old woman, at who&s;e funeral rites Mr. Banks had a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and which had been removed hither from the &s;pot where it was fir&s;t depo&s;ited, this place having de&s;cended from her by inheritance to Hoona, and it be|ing nece&s;&s;ary on that account that it &s;hould lie here. We then proceeded on foot, the boat attending within call, to the harbour in which Mr. Bougainville lay, called OHIDEA, where the natives &s;hewed us the ground upon which his people pitched their tent, and the brook at which they watered, though no trace of them remained, except the holes where the poles of the tent had been fixed, and a &s;mall piece of pot&s;heard, which Mr. Banks found in looking narrowly about the &s;pot. We met, however, with ORETTE a Chief who was their principal friend, and who&s;e brother OUTORROU went away with them.</P>
<P>This harbour lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of a great bay, under &s;helter of a &s;mall i&s;land called BOOUROU, near which is an|other called TAAWIRRII; the breach in the reefs is here very large, but the &s;helter for the &s;hips is not the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Soon after we had examined this place, we took boat, and a&s;ked Tituboalo to go with us to the other &s;ide of the bay; but he refu&s;ed, and advi&s;ed as not to go, for he &s;aid the coun|try there was inhabited by people who were not &s;ubject to Tootahah, and who would kill both him and us. Upon re|ceiving this intelligence, we did not, as may be imagined, relinqui&s;h our enterprize; but we immediately loaded our pieces with ball: this was &s;o well under&s;tood by Tituboalo as a precaution which rendered us formidable, that he now con|&s;ented to be of our party.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="013324_0125_0F90F0B1DE3D97A8">
Having rowed till it was dark, we reached a low neck of land, or i&s;thmus, at the bottom of the bay, that divides the i&s;land into two penin&s;ulas, each of which is a di&s;trict or go|vernment wholly independent of the other. From Port-Royal, where the &s;hip was at anchor, the coa&s;t trends E. by S. and E. S. E. ten miles, then S. by E. and S. eleven miles to the i&s;thmus. In the fir&s;t direction, the &s;hore is in general open to the &s;ea; but in the la&s;t it is covered by reefs of rocks, which form &s;everal good harbours, with &s;afe anchorage, in 16, 18, 20, and 24 fathom of water, with other conveniences. As we had not yet got into our enemy's country, we deter|mined to &s;leep on &s;hore: we landed, and though we found but few hou&s;es, we &s;aw &s;everal double canoes who&s;e owners were well known to us, and who provided us with &s;upper and lodging; of which Mr. Banks was indebted for his &s;hare to Ooratooa, the lady who had paid him her compliments in &s;o &s;ingular a manner at the fort.</P>
<P>In the morning, we looked about the country, and found it to be a mar&s;hy flat, about two miles over, acro&s;s which the natives haul their canoes, to the corre&s;ponding bay on the other &s;ide. We then prepared to continue our rout for what Tituboalo called the other kingdom; he &s;aid that the name of it was TIARRABOU, or OTAHEITE ETE; and that of the Chief who governed it, WAHEATUA: upon this occa&s;ion al&s;o, we learnt that the name of the penin&s;ula where we had taken our &s;tation was OPOUREONU, or OTAHEITE NUE. Our new a&s;&s;ociate &s;eemed to be now in better &s;pirits than he had been the day before; the people in Tiarrabou would not kill us, he &s;aid, but he a&s;&s;ured us that we &s;hould be able to procure no victuals among them; and indeed we had &s;een no bread-fruit &s;ince we &s;et out.</P>
<P>After rowing a few miles, we landed in a di&s;trict, which was the dominion of a Chief called MARAITATA, the bury|ing-place of men; who&s;e father's name was PAHAIREDO, the &s;tealer of boats. Though the&s;e names &s;eemed to favour the account that had been given by Tituboalo, we &s;oon found that it was not true. Both the father and the &s;on received us with the greate&s;t civility, gave us provi&s;ions, and, after &s;ome delay, &s;old us a very large hog for a hatchet. A crowd &s;oon gathered round us, but we &s;aw only two people that we knew; neither did we ob&s;erve a &s;ingle bead or ornament among them that had come from our &s;hip, tho' we &s;aw &s;everal things which had been brought from Europe. In one of the hou&s;es lay two twelve-pound &s;hot, one of which was marked with the broad arrow of England, though the people &s;aid they had them from the &s;hips that lay in Bougainville's har|bour.</P>
<P>We proceeded on foot till we came to the di&s;trict which
<PB N="99" REF="013324_0126_0F90F0B2053688A0">
was immediately under the government of the principal Chief, or King of the penin&s;ula, Waheatua. Waheatua had a &s;on, but whether, according to the cu&s;tom of Opoureonu, he ad|mini&s;tered the government as regent, or in his own right is uncertain. This di&s;trict con&s;i&s;ts of a large and fertile plain, watered by a river &s;o wide, that we were obliged to ferry over it in a canoe; our Indian train, however, cho&s;e to &s;wim, and took to the water with the &s;ame facility as a pack of hounds. In this place we &s;aw no hou&s;e that appeared to be inhabited, but the ruins of many, that had been very large. We pro|ceeded along the &s;hore, which forms a bay, called OAITI|PEHA, and at la&s;t we found the Chief &s;itting near &s;ome pretty canoe awnings, under which, we &s;uppo&s;ed, he and his at|tendants &s;lept. He was a thin old man, with a very white head and beard, and had with him a comely woman, about five and twenty years old, who&s;e name was TOUDIDDE. We had often heard the name of this woman, and, from report and ob&s;ervation, we had rea&s;on to think that &s;he was the OBE|REA of this penin&s;ula. From this place, between which and the i&s;thmus there are other harbours, formed by the reefs that lie along the &s;hore, where &s;hipping may lie in perfect &s;ecurity, and from whence the land trends S. S. E. and S. to the S. E, part of the i&s;land, we were accompanied by TEAREE, the &s;on of Waheatua, of whom we had purcha&s;ed a hog, and the coun|try we pa&s;&s;ed through appeared to be more cultivated than any we had &s;een in other parts of the i&s;land: the brooks were every where banked into narrow channels with &s;tone, and the &s;hore had al&s;o a facing of &s;tone, where it was wa&s;hed by the &s;ea. The hou&s;es were neither large nor numerous, but the canoes, that were hauled up along the &s;hore were almo&s;t innu|merable, and &s;uperior to any that we had &s;een before, both in &s;ize and make; they were longer, the &s;terns were higher, and the awnings were &s;upported by pillars. At almo&s;t every point there was a &s;epulchral building, and there were many of them al&s;o in land. They were of the &s;ame figure as tho&s;e in Opou|reonu, but they were cleaner and better kept, and decorated with many carved boards, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch were &s;et upright, and on the top of which were various figures of birds and men: on one in particular there was a repre&s;entation of a cock, which was painted red and yellow, to imitate the feathers of that animal, and rude images of men were, in &s;ome of them placed one upon the head of another. But in this part of the coun|try, however fertile and cultivated, we did not &s;ee a &s;ingle bread-fruit; the trees were entirely bare, and the inhabitants &s;eemed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t principally upon nuts, which are not unlike a che&s;nut, and which they call <HI>Ahee.</HI></P>
<P>When we had walked till we were weary, we called up the boat, but both our Indians, Tetuboalo and Tuahow, were mi&s;|&s;ing;
<PB N="100" REF="013324_0127_0F90F0A3B32B8878">
they had, it &s;eems, &s;tayed behind at Waheatua's, ex|pecting us to return thither, in con&s;equence of a promi&s;e which had been extorted from us, and which we had it not in our power to fulfil.</P>
<P>Tearee, however, and another, embarked with us, and we proceeded till we came a-brea&s;t of a &s;mall i&s;land called OTOO|AREITE; it being then dark, we determined to land, and our Indians conducted us to a place where they &s;aid we might &s;leep: it was a de&s;erted hou&s;e, and near it was a little cove, in which the boat might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e with great &s;afety and convenience. We were, however, in want of provi&s;ions, having been very &s;pa|ringly &s;upplied &s;ince we &s;et out; and Mr. Banks immediately went into the woods to &s;ee whether any could be procured. As it was dark, he met with no people, and could find but one hou&s;e that was inhabited: a bread-fruit and a half, a few Ahees, and &s;ome fire, were all that it afforded; upon which, with a duck or two, and a few curlieus, we made our &s;upper, which, if not &s;canty, was di&s;agreeable by the want of bread, with which we had neglected to furni&s;h our&s;elves, as we de|pended upon meeting with bread-fruit, and took up our lodg|ing under the awning of a canoe, belonging to Tearee, which followed us.</P>
<P>The next morning, after having &s;pent &s;ome time in another fruitle&s;s attempt to procure a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, we pro|ceeded round the &s;outh-ea&s;t point, part of which is not covered by any reef, but lies open to the &s;ea; and here the hill ri&s;es directly from the &s;hore. At the &s;outhermo&s;t part of the i&s;land, the &s;hore is again covered by a reef, which forms a good har|bour; and the land about it is very fertile. We made this rout partly on foot, and partly in the boat: when we had walked about three miles, we arrived at a place where we &s;aw &s;everal large canoes, and a number of people with them, whom we were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find were of our intimate acquaintance. Here, with much difficulty, we procured &s;ome cocoa-nuts, and then embarked, taking with us Tuahow, one of the Indians who had waited for us at Waheatua's, and had returned the night before, long after it was dark.</P>
<P>When we came a-brea&s;t of the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, we went a&s;hore, by the advice of our Indian guide, who told us that the country was rich and good. The Chief, who&s;e name was MATHIABO, &s;oon came down to us, but &s;eemed to be a total &s;tranger both to us and to our trade: his &s;ubjects, however, brought us plenty of cocoa-nuts, and about twenty bread fruit. The bread-fruit we bought at a very dear rate, but his Excellency &s;old us a pig for a gla&s;s bottle, which he preferred to every thing el&s;e that we could give him. We found in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a goo&s;e and a turkey-cock, which, we were informed, had been left upon the i&s;land by the Dolphin:
<PB N="101" REF="013324_0128_0F904D2A70B8DEB0">
they were both enormou&s;ly fat, and &s;o tame that they followed the Indians, who were fond of them to exce&s;s, wherever they went.</P>
<P>In a long hou&s;e in this neighbourhood, we &s;aw what was altogether new to us. At one end of it, fa&s;tened to a &s;emicir|cular board, hung fifteen human jaw-bones; they appeared to be fre&s;h, and there was not one of them that wanted a &s;ingle tooth. A &s;ight &s;o extraordinary &s;trongly excited our cu|rio&s;ity, and we made many enquiries about it; but at this time could get no information, for the people either could not, or would not under&s;tand us.</P>
<P>When we left this place, the Chief, Mathiabo, de&s;ired leave to accompany us, which was readily granted. He con|tinued with us the remainder of the day, and proved very u&s;eful, by piloting us over the &s;hoals. In the evening, we opened the bay on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, which an|&s;wered to that on the &s;outh ea&s;t, &s;o as at the i&s;thmus, or car|rying place, almo&s;t to inter&s;ect the i&s;land, as I have ob&s;erved before; and when we had coa&s;ted about two thirds of it, we determined to go on &s;hore for the night. We &s;aw a large hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance, which, Mathiabo informed us, belonged to one of his friends; and &s;oon after &s;everal canoes came off to meet us, having on board &s;ome very hand&s;ome women, who, by their behaviour, &s;eemed to have been &s;een to entice us on &s;hore. As we had before re&s;olved to take up our re&s;idence here for the night, little invitation was nece&s;&s;ary. We found that the hou&s;e belonged to the Chief of the di&s;trict, who&s;e name was WIVEROU: He received us in a very friendly man|ner, and ordered his people to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in dre&s;&s;ing our provi|&s;ion, of which we had now got a tolerable &s;tock. When our &s;upper was ready, we were conducted into that part of the hou&s;e where Wiverou was &s;itting, in order to eat it; Mathia|bo &s;upped with us, and Wiverou calling for his &s;upper at the &s;ame time, we eat our meal very &s;ociably, and with great good humour. When it was over, we began to enquire where we were to &s;leep, and a part of the hou&s;e was &s;hewn us, of which we were told we might take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e. We then &s;ent for our cloaks, and Mr. Banks began to undre&s;s, as his cu&s;tom was, and, with a precaution which he had been taught by the lo&s;s of his jackets at Atahourou, &s;ent his clothes aboard the boat, propo&s;ing to cover him&s;elf with a piece of Indian cloth. When Mathiabo perceived what was doing, he al&s;o pretended to want a cloak; and, as he had behaved very well, and done us &s;ome &s;ervice, a cloak was ordered for him. We lay down, and ob&s;erved that Mathiabo was not with us; but we &s;uppo&s;ed that he was gone to bathe, as the Indians al|ways do before they &s;leep. We had not waited long, however, when an Indian, who was a &s;tranger to us, came and told Mr.
<PB N="102" REF="013324_0129_0F90F0A470DDDF58">
Banks that the cloak and Mathiabo had di&s;appeared together. This man had &s;o far gained our confidence, that we did not at fir&s;t believe the report; but it being &s;oon after confirmed by Tuahow, our own Indian, we knew no time was to be lo&s;t. As it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to pur&s;ue the thief, with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the people about us, Mr. Banks &s;tarted up, and telling our ca&s;e, required them to re|cover the cloak; and to enforce his requi&s;ition, &s;hewed one of his pocket pi&s;tols, which he always kept about him. Upon the &s;ight of the pi&s;tol, the whole company took the alarm, and, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting to catch the thief, or recover what had been &s;tolen, began with great precipitation to leave the place; one of them, however, was &s;eized, upon which he imme|diately offered to direct the chace: I &s;et out therefore with Mr. Banks, and though we ran all the way, the alarm had got before us, for in about ten minutes we met a man bring|ing back the cloak, which the thief had relinqui&s;hed in great terror; and as we did not then think fit to continue the pur|&s;uit, he made his e&s;cape. When we returned we found the hou&s;e, in which there had been between two and three hund|red people, entirely de&s;erted. It being, however, &s;oon known that we had no re&s;entment again&s;t any body but Mathiabo, the Chief Wiverou, our ho&s;t, with his wife and many others, returned, and took up their lodging with us for the night. In this place, however, we were de&s;tined to more confu&s;ion and trouble, for about five o'clock in the morning our &s;en|try alarmed us, with an account that the boat was mi&s;&s;ing: he had &s;een her, he &s;aid, about half an hour before, at her grappling, which was not above fifty yards from the &s;hore; but upon hearing the &s;ound of oars, he had looked out again, and could &s;ee nothing of her. At this account we &s;tarted up greatly alarmed, and ran to the water &s;ide: the morning was clear and &s;tar light, &s;o that we could &s;ee to a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, but there was no appearance of the boat. Our &s;ituation was now &s;uch as might ju&s;tify the mo&s;t terrifying apprehen|&s;ions; as it was a dead calm, and we could not therefore &s;up|po&s;e her to have broken from her grapling, we had great rea|&s;on to fear that the Indians had attacked her, and finding the people a&s;leep, had &s;ucceeded in their enterprize: we were but four, with only one mu&s;quet, and two pocket pi&s;tols, with|out a &s;pare ball or charge of powder for either. In this &s;tate of anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s we remained a con&s;iderable time, ex|pecting the Indians every moment to improve their advan|tage, when, to our un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction, we &s;aw the boat return, which had been driven from her grappling by the tide; a circum&s;tance to which, in our confu&s;ion and &s;urpri&s;e, we did not advert.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the boat returned, we got our breakfa&s;t, and
<PB N="103" REF="013324_0130_0F90F0B2B29E6F60">
were impatient to leave the place, le&s;t &s;ome other vexatious accident &s;hould befall us. It is &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of Tiarrabou, the &s;outh ea&s;t penin&s;ula, or divi&s;ion, of the i&s;land, and at the di&s;tance of about five miles &s;outh ea&s;t from the i&s;th|mus, having a large and commodious harbour, inferior to none in the i&s;land, about which the land is very rich in pro|duce. Notwith&s;tanding we had had little communication with this divi&s;ion, the inhabitants every where received us in a friendly manner; we found the whole of it fertile and popu|lous, and to all appearance, in a more flouri&s;hing &s;tate than Opoureonu, though it is not above one fourth part as large.</P>
<P>The next di&s;trict in which we landed, was the la&s;t in Ti|arrabou, and governed by a chief, who&s;e name we under&s;tood to be OMOE. Omoe was building a hou&s;e, and being there|fore very de&s;irous of procuring a hatchet, he would have been glad to have purcha&s;ed one with any thing that he had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it happened, however, rather unfortunately for him and us, that we had not one hatchet, left in the boat. We offered to trade with nails, but he would not part with any thing in exchange for them; we therefore reimbarked, and put off our boat, but the chief being unwilling to relinqui&s;h all hope of obtaining &s;omething from us that would be of u&s;e to him, embarked in a canoe, with his wife WHANNO-OUDA, and followed us. After &s;ome time, we took them into the boat, and when we had rowed about a league, they de&s;ired we would put a&s;hore: we immediately complied with his re|que&s;t, and found &s;ome of his people who had brought down a very large hog, we were as unwilling to lo&s;e the hog, as the chief was to part with us, and it was indeed worth the be&s;t ax we had in the &s;hip; we therefore hit upon an expedient, and told him, that if he would bring his hog to the fort at MAT|AVAI, the Indian name for Port Royal Bay, he &s;hould have a large axe, and a nail into the bargain, for his trouble. To this propo&s;al, after having con&s;ulted with his wife, he agreed, and gave us a large piece of his country cloth as a pledge that he would perform his agreement, which, however, he never did.</P>
<P>At this place we &s;aw a very &s;ingular curio&s;ity: it was the figure of a man, con&s;tructed of ba&s;ket work, rudely made, but not ill de&s;igned; it was &s;omething more than &s;even feet high, and rather too bulky in proportion to its height. The wicker &s;keleton was completely covered with feathers, which were white where the &s;kin was to appear, and black in the parts which it is their cu&s;tom to paint or &s;tain, and upon the head, where there was to be a repre&s;entation of hair: upon the head al&s;o were four protuberances, three in front and one behind, which we &s;hould have called horns, but which the Indians dignified with the name of TATE ETE, little men. The image was called MANIOE, and was &s;aid to be the only
<PB N="104" REF="013324_0131_0F90EC7CECE83740">
one of the kind in Otaheite. They attempted to give us an explanation of its u&s;e and de&s;ign, but we had not then acquir|ed enough of their language to under&s;tand them. We learnt, however, afterwards, that it was a repre&s;entation of Mauwe, one of their Eatuas, or gods of the &s;econd cla&s;s.</P>
<P>After having &s;ettled our affairs with Omoe, we proceeded on our return, and &s;oon reached Opoureonu, the north-we&s;t penin&s;ula. After rowing a few miles, we went on &s;hore again, but the only thing we &s;aw worth notice, was a repo&s;itory for the dead, uncommonly decorated: the pavement was ex|tremely neat, and upon it was rai&s;ed a pyramid, about five feet high, which was entirely covered with the fruits of two plants, peculiar to the country. Near the pyramid was a &s;mall image of &s;tone, of very rude workman&s;hip, and the fir&s;t in&s;tance of carving in &s;tone that we had &s;een among the&s;e people. They appeared to &s;et a high value upon it, for it was covered from the weather by a &s;hed, that had been erected on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We proceeded in the boat; and pa&s;&s;ed through the only harbour, on the &s;outh &s;ide of Opoureonu, that is fit for &s;hip|ping. It is &s;ituated about five miles to the we&s;tward of the i&s;thmus, between two &s;mall i&s;lands that lie near the &s;hore, and about a mile di&s;tant from each other, and affords good anchor|age in eleven and twelve fathom water. We were now not far from the di&s;trict called PAPARRA, which belonged to our friends Oamo and Oberea, where we propo&s;ed to &s;leep. We went on &s;hore about an hour before night, and found that they were both ab&s;ent, having left their habitations to pay us a vi|&s;it at Matavai: this, however, did not alter our purpo&s;e, we took up our quarters at the hou&s;e of Oberea, which, though &s;mall, was very neat, and at this time had no inhabitant but her father, who received us with looks that bid us welcome. Having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we were willing to improve the little day-light that was left us, and therefore walked out to a point, upon which we had &s;een, at a di&s;tance, trees that are here called <HI>Etoa,</HI> which generally di&s;tingui&s;h the places where the&s;e people bury the bones of their dead: their name for &s;uch bu|rying-grounds, which are al&s;o places of wor&s;hip, is MORAI, we were &s;oon &s;truck with the &s;ight of an enormous pile, which we were told was the Morai of Oamo and Oberea, and the prin|cipal piece of Indian architecture in the i&s;land. It was a pile of &s;tone work, rai&s;ed pyramidically, upon an oblong ba&s;e, or &s;quare, 276 feet long, and eighty-&s;even wide. It was built like the &s;mall pyramidal mounts upon which we &s;ome|times fix the pillar of a &s;un-dial, where each &s;ide is a flight of &s;teps; the &s;teps, however, at the &s;ides, were broader than tho&s;e at the ends, &s;o that it terminated not in a &s;quare of the &s;ame figure with the ba&s;e, but in a ridge, like the roof of a hou&s;e: there were eleven of the&s;e &s;teps, each of which was
<PB N="105" REF="013324_0132_0F90F0B372E53490">
4 feet high, &s;o that the height of the pile was 44 feet, each &s;tep was formed of one cour&s;e of white coral &s;tone, which was neatly &s;quared and poli&s;hed, the re&s;t of the ma&s;s, for there was no hollow within, con&s;i&s;ted of round pebles, which, from the regularity of their figure, &s;eemed to have been wrought. Some of the coral &s;tones were very large; we mea&s;ured one of them, and found it three feet and an half, by two feet and an half. The foundation was of rock &s;tones, which were al&s;o &s;quared; and one of them mea&s;ured four feet &s;even inches by two feet four. Such a &s;tructure, rai&s;ed without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of iron tools to &s;hape the &s;tones, or mortar to join them, &s;truck us with a&s;toni&s;hment: it &s;eemed to be as compact and firm as it could have been made by any workman in Europe, except that the &s;teps, which range along its greate&s;t length, are not perfectly &s;trait, but &s;ink in a kind of hollow in the middle, &s;o that the whole &s;urface, from end to end, is not a right line, but a curve. The quarry &s;tones, as we &s;aw no quarry in the neighbourhood, mu&s;t have been brought from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and there is no method of conveyance here but by hand: the coral mu&s;t al&s;o have been fi&s;hed from under the wa|ter, where, though it may be found in plenty, it lies at a con|&s;iderable depth, never le&s;s than three feet. Both the rock &s;tone and the coral could be &s;quared only by tools made of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, which mu&s;t have been a work of incredible la|bour; but the poli&s;hing was more ea&s;ily effected by means of the &s;harp coral &s;and, which is found every where upon the &s;ea &s;hore in great abundance. In the middle of the top &s;tood the image of a bird, carved in wood; and near is lay the broken one of a fi&s;h, carved in &s;tone. The whole of this pyramid made part of one &s;ide of a &s;pacious area or &s;quare, nearly of equal &s;ides, being three hundred and &s;ixty feet by three hund|red and fifty-four, which was walled in with &s;tone, and paved with flat &s;tones in its whole extent; though there were growing in it, notwith&s;tanding the pavement, &s;everal of the trees which they call <HI>Etoa,</HI> and plantains. About an hundred yards to the we&s;t of this building, was another paved area or court, in which were &s;everal &s;mall &s;tages rai&s;ed on wooden pillars, about &s;even feet high, which are called by the Indians Ewattas, and &s;eem to be a kind of altars, as upon the&s;e are placed provi&s;ions of all kinds, as offerings to their gods; we have &s;ince &s;een whole hogs placed upon them, and we found here the &s;kulls of above fifty, be&s;ides the &s;kulls of a great num|ber of dogs.</P>
<P>The principal object of ambition among the&s;e people is to have a magnificent Morai, and this was a &s;triking memorial of the rank and power of Oberea. It has been remarked that we did not find her inve&s;ted with the &s;ame authority that &s;he exerci&s;ed when the Dolphin was at this place, and
<PB N="106" REF="013324_0133_0F90F0B43409B378">
we now learnt the rea&s;on of it. Our way from her hou&s;e to the Morai lay along the &s;ea &s;ide, and we ob&s;erved every where under our feet a great number of human bones, chiefly ribs and vertebrae. Upon enquiring into the cau&s;e of &s;o &s;ingular an appearance, we were told, that in the then la&s;t month of <HI>Owarahew,</HI> which an&s;wered to our December, 1768, about four or five months before our arrival, the people of Tiarra|bou, the S. E. penin&s;ula, which we had ju&s;t vi&s;ited, made a de&s;cent at this place, and killed a great number of people, who&s;e bones were tho&s;e that we &s;aw upon the &s;hore: that, upon this occa&s;ion, Oberea, and Oamo, who then admini&s;tered the government for his &s;on, had fled to the mountains; and that the conquerors burnt all the hou&s;es, which were very large, and carried away the hogs and what other animals they found. We learnt al&s;o, that the turkey and goo&s;e, which we had &s;een when we were with Mathiabo, the &s;tealer of cloaks, were among the &s;poils; this accounted for their being found among people with whom the Dolphin had little or no communication; and upon mentioning the jaw-bones, which we had &s;een hanging from a board in a long hou&s;e, we were told, that they al&s;o had been carried away as trophies; the people here carrying away the jaw-bones of their enemies, as the Indians of North Ame|rica do the &s;calps.</P>
<P>After having thus gratified our curio&s;ity, we returned to our quarters, where we pa&s;&s;ed the night in perfect &s;ecurity and quiet. By the next evening we arrived at Atahourou, the re|&s;idence of our friend Tootahah, where, the la&s;t time we pa&s;&s;ed the night under his protection, we had been obliged to leave the be&s;t part of our clothes behind us. This adventure, how|ever, &s;eemed now to be forgotten on both &s;ides. Our friends received us with great plea&s;ure, and gave us a good &s;upper and a good lodging, where we &s;uffered neither lo&s;s or di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>The next day, Saturday, July the 1&s;t, we got back to our fort at Matavai, having found the circuit of the i&s;land, in|cluding both penin&s;ulas, to be about thirty leagues. Upon our complaining of the want of bread-fruit, we were told, that the produce of the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on was nearly exhau&s;ted; and that what was &s;een &s;prouting upon the trees, would not be fit to u&s;e in le&s;s than three months; this accounted for our hav|ing been able to procure &s;o little of it in our route.</P>
<P>While the bread-fruit is ripening upon the flats, the inha|bitants are &s;upplied in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the trees which they have planted upon the hills to pre&s;erve a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but the quantity is not &s;ufficient to prevent &s;carcity: they live there|fore upon the four pa&s;te which they call <HI>Mahie,</HI> upon wild plantains, and ahee-nuts, which at this time are in perfection. How it happened that the Dolphin, which was here at this &s;ea&s;on, found &s;uch plenty of bread-fruit upon the trees, I can|not
<PB N="107" REF="013324_0134_0F904D2B3A91C640">
tell, except the &s;ea&s;on in which they ripen varies.</P>
<P>At our return our Indian friends crouded about us, and none of them came empty-handed. Though I had determined to re&s;tore the canoes which had been detained to their owners, it had not yet been done; but I now relea&s;ed them as they were applied for. Upon this occa&s;ion I could not but remark with concern, that the&s;e people were capable of practi&s;ing petty frauds again&s;t each other, with a deliberate di&s;hone&s;ty, which gave me a much wor&s;e opinion of them than I had ever en|tertained from the robberies they committed under the &s;trong temptation to which a &s;udden opportunity of enriching them|&s;elves with the ine&s;timable metal and manufactures of Europe expo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Among others who appied to me for the relea&s;e of a canoe, was one POTATTOW, a man of &s;ome con&s;equence, well known to us all. I con&s;ented, &s;uppo&s;ing the ve&s;&s;el to be his own, or that he applied on behalf of a friend: he went immediately to the beach, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the boats, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his people, he began to carry off. Upon this, however, it was eagerly claimed by the right owners, who, &s;upported by the other Indians, clamorou&s;ly reproached him for invading their property, and prepared to take the canoe from him by force. Upon this, he de&s;ired to be heard, and told them, that the canoe did, indeed, once belong to tho&s;e who claimed it; but that I, having &s;eized it as a for|feit, had &s;old it to him for a pig. This &s;ilenced the clamour, the owners, knowing that from my power there is no appeal, acquie&s;ced; and Potattow would have carried off his prize, if the di&s;pute had not fortunately been overheard by &s;ome of our people, who reported it to me. I gave orders immediately that the Indians &s;hould be undeceived; upon which the right owners took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their canoe, and Potattow was &s;o con|&s;cious of his guilt, that neither he nor his wife, who was pri|vy to his knavery, could look us in the face for &s;ome time afterwards.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. An Expedition of Mr. Banks to trace the River: Marks of &s;ub|terraneous Fire: Preparations for leaving the I&s;land: An Account of Tupia.</HEAD>
<P>ON the third Mr. Banks &s;et out early in the morning, with &s;ome Indian guides, to trace our river up the valley from which it i&s;&s;ues, and examine how far its banks were in|habited. For about &s;ix miles they met with hou&s;es, not far
<PB N="108" REF="013324_0135_0F90F0A5396C5528">
di&s;tant from each other, on each &s;ide of the river, and the val|ley was every where about four hundred yards wide from the foot of the hill on one &s;ide, to the foot of that on the other; but they were now &s;hewn a hou&s;e which they were told was the la&s;t that they would &s;ee. When they came up to it, the ma&s;|ter of it offered them refre&s;hments of cocoa-nuts and other fruit, of which they accepted; after a &s;hort &s;tay, they walked for|ward for a con&s;iderable time; in bad way it is not ea&s;y to com|pute di&s;tances, but they imagined that they had walked about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> miles farther, following the cour&s;e of the river, when they frequently pa&s;&s;ed under vaults, formed by fragments of the rock, in which they were told people who were benighted fre|quently pa&s;&s;ed the night. Soon after they found the river banked by &s;teep rocks, from which a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, falling with great violence, formed a pool, &s;o &s;teep, that the Indians &s;aid they could not pa&s;s it. They &s;eemed, indeed, not much to be acquainted with the valley beyond this place, their bu&s;ine&s;s bring chiefly upon the declivity of the rocks on each &s;ide, and the plains which extended on their &s;ummits, where they found plenty of a wild plantain, which they called <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> The way up the&s;e rocks from the banks of the river was in every re&s;pect dreadful: the &s;ides were nearly perpendicular, and in &s;ome places one hundred feet high; they were al&s;o rendered exceed|ing &s;lippery by the water of innumerable &s;prings which i&s;&s;ued from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the &s;urface: yet up the&s;e precipices a way was to be traced by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of long pieces of the bark of the <HI>Hibi&s;cus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> which &s;erved as a rope for the climber to take hold of, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in &s;crambling from one ledge to another, though upon the&s;e ledges there was footing only for an Indian or a goat. One of the&s;e ropes was nearly thirty feet in length, and their guides offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in mount|ing this pa&s;s, but recommended another at a little di&s;tance lower down, as le&s;s difficult and dangerous. They took a view of this "better way," but found it &s;o bad that they did not chu&s;e to attempt it, as there was nothing at the top to re|ward their full and hazard but a &s;tore of the wild plantain of Vae tree, which they had often &s;een before.</P>
<P>During this excur&s;ion, Mr. Banks had an excellent opportu|nity to examine the rocks, which were almo&s;t every where naked, for minerals; but he found not the lea&s;t appearance of any. The &s;tones every where, like tho&s;e of Madeira, &s;hewed manife&s;t tokens of having burnt, nor is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> a &s;ingle &s;pecimen of any &s;tone, among all tho&s;e that were collected in the I&s;land, upon which there are not manife&s;t and indubitable marks of fire; except perhaps &s;ome &s;mall pieces of the hatchet &s;tone, and even of that, other fragments were col|lected, which are burnt almo&s;t on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

therefore, not unrea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this, and the neighbouring i&s;lands, are either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remains of a continent which &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary in this part of the globe, to pre&s;erve an equilibrium of its parts, which were left behind when the re&s;t &s;unk by the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fire, &s;o as to give a pa&s;&s;age to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over it; or were turn from rocks, which, from the creation of the world, had been the bed of the &s;ea, and thrown up in heaps, to a height which the waters never reach. One or other of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions will perhaps be thought the more probable, as the water does not gradually gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w &s;hallow as the &s;hore is approached, and the i&s;lands are almo&s;t every where &s;urrounded by reefs, which ap|pear to be rude and broken, as &s;ome violent concu&s;&s;ion would naturally leave the &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance of the earth. It may al&s;o be remarked upon this occa&s;ion, that the mo&s;t probable cau&s;e of earthquakes &s;eems to be the &s;udden ru&s;hing in of water upon &s;ome va&s;t ma&s;s of &s;ubterraneous fire, by the in&s;tantaneous rare|faction of which into vapour, the mine is &s;prung, and various &s;ub&s;tances in all &s;tages of vitrification, with &s;hells and other marine productions, that are now found fo&s;&s;il, and the &s;trata that covered the furnace, are thrown up, while tho&s;e parts of the land which were &s;upported upon the broken &s;hell give way, and flak into the gulph. With this theory the phaenomena of all earthquakes form to agree; pools of water are frequently left where land has &s;ub&s;ided, and various &s;ub&s;tances which mani|fe&s;tly appear to have &s;uffered by the action of fire, are thrown up. It is indeed true, that fire cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without air; but this cannot be urged again&s;t there being fire below that part of the earth which forms the bed of the &s;ea; becau&s;e there may be innumerable fi&s;&s;ures by which a communication between tho&s;e parts and the external air may be kept up, even upon the highe&s;t mountains, and at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the &s;ea|&s;hore.</P>
<P>On the 4th, Mr. Banks employed him&s;elf in planting a great quantity of the &s;eeds of water-melons, oranges, lemons, limes, and other plants and trees which he had collected at Rio de Ja|neiro. For th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e he prepared ground on each &s;ide of the fort, with as many varieties of &s;oil as he could chu&s;e; and there is little doubt but that they will &s;ucceed. He al&s;o gave liberally of the&s;e &s;eeds to the Indians, and planted many of them in the woods; &s;ome of the melon &s;eeds having been planted &s;oon after our arrival, the natives &s;hewed him &s;everal of the plants which appeared to be in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition, and were con|tinually a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing him for more.</P>
<P>We now begin to prepare for our departure, by bending the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and performing other nece&s;&s;ary operations on board the &s;hip, our water being already on board, and the provi&s;ions examined. In the mean time we had another vi&s;it from Omen, Oberea, and
<PB N="110" REF="013324_0137_0F90F0B5B78A9508">
their &s;on and daughter; the Indians expre&s;&s;ing their re&s;pect by uncovering the upper parts of their body as they had done be|fore. The daughter, who&s;e name we under&s;tood to be Toi|mata, was very de&s;irous to &s;ee the fort, but her father would by no means &s;uffer her to come in. Tearee, the &s;on of Waheatua, the &s;overeign of Tiarrabou, the &s;outh ea&s;t penin&s;ula, was al&s;o with us at this time; and we received intelligence of the landing of another gue&s;t, who&s;e company was neither expected nor de&s;ired: this was no other than the ingenious gentleman who contrived to &s;teal our quadrant. We were told, that he intended to try his fortune again in the night; but the Indians all offered very zealou&s;ly to a&s;&s;i&s;t us again&s;t him, de&s;iring that, for this purpo&s;e, they might be permitted to lie in the fort. This had &s;o good an effect, that the thief relinqui&s;hed his enter|prize in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>On the 7th, the carpenters were employed in taking down the gates and palli&s;adoes of our little fortification, for firewood on board the &s;hip; and one of the Indians had dexterity enough to &s;teal the &s;taple and hook upon which the gate turned: he was immediately pur&s;ued, and after a chace of &s;ix miles, he appeared to have been pa&s;&s;ed, having concealed him&s;elf among &s;ome ru&s;hes in the brook; the ru&s;hes were &s;earched, and tho' the thief had e&s;caped, a &s;craper was found which had been &s;tolen from the &s;hip &s;ometime before; and &s;oon after our old friend Tubourai Tamaide brought us the &s;taple.</P>
<P>On the 8th and 9th, we continued to di&s;mantle our fort, and our friends &s;till flocked about us; &s;ome, I believe, &s;orry at the approach of our departure, and others de&s;irous to make as much as they could of us while we &s;taid.</P>
<P>We were in hopes that we &s;hould now leave the i&s;land, with|out giving or receiving any other offence; but it unfortunately happened otherwi&s;e. Two foreign &s;eamen having been out with my permi&s;&s;ion, one of them was robbed of his knife, and endeavouring to recover it, probably with circum&s;tances of great provocation, the Indians attacked him and dangerou&s;ly wounded him with a &s;tone; they wounded his companion al&s;o &s;lightly in the head, and then fled into the mountains. As I &s;hould have been &s;orry to take any farther notice of the affair, I was not di&s;plea&s;ed that the offenders had e&s;caped; but I was immediately involved in a quarrel which I very much regretted, and which yet it was not po&s;&s;ible to avoid.</P>
<P>In the middle of the night between the 8th and 9th, Cle|ment Webb and Samuel Gib&s;on, two of the marines, both young men, went privately from the fort, and in the morning were not to be found. As public notice had been given, that all hands were to go on board on the next day, and that the &s;hip would &s;ail on the morrow of that day or the day following, I began to fear that the ab&s;entees intended to &s;tay behind. I knew
<PB N="111" REF="013324_0138_0F90F0B67297C070">
that I could take no effectual &s;teps to recover them, without endangering the harmony and good will which at pre&s;ent &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted among us; and therefore, determined to wait a day for the chance of their return.</P>
<P>On Monday morning the 10th, the marines, to my great concern, not being returned, an enquiry was made after them of the Indians, who frankly told us that they did not intend to return, and had taken refuge in the mountains, where it was impo&s;&s;ible for our people to find them. They were then re|que&s;ted to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;earch, and after &s;ome deliberation, two of them undertook to conduct &s;uch per&s;ons as I &s;hould think proper to &s;end after them to the place of their retreat. As they were known to be without arms, I thought two would be &s;uf|ficient, and accordingly di&s;patched a petty officer, and the corporal of the marines, with the Indian guides, to fetch them back. As the recovery of the&s;e men was a matter of great im|portance, as I had no time to lo&s;e, and as the Indians &s;poke doubtfully of their return, telling us, that they had each of them taken a wife, and were become inhabitants of the country, it was intimated to &s;everal of the chiefs who were in the fort with their women, among whom were Tubourai Tamaide, Tomio, and Oberea, that they would not be permitted to leave it till our de&s;erters were brought back. This precaution I thought the more nece&s;&s;ary, as by concealing them a few days, they might compel me to go without them; and I had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, that they received the intimation with very little &s;igns either of fear or di&s;content; a&s;&s;uring me that my peo|ple &s;hould be &s;ecured and &s;ent back as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. While this was doing at the fort. I &s;ent Mr. Hicks in the pinnace to fetch Tootahah on board the &s;hip, which he did, without alarming either him or his people. If the Indian guides proved faithful and in earne&s;t, I had rea&s;on to expect the return of my people with the de&s;erters before evening. Being di&s;appointed, my &s;u&s;picions increa&s;ed; and night coming on, I thought it was not &s;afe to let the people whom I had detained as ho&s;tages con|tinue at the fort, and I therefore ordered Tubourai Tamaide, Oberea, and &s;ome others, to be taken on board the &s;hip. This &s;pread a general alarm, and &s;everal of them, e&s;pecially the women, expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ions with great emotion and many tears when they were put into the boat. I went on board with them, and Mr. Banks remained on &s;hore, with &s;ome others whom I thought it of le&s;s con&s;equence to &s;ecure.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock, Webb was brought back by &s;ome of the natives, who declared, that Gib&s;on, and the petty officer and corporal, would be detained till Tootahah &s;hould be &s;et at li|berty. The tables were now turned upon me; but I had pro|ceeded too far to retreat. I immediately di&s;patched Mr. Hicks in the long boat, with a &s;trong party of men, to re&s;cue the pri|&s;oners,
<PB N="112" REF="013324_0139_0F8FF5214314D180">
and told Tootahah that it behoved him to &s;end &s;ome of his people with them, with orders to afford them effectual a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and to demand the relea&s;e of my men in his name, for that I &s;hould expect him to an&s;wer for the contrary. He readily complied; this party recovered my men without the lea&s;t op|po&s;ition; and about &s;even o'clock in the morning, returned with them to the &s;hip, though they had not been able to recover the arms which had been taken from them when they were &s;eized; the&s;e however, were brought on board in le&s;s than half an hour, and the chiefs were immediately &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>When I que&s;tioned the petty officer concerning what had happened on &s;hore, he told me, that neither the natives who went with him, nor tho&s;e whom they met in their way, would give them any intelligence of the de&s;erters; but on the con|trary, became very trouble&s;ome: that, as he was returning for further orders to the &s;hip, he and his comrade were &s;uddenly &s;eized, by a number of armed men, who having learnt that Tootahah was confined, had concealed them&s;elves in a wood for that purpo&s;e, and who having taken them at a di&s;advantage, forced their weapons out of their hands, and declared, that they would detain them till their chief &s;hould be &s;et at liberty. He &s;aid, however, that the Indians were not unanimous in this mea&s;ure; that &s;ome were for &s;etting them at liberty, and others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 line"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> them: that an eager di&s;pute en&s;ued, and that from words they came to blows, but that the party for detain|ing them at length prevailed: that &s;oon after Webb and Gib|&s;on were brought in by a party of the natives, as pri&s;oners, that they al&s;o might be &s;ecured as ho&s;tages for the chief; but that it was after &s;ome debate re&s;olved to &s;end Webb to inform me of their re&s;olution, to a&s;&s;ure me that his companions were &s;afe, and direct me where I might &s;end my an&s;wer. Thus it appears that whatever were the di&s;advantages of &s;eizing the chiefs, I &s;hould never have recovered my men by any other method. When the chiefs were &s;et on &s;hore from the &s;hip, tho&s;e at the fort were al&s;o &s;et at liberty, and, after &s;taying with Mr. Banks about an hour, they all went away. Upon this occa&s;ion, as they had done upon another of the &s;ame kind, they expre&s;&s;ed their joy by an unde&s;erved liberality, &s;trongly urging us to accept of four hogs. The&s;e we ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed as a pre|&s;ent, and they as ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing to be paid for them, the hogs did not change ma&s;ters. Upon examining the de&s;erters, we found that the account which the Indians had given of them was true: they had &s;trongly attached them&s;elves to two girls, and it was their intention to conceal them&s;elves till the &s;hip had &s;ailed, and take up their re&s;idence upon the i&s;land. This night every thing was got off from the &s;hore, and every body &s;lept on board.</P>
<P>Among the natives who were almo&s;t con&s;tantly with us,
<PB N="113" REF="013324_0140_0F90F0B73926F370">
was Tupia, who&s;e name has been often mentioned in this nar|rative. He had been, as I have before ob&s;erved, the fir&s;t mi|ni&s;ter of Oberea, when &s;he was in the height of her power: he was al&s;o the chief Tahowa or prie&s;t of the i&s;land, con&s;equently well acquainted with the religion of the country, as well with re&s;pect to its ceremonies as principles. He had al&s;o great ex|perience and knowledge in navigation, and was particularly acquainted with the number and &s;ituation of the neigbouring i&s;lands. This man had often expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to go with us, and on the 12th in the morning, having with the other natives left us the day before, he came on board, with a boy about thirteen years of age, his &s;ervant, and urged us to let him pro|ceed with us on our voyage. To have &s;uch a per&s;on on board was certainly de&s;irable for many rea&s;ons; by learning his lan|guage, and teaching him ours, we &s;hould be able to acquire a much better knowledge of the cu&s;toms, policy, and religion of the people, than our &s;hort &s;tay among them could give us, I therefore gladly agreed to receive them on board. As we were prevented from &s;ailing to day, by having found it nece&s;&s;ary to make new &s;tocks to our &s;mall and be&s;t bower anchors, the old ones having been totally de&s;troyed by the worms, Tupia &s;aid, he would go once more on &s;hore, and make a &s;ignal for the boat to fetch him off in the evening. He went accordingly, and took with him a miniature picture of Mr. Banks's, to &s;hew his friends, and &s;everal little things to give them as parting pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>After dinner, Mr. Banks being de&s;irous to procure a drawing of the Morai belonging to Tootahah at Eparre, I attended him thither, accompanied by Dr. Solander, in the pinnace. As &s;oon as we landed, many of our friends came to meet us, though &s;ome ab&s;ented them&s;elves in re&s;entment of what had happened the day before. We immediately proceeded to Too|tahah's hou&s;e, where we were joined by Oberea, with &s;everal others who had not come out to meet us, and a perfect recon|ciliation was &s;oon brought about; in con&s;equence of which they promi&s;ed to vi&s;it us early the next day, to take a la&s;t fare|well of us, as we told them we &s;hould certainly &s;et &s;ail in the afternoon. At this place al&s;o we found Tupia, who returned with us, and &s;lept this night on board the &s;hip for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>On the next morning, Thur&s;day the 13th of July, the &s;hip was very early crouded with our friends, and &s;urrounded by a multitude of canoes, which were filled with the natives of an inferior cla&s;s. Between eleven and twelve we weighed anchor, and as &s;oon as the &s;hip was under &s;ail, the Indians on board took their leaves, and wept, with a decent and &s;ilent &s;orrow, in which there was &s;omething very &s;triking and tender: the people in the canoes, on the contrary, &s;eemed to vie with each
<PB N="114" REF="013324_0141_0F90F0B7F4DD3FB8">
other in the loudne&s;s of their lamentations, which we con&s;idered rather as affectation than grief. Tupia &s;u&s;tained him&s;elf in this &s;cene with a firmne&s;s and re&s;olution truly admirable; he wept indeed, but the effort that he made to conceal his tears, concurred with them, to do him honour. He &s;ent his la&s;t pre|&s;ent, a &s;hirt, by Otheothea, to Potomai, Tootaha's favourite mi&s;tre&s;s, and then went with Mr. Banks to the ma&s;t-head, waving to the canoes as long as they continued in &s;ight.</P>
<P>Thus we took leave of Otaheite, and its inhabitants, after a &s;tay of ju&s;t three months; for much the greater part of the time we lived together in the mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip, and a perpetual reciprocation of good offices. The accidental dif|ferences which now and then happened, could not be more &s;incerely regretted on their part than they were on ours; the principal cau&s;es were &s;uch as nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulted from our &s;itua|tion and circum&s;tances, in conjunction with the infirmities of human nature, from our not being able perfectly to under&s;tand each other, and from the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants to theft, which we could not at all times bear with or prevent. They had not, however, except in one in&s;tance, been attended with any fatal con&s;equence; and to that accident were owing the mea&s;ures that I took to prevent others of the &s;ame kind, I hoped, indeed, to have availed my&s;elf of the impre&s;&s;ion which had been made upon them by the lives that had been &s;acrificed in their conte&s;t with the Dolphin, &s;o as that the intercour&s;e be|tween us &s;hould have been carried on wholly without blood|&s;hed; and by this hope all my mea&s;ures were directed during the whole of my continuance at the i&s;land, and I &s;incerely wi&s;h, that whoever &s;hall next vi&s;it it, may be &s;till more fortunate. Our traffick here was carried on with as much order as in the be&s;t regulated market in Europe. It was managed principally by Mr. Banks, who was indefatigable in procuring provi&s;ion and refre&s;hments while they were to be had; but during the latter part of our time they became &s;carce, partly by the in|crea&s;ed con&s;umption at the fort and &s;hip, and partly by the coming on of the &s;ea&s;on in which cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit fail All kind of fruit, we purcha&s;ed for beads and nails, but no nails le&s;s than fortypenny were current: after a very &s;hort time we could never get a pig of more than ten or twelve pounds, for le&s;s than a hatchet; becau&s;e, though the&s;e people &s;et a high value upon &s;pike nails, vet the&s;e being an article with which many of the people in the &s;hip were provided, the women found a much more ea&s;y way of procuring them than by bringing down provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The be&s;t articles for traffick here are axes, hatchets, &s;pikes, large nails, looking-gla&s;&s;es, knives, and beads, for &s;ome of which, every thing that the natives have may be procured. They are indeed fond of fine linen cloth, both white and
<PB N="115" REF="013324_0142_0F90F0B8B6F75D88">
printed; but an ax worth half a crown, will fetch more than a piece of cloth worth twenty &s;hillings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. A particular De&s;cription of the I&s;land; its Produce and Inhabi|tants; their Dre&s;s, Habitations, Food, Dome&s;tic Life and Amu&s;ements.</HEAD>
<P>WE found the longitude of Port-Royal bay, in this i&s;land, as &s;ettled by Captain Wallis, who di&s;covered it on the 9th of June 1767, to be within half a degree of the truth. We found Point Venus, the northern extremity of the i&s;land, and the ea&s;tern point of the bay, to lie in the longitude of 149&deg; 30&prime; this being the mean re&s;ult of a great number of ob&s;erva|tions made upon the &s;pot. The i&s;land is &s;urrounded by a reef of coral rock, which forms &s;everal excellent bays and harbours, &s;ome of which have been particularly de&s;cribed, where there is room and depth of water for any number of the large&s;t &s;hips. Port-Royal bay, called by the natives Matavai, which is not inferior to any in Otaheite, may ea&s;ily be known by a very high mountain in the middle of the i&s;land, which bears due South from Point Venus. To &s;ail into it, either keep the we&s;t point of the reef that lies before Point Venus, clo&s;e on board, or give it a birth of near half a mile, in order to avoid a &s;mall &s;hoal of coral rocks on which there is but two fathom and an half of water. The be&s;t anchoring is on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the bay, where there is &s;ixteen and fourteen fathom upon an ou&s;ey bottom. The &s;hore of the bay is a fine &s;andy beach, behind which runs a river of fre&s;h water, &s;o that any number of &s;hips may water here without incommoding each other; but the only wood for firing, upon the whole i&s;land, is that of fruit trees, which mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed of the natives, or all hopes of living upon good terms with them given up. There are &s;ome harbours to the we&s;tward of this bay which have not been men|tioned, but as they are contiguous to it, a de&s;cription of them is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The face of the country, except that part of it which bor|ders upon the &s;ea, is very uneven; it ri&s;es in ridges that run up into the middle of the i&s;land, and there form mountains, which may be &s;een at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty miles: between the foot of the&s;e ridges and the &s;ea, is a border of low land, &s;ur|rounding the whole i&s;land, except in a few places, where the ridges ri&s;e directly from the &s;ea; the border of low land is in different parts of different breadths, but no where more than a mile and a half. The &s;oil, except upon the very tops of the
<PB N="116" REF="013324_0143_0F8FF52207FC5790">
ridges, is extremely rich and fertile, watered by a great number of rivulets of excellent water, and covered with fruit trees of various kinds, &s;ome of which are of a &s;tately growth and thick foliage, &s;o as to form one continued wood; and even the tops of the ridges, though in general they are bare, and burnt up by the &s;un, are, in &s;ome parts, not without their produce.</P>
<P>The low land that lies between the foot of the ridges and the &s;ea, and &s;ome of the vallies, are the only parts of the i&s;land that are inhabited, and here it is populous; the hou&s;es do not form villages or towns, but are ranged along the whole border at the di&s;tance of about fifty yards from each other, with little plantations of plantains, the tree which fur|ni&s;hes them with cloth. The whole i&s;land, according to Tupia's account, who certainly knew, could furni&s;h &s;ix thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty fighting men, from which the number of inhabitants may ea&s;ily be computed.</P>
<P>The produce of this i&s;land is bread fruit, cocoa-nuts, bana|nas, of thirteen &s;orts, the be&s;t we had ever eaten; plantains; a fruit not unlike an apple, which, when ripe, is very plea|&s;ant; &s;weet potatoes, yams, cocoas, a kind of <HI>arum;</HI> a fruit known by the name of <HI>jambu,</HI> and reckoned mo&s;t delicious; &s;ugar cane, which the inhabitants eat raw; a root of the &s;alop kind, called by the inhabitants <HI>pea;</HI> a plant called <HI>ethee,</HI> of which the root only is eaten; a fruit that grows in a pod, like that of a large kidney bean, which, when it is roa&s;ted, eats very much like a che&s;nut, by the natives called <HI>ahee;</HI> a tree called <HI>wharra,</HI> called in the Ea&s;t-Indies <HI>pandares,</HI> which pro|duces fruit, &s;omething like the pine-apple; a &s;hrub called <HI>nono;</HI> the <HI>marinda,</HI> which al&s;o produces fruit; a &s;pecies of fern, of which the root is eaten, and &s;ometimes the leaves; and a a plant called <HI>theve,</HI> of which the root al&s;o is eaten: but the fruits of the <HI>nono,</HI> the fern and the <HI>theve,</HI> are eaten only by the inferior people, and in times of &s;carcity. All the&s;e, which &s;erve the inhabitants for food, the earth produces &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or with &s;o little culture, that they &s;eem to be exempted from the fir&s;t general cur&s;e, that "man &s;hould eat his bread in the &s;weat of his brow." They have al&s;o the Chine&s;e paper mul|berry, <HI>morus papyrifera,</HI> which they call <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uta;</HI> a tree re&s;em|bling the wild fig tree of the We&s;t-Indies; another &s;pecies of fig, which they call <HI>matte;</HI> the <HI>cordia &s;ebe&s;tina orientalis,</HI> which they call <HI>etou;</HI> a kind of cyprus gra&s;s, which they call <HI>moo;</HI> a &s;pecies of <HI>tournefortia,</HI> which they call <HI>taheinoo;</HI> another of the <HI>convolvulus poluce,</HI> which they call <HI>eurhe;</HI> the <HI>&s;olanum centifolium,</HI> which they call <HI>ebooa;</HI> the <HI>calophyllum mophylum,</HI> which they call <HI>tamannu;</HI> the <HI>hibi&s;cus tiliaceus,</HI> called <HI>poerou,</HI> a frute&s;cent nettle; the <HI>urtica argentea,</HI> called <HI>erowa;</HI> with many other plants which cannot here be particularly mentioned: tho&s;e that have been named already, will be referred to in the &s;ub&s;equent part of this work.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="013324_0144_0F8FF52296A2F7B8">
They have no European fruit, garden &s;tuff, pul&s;e, or legu|mes, nor grain of any kind.</P>
<P>Of tame animals they have only hogs, dogs, and poultry; neither is there a wild animal in the i&s;land, except ducks, pigeons, paroquets, with a few other birds, and rats, there being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> other quadruped, nor any &s;erpent. But the &s;ea &s;up|plies them with great variety of mo&s;t excellent fi&s;h, to eat which is their chief luxury, and to catch it their principal labour.</P>
<P>As to the people they are of the large&s;t &s;ize of Europeans. The men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tail, &s;trong, well-limbed, and finely &s;haped. The talle&s;t that we &s;aw was a man upon a neighbouring i&s;land, called Huaheine, who mea&s;ured &s;ix feet three inches and an half. The women of the &s;uperior rank are al&s;o in general above our middle &s;tature, but tho&s;e of the inferior cla&s;s are ra|ther below it, and &s;ome of them are very &s;mall. This defect in &s;ize probably proceeds from their early commerce with men, the only thing in which they differ from their &s;uperiors, that could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> affect their growth.</P>
<P>Their natural complexion is that kind of clear olive, or brunette, which many people in Europe prefer to the fine&s;t white and red. In tho&s;e that are expo&s;ed to the wind and &s;un, it is con&s;iderably deepened, but in others that live under &s;hel|ter, e&s;pecially the &s;uperior cla&s;s of women, it continues of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 line"> native <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ue, and the &s;kin is mo&s;t delicately &s;mooth and &s;oft; they have no tint in their cheeks, which we di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of colour. The &s;hape of the face is comely, the cheek bones are not high, neither are the eyes hollow, nor the brow prominent: the only feature that does not corre&s;pond with our ideas of beauty is the no&s;e, which, in general, is &s;omewhat flat; but their eyes, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the women, are full of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;ometimes &s;parkling with fire, and &s;ometimes melt|ing with &s;oftne&s;s; their teeth al&s;o are, almo&s;t without excep|tion, mo&s;t beautifully even and white, and their breath per|fectly without taint.</P>
<P>The hair is almo&s;t univer&s;ally black, and rather coar&s;e; the men have beards which they wear in many fa&s;hions, always, however, plucking out great part of them, and keeping the re&s;t perfectly clean and neat. Both &s;exes al&s;o eradicate every hair from under their arms, and accu&s;ed us of great uncleanli|ne&s;s for not doing the &s;ame. In their motions there is at once vigour and ea&s;e; their walk is graceful, their deportment li|beral, and their behaviour to &s;trangers and to each other affable and courteous. In their di&s;po&s;itions al&s;o, they &s;eemed to be brave, open, and candid, without either &s;u&s;picion or treachery, cruelty or revenge; &s;o that we placed the &s;ame confidence in them as in our be&s;t friends, many of us, particularly Mr. Banks, &s;leeping frequently in their hou&s;es in the woods, without a companion, and con&s;equently wholly in their power. They
<PB N="118" REF="013324_0145_0F90F0B976613808">
were however all thieves; and when that is allowed, they need not much fear a competition with the people of any other nation upon earth. During our &s;tay in this i&s;land we &s;aw about five or &s;ix per&s;ons, like one that was met by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander on the 24th of April, in their walk to the ea&s;tward, who&s;e &s;kins were of a dead white, like the no&s;e of a white hor&s;e; with white hair, beard, brows and eye-la&s;hes, red, tender eyes; a &s;hort &s;ight, and &s;curfy &s;kins, covered with a kind of white down; but we found that no two of the&s;e be|longed to the &s;ame family, and therefore concluded, that they were not a &s;pecies, but unhappy individuals, rendered anoma|lous by di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is a cu&s;tom in mo&s;t countries where the inhabitants have long hair, for the men to cut it &s;hort and the women to pride them&s;elves in its length. Here, however, the contrary cu&s;tom prevails; the women always cut it &s;hort round their ears, and the men, except the fi&s;hers, who are almo&s;t continually in the water, &s;uffer it to &s;low in large waves over their &s;houlders, or tie it up in a bunch on the top of their heads.</P>
<P>They have a cu&s;tom al&s;o of anointing their heads, with what they call <HI>monoe,</HI> an oil expre&s;&s;ed from the cocoa-nut, in which &s;ome &s;weet herbs or flowers have been infu&s;ed: as the oil is generally rancid, the &s;mell is at fir&s;t very di&s;agreeable to a European; and as they live in a hot country, and have no &s;uch thing as a comb, they are not able to keep their heads free from lice, which the children and common people &s;ome|times pick out and eat: a hateful cu&s;tom: wholly different from their manners in every other particular; for they are de|licate and cleanly almo&s;t without example, and tho&s;e to whom we di&s;tributed combs, &s;oon delivered them&s;elves from vermin, with a diligence which &s;hewed that they were not m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re odious to us than to them.</P>
<P>They have a cu&s;tom of &s;taining their bodies, nearly in the &s;ame manner as is practi&s;ed in many other parts of the world, which they call <HI>tattowing.</HI> They prick the &s;kin, &s;o as ju&s;t not to fetch blood, with a &s;mall in&s;trument, &s;omething in the form of a hoe; that part which an&s;wers to the blade is made of bone or &s;hell, &s;craped very thin, and is from a quarter of an inch to an inch and a half wide; the edge is cut into &s;harp teeth or points, from the number of three to twenty, according to its &s;ize: when this is to be u&s;ed, they dip the teeth into a mix|ture of a kind of lamp-black, formed of the &s;moke that ri&s;es from an oily nut which they burn in&s;tead of candles, and water; the teeth, thus prepared, are placed upon the &s;kin, and the handle to which they are fa&s;tened being &s;truck, by quick &s;mart blows, with a &s;tick fitted to the purpo&s;e, they pierce it, and at the &s;ame time carry into the puncture the black compo&s;ition, which leaves an indelible &s;tain. The operation is painful,
<PB N="119" REF="013324_0146_0F90F0BA32F1F248">
it is &s;ome days before the wounds are healed. It is performed upon the youth of both &s;exes when they are about twelve or fourteen years of age, on &s;everal parts of the body, and in va|rious figures, according to the fancy of the parent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> perhaps the rank of the party. The women are generally marked with this &s;tain, in the form of a Z, on every joint of their fingers and toes, and frequently round the out&s;ide of their feet; the men are al&s;o marked with the &s;ame figure, and both men and women have &s;quares, circles, cre&s;cents, and ill-de&s;igned repre&s;entations of men, birds, or dogs, and various other devi&s;es impre&s;&s;ed upon their leg and arms, &s;ome of which we were told had &s;ig|nifications, though we could never learn what they were. But the part on which the&s;e ornaments are lavi&s;hed with the greate&s;t profu&s;ion, is the breech: this, in both &s;exes, is covered with a deep black; above which, arches are drawn one over another as high as the &s;hort ribs. They are often a quarter of an inch broad, and the edges are not &s;trait lines, but indented. The&s;e arches are their pride, and are &s;hewn both by men and women with a mixture of o&s;tentation and plea&s;ure; whether as an or|nament, or a proof of their fortitude and re&s;olution in bearing pain, we could not determine. The face in general is left un|marked; for we &s;aw but one in&s;tance to the contrary. Some old men had the greate&s;t part of their bodies covered with large patches of black, deeply indented at the edges, like a rude imitation of flame; but we were told, that they came from a low i&s;land called Noouoora, and were not natives of Otaheite.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks &s;aw the operation of <HI>tattowing</HI> performed upon the back&s;ide of a girl about thirteen years old. The in&s;trument u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion had thirty teeth, and every &s;troke, of which at lea&s;t an hundred were made in a minute, drew an ichor or &s;erum a little tinged with blood. The girl bore it with mo&s;t &s;toical re&s;olution for about a quarter of an hour; but the pain of &s;o many hundred punctures as &s;he had received in that time became intollerable: &s;he fir&s;t complained in mur|murs, then wept, and at la&s;t bur&s;t into loud lamentations, ear|ne&s;tly imploring the operator to de&s;i&s;t. He was, however, in|exorable; and when &s;he began to &s;truggle, &s;he was held down by two women, who &s;ometimes &s;oothed and &s;ometimes chid her, and now and then, when &s;he was mo&s;t unruly, gave her a &s;mart blow. Mr. Banks &s;taid in a neighbouring hou&s;e an hour, and the operation was not over when he went away; yet it was performed but on one &s;ide, the other having been done &s;ometime before; and the arches upon the loins, in which they mo&s;t pride them&s;elves, and which give more pain than all the re&s;t, were &s;till to be done.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange that the&s;e people &s;hould value them&s;elves upon what is no di&s;tinction; for I never &s;aw a native of this i&s;land,
<PB N="120" REF="013324_0147_0F90F0BB1BA6EB20">
man or woman, in a &s;tate of maturity, in whom the&s;e marks were wanting: po&s;&s;ibly they may have their ri&s;e in &s;uper&s;tition, e&s;pecially as they produce no vi&s;ible advantage, and are not made without great pain; but though we enquired of many hundreds, we could never get an account of the matter.</P>
<P>Their clothing con&s;i&s;ts of cloth or matting of different kinds, which will be de&s;cribed among their other manufac|tures. The cloth, which will not bear wetting, they wear in dry weather, and the matting when it rains; they are put on in different ways, ju&s;t as their fancy leads them; for in their garments nothing is cut into &s;hape, nor are any two pieces &s;ewed together. The dre&s;s of the better &s;ort of women con&s;i&s;ts of three or four pieces; one piece, about two yards wide and eleven yards long, they wrap &s;everal times round their wai&s;t, &s;o as to hang down like a petticoat as low as the middle of the leg, and this they call <HI>parou;</HI> two or three other pieces, about two yards and an half long and one wide, each having a hole cut in the middle, they place one upon another, and then putting the head through the holes, they bring the long ends down before and behind; the others remain open at the &s;ides, and give liberty to the arms; this, which they call the <HI>tebuta,</HI> is gathered round the wai&s;t, and confined with a girdle of &s;a&s;h of thinner cloth, which is long enough to go many times round them, and exactly re&s;embles the garment worn by the inhabitants of Peru and Chili, which the Spaniards call <HI>poncho.</HI> The dre&s;s of the men is the &s;ame, except that in&s;tead of &s;uf|fering the cloth that is wound about the hips to hang down like a petticoat, they bring it between their legs &s;o as to have &s;ome re&s;emblance to breeches, and it is then called <HI>maro.</HI> This is the dre&s;s of all ranks of people, and being univer&s;ally the &s;ame as to form, the gentlemen and ladies di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the lower people by the quantity; &s;ome of them will wrap round them &s;everal pieces of cloth, eight or ten yards long, and two or three broad; and &s;ome throw a large piece loo&s;ely over their &s;houlders in the manner of a cloak, or perhaps two pieces, if they are very great per&s;onages, and are de&s;irous to appear in &s;tate. The inferior &s;ort, who have only a &s;mall allowance of cloth from the tribes or families to which they belong, are obliged to be more thinly clad. In the heat of the day they appear almo&s;t naked, the women having only a &s;canty petticoat, and the men nothing but the &s;a&s;h that is pa&s;&s;ed between their legs and fa&s;tened round the wai&s;t. As finery is always trouble&s;ome, and particularly in a hot country, where it con&s;i&s;ts in putting one covering upon another, the women of rank always uncover them&s;elves as low as the wai&s;t in the evening, throwing off all that they wear on the upper part of the body, with the &s;ame negligence and ea&s;e as our lay by a cardinal or double handkerchief. And the chiefs,
<PB N="121" REF="013324_0148_0F8FF5233B37CE28">
even when they vi&s;ited us, though they had as much cloth round their middle as would clothe a dozen people, had fre|quently the re&s;t of the body quite naked.</P>
<P>Upon their legs and feet they wear no covering; but they &s;hade their faces from the &s;un with little bonnets, either of matting or cocoa-nut leaves, which they make occa&s;ionally in a few minutes. This, however, is not all their head dre&s;s; the women &s;ometimes wear little turbans, and &s;ometimes a dre&s;s which they value much mere, and which, indeed, is much more becoming, called <HI>Tomou;</HI> the <HI>Tomou</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of hu|man hair, plaited in threads, &s;carcely thicker than &s;ewing &s;ilk. Mr. Banks has pieces of it above a mile in length, with|out a knot. The&s;e they wind round the head in &s;uch a man|ner as produces a very pretty effect, and in a very great quan|tity; for I have &s;een five or &s;ix &s;uch pieces wound about the head of one woman: among the&s;e threads they &s;tick flowers of various kinds, particularly the cape-je&s;&s;amine, of which they have great plenty, as it is always planted near their hou&s;es. The men &s;ometimes &s;tick the tail feather of the Tropic-bird upright i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their hair, which, as I have ob&s;erved before, is often tied in a bunch upon the top of their heads: &s;ometimes they wear a kind of whim&s;ical garland, made of flowers of va|rious kinds, &s;tuck into a piece of the rind of a plantain; or of &s;carlet peas, &s;tuck with gum upon a piece of wood: and &s;ome|times they wear a kind of wig, made of the hair of men or dogs, or perhaps of cocoa-nut &s;trings, woven upon one thread, which is tied under their hair, &s;o that the&s;e artificial honours of their head may hang down behind. Their per&s;onal orna|ments, be&s;ides flowers, are few; both &s;exes wear ear-rings, but they are placed only on one &s;ide: when we came they con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;mall pieces of &s;hell, &s;tone, berries, red peas, or &s;ome &s;mall pearls, three in a &s;tring; but our beads very &s;oon &s;up|planted them all.</P>
<P>The children go quite naked; the girls till they are three or four years old, and the boys till they are &s;ix or &s;even.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es, or rather dwellings of the&s;e people have been occa&s;ionally mentioned before: they are all built in the wood, between the &s;ea and the mountains, and no more ground is cleared for each hou&s;e, than ju&s;t &s;ufficient to prevent the drop|ping of the branches from rotting the thatch with which they are covered; from the hou&s;e, therefore, the inhabitant &s;teps immediately under the &s;hade, which is the mo&s;t delightful that can be imagined. It con&s;i&s;ts of groves of bread-fruit and co|coa-nuts, without underwood, which are inter&s;ected, in all directions, by the paths that lead from one hou&s;e to the other. Nothing can be more grateful than this &s;hade in &s;o warm a climate, nor any thing more beautiful than the&s;e walks. As there is no underwood, the &s;hade cools without impeding the
<PB N="122" REF="013324_0149_0F8FF524009C5388">
air; and the hou&s;es, having no walls, receive the gale from whatever point it blows. I &s;hall now give a particular de|&s;cription of a hou&s;e of a middling &s;ize, from which, as the &s;tructure is univer&s;ally the &s;ame, a perfect idea may be formed both of tho&s;e that are bigger, and tho&s;e that are le&s;s.</P>
<P>The ground which it covers is an oblong &s;quare, four and twenty feet long, and eleven wide; over this a roof is rai&s;ed, upon three rows of pillars or po&s;ts, parallel to each other, one on each &s;ide, and the other in the middle. This roof con|&s;i&s;ts of two flats &s;ides, inclining to each other, and terminat|ing in a ridge, exactly like the roofs of our thatched hou&s;es in England. The utmo&s;t height within is about nine feet, and the eves on each &s;ide reach to within about three feet and an half of the ground: below this, and through the whole height at each end, it is open, no part of it being inclo&s;ed with a wall. The roof is thatched with palm-leaves, and the floor is covered, &s;ome inches deep with &s;oft hay; over this are laid mats, &s;o that the whole is one cu&s;hion, upon which they &s;it in the day, and &s;leep in the night. In &s;ome hou&s;es, however, there is one &s;tool, which is wholly appropriated to the ma&s;ter of the family; be&s;ides this, they have no furniture, except a few little blocks of wood, the upper &s;ide of which is hollowed into a curve, and which &s;erves them for pillows.</P>
<P>Ths hou&s;e is indeed principally u&s;ed as a dormitory; for, except it rains, they eat in the open air, under the &s;hade of the next tree. The clothes that they wear in the day, &s;erve them for covering in the night: the floor is the common bed of the whole hou&s;ehold, and is not divided by any partition. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e and his wife &s;leep in the middle, next to them the married people, next to them the unmarried wo|men, and next to them at a little di&s;tance, the unmarried men; the &s;ervants, or <HI>Toutous,</HI> as they are called, &s;leep in the open air, except it rains, and in that ca&s;e they come ju&s;t within the &s;hed.</P>
<P>There are, however hou&s;es of another kind, belonging to the Chiefs, in which there is &s;ome degree of privacy. The&s;e are much &s;maller, and &s;o con&s;tructed as to be carried about in their canoes from place to place, and &s;et up occa&s;ionally, like a tent; they are inclo&s;ed on the &s;ides with cocoa-nut leaves, but not &s;o clo&s;e as to exclude the air, and the Chief and his wife &s;leep in them alone.</P>
<P>There are hou&s;es al&s;o of a much larger &s;ize, not built either for the accommodation of a &s;ingle Chief, or a &s;ingle family; but as common receptacles for all the people of a di&s;trict. Some of them are two hundred feet long, thirty broad, and, under the ridge, twenty feet high; the&s;e are built and main|tained at the common expence of the di&s;trict, for the accom|modation
<PB N="123" REF="013324_0150_0F904D2C59B859C0">
of which they are intended; and have on one &s;ide of them a large area, inclo&s;ed with low palli&s;adoes.</P>
<P>The&s;e hou&s;es, like tho&s;e of &s;eparate families, have no walls. Privacy indeed is little wanted among people who have not even the idea of indecency, and who gratify every appetite and pa&s;&s;ion before witne&s;&s;es, with no more &s;en&s;e of impro|priety than we feel when we &s;atisfy our hunger at a &s;ocial board with our family or friends. Tho&s;e who have no idea of indecency with re&s;pect to actions, can have none with re|&s;pect to words; it is, therefore, &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that, in the conver&s;ation of the&s;e people, that which is the prin|cipal &s;ource of their plea&s;ure, is always the principal topic; and that every thing is mentioned without any re&s;traint or emotion, and in the mo&s;t direct terms, by both &s;exes.</P>
<P>Of the food eaten here the greater part is vegetable. Here are no tame animals except hogs, dogs, and poultry, as I have ob&s;erved before, and the&s;e are by no means plenty. When a Chief kills a hog, it is almo&s;t equally divided among his de|pendants; and as they are very numerous, the &s;hare of each individual at the&s;e fea&s;ts, which are not frequent mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be &s;mall. Dogs and fowls fall &s;omewhat more frequent|ly to the &s;hare of the common people. I cannot much com|mend the flavour of their fowls; but we all agreed, that a South Sea dog was little inferior to an Engli&s;h lamb; their excellence is probably owing to their being kept up, and fed wholly upon vegetables. The &s;ea affords them a great varie|ty of fi&s;h. The &s;maller fi&s;h, when they catch any, are gene|rally eaten raw, as we eat oy&s;ters; and nothing that the &s;ea produces comes ami&s;s to them: they are fond of lob&s;ters, crabs, and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, which are found upon the coa&s;t; and they will eat not only &s;ea-in&s;ects, but what &s;eamen call <HI>Blubbers,</HI> though &s;ome of them are &s;o tough, that they are obliged to &s;uffer them to become putrid before they can be chewed. Of the many vegetables that have been mentioned already as &s;erving them for food, the principal is the bread-fruit, to procure which co&s;ts them no trouble or labour, bus climbing a tree: the tree which produces it, does not indeed &s;hoot up &s;pontaneou&s;ly; but if a man plants ten of them in his life-time, which he may do in about an hour, he will as com|pleatly fulfill his duty to his own and future generations, as the native of our le&s;s temperate climate can do by ploughing in the cold winter, and reaping in the &s;ummer's heat, as often as the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons return; even if, after he has procured bread for his pre&s;ent hou&s;hold, he &s;hould convert a &s;urplus into mo|ney, and lay it up for his children.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, that the bread-fruit is not always in &s;ea|&s;on;
<PB N="124" REF="013324_0151_0F8FF525289F2B80">
but cocoa-nuts, bananas, plantains, and a great variety of other fruits, &s;upply the deficiency.</P>
<P>It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, that cookery is but little &s;tudied by the&s;e people as an art; and, indeed, they have but two ways of applying fire to dre&s;s their food, broiling and bak|ing; the operation of broiling is &s;o &s;imple that it requires no de&s;cription, and their baking has been de&s;cribed already, in the the account of an entertainment prepared for us by Tu|pia. Hogs, and lage fi&s;h, are extremely well dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner; and, in our opinion, were more juicy, and more equally done, than by any art of cookery now practi&s;ed in Europe. Bread-fruit is al&s;o cooked in an oven of the &s;ame kind, which renders it &s;oft, and &s;omething like a boiled po|tatoe; not quite &s;o farinaceous as a good one, but more &s;o than tho&s;e of the middling &s;ort.</P>
<P>Of the bread-fruit they al&s;o make three di&s;hes, by putting either water or the milk of the cocoa-nut to it, then beating it to a pa&s;te with a &s;tone pe&s;tle, and afterwards mixing it with ripe plantains, bananas, or the four pa&s;te which they call <HI>Mahie.</HI></P>
<P>The mahie, which has been mentioned as a &s;uccedaneum for ripe bread-fruit, before the &s;ea&s;on for gathering a fre&s;h crop comes on, is thus made:</P>
<P>The fruit is gathered ju&s;t before it is perfectly ripe, and being laid in heaps, is clo&s;ely covered with leaves; in this &s;tate it undergoes a fermentation, and becomes di&s;agreeably &s;weet: the core is then taken out entire, which is done by gently pulling the &s;talk, and the re&s;t of the fruit is thrown in|to a hole, which is dug for that purpo&s;e, generally in the hou&s;es, and neatly lined in the bottom and &s;ides with gra&s;s; the whole is then covered with leaves, and heavy &s;tones laid upon them: in this &s;tate it undergoes a &s;econd fermentation, and becomes four, after which it will &s;uffer no change for ma|ny months: it is taken out of the hole as it is wanted for u&s;e, and being made into balls, it is wrapped up in leaves and baked; after it is dre&s;&s;ed, it will keep five or &s;ix weeks. It is eaten both cold and hot, and the natives &s;eldom make a meal without it, though to us the ta&s;te was as di&s;agreeable as that of a pickled olive generally is the fir&s;t time it is eaten.</P>
<P>As the making of this mahie depends, like brewing, upon fermentation, &s;o, like brewing, it &s;ometimes fails, without their being able to a&s;certain the cau&s;e; it is very natural, therefore, that the making it &s;hould be connected with &s;uper|&s;titious notions and ceremonies. It generally falls to the lot of the old women, who will &s;uffer no creature to touch any thing belonging to it, but tho&s;e whom they employ as a&s;&s;i&s;|tants, nor even to go into that part of the hou&s;e where the operation is carrying on. Mr. Banks happened to &s;poil a
<PB N="125" REF="013324_0152_0F8FF5258B223840">
large quantity of it only by inadvertently touching a leaf which lay upon it. The old woman, who then pre&s;ided over the&s;e my&s;teries, told him, that the proce&s;s would fail; and immediately uncovered the hole in a fit of vexation and de&s;|pair. Mr. Banks regretted the mi&s;chief he had done, but was &s;omewhat con&s;oled by the opportunity which it gave him of examining the preparation, which perhaps, but for &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch an accident, would never have offered.</P>
<P>Such is their food, to which &s;alt-water is the univer&s;al &s;auce, no meal being eaten without it: tho&s;e who live near the &s;ea have it fetched as it is wanted; tho&s;e who live at &s;ome di&s;tance keep it in large bamboos, which are &s;et up in their hou&s;es, for u&s;e. Salt-water, however, is not their only &s;auce; they make another of the kernels of cocoa-nuts, which being fermented till they di&s;&s;olve into a pa&s;te, &s;omewhat re|&s;embling butter, are beaten up with &s;alt-water. The flavour of this is very &s;trong, and was, when we fir&s;t ta&s;ted it, exceed|ingly nau&s;eous; a little u&s;e, however, reconciled &s;ome of us to it &s;o much, that they preferred it to our own &s;auces, e&s;pe|cially with fi&s;h. The natives &s;eemed to con&s;ider it as a dain|ty, and do not u&s;e it at their common meals; po&s;&s;ibly becau&s;e they think it ill management to u&s;e cocoa-nuts &s;o lavi&s;hly, or perhaps, when we were at the i&s;land, they were &s;carcely ripe enough for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>For drink, they have in general nothing but water, or the juice of the cocoa-nut; the art of producing liquors that in|toxicate, by fermentation, being happily unknown among them; neither have they any narcotic which they chew, as the natives of &s;ome other countries do opium, beetle-root, and tobacco. Some of them drank freely of our liquors, and in a few in&s;tances became very drunk; but the per&s;ons to whom this happened were &s;o far from de&s;iring to repeat the debauch, that they would never touch any of our liquors afterwards. We were however informed, that they became drunk by drink|ing a juice that is expre&s;&s;ed from the leaves of a plant which they call <HI>Ava Ava.</HI> This plant was not in &s;ea&s;on when we were there, &s;o that we &s;aw no in&s;tances of its effects; and as they con&s;idered drunkenne&s;s as a di&s;grace, they probably would have concealed from us any in&s;tances which might have hap|pened during our &s;tay. This vice is almo&s;t peculiar to the Chiefs, and con&s;iderable per&s;ons, who vie with each other in drinking the greate&s;t number of draughts, each draught being about a pint. They keep this intoxicating juice with great care from their women.</P>
<P>Table they have none; but their apparatus for eating is &s;et out with great neatne&s;s, though the articles are too &s;imple and too few to allow any thing for &s;how; and they commonly eat alone; but when a &s;tranger happens to vi&s;it them, he
<PB N="126" REF="013324_0153_0F8FF5269ECFD910">
&s;ometimes makes a &s;econd in their me&s;s. Of the meal of one of their principal people I &s;hall give a particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>He &s;its down under the &s;hade of the next tree, or on the &s;hady &s;ide of his hou&s;e, and a large quantity of leaves, either of the bread-fruit or banana, are neatly &s;pread before him upon the ground as a table-cloth; a ba&s;ket is then &s;et by him that contains his provi&s;ion, which, if fi&s;h or fle&s;h, is ready dre&s;&s;ed, and wrapped up in leaves, and two cocoa-nut &s;hells, one full of &s;alt water, and the other of fre&s;h: his attendants, which are not few, &s;eat them&s;elves round him, and when all is ready, he begins by wa&s;hing his hands and his mouth tho|roughly with the fre&s;h-water, and this he repeats almo&s;t continu|ally throughout the whole meal; he then takes part of his provi&s;ion out of the ba&s;ket, which generally con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall fi&s;h or two, two or three bread-fruits, fourteen or fifteen ripe bananas, or &s;ix or &s;even apples: he fir&s;t takes half a bread-fruit, peels off the rind, and takes out the core with his nails; of this he puts as much into his mouth as it can hold, and while he chews it, takes the fi&s;h out of the leaves, and breaks one of them into the &s;alt water, placing the other, and what re|mains of the bread-fruit, upon the leaves that had been &s;pread before him. When this is done, he takes up a &s;mall piece of the fi&s;h that has been broken into the &s;alt-water, with all the fingers of one hand, and &s;ucks it into his mouth, &s;o as to get with it as much of the &s;alt-water as po&s;&s;ible: in the &s;ame manner he takes the re&s;t by different mor&s;els, and between each, atlea&s;t very frequently, takes a &s;mall &s;up of the &s;alt-water, either out of the cocoa-nut &s;hell, or the palm of his hand: in the mean time one of his attendants has prepared a young co|coa-nut, by peeling off the outer rind with his teeth, an ope|ration which to an European appears very &s;urpri&s;ing; but it depends &s;o much upon &s;light, that many of us were able to do it before we left the i&s;land, and &s;ome that could &s;carcely crack a filbert: the ma&s;ter, when he chu&s;es to drink, takes the cocoa-nut thus prepared, and boring a hole through the &s;hell with his finger, or breaking it with a &s;tone, he &s;ucks out the liquor. When he has eaten his bread-fruit and fi&s;h, he begins with his plantains, one of which makes but a mouth|ful, though it be as big as a black-pudding; if in&s;tead of plantains he has apples, he never ta&s;tes them till they have been pared; to do this a &s;hell is picked up from the ground, where they are always in plenty, and to&s;&s;ed to him by an at|tendant: he immediately begins to cut or &s;crape off the rind, but &s;o awkwardly that great part of the fruit is wa&s;ted. If, in|&s;tead of fi&s;h, he has fle&s;h, he mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;uccedaneum for a knife to divide it; and for this purpo&s;e a piece of bamboo is to&s;&s;ed to him, of which he makes the nece&s;&s;ary implement by &s;pitting it tran&s;ver&s;ely with his nail. While all this has been
<PB N="127" REF="013324_0154_0F8FF52702268598">
doing, &s;ome of his attendants have been employed in beating bread-fruit with a &s;tone pe&s;tle upon a block of wood; by be|ing beaten in this manner, and &s;prinkled from time to time with water, it is reduced to the con&s;i&s;tence of a &s;oft pa&s;te, and is then put into a ve&s;&s;el &s;omewhat like a butcher's tray, and either made up alone, or mixed with banana or mahie, accord|ing to the ta&s;te of the ma&s;ter, by pouring water upon it by degrees, and &s;queezing it often through the hand: under this operation it acquires the con&s;i&s;tence of a thick cu&s;tard, and a large cocoa-nut &s;hell full of it being &s;et before him, he &s;ips it as we &s;hould do a jelly if we had no &s;poon to take it from the gla&s;s: the meal is then fini&s;hed by again wa&s;hing his hands and his mouth. After which the cocoa-nut &s;hells are cleaned, and every thing that is left is replaced in the ba&s;ket.</P>
<P>The quantity of food which the&s;e people eat at a meal is prodigious: I have &s;een one man devour two or three fi&s;hes as big as a perch; three bread-fruits, each bigger than two fi&s;ts; foureen or fifteen plantains or bananas, each of them &s;ix or &s;even inches long, and four or five round; and near a quart of the pounded bread-fruit, which is as &s;ub&s;tantial as the thick|e&s;t unbaked cu&s;tard. This is &s;o extraordinary that I &s;carcely expect to be believed; and I would not have related it upon my own &s;ingle te&s;timony, but Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and mo&s;t of the other Gentlemen, have had ocular demon&s;tration of its truth, and know that I mention them upon the occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is very wonderful, that the&s;e people, who are remark|ably fond of &s;ociety, and particularly that of their women, &s;hould exclude its plea&s;ures from the table, where among all other nations, whether civil or &s;avage, they have been prin|cipally enjoyed. How a meal, which every where el&s;e brings families and friends together, came to &s;eparate them here, we often enquired, but could never learn. They eat alone, they &s;aid, becau&s;e it was right; but why it was right to eat alone, they never attempted to tell us: &s;uch, however, was the force of habit, that they expre&s;&s;ed the &s;tronge&s;t di&s;like, and even di&s;gu&s;t, at our eating in &s;ociety, e&s;pecially with our women, and of the &s;ame victuals. At fir&s;t, we thought this &s;trange &s;ingularity aro&s;e from &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious opinion; but they con&s;tantly affirmed the contrary. We ob&s;erved al&s;o &s;ome ca|prices in the cu&s;tom, for which we could as little account as for the cu&s;tom it&s;elf. We could never prevail with any of the women to partake of the victuals at our table when we were dining in company; yet they would go five or &s;ix together, into the &s;ervants apartments, and there eat very heartily of whatever they could find, of which I have before given a par|ticular in&s;tance; nor were they in the lea&s;t di&s;concerted if we came in while they were doing it. When any of us have been
<PB N="128" REF="013324_0155_0F8FF527EC57F978">
alone with a women, &s;he has &s;ometimes eaten in our compa|ny; but then &s;he has expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t unwillingne&s;s that it &s;hould be known, and always extorted the &s;tronge&s;t promi&s;es of &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>Among them&s;elves, even two brothers and two &s;i&s;ters have each their &s;eparate ba&s;kets, with provi&s;ion and the apparatus of their meal. When they fir&s;t vi&s;ited us at our tents, each brought his ba&s;ket with him; and when we &s;at down to table, they would go out, &s;it down upon the ground, at two or three yards di&s;tance from each other, and turning their faces diffe|rent ways, take their repa&s;t without interchanging a &s;ingle word.</P>
<P>The women not only ab&s;tain from eating with the men, and of the &s;ame victuals, but even have their victuals &s;epa|rately prepared by boys kept for that purpo&s;e, who depo&s;it it in a &s;eparate &s;hed, and attend them with it at their meals.</P>
<P>But though they would not eat with us, or with each other, they have often a&s;ked us to eat with them, when we have vi&s;ited tho&s;e with whom we were particularly acquainted at their hou&s;es; and we have often upon &s;uch occa&s;ions eaten out of the &s;ame ba&s;ket, and drunk out of the &s;ame cup. The elder women, however, always appeared to be offended at this liberty; and if we happened to touch their victuals, or even the ba&s;ket that contained it, would throw it away.</P>
<P>After meals, and in the heat of the day, the middle-aged people of the better &s;ort generally &s;leep; they are indeed ex|tremely indolent, and &s;leeping and eating is almo&s;t all that they do. Tho&s;e that are older are le&s;s drowzy, and the boys and girls are kept awake by the natural activity and &s;prightli|ne&s;s of their age.</P>
<P>Their amu&s;ements have occa&s;ionally been mentioned in my account of the incidents that happened during our re&s;idence in this i&s;land, particularly mu&s;ic, dancing, wre&s;tling, and &s;hoot|ing with the bow; they al&s;o &s;ometimes vie with each other in throwing a lance. As &s;hooting is not at a mark, but for di&s;|tance; throwing the lance is not for di&s;tance, but at a mark: the weapon is about nine feet long, the mark is the bole of a plantain, and the di&s;tance about twenty yards.</P>
<P>Their only mu&s;ical in&s;truments are flutes and drums; the flutes are made of a hollow bamboo about a foot long, and, as has been ob&s;erved before, have only two &s;tops, and con&s;e|quently but four notes, out of which they &s;eem hitherto to have formed but one tune; to the&s;e &s;tops they apply the fore-finger of the left hand, and the middle finger of the right.</P>
<P>The drum is made of a hollow block of wood, of a cylin|drical form, &s;olid at one end, and covered at the other with &s;hark's &s;kin: the&s;e they beat not with &s;ticks, but their hands; and they know how to tune two drums of different notes into concord. They have al&s;o an expedient to bring the flutes
<PB N="129" REF="013324_0156_0F90F0BBB30A2598">
that play together into uni&s;on, which is to roll up a leaf &s;o as to &s;lip over the end of the &s;horte&s;t, like our &s;liding tubes for tele&s;copes, which they move up or down till the purpo&s;e is an&s;wered, of which they &s;eem to judge by their ear with great nicety.</P>
<P>To the&s;e in&s;truments they &s;ing; and, as I have ob&s;erved before, their &s;ongs are often extempore: they call every two ver&s;es or couplet a &s;ong, <HI>Pehay:</HI> they are generally, though not always in rhime; and when pronounced by the natives, we could di&s;cover that they were metre. Mr. Banks took great pains to write down &s;ome of them which were made upon our arrival, as nearly as he could expre&s;s their &s;ounds by com|binations of our letters; but when we read them, not having their accent, we could &s;carcely make them either metre or rhime. The reader will ea&s;ily perceive that they are of very different &s;tructure.</P>

<P>Of the&s;e ver&s;es our knowledge of the language is too imper|fect to attempt a tran&s;lation. They frequently amu&s;e them|&s;elves by &s;inging &s;uch couplets as the&s;e when they are alone, or with their families, e&s;pecially after it is dark; for though they need no fires, they are not without the comfort of artifi|cial light between &s;un&s;et and bed-time. Their candles are made of the kernels of a kind of oily nut, which they &s;tick one over another upon a &s;kewer that is thru&s;t thro' the middle of them; the upper one being lighted, burns down to the &s;e|cond, at the &s;ame time con&s;uming that part of the &s;kewer which goes through it; the &s;econd taking fire burns in the &s;ame manner down to the third, and &s;o of the re&s;t: &s;ome of the&s;e candles will burn a con&s;iderable time, and they give a very tolerable light. They do not often &s;it up above an hour after it is dark; but when they have &s;trangers who &s;leep in the hou&s;e, they generally keep a light burning all night, po&s;&s;ibly as a check upon &s;uch of the women as they wi&s;h not to honour them with their favours.</P>
<P>Of their itenerary concerts I need add nothing to what has been &s;aid already; e&s;pecially as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion, more particularly to mention them when I relate our adventures upon another i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="013324_0157_0F90F0BC74F4F220">
In other countries, the girls and unmarried women are &s;up|po&s;ed to be wholly ignorant of what others upon &s;ome occa|&s;ions may appear to know; and their conduct and conver&s;ation are con&s;equently re&s;trained within narrower bounds, and kept at a more remote di&s;tance from whatever relates to a connection with the other &s;ex: but here it is ju&s;t contrary. Among other diver&s;ions, there is a dance, called <HI>Timorodee,</HI> which is per|formed by young girls, whenever eight or ten of them can be collected together, con&s;i&s;ting of motions and ge&s;tures beyond imagination wanton, in the practice of which they are brought up from their earlie&s;t childhood, accompanied by words, which, if it were po&s;&s;ible, would more explicitly convey the &s;ame ideas. In the&s;e dances they keep time with an exactne&s;s which is &s;carcely excelled by the be&s;t performers upon the &s;tages of Europe. But the practice which is allowed to the virgin, is prohibited to the woman from the moment that &s;he has put the&s;e hopeful le&s;&s;ons in practice, and realized the &s;ym|bols of the dance.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that, among the&s;e people, cha&s;tity is held in much e&s;timation. It might be expected that &s;i&s;ters and daughters would be offered to &s;trangers, either as a cour|te&s;y, or for reward; and that breaches of conjugal fidelity, even in the wife, &s;hould not be otherwi&s;e puni&s;hed than by a few hard words, or perhaps a &s;light beating, as indeed is the ca&s;e; but there is a &s;cale in di&s;&s;olute &s;en&s;uality, which the&s;e people have a&s;cended, wholly unknown to every other nation who&s;e manners have been recorded from the beginning of the world to the pre&s;ent hour, and which no imagination could po&s;&s;ibly conceive.</P>
<P>A very con&s;iderable number of the principal people of Ota|heite, of both &s;exes, have formed them&s;elves into a &s;ociety, in which every woman is common to every man; thus &s;ecur|ing a perpetual variety as often as their inclination prompts them to &s;eek it, which is &s;o frequent, that the &s;ame man and woman &s;eldom cohabit together more than two or three days.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ocieties are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Arreoy;</HI> and the members have meetings, at which no other is pre|&s;ent, where the men amu&s;e them&s;elves by wre&s;tling, and the women, notwith&s;tanding their occa&s;ional connection with different men, dance the Timorodee in all its latitude, as an incitement to de&s;ires, which, it is &s;aid, are frequently grati|fied upon the &s;pot. This however is comparatively nothing, if any of the women happen to be with child, which in this manner of life happens le&s;s frequently than if they were to co|habit only with one man, the poor infant is &s;mothered the moment it is born, that it may be no incumberance to the father, nor interrupt the mother in the plea&s;ures of her dia|bolical pro&s;titution. It &s;ometimes indeed happens, that the
<PB N="131" REF="013324_0158_0F8FF5287AC2F030">
pa&s;&s;ion which prompts a woman to enter into this &s;ociety, is &s;urmounted when &s;he becomes a mother, by that in&s;tinctive affection which nature has given to all creatures for the pre|&s;ervation of their offspring; but even in this ca&s;e &s;he is not permitted to &s;pare the life of her infant, except &s;he can find a man who will patroni&s;e it as his child: if this can be done, the murder is prevented; but both the man and the woman, being deemed by this act to have appropriated each other, are ejected from the community, and forfeit all claim to the privileges and plea&s;ures of Arreoy for the future; the woman from that time being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the term <HI>Whannownow,</HI> "bearer of children," which is here a term of reproach; though none can be more honourable in the e&s;timation of wi&s;|dom and humanity, of right rea&s;on, and every pa&s;&s;ion that di&s;tingui&s;hes the man from the brute.</P>
<P>It is not fit that a practice &s;o horrid and &s;o &s;trange &s;hould be imputed to human beings upon &s;light evidence, but I have &s;uch as abundantly ju&s;tifies me in the account I have given. The people them&s;elves are &s;o far from concealing their con|nection with &s;uch a &s;ociety as a di&s;grace, that they boa&s;t of it as a privilege; and both my&s;elf and Mr. Banks, when par|ticular per&s;ons have been pointed out to us as members of the Arreoy, have que&s;tioned them about it, and received the ac|count that has been here given from their own lips. They have acknowledged, that they had long been of this accur&s;ed &s;ociety, that they belonged to it at that time, and that &s;eve|ral of their children had been put to death.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not conclude my account of the dome&s;tic life of the&s;e people without mentioning their per&s;onal cleanline&s;s. If that which le&s;&s;ens the good of life and increa&s;es the evil is vice, &s;urely cleanline&s;s is a virtue: the want of it tends to de&s;troy both beauty and health, and mingles di&s;gu&s;t with our be&s;t plea&s;ures. The natives of Otaheite, both men and wo|men, con&s;tantly wa&s;h their whole bodies in running water three times every day; once as &s;oon as they ri&s;e in the morn|ing, once at noon, and again before they &s;leep at night, whether the &s;ea or river is near them or at a di&s;tance. I have already ob&s;erved, that they wa&s;h not only the mouth, but the hands at their meals, almo&s;t between every mor&s;el; and their clothes, as well as their per&s;ons, are kept without &s;pot or &s;tain; &s;o that in a large company of the&s;e people, nothing is &s;uffered but heat, which, perhaps, is more than can be &s;aid of the polite&s;t a&s;&s;embly in Europe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Of the Manufactures, Boats, and Navigation of Otaheite.</HEAD>
<P>IF nece&s;&s;ity is the mother of invention, it cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to have been much exerted where the liberality of
<PB N="132" REF="013324_0159_0F8FF52AD0EDBD80">
nature has rendered the diligence of art almo&s;t &s;uperfluous; yet there are many in&s;tances both of ingenuity and labour among the&s;e people, which, con&s;idering the want of metal for tools, do honour to both.</P>
<P>Their principal manufacture is their cloth, in the making and dying of which I think there are &s;ome particulars which may in&s;truct even the artificers of Great-Britain, and for that rea&s;on my de&s;cription will be more minute.</P>
<P>Their cloth is of three kinds; and it is made of the bark of three different trees, the Chine&s;e paper mulberry, the bread-fruit tree, and the tree which re&s;embles the wild fig-tree of the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t and white&s;t is made of the paper mulberry, <HI>Aouta;</HI> this is worn chiefly by the principal people, and when it is dyed red takes a better colour. A &s;econd &s;ort, inferior in whitene&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s, is made of the bread-fruit tree, <HI>Ooroo,</HI> and worn chiefly by the inferior peo|ple; and a third of the tree that re&s;embles the fig, which is coar&s;e and har&s;h, and of the colour of the darke&s;t brown pa|per: this, though it is le&s;s plea&s;ing both to the eye and the touch, is the mo&s;t valuable, becau&s;e it re&s;i&s;ts water, which the other two &s;orts will not. Of this, which is the mo&s;t rare as well as the mo&s;t u&s;eful, the greater part is perfumed, and worn by the Chiefs as a morning dre&s;s.</P>
<P>All the&s;e trees are propagated with great care, particularly the mulberry, which covers the large&s;t part of the cultivated land, and is not fit for u&s;e after two or three year's growth, when it is about &s;ix or eight feet high, and &s;omewhat thicker than a man's thumb; its excellence is to be thin, &s;trait, tall, and without branches: the lower leaves, therefore, are care|fully plucked off, with the germs, as often as there is any ap|pearance of their producing a branch.</P>
<P>But though the cloth made of the&s;e three trees is different, it is all manufactured in the &s;ame manner; I &s;hall, therefore, de&s;cribe the proce&s;s only in the fine &s;ort, that is made of the mulberry. When the trees are of a proper &s;ize, they are drawn up, and &s;tripped of their branches, after which the roots and tops are cut off; the bark of the&s;e rods being then &s;lit up longitudinally, is ea&s;ily drawn off, and, when a pro|per quantity has been procured, it is carried down to &s;ome running water, in which it is depo&s;ited to &s;oak, and &s;ecured from floating away by heavy &s;tones: when it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficiently &s;oftened, the women &s;ervants go down to the brook, and &s;tripping them&s;elves, &s;it down in the water, to &s;eparate the inner bark from the green part on the out&s;ide; to do this they place the under &s;ide upon a flat &s;mooth board, and with the &s;hell which our dealers call Tyger's tongue, <HI>Tel|lina gargadia,</HI> &s;crape it very carefully, dipping it continually
<PB N="133" REF="013324_0160_0F90F0BD34629178">
in the water till nothing remains but the fine fibres of the in|ner coat. Being thus prepared in the afternoon, they are &s;pread out upon plantain leaves in the evening; and in this part of the work there appears to be &s;ome difficulty, as the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family always &s;uperintends the doing of it; they are placed in lengths of about eleven or twelve yards, one by the &s;ide of another, till they are about a foot broad, and two or three layers are al&s;o laid one upon the other: care is taken that the cloth &s;hall be in all parts of an equal thickne&s;s, &s;o that if the bark happens to be thinner in any particular part of one layer than the re&s;t, a piece that is &s;omewhat thicker is picked out to be laid over it in the next. In this &s;tate it re|mains till the morning, when great part of the water which it contained when it was laid out, is either drained off or evapo|rated, and the &s;everal fibres adhere together, &s;o as that the whole may be rai&s;ed from the ground in one piece.</P>
<P>It is then taken away, and laid upon the &s;mooth &s;ide of a long piece of wood, prepared for the purpo&s;e, and beaten by the women &s;ervants, with in&s;truments about a foot long, and three inches thick, made of a hard wood which they call <HI>Etoa.</HI> The &s;hape of this in&s;trument is not unlike a &s;quare razor &s;trop, only that the handle is longer, and each of its four &s;ides or faces is marked lengthways, with &s;mall grooves, or furrows, of different degrees of finene&s;s; tho&s;e on one &s;ide being of a width and depth &s;ufficient to receive a &s;mall packthread, and the others finer in a regular gradation, &s;o that the la&s;t are not more than equal to &s;ewing &s;ilk.</P>
<P>They beat it fir&s;t with the coar&s;e&s;t &s;ide of this mallet, keep|ing time like our &s;miths; it &s;preads very fa&s;t under the &s;trokes, chiefly however in the breadth, and the grooves in the mallet mark it with the appearance of threads; it is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively beaten with the other &s;ides, la&s;t with the fine&s;t, and is then fit for u&s;e. Sometimes however it is made &s;till thinner, by beat|ing with the fine&s;t &s;ide of the mallet, after it has been &s;everal times doubled: it is then called <HI>Hoboo,</HI> and is almo&s;t as thin as a mu&s;lin; it becomes very white by being bleached in the air, but is made &s;till whiter and &s;ofter by being wa&s;hed and beaten again after it has been worn.</P>
<P>Of this cloth there are &s;everal &s;orts, of different degrees of finene&s;s, in proportion as it is more or le&s;s beaten, without be|ing doubled, the other cloth al&s;o differs in proportion as it is beaten; but they differ from each other in con&s;equence of the different materials of which they are made. The bark of the bread-fruit is not taken till the trees are con&s;iderably longer and thicker than tho&s;e of the fig: the proce&s;s afterwards is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When cloth is to be wa&s;hed after it has been worn, it it taken down to the brook, and left to &s;oak, being kept fa&s;t to the bottom, as at fir&s;t, by a &s;tone; it is then gently wrung or &s;queezed; and &s;ometimes &s;everal pieces of it are laid one upon
<PB N="134" REF="013324_0161_0F8FF52BAA17C5A8">
another, and beaten together with the coar&s;e&s;t &s;ide of the mal|let, and they are then equal in thickne&s;s to broadcloth, and much more &s;oft and agreeable to the touch, after they have been a little while in u&s;e, though, when they come imme|diately from the mallet, they feel as if they had been &s;tarched. This cloth &s;ometimes breaks in the beating, but is ea&s;ily re|paired by pa&s;ting on a patch with a gluten that is prepared from the root of the <HI>Pea,</HI> which is done &s;o nicely that it can|not be di&s;covered. The women al&s;o employ them&s;elves in re|moving blemi&s;hes of every kind, as our ladies do in needle|work or knotting; &s;ometimes when their work is intended to be very fine, they will pa&s;te an entire covering of hoboo over the whole. The principal excellencies of this cloth are its coolne&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s; and its imperfections, its being per|vious to water like paper, and almo&s;t as ea&s;ily torn.</P>
<P>The colours with which they die this cloth are principally red and yellow. The red is exceedingly beautiful, and I may venture to &s;ay, a brighter and more delicate colour than any we have in Europe; that which approaches neare&s;t is our full &s;carlet, and the be&s;t imitation which Mr. Banks's natural hi&s;|tory painter could produce, was by a mixture of vermillion and carm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne. The yellow is al&s;o a bright colour, but we have many as good.</P>
<P>The red colour is produced by the mixture of the juices of two vegetables, neither of which &s;eparately has the lea&s;t ten|dency to that hue. One is a &s;pecies of fig, called here <HI>Matte,</HI> and the other the <HI>Cordia Sebe&s;tina,</HI> or <HI>Etou;</HI> of the fig the fruit is u&s;ed, and of the <HI>Cordia</HI> the leaves.</P>
<P>The fruit of the fig is about as big as a rounceval pea, or very &s;mall goo&s;eberry; and each of them, upon breaking off the &s;talk very clo&s;e, produces one drop of a milky liquor, re|&s;embling the juice of our figs, of which the tree indeed is a &s;pecies. This liquor the women collect into a &s;mall quantity of cocoa-nut water: to prepare a gill of cocoa-nut water will require between three and four quarts of the&s;e little figs. When a &s;ufficient quantity is prepared, the leaves of the Etou are well wetted in it, and then laid upon a plantain leaf, where they are turned about till they become more and more flaccid, and then they are gently &s;queezed, gradually increa&s;|ing the pre&s;&s;ure, but &s;o as not to break them; as the flaccidi|ty increa&s;es, and they become &s;pungy, they are &s;upplied with more of the liquor; in about five minutes the colour begins to appear upon the veins of the leaves, and in about ten or a little more, they are perfectly &s;aturated with it: they are then &s;queezed, with as much force as can be applied, and the li|quor &s;trained at the &s;ame time that it is expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e the boys prepare a large quantity of the Moo, by drawing it between their teeth, or two little &s;ticks,
<PB N="135" REF="013324_0162_0F8FF52D060C04F8">
till it is freed from the green bark, and the branny &s;ub&s;tance that lies under it, and a thin web of the fibres only remains; in this the leaves of the Etou are inveloped, and through the&s;e the juice which they contain is &s;trained as it is forced out. As the leaves are not &s;ucculent, little more juice is pre&s;&s;ed out of them than they have imbibed: when they have been once emptied, they are filled again, and again pre&s;&s;ed till the qua|lity which tinctures the liquor, as it pa&s;&s;es through them is exhau&s;ted, they are then thrown away; but the Moo, being deeply &s;tained with the colour, is pre&s;erved, as a bru&s;h to lay the dye upon the cloth.</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ed liquor is always received into &s;mall cups, made of the plantain leaf, whether from a notion that it has any quality favourable to the colour, or from the facility with which it is procured, and the convenience of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els to di&s;tribute it among the artificers, I do not know.</P>
<P>Of the thin cloth they &s;eldom dye more than the edges, but the thick cloth is coloured through the whole &s;urface; the li|quor is indeed u&s;ed rather as a pigment than a dye, for a coat of it is laid upon one &s;ide only, with the fibres of the Moo; and though I have &s;een of the thin cloth that has appeared to have been &s;oaked in the liquor, the colour has not had the &s;ame richne&s;s and lu&s;tre, as when it has been applied in the other manner.</P>
<P>Though the leaf of the Etou is generally u&s;ed in this pro|ce&s;s, and probably produces the fine&s;t colour; yet the juice of the figs will produce a red by a mixture with the &s;pecies of Turnefortia, which they call <HI>Taheinoo,</HI> the <HI>Eurhe</HI> or <HI>Con|volvulus Bra&s;ilien&s;is,</HI> and a &s;pecies of Solanum called <HI>Ebooa;</HI> from the u&s;e the&s;e different plants, or from different propor|tions of the materials, many varieties are ob&s;ervable in the colours of their cloth, &s;ome of which are con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;upe|rior to others.</P>
<P>The beauty, however, of the be&s;t is not permanent; but it is probable that &s;ome method might be found to fix it, if proper experiments were made, and perhaps to &s;earch for latent qualities, which may be brought out by the mixture of one vegetable juice with another, would not be an unprofitable employment: our pre&s;ent mo&s;t valuable dyes afford &s;ufficient encouragement to the attempt: for by the meer in&s;pection of indigo, woad, dyer's weed, and mo&s;t of the leaves which are u&s;ed for the like purpo&s;es the colours which they yield could never be di&s;covered. Of this Indian red I &s;hall only add, that the women who have been employed in preparing or u&s;ing it, carefully pre&s;erve the colour upon their fingers and nails, where it appears in its utmo&s;t beauty, as a great ornament.</P>
<P>The yellow is made of the bark of the root of the <HI>Morinda citrifolia,</HI> called <HI>Nono,</HI> by &s;craping and infu&s;ing it into water;
<PB N="136" REF="013324_0163_0F90F0BDF3D5FD30">
after &s;tanding &s;ome time, the water is &s;trained and u&s;ed as a dye, the cloth being dipped into it. The Morinda, of which this is a &s;pecies, &s;eems to be a good &s;ubject for examination with a view to dying. Brown, in his hi&s;tory of Jamaica, mentions three &s;pecies of it, which, he &s;ays, are u&s;ed to dye brown; and Rumphius &s;ays of the <HI>Bancuda Augu&s;tifolia,</HI> which is nearly allied to our Nono, that it is u&s;ed by the inhabitants of the Ea&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, as a fixing drug for red colours, with which it particularly agrees.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this i&s;land al&s;o dye yellow with the fruit of the Tamanu; but how the colour is extracted, we had no opportunity to di&s;cover. They have al&s;o a preparation with which they die brown and black; but the&s;e colours are &s;o in|different, that the method of preparing them did not excite our curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable mannfacture is matting of various kinds; &s;ome of which is finer, and better in every re&s;pect, than any we have in Europe: the coar&s;er &s;ort &s;erves them to &s;leep upon, and the &s;iner to wear in wet weather. With the fine, of which there are al&s;o two &s;orts, much pains is taken, e&s;pecially with that made of the bark of the Poerou, the <HI>Hi|bi&s;cus tiliaceus</HI> of Linaeus, &s;ome of which is as fine as a coar&s;e cloth: the other &s;ort, which is &s;till more beautiful, they call <HI>Vanne;</HI> it is white, glo&s;&s;y, and &s;hining, and is made of the leaves of their <HI>Wharrou,</HI> a &s;pecies of the <HI>Pandanus,</HI> of which we had no opportunity to &s;ee either the flowers or fruit: they have other matts, or as they call them <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eas,</HI> to &s;it or to &s;leep upon, which are formed of a great variety of ru&s;hes and gra&s;s, and which they make, as they do every thing el&s;e that is plaited, with amazing facility and di&s;patch.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o very dexterous in making ba&s;ket and wicker|work; their ba&s;kets are of a thou&s;and different patterns, ma|ny of them exceedingly neat; and the making them is an art that every one practi&s;es, both men and women: they make occa&s;ional ba&s;kets and panniers of the cocoa-nut leaf in a few minutes, and the women who vi&s;ited us early in a morn|ing u&s;ed to &s;end, as &s;oon as the &s;un was high, for a few of the leaves, of which they made little bonnets to &s;hade their faces, at &s;o &s;mall an expence of time and trouble, that, when the &s;un was low again in the evening, they u&s;ed to throw them away. The&s;e bonnets, however, did not cover the head, but con&s;i&s;ted only of a band that went round it, and a &s;hade that projected from the forehead.</P>
<P>Of the bark of the Poerou they make ropes and lines, from the thickne&s;s of an inch, to the &s;ize of a &s;mall packthread: with the&s;e they make nets for fi&s;hing: of the fibres of the cocoa-nut they make thread, for fa&s;tening together the &s;eve|ral parts of their canoes, and belts, either round or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lat,
<PB N="137" REF="013324_0164_0F8FF52DC4644C50">
twi&s;ted or plaited; and of the bark of the <HI>Erowa,</HI> a kind of nettle which grows in the mountains, and is therefore rather &s;carce, they make the be&s;t fi&s;hing lines in the world: with the&s;e they hold the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t active fi&s;h, &s;uch as Bo|netas and Albicores, which would &s;nap our &s;tronge&s;t &s;ilk lines in a minute, though they are twice as thick.</P>
<P>They make al&s;o a kind of &s;eine, of a coar&s;e broad gra&s;s, the blades of which are like flags: the&s;e they twi&s;t and tie to|gether in a loo&s;e manner, till the net, which is about as wide as a large &s;ack, is from &s;ixty to eighty fathom long; this they haul in &s;hoal &s;mooth water, and its own weight keeps it &s;o clo&s;e to the ground that &s;carcely a &s;ingle fi&s;h can e&s;cape.</P>
<P>In every expedient, indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or taking fi&s;h, they are ex|ceedingly ingenious; they make harpoons of cane, and point them with hard wood, which in their hands &s;trike fi&s;h more effectually, than tho&s;e that are headed with iron can do in ours, &s;etting a&s;ide the advantage of ours being fa&s;tened to a line, &s;o that the fi&s;h is &s;ecured if the hook takes place, though it does not mortally wound him.</P>
<P>Of fi&s;h-hooks they have two &s;orts, admirably adapted in their con&s;truction, as well to the purpo&s;e they are to an&s;wer, as to the materials of which they are made. One of the&s;e, which they call <HI>Wittee Wittee,</HI> is u&s;ed for towing. The &s;hank is made of mother of pearl, the mo&s;t glo&s;&s;y that can be got: the in&s;ide, which is naturally the brighte&s;t, is put behind. To the&s;e hooks a tuft of white dog's or hog's hair is fixed, &s;o as &s;omewhat to re&s;emble the tail of a fi&s;h; the&s;e implements, therefore, are both hook and bait, and are u&s;ed with a rod of bamboo, and line of <HI>Erowa.</HI> The fi&s;her, to &s;ecure his &s;uc|ce&s;s, watches the flight of the birds which con&s;tantly attend the Bonetas when they &s;wim in &s;hoals, by which he directs his canoe, and when he has the advantage of the&s;e guides, he &s;eldom returns without a prize.</P>
<P>The other kind of hook is al&s;o made of mother of pearl, or &s;ome other hard &s;hell: they cannot make them bearded like our hooks; but to effect the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they make the point turn inwards. The&s;e are made of all &s;izes, and u&s;ed to catch various kinds of fi&s;h, with great &s;ucce&s;s. The manner of making them is very &s;imple, and every fi&s;herman is his own artificer: the &s;hell is fir&s;t cut into &s;quare pieces, by the edge of another &s;hell, and wrought into a form corre|&s;ponding with the outline of the hook by pieces of coral, which are &s;ufficiently rough to perform the office of a file; a hole is then bored in the middle, the drill being no other than the fir&s;t &s;tone they pick up that has a &s;harp corner: this they fix into the end of a piece of bamboo, and turn it between the hands like a chocolate mill; when the &s;hell is perforated, and the hole &s;ufficiently wide, a &s;mall file of coral is intro|duced,
<PB N="138" REF="013324_0165_0F90F0BEB4AE05E0">
by the application of which the hook is in a &s;hort time compleated, few co&s;ting the artificer more time than a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>Of their ma&s;onry, carving, and architecture, the reader has already formed &s;ome idea from the account that has been given of the Morais, or repo&s;itories of the dead: the other mo&s;t important article of building and carving is their boats; and perhaps, to fabricate one of their principal ve&s;&s;els with their tools, is as great a work, as to build a Briti&s;h man of war with ours.</P>
<P>They have an adze of &s;tone; a chi&s;&s;el, or gouge, of bone, generally that of a man's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> between the wri&s;t and elbow; a ra&s;p of coral; and the &s;kin of a &s;ting-ray, with coral &s;and, as a file or poli&s;her.</P>
<P>This is a complete catalogue of their tools, and with the&s;e they build hou&s;es, con&s;truct canoes, hew &s;tone, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, cleave, carve, and poli&s;h timber.</P>
<P>The &s;tone which makes the blade of their adzes is a kind of Ba&s;altes, of a blacki&s;h or grey colour, not very hard, but of con&s;iderable toughne&s;s: they are formed of different &s;izes; &s;ome, that are intended for felling, weigh from &s;ix to eight pounds; others, that are u&s;ed for carving, not more than &s;o many ounces; but it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;harpen both almo&s;t eve|ry minute; for which purpo&s;e, a &s;tone and a cocoa-nut &s;hell full of water are always at hand.</P>
<P>Their greate&s;t exploit, to which the&s;e tools are le&s;s equal than to any other, is felling a tree: this requires many hands, and the con&s;tant labour of &s;everal days. When it is down, they &s;plit it, with the grain, into planks from three to four inches thick, the whole length and breadth of the tree, ma|ny of which are eight feet in girt, and forty to the branches, and nearly of the &s;ame thickne&s;s throughout. The tree ge|nerally u&s;ed in their language called <HI>Avi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> the &s;tem of which is tall and &s;tait; though &s;ome of the &s;maller boats are made of the bread-fruit tree, which is a light &s;pongy wood, and ea&s;ily wrought. They &s;mooth the plank very expeditiou&s;ly and dexterou&s;ly with their adzes, and can take off a thin coat from a whole plank without mi&s;&s;ing a &s;troke. As they have not the art of warping a plank, every part of the canoe, whe|ther hollow or flat, is &s;haped by hand.</P>
<P>The canoes, or boats, which are u&s;ed by the inhabitants of this and the neighbouring i&s;lands, may be divided into two general cla&s;&s;es; one of which they call <HI>Ivahahs,</HI> the other <HI>Pahies.</HI></P>
<P>The Ivahah is u&s;ed for &s;hort excur&s;ions to &s;ea, and is wall|&s;ided and flat-bottomed; the Pahie for longer voyages, and is bow-&s;ided and &s;harp-bottomed. The Ivahas are all of the &s;ame figure, but of different fixes, and u&s;ed for different pur|po&s;es;
<PB N="139" REF="013324_0166_0F8FF52E82C61D10">
their length is from &s;eventy-two feet to ten, but the breadth is by no means in proportion; for tho&s;e of ten feet are about a foot wide, and tho&s;e of more than &s;eventy are &s;carcely two. There is the fighting Ivahah, the fi&s;hing Ivahah, and the travelling Ivahah; for &s;ome of the&s;e go from one i&s;land to another. The fighting Ivahah is by far the longe&s;t, and the head and &s;tern are con&s;iderably rai&s;ed above the body, in a &s;e|micircular form; particularly the &s;tern, which is &s;ometimes &s;eventeen or eighteen feet high, though the boat it&s;elf is &s;carcely three. The&s;e never go to &s;ea &s;ingle; but are fa&s;tened together, &s;ide by &s;ide, at the di&s;tance of about three feet, by &s;trong poles of wood, which are laid acro&s;s them and la&s;hed to the gun|wales. Upon the&s;e, in the forepart, a &s;tage or platform is rai&s;ed, about ten or twelve feet long, and &s;omewhat wider than the boats, which is &s;upported by pillars about &s;ix feet high: upon this &s;tage &s;tand the fighting men, who&s;e mi&s;&s;ile weapons are &s;lings and &s;pears; for, among other &s;ingularities in the manners of the&s;e people, their bows and arrows are u&s;ed only for diver&s;ion, as we throw quoits: below the&s;e &s;tages fit the rowers, who receive from them tho&s;e that are wounded, and furni&s;h fre&s;h men to a&s;cend in their room. Some of the&s;e have a platform of bamboos or other light wood, through their whole length, and con&s;iderably broader, by means of which they will carry a great number of men; but we &s;aw only one fitted in this manner.</P>
<P>The fi&s;hing Ivahahs vary in length from about forty feet to the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize, which is about ten; all that are of the length of twenty-five feet and upwards, of whatever &s;ort, occa&s;ionally carry &s;ail. The travelling Ivahah is always double, and fur|ni&s;hed with a &s;mall neat hou&s;e about five or &s;ix feet broad, and &s;ix or &s;even feet long, which is fa&s;tened upon the forepart for the convenience of the principal people, who &s;it in them by day, and &s;leep in them by night. The fi&s;hing Ivahahs are &s;ometimes joined together, and have a hou&s;e on board; but this is not common.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which are &s;horter than five and twenty feet, &s;eldom or never carry &s;ail; and, though the &s;tern ri&s;es about four or five feet, have a flat head, and a board that projects forward about four feet.</P>
<P>The Pahie is al&s;o of different &s;izes, from &s;ixty to thirty feet long; but, like the Ivahah, is very narrow. One that I mea&s;ured was fifty-one feet long, and only one foot and a half wide at the top. In the wide&s;t part, it was about three feet; and this is the general proportion. It does not, however, widen by a gradual &s;well; but the &s;ides being &s;trait, and paral|lel, for a little way below the gunwale, it &s;wells abruptly, and draws to a ridge at the bottom; &s;o that a tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ection of it has &s;omewhat the appearance of the mark upon cards
<PB N="140" REF="013324_0167_0F8FF52F415E43F8">
called a &s;pade, the whole being much wider in proportion to its length. The&s;e, like the large&s;t Ivahahs, are u&s;ed for fight|ing; but principally for long voyages. The fighting Pahie, which is the large&s;t, is fitted with the &s;tage or platform, which is proportionably larger than tho&s;e of the Ivahah, as their form enables them to &s;u&s;tain a much greater weight. Tho&s;e that are u&s;ed for &s;ailing are generally double; and the middle &s;ize are &s;aid to be the be&s;t &s;ea-boats. They are &s;ometimes out a month together, going from i&s;land to i&s;land; and &s;ometimes, as we were credibly informed, they are a fortnight or twenty days at &s;ea, and could keep it longer if they had more &s;towage for provi&s;ions, and conveniencies to hold fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>When any of the&s;e boats carry &s;ail &s;ingle, they make u&s;e of a log of wood which is fa&s;tened to the end of two poles that lie acro&s;s the ve&s;&s;el, and project from &s;ix to ten feet, according to the &s;ize of the ve&s;&s;el, beyond its &s;ide, &s;omewhat like what is u&s;ed by the flying Proa of the Ladrone i&s;lands, and called in the account of Lord An&s;on's voyage, an out-rigger. To this out-rigger the &s;hrouds are fa&s;tened, and it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in trimming the boat when it blows fre&s;h.</P>
<P>Some of them have one ma&s;t, and &s;ome two; they are made of a &s;ingle &s;tick, and when the length of the canoe is thirty feet, that of the ma&s;t is &s;omewhat le&s;s than five and twenty; it is fixed to a frame that is above the canoe, and receives a &s;ail of matting about one third longer than it&s;elf; the &s;ail is pointed at the top, &s;quare at the bottom, and curved at the &s;ide; &s;omewhat re&s;embling what we call a &s;houlder of mutton &s;ail, and u&s;ed for boats belonging to men of war: it is placed in a frame of wood, which &s;urrounds it on every &s;ide, and has no contrivance either for reefing or furling; &s;o that, if either &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary, it mu&s;t be cut away, which, however, in the&s;e equal climates can &s;eldom happen. At the top of the ma&s;t are fa&s;tened ornaments of feathers, which are placed inclining obliquely forwards.</P>
<P>The oars or paddles that are u&s;ed with the&s;e boats, have a long handle and a flat blade, not unlike a baker's peel. Of the&s;e every per&s;on in the boat has one, except tho&s;e that &s;it under the awning; and they pu&s;h her forward with them at a good rate. The&s;e boats, however, admit &s;o much water at the &s;eams, that one per&s;on at lea&s;t is continually employed in throwing it out. The only thing in which they excel is land|ing, and putting off from the &s;hore in a &s;urf: by their great length and high &s;terns they land dry, when our boats could &s;carcely land at all; and have the &s;ame advantages in putting off by the height of their head. The Ivahas are the only boats that are u&s;ed by the inhabitants of Otaheite; but we &s;aw &s;e|veral Pahies that came from other i&s;lands.

<P>When all the parts are prepared, the keel is laid upon blocks, and the planks being &s;upported by &s;tanchions, are &s;ewed or clamped together with &s;trong thongs of plaiting, which are pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal times through holes that are bored with a gouge or auger of bone, that has been de&s;cribed already, and the nicety with which this is done, may be inferred from their being &s;ufficiently water-tight for u&s;e without caulking. As the plaiting &s;oon rots in the water, it is renewed at lea&s;t once a year; in order to which the ve&s;&s;el is taken entirely to pieces. The head and &s;tern are rude with re&s;pect to the de&s;ign; but very neatly fini&s;hed, and poli&s;hed to the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The&s;e Pahies are kept with the greate&s;t care, in a kind of a hou&s;e built on purpo&s;e for their reception; the hou&s;es are formed of poles &s;et upright in the ground, the tops of which are drawn towards each other, and fa&s;tened together with their &s;tronge&s;t cords, &s;o as to form a kind of Gothick arch, which is completely thatched quite to the ground, being open only at the ends; they are &s;ometimes fifty or &s;ixty paces long.</P>
<P>As connected with the navigation of the&s;e people, I &s;hall mention their wonderful &s;agacity in foretelling the weather, at lea&s;t the quarter from which the wind &s;hall blow at a future time; they have &s;everal ways of doing this, of which however I know but one. They &s;ay that the milky-way is always curved laterally; but &s;ometimes in one direction, and &s;ome|times in another: and that this curvature is the effect of its being already acted upon by the wind, and its hollow part therefore towards it; &s;o that if the &s;ame curvature continues a night, a corre&s;ponding wind certainly blows the next day. Of their rules, I &s;hall not pretend to judge; but I know, that
<PB N="142" REF="013324_0169_0F90F0BF7B3885C0">
by whatever means, they can predict the weather, at lea&s;t the wind, with much greater certainty than we can.</P>
<P>In their longer voyages, they &s;teer by the &s;un in the day, and in the night by the &s;tars; all of which they di&s;tingui&s;h &s;eparately by names, and know in what part of the heavens they will appear in any of the months during which they are vi&s;ible in their horizon; they al&s;o know the time of their an|nual appearing and di&s;appearing with more preci&s;ion than will ea&s;ily be believed by an European a&s;tronomer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. Of the Divi&s;ion of Time in Otaheite; Numeration, Computation of Di&s;tance, Language, Di&s;ea&s;es, Di&s;po&s;al of the Dead, Religion, War, Weapons, and Government; with &s;ome general Ob&s;erva|tions for the U&s;e of future Navigators.</HEAD>
<P>WE were not able to acquire a perfect idea of their method of dividing time; but ob&s;erved, that in &s;peaking of it, either pa&s;t or to come, they never u&s;ed any term but <HI>Mala|ma,</HI> which &s;ignifies moon. Of the&s;e moons they count thirteen, and then begin again; which is a demon&s;tration that they have a notion of the &s;olar year: but how they compute their months &s;o that thirteen of them &s;hall be commen&s;urate with the year, we could not di&s;cover; for they &s;ay that each month has twenty-nine days, including one in which the moon is not vi&s;ible. They have names for them &s;eparately, and have frequently told us the fruits that would be in &s;ea&s;on, and the weather that would prevail, in each of them; and they have indeed a name for them collectively, though they u&s;e it only when they &s;peak of the my&s;teries of their religion.</P>
<P>Every day is &s;ubdivided into 12 parts, each of 2 hours, of which 6 belong to the day, and 6 to the night. At the&s;e di|vi&s;ions they gue&s;s pretty nearly by the height of the &s;un while he is above the horizon; but there are few of them that can gue&s;s at them, when he is below it, by the &s;tars.</P>
<P>In numeration they proceed from one to ten, the number of fingers on both hands; and though they have for each number a different name, they generally take hold of their fingers one by one, &s;hifting from one hand to the other till they come to the number they want to expre&s;s. And in other in&s;tances, we ob&s;erved that, when they were conver&s;ing with each other, they joined &s;igns to their words, which were &s;o expre&s;&s;ive that a &s;tranger might ea&s;ily apprehend their meaning.</P>
<P>In counting from ten they repeat the name of that number, and add the word <HI>more;</HI> ten, and one more, is eleven; ten, and
<PB N="143" REF="013324_0170_0F904D2E59258000">
two more twelve; and &s;o of the re&s;t, as we &s;ay one and twenty, two and twenty. When they come to ten and ten more, they have a new denomination, as we &s;ay a &s;core; and by the&s;e &s;cores they count till they get ten of them, when they have a denomination for two hundred; and we never could di&s;cover that they had any denomination to expre&s;s a greater number neither, indeed, do they &s;eem to want any; for ten of the&s;e amount to 2000, a greater number than they can ever apply.</P>
<P>In mea&s;uring di&s;tance they are much more deficient than in computing numbers, having but one term which an&s;wers to fathom; when they &s;peak of di&s;tances from place to place, they expre&s;s it, like the A&s;iaticks, by the time that is required to pa&s;s it.</P>
<P>Their language is &s;oft and melodious; it abounds with vowels, and we ea&s;ily lear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t to pronounce it; but found it ex|ceedingly difficult to teach them to pronounce a &s;ingle word of ours; probably not only from its abounding in con&s;onants, but from &s;ome peculiarity in its &s;tructure; for Spani&s;h and Italian words, if ending in a vowel, they pronounced with great facility.</P>
<P>Whether it is copious, we were not &s;ufficiently acquainted with it to know; but it is certainly very imperfect, for it is almo&s;t totally without inflexion, both of nouns and verbs. Few of the nouns have more than one ca&s;e, and few of the verbs more than one ten&s;e; yet we find no great difficulty in making our&s;elves mutually under&s;tood, however &s;trange it may appear in &s;peculation.</P>
<P>They have, however, certain <HI>affixa,</HI> which, though but few in number, are very u&s;eful to them, and puzzled us extremely. One a&s;ks another, <HI>Harre hea?</HI> "Where are you going?" the other an&s;wers <HI>Ivahinera,</HI> "To my wives;" upon which the fir&s;t repeating interrogatively, "To your wives?" is an&s;wered, <HI>Ivahinereira:</HI> "Yes, I am going to my wives." Here the &s;uf|fixa <HI>era</HI> and <HI>eira</HI> &s;ave &s;everal words to both parties.</P>
<P>I have in&s;erted a few of their words, from which perhaps &s;ome idea may be formed of the language.</P>

<P>Among people who&s;e food is &s;o &s;imple, and who in general are &s;eldom drunk, it is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that there are but few di&s;ea&s;es; we &s;aw no critical di&s;ea&s;e during our &s;tay upon the i&s;land, and but few in&s;tances of &s;ickne&s;s, which were accidental fits of the colic. The natives, however, are afflicted with the ery&s;ipelas, and cutaneous eruptions of the &s;caly kind, very nearly approaching to a lepro&s;y. Tho&s;e in whom this di&s;temper was far advanced, lived in a &s;tate of &s;e|clu&s;ion from all &s;ociety, each in a &s;mall hou&s;e built upon &s;ome unfrequented &s;pot, where they were &s;upplied with provi&s;ions: but whether they had any hope of relief, or langui&s;hed out the remainder of their lives in &s;olitude and de&s;pair, we could not learn. We ob&s;erved al&s;o a few who had ulcers upon dif|ferent parts of their bodies, &s;ome of which had a very virulent
<PB N="145" REF="013324_0172_0F90F0C0A73389A8">
appearance; yet they &s;eemed not much to be regarded by tho&s;e who were afflicted with them, for they were left intirely without application, even to keep off the flies.</P>
<P>Where intemperance produces no di&s;ea&s;es, there will be no phy&s;icians by profe&s;&s;ion; yet where there is &s;ufferance, there will always be attempts to relieve; and where the cau&s;e of the mi&s;chief and the remedy are alike unknown, the&s;e will natu|rally be directed by &s;uper&s;tition: thus it happens, that in this country, and in all others which are not further injured by luxury, or improved by knowledge, the management of the &s;ick falls to the lot of the prie&s;t. The method of cure that is practi&s;ed by the prie&s;ts of Otaheite, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of prayers and ceremonies. When he vi&s;its his patient he repeats certain &s;entences, which appear to be &s;et forms contrived for the oc|ca&s;ion, and at the &s;ame time plaits the leaves of the cocoa|nut into different figures very neatly; &s;ome of the&s;e he fa&s;tens to the fingers and toes of the &s;ick, and often leaves behind him a few branches of the <HI>the &s;pecia populnea,</HI> which they call <HI>E'mid|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o:</HI> the&s;e ceremonies are repeated till the patient recovers or dies. If he recovers, they &s;ay the remedies cured him, if he dies, they &s;ay the di&s;ea&s;e was incurable, in which, perhaps, they do not much differ from the cu&s;tom of other countries.</P>
<P>If we had judged of their &s;kill in &s;urgery from the dreadful &s;cars which we &s;ometimes &s;aw, we &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed it to be much &s;uperior to the art not only of their phy&s;icians, but of ours. We &s;aw one man who&s;e face was almo&s;t intirely de&s;troyed, his no&s;e, including the bone, was perfectly flat, and one cheek and one eye were &s;o beaten in, that the hollow would almo&s;t receive a man's fi&s;t, yet no ulcer remained; and our companion, Tupia, had been pierced quite through his body by a &s;pear, headed with the bone of a &s;ting-ray, the weapon having entered his back, and come out ju&s;t under his brea&s;t; but except in reducing di&s;locations and fractures, the be&s;t &s;urgeon can contribute very little to the cure of a wound; the blood it&s;elf is the be&s;t vulnerary bal&s;am, and when the juices of the body are pure, and the patient is temperate, no|thing more is nece&s;&s;ary, as an aid to nature, in the cure of the wor&s;t wound, than the keeping it clean.</P>
<P>Their commerce with the inhabitants of Europe has, how|ever, already entailed upon them that dreadful cur&s;e which avenged the inhumanities committed by the Spaniards in America, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e. As it is certain that no Euro|pean ve&s;&s;el be&s;ides our own, except the Dolphin, and the two that were under the command of Mon&s;. Bougainville, ever vi&s;ited this i&s;land, it mu&s;t have been brought either by one of them or by us. That it was not brought by the Dolphin, Captain Wallis has demon&s;trated in the account of her voyage, and nothing is more certain than that
<PB N="146" REF="013324_0173_0F90F0C2600DE6F0">
when we arrived it had made mo&s;t dreadful ravages in the i&s;land. One of our people contracted it within five days after we went on &s;hore, and by the enquiries among the natives, which this occa&s;ioned, we learnt, when we came to under|&s;tand a little of their language, that it had been brought by the ve&s;&s;els which had been there about fifteen months before us, and had lain on the ea&s;t-&s;ide of the i&s;land. They di&s;|tingui&s;hed it by a name of the &s;ame import with <HI>rottenne&s;s,</HI> but of a more exten&s;ive &s;ignification, and de&s;cribed in the mo&s;t pathetic terms, the &s;ufferings of the fir&s;t victims to its rage, and told us that it cau&s;ed the hair and the nails to fall off, and the fle&s;h to rot from the bones: that it &s;pread a uni|ver&s;al terror and con&s;ternation among them, &s;o that the &s;ick were abandoned by their neare&s;t relations, le&s;t the calamity &s;hould &s;pread by contagion, and left to peri&s;h alone in &s;uch mi&s;ery as till then had never been known among them. We had &s;ome rea&s;on, however, to hope that they had found out a &s;pecific to cure it: during our &s;tay upon the i&s;land we &s;aw none in whom it had made a great progre&s;s, and one who went from us infected, returned after a &s;hort time in perfect health; and by this it appeared either that the di&s;ea&s;e had cured it&s;elf, or that they were not unacquainted with the virtues of &s;imples, nor implicit dupes to the &s;uper&s;titious follies of their prie&s;ts. We endeavoured to learn the medical qualities which they imputed to their plants, but our knowledge of their language was too imperfect for us to &s;ucceed. If we could have learnt their &s;pecific for the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, if &s;uch they have, it would have been of great advantage to us, for when we left the i&s;land it had been contracted by more than half the people on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible but that, in relating incidents, many parti|culars with re&s;pect to the cu&s;toms, opinions, and works of the&s;e people &s;hould be anticipated; to avoid repetition, there|fore I &s;hall only &s;upply deficiencies. Of the manner of di&s;|po&s;ing of their dead, much has been &s;aid already. I mu&s;t more explicitly ob&s;erve that there are two places in which the dead are depo&s;ited; one a kind of &s;hed, where the fle&s;h is &s;uffered to putrefy; the other an enclo&s;ure, with erections of &s;tone, where the bones are afterwards buried. The &s;heds are called TUPAPOW, and the enclo&s;ures Morai. The Morais are al&s;o places of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a native of Otaheite is known to be dead, the hou&s;e is filled with relations, who deplore their lo&s;s, &s;ome by loud lamentations, and &s;ome by le&s;s clamorous, but more ge|nuine expre&s;&s;ions of grief. Tho&s;e who are in the neare&s;t de|gree of kindred, and are really affected by the event, are &s;i|lent; the re&s;t are one moment uttering pa&s;&s;ionate exclama|tions in a chorus, and the next laughing and talking without
<PB N="147" REF="013324_0174_0F8FF5310CEC9030">
the lea&s;t appearance of concern. In this manner the remainder of the day on which they a&s;&s;emble is &s;pent, and all the &s;uc|ceeding night. On the next morning the body is &s;hrouded in their cloth, and conveyed to the &s;ea &s;ide upon a bier, which the bearers &s;upport upon their &s;houlders, attended by the prie&s;t, who, having prayed over the body, repeats his &s;en|tences during the proce&s;&s;ion: when it arrives at the water's edge, it is &s;et down upon the beach; the prie&s;t renews his prayers, and taking up &s;ome of the water in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is hands, &s;prink|les it towards the body, but not upon it. It is then carried back forty or fifty yards, and &s;oon after brought again to the beach, where the prayers and &s;prinkling are repeated: it is thus removed backwards and forwards &s;everal times, and while the&s;e ceremonies have been performing a hou&s;e has been built, and a &s;mall &s;pace of ground railed in. In the center of this hou&s;e, or Tupapow, po&s;ts are &s;et up to &s;upport the bier, which is at length conveyed thither, and placed upon it, and here the body remains to putrify, till the fle&s;h is wholly wa&s;ted from the bones.</P>
<P>The&s;e hou&s;es of corruption are of a &s;ize proportioned to the rank of the per&s;on who&s;e body they are to contain; tho&s;e al|lotted to the lower cla&s;s are ju&s;t &s;ufficient to cover the bier, and have no railing round them. The large&s;t we ever &s;aw was eleven yards long, and &s;uch as the&s;e are ornamented according to the abilities and inclination of the &s;urviving kindred, who never fail to lay a profu&s;ion of good cloth about the body, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t cover the out&s;ide of the hou&s;e. Garlands of the fruit of the palm-nut or <HI>pandanus,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d cocoa leaves, twi&s;ted by the prie&s;ts in my&s;terious knots, with a plant called by them <HI>Ethee no Morai,</HI> which is particularly con&s;ecrated to funeral &s;olemnities, are depo&s;ited about the place; provi&s;ion and wa|ter are al&s;o left at a little di&s;tance, of which, and of other decorations, a more particular de&s;cription has been given al|ready.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the body is depo&s;ited in the Tupapow, the mourning is renewed. The women a&s;&s;emble, and are led to the door by the neare&s;t relation, who &s;trikes a &s;hark's tooth &s;everal times in the crown of her head: the blood copiou&s;ly follows, and is carefully received upon pieces of linen, which are thrown under the bier. The re&s;t of the women follow this example, and the ceremony is repeated at the interval of two or three days, as long as the zeal and &s;orrow of the parties hold out. The tears al&s;o which are &s;hed upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, are received upon pieces of cloth, and offered as oblations to the dead: &s;ome of the younger people cut off their hair, and that is thrown under the bier with the other offerings. This cu&s;tom is founded upon a notion that the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed, which they believe to exi&s;t in a &s;eparate &s;tate, is hovering
<PB N="148" REF="013324_0175_0F8FF531800C0238">
the place where the body is depo&s;ited: that it ob&s;erves the ac|tions of the &s;urvivors, and is gratified by &s;uch te&s;timonies of their affection and grief.</P>
<P>Two or three days after the&s;e ceremonies have been com|menced by the women, during which the men &s;eem to be wholly in&s;en&s;ible of their lo&s;s, they al&s;o begin to perform their part. The neare&s;t relations take it in turn to a&s;&s;ume the dre&s;s, and perform the office which have already been particularly de&s;cribed in the account of Tubourai Tamaide's having acted as chief mourner to an old women, his relation, who died while we were in the i&s;land. One part of the ceremony, however, which accounts for the running away of the people as &s;oon as this proce&s;&s;ion is in &s;ight, has not been mentioned. The chief mourner carries in his hand a long flat &s;tick, the edge of which is &s;et with &s;hark's teeth, and in a phrenzy, which his grief is &s;uppo&s;ed to have in&s;pired, he runs at all he &s;ees, and if any of them happen to be overtaken, he &s;trikes them mo&s;t unmercifully with this intended cudgel, which can|not fail to wound them in a dangerous manner.</P>
<P>The&s;e proce&s;&s;ions continue at certain intervals for five moons, but are le&s;s and le&s;s frequent, by a gradual diminu|tion, as the end of that time approaches. When it is expired, what remains of the body is taken down from the bier, and the bones having been &s;craped and wa&s;hed very clean, are buried, according to the rank of the per&s;on, either within or without a Morai: if the decea&s;ed was a Earee, or Chief, his &s;kull is not buried with the re&s;t of the bones, but is wrapped up in fine cloth, and put in a kind of box made for that pur|po&s;e, which is al&s;o placed in the Morai. This coffer is called <HI>Ewharre no te Orometua,</HI> the hou&s;e of a teacher or ma&s;ter. After this the mourning cea&s;es, except &s;ome of the women continue to be really afflicted for the lo&s;s, and in that ca&s;e they will &s;ometimes &s;uddenly wound them&s;elves with the &s;hark's tooth wherever they happen to be: this perhaps will account for the pa&s;&s;ion of grief in which Terapo wounded her|&s;elf at the fort; &s;ome accidental circum&s;tance might forcibly revive the remembrance of a friend or relation whom &s;he had lo&s;t, with a pungency of regret and tenderne&s;s, which forced a vent by tears, and prompted her to a repetition of the fune|ral rite.</P>
<P>The ceremonies, however, do not cea&s;e with the mourning: prayers are &s;till &s;aid by the prie&s;t, who is well paid by the &s;ur|viving relations, and offerings made at the Morai. Some of the things, which from time to time are depo&s;ited there, are emblematical: a young plantain repre&s;ents the decea&s;ed, and the bunch of feathers the deity who is invoked. The prie&s;t places him&s;elf over-again&s;t the &s;ymbol of the God, accompa|nied by &s;ome of the relations, who are furni&s;hed with a &s;mall
<PB N="149" REF="013324_0176_0F8FF5323B87F998">
offering, and repeats his orai&s;on in a &s;et form, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eparate &s;entences; at the &s;ame time weaving the leaves of the cocoa-nut into different forms, which he afterwards depo&s;its upon the ground where the bones have been interred; the dei|ty is then addre&s;&s;ed by a &s;hrill &s;creech, which is u&s;ed only upon that occa&s;ion. When the prie&s;t retires, the tuft of fea|thers is removed, and the provi&s;ions left to putrify, or be de|voured by the rats.</P>
<P>Of the religion of the&s;e people, we were not able to ac|quire any clear and con&s;i&s;tent knowledge: we found it like the religion of mo&s;t other countries, involved in my&s;tery, and perplexed with apparent incon&s;i&s;tencies. The religious lan|guage is al&s;o here, as it is in China, different from that which is u&s;ed in common; &s;o that Tupia, who took great pains to in&s;truct us, having no words to expre&s;s his meaning which we under&s;tood, gave us lectures to very little purpo&s;e: what we learnt, however, I will relate with as much per&s;picuity as I can.</P>
<P>Nothing is more obvious to a rational being, however ig|norant or &s;tupid, than that the univer&s;e and its various parts, as far as they fall under his notice, were produced by &s;ome agent inconceivably more powerful than him&s;elf; and nothing is more difficult to be conceived, even by the mo&s;t &s;agacious and knowing, than the production of them from nothing, which among us is expre&s;&s;ed by the word <HI>Creation.</HI> It is na|tural therefore, as no Being apparently capable of producing the univer&s;e is to be &s;een, that he &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to re|&s;ide in &s;ome di&s;tant part of it, or to be in his nature invi&s;ible, and that he &s;hould have originally produced all that now ex|i&s;ts in a manner &s;imilar to that in which nature is renovated by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of one generation to another; but the idea of procreation includes in it that of two per&s;ons, and from the conjunction of two per&s;ons the&s;e people imagine every thing in the univer&s;e either originally or derivatively to proceed.</P>
<P>The Supreme Deity, one of the&s;e two fir&s;t beings, they call TAROATAIHETOOMOO, and the other, whom they &s;up|po&s;e to have been a rock, TEPAPA. A daughter of the&s;e was TETTOWMATATAYO, the year, or thirteen months collec|tively, which they never name but upon this occa&s;ion, and &s;he, by the common father, produced the months, and the months, by conjunction with each other, the days: the &s;tars they &s;up|po&s;e partly to be the immediate offspring of the fir&s;t pair, and partly to have increa&s;ed among them&s;elves; and they have the &s;ame notion with re&s;pect to the different &s;pecies of plants. Among other progeny of Taroataihetoomoo and Tepapa, they &s;uppo&s;e an inferior race of deities whom they call EATUAS. Two of the&s;e Eatuas, they &s;ay, at &s;ome remote period of time, inhabited the earth, and were the parents of the fir&s;t man.
<PB N="150" REF="013324_0177_0F8FF53480E3CC68">
When this man, their common ance&s;tor, was born, they &s;ay that he was round like a ball, but that his mother, with great care, drew out his limbs, and having at length moulded him into his pre&s;ent form, &s;he called him EOTHE, which &s;ignifies <HI>fini&s;hed.</HI> That being prompted by the univer&s;al in&s;tinct to pro|pagate his kind, and being able to find no female but his mother, he begot upon her a daughter, and upon the daugh|ter other daughters for &s;everal generations, before there was a &s;on; a &s;on, however, being at length born, he, by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of his &s;i&s;ters, peopled the world.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their daughter Tettowmatatayo, the fir&s;t progeni|tors of nature had a &s;on whom they called TANE. Taroatai|hetoomoo, the Supreme Deity, they emphatically &s;tile the cau&s;er of earthquakes; but their prayers are more generally addre&s;&s;ed to Tane, whom they &s;uppo&s;e to take a greater part in the affairs of mankind.</P>
<P>Their &s;ubordinate deities or Eatuas, which are numerous, are of both &s;exes: the male are wor&s;hipped by the men, and the female by the women; and each have Morais to which the other &s;ex is not admitted, though they have al&s;o Morais common to both. Men perform the office of prie&s;t to both &s;exes, but each &s;ex has its prie&s;ts, for tho&s;e who officiate for one &s;ex, do not officiate for the other.</P>
<P>They believe the immortality of the &s;oul, at lea&s;t its exi&s;|tence in a &s;eparate &s;tate, and that there are two &s;ituations of different degrees of happine&s;s, &s;omewhat analogous to our heaven and hell: the &s;uperior &s;ituation they call <HI>Tavirua l'e|rai,</HI> the other <HI>Tiahoboo.</HI> They do not, however, con&s;ider them as places of reward and puni&s;hment, but as receptacles for dif|ferent cla&s;&s;es; the fir&s;t, for their Chiefs and principal people, the other for tho&s;e of inferior rank, for they do not &s;uppo&s;e that their actions here in the lea&s;t influence their future &s;tate, or indeed that they come under the cognizance of their deities at all. Their religion, therefore, if it has no influence upon their morals, is at lea&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted; and their expre&s;&s;ions of adoration and reverence, whether by words or actions, ari&s;e only from a humble &s;en&s;e of their own inferiority, and the ineffable excellence of divine perfection.</P>
<P>The character of the prie&s;t of Tahowa, is hereditary: the cla&s;s is numerous, and con&s;i&s;ts of all ranks of people; the chief, however, is generally the younger brother of a good fa|mily, and is re&s;pected in a degree next to their kings. Of the little knowledge that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in this country, the prie&s;ts have the greate&s;t &s;hare; but it con&s;i&s;ts principally in an acquaintance with the names and ranks of the different Eatuas, or &s;ubordinate divinities, and the opinions concern|ing the origin of things, which have been traditionally pre|&s;erved among the order in detached &s;entences, of which &s;ome
<PB N="151" REF="013324_0178_0F8FFA00B966CB30">
will repeat an incredible number, though but very few of the words that are u&s;ed in their common dialect occur in them.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts, however, are &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the people in the knowledge of navigation and a&s;tronomy, and indeed the name Tahowa &s;ignifies nothing more than a man of knowlege. As there are prie&s;ts of every cla&s;s, they officiate only among that cla&s;s to which they belong: the prie&s;t of the inferior cla&s;s is never called upon by tho&s;e of &s;uperior rank, nor will the prie&s;t of the &s;uperior rank officiate for any of the inferior cla&s;s.</P>
<P>Marriage in this i&s;land, as appeared to us, is nothing more than an agreement between the man and woman, with which the prie&s;t has no concern. Where it is contracted it appears to be pretty well kept, though &s;ometimes the parties &s;eparate by mutual con&s;ent, and in that ca&s;e a divorce takes place with as little trouble as the marriage.</P>
<P>But though the prie&s;thood has laid the people under no tax for a nuptial benediction, there are two operations which it has appropriated, and from which it derives con&s;iderable advan|tages. One is <HI>tattowing,</HI> and the other circumci&s;ion, though neither of them have any connexion with religion. The tat|towing has been de&s;cribed already. Circumci&s;ion has been adopted merely from motives of cleanline&s;s; it cannot indeed properly be called circumci&s;ion, becau&s;e the <HI>prepuce</HI> is not mu|tilated by a circular wound, but only &s;lit through the upper part to prevent its contracting over the <HI>glans.</HI> As neither of the&s;e can be performed by any but a prie&s;t, and as to be without either is the greate&s;t di&s;grace, they may be con&s;idered as a claim to &s;urplice fees like our marriages and chri&s;tenings, which are cheerfully and liberally paid, not according to any &s;ettled &s;tipend, but the rank and abilities of the parties or their friends.</P>
<P>The Morai, as has already been ob&s;erved, is at once a burying ground and a place of wor&s;hip, and in this particular our churches too much re&s;emble it. The Indian, however, ap|proaches his Morai with a reverence and humility that di&s;graces the chri&s;tian, not becau&s;e he holds any thing &s;acred that is there, but becau&s;e he there wor&s;hips an invi&s;ible divinity, for whom, though he neither hopes for reward, nor fears puni&s;h|ment, at his hand, he always expre&s;&s;es the profounde&s;t homage, and mo&s;t humble adoration. I have already given a very par|ticular de&s;cription both of the Morais and the altars that are placed near them. When an Indian is about to wor&s;hip at the Morai, or brings his offering to the altar, he always uncovers his body to the wa&s;te, and his looks and attitude are &s;uch as &s;ufficiently expre&s;s a corre&s;ponding di&s;po&s;ition of mind.</P>
<P>It did not appear to us that the&s;e people are, in any in&s;tance guilty of idolatry; at lea&s;t they do not wor&s;hip any thing that is the work of their hands, nor any vi&s;ible part of the creation.
<PB N="152" REF="013324_0179_0F8FFA0113A3DCD0">
This i&s;land indeed, and the re&s;t that lie near it, have a parti|cular bird, &s;ome a heron, and others a king's fi&s;her, to which they pay a peculiar regard, and concerning which they have &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious notions with re&s;pect to good and bad fortune, as we have of the &s;wallow and robin-red-brea&s;t, given them the name of EATUA, and by no means killing or mole&s;ting them; or approach them with any act of adoration.</P>
<P>Though I dare not a&s;&s;ert that the&s;e people, to whom the art of writing, and con&s;equently the recording of laws, are utterly unknown, live under a regular form of government; yet a &s;ubordination is e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, that greatly re&s;embles the early &s;tate of every nation in Europe under the feudal &s;y&s;tem, which &s;ecured liberty in the mo&s;t licentious exce&s;s to a few, and entailed the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery upon the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Their orders are, <HI>Earee rahie,</HI> which an&s;wers to king; <HI>Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> baron; <HI>Manahouni,</HI> va&s;&s;al; and <HI>Tout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> villain. The Earee rahie, of which there are two in this i&s;land, one being the &s;o|vereign of each of the penin&s;ulas of which it con&s;i&s;ts, is treated with great re&s;pect by all ranks, but did not appear to us to be inve&s;ted with &s;o much power as was exerci&s;ed by the Earees in their own di&s;tricts; nor indeed did we, as I have before ob|&s;erved, once &s;ee the &s;overeign of Obereonoo, while we were in the i&s;land. The Earees are lords of one or more of the di&s;tricts into which each of the penin&s;ulas is divided, of which there may be about one hundred in the whole i&s;land; and they par|cel out their territories to the Manohounies, who cultivate each his part which he holds under the baron. The lowe&s;t cla&s;s, called Toutous, &s;eem to be nearly under the &s;ame circum&s;tances as the villains in feudal governments; the&s;e do all the laborious work, they cultivate the land under the Manahounies, who are only nominal cultivators for the lord, they fetch wood and water, and under the direction of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family, dre&s;s the victuals, they al&s;o catch the fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Each of the Earees keeps a kind of court, and has a great number of attendants, chiefly the younger brothers of their own tribe; and among the&s;e &s;ome hold particular offices, but of what nature exactly we could not tell. One was called the <HI>Eowa no l'Earee,</HI> and another the <HI>Whanno no l'Earee,</HI> and the&s;e were frequently di&s;patched to us with me&s;&s;ages. Of all the courts of the&s;e Earees, that of Tootahah was the mo&s;t &s;plendid, as indeed might rea&s;onably be expected, becau&s;e he admini|&s;tered the government for Outou, his nephew, who, was Earee rahie of Obereonoo, and lived upon his e&s;tate. The child of the baron or Earee, as well as of the &s;overeign or Earee rahie, &s;uc|ceeds to the title and honours of the father as &s;oon as it is born: &s;o that a baron, who was ye&s;terday called Earee, and was ap|proached with the ceremony of lowering the garments, &s;o as to uncover the upper part of the body, is to-day, if his wife was
<PB N="153" REF="013324_0180_0F90F0C2865BEE00">
la&s;t night delivered of a child, reduced to the rank of a private man, all marks of re&s;pect being transferred to the child, if it is &s;uffered to live, though the father &s;till continues po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or and admini&s;trator of his e&s;tate: probably this cu&s;tom has its &s;hare, among other inducements, in forming the &s;ocieties called Arreoy.</P>
<P>If a general attack happens to be made upon the i&s;land, every di&s;trict under the command of an Earee, is obliged to furni&s;h its proportion of &s;oldiers for the common defence. The number furni&s;hed by the principal di&s;tricts, which Tupia recollected, when added together, amounted, as I have ob&s;erved before, to &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and eighty.</P>
<P>Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, the united force of the whole i&s;land is commanded in chief by the Earee rahie. Private differences be|tween two Earees, are decided by their own people, without at all di&s;turbing the general tranquility.</P>
<P>Their weapons are &s;lings, which they u&s;e with great dex|terity, pikes headed with the &s;tings of &s;ting-rays, and clubs, of about &s;ix or &s;even feet long, made of a very hard heavy wood. Thus armed, they are &s;aid to fight with great ob&s;tinacy, which is the more likely to be true, as it is certain that they give no quarter either to man, woman, or child, who is &s;o unfortunate as to fall into their hands during the battle, or for &s;ome hours afterwards, till their pa&s;&s;ion, which is always violent, though not la&s;ting, has &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>The Earee rahie of Obereonoo, while we were here, was in perfect amity with the Earee rahie of Tiarreboo, the other penin|&s;ula, though he took him&s;elf the title of king of the whole i&s;land; this, however, produced no more jealou&s;y in the other &s;overeign, than the title of king of France, a&s;&s;umed by our &s;overeign, does in his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In a government &s;o rude, it cannot be expected that di&s;tribu|tive ju&s;tice &s;hould be regularly admini&s;tered, and indeed where there is &s;o little oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, in con&s;equence of the facility with which every appetite and pa&s;&s;ion is gratified, there can be but few crimes. There is nothing like money, the common medium by which every want and every wi&s;h is &s;up|po&s;ed to be gratified by tho&s;e who do not po&s;&s;e&s;s it; there is no apparently permanent good which either fraud or force can unlawfully obtain; and when all the crimes that are committed by the inhabitants of civilized countries, to get money, are &s;et out of the account, not many will remain; add to this, that where the commerce with woman is re&s;trained by no law, men will &s;eldom be under any temptation to commit adultery, e&s;pe|cially as one woman is always le&s;s preferred to another, where they are le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by per&s;onal decorations, and the ad|ventitious circum&s;tances which are produced by the varieties of art, and the refinements of &s;entiment. That they are thieves
<PB N="154" REF="013324_0181_0F90F0C7D66EEB80">
is true; but as among the&s;e people no man can be much injured or benefited by theft, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train it by &s;uch puni&s;hments, as in other countries are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the very exi&s;tence of civil &s;ociety. Tupia, however, tells us, that adultery is &s;ometimes committed as well as theft. In all ca&s;es where an injury has been committed, the puni&s;hment of the offender lies with the &s;ufferer: adulery, if the parties are caught in the fact, is &s;ometimes puni&s;hed with death in the fir&s;t ardour of re&s;entment; but without circum&s;tances of imme|diate provocation, the female &s;inner &s;eldom &s;uffers more than a beating. As puni&s;hment, however, is enforced by no law, nor taken into the hand of any magi&s;trate, it is not often in|flicted, except the injured party is the &s;tronge&s;t; though the chiefs do &s;ometimes puni&s;h their immediate dependants, for faults committed again&s;t each other, and even the dependents of others if they are accu&s;ed of any offence committed in their di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Having now given the be&s;t de&s;cription that I can of the i&s;land in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, and of the people, with their cu&s;toms and manners, language and arts, I &s;hall only add a few gene|ral ob&s;ervations, which may be of u&s;e to future navigators, if any of the &s;hips of Great-Britain &s;hould receive orders to vi&s;it it. As it produces nothing that appears to be convertible into an article of trade, and can be u&s;eful only by affording refre&s;h|ments to &s;hipping in their pa&s;&s;age through the&s;e &s;eas, it might be made to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e in a much greater degree, by tran&s;porting thither &s;heep, goats, and horned cattle, with European garden &s;tuff, and other u&s;eful vegetables, which there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e will flouri&s;h in &s;o fine a climate and &s;o rich a &s;oil.</P>
<P>Though this, and the neighbouring i&s;lands lie within the tropic of Capricorn, yet the heat is not trouble&s;ome, nor did the winds blow con&s;tantly from the ea&s;t. We had frequently a fre&s;h gale from the S. W. for two or three days, and &s;ometimes, though very &s;eldom, from the N. W. Tupia reported, that &s;outh we&s;terly winds prevail in October, November, and De|cember, and we have no doubt of the fact. When the winds are variable, they are always accompanied by a &s;well from the S. W. or W. S. W. there is al&s;o a &s;well from the &s;ame points when it is calm, and the atmo&s;phere loaded with clouds, which is a &s;ure indication that the winds are variable, or we&s;terly out at &s;ea, for with the &s;ettled trade wind the weather is clear.</P>
<P>The meeting with we&s;terly winds, within the general limits of the ea&s;tern trade, has induced &s;ome navigators to &s;uppo&s;e that they were near &s;ome large tract of land, of which, how|ever, I think they are no indication.</P>
<P>It has been found, both by us and the Dolphin, that the trade-wind, in the&s;e parts, does not extend farther to the &s;outh
<PB N="155" REF="013324_0182_0F8FFA01D09D6EE8">
than twenty degrees, beyond which, we generally found a gale from the we&s;tward; and it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that when the&s;e winds blow &s;trong, they will drive back the ea&s;terly wind, and con&s;equently encroach upon the limits within which they con&s;tantly blow, and thus nece&s;&s;arily produce variable winds, as either happens to prevail, and a &s;outh we&s;terly &s;well. This &s;uppo&s;ition is the more probable, as it is well known that the trade winds blow but faintly for &s;ome di&s;tance within their limits, and therefore may be more ea&s;ily &s;topped or repelled by a wind in the contrary direction; it is al&s;o well known, that the limits of the trade winds vary not only at different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, but &s;ometimes at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, in different years.</P>
<P>There is therefore no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;outh we&s;terly winds, within the&s;e limits, are cau&s;ed by the vicinity of large tracts of land, e&s;pecially as they are always accompanied with a large &s;well, in the &s;ame direction in which they blow; and we find a much greater &s;urf beating upon the &s;hores of the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;lands that are &s;ituated ju&s;t within the limits of the trade wind, than upon any other part of them.</P>
<P>The tides about the&s;e i&s;lands, are perhaps as incon&s;iderable as in any part of the world. A &s;outh or S. by W. moon, makes high water in the bay of Matavia at Otaheite; but the water very &s;eldom ri&s;es perpendicularly above ten or twelve inches.</P>
<P>The variation of the compa&s;s, I found to be 4&deg; 46&prime; ea&s;terly, this being the re&s;ult of a great number of trials made with four of Dr. Knight's needles, adapted to azimuth compa&s;&s;es. The&s;e compa&s;&s;es I thought the be&s;t that could be procured, yet, when applied to the meridian line, I found them to differ not only from one another, &s;ometimes a degree and a half, but the &s;ame needle, half a degree from it&s;elf in different trials made on the &s;ame day; and I do not remember that I have ever found two needles which exactly agreed at the &s;ame time and place, though I have often found the &s;ame needle agree with it&s;elf, in &s;everal trials made one after the other. This imper|fection of the needle, however, is of no con&s;equence to navi|gation, as the variation can always be found to a degree of ac|curacy, more than &s;ufficient for all nautical purpo&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. A De&s;cription of &s;everal other I&s;lands in the Neighbourhood of Otaheite, with various Incidents; a dramatic Entertainment; and many particulars relative to the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER parting with our friends, we made an ea&s;y &s;ail, with gentle breezes and clear weather, and were in|formed by Tupia, that four of the neighbouring i&s;lands, which he di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of HUAHEINE, ULIETEA, OTAHA, and BOLABOLA, lay at the di&s;tance of between one and two days &s;ail from Otaheite; and that hogs, fowls and other refre&s;hments, with which we of late had been but &s;pa|ringly &s;upplied, were there to be procured in great plenty; but having di&s;covered from the hills of Otaheite, an i&s;land lying to the northward, which he called TETHUROA, I deter|mined fir&s;t to &s;tand that way, to take a nearer view of it. It lies N. half W. di&s;tant eight leagues from the northern extremity of Otaheite, upon which we had ob&s;erved the tran&s;it, and to which we had, for that rea&s;on, given the name of POINT VE|NUS. We found it to be a &s;mall low i&s;land, and were told by Tupia, that it had no &s;ettled inhabitants, but was occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited by the inhabitants of Otaheite, who &s;ometimes went thither for a few days to fi&s;h: we therefore determined to &s;pend no more time in a farther examination of it, but to go in &s;earch of Huaheine and Ulietea, which he de&s;cribed to be well peo|pled, and as large as Otaheite.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning of the 14th, the we&s;termo&s;t part of EIMEO, or York i&s;land, bore S. E. &frac12; S. and the body of Otaheite E. &frac12; S. At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">noon, the body of York i&s;land bore E. by S. &frac12; S. and Port Royal bay, at Otaheite, S. 70&deg; 45&prime; E. di&s;tant 61 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and an i&s;land which we took to be Saunders's i&s;land, called by the natives TAPOAMANAO, bore S. S. W. We al&s;o &s;aw land bearing N. W. &frac12; W. which Tupia &s;aid was Huaheine.</P>
<P>On the 15th, it was hazy, with light breezes and calms &s;ucceeding each other, &s;o that we could &s;ee no land, and made but little way. Our Indian, Tupia, often prayed for a wind to his god Tane, and as often boa&s;ted of his &s;ucce&s;s, which indeed he took a very effectual method to &s;ecure, for he never began his addre&s;s to Tane, till he &s;aw a breeze &s;o near that he knew it mu&s;t reach the &s;hip before his orai&s;on was well over.</P>
<P>On the 16th, we had a gentle breeze; and in the morning about eight o'clock, being clo&s;e in with the north we&s;t part of
<PB N="157" REF="013324_0184_0F90F0CF49BB8420">
of the i&s;land Huaheine, we &s;ounded, but had no bottom with 80 fathom. Some canoes very &s;oon came off, but the people, &s;eemed afraid, and kept at a di&s;tance till they di&s;covered Tupia, and then they ventured nearer. In one of the canoes that came up to the &s;hip's &s;ide, was the king of the i&s;land and his wife. Upon a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip, frequently and earne&s;tly repeated, their Maje&s;ties and &s;ome others came on board. At fir&s;t they were &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, and wondered at every thing that was &s;hewn them; yet they made no enquiries, and &s;eem|ing to be &s;atisfied with what was offered to their notice, they made no &s;earch after other objects of curio&s;ity, with which it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e a building of &s;uch novelty and magni|tude as the &s;hip mu&s;t abound. After &s;ome time, they became more familiar. I was given to under&s;tand, that the name of the king was Oree, and he propo&s;ed, as a mark of amity, that we &s;hould exchange names. To this I readily con&s;ented, and he was Cookee, for &s;o he pronounced my name, and I was Oree, for the re&s;t of the time we were together. We found the&s;e people to be very nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Otaheite, in per&s;on, dre&s;s, language, and every other circum&s;tance, ex|cept, if Tupia might be believed, that they would not &s;teal.</P>
<P>Soon after dinner, we came to an anchor, in a &s;mall but ex|cellent harbour on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, which the na|tives call Owharre, in eighteen fathom water, clear ground, and &s;ecure from all winds. I went immediately on &s;hore, ac|companied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Monkhou&s;e, Tupia, King Cookee, and &s;ome other of the natives who had been on board ever &s;ince the morning. The moment we landed Tupia &s;tripped him&s;elf as low as the wai&s;t, and de&s;ired Mr. Monkhou&s;e to do the &s;ame: he then &s;at down before a great number of the natives, who were collected together in a large hou&s;e or &s;hed; for here, as well as at Otaheite, a heu&s;e con&s;i&s;ts only of a roof, &s;upported upon poles; the re&s;t of us, by his de&s;ire, &s;tanding behind. He then began a &s;peech or prayer which la&s;ted about a quarter of an hour, the King who &s;tood over again&s;t him every now and then an&s;wering in what ap|peared to be &s;et re&s;pon&s;es. In the cour&s;e of this harangue he delivered at different times two handkerchiefs, a black &s;ilk neckcloth, &s;ome beads, two &s;mall branches of feathers, and &s;ome plantains, as pre&s;ents to their Eatua, or God. In return for the&s;e, he received for our Eatua, a hog, &s;ome young plan|tains, and two &s;mall bunches of feathers, which he ordered to be carried on board the &s;hip. After the&s;e ceremonies, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ratification of a treaty between us, every one was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to go whither he plea&s;ed; and Tupia im|mediately repaired to offer his oblations at one of the Morais.</P>
<P>The next morning we went on &s;hore again, and walked up the hills, where the productions were exactly the &s;ame as tho&s;e
<PB N="158" REF="013324_0185_0F8FFA0289EBEAC0">
of Otaheite, except that the rocks and clay appeared to be more burnt. The hou&s;es were neat, and the boat hou&s;es, re|markably large; one that we mea&s;ured was fifty paces long, ten broad, and twenty-four feet high; the whole formed a pointed arch, like tho&s;e of our old cathedrals, which was &s;up|ported on one &s;ide by twenty-&s;ix, and on the other by thirty pillars, or rather po&s;ts, about two feet high, and one thick, upon mo&s;t of which were rudely carved the heads of men, and &s;everal fanciful devices, not altogether unlike tho&s;e which we &s;ometimes &s;ee printed from wooden blocks, at the beginning and end of old books. The plains and flat part of the country, abounded in bread fruit, and cocoa-nut trees; in &s;ome places, however, there were &s;alt &s;wamps and lagoons, which would produce neither.</P>
<P>We went again on &s;hore on the 18th, and would have taken the advantage of Tupia's company, in our perambulation; but he was too much engaged with his friends: we took how|ever his boy, who&s;e name was Tayeto, and Mr. Banks went to take a farther view of what had much engaged his attention before; it was a kind of che&s;t or ark, the lid of which was nicely &s;ewed on, and thatched very neatly with palm-nut leaves: it was fixed upon two poles, and &s;upported on little arches of wood, very neatly carved; the u&s;e of the poles &s;eemed to be to remove it from place to place, in the manner of our &s;edan chairs: in one end of it was a &s;quare hole, in the middle of which was a ring touching the &s;ides, and leaving the angles open, &s;o as to form a round hole within a &s;quare one. The fir&s;t time Mr. Banks &s;aw this coffer, the aperture at the end was &s;topped with a piece of cloth, which, lea&s;t he &s;hould give of|fence, he left untouched; probably there was then &s;omething within, but now the cloth was taken away, and upon looking into it, it was found empty. The general re&s;emblance between this repo&s;itory and the ark of the Lord among the Jews is remar|kable; but it is &s;till more remarkable, that upon enquiring of the boy what it was called, he &s;aid <HI>Ewharre no Eatua</HI> the <HI>hou&s;e of the God;</HI> he could however give no account of its &s;ignifica|tion or u&s;e. We had commenced a kind of trade with the na|tives, but it went on &s;lowly; for when any thing was offered, not one of them would take it upon his own judgment, but col|lected the opinions of twenty or thirty people, which could not be done without great lo&s;s of time. We got, however, eleven pigs, and determined to try for more the next day.</P>
<P>The next day, therefore, we brought out &s;ome hatchets, for which we hoped we &s;hould have had no occa&s;ion, upon an i&s;land which no European had ever vi&s;ited before. The&s;e procured us three very large hogs; and as we propo&s;ed to &s;ail in the afternoon, King Oree and &s;everal others came on board to take their leave. To the King I gave a &s;mall plate of pewter, on
<PB N="159" REF="013324_0186_0F90F0CF71B9D7D8">
which was &s;tamped this in&s;cription, <Q>His Britannic Maje&s;ty's &s;hip, Endeavour, Lieutenant Cook, commander, 16th July, 1769, Huaheine.</Q> I give him al&s;o &s;ome medals or counters, re&s;embling the coin of England, &s;truck in the year 1761, with &s;ome other pre&s;ents; and he promi&s;ed that with none of the&s;e, particularly the plate, he would ever part. I thought it as la&s;ting a te&s;timony of our having fir&s;t di&s;covered this i&s;land, as any we could leave behind; and having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed our vi&s;itors well &s;atisfied, and in great good humour, we &s;et &s;ail, about half an hour after two in the afternoon.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Huaheine, or Huahene, is &s;ituated in the lati|tude of 16&deg; 43&prime; S. and longitude 150&deg; 52&prime; W. from Greenwich: it is di&s;tant from Otaheite about thirty one leagues in the di|rection of N. 58 W. and is about &s;even leagues in compa&s;s. Its &s;urface is hilly and uneven, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d it has a &s;afe and commodious harbour. The harbour, which is called by the natives Owallee, or Owharre, lies on the we&s;t &s;ide, under the northermo&s;t high land, and within the north end of the reef, which lies along that &s;ide of the i&s;land; there are two inlets and openings, by which it may be entered, through the reef, about a mile and a half di&s;tant from each other; the &s;outhermo&s;t is the wide&s;t, and on the &s;outh &s;ide of it lies a very &s;mall &s;andy i&s;land.</P>
<P>Huaheine &s;eems to be a month forwarder in its productions than Otaheite, as we found the cocoa-nuts full of kernel, and &s;ome of the new bread-fruit fit to eat. Of the cocoa-nuts the inhabitants make a food which they call <HI>Poe,</HI> by mixing them with yams; they &s;crape both fine, and having incorporated the powder, they put it into a wooden trough, with a number of hot &s;tones, by which an oily kind of ha&s;ty pudding is made, that our people reli&s;hed very well, e&s;pecially when it was fryed. Mr. Banks found not more than eleven or twelve new plants; but he ob&s;erved &s;ome in&s;ects, and a &s;pecies of &s;corpion which he had not &s;een before.</P>
<P>The inhabitants &s;eem to be larger made, and more &s;tout than tho&s;e of Otaheite. Mr. Banks mea&s;ured one of the men, and found him to be &s;ix feet three inches and an half high; yet they are &s;o lazy, that he could not per&s;uade any of them to go up the hills with him: they &s;aid, if they were to attempt it, the fatigue would kill them. The women were very fair, more &s;o than tho&s;e of Otaheite; and in general, we thought them more hand&s;ome, though none that were equal to &s;ome individuals. Both &s;exes &s;eemed to be le&s;s timid, and le&s;s curious: it has been ob&s;erved, that they made no enquiries on board the &s;hip; and when we fired a gun, they were frighted indeed, but they did not fall down, as our friends at Otaheite con&s;tantly did when we fir&s;t came among them. For this dif|ference, however, we can ea&s;ily account upon other princi|ples; the people of Huaheine had not &s;een the Dolphin,
<PB N="160" REF="013324_0187_0F8FFA04B7E6E9C0">
tho&s;e at Otaheite had. In one, the report of a gun was con|nected with the idea of in&s;tant de&s;truction; to the other, there was nothing dreadful in it but the appearance and the &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, as they had never experienced its power of di&s;pen&s;ing death.</P>
<P>While we were on &s;hore, we found that Tupia had com|mended them beyond their merit, when he &s;aid that they would not &s;teal; for one of them was detected in the fact. But when he was &s;eized by the hair, the re&s;t in&s;tead of running away, as the people at Otaheite would have done, gathered round, and en|quired what provocation had been given: but this al&s;o may be accounted for without giving them credit for &s;uperior courage; they had no experience of the con&s;equences of European re&s;ent|ment, which the people at Otaheite had in many in&s;tances pur|cha&s;ed with life. It mu&s;t however be acknowledged, to their honour, that when they under&s;tood what had happened, they &s;hewed &s;trong &s;igns of di&s;approbation, and pre&s;cribed a good beating for the thief, which was immediately admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>We now made &s;ail for the i&s;land of Ulietea, which lies S. W. by W. di&s;tant &s;even or eight leagues from Huaheine, and at half an hour after &s;ix in the evening we were within three leagues of the &s;hore, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide. We &s;tood off and on all night, and when the day broke the next morning, we &s;tood in for the &s;hore: we &s;oon after di&s;covered an opening in the reef which lies before the i&s;land, within which Tupia told us there was a good harbour. I did not, however, implicitly take his word; but &s;ent the ma&s;ter out in the pinnace to examine it: he &s;oon made the &s;ignal for the &s;hip to follow; we accor|dingly &s;tood in, and anchored in two and twenty fathom, with &s;oft ground.</P>
<P>The natives &s;oon came off to us in two canoes, each of which brought a woman and a pig. The woman we &s;uppo&s;ed was a mark of confidence, and the pig was a pre&s;ent; we re|ceived both with proper acknowledgments, and complimented each of the ladies with a &s;pike nail and &s;ome beads, much to their &s;atisfaction. We were told by Tupia, who had always expre&s;&s;ed much fear of the men of Bolabola, that they had made a conque&s;t of this i&s;land, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d that if we remained here, they would certainly come down to-morrow, and fight us. We determined, therefore, to go on &s;hore without delay, while the day was our own.</P>
<P>I landed in company with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the other gentlemen, Tupia being al&s;o of the party. He intro|duced us by repeating t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e ceremonies which he had performed at Huaheine, after which I hoi&s;ted an Engli&s;h jack, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this and the three neighbouring i&s;lands, Huaheine, Otaha, and Bolabola, which were all in &s;ight, in the name of his Britannic maje&s;ty. After this, we took a walk to a great Morai, called Tapod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">boatea. We found it very different from
<PB N="161" REF="013324_0188_0F90F0D009955A98">
tho&s;e of Otaheite; for it con&s;i&s;ted only of four walls, about eight feet high, of coral &s;tones, &s;ome of which were of an immen&s;e &s;ize, inclo&s;ing an area of about five and twenty yards &s;quare, which was filled up with &s;maller &s;tones: upon the top of it many planks were &s;et up an end, which were carved in their whole length: at a little di&s;tance we found an altar, or Ewhatta, upon which lay the la&s;t oblation or &s;acrifice, a hog of about eighty pounds weight, which had been offered whole, and very nicely roa&s;ted. Here were al&s;o four or five Ewharre-no-Eatua, or hou&s;es of God, to which carriage poles were fitted, like that which we had &s;een at Huaheine. One of the&s;e Mr. Banks ex|amined by putting his hand into it, and found a parcel about five feet long and one thick, wrapped up in matts: he broke a way through &s;everal of the&s;e matts with his fingers, but at length came to one which was made of the fibres of the cocoa|nut, &s;o firmly plaited together that he found it impo&s;&s;ible to tear it, and therefore was forced to de&s;i&s;t; e&s;pecially as he per|ceived, that what he had done already gave great offence to our new friends. From hence we went to a long hou&s;e, not far di&s;tant, where among rolls of cloth, and &s;everal other things, we &s;aw the model af a canoe, about three feet long, to which were tied eight human jaw bones; we had already learnt that the&s;e, like &s;calps among the Indians of North-America, were trophies of war. Tupia affirmed that they were the jaw-bones of the natives of this i&s;land; if &s;o, they might have been hung up, with the model of a canoe, as a &s;ymbol of inva&s;ion, by the warriors of Bolabola, as a memorial of their conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Night now came on apace, but Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander continued their walk along the &s;hore, and at a little di&s;tance &s;aw an other Ewharre-no-Eatua, and a tree of the fig kind, the &s;ame as that which Mr. Green had &s;een at Otaheite, in great perfection, the trunk, or rather congeries of the roots of which was forty-two paces in circumference.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, having di&s;patched the ma&s;ter in the long boat to examine the coa&s;t of the &s;outh part of the i&s;land, and one of the mates in the yawl, to found the harbour where the &s;hip lay, I went my&s;elf in the pinnace, to &s;urvey that part of the i&s;land which lies to the north. Mr. Banks and the gentlemen were again on &s;hore, trading with the natives, and examining the products and curio&s;ities of the country; they &s;aw nothing, how|ever, worthy notice, but &s;ome more jaw-bones, of which they made no doubt but that the account they had heard was true.</P>
<P>On the 22d and 23d, having &s;trong gales and hazey wea|ther, I did not thick it &s;afe to put to &s;ea; but on the 24th, though the wind was &s;till variable, I got under &s;ail, and plyed to the northward within the reef, with a view to go out at a wider opening than that by which I had entered; in doing this, however, I was unexpectedly in the mo&s;t imminent
<PB N="162" REF="013324_0189_0F8FFA04CA88DE70">
danger of &s;triking on the rock: the Ma&s;ter, whom I had or|dered to keep continually &s;ounding in the chains, &s;uddenly called out, "two fathom." This alarmed me, for though I knew the &s;hip drew at lea&s;t fourteen feet, and that therefore it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch a &s;hoal &s;hould be under her keel; yet the ma&s;ter was either mi&s;taken, or &s;he went along the edge of a coral rock, many of which, in the neighbourhood of the&s;e i&s;lands, are as &s;teep as a wall.</P>
<P>This harbour or bay is called by the natives OOPOA, and taken in its greate&s;t extent, it is capable of holding any num|ber of &s;hipping. It extends almo&s;t the whole length of the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and is defended from the &s;ea by a reef of coral rocks: the &s;outhermo&s;t opening in this reef, or channel into the harbour, by which we entered, is little more than a cable's length wide; it lies off the ea&s;termo&s;t point of the i&s;land, and may be known by another &s;mall woody i&s;land, which lies a little to the &s;outh ea&s;t of it, called by the people here OATARA. Between three and four miles north we&s;t from this i&s;land lie two other i&s;lets, in the &s;ame direction as the reef, of which they are a part, called OPURURU and TA|MOU; between the&s;e lies the other channel into the harbour, through which I went out and which is a full quarter of a mile wide. Still farther to the north we&s;t are &s;ome other &s;mall i&s;lands, near which I am told there is another &s;mall channel into the harbour; but this I know only by report.</P>
<P>The principal refre&s;hments that are to be procured at this part of the i&s;land are, plantains, cocoa-nuts, yams, hogs, and fowls; the hogs and fowls, however, are &s;carce; and the country, where we &s;aw it, is neither &s;o populous, nor &s;o rich in produce as Otaheite, or even Huaheine. Wood and water may al&s;o be procured here; but the water cannot conve|niently be got at.</P>
<P>We were now again at &s;ea, without having received any interruption from the ho&s;tile inhabitants of Bolabola, whom notwith&s;tanding the fears of Tupia, we intended to vi&s;it. At four o'clock in the afternoon of the 25th, we were within a league of Otaha, which bore N. 77 W. To the northward of the &s;outh end of that i&s;land, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it, and &s;ome|thing more than a mile from the &s;hore, lie two &s;mall i&s;lands, called TOAHOUTU and WHENNUAIA; between which, Tu|pia &s;ays, there is a channel into a very good harbour, which lies within the reef, and appearances confirmed his report.</P>
<P>As I di&s;covered a broad channel between Otaha and Bola|bola, I determined rather to go through it, than run to the northward of all; but the wind being right a head, I got no ground.</P>
<P>Between five and &s;ix in the evening of the 26th, as I was &s;tanding to the northward, I di&s;covered a &s;mall low i&s;land,
<PB N="163" REF="013324_0190_0F8FFA05CC0B9A58">
lying N. by W. or N. N. W. di&s;tant four or five leagues from Bolabola. We were told by Tupia that the name of this i&s;land is TUBAI; that it produces nothing but cocoa-nuts, and is inhabited only by three families; though it is vi&s;ited by the inhabitants of the neighbouring i&s;lands, who re&s;ort thi|ther to catch fi&s;h, with which the coa&s;t abounds.</P>
<P>On the 27th, about noon, the peak of Bolabola bore N. 25 W. and the north end of Otaha, N. 80 W. di&s;tant three leagues. The wind continued contrary all this day and the night following. On the 28th, at &s;ix in the morning, we were near the entrance of the harbour, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of OTAHA, which has been ju&s;t mentioned; and finding that it might be examined without lo&s;ing time, I &s;ent away the ma&s;ter in the long boat, with orders to &s;ound it; and, if the wind did not &s;hift in our favour, to land upon the i&s;land, and traffic with the natives for &s;uch refre&s;hments as were to be had. In this boat went Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who landed upon the i&s;land, and before night purcha&s;ed three hogs, twenty-one fowls, and as many yams and plantains as the boat would hold. Plantains we thought a more u&s;eful refre&s;hment even than pork; for they were boiled and &s;erved to the &s;hip's com|pany as bread, and were now the more acceptable as our bread was &s;o full of vermin, that notwith&s;tanding all po&s;&s;ible care, we had &s;ometimes twenty of them in our mouths at a time, every one of which ta&s;ted as hot as mu&s;tard. The i&s;land &s;eemed to be more barren than Ulietea, but the produce was of the &s;ame kind. The people al&s;o exactly re&s;embled tho&s;e that we had &s;een at the other i&s;lands; they were not numerous, but they flocked about the boat wherever &s;he went from all quarters, bringing with them whatever they had to &s;ell&punc; They paid the &s;trangers, of whom they had received an account from Tupia, the &s;ame compliment which they u&s;ed towards their own kings, uncovering their &s;houlders, and wrapping their garments round their brea&s;ts; and were &s;o &s;olicitous to pre|vent its being neglected by any of their people, that a man was &s;ent with them, who called out to every one they met, telling him what they were, and what he was to do.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I kept plying off and on, waiting for the boat's return; at half an hour after five, not &s;eeing any thing of her, I fired a gun, and after it was dark hoi&s;ted a light; at half an hour after eight, we heard the report of a mu&s;quet, which we an&s;wered with a gun, and &s;oon after the boat came on board. The Ma&s;ter reported, that the harbour was &s;afe and commodious, with good anchorage from twenty-five to &s;ixteen fathom water, clear ground.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the boat was hoi&s;ted in, I made &s;ail to the north|ward, and at eight o'cloch in the morning of the 29th, we were clo&s;e under the peak of Bolabola, which was high, rude,
<PB N="164" REF="013324_0191_0F8FFA064B28EF00">
and craggy. As the i&s;land was altogether inacce&s;&s;ible in this part, and we found it impo&s;&s;ible to weather it, we tacked and &s;tood off, then tacked again, and after many trips did not weather the &s;outh end of it till twelve o'clock at night. At eight o'clock the next morning, we di&s;covered an i&s;land, which bore from us N. 63&deg; W. di&s;tant about eight leagues; at the &s;ame time the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Bolabola bore N. &frac12; E. di&s;tant three or four leagues. This i&s;land Tupia called MAURUA, and &s;aid that it was &s;mall, wholly &s;urrounded by a reef, and without any harbour for &s;hipping; but inhabited, and beari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g the &s;ame produce as the neighbouring i&s;lands; the middle of it ri&s;es in a high round hill, that may be &s;een at the di&s;tance of ten leagues.</P>
<P>When we were off Bolabola, we &s;aw but few people on the &s;hore, and were told by Tupia that many of the inhabitants were gone to Ulietea. In the afternoon we &s;ound our&s;elves nearly the length of the &s;outh end of Ulietea, and to wind|ward of &s;ome harbours that lay on the we&s;t &s;ide of this i&s;land. Into one of the&s;e harbours, though we had before been a&s;hore on the other &s;ide of the i&s;land, I intended to put, in order to &s;top a leak which we had &s;prung in the powder room, and to take in more balla&s;t, as I found the &s;hip too light to carry &s;ail upon a wind. As the wind was right again&s;t us, we plied off one of the harbours, and about three o'clock in the after|noon, on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, we came to an anchor in the en|trance of the channel leading into it in fourteen fathom wa|ter, being prevented from working in, by a tide which &s;et very &s;trong out. We then carried out the kedge-anchor, in order to warp into the harbour; but when this was done, we could not trip the bower-anchor with all the purcha&s;e we could make; we were therefore obliged to lie &s;till all night, and in the morning when the tide turned, the &s;hip going over the an|chor, it tripped of it&s;elf, and we warped the &s;hip into a pro|per birth with ea&s;e, and moored in twenty-eight fathom, with a &s;andy bottom. While this was doing many of the natives came off to us with hogs, fowls, and plantains, which they parted with at an ea&s;y rate.</P>
<P>When the &s;hip was &s;ecured, I went on &s;hore to look for a proper place to get balla&s;t and water, both which I found in a very convenient &s;ituation.</P>
<P>This day Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander &s;pent on &s;hore very much to their &s;atisfaction; every body &s;eemed to fear and re&s;pect them, placing in them at the &s;ame time the utmo&s;t confidence, behaving as if con&s;cious, that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of doing them mi&s;chief, without any propen&s;ity to make u&s;e of it. Men, women and children crowded round them, and followed them wherever they went; but none of them were guilty of the lea&s;t incivility: on the contrary,
<PB N="165" REF="013324_0192_0F90F0D0C3ACB838">
whenever there happened to be dirt or water in the way, the men vied with each other to carry them over on their backs. They were conducted to, the hou&s;es of the principal people, and were received in a manner altogether new: the people, who followed them while they were in their way, ru&s;hed for|ward as &s;oon as they came to a hou&s;e, and went in ha&s;tily be|fore them, leaving however a lane &s;ufficiently wide for them to pa&s;s. When they entered, they found tho&s;e who had pre|ceded them ranged on each &s;ide of a long matt, which was &s;pread upon the ground, and at the farther end of which &s;at the family: in the fir&s;t hou&s;e they entered they found &s;ome very young women or children, dre&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t neatne&s;s, who kept their &s;tation, expecting the &s;trangers to come up to them and to make them pre&s;ents, which they did with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure; for prettier children, or better dre&s;&s;ed they had never &s;een. One of them was a girl about &s;ix years old; her gown, or upper garment, was red; a large quantity of plaited hair was wound round her head, the or|nament to which they give of Tamou, and which they value more than any thing they po&s;&s;e&s;s. She fat at the upper end of a matt thirty feet long, upon which none of the &s;pectators pre&s;umed to &s;et a foot, notwith&s;tanding the crowd; and &s;he leaned upon the arm of a well-looking woman about thirty, who was probably her nur&s;e. Our Gentlemen walked up to her, and as &s;oon as they approached, &s;he &s;tretched out her hand to receive the beads which they offered her, and no prince&s;s in Europe could have done it with a better grace.</P>
<P>The people were &s;o much gratified by the pre&s;ents which were made to the&s;e girls, that when Mr. Banks and Dr. So|lander returned they &s;eemed attentive to nothing but how to oblige them; and in one of the hou&s;es they were, by order of the ma&s;ter, entertained with a dance, different from any that they had &s;een. It was performed by one man, who put upon his head a large cylindrical piece of wicker-work, or ba&s;ket, about four feet long, and eight inches in diameter, which was faced with feathers, placed perpendicularly, with the tops bending forwards, and edged round with &s;hark's teeth, and the tail feathers of Tropic birds: when he had put on his head-dre&s;s, which is called a <HI>Whow,</HI> he began to dance, moving &s;lowly, and often turning his head &s;o as that the top of his high wicker-cap de&s;cribed a circle, and &s;ometimes throwing it &s;o near the faces of the &s;pectators as to make them &s;tart back: this was held among them as a very good joke, and never failed to produce a peal of laughter, e&s;pecially when it was played off upon one of the &s;trangers.</P>
<P>On the 3d, we went along the &s;hore to the northward, which was in a direction oppo&s;ite to that of the route Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander had taken the day before, with a de|&s;ign
<PB N="166" REF="013324_0193_0F8FFB954A8A0750">
to purcha&s;e &s;tock, which we always found the people more ready to part with, and at a more ea&s;y price, at their hou&s;es than at the market. In the cour&s;e of our walk we met with a company of dancers, who detained us two hours, and during all that time afforded us great entertainment. The company con&s;i&s;ted of two women dancers, and fix men, with three drums; we were informed by Tupia, that they were &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable people of the i&s;land, and that though they were continually going from place to place, they did not, like the little &s;trolling companies companies of Otaheite, take any gratuity from the &s;pectators The women had upon their heads a con&s;iderable quantity of Tamou, or plaited hair, which was brought &s;everal times round the head, and adorned in many parts with the flowers of the cape-je&s;&s;amine, which were &s;tuck in with much ta&s;te, and made a head-dre&s;s truly elegant. Their necks, &s;houlders, and arms were naked; &s;o were the brea&s;ts al&s;o as low as the parting of the arm; below that, they were covered with black cloth, which &s;et clo&s;e to the body; at the &s;ide of each brea&s;t, next the arm, was placed a &s;mall plume of black feathers, much in the &s;ame manner as our ladies now wear their no&s;egays or bouquets; upon their hips re&s;ted a quantity of cloth plaited very full, which reached up to the brea&s;t, and fell down below into long petticoats, which quite concealed their feet, and which they managed with as much dexterity as our opera dancers could have done: the plaits above the wai&s;t were brown and white alternately, the petticoats below were all white.</P>
<P>In this dre&s;s they advanced &s;ideways in a mea&s;ured &s;tep, keeping excellent time to the drums, which beat bri&s;kly and loud; &s;oon after they began to &s;hake their hips, giving the folds of cloth, that lay upon them, a very quick motion, which was in &s;ome degree continued through the whole dance, though the body was thrown into various po&s;tures, &s;ometimes &s;tanding, &s;ometimes &s;itting, and &s;ometimes re&s;ting on their knees and elbows, the fingers al&s;o being moved at the &s;ame time with a quickne&s;s &s;carce to be imagined. Much of the dexterity of the dancers, however, and the entertainment of the &s;pectators, con&s;i&s;ted in the wantonne&s;s of their attitudes and ge&s;tures, which was, indeed, &s;uch as exceeds all de&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e girls had in her ear three pearls; one of them was very large, but &s;o foul that it was of little value; the other two were as big as a middling pea; the&s;e were clear, and of a good colour and &s;hape, though &s;poiled by the dril|ling. Mr. Banks would fain have purcha&s;ed them, and offered the owner any thing &s;he would a&s;k for them, but &s;he could not be per&s;uaded to part with them at any price: he tempted her with the value of four hogs, and whatever el&s;e &s;he &s;hould
<PB N="167" REF="013324_0194_0F8FFB9609C94790">
chu&s;e, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and indeed they &s;et a value upon their pearls very nearly equal to what they would fetch among us, except they could be procured before they are drilled.</P>
<P>Between the dances of the women, the men performed a kind of dramatic interlude, in which there was dialogue as well as dancing; but we were not &s;ufficiently acquainted with their language to under&s;tand the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>On the 4th, &s;ome of our gentlemen &s;aw a much more re|gular entertainment of the dramatic kind, which was divided into four acts.</P>
<P>Tupia had often told us that he had large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this i&s;land, which had been taken away from him by the inhabi|tants of Bolabola, and he now pointed them out in the very bay where the &s;hip was at anchor. Upon our going on &s;hore, this was confirmed by the inhabitants, who &s;hewed us &s;everal di&s;tricts or Whennuas, which they acknowledged to be his right.</P>
<P>On the 5th, I received a pre&s;ent of three hogs, &s;ome fowls, &s;everal pieces of cloth, the large&s;t we had &s;een, being fifty yards long, which they unfolded and di&s;played &s;o as to make the greate&s;t &s;how po&s;&s;ible; and a con&s;iderable quantity of plantains, cocoa-nuts, and other refre&s;hments, from Opoony, the formidable king, or, in the language of the country, Earee rahie, of Bolabola, with a me&s;&s;age that he was at this time upon the i&s;land, and that the next day he intended to pay me a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went upon the hills, accompanied by &s;everal of the Indians, who con|ducted them by excellent paths, to &s;uch a height, that they plainly &s;aw the other &s;ide of the i&s;land, and the pa&s;&s;age thro' which the &s;hip had pa&s;&s;ed the reef between the little i&s;lands of Opururu and Tamou, when we landed upon it the fir&s;t time. As they were returning, they &s;aw the Indians exer|ci&s;ing them&s;elves at what they call <HI>Erowhaw,</HI> which is no|thing more than pitching a kind of light lance, headed with hard wood, at a mark: in this amu&s;ement, though they &s;eem very fond of it, they do not excel, for not above one in twelve &s;truck the mark, which was the bole of a plaintain tree, at about twenty yards di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 6th, we all &s;taid at home, expecting the vi&s;it of the great king, but we were di&s;appointed; we had, however, much more agreeable company, for he &s;ent three very pretty girls to demand &s;omething in return for his pre&s;ent: perhaps he was unwilling to tru&s;t him&s;elf on board the &s;hip, or per|haps he thought his me&s;&s;engers would procure a more valuable return for his hogs and poultry than he could him&s;elf; be that as it may, we did not regret his ab&s;ence, nor his me&s;&s;engers their vi&s;it.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="013324_0195_0F90F2B22FEFBE68">
In the afternoon, as the great king would not come to us, we determined to go to the great king. As he was lord of the Bolabola men, the conquerors of this, and the terror of all the other i&s;lands, we expected to &s;ee a Chief young and vigorous, with an intelligent countenance, and an enter|pri&s;ing &s;pirit: we found, however, a poor feeble wretch, withered and decrepit, half blind with age, and &s;o &s;luggi&s;h and &s;tupid that he appeared &s;carcely to have under&s;tanding enough left to knew that it was probable we &s;hould be grati|fied either by hogs or women. He did not receive us &s;itting, or with any &s;tate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> formality, as the other Chiefs had done: we made him our pre&s;ent, which he accepted, and gave a hog in return. We had learnt that his principal re&s;idence was at Otaha; and upon our telling him that we intended to go thither in our boats the next morning, and that we &s;hould be glad to have him along with us, he promi&s;ed to be of the party.</P>
<P>Early in the morning, therefore, I &s;et out both with the pinnace and long-boat for Otaha, having &s;ome of the gentle|men with me; and in our way we called upon Opoony, who was in his canoe ready to join us. As &s;oon as we landed at Otaha, I made him a pre&s;ent of an ax, which I thought might induce him to encourage his &s;ubjects to bring us &s;uch provi&s;ion as we wanted; but in this we found our&s;elves &s;adly di&s;ap|pointed, for after &s;taying with him till noon, we left him without being able to procure a &s;ingle article. I then pro|ceeded to the north point of the i&s;land, in the pinnace, hav|ing &s;ent the long-boat another way. As I went along I picked up half a dozen hogs, as many fowls, and &s;ome plan|tains and yams. Having viewed and &s;ketched the harbour on this &s;ide of the i&s;land, I made the be&s;t of my way back, with the long-boat, which joined me &s;oon after it was dark; and about ten o'clock at night we got on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>In this excur&s;ion Mr. Banks was not with us; he &s;pent the morning on board the &s;hip, trading with the natives, who came off in their canoes, for provi&s;ions and curio&s;ities; and in the afternoon he went on &s;hore with his draught man, to &s;ketch the dre&s;&s;es of the dancers, which he had &s;een a day or two before. He found the company exactly the &s;ame, ex|cept that another woman had been added to it: the dancing al&s;o of the women was the &s;ame, but the interludes of the men were &s;omewhat varied; he &s;aw five or &s;ix performed, which were different from each other, and very much re&s;embled the drama of our &s;tage dances. The next day, he went a&s;hore again, with Dr. Solander, and they directed their cour&s;e to|wards the dancing company, which, from the time of our &s;econd landing, had gradually moved about two leagues in their cour&s;e round the i&s;land. They &s;aw more dancing and
<PB N="169" REF="013324_0196_0F90F2B254D54080">
more interludes, the interludes &s;till varying from each other: in one of them the performers, who were all men, were divided into two parties, which were di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by the colour of their cloaths, one being brown and the other white. The brown party repre&s;ented a ma&s;ter and &s;ervants, and the white party a company of thieves: the ma&s;ter gave a ba&s;ket of meat to the re&s;t of his party, with a charge to take care of it: the dance of the white party con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal ex|pedients to &s;teal it, and that of the brown party in preventing their &s;ucce&s;s. After &s;ome time, tho&s;e who had charge of the ba&s;ket placed them&s;elves round it, upon the ground, and lean|ing upon it, appeared to go to &s;leep; the others, improving this opportunity, came gently upon them, and lifting them up from the ba&s;ket, carried off their prize: the &s;leepers &s;oon after awakening, mi&s;&s;ed their ba&s;ket, but pre&s;ently fell a dancing, without any farther regarding their lo&s;s; &s;o that the dramatic action of this dance was, according to the &s;evere&s;t laws of critici&s;m, one, and our lovers of &s;implicity would have been gratified with an entertainment perfectly &s;uited to the cha&s;tity of their ta&s;te.</P>
<P>On the 9th, having &s;pent the morning in trading with the canoes, we took the opportunity of a breeze, which &s;prung up at Ea&s;t, and having &s;topped our leak, and got the fre&s;h &s;tock which we had purcha&s;ed on board, we &s;ailed out of the harbour. When we were &s;ailing away, Tupia &s;trongly urged me to fire a &s;hot towards Bolabola, po&s;&s;ibly as a mark of his re&s;entment, and to &s;hew the power of his new allies: in this I thought proper to gratify him, though we were &s;even leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>While we were about the&s;e i&s;lands, we expended very little of the &s;hip's provi&s;ions, and were very plentifully &s;upplied with hogs, fowls, plantains and yams, which we hoped would have been of great u&s;e to us in our cour&s;e to the &s;outh|ward; but the hogs would not eat European grain of any kind, pul&s;e, or bread-du&s;t, &s;o that we could not pre&s;erve them alive; and the fowls were all very &s;oon &s;eized with a di&s;ea&s;e that affected the head &s;o, that they continued to hold it down between their legs till they died: much dependence therefore mu&s;t not be placed in live &s;tock, taken on board at the&s;e places, at lea&s;t not till a di&s;covery is made of &s;ome food that the hogs will eat, and &s;ome remedy for the di&s;ea&s;e of the poultry.</P>
<P>Having been nece&s;&s;arily detained at Ulietea &s;o long, by the carpenters in &s;topping our leak, we determined to give up our de&s;ign of going on &s;hore at Bolabola, e&s;pecially as it appeared to be difficult of acce&s;s.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;ix i&s;lands, Ulietea, Otaha, Bolabola, Huaheine, Tubai, and Maurua, as they lie contiguous to each other, I

the names of SOCIETY ISLANDS, but did not think it pro|per to di&s;tingui&s;h them &s;eparately by any other names than tho&s;e by which they were known to the natives.</P>
<P>They are &s;ituated between the latitude of 16&deg; 10&prime; and 16&prime; 55&prime; S. and between the longitude of 150&deg; 57&prime; and 152&deg; W. from the meridian of Greenwich. Ulietea and Otaha lie within about two miles of each other, and are both inclo&s;ed within one reef of coral rocks, &s;o that there is no pa&s;&s;age for &s;hipping between them. This reef forms &s;everal excellent harbours; the entrances into them, indeed, are but narrow, yet when a &s;hip is once in, nothing can hurt her. The har|bours on the ea&s;t &s;ide have been de&s;cribed already; and on the we&s;t &s;ide of Ulietea, which is the large&s;t of the two, there are three. The northermo&s;t, in which we lay, is called O|HAMANENO: the channel leading into it is about quarter of a mile wide, and lies between two low &s;andy i&s;lands, which are the northermo&s;t on this &s;ide; between, or ju&s;t within the two i&s;lands, there is good anchorage in twenty-eight fathom, &s;oft ground. This harbour, though &s;mall, is preferable to the others, becau&s;e it is &s;ituated in the mo&s;t fertile part of the i&s;land, and where fre&s;h water is ea&s;ily to be got. The other two harbours lie to the &s;outhward of this, and not far from the &s;outh end of the i&s;land: in both of them there is good anchorage, with ten, twelve, and fourteen fathom. They are ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">y known by three &s;mall woody i&s;lands at their en|trance. The &s;outhermo&s;t of the&s;e two harbours lies within, and to the &s;outhward of the &s;outhermo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands, and the other lies between the two northermo&s;t. I was told that there were more harbours at the &s;outh end of this i&s;land, but I did not examine whether the report was true.</P>
<P>Otaha affords 2 very good harbours, that on the ea&s;t &s;ide is called Ohamene, and has been mentioned already; the other is called OHERURUA, and lies about the middle of the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land; it is pretty large, and affords good anchorage in twenty and twenty-five fathom, nor is there any want of fre&s;h water. The breach in the reef, that forms a channel into this harbour, is about a quarter of a mile broad, and like all the re&s;t is very &s;teep on both &s;ides; in general there is no danger here but what is vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Bolabola lies N. W. and by W. from Otaha, di&s;tant about four leagues; it is &s;urrounded by a reef of rocks, and &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, in compa&s;s together about eight leagues. I was told, that on the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land there is a channel through the reef, into a very good har|bour, but I did not think it worth while to examine it, for the rea&s;ons that have been ju&s;t a&s;&s;igned. This i&s;land is ren|dered very remarkable by a high craggy hill, which appears
<PB N="171" REF="013324_0198_0F90F2B33B41C4F0">
to be almo&s;t perpendicular, and terminates at the top in two peaks, one higher than the other.</P>
<P>The land of Ulietea and Otaha is hilly, broken, and irre|gular, except on the &s;ea coa&s;t, yet the hills look green and plea&s;ant, and are in many places clothed with wood. The &s;everal particulars in which the&s;e i&s;lands and their inhabitants differ from what we had ob&s;erved at Otaheite, have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|tioned in the cour&s;e of the narrative.</P>
<P>We pur&s;ued our cour&s;e without any event worthy of not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the 13th, about noon, when we &s;aw land bearing S. E. which Tupia told us was an i&s;land called OHETEROA. About &s;ix in the evening, we were within two or three leagues of it, upon which I &s;hortened &s;ail, and &s;tood off and on all night: the next morning &s;tood in for the land. We ran to leeward of the i&s;land, keeping clo&s;e in &s;hore, and &s;aw &s;everal of the na|tives, though in no great numbers, upon the beach. At nine o'clock I &s;ent Mr. Gore, one of my Lieutenants, in the pin|nace, to endeavour to land upon the i&s;land, and learn from the natives whether there was anchorage in a bay then in &s;ight, and what land lay farther to the &s;outhward. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander accompanied Mr. Gore in this expedition, and as they thought Tupia might be u&s;eful, they took him with them.</P>
<P>As the boat approached the &s;hore, tho&s;e on board perceived the natives to be armed with long lances: as they did not in|tend to land till they got round a point which run out at a little di&s;tance, they &s;tood along the coa&s;t, and the natives therefore very probably thought they were afraid of them. They had now got together to the number of about &s;ixty, and all of them &s;at down upon the &s;hore, except two, who were di&s;patched forward to ob&s;erve the motions of tho&s;e in the boat. The&s;e men, after walking a-brea&s;t of her for &s;ome time, at length leaped into the water, and &s;wam towards her, but were &s;oon left behind; two more then appeared, and attempted to board her in the &s;ame manner, but they al&s;o were &s;oon left be|hind; a fifth man then ran forward alone, and having got a good way a-head of the boat before he took to the water, ea&s;ily reached her. Mr. Banks urged the officer to take him in, thinking it a good opportunity to get the confidence and good will of a people, who then certainly looked upon them as enemies; but he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, this man was therefore left behind like the others, and &s;o was a &s;ixth, who followed him.</P>
<P>When the boat had got round the point, &s;he perceived that all her followers had de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit: &s;he now open|ed a large bay, at the bottom of which appeared another body of men, armed with long lances like the fir&s;t. Here our peo|ple prepared to land, and pu&s;hed towards the &s;hore, a canoe at the &s;ame time putting off to meet them. As &s;oon as it
<PB N="172" REF="013324_0199_0F8FFB9951982A68">
came near them, they lay upon their oars, and calling out to them, told them that they were friends, and that if they would come up they would give them nails, which were held up for them to &s;ee: after &s;ome he&s;itation they came up to the boat's &s;tern, and took &s;ome nails that were offered them with great &s;eeming &s;atisfaction; but in le&s;s than a minute they ap|peared to have formed a de&s;ign of boarding the boat, and mak|ing her their prize: three of them &s;uddenly leaped into it, and the others brought up the canoe, which the motion in quitting her had thrown off a little, manife&s;tly with a de&s;ign to follow their a&s;&s;ociates, and &s;upport them in their attempt. The fir&s;t that boarded the boat, entered clo&s;e to Mr. Banks, and in&s;tantly &s;natched his powder-horn out of his pocket: Mr. Banks &s;eized it, and with &s;ome difficulty wrenched it out of his hand, at the &s;ame time pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t his brea&s;t, in order to force him over-board, but he was too &s;trong for him, and kept his place: the officer then &s;napped his piece, but it mi&s;&s;ed fire, upon which he ordered &s;ome of the people to fire over their heads; two pieces were accordingly di&s;charged, upon which they all in&s;tantly leaped into the water: one of the people, either from cowardice or cruelty, or both, level|led a third piece at one of them, as he was &s;wimming away, and the ball grazed his forehead; happily, however the wound was very &s;light, for he recovered the canoe, and &s;tood up in her as active and vigorous as the re&s;t. The canoe im|mediately &s;tood in for the &s;hore, where a great number of people, not le&s;s than two hundred, were now a&s;&s;embled. The boat al&s;o pu&s;hed in, but found the land guarded all round with a &s;hoal, upon which the &s;ea broke with a con&s;iderable &s;urf; it was therefore thought advi&s;eable by the officer to proceed along &s;hore in &s;earch of a more convenient landing-place: in the mean time the people on board &s;aw the canoe go on &s;hore, and the natives gather eagerly round her to enquire the parti|culars of what had happened. Soon after, a &s;ingle man ran along the &s;hore, armed with his lance, and when he came a-brea&s;t of the boat he began to dance, brandi&s;h his weapon, and call out in a very &s;hrill tone, which Tupia &s;aid was a de|fiance from the people. The boat continued to row along the &s;hore, and the champion followed it, repeating his defiance by his voice and his ge&s;tures; but no better landing-place be|ing found than that where the canoe had put the natives on &s;hore, the officer turned back with a view to attempt it there, hoping, that if it &s;hould not be practicable, the people would come to a conference either on the &s;hoals, or in their canoes, and that a treaty of peace might be concluded with them.</P>
<P>As the boat rowed &s;lowly along the &s;hore back again, an|other champion came down, &s;houting defiance, and brandi&s;h|ing his lance: his appearance was more formidable than that
<PB N="173" REF="013324_0200_0F90F2B4ADEE83B0">
of the other, for he wore a large cap made of the tail feathers of the tropic bird, and his body was covered with &s;tripes of different coloured cloth, yellow, red, and brown. This gentle|man al&s;o danced, but with much more nimblene&s;s and dexte|rity than the fir&s;t; our people therefore, con&s;idering his agi|lity and his dre&s;s, di&s;tingui&s;hed him by the name of HARLE|QUIN. Soon after a more grave and elderly man came down to the beach, and hailing the people in the boat, enquired who they were, and from whence they came; Tupia an&s;wered in their own language, from Otaheite: the three natives then walked peaceably along the &s;hore till they came to a &s;hoal, upon which a few people were collected; here they &s;topped, and after a &s;hort conference, they all began to pray very loud: Tupia made his re&s;pon&s;es, but continued to tell us that they were not our friends. When their prayer, or as they call it, their <HI>Poorah,</HI> was over, our people entered into a parley with them, telling them, that if they would lay by their lances and clubs, for &s;ome had one, and &s;ome the other, they would come on &s;hore, and trade with them for whatever they would bring: they agreed, but it was only upon condition that we &s;hould leave behind us our mu&s;quets: this was a condition which, however equitable it might appear, could not be com|plied with, nor indeed would it have put the two parties upon an equality, except their numbers had been equal. Here then the negociation &s;eemed to be at an end; but in a little time they ventured to come nearer to the boat, and at la&s;t came near enough to trade, which they did very fairly, for a &s;mall quantity of their cloth, and &s;ome of their weapons; but as they gave our people no hope of provi&s;ions, nor indeed any thing el&s;e except they would venture through a narrow chan|nel to the &s;hore, which, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, they did not think it prudent to do, they put off the boat and left them.</P>
<P>With the &s;hip and the boat we had now made the circuit of the i&s;land, and finding that there was neither harbour nor an|chorage about it, and that the ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition of the people would render landing impracticable, without blood&s;hed, I de|termined not to attempt it, having no motive that could ju&s;|tify the ri&s;k of life.</P>
<P>The bay which the boat entered lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, the bottom was foul and rocky, but the water &s;o clear that it could plainly be &s;een at the depth of five and twenty fathom, which is one hundred and fifty feet.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is &s;ituated in the latitude of 22&deg; 27&prime; S. and in the longitude of 150&deg; 47&prime; W. from the meridian of Green|wich. It is thirteen miles in circuit, and rather high than low, but neither populous nor fertile in proportion to the other i&s;lands that we had &s;een in the&s;e &s;eas. The chief produce
<PB N="174" REF="013324_0201_0F9050C00D7A39D0">
&s;eems to be the tree of which they make their weapons, called in their language <HI>Etoa;</HI> many plantations of it were &s;een along the &s;hore, which is not &s;urrounded, like the neighbouring i&s;lands, by a reef.</P>
<P>The people &s;eemed to be lu&s;ty and well-made, rather brow|ner than tho&s;e we had left: under their arm-pits they had black marks, about as broad as the hand, the edges of which formed not a &s;trait but indented line; they had al&s;o circles of the &s;ame colour, but not &s;o broad, round their arms and legs, but were not marked on any other part of the body.</P>
<P>Their dre&s;s was very different from any that we had &s;een before, as well as the cloth of which it was made. The cloth was of the &s;ame materiaals as that which is worn in the other i&s;lands, and mo&s;t of that which was &s;een by our people was dyed of a bright but deep yellow, and covered on the out&s;ide with a compo&s;ition like varni&s;h, which was either red, or of a dark lead-colour; over this ground it was again painted in &s;tripes of many different patterns, with wonderful regularity, in the manner of our &s;triped &s;ilks in England; the cloth that was painted red was &s;triped with black, and that which was painted lead-colour with white. Their habit was a &s;hort jacket of this cloth, which reached about as low as their knees; it was of one piece, and had no other making than a hole in the middle of it, &s;titched round with long &s;titches, in which it differed from all that we had &s;een before: through this hole the head was put, and what hung down was con|fined to their bodies by a piece of yellow cloth, or &s;a&s;h, which pa&s;&s;ing round the neck behind, was cro&s;&s;ed upon the brea&s;t, and then collected round the wai&s;t like a belt, which pa&s;&s;ed over another belt of red cloth, &s;o that they made a very gay and warlike appearance; &s;ome had caps of the feathers of the tropic bird, which have been before de&s;cribed, and &s;ome had a piece of white or lead-coloured cloth wound about the head like a &s;mall turban, which our people thought more becom|ing.</P>
<P>Their arms were long lances, made of the Etoa, the wood of which is very hard; they were well poli&s;hed and &s;harpened at one end: &s;ome were near twenty feet long, though not more than three fingers thick: they had al&s;o a weapon which was both club and pike, made of the &s;ame wood, about &s;even feet long; this al&s;o was well poli&s;hed, and &s;harpened at one end into a broad point. As a guard again&s;t the&s;e weapons, when they attack each other, they have mats folded up many times, which they place under their clothes, from the neck to the wai&s;t: the weapons them&s;elves indeed are capable of much le&s;s mi&s;chief than tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind, which we &s;aw at the other i&s;lands, for the lances were there pointed with the &s;harp bone of the &s;ting-ray that is called the &s;ting, and the
<PB N="175" REF="013324_0202_0F90F2B52F53E7E0">
pikes were of much greater weight. The other things that we &s;aw here were all &s;uperior in their kind to any we had &s;een be|fore; the cloth was of better colour in the dye, and painted with greater neatne&s;s and ta&s;te; the clubs were better cut and poli&s;hed, and the canoe, though a &s;mall one, was very rich in ornament, and the carving was executed in a better man|ner: among other decorations peculiar to this canoe, was a line of &s;mall white feathers, which hung from the head and &s;tern on the out&s;ide, and which, when we &s;aw them, were thoroughly wetted by the &s;pray.</P>
<P>Tupia told us, that there were &s;everal i&s;lands lying at dif|ferent di&s;tances, and in different directions from this, between the &s;outh and the north we&s;t; and that at the di&s;tance of 3 day's &s;ail to the north-ea&s;t, there was an i&s;land called MANUA, bird-i&s;land: he &s;eemed, however, mo&s;t de&s;irous that we &s;hould &s;ail to the we&s;tward, and de&s;cribed &s;everal i&s;lands in that direction, which he &s;aid he had vi&s;ited; he told us that he had been ten or twelve days in going thither, and thirty in coming back, and that the <HI>Pahie</HI> in which he had made the voyage, &s;ailed much fa&s;ter than the &s;hip: reckoning his Pahie therefore to go at the rate of forty leagues a day, which from my own ob&s;ervation I have great rea&s;on to think the&s;e boats will do, it would make four hundred leagues in ten days, which I compute to be the di&s;tance of Bo&s;cawen and Keppel's i&s;lands, di&s;covered by Captain Wallis, we&s;tward of Ulietea, and therefore think it very probable that they were the i&s;lands he had vi&s;ited. The farthe&s;t i&s;land that he knew any thing of to the &s;outhward, he &s;aid, lay at the di&s;tance of about two days &s;ail from Oteroah, and was called MOUTOU; but he &s;aid that his father had told him there were i&s;lands to the &s;outh|ward of that: upon the whole, I was determined to &s;tand &s;outhward, in &s;earch of a continent, but to &s;pend no time in &s;earching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> did not happen to fall in with them during <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Pa&s;&s;age from Oteroah to New-Zealand; Incidents which happened on going a-&s;hore there, and while the Ship lay in Poverty-Bay.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;ailed from Oteroah on the 15th of Augu&s;t, and on Friday the 25th we celebrated the anniver&s;ary of our leaving England, by taking a Che&s;hire chee&s;e from a locker, where it had been carefully trea&s;ured up for this occa&s;ion, and tapping a ca&s;k of porter, which proved to be very good, and in excellent order. On the 29th, one of the &s;ailors got &s;o drunk, that the next morning he died: we thought at fir&s;t that he could not have come hone&s;tly by the liquor, but we after|wards learnt that the boat&s;wain, who&s;e mate he was, had in mere good-nature given him part of a bottle of rum.</P>
<P>On the 30th we &s;aw the comet; at one o'clock in the morn|ing it was a little above the horizon in the ea&s;tern part of the heavens; at about half an hour after four it pa&s;&s;ed the meridian, and its tail &s;ubtended an angle of forty-two degrees. Our la|titude was 38&deg; 20&prime; S, our longitude, by log, 147&deg; 6&prime; W. and the variation of the needle, by the azimuth, 7&deg; 9&prime; E. Among others that ob&s;erved the comet, was Tupia, who in&s;tantly cried out, that as &s;oon as it &s;hould be &s;een by the people of Bolabola, they would kill the inhabitants of Ulietea, who would with the utmo&s;t precipitation fly to the mountains.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of September, being in the latitude of 40&deg; 22&prime; S. and longitude 174&deg; 29&prime; W. and there not being any &s;igns of land, with a heavy &s;ea from the we&s;tward, and &s;trong gales, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wore, and &s;tood back to the northward, fearing that we might receive &s;uch damage in our &s;ails and rigging, as would hinder the pro&s;ecution of the voyage.</P>
<P>On the next day, there being &s;trong gales to the we&s;tward,
<PB N="177" REF="013324_0204_0F90F2B9D1B33448">
I brought to, with the &s;hip's head to the northward; but in the morning of the third, the wind being more moderate, we loo&s;ened the reef of the main&s;ail, &s;et the top-&s;ails, and plied to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>We continued our cour&s;e till the 19th, when our latitude being 29&deg; and our longitude 159&deg; 29&prime;, we ob&s;erved the varia|tion to be 8&deg; 32&prime; E. On the 24th, being in latitude 33&deg; 18&prime; longitude 162&deg; 51&prime;, we ob&s;erved a &s;mall piece of &s;ea wood, and a piece of wood covered with barnacles: the variation here was 10&deg; 48&prime; E.</P>
<P>On the 27th, being in latitude 28&deg; 59&prime;, longitude 169&deg; 5&prime;, we &s;aw a &s;eal a&s;leep upon the water, and &s;everal bunches of &s;ea weed. The next day we &s;aw more &s;ea weed in bunches, and on the 29th, a bird, which we thought a land bird, it &s;omewhat re&s;embled a &s;nipe, but had a &s;hort bill. On the fir&s;t of October, we &s;aw birds innumerable, and another &s;eal a&s;leep upon the water; it is a general opinion that &s;eals never go out of &s;oundings, or far from land, but tho&s;e that we &s;aw in the&s;e &s;eas prove the contrary. Rock-weed is, however, a certain indication that land is not far di&s;tant. The next day, it being calm, we hoi&s;ted out the boat, to try whether there was a cur|rent, but found none. Our latitude was 37&deg; 10&prime;, longitude 172&deg; 54&prime; W. On the 3d, being in latitude 36&deg; 56&prime;, longitude 173&deg; 27&prime;, we took up more &s;ea weed, and another piece of wood covered with barnacles. The next day we &s;aw two more &s;eals, and a brown bird, about as big as a raven, with &s;ome white feathers under the wing. Mr. Gore told us, that birds of this kind were &s;een in great numbers about Falkland's-i&s;lands, and our people gave them the name of Port-Egmont hens.</P>
<P>On the 5th, we thought the water changed colour, but upon ca&s;ting the lead, had no ground with 180 fathom. In the evening of this day, the variation was 12&deg; 50&prime; E. and while were going nine leagues it increa&s;ed to 14&deg; 2&prime;.</P>
<P>On the next day, Friday, October the 6th, we &s;aw land from the ma&s;t-head, bearing W. by N. and &s;tood directly for it; in the evening it could be ju&s;t di&s;cerned from the deck, and ap|peared large. The variation this day, was by azimuth and amplitude, 15&deg; 4&prime; &frac12; E. and by ob&s;ervation made of the &s;un and moon, the longitude of the &s;hip appeared to be 180&deg; 55&prime; W. and by the medium of this and &s;ub&s;equent ob&s;ervations, there appeared to be an error in the &s;hip's account of longitude during her run from Otaheite of 3&deg; 16&prime;, &s;he being &s;o much to the we&s;t|ward of the longitude re&s;ulting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">am the log. At midnight, I brought to and &s;ounded, but had no ground with one hundred and &s;eventy fathom.</P>
<P>On the 7th, it fell calm, we therefore approached the land &s;lowly, and in the afternoon, when a breeze &s;prung up, we were &s;till di&s;tant &s;even or eight leagues. It appeared &s;till larger
<PB N="178" REF="013324_0205_0F8FFB9A7B4E6368">
as it was more di&s;tinctly &s;een, with four or five ranges of hills, ri&s;ing one over the other, and a chain of mountains above all, which appeared to be of an enormous height. This land became the &s;ubject of much eager conver&s;ation; but the general opinion &s;eemed to be that we had found the <HI>Terra au&s;tralis incognita.</HI> About five o'clock we &s;aw the opening of a bay, which &s;eemed to run pretty far inland, upon which we hauled our wind and &s;tood in for it; we al&s;o &s;aw &s;moke a&s;cending from different places on &s;hore. When night came on, however, we kept plying off and on till day-light, when we found our&s;elves to the lee|ward of the bay, the wind being at North: we could now perceive that the hills were clothed with wood, and that &s;ome of the trees in the valleys were very large. By noon we fetched in with the &s;outh we&s;t point; but not being able to weather it, tacked and &s;tood off: at this time we &s;aw &s;everal canoes &s;tand|ing acro&s;s the bay, which in a little time made to &s;hore, without &s;eeming to take the lea&s;t notice of the &s;hip; we al&s;o &s;aw &s;ome hou&s;es, which appeared to be &s;mall, but neat; and near one of them a con&s;iderable number of the people collected to|gether, who were &s;itting upon the beach, and who, we thought, were the &s;ame that we had &s;een in the canoes. Upon a &s;mall penin&s;ula, at the north ea&s;t head, we could plainly perceive a pretty high and regular paling, which inclo&s;ed the whole top of a hill; this was al&s;o the &s;ubject of much &s;peculation, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ing it to be a park of deer, others an inclo&s;ure for oxen and &s;heep. About four o'clock in the afternoon, we anchored on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the bay, before the entrance of a &s;mall river, in ten fathom water, with a fine &s;andy bottom, and at about half a league from the &s;hore. The &s;ides of the bay are white cliffs of a great height; the middle is low land, with hills gradually ri&s;ing behind, one towering above another, and terminating in the chain of mountains which appeared to be far inland.</P>
<P>In the evening I went on &s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with the pinnace and yawl, and a party of men. We landed abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, which was here about forty yards broad; but &s;eeing &s;ome natives on the we&s;t &s;ide whom I wi&s;hed to &s;peak with, and find|ing the river not fordable, I ordered the yawl in to carry us over, and left the pinnace at the entrance. When we came near the place where the people were a&s;&s;embled, they all ran away; however, we landed, and leaving four boys to take care of the yawl, we walked up to &s;ome huts which were about two or three hundred yards from the water &s;ide. When we had got &s;ome di&s;tance from the boat, four men, armed with long lances, ru&s;hed out of the woods, and running up to attack the boat, would certainly have cut her off, if the people in the pin|nace had not di&s;covered them, and called to the boys to drop

down the &s;tream: the boys in&s;tantly obeyed; but being clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the Indians, the cock&s;wain of the pinnace, who had the charge of the boats, fired a mu&s;quet over their heads; at this they &s;topped and looked round, but in a few minutes re|newed the pur&s;uit, brandi&s;hing their lances in a threatening manner: the cock&s;wain then fired a &s;econd mu&s;quet over their heads, but of this they took no notice; and one of them lift|ing up his &s;pear to dart it at the boat, another piece was fired, which &s;hot him dead. When he fell, the other three &s;tood motionle&s;s for &s;ome minutes, as if petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment; as &s;oon as they recovered, they went back, dragging after them the dead body, which however they &s;oon le&s;t, that it might not incumber their flight. At the report of the fir&s;t mu&s;quet we drew together, having &s;traggled to a little di&s;tance from each other, and made the be&s;t of our way back to the boat; and cro&s;&s;ing the river, we &s;oon &s;aw the Indian lying dead upon the ground. Upon examining the body, we found that he had been &s;hot through the heart: he was a man of the middle &s;ize and &s;tat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">; his complexion was brown, but not very dark; and one &s;ide of his face was tattowed in &s;piral lines of a very regular figure: he was covered with a fine cloth, of a manufac|ture altogether new to us, and it was tied on exactly according to the repre&s;entation in Valentyn's account of Abel Ta&s;man's voyage, vol. iii. part 2. page 50; his hair al&s;o was tied in a knot on the top of his head, but had no feather in it. We re|turned immediately to the &s;hip, where we could hear the people on &s;hore talking with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and in a very loud tone, probably about what had happened, and what &s;hould be done.</P>
<P>In the morning, we &s;aw &s;everal of the natives where they had been &s;een the night before, and &s;ome walking with a quick pace towards the place where we had landed, mo&s;t of them unarmed; but three or four with long pikes in their hands. As I was de&s;irous to e&s;tabli&s;h an intercour&s;e with them, I or|dered three boats to be manned with &s;eamen and marines, and proceeded towards the &s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, the other gentlemen, and Tupia; about fifty of them &s;eemed to wait for our landing, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, which we thought a &s;ign of fear, and &s;eated them|&s;elves upon the ground; at fir&s;t therefore, my&s;elf, with only Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia, landed from the little boat, and advanced towards them; but we had not proceeded many paces before they all &s;tarted up, and every man produced either a long pike, or a &s;mall weapon of green Tale, extremely well poli&s;hed, about a foot long, and thick enough to weigh four or five pounds: Tupia called to them in the language of Otaheite; but they an&s;wered only by flouri&s;hing their weapons, and making &s;igns to us to depart; a mu&s;quet was then fired wide of them, and the ball &s;truck the water, the river being
<PB N="180" REF="013324_0207_0F90F2BA84FDC178">
&s;till between us: they &s;aw the effect, and de&s;i&s;ted from their threats: but we thought it prudent to retreat till the marines could be landed. This was &s;oon done; and they marched with a jack carried before them, to a little bank, about fifty yards from the water &s;ide; here they were drawn up, and I again advanced, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander; Mr, Green and Mr. Monkhou&s;e being with us. Tupia was again directed to &s;peak to them, and it was with great plea|&s;ure that we perceived he was perfectly under&s;tood, he and the natives &s;peaking only different dialects of the &s;ame language. He told them that we wanted provi&s;ion and water, and would give them iron in exchange, the properties of which he ex|plained as well as he was able. They were willing to trade, and de&s;ired that we would come over to them for that purpo&s;e: to this we con&s;ented, provided they would lay by their arms; which, however, they could by no means be per&s;uaded to do. During this conver&s;ation, Tupia warned us to be upon our guard, for they were not our friends: we then pre&s;&s;ed them in our turn to come over to us; and at la&s;t one of them &s;tripped him&s;elf, and &s;wam over without his arms: he was almo&s;t im|mediately followed by two more, and &s;oon after by mo&s;t of the re&s;t, to the number of twenty or thirty; but the&s;e brought their arms with them. We made them all pre&s;ents of iron and beads, but they &s;eemed to &s;et little value upon either, particu|larly the iron, not having the lea&s;t idea of its u&s;e; &s;o that we got nothing in return but a few feathers: they offered indeed to exchange their arms for ours, and when we refu&s;ed, made many attempts to &s;natch them out of our hands. As &s;oon as they came over, Tupia repeated his declaration, that they were not our friends, and again warned us to be upon our guard; their attempts to &s;natch our weapons, therefore, did not &s;ucceed; and we gave them to under&s;tand by Tupia, that we &s;hould be obliged to kill them if they offered any farther violence. In a few minutes, however, Mr. Green happening to turn about, one of them &s;natched away his hanger, and re|tiring to a little di&s;tance, waved it round his head, with a &s;hout of exultation: the re&s;t now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be extremely in&s;olent, and we &s;aw more coming to join them from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river. It was therefore become nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;s them, and Mr. Banks fired at the man who had taken the hanger with &s;mall &s;hot, at the di&s;tance of about fifteen yards; when the &s;hot &s;truck him, he cea&s;ed his cry; but in&s;tead of returning the hanger, continued to flouri&s;h it over his head, at the &s;ame time &s;lowly retreating to a greater di&s;tance. Mr. Monkhou&s;e &s;eeing this, fired at him with ball, and he in&s;tantly dropped. Upon this the main body, who had retired to a rock in the middle of the river upon the fir&s;t di&s;charge, began to return; two that were near to the man who had been killed, ran up to
<PB N="181" REF="013324_0208_0F8FFB9B534EB020">
the body, one &s;eized his weapon of green Talc, and the other endeavoured to &s;ecure the hanger, which Mr. Monkhou&s;e had but ju&s;t time to prevent. As all that had retired to the rock were now advancing, three of us di&s;charged our pieces, loaded only with &s;mall &s;hot, upon which they &s;wam back to the &s;hore; and we perceived, upon their landing, that two or three of them were wounded. They retired &s;lowly up the country, and we reimbarked in our boats.</P>
<P>As we had unhappily experienced that nothing was to be done with the&s;e people at this pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and finding the water in the river to be &s;alt, I proceeded in the boats round the head of the bay in &s;earch of fre&s;h-water, and with a de&s;ign, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;urprize &s;ome of the natives, and take them on board, where by kind treatment and pre&s;ents I might obtain their friend&s;hip, and by their means e&s;tabli&s;h an amicable corre&s;pondence with their countrymen.</P>
<P>To my great regret, I found no place where I could land, a dangerous &s;urf every where beating upon the &s;hore; but I &s;aw two canoes coming in from the &s;ea, one under &s;ail, and the other worked with paddles. I thought this a favourable opportunity to get &s;ome of the people into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without mi&s;chief, as tho&s;e in the canoe were probably fi&s;hermen and without arms, and I had three boats full of men. I therefore di&s;po&s;ed the boats &s;o as mo&s;t effectually to intercept them in their way to the &s;hore; the people in the canoe that was pad|dled perceived us &s;o &s;oon, that by making to the neare&s;t land with their utmo&s;t &s;trength, they e&s;caped us; the other &s;ailed on till &s;he was in the mid&s;t of us, without di&s;cerning what we were; but the moment &s;he di&s;covered us, the people on board &s;truck their &s;ail, and took to their paddles, which they plied &s;o bri&s;kly that &s;he out-ran the boat. They were however within hearing, and Tupia called out to them to come along-&s;ide, and promi&s;ed for us that they &s;hould come to no hurt: they choo&s;e, however, rather to tru&s;t to their paddles than our promi&s;es, and continued to make from us with all their power. I then ordered a mu&s;quet to be fired over their heads, as the lea&s;t ex|ceptionable expedient to accompli&s;h my de&s;ign, hoping it would either make them &s;urrender or leap into the water. Upon the di&s;charge of the piece, they cea&s;ed paddling; and all of them, being &s;even in number, began to &s;trip, as we imagined to jump over board; but it happened otherwi&s;e. They immediately formed a re&s;olution not to fly, but to fight; and when the boat came up, they began the attack with their paddles, and with &s;tones and other offen&s;ive weapons that were in the boat, &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that we were obliged to fire upon them in our defence: four were unhappily killed, and the other three who were boys, the elde&s;t about nineteen, and the younge&s;t about eleven, in&s;tantly leaped into the water; the
<PB N="182" REF="013324_0209_0F8FFB9C3A6D1F70">
elde&s;t &s;wam with great vigour, and re&s;i&s;ted the attempts of our people to take him into the boat by every effort that he could make; he was however at la&s;t overpowered, and the other 2 were taken up with le&s;s difficulty. I am con&s;cious that the feeling of every reader of humanity will cen&s;ure me for having fired upon the&s;e unhappy people, and it is impo&s;&s;ible that, upon a calm review, I &s;hould approve it my&s;elf. They certainly did not de&s;erve death for not chu&s;ing to confide in my promi&s;es; or not con&s;enting to come on board my boat, even if they had apprehended no danger; but the nature of my &s;ervice required me to obtain a knowledge of their country, which I could no otherwi&s;e effect than by forcing my way into it in a ho&s;tile manner, or gaining admi&s;&s;ion through the confidence and good will of the people. I had already tried the power of pre&s;ents without effect; and I was now prompted, by my de&s;ire to avoid further ho&s;tilities, to get &s;ome of them on board, as the only method left of convincing them that we intended them no harm, and had it in our power to contribute to their gratifica|tion and convenience. Thus far my intentions certainly were not criminal; and though in the conte&s;t, which I had not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect, our victory might have been complete without &s;o great an expence of life; yet in &s;uch &s;ituations, when the command to fire has been given, no man can re&s;train its exce&s;s, or pre&s;cribe its effect.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the poor wretches whom we had taken out of the water were in the boat, they &s;quatted down, expecting no doubt in&s;tantly to be put to death: we made ha&s;te to convince them of the contrary, by every method in our power; we fur|ni&s;hed them with clothes, and gave them every other te&s;timony of kindne&s;s that could remove their fears and engage their good will. Tho&s;e who are acquainted with human nature will not wonder, that the &s;udden joy of the&s;e young &s;avages at being unexpectedly delivered from the fear of death, and kindly treated by tho&s;e whom they &s;uppo&s;ed would have been their in&s;tant executioners, &s;urmounted their concern for the friends they had loft, and was &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in their countenances and behaviour. Before we reached the &s;hip, their &s;u&s;picions and fears being wholly removed, they appeared to be not only reconciled to their &s;ituation but in high &s;pirits, and upon being offered &s;ome bread when they came on board, they devoured it with a voracious appetite. They an&s;wered and a&s;ked many que&s;tions, with great appearance of plea&s;ure and curio&s;ity; and when our dinner came, they expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to ta&s;te every thing that they &s;aw; they &s;eemed be&s;t plea&s;ed with the &s;alt pork, though we had other provi&s;ions upon the table. At &s;un-&s;et, they eat another meal with great eagerne&s;s, each de|vouring a large quantity of bread, and drinking above a quart of water. We then made them beds upon the lockers, and
<PB N="183" REF="013324_0210_0F8FFB9D62F6B2E8">
they went to &s;leep with great &s;eeming content. In the night, however, the tumult of their minds having &s;ub&s;ided, and given way to reflection, they &s;ighed often and loud. Tupia, who was always upon the watch to comfort them, got up, and by &s;oothing and encouragement made them not only ea&s;y but cheerful; their cheerfulne&s;s was encouraged &s;o that they &s;ung a &s;ong with a degree of ta&s;te that &s;urpri&s;ed us: the tune was &s;olemn and &s;low, like tho&s;e of our p&s;alms, containing many notes and &s;emitones. Their countenances were intelligent and expre&s;&s;ive, and the middlemo&s;t; who &s;eemed to be about fifteen, had an openne&s;s in his a&s;pect, and an ea&s;e in his deportment which were very &s;triking: we found that the two elde&s;t were brothers, and that their names were Taahourange and Koike|range; the name of the younge&s;t was Maragovete. As we were returning to the &s;hip, after having taken the&s;e boys into the boat, we picked up a large piece of pummice &s;tone floating upon the water; a &s;ure &s;ign that there either is; or has been a volcano in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P>In the morning, they all &s;eemed to be cheerful, and eat another enormous meal; after this we dre&s;&s;ed them, and adorned them with bracelets, ancklets, and necklaces, after their own fa&s;hion, and the boat being hoi&s;ted out, they were told that we were going to &s;et them a&s;hore: this produced a tran&s;port of joy; but upon perceiving that we made towards our fir&s;t landing place near the river, their countenances changed, and they entreated with great earne&s;tne&s;s that they might not be &s;et a&s;hore at that place, becau&s;e they &s;aid, it was inhabited by their enemies, who would kill them and eat them. This was a great di&s;appointment to me; becau&s;e I hoped the report and appearance of the boys would procure a favourable reception for our&s;elves. I had already &s;ent an officer on &s;hore with the marines and a party of men to cut wood, and I was determined to land near the place; not however to abandon the boys, if, when we got a&s;hore, they &s;hould be unwilling to leave us; but to &s;end a boat with them in the evening to that part of the bay to which they pointed, and which they called their home. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander and Tupia were with me, and upon our landing with the boys, and cro&s;&s;ing the river, they &s;eemed at fir&s;t to be unwilling to leave us; but at length they &s;uddenly changed their mind, and, though not without a manife&s;t &s;truggle, and &s;ome tears, they took their leave: when they were gone, we proceeded along a &s;wamp, with a de&s;ign to &s;hoot &s;ome ducks, of which we &s;aw great plenty, and four of the marines attended us, walking abrea&s;t of us upon a bank that overlooked the country. After we had advanced about a mile, the&s;e men called out to us and told us, that a large body of the Indians were in &s;ight, and advancing at a great rate. Upon receiving this intelligence, we drew to|gether,
<PB N="184" REF="013324_0211_0F8FFB9DC49877C8">
and re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of our way to the boats; we had &s;carcely began to put this into execution, when the 3 Indian boys &s;tarted &s;uddenly from &s;ome bu&s;hes, where they had concealed them&s;elves, and again claimed our protection: we readily received them, and repairing to the beach as the cleare&s;t place, we walked bri&s;kly towards the boats. The Indians were in two bodies; one ran along the bank which had been quitted by the marines, the other fetched a compa&s;s by the &s;wamp &s;o that we could not &s;ee them: when they perceived that we had formed into one body, they &s;lackened their pace, but &s;till followed us in a gentle walk: that they &s;lackened their pace, was for us, as well as for them, a fortunate circum&s;tance; for when we came to the &s;ide of river, where we expected to find the boats that were to carry us over to the wooders, we found the pinnace at lea&s;t a mile from her &s;tation, having been &s;ent to pick up a bird which had been &s;hot by the officer on &s;hore, and the little boat was obliged to make three trips be|fore we could all get over to the re&s;t of the party. As &s;oon as we were drawn up on the other &s;ide, the Indians came down, not in a body as we expected, but by two or three at a time; all armed, and in a &s;hort time their number increa&s;ed to about two hundred: as we now de&s;paired of making peace with them, &s;eeing that the dread of our &s;mall arms did not keep them at a di&s;tance, and that the &s;hip was too far off to reach the place with a &s;hot, we re&s;olved to re-imbark, le&s;t our &s;tay &s;hould em|broil us in another quarrel, and co&s;t more of the Indians their lives. We therefore advanced towards the pinnace which was now returning, when one of the boys &s;uddenly cried out, that his uncle was among the people who had marched down to us, and de&s;ired us to &s;tay and talk with them: we complied, and a parley immediately commenced between them and Tupia; during which the boys held up every thing we had given them as tokens of our kindne&s;s and liberality; but neither would either of the boys &s;wim over to them, or any of them to the boys. The body of the man who had been killed the day be|fore, &s;till lay expo&s;ed upon the beach; the boys &s;eeing it lie very near us, went up to it, and covered it with &s;ome of the clothes that we had given them; and &s;oon after a &s;ingle man, unarmed, who proved to be the uncle of Maragovete, the younge&s;t of the boys, &s;wam over to us, bringing in his hand a green branch, which we &s;uppo&s;ed, as well here as at Otaheite, to be an emblem of peace. We received his branch by the hands of Tupia, to whom he gave it, and made him many pre&s;ents; we al&s;o invited him to go on board the &s;hip, but he declined it; we therefore left him, and expected that his ne|phew, and the two other young Indians would have &s;taid with him, but to our great &s;urprize they cho&s;e rather to go with us As &s;oon as we had retired, he went and gathered another
<PB N="185" REF="013324_0212_0F90F2BBF38BBD60">
green branch, and with this in his hand, he approached the dead body which the youth had covered with part of his clothes, walking &s;ideways, with many ceremonies, and then throwing it towards him. When this was done, he returned to his companions, who had &s;at down upon the &s;and to ob&s;erve the i&s;&s;ue of his negociation: they immediately gathered round him, and continued in a body above an hour, without &s;eeming to take any farther notice of us. We were more curious than they, and ob&s;erving them with our gla&s;&s;es from on board the &s;hip, we &s;aw &s;ome of them cro&s;s the river upon a kind of raft, or catamarine, and four of them carry off the dead body which had been covered by the boy, and over which his uncle had performed the ceremony of the branch, upon a kind of bier, between four men: the other body was &s;till &s;uffered to remain where it had been fir&s;t left.</P>
<P>After dinner, I directed Tupia to a&s;k the boys, if they had now any objection to going a&s;hore, where we had left their uncle, the body having been carried off, which we under&s;tood was a ratification of peace: they &s;aid, they had not; and the boat being ordered, they went into it with great alacrity: when the boat, in which I had &s;ent two mid&s;hipmen, came to land, they went willingly a&s;hore; but &s;oon after &s;he put off, they returned to the rocks, and wading into the water, earne&s;tly entreated to be taken on board again; but the people in the boat, having po&s;itive orders to leave them, could not comply. We were very attentive to what happened on &s;hore, and keeping a con&s;tant watch with our gla&s;&s;es, we &s;aw a man pa&s;s the river upon another raft, and fetch them to a place where forty or fifty of the natives were a&s;&s;embled, who clo&s;ed round them, and continued in the &s;ame place till &s;un&s;et; upon looking again, when we &s;aw them in motion, we could plainly di&s;tingui&s;h our three pri&s;oners, who &s;eparated them&s;elves from the re&s;t, came down to the beach, and having waved their hands three times towards the &s;hip, ran nimbly back and joined their companions, who walked lei&s;urely away towards that part which the boys had pointed to as their dwelling place; we had therefore the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe that no mi&s;chief would happen to them, e&s;pecially as we perceived that they went off in the clothes we had given them.</P>
<P>After it was dark, loud voices were heard on &s;hore in the bottom of the bay as u&s;ual, of which we could never learn the meaning.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A De&s;cription of Poverty Bay, and the Face of the adjacent Country. The Range from thence to Cape Turnagain, and back to Tolaga; with &s;ome Account of the People and the Country, and &s;everal Incidents that happened on that part of the Coa&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning at &s;ix o'clock, we weighed, and &s;tood away from this unfortunate and inho&s;pitable place, to which I gave the name of Poverty Bay, and which by the natives is called Taoneroa or Long Sand, as it did not afford us a &s;ingle article that we wanted except a little wood. It lies in latitude 38&deg; 42&prime; S. and longitude 181&deg; 36&prime; W; it is in the form of an hor&s;e-&s;hoe, and is known by an i&s;land lying clo&s;e under the north ea&s;t point: the two points which form the entrance are high, with &s;teep white cliffs, and lie a league and a half or two leagues from each other, N. E. by E. and S. W. by W. the depth of water in the bay is from twelve to five fathom, with a &s;andy bottom and good anchorage; but the &s;ituation is open to the wind between the &s;outh and ea&s;t: boats can go in and out of the river at any time of the tide in fine weather; but as there is a bar at the entrance, no boat can go either in or out when the &s;ea runs high: the be&s;t place to at|tempt it, is on the north ea&s;t &s;ide, and it is there practicable when it is not &s;o in any other part. The &s;hore of the bay, a little within its entrance, is a low flat &s;and; behind which, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, the face of the country is finely diver&s;ified by hills and valleys, all clothed with wood, and covered with verdure. The country al&s;o appears to be well inhabited, e&s;|pecially in the valleys leading up from the bay, where we daily &s;aw &s;moke ri&s;ing in clouds one behind another to a great di&s;tance, till the view terminated in mountains of a &s;tupendous height.</P>
<P>The &s;outh we&s;t point of the bay I named Young Nick's Head, after Nicholas Young, the boy who fir&s;t &s;aw the land; at noon, it bore N. W. by W. di&s;tant about three or four leagues, and we were then about three miles from the &s;hore. The main land extended from N. E. by N. to &s;outh, and I propo&s;ed to follow the direction of the coa&s;t to the &s;outhward as far as the latitude of 40 or 41; and then, if I met with no encourage|ment to proceed farther, to return to the northward.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we lay becalmed, which the people on &s;hore perceiving, &s;everal canoes put off, and came within le&s;s than a quarter of a mile of the ve&s;&s;el; but could not be per|&s;uaded to come nearer, though Tupia exerted all the powers of his lungs and his eloquence upon the occa&s;ion, &s;houting, and
<PB N="187" REF="013324_0214_0F90F2BCCC14CDD0">
promi&s;ing that they &s;hould not be hurt. Another canoe was now &s;een coming from Poverty Bay, with only four people on board, one of whom we well remembered to have &s;een in our fir&s;t interview upon the rock. This canoe, without &s;topping or taking the lea&s;t notice of the others, came directly along &s;ide of the &s;hip, and with very little per&s;ua&s;ion, we got the Indians on board. Their example was &s;oon followed by the re&s;t, and we had about us &s;even canoes, and about fifty men. We made them all pre&s;ents with a liberal hand; notwith|&s;tanding which, they were &s;o de&s;irous to have more of our commodities, that they &s;old us every thing they had, even the clothes from their backs, and the paddles from their boats. There were but two weapons among them, the&s;e were the in|&s;truments of green talc, which were &s;haped &s;omewhat like a pointed battledore, with a &s;hort handle and &s;harp edges; they were called <HI>Patoo-Patoo,</HI> and were well contrived for clo&s;e-fighting, as they would certainly &s;plit the thicke&s;t &s;cull at a &s;ingle blow.</P>
<P>When the&s;e people had recovered from the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of fear, which notwith&s;tanding their re&s;olution in coming on board, had manife&s;tly thrown them into &s;ome confu&s;ion, we enquired after our poor boys. The man who fir&s;t came on board immediately an&s;wered, that they were unhurt and at home; adding, that they had been induced to venture on board by the account which they had given of the kindne&s;s with which they had been treated, and the wonders that were contained in the &s;hip.</P>
<P>While they were on board they &s;hewed every &s;ign of friend|&s;hip, and invited us very cordially to go back to our old bay, or to a &s;mall cove, which they pointed out, that was not quite &s;o far off; but I cho&s;e rather to pro&s;ecute my di&s;coveries than go back, having rea&s;on to hope that I &s;hould find a better harbour than any I had yet &s;een.</P>
<P>About an hour before &s;un-&s;et, the canoes put off from the &s;hip, with the few paddles they had re&s;erved, which were &s;carcely &s;ufficient to &s;et them on &s;hore; but by &s;ome means or other three of their people were left behind; as &s;oon as we di&s;covered it, we hailed them; but not one of them would re|turn to take them on board; this greatly &s;urpri&s;ed us; but we were &s;urpri&s;ed &s;till more to ob&s;erve that the de&s;erted Indians did not &s;eem at all unea&s;y at their &s;ituation, but entertained us with dancing and &s;inging after their manner, eat their &s;up|pers, and went quietly to bed.</P>
<P>A light breeze &s;pringing up &s;oon after it was dark, we &s;teered along the &s;hore under an ea&s;y &s;ail till midnight, and then brought to, &s;oon after which it fell calm; we were now &s;ome leagues di&s;tant from the place where the canoes had left us, and at day-break, when the Indians perceived it, they
<PB N="188" REF="013324_0215_0F90F2BD8B784F50">
were &s;eized with con&s;ternation and terror, and lamented their &s;ituation in loud complaints, with ge&s;tures of de&s;pair and ma|ny tears. Tupia, with great difficulty, pacified them; and about &s;even o'clock in the morning, a light breeze &s;pringing up, we continued to &s;tand &s;outh we&s;t along the &s;hore. Fortu|nately for our poor Indians, two canoes came off about this time, and made towards the &s;hip; they &s;topped, however, at a little di&s;tance, and &s;eemed unwilling to tru&s;t them&s;elves nearer. Our Indians were greatly agitated in this &s;tate of un|certainty, and urged their fellows to come along &s;ide of the &s;hip, both by their voice and ge&s;tures, with the utmo&s;t eager|ne&s;s and impatience. Tupia interpreted what they &s;aid, and we were much &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that among other arguments, they a&s;&s;ured the people in the canoes, we did not eat men. We now began &s;eriou&s;ly to believe that this horrid cu&s;tom pre|vailed among them; for what the boys had &s;aid, we con|&s;idered as a mere hyperbolical expre&s;&s;ion of their fear. One of the canoes, at length, ventured to come under the &s;hip's &s;ide; and an old man came on board, who &s;eemed to be a chief from the finery of his garment, and the &s;uperiority of his weapon, which was a Patoo-Patoo, made of bone, that, as he &s;aid, had belonged to a whale. He &s;taid on board but a &s;hort time, and when he went away, he took with him our gue&s;ts, very much to the &s;atisfaction both of them and us.</P>
<P>At the time when we &s;ailed, we were abrea&s;t of a point, from which the land trends S. S. W. and which, on account of its figure, I called CAPE TABLE. This point lies &s;even leagues to the &s;outhward of Poverty Bay, in latitude 39&deg; 7&prime; S. and longitude 181&deg; 36&prime; W.: it is of a con&s;iderable height, makes in a &s;hort angle, and appears to be quite flat at the top.</P>
<P>In &s;teering along the &s;hore to the &s;outhward of the Cape, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles, our &s;oundings were from twenty to thirty fathom, having a chain of rocks be|tween us and the &s;hore, which appeared at different heights above the water.</P>
<P>At noon, Cape Table bore N. 20 E. di&s;tant about four leagues, and a &s;mall i&s;land, which was the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight, bore S. 70 W. at the di&s;tance of about three miles. This i&s;land, which the natives call TEAHOWRAY, I named the ILAND OF PORTLAND, from its very great re&s;emblance to Portland in the Engli&s;h channel: it lies about a mile from a point on the main; but there appears to be a ridge of rocks, extending nearly, if not quite, from one to the other. N. 57 E. two miles from the &s;outh point of Portland, lies a &s;unken rock, upon which the &s;ea breaks with great violence We pa&s;&s;ed between this rock and the land, having from &s;e|venteen to twenty fathom.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="013324_0216_0F8FFBA0DA29A990">
In &s;ailing along the &s;hore, we &s;aw the natives a&s;&s;embled in great numbers as well upon Portland I&s;land as the main: we could al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h &s;everal &s;pots of ground that were culti|vated; &s;ome &s;eemed to be fre&s;h turned up, and lay in fur|rows, like plowed land, and &s;ome had plants upon them in different &s;tages of their growth. We &s;aw al&s;o in two places, high rails upon the ridges of hills, like what we had &s;een upon the penin&s;ula at the north ea&s;t head of Poverty bay: as they were ranged i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> lines only, and not &s;o as to enclo&s;e an area, we could not gue&s;s at their u&s;e, and therefore &s;uppo&s;ed they might be the work of &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>About noon another canoe appeared, in which were four men; &s;he came within about a quarter of a mile of us, where the people on board &s;eemed to perform divers ceremonies: one of them, who was in the bow, &s;ometimes &s;eemed to a&s;k and to offer peace, and &s;ometimes to threaten war, by bran|di&s;hing a weapon that he held in his hand: &s;ometimes al&s;o he danced, and &s;ometimes he &s;ung. Tupia talked much to him, but could not per&s;uade him to come to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Between one and two o'clock we di&s;covered land to the we&s;tward of Portland, extending to the &s;outhward as far as we could &s;ee; and as the &s;hip was hauling found the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> end of the i&s;land, &s;he &s;uddenly fell into &s;hoal water, and broken ground: we had indeed always &s;even fathom or more, but the &s;oundings were never twice the &s;ame, jumping at once from &s;even fathom to eleven; in a &s;hort time, however we got clear of all danger, and had again deep water under us.</P>
<P>At this time the i&s;land lay within a mile of us, making in white cliffs, and a long &s;pit of low land running from it to|wards the main. On the &s;ides of the&s;e cliffs &s;at va&s;t numbers of people, looking at us with a fixed attention, and it is pro|bable that they perceived &s;ome appearance of hurry and con|fu&s;ion on board, and &s;ome irregularity in the working of the &s;hip, while we were getting clear of the &s;hallow water and broken ground, from which they might infer that we were alarmed or in di&s;tre&s;s; we thought that they wi&s;hed to take advantage of our &s;ituation, for five canoes were put off with the utmo&s;t expedition, full of men, and well armed: they came &s;o near, and &s;hewed &s;o ho&s;tile a di&s;po&s;ition by &s;houting, brandi&s;hing their lances, and u&s;ing threatening ge&s;tures, that we were in &s;ome pain for our &s;mall boat, which was &s;till em|ployed in &s;ounding: a mu&s;ket was therefore fired over them, but finding it did them no harm, they &s;eemed rather to be provoked than intimidated, and I therefore fired a four pounder, charged with grape-&s;hot, wide of them: this had a better effect; upon the report of the piece they all ro&s;e up and &s;houted, but in&s;tead of continuing the chace, drew altogether, and after a &s;hort con&s;ultation, when quietly away.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="013324_0217_0F8FFBA14E476540">
Having got round Portland, we hauled in for the land N. W. having a gentle breeze at N. E. which about five o'clock died away, and obliged us to anchor; we had one and twen|ty fathom, with a fine &s;andy bottom: the &s;outh point of Port|land bore S. E. &frac12; S. di&s;tant about two leagues, and a low point on the main bore N. &frac12; E.: in the &s;ame direction with this low point, there runs a deep bay, behind the land of which Cape Table is the extremity, &s;o as to make this land a penin&s;ula, leaving only a low narrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eck between that and the main. Of this penin&s;ula, which the natives call TERAKACO, Cape Table is the north point, and Portland the &s;outh.</P>
<P>While we lay at anchor, two more canoes came off to us; one armed, and the other a &s;mall fi&s;hing-boat, with only four men in her; they came &s;o near that they entered into conver&s;ation with Tupia; they an&s;wered all the que&s;tions that he a&s;ked them with great civility, but could not be per|&s;uaded to come on board; they came near enough, however, to receive &s;everal pre&s;ents that were thrown to them from the &s;hip, with which they &s;eemed much plea&s;ed, and went away. During the night many fires were kept upon &s;hore, probably to &s;hew us that the inhabitants were too much upon their guard to be &s;urprized.</P>
<P>About five o'clock in the morning of the 13th, a breeze &s;pringing up northerly, we weighed, and &s;teered in for the land. The &s;hore here forms a large bay, of which Portland is the north ea&s;t point, and the bay that runs behind Cape Table an arm. This arm I had a great inclination to exa|mine, becau&s;e there appeared to be &s;afe anchorage in it, but not being &s;ure of that, and the wind being right an end, I was unwilling to &s;pare the time. Four and twenty fathom was the greate&s;t depth within Portland, but the ground was every where clear. The land hear the &s;hore is of a moderate height, with white cliffs and &s;andy beaches; within it ri&s;es into the mountains, and upon the whole the &s;urface is hilly, for the mo&s;t part covered with wood, and to appearance plea|&s;ant and fertile. In the morning nine canoes came after the &s;hip, but whether with peaceable or ho&s;tile intentions we could not tell, for we &s;oon left them behind us.</P>
<P>In the evening we &s;tood in for a place that had the appear|ance of an opening, but found no harbour; we therefore &s;tood ont again, and were &s;oon followed by a large canoe, with eighteen or twenty men, all armed, who, though they could not reach us, &s;houted defiance, and brandi&s;hed their weapons, with many ge&s;tures of menace and in&s;ult.</P>
<P>In the morning we had a view of the mountains inland, upon which the &s;now was &s;till lying: the country near the &s;hore was low and unfit for culture, but in one place we per|ceived
<PB N="191" REF="013324_0218_0F8FFBA20EB30408">
a patch of &s;omewhat yellow, which had greatly the appearance of a corn field, yet was probably nothing more than &s;ome dead flaggs, which are not uncommon in &s;wampy places: at &s;ome di&s;tance we &s;aw groves of trees, which ap|peared high and tapering, and being not above two leagues from the &s;outh we&s;t cod of the great bay, in which we had been coa&s;ting for the two la&s;t days, I hoi&s;ted out the pinnace and long-boat, to &s;earch for fre&s;h water; but ju&s;t as they were about to put off, we &s;aw &s;everal boats full of people coming from the &s;hore, and therefore I did not think it &s;afe for them to leave the &s;hip. About ten o'clock, five of the&s;e boats having drawn together, as if to hold a con&s;ultation, made towards the &s;hip, having on board between eighty and ninety men, and four more followed at &s;ome di&s;tance, as if to &s;u&s;tain the attack: when the fir&s;t five came within about an hundred yards of the &s;hip, they began to &s;ing their war &s;ong, and brandi&s;hing their pikes, prepared for an engagement. We had now no time to lo&s;e, for if we could not prevent the at|tack, we &s;hould come under the unhappy nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing our fire-arms again&s;t them, which we were very de&s;irous to avoid. Tupia was therefore ordered to acquaint them that we had weapons which, like thunder, would de&s;troy them in a mo|ment; that we would immediately convince them of their power by directing their effect &s;o that they &s;hould not be hurt; but that if they per&s;i&s;ted in any ho&s;tile attempt, we &s;hould be obliged to u&s;e them for our defence: a four-pounder, loaded with grape-&s;hot, was then di&s;charged wide of them, which produced the de&s;ired effect; the report, the fla&s;h, and above all the &s;hot, which &s;pread very fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the water, &s;o in|timidated them, that they began to paddle away with all their might: Tupia, however, calling after them, and a&s;&s;uring them that if they would come unarmed, they &s;hould be kindly received; the people in one of the boats put their arms on board of another, and came under the &s;hip's &s;tern; we made them &s;everal pre&s;ents, and &s;hould certainly have prevailed upon them to come on board, if the other canoes had not come up, and again threatened us, by &s;houting and brandi&s;hing their weapons: at this the people who had come to the &s;hip un|armed, expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;oon after they all went away.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we &s;tood over to the &s;outh point of the bay, but not reaching it before it was dark, we &s;tood off and on all night. At eight the next morning, being a-brea&s;t of the point, &s;everal fi&s;hing boats came off to us, and &s;old us &s;ome &s;tinking fi&s;h: it was the be&s;t they had, and we were willing to trade with them upon any terms: the&s;e people behaved very well, and we &s;hould have parted good friends if it had not been for a large canoe, with two and twenty armed men on board,
<PB N="192" REF="013324_0219_0F8FFBA2D4B22438">
which came boldly up along &s;ide of the &s;hip. We &s;oon &s;aw that this boat had nothing for traffick, yet we gave them two or three pieces of cloth, an article which they &s;eemed very fond of, I ob&s;erved that one man had a black &s;kin thrown over him, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of a bear, and being de&s;irous to know what animal was its fir&s;t owner, I offered him for it a piece of red baize, and he &s;eemed greatly plea&s;ed with the bargain, immediately pulling off the &s;kin, and holding it up in the boat; he would not, however, part with it till he had the cloth in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and as there could be no transfer of property, if with equal caution I had in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ame condition, I ordered the cloth to be handed down to him, upon which, with amazing coolne&s;s, in&s;tead of &s;ending up the &s;kin, he began to pack up both that and the baize, which he had received as the purcha&s;e of it, in a ba&s;ket, without paying the lea&s;t regard to my demand or remon&s;trances, and &s;oon after, with the fi&s;hing boats, put off from the &s;hip; when they were at &s;ome di&s;tance, they drew together, and after a &s;hort con&s;ul|tation returned; the fi&s;hermen offered more fi&s;h, which though good for nothing, was purcha&s;ed, and trade was again renewed. Among others who were placed over the &s;hip's &s;ide to hand up what we bought, was little Tayeto, Tupia's boy; and one of the Indians, watching his opportunity, &s;uddenly &s;eized him, and dragged him down into the canoe; two of them held him down in the forepart of it, and the others, with great activity, paddled her off, the re&s;t of the canoes following as fa&s;t as they could: upon this the marines, who were under arms upon deck, were ordered to fire. The &s;hot was directed to that part of the canoe which was farthe&s;t from the boy, and rather wide of her, being willing rather to mi&s;s the rowers than to hurt him: it happened, however, that one man dropped, upon which the others quitted their hold of the boy, who in&s;tantly leaped into the water, and &s;wam towards the &s;hip; the large canoe immediately pulled round and followed him, but &s;ome mu&s;quets, and a great gun being fired at her, &s;he de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit. The &s;hip being brought to, a boat was lowered, and the poor boy taken up unhurt, though &s;o terrified that for a time he &s;eemed to be deprived of his &s;en&s;es. Some of the gentlemen who traced the canoes to &s;hore with their gla&s;&s;es, &s;aid, that they &s;aw three men carried up the beach, who ap|peared to be either dead or wholly di&s;abled by their wounds.</P>
<P>To the cape off which this unhappy tran&s;action happened, I gave the name of Cape Kidnappers. It lies in latitude 39&deg; 43&prime;, and longitude 182, 24 W. and is rendered remarkable by two white rocks like hay &s;tacks, and the high white cliffs on each &s;ide. It lies S. W, by W. di&s;tant thirteen leagues from the i&s;le of Portland; and between them is the bay of which it is the &s;outh point, and which, in honour of Sir Edward
<PB N="193" REF="013324_0220_0F8FFBA3F7D00278">
Hawke, then fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, I called Hawkes-Bay. We found in it from twenty-four to &s;even fathom, and good anchorage. From Cape Kidnappers the land trends S. S. W. and in this direction we made our run along the &s;hore, keeping at about a league di&s;tance, with a &s;teady breeze and clear weather.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Tayeto recovered from his fright, he brought a fi&s;h to Tupia, and told him, that he intended it as an offering to his Eatua, or God, in gratitude for his e&s;cape; Tupia commended his piety, and ordered him to throw the fi&s;h into the &s;ea, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>About two o'clock in the afternoon, we pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall but high white i&s;land, lying clo&s;e to the &s;hore, upon which we &s;aw many hou&s;es, boats, and people. The people we con|cluded to be fi&s;hers, becau&s;e the i&s;land was totally barren; we &s;aw &s;everal people al&s;o on &s;hore, in a &s;mall bay upon the main, within the i&s;land. At 11 we brought to till day-light, and then made &s;ail to the &s;outhward, along the &s;hore. About &s;even o'clock we pa&s;t a high point of land, which lies S. S. W. twelve leagues from Cape Kidnappers: from this point the land trends three-fourths of a point more to the we&s;tward; at ten we &s;aw more land open to the &s;outhward, and at noon, the &s;outhermo&s;t land that was in &s;ight, bore S. 39 W. di&s;tant eight or ten leagues, and a high bluff head, with yellowi&s;h cliffs, bore W. di&s;tant about two miles: the depth of water was thirty-two fathom.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we had a fre&s;h breeze at we&s;t, and during the night variable light airs and calms: in the morning a gentle breeze &s;prung up between the N. W. and N. E. and hav|ing till now &s;tood to the &s;outhward, without &s;eeing any proba|bility of meeting with a harbour, and the country manife&s;tly altering for the wor&s;e, I thought that &s;tanding farther in that direction would be attended with no advantage, but on the contrary would be a lo&s;s of time that might be employed with a better pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in examining the coa&s;t to the north|ward; about one, therefore, in the afternoon, I tacked and &s;tood north, with a fre&s;h breeze at we&s;t. The high bluff head, with yellowi&s;h cliffs, which we were a-brea&s;t of at noon, I called CAPE TURNAGAIN, becau&s;e here we turned back. It lies in latitude 40&deg; 34&prime; S. longitude, 182&deg; 55&prime; W. di&s;tant eighteen leagues S. S. W. and S. S. W. &frac12; W. from Cape Kidnappers. The land between them is of a very unequal height; in &s;ome places it is lofty next the &s;ea with white cliffs, in others low, with &s;andy beaches: the face of the country is not &s;o well clothed with wood as it is about Hawke's bay, but looks more like our high downs in England: it is, however, to all appearance, well inhabited, for as we &s;tood along the &s;hore, we &s;aw &s;everal villages, not only in the vallies, but on
<PB N="194" REF="013324_0221_0F8FFBA457745178">
the tops and &s;ides of the hills, and &s;moke in many other places. The ridge of mountains which has been mentioned before, extends to the &s;outhward farther than we could &s;ee, and was then every where chequered with &s;now. At night we &s;aw two fires inland, &s;o very large, that we concluded they mu&s;t have been made to clear the land for tillage; but how|ever that be, they are a demon&s;tration that the part of the country, where they appeared, is inhabited.</P>
<P>On the 18th, at four o'clock in the morning, Cape Kid|nappers bore N. 32 W. di&s;tant two leagues: in this &s;ituation we had &s;ixty-two fathom, and when the Cape bore W. by N. di&s;tant three or four leagues, we had forty-five fathom: in the mid-way between the i&s;le of Portland and the Cape we had &s;ixty-five fathom. In the evening, being a-brea&s;t of the pen|in&s;ula within Portland i&s;land, called TERAKAKO, a canoe came off from that &s;hore, and with much difficulty overtook the &s;hip; there were on board five people, two of whom ap|peared to be Chiefs, and the other three &s;ervants: the Chiefs with very little invitation came on board, and ordered the re&s;t to remain in their canoe. We treated them with great kind|ne&s;s, and they were not backward in expre&s;&s;ing their &s;atisfac|tion; they went down-into the cabin, and after a &s;hort time told us that they had determined not to go on &s;hore till the next morning. As the &s;leeping on board was an honour which we neither expected nor de&s;ired, I remon&s;trated &s;trongly again&s;t it, and told them, that on their account it would not be proper, as the &s;hip would probably be at a great di&s;tance from where &s;he was then, the next morning: they per&s;i&s;ted, however, in their re&s;olution, and as I found it impo&s;&s;ible to get rid of them without turning them by force out of the &s;hip, I complied: as a proper precaution, however, I propo&s;ed to take their &s;ervants al&s;o on board, and hoi&s;t their canoe into the &s;hip; they made no objection, and this was accordingly done. The countenance of one of the&s;e Chiefs was the mo&s;t open and the mo&s;t ingenuous of all I have ever &s;een, and I very &s;oon gave up every &s;u&s;picion of his having any &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign: they both examined every thing they &s;aw with great curio&s;ity and attention, and received very thankfully &s;uch little pre&s;ents as we made them, neither of them however, could be per&s;uaded either to eat or drink, but their &s;ervants devoured every thing they could get with great voracity. We found that the&s;e men had heard of our kindne&s;s and liberality to the natives who had been on board before, yet we thought the confidence they placed in us, an extraordinary in&s;tance of their fortitude. At night I brought to till day-light, and then made &s;ail; at &s;even in the morning, I brought to again under Cape Table, and &s;ent away our gue&s;ts with their canoe, who expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;o far from home,
<PB N="195" REF="013324_0222_0F8FFBA6742BDD90">
but landed a-brea&s;t of the &s;hip. At this time I &s;aw other ca|noes putting off from the &s;hore, but I &s;tood away to the north|ward without waiting for their coming up.</P>
<P>About three, I pa&s;&s;ed a remarkable head land, which I called GABLE-END-FORELAND, from the very great likene&s;s of the white cliff at the point, to the gable-end of a hou&s;e: it is not more remarkable for its figure, than for a rock which ri&s;es like a &s;pire at a little di&s;tance. It lies from Cape Table N. 24 E. di&s;tant about twelve leagues. The &s;hore between them forms a bay, within which lies Poverty Bay, at the di&s;|tance of four leagues from the head land, and eight from the Cape. At this place three canoes came off to us, and one man came on board; we gave him &s;ome trifles, and he &s;oon returned to his boat, which, with all the re&s;t, dropped a|&s;tern.</P>
<P>In the morning I made &s;ail in &s;hore, in order to look into two bays, which appeared about two leagues to the northward of the Foreland; the &s;outhermo&s;t I could not fetch, but I an|chored in the other about eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>Into this bay we were invited by the people on board many canoes, who pointed to a place where they &s;aid there was plenty of fre&s;h water: I did not find &s;o good a &s;helter from the &s;ea as I expected, but the natives who came about us, ap|pearing to be of a friendly di&s;po&s;ition, I was determined to try whether I could not get &s;ome knowlege of the country here be|fore I proceeded farther to the northward.</P>
<P>In one of the canoes that came about us as &s;oon as we an|chored, we &s;aw two men, who by their habits appeared to be Chiefs: one of them was dre&s;&s;ed in a jacket, which was or|namented, after their manner, with dog's &s;kin; the jacket of the other was almo&s;t covered with &s;mall tufts of red feathers. The&s;e men I invited on board, and they entered the &s;hip with very little he&s;itation: I gave each of them about four yards of linen, and a &s;pike nail; with the linen they were much plea&s;|ed, but &s;eemed to &s;et no value upon the nail. We perceived that they knew what had happened in Poverty bay, and we had therefore no rea&s;on to doubt but that they would behave peace|ably; however, for further &s;ecurity, Tupia was ordered to tell them for what purpo&s;e we came thither, and to a&s;&s;ure them that we would offer them no injury, if they offered none to us. In the mean time tho&s;e who remained in the canoes traded with our people very fairly for what they happened to have with them: the Chiefs, who were old men, &s;taid with us till we had dined, and about two o'clock I put off with the boats, manned and armed, in order to go on &s;hore in &s;earch of water, and the two chiefs went into the boat with me. The after|noon was tempe&s;tuous, with much rain, and the &s;urf every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;o high, that although we rowed almo&s;t round the
<PB N="196" REF="013324_0223_0F8FFBA68952DF10">
bay, we found no place where we could land; I determined therefore to return to the &s;hip, which being intimated to the Chiefs, they called to the people on &s;hore, and ordered a ca|noe to be &s;ent off for them&s;elves; this was accordingly done, and they left us, promi&s;ing to come on board again in the morning, and bring us &s;ome fi&s;h and &s;weet potatoes.</P>
<P>In the evening, the weather having become fair and mo|derate, the boats were again ordered out, and I landed, ac|companied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We were received with great expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip by the natives, who be|haved with a &s;crupulous attention not to give offence. In particular they took care not to appear in great bodies: one family, or the inhabitants of two or three hou&s;es only, were generally placed together, to the number of fifteen or twenty, con&s;i&s;ting of men, women and children. The&s;e little com|panies &s;at upon the ground, not advancing towards us, but inviting us to them, by a kind of beckon, moving one hand towards the brea&s;t. We made them &s;everal little pre&s;ents; and in our walk round the bay found two &s;mall &s;treams of fre&s;h water. This convenience, and the friendly behaviour of the people, determined me to &s;tay at lea&s;t a day, that I might fill &s;ome of my empty ca&s;ks, and give Mr. Banks an opportunity of examining the natural produce of the country.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 21&s;t, I &s;ent Lieutenant Gore on &s;hore, to &s;uperintend the watering, with a &s;trong party of men; and they were &s;oon followed by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with Tupia, Tayeto, and four others.</P>
<P>The natives &s;at by our people, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed to ob|&s;erve them; but did not intermix with them: they traded however, chiefly for cloth, and after a &s;hort time applied to their ordinary occupations, as if no &s;tranger had been among them. In the forenoon, &s;everal of their boats went out a fi&s;h|ing, and at dinner time every one repaired to his re&s;pective dwelling; from which, after a certain time, he returned. The&s;e fair appearances encouraged Mr. Banks and Dr. Solan|der to range the bay with very little precaution, where they found many plants, and &s;hot &s;ome birds of exqui&s;ite beauty. In their walk, they vi&s;ited &s;everal hou&s;es of the natives, and &s;aw &s;omething of their manner of life; for they &s;howed, with|out any re&s;erve, every thing which the Gentlemen de&s;ired to &s;ee. They were &s;ometimes found at their meals, which the approach of the &s;trangers never interrupted. Their food at this &s;ea&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of fi&s;h, with which, in&s;tead of bread, they eat the root of a kind of fern, very like that which grows upon our commons in England. The&s;e roots they &s;corch over the fire, and then beat with a &s;tick, till the bark and dry out&s;ide fall off; what remains is a &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ome|what clammy and &s;weet, not unplea&s;ing to the ta&s;te, but mixed
<PB N="197" REF="013324_0224_0F8FFBA770C2A698">
with three or four times its quantity of &s;trings and fibres, which are very di&s;agreeable; the&s;e were &s;wallowed by &s;ome, but &s;pit out by the far greater number, who had ba&s;kets under them to receive the rejected part of what had been chewed, which had an appearance very like that of tobacco in the &s;ame &s;tate. In other &s;ea&s;ons they have certainly plenty of excellent vegetables; but no tame animals were &s;een among them ex|cept dogs, which were very &s;mall and ugly. Mr. Banks &s;aw &s;ome of their plantations, where the ground was as well brok|en down and tilled as even in the gardens of the mo&s;t curious people among us: in the&s;e &s;pots were &s;weet potatoes, coccos or eddas, which are well known and much e&s;teemed both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and &s;ome gourds: the &s;weet po|tatoes were planted in &s;mall hills, &s;ome ranged in rows, and others in quincu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">x, all laid by a line with the greate&s;t regu|larity: the coccos were planted upon flat land, but none of them yet appeared above ground; and the gourds were &s;et in &s;mall hollows, or di&s;hes, much as in England. The&s;e plan|tations were of different extent, from one or two acres to ten: taken together, there appeared to be from one hundred and fifty to two hundred acres in cultivation in the whole bay, though we never &s;aw an hundred people. Each di&s;trict was fenced in, generally with reeds, which were placed &s;o clo&s;e together, that there was &s;carcely room for a mou&s;e to creep between.</P>
<P>The women were plain, and made them&s;elves more &s;o by painting their faces with red ocre and oil, which being ge|nerally fre&s;h and wet upon their cheeks and foreheads, was ea&s;ily transferred to the no&s;es of tho&s;e who thought fit to &s;alute them; and that they were not wholly aver&s;e to &s;uch familiarity, the no&s;es of &s;everal of our people &s;trongly te&s;ti|fied; they were, however, as great coquets as any of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable ladies in Europe, and the young ones as &s;kitti&s;h as an unbroken filly: each of them wore a petticoat, under which there was a girdle, made of the blades of gra&s;s highly perfumed, and to the girdle was fa&s;tened a &s;mall bunch of the leaves of &s;ome fragant plant, which &s;erved their mode&s;ty as its innermo&s;t ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l. The faces of the men were not &s;o generally painted, yet we &s;aw one who&s;e whole body, and even his gar|ments were rubbed over with dry ocre, of which he kept a piece con&s;tantly in his hand, and was every minute renewing the decoration in one part or another, where he &s;uppo&s;ed it was become deficient. In per&s;onal, delicacy they were not equal to our friends at Otaheite, for the coldne&s;s of the cli|mate did not invite them &s;o often to bathe; but we &s;aw among them one in&s;tance of cleanline&s;s in which they ex|ceeded them, and of which, perhaps, there is no example in any other Indian nation. Every hou&s;e, or every little clu&s;ter

of three or four hou&s;es, was furni&s;hed with a privy, &s;o that the ground was every where clean. The offals of their food, and other litter, were al&s;o piled up in regular dunghills, which probably they made u&s;e of at a proper time for ma|nure.</P>
<P>In this decent article of civil oeconomy they were before-hand with one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable nations of Europe, for I am credibly informed, that till the year 1760, there was no &s;uch thing as a privy in Madrid, the metropolis of Spain, though it is plentifully &s;upplied with water. Before that time it was the univer&s;al practice to throw the ordure out of the windows, during the night, into the &s;treet, where num|bers of men were employed to remove it, with &s;hovels, from the upper parts of the city to the lower, where it lay till it was dry, and was then carried away in carts, and depo&s;ited without the gates. His pre&s;ent Catholic Maje&s;ty, having determined to free his capital from &s;o gro&s;s a nui&s;ance, ordered, by pro|clamation, that the proprietor of every hou&s;e &s;hould build a privy, and that &s;inks, drains, and common &s;ewers &s;hould be made at the public expence. The Spaniards, though long accu&s;tomed to an arbitrary government, re&s;ented this procla|mation with great &s;pirit, as an infringement of the common rights of mankind, and made a vigorous &s;truggle again&s;t its being carried into execution. Every cla&s;s devi&s;ed &s;ome ob|jection again&s;t it, but the phy&s;icians bid the faire&s;t to intere&s;t the king in the pre&s;ervation of the ancient privileges of his people; for they remon&s;trated that if the filth was not, as u&s;ual, thrown into the &s;treets, a fatal &s;ickne&s;s would probably en&s;ue, becau&s;e the putre&s;cent particles of the air, which &s;uch filth attracted, would then be imbibed by the human body. But this expedient, with every other that could be thought of, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the popular di&s;content then ran &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">gh, that it was very near producing an in&s;urrection; his Ma|je&s;ty, however, at length prevailed, and Madrid is now as clear as mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable cities in Europe. But many of the citizens, probably upon the principles advanced by their phy|&s;icians, that heaps of filth prevent deleterious particles of air from fixing upon neighbouring &s;ub&s;tances, have to keep their food whole&s;ome, con&s;tructed their privies by the kitchen fire.</P>
<P>In the evening all our boats being employed in carrying the water on board, and Mr. Bands and his company finding it probable that they &s;hould be left on &s;hore after it was dark, by which much time would be lo&s;t, which they were impatient to employ in putting the plants they had gathered in order, they applied to the Indians for a pa&s;&s;age in one of their ca|noes: they immediately con&s;ented, and a canoes was launch|ed for their u&s;e. They went all on board, being eight in number, but not being u&s;ed to a ve&s;&s;el that required &s;o even
<PB N="199" REF="013324_0226_0F8FFBA8D66B26A8">
a balance, they unfortunately over&s;et her in the &s;urf: no life however was lo&s;t, but it was thought advi&s;eable that half of them &s;hould wait for another turn. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solan|der, Tupia, and Tayeto embarked again, and without any farther accident arrived &s;afely at the &s;hip, well plea&s;ed with the good-nature of their Indian friends, who cheerfully under|took to carry them a &s;econd time, after having experienced how unfit a freight they were for &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>While the&s;e gentlemen were on &s;hore, &s;everal of the natives went off to the &s;hip, and trafficked, by exchanging their cloth for that of Otaheite: of this barter they were for &s;ome time very fond, preferring the Indian cloth to that of Europe; but before night it decrea&s;ed in its value five hundred per cent. Many of the&s;e Indians I took on board, and &s;hewed them the &s;hip and her apparatus, at which they expre&s;&s;ed equal &s;atis|faction and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>As I found it exceedingly difficult to get water on board on account of the &s;urf, I determined to &s;tay no longer at this place; on the next morning, therefore, about five o'clock, I weighed anchor and put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>This bay, which is called by the natives TEGADOO, lies in the latitude of 38&deg; 10&prime; S., but as it has nothing to recommend it, a de&s;cription of it is unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>From this bay I intended to &s;tand on to the northward, but the wind being right again&s;t me, I could make no way. While I was beating about to windward, &s;ome of the natives came on board, and told me, that in a bay which lay a little to the &s;outhward, being the &s;ame that I could not fetch the day I put into Tegadoo, there was excellent water, where the boats might land without a &s;urf. I thought it better, there|fore, to put into this bay, where I might complete my water, and form farther connexions with the Indians, than to keep the &s;ea. With this view I bore up for it, and &s;ent in two boats, manned and armed, to examine the watering place, who confirming the report of the Indians at their return, I came to an anchor about one o'clock, in eleven fathom water, with a fine &s;andy bottom, the north point of the bay N. by E. and the &s;outh point S. E. The watering-place, which was in a &s;mall cove, a little within the &s;outh point of the bay, bore S. by E. di&s;tant about a mile. Many canoes came imme|diately off from the &s;hore, and all traded very hone&s;tly for Otaheite cloth and gla&s;s bottles, of which they were immo|derately fond.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the 23d, as &s;oon as the &s;hip was moored, I went on &s;hore to examine the watering place, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander: the boat landed in the cove, without the lea&s;t &s;urf; the water was excellent, and conve|niently &s;ituated; there was plenty of wood clo&s;e to high-water

mark, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the people was in every re&s;pect &s;uch as we could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Having, with Mr. Green taken &s;everal ob&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, the mean re&s;ult of them gave 180&deg;, 47&prime; W. longitude; but as all the ob&s;ervations made before exceeded the&s;e, I have laid down the coa&s;t from the mean of the whole. At noon I took the &s;un's meridian altitude with an a&s;tronomi|cal quadrant, which was &s;et up at the watering place, and found the latitude to be 388 22&prime; 24&Prime;.</P>
<P>On the 24th, early in the morning, I &s;ent Lieutenant Gore on &s;hore, to &s;uperintend the cutting of wood and filling of water, with a &s;ufficient number of men for both purpo&s;es, and all the marines as a guard. After breakfa&s;t I went on &s;hore my&s;elf, and continued there the whole day.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander al&s;o went on &s;hore to gather plants, and in their walks &s;aw &s;everal things worthy of notice. They met with many hou&s;es in the vallies that &s;eemed to be wholly de&s;erted, the people living on the ridges of the hills, in a kind of &s;heds very &s;lightly built. As they were advan|cing in one of the&s;e vallies, the hills on each &s;ide of which were very &s;teep, they were &s;uddenly &s;truck with the &s;ight of a very extraordinary natural curio&s;ity. It was a rock, perfo|rated through its whole &s;ub&s;tance, &s;o as to form a rude but &s;tu|pendous arch or cavern, opening directly to the &s;ea; this aper|ture was &s;eventy-five feet long, twenty-&s;even broad, and five and forty high, commanding a view of the bay and the hills on the other &s;ide, which were &s;een through it, and, opening at once upon the view, produced an effect far &s;uperior to any of the contrivances of art.</P>
<P>As they were returning to the watering-place in the even|ing, they met an old man, who detained them &s;ome time by &s;howing them the military exerci&s;es of the country with the lance and Patoo-Patoo, which are all the weapons in u&s;e. The lance is from ten to fourteen feet long, made of a very hard wood, and &s;harp at both ends: the Patoo-Patoo has been de&s;cribed already, it is about a foot long, made of Tale or bone, with &s;harp edges, and u&s;ed as a battle-axe. A po&s;t or &s;take was &s;et up as his enemy, to which he advanced with a mo&s;t furious a&s;pect, brandi&s;hing his lance, which he gra&s;ped with great firmne&s;s; when it was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been pierced by his lance, he ran at it with his Patoo-Patoo, and falling upon the upper end of it, which was to repre&s;ent his adver&s;a|ry's head, he laid on with great vehemence, &s;triking many blows, any one of which would probably have &s;plit the &s;kull of an ox. From our champions falling upon his mock enemy with the Patoo-Patoo, after he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been pierced with the lance, our Gentlemen inferred, that in the battles of this country there is no quarter.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="013324_0228_0F8FFBAA500768A8">
This afternoon, we &s;et up the armourer's forge, to repair the braces of the tiller which had been broken, and went on getting our wood and water, without &s;uffering the lea&s;t mo|le&s;tation from the natives; who came down with different &s;orts of fi&s;h, which we purcha&s;ed with cloth, beads, and gla&s;s bottles, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>On the 25th, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went again on &s;hore; and while they were &s;earching for plants, Tupia &s;taid with the waterers: among other Indians who came down to them, was a prie&s;t, with whom Tupia entered into a very learned conver&s;ation. In their notions of religion they &s;eemed to agree very well, which is not often the ca&s;e between learn|ed divines on our &s;ide of the ocean: Tupia, however, &s;eemed to have the mo&s;t knowledge, and he was li&s;tened to with great deference and attention by the other. In the cour&s;e of this conver&s;ation, after the important points of divinity had been &s;ettled, Tupia enquired if it was their practice to eat men, to which they an&s;wered in the affirmative; but &s;aid that they eat only their enemies, who were &s;lain in battle.</P>
<P>On the 26th, it rained all day, &s;o that none of us could go a&s;hore; and very few of the Indians came either to the wa|tering-place or the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 27th, I went with Dr. Solander to examine the bottom of the bay; but though we went a&s;hore at two places, we met with little worth notice. The people behaved very civilly, &s;hewing us every thing that we expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee. Among other trifling curio&s;ities which Dr. Solander purcha&s;ed of them, was a boy's top, &s;haped exactly like tho&s;e which children play with in England; and they made &s;igns, that to make it &s;pin it was to be whipped. Mr. Banks in the mean time went a&s;hore at the watering-place, and climbed a hill which &s;tood at a little di&s;tance, to &s;ee a fence of poles, which we had ob&s;erved from the &s;hip, and which had been much the &s;ubject of &s;peculation. The hill was extremely &s;leep, and rendered almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible by wood; yet he reach|ed the place, near which he found many hou&s;es that for &s;ome rea&s;on had been de&s;erted by their inhabitants. The poles ap|peared to be about &s;ixteen feet high; they were placed in two rows, with a &s;pace of about &s;ix feet between them, and the poles in each row were about ten feet di&s;tant from each other. The lane between them was covered by &s;ticks, that were &s;et up &s;loping towards each other, from the top of the poles on each &s;ide, like the roof of a hou&s;e. This rail-work, with a ditch that was parallel to it, was carried about an hundred yards down the hill in a kind of curve; but for what purpo&s;e we could not gue&s;s.</P>
<P>The Indians, at the watering-place, at our reque&s;t, enter|tained us with their war-&s;ong, in which the women joined,
<PB N="202" REF="013324_0229_0F8FFBAB0DD1D780">
with the mo&s;t horrid di&s;tortions of countenance, rolling their eyes, thru&s;ting out their tongues, and often heaving loud and deep &s;ighs; though all was done in very good time.</P>
<P>On the 28th we went a&s;hore upon an i&s;land that lies to the left hand of the entrance of the bay, where we &s;aw the large&s;t canoe that we had yet met with: &s;he was &s;ixty-eight feet and an half long, five broad, and three feet &s;ix high; &s;he had a &s;harp bottom, con&s;i&s;ting of three trunks of trees hollowed, of which that in the middle was the longe&s;t: the &s;ide planks were &s;ixty-two feet long in one piece, and were not de&s;picably carved in bas relief; the head al&s;o was adorned with carving &s;till more richly. Upon this i&s;land there was a larger hou&s;e than any we had yet &s;een; but it &s;eemed unfini&s;hed and was full of chips. The wood work was &s;quared &s;o even and &s;mooth, that we made no doubt of their having among them very &s;harp tools. The &s;ides of the po&s;ts were carved in a ma&s;|terly &s;tile, though after their whim&s;ical ta&s;te, which &s;eems to prefer &s;piral lines and di&s;torted faces: as the&s;e carved po&s;ts appeared to have been brought from &s;ome other place, &s;uch work is probably of great value among them.</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the morning of the 29, having got on board our wood and water, and a large &s;upply of excellent celery, with which the country abounds, and which proved a powerful anti&s;corbutic, I unmoored and put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>This bay is called by the natives TOLAGA; it is moderately large, and has from &s;even to thirteen fathom, with a clean &s;andy bottom, and good anchorage; and is &s;heltered from all winds except the north ea&s;t. It lies in latitude 38&deg; 22&prime; S. and four leagues and an half to the north of Gable-end Foreland. on the &s;outh point lies a &s;mall but high i&s;land, &s;o near the main as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from it. Clo&s;e to the north end of the i&s;land, at the entrance into the bay, are two high rocks; one is round like a corn-&s;tack, but the other is long, and perforated in &s;everal places &s;o that the openings appear like the arches of a bridge. Within the&s;e rocks is the cove where we cut wood, and filled our water-ca&s;ks. Off the north point of the bay is a pretty high rocky i&s;land; and about a mile without it, are &s;ome rocks and breakers. The variation of the compa&s;s here is 14&deg; 31&prime; E. and the tide flows at the full and change of the moon, about &s;ix o'clock, and ri&s;es and falls perpendicularly from five to &s;ix feet: whether the flood comes from the &s;outhward or the northward I have not been able to determine.</P>
<P>We got nothing here by traffic but a few fi&s;h, and &s;ome &s;weet potatoes, except a few trifles, which we con&s;idered merely as curio&s;ities. We &s;aw no four-footed animals, nor the appearance of any, either tame or wild, except dogs and rats, and the&s;e were very &s;carce: the people eat the dogs, like our

friends at Otaheite: and adorn their garments with the &s;kins, as we do ours with fur and ermine. I climbed many of the hills, hoping to get a view of the country, but I could &s;ee no|thing from the top except higher hills, in a boundle&s;s &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion. The ridges of the&s;e hills produce little be&s;ides fern; but the &s;ides are mo&s;t luxuriantly clothed with wood, and verdure of various kinds, with little plantations intermixed. In the woods we found trees of above twenty different &s;orts, and car|ried &s;pecimens of each on board; but there was nobody among us to whom they were not altogether unknown. The tree which we cut for firing was &s;omewhat like our maple, &amp; yield|ed a whiti&s;h gum. We found another &s;ort of it of a deep yellow, which we thought might be u&s;eful in dying. We found al&s;o one cabbage tree, which we cut down for the cabbages. The country abounds with plants, and the woods with birds, in an endle&s;s variety, exqui&s;itely beautiful, and of which none of us had the lea&s;t knowledge. The &s;oil both of the hills and valleys is light and &s;andy, and very fit for the production of all kinds of roots; though we &s;aw none except &s;weet potatoes and yams.</P>

<P>ON Monday the 30th, about half an hour after one o'clock, having made &s;ail again to the northward for about ten hours, with a light breeze, I hauled round a &s;mall i&s;land, which lay ea&s;t one mile from the north ea&s;t point of the land: from this place I found the land trend away N. W. by W. and W. N. W. as far as I could &s;ee, this point being the ea&s;termo&s;t land on the whole coa&s;t. I gave it the name of EAST CAPE, and I called the i&s;land that lies off it EAST ISLAND; it is of a &s;mall circuit, high and round, and appears white and barren: the Cape is high, with white cliffs, and lies in latitude 37&deg; 42&prime;30&Prime; S. and longitude 181&deg; W. The land from Tolaga Bay to Ea&s;t Cape is of a moderate, but unequal height, form|ing &s;everal &s;mall bays, in which are &s;andy beaches: of the inland country we could not &s;ee much, the weather being cloudy and hazey. The &s;oundings were from twenty to thirty fathom, at the di&s;tance of about a league from the &s;hore. Af|ter we had rounded the Cape, we &s;aw in our run along the &s;hore a great number of villages, and much cultivated land; the country in general appeared more fertile than before, and

was low near the &s;ea, but hilly within. At &s;ix in the evening, being four leagues to the we&s;tward of Ea&s;t Cape, we pa&s;&s;ed a bay which was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Lieutenant Hicks, and which therefore I called HICKS's BAY. At eight in the evening, being eight leagues to the we&s;tward of the Cape, and three or four miles from the &s;hore, I &s;hortened &s;ail and brought to for the night, having at this time a fre&s;h gale at S. S. E. and &s;qually; but it &s;oon became moderate, and at two in the morning, we made &s;ail again to the S. W. as the land now trended; and at eight o'clock in the morning, &s;aw land which made like an i&s;land, bearing we&s;t, the &s;outh we&s;termo&s;t part of the main bearing &s;outh we&s;t; and about nine no le&s;s than five canoes came off, in which were more than forty men, all armed with their country pikes and battle-axes, &s;houting and threatening an attack: this gave us great unea&s;ine&s;s, and was indeed what we did not expect; for we hoped, that the report both of our power and clemency had &s;pread to a greater extent. When one of the&s;e canoes had almo&s;t reached the &s;hip, another, of an immen&s;e &s;ize, the large&s;t we had yet &s;een, crowded with people who were al&s;o armed, put off from the &s;hore, and came up at a great rate; as it approached it received &s;ignals from the canoe that was neare&s;t to the &s;hip, and we could &s;ee that it had &s;ixteen paddles on a &s;ide, be&s;ide people that &s;at, and others that &s;tood in a row from &s;tem to &s;tern, being in all about 60 men: as they made directly to the &s;hip, we were de&s;irous of preventing an attack, by &s;howing what we could do; and therefore fired a gun, loaded with grape-&s;hot, ahead of them; this made them &s;top, but not retreat; a round &s;hot was then fired over them, and upon &s;eing it fall, they &s;eized their padd|les, and made towards the &s;hore with &s;uch precipitation, that they &s;carcely &s;eemed to allow them&s;elves time to breathe. In the evening 3 or 4 more canoes came off unarmed; but they would not venture within a mu&s;quet &s;hot of the ve&s;&s;el. The cape, off which we had been threatened with ho&s;tilities, I called, from the ha&s;ty retreat of the enemy, CAPE RUNAWAY. It lies in latitude 37&deg; 32&prime;; longitude 181&deg; 48&prime;. In this day's run, we found rhat the land, which made like an i&s;land in the morning, bearing we&s;t, was &s;o; and we gave it the name of WHITE ISLAND.</P>
<P>At day-break, on the fir&s;t of November, we counted no le&s;s than five and forty canoes that were coming from the &s;hore towards the &s;hip: &s;even of them came up with us, and after &s;ome conver&s;ation with Tupia, &s;old us &s;ome lob&s;ters and mu&s;cles, and two conger e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ls. The&s;e people traded pretty fairly: but when they were gone, &s;ome others came off from another place, who began al&s;o to trade fairly; but after &s;ome time they took what was handed down to them, without mak|ing any return; one of them who had done &s;o, upon being
<PB N="205" REF="013324_0232_0F8FFBAF16942AA8">
threatened, began to laugh, and with many marks of deri&s;ion &s;et us at defiance, at the &s;ame time putting off the canoe from the &s;hip: a mu&s;quet then was fired over his head, which brought him back in a more &s;erious mood, and trade went on with great regularity. At length, when the cabin and gun-room had got as much as they wanted, the men were allowed to come to the gang-way, and trade for them&s;elves. Unhap|pily the &s;ame care was not taken to prevent frauds as had been taken before, &s;o that the Indians, finding that they could cheat with impunity, grew in&s;olent again, and proceeded to take greater liberties. One of the canoes, having &s;old every thing on board, pulled forward, and the people that were in her &s;eeing &s;ome linen hang over the &s;hip's &s;ide to dry, one of them without any ceremony, untied it, and put it up in his bundle: he was immediately called to, and required to return it; in&s;tead of which he let his canoe drop a &s;tern, and laughed at us: a mu&s;quet was fired over his head, which did not put a &s;top to his mirth; another was then fired at him with &s;mall &s;hot, which &s;truck him upon the back; he &s;hrunk a little when the &s;hot hit him, but did not regard it more than one of our men would have done the &s;troke of a ratan: he continued with great compo&s;ure to pack up the linen that he had &s;tolen. All the canoes now dropped a &s;tern about an hundred yards, and all &s;et up their &s;ong of defiance, which they continued till the &s;hip was di&s;tant from them about four hundred yards. As they &s;eemed to have no de&s;ign to attack us, I was not willing to do them any hurt; yet I thought their going off in a brava|do might have a bad effect, when it &s;hould be reported a&s;hore. To &s;hew them therefore that they were &s;till in our power, tho' very much beyond the reach of any mi&s;&s;ile weapon with which they were acquainted, I gave the &s;hip a yaw, and fired a four pounder &s;o as to pa&s;s near them. The &s;hot happened to &s;trike the water, and ri&s;e &s;everal times at a great di&s;tance, beyond the canoes: this &s;truck them with terror, and they paddled away without once looking behind them.</P>
<P>About two in the afternoon, we &s;aw a pretty high i&s;land, bearing we&s;t from us; and at five, &s;aw more i&s;lands and rocks to the we&s;tward of that. We hauled our wind in order to go without them, but could not weather them before it was dark. I therefore bore up, and ran between them and the main. At &s;even, I was clo&s;e under the fir&s;t, from which a large double canoe, or rather two canoes la&s;hed together at the di&s;tance of about a foot, and covered with boards &s;o as to make a deck, put off, and made &s;ail for the &s;hip: this was the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el of the kind we had &s;een &s;ince we left the South Sea i&s;lands. When &s;he came near, the people on board en|tered very freely into conver&s;ation with Tupia, and we thought &s;hewed a friendly di&s;po&s;ition; but when it was ju&s;t dark, they
<PB N="206" REF="013324_0233_0F8FFBB00A140848">
ran their canoe clo&s;e to the &s;hip's &s;ide, and threw in a volley of &s;tones, after which they paddled a&s;hore.</P>
<P>We learnt from Tupia, that the people in the canoe called the i&s;land which we were under MOWTOHORA; it is but a &s;mall circuit, though high, and lies &s;ix miles from the main; on the &s;outh &s;ide is anchorage in fourteen fathom water. Upon the main land S. W. by W. of this i&s;land, and apparently at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> great di&s;tance from the &s;ea, is a high round mountain, which I called MOUNT EDGECOMBE: it &s;tands in the middle of a large plain, and is therefore the more con&s;picuous; lati|tude 37&deg; 59&prime;&punc; longitude 193&deg; 7&prime;.</P>
<P>In &s;tanding we&s;tward, we &s;uddenly &s;hoaled out water from &s;eventeen to ten fathom; and knowing that we were not far from the &s;mall i&s;lands and rocks which we had &s;een before dark, and which I intended to have pa&s;&s;ed before I brought to for the night, I thought it more prudent to tack, and &s;pend the night under Mowtohora, where I knew there was no danger. It was indeed happy for us that we did &s;o; for in the morning, after we had made &s;ail to the we&s;tward, we di&s;|covered, ahead of us, &s;everal rocks, &s;ome of which were level with the &s;urface of the water, and &s;ome below it: they lay N. N. E. from Mount Edgecombe, one league and an half di&s;tant from the i&s;land Mowtohora, and about nine miles from the main. We pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e rocks and the main, hav|ing from ten to &s;even fathom water.</P>
<P>This morning, many canoes and much people were &s;een along the &s;hore; &s;everal of the canoes followed us, but none of them could reach us, except one with a &s;ail, which proved to be the &s;ame which had pelted us the night before. The people on board again entered into conver&s;ation with Tupia; but we expected another volley of their ammunition, which was not indeed dangerous to any thing but the cabbin win|dows. They continued abrea&s;t of the &s;hip about an hour, and behaved very peaceably; but at la&s;t the &s;alute which we ex|pected was given; we returned it by firing a mu&s;quet over them, and they immediately dropped a-&s;tern and left us, per|haps rather &s;atisfied with having given a te&s;t of their courage by twice in&s;ulting a ve&s;&s;el &s;o much &s;uperior to their own, than intimidated by the &s;hot.</P>
<P>At half an hour after ten, we pa&s;&s;ed between a low flat i&s;land and the main: the di&s;tance from one to the other was about four miles, and the depth of water from ten to twelve fathom. The main land between this flat i&s;land and Mowto|hora is of a moderate height, but level, pretty clear of wood, and full of plantations and villages. The villages, which were larger than any we had yet &s;een, were built upon emi|nences near the &s;ea, and fortified on the land &s;ide by a bank and ditch, with a high paling within it, which was carried all
<PB N="207" REF="013324_0234_0F8FFBB052C5ADE8">
round: be&s;ides a bank, ditch, and palli&s;adoes, &s;ome of them appeared to have out-works. Tupia had a notion that the &s;mall inclo&s;ures of palli&s;adoes, and a ditch that we had &s;een before, were Morais or places of wor&s;hip; but we were of opinion that they were &s;orts, and concluded that the&s;e people had neighbouring enemies, and were always expo&s;ed to ho&s;tile attacks.</P>
<P>At two o'clock we pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall high i&s;land, lying four miles from a high round head upon the main. From this head the land trends N. W. as far as can be &s;een, and has a rugged and hilly appearance. As the weather was hazy, and the wind blew fre&s;h on the &s;hore, we hauled off for the weather|mo&s;t i&s;land in &s;ight which bore from us N. N. E. di&s;tant about &s;ix or &s;even leagues.</P>
<P>Under this i&s;land, which I called the MAYOR, we &s;pent the night. At &s;even in the morning it bore S. 47 E. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues, and a clu&s;ter of &s;mall i&s;lands and rocks bore N. 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> E. di&s;tant one league, to which I gave the name of the COURT OF ALDERMEN. They lie in the compa&s;s of about half a league every way, and five leagues from the main, between which and them lie other i&s;lands, mo&s;t of them bar|ren rocks, of which there is great variety: &s;ome of them are as &s;mall in compa&s;s as the monument of London, but ri&s;e to a much greater height, and &s;ome of them are inhabited. They lie in latitude 36&deg; 57&prime;, and at noon bore S. 60 E. di&s;tant three or four leagues; and a rock like a ca&s;tle, lying not far from the main, bore N. 40 W. at the di&s;tance of one league. The country that we pa&s;&s;ed the night before, appeared, to be well inhabited, many towns were in &s;ight, and &s;ome hund|reds of large canoes lay under them upon the beach; but the day, after having &s;ailed about fifteen leagues, it appeared to be barren and de&s;olate. As far as we had yet coa&s;ted this coun|try from Cape Turnagain, the people acknowledged one Chief, whom they called TERATU, and to who&s;e re&s;idence they pointed, in a direction that we thought to be very far i&s;|land, but afterwards found to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>About one o'clock three canoes came off to us from the main, with one and twenty men on board. The con&s;truction of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els appeared to be more &s;imple than that of any we had &s;een, they being nothing more than trunks of a &s;ingle tree hollowed by fire, without any convenience or ornament. The people on board were almo&s;t naked, and appeared to be of a browner complexion; yet naked and de&s;picable as they were, they &s;ung their &s;ong of defiance, and &s;eemed to de|nounce again&s;t us inevitable de&s;truction: they remained, how ever, &s;ome time out of &s;tones throw, and then venturing nearer, with le&s;s appearance of ho&s;tility, one of our men were to the &s;hip &s;ide, and was about to hand them a rope; the
<PB N="208" REF="013324_0235_0F8FFBB1116EA198">
courte&s;y, however, they thought fit to return by throwing a lance at him, which having mi&s;&s;ed him, they immediately threw another into the &s;hip: upon this a mu&s;quet was fired over them, which at once &s;ent them away.</P>
<P>About two we &s;aw a large opening, or inlet, for which we bore up; we had now forty-one fathom water, which gradu|ally decrea&s;ed to nine, at which time we were one mile and an half di&s;tant from a high towered rock, which lay near the &s;outh point of the inlet: this rock, and the northermo&s;t of the Court of Aldermen being in one, bearing S. 61 E.</P>
<P>About &s;even in the evening we anchored in &s;even fathom, a little within the &s;outh entrance of the bay: to this place we were accompanied by &s;everal canoes and people like tho&s;e we had &s;een la&s;t, and for &s;ome time they behaved very civilly. While they were hovering about us, a bird was &s;hot from the &s;hip, as it was &s;wimming upon the water: at this they &s;hewed le&s;s &s;urprize than we expected, and taking up the bird, they tied it to a fi&s;hing-line that was towing a-&s;tern; as an ac|knowledgment for this favour we gave them a piece of cloth: but notwith&s;tanding this effect of our fire-arms, and this inter|change of civilities, as &s;oon as it grew dark they &s;ung their war &s;ong, and attempted to tow away the buoy of the anchor. Two or three mu&s;kets were then fired over them, but this &s;eemed rather to make them angry than afraid, and they went away, threatening that to-morrow they would return with more force, and be the death of us all; at the &s;ame time &s;end|ing off a boat, which they told us was going to another part of the bay for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>There was &s;ome appearance of genero&s;ity, as well as cou|rage, in acquainting us with the time when they intended to make their attack, but they forfeited all credit which this procured them, by coming &s;ecretly upon us in the night, when they certainly hoped to find us a&s;leep: upon approach|ing the &s;hip they found them&s;elves mi&s;taken, and therefore retired without &s;peaking a word, &s;uppo&s;ing that they were too early; after &s;ome time they came a &s;econd time, and being again di&s;appointed, they retired as &s;ilently as before.</P>
<P>In the morning, at day-break, they prepared to effect by force what they had in vain attempted by &s;tealth and artifice: no le&s;s than twelve canoes came again&s;t us, with about an hundred and fifty men, all armed with pikes, lances, and &s;tones. As they could do nothing till they came very near the &s;hip, Tupia was ordered to expo&s;tulate with them, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to divert them from their purpo&s;e: during the con|ver&s;ation they appeared to be &s;ometimes friendly and &s;ome|times otherwi&s;e; at length, however, they began to trade, and we offered to purcha&s;e their weapons, which &s;ome of them con&s;ented to &s;ell: they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">old two very fairly, but having re|ceived
<PB N="209" REF="013324_0236_0F90F2BE6A255268">
what had been agreed upon for the purcha&s;e of a third, they refu&s;ed to &s;end it up, but offered it for a &s;econd price; a &s;econd was &s;ent down, but the weapon was &s;till detained, and a demand made of a third; this being refu&s;ed with &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ions of di&s;plea&s;ure and re&s;entment, the offender, with many ludicrous tokens of contempt and defiance, paddling his canoe off a few yards from the &s;hip. As I intended to conti|nue in this place five or &s;ix days, in order to make an ob&s;er|vation of the tran&s;it of Mercury, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to prevent future mi&s;chief, to &s;hew the&s;e people that we were not to be treated ill with impunity; &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot were therefore fired at the thief, and a mu&s;ket ball through the bottom of his boat: upon this it was paddled to about an hundred yards di&s;tance, and to our great &s;urprize, the people in the other canoes took not the lea&s;t notice of their wounded companion, though he bled very much, but returned to the &s;hip, and continued to trade with the mo&s;t perfect indifference and unconcern. They &s;old us many more of their weapons without making any other attempt to defraud us, for a con|&s;iderable time; at la&s;t, however, one of them thought fit to paddle away with two different pieces of cloth which had been given for the &s;ame weapon: when he had got about an hund|red yards di&s;tance, and thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of his prize, a mu&s;ket was fired after him, which fortunately &s;truck the boat ju&s;t at the water's edge, and made two holes in her &s;ide; this only incited them to ply their paddles with greater activity, and the re&s;t of the canoes al&s;o made off with the utmo&s;t expe|dition. As the la&s;t proof of our &s;uperiority therefore, we fired a round &s;hot over them, and not a boat &s;topped till they got on &s;hore.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock, I went with two boats to &s;ound the bay, and look out for a more convenient anchoring place, the ma&s;|ter being in one boat, and my&s;elf in the other. We pulled fir&s;t over to the north &s;hore, from which &s;ome canoes came out to meet us; as we advanced, however, they retired, inviting us to follow them: but, &s;eeing them all armed, I did not think it proper to comply, but went towards the head of the bay, where I ob&s;erved a village upon a very high point, for|tified in the manner that has been already de&s;cribed, and hav|ing fixed upon an anchoring-place, not far from where the &s;hip lay, I returned on board.</P>
<P>At three o'clock in the afternoon, I weighed, run in nearer to the &s;hore, and anchored in four fathom and an half water, with a &s;oft &s;andy bottom, the &s;outh point of the bay bearing E. di&s;tant one mile, and a river which the boats can enter at low water S. S. E. di&s;tant a mile and an half.</P>
<P>In the morning the natives came off again to the &s;hip, and we had the &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve that their behaviour was
<PB N="210" REF="013324_0237_0F8FFBB1DC864AB8">
very different from what it had been ye&s;terday: among them was an old man, whom we had before remarked for his pru|dence and hone&s;ty: his name was TOIAVA, and he &s;eemed to be a per&s;on of &s;uperior rank; in the tran&s;actions of ye&s;|terday morning he had behaved with great propriety and good &s;en&s;e, lying in a &s;mall canoe, always near the &s;hip, and treating tho&s;e on board, as if he neither intended a fraud, nor &s;u&s;pected an injury: with &s;ome per&s;ua&s;ion this man and an|other came on board, and ventured into the cabin, where I pre&s;ented each of them with a piece of Engli&s;h cloth, and &s;ome &s;pike nails. They told us that the Indians were now very much afraid of us; and on our part we promi&s;ed friend|&s;hip if they would behave peceably, de&s;iring only to pur|cha&s;e what they had to &s;ell upon their own terms.</P>
<P>After the natives had left us, I went with the pinnace and long-boat into the river, with a de&s;ign to haul the &s;eine, and &s;ent the Ma&s;ter in the yawl, to found the bay, and dredge for fi&s;h. The Indians who were on one &s;ide of the river, expre&s;|&s;ed their friend&s;hip by all the &s;igns they could devi&s;e, beck|oning us to land among them; but we cho&s;e to go a&s;hore on the other &s;ide, as the &s;ituation was more convenient for hauling the &s;eine, and &s;hooting birds, of which we &s;aw great numbers of various kinds: the Indians, with much per|&s;ua&s;ion, about noon, ventured over to us. With the &s;eine we had very little &s;ucce&s;s, catching only a few mullets, neither did we get any thing by the trawl, or the dredge, except a few &s;hells; but we &s;hot &s;everal birds, mo&s;t of them re&s;embling &s;ea-pies, except that they had black plumage, and red bills and feet. While we were ab&s;ent with our guns, the people who &s;taid by the boats &s;aw two of the Indians quarrel and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight: they began the battle with their lances, but &s;ome old men interpo&s;ed and took them away, leaving them to decide the difference, like Engli&s;hmen, with their fi&s;ts: they boxed with great vigour and ob&s;tinacy for &s;ome time, but by degrees all retired behind a little hill, &s;o that our people could not &s;ee the event of the combat.</P>
<P>In the morning the long-boat was &s;ent again to traul in the bay, and an officer, with the marines, and a party of men, to cut wood and haul the &s;eine. The Indians on &s;hore ap|peared very peaceable and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and we had rea&s;on to believe that their habitations were at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, for we &s;aw no hou&s;es, and found that they &s;lept under the bu&s;hes: the bay is probably a place to which they frequently re&s;ort in parties to gather &s;hell-fi&s;h, of which it affords incre|dible plenty, for wherever we went, whether upon the hills or in the vallies, the woods or the plains, we &s;aw va&s;t heaps of &s;hells, often many waggon loads together, &s;ome appearing to be very old, and others recent. We &s;aw no cultivation in this place, which had a de&s;olate and barren appearance; the
<PB N="211" REF="013324_0238_0F8FFBB2881B8FC0">
tops of the hills were green, but nothing grew there except a large kind of fern, the roots of which the natives had got to|gether in large quantities, in order to carry away with them. In the evening Mr. Banks walked up the river, which at the mouth looked fine and broad, but at the di&s;tance of about two miles was not deep enough to cover the foot; and the country inland was &s;till more barren than at the &s;ea-&s;ide. The &s;eine and dredge were not more &s;ucce&s;sful to-day than ye&s;ter|day, but the Indians in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ated for the di&s;appointment by bringing us &s;everal ba&s;kets of fi&s;h, &s;ome dry, and &s;ome fre&s;h dre&s;&s;ed; it was not indeed of the be&s;t, but I ordered it all to be bought for the encouragement of trade.</P>
<P>On the 7th, the weather was &s;o bad that none of us left the &s;hip, nor did any of the Indians come on board.</P>
<P>On the 8th, I &s;ent a party of men on &s;hore to wood and water; and in the mean time many canoes came off, in one of which was our friend Toiava; &s;oon after he was along&s;ide of the &s;hip, he &s;aw two canoes coming from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the bay, upon which he ha&s;ted back again to the &s;hore with all his canoes, telling us that he was afraid of the people who were coming: this was a farther proof that the people of this country were perpetually committing ho&s;tilities again&s;t each other. In a &s;hort time, however, he returned, having di&s;covered that the people who had alarmed him were not the &s;ame that he had &s;uppo&s;ed. The natives that came to the &s;hip this morning &s;old us, for a few pieces of cloth, as much fi&s;h of the mackrel kind as &s;erved the whole &s;hip's company, and they were as good as ever were eaten. At noon, this day, I ob&s;erved the &s;un's meridional zenith di&s;tance by an a&s;trono|mical quadrant, which gave the latitude 36&deg; 47&prime; 43" within the &s;outh entrance of the bay.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on &s;hore, and collected a great variety of plants, altogether unknown, and not return|ing till the evening, had an opportunity of ob&s;erving in what manner the Indians di&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves to pa&s;s the night. They had no &s;helter but a few &s;hrubs: the women and the children were ranged innermo&s;t, or farthe&s;t from the &s;ea; the men lay in a kind of half circle round them, and their arms were &s;et up again&s;t the trees clo&s;e by them, in a manner which &s;howed that they were afraid of an attack by &s;ome ene|my not far di&s;tant. It was al&s;o di&s;covered that they acknow|ledged neither Teratu, nor any other per&s;on as their king: as in this particular they differed from all the people that we had &s;een upon other parts of the coa&s;t, we thought it po&s;&s;ible that they might be a &s;et of outlaws, in a &s;tate of rebellion again&s;t Teratu, and in that ca&s;e they might have no &s;ettled habitations, or cultivated land in any part of the country.</P>
<P>On the 9th, at day-break, a great number of canoes came
<PB N="212" REF="013324_0239_0F8FFBB4C70DADE8">
on board, loaded with mackrel of two &s;orts, one exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e caught in England, and the other &s;omewhat different: we imagined the people had taken a large &s;hoal, and brought us an overplus which they could not con&s;ume; for they &s;old them at a very low rate. They were, however, very welcome to us; at eight o'clock the &s;hip had more fi&s;h on board than all her people could eat in three days; and be|fore night the quantity was &s;o much increa&s;ed, that every man who could get &s;alt, cured as many as would la&s;t him a month.</P>
<P>After an early breakfa&s;t, I went a&s;hore with Mr. Green and proper in&s;truments, to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of Mercury, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander being of the party; the weather had for &s;ome time been very thick, with much rain, but this day was &s;o favourable that not a cloud intervened during the whole tran&s;it. The ob&s;ervation of the ingre&s;s was made by Mr. Green alone, while I was employed in taking the &s;un's alti|tude to a&s;certain the time. It came on at 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 20&prime; 58" apparent time: according to Mr. Green's ob&s;ervation, the internal contact was at 12^h 8&prime; 58&Prime;, the external at 12h 9&prime; 55&Prime; P. M. And according to mine, the internal contact was at 12h 8&prime; 54&Prime;, and the external 12h 9&prime; 48&Prime;; the latitude of the place of ob|&s;ervation was 30&deg;. 48&prime; 5&frac12; &Prime;. The latitude ob&s;erved at noon was 36&deg;. 48&prime; 28&Prime;. The mean of this and ye&s;terday's ob&s;erva|tion gives 36&deg;, 48&prime; 5&frac12; &Prime; S. the latitude of the place of ob&s;erva|tion; the variation of the compa&s;s was 11&deg; 9&prime; E.</P>
<P>About noon we were alarmed by the firing of a great gun from the &s;hip; Mr. Gore, my Second Lieutenant, was at this time commanding officer on board, and the account that he gave was this. While &s;ome &s;mall canoes were trading with the people, two very large ones came up, full of men, one of them having on board forty-&s;even, all armed with pikes, darts, and &s;tones, and apparently with an ho&s;tile intention: they appeared to be &s;trangers, and to be rather con&s;cious of &s;uperiority over us by their numbers, than afraid of any wea|pons which could give us the &s;uperiority over them: no at|tack however was made; probably becau&s;e they learnt from the people in the other canoes, with whom they immediately entered into conference, what kind of an enemy they had to deal with: after a little time, they began to trade, &s;ome of them offering their arms, and one of them a &s;quare piece of cloth, which makes a part of their dre&s;s, called a <HI>Haahow;</HI> &s;everal of the weapons were purcha&s;ed, and Mr. Gore having agreed for a Haahow, &s;ent down the price, which was a piece of Briti&s;h cloth, and expected his purcha&s;e: but the Indian, as &s;oon as he got Mr. Gore's cloth in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, refu&s;ed to part with his own, and put off the canoe: upon being threa|tened for this fraud, he and his companions began to &s;ing their
<PB N="213" REF="013324_0240_0F8FFBB5E7C9F578">
war &s;ong in defiance, and &s;hook their paddles: &s;till however they began no attack, only defying Mr. Gore to take any re|medy in his power, which &s;o provoked him that he levelled a mu&s;quet loaded with ball at the offender, while he was hold|ing the cloth in his hand, and &s;hot him dead. It would have been happy, if the effect of a few &s;mall &s;hot had been tried upon this occa&s;ion, which upon &s;ome others had been &s;ucce&s;s|ful.</P>
<P>When the Indian dropped, all the canoes put off to &s;ome di&s;tance; but as they did not go away, it was thought they might &s;till meditate an attack. To &s;ecure therefore a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age for the boat, which it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end on &s;hore, a round &s;hot was fired over their heads, which effectually an|&s;wered the purpo&s;e, and put them all to flight. When an ac|count of what happened was brought a&s;hore, our Indians were alarmed, and drawing all together, retreated in a body. Af|ter a &s;hort time, however, they returned, having heard a more particular account of the affair; and intimated that they thought the man who had been killed de&s;erved his fate.</P>
<P>A little before &s;un&s;et the Indians retired to eat their &s;upper, and we went with them to be &s;pectators of the repa&s;t; it con|&s;i&s;ted of fi&s;h of different kinds, among which were lob&s;ters, and &s;ome birds, of a &s;pecies unknown to us: the&s;e were either roa&s;ted or baked; to roa&s;t them, they fa&s;tened them upon a &s;mall &s;tick, which was &s;tuck up in the ground, inclining to|wards their fire; and to bake them they put them into a hole in the ground with hot &s;tones, in the &s;ame manner as the people of Otaheite.</P>
<P>Among the natives that were a&s;&s;embled upon this occa&s;ion, we &s;aw a woman, who, after their manner, was mourning for the death of her relation: &s;he &s;at upon the ground near the re&s;t, who, only one excepted, &s;eemed not at all to regard her: the tears con&s;tantly trickled down her cheeks, and &s;he repeated in a low, but very mournful voice, words, which even Tupia did not at all under&s;tand: at the end of every &s;entence &s;he cut her arms, her face, or her brea&s;t with a &s;hell that &s;he held in her hand, &s;o that &s;he was almo&s;t covered with blood, and was indeed one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;pectacles that can be conceived. The cuts, however, did not appear to be &s;o deep as are &s;ometimes made upon &s;imilar occa&s;ions, if we may judge by the &s;cars which we &s;aw upon the arms, thighs, brea&s;ts, and cheeks of many of them, which we were told were the remains of wounds which they had inflicted upon them&s;elves as te&s;timonies of their affection and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>The next day I went with two boats, accompanied by Mr. Banks and the other Gentlemen, to examine a large river that empties it&s;elf into the head of the bay. We rowed about four or five miles up, and could have gone much farther if the
<PB N="214" REF="013324_0241_0F8FFBB6D36DADB8">
weather had been favourable. It was here wider than at the mouth, and divided into many &s;treams by &s;mall flat i&s;lands, which are covered with mangroves, and overflowed at high water. From the&s;e trees exudes a vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance which very much re&s;embles re&s;in: we found it fir&s;t in &s;mall lumps upon the &s;ea beach, and now &s;aw it &s;ticking to the trees, by which we knew whence it came. We landed on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, where we &s;aw a tree upon which &s;everal &s;hags had built their ne&s;ts, and here therefore we determined to dine; twenty of the &s;hags were &s;oon killed, and being broiled upon the &s;pot, afforded us an excellent meal. We then went upon the hills, from whence, I thought, I &s;aw the head of the ri|ver. The &s;hore on each &s;ide, as well as the i&s;lands in the middle, were covered with Mangroves; and the &s;and banks abounded in cockles and clams: in many places there were rock oy&s;ters, and every where plenty of wild fowl, principally &s;hags, ducks, curlieus, and the &s;ea-pie, that has been de&s;crib|ed before. We al&s;o &s;aw fi&s;h in the river, but of what kind we could not di&s;cover: the country on the ea&s;t &s;ide of this ri|ver is for the mo&s;t part barren, and de&s;titute of wood; but on the we&s;t it has a better a&s;pect, and in &s;ome places is adorned with trees, but has in no part the appearance of cultivation. In the entrance of the river, and for two or three miles up, there is good anchoring in four and five fathom water, and places very convenient for laying a ve&s;&s;el on &s;hore, where the tide ri&s;es and falls &s;even feet at the full and change of the moon. We could not determine, whether any con&s;iderable &s;tream of fre&s;h water came into this river out of the country; but we &s;aw a number of &s;mall rivulets i&s;&s;ue from the adjacent hills. Near the mouth of this river, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, we found a little Indian village, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall temporary &s;heds, where we landed, and were received by the people with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality: they treated us with a flat &s;hell-fi&s;h of a mo&s;t delicious ta&s;te, &s;omewhat like a cockle, which we eat hot from the coals. Near this place is a high point or penin&s;ula, projecting into the river, and upon it are the remains of a fort, which they call <HI>Eppah</HI> or <HI>Heppah.</HI> The be&s;t engineer in Europe could not have cho&s;en a &s;ituation better adapted to enable a &s;mall number to defend them&s;elves again&s;t a greater. The &s;teepne&s;s of the cliffs ren|ders it wholly inacce&s;&s;ible from the water which enclo&s;es it on three &s;ides; and, to the land, it is fortified by a ditch, and a bank rai&s;ed on the in&s;ide: from the top of the bank to the bottom of the ditch, is two and twenty feet; the ditch on the out&s;ide is fourteen feet deep, and its breadth is in proportion. The whole &s;eemed to have been executed with great judg|ment; and there had been a row of pickets or pali&s;adoes, both on the top of the bank and along the brink of the ditch
<PB N="215" REF="013324_0242_0F8FFBB711CA13C0">
on the out&s;ide; tho&s;e on the out&s;ide had been driven very deep into the ground, and were inclined towards the ditch, &s;o as to project over it; out of the&s;e the thicke&s;t po&s;ts only were left, and upon them there were evident marks of fire, &s;o that the place had probably been taken and de&s;troyed by an enemy. If any occa&s;ion &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;hip to winter here, or &s;tay any time, tents might be built in this place, which is &s;ufficiently &s;pacious, with great convenience, and might ea&s;ily be made impregnable to the whole country.</P>
<P>On the eleventh, there was &s;o much wind and rain that no canoe came off; but the long-boat was &s;ent to fetch oy&s;ters from one of the beds which had been di&s;covered the day be|fore: the boat &s;oon returned, deeply laden, and the oy&s;ters, which were as good as ever came from Colche&s;ter, and about the &s;ame &s;ize, were laid down under the booms, and the &s;hip's company did nothing but eat them from the time they came on board till night, when, as may rea&s;onably be &s;up|po&s;ed, great part of them were expended; this, however, gave us no concern, as we knew that not the boat only, but the &s;hip might have been loaded, almo&s;t in one tide, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eds are dry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> half ebb.</P>
<P>In the morning of Sunday the 12th, two canoes came off full of people whom we had never &s;een before, but who ap|peared to have heard of us by the caution which they u&s;ed in approaching us. As we invited them to come along &s;ide with all the tokens of friend&s;hip that we could &s;hew, they ventured up, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of them came on board; the re&s;t traded very fairly for what they had: a &s;mall canoe al&s;o came from the other &s;ide of the bay, and &s;old us &s;ome very large fi&s;h, which they gave us to under&s;tand they would have brought ye&s;terday, having caught them the day before, but that the wind was &s;o high they could not venture to &s;ea.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t I went with the pinnace and yawl, accom|panied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, over to the north &s;ide of the bay, to take a view of the country, and two forti|fied villages, which we had di&s;covered at a di&s;tance. We landed near the &s;malle&s;t of them, the &s;ituation of which was the mo&s;t beautifully romantic that can be imagined; it was built upon a &s;mall rock, detached from the main, and &s;ur|rounded at high water. The whole body of this rock was perforated by an hollow or arch, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much the large&s;t part of it; the top of the arch was above &s;ixty feet perpendicular above the &s;ea, which at high water &s;lowed through the bottom of it: the whole &s;ummit of the rock above the arch was fenced round after their manner; but the area was not large enough to contain more than five or &s;ix hou&s;es: it was acce&s;&s;ible only by one very narrow and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> which the inhabitants, at our approach, came down,
<PB N="216" REF="013324_0243_0F8FFBB7CA5998E0">
and invited us into the place; but we refu&s;ed, intending to vi&s;it a much more con&s;iderable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of the &s;ame kind, about a mile's di&s;tance. We made &s;ome pre&s;ents however to the wo|men, and in the mean time we &s;aw the inhabitants of the town which we were going to, coming towards us in a body, men, women and children, to the number of about one hundred: when they came near enough to be heard, they waved their hand, and called out <HI>Horomai;</HI> after which they &s;at down among the bu&s;hes near the beach: the&s;e ceremonies we were told were certain &s;igns of their friendly di&s;po&s;ition. We ad|vanced to the place where they were &s;itting, and when we came up, made them a few pre&s;ents, and a&s;ked leave to vi&s;it their Heppah; they con&s;ented with joy in their countenances, and immediately led the way. It is called WHARRETOUWA, and is &s;ituated upon a high promontory or point, which pro|jects into the &s;ea, on the north &s;ide, and near the head of the bay: two &s;ides of it are wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, and the&s;e are alto|gether inacce&s;&s;ible; two other &s;ides are to the land: up one of them, which is very &s;teep, lies the avenue from the beach; the other is flat and open to the country upon the hill, which is a narrow ridge: the whole is inclo&s;ed by a palli&s;ade about ten feet high, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;trong pales, bound together with withes. The weak &s;ide next the land is al&s;o defended by a double ditch, the innermo&s;t of which has a bank, and an ad|ditional palli&s;ade; the inner palli&s;ades are upon the bank next the town, but at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the top of the bank as to leave room for men to walk and u&s;e their arms between them and the inner ditch: the outermo&s;t palli&s;ades are between the two ditches, and driven obliquely into the ground, &s;o that their upper ends incline over the ditch: the depth of this ditch, from the bottom to the top of the crown of the bank, is four and twenty feet. Clo&s;e within the innermo&s;t palli|&s;ade is a &s;tage, twenty feet high, forty feet long, and &s;ix broad; it is &s;upported by &s;trong po&s;ts, and is intended as a &s;tation for tho&s;e who defend the place, from which they may annoy the a&s;&s;ailants by darts and &s;tones, heaps of which lay ready for u&s;e. Another &s;tage of the &s;ame kind commands the &s;teep avenue from the beach, and &s;tands al&s;o within the pal|li&s;ade; on this &s;ide of the hill there are &s;ome little outworks and huts, not intended as advanced po&s;ts, but as the habi|tations of people who for want of room could not be accom|modated within the works, but who were, notwith&s;tanding, de&s;irous of placing them&s;elves under their protection. The palli&s;ades, as has been ob&s;erved already, run round the whole brow of the hill, as well towards the &s;ea, as towards the land; but the ground within having originally been a mount, they have reduced it not to one level, but to &s;everal, ri&s;ing in &s;tages one above the other, like an amphitheatre, each of which is
<PB N="217" REF="013324_0244_0F8FFBB8EC08E360">
inclo&s;ed within its &s;eparate palli&s;ade; they communicate with each other by narrow lanes, which might ea&s;ily be &s;topped up, &s;o that if an enemy &s;hould force the outward palli&s;ade, he would have others to carry before the place could be wholly reduced, &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e places to be ob&s;tinately defended one after the other. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> only entrance is by a narrow pa&s;&s;age, about twelve feet long, communicating with the &s;teep a&s;cent from the beach: it pa&s;&s;es under one of the fighting &s;tages, and though we &s;aw nothing like a door or gateway, it may be ea|&s;ily barricaded in a manner that will make the forcing it a very dangerous and difficult undertaking. Upon the whole, this mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a place of great &s;trength, in which a &s;mall number of re&s;olute men may defend them&s;elves again&s;t all the force which a people with no other arms than tho&s;e that are in u&s;e here could bring again&s;t it. It &s;eemed to be well furni&s;hed for a &s;iege with every thing but water; we &s;aw great quantities of fern root, which they eat as bread, and dried fi&s;h piled up in heaps; but we could not perceive that they had any fre&s;h water nearer than a brook, which runs clo&s;e under the foot of the hill, whether they have any means of getting it from this place during a &s;iege, or whether they have any method of &s;toring it within the works, in gourds, or other ve&s;&s;els, we could not learn; &s;ome re&s;ource they certainly have with re&s;pect to this article, an indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ary of life, for otherwi&s;e the laying up dry provi&s;ions could an&s;wer no purpo&s;e. Upon our expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to &s;ee their method of attack and defence, one of the young men mounted a &s;ight|ing &s;tage, which they call <HI>Porava,</HI> and another went into the ditch: both he that was to defend the place, and he that was to a&s;&s;ault it, &s;ung the war-&s;ong, and danced with the &s;ame frightful ge&s;ticulations that we had &s;een u&s;ed in more &s;erious circum&s;tances, to work them&s;elves up into a degree of that mechanical fury, which among all uncivilized nations, is the nece&s;&s;ary prelude to a battle; for di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate courage, a &s;trength of mind that can &s;urmount the &s;en&s;e of danger, without a flow of animal &s;pirits by which it is extingui&s;hed, &s;eems to be the prerogative of tho&s;e who have projects of more la&s;ting im|portance, and a keener &s;en&s;e of honour and di&s;grace, than can be formed or felt by men who have few pains or plea&s;ures be|&s;ides tho&s;e of mere animal life, and &s;carcely any purpo&s;e but to provide for the day that is pa&s;&s;ing over them, to obtain plun|der, or revenge an in&s;ult: they will march again&s;t each other indeed in cool blood, though they find it nece&s;&s;ary to work them&s;elves into pa&s;&s;ion before they engage; as among us there have been many in&s;tances of people who have deliberately made them&s;elves drunk, that they might execute a project which they formed when they were &s;ober, but which, while they continued &s;o, they did not dare to undertake.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="013324_0245_0F8FFBB954426E90">
On the &s;ide of the hill, near this inclo&s;ure, we &s;aw about half an acre planted with gourds and &s;weet potatoes, which was the only cultivation in the bay: under the foot of the point, upon which this fortification &s;tands, are two rocks, one ju&s;t broken off from the main, and the other not perfectly de|tached from it: they are both &s;mall, and &s;eem more proper for the habitations of birds than men; yet there are hou&s;es and places of defence upon each of them. And we &s;aw many other works of the &s;ame kind upon &s;mall i&s;lands, rocks, and ridges of hills, on different parts of the coa&s;t, be&s;ides many fortified towns, which appeared to be much &s;uperior to this.</P>
<P>The perpetual ho&s;tility in which the&s;e poor &s;avages, who have made every village a fort, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily live, will account for there being &s;o little of their land in a &s;tate of cul|tivation; and, as mi&s;chiefs very often reciprocally produce each other, it may perhaps appear, that there being &s;o little land in a &s;tate of cultivation, will account for their living in perpetual ho&s;tility. But it is very &s;trange, that the &s;ame in|vention and diligence which have been u&s;ed in the con&s;truc|tion of places &s;o admirably adapted to defence, almo&s;t without tools, &s;hould not, when urged by the &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity, have fur|ni&s;hed them with a &s;ingle mi&s;&s;ile weapon except the lance, which is thrown by hand: they have no contrivance like a bow to di&s;charge a dart, nor any thing like a &s;ling to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in throwing a &s;tone; which is the more &s;urpri&s;ing, as the invention of &s;lings, and bows and arrows, is much more obvious than the works which the&s;e people con&s;truct, and both the&s;e weapons are found among much ruder nations, and in almo&s;t every other part of the world. Be&s;ides the long lance and Patoo-Patoo, which have been mentioned already, they have a &s;taff about five-feet long, &s;ometimes pointed, like a Ser|jeant's halberd, &s;ometimes only tapering to a point at one end, and having the other end broad, and &s;haped &s;omewhat like the blade of an oar. They have al&s;o another weapon, about a foot &s;horter than the&s;e, pointed at one end, and at the other &s;haped like an axe. The points of their long lances are barbed, and they handle them with &s;uch &s;trength and agility, that we can match them with no weapon but a loaded mu&s;quet.</P>
<P>After taking a &s;light view of the country, and loading both the boats with celery, which we found in great plenty near the beach, we returned from our excur&s;ion, and about five o'clock in the evening got on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 15th, I &s;ailed out of the bay, and at the &s;ame time had &s;everal canoes on board, in one of which was our friend Toiava, who &s;aid, that as &s;oon as we were gone he mu&s;t re|pair to his Heppah, or fort, becau&s;e the friends of the man who had been &s;hot by Mr. Gore on the 9th, had threatened to revenge his death upon him, whom they had reproached as
<PB N="219" REF="013324_0246_0F90F2BF13470B18">
being our friend. Off the north point off the bay, I &s;aw a great number of i&s;lands, of various extent, which lay &s;cat|tered to the north we&s;t, in a direction parallel with the main as far as I could &s;ee. I &s;teered north ea&s;t for the north ea&s;ter|mo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands; but the wind coming to the north we&s;t, I was obliged to &s;tand out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>To the bay which we had now left I gave the name of MER|CURY BAY, on account of the ob&s;ervation which we had made there of the tran&s;it of that planet over the &s;un. It lies in la|titude 36&deg; 47&prime; S.; and in the longitude of 184&deg; 4&prime; W.: there are &s;everal i&s;lands lying both to the &s;outhward and northward of it, and a &s;mall i&s;land or rock in the middle of the entrance: within this i&s;land the depth of water no where exceeds nine fathom: the be&s;t anchoring is in a &s;andy bay, which lies ju&s;t within the &s;outh head, in five and four fathom, bringing a high tower or rock, which lies without the head, in one with the head, or ju&s;t &s;hut in behind it. This place is very con|venient both for wooding and watering, and in the river there is an immen&s;e quantity of oy&s;ters, and other &s;hell-fi&s;h: I have for this rea&s;on given it the name of OYSTER RIVER. But for a &s;hip that wants to &s;tay here any time, the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t place is in the river, at the head of the bay; which, from the number of mangrove trees about it, I have called MANGROVE RIVER. To &s;ail into this river, the &s;outh &s;hore mu&s;t be kept all the way on board. The country on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river and bay is very barren, its only produce being fern, and a few other plants that will grow in a poor &s;oil. The land on the north we&s;t &s;ide is covered with wood, and the &s;oil being much more fertile, would doubtle&s;s produce all the nece&s;&s;aries of life with proper cultivation: it is not how|ever &s;o fertile as the lands that we have &s;een to the &s;outhward; nor do the inhabitants, though numerous, make &s;o good an appearance: they have no plantations; their canoes are mean, and without ornament; they &s;leep in the open air; and &s;ay, that Teratu, who&s;e &s;overeignty they do not acknowledge, if he was to come among them, would kill them. This fa|voured our opinion of their being outlaws; yet they told us, that they had Heppahs, or &s;trong holds, to which they re|tired in time of imminent danger.</P>
<P>We found, thrown upon the &s;hore, in &s;everal parts of this bay, great quantities of iron-&s;and, which is brought down by every little rivulet of fre&s;h water that finds its way from the country; which is a demon&s;tration that there is ore of that metal not far inland: yet neither the inhabitants of this place, or any other part of the coa&s;t that we have &s;een, know the u&s;e of iron, or &s;et the lea&s;t value upon it; all of them preferring the mo&s;t worthle&s;s and u&s;ele&s;s, not only to a nail, but to any tool of that metal.</P>

Before we left the bay, we cut upon one of the trees near the watering-place the &s;hip's name, and that of the Com|mander, with the date of the year and month when we were there; and after di&s;playing the Engli&s;h colours, I took a for|mal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of his Britannic Maje&s;ty King George the Third.</P>

<P>I Continued plying to windward two days, to get under the land, and on the 18th, about &s;even in the morning, we were abrea&s;t of a very con&s;picuous promontory, being then in latitude 36&deg; 26&prime;, and in the direction of N. 48 W. from the north head of Mercury bay, or Point Mercury, which was di&s;tant nine leagues: upon this point &s;tood many people, who &s;eemed to take little notice of us, but talked together with great earne&s;tne&s;s. In about half an hour, &s;everal ca|noes put off from the different places, and came towards the &s;hip; upon which the people on the point al&s;o launched a ca|noe, and about twenty of them came in her up with the others. When two of the&s;e canoes, in which there might be about &s;ixty men, came near enough to make them&s;elves heard, they &s;ung their war-&s;ong; but &s;eeing that we took little notice of it, they threw a few &s;tones at us, and then rowed off towards the &s;hore. We hoped that we had now done with them, but in a &s;hort time they returned, as if with a fixed re&s;olution to provoke us into a battle, animating them&s;elves by their &s;ong, as they had done before. Tupia, without any directions from us, went to the poop, and began to expo&s;tulate: he told them that we had weapons which would de&s;troy them in a moment; and that if they ventured to attack us, we &s;hould be obliged to u&s;e them. Upon this they flouri&s;hed their weapons, and cried out in their language, "Come on &s;hore, and we will kill you all:" Well, &s;aid Tupia, but why &s;hould you mole&s;t us while we are at &s;ea? as we do not wi&s;h to fight, we &s;hall not accept your challenge to come on &s;hore; and here there is no pre|tence for a quarrel, the &s;ea being no more your property than the &s;hip. This eloquence of Tupia though it greatly &s;ur|pri&s;ed us, having given him no hints for the arguments he u&s;ed, had no effect upon our enemies, who very &s;oon renewed
<PB N="221" REF="013324_0248_0F8FFBBAC9AC70C0">
their battery: a mu&s;quet was then fired through one of their boats, and this was an argument of &s;ufficient weight, for they immediately fell a&s;tern and left us.</P>
<P>From the point, of which we were now abrea&s;t, the land trends W. &frac12; S. near a league, and then S. S. E. as far as we could &s;ee; and, be&s;ides the i&s;lands that lay without us, we could &s;ee land round by the S. W. as far as the N. W.; but whether this was the main or i&s;lands, we could not then de|termine: the fear of lo&s;ing the main, however, made me re|&s;olve to follow its direction. With this view, I hauled round the point and &s;teered to the &s;outhward, but there being light airs all round the compa&s;s, we made but little progre&s;s.</P>
<P>About one o'clock, a breeze &s;prung up at ea&s;t, which af|terwards came to N. E. and we &s;teered along the &s;hore S. by E. and S. S. E. having from twenty-five to eighteen fathom.</P>
<P>At about half an hour after &s;even in the evening, having run &s;even or eight leagues &s;ince noon, I anchored in twenty-three fathom, not chu&s;ing to run any farther in the dark, as I had now land on both &s;ides, forming the entrance of a &s;treight, bay, or river, lying S. by E. for on that point we could &s;ee no land.</P>
<P>At day-break, on the 19th, the wind being &s;till favourable, we weighed and &s;tood with an ea&s;y &s;ail up the inlet, keeping neare&s;t to the ea&s;t &s;ide. In a &s;hort time, two large canoes came off to us from the &s;hore; the people on board &s;aid, that they knew Toiava very well, and called Tupia by his name. I invited &s;ome of them on board; and as they knew they had nothing to fear from us, while they behaved hone&s;tly and peaceably, they immediately complied: I made each of them &s;ome pre&s;ents, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them much gratified. Other ca|noes afterwards came up to us from a different &s;ide of the bay; and the people on board of the&s;e al&s;o mentioned the name of Toiava, and &s;ent a young man into the &s;hip, who told us he was his grand&s;on, and he al&s;o was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>After having run about five leagues from the place where we had anchored the night before, our depth of water gradu|ally decrea&s;ed to &s;ix fathom; and not chu&s;ing to go into le&s;s, as it was tide of flood, and the wind blew right up the in|let, I came to an anchor about the middle of the channel, which is near eleven miles over; after which I &s;ent two boats out to &s;ound, one on one &s;ide, and the other on the other.</P>
<P>The boats not having found above three feet more water than we were now in, I determined to go no farther with the &s;hip, but to examine the head of the bay in the boats; for, as it appeared to run a good way inland, I thought this a fa|vourable opportunity to examine the interior part of the coun|try, and its produce.</P>
<P>At day-break, therefore, I &s;et out in the pinnace and long-boat,
<PB N="223" REF="013324_0249_0F8FFBBCEC824D68">
accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia; and we found the inlet end in a river, about nine miles above the &s;hip: into this river we entered with the fir&s;t of the flood, and within three miles found the water perfectly fre&s;h. Be|fore we had proceeded more than one third of that di&s;tance, we found an Indian town, which was built upon a &s;mall bank of dry &s;and, but intirely &s;urrounded by a deep mud, which po&s;|&s;ibly the inhabitants might con&s;ider as a defence. The&s;e people as &s;oon as they &s;aw us, thronged to the banks, and in|vited us on &s;hore. We accepted the invitation, and made them a vi&s;it notwith&s;tanding the mud. They received us with open arms, having heard of us from our good old friend Toiava; but our &s;tay could not be long, as we had other objects of curio&s;ity in view. We proceeded up the river till near noon, when we were fourteen miles within its entrance; and then finding the face of the country to continue nearly the &s;ame, without any alteration in the cour&s;e of the &s;tream, which we had no hope of tracing to its &s;ource, we landed on the we&s;t-&s;ide, to take a view of the lofty trees which every where adorn|ed its banks. They were of a kind that we had &s;een before, though only at a di&s;tance, both in Poverty Bay and Hawke's Bay. Before we had walked an hundred yards into the wood, we met with one of them which was nineteen feet eight inches in the girt, at the height of 6 feet above the ground: having a quadrant with me, I mea&s;ured its height from the root to the fir&s;t branch, and found it to be eighty-nine feet: it was as &s;trait as an arrow, and tapered but very little in proportion to its height; &s;o that I judged there were three hundred and fifty-&s;ix feet of &s;olid timber in it, exclu&s;ive of the branches. As we advanced, we &s;aw many others that were &s;till larger; we cut down a young one, and the wood proved heavy and &s;olid, not fit for ma&s;ts, but &s;uch as would make the fine&s;t plank in the world. Our carpenter, who was with us, &s;aid that the timber re&s;embled that of pitch-pine, which is lighten|ed by tapping; and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome &s;uch method might be found to lighten the&s;e, and they would then be &s;uch ma&s;ts as no country in Europe can produce. As the wood was &s;wam|py, we could not range far; but we found many &s;tout trees of other kinds, all of them utterly unknown to us, &s;pecimens of which we brought away.</P>
<P>The river at this height is as broad as the Thames at Green|wich, and the tide of flood as &s;trong; it is not indeed quite &s;o deep, but has water enough for ve&s;&s;els of more than a middle &s;ize, and a bottom of mud, &s;o &s;oft that nothing could take damage by running a&s;hore.</P>
<P>About three o'clock, we reimbarked, in order to return with the fir&s;t of the ebb, and named the river the THAMES, it having &s;ome re&s;emblance to our own river of that name.
<PB N="224" REF="013324_0250_0F8FFBBE16435F10">
In our return, the inhabitants of the village where we had been a&s;hore, &s;eeing us take another channel, came off to us in their canoes, and trafficked with us in the mo&s;t friendly manner, till they had di&s;po&s;ed of the few trifles they had. The tide of ebb ju&s;t carried us out of the narrow part of the river, into the channel that run up from the &s;ea, before it was dark; and we pulled hard to reach the &s;hip, but meet|ing the flood, and a &s;trong breeze at N. N. W. with &s;howers of rain, we were obliged to de&s;i&s;t; and about midnight, we run under the land, and came to a grappling, where we took &s;uch re&s;t as our &s;ituation would admit. At break of day, we &s;et forward again, and it was pa&s;t &s;even o'clock before we reached the &s;hip. We were all extremely tired, but thought our&s;elves happy to be on board; for before nine it blew &s;o hard that the boat could not have rowed ahead, and mu&s;t therefore either have gone a&s;hore, or taken &s;helter under it.</P>
<P>About three o'clock, having the tide of ebb, we took up our anchor, made &s;ail, and plied down the river till eight in the evening, when we came to an anchor again: early in the morning we made &s;ail with the fir&s;t ebb, and kept plying till the flood obliged us once more to come to an anchor. As we had now only a light breeze, I went in the pinnace, accom|panied by Dr. Solander, to the we&s;tern &s;hore; but I &s;aw no|thing worthy of notice.</P>
<P>When I left the &s;hip, many canoes were about it; Mr. Banks therefore cho&s;e to &s;tay on board, and traffic with the natives: they bartered their clothes and arms, chiefly for pa|per, and behaved with great friend&s;hip and hone&s;ty. But while &s;ome of them were below with Mr. Banks, a young man who was upon the deck &s;tole a half minute gla&s;s, which was in the binnacle, and was detected ju&s;t as he was carrying it off. Mr. Hicks, who was commanding officer on board, took it into his head to puni&s;h him, by giving him twelve la&s;hes with a cat-o'nine-tails; and accordingly ordered him to be taken to the gang-way, and tied up to the &s;hrouds. When the other Indians who were on board &s;aw him &s;eized, they at|tempted to re&s;cue him; and being re&s;i&s;ted, called for their arms, which were handed up from the canoes, and the people of one of them attempted to come up the &s;hip's &s;ide. The tumult was heard by Mr. Banks, who, with Tupia, came ha&s;tily upon the deck to &s;ee what had happened. The In|dians ran immediately to Tupia, who, finding Mr. Hicks in|exorable, could only a&s;&s;ure them, that nothing was intended again&s;t the life of their companion; but that it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould &s;uffer &s;ome puni&s;hment for his offence, which being explained to them, they &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied. The puni&s;h|ment was then inflicted, and as &s;oon as the criminal was unbound, an old man among the &s;pectators, who was &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="225" REF="013324_0251_0F8FFBBF07AE6670">
to be his father, gave him a hearty beating, and &s;ent him down into his canoe. All the canoes then dropped a|&s;tern, and the people &s;aid that they were afraid to come any more near the &s;hip: after much per&s;ua&s;ion, however, they ventured back again, but their cheerful confidence was at an end, and their &s;tay was &s;hort; they promi&s;ed indeed, at their departure, to return with &s;ome fi&s;h, but we &s;aw no more of them.</P>
<P>On the 23, the wind being contrary, we kept plying down the river, and at &s;even in the evening, got without the N. W. point of the i&s;lands lying on the we&s;t &s;ide of it. The weather being bad, night coming on, and having land on every &s;ide of us, I thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to tack, and &s;tretch in under the point, where we anchored in nineteen fa|thom. At five in the morning, of the 24th, we weighed, and made &s;ail to the N. W. under our cour&s;es and double reefed top-&s;ails, the wind being at S. W. by W. and W. S. W. a &s;trong gale and &s;qually. As the gale would not permit us to come near the land, we had but a &s;light and di&s;tant view of it from the time we got under &s;ail till noon, during our run of twelve leagues, but we never once lo&s;t &s;ight of it. At this time, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 36&deg; 15&prime; 20&Prime;, we were not above two miles from a point of land on the main, and three leagues and half from a very high i&s;land, which bore N. E. by E.: in this &s;ituation we had twenty-&s;ix fathom water: the farthe&s;t point on the main that we could &s;ee bore N. W. but we could perceive &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands lying to the north of that direction. The point of land of which we were now a-brea&s;t, and which I called POINT RODNEY, is the N. W. extremity of the river Thames; for under that name I comprehend the deep bay which terminates in the fre&s;h water &s;tream, and the N. E. extremity is the promontory which we pa&s;&s;ed when we entered it, and which I called CAPE COLVILLE, in honour of the Right Honour able Lord Colville.</P>
<P>Cape Colville lies in latitude 36&deg; 26&prime;, longitude 194&deg; 27&prime;; it ri&s;es directly from the &s;ea to a con&s;iderable height, and is remarkable for a lofty rock, which &s;tands to the pitch of the point, and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed at a very great di&s;tance. From the &s;outh point of this Cape the river runs in a direct line S. by E. and is no where le&s;s than three leagues broad for the di&s;tance of fourteen leagues above the Cape, and there it is contracted to a narrow &s;tream, but continues the &s;ame cour&s;e through a low flat country, or broad valley, which lies parallel with the &s;ea coa&s;t, and the end of which we could not &s;ee. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the broad part of this river the land is tolerably high and hilly; on the we&s;t &s;ide it is rather low, but the whole is covered with verdure and
<PB N="226" REF="013324_0252_0F8FFBBF58356340">
wood, and has the appearance of great fertility, though there were but a few &s;mall &s;pots which had been cultivated. At the entrance of the narrow part of the river the land is covered with mangroves and other &s;hrubs; but farther, there are immen&s;e woods of perhaps the fine&s;t timber in the world, of which &s;ome account has already been given: in &s;everal places the wood extends to the very edge of the water, and where it is at a little di&s;tance, the intermediate &s;pace is mar|&s;hy, like &s;ome parts of the banks of the Thames in England: it is probable that the river contains plenty of fi&s;h, for we &s;aw poles &s;tuck up in many places to &s;et nets for catching them, but of what kind I do not know. The greate&s;t depth of wa|ter that we found in this river was &s;ix and twenty fathom, which gradually decrea&s;ed to one fathom and an half: in the mouth of the fre&s;h water &s;tream it is from four to three fa|thom, but there are large flats and &s;and banks lying before it. A &s;hip of moderate draught may, notwith&s;tanding, go a long way up this river with a flowing tide, for it ri&s;es per|pendicularly near ten feet, and at the full and change of the moon, it is high water about nine o'clock.</P>
<P>Six leagues within Cape Colville, under the ea&s;tern &s;hore, are &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, which, together with the main, &s;eem to form good harbours; and oppo&s;ite to the&s;e i&s;lands, under the we&s;tern &s;hore, lie other i&s;lands, by which it is al&s;o probable that good harbours may be formed: but if there are no harbours about this river, there is good anchoring in every part of it where the depth of water is &s;ufficient, for it is defended from the &s;ea by a chain of i&s;lands of different ex|tent, which lie cro&s;s the mouth of it, and which I have, for that rea&s;on, called BARRIER ISLANDS, they &s;tretch N. W. and S. E. ten leagues. The &s;outh end of the chain lies N. E. between two and three leagues from Cape Colville; and the north end lies N. E. four leagues and an half from Point Rodney. Point Rodney lies W N. W. nine leagues from Cape Colville, in latitude 36&deg; 15&prime; S. longitude 184&deg; 53&prime; W.</P>
<P>The natives re&s;iding about this river do not appear to be numerous, con&s;idering the great extent of the country. But they are a &s;trong, well-made, and active people, and all of them paint their bodies with red oker and oil from head to foot, which we had not &s;een before. Their canoes were large and well built, and adorned with carving, in as good a ta&s;te as any that we had &s;een upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand along the &s;hore till night, with the main land on one &s;ide, and i&s;lands on the other, and then anchored in a bay, with fourteen fathom and a &s;andy bot|tom. We had no &s;ooner come to an anchor, than we tried our lines, and in a &s;hort time caught near one hundred fi&s;h, which the people called Sea-bream; they weighed from &s;ix
<PB N="227" REF="013324_0253_0F8FFBC00D39C1E8">
to eight pounds a piece, and con&s;equently would &s;upply the whole &s;hip's company with food for two days. From the &s;ucce&s;s of our lines here, we called the place BREAM BAY: the two points that form it lie north and &s;outh, five leagues from each other; it is every where of a good breadth, and between three and four leagues deep: at the bottom of it there appears to be a river of fre&s;h water. The north head of the bay, called BREAM HEAD, is high land, and remark|able for &s;everal pointed rocks, which &s;tand in a range upon the top of it: it may al&s;o be known by &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands which lie before it, called the HEN AND CHICKENS, one of which is high, and terminates in two peaks. It lies in lati|tude 35&deg; 46&prime; S., and at the di&s;tance of &s;eventeen leagues and an half from Cape Colville, in the direction of N. 41 W.</P>
<P>The land between Point Rodney and Bream Head, an ex|tent of ten leagues, is low, and wooded in tufts, with white &s;and banks between the &s;ea and the firm land. We &s;aw no inhabitants, but many fires in the night, and where there are fires, there are always people.</P>
<P>At day-break, on the 25th, we left the bay, and &s;teered along &s;hore to the northward: we found the variation of the compa&s;s to be 12&deg; 42&prime; E. At noon, our latitude was 36&deg; 36&prime; S., Bream Head bore &s;outh, di&s;tant ten miles; and we &s;aw &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands, to which I gave the name of the POOR KNIGHTS, at N. E. by N. di&s;tant three leagues; the nor|thermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. N. W.: we were in this place at the di&s;tance of two miles from the &s;hore, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d had twenty-&s;ix fathom water.</P>
<P>The country appeared low, but well covered with wood: we &s;aw &s;ome &s;traggling hou&s;es, three or four fortified towns, and near them a large quantity of cultivated land.</P>
<P>In the evening, &s;even large canoes came off to us, with about two hundred men: &s;ome of them came on board, and &s;aid that they had heard of us. To two of them, who ap|peared to be Chiefs, I gave pre&s;ents; but when the&s;e were gone out of the &s;hip, the others became exceedingly trouble|&s;ome. Some of tho&s;e in the canoes began to trade, and, ac|cording to their cu&s;tom, to cheat, by refu&s;ing to deliver what had been bought, after they had received the price: among the&s;e was one who had received an old pair of black breeches, which, upon a few &s;mall &s;hot being fired at him, he threw into the &s;ea. All the boats &s;oon after paddled off to &s;ome di&s;tance, and when they thought they were out of reach, they began to defy us, by &s;inging their &s;ong and brandi&s;hing their weapons. We thought it advi&s;eable to intimidate them, as well for their &s;akes as our own, and therefore fired fir&s;t &s;ome &s;mall arms, and then round &s;hot over their heads; the la&s;t put them in a terrible fright,
<PB N="228" REF="013324_0253_0F8FFBC00D39C1E8">
though they received no damage, except by over-heating them&s;elves in paddling away, which they did with a&s;toni&s;h|ing expedition.</P>
<P>In the night we had variable light airs; but towards the morning a breeze &s;prung up at S. and afterwards at S. E. with which we proceeded &s;lowly to the northward, along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Between &s;ix and &s;even o'clock two canoes came off, and told us that they had heard of ye&s;terday's adventure, not|with&s;tanding which the people came on board, and traded very quietly and hone&s;tly for whatever they had: &s;oon after two canoes came off from a more di&s;tant part of the &s;hore; the&s;e were of a much larger &s;ize, and full of people, when they came near, they called off the other canoes which were along &s;ide of the &s;hip, and after a &s;hort conference they all came up together. The &s;trangers appeared to be per&s;ons of a &s;uperior rank; their canoes were well carved with many ornaments, and they had with them a great variety of wea|pons: they had patoo-patoos both of &s;tone and whalebone, upon which they appeared to &s;et a great value; they had al&s;o ribs of whale, of which we had before &s;een imitations in wood, carved and adorned with tufts of dog's hair. Their complexions were browner than tho&s;e of the people we had &s;een to the &s;outhward, and their bodies and faces were more marked with the black &s;tains which they call Amoco: they had a broad &s;piral on each buttock; and the thighs of many of them were almo&s;t entirely black, &s;ome narrow lines only being left untouched, &s;o that at fir&s;t &s;ight they appeared to wear &s;triped breeches. With re&s;pect to the Amoco, every different tribe &s;eemed to have a different cu&s;tom, for all the men, in &s;ome canoes, &s;eemed to be almo&s;t covered with it, and tho&s;e in others had &s;carcely a &s;tain, except on the lips, which were black in all of them without a &s;ingle exception. The&s;e gentlemen, for a long time, refu&s;ed to part with any of their weapons, whatever was offered for them; at la&s;t, however, one of them produced a piece of talc, wrought into the &s;hape of an ax, and agreed to &s;ell it for a piece of cloth: the cloth was handed over the &s;hip's &s;ide, but his ho|nour immediately put off his canoes with the ax. We had recour&s;e to our u&s;ual expedient, and fired a mu&s;ket ball over the canoe, upon which it put back to the &s;hip, and the piece of cloth was returned; all the boats then went a&s;hore, without offering any further intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>At noon, the main land extended from S. by E. to N. W. by W. a remarkable point of land bearing W. di&s;tant four or five miles; at three we pa&s;&s;ed it, and I gave it the name of CAPE BRET, in honour of Sir Piercy. The land of this cape is con&s;iderably higher than any part of the adjacent coa&s;t: at
<PB N="229" REF="013324_0255_0F8FFBC0E1DFBCD8">
the point of it, is a high round hillock, and N. E. by N. at the di&s;tance of about a mile, is a &s;mall high i&s;land or rock, which, like &s;everal that have already been de&s;cribed, was perforated quite through, &s;o as to appear like the arch of a bridge. This cape, or at lea&s;t &s;ome part of it, is by the na|tives called MOTUGOGOGO, and it lies in latitude 35&deg; 10&prime; 30&Prime; S. longitude 185&deg; 25&prime; W. On the we&s;t &s;ide of it is a large and pretty deep bay, lying in S. W. by W. in which there appeared to be &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands: the point that forms the N. W. entrance lies W. &frac14; N. at the di&s;tance of three or four leagues from Cape Bret, and I di&s;tingui&s;hed it by the name of POINT POCOCKE. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the bay we &s;aw &s;everal villages both upon i&s;lands and the main, and &s;e|veral very large canoes come off to us, full of people, who made a better appearance than any we had &s;een yet: they were all &s;tout and well made; their hair, which was black, was tied up in a bunch on the crown of their heads, and &s;tuck with white feathers. In each of the canoes were two or three chiefs, who&s;e habits were of the be&s;t &s;ort of cloth, and co|vered with dog's &s;kin, &s;o as to make an agreeable appearance; mo&s;t of the&s;e people were marked with the Amoco, like tho&s;e who had been along&s;ide of us before: their manner of trad|ing was al&s;o equally fradulent; and the officers neglecting either to puni&s;h or fright them, one of the mid&s;hipmen who had been defrauded in his bargain, had recour&s;e, for re|venge, to an expedient which was equally ludicrous and &s;e|vere: he got a fi&s;hing line, and when the man who had cheated him was clo&s;e under the &s;hip's &s;ide in his canoe, he heaved the lead with &s;o good an aim that the hook caught him by the back&s;ide; he then pulled the line, and the man holding back, the hook broke in the &s;hank, and the beard was left &s;ticking in the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this day, though we did not range more than &s;ix or eight leagues of the coa&s;t, we had along|&s;ide and on board the &s;hip between four and five hundred of the natives, which is a proof that this part of the country is well inhabited.</P>
<P>At eight o'clock the next morning, we were within a mile of a group of i&s;lands which lie clo&s;e under the main, at the di&s;tance of two and twenty miles from Cape Bret, in the di|rection of N W. by W. &frac12; W. At this place, having but little wind, we lay about two hours, during which time &s;e|veral canoes came off, and &s;old us &s;ome fi&s;h, which we called Cavalles, and for that rea&s;on I gave the &s;ame name to the i&s;lands. The&s;e people were very in&s;olent, frequently threat|ening us, even while they were &s;elling their fi&s;h; and when &s;ome more canoes came up, they began to pelt us with &s;tones. Some &s;mall &s;hot were then fired, and hit one of them while he had a &s;tone in his hand, in the very action of throwing it into
<PB N="229" REF="013324_0256_0F8FFBC187170488">
the &s;hip: they did not, however, de&s;i&s;t, till &s;ome others had been wounded, and then they went away, and we &s;tood off to &s;ea.</P>
<P>The wind being directly again&s;t us, we kept plying to wind|ward till the 29th, when we had rather lo&s;t than gained ground; I therefore bore up for a bay, which lies to the we&s;t|ward of Cape Bret; at this time it was about two leagues to leeward of us; and about eleven o'clock we anchored under the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of one of the many i&s;lands which line it on the &s;outh ea&s;t, in four fathom and an half water; we &s;hoaled our water to this depth all at once, and if this had not hap|pened I &s;hould not have come to an anchor &s;o &s;oon. The ma&s;ter was immediately &s;ent out with two boats to &s;ound, and he &s;oon di&s;covered that we had got upon a bank, which runs out from the north we&s;t end of the i&s;land, and that on the out&s;ide of it there was from eight to ten fathom.</P>
<P>In the mean time the natives, to the number of near four hundred, crouded upon us in their canoes, and &s;ome of them were admitted on board: to one, who &s;eemed to be a chief, I gave a piece of broad cloth, and di&s;tributed &s;ome trifling pre|&s;ents among the re&s;t. I perceived that &s;ome of the&s;e people had been about the &s;hip when &s;he was off at &s;ea, and that they knew the power of our fire-arms, for the very &s;ight of a gun threw them into manife&s;t confu&s;ion: under this impre&s;|&s;ion they traded very fairly; but the people in one of the ca|noes took the opportunity of our being at dinner to tow away our buoy: a mu&s;ket was fired over them without effect, we then endeavoured to reach them with &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot, but they were too far off: by this time they had got the buoy into their canoe, and we were obliged to fire a mu&s;ket at them with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: this hit one of them, and they immediately threw the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over board: a round &s;hot was then fired over them, which &s;truck the water and went a&s;hore. Two or three of the canoes immediately landed their people, who ran about the beach, as we imagined, in &s;earch of the ball. Tupia called to them, and a&s;&s;ured them that while they were hone&s;t they &s;hould be &s;afe, and with a little per&s;ua&s;ion many of them re|turned to the &s;hip, and their behaviour was &s;uch as left us nor ea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that they intended to give us any far|ther trouble.</P>
<P>After the &s;hip was removed into deeper water, and pro|perly &s;ecured, I went with the pinnace and yawl, manned and armed, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and landed upon the i&s;land, which was about three quarters of a mile di&s;tant: we ob&s;erved the canoes which were about the &s;hip, did not follow us upon our leaving her, which we thought a good &s;ign; but we had no &s;ooner landed than they crouded to different parts of the i&s;land, and came on &s;hore.
<PB N="230" REF="013324_0257_0F8FFBC3C7D89350">
We were in a little cove, and in a few minutes were &s;urrounded by two or three hundred people, &s;ome ru&s;hing from behind the heads of the cove, and others appearing on the tops of the hills: they were all armed, but they came on in &s;o confu&s;ed and &s;traggling a manner that we &s;carcely &s;u&s;pected they meant us any harm, and we were determined that ho&s;tilities &s;hould not begin on our part. We marched towards them, and then drew a line upon the &s;and, between them and us, which we gave them to under&s;tand they were not to pa&s;s: at fir&s;t they continued quiet, but their weapons were held ready to &s;trike, and they &s;eemed to be rather irre&s;olute than peaceable. While we remained in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, another party of Indians came up, and now growing more bold as their number in|crea&s;ed, they began the dance and &s;ong, which are their pre|ludes to a battle: &s;till, however, they delayed the attack, but a party ran to each of our boats, and attempted to draw them on &s;hore; this &s;eemed to be the &s;ignal, for the people about us at the &s;ame time began to pre&s;s in upon our line: our &s;ituation was now become too critical for us to remain longer inactive, I therefore di&s;charged my mu&s;ket, which was loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, at one of the forwarde&s;t, and Mr. Banks and two of the men fired immediately afterwards: this made them fall back in &s;ome confu&s;ion, but one of the Chiefs, who was at the di&s;tance of about twenty yards, rallied them, and running forward waving his patoo-patoo, and calling loudly to his companions, led them to the charge. Dr. Solander, who&s;e piece was not yet di&s;charged, fired at this champion, who &s;topped &s;hort upon feeling the &s;hot, and then ran away with the re&s;t: they did not however di&s;per&s;e, but got together upon a ri&s;ing ground, and &s;eemed only to want &s;ome leader of re|&s;olution to renew their attack. As they were now beyond the reach of &s;mall &s;hot, we fired with ball, but as none of them took place they &s;till continued in a body, and in this &s;ituation we remained about a quarter of an hour: in the mean time the &s;hip, from whence a much greater number of Indians were &s;een than could be di&s;covered in our &s;ituation, brought her broad-&s;ide to bear, and intirely di&s;per&s;ed them, by firing a few &s;hot over their heads. In this &s;kirmi&s;h only two of the Indians were hurt with the &s;mall &s;hot, and not a &s;ingle life was lo&s;t, which would not have been the ca&s;e if I had not re&s;trained the men, who, either from fear, or the love of mi&s;chief, &s;hewed as much impatience to de&s;troy them as a &s;port&s;man to kill his game. When we were in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our cove, we laid down our arms, and began to gather celery, which grew here in great plenty: after a little time we recollected to have &s;een &s;ome of the people hide them&s;elves in a cave of one of the rocks, we therefore went towards the place, when an old Indian, who proved to be the Chief that I had pre&s;ented
<PB N="231" REF="013324_0258_0F8FFBC4E99E05B0">
with a piece of broad cloth in the morning, came out with his wife, and his brother, and in a &s;upplicating po&s;ture put them|&s;elves under our protection. We &s;poke kindly to them, and the old man then told us that he had another brother, who was one of tho&s;e that had been wounded by the &s;mall &s;hot, and enquired with much &s;olicitude and concern if he would die. We a&s;&s;ured him that he would not, and at the &s;ame time put into his hand both a mu&s;ket ball, and &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot, telling him, that tho&s;e only who were wounded with the ball would die, and that the others would recover; at the &s;ame time a&s;|&s;uring him, that if we were attacked again, we &s;hould cer|tainly defend our&s;elves with the ball, which would wound them mortally. Having now taken courage, they came and &s;at nown by us, and as a token of our perfect amity, we made them pre&s;ents of &s;uch trifles as we happened to have about us.</P>
<P>Soon after we re-imbarked in our boats, and having rowed to another cove in the &s;ame i&s;land, climbed a neighbouring hill, which commanded the country to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The pro&s;pect was very uncommon and romantic, con&s;i&s;ting of innumerable i&s;lands, which formed as many harbours, where the water was as &s;mooth as a mill-pool: we &s;aw al&s;o many towns, &s;cattered hou&s;es, and plantations, the country being much more populous than any we had &s;een. One of the towns was very near us, from which many of the Indians advanced, taking great pains to &s;hew us that they were unarmed, and in their ge&s;tures and countenances expre&s;&s;ing great meekne&s;s and humility. In the mean time &s;ome of our people, who, when the Indians were to be puni&s;hed for a fraud, a&s;&s;umed the in|exorable ju&s;tice of a Lycurgus, thought fit to break into one of their plantations, and dig up &s;ome potatoes: for this of|fence I ordered each of them to be puni&s;hed with twelve la&s;hes, after which two of them were di&s;charged; but the third, in|&s;i&s;ting that it was no crime in an Engli&s;hman to plunder an Indian plantation, though it was a crime in an Indian to de|fraud an Engli&s;hman of a nail, I ordered him back into his con|finement, from which I would not relea&s;e him till he had re|ceived fix la&s;hes more.</P>
<P>On the 30th, there being a dead calm, and no probability of our getting to &s;ea, I &s;ent the ma&s;ter, with two boats to &s;ound the harbour; and all the forenoon had &s;everal canoes about the &s;hip, who traded in a very fair and friendly man|ner. In the evening we went a&s;hore upon the main, where the people received us very cordially; but found nothing wor|thy of notice.</P>
<P>In this bay we were detained by contrary winds and calms &s;everal days, during which time our intercour&s;e with the natives was continued in the mo&s;t peaceable and friendly manner, they being frequently about the &s;hip, and we a&s;hore,
<PB N="232" REF="013324_0259_0F8FFBC5D17D14D0">
both upon the i&s;lands and the main. In one of our vi&s;its to the continent, an old man &s;hewed us the in&s;trument they u&s;e in &s;taining their bodies, which exactly re&s;embled tho&s;e that were employed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e at Otaheite. We &s;aw al|&s;o the man who was wounded in attempting to &s;teal our buoy: the ball had pa&s;&s;ed thro' the fle&s;hy part of his arm, and grazed his brea&s;t; but the wound, under the care of nature, the be&s;t &s;urgeon, and a &s;imple diet, the be&s;t nur&s;e, was in a good &s;tate, and &s;eemed to give the patient neither pain nor apprehen&s;ion. We &s;aw al&s;o the brother of our old chief, who had been wounded with &s;mall &s;hot in our &s;kirmi&s;h: they had &s;truck his thigh obliquely, and though &s;everal of them were &s;till in the fle&s;h, the wound &s;eemed to be attended with neither danger nor pain. We found among their plantations the <HI>morus papy|rifera,</HI> of which the&s;e people, as well as tho&s;e of Otaheite, make cloth; but here the plant &s;eems to be rare, and we &s;aw no pieces of the cloth large enough for any u&s;e but to wear by way of ornament in their ears.</P>
<P>Having one day landed in a very di&s;tant part of the bay, the people immediately fled, except one old man, who ac|companied us wherever we went, and &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with the little pre&s;ents we made him. We came at la&s;t to a little fort, built upon a &s;mall rock, which at high water was &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and acce&s;&s;ible only by a ladder: we perceived that he eyed us with a kind of re&s;tle&s;s &s;olicitude as we approached it, and upon our expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to enter it, he told us that his wife was there: he &s;aw that our curio|&s;ity was not dimini&s;hed by this intelligence, and after &s;ome he&s;itation, he &s;aid, if we would promi&s;e to offer no indecency he would accompany us: our promi&s;e was readily given, and he immediately led the way. The ladder con&s;i&s;ted of &s;teps fa&s;tened to a pole, but we found the a&s;cent both difficult and dangerous. When we entered we found three women, who, the moment they &s;aw us, bur&s;t into tears of terror and &s;ur|prize: &s;ome kind words and a few pre&s;ents &s;oon removed their apprehen&s;ions, and put them into good humour. We examined the hou&s;e of our old friend, and by his intere&s;t two others, which were all that the fortification contained, and having di&s;tributed a few more pre&s;ents, we parted with mutual &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the morning of the 5th of December, we weighed, with a light breeze, but it being variable with fre|quent calms, we made little way. We kept turning out of the bay till the bay till the afternoon, and about ten o'clock we were &s;uddenly becalmed, &s;o that the &s;hip would neither wear nor &s;tay, and the tide of current &s;etting &s;trong, &s;he drove towards land &s;o fa&s;t, that before any mea&s;ures could be taken for her &s;ecurity, &s;he was within a cable's length of the break|ers:
<PB N="233" REF="013324_0260_0F8FFBC60828FD40">
we had thirteen fathom water, but the ground was &s;o foul that we did not dare to drop our anchor; the pinnace therefore was immediately hoi&s;ted out to take the &s;hip in tow, and the men, &s;en&s;ible of their danger, exerting them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, and a faint breeze &s;pringing up off the land, we perceived with un&s;peakable joy that &s;he made head way, after having been &s;o near the &s;hore that Tupia, who was not &s;en&s;ible of our hair's breadth e&s;cape, was at this very time conver&s;ing with the people upon the beach, who&s;e voices were di&s;tinctly heard, notwith&s;tanding the roar of the breakers. We now thought all danger was over, but about an hour afterwards, ju&s;t as the man in the chains had cried "&s;eventeen fathom," the &s;hip &s;truck. The &s;hock threw us all into the utmo&s;t con|&s;ternation; Mr. Banks, who had undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and was &s;tepping into bed, ran ha&s;tily up to the deck, and the man in the chains called out "five fathom;" by this time, the rock on which we had &s;truck being to windward, the &s;hip went off without having received the lea&s;t damage, and the water very &s;oon deepened to twenty fathom.</P>
<P>This rock lies half a mile W. N. W. of the northermo&s;t or outermo&s;t i&s;land on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of the bay. We had light airs from the land, whith calms, till nine o'clock the next morning, when we got out of the bay, and a breeze &s;pringing up at N. N. W. we &s;tood out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>This bay, as I have before ob&s;erved, lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of Cape Bret, and I named it the BAY OF ISLANDS, from the great number of i&s;lands which line its &s;hores, and form &s;everal harbours equally &s;afe and commodious, where there is room and depth for any number of &s;hipping. That in which we lay is on the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;outh we&s;termo&s;t i&s;land, called MATUARO, on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of the bay. I have made no accurate &s;urvey of this bay, being di&s;couraged by the time it would co&s;t me; I thought al&s;o that it was &s;ufficient to be able to affirm that it afforded us good anchorage, and re|fre&s;hment of every kind. It was not the &s;ea&s;on for roots, but we had plenty of fi&s;h, mo&s;t of which, however, we purcha&s;ed of the natives, for we could catch very little our&s;elves either with net or line. When we &s;hewed the natives our &s;eine, which is &s;uch as the King's &s;hips are generally furni&s;hed with, they laughed at it, and in triumph produced their own, which was indeed of an enormous &s;ize, and made of a kind of gra&s;s, which is very &s;trong: is was five fathom deep, and by the room it took up, it could not be le&s;s than three or four hund|red fathom long. Fi&s;hing indeed &s;eems to be the chief bu&s;i|ne&s;s of life in this part of the country; we &s;aw about all their towns a great number of nets, laid in heaps like hay-cocks, and covered with a thatch to keep them from the weather, and we &s;carcely entered a hou&s;e where &s;ome of the people were not
<PB N="234" REF="013324_0261_0F8FFBC6CA33EC58">
employed in making them. The fi&s;h we procured here were &s;harks, &s;ting-rays, &s;ea-bream, mullet, mackrel, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>The inhabitants in this bay are far more numerous than in any other part of the country that we had before vi&s;ited; it did not appear to us that they were united under one head, and though their towns were fortified, they &s;eemed to live together in perfect amity.</P>
<P>It is high water in this bay at the full and change of the moon, about eight o'clock, and the tide then ri&s;es from &s;ix to eight feet perpendicularly. It appears, from &s;uch ob&s;er|vations as I was able to make of the tides upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t, that the flood comes from the &s;outhward; and I have rea&s;on to think that there is a current which comes from the we&s;t|ward, and &s;ets along the &s;hore to the S. E. or S. S. E. as the land happens to lie.</P>

<P>ON Thur&s;day the 7th of December, at noon, Cape Bret bore S. S. E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant ten miles, and our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 34&deg; 59&prime; S.; &s;oon after we made &s;everal ob&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, the re&s;ult of which made our longitude 185&deg; 36&prime; W. The wind being again&s;t us, we had made but little way. In the afternoon, we &s;tood in &s;hore, and fetched clo&s;e under the Cavalles, from which i&s;lands the main trends W. by N.: &s;everal canoes put off and followed us, but a light breeze &s;pringing up, I did not chu&s;e to wait for them. I kept &s;tanding to the W. N. W. and N. W. till the next morning ten o'clock, when I tacked and &s;tood in for the &s;hore, from which we were about five leagues di&s;tant. At noon the we&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight bore W. by S. and was about four leagues di&s;tant. In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze to the we&s;t, which in the evening came to the &s;outh, and continuing &s;o all night, by day-light brought us pretty well in with the land, &s;even leagues to the we&s;tward of the Cavalles, where we found a deep bay running in S. W. by W. and W. S. W. the bottom of which we could but ju&s;t &s;ee, and there the land appeared to be low and level. To this bay, which I called DOUBTLESS BAY, the entrance is formed by two points, which lie W. N. W. and E. S. E. and are five miles di&s;tant from each other. The wind not permitting us to look in here, we &s;teered for the we&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight, which bore from us W. N. W. about three leagues, but before we got the length of it it fell calm.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="013324_0262_0F8FFBC7EBC663F0">
While we lay becalmed, &s;everal canoes came off to us, but the people having heard of our guns, it was not without great difficulty that they were per&s;uaded to come under our &s;tern: after having bought &s;ome of their cloaths, as well as their fi&s;h, we began to make enquiries concerning their country, and learnt, by the help of Tupia, that, at the di&s;tance of three days rowing in their canoes, at a place called MOORE-WHENNUA, the land would take a &s;hort turn to the &s;outh|ward, and from thence extend no more to the we&s;t. This place we concluded to be the land di&s;covered by Ta&s;man, which he called CAPE MARIA VAN DIEMEN, and finding the&s;e people &s;o intelligent, we inquired farther, if they knew of any country be&s;ides their own: they an&s;wered, that they had never vi&s;ited any other, but that their ance&s;tors had told them, that to the N. W. by N. or N. N. W. there was a country of great extent, called. ULIMAROA, to which &s;ome people had &s;ailed in a very large canoe; that only part of them returned, and reported, that after a pa&s;&s;age of a month they had &s;een a country where the people eat hogs. Tupia then enquired whether the&s;e adventurers brought any hogs with them when they returned; they &s;aid no: then, replied Tupia, your &s;to|ry is certainly fal&s;e, for it cannot be believed that men who came back from an expedition without hogs, had ever vi&s;ited a country where hogs were to be procured. It is however re|markable, notwith&s;tanding the &s;hrewdne&s;s of Tupia's objec|tion, that when they mentioned hogs it was not by de&s;cription but by name, calling them <HI>Booah,</HI> the name which is given them in the South-&s;ea i&s;lands; but if the animal had been wholly unknown to them, and they had had no communica|tion with the people to whom it was known, they could not po&s;&s;ibly have been acquainted with the name.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock at night, a breeze &s;prung up at W. N. W. with which we &s;tood off north; and at noon the next day, the Cavalles bore S. E. by E. di&s;tant eight leagues; the entrance of Doubtle&s;s Bay S. by W. di&s;tant three leagues; and the north we&s;t extremity of the land in &s;ight, which we judged to be the main, bore N. W. by W.: our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 34&deg; 44&prime; S. In the evening, we found the variation to be 12&deg; 41&prime; E. by the azimuth, and 12&deg; 40&prime; by the amplitude.</P>
<P>Early in the morning, we &s;tood in with the land, &s;even leagues to the we&s;tward of Doubtle&s;s Bay, the bottom of which is not far di&s;tant from the bottom of another large bay, which the &s;hore forms at this place, being &s;eparated only by a low neck of land, which juts out into a penin&s;ula that I have called KNUCKLE POINT. About the middle of this bay, which we called SANDY BAY, it is a high mountain, &s;tanding upon a di&s;tant &s;hore, to which I gave the name of MOUNT CAMEL. The latitude here is 34&deg; 51&prime; S. and longitude 186&deg;
<PB N="236" REF="013324_0263_0F8FFBC8533E6C10">
50&prime;. We had twenty-four and twenty-five fathom water, with a good bottom; but there &s;eems to be nothing in this bay that can induce a &s;hip to put into it; for the land about it is utterly barren and de&s;olate, and, except Mount Camel, the &s;ituation is low: the &s;oil appears to be nothing but white &s;and, thrown up in low irregular hills and narrow ridges, lying parallel with the &s;hore. But barren and de&s;olate as this place is, it is not without inhabitants: we &s;aw one village on the we&s;t &s;ide of Mount Camel, and another on the ea&s;t &s;ide; we &s;aw al&s;o five canoes full of people, who pulled after the &s;hip, but could not come up with us. At nine o'clock, we tacked and &s;tood to the northward; and at noon the Cavalles bore S. E. by E. di&s;tant thirteen leagues; the north extre|mity of the land in &s;ight, making like an i&s;land, bore N. W. &frac14; N. di&s;tant nine leagues; and Mount Camel bore S. W. by S. di&s;tance &s;ix leagues.</P>
<P>The wind being contrary, we kept plying northward till five o'clock in the evening of the 12th, when, having made very little way, we tacked and &s;tood to the N. E. being two leagues to the northward of Mount Camel, and about a mile and an half from the &s;hore, in which &s;ituation we had two and twenty fathom water.</P>
<P>At ten it began to blow and rain, which brought us under double reefed top&s;ails; at twelve, we tacked and &s;tood to the we&s;tward till &s;even the next morning, when we tacked and &s;tood again to the N. E. being about a mile to windward of the place where we tacked la&s;t night. Soon after it blew ve|ry had at N. N. W. with heavy &s;qualls and much rain, which brought us under our cour&s;es, and &s;plit the main top&s;ail; &s;o that we were obliged to unbend it and bend another: at ten it became more moderate, and we &s;et the top&s;ails, double reefed: at noon, having &s;trong gales and heavy weather, we tacked and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, and had no land in &s;ight for the fir&s;t time &s;ince we had been upon this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>We had now &s;trong gales at W. and W. S. W.; and at half an hour pa&s;t three we tacked and &s;tood to the northward. Soon after, a &s;mall i&s;land lying off Knuckle Point bore S. &frac12; W. di&s;tant half a league. In the evening, having &s;plit the &s;ore and mizen top&s;ails, we brought the &s;hip under her cour&s;es; and at midnight, we wore, and &s;tood to the &s;outhward till five in the morning; when we tacked and &s;tood to the N. W. and &s;aw land bearing &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of eight or nine leagues; by this we di&s;covered that we had fallen much to the leeward &s;ince ye&s;terday morning. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 34&deg; 6&prime;.; and the &s;ame land which we had &s;een before to the N. W. now bore S. W. and appeared to be the northern extremity of the country. We had a large &s;well rolling in from the we&s;tward, and therefore concluded
<PB N="237" REF="013324_0264_0F8FFBC90982E408">
that we were not covered by any land in that quarter. At eight in the evening, we tacked and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, with as much &s;ail as we could bear; and at noon the next day, we were in latitude 34&deg; 10&prime;, longitude 185&deg; 45&prime; W. and by e&s;timation about &s;eventeen leagues from the land, notwith|&s;tanding our utmo&s;t endeavours to keep in with it.</P>
<P>On the 16th, at &s;ix in the morning, we &s;aw land from the ma&s;t-head, bearing S. S. W.; and at noon it bore S. by W. di&s;tant fourteen leagues: while we were &s;tanding in for the &s;hore we &s;ounded &s;everal times, but had no ground with ninety fathom, at eight we tacked in a hundred and eight fa|thom, at about three or four miles from the &s;hore, which was the &s;ame point of land that we had to the N. W. before we were blown off. At noon it bore S. W. di&s;tant about three miles; Mount Camel bore S. by E. di&s;tant about eleven leagues, and the we&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight bore S. 75 W.; the latitude by ob&s;ervation was 34&deg; 20&prime; S. At four o'clock we tacked and &s;tood in &s;hore, in doing which, we met with a &s;trong rippling, and the &s;hip fell fa&s;t to leeward, which we imputed to a current &s;etting ea&s;t. At eight, we tacked and &s;tood off till eight the next morning; when we tacked and &s;tood in, being about ten leagues from the land: at noon, the point of land which we were near the day before, bore S. S. W. di&s;tant five leagues. The wind &s;till continued at we&s;t; and at &s;even o'clock, we tacked in thirty-five fathom, when the point of land which has been mentioned before, bore N. W. by N. di&s;tant four or five miles; &s;o that we had not gained one inch to windward the la&s;t twenty-four hours, which con|firmed our opinion that there was a current to the ea&s;tward. The point of land I called NORTH CAPE, it being the north|ern extremity of this country. It lies in latitude 34&deg; 22&prime; S. longitude 186&deg; 55&prime; W. and thirty-one leagues di&s;tant from Cape Bret, in the direction of N. 63 W. It forms the north point of Sandy Bay, and is a penin&s;ula jutting out N. E. about two miles, and terminating in a bluff head that is flat at the top. The i&s;thmus which joins this head to the main land is very low, and for that rea&s;on the land of the cape, from &s;eve|ral &s;ituations, has the appearance of an i&s;land. It is &s;till more remarkable when it is &s;een from the &s;outhward, by the ap|pearance of a high round i&s;land at the S. E. point of the cape; but this al&s;o is a deception; for what appears to be an i&s;land is a round hill, joined to the cape, by a low narrow neck of land. Upon the cape we &s;aw a hippah, or village, and a few inhabitants; and on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of it there appears to be anchorage, and good &s;helter from the &s;outh we&s;t and north we&s;t winds.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand off and on, making N. W, till noon on the 21&s;t, when North Cape bore S. 39 E. di&s;tant thirty-eight leagues. Our &s;ituation varied only a few leagues till the
<PB N="238" REF="013324_0265_0F8FFBC9D908E7B0">
23d, when, about &s;even o'clock in the evening, we &s;aw land from the ma&s;t-head, bearing S. &frac12; E. At eleven the next morning, we &s;aw it again, bearing S. S. E. at the di&s;tance of eight leagues: we now &s;tood to the S. W.; and at four o'clock, the land bore S. E. by S. di&s;tant four leagues, and proved to be a &s;mall i&s;land, with other i&s;lands or rocks, &s;till &s;maller, lying off the &s;outh we&s;t end of it, and another lying off the north ea&s;t end, which were di&s;covered by Ta&s;man and called the Three Kings. The principal i&s;land lies in latitude 34&deg; 12&prime; S. longitude, 187&deg; 48&prime; W. and di&s;tant fourteen or fifteen leagues from North Cape, in the direction of W. 14 N. At midnight we tacked and &s;tood to the N. E. till &s;ix the next morning, which was Chri&s;tmas day, when we tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outhward. At noon, the Three Kings bore E. 8 N. di&s;tant five or &s;ix leagues. The variation this morning by the azimuth was 11&deg; 25&prime; E.</P>
<P>On the 26th we &s;tood to the &s;outhward clo&s;e upon a wind; and at noon were in latitude 35&deg; 10&prime; S. longitude 188&deg; 20&prime; W. the Three Kings bearing N. 26 W. di&s;tant twenty-two leagues. In this &s;ituation we had no land in &s;ight; and yet, by ob&s;ervation we were in the latitude of the Bay of I&s;lands; and by my reckoning but twenty leagues to the we&s;tward of North Cape: from whence it appears, that the northern part of this i&s;land is very narrow; for otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t have &s;een &s;ome part of the we&s;t &s;ide of it. We &s;tood to the &s;outhward till twelve at night, and then tacked and &s;tood to the northward.</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the morning, the wind fre&s;hened, and at nine blew a &s;torm; &s;o that we were obliged to bring the &s;hip to under her main&s;ail. Our cour&s;e made good between noon this day and ye&s;terday was S. S. W. &frac12; W. di&s;tance eleven miles. The Three Kings bore N. 27 E. di&s;tant &s;eventy-&s;even miles. The gale continued all this day, and till two the next morn|ing, when it fell, and began to veer to the &s;outhward and S. W. where it fixed about four, when we made &s;ail and &s;teered ea&s;t in for the land, under the fore-&s;ail and main-&s;ail; but the wind then ri&s;ing, and by eight o'clock being increa&s;ed to a hurricane, with a prodigious &s;ea, we were obliged to take in the main-&s;ail; we then wore the &s;hip, and brought her to with her head to the north we&s;t. At noon the gale was &s;ome|what abated, but we had &s;till heavy &s;qualls. Our cour&s;e made good this day, was north, a little ea&s;terly, twenty-nine miles; latitude by account 34&deg; 50&prime; S. longitude 188&deg; 27&prime; W. the Three Kings bore N. 41 E. di&s;tant 52 miles. At &s;even o'clock in the evening, the Wind being at S. W. and S. W. by W. with hard &s;qualls, we wore and lay on the other tack; and at &s;ix the next morning &s;pread more &s;ail. Our cour&s;e and di&s;tance &s;ince ye&s;terday was E. by N. twenty-nine miles. In the afternoon we had hard &s;qualls at S. W.; and at eight in
<PB N="239" REF="013324_0266_0F8FFBCC17285458">
the evening, wore and &s;tood to the N. W. till five the next morning; and then wore and &s;tood to the S. E. At &s;ix, we &s;aw the land bearing N. E. di&s;tant about &s;ix leagues, which we judged to be Cape <HI>Maria Van Diemen,</HI> and which corre&s;|ponded with the account that had been given of it by the In|dians. At midnight we wore and &s;tood to the S. E. And on the next day at noon, Cape Maria Van Diemen bore N. E. by N. di&s;tant about five leagues. At &s;even in the evening, we tacked and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, with a moderate breeze at S. W. by S. and S. W. Mount Camel then bore N. 83 E. and the northermo&s;t land, or Cape Maria Van Diemen, N. by W.; we were now di&s;tant from the neare&s;t land about three leagues, where we had &s;omething more than forty fa|thom water; and it mu&s;t be remarked, that Mount Camel, which, when &s;een on the other &s;ide, did not &s;eem to be more than one mile from the &s;ea, &s;eemed to be but little more when &s;een from this &s;ide; which is a demon&s;tration that the land here cannot be more than two or three miles broad, or from &s;ea to &s;ea.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning of January the 1&s;t, 1770, being New-year's day, we tacked and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward, the Three Kings bearing N. W. by N. At noon we tacked again, and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, being in latitude 34&deg; 37&prime; S. the Three Kings bearing N. W. by N. at the di&s;tance of ten or eleven leagues; and Cape Maria Van Diemen N. 31 E. di&s;|tant about four leagues and an half: in this &s;ituation we had fifty-four fathom water.</P>
<P>During this part of our navigation two particulars are very remarkable; in latitude 35 S. and in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, I met with a gale of wind, which for its &s;trength and continu|ance was &s;uch as I had &s;carcely ever been in before, and we were three weeks in getting ten leagues to the we&s;tward, and five weeks in getting fifty leagues, for at this time it was &s;o long &s;ince we pa&s;&s;ed Cape Bret. During the gale, we were happily at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the land, otherwi&s;e it is highly probable that we &s;hould never have returned to re|late our adventures.</P>
<P>At five o'clock in the evening, having a fre&s;h breeze to the we&s;tward, we tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outhward: at this time North Cape bore E. &frac34; N. and ju&s;t open of a point that lies three leagues W. by N. from it.</P>
<P>This Cape, as I have ob&s;erved before, is the northermo&s;t extremity of this country, and the ea&s;termo&s;t point of a penin|&s;ula, which runs out N. W. and N. W. by N. &s;eventeen or eighteen leagues, and of which Cape Maria Van Diemen is the we&s;termo&s;t point. Cape Maria lies in latitude 34&deg; 30&prime; S. longitude 187&deg; 18&prime; W.; and from this point the land trends away S. E. by S. and S. E. beyond Mount Camel, and is
<PB N="240" REF="013324_0267_0F8FFBCD39CA47F0">
every where a barren &s;hore, con&s;i&s;ting of banks of white &s;and.</P>
<P>On the 2d at noon we were in latitude 35&deg; 17&prime; S. and Cape Maria bore north, di&s;tant about &s;ixteen leagues, as near as we could gue&s;s; for we had no land in &s;ight, and did not dare to go nearer, as a fre&s;h gale blew right on &s;hore, with a rolling &s;ea. The wind continued at W. S. W. and S. W. with frequent &s;qualls; in the evening we &s;hortened &s;ail, and at midnight tacked, and made a trip to the N. W. till two in the morning, when we wore and &s;tood to the &s;outhward. At break of day we made &s;ail, and edged away, in order to make land; and at ten o'clock we &s;aw it, bearing N. W. It ap|peared to be high, and at noon extended from N. to E. N. E. di&s;tant by e&s;timation eight or ten leagues. Cape Maria then bore N. 2&deg; 30&prime; W. di&s;tant thirty-three leagues; our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 36&deg; 2&prime; S. About &s;even o'clock in the evening, we were within &s;ix leagues of it; but having a fre&s;h gale upon it, with a rolling &s;ea, we hauled our wind to the S. E. and kept on that cour&s;e clo&s;e upon the wind all night, &s;ound|ing &s;everal times, but having no ground with one hundred, and one hundred and ten fathom.</P>
<P>At eight o'clock the next morning, we were about five leagues from the land, and off a place which lies in latitude 36&deg; 25&prime; and had the appearance of a bay or inlet. It bore ea&s;t; and in order to &s;ee more of it, we kept on our cour&s;e till eleven o'clock, when we were not more than three leagues from it, and then di&s;covered that it was neither inlet nor bay, but a tract of low land, bounded by higher lands on each &s;ide, which produced the deception. At this time we tacked and &s;tood to the N. W.; and at noon the land was not di&s;tant more than three or four leagues. We were now in latitude 36&deg; 31&prime; S. lon|gitude 185&deg; 50&prime; W. Cape Maria bore N. 25 W. di&s;tant for|ty-four leagues and an half; &s;o that the coa&s;t mu&s;t be almo&s;t &s;trait, in the direction of S. S. E. &frac34; E. and N. N. W. &frac34; W. nearly. In about latitude 35&deg; 45&prime; is &s;ome high land adjoin|ing to the &s;ea; to the &s;outhward of which the &s;hore is al&s;o high, and has the mo&s;t de&s;olate and inho&s;pitable appearance that can be imagined. Nothing is to be &s;een but hills of &s;and, on which there is &s;carcely a blade of verdure; and a va&s;t &s;ea impelled by the we&s;terly winds, breaking upon it in a dread|ful &s;urf, renders it not only forlorn, but frightful: complicat|ing the idea of danger with de&s;olation, and impre&s;&s;ing the mind at once with a &s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery and death. From this place I &s;teered to the northward, re&s;olving never more to come within the &s;ame di&s;tance of the coa&s;t, except the wind &s;hould be very favourable indeed. I &s;tood under a fre&s;h &s;ail all the day, hoping to get an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing by the next noon, and we made good a cour&s;e of a hundred and two miles N. 38 W.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="013324_0268_0F8FFBCE2F315C20">
Our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 35&deg; 10&prime; S.; and Cape Ma|ria bore N. 10 E. di&s;tance forty-one miles. In the night the wind &s;hifted from S. W. by S. to S. and blew fre&s;h. Our cour&s;e to the noon of the 5th was N. 75 W. di&s;tance eight miles.</P>
<P>At day-break on the 6th, we &s;aw the land which we took to be Cape Maria, bearing N. N. E. di&s;tant eight or nine leagues: and on the 7th, in the afternoon, the land bore ea&s;t: and &s;ome time after, we di&s;covered a turtle upon the water; but being awake, it dived in&s;tantly, &s;o that we could not take it. At noon, the high land, which has ju&s;t been mentioned, extended from N. to E. at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix leagues; and in two places a flat gave it the appearance of a bay or inlet. The cour&s;e that we made good the la&s;t four and twenty hours was S. 33 E. fifty-three miles; Cape Ma|ria bearing N. 25 W. di&s;tant thirty leagues.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed within &s;ight of land all this day, with gentle gales between the N. E. and N. W.; and by the next noon had &s;ailed &s;ixty-nine miles, in the direction of S. 37 E.; our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 36&deg; 39&prime; S. The land which on the fourth we had taken for a bay, now bore N. E. by N. di&s;tant five leagues and an half; and Cape Maria N. 29 W. forty-&s;even leagues.</P>
<P>On the 9th, we continued a &s;outh ea&s;t cour&s;e till eight o'clock in the evening, having run &s;even leagues &s;ince noon, with the wind at N. N. E. and N. and being within three or four leagues of the land, which appeared to be low and &s;andy. I then &s;teered S. E. by S. in a direction parallel with the coa&s;t, having from forty-eight to thirty-four fathom water, with a black &s;andy bottom. At day-break the next morning, we found our&s;elves between two and three leagues from the land, which began to have a better appearance, ri&s;ing in gentle &s;lopes, and being covered with trees and herbage, We &s;aw a &s;moke and a few hou&s;es, but it appeared to be but thinly in|habited. At &s;even o'clock, we &s;teered S. by E. and after|wards S. by W. the land lying in that direction. At nine we were abrea&s;t of a point which ri&s;es with an ea&s;y a&s;cent from the &s;ea to a con&s;iderable height: this point, which lies in la|titude 37&deg; 43&prime;, I named WOODY HEAD. About eleven miles from this head, in the direction of S. W. &frac12; W. lies a very &s;mall i&s;land, upon which we &s;aw a great number of gannets, and which we therefore called GANNET ISLAND. At noon, a high craggy point bore E. N. E. di&s;tant about a league and a half, to which I gave the name of ALBETROSS POINT: it lies in latitude 38&deg; 4&prime; S. longitude 184&deg; 42&prime; W.; and is di&s;|tant &s;even leagues in the direction of S. 17 W. from Woody Head. On the north &s;ide of this point the &s;hore forms a bay, in which there apears to be anchorage and &s;helter for &s;hip|ping
<PB N="242" REF="013324_0269_0F8FFBCE4C11EB88">
Our cour&s;e and di&s;tance for the la&s;t twenty-four hours was S. 37 E. &s;ixty-nine miles; and at noon this day Cape Maria bore N. 30 W. di&s;tant eighty-two leagues. Between twelve and one, the wind &s;hifted at once from N. N. E. to S. S. W. with which we &s;tood to the we&s;tward till four o'clock in the afternoon: and then tacked, and &s;tood again in &s;hore till &s;e|ven; when we tacked again and &s;tood to the we&s;tward till four o'clock in the afternoon; and then tacked, and &s;tood again in &s;hore till &s;even; when we tacked again and &s;tood to the we&s;t|ward, having but little wind. At this time, Albetro&s;s Point bore N. E. di&s;tant near two leagues, and the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore S. S. W. &frac12; W. being a very high mountain, and in appearance greatly re&s;embling the Pike of Teneriffe. In this &s;ituation we had thirty fathom water, and having but little wind all night, we tacked about four in the morning, and &s;tood in for the &s;hore. Soon after it fell calm; and being in forty-two fathom water, the people caught a few &s;ea-bream. At eleven a light breeze &s;prung up from the we&s;t, and we made &s;ail to the &s;outhward. We continued to &s;teer S. by W. and S. S. W. along the &s;hore, at the di&s;tance of about four leagues with gentle breezes from between N. W. and N. N. E. At &s;even in the evening we &s;aw the top of the peak to the &s;outh|ward, above the clouds which concealed it below. And at this time, the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore S. by W. the va|riation, by &s;everal azimuths which were taken both in the morning and the evening, appeared to be 14&deg; 15&prime; ea&s;terly.</P>
<P>At noon on the 12th, we were di&s;tant about three leagues from the &s;hore which lies under the peak, but the peak it&s;elf was wholly concealed by clouds: we judged it to bear about S. S. E.; and &s;ome very remarkable peaked i&s;lands, which lay under the &s;hore, bore E. S. E. di&s;tant three or four leagues. At &s;even in the evening we founded, and had forty-two fa|thom, being di&s;tant from the &s;hore between two and three leagues: we judged the peak to bear ea&s;t; and after it was dark, we &s;aw fires upon the &s;hore.</P>
<P>At five o'clock in the morning we &s;aw, for a few minutes, the &s;ummit of the peak, towering above the clouds, and cover|ed with &s;now. It now bore N. E.; it lies in latitude 39&deg; 16&prime; S. longitude 185&deg; 15&prime; W.; and I named it MOUNT EG|MONT, in honour of the Earl. It &s;eems to have a large ba&s;e, and to ri&s;e with a gradual a&s;cent; it lies near the &s;ea, and is &s;urrounded by a flat country, of a plea&s;ant appearance, being clothed with verdure and wood, which renders it the more con|&s;picuous, and the &s;hore under it forms a large cape, which I named CAPE EGMONT. It lies S. S. W. &frac12; W. twenty-&s;even leagues di&s;tant from Albetro&s;s Point, and on the north &s;ide of it are two &s;mall i&s;lands, which lie near a remarkable point on the main, that ri&s;es to a con&s;iderable height in the form of
<PB N="243" REF="013324_0270_0F8FFBCF0F0E9188">
a &s;ugar loaf. To the &s;outhward of the Cape, the land trends away S. E. by E. and S. S. E. and &s;eems to be every where a bold &s;hore. At noon Cape Egmont bore about N. E. and in this direction, at about four leagues from the &s;hore, we had forty fathom of water. The wind during the re&s;t of the day was from W. to N. W. by W. and we continued to &s;teer along the &s;hore S. S. E. and S. E. by E. keeping at the di&s;tance of between two and three leagues. At half an hour after &s;even, we had another tran&s;ient view of Mount Edgcombe, which bore N. 17 W. di&s;tant about ten leagues.</P>
<P>At five the next morning we &s;teered S. E. by S. the coa&s;t inclining more &s;outherly; and in about half an hour, we &s;aw land bearing S. W. by S. for which we hauled up. At noon the north we&s;t extremity of the land in &s;ight bore S. 63 W. and &s;ome high land, which had the appearance of an i&s;land lying under the main, bore S. S. E. di&s;tant five leagues. We were now in a bay, the bottom of which bearing &s;outh we could not &s;ee, though it was clear in that quarter. Our la|titude by ob&s;ervation was 40&deg; 27&prime; S. longitude 184&deg; 39&prime; W. At eight in the evening, we were within two leagues of the land which we had di&s;covered in the morning, having run ten leagues &s;ince noon: the land which then bore S. 63 W. now bore N. 59 W. at the di&s;tance of &s;even or eight leagues, and had the appearance of an i&s;land. Between this land and Cape Egmont lies the bay, the we&s;t &s;ide of which was our &s;ituation at this time, and the land here is of a con&s;iderable height, and diver&s;ified by hill and valley.</P>

there being little wind, and what there was being variable, we were carried by the tide or current within two cable's length of the north we&s;t &s;hore, where we had fifty-four fathom water, but by the help of our boats we got clear. Ju&s;t at this time we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> ri&s;e twice near the &s;hore, the head of which exactly re&s;embled that of the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e which has been de|&s;cribed in the account of Lord An&s;on's Voyage. We &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome of the natives in a canoe cro&s;s the bay, and a village &s;i|tuated upon the point of an i&s;land which lies &s;even or eight miles within the entrance. At noon, we were the length of this i&s;land, but there being little wind, the boats were or|dered ahead to row. About one o'clock, we hauled clo&s;e round the &s;outh we&s;t end of the i&s;land; and the inhabitants of the village, which was built upon it, were immediately up in arms. About two we anchored in a very &s;afe and convenient cove, on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the bay, and facing the &s;outh we&s;t end of the i&s;land, in eleven fathom water, with &s;oft ground, and moored with the &s;tream anchor.</P>
<P>We were about four long cannon &s;hot di&s;tant from the vil|lage or Heppah, from which four canoes were immediately di&s;patched, as we imagined to reconnoitre, and if they &s;hould find them&s;elves able, to take us. The men were all well armed, and dre&s;&s;ed nearly as they are repre&s;ented in the figure pub|li&s;hed by Ta&s;man; two corners of the cloth which they wrap|ped round the body were pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;houlders from be|hind, and being brought down to to the upper edge of it be|fore, were made fa&s;t to it ju&s;t under the brea&s;t; but few, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">one, had feathers in their hair. They rowed round the &s;hip &s;everal times, with their u&s;ual tokens of menace and defiance, and at la&s;t began the a&s;&s;ault by throwing &s;ome &s;tones: Tupia expo&s;tulated with them, but apparently of very little pur|po&s;e; and we began to fear that they would oblige us to fire at them, when a very old man in one of the boats expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of coming on board. We gladly encouraged him in his de&s;ign, a rope was thrown into his canoe, and &s;he was immediately along &s;ide of the &s;hip: the old man ro&s;e up, and prepared to come up the &s;hip's &s;ide, upon which all the re&s;t expo&s;tulated with great vehemence again&s;t the attempt, and at la&s;t laid hold of him, and held him back; he adhered how|ever to his purpo&s;e with a calm but &s;teady per&s;everance, and having at length di&s;engaged him&s;elf, he came on board. We received him with all po&s;&s;ible expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s, and after &s;ome time di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, with many pre|&s;ents to his companions. As &s;oon as he was returned on board his canoe, the people in all the re&s;t began to dance, but whe|ther as a token of enmity or friend&s;hip we could not certainly determine, for we had &s;een them dance in a di&s;po&s;ition both for peace and war. In a &s;hort time, however, they retired to
<PB N="245" REF="013324_0272_0F8FFBD087084B00">
their fort, and &s;oon after I went on &s;hore, with mo&s;t of the gentlemen, at the bottom of the cove, a-brea&s;t of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>We found a fine &s;tream of excellent water, and wood in the greate&s;t plenty, for the land here was one fore&s;t of va&s;t ex|tent. As we brought the &s;eine with us, we hauled it once or twice, and with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s that we caught near three hundred weight of fi&s;h of different &s;orts, which was equally di&s;tributed among the &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>At day-break, while we were bu&s;y in careening the &s;hip, three canoes came off to us, having on board above a hundred men, be&s;ides everal of their women, which we were plea&s;ed to &s;ee, as it general it is a &s;ign of peace; but they &s;oon after|wards became very trouble&s;ome, and gave us rea&s;on to ap|prehend &s;ome mi&s;chief from them to the people that were in our boats along&s;ide the &s;hip. While we were in this &s;ituation, the long-boat was &s;ent a&s;hore with &s;ome water ca&s;ks, and &s;ome of the canoes attempting to follow her, we found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to intimidate them by firing &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot: we were at &s;uch a di&s;tance that it was impo&s;&s;ible to hurt them, yet our reproof had its effect, and they de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit. They had &s;ome fi&s;h in their canoes, which they now offered to &s;ell, and which, though it &s;tunk, we con&s;ented to buy: for this purpo&s;e a man in a &s;mall boat was &s;ent among them, and they traded for &s;ome time very fairly. At length, how|ever, one of them watching his opportunity, &s;natched at &s;ome paper which our market-man held in his hand, and mi&s;&s;ing it immediately put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence, flouri&s;hing his patoo-patoo, and making &s;hew as if he was about to &s;trike; &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot then were fired at him from the &s;hip, a few of which &s;truck him upon the knee: this put an end to our trade, but the Indians &s;till continued near the &s;hip, rowing round her many times, and conver&s;ing with Tupia, chiefly concerning the traditions they had among them, with re&s;pect to the anti|quities of their country. To this &s;ubject they were led by the enquiries which Tupia had been directed to make, whether they had ever &s;een &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el as ours, or had ever heard that any &s;uch had been upon their coa&s;t. The&s;e enquiries were all an&s;wered in the negative, &s;o that tradition has pre&s;erved among them no memorial of Ta&s;man; though, by an ob&s;er|vation made this day, we find that we are only fifteen miles &s;outh of Murderer's Bay, our latitude being 41&deg; 5&prime; 32", and Murderer's bay, according to his account, being 40&deg; 50&prime;.</P>
<P>The wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n in the&s;e canoes, and &s;ome of the men, had a head-dre&s;s which we had not before &s;een. It con&s;i&s;ted of a bunch of black feathers, made up in a round form, and tied upon the top of the head, which it intirely covered, and made it twice as high, to appearance, as it was in reality.</P>
<P>After dinner I went in the pinnace with Mr. Banks, Dr.
<PB N="246" REF="013324_0273_0F8FFBD2A7834F88">
Solander, Tupia, and &s;ome others, into another cove, about two miles di&s;tant from that in which the &s;hip lay: in our way we &s;aw &s;omething floating upon the water, which we took for a dead &s;eal, but upon rowing up to it, found it to be the body of a woman, which to all appearance had been dead &s;ome days. We proceeded to our cove, where we went on &s;hore, and found a &s;mall family of Indians, who appeared to be greatly terrified at our approach, and all ran away except one. A conver&s;ation between this per&s;on and Tupia &s;oon brought back the re&s;t, except an old man and a child, who &s;till kept aloof, but &s;tood peeping at us from the woods. Of the&s;e people our curio&s;ity naturally led us to enquire after the body of the woman which we had &s;een floating upon the wa|ter: and they acquainted us, by Tupia, that &s;he was a rela|tion, who had died a natural death; and that, according to their cu&s;tom, they had tied a &s;tone to the body, and thrown it into the &s;ea, which &s;tone, they &s;uppo&s;ed, had by &s;ome ac|cident been di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>This family, when we came a&s;hore, was employed in dre&s;|&s;ing &s;ome provi&s;ions: the body of a dog was at this time bu|ried in their oven, and many provi&s;ion ba&s;kets &s;tood near it. Having ca&s;t our eyes carele&s;sly into one of the&s;e, as we pa&s;|&s;ed it, we &s;aw two bones pretty cleanly picked, which did not &s;eem to be the bones of a dog, and which, upon a nearer exa|mination, we di&s;covered to be tho&s;e of a human body. At this &s;ight we were &s;truck with horror, though it was only a confirmation of what we had heard many times &s;ince we ar|rived upon this coa&s;t. As we could have no doubt but the bones were human, neither could we have any doubt but that the fle&s;h which covered them had been eaten. They were found in a provi&s;ion ba&s;ket; the fle&s;h that remained appeared manife&s;tly to have been dre&s;&s;ed by fire, and in the gri&s;tles at the end, were the marks of the teeth which had gnawed them; to put an end however to conjecture, founded upon circum|&s;tances and appearances, we directed Tupia to a&s;k what bones they were; and the Indians, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, an|&s;wered, the bones of a man: they were then a&s;ked what was become of the fle&s;h, and they replied that they had eaten it; but, &s;aid Tupia, why did you not eat the body of the woman which we &s;aw floating upon the water: the woman, &s;aid they, died of di&s;ea&s;e; be&s;ides, &s;he was our relation, and we eat only the bodies of our enemies, who are killed in battle. Upon enquiry who the man was who&s;e bones we had found, they told us, that about five days before, a boat belonging to their enemies came into the bay, with many per&s;ons on board, and that this man was one of &s;even whom they had killed. Though &s;tronger evidence of this horrid practice pre|vailing among the inhabitants of this coa&s;t will &s;carcely be re|quired,
<PB N="247" REF="013324_0274_0F8FFBD3CCADBE28">
we have &s;till &s;tronger to give. One of us a&s;ked if they had any human bones with the fle&s;h remaining upon them, and upon their an&s;wering us that all had been eaten, we af|fected to di&s;believe that the bones were human, and &s;aid that they were the bones of a dog; upon which one of the Indians with &s;ome eagerne&s;s took hold of his own fore-arm, and thru&s;ting it towards us, &s;aid, that the bone which Mr. Banks held in his hand had belonged to that part of a human body; at the &s;ame time, to convince us that the fle&s;h had been eaten, he took hold of his own arm with his teeth, and made &s;hew of eating: he al&s;o bit and gnawed the bone which Mr. Banks had taken, drawing it through his mouth, and &s;hewing, by &s;igns, that it had afforded a delicious repa&s;t; the bone was then returned to Mr. Banks, and he brought it away with him. Among the per&s;ons of this family, there was a woman who had her arms, legs, and thighs frightfully cut in &s;everal places; and we were told that &s;he had inflicted the wounds upon her&s;elf, in token of her grief for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, who had been lately killed and eaten by their enemies, who had come from &s;ome place to the ea&s;tward, towards which the Indians pointed.</P>
<P>The &s;hip lay at the di&s;tance of &s;omewhat le&s;s than a quarter of a mile from the &s;hore, and in the morning we were awaken|ed by the &s;inging of the birds: the number was incredible, and they &s;eemed to &s;train their throats in emulation of each other. This wild melody was infinitely &s;uperior to any that we had ever heard of the &s;ame kind; it &s;eemed to be like &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ells, mo&s;t exqui&s;itely tuned, and perhaps the di&s;tance, and the water between, might be no &s;mall advantage to the &s;ound. Upon enquiry, we were informed that the birds here always began to &s;ing about two hours after midnight, and continuing their mu&s;ick till &s;un-ri&s;e, were, like our nightingales, &s;ilent the re&s;t of the day. In the forenoon, a &s;mall canoe came off from the Indian village to the &s;hip, and among tho&s;e that were in it, was the old man who had fir&s;t come on board at our arrival in the bay. As &s;oon as it came along&s;ide, Tupia renewed the conver&s;ation, that had pa&s;&s;ed the day before, con|cerning their practice of eating human fle&s;h, during which they repeated what they had told us already; but, &s;aid Tupia, where are the heads? do you eat them too? Of the heads, &s;aid the old man, we eat only the brains, and the next time I come I will bring you &s;ome of them to convince you that what we have told you is truth. After &s;ome farther conver|&s;ation between the&s;e people and Tupia, they told him that they expected their enemies to come very &s;hortly, to revenge the death of the &s;even men whom they had killed and eaten.</P>
<P>On the 18th the Indians were more quiet than u&s;ual, no canoe came near the &s;hip, nor did we &s;ee any of them moving
<PB N="248" REF="013324_0275_0F8FFBD4B503AF90">
on the &s;hore, their fi&s;hing, and other u&s;ual occupations being totally &s;u&s;pended. We thought they expected an attack on this day, and therefore attended more diligently to what pa&s;&s;ed on &s;hore; but we &s;aw nothing to gratify our curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, we went out in the pinnace, to take a view of the bay, which was of va&s;t extent, and con&s;i&s;ted of numberle&s;s &s;mall harbours and coves, in every direction: we confine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our excur&s;ion however to the we&s;tern &s;ide, and the country being an impenetrable fore&s;t where we landed, we could &s;ee nothing worthy of notice: we killed, however, a good number of &s;haggs, which we &s;aw &s;itting upon their ne&s;ts in the trees, and which, whether roa&s;ted or &s;tewed, we con&s;i|dered as very good provi&s;ion. As we were returning, we &s;aw a &s;ingle man in a canoe fi&s;hing; we rowed up to him, and to our great &s;urpri&s;e he took not the lea&s;t notice of us, but even when we were along&s;ide of him, continued to follow his oc|cupation, without adverting to us any more than if we had been invi&s;ible. He did not, however, appear to be either &s;ullen or &s;tupid: we reque&s;ted him to draw up his net, that we might examine it, and he readily complied: It was of a circular form, extended by two hoops, and about &s;even or eight-feet in diameter: the top was open, and &s;ea-ears were fa&s;tened to the bottom as a bait: this he let down &s;o as to lay upon the ground, and when he thought fi&s;h enough were a&s;|&s;embled over it, he drew it up by a very gentle and even mo|tion, &s;o that the fi&s;h ro&s;e with it, &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible that they were lifted, till they came very near the &s;urface of the water, and then were brought out in the net by a &s;udden jerk. By this &s;imple method he had caught abundance of fi&s;h, and in|deed they are &s;o plenty in this bay, that the catching them requires neither much labour nor art.</P>
<P>This day &s;ome of our people found in the &s;kirts of the wood, near a hole or oven, three human hip-bones, which they brought on board; a farther proof that the&s;e people eat human fle&s;h: Mr. Monkhou&s;e, our &s;urgeon, al&s;o brought on board, from a place where he &s;aw many de&s;erted hou&s;es, the hair of a man's head, which he had found, among many other things, tied up to the branches of trees.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 19th, we &s;et up the armourer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s forge to repair the braces of the tiller, and other iron-work, all hands on board being &s;till bu&s;y in careening, and other ne|ce&s;&s;ary operations about the ve&s;&s;el: this day &s;ome Indians came on board from another part of the bay, where they &s;aid there was a town which we had not &s;een: they brought plenty of fi&s;h, which they &s;old for nails, having now acquired &s;ome notion of their u&s;e; and in this traffic no unfair practice was attempted.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 20th, our old man kept his promi&s;e, and brought on board four of the heads of the &s;even people
<PB N="249" REF="013324_0276_0F8FFBD507E23FE0">
who had been &s;o much the &s;ubject of our enquiries: the hair and fle&s;h were entire, but we perceived that the brains had been extracted; the fle&s;h was &s;oft, but had by &s;ome method been pre&s;erved from putrefaction, for it had no di&s;agreeable &s;mell. Mr. Banks purcha&s;ed one of them, but they &s;old it with great reluctance, and could not by any means be pre|vailed upon to part with a &s;econd; probably they may be pre|&s;erved as trophies, like the &s;calps in America, and the jaw|bones in the i&s;lands of the South Seas. Upon examining the head which had been bought by Mr. Banks, we perceived that it had received a blow upon the temples, which had frac|tured the &s;kull. This day we made another excur&s;ion in the pinnace, to &s;urvey the bay, but we found no flat large enough for a potatoe garden, nor could we di&s;cover the lea&s;t appear|ance of cultivation: we met not a &s;ingle Indian, but found an excellent harbour; and about eight o'clock in the evening returned on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went a fi&s;hing with hook and line, and caught an immen&s;e quantity every where upon the rocks, in between four and five fathom water: the &s;eine was hauled every night, and &s;eldom failed to &s;upply the whole &s;hip's company with as much fi&s;h as they could eat. This day all the people had leave to go on &s;hore at the water|ing-place, and divert them&s;elves as they &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 22d, I &s;et out again in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with a de&s;ign to examine the head of the inlet, but after rowing about four or five leagues without &s;o much as coming in &s;ight of it, the wind being contrary, and the day half &s;pent, we went on &s;hore on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide, to try what might be di&s;covered from the hills.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander immediately employed them|&s;elves in botanizing near the beach, and I, taking a &s;eaman with me, a&s;cended one of the hills: when I reached the &s;um|mit, I found a view of the inlet intercepted by hills, which in that direction ro&s;e &s;till higher, and which were rendered inacce&s;&s;ible by impenetrable woods; I was, however, abun|dantly compen&s;ated for my labour, for I &s;aw the &s;ea on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the country, and a pa&s;&s;age leading from it to that on the we&s;t, a little to the ea&s;tward of the entrance of the inlet where the &s;hip now lay. The main land which lay on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of this inlet, appeared to be a narrow ridge of very high hills, and to form part of the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treight; the land on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide appeared to trend away ea&s;t as far as the eye could reach; and to the &s;outh ea&s;t there appeared to be an opening to the &s;ea, which wa&s;hed the ea&s;tern coa&s;t: on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the inlet al&s;o I &s;aw &s;ome i&s;lands which I had before taken to be part of the main land.
<PB N="250" REF="013324_0277_0F8FFBD5CF0F2DC8">
Having made this di&s;covery, I de&s;cended the hill, and as &s;oon as we had taken &s;ome refre&s;hment, we &s;et out on our re|turn to the &s;hip. In our way, we examined the harbours and coves which lie behind the i&s;lands that I had di&s;covered from the hill; and in this rout we &s;aw an old village, in which there were many hou&s;es that &s;eemed to have been long de|&s;erted: we al&s;o &s;aw another village which was inhabited, but the day was too far &s;pent for us to vi&s;it it, and we there|fore made the be&s;t of our way to the &s;hip, which we reached between eight and nine o'clock at night.</P>
<P>The 23d I employed in carrying on a &s;urvey of the place; and upon &s;ome of the i&s;lands where I landed, I &s;aw many hou&s;es which &s;eemed to have been long de&s;erted, and no ap|pearance of any inhabitant.</P>
<P>On the 24th we went to vi&s;it our friends at the Hippah, or village, on the point of the i&s;land near the &s;hip's &s;tation, who had come off to us at our fir&s;t arrival in the bay. They re|ceived us with the utmo&s;t confidence and civility, &s;hewing us every part of their habitations, which were commodious and neat. The i&s;land or rock on which this town is &s;ituated, is divided from the main by a breach or fi&s;&s;ure &s;o narrow, that a man might almo&s;t leap from one to the other: the &s;ides of it are every where &s;o &s;teep as to render an artificial fortification of the&s;e people almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary: there was, however, one &s;light palli&s;ade, and one &s;mall fighting &s;tage, towards that part of the rock where acce&s;s was lea&s;t difficult.</P>
<P>The people here brought us out &s;everal human bones, the fle&s;h of which they had eaten, and offered them to &s;ale; for the curio&s;ity of tho&s;e among us who had purcha&s;ed them as memorials of the horrid practice which many, notwith&s;tand|ing the reports of travellers, have profe&s;&s;ed not to believe, had rendered them a kind of article of trade. In one part of this village we ob&s;erved, not without &s;ome &s;urprize, a cro&s;s ex|actly like that of a crucifix; it was adorned with feathers, and upon our enquiring for what purpo&s;e it had been &s;et up, we were told that it was a monument for a man who was dead: we had before under&s;tood that their dead were not buried, but thrown into the &s;ea; but to our enquiry, how the body of the man had been di&s;po&s;ed of, to who&s;e memory this cro&s;s had been erected, they refu&s;ed to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>When we left the&s;e people, we went to the other end of the i&s;land, and there taking water, cro&s;&s;ed over to the main, where we &s;aw &s;everal hou&s;es, but no inhabitants, except a few in &s;ome &s;traggling canoes, that &s;eemed to be fi&s;hing. After view|ing this place, we returned on board the &s;hip to dinner.</P>
<P>During our vi&s;it to the Indians this day, Tupia being al|ways of our party, they had ob&s;erved to be continually talking of guns, and &s;hooting people: for this &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation
<PB N="251" REF="013324_0278_0F8FFBD6EF71EF60">
we could not at all account; and it had &s;o much engaged our attention, that we talked of it all the way back, and even af|ter we got on board the &s;hip: we had perplexed our&s;elves with various conjectures, which were all given up in their turn; but now we learnt, that on the 21&s;t one of our officers, upon pretence of going out to fi&s;h, had rowed up to the Hippah, and that two or three canoes coming off towards his boat, his fears &s;ugge&s;ted that an attack was intended, in con&s;equence of which three mu&s;kets were fired, one with &s;mall &s;hot, and two with ball, at the Indians, who retired with the utmo&s;t pre|cipitation, having probably come out with friendly intentions, for &s;uch their behaviour both before and afterwards expre&s;&s;ed, having no rea&s;on to expect &s;uch treatment from people who had always behaved to them not only with humanity, but kindne&s;s, and to whom they were not con&s;cious of having given offence.</P>
<P>On the 25th I made another excur&s;ion along the coa&s;t, in the pinnace, towards the mouth of the inlet, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and going on &s;hore at a little cove, to &s;hoot &s;haggs, we fell in with a large family of In|dians, who&s;e cu&s;tom it is to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves among the dif|ferent creeks and coves, where fi&s;h is to be procured in the greate&s;t plenty, leaving a few only in the Hippah, to which the re&s;t repair in times of danger. Some of the&s;e people came out a good way to meet us, and gave us an invitation to go with them to the re&s;t of their party, which we readily ac|cepted. We found a company of about thirty men, women and children, who received us with all po&s;&s;ible demon&s;trations of friend&s;hip. We di&s;tributed among them a few ribands and beads, and in return, received the ki&s;&s;es and embraces of both &s;exes, both young and old: they gave us al&s;o &s;ome fi&s;h, and after a little time we returned, much plea&s;ed with our new acquaintance.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 26th, I went again out in the boat, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and entered one of the bays, which lie on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the inlet, in order to get another fight of the &s;treight, which pa&s;&s;ed between the ea&s;|tern and we&s;tern &s;eas. For this purpo&s;e having landed at a convenient place, we climbed a hill of a very con&s;iderable height, from which we had a full view of it, with the land on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, which we judged to be about four leagues di&s;tant; but as it was hazey in the horizon, we could not &s;ee far to the &s;outh-ea&s;t: I re&s;olved however to &s;earch the pa&s;|&s;age with the &s;hip, as &s;oon as I &s;hould put to &s;ea. Upon the top of this hill we found a parcel of loo&s;e &s;tones, with which we erected a pyramid: and left in it &s;ome mu&s;ket balls, &s;mall &s;hot, beads, and other things, which we happened to have about us, that were likely to &s;tand the te&s;t of time, and not
<PB N="252" REF="013324_0279_0F8FFBD74BC3DB28">
being of Indian workman&s;hip, would convince any European who &s;hould come to the place and pull it down, that other natives of Europe had been there before him. When this was done, we de&s;cended the hill, and made a comfortable meal of the &s;haggs and fi&s;h which our guns and lines had procured us, and which were dre&s;&s;ed by the boat's crew in a place that we had appointed: in this place we found another Indian fami|ly, who received us, as u&s;ual, with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of kind|ne&s;s and plea&s;ure, &s;hewing us where to procure water, and doing us &s;uch other good offices as were in their power. From this place we went to the town, of which the Indians had told us, who vi&s;ited us on the 19th; this, like that which we had &s;een before, was built upon a &s;mall i&s;land or rock, &s;o dif|ficult of acce&s;s, that we gratified our curio&s;ity at the ri&s;k of our necks. The Indians here al&s;o received us with open arms, carried us to every part of the place, and &s;hewed us all that it contained: this town, like the other, con&s;i&s;ted of between eighty and an hundred hou&s;es, and had only one fighting-&s;tage. We happened to have with us a few nails and ribands, and &s;ome paper, with which our gue&s;ts were &s;o gratified, that at our coming away they filled our boat with dried fi&s;h, of which we perceived they had laid up great quantities.</P>
<P>The 27th and 28th were &s;pent in refitting the &s;hip for the &s;ea, fixing a tran&s;om for the tiller, getting &s;tones on board to put into the bottom of the bread room, to bring the &s;hip more by the &s;tern, in repairing the ca&s;ks, and catching fi&s;h.</P>
<P>On the 29th, we received a vi&s;it from our old man, who&s;e name we found to be TOPAA, and three other natives, with whom Tupia had much conver&s;ation. The old man told us, that one of the men who had been fired upon by the officer who had vi&s;ited their Hippah, under pretence of fi&s;hing, was dead; but to my great comfort I afterwards di&s;covered that this report was not true, and that if Topaa's di&s;cour&s;es were taken literally, they would frequently lead us into mi&s;takes. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were &s;everal times on &s;hore during the la&s;t two or three days, not without &s;ucce&s;s, but greatly circum&s;cribed in their walks by climbers of a mo&s;t lu|xuriant growth, which were &s;o interwoven together, as to fill up the &s;pace between the trees about which they grew, and render the woods altogether impa&s;&s;able. This day al&s;o I went on &s;hore again my&s;elf, upon the we&s;tern point of the inlet, and from a hill of con&s;iderable height, I had a view of the coa&s;t to the N. W. The farthe&s;t land I could &s;ee in that quarter, was an i&s;land which has been mentioned before, at the di&s;tance of about ten leagues, lying not far from the main: between this I&s;land and the place where I &s;tood, I di&s;covered clo&s;e under the &s;hore, &s;everal other i&s;lands, forming many bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage for &s;hipping.
<PB N="253" REF="013324_0280_0F8FFBD8374BAF78">
After I had &s;et off the different points for my &s;urvey, I erected another pile of &s;tones, in which I left a piece of &s;ilver coin, with &s;ome mu&s;ket balls and beads, and a piece of an old pen|dant flying on the top. In my return to the &s;hip I made a vi&s;it to &s;everal of the natives, whom I &s;aw along the &s;hore, and purcha&s;ed a &s;mall quantity of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>On the 30th, early in the morning, I &s;ent a boat to one of the i&s;lands for celery, and while the people were gathering it, about twenty of the natives, men, women, and children, landed near &s;ome empty huts: as &s;oon as they were on &s;hore, five or &s;ix of the women &s;at down upon the ground together, and began to cut their legs, arms, and faces, with &s;hells, and &s;harp pieces of talk or ja&s;per, in a terrible manner. Our people under&s;tood that their hu&s;bands had lately been killed by their enemies; but while they were performing this horrid ceremo|ny, the men &s;et about repairing the huts, with the utmo&s;t ne|gligence and unconcern.</P>
<P>The carpenter having prepared two po&s;ts to be left as me+morials of our having vi&s;ited this place, I ordered them to be in&s;cribed with the &s;hip's name, and the year and month; one of them I &s;et up at the watering-place, hoi&s;ting the Union flag upon the top of it; and the other I carried over to the i&s;land that lies neare&s;t the &s;ea, called by the natives MOTUARA. I went fir&s;t to the village or Hippah, accompanied by Mr. Monkhou&s;e and Tupia, where I met with our old man, and told him and &s;everal others, by means of Tupia, that we were come to &s;et up a mark upon the i&s;land, in order to &s;hew to any other &s;hip, which &s;hould happen to come thither, that we had been there before. To this they readily con&s;ented, and promi&s;ed that they never would pull it down: I then gave &s;omething to every one pre&s;ent; and to the old man I gave a &s;ilver three-pence, dated 1736, and &s;ome &s;pike nails, with the King's broad arrow cut deep upon them; things which I tho't mo&s;t likely to remain long among them: I then took the po&s;t to the highe&s;t part of the i&s;land, and after fixing it firmly in the ground, I hoi&s;ted upon it the Union flag, and honoured this inlet with the name of QUEEN CHARLOTTE's SOUND, at the &s;ame time taking formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this and the ad|jacent country, in the name and for the u&s;e of his Maje&s;ty King George the Third. We then drank a bottle of wine to her Maje&s;ty's health, and gave the bottle to the old man, who had attended us up the hill, and who was mightily de|lighted with his pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>While the po&s;t was &s;etting up, we enquired of the old man concerning the pa&s;&s;age into the ea&s;tern &s;ea, the exi&s;tence of which he confirmed; and then a&s;ked him about the land to the S. W. of the &s;treight, where we were then &s;ituated: this land, he &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of two Whennuas, or i&s;land, which
<PB N="254" REF="013324_0281_0F8FFBDA67509EF8">
might be circumnavigated in a few days, and which he called TOVY POENAMMOO, the literal tran&s;lation of this word is, "the water of green talc:" and probably if we had under&s;tood him better, we &s;hould have found that TOVY Poenammoo was the name of &s;ome particular place where they got the green talc or &s;tone of which they make their ornaments and tools, and not a general name for the whole &s;outhern di&s;trict: he &s;aid, there was al&s;o a third Whennua, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treight, the circumnavigation of which would take up many moons: this he called EAHEINOMAUWE; and to the land on the borders of the &s;treight he gave the name of TIERA WITTF. Having &s;et up our po&s;t, and procured this intelligence, we returned on board the &s;hip, and brought the old man with us, who was attended by his canoe, in which, after dinner, he returned home.</P>
<P>On the 22&s;t having compleated our woodding, and filled all our water ca&s;ks, I &s;ent out two parties, one to cut and make brooms, and another to catch fi&s;h, in the evening we had a &s;trong gale from the N. W. with &s;uch a heavy rain that our little wild mu&s;icians on &s;hore &s;u&s;pended their &s;ong, which till now we had con&s;tantly heard during the night, with a plea&s;ure which it was impo&s;&s;ible to loo&s;e without regret.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t the gale increa&s;ed to a &s;torm, with heavy gu&s;ts from the high land, one of which broke the haw&s;er, that we had fa&s;tened to the &s;hore, and obliged us to let go another anchor. Towards midnight the gale became more mode|rate, but the rain continued with &s;uch violence, that the brook which had &s;upplied us with water overflowed its banks, and carried away ten &s;mall ca&s;ks which had been left there full of water, and notwith&s;tanding we &s;earched the whole cove, we could never recover one of them.</P>
<P>On the third, as I intended to &s;ail the fir&s;t opportunity, I went over to the Hippah on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;ound, and purcha&s;ed a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;plit and half-dried fi&s;h, for &s;ea &s;tores. The people here confirmed all that the old man had told us concerning the &s;treight and the country, and about noon I took leave of them: &s;ome of them &s;eemed to be &s;orry, and others glad, that we were going: the fi&s;h which I had bought they &s;old freely, but there were &s;ome who &s;hewed ma|nife&s;t &s;igns of di&s;approbation. As we returned to the &s;hip, &s;ome of us made an excur&s;ion along the &s;hore to the northward, to traffic with the natives for a farther &s;upply of fi&s;h; in which, however, they had no great &s;ucce&s;s. In the evening, we got every thing off from the &s;hore, as I intended to &s;ail in the morning, but the wind would not permit.</P>
<P>On the fourth, while we were waiting for a wind, we amu&s;ed our&s;elves with fi&s;hing, and gathering &s;hells and &s;eeds of various kinds; and early in the morning of the 5th, we
<PB N="255" REF="013324_0282_0F8FFBDB4BF6C268">
ca&s;t off the haw&s;er, hove &s;hort on the bower, and carried the kedge anchor out in order to warp the &s;hip out of the cove, which having done about two o'clock in the afternoon, we hove up the anchor and got under &s;ail; but the wind &s;oon failing, we were obliged to come to an anchor again a little above Motuara. When we were under &s;ail, our old man To|paa came on board to take leave of us, and as we were &s;till de|&s;irous of making farther enquiries, whether any memory of Ta&s;man had been pre&s;erved among the&s;e people, Tupia was directed to a&s;k him whether he had ever heard that &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el as ours had before vi&s;ited the country. To this he replied in the negative, but &s;aid, that his ance&s;tors had told him there had once come to this place a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, from a di&s;tant country, called UDIMAROA, in which were four men, who, upon their coming on &s;hore, were all killed: upon being a&s;ked where this di&s;tant land lay, he pointed to the north|ward. Of Ulimaroa we had heard &s;omething before, from the people about the Bay of I&s;lands, who &s;aid that their an|ce&s;tors had vi&s;ited it; and Tupia had al&s;o talked to us of Uli|maroa, concerning which he had &s;ome confu&s;ed traditionary notions, not very different from tho&s;e of our old man, &s;o that we could draw no certain conclu&s;ions from the accounts of ei|ther.</P>
<P>Soon after the &s;hip came to an anchor the &s;econd time, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on &s;hore, to &s;ee if any gleanings of natural knowledge remained, and by accident fell in with the mo&s;t agreeable Indian family they had &s;een, which afforded them a better opportunity of remarking the per&s;onal &s;ubordination among the&s;e people, than had before offered. The principal per&s;ons were a widow, and a pretty boy about ten years old: the widow was mourning for her hu&s;band with tears of blood, according to their cu&s;tom, and the child, by the death of its father, was become proprietor of the land where we had cut our wood. The mother and the &s;on were &s;itting upon matts, and the re&s;t of the family, to the number of &s;ix|teen or &s;eventeen, of both &s;exes, &s;at round them in the open air, for they did not appear to have any hou&s;e, or other &s;hel|ter from the weather, the inclemencies of which, cu&s;tom has probably enabled them to endure without any la&s;ting incon|venience. Their whole behaviour was affable, obliging, and un&s;u&s;picious; they pre&s;ented each per&s;on with fi&s;h, and a brand of fire to dre&s;s it, and pre&s;&s;ed them many times to &s;tay till the morning, which they would certainly have done if they had not expected the &s;hip to &s;ail, greatly regretting that they had not become acquainted with them &s;ooner, as they made no doubt but that more knowledge of the manners and di&s;po|&s;ition of the inhabitants of this country would have been ob|tained
<PB N="256" REF="013324_0283_0F8FFBDC70B9C910">
from them in a day, than they had been able to acquire during our whole &s;tay upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 6th, about &s;ix o'clock in the morning a light breeze &s;prung up at north, and we again got under &s;ail, but the wind proving variable, we reached no farther than ju&s;t with|out Motuara; in the afternoon, however, a more &s;teady gale at N. by W. &s;et us clear of the Sound, which I &s;hall now de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound is &s;ituated in la|titude 41&deg; S. longitude 184&deg; 45&prime; W. and near the middle of the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treight in which it lies. The land of the &s;outh ea&s;t head of the Sound, called by the natives KOAMAROO, off which lie two &s;mall i&s;lands and &s;ome rocks, makes the narrowe&s;t part of the &s;treight. From the north we&s;t head a reef of rocks runs out about two miles, in the direction of N. E. by N. part of which is above the water, and part below. By this account of the heads, the Sound will be &s;ufficiently known: at the entrance, it is three leagues broad, and lies in S. W. by S. S. W. and W. S. W. at lea&s;t ten leagues, and is a collection of &s;ome of the fine&s;t harbours in the world, as will appear from the plan, which is laid down with all the accuracy that time and circum&s;tances would admit. The land forming the harbour or cove in which we lay, is called by the natives TOTARRANUE: the harbour it&s;elf, which I called SHIP COVE, is not inferior to any in the found, either for convenience or &s;afety: it lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;ound, and is the &s;outhermo&s;t of three coves, that are &s;ituated within the i&s;land of Motuara, which bears ea&s;t of it. Ship Cove may be entered, either between Mo|tuara and a long i&s;land, called by the natives HAMOTE, or between Motuara and the we&s;tern &s;hore. In the la&s;t of the&s;e channels are two ledges of rocks, three fathom under water, which may ea&s;ily be known by the &s;ea-weed that grows upon them. In &s;ailing either in or out of the &s;ound, with little wind, attention mu&s;t be had to the tides, which flow about nine or ten o'clock at the full and change of the moon, and ri&s;e and fall between &s;even and eight feet perpen|dicularly. The flood comes in through the &s;treight from the S. E. and &s;ets &s;trongly over upon the north we&s;t head, and the reef that lies off it; the ebb &s;ets with &s;till greater rapidity to the S. E. over upon the rocks and i&s;lands that lie off the &s;outh ea&s;t head. The variation of the compa&s;s we found from good ob&s;ervation to be 13&deg; 5&prime; E.</P>
<P>The land about this &s;ound, which is of &s;uch a height that we &s;aw it at the di&s;tance of twenty leagues, con&s;i&s;ts wholly of high hills and deep vallies, well &s;tored with a variety of ex|cellent timber, fit for all purpo&s;es except ma&s;ts, for which it is too hard and heavy. The &s;ea abounds with a variety of
<PB N="257" REF="013324_0284_0F90F2C0C6E1C7A0">
fi&s;h, &s;o that without going out of the cove where we lay, we caught every day, with the &s;eine and hooks and lines, a quan|tity &s;ufficient to &s;erve the whole &s;hip's company: and along the &s;hore we found plenty of &s;hags, and a few other &s;pecies of wild fowl, which tho&s;e who have long lived upon &s;alt pro|vi&s;ions will not think de&s;picable food.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants &s;carcely exceeds four hundred, and they live di&s;per&s;ed along the &s;hores, where their food, con&s;i&s;ting of fi&s;h and fern roots, is mo&s;t ea&s;ily procured; for we &s;aw no cultivated ground. Upon any appearance of dan|ger, they retire to their hippahs, or forts; in this &s;ituation we found them, and in this &s;ituation they continued for &s;ome time after our arrival. In compari&s;on of the inhabitants of other parts of this country, they are poor, and their canoes are without ornament: the little traffic we had with them was wholly for fi&s;h, and indeed they had &s;carcely any thing el&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of. They &s;eemed, however, to have &s;ome knowledge of iron, which the inhabitants of &s;ome other parts had not; for they willingly took nails for their fi&s;h, and &s;ometimes &s;eemed to prefer it to every thing el&s;e that we could offer, which had not always been the ca&s;e. They were at fir&s;t very fond of paper; but when they found that it was &s;poiled by being wet, they would not take it: neither did they &s;et much value upon the cloth of Otaheite; but Engli&s;h broad cloth, and red ker&s;ey were in high e&s;timation; which &s;hewed that they had &s;en&s;e enough to appretiate the commodities which were offered by their u&s;e, which is more than could be &s;aid of &s;ome of their neighbours, who made a much better appearance. Their dre&s;s has been mentioned already, particularly their large round head-dre&s;&s;es of feathers, which were far from be|ing unbecoming.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we got out of the Sound, I &s;tood over to the ea&s;tward, in order to get the &s;treight well open before the tide of ebb came on. At &s;even in the evening, the two &s;mall i&s;lands which lie off Cape Koamaroo, the &s;outh ea&s;t head of Queen Charlotte's Sound, bore ea&s;t, di&s;tant about four miles: at this time it was nearly calm, and the tide of ebb &s;etting out, we were, in a very &s;hort time, carried by the rapidity of the &s;tream clo&s;e upon one of the i&s;lands, which was a rock ri&s;ing almo&s;t perpendicularly out of the &s;ea: we perceived our danger increa&s;e every moment, and had but one expedient to prevent our being da&s;hed to pieces, the &s;ucce&s;s of which a few minutes would determine. We were now within little more than a cable's length of the rock, and had more than &s;eventy-five fathom water; but upon dropping an anchor, and veering about one hundred and fifty fathom of cable, the &s;hip was happily brought up: this, however, would not have &s;aved us, if the tide which &s;et S. by E. had not, upon meeting
<PB N="258" REF="013324_0285_0F8FFBDC92269F28">
with the i&s;land, changed its direction to S. E. and carried us beyond the fir&s;t point. In this &s;ituation we were not above two cable's length from the rocks; and here we remained in the &s;trength of the tide, which &s;et to the S. E. after the rate of at lea&s;t five miles an hour, from a little after &s;even till near midnight, when the tide abated, and we began to heave. By three in the morning the anchor was at the bows, and having a light breeze at N. W. we made &s;ail for the ea&s;tern &s;hore; but the tide being again&s;t us, we made but little way: the wind however afterwards fre&s;hened, and came to N. and N. E. with which, and the tide of ebb, we were in a &s;hort time hurried through the narrowe&s;t part of the &s;treight, and then &s;tood away for the &s;outhermo&s;t land we had in &s;ight, which bore from us S. by W. Over this land appeared a mountain of &s;tupendous height, which was covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>The narrowe&s;t part of the &s;treight, through which we had been driven with &s;uch rapidity, lies between Cape Tiera|witte, on the coa&s;t of Eaheinomauvie, and Cape Koamaroo: the di&s;tance between them I judged to be between four or five leagues, and notwith&s;tanding the tide, now its &s;trength is known, may be pa&s;&s;ed without much danger. It is however &s;afe&s;t to keep on the north ea&s;t &s;hore, for on that &s;ide there ap|peared to be nothing to fear; but on the other &s;hore there are not only the i&s;lands and rocks which lie off Cape Koa|maroo, but a reef of rocks &s;tretching from the&s;e i&s;lands &s;ix or &s;even miles to the &s;outhward, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles from the &s;hore, which I had di&s;covered from the hill when I took my &s;econd view of the &s;treight from the ea&s;t to the we&s;tern &s;ea. The length of the &s;treight we had pa&s;&s;ed I &s;hall not pretend to a&s;&s;ign.</P>
<P>About nine leagues north from Cape Tierawitte, and un|der the &s;ame &s;hore, is a high and remarkable i&s;land which may be di&s;tinctly &s;een from Queen Charlotte's Sound, from which it is di&s;tant about &s;ix or &s;even leagues. This i&s;land, which was noticed when we pa&s;&s;ed it on the 14th of January, I have called ENTRY ISLE.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;t &s;ide of Cape Tierawitte, the land trends away S. E. by E. about eight leagues, where it ends in a point, and is the &s;outhermo&s;t land on Eaheinomauwe. To this point I have given the name of CAPE PALLISER, in honour of my worthy friend Captain Palli&s;er. It lies in latitude 41&deg; 34&prime; S. longitude 183&deg; 58&prime; W. and bore from us this day at noon S. 79 E. di&s;tant about thirteen leagues, the &s;hip being then in the latitude of 41&deg; 27&prime; S.; Koamaroo at the &s;ame time bear N. &frac12; E. di&s;tant &s;even or eight leagues. The &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore S. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">6 W. and the &s;nowy mountains S. W. At this time we were about three leagues from the &s;hore, and abrea&s;t of a deep bay or inlet, to which I gave the name of
<PB N="259" REF="013324_0286_0F8FFBDD4F7DFCF8">
CLOUDY BAY, and at the bottom of which there appeared low land covered with tall trees.</P>
<P>At three o'clock in the afternoon we were abrea&s;t of the &s;outhermo&s;t point of land that we had &s;een at noon which I called CAPE CAMPBEL; it lies S. by W. di&s;tant between twelve and thirteen leagues from Cape Koamaroo, in lati|tude 41&deg; 44&prime; S. longitude 183&deg; 45&prime; W.; and with Cape Pal|li&s;er forms the &s;outhern entrance of the &s;treight, the di&s;tance between them being between thirteen and fourteen leagues W. by S. and E. by N.</P>
<P>From this cape we &s;teered along the &s;hore S. W. by S. till eight o'clock in the evening, when the wind died away. About half an hour afterwards, however, a fre&s;h breeze &s;prung up at S. W. and I put the &s;hip right before it. My rea&s;on for this, was a notion which &s;ome of the officers had ju&s;t &s;tarted, that Eahienomauwe was not an i&s;land, and that the land might &s;tretch away to the S. E. from between Cape Turnagain and Cape Palli&s;er, there being a &s;pace of between twelve and fifteen leagues that we had not &s;een. I had in|deed the &s;tronge&s;t conviction that they were mi&s;taken, not only from what I had &s;een the fir&s;t time I di&s;covered the &s;treight, but from many other concurrent te&s;timonies that the land in que&s;tion was an i&s;land; but being re&s;olved to leave no po&s;&s;ibility of doubt with re&s;pect to an object of &s;uch im|portance, I took the opportunity of the wind's &s;hifting, to &s;tand ea&s;tward, and accordingly &s;teered N. E. by E. all the night. At nine o'clock in the morning we were abrea&s;t of Cape Palli&s;er, and found the land trend away N. E. to|wards Cape Turnagain, which I reckoned to be di&s;tant about twenty-&s;ix leagues; however, as the weather was hazy, &s;o as to prevent our &s;eeing above four or five leagues, I &s;till kept &s;tanding to the N. E. with a light breeze at &s;outh; and at noon Cape Palli&s;er bore N. 72 W. di&s;tant about three leagues.</P>
<P>About three o'clock in the afternoon, three canoes came up to the &s;hip with between thirty and forty people on board, who had been pulling after us with great labour and per&s;e|verance for &s;ome time: they appeared to be more cleanly, and a better cla&s;s, than any we had met with &s;ince we left the Bay of I&s;lands, and their canoes were al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame ornaments which we had &s;een upon the northerly part of the coa&s;t. They came on board with very little invitation; and their behaviour was courteous and friendly: upon re|ceiving pre&s;ents from us, they made us pre&s;ents in return, which had not been done by any of the natives that we had &s;een before. We &s;oon perceived that our gue&s;ts had heard of us, for as &s;oon as they came on board, they a&s;ked for <HI>Whow,</HI> the name by which nails were known among the people with whom we had trafficked: but though they had heard of nail,
<PB N="260" REF="013324_0287_0F90F2C2353EA938">
it was plain they had &s;een none; for when nails were given them, they a&s;ked Tupia what they were. The term <HI>Whow,</HI> indeed, conveyed to them the idea not of their quality, but only of their u&s;e; for it is the &s;ame by which they di&s;tingui&s;h a tool, commonly made of bone, which they u&s;e both as an augur and a chi&s;&s;el. However, their knowing that we had <HI>Whow</HI> to &s;ell, was a proof that their connections extended as far north as Cape Kidnappers, which was di&s;tant no le&s;s than forty-five leagues; for that was the &s;outhermo&s;t place on this &s;ide the coa&s;t where we had any traffic with the natives. It is al&s;o probable, that the little knowledge which the inhabitants of Queen Charlotte's Sound had of iron, they obtained from their neighbours at Tierawitte; for we had no rea&s;on to think that the inhabitants of any part of this coa&s;t had the lea&s;t knowledge of iron, or its u&s;e, before we came among them, e&s;pecially as when it was fir&s;t offered they &s;eemed to di&s;regard it as of no value. We thought it probable, that we were now once more in the territories of Teratu; but upon enquiring of the&s;e people, they &s;aid that he was not their king. After a &s;hort time, they went away, much gra|tified with the pre&s;ents that we had made them; and we pur|&s;ued our cour&s;e along the &s;hore to the N. E. till eleven o'clock the next morning. About this time, the weather hap|pening to clear up, we &s;aw Cape Turnagain, bearing N. by E. &frac12; E. at the di&s;tance of about &s;even leagues: I then called the officers upon deck, and a&s;ked them, whether they were not now &s;atisfied, that Eahienomauwe was an i&s;land; they readily an&s;wered in the affirmative, and all doubts being now removed, we hauled our wind to the ea&s;tward.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>AT four o'clock in the afternoon, of Friday the 9th of February, having tacked, we &s;tood S. W. and con|tinued to make &s;ail to the &s;outhward till &s;un&s;et on the 11th, when a fre&s;h breeze at N. E. had carried us back again the length of Cape Palli&s;er, of which, as the weather was clear, we had a good view. Between the foot of the high land and the &s;ea there is a low flat border, off which there are &s;ome rocks that appear above water. Between this Cape and Cape Turnagain, the land near the &s;hore is, in many places, low and flat, and has a green and plea&s;ant appearance; but farther from the &s;ea it ri&s;es into hills. The land between Cape Palli&s;er and Cape Tierawitte is high, and makes in table-points; it al&s;o &s;eemed to us to form two bays, but we were at too great a di&s;tance from this part of the coa&s;t, to judge ac|curately from appearances. The wind having been variable with calms, we had advanced no farther by the 12th at noon than latitude 41:52, Cape Palli&s;er then bearing north, di&s;tant about five leagues; and the &s;nowy mountain S. 83 W.</P>
<P>At noon on the 13th, we found our&s;elves in the latitude of 42:2 S.; Cape Palli&s;er bearing N. 20 E. di&s;tant eight leagues. In the afternoon a fre&s;h gale &s;prung up at N. E. and we &s;teered S. W. by W. for the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight, which at &s;un&s;et bore from us S. 74 W. At this time the va|riation was 15:4 E.</P>
<P>At eight o'clock in the morning of the 14th, having run one and twenty leagues S. 58 W. &s;ince the preceeding noon, it fell calm. We were then abrea&s;t of the &s;nowy mountain, which bore from us N. W. and in this direction lay behind a mountainous ridge of nearly the &s;ame height, which ri&s;es di|rectly from the &s;ea, and runs parallel with the &s;hore, which lies N. E. &frac12; N. and S. W. &frac12; S. The north we&s;t end of the ridge ri&s;es inland, not far from Cape Campbell; and both the mountain and the ridge are di&s;tinctly &s;een as well from Cape Koamaroo as Cape Palli&s;er: from Koamaroo they are
<PB N="2" REF="013324_0291_0F90F26B073CEBA8">
di&s;tant two and twenty leagues S. W. &frac12; S.; and from Cape Palli&s;er thirty leagues W. S. W.; and are of a height &s;uffi|cient to be &s;een at a much greater di&s;tance. At noon this day, we were in latitude 42:34 S. The &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore S. W. &frac12; W.; and &s;ome low land that appeared like an i&s;land, and lay clo&s;e under the foot of the ridge, bore N. W. by N. about five or &s;ix leagues.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, when Mr. Banks was out in the boat a &s;hooting, we &s;aw, with our gla&s;&s;es, four double canoes, having on board fifty-&s;even men, put off from that &s;hore, and make towards him: we immediately made &s;ignals for him to come on board; but the &s;hip, with re&s;pect to him, being right in the wake of the &s;un, he did not &s;ee them. We were at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and he was at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from the &s;hip, which was between him and the &s;hore; &s;o that, it being a dead calm, I began to be in &s;ome pain for him, fearing that he might not &s;ee the canoes time enough to reach the &s;hip before they &s;hould get up with him: &s;oon after, however, we &s;aw his boat in motion, and had the plea&s;ure to take him on board before the Indians came up, who probably had not &s;een him, as their attention &s;eemed to be wholly fixed upon the &s;hip. They came within about a &s;tone's ca&s;t, and then &s;topped, gazing at us with a look of va|cant a&s;toni&s;hment: Tupia exerted all his eloquence to prevail upon them to come nearer, but without any effect. After &s;ur|veying us for &s;ome time, they left us, and made towards the &s;hore; but had not mea&s;ured more than half the di&s;tance be|tween that and the &s;hip before it was dark. We imagined that the&s;e people had heard nothing of us, and could not but remark the different behaviour and di&s;po&s;itions of the inhabi|tants of the different parts of this coa&s;t upon their fir&s;t ap|proaching the ve&s;&s;el. The&s;e kept aloof with a mixture of ti|midity and wonder; others had immediately commenced ho&s;|tilities, by pelting us with &s;tones: the gentleman whom we had found alone, fi&s;hing in his boat, &s;eemed to think us en|tirely unworthy of his notice; and &s;ome, almo&s;t without in|vitation, had come on board with an air of perfect confidence and good-will. From the behaviour of our la&s;t vi&s;itors, I gave the land from which they had put off, and which, as I have before ob&s;erved, had the appearance of an i&s;land, the name of LOOKERS-ON</P>
<P>At eight o'clock in the evening, a breeze &s;prung up at S. S. W. with which I &s;tretched off &s;outh ea&s;t, becau&s;e &s;ome on board thought they &s;aw land in that quarter. In this cour&s;e we continued till &s;ix o'clock the next morning, when we had run eleven leagues, but &s;aw no land, except that which we had left. Having &s;tood to the S. E. with a light breeze, which veered from the we&s;t to the north, till noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 42:56 S. and the high land that we were
<PB N="3" REF="013324_0292_0F905036352BFFE0">
abrea&s;t of the preceeding noon bore N. N. W. &frac12; W. In the Afternoon we had a light breeze at N. E. with which we &s;teered we&s;t, edging in for the land, which was di&s;tant about eight leagues. At &s;even in the evening, we were about &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore, and the &s;outhermo&s;t extremity of the land in &s;ight bore W. S. W.</P>
<P>At day-break on the 16th, we di&s;covered land bearing S. by W. and &s;eemingly detached from the coa&s;t we were upon. About eight, a breeze &s;prung up, at N. by E. and we &s;teered directly for it. At noon, we were in latitude 43:19 S. the peak on the &s;nowy mountain bore N. 20 E. di&s;tant twenty-&s;even leagues; the &s;outhern extremity of the land we could &s;ee bore we&s;t, and the land which had been di&s;covered in the morning appeared like an i&s;land extending from S. S. W. to S. W. by W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant about eight leagues. In the after|noon we &s;tood to the &s;outhward of it, with a fre&s;h breeze at north: at eight in the evening, we had run eleven leagues, and the land then extended from S. W. by W. to N. by W. We were then di&s;tant about three or four leagues from the neare&s;t &s;hore, and in this &s;ituation had fifty fathom water, with a fine &s;andy bottom. The variation of the compa&s;s by this morning's amplitude was 14:39 E.</P>
<P>At &s;un-ri&s;e, the next morning, our opinion that the land we had been &s;tanding for was an i&s;land, was confirmed, by our &s;eeing part of the land of Tovy Poenammoo open to the we&s;t|ward of it, extending as far as W. by S. At eight in the morning, the extremes of the i&s;land bore N. 76 W. and N. N. E. E.: and an opening near the &s;outh point, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the appearance of a bay or harbour, N. 20 W. di&s;tant between three and four leagues: in this &s;ituation we had thirty-eight fathom water, with a brown &s;andy bottom.</P>
<P>This i&s;land, which I named after Mr. Banks, lies about five leagues from the coa&s;t of Tovy Poenammoo; the &s;outh point bears S. 21 W. from the highe&s;t peak on the &s;nowy mountain, and lies in latitude 43:32 S. and in longitude 186:30 W. by an ob&s;ervation of the &s;un and moon which was made this morning: it is of a circular figure, and about 24 leagues in compa&s;s: it is &s;ufficiently high to be &s;een at the di&s;tance of twelve or fifteen leagues, and the land has a broken irregular &s;urface, with the appearance rather of barrenne&s;s than fertility; yet it was inhabited, for we &s;aw &s;moke in one place, and a few &s;traggling natives in another.</P>
<P>When this i&s;land was fir&s;t di&s;covered in the direction of S. by W. &s;ome per&s;ons on board were of opinion that they al&s;o &s;aw land bearing S. S. E. and S. E. by E. I was my&s;elf upon the deck at the time, and told them, that in my opinion it was no more than a cloud, and that as the &s;un ro&s;e it would di&s;&s;ipate and vani&s;h. However, as I was determined to leave no &s;ubject for di&s;putation which experiment could remove, I
<PB N="4" REF="013324_0293_0F90F26BB77DA870">
ordered the &s;hip to be wore, and &s;teered E. S. E. by compa&s;s, in the direction which the land was &s;aid to bear from us at that time. At noon we were in latitude 44:7 S.; the &s;outh point of Banks's I&s;land bearing north, di&s;tant five leagues. By &s;even o'clock at night we had run eight and twenty miles, when &s;eeing no land, nor any &s;igns of any, but that which we had left, we bore away S. by W. and continued upon that cour&s;e till the next day at noon, when we were in latitude 45:16, the &s;outh point of Banks's i&s;land bearing N. 6:30 W. di&s;tant twenty eight leagues. The variation by the azimuth this morning was 15:30 E. As no &s;igns of land had yet appeared to the &s;outhward, and as I thought that we had &s;tood far enough in that direction to weather all the land we had left, judging from the report of the natives in Queen Char|lotte's Sound, I hauled to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>We had a moderate breeze at N. N. W. and N. till eight in the evening, when it became un&s;ettled; and at ten fixed at &s;outh: during the night, it blew with &s;uch violence that it brought us under our clo&s;e reefed top&s;ails. At eight the next morning, having run twenty-eight leagues upon a W. by N. &frac12; N. cour&s;e, and judging our&s;elves to be to the we&s;tward of the land of Tovy Poenammoo, we bore away N. W. with a fre&s;h gale at &s;outh. At ten, having run eleven miles upon this cour&s;e, we &s;aw land extending from the S. W. to the N. W. at the di&s;tance of about ten leagues, which we hauled up for. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 44:38, the &s;outh ea&s;t point of Banks's I&s;land bore N. 58:30 E. di&s;tant thirty leagues, and the main body of the land in &s;ight W. by N. A head &s;ea prevented us from making much way to the &s;outh|ward; at &s;even in the evening the extremes of the land &s;tretch|ed from S. W. by S. to N. by W.; and at &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore we had thirty-two fathom water. At four o'clock the next morning, we &s;tood in for the &s;hore W. by S. and dur|ing a cour&s;e of four leagues, our depth of water was from thir|ty-two to thirteen fathom. When it was thirteen fathom we were but three miles di&s;tant from the &s;hore, and therefore &s;tood off; its direction is here nearly N. and S. The &s;urface, to the di&s;tance of about five miles from the &s;ea, is low and flat; but it then ri&s;es into hills of a con&s;iderable height. It appeared to be totally barren, and we &s;aw no &s;igns of its being inhabited. Our latitude, at noon, was 44:44; and the longitude which we made from Banks's I&s;land to this place was 2:22 W. During the la&s;t twenty-four hours, though we carried as much &s;ail as the &s;hip would bear, we were driven three leagues to the leeward.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand off and on all this day and the next, keeping at the di&s;tance of between four and twelve leagues from the &s;hore, and having water from thirty-five to fifty-three fathom. On the 22d, at noon, we had no ob&s;ervation, but by
<PB N="5" REF="013324_0294_0F90F26C814A1018">
the land judged our&s;elves to be about three leagues farther north than we had been the day before. At &s;un-&s;et, the wea|ther, which had been hazey, clearing up, we &s;aw a mountain which ro&s;e in a high peak, bearing N. W. by N.; and at the &s;ame time, we &s;aw the land more di&s;tinctly than before, ex|tending from N. to S. W. by S. which, at &s;ome di&s;tance with|in the coa&s;t, had a lofty and mountainous appearance. We &s;oon found that the accounts which had been given us by the Indians in Queen Charlotte's Sound of the land to the &s;outh|ward were not true; for they had told us that it might be cir|cumnavigated in four days.</P>
<P>On the 23d, having a hollow &s;well from the S. E. and ex|pecting wind from the &s;ame quarter, we kept plying between &s;even and fifteen leagues from the &s;hore, having from &s;eventy to 44 fathom. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 44:40 S. and our longitude from Banks's I&s;land 1:31 W. From this time to &s;ix in the evening it was calm; but a light breeze then &s;pringing up at E. N. E. we &s;teered S. S. E. all night, edging off from the land, the hollow &s;well &s;till conti|nuing; our depth of water was from &s;ixty to &s;eventy-five fa|thom. While we were becalmed, Mr. Banks, being out in the boat, &s;hot two Port Egmont hens, which were in every re|&s;pect the &s;ame as tho&s;e that are found in great numbers upon the i&s;land of Faro, and were the fir&s;t of the kind we had &s;een upon this coa&s;t, though we fell in with &s;ome a few days before we made land.</P>
<P>At day-break, the wind fre&s;hened, and before noon we had a &s;trong gale at N. N. E. At eight in the morning we &s;aw the land extending as far as S. W. by S. and &s;teered directly for it. At noon we were in latitude 45:22 S.; and the land which now &s;tretched from S. W. &frac12; S. to N. N. W. appeared to be rudely diver&s;ified by hill and valley. In the afternoon, we &s;teered S. W. by S. and S. W. edging in for the land with a fre&s;h gale at north; but though we were at no great di&s;tance, the weather was &s;o hazey that we could &s;ee nothing di&s;tinctly upon it, except a ridge of high hills, lying not far from the &s;ea, and parallel to the coa&s;t, which in this place &s;tretches S. by W. and N. by E. and &s;eemed to end in a high bluff point to the &s;outhward. By eight in the evening we were abrea&s;t of this point; but it being then dark, and I not knowing which way the land trended, we brought to for the night. At this time, the point bore we&s;t, and was di&s;tant about five miles: our depth of water was thirty-&s;even fathom, and the bottom con&s;i&s;ted of &s;mall pebbles.</P>
<P>At day-break, having made &s;ail, the point bore north, di&s;|tant three leagues, and we now found that the land trended from it S. W. by W. as far as we could &s;ee. This point I named CAPE SAUNDERS, in honour of Sir Charles. Our latitude was 45:35 S. and longitude 189:4 W. By the la|titude,
<PB N="6" REF="013324_0295_0F90EC9AF2CE39C0">
and the angles that are made by the coa&s;t, this point will be &s;ufficiently known; there is, however, about three or four leagues to the &s;outh we&s;t of it, and very near the &s;hore, a remarkable &s;addle-hill, which is a good direction to it on that quarter. From one league to four leagues north of Cape Saun|ders, the &s;hore forms two or three bays, in which there ap|peared to be good anchorage, and effectual &s;helter from the S. W. we&s;terly, and N. we&s;terly winds; but my de&s;ire of getting to the &s;outhward, in order to a&s;certain whether this country was an i&s;land or continent, prevented my putting into any of them.</P>
<P>We kept at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore all this morning, with the Wind at S. W. and had a very di&s;tinct view of it: it is of a moderate height, and the &s;urface is broken by many hills, which are green and woody; but we &s;aw no appearance of inhabitants. At noon, Cape Saunders bore N. 30 W. di&s;|tant about four leagues. We had variable winds and calms, till five o'clock in the evening, when it fixed at W. S. W. and &s;oon blew &s;o hard that it put us pa&s;t our top&s;ails, and &s;plit the fore&s;ail all to pieces: after getting another to the yard, we continued to &s;tand to the &s;outhward under two cour&s;es; and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix the next morning, the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore W. by N. and Cape Saunders N. by W. di&s;tant eight leagues: at noon, it bore N. 20 W. fourteen leagues; and our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 46:36. The gale continued with heavy &s;qualls, and a large hollow &s;ea all the afternoon; and at &s;even in the evening, we lay too under our fore&s;ail, with the &s;hip's head to the &s;outhward: at noon on the 27th, our latitude was 46:54, and our longitude from Cape Saunders 1:24 E. At &s;even in the evening, we made &s;ail under our cour&s;es; and at eight the next morning &s;et the top&s;ails clo&s;e reefed. At noon our latitude was 47:43, and our longitude ea&s;t from Cape Saunders 2:10. At this time, we wore and &s;tood to the northward: in the afternoon, we found the variation to be 16:34 E. At eight in the evening, we tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outhward, with the wind at we&s;t.</P>
<P>At noon this day, our latitude by account was 47:52, and our longitude from Cape Saunders 1:8 E. We &s;tood to the &s;outhward till half an hour pa&s;t three in the afternoon; and then, being in latitude 48 S. and longitude 188 W. and &s;ee|ing no appearance of land, we tacked and &s;tood to the north|ward, having a large &s;well from the S. W. by W. At noon the next day, our latitude was 46:42 S.; and Cape Saunders bore N. 46 W. di&s;tant eighty-&s;ix miles. The &s;outh we&s;t &s;well continuing till the 3d, confirmed our opinion, that there was no land in that quarter. At four in the Afternoon, we &s;tood to the we&s;tward with all the &s;ail we could make. In the morn|ing of the 4th, we found the variation to be 16:16 E. This they we &s;aw &s;ome whales and &s;eals, as we had done &s;everal
<PB N="7" REF="013324_0296_0F9050366ABA2028">
times after our having pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treight; but we &s;aw no &s;eal while we were upon the coa&s;t of Eahienomauwe. We &s;oun|ded both in the night and this morning, but had no ground with one hundred and fifty fathom. At noon, we &s;aw Cape Saunders bearing N. &frac12; W.; and our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 46:31 S. At half an hour pa&s;t one o'clock, we &s;aw land bearing W. by S. which we &s;teered for, and before it was dark were within three or four miles of it: during the whole night we &s;aw fires upon it, and at &s;even in the morning were within about three leagues of the &s;hore, which appeared to be high, but level. At three o'clock in the afternoon we &s;aw the land extending from N. E. by N. to N. W. &frac12; N.; and &s;oon after we di&s;covered &s;ome low land, which appeared like an i&s;land, bearing S. &frac12; W. We continued our cour&s;e to the W. by S. and in two hours we &s;aw high land over the low land, extending to the &s;outhward as far as S. W. by S.; but it did not appear to be joined to the land to the northward, &s;o that there is either water, a deep bay, or low land between them.</P>
<P>At noon on the 6th, we were nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation as at noon on the day before: in the afternoon we found the va|riation by &s;everal azimuths and the amplitude, to be 15:10 E. On the 7th at noon, we were in latitude 47:6 S. and had made twelve miles ea&s;ting during the la&s;t twenty-four hours. We &s;tood to the we&s;tward the remainder of this day, and all the next till &s;un-&s;et, when the extremes of the land bore from N. by E. to W. di&s;tant about &s;even or eight leagues: in this &s;itua|tion our depth of water was fifty-five fathom, and the variation by amplitude 16:29 E. The wind now veered from the N. to the W. and as we had fine weather, and moonlight, we kept &s;tanding clo&s;e upon the wind to the S. W. all night. At four in the morning, we had &s;ixty fathom water; and at day|light, we di&s;covered under our bow a ledge of rocks, extend|ing from S. by W. to W. by S. upon which the &s;ea broke very high: they were not more than three quarters of a mile di&s;tant, yet we had five and forty fathom water. As the Wind was at N. W. we could not now weather them, and as I was unwil|ling to run to leeward, I tacked and made a trip to the ea&s;t|ward; the wind however &s;oon after coming to the northward, enabled us to get clear of all. Our &s;oundings, while we were pa&s;&s;ing within the ledge, were from thirty-five to forty-&s;even fathom, with a rocky bottom.</P>
<P>This ledge lies S. E. &s;ix leagues from the &s;outhermo&s;t part of the land, and S. E. by E. from &s;ome remarkable hills which &s;tand near the &s;hore: about three leagues to the north|ward of it, there is another ledge, which lies full three leagues from the &s;hore, and on which the &s;ea broke in a dreadful &s;urf. As we pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e rocks to the north in the night, and di&s;|covered the others under our bow at break of day, it is mani|fe&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="013324_0297_0F90F26D53AF3EE0">
that our danger was imminent, and our e&s;cape critical in the highe&s;t degree: from the &s;ituation of the&s;e rocks, &s;o well adapted to catch unwary &s;trangers, I called them the TRAPS. Our latitude at noon was 47:26 S. The Land in Sight, which had the appearance of an i&s;land, extended from N. E. by N. to N. W. by W. and &s;eemed to be about five leagues di&s;tant from the main; the ea&s;termo&s;t ledge of rocks bore S. S. E. di&s;tant one league and an half, and the northermo&s;t N. E. &frac12; E. di&s;|tant about three leagues. This land is high and barren, with nothing upon it but a few &s;traggling &s;hrubs, for not a &s;ingle tree was to be &s;een; it was however remarkable for a number of white patches, which I took to be marble, as they reflected the &s;un's rays very &s;trongly: other patches of the &s;ame kind we had ob&s;erved in different parts of this country, particularly in Mercury Bay: we continued to &s;tand clo&s;e upon a wind to the we&s;tward, and at &s;un-&s;et the &s;outhermo&s;t point of land bore N. 38 E. di&s;tant four leagues, and the we&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 2 E. The point which lies in latitude 47:19 S. lon|gitude 192:12 W. I named SOUTH-CAPE: the we&s;termo&s;t land was a &s;mall i&s;land, lying off the point of the main.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing South Cape to be the &s;outhern extremity of the country, as indeed it proved to be, I hoped to get round it by the we&s;t, for a large hollow &s;well from the &s;outh we&s;t, ever &s;ince our la&s;t hard gale, had convinced me that there was no land in that direction.</P>
<P>In the night we had a hard gale at N. E. by N. and N. which brought us under our cour&s;es, but about eight in the morning it became moderate; and at noon, veering to the we&s;t, we tacked and &s;tood to the northward, having no land in &s;ight. Our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 47:33 S. our longitude, we&s;t from the South Cape, 59. We &s;tood away N. N. E. clo&s;e upon a wind, without &s;eeing any land, till two the next morn|ing, when we di&s;covered an i&s;land bearing N. W. by N. di&s;|tant about five leagues: about two hours afterwards we &s;aw land a-head, upon which we tacked and &s;tood off till &s;ix, when we &s;tood in to take a nearer view of it: at eleven we were within three leagues of it, but the wind &s;eeming to incline upon the &s;hore, I tacked and &s;tood off to the &s;outhward. We had now &s;ailed round the land which we had di&s;covered on the 5th, and which then did not appear to be joined to the main, which lay north of it; and being now come to the other &s;ide of what we &s;uppo&s;ed to be water, a bay, or low land, it had the &s;ame appearance, but when I came to lay it down upon paper I &s;aw no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it to be an i&s;land; on the contrary, I was clearly of opinion that it made part of the main. At &s;oon, the we&s;tern extremity of the main bore N. 59 W. and the i&s;land which we had &s;een in the morning, S. 59 W. di&s;|tant about five leagues. It lies in latitude 46:31 S. longitude 192:49 W. and is nothing but a barren rock, about a mile in
<PB N="9" REF="013324_0298_0F90F26DF40B3E00">
circuit, remarkably high, and lies full five leagues di&s;tant from the main. This i&s;land I named after Dr. Solander, and called it SOLANDER's ISLAND. The &s;hore of the main lies neare&s;t E. by S. and W. by N. and forms a large open bay, in which there is no appearance of any harbour, or &s;helter for &s;hipping again&s;t S. W. and &s;outherly winds: the &s;urface of the country is broken into craggy hills, of a great height, on the &s;ummits of which are &s;everal patches of &s;now: it is not, however, wholly barren, for we could &s;ee wood not only in the vallies, but upon the highe&s;t ground, yet we &s;aw no appearance of its being in|habited.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand to the S. W. by S. till eleven o'clock the next morning, when the wind &s;hifted to the S. W. by W. upon which we wore, and &s;tood to the N. N. W. being then in latitude 47:40 S. longitude 193:50 W. and having a hollow &s;ea from the S. W.</P>
<P>During the night we &s;teered N. N. W. till &s;ix in the morn|ing, when, &s;eeing no land, we &s;teered N. by E. till eight, when we &s;teered N. E. by E. &frac12; E. to make the land, which at ten we &s;aw bearing E. N. E. but it being hazy, we could di&s;tingui&s;h nothing upon it. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;er|vation, was 46:S. About two it cleared up, and the land appeared to be high, rude, and mountainous: about half an hour after three I hauled in for a bay, in which there appeared to be good anchorage; but in about an hour, finding the di&s;|tance too great to run before it would be dark, and the wind blowing too hard to make the attempt &s;afe in the night, I bore away along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>This bay, which I called DUSKY BAY, lies in latitude 45 47 S.: it is between three and four miles broad at the en|trance, and &s;eems to be full as deep as it is broad: it contains &s;everal i&s;lands, behind which there mu&s;t be &s;helter from all winds, though po&s;&s;ibly there may not be &s;ufficient depth of wa|ter. The north point of this bay, when it bears S. E. by S. is rendered very remarkable by five high peaked rocks which lie off it, and have the appearance of four fingers and thumb of a man's hand, for which rea&s;on I called it POINT FIVE FINGERS: the land of this point is farther remarkable, for being the only level land within a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. It extends near two leagues to the northward, is lofty, and co|vered with wood: the land behind it is very different, con|&s;i&s;ting wholly of mountains, totally barren and rocky; and this difference gives the Cape the appearance of an i&s;land.</P>
<P>At &s;un-&s;et, the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore due &s;outh, di&s;tant about five or &s;ix leagues; and as this is the we&s;termo&s;t point of land upon the whole coa&s;t, I called it WEST CAPE. It lies about three leagues to the &s;outhward of Du&s;ky Bay, in the latitude of 45:54 S. and in longitude 193:17 W. The land of this Cape is of a moderate height next the &s;ea, and
<PB N="10" REF="013324_0299_0F90F26ECBFB69D0">
has nothing remarkable about it, except a very white cliff, two or three leagues to the &s;outhward of it: to the &s;outhward of it al&s;o the land trends away to the S. E. and to the north|ward it trends N. N. E.</P>
<P>Having brought to for the night, we made &s;ail along the &s;hore at four in the morning, in the direction of N. E. &frac12; N. with a moderate breeze at S. S. E. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 45:13 S. At this time, being about a league and an half from the &s;hore, we &s;ounded, but had no ground with &s;eventy fathom: we had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall nar|row opening in land, where there &s;eemed to be a very &s;afe and convenient harbour, formed by an i&s;land, which lay in the middle of the opening at ea&s;t. The opening lies in lat. 45:16 S. and on the land behind it are mountains, the &s;ummits of which were covered with &s;now, that appeared to have been recently fallen; and indeed for two days pa&s;t we had found the weather very cold. On each &s;ide the entrance of the opening, the land ri&s;es almo&s;t perpendicularly from the &s;ea to a &s;tupendous height, and this indeed was the rea&s;on why I did not carry the &s;hip in|to it, for no wind could blow there but right in, or right out, in the direction of either ea&s;t or we&s;t, and I thought it by no means advi&s;eable to put into a place whence I could not have got out but with a wind which experience had taught me did not blow more than one day in a month. In this, however, I acted contrary to the opinion of &s;ome per&s;ons on board, who, in very &s;trong terms, expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire to harbour for pre|&s;ent convenience, without any regard to future di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>In the evening, being about two leagues from the &s;hore, we &s;ounded, and had no ground with 108 fathom: the variation of the needle, by azimuth, was 14 E. and by amplitude 15 2. We made the be&s;t of our way along the &s;hore with what wind we had, keeping at the di&s;tance of between two and three leagues. At noon, we were in latitude 44:47, having run only twelve leagues upon a N. E. &frac14; N. cour&s;e, during the la&s;t four and twenty hours.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;teer along the &s;hore, in the direction of N. E. &frac14; E. till &s;ix o'clock in the evening, when we brought to for the night. As four in the morning, we &s;tood in for the land, and when the day broke we &s;aw what appeared to be an inlet; but upon a nearer approach proved to be only a deep valley between two high lands: we proceeded therefore in the &s;ame cour&s;e, keeping the &s;hore at the di&s;tance of be|tween four and five miles. At noon on the 16th, the nor|thermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight bore N. 60 E. at the di&s;tance of ten miles; and our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 44:5, our longitude from Cape We&s;t 2:8 E. About two, we pa&s;t the point which at noon had been di&s;tant ten miles, and found it to con&s;i&s;t of high red cliffs, down which there fell a ca&s;cade of water in four &s;mall &s;treams, and I therefore gave it the name
<PB N="11" REF="013324_0300_0F905037289396A8">
of CASCADE POINT. From this Point the land trends fir&s;t N. 76 E. and afterwards more to the northward. At the di&s;|tance of eight leagues from Ca&s;cade Point, in the direction of E. N. E. and at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore, lies a &s;mall low i&s;land, which bore from us S. by E. at the di&s;tance of about a league and a half.</P>
<P>At &s;even in the evening, we brought to, in thirty-three fathom, with a fine &s;andy bottom, at ten we had fifty fathom, and at twelve wore in &s;ixty-five fathom, having driven &s;everal miles N. N. W. after our having brought to. At two in the morning, we had no ground with 140 fathom; by which it appears that the &s;oundings extend but a little way from the &s;hore. About this time it fell calm; at eight a breeze &s;prung up at S. W. with which we &s;teered along the &s;hore, in the di|rection of N. E. by E. &frac12; E. at the di&s;tance of about three leagues. At &s;ix in the evening, being about one league from the &s;hore, we had &s;eventeen fathom; and at eight, being about three leagues from the &s;hore, we had forty-four: we now &s;hortened &s;ail and brought to, having run ten leagues N. E. by E. &s;ince noon.</P>
<P>It was calm mo&s;t part of the night; but at ten in the morn|ing a light breeze &s;prung up at S. W. by W. when we made &s;ail again along &s;hore, N. E. by N. having a large &s;well from the W. S. W. which had ri&s;en in the night; at noon, our la|titude, by ob&s;ervation, was 43:4 S. and our longitude from Cape We&s;t 4:12 E. We ob&s;erved, that the vallies as well as the mountains were this morning covered with &s;now, part of which we &s;uppo&s;ed to have fallen during the night, when we had rain. At &s;ix in the evening we &s;hortened &s;ail, and at ten brought to, at the di&s;tance of about five leagues from the &s;hore, where we had 115 fathom. At midnight there being little wind, we made &s;ail, and at eight in the morning we &s;tood to the N. E. clo&s;e upon a wind till noon, when we tack|ed, being about three leagues from the land, and, by ob&s;er|vation, in latitude 42:8, and longitude from Cape We&s;t 5:5 E.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand we&s;tward till two in the morning, when we made a trip to the ea&s;tward, and afterwards &s;tood we&s;t|ward till noon, when, by our reckoning, we were in the lati|tude of 42:23, and longitude from Cape We&s;t 3:55 E. We now tacked and &s;tood ea&s;tward, with a fre&s;h gale at N. by W. till &s;ix in the evening, when the wind &s;hifted to the S. and S. S. W. with which we &s;teered N. E. by N. till &s;ix in the morning, when we hauled in E. by N. to make the land, which we &s;aw &s;oon afterwards; at noon, our latitude, by ac|count was 41:37, and our longitude from Cape We&s;t 5:42 E. We were now within three or four leagues of the land, but it being foggy, we could &s;ee nothing upon it di&s;tinctly, and as
<PB N="12" REF="013324_0301_0F90F26F7B761F48">
we had much wind, and a va&s;t &s;well rolling in upon the &s;hore, from the W. S. W. I did not think it &s;afe to go nearer.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze from the S. S. W with which we &s;teered north along the &s;hore till eight, when, being within between two and three leagues, we &s;ounded, and had but thirty-four fathom; upon which we hauled off N. W. by N. till eleven at night, and then brought to, having &s;ix|ty-four fathom. At four in the morning we made &s;ail to the N. E. with a light breeze at S. S W. which at eight veered to the we&s;tward, and &s;oon after died away: at this time we were within three or four miles of the land, and had fifty-four fathom, with a large &s;well from the W. S. W. rolling oblique|ly upon the &s;hore, which made me fear that I &s;hould be oblig|ed to anchor; but by the help of a light air now and then from the S. W. I was able to keep the &s;hip from driving. At noon, the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. E. by E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant about ten leagues; our latitude, by account, was 40: 55 S. longitude from Cape We&s;t 6:35 E. From this time we had light airs from the &s;outhward, with intervals of calm, till noon on the 23d, when our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 40:36:30 S. and our longitude from Cape We&s;t 6:52 E. The ea&s;termo&s;t point of land in &s;ight bore E. 10 N. at the di&s;tance of &s;even leagues, and a bluff head or point, of which we had been abrea&s;t at noon the day before, and off which lay &s;ome rocks above water, bore S. 18 W. at the di&s;tance of &s;ix leagues. This point I called ROCK's POINT. Our latitude was now 40:55 S. and having nearly run down the whole of the north we&s;t coa&s;t of Tovy Poenammoo, I &s;hall give &s;ome ac|count of the face of the country.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that on the 11th, when we were off the &s;outhern part, the land then &s;een was craggy and moun|tainous, and there is great rea&s;on to believe that the &s;ame ridge of mountains extends nearly the whole length of the i&s;land. Between the we&s;termo&s;t land, which we &s;aw that day, and the ea&s;termo&s;t which we &s;aw on the 13th, there is a &s;pace of about &s;ix or eight leagues, of which we did not &s;ee the coa&s;t, though we plainly di&s;covered the mountains in-land. The &s;ea coa&s;t near Cape We&s;t is low, ri&s;ing with an ea&s;y and gradual a&s;cent to the foot of the mountains, and being in mo&s;t parts covered with wood. From Point Five Fingers, down to latitude 44:20, there is a narrow ridge of hills that ri&s;es directly from the &s;ea, and is covered with wood: clo&s;e behind the&s;e hills are the mountains, extending in another ridge of a &s;tupenduous height, and con&s;i&s;ting of rocks that are totally barren and naked, ex|cept where they are covered with &s;now, which is to be &s;een in large patches upon many parts of them, and has probably lain there ever &s;ince the creation of the world: a pro&s;pect more rude, craggy, and de&s;olate than this country affords from the &s;ea, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be conceived, for as far inland as the
<PB N="13" REF="013324_0302_0F90EC9BB4D63EC0">
eye can reach, nothing appears but the &s;ummits of rocks, which &s;tand &s;o near together, that in&s;tead of Vallies there are only fi&s;&s;ures between them. From the latitude of 44:20, to the latitude of 42:8, the&s;e mountains lie farther inland, and the &s;ea coa&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of woody hills and vallies, of various height and extent, and has much appearance of fertility: many of the vallies form plains of con&s;iderable extent, wholly covered with wood, but it is very probable that the ground, in many places, is &s;wampy and inter&s;per&s;ed with pools of water. From lati|tude 42:8, to 41:30, the land is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any thing remarkable: it ri&s;es into hills directly from the &s;ea, and is covered with wood; but the weather being foggy while we were upon this Part of the coa&s;t, we could &s;ee very little in|land, except now and then the &s;ummits of the mountains, tow|ing above the cloudy mi&s;ts that ob&s;cured them below, which confirmed my opinion that a chain of mountains extended from one end of the i&s;land to the other.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we had a gentle breeze at S. W. which, before it was quite dark, brought us abrea&s;t of the ea&s;tern point, which we had &s;een at noon; but not knowing what cour&s;e the land took on the other &s;ide of it, we brought to in thirty-four fathom, at the di&s;tance of about one league from the &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re. At eight in the evening, there being little wind, we filled and &s;tood on till midnight, and then we brought to till four in the morning, when we again made &s;ail, and at break of day we &s;aw low land extending from the point to the S. S. E. as far as the eye could reach, the ea&s;tern extremi|ty of which appeared in round hillocks: by this time the gale had veered to the ea&s;tward, which obliged us to ply to wind|ward. At noon, next day, the ea&s;tern point bore S. W. by S. di&s;tant &s;ixteen miles, and our latitude was 40:19: the wind continuing ea&s;terly, we were nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation at noon on the day following. About 3 o'clock the wind came to the we&s;tward, and we &s;teered E. S. E. with all the &s;ail we could &s;et till it was dark, and then &s;hortened &s;ail till the morning: as we had thick hazey weather all night, we kept &s;ounding continually, and had from thirty-&s;even to forty-two fathom. When the day broke we &s;aw land bearing S. E. by E. and an i&s;land lying near it, bearing E. S. E. di&s;tant about five leagues: this i&s;land I knew to be the &s;ame that I had &s;een from the entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound, from which it bears N. W. by N. di&s;tant nine leagues. At noon, it bore &s;outh, di&s;tant four or five miles, and the north we&s;t head of the Sound S. E. by S. di&s;tant ten leagues and an half. Our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 40:33 S.</P>
<P>As we had now circumnavigated the whole country, it be|came nece&s;&s;ary to think of quitting it; but as I had thirty tons of empty water ca&s;ks on board, this could not be done till I
<PB N="14" REF="013324_0303_0F90F27040590CE0">
had filled them: I therefore hauled round the i&s;land, and en|tered a bay, which lies between that and Queen Charlotte's Sound, leaving three more i&s;lands, which lay clo&s;e under the we&s;tern &s;hore, between 3 and 4 miles within the entrance, on our &s;tarboard hand: while we were running in, we kept the lead continually going, and had from forty to twelve fathom. At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, we anchored in eleven fathom with a muddy bottom, under the we&s;t &s;hore, in the &s;econd cove, that lies within the three i&s;lands; and as &s;oon as it was light the next morning, I took a boat, and went on &s;hore to look for a watering place, and a proper birth for the &s;hip, both which I found, much to my &s;atisfaction. As &s;oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;hip was moored I &s;ent an officer on &s;hore to &s;uperintend the water|ing, and the carpenter, with his crew, to cut wood, while the long-boat was employed in landing the empty ca&s;ks.</P>
<P>In this employment we were bu&s;y till the 30th, when the wind &s;eeming to &s;ettle at S. E. and our water being nearly completed, we warped the &s;hip out of the cove, that we might have room to get under &s;ail: and at noon I went away in the pinnace to examine as much of the bay as my time would admit.</P>
<P>After rowing about two leagues up it, I went a&s;hore upon a point of land on the we&s;tern &s;ide, and having climbed a hill, I &s;aw the we&s;tern arm of this bay run in S. W. by W. about five leagues farther, yet I could not di&s;cover the end of it: there appeared to be &s;everal other inlets, or at lea&s;t &s;mall bays, between this and the north we&s;t head of Queen Char|lotte's Sound, in each of which, I make no doubt, there is anchorage and &s;helter, as they are all covered from the &s;ea wind by the i&s;lands which lie without them. The land about this bay, as far as I could &s;ee of it, is of a hilly &s;urface, chiefly covered with trees, &s;hrubs, and fern, which render travelling difficult and fatiguing. In this Excur&s;ion I was accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who found &s;everal new plants. We met with &s;ome hutts, which &s;eemed to have been long de|&s;erted, but &s;aw no inhabitants. Mr. Banks examined &s;everal of the &s;tones that lay upon the beach, which were full of veins, and had a mineral appearance; but he did not di&s;cover any thing in them which he knew to be ore; if he had an opportunity to examine any of the bare rocks, perhaps he might have been more fortunate. He was al&s;o of opinion that what I had taken for marble in another place, was a mineral &s;ub&s;tance; and that, con&s;idering the corre&s;pondence of latitude between this place and South-America, it was not improbable but that, by a pro|per examination, &s;omething very valuable might be found.</P>
<P>At my return in the evening, I found all the wood and wa|ter on board, and the &s;hip ready for the &s;ea; I re&s;olved therefore to quit the country, and return home by &s;uch a

route as might be of mo&s;t advantage to the &s;ervice; and upon this &s;ubject took the opinion of my officers. I had my&s;elf a &s;trong de&s;ire to return by Cape Horn, becau&s;e that would have enabled me finally to determine, whether there is or not a &s;outhern continent; but again&s;t this it was a &s;ufficient objec|tion that we mu&s;t have kept in a high &s;outhern latitude, in the very depth of winter, with a ve&s;&s;el which was not thought &s;uf|ficient for the undertaking: and the &s;ame rea&s;on was urged again&s;t our proceeding directly for the Cape of Good Hope, with &s;till more force, becau&s;e no di&s;covery of moment could be hoped for in that rout; it was therefore re&s;olved that we &s;hould return by the Ea&s;t-Indies, and that with this view we &s;hould, upon leaving the coa&s;t, &s;teer we&s;tward, till we &s;hould fall in with the ea&s;t coa&s;t of New-Holland, and then follow the direction of that coa&s;t to the northward, till we &s;hould ar|rive at its northern extremity; but if that &s;hould be found im|practicable, it was further re&s;olved that we &s;hould endeavour to fall in with the land, or i&s;lands, &s;aid to have been di&s;cover|ed by Quiros.</P>
<P>With this view, at break of day on Saturday the 31&s;t of March 1770, we got under &s;ail, and put to &s;ea, with the ad|vantage of a fre&s;h gale at S. E. and clear weather, taking our departure from the ea&s;tern point, which we had &s;een at noon on the 23, and to which, on this occa&s;ion, I gave the name of CAPE FAREWELL.</P>
<P>The bay out of which we had ju&s;t &s;ailed I called ADMI|RALTY BAY, giving the name of CAPE STEPHENS to the north we&s;t point, and of CAPE JACKSON to the &s;outh ea&s;t, after the two gentlemen who at this time were Secretaries to the Board.</P>
<P>Admiralty Bay may be ea&s;ily known by the i&s;land that has been ju&s;t mentioned, which lies two miles N. E. of Cape Ste|phens, in latitude 40:37 S. longitude, 185:6 W. and is of a con&s;iderable height. Between this i&s;land and Cape Fare|well, which are between fourteen and fifteen leagues di&s;tant from each other, in the direction of W. by N. and E. by S. the &s;hore forms a large deep bay, the bottom of which we could &s;carcely &s;ee while we were &s;ailing in a &s;trait line from one cape to the other; it is, however, probable of le&s;s depth than it ap|peared to be, for as we found the water &s;hallower here, than at the di&s;tance from any other part of the coa&s;t, there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the land at the bottom which lies next the &s;ea is low, and therefore not ea&s;ily to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from it. I have for this rea&s;on called it BLIND BAY, and am of opinion that it is the &s;ame which was called Murderer's Bay by Ta&s;man.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. A general Account of New Zealand: its fir&s;t di&s;covery, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NEW ZEALAND was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Abel Jan|&s;en Ta&s;man, a Dutch Navigator, who&s;e name has been &s;everal times mentioned in this narrative, on the 13th of De|cember, in the year 1642. He traver&s;ed the ea&s;tern coa&s;t from latitude 34 to 43, and entered the &s;treight which divides the two i&s;lands, and in the chart is called COOK's STREIGHT: but being attacked by the natives &s;oon after he came to an anchor, in the place to which he gave the name of Murderer's Bay, he never went on &s;hore. He gave the country the name of STAATEN-ISLAND, or the land of the States, in honour of the States-General, and it is now generally di&s;tingui&s;hed in our maps and charts by the name of NEW ZEALAND. As the whole of this country, except that part of the coa&s;t which was &s;een by Ta&s;man from on board his &s;hip, has from his time, to the voyage of the Endeavour, remained altogether un|known, it has by many been &s;uppo&s;ed to be part of a &s;outhern continent. It is however now known to con&s;i&s;t of two large i&s;lands, divided from each other by a &s;treight or pa&s;&s;age, which is about four or five leagues broad.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands are &s;ituated between the latitudes of 34 and 48 S. and between the longitude of 181 and 194 W. which is now determined with uncommon exactne&s;s, from innumerable ob&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, and one of the tran&s;its of Mercury, by Mr. Green, a per&s;on of known abilities, who, as has been ob&s;erved before, was &s;ent out by the Royal Socie|ty, to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of Venus in the South Seas.</P>
<P>The northermo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands is called by the natives Eaheinomauwe, and the &s;outhermo&s;t Tovy, or Tavai Poe|nammoo; yet, as I have ob&s;erved before, we are not &s;ure whether the name of Tovy Poenammoo comprehends the whole &s;outhern i&s;land, or only part of it. The figure and extent of the&s;e i&s;lands, with the &s;ituation of the bays and har|bours they contain, and the &s;maller i&s;lands that lie about them, will appear from the chart that I have drawn, every part of which, however, I cannot vouch to be equally accurate. The coa&s;t of Eaheinomauwe, from Cape Palli&s;er to Ea&s;t Cape, is laid down with great exactne&s;s, both in its figure, and the cour&s;e and di&s;tance from point to point; for the opportunities that offered, and the methods that I u&s;ed, were &s;uch as could &s;carcely admit of an error. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m Ea&s;t Cape to St. Maria van Diemen, the chart, tho' perhaps not equally exact, is without any error of moment, except po&s;&s;ibly in &s;ome few places which are here, and in other parts of the chart, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a
<PB N="17" REF="013324_0306_0F90EC9C6E35C9C8">
dotted line, and which I had no opportunity to examine: from Cape Maria van Diemen to latitude 36:15, we were &s;eldom nearer the &s;hore than between five and eight leagues; and therefore the line that marks the &s;ea coa&s;t may po&s;&s;ibly be er|roneous. From latitude 36:15, to nearly the length of En|try I&s;land, our cour&s;e was very near the &s;hore, and in this part of the chart, therefore, there can be no material error, except, pethaps, at Cape Tierawitte. Between Entry I&s;land and Cape Palli&s;er we were again farther from the &s;hore, and this part of the coa&s;t therefore may not be laid down with minute exact|ne&s;s: yet, upon the whole, I am of opinion that this i&s;land will be found not much to differ from the figure that I have given it, and that upon the coa&s;t there are few or no harbours which are not noticed in the journal or delineated in the chart. I cannot however &s;ay as much of Tovy Poenammoo, the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the circum&s;tances of the voyage, would not permit me to &s;pend &s;o much time about this i&s;land as I had employed upon the other; and the &s;torms that we met with made it both difficult and dangerous to keep near the &s;hore. However, from Queen Charlotte's Sound to Cape Campbel, and as far to the S. W. as latitude 43, the chart will be found pretty accurate. Between latitude 43, and latitude 44<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">:20 the line may be doubted, for of &s;ome part of the coa&s;t which it repre&s;ents, we had &s;carcely a view. From latitude 44:20, to Cape Saunders, our di&s;tance would not permit me to be parti|cular, and the weather was be&s;ides extremely unfavourable. From Cape Saunders to Cape South, and even to Cape We&s;t, there is al&s;o rea&s;on to fear that the chart will in many places be fouod erroneous, as we were &s;eldom able to keep the &s;hore, and were &s;ometimes blown to &s;uch a di&s;tance that it could not be &s;een. From Cape We&s;t to Cape Farewell, and even to Charlotte's Sound, it is not more to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>Tovy Poenammoo is for the mo&s;t part a mountainous, and to all appearance a barren country; and the people whom we &s;aw in Queen Charlotte's Sound, tho&s;e that came off to us un|der the &s;nowy mountains, and the fires to the we&s;t of Cape Saunders, were all the inhabitants, and &s;igns of inhabitants, that we di&s;covered upon the whole i&s;land.</P>
<P>Eaheinomauwe has much better appearance; it is indeed not only hilly but mountainous, yet even the hills and mountains are covered with wood, and every valley has a rivulet of water: the &s;oil in the&s;e vallies, and in the plains, of which there are many that are not overgrown with wood, is in general light but fertile, and in the opinion of Mr. Banks and Dr. Salan|der, as well as of every other gentleman on board, every kind of European grain, plants, and fruit, would flouri&s;h here in the utmo&s;t luxuriance: from the vegetables that we found here, there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the winters are milder than
<PB N="18" REF="013324_0307_0F90F27343B26558">
tho&s;e in England, and we found the &s;ummer not hotter, tho' it was more equally warm; &s;o that if this country &s;hould be &s;ettled by people from Europe, they would, with a little in|du&s;try, be very &s;oon &s;upplied not only with the nece&s;&s;aries, but luxurious of life in great abundance.</P>
<P>In this country there are no quadrupeds but dogs and rats, at lea&s;t we &s;aw no other, and the rats are &s;o &s;carce that many of us never &s;aw them. The dogs live with the people, who breed them for no other purpo&s;e than to eat: there might in|deed be quadrupeds that we did not &s;ee, but this is not pro|bable, becau&s;e the chief pride of the natives, with re&s;pect to their dre&s;s, is in the &s;kins and hair of &s;uch animals as they have, and we never &s;aw the &s;kins of any animal about them but tho&s;e of dogs and birds: there are indeed &s;eals upon the coa&s;t, and we once &s;aw a &s;ea lion; but we imagine they are &s;eldom caught, for though we &s;aw &s;ome of their teeth, which were fa&s;hioned into an Ornament like a bodkin, and worn by the natives at their brea&s;t, and highly valued, we &s;aw none of their &s;kins: there are whales al&s;o upon this coa&s;t, and though the people did not appear to have any art or in&s;trument by which &s;uch an animal could be taken and killed, we &s;aw pat|too-pattoos in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of them, which were made of the bone of a whale, or of &s;ome other animal who&s;e bone had exactly the &s;ame appearance.</P>
<P>Of birds the &s;pecies are not many; and of the&s;e none, ex|cept perhaps the gannet, is the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Europe: here are ducks indeed, and &s;haggs of &s;everal kinds, &s;ufficient|ly re&s;embling tho&s;e of Europe, to be called the &s;ame, by tho&s;e who have not examined them very nicely. Here are al&s;o hawks, owls, and quails, which differ but little from tho&s;e of Europe at fir&s;t &s;ight; and &s;everal &s;mall birds, who&s;e &s;ong, as has been remarked in the cour&s;e of the narrative, is much more melodious than any that we had ever heard.</P>
<P>The &s;ea coa&s;t is al&s;o vi&s;ited by many oceanic birds, parti|cularly albatro&s;&s;es, &s;heerwaters, pintados, and a few of the birds, which Sir John Narborough has called Penguins, and which indeed are what the French call <HI>Nuance,</HI> and &s;eem to be a middle &s;pecies between bird and fi&s;h; for their feathers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e upon their wings, differ very little from &s;cales; and their wings them&s;elves, which they u&s;e only in diving, and not to accelerate their motion even upon the &s;urface of the water, may, perhaps, with equal propriety, be called fins.</P>
<P>Neither are in&s;ects in greater plenty than birds: a few but|terflies and beetles, fle&s;h flies, very like tho&s;e in Europe, and &s;ome mu&s;quitos and &s;and-flies, perhaps exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of North-America, make up the whole catalogue. Of mu&s;quitos and &s;and flies, however, which are ju&s;tly accounted the cur&s;e of every country where they abound, we did not &s;ee many; there were indeed a few in almo&s;t every place where
<PB N="19" REF="013324_0308_0F90F273F964B020">
we went on &s;hore, but they gave us &s;o little trouble, that we did not make u&s;e of the &s;hades which we had provided for the &s;ecurity of our faces.</P>
<P>For this &s;carcity of animals upon the land, the &s;ea, how|ever, makes an abundant recompen&s;e; every creek &s;warming with fi&s;h, which are not only whole&s;ome, but equally deli|cious with tho&s;e of Europe: the &s;hip &s;eldom anchored in any &s;tation, or with a light gale pa&s;&s;ed any place, that did not afford us enough with hook and line to &s;erve the whole &s;hip's company, e&s;pecially to the &s;outhward: when we lay at an|chor, the boats, with hook and line, near the rocks, could take fi&s;h in any quantity; and the &s;eine &s;eldom failed of pro|ducing a &s;till more ample &s;upply; &s;o that both times when we anchored in Cook's Streight, every me&s;s in the &s;hip, that was not carele&s;s and improvident, &s;alted as much as la&s;ted many weeks a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter they went to &s;ea. Of this article, the variety was equal to the plenty; we had mackrel of many kinds, among which one was exactly the &s;ame as we have in England: the&s;e came in immen&s;e &s;hoals, and were taken by the natives in their &s;eines, who &s;old them to us at a very ea&s;y rate. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were fi&s;h of many &s;pecies which we had never &s;een before, but to all which the &s;eamen very readily gave names; &s;o that we talked here as familiarly of hakes, bream, cole-fi&s;h, and many others, as we do in England; and though they are by no means of the &s;ame family, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that they do honour to the name. But the highe&s;t luxury which the &s;ea afforded us, even in this place, was the lob&s;ter or &s;ea cray-fi&s;h, which are probably the &s;ame that in the account of Lord An&s;on's voyage are &s;aid to have been found at the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes, except that, although large, they are not quite equal in &s;ize: they differ from ours in England in &s;everal parti|culars, they have a greater number of prickles on their backs, and they are red when fir&s;t taken out of the water. The&s;e we al&s;o bought every where to the northward in great quantities of the natives, who catch them by diving near the &s;hore, and finding out where they lie with their feet. We had al&s;o a fi&s;h that Frezier, in his voyage to the Spani&s;h Main in South-America, has de&s;cribed by the names <HI>Elefant, Pejegallo,</HI> or <HI>Poi&s;on coq,</HI> which, though cour&s;e, we eat very heartily. Seve|ral &s;pecies of the &s;kate, or &s;ting-ray, are al&s;o found here, which were &s;till coar&s;er than the Elefant; but as an atone|ment, we had among many kind of dog-fi&s;h one, &s;potted with white, which was in flavour exactly &s;imilar to our be&s;t &s;kate, but much more delicious. We had al&s;o a flat fi&s;h re&s;embling both &s;oles and flounders, be&s;ides eels and congers of various kinds, with many others of which tho&s;e who &s;hall hereafter vi|&s;it this coa&s;t will not fail to find the advantage; and &s;hell-fi&s;h in great variety, particularly clams, cockles, and oy&s;ters.</P>

Among the vegetable productions of this country, the trees claim a principal place; for here are forre&s;ts of va&s;t extent, full of the &s;traite&s;t, the cleane&s;t, and the large&s;t timber trees that we had ever &s;een; their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> grain, and apparent dura|bility, render them fit for any kind of building, and indeed for every other purpo&s;e except mu&s;ts; for which, as I have al|ready ob&s;erved, they are too hard, and too heavy: there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> one in particular which, when we, were upon the coa&s;t, was rendered con&s;picuous by a &s;carlet flower, that &s;eemed to be a compendage of many fibres; it is about as large as an oak, and the wood is exceedingly hard and heavy, and excellently adapted to the u&s;e of the mill-wright. There is another which grows in the &s;wamps, remarkably tall and &s;trait, thick enough to make ma&s;ts for ve&s;&s;els of any &s;ize, and, if a judgment may be formed by the direction of its grain, very tough: this, which, as has been before remarked, our carpenter thought to re&s;emble the pitch-pine, may probably be lightened by tap|ping, and it will then make the fine&s;t ma&s;ts in the world: it has a leaf not unlike a yew, and bears berries in &s;mall bunches.</P>
<P>Great part of the country is covered with a luxuriant ver|dure, and our natural hi&s;torians were gratified by the novelty, if not the variety of the plants. Sow-thi&s;tle, garden night-&s;hade, one or two kinds of gra&s;s, the &s;ame as in England, and two or three kinds of fern, like tho&s;e of the We&s;t Indies, with a few of the plants that are to be found in almo&s;t every part of the world, were all, out of about four hundred &s;pecies, that have hitherto been de&s;cribed by any botani&s;ts, or had been &s;een el&s;ewhere during the cour&s;e of this voyage, except about five or &s;ix which had been gathered at Terra del Fuego.</P>
<P>Of eatable vegetables there are but few; our people indeed, who had been long at &s;ea, eat, with equal plea&s;ure and ad|vantage, of wild celery, and a kind of cre&s;&s;es, which grew in great abundance upon all parts of the &s;ea-&s;hore. We al&s;o, once or twice, met with a plant like what the country people in England call <HI>Lamb's quarters,</HI> or Fat-hen, which we boiled in&s;tead of greens; and once we had the good fortune to find a cabbage tree, which afforded us a delicious meal; and, ex|cept the fern-root, and one other vegetable, totally unknown in Europe, and which, though eaten by the natives, was ex|tremely di&s;agreeable to us, we found no other vegetable pro|duction that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it for food, among tho&s;e that appeared to be the wild produce of the country; and we could find but three e&s;culent plants among tho&s;e which are rai&s;ed by cultivation, yams, &s;weet potatoes, and coccos. Of the yams and potatoes there are plantations con&s;i&s;ting of many acres, and I believe that any &s;hip which &s;hould happen to be here in the autumn, when they are dug up, might purcha&s;e them in any quantity.</P>
<P>Gourds are al&s;o cultivated by the natives of this place, the
<PB N="21" REF="013324_0310_0F90F2758781B8F0">
fruit of which furni&s;hes them with ve&s;&s;els for various u&s;es. We al&s;o found here the Chine&s;e paper mulberry tree, the &s;ame as that which the inhabitants of the South Sea i&s;lands make their cloth; but it is &s;o &s;carce, that though the New Zealanders al&s;o make cloth of it, they have not enough for any other pur|po&s;e than to wear as an ornament in the holes which they make in their ears, as I have ob&s;erved before.</P>
<P>But among all the trees, &s;hrubs, and plants of this country, there is not one that produces fruit, except a berry which has neither &s;weetne&s;s nor flavour, and which none but the boys took the pains to gather, &s;hould be honoured with that appellation. There is, however, a plant that &s;erves the inha|bitants in&s;tead of hemp and flax, which excels all that are put to the &s;ame purpo&s;es in other countries. Of this plant there are two &s;orts; the leaves of both re&s;emble tho&s;e of flags, but the flowers are &s;maller, and their clu&s;ters more numerous; in one kind they are yellow, and in the other a deep red. Of the leaves of the&s;e plants, with very little preparation, they make all their common apparel; and of the&s;e they make al&s;o their &s;trings, lines, and cordage for every purpo&s;e, which are &s;o much &s;tronger than any thing we can make with hemp, that they will not bear a compari&s;on. From the &s;ame plant, by another preparation, they draw long &s;lender fibres, which &s;hine like &s;ilk, and are as white as &s;now: of the&s;e, which are al&s;o &s;urprizingly &s;trong, the finer clothes are made; and of the leaves, without any other preparation than &s;plitting them into proper breadths, and tying the &s;trips together, they make their fi&s;hing nets; &s;ome of which, as I have before remarked, are of an enormous &s;ize.</P>
<P>A plant, which with &s;uch advantage might be applied to &s;o many u&s;eful and important purpo&s;es, would certainly be a great acqui&s;ition to England, where it would probably thrive with very little trouble, as it &s;eems to be hardy, and to affect no particular &s;oil; being found equally in hill and valley, in the drie&s;t mould, and the deepe&s;t bogs: the bog, however, it &s;eems rather to prefer, as near &s;uch places we ob&s;erved it to be larger than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that we found great plenty of iron &s;and in Mercury Bay, and therefore that iron ore is undoub|tedly to be found at no great di&s;tance. As to other metals we had &s;carcely knowledge enough of the country for conjecture.</P>
<P>If the &s;ettling of this country &s;hould ever be thought an ob|ject worthy the attention of Great Britain, the be&s;t place for e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony would be either on the banks of the Thames, or in the country bordering upon the Bay of I&s;lands. In either place there would be the advantage of an excellent harbour; and, by means of the river, &s;ettlements might be extended, and a communication e&s;tabli&s;hed with the inland
<PB N="22" REF="013324_0311_0F90F27640287B48">
parts of the country, ve&s;&s;els might be built of the fine timber which abounds in the&s;e parts, at very little trouble and ex|pence, fit for &s;uch a navigation as would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. I cannot indeed exactly a&s;&s;ign the depth of water which a ve&s;|&s;el intended to navigate this river, even as far up as I went wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h the boat, &s;hould draw, becau&s;e this depends upon the depth of water that is upon the bar, or flats, which lie before the narrow part of the river, for I had no opportunity to make my&s;elf acquainted with them; but I am of opinion, that a ve&s;|&s;el which &s;hould draw not more than twelve feet would perfect|ly an&s;wer the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When we fir&s;t arrived upon the coa&s;t of this country, we imagined it to be much better peopled than we afterwards found it, concluding that the inland parts were populous from the &s;moke that we &s;aw at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore; and perhaps that may really be the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the country behind Poverty Bay, and the Bay of Plenty, where the inhabitants appeared to be more numerous than in other places. But we had rea&s;on to believe, that, in general, no part of country bnt the &s;ea coa&s;t is inhabited; and even there we found the people but thinly &s;cattered, all the we&s;tern coa&s;t from Cape Maria Van Diemen to Mount Egmont being totally de&s;olate; &s;o that upon the whole the number of inhabitants bears no pro|portion to the extent of country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A de&s;cription of the inhabitants, their habitations, apparel, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tature of the men in general is equal to the large&s;t of tho&s;e in Europe: they are &s;tout, well limbed, and fle&s;hy; but not fat, like the lazy and luxurious inhabitants of the i&s;lands in the South Seas: they are al&s;o exceedingly vigorous and ac|tive; and have an adroitne&s;s, and manual dexterity in an un|common degree, which are di&s;covered in whatever they do. I have &s;een the &s;trokes of fifteen paddles on a &s;ide, in one of their canoes made with incredible quickne&s;s, and yet with &s;uch mi|nute exactne&s;s of time, that all the rowers &s;eemed to be actuat|ed by one common &s;oul. Their colour in general is brown; but in few deeper than that of a Spaniard, who has been ex|po&s;ed to the &s;un; in many not &s;o deep. The women have not a feminine delicacy in their appearance, but their voice is remarkably &s;oft; and by that, the dre&s;s of both &s;exes being the &s;ame, they are principally di&s;tingui&s;hed: they have, how|ever, like women of other countries, more airy cheerfulne&s;s, and a greater flow of animal &s;pirits, than the other &s;ex. Their hair, both of the head and beard, is black; and their teeth extremely regular, and as white as ivory: the features of both

&s;exes are good; they &s;eem to enjoy high health, and we &s;aw many who appeared to be of a great age. The di&s;po&s;itions both of the men and women &s;eemed to be mild and gentle; they treat each other with the tendere&s;t affection, but are im|placable towards their enemies, to whom, as I have before ob|&s;erved, they never give quarter. It may perhaps, at fir&s;t, &s;eem &s;trange, that where there is &s;o little to be got by victory, there &s;hould &s;o often be war; and that every little di&s;trict of a country inhabited by people &s;o mild and placid, &s;hould be at enmity with all the re&s;t. But po&s;&s;ibly more is to be gained by victo|ry among the&s;e people than at fir&s;t appears, and they may be prompted to mutual ho&s;tilities by motives which no degree of friend&s;hip or affection is able to re&s;i&s;t. It appears, by the ac|count that has already been given of them, that their princi|pal food is fi&s;h, which can only be procured upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t; and there, in &s;ufficient quantities, only at certain times: the tribes, therefore, who live inland, if any &s;uch there are, and even tho&s;e upon the coa&s;t, mu&s;t be frequently in danger of pe|ri&s;hing by famine. Their country produces neither &s;heep, nor goats, nor hogs, nor cattle; tame fowls they have none, nor any art by which tho&s;e that are wild can be caught in &s;uffici|ent plenty to &s;erve as provi&s;ion. If there are any who&s;e &s;itua|tion cuts them off from a &s;upply of fi&s;h, the only &s;uccedaneum of all other animal food, except dogs, they have nothing to &s;upport life, but the vegetables that have already been mention|ed, of which the chief are fern root, yams, clams, aod potatoes: when by any accident the&s;e fail, the di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t be dreadful; and even among the inhabitants of the coa&s;t, many tribes mu&s;t frequently be reduced to nearly the &s;ame &s;ituation, either by the failure of their plantations, or the deficiency of their dry &s;tock, during the &s;ea&s;on when but few fi&s;h are to be caught. The&s;e con&s;iderations will enable us to account, not only for the perpetual danger in which the people who inhabit this country appear to live, by the care which they take to fortify every village, but for the horrid practice of eating tho&s;e who are killed in battle; for the hunger of him who is pre&s;&s;ed by famine to fight, will ab&s;orb every feeling, and every &s;enti|ment which would re&s;train him from allaying it with the body of his adver&s;ary. It may however be remarked, that if this account of the origin of &s;o horrid a practice is true, the mi&s;|chief does by no means end with the nece&s;&s;ity that produced it: after the practice has been once begun on one &s;ide by hun|ger, it will naturally be adopted on the other by revenge. Nor is this all, for though it may be pretended, by &s;ome who wi&s;h to appear &s;peculative and philo&s;ophical, that whether the dead body of an enemy be eaten or buried, is in it&s;elf a mat|ter perfectly indifferent; as it is, whether the brea&s;ts and thighs of a woman &s;hould be covered or naked; and that prejudice
<PB N="24" REF="013324_0313_0F90503805CA0288">
and habit only make us &s;hudder at the violation of cu&s;tom in one in&s;tance, and blu&s;h at it in the other: yet, leaving this as a point of doubtful di&s;putation, to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at lei&s;ure, it may &s;afely be affirmed, that the practice of eating human fle&s;h, whatever it may be in it&s;elf, is relatively, and in its con&s;e|quences, mo&s;t pernicious; tending manife&s;tly to eradicate a principle which is the chief &s;ecurity of human life, and more frequently re&s;trains the hand of murder than the &s;en&s;e of duty, or even the fear of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to eat the dead, death mu&s;t have lo&s;t much of its horror; and where there is little horror at the &s;ight of death, there will not be much repug|nance to kill. A &s;en&s;e of duty, and fear of puni&s;hment, may be more ea&s;ily &s;urmounted than the feelings of nature, or tho&s;e which have been engrafted upon nature by early prejudice and uninterrupted cu&s;tom. The horror of the murderer ari&s;es le&s;s from the guilt of the fact, than its natural effect; and he who has familiari&s;ed the effect, will con&s;equently loo&s;e much of the horror. By our laws, and our religion, murder and theft in|cur the &s;ame puni&s;hment, both in this world and the next; yet, of the multitude who would deliberately &s;teal, there are but very few who would deliberately kill, even to procure much greater advantage. But there is the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that tho&s;e who have been &s;o accu&s;tomed to prepare a human body for a meal, that they can with as little feeling cut up a dead man, as our cook-maids divide a dead rabit for a fri|ca&s;&s;ee, would feel as little horror in committing a murder, as in picking a pocket, and con&s;equently would take away life with as little compunction as property; &s;o that men, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, would be made murderers by the &s;light temptations that now make them thieves. If any man doubts whether this rea&s;on is conclu&s;ive, let him a&s;k him&s;elf, whether in his own opinion he &s;hould not be &s;afer with a man in whom the horror of de&s;troying life is &s;trong, whether in con&s;equence of natural in&s;tinct un&s;ubdued, or of early prejudice, which has nearly an equal influence; than in the power of a man who under any temptation to murder him would be re&s;trained only by con&s;iderations of intere&s;t; for to the&s;e all motives of mere duty may be reduced, as they mu&s;t terminate either in hope of good, or fear of evil.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, however, of the&s;e poor people, as well as their temper, are favourable to tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ettle as a colony among them. Their &s;ituation &s;ets them in need of protection, and their temper renders it ea&s;y to at|tach them by kindne&s;s; and whatever may be &s;aid in favour of a &s;avage life, among people who live in luxurious idlene&s;s upon the bounty of nature, civilization would certainly be a ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e whom her par&s;imony &s;carcely furni&s;hes with
<PB N="25" REF="013324_0314_0F90EC9DF1891F30">
the bread of life, and who are perpetually de&s;troying each other by violence, as the only alternative of peri&s;hing by hun|ger.</P>
<P>But the&s;e people, from whatever cau&s;e, being inured to war, and by habit con&s;idering every &s;tranger as an enemy, were al|ways di&s;po&s;ed to attack us when they were not intimidated by our manife&s;t &s;uperiority. At fir&s;t, they had no notion of any &s;uperiority but numbers; and when this was on their &s;ide, they con&s;idered all our expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s as the artifices of fear and cunning, to circumvent them, and pre&s;erve our&s;elves; but when they were once convinced of our power, after having pro|voked us to the u&s;e of our fire-arms, tho' loaded only with &s;mall &s;hot; and of our clemency by forbearing to make u&s;e of wea|pons &s;o dreadful, except in our defence; they became at once friendly, and even affectionate, placing in us the mo&s;t un|bounded confidence, and doing every thing which could incite us to put equal confidence in them. It is al&s;o remarkable, that when an intercour&s;e was once e&s;tabli&s;hed between us, they were very rarely detected in any act of di&s;hone&s;ty. Before, indeed, and while they con&s;idered us as enemies, who came upon their coa&s;t only to make an advantage of them, they did not &s;cruple by any means to make an advantage of us; and would, there|fore, when they had received the price of any thing they had offered to &s;ell, pack up both the purcha&s;e and purcha&s;e-money with all po&s;&s;ible compo&s;ure, as &s;o much lawful plunder from people who had no view but to plunder them.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved that our friends in the South Seas had not even the idea of indecency, with re&s;pect to any object or any action; but this was by no means the ca&s;e with the inhabitants of New Zealand, in who&s;e carriage and conver&s;ation there was as much mode&s;t re&s;erve and decorum with re&s;pect to actions, which yet in their opinion were not criminal, as are to be found among the polite&s;t people in Europe. The women were not impregnable; but the terms and manner of compliance were as decent as tho&s;e in marriage among us, and according to their notions, the agreement was as innocent. When any of our people made an overture to one of their young women, he was given to under&s;tand that the con&s;ent of her friends was nece&s;|&s;ary, and by the influence of a proper pre&s;ent, it was general|ly obtained; but when the&s;e preliminaries were &s;ettled, it was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to treat the wife for a night, with the &s;ame delicacy that is here required by the wife for life, and the lo|ver who pre&s;umed to take any liberties by which this was vio|lated, was &s;ure to be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>One of our gentlemen having made his addre&s;&s;es to a fami|ly of the better &s;ort, received an an&s;wer, which, tran&s;lated into our language, according to the mode and &s;pirit of it, as well as the letter, would have been exactly in the&s;e terms: <Q>Any

<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that in per&s;onal cleanline&s;s they are not quite equal to our friends at Otaheite, becau&s;e, not having the advantage of &s;o warm a climate, they do not &s;o o&s;ter go in|to the water; but the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful thing about them is the oil, with which, like the i&s;landers, they anoint their hair: it is certainly the fat either of fi&s;h or birds, melted down, and though the better &s;ort have it fre&s;h, their inferiors u&s;e that which is rancid, and con&s;equently are almo&s;t as di&s;agreeable to the &s;mell as a Hottentot; neither are their heads free from vermin, though we ob&s;erved that they were furni&s;hed with combs, both of bone and wood: the&s;e combs are &s;ometimes worn, &s;tuck upright in the hair as an ornament, a fa&s;hion which at pre&s;ent prevails among the ladies of England. The men generally wear their beards &s;hort, and their hair tied upon the crown of the head, in a bunch, in which they &s;tick the fea|thers of various birds, in different manners, according to their fancies; &s;ometimes one is placed on each &s;ide of the temples, pointing forwards, which, we thought, made a very di&s;agree|able appearance. The women wear their hair &s;ometimes cropped &s;hort, and &s;ometimes flowing over their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The bodies of both &s;exes are marked with the black &s;tains called Amoco, by the &s;ame method that is u&s;ed at Otaheite, and called Tattowing; but the men are more marked, and the women le&s;s. The women in general &s;tain no part of their bo|dies but the lips, though &s;ometimes they are marked with &s;mall black patches on other parts; the men, on the contrary, &s;eem to add &s;omething every year to the ornaments of the la&s;t, &s;o that &s;ome of them, who appeared to be of an advanced age, were almo&s;t covered from head to foot. Be&s;ides the Amoco, they have marks impre&s;&s;ed by a method unknown to us, of a very ex|traordinary kind: they are furrows of about a line deep, and a line broad, &s;uch as appear upon the bark of a tree which has been cut through, after a year's growth: the edges of the&s;e furrows are afterwards indented by the &s;ame method, and be|ing perfectly black, they make a mo&s;t frightful appearance. The faces of the old men are almo&s;t covered with the&s;e marks; tho&s;e who are very young, black only their lips like the women; when they are &s;omewhat older, they have generally a black patch upon one cheek, and over one eye, and &s;o proceed gra|dually, that they may grow old and honourable together: but though we could not but be di&s;gu&s;ted with the horrid Deformi|ty which the&s;e &s;tains and furrows produced in the <Q>human face divine,</Q> we could not but admire the dexterity and art
<PB N="27" REF="013324_0316_0F90F27A746CEDD0">
with which they were impre&s;&s;ed. The marks upon the face in general are &s;pirals, which are drawn with great nicety, and even elegance, tho&s;e on one &s;ide exactly corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e on the other: the marks on the body &s;omewhat re&s;emble the foliage in old cha&s;ed ornaments, and the convolutions of fill agree work; but in the&s;e they have &s;uch a luxuriance of fancy, that of an hundred, which at fir&s;t &s;ight appeared to be exactly the &s;ame, no two were, upon a clo&s;e examination, found to be alike. We ob&s;erved, that the quantity and form of the&s;e marks were different in different parts of the coa&s;t, and that as the principal &s;eat of them at Otaheite was the breach, in New Zealand it was &s;ometimes the only part which was free, and in general was le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed than any other.</P>
<P>The &s;kins of the&s;e people, however, are not only dyed, but painted, for as I have before ob&s;erved, they &s;mear their bo|dies with red oker, &s;ome rubbing it on dry, and &s;ome apply|ing it in large patches mixed with oil, which is always wet, and which the lea&s;t touch will rub off, &s;o that the tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions of &s;uch of our people as were guilty of ravi&s;hing a ki&s;s from the&s;e blooming beauties, were mo&s;t legibly written upon their faces.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of a New Zealander is certainly, to a &s;tranger at fir&s;t &s;ight, the mo&s;t uncouth that can be imagined. It is made of the leaves of the flag, which has been de&s;cribed among the vegetable productions of this country: the&s;e leaves are &s;plit into three or four &s;lips, and the &s;lips, when they are dry, interwoven with each other into a kind of &s;tuff between netting and cloth, with all the ends, which are eight or nine inches long, hanging out on the upper &s;ide, like the &s;hag or thrumb matts, which we &s;ometimes &s;ee lying in a pa&s;&s;age. Of this cloth, if cloth it may be called, two pieces &s;erve for a complete dre&s;s; one of them is tied over their &s;houlders with a &s;tring, and reaches as low as their knees; to the end of this &s;tring is fa&s;tened a bodkin of bone, which is ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed through any two parts of this upper garment, &s;o as to tack them together; the other piece is wrapped round the wai&s;t, and reaches nearly to the ground: the lower garment, how|ever, is worn by the men only upon particular occa&s;ions; but they wear a belt, to which a &s;tring is fa&s;tened, for a very &s;in|gular u&s;e. The inhabitants of the South Sea i&s;lands &s;lit up the prepuce &s;o as to prevent it from covering the glans of the pe|nis, but the&s;e people, on the contrary, bring the prepuce over the glans, and to prevent it from being drawn back by the contraction of the part, they tie the &s;tring which hangs from their girdle, round the end of it. The glans indeed &s;eemed to be the only part of their body which they were &s;olicitous to conceal, for they frequently threw off all their dre&s;s but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elt and &s;tring, with the mo&s;t carele&s;s indifference, but &s;hewed
<PB N="28" REF="013324_0317_0F90F27C115A98B0">
manife&s;t &s;igns of confu&s;ion, when, to gratify our curio&s;ity, they were reque&s;ted to untie the &s;tring, and never con&s;ented but with the utmo&s;t reluctance and &s;hame. When they have only their upper garment on, and &s;it upon their hams, they bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to a thatched hou&s;e; but this covering, though it is ugly, is well adapted to the u&s;e of tho&s;e who fre|quently &s;leep in the open air, without any other &s;helter from the rain.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this cour&s;e &s;hag or thatch, they have two &s;orts of cloth, which have an even &s;urface, and are very ingeniou&s;ly made, in the &s;ame manner with that manuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ctured by the inha|bitants of South America, &s;ome of which we procured at Rio de Janeiro. One &s;ort is as coar&s;e as our coar&s;e&s;t canvas, and &s;omewhat re&s;embles it in the manner of laying the threads, but it is ten times as &s;trong: the other is formed by many threads lying very clo&s;e one way, and a few cro&s;&s;ing them the other, &s;o as to bind them together; but the&s;e are about half an inch a&s;under, &s;omewhat like the round pieces of cane matting which are &s;ometimes placed under the di&s;hes upon a table. This is frequently &s;triped, and always had a pretty appearance, for it is compo&s;ed of the fibres of the &s;ame plant, which are prepared &s;o as to &s;hine like &s;ilk. It is made in a kind of frame, of the &s;ize of the cloth, generally about five feet long, and four broad, acro&s;s which the long threads, which lie clo&s;e together, or warp, are &s;trained, and the cro&s;s threads or woof, are worked in by hand, which mu&s;t be a very tedious operation.</P>
<P>To both the&s;e kinds of cloth they work borders of different colours, in &s;titches, &s;omewhat like carpeting, or rather like tho&s;e u&s;ed in the &s;amplars which girls work at &s;chool. The&s;e borders are of various patterns, and wrought with a neatne&s;s, and even an elegance, which, con&s;idering they have no needle, is &s;urprizing: but the great pride of their dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the fur of their dogs, which they u&s;e with &s;uch oeconomy that they cut it into &s;tripes, and &s;ew them upon their cloth at a di&s;tance from each other, which is a &s;trong proof that dogs are not plenty among them; the&s;e &s;tripes are al&s;o of different colours, and di&s;po&s;ed &s;o as to produce a plea&s;ing effect. We &s;aw &s;ome dre&s;&s;es that were adorned with feathers in&s;tead of fur, but the&s;e were not common; and we &s;aw one that was entirely covered with the red feathers of the parrot.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the man who was killed, when we fir&s;t went a&s;hore in Poverty Bay, has been de&s;cribed already; but we &s;aw the &s;ame dre&s;s only once more during our &s;tay upon the coa&s;t, and that was in Queen Charlotte's Sound.</P>
<P>The women, contrary to the cu&s;tom of the &s;ex in general, &s;eemed to affect dre&s;s rather le&s;s than the men: their hair, which, as I have ob&s;erved before, is generally cropt &s;hort, is never tied upon the top of the head when it is &s;uffered to be
<PB N="29" REF="013324_0318_0F90F27C33B0FC88">
long, nor is it ever adorned with feathers. Their garments were made of the &s;ame materials, and in the &s;ame form, as tho&s;e of the other &s;ex, but the lower one was always bound fa&s;t round them, except when they went into the water to catch lob&s;ters, and then they took great care not to be &s;een by the men. Some of us happening one day to land upon a &s;mall i&s;land in Tolaga Bay, we &s;urprized &s;everal of them at this em|ployment; and the cha&s;te Diana, with her nymphs, could not have di&s;covered more confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s at the &s;ight of Ac|taeon, than the&s;e women expre&s;&s;ed upon our approach. Some of them hid them&s;elves among the rocks, and the re&s;t crouched down in the &s;ea till they had made them&s;elves a girdle and apron of &s;uch weeds as they could find, and when they came out, even with this veil, we could perceive that their mode&s;ty &s;uffered much pain by our pre&s;ence. The girdle and apron which they wear in common, have been mentioned before.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes bore their ears, and by &s;tretching them the holes become large enough to admit a &s;inger at lea&s;t. In the&s;e holes they wear ornaments of various kinds, cloth, feathers, bones of large birds, and even &s;ometimes a &s;tick of wood; and to the&s;e receptacles of finery they generally applied the nails which we gave them, and every thing which it was po&s;&s;ible they could contain. The women &s;ometimes thru&s;t through them the down of the albatro&s;s, which is as white as &s;now, and which, &s;preading before and behind the hole in a bunch almo&s;t as big as the fi&s;t, makes a very &s;ingular, and however &s;trange it may be thought, not a di&s;agreeable appearance. Be&s;ides the orna|ments that are thru&s;t through the holes of the ears, many others are &s;u&s;pended to them by &s;trings; &s;uch as chi&s;&s;els or bodkins made of green talc, upon which they &s;et a high value, the nails and teeth of their decea&s;ed relations, the teeth of dogs, and eve|ry thing el&s;e that they can get, which they think either curious or valuable. The women al&s;o wear bracelets and anclets, made of the bones of birds, &s;hells, or any other &s;ub&s;tances which they can perforate, and &s;tring upon a thread. The men had &s;ome|times hanging to a &s;tring, which went round the neck, a piece of green talc, or whalebone, &s;omewhat in the &s;hape of a tongue, with the rude figure of a man carved upon it; and upon this ornament they &s;et a high value. In one in&s;tance, we &s;aw the gri&s;tle that divides the no&s;trils, and called by anatomi&s;ts, the <HI>&s;eptum na&s;i,</HI> perforated, and a feather thru&s;t through the hole, which projected on each &s;ide over the cheeks: it is probable that this frightful &s;ingularity was intended as an ornament, but of the many people we &s;aw, we never ob&s;erved it in any other, nor even a perforation that might occa&s;ionally &s;erve for &s;uch a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are the mo&s;t inartificially made of any thing among them, being &s;carcely equal, except in &s;ize, to an Engli&s;h dog-kennel:
<PB N="30" REF="013324_0319_0F905038A7A2AEC8">
they are &s;eldom more than eighteen or twenty feet long, eight or ten broad, and five or &s;ix high, from the pole that runs from one end to the other, and forms the ridge, to the ground: the framing is of wood, generally &s;lender &s;ticks, and both walls and roof con&s;i&s;t of dry gra&s;s and hay, which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is very tightly put together; and &s;ome are al&s;o lined with the bark of trees, &s;o that in cold weather they mu&s;t afford a very comfortable retreat. The roof is &s;lop|ing, like tho&s;e of our barns, and the door is at one end, ju&s;t high enough to admit a man, creeping upon his hands and knees: near the door is a &s;quare hole, which &s;erves for the double office of window and chimney, for the fire-place is at that end, nearly in the middle between the two &s;ides: in &s;ome con&s;picuous part, and generally near the door, a plank is fixed, covered with carving after their manner: this they value as we do a picture, and in their e&s;timation it is not an inferior orna|ment: the &s;ide walls aud roof project about two feet beyond the walls at each end, &s;o as to form a kind of porch, in which there are benches for the accommodation of the family. That part of the floor which is allotted for the fire-place, is enclo&s;ed in a hollow &s;quare, by partitions either of wood or &s;tone, and in the middle of it the fire is kindled. The floor along the in&s;ide of the walls, is thickly covered with &s;traw, and upon this the family &s;leep.</P>
<P>Their furniture and implements con&s;i&s;t of but few articles, and one che&s;t commonly contains them all, except their pro|vi&s;ion ba&s;kets, the gourds that hold their fre&s;h water, and the hammers that are u&s;ed to beat their fern-root, which generally &s;tand without the door: &s;ome rude tools, their cloaths, arms, and a few feathers to &s;tick in their hair, make the re&s;t of their trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Some of the better &s;ort, who&s;e families are large, have three or four hou&s;es enclo&s;ed within a court-yard, the walls of which are con&s;tructed of poles and hay, and are about ten or twelve feet high.</P>
<P>When we were on &s;hore in the di&s;trict called Tolaga, we &s;aw the ruins, or rather the frame of a hou&s;e, for it had never been fini&s;hed, much &s;uperior in &s;ize to any that we &s;aw el&s;e|where: it was thirty feet in length, about fifteen in breadth, and twelve high: the &s;ides of it were adorned with many carv|ed planks, of a workman&s;hip much &s;uperior to any other that we had met with in the country; but for what purpo&s;e it was built, or why it was de&s;erted, we could never learn.</P>
<P>But the&s;e people, though in their hou&s;es they are &s;o well de|fended from the inclemency of the weather, &s;eem to be quite indifferent whether they have any &s;helter at all during their ex|cur&s;ions in &s;earch of fern roots and fi&s;h, &s;ometimes &s;etting up a &s;mall &s;hade to windward, and &s;ometimes altogether neglecting

even that precaution, &s;leeping with their women and children under bu&s;hes, with their weapons ranged round them, in the manner that has already been de&s;cribed. The party con&s;i&s;ting of forty or fifty, whom we &s;aw at Mercury Bay, in a di&s;trict which the natives call Opoorage, never erected the lea&s;t &s;helter while we &s;taid there, though it &s;ometimes rained ince&s;&s;antly for four and twenty hours together.</P>
<P>The articles of their food have been enumerated already; the principal, which to them is what bread is to the inhabi|tants of Europe, is the roots of the fern which grows upon the hills, and is nearly the &s;ame with what grows upon our high commons in England, and is called indifferently fern, bracken, or brakes. The birds which &s;ometimes &s;erve them for a fea&s;t, are chiefly penguins and albatro&s;&s;es, with a few other &s;pecies that have been occa&s;ionally mentioned in this narrative.</P>
<P>Having no ve&s;&s;el in which water can be boiled, their cooke|ry con&s;i&s;ts wholly of baking and roa&s;ting. They bake nearly in the &s;ame manner as the inhabitants of the South Seas, and to the account that has been already given of their roa&s;ting, nothing need be added, but that the long &s;kewer or &s;pit, to which the fle&s;h is fa&s;tened, is placed &s;loping towards the fire, by &s;etting one &s;tone again&s;t the bottom of it, and &s;upporting it near the middle with another, by the moving of which to a greater or le&s;s di&s;tance from the end, the degree of obliquity is increa&s;ed, or dimini&s;hed, at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>To the northward, as I have ob&s;erved, there are plantations of yams, &s;weet potatoes, and coccos, but we &s;aw no &s;uch to the &s;outhward; the inhabitants therefore of that part of the country mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t wholly upon fern root and fi&s;h, except the &s;canty and accidental re&s;ource which they may find in &s;ea fowl and dogs; and that fern and fi&s;h are not to be procured at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, even at the &s;ea &s;ide, and upon the neighbouring hills, is manife&s;t from the &s;tores of both that we &s;aw laid up dry, and the reluctance which &s;ome of them ex|pre&s;&s;ed at &s;elling any part of them to us when we offered to purcha&s;e them, at lea&s;t the fi&s;h, for &s;ea &s;tores: and this parti|cular &s;eems to confirm my opinion that this country &s;carcely &s;u&s;tains the pre&s;ent number of its inhabitants, who are urged to perpetual ho&s;tilities by hunger, which naturally prompted them to eat the dead bodies of tho&s;e who were &s;lain in the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Water is their univer&s;al and only liquor, as far as we could di&s;cover, and if they have really no means of intoxication, they are, in this particular, happy beyond any other people that we have yet &s;een or heard of.</P>
<P>As there is perhaps no &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e either critical or chronic, but intemperance and inactivity, it cannot be thought &s;trange that the&s;e people enjoy perfect and uninterrupted

health: in all our vi&s;its to their towns, where young and old, men and women, crouded about us, prompted by the &s;ame curio&s;ity that carried us to look at them, we never &s;aw a &s;ingle per&s;on who appeared to have any bodily complaint, nor among the numbers that we have &s;een naked, did we once perceive the &s;lighte&s;t eruption upon the &s;kin, or any marks that an eruption had left behind: at fir&s;t, indeed, ob&s;erving that &s;ome of them when they came off to us were marked in patches with a white flowery appearance upon different parts of their bo|dies, we thought that they were leprous, or highly &s;corbutic; but upon examination we found that the&s;e marks were owing to their having been wetted by the &s;prey of the &s;ea in their pa&s;&s;age, which, when it was dried away, left the &s;alts behind it in a fine white powder.</P>
<P>Another proof of health, which we have mentioned upon a former occa&s;ion, is the facility with which the wounds healed that had left &s;cars behind them, and that we &s;aw in a recent &s;tate; when we &s;aw the man who had been &s;hot with a mu&s;ket ball thro' the fle&s;hy part of his arm, his wound &s;eemed to be &s;o well dige&s;ted, and in &s;o fair a way of being perfectly healed, that if I had not known no application had been made to it, I &s;hould certainly have enquired, with a very intere&s;ted curio|&s;ity, after the vulnerary herbs, and &s;urgical art of the country.</P>
<P>A farther proof that human nature is here untainted with di&s;ea&s;e, is the great number of old men that we &s;aw, many of whom, by the lo&s;s of their hair and teeth, appeared to be very ancient, yet none of them were decrepit, and though not equal to the young in mu&s;cular &s;trength, were not a whit behind them in cheerfulne&s;s and vivacity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the canoes and navigation of the inhabitants of New Zealand; their tillage, weapons, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE ingenuity of the&s;e people appears in nothing more than in their canoes; they are long and narrow, and in &s;hape very much re&s;emble a New England whale boat: the lar|ger &s;ort &s;eem to be built chiefly for war, and will carry from forty to eighty, or an hundred armed men. We mea&s;ured one which lay a&s;hore at Tolaga: &s;he was &s;ixty-eight feet and an half long, five feet broad, and three feet and an half deep; the bottom was &s;harp, with &s;trait &s;ides like a wedge, and con|&s;i&s;ted of three lengths, hollowed out to about two inches, or an
<PB N="33" REF="013324_0322_0F90F27F63654780">
inch and an half thick, and well fa&s;tened together with &s;trong plaiting: each &s;ide con&s;i&s;ted of one entire plank, &s;ixty-three feet long, ten or twelve inches broad, and about an inch and a quarter thick, and the&s;e were fitted and la&s;hed to the bot|tom part with great dexterity and &s;trength. A con&s;iderable number of thwarts were laid from gunwale to gunwale, to which they were &s;ecurely la&s;hed on each &s;ide, as a &s;trenthening to the boat. The ornament at the head projected five or &s;ix feet beyond the body, and was about four feet and an half high; the ornament at the &s;tern was fixed upon that end, as the &s;tern-po&s;t of a &s;hip is upon her keel, and was about four|teen feet high, two feet broad, and an inch and and half thick. They both con&s;i&s;ted of boards of carved work; of which the de&s;ign was much better than the execution. All their canoes, except a few at Opoorage or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Bay, which were of one piece, and hollowed by fire, are built after this plan, and few are le&s;s than twenty feet long: &s;ome of the &s;maller &s;ort have outriggers, and &s;ometimes two of them are joined together, but this is not common. The carving upon the &s;tern and head ornaments of the inferior boats, which &s;eem to be intended wholly for fi&s;hing, con&s;i&s;ts of the figure of a man, with a face as ugly as can be conceived, and a mon&s;trous tongue thru&s;t out of the mouth, with the white &s;hells of &s;ea ears &s;tuck in for the eyes. But the canoes of the &s;uperior kind, which &s;eem to be their men of war, are magnificently adorned with open work, and covered with loo&s;e fringes of black feathers, which had a mo&s;t elegant appearance: the gunwale boards were al&s;o fre|quently carved in a grote&s;que ta&s;te, and adorned with tufts of white feathers, placed upon a black ground. Of vi&s;ible ob|jects that are wholly new, no verbal de&s;cription can convey a ju&s;t idea, but in proportion as they re&s;emble &s;ome that are al|ready known, to which the mind of the reader mu&s;t be re|ferred: the carving of the&s;e people are of a &s;ingular kind, and not in the likene&s;s of any thing that is known on our &s;ide of the ocean, <Q>either in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters that are under the earth.</Q></P>
<P>The paddles are &s;mall, light, and neatly made; the blade of it is of an oval &s;hape, or rather of a &s;hape re&s;embling a large leaf, pointed at the bottom, broade&s;t in the middle, and gra|dually loo&s;ing it&s;elf in the &s;haft, the whole length being about &s;ix feet, of which the &s;haft or loom, including the handle, is four, and the blade two. By the help of the&s;e oars they pu&s;h on their boats with amazing velocity.</P>
<P>In &s;ailing they are not expert, having no art of going other|wi&s;e than before the wind: the &s;ail is of netting or matt, which is &s;et up between two poles that are fixed upright upon each gunwale, and &s;erve both for ma&s;ts and yards: two ropes an|&s;wered the purpo&s;e of &s;heets, and were con&s;equently fa&s;tened
<PB N="34" REF="013324_0323_0F90F27FF0E97FE8">
above, to the top of each pole. But clum&s;y and inconvenient as this apparatus is, they make good way before the wind, and are &s;teered by two men who &s;it in the &s;tern, with each a paddle in his hand for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much of their workman&s;hip, I &s;hall now give &s;ome account of their tools; they have adzes, axes, and chi&s;&s;els, which &s;erve them al&s;o as augers for the boring of holes: as they have no metal, their adzes and axes are made of a hard black &s;tone, or of a green talc, which is not only hard but tough; and their chi&s;&s;els of human bone, or &s;mall frag|ments of ja&s;par, which they chip off from a block in &s;harp an|gular pieces, like a gun-flint. Their axes they value above all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and never would part with one of them for any thing that we could give: I once offered one of the be&s;t axes I had in the &s;hip, be&s;ides a number of other things for one of them, but the owner would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell it; from which I conclude that good ones are &s;carce among them. Their &s;mall tools of ja&s;par, which are u&s;ed in fini&s;hing their nice&s;t work, they u&s;e till they are blunt, and then, as they have no means of &s;har|pening them, throw them away. We had given the people at Tolaga a piece of gla&s;s, and in a &s;hort time they found means to drill a hole through it, in order to hang it round the neck as as ornament by a thread; and we imagine the tool mu&s;t have been a piece of this ja&s;par. How they bring their large tools fir&s;t to an edge, and &s;harpen the weapon which they call Patoo-Patoo, we could not certainly learn; but probably it is by brui&s;ing the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance to powder, and, with this, grind|ing two pieces again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>Their nets, particularly their &s;eine, which is of an enor|mous &s;ize, have been mentioned already: one of the&s;e &s;eems to be the joint work of a whole town, and I &s;uppo&s;e it to be the joint property al&s;o: the other net, which is circular, and extended by two or three hoops, has been particularly de|&s;cribed, as well as the manner of baiting and u&s;ing it. Their hooks are of bone or &s;hell, and in general are ill made. To receive the fi&s;h when it is caught, and to hold their other pro|vi&s;ions, they have ba&s;kets of various kinds and dimen&s;ions, very neatly made of wicker work.</P>
<P>They excel in tillage, as might naturally be expected where the per&s;on that &s;ows is to eat the produce, and where there is &s;o little be&s;ides that can be eaten: when we fir&s;t came to TE|GADOO, a di&s;trict between Poverty Bay and Ea&s;t Cape, their crops were ju&s;t covered, and had not yet begun to &s;prout; the mould was as &s;mooth as in a garden, and every root had its &s;mall hillock, ranged in a regular quincunx by lines, which, with the pegs, were &s;till remaining in the field. We had not an opportunity to &s;ee any of the&s;e hu&s;bandmen work, but we &s;aw what &s;erves them at once for &s;pade and plough: this in|&s;trument
<PB N="35" REF="013324_0324_0F90F28554BDB910">
is nothing more than a long narrow &s;take &s;harpened to an edge at one end, with a &s;hort piece fa&s;tened tran&s;ver&s;ely at a little di&s;tance above it, for the convenience of pre&s;&s;ing it down with the foot. With this they turn up pieces of ground &s;ix or &s;even acres in extent, though it is not more than three inches broad; but as the &s;oil is light and &s;andy it makes little re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Tillage, weaving, and the other arts of peace, &s;eem to be be&s;t known and mo&s;t practi&s;ed in the northern part of this country; for there is little appearance of any of them in the South: but the arts of war flouri&s;h equally through the whole coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Of weapons they have no great variety, but &s;uch as they have are well fitted for de&s;truction; they have &s;pears, darts, battle-axes, and the Patoo-Patoo. The &s;pear is fourteen or fifteen feet long, pointed at both ends, and &s;ometimes headed with bone: the&s;e are gra&s;ped by the middle, &s;o that the part behind balancing that before, makes a pu&s;h more difficult to be parried, than that of a weapon which is held by the end. The dart and other weapons have been &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed al|ready; and it has al&s;o been remarked, that the&s;e people have neither &s;ling nor bow. They throw the dart by hand, and &s;o they do &s;tones; but darts and &s;tones are &s;eldom u&s;ed, except in defending their forts. Their battles, whether in boats or on &s;hore, are generally hand to hand, and the &s;laughter mu&s;t con|&s;equently be great, as a &s;econd blow with any of their wea|pons is unnece&s;&s;ary, if the fir&s;t takes place: their tru&s;t, how|ever, &s;eems to be principally placed in the Patoo-Patoo, which is fa&s;tened to their wri&s;ts by a &s;trong &s;trap, le&s;t it &s;hould be wrenched from them, and which the principal people generally wear &s;ticking in their girdles, con&s;idering it as a military or|nament, and part of their dre&s;s, like the poinard of the A&s;ia|tic, and the &s;word of the European. They have no defen&s;ive armour; but, be&s;ides their weapons, the Chiefs carried a &s;taff of di&s;tinction, in the &s;ame manner as our officers do the &s;pon|toon: this was generally the rib of a whale, as white as &s;now, with many ornaments of carved work, dog's hair, and feathers; but &s;ometimes it was a &s;tick, about &s;ix feet long, adorned in the &s;ame manner, and inlaid with a &s;hell like mother-of-pearl. Tho&s;e who bore this mark of di&s;tinction were generally old, at lea&s;t pa&s;t the middle age, and were al&s;o more marked with the <HI>Amoco</HI> than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>One or more per&s;ons, thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, always appeared in each canoe; when they came to attack us, according to the &s;ize of it. When they came within about a cable's length of the &s;hip, they u&s;ed to &s;top, and the Chiefs ri&s;ing from their &s;eat, put on a dre&s;s which &s;eemed appropriated to the occa&s;ion, generally of dog's &s;kin, and holding out their decorated &s;taff, or a weapon, directed the re&s;t of the people what they &s;hould
<PB N="36" REF="013324_0325_0F8FFB8CAD19CAA8">
do. When they were at too great a di&s;tance to reach us with a lance or a &s;tone, they pre&s;umed that we had no weapons with which we could reach them, here then the defiance was given, and the words were almo&s;t univer&s;ally the &s;ame, <HI>Haromai, ha|romai, har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e uta a Patoo-Patoo age:</HI> <Q>Come to us, come on &s;hore, and we will kill you all with our Patoo-Patoos.</Q> While they were uttering the&s;e menaces they came gradually nearer and nearer, till they were clo&s;e along &s;ide; talking at intervals in a peaceable &s;train, and an&s;wering any que&s;tions that we a&s;ked them; and at intervals renewing their defiance and threats, till being encouraged by our apparent timidity, they began their war-&s;ong and dance, as a prelude to an attack, which always followed, and was &s;ometimes continued till it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;s them by firing &s;ome &s;mall-&s;hot; and &s;ometimes ended after throwing a few &s;tones on board, as if content with having offered us an in&s;ult, which we did not dare to revenge.</P>
<P>The war-dance con&s;i&s;ts of a great variety of violent motions, and hideous contortions of the limbs, during which the coun|tenance al&s;o performs its part; the tongue is frequently thru&s;t out to an incredible length, and the eye-lids &s;o forcibly drawn up that the white appears both above and below, as well as on each &s;ide of the iris, &s;o as to form a circle round it; nor is any thing neglected that can render the human &s;hape frightful and deformed: at the &s;ame time they brandi&s;h their &s;pears, &s;hake their darts, and cleave the air with their Patoo-Patoos. This horrid dance is always accompanied by a &s;ong; it is wild indeed, but not di&s;agreeable, and every &s;train ends in a loud and deep &s;igh, which they utter in concert. In the motions of the dance, however horrid, there is a &s;trength, firmne&s;s, and agility, which we could not but behold with admiration; and in their &s;ong they keep time with &s;uch exactne&s;s, that I have often heard above an hundred paddles &s;truck again&s;t the &s;ides, of their boats at once, &s;o as to produce but a &s;ingle &s;ound, at the divi&s;ions of their mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>A &s;ong not altogether unlike this, they &s;ometimes &s;ing without the dance, and as a peaceable amu&s;ement: they have al&s;o other &s;ongs which are &s;ung by the women, who&s;e voices are remarkably mellow and &s;oft, and have a plea&s;ing and ten|der effect; the time is &s;low, and the cadence mournful; but it is conducted with more ta&s;te than could be expected among the poor ignorant &s;avages of this half de&s;olate country; e&s;pecially as it appeared to us, who were none of us much acquainted with mu&s;ic as a &s;cience, to be &s;ung in parts; it was at lea&s;t &s;ung by many voices at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>They have &s;onorous in&s;truments, but they can &s;carcely be called in&s;truments of mu&s;ic; one is the &s;hell, called the Tri|ton's trumpet, with which they make a noi&s;e not unlike that
<PB N="37" REF="013324_0326_0F90F2884387F9F8">
which our boys &s;ometimes make with a cow's horn: the other is a &s;mall wooden pipe, re&s;embling a child's nine-pin, only much &s;maller, and in this there is no more mu&s;ic than in a pea-whi&s;tle. They &s;eem &s;en&s;ible indeed that the&s;e in&s;truments are not mu&s;ical; for we never heard an attempt to &s;ing to them, or to produce with them any mea&s;ured tones that bore the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to a tune.</P>
<P>To what has been already &s;aid of the practice of eating hu|man fle&s;h, I &s;hall only add, that in almo&s;t every cove where we landed, we found fle&s;h bones of men near the places where fires had been made; and that among the heads that were brought on board by the old man, &s;ome &s;eemed to have fal&s;e eyes, and ornaments in their ears as if alive. That which Mr. Banks bought was &s;old with great reluctance by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: the head was manife&s;tly that of a young per&s;on about fourteen or fifteen years of age, and by the contu&s;ions on one &s;ide ap|peared to have received many violent blows, and indeed a part of the bone near the eye was wanting. The&s;e appearances confirmed us in the opinion that the natives of this country give no quarter, nor take any pri&s;oners to be killed and eaten at a future time, as is &s;aid to have been a practice among the Indians of Florida: for if pri&s;oners had been taken, this poor young creature, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of making much re&s;i&s;tance, would probably have been one, and we knew that he was killed with the re&s;t, for the fray had happened but a few days before.</P>
<P>The towns or Hippahs of the&s;e people, which are all forti|fied, have been &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed already, and from the Bay of Plenty to Queen Charlotte's Sound they &s;eem to be the con&s;tant re&s;idence of the people: but about Poverty Bay, Hawk's Bay, Tegadoo, and Tolaga, we &s;aw no Hippahs, but &s;ingle hou&s;es &s;cattered at a di&s;tance from each other; yet upon the &s;ides of the hills there were &s;tages of great length, fur|ni&s;hed with &s;tones and darts, probably as retreats for the people at the la&s;t extremity, as upon the&s;e &s;tages a fight may be carried on with much advantage again&s;t tho&s;e below, who may be reached, with great effect, by darts and &s;tones, which it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to throw up with equal force. And indeed the forts them&s;elves &s;eem to be no farther &s;erviceable than by enabling the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to repre&s;s a &s;udden attack; for as there is no &s;upply of water within the lines, it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege. A con&s;iderable &s;tock of fern-root and dry fi&s;h is indeed laid up in them; but they may be re|&s;erved again&s;t &s;ea&s;ons of &s;carcity, and that &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons there are, our ob&s;ervations left us no room to doubt; be&s;ides, while an enemy &s;hould be prowling in the neighbourhood, it would be ea&s;y to &s;natch a &s;upply of water from the &s;ide of the hill, though it would be impo&s;&s;ible to dig up fern root, or catch fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="013324_0327_0F8FFB8D91CD5B98">
In this di&s;trict, however, the people &s;eemed to live in a &s;tate of con&s;cious &s;ecurity, and to avail them&s;elves of their advantage: their plantations were more numerous, their ca|noes were more decorated, and they had not only finer carv|ing, but finer clothes. This part of the coa&s;t al&s;o was much the mo&s;t populous, and po&s;&s;ibly their apparent peace and plenty might ari&s;e from their being united under one Chief, or King; for the inhabitants of all this part of the country told us, that they were the &s;ubjects of Teratu: when they pointed to the re&s;idence of this Prince, it was in a direction which we thought inland; but which, when we knew the country better, we found to be the Bay of Plenty.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted that we were obliged to leave this country without knowing any thing of Teratu but his name. As an Indian Monarch his territory is certainly exten&s;ive: he was acknowledged from Cape Kidnappers to the northward, and we&s;tward as far as the Bay of Plenty, a length of coa&s;t upwards of eighty leagues; and we do not yet know how much farther we&s;tward his dominions may extend. Po&s;&s;ibly the for|tified towns we &s;aw in the Bay of Plenty may be his Barrier; e&s;pecially as at Mercury Bay he was not acknowledged, nor indeed any other &s;ingle Chief: for wherever we landed, or &s;poke with the people upon that coa&s;t, they told us that we were but at a &s;mall di&s;tance from their enemies.</P>
<P>In the dominions of Teratu we &s;aw &s;everal &s;ubordinate Chiefs, to whom great re&s;pect was paid, and by whom ju&s;tice was probably admini&s;tered; for upon our complaint to one of them, of a theft that had been committed on board the &s;hip by a man that came with him, he gave him &s;everal blows and kicks, which the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">eived as the cha&s;ti&s;ement of authori|ty, again&s;t which no re&s;i&s;tance was to be made, and which he had no right to re&s;ent. Whether this authority was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by appointment or inheritance we could not learn; but we ob&s;erved that the Chiefs, as well here as in other parts, were elderly men. In other parts, however, we learnt that they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed their authority by inheritance.</P>
<P>The little &s;ocieties which we found in the &s;outhern parts &s;eemed to have &s;everal things in common, particularly their fine clothes and fi&s;hing nets. Their fine clothes, which po&s;|&s;ibly might be the &s;poils of war, were kept in a &s;mall hut, which was erected for that purpo&s;e in the middle of the town: the nets we &s;aw making in almo&s;t every hou&s;e, and the &s;everal parts being afterwards collected were joined together. Le&s;s ac|count &s;eems to be made of the women here than in the South Sea i&s;lands; &s;uch at lea&s;t was the opinion of Tupia, who com|plained of it as an indignity to the &s;ex.

<P>Of the religion of the&s;e people it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that we could learn much; they acknowledge the influence of &s;u|perior beings, one of whom is &s;upreme, and the re&s;t &s;ubor|dinate; and gave nearly the &s;ame account of the origin of the world, and the production of mankind, as our friends in Ota|heite: Tupia, however, &s;eemed to have a much more deep and exten&s;ive knowledge of the&s;e &s;ubjects than any of the people here; and whenever he was di&s;po&s;ed to in&s;truct them, which he &s;ometimes did in a long di&s;cour&s;e, he was &s;ure of a nume|rous audience, who li&s;tened in profound &s;ilence, with &s;uch re|verence and attention, that we could not but wi&s;h them a bet|ter teacher.</P>
<P>What homage they pay to the deities they acknowledge we could not learn; but we &s;aw no place of public wor&s;hip, like the Morais of the South Sea i&s;lands: yet we &s;aw, near a plan|tation of &s;weet potatoes, a &s;mall area, of a &s;quare figure, &s;ur|rounded with &s;tones, in the middle of which one of the &s;har|pened &s;takes, which they u&s;e as a &s;pade, was &s;et up, and upon it was hung a ba&s;ket of fern roots: upon enquiry, the natives told us, that it was an offering to the gods, by which the owner hoped to render them propitious, and obtain a plenti|ful crop.</P>
<P>As to their manner of di&s;po&s;ing of their dead, we could form no certain opinion of it&punc; for the accounts that we received by no means agreed. In the northern parts, they told us that they buried them in the ground; and in the &s;outhern, that they threw them into the &s;ea: it is however certain that we &s;aw no grave in the country, and that they affected to conceal every thing relating to their dead with a kind of my&s;terious &s;e|crecy. But whatever may be the &s;epulchre, the living are them&s;elves the monuments; for we &s;aw &s;carcely a &s;ingle per&s;on of either &s;ex who&s;e body was not marked by the &s;cars of wounds which they had inflicted upon them&s;elves as a te&s;timony of their regret for the lo&s;s of a relation or friend: &s;ome of the&s;e wounds we &s;aw in a &s;tate &s;o recent that the blood was &s;carcely &s;taunch|ed, which &s;hows that death had been among them while we were upon the coa&s;t; and makes it more extraordinary that no funeral ceremony &s;hould have fallen under our notice: &s;ome of

the &s;cars were very large and deep, and in many in&s;tances had greatly disfigured the face. One monument indeed we ob&s;erv|ed of another kind, the cro&s;s that was &s;et up near Queen Char|lotte's Sound.</P>
<P>Having now given the be&s;t account in my power of the cu&s;toms and opinions of the inhabitants of New Zealand, with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, nets, furniture, and dre&s;s, I &s;hall only remark, that the &s;imilitude between the&s;e particulars here and in the South Sea i&s;lands is a very &s;trong proof that the inhabitants have the &s;ame origin; and that the common ance&s;tors of both, were natives of the &s;ame country. They have both a tradition that their ance&s;tors, at a very remote period of time, came from another country; and, according to the tradition of both, that the name of that country was HEAWIJE; but the &s;imilitude of the language &s;eems to put the matter altogether out of doubt. I have already ob&s;erved, that Tupia, when he acco&s;ted the people here in the language of his own country, was perfectly under|&s;tood; and I &s;hall give a &s;pecimen of the &s;imilitude by a li&s;t of words in both languages, according to the dialect of the nor|thern and &s;outhern i&s;lands of which New Zealand con&s;i&s;ts, by which it will appear that the language of Otaheite does not differ more from that of New Zealand, than the language of the two i&s;lands from each other.</P>

<P>By this &s;pecimen, I think it appears to demon&s;tration that the language of New Zealand and Otaheite is radically the &s;ame. The language of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he northern and &s;outhern parts of New Zealand differs chiefly in the pronunciation, as the &s;ame Engli&s;h word is pronounced <HI>gate</HI> in Middle&s;ex, and <HI>geate</HI> in York&s;hire: and as the &s;outhern and northern words were not written down by the &s;ame per&s;on, one might po&s;&s;ibly u&s;e more letters to produce the &s;ame &s;ound than the other.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve, that it is the genius of the language, e&s;pecially in the &s;outhern parts, to put &s;ome article before a noun, as we do <HI>the</HI> or <HI>a;</HI> the articles u&s;ed here were generally <HI>he</HI> or <HI>ko:</HI> it is al&s;o common here to add the word <HI>oeia</HI> after an|other word, as an iteration, e&s;pecially if it is an an&s;wer to a que&s;tion: as we &s;ay <HI>yes indeed, to be &s;ure, really, certainly:</HI> this &s;ometimes led our gentlemen into the formation of words of an enormous length, judging by the ear only, without being able to refer each &s;ound into its &s;ignification. An example will make this perfectly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>In the Bay of I&s;lands there is a remarkable one, called by the natives MATU ARO. One of our gentlemen having a&s;ked a native the name of it, he an&s;wered, with the particle, <HI>Ke|matuaro;</HI> the gentleman hearing the &s;ound imperfectly, re|peated his que&s;tion, and the Indian repeating his an&s;wer, ad|ded <HI>ocia,</HI> which made the word <HI>Kematuaro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ria;</HI> and thus it
<PB N="42" REF="013324_0331_0F90F28C03603648">
happened that in the log book I found <HI>Matuaro</HI> transformed into <HI>Cumettiwarrow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ia:</HI> and the &s;ame transformation, by the &s;ame means, might happen to an Engli&s;h word. Suppo&s;e a native of New Zealand at Hackney church, to enquire <Q>what village is this?</Q> the an&s;wer would be, "it is Hackney:" &s;uppo&s;e the que&s;tion to be repeated with an air of doubt and un|certainty, the an&s;wer might be "it is Hackney indeed," and the New Zealander, if he had the u&s;e of letters, would probab|ly record, for the information of his countrymen, that during his re&s;idence among us he had vi&s;ited a village called "Ity&s;|hakneeindede." The article u&s;ed by the inhabitants of the South Sea i&s;lands in&s;tead of <HI>he</HI> or <HI>ko,</HI> is <HI>to</HI> or <HI>ta,</HI> but the word <HI>oeia</HI> is common to both; and when we began to learn the lan|guage, it led us into many ridiculous mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e i&s;lands, and tho&s;e in the South Seas, to have been peopled originally from the &s;ame country, it will perhaps for ever remain a doubt what country that is: we were, however, unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that the people did not come from America, which lies to the ea&s;tward; and except there &s;hould appear to be a continent to the &s;outhward, in a moderate latitude, it will follow that they came from the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>Thus far our navigation has certainly been unfavourable to the notion of a &s;outhern continent, for it has &s;wept away at lea&s;t three-fourths of the po&s;itions upon which it has been found|ed. The principal navigators, who&s;e authority has been urged on this occa&s;ion, are Ta&s;man, Juan Fernandes, Hermite, the commander of a Dutch &s;quadron, Quiros, and Roggewein; and the track of the Endeavour has demon&s;trated that the land &s;een by the&s;e per&s;ons, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be part of a conti|nent, is not &s;o; it has al&s;o totally &s;ubverted the theoretical ar|guments which have been brought to prove that the exi&s;tence of a &s;outhern continent is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve an equilibrium be|tween the two hemi&s;pheres; for upon this principle what we have already proved to be water, would render the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere too light. In our rout to the northward, after doubling Cape Horn, when we were in the latitude of 40&deg;, our longitude was 110&deg;; and in our return to the &s;outhward, after leaving Ulietea, when we were again in latitude 40&deg;, our longitude was 145&deg;; the difference is 35&deg;. When we were in latitude 30&deg; the difference of longitude between the two tracks was 21&deg;, which continued till we were as low as 20&deg;; but a &s;ingle view of the chart will convey a better idea of this than the mo&s;t minute de&s;cription: yet as upon a view of the chart it will appear that there is a large &s;pace extending quite to the Tropics, which neither we, nor any other navigators to bur knowledge have explored, and as there will appear to be room enough for the Cape of a &s;outhern continent, to ex|tend
<PB N="43" REF="013324_0332_0F90F28D836AD8F0">
northward into a low &s;outhern latitude, I &s;hall give my rea&s;ons for believing there is no Cape, of any &s;outhern con|tinent, to the northward of 40&deg; &s;outh.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what has been been laid down by &s;ome geo|graphers in their maps, and alledged by Mr. Dalrymple, with re&s;pect to Quiros, it is improbable in the highe&s;t degree, that he &s;aw to the &s;outhward of two i&s;lands, which he di&s;covered in latitude 25 or 26, and which I &s;uppo&s;e may lie between the longitude of 130&deg; and 140&deg; W. any &s;igns of a continent, much le&s;s any thing, which, in his opinion, was a known or indu|bitable &s;ign of &s;uch land; for if he had, he would certainly have &s;ailed &s;outhward in &s;earch of it, and if he had &s;ought, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;igns to have been indubitable, he mu&s;t have found: the di&s;covery of a &s;outhern continent was the ultimate object of Quiros's voyage, and no man appears to have had it more at heart; &s;o that if he was in latitude 26&deg; S. and in lon|gitude 146&deg; W. where Mr. Dalrymple has placed the i&s;lands he di&s;covered, it may fairly be inferred that no part of a &s;outhern continent extends to that latitude.</P>
<P>It will, I think, appear with equal evidence from the ac|counts of Roggewein's voyage, that between the longitudes of 130&deg; and 150&deg; W. there is no main land to the northward of 35 S. Mr. Pingre, in a treati&s;e concerning the tran&s;it of Ve|nus, which he went out to ob&s;erve, has in&s;erted an extract of Roggewein's voyage, and a map of the South Seas; and for rea&s;ons which may be &s;een at large in his work, &s;uppo&s;es him, after leaving Ea&s;ter I&s;land, which he places in latitude 28&frac12; S. longitude 123&deg; W. to have &s;teered S. W. as high as 34&deg; S. and afterwards W. N. W; and if this was indeed his rout, the proof that there is no main land to the northward of 35&deg; S. is irrefragable. Mr. Dalrymple indeed &s;uppo&s;es his rout to have been different, and that from Ea&s;ter I&s;le he &s;teered N. W. taking a cour&s;e afterwards very little different from that of La Maire; but I think it is highly improbable that a man, who at his own reque&s;t was &s;ent to di&s;cover a &s;outhern continent, &s;hould take a cour&s;e in which La Maire had already proved no continent could be found: it mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, that Roggewein's track cannot certainly be a&s;certained, becau&s;e in the accounts that have been publi&s;hed of his voyage, neither longitudes nor latitudes are mentioned. As to my&s;elf I &s;aw nothing that I thought a &s;ign of land, in my rout either to the northward, &s;outhward or we&s;tward, till a few days before I made the ea&s;t coa&s;t of New Zealand: I did indeed frequently &s;ee large flocks of birds, but they were generally &s;uch as are found at a very remote di&s;tance from any coa&s;t; and it is al&s;o true that I frequently &s;aw pieces of rock-weed, but I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> infer the vicinity of land from the&s;e, becau&s;e I have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|formed, upon indubitable authority, that a con&s;iderable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="44" REF="013324_0333_0F90F28E38C04648">
of the beans called <HI>ox-eyes,</HI> which are known to grow no|where but in the We&s;t-Indies, are every year thrown up on the coa&s;t of Ireland, which is not le&s;s than twelve hundred leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Thus have I given my rea&s;ons for thinking that there is no continent to the northward of latitude 40&deg; S.; of what may lie farther to the &s;outhward than 40&deg; I can give no opinion; but I am &s;o far from wi&s;hing to di&s;courage any future attempt, finally to determine a que&s;tion which has long been an object of attention to many nations; that now this voyage has re|duced the only po&s;&s;ible &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ite of a continent in the &s;outhern he|mi&s;phere, north of latitude 40&deg;, to &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace, I think it would be pity to leave that any longer unexamined, e&s;pe|cially as the voyage may turn to good account, be&s;ides deter|mining the principal que&s;tion, if no continent &s;hould be found, by the di&s;covery of new i&s;lands in the tropical regions, of which there is probably a great number, that no European ve&s;&s;el has ever yet vi&s;ited. Tupia from time to time gave us an ac|count of about one hundred and thirty, and in a chart drawn by his own hand, he actually laid down no le&s;s than &s;eventy-four.</P>

<P>HAVING &s;ailed from Cape Farewell, which lies in latitude 40:33 S. longitude 186 W. on Saturday the 31&s;t of March 1770, we &s;teered we&s;tward, with a fre&s;h gale at N. N.

<P><PB N="45" REF="013324_0334_0F90503A5C3B14D0">
In the morning of the 9th, being in latitude 38:29 S. we &s;aw a tropic bird, which in &s;o high a latitude is very uncom|mon.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 10th, being in latitude 38:51 S. longitude 202:43 W. we found the variation, by the ampli|tude, to be 11:25 E. and by the azimuth 11:20.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of the 13th, being in latitude 39:23 S. lon|gitude 204:2 W. I found the variation to be 12:27 E. and in the morning of the 14th, it was 11:30; this day we al&s;o &s;aw &s;ome flying fi&s;h. On the 15th, we &s;aw an egg bird and a gannet, and as the&s;e are birds that never go far from the land, we continued to &s;ound all night, but had no ground with 130 fathom. At noon on the 16th, we were in latitude 39:45 S. longitude 208&deg; W. At about two o'clock the wind came about to the W. S. W. upon which we tacked and &s;tood to the N.

At eight we wore and &s;tood to the &s;outhward till twelve at night, and then wore and &s;tood to the N. W. till four in the morning, when we again &s;tood to the &s;outhward, having a fre&s;h gale at W. S. W. with &s;qualls and dark weather till nine, when the weather became clear, and there being little wind, we had an oppor|tunity to take &s;everal ob&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, the mean re&s;ult of which gave 207:56 W. longitude: our lati|tude at noon was 39:36 S. We had now a hard gale from the &s;outhward, and a great &s;ea from the &s;ame quarter, which obliged us to run under our &s;ore-&s;ail and mizen all night, during which we &s;ounded every two hours, but had no ground with 120 fathom.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 18th, we &s;aw two Port Egmont hens, and a pintado bird, which are certain &s;igns of approaching land, and indeed by our reckoning we could not be far from it, for our longitude was now one degree to the we&s;tward, of the ea&s;t &s;ide of Van Diemen's land, according to the longitude laid down by Ta&s;man, whom we could not &s;uppo&s;e to have erred much in &s;o &s;hort a run as from this land to New Zealand, and by our latitude we could not be above fifty or fifty-five leagues from the place whence he took his departure. All this day we had frequent &s;qualls and a great &s;well. At one in the morning we brought to and &s;ounded, but had no ground with 130 fathom; at &s;ix we &s;aw land extending from N. E. to W. at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix leagues, having eighty fathom wa|ter, with a fine &s;andy bottom.</P>
<P>We continued &s;tanding we&s;tward, with the wind at S. S. W. till eight, when we made all the &s;ail we could, and bore away
<PB N="46" REF="013324_0335_0F90F28F0161CA50">
along the &s;hore N. E. for the ea&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight, being at this time in latitude 37:58 S. and longitude 210:39 W. The &s;outhermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight, which bore from us W. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">/4 S. I judged to lie in latitude 38&deg;, longitude 211:7, and gave it the name of POINT HICKS, becau&s;e Mr. Hicks, the Fir&s;t Lieutenant, was the fir&s;t who di&s;covered it. To the &s;outh|ward of this point no land was to be &s;een, though it was very clear in that quarter, and by our longitude, compared with that of Ta&s;man, not as it is laid down in the printed charts, but in the extracts from Ta&s;man's journal, publi&s;hed by Rembrant&s;e, the body of Van Diemen's land ought to have borne due &s;outh; and indeed, from the &s;udden falling of the &s;ea, after the wind abated, I had rea&s;on to think it did; yet as I did not &s;ee it, and as I found this coa&s;t trend N. E. and S. W. or rather more to the ea&s;tward, I cannot determine whether it joins to Van Diemen's land or not.</P>
<P>At noon, we were in latitude 37:50, longitude 210:29 W. The extreams of the land extended from N. W. to E. N. E. and a remarkable point bore N. 20&deg; E. at the di&s;tance of about four leagues. This point ri&s;es in a round hillock, very much re&s;embling the Ram Head, at the entrance of Plymouth Sound, and therefore I called it by the &s;ame name. The va|riation by an azimuth, taken this morning, was 3:7 E.; and what we had now &s;een of the land, appeared low and le|vel: the &s;ea &s;hore was a white &s;and, but the country within was green and woody. About one o'clock, we &s;aw three wa|ter &s;pouts at once; two were between us and the &s;hore, and the third at &s;ome di&s;tance, upon our larboard quarter: this phaenomenon is &s;o well known, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to give a particular de&s;cription of it here.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, we &s;hortened &s;ail, and brought to for the night, having fifty-&s;ix fathom water, and a fine &s;an|dy bottom. The northermo&s;t land in &s;ight then bore N. by E. &frac12; E. and a &s;mall i&s;land lying clo&s;e to a point on the main bore W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;tant two leagues. This point which I called CAPE HOWE, may be known by the trending of the coa&s;t, which is north on the one &s;ide, and &s;outh we&s;t on the other; it may al|&s;o be known by &s;ome round hills upon the main, ju&s;t within it.</P>
<P>We brought to for the night, and and at four in the morning made &s;ail along &s;hore to the northward. At &s;ix, the norther|mo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. N. W. and we were at this time about four leagues from the &s;hore. At noon, we were in la|titude 36:51 S. longitude 209:53 W. and about three leagues di&s;tant from the &s;hore. The weather being clear, gave us a good view of the country, which has a very plea&s;ing ap|pearance: it is of a moderate height, diver&s;ified by hills and vallies, ridges and plains, inter&s;per&s;ed with a few lawns of no great extent, but in general covered with wood: the a&s;cent of
<PB N="47" REF="013324_0336_0F90F28FCBF4BEC8">
the hills and ridges is gentle, and the &s;ummits are not high. We continued to &s;ail along the &s;hore to the northward, with a &s;outherly wind, and in the afternoon we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;e|veral places, by which we knew the country to be inhabited. At &s;ix in the evening we &s;hortened &s;ail, and &s;ounded: we found forty-four fathom water, with a clear &s;andy bottom, and &s;tood on under an ea&s;y &s;ail till twelve, when we brought to for the night, and had ninety fathom water.</P>
<P>At four in the morning we made &s;ail again, at the di&s;|tance of about five leagues from the land, and at &s;ix, we were abrea&s;t of a high mountain, lying near the &s;hore, which, on account of its figure, I called MOUNT DROMEDARY: under this mountain the &s;hore forms a point, to which I gave the name of POINT DROMEDARY, and over it there is a peaked hillock. At this time, being in latitude 36:18 S. longitude 209:55 W. we found the variation to be 10:42 E.</P>
<P>Between ten and eleven, Mr. Green and I took &s;everal ob|&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, the mean re&s;ult of which gave 209:17 longitude W. By an ob&s;ervation made the day be|fore, our longitude was 210:9 W. from which, 20 being &s;ub|tracted, there remains 209:49, the longitude of the &s;hip this day at noon, the mean of which, with this day's ob&s;ervation, gives 209:33, by which I fix the longitude of this coa&s;t. At noon, our latitude was 35:49 S. Cape Dromedary bore S. 30 W. at the di&s;tance of twelve leagues, and an open bay, in which were three or four &s;mall i&s;lands, bore N. W. by W. at the di&s;tance of five or fix leagues. This bay &s;eemed to af|ford but little &s;helter from the &s;ea winds, and yet it is the only place where there appeared a probability of finding anchorage upon the whole coa&s;t. We continued to &s;teer along the &s;hore N. by E. and N. N. E. at the di&s;tance of about three leagues, and &s;aw &s;moke in many places near the beach. At five in the evening, we were abrea&s;t of a point of land which ro&s;e in a perpendicular cliff, and which, for that rea&s;on, I called POINT UPRIGHT. Our latitude was 35:35 S. when this Point bore from us due we&s;t, di&s;tant about two leagues; in this &s;i|tuation, we had about thirty-one fathom water, with a &s;andy bottom. At &s;ix in the evening, the wind falling, we hauled off E. N. E. and at this time the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. by E. &frac12; E. At midnight, being in &s;eventy fathom water, we brought to till four in the morning, when we made &s;ail in for the land; but at day break, found our &s;ituation nearly the &s;ame as it had been at five in the evening before, by which it was apparent that we had been driven about three leagues to the &s;outhward, by a tide or current during the night. After this we &s;teered along the &s;hore N. N. E. with a gentle breeze at S. W. and were &s;o near the land as to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;e|veral of the natives upon the beach, who appeared to be of a
<PB N="48" REF="013324_0337_0F90F29075A26860">
black, or very dark colour. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;er|vation, was 35:27 S. and longitude 209:23 W. Cape Dromedary bore S. 28 W. di&s;tant nineteen leagues, a re|markable peaked hill, which re&s;embled a &s;quare dove-hou&s;e, with a dome at the top, and which for that rea&s;on I called the PIGEON HOUSE, bore N. 32:30 W. and a &s;mall low i&s;land, which lay clo&s;e under the &s;hore, bore N. W. di&s;tant about two or three leagues. When I fir&s;t di&s;covered this i&s;land, in the morning, I was in hopes, from its appearance, that I &s;hould have found &s;helter for the &s;hip behind it, but when we came near it, it did not promi&s;e &s;ecurity even for the landing of a boat: I &s;hould however have attempted to &s;end a boat on &s;hore, if the wind had not veered to that direction, with a large hollow &s;ea rolling in upon the land from the S. E. which indeed had been the ca&s;e ever &s;ince we had been upon it. The coa&s;t &s;till continued to be of a moderate height, forming alter|nately rocky points and &s;andy beaches; but within, between Mount Dromedary, and the Pigeon Hou&s;e, we &s;aw high mountains, which, except two, are covered with wood: the&s;e two lie inland, behind the Pigeon Hou&s;e, and are re|markably flat at the top, with &s;teep rocky cliffs all round them, as far as we could &s;ee. The trees which almo&s;t every where clothe this country, appear to be large and lofty. This day the variation was found to be 9:50 E. and for the two la&s;t days, the latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was twelve or fourteen miles to the &s;outhward of the &s;hip's account, which could have been the effect of nothing but a current &s;etting in that direc|tion. About four in the afternoon, being near five leagues from the land, we tacked and &s;tood off S. E. and E. and the wind having veered in the night, from E. to N. E. and N. we tacked about four in the morning, and &s;tood in, being then about nine or ten leagues from the &s;hore. At eight, the wind began to die away, and &s;oon after it was calm. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 35:38, and our di&s;tance from the land about &s;ix leagues. Cape Dromedary bore S. 37 W. di&s;tant &s;eventeen leagues, and the Pigeon Hou&s;e N. 40 W. In this &s;ituation we had &s;eventy-four fathom water. In the after|noon we had variable light airs and calms, till &s;ix in the even|ing, when a breeze &s;prung up at N. by W.: at this time, being about four or five leagues from the &s;hore, we had &s;even|ty fathom water. The Pigeon Hou&s;e bore N. 45 W. Mount Dromedary S. 30 W. and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight N. 19 E.</P>
<P>We &s;tood to the north ea&s;t till noon the next day, with a gentle breeze at N. W. and then we tacked and &s;tood we&s;tward. At this time, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 35:10 S. and longitude 208:51 W. A point of land which I had di&s;cover|ed on St. George's day, and which therefore I called CAPE
<PB N="49" REF="013324_0338_0F8FFB8E8B379CD0">
GEORGE, bore W. di&s;tant nineteen miles, and the Pigeon Hou&s;e, (the latitude and longitude of which I found to be 35:19 S. and 209:42 W.) S. 75 W. In the morning, we had found the variation, by amplitude, to be 7:50 E. and by &s;e|veral azimuths 7:54 E. We had a fre&s;h breeze at N. W. from noon till three; it then came to the we&s;t, when we tacked and &s;tood to the northward. At five in the evening, being about five or &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore, with the Pigeon Hou&s;e bearing W. S. W. di&s;tant about nine leagues, we had eighty-&s;ix fathom water; and at eight, having thunder and lightning, with heavy &s;qualls, we brought to in 120 fathom.</P>
<P>At three in the morning, we made &s;ail again to the north|ward, having the advantage of a fre&s;h gale at S. W. At noon, we were about three or four leagues from the &s;hore, and in latitude 34:22 S. longitude 208:36 W. In the cour&s;e of this day's run from the preceding noon, which was forty-five miles north ea&s;t, we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places near the beach. About two leagues to the northward of Cape George, the &s;hore &s;eemed to form a bay, which pro|mi&s;ed &s;helter from the north ea&s;t winds, but as the wind was with us, it was not in my power to look into it without beating up, which would have co&s;t me more time than I was willing to &s;pare. The north point of this bay, on account of its figure, I named LONG NOSE; its latitude is 35:6, and about eight leagues north of it there lies a point; which, from the colour of the land about it, I called RED POINT: its latitude is 34:29, and longitude 208:45 W. To the north we&s;t of Red Point, and a little way inland, &s;tands a round hill, the top of which looks like the crown of a hat. In the after|noon of this day, we had a light breeze at N. N. W. till five in the evening, when it fell calm: at this time, we were be|tween three and four leagues from the &s;hore, and had forty-eight fathom water: the variation by azimuth was 8:48 E. and the extremities of this land were from N. E. by N. to S. W. by S. Before it was dark, we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places along the &s;hore, and a fire two or three times afterwards. During the night we lay becalmed, driving in before the &s;ea till one in the morning, when we got a breeze from the land, with which we &s;teered N. E. being then in thirty-eight fathom. At noon, it veered to the N. E. by N. and we were then in latitude 34:10 S. longitude 208:27 W.: the land was di&s;tant about five leagues, and extended from S. 37 W. to N. &frac12; E. In this latitude, there are &s;ome white cliffs, which ri&s;e perpendicularly from the &s;ea to a con&s;iderable height. We &s;tood off the &s;hore till two o'clock, and then tacked and &s;tood in till &s;ix, when we were within four or five miles of it, and at that di&s;tance had fifty fathom water. The extremities of the land bore from S. 28 W. to N. 25:30 E. We now
<PB N="50" REF="013324_0339_0F90F2914A913EF8">
tacked and &s;tood off till twelve, then tacked and &s;tood in again till four in the morning, when we made a trip off till day light; and during all this time we lo&s;t ground, owing to the variable|ne&s;s of the winds. We continued at the di&s;tance of between four and five miles from the &s;hore, till the afternoon, when we came within two miles, and I then hoi&s;ted out the pinnace and yawl to attempt a landing, but the pinnace proved to be &s;o leaky that I was obliged to hoi&s;t her in again. At this time we &s;aw &s;everal of the natives walking bri&s;kly along the &s;hore, four of whom carried a &s;mall canoe upon their &s;houlders: we flattered our&s;elves that they were going to put her into the water, and come off to the &s;hip, but finding our&s;elves di&s;ap|pointed, I determined to go on &s;hore in the yawl, with as many as it would carry: I embarked therefore, only with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and four rowers: we pulled for that part of the &s;hore where the Indians appeared, near which four &s;mall canoes were lying at the water't edge. The Indians &s;at down upon the rocks, and &s;eemed to wait for our landing; but to our great regret, when we came within about a quarter of a mile, they ran away into the woods: we determined however to go a&s;hore, and endeavour to procure an interview, but in this we were again di&s;appointed, for we found &s;o great a &s;urf beating upon every part of the beach, that landing with our little boat was altogether impracticable: we were there|fore obliged to be content with gazing at &s;uch objects as pre|&s;ented them&s;elves from the water: the canoes, upon a near view, &s;eemed very much to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the &s;maller &s;ort at New Zealand. We ob&s;erved, that among the trees on &s;hore, which were not very large, there was no underwood; and could di&s;tingui&s;h that many of them were of the palm kind, and &s;ome of them cabbage trees: after many a wi&s;hful look we were obliged to return, with our curio&s;ity rather excited than &s;atisfied, and about five in the evening got on board the &s;hip. About this time it fell calm, and our &s;ituation was by no means agreeable: we wete now not more than a mile and a half from the &s;hore, and within &s;ome breakers, which lay to the &s;outh|ward; but happily a light breeze came off the land, and car|ried us out of danger: with this breeze we &s;tood to the north|ward, and at day-break we di&s;covered a bay, which &s;eemed to be well &s;heltered from all winds, and into which, therefore, I determined to go with the &s;hip. The pinnace being repair|ed, I &s;ent her, with the Ma&s;ter, to &s;ound the entrance, while I kept turning up, having the wind right out. At noon, the mouth of the bay bore N. N. W. di&s;tant about a mile, and &s;e|ing a &s;moke on the &s;hore, we directed our gla&s;&s;es to the &s;pot, and &s;oon di&s;covered ten people, who, upon our nearer approach, left their fire, and retired to a little eminence, whence they could conveniently ob&s;erve our motions. Soon after two ca|noes,
<PB N="51" REF="013324_0340_0F8FFB8F907B9EA8">
each having two men on board, came to the &s;hore, ju&s;t under the eminence, and the men joined the le&s;t on the top it. The pinnace, which had been &s;ent a head to &s;ound, now ap|proached the place, upon which all the Indians retired farther up the hill, except one, who hid him&s;elf among &s;ome rocks, near the landing-place. As the pinnace proceeded along the &s;hore, mo&s;t of the people took the &s;ame route, and kept abrea&s;t of her at a di&s;tance: when &s;he came back, the ma&s;ter told us, that in a cove, a little within the harbour, &s;ome of them had come down to the beach, and invited him to land by many &s;igns and words, of which he knew not the meaning; but that all of them were armed with long pikes, and a wooden weapon, &s;haped &s;omewhat like a cimeter. The Indians who had not followed the boat, &s;eeing the &s;hip approach, u&s;ed many threat|ening ge&s;tures, and brandi&s;hed their weapons; particularly two, who made a very &s;ingular appearance, for their faces &s;eemed to have been du&s;ted with a white powder, and their bodies painted with broad &s;treakes of the &s;ame colour, which, pa&s;&s;ing obliquely over their brea&s;ts and backs, looked not un|like the cro&s;s-belts worn by our &s;oldiers; the &s;ame kind of &s;treaks were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> drawn round their legs and thighs, like broad garters: each of the&s;e men held in his hand the weapen that had been de&s;cribed to us as like a cimeter, which appeared to be about two feet and a half long, and they &s;eemed to talk to each other with great earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand into the bay, and early in the after|noon anchored under the &s;outh &s;hore, about two miles with|in the entrance, in &s;ix fathom water, the &s;outh point bearing S. E. and the north point Ea&s;t. As we came in we &s;aw, on both points of the bay, a few huts, and &s;evetal of the natives, men, women, and children. Under the &s;outh head we &s;aw four &s;mall canoes, with each one man on board, who were very bu&s;ily employed in &s;triking fi&s;h with a long pike or &s;pear; they ventured almo&s;t into the &s;urf, and were &s;o intent upon what they were doing, that although the &s;hip pa&s;&s;ed within a quarter of a mile of them, they &s;carcely turned their eyes towards her; po&s;&s;ibly being deafened by the &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f, and their attention wholly fixed upon their bu&s;ine&s;s or &s;port, they neither &s;aw nor heard her go pa&s;t them.</P>
<P>The place where the &s;hip had anchored was abrea&s;t of a &s;mall village, con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ix or eight hou&s;es; and while we were preparing to hoi&s;t out the boat, we &s;aw an old woman, followed by three children, come out of the wood; &s;he was loaded with fire-wood, and each of the children had al&s;o its little burden: when &s;he came to the hou&s;es three more child|ren, younger than the others, came out to meet her: &s;he of|ten looked at the &s;hip, but expre&s;&s;ed neither fear nor &s;urpri&s;e: In a &s;hort time &s;he kindled a fire, and the four canoes came in
<PB N="52" REF="013324_0341_0F90503AE36F5D88">
from fi&s;hing. The men landed, and having hauled up their boats, began to dre&s;s their dinner, to all appearance wholly unconcerned about us, though we were within half a mile of them. We thought it remarkable that of all the people we had yet &s;een, not one had the lea&s;t appearance of clothing, the old woman her&s;elf being de&s;titute even of a fig-l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">.</P>
<P>After dinner the boats were manned, and we &s;et out from the &s;hip, having Tupia of our party. We intended to land where we &s;aw the people, and began to hope that as they had &s;o little regarded the &s;hip's coming into the bay, they would as little regard our coming on &s;hore; in this, however, we were di&s;appointed; for as &s;oon as we approached the rocks, two of the men came down upon them to di&s;pute our landing, and the re&s;t ran away. Each of the two champions was armed with a lance, about ten feet long, and a &s;hort &s;tick, which he &s;eemed to handle as if it was a machine to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in managing or throwing the lance: they called to us in a very loud tone, and in a har&s;h di&s;&s;onant language, of which neither we nor Tupia under&s;tood a &s;ingle word: they brandi&s;hed their weapons, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to defend their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;t to the ut|termo&s;t, though they were but two, and we were forty. I could not but admire their courage, and being very unwilling that ho&s;tilities &s;hould commence with &s;uch inequality of force between us, I ordered the boat to lie upon her oars: we then parlied by &s;igns for about a quarter of an hour, and to be&s;pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their good-will, I threw them nails, beads, and other trifles, which they took up and &s;eemed to be well plea&s;ed with. I then made &s;igns that I wanted water, and by all the means that I could devi&s;e, endeavoured to convince that we would do them no harm: they now waved to us, and I was willing to interpret it as an invitation; but upon our putting the boat in, they came again to oppo&s;e us. One appeared to be a youth about nineteen or twenty, and the other a man of middle age: as I had now no other re&s;ource I fired a mu&s;ket between them. Upon the report, the younge&s;t dropped a bundle of lances upon the rock, but recollecting him&s;elf in an in&s;tant he &s;natched them up again with great ha&s;te: a &s;tone was then thrown at us, upon which I ordered a mu&s;quet to be fired with &s;mall &s;hot, which &s;truck the elde&s;t upon the legs, and he immediately ran to one of the hou&s;es, which was di&s;tant about an hundred yards: I now hoped that our conte&s;t was over, and we immediately landed; but we had &s;carcely left the boat when he returned, and we then perceived that he had left the rock only to fetch a &s;hield or target for his defence. As &s;oon as he came up, he threw a lance at us, and his comrade an|other; they fell where we &s;tood thicke&s;t, but happily hurt no|body. A third mu&s;quet with &s;mall &s;hot was then fired at them, upon which one of them threw another lance, and both imme|diately
<PB N="53" REF="013324_0342_0F90F292076858D8">
ran away: if we had pur&s;ued, we might probably have taken one of them; but Mr. Banks &s;ugge&s;ting that the lances might be poi&s;oned, I thought it not prudent to venture into the woods. We repaired immediately to the huts, in one of which we found the children, who had hidden them&s;elves behind a &s;hield and &s;ome bark; we peeped at them, but left them in their retreat, without their knowing that they had been di&s;covered, and we threw into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hou&s;e, when we went away, &s;ome beads, ribbons, pieces of cloth, and other pre&s;ents, which we hoped would procure us the good-will of the inha|bitants when they &s;hould return; but the lances which we found lying about, we took away with us, to the number of about fif|ty: they were from &s;ix to fifteen feet long, and all of them had four prongs in the manner of a fi&s;h-gig, each of which was pointed with fi&s;h-bone, and very &s;harp: we ob&s;erved that they were &s;meared with a vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance of a green colour, which favoured the opinion of their being poi&s;oned, though we afterwards di&s;covered that it was a mi&s;take: they appeared by the &s;ea-weed that we found &s;ticking to them, to have been u&s;ed in &s;triking fi&s;h. Upon examining the canoes that lay upon the beach, we found them to be the wor&s;t we had ever &s;een: they were between twelve and fourteen feet long, and made of the bark of a tree, in one piece, which was drawn to|gether, and tied up at each end, the middle being kept open by &s;ticks, which were placed acro&s;s them from gunwale to gunwale, as thwarts. We then &s;earched for fre&s;h water, but found none, except in a &s;mall hole which had been dug in the &s;and.</P>
<P>Having reimbarked in our boat, we depo&s;ited our lances on board the &s;hip, and then went over to the north point of the bay, where we had &s;een &s;everal of the inhabitants when we were entering it, but which we now found totally de&s;erted. Here however we found fre&s;h water, which trickled down from the top of the rocks, and &s;tood in pools among the hollows at the bottom; but it was &s;ituated &s;o as not to be procured for our u&s;e without difficulty.</P>
<P>In the morning, therefore, I &s;ent a party of men to that part of the &s;hore where we fir&s;t landed, with orders to dig holes in the &s;and, where the water might gather; but upon going a&s;hore my&s;elf with the Gentlemen &s;oon afterwards, we found, upon a more diligent &s;earch, a &s;mall &s;tream, more than &s;uf|ficient for our purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon vi&s;iting the hut, where we had &s;een the children, we were greatly mortified to find that the beads and ribbons which we had left there the night before, had not been moved from their places, and that not an Indian was to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Having &s;ent &s;ome empty water ca&s;ks on &s;hore, and left a par|ty of men to cut wood, I my&s;elf went in the pinnace to
<PB N="54" REF="013324_0343_0F90F292BA91D1F8">
&s;ound, and examine the bay; during my excur&s;ion I &s;aw &s;eve|ral of the natives, but they all fled at my approach. In one of the places where I landed I found &s;everal &s;mall fires, and fre&s;h mu&s;cles broiling upon them; here al&s;o I found &s;ome of the larg|e&s;t oy&s;ter-&s;hells I had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the wooders and waterers came on board to din|ner, ten or twelve of the natives came down to the place, and looked with great attention and curio&s;ity at the ca&s;ks, but did not touch them: they took away however the canoes, which lay near the landing-place, and again di&s;appeared. In the af|ternoon, when our people were again a&s;hore, &s;ixteen or eigh|teen Indians, all armed, came boldly within about an hundred yards of them, and then &s;topped: two of them advanced &s;ome|what nearer; and Mr. Hicks, who commanded the party on &s;hore, with another, advanced to meet them, holding out pre|&s;ents to them as he approached, and expre&s;&s;ing kindne&s;s and amity by every &s;ign he could think of, but all without effect; for before he could get up with them they retired, and it would have an&s;wered no purpo&s;e to pur&s;ue. In the evening I went with Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, to a &s;andy cove, on the north &s;ide of the bay, where, in three or four hauls with the &s;eine, we took above three hundred weight of fi&s;h, which was equally divided among the &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>The next morning, before day-break, the Indians came down to the hou&s;es that were abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, and were heard frequently to &s;hout very loud. As &s;oon as it was light, they were &s;een walking along the beach; and &s;oon after they re|tired to the woods, where, at the di&s;tance of about a mile from the &s;hore, they kindled &s;everal fires.</P>
<P>Our people went a&s;hore as u&s;ual, and with them Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, who, in &s;earch, of plants, repaired to the woods. Our men, who were employed in cutting gra&s;s, being the farthe&s;t removed from the main body of the people, a company of 14 or 15 Indians advanced towards them, having &s;ticks in their hands, which, according to the report of the Serjeant of the marines, &s;hone like a mu&s;quet. The gra&s;s-cutters, upon &s;eeing them approach, drew together, and repaired to the main body. The Indians, being encouraged by this ap|pearance of a flight, pur&s;ued them; they &s;topped however when they were within about a furlong of them, and after &s;houting &s;everal times went back into the woods. In the even|ing they came again in the &s;ame manner, &s;topped at the &s;ame di&s;tance, &s;houted and retired. I followed them my&s;elf, alone and unarmed, for a con&s;iderable way along the &s;hore, but I could not prevail upon them to &s;top.</P>
<P>This day Mr. Green took the &s;un's meridian altitude, a little within the &s;outh entrance of the bay, which gave the latitude 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> S. the variation of the needle was 11:3 E.</P>

Early the next morning, the body of Forby Sutherland, one of our &s;eamen, who died the evening before, was buried near the watering-place; and from this incident I called the &s;outh point of this bay SUTHERI AND POINT. This day we re&s;olved to make an excur&s;ion into the country. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, my&s;elf, and &s;even others, properly accoutred for the expedition, &s;et out, and repaired fir&s;t to the huts, near the watering place, whither &s;ome of the natives continued every day to re&s;ort; and though the little pre&s;ents which we had left there before had not yet been taken away, we left others of &s;omewhat more value, con&s;i&s;ting of cloth, looking gla&s;&s;es, combs, and beads, and then went up into the country. We found the &s;oil to be either &s;wamp or light &s;and, and the face of the country finely diver&s;ified by wood and lawn. The trees are tall, &s;trait, and without underwood, &s;tanding at &s;uch a di&s;tance from each other that the whole country, at lea&s;t where the &s;wamps do not render it incapable of cultivation, might be cultivated without cutting down one of them: between the trees the ground is covered with gra&s;s, of which there is great abundance, growing in tufts about as big as can well be gra&s;ped in the hand, which &s;tand very clo&s;e to each other. We &s;aw many hou&s;es of the inhabitants, and places where they had &s;lept upon the gra&s;s without any &s;helter; but we &s;aw only one of the people, who, the moment he di&s;covered us, ran away. At all the&s;e places we left pre&s;ents, hoping that at length they might produce confidence and good will. We had a tran&s;ient and imperfect view of a quadruped, about as big as a rabbit: Mr. Banks's greyhound, which was with us, got &s;ight of it, and would probably have caught it, but the moment he &s;et off he lamed him&s;elf, again&s;t a &s;tump which lay concealed in the long gra&s;s. We afterwards &s;aw the dung of an animal which fed upon gra&s;s, and which we judged could not be le&s;s than a deer; and the foot&s;teps of another, which was clawed like a dog, and &s;eemed to be about as big as a wolf: we al&s;o tracked a &s;mall animal, who&s;e foot re&s;embled that of a polcat, or wea&s;el. The trees over our head abounded with birds of various kinds, among which were many of ex|qui&s;ite beauty, particularly loriquets, and cockatoos, which flew in flocks of &s;everal &s;cores together. We found &s;ome wood which had been felled by the natives, with a blunt in&s;trument, and &s;ome that had been barked. The trees were not of many &s;pecies; among others there was a large one which yielded a gum not unlike the <HI>Sanguis draconis;</HI> and in &s;ome of them &s;teps had been cut at about three feet di&s;tance from each other, for the convenience of climbing them.</P>
<P>From this excur&s;ion we returned between three and four o'clock, and having dined on board, we went a&s;hore again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the watering place, where a party of men were filling ca&s;k
<PB N="56" REF="013324_0345_0F90EC9EAF6813F0">
Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, had been &s;ent out in the morning with a boat to dredge for oy&s;ters, at the head of the bay; when he had performed this &s;ervice, he went a&s;hore, and having taken a mid&s;hipman with him, and &s;ent the boat away, &s;et out to join the waterers by land. In his way he fell in with a body of two and twenty Indians, who followed him, and were often not more than twenty yards di&s;tance; when Mr. Gore perceived them &s;o near, he &s;topped, and faced about, upon which they &s;topped al&s;o; and when he went on again, continued their pur&s;uit: they did not however attack him, though they were all armed with lances, and he and the mid|&s;hipman got in &s;afety to the watering-place. The Indians, who had &s;lackened their pur&s;uit when they came in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of the main body of our people, halted at about the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile, where they &s;tood &s;till. Mr. Monkhou&s;e and two or three of the waterers took it in their head to march up to them; but &s;eeing the Indians keep their ground, till they came pretty near them, they were &s;eized with a &s;udden fear, very common to the ra&s;h and fool-hardy, and made a ha&s;ty re|treat: this &s;tep, which in&s;ured the danger that it was taken to avoid, encouraged the Indians, and four of them running for|ward, di&s;charged their lances at the fugitives, with &s;uch force that, flying no le&s;s than forty yards, they went beyond them. As the Indians did not pur&s;ue, our people, recovering their &s;pirits, &s;topped to collect the lances, when they came to the place where they lay; upon which the Indians, in their turn, began to retire. Ju&s;t at this time I came up, with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia; and being de&s;irous to convince the Indians that we were neither afraid of them, nor intended them any mi&s;chief, we advanced towards them, making &s;igns of expo&s;tulation and entreaty, but they could not be per&s;uaded to wait till we could come up. Mr. Gore told us, that he had &s;een &s;ome of them up the bay, who had invited him by &s;igns to come on &s;hore, which he, certainly with great prudence, declined.</P>
<P>The morning of the next day was &s;o rainy, that we were all glad to &s;tay on board. In the afternoon, however, it cleared up, and we made another excur&s;ion along the &s;ea coa&s;t to the &s;outhward: we went a&s;hore, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander gathered many plants; but be&s;ides the&s;e we &s;aw nothing wor|thy of notice. At our fir&s;t entering the woods, we met with three of the natives, who in&s;tantly ran away: more of them were &s;een by &s;ome of the people, but they all di&s;appeared, with great precipitation, as &s;oon as they found that they were di&s;|covered. By the boldne&s;s of the&s;e people at our fir&s;t landing, and the terror that &s;eized them at the &s;ight of us afterwards, it appears that they were &s;ufficiently intimidated by our fire-arms: not that we had any rea&s;on to think the people much hurt by
<PB N="57" REF="013324_0346_0F90F2944B232A70">
the &s;mall &s;hot which we were obliged to fire at them, when they attacked us at our coming out of the boat; but they had probably &s;een the effects of them, from their lurking-places, upon the birds that we had &s;hot. Tupia, who was now be|come a good mark&s;man, frequently &s;trayed from us to &s;hoot parrots; and he had told us, that while he was thus employed, he had once met with nine Indians, who, as &s;oon as they per|ceived he &s;aw them, ran from him, in great confu&s;ion and terror.</P>
<P>The next day, twelve canoes, in each of which was a &s;ingle Indian, came towards the watering place, and were within half a mile of it a con&s;iderable time: they were employed in &s;triking fi&s;h, upon which, like others that we had &s;een before, they were &s;o intent, that they &s;eemed to regard nothing el&s;e. It happened, however, that a party of our people were out a &s;hooting near the place, and one of the men, who&s;e curio&s;ity might at length perhaps be rou&s;ed by the report of the fowling pieces, was ob&s;erved by Mr. Banks to haul up his canoe, upon the beach, and go towards the &s;hooting party: in &s;omething more than a quarter of an hour he returned, launched his ca|noe, and went off in her to his companions. This incident makes it probable that the natives acquired a knowledge of the de&s;tructive power of our fire arms, when we knew nothing of the matter; for this man was not &s;een by any of the party who&s;e operations he had reconnoitred.</P>
<P>While Mr. Banks was gathering plants near the watering-place, I went with Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhou&s;e to the head of the bay, that I might examine that part of the country, and make farther attempts to form &s;ome connection with the natives. In our way we met with eleven or twelve &s;mall ca|noes, with each a man in it, probably the &s;ame that were after|wards abrea&s;t of the &s;hore, who all made into &s;hoal water upon our approach. We met other Indians on &s;hore the fir&s;t time we landed, who in&s;tantly took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their canoes, and paddled away.</P>
<P>We went up the country to &s;ome di&s;tance, and found the face of it nearly the &s;ame with that which has been de&s;cribed already, but the &s;oil was much richer; for in&s;tead of &s;and, I found a deep black mould, which I thought very fit for the production of grain of any kind. In the woods we found a tree which bore fruit that in colour and &s;hape re&s;embled a cherry; the juice had an agreeable tartne&s;s, though but little flavour. We found al&s;o inter&s;per&s;ed &s;ome of the fine&s;t meadows in the world; &s;ome places however were rocky, but the&s;e were com|paratively few: the &s;tone is &s;andy, and might be u&s;ed with advantage for building. When we returned to the boat, we &s;aw &s;ome &s;moke upon another part of the coa&s;t, and went thi|ther in hopes of meeting with the people, but at our approach, the&s;e al&s;o ran away. We found &s;ix &s;mall canoes, and &s;ix fires
<PB N="58" REF="013324_0347_0F90F294F872C288">
very near the beach, with &s;ome mu&s;cles roa&s;ting upon them, and a few oy&s;ters lying near: by this we judged that there had been one man in each canoe, who having picked up &s;ome &s;hell-fi&s;h had come a&s;hore to eat it, and that each made his &s;eparate fire for that purpo&s;e: we ta&s;ted of their cheer, and left them, in return, &s;ome &s;trings of beads, and other things which we thought would plea&s;e them. At the foot of a tree in this place we found a &s;mall well of fre&s;h water, &s;upplied by a &s;pring; and the day being now far &s;pent, we returned to the &s;hip. In the evening, Mr. Banks made a little excur&s;ion with his gun, and found &s;uch a number of quails, re&s;embling tho&s;e in England, that he might have &s;hot as many as he plea&s;ed; but his object was variety and not number.</P>
<P>The next morning, as the wind would not permit me to fail, I &s;ent out &s;everal parties into the country, to try again whether &s;ome intercour&s;e could not be e&s;tabli&s;hed with the na|tives. A mid&s;hipman, who belonged to one of the&s;e parties, having &s;traggled a long way from his companions, met with a very old man and woman, and &s;ome little children; they were &s;itting under a tree by the water &s;ide, and neither party &s;aw the other till they were clo&s;e together: the Indians &s;hewed &s;igns of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear, but did not attempt to run away. The man happened to have nothing to give them but a parrot that he had &s;hot; this he offered, but they refu&s;ed to accept it, withdrawing them&s;elves from his hand, either through fear or aver&s;ion. His &s;tay with them was but &s;hort, for he &s;aw &s;everal canoes near the beach a fi&s;hing, and being alone, he feared they might come a&s;hore, and attack him: he &s;aid, that the&s;e people were very dark coloured, but not black; that the man and woman appeared to be very old, being both grey-headed; that the hair of the man's head was bu&s;hy, and his beard long and rough; that the woman's hair was cropped &s;hort, and both of them were &s;tark naked. Mr. Monkhou&s;e the &s;urgeon, and one of the men, who were with another party near the watering-place, al&s;o &s;trayed from their companions, and as they were coming out of a thicket, ob&s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Indians &s;tanding together, at the di&s;tance of about fifty yards. One of them pronounced a word very loud, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;ignal, for a lance was immediately thrown at him out of the wood, which very narrowly mi&s;&s;ed him. When the Indians &s;aw that the weapon had not taken effect, they ran away with the greate&s;t precipitation; but on turning about towards the place whence the lance had been thrown, he &s;aw a young Indian, whom he judged to be about nineteen or twenty years old, come down from a tree, and he al&s;o ran away with &s;uch &s;peed as made it hopele&s;s to follow him. Mr. Monkhou&s;e was of opinion that he had been watched by the&s;e Indians, in his pa&s;&s;age through the thicket, and that
<PB N="59" REF="013324_0348_0F90F295C5FFC440">
the youth had been &s;tationed in the tree, to di&s;charge the lance at him, upon a &s;ignal as he &s;hould come by; but however this be, there could be no doubt but that he was the per&s;on who threw the lance.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, I went my&s;elf with a party over to the north &s;hore, and while &s;ome of our people were hauling the &s;eine, we made an excur&s;ion a few miles into the country, proceeding afterwards in the direction of the coa&s;t. We found this place without wood, and &s;omewhat re&s;embling our moors in England; the &s;urface of the ground, however, was covered with a thin bru&s;h of plants, about as high as the knees: the hills near the coa&s;t are low, but others ri&s;e behind them, increa&s;ing by a gradual a&s;cent, to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, with mar&s;hes and mora&s;&s;es between. When we re|turned to the boat, we found that our people had caught with the &s;eine a great number of &s;mall fi&s;h, which are well known in the We&s;t-Indies, and which our &s;ailors call Leather jackets, becau&s;e their &s;kin is remarkably thick. I had &s;ent the Second Lieutenant out in the yawl a &s;triking, and when we got back to the &s;hip, we found that he had al&s;o been very &s;ucce&s;sful. He had ob&s;erved that the large &s;ting-rays, of which there is great plenty in the bay, followed the flowing tide into very &s;hallow water; he therefore took the opportunity of flood, and &s;truck &s;everal in not more than two or three feet water: one of them weighed no le&s;s than two hundred and forty pounds after his entrails were taken out.</P>
<P>The next morning, as the wind &s;till continued northerly, I &s;ent out the yawl again, and the people &s;truck one &s;till larger, for when his entrails were taken out, he weighed three hundred and thirty-&s;ix pounds.</P>
<P>The great quantity of plants which Mr. Banks and Dr. So|lander collected in this place induced me to give it the name of BOTANY BAY. It is &s;ituated in the latitude of 34&deg; S. lon|gitude 208:37 W. It is capacious, &s;afe, and convenient, and may be known by the land on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, which is near|ly level, and of a moderate height; in general higher than it is farther inland, with &s;teep rocky cliffs next the &s;ea, which have the appearance of a long i&s;land, lying clo&s;e under the &s;hore. The harbour lies about the middle of this land, and in approaching it from the &s;outhward, is di&s;covered before the &s;hip comes abrea&s;t of it; but from the northward it is not di&s;|covered &s;o &s;oon: the entrance is a little more than a quarter of a mile broad, and lies in W. N. W. To &s;ail into it the &s;outhern &s;hore &s;hould be kept on board, till the &s;hip is within a &s;mall bare i&s;land, which lies clo&s;e under the north &s;hore; within this i&s;land the deepe&s;t water on that &s;ide is &s;even fa|thom, &s;hallowing to five a good way up. At a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;outh &s;hore there is a &s;hoal, reaching from
<PB N="60" REF="013324_0349_0F90F296727AED88">
the inner &s;outh point, quite to the head of the harbour; but over towards the north and north we&s;t &s;hore there is a channel of twelve or fourteen feet at low water, for three or four leagues, up to a place where there is three or four fathom, but here I fonnd very little fre&s;h water. We anchored near the &s;outh &s;hore, about a mile within the entrance, for the convenience of &s;ailing with a &s;outherly wind, and becau&s;e I thought it the be&s;t &s;ituation for watering; but I afterwards &s;ound a very fine &s;tream on the north &s;hore, in the fir&s;t &s;andy cove within the i&s;land, before which a &s;hip might lie almo&s;t land-locked, and procure wood as well as water in great abundance. Wood in|deed is every where plenty, but I &s;aw only two kinds which may be con&s;idered as timber. The&s;e trees are as large, or larger than the Engli&s;h oak, and one of them has not a very different appearance: this is the &s;ame that yields the red|di&s;h gum like <HI>&s;anguis draconis,</HI> and the wood is heavy, hard, and dark-coloured, like <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">:</HI> the other grows tall and &s;trait, &s;omething like the pine; and the wood of this, which has &s;ome re&s;emblance to the live oak of America, is al|&s;o hard and heavy. There are a few &s;hrubs, and &s;everal kinds of the palm; mangroves al&s;o grow in great plenty near the head of the bay. The country in general is level, low, and woody, as far as we could &s;ee. The woods, as I have before ob&s;erved, abound with birds of exqui&s;ite beauty, particularly of the parrot kind; we found al&s;o crows here, exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e in England. About the head of the harbour, where there are large flats of &s;and and mud, there is great plenty of water-fowl, mo&s;t of which were altogether unknown to us: one of the mo&s;t remarkable was black and white, much larger than a &s;wan, and in &s;hape &s;omewhat re&s;embling a pe|lican. On the&s;e banks of &s;and and mud there are great quan|tities of oy&s;ters, mu&s;cles, cockles, and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, which &s;eem to be the principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the inhabitants, who go into &s;hoal water with their little canoes, and pick them out with their hands. We did not ob&s;erve that they eat any of them raw, nor do they always go on &s;hore to dre&s;s them, for they have frequently fires in their canoes for that purpo&s;e. They do not however &s;ub&s;i&s;t wholly upon this food, for they catch a variety of other fi&s;h, &s;ome of which they &s;trike with gigs, and &s;ome they take with hook and line. All the inha|bitants that we &s;aw were &s;tark naked: they did not appear to be numerous, nor to live in &s;ocieties, but like other animals were &s;cattered about along the coa&s;t, and in the woods. Of their manner of life, however, we could know but little, as we were never able to form the lea&s;t connection with them: af|ter the fir&s;t conte&s;t at our landing, they would never come near enough to parley; nor did they touch a &s;ingle article of all
<PB N="61" REF="013324_0350_0F90F29758282C70">
that we had left them at their huts, and the places they fre|quented, on purpo&s;e for them to take away.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay in this harbour, I cau&s;ed the Engli&s;h colours to be di&s;played on &s;hore every day, and the &s;hip's name, and the date of the year, to be in&s;cribed upon one of the trees near the watering-place.</P>
<P>It is high water here at the full and change of the moon about eight o'clock, and the tide ri&s;es and falls perpendicu|larly between four and five feet.</P>

<P>AT day-break, on Sunday the 6th of May 1770, we &s;et &s;ail from Botany Bay, with a light breeze at N. W. which &s;oon after coming to the &s;outhward, we &s;teered along the &s;hore N. N. E.; and at noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 33:50 S. At this time we were between two and three miles di&s;tant from the land, and a-brea&s;t of a bay, or harbour, in which there appeared to be good anchorage, and which I called PORT JACKSON. This harbour lies three leagues to the northward of Botany Bay: the variation, by &s;everal azi|muths, appeared to be 8&deg; E. At &s;un-&s;et, the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 26 E. and &s;ome broken land that &s;eem|ed to form a bay, bore N. 40 W. di&s;tant four leagues. This bay, which lies in latitude 33:42, I called BROKEN BAY. We &s;teered along the &s;hoore N. N. E. all night, at the di&s;|tance of about three leagues from the land, having from thirty-two to thirty-&s;ix fathom water, with a hard &s;andy bottom.</P>
<P>Soon after &s;un-ri&s;e on the 7th, I took &s;everal azimuths, with four needles belonging to the azimuth compa&s;s, the mean re&s;ult of which gave the variation 7:56 E. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation, was 33:22 S.: we were about three leagues from the &s;hore; the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 19 E. and &s;ome lands which projected in three bluff points, and which, for that rea&s;on, I called CAPE THREE POINTS, bore S. W. di&s;tant five leagues. Our longitude from Botany Bay was 19 E. In the afternoon, we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places upon the &s;hore, and in the evening, found the variation to be 8:25 E. At this time we were between two and three miles from the &s;hore, in twenty-eight fathom; and at noon the next day, we had not advanced one &s;tep to the northward. We &s;tood off &s;hore, with the winds northerly, till twelve at night, and at the di&s;tance of about five leagues, had &s;eventy
<PB N="62" REF="013324_0351_0F90F29805097978">
fathom; at the di&s;tance of &s;ix leagues we had eighty fathom, which is the extent of the &s;oundings; for at the di&s;tance of ten leagues, we had no ground with 150 fathom.</P>
<P>The wind continuing northerly, till the morning of the 10th, we continued to &s;tand in and off the &s;hore, with very little change of &s;ituation in other re&s;pects; but a gale then &s;pring|ing up at S. W. we made the be&s;t of our way along the &s;hore to the northward. At &s;un-ri&s;e, our latitude was 33:2 S. and the variation 8&deg; E. At nine in the forenoon, we pa&s;&s;ed a re|markable hill, which &s;tood a little way inland, and &s;omewhat re&s;embled the crown of a hat: and at noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 32:53 S. and our longitude 208&deg; W. We were about two leagues di&s;tant from the land, which extended from N. 41 E. to S. 41 W., and a &s;mall round rock, or i&s;land, which lay clo&s;e under the land, bore S. 82 W. di&s;tant between three and four leagues. At four in the afternoon, we pa&s;&s;ed, at the di&s;tance of about a mile, a low rocky point, which I called POINT STEPHENS, on the north &s;ide of which is an inlet, which I called PORT STEPHENS: this inlet appeared to me, from the ma&s;t head, to be &s;heltered from all winds. It lies in latitude 32:40, longitude 207:51, and at the en|trance are three &s;mall i&s;lands, two of which are high; and on the main, near the &s;hore, are &s;ome high round hills, which at a di&s;tance appear like i&s;lands. In pa&s;&s;ing this bay, at the di&s;|tance of two or three miles from the &s;hore, our &s;oundings were from thirty-three, to twenty-&s;even fathom, from which I con|jectured that there mu&s;t be a &s;ufficient depth of water within it. At a little di&s;tance within land, we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places; and at half an hour pa&s;t five, the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 36 E. and Point Stephens S. W. di&s;tant four leagues. Our &s;oundings in the night, were from forty-eight to &s;ixty-two fathom, at the di&s;tance of between three and four leagues from the &s;hore, which made in two hillocks. This Point I called CAPE HAWKE: it lies in the latitude of 32:14 S., longitude 207:30 W.; and at four o'clock in the morning bore W. di&s;tant about eight miles; at the &s;ame time the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 6 E. and appeared like an i&s;land. At noon, this land bore N. 8 E. the norther|mo&s;t land in &s;ight N. 13 E. and Cape Hawke S. 37 W. Our latitude, by ob&s;ervation was 32:2 S. which was twelve miles to the &s;outhward of that given by the log; &s;o that probably we had a current &s;etting that way: by the morning ampli|tude and azimuth, the variation was 9:10 E. During our run along the &s;hore, in the afternoon, we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places, at a little di&s;tance from the beach, and one upon the top of a hill, which was the fir&s;t we had &s;een upon elevated ground, &s;ince our arrival upon the coa&s;t. At &s;un &s;et, we had twenty-three fathom, at the di&s;tance of a league and an half
<PB N="63" REF="013324_0352_0F90F29986264F70">
from the &s;hore: the northermo&s;t land then bore N. 13 E. and three hills, remarkably large and high, lying contiguous to each other, and not far from the beach, N. N. W. As the&s;e hills bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to each other, we called them the THREE BROTHERS. They lie in latitude 31:40, and may be &s;een fourteen or &s;ixteen leagues. We &s;teered N. E. by N. all night, having from twenty-&s;even to &s;ixty-&s;even fathom, at the di&s;tance of between two and &s;ix leagues from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>At day-break, we &s;teered north, for the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight. At noon we were four leagues from the &s;hore, and by ob&s;ervation, in latitude 31:18 S., which was fifteen miles to the &s;outhward of that given by the log; our longitude 206:58 W. In the afternoon we &s;tood in for the land, where we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places, till &s;ix in the evening, when, be|ing within three or four miles of it, and in twenty-four fathom of water, we &s;tood off with a fre&s;h breeze at N. and N. N. W. till midnight, when we had 118 fathom, at the di&s;tance of eight leagues from the land, and then tacked. At three in the morning, the wind veered to the we&s;tward, when we tacked and &s;tood to the northward. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 30:43 S., and our longitude 206:45 W. At this time we were between three and four leagues from the &s;hore, the northermo&s;t part of which bore from us N. 13 W. and a point, or head land, on which we &s;aw fires that produced a great quantity of &s;moke, bore W. di&s;tant four leagues. To this point I gave the name of SMOKEY CAPE: it is of a con&s;iderable height, and over the pitch of the point is a round hillock; within it are two others, much high|er and larger, and within them the land is very low. Our la|titude was 30:31 S., longitude 206:54 W.: this day the ob&s;erved latitude was only five miles &s;outh of the log. We &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal parts along the coa&s;t, be&s;ides that &s;een upon Smoky Cape.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the wind being at N. E. we &s;tood off and on, and at three or four miles di&s;tance from the &s;hore had thirty fathom water: the wind afterwards coming cro&s;s off land, we &s;tood to the northward, having from thirty to twenty-one fa|thom, at the di&s;tance of four or five miles from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>At five in the morning the wind veered to the north, and blew fre&s;h, attended with &s;qualls: at eight, it began to thun|der and rain, and in about an hour it fell calm, which gave us an opportunity to &s;ound, and we had eighty-&s;ix fathom at be|tween four and five leagues from the &s;hore: &s;oon after this we had a gale from the &s;outhward, with which we &s;teered N. by W. for the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight. At noon we were about four leagues from the &s;hore, and by ob&s;ervation, in latitude 30:22, which was nine miles to the &s;outhward of our reckon|ing,
<PB N="64" REF="013324_0353_0F90F29A50E6FB08">
longitude 206:39 W. Some lands near the &s;hore, of a con&s;iderable height, bore W.</P>
<P>As we advanced to the northward, from Botany Bay, the land gradually increa&s;ed in height, &s;o that in this latitude it may be called a hilly country. Between this latitude and the Bay, it exhibits a plea&s;ing variety of ridges, hills, vallies, and plains, all clothed with wood, of the &s;ame appearance with that which has been particularly de&s;cribed: the land near the &s;hore is in general low and &s;andy, except the points, which are rocky, and over many of them are high hills, which, at their fir&s;t ri&s;ing out of the water, have the appearance of i&s;lands. In the afternoon, we had &s;ome &s;mall rocky i&s;lands between us and the land, the &s;outhermo&s;t of which lies in la|titude 30:10, and the northermo&s;t in 29:58, and &s;omewhat more than two leagues from the land: about two miles with|out the northermo&s;t i&s;land we had thirty-three fathom water, having the advantage of a moon, we &s;teered along the &s;hore all night, in the direction of N. and N. by E. keeping at the di&s;tance of about three leagues from the land, and having from twenty to twenty-five fathom water. As &s;oon as it was light, having a fre&s;h g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">le, we made all the &s;ail we could, and at nine o'clock in the morning, being about a league from the &s;hore, we di&s;covered &s;moke in many places, and having recour&s;e to our gla&s;&s;es, we &s;aw about twenty of the natives, who had each a large bundle upon his back, which we conjectured to be palm leaves far covering their hou&s;es: we continued to ob|&s;erve them above an hour, during which they walked upon the beach, and up a path that led over a hill of a gentle a&s;cent, behind which we lo&s;t &s;ight of them: not one of them was ob|&s;erved to &s;top and look towards us, but they trudged along, to all appearance, without the lea&s;t emotion either of curio&s;ity or &s;urprize, though it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould not have &s;een the &s;hip by a ca&s;ual glance, as they walked along the &s;hore; and though they mu&s;t, with re&s;pect to every other object they had yet &s;een, have been little le&s;s &s;tupenduous, and unac|countable, than a floating mountain, with all its woods, would have been to us. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 28:39 S., and longitude 206:27 W. A high point of land, which I named CAPE BYRON, bore N. W. by W. at the di&s;tance of three miles. It lies in latitude 28:37:30 S., longitude 206:30 W. and may be known by a remarkable &s;harp peaked mountain, which lies inland, and bears from it N. W. by W. From this point, the land trends N. 13 W.: inland it is high and hilly, but low near the &s;hore; to the &s;outhward of the point it is al&s;o low and level. We conti|nued to &s;teer along the &s;hore with a fre&s;h gale, till &s;un-&s;et, when we &s;uddenly di&s;covered breakers a-head, directly in the &s;hip's cour&s;e, and al&s;o on our larboard bow. At this time we
<PB N="65" REF="013324_0354_0F90F29B037C49C8">
were about five miles from the land, and had twenty fathom water: we hauled up ea&s;t till eight, when we had run eight miles, and increa&s;ed our depth of water to forty-four fathom: we then brought to, with the &s;hip's head to the ea&s;tward, and lay upon this tack till ten, when, having increa&s;ed our &s;ound|ing to &s;eventy-eight fathom, we wore, and lay with the &s;hip's head to the land till five in the morning, when we made &s;ail, and at daylight we were greatly &s;urprized to find our&s;elves far|ther to the &s;outhward, than we had been the evening before, though the wind had been &s;outherly, and blown fre&s;h all night: we now &s;aw the breakers again within us, and pa&s;&s;ed them at the di&s;tance of one league. They lie in latitude 28:8 S. &s;tretching off ea&s;t two leagues, from a point of land, un|der which is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> i&s;land. Their &s;ituation may always be known by the peaked mountain which has been ju&s;t mentioned, and which bears from them S. W. by W. for this rea&s;on I have named it MOUNT WARNING. It lies &s;even or eight leagues inland, in latitude 28:22 S. The land about it is high and hilly, but it is of it&s;elf &s;ufficiently con&s;picuous to be at once di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other object. The point off which the&s;e &s;hoals lie, I have named POINT DANGER. To the northward of this point the land is low, and trends N. W. by N.; but it &s;oon turns again more to the northward.</P>
<P>At noon we were about two leagues from the land, and by ob&s;ervation, in latitude 27:46 S. which was &s;eventeen miles to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of the log; our longitude was 206:26 W. Mount Warning bore S. 26 W. di&s;tant 14 leagues, and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. We pur&s;ued our cour&s;e along the &s;hore, at the di&s;tance of about two leagues, in the direction of N. &frac34; E. till between four and five in the after|noon, when we di&s;covered breakers on our larboard bow. Our depth of water was thirty-&s;even fathom, and at &s;un-&s;et, the northermo&s;t land bore N. by W. the breakers N. W. by W. di&s;tant four miles, and the northermo&s;t land &s;et at noon, which formed a point, and to which I gave the name of POINT LOOK-OUT, W. di&s;tant five or &s;ix miles, in the latitude of 27 6. On the north &s;ide of this point, the &s;hore forms a wide open bay, which I called MORETON's BAY, in the bottom of which the land is &s;o low that I could but ju&s;t &s;ee it from the top-ma&s;t head. The breakers lie between three and four miles from Point Look-out; and at this time we had a great &s;ea from the &s;outh, which broke upon them very high. We &s;tood on N. N. E. till eight o'clock, when having pa&s;&s;ed the breakers, and deepened our water to fifty-two fathom, we brought to till midnight, when we made &s;ail again to the N. N. E. At four in the morning, we had 135 fathom, and when the day broke, I perceived that during the night I had got much farther northward, and from the &s;hore than I ex|pected
<PB N="66" REF="013324_0355_0F90F29BB7BE2C10">
from the cour&s;e we &s;teered, for we were di&s;tant at lea&s;t &s;even leagues; I therefore hauled in N. W. by W. with a fre&s;h gale at S. S. W. The land that was farthe&s;t to the north the night before, now bore S. S. W. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues, and I gave it the name of CAPE MORETON, it being the north point of Moreton's Bay: its latitude is 26:56, and its longitude is 206:28. From Cape Moreton the land trends away we&s;t, farther than can be &s;een, for there is a &s;mall &s;pace, where at this time no land is vi&s;ible, and &s;ome on board having al&s;o ob|&s;erved that the &s;ea looked paler than u&s;ual, we were of opinion that the bottom of Moreton's Bay opened into a river: we had here thirty-four fathom water, and a fine &s;andy bottom: this alone would have produced the change that had been ob&s;erved in the colour of the water; and it was by no means nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e a river to account for the land at the bottom of the bay not being vi&s;ible, for &s;uppo&s;ing the land there to be as low as we knew it to be in an hundred other parts of the coa&s;t, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee it from the &s;tation of the &s;hip; how|ever, if any future navigator &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to determine the que&s;tion, whether there is or is not a river in this place, which the wind would not permit us to do, the &s;ituation may always be found by three hills, which lie to the northward of it, in the latitude of 26:53. The&s;e hills lie but a little way inland, and not far from each other: they are remarkable for the &s;ingular form of their elevation, which very much re|&s;embles a gla&s;s-hou&s;e, and for which rea&s;on I called them the GLASS HOUSES: the northermo&s;t of the three is the highe&s;t and large&s;t: there are al&s;o &s;everal other peaked hills, inland to the northward of the&s;e, but they are not nearly &s;o remarkable. At noon, our latitude was, by ob&s;ervation, 26:28 S. which was ten miles to the northward of the log, a circum&s;tance which had never before happened upon this coa&s;t; our longi|tude was 206:46. At this time we were between two and three leagues from the land, and had twenty-four fathom wa|ter. A low bluff poiut, which was the &s;outh head of a &s;andy bay, bore N. 62 W. di&s;tant three leagues, and the northermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight bore N. &frac14; E. This day we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places, and &s;ome at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance inland.</P>
<P>In &s;teering along the &s;hore, at the di&s;tance of two leagues, our &s;oundings were from twenty-four to thirty-two fathom, with a &s;andy bottom. At &s;ix in the evening, the northermo&s;t point of land bore N. &frac14; W. di&s;tant four leagues; at ten it bore N. W. by W. &frac12; W. and as we had &s;een no land to the northward of it, we brought to, not well knowing which way to &s;teer.</P>
<P>At two in the morning, however, we made &s;ail with the wind at S. W. and at day-light, we &s;aw the land extending as far as N. &frac34; E. the point we had &s;et the night before bore S. W.
<PB N="67" REF="013324_0356_0F90F29C786F6B10">
by W. di&s;tant between three and four leagues. It lies in la|titude 25:58, longitude 206:48 W.: the land within it is of a moderate and equal height, but the point it&s;elf is &s;o unequal that it looks like two &s;mall i&s;lands lying under the land, for which rea&s;on I gave it the name of DOUBLE ISLAND POINT; it may al&s;o be known by the white cliffs on the north &s;ide of it. Here the land trends to the N. W. and forms a large open bay, the bottom of which is &s;o low a flat that from the deck it could &s;carcely be &s;een. In cro&s;&s;ing this bay, our depth of water was from thirty to twenty-two fathom, with a white &s;andy bottom. At noon we were about three leagues from the &s;hore, in lati|tude 25:34 S. longitude 206:45 W.: Double I&s;land Point bore S. &frac34; W. and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight N. &frac34; E. This part of the coa&s;t, which is of a moderate height, is more bar|ren than any we had &s;een, and the &s;oil more &s;andy. With our gla&s;|&s;es we could di&s;cover that the &s;ands, which lay in great patches of many acres, were moveable, and that &s;ome of them had not been long in the place they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for we &s;aw in &s;everal parts, the trees half buried, the tops of which were &s;till green; and in others, the naked trunks of &s;uch as the &s;and had &s;ur|rounded long enough to de&s;troy. In other places the woods appeared to be low and &s;hrubby, and we &s;aw no &s;igns of in|habitants. Two water &s;nakes &s;wam by the &s;hip: they were beautifully &s;potted, and in every re&s;pect like land &s;nakes, ex|cept that their tails were broad and flat, probably to &s;erve them in&s;tead of fins in &s;wimming. In the morning of this day, the variation was 8:20 E. and in the evening, 8:36. During the night, we continued our cour&s;e to the northward, with a light breeze from the land, being di&s;tant from it be|tween two and three leagues, and having from twenty-three to twenty-&s;even fathom, with a fine &s;andy bottom.</P>
<P>At noon, on the 19th, we were about four miles from the land, with only thirteen fathom. Our latitude was 25:4, and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. 21 W. di&s;tant eight miles. At one o'clock, being &s;till four miles di&s;tant from the &s;hore, but having &s;eventeen fathom water, we pa&s;&s;ed a black bluff head, or point of land, upon which a great number of the natives were a&s;&s;embled, and which therefore I called INDIAN HEAD: it lies in latitude 25:3. About four miles N. by W. of this Head, is another very like it, from whence the land trends away &s;omewhat more to the we&s;tward: next to the &s;ea it is low and &s;andy, and behind it nothing was to be &s;een, even from the ma&s;t-head. Near Indian Head we &s;aw more of the natives, and upon the neighbouring &s;hore fires by night, and &s;moke by day. We kept to the northward all night, at the di&s;tance of from four miles to four leagues from the &s;hore, and with a depth of water from &s;eventeen to thirty-four fa|thom. At day-break, the northermo&s;t land bore from us W.
<PB N="68" REF="013324_0357_0F90F29E00E14010">
S. W. and &s;eemed to end in a point, from which we di&s;co|vered a reef running out to the northward as far as we could &s;ee. We had hauled our wind to the we&s;tward before it was light, and continued the cour&s;e till we &s;aw the breakers upon our lee bow. We now edged away N. W. and N. N. W. along the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;hoal, from two to one mile di&s;tant, having regular &s;oundings from thirteen to &s;even fathom, with a fine &s;andy bottom. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 20:26, which was thirteen miles to the northward of the log: we judged the extream point of the &s;hoal to bear from us about N. W. and the point from which it &s;eemed to run out, bore S. &frac34; W. di&s;tant twenty miles. This point I named SANDY CAPE, from two very large patches of white &s;and which lay upon it. It is &s;ufficiently high to be &s;een at the di&s;|tance of twelve leagues, in clear weather, and lies in latitude 24:45, longitude 206:51: the land trends from it S. W. as far as it can be &s;een. We kept along the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;hoal till two in the afternoon, when, judging that there was a &s;ufficient depth of water upon it, to allow pa&s;&s;age for the &s;hip, I &s;ent the boat a-head to &s;ound, and upon her making the &s;ignal for more than five fathom, we hauled our wind, and &s;tood over the tail of it in &s;ix fathom. At this time we were in latitude 24:22, and Sandy Cape bore S. &frac12; E. di&s;|tant eight leagues; but the direction on the &s;hoal is neare&s;t N. N. W. and S. S. E. It it remarkable that when on board the &s;hip we had &s;ix fathom, the boat, which was &s;carcely a quarter of a mile to the &s;outhward, had little more than five, and that immediately after &s;ix fathom we had thirteen, and then twenty, as fa&s;t as the man could ca&s;t the lead: from the&s;e circum&s;tances, I conjectured that the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;hoal was &s;teep. This &s;hoal I called the BREAK SEA SPIT, becau&s;e we had now &s;mooth water, and to the &s;outhward of it we had always a high &s;ea from the S. E. At &s;ix in the evening, the land of Sandy Cape extended from S. 17 E. to S. 27 E. at he di&s;tance of eight leagues; our depth of water was twenty-three fathom: with the &s;ame &s;oundings we &s;tood to the we&s;tward all night. At &s;even in the morning, we &s;aw, from the ma&s;t head, the land of Sandy Cape bearing S. E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant about thirteen leagues: at nine we di&s;covered land to the we&s;tward, and &s;oon after &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places. Our depth of water was now decrea&s;ed to &s;eventeen fathom, and by noon we had no more than thirteen, though we were &s;even leagues from the land, which extended from S. by W. to W. N. W. Our latitude at this time was 24:28 S. For a few days pa&s;t we had &s;een &s;everal of the &s;ea birds called boo|bies, not having met with any of them before; la&s;t night a &s;mall flock of them pa&s;&s;ed the &s;hip, and went away to the N.

&s;un-ri&s;e, to half an hour after, flights of them were continu|ally coming from the N. N. W. and flying to the S. S. E. nor was one of them &s;een to fly in any other direction; we there|fore conjectured that there was a lagoon, river, or inlet of &s;hal|low water, in the bottom of the deep bay, to the &s;outhward of us, whither the&s;e birds re&s;orted to feed in the day, and that not far to the northward there were &s;ome i&s;lands to which they repaired in the night. To this bay I gave the name of HER|VEY's BAY, in honour of Captain Hervey. In the afternoon, we &s;tood in for the land, &s;teering S. W. with a gentle breeze at S. E. till four o'clock, when, being in latitude 24:36, about two leagues from the &s;hore, and having nine fathom water, we bore away along the coa&s;t N. W. by W. and at the &s;ame time could &s;ee land extending to the S. S. E. about eight leagues. Near the &s;ea the land is very low, but within there are &s;ome lofty hills, all thickly clothed with wood. While we were running along the &s;hore, we &s;hallowed our water from nine to &s;even fathom, and at one time we had but &s;ix, which determined us to anchor for the night.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning we weighed, with a gentle breeze from the &s;outhward, and &s;teered N. W. &frac14; W. edging in for the land till we got within two miles of it, with water from &s;even to eleven fathom: we then &s;teered N. N. W. as the land lay, and at noon, our latitude was 24:19. We continued in the &s;ame cour&s;e, at the &s;ame di&s;tance, with from twelve fathom to &s;even, till five in the evening, when we were abrea&s;t of the &s;outh point of a large open bay, in which I intended to anchor. During this cour&s;e, we di&s;covered with our gla&s;&s;es that the land was covered with palm-nut-trees, which we had not &s;een from the time of our leaving the i&s;lands within the Tropick: we al&s;o &s;aw two men walking along the &s;hore, who did not conde&s;cend to take the lea&s;t notice of us. In the even|ing, having hauled clo&s;e upon a wind, and made two or three trips, we anchored about eight o'clock in five fathom, with a fine &s;andy bottom. The &s;outh point of the bay bore E. &frac34; S. di&s;tant two miles, the north point N. W. &frac14; N. and about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Early the next morning I went a&s;hore, with a party of men, in order to examine the country, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, the other gentlemen, and Tupia: the wind blew fre&s;h, and we found it &s;o cold, that being at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore, we took our cloaks as a nece&s;&s;ary equipment for the voyage. We landed a little within the &s;outh point of the bay, where we found a channel leading into a large la|goon: this channel I proceeded to examine, and found three fathom water till I got about a mile up it, where I met with a &s;hoal, upon which there was little more than one fathom, but having pa&s;&s;ed over it, I had three fathom again. The
<PB N="70" REF="013324_0359_0F90F29F75617760">
entrance of this channel lies clo&s;e to the &s;outh point of the bay, being formed by the &s;hore on the ea&s;t, and on the we&s;t by a large &s;pit of &s;and: it is about a quarter of a mile broad, and lies in S. by W. In this place there is room for a few &s;hips to lie in great &s;ecurity, and a &s;mall &s;tream of fre&s;h water; I would have rowed into the lagoon, but was prevented by &s;hallows. We found &s;everal bogs, and &s;wamps of &s;alt water, upon which, and by the &s;ides of the lagoon, grows the true mangrove, &s;uch as is found in the We&s;t-Indies, and the fir&s;t of the kind that we had met with. In the branches of the&s;e mangroves there were many ne&s;ts of a remarkable kind of ant, that was as green as gra&s;s: when the branches were di&s;turbed they came out in great numbers, and puni&s;hed the offender by a much &s;harper bite than ever we had felt from the &s;ame kind of animal before. Upon the&s;e mangroves al&s;o we &s;aw &s;mall green caterpillars in great numbers: their bodies were thick &s;et with hairs, and they were ranged upon the leaves &s;ide by &s;ide, like a file of &s;oldiers, to the number of twenty or thirty together: when we touched them, we found that the hair on their bodies had the quality of a nettle, and gave us a much more acute, though le&s;s durable pain. The country here is manife&s;tly wor&s;e than about Botany Bay: the &s;oil is dry and &s;andy, but the &s;ides of the hills are covered with trees, which grow &s;eparately, without underwood. We found here the tree that yields a gum like the <HI>Sanguis draconis;</HI> but it is &s;ome|what different from the trees of the &s;ame kind which we had &s;een before, for the leaves are longer, and hang down like tho&s;e of the weeping willow. We found al&s;o much le&s;s gum upon them, which is contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion, that the hotter the climate, the more gums exude. Upon a plant al&s;o, which yielded a yellow gum, there was le&s;s than upon the &s;ame kind of plant in Botany Bay, among the &s;hoals and &s;and banks we &s;aw many large birds, &s;ome in particular of the &s;ame kind, that we had &s;een in Botany Bay, much bigger than &s;wans, which we judged to be pelicans; but they were &s;o &s;hy that we could not get within gun-&s;hot of them. Upon the &s;hore we &s;aw a &s;pecies of the bu&s;tard, one of which we &s;hot, it was as large as a turkey, and weighed &s;eventeen pounds and an half. We all agreed that this was the be&s;t bird we had eaten &s;ince we left England; and in honour of it we called this inlet BUSTARD BAY. It lies in latitude 24:4, longitude 208:18. The &s;ea &s;eemed to abound with fi&s;h; but, unhappily, we tore our &s;eine all to pieces at the fir&s;t haul: upon the mud banks, under the mangroves, we found innumerable oy&s;ters of various kinds; among others the hammer oy&s;ter, and a large proportion of &s;mall pearl-oy&s;ters: if in deeper water there is equal plenty of &s;uch oy&s;ters at their full growth, a pearl fi&s;he|ry might certainly be e&s;tabli&s;hed here to a very great advantage.</P>

The people who were left on board the &s;hip &s;aid, that while we were in the woods about twenty of the natives came down to the beach, abrea&s;t of her, and having looked at her &s;ome|time, went away; but we, that were a&s;hore, though we &s;aw &s;moke in many places, &s;aw no people: the &s;moke was at places too di&s;tant for us to get to them by land, except one, to which we repaired: we found ten &s;mall fires &s;till burning within a few paces of each other; but the people were gone: we &s;aw near them &s;everal ve&s;&s;els of bark, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to have contained water, and &s;ome &s;hells and fi&s;h-bones, the remains of a recent meal. We &s;aw al&s;o, lying upon the ground, &s;everal pieces of &s;oft bark, about the length and breadth of a man, which we imagined might be their beds; and, on the windward &s;ide of the fires, a &s;mall &s;hade, about a foot and an half high, of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance. The whole was in a thicket of clo&s;e trees, which afforded good &s;helter from the wind. The place &s;eemed to be much trodden, and as we &s;aw no hou&s;e, nor any remains of a hou&s;e, we were inclined to believe that as the&s;e people had no clothes, they had no dwelling; but &s;pent their nights among the other commoners of Nature, in the open air: and Tupia him&s;elf, with an air of &s;uperiority and compa&s;&s;ion, &s;hook his head, and &s;aid that they were <HI>Taata Enos,</HI> 'poor wretches.' I mea&s;ured the perpendicular height of the la&s;t tide, and found it to be 8 feet above low-water mark, and from the time of low water this day, I found that it mu&s;t be high water at the full and change of the moon at eight o'clock,</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the morning we weighed, and with a gentle breeze at &s;outh made &s;ail out of the bay. In &s;tanding out, our &s;oundings were from five to fifteen fathom; and at day-light, when we were in the greate&s;t depth, and abrea&s;t of the north head of the bay, we di&s;covered breakers &s;tretching out from it N. N. E. between two and three miles, with a rock at the outermo&s;t point of them, ju&s;t above water. While we were pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e rocks, at the di&s;tance of about half a mile, we had from fifteen to twenty fathom, and as &s;oon as we had pa&s;&s;ed them, we hauled along &s;hore W. N. W. for the farthe&s;t land we had in &s;ight. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 23:52 S.; the north part of Bu&s;tard Bay bore S. 62 E. di&s;tant ten miles; and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight N. 60 W.; the longitude was 208:37, and our di&s;tance from the neare&s;t &s;hore &s;ix miles, with fourteen fathom water.</P>
<P>Till five in the afternoon it was calm, but afterwards we &s;teered before the wind N. W. as the land lay, till ten at night, and then brought to, having had all along 14 and 15 fathom. At five in the morning we made &s;ail: and at day-light the northermo&s;t point of the main bore N. 70 W. Soon af|ter we &s;aw more land, making like i&s;lands, and bearing N. W.
<PB N="72" REF="013324_0361_0F90F2A10A2ECBD8">
by N. At nine, we were abrea&s;t of a point, at the di&s;tance of one mile, with fourteen fathom water. This point I found to lie directly under the Tropic of Capricorn; and for that rea|&s;on I called it CAPE CAPRICORN: its longitude is 208:58 W.; it is of a con&s;iderable height, looks white and barren, and may be known by &s;ome i&s;lands which lie to the N. W. of it, and &s;ome &s;mall rocks at the di&s;tance of about a league S. E. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the Cape there appeared to be a la|goon, and on the two &s;pits which formed the entrance we &s;aw an incredible number of the large birds that re&s;emble a peli|can. The northermo&s;t land now in &s;ight bore from Cape Capricorn N. 24 W. and appeared to be an i&s;land; but the main land trended W. by N. &frac12; N. which cour&s;e we &s;teered, having from fifteen to &s;ix fathom, and from &s;ix to nine, with a hard &s;andy bottom. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 23:24 S.; Cape Capricorn bore S. 60 E. di&s;tant two leagues; and a &s;mall i&s;land N. by E. two miles: in this &s;itu|ation we had nine fathom, being about four miles from the main, which, next the &s;ea, is low and &s;andy, except the points which are high and rocky. The country inland is hilly, but by no means of a plea&s;ing a&s;pect. We continued to &s;tand to the N. W. till four o'clock in the afternoon, when it fell calm; and we &s;oon after anchored in twelve fathom, having the main land and i&s;lands in a manner all round us, and Cape Capricorn bearing S. 54 E. di&s;tant four leagues. In the night, we found the tide ri&s;e and fall near &s;even feet; and the flood to &s;et to the we&s;tward, and the ebb to the ea&s;tward, which is ju&s;t contrary to whhat we found when we were at anchor to the ea&s;tward of Bu&s;tard Bay.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning we weighed, with a gentle breeze at South, and &s;tood away to the N. W. between the outermo&s;t range of i&s;lands and the main, leaving &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands between the main and the &s;hip, which we pa&s;&s;ed at a very little di&s;tance: our &s;oundings being irregular, from twelve to four fathom, I &s;ent a boat a-head to &s;ound. At noon we were about three miles from the main, and about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the i&s;lands without us: our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 23:7 S.: the main land here is high and mountainous; the i&s;lands which lie off it are al&s;o mo&s;t of them high, and of a &s;mall circuit, having an appearance rather of barrenne&s;s than ferti|lity. At this time we &s;aw &s;moke in many places, at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance inland, and therefore conjectured that there might be a lagoon, river, or inlet running up the country, the rather as we had pa&s;&s;ed two places which had the appear|ance of being &s;uch; but our depth of water was too little to encourage me to venture where I &s;hould probably have le&s;s. We had not &s;tood to the northward above an hour, before we &s;ud|denly fell into three fathom; upon which I anchored, and
<PB N="73" REF="013324_0362_0F90F2A1B6A14A60">
&s;ent away the Ma&s;ter to &s;ound the channel which lay to leeward of us, between the northermo&s;t i&s;land and the main: it ap|peared to be pretty broad, but I &s;u&s;pected that it was &s;hallow, and &s;o indeed it was found; for the ma&s;ter reported at his re|turn that in many places he had only two fathom and an half, and where we lay at anchor we had only &s;ixteen feet, which was not two feet more than the &s;hip drew. While the ma&s;ter was &s;ounding the channel, Mr. Banks tried to fi&s;h from the cabin windows, with hook and line: the water was too &s;hal|low for fi&s;h; but the ground was almo&s;t covered with crabs, which readily took the bait, and &s;ometimes held it &s;o fa&s;t in their claws, that they did not quit their hold till they were con&s;iderably above water. The&s;e crabs were of two &s;orts, and both of them &s;uch as we had not &s;een before: one of them was adorned with the fine&s;t blue that can be imagined, in every re&s;pect equal to the ultramarine, with which all his claws, and every joint was deeply tinged: the under part of him was white, and &s;o exqui&s;itely poli&s;hed that in colour and brightne&s;s it exactly re&s;embled the white of old china: the other was al&s;o marked with the ultramarine upon his joints, and his toes, but &s;omewhat more &s;paringly; and his back was marked with three brown &s;pots, which had a &s;ingular ap|pearance. The people who had been out with the boat to found, reported, that upon an i&s;land where we had ob&s;erved two fires, they had &s;een &s;everal of the inhabitants, who called to them, and &s;eemed very de&s;irous that they &s;hould land. In the evening, the wind veered to E. N. E. which gave us an opportunity to &s;tretch three or four miles back by the way we came; after which, the wind &s;hifted to the &s;outh, and obliged us again to anchor in &s;ix fathom.</P>
<P>At five in the morning, I &s;ent away the ma&s;ter to &s;earch for a pa&s;&s;age between the i&s;lands, while we got the &s;hip un|der &s;ail; and as &s;oon as it was light we followed the boat, which made a &s;ignal that a pa&s;&s;age had been found. As &s;oon as we got again into deep water, we made &s;ail to the north|ward, as the land lay, with &s;oundings from nine fathom to fifteen, and &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands &s;till without us. At noon we were about two leagues di&s;tant from the main; and by ob&s;er|vation in latitude 22:53 S. The northermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight now bore N. N. W. di&s;tant ten miles. To this point I gave the name of CAPE MANIFOLD, from the number of high hills which appeared over it: it lies in latitude 22:43 S. and di&s;tant about &s;eventeen leagues from Cape Capricorn, in the direction of N. 26 W. Between the&s;e Capes the &s;hore forms a large bay, which I called KEPPEL BAY; and I al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed the i&s;lands by the name of KEPPEL's ISLAND<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. In this bay there is a good anchorage; but what refre&s;hments it may afford, I know not: we caught no fi&s;h, though we
<PB N="74" REF="013324_0363_0F90F2A272585228">
were at anchor; but probably there is fre&s;h water in &s;everal places, as both the i&s;lands and the main are inhabited. We &s;aw &s;moke and fires upon the main; and upon the i&s;lands we &s;aw people. At three in the afternoon, we pa&s;&s;ed Cape Ma|nifold, from which the land trends N. N. W. The land of the Cape is high, ri&s;ing in hills directly from the &s;ea; and may be known by three i&s;lands which lie off it, one of them near the &s;hore, and the other two eight miles out at &s;ea. One of the&s;e i&s;lands is low and flat, and the other high and round. At &s;ix o'clock in the evening we brought to, when the nor|thermo&s;t part of the main in &s;ight bore N. W. and &s;ome i&s;lands which lie off it N. 31 W. Our &s;oundings after twelve o'clock were from twenty to twenty-five fathom, and in the night from thirty to thirty-four.</P>
<P>At day-break we made &s;ail, Cape Manifold bearing S. by E. di&s;tant eight leagues, and the i&s;lands which I had &s;et the night before were di&s;tant four miles in the &s;ame direction. The far|the&s;t vi&s;ible point of the main bore N. 67 W. at the di&s;tance of twenty-two miles; but we could &s;ee &s;everal i&s;lands to the northward of this direction. At nine o'clock in the forenoon, we were abrea&s;t of the point which I called CAPE TOWN|SEND. It lies in latitude 22:15; longitude 209:43: the land is high and level, and rather naked than woody. Seve|ral i&s;lands lie to the northward of it, at the di&s;tance of four or five miles out at &s;ea; three or four leagues to the S. E. the &s;hore forms a bay, in the bottom of which there appeared to be an inlet or harbour. To the we&s;tward of the Cape the land trends S. W. &frac12; S. and there forms a very large bay, which turns to the ea&s;tward, and probably communicates with the in|let, and makes the land of the cape an i&s;land. As &s;oon as we got round this cape, we hauled our wind to the we&s;tward, in order to get within the i&s;lands, which lie &s;cattered in the bay in great numbers, and extend out to &s;ea as far as the eye could reach, even from the ma&s;t head: the&s;e i&s;lands vary both in height and circuit from each other; &s;o that, although they are very numerous, no two of them are alike. We had not flood long upon a wind before we came into &s;hoal water, and were obliged to tack at once to avoid it. Having &s;ent a boat ahead, I bore away W. by N. many &s;mall i&s;lands, rocks and &s;hoals, lying between us and the main, and many of a larger extent without us: our &s;oundings till near noon were from fourteen to &s;eventeen fathom, when the boat made the &s;ignal for meet|ing with &s;hoal water: upon this we hauled clo&s;e upon a wind to the ea&s;tward, but &s;uddenly fell into three fathom and a quarter; we immediately dropped an anchor, which brought the &s;hip up with all her &s;ails &s;tanding. When the &s;hip was bought up we had four fathom, with a coar&s;e &s;andy bottom, and found a &s;trong tide &s;etting to the N. W. by W. &frac12; W. at
<PB N="75" REF="013324_0364_0F90F2A34D65E2C8">
the rate of near three miles an hour, by which we were &s;o &s;ud|denly carried upon the &s;hoal. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 22:8 S.; Cape Town&s;hend bore E. 16 S. di&s;tant thirteen miles; and the we&s;termo&s;t part of the main in &s;ight W. &frac34; N. At this time a great number of i&s;lands lay all round us.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, having &s;ounded round the &s;hip, and found that there was water &s;ufficient to carry her over the &s;hoal, we weighed, and about three o'clock made &s;ail and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, as the land lay, having &s;ent a boat ahead to &s;ound. At &s;ix in the evening, we anchored in ten fathom, with a &s;an|dy bottom, at about two miles di&s;tance from the main; the we&s;termo&s;t part of which bore W. N. W. and a great number of i&s;lands, lying a long way without us, were &s;till in &s;ight.</P>
<P>At five o'clock the next morning, I &s;ent away the ma&s;ter with two boats to &s;ound the entrance of an inlet, which bore from us we&s;t, at about the di&s;tance of a league, into which I intended to go with the &s;hip, that I might wait a few days till the moon &s;hould encrea&s;e, and in the mean time examine the country. As &s;oon as the &s;hip could be got under &s;ail, the boats made the &s;ignal for anchorage; upon which we &s;tood in, and anchored in five fathom water, about a league within the en|trance of the inlet; which, as I ob&s;erved a tide to flow and ebb con&s;iderably, I judged to be a river that ran up the country to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. In this place I had thoughts of laying the &s;hip a&s;hore, and cleaning her bottom; I therefore landed with the ma&s;ter in &s;earch of a convenient place for that pur|po&s;e, and was accompanied by Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander. We found walking here exceedingly trouble&s;ome, for the ground was covered with a kind of gra&s;s, the &s;eeds of which were very &s;harp, and bearded backwards; &s;o that whenever they &s;tuck into our clothes, which indeed was at every &s;tep, they worked forwards by means of the beard, till they got at the fle&s;h; and at the &s;ame time we were &s;urrounded by a cloud of mu&s;quitos, which ince&s;&s;antly tormented us with their &s;tings. We &s;oon met with &s;everal places where the &s;hip might conveniently be laid a&s;hore; but to our great di&s;appointment we could find no fre&s;h water. We proceeded however up the country, where we found gum trees like tho&s;e that we had &s;een before, and ob|&s;erved that here al&s;o the gum was in very &s;mall quantities. Upon the branches of the&s;e trees, and &s;ome others, we found ants ne&s;ts, made of clay, as big as a bu&s;hel, &s;omething like tho&s;e de&s;cribed in Sir Hans Sloan's Natural Hi&s;tory of Jamaica, vol. 2. p. 221, tab. 258, but not &s;o &s;mooth: the ants which in|habited the&s;e ne&s;ts were &s;mall, and their bodies white. But upon another &s;pecies of the tree we found a &s;mall black ant, which perforated all the twigs, and having worked out the pit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> occupied the pipe which had contained it; yet the parts in which the&s;e in&s;ects had thus formed a lodgment, and in
<PB N="76" REF="013324_0365_0F90EC9F7476E498">
which they &s;warmed in &s;uch amazing numbers, bore leaves and flowers, and appeared to be in as flouri&s;hing a &s;tate as tho&s;e that were &s;ound. We found al&s;o an incredible number of but|terflies, &s;o that for the &s;pace of three or four acres the air was &s;o crowded with them that millions were to be &s;een in every di|rection, at the &s;ame time that every branch and twig was co|vered with others that were not upon the wing. We found here al&s;o a &s;mall fi&s;h of a &s;ingular kind; it was about the &s;ize of a minnow, and had two very &s;trong brea&s;t fins: we found it in places that were quite dry, where we &s;uppo&s;ed it might have been left by the tide; but it did not &s;eem to have become lan|guid by the want of water; for upon our approach it leaped away, by the help of the brea&s;t &s;ins, as nimbly as a frog, nei|ther indeed did it &s;eem to prefer water to land; for when we found it in the water, it frequently leaped out, and pur&s;ued its way upon dry ground: we al&s;o ob&s;erved that when it was in places where &s;mall &s;tones were &s;tanding above the &s;urface of the water, at a little di&s;tance from each other, it cho&s;e rather to leap from &s;tone to &s;tone, than to pa&s;s through the water; and we &s;aw &s;everal of them pa&s;s entirely over puddles in this manner, till they came to dry ground, and then leap away.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we renewed our &s;earch after fre&s;h water, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and therefore I determined to make my &s;tay here but &s;hort: however, having ob&s;erved from an emi|nence that the inlet penetrated a con&s;iderable way into the country, I determined to trace it in the morning.</P>
<P>At &s;un-ri&s;e I went a&s;hore, and climbing a con&s;iderable hill, I took a view of the coa&s;t and the i&s;lands that lie off it, with their bearings, having an azimuth compa&s;s with me for that pur|po&s;e; but I ob&s;erved that the needle differed very con&s;iderably in its po&s;ition, even to thirty degrees, in &s;ome places more, in others le&s;s; and once I found it differ from it&s;elf no le&s;s than two points, in the di&s;tance of fourteen feet. I took up &s;ome of the loo&s;e &s;tones that lay upon the ground, and applied them to the needle, but they produced no effect; and I therefore con|cluded that there was iron ore in the hills, of which I had re|marked other indications both here, and in the neighbouring parts. After I had made my ob&s;ervations upon the hill, I pro|ceeded with Dr. Solander up the inlet; I &s;et out with the fir&s;t of the flood, and long before high-water I had advanced above eight leagues. Its breadth thus far was from two to five miles, upon a S. W. by S. direction; but here it opened every way, and formed a large lake, which to the N. W. communicated with the &s;ea; and I not only &s;aw the &s;ea in this direction, but found the tide of flood coming &s;trongly in from that point: I al&s;o ob&s;erved an arm of this lake extending to the ea&s;tward, and it is not improbable that it may communicate with the &s;ea in the bottom of the bay, which lies to the we&s;tward of
<PB N="77" REF="013324_0366_0F8FFB93D7F50A98">
Cape Town&s;hend. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the lake is a ridge of high hills which I was very de&s;irous to climb; but it being high water, and the day far &s;pent, I was afraid of being be|wildered among the &s;hoals in the night, e&s;pecially as the wea|ther was dark and rainy; and therefore I made the be&s;t of my way to the &s;hip. In this excur&s;ion I &s;aw only two people, and they were at a di&s;tance; they followed the boat along the &s;hore a good way, but the tide running &s;trongly in my favour, I could not prudently wait for them: I &s;aw however &s;everal fires in one direction, and &s;moke in another, but they al&s;o were at a di&s;tance. While I was tracing the inlet with Dr. Solander, Mr. Banks was endeavouring to penetrate into the country, where &s;everal of the people, who had leave to go a&s;hore, were al&s;o rambling about. Mr. Banks and his party found their cour&s;e ob&s;tructed by a &s;wamp, covered with man|groves, which however they re&s;olved to pa&s;s; the mud was almo&s;t knee deep, yet they re&s;olutely went on; but before they got half way, they repented of their undertaking; the bottom was covered with branches of trees, interwoven with each other, &s;ometimes they kept their footing upon them, &s;ometimes their feet &s;lipt through, and &s;ometimes they were &s;o entangled among them, that they were forced to free them|&s;elves by groping in the mud and &s;lime with their hands. In about an hour however they cro&s;&s;ed it, and judged it might be about a quarter of a mile over. After a &s;hort walk they came up to a place where there had been four &s;mall fires, and near them &s;ome &s;hells and bones of fi&s;h, that had been roa&s;ted: they found al&s;o heaps of gra&s;s laid together, where four or five people appeared to have &s;lept. The Second Lieutenant, Mr. Gore, who was at another place, &s;aw a little water lying in the bottom of a gully, and near it the track of a large animal: &s;ome bu&s;tards were al&s;o &s;een, but none of them &s;hot, nor any other bird except a few of the beautiful loriquets, which we had &s;een in Botany Bay. Mr. Gore, and one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mid&s;hip|men, who were in different places, &s;aid that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heard the voices of Indians near them, but had &s;een none: the coun|try in general appeared &s;andy and barren, and being de&s;titute of fre&s;h water, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any &s;ettled in|habitants. The deep gullies, which were worn by torrents from the hills, prove, that at certain &s;ea&s;ons the rains here are very copious and heavy.</P>
<P>The inlet in which the &s;hip lay I called THIRSTY SOUND, becau&s;e it afforded us no fre&s;h water. It lies in latitude 22:10 S. and longitude 210:18 W.; and may be known by a group of &s;mall i&s;lands lying under the &s;hore, from two to five leagues di&s;tant, in the direction of N. W. and by another group of i&s;lands tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ie right before it, between three and four leagues out at &s;ea. Over each of the points that form the en|trance

is a high round hill, which on the N. W. is a penin&s;ula that at high water is &s;urrounded by the &s;ea: they are bold to both the &s;hores, and the di&s;tance between them is about two miles. In this inlet is good anchorage in &s;even, &s;ix, five, and four fathom; and places very convenient for laying a &s;hip down, where, at &s;pring-tides, the water does not ri&s;e le&s;s than &s;ixteen or eighteen feet. The tide flows at the full and change of the moon about eleven o'clock. I have already ob&s;erved that here is no fre&s;h water, nor could we procure refre&s;hment or any other kind: we &s;aw two turtles, but we were not able to take either of them: neither did we catch either fi&s;h or wild fowl, except a few &s;mall land-birds: we &s;aw indeed the &s;ame &s;orts of water-fowl as in Botany Bay, but they were &s;o &s;hy that we could not get a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ot at them.</P>
<P>As I had not therefore a &s;ingle inducement to &s;tay longer in this p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, I weighed anchor at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, of Thur&s;day the 31&s;t of May, and put to &s;ea. We &s;tood to the N. W. with a fre&s;h breeze at S. S. E. and kept without the group of i&s;lands that lie in &s;hore, and to the N. W. of Thir&s;ty Sound, as there appeared to be no &s;afe pa&s;&s;age be|tween them and the main: at the &s;ame time we had a number of i&s;lands without us, extending as far as we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould &s;ee: during our run in this direction our depth of water was ten, eight, and nine fathom. At noon, the we&s;t point of Thir&s;ty Sound, which I have called PIER HEAD, bore S. 36 E. di&s;tant five leagues; the ea&s;t point of the other inlet, which communi|cates with the &s;ound, bore S. by W. di&s;tant two leagues: the group of i&s;lands ju&s;t mentioned lay between us and the point, and the farthe&s;t part of the main in &s;ight, on the other &s;ide of the inlet, bore N. W. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 21:53. At half an hour after twelve, the boat, which was &s;ound|ing ahead, made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water, and we immedi|ately hauled our wind to the N. E. At this time we had &s;even fathom, at the next ca&s;t five, and at the next three, upon which we in&s;tantly dropped an anchor, that brought the &s;hip up. Pier Head the north we&s;t point of Thir&s;ty-Sound, bore S. E. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues, being half way between the i&s;lands which lie off the ea&s;t point of the we&s;tern inlet, and three &s;mall i&s;lands which lie directly without them. It was now the fir&s;t of the flood, which we found to &s;et N. W. by W. &frac12; W.; and having &s;ounded about the &s;hoal, upon which we had three fathom, and found deep water all round it, we got under &s;ail, and having hauled round the three i&s;lands that have been ju&s;t mentioned, came to an anchor under the lee of them, in fifteen fathom water; and the weather being dark, hazy, and rainy, we remained there till &s;even o'clock in the morning. At this time we got again under &s;ail, and &s;tood to the N. W. with a fre&s;h breeze at S. S. E.; having the main
<PB N="79" REF="013324_0368_0F8FFB948E97FE10">
land in &s;ight, and a number of i&s;lands all round us, &s;ome of which lay out at &s;ea as far as the eye could reach. The we&s;|tern inlet, which in the chart is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Broad Sound, we had now all open; at the entrance, is at lea&s;t nine or ten leagues wide: in it, and before it lie &s;everal i&s;lands, and probably &s;hoals al&s;o; for our &s;oundings were very irregular, varying &s;uddenly from ten to four fathom. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 21:29 S.; a point of land which forms the north we&s;t entrance into Broad Sound, and which I have named CAPE PALMERSTON, lying in latitude 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">:30, longitude 20:14 W. bore W. by N. di&s;tant three leagues. Our latitude was 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">:27, our longitude 210:57. Between this Cape and Cape Town&s;hend lies the bay which I have called the BAY OF INLETS. We continued to &s;tand to the N. W. and N. W. by N. as the land lay, under an ea&s;y &s;ail, having a boat ahead to &s;ound: at fir&s;t the &s;oundings were very irregular, from nine to four fathom; but afterwards they were regular, from nine to eleven. At eight in the evening, being about two leagues from the main land, we anchored in eleven fathom, with a &s;andy bottom; and &s;oon after we found the tide &s;etting with a &s;low motion to the we&s;tward. At one o'clock it was &s;lack or low-water; and at half an hour after 2 the &s;hip tended to the ea&s;tward, and rode &s;o till &s;ix in the mor|ning, when the tide had ri&s;en eleven feet. We now got un|der &s;ail, and &s;tood away in the direction of the coa&s;t, N. N. W. From what we had ob&s;erved of the tide during the night, it is plain, that the flood came from the N. W.; whereas the preceeding day, and &s;everal days before, it came from the S. E.; nor was this the fir&s;t, or even &s;econd time that we had remarked the &s;ame thing. At &s;un-ri&s;e this morning, we found the variation to be 6:45 E.; and in &s;teering along the &s;hore, between the i&s;land and the main, at the di&s;tance of about two leagues from the main, and three or four from the i&s;land, our &s;oundings were regular from twelve to nine fathom; but about eleven o'clock in the forenoon we were again embara&s;&s;ed in &s;hoal water, having at one time not more than three fathom; yet we got clear without ca&s;ting anchor. At noon we were about two leagues from the main, and four from the i&s;lands without us. Our latitude by ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ervation was 20:56, and a high promontory, which I named CAPE HILLSBOROUGH, bore W. &frac12; N. di&s;tant &s;even miles. The land here is diver&s;i|fied by mountains, hills, plains, and valleys, and &s;eems to be well clothed with herbage and wood: the i&s;lands which lie parallel to the coa&s;t, and from five to eight or nine miles di&s;|tant, are of various height and extent; &s;carcely any of them are more than five leagues in circumference, and many are not four miles: be&s;ides this chain of i&s;lands, which lie at a di&s;|tance from the coa&s;t, there are others much le&s;s, which lie un|der
<PB N="80" REF="013324_0369_0F90F2A4C22EF5C0">
the land, from which we &s;aw &s;moke ri&s;ing in different places. We continued to &s;teer along the &s;hore, at the di&s;|tance of about two leagues, with regular &s;oundings from nine to ten fathom. At &s;un-&s;et, the farthe&s;t point of the main bore N. 48 W. and to the northward of this lay &s;ome high land, which I took to be an i&s;land, and of which the north we&s;t point bore 41 W.; but not being &s;ure of a pa&s;&s;age, I came to an anchor about eight o'clock in the evening, in ten fathom water, with a muddy bottom. About ten we had a tide &s;et|ting to the northward, and at two it had fallen nine feet; after this it began to ri&s;e, and the flood came from the northward, in the direction of the i&s;lands which lay out to &s;ea; a plain in|dication that there was no pa&s;&s;age to the N. W. This how|ever had not appeared at day-break, when we got under &s;ail and &s;tood to the N. W. At eight o'clock in the morning, we di&s;covered low land quite acro&s;s what we took for an opening, which proved to be a bay, about five or &s;ix leagues deep; upon this we hauled our wind to the ea&s;tward round the north point of the bay, which at this time bore from us N. E. by N. di&s;tant four leagues: from this point we found the land trend way N. by W. &frac12; W, and a &s;treight or pa&s;&s;age between it and a large i&s;land, or i&s;lands, lying parallel to it. Having the tide of ebb in our favour, we &s;tood for this pa&s;&s;age; and at noon were ju&s;t within the entrance: our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 20:26 S.; Cape Hill&s;borough bore S. by E. di&s;tant ten leagues; and the north point of the bay S. 19 W. di&s;tant fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r miles. This point, which I named CAPE CONWAY, lies in latitude 26:36, S. longitude 211:28 W.; and the bay which lies between this cape and Cape Hill&s;borough I called REPULSE BAY. The greate&s;t depth of water which we found in it was thirteen fathom, and the lea&s;t eight. In all parts there was &s;afe anchorage, and I believe that, upon proper exa|mination, &s;ome good harbours would be found in it; e&s;pe|cially at the north &s;ide within Cape Conway; for ju&s;t within that cape there lie two or three &s;mall i&s;lands, which alone would &s;helter that &s;ide of the bay from the &s;outherly and &s;outh ea&s;terly winds, that &s;eem to prevail here as a T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ade. Among the many i&s;lands that lie upon this coa&s;t, there is one more re|markable than the re&s;t; it is of a &s;mall circuit, very high and peaked, and lies E. by S. ten miles from Cape Conway, at the &s;outh end of the pa&s;&s;age. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he afternoon we &s;teered through this pa&s;&s;age, which we found to be from three to &s;e|ven miles broad, and eight or nine leagues in length, N. by W. &frac12; W., S. by E. &frac12; E. It is formed by the main on the we&s;t, and by the i&s;lands on the ea&s;t, one of which is at lea&s;t five leagues in length: our depth of water in running through was from twenty to twenty-five fathom, with good anchorage every where, and the whole pa&s;&s;age may be con&s;idered as one:
<PB N="81" REF="013324_0370_0F90F2A6321EE308">
&s;afe harbour, exclu&s;ive of the &s;mall bays and coves which abound on each &s;ide, where &s;hips might lie as in a ba&s;on. The land both upon the main and i&s;lands is high, and diver&s;ified by hill and valley, wood and lawn, with a green and plea&s;ant appearance. On one of the i&s;lands we di&s;covered with our gla&s;&s;es two men and a woman, and a canoe with an outrigger, which appeared to be larger, and of a con&s;truction very diffe|rent from tho&s;e of bark tied together at the ends, which we had &s;een upon other parts of the coa&s;t; we hoped therefore that the people here had made &s;ome farther advances beyond mere animal life, than tho&s;e we had &s;een before. At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, we were nearly the length of the north end of the pa&s;&s;age; the north we&s;termo&s;t point of the main in fight bore N. 54<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> W. and the north end of the i&s;land N. N. E. with an open &s;ea between the two points. As this pa&s;&s;age was di&s;covered on Whit&s;unday, I called it WHITSUNDAY's PASSAGE, and I called the i&s;lands that form it CUMBERLAND ISLANDS, in honour of his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke. We kept under an ea&s;y &s;ail, with the lead going all night, being about three leagues from the &s;hore, and having from twenty-one to twenty-three fathom water. At day-break, we were abrea&s;t of the point which had been the farthe&s;t in fight to the north we&s;t the evening before, which I named CAPE GLOU|CESTER. It is a lofty promontory, in latitude 19:59 S. lon|gitude, 211:49 W. and may be known by an i&s;land which lies out at &s;ea N. by W. &frac12; W. at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix leages from it, and which I called HOLBORNE ISLE; there are al&s;o i&s;lands lying under the land between Holborne I&s;le, and Whit&s;unday's Pa&s;&s;age. On the we&s;t &s;ide of Cape Glou|ce&s;ter the land trends away S. W. and S. S. W. and forms a deep bay, the bottom of which I could but ju&s;t &s;ee from the ma&s;t-head: it is very low, and a continuation of the low land which we had &s;een at the bottom of Repul&s;e Bay. This bay I called EDGECUMBE BAY; but without &s;taying to look into it, we continued our cour&s;e to the we&s;tward, for the farthe&s;t land we could &s;ee in that direction, which bore W. by N. &frac12; N. and appeared very high. At noon we were about three leagues from the &s;hore, by ob&s;ervation in latitude 19:47 S. and Cape Glouce&s;ter bore S. 63 E. di&s;tant &s;even leagues and an half. At &s;ix in the evening, we were abrea&s;t of the we&s;|termo&s;t point ju&s;t mentioned, at about three miles di&s;tance, and becau&s;e it ri&s;es abruptly from the low lands which &s;urround it, I called it CAPE UPSTART. It lies in latitude 19:39 S. longitude 212:32 W. fourteen leagues W. N. W. from Cape Glouce&s;ter, and is of a height &s;ufficient to be &s;een at the di&s;|tance of twelve leagues: inland there are &s;ome high hills or mountains, which, like the Cape, afford but a barren pro|&s;pect. Having pa&s;&s;ed this Cape, we continued &s;tanding to
<PB N="82" REF="013324_0371_0F90F2A6572C30A0">
the W. N. W. as the land lay, under an ea&s;y &s;ail, having from &s;ixteen to ten fathom, till two o'clock in the morning, when we fell into &s;even fathom; upon which we hauled our wind to the northward, judging our&s;elves to be very near land: at day-break, we found our conjecture to be true, being within little more than two leagues of it. In this part of the coa&s;t the land, being very low, is nearer than it appears to be, though it is diver&s;ified with here and there a hill. At noon we were about four leagues from the land, in fifteen fathom water, and our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 19:12 S. Cape Up&s;tart bearing S. 32:30 E. di&s;tant twelve leagues. About this time &s;ome very large columns of &s;moke were &s;een ri&s;ing from the low lands. At &s;un-&s;et, the preceeding night, when we were clo&s;e under Cape Up&s;tart, the variation was nearly 9 E. and at &s;un-ri&s;e this day, it was no more than 5:35; I judged therefore that it had been influenced by iron ore, or other magnetical matter, contained under the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;teer W. N. W. as the land lay, with twelve or fourteen fathom water, till noon on the 6th, when our latitude by ob&s;ervation, was 19:1 S. and we had the mouth of a bay all open, extending from S. &frac12; E. to S. W. &frac12; S. di&s;tant two leagues. This bay, which named CLEAVE|LAND BAY, appeared to be about five or &s;ix miles in extent every way: the ea&s;t point I named CAPE CLEAVELAND, and the we&s;t, which had the appearance of an i&s;land, MAGNETI|CAL ISLE, as we perceived that the compa&s;s did not traver&s;e well when we were near it: they are both high, and &s;o is the main land within them, the whole forming a &s;urface the mo&s;t rugged, rocky, and barren of any we had &s;een upon the coa&s;t; it was not however without inhabitants, for we &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal parts of the bottom of the bay. The northermo&s;t land that was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight at this time, bore N. W. and it had the appearance of an i&s;land, for we could not trace the main land farther than W. by N. We &s;teered W. N. W. keeping the main land on board, the outermo&s;t part of which, at &s;un-&s;et, bore W. by N. but without it lay high land, which we judged not to be part of it. At day-break, we were abrea&s;t of the ea&s;tern part of this land, which we found to be a group of i&s;lands, lying about five leagues from the main: at this time, being between the two &s;hores, we advanced &s;lowly to the N. W. till noon, when our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 18:49 S. and our di&s;tance from the main about five leagues: the north we&s;t part of it bore from us N. by W. &frac12; W. the i&s;lands extending from N. to E. and the neare&s;t being di&s;tant about two miles: Cape Cleaveland bore S. 50 E. di&s;tant eighteen leagues. Our &s;oundings, in the cour&s;e that we had &s;ailed be|tween
<PB N="83" REF="013324_0372_0F90F2A70E8A1F48">
this time and the preceeding noon, were from fourteen to eleven fathom.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, we &s;aw &s;everal large columns of &s;moke upon the main; we &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome people and canoes, and upon one of the i&s;lands what had the appearance of cocoa nut-trees: as a few of the&s;e nuts would have been very acceptable, I &s;ent Lieutenant Hicks a&s;hore, and with him went Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, to &s;ee what refre&s;hment could be procured, while I kept &s;tanding in for the i&s;land with the &s;hip. About &s;even o'clock in the evening they returned, with an account that what we had taken for cocoa nut-trees, were a &s;mall kind of cabbage palm, and that, except about fourteen or fifteen plants, they had met with nothing worth bringing away. While they were a&s;hore, they &s;aw none of the people, but ju&s;t as they had put off, one of them came very near the beach, and &s;houted with a loud voice; it was &s;o dark that they could not &s;ee him, however they turned towards the &s;hore, but when he heard the boat putting back, he ran away or hid him&s;elf, for they could not get u glimp&s;e of him, and though they &s;houted, he made no reply. After the return of the boats, we &s;tood away N. by W. for the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight, of which we were abrea&s;t at three o'clock in the morning, hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed all the i&s;lands three or four hours before. This land, on account of its figure, I name POINT HILLOCK: it is of a con&s;iderable height, and may be known by a round hillock, or rock, which joins to the point, but appears to be detached from it. Between this cape and Magnetical i&s;le the &s;hore forms a large bay, which I called HALIFAX BAY: be|fore it lay the group of i&s;lands which has been ju&s;t mentioned, and &s;ome others, at a le&s;s di&s;tance from the &s;hore. By the&s;e i&s;lands the bay is &s;heltered from all winds, and it affords good anchorage. The land near the beach, in the bottom of the bay, is low and woody, but farther back it is one continued ridge of high land, which appeared to be barren and rocky. Having pa&s;&s;ed Point Hillock, we continued &s;tanding to the N. N. W. as the land trended, having the advantage of a light moon. At &s;ix, we were abrea&s;t of a point of land which lies N. by W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant eleven miles from Point Hillock, which I named CAPE SANDWICH. Between the&s;e two points the land is very high, and the &s;urface is craggy and barren. Cape Sandwich may be known not only by the high craggy land over it, but by a &s;mall i&s;land which lies ea&s;t of it, at the di&s;tance of a mile, and &s;ome others that lie about two leagues to the northward. From Cape Sandwich the lands trends W. and afterwards N. forming a fine large bay, which I called ROCKINGHAM BAY, where there appears to be good &s;helter, and good anchorage, but I did not &s;tay to examine it; I kept ranging along the &s;hore to the northward, for a clu&s;ter of &s;mall
<PB N="84" REF="013324_0373_0F90F2A7CD275EE0">
i&s;lands, which lie off the northern point of the bay. Between the three outermo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands, and the&s;e near the &s;hore, I found a channel about a mile broad, through which I pa&s;&s;ed, and upon one of the neare&s;t i&s;lands we &s;aw with our gla&s;&s;es about thirty of the natives, men, women, and children, all &s;tanding together, and looking with great attention at the &s;hip; the fir&s;t in&s;tance of curio&s;ity that we had &s;een among them: they were all &s;tark naked, with &s;hort hair, and of the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e complexion with tho&s;e that we had &s;een before. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 17:59, and we were abrea&s;t of the north point of Rockingham Bay, which bore from us W. at the di&s;tance of about two miles. This boun|dary of the bay is formed by an i&s;land of con&s;iderable height, which in the chart is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of DUNK ISLE, and which lies &s;o near the &s;hore as not to be ea&s;ily di&s;|tingui&s;hed from it. Our longitude was 213:57 W. Cape Sandwich bore S. by E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant nineteen miles, and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight N. &frac12; W.: our depth of water for the la&s;t ten hours had not been more than &s;ixteen, nor le&s;s than &s;even fathom. At &s;un-&s;et, the northern extremity of the land bore N. 25 W. and we kept our cour&s;e N. by W. along the coa&s;t, at the di&s;tance of between three and four leagues, with an ea&s;y &s;ail all night, having from twelve to fifteen fa|thom water.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we were abrea&s;t of &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands, which we called FRANKLAND's ISLES, and which lie about two leagues di&s;tant from the main land. The mo&s;t di&s;tant point in &s;ight to the northward bore N. by W. &frac12; W. and we thought it was part of the main, but afterwards found it to be an i&s;land of con&s;iderable height, and about four miles in circuit. Between this i&s;land and a point on the main, from which it is di&s;tant about two miles, I pa&s;&s;ed with the &s;hip. At noon, we were in the middle of the channel, and by ob&s;ervation in the latitude of 16:57 S. with 20 fathom wa|ter, the point on the man of which we were now abrea&s;t, I cal|led CAPE GRAFTON, its latitude is 16:57 S. and longitude 214:6 W. and the land here, as well as the whole coa&s;t for about twenty leagues to the &s;outhward, is high, has a rocky &s;urface, and is thinly covered with wood: during the night we had &s;een &s;everal fires, and about noon &s;ome people. Hav|ing hauled round Cape Grafton, we found the land trend away N. W. by W. and three miles the we&s;tward of the Cape we found a bay, in which we anchored about two miles from the &s;hore, in four fathom water, with an ouzey bottom. The ea&s;t point of the bay bore S. 74 E. the we&s;t point S. 83 W. and a low, green, woody i&s;land, which lies in the offing, N. 35 E. This i&s;land, which lies N. by E. &frac12; E. di&s;tant three or four

<P>As &s;oon as the &s;hip was brought to an anchor, I went a&s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. As my prin|cipal view was to procure &s;ome fre&s;h water, and as the bot|tom of the bay was low land covered with mangroves, where it was not probable fre&s;h water was to be found, I went out to|wards the cape, and found two &s;mall &s;treams, which however were rendered very difficult of acce&s;s by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;urf and rocks upon the &s;hore: I &s;aw al&s;o, as I came round the cape, a &s;mall &s;tream of water run over the beach, in a &s;andy cove, but I did not go in with the boat, becau&s;e I &s;aw that it would not be ea&s;y to land. When we got a&s;hore we found the country every where ri&s;ing into &s;teep rocky hills, and as no fre&s;h water could conveniently be procured, I was unwilling to lo&s;e time by going in &s;earch of lower land el&s;ewhere: we therefore made the be&s;t of our way back to the &s;hip, and about midnight we weighed and &s;tood to the N. W. having but little wind, with &s;ome &s;howers of rain. At four in the morning, the breeze fre&s;hened at S. by E. and the weather became fair: we continued &s;teering N. N. W. &frac12; W. as the land lay, at about three leagues di&s;tance, with ten, twelve, and fourteen fathom water. At ten we hauled off north, in order to get without a &s;mall low i&s;land, which lay about two leagues di&s;tant from the main, and great part of which at this time, it being high water, was overflowed: about three leagues to the north we&s;t of this i&s;land, clo&s;e under the main land, is another i&s;land, the land of which ri&s;es to a greater height, and which at noon bore from us N. 55 W. di&s;tant &s;even or eight miles. At this time our latitude was 16:20 S. Cape Grafton bore S. 29 E. di&s;tant 40 miles, and the northermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight N. 20 W.; our depth of water was fifteen fathom. Between this point and Cape Grafton, the &s;hore forms a large, but not a very deep bay, which being di&s;covered on Trinity Sunday, I called TRINI|TY BAY.</P>

<P>This Cape lies in latitude 16:6 S. and longitude 214:39 W. We &s;teered along the &s;hore N. by W. at the di&s;tance of between three and four leagues, having from fourteen to twelve, and ten fathom water: in the offing we &s;aw two i&s;lands, which lie in latitude 6 S. and about 6 or 7 leagues from the main. At &s;ix in the evening, the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. by W. &frac12; W. and 2 low woody i&s;lands, which &s;ome of us took to be rocks above water, bore N. &frac12; W. At this time we &s;hortened &s;ail, and hauled off &s;hore E. N. E. and N. E. by E. clo&s;e upon a wind, for it was my de&s;ign to &s;tretch off all night, as well to avoid the danger we &s;aw ahead, as to &s;ee whether any i&s;lands lay in the offing, e&s;pecially as we were now near the latitude a&s;&s;igned to the i&s;lands which were di&s;covered by Quiros, and which &s;ome geographers, for what rea&s;on I know not, have thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it to join to this land. We had the advantage of a fine breeze, and a clear moonlight night, and in &s;tanding off from &s;ix till near nine o'clock, we deepened our water from fourteen to twenty-one fathom, but while we were at &s;upper it &s;uddenly &s;hoaled, and we fell into twelve, ten, and eight fathom, with|in the &s;pace of a few minutes; I immediately ordered every body to their &s;tation, and all was ready to put about, and come to an anchor, but meeting at the next ca&s;t of the lead with deep water again, we concluded that we had gone over the tail of the &s;hoals, which we had &s;een at &s;un-&s;et, and that all dan|ger was pa&s;t: before ten we had twenty and one and twenty fathom, and this depth continuing, the gentlemen left the deck in great tranquility and went to bed; but a few minutes be|fore eleven, the water &s;hallowed at once from twenty to &s;even|teen fathom, and before the lead could be ca&s;t again, the &s;hip &s;truck, and remained immoveable, except by the heaving of the &s;urge, that beat her again&s;t the craggs of the rock upon which &s;he lay. In a few moments every body was upon deck, with countenances which &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed the horrors of our &s;ituation. We had &s;tood off the &s;hore three hours and an half, with a plea&s;ant breeze, and therefore knew that we could not be very near it, and we had too much rea&s;on to conclude that we were upon a rock of coral, which is more fatal than any other, becau&s;e the points of it are &s;harp, and every part of the &s;urface &s;o rough as to grind away whatever is rubbed again&s;t it, even with the gentle&s;t motion. In this &s;ituation all the &s;ails were immediately taken in, and the boats hoi&s;ted out to examine the depth of water round the &s;hip: we &s;oon di&s;|covered that our fears had not aggravated our misfortune, and
<PB N="87" REF="013324_0376_0F90F2A9F47A9200">
that the ve&s;&s;el had been lifted over a ledge of the rock, and lay in a hollow within it: in &s;ome places there was from three to four fathom, and in others not &s;o many feet. The &s;hip lay with her head to the N. E.; and at the di&s;tance of about thirty yards on the &s;tarboard &s;ide, the water deepened to eight, ten, and twelve fathom. As &s;oon as the long boat was out, we &s;truck our yards and top-ma&s;ts, and carried out the &s;tream anchor on the &s;tarboard bow, got the coa&s;ting anchor and cable into the boat, and were going to carry it out the &s;ame way; but upon &s;ounding a &s;econd time round the &s;hip, the water was found to be deepe&s;t a&s;tern: the anchor therefore was carried out from the &s;tarboard quarter, in&s;tead of the &s;tarboard bow, that is, from the &s;tern in&s;tead of the head, and having taken ground, our utmo&s;t force was applied to the cap&s;tern, hoping that if the anchor did not come home, the &s;hip would be go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> off, but to our great misfortune and di&s;appointment we could not move her: during all this time &s;he continued to beat with great vio|lence again&s;t the rock, &s;o that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that we kept upon our legs; and to complete the &s;cene of di&s;|tre&s;s, we &s;aw by the light of the moon the &s;heathing boards from the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el floating away all round her, and at la&s;t her fal&s;e keel, &s;o that every moment was making way for the &s;ea to ru&s;h in, which was to &s;wallow us up. We had now no chance to lighten her, and we had lo&s;t the opportunity of doing that to the greate&s;t advantage, for unhappily we went on &s;hore ju&s;t at high water, and by this time it had con&s;iderably fallen, &s;o that after &s;he &s;hould be lightened &s;o as to draw as much le&s;s water as the water had &s;unk, we &s;hould be but in the &s;ame &s;ituation as at fir&s;t; and the only alleviation of this cir|cum&s;tance was, that as the tide ebbed the &s;hip &s;ettled to the rocks, and was not beaten again&s;t them with &s;o much violence. We had indeed &s;ome hope from the next tide, but it was doubtful whether &s;he would hold together &s;o long, e&s;pecially as the rock kept grating her bottom under the &s;tarboard bow with &s;uch force as to be heard in the fore &s;tore-room. This however was no time to indulge conjecture, nor was any effort remitted in de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s: that no time might be lo&s;t, the water was immediately &s;tarted into the hold, and pumped up; &s;ix of our guns, being all we had upon the deck, our iron and &s;tone balla&s;t, ca&s;ks, hoops, &s;taves, oil jars, decayed &s;tores, and many other things that lay in the way of heavier materials were thrown over board with the utmo&s;t expedition, every one exerting him&s;elf with an alacrity almo&s;t approaching to cheer|fulne&s;s, without the lea&s;t repining or di&s;content; yet the men were &s;o far impre&s;t with a &s;en&s;e of their &s;ituation, that not an oath was heard among them, the habit of profanene&s;s, how|ever &s;trong, being in&s;tantly &s;ubdued, by the dread of incurring guilt, when death &s;eemed to be &s;o near.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="013324_0377_0F90503D78C1A1F0">
While we were thus employed, day broke upon us, and we &s;aw the land at about eight leagues di&s;tance, without any i&s;land in the intermediate &s;pace, upon which, if the &s;hip &s;hould have gone to pieces, we might have been &s;et a&s;hore by the boats, and from which they might have taken us by different turns to the main: the wind however gradually died away, and early in the forenoon it was a dead calm; if it had blown hard the &s;hip mu&s;t inevitably have been de&s;troyed. At 11 in the forenoon we expected high water, and anchors were got out, and every thing made ready for another effort to heave her off if &s;he &s;hould float, but to our inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urprize and concern &s;he did not float by &frac12; foot, though we had lightened her near fifty ton, &s;o much did the day-tide fall &s;hort of that in the night. We now proceeded to lighten her &s;till more, and threw overboard every thing that it was po&s;&s;ible for us to &s;pare: hitherto &s;he had not admitted much water, but as the tide fell, it ru&s;hed in &s;o fa&s;t, that two pumps, ince&s;&s;antly worked, could &s;carcely keep her free. At two o'clock &s;he lay heeling two or three &s;treaks to &s;tarboard, and the pinnace, which lay under her bows, touched the ground: we had now no hope but from the tide at midnight, and to prepare for it we carried out our two bower anchors, one on the &s;tarboard quarter, and the other right a-&s;tern, got the blocks and tackle which were to give us a purcha&s;e upon the cables in order, and brought the falls, or ends of them, in abaft, &s;training them tight, that the next effort might operate upon the &s;hip, and by &s;hortening the length of the cable between that and the anchors, draw her off the ledge upon which &s;he re&s;ted, towards the deep water. About five o'clock in the afternoon, we ob&s;erved the tide be|gin to ri&s;e, but we ob&s;erved at the &s;ame time that the leak in|crea&s;ed to a mo&s;t alarming degree, &s;o that two more pumps were manned, but unhappily only one of them would work: three of the pumps however were kept going, and at nine o'clock the &s;hip righted, but the leak had gained upon us &s;o con&s;iderably, that it was imagined &s;he mu&s;t go to the bottom as &s;oon as &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;ed to be &s;upported by the rock, this was a dread|ful circum&s;tance, &s;o that we anticipated the floating of the &s;hip not as an earne&s;t of deliverance, but as an event that would probably precipitate our de&s;truction. We well knew that our boats were not capable of carrying us all on &s;hore, and that when the dreadful cri&s;is &s;hould arrive, as all command and &s;ub|ordination would be at an end, a conte&s;t for preference would probably en&s;ue, that would encrea&s;e the horrors even of &s;hip|wreck, and terminate in the de&s;truction of us all by the hands of each other; yet we knew that if any &s;hould be left on board to peri&s;h in the waves, they would probably &s;uffer le&s;s upon the whole than tho&s;e who &s;hould get on &s;hore, without any

<P>To tho&s;e only who have waited in a &s;tate of &s;uch &s;u&s;pen&s;e, death has approached in all its terrors; and as the dreadful moment that was to determine our fate came on, every one &s;aw his own &s;en&s;ations pictured in the countenances of his compa|nions: however, the cap&s;tern and windlace were m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nned with as many hands as could be &s;pared from the pumps, and the &s;hip floating about twenty minutes after ten o'clock, the effort was made, and &s;he was heaved into deep water. It was &s;ome comfort to find that &s;he did not now admit more water than &s;he had done upon the rock; and though, by the gaining of the leak upon the pumps, there was no le&s;s than three feet nine inches water in the hold, yet the men did not relinqui&s;h their labour, and we held the water as it were at bay; but having now endured exce&s;&s;ive fatigue of body, and agitation of the mind, for more than four and twenty hours, and having but little hope of &s;ucceeding at la&s;t, they began to flag: none of them could work at the pump more than five or &s;ix minutes together, and then, being totally exhau&s;ted, they threw them|&s;elves down upon deck, though a &s;tream of water was running over it from the pumps between three and four inches deep; when tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded them had worked their &s;pell, and were exhau&s;ted in their turn, they threw them&s;elves down in the &s;ame manner, and the others &s;tarted up again, and renewed their labour; thus relieving each other till an accident was very near putting an end to their efforts at once. The plank|ing which lines the in&s;ide of the &s;hip's bottom is called the cieling, and between this, and the out&s;ide planking, there is a &s;pace of about eighteen inches: the man who till this time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad attended the well to take the depth of water, had taken it only to the cieling, and gave the mea&s;ure accordingly; but he being now relieved, the per&s;on who came in his &s;tead, reckon|ed the depth to the out&s;ide planking, by which it appeared in a few minutes to have gained upon the pumps eighteen inches: the difference between the planking without and within. Upon this, even the brave&s;t was upon the point of giving up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> labour with his hope, and in a few minutes every thing would have been involved in all the confu&s;ion of de&s;pair.

detected, and the &s;udden joy which every man felt upon find|ing his &s;ituation better than his fears had &s;ugge&s;ted, operated like a charm, and &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s him with a &s;trong belief that &s;car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e any real danger remained. New confidence and new hope, however founded, in&s;pired new vigour; and though our &s;tate was the &s;ame as when the men fir&s;t began to &s;lacken in their labour, through wearine&s;s and de&s;pondency, they now renewed their efforts with &s;uch alacrity and &s;pirit, that before eight o'clock in the morning the leak was &s;o far from having gained upon the pumps, that the pumps had gained con&s;iderably upon the leak. Every body now talked of getting the &s;hip into &s;ome harbour, as a thing not to be doubted, and as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could be &s;pared from the pumps, they were employed in getting up the anchors: the &s;tream anchor and be&s;t bower we had taken on board: but it was found impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave the little bower, and therefore it was cut away at a whole cable: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> lo&s;t the cable of the &s;tream anchor among the rocks; but in our &s;ituation the&s;e were trifles which &s;carcely at|tracted our notice. Our next bu&s;ine&s;s was to get up the fore-top-ma&s;t and fore-yard, and warp the &s;hip to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and at eleven, having now a breeze from the &s;ea, we once more got under &s;ail, and &s;tood for the land.</P>
<P>It was however impo&s;&s;ible long to continue the labour by which the pumps had been made to gain upon the leak, and as the exact &s;ituation of it could not be di&s;covered, we had no hope of &s;topping it within. In this &s;ituation, Mr. Monkhou&s;e, one of my mid&s;hipmen, came to me and propo&s;ed an expe|dient that he had once &s;een u&s;ed on board a merchant &s;hip, which &s;prung a leak that admitted above four feet water an hour, and which by this expedient was brought &s;afely from Virginia to London; the ma&s;ter having &s;uch confidence in it, that he took her out of harbour, knowing her condition, and did not think it worth while to wait till the leak could be otherwi&s;e &s;topped. To this man, therefore, the care of the expedient, which is called fothering the &s;hip, was immediate|ly committed, four or five of the people being appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and he performed it in this manner: He took a lower &s;tudding &s;ail, and having mixed together a large quan|tity of oakham and wool, chopped pretty &s;mall, he &s;titched i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> down in handfuls upon the &s;ail, as lightly as po&s;&s;ible, and over this he &s;pread the dung of our &s;heep and other filth; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hor&s;e dung if we had had it, would have been better. When the &s;ail was thus prepared, it was hauled under the &s;hip's bot|tom by ropes, which kept it extended, and when it came un|der the leak, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which carried in the water, carried in with it the oakham and wool from the &s;urface of the &s;ail, which in other parts the water was not &s;ufficiently agitated to wa&s;h off. By the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedient our leak was &s;o fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="91" REF="013324_0380_0F90F2ACE87AFDC8">
reduced, that in&s;tead of gaining upon three pumps, it was ea&s;ily kept under with one. This was a new &s;ource of confi|dence and comfort; the people could &s;carcely have expre&s;&s;ed more joy if they had been already in port; and their views were &s;o far from being limited to running the &s;hip a&s;hore in &s;ome harbour, either of an i&s;land or the main, and building a ve&s;&s;el out of her materials, to carry us to the Ea&s;t-Indies, which had &s;o lately been he utmo&s;t object of our hope, that nothing was now thought of but ranging along the &s;hore, in &s;earch of a convenient place to repair the damage &s;he had &s;u&s;tained, and then pro&s;ecuting the voyage upon the &s;ame plan as if no|thing had happened. Upon this occa&s;ion I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, both in ju&s;tice and gratitude to the &s;hip's company, and the Gentle|men on board, that although in the mid&s;t of our di&s;tre&s;s eve|ry one &s;eemed to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his danger, yet no pa&s;|&s;ionate exclamations, or frantic ge&s;tures, were to be heard or &s;een; every one appeared to have the perfect po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, and every one exerted him&s;elf to the uttermo&s;t, with a quiet and patient per&s;everance, equally di&s;tant from tumultu|ous violence of terror, and the gloomy inactivity of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>In the mean time, having light airs at E. S. E. we got up the main top-ma&s;t, and main-yard, and kept edging in for the land, till about &s;ix o'clock in the evening, when we came to an anchor in &s;eventeen fathom water, at the di&s;tance of &s;even leagues from the &s;hore, and one from the ledge of rocks upon which we had &s;truck.</P>
<P>This ledge or &s;hoal lies in latitude 15:45 S. and between &s;ix and &s;even leagues from the main. It is not however the only &s;hoal on this part of the coa&s;t, e&s;pecially to the north|ward; and at this time we &s;aw one to the &s;outhward, the tail of which we pa&s;&s;ed over, when we had uneven &s;oundings about two hours before we &s;truck. A part of this &s;hoal is always above water, and has the appearance of white &s;and: a part al&s;o of that upon which we had lain is dry at low water, and in that place con&s;i&s;ts of &s;and &s;tones; but all the re&s;t of it is a coral rock.</P>
<P>While we lay at anchor for the night, we found that the &s;hip made about fifteen inches of water an hour, from which no immediate danger was to be apprehended; and at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we weighed and &s;tood to the N. W. &s;till edging in for the land with a gentle breeze at S. S. E. At nine we pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e without two &s;mall i&s;lands that lie in la|titude 15:41 S. and about four leagues from the main: to reach the&s;e i&s;lands had, in the height of our di&s;tre&s;s, been the object of our hope, or perhaps rather of our wi&s;hes, and there|fore I called them HOPE ISLANDS. At noon we were about three leagues from the land, and in latitude 15:37 S.; the northermo&s;t part of the main in &s;ight bore N. 30 W.; and
<PB N="92" REF="013324_0381_0F90ECA0354E9B40">
Hope I&s;lands extended from S. 30 E. to S. 40 E. In this &s;ituation we had twelve fathom water, and &s;everal &s;and banks without us. At this time the leak had not increa&s;ed; but that we might be prepared for all events, we got the &s;ail ready for another fothering. In the afternoon having a gentle breeze at S. E. by E. I &s;ent out the ma&s;ter with two boats, as well to &s;ound ahead of the &s;hip, as to look out for a harbour where we might repair our defects, and put the &s;hip in a pro|per trim. At three o'clock we &s;aw an opening that had the appearance of an harbour, and &s;tood off and on while the boats examined it; but they &s;oon found that there was not depth of water in it &s;ufficient for the &s;hip. When it was near &s;un-&s;et, there being many &s;hoals about us, we anchored in four fathom, at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the &s;hore, the land ex|tending from N. &frac12; E. to S. by E. &frac12; E. The pinnace was &s;till out with one of the mates; but at nine o'clock &s;he returned, and reported, that about two leagues to the leward &s;he had di&s;covered ju&s;t &s;uch a harbour as we wanted, in which there was a &s;ufficient ri&s;e of water, and every other convenience that could be de&s;ired, either for laying the &s;hip a&s;hore, or heaving her down.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this information, I weighed at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, and having &s;ent two boats ahead, to lie upon the &s;hoals that we &s;aw in our way, we ran down to the place; but notwith&s;tanding our precaution, we were once in three fathom water. As &s;oon as the&s;e &s;hoals were pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;ent the boats to lie in the channel that led to the harbour, and by this time it began to blow. It was happy for us that a place of refuge was at hand; for we &s;oon found that the &s;hip would not work, having twice mi&s;&s;ed &s;tays: our &s;ituation, however, though it might have been much wor&s;e, was not without dan|ger; we were entangled among &s;hoals, and I had great rea&s;on to fear being driven to leeward, before the boats could place them&s;elves &s;o as to pre&s;cribe our cour&s;e. I therefore anchored in four fathom, about a mile from the &s;hore, and then made the &s;ignal for the boats to come on board. When this was done I went my&s;elf and buoyed the channel, which I found very narrow; the harbour al&s;o I found &s;maller than I expected, but mo&s;t excellently adapted to our purpo&s;e; and it is remark|able, that in the whole cour&s;e of our voyage we had &s;een no place which, in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, could have afforded us the &s;ame relief. At noon, our latitude was 15:26 S. Dur|ing all the re&s;t of this day, and the whole night, it blew too fre&s;h for us to venture from our anchor, and run into the har|bour; and for our farther &s;ecurity, we got down the top-gal|lant yards, unbent the main&s;ail, and &s;ome of the &s;mall &s;ails; got down the fore-top-gallant ma&s;t, and the gibb boom, and &s;prit-&s;ail, with a view to lighten the &s;hip forwards as much as

po&s;&s;ible, in order to come at her leak, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;omewhere in that part; for in all the joy of our unexpected deliverance, we had not forgot that at this time there was no|thing but a lock of wool between us and de&s;truction. The gale continuing, we kept our &s;tation all the fifteenth. On the 16th, it was &s;omewhat more moderate: and about &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e the cable &s;hort, with a de&s;ign to get under &s;ail, but were obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and veer it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut again. It is remarkable that the &s;ea breeze, which blew fre&s;h when we anchored, continued to do &s;o almo&s;t every day while we &s;tayed here; it was calm only while we were upon the rock, except once; and even the vale that afterwards wafted us to the &s;hore, would then certainly have beaten us to pieces. In the evening of the preceding day, we had ob&s;erved a fire near the beach over again&s;t us; and as it would be nece&s;&s;ary for us to &s;tay &s;ometime in this place, we were not without hope of making an acquaintance with the people. We &s;aw more fires upon the hills to-day, and with our gla&s;&s;es di&s;covered four In|dians going along the &s;hore, who &s;topped, and made two fires; but for what purpo&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould gue&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;curvy now began to make its appearance among us, with many formidable &s;ymptoms. Our poor Indian, Tupia, who had &s;ometime before complained that his gums were &s;ore and &s;welled, and who had taken plentifully of our lemon juice by the &s;urgeon's direction, had now livid &s;pots upon his legs, and other indubitable te&s;timonies that the di&s;ea&s;e had made a rapid progre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding all our remedies, among which the bark had been liberally admini&s;tered. Mr. Green, our a&s;tronomer, was al&s;o declining; and the&s;e, among other circum&s;tances, imbittered the delay which prevented our going a&s;hore.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 17th, though the wind was &s;till fre&s;h, we ventured to weigh, and pu&s;h in for the harbour; but in doing this we twice run the &s;hip aground: the fir&s;t time &s;he went off without any trouble, but the &s;econd time &s;he &s;tuck fa&s;t. We now got down the fore yard, fore top-ma&s;ts and booms, and taking them overboard, made a raft of them along&s;ide of the &s;hip. The tide was happily ri&s;ing, and about one o'clock in the afternoon &s;he floated. We &s;oon warped her into the harbour, and having moored her along-&s;ide of a &s;teep beach, to the &s;outh, we got the anchors, cables, and all the haw&s;ers on &s;hore before night.</P>

<P>IN the morning of Monday the 18, a &s;tage was made from the &s;hip to the &s;hore, which was &s;o bold that &s;he floated at twenty feet di&s;tance: two tents were al&s;o &s;et up, one for the &s;ick, and the other for &s;tores and provi&s;ions, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> were land|ed in the cour&s;e of the day. We al&s;o landed all the empty water ca&s;ks, and part of the &s;tores. As &s;oon as the tent for the &s;ick was got ready for their reception, they were &s;ent a&s;hore to the number of eight or nine, and the boat was di&s;patched to haul the &s;eine, in hopes of procuring &s;ome fi&s;h for their re|fre&s;hment; but &s;he returned without &s;ucce&s;s. In the mean time, climbed one of the highe&s;t hills among tho&s;e that over|looked the harbour, which afforded by no means a comfortable pro&s;pect: the low land near the river is wholly over-run with mangroves, among which the &s;alt water flows every tide; and the high land appeared to be every where &s;toney and barren. In the mean time Mr. Banks had al&s;o taken a walk up the country, and met with the frames of &s;everal old Indian hou&s;es, and places where they had dre&s;&s;ed &s;hell-fi&s;h; but they &s;eemed not to have been frequented for &s;ome months. Tupia, who had employed him&s;elf in angling, and lived intirely upon what he caught, recovered in a &s;urpri&s;ing degree; but Mr. Green &s;till continued to be extremely ill.</P>
<P>The next morning I got the four remaining guns out of the hold, and mounted them upon the quarter-deck; I al&s;o got a &s;pare anchor, and anchor &s;tock a&s;hore, and the remaining part of the &s;tores and balla&s;t that were in the hold: &s;et up the &s;mith's forge, and employed the armourer and his mate to make nails and other nece&s;&s;aries for the repair of the &s;hip. In the afternoon, all the officers &s;tores and the ground tier of water were got out; &s;o that nothing remained in the fore and main hold, but the coals, and a &s;mall quantity of &s;tone balla&s;t. This day Mr. Banks cro&s;&s;ed the river, to take a view of the country on the other &s;ide: he &s;ound it con&s;i&s;t principally of &s;and-hills, where he &s;aw &s;ome Indian hou&s;es, which appeared to have been very lately inhabited. In his walk, he met with va&s;t flocks of pigeons and crows: of the pigeons, which were exceedingly beautiful, he &s;hot &s;everal: but the crows, which were exactly like tho&s;e in England, were &s;o &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y that he could not get within reach of them.</P>

On the 20th we landed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> out the &s;tone balla&s;t and wood, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> draught of wa|ter to eight feet ten inches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> thirteen feet abaft; and this I thought, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that would be made by trimming the coals aft, would be &s;ufficient; for I found that the water ro&s;e and fell perpendicularly eight feet at the &s;pring tides: but as &s;oon as the coals were trimmed from over the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, we could hear the water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in a little abaft the forema&s;t, about the three feet from the keel: this determined me to clear the hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> entirely. This evening Mr. Banks ob&s;erved that in many parts of the inlet there were large quantities of pumice &s;tones, which lay at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance above high water mark; whither they might have been carried either by the fre&s;hes, or extraordinary high tides, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or there could be no doubt but that they came from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The next morning we went early to work, and by four o'clock in the afternoon had got out all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he coals, ca&s;t the moor|ings loo&s;e, and warped the &s;hip a little higher up the harbour, to a place which I thought mo&s;t convenient for laying her a&s;hore, in order to &s;top the leak. Her draught of water for|ward was now &s;even feet nine inches, and abaft thirteen feet &s;ix inches. At eight o'clock, it being high water, I hauled her bow clo&s;e a&s;hore; but kept her &s;tern afloat, becau&s;e I was afraid of neiping her; it was however nece&s;&s;ary to lay the whole of her as near the ground as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the morning of the 22d, the tide left her, and gave us an opportunity to examine her leak, which we found to be at her floor heads, a little before the &s;tarboard fore-chains, in this place the rocks had made their way through four planks, and even into the timbers; three more planks were much damaged, and the appearance of the&s;e breaches was very extraordinary: there was not a &s;plinter to be &s;een, but all was as &s;mooth, as if the whole had been cut away by an in&s;trument: the timbers in this place were happily very clo&s;e, and if they had not, it would have been ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;aved the &s;hip. But after all, her pre&s;ervation depended upon a circum&s;tance &s;till more re|markable: in one of the holes, which was big enough to have &s;unk us, if we had had eight pumps in&s;tead of four, and been able to keep them ince&s;&s;antly going, was in a great mea&s;ure plugged up by a fragment of the rock, which, after having made the wound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> left &s;ticking in it: &s;o that the water which at fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> upon our pumps, was what came in at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, between the &s;tone and the edges of the hole that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it.

the leak, con&s;iderable damage had been done to the bot|tom; great part of the &s;heathing was gone from under the lar|board bow; a con&s;iderable part of the fal&s;e keel was al&s;o want|ing, and the&s;e indeed we had &s;een &s;wim away in fragments from the ve&s;&s;el, while &s;he lay beating again&s;t the rock: the re|mainder of it was in &s;o &s;hattered a condition that it had bet|ter have been gone, and the fore foot and main keel were al&s;o damaged, but not &s;o as to produce any immediate danger: what damage &s;he might have received abaft could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> yet be exactly known; but we had rea&s;on to think it was not much, as but little water made its way into her bottom, while the tide kept below the leak, which has already been de&s;cribed. By nine o'clock in the morning the carpenters got to work upon her, while the &s;miths were bu&s;y in making bolts and nails. In the mean time, &s;ome of the people were &s;ent on the other &s;ide of the water to &s;hoot pigeons for the &s;ick, who at their return reported that they had &s;een an animal as large as a greyhound, of a &s;lender make, a mou&s;e colour, and ex|tremely &s;wift; they di&s;covered al&s;o many Indian hou&s;es, and a fine &s;tream of fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>The next morning I &s;ent a boat to haul the &s;eine; but at noon it returned with only three fi&s;h, and yet we &s;aw them in plenty lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing about the harbour. This day the carpenter fini&s;hed the repairs that were nece&s;&s;ary on the &s;tarboard &s;ide; and at nine o'clock in the evening, we heeled the &s;hip the other way, and hauled her off about two feet for fear of neiping. This day almo&s;t every body had &s;een the animal which the pigeon-&s;hooters had brought an account of the day before; and one of the &s;eamen, who had been rambling in the woods, told us at his return, that he verily believed he had &s;een the devil: we naturally enquired in what form he had appeared, and his an&s;wer was in &s;o &s;ingular &s;tile, that I &s;hall &s;et down his own words; <Q>He was (&s;ays John) as large as a one gal|lon keg, and very like it; he had horns and wings, yet he crept &s;o &s;lowly through the gra&s;s, that if I had not been <HI>afeard</HI> I might have touched him.</Q> This formidable appa|rition we afterwards di&s;covered to have been a batt; and the batts here mu&s;t be acknowledged to have a frightful appear|ance, for they are nearly black, and full as large as a part|ridge; they have indeed no horns, but the fancy of a man who thought he &s;aw the devil might ea&s;ily &s;upply that defect.</P>
<P>Early on the 24th the carpenters began to repair the &s;heath|ing under the larboard bow, where we found two planks cut about half through; and in the mean time I &s;ent a party of men, under the direction of Mr. Gore, in &s;earch of refre&s;hments for the &s;ick: this party returned about noon with a few palm cabbages, and a bunch or two of wild plantains; the plan|tains were the &s;malle&s;t I had ever &s;een, and the pulp, though
<PB N="97" REF="013324_0386_0F8FFB679C76DD80">
it was well ta&s;ted, was full of &s;mall &s;tones. As I was walk|ing this morning at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hip, I &s;aw my|&s;elf one of the animals which had been &s;o often de&s;cribed: it was of a light mou&s;e colour, and in &s;ize and &s;hape very much re&s;embling a greyhound; it had a long tail al&s;o, which it carri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> like a greyhound; and I &s;hould have taken it for a wild dog, if in&s;tead of running, it had not leapt like a hare or deer: its legs were &s;aid to be very &s;lender, and the print of its foot to be like that of a goat; but where I &s;aw it the gra&s;s was &s;o high that the legs were concealed, and the ground was too hard to receive the track. Mr. Banks al&s;o had an im|perfect view of this animal, and was of opinion that its &s;pe|cies was hitherto unknown.</P>
<P>After the &s;hip was hauled a&s;hore, all the water that came into her of cour&s;e went backwards; &s;o that although &s;he was dry forward, &s;he had nine feet water abaft: as in this part therefore her bottom could not be examined on the in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e, I took the advantage of the tide being out this evening to get the ma&s;ter and two of the men to go under her, and examine her whole larboard &s;ide without. They found the &s;heathing gone about the floor heads abrea&s;t of the mainma&s;t, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a plank a little damaged; but all agreed that &s;he had received no other material injury. The lo&s;s of her &s;heathing alone was a great misfortune, as the worm would now be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into her bottom, which might expo&s;e us to great inconvenience and danger; but as I knew no remedy for the mi&s;chief but heaving her down, which would be a work of immen&s;e labour and long time if practicable at all in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I was obliged to be content. The carpenters however conti|nued to work under her bottom in the evening till they were prevented by the tide; the morning tide did not ebb out far enough to permit them to work at all, for we had only one tolerable high and low tide in four and twenty hours, as indeed we had experienced when we lay upon the rock. The po&s;ition of the &s;hip, which threw the water in her abaft, was very near depriving the world of all the knowledge which Mr. Banks had endured &s;o much labour, and &s;o many ri&s;ks, to pro|cure; for he had removed the curious collection of plants, which he made during the whole voyage, into the bread room, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter part of the &s;hip, as a place of the greate&s;t &s;ecurity; and nobody having thought of the danger to which laying her head &s;o much higher than the &s;tern would expo&s;e them, they were this day found under water. Mo&s;t of them however were, by indefatigable care and attention, re&s;tored to a &s;tate of pre&s;ervation, but &s;ome were entirely &s;poilt and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The 25th was employed in filling water, and over-hauling the rigging, and at low water the carpenters fini&s;hed the re|pairs
<PB N="98" REF="013324_0387_0F90F214BB3A75D8">
under the larboard bow, and every other place which the tide would them permit to come at; &s;ome ca&s;ks were then la&s;hed under her bows to facilitate her floating, and at night, when it was high water, we endeavoured to heave her off, but without &s;ucce&s;s, for &s;ome of the ca&s;ks that were la&s;hed to her gave way.</P>
<P>The morning of the 26th was employed in getting more ca&s;ks ready for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and in the afternoon we la&s;hed no le&s;s than eight and thirty under the &s;hip's bottom, but to our great mortification the&s;e al&s;o proved ineffectual, and we found our&s;elves reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting till the next &s;pring-tide.</P>
<P>This day &s;ome of our gentlemen who had made an excur|&s;ion into the woods, brought home the leaves of a plant, which was thought to be the &s;ame that in the We&s;t-Indies is called coccos, but upon trial, the roots roved too acrid to be eaten; the leaves however were little inferior to &s;pinnage. In the place where the&s;e plants were gathered, grew plenty of the cabbage trees, which have occa&s;ionally been mentioned be|fore, a kind of wild plantain, the fruit of which was &s;o full of &s;tones as &s;carcely to be eatable; another fruit was al&s;o found about the &s;ize of a &s;mall golden pippin, but flatter, and of a deep purple colour: when fir&s;t gathered from the tree it was very hard and di&s;agreeable, but after being kept a few days became &s;oft, and ta&s;ted very much like an indifferent da|ma&s;cene.</P>
<P>The next morning we began to move &s;ome of the weight from the after-part of the &s;hip forward, to ea&s;e her; in the mean time the armourer continued to work at the forge, the carpenter was bu&s;y in caulking the &s;hip, and the men employ|ed in filling water and over-hauling the rigging: in the fore|noon, I went my&s;elf in the pinnace up the harbour, and made &s;everal hauls with the &s;eine, but caught only between twenty and thirty fi&s;h, which were given to the &s;ick and convale&s;cent.</P>
<P>On the 28th Mr. Banks went with &s;ome of the &s;eamen up the country, to &s;hew them the plant which in the We&s;t-In|dies is called Indian kale, and which &s;erved us for greens. Tupia had much meliorated the root of the coccos, by giving them a long dre&s;&s;ing in his country oven, but they were &s;o &s;mall that we did not think them an object for the &s;hip. In their walk they found one tree which had been notched for the con|venience of climbing it, in the &s;ame manner with tho&s;e we had &s;een in Botany Bay: they &s;aw al&s;o many ne&s;ts of white ants, which re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t-Indies, the mo&s;t perni|cious in&s;ects in the world. The ne&s;ts were of a pyramidical figure, from a few inches to &s;ix feet high, and very much re|&s;embled the &s;tones in England, which are &s;aid to be monu|ments of the Druids. Mr. Gore, who was al&s;o this day four
<PB N="99" REF="013324_0388_0F90F2159D850990">
or five miles up the country, reported that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had &s;een the foot&s;teps of men, and tracked animals of three or four different &s;orts, but had not been fortunate enough to &s;ee either man or bea&s;t.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the morning of the 29th, I ob&s;erved, in conjunction with Mr. Green, an emer&s;ion of Jupiter's fir&s;t &s;a|tellite; the time here was 2^h 18^m 53^<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">, which gave the longi|tude of this place 214^d 42^m 30^8 W.: its latitude is 15:26 S. At break of day, I &s;ent the boat out again with the &s;eine, and in the afternoon, it returned with as much fi&s;h as enabled me to give every man a pound and an half. One of my mid|&s;hipmen, an American, who was this day abroad with his gun, reported that he had &s;een a wolf, exactly like tho&s;e which he had been u&s;ed to &s;ee in his own country, and that he had &s;hot at it, but did not kill it.</P>
<P>The next morning, encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of the day before, I &s;ent the boat again to haul the &s;eine, and another party to gather greens: I &s;ent al&s;o &s;ome of the young gentle|men to take a plan of the harbour, and went my&s;elf upon a hill, which lies over the &s;outh point, to take a view of the &s;ea. At this time it was low water, and I &s;aw, with great concern innumerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and banks and &s;hoals lying all along the coa&s;t in every direction. The innermo&s;t lay about three or four miles from the &s;hore, the outermo&s;t extended as far as I could &s;ee with my gla&s;s, and many of them did but ju&s;t ri&s;e above water There was &s;ome appearance of a pa&s;&s;age to the northward, and I had no hope of getting clear but in that di|rection, for as the wind blows con&s;tantly from the S. E. it would have been difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible, to return back to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Mr. Gore reported, that he had this day &s;een two animals like dogs, of a &s;traw colour, that they ran like a hare, and were about the &s;ame &s;ize. In the afternoon the people returned from hauling the &s;eine, with &s;till better &s;ucce&s;s than before, for I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> now able to di&s;tribute two pounds and an half to each man: the greens that had been gathered I ordered to be boiled among the peas, and they made an excellent me&s;s, which, with two copious &s;upplies of fi&s;h afforded us un&s;peak|able refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>The next day, July the 1&s;t, being Sunday, every body had liberty to go a&s;hore, except one from each me&s;s, who were again &s;ent out with the &s;eine. The &s;eine was again equally &s;ucce&s;sful, and the people who went up the country gave an account of having &s;een &s;everal animals, though none of them were to be caught. They &s;aw a &s;ire al&s;o about a mile up the river, and Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, picked up the hu&s;k of a cocoa nut, which had been ca&s;t upon the beach, and was full of barnacles: this probably might come from &s;ome

i&s;land to windward, perhaps from the Terra del E&s;pirito San|to of Quiros, as we were now in the latitude where it is &s;aid to lie. This day the thermometer in the &s;hade ro&s;e to 87, which was higher than it had been on any day &s;ince we came upon this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, I &s;ent the ma&s;ter in the pinnace, out of the harbour, to &s;ound about the &s;hoals in the offing, and look for a channel to the northward: at this time we had a breeze from the land, which continued till about 9 o'clock, and was the fir&s;t we had had &s;ince our coming into the river. At low water we la&s;hed &s;ome empty ca&s;ks under the &s;hip's bows, having &s;ome hopes that as the tides were ri&s;ing &s;he would float the next high water. We &s;till continued to fi&s;h with great &s;ucce&s;s, and at high water we again attempted to heave the &s;hip off, but our utmo&s;t efforts were &s;till ineffectual.</P>
<P>The next day at noon, the ma&s;ter returned, and reported, that he had found a pa&s;&s;age out to &s;ea between the &s;hoals, and de&s;cribed its &s;ituation. The &s;hoals, he &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of coral rocks, many of which were dry at low water, and upon one of which he had been a&s;hore. He found here &s;ome cockles of &s;o enormous a &s;ize that one of them was more than two men could eat, and a great variety of other &s;hell fi&s;h, of which he brought us a plentiful &s;upply: in the evening, he had al&s;o landed in a bay about three leagues to the northward of our &s;tation, where he di&s;turbed &s;ome of the natives who were at &s;upper: they all fled with the greate&s;t precipitation at his ap|proach, leaving &s;ome fre&s;h &s;ea eggs, and a fire ready kindled behind them, but there was neither hou&s;e nor hovel near the place. We ob&s;erved, that although the &s;hoals that lie ju&s;t within &s;ight of the coa&s;t, abound with &s;hell-fi&s;h, which may be ea&s;ily caught at low water; yet we &s;aw no &s;uch &s;hells about the fire-places on &s;hore. This day an allegator was &s;een to &s;wim about the &s;hip for &s;ome time, and at high water we made an other effort to float her, which happily &s;ucceeded: we found however that by lying &s;o long with her head a-ground, and her &s;tern a-float, &s;he had &s;prung a plank between decks, a-brea&s;t of the main chains, &s;o that it was become nece&s;&s;ary to lay her a&s;hore again.</P>
<P>The next morning was employed in trimming her upon an even keel, and in the afternoon, having warped her over, and waited for high water, we laid her a&s;hore on the &s;and bank, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river, for the damage &s;he had received already from the great de&s;cent of the ground, made me afraid to lay her broad-&s;ide to the &s;hore in the &s;ame place, from which we had ju&s;t floated her. I was now very de&s;irous to make an|other trial to come at her bottom, where the &s;heathing had been rubbed off, but though &s;he had &s;carcely four feet water under her, when the tide was out, yet that part was not dry.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="013324_0390_0F90F2170C995780">
On the 5th, I got one of the carpenter's crew, a man in whom I could confide, to go down again to the &s;hip's bottom, and examine the place. He reported, that three &s;treaks of the &s;heathing, about eight feet long, were wanting, and that the main plank had been a little rubbed; this account per|fectly agreed with the report of the ma&s;ter, and others, who had been under her bottom before: I had the comfort how|ever to find the carpenter of opinion that this would be of little con&s;equence, and therefore, the other damage being repaired, &s;he was again floated at high water, and moored along &s;ide the beach, where the &s;tores had been depo&s;ited; we then went to work to take the &s;tores on board, and put her in a condi|tion for the &s;ea. This day, Mr. Banks cro&s;&s;ed to the other &s;ide of the harbour, where, as he walked along a &s;andy beach, he found innumerable fruits, and many of them &s;uch as no plants which he had di&s;covered in this country produced: among others were &s;ome cocoa nuts, which Tupia &s;aid had been open|ed by a kind of crab, which from his de&s;cription we judged to be the &s;ame that the Dutch call <HI>Beurs Krabbe,</HI> and which we had not &s;een in the&s;e &s;eas. All the vegetable &s;ub&s;tances which he found in this place, were encru&s;ted with marine productions, and covered with barnacles; a &s;ure &s;ign that they mu&s;t have come far by &s;ea, and, as the trade-wind blows right upon the &s;hore, probably from Terra del E&s;pirito Santo, which has been mentioned already.</P>
<P>The next morning, Mr. Banks, with Lieutenant Gore, and three men &s;et out in a &s;mall boat up the river, with a view to &s;pend two or three days in an excur&s;ion, to examine the coun|try, and kill &s;ome of the animals which had been &s;o often &s;een at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 7th, I &s;ent the ma&s;ter again out to &s;ound about the &s;hoals, the account which he had brought me of a channel being by no means &s;atisfactory; and we &s;pent the remainder of this day, and the morning of the next, in fi&s;hing, and other nece&s;&s;ary occupations.</P>
<P>About four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Banks and his par|ty returned, and gave us an account of their expedition. Having proceeded about three leagues among the &s;wamps and mangroves, they went up into the country, which they found to differ but little from what they had &s;een before: they pur|&s;ued their cour&s;e therefore up the river, which at length was contracted into a narrow channel, and was bounded, not by &s;wamps and mangroves, but by &s;teep banks, that were covered with trees of a mo&s;t beautiful verdure, a|mong which was that which in the We&s;t Indies is called <HI>Mohoe,</HI> or the bark tree, the <HI>hibi&s;cus tiliaceus;</HI> the land with|in was in general low, and had a thick covering of long gra&s;s: the &s;oil &s;eemed to be &s;uch as promi&s;ed great fertility, to any who &s;hould plant and improve it. In the cour&s;e of
<PB N="102" REF="013324_0391_0F90F217B05634E0">
the day, Tupia &s;aw an animal, which, by his de&s;cription, Mr. Banks judged to be a wolf: they al&s;o &s;aw three other animals, but could neither catch nor kill one of them, and a k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d of bat, as large as a partridge, but this al&s;o eluded all their diligence and &s;kill. At night, they took up their lodg|ing clo&s;e to the banks of the river, and made a fire, but the mu&s;quitos &s;warmed about them in &s;uch numbers, that their quarters were almo&s;t untenable; they followed them into the &s;moke, and almo&s;t into the fire, which, hot as the climate was, they could better e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dure than the &s;tings of the&s;e in&s;ects, which were an intolerable torment. The fire, the flies, and the want of a better bed than the ground, rendered the night extremely uncomfortable, &s;o that they pa&s;&s;ed it not in &s;leep, but in re&s;tle&s;s wi&s;hes for the return of day. With the fir&s;t dawn they &s;et out in &s;earch of game, and in a walk of ma|ny miles, they &s;aw four animals of the &s;ame kind, two of which Mr. Banks's greyhound fairly cha&s;ed, but they threw him out at a great di&s;tance, by leaping over the long thick gra&s;s, which prevented his running: this animal was ob&s;erved not to run upon four legs, but to bound or hop forward upon two, like the <HI>Jerbua,</HI> or <HI>Mus Jaculus.</HI> About noon, they re|turned to the boat, and again proceeded up the river, which was &s;oon contracted into a fre&s;h water brook, where, however, the tide ro&s;e to a con&s;iderable height: as evening approached, it became low water, and it was then &s;o &s;hallow that they were obliged to get out of the boat and drag her along, till they could find a place in which they might, with &s;ome hope of re&s;t, pa&s;s the night. Such a place at length offered, and while they were getting the things out of the boat, they ob&s;erved a &s;moke at the di&s;tance of about a furlong: as they did not doubt but that &s;ome of the natives, with whom they had &s;o long and earne&s;tly de&s;ired to become per&s;onally acquainted, were about the fire, three of the party went immediately towards it, hope|ing that &s;o &s;mall a number would not put them to flight: when they came up to the place, however, they found it de|&s;erted, and therefore they conjectured that before they had di&s;|covered the Indians, the Indians had di&s;covered them. They found the fire &s;till burning, in the hollow of an old tree that was become touch-wood, and &s;everal branches of trees newly broken down, with which children appeared to have been playing: they ob&s;erved al&s;o many foot-&s;teps upon the &s;and, below high water mark, which were certain indications that the Indians had been recently upon the &s;pot. Several hou&s;es were found at a little d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ance, and &s;ome ovens dug in the ground, in the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anner as tho&s;e of Otaheite, in which victuals appeared to have been dre&s;&s;ed &s;ince the morning, and &s;cattered about them, lay &s;ome &s;hells of a kind of clamm, and &s;ome fragments of roots, the refu&s;e of the meal. After regret|ting
<PB N="103" REF="013324_0392_0F90F21CB7D15268">
their di&s;appointment, they repaired to their quarters, which was a broad &s;and bank, under the &s;helter of a bu&s;h. Their beds were plantain leaves, which they &s;pread upon the &s;and, and which were as &s;oft as a mattre&s;s; their cloaks &s;erved them for bed-clothes, and &s;ome bunches of gra&s;s for pillows: with the&s;e accommodations they hoped to pa&s;s a better night than the la&s;t, e&s;pecially as, to their great comfort, not a mu&s;|quito was to be &s;een. Here then they lay down, and, &s;uch is the force of habit, they re&s;igned them&s;elves to &s;leep, without once reflecting upon the probability and danger of being found by the Indians in that &s;ituation. If this appears &s;trange, let us for a moment reflect, that every danger, and every cala|mity, after a time becomes familiar, and lo&s;es its effect upon the mind. If it were po&s;&s;ible that a man &s;hould fir&s;t be made acquainted with his mortality, or even with the inevitable debility and infirmities of old age, when his under&s;tanding had arrived at its full &s;trength, and life was endeared by the en|joyments of youth, and vigour, and health, with what an ago|ny of terror and di&s;tre&s;s would the intelligence be received! yet, being gradually acquainted with the&s;e mournful truths, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, we &s;carce know when they lo&s;e all their force, and we think no more of the approach of old age and death, than the&s;e wanderers of an unknown de&s;art did of a le&s;s obvious and certain evil, the approach of the native &s;a|vages, at a time when they mu&s;t have fallen an ea&s;y prey to their malice or their fears. And it is remarkable that the greater part of tho&s;e who have been condemned to &s;uffer a vio|lent death, have &s;lept the night immediately preceeding their execution, though there is perhaps no in&s;tance of a per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed of a capital crime having &s;lept the fir&s;t night of his confinement. Thus is the evil of life in &s;ome degree a reme|dy for it&s;elf, and though every man at twenty deprecates four|&s;core, almo&s;t every man is as tenacious of life at four&s;core as at twenty; and if he does not &s;uffer under any painful di&s;order, lo&s;es as little of the comforts that remain by reflecting that he is upon the brink of the grave, where the earth already crumb|les under his feet, as he did of the plea&s;ures of his better days, when his di&s;&s;olution, though certain, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Our travellers having &s;lept, without once awaking, till the morning, examined the river, and finding the tide favour|ed their return, and the country promi&s;ed nothing worthy of a farther &s;earch, they reimbarked in their boat, and made the be&s;t of their way to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Soon after the arrival of this party, the ma&s;ter al&s;o re|turned, having been &s;even leagues out to &s;ea, and he was now of opinion, that there was no getting out where before he thought there had been a pa&s;&s;age; his expedition however was
<PB N="104" REF="013324_0393_0F90F2220BC100B0">
by no means without its advantage, for having been a &s;e|cond time upon the rock where he had &s;een the large cockles, he met with a great number of turtle, three of which he caught, that together weighed &s;even hundred and ninety-one pounds, though he had no better in&s;trument than a boat-hook.</P>
<P>The next morning therefore, I &s;ent him out again, with proper in&s;truments for taking them, and Mr. Banks went with him, but the &s;ucce&s;s did not at all an&s;wer our expectations, for, by the unaccountable conduct of the officer, not a &s;ingle turtle was taken, nor could he be per&s;uaded to return: Mr. Banks, however, went a&s;hore upon the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ef, where he &s;aw &s;e|veral of the large cockles, and having collected many &s;hells, and marine productions, he returned at eleven o'clock at night, in his own &s;mall boat, the ma&s;ter &s;till continuing with the large one upon the rock. In the afternoon, &s;even or eight of the natives had appeared on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river, and two of them came down to the &s;andy point, oppo&s;ite to the &s;hip; but upon &s;eeing me put off in a boat, to &s;peak with them, they all ran away with the greate&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>As the the ma&s;ter continued ab&s;ent with the boat all night, I was forced to &s;end the &s;econd lieutenant for him, early the next morning in the yawl; and &s;oon after four of the natives appeared upon the &s;andy point, on the north &s;ide of the river, having with them a &s;mall wooden canoe, with out-riggers: they &s;eemed for &s;ome time to be bu&s;ily employed in &s;triking fi&s;h: &s;ome of our people were for going over to them in a boat, but this I would by no means permit, repeated experience having convinced me that it was more likely to prevent, than procure an interview. I was determined to try what could be done by a contrary method, and accordingly let them alone, without appearing to take the lea&s;t notice of them: this &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that at length two of them came in the canoe within a mu&s;ket &s;hot of the &s;hip, and there talked a great deal in a very loud tone: we under&s;tood nothing that they &s;aid, and there|fore could an&s;wer their harangue only by &s;houting, and mak|ing all the &s;igns of invitation and kindne&s;s that we could de|vi&s;e. During this conference, they came, in&s;en&s;ibly, nearer and nearer, holding up their lances, not in a threatning man|ner, but as if to intimate that if we offered them any injury, they had weapons to revenge it. When they were almo&s;t along-&s;ide of us, we threw them &s;ome cloth, nails, beads, pa|per, and &s;ome other trifles, which they received without the lea&s;t appearance of &s;atisfaction: at la&s;t, one of the people hap|pened to throw them a &s;mall fi&s;h; at this they expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t joy imaginable, and intimating, by &s;igns, that they would fetch their companions, immediately paddled away to|wards the &s;hore. In the mean time &s;ome of our people, and among them Tupia, landed on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river:
<PB N="105" REF="013324_0394_0F90F223871B65A0">
the canoe, with all the four Indians, very &s;oon returned to the &s;hip, and came quite along-&s;ide, without expre&s;&s;ing any fear or di&s;tru&s;t. We di&s;tributed &s;ome more pre&s;ents among them, and &s;oon after they left us, and landed on the &s;ame &s;ide of the river where our people had gone a&s;hore: every man carried in his hand two lances, and a &s;tick, which is u&s;ed in throwing them, and advanced to the place where Tupia and the re&s;t of our people were &s;itting; Tupia &s;oon prevailed upon them to lay down their arms, and come forward without them: he then made &s;igns that they &s;hould &s;it down by him, with which they complied, and &s;eemed to be under no apprehen&s;ion or con|&s;traint: &s;everal more of us then going a&s;hore, they expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome jealou&s;y le&s;t we &s;hould get between them and their arms; we took care however to &s;hew them that we had no &s;uch inten|tion, and having joined them, we made them &s;ome more pre|&s;ents, as a farther te&s;timony of our good-will, and our de&s;ire to obtain theirs. We continued together, with the utmo&s;t cordiality, till dinner time, and then giving them to under|&s;tand that we were going to eat, we invited them, by &s;igns, to go with us: this however they declined, and as &s;oon as we le&s;t them, they went away in their canoe. One of the&s;e men was &s;omewhat above the middle age, the other three were young; they were in general of the common &s;tature, but their limbs were remarkably &s;mall; their &s;kin was of the colour of wood &s;oot, or what would be called a dark chocolate colour; their hair was black, but not woolly; it was &s;hort cropped, in &s;ome lank, and in others curled. Dampier &s;ays, that the people whom he &s;aw on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of this country, wanted two of their fore-teeth, but the&s;e had no &s;uch defect: &s;ome part of their bodies had been painted red, and the upper lip and brea&s;t of one of them was painted with &s;treaks of white; which he called <HI>Carbanda;</HI> their features were far from di&s;|agreeable, their eyes were lively, and their teeth even and white, their voices were &s;oft and tuneable, and they repeated many words after us with great facility. In the night, Mr. Gore and the ma&s;ter returned with the long-boat, and brought one turtle and a few &s;hell-fi&s;h. The yawl had been left upon the &s;hoal with fix men, to make a farther trial for turtle.</P>
<P>The next morning we had another vi&s;it from four of the na|tives; three of them had been with us before, but the fourth was a &s;tranger, who&s;e name, as we learnt from his companions, who introduced him, was YAPARICO. This gentleman was di&s;tingui&s;hed by an ornament of a very &s;triking appearance; it was the bone of a bird, nearly as thick as a man's finger, and five or &s;ix inches long, which he had thru&s;t into a hole, made in the gri&s;tle that divides the no&s;trils; of this we had &s;een one in&s;tance, and only one, in New Zealand; but upon examination, we found that among all the&s;e people this part
<PB N="106" REF="013324_0395_0F90F223B808CD88">
of the no&s;e was perforated, to receive an ornament of the &s;ame kind: they had al&s;o holes in their ears, though nothing was then hanging to them, and had bracelets upon the upper part of their arms, made of plaited hair, &s;o that, like the inhabi|tants of Terra del Fuego, they &s;eem to be fond of ornament, though they are ab&s;olutely without apparel; and one of them, to whom I had given part of an old &s;hirt, in&s;tead of throwing it over any part of his body, tied it as a fillet round his head. They brought with them a fi&s;h, which they gave us, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, in return for the fi&s;h we had given them the day be|fore. They &s;eemed to be much plea&s;ed, and in no ha&s;te to leave us, but &s;eeing &s;ome of our gentlemen examine their ca|noe with great curio&s;ity and attention, they were alarmed, and jumping immediately into it, paddled away without &s;peaking a word.</P>
<P>About two the next morning, the yawl, which had been left upon the &s;hoal, returned with three turtles and a large &s;keat. As it &s;eemed now probable that this fi&s;hery might be pro&s;ecuted with advantage, I &s;ent her out again, after break|fa&s;t, for a further &s;upply. Soon after, three Indians ventured down to Tupia's tent, and were &s;o well plea&s;ed with their re|ception, that one of them went with the canoe to fetch two others whom we had never &s;een: when he returned he intro|duced the &s;trangers by name, a ceremony which, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, was never omitted. As they had received the fi&s;h that was thrown into their canoe, when they fir&s;t approached the &s;hip, with &s;o much plea&s;ure, &s;ome fi&s;h was offered to them now, and we were greatly &s;urprized to &s;ee that it was received with the greate&s;t indifference: they made &s;igns, however, to &s;ome of the people, that they &s;hould dre&s;s it for them, which was immediately done, but after eating a little of it, they threw the re&s;t to Mr. Banks's dog. They &s;taid with us all the fore|noon, but would never venture above twenty yards from their canoe. We now perceived that the colour of their &s;kin was not &s;o dark as it appeared, what we had taken for their com|plexion, being the effects of dirt and &s;moke, in which, we imagined, they contrived to &s;leep, notwith&s;tanding the heat of the climate, as the only means in their power to keep off the mu&s;quitos. Among other things that we had given them when we fir&s;t &s;aw them, were &s;ome medals, which he had hung round their necks by a riband; and the&s;e ribands were &s;o changed by &s;moke, that we could not ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h of what colour they had been: this incident led us more nar|rowly to examine the colour of their &s;kin. While the&s;e people were with us, we &s;aw two others on the point of land that lay on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, at the di&s;tance of about two hundred yards, and by our gla&s;&s;es di&s;covered them to be a woman and a boy; the woman, like the re&s;t, being &s;tark
<PB N="107" REF="013324_0396_0F90F225324260F8">
naked. We ob&s;erved, that all of them were remarkably clean limbed, and exceedingly active and nimble. One of the&s;e &s;trangers had a necklace of &s;hells, very prettily made, and a bracelet upon his arm, formed of &s;everal &s;trings, &s;o as to re|&s;emble what in England is called gymp: both of them had a piece of bark tied over the forehead, and were disfigured by the bone in the no&s;e. We thought their language more har&s;h than that of the i&s;landers in the South Sea, and they were con|tinually repeating the word <HI>chercau,</HI> which we imagined to be a term expre&s;&s;ing admiration, by the manner in which it was uttered: they al&s;o cried out, when they &s;aw any thing new, <HI>cher, tut, tut, tut, tut!</HI> which probably had a &s;imilar &s;ignifi|cation. Their canoe was not above ten feet long, and very narrow, but it was fitted with an outrigger, much like tho&s;e of the i&s;lands, tho' in every re&s;pect very much inferior: when it was in &s;hallow water, they &s;et it on with poles, and when in deep, they worked it with paddles about four feet long: it contained ju&s;t four people, &s;o that the people who vi&s;ited us to|day went away at two turns. Their lances were like tho&s;e that we had &s;een in Botany Bay, except that they had but a &s;ingle point, which in &s;ome of them was the &s;ting of the ray, and barbed with two or three &s;harp bones of the &s;ame fi&s;h: it was indeed a mo&s;t terrible weapon, and the in&s;trument which they u&s;ed in throwing it, &s;eemed to be formed with more art than any we had &s;een before. About twelve o'clock next day, the yawl returned, with another turtle: and a large &s;ting-ray, and in the evening was &s;ent out again.</P>
<P>The next morning, two of the Indians came on board, but after a &s;hort &s;tay, went along the &s;hore, and applied them&s;elves with great diligence to the &s;triking of fi&s;h. Mr. Gore, who went out this day with his gun, had the good fortune to kill one of the animals which had been &s;o much the &s;ubject of our &s;peculation: In form, it is mo&s;t like the gerbua, which it al&s;o re&s;embles in its motion, as has been ob&s;erved al|ready, but it greatly differs in &s;ize, the gerbua not being lar|ger than a common rat, and this animal, when full grown, being as big as a &s;heep: this individual was a young one, much under its full growth, weighing only thirty-eight pounds. The head, neck, and &s;houlders, are very &s;mall in proportion to the other parts of the body; the tail is nearly as long as the body, thick near the rump, and tapering towards the end: the fore-legs of this individual were only eight inches long, and the hind-legs two and twenty: its progre&s;s is by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive leaps or hops, of a great length, in an erect po&s;ture; the fore|legs are kept bent clo&s;e to the brea&s;t, and &s;eemed to be of u&s;e only for digging: the &s;kin is covered with a &s;hort fur, of a dark mou&s;e or grey colour, excepting the head and ears, which

<P>The next day, our Kanguroo was dre&s;&s;ed for dinner, and proved mo&s;t excellent meat; we might now indeed be &s;aid to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, for we had turtle in great plenty, and we all agreed that they were much better than any we had ta&s;ted in England, which we imputed to their being eaten fre&s;h from the &s;ea, before their natural fat had been wa&s;ted, or their juices changed by a diet and &s;ituation &s;o different from what the &s;ea affords them, as garbage and a tub. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e that we caught here, were of the kind called green turtle, and weighed from two to three hundred weight, and when the&s;e were killed, they were always found to be full of turtle gra&s;s, which our naturali&s;ts took to be a kind of <HI>conferva:</HI> two of them were loggerheads, the fle&s;h of which was much le&s;s delicious, and in their &s;tomachs nothing was to be found but &s;hells.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 16th, while the people were employed as u&s;ual in getting the &s;hip ready for the &s;ea, I climbed one of the hills on the north &s;ide of the river, from which I had an exten&s;ive view of the inland country, and found it agreeably diver&s;ified by hills, vallies, and large plains, which in many places were richly covered with wood. This evening we ob&s;erved an emer&s;ion of Jupiter's fir&s;t &s;atellite, which gave 214&deg; 53&prime; 45&Prime; of longitude. The ob&s;ervation which was made on the 29th of June gave 214&deg; 42&prime; 30&prime;; the mean is 214&deg; 48&prime; 7&frac12;&Prime;, the longitude of this place we&s;t of Greenwich.</P>
<P>On the 17th, I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter and one of the mates in the pinnace, to look for a channel to the northward; and I went my&s;elf with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander into the woods, on the other &s;ide of the water. Tupia, who had been thither by him&s;elf, reported, that he had &s;een three Indians who had given him &s;ome roots, about as thick as a man's finger, in &s;hape not much unlike a rhadi&s;h, and of a very agreeable ta&s;te. This induced us to go over, hoping that we &s;hould be able to improve our acquaintance with the natives: in a very little time we di&s;covered four of them in a canoe, who, as &s;oon as they &s;aw us, came a&s;hore, and, though they were all &s;trangers, walked up to us, without any &s;igns of &s;u&s;picion or fear. Two of the&s;e had necklaces of &s;hells, which we could not per&s;uade them to part with for any thing we could give them: we pre|&s;ented them however with &s;ome beads, and after a &s;hort &s;tay they departed. We attempted to follow them, hoping that they would conduct us to &s;ome place where we &s;hould find more of them, and have an opportunity of &s;eeing their woman; but they made us under&s;tand, by &s;igns, that they did not de&s;ire our company. At eight o'clock next morning, we were vi&s;ited by &s;everal of the natives, who were now become quite familiar.
<PB N="109" REF="013324_0398_0F8FFB68491FC508">
One of them, at our de&s;ire, threw his lance, which was about eight feet long: it flew with a &s;wiftne&s;s and &s;teadine&s;s that &s;urpri&s;ed us, and though it was never more than four feet from the ground, it entered deeply into a tree at fifty paces di&s;tance. After this they ventnred on board, where I left them, to all appearance much entertained, and went again with Mr. Banks to take a view of the country; but chiefly to indulge an anxious curio&s;ity, by looking round us upon the &s;ea, of which our wi&s;hes almo&s;t per&s;uaded us we had formed an idea more di&s;advantageous than the truth. After having walked about &s;even or eight miles along the &s;hore to the northward, we a&s;cended a very high hill, and were &s;oon convinced that the danger of our &s;ituation was at lea&s;t equal to our apprehen&s;ions; for in whatever direction we turned our eyes, we &s;aw rocks and &s;hoals without num|ber, and no pa&s;&s;age out to &s;ea, but through the winding channels between them, which could not be navigated with|out the la&s;t degree of difficulty and danger. We returned therefore to the &s;hip, not in better &s;pirits than when we left it; we found &s;everal natives &s;till on board, and we were told that the turtles, of which we had then no le&s;s than twelve upon the deck, had fixed their attention more than any thing el&s;e in the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 19th in the morning, we were vi&s;ited by ten of the natives, the greater part from the other &s;ide of the river, where we &s;aw &s;ix or &s;even more, mo&s;t of them women, and like all the re&s;t of the people we had &s;een in this country, they were &s;tark naked. Our gue&s;ts brought with them a greater number of lances than they had ever done before, and hav|ving laid them up in a tree, they &s;et a man and a boy to watch them: the re&s;t then came on board, and we &s;oon per|ceived that they had determined to get one of our turtle, which was probably as great a dainty to them as to us. They fir&s;t a&s;ked us, by &s;igns, to give them one; and being refu&s;ed, they expre&s;&s;ed, both by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ooks and ge&s;tures, great di&s;&s;appointment and anger. At this time we happened to have no victuals dre&s;&s;ed, but I offered one of them &s;ome bi&s;|cuit, which he &s;natched and threw overboard with great di&s;|dain. One of them renewed his reque&s;t to Mr. Banks, and upon a refu&s;al &s;tamped with his foot, and pu&s;hed him from him in a tran&s;port of re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ment and indignation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing applied by turns to almo&s;t every per&s;on who appeared to have any command in the &s;hip, without &s;ucce&s;s, they &s;ud|denly &s;eized two of the turtles, and dragged them towards the &s;ide of the &s;hip where their canoe lay: our people &s;oon forced them out of their hands, and replaced them with the re&s;t. They would not however relinqui&s;h their enterpri&s;e but made &s;everal other attempts of the &s;ame kind, in all

which being equally di&s;appointed, they &s;uddenly leaped into their canoe in a rage, and began to paddle towards the &s;hore. At the &s;ame time, I went into the boat with Mr. Banks, and five or &s;ix of the &s;hip's crew, and we got a&s;hore before them, where many more of our people were already en|gaged in various employments; as &s;oon as they landed, they &s;eized their arms, and, before we were aware of their de|&s;ign, they &s;natched a brand from under a pitch kettle which was boiling, and maki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g a circuit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the windward of the few things we had on &s;hore, they &s;et &s;ire to the gra&s;s in their way, with &s;urpri&s;ing quickne&s;s and dexterity: the gra&s;s, which was five or &s;ix feet high, and as dry as &s;tubble, burnt with amazing fury; and the fire made a rapid progre&s;s to|wards a tent of Mr. Banks's, which had been &s;et up for Tupia when he was &s;ick, taking in its cour&s;e a &s;ow and pigs, one of which it &s;corched to death. Mr. Banks leaped into a boat, and fetched &s;ome people from on board, ju&s;t time enough to &s;ave his tent, by hauling it down upon the beach; but the &s;mith's forge, at lea&s;t &s;uch part of it as would burn, was con&s;umed. While this was doing, the Indians went to a place at &s;ome di&s;tance, where &s;everal of our people were wa&s;hing, and where our nets, among which was the &s;eine, and a great quantity of linen, were laid out to dry; here they again &s;et fire to the gra&s;s, entirely di&s;regarding both threats and entreaties. We were therefore obliged to di&s;|charge a mu&s;quet, loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, at one of them, which drew blood at the di&s;tance of about forty yards, and this putting them to flight, we extingui&s;hed the fire at this place before it had made much progre&s;s; but where the gra&s;s had been fir&s;t kindled, it &s;pread into the woods to a great di&s;tance. As the Indians were &s;till in &s;ight, I fired a mu&s;quet, charged with ball, abrea&s;t of them among the mangroves, to convince them that they were not yet out of our reach: upon hearing the ball they quickened their pace, and we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of them. We thought they would now give us no more trouble; but &s;oon after we heard their voices in the woods, and perceived they came nearer and nearer. I &s;et out, therefore, with Mr. Banks and 3 or 4 more, to meet them: when our parties came in &s;ight of each other, they halted; ex|cept one old man who came forward to meet us: at length he &s;topped, and having uttered &s;ome words, which we were very &s;orry we could not under&s;tand, he went back to his compa|nions, and the whole body &s;lowly retreated. We found means however to &s;eize &s;ome of their darts, and continued to follow them about a mile: we then &s;at down upon &s;ome rock, from which we could ob&s;erve their motions, and they al&s;o &s;at down at about an hundred yards di&s;tance. After a &s;hort time, the old man again advanced towards us, carrying in his hand a
<PB N="111" REF="013324_0400_0F90F226B8771FB8">
lance without a point: he &s;topped &s;everal times, at different di&s;tances, and &s;poke; we an&s;wered by beckoning and making &s;uch &s;igns of amity as we could devi&s;e; upon which the me&s;|&s;enger of peace, as we &s;uppo&s;ed him to be, turned and &s;poke aloud to his companions, who then &s;et up their lances again&s;t a tree, and advanced to us in a friendly manner: when they came up, we returned the darts or lances that we had taken from them, and we perceived with great &s;atisfaction that this rendered the reconciliation complete. We found in this party four per&s;ons whom we had never &s;een before, who as u&s;ual were introduced to us by name; but the man who had been wounded in the attempt to burn our nets and linen, was not among them; we knew however that he could not be danger|ou&s;ly hurt, by the di&s;tance at which the &s;hot reached him. We made all of them pre&s;ents of &s;uch trinkets as we had about us, and they walked back with us towards the &s;hip: as we went along, they told us, by &s;igns, that they would not &s;et fire to the gra&s;s any more; and we di&s;tributed among them &s;ome mu&s;quet balls, and endeavoured to make them under|&s;tand their u&s;e and effect. When they came abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, they &s;at down, but could not be prevailed upon to come on board; we therefore left them, and in about two hours they went away, &s;oon after which we perceived the woods on fire at about two miles di&s;tance. If this accident had happened a very little while &s;ooner, the con&s;equence might have been dreadful; for our powder had been aboard but a few days, and the &s;tore tent, with many valuable things, which it contained, had not been removed many hours. We had no idea of the fury with which gra&s;s would burn in this hot climate, nor con|&s;equently of the difficulty of extingui&s;hing it; but we deter|mined, that if it &s;hould ever again be nece&s;&s;ary for us to pitch our tents in &s;uch a &s;ituation, our fir&s;t mea&s;ure &s;hould be to clear the ground round us.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we got every thing on board the &s;hip, new birthed her, and let her &s;wing with the tide; and at night the ma&s;ter returned, with the di&s;couraging account that there was no pa&s;&s;age for the &s;hip to the northward.</P>
<P>The next morning, at low water, I went and &s;ounded, and bouyed the bar, the &s;hip being now ready for the &s;ea. We &s;aw no Indians this day, but all the hills round us for many miles were on fire, which at night made a mo&s;t &s;triking and beautiful appearance.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t pa&s;&s;ed without our getting &s;ight of any of the in|habitants, and indeed without a &s;ingle incident worth notice. On the 22d, we killed a turtle for the day's provi&s;ion, upon opening which we found a wooden harpoon, or turtle peg, about as thick as as man's finger, near fifteen inches long, and bearded at the end, &s;uch as we had &s;een among the natives,
<PB N="112" REF="013324_0401_0F90F22778B46B20">
&s;ticking through both &s;houlders: it appeared to have been &s;truck a con&s;iderable time, for the wound had perfectly healed up over the weapon.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 23d, I &s;ent &s;ome people into the country, to gather a &s;upply of the greens which have been before mentioned by the name of Indian Kale; and one of them having &s;traggled from the re&s;t, &s;uddenly fell in with four Indians, three men and a boy, whom he did not &s;ee till, by turning &s;hort in the wood, he found him&s;elf among them. They had kindled a fire, and were broiling a bird of &s;ome kind, and part of a Kanguroo, the remainder of which, and a cocka|too, hung at a little di&s;tance upon a tree: the man, being un|armed, was at fir&s;t greatly terrified; but he had the pre&s;ence of mind not to run away, judging very rightly, that he was mo&s;t likely to incur danger by appearing to apprehend it; on the contrary, he went and &s;at down by them, and, with an air of chearfulne&s;s and good humour, offered them his knife, the only thing he had about him which he thought would be acceptable to them; they received it, and having handed it from one to the other, they gave it him again: he then made an offer to leave them; but this they &s;eemed not di&s;po&s;ed to permit: &s;till however he di&s;&s;embled his fears, and &s;at down again; they con&s;idered him with great attention and curio&s;ity, particularly his clothes, and then felt his hands and face, and &s;atisfied them&s;elves that his body was of the &s;ame texture with their own. They treated him with the greate&s;t civility, and having kept him about half an hour, they made &s;igns that he might depart: he did not wait for a &s;econd di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, but when he left them, not taking the direct way to the &s;hip, they came from their fire and directed him; &s;o that they well knew whence he came.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mr. Banks, having made an excur&s;ion on the other &s;ide of the river, to gather plants, found the greate&s;t part of the cloth that had been given to the Indians, lying in a heap together, probably as u&s;ele&s;s lumber, not worth carrying away; and perhaps, if he had &s;ought further, he might have found the other trinkets; for they &s;eemed to &s;et very little value upon any thing we had, except our turtle, which was a commodity that we were lea&s;t able to &s;pare.</P>
<P>The blowing weather, which prevented our attempt to get out to &s;ea, &s;till continuing, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went again out on the 24th to &s;ee whether any new plant could be picked up: they traver&s;ed the woods all day without &s;ucce&s;s; but as they were returning through a deep valley, the &s;ides of which, though almo&s;t as perpendicular as a wall, were covered with trees and bu&s;hes; they found lying upon the ground &s;eve|ral marking nuts, the <HI>Anacardium orientale;</HI> the&s;e put them upon a new &s;cent, and they made a mo&s;t diligent &s;earch after
<PB N="113" REF="013324_0402_0F90F228571D6778">
the tree that bore them, which perhaps no European botani&s;t ever &s;aw; but to their great mortification they could not find it: &s;o that, after &s;pending much time, and cutting down four or five trees, they returned quite exhau&s;ted with fatigue to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 25th, having made an excur&s;ion up the river, I found a canoe belonging to our friends the Indians, whom we had not &s;een &s;ince the affair of the turtle; they had left it tied to &s;ome mangroves, about a mile di&s;tant from the &s;hip, and I could &s;ee by their fires that they were retired at lea&s;t &s;ix miles directly inland.</P>
<P>As Mr. Banks was again gleaning the country for his natu|ral hi&s;tory on the 26th, he had the good fortune to take an ani|mal of the <HI>Opo&s;&s;um</HI> tribe: it was a female, and with it he took two young ones: it was found much to re&s;emble the remarkable animal of the kind, which Mons. de Buffon has de&s;cribed in his natural hi&s;tory by the name of <HI>Phalanger,</HI> but it was not the &s;ame. Mons. Buffon &s;uppo&s;es this tribe to be peculiar to America, but in this he is certainly mi&s;taken; and probably, as Pallas has ob&s;erved in his Zoology, the Phalanger it&s;elf is a native of the Ea&s;t Indies, as the animal which was caught by Mr. Banks re&s;embled in the extraordinary conformation of the feet, in which it differs from animals of every other tribe.</P>
<P>On the 27th, Mr. Gore &s;hot a Kanguroo, which, with the &s;kin, entrails, and head, weighed eighty-four pounds. Upon examination, however, we found that this animal was not at its full growth, the innermo&s;t grinders not being yet formed. We dre&s;&s;ed it for dinner the next day; but to our great di&s;ap|pointment, we found it had a much wor&s;e flavour than that we had eaten before.</P>
<P>The wind continued in the &s;ame quarter, and with the &s;ame violence, till five o'clock in the morning of the 29th. when it fell calm; &s;oon after a light breeze &s;prung up from the land, and it being about two hours ebb, I &s;ent a boat to &s;ee what wa|ter was upon the bar; in the mean time we got the anchor up, and made all ready to put to &s;ea. But when the boat came back, the officer reported that there was only thirteen feet water upon the bar, which was &s;ix inches le&s;s than the &s;hip drew. We were therefore obliged to come to, and the &s;ea breeze &s;etting in again about eight o'clock, we gave up all hope of &s;ailing that day.</P>
<P>We had fre&s;h gales at S. E. with hazy weather and rain, till two in the morning of the 31&s;t, when the weather being &s;omething more moderate, I had thoughts of trying to warp the &s;hip out of the harbour; but upon going out my&s;elf fir&s;t in the boat, I found it &s;till blow too fre&s;h for the attempt. During all this time the pinnace and yawl continued to ply the net and hook with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s; &s;ometimes taking a
<PB N="114" REF="013324_0403_0F90F228F6975B68">
turtle, and frequently bringing in from two to three hundred weight of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, the carpenter examined the pumps, and, to our great mortification, found them all in a &s;tate of decay, owing, as he &s;aid, to the &s;aps having been left in the wood; one of them was &s;o rotten as, when hoi&s;ted up, to drop to pieces, and the re&s;t were little better; &s;o that our chief tru&s;t was now in the &s;oundne&s;s of our ve&s;&s;el, which happily did not admit more than one inch of water in an hour.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning of Friday the third, we made another un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to warp the &s;hip out of the har|bour; but at five o'clock in the morning of the 4th, our ef|forts had a better effect, and about &s;even, we got once more under &s;ail, with a light air from the land, which &s;oon died away, and was followed by the &s;ea-breezes from S. E. by S. with which we &s;tood off to &s;ea E. by N. having the pinnace ahead, which was ordered to keep &s;ounding continually. The yawl had been &s;ent to the turtle bank, to take up the net which had been left there; but as the wind fre&s;hened we got out before her. A little before noon we anchored in fifteen fathom water, with a &s;andy bottom; for I did not think it &s;afe to run in among the &s;hoals, till I had well viewed them, at low-water, from the ma&s;t-head, which might determine me which way to &s;teer: for as yet I was in doubt whether I &s;hould beat back to the &s;outhward, round all the &s;hoals, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a pa&s;&s;age to the ea&s;tward or the northward, all which at pre|&s;ent appeared equally difficult and dangerous. When we were at anchor the harbour from which we &s;ailed bore S. 70 W. di&s;tant about five leagues; the northermo&s;t point of the main in &s;ight, which I named CAPE BEDFORD, and which lies in latitude 15&deg; 16&prime; S., longitude 214&deg; 45&prime; W., bore N. 20 W. di&s;tant three leagues and a half; but to the N. E. of this cape we could &s;ee land which had the appearance of two high i&s;lands: the turtle banks bore ea&s;t, di&s;tant one mile: our la|titude by ob&s;ervation was 15&deg; 32&prime; S. and our depth of water in &s;tanding off from the land was from three and an half to fifteen fathom.</P>

<P>TO the harbour which we now had left, I gave the name of ENDEAVOUR RIVER. It is only a &s;mall bar har|bour,
<PB N="115" REF="013324_0404_0F90F229B9A71820">
or creek, which runs in a winding channel, three or four leagues inland, and at the head of which there is a &s;mall brook of fre&s;h water: there is no depth of water for &s;hipping above a mile within the bar, and at this di&s;tance only on the north &s;ide, where the bank is &s;o &s;teep for near a quarter of a mile, that a &s;hip may lie afloat at low water, &s;o near the &s;hore as to reach it with a &s;tage, and the &s;ituation is extremely convenient for heav|ing down; but at low water, the depth upon the bar is not more than nine or ten feet, nor more than &s;eventeen or eigh|teen at the height of the tide; the difference between high and low water, at &s;pring tides, being about nine feet. At the new and full of the moon it is high water between nine and ten o'clock: it mu&s;t al&s;o be remembered, that this part of the coa&s;t is &s;o barricaded with &s;hoals, as to make the harbour &s;till more difficult of acce&s;s; the &s;afe&s;t approach is from the &s;outh|ward, keeping the main land clo&s;e upon the board all the way. Its &s;ituation may always be found by the latitude, which has been very accurately laid down. Over the &s;outh point is &s;ome high land, but the north point is formed by a low &s;andy beach, which extends about three miles to the northward, where the land begins again to be high.</P>
<P>The chief refre&s;hment that we procured here, was turtle, but as they were not to be had without going five leagues out to &s;ea, and the weather was frequently tempe&s;tuous, we did not abound with this dainty: what we caught, as well as the fi&s;h, was always equally divided among us all by weight, the meane&s;t per&s;on on board having the &s;ame &s;hare as my&s;elf; and I think every commander, in &s;uch a voyage as this, will find it his intere&s;t to follow the &s;ame rule. In &s;everal parts of the &s;andy beaches, and &s;and hills near the &s;ea, we found pur&s;|lain, and a kind of bean that grows upon a &s;talk, which creeps along the ground: the pur&s;lain we found very good when it was boiled, and the beans are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, for we found them of great &s;ervice to our &s;ick: the be&s;t greens, however, that could be procured here, were the tops of the coccos, which have been mentioned already, as known in the We&s;t-Indies by the name of <HI>Indian kale:</HI> the&s;e were, in our opinion, not much inferior to &s;pinnage, which, in ta&s;te, they &s;omewhat re&s;emble; the roots indeed are not good, but they might pro|bably be meliorated by proper cultivation. They are found here chiefly in boggy ground. The few cabbage palms that we meet with, were in general &s;mall, and yielded &s;o little cabbage that they were not worth &s;eeking.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the kanguroo, and the oppo&s;&s;um that have been al|ready mentioned, and a kind of polecat, there are wolves upon this part of the coa&s;t, if we were not deceived by the tracks upon the ground, and &s;everal &s;pecies of &s;erpents; &s;ome of the &s;er|pents are venemous, and &s;ome harmle&s;s; there are no tame
<PB N="116" REF="013324_0405_0F90F22B379A0A10">
animals here except dogs, and of the&s;e we &s;aw but two or three, which frequently came about the tents, to pick up the &s;craps and bones that happened to lie &s;cattered near them. There does not indeed &s;eem to be many of any animal, except the kanguroo; we &s;carcely &s;aw any other above once, but this we met with almo&s;t every time we went into the woods. Of land fowls we &s;aw crows, kites, haws, cokatoos of two &s;orts, one white and the other black, a very beautiful kind of loriquets, &s;ome parrots, pigeons of two or three &s;orts, and &s;everal &s;mall birds not known in Europe. The water fowls are herns, whi&s;tling ducks, which perch, and I believe, roo&s;t upon trees, wild gee&s;e, curlieus, and a few others, but the&s;e do not abound. The face of the country, which has been occa&s;ionally men|tioned before, is agreeably diver&s;ified by hill and valley, lawn and wood. The &s;oil of the hills is hard, dry and &s;tony, yet it produces coar&s;e gra&s;s be&s;ides wood: the &s;oil of the plains and vallies is in &s;ome places &s;and, and in &s;ome clay; in &s;ome al&s;o it is rocky and &s;tony, like the hills; in general, however, it is well clothed, and has at lea&s;t the appearance of fertility. The whole country, both hill and valley, wood and plain, abounds with ant hills, &s;ome of which are &s;ix or eight feet high, and twice as much in circumference. The trees here are not of many &s;orts; the gum tree, which we found on the &s;outhern part of the coa&s;t, is the mo&s;t common, but here it is not &s;o large: on each &s;ide of the river, through its whole cour&s;e, there are mangroves in great numbers, which, in &s;ome places, extend a mile within the coa&s;t. The country is in all parts well watered, there being &s;everal fine rivulets at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other, but none in the place where we lay, at lea&s;t not during the time we were there, which was the dry &s;ea&s;on; we were however well &s;upplied with water by &s;prings, which were not far off.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the 4th, we had a gentle breeze at S. E. and clear weather, but as I did not intend to &s;ail till the morn|ing, I &s;ent all the boats to the reef, to get what turtle and &s;hell fi&s;h they could. At low water, I went up to the ma&s;t|head, and took a view of the &s;hoals, which made a very threatening appearance: I could &s;ee &s;everal at a remote di&s;|tance, and part of many of them was above water. The &s;ea appeared mo&s;t open to the north ea&s;t of the turtle reef, and I came to a re&s;olution to &s;tretch out that way, clo&s;e upon a wind, becau&s;e if we &s;hould find no pa&s;&s;age, we could always return the way we went. In the evening the boats brought in a turtle, a &s;ting-ray, and as many large cockles as came to about a pound and a half a man, for in each of them there was not le&s;s than two pounds of meat: in the night al&s;o we caught &s;everal &s;harks, which, though not a dainty, were an accep|table increa&s;e of our fre&s;h provi&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="013324_0406_0F90F22C1EB2D748">
In the morning I waited till half ebb before I weighed, be|cau&s;e at that time the &s;hoals begin to appear, but the wind then blew &s;o hard that I was obliged to remain at anchor: in the afternoon, however, the gale becoming more moderate, we got under &s;ail, and &s;tood out upon a wind N. E. by E. leaving the turtle reef to windward, and having the pinnace &s;ounding ahead: we had not kept this cour&s;e long, before we di&s;covered &s;hoals before us, and upon both the bows; and at half an hour after four, having run about eight miles, the pinnace made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water, where we little expected it: upon this we tacked, and &s;tood on and off, while the pinnace &s;tretched farther to the ea&s;tward, and night approaching, I came to an anchor in twenty fathom water, with a muddy bottom. Endeavour river then bore S. 52 W. Cape Bedford W. by N. &frac12; N. di&s;tant five leagues, the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight, which had the appearance of an i&s;land, N.; and a &s;hoal, a &s;mall &s;andy part of which appeared above water, bore N. E. di&s;tant between 2 and 3 miles: in &s;tanding off from turtle reef to this place, we had from fourteen to twenty fathom water, but when the pinnace was about a mile farther to the E. N. E. there was no more than four or five feet water, with rocky ground; and yet this did not appear to us in the &s;hip. In the morning of the 6th, we had a &s;trong gale, &s;o that in&s;tead of weighing, we were obliged to veer away more cable, and &s;trike our top-gallant yards. At low water, my&s;elf, with &s;everal of the officers, kept a look-out at the ma&s;t-head, to &s;ee if any pa&s;&s;age could be di&s;covered between the &s;hoals, but nothing was in view except breakers, extending from the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">round by the E. as far as N. W. and out to &s;ea beyond the reach of our &s;ight; the&s;e breakers, however, did not appear to be cau&s;ed by one continual &s;hoal, but by &s;everal, which lay detached from each other: on that which lay farthe&s;t to the ea&s;tward, the &s;ea broke very high, which made me think it was the out|ermo&s;t, for upon many of tho&s;e within, the breakers were in|con&s;iderable, and from about half ebb to half flood, they were not to be &s;een at all, which makes &s;ailing among them &s;till more dangerous, e&s;pecially as the &s;hoals here con&s;i&s;t prin|cipally of coral rocks, which are as &s;teep as a wall; upon &s;ome of them however, and generally at the north end, there are patches of &s;and, which are covered only at high water, and which are to be di&s;cerned at &s;ome di&s;tance. Being now con|vinced that there was no pa&s;&s;age to &s;ea, but through the laby|rinth formed by the&s;e &s;hoals, I was altogether at a lo&s;s which way to &s;teer, when the weather &s;hould permit us to get under &s;ail. It was the Ma&s;ter's opinion, that we &s;hould beat back the way we came, but this would have been an endle&s;s labour, as the wind blew &s;trongly from that quarter, almo&s;t without intermi&s;&s;ion; on the other hand, if no pa&s;&s;age could be found
<PB N="118" REF="013324_0407_0F90F22CC2C13EF8">
to the northward, we &s;hould be compelled to take that mea&s;ure at la&s;t. The&s;e anxious deliberations engaged us till eleven o'clock at night, when the &s;hip drove, and obliged us to veer away to a cable and one third, which brought her up; but in the morning, the gale increa&s;ing, &s;he drove again, and we therefore let go the &s;mall bower, and veered away to a whole cable upon it, and two cables on the other anchors, yet &s;he &s;till drove though not &s;o fa&s;t; we then got down top-gallant ma&s;ts, and &s;truck the yards and top-ma&s;ts clo&s;e down, and at la&s;t had the &s;atisfaction to find that &s;he rode. Cape Bedford now bore W. S. W. di&s;tant three leagues and an half, and in this &s;ituation we had &s;hoals to the ea&s;tward, extending from the S. E. by S. to the N. N. W. the neare&s;t of which was about two miles di&s;tant. As the gale continued with little re|mi&s;&s;ion, we rode till &s;even o'clock in the morning of the 10th, when, it being more moderate, we weighed, and &s;tood in for the land, having at length determined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;eek a pa&s;&s;age along the &s;hore to the northward, &s;till keeping the boat ahead: during our run in we had from nineteen to twelve fathom: after &s;tanding in about an hour, we edged away for three &s;mall i&s;lands that lay N. N. E. &frac12; E. three leagues from Cape Bed|ford, which the ma&s;ter had vi&s;ited while we were in port. At nine o'clock we were abrea&s;t of them, und between them and the main: between us and the main there was another low i&s;land, which lies N. N. W. four miles from the three i&s;lands; and in this channel we had fourteen fathom water. The nor|thermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight now bore N. N. W. &frac12; W. di&s;|tant about two leagues. Four or five leagues to the north of this head land, we &s;aw three i&s;lands, near which lay &s;ome that were &s;till &s;maller, and we could &s;ee the &s;hoals and reefs without us, extending to the northward, as far as the&s;e i&s;lands: between the&s;e reefs and the head land, we directed our cour&s;e, leaving to the ea&s;tward a &s;mall i&s;land, which lies N. by E. di&s;tant four miles from the three i&s;lands. At noon, we were got between the head land and the three i&s;lands: from the head land we were di&s;tant two leagues, and from the i&s;lands four; our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 14&deg; 51&prime;. We now thought we &s;aw a clear opening before us, and hoped that we were once more out of danger; in this hope, however, we &s;oon found our&s;elves di&s;appointed, and for that rea&s;on I called the head land CAPE FLATTERY. It lies in latitude 14&deg; 56&prime; S. longitude 214&deg; 43&prime; W. and is a lofty promontory, making next the &s;ea into two hills, which have a third behind them, with low &s;andy ground on each &s;ide: it may however be &s;till better known by the three i&s;lands out at &s;ea: the northermo&s;t and large&s;t lies about five leagues from the cape, in the direc|tion of N. N. E. From Cape Flattery the land trends away N. W. and N. W. by W. We &s;teered along the &s;hore N. W.
<PB N="119" REF="013324_0408_0F90F22D78322F48">
by W. till one o'clock, for what we thought the open channel, when the petty officer at the ma&s;t-head cried out that he &s;aw land ahead, extending quite round to the i&s;lands that lay without us, and a large reef between us and them: upon this I ran up to the ma&s;t head my&s;elf, from whence I very plainly &s;aw the reef, which was now &s;o far to windward, that we could not weather it, but the land ahead, which he had &s;uppo&s;ed to be the main, appeared to me to be only a clu&s;ter of &s;mall i&s;lands. As &s;oon as I got down from the ma&s;t-head, the ma&s;|ter, and &s;ome others went up, who all in&s;i&s;ted that the land ahead was not i&s;lands, but the main, and to make their report &s;till more alarming, they &s;aid that they &s;aw breakers all round us. In this dilemma, we hauled upon a wind in for the land, and made the &s;ignal for the boat, that was &s;ounding ahead, to come on board, but as &s;he was far to leward, we were obliged to edge away to take her up, and &s;oon after we came to an an|chor, under a point of the main, in &s;omewhat le&s;s than five fathom, and about the di&s;tance of a mile from the &s;hore. Cape Flattery now bore S. E. di&s;tant three leagues and an half. As &s;oon as the &s;hip was at anchor, I went a&s;hore upon the point, which is high, and afforded me a good view of the &s;ea coa&s;t, trending away N. W. by W. eight or ten leagues, which, the weather not being very clear, was as far as I could &s;ee. Nine or ten &s;mall low i&s;lands, and &s;ome &s;hoals, appeared off the coa&s;t; I &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome large &s;hoals between the main and the three high i&s;lands, without which, I was clearly of opinion there were more i&s;lands, and not any part of the main. Ex|cept the point I was now upon, which I called POINT LOOK|OUT, and Cape Flattery, the main land, to the northward of Cape Bedford, is low, and chequered with white &s;and and green bu&s;hes, for ten or twelve miles inland, beyond which it ri&s;es to a con&s;iderable height. To the northward of Point Look-out, the coa&s;t appeared to be &s;hoal and flat, for a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance, which did not encourage the hope that the channel we had hitherto found in with the land would con|tinue. Upon this point, which was narrow, and con&s;i&s;ted of the fine&s;t white &s;and we had ever &s;een, we di&s;covered the foot|&s;teps of people, and we &s;aw al&s;o &s;moke and fire at a di&s;tance up the country.</P>
<P>In the evening I returned to the &s;hip, and re&s;olved the next morning to vi&s;it one of the high i&s;lands in the offing, from the top of which, as they lay five leagues out to &s;ea, I hoped to di&s;cover more di&s;tinctly the &s;ituation of the &s;hoals, and the channel between them.</P>
<P>In the morning therefore, of the 11th, I &s;et out in the pin|nace, accompanied by Mr. Banks who&s;e fortitude and curio|&s;ity made him a party in every expedition, for the northermo&s;t and large&s;t of the three i&s;lands, and at the &s;ame time I &s;ent the
<PB N="120" REF="013324_0409_0F90EC97F1D606B0">
ma&s;ter in the yawl to leeward, to &s;ound between the low i&s;lands and the main. In my way, I pa&s;&s;ed over a reef of coral rock and &s;and, which lies about two leagues from the i&s;land, and I left another to leeward, which lies about three miles from it: on the north part of the reef, to the leeward, there is a low &s;andy i&s;land, with trees upon it; and upon the reef which we pa&s;&s;ed over, we &s;aw &s;everal turtle: we cha&s;ed one or two, but having little time to &s;pare, and the wind blowing fre&s;h, we did not take any.</P>
<P>About one o'clock we reached the i&s;land, and immediately a&s;cended the highe&s;t hill, with a mixture of hope and fear, proportioned to the importance of our bu&s;ine&s;s, and the uncer|tainty of the event: when I looked round, I di&s;covered a reef of rocks, lying between two and three leagues without the i&s;lands, and extending in a line N. W. and S. E. farther than I could &s;ee, upon which the &s;ea broke in a dreadful furl; this however made me think that there were no &s;hoals beyond them, and I conceived hopes of getting without the&s;e, as I perceived &s;everal breaks, or openings, in the reef, and deep water be|tween that and the i&s;lands. I continued upon this hill till &s;un &s;et, but the weather was &s;o hazy during the whole time that I came down much di&s;appointed. After reflecting upon what I had &s;een, and comparing the intelligence I had gained with what I expected, I determined to &s;tay upon the i&s;land all night, hoping that the morning might be clearer, and afford me a more di&s;tinct and comprehen&s;ive view. We therefore took up our lodging under the &s;helter of a bu&s;h, which grew upon the beach, and at three in the morning, having &s;ent the pinnace with one of the mates, whom I had brought out with me, to &s;ound between the i&s;lands and the reefs, and examine what appeared to be a channel through them, I climbed the hill a &s;econd time; but to my great di&s;appointment found the weather much more hazy than it had been the day before. About noon the pinnace returned, having been as far as the reef, and found between fifteen and twenty-eight fathom of water; but it blew &s;o hard that the mate did not dare to ven|ture into one of the channels, which he &s;aid appeared to him to be very narrow: this however did not di&s;courage me, for I judged from his de&s;cription of the place he had been at, that he had &s;een it to di&s;advantage. While I was bu&s;y in my &s;ur|vey, Mr. Banks was attentive to his favourite pur&s;uit, and picked up &s;everal plants which he had not before &s;een. We found the i&s;land, which is vi&s;ible at twelve leagues di&s;tance, to be about eight leagues in circumference, and in general very rocky and barren. On the north we&s;t &s;ide, however, there are &s;ome &s;andy bays, and &s;ome low land, which is covered with long thin gra&s;s, and trees of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e upon the main: this part al&s;o abounded with lizards of a very large
<PB N="121" REF="013324_0410_0F90F22E3410C410">
&s;ize, &s;ome of which we took. We found al&s;o fre&s;h water in two places; one was a running &s;tream, but that was a little bracki&s;h where I ta&s;ted it, which was clo&s;e to the &s;ea; the other was a &s;tanding pool, clo&s;e behind the &s;andy beach, and this was perfectly &s;weet and good. Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;|tance of this i&s;land from the main, we &s;aw, to our great &s;ur|prize, that it was &s;ometimes vi&s;ited by the natives; for we found &s;even or eight frames of their huts, and va&s;t heaps of &s;hells, the fi&s;h of which we &s;uppo&s;ed had been their food. We ob&s;erved that all the&s;e huts were built upon eminences, and entirely expo&s;ed to the S. E. contrary to tho&s;e which we had &s;een upon the main; for they were all built either upon the &s;ide of a hill, or under &s;ome bu&s;hes which afforded them &s;helter from the wind. From the&s;e huts, and their &s;ituation, we con|cluded that at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of the year the weather here is in|variably calm and fine; for the inhabitants have no boat which can navigate the &s;ea to &s;o great a di&s;tance, in &s;uch wea|ther as we had from the time of our fir&s;t coming upon the coa&s;t. As we &s;aw no animals upon this place but lizards, I called it LIZARD ISLAND; the other two high i&s;lands, which lie at the di&s;tance of four or 5 miles from it, are comparatively &s;mall; and near them lie three others &s;maller &s;till, and low, with &s;everal &s;hoals or reefs, e&s;pecially to the S. E.: there is however a clear pa&s;&s;age from Cape Flattery to the&s;e i&s;lands, and even quite to the outward reefs, leaving Lizard i&s;land to the north we&s;t, and the others to the &s;outh ea&s;t.</P>
<P>At two in the afternoon, there being no hope of clear wea|ther, we &s;et out from Lizard I&s;land to return to the &s;hip, and in our way landed upon the low &s;andy i&s;land with trees upon it, which we had remarked in our going out. Upon this i&s;land we &s;aw an incredible number of birds, chiefly &s;ea-fowl: we found al&s;o the ne&s;t of an eagle with young ones, which we kil|led; and the ne&s;t of &s;ome other bird, we knew not what, of a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize; it was built with &s;ticks upon the ground, and was no le&s;s than &s;ix and twenty feet in circumference, and two feet eight inches high. We found al&s;o that this place had been vi&s;ited by the Indians, probably to eat turtle, many of which we &s;aw upon the i&s;land, and a great number of their &s;hells, piled one upon another in different places.</P>
<P>To this &s;pot we gave the name of EAGLE ISLAND, and af|ter leaving it, we &s;teered S. W. directly for the &s;hip, &s;ound|ing all the way, and we had never le&s;s than eight fathom, nor more than fourteen; the &s;ame depth of water that I had found between this and Lizard I&s;land.</P>
<P>When I got on board, the ma&s;ter informed me that he had been down to the low i&s;lands, between which and the main I had directed him to &s;ound; that he judged them to lie about three leagues from the main; that without them he found from
<PB N="122" REF="013324_0411_0F90F22F05BD8F08">
ten to fourteen fathom, and between them and the main &s;even: but that a flat, which ran two leagues out from the main, made this channel narrow. Upon one of the&s;e low i&s;lands he &s;lept, and was a&s;hore upon others; and he reported, that he &s;aw every where piles of turtle-&s;hells, and fins hanging upon the trees in many places, with the fle&s;h upon them, &s;o recent, that the boat's crew eat of them: he &s;aw al&s;o two &s;pots, clear of gra&s;s, which appeared to have been lately dug up, and from the &s;hape and &s;ize of them he conjectured they were graves.</P>
<P>After con&s;idering what I had &s;een my&s;elf, and the report of the Ma&s;ter, I was of opinion that the pa&s;&s;age to leeward would be dangerous, and that, by keeping in with the main, we &s;hould run the ri&s;k of being locked in by the great reef, and at la&s;t be compelled to return back in &s;earch of another pa&s;|&s;age, by which, or any other accident that &s;hould cau&s;e the &s;ame delay, we &s;hould infallible lo&s;e our pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and endanger the ruin of the voyage, as we had now but little more than three months provi&s;ions on board at &s;hort allowance.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated this opinion, and the facts and appearances upon which it was founded, to the officers, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that the be&s;t thing we could do would be to quit the coa&s;t altogether, till we could approach it with le&s;s danger.</P>
<P>In the morning therefore, at break of day, we got under &s;ail, and &s;tood out N. E. for the north we&s;t end of Lizard I&s;land, leaving Eagle I&s;land to windward, and &s;ome other i&s;lands and &s;hoals to the leeward, and having the pinnace ahead to a&s;certain the depth of water in every part of our cour&s;e. In this channel we had from nine to fourteen fathom. At noon, the north we&s;t end of Lizard I&s;land bore E. S. E. di&s;tant one mile; our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 14&deg; 38&prime;, and our depth of water fourteen fathom. We had a &s;teady gale at S. E. and by two o'clock we ju&s;t fetched to windward of one of the channels or openings in the outer reef, which I had &s;een from the i&s;land. We now tacked, and made a &s;hort trip to the S. W. while the ma&s;ter in the pinnace examined the chan|nel: he &s;oon made the &s;ignal for the &s;hip to follow, and in a &s;hort time &s;he got &s;afe out. As &s;oon as we had got without the breakers, we had no ground with one hundred and fifty fathom, and found a large &s;ea rolling in from the S. E. a certain &s;ign that neither land nor &s;hoals were near us in that direction.</P>
<P>Our cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> of &s;ituation was now vi&s;ible in every counte|nance, for it was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt in every brea&s;t: we had been little le&s;s than three months entangled among &s;hoals and rocks, that every moment threatened us with de&s;truction; frequently pa&s;&s;ing our nights at anchor within hearing of the &s;urge that broke over them; &s;ometimes driving towards them even while our anchors were out, and knowing that if by any

accident, to which an almo&s;t continual tempe&s;t expo&s;ed us, they &s;hould not hold, we mu&s;t in a few minutes inevitably pe|ri&s;h. But now, after having &s;ailed no le&s;s than three hundred and &s;ixty leagues, without once having a man out of the chains, heaving the lead, even for a Minute, which perhaps never happened to any other ve&s;&s;el, we found our&s;elves in an open &s;ea, with deep water; and enjoyed a flow of &s;pirits which was equally owing to our late dangers, and our pre&s;ent &s;ecurity: yet the very waves, which by their &s;well convinced us that we had no rocks or &s;hoals to fear, convinced us al&s;o that we could not &s;afely put the &s;ame confidence in our ve&s;&s;el as before &s;he had &s;truck; for the blows &s;he received from them &s;o widened her leaks, that &s;he admitted no le&s;s than nine inches water in an hour, which, con&s;idering the &s;tate of our pumps, and the navigation that was &s;till before us, would have been a &s;ubject of more &s;erious con&s;ideration, to people who&s;e danger had not &s;o lately been &s;o much more imminent.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age or channel, through which we pa&s;&s;ed into the open &s;ea beyond the reef, lies in latitude 14&deg; 32&prime; S. and may always be known by the three high i&s;lands within it, which I have called the ISLANDS OF DIRECTION, becau&s;e by the&s;e a &s;tranger may find a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age though the reef quite to the main. The channel lies from Lizard I&s;land N. E. &frac12; N. di&s;|tant three leagues, and is about one third of a mile broad, and not more in length. Lizard I&s;land which is, as I have before ob&s;erved, the large&s;t and the northermo&s;t of the three, affords &s;afe anchorage under the north we&s;t &s;ide, fre&s;h water, and wood for fuel. The low i&s;lands and &s;hoals al&s;o which lie between it and the main abound with turtle and fi&s;h, which may probably be caught in all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, except when the weather is very tempe&s;tuous; &s;o that, all things con&s;idered, there is not perhaps a better place for &s;hips to refre&s;h at upon the whole coa&s;t than this i&s;land. And before I di&s;mi&s;s it, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that we found upon it, as well as upon the beach, in and about Endeavour River, bamboos, cocoa nuts, pumice &s;tone, and the &s;eeds of plants which are not the produce of this country, and which it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e are brought from the ea&s;tward by the trade winds. The i&s;lands which were di&s;covered by Quiros, and called Au&s;tralia del E&s;piritu Santa, lie in this parallel; but how far to the ea&s;tward cannot now be a&s;certained: in mo&s;t charts they are placed in the &s;ame longitude with this country, which, as appears by the account of his voyage that has been publi&s;hed, he never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; for that places his di&s;coveries no le&s;s than two and twenty degrees to the ea&s;tward of it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were without the reef, we brought to, and having hoi&s;ted in the boats, we &s;tood off and on upon a wind

all night; for I was not willing to run to leeward till I had a whole day before me. In the morning, at day-break, Lizard I&s;land bore S. 15 E. di&s;tant ten leagues; and we then made &s;ail and &s;tood away N. N. W. &frac12; W. till 9 o'clock, when we &s;tood N. W. &frac12; N. having the advantage of a fre&s;h gale at S. E. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 13&deg; 46&prime; S. and at this time we had no land in &s;ight. At &s;ix in the evening we &s;hortened &s;ail and brought the &s;hip to, with her head to the N. E.; and at &s;ix in the morning made &s;ail and &s;teered we&s;t, in order to get within &s;ight of the land, that I might be &s;ure not to over&s;hoot the pa&s;&s;age, if a pa&s;&s;age there was, between this land and New Guinea. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;er|vation was 13&deg; 2&prime; S., longitude 216&deg; W.; which was 1&deg; 23&prime; W. of Lizard I&s;land: at this time we had no land in &s;ight; but a little before one o'clock, we &s;aw high land from the ma&s;t head, bearing W. S. W. At two we &s;aw no more land to the N. W. of that we had &s;een before: it appeared in hills, like i&s;lands; but we judged it to be a continuation of the main land. About three we di&s;covered breakers between the land and the &s;hip, extending to the &s;outhward farther than we could &s;ee; but to the north we thought we &s;aw them terminate abrea&s;t of us. What we took for the end of them in this di|rection, however, &s;oon appeared to be only an opening in the reef; for we pre&s;ently &s;aw them again, extending northward beyond the reach of our &s;ight. Upon this we hauled clo&s;e upon a wind, which was now at E. S. E. and we had &s;carcely trim|med our &s;ails before it came to E. by N. which was right upon the reef, and con&s;equently made our clearing it doubtful. At &s;un&s;et the northermo&s;t part of it that was in &s;ight bore from us N. by E. and was two or three leagues di&s;tant; this however being the be&s;t tack to clear it, we kept &s;tanding to the north|ward with all the &s;ail we could &s;et till midnight; when, being afraid of &s;tanding too far in this direction, we tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outhward, our run from &s;un&s;et to this time being &s;ix leagues N. and N. by E. When we had &s;tood about two miles S. S. E. it fell calm; we had &s;ounded &s;everal times during the night, but had no bottom with one hundred and forty fathom, neither had we any ground now with the &s;ame length of line; yet, about four in the morning, we plainly heard the roaring of the &s;urf, and at break of day &s;aw it foaming to a va&s;t height, at not more than a mile's di&s;tance. Our di&s;tre&s;s now re|turned upon us with double force; the waves which rolled in upon the reef, carried us towards it very fa&s;t; we could reach no ground with an anchor, and had not a breath of wind for the &s;ail. In this dreadful &s;ituation, no re&s;ource was left us but the boats; and to aggravate our misfortune the pinnace was under repair: the long boat and yawl however were put into the water, and &s;ent ahead to tow, which, by the help of
<PB N="125" REF="013324_0414_0F90F231EF6F6AD8">
our &s;weeps abaft, got the &s;hip's head round to the northward; which, if it could not prevent our de&s;truction, might at lea&s;t delay it. But it was &s;ix o'clock before this was effected, and we were not then a hundred yards from the rock upon which the &s;ame billow which wa&s;hed the &s;ide of the &s;hip, broke to a tremendous height the very next time it ro&s;e; &s;o that between us and de&s;truction there was only a dreary valley, no wider than the ba&s;e of one wave, and even now the &s;ea under us was unfathomable, at lea&s;t no bottom was to be found with an hundred and twenty fathom. During this &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s the carpenter had found means to patch up the pinnace; &s;o that &s;he was hoi&s;ted out, and &s;ent ahead, in aid of the other boats, to tow; but all our efforts would have been ineffectual, if, ju&s;t at this cri&s;is of our fate, a light air of wind had not &s;prung up, &s;o light, that at any other time we &s;hould not have ob|&s;erved it, but which was enough to turn the &s;cale in our fa|vour, and, in conjunction with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which was affor|ded us by the boats, to give the &s;hip a perceptible motion ob|liquely from the reef. Our hopes now revived; but in le&s;s than ten minutes it was again a dead calm, and the &s;hip was again driven towards the breakers, which were not now two hundred yards di&s;tance. The &s;ame light breeze however re|turned before we had lo&s;t all the ground it had enabled us to gain, and la&s;ted about ten minutes more. During this time we di&s;covered a &s;mall opening in the reef, at about the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile: I immediately &s;ent one of the mates to examine it, who reported that its breadth was not more than the length of the &s;hip, but that within it there was &s;mooth water: this di&s;covery &s;eemed to render our e&s;cape po&s;|&s;ible, and that was all, by pu&s;hing the &s;hip through the open|ing, which was immediately attempted. It was uncertain in|deed whether we could reach it; but if we &s;hould &s;ucceed thus far, we made no doubt of being able to get through: in this however we were di&s;appointed, for having reached it by the joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our boats and the breeze, we found that in the mean time it had become high water, and to our great &s;urprize we met the tide of ebb ru&s;hing out of it like a mill|&s;tream. We gained however &s;ome advantage, though in a manner directly contrary to our expectations; we found it im|po&s;&s;ible to go through the opening, but the &s;tream that pre|vented us, carried us about a quarter of a mile: it was too narrow for us to keep in it longer; yet this tide of ebb &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;ted the boats that by noon we got an offing of near two miles. We had, however, rea&s;on to de&s;pair of delive|rance, even if the breeze, which had now died away, &s;hould revive, for we were &s;till embayed in the reef; and the tide of ebb being &s;pent, the tide of flood, notwith&s;tanding our utmo&s;t efforts, again drove the &s;hip into the bite. About this time,
<PB N="126" REF="013324_0415_0F8FFB69138B95F8">
however, we &s;aw another opening, near a mile to the we&s;t ward, which I immediately &s;ent the fir&s;t Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, in the &s;mall boat to examine: in the mean time we &s;truggled hard with the flood, &s;ometimes gaining a little, and &s;ometimes lo&s;ing; but every man &s;till did his duty, with as much calmne&s;s and regularity as if no danger had been near. About two o'clock Mr. Hicks returned with an account that the opening was narrow and dangerous, but that it might be pa&s;&s;ed: the po&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing it was &s;ufficient encourage|ment to make the attempt, for all danger was le&s;s imminent than that of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. A light breeze now &s;prung up at E. N. E. with which, by the help of our boats, and the very tide of flood that without an opening would have been our de&s;truction, we entered it, and were hurried through with amazing rapidity, by a torrent that kept us from driving again&s;t either &s;ide of the channel, which was not more than a quarter of a mile in breadth. While we were &s;hooting this gulph, our &s;oundings were from thirty to &s;even fathom, very irregular, and the ground at bottom very foul.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had got within the reef we anchored in nine|teen fathom, over a bottom of coral and &s;hells. And now, &s;uch is the vici&s;&s;itude of life, we thought our&s;elves happy in having regained a &s;ituation, which but two days before it was the utmo&s;t object of our hope to quit. Rocks and &s;hoals are always dangerous to the mariner, even where their &s;ituation has been a&s;certained; they are more dangerous in &s;eas which have never before been navigated, and in this part of the globe they are more dangerous than in any other; for here they are reefs of coral rock, ri&s;ing like a wall almo&s;t perpendicularly out of the unfathomable deep, always overflowed at high wa|ter, and at low water dry in many places; and here the enor|mous waves of the va&s;t Southern Ocean, meeting with &s;o ab|rupt a re&s;i&s;tance, break with inconceivable violence, in a &s;urf which no rocks or &s;torms in the northern hemi&s;phere can pro|duce. The danger of navigating unknown parts of this ocean was now greatly increa&s;ed by our having a crazy &s;hip, and being &s;hort of previ&s;ions and every other nece&s;&s;ary; yet the di&s;tinction of a fir&s;t di&s;coverer made us cheerfully encounter every danger, and &s;ubmit to every inconvenience; and we cho&s;e rather to incur the cen&s;ure of imprudence and temerity, which the idle and voluptuous &s;o liberally be&s;tow upon un|&s;ucce&s;sful fortitude and per&s;everance, that leave a country which we had di&s;covered unexplored, and give colour to a charge of timidity and irre&s;olution.</P>
<P>Having now congratulated our&s;elves upon getting within the reef, notwith&s;tanding we had &s;o lately congratulated our|&s;elves upon getting without it, I re&s;olved to keep the main land on board in my future route to the northward, whatever
<PB N="127" REF="013324_0416_0F8FFB6AAAFB5390">
the con&s;equence might be; for if we had now gone without the reef again, it might have carried us &s;o far from the coa&s;t, as to prevent my being able to determine, whether this coun|try did, or did not, join to New-Guinea; a que&s;tion which I was determined to re&s;olve from my fir&s;t coming within &s;ight of land. However, as I had experienced the di&s;advantage of having a boat under repair, at a time when it was po&s;&s;ible I might want to u&s;e her, I determined to remain fa&s;t at anchor, till the pinnace was perfectly refitted. As I had no employ|ment for the other boats, I &s;ent them out in the morning to the reef, to &s;ee what refre&s;hments could be procured, and Mr. Banks in his little boat, accompanied by Dr. Solander, went with them. In this &s;ituation I &s;ound the variation by ampli|tude and azimuth to be 4&deg; 9&prime; E.; and at noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 12&deg; 38&prime; S. and our longitude 216&deg; 45&prime; W. The main land extended from N. 66 W. to S. W. by S. and the neare&s;t part of it was di&s;tant about 9 leagues. The open|ing through which we had pa&s;&s;ed, I called PROVIDENTIAL CHANNEL; and this bore E. N. E. di&s;tant ten or twelve miles: on the main land within us was a lofty promontory, which I called CAPE WEYMOUTH; on the north &s;ide of which is a bay, which I called WEYMOUTH BAY: they lie in latitude 12&deg; 42&prime; S., longitude 127&deg; 15&prime; W. At four o'clock in the afternoon the boats returned with two hundred and forty pound of the meat of &s;hell fi&s;h, chiefly of cockles, &s;ome of which were as much as two men could move, and contained twenty pounds of good meat. Mr. Banks al&s;o brought back many curious &s;hells, and <HI>Mollu&s;ca;</HI> be&s;ides many &s;pecies of coral, among which was that called the <HI>Tubipora Mu&s;ica.</HI></P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning we got under fail and &s;tood away to the N. W. having two boats ahead to direct us; our &s;oundings were very irregular, varying five or &s;ix fathom every ca&s;t, between ten and twenty-&s;even. A little before noon, we pa&s;&s;ed a low &s;andy i&s;land, which we left on our &s;tarboard &s;ide, at the di&s;tance of two miles. At noon our latitude was 12&deg; 28&prime;, and our di&s;tance from the main about four leagues: it extended from S. by W. to N. 71 W. and &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands from N. 40 W. to 54 W. Between us and the main were &s;e|veral &s;hoals, and &s;ome without us, be&s;ides the main or outer|mo&s;t reef, which we could &s;ee from the ma&s;t-head, &s;tretching away to the N. E. At two in the afternoon, as we were &s;teer|ing N. W. by N. we &s;aw a large &s;hoal right ahead, extend|ing three or four points upon each bow; upon this we hauled up N. N. E. and N. E. by N. to get round the north point of it, which we reached by four, and then edged away to the we&s;tward, and ran between the north end of this &s;hoal and another, which lies two miles to the northward of it, having a boat all the way ahead &s;ounding; our depth of water was &s;till
<PB N="128" REF="013324_0417_0F90F23214265340">
very irregular, from twenty-two to eight fathom. At half an hour after &s;ix, we anchored in thirteen fathom: the norther|mo&s;t of the &s;mall i&s;lands &s;een at noon bore W. &frac12; S. di&s;tant three miles: the&s;e i&s;lands are di&s;tingui&s;hed in the chart by the name of FORBES'S ISLANDS, and lie about five leagues from the main, which here forms a high point that we called BOLT HEAD, from which the land trends more we&s;terly, and is in that direction all low and &s;andy; to the &s;outhward it is high and hilly, even near the &s;ea.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning we got again under &s;ail, and &s;teered for an i&s;land which lay at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the main, and at this time bore from us N. 40 W. di&s;tant about five leagues: our cour&s;e was &s;oon interrupted by &s;hoals; however, by the help of the boats, and a good look-out from the top of the ma&s;t, we got into a fair channel that led us down to the i&s;land, between a very large &s;hoal on our &s;tarboard &s;ide, and &s;everal &s;mall ones towards the main: in this channel we had from twenty to thirty fathom water. Between eleven and twelve o'clock we hauled round the north ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, leav|ing it between us and the main, from which it is di&s;tant about &s;even or eight miles. This i&s;land is about a league in circuit, and we &s;aw upon it five of the natives, two of whom had lances in their hands; they came down upon a point, and hav|ing looked a little while at the &s;hip, retired. To the N. W. of it are &s;everal low i&s;lands and quays, which lie not far from the main; and to the northward and ea&s;tward are &s;everal other i&s;lands and &s;hoals; &s;o that we were now encompa&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide; but having lately been expo&s;ed to much greater danger, and rocks and &s;hoals being grown familiar, we looked at them comparatively with little concern. The main land appeared to be low and barren, inter&s;per&s;ed with large patches of very fine white &s;and, which we had found upon Lizard I&s;land and dif|ferent parts of the main. The boats had &s;een many turtle upon the &s;hoals which they pa&s;&s;ed, but it blew too hard for them to take any. At noon our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 12&deg;, and our longitude 217&deg; 25&prime;: our depth of water was four|teen fathom; and our cour&s;e and di&s;tance, reduced to a &s;trait line, was, between this time and the preceeding noon N. 29 W. thirty-two miles.</P>
<P>The main land within the i&s;lands that have been ju&s;t men|tioned forms a point, which I dalled CAPE GRENVILLE: it lies in latitude 11&deg; 58&prime;, longitude 217&deg; 38&prime;; and between it and Bolt Head is a bay, which I called TEMPLE BAY. At the di&s;tance of nine leagues from Cape Grenville, in the di|rection of E. &frac12; N. lie &s;ome high i&s;lands, which I called SIR CHARLES HARDY'S ISLES; and tho&s;e which lie off the Cape I called COCKBURN'S ISLES. Having lain by for the boats, which had got out of their &s;tation, till about one o'clock,
<PB N="129" REF="013324_0418_0F8FFB6BD100AD28">
we then took the yawl in tow; and the pinnace having got ahead, we filled, and &s;tood N. by W. for &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands which lay in that direction; &s;uch at lea&s;t they were in ap|pearance, but upon approaching them we perceived that they were joined together by a large reef: upon this we edged away N. W. and left them on our &s;tarboard hand; we &s;teered between them and the i&s;lands that lay off the main, having a clear pa&s;&s;age, and from fifteen to twenty-three fathom water. At four o'clock, we di&s;covered &s;ome low i&s;lands and rocks, bearing W. N. W. and &s;tood directly for them: at half an hour after &s;ix, we anchored on the north ea&s;t &s;ide of the nor|thermo&s;t of them, at one mile di&s;tance, and in &s;ixteen fathom. The&s;e i&s;lands lie N. W. four leagues from Cape Grenville, and from the number of birds that I &s;aw upon them, I called them BIRD ISLES. A little before &s;un-&s;et, we were in &s;ight of the main land, which appeared all very low and &s;andy, extending as far to the northward as N. W. by N. &s;ome &s;hoals, quays, and low &s;andy i&s;les &s;tretching away to the N. E.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we got again under &s;ail, with a fre&s;h breeze at E. and &s;tood away N. N. W: for &s;ome low i&s;lands in that direction, but were &s;oon obliged to haul clo&s;e upon a wind, to weather a &s;hoal which we di&s;covered upon our larboard bow, having at the &s;ame time others to the ea&s;t|ward: by the time we had weathered this &s;hoal to leeward, we had brought the i&s;lands well upon our lee bow, but &s;eeing &s;ome &s;hoals running off from them, and &s;ome rocks on our &s;tarboard bow, which we did not di&s;cover till we were very near them, I was afraid to go to windward of the i&s;lands, and therefore brought to, and having made the &s;ignal for the pinnace, which was ahead, to come on board, I &s;ent her to leeward of the i&s;lands, with orders to keep along the edge of the &s;hoal, which ran off from the &s;outh &s;ide of the &s;outhermo&s;t i&s;land, &s;ending the yawl at the &s;ame time, to run over the &s;hoal in &s;earch of turtle. As &s;oon as the pinnace had got to a proper di&s;tance, we wore, and &s;tood after her: as we ran to leeward of this i&s;land, we took the yawl in tow, &s;he having &s;een only one &s;mall turtle, and therefore made but little &s;tay upon the &s;hoal. The i&s;land we found to be a &s;mall &s;pot of &s;and, with &s;ome trees upon it, and we could di&s;cern many huts, or habi|tations of the natives, whom we &s;uppo&s;ed occa&s;ionally to vi&s;it the&s;e i&s;lands from the main, they being only five leagues di&s;|tant, to catch turtle, when they come a&s;hore to lay their eggs. We continued to &s;tand after the pinnace N. N. E. and N. by E. for two other low i&s;lands, having two &s;hoals with|out us, and one between us and the main. At noon, we were about four leagues from the main, which we &s;aw extending to the northward, as far as N. W. by N. all flat and &s;andy. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation, was 11&deg; 23&prime; S. and our longitude 217&deg;
<PB N="130" REF="013324_0419_0F90F232B693D510">
46&prime; W. our &s;oundings were from fourteen to twenty-three fathom; but the&s;e, as well as the &s;hoals and i&s;lands, are too numerous to be particularly mentioned. By one o'clock, we had run nearly the length of the &s;outhermo&s;t of the two i&s;lands in &s;ight, and finding that the going to windward of them would carry us too far from the main, we bore up and ran to leeward, where, finding a fair open pa&s;&s;age, we &s;teered N. by W. in a direction parallel to the main, leaving a &s;mall i&s;land which lay between it and the &s;hip, and &s;ome low &s;andy i&s;les and &s;hoals without us, of all which we lo&s;t &s;ight by four o'clock, and &s;aw no more before the &s;un went down: at this time the farthe&s;t part of the land in &s;ight bore N. N. W. &frac12; W. and &s;oon after we anchored in thirteen fathom, upon &s;oft ground, at the di&s;tance of about five leagues from the land, where we lay till day-light.</P>
<P>Early in the morning, we made &s;ail again, and &s;teered N. N. W. by compa&s;s, for the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight; and at this time we ob&s;erved the variation of the needle to be 3&deg; 6&prime; E. At 8 o'clock, we di&s;covered &s;hoals ahead, and on our larboard bow, and &s;aw that the northermo&s;t land, which we had taken for the main, was detached from it, and that we might pa&s;s between them, by running to leeward of the &s;hoals on our larboard bow, which were now near us: we therefore wore and brought to, &s;ending away the pinnace and yawl to direct us, and then &s;teered N. W. along the S. W. or in&s;ide of the &s;hoals, keeping a good look-out from the ma&s;t-head, and having another &s;hoal on our larboard &s;ide: we found however a good channel of a mile broad between them, in which we had from ten to fourteen fathom. At eleven o'clock we were nearly the length of the land detached from the main, and there appeared to be no ob&s;truction in the pa&s;&s;age between them, yet having the long boat a&s;tern and rigged, we &s;ent her away to keep in &s;hore upon our larboard bow, and at the &s;ame time di&s;patched the pinnace a-&s;tarboard; precautions which I thought nece&s;&s;ary, as we had a &s;trong flood that car|ried us an end very fa&s;t, and it was near high water: as &s;oon as the boats were ahead, we &s;tood after them, and by noon got through the pa&s;&s;age. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation, was then 10&deg; 36&prime;, and the neare&s;t part of the main, which we &s;oon after found to be the northermo&s;t, bore W. 2 S. di&s;tant between three or four miles: we found the land which was detached from the main, to be a &s;ingle i&s;land, extending from N. to N. 75 E. di&s;tant between two and three miles; at the &s;ame time we &s;aw other i&s;lands at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, ex|tending from N. by W. to W. N. W. and behind them an|other chain of high land, which we judged al&s;o to be i&s;lands: there were &s;till other i&s;lands, extending as far as N. 71 W. which at this time we took for the main.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="013324_0420_0F8FFB6C32BD6528">
The point of the main which forms the &s;ide of the channel, through which we had pa&s;&s;ed, oppo&s;ite to the i&s;land, is the northern promontory of the country, and I called it YORK CAPE. Its longitude is 218&deg; 24&prime; W. the latitude of the north point is 10&deg; 37&prime;, and of the ea&s;t point 10&deg; 42&prime; S. The land over the ea&s;t point, and to the &s;outhward of it, is rather low, and as far as the eye can reach, very flat, and of a barren ap|pearance. To the &s;outhward of the cape the &s;hore forms a large open bay, which I called NEWCASTLE BAY, and in which are &s;ome &s;mall low i&s;lands and &s;hoals; the land adja|cent is al&s;o very low, flat, and &s;andy. The land of the nor|thern part of the cape is more hilly, the vallies &s;eem to be well clothed with wood, and the &s;hore forms &s;ome &s;mall bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage. Clo&s;e to the ea&s;tern point of the cape are three &s;mall i&s;lands, from one of which a &s;mall ledge of rocks runs out into the &s;ea: there is al&s;o an i&s;land clo&s;e to the northern point. The i&s;land that forms the &s;treight or channel through which we had pa&s;&s;ed, lies about four miles without the&s;e, which, except two, are very &s;mall: the &s;outhermo&s;t is the large&s;t, and much higher than any part of the main land. On the north we&s;t &s;ide of this i&s;land there appeared to be good anchorage, and on &s;hore, val|lies that promi&s;ed both wood and water. To the &s;outhward and &s;outh ea&s;t, and even to the ea&s;tward and northward of them, there are &s;everal other low i&s;lands, rocks, and &s;hoals: our depth of water in &s;ailing between them and the main, was twelve, thirteen, and fourteen fathom.</P>
<P>We &s;tood along the &s;hore to the we&s;tward, with a gentle breeze at S. E. by S. and when we had advanced between three and four miles, we di&s;covered the land ahead, which, when we fir&s;t &s;aw it, we took for the main, to be i&s;lands detached from it by &s;everal channels: upon this we &s;ent away the boats, with proper in&s;tructions, to lead us through that channel which was next the main; but &s;oon after di&s;covering rocks and &s;hoals in this channel, I made a &s;ignal for the boats to go through the next channel to the northward, which lay between the&s;e i&s;lands, leaving &s;ome of them between us and the main: the &s;hip followed, and had never le&s;s than five fathom water in the narrowe&s;t part of the channel, where the di&s;tance from i&s;land to i&s;land was about one mile and an half.</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the afternoon we anchored, being about a mile and a half, or two miles within the entrance, in &s;ix fathom and a half, with clear ground: the channel here had begun to widen, and the i&s;lands on each &s;ide of us were di&s;|tant about a mile: the main land &s;tretched away to the S. W. the farthe&s;t point in view bore S. 48 W. and the &s;outhermo&s;t point of the i&s;lands, on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age, bore S. 76 W. Between the&s;e two points we could &s;ee no land, &s;o
<PB N="132" REF="013324_0421_0F90F2337A2AEE20">
that we conceived hopes of having, at la&s;t, found a pa&s;&s;age in|to the Indian &s;ea; however, that I might be able to determine with more certainty, I re&s;olved to land upon the i&s;land which lies at the &s;outh ea&s;t point of the pa&s;&s;age. Upon this i&s;land we had &s;een many of the inhabitants when we fir&s;t came to an anchor, and when I went into the boat, with a party of men, accompanied by Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, in order to go a&s;hore, we &s;aw ten of them upon a hill: nine of them were armed with &s;uch lances as we had been u&s;ed to &s;ee, and the tenth had a bow, and a bundle of arrows, which we had never &s;een in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the natives of this country before: we al&s;o ob&s;erved, that two of them had large ornaments of mother of pearl hanging round their necks. Three of the&s;e, one of whom was the bowman, placed them&s;elves upon the beach abrea&s;t of us, and we expected that they would have oppo&s;ed our landing, but when we came within about a mu&s;ket's &s;hot of the beach, they walked lei&s;urely away. We immediately climbed the highe&s;t hill, which was not more than three times as high as the ma&s;t-head, and the mo&s;t barren of any we had &s;een. From this hill, no land could be &s;een between the S. W. and W. S. W. &s;o that I had no doubt of finding a channel through. The land to the north we&s;t of it con&s;i&s;ted of a great number of i&s;lands of various extent, and different heights, ranged one behind another, as far to the northward and we&s;t|ward as I could &s;ee, which could not be le&s;s than thirteen leagues. As I was now about to quit the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of New-Holland, which I had coa&s;ted from latitude 38 to this place, and which I am confident no European had ever &s;een before, I once more hoi&s;ted Engli&s;h colours, and though I had already taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal particular parts, I now took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole ea&s;tern coa&s;t, from latitude 38&deg; to this place, latitude 10&frac12; S. in right of his Maje&s;ty King George the Third, by the name of NEW SOUTH WALES, with all the bays, harbours, rivers and i&s;lands &s;ituated upon it: we then fired three vollies of &s;mall arms, which were an&s;wered by the &s;ame number from the &s;hip. Having performed this cere|mony upon the i&s;land, which we called POSSESSION ISLAND, we reimbarked in our boat, but a rapid ebb-tide &s;etting N. E. made our return to the ve&s;&s;el very difficult and tedious. From the time of our la&s;t coming among the &s;hoals, we con&s;tantly found a moderate tide, the flood &s;etting to the N. W. and the ebb to the S. E. At this place, it is high water at the full and change of the moon, about one or two o'clock, and the water ri&s;es and falls perpendicularly about twelve feet. We &s;aw &s;moke ri&s;ing in many places from the adjacent lands and i&s;lands, as we had done upon every part of the coa&s;t, after our la&s;t return to it through the reef.</P>
<P>We continued at anchor all night, and between &s;even and
<PB N="133" REF="013324_0422_0F90F23435646560">
eight o'clock in the morning, we &s;aw three or four of the natives upon the beach gathering &s;hell-fi&s;h; we di&s;covered, by the help of our gla&s;&s;es, that they were women, and, like all the other inhabitants of this country, &s;tark naked. At low water, which happened about ten o'clock, we got under &s;ail, and &s;tood to the S. W. with a light breeze at E. which afterwards veered to N. by E.: our depth of water was from &s;ix to ten fathom, except in one place where we had but five. At noon, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion i&s;land bore N. 53 E. di&s;tant four leagues, the we&s;tern extremity of the main land in &s;ight bore S. 43 W. di&s;tant between four and five leagues, and appeared to be ex|tremely low, the &s;outh we&s;t point of the large&s;t i&s;land on the northwe&s;t &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age bore N. 71 W. di&s;tant eight miles, and this point I called CAPE CORNWALL. It lies in latitude 10&deg; 43&prime; S., longitude 219&deg; W.; and &s;ome low lands that lie about the middle of the pa&s;&s;age, which I called WALLIS'S ISLES, bore W. by S. &frac12; S. di&s;tant about two leages: our la|titude by ob&s;ervation, was 10&deg; 46&prime; S. We continued to ad|vance with the tide of flood W. N. W. having little wind, and from eight to five fathom water. At half an hour after one, the pinnace, which was ahead, made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water, upon which we tacked, and &s;ent away the yawl to &s;ound al&s;o: we then tacked again, and &s;tood after them: in about two hours, they both made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water, and the tide being nearly at its greate&s;t height, I was afraid to &s;tand on, as running aground at that time might be fatal: I therefore came to an anchor in &s;omewhat le&s;s that &s;even fa|thom, &s;andy ground. Wallis's i&s;land bore S. by W. &frac12; W. di&s;tant five or &s;ix miles, the i&s;lands to the northward extended from S. 73 E. to N. 10 E. and a &s;mall i&s;land, which was ju&s;t in &s;ight bore N. W. &frac12; W. Here we found the flood tide &s;et to the we&s;tward, and the ebb to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>After we had come to an anchor, I &s;ent away the ma&s;ter in the long-boat, to &s;ound, who, upon his return in the evening, reported, that there was a bank &s;tretching north and &s;outh, upon which there were but three fathom, and that beyond it there were &s;even. About this time it fell calm, and continued &s;o till nine the next morning, when we weighed, with a light breeze at S. S. E. and &s;teered N. W. by W. for the &s;mall i&s;land which was ju&s;t in &s;ight, having fir&s;t &s;ent the boats ahead to &s;ound: the depth of water was eight, &s;even, &s;ix, five, and four fathom, and three fatham upon the bank, it being now the la&s;t quarter ebb. At this time, the northermo&s;t i&s;land in &s;ight bore N. 9 E. Cape Cornwall E. di&s;tant three leagues. This bank, at lea&s;t &s;o much as we have &s;ounded, extends nearly N. and S. but to what di&s;tance I do not know: Its breadth is not more than half a mile at the utmo&s;t. When we had got over the bank, we deepened our water to &s;ix fathom
<PB N="134" REF="013324_0423_0F8FFB7059C28738">
quarters, and had the &s;ame depth all the way to the &s;mall i&s;land ahead, which we reached by noon, when it bore S. di&s;tant about half a mile. Our depth of water was now five fathom, and the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight, which is part of the &s;ame chain of i&s;lands that we had &s;een to the northward from the time of our fir&s;t entering the &s;treight, bore N. 71 E. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation, was 10&deg; 33&prime; S. and our longitude 219&deg; 22&prime; W.: in this &s;ituation, no part of the main was in fight. As we were now near the i&s;land, and had but little wind, Mr. Banks and I landed upon it, and found it, except a few patches of wood, to be a barren rock, the haunt of birds, which had frequented it in &s;uch numbers, as to make the &s;ur|face almo&s;t uniformly white with their dung: of the&s;e birds, the greater part &s;eemed to be boobies, and I therefore called the place BOOBY ISLAND. After a &s;hort &s;tay, we returned to the &s;hip, and in the mean time the wind had got to the S. W.; it was but a gentle breeze, yet it was accompanied by a &s;well from the &s;ame quarter, which, with other circum&s;tances, confirmed my opinion, that we were got to the we&s;tward of Carpentaria, or the northern extremity of New-Holland, and had now an open &s;ea to the we&s;tward, which gave me great &s;atisfaction, not only becau&s;e the dangers and fatigues of the voyage were drawing to an end, but becau&s;e it would no lon|ger be a doubt whether New Holland and New Guinea were two &s;eparate i&s;lands, or different parts of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The north ea&s;t entrance of this pa&s;&s;age, or &s;treight, lies in the latitude of 10&deg; 39&prime; S. and in the longitude of 218&deg; 36&prime; W. It is formed by the main, or the northern extremity of New-Holland, on the S. E. and by a congeries of i&s;lands, which I called the PRINCE OF WALES'S ISLANDS, to the N. W. and it is probable that the&s;e i&s;lands extend quite to New Guinea. They differ very much both in height and circuit, and many of them &s;eemed to be well clothed with herbage and wood: Upon mo&s;t, if not all of them, we &s;aw &s;moke, and therefore there can be no doubt of their being inhabited: it is al&s;o probable, that among them there are at lea&s;t as good pa&s;&s;ages as that we came through, perhaps better, though better would not need to be de&s;ired, if the acce&s;s to it from the ea&s;tward, were le&s;s dangerous: that a le&s;s dangerous acce&s;s may be di&s;covered, I think there is little rea&s;on to doubt, and to find it little more &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary, than to determine how far the principal, or outer reef, which bounds the &s;hoals to the ea&s;t|ward, extends towards the north, which I would not have left to future navigators if I had been le&s;s hara&s;&s;ed by danger and fatigue, and had had a &s;hip in better condition for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To this channel, or pa&s;&s;age, I have given the name of the &s;hip, and called it ENDEAVOUR STREIGHTS. Its length
<PB N="135" REF="013324_0424_0F90F2350CCE1768">
from N. E. to S. W. is ten leagues, and is about five leagues broad, except at the north ea&s;t entrance, where it is &s;ome|what le&s;s than two miles, being contracted by the i&s;lands which lie there. That which I called Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion i&s;land is of a moderate height and circuit, and this we left between us and the main, pa&s;&s;ing between it and two &s;mall round i&s;lands, which lie about two miles to the N. W. of it. The two &s;mall i&s;lands, which I called Wallis's i&s;lands, lie in the middle of the &s;outh we&s;t entrance, and the&s;e we left to the &s;outhward. Our depth of water in the &s;treight, was from four to nine fa|thom, with every where good anchorage, except upon the bank, which lies two leagues to the northward of Wallis's I&s;lands, where, at low water, there are but three fathom: for a more particular knowledge of this &s;treight, and of the &s;itua|tions of the &s;everal i&s;lands and &s;hoals on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of New Wales, I refer to the chart; yet with re&s;pect to the &s;hoals, I cannot pretend that one half of them are laid down, nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible that one half of them &s;hould be di&s;covered in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle na- vigation: many i&s;lands al&s;o mu&s;t have e&s;caped my pencil, e&s;pecially between latitude 20&deg; and 22&deg;, where we &s;aw i&s;lands out at &s;ea as far as an i&s;land could be di&s;tingui&s;hed; it mu&s;t not therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed, by future navigators, that where no &s;hoal or i&s;land is laid down in my chart, no &s;hoal nor i&s;land will be found in the&s;e &s;eas: it is enough that the &s;ituation of tho&s;e that appear in the chart is faithfully a&s;certained, and, in general, I have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to hope that it will be found as free from error as any that has not been corrected by &s;ub&s;equent and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ob&s;ervations. The latitudes and longitudes of all, or mo&s;t of the principal head lands and bays, may be confided in, for we &s;eldom failed of getting an ob&s;er|vation once at lea&s;t every day, by which to correct the lati|tude of our reckoning, and ob&s;ervations for &s;ettling the lon|gitude were equally numerous, no opportunity that was of|fered by the &s;un and moon being &s;uffered to e&s;cape. It would be injurious to the memory of Mr: Green, not to take this opportunity of atte&s;ting that he was indefatigable both in making ob&s;ervations and calculating upon them; and that, by his in&s;tructions and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, many of the petty officers were enabled both to ob&s;erve and calculate with great exactne&s;s. This method of finding the longitude at &s;ea, may be put into univer&s;al practice, and may always be depended upon within half a degree, which is &s;ufficient for all nautical pur|po&s;es. If, therefore, ob&s;erving and calculating were con&s;i|dered as nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for every &s;ea officer, the la|bour of the &s;peculative theori&s;t to &s;olve this problem might be remitted, without much injury to mankind: neither will it
<PB N="136" REF="013324_0425_0F8FFB726716E5A0">
be &s;o difficult to acquire this qualification, or put it in prac|tice, as may at fir&s;t appear; for, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the nautical almanack, and a&s;tronomical ephemeris, the calcu|lations for finding the longitude will take up little more time than the calculation of an azimuth, for finding the va|riation of the compa&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Departure from New South Wales; a particular De&s;cription of the Country, its Products, and People: A Specimen of the Language, and &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon the Currents and Tides.</HEAD>
<P>OF this country, its products, and its people, many parti|culars have already been related in the cour&s;e of the narrative, being &s;o interwoven with the events, as not to ad|mit of a &s;eparation. I &s;hall now give a more full and cir|cum&s;tantial de&s;cription of each, in which, if &s;ome things &s;hould happen to be repeated, the greater part will be found new.</P>
<P>New Holland, or, as I have now called the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, New South Wales, is of a larger extent than any other coun|try in the known world that does bear the name of a conti|nent: the length of coa&s;t along which we &s;ailed, reduced to a &s;treight line, is no le&s;s than twenty-&s;even degrees of lati|tude, amounting to near 2000 miles, &s;o that its &s;quare &s;urface mu&s;t be much more than equal to all Europe. To the &s;outh|ward of 33 or 34, the land in general is low and level; far|ther northward it is hilly, but in no part can be called moun|tainous, and the hills and mountains, taken together, make but a &s;mall part of the &s;urface, in compari&s;on with the vallies and plains. It is upon the whole rather barren than fertile, yet the ri&s;ing ground is chequered by woods and lawns, and the plains and vallies are in many places covered with herbage: the &s;oil however is frequently &s;andy, and many of the lawns, or &s;avannahs, are rocky and barren, e&s;pecially to the north|ward, where, in the be&s;t &s;pots, vegetation was le&s;s vigorous than in the &s;outhern part of the country; the trees were not &s;o tall, nor was the herbage &s;o rich. The gra&s;s in general is high, but thin, and the trees, where they are large&s;t, are &s;el|dom le&s;s than forty feet a&s;under; nor is the country inland, as far as we could examine it, better clothed than the &s;ea coa&s;t. The banks of the bays are covered with mangroves, to the di&s;tance of a mile within the beach, under which the &s;oil is a rank mud, that is always overflowed by a &s;pring tide; far|ther in the country we &s;ometimes met with a bog, upon which
<PB N="137" REF="013324_0426_0F90F235C393D138">
the gra&s;s was very thick and luxurient, and &s;ometimes with a valley, that was clothed with underwood: the &s;oil in &s;ome parts &s;eemed to be capable of improvement, but the far greater part is &s;uch as can admit of no cultivation. The coa&s;t, at lea&s;t that part of it which lies to the northward of 25&deg; S. abounds with fine bays and harbours, where ve&s;&s;els may lie in perfect &s;ecurity from all winds.</P>
<P>If we may judge by the appearance of the country while we were there, which was in the very height of the dry &s;ea|&s;on, it is well watered: we found innumerable &s;mall brooks and &s;prings, but no great rivers; the&s;e brooks, however, pro|bably become large in the rainy &s;ea&s;on. Thir&s;ty &s;ound was the only place where fre&s;h water was not to be procured for the &s;hip, and even there one or two &s;mall pools were found in the woods, though the face of the country was every where in|ter&s;ected by &s;alt-creeks, and mangrove land.</P>
<P>Of trees there is no great variety. Of tho&s;e that could be called timber, there are but two &s;orts; the large&s;t is the gum tree, which grows all over the country, and has been men|tioned already: it has narrow leaves, not much unlike a wil|low; and the gum, or rather re&s;in, which it yields, is of a deep red, and re&s;embles the <HI>&s;anguis draconis;</HI> po&s;&s;ibly it may be the &s;ame, for this &s;ub&s;tance is known to be the produce of more than one plant. It is mentioned by Dampier, and is perhaps the &s;ame that Ta&s;man found upon Diemen's land, where he &s;ays he &s;aw "gum of the trees, and gum lac of the ground." The other timber tree is that which grows &s;ome|what like our pines, and has been particularly mentioned in the account of Botany Bay. The wood of both the&s;e trees, as I have before remarked, is extremely hard and heavy. Be|&s;ides the&s;e, here are trees covered with a &s;oft bark that is ea&s;ily peeled off, and is the &s;ame that in the Ea&s;t-Indies is u&s;ed for the caulking of &s;hips.</P>
<P>We found here the palm of three different &s;orts. The fir&s;t, which grows in great plenty to the &s;outhward, has leaves that are plaited like a fan: the cabbage of the&s;e is &s;mall, but ex|qui&s;itely &s;weet; and the nuts, which it bears in great abun|dance, are very good food for hogs. The &s;econd &s;ort bore a much greater re&s;emblance to the true cabbage tree of the We&s;t-Indies; its leaves were large and pinnated, like tho&s;e of the cocoa-nut; and the&s;e al&s;o produced a cabbage, which, though not &s;o &s;weet as the other, was much larger. The third &s;ort, which, like the &s;econd, was found only in the northern parts, was &s;eldom more than ten feet high, with &s;mall pinnated leaves, re&s;embling tho&s;e of &s;ome kind of fern: it bore no cabbage, but a plentiful crop of nuts, about the &s;ize of a large che&s;nut, but rounder: as we found the hulls of the&s;e &s;cattered round the places where the Indians had made their fires, we
<PB N="138" REF="013324_0427_0F90F23689BC2C18">
took for granted that they were fit to eat; tho&s;e however, who made the experiment paid dear for their knowledge of the contrary, for they operated both as an emetic and cathartic with great violence. Still, however, we made no doubt but that they were eaten by the Indians; and judging that the con&s;titution of the hogs might be as &s;trong as theirs, tho' our own had proved to be &s;o much inferior, we carried them to the &s;tye; the hogs eat them, indeed, and for &s;ome time we tho't without &s;uffering any inconvenience; but in about a week they were &s;o much di&s;ordered that two of them died, and the re&s;t were recovered with great difficulty. It is probable, how|ever, that the poi&s;onous quality of the&s;e nuts may lie in the juice, like that of the ca&s;&s;ada of the We&s;t Indies; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the pulp, when dried, may be not only whole&s;ome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;pecies of the palm, and mangroves, there were &s;everal &s;mall trees and &s;hrubs, altogether unknown in Europe; particularly one which produced a very poor kind of fig; another that bore what we called a plum, which it re&s;embled in colour, but not in &s;hape, being flat on the &s;ides like a little chee&s;e; and a third that bore a kind of purple apple; which, after it had been kept a few days, became eat|able, and ta&s;ted &s;omewhat like a dama&s;cene.</P>
<P>Here is a great variety of plants to enrich the collection of a botani&s;t, but very few of them are of the ae&s;culent kind. A &s;mall plant, with long, narrow, gra&s;&s;y leaves, re&s;embling that kind of bulru&s;h which in England is called the Cat's-tail, yields a re&s;in of a bright yellow colour, exactly re&s;embling gambouge, except that it does not &s;tain; it has a &s;weet &s;mell, but its properties we had no opportunity to di&s;cover, any more than tho&s;e of many others with which the natives appear to be ac-quainted, as they have di&s;tingui&s;hed them by names.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned the root and leaves of a plant re&s;embling the coccos of the We&s;t Indies, and a kind of bean; to which may be added, a &s;ort of par&s;ley and pur&s;elain, and two kinds of yams; one &s;haped like a rhadi&s;h, and the other round, and covered with &s;tringy fibres: both &s;orts are very &s;mall, but &s;weet; and we never could find the plants that pro|duced them, though we often &s;aw the places where they had been newly dug up; it is probable that the drought had de&s;troy|ed the leaves, and we could not, like the Indians, di&s;cover them by the &s;talks.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the fruits of this country, &s;uch as they are, have been mentioned already. We found one in the &s;outhern part of the country re&s;embling a cherry, except that the &s;tone was &s;oft; and another not unlike a pine-aple in appearance, but of a very di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, which is well know in the Ea&s;t Indies, and is called by the Dutch <HI>Pyn Appel Boomen.</HI></P>
<P>Of the quadrupeds, I have already mentioned the dog, and
<PB N="139" REF="013324_0428_0F8FFB72D5B288F0">
particularly de&s;cribed the kanguroo, and the animal of the opo&s;&s;um kind, re&s;embling the phalanger of Buffon; to which I can add only one more, re&s;embling a polecat, which the natives call <HI>Quoll;</HI> the back is brown, &s;potted with white, and the belly white unmixed. Several of our people &s;aid they had &s;een wolves; but perhaps, if we had not &s;een tracks that favoured the account, we might have thought them little more worthy of credit than he who reported that he had &s;een the devil.</P>
<P>Of batts, which hold a middle place between the bea&s;ts and the birds, we &s;aw many kinds, particularly one which, as I have ob&s;erved already, was larger than a partridge; we were not fortunate enough to take one either alive or dead, but it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame as Buffon has de&s;cribed by the name of <HI>Rou&s;et</HI> or <HI>Rouget.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ea and other water-fowl of this country, are gulls, &s;haggs, &s;oland gee&s;e, or gannets, of two &s;orts; boobies, nod|dies, curlieus, ducks, pelicans of an enormous &s;ize, and ma|ny others. The land birds are crows, parrots, paroquets, cockatoos, and other birds of the &s;ame kind, of exqui&s;ite beau|ty; pigeons, doves, quails, bu&s;tards, herons, cranes, hawks, and eagles. The pigeons flew in numerous flocks, &s;o that, notwith&s;tanding their extreme &s;hyne&s;s, our people frequently killed ten or twelve of them in a day: the&s;e birds are very beautiful, and cre&s;ted very differently from any we had &s;een before.</P>
<P>Among other reptiles, here are &s;erpents of various kinds, &s;ome noxious, and &s;ome harmle&s;s; &s;corpions, centipieds, and lizards. The infects are but few. The principal are the mu&s;quito, and the ant. Of the ant there are &s;everal &s;orts; &s;ome are as green as a leaf, and live upon trees, where they build their ne&s;ts of various &s;izes, between that of a man's head and his fi&s;t. The&s;e ne&s;ts are of a very curious &s;tructure: they are formed by bending down &s;everal of the leaves, each of which is as broad as a man's hand, and gluing the points of them together, &s;o as to form a pur&s;e; the vi&s;cus u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, is an animal juice, which nature has enabled them to elaborate. Their method of fir&s;t bending down the leaves, we had not an opportunity to ob&s;erve; but we &s;aw thou|&s;ands uniting all their &s;trength to hold them in this po&s;ition, while other bu&s;y multitudes were employed within, in apply|ing the gluten that was to prevent their returning back. To &s;atisfy our&s;elves that the leaves were bent, and held down by the effort of the&s;e diminutive artificers, we di&s;turbed them in their work, and as &s;oon as they were driven from their &s;tation, the leaves on which they were employed &s;prung up with a force much greater than we could have thought them able to conquer by any combination of their &s;trength. But
<PB N="140" REF="013324_0429_0F90F2374727B210">
though we gratified our curio&s;ity at their expence, the injury did not go unrevenged; for thou&s;ands immediately threw them&s;elves upon us, and gave us intolerable pain with their &s;tings, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our necks and our hair, from whence they were not ea&s;ily driven: the &s;ting was &s;carcely le&s;s painful than that of a bee; but, except it was repeated, the pain did not la&s;t more than a minute.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort are quite black, and their operations and man|ner of life are not le&s;s extraordinary. Their habitations are the in&s;ide of the branches of a tree, which they contrive to excavate by working out the pith almo&s;t to the extremity of the &s;lendere&s;t twig; the tree at the &s;ame time flouri&s;hing as if it had no &s;uch inmate. When we fir&s;t found the tree, we gathered &s;ome of the branches, and were &s;carcely le&s;s a&s;ton|i&s;hed than we &s;hould have been to find that we had prophaned a con&s;ecrated grove, where every tree, upon being wounded, gave &s;igns of life; for we were in&s;tantly covered with legions of the&s;e animals, &s;warming from every broken bough, and in|flicting their &s;tings with ince&s;&s;ant violence. They are men|tioned by Rumphius in his <HI>Herbarium Amboinen&s;e,</HI> vol. 2. p. 257; but the tree in which he &s;aw their dwelling, is very different from that in which we found them.</P>
<P>A third kind we found ne&s;ted in the root of a plant, which grows on the bark of trees in the manner of mi&s;letoe, and which they had perforated for that u&s;e. This root is common|ly as big as a large turnip, and &s;ometimes much bigger: when we cut it, we found it inter&s;ected by innumerable wind|ing pa&s;&s;ages, all filled with the&s;e animals, by which however the vegetation of the plant did not appear to have &s;uffered any injury. We never cut one of the&s;e roots that was not inha|bited, though &s;ome were not bigger than a hazel-nut. The animals them&s;elves are very &s;mall, not more than half as big as the common red ant in England. They had &s;tings but &s;carcely force enough to make them felt; they had however a power of tormenting us in an equal, if not a greater degree; for the moment we handled the root, they &s;warmed from in|numerable holes, and running about tho&s;e parts of the body that were uncovered, produced a titulation more intolerable than pain, except it is increa&s;ed to great violence. Rumphius has al&s;o given an account of this bulb and its inhabitants, vol. 6. p. 120. where he mentions another &s;ort that are black.</P>
<P>We found a fourth kind, which are perfectly harmle&s;s, and almo&s;t exactly re&s;emble the white-ants of the Ea&s;t-Indies; the architecture of the&s;e is &s;till more curious than that of the others. They have hou&s;es of two &s;orts, one is &s;u&s;pended on the branches of trees, and the other erected upon the ground: tho&s;e upon the trees are about tree or four times as big as a man's head, and are built of a brittle &s;ub&s;tance, which &s;eems
<PB N="141" REF="013324_0430_0F8FFB739EF06CE8">
to con&s;i&s;t of &s;mall parts of vegetables, kneaded together with a glutinous matter, which their bodies probably &s;upply; upon breaking this cru&s;t, innumerable cells, &s;warming with inha|bitants, appear in a great variety of winding directions, all communicating with each other, and with &s;everal apertures that led to other ne&s;ts upon the &s;ame tree: they have al&s;o one large avenue, or covered way, leading to the ground, and carried on under it to the other ne&s;t or hou&s;e that is con&s;tructed there. This hou&s;e is generally at the root of a tree, but not of that upon which their other dwellings are con&s;tructed: it is formed like an irregularly &s;ided cone, and &s;ometimes is more than &s;ix feet high, and nearly as much in diameter. Some are &s;maller, and the&s;e are generally flat &s;ided, and very much re&s;emble in figure the &s;tones which are &s;een in many parts of England, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be the remains of druidical anti|quity. The out&s;ide of the&s;e is of well tempered clay, about two inches thick; and within are the cells, which have no opening outwards, but communicate only with the &s;ubterra|nean way to the hou&s;es on the tree, and to the tree near which they are con&s;tructed, where they a&s;cend up the root, and &s;o up the trunk and branches, under covered ways of the &s;ame kind as tho&s;e by which they de&s;cended from their other dwellings. To the&s;e &s;tructures on the ground they probably retire in the winter, or rainy &s;ea&s;ons, as they are proof again&s;t any wet that can fall; which tho&s;e in the tree, though generally con|&s;tructed under &s;ome overhanging branch, from the nature and thinne&s;s of their cru&s;t or wall, cannot be.</P>
<P>The &s;ea in this country is much more liberal of food to the inhabitants than the land; and though fi&s;h is not quite &s;o plenty here as they generally are in higher latitudes, yet we &s;eldom hauled the &s;eine without taking from fifty to two hund|red weight. They are of various &s;orts; but, except the mul|let, and &s;ome of the &s;hell-fi&s;h, none of them are known in Europe: mo&s;t of them are palatable, and &s;ome are very deli|cious. Upon the &s;hoals and reef there are incredible numbers of the fine&s;t green turtle in the world, and oy&s;ters of various kinds, particularly the rock oy&s;ter and the pearl-oy&s;ter. The gigantic cockles have been mentioned already; be&s;ides which there are &s;ea-crayfi&s;h, or lob&s;ters, and crabs; of the&s;e however we &s;aw only the &s;hells. In the rivers and &s;alt creeks there are aligators.</P>
<P>The only per&s;on who has hitherto given any account of this country, or its inhabitants, is Dampier, and though he is, in general, a writer of credit, yet in many particulars he is mi&s;taken. The people whom he &s;aw were indeed inhabitants of a part of the coa&s;t very di&s;tant from each other, and there being a perfect uniformity in per&s;on and cu&s;toms among them
<PB N="142" REF="013324_0431_0F90F238C2C8A580">
all, it is rea&s;onable to conclude, that di&s;tance in another di|rection has not con&s;iderably broken it.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in this country appears to be very &s;mall in proportion to its extent. We never &s;aw &s;o many as thirty of them together but once, and that was at Botany Bay, when men, women, and children, a&s;&s;embled upon a rock to &s;ee the &s;hip pa&s;s by: when they manife&s;tly formed a re&s;olution to engage us, they never could mu&s;ter above fourteen or fifteen fighting men; and we never &s;aw a number of their &s;hed or hou&s;es together that could accommodate a larger party. It is true, indeed, that we &s;aw only the &s;ea-coa&s;t on the ea&s;tern &s;ide; and that, between this and the we&s;tern &s;hore, there is an immen&s;e tract of country wholly unexplored: but there is great rea&s;on to believe that this immen&s;e tract is either wholly de&s;olate, or at lea&s;t &s;till more thinly inhabited than the parts we vi&s;ited. It is impo&s;&s;ible that the inland country &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t inhabitants at all &s;ea&s;ons without cultivation; it is ex|tremely improbable that the inhabitants of the coa&s;t &s;hould be totally ignorant of arts of cultivation, which were practi&s;ed in|land; and it is equally improbable that, if they knew &s;uch arts, there &s;hould be no traces of them among them. It is certain that we did not &s;ee one foot of ground in a &s;tate of cul|tivation in the whole country; and therefore it may well be concluded that where the &s;ea does not contribute to feed the inhabitants, the country is not inhabited.</P>
<P>The only tribe with which we had any intercour&s;e, we found where the &s;hip was careened; it con&s;i&s;ted of one and twenty per&s;ons; twelve men, &s;even women, one boy, and one girl: the women we never &s;aw but at a di&s;tance; for when the men came over the river they were always left behind. The men here, and in other places, were of a middle &s;ize, and in gene|ral well made, clean limbed, and remarkably vigorous, active, and nimble: their countenances were not altogether without expre&s;&s;ion, and their voices were remarkably &s;oft and effe|minate.</P>
<P>Their &s;kins were &s;o uniformely covered with dirt, that it was very difficult to a&s;certain their true colour: we made &s;e|veral attempts, by wetting our fingers and rubbing it, to re|move the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ustations, but with very little effect. With the dirt they appear nearly as black as a negro; and according to our be&s;t di&s;coveries, the &s;kin is of the colour of wood foot, or what is commonly called a chocolate colour. Their features are far from being di&s;agreeable, their no&s;es are not flat, nor are their lips thick; their teeth are white and even, and their hair naturally long and black, it is however univer&s;ally crop|ped &s;hort; in general it is &s;trait, but &s;ometimes it has a &s;light curl; we &s;aw none that was not matted and filthy, though without oil or grea&s;e, and to our great a&s;toni&s;hment free from
<PB N="143" REF="013324_0432_0F8FFB7456A98768">
lice. Their beards were of the &s;ame colour with their hair, and bu&s;hy and thick: they are not however &s;uffered to grow long. A man whom we had &s;een one day with his beard &s;omewhat longer than his companions, we &s;aw the next, with it &s;omewhat &s;horter, and upon examination found the ends of the hair burnt: from this incident, and our having never &s;een any &s;harp in&s;trument among them, we concluded that both the hair and the beard were kept &s;hort by &s;inging them.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes, as I have already ob&s;erved, go &s;tark naked, and &s;eem to have no more &s;en&s;e of indecency in di&s;covering the whole body, than we have in di&s;covering our hands and face. Their principal ornament is the bone which they thru&s;t thro' the cartilage that divides the no&s;trils from each other: what perver&s;ion of ta&s;te could make them think this a decoration, or what could prompt them, before they had worn it, or &s;een it worn, to &s;uffer the pain or inconvenience that mu&s;t of nece&s;|&s;ity attend it, is perhaps beyond the power of human &s;agacity to determine: as this bone is as thick as a man's finger, and between five and &s;ix inches long, it reaches quite acro&s;s the face, and &s;o effectually &s;tops up both the no&s;trils that they are forced to keep their mouths wide open for breath, and &s;nuffle &s;o when they attempt to &s;peak, that they are &s;carcely intel|ligible even to each other. Our &s;eamen, with &s;ome humour, called it their &s;prit-&s;ail-yard; and indeed it had &s;o ludicrous an appearance, that till we were u&s;ed to it, we found it diffi|cult to refrain from laughter. Be&s;ide this no&s;e-jewel, they had necklaces made of &s;hells, very neatly cut and &s;trung toge|ther; bracelets of &s;mall cord, wound two or three times about the upper part of their arm, and a &s;tring of plaited human hair, about as thick as a thread of yarn, tied round the wai&s;t. Be|&s;ides the&s;e, &s;ome of them had gorgets of &s;hells hanging round the neck, &s;o as to reach cro&s;s the brea&s;t. But though the&s;e people wear no clothes, their bodies have a covering be&s;ides the dirt, for they paint them both white and red: the red is commonly laid on in broad patches upon the &s;houlders and brea&s;t; and the white in &s;tripes, &s;ome narrow, and &s;ome broad: the narrow were drawn over the limbs, and the broad over the body, not without &s;ome degree of ta&s;te. The white was al&s;o laid on in &s;mall patches upon the face, and drawn in a circle round each eye. The red &s;eemed to be ochre, but what the white was we could not di&s;cover; it was clo&s;e grained, &s;a|ponaceous to the touch, and almo&s;t as heavy as white lead; po&s;&s;ibly it might be a kind of <HI>Steatites,</HI> but to our great regret we could not procure a bit of it to examine. They have holes in their ears, but we never &s;aw any thing worn in them. Upon &s;uch ornaments as they had, they &s;et &s;o great a value, that they would never part with the lea&s;t article for any thing we could offer; which was the more extraordinary as our beads
<PB N="144" REF="013324_0433_0F90F23983C78780">
and ribbons were ornaments of the &s;ame kind, but of a more regular form, and more &s;howy materials. They had indeed no idea of traffic, nor could we communicate any to them: they received the things that we gave them; but never ap|peared to under&s;tand our &s;igns when we required a return. The &s;ame indifference which prevented them from buying what we had, prevented them al&s;o from attempting to &s;teal: If they had coveted more they would have been le&s;s hone&s;t; for when we refu&s;ed to give them a turtle, they were enraged, and attempted to take it by force, and we had nothing el&s;e upon which they &s;et the lea&s;t value; for, as I have before ob|&s;erved, many of the things that we had given them, we found left negligently about in the woods, like the play-things of children, which plea&s;e only while they are new. Upon their bodies we &s;aw no marks of di&s;ea&s;e or &s;ores, but large &s;cars in irregular lines, which appeared to be the remains of wounds which they had inflicted upon them&s;elves with &s;ome blunt in|&s;trument, and which we under&s;tood by &s;igns to have been me|morials of grief for the dead.</P>
<P>They appeared to have no fixed habitations, for we &s;aw nothing like a town or village in the whole country. Their hou&s;es (if hou&s;es they may be called) &s;eem to be formed with le&s;s art and indu&s;try than any we had &s;een, except the wretched hovels at Terra del Fuego, and in &s;ome re&s;pects they are infe|rior even to them. At Botany Bay, where they were be&s;t, they where ju&s;t high enough for a man to &s;it upright in; but not large enough for him to extend him&s;elf in his whole length in any direction: they are built with pliable rods about as thick as a man's finger, in the form of an oven, by &s;ticking the two ends into the ground, and then covering them with palm leaves, and broad pieces of bark: the door is nothing but a large hole at one end, oppo&s;ite to which the fire is made, as we perceived by the a&s;hes. Under the&s;e hou&s;es, or &s;heds, they &s;leep, coiled up with their heels to their head; and in this po&s;ition one of them will hold three or four per&s;ons. As we advanced northward, and the climate became warmer, we found the&s;e &s;heds &s;till more &s;light: they were built, like the others, of twigs, and covered with bark; but none of them were more than four feet deep, and one &s;ide was intirely open: the clo&s;e &s;ide was always oppo&s;ed to the cour&s;e of the prevail|ing wind, and oppo&s;ite to the open &s;ide was the fire, probably more as a defence from the mu&s;quitos than the cold. Under the&s;e hovels it is probable, that they thru&s;t only their heads, and the upper part of their bodies, extending their feet to|wards the fire. They were &s;et up occa&s;ionally by a wandering hord, in any place that would furni&s;h them for a time with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and left behind them when (after it was exhau&s;t|ed) they went away: but in places where they remained only
<PB N="145" REF="013324_0434_0F90F23A398C1610">
a night or two, they &s;lept without any &s;helter, except the bu&s;hes or gra&s;s, which is here near two feet high. We ob|&s;erved, however, that though the &s;leeping huts which we found upon the main, were always turned from the prevailing wind, tho&s;e upon the i&s;lands were turned towards it; which &s;eems to be a proof that they have a mild &s;ea&s;on here, during which the &s;ea is calm, and that the &s;ame weather which en|ables them to vi&s;it the i&s;lands, makes the air welcome even while they &s;leep.</P>
<P>The only furniture belonging to the&s;e hou&s;es that fell un|der our ob&s;ervation, is a kind of oblong ve&s;&s;el made of bark, by the &s;imple contrivance of tying up the two ends with a withy, which not being cut off &s;erves for a handle; the&s;e we imagined were u&s;ed as buckets to fetch water from the &s;pring, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ometimes to be at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance. They have however a &s;mall bag, about the &s;ize of a moderate cabbage-net, which is made by laying threads loop within loop, &s;omewhat in the manner of knit|ing u&s;ed by our ladies to make pur&s;es. This bag the man carries loo&s;e upon his back, by a &s;mall &s;tring which pa&s;&s;es over his head; it generally contains a lump or two of paint and re&s;in, &s;ome fi&s;h-hooks and lines, a &s;hell or two, out of which their hooks are made, a few points of darts, and their u&s;ual ornaments, which includes the whole worldly trea&s;ure of the riche&s;t man among them.</P>
<P>Their fi&s;h-hooks are very neatly made, and &s;ome of them are exceedingly &s;mall. For &s;triking turtle they have a peg of wood which is about a foot long, and very well bearded; this fits into a &s;ocket at the end of a &s;taff of light wood, about as thick as a man's wri&s;t, and about &s;even or eight feet long: to the &s;taff is tied one end of a loo&s;e line, about three or four fathom long, the other end of which is fa&s;tened to the peg. To &s;trike the turtle, the peg is fixed into the &s;ocket, and when it has entered his body, and is retained there by the barb, the &s;taff flies off and &s;erves for a float to trace their victim in the water; it a&s;&s;i&s;ts al&s;o to tire him, till they can overtake him with their canoes, and haul him a&s;hore. One of the&s;e pegs, as I have mentioned already, we found buried in the body of a turtle, which had healed up over it. Their lines are from the thickne&s;s of a half inch rope to the finene&s;s of a hair, and are made of &s;ome vegetable &s;ub&s;tance, but what in particular we had no opportunity to learn.</P>
<P>Their food is chiefly fi&s;h, though they &s;ometimes contrive to kill the kangaroo, and even birds of various kinds; not|with&s;tanding they are &s;o &s;hy that we found it difficult to get within reach of them with a fowling-piece. The only vege|table that can be con&s;idered as an article of food is the yam; yet doubtle&s;s they eat the &s;everal fruits which have been men|tioned
<PB N="146" REF="013324_0435_0F905011C578A668">
among other productions of the country; and indeed we &s;aw the &s;hells and hulls of &s;everal of them lying about the places where they had kindled their fire.</P>
<P>They do not appear to eat any animal food raw; but hav|ing no ve&s;&s;el in which water can be boiled, they either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it upon the coals, or bake it in a hole by the help of hot &s;tones, in the &s;ame manner as is practi&s;ed by the inhabitants of the i&s;lands in the South Seas.</P>
<P>Whether they are acquainted with any plant that has an in|toxicating quality, we do not know; but we ob&s;erved that &s;everal of them held leaves of &s;ome &s;ort con&s;tantly in their mouths, as an European does tobacco, and an Ea&s;t Indian betele, but whatever it was, it had no effect upon the teeth or the lips.</P>
<P>As they have no nets, they catch fi&s;h only by &s;triking, or with a hook and line, except &s;uch as they find in the hol|lows of the rocks and &s;hoals, which are dry at half ebb.</P>
<P>Their manner of hunting we had no opportunity to &s;ee; but we conjectured by the notches which they had every where cut in large trees in order to climb them, that they took their &s;tations near the tops of them, and there watched for &s;uch ani|mals as might happen to pa&s;s near enough to be reached by their lances: it is po&s;&s;ible al&s;o, that in this &s;ituation they might take birds when they came to roo&s;t.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved that when they went from our tents upon the banks of Endeavour river, we could trace them by the fires which they kindled in their way; and we imagined that the&s;e fires were intended &s;ome way for the taking the kangu|roo, which we ob&s;erved to be &s;o much afraid of fire, that our dogs could &s;carcely force it over places which had been newly burnt, though the fire was extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>They produce fire with great facility, and &s;pread it in a wonderful manner. To produce it they take two pieces of dry &s;oft wood, one is a &s;tick about eight or nine inches long, the other piece is flat: the &s;tick they &s;hape into an obtu&s;e point at one end, and pre&s;&s;ing it upon the other, turn it nimb|ly by holding it between both their hands as we do a chocolate mill, often &s;hifting their hands up, and then moving them down upon it, to increa&s;e the pre&s;&s;ure as much as po&s;&s;ible. By this method they get fire in le&s;s than two minutes, and from the &s;malle&s;t &s;park they increa&s;e it with great &s;peed and dexte|rity. We have often &s;een one of them run along the &s;hore, to all appearance with nothing in his hand, who &s;tooping down for a moment, at the di&s;tance of every fifty or a hundred yards, left fire behind him, as we could &s;ee fir&s;t by the &s;moke, and then by the flame among the drift wood, and other litter which was &s;cattered along the place. We had the curio&s;ity to examine one of the&s;e planters of fire, when he &s;ett off, and we
<PB N="147" REF="013324_0436_0F90EC98B1E8A838">
&s;aw him wrap up a &s;mall &s;park in dry gra&s;s, which, when he had run a little way, having been fanned by the air that his motion produced, began to blaze; he then laid it down in a place convenient for his purpo&s;e, inclo&s;ing a &s;park of it in an|other quantity of gra&s;s, and &s;o continued his cour&s;e.</P>
<P>There are perhaps few things in the hi&s;tory of mankind more extraordinary than the di&s;covery and application of fire: it will &s;carcely be di&s;puted that the manner of pro|ducing it, whether by colli&s;ion or attrition, was di&s;covered by chance: but its fir&s;t effects would naturally &s;trike tho&s;e to whom it was a new object, with con&s;ternation and terror: it would appear to be an enemy to life and nature, and to tor|ment and de&s;troy whatever was capable of being de&s;troyed or tormented; and therefore it &s;eems not ea&s;y to conceive what &s;hould incline tho&s;e who fir&s;t &s;aw it receive a tran&s;ient exi&s;|tence from chance, to produce it by de&s;ign. It is by no means probable that tho&s;e who fir&s;t &s;aw &s;ire, approached it with the &s;ame caution, as tho&s;e who are familiar with its effects, &s;o as to be warmed only and not burnt; and it is rea&s;onable to think that the intolerable pain which, at its fir&s;t appearance, it mu&s;t produce upon ignorant curio&s;ity, would &s;ow perpetual enmity between this element and mankind; and that the &s;ame principle which incites them to cru&s;h a &s;erpent, would incite them to de&s;troy fire, and avoid all means by which it would be produced, as &s;oon as they were known. The&s;e circum|&s;tances con&s;idered, how men became &s;ufficiently familiar with it to render it u&s;eful, &s;eems to be a problem very difficult to &s;olve: nor is it ea&s;y to account for the fir&s;t application of it to culinary purpo&s;es, as the eating both animal and vegetable food raw, mu&s;t have become a habit, before there was fire to dre&s;s it, and tho&s;e who have con&s;idered the force of habit will readily believe, that to men who had always eaten the fle&s;h of animals raw, it would be as di&s;agreeable dre&s;&s;ed, as to tho&s;e who have always eaten it dre&s;&s;ed, it would be raw. It is re|markable that the inhabitants of Terra del Fuego produce fire from a &s;park by colli&s;ion, and that the happier natives of this country, New Zealand and Otaheite, produce it by the attri|tion of one combu&s;tible &s;ub&s;tance again&s;t another: is there not then the &s;ame rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e different operations corre&s;pond with the manner in which chance produced fire in the neighbourhood of the torrid and frigid zones? Among the rude inhabitants of a cold country, neither any operation of art, or concurrence of accident, could be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o ea&s;ily to produce fire by attrition, as in a climate where every thing is hot, dry, and adu&s;t, teeming with a latent fire which a &s;light degree of motion was &s;ufficient to call forth; in a cold country therefore, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that fire was pro|duced by the accidental colli&s;ion of two metallic &s;ub&s;tances,
<PB N="148" REF="013324_0437_0F90F23B159D7A50">
and in a cold country for that rea&s;on, the &s;ame expedient was u&s;ed to produce it by de&s;ign: but in hot countries, where two combu&s;tible &s;ub&s;tances ea&s;ily kindle by attrition, it is pro|bable that the attrition of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances fir&s;t produced fire, and here it was therefore natural for art to adopt the &s;ame ope|ration, with a view to produce the &s;ame effect. It may in|deed be true that fire is now produced in many cold countries by attrition, and in many hot by a &s;troke; but perhaps upon enquiry there may appear rea&s;on to conclude that this has ari&s;en from the communication of one country with another, and that with re&s;pect to the original production of fire in hot and cold countries, the di&s;tinction is well founded.</P>
<P>There may perhaps be &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that men became gradually acquainted with the nature and effects of fire, by its permanent exi&s;tence in a volcano, there being re|mains of volcanoes, or ve&s;tiges of their effects, in almo&s;t every part of the world: by a volcano, however, no method of pro|ducing fire, otherwi&s;e than by contact, could be learnt; the production and application of fire therefore, &s;till &s;eem to af|ford abundant &s;ubject of &s;peculation to the curious.</P>
<P>The weapons of the&s;e people are &s;pears or lances, and the&s;e are of different kinds: &s;ome that we &s;aw upon the &s;outh|ern part of the coa&s;t had four prongs, pointed with bone, and barbed; the points were al&s;o &s;meared with a hard re&s;in, which gave them a poli&s;h, and made them enter deeper into what they &s;truck. To the northward, the lance has but one point: the &s;haft is made of cane, or the &s;talk of a plant &s;omewhat re|&s;embling a bulru&s;h, very &s;treight and light, and from eight to fourteen feet long, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal joints, where the pieces are let into each other, and bound together; to this are fitted points of different kinds; &s;ome are of hard heavy wood, and &s;ome are the bones of fi&s;h: we &s;aw &s;everal that were point|ed with the &s;tings of the &s;ting-ray, the large&s;t that they could procure, and barbed with &s;everal that were &s;maller, fa&s;tened on in a contrary direction; the points of wood were al&s;o &s;ometimes armed with &s;harp pieces of broken &s;hells, which were &s;tuck in, and at the junctures covered with re&s;in: the lances that are thus barbed, are indeed dreadful weapons, for when once they have taken place, they can never be drawn back without tear|ing away the fle&s;h, or leaving the &s;harp ragged &s;plinters of the bone or &s;hell, which forms the beard, behind them in the wound. The&s;e weapons are thrown with great force and dex|terity; if intended to wound at a &s;hort di&s;tance, between ten and twenty yards, &s;imply with the hand, but if at the di&s;tance of forty or fifty, with an in&s;trument which we called a throw|ing &s;tick. This is a plain &s;mooth piece of a hard reddi&s;h wood, very highly poli&s;hed, about two inches broad, half an inch thick, and three feet long, with a &s;mall knob, or hook
<PB N="149" REF="013324_0438_0F90F23BBA153B70">
at one end, and a cro&s;s piece about three or four inches long at the others the knob at one end is received in a &s;mall dent or hollow, which is made for that purpo&s;e in the &s;haft of the lance, near the point, but from which it ea&s;ily &s;lips, upon be|ing impelled forward: when the lance is laid along upon this machine, and &s;ecured in a proper po&s;ition by the knob, the per&s;on that is to throw it holds it over his &s;houlder, and after &s;haking it, delivers both the throwing &s;tick and lance with all his force, but the &s;tick being &s;topped by the cro&s;s piece which comes again&s;t the &s;houlder, with a &s;udden jerk, the lance flies forward with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, and with &s;o good an aim, that at the di&s;tance of fifty yards the&s;e Indians were more &s;ure of their mark than we could be with a &s;ingle bullet. Be&s;ides the&s;e lances we &s;aw no offen&s;ive weapon upon this coa&s;t, ex|cept when we took our la&s;t view of it with our gla&s;&s;es, and then we thought we &s;aw a man with a bow and arrows, in which it is po&s;&s;ible we might be mi&s;taken. We &s;aw, how|ever, at Botany Bay, a &s;hield or target, of an oblong &s;hape, about three feet long, and eighteen inches broad, which was made of the bark of a tree: this was fetched out of a but by one of the men that oppo&s;ed our landing, who, when he ran away, left it behind him, and upon taking it up, we found that it had been pierced through with a &s;ingle pointed lance near the center. The&s;e &s;hields are certainly in frequent u&s;e among the people here, for though this was the only one that we &s;aw in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we frequently found trees from which they appeared manife&s;tly to have been cut, the marks being ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e that were made by cut|ting buckets: &s;ometimes al&s;o we found the &s;hields cut out, but not yet taken off from the tree, the edges of the bark on|ly being a little rai&s;ed by wedges, &s;o that the&s;e people appear to have di&s;covered that the bark of a tree becomes thicker and &s;tronger by being &s;uffered to remain upon the trunk after it has been cut round.</P>
<P>The canoes of New Holland are as mean and rude as the hou&s;es. Tho&s;e on the &s;outhern part of the coa&s;t are nothing more than a piece of bark, about twelve feet long, tied toge|ther at the ends, and kept open in the middle by &s;mall bows of wood: yet in a ve&s;&s;el of this con&s;truction we once &s;aw three people. In &s;hallow water they are &s;et forward by a pole, and in deeper by paddles, about eighteen inches long, one of which the boatman holds in each hand; mean as they are, they have many conveniences, they draw but little water, and they are very light, &s;o that they go upon mud banks to pick up &s;hell fi&s;h, the mo&s;t important u&s;e to which they can be ap|plied, better perhaps than ve&s;&s;els of any other con&s;truction. We ob&s;erved, that in the middle of the&s;e canoes there was a
<PB N="150" REF="013324_0439_0F90F23C79D1D970">
heap of &s;ea-weed, and upon that a &s;mall fire; probably that the fi&s;h may be broiled and eaten the moment it is caught.</P>
<P>The canoes that we &s;aw when we advanced farther to the northward, are not made of bark, but of the trunk of a tree hollowed, perhaps by fire. They are about fourteen feet long, and, being very narrow, are fitted with an outrigger, to pre|vent their over&s;etting. The&s;e are worked with paddles, that are &s;o large as to require both hands to manage one of them: the out&s;ide is wholly unmarked by any tool, but at each end the wood is left longer at the top than at the bottom, &s;o that there is a projection beyond the hollow part, re&s;embling the end of a plank; the &s;ides are tolerably thin, but how the tree is felled and fa&s;hioned, we had no opportunity to learn. The only tools that we &s;aw among them are an adze, wretch|edly made of &s;tone, &s;ome &s;mall pieces of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance in form of a wedge, a wooden mallet, and &s;ome &s;hells and fragments of coral. For poli&s;hing their throwing &s;ticks, and the points of their lances, they u&s;e the leaves of a kind of wild fig-tree, which bites upon wood almo&s;t as keenly as the &s;have|gra&s;s of Europe, which is u&s;ed by our joiners: with &s;uch tools, the making even &s;uch a canoe as I have de&s;cribed, mu&s;t be a mo&s;t difficult and tedious labour: to tho&s;e who have been ac|cu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of metal, it appears altogether imprac|ticable; but there are few difficulties that will not yield to patient per&s;everance, and he who does all he can, will cer|tainly produce effects that greatly exceed his apparent power.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t freight of the&s;e canoes is four people, and if more at any time wanted to come over the river, one of tho&s;e who came fir&s;t was obliged to go back for the re&s;t: from this circum&s;tance we conjectured that the boat we &s;aw, when we were lying in Endeavour River, was the only one in the neigh|bourhood: we have however &s;ome rea&s;on to believe that the bark canoes are al&s;o u&s;ed where the wooden ones are con|&s;tructed, for upon one of the &s;mall i&s;lands where the natives had been fi&s;hing for turtle, we found one of the little paddles, which had belonged to &s;uch a boat, and would have been u&s;e|le&s;s on board any other.</P>
<P>By what means the inhabitants of this country are reduced to &s;uch a number as it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, is not perhaps very ea&s;y to gue&s;s; whether, like the inhabitants of New Zealand, they are de&s;troyed by the hands of each other in conte&s;ts for food; whether they are &s;wept off by accidental famine, or whether there is any cau&s;e which prevents the increa&s;e of the &s;pecies, mu&s;t be left to future adventurers to determine. That they have wars, appears by their weapons; for &s;uppo&s;ing the lances to &s;erve merely for the &s;triking of fi&s;h, the &s;hield could be intended for nothing but a defence again&s;t men; the only mark of ho&s;tility, however, which we &s;aw among them, was
<PB N="151" REF="013324_0440_0F90F23D3ABBFED8">
the perforation of the &s;hield by a &s;pear which has been ju&s;t mentioned, for none of them appeared to have been wounded by an enemy. Neither can we determine whether they are pu&s;ilanimous or brave; the re&s;olution with which two of them attempted to prevent our landing, when we had two boats full of men, in Botany Bay, even after one of them was wound|ed with &s;mall &s;hot, gave us rea&s;on to conclude that they were not only naturally courageous, but that they had acquired a familiarity with the dangers of ho&s;tility, and were, by habit as well as nature, a daring and warlike people; but their pre|cipitate flight from every other place that we approached, without even a menace, while they were out of our reach, was an indication of uncommon tamene&s;s and timidity, &s;uch as tho&s;e who had only been occa&s;ionally warriors mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed to have &s;haken off, whatever might have been their natural di&s;po&s;ition. I have faithfully related facts, the reader mu&s;t judge of the people for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From the account that has been given of our commerce with them, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that we &s;hould know much of their language; yet as this is an object of great curio&s;ity, e&s;|pecially to the learned, and of great importance in their re|&s;earches into the origin of the various nations that have been di&s;covered, we took &s;ome pains to bring away &s;uch a &s;pecimen of it as might, in a certain degree, an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, and I &s;hall now give an account how it was procured. If we want|ed to know the name of a &s;tone, we took a &s;tone up into our hands, and as well as we could, intimated by &s;igns that we wi&s;hed they &s;hould name it: the word that they pronounced upon the occa&s;ion, we immediately wrote down. This me|thod, though it was the be&s;t we could contrive, might cer|tainly lead us into many mi&s;takes; for if an Indian was to take up a &s;tone, and a&s;k us the name of it, we might an&s;wer a pebble or a flint; &s;o when we took up a &s;tone, and a&s;ked an Indian the name of it, he might pronounce a word that di&s;|tingui&s;hed the &s;pecies and not the genus, or that, in&s;tead of &s;ignifying &s;tone &s;imply, might &s;ignify a rough &s;tone, or a &s;mooth &s;tone; however, as much as po&s;&s;ible to avoid mi&s;takes of this kind, &s;everal of us contrived, at different times, to get from them as many words as we could, and having noted them down, compared our li&s;ts: tho&s;e which were the &s;ame in and which, according to every one's account, &s;ignified the &s;ame thing, we ventured to record, with a very few others, which, from the &s;implicity of the &s;ubject, and the ea&s;e of expre&s;&s;ing our que&s;tion with plainne&s;s and preci&s;ion by a &s;ign, have acquired equal authority.</P>

<P>I &s;hall now quit this country, with a few ob&s;ervations re|lative to the currents and tides upon the coa&s;t. From lati|tude 32&deg;, and &s;omewhat higher, down to Sandy Cape, in latitude 24&deg; 46&prime;, we con&s;tantly found a current &s;etting to the &s;outhward, at the rate of about ten or fifteen miles a day, being more or le&s;s, according to our di&s;tance from the land, for it always ran with more force in &s;hore than in the offing; but I could never &s;atisfy my&s;elf whether the flood-tide came from the &s;outhward, the ea&s;tward, or the northward: I in|clined to the opinion that it came from the &s;outh-ea&s;t, but the fir&s;t time we anchored off the coa&s;t, which was in latitude 24&deg; 30&prime;, about ten leagues to the &s;outh ea&s;t of Bu&s;tard Bay, I found it come from the north we&s;t; on the contrary, thirty leagues farther to the north we&s;t, on the &s;outh &s;ide of Keppel Bay, I found that it came from the ea&s;t, and at the northern part of that bay it came from the northward, but with a much &s;lower motion than it had come from the ea&s;t: on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Bay of Inlets, it &s;et &s;trongly to the we&s;tward, as far as the opening of Broad Sound; but on the north &s;ide of that &s;ound, it came with a very &s;low motion from the north we&s;t; and when we lay at anchor before Repul&s;e Bay, it came from the northward: to account for its cour&s;e in all this variety of directions, we need only admit that the flood-tide comes from the ea&s;t or &s;outh ea&s;t. It is well-known, that where there are deep inlets, and large creeks into low lands, running up from the &s;ea, and not occa&s;ioned by rivers of fre&s;h water, there will always be a great indraught of the flood-tide, the direction of which will be determined by the po&s;ition or di|rection of the coa&s;t which forms the entrance of &s;uch inlet, whatever be its cour&s;e at &s;ea; and where the tides are weak, which upon this coa&s;t is generally the ca&s;e, a large inlet will, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, attract the flood-tide for many leagues.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="013324_0443_0F90F240431F31C0">
To the the northward of Whit&s;unday's Pa&s;&s;age there is no large inlet, con&s;equently the flood &s;ets to the northward, or north we&s;tward, according to the direction of the coa&s;t, and the ebb to the &s;outh, or &s;outh ea&s;tward, at lea&s;t &s;uch is their cour&s;e at a little di&s;tance from the land, for very near it they will be influenced by &s;mall inlets. I al&s;o ob&s;erved, that we had only one high tide in twenty-four hours, which happen|ed in the night. The difference between the perpendicular ri&s;e of the water in the day and the night, when there is a &s;pring-tide, is no le&s;s than three feet, which, where the tides are &s;o incon&s;iderable as they are here, is a great proportion of the whole difference between high and low water. This ir|regularity of the tides, which is worthy of notice, we did not di&s;cover till we were run a&s;hore, and perhaps farther to the northward it is &s;till greater: after we got within the reef the &s;econd time, we found the tides more con&s;iderable than we had ever done before, except in the Bay of Inlets, and po&s;|&s;ibly this may be owing to the water being more confined be|tween the &s;hoals; here al&s;o the flood &s;ets to the north we&s;t, and continues in the &s;ame direction to the extremity of New Wales, from whence its direction is we&s;t, and &s;outh we&s;t, into the Indian &s;ea.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. The Pa&s;&s;age from New South Wales to New Guinea, with an Account of what happened upon Landing there.</HEAD>
<P>IN the afternoon of Thur&s;day Augu&s;t the 23d, after leaving Booby I&s;land, we &s;teered W. N. W. with light airs from the S. S. W. till five o'clock, when it fell calm, and the tide of ebb &s;oon after &s;etting to the N. E. we came to an anchor in eight fathom water, with a &s;oft &s;andy bottom. Booby I&s;land bore S. 50 E. di&s;tant five miles, and the Prince of Wales's I&s;les extended from the N. E. by N. to S. 55 E.; between the&s;e there appeared to be a clear open pa&s;&s;age, extending from N. 46 E. to E. by N.</P>
<P>At half an hour after five, in the morning of the 24th, as we were purcha&s;ing the anchor, the cable parted at about eight or ten fathom from the ring: the &s;hip then began to drive, but I immediately dropped another anchor, which brought her up before &s;he got more than a cable's length from the buoy; the boats were then &s;ent to &s;weep for the anchor, but could not &s;ucceed. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 10&deg; 30&prime; S. As I was re&s;olved not to leave the anchor be|hind, while their remained a po&s;&s;ibility of recovering it, I &s;ent

the boats again after dinner, with a &s;mall line, to di&s;cover where it lay; this being happily effected, we &s;wept for it with a haw&s;er, and by the &s;ame haw&s;er hove the &s;hip up to it: we proceeded to weigh it, but ju&s;t as we were about to &s;hip it, the haw&s;er &s;lipped, and we had all our labour to repeat: by this time it was dark, and we were obliged to &s;u&s;pend our operations till the morning.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was light, we &s;weeped it again, and heaved it to the bows: by eight o'clock, we weighed the other an|chor, got under &s;ail, and, with a fine breeze at E. N. E. &s;tood to the north we&s;t. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;erva|tion, was 10&deg; 18&prime; S. longitude 219&deg; 39&prime; W. At this time, we had no land in &s;ight, but about two miles to the &s;outhward of us lay a large &s;hoal, upon which the &s;ea broke with great violence, and part of which, I believe, is dry at low water, It extends N. W. and S. E. and is about five leagues in cir|cuit. Our depth of water, from the time we weighed till now, was nine fathom, but it &s;oon &s;hallowed to &s;even fathom; and at half an hour after one, having run eleven miles between noon and that time, the boat which was a-head made the &s;ignal for &s;hoal water; we immediately let go an anchor, and brought the &s;hip up with all her &s;ails &s;tanding, for the boat having ju&s;t been relieved, was at but a little di&s;tance: upon looking out from the &s;hip, we &s;aw &s;hoal water almo&s;t all round us, both wind and tide at the &s;ame time &s;etting upon it. The &s;hip was in &s;ix fathom, but upon &s;ounding round her, at the di&s;tance of half a cable's length, we found &s;carce|ly two. This &s;hoal reached from the ea&s;t, round by the north and we&s;t, as far as the &s;outh we&s;t, &s;o that there was no way for us to get clear, but that which we came. This was an|other hair's-breadth e&s;cape, for it was near high water, and there run a &s;hort cockling &s;ea, which mu&s;t very &s;oon have bulged the &s;hip if &s;he had &s;truck; and if her direction had been half a cable's length more either to the right or left, &s;he mu&s;t have &s;truck before the &s;ignal for the &s;hoal was made. The &s;hoals which, like the&s;e, lie a fathom or two under wa|ter, are the mo&s;t dangerous of any, for they do not di&s;cover them&s;elves till the ve&s;&s;el is ju&s;t upon them, and then indeed the water looks brown, as if it reflected a dark cloud. Be|tween three and four o'clock the tide of ebb began to make, and I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter to &s;ound to the &s;outhward and &s;outh-we&s;tward, and in the mean time, as the &s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, I weigh|ed anchor, and with a little &s;ail &s;tood fir&s;t to the &s;outhward, and afterwards edging away to the we&s;tward, got once more out of danger. At &s;un&s;et we anchored in ten fathom, with a &s;andy bottom, having a fre&s;h gale at E. S. E.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning we weighed again and &s;tood we&s;t, having, as u&s;ual, fir&s;t &s;ent a boat ahead to &s;ound. I had in|tended
<PB N="156" REF="013324_0445_0F90F241B2761B28">
to &s;teer N. W. till I had made the &s;outh coa&s;t of New Guinea, de&s;igning, if po&s;&s;ible, to touch upon it; but upon meeting with the&s;e &s;hoals, I altered my cour&s;e, in hopes of finding a clearer channel, and deeper water. In this I &s;uc|ceeded, for by noon our depth of water was gradually in|crea&s;ed to &s;eventeen fathom. Our latitude was now by ob&s;er|vation 10&deg; 10&prime; S.; and our longitude 220&deg; 12&prime; W. No land was in &s;ight. We continued to &s;teer we&s;t till &s;un-&s;et, our depth of water being from twenty-&s;even to twenty-three fa|thom: we then &s;hortened fail, and kept upon a wind all night: four hours on one tack, and four on another. At day-light, we made all the &s;ail we could, and &s;teered W. N. W. till eight o'clock, and then N. W. At noon, our lati|tude by ob&s;ervation was 9&deg; 56&prime; S.; longitude 221&deg; W.; va|riation 2&deg; 30&prime; E. We continued our N. W. cour&s;e till &s;un&s;et, when we again &s;hortened &s;ail, and hauled clo&s;e upon a wind to the northward: our depth of water was twenty-one fathom. At eight, we tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outhward till twelve; then &s;tood to the northward with little &s;ail till day-light: our &s;oundings were from twenty-five to &s;eventeen fathom, the water growing gradually &s;hallow as we &s;tood to the north|ward. At this time we made &s;ail and &s;tood to the north, in order to make the land of New Guinea: from the time of our making &s;ail till noon, the depth of water gradually decrea&s;|ed from &s;eventeen to twelve fathom, with a &s;toney and &s;helly bottom. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation was now 8&deg; 52&prime; S. which is in the &s;ame parallel as that in which the &s;outhern parts of New Guinea are laid down in the charts; but there are only two points &s;o far to the &s;outh, and I reckoned that we were a degree to the we&s;tward of them both, and therefore did not &s;ee the land which trends more to the northward. We found the &s;ea here to be in many parts covered with a brown &s;cum, &s;uch as &s;ailors generally call &s;pawn. When I fir&s;t &s;aw it, I was alarmed, fearing that we were among &s;hoals; but upon &s;ounding, we found the &s;ame depth of water as in other places. This &s;cum was examined both by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, but they could not determine what it was: it was formed of innumerable &s;mall particles, not more than half a line in length, each of which in the micro&s;cope appear|ed to con&s;i&s;t of thirty or forty tubes; and each tube was di|vided through its whole length by &s;mall partitions into many cells, like the tubes of the conferva: they were &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to the vegetable kingdom, becau&s;e upon burning them they produced no &s;mell like that of an animal &s;ub&s;tance. The &s;ame appearance had been ob&s;erved upon the coa&s;t of Brazil and New Holland, but never at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore. In the evening a &s;mall bird hovered about the &s;hip, and at night, &s;ettling among the rigging, was taken,
<PB N="157" REF="013324_0446_0F90F24274B38FD8">
It proved to be exactly the &s;ame bird which Dampier has de&s;|cribed, and of which he has given a rude figure, by the name of a Noddy from New Holland. [See his Voyages, vol. iii. p. 98. Tab. of Birds, Fig. 5.]</P>
<P>We continued &s;tanding to the northward with a fre&s;h gale at E. by E. and S. E. till &s;ix in the evening, having very irregular &s;oundings, the depth changing at once from twenty-four fathom to &s;even. At four, we had &s;een the land from the ma&s;t|head, bearing N. W. by N.; it appeared to be very low, and to &s;tretch from W. N. W. to N. N. E. di&s;tant four or five leagues. We now hauled clo&s;e upon a wind till &s;even, then tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outhward till twelve, at which time we wore and &s;tood to the northward till four in the morning, then laid the head of the ve&s;&s;el off till day-light, when we again &s;aw the land, and &s;tood in N. N. W. directly for it, with a fre&s;h gale at E. by S. Our &s;oundings during the night were very irregular from &s;even to five fathom, &s;uddenly chang|ing from deep to &s;hallow, and from &s;hallow to deep, without in the lea&s;t corre&s;ponding with our di&s;tance from the land. At half an hour after &s;ix in the morning a &s;mall low i&s;land which lay at the di&s;tance of about a league from the main, bore N. by W. di&s;tant five miles: this i&s;land lies in latitude 8&deg; 13&prime; S. longitude 221&deg; 25&prime; W.; and I find it laid down in the chart by the names of Bartholomew and Whermoy&s;en. We now &s;teered N. W. by W. W. N. W. W. by N. W. by S. and S. W. by W. as we found the land lie, with from 5 to 9 fathom, and though we reckoned we were not more than four leagues from it, yet it was &s;o low and level that we could but ju&s;t &s;ee it from the deck. It appeared however to be well covered with wood, and among other trees, we thought we could di&s;tingui&s;h the cocoa-nut. We &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places, and therefore knew there were inhabitants. At noon we were about three leagues from the land; the we&s;termo&s;t part of which that was in &s;ight bore S. 79&deg; W. Our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 8&deg; 19&prime; S. and longitude 221&deg; 44&prime; W. The i&s;land of St. Bartholo|mew bore N. 74 E. di&s;tant 20 miles.</P>
<P>After &s;teering S. W. by W. &s;ix miles, we had &s;hoal water on our &s;tarboard bow, which I &s;ent the yawl to found, and at the &s;ame time hauled off upon a wind till four o'clock, and though during that time we had run &s;ix miles, we had not deepened our water an inch. I then edged away S. W. four miles more; but finding it &s;till &s;hoal water, I brought to and called the boats aboard. At this time, being between three and four leagues from the &s;hore, and the yawl having found only three fathom water in the place to which I had &s;ent her to &s;ound, I hauled off clo&s;e upon a wind, and weathered the &s;hoal about half a mile.</P>
<P>Between one and two o'clock, we pa&s;&s;ed a bay or inlet be|fore
<PB N="158" REF="013324_0447_0F90F24350C13EE0">
which lies a &s;mall i&s;land that &s;eems to &s;helter it from the &s;outherly winds; but I very much doubt whether there is &s;uf|ficient depth of water behind it for &s;hipping. I could not attempt to determine the que&s;tion, becau&s;e the S. E, trade wind blows right into the bay, and we had not as yet had any breeze from the land.</P>
<P>We &s;tretched off to &s;ea till twelve o'clock, when we were about eleven leagues from the land, and had deepened our water to twenty-nine fathom. We now tacked and &s;tood in till five in the morning; when, being in &s;ix fathom and an half, we tacked and laid the head of the ve&s;&s;el off till day-light, when we &s;aw the land, bearing N. W. by W. at about the di&s;tance of four leagues. We now made &s;ail, and &s;teered fir&s;t W. S. W. then W. by S.; but coming into five fathom and an a half, we hauled off S. W. till we deepened our water to eight fathom, and then kept away W. by S. and W. having nine fathom, and the land ju&s;t in &s;ight from the deck; we judged it to be about four leagues di&s;tant, and it was &s;till very low and woody. Great quantities of the brown &s;cum continued to appear upon the water, and the &s;ailors, having given up the notion of its being &s;wamp, found a new name for it, and called it Sea-&s;aw-du&s;t. At noon, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 8&deg; 30&prime; S.; our longitude 222&deg; 34&prime; W.; and Saint Bartholomew's i&s;le bore N. 69 E. di&s;tant &s;eventy-four miles.</P>
<P>As all this coa&s;t appears to have been very minutely examined by the Dutch, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that we continued our cour&s;e to the northward with very &s;hallow water, upon a bank of mud, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the &s;hore as that it could &s;carcely be &s;een from the &s;hip, till the 3d of September. During this time we made many attempts to get near enough to go on &s;hore, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and having now lo&s;t &s;ix days of fair wind, at a time when we knew the &s;outh ea&s;t mon&s;oon to be nearly at an end, we began to be impatient of farther delay, and deter|mined to run the &s;hip in as near to the &s;hore as po&s;&s;ible, and then land with the pinnace, while &s;he kept plying off and on, to examine the produce of the country, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants. For the two la&s;t days we had early in the morn|ing a light breeze from the &s;hore, which was &s;trongly impreg|nated with the fragrance of the trees, &s;hrubs, and herbage, that covered it, the &s;mell being &s;omething like that of Gum Benjamin. On the 3d of September, at day-break, we &s;aw the land extending from N. by E. to S. E. at about four leagues di&s;tance, and we then kept &s;tanding in for it with a fre&s;h gale at E. S. E. and E. by S. till nine o'clock, when being within about three or four miles of it, and in three fathom water, we brought to. The pinnace being hoi&s;ted out, I &s;et off from the &s;hip with the boat's crew, accompanied by Mr. Banks, who al&s;o took his &s;ervants, and Dr. Solander, being in all twelve

per&s;ons well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; we rowed directly towards to the &s;hore, but the water was &s;o &s;hallow that we could not reach it by about two hundred yards: we waded however the re&s;t of the way, having left two of the &s;eamen to take care of the boat. Hitherto we had &s;een no &s;igns of inhabitants at this place; but as &s;oon as we got a&s;hore we di&s;covered the prints of human feet, which could not long have been impre&s;&s;ed upon the &s;and, as they were below high-water mark: we therefore concluded that the people were at no great di&s;tance, and, as a thick wood came down within a hundred yards of the water, we thought it nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with caution, le&s;t we &s;hould fall into an ambu&s;cade and our retreat to the boat be cut off. We walked along the &s;kirts of the wood, and at the di&s;tance of about two hundred yards from the place where we landed, we came to a grove of cocoa-nut trees, which &s;tood upon the banks of a little brook of bracki&s;h water. The trees were of a &s;mall growth, but well hung with fruit; and near them was a &s;hed or hut, which had been covered with their leaves, though mo&s;t of them were now fallen off: about the hut lay a great number of the &s;hells of the fruit, &s;ome of which appeared to be ju&s;t fre&s;h from the tree. We looked at the fruit very wi&s;hfully, but not think|ing it &s;afe to climb, we were obliged to leave it without ta&s;ting a &s;ingle nut. At a little di&s;tance from this place we found plan|tains, and a bread-fruit tree, but it had nothing upon it; and having now advanced about a quarter of a mile from the boat, three Indians ru&s;hed out of the wood with a hideous &s;hout, at about the di&s;tance of a hundred yards; and as they ran towards us, the foremo&s;t threw &s;omething out of his hand, which flew on one &s;ide of him, and burnt exactly like gunpowder, but made no report: the other two in&s;tantly threw their lances at us; and, as no time was now to be lo&s;t, we di&s;charged our pieces, which were loaded with &s;mall &s;hot. It is probable that they did not feel the &s;hot, for though they halted a moment, they did not retreat; and a third dart was thrown at us. As we thought their farther approach might be prevented with le&s;s ri&s;k of life, than it would co&s;t to defend our&s;elves again&s;t their attack if they &s;hould come nearer, we loaded our pieces with ball, and fired a &s;econd time: by this di&s;charge it is probable that &s;ome of them were wounded; yet we had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee that they all ran away with great agility. As I was not di&s;po&s;ed forcibly to invade this country, either to gratify our appetites or our curio&s;ity, and perceived that nothing was to be done upon friendly terms, we improved this interval, in which the de&s;truction of the natives was no longer nece&s;&s;ary to our own defence, and with all expedition returned towards our boat. As we were advancing along the &s;hore, we perceived that the two men on board made &s;ignals that more Indians were
<PB N="160" REF="013324_0449_0F9050132F0D6518">
coming down; and before we got into the water we &s;aw &s;everal of them coming round a point at the di&s;tance of about five hundred yards; it is probable that they had met with the three who fir&s;t attacked us; for as &s;oon as they &s;aw us they halted, and &s;eemed to wait till their main body &s;hould come up. We entered the water, and waded towards the boat; and they re|mained at their &s;tation, without giving us any interruption. As &s;oon as we were aboard we rowed abrea&s;t of them, and their number then appeared to be between &s;ixty and a hundred. We now took a view of them at our lei&s;ure; they made much the &s;ame appearance as the New Hollanders, being nearly of the &s;ame &s;tature, and having their hair &s;hort cropped: like them al&s;o they were all &s;tark naked, but we thought the colour of their &s;kin was not quite &s;o dark; this however might perhaps be merely the effect of their not being quite &s;o dirty. All this while they were &s;houting defiance, and letting off their fires by four or five at a time. What the&s;e fires were, or for what pur|po&s;e intended, we could not imagine: tho&s;e who di&s;charged them had in their hands a &s;hort piece of &s;tick, po&s;&s;ibly a hollow cane, which they &s;wung &s;ideways from them, and we imme|diately &s;aw fire and &s;moke, exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e of a mu&s;|quet, and of no longer duration. This wonderful phaenomenon was ob&s;erved from the &s;hip, and the deception was &s;o great that the people on board thought they had fire-arms; and in the boat, if we had not been &s;o near as that we mu&s;t have heard the report, we &s;hould have thought they had been firing volleys. After we had looked at them attentively &s;ome time, without taking any notice of their fla&s;hing and vociferation, we fired &s;ome mu&s;quets over their heads: upon hearing the balls rattle among the trees, they walked lei&s;urely away, and we returned to the &s;hip. Upon examining the weapons they had thrown at us, we found them to be light darts, about four feet long, very ill made, of a reed or bamboo cane, and pointed with hard wood, in which there were many barbs. They were di&s;charged with great force; for though we were at &s;ixty yards di&s;tance, they went beyond us, but in what manner we could not exactly &s;ee: po&s;&s;ibly they might be &s;hot with a bow; but we &s;aw no bows among them when we &s;urveyed them from the boat, and we were in general of opinion that they were thrown with a &s;tick, in the manner practi&s;ed by the New Hollanders.</P>
<P>This place lies in the latitude of 6&deg; 15&prime; S. and about &s;ixty-five leagues to the N. E. of Port Saint Augu&s;tine, or Walche Caep, and is near what is called C. de la Colta de St. Bonaventura. The land here, like that in every other part of the coa&s;t is very low, but covered with a luxuriance of wood and herbage that can &s;carcely be conceived. We &s;aw the cocoa-nut, the bread-fruit, and the plantain tree, all flouri&s;h|ting in a &s;tate of the highe&s;t perfection, though the cocoa-nuts
<PB N="161" REF="013324_0450_0F90EC996EF08678">
were green, and the bread-fruit not in &s;ea&s;on; be&s;ides mo&s;t of the trees, &s;hrubs, and plants that are common to the South Sea i&s;lands, New Zealand, and New Holland.</P>
<P>Soon after our return to the &s;hip, we hoi&s;ted in the boat and made &s;ail to the we&s;tward, being re&s;olved to &s;pend no more time upon this coa&s;t, to the great &s;atisfaction of a very con|&s;iderable majority of the &s;hip's company. But I am &s;orry to &s;ay that I was &s;trongly urged by &s;ome of the officers to &s;end a party of men a&s;hore, and cut down the cocoa-nut trees for the &s;ake of the fruit. This I peremptorily refu&s;ed, as equally un|ju&s;t and cruel. The natives had attacked us merely for landing upon their coa&s;t, when we attempted to take nothing away, and it was therefore morally certain that they would have made a vigorous effort to defend their property if it had been invaded, in which ca&s;e many of them mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice to our attempt, and perhaps al&s;o &s;ome of our own people. I &s;hould have regretted the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, if I had been in want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and certainly it would have been highly criminal when nothing was to be obtained but two or three hundred of green cocoa-nuts, which would at mo&s;t have procured us a mere tran&s;ient gratification. I might indeed have proceeded farther along the coa&s;t to the northward and we&s;tward, in &s;earch of a place where the &s;hip might have lain &s;o near the &s;hore as to cover the people with her guns when they landed; but this would have obviated only part of the mi&s;chief, and though it might have &s;ecured us, it would probab|ly in the very act have been fatal to the natives. Be&s;ides, we had rea&s;on to think that before &s;uch a place would have been found, we &s;hould have been carried &s;o far to the we&s;tward as to have been obliged to go to Batavia, on the north &s;ide of Java; which I did not think &s;o &s;afe a pa&s;&s;age as to the &s;outh of Java, through the Streights of Sunday: the &s;hip al&s;o was &s;o leaky that I doubted whether it would not be nece&s;&s;ary to heave her down at Batavia, which was another rea&s;on for making the be&s;t of our way to that place; e&s;pecially as no di&s;covery could be expected in &s;eas which had already been navigated, and where every coa&s;t had been laid down by the Dutch geographers. The Spaniards indeed, as well as the Dutch, &s;eem to have circum-navigated all the i&s;lands in New Guinea, as almo&s;t every place that is di&s;tingui&s;hed in the chart has a name in both lang|uages. The charts with which I compared &s;uch part of this coa&s;t as I vi&s;ited, are bound up with a French work, intitled, "Hi&s;toire des Navigationes aux Terres Au&s;trales," which was publi&s;hed in 1756, and I found them tolerably exact; yet I know not by whom, nor when they were taken: and though New Holland and New Guinea are in them repre&s;ented as two di&s;tinct countries, the very hi&s;tory in which they are bound up, leaves it in doubt. I pretend however to no more merit
<PB N="162" REF="013324_0451_0F90F244B0983368">
in this part of the voyage, than to have e&s;tabli&s;hed the fact beyond all controver&s;y.</P>
<P>As the two countries lie very near each other, and the inter|mediate &s;pace is full of i&s;lands, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that they were both peopled from one common &s;tock: yet no intercour&s;e appears to have been kept up between them; for if there had, the cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, plantains, &amp; other fruits of New Guinea, which are equally nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of life, would cer|tainly have been tran&s;planted to New Holland, whare no traces of them are to be found. The Author of the "Hi&s;toire des Navigationes aux Terres Au&s;trales," in his account of La Maire's voyage, has given a vocabulary of the language that is &s;poken in an i&s;land near New Britain, and we find, by com|paring that vocabulary with the words which we learnt in New Holland, that the languages are not the &s;ame. If therefore it &s;hould appear, that the languages of New Britain and New Guinea are the &s;ame, there will be rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that New Britain and New Guinea were peopled from a common &s;tock; but that the inhabitants of New Holland had a different origin, notwith&s;tanding the proximity of the countries.</P>

<P>WE made &s;ail, from noon on Monday the 3d to noon on Tue&s;day the 4th, &s;tanding to the we&s;tward, and all the time kept in &s;oundings, having from fourteen to thirty fathom; not regular, but &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s.

and foul ground. The&s;e i&s;lands have no place in the charts except they are the Arrou i&s;lands; and if the&s;e, they are laid down much too far from New Guinea. I found the &s;outh part of them to lie in latitude 7&deg; 6&prime; S., longitude 225&deg; W.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;teer W. S. W. at the rate of four miles and an half an hour, till ten o'clock at night, when we had forty-two fathom, at eleven we thirty-&s;even, at twelve forty-five, at one in the morning forty-nine, and at three 120, after which we had no ground. At day-light, we made all the &s;ail we could, and at ten o'clock, &s;aw land, extending from N. N. W. to W. by N. di&s;tant between five and &s;ix leagues: at noon, it bore from N. to W. and at about the &s;ame di&s;tance: it ap|peared to be level, and of a moderate height: by our di&s;tance from New Guinea, it ought to have been part of the Arrou I&s;lands, but it lies a degree farther to the &s;outh than any of the&s;e i&s;lands are laid down in the charts; and by the latitude &s;hould be Timor Laoet: we &s;ounded, but had no ground with fifty fathom.</P>
<P>As I was not able to &s;atisfy my&s;elf from any chart, what land it was that I &s;aw to leeward, and fearing that it might trend away more &s;outherly, the weather al&s;o being &s;o hazy that we could not &s;ee far, I &s;teered S. W. and by four had lo&s;t &s;ight of the i&s;land. I was now &s;ure that no part of it lay to the &s;outhward of 8&deg; 15&prime; S. and continued &s;tanding to the S. W. with an ea&s;y &s;ail, and a fre&s;h breeze at S. E. by E. and E. S. E.: we &s;ounded every hour, but had no bottom with 120 fathom.</P>
<P>At day-break in the morning, we &s;teered W. S. W. and after|wards W. by S. which by noon brought us into the latitude of 9&deg; 30&prime; S. longitude 229&deg; 34&prime; W. and by our run from New Guinea, we ought to have been within &s;ight of Wea&s;el I&s;les, which in the charts are laid down at the di&s;tance of twenty or twenty-five leagues from the coa&s;t of New Holland; we how|ever &s;aw nothing, and therefore they mu&s;t have been placed erroneou&s;ly; nor can this be thought &s;trange, when it is con|&s;idered that not only the&s;e i&s;lands, but the coa&s;t which bounds this &s;ea, have been di&s;covered and explored by different people, and at different times, and the charts upon which they are de|lineated, put together by others, perhaps at the di&s;tance of more than a century after the di&s;coveries had been made; not to mention that the di&s;coverers them&s;elves had not all the re|qui&s;ites for keeping an accurate journal, of which tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent age are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>We continued onr cour&s;e, &s;teering W. till the evening of the 8th, when the variation of the compa&s;s, by &s;everal azi|muths, was 12&prime; W. and by the amplitude 5&prime; W. At noon, on the 9th, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 9&deg; 46&prime; S., longitude 232&deg; 7&prime; W. For the la&s;t two days we had &s;teered due W. yet, by ob&s;ervation, we made &s;ixteen miles &s;outhing, &s;ix miles from

noon on the 6th to noon on the 7th, and ten miles from noon on the 7th to noon on the 8th, by which it appeared that there was a current &s;etting to the &s;outhward. At &s;un&s;et, we found the variation to be 2 W. and at the &s;ame time, &s;aw an appear|ance of very high land bearing N. W.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 10th, we &s;aw clearly that what had appeared to be land the night before, was Timor. At noon, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 10&deg; 1&prime; S. which was fifteen miles to the &s;outhward of that given by the log; our longitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 233&deg; 27&prime; W. We &s;teered N. W. in order to obtain a more di&s;tinct view of the land in &s;ight, till four o'clock in the morning of the 11th, when the wind came to the N. W. and W. with which we &s;tood to the &s;outhward till nine, when we tacked and &s;tood N. W. having the wind now at W. S. W. At &s;un-ri&s;e, the land had appeared to extend from W. N. W. to N. E. and at noon, we could &s;ee it extend to the we&s;tward as far as W. by S. &frac12; S. but no farther to the ea&s;tward than N. by E. We were now well a&s;&s;ured, that as the fir&s;t land we had &s;een was Timor, the la&s;t i&s;land we had pa&s;&s;ed was Timor Laoet, or Laut. Laoet, is a word in the language of Malaca, &s;ignifying Sea, and this i&s;land was named by the inhabitants of that country. The &s;outh part of it lies in latitude 8&deg; 15&prime; S. longitude 228&deg; 10&prime; W. but in the charts the &s;outh point is laid down in various latitudes, from 8&deg; 30&prime; to 9&deg; 30&prime;: it is indeed po&s;&s;ible that the land we &s;aw might be &s;ome other i&s;land, but the pre&s;umption to the contrary is very &s;trong, for if Timor Laut had lain where it is placed in the charts, we mu&s;t have &s;een it there. We were now in latitude 9&deg; 37&prime; S., longitude, by an ob&s;ervation of the &s;un and moon, 233&deg; 54&prime; W. we were the day before in 233&deg; 27&prime;; the difference is 27, exactly the &s;ame that was given by the log: this, however, is a degree of accuracy in ob&s;ervation that is &s;eldom to be expected. In the afternoon, we &s;tood in &s;hore till eight in the evening, when we tacked and &s;tood off, being at the di&s;tance of about three leagues from the land, which at &s;un-&s;et extended from S. W. &frac12; W. to N. E.: at this time we &s;ounded, and had no ground with 140 fathom. At midnight, having but little wind, we tacked and &s;tood in, and at noon the next day, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 9&deg; 36&prime; S. This day, we &s;aw &s;moke on &s;hore in &s;everal places, and had &s;een many fires during the night. The land appeared to be very high, ri&s;ing in gradual &s;lopes one above another: the hills were in general covered with thick woods, but among them we could di&s;tingui&s;h naked &s;pots of a con&s;iderable extent, which had the appearance of having been cleared by art. At five o'clock in the afternoon, we were within a mile and an half of the &s;hore, in &s;ixteen fathom water, and abrea&s;t of a &s;mall inlet into the low land, which lies in latitude 9&deg; 34&prime; S. and probably is the &s;ame that

Dampier entered with his boat, for it did not &s;eem to have &s;uf|ficient depth of water for a &s;hip. The land here an&s;wered well to the de&s;cription that he has given of it: clo&s;e to the beach it was covered with high &s;piry trees, which he mentions as hav|ing the appearance of pines; behind the&s;e there &s;eemed to be &s;alt water creeks, and many mangroves, inter&s;per&s;ed however with cocoa-nut trees: the flat land at the beach appeared in &s;ome places to extend inward two or three miles before the ri&s;e of the fir&s;t hill; in this part, however, we &s;aw no appearance of plantations or hou&s;es, but great fertility, and from the number of fires, we judged that the place mu&s;t be well peopled.</P>
<P>When we had approached within a mile and an half of the &s;hore, we tacked and &s;tood off, and the extreams of the coa&s;t then extended from N. E. by E. to W. by S. &frac12; S. The &s;outh we&s;terly extremity was a low point, di&s;tant from us about three leagues. While we were &s;tanding in for the &s;hore, we &s;ounded &s;everal times, but had no ground till we came within about two miles and a half, and then we had five and twenty fathom, with a &s;oft bottom. After we had tacked, we &s;tood off till midnight, with the wind at S.; we then tacked and &s;tood two hours to the we&s;tward, when the wind veered to S. W. and W. S. W. and we then &s;tood to the &s;outhward again. In the morning, we found the variation to be 1&deg; 10&prime; W. by the amplitude, and by the azimuth 1&deg; 27&prime;. At noon, our latitude was, by ob&s;er|vation, 9&deg; 45&prime; S. our longitude 234&deg; 12&prime; W.; we were then about &s;even leagues di&s;tant from the land, which extended from N. 31 E. to W. S. W. &frac12; W.</P>
<P>With light land breezes from W. by N. for a few hours in a morning, and &s;ea breezes from S. S. W. and S. we advanced to the we&s;tward but &s;lowly. At noon on the 14th, we were between &s;ix and &s;even leagues from the land, which extended from N. by E. to S. 78 W.; we &s;till &s;aw &s;moke in many places by day, and fire by night, both upon the low land and the mountains beyond it. We continued &s;teering along the &s;hore, till the morning of the 15th, the land &s;till appearing hilly, but not &s;o high as it had been: the hills in general came quite down to the &s;ea, and where they did not, we &s;aw in&s;tead of flats and mangrove land, immen&s;e groves of cocoa-nut trees, reaching about a mile up from the beach: there the plantations and hou&s;es commenced, and appeared to be innumerable. The hou&s;es were &s;haded by groves of the fan palm, or <HI>bora&s;&s;us,</HI> and the plantations, which were inclo&s;ed by a fence, reached almo&s;t to the tops of the highe&s;t hills. We &s;aw however neither people nor cattle, though our gla&s;&s;es were continually employed, at which we were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>We continued our cour&s;e, with little variation, till nine o'clock in the morning of the 16th, when we &s;aw the &s;mall i&s;land called ROTTE; and at noon, the i&s;land SEMAU, lying off the &s;outh end of Timor, bore N. W.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="013324_0455_0F90F24D1287A318">
Dampier, who has given a large de&s;cription of the i&s;land of Timor, &s;ays, that it is &s;eventy leagues long, and &s;ixteen broad, and that it lies nearly N. E. and S. W. I found the ea&s;t &s;ide of it to lie neare&s;t N. E. by E. and S. W. by W. and the &s;outh end to lie in latitude 10&deg; 23&prime; S. longitude 236&deg; 5&prime; W. We ran about forty-five leagues along the ea&s;t &s;ide, and found the navigation altogether free from danger. The land which is bounded by the &s;ea, except near the &s;outh end, is low for two or three miles within the beach, and in general inter&s;ected by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lt creeks: behind the low land are mountains, which ri&s;e one above another to a con&s;iderable height. We &s;teered W. N. W. till two in the afternoon, when, being within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the north end of Rotte, we hauled up N. N. W. in order to go between it and Semau: after &s;teering three leagues upon this cour&s;e, we edged away N. W. and W. and by &s;ix we were clear of all the i&s;lands. At this time, the &s;outh part of Semau, which lies in latitude 10&deg; 15&prime; S. bore N. E. di&s;tant four leagues, and the i&s;land of Rotte extended as far to the &s;outhward as S. 36 W. The north end of this i&s;land, and the &s;outh end of Timor, lie N. &frac12; E. and S. &frac12; W. and are about three or four leagues di&s;tant from each other. At the we&s;t end of the pa&s;&s;age between Rotte and Semau, are two &s;mall i&s;lands, one of which lies near the Rotte &s;hore, and the other off the &s;outh we&s;t point of Semau: there is a good channel between them, about &s;ix miles broad, through which we pa&s;&s;ed. The i&s;le of Rotte has not &s;o lofty and mountainous an appear|ance as Timor, though it is agreeably diver&s;ified by hill and valley: on the north &s;ide, there are many &s;andy beaches, near which grew &s;ome trees of the fan palm, but the far greater part was covered with a kind of bru&s;hy wood, that was with|out leaves. The appearance of Semau was nearly the &s;ame with that of Timor, but not quite &s;o high. About ten o'clock at night, we ob&s;erved a phaenomenon in the heavens, which in many particulars re&s;embled the aurora borealis, and in others was very different: it con&s;i&s;ted of a dull reddi&s;h light, and reached about twenty degrees above the horizon: its ex|tent was very different at different times, but it was never le&s;s than eight or ten points of the compa&s;s: through, and out of this, pa&s;&s;ed rays of light of a brighter colour, which vani&s;hed, and were renewed nearly in the &s;ame time as tho&s;e of the auro|ra borealis, but had no degree of the tremulous or vibratory motion which is ob&s;erved in that phaenomenon: the body of it bore S. S. E. from the &s;hip, and it continued, without any diminution of its brightne&s;s, till twelve o'clock, when we retired to &s;leep, but how long afterwards, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Being clear of all the i&s;lands, which are laid down in the maps we had on board, between Timor and Java, we &s;teered a we&s;t cour&s;e till &s;ix o'clock the next morning, when we
<PB N="167" REF="013324_0456_0F90501352200F78">
unexpectedly &s;aw an i&s;land bearing we&s;t &s;outh we&s;t, and at fir&s;t I thought we had made a new di&s;covery. We &s;teered directly for it, and by ten o'clock were clo&s;e in with the north &s;ide of it, where we &s;aw hou&s;es, cocoa-nut trees, and, to our very agreeable &s;urpri&s;e, numerous flocks of &s;heep. This was a temptation not to be re&s;i&s;ted by people in our &s;ituation, e&s;pe|cially as many of us were in a bad &s;tate of health, and many &s;till repining at my not having touched at Timor: it was therefore &s;oon determined to attempt a commerce with people who appeared to be &s;o well able to &s;upply our many nece&s;&s;ities, and remove at once the &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;content that had got footing among us. The pinnace was hoi&s;ted out, and Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, &s;ent to &s;ee if there was any con|venient place to land, taking with him &s;ome trifles, as pre|&s;ents to the natives, if any of them &s;hould appear. While he was gone, we &s;aw from the &s;hip two men on hor&s;eback, who &s;eemed to be riding upon the hills for their amu&s;ement, and often &s;topped to look at the &s;hip. By this we knew that the place had been &s;ettled by Europeans, and hoped, that the ma|ny di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances which always attend the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of commerce with &s;avages, would be avoided. In the mean time, Mr. Gore landed in a &s;mall &s;andy cove, near &s;ome hou&s;es, and was met by eight or ten of the natives, who, as well in their dre&s;s as their per&s;ons, very much re&s;emb|led the Malays: they were without arms, except the knives which it is their cu&s;tom to wear in their girdles, and one of them had a jack a&s;s with him: they courteou&s;ly invited him a&s;hore, and conver&s;ed with him by &s;igns, but very little of the meaning of either party could be under&s;tood by the other. In a &s;hort time he returned with this report, and, to our great mortification, added, that there was no anchorage for the &s;hip. I &s;ent him however a &s;econd time, with both money and goods, that he might, if po&s;&s;ible, purcha&s;e &s;ome refre&s;hments, at lea&s;t for the &s;ick; and Dr. Solander went in the boat with him. In the mean time I kept &s;tanding on and off with the &s;hip, which at this time was within about a mile of the &s;hore. Before the boat could land, we &s;aw two other hor&s;emen, one of whom was in a compleat European dre&s;s, confiding of a blue coat, a white wai&s;tcoat, and a laced hat: the&s;e people, when the boat came to the &s;hore, took little notice of her, but &s;auntered about, and &s;eemed to look with great curio&s;ity at the &s;hip. We &s;aw however other hor&s;emen, and a great number of per&s;ons on foot, gather round our people, and, to our great &s;atisfaction, perceived &s;everal cocoa-nuts carried into the boat, from which we concluded that peace and commerce were e&s;tab|li&s;hed between us.</P>
<P>After the boat had been a&s;hore about an hour and a half, &s;he made the &s;ignal for having intelligence that there was a bay to leeward where we might anchor: we &s;tood away di|rectly
<PB N="168" REF="013324_0457_0F90501414449170">
for it, and the boat following, &s;oon came on board. The Lieutenant told us, that he had &s;een &s;ome of the princi|pal people, who were dre&s;&s;ed in fine linen, and had chains of gold round their necks: he &s;aid, that he had not been able to trade, becau&s;e the owner of the cocoa-nuts was ab&s;ent, but that about two dozen had been &s;ent to the boat as a pre&s;ent, and that &s;ome linen had been accepted in return. The people, to give him the information that he wanted, drew a map upon the &s;and, in which they made a rude repre&s;entation of a har|bour to leeward, and a town near it: they al&s;o gave him to under&s;tand, that &s;heep, hogs, fowls, and fruit might there be procured in great plenty. Some of them frequently pronoun|ced the word Portugue&s;e, and &s;aid &s;omething of Larntuca, upon the i&s;land of Ende: from this circum&s;tance, we conjec|tured that there were Portugue&s;e &s;omewhere upon the i&s;land, and a Portugue&s;e who was in our boat, attempted to conver&s;e with the Indians in that language, but &s;oon found that they knew only a word or two of it by rote: one of them however, when they were giving our people to under&s;tand that there was a town near the harbour to which they had directed us, inti|mated, that as a token of going right, we &s;hould &s;ee &s;ome|what, which he expre&s;&s;ed by cro&s;&s;ing his fingers, and the Por|tugue&s;e in&s;tantly conceived that he meant to expre&s;s a cro&s;s. Ju&s;t as our people were putting off, the hor&s;eman in the Eu|ropean dre&s;s came up, but the officer not having his commi&s;|&s;ion about him, thought it be&s;t to decline a conference.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock in the evening, we came to an anchor in the bay to which we had been directed, at about the di&s;tance of a mile from the &s;hore, in thirty-eight fathom water, with a clear &s;andy bottom. The north point of the bay bore N. 30 E. di&s;tant two miles and an half, and the &s;outh point, or we&s;t end of the i&s;land, bore S. 63 W. Ju&s;t as we got round the north point, and entered the bay, we di&s;covered a large In|dian town or village, upon which we &s;tood on, hoi&s;ting a jack on the fore top-ma&s;t head: &s;oon after, to our great &s;urprize, Dutch colours were hoi&s;ted in the town, and 3 guns fired; we &s;tood on, however, till we had &s;oundings, and then anchored.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was light in the morning, we &s;aw the &s;ame colours hoi&s;ted upon the beach, abrea&s;t of the &s;hip; &s;uppo&s;ing therefore that the Dutch had a &s;ettlement here, I &s;ent Lieuten|ant Gore a&s;hore, to wait upon the Governor, or the chief per&s;on re&s;iding upon the &s;pot, and acquaint him who we were, and for what purpo&s;e we had touched upon the coa&s;t. As &s;oon as he came a&s;hore, he was received by a guard of between twenty and thirty Indians, armed with mu&s;kets, who con|ducted him to the town, where the colours had been hoi&s;ted the night before, carrying with them tho&s;e that had been hoi&s;ted upon the beach, and marching without any military re|gularity. As &s;oon as he arrived, he was introduced to the
<PB N="169" REF="013324_0458_0F90F24DB05AFF70">
or King of the i&s;land, and by a Portugue&s;e interpreter, told him, that the &s;hip was a man of war belonging to the King of Grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-Britain, and that &s;he had many &s;ick on board, for whom he wanted to purcha&s;e &s;uch refre&s;hments as the i&s;land afforded. His Maje&s;ty replied, that he was willing to &s;up|ply us with whatever we wanted, but, that being in alliance with the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company, he was not at liberty to trade with any other people, without having fir&s;t procured their con&s;ent, for which however, he &s;aid he would imme|diately apply to a Dutchman, who belonged to the company, and who was the only white man upon the i&s;land. To this man, who re&s;ided at &s;ome di&s;tance, a letter was immediately di&s;patched, acquainting him with our arrival and reque&s;t: in the mean time, Mr. Gore di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to me, with an account of his &s;ituation, and the &s;tate of the treaty. In about three hours the Dutch re&s;ident an&s;wered the letter that had been &s;ent him, in per&s;on: he proved to be a native of Saxony, and his name is Johan Chri&s;topher Lange, and the &s;ame per&s;on whom we had &s;een on hor&s;eback in a European dre&s;s: he behaved with great civility to Mr. Gore, and a&s;|&s;ured him, that we were at liberty to purcha&s;e of the natives whatever we plea&s;ed. After a &s;hort time he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of coming on board, &s;o did the King al&s;o, and &s;everal of his attendants: Mr. Gore intimated that he was ready to attend them, but they de&s;ired that two of our people might be left a&s;hore as ho&s;tages, and in this al&s;o they were indulged.</P>
<P>About two o'clock, they all came aboard the &s;hip, and our dinner being ready, they accepted our invitation to partake of it: I expected them immediately to &s;it down, but the King &s;eemed to he&s;itate, and at la&s;t, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, &s;aid he did not imagine that we, who were white men, would &s;uffer him, who was of a different colour, to &s;it down in our com|pany; a compliment &s;oon removed his &s;cruples, and we all &s;at down together with great cheerfulne&s;s and cordiality: hap|pily we were at no lo&s;s for interpreters, both Dr. Solander and Mr. Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing under&s;tanding Dutch enough to keep up a conver&s;ation with Mr. Lange, and &s;everal of the &s;eamen were able to conver&s;e with &s;uch of the natives as &s;poke Portugue&s;e. Our dinner happened to be mutton, and the King expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of having an Engli&s;h &s;heep; we had but one left, how|ever that was pre&s;ented to him: the facility with which this was procured, encouraged him to a&s;k for an Engli&s;h dog, and Mr. Banks politely gave up his greyhound: Mr. Lange then intimated that a &s;pying-gla&s;s would be acceptable, and one was immediately put into his hand. Our gue&s;ts then told us that the i&s;land abounded with buffaloes, &s;heep, hogs, and fowls, plenty of which &s;hould be driven down to the beach the next day, that we might purcha&s;e as many of them as we
<PB N="170" REF="013324_0459_0F90EC9A2F609210">
&s;hould think fit: this put us all into high &s;pirits, and the li|quor circulated rather fa&s;ter than either the Indians or the Sa|xon could bear; they intimated their de&s;ire to go away, how|ever, before they were quite drunk, and were received upon deck, as they had been when they came on board, by the ma|rines under arms. The King expre&s;&s;ed a curio&s;ity to &s;ee them exerci&s;e, in which he was gratified, and they fired three rounds: he looked at them with great attention, and was much &s;urpri&s;ed at their regularity and expedition, e&s;pecially in cocking their pieces; the fir&s;t time they did it, he &s;truck the &s;ide of the &s;hip with a &s;tick that he had in his hand, and cried out with great vehemence, that all the locks made but one click. They were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with many pre&s;ents, and when they went away &s;aluted with nine guns: Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went a&s;hore with them; and as &s;oon as they put off they gave us three cheers.</P>
<P>Our Gentlemen, when they came a&s;hore, walked up with them to the town, which con&s;i&s;ts of many hou&s;es, and &s;ome of them are large; they are however nothing more than a thatched roof, &s;upported over a boarded floor, by pillars about four feet high. They produced &s;ome of their palm-wine, which was the fre&s;h, unfermented juice of the tree; it had a &s;weet, but not a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te; and hopes were conceived that it might contribute to recover our &s;ick from the &s;curvy. Soon after it was dark, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander returned on board.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 19th, I went a&s;hore with Mr. Banks, and &s;everal of the officers and gentlemen, to return the king's vi&s;it; but my chief bu&s;ine&s;s was to procure &s;ome of the buffa|loes, &s;heep and fowls, which we had been told &s;hould be driven down to the beach. We were greatly mortified to find that no &s;teps had been taken to fulfill this promi&s;e; however, we pro|ceeded to the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, which with two or three more had been erected by the Dutch Ea&s;t India company, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by two pieces of wood re&s;embling a pair of cow's horns, one of which is &s;et up at each end of the ridge that terminates the roof; and the&s;e were certainly what the Indian intended to repre&s;ent by cro&s;&s;ing his fingers, though our Portugue&s;e, who was a good Catholic, con&s;trued the &s;ign into a cro&s;s, which had per&s;uaded us that the &s;ettlement be|longed to his countrymen. In this place we met Mr. Lange, and the King, who&s;e name was A Mado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ho Lomi Djara, at|tended by many of the principal people. We told them that we had in the boat goods of various kinds, which we propo&s;ed to barter for &s;uch refre&s;hments as they would give us in exchange, and de&s;ired leave to bring them on &s;hore; which being granted, they were brought a&s;hore accordingly. We then attempted to &s;ettle the price of the buffaloes, &s;heep, hogs, and other
<PB N="171" REF="013324_0460_0F90F2534E7BDAF0">
commodities which we propo&s;ed to purcha&s;e, and for which we were to pay in money; but as &s;oon as this was mentioned Mr. Lange left us, telling us that the&s;e preliminaries mu&s;t be &s;ettled with the natives: he &s;aid, however, that he had re|ceived a letter from the Governor of Concordia in Timor, the purport of which he would communicate to us when he re|turned.</P>
<P>As the morning was now far advanced, and we were very unwilling to return on board and eat &s;alt provi&s;ions, when &s;o many delicacies &s;urrounded us a&s;hore, we petitioned his Maje&s;ty for liberty to purcha&s;e a &s;mall hog and &s;ome rice, and to employ his &s;ubjects to dre&s;s them for us. He an&s;wered very graciou&s;ly, that if we could eat victuals dre&s;&s;ed by his &s;ubjects, which he could &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;e, he would do him&s;elf the ho|nour of entertaining us. We expre&s;&s;ed our gratitude, and im|mediately &s;ent on board for liquors.</P>
<P>About five o'clock, dinner was ready; it was &s;erved in &s;ix and thirty di&s;hes, or rather ba&s;kets, containing alternately rice and pork; and three bowls of earthen ware, filled with the liquor in which the pork had been boiled: the&s;e were ranged upon the floor, and mats laid round them for us to &s;it upon. We were then conducted by turns to a hole in the floor, near which &s;tood a man with water in a ve&s;&s;el, made of the leaves of the fan-palm, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in wa&s;hing our hands. When this was done, we placed our&s;elves round the victuals, and waited for the King. As he did not come, we enquired for him, and were told that the cu&s;tom of the country did not permit the per&s;on who gave the entertainment to &s;it down with his gue&s;ts; but that, if we &s;u&s;pected the victuals to be poi&s;oned, he would come and ta&s;te it. We immediately declared that we had no &s;uch &s;u&s;picion, and de&s;ired that none of the rituals of ho&s;pitality might be violated on our account. The prime mini&s;ter and Mr. Lange were of our party, and we made a mo&s;t luxurious meal: we thought the pork and rice ex|cellent, and the broth not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; but the &s;poons, which were made of leaves, were &s;o &s;mall that few of us had patience to u&s;e them. After dinner, our wine pa&s;&s;ed bri&s;kly about, and we again enquired for our royal ho&s;t, thinking that though the cu&s;tom of this country would not allow him to eat with us, he might at lea&s;t &s;hare in the jollity of our bottle; but he again excu&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;aying, that the ma&s;ter of a fea&s;t &s;hould never be drunk, which there was no certain way to avoid but by not ta&s;ting the liquor. We did not however drink our wine where we had eaten our victuals; but as &s;oon as we had dined made room for the &s;eamen and &s;ervants, who imme|diately took our places: they could not di&s;patch all that we had left, but the women who came to clear away the bowls and ba&s;kets, obliged them to carry away with them what they
<PB N="172" REF="013324_0461_0F90F2583890C238">
had not eaten. As wine generally warms and opens the heart, we took an opportunity, when we thought its influence began to be felt, to revive the &s;ubject of the buffaloes and &s;heep, of which we had not in all this time heard a &s;yllable, though they were to have been brought down early in the morning. But our Saxon Dutchman, with great phlegm, began to com|municate to us the contents of the letter which he pretended to have received from the Governor of Concordia. He &s;aid, that after acquainting him that a ve&s;&s;el had &s;teered from thence towards the i&s;land where we were now a&s;hore, it required him, if &s;uch &s;hip &s;hould apply for provi&s;ion in di&s;tre&s;s, to re|lieve her; but not to &s;uffer her to &s;tay longer than was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, nor to make any large pre&s;ents to the infe|rior people, or to leave any with tho&s;e of &s;uperior rank to be afterwards di&s;tributed among them: but he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to add, that we were at liberty to give beads and other trifles in exchange for petty civilities, and palm-wine.</P>
<P>It was the general opinion that this letter was a fiction; that the prohibitory orders were feigned with a view to get money from us for breaking them; and that by precluding our liberality to the natives, this man hoped more ea&s;ily to turn it into another channel.</P>
<P>In the evening, we receiv'd intelligence from our trading-place that no buffaloes or hogs had been brought down, and only a few &s;heep, which had been taken away before our people, who had &s;ent for money, could procure it. Some fowls however had been bought, and a large quantity of a kind of &s;yrup made of the juice of the palm tree, which, though infinitely &s;uperior to mola&s;&s;es or treacle, &s;old at a very low price. We complained of our di&s;appointment to Mr. Lange, who had now another &s;ubterfuge; he &s;aid, that if we had gone down to the beach our&s;elves, we might have purcha&s;ed what we plea&s;ed; but that the natives were afraid to take money of our people, left it &s;hould be counterfeit. We could not but feel &s;ome indignation again&s;t a man who had concealed this, be|ing true; or alledged it, being fal&s;e. I &s;tarted up, however, and went immediately to the beach. but no cattle or &s;heep were to be &s;een, nor were any at hand to be produced. While I was gone, Lange, who knew well enough that I &s;hould &s;uc|ceed no better than my people, told Mr. Banks that the na|tives were di&s;plea&s;ed at our not having offered gold for their &s;tock; and that if gold was not offered, nothing would be bought. Mr. Banks did not think it worth his while to reply, but &s;oon after ro&s;e up, and we all returned on board, very much di&s;&s;atisfied with the i&s;&s;ue of our negociations. During the cour&s;e of the day, the King had promi&s;ed that &s;ome cattle and &s;heep &s;hould be brought down in the morning, and had given a rea&s;on for our di&s;appointment &s;omewhat more plau|&s;ible;
<PB N="173" REF="013324_0462_0F90F259C0C9D7E0">
he &s;aid that the buffaloes were far up the country, and that there had not been time to bring them down to the beach.</P>
<P>The next morning we went a&s;hore again: Dr. Solander went up to the town to &s;peak to Lange, and I remained upon the beach, to &s;ee what could be done in the purcha&s;e of pro|vi&s;ions. I found here an old Indian, who, as he appeared to have &s;ome authority, we had among our&s;elves called the Prime Mini&s;ter; to engage this man in our intere&s;t I pre&s;ented him with a &s;pying-gla&s;s, but I &s;aw nothing at market except one &s;mall buffalo. I enquired the price of it, and was told five guineas: this was twice as much as it was worth; however, I offered three, which I could perceive the man who treated with me thought a good price; but he &s;aid that he mu&s;t ac|quaint the King with what I had offered before he could take it. A me&s;&s;enger was immediately di&s;patched to his Maje&s;ty, who &s;oon returned, and &s;aid, that the buffalo would not be &s;old for anything le&s;s than five guineas. This price I ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to give; and another me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent away with an account of my refu&s;al: this me&s;&s;enger was longer ab|&s;ent than the other, and while I was waiting for his return, I &s;aw, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment, Dr. Solander coming from the town, followed by above an hundred men, &s;ome armed with mu&s;quets, and &s;ome with lances. When I enquired the mean|ing of this ho&s;tile appearance, the Doctor told me, that Mr. Lange had interpreted to him a me&s;&s;age from the King, pur|porting that the people would not trade with us, becau&s;e we had refu&s;ed to give them more than half the value of what they had to &s;ell; and that we &s;hould not be permitted to trade upon any terms longer than this day. Be&s;ides the officers who commanded the party, there came with it a man who was born at Timor, of Portugue&s;e parents, and who, as we after|wards di&s;covered, was a kind of colleague to the Dutch fac|tor; by this man what they pretended to be the King's order was delivered to me, of the &s;ame purport with that which Dr. Solander had received from Lange. We were all clearly of opinion that this was a mere artifice of the factors to extort money from us, for which we had been prepared by the ac|count of a letter from Concordia; and while we were he&s;itat|ing what &s;tep to take, the Portugue&s;e, that he might the &s;ooner accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e, began to drive away the people who had brought down poultry and &s;yrup, and others that were now coming in with buffaloes and &s;heep. At this time, I glanced my eye upon the old man whom I had compliment|ed in the morning with the &s;pying-gla&s;s, and I thought, by his looks, that he did not heartily approve of what was doing; I therefore took him by the hand, and pre&s;ented him with an old broad &s;word. This in&s;tantly turned the &s;cale in our fa|vour; he received the &s;word with a tran&s;port of joy, and
<PB N="174" REF="013324_0463_0F905014A88E2FD8">
flouri&s;hing it over the bu&s;y Portugue&s;e, who crouched like a fox to a lion, he made him, and the officer who commanded the party, &s;it down upon the ground behind him: the people, who, whatever were the crafty pretences of the&s;e iniquitous factors for a Dutch company, were eager to &s;upply us with whatever we wanted, and &s;eemed al&s;o to be more de&s;irous of goods than money, in&s;tantly improved the advantage that had been procured them, and the market was &s;tocked almo&s;t in an in&s;tant. To e&s;tabli&s;h a trade for buffaloes, however, which I mo&s;t wanted, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to give ten guineas for two, one of which weighed no more than a hundred and &s;ixty pounds; but I bought &s;even more much cheaper, and might afterwards have purcha&s;ed as many as I plea&s;ed almo&s;t upon my own terms, for they were now driven down to the water-&s;ide in herds. In the fir&s;t two that I bought &s;o dear, Lange had certainly a &s;hare, and it was in hopes to obtain part of the price of others, that he had pretended we mu&s;t pay for them in gold. The natives however &s;old what they afterwards brought down much to their &s;atisfaction, without paying part of the price to him as a reward for exacting mo|ney from us. Mo&s;t of the buffaloes that we bought, after our friend, the Prime Mini&s;ter, had procured us a fair market, were &s;old for a mu&s;quet a piece, and at this price we might have bought as many as would have freighted our &s;hip.</P>
<P>The refre&s;hments which we procured here, con&s;i&s;ted of nine buffaloes, &s;ix &s;heep, three hogs, thirty dozen of fowls, a few limes, and &s;ome cocoa-nuts; many dozen of eggs, half of which however proved to be rotten; a little garlic, and &s;e|veral hundred gallons of palm-&s;yrup.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. A particular De&s;cription of the I&s;land of Savu, its Produce and Inhabitants, with a Specimen of their Language.</HEAD>
<P>THIS i&s;land is called by the natives SAVU; the middle of it lies in about the latitude 10&deg; 35&prime; S., longitude 237&deg; 30&prime; W.; and has in general been &s;o little known that I never &s;aw a map or chart in which it is clearly or accurately laid down. I have &s;een a very old one, in which it is called Sou, and confounded with Sandel Bo&s;ch. Rumphius mentions an i&s;land by the name of Saow; and he al&s;o &s;ays that it is the &s;ame which the Dutch call Sandel Bo&s;ch; but neither is this i&s;land, nor Timor, nor Rotte, nor indeed any one of the i&s;lands that we have &s;een in the&s;e &s;eas, placed within a rea&s;onable di&s;tance of its true &s;ituation. It is about eight leagues long
<PB N="175" REF="013324_0464_0F90F25A7AF48780">
from ea&s;t to we&s;t; but what is its breadth, I do not know, as I &s;aw only the north &s;ide. The harbour in which we lay is called Seba, from the di&s;trict in which it lies: it is on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and well &s;heltered from the &s;outh we&s;t trade wind, but it lies open to the north we&s;t. We were told, that there were two other bays where &s;hips might an|chor; that the be&s;t, called Timo, was on the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;outh ea&s;t point: of the third we learnt neither the name nor &s;ituation. The &s;ea-coa&s;t, in general, is low; but in the middle of the i&s;land there are hills of a con&s;iderable height. We were upon the coa&s;t at the latter end of the dry &s;ea&s;on, when there had been no rain for &s;even months; and we were told that when the dry &s;ea&s;on continues &s;o long, there is no running &s;tream of fre&s;h water upon the whole i&s;land, but only &s;mall &s;prings, which are at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;ea-&s;ide: yet nothing can be imagined &s;o beautiful as the pro&s;pect of the country from the &s;hip. The level ground next to the &s;ea-&s;ide was covered with cocoa-nut trees, and a kind of palm called <HI>Arecas;</HI> and beyond them the hills, which ro&s;e in a gentle and regular a&s;cent, were richly clothed, quite to the &s;ummit, with plantations of the fan-palm, form|ing an almo&s;t impenetrable grove. How much even this pro&s;pect mu&s;t be improved, when every foot of ground between the trees is covered with verdure, by maize, and millet and indico, can &s;carcely be conceived but by a powerful imagina|tion, not unacquainted with the &s;tateline&s;s and beauty of the trees that adorn this part of the earth. The dry &s;ea&s;on com|mences in March or April, and ends in October or November.</P>
<P>The principal trees of this i&s;land, are the fan-palm, the cocoa-nut, tamarind, limes, oranges, and mangoes; the other vegetable productions are maize, Guinea corn, rice, millet, callevances, and water-melons. We &s;aw al&s;o one &s;ugar-cane, and a few kinds of European garden-&s;tuff; par|ticularly cellery, marjoram, fennel, and garlic. For the &s;up|ply of luxury, it has betele, areca, tobacco, cotton, indico, and a &s;mall quantity of cinnamon, which &s;eems to be planted here only for curio&s;ity; and indeed we doubted whether it was the genuine plant, knowing that the Dutch are very careful not to tru&s;t the &s;pices out of their proper i&s;lands. There are however &s;everal kinds of fruit, be&s;ides tho&s;e which have been already mentioned; particularly the &s;weet &s;op, which is well known to the We&s;t Indians, and a &s;mall oval fruit, called the <HI>Blimbi,</HI> both of which grow upon trees. The Blimbi is about three or four inches long, and in the middle about as thick as a man's finger, tapering towards each end: it is covered with a very think &s;kin of a light green colour, and in the in&s;ide are a few &s;eeds di&s;po&s;ed in the form of a &s;tar: its flavour is a light, clean, plea&s;ant acid, but it cannot be eaten raw; it is &s;aid to
<PB N="176" REF="013324_0465_0F905015641A5710">
be excellent as a pickle; and &s;tewed, it made a mo&s;t agreeable four &s;auce to our boiled di&s;hes.</P>
<P>The tame animals are buffaloes, &s;heep, goats, hogs, fowls, pigeons, hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, dogs and cats; and of all the&s;e there is great plenty. The buffaloes differ very con&s;iderably from the horned cattle of Europe in &s;everal particulars; their ears are much larger, their &s;kins are almo&s;t without hair, their horns are curved towards each other, but together <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">end di|rectly backwards, and they have no dewlaps. We &s;aw &s;everal that were as big as a well grown European ox, and there mu&s;t be &s;ome much larger; for Mr. Banks &s;aw a pair of horns which mea&s;ured from tip to tip three feet nine inches and an half, acro&s;s their wide&s;t diameter four feet one inch and an half, and in the whole &s;weep of their &s;emi-circle in front &s;e|ven feet &s;ix inches and a half. It mu&s;t however be ob&s;erved, that a buffalo here of any given &s;ize, does not weigh above half as much as an ox of the &s;ame &s;ize in England: tho&s;e that we gue&s;&s;ed to weigh four hundred weight did not weigh more than two hundred and fifty; the rea&s;on is, that &s;o late in the dry &s;ea&s;on the bones are very thinly covered with fle&s;h: there is not an ounce of fat in a whole carca&s;s, and the flanks are li|terally nothing but &s;kin and bone: the fle&s;h however is well ta&s;ted and juicy, and I &s;uppo&s;e better than the fle&s;h of an Eng|li&s;h ox would be if he was to &s;tarve in this &s;un-burnt country.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es are from eleven to twelve hands high, but though they are &s;mall, they are &s;pirited and nimble, e&s;pecially in pacing, which is their common &s;tep: the inhabitants ge|nerally ride them without a &s;addle, and with no better bridle than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The &s;heep are of the kind which in England are called Bengal &s;heep, and differ from ours in many parti|culars. They are covered with hair in&s;tead of wool, their ears are very large, and hang down under their horns, and their no&s;es are arched; they are thought to have a general re&s;emblance to a goat, and for that rea&s;on are frequently cal|led <HI>cabritos:</HI> their fle&s;h we thought the wor&s;t mutton we had ever eaten, being as lean as that of the buffaloes, and with|out flavour. The hogs, however, were &s;ome of the fa&s;te&s;t that we had ever &s;een, though, as we were told, their princi|pal food is the out&s;ide hu&s;ks of rice, and the palm &s;yrup di&s;&s;olv|ed in water. The fowls are chiefly of the game breed, and large, but the eggs are remarkably &s;mall.</P>
<P>Of the fi&s;h which the &s;ea produces here, we know but little: turtles are &s;ometimes found upon the coa&s;t, and are by the&s;e people, as well as all others, con&s;idered as a dainty.</P>
<P>The people are rather under, than over the middling &s;ize; the women e&s;pecially are remarkably &s;hort and &s;quat built: their complexion is a dark brown, and their hair univer&s;ally black and lank. We &s;aw no difference in the colour of rich
<PB N="177" REF="013324_0466_0F90F25B51B19638">
and poor, though in the South Sea i&s;lands tho&s;e that were expo&s;ed to the weather were almo&s;t as brown as the New Hol|landers, and the better &s;ort nearly as fair as the natives of Eu|rope. The men are in general well-made, vigorous, and active, and have a greater variety in the make and di&s;po&s;ition of their features than u&s;ual; the countenances of the women, on the contrary, are all alike.</P>
<P>The men fa&s;ten their hair up to the top of their heads with a comb, the women tie it behind in a club, which is very very far from becoming. Both &s;exes eradicate the hair from under the arm, and the men do the &s;ame by their beards, for which purpo&s;e the better &s;ort always carry a pair of &s;ilver pincers hanging by a &s;tring round their necks; &s;ome however &s;uffer a very little hair to remain upon their upper lips, but this is always kept &s;hort.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of both &s;exes con&s;i&s;ts of cotton cloth, which be|ing died blue in the yarn, and not uniformly of the &s;ame &s;hade, is in clouds or waves of that colour, and even in our eye had not an inelegant appearance. This cloth they ma|nufacture them&s;elves, and two pieces, each about two yards long, and a yard and a half wide, make a dre&s;s: one of them is worn round the middle, and the other covers the upper part of the body: the lower edge of the piece that goes round the middle, the men draw pretty tight ju&s;t below the fork, the upper edge of it is left loo&s;e, &s;o as to form a kind of hollow belt, which &s;erves them as a pocket to carry their knives, and other little implements which it is convenient to have about them. The other piece of cloth is pa&s;&s;ed through this girdle behind, and one end of it being brought over the left &s;houlder, and the other over the right, they fall down over the brea&s;t, and are tucked into the girdle before, &s;o that by opening or clo&s;ing the plaits, they can cover more or le&s;s of their bodies as they plea&s;e; the arms, legs, and feet are always naked. The difference between the dre&s;s of the two &s;exes con&s;i&s;ts prin|cipally in the manner of wearing the wai&s;t-piece, for the wo|men, in&s;tead of drawing the lower edge tight, and leaving the upper edge loo&s;e for a pocket, draw the upper edge tight, and let the lower edge fall as low as the knees, &s;o as to form a petticoat; the body-piece, in&s;tead of being pa&s;&s;ed through the girdle, is fa&s;tened under the arms, and cro&s;s the brea&s;t, with the utmo&s;t decency. I have already ob&s;erved, that the men fa&s;ten the hair upon the top of the head, and the women tie it in a club behind, but there is another difference in the head|dre&s;s, by which the &s;exes are di&s;tingui&s;hed: the women wear nothing as a &s;uccedaneum for a cap, but the men con&s;tantly wrap &s;omething round their heads in the manner of a fillet; it is &s;mall, but generally of the fine&s;t materials that can be pro|cured: we &s;aw &s;ome who applied &s;ilk handkerchiefs to this
<PB N="178" REF="013324_0467_0F90F25BF9C43D10">
purpo&s;e, and others that wore fine cotton, or mu&s;lin, in the manner of a &s;mall turban.</P>
<P>The&s;e people bore their te&s;timony that the love of finery is a univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, for their ornaments were very numerous. Some of the better &s;ort wore chains of gold round their necks, but they were made of plaited wire, and con&s;equently were light and of little value; others had rings, which were &s;o much worn that they &s;eemed to have de&s;cended through many generations; and one per&s;on had a &s;ilver-headed cane, marked with a kind of cypher, con&s;i&s;ting of the Roman letters V. O. C. and therefore probably a pre&s;ent from the Dutch Ea&s;t In|dia Company, who&s;e mark it is: they have al&s;o ornaments made of beads, which &s;ome wear round their necks as a &s;oli|taire, and others, as bracelets, upon their wri&s;ts: the&s;e are common to both &s;exes, but the women have be&s;ides, &s;trings or girdles of beads, which they wear round their wai&s;ts, and which &s;erve to keep up their petticoat. Both &s;exes had their ears bored, nor was there a &s;ingle exception that fell under our notice, yet we never &s;aw an ornament in any of them; we never indeed &s;aw either man or woman in any thing but what appeared to be their ordinary dre&s;s, except the King and his Mini&s;ter, who in general wore a kind of night-gown of coar&s;e chintz, and one of whom once received us in a black robe, which appeared to be made of what is called prince's &s;tuff. We &s;aw &s;ome boys, about twelve or fourteen years old, who had &s;piral circles of thick bra&s;s wire pa&s;&s;ed three or four times round their arms, above the elbow, and &s;ome men wore rings of ivory, two inches in breadth, and above an inch in thickne&s;s, upon the &s;ame part of the arm: the&s;e, we were told, were the &s;ons of the Rajas, or Chiefs, who wore the&s;e cum|brous ornaments as badges of their high birth.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the men had their names traced upon their arms, in indelible characters of a black colour, and the women had a &s;quare ornament of flouri&s;hed lines, impre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, ju&s;t under the bend of the elbow. We were &s;truck with the &s;imilitude between the&s;e marks, and tho&s;e made by tattowing in the South Sea i&s;lands, and upon enquiring into its origin, we learnt that it had been practi&s;ed by the natives long before any Europeans came among them; and that in the neighbouring i&s;lands the inhabitants were marked with circles upon their necks and brea&s;ts. The univer&s;ality of this practice, which prevails among &s;avages in all parts of the world, from the remote&s;t limits of North America, to the i&s;lands in the South Seas, and which probably differs but little from the method of &s;taining the body that was in u&s;e among the ancient inhabitants of Britain, is a curious &s;ubject for &s;pe|culation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the account which Mr. Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">u has given of &s;ome Indians who inhabit the banks of the Akanza, a river of North America, which ri&s;es in New Mexico, and falls into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, he relates the following incident: "The Akan|za's, &s;ays he, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me, and as a mark of my privilege, have imprint|ed the figure of a roc-buck upon my thigh, which was done in this manner: an Indian having burnt &s;ome &s;traw, diluted the a&s;hes with water, and with this mixture, drew the figure upon my &s;kin; he then retraced it, by pricking the lines with needles, &s;o as at every puncture ju&s;t to draw the blood, and the blood mixing with the a&s;hes of the &s;traw, forms a figure which can never be effaced."

The hou&s;es of Savu are all built upon the &s;ame plan, and differ only in &s;ize, being large in proportion to the rank and riches of the proprietor. Some are four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> feet long, and &s;ome are not more than twenty: they are all rai&s;ed upon po&s;ts, or piles, about four feet high, one end of which is driven into the ground, and upon the other end is laid a &s;ub|&s;tantial floor of wood, &s;o that there is a vacant &s;pace of four feet between the floor of the hou&s;e and the ground. Upon this floor are placed other po&s;ts or pillars, that &s;upport a roof of &s;loping &s;ides, which meet in a ridge at the top, like tho&s;e of our barns: the caves of this roof, which is thatched with palm leaves, reach within two feet of the floor, and over-hang it as much: the &s;pace within is generally divided lengthwi&s;e into three equal parts; the middle part, or center, is inclo&s;ed by a partition of four floes, reaching about &s;ix feet above the floor, and one or two &s;mall rooms are al&s;o &s;ometimes taken off from the &s;ides, the re&s;t of the &s;pace under the roof is open, &s;o as freely to admit the air and the light: the particular u&s;es of the&s;e different apartments, our &s;hort &s;tay would not permit us to learn, except that the clo&s;e room in the center was appro|priated to the women.</P>
<P>The food of the&s;e people con&s;i&s;ts of every tame animal in the country, of which the hog holds the fir&s;t place in their e&s;timation, and the hor&s;e the &s;econd; next to the hor&s;e is the buffalo, next to the buffalo their poultry, and they prefer dogs and cats to &s;heep and goats. They are not fond of fi&s;h, and, I believe, it is never eaten but by the poor people, nor by them, except when their duty or bu&s;ine&s;s requires them to be upon the beach, and then every man is furni&s;hed with a light ca&s;ting net, which is girt round him, and makes part of his dre&s;s; and with this he takes any &s;mall fi&s;h which happen to come in his way.</P>
<P>The e&s;culent vegetables and fruits have been mentioned al|ready, but the fan-palm requires more particular notice, for at certain times it is a &s;uccedaneum for all other food both to man and bea&s;t. A kind of wine, called toddy, is procured from this tree, by cutting the buds which are to produce flow|ers, &s;oon after their appearance, and tying under them &s;mall ba&s;kets, made of the leaves, which are &s;o clo&s;e as to hold li|quids

without leaking. The juice which trickles into the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, is collected by per&s;ons who climb the trees for that purpo&s;e, morning and evening, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s the common drink of every individual upon the i&s;land; yet a much greater quantity is drawn off than is con&s;umed in this u&s;e, and of the &s;urplus they make both a &s;yrup and coar&s;e &s;ugar. The liquor is called <HI>dua,</HI> or <HI>duac,</HI> and both the &s;yrup and &s;ugar <HI>gula.</HI> The &s;yrup is prepared by boiling the liquor down in pots of ear hen ware, till it is &s;ufficiently in&s;pi&s;&s;ated; it is not unlike treacle in appearance, but is &s;omewhat thicker, and has a much more agreeable ta&s;te: the &s;ugar is of a reddi&s;h brown, perhaps the &s;ame with the Jugata &s;ugar upon the continent of India, and it was more agreeable to our palates than any cane &s;ugar unre|fined, that we had ever ta&s;ted. We were at fir&s;t afraid that the &s;yrup, of which &s;ome of our people eat very great quanti|ties, would have brought on fluxes, but its aperient quality was &s;o very &s;light, that what effect it produced was rather &s;alu|tary than hurtful. I have already ob&s;erved, that it is given with the hu&s;ks of rice to the hogs, and that they grow enor|mou&s;ly fat without taking any other food: we were told al&s;o, that this &s;yrup is u&s;ed to fatten their dogs and their fowls, and that the inhabitants them&s;elves have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon this alone for &s;everal months, when other crops have failed, and animal food has been &s;carce. The leaves of this tree are al&s;o put to various u&s;es, they thatch hou&s;es, and make ba&s;kets, cups, umbrellas, and tobacco-pipes. The fruit is lea&s;t e&s;teemed, and as the blo&s;&s;oms are wounded for the tuac or toddy, there is not much of it: it is about as big as a large turnip, and covered like the cocoa-nut, with a fibrous coat, under which are three kernels, that mu&s;t be eaten before they are ripe, for afterwards they become &s;o hard that they cannot be chew|ed; in their eatable &s;tate they ta&s;te not unlike a green cocoa-nut, and, like them, probably they yield a nutriment that is watry and un&s;ub&s;tantial.</P>
<P>The common method of dre&s;&s;ing food here is by boiling, and as fire-wood is very &s;carce, and the inhabitants have no other fuel, they make u&s;e of a contrivance to &s;ave it, that is not wholly unknown in Europe, but is &s;eldom practi&s;ed ex|cept in camps. They dig a hollow under ground, in a hori|zontal direction, like a rabbit burrow, about two yards long, and opening into a hole at each end, one of which is large and the other &s;mall: by the large hole the fire is put in, and the &s;mall one &s;erves for a draught. The earth over this bur|row is perforated by circular holes, which communicate with the cavity below; and in the&s;e holes are &s;et earthen pots, ge|nerally about three to each fire, which are large in the middle, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">per towards the bottom, &s;o that the fire acts upon a large part of their &s;urface. Each of the&s;e pots generally contains
<PB N="181" REF="013324_0470_0F90F25D782AE418">
about eight or ten gallons, and it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee with how &s;mall a quantity of fire they may be kept boiling; a palm leaf, or a dry &s;talk, thru&s;t in now and then, is &s;ufficient: in this manner they boil all their victuals, and make all their &s;yrup and &s;ugar. It appears by Frazier's account of his voy|age to the South Sea, that the Peruvian Indians have a con|trivance of the &s;ame kind, and perhaps it might be adopted with advantage by the poor people even of this country, where fuel is very dear.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes are en&s;laved by the hateful and pernicious habit of chewing betele and areca, which they contract even while they are children, and practi&s;e ince&s;&s;antly from morning till night. With the&s;e they always mix a kind of white lime, made of coral &s;tone and &s;hells, and frequently a &s;mall quan|tity of tobacco, &s;o that their mouths are di&s;gu&s;tful in the high|e&s;t degree both to the &s;mell and the &s;ight: the tobacco taints their breath, and the beetle and lime make the teeth not on|ly as black as charcoal, but as rotten too. I have &s;een men between twenty and thirty, who&s;e fore-teeth have been con|&s;umed almo&s;t down to the gums, tho' no 2 of them were exact|ly of the &s;ame length or thickne&s;s, but irregularly corroded like iron by ru&s;t. This lo&s;s of teeth is, I think, by all who have written upon the &s;ubject, imputed to the tough and &s;trin|gy coat of the areca nut; but I impute it wholly to the lime: they are not loo&s;ened, or broken, or forced out, as might be expected if they were injured by the continual chewing of hard and rough &s;ub&s;tances, but they are gradually wa&s;ted like me|tals that are expo&s;ed to the action of powerful acids; the &s;tumps always adhering firmly to the &s;ocket in the jaw, when there is no part of the tooth above the gums: and po&s;&s;ibly tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ugar has a bad effect upon the teeth of Eu|ropeans, may not be mi&s;taken, for it is well known that re|fined loaf &s;ugar contains a con&s;iderable quantity of lime; and he that doubts whether lime will de&s;troy bone of any kind, may ea&s;ily a&s;certain the fact by experiment.</P>
<P>If the people here are at any time without this odious mouthful, they are &s;moaking. This operation they perform by rolling up a &s;mall quantity of tobacco, and putting it into one end of a tube about &s;ix inches long, and as thick as a goo&s;e quill, which they make of a palm leaf. As the quanti|ty of tobacco in the&s;e pipes is very &s;mall, the effect of it is in|crea&s;ed, e&s;pecially among the women, by &s;wallowing the &s;moke.</P>
<P>When the natives of this i&s;land were fir&s;t formed into a civil &s;ociety, is not certainly known, but at pre&s;ent it is di|vided into five principalities or nigrees: LAAI, SEBA, RE|OEEUA, TIMO, and MASSARA, each of which is governed by its re&s;pective Raja or King. The Raja of Seba, the prin|cipality
<PB N="182" REF="013324_0471_0F90501986A35F10">
in which we were a&s;hore, &s;eemed to have great autho|rity, without much external parade or &s;how, or much appear|ance of per&s;onal re&s;pect. He was about five and thirty years of age, and the fatte&s;t man we &s;aw upon the whole i&s;land: he appeared to be of a dull phlegmatic di&s;po&s;ition, and to be di|rected almo&s;t implicitly by the old man who, upon my pre|&s;enting him with a &s;word, had procured us a fair market, in &s;pight of the craft and avarice of the Dutch factors. The name of this per&s;on was MANNU DJARME, and it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that he was a man of uncommon integrity and abilities, as, notwith&s;tanding his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power in the character of a favourite, he was beloved by the whole princi|pality. If any difference ari&s;es among the people, it is &s;ettled by the Raja and his coun&s;ellors, without delay or appeal, and, as we were told, with the mo&s;t &s;olemn deliberation and im|partial ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>We were informed by Mr. Lange, that the chiefs who had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pre&s;ided over the five principalities of this i&s;land, had lived for time immemorial in the &s;tricte&s;t alliance and mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip with each other; yet he &s;aid the people were of a warlike di&s;po&s;ition, and had always courageou&s;ly defended them&s;elves again&s;t foreign invaders. We were told al&s;o, that the i&s;land was able to rai&s;e, upon very &s;hort notice, 7300 fighting men, armed with mu&s;kets, &s;pears, lances, and targets. Of this force, Laai was &s;aid to furni&s;h 2600, Seba 2000, Regeeua 1500, Timo 800, and Ma&s;&s;ara 400. Be&s;ides the arms that have been already mentioned, each man is fur|ni&s;hed with a large pole-ax, re&s;embling a wood-bill, except that it has a &s;trait edge, and is much heavier: this, in the hands of people who have courage to come to clo&s;e quarters with an enemy, mu&s;t be a dreadful weapon; and we were told that they were &s;o dextrous with their lances, that at the di&s;|tance of &s;ixty feet they would throw them with &s;uch exactne&s;s as to pierce a man's heart, and &s;uch force as to go quite through his body.</P>
<P>How far this account of the martial prowe&s;s of the inha|bitants of Savu may be true, we cannot take upon us to de|termine, but during our &s;tay, we &s;aw no appearance of it. We &s;aw indeed in the town-hou&s;e, or hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, about one hundred &s;pears and targets, which &s;erved to arm the people who were &s;ent down to intimidate us at the trading place; but they &s;eemed to be the refu&s;e of old armories, no two being of the &s;ame make or length, for &s;ome were &s;ix, and &s;ome &s;ixteen feet long: we &s;aw no lance among them, and as to the mu&s;kets, though they were clean on the out&s;ide, they were eaten into holes by the ru&s;t within; and the people them|&s;elves appeared to be &s;o little acquainted with military di&s;ci|pline, that they marched like a di&s;orderly rabble, every one
<PB N="183" REF="013324_0472_0F90F25E501E4C08">
having, in&s;tead of his target, a cock, &s;ome tobacco, or other merchandi&s;e of the like kind, which he took that opportunity to bring down to &s;ell, and a few or none of their cartridge boxes were furni&s;hed with either powder or ball, though a piece of paper was thru&s;t into the whole to &s;ave appearances. We &s;aw a few &s;wivel guns, and pateraroes at the town-hou&s;e, and a great gun before it; but the &s;wivels and pateraros lay out of their carriages, and the great gun lay upon a heap of &s;tones, almo&s;t con&s;umed with ru&s;t, with the touch-hole down|wards, po&s;&s;ibly to conceal its &s;ize, which might perhaps be little le&s;s than that of the bore.</P>
<P>We could not di&s;cover that among the&s;e people there was any rank of di&s;tinction between the Raja and the land-owners: the land-owners were re&s;pectable in proportion to their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions; the inferior ranks con&s;i&s;t of manufacturers, labouring poor, and &s;laves. The &s;laves, like the pea&s;ants in &s;ome parts of Europe, are connected with the e&s;tate, and both de&s;cend together: but though the land-owner can &s;ell his &s;lave, he has no other power over his per&s;on, not even to correct him, with|out the privity and approbation of the Raja. Some have five hundred of the&s;e &s;laves, and &s;ome not half a dozen: the com|mon price of them is a fat hog. When a great man goes out, he is con&s;tantly attended by two or more of them: one of them carries a &s;word or hanger, the hilt of which is common|ly of &s;ilver, and adorned with large ta&s;&s;els of hor&s;e hair; and another carries a bag which contains betel, areca, lime and tobacco. In the&s;e attendants con&s;i&s;ts all their magnificence, for the Raja him&s;elf has no other mark of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The chief object of pride among the&s;e people, like that of a Welchman, is a long pedigree of re&s;pectable ance&s;tors, and indeed a veneration for antiquity &s;eems to be carried farther here than in any other country: even a hou&s;e that has been well inhabited for many generations, becomes almo&s;t &s;acred, and few articles either of u&s;e or luxury bear &s;o high a price as &s;tones, which having been long &s;at upon, are become even and &s;mooth: tho&s;e who can purcha&s;e &s;uch &s;tones, or are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of them by inheritance, place them round their hou&s;es, where they &s;erve as &s;eats for their dependants.</P>
<P>Every Raja &s;ets up in the principal town of his province, or nigree, a large &s;tone, which &s;erves as a memorial of his reign. In the principal town of Seba, where we lay, there are thirteen &s;uch &s;tones, be&s;ides many fragments of others, which had been &s;et up in earlier times, and are now moulder|ing away: the&s;e monuments &s;eem to prove that &s;ome kind of civil e&s;tabli&s;hment here is of con&s;iderable antiquity. The la&s;t thirteen reigns in England make &s;omething more than 276 years.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e &s;tones are &s;o large, that it is difficult to con|ceive
<PB N="184" REF="013324_0473_0F90501AE19F1228">
by what means they were brought to their pre&s;ent &s;ta|tion, e&s;pecially as it is the &s;ummit of a hill; but the world is full of memorials of human &s;trength, in which the me|chanical powers that have been &s;ince added by mathematical &s;cience, &s;eem to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; and of &s;uch monuments there are not a few among the remains of barbarous antiquity in our own country, be&s;ides tho&s;e upon Sali&s;bury plain.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tones not only record the reigns of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive princes, but &s;erve for a purpo&s;e much more extraordinary, and pro|bably altogether peculiar to this country. When a Raja dies, a general fea&s;t is proclaimed throughout his dominions, and all his &s;ubjects a&s;&s;emble round the&s;e &s;tones; almo&s;t every liv|ing creature that can be caught is then killed, and the fea&s;t la&s;ts for a le&s;s or greater number of weeks or months, as the kingdom happens to be more or le&s;s furni&s;hed with live &s;tock at the time; the &s;tones &s;erve for tables. When this madne&s;s is over, a fa&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue, and the whole kingdom is obliged to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon &s;yrup and water, if it happens in the dry &s;ea&s;on, when no vegetables can be procured, till a new &s;tock of animals can be rai&s;ed from the few that have e&s;caped by chance, or been pre&s;erved by policy from the ge|neral ma&s;&s;acre, or can be procured from the neighbouring kingdoms. Such, however, is the account we received from Mr. Lange.</P>
<P>We had no opportunity to examine any of their manufac|tures, except that of their cloth, which they &s;pin, weave, and dye; we did not indeed &s;ee them employed, but many of the in&s;truments which they u&s;e fell in our way. We &s;aw their machine for clearing cotton of its &s;eed, which is make upon the &s;ame principles as tho&s;e in Europe, but is &s;o &s;mall that it might be taken for a model, or a toy: it con&s;i&s;ts of two cy|linders, like our round rulers, &s;omewhat le&s;s than an inch in diameter, one of which being turned round by a plain winch, turns the other by means of an endle&s;s worm; and the whole machine is not more than fourteen inches long, and &s;even high: that which we &s;aw had been much u&s;ed, and many pieces of cotton were hanging about it, &s;o that there is no rea&s;on to doubt its being a fair &s;pecimen of the re&s;t. We al&s;o once &s;aw their apparatus for &s;pinning; it con&s;i&s;ted of a bob|bin, on which was wound a &s;mall quantity of thread, and a kind of di&s;taff filled with cotton; we conjectured therefore that they &s;pin by hand, as the women of Europe did before the introduction of wheels; and I am told that they have not yet found their way into &s;ome parts of it. Their loom &s;eemed to be in one re&s;pect preferable to ours, for the web was not &s;tretched upon a frame, but extended by a piece of wood at each end, round one of which the cloth was rolled, and round the other the threads: the webb was about half a yard broad,
<PB N="185" REF="013324_0474_0F90501B747D4568">
and the length of the &s;huttle was equal to the breadth of the webb, &s;o that probably their work goes on but &s;lowly. That they dyed this cloth we fir&s;t gue&s;&s;ed from its colour, and from the indigo which we &s;aw in their plantations; and our con|jecture was afterwards confirmed by Mr. Lange's account. I have already ob&s;erved, that it is dyed in the yarn, and we once &s;aw them dying what was &s;aid to be girdles for the wo|men, of a dirty red, but with what drug we did not think it worth while to enquire.</P>
<P>The religion of the&s;e people, according to Mr. Lange's in|formation, is an ab&s;urd kind of pagani&s;m, every man chu&s;ing his own god; and determining for him&s;elf how he &s;hould be wor&s;hipped; &s;o that there are almo&s;t as many gods and modes of wor&s;hip as people. In their morals, however, they are &s;aid to be irreproachable, even upon the principles of Chri&s;tianity: no man is allowed more than one wife; yet an illicit com|merce between the &s;exes is in a manner unknown among them: in&s;tances of theft are very rare; and they are &s;o far from re|venging a &s;uppo&s;ed injury by murder, that if any difference ari&s;es between them, they will not &s;o much as make it the &s;ub|ject of debate, le&s;t they &s;hould be provoked to re&s;entment and ill-will, but immediately and implicitly refer it to the deter|mination of their King.</P>
<P>They appeared to be a healthy and long-lived people; yet &s;ome of them were marked with the &s;mall-pox, which Mr. Lange told us had &s;everal times made its appearance among them, and was treated with the &s;ame precautions as the plague. As &s;oon as a per&s;on was &s;eized with the di&s;temper, he was re|moved to &s;ome &s;olitary place, very remote from any habita|tion, where the di&s;ea&s;e was left to take its cour&s;e, and the pa|tient &s;upplied with daily food by reaching it to him at the end of a long pole.</P>
<P>Of their dome&s;tic oeconomy we could learn but little: in one in&s;tance however their delicacy and cleanline&s;s are very remarkable. Many of us were a&s;hore here three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, from a very early hour in the morning till it was dark; yet we never &s;aw the lea&s;t trace of an offering to Cloacina, nor could we &s;o much as gue&s;s where they were made. In a country &s;o populous this is very difficult to be accounted for, and perhaps there is no other country in the world where the &s;ecret is &s;o effectually kept.</P>
<P>The boats in u&s;e here are a kind of proa.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was &s;ettled by the Portugue&s;e almo&s;t as &s;oon as they fir&s;t found their way into this part of the ocean; but they were in a &s;hort time &s;upplanted by the Dutch. The Dutch however did not take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, but only &s;ent &s;loops to trade with the natives, probably for provi&s;ions to &s;upport the inhabitants of their &s;pice i&s;lands, who applying them&s;elves

wholly to the cultivation of that important article of trade, and laying out all their ground in plantations, can breed few ani|mals: po&s;&s;ibly their &s;upplies by this occa&s;ional traffic were precarious; po&s;&s;ibly they were jealous of being &s;upplanted in their turn; but however that be, their Ea&s;t India Company, about ten years ago, entered into a treaty with the Rajas, by which the Company &s;tipulated to furni&s;h each of them with a certain quantity of &s;ilk, fine linen, cutlery ware, arrack and other articles, every year; and the Rajas engaged that neither they nor their &s;ubjects &s;hould trade with any per&s;on except the Company, without having fir&s;t obtained their con&s;ent, and that they would admit a re&s;ident on behalf of the Company, to re&s;ide upon the i&s;land, and &s;ee that their part of the treaty was fulfilled; they al&s;o engaged to &s;upply annually a certain quantity of rice, maize, and calevances. Their maize and calevances are &s;ent to Timor in &s;loops, which are kept there for that purpo&s;e, each of which is navigated by ten Indians; and the rice is fetched away annually by a &s;hip which brings the Company's returns, and anchors alternately in each of the three bays. The&s;e returns are delivered to the Rajas in the form of a pre&s;ent, and the ca&s;k of arrack they and their principal people never cea&s;e to drink, as long as a drop of it remains.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this treaty, the Dutch placed three per|&s;ons upon the i&s;land: Mr. Lange, his colleague, the native of Timor, the &s;on of an Indian woman by a Portugue&s;e, and one Frederick Craig, the &s;on of an Indian woman, by a Dutchman. Lange vi&s;its each of the Rajas in two months, when he makes the tour of the i&s;land, attended by fifty &s;laves on hor&s;eback. He exhorts the&s;e Chiefs to plant, if it appears that they have been remi&s;s, and ob&s;erves where the crops are got in, that he may order &s;loops to fetch it; &s;o that it pa&s;&s;es immediately from the ground to the Dutch &s;torehou&s;es at Timor. In the&s;e excur&s;ions he always carries with him &s;ome bottles of arrack, which he finds of great u&s;e in opening the hearts of the Rajas with whom he is to deal.</P>
<P>During the ten years that he had re&s;ided upon this i&s;land he had never &s;een a European be&s;ides our&s;elves, except at the arrival of the Dutch &s;hip, which had &s;ailed about two months before we arrived; and he is now to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the natives only by his colour and his dre&s;s, for he fits upon the ground, chews his betele, and in every re&s;pect has adopted their character and manners: he has married an Indian woman of the i&s;land of Timor, who keeps his hou&s;e after the fa&s;hion of her country; and he gave that as a rea&s;on for not inviting us to vi&s;it him, &s;aying, that he could entertain us in no other manner than the Indians had done, and he &s;poke no language readily but that of the country.</P>
<P>The office of Mr. Frederic Craig is to in&s;truct the youth of
<PB N="187" REF="013324_0476_0F90F25FC8B64D08">
the country in reading and writing, and the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion; the Dutch having printed ver&s;ions of the New Te&s;tament, a catechi&s;m, and &s;everal other tracts, in the language of this and the neighbouring i&s;lands. Dr. Solan|der, who was at his hou&s;e, &s;aw the books, and the copy books al&s;o, of his &s;cholars, many of whom wrote a very fair hand. He boa&s;ted that there were no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred Chri&s;tians in the town&s;hip of Seba; but what the Dutch Chri&s;tianity of the&s;e Indians may be, it is not perhaps very ea&s;y to gue&s;s for there is not a church, nor even a prie&s;t, in the whole i&s;land.</P>
<P>While we were at this place, we made &s;everal enquiries concerning the neighbouring i&s;lands, and the intelligence which we received, is to the following effect:</P>
<P>A &s;mall i&s;land to the we&s;tward of Savu, the name of which we did not learn, produces nothing of any con&s;equence but areca-nuts, of which the Dutch receive annually the freight of two &s;loops, in return for pre&s;ents that they make to the i&s;landers.</P>
<P>Timor is the chief, and the Dutch re&s;idents on the other i&s;lands go thither once a year to pa&s;s their accounts. The place is nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate as in Dampier's time, the Dutch having there a fort and &s;tore-hou&s;es; and, by Lange's account, we might there have been &s;upplied with every nece&s;|&s;ary that we expected to procure at Batavia, &s;alt provi&s;ions and arrack not excepted. But the Portugue&s;e are &s;till in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal towns on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land, parti|cularly Laphoa and Se&s;ial.</P>
<P>About two years before our arrival, a French &s;hip was wrecked upon the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Timor; and after &s;he had lain &s;ome days upon the &s;hoal, a &s;udden gale broke her up at once, and drowned the Captain, with the greate&s;t part of the crew: tho&s;e who got a&s;hore, among whom was one of the Lieute|nants, made the be&s;t of their way to Concordia; they were four days upon the road, where they were obliged to leave part of their company through fatigue, and the re&s;t to the number of about eighty, arrived at the town. They were &s;upplied with every nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ent back to the wreck, with pro|per a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for recovering what could be fi&s;hed up; they fortunately got up all their bullion, which was in che&s;ts, and &s;everal of their guns which were very large. They then re|turned to the town, but their companions who had been left upon the road were mi&s;&s;ing, having, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, been kept among the Indians, either by per&s;ua&s;ion or force; for they are very de&s;irous of having Europeans among them, to in&s;truct them in the art of war. After a &s;tay of more than two months at Concordia, their number was dimini&s;hed near|ly one half by &s;ickne&s;s, in con&s;equence of the fatigue and
<PB N="188" REF="013324_0477_0F90F260ACC2FFE8">
hard&s;hip which they had &s;uffered by the &s;hipwreck, and the &s;urvivors were &s;ent in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to Europe.</P>
<P>Rotte is in much the &s;ame &s;ituation as Savu; a Dutch fac|tor re&s;ides upon it to manage the natives, and look after its produce, which con&s;i&s;ts among other articles, of &s;ugar. For|merly it was made only by brui&s;ing the canes, and boiling the juice to a &s;yrup, in the &s;ame manner as Toddy; but great improvements have lately been made in preparing this valu|able commodity. The three little i&s;lands called the Solars are al&s;o under the influence of the Dutch &s;ettlement at Con|cordia: they are flat and low, but abound with provi&s;ions of every kind, and the middlemo&s;t is &s;aid to have a good har|bour for &s;hipping. Ende, another little i&s;land to the we&s;tward of the Solars, is &s;till in the hands of the Portugue&s;e, who have a good town and harbour on the north ea&s;t corner of it, called Larntuca: they had formerly an harbour on the &s;outh &s;ide of it, but that being much inferior to Larntuca, has for &s;ome time been altogether neglected.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of each of the&s;e little i&s;lands &s;peak a lan|guage peculiar to them&s;elves, and it is an object of Dutch po|licy to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible, their learning the lan|guage of each other. If they &s;poke a common language, they would learn, by mutual intercour&s;e with each other, to plant &s;uch things as would be of more value to them&s;elves than their pre&s;ent produce, though of le&s;s advantage to the Dutch; but their languages being different, they can communicate no &s;uch knowlege to each other, and the Dutch &s;ecure to them|&s;elves the benefit of &s;upplying their &s;everal nece&s;&s;ities upon their own terms, which it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e are not ve|ry moderate. It is probable with a view to this advantage that the Dutch never teach their own language to the natives of the&s;e i&s;lands, and have been at the expence of tran&s;lating the Te&s;tament and catechi&s;ms into the different languages of each; for in proportion as Dutch had become the language of their religion, it would have become the common language of them all.</P>
<P>To this account of Savu, I &s;hall only add a &s;mall &s;pecimen of its language, by which it will appear to have &s;ome affinity with that of the South Sea i&s;lands, many of the words being exactly the &s;ame, and the numbers manife&s;tly derived from the &s;ame &s;ource.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The Run from the I&s;land of Savu to Batavia, and an Account of the Tran&s;actions there, while the Ship was refitting.</HEAD>
<P>IN the morning of Friday the 21&s;t of September, 1770, we got under &s;ail, and &s;tood away to the we&s;tward, along the north &s;ide of the i&s;land of Savu, and of the &s;maller that lies to the we&s;tward of it, which at noon bore from us S. S. E. di&s;tant two leagues. At four o'clock in the afternoon, we di&s;covered a &s;mall low i&s;land, bearing S. S. W. di&s;tant three leagues, which has no place in any chart now extant, at lea&s;t in none that I have been able to procure: it lies in lati|tude 10&deg; 47&prime; S., longitude 238&deg; 28&prime; W.</P>
<P>At noon on the 22d, we were in latitude 11&deg; 10&prime; S., longi|tude 240&deg; 38&prime; W. In the evening of the 23d, we found the variation of the needle to be 2&deg; 44&prime; W.; as &s;oon as we got clear of the i&s;lands we had con&s;tantly a &s;well from the &s;outh|ward, which I imagined was not cau&s;ed by a wind blowing from that quarter, but by the &s;ea being &s;o determined by the po&s;ition of the coa&s;t of New Holland.</P>
<P>At noon on the 26th, being in latitude 10&deg; 47&prime; S., longi|tude 249&deg; 52&prime; W. we found the variation to be 3&deg; 10&prime; W. and our &s;ituation to be twenty-five miles to the northward of the log; for which I know not how to account. At noon on the 27th, our latitude by ob&s;ervation was 10&deg; 51&prime; S. which was
<PB N="191" REF="013324_0480_0F90F262C490EA30">
agreeable to the log; and our longitude was 252&deg; 11&prime; W. We &s;teered N. W. all day on the 28th, in order to make the land of Java; and at noon on the 29th, our latitude by ob|&s;ervation was 9&deg; 31&prime; S., longitude 254&deg; 10&prime; W.; and in the morning of the 30th, I took into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the log-book and journals, at lea&s;t all I could find, of the officers, petty officers, and &s;eamen, and enjoined them &s;ecrecy with re&s;pect to where they had been.</P>
<P>At &s;even in the evening, being in the latitude of Java Head, and not &s;eeing any land, I concluded that we were too far to the we&s;tward: I therefore hauled up E. N. E. having be|fore &s;teered N. by E. In the night we had thunder and light|ning; and about twelve o'clock, by the light of the fla&s;hes, we &s;aw the land bearing ea&s;t. I then tacked and &s;tood to the S. W. till four o'clock in the morning of the fir&s;t of October; and at &s;ix, Java Head, or the we&s;t end of Java, bore S. E. by E. di&s;tant five leagues: &s;oon after we &s;aw Prince's I&s;land, bearing E. &frac12; S.; and at ten, the i&s;land of Cracatoa, bearing N. E. Cracatoa is a remarkably high-peaked i&s;land, and at noon it bore N. 40 E. di&s;tant &s;even leagues.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now ob&s;erve that, during our run from Savu, I al|lowed twenty minutes a day for the we&s;terly current, which I concluded mu&s;t run &s;trong at this time, e&s;pecially off the coa&s;t of Java, and I found that this allowance was ju&s;t equivalent to the effect of the current upon the &s;hip.</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the morning of the 2d, we fetched clo&s;e in with the coa&s;t of Java, in fifteen fathom; we then &s;tood, along the coa&s;t, and early in the forenoon, I &s;ent the boat a&s;hore to try if &s;he could procure &s;ome fruit for Tupia, who was very ill, and &s;ome gra&s;s for the buffaloes that were &s;till alive. In an hour or two &s;he returned with four cocoa-nuts, and a &s;mall bunch of plantains, which had been purcha&s;ed for a &s;hilling, and &s;ome herbage for the cattle, which the In|dians not only gave us, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted our people to cut. The country looked like one continued wood, and had a very plea|&s;ant appearance.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock, we &s;aw two Dutch &s;hips lying off Anger point, and I &s;ent Mr. Hicks on board one of them, to enquire news of our country, from which we had been ab&s;ent &s;o long. In the mean time it fell calm, and about noon I anchored in eighteen fathom with a muddy bottom. When Mr. Hicks returned, he reported that the &s;hips were Dutch Ea&s;t Indiamen from Batavia, one of which was bound to Cey|lon, and the other to the coa&s;t of Malabar; and that there was al&s;o a flyboat or packet, which was &s;aid to be &s;tationed here to carry letters from the Dutch &s;hips that came hither to Batavia, but which I rather think was appointed to examine all &s;hips that pa&s;s the &s;treight: from the&s;e &s;hips we heard
<PB N="192" REF="013324_0481_0F90F26376830C30">
with great plea&s;ure, that the Swallow had been at Batavia about two years before.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock a breeze &s;prung up at S. S. W. with which having weighed, we &s;tood to the N. E. between Thwart-the-way-I&s;land and the Cap, &s;ounding from eighteen to twenty-eight fathom: we had but little wind all night, and having a &s;trong current again&s;t us, we got no further by eight in the morning than Bantam Point. At this time the wind came to the N. E. and obliged us to anchor in two and twenty fathom, at about the di&s;tance of two miles from the &s;hore; the point bore N. E. by E. di&s;tant one league, and here we found a &s;trong current &s;etting to the N. W. In the morning we had &s;een the Dutch packet &s;tanding after us, but when the wind &s;hifted to the N. E. &s;he bore away.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the evening, the wind having obliged us to continue at anchor, one of the country boats came along &s;ide of us, on board of which was the ma&s;ter of the packet. He &s;eemed to have two motives for his vi&s;it, one to take an account of the &s;hip, and the other to &s;ell us refre&s;hments; for in the boat were turtle, fowls, ducks, parrots, paroq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ets, rice-birds, monkies, and other articles, which they held at a very high price, and brought to a bad market, for our Savu &s;tock was not yet expended: however, I gave a Spani&s;h dol|lar for a &s;mall turtle, which weighed about &s;ix and thirty pounds; I gave al&s;o a dollar for ten large fowls, and after|wards bought fifteen more at the &s;ame price; for a dollar we might al&s;o have bought two monkies, or a whole cage of rice|birds. The Ma&s;ter of the &s;loop brought with him two books, in one of which he de&s;ired that any of our officers would write down the name of the &s;hip and its commander, with that of the place from which &s;he &s;ailed, and of the port to which &s;he was bound, with &s;uch other particulars relating to them&s;elves, as they might think proper, for the information of any of our friends that &s;hould come after us: and in the other he entered the names of the &s;hip and the Commander him&s;elf, in order to tran&s;mit them to the Governor and Council of the Indies. We perceived that in the fir&s;t book many &s;hips, particularly Portugue&s;e, had made entries of the &s;ame kind with that for which it was pre&s;ented to us. Mr. Hicks, however, having written the name of the &s;hip, only added "from Europe." He took notice of this, but &s;aid, that he was &s;atisfied with any thing we thought fit to write, it being intended merely for the information of tho&s;e who &s;hould enquire after us from motives of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Having made &s;everal attempts to &s;ail with a wind that would not &s;tem the current, and as often come to an anchor, a proa came along &s;ide of us in the morning of the 5th, in which was a Dutch officer, who &s;ent me down a printed paper

in Engli&s;h, duplicates of which he had in other languages, particularly in French and Dutch, all regularly &s;igned, in the name of the Governor and Council of the Indies, by their &s;e|cretary: it contained nine que&s;tions, very ill expre&s;&s;ed in the following terms:</P>

<P>Of the&s;e que&s;tions I an&s;wered only the fir&s;t and the fourth; which when the officer &s;aw, he &s;aid an&s;wers to the re&s;t were of no con&s;equence: yet he immediately added, that he mu&s;t &s;end that very paper away to Batavia, and that it would be there the next day at noon. I have particularly related this incident, becau&s;e I have been credibly informed that it is but of late years that the Dutch have taken upon them to examine &s;hips that pa&s;s through this Streight.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock the &s;ame morning, we weighed, with a light breeze at S. W.; but did little more than &s;tem the current, and about two o'clock anchored again under Bantam Point, where we lay till nine; a light breeze then &s;pringing up at S. E. we weighed and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward till ten o'clock the next morn|ing, when the current obliged us again to anchor in twenty-two fathom, Pulababi bearing E. by S. &frac12; S. di&s;tant between three and four miles. Having alternately weighed and anchored &s;everal times, till four in the afternoon of the 7th, we then &s;tood to the ea&s;tward, with a very faint breeze at N. E. and pa&s;&s;ed Wapping I&s;land, and the fir&s;t i&s;land to the ea&s;tward of it; when the wind dying away, we were carried by the current between the fir&s;t and &s;econd of the i&s;lands that lie to the ea&s;t|ward of Wapping I&s;land, where we were obliged to anchor in thirty fathom, being very near a ledge of rocks that run out from one of the i&s;lands. At two the next morning we weighed

with the land wind at &s;outh, and &s;tood out clear of the &s;hoal; but before noon were obliged to come to again in twenty-eight fathom, near a &s;mall i&s;land among tho&s;e that are called the Thou&s;and I&s;lands, which we did not find laid down in any chart. Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Pare at this time bore E. N. E. di&s;tance between &s;ix and &s;even miles.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went a&s;hore upon the i&s;land, which they found not to be more than five hundred yards long, and one hundred broad; yet there was a hou&s;e upon it, and a &s;mall plantation, where among other things was the <HI>Palma Chri&s;ti,</HI> from which the ca&s;tor oil is made in the We&s;t Indies: they made a &s;mall addition to their collection of plants, and &s;hot a bat, who&s;e wings when extended mea&s;ured three feet from point to point: they &s;hot al&s;o four plovers, which exactly re&s;embled the golden plover of England. Soon after they re|turned, a &s;mall Indian boat came along&s;ide with two Malaya on board, who brought three turtles, &s;ome dried fi&s;h, and a few pumpkins: we bought the turtle, which altogether weighed a hundred and forty-&s;ix pounds, for a dollar, and con&s;idering that we had lately paid the Dutchman a dollar for one that weighed only &s;ix and thirty pounds, we thought we had a good bargain. The &s;eller appeared equally &s;atisfied, and we then treated with him for his pumpkins, for which he was very un|willing to take any money but a dollar; we &s;aid that a whole dollar was greatly too much; to which he readily a&s;&s;ented, but de&s;ired that we would cut one and give him a part: at la&s;t, however, a fine &s;hining Portugue&s;e petacka tempted him, and for that he &s;old us his whole &s;tock of pumpkins, being in number twenty-&s;ix. At parting, he made &s;igns that we &s;hould not tell at Batavia that any boat had been aboard us.</P>
<P>We were not able to weather Pulo Pare this day, but getting the land wind at &s;outh about ten o'clock at night, we weighed and &s;tood to the E. S. E. all night. At ten in the morning, we anchored again, to wait for the &s;ea breeze; and at noon it &s;prung up at N. N. E. with which we &s;tood in for Batavia road, where at four o'clock in the afternoon we came to an anchor.</P>
<P>We found here the Harcourt Indiaman from England, two Engli&s;h private traders of that country, thirteen &s;ail of large Dutch &s;hips, and a con&s;iderable number of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. A boat came immediately on board, from a &s;hip which had a broad pendant flying, and the officer who commanded having enquired who we were, and whence we came, immediately re|turned with &s;uch an&s;wers as we thought fit to give him: both he and his people were as pale as &s;pectres, a &s;ad pre&s;age of our &s;ufferings in &s;o unhealthy a country; but our people, who, except Tupia, were all ro&s;y and plump, &s;eemed to think them|&s;elves &s;o &s;ea&s;oned by various climates that nothing could hurt them. In the mean time, I &s;ent a Lieutenant a&s;hore to acquaint
<PB N="195" REF="013324_0484_0F90F2652B389B10">
the Governor of our arrival, and to make an excu&s;e for our not &s;aluting; for as I could &s;alute with only three guns, except the &s;wivels, which I was of opinion would not be heard, I thought it was better to let it alone. As &s;oon as the boat was di&s;patched the carpenter delivered me an account of the defects of the &s;hip, of which the following is a copy:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The defects of his Maje&s;ty's bark Endeavour, Lieutenant James Cook, Commander.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hip very leaky, as &s;he makes from twelve to &s;ix inches water an hour, occa&s;ioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, and the &s;carfs of her &s;tern being very open: the fal&s;e keel gone beyond the mid&s;hips from forward, and perhaps farther; as I had no opportunity of &s;eeing for the water when hauled a&s;hore for repairing: wounded on the larboard &s;ide under the main channel, where I imagine the greate&s;t leak is, but could not come at it for the water: one pump on the larboard &s;ide u&s;ele&s;s; the others decayed within an inch and a half of the bore. Otherwi&s;e ma&s;ts, yards, boats, and hull, in pretty good condition.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>As it was the univer&s;al opinion that the &s;hip could not &s;afely proceed to Europe without an examination of her bottom, I de|termined to apply for leave to heave her down at this place; and as I under&s;tood that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to make this ap|plication in writing, I drew up a reque&s;t, and the next morn|ing, having got it tran&s;lated into Dutch, we all went a&s;hore.</P>
<P>We repaired immediately to the hou&s;e of Mr. Leith, the only Engli&s;hman of any credit who is re&s;ident at this place, he re|ceived us with great politene&s;s, and engaged us to dinner: to this gentleman we applied for in&s;tructions how to provide our|&s;elves with lodgings and nece&s;&s;aries while we &s;hould &s;tay a&s;hore, and he told us, that there was a hotel, or kind of inn, kept by the order of government, where all merchants and &s;trangers were obliged to re&s;ide, paying half per cent upon the value of their goods for warehou&s;e room, which the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was obliged to provide; but that as we came in a King's &s;hip, we &s;hould be at liberty to live where we plea&s;ed, upon a&s;king the Governor's permi&s;&s;ion, which would be granted of cour&s;e. He &s;aid, that it would be cheaper for us to take a hou&s;e in the town, and bring our own &s;ervants a&s;hore, if we had any body upon whom we could depend to buy in our provi&s;ions; but as this was not the ca&s;e, having no per&s;on among us who could &s;peak the Malay language, our gentlemen determined to go to the hotel. At the hotel, therefore, beds were immediately hired, and word was &s;ent that we &s;hould &s;leep there at night.</P>
<P>At five o'clock in the afternoon, I was introduced to the Governor-General, who received my very courteou&s;ly; he told me, that I &s;hould have every thing I wanted, and that in the morning my reque&s;t &s;hould be laid before the council, which I was de&s;ired to attend.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="013324_0485_0F90F1C08DDCCC30">
About nine o'clock, we had a dreadful &s;torm of thunder, lightning, and rain, during which the main-ma&s;t of one of the Dutch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t Indiamen was &s;plit, and carried away by the deck; the main-top-ma&s;t and top-gallant-ma&s;t were &s;hivered all to pieces; &s;he had an iron &s;pindle at the main-top-gallant-ma&s;t-head, which probably directed the &s;troke. This &s;hip lay not more than the di&s;tance of two cables length from ours, and in all probability we &s;hould have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, but for the electrical chain which we had but ju&s;t got up, and which con|ducted the lightning over the &s;ide of the &s;hip; but though we e&s;caped the lightning, the explo&s;ion &s;hook us like an earth|quake, the chain at the &s;ame time appearing like a line of fire: a centinel was in the action of charging his piece, and the &s;hock forced the mu&s;quet out of his hand, and broke the rammer rod. Upon this occa&s;ion, I cannot but earne&s;tly re|commend chains of the &s;ame kind to every &s;hip, whatever be her de&s;tination, and I hope that the fate of the Dutchman will be a warning to all who &s;hall read this narrative, again&s;t hav|ing an iron &s;pindle at the ma&s;t-head.</P>
<P>The next morning, I attended at the council-chamber, and was told that I &s;hould have every thing I wanted. In the mean time, the gentlemen a&s;hore agreed with the keeper of the hotel for their lodging and board, at the rate of two rix-dollars, or nine &s;hillings &s;terling a day for each; and as there were five of them, and they would probably have many vi&s;itors from the &s;hip, he agreed to keep them a &s;eparate table, upon condition that they &s;hould pay one rix-dollar for the dinner of every &s;tranger, and another for his &s;upper and bed, if he &s;hould &s;leep a&s;hore. Under this &s;tipulation they were to be furni&s;hed with tea, coffee, punch, pipes and tobacco, for them&s;elves and their friends, as much as they could con&s;ume; they were al&s;o to pay half a rupee, or one &s;hilling and three pence a day for each of their &s;ervants.</P>
<P>They &s;oon learnt that the&s;e rates were more than double the common charges of board and lodging in the town, and their table, though it had the appearance of magnificence, was wretchedly &s;erved. Their dinner con&s;i&s;ted of one cour&s;e of fifteen di&s;hes, and then &s;upper of one cour&s;e of thirteen, but nine or ten of them con&s;i&s;ted of bad poultry, variou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed, and often &s;erved up the &s;econd, third, and even the fourth time: the &s;ame duck having appeared more than once roa&s;ted, found his way again to the table as a frica&s;ee, and a fourth time in the form of forced meat. It was not long, however, before they learnt that this treatment was only by way of e&s;&s;ay, and that it was the invariable cu&s;tom of the hou&s;e, to &s;upply all &s;trangers, at their fir&s;t coming, with &s;uch fare as could be procured for the lea&s;t money, and con&s;equently would produce the mo&s;t gain: that if either through indolence or good-nature they

wore content, it was continued for the benefit of the ho&s;t, but that if they complained, it was gradually amended till they were &s;atisfied, which &s;ometimes happened before they had the worth of their money. After this di&s;covery, they remon&s;trated, and their fare became better; however, after a few days, Mr. Banks hired a little hou&s;e, the next door on the left hand to the hotel, for him&s;elf and his party, for which he paid after the rate of ten rix-dollars, or two pounds five &s;hillings &s;terling a month; but here they were very far from having either the convenience or the privacy which they expected; no per&s;on was permitted to &s;leep in this private hou&s;e occa&s;ionally, as a gue&s;t to the per&s;on who hired it, under a penalty, but almo&s;t every Dutchman that went by ran in without any ceremony, to a&s;k what they &s;old, there having been very &s;eldom any private per&s;ons at Batavia who had not &s;omething to &s;ell. Every body here hires a carriage, and Mr. Banks hired two. They are open chai&s;es, made to hold two people, and driven by a man &s;itting on a coach-box; for each of the&s;e he paid two rix-dollars a day.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was &s;ettled in his new habitation, he &s;ent for Tupia, who till now had continued on board upon account of his illne&s;s, which was of the bilious kind, and for which he had ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to take any medicine. He &s;oon came a&s;hore, with his boy Tayeto, and though while he was on board, and after he came into the boat, he was exceedingly li&s;tle&s;s and dejected, he no &s;ooner entered the town than h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eemed to animated with a new &s;oul. The hou&s;es, carriages, &s;treets, people, and a multiplicity of other objects, all new, which ru&s;hed upon him at once, produced an effect like the &s;udden and &s;ecret power that is imagined of fa&s;cination. Tayeto expre&s;&s;ed his wonder and delight with &s;till le&s;s re&s;traint, and danced along the &s;treet in a kind of exta&s;y, examining every object with a re&s;tle&s;s and eager curio&s;ity, which was every moment excited and gratified. One of the fir&s;t things that Tupia remarked, was the various dre&s;&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ing multi|tude, concerning which he made many enquiries; and when he was told that in this place, where people of many different nations were a&s;&s;embled, every one wore the habit of his country, he de&s;ired that he might conform to the cu&s;tom, and appear in that of Otaheite. South Sea cloth was therefore &s;ent for from the &s;hip, and he equipped him&s;elf with great expedition and dexterity. The people who had &s;een Otourou, the Indian who had been brought hither by M. Bougainville, enquired whether Tupia was not the &s;ame per&s;on; from the&s;e enquiries, we learnt who it was that we had &s;uppo&s;ed to be Spaniards, from the accounts that had been given of two &s;hips by the I&s;landers.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I procured an order to the &s;uperintendant
<PB N="198" REF="013324_0487_0F90F1C1FAAAD450">
of the i&s;land of Ouru&s;t, where the &s;hip was to be repaired, to receive her there; and &s;ent by one of the &s;hips that &s;ailed for Holland, an account of our arrival here, to Mr. Stephens, the Secretary to the Admiralty.</P>
<P>The expences that would be incurred by repairing and re|fitting the &s;hip, rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for me to take up money in this place, which I imagined might be done without difficul|ty, but I found my&s;elf mi&s;taken; for after the mo&s;t diligent enquiry, I could not find any private per&s;on that had ability and inclination to advance the &s;um that I wanted. In this difficulty I applied to the Governor him&s;elf, by a written reque&s;t, in con&s;equence of which, the Shebander had orders to &s;upply me with what money I &s;hould require out of the Company's Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>On the 18th, as &s;oon as it was light, having by &s;everal acci|dents and mi&s;takes &s;uffered a delay of many days, I took up the anchor, and ran down to Ouru&s;t: a few days afterwards, we went along-&s;ide of the wharf, on Cooper's I&s;land, which lies clo&s;e to Ouru&s;t, in order to take out our &s;tores.</P>
<P>By this time, having been here only nine days, we began to feel the fatal effects of the climate and &s;ituation. Tupia, after the flow of &s;pirits which the novelties of the place produced upon his fir&s;t landing, &s;unk on a &s;udden, and grew every day wor&s;e and wor&s;e. Tayeto was &s;eized with an inflammation upon his lungs, Mr. Banks's two &s;ervants became very ill, and him&s;elf and Dr. Solander were attacked by fevers: in a few days, almo&s;t every per&s;on both on board and a&s;hore was &s;ick; affected, no doubt, by the low &s;wampy &s;ituation of the place, and the numberle&s;s dirty canals which inter&s;ect the town in all directions. On the 26th, I &s;et up the tent for the reception of the &s;hip's company, of whom there was but a &s;mall number able to do duty. Poor Tupia, of who&s;e life we now began to de&s;pair, and who till this time had continued a&s;hore with Mr. Banks, de&s;ired to be removed to the &s;hip, where, he &s;aid, he &s;hould breathe a freer air than among the numerous hou&s;es which ob&s;tructed it a&s;hore: on board the &s;hip, however, he could not go, for &s;he was unrigged, and preparing to be laid down at the careening place; but on the 28th, Mr. Banks went with him to Cooper's I&s;land, or, as it is called here, Kuypor, where &s;he lay, and as he &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the &s;pot, a tent was there pitched for him: at this place, both the &s;ea breeze and the land breeze blew directly over him, and he expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction in his &s;ituation. Mr. Banks, who&s;e huma|nity kept him two days with this poor Indian, returned to the town on the 30th, and the fits of his intermittent, which was now become a regular tertian, were &s;o violent as to deprive him of his &s;en&s;es while they la&s;ted, and leave him &s;o weak that he was &s;carcely able to crawl down &s;tairs: at this time, Dr.

<P>On the fifth of November, after many delays in con&s;equence of the Dutch &s;hips coming along-&s;ide the wharfs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> load pepper, the &s;hip was laid down, and the &s;ame day, Mr. Monkhou&s;e, our Surgeon, a &s;en&s;ible, &s;killful man, fell the fir&s;t &s;acrifice to this fatal country, a lo&s;s which was greatly aggravated by our &s;ituation. Dr. Solander was ju&s;t able to attend his funeral, but Mr. Banks was confined to his bed. Our di&s;tre&s;s was now very great, and the pro&s;pect before us di&s;couraging in the highe&s;t degree: our danger was not &s;uch as we could &s;urmount by any efforts of our own; courage, &s;kill, and diligence were all equally ineffectual, and death was every day making ad|vances upon us, where we could neither re&s;i&s;t nor fly. Malay &s;ervants were hired to attend the &s;ick, but they had &s;o little &s;en&s;e either of duty or humanity, that they could not be kept within call, and the patient was frequently obliged to get out of bed to &s;eek them. On the 9th, we lo&s;t our poor Indian boy Tayeto, and Tupia was &s;o much affected, that it was doubted whether he would &s;urvive till the next day.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the bottom of the &s;hip being examined, was found to be in a wor&s;e condition than we apprehended: the fal&s;e keel was all gone to within twenty feet of the &s;tern po&s;t; the main keel was con&s;iderably injured in many places; a great quantity of the &s;heating was torn off, and &s;everal planks were much damaged; two of them, and the half of a third, under the main channel near the keel, were, for the length of &s;ix feet, &s;o worn, that they were not above an eight part of an inch thick, and here the worms had made their way quite into the timbers; yet in this condition &s;he had &s;ailed many hundred leagues, where navigation is as dangerous as in any part of the world: how much mi&s;ery did we e&s;cape, by being ignorant that &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el was thinner than the &s;ole of a &s;hoe, and that every life on board depended upon &s;o &s;light and fragile a barrier between us and the un|fathomable ocean! It &s;eemed, however, that we had been pre|&s;erved only to peri&s;h here; Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were &s;o bad that the phy&s;ician declared they had no chance for re|covery but by removing into the country; a hou&s;e was therefore hired for them, at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the town, which belonged to the ma&s;ter of the hotel, who engaged to furni&s;h them with provi&s;ions, and the u&s;e of &s;laves. As they had already experienced their want of influence over &s;laves that had other ma&s;ters, and the unfeeling inattention of the&s;e fellows to the &s;ick, they bought each of them a Mallay woman, which removed both the cau&s;es of their being &s;o ill &s;erved; the women were their own property, and the tenderne&s;s of the &s;ex, even here, made them good nur&s;es. While the&s;e preparations were
<PB N="200" REF="013324_0489_0F90F1C450CDDD58">
making, they received an account of the death of Tupia, who &s;unk at once after the lo&s;s of the boy, whom he loved with the tenderne&s;s of a parent.</P>
<P>By the 14th, the bottom of the &s;hip was thorougly repaired, and very much to my &s;atisfaction: it would, indeed, be in|ju&s;tice to the officers and workmen of this yard, not to declare that, in my opinion, there is not a marine yard in the world, where a &s;hip can be laid down with more convenience, &s;afety, and di&s;patch, nor repaired with more diligence and &s;kill. At this place they heave down by two ma&s;ts, a method which we do not now practi&s;e; it is, however, unque&s;tionably more &s;afe and expeditious to heave down with two ma&s;ts than one, and he mu&s;t have a good &s;hare of bigotry to old cu&s;toms, and an equal want of common &s;en&s;e, who will not allow this, after &s;eeing with what facility the Dutch heave down their large&s;t &s;hips at this place.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander recovered &s;lowly at their coun|try-hou&s;e, which was not only open to the &s;ea breeze, but &s;ituated upon a running &s;tream, which greatly contributed to the circulation of the air: but I was now taken ill my&s;elf; Mr. Sporing, and a &s;eaman who had attended Mr. Banks, were al&s;o &s;eized with intermittents; and indeed there was not more than ten of the whole &s;hip's company that were able to do duty.</P>
<P>We proceeded however in rigging the &s;hip, and getting water and &s;tores aboard: the water we were obliged to procure from Batavia, at the rate of &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence a leager, or one hundred and fifty gallons.</P>
<P>About the 26th, the we&s;terly mon&s;oon &s;et in, which gene|rally blows here in the night from the S. W. and in the day from the N. W. or N. For &s;ome nights before this, we had very heavy rain, with much thunder; and in the night between the 25th and 26th, &s;uch rain as we had &s;eldom &s;een, for near four hours without intermi&s;&s;ion. Mr. Banks's hou&s;e admitted the water in every part like a &s;ieve, and it ran through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ower rooms in a &s;tream that would have turned a mill: he was by this time &s;ufficiently recovered to go out, and upon his enter|ing Batavia the next morning, he was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the bedding every where hung out to dry.</P>
<P>The wet &s;ea&s;on was now &s;et in, though we had &s;ome inter|vals of fair weather. The frogs in the ditches, which croak ten times louder than any frogs in Europe, gave notice of rain by an ince&s;&s;ant noi&s;e that was almo&s;t intolerable, and the gnats and mu&s;quitos, which had been very trouble&s;ome even during the dry weather, were now become innumerable, &s;warming from every pla&s;h of water like bees from a hive; they did not, however, much incommode us in the day, and the &s;tings, however trouble&s;ome at fir&s;t, never continued to itch above half an hour, &s;o that none of us felt in the day, the effects of the wounds they had received in the night.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="013324_0490_0F8FFB58A5B2AE38">
On the 8th of December, the &s;hip being perfectly refitted, and having taken in mo&s;t of her water and &s;tores, and received her &s;ick on board, we ran up to Batavia Road, and anchored in four fathom and an half water.</P>
<P>From this time, to the 24th, we were employed in getting on board the remainder of our water and provi&s;ions, with &s;ome new pumps, and in &s;everal other operations that were nece&s;&s;ary to fit the &s;hip for the &s;ea, all which would have been effected much &s;ooner, if &s;ickne&s;s and death had not di&s;abled or carried off a great number of our men.</P>
<P>While we lay here, the Earl of Elgin, Captain Cook, a &s;hip belonging to the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India Company, came to an anchor in the Road. She was bound from Madrafs to China, but having lo&s;t her pa&s;&s;age, put in here to wait for the next &s;ea&s;on. The Phoenix, Captain Black, an Engli&s;h country &s;hip, from Bencoolen, al&s;o came to an anchor at this place.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of Chri&s;tmas eve, the 24th, I took leave of the Governor, and &s;everal of the principal gentlemen of the place, with whom I had formed connections, and from whom I received every po&s;&s;ible civility and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but in the mean time an accident happened, which might have produced di&s;|agreeable con&s;equences. A &s;eaman had run away from one of the Dutch &s;hips in the Road, and entered on board of mine: the Captain had applied to the Governor, to reclaim him as a &s;ubject of Holland, and an order for that purpo&s;e was procured: this order was brought to me &s;oon after I returned from my la&s;t vi&s;it, and I &s;aid, that if the man appeared to be a Dutchman, he &s;hould certainly be delivered up. Mr. Hicks commanded on board, and I gave the Dutch officer an order to him, to de|liver the man up under that condition; I &s;lept my&s;elf this night on &s;hore, and in the morning, the Captain of the Dutch Com|modore came and told me that he had carried my order on board, but that the officer had refu&s;ed to deliver up the man, alleging, not only that he was not a Dutchman, but that he was a &s;ubject of Great Britain, born in Ireland; I replied, that the officer had perfectly executed my orders, and that if the man was an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, it could not be expected that I &s;hould deliver him up. The Captain then &s;aid, that he was ju&s;t come from the Governor, to demand the man of me in his name, as a &s;ubject of Denmark, alleging, that he &s;tood in the &s;hip's books as born at El&s;ineur. The claim of this man as a &s;ubject of Holland, being now given up, I ob&s;erved to the Captain, that there appeared to be &s;ome mi&s;take in the Gene|ral's me&s;&s;age, for that he would certainly never demand a Dani&s;h &s;eaman from me, who had committed no other crime than preferring the &s;ervice of the Engli&s;h to that of the Dutch. I added, however, to convince him of my &s;incere de&s;ire to avoid di&s;putes, that if the man was a Dane he &s;hould be de|livered
<PB N="202" REF="013324_0491_0F8FFB594B3727A0">
up as a courte&s;y, though he could not be demanded as a right; but that if I found he was an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, I would keep him at all events. Upon the&s;e terms we parted, and &s;oon after I received a letter from Mr. Hicks, containing indutiable proof that the &s;eaman in que&s;tion was a &s;ubject of his Britannic Maje&s;ty. This letter I immediately carried to the Shebander, with a reque&s;t that it might be &s;hewn to the Governor, and that his Excellency might at the &s;ame time be told, I would not upon any terms part with the man. This had the de&s;ired effect, and I heard no more of the affair.</P>
<P>In the evening, I went on board, accompanied by Mr. Banks, and the re&s;t of the gentlemen who had con&s;tantly re|&s;ided on &s;hore, and who, though better, were not yet per|fectly recovered.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning, of the 26th, we weighed and &s;et &s;ail, with a light breeze at S. W. The Elgin Indiaman &s;aluted us with three cheers and thirteen g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, and the garri&s;on with fourteen, both which, with the help of our &s;wivels, we returned, and &s;oon after the &s;ea breeze &s;et in at N. by W. which obliged us to anchor ju&s;t without the &s;hips in the Road.</P>
<P>At this time, the number of &s;ick on board amounted to forty, and the re&s;t of the &s;hip's company were in a very feeble con|dition. Every individual had been &s;ick except the &s;ail-maker, an old man between &s;eventy and eighty years of age, and it is very remarkable that this old man, during our &s;tay at this place, was con&s;tantly drunk every day: we had burried &s;even, the &s;urgeon, three &s;eamen, Mr. Green's &s;ervant, Tupia, and Tayeto his boy. All but Tupia fell a &s;acrifice to the unwhole&s;ome, &s;tagnant, putrid air of the country, and he who from his birth had been u&s;ed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly upon vegetable food, particu|larly ripe fruit, &s;oon contracted all the di&s;orders that are inci|dene to a &s;ea life, and would probably have &s;unk under them before we could have completed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r voyage, if we had not been obliged to go to Batavia to refit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Some Account of Batavia, and the adjacent Country; with their Fruits, Flowers, and other Productions.</HEAD>
<P>BATAVIA, the capital of the Dutch dominions in India, and generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have no equal among all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Europeans in A&s;ia, is &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land of Java, in a low fenny plain, where &s;everal &s;mall rivers, which take their ri&s;e in the mountains called Blaeuwen Berg, about forty miles up the country, empty them|&s;elves
<PB N="203" REF="013324_0492_0F904FD1A7672498">
into the &s;ea, and where the coa&s;t forms a large bay, called the Bay of Batavia, at the di&s;tance of about eight leagues from the &s;treight of Sunda. It lies in latitude 6&deg; 10&prime; S. and longi|tude 106&deg; 50&prime; E. from the meridian of Greenwich, as appears from a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations made upon the &s;pot, by the Reverend Mr. Mohr, who has built an elegant ob&s;ervatory, which is as well furni&s;hed with in&s;truments as mo&s;t in Europe.</P>
<P>The Dutch &s;eem to have pitched upon this &s;pot for the con|venience of water-carriage, and in that it is indeed a &s;econd Holland, and &s;uperior to every other place in the world. There are very few &s;treets that have not a canal of con&s;iderable breadth running through them, or rather &s;tagnating in them, and con|tinued for &s;everal miles in almo&s;t every direction beyond the town, which is al&s;o inter&s;ected by five or &s;ix rivers, &s;ome of which are navigable thirty or forty miles up the country. As the hou&s;es are large, and the &s;treets wide, it takes up a much greater extent, in proportion to the number of hou&s;es it con|tains, than any city in Europe. Valentyn, who wrote an account of it about the year 1726, &s;ays, that in his time there were, within the walls, 1242 Dutch hou&s;es, and 1200 Chine&s;e, and without the walls 1066 Dutch and 1240 Chine&s;e, be&s;ides 12 arrack hou&s;es, making in all 4760: but this account appeared to us to be greatly exaggerated, e&s;pecially with re|&s;pect to the number of hou&s;es within the walls.</P>
<P>The &s;treets are &s;pacious and hand&s;ome, and the banks of the canals are planted with rows of trees, that make a very plea&s;ing appearance; but the trees concur with the canals to make the &s;ituation unwhole&s;ome. The &s;tagnant canals in the dry &s;ea&s;on exhale an intolerable &s;tench, and the trees impede the cour&s;e of the air, by which in &s;ome degree the putrid effluvia would be di&s;&s;ipated. In the wet &s;ea&s;on the inconvenience is equal, for then the&s;e re&s;ervoirs of corrupted water overflow their banks in the lower part of the town, e&s;pecially in the neighbourhood of the hotel, and fill the lower &s;tories of the hou&s;es, where they leave behind them an inconceivable quantity of &s;lime and filth: yet the&s;e canals are &s;ometimes cleaned; but the cleaning them is &s;o managed as to become as great a nui&s;ance as the foulne&s;s of the water; for the black mud that is taken from the bottom is &s;uffered to lie upon the banks, that is, in the middle of the &s;treet, till it has acquired a &s;ufficient degree of hardne&s;s to be made the lading of a boat, and carried away. As this mud con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of human ordure, which is regularly thrown into the canals every morning, there not being a nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;e in the whole town, it poi&s;ons the air while it is drying to a con&s;iderable extent. Even the running &s;treams become nui&s;ances in their turn, by the na&s;tine&s;s or negligence of the people; for every now and then a dead hog, or a dead hor&s;e, is &s;tranded upon the &s;hallow parts, and it being the bu&s;ine&s;s of no parti|cular
<PB N="204" REF="013324_0493_0F8FFB5A0BF10D78">
per&s;on to remove the nui&s;ance, it is negligently left to time and accident. While we were here, a dead buffalo lay upon the &s;hoal of a river that ran through one of the principal &s;treets above a week, and at la&s;t was carried away by a flood.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are in general well adapted to the climate; they con&s;i&s;t of one very large room or hall on the ground floor, with a door at each end, both which generally &s;tand open: at one end a room is taken off by a partition, where the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e tran&s;acts his bu&s;ine&s;s; and in the middle between each end there is a court, which gives light to the hall, and at the &s;ame time increa&s;es the draught of air. From one corner of the hall the &s;tairs go up to the floor above, where al&s;o the rooms are &s;pacious and airy. In the alcove, which is formed by the court, the family dine; and at other times it is occupied by the female &s;laves, who are not allowed to &s;it down any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>The public buildings are, mo&s;t of them, old, heavy, and ungraceful; but the new church is not inelegant; it is built with a dome, that is &s;een from a great di&s;tance at &s;ea, and though the out&s;ide has rather a heavy appearance, the in&s;ide forms a very fine room: it is furni&s;hed with an organ of a proper &s;ize, being very large, and is mo&s;t magnificently illu|minated by chandeliers.</P>
<P>The town is inclo&s;ed by a &s;tone wall, of a moderate height; but the whole of it is old, and many parts are much out of re|pair. This wall it&s;elf is &s;urrounded by a river, which in &s;ome places is fifty, and in &s;ome a hundred yards wide: the &s;tream is rapid, but the water is &s;hallow. The wall is al&s;o lined within by a canal, which in different parts is of different breadths; &s;o that, in pa&s;&s;ing either out or in through the gates, it is nece&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s two draw-bridges; and there is no acce&s;s for idle people or &s;trangers to walk upon the ramparts, which &s;eem to be but ill provided with guns.</P>
<P>In the north ea&s;t corner of the town &s;tands the ca&s;tle or cita|del, the walls of which are both higher and thicker than tho&s;e of the town, e&s;pecially near the landing-place, where there is depth of water only for boats, which it completely commands, with &s;everal large guns that make a very good appearance.</P>
<P>Within this ca&s;tle are apartments for the Governor General, and all the Council of India, to which they are enjoined to re|pair in ca&s;e of a &s;iege. Here are al&s;o large &s;torehou&s;es, where great quantities of the Company's goods are kept, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are brought from Europe, and where almo&s;t all their writers tran&s;act their bu&s;ine&s;s. In this place al&s;o are laid up a great number of cannon, whether to mount upon the walls or furni&s;h &s;hipping, we could not learn; and the Company is &s;aid to be well &s;upplied with powder, which is di&s;per&s;ed in various magazines, that if &s;ome &s;hould be de&s;troyed by light|ning, which in this place is very frequent, the re&s;t may e&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="013324_0494_0F8FFB5B2E159F68">
Be&s;ides the fortifications of the town, numerous forts are di&s;per&s;ed about the country to the di&s;tance of twenty or thirty miles; the&s;e &s;eem to have been intended merely to keep the natives in awe, and indeed they are fit for nothing el&s;e. For the &s;ame purpo&s;e a kind of hou&s;es, each of which mounts about eight guns, are placed in &s;uch &s;ituations as command the na|vigation of three or four canals, and con&s;equently the roads upon their banks: &s;ome of the&s;e are in the town it&s;elf, and it was from one of the&s;e that all the be&s;t hou&s;es belonging to the Chine&s;e were levelled with the ground, in the Chine&s;e rebellion of 1740, The&s;e defences are &s;cattered over all parts of Java, and the other i&s;lands of which the Dutch have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the&s;e &s;eas. Of one of the&s;e &s;ingular forts, or for|tified hou&s;es, we &s;hould have procured a drawing, if our Gent|lemen had not been confined by &s;ickne&s;s, almo&s;t all the time they were upon the i&s;land.</P>
<P>If the Dutch fortifications here are not formidable in them|&s;elves, they become &s;o by their &s;ituation; for they are among mora&s;&s;es where the roads, which are nothing more than a bank thrown up between a canal and a ditch, may ea&s;ily be de&s;troyed, and con&s;equently the approach of heavy artillery either totally prevented or greatly retarded: for it would be exceedingly difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible to tran&s;port them in boats, as they all mu&s;ter every night under the guns of the ca&s;tle, a &s;ituation from which it would be impo&s;&s;ible for an enemy to take them. Be&s;ides, in this country, delay is death; &s;o that whatever retards an enemy, will de&s;troy him. In le&s;s than a week we were &s;en&s;ible of the unhealthine&s;s of the cli|mate; and in le&s;s than a month half the &s;hip's company were unable to do their duty. We were told, that of a hundred &s;oldiers who arrive here from Europe, it was a rare thing for fifty to &s;urvive the fir&s;t year; that of tho&s;e fifty, half would then be in the ho&s;pital, and not ten of the re&s;t in perfect health: po&s;&s;ibly this account may be exaggerated; but the pale and feeble wretches whom we &s;aw crawling about with a mu&s;quet, which they were &s;carcely able to carry, inclined us to believe that it was true. Every white inhabitant of the town indeed is a &s;oldier; the younger are con&s;tantly mu&s;tered, and tho&s;e who have &s;erved five years are liable to be called out, when their a&s;&s;i&s;tance is thought nece&s;&s;ary; but as neither of them are ever exerci&s;ed, or do any kind of duty, much cannot be expected from them. The Portugue&s;e, indeed, are in ge|neral good mark&s;men, becau&s;e they employ them&s;elves much in &s;hooting wild hogs and deer: neither the Mardykers, nor the Chine&s;e know the u&s;e of fire-arms; but as they are &s;aid to be brave they might do much execution with their own wea|pons, &s;words, lances, and daggers. The Mardykers are In|dians of all nations, who are de&s;cended from free ance&s;tors, or have them&s;elves been made free.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="013324_0495_0F90F1C47252D7D0">
But if it is difficult to attack Batavia by land, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to attack it by &s;ea: for the water is &s;o &s;hallow, that it will &s;carcely admit a long boat to come within cannon &s;hot of the walls, except in a narrow channel, called the river, that is walled on both &s;ides by &s;trong piers, and runs about half a mile into the harbour. At the other end, it terminates under the fire of the &s;tronge&s;t part of the ca&s;tle; and here its communication with the canals that inter&s;ect the town is out off by a large wooden boom, which is &s;hut every night at &s;ix o'clock, and upon no pretence opened till the next morning. The harbour of Batavia is accounted the fine&s;t in India, and to all appearance with good rea&s;on; it is large enough to con|tain any number of &s;hips, and the ground is &s;o good that one anchor will hold till the cable decays: it never admits any &s;ea that is trouble&s;ome, and its only inconvenience is the &s;hoal water between the road and the river. When the &s;ea breeze blows fre&s;h, it makes a cockling &s;ea that is dangerous to boats: our long boat once &s;truck two or three times, as &s;he was at|tempting to come out, and regained the river's mouth with &s;ome difficulty. A Dutch boat, laden with &s;ails and rigging for one of the Indiamen, was entirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Round the harbour, on the out&s;ide lie many i&s;lands, which the Dutch have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and apply to different u&s;es. To one of them, called Edam, they tran&s;port all Europeans who have been guilty of crimes that are not worthy of death: &s;ome are &s;entenced to remain there ninety-nine years, &s;ome forty, &s;ame twenty, &s;ome le&s;s, down to five, in proportion to their offence; and during their bani&s;hment, they are employ|ed as &s;laves in making ropes, and other drudgery. In another i&s;land, called Purmerent, they have an ho&s;pital, where people are &s;aid to recover much fa&s;ter than at Batavia. In a third, called Kuyper, they have warehou&s;es belonging to the Com|pany, chiefly for rice, and other merchandize of &s;mall value; and here the foreign &s;hips, that are to be laid down at Ouru&s;t, another of the&s;e i&s;lands, which with Kuyper has been men|tioned before, di&s;charge their cargoes at wharfs which are ve|ry convenient for the purpo&s;e. Here the guns, &s;ails, and other &s;tores of the Falmouth, a man of war, which was condemned at this place, when &s;he was returning from Manilla, were de|po&s;ited, and the &s;hip her&s;elf remained into the harbour with the only warrant officers on board for many years. Remit|tances were regularly made them from home; but no notice was ever taken of the many memorials they &s;ent, de&s;iring to be recalled. Happily for them, the Dutch thought fit, about &s;ix months before our arrival, to &s;ell the ve&s;&s;el and all her &s;tores, by public auction, and &s;end the officers home in their own &s;hips. At Ouru&s;t, they repair all their own &s;hipping, and keep a large quantity of naval &s;tores.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="013324_0496_0F90F1CA279E0378">
The country round Batavia is for &s;ome miles a continued range of country hou&s;es and gardens. Many of the gardens are very large, and, by &s;ome &s;trange fatality, all are planted with trees almo&s;t as thick as they can &s;tand; &s;o that the coun|try derives no advantage from its being cleared of the wood that originally covered it, except the fruit of that which has been planted in its room. The&s;e impenetrable fore&s;ts &s;tand in a dead &s;lat, which extends &s;ome miles beyond them, and is inter&s;ected in many directions by rivers, and more &s;till by canals, which are navigable for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. Nor is this the wor&s;t, for the fence of every field and garden is a ditch; and inter&s;per&s;ed among the cultivated ground there are many fil|thy fens, bogs and mora&s;&s;es, as well fre&s;h as &s;alt.</P>
<P>It is not &s;trange that the inhabitants of &s;uch a country &s;hould be familiar with di&s;ea&s;e and death: preventive medi|cines are taken almo&s;t as regularly as food; and every body expects the returns of &s;ickne&s;s, as we do the &s;ea&s;ons of the year. We did not &s;ee a &s;ingle face in Batavia that indicated perfect health, for there is not the lea&s;t tint of colour in the cheeks either of men or women: the women indeed are mo&s;t delicately fair; but with the appearance of di&s;ea&s;e there never can be perfect beauty. People talk of death with as much in|difference as they do in a camp; and when an acquaintance is &s;aid to be dead, the common reply is, <Q>Well, he owed me nothing; or, I mu&s;t yet my money of his executors.</Q></P>
<P>To this de&s;cription of the environs of Batavia there are but two exceptions. The Governor's country hou&s;e is &s;ituated upon a ri&s;ing ground; but its a&s;cent is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it is known to be above the common level only by the canals being left behind, and the appearance of a few bad hedges: his Excellency, however, who is a native of this place, has, with &s;ome trouble and expence, contrived to inclo&s;e his own garden with a ditch; &s;uch is the influence of habit both upon the ta&s;te and the under&s;tanding. A famous market al&s;o, cal|led Pa&s;&s;ar Tanabank, is held upon an eminence that ri&s;es per|pendicularly about thirty feet above the plain; and except the&s;e &s;ituations, the ground, for an extent of between thirty and forty miles round Batavia, is exactly parallel to the hori|zon. At the di&s;tance of about forty miles inland there are hills of a con&s;iderable height, where, as we were informed, the air is healthy, and comparatively cool. Here the vegetables of Europe flouri&s;h in great perfection, particularly &s;trawberries, which can but ill bear heat; and the inhabitants are vigo|rous and ruddy. Upon the&s;e hills &s;ome of the principal people have country hou&s;es, which they vi&s;it once a year; and one was begun for the Governor upon the plan of Blenheim, the famous &s;eat of the Duke of Marlborough, in Oxford&s;hire, but it has never been fini&s;hed. To the&s;e hills al&s;o people are &s;ent
<PB N="208" REF="013324_0497_0F90F1CB95A653F0">
by the phy&s;icians, for the recovery of their health, and the effects of the air are &s;aid to be almo&s;t miraculous: the patient grows well in a &s;hort time, but con&s;tantly relap&s;es &s;oon after his return to Batavia.</P>
<P>But the &s;ame &s;ituation and circum&s;tances which render Ba|tavia and the country round it unwhole&s;ome, render it the be&s;t gardener's ground in the world. The &s;oil is fruitful beyond imagination, and the conveniencies and luxuries of life that it produces are almo&s;t without number.</P>
<P>Rice, which is well known to be the corn of the&s;e coun|tries, and to &s;erve the inhabitants in&s;tead of bread, grows in great plenty: and I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that in the hilly parts of Java, and in many of the ea&s;tern i&s;lands, a &s;pecies of this grain is planted, which in the we&s;tern parts of India is intire|ly unknown. It is called by the natives PADDY GUNUNG, or Mountain rice; this, contrary to the other &s;ort which mu&s;t be under water three parts in four of the time of its growth, is planted upon the &s;ides of hills, where no water but rain can come: it is however planted at the beginning of the rainy &s;ea|&s;on, and reaped in the beginning of &s;he dry. How far this kind of rice might be u&s;eful in our We&s;t Indian i&s;lands, where no bread corn is grown, it may perhaps be worth while to en|quire.</P>
<P>Indian corn, or maize, is al&s;o produced here, which the inhabitants gather when young, and toa&s;t in the ear. Here is al&s;o a great variety of kidney beans, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntiles, which they call CADJANG, and which make a con&s;iderable part of the food of the common people; be&s;ides millet, yams both wet and dry, &s;weet potatoes, and European potatoes, which are very good, but not cultivated in great plenty. In the gardens, there are cabbages, lettuces, cucumbers, rhadi&s;hes, the white rhadi&s;hes of China, which boil almo&s;t as well as a turnep; carrots, par&s;ley, celery, pigeon peas, the egg plant, which broiled, and eaten with pepper and &s;alt, is very deli|cious; a kind of greens re&s;embling &s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">age; onions, very &s;mall, but excellent; and a&s;paragus: be&s;ides &s;ome European plants of a &s;trong &s;mell, particularly &s;age, hy&s;op, and rue. Sugar is al&s;o produced here in immen&s;e quantities: very great crops of the fine&s;t and large&s;t canes that can be imagined are produced with very little care, and yield a much larger pro|portion of &s;ugar than the canes of the We&s;t Indies. White &s;ugar is &s;old here at two pence half-penny a pound; and the mola&s;&s;es makes the arrack, of which, as of rum, it is the chief ingredient; a &s;mall quantity of rice, and &s;ome cocoa-nut wine being added, chiefly, I &s;uppo&s;e, to give it flavour. A &s;mall quantity of indigo is al&s;o produced here, not as an ar|ticle of trade, but merely for home con&s;umption.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t abundant article of vegetable luxury here, is
<PB N="209" REF="013324_0498_0F90F1D119804648">
the fruit; of which there is no le&s;s than &s;ix and thirty diffe|rent kinds, and I &s;hall give a very brief account of each.</P>
<P N="1">1. The pine apple; <HI>Bromelia Ananas.</HI> This fruit, which is here called <HI>Nanas,</HI> grows very large, and in &s;uch plenty that they may &s;ometimes be bought at the fir&s;t hand for a far|thing a piece; and at the common fruit &s;hops we got three of them for two pence half-penny. They are very juicy and well flavoured; but we all agreed we had eaten as good from a hot-hou&s;e in England: they are however &s;o luxuriant in their growth that mo&s;t of them have two or three crowns, and a great number of &s;uckers from the bottom of the fruit; of the&s;e Mr. Banks once counted nine, and they are &s;o for|ward that very often while they &s;till adhered to the parent plant they &s;hot out their fruit, which, by the time the large one became ripe, were of no incon&s;iderable &s;ize. We &s;eve|ral times &s;aw three upon one apple, and were told that a plant once produced a clu&s;ter of nine, be&s;ides the principal: this indeed was con&s;idered as &s;o great a curio&s;ity, that it was pre|&s;erved in &s;ugar, and &s;ent to the Prince of Orange.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sweet Oranges. The&s;e are very good, but while we were here &s;old for &s;ix pence a piece.</P>
<P N="3">3. Pumplemoe&s;es, which in the We&s;t Indies are called Shaddocks. The&s;e were well flavoured, but not juicy! their want of juice however was an accidental effect of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P N="4">4. Lemons. The&s;e were very &s;carce; but the want of them was amply compen&s;ated by the plenty of limes.</P>
<P N="5">5. Limes. The&s;e were excellent, and to be bought at about twelve pence a hundred. We &s;aw only two or three Seville oranges, which were almo&s;t all rind; and there are many &s;orts both of oranges and lemons, which I &s;hall not particularly mention, becau&s;e they are neither e&s;teemed by Europeans, nor the natives them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="6">6. Mangos. This fruit during our &s;tay was &s;o infe&s;ted with maggots, which bred in the in&s;ide of them, that &s;carcely one in three was eatable; and the be&s;t of them were much in|ferior to tho&s;e of Brazil; they are generally compared by Eu|ropeans to a melting peach, which, indeed, they re&s;emble in &s;oftne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s, but certainly fall much &s;hort in flavour. The climate here, we were told, is too hot and damp for them; but there are as many &s;orts of them as there are of apples in England, and &s;ome are much &s;uperior to others. One &s;ort which is called <HI>Mangha Cowani,</HI> has &s;o &s;trong a &s;mell that a European can &s;carcely bear one in the room; the&s;e, however, the natives are fond of. The three &s;orts which are generally preferred, are the <HI>Mangha Doodool,</HI> the <HI>Mangha San|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ock,</HI> and the <HI>Mangha Gure.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Bananes. Of the&s;e al&s;o there are innumerable &s;orts, but three are only good; the <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Mas,</HI> the <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Radja,</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="013324_0499_0F90F1D2A4B93EC0">
and the <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Ambou:</HI> all the&s;e have a plea&s;ant vinous ta&s;te, and the re&s;t are u&s;eful in different ways; &s;ome are fried in batter, and others are boiled and eaten as bread. There is one which de&s;erves the particular notice of the botani&s;t, be|cau&s;e contrary to the nature of its tribe, it is full of &s;eeds, and is therefore called <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Batu,</HI> or <HI>Pi&s;&s;ang Bidjie;</HI> it has how|ever no excellence to recommend it to the ta&s;te, but the Ma|lays u&s;e it as a remedy for the flux.</P>
<P N="8">8. Grapes. The&s;e are not in great perfection, but they are very dear; for we could not buy a moderate bunch for le&s;s than a &s;hilling or eighteen pence.</P>
<P N="9">9. Tamarinds. The&s;e are in great plenty, and very cheap: The people however do not put them up in the manner prac|ti&s;ed by the We&s;t-Indians, but cure them with &s;alt, by which means they become a black ma&s;s, &s;o di&s;agreeable to the &s;ight and ta&s;te, that few Europeans chu&s;e to meddle with them.</P>
<P N="10">10. Water melons. The&s;e are in great plenty, and very good.</P>
<P N="11">11. Pumpkins. The&s;e are beyond compari&s;on the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful fruit that can be carried to &s;ea; for they will keep without any care &s;everal months, and with &s;ugar and lemon juice, make a pye that can &s;carcely be di&s;tingui&s;hed from one made of the be&s;t apples; and with pepper and &s;alt, they are a &s;ub&s;titute for turneps not to be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="12">12. Papaws. This fruit when it is ripe is full of &s;eeds, and almo&s;t without flavour; but if when it is green it is pared, and the core taken out, it is better than the be&s;t turnep.</P>
<P N="13">13. Guava. This fruit is much commended by the inha|bitants of our i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies, who probably have a better &s;ort than we met with here, where the &s;mell of them was &s;o di&s;agreeably &s;trong that it made &s;ome of us &s;ick; tho&s;e who ta&s;ted them, &s;aid, that the flavour was equally rank.</P>
<P N="14">14. Sweet &s;op. The <HI>Annona &s;quammo&s;a</HI> of Linaeus. This is al&s;o a We&s;t Indian fruit; it con&s;i&s;ts only of a ma&s;s of large kernels, from which a &s;mall proportion of pulp may be &s;ucked, which is very &s;weet, but has little flavour.</P>
<P N="15">15. Cu&s;tard apple. The <HI>Annona reticulata</HI> of Linaeus. The quality of this fruit is well expre&s;&s;ed by its Engli&s;h name, which it acquired in the We&s;t Indies; for it is as like a cu&s;|tard, and a good one too, as can be imagined.</P>
<P N="16">16. The ca&s;hew apple. This is &s;eldom eaten on account of its a&s;tringency. The nut that grows upon the top of it is well known in Europe.</P>
<P N="17">17. The cocoa-nut. This is al&s;o well known in Europe: there are &s;everal &s;orts, but the be&s;t of tho&s;e we found here is called <HI>Calappi Edjou,</HI> and is ea&s;ily known by the redne&s;s of the fle&s;h between the &s;kin and the &s;hell.</P>
<P N="18">18. Mango&s;tan. The <HI>Garci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ia Mango&s;tana</HI> of Linaeus. This
<PB N="211" REF="013324_0500_0F90F1D2C8B3DC08">
fruit, which is peculiar to the Ea&s;t-Indies, is about the &s;ize of the crab apple, and of a deep red wine-colour: on the top of it is the figure of five or &s;ix &s;mall triangles joined in a circle, and at the bottom &s;everal hollow green leaves, which are re|mains of the blo&s;&s;om. When they are to be eaten, the &s;kin, or rather fle&s;h, mu&s;t be taken off, under which are found &s;ix or &s;even white kernels, placed in a circular order, and the pulp with which the&s;e are inveloped, is the fruit, than which nothing can be more delicious: it is a happy mixture of the tart and the &s;weet, which is no le&s;s whole&s;ome than plea&s;ant; and with the &s;weet orange, this fruit is allowed in any quanti|ty to tho&s;e who are afflicted with fevers, either of the putrid or inflammatory kind.</P>
<P N="19">19. The jamboo. The <HI>Eugenia Mallaccen&s;is</HI> of Linnaeus. This fruit is of a deep red colour, and an oval &s;hape; the large&s;t, which are always the be&s;t, are not bigger than a &s;mall apple; they are plea&s;ant and cooling, though they have not much flavour.</P>
<P N="20">20. The jambu-eyer. A &s;pecies of the <HI>Eugenia</HI> of Linnaeus. Of this fruit there are two &s;orts of a &s;imilar &s;hape, re&s;embling a bell, but differing in colour; one being red, the other white. They &s;omewhat exceed a large cherry in &s;ize, and in ta&s;te have neither flavour nor even &s;weetne&s;s, containing no|thing but a watry juice, &s;lightly acidulated; yet their cool|ne&s;s recommends them in this hot country.</P>
<P N="21">21. Jambu-eyer mauwar. The <HI>Eugenia jambos</HI> of Linnaeus. This is more grateful to the &s;mell than the ta&s;te; in ta&s;te it re|&s;embles the con&s;erve of ro&s;es, and in &s;mell the fre&s;h &s;cent of tho&s;e flowers.</P>
<P N="22">22. The pomgranate. This is the &s;ame fruit that is known by the &s;ame name all over Europe.</P>
<P N="23">23. Durion. A fruit that in &s;hape re&s;embles a &s;mall melon, but the &s;kin is covered with &s;harp conical &s;pines, whence its name; for <HI>dure,</HI> in the Malay language, &s;ignifies prickle. When it is ripe, it divides longitudinally into &s;even or eight compartments, each of which contains &s;ix or &s;even nuts, not quite &s;o large as che&s;nuts, which are covered with a &s;ub|&s;tance that in colour and con&s;i&s;tence very much re&s;embles thick cream: this is the part that is eaten, and the natives are fond of it to exce&s;s. To Europeans it is generally di&s;agreeable at fir&s;t; for in ta&s;te, it &s;omewhat re&s;embles a mixture of cream, &s;ugar, and onions; and in the &s;mell the onions predominate.</P>
<P N="24">24. Nanca. This fruit, which in &s;ome parts of India is called Jack, has, like the Durion, a &s;mell very di&s;agreeable to &s;trangers, and &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of mellow apples mixed with garlic: the flavour is not more adapted to the ge|neral ta&s;te. In &s;ome countries that are favourable to it, it is &s;aid to grow to an immen&s;e &s;ize. Rumphius relates, that it
<PB N="212" REF="013324_0501_0F90F1D39F160DB8">
is &s;ometimes &s;o large that a man cannot ea&s;ily lift it; and we were told by a Malay, that at Madura it is &s;ometimes &s;o large as not to be carried but by the united efforts of two men. At Batavia, however, they never exceed the &s;ize of a large melon, which in &s;hape they very much re&s;emble: they are covered with angular prickles, like the &s;hootings of &s;ome chry&s;|tals, which however are not hard enough to wound tho&s;e who handle them.</P>
<P N="25">25. Champada. This differs from the Nanca in little ex|cept &s;ize, it not being &s;o big.</P>
<P N="26">26. Rambutan. This is a fruit little known to Europeans; in appearance it very much re&s;embles a che&s;nut with the hu&s;k on, and like that, is covered with &s;mall points, which are &s;oft and of a deep red colour: under this &s;kin is the fruit, and within the fruit a &s;tone; the eatable part therefore is &s;mall in quantity, but its acid is perhaps more agreeable than any other in the whole vegetable kingdom.</P>
<P N="27">27. Jambolan. This in &s;ize and appearance is not unlike a dama&s;cene; but in ta&s;te is &s;till more a&s;tringent, and therefore le&s;s agreeable.</P>
<P N="28">28. The Boa Bidarra; or <HI>Rhamnus Juj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ba</HI> of Linnaeus. This is a round yellow fruit, about the &s;ize of a goo&s;eberry; its flavour is like that of an apple, but it has the a&s;tringency of a crab.</P>
<P N="29">29. Nam nam. The <HI>Cynometra Cauliflora</HI> of Linnaeus. This fruit in &s;hape &s;omewhat re&s;embles a kidney; it is about three inches long, and the out&s;ide is very rough: it is &s;eldom eaten raw, but fried with batter it makes a good fritter.</P>
<P N="30, 31">30, 31. The Catappa, or <HI>Terminalia Catappa,</HI> and the Canare, the <HI>Canarium commune</HI> of Linaeus; are both nuts, with kernels &s;omewhat re&s;embling an almond; but the difficulty of breaking the &s;hell is &s;o great, that they are no where publicly &s;old. Tho&s;e which we ta&s;ted were gathered for curio&s;ity by Mr. Banks, from the tree upon which they grew.</P>
<P N="32">32. The Madja; or <HI>Limonia</HI> of Linnaeus; contains, under a hard brittle &s;hell, a lightly acid pulp, which cannot be eaten without &s;ugar; and with it, is not generally thought plea&s;ant.</P>
<P N="33">33. Suntul. The <HI>Trichilia</HI> of Linnaeus. This is the wor&s;t of all the fruits that I &s;hall particularly mention: in &s;ize and &s;hape it re&s;embles the Madja; and within a thick &s;kin con|tains kernels like tho&s;e of the Mango&s;tan, the ta&s;te of which is both acid and a&s;tringent, and &s;o di&s;agreeable that we were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee it expo&s;ed upon the fruit-&s;talls.</P>
<P N="34, 35, 36">34, 35, 36. The Blimbing, or <HI>Averrhoa Belimbi;</HI> the Blimbing Be&s;&s;e, or <HI>Averrhoa Carambola;</HI> and the Cherrema, or <HI>Averhoa acida</HI> of Linnaeus, are three &s;pecies of one genus; and though they differ in &s;hape, are nearly of the &s;ame ta&s;te. The Blimbing Be&s;&s;e is the &s;weete&s;t: the other two are &s;o au&s;|terely

acid, that they cannot be u&s;ed without dre&s;&s;ing; they make however excellent pickles and &s;our &s;auce.</P>
<P N="37">37. The Salack; or <HI>Calamus Rotang Zalacca</HI> of Linnaeus. This is the fruit of a prickly bu&s;h; it is about as big as a wal|nut, and covered with &s;cales, like tho&s;e of a lizard: below the &s;cales are two or three yellow kernels, in flavour &s;omewhat re&s;embling a &s;trawberry.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, the i&s;land of Java, and particularly the coun|try round Batavia, produces many kinds of fruit which were not in &s;ea&s;on during our &s;tay; we were al&s;o told that apples, &s;trawberries, and many other fruits from Europe, had been planted up in the mountains, and flouri&s;hed there in great lu|xuriance. We &s;aw &s;everal fruits pre&s;erved in &s;ugar, that we did not &s;ee recent from the tree, one of which is called <HI>Kim|kit,</HI> and another <HI>Boa A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ap:</HI> and here are &s;everal others which are eaten only by the natives, particularly the <HI>Kellor,</HI> the <HI>Guilin|dina,</HI> the <HI>Moringa,</HI> and the <HI>Soccum.</HI> The Soccum is of the &s;ame kind with the bread-fruit in the South Sea i&s;lands, but &s;o much inferior, that if it had not been for the &s;imilitude in the outward appearance both of the fruit and the tree, we &s;hould not have referred it to that cla&s;s. The&s;e and &s;ome others do not merit to be particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>The quantity of fruit that is con&s;umed at Batavia is incre|dible; but that which is publicly expo&s;ed to &s;ale is generally over-ripe. A &s;tranger however may get good fruit in a &s;treet called Pa&s;&s;ar Pi&s;&s;ang, which lies north from the great church, and very near it. This &s;treet is inhabited by none but Chi|ne&s;e fruit-&s;ellers, who are &s;upplied from the gardens of gentle|men in the neighbourhood of the town, with &s;uch as is fre&s;h, and excellent in its kind, for which however they mu&s;t be paid more than four times the market price.</P>
<P>The town in general is &s;upplied from a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, where great quantities of land are cultivated merely for the production of fruit. The country people, to whom the&s;e lands belong, meet the people of the town at two great mar|kets; one on Monday, called Pa&s;&s;ar Sineen; and the other on Saturday, called Pa&s;&s;ar Tanabank. The&s;e fairs are held at places con&s;iderably di&s;tant from each other, for the convenience of different di&s;tricts; neither of them however are more than five miles di&s;tant from Batavia. At the&s;e fairs, the be&s;t fruit may be bought at the cheape&s;t rate; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of them to a European is very entertaining. The quantity of fruit is a&s;toni&s;hing; forty or fifty car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> loads of the fine&s;t pine apples, packed as carele&s;sly as turneps in England, are common, and other fruit in the &s;ame profu&s;ion. The days however on which the&s;e markets are held are ill contrived; the time be|tween Saturday and Monday is too &s;hort, and that between Monday and Saturday too long: great part of what is bought
<PB N="214" REF="013324_0503_0F90F1D5CA64FAF0">
on Monday is always much the wor&s;e for keeping before a new &s;tock can be bought, either by the retailer or con&s;umer; &s;o that for &s;everal days in every week there is no good fruit in the hands of any people but the Chine&s;e in Pa&s;&s;ar Pi&s;&s;ang.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this part of India practi&s;e a luxury which &s;eems to be but little attended to in other countries; they are continually burning aromatic woods and re&s;ins, and &s;catter odours round them in a profu&s;ion of flowers, po&s;&s;ibly as an antidote to the noi&s;ome effluvia of their ditches and canals. Of &s;weet &s;melling flowers they have a great variety, altogether unknown in Europe, the chief of which I &s;hall briefly de&s;cribe.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Champaka</HI> or <HI>Michelia Champacca.</HI> This grows upon a tree as large as an apple tree, and con&s;i&s;ts of fifteen long narrow petala, which give it the appearance of being double, though in reality it is not &s;o: its colour is yellow, and much deeper than that of a jonquil, to which it has &s;ome re&s;em|blance in &s;mell.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Cananga</HI> or <HI>Uvaria Cananga,</HI> is a green flower, not at all re&s;embling the blo&s;&s;om of any tree or plant in Europe: It has indeed more the appearance of a bunch of leaves than a flower; its &s;cent is agreeable, but altogether peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Mulatti,</HI> or <HI>Nyctanthes Sambac.</HI> This is well known in Engli&s;h hot-hou&s;es by the name of Arabian je&s;&s;amine: it grows here in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion, and its fragrance, like that of all other Indian flowers, though exqui&s;itely plea&s;ing, has not that over-powering &s;trength which di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;ome of the &s;ame &s;orts in Europe.</P>
<P N="4, 5">4, 5. The <HI>Combang Caracna&s;&s;i,</HI> and <HI>Combang Tonquin, Per|cularia Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bro.</HI> The&s;e are &s;mall flowers, of the dog's-bane kind, very much re&s;embling each other in &s;hape and &s;mell, highly fragrant, but very different from every product of an Engli&s;h garden.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Bonga Tanjong,</HI> or <HI>Mimou&s;ops El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngi</HI> of Linnaeus. This flower is &s;haped like a &s;tar of &s;even or eight rays, and is about half an inch in diameter; it is of a yellowi&s;h colour, and has an agreeable &s;mell.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is the <HI>Sundal Malam,</HI> or <HI>Polianthes Tu|bero&s;a.</HI> This flower, being the &s;ame with our own tubero&s;e, can have no place among tho&s;e that are unknown in Europe, but I mention it for its Malay name, which &s;ignifies <Q>In|triguer of the Night,</Q> and is not inelegantly conceived. The heat of this climate is &s;o great, that few flowers exhale their &s;weets in the day; and this in particular, from its total want of &s;cent at that time, and the mode&s;ty of its colour, which is white, &s;eems negligent of attracting admirers, but as &s;oon as night comes on, it diffu&s;es its fragrance, and at once com|pels the attention, and excites the complacency of all who ap|proach it.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="013324_0504_0F90F1D6857DA7A8">
The&s;e are all &s;old about the &s;treets every evening at &s;un|&s;et, either &s;trung upon a thread, in wreaths of about two feet long, or made up into no&s;egays of different forms, either of which may be purcha&s;ed for about a halfpenny. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are in private gardens, many other &s;weet flowers, which are not produced in a &s;ufficient quantity to be brought to mar|ket.

<P>Before I clo&s;e my account of the vegetable productions of this part of India, I mu&s;t take &s;ome notice of the &s;pices. Ja|va originally produced none but pepper. This is now &s;ent from hence into Europe to a great value, but the quantity con|&s;umed here is very &s;mall: the inhabitants u&s;e <HI>Cap&s;icum,</HI> or, as it is called in Europe, Cayan pepper, almo&s;t univer&s;ally in its &s;tead. Cloves and nutmegs, having been monopolized by the Dutch, are become too dear to be plentifully u&s;ed by the other inhabitants of this country, who are very fond of them. Cloves, although they are &s;aid originally to have been the produce of Machian, or Bachian, a &s;mall i&s;land far to the ea&s;tward, and only fifteen miles to the northward of the line, and to have been from thence di&s;&s;eminated by the Dutch, at their fir&s;t coming into the&s;e parts, over all the ea&s;tern i&s;lands, are now confined to Amboina, and the &s;mall i&s;les that lie in its neighbourhood; the Dutch having, by different treaties of peace between them and the conquered kings of all the other i&s;lands, &s;tipulated, that they &s;hould have only a certain num|ber of trees in their dominions, and in future quarrels, as a puni&s;hment for di&s;obedience and rebellion le&s;&s;ened the quan|tity, till at la&s;t they left them no claim to any. Nutmegs have in a manner been extirpated in all the i&s;lands except their fir&s;t native &s;oil, Banda, which ea&s;ily &s;upplies every nation upon earth, and would as ea&s;ily &s;upply every nation upon earth, and would as ea&s;ily &s;upply every nation in another globe of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions, if there was any &s;uch to which the indu&s;trious Hollander could tran&s;port the commodity; it is, however, certain, that there are a few trees of this &s;pice upon the coa&s;t of New Guinea. There may perhaps be both cloves and nutmegs upon the other i&s;lands to the ea&s;tward; for tho&s;e, neither the Dutch, nor any other European, &s;eem to think it worth while to examine.</P>
<P>The principal tame quadrupeds of this county are hor&s;es,
<PB N="216" REF="013324_0505_0F90F1D7431100F0">
cattle, buffalos, &s;heep, goats, and hogs. The hor&s;es are &s;mall, never exceeding in &s;ize what we call a &s;tout galloway, but they are nimble and &s;pirited, and are reported to have been found here when the Europeans fir&s;t came round the Cape of Good Hope. The horned cattle are &s;aid to be the &s;ame &s;pe|cies as tho&s;e in Europe, but they differ &s;o much in appearance, that we were inclined to doubt it: they have indeed the <HI>pa|learia</HI> or <HI>dewlap,</HI> which naturali&s;ts make the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the European &s;pecies, but they certainly are found wild, not only in Java but &s;everal of the ea&s;tern i&s;lands. The fle&s;h of tho&s;e that we eat at Batavia, had a finer grain than European beef, but it was le&s;s juicy, and mi&s;erably lean. Buffaloes are plenty, but the Dutch never eat them, nor will they drink their milk, being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a notion that both are unwhole&s;ome, and tend to produce fevers; though the natives and Chine&s;e eat both, without any injury to their health. The &s;heep are of the kind which have long ears that hang down, and hair in&s;tead of wool: the fle&s;h of the&s;e is hard and tough, and in every re&s;pect the wor&s;t mutton we ever &s;aw: we found here, however, a few Cape &s;heep, which are excellent, but &s;o dear that we gave five and forty &s;hilling a piece for four of them, the heavie&s;t of which weighed only five and forty pounds. The goats are not better than the &s;heep, but the hogs, e&s;pecially the Chine&s;e breed, are incomparable, and &s;o far, that the purcha&s;er agrees for the lean &s;eperately. The butcher, who is always a Chine&s;e, without the lea&s;t &s;cruple cuts off as much of the fa as he is de&s;ired, and after|wards &s;ells it to his countrymen, who melt it down, and eat it in&s;tead of butter with their rice: but notwith&s;tanding the excellence of this pork, the Dutch are &s;o &s;trongly prejudiced in favour of every thing that comes from their native country, that they eat only of the Dutch breed, which are here &s;old as much dearer than the Chine&s;e, as the Chine&s;e are &s;old dearer than the Dutch in Europe.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e animals, which are tame, they have dogs and cats, and there are among the di&s;tant mountains &s;ome wild hor&s;es and cattle: buffalos are not found wild in any part of Java, though they abound in Macca&s;&s;ar, and &s;everal other ea&s;tern i&s;land. The neighbourhood of Batavia, however, is plentifully &s;upplied with two kinds of deer, and wild hogs, which are &s;old at a rea&s;onable price by the Portugue&s;e, who &s;hoot them, and are very good food.</P>
<P>Among the mountains, and in the de&s;art parts of the i&s;land, there are tygers, it is &s;aid, in great abundance, and &s;ome rhinocero&s;es; in the&s;e parts al&s;o there are monkies, and there are a few of them even in the neighbourhood of Batavia.</P>
<P>Of fi&s;h, here is an amazing plenty; many &s;orts are excel|lent, and all are very cheap, except the few that are &s;carce.

It happens here, as in other places, that vanity gets the better even of appetite: the cheap fi&s;h, mo&s;t of which is of the be&s;t kind, is the food only of &s;laves, and that which is dear, only becau&s;e it is &s;carce, and very much inferior in every re&s;pect, is placed upon the tables of the rich. A &s;en&s;ible hou&s;e-keeper once &s;poke to us freely upon the &s;ubject. I know, &s;aid he, as well as you, that I could purcha&s;e a better di&s;h of fi&s;h for a &s;hilling, than what now co&s;ts me ten; but if I &s;hould make &s;o good u&s;e of my money, I &s;hould here be as much de&s;pi&s;ed, as you would be in Europe, if you were to cover your table with offals, fit only for beggars or dogs.</P>
<P>Turtle is al&s;o found here, but it is neither &s;o &s;weet, nor &s;o fat as the We&s;t Indian turtle, even in London; &s;uch as it is, however, we &s;hould con&s;ider it as a dainty; but the Dutch, among other &s;ingularities, do not eat it. We &s;aw &s;ome li|zards, or Inguanas, here of a very large &s;ize; we were told that &s;ome were as thick as man's thigh, and Mr. Banks &s;hot one that was five feet long: the fle&s;h of this animal proved to be very good food.</P>
<P>Poultry is very good here, and in great plenty: fowls of a very large &s;ize, ducks, and gee&s;e are very cheap; pigeons are dear, and the price of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rkies extravagant. We &s;ometimes found the fle&s;h of the&s;e animals lean and dry, but this was merely the effect of their being ill fed, for tho&s;e that we fed our&s;elves were as good as any of the &s;ame kind that we had ta&s;ted in Europe, and we &s;ometimes thought them even better.</P>
<P>Wild fowl in general is &s;carce. We once &s;aw a wild duck in the fields, but never any that were to be &s;old. We fre|quently &s;aw &s;nipes of two kinds, one of them exactly the &s;ame as that in Europe, and a kind of thru&s;h was always to be had in great plenty of the Portugue&s;e, who, for I know not what rea&s;on, &s;eem to have monopolized the wild fowl and game. Of &s;nipes it is remarkable that they are found in more parts of the world than any other bird, being common almo&s;t all over Europe, A&s;ia, Africa, and America.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to drink, Nature has not been quite &s;o liberal to the inhabitants of Java as to &s;ome whom &s;he has placed in the le&s;s fruitful regions of the north. The native Javane&s;e, and mo&s;t of the other Indians who inhabit this i&s;land, are in|deed Mahometans, and therefore have no rea&s;on to regret the want of wine; but, as if the prohibition of their law re&s;pect|ed only the manner of becoming drunk, and not drunkenne&s;s it&s;elf, they chew opium, to the total &s;ubver&s;ion not only of their under&s;tanding but their health.</P>
<P>The arrack that is made here, is too well known to need a de&s;cription: be&s;ides which, the palm yields a wine of the &s;ame kind with that which has already been de&s;cribed in the account of the i&s;land of Savu; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s is procured from the &s;ame

The fir&s;t, in which it is called <HI>Tuac mani&s;e,</HI> differs little from that in which it comes from the tree; yet even this has received &s;ome preparation altogether unknown to us, in con&s;equence of which it will keep eight and forty hours, though otherwi&s;e it would &s;poil in twelve: in this &s;tate it has an agreeable &s;weet|ne&s;s and will not intoxicate. In the other two &s;tates it has un|dergone a fermentation, and received an infu&s;ion of certain herbs and roots, by which it loo&s;es its &s;weetne&s;s, and acquires a ta&s;te very au&s;tere and di&s;agreeable. In one of the&s;e &s;tates it is called <HI>Tuac cras,</HI> and in the other <HI>Tuac cunning,</HI> but the &s;pe|cific difference I do not know; in both, however, it intoxi|cates very powerfully.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Some Account of the Inhabitants of Batavia, and the adjacent Country, their Manners, Cu&s;toms, and Manner of Life.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Batavia, although, as I have already ob|&s;erved, it is the capital of the Dutch dominions in In|dia, is &s;o far from being peopled with Dutchmen, that not one fifth part, even of the European inhabitants of the town, and its environs, are natives of Holland, or of Dutch extrac|tion: the greater part are Portugue&s;e, and be&s;ides Europeans, there are Indians of various nations, and Chine&s;e, be&s;ides a great number of negro &s;laves. In the troops, there are na|tives of almo&s;t every country in Europe, but the Germans are more than all the re&s;t put together; there are &s;ome Engli&s;h and French, but the Dutch, though other Europeans are permitted to get money here, keep all the power in their own hands, and con&s;equently po&s;&s;e&s;s all public employments. No man, of whatever nation, can come hither to &s;ettle, in any other character than that of a &s;oldier in the Company's &s;ervice, in which, before they are accepted, they mu&s;t covenant to re|main five years. As &s;oon however, as this form has been complied with, they are allowed, upon application to the council, to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from their corps, and enter im|mediately into any branch of trade, which their money or cre|dit will enable them to carry on; and by this means it is that all the white inhabitants of the place are &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Women, however, of all nations, are permitted to &s;ettle here, without coming under any re&s;trictions; yet we were told that there were not, when when we were at Batavia, twenty
<PB N="219" REF="013324_0508_0F90F1D9928C1BA0">
women in the place that were born in Europe but that the white women, who were by no means &s;carce, were de&s;cendants from European parents of the third and fourth generation, the gleanings of many families who had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively come hither, and in the male line become extinct; for it is certain that, whatever be the cau&s;e, this climate is not &s;o fatal to the ladies as to the other &s;ex.</P>
<P>The&s;e women imitate the Indians in every particular; their dre&s;s is made of the &s;ame materials, their hair is worn in the &s;ame manner, and they are equally en&s;laved by the habit of chewing betele.</P>
<P>The merchants carry on their bu&s;ine&s;s here with le&s;s trouble perhaps than in any other part of the world: every manufac|ture is managed by the Chine&s;e, who &s;ell the produce of their labour to the merchant, re&s;ident here, for they are permitted to &s;ell it to no one el&s;e; &s;o that when a &s;hip comes in, and be&s;peaks perhaps an hundred leagers of arrack, or any quan|tity of other commodities, the merchant has nothing to do but to &s;end orders to his Chine&s;e, to &s;ee them delivered on board: he obeys the command, brings a receipt &s;igned by the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip for the goods to his employer, who receives the money, and having deducted his profit, pays the Chine&s;e his demand. With goods that are imported, however, the merchant has a little more trouble, for the&s;e he mu&s;t examine, receive, and lay up in his warehou&s;e, according to the practice of other countries.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e are called by the natives <HI>Oran&s;erane,</HI> or Nazareen men, (Oran, being Man in the language of the country) to di&s;tingui&s;h them from other Europeans; yet they are included in the general appellation of <HI>Caper,</HI> or <HI>Caf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI> an opprobrious term, applied by Mahometans to all who do not profe&s;s their faith. The&s;e people, however, are Portugue&s;e only in name; they have renounced the religion of Rome, and become Lutherans: neither have they the lea&s;t communication with the country of their forefathers, or even knowledge of it: they &s;peak indeed a corrupt dialect of the Portugue&s;e language, but much more frequently u&s;e the Malay: they are never &s;uf|fered to employ them&s;elves in any but mean occupations: ma|ny of them live by hunting, many by wa&s;hing linen, and &s;ome are handycraft&s;men and artificers. They have adopted all the cu&s;toms of the Indians, from whom they are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed chiefly by their features and complexion, their &s;kin being con&s;iderably darker, and their no&s;es more &s;harp; their dre&s;s is exactly the &s;ame, except in the manner of wearing their hair.</P>
<P>The Indians, who are mixed with the Dutch and Portu|gue&s;e in the town of Batavia, and the country adjacent, are not, as might be &s;uppo&s;ed, Javane&s;e, the original natives of
<PB N="220" REF="013324_0509_0F90EC9676758B28">
the i&s;land, but natives of the various i&s;lands from which the Dutch import &s;laves, and are either &s;uch as have them&s;elves been manumized, or the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e who formerly received manumi&s;&s;ion; and they are all comprehended under the general name of <HI>Oran&s;lam,</HI> or <HI>I&s;alam,</HI> &s;ignifying Believers of the true Faith. The natives of every country, however, in other re&s;pects keep them&s;elves di&s;tinct from the re&s;t, and are not le&s;s &s;trongly marked than the &s;laves by the vices or virtues of their re&s;pective nations. Many of the&s;e employ them&s;elves in the cultivation of gardens, and in &s;elling fruit and flowers. The betele and areca, which are here called <HI>Siri</HI> and <HI>Pinang,</HI> and chewed by both &s;exes and every rank in amazing quanti|ties, are all grown by the&s;e Indians: lime is al&s;o mixed with the&s;e roots here as it is in Savu, but it is le&s;s pernicious to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeth, becau&s;e it is fir&s;t &s;laked, and, be&s;ides the lime, a &s;ub|&s;tance called <HI>gambir,</HI> which is brought from the continent of India; the better &s;ort of women al&s;o add cardamum, and many other aromatics, to give the breath an agreeable &s;mell. Some of the Indians, however, are employed in fi&s;hing, and as lighter-men, to carry goods from place to place by water; and &s;ome are rich, and live with much of the &s;plendour of their country, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in the number of their &s;laves.</P>
<P>In the article of food the&s;e I&s;alams are remarkably temper|ate: it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of boiled rice, with a &s;mall proportion of buffalo, fi&s;h, or fowl, and &s;ometimes of dried fi&s;h, and dried &s;hrimps, which are brought hither from China; every di&s;h, however, is highly &s;ea&s;oned with Cayan pepper, and they have many kinds of pa&s;try made of rice flower, and other things to which I am a &s;tranger; they eat al&s;o a great deal of fruit, par|ticularly plantanes.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding their general temperance, their fea&s;ts are plentiful, and, according to their manner, magnificent. As they are Mahometans, wine and &s;trong liquors profe&s;&s;edly make no part of their entertainment, neither do they often indulge with them privately, contenting them&s;elves with their betele and opium.</P>
<P>The principal &s;olemnity among them is a wedding, upon which occa&s;ion both the families borrow as many ornaments of gold and &s;ilver as they can, to adorn the bride and bridegroom, &s;o that their dre&s;&s;es are very &s;howy and magnificent. The fea&s;ts that are given upon the&s;e occa&s;ions among the rich, la&s;t &s;ometimes a fortnight, and &s;ometimes longer; and during this time, the man, although married on the fir&s;t day, is by the women, kept from his wife.</P>
<P>The language that is &s;poken among all the&s;e people, from what place &s;oever they originally came, is the Malay; at lea&s;t it is a language &s;o called, and probably it is a very corrupt dialect of that &s;poken at Malacca. Every little i&s;land indeed has a
<PB N="221" REF="013324_0510_0F90F1DB27F994E0">
language of its own, and Java has two or three, but this lingua franca is the only language that is now &s;poken here, and, as I am told, it prevails over a great part of the Ea&s;t Indies. A dictionary of Malay and Engli&s;h was publi&s;hed in London by Thomas Bowrey, in the year 1701.</P>
<P>Their women wear as much hair as can grow upon the head, and to increa&s;e the quantity, they u&s;e oils, and other prepa|ratious of various kinds. Of this ornament Nature has been very liberal; it is univer&s;ally black, and is formed into a kind of circular wreath upon the top of the head, where it is fa&s;tened with a bodkin, in a ta&s;te which we thought inexpre&s;&s;ibly elegant: the wreath of hair is &s;urrounded by another of flowers, in which the Arabian je&s;&s;amine is beautifully intermixed with the golden &s;tars of the <HI>Bonger Tanjong.</HI></P>
<P>Both &s;exes con&s;tantly bathe them&s;elves in the river at lea&s;t once a day, a practice which, in this hot country, is equally nece&s;&s;ary both to per&s;onal delicacy and health. The teeth of the&s;e people al&s;o, whatever they may &s;uffer in their colour by chewing betele, are an object of great attention: the ends of them, both in the upper and under jaw, are rubbed with a kind of whet&s;tone, by a very trouble&s;ome and painful operation, till they are perfectly even and flat, &s;o that they cannot lo&s;e le&s;s than half a line in their length. A deep groove is then made cro&s;s the teeth of the upper jaw, parallel with the gums, and in the middle between them and the extremity of the teeth; the depth of its groove is at lea&s;t equal to one-fourth of the thickne&s;s of the teeth, &s;o that it penetrates far beyond what is called the enamel, the lea&s;t injury to which, according to the denti&s;ts of Europe, is fatal; yet among the&s;e people, where the practice of thus wounding the enamel is univer&s;al, we never &s;aw a rotten tooth; nor is the blackne&s;s a &s;tain, but a covering, which may be wa&s;hed off at plea&s;ure, and the teeth then appear as white as ivory, which however is not an excellence in the e&s;timation of the belles and beaus of the&s;e nations.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the people among whom the practice that is called <HI>a mock,</HI> or running a muck, has prevailed for time immemorial. It is well known, that to run a muck in the original &s;en&s;e of the word, is to get intoxicated with opium, and then ru&s;h into the &s;treet with a drawn weapon, and kill whoever comes in the way, till the party is him&s;elf either killed or taken pri&s;oner; of this &s;everal in&s;tances happened while we were at Batavia, and one of the officers, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, among other things, to apprehend &s;uch people, told us, that there was &s;carcely a week in which he, or &s;ome of his brethren, were not called upon to take one of them into cu&s;tody. In one of the in&s;tances that came to our knowledge, the party had been &s;everely in|jured by the perfidy of women, and was mad with jealou&s;y before he made him&s;elf drunk with opium; and we were told,
<PB N="222" REF="013324_0511_0F8FFB5B95C43460">
that the Indian who runs a muck is always fir&s;t driven to de&s;par|ation by &s;ome outrage, and always fir&s;t revenges him&s;elf upon tho&s;e who have done him wrong: we were al&s;o told, that though the&s;e unhappy wretches afterwards run into the &s;treet with a weapon in their hand, frantic and foaming at the mouth, yet they never kill any but tho&s;e who attempt to apprehend them, or tho&s;e whom they &s;u&s;pect of &s;uch an intention, and that whoever gives them way is &s;afe. They are generally &s;laves, who indeed are more &s;ubject to in&s;ults, and lea&s;t able to obtain legal redre&s;s: freemen, however, are &s;ometimes pro|voked into this extravagance, and one of the per&s;ons who run a muck while we were at Batavia, was free and in ea&s;y circum|&s;tances. He was jealous of his own brother, whom he fir&s;t killed, and afterwards two others, who attempted to oppo&s;e him: he did not, however, come out of his hou&s;e, but en|deavoured to defend him&s;elf in it, though the opium had &s;o far deprived him of his &s;en&s;es, that of three mu&s;quets, which he attempted to u&s;e again&s;t the officers of ju&s;tice, not one was either loaded or primed. If the officer takes one of the&s;e amocks, or mohawks, as they have been called by an ea&s;y corruption, alive, his reward is very con&s;iderable, but if he kills them, nothing is added to his u&s;ual pay; yet &s;uch is the fury of their de&s;peration, that three out of four are of nece&s;&s;ity de&s;troyed in the attempt to &s;ecure them, though the officers are provided with in&s;truments like large tongs, or pincers, to lay hold of them without coming within the reach of their weapon. Tho&s;e who happen to be taken alive are generally wounded, but they are always broken alive upon the wheel, and if the phy&s;ician who is appointed to examine their wounds, thinks them likely to be mortal, the puni&s;hment is inflicted immediately, and the place of execution is generally the &s;pot where the fir&s;t murder was committed.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e people, there are many ab&s;urd practices and opinions which they derive from their Pagan ance&s;tors: they believe that the devil, whom they call Satan, is the cau&s;e of all &s;ickne&s;s and adver&s;ity, and for this rea&s;on, when they are &s;ick, or in di&s;tre&s;s, they con&s;ecrate meat, money, and other things to him as a propitiation. If any one among them is re&s;tle&s;s, and dreams for two or three nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, he con|cludes that Satan has taken that method of laying his com|mands upon him, which if he neglects to fulfil, he will cer|tainly &s;uffer &s;ickne&s;s or death, though they are not revealed with &s;ufficient per&s;picuity to a&s;certain their meaning: to interpret his dream, therefore, he taxes his wits to the uttermo&s;t, and if, by taking it literally or figuratively, directly or by contraries, he can put no explanation upon it that perfectly &s;atisfies him, he has recour&s;e to the cawin or prie&s;t, who a&s;&s;i&s;ts him with a comment and illu&s;trations, and perfectly reveals the my&s;terious
<PB N="223" REF="013324_0512_0F90F1DBB79D2AD8">
&s;ugge&s;tions of the night. It generally appears that the devil wants victuals or money, which are always allotted him, and being placed on a little plate of cocoa-nut leaves, are hung upon the branch of a tree near the river, &s;o that it &s;eems not to be the opinion of the&s;e people, that in prowling the earth the devil "walketh through dry places." Mr. Banks once a&s;ked, whether they thought Satan &s;pent the money, or eat the victuals; he was an&s;wered, that as to the money it was con&s;idered rather as a mulct upon an offender, than a gift to him who had enjoined it, and that therefore if it was de|voted by the dreamer, it mattered not into who&s;e hands it came, and they &s;uppo&s;ed that it was generally the prize of &s;ome &s;tranger who wandered that way; but as to the meat they were clearly of opinion that, although the devil did not eat the gro&s;s parts, yet, by bringing his mouth near it, he &s;ucked out all its favour without changing its po&s;ition, &s;o that afterwards it was as ta&s;tele&s;s as water.</P>
<P>But they have another &s;uper&s;titious opinion that is &s;till more unaccountable. They believe that women, when they are de|livered of children, are frequently at the &s;ame time delivered of a young crocodile, as a twin to the infant: they believe that the&s;e creatures are received mo&s;t carefully by the midwife, and immediately carried down to the river, and put into the water. The family in which &s;uch a birth is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened, con&s;tantly put victuals into the river for their amphibious rela|tion, and e&s;pecially the twin, who, as long as he lives, goes down to the river at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, to fulfil this fraternal duty, for the neglect of which it is the univer&s;al opinion that he will be vi&s;ited with &s;ickne&s;s or death. What could at fir&s;t produce a notion &s;o extravagant and ab&s;urd, it is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s, e&s;pecially as it &s;eems to be totally unconnected with any reli|gious my&s;tery, and how a fact which never happened, &s;hould be pretended to happen every day, by tho&s;e who cannot be deceived into a belief of it by appearances, nor have any ap|parent intere&s;t in the fraud, is a problem &s;till more difficult to &s;olve. Nothing however can be more certain than the firm believe of this &s;trange ab&s;urdity among them, for we had the concurrent te&s;timony of every Indian who was que&s;tioned about it, in its favour. It &s;eems to have taken its ri&s;e in the i&s;lands of Celebes and Bouto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, where many of the inhabitants keep crocodiles in their families; but however that be, the opinion has &s;pread over all the ea&s;tern i&s;lands, even to Timor and Ce|ram, and we&s;tward as far as Java and Sumatra, where, how|ever, young crocodiles are, I believe never kept.</P>
<P>The&s;e crocodile twins are called <HI>Sudaras,</HI> and I &s;hall relate one of the innumerable &s;tories that were told us, in proof of their exi&s;tence, from ocular demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>A young female &s;lave, who was born and bred up among the
<PB N="224" REF="013324_0513_0F8FFB5C4C3D1268">
Engli&s;h at Bencoolen, and had learnt a little of the language, told Mr. Banks that her father, when he was dying, acquainted her that he had a crocodile for his <HI>&s;udara,</HI> and &s;olemnly charged her to give him meat when he &s;hould be dead, telling her in what part of the river he was to be found, and by what name he was to be called up. That in pur&s;uance of her father's in|&s;tructions and command, &s;he went to the river, and &s;tanding upon the bank, called out <HI>Radja Pouti,</HI> white king, upon which a crocodile came to her out of the water, and eat from her hand the provi&s;ions that &s;he had brought him. When &s;he was de&s;ired to de&s;cribe this paternal uncle, who in &s;o &s;trange a &s;hape had taken up his dwelling in the water, &s;he &s;aid, that he was not like other crocodiles, but much hand&s;omer; that his body was &s;potted and his no&s;e red; that he had bracelets of gold upon his feet, and earrings of the &s;ame metal in his ears. Mr. Banks heard this tale of ridiculous fal&s;ehood patiently to the end, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the girl, without reminding her, that a crocodile with ears was as &s;trange a mon&s;ter as a dog with a cloven foot. Some time after this a &s;ervant whom Mr. Banks had hired at Batavia, and who was the &s;on of a Dutch|man by a Javane&s;e woman, thought fit to acquaint his ma&s;ter that he had &s;een a crocodile of the &s;ame kind, which had al&s;o been &s;een by many others, both Dutchmen and Malays: that being very young, it was but two feet long, and had bracelets of gold upon its feet. There is no giving credit to the&s;e &s;tories, &s;aid Mr. Banks, for I was told the other day that a crocodile had earrings; and you know that could not be true, becau&s;e crocodiles have no ears. Ah Sir, &s;aid the man, the&s;e Sudara Oran are not like other crocodiles; they have five toes upon each foot, a large tongue that fills their mouth, and ears al&s;o, although they are indeed very &s;mall.</P>
<P>How much of what the&s;e people related they believed, cannot be known; for there are no bounds to the credulity of ignorance and folly. In the girl's relation, however, there are &s;ome things in which &s;he could not be deceived; and therefore mu&s;t have been guilty of wilful fal&s;ehood. Her father might perhaps give her a charge to feed a crocodile, in con&s;equence of his believing that it was his Sudara; but its coming to her out of the river, when &s;he called it by the name of White King, and taking the food &s;he had brought it, mu&s;t have been a fable of her own in|vention; for this being fal&s;e, it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he &s;hould believe it to be true. The girl's &s;tory, however, as well as that of the man, is a &s;trong proof that they both firmly believed the exi&s;tence of crocodiles that are Sudaras to men; and the girl's fiction will be ea&s;ily accounted for, if we recollect, that the earne&s;t de&s;ire which every one feels to make others believe what he believes him&s;elf, is a &s;trong temptation to &s;upport it by unju&s;tifiable evidence. And the averring what is known to
<PB N="225" REF="013324_0514_0F90F1DC78AC4148">
be fal&s;e, in order to produce in others the belief of what is thought to be true, mu&s;t, upon the mo&s;t charitable principles, be imputed to many, otherwi&s;e venerable characters, through who&s;e hands the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity pa&s;&s;ed for many ages in their way to us, as the &s;ource of all the &s;illy fables related of the Romi&s;h &s;aints, many of them not le&s;s extravagant and ab|&s;urd than this &s;tory of the White King, and all of them the invention of the fir&s;t relater.</P>
<P>The Bougis, Maca&s;&s;ars, and Boetons, are &s;o firmly per|&s;uaded that they have relations of the crocodile &s;pecies in the rivers of their own country, that they perform a periodical cere|mony in remembrance of them. Large parties of them go out in a boat, furni&s;hed with great plenty of provi&s;ions, and all kinds of mu&s;ic, and row backwards and forwards, in places where crocodiles and allegators are mo&s;t common, &s;inging and weep|ing by turns, each invoking his kindred, till a crocodile ap|pears, when the mu&s;ic in&s;tantly &s;tops, and provi&s;ions, betele, and tobacco are thrown into the water. By this civility to the &s;pecies, they hope to recommend them&s;elves to their relations at home; and that it will be accepted in&s;tead of offerings immediately to them&s;elves, which it is not in their power to pay.</P>
<P>In the next rank to the Indians &s;tand the Chine&s;e, who in this place are numerous, but po&s;&s;e&s;s very little property; many of them live within the walls, and keep &s;hops. The fruit-&s;ellers of Pa&s;&s;ar Pi&s;&s;ang have been mentioned already; but others have a rich &s;how of European and Chine&s;e goods: the far greater part however live in a quarter by them&s;elves, with|out the walls, called Campang China. Many of them are carpenters, joiners, &s;miths, taylors, &s;lipper makers, dyers of cotton, and embroiderers; maintaining the character of in|du&s;try that is univer&s;ally given of them: and &s;ome are &s;cattered about the country, where they cultivate gardens, &s;ow rice and &s;ugar, or keep cattle and buffaloes, who&s;e milk they bring daily to town.</P>
<P>There is nothing clean or dirty, hone&s;t or di&s;hone&s;t, pro|vided there is not too much danger of a halter, that the Chi|ne&s;e will not readily do for money. But though they work with great diligence, and patiently undergo any degree of labour; yet no &s;ooner have they laid down their tools than they begin to game, either at cards or dice, or &s;ome other play among the multitude that they have invented, which are al|together unknown in Europe: to this they apply with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, as &s;carcely to allow time for the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;h|ments of food and &s;leep; &s;o that it is rare to &s;ee a Chine&s;e idle, as it is to &s;ee a Dutchman or an Indian employed.</P>
<P>In manners they are always civil, or rather ob&s;equious; and in dre&s;s they are remarkably neat and clean, to whatever rank
<PB N="226" REF="013324_0515_0F8FFB5D1DF23AB0">
of live they belong. I &s;hall not attempt a de&s;cription either of their per&s;ons or habits, for the better kind of China paper, which is now common in England, exhibits a perfect repre&s;en|tation of both, though perhaps with &s;ome &s;light exaggerations approaching towards the caricatura.</P>
<P>In eating they are ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, though the few that are rich have many &s;avory di&s;hes. Rice, with a &s;mall proportion of fle&s;h or fi&s;h, is the food of the poor; and they have greatly the advantage of the Mahometan Indians, who&s;e religion for|bids them to eat of many things which they could mo&s;t ea&s;ily procure. The Chine&s;e, on the contrary, being under no re|&s;traint, eat, be&s;ides pork, dogs, cats, frogs, lizards, &s;erpents of many kinds, and a great variety of &s;ea animals, which the other inhabitants of this country do not con&s;ider as food: they eat al&s;o many vegetables, which an European, except he was peri&s;hing with hunger, would never touch.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have a &s;ingular &s;uper&s;tition with regard to the burial of their dead; for they will upon no occa&s;ion open the ground a &s;econd time, where a body has been interred. Their burying grounds, therefore, in the neighbourhood of Batavia, cover many hundred acres, and the Dutch, grudging the wa&s;te of &s;o much land, will not &s;ell any for this purpo&s;e but at the mo&s;t exorbitant price. The Chine&s;e, however, contrive to rai&s;e the purcha&s;e money, and afford another in&s;tance of the folly and weakne&s;s of human nature, in transferring a regard for the living to the dead, and making that the object of &s;o|licitude and expence, which cannot receive the lea&s;t benefit from either. Under the influence of this univer&s;al prejudice, they take an uncommon method to pre&s;erve the body intire, and prevent the remains of it from being mixed with the earth that &s;urrounds it. They inclo&s;e it in a large thick coffin of wood, not made of planks joined together, but hollowed out of the &s;olid timber, like a canoe; this being covered, and let down into the grave, is &s;urrounded with a coat of their mor|tar, called Chinam, about eight or ten inches thick, which in a &s;hort time becomes as hard as a &s;tone. The relations of the decea&s;ed attend the funeral ceremony, with a con&s;iderable number of women that are hired to weep; it might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that the hired appearance of &s;orrow could no more flatter the living than benefit the dead; yet the appearance of &s;orrow is known to be hired among people more reflective and enlightened than the Chine&s;e. In Batavia, the law requires that every man &s;hould be buried according to his rank, which is in no ca&s;e di&s;pen&s;ed with; &s;o that if the decea&s;ed has not left &s;ufficient to pay his debts, an officer takes an inventory of what was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion when he died, and out of the pro|duce buries him in the manner pre&s;cribed, leaving only the overplus to his creditors. Thus in many in&s;tances are the liv|ing
<PB N="227" REF="013324_0516_0F90F1DD4D7C54E0">
&s;acrificed to the dead, and money that &s;hould di&s;charge a debt, or feed an orphan, lavi&s;hed in idle proce&s;&s;ions, or ma|terials that are depo&s;ited in the earth to rot.</P>
<P>Another numerous cla&s;s among the inhabitants of this country is the &s;laves; for by &s;laves the Dutch, Portugue&s;e, and Indians, however different in their rank or &s;ituation, are con&s;tantly attended: they are purcha&s;ed from Sumatra, Ma|lacca, and almo&s;t all the ea&s;tern i&s;lands. The natives of Ja|va, very few of whom, as I have before ob&s;erved, live in the neighbourhood of Batavia, have an exemption from &s;lavery under the &s;anction of very &s;evere penal laws, which I believe are &s;eldom violated. The price of the&s;e &s;laves is from ten to twenty pounds &s;terling; but girls, if they have beauty, &s;ome|times fetch a hundred. They are a very lazy &s;et of people; but as they will do but little work, they are content with a little victuals, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting altogether upon boiled rice, and a &s;mall quantity of the cheape&s;t fi&s;h. As they are natives of different countries, they differ from each other extremely, both in per&s;on and di&s;po&s;ition. The African negroes, called here <HI>Papua,</HI> are the wor&s;t, and con&s;equently may be purcha&s;ed for the lea&s;t money: they are all thieves, and all incorrigible. Next to the&s;e are the Bougis and Maca&s;&s;ars, both from the i&s;land of Celebes; the&s;e are lazy in the highe&s;t degree, and though not &s;o much addicted to theft as the negroes, have a cruel and vindictive &s;pirit, which renders them extremely dangerous; e&s;pecially as, to gratify their re&s;entment, they will make no &s;cruple of &s;acrificing life. The be&s;t &s;laves, and con&s;equently the deare&s;t, are procured from the i&s;land of Bali: the mo&s;t beautiful women from Nias, a &s;mall i&s;land on the coa&s;t of Sumatra; but they are of a tender and delicate con|&s;titution, and &s;oon fall a &s;acrifice to the unwhole&s;ome air of Batavia. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are Malays, and &s;laves of &s;e|veral other denominations, who&s;e particular characteri&s;tic I do not remember.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;laves are wholly in the power of their ma&s;ters with re&s;pect to any puni&s;hment that does not take away life; but if a &s;lave dies in con&s;equence of puni&s;hment, though his death &s;hould not appear to have been intended, the ma&s;ter is called to a &s;evere account, and he is generally condemned to &s;uffer capitally. For this rea&s;on the ma&s;ter &s;eldom inflicts puni&s;h|ment upon the &s;lave him&s;elf, but applies to an officer called a Marineu, one of whom is &s;tationed in every di&s;trict. The du|ty of the Marineu is to quell riots, and take offenders into cu&s;|tody; but more particularly to apprehend runaway &s;laves, and puni&s;h them for &s;uch crimes as the ma&s;ter, &s;upported by proper evidence, lays to their charge: the puni&s;hment how|ever is not inflicted by the Marineu in per&s;on, but by &s;laves who are bred up to the bu&s;ine&s;s. Men are puni&s;hed publicly,
<PB N="228" REF="013324_0517_0F8FFB5E470B0A20">
before the door of their ma&s;ter's hou&s;e; but women within it. The puni&s;hment is by &s;tripes, the number being proportioned to the offence; and they are given with rods made of ratans, which are &s;plit into &s;lender twigs for the purpo&s;e, and fetch blood at every &s;troke. A common puni&s;hment co&s;ts the ma&s;|ter a rixdollar, and a &s;evere one a ducatoon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, about &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence. The ma&s;ter is al&s;o obliged to allow the &s;lave three dubblecheys, equal to about &s;even pence half-pen|ny a week, as an encouragement, and to prevent his being under temptations to &s;teal too &s;trong not to be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Concerning the government of this place I can &s;ay but little. We ob&s;erved however a remarkable &s;ubordination among the people. Every man who is able to keep hou&s;e has a certain &s;pecific rank acquired by the length of his &s;ervices to the company; the different ranks which are thus acquired are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the ornaments of the coaches and the dre&s;&s;es of the coachmen: &s;ome are obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o ride in plain coaches, &s;ome are allowed to paint them in different manners and degrees, and &s;ome to gild them. The coachman al&s;o appears in clothes that are quite plain, or more or le&s;s adorned with lace.</P>
<P>The officer who pre&s;ides here has the title of Governor Gene|ral of the Indies, and the Dutch Governors of all the other &s;ettlements are &s;ubordinate to him, and obliged to repair to Batavia that he may pa&s;s their accounts. If they appear to have been criminal, or even negligent, he puni&s;hes them by delay, and detains them during plea&s;ure, &s;ometimes one year, &s;ometimes two years, and &s;ometimes three; for they cannot quit the place till he gives them a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. Next to the Governor are the members of the council, called here <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">le Heeren,</HI> and by the corruption of the Engli&s;h <HI>Idoleers.</HI> The&s;e Idoleers take upon them &s;o much &s;tate that whoever meets them in a carriage, is expected to ri&s;e up and bow, then to drive on one &s;ide of the road, and there &s;top till they are pa&s;t: the &s;ame homage is re|quired al&s;o to their wives and even their children; and it is commonly paid them by the inhabitants. But &s;ome of our Cap|tains have thought &s;o &s;lavi&s;h a mark of re&s;pect beneath the dig|nity which they derived from the &s;ervice of his Britannic Ma|je&s;ty, and have refu&s;ed to pay it; yet, if they were in a hired carriage, nothing could deter the coachman from honouring the Dutch Grandee at their expence, but the mo&s;t peremptory menace of immediate death.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered here by a body of lawyers, who have ranks of di&s;tinction among them&s;elves. Concerning their pro|ceedings in que&s;tions of property, I know nothing; but their deci&s;ions in criminal ca&s;es &s;eem to be &s;evere with re&s;pect to the natives, and lenient with re&s;pect to their own people, in a criminal degree. A Chri&s;tian always is indulged with an op|portunity of e&s;caping before he is brought to a trial, whatever
<PB N="229" REF="013324_0518_0F8FFB5EB43B4EB0">
may have been his offence; and if he is brought to a trial and convicted, he is &s;eldom puni&s;hed with death: while the poor Indians on the contrary are hanged, and broken upon the wheel, and even impaled alive without mercy.</P>
<P>The Malays and Chine&s;e have judicial officers of their own, under the denominations of Captains and Lieutenants, who determine in civil ca&s;es, &s;ubject to an appeal to the Dutch court.</P>
<P>The taxes paid by the&s;e people to the Company are very con&s;iderable; and that which is exacted of them for liberty to wear their hair, is by no means the lea&s;t. They are paid monthly, and to &s;ave the trouble and charge of collecting them, a flag is hoi&s;ted upon the top of a hou&s;e, in the middle of the town, when a payment is due; and the Chine&s;e have experienced it their intere&s;t to repair thither, with their mo|ney, without delay.</P>
<P>The money current here con&s;i&s;ts of ducats, worth a hundred and thirty-two &s;tivers; ducatoons, eighty &s;tivers; imperial rixdollars, &s;ixty; rupees of Batavia, thirty; &s;chellings, &s;ix; double cheys, two &s;tivers and a half; and doits, one fourth of a &s;tiver. Spani&s;h dollars, when we were here, were at five &s;hillings and five pence; and we were told, that they were never lower than five &s;hillings and four pence, even at the Company's ware-hou&s;e. For Engli&s;h Guineas we could never get more than nineteen &s;hillings upon an average; for though the Chine&s;e would give twenty &s;hillings for &s;ome of the brighte&s;t, they would give no more than &s;eventeen &s;hillings for tho&s;e that were much worn.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be of &s;ome advantage to &s;trangers to be told that there are two kinds of coin here, of the &s;ame denomina|tion, milled and unmilled, and that the milled is of mo&s;t va|lue. A milled ducatoon is worth eighty &s;tivers; but an un|milled ducatoon is worth no more than &s;eventy-two. All ac|counts are kept in rix-dollars and &s;tivers, which, here at lea&s;t, are mere nominal coins, like our pound &s;terling. The rix-dollar is equal to forty-eight &s;tivers, about four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence Engli&s;h currency.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. The Pa&s;&s;age from Batavia to the Cape of Good Hope: Some Account of Prince's I&s;land and its Inhabitants, and a compa|rative View of their Language with the Malay and Javane&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>ON Thur&s;day the 27th of December at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we weighed again and &s;tood out to &s;ea.
<PB N="230" REF="013324_0519_0F90F1DDFB78CEC8">
After much delay by contrary winds, we weathered Pulo Pare on the 29th, and &s;tood in for the main; &s;oon after we fetched a &s;mall i&s;land under the main, in the midway between Ba|tavia and Bantam, called Maneater's I&s;land. The next day, we weathered fir&s;t Wapping i&s;la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and then Pulo Babi. On the 31&s;t, we &s;tood over to the Sumatra &s;hore; and on the morning of New Year's day, 1771, we &s;tood over for the Java &s;hore.</P>
<P>We continued our cour&s;e as the wind permitted us till three o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th, when we anchored under the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of Prince's I&s;land in eighteen fathom, in order to recruit our wood and water, and procure refre&s;hments for the &s;ick, many of whom were now become much wor&s;e than they were when we left Batavia. As &s;oon as the &s;hip was &s;ecured, I went a&s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and we were met upon the beach by &s;ome In|dians, who carried us immediately to a man, who, they &s;aid, was their King. After we had exchanged a few compliments with his Maje&s;ty, we proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s; but in &s;ettling the price of turtle we could not agree: this however did not di&s;|courage us, as we made no doubt but that we &s;hould buy them at our own price in the morning. As &s;oon as we parted, the Indians di&s;per&s;ed, and we proceeded along the &s;hore in &s;earch of a watering-place. In this we were more &s;ucce&s;sful; we found water very conveniently &s;ituated, and, if a little care was taken in filling it, we had rea&s;on to believe that it would prove good. Ju&s;t as we were going off, &s;ome Indians, who remained with a canoe upon the beach, &s;old us three turtle; but exacted a promi&s;e of us that we &s;hould not tell the King.</P>
<P>The next morning, while a party was employed in filling water, we renewed our traffic for turtle: at fir&s;t, the Indians dropped their demands &s;lowly, but about noon, they agreed to take the price that we offered, &s;o that before night we had turtle in plenty: the three that we had purcha&s;ed the even|ing before, were in the mean time &s;erved to the &s;hip's com|pany, who, till the day before, had not once been &s;erved with &s;alt provi&s;ions from the time of our arrival at Savu, which was now near four months. In the evening Mr. Banks went to pay his re&s;pects to the King, at his palace, in the middle of a rice-field, and though his Maje&s;ty was bu&s;ily employed in dre&s;&s;ing his own &s;upper, he received the &s;tranger very gra|ciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The next day, the natives came down to the trading-place, with fowls, fi&s;h, monkies, &s;mall beer, and &s;ome vegetables, but no turtle, for they &s;aid that we had bought them all the day before. The next day, however, more turtle appeared at market, and &s;ome were brought down every day afterwards,
<PB N="231" REF="013324_0520_0F90F1DEC9D5F990">
during our &s;tay, though the whole, together, was not equal to the quantity that we bought the day after our arrival.</P>
<P>On the 11th, Mr. Banks having learnt from the &s;ervant whom he had hired at Batavia, that the Indians of this i&s;land had a town upon the &s;hore, at &s;ome di&s;tance to the we&s;tward, he determined to &s;ee it: with this view he &s;et out in the morning, accompanied by the &s;econd lieutenant, and as he had &s;ome rea&s;on to think that his vi&s;it would not be agreeable to the inhabitants, he told the people whom he met, as he was advancing along the &s;hore, that he was in &s;earch of plants, which indeed was al&s;o true. In about two hours they arrived at a place where there were four or five hou&s;es, and meeting with an old man, they ventured to make &s;ome enquiries concerning the town. He &s;aid that it was far di&s;|tant; but they were not to be di&s;couraged in their enterpri&s;e, and he, &s;eeing them proceed in their journey, joined company and went on with them. He attempted &s;everal times to lead them out the way, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and at length they came within &s;ight of the hou&s;es. The old man then entered cordially into their party, and conducted them into the town. The name of it is Samodang, it con&s;i&s;ts of about four hundred hou&s;es, and is divided by a river of bracki&s;h water into two parts, one of which is called the old town, and the other the new. As &s;oon as they entered the old town, they met &s;eve|ral Indians whom they had &s;een at the trading-place, and one of them undertook to carry them over to the new town, at the rate of two pence a head. When the bargain was made, two very &s;mall canoes were produced, in which they embarked; the canoes being placed along &s;ide of each other, and held together, a precaution which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to prevent their over&s;etting, the navigation was at length &s;afely performed, though not without &s;ome difficulty; and when they landed in the new town, the people received them with great friend&s;hip, and &s;howed them the hou&s;es of their Kings and principal people, which are in this di&s;trict: few of them however were open, for at this time the people had taken up their re&s;idence in the rice-grounds, to defend the crop again&s;t the birds and monkies, by which it would other|wi&s;e have been de&s;troyed. When their curio&s;ity was &s;atisfied, they hired a large &s;ailing boat for two roupees, four &s;hillings, which brought them back to the &s;hip time enough to dine upon one of the &s;mall deer, weighing only forty pounds, which had been bought the day before, and proved to be very good and &s;avory meat.</P>
<P>We went on &s;hore in the evening, to &s;ee how the people who were employed in wooding and watering went on, and were informed that an ax had been &s;tolen. As the pa&s;&s;ing over this fault might encourage the commi&s;&s;ion of others of the
<PB N="232" REF="013324_0521_0F8FFB5F4CE13DC0">
&s;ame kind, application was immediately made to the King, who after &s;ome altercation promi&s;ed that the ax &s;hould be re|&s;tored in the morning; and kept his word, for it was brought to us by a man who pretended that the thief, being afraid of a di&s;covery, had privately brought it, and left it at his hou&s;e in the night.</P>
<P>We continued to purcha&s;e between two and three hundred weight of turtle in a day, be&s;ides fowls and other nece&s;&s;aries; and in the evening of the 13th, having nearly completed our wood and water, Mr. Banks went a&s;hore to take leave of his Maje&s;ty, to whom he had made &s;everal trifling pre&s;ents, and at parting gave him two quires of paper, which he graciou&s;ly received. They had much conver&s;ation, in the cour&s;e of which his Maje&s;ty enquired, why the Engli&s;h did not touch there as they had been u&s;ed to do. Mr. Banks replied, that he &s;uppo&s;ed it was becau&s;e they found a deficiency of turtle, of which there not being enough to &s;upply one &s;hip, many could not be expected. To &s;upply this defect, he advi&s;ed his Maje&s;|ty to breed cattle, buffaloes, and &s;heep, a mea&s;ure which he did not &s;eem much inclined to adopt.</P>
<P>On the 14th we made ready to &s;ail, having on board a good &s;tock of refre&s;hments, which we purcha&s;ed of the natives, con|&s;i&s;ting of turtle, fowl, fi&s;h, two &s;pecies of deer, one as big as a &s;heep, the other not larger than a rabit; with cocoa-nuts, plantains, limes, and other vegetables. The deer however &s;erved only for pre&s;ent u&s;e, for we could &s;eldom keep one of them alive more than four and twenty hours after it was on board. On our part the trade was carried on chiefly with Spa|ni&s;h dollars, the natives &s;eeming to &s;et little value upon any thing el&s;e; &s;o that our people, who had a general permi&s;&s;ion to trade, parted with old &s;hirts and other articles, which they were obliged to &s;ub&s;titute for money to great di&s;advantage. In the morning of the 15th we weighed, with a light breeze at N. E. and &s;tood out to &s;ea. Java Head, from which I took my departure, lies in latitude 6&deg; 49&prime; S., longitude 253&deg; 12&prime; W.</P>
<P>Prince's I&s;land, where we lay about ten days, is, in the Malay language called <HI>Pulo Selan;</HI> and in the language of the inhabitants, <HI>Pulo Paneitan.</HI> It is a &s;mall i&s;land, &s;ituated in the we&s;tern mouth of the Streight of Sunda. It is woody, and a very &s;mall part of it only has been cleared: there is no re|markable hill upon it, yet the Engli&s;h call the &s;mall eminence which is ju&s;t over the landing-place the pike. It was formerly much frequented by the India &s;hips of many nations, but e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of England, which of late have for&s;aken it, as it is &s;aid, becau&s;e the water is bad; and touch either at North I&s;land, a &s;mall i&s;land that lies on the coa&s;t of Sumatra, without the ea&s;t entrance of the Streight, or at New Bay, which lies
<PB N="233" REF="013324_0522_0F90F1E040DFC140">
only a few leagues from Prince's I&s;land, at neither of which places any con&s;iderable quantity of other refre&s;hments can be procured. Prince's I&s;land is, upon the whole, certainly more eligible than either of them; and though the water is bracki&s;h, if it is filled at the lower part of the brook, yet higher up it will be found excellent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and &s;econd, and perhaps the third &s;hip that comes in the &s;ea&s;on may be tolerably &s;upplied with turtle; but tho&s;e that come afterwards mu&s;t be content with &s;mall ones. Tho&s;e that we bought were of the green kind, and at an average co&s;t us about a half-penny or three farthings a pound. We were much di&s;appointed to find them neither fat nor well flavoured; and we imputed it to their having been long kept in crawls or pens of bracki&s;h water, without food. The fowls are large, and we bought a dozen of them for a Spani&s;h dollar, which is about five pence a piece: the &s;mall deer co&s;t us two pence a piece, and the larger, of which two only were brought down, a rupee. Many kinds of fi&s;h are to be had here, which the natives &s;ell by hand, and we found them tolerably cheap. Cocoa-nuts we bought at the rate of a hundred for a dollar, if they were picked; and if they were taken promi&s;cuou&s;ly, one hundred and thirty. Plantains we found in great plenty; we procured al&s;o &s;ome pine apples, water melons, jaccas, and pumpkins; be&s;ides rice, the greater part of which was of the mountain kind, that grows in dry land; yams, and &s;everal other vegetables, at a very rea&s;onable rate.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are Javane&s;e, who&s;e Raja is &s;ubject to the Sultan of Bantam. Their cu&s;toms are very &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Indians about Batavia; but they &s;eem to be more jealous of their women, for we never &s;aw any of them during all the time that we were there, except one by chance in the woods, as &s;he was running away to hide her&s;elf. They profe&s;s the Mahome|tan religion, but I believe there is not a mo&s;que in the whole i&s;land: we were among them during the fa&s;t, which the Turks call <HI>Ramadan,</HI> which they &s;eemed to keep with great rigour, for not one of them would touch a mor&s;el of victuals, or even chew their betele till &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>Their food is nearly the &s;ame as that of the Batavian Indians, except the addition of the nuts of the palm, called <HI>Cyca circi|nalis,</HI> with which, upon the coa&s;t of New Holland, &s;ome of our people were made &s;ick, and &s;ome of our hogs poi&s;oned.</P>
<P>Upon ob&s;erving the&s;e nuts to be part of their food, we en|quired by what means they deprived them of their deleterious quality; and they told us, that they fir&s;t cut them into thin &s;lices, and dried them in the &s;un, then &s;teeped them in fre&s;h water for three months, and afterwards, pre&s;&s;ing out the water, dried them in the &s;un a &s;econd time; but we learnt that, after all, they are eaten only in times of &s;carcity, when they mix them with their rice to make it go farther.</P>

The hou&s;es of their town are built upon piles, or pillars, four or five feet above the ground: upon the&s;e is laid a floor of bamboo canes, which are placed at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, &s;o as to leave a free pa&s;&s;age for the air from below: the walls al&s;o are of bamboo, which are interwoven, hurdlewi&s;e, with &s;mall &s;ticks, that are fa&s;tened perpendicularly to the beams which form the frame of the building: it has a &s;loping roof, which is &s;o well thatched with palm leaves, that neither the &s;un nor the rain can find entrance. The ground over which this building is erected, is an oblong &s;quare. In the middle of one &s;ide is the door, and in the middle between that and the end of the hou&s;e, towards the left hand, is a window: a partition runs out from each end towards the middle, which, if conti|nued, would divide the whole floor into two equal parts, lon|gitudinally, but they do not meet in the middle, &s;o that an opening is left over-again&s;t the door; each end of the hou&s;e therefore, to the right and left of the door, is divided into two rooms, like &s;talls in a &s;table, all open towards the pa&s;&s;age from the door to the wall on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide: in that next the door, to the left hand, the children &s;leep; that oppo&s;ite to it, on the right hand, is allotted to &s;trangers; the ma&s;ter and his wife &s;leep in the inner room on the left hand, and that oppo&s;ite to it is the kitchen. There is no difference between the hou&s;es of the poor and the rich, but in the &s;ize; except that the royal palace, and the hou&s;e of a man, who&s;e name is <HI>Gundang,</HI> the next in riches and influence to the King, is walled with boards in&s;tead of being wattled with &s;ticks and bamboo.</P>
<P>As the people are obliged to abandon the town, and live in the rice-fields at certain &s;ea&s;ons, to &s;ecure their crops from the birds and the monkies, they have occa&s;ional hou&s;es there for their accommodation. They are exactly the &s;ame as the hou&s;es in the town, except that they are &s;maller, and are elevated eight or ten feet above the ground in&s;tead of four.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the people, as far as we could di&s;cover it, is good. They dealt with us very hone&s;tly, except, like all other Indians, and the itinerant retailers of fi&s;h in London, they a&s;ked &s;ometimes twice, and &s;ometimes thrice as much for their commodities as they would take. As what they brought to market, belonged, in different proportions, to a con&s;iderable number of the natives, and it would have been difficult to pur|cha&s;e it in &s;eperate lots, they found out a very ea&s;y expedient with which every one was &s;atisfied: they put all that was bought of one kind, as plantains, or cocoa-nuts, together, and when we had agreed for the heap, they divided the money that was paid for it, among tho&s;e of who&s;e &s;eparate property it con&s;i&s;ted, in a proportion corre&s;ponding with their contributions. Some|times, indeed, they changed our money, giving us 240 doits, amounting to five &s;hillings, for a Spani&s;h dollar, and ninety-&s;ix, amounting to two &s;hillings, for a Bengal roupee.</P>

They all &s;peak the Malay language, though they have a lang|uage of their own, different both from the Malay and the Javane&s;e. Their own language they call <HI>Catta Gunung,</HI> the language of the mountains; and they &s;ay that it is &s;poken upon the moun|tains of Java, whence their tribe originally migrated, fir&s;t to New Bay, and then to their pre&s;ent &s;tation, being driven from their fir&s;t &s;ettlement by tygers, which they found too numerous to &s;ubdue. I have already ob&s;erved, that &s;everal languages are &s;poken by the native Javane&s;e, in different parts of their i&s;land; but when I &s;ay that the language of the&s;e people is different from the Javane&s;e, I mean that it is different from the language which is &s;poken at Samarang, a place that is di&s;tant only one day's journey from the re&s;idence of the emperor of Java.

Indies, and the i&s;lands of the South Sea, conjectures may be formed with re&s;pect to the peopling tho&s;e countries, which cannot ea&s;ily be referred to Madaga&s;car. The inhabitants of Java and Madaga&s;car appear to be a different race; the Javane&s;e is of an olive complexion, and has long hair; the native of Madaga&s;car is black, and his head is not covered with hair, but wool; and yet perhaps this will not conclude again&s;t their having common ance&s;tors &s;o &s;trongly as at fir&s;t ap|pears. It does not &s;eem le&s;s difficult to account for the per&s;onal difference between a native of England and France, as an effect of mere local &s;ituation, than for the difference between the natives of Java and Madaga&s;car; yet it has never been &s;uppo&s;ed, that England and France were not peopled from common an|ce&s;tors. If two natives of England marry in their own country, and afterwards remove to our &s;ettlements in the We&s;t Indies, the children that are conceived and born there will have the complexion and ca&s;t of countenance that di&s;tingui&s;h the Creole; if they return, the children conceived and born afterwards, will have no &s;uch characteri&s;tics. If it be &s;aid that the mother's mind being impre&s;&s;ed with different external obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cts, impre&s;&s;es corre&s;pending features and complexion upon the child during her pregnancy, it will be as difficult to refer the effect into this cau&s;e, upon mere phy&s;ical principles, as into the other; for it can no more be &s;hewn how a mere idea, conceived in the mother's imagination, can change the corporeal form of her infant, than how its form can be changed by mere local &s;itua|tion. We know that people within the &s;mall circle of Great Britain and Ireland, who are born at the di&s;tance of two or three hundred miles from each other, will be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Scotch face, the Wel&s;h face, and the Iri&s;h face; may we not then rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that there are in nature qualities which act powerfully as efficient cau&s;es, and yet are not cog|nizable by any of the five modes of perception which we call &s;en&s;es? A deaf man, who &s;ees the &s;tring of a harp&s;ichord vibrate, when a corre&s;ponding tone is produced by blowing into a flute at a di&s;tance, will &s;ee an effect of which he can no more con|ceive the cau&s;e to exi&s;t in the blowing air into the flute, than we can conceive the cau&s;e of the per&s;onal difference of the various inhabitants of the globe to exi&s;t in mere local &s;ituation; nor can he any more form an idea of the cau&s;e it&s;elf, in one ca&s;e, than we can in the other: what happens to him then, in con|&s;equence of having but four &s;en&s;es in&s;tead of five, may, with re&s;pect to many phaenomena of nature, happen to us, in con|&s;equence of having but five &s;en&s;es in&s;tead of &s;ix, or any greater number.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly, however, the learning of ancient AEgypt might run in two cour&s;es, one through Africa, and the other through A&s;ia, di&s;&s;eminating the &s;ame words in each, e&s;pecially terms

of number, which might thus become part of the language of people who never had any communication with each other.</P>
<P>We now made the be&s;t of our way for the Cape of Good Hope, but the &s;eeds of di&s;ea&s;e which we had received at Bata|via began to appear with the mo&s;t threatning &s;ymptons in dy|&s;enteries and &s;low fevers. Le&s;t the water which we had taken in at Prince's I&s;land &s;hould have had any &s;hare in our &s;ickne&s;s, we purified it with lime, and we wa&s;hed all parts of the &s;hip between decks with vinegar, as a remedy again&s;t infection. Mr. Banks was among the &s;ick, and for &s;ome time there was no hope of his life. We were very &s;oon in a mo&s;t deplorable &s;itu|ation; the &s;hip was nothing better than an ho&s;pital, in which tho&s;e that were able to go about, were too few to attend the &s;ick, who were confined to their hammocks; and we had almo&s;t every night a dead body to commit to the &s;ea. In the cour&s;e of about &s;ix weeks, we buried Mr. Sporing, a gentleman who was in Mr. Banks's retinue, Mr. Parkin&s;on, his natural hi&s;tory painter, Mr. Green the a&s;tronomer, the boat&s;wain, the carp|enter and his mate, Mr. Monkhou&s;e the mid&s;hipman, who had fothered the &s;hip after &s;he had been &s;tranded on the coa&s;t of New Holland, our old jolly &s;ail-maker and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, the &s;hip's cook, the corporal of the marines, two of the carpenter's crew, a mid&s;hipman, and nine &s;eamen; in all three and twenty per&s;ons, be&s;ides the &s;even that we buried at Batavia.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Our Arrival at the Cape of Good Hope; &s;ome Remarks on the Run from Java Head to that Place; a De&s;cription of the Cape, and of Saint Helena: With &s;ome Account of the Hottentots, and the Return of the Ship to England.</HEAD>
<P>ON Friday the 15th of March, about ten o'clock in the morning, we anchored off the Cape of Good Hope, in &s;even fathom with an ouzey bottom. The we&s;t point of the bay, called the Lion's Tail, bore W. N. W. and the ca&s;tle S. W. di&s;tant about a mile and a half. I immediately waited upon the Governor, who told me that I &s;hould have every thing the country afforded. My fir&s;t care was to provide a proper place a&s;hore for the &s;ick, which were not a few; and a hou&s;e was &s;oon found, where it was agreed they &s;hould be lodged and boarded at the rate of two &s;hillings a head per day.</P>
<P>Our run from Java head, to this place, afforded very few &s;ubjects of remark that can be of u&s;e to future navigators; &s;uch as occurred, however, I &s;hall &s;et down. We had left Java Head eleven days before we got the general &s;outh ea&s;t trade-wind, during which time, we did not advance above 5&deg; to the &s;outh|ward,
<PB N="239" REF="013324_0528_0F90F1E335F86800">
and 3&deg; to the we&s;t, having variable light airs, interrupted by calms, with &s;ultry weather, and an unwhole&s;ome air, oc|ca&s;ioned probably by the load of vapours which the ea&s;tern trade-wind, and we&s;terly mon&s;oons, bring into the&s;e latitudes, both which blow in the&s;e &s;eas at the time of year when we happened to be there. The ea&s;terly wind prevails as far as 10 or 12&deg; S. and the we&s;terly as far as 6 or 8&deg;; in the intermediate &s;pace the winds are variable, and the air, I believe, always unwhole&s;ome; it certainly aggravated the di&s;ea&s;es which we brought with us from Batavia, and particularly the flux, which was not in the lea&s;t degree checked by any medicine, &s;o that whoever was &s;eized with it, con&s;idered him&s;elf as a dead man; but we had no &s;ooner got into the trade-wind, than we began to feel its &s;alutary effects: we buried indeed &s;everal of our people afterwards, but they were &s;uch as had been taken on board in a &s;tate &s;o low and feeble that there was &s;carcely a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of their recovery. At fir&s;t we &s;u&s;pected that this dreadful di&s;order might have been brought upon us by the water that we took on board at Prince's I&s;land, or even the turtle that we bought there; but there is not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to believe that this &s;u&s;picion was well grounded, for all the &s;hips that came from Batavia at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, &s;uffered in the &s;ame degree, and &s;ome of them even more &s;everely, though none of them touched at Prince's I&s;land in their way.</P>
<P>A few days after we left Java, we &s;aw boobies about the &s;hip for &s;everal nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and as the&s;e birds are known to roo&s;t every night on &s;hore, we thought them an indication that &s;ome i&s;land was not far di&s;tant; perhaps it might be the i&s;land of Selam, which, in different charts, is very differently laid down both in name and &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The variation of the compa&s;s off the we&s;t coa&s;t of Java is about 3&deg; W, and &s;o it continued without any &s;en&s;ible variation, in the common track of &s;hips to the longitude of 288&deg; W. lati|tude 22 S. after which it increa&s;ed apace, &s;o that in longitude 295&deg;, latitude 23&deg;, the variation was 10&deg; 20&prime; W. in &s;even degrees more of longitude, and one of latitude, it increa&s;ed two degrees; in the &s;ame &s;pace, farther to the we&s;t, it in|crea&s;ed five degrees: in latitude 28&deg;, longitude 314&deg;, it was 24&deg; 20&prime;, in latitude 29&deg; longitude 317&deg;, it was 26&deg; 10&prime;, and was then &s;tationary for the &s;pace of about ten degrees farther to the we&s;t; but in latitude 34&deg;, longitude 333&deg;, we ob&s;erved it twice to be 28&deg; &frac14; W. and this was its greate&s;t variation, for in latitude 35&deg; &frac12;, longitude 337&deg;, it was 24&deg;, and continued gradually to decrea&s;e; &s;o that off Cape Anguillas it was 22&deg; 30&prime;, and in Table Bay 20&deg; 30&prime; W.</P>
<P>As to currents it did not appear that they were at all con|&s;iderable, till we came within a little di&s;tance of the meridian of Madaga&s;car; for after we had made 52&deg; of longitude from
<PB N="240" REF="013324_0529_0F8FFB61D0E783C0">
Java Head, we found, by ob&s;ervation, that our error in longi|tude was only two degrees, and it was the &s;ame when we had made only nineteen. This error might be owing partly to a current &s;etting to the we&s;tward, partly to our not making proper allowances for the &s;etting of the &s;ea before which we run, and perhaps to an error in the a&s;&s;umed longitude of Java Head. If that longitude is erroneous, the error mu&s;t be imputed to the imperfection of the charts of which I made u&s;e in reducing the longitude from Batavia, to that place, for there can be no doubt but that the longitude of Batavia is well determined. After we had pa&s;&s;ed the longitude of 307&deg;, the effects of the we&s;terly currents began to be con&s;iderable; for in three days, our error in longitude was 1&deg; 5: the velocity of the current kept in|crea&s;ing, as we proceeded to the we&s;tward, in &s;o much that for five days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively after we made the land, we were driven to the S. W. or S. W. by W. not le&s;s than twenty leagues a day; and this continued till we were within &s;ixty or &s;eventy leagues of the Cape, where the current &s;et &s;ometimes one way, and &s;ometimes the other, though inclining rather to the we&s;t|ward.</P>
<P>After the boobies had left us, we &s;aw no more birds till we got nearly a brea&s;t of Madaga&s;car, where, in latitude 27&deg; &frac34; S. we &s;aw an albatro&s;s, and after that time we &s;aw them every day in great numbers, with birds of &s;everal other &s;orts, particularly one about as big as a duck, of a very dark brown colour, with a yellowi&s;h bill. The&s;e birds became more numerous as we approached the &s;hore, and as &s;oon as we got into &s;oundings we &s;aw gannets, which we continued to &s;ee as long as we were upon the bank which &s;tretches off Anguillas to the di&s;tance of forty leagues, and extends along the &s;hore to the ea&s;tward, from Cape Fal&s;e, according to &s;ome charts, one hundred and &s;ixty leagues. The real extent of this bank is not exactly known; it is however u&s;eful as a direction to &s;hipping when to haul in, in order to make the land.</P>
<P>While we lay here, the Houghton Indiaman &s;ailed for England, who, during her &s;tay in India, lo&s;t by &s;ickne&s;s be|tween thirty and forty men; and when &s;he left the Cape had many in a helple&s;s condition with the &s;curvy. Other &s;hips &s;uffered in the &s;ame proportion, who had been little more than twelve months ab&s;ent from England; our &s;ufferings therefore were comparatively light, con&s;idering that we had been ab&s;ent near three times as long.</P>
<P>Having lain here to recover the &s;ick, procure &s;tores, and per|form &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary operations upon the &s;hip and rigging, till the 13th of April, I then got all the &s;ick on board, &s;everal of whom were &s;till in a dangerous &s;tate, and having taken leave of the Governor, I unmoored the next morning, and got ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="013324_0530_0F8FFB6291F398A8">
The Cape of Good Hope has been &s;o often de&s;cribed, and is &s;o well known in Europe, that I &s;hall mention only a few par|ticulars, which in other relations are omitted or mi&s;repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid to the contrary, no country that we &s;aw during the voyage makes a more forlorn appearance, or is in reality a more &s;terile de&s;art. The land over the cape, which con&s;titutes the penin&s;ula formed by Table Bay on the north, and Fal&s;e Bay on the &s;outh, con&s;i&s;ts of high mountains, altogether naked and de&s;olate: the land behind the&s;e to the ea&s;t, which may be con&s;idered as the i&s;thmus, is a plain of va&s;t extent, con&s;i&s;ting almo&s;t wholly of a light kind of &s;ea &s;and, which produces nothing but heath, and is utterly in|capable of cultivation. All the &s;pots that will admit of im|provement, which together bear about the &s;ame proportion to the whole as one to one thou&s;and, are laid out in vineyards, orchards, and kitchen grounds; and mo&s;t of the&s;e little &s;pots lie at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other. There is al&s;o the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that in the interior parts of this country, that which is capable of cultivation does not bear a greater proportion to that which is incorrigibly barren; for the Dutch told us, that they had &s;ettlements eight and twenty days journey up the country, a di&s;tance equal to at lea&s;t nine hundred miles, from which they bring provi&s;ions to the Cape by land; &s;o that it &s;eems rea&s;onable to conclude that provi|&s;ions are not to be had within a le&s;s compa&s;s. While we were at the Cape, a farmer came thither from the country, at the di&s;tance of fifteen days journey, and brought his young child|ren with him. We were &s;urpri&s;ed at this, and a&s;ked him, if it would not have been better to have left them with his next neighbour: Neighbour! &s;aid the man, I have no neighbour within le&s;s than five days journey of me. Surely the country mu&s;t be deplorably barren in which tho&s;e who &s;ettle only to rai&s;e provi&s;ions for a market, are di&s;per&s;ed at &s;uch di&s;tances from each other. That the country is every where de&s;titute of wood appears to demon&s;tration; for timber and planks are im|ported from Batavia, and fuel is almo&s;t as dear as food. We &s;aw no tree, except in plantations near the town, that was &s;ix feet high; and the &s;tems that were not thicker than a man's thumb, had roots as thick as an arm or leg; &s;uch is the in|fluence of winds here to the di&s;advantage of vegetation, &s;etting the &s;terility of the &s;oil out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The only town which the Dutch have built here is, from its &s;ituation, called Cape Town, and con&s;i&s;ts of about a thou|&s;and hou&s;es, neatly built of brick, and in general whited on the out&s;ide; they are however covered only with thatch, for the violence of the &s;outh ea&s;t winds would render any other roof inconvenient and dangerous. The &s;treets are broad and commodious, all cro&s;&s;ing each other at right angles. In the
<PB N="242" REF="013324_0531_0F90F1E3F99FD8A8">
principal &s;treet there is a canal, on each &s;ide of which is plant|ed a row of oaks, that have flouri&s;hed tolerably well, and yield an agreeable &s;hade: there is a canal al&s;o in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> other part of the town, but the &s;lope of the ground in the cour&s;e of both is &s;o great, that they are furni&s;hed with flood-gates, or locks, at intervals of little more than fifty yards.</P>
<P>A much greater proportion of the inhabitants are Dutch in this place than in Batavia; and as the town is &s;upported prin|cipally by entertaining &s;trangers, and &s;upplying them with nece&s;&s;aries, every man, to a certain degree, imitates the man|ners and cu&s;toms of the nation with which he is chiefly con|cerned. The ladies however are &s;o faithful to the mode of their country, that not one of them will &s;tir without a chaud|pied or chauffet, which is carried by a &s;ervant, that it may be ready to place under her feet whenever &s;he &s;hall &s;it down. This practice is the more remarkable, as very few of the&s;e chauffets have fire in them, which indeed the climate renders unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The women in general are very hand&s;ome; they have fine clear &s;kins, and a bloom of colour that indicates a purity of con&s;titution, and high health. They make the be&s;t wives in the world, both as mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of a family and mothers; and there is &s;carcely a hou&s;e that does not &s;warm with children.</P>
<P>The air is &s;alutary in a high degree; &s;o that tho&s;e who bring di&s;ea&s;es hither from Europe, generally recover perfect health in a &s;hort time; but the di&s;ea&s;es that are brought from India are not &s;o certainly cured.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the natural &s;terility of the climate, indu&s;|try has &s;upplied this place with all the nece&s;&s;aries, and even the luxuries of life in the greate&s;t profu&s;ion. The beef and mutton are excellent, though the cattle and &s;heep are natives of the country; the cattle are lighter than ours, more neatly made, and have horns that &s;pread to a much wider extent. The &s;heep are cloathed with a &s;ub&s;tance between wool &amp; hair, and have tails of an enormous &s;ize; we &s;aw &s;ome that weighed twelve pounds, and were told that there were many much larger. Good butter is made of the milk of the cows, but the chee&s;e is very much inferior to our own. Here are goats, but they are never eaten, hogs, and a variety of poultry. Hares are al&s;o found here, exactly like tho&s;e of Europe; antelopes of many kinds, quails of two &s;orts, and bu&s;tards, which are well flavoured, but not juicy. The fields produce European wheat and barley, and the gardens European vegetables, and fruit of all kinds, be&s;ides plantains, guavas, jambu, and &s;ome other Indian fruits, but the&s;e are not in perfection; the plan|tains in particular, are very bad, and the guavas no larger than goo&s;eberries. The vineyards al&s;o produce wine of va|rious &s;orts, but not equal to tho&s;e of Europe, except the Con|&s;tantia,
<PB N="243" REF="013324_0532_0F90F1E4D24E14B8">
which is made genuine only at one vineyard, about ten miles di&s;tant from the town. There is another vineyard near it, where wine is made that is called by the &s;ame name, but it is greatly inferior.</P>
<P>The common method in which &s;trangers live here, is to lodge and board with &s;ome of the inhabitants, many of who&s;e hou&s;es are always open for their reception: the rates are from five &s;hillings to two &s;hillings a day, for which all nece&s;&s;aries are found. Coaches may be hired at four and twenty &s;hillings a day, and hor&s;es at &s;ix &s;hillings; but the country affords very little temptation to u&s;e them. There are no public entertain|ments: and tho&s;e that are private, to which &s;trangers, of the rank of Gentlemen are always admitted, were &s;u&s;pended while we were there by the breaking out of the mea&s;les.</P>
<P>At the farther end of the high &s;treet, the Company have a garden, which is about two thirds of an Engli&s;h mile long; the whole is divided by walks that inter&s;ect each other at right angles, and are planted with oaks that are clipt into wall hedges, except in the center walk, where they are &s;uffered to grow to their full &s;ize, and afford an agreeable &s;hade, which is the more welcome, as, except the plantations by the &s;ides of the two canals, there is not a &s;ingle tree that would &s;erve even for a &s;hepherd's bu&s;h, within many miles of the town. The greater part of this garden is kitchen ground; but two &s;mall &s;quares are allotted to botanical plants, which did not appear to be &s;o numerous by one half as they were when Oldenland wrote his catalogue. At the farther end of the garden is a menagerie, in which there are many birds and bea&s;ts that are never &s;een in Europe; particularly a bea&s;t called by the Hot|tentots <HI>Coe Doe,</HI> which is as large as a hor&s;e, and has the fine &s;piral horns which are &s;ometimes &s;een in private and public collections of curio&s;ities.</P>
<P>Of the natives of this country, we could learn but little, except from report; for there were none of their habitations, where alone they retain their original cu&s;toms, within le&s;s than four days journey from the town; tho&s;e that we &s;aw at the Cape were all &s;ervants to Dutch farmers, who&s;e cattle they take care of, and are employed in other drudgery of the meane&s;t kind. The&s;e are in general of a &s;lim make, and ra|ther lean than plump, but remarkably &s;trong, nimble, and active. Their &s;ize is nearly the &s;ame with that of Europeans, and we &s;aw &s;ome that were &s;ix feet high: their eyes are dull and without expre&s;&s;ion: their &s;kins are of the colour of &s;oot, but that is in a great mea&s;ure cau&s;ed by dirt, which is &s;o wrought into the grain that it cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from complexion; for I believe they never wa&s;h any part of their bodies. Their hair curls &s;trongly, not like a negroe's, but falls in ringlets about &s;even or eight inches long. Their
<PB N="244" REF="013324_0533_0F90F1E58401C5A8">
clothing con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;kin, generally that of a &s;heep, thrown over their &s;houlders; be&s;ides which, the men wear a &s;mall pouch in the middle of the wai&s;t, and the women, a broad leather flap, both which hang from a girdle, or belt, that is adorned with beads, and &s;mall pieces of copper. Both men and women wear necklaces, and &s;ometimes bracelets, of beads; and the women wear rings of hard leather round their ancles, to defend them from the thorns, with which their country every where abounds: &s;ome of them have a &s;andal, made of wood or bark; but the greater part of them are un&s;hed.</P>
<P>To a European, their language appears to be &s;carcely arti|culate; be&s;ides which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a very remarkable &s;ingularity. At very frequent intervals, while they are &s;peak|ing, they cluck with their tongue again&s;t the roof of the mouth: the&s;e clucks do not appear to have any meaning, but rather to divide what they &s;ay into &s;entences. Mo&s;t of the&s;e Hottentots &s;peak Dutch, without any peculiarity of pronun|ciation.</P>
<P>They are all mode&s;t, even to &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s; for it was not without the greate&s;t difficulty that we could per&s;uade any of them to dance, or even to &s;peak in their own language to each other, in our pre&s;ence. We did however both &s;ee them dance, and hear them &s;ing; their dances are by turns active and &s;luggi&s;h to exce&s;s; &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;ting of quick and vio|lent motions, with &s;trange di&s;tortions of the body, and un|natural leaps backwards and forwards, with the legs cro&s;&s;ing each other; and being &s;ometimes &s;o &s;piritle&s;s that the dancer only &s;trikes the ground fir&s;t with one foot, and then with the other, neither changing place, nor moving any other part of his body: the &s;ongs al&s;o are alternately to quick and &s;low movements, in the &s;ame extremes as the dance.</P>
<P>We made many enquiries concerning the&s;e people of &s;he Dutch, and the following particulars are related upon the credit of their report.</P>
<P>Within the boundaries of the Dutch &s;ettlements there are &s;everal nations of the&s;e people, who very much differ from each other in their cu&s;toms and manner of life: all however are friendly and peaceable, except one clan that is &s;ettled to the ea&s;tward, which the Dutch call <HI>Bo&s;ch men,</HI> and the&s;e live entirely by plunder, or rather by che&s;t; for they never attack their neighbours openly, but &s;teal the cattle privately in the night. They are armed however to defend them&s;elves, if they happen to be detected, with lances or a&s;&s;agays, and ar|rows, which they know how to poi&s;on by various ways, &s;ome with the juice of herbs, and &s;ome with the venom of the &s;er|pent called <HI>Cobra di Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lo;</HI> in the hands of the&s;e people a &s;tone al&s;o is a very formidable weapon, for they can throw it
<PB N="245" REF="013324_0534_0F90F1E638582DD8">
with &s;uch force and exactne&s;s as repeatedly to hit a dollar at the di&s;tance of a hundred paces. As a defence again&s;t the&s;e free-booters, the other Indians train up balls, which they place round their towns in the night, and which, upon the approach of either man or bea&s;t, will a&s;&s;emble and oppo&s;e them, till they hear the voice of their ma&s;ters encouraging them to fight, or calling them off, which they obey with the &s;ame docility as a dog.</P>
<P>Some nations have the art of melting and preparing copper, which is found among them, probably native; and of this they make broad plates, which they wear as ornaments upon their foreheads. Some of them al&s;o know how to harden bits of iron, which they procure from the Dutch, and form into knives, &s;o as to give them a temper &s;uperior to that of any they can buy.</P>
<P>The Chiefs, many of whom are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of very nume|rous herds of cattle, are generally clad in the &s;kins of lions, tygers, or zebras, to which they add fringes, and other or|naments in a very good ta&s;te. Both &s;exes frequently anoint the body with grea&s;e, but never u&s;e any that is rancid or foe|tid, if fre&s;h can be had. Mutton &s;uet and butter are generally u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e; butter is preferred, which they make by &s;haking the milk in a bag made of the &s;kin of &s;ome bea&s;t.</P>
<P>We were told that the prie&s;t certainly gives the nuptial be|nediction by &s;prinkling the bride and bridegroom with his urine. But the Dutch univer&s;ally declared that the women never wrapped the entrails of &s;heep round heir legs, as they have been &s;aid to do, and afterwards make them part of their food. Semica&s;tration was al&s;o ab&s;olutely denied to be gene|ral; but it was acknowledged that &s;ome among the particular nation which knew how to melt copper had &s;uffered that ope|ration, who were &s;aid to be the be&s;t warriors, and particu|larly to excel in the art of throwing &s;tones.</P>
<P>We were very de&s;irous to determine the great que&s;tion among natural hi&s;torians, whether the women of this country have or have not that fle&s;hy flap or apron which has been cal|led the <HI>Sinus pudoris;</HI> and what we learnt I &s;hall relate. Ma|ny of the Dutch and Malays', who &s;aid they had received fa|vours from Hottentots women, po&s;itively denied its exi&s;tence; but a phy&s;ician of the place declared that he had cured many hundred of venereal complaints, and never &s;aw one without two fle&s;hy, or rather &s;kinny appendages, proceeding from the upper part of the <HI>Labia,</HI> in appearance &s;omewhat re&s;embling the te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of a cow, but flat; they hung down, he &s;aid, before the <HI>Pudendum,</HI> and were in different &s;ubjects of different lengths, in &s;ome not more than half an inch, in others three or four inches: the&s;e he imagined to be what &s;ome writers have exaggerated into a flap, or apron, hanging down from
<PB N="246" REF="013324_0535_0F90F1E711F6D4C8">
the bottom of the abdomen, of &s;ufficient extent to render an ar|tificial covering of the neighbouring parts unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Thus much for the country, its productions, and inhabi|tants. The bay is large, &s;afe, and commodious; it lies open indeed to the north we&s;t winds, but they &s;eldom blow hand; yet as they &s;ometimes &s;end in a great &s;ea, the &s;hips moor N. E. and S. W. &s;o as to have an open haw&s;er with north we&s;t winds: the &s;outh ea&s;t winds blow frequently with great violence, but as this direction is right out of the bay, they are not dan|gerous. Near the town a wharf of wood is run out to a proper di&s;tance, for the convenience of landing and &s;hipping goods. To this wharf water is conveyed in pipes, from which &s;eve|ral boats may fill water at the &s;ame time; and &s;everal large boats or hoys are kept by the Company to carry &s;tores and provi&s;ions to and from the &s;hipping in the harbour. The bay is defended by a &s;quare &s;ort, &s;ituated clo&s;e to the beach on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town, and by &s;everal outworks and batteries extending along the &s;hore, as well on this &s;ide of the town as the other; but they are &s;o &s;ituated as to be cannonaded by &s;hipping, and are in a manner defencele&s;s again&s;t an enemy of any force by land. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of eight hundred re|gular troops, be&s;ides militia of the country, in which is com|prehended every man able to bear arms. They have con|trivances to alarm the whole country by &s;ignals in a very &s;hort time, and the militia is then to repair immediately to the town.</P>
<P>The French, at Mauritins, are &s;upplied from this place with &s;alted beef, bi&s;cuit, flour, and wine: the provi&s;ions for which the French contracted this year were 500,000 lb. weight of &s;ale beef, 400,000 lb. of flour, 400,000 lb. of bi&s;|cuit, and 1,200 leagers of wine.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 14, we weighed and &s;tood out of the bay; and at five in the evening anchored under Penquin, or Robin I&s;land: we lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all night, and as I could not &s;ail in the morning for want of wind, I &s;ent a boat to the i&s;land for a few trifling articles which we had forgot to take in at the Cape. But as &s;oon as the boat came near the &s;hore, the Dutch hailed her, and warned the people not to land at their peril, bringing down at the &s;ame time fix armed men with Mu&s;quets, who paraded upon the beach. The officer who commanded the boat, not thinking it worth while to ri&s;k the lives of the people on board for the &s;ake of a few cabbages, which were all we wanted, returned to the &s;hip. At fir&s;t we were at a lo&s;s to account for our repul&s;e, but we afterwards re|collected, that to this i&s;land the Dutch at the Cape bani&s;h &s;uch criminals as are not thought worthy of death, for a cer|tain number of years, proportioned to the offence; and em|ploy them as &s;laves in digging line-&s;tone, which though

&s;carce upon the continent is plenty here: and that a Dani&s;h &s;hip, which by &s;ickne&s;s had lo&s;t great part of her crew, and had been refu&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the Cape, came down to this i&s;land, and &s;ending her boat a&s;hore, &s;ecured the guard, and took on board as many of the criminals as &s;he thought proper to navigate her home: we concluded therefore that the Dutch, to prevent the re&s;cue of their criminals in time to come, had given order to their people here to &s;uffer no boat of any fo|reign nation to come a&s;hore.</P>
<P>On the 25th, at three o'clock in the afternoon, we weigh|ed, with a light breeze at S. E. and put to &s;ea. About an hour afterwards, we lo&s;t our Ma&s;ter, Mr. Robert Mollineux, a young man of good parts, but unhappily given to intem|perance, which brought on di&s;orders that put an end to his life.</P>
<P>We proceeded in our voyage homeward without any re|markable incident; and in the morning of the 29th, we cro&s;&s;ed our fir&s;t meridian, having circumnavigated the globe in the direction from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and con&s;equently lo&s;t a day, for which we made an allowance at Batavia.</P>
<P>At day-break, on the 1&s;t of May, we &s;aw the i&s;land of St. Helena; and at noon, we anchored in the road before James's Fort.</P>
<P>We &s;taid here till the 4th, to refre&s;h, and Mr. Banks im|proved the time in making the complete circuit of the i&s;land, and vi&s;iting the mo&s;t remarkable places upon it.</P>
<P>It is &s;ituated as it were in the middle of the va&s;t Atlantic ocean, being four hundred leagues di&s;tant from the coa&s;t of Africa, and &s;ix hundred from that of America. It is the &s;um|mit of an immen&s;e mountain ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea, which, at a little di&s;tance all round it, is of an unfathomable depth, and is no more than twelve leagues long and &s;ix broad.</P>
<P>The &s;eat of volcanoes has, without exception, been found to be the highe&s;t part of the countries in which they are found. AEtna and Ve&s;uvius have no land higher than them|&s;elves, in their neighbourhood; Hecla is the highe&s;t hill in Iceland; volcanoes are frequent in the highe&s;t part of the Andes in South America; and the pike of Teneriffe is known to be the covering of &s;ubterraneous fire: the&s;e are &s;till burn|ing, but there are innumerable other mountains which bear evident marks of fire that is now extinct, and has been &s;o from the time of our earlie&s;t traditions: among the&s;e is Saint Helena, where the inequalities of the ground, in its external &s;urface, are manife&s;tly the effect of the &s;inking of the earth, for the oppo&s;ite ridges, though &s;eparated always by deep, and &s;ometimes by broad vallies, are exactly &s;imilar both in appearance and direction; and that the &s;inking of the earth in the&s;e parts, was cau&s;ed by &s;ubterraneous fire, is equally

manife&s;t from the &s;tones, for &s;ome of them, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the bottom of the vallies, are burnt a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;t to a cinder: in &s;ome there are &s;mall bubbles, like tho&s;e that are &s;een in gla&s;s which has been urged almo&s;t to fu&s;ion, and &s;ome, though at fir&s;t &s;ight they do not appear to have been expo&s;ed to the action of great heat, will be found, upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection, to con|tain &s;mall pieces of extraneous bodies, particularly mundick, which have yielded to the power of fire, though it was not &s;uf|ficient to alter the appearance of the &s;tone which contained them.</P>
<P>It appeared, as we approached it on the windward &s;ide, like a rude heap of rocks, bounded by precipices of amazing height, and con&s;i&s;ting of a kind of half friable &s;tone, which &s;hows not the lea&s;t &s;ign of vegetation; nor is it more pro|mi&s;ing upon a nearer view: in &s;ailing along the &s;hore, we came &s;o near the huge cliffs, that they &s;eemed to over-hang the &s;hip, and the tremendous effect of their giving way, made us almo&s;t fear the event: at length we opened a valley, called Chappel Valley, which re&s;embles a large trench; and in this valley we di&s;covered the town. The bottom of it is &s;lightly covered with herbage, but the &s;ides are as naked as the cliffs that are next the &s;ea. Such is the fir&s;t appearance of the i&s;land in its pre&s;ent cultivated &s;tate, and the fir&s;t hills mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed before the vallies look green, or the country di&s;plays any other marks of fertility.</P>
<P>The town &s;tands ju&s;t by the &s;ea-&s;ide, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar greater part of the hou&s;es are ill built; the church, which originally was a mean &s;tructure, is in ruins, and the market-hou&s;e is nearly in the &s;ame condition.</P>
<P>The white inhabitants are all Engli&s;h, who, as they are not permitted by the Ea&s;t India Company, to whom the i&s;land belongs, to carry on any trade or commerce on their own ac|count, &s;ub&s;i&s;t wholly by &s;upplying &s;uch &s;hips as touch at the place with refre&s;hments, which, however, they do not pro|vide in proportion to the fertility of the &s;oil, and the tempe|rament of the climate, which would enable them, by cultiva|tion, to produce all the fruits and vegetables both of Europe and India. This i&s;land indeed, &s;mall as it is, enjoys the dif|ferent advantages of different climates, for the cabbage-trees which grow upon the highe&s;t ridges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by no art be cultivated upon the ridges next below, where the red-wood and gum-wood both flouri&s;h, which will not grow upon the ridges above, and neither of the three are to be found in the vallies, which, in general, are covered with European plants, and the more common ones of India.</P>
<P>Here are a few hor&s;es, but they are kept only for the &s;addle, &s;o that all labour is performed by &s;laves; nor are they furni&s;h|ed with any of the various machines which art has invented to facilitate their ta&s;k. The ground is not every where too &s;teep

for a ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, and where it is, the wheel-barrow might be u&s;ed with great advantage, yet there is no wheelbarrow in the whole i&s;land; every thing is conveyed from place to place by the &s;laves, and they are not furni&s;hed even with the &s;imple convenience of a porter's knot, but carry their burden upon their heads. They are indeed very numerous, and are brought almo&s;t from every part of the world, but they appeared to be a mi&s;erable race, worn out partly by exce&s;&s;ive labour, and partly by ill u&s;age, of which they frequently complained; and I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that in&s;tances of wanton cruelty are much more frequent among my countrymen here, than among the Dutch, who are, and perhaps not without rea&s;on, generally reproached with want of humanity at Batavia and the Cape.</P>
<P>Among the native products of this i&s;land, which are not numerous, mu&s;t be reckoned ebony, though the trees are now nearly extinct, and are not remembered to have been plenty: pieces of the wood are frequently found in the vallies, of a fine black colour, and a hardne&s;s almo&s;t equal to iron: the&s;e pieces, however, are always &s;o &s;hort and crooked, that no u&s;e can be made of them. Whether the tree is the &s;ame with that which produces ebony upon the i&s;le of Bourbon, or the i&s;lands adjacent, is not known, as the French have not yet publi&s;hed any account of it.</P>
<P>There are but few in&s;ects in this place, but there is a &s;pe|cies of &s;nail found upon the tops of the highe&s;t ridges, which probably has been there &s;ince the original creation of their kind, at the beginning of the world. It is indeed very diffi|cult to conceive how any thing which was not depo&s;ited here at its creation, or brought hither by the diligence of man, could find its way to a place &s;o &s;evered from the re&s;t of the world, by &s;eas of immen&s;e extent, except the hypothe&s;is that has been mentioned on another occa&s;ion be adopted, and this rock be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been left behind, when a large tract of country, of which it was part, &s;ub&s;ided by &s;ome convul&s;ion of nature, and was &s;wallowed up in the ocean.</P>
<P>At one o'clock in the afternoon, of the 4th of May, we weighed and &s;tood out of the road, in company with the Port|land man of war, and twelve &s;ail of Indiamen.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;ail in company with the fleet, till the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th in the morning, when, perceiving that we &s;ailed much heavier than any other &s;hip, and thinking it for that rea&s;on probable that the Portland would get home before us, I made the &s;ignal to &s;peak with her, upon which Captain Elliot him|&s;elf came on board, and I delivered to him a letter for the Ad|miralty, with a box, containing the common log books of the &s;hip, and the journals of &s;ome of the officers. We conti|nued in company, however, till the 23d in the morning, and then there was not one of the &s;hips in &s;ight. About one

o'clock in the afternoon, died our Fir&s;t Lieutenant Mr. Hicks, and in the evening we committed his body to the &s;ea, with the u&s;ual ceremonies. The di&s;ea&s;e of which he died, was a con&s;umption, and as he was not free from it when we &s;ailed from England, it may truly be &s;aid that he was dying during the whole voyage, though his decline was very gradual till we came to Batavia: the next day I gave Mr. Charles Clerk an order to act as Lieutenant in his room, a young man who was extremely well qualified for that &s;tation.</P>
<P>Our rigging and &s;ails were now become &s;o bad, that &s;ome|thing was giving way every day. We continued our cour&s;e, however, in &s;afety till the 10th of June, when land, which proved to be the Lizard, was di&s;covered by Nicholas Young, the &s;ame boy that fir&s;t &s;aw New Zealand; on the 11th we run up the channel, at &s;ix in the morning ef the 12th we pa&s;&s;ed Beachy Head, and at noon we were abrea&s;t of Dover, and about three came to an anchor in the Downs, and went a&s;hore at Deal.</P>
