</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter, we have an Account of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s &s;ending Spies to the Country of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> with the Report they made at their Return:&mdash;The Number of Men he &s;ent to de&s;troy that petty Kingdom:&mdash;That they fled before their Enemies, and &s;ome of them were &s;lain.</P>
<P>We are in the next Place informed of the Behaviour of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and the <HI>Elders</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> upon this Occa&s;ion: They humbled them&s;elves before God, 6 ver. <HI>For the Heart of all the People <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and became as Water,</HI> upon their hearing the News; and <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> him&s;elf was greatly alarm'd.&mdash;But the &s;ame Day at Evening they had an An&s;wer from God, in which <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was directed what Method to take, in order to find out the guilty Per&s;on, who had, by his Theft, procured the Defeat,&mdash;The Kind and Degree of his Puni&s;hment was likewi&s;e &s;pecified by the Divine Oracle at the &s;ame Time; which was executed the next Day, in the Manner pre&s;cribed, after he had been detected and convicted, 24, 25 ver. <HI>And they rai&s;ed a great Heap of Stones over him,</HI> as a Monument of God's righteous Di&s;|plea&s;ure and Severity again&s;t Sins of &s;uch a public Scandal and general Mi&s;chief to the Community, and as a Warning to all others.</P>
<P>And this was wi&s;ely order'd by God in the Beginning of their new Em|pire and Settlement in the promi&s;ed Land, to prevent the Death of great Numbers, that took Warning by this awful Example; who, if not re|&s;trained by the Fear and Love of God, from &s;uch dete&s;table and de&s;tructive
<PB N="4" REF="007583_0004_102D7F40AEF52DE0">
Practices, yet, would be, by the Fear of Puni&s;hment, and the Love of their own, and their dear Childrens Lives.</P>
<P>I &s;hall wave a particular and critical Survey of the Context, which would take up much Time to little Purpo&s;e, and proceed to the Text; in which it may be noted, That God &s;peaks to <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> with great Solemnity, and Indications of high Di&s;plea&s;ure: <HI>Up, &s;anctify the People, and &s;ay, Sanctify your&s;elves</HI>&mdash;"Ri&s;e from your Pro&s;tration&mdash;Attend the Duty incumbent on you&mdash;Put the People upon making &s;uitable Preparation to appear be|fore God&mdash;Summon them to be ready again&s;t To-morrow, and bid them &s;ee that they have no ceremonial Pollution upon them, but purify your|&s;elves from whatever is contrary to the Law in this Ca&s;e, that I may point out, before the whole Congregation, the Per&s;on that has committed the accur&s;ed Fact; and that you may all &s;ee his mo&s;t awful and exemplary Puni&s;hment.&mdash;Purify your&s;elves, for the whole Congregation is, in &s;ome Re&s;pect, polluted by this dete&s;table Thing."</P>
<P>The latter Part of the Text contains a Declaration of the Rea&s;on, why the Army that was &s;ent out could not &s;tand, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of their removing the Cau&s;e, in order to their being able, for the future, to &s;tand before, and &s;ubdue their Enemies: <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, There is an accur&s;ed Thing in the Mid&s;t of thee, O</HI> I&s;rael: <HI>Thou can&s;t not &s;tand before thine Enemies, until ye take away the accur&s;ed Thing from among you.</HI> The Sin of <HI>Achan,</HI> con&s;idered in all its Circum&s;tances, had put the whole People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> out of the Divine Protection, and was the Cau&s;e of God's with|drawing from them that Spirit of Courage and Re&s;olution, which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary in War. When that is withheld, no Warriors, tho' their natural Courage and acquired Skill be ever &s;o great, can &s;tand before the mo&s;t contemptible Foe; e&s;pecially when it is on the Account of the Violation of their Covenant-Engagements; which was then the Ca&s;e of the <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now attempt, by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to offer &s;omething agreeable to the Subject, under the following general Heads.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. When God's profe&s;&s;ing People go forth to war again&s;t their Enemies, they &s;hould be very careful to put away from among them, all their Sins; e&s;pecially that, which is emphatically, <HI>The accur&s;ed Thing in the Mid&s;t of them.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. In order to this, a diligent Inquiry ought to be made, to find out what it is.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this Duty is, <HI>That unle&s;s it be taken away, they cannot stand before their Enemies in the Day of Battle.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="007583_0005_102D7F424124CD08">IV. A particular Application &s;hall conclude the Subject.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. When God's profe&s;&s;ing People go forth to war again&s;t their Enemies, they &s;hould be very careful to put away from among them all their Sins; e&s;pecially that, which is emphatically, <HI>The Accur&s;ed Thing in the Mid&s;t of them.</HI></P>
<P>That this Duty is <HI>more e&s;pecially</HI> incumbent on tho&s;e who are favour'd with the Light of the Go&s;pel, I need not attempt to prove to a Chri&s;tian Auditory. And that God's peculiar People are often obliged, by the ill Treatment of &s;ome of their fellow Men, to go to war with them in a Way of Self-defence (which is a Duty they owe to Him, as the Author of their Being) is evident from undeniable Facts: Otherwi&s;e they would be driven out of the World by Violence; not called out by the ordinary Way of Providence; or be forced to drag out the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Lives, in the mo&s;t abject Slavery, without ta&s;ting the Sweetne&s;s of <HI>Liberty,</HI> which is common to the <HI>Human Species.</HI> And that <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> War is frequently ne|ce&s;&s;ary as well as lawful, and <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> War &s;ometimes &s;o, is con&s;picuous, not only from the Oracles of Truth, but even from the Principles of Na|ture in its degenerate State. In the Old Te&s;tament, we have diver&s;e Ac|counts of its being undertaken and engaged in, by the &s;pecial Appointment and Command of the Lord of Ho&s;ts. Nor is it any where forbidden in the New Te&s;tament, either by Chri&s;t, the Prince of Peace, who con&s;tituted and pre&s;ided over the legal, as well as the evangelical Di&s;pen&s;ation, or by his Apo&s;tles; but is implicitly approved of by them: Which it would not have been, if it had been contrary to the Spirit of the Go&s;pel, but would have been forbidden by them.</P>
<P>This being &s;o evident, I &s;hall not attempt a Vindication of it again&s;t Sophi&s;ters and Bigots; e&s;pecially as this intere&s;ting, tho' in it&s;elf, unplea|&s;ant Subject, has, of late Years, been &s;et in the mo&s;t convincing Light by the cleare&s;t Pens <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Sermons (of <HI>Philadelphia</HI>) on the Subject. And Mr. <HI>William Currie</HI>'s Vindication of the Lawfulne&s;s of de|fen&s;ive War; printed in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e Things, we come to the Point, which is, That when the Lord's People go to war, they ought to put away all their Sins, e&s;pecially that which is the Accur&s;ed Thing. The Obligation is general and binding upon all Per&s;ons, at all Times, in all Circum&s;tances, more e&s;pecially when under the Rebukes and Frowns of Providence for their
<PB N="6" REF="007583_0006_102D7F441B24D270">
Sins, as they are in a Time of War. This Di&s;pen&s;ation is a &s;olemn Call to the Practice of the Duty, which ought to be religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, e&s;pecially when there is any Thing particularly &s;pecified, as there was in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Jews</HI> at their Entrance into the Land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> The revealed Will of God is the only Rule of our Conduct, and his Authority the Rea|&s;on of our Compliance.</P>
<P>Now, by the Accur&s;ed Thing, we are to under&s;tand the Per&s;on of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">an,</HI> together with his &s;tolen Goods, as in 12 ver. And his taking the&s;e was Sacrilege, becau&s;e con&s;ecrated to the Lord&punc; <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 6 19.</P>
<P>But if it be demanded, What <HI>we,</HI> at this Day, are to under&s;tand by the Accur&s;ed Thing? How it may be taken away? And who &s;hall undertake the difficult Ta&s;k?</P>
<P>The An&s;wer to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Inquiries is, That we are to under&s;tand Sin in general, e&s;pecially that which is open and public; or tho&s;e Sins which are openly committed by Per&s;ons of Note, and by Men in Authority and Office, both Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical: And tho&s;e which are committed by the Encouragement, Approbation, and Connivance of dignified Per|&s;ons. There is an intrin&s;ic moral Evil in <HI>all</HI> Sin, e&s;pecially the la&s;t Sort, as contrary to the mo&s;t holy Nature and Law of God: For this Rea&s;on, every Sin is an Accur&s;ed Thing. For, as the Apo&s;tle argues, <HI>Sin is the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law</HI>; of that Law, which is a Tran&s;cript of the moral Perfections of God; therefore nece&s;&s;arily <HI>holy, ju&s;t, and good.</HI> And every Sin is more or le&s;s heinous, as Ca&s;es and Circum&s;tances vary, or may be alter'd for &s;pecial, prudential, or public Rea&s;ons. <HI>That Sin,</HI> therefore, which is the mo&s;t detrimental to the public Good, and the mo&s;t di&s;honorary to God, is <HI>now,</HI> and <HI>ever,</HI> to be deem'd the Accur&s;ed Thing.</P>
<P>The next Inquiry is, How this is to be taken away?</P>
<P>The An&s;wer is ea&s;y, but the Performance difficult: But it may be done by a vigorous and faithful Execution of the Laws of the Country; which is the Magi&s;trate's Province. And it &s;uppo&s;es him to be concerned only in &s;uch Things as properly come under his Cognizance. For where the legi&s;lative Body provide a Sect of good Laws, enforcing the Ob&s;ervation of the Divine; there the wanton Boughs and rampant Branches may be cut off, tho' the Trunk of the Tree remain, and the Root live. For, pub|lic Sins are but overgrown Branches of the accur&s;ed Root of corrupt Na|ture, which &s;hoot out to more open View. And 'tis evident from known Facts, that the&s;e in general may be lop'd off by a vigorous and faithful
<PB N="7" REF="007583_0007_102D7F45F1A3B7C8">
Exertion of civil Power and Authority. For the <HI>Magi&s;tracy</HI> was erected among Mankind in their degenerate State, and the&s;e Powers were ordain'd by God, for this very End. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.1. <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be, are ordain'd of God. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Or|dinance of God. For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to evil.</HI></P>
<P>It follows then, in An&s;wer to the la&s;t Inquiry, that this Work belongs to the Magi&s;trate; who, as by his Office, he undertakes it, &s;o he is obliged, in Point of Duty to God and the Public, to engage in it, otherwi&s;e <HI>be bears the Sword in vain.</HI> He ought to do all that in him lies to &s;uppre&s;s whatever Vice and Immortality is cognizable by the Law: This is greatly conducive to the Benefit of Society. <HI>For,</HI> continues the Apo&s;tle, 4 ver&punc; <HI>he is the Minister of God for Good to thee</HI> (if thou do that which is good) <HI>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain: For he is the Mini&s;ter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> The civil Magi&s;trate may do much toward a Reformation, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Vice, if he would dare to magnify his Office, by a vigilant and faithful Di&s;charge of it. When this is not wanting on his Part, all needed A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and a Ble&s;&s;ing, never &s;ail on God's Part. This might be exemplified by In&s;tances both from &s;acred and profane Hi&s;tory; but I &s;hall only recur to our Text and Context for Illu&s;tration. Here we find <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> as a <HI>Judge</HI> and <HI>Magi&s;trate,</HI> and as <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo</HI> of all the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Forces, expre&s;ly commanded by God to &s;earch out and puni&s;h <HI>the Accur&s;ed Thing</HI>: Which done, God went forth with their Armies and enabled them to &s;tand before their Enemies. This Event &s;eems in general to be adapted to all Per&s;ons in high Stations, and to have been de&s;igned for an Example to them. And that Nation that is favour'd with good Laws (&s;uch as &s;ecure the Per&s;ons, Privileges, and Properties of the Subject) and with faithful Magi&s;trates, of a generous public Spirit, may be &s;tyled <HI>Righteous,</HI> in a foren&s;ic Sen&s;e, agreeable to the Divine Aphori&s;m, <HI>Prov.</HI> 14.34. <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> encouraged, promoted, and protected, <HI>exalteth a Nation: But Sin,</HI> countenanced, and unpuni&s;hed by civil Authority, <HI>is a Reproach to any People.</HI></P>
<P>When therefore the Rulers of a profe&s;&s;ing People &s;end forth their Armies to war, they &s;hould not only be &s;atisfied that the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> be ju&s;t, but take a religious Care to remove every Thing, e&s;pecially the <HI>Accur&s;ed,</HI> from among them, that there may be no Ob&s;tacle in the Way of their Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007583_0008_102D7F47DE4753D8">Nor are <HI>Generals</HI> or <HI>Admirals,</HI> or any &s;ubordinate Officers, exempted from the Duty; but &s;hould do their Endeavour, as far as their Ob&s;ervation, Authority, and Influence, can extend, to put away Iniquity from among <HI>them&s;elves</HI> and their Men. And all that are in Authority, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, e&s;pecially <HI>the Preachers of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> ought daily, and forever to recommend and enforce the Ob&s;ervation of our &s;alutary Laws, by their <HI>own Example,</HI> and by a &s;teady, uniform Practice of tho&s;e Things, which they require by Law, and recommend by Precept and Doctrine: Otherwi&s;e the Law lo&s;es its Force, Government mi&s;&s;es its End, and Preach|ing is unprofitable. For the Glory of God, and the Good of the Public, require them to &s;hine as Lights in the Mid&s;t of a perver&s;e and crooked Generation.</P>
<P>In a Word; when the <HI>common Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Marines</HI> are engaged in War, they &s;hould carefully put away the unclean Thing; and &s;o &s;hould they that <HI>abide by the Stuff,</HI> and they that remain in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Hear with practical Reverence, what God &s;ays in this very Ca&s;e: <HI>Deut.</HI> 23.9. <HI>When the Ho&s;t goeth forth again&s;t thine Enemies, then keep thee from every wicked Thing. For the Lord thy God walketh in the Mid&s;t of thy Camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine Enemies before thee. Therefore &s;hall thy Camp be holy, that he &s;ee no unclean Thing in thee, and turn away from thee.</HI></P>
<P>Having di&s;patch'd the fir&s;t, we proceed to the next general Head.</P>
<P N="2">II. In order to the Removal of <HI>the accur&s;ed Thing,</HI> a diligent Inquiry ought to be made, to find out what it is.</P>
<P>Take away the Cau&s;e and the Effects will cea&s;e. In order to this, we mu&s;t u&s;e &s;uch Means as are adapted to the End.&mdash;We mu&s;t exerci&s;e our Faculties as rea&s;onable Creatures.&mdash;Mu&s;t con&s;ider our Ways, and ob&s;erve the Ways of others, e&s;timating the latter by Facts and clear Evidences, not by mere Su&s;picions.&mdash;We mu&s;t <HI>&s;earch and try our Ways</HI>; reflect upon our|&s;elves and Conduct; in&s;pect our Hearts very minutely; and examine our Actions very accurately, by the Divine Rule.&mdash;We mu&s;t learn the Art of <HI>Self-Knowledge</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See an excellent &s;mall Treati&s;e on this Subject by <HI>John Ma&s;on, A. M.</HI> which ought to be read by every one who is capable of <HI>Self-Application.</HI></NOTE>; which Kind of Knowledge is, in general, the lea&s;t re|garded and inquired after of many, tho' of all other the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful to Mankind, with Re&s;pect both to their pre&s;ent and future Happine&s;s. Every one ought to learn what are his own reigning Vices;
<PB N="9" REF="007583_0009_102D7F49B7A9C568">
and they that are in public Offices, ought to acquaint them&s;elves with the prevailing Vices of the Times, in order to expo&s;e and re&s;train them as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We need not enter into a Detail of Particulars, to inform tho&s;e that are in Office, what Method they ought to take, and what Means to u&s;e, in order to detect and re&s;train Vice and Immorality: If they know what belongs to their Office, they know the Means; and if &s;o, they are inex|cu&s;able, if they u&s;e them not, in the Sight of the Great LAW-GIVER and JUDGE of all, to whom they will one Day find them&s;elves ac|countable for all their Conduct and Procedure, both in the <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> and <HI>Executive</HI> Tru&s;t. To whom does it belong, but to the Magi&s;trate, to &s;earch out, and take away open and public Sins? Is he not &s;tyled in Scripture, <HI>The Mini&s;ter of God,</HI> for this End? <HI>Thus</HI> he is to &s;anctify the People;&mdash; and they al&s;o mu&s;t &s;anctify them&s;elves, <HI>by con&s;idering their Ways, and framing their Doings, to turn unto their God.</HI> In doing which, both Ma|gi&s;trates and People mu&s;t u&s;e the Means conducive to the End, or they will fail of the de&s;ired Succe&s;s. But, let it be noted, that the Sanctification here mentioned, is only legal and external, and will not avail to the Sal|vation of the Soul, without the internal Sanctification of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>We proceed to the next Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="3">III. To a&s;&s;ign the Rea&s;on of the Duty; which is, That unle&s;s God's People take away the accur&s;ed Thing from among them, they cannot &s;tand before their Enemies in Battle.</P>
<P>For the Evincing of this Point, let us con&s;ider the Nature of Sin in general; the defiling Influence of it upon Mankind; and the de&s;tructive Tendency and Con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>As to the Nature of Sin, it is de&s;cribed by an Apo&s;tle to be, <HI>The Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of the Law of God</HI>: Which Law is a Tran&s;cript of his moral Per|fections; therefore nece&s;&s;arily <HI>holy, ju&s;t, and good.</HI> The intrin&s;ic Turpitude of Sin, as contrary to the Purity of the Divine Nature and Law, is the prin|cipal Rea&s;on why it &s;hould be put away.</P>
<P>And it has a defiling Influence upon Men, and renders tho&s;e who are guilty of it, vile and filthy in the Sight of that God, <HI>who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity,</HI> without infinite Dete&s;tation, at any Time, or in any Place, e&s;pecially in a Time of War, and a critical Conjuncture of Affairs. Therefore it &s;hould be put away from the Courts and Palaces of Kings and Princes; from national Councils, and the higher Courts; and from all the
<PB N="10" REF="007583_0010_102D7F4B99D8BEB8">
Courts of Judicature in the Nation and Kingdom, of every Denomination; from the Markets, and all Places of public Commerce and Re&s;ort; and from our Camps, and Fleets, and Fortre&s;&s;es: For it is mo&s;t heinous, when practi&s;ed openly by Per&s;ons in high Stations, public Offices, and impor|tant Tru&s;ts, who &s;hould be the mo&s;t virtuous and exemplary Per&s;ons in the World, on Account of the Influence which their Example has upon others.</P>
<P>As to the Tendency and Con&s;equence of public Sins, it is to bring De|&s;olation and Ruin upon the People, as is evident from the Hi&s;tory of the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI>&mdash;For when the Holy ONE of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> looks down upon a People, and &s;ees the abominable Thing among them, he turns away with Indignation, and withdraws his favourable Pre&s;ence and kind Influence.&mdash; Then follows Confu&s;ion, and endle&s;s perplexing Debates in their Coun|cils, Fru&s;tration of their Schemes, Di&s;appointment of their Enterprizes, and Defeat of their Armies, with a <HI>Series</HI> of other Judgments and Cala|mities.</P>

<P N="1">1. Let us humble our&s;elves under the mighty Hand of God, that has been &s;tretch'd out again&s;t us, in the late Defeat of our principal Army.</P>
<P>This is a heavy Blow, ju&s;tly inflicted upon us by the Hand of an angry God&mdash;a terrible Evil in it&s;elf; but may however, by his wi&s;e and good Providence, prove beneficial in the End. And we <HI>ought</HI> to know that it is for our Sins, highly aggravated, long and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in, after &s;olemn Warnings, and &s;harp Rebukes, of various Kinds.

<P N="2">2. The next U&s;e &s;hall be of Information and Examination concerning the <HI>Accur&s;ed Thing,</HI> that has procur'd this Defeat.</P>
<P>That the World of Mankind is totally corrupt, I need not inform you:&mdash; But that Vice and Immorality, Error and Here&s;y, prevail more than ever, I mu&s;t tell you: Let the Reader's own <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> be my Witne&s;&s;es&mdash;<HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> that Candle of the Lord, that Lamp of Heaven, which lightens every Man that comes into the World; and which cannot be extigui&s;hed, till Man almo&s;t wholly degenerates from the State of his Creation.</P>

<P>And now, if there be one Sin rather than another, that may be pitch'd upon, as being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable procuring Cau&s;e of the late &s;ad Di&s;|a&s;ter, I take it to be <HI>Self-Confidence in War</HI>: This, added to all our other flagrant Crimes, and public Sins, &s;eems to have <HI>fill'd up</HI> our Mea&s;ure, and <HI>ripen'd</HI> us for the Melancholy Event.&mdash;Did not a Self-confident Spirit begin

to act, while we were preparing to &s;end out our Armies? Did it not run thro' the Country, like Wild-fire, all the Time the <HI>General</HI> was on his March to <HI>Ohio?</HI> Did it not enflame every Fancy, and catch from Heart to Heart, and kindle up &s;ome unhallow'd Sparks even in pious Brea&s;ts? Alas, that there was &s;o much of this accur&s;ed Thing to be &s;een, where better Things might have been expected!&mdash;Did we rightly con&s;ider <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> as the LORD of <HI>Sabaoth,</HI> or the Armies of his People?&mdash;That <HI>the Battle is his,</HI> and that he has an indubitable Right to <HI>give it to whom&s;oever he plea&s;eth?</HI> And to compleat the pre&s;umptuous Scene, did not our Troops go out to war, <HI>boa&s;ting</HI> in them&s;elves, as if they were not ju&s;t <HI>putting on the Harne&s;s,</HI> but were <HI>putting it off?</HI> And had we not &s;everal Accounts of the Prevalence of the &s;ame Spirit among them, while on their March? Does it not then appear, that <HI>Self-Confidence in War</HI> is the <HI>Accur&s;ed Thing,</HI> that prevented their <HI>&s;tanding before their Enemies?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We hence learn, that Self-Confidence in War is, in its Nature, mo&s;t offen&s;ive to the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</P>
<P>This is a complicate Vice of the Mind, and of an Athei&s;tical Complexion: It militates audaciou&s;ly and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly again&s;t the Being and Attri|butes of God; particularly his <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> in &s;etting up finite Wi&s;dom again&s;t that which is infinite, which alone knows how to govern the World, and di&s;po&s;e of all Events, infinitely better than the be&s;t Politicians.&mdash; Again&s;t His <HI>Power,</HI> by boa&s;ting in their own Strength, forgetful of the ALMIGHTY; tru&s;ting in their Numbers, in their Military Skill and Fur|niture; in the Bravery of their Generals and Admirals, and of their Officers and Men (all which are at be&s;t but an Arm of Fle&s;h) whereby they do practically, and in a Sen&s;e, explicitly, deny the ALMIGHTY, and their ab&s;olute Dependence upon Him; as if they, thus equip'd by Human Art, had no Need of Him to <HI>teach their Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight; and to cover their Heads in the Day of Battle:</HI> Or to be their <HI>Sun, to en|lighten them in their Way, and their Shield to defend them in their Battles:</HI> And as tho' they had it in their Power, to command Succe&s;s and Victory by their own conquering Blows.&mdash;It is al&s;o an Impeachment of the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of God, if he &s;hould not give them the Victory; allowing they are de|pendent on Him therefor.&mdash;And, in a Word, it is a &s;etting up their Wills again&s;t the Divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> and denying Him the &s;ole Prerogative of ordering all Events, as he plea&s;eth; particularly tho&s;e relating to guilty Mortals, unworthy of any gracious Notice. It is a determining in them|&s;elves,
<PB N="14" REF="007583_0014_102D7F52F46EC290">
and proudly declaring, That they <HI>will</HI> have the Victory, whether <HI>He</HI> will give it, or not: And &s;o by Con&s;equence, &s;etting up them&s;elves, not only again&s;t God, but above God.</P>
<P><HI>This,</HI> as it is the mo&s;t &s;hocking Thought, &s;o it is the mo&s;t ready Way to procure &s;uch a <HI>remarkable Defeat,</HI> as our Army has lately had.&mdash;Thus I have given you a general View of the Nature of Self-Confidence in War, <HI>the Accur&s;ed Thing,</HI> which, <HI>above all other,</HI> or in <HI>Addition to many other,</HI> public Sins, has provoked God to inflict this humbling Stroke.&mdash;Let as many of us then, as are con&s;cious of <HI>this Sin</HI> (and who among us is not guilty?) &s;mite upon our Brea&s;ts, &s;aying,&mdash;"Alas, my Soul, how great a Share ha&s;t thou had in procuring this Calamity!"</P>
<P N="4">4. We infer likewi&s;e, that it becomes us to be mode&s;t and cautious in our Remarks upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>People are very apt to make un&s;uitable Remarks upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions.&mdash; While &s;ome find Fault with the Great FIRST CAUSE, and blame the Conduct of his Providence;&mdash;others lay the Blame of adver&s;e Events upon <HI>Second Cau&s;es,</HI> in &s;uch a Manner, as if there was no <HI>Fir&s;t Mover,</HI> and <HI>Sovereign Di&s;po&s;er</HI> of Events; but as tho' all depended upon human Fore&s;ight, Prudence, and Bravery.</P>
<P>As to the Conduct of Divine Providence towards us, and the Equity of it, in the late Defeat, it has been &s;ufficiently vindicated in the preceding Di&s;cour&s;e, by the Con&s;ideration of our <HI>Sinfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Unworthine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>General,</HI> he was a brave experienc'd Warrior, in the <HI>Regular Way,</HI> who had, by his good Behaviour in Military Affairs, de&s;erved well of his King and Country;&mdash;and was in high Favour with tho&s;e who knew his Abilities:&mdash;His Merit recommended him to his Maje&s;ty's Service in <HI>America.</HI>&mdash;But he had not Opportunity to acquaint him&s;elf with the <HI>Irregu|lar Manner</HI> of Fighting in this Country&mdash;And &s;o he happen'd to be un|fortunate.&mdash;</P>
<P>When he fell into Difficulty and Danger, he exerted him&s;elf to the ut|mo&s;t;&mdash;and when the Ca&s;e requir'd it, expo&s;ed him&s;elf as much as if he had been a common Soldier, rather than de&s;ert our Cau&s;e, or &s;ave him&s;elf by an inglorious Flight.&mdash;And his Example was follow'd by the Officers, who, 'tis &s;aid, behav'd in the mo&s;t gallant Manner; tho' they al&s;o were unacquainted with the <HI>American</HI> Way of Fighting.</P>
<P>The Means of this Defeat were ordain'd and order'd by God: The procuring Cau&s;e was our Sins, e&s;pecially the <HI>Accur&s;ed Thing.</HI> We, by our
<PB N="15" REF="007583_0015_102D7F55559D3FB8">
Sins, by our <HI>Self-Confidence,</HI> together with <HI>that</HI> which prevail'd in the Army, rendered him unable to &s;tand before our Enemies.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>

And you mu&s;t be continually upon your Guard, <HI>watching again&s;t their Devices,</HI> that you may never be &s;urprized; but always ready to <HI>with&s;tand their Wiles,</HI> by the Force of <HI>constant Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>And now you mu&s;t <HI>stand strong,</HI> fight couragiou&s;ly in the &s;piritual War|fare, and &s;hew your&s;elves valiant Soldiers of the Captain of Salvation. And you may be a&s;&s;ur'd, that as it is the Son of God, who is &s;tyl'd <HI>the Captain of the Lord's Hosts,</HI> that leads you out into the Field of Battle; &s;o, he will be your CHAMPION, to bring you off <HI>more than Conquerors,</HI> at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Having therefore inli&s;ted <HI>under</HI> Him, you &s;hould encourage your&s;elves <HI>in</HI> Him, upon <HI>every Appearance of Danger</HI>;&mdash;and be <HI>&s;trong</HI> upon all <HI>Occa|&s;ions.</HI>&mdash;Let not your <HI>Graces</HI> be like the <HI>Soldiers</HI> of <HI>Saul,</HI> who <HI>&s;tood</HI> with him trembling, but like the <HI>Worthies</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> able to <HI>break thro'</HI> an Ho&s;t of Enemies, and draw Water at the Wells of Salvation.&mdash;And if at any Time you &s;hould be wounded and &s;oiled, <HI>look</HI> to your <HI>Leader,</HI> and he will <HI>heal</HI> you, and <HI>rai&s;e</HI> you up; for he is <HI>all-&s;ufficient.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>be then faithful to the Death</HI> (for thou mu&s;t <HI>once</HI> pa&s;s through <HI>that gloomy Vale,</HI> either in a natural or violent Way, to the bright triumphant World above) and then, tho' thou wa&s;t ranked among the meane&s;t of his Followers here, thou &s;halt be array'd and adorn'd with a Palm of final Victory, a Diadem of immaculate Beauty, and a Crown of immortal Glory; and &s;halt live and reign with Him in His Kingdom; where there is no Noi&s;e nor Rumour of War, but <HI>all the Region is everla&s;ting Peace.</HI>&mdash; Where &s;its the PRINCE of Peace, in <HI>State</HI> of Glory, on his Throne, in the Mid&s;t of <HI>Myriads</HI> of ble&s;&s;ed Spirits; the <HI>Delight</HI> of every Eye, the <HI>Joy</HI> of every Heart, the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> Re&s;t and Satisfaction of every happy Soul. To whom be GLORY, DOMINION, and POWER forever. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
