A <HI>Vapour</HI> is of but <HI>&s;hort</HI> Continuance.

they look back to find, how in&s;en&s;ibly their <HI>Days</HI> are rolled away.

And generally &s;peaking, the longer Per&s;ons live, the <HI>&s;horter</HI> their <HI>pa&s;t</HI> Days and Years &s;eem to them: And when they are in a &s;erious turn of Tho't, they more thoroughly realize, what a <HI>&s;mall</HI> part of <HI>Duration,</HI> the <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Humane Life</HI> contains.</P>

And yet, how many of our <HI>Ages</HI> go to make up a <HI>Thou&s;and</HI> Years! and yet further, how <HI>few</HI> live to what we call the <HI>full Age</HI> of a Man! Perhaps the greate&s;t part of <HI>Mankind</HI> die within the <HI>Space</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t Seven Years.</HI> And were one arrives at

the general <HI>Period</HI> affix'd to <HI>Humane Life,</HI> a <HI>thou&s;and</HI> die in <HI>Youth</HI> or <HI>Middle age.</HI> Such a Ju&s;tne&s;s and Propriety is there in the&s;e <HI>Scrip|ture</HI> Repre&s;entations of <HI>Man's Life</HI>: like a <HI>Vapour, it appears</HI> but <HI>for a little time, and then vani&s;hes away.</HI></P>
<P>If any &s;hou'd now feel them&s;elves <HI>unea&s;ie</HI> at this Repre&s;entation of <HI>Life,</HI> and be tempted to think <HI>hardly</HI> of GOD, for making the <HI>Limits</HI> of it &s;o exceeding <HI>narrow</HI>; it will at once &s;a|tisfy all their <HI>Objections,</HI> to con&s;ider <HI>Life</HI> in the true and proper <HI>Notion</HI> of it: <HI>as a Pro|bation &s;ea&s;on for Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>The GOD that gave us our <HI>Beings,</HI> de&s;ign'd them for an <HI>End</HI> worthy of Him&s;elf, and tho&s;e noble <HI>Powers, He</HI> has endow'd us with.

There is nothing <HI>here,</HI> that can &s;atisfy the <HI>De&s;ires</HI> of our Souls, or be a commen&s;urate <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> for them. We mu&s;t look beyond the <HI>Grave</HI> for this, to the un&s;een unutterable Glories of the <HI>Heavenly</HI> State. And if we take a View of the <HI>pre&s;ent Life,</HI> as referring to <HI>this State,</HI> and a <HI>Tryal</HI> for our Entrance into it, it will &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify, both the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of GOD in the <HI>Shortne&s;s</HI> of it.</P>
<P>E&s;pecially, if we go on and con&s;ider, that the Time of <HI>Life</HI> is a <HI>Space</HI> full <HI>long</HI> enough for the <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> we were &s;ent into the World up|on; <HI>viz.</HI> to make <HI>Preparation</HI> for <HI>Eternity.</HI> For thro' the LORD JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who</HI> has obey'd the <HI>Law,</HI> and &s;uffer'd the <HI>Penalty</HI>

of it, for <HI>us</HI> and in <HI>our</HI> &s;tead; the <HI>Terms</HI> of Sal|vation are bro't down to our pre&s;ent <HI>fallen</HI> State: and nothing more is <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> requir'd of us, but FAITH in JESUS CHRIST, as the SON of the <HI>living</HI> GOD, including in it the <HI>Seeds</HI> &amp; <HI>Principles</HI> of &s;incere <HI>Repentance,</HI> and a true <HI>Go&s;pel Obedience.</HI> And no &s;ooner is &s;uch a <HI>Faith</HI> wrought in our Souls, but our <HI>main Work</HI> is done, and the <HI>great De&s;ign</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> an&s;wered. And Per&s;ons not only may, but often are, even in the <HI>beginning</HI> of Life, thus endow'd with <HI>Faith.</HI> And a <HI>little</HI> Time, if it be well improv'd, in the diligent U&s;e of proper Means, will &s;erve for this purpo&s;e. And <HI>all</HI> that is <HI>afterwards</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, will be <HI>only</HI> to give proof of our good E&s;tate, to <HI>continue</HI> in the <HI>Faith</HI> of CHRIST; to <HI>grow</HI> in <HI>Grace</HI>; to <HI>&s;hine</HI> in the World by our <HI>good Examples</HI>; and in a word, to <HI>glorify</HI> GOD by our holy <HI>Carriage</HI> of our &s;elves under whatever Conditi|on He &s;hall plea&s;e to order out unto us. And when our Lives come to be thus employ'd, the <HI>&s;horter</HI> they are the <HI>better</HI>; ina&s;much as we &s;hall hereby the &s;ooner obtain <HI>the End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</HI> And this is the Tho't of all that are truly wi&s;e. They would not willingly have the Term of Life &s;et at a <HI>further</HI> Di&s;tance, lea&s;t the Tryal of their Graces &s;hould be <HI>too</HI> heavy and tedious; and the <HI>full</HI> Reward of their Faith and Good works <HI>too</HI> long detain'd from them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003402_0012_100314C81464A460">And on the other hand, when Per&s;ons do pervert the grand De&s;ign of Life; neglecting their Souls, and taking no Care to prepare them|&s;elves for the future State; 'tis unrea&s;onable to expect their Lives &s;hould be protracted, beyond what the Lives of Men ordinarily are, that &s;o they might have a <HI>longer</HI> Space of Tryal, before their Condition is unalterably determined. For if they &s;hould live over the pre&s;ent Life, as bounded by GOD, tho'tle&s;s of Eternity, and unconcerned to make Preparation for it; and in&s;tead hereof, &s;hould &s;pend their Days in Vanity, or the Gratification of their Fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, there would be but little Hope of their Amend|ment and returning to a better Mind, if their Time &s;hould be lengthned out to the <HI>longe&s;t</HI> Period: But on the contrary, great rea&s;on to fear, that they would only grow more bold and ob&s;tinate in Wickedne&s;s, and get &s;till at a fur|ther Di&s;tance from GOD and Happine&s;s. Be|&s;ides, the <HI>ordinary</HI> Duration of Man's Life, is full long enough for &s;uch Per&s;ons to be continu|ed <HI>Plagues</HI> to Mankind, by their evil Practices and bad Examples.

Pains are &s;o extream, or their Bodies &s;o very weak and faint, as to incapacitate them for the Work of getting ready to go out of the World. And O! how many, when upon a Death-bed, have, with Tears in their Eyes, mo&s;t bitterly lamented their Folly, in deferring to make their Peace with GOD till then; they have <HI>now</HI> found &s;o many Difficulties &amp; Inconveniencies in the way, beyond what they would have done, if they had engaged in this Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ooner, and in a more proper Time of Life.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there is nothing more precari|ous than a <HI>Death-bed</HI> Preparation for another World.

with Horrour at the Pro&s;pect, of what is like to be the Con&s;equence of their evil doings. Many while under Apprehen&s;ions of Death approach|ing, have been as much terrify'd and as heartily troubled; and have made as fair pretences &amp; as &s;olemn Promi&s;es: and yet, when GOD has ran|&s;om'd their Lives from De&s;truction, they have forgot the Angui&s;h of Spirit they were in, and returned to their former Folly &amp; Wickedne&s;s: Yea, they have made them&s;elves &s;even-fold more the Children of the Devil: whereby they have evidently di&s;covered it to the World, that their Repentance was not &s;incere; and that if they had died, they would have peri&s;h'd forever. And no doubt, this is the Ca&s;e of many, who&s;e Lives were not &s;pared to them. If they had been rai&s;ed up again, their Repentance would have prov'd it &s;elf to have been, nothing more than the Terrours of a guilty Con&s;cience. In a word, tis a Matter of the greate&s;t Nicene&s;s and Difficulty, to determine concerning any <HI>Death-bed</HI> Repentance in <HI>particular,</HI> whether it be &s;incere and &s;uch as GOD will accept: And after all that can be &s;aid, it mu&s;t &amp; will remain very precarious and uncertain.</P>
<P>Moreover, when we come to lie upon a Sick bed, we &s;han't find the Bu&s;ine&s;s of getting ready for Death and Judgment &s;uch an ea&s;ie thing, as at pre&s;ent we may imagine it to be.

<P>In a Word, She was an <HI>Honour</HI> to her <HI>Sex,</HI> in her exemplary Deportment under all the various Characters &amp; Relations of Life: As a Neighbour, Kind &amp; Piti&s;ul: As a Friend, true &amp; hearty;
<PB N="36" REF="003402_0040_1003152D01749EA0">
without Di&s;gui&s;e &amp; abhorrent to Flattery and Deceit: As a Wife, tender &amp; dutiful; engaging in her Carriage; reverent &amp; re&s;pectful: As Mi&s;tre&s;s in a Family, di&s;creet in her Management; a Lover of good Order; neat &amp; cleanly; tho'tful of all under her Care; indulgent &amp; compa&s;&s;ionate to her Servants: e&s;pecially concern'd about their Souls, and frequent in teaching them the good Knowledge of the LORD; in her Treatment of Strangers, ho&s;pitable; courteous, plea&s;ant, ob|liging &amp; edifying to tho&s;e that came to vi&s;it her.</P>
<P>But her <HI>chief</HI> Excellency, &amp; what <HI>mo&s;t</HI> recom|mended to all that knew her, was her <HI>undi&s;sembled</HI> Piety. She had an habitual prevailing Awe and Reverence of GOD upon her Heart: which <HI>early</HI> di&s;covered it &s;elf, and <HI>all along</HI> thro' the Cour&s;e of her Life, not only in an utter Abhorrence of every thing that &s;avour'd of Prophanne&s;s &amp; Irre|verence; but in a due Treatment of tho&s;e things, wherein the <HI>Divine Honour</HI> is nearly concern'd. She lov'd the Hou&s;e, &amp; Sanctify'd the Day of God; gave her con&s;tant devout Attendance on the Pub|lick Wor&s;hip, and <HI>all</HI> Go&s;pel Ordinances; paid a &s;ingular Regard to the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI>; valued the Mini&s;ters of Religion; and had an univer&s;al Regard to all good Men. But above all, CHRIST was the <HI>Object</HI> of her Love, her Faith, her Hope. It was in her Account <HI>a faithful &s;aying,</HI> and &s;he e&s;teem'd it <HI>worthy of all Acceptation, that</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>was come into the World to &s;ave Sinners.</HI> HIM therefore &s;he embrac'd as the <HI>alone</HI> REDEEMER of Souls; HIM &s;he

tru&s;ted with the great Affair of her Eternal Sal|vation; HIM &s;he lov'd with her whole Heart; HIM &s;he made it her Care to plea&s;e in all things; HIS Image &s;he was Adorn'd with; &amp; the Graces of HIS SPIRIT &s;he liv'd in the daily Exerci&s;e of: And we charitably believe &s;he is gone to be with CHRIST, which is be&s;t of all.</P>
<P>I doubt not, but the Mourning Friends &amp; Re|latives have often refre&s;h'd their Souls, by look|ing back to her pa&s;t Conver&s;ation in CHRIST; and then by turning theiy View forward to tho&s;e unutterable Glories, &s;he is now po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, in the Place GOD has ordain'd for the <HI>Spirits</HI> of Believers, in their <HI>&s;eparate State.</HI> And while by <HI>Faith,</HI> they are beholding her, as in the Bo&s;ome of JESUS, I may well &s;uppo&s;e, they grieve not for <HI>her</HI>; but rather rejoyce, that &s;he is got beyond the Reach of Sorrow, the Power of Temptation and the Po&s;&s;ibility of Sinning; and that &s;he is entred upon the Reward of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is <HI>Joy</HI> &amp; <HI>Peace, Quietne&s;s &amp; A&s;&s;urance for ever</HI>:, Yet upon their <HI>own</HI> Accounts, they may have Rea&s;on to Mourn, and &s;tand in need of Con&s;o|lation.</P>
<P>We heartily wi&s;h, for all the Relatives, Divine Support under this <HI>Tryal of their Faith</HI>; the comforting Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Holy</HI> GHOST; and the &s;anctifying Influences of &s;upernatural Grace, whereby they may be enabled &s;o to behave them&s;elves, as that GOD may be honour'd their own Holine&s;s increa&s;ed and their future &amp; <HI>eter|nal Weight of Glory</HI> inhanced.</P>

<HEAD>An <HI>APPENDIX.</HI> From the <HI>Weekly News-Letter,</HI> No. 1405. Containing an Account of the Decea&s;ed. <HI>BOSTON, December</HI> 29. 1730.</HEAD>
<P>YE&s;terday were Buried here the Remains of that truly honourable &amp; devout Gentlewoman, Mrs. SARAH BYFIELD, amid&s;t the affectionate Re&s;pects and La|mentations of a numerous Concour&s;e. &mdash; Before carrying out the Corp&s;e a Funeral Prayer was made, by One of the Pa&s;tors of the <HI>Old Church,</HI> to who&s;e Communion &s;he be|long'd: Which, tho' a Cu&s;tom in the Country-Towns, is a &s;ingular In&s;tance in this place, but it's wi&s;h'd may prove a leading Example to the general Practice of &s;o chri&s;tian &amp; decent a Cu&s;tom.&mdash; The Pall was held up by the honourable the late Lieut. Gov. DUMMER, with other Gentlemen of His Maje&s;ty's Council. Among the mourning Relatives went his Excellency Governour BELCHER, and his Honour Lieut. Gov. TAILER: fol|low'd by a long Train of Per&s;ons of publick Di&s;tinction and private Character; paying their la&s;t Offices to the Dead, and uniting their &s;incere Condolences with the Living.</P>
<P>This Gentlewoman was di&s;tingui&s;h'd by her Birth and Family; being younge&s;t Daughter to the late excellent Gov. LEVERETT, who&s;e Name is &s;till had in Honour a|mong us, and will be always venerable to tho&s;e that know the Story of <HI>New-England.</HI>&mdash; She was honourable al&s;o
<PB N="41" REF="003402_0045_1003153E1755E080">
by her Marriage; being Con&s;ort to the worthy aged <HI>Nathanael Byfield,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;ometimes Senior Coun&s;eller for this Province, and now Judge of the Vice-Admiralty; to whom &s;he was marry'd <HI>April</HI> 17. 1718. The Com|panion of his advanced Years, the dear Partner of his Griefs and Joys, and very much his Delight and Ornament.</P>
<P>But She was mo&s;t of all di&s;tingui&s;h'd by her per&s;onal Merits; which tho&s;e have a &s;ingular Sen&s;e of, that were mo&s;t intimately acquainted with her: and this is one of the &s;ure&s;t Te&s;ts of true Worth. She inherited much of the excellent Spirit &amp; Principles, which embalm the Memory of her incomparable Father &amp; Mother, who were &s;ome of the faire&s;t Ornaments of their Age. She had a con&s;picuous Share of that good Sen&s;e, &s;o natural to the Family, and was much improv'd in the mo&s;t u&s;eful Knowledge. In Conjunction with a &s;prightly Wit, She had a thoughtful Genius; and her fervent Temper was govern'd &amp; adorn'd by a rare Di&s;cretion: which peculiarly accompli&s;h'd her to &s;hine in that &s;uperiour Rank where Divine Providence placed her. She honoured the &s;everal States of Virginity and Marriage; and fill'd up the various Characters and Relations &s;he &s;u&s;tain'd, with the Duties belonging to them. While &s;he affected not Appearances, but declined Show and Noi&s;e, a primitive Simplicity, Humility &amp; Mode&s;ty reflected a Lu&s;tre on all her other Graces &amp; Accompli&s;h|ments: and &s;he &s;hone with Eminence in the &s;everal Vir|tues of the Dome&s;tick Life, the proper Di&s;tinctions of her Sex. And here the Prudence of her Oeconomy, joyn'd with a ho&s;pitable Management, her Civility &amp; Courteou&s;|ne&s;s to Vi&s;itants, her grave &amp; chearful Conver&s;ation, her reverent &amp; engaging Carriage to her honourable Con&s;ort, and wi&s;e Deportment among his Children; the&s;e things have merited for her the Privilege &amp; Honour of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s vertuous Woman: <HI>Her Children ari&s;e up and call her Ble&s;&s;ed; her Husband al&s;o, and he prai&s;eth her.</HI></P>
<P>But above all her Memory is re&s;pected for that &s;erious Piety, and Spirit of Devotion, which brighten'd her early Years, and continued with her to the End. She was fa|vour'd with a religious as well as ingenuous Education;
<PB N="42" REF="003402_0046_1003153F99EB8368">
and agreably (in Addition to the Gentlewoman) &s;he had much of <HI>the Chri&s;tian,</HI> which is a Di&s;tinction that will la&s;t, when all others are bury'd in Silence. She was a lover of &s;acred Retirements; liv'd upon her Bible, and gave her &s;elf to Prayer. An equal Friend &s;he was to Fa|mily-Devotions: and the publick A&s;&s;emblies cou'd wit|ne&s;s her diligent Attendance on all publick Ordinances. She was a &s;trict Ob&s;erver of the LORD's DAY, and took Care to &s;anctify the Sabbath in her Conduct at home, as well as at the Hou&s;e of GOD. She took a great deal of commendable Pains in Catechi&s;ing &amp; in&s;tructing the Ser|vants committed to her Charge: Opening her Mouth with Wi&s;dom, and in her Tongue was the Law of Kind|ne&s;s. In her you might &s;ee the conde&s;cending &amp; faithful Mi&s;tre&s;s, the affectionate Mother, the vertuous &amp; prudent Wife, the con&s;tant Friend, and the obliging Neighbour. And &s;urely the World will not envy the&s;e ju&s;t Honours to the Memory of &s;o valuable a Per&s;on.</P>
<P>She was born <HI>July</HI> 13. 1673. &mdash; and died after a &s;hort Illne&s;s, <HI>Dec.</HI> 21. 1730. Leaving behind her that <HI>good Name, which is better than precious Ointment, and the day of Death was better</HI> to her (we tru&s;t) <HI>than the day of her Birth.</HI> &mdash; May we all be found Followers of them who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promi&s;es.</P>
