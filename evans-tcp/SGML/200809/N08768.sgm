<P>_THERE is no way in which what is amiable can be better recom|mended, than by holding up to view &s;ome eminent and unexcep|tionable example in it's kind. We are formed for imitation, and find within our&s;elves an aptitude to re&s;emble tho&s;e we live among, and are conver&s;ant with. While our propen&s;ities are on the &s;ide of vice, as they will be until they are rectified by divine grace, we &s;hall be more inclined to copy after a vicious, than a virtuous character; but this notwith&s;tanding, few are corrupt to &s;o great a degree as to be incapable of perceiving the beauty of virtue, or of being put upon endeavours to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; e&s;pe|cially when &s;et in an agreable light by the lu&s;tre of &s;ome excelling example.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011206_0004_0F862C30C0A033B8">Hence it is that the &s;acred penmen have taken care to exhibit to public view the character of one and another, under the &s;everal di&s;pen&s;ations of the kingdom of God's grace, who were eminently holy in their day; &s;trongly recommending to univer&s;al ob&s;ervation the&s;e patterns of virtue, that &s;uch as are acquainted with them may be influenced to copy after them, to the honor of God, and the &s;ecurity of their own eternal well-being.</P>
<P>My text pre&s;ents to the chri&s;tian Jews &s;uch ex|amples of faith and patience, as they had been fa|voured with; and exhorts to an imitation of them: E&s;pecially, as it was through the&s;e graces, that they went to the enjoyment of the promi&s;ed heavenly inheritance. "Be ye followers of them, who, through faith and patience, inherit the pro|mi&s;es". In which words three particulars are con|tained, which it may not be unprofitable, or un&s;ea|&s;onable, to &s;pend a few thoughts upon.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. An intimation of the happine&s;s of departed &s;aints.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The de&s;cribed and &s;pecified way, through which they came to this happine&s;s. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. A recommendation of their example to our &s;pecial notice.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t thing ob&s;ervable in the text is, an intimation of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of departed &s;aints. It is &s;aid of them, they "inherit the promi&s;es"; that is, the happine&s;s "promi&s;ed" to be enjoyed in the future world. And what de&s;erves a particular remark, they are &s;poken of as NOW in the enjoy|ment
<PB N="7" REF="011206_0005_0F862C3172CAE630">
of this happine&s;s. "Who inherit the pro|mi&s;es". The words are a periphra&s;is, expre&s;&s;ive of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s they are actually the &s;ubjects of in their <HI>unbodied</HI> &s;tate. Not that the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men are in a &s;tate of compleat happine&s;s. This will not commence, until the great day of judg|ment is over, when they &s;hall a&s;cend, in body as well as &s;oul, with their Redeemer, to the heavenly world, and be fixed in tho&s;e "man&s;ions" of ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s he is "gone before to prepare for them". But previous to this, and in&s;tantly upon their death, they will enter upon a &s;tate of happine&s;s; a &s;tate &s;uted to them as naked &s;pirits; a &s;tate wherein they &s;hall be perfectly freed from all &s;in, tempta|tion, and &s;orrow; and in which they &s;hall enjoy the ble&s;&s;ed God, far beyond what they ever did, or could do, while here on earth.</P>
<P>This truth, however uncertain from the deducti|ons of meer rea&s;on, &s;eems plainly evident from what is &s;aid upon it in the revealed word of God. It does not indeed, in a formal manner, &s;peak of the &s;pirits of good chri&s;tians in their &s;eparate &s;tate, particularly de&s;cribing their happine&s;s there; but it &s;ays that concerning them, in &s;o many places, and in language &s;o po&s;itively clear and expre&s;s, as to leave it beyond all rea&s;onable doubt, that they &s;till live, and that they live happy.</P>
<P>In the parable, recorded in the 16th chapter of Luke, Lazarus is &s;poken of as received, immedi|ately at his death, to joy in the invi&s;ible world. So the account is, ver. 22. "And it came o pa&s;s, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bo&s;om". And, in the 25th ver. it is
<PB N="8" REF="011206_0006_0F862C31AB92B578">
&s;aid, though he had here received "evil things", yet that he was "now comforted". What can the&s;e words intend, if his &s;pirit was not in the en|joyment of happine&s;s? This &s;eems to be one of the main thoughts, our Lord had in view to convey to us.</P>
<P>Very pertinent al&s;o to our purpo&s;e are tho&s;e words of our Savior, Luke 23.43. "Verily, I &s;ay unto thee, TO DAY &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e". They contain a promi&s;e to a poor dy|ing malefactor, which would have no meaning, if it did not a&s;&s;ure him, that, in&s;tantly upon his death, he &s;hould be admitted to a place of happine&s;s; for that is the &s;cripture idea of the word, "paradi&s;e". And what our Lord here promi&s;ed to this thief, he promi&s;es al&s;o to all, who like him, are &s;incerely penitent. They al&s;o &s;hall "be with him in para|di&s;e", upon their leaving this world. The day of their death will be to them a day of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>I may al&s;o bring to view tho&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle, Philip. 1.21. "For me to live is Chri&s;t, and to die is gain". But how could death have been "gain" to him, if he did not thereupon enter into a world in which he &s;hould be happy? He adds, in the 23d ver. "for I am in a &s;trait betwixt two, having a de&s;ire to depart, and to be with Chri&s;t, which is far better". He here &s;peaks of his "departure by death", as his "going to be with Chri&s;t", and &s;o as that it would be "far bet|ter" for him, than to "abide in the fle&s;h". But could there be a po&s;&s;ibility of this, unle&s;s it be &s;up|po&s;ed, that there is a happy &s;tate, in which his &s;oul would exi&s;t, after it's &s;eparation from his body?
<PB N="9" REF="011206_0007_0F862C328DBC1530">
And why &s;hould he be "in a &s;trait", not knowing whether it was his "de&s;ire to depart, or abide" here, if his departure would not have placed him, as to his &s;pirit, in a better &s;tate than that he was in at pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add one text more, which de&s;erves a more than ordinary notice; as it is introduced with all imaginable &s;olemnity, as it were on pur|po&s;e, to engage our attention. It is thus recorded, Rev. 14.13. "And I heard a voice from heaven, &s;aying unto me; write, ble&s;&s;ed are the dead, which die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, faith the &s;pirit, that they may re&s;t from their labors, and their works do follow them". It is ob&s;ervable, they are dead &s;aints that are the &s;ubjects of this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; they are "from henceforth", from the day of their death, made thus ble&s;&s;ed; and the &s;pecial rea&s;on why they are thus ble&s;&s;ed, is &s;ignified by no le&s;s a per&s;on than the Spirit of God. "Yea, &s;aith the &s;pirit", for that "they re&s;t from their la|bors, and their works do follow them", that is, the reward of their works; which would be impo&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s, at death, they went into a &s;tate, in which they were favored with the enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ed God, the &s;upreme good?</P>
<P>How &s;hould this truth, we have been illu&s;trating, &s;upport and comfort &s;uch as have been bereaved of relatives, friends, or acquaintance, who were, in the eye of hope, the true di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. You have no rea&s;on to mourn on their account. For, though their bodies may be laid in the dark and &s;ilent grave, they are &s;till alive in regard of their &s;ouls, and incomparably more happy than
<PB N="10" REF="011206_0008_0F862C3328C3E5D8">
they could have been, had they &s;till continued here. Should not the tho't of this, compo&s;e your minds to &s;ilence, however de&s;irable tho&s;e taken from you may have been, however bright their virtues, how|ever amiable their conver&s;ation in the world? The higher they had attained in grace here, the greater is their reward in the &s;tate beyond the grave.&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, &s;uch as are the faithful &s;ervants of God, have abundant rea&s;on to be perfectly re|conciled to the thought of dying them&s;elves. If, at death, the &s;oul as well as body lay down &s;en&s;e|le&s;s and inactive, it would be no wonder, if, when they turned their view to the grave, &s;huddering horror was excited in their brea&s;ts; though they knew, that, at the general re&s;urrection, they &s;hould be again brought to life to be made happy forever. Death would appear, to the good man, in a me|lancholy gloomy form, if it &s;tripped him of all &s;en&s;e and life in &s;oul, as well as body; and he might well be aver&s;e to pa&s;s through &s;o dull an e|vent. But the truth is, his better and &s;uperior part, the &s;pirit God has formed within him, liveth, and abideth forever. His &s;oul does not, like his body, lie down &s;tupid; but is "carried, by the angels of God, to Abraham's bo&s;om", where it ex|i&s;ts happy in the enjoyment of that good, which is laid up in the divine promi&s;es. And, as this is the re&s;ult of death to the true believer in Je&s;us, why &s;hould he be afraid to die? He &s;hould rather "de|&s;ire to depart, that he may be with Chri&s;t", where he will &s;in no more, nor be any more &s;ubjected to the tryals, and &s;orrows, that are in&s;eperable from this pre&s;ent, frail, mortal &s;tate. &mdash;But I mu&s;t pro|ceed to the</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="011206_0009_0F862C33E3E3AEE0">II. Second thing contained in my next, which is, the way through which the &s;aints come to "in|herit the promi&s;es"; namely, that of "faith and patience". This is the way marked out in the "Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God".</P>
<P>Without "faith", no chri&s;tian was ever yet &s;aved; nor will any one, in future time, be ad|mitted to the joy of his Lord. Our Savior, who &s;urely knew the way to heaven, has plainly de|clared, that it is through "faith" in him. You are all acquainted with the texts to this purpo&s;e. Only, it &s;hould ever be remembered, this faith is not an empty &s;peculation. It is not an inactive, dead faith; but a faith that "works by love", that "purifies the heart", and argues the &s;ubject of it to be one "born of God", and an "over|comer of the world". It is that faith, by which "the ju&s;t do live", and that is an abiding, habi|tual, powerful principle of all holy conformity to the will of God, both in heart and life, in a way of &s;uffering as well as doing.</P>
<P>And as it is "through faith", &s;o is it likewi&s;e "through patience", that the &s;aints "inherit the promi&s;es". Hence that exhortation of the Apo&s;tle, Heb. 12.1. "Let us run with patience the race &s;et before us". The way to the heavenly inheri|tance is rough. It is &s;trawed with difficulties of one kind, and another. And tho&s;e who would walk in this way, had need be armed with "pati|ence". They will often have occa&s;ion for the ex|erci&s;e of this grace; nor can they, unle&s;s they are, in a mea&s;ure, the &s;ubjects of it, ever make progre&s;s towards the heavenly &s;tate. None have ever gone
<PB N="12" REF="011206_0010_0F862C35CB513398">
to "inherit the promi&s;es", but through tryals, and &s;o many of them, as that, if they had not been en|dowed with "patience", they would have given out. This grace in them has been often called forth to exerci&s;e; and, in this way, they have at|tained to happine&s;s in the future &s;tate.</P>
<P>But it may more emphatically be &s;aid, with re|ference to &s;ome of the &s;aints, that, "through faith and patience", they are gone to "inherit the pro|mi&s;es".</P>
<P>It was in this way that many of the fir&s;t chri|&s;tians glorified God, and went to the enjoyment of him. The tryals and &s;ufferings they were called to endure for the name of Chri&s;t, were many, and grievou&s;ly heavy. They had "the tryal of cruel mockings and &s;courgings; yea, of bonds and im|pri&s;onment". They were "&s;awn a&s;under; and &s;lain with the &s;word". They were "de&s;titute, afflicted, and tormented". And, under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s, how did they rely on God! What full credit did they give to his word and promi&s;es! How chearfully did they re&s;ign up, even their very lives into his hands! And how exem|plary was their "patience"? They made no com|plaints again&s;t the conduct of heaven: They did not murmur, or repine; but bore all that was laid upon them, with compo&s;edne&s;s of mind. They were willing to &s;uffer in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t; and "counted not their lives dear to them, &s;o that they might fini&s;h their cour&s;e with joy".</P>
<P>And as it was with the fir&s;t chri&s;tians, &s;o it has been with many &s;ince, and with &s;ome even in the&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="011206_0011_0F862C371ACD09C8">
days; they went to the "inheritance" eminently "through faith and patience". God's hand was laid heavy upon them. Many, various, and &s;adly grievous were the tryals it plea&s;ed the alwi&s;e, and righteous Governor of the world to exerci&s;e them with. And, when di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide, how bright did the graces of "faith and patience" ap|pear in them! They "&s;et their hope in God".&mdash; They re&s;ted their &s;ouls on his promi&s;es.&mdash;And the more &s;harp and cutting their &s;orrows, the more firm was their faith in the revelations of God, the more vigorous the actings of it. And, in &s;tead of "re|&s;i&s;ting the will", or "di&s;puting the plea&s;ure" of the almighty, they ju&s;tified the wi&s;dom of his deal|ings with them, and "patiently" received correcti|on from the hand of their heavenly father. Their greate&s;t concern was, le&s;t they &s;hould reflect di&s;|honor on the name and religion of Chri&s;t, by a temper and behavior, unbecoming their character as his di&s;ciples; and, by the aids of divine grace, they were enabled to bear their tryals, however &s;e|vere, with meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, a calm, patient, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive frame of mind. And in this way it was, that they went to "inherit the promi&s;es".</P>
<P>We &s;hould herefrom learn to entertain ju&s;t &s;en|timents of the tryals good men are often called, in the providence of God, to conflict with. It is by the&s;e occa&s;ion is given, and opportunity offered, for tho&s;e di&s;coveries of faith, patience, and other chri|&s;tian graces, whereby God is, in a &s;ignal manner, glorified, and his tried &s;ervants prepared for more di&s;tingui&s;hed man&s;ions in the place of future ble&s;&s;|edne&s;s. Perhaps, there is no &s;uch &s;chool to train up, and perfect the chri&s;tian, as that of affliction.
<PB N="14" REF="011206_0012_0F862C37ABCCB908">
Tho&s;e who have been called to pa&s;s through the heavie&s;t, and mo&s;t numerous tryals, have, by their improvements under them, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted herein by the divine Spirit, been enabled to &s;hine with a peculiar lu&s;tre, to the honor of Chri&s;t; and their reward here|upon has been "great in heaven". Let not any e&s;teem good men unhappy, though they &s;hould be &s;orely afflicted: Neither &s;hould they think thus of them&s;elves. "If they &s;uffer with Chri&s;t", in the exerci&s;e of faith and patience, in imitation of him, they &s;hall be "glorified with him". And "what are the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent life", when "compared with the glory", which &s;hall, in the next &s;tate, be "revealed in tho&s;e who are the &s;ons of God"? They are not worthy to be mention|ed.&mdash;They are lighter than nothing. But I may not enlarge.</P>
<P N="3">III. The next thing ob&s;ervable in my next is, an exhortation to follow tho&s;e, who, "through faith and patience, inherit the promi&s;es".</P>
<P>We &s;hould be imitators of them in every thing, wherein they appeared amiable and lovely. Have we beheld, in departed &s;aints, any thing worthy of God, and of their character as the di&s;ciples of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t? We &s;hould not re&s;t &s;atisfied in having &s;een the&s;e things; but &s;hould carefully place their example before our view, and copy after it, wherein it was prai&s;e-worthy. It is a favor of God, to have had &s;uch patterns of virtue, and his expectation that we make a wi&s;e and good u&s;e of &s;uch an advantage: Nor can we, without &s;in, &s;uf|fer &s;uch examples to pa&s;s our notice; expre&s;&s;ing little or no care to be imitators of them. We &s;hould
<PB N="15" REF="011206_0013_0F862C387272B7F8">
employ our thoughts on the virtues and graces, &s;aints departed exhibited, in their lives, learn therefrom our own duty, and encourage our&s;elves heartily to engage in the practice of it. We &s;hould make u&s;e of their good examples, both as a <HI>copy,</HI> and a <HI>motive:</HI> Only keeping in mind this needful thought, that the be&s;t of men are but men, and to be imitated with &s;ub&s;erviency to the great rule of duty contained in the &s;acred books of &s;cripture. Their virtues, and not their frailties and imperfecti|ons, are to be remembered and followed by us. We &s;hould be "followers of them, wherein they followed Chri&s;t"; and no farther.</P>
<P>And we &s;hould endeavour an imitation of de|parted &s;aints, e&s;pecially in their "faith and pati|ence". The&s;e are amiable, as well as important graces; beautifying to the &s;ubjects of them, and nearly connected with their highe&s;t intere&s;t in the coming world. It will therefore conduce to our own honor, and be&s;t good, to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them; and that we may &s;o do, we cannot be too careful to copy after the pattern &s;et us by tho&s;e, who, as occa&s;ions were offered therefor in the con|duct of providence, have &s;ignali&s;ed them&s;elves for the exerci&s;e of the&s;e graces.</P>
<P>Have any, within the reach of our notice, been, in an uncommon degree, exemplary for the firm|ne&s;s, con&s;tancy, and vigor of their "faith" in the perfections, and revelations of God; ever repair|ing to him as the &s;upreme object of their tru&s;t, the ultimate refuge of their &s;ouls, in tho&s;e lively act|ings of "faith", which we could not but admire? We &s;hould not be forgetful ob&s;ervers of &s;uch di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
<PB N="16" REF="011206_0014_0F862C39508C57E8">
faith in God, and in his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but &s;hould keep it &s;teadily in our view, that we al&s;o, under the influence of heaven, may become eminent in&s;tances of "like precious faith".</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e, if we have had opportunity to be|hold the "patience" of tho&s;e, who&s;e lot it has been to pa&s;s through numerous difficulties, and &s;ore tryals; if we have &s;een them, under the heavie&s;t pre&s;&s;ures, calm, quiet, re&s;igned to God, and in a temper of mind, not to murmur and complain, but to acknowledge, and &s;ay, "I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that in faithful|ne&s;s thou ha&s;t afflicted me";&mdash;we &s;hould look up|on our&s;elves as in&s;tructed by God, and laid under obligations, &s;hould there be opportunity for it, to be like examples our&s;elves of this grace, which has been thus gloriou&s;ly di&s;played in the conduct of others.</P>
<P>One de&s;ign of God, in placing before our view the&s;e in&s;tances of "faith and patience" is, that we might learn our duty, and be animated with zeal and re&s;olution to put it in practice. It &s;hould be our earne&s;t endeavour to an&s;wer this intention of heaven; taking all due care, that &s;uch examples of God's grace may not, by our own non-improve|ment, or mi&s;-improvement, of them, ri&s;e up in judgment to our &s;hame and condemnation.</P>
<P>The reflections, upon what has been di&s;cour&s;ed, are as follow.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, while we admire and imitate what we have &s;een, that is amiable in departed good chri&s;tians, give God the glory of his grace be&s;tow|ed
<PB N="17" REF="011206_0015_0F862C3AD24B51B0">
on them. Whatever we may have &s;een in them, that was lovely and beautiful, they were be|holden to God for it. He it was that made them to differ. While therefore we take notice of what was virtuous and prai&s;e-worthy in them, we &s;hould remember to acknowledge God. We &s;hould look through them to him, and be di&s;po&s;ed to give him the honor of that grace which appeared in them.</P>
<P>We &s;hould al&s;o take occa&s;ion, from the good example of other, to humble our&s;elves wherein we have been unexemplary, and endeavour a reforma|tion. We cannot make a wi&s;er and better im|provement of the piety, the humility, the meek|ne&s;s, the faith, the patience, and other chri&s;tian graces, we may have &s;een manife&s;ted in the lives of tho&s;e we have been acquainted with, than by turning our view to our&s;elves, and enquiring, with a becoming &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, how we have had our con|ver&s;ation in the world. And wherein we are de&s;ti|tute of that, which we could not but approve as exemplarily excellent in tho&s;e that are gone before us, we &s;hould be aba&s;ed in a &s;en&s;e of our own neg|ligent carele&s;&s;ne&s;s; condemning our&s;elves, and re|&s;olving, in the &s;trength of God, that we will take better heed to our ways for the time to come. If we have been greatly deficient in any of tho&s;e vir|tues and graces, in which they &s;hined with peculiar brightne&s;s, we &s;hould look upon our&s;elves as ad|moni&s;hed and warned of God; and be in&s;tant, and arduous, in our endeavours to cau&s;e our light to &s;hine with the like lu&s;tre.&mdash;And if, in &s;tead of be|ing only defective in their graces, we are defiled with the contrary vices, we &s;hould &s;ee our&s;elves re|proached, and &s;olemnly called upon to repent and

reform. Can we think of that grace of God, which eminently appeared in this, or the other relative, or friend, or neighbour, or mini&s;ter, that is gone to "inherit the promi&s;es", and not feel the re&s;ent|ments of an accu&s;ing con&s;cience? We have cer|tainly awful rea&s;on to judge, and condemn our|&s;elves. May we receive reproof, learn our folly, be &s;truck with the beauties of holine&s;s in the&s;e pat|terns of it, and copy after them, &s;o as to exceed them in glory!</P>
<P>In fine, we are obviou&s;ly taught, from what has been di&s;cour&s;ed, our duty with re&s;pect to departed &s;aints. We &s;hould not pray for them, neither &s;hould we pray to them. Such prayers, however common in the Roman church, are both needle&s;s and &s;en&s;ele&s;s. But we &s;hould remember the grace of God, which appeared in their faith, and pati|ence, their holy, heavenly, and chri&s;tian behavior in life; and be excited herefrom to the grea|te&s;t diligence, in the u&s;e of all proper means, that we al&s;o may attain to a noble eminency in very thing that is virtuous.</P>
<P>This leads me to take &s;ome &s;pecial notice of the occa&s;ion which put me upon bringing you &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e at this time, the death of the Reverend Dr. SEWALL; who was ju&s;tly held in high reputation, throughout the town, and land, for tho&s;e excellent qualities, in which he &s;hone with exemplary brightne&s;s, both as a chri&s;tian, and a mini&s;ter, from a youth to protracted old age.</P>
<P>The father of Spirits was plea&s;ed to furni&s;h him with valuable intellectual powers. The&s;e, by the
<PB N="19" REF="011206_0017_0F862C3CDB482950">
advantage of a good education, were happily cul|tivated and improved; and, being &s;anctified by divine grace, were faithfully employed in promo|ting the intere&s;t of "pure and undefiled religion".</P>
<P>He was early devoted to the &s;ervice of the &s;anctu|ary by his father, that upright CHIEF JUSTICE, the honorable Judge SEWALL, who, for a long cour&s;e of years, was a member of this Church, and one of it's greate&s;t ornaments. And to this &s;er|vice, from inclination, he freely devoted him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was called by you of this Church to the work of the Go&s;pel-mini&s;try, the 25th of April, 1712; but he returned no an&s;wer to your call, until he had often a&s;ked direction of God; &s;etting apart &s;ome &s;pecial &s;ea&s;ons for this purpo&s;e by him&s;elf a|lone, and once at lea&s;t in union with his venerable, pious father, who was ever ready to the bu&s;ine&s;s of prayer, and took great delight in it.</P>
<P>He was publicly and &s;olemnly &s;eperated to the work, to which you had called him, "by fa&s;ting, and prayer, and laying on of the hands of the pre&s;by|tery", the 16th of September, 1713; from which time, he labored in the Go&s;pel-mini&s;try, among you, with as little intermi&s;&s;ion, by rea&s;on of tho&s;e infirmities to which we are all &s;ubject, as has been ordinarily known. Few mini&s;ters ever enjoyed a more uninterrupted &s;tate of health, going on with more &s;teady con&s;tancy in his public labors for the Lord.</P>
<P>His di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit were chiefly upon the di&s;tingui&s;hing, and mo&s;t important points of chri&s;tianity, relative both to faith &amp; practice. They
<PB N="20" REF="011206_0018_0F862C3CE749C510">
were the effect of &s;tudy; compo&s;ures di&s;covering judgment, and an intimate acquaintance with the holy &s;criptures. His manner in delivering them was &s;erious, grave, &s;olemn; and &s;ometimes he ut|tered him&s;elf with a voice &s;o elevated with zeal, and &s;o modulated under the influence of a deeply affected heart, as that he arre&s;ted the attention of his hearers; putting them under advantage to be impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the importance of what he was &s;aying to them. The ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, in fulfillment of his promi&s;e, made to the Apo&s;tles, and &s;ucceeding go&s;pel-mini&s;ters, was graciou&s;ly pre&s;ent with him, to enliven his faith, to comfort his heart, and to &s;trengthen his hands in going on with re&s;olute, diligent, and per&s;evering fidelity in di&s;charging the great tru&s;t it had plea&s;ed God to commit to him; and his labors, thro' the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, were not in vain: Some, we tru&s;t, were by him, as the in&s;trument in the hands of Chri&s;t, "turned from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;in and &s;atan unto God"; while others, who had been walking "in the path of the ju&s;t", were enabled to walk on "&s;hining more and more" until they arrived at "perfect day". It is not to be doubted, but that, upon his entrance into the invi&s;ible world, he became a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e, among other "&s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect", who were formed by his mini&s;try, under the influ|ence of the holy Gho&s;t, for their admi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed company, beyond the grave.</P>
<P>He was in conver&s;ation agreably plea&s;ant; and the more &s;o, as his affability was ever mixed with a becoming gravity. He &s;eldom failed of intro|ducing di&s;cour&s;e that tended to &s;piritual edification.
<PB N="21" REF="011206_0019_0F862C3DA44195F0">
This was more e&s;pecially his manner in the latter part of his life. I que&s;tion, whether he allowed him&s;elf to go out of company without dropping &s;omething of the religious kind; and he did it &s;o naturally, without any appearance of affectation, that he left a te&s;timony in the hearts of all, to the greatne&s;s of his piety.</P>
<P>This indeed was eminently his glory. He was "a dovout man, one that feared God, and prayed alway". I find, in his private papers, the record of numerous days &s;et apart for &s;olemn prayer, often with fa&s;ting, mo&s;tly by him&s;elf alone, and &s;ome|times in union with others; at which times, you, the people of his charge, were particularly remem|bered before the throne of mercy. He had upon his mind an habitually prevailing &s;en&s;e of the &s;u|perintending government of God, both in the king|dom of providence, and of grace; and he accord|ingly ever repaired to him as the alone all-&s;ufficient help. And this was e&s;pecially his practice under the various tryals he was called to pa&s;s through, &s;ome of which were grievou&s;ly heavy, and gave opportunity, as well as occa&s;ion, for the &s;ignal ex|erci&s;e of that "faith and patience through which" he is gone to "inherit the promi&s;es". His whole conduct indeed was a bright pattern of tho&s;e chri|&s;tian graces, which, being &s;o often thrown out into act, became in him the governing principles of life. You of this Society are "witne&s;&s;es, and God al&s;o, how holily, and ju&s;tly, and unblamably he behav|ed" among you. "What&s;oever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, (decent, comely) what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever
<PB N="22" REF="011206_0020_0F862C3F538B0188">
things are of good report":&mdash;The&s;e were the things in which he was an example to you, and to the whole town; who are all ready to ri&s;e up, and &s;peak of him as one they venerated for his con&s;pi|cuous piety, uprightne&s;s, and univer&s;al goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>His con&s;cience, from his youthful days, was re|markably tender. This made him, all along in life, watchful over his heart, and ways; and en|gaged his care to "ab&s;tain from even the appear|ance of evil". The life of no one was more freed from the defilements of &s;in. He was, in an un|common degree, "blamele&s;s and harmle&s;s; a &s;on of God without rebuke in the mid&s;t of a perver&s;e generation, among whom he &s;hined". Po&s;&s;ibly, he might be &s;crupulous to an exce&s;s. And if he was herefrom re&s;trained, at any time, from tho&s;e exertions which would have tended to good, it ought to be a&s;cribed to that "awe of God", which was habitually and powerfully pre&s;ent in his mind. Whenever duty lay clearly open to his view, he acted with vigor and boldne&s;s; as being influenced from that love of God, which overpowered the fear of man.</P>
<P>He was di&s;tingui&s;hed among the Clergy for his wi&s;dom, not "the wi&s;dom of this world", to which he was an utter &s;tranger; but "the wi&s;dom that is from above, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, ea&s;ie to be intreated, full of mercy and good <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, without partiality, and without hypocri&s;ie". I know of no man that di&s;covered more prudent caution, through his whole behavior in life. He ever acted, e&s;pecially in affairs of importance, with deliberation, and upon having viewed them in their
<PB N="23" REF="011206_0021_0F862C3FEE1F01C0">
circum&s;tances, and probable con&s;equences. No one, I believe, can mention an in&s;tance wherein he conducted with precipitant ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>In con&s;ideration of the many good qualities in which he excelled, he was, &s;o long ago as the year 1724, upon the death of Pre&s;ident Leverett, cho|&s;en, in his room, to take the head &s;hip of Harvard-College, in Cambridge. Upon the news of this, which, as his own words are, was "&s;urpri&s;ing to him", I find him making that pious reflection, "O Lord! what am I, a &s;inful worm, that there &s;hould be any tho't of me for &s;o con&s;iderable a tru&s;t"! This choice of him to &s;o important a &s;ervice, lay with great weight upon his mind, partly from his own mode&s;t diffidence, but principally from the ardor of his affection towards you of this Church and congregation. He often carried the ca&s;e to God in humble earne&s;t prayer, and more than once &s;et apart a day for &s;olemn application to him who dwelleth on high for direction in an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence. On one of the&s;e days, he writes thus; "I be&s;ought the Lord to give all needed direction to the over&s;eers, the flock I &s;tand related to, and to my &s;elf. I al&s;o endeavoured to examine my&s;elf;&mdash;and, if I know my own heart, my in|clination is to abide with my dear people, and to &s;pend and be &s;pent in the work of the mini&s;try here, if this be the will of God, and mo&s;t for his glory. I think I can truly &s;ay, that no pro&s;pect of greater worldly honor, or gain, would prevail with me to leave this people; and that I do not account my life too dear to be &s;pent in the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t among them". You, the people of his charge, expre&s;&s;ed a like affection towards him, in
<PB N="24" REF="011206_0022_0F862C40AC81D450" MS="y">
your voted unwillingne&s;s to part with him. Upon which, your beloved Pa&s;tor, having again a&s;ked the direction of heaven, thus writes; "I &s;uppo&s;e that now God makes my way plain to give an an&s;wer in the negative, which I accordingly did"; adding that wi&s;h of piety, "Lord! provide a more &s;utable and &s;ufficient per&s;on for that important tru&s;t".</P>
<P>About four years after this, he was elected a member of the College-corporation; which tru&s;t he accepted, and executed with con&s;ciencious fidelity, and a becoming zeal to promote, among the &s;ons of HARVARD, not only learning in the liberal arts and &s;ciences, but religion al&s;o both in it's <HI>doctrinal</HI> and <HI>practical</HI> purity. He &s;u&s;tained this office, approving him&s;elf a &s;teady faithful friend to the true&s;t intere&s;t of the College, until it became inconvenient, by rea&s;on of his age, to attend the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices of it any longer. He was more than once generou&s;ly hand&s;ome in his donations to this Society.</P>
<P>When Mr. Belcher returned from England, Go|vernor of this Province, he brought for him the honor of a Diaploma from the famous univer&s;ity at Edinburgh, in Scotland, con&s;tituting him a Doctor in Divinity. This honor was conferred on him without his &s;eeking it, or indeed &s;o much as knowing any thing relative to it, until it was be|&s;towed on him.</P>
<P>He was, for many years, one of the commi&s;&s;i|oners from the London-Corporation for propagat|ing the go&s;pel in New-England, and parts adja|cent;
<PB N="25" REF="011206_0023_0F862C4168989400">
as al&s;o a corre&s;pondent-member of the So|ciety in Scotland, for promoting chri&s;tian know|ledge. And as his duty, in the&s;e tru&s;ts, re&s;pected the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t among the INDIAN natives, a more &s;utable per&s;on could not have been &s;elected, and commi&s;&s;ioned. His heart was &s;trongly touch|ed with pity towards the&s;e peri&s;hing barbarous people; and, from a deep &s;en&s;e of their unhappi|ne&s;s, through ignorance of the true God, and the only Savior, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he was ever di&s;po&s;ed to do whatever lay in his power, in execution of the tru&s;t that had been committed to him, to &s;erve the intere&s;t of their &s;ouls, according to the Go&s;pel-plan of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>It would be a great omi&s;&s;ion, if I did not make mention of him as one of tho&s;e "good men, for whom one would even dare to die". He was, in his temper, pitiful, tender-hearted, courteous, kind|ly affectioned; and, from principle as a chri&s;tian, he "forgat not to do good, and communicate", as he had opportunity, and according to his ability. It was his practice to lay by one full tenth of his income for the u&s;es of piety and charity. And &s;ometimes, as occa&s;ions in providence called for it, he went even beyond this. Many are gone to heaven, and many &s;till live on the earth, who were often relieved, under &s;traits and nece&s;&s;ities, by the di&s;tributions of his bounty. I doubt not, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will &s;ay to him, in the great day of judgment, "I was, in my my&s;tical body, an hun|gred, and thou gave&s;t me meat; I was thir&s;ty, and thou gave&s;t me drink; naked, and thou clothed&s;t me: I was &s;ick, and thou vi&s;ited&s;t me; I was in pri&s;on, and thou came&s;t unto me:" In con&s;e|quence
<PB N="26" REF="011206_0024_0F862C422D7373C8">
of which, we may hope, he will be&s;peak him in tho&s;e words of abounding grace, "come thou ble&s;&s;ed of my father, inherit the kingdom pre|pared for thee from the foundation of the world."</P>
<P>He was a &s;trenuous a&s;&s;erter of our civil and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical CHARTER-RIGHTS and PRIVILEDGES. He knew the value of them.&mdash;He knew they were the purcha&s;e of our fore-fathers at the expence of much labor, blood, and trea&s;ure.&mdash;He could not bear the thought of their being wre&s;ted out of our hands.&mdash;He e&s;teemed it our duty, in all wi&s;e, rea|&s;onable, and legal ways, to endeavour the pre&s;er|vation of them.&mdash;And it was the earne&s;t wi&s;h of his heart, that they might be fully enjoyed by us, and tran&s;mitted from us, in the fulle&s;t extent, to the late&s;t generations.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 26th of la&s;t Augu&s;t, the day on which he compleated FOURSCORE YEARS, he &s;pake to you from this de&s;k, with affectionate gratitude to God upon &s;uch an extraordinary oc|ca&s;ion, and &s;o as to endeavour your &s;piritual edifi|cation. He was not permitted, after this, to preach to you more than three or four times. It &s;eemed good to the wi&s;dom of God to confine him &s;everal months to his chamber; in which time he had op|portunity to di&s;pen&s;e, to the many who went to vi&s;it him, tho&s;e coun&s;els and in&s;tructions of piety, which, if it be not their own fault, may be of la&s;ting &s;piritual advantage to them. And occa&s;ion al&s;o was now offered him, in the providence of God, by the repeated attacks that were made upon his naturally firm, but now breaking, con&s;titution, for the ex|emplary exerci&s;e of faith, patience, and tho&s;e other
<PB N="27" REF="011206_0025_0F862C42EC83D408">
virtues, which adorned his character as a chri&s;tian, and go&s;pel-mini&s;ter, and reflected honor on his ma&s;ter and Lord, who&s;e grace, be&s;towed on him, now &s;hone with con&s;picuous lu&s;tre. It was plea|&s;ant to behold the peaceful, placid, re&s;igned, pray|ing frame he was in. He could, while life remain|ed in any con&s;iderable degree of &s;trength, &s;peak of dying with a cheerful countenance, and as one that "had a de&s;ire to depart, and to be with Chri&s;t, which is far better than to abide in the fle&s;h". I have &s;ometimes heard him, with a &s;olemnly en|gaging pathos, expre&s;s him&s;elf in the&s;e words, "Come Lord Je&s;us! come quickly"! His fear was, le&s;t he &s;hould not wait with due chri&s;tian &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, until his change &s;hould come. For &s;ome hours before his decea&s;e, he was unable to &s;peak; though he appeared to have the exerci&s;e of his un|der&s;tanding: And, doubtle&s;s, he breathed out his &s;oul, "calling upon God", and &s;aying, in &s;ome &s;uch language as that, "Lord Je&s;us, receive my &s;pirit"! Which, we tru&s;t, he graciou&s;ly did; &s;end|ing the holy angels, tho&s;e "mini&s;tring &s;pirits, who mini&s;ter to them who are heirs of &s;alvation", to convoy it &s;afe to that apartment of the invi&s;ible world, which is the a&s;&s;igned place of re&s;idence for "the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect".</P>
<P>I &s;hall make no apology for having &s;aid &s;o much to do honor to the memory of Dr SEWALL: Had I &s;aid le&s;s, it would have needed one. Such ex|amples of &s;hining virtue, and eminent u&s;efulne&s;s, are highly in&s;tructive, and &s;hould be held up to the view of the world; e&s;pecially in this day of grow|ing degeneracy. It would be un&s;utably to with|hold that, which would happily tend to promote
<PB N="28" REF="011206_0026_0F862C43CE5F1B90">
the honor of God, and the good of mankind, if no ju&s;t notice &s;hould be taken of tho&s;e, who have &s;o worthily &s;erved God, and their generation ac|cording to his will.</P>
<P>It may have moved the pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e nearly related to the decea&s;ed, while attending to the cha|racter that has been given of him; but if they weep, it &s;hould be for them&s;elves, not for him; as they have &s;uch abundant rea&s;on to believe, that he has "entered into the joy of his Lord". May they be enabled to make a wi&s;e and holy u&s;e of this di&s;|pen&s;ation in the alwi&s;e providence of God!</P>
<P>We unite in our prayers for the only &s;on, and immediate de&s;cendant from him who&s;e death we are &s;olemni&s;ing. Be thankful to God for the &s;ignal ad|vantage you enjoyed in having &s;o good a father, and in having him continued a ble&s;&s;ing to you for &s;o protracted a &s;pace of time. His prayers for you, e&s;pecially for your &s;piritual welfare, were frequent and earne&s;t. He &s;carce ever &s;et apart a day for prayer, which was a common thing with him, but you are mentioned by name, in his records, as hav|ing had a &s;pecial &s;hare in his &s;upplications before the throne of grace. May they be an&s;wered in the be&s;towment of all needed favors on you, e&s;pecially of &s;piritual and eternal ble&s;&s;ings thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t! Your children are, &s;ome of them, in childhood, others in their youthful days. It would be an oc|ca&s;ion of joy to their grand-parent, even in para|di&s;e, could he know that they are "found walking in the truth, as they have received a commandment from the father". And could he &s;peak to them from the excellent glory, as he often did while here on

earth, it would be in &s;ome &s;uch language as that, "remember now your Creator in the days of your childhood and youth;&mdash;know ye the God of your fathers, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind: If ye &s;eek him, he will be found of you; but if ye for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t you off forever". Let me, who was your grand|father's friend, and relative, be permitted, in his &s;tead, now he is gone, to exhort you, my children, in your earlie&s;t days, to devote your&s;elves to the honor of your maker, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t the redeemer; taking him to be your in&s;tructor, guide, God, and everla&s;ting portion. This will be your be&s;t guard again&s;t the temptations of an evil world; this will yield you mo&s;t &s;atisfaction all along in life; this will be your &s;upport and comfort in the day of death; and this, of the rich mercy of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will &s;ecure your eternal wel|fare in the &s;tate that is beyond the grave. The good Lord impre&s;s your young and tender minds with a deep &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things, which are infi|nitely important!</P>
<P>It may be e&s;teemed a frown in providence, that the ELISHA of this chri&s;tian Society &s;hould not be pre&s;ent to &s;ee their ELIJAH taken away, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in making a &s;anctified improvement of &s;uch a vi&s;itation. Had he been here, he might with propriety have "cried, my father, my father, the chariot of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof"! Nor could he have made a better adapted prayer for him&s;elf than that, "let a double portion of thy &s;pirit re&s;t upon me"! May it plea&s;e the Savior of his people to help him under his infirmities, to pro&s;per his long journey for the removal of them,

We cannot wi&s;h for him a greater ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The death we are taking a religious notice of, is a loud call to the town in general, and to it's mini&s;ters in particular; and the louder, as it was preceeded, the week before, with the death of a|nother of it's mo&s;t ancient and valuable laborers in the work of the Go&s;pel. The like was never known, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the town, until now. Such reiterated di&s;pen&s;ations, in the righte|ous and holy government of heaven, de&s;erve a more than ordinary attention. The voice of God, e&s;pecially to the mini&s;ters here, is that, "be ye al&s;o ready";&mdash;"work the work of him that &s;ent you, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work". May they "to day hear his voice, and not harden their hearts"! This voice from God more e&s;pecially &s;peaks to tho&s;e among us who are advanced in years. We are told by it, that we &s;hall "&s;hortly put off the&s;e our tabernacles". The Lord impre&s;s our hearts with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of this &s;erious and important truth! And may we here|from be powerfully guarded again&s;t being "neg|ligent to put" the people of our re&s;pective charges "in remembrance" of the great truths of God and religion; and equally excited, "as long as we are in the&s;e tabernacles, to &s;tir them up" by calling their attention to the&s;e things, which are infinitely intere&s;ting and important! And may we &s;o "take

<P>Permit me now to leave a few &s;ea&s;onable words with the flock of Chri&s;t in this place; which, if received in love, and duly deliberated on, may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, be profitable to you.</P>
<P>Be thankful to the great "head over all things to the church, which is his body", for the rich gift you received from him, when he gave you your now decea&s;ed pa&s;tor.&mdash;Take a becoming notice of the uncommon kindne&s;s of heaven in continuing him to you, with &s;o little interruption in his work, for &s;o long a period as nearly fifty &s;ix years.&mdash; Con&s;ider his death as brought about, as to it's manner, and in all it's circum&s;tances, under the &s;uper-intending agency of that glorious Sovereign, "who&s;e throne is in the heavens, and who&s;e king|dom ruleth over all"; and give him the honor of a profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his alwi&s;e and righte|ous plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Enquire each one of you, what effect the me&s;&s;a|ges, God was plea&s;ed to &s;end you by this his &s;er|vant, have had upon you. Some of you, it may be, have been awakened to attend to the concerns of your &s;ouls.&mdash;Do not re&s;t &s;atisfied, until you have &s;o gone to Chri&s;t, as to be in a &s;tate of &s;afety, re&s;pecting the eternal world! Some of you, it may be, have been &s;avingly converted to God;&mdash;while you a&s;cribe to him the glory of his rich grace, re|tain in your minds a becoming affection for the in&s;trument u&s;ed in the conveyance of it. Some of you, it may be, have been &s;upported and comfort|ed under &s;piritual fears and temptations, or out|ward

di&s;tre&s;&s;ing difficulties, while others have been encouraged, and &s;trengthened to go on with chear|fulne&s;s, &s;peed, re&s;olution and vigor, in the way to|wards the heavenly kingdom;&mdash;you will never forget him, who, under God, has been &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing to you. His name, with you, will be as "precious ointment". Some of you, it may be, have turned a deaf ear to die many warnings he has &s;olemnly given you, from this de&s;k, in the name of the Lord; "&s;etting at nought all his coun&s;els", and practically throwing contempt upon his reproofs: You have abundant rea&s;on for deep humiliation before God. Let me urge you to ari&s;e out of your &s;leep in &s;in, and to call on God, if perhaps he may grant you repentantce and for|givene&s;s. This only will &s;ave you from the wrath to come.</P>
<P>In a word, you &s;hould all frequently call to mind the great truths pertaining to the kingdom of God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which you have had &s;o pre&s;|&s;ingly delivered to you. "I be&s;eech you, bre|thren, and exhort you, by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that, as ye have received" of your decea&s;ed pa&s;tor "how ye ought to walk, &s;o ye would abound more and more". Be not "led away with the error of the wicked"&mdash;"fall not from your &s;ted|fa&s;tne&s;s; but "give all diligence to add to your faith every other chri&s;tian grace". For "if the&s;e things be in you, and abound, ye &s;hall never fall; but entrance &s;hall be mini&s;tred to you abundantly into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord, and Sa|vior Je&s;us Chri&s;t".</P>
<P>You are, by rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent di&s;tance of your &s;urviving pa&s;tor, as &s;heep without a &s;hepherd.
<PB N="33" REF="011206_0031_0F862C4823B15440">
May it plea&s;e "the great Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of &s;ouls" to keep you from "going a&s;tray", to pre|&s;erve your union in love, to direct your &s;teps, and govern your whole conduct, in your pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances, &s;o as that your &s;piritual advantage may thereby be promoted in the end!</P>
<P>I &s;hall not think it impertinent, becau&s;e not un|&s;ea&s;onable, to &s;ay here, though out of place, that Dr. SEWALL, after he had been excu&s;ed, at his own repeated de&s;ire, on account of the infirmities of age, from taking his turn at the THURSDAY-LECTURE, was prevailed on to preach it once more, when he thought it his duty to bear his la&s;t, and, as it were, dying te&s;timony again&s;t the &s;hameful neglect with which this religious opportunity was treated; at the &s;ame time, offering that which was powerfully adapted to awaken a concern in all &s;erious minds to improve this &s;pecial &s;ea&s;on for their &s;piritual good, as they might ea&s;ily do it, in much greater numbers, without damage to their &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s. The pious and well-judged ad|dre&s;s he was enabled to make, upon this occa&s;ion, had a temporary good effect. The lecture was ob&s;ervably better attended;&mdash;but there &s;oon came on a relap&s;e into that &s;ame carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, which he had reproved, and endeavoured to guard again&s;t. Surely, our churches here have lo&s;t their fir&s;t love to God's wor&s;hip, and zeal to improve &s;utable op|portunities for their edification in faith and holi|ne&s;s! And they &s;hould "remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their fir&s;t works". That prayer was never more pertinent, than at this day; "revive thy work, O Lord", in the&s;e de|clining churches! And &s;hould it plea&s;e God to do
<PB N="34" REF="011206_0032_0F862C4BF9865950">
this, I may venture to &s;ay, without pretending to the &s;pirit of prophecy, that there will not then be &s;o thin, and &s;candalous an appearance at our FIFTH-DAY-LECTURE.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, as occa&s;ion is given us, in the government of providence, to adopt the language of &s;cripture, and &s;ay, "our fathers where are they? and the prophets do they live for ever"? We &s;hould be in the exerci&s;e of faith in the only living God, with whom is "the re&s;idue of the Spirit"; tru&s;ting that he will rai&s;e up, qualifie, and &s;end forth, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e, who &s;hall &s;upport his cau&s;e, and &s;hine more con&s;picuou&s;ly in his Church, than any who have gone before.</P>
<P>Now "to him who only hath immortality"; who is "the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day, and forever"; who is "God over all from everla&s;ting to ever|la&s;ting":&mdash;To him be given all glory and honor, dominion and ble&s;&s;ing, by all creatures in heaven and earth, throughout the endle&s;s ages of Eternity. AMEN AND AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. From the Bo&s;ton <HI>Evening-Po&s;t,</HI> of July 3d. 1769.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>BOSTON</HI>
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 29. 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ON Tue&s;day Evening la&s;t died the Reverend JOSEPH SEWALL, D. D. &s;enior Pa&s;tor of the South Church in this Town, in the 81&s;t Year of his Age.</P>
<P>Dr. SEWALL's de&s;cent was honourable&mdash;His Father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hon. SAMUEL SEWALL, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></NOTE> was elected a Magi&s;trate of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Colony 1684, was afterwards appointed one of the fir&s;t Council under the pre&s;ent Charter, and was annually elected until 1725, when he re&s;igned his Seat at the Council-Board&mdash; He was al&s;o many years Chief Ju&s;tice of the Province and Judge of Probates for the County of Suffolk, and was one of the mo&s;t eminent Per&s;ons of his day for piety, learning, wi&s;dom, integrity and univer&s;al charity.</P>
<P>The Son was every way worthy of &s;uch an excellent Father. Scarce any one ever pa&s;&s;ed through life with a more unblemi&s;hed character, or performed its various duties with more univer&s;al e&s;teem.</P>
<P>He who formeth the &s;pirit of man within him, was plea&s;ed to favour him with valuable intellectual endow|ments; the&s;e were rendered more bright and u&s;eful by his literary acompli&s;hments&mdash;He particuarly excelled as a cla&s;&s;ic &s;cholar; and retained his cla&s;&s;ical learning to an uncommon degree in his advanced years&mdash; But the gifts of nature and all his acquired learning were eclip&s;ed by his exalted piety and exemplary virtue.</P>
<P>He was under the influence of religion from his early days. While but a youth, there was &s;uch an uncommon &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trict regularity in his whole walk, as at|tracted the notice of all his acquaintance, and command|ed re&s;pect even from tho&s;e who were &s;uperior to him in age.&mdash;Tho' his family was among the fir&s;t in the coun|try, both for dignity and e&s;tate, he aimed at nothing
<PB N="36" REF="011206_0034_0F862C4D8E5E5C28">
higher than to &s;erve God in the mini&s;try of his Son.&mdash; Divinity was always his favourite &s;tudy, not &s;o much from duty as inclination. The &s;ubject &s;uted his ta&s;te, as it led him to a more intimate acquaintance with God, and tended to improve his mind in piety and holine&s;s.</P>
<P>The South Church no &s;ooner had a ta&s;te of his gifts, than they invited him to take part of the mini&s;try with that great and good man the late Rev. Mr. PEMBERTON. He was ordained over them Sept. 16, 1713, and con|tinued almo&s;t con&s;tantly to carry on the work of the mini&s;try till the la&s;t year of his life.</P>
<P>From his childhood he knew the holy &s;criptures, his acquaintance with them encrea&s;ed as he grew in years&mdash; He could recite them with an exactne&s;s to which few have attained, and knew how to explain and apply them with readine&s;s and propriety, both in public and in private. "From the&s;e he extracted his Divinity; from the&s;e, the maxims of his conduct; and by the&s;e, was made wi&s;e to &s;alvation"</P>
<P>His preaching was &s;olid, &s;criptural, in&s;tructive and pathetic&mdash;He had a clear and di&s;tinct apprehen&s;ion of the truths of religion, and well under&s;tood the analogy of faith&mdash;He did not entertain his hearers with the &s;ubtleties of the &s;chools, or with curious and unprofitable &s;peculati|ons&mdash;His chief care was to explain and enforce the great articles of the chri&s;tian faith and evangelical rules of life; to teach what we mu&s;t believe, and how we mu&s;t live, in order to be eternally happy&mdash; He was in principle a Calvini&s;t, and made the doctrines, which are u&s;ually call|ed the doctrines of Grace, the foundation, and the chief &s;ubjects of his preaching; but he was far from the dan|gerous extremes to which &s;ome have carried the&s;e doct|rines. While he was &s;olicitous to &s;ecure the honor of divine grace, he was equally careful to &s;how the nece&s;|&s;ity of holy obedience, and earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed on unrenew|ed &s;inners the importance of their improving the means of grace, if they had any de&s;ire to obtain an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and to become his &s;incere di&s;ciples. He convey|ed his &s;entiments in ea&s;y, cha&s;te language; and delivered him&s;elf with that becoming gravity, and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, that commanding elocution and decent affection, as almo&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="011206_0035_0F862C4E27A2DDA8">
nece&s;&s;arily engaged the attention of the a&s;&s;embly, and greatly tended to impre&s;s their minds and reach their hearts. He had an inward vital &s;en&s;e of religion, that animated his di&s;cour&s;es with the &s;ame divine pa&s;&s;ions he felt in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He di&s;charged the other parts of his &s;acred tru&s;t with prudence and fidelity, diligence and impartiality, warn|ing every man and teaching every man in all wi&s;dom, not only publicly but from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, that he might pre&s;ent every man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Having obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, he did not run in vain nor labour in vain. There is rea&s;on to believe, that no &s;mall number, now among the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, are ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;ing God for him, as the in&s;trument of that happine&s;s they now enjoy; and that there are many yet living, who are the &s;eals of his mini&s;try, and will be his crown and joy in the day of the Lord. His whole deportment was a proof of the truth of religion. It is hard to &s;ay what virtues were mo&s;t eminent in him, he &s;at &s;uch a &s;hining example of all. He always &s;eemed to have a &s;en&s;e of God upon his mind, and earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd after a nearer con|formity to his Divine Ma&s;ter. He kept at a great di&s;t|ance from that u&s;ele&s;s and trifling Manner of conver|&s;ing, which vi&s;ibly di&s;graces the character of too many Chri&s;tans. He &s;carce ever enter'd into company but &s;omething &s;erious and good dropt from his lips. His very pre&s;ence bani&s;hed every thing of levity, and &s;olem|nized the minds of all who were with him&mdash;and yet there was &s;uch a mixture of decent chearfulne&s;s that every one was fond of his Society.</P>
<P>Prayer was the delight of his &s;oul. He was frequent in his retired devotions, and was ever ready to join with others in this &s;acred exerci&s;e. He &s;eemed to breathe his native air when he drew near to the throne of grace&mdash; and was not willing to engage in any affair of importance, without having fir&s;t made his religious acknowledgments to the God of heaven. His public prayers were &s;erious, pertinent and pathetic&mdash;and he prayed always with all prayer almo&s;t in a literal &s;en&s;e, as his mind was always heaven ward, and there was &s;omething in his attitude and
<PB N="38" REF="011206_0036_0F862C4EEB2ACFD0">
appearance that led us to think he was continually &s;ending up pious ejaculations; and yet his religion was &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o natural, and &s;o graceful, that none ever charged him with affectation, or imagined that he aimed at the prai&s;e of men. His prayers were accompanied with alms&mdash;He con&s;tantly devoted a tenth part of his income to pious and charitable u&s;es.&mdash;He hath di&s;per&s;ed, he hath given to the poor, his righteou&s;ne&s;s endureth forever.</P>
<P>His heart was exceeding tender, and he &s;acredly ad|heared to the dictates of con&s;cience&mdash;&s;crupulou&s;ly afraid in all his tran&s;actions of doing wrong, no arguments or per&s;ua&s;ions could prevail with him to act at all, until he was &s;atisfied he &s;hould act right. A &s;olidity and exact|ne&s;s of judgment, even in ca&s;es of great difficulty; and a di&s;tingui&s;hing prudence both in public and private life, made him ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the wi&s;e&s;t men of his day. His natural caution, improved by religion unto holy watchfulne&s;s, render'd him to the la&s;t degree careful not to give any ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence; but when the cau&s;e of God required it, he was zealous, re&s;olved and coura|gious. He bore a faithful te&s;timony again&s;t prevailing errors and fa&s;hionable vices, how great &s;oever the character of tho&s;e who patronized them. "No pretence could make him tran&s;gre&s;s his own line, and from the duties of his po&s;t nothing could move him. His &s;pirit was truly pacifie, and could &s;acrifice every thing but duty for peace; and accounted nothing too dear but truth and holine&s;s, for the purcha&s;e of it".</P>
<P>He had a great veneration for our excellent Fathers, and could not calmly hear them reproached or vilified. He thought their magnanimity in encountering &s;o many dan|gers for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving the rights of con&s;cience, and their wi&s;dom and piety in laying &s;uch happy foun|dations, both civil and religious, ought to cover any lit|tle mi&s;takes they might have fallen into. He was greatly alarmed with every motion to introduce the Hierarchy into the&s;e Colonies, who&s;e predece&s;&s;ors had, at the peril of every earthly comfort, fled from the face of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal tyranny. Nor was he le&s;s jealous of the attempts made to deprive us of our civil liberties. Though he warmly pre&s;&s;'d &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the powers that be, while
<PB N="39" REF="011206_0037_0F862C4FB5D8CE28">
they are the mini&s;ters of God for good to their &s;ubjects, yet he was greatly affected with the encroachments lately made upon us, and could not think a people were to be blamed for adhering to their rights and privileges, that had been purcha&s;ed at &s;o dear a rate. The&s;e things lay with weight on his mind as long as he lived, he &s;pake with freedom, and &s;ome degree of warmth, on this inte|re&s;ting topic, and often addre&s;&s;ed heaven to interpo&s;e for our relief. His prayers, we tru&s;t, have been heard and will be graciou&s;ly an&s;wered.</P>
<P>With &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of virtues, and &s;uch an uni|form cour&s;e of life, it is no wonder Dr. SEWALL lived in the highe&s;t reputation; venerated by all, loved and e|&s;teemed by the wi&s;e and good; he received the highe&s;t honors which were con&s;i&s;tent with his &s;tation of life.&mdash; On the decea&s;e of the Hon. and Rev. Pre&s;ident LEVER|ETT, in the year 1724, he was cho&s;en to pre&s;ide over Harvard-College, but his Church not con&s;enting to re&s;ign him at the call of the public, he re&s;pectfully declined the honorable tru&s;t to which he had been invited. In 1728, on the re&s;ignation of Dr. COLMAN, he was elected a Fel|low of the Corporation, and faithfully attended the duties of that &s;tation until 1765, when his age and infirmities obliged him to re&s;ign. He had a great and &s;incere con|cern for the intere&s;t of religion and learning in that So|ciety, and expre&s;&s;ed his regard by many important &s;ervices. A few years &s;ince he made a generous donation to the College in money, the income to be for the help of indi|gent &s;cholars. When Harvard Hall was con&s;umed by fire, he was one of the fir&s;t to repair the lo&s;s, by a pre&s;ent of many cho&s;en and valuable Authors out of his own library.</P>
<P>In the year 1731, he was created Doctor of Divinity, by the Univer&s;ity of Gla&s;gow &mdash;He was appointed one of their Commi&s;&s;ioners by the Honourable Corporation in London for the propagation of the Go&s;pel in New-Eng|land and parts adjacent; and once and again a corre&s;pon|dent member by the Society in Scotland for promoting Chri&s;tian Knowledge. Indeed, there was no public in|&s;titution &s;uted to his &s;tation and character, in which the undertakers did not think it an honor to have Dr. SEW|ALL an a&s;&s;ociate; none calculated to promote the intere&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="011206_0038_0F862C506D1AEBB8">
of Chri&s;t's kingdom, in which he did not willingly en|gage; and when engaged, he punctually attended their re&s;pective meetings; being as willing to do the duty, as to have the honor, of a public tru&s;t.</P>
<P>The Lord of life was plea&s;ed to continue his u&s;eful|ne&s;s to a good old age; the evening after he had com|pleated his 80th year, he preached to a &s;erious and affect|ed audience, when he took a humble and thankful notice of the &s;paring mercy of God to him. The Lord's day following he was &s;eized with a paralytic di&s;order, which &s;oon put an end to his public labors, and confined him to his hou&s;e. But though incapable of public &s;ervice, he was &s;till employed in his Ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s. As he was vi&s;ited by great numbers, de&s;irous of hearing the la&s;t words of the a&s;cending Prophet, &s;o he was ince&s;&s;ant in his coun&s;els, directions and prayers. Here you might &s;ee the humble gracious &s;aint. Others were ready to applaud the rectitude and uniformity of his life, his diligence and fidelity in his Lord's work. He, on the other hand, ex|pre&s;s'd his &s;en&s;e of his own defects, acknowledged him&s;elf an unprofitable &s;ervant, bewailed the remains of &s;in, and looked to the atoning &s;acrifice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for pardon and acceptance. In his long and tedious &s;ickne&s;s, he was a pattern of patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as in his health he had been an example of holy living. He encountered the apprehen&s;ions of death, like one who believed and hoped for immortality. He enjoy'd to the la&s;t a &s;teady peace and &s;erenity of mind, and &s;pake of un&s;een and eter|nal things with a &s;en&s;ible gu&s;t and reli&s;h, as if his &s;oul had been upon the wing, and he had &s;ome foreta&s;te of the joy, which we have almo&s;t a &s;ure and certain hope he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.&mdash;</P>
<P>His Remains were this day attended to the Grave with every mark of re&s;pect due to &s;o excellent a Per&s;on.&mdash;</P>
