<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE REASONS OF THE Conduct of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Face of Affairs in <HI>Eu|rope</HI> is, within the &s;pace of the la&s;t Year, &s;o much altered, that it is al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t uncon|cerned Spectator to prevent his Thoughts from running out into Que&s;tions and Suppo&s;itions about it. Curio&s;ity it &s;elf, the lowe&s;t Principle of all our Enquiries, will force its Way into &s;uch a Scene: And will expect, or invent, &s;ome Account of &s;o &s;urprizing a <HI>Change;</HI> from a Calm hardly paralleled by any pa&s;t <HI>Pro&s;perity,</HI> to a &s;ud|den Gathering of Clouds; which, if not &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, mu&s;t bur&s;t, and di&s;charge them&s;elves &s;ome where or other.</P>
<P>But when Self-Intere&s;t is joined to this na|tural Curio&s;ity, and it becomes a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="002880_0003_0FE685B2651B86E8"><HI>National</HI> Concern, to know the main Cau&s;es and Springs of &s;uch Events, as All are intere&s;ted in; there &s;eems then to be a Right, &s;trictly &s;o cal|led, to demand and receive all the Satisfaction the Nature of &s;uch Affairs can permit to be gi|ven. In a free Nation e&s;pecially, where no Re|&s;olutions can be effectual without the Con&s;ent and &s;upport of the Community, every Man, who can think at all, will think it an injurious Treat|ment, if, at a proper Time, and in a proper Manner, &s;ome Light be not held forth to him; and &s;ome &s;atisfactory Solution given of &s;uch Appearances, as mu&s;t otherwi&s;e very much perplex and di&s;turb him. And one Thing <HI>Go|vernours</HI> them&s;elves are &s;ure to find, That un|le&s;s they &s;hew &s;uch a Regard to Tho&s;e who ju&s;t|ly think they have a Claim to it, this Evil will come to pa&s;s, that Mankind (always di&s;po&s;ed enough towards Di&s;&s;atisfaction, either through a &s;ort of natural Ill-will to Tho&s;e above them, or through a Wearine&s;s under the Continuance of the &s;ame <HI>Admini&s;tration,</HI> or through an af|fected <HI>Popularity,</HI> or real <HI>Patrioti&s;m</HI> not &s;uffi|ciently in&s;tructed) will take that Side of the Pro&s;pect to dwell upon, which will af<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">d them mo&s;t Matter for Satyr at Home; and lay all the Load upon the Conduct of Tho&s;e, in who&s;e Time of Power &s;uch a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of Political Affairs appears in the World.</P>
<P>All this was never more true, than in this Nation, and at this Time. Every <HI>Briton</HI> who, either by his Trea&s;ure or his Blood, by his Vote or his Intere&s;t, by his Per&s;on or his Re|pre&s;entative, has in Time pa&s;t bor'n any part
<PB N="5" REF="002880_0004_0FE6858466EC2068">in procuring the common Peace, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;everal Intere&s;ts of <HI>Europe:</HI> Every &s;uch Member of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, who, by this Time flatter'd him&s;elf with Hopes of enjoying the Re&s;ult of all our Toil, and Taxes, and Blood, in an Univer&s;al Peace, and an extended undi&s;turbed Commerce, has a Right to ask,&mdash; How comes this Face of Things to be again over|clouded?&mdash;All <HI>Europe</HI> once more in Agitation&mdash; Three Fleets from <HI>Britain</HI> fitted out at a Great Expence, and with the utmo&s;t Expedition &s;ent to &s;everal parts of the World:&mdash;And, what is mo&s;t unaccountable, the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Powers that could hardly be kept within the Bounds of common Decency, towards one ano|ther, by all the Addre&s;s of two powerful Medi|ators in a publick Treaty, abandoning that Mediation; and, in the middle of it, privately running into one another's Arms, and uniting, in De&s;igns de&s;tructive to the <HI>Commerce</HI> and <HI>Rights</HI> of other Nations, with all the Marks of Cordial Affection, and a Re&s;olute Friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>Is not This, the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>&mdash;of that Coun|try, which has always felt the Want of the Friend&s;hip of <HI>Britain,</HI> more than of That of all other Nations be&s;ides; to &s;uch a Degree, that it has pa&s;&s;ed into a <HI>Proverb</HI> throughout the King|dom, <HI>Paz con</HI> Inglat&eacute;rra, <HI>con todos otros la Guerra: Peace with</HI> England, <HI>and War with all the World be&s;ides?</HI> &mdash; of that <HI>Country,</HI> which reaps more Advantage from the Trade with <HI>England,</HI> than from that of all its other Neighbours put together?&mdash;And, Is not this
<PB N="6" REF="002880_0005_0FE68625EBD0E370">the &s;ame King, who&s;e Engagements to the <HI>Inte|re&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> in <HI>his</HI> Country, are as &s;olemn and &s;trong, as the mo&s;t expre&s;s Trea|ties can make them?&mdash;The &s;ame, who ju&s;t before the Opening the Congre&s;s at <HI>Cambray,</HI> owned and ratified them all, by acceding in Form to the <HI>Quadruple Alliance;</HI> and accepting, by That, the Mediation of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>And above all, if we turn our Eyes to the <HI>Emperor;</HI> Is not This the <HI>Prince,</HI> whom we once bore upon <HI>our</HI> Shoulders, out of the Reach of all his Enemies, and &s;upported by <HI>our</HI> Strength, in the Time of his own greate&s;t Weakne&s;s?&mdash; The <HI>Prince,</HI> whom <HI>our</HI> Zeal, and <HI>our</HI> Fleets, and <HI>our</HI> Trea&s;ure, laboured to &s;ix upon the Throne of <HI>Spain,</HI> at a Time when Difficulties and Dangers &s;urrounded the whole Imperial Hou&s;e at <HI>Vienna?</HI>&mdash;And now, Ve&s;ted, as we always wi&s;hed Him to be, with the High and Augu&s;t Dignity He enjoys; Is not this the <HI>Emperor,</HI> who may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to owe the Pre|&s;ervation even of all his Hereditary Countries, and of his Imperial Crown it &s;elf, (if we may have liberty to &s;ay &s;o,) to that hazardous and unequalled March of the Confederate Army in|to <HI>Germany,</HI> and to the happy Con&s;equences of it? To that <HI>Victory,</HI> in which the <HI>Briti&s;h, Dutch, Hanoverian, Pru&s;&s;ian,</HI> and <HI>He&s;&s;ian</HI> Troops bore &s;o great a part; and, in a particular Manner, to that <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General, who projected and condu|cted the <HI>Whole?</HI>&mdash; And the &s;ame <HI>Emperor,</HI> who, as He was throughout the la&s;t War, the chief Object of the Love and good Wi&s;hes of this Nation, &s;o, at the End of it, was e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="7" REF="002880_0006_0FE685A51C6C0040">in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Flanders;</HI> and owes <HI>O&s;tend</HI> it &s;elf to tho&s;e victorious Arms, which had be|fore &s;upported his Per&s;on, and pre&s;erved the <HI>Em|pire</HI> for him? And all this long Scene of Ser|vice and Toil, entred into and pro&s;ecuted by us, We mu&s;t own, again&s;t the repeatad Remon|&s;trances of <HI>many,</HI> that We were ha&s;tening apace to make Him a Power too great and too for|midable; and that we &s;hould find in <HI>Him</HI> at la&s;t, the Enemy we then dreaded only in <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>It is natural for every <HI>Briton</HI> to look back, and to ask the&s;e and the like Que&s;tions. And the next Thought which &s;ucceeds, is almo&s;t as natural; That it is hardly to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e Powers &s;hould take &s;uch Steps, without &s;omething to ju&s;tify them. We can hardly im|agine it po&s;&s;ible, That, without &s;ome real and high Provocation, the <HI>Emperor</HI> could throw any the lea&s;t Indignity upon the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great Bri|tain;</HI> or act any injurious or even hard Part towards a Nation who had &s;acrificed &s;o much Trea&s;ure and &s;o much Blood to his Service. And therefore we are apt enough to conclude, (and have Rea&s;on to do &s;o, till we find it otherwi&s;e) That &s;ome great Mi&s;management on the Part of <HI>Britain;</HI> &s;ome unju&s;tifiable Partiality towards Others; &s;ome Breach of Faith; &s;ome Outrage or other in Politicks, has been committed again&s;t his <HI>Imperial Maje&s;ty:</HI> Or, that &s;ome unpardona|ble Behaviour on our Part, with Regard to his ju&s;t Intere&s;ts, mu&s;t have been the Occa&s;ion of a Con|duct that &s;o far exceeds the Common Maxims
<PB N="8" REF="002880_0007_0FE6460F8C00FB98">of Princes and States towards one ano|ther.</P>
<P>And indeed, I &s;hall be very free to own, If this be the Ca&s;e; if either &s;olemn <HI>Treaties,</HI> or any Engagements, with the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> have been broke through; if either Affronts, or even Neg|lects, incon&s;i&s;tent with the Duty of a faithful Ally, have been Part of the Conduct of the <HI>pre|&s;ent</HI> Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> towards his <HI>Imperial Maje&s;ty;</HI> former Appearances ought not be &s;poken of; all pa&s;t Obligations ought to be as nothing in the pre&s;ent Account: The <HI>Emperor</HI> has a Right to guard and &s;trengthen him&s;elf by Treaties <HI>contrary</HI> to his former Treaties, and to act the Part He judges be&s;t for his own Honour and Security: And we of this Nation have no Right to tax <HI>Him,</HI> either with Ingratitude un|provoked, or with Breach of Faith without the Appearance of a Ju&s;tification; but ought to turn all our Zeal again&s;t Tho&s;e, who&s;e Coun&s;els, and who&s;e Behaviour, upon this Suppo&s;ition, have made &s;uch a Conduct on his part, wi&s;e, ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. And the &s;ame mu&s;t be acknowledged with Regard to <HI>Spain</HI> al&s;o; if any &s;uch <HI>Excu&s;e</HI> can ju&s;tly be alledged on that Side.</P>
<P>We will now, therefore, enquire What has been the Behaviour of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Nation</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &s;ince his pre&s;ent <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> came to the Throne, towards the <HI>Emperor</HI> particular|ly: And, as we pa&s;s, towards <HI>Spain</HI> al&s;o. And I will put the Account of this into <HI>two Periods.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;hall be, from his Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, to the Opening the <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> at <HI>Cambray:</HI> The <HI>Second,</HI> from the Opening of
<PB N="9" REF="002880_0008_0FE6857DC2EDA240">that <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> to the Signing of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> at <HI>Vienna</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>At the Time when his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> came to the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &s;everal Points of great Importance remain'd to be adju&s;ted, before the <HI>Peace</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI> could be e&s;teem'd as a Thing fix'd upon any la&s;ting and &s;olid Founda|tion; in particular, &s;ome Things very unea&s;y to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and others very much de&s;ired by <HI>Spain.</HI> In con&s;ideration of this, his Maje&s;ty, after other previous Treaties and Conventions, enter'd directly upon the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Points, which were fix'd in the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>London, July</HI> 22. 1718. entirely to the Enperor's Satisfaction: who was him&s;elf a <HI>Party</HI> in that Treaty, and confirm'd with his own Hand what his <HI>Mini&s;|ters</HI> had before &s;ign'd in his Name. His <HI>Ita|lian</HI> Dominions, always dear to him, He ju&s;tly thought not very &s;ecure, without the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Sicily;</HI> upon which the Pre&s;ervation of <HI>Na|ples</HI> very much depends. This great and im|portant Point, the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> fix'd, as a main Article of this <HI>Treaty:</HI> and engaged, in Concert with <HI>France,</HI> that, <HI>Sardinia</HI> being deliver'd up to the <HI>Emperor</HI> by <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Sicily</HI> &s;hould accept of that I&s;land in lieu of <HI>Sicily,</HI> which He &s;hould yield to the <HI>Emperor.</HI></P>
<P>On the Part of <HI>Spain,</HI> a Favourite Point was likewi&s;e &s;ettled. Don <HI>Carlos,</HI> Son to the pre|&s;ent <HI>Queen,</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Tu&s;cany, Parma,</HI> and <HI>Placentia:</HI> And This con|&s;ented to, by the <HI>Emperor,</HI> who alone was ca|pable of di&s;turbing it; and effectually guaran|teed by the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> I
<PB N="10" REF="002880_0009_0FE685CAF1781FA0">will at pre&s;ent name no other Particulars, but the&s;e <HI>two</HI> principal ones. Some other Points, Circum&s;tances, and Incidents, in order to perfect the Peace between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> re|main'd to be &s;ettled in a Congre&s;s, under the Mediation of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> And this <HI>Mediation</HI> made a Part and an expre&s;s Article of this <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> to which the <HI>Empe|ror</HI> long ago, and <HI>Spain</HI> afterwards, &s;et their Hands, and gave their &s;olemn Con&s;ent. The former of the two Articles now mentioned, <HI>viz. That</HI> relating to <HI>Sicily,</HI> did not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Words only; but was &s;oon actually put in Exe|cution; and the <HI>Emperor</HI> put in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>Hitherto, Nothing but <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> appears: And perhaps Friend&s;hip to Exce&s;s. What the <HI>Emperor</HI> exceedingly de&s;ired, is granted to Him: And nothing granted to <HI>Others,</HI> but what the <HI>Emperor</HI> him&s;elf had previou&s;ly con|&s;ented to, as a rea&s;onable and fitting <HI>Equi|valent.</HI> Neither had the King of <HI>Spain</HI> any Rea&s;on to complain, when the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> was put in &s;o &s;ure a Way of taking place at the Time appointed. So far indeed, was <HI>He</HI> from it; That, before the Open|ing of the <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> He him&s;elf acceded to the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and con&s;ented to all the Allotments made in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> was at length open'd at <HI>Cambray, Jan.</HI> 26. N. S. 1723-4. in order to &s;ettle all re|maining Uncertainties, under the Care of the two mediating Powers, <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> This will be a <HI>Second Period;</HI> from this Opening at
<PB N="11" REF="002880_0010_0FE685DF76C34598"><HI>Cambray,</HI> to the opening of another Scene at <HI>Vienna.</HI> And through the whole Management of this <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> the Part the <HI>Mediators</HI> acted, was &s;o impartial, &s;o equitable, &s;o agreeable to the Treaty of <HI>London,</HI> which was the Ba&s;is of this Congre&s;s; that the mo&s;t &s;olemn Ap|peal may be made to Both the <HI>conte&s;ting Powers,</HI> Whether any one Step was taken, which could give any the lea&s;t ju&s;t Ground of Complaint. No Appeal is, indeed, nece&s;&s;ary. The <HI>Imperial Court</HI> would loudly have complain'd of any Conduct; if there had been any towards that Court which could have de&s;erv'd it. But there never was any Complaint of that Sort from thence: Nor indeed could there have been any made, without di&s;covering at the &s;ame Time that there was nothing to complain of, but the too great Equity and Ju&s;tice ob&s;erv'd by the <HI>Me|diators</HI> between the two contending Powers; and their re&s;olute Adherence to all <HI>Treaties;</HI> and particularly to <HI>that</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> to which this Court it&s;elf had con&s;ented. Nor did <HI>Spain</HI> make the lea&s;t Complaint again&s;t the Behaviour of the <HI>mediating Powers,</HI> through the whole Progre&s;s of the Mediation; but what aro&s;e from the con|&s;tant Ju&s;tice of the Mediators, in keeping with|in the Bounds of their Duty and Honour, and their not giving into any new and exorbitant Demands of that Court.</P>
<P>Thus, therefore, &s;tands the Ca&s;e. Whil&s;t a <HI>Mediation</HI> was happily going on, under the Sanction of a &s;olemn Treaty, appointing this <HI>Mediation;</HI> and this <HI>Appointment</HI> &s;ign'd, and con&s;ented to, by the&s;e contending Crowns; with|out
<PB N="12" REF="002880_0011_0FE685D574E88A58">any apparent Di&s;&s;atisfaction, or even the lea&s;t Pretence for it, a <HI>private Treaty</HI> is enter'd into, carried on, and fini&s;h'd at <HI>Vienna;</HI> in plain Contradiction to that <HI>Article</HI> relating to the <HI>Me|diation,</HI> by which They had &s;olemnly obliged them&s;elves to &s;ettle the Points in Difference, under the Eye and Influence of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> And the whole conducted with the highe&s;t Di&s;re&s;pect to the mediating Powers, and without the lea&s;t &s;eeming De&s;ire of keeping the common Mea&s;ures of Decency with them. Con|&s;idering, therefore, only the Manner and Cir|cum&s;tances attending this Tran&s;action between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> at <HI>Vienna;</HI> as it was a Violation of an <HI>expre&s;s Article</HI> of a former Treaty &s;ign'd by Them&s;elves, and an high and unprovoked Indignity offered to the <HI>Mediators;</HI> the&s;e were alone enough to ju&s;tify the <HI>Mediators,</HI> in any publick act of due Re&s;entment of &s;uch U&s;age.</P>
<P>But &s;o far were They from &s;hewing any &s;uch Re&s;entment; &s;o far from making this open Af|front, the Occa&s;ion of an open Rupture; that, when the <HI>Signing of this Treaty was</HI> fir&s;t, in Form, notified to the two Courts of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> and it was declared to be no other than a <HI>Defen&s;ive</HI> one, with Regard only to the mutual Satisfaction of the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> and not contradictory, but perfectly agreeable, to the Treaty of <HI>London:</HI> So far were They from improving &s;uch U&s;age into a publick Quarrel, that both at Home, and by their Mini|&s;ters every where Abroad, They expre&s;s'd a great Plea&s;ure that the <HI>Two Powers,</HI> whom the <HI>Me|diators</HI> at <HI>Cambray</HI> could not bring even to
<PB N="13" REF="002880_0012_0FE6858C8C3DAEA8">Terms of common Civility towards one ano|ther, had found the happy Means, without the Ceremony and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any <HI>Mediator,</HI> to get over Difficulties that had been declared al|mo&s;t in&s;uperable; and to link them&s;elves in the Bands of Friend&s;hip, upon Terms, not incon|&s;i&s;tent (as it was affirm'd) with the <HI>Repo&s;e</HI> of <HI>Europe.</HI> This was the great End of the Con|gre&s;s it&s;elf: And, if this End were an&s;wer'd; the Mediating Powers were not &s;ollicitous about the Means u&s;ed in compa&s;&s;ing it; but could pa&s;s over the great Di&s;regard &s;hewn towards Them|&s;elves, in Con&s;ideration of the &s;olid and com|mon Good obtain'd by this Agreement.</P>
<P>But in how decent a Manner &s;oever, the Courts of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> treated this Af|fair: Tho&s;e of the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> &s;aw very well that &s;uch a Step could not but be very &s;hock|ing to the <HI>Mediators;</HI> and &s;tood in need of the be&s;t Apology They could make. And very luckily (as They or their <HI>Agents</HI> thought) for Them&s;elves, the Behaviour of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> in &s;ending back the <HI>Infanta</HI> to <HI>Spain;</HI> joined with his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty's not accept|ing the <HI>&s;ole Mediation</HI> at <HI>Cambray;</HI> furni&s;hed them with One as good as they could have wi&s;h'd. And therefore, the <HI>Imperial Mini&s;ters</HI> at <HI>Cambray,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> and at <HI>Paris,</HI> were very ready at fir&s;t to put it all upon this; and to declare that, the Rea&s;on of this extraordinary Step was, that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France</HI> having affronted his <HI>Catholick Maje&s;ty</HI> in &s;o high and &s;o unpardonable a Man|ner, that <HI>Spain</HI> could not in Honour any longer act with the <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King,</HI> as a <HI>Media|tor;</HI>

<P>But as <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Dates</HI> are &s;tubborn Things, not to be &s;haken by the Sound of Words and plau|&s;ible Speeches; this it&s;elf proved the mo&s;t unluc|ky Pretence po&s;&s;ible: and only opened a Door to the be&s;t-grounded Su&s;picions, that &s;omething very bad, too bad to be owned, was at the Bottom of &s;uch a Behaviour.</P>
<P>The Courts of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were not &s;o idle Spectators of the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> but that they had long before this the mo&s;t evi|dent Proofs in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that this Account of that Tran&s;action was impo&s;&s;ible to be true.

<P>But, if po&s;&s;ible, it was &s;till more unaccountable to draw an Excu&s;e from his <HI>Britannick Maje&s;ty</HI>'s not taking upon him&s;elf the <HI>&s;ole Mediation</HI> at <HI>Cambray:</HI> which it was well known he could not have done without an open Affront to <HI>France;</HI> and a manife&s;t Violation of the <HI>Quadruple Al|liance;</HI> be&s;ides other Inconveniencies.

<P N="1">1. On <HI>May</HI> 1. <HI>O.

<Q>That, after the &s;igning of the <HI>Vienna Treaty, Ripperda</HI> acquainted the <HI>Emperor</HI> that there remain'd &s;till &s;ome Things to regulate between the <HI>King</HI> his Ma&s;ter, and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that the <HI>King</HI> of

<P>To all this it was an&s;wer'd,
<Q>That, as for the <HI>Signing</HI> of the <HI>Treaty</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> it was no News here; his Maje&s;ty having Iready by a Courier received Advice of it: That, with Regard to the <HI>Guaranty</HI> mentioned, his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> could not con&s;ent to burthen him|&s;elf with new Obligations, by being <HI>Guaran|tee</HI> of the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> lately e&s;tabli&s;hed by the <HI>Emperor;</HI> but was re&s;olved to leave his Hands at Liberty, in order to have it in his Power to regard, and a&s;&s;i&s;t, his true Friends upon all Occa&s;ions that may ari&s;e; and that, as for what he had related as repre&s;ented by <HI>Ripperda</HI> to his <HI>Imperial Maje&s;ty,</HI> this Court knew of nothing <HI>Britain</HI> had to &s;ettle with <HI>Spain,</HI> but &s;ome Points of <HI>Commerce,</HI> for which there could be no need of a <HI>Mediator.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And certainly, no one can think but that it was wi&s;ely and happily judged, to refu&s;e a <HI>Guaranty,</HI> which might have been attended with &s;o fatal Con&s;equences. For, as the <HI>Em|peror</HI>'s Children are now <HI>Females</HI> only; and the Influence of that <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> upon <HI>Europe</HI> mu&s;t depend upon the <HI>Marriages</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Fe|males;</HI> and as no one <HI>then</HI> knew, to what <HI>Prin|ces</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="002880_0021_0FE685C41BC48D10">they might be hereafter married: It was wi&s;e in his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> not to oblige <HI>him&s;elf</HI> to <HI>&s;upport</HI> a <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> which might po&s;&s;ibly, by &s;ome fu|ture <HI>Marriages,</HI> become formidable to the re&s;t of <HI>Europe;</HI> and fatal in the End to <HI>Britain</HI> it &s;elf.

When the <HI>Treaty</HI> it&s;elf was read and exa|mined; and &s;uch <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> was &s;een to be e&s;|tabli&s;hed between <HI>&s;uch Powers,</HI> upon <HI>&s;uch Terms;</HI> the Con&s;ideration of this might ju&s;tly rai&s;e yet &s;tronger Su&s;picions.

Nothing was found in this <HI>Treaty of Peace,</HI> of Importance, or, &s;o much as in Appearance, Honourable to <HI>Spain:</HI> Nothing of the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> which had been &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on at the Congre&s;s: Nothing of the <HI>Titles</HI> to be u&s;ed by the&s;e <HI>Two Powers,</HI> but what might ea&s;ily have been &s;ettled <HI>there,</HI> much more to the Honour of <HI>Spain.</HI> And, if we come to Points of much more Importance; the <HI>Neutral Garri&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> which, by the <HI>Quadruple Alliance,</HI> were to be the great Bulwarks of the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> to <HI>Tu&s;cany;</HI> and every Thing the <HI>Mediators</HI> had propos'd for <HI>his</HI> Security, and that of the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> were all lo&s;t to <HI>Spain</HI> by this Pro|ceeding: Whil&s;t the <HI>Emperor</HI> gains every Thing, and particularly the <HI>Guaranty</HI> of his own <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;ion</HI> by <HI>Spain,</HI> which the <HI>Imperial</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dors had &s;ollicited in vain at the <HI>Congre&s;s.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3. Soon after the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> was &s;igned at <HI>Vienna,</HI> which was <HI>April</HI> 30. 1725. <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s In&s;olences towards his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> and even <HI>Threat|nings</HI> began; and from that Time continued, till it was thought more <HI>politick</HI> to be more <HI>&s;ilent.</HI> Of the&s;e, the Advices from <HI>Vienna</HI> were now perpetually full. Such, for In&s;tance, as the&s;e that follow, were his common Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P><Q><HI>If King</HI> George <HI>&s;upports</HI> France, we know <HI>very well how to place the Pretender upon the Throne.</HI> &mdash; Alberoni <HI>was a Great Man, but committed many Blunders: One great one was, That he &s;ent the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Fleet to</HI> Sicily, <HI>in&s;tead of Sending it to</HI> England, <HI>to dethrone the</HI> King; <HI>which might ea&s;ily then have been done: and this once done, the Way had been made plain for every Thing el&s;e.&mdash;King</HI> George <HI>had be&s;t con|&s;ider
<PB N="27" REF="002880_0026_0FE685E0DA690C20">how to come to Terms with us; for we have it in our Power to pu&s;h the</HI> Pretender's <HI>Intere&s;t with</HI> Efficacy.</Q> And in all his Di&s;|cour&s;es of this Sort, he always took it for grant|ed, that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vienna</HI> would never make the lea&s;t He&s;itation to enter into all the Mea|&s;ures of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>His Conver&s;ations of this peculiar Melignan|cy towards his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty, were with|out Number, and without Mea&s;ure. And &s;o far was he from &s;eeming to de&s;ire, they might be kept &s;ecret, that <HI>one</HI> of his Speeches to his Company was this: <HI>I know all that I &s;ay, is told again. I am very glad of it. I &s;ay what I &s;ay, on Purpo&s;e that</HI> it may be <HI>told.</HI> Nor did he &s;peak with much greater Re&s;pect of his <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI>'s Allies. Particularly, upon the Mention of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Hanover,</HI> between the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Great Britain, France</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> he &s;aid aloud, <HI>Yes, yes, We &s;hall teach the&s;e little Gen|tlemen (Petits Me&s;&s;ieurs) to make Treaties.</HI> And I will add here that, about this &s;ame Time, a very con&s;iderable Man in the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> was not much behind <HI>Ripperda</HI> him&s;elf in his Regards towards his <HI>Maje&s;ty;</HI> when, in a <HI>Con|ver&s;ation,</HI> upon a Per&s;on's expre&s;&s;ing his <HI>Doubt</HI> about his <HI>Britannick Maje&s;ty's undertaking</HI> to be Guarantee of the <HI>Au&s;trian Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> he an&s;wered with a great deal of Emotion. <HI>Then let him look to him&s;elf; for we are well inform'd they be|gin to be weary of him in</HI> England.</P>
<P>We may well think the&s;e and many more <HI>In|&s;ults</HI> and <HI>Threatnings,</HI> from Per&s;ons of &s;uch Fi|gure at that Time, &s;ufficient to create new <HI>Su|&s;picions,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="002880_0027_0FE6859BF1799A88">as well as to &s;trengthen Tho&s;e already created.

<P>4. The&s;e <HI>Su&s;picions</HI> were greatly confirm'd by the Accounts from <HI>Vienna</HI> of <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of another &s;ort, immediately after the &s;igning the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace: Expre&s;&s;ions,</HI> I mean, dropt &s;ometimes, as it were accidentally, upon &s;everal very important Points. He did not &s;cru|ple, in proper Places, and upon proper Occa|&s;ions, to declare in Conver&s;ation, <HI>that</HI> Spain was <HI>engaged to &s;upport the O&s;tend Company;</HI> and when that led the Di&s;cour&s;e to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>We know</HI> Gibraltar <HI>to be impragnable; but by the Mea&s;ures we have now taken here, we a&s;&s;ure Our &s;elves we &s;hall oblige</HI> England <HI>to give it up.</HI> At the &s;ame Time, he &s;pake of the <HI>Marriage of</HI> Don Carlos <HI>with the elde&s;t</HI> Archdutche&s;s, <HI>as a Thing</HI> agreed upon; and added, <HI>the</HI> Prince <HI>of</HI> A&s;turias, <HI>for whom this Match was fir&s;t de|&s;igned, is con&s;umptive, and can't live.</HI> And &s;ure|ly, &s;uch <HI>Expre&s;&s;ions</HI> mu&s;t amount to the <HI>&s;trong|e&s;t Su&s;picions</HI> of a <HI>Treaty,</HI> as yet <HI>Secret,</HI> of which the&s;e <HI>Three</HI> important Points mu&s;t make a Part.

<P>5. The&s;e Su&s;picions grew &s;tonger, upon the Appearance of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Commerce:</HI> which, tho' &s;igned at <HI>Vienna</HI> on the Day after the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> yet, was not <HI>communicated</HI> to the

The King's Mini&s;ter at <HI>Vienna</HI> procured a <HI>Copy</HI> of it, as &s;oon as it was printed there, and tran&s;mitted it to <HI>London.</HI> When this came to be read; and when it appeared in the plaine&s;t Light, that, by the Expre&s;s Words of it, &s;uch <HI>Altera|tions</HI> were made in the <HI>Commerce</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> at mu&s;t begin in the Ruine of our <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade, and end in that of all the other valuable Branches of our Commerce: What could the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> con|clude from &s;uch a <HI>Treaty,</HI> but that even This, bad as it is, is not all; that there mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing yet unknown to put in the <HI>Balance,</HI> on the Side of <HI>Spain,</HI> for all the&s;e unparalleled Ad|vantages given, again&s;t the expre&s;s Words of <HI>for|mer Treaties,</HI> to the <HI>Emperor</HI> and his <HI>Subjects;</HI> and that <HI>They,</HI> who were capable of entering into &s;uch <HI>Articles</HI> as the&s;e, which now appear'd, could not hope to &s;ucceed in them, without <HI>other Articles,</HI> and <HI>another Treaty,</HI> &s;till kept in Darkne&s;s, till the proper Time of producing it &s;hould come?</P>
<P>6. About the End of <HI>July,</HI> or the Beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the D&mdash; of <HI>Wh&mdash;n</HI> arrived at <HI>Vienna.</HI> The Court of <HI>London</HI> was not ignorant of his real Errand: nor of the Sum of Money he received, in his Journey, towards his Expen|ces, from the Pretender's Friends. And tho' he di&s;guis'd his De&s;ign a little, when he fir&s;t appear'd at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and pretended to his <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI>'s Friends there, that his View was only to
<PB N="30" REF="002880_0029_0FE6860EAF9B35C8">travel for a few Years, till the Memory of his Extravagancies at home might be a little effac'd, and his private Affairs in better order: yet, he quickly acted another Part in all his Con|ver&s;ation and Conduct. He &s;oon grew <HI>intimate</HI> with <HI>Ripperda,</HI> with whom he had frequent Conferences, and from whom he was known to receive Money. He was admitted to the <HI>Con|ver&s;ation</HI> of the <HI>principal Per&s;ons</HI> of the Court of <HI>Vienna.</HI> And during his whole Stay, both <HI>He</HI> and <HI>Graham,</HI> the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Agent at <HI>Vi|enna,</HI> had a very particular Intimacy with the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian Mini&s;ter</HI> at that Court. At fir&s;t the Project was, that He was to return to <HI>England,</HI> and do great Exploits there. But when he him|&s;elf began not to think <HI>England</HI> a very &s;afe Place for one who had laid him&s;elf open; the De&s;ign of his Return thither was laid a&s;ide; and another Plan was then concerted, of &s;ending him to <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pretender, and from thence to <HI>Spain.</HI> And before he parted from <HI>Vienna,</HI> his <HI>intimate</HI> and Fellow Labourer <HI>Graham,</HI> had long Conferences with a Per&s;on of great Importance at that <HI>Court:</HI> as he had <HI>afterwards</HI> &s;everal others. This <HI>Conduct</HI> of <HI>Wh&mdash;n</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> and of &s;o many con&s;iderable Per&s;ons whil&s;t he was there, &s;till increa&s;ed the Opinion, that the new <HI>Alliance</HI> could not be &s;o innocent a Thing as the <HI>publick Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P>7. The &s;mooth Language at <HI>Madrid</HI> was by this Time gradually abated, and at length quite changed. At the End of <HI>June</HI> 1725. the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> openly avowed the Acceptance of the <HI>Emperor's Mediation</HI> for the Re&s;titution of <HI>Gi|braltar;</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="002880_0030_0FE685941834B378">but at the &s;ame Time made the u&s;ual Profe&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip for the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and hoped that this <HI>Acceptance</HI> of that <HI>Mediation,</HI> would not offend him. Nor did this Court make any Scruple frankly now to own that the <HI>Affair</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> had been from the Begin|ning a principal Point, concerted between the <HI>Em|peror</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> In Con&s;equence of this, about the Middle of <HI>July</HI> following, M. <HI>Grimaldo,</HI> by order of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, wrote a Let|ter to his <HI>Britannick Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Mini&s;ter at <HI>Ma|drid;</HI> the Conclu&s;ion of which was very Pe|remptory: <Q>That the Continuance of the Alli|ance and Commerce of <HI>Great Britain</HI> with <HI>Spain,</HI> depended upon his Maje&s;ty's re&s;toring <HI>Gibraltar</HI> forthwith.</Q> And the Language of this Court, from this Time, was of an in&s;ul|ting Strain, with Regard even to the <HI>King</HI> him|&s;elf, who was then at <HI>Hanover;</HI> and in Words, not very civil, to this Effect, <Q><HI>Let him make ha&s;te home, and call his Parliament, and propo&s;e the</HI> Re&s;titution <HI>immediately.</HI></Q> This <HI>Alteration</HI> in the <HI>Language</HI> of the <HI>Court of Madrid;</HI> this de|manding <HI>Gibraltar</HI> in &s;o peremptory a <HI>Man|ner,</HI> which <HI>Britain</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es by <HI>Treaties</HI> &s;ign'd by this <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> him&s;elf, gave another ju&s;t Ground of Su&s;picion of a <HI>Secret Offen&s;ive Trea|ty,</HI> of a very pernicious Nature.</P>
<P>8. What confirm'd all the&s;e Su&s;picions very much, was, the <HI>Reception</HI> of <HI>Ripperda</HI> at <HI>Ma|drid;</HI> of the <HI>Man</HI> who had been the Maker of the <HI>Vienna Treaties,</HI> and who had u&s;ed <HI>his Maje&s;ty</HI> in &s;o in&s;olent and outragious a Man|ner. For, as <HI>before</HI> his coming thither, no Sati&s;|faction
<PB N="32" REF="002880_0031_0FE685F42B25B338">was ever given at <HI>Madrid,</HI> upon Com|plaint made of the&s;e <HI>Affronts</HI> and <HI>Threatnings:</HI> &s;o, <HI>after</HI> it, all <HI>Honours, Profits,</HI> and <HI>Tru&s;ts,</HI> were heap'd upon him, in a Degree hardly ever known.</P>
<P>And it was but rea&s;onable to conclude from hence, That, as the <HI>Court of Spain</HI> had veri|fied one Part of his Publick Di&s;cour&s;es at <HI>Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|na,</HI> by demanding <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> &s;o the aggrandi|zing and honouring him in &s;o extravagant a Manner, without &s;o much as the lea&s;t Di&s;a|vowal of his Behaviour, at <HI>Vienna,</HI> towards the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> was a &s;ort of Declaration, in Effect, that his whole Conduct, of which this was &s;o remarkable a Part, was not only not di&s;plea|&s;ing at <HI>Madrid;</HI> but perfectly agreeable to the <HI>main De&s;ign,</HI> and Tendency of the <HI>new Alliance,</HI> begun, conducted, and fini&s;h'd by this very Man at <HI>Vienna.</HI> And indeed, daring as <HI>Ripperda</HI> was, yet, it is hardly conceivable that he would have dared to have treated his <HI>Britannick Maje&s;ty,</HI> in that in&s;olent Manner; had he not known it to be agreeable to the <HI>Tenor</HI> of the <HI>New Al|liance;</HI> and been well a&s;&s;ured he &s;hould be &s;up|ported in it.</P>
<P>There were all <HI>Su&s;picions,</HI> or &s;omething &s;tron|ger than <HI>Su&s;picions,</HI> built upon <HI>Appearances</HI> that could have no Interpretation put upon them; and could have no <HI>Meaning,</HI> nor <HI>Con&s;i&s;tency</HI> in them; unle&s;s upon the <HI>Suppo&s;ition</HI> of <HI>another Treaty</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>that</HI> made publick to the World.

9. As there are Times and Sea&s;ons, when the Di&s;covery of Secrets may be thought to be of &s;uch &s;ingular U&s;e, as to countervail all the In|conveniencies of doing it: &s;o it happened in this Ca&s;e. <HI>Ripperda,</HI> now His <HI>Catholick Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Prime Mini&s;ter at <HI>Madrid,</HI> thought it of the highe&s;t Importance to u&s;e all Means to prevent the Acce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Hanover.</HI> And when he &s;aw that other Methods failed of this Effect upon the <HI>Dutch Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> there; he had recour&s;e to tho&s;e which he thought would terrify the <HI>States,</HI> in their pre&s;ent Situation, from all Thoughts of doing it. At the beginning there|fore of <HI>February,</HI> 1725-6. With the utmo&s;t Seri|ou&s;ne&s;s and Po&s;itivene&s;s, he a&s;&s;ured both the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ter at that Court, that there was a <HI>&s;ecret offen&s;ive Treaty</HI> between <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI> in which They had ob|liged them&s;elves mutually to &s;upport one another in their &s;everal Demands: And of this <HI>Treaty</HI> he told them <HI>three</HI> particular <HI>Articles.</HI> I. That the Emperor was to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> in the obtain|ing <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> II. That <HI>Spain</HI> was to &s;upport the Emperor in his new <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of the <HI>O&s;tend Company.</HI> III. And the <HI>Third</HI> was an <HI>Article,</HI> to &s;ettle the <HI>Quotas</HI> of <HI>Money</HI> on one Side, and <HI>Soldiers</HI> on the other, for the Purpo&s;es of this <HI>&s;ecret Treaty.</HI> This was to Influence the <HI>Dutch</HI> to judge that it would be in vain to en|deavour to alter or un&s;ettle that <HI>O&s;tend Trade,</HI> which was &s;o re&s;olved upon, and &s;o grounded.</P>
<P><HI>M. de Ripperda</HI> might have added another &s;ecret Engagement, into which the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Madrid</HI> had entered; <HI>viz.</HI> to under|take
<PB N="34" REF="002880_0033_0FE6859623EA03F8">the placing the Pretender on the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and to begin with that Enter|prize, before they proceeded to the Execution of their further Projects for involving all <HI>Europe</HI> in War and Confu&s;ion. Of this Engagement the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> received &s;uch certain Intelligence from &s;everal Quarters; that it is no more to be doubted, than The&s;e Particulars of the &s;ecret Offen&s;ive Alliance, avowed and de|clared by <HI>M. de Ripperda.</HI></P>
<P><HI>M. de Ripperda</HI>'s profe&s;s'd Di&s;covery of a &s;ecret <HI>Treaty,</HI> was &s;oon farther confirmed by what fol|lowed. An Account of this frank and open Di&s;covery was immediately &s;ent to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And, at the opening of the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of <HI>Parliament,</HI> A Noble Per&s;on in an high Station, agreeably to that Regard he owed to his Country, and to the Satisfaction due to that <HI>Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly,</HI> of which He was a Member, publickly declared it, in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lords,</HI> as an undoubted Truth, and what <HI>Rip|perda</HI> had own'd, That there was a &s;ecret <HI>Of|fen&s;ive</HI> Alliance between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> which contained <HI>Articles</HI> in it de&s;tructive of the Rights of <HI>Britain,</HI> both with Regard to its <HI>Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions</HI> and its <HI>Commerce</HI> abroad. This po&s;itive and undi&s;gui&s;ed Declaration in <HI>Parliament,</HI> made a great Noi&s;e without Doors. And, upon the Signification of this, to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> The <HI>Imperial Re&s;ident</HI> here was ordered to give Satisfaction to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court, upon this Subject. Accordingly, he came to &s;ome of His Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, and read out of a Paper the Words which he &s;aid were the Con|tents

<P>If from <HI>Vienna,</HI> we go back once again to <HI>Madrid,</HI> we &s;hall find &s;till more <HI>Evidences</HI> of a <HI>&s;ecret Treaty.</HI> For ju&s;t about the &s;ame time that <HI>Ripperda</HI> &s;pake &s;o openly to the two <HI>Am|ba&s;&s;adors,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> him&s;elf wrote a Letter to the <HI>States General</HI> for the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e of keeping them from acceeding to the Treaty of <HI>Hanover:</HI> which was read in the <HI>A&s;|&s;embly</HI> of the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland.

<Q>That His Catholick Maje&s;ty would look upon what|ever &s;hould be undertaken again&s;t the <HI>O&s;tend Company,</HI> as done again&s;t him&s;elf.</Q> This is an open owning of a Treaty, be&s;ides That already <HI>Publick;</HI> and of an <HI>Engagement</HI> in it to &s;upport the <HI>O&s;tend</HI> Company by Force.</P>
<P>To proceed; When about two Months after the fir&s;t Declaration made by <HI>Ripperda,</HI> it was repre&s;ented at <HI>Madrid</HI> how much the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was &s;urprized at this open Di&s;|covery, made to the <HI>Two Amba&s;&s;adors, of a &s;ecret Offen&s;ive Treaty:</HI> No other Reply could be obtained, but, in general Words, That the <HI>Court of Spain</HI> &s;till de&s;ired the Friend&s;hip of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that the Engagements en|ter'd into at <HI>Vienna,</HI> would not hinder this. Nor could any thing that was urged, move <HI>that Court,</HI> either to <HI>own</HI> this <HI>&s;ecret Treaty;</HI> or at all
<PB N="37" REF="002880_0036_0FE6859649739610">to <HI>deny</HI> it. Very &s;oon after this, the two <HI>Amba&s;&s;a|dors</HI> thought it proper to have a Conference with <HI>Ripperda;</HI> in which He began a little to &s;huffle, and to <HI>interpret away</HI> what he had &s;aid of an <HI>Of|fen&s;ive Treaty,</HI> by endeavouring to per&s;uade them, That it was little more than a <HI>Defen&s;ive One.</HI> But being pre&s;s'd by <HI>Both,</HI> who agreed in what He had before told them; and required peremp|torily to an&s;wer, whether he had not declared to Them expre&s;ly that there was a <HI>&s;ecret</HI> Offen|&s;ive Alliance between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>That he had told them &s;o;</HI> and ad|ded, <HI>that all he had told them was true.</HI> And how indeed could he po&s;&s;ibly deny it, &s;ince there was not a <HI>Foreigner</HI> of any Di&s;tinction at <HI>Madrid,</HI> who had not heard him, without Re&s;erve, de|clare the &s;ame about this <HI>&s;ecret Offen&s;ive Alliance?</HI> And whom can we believe in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; if not a Prime Mini&s;ter &s;o often affirming a matter of Fact to &s;o many; whil&s;t neither the <HI>King</HI> his <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> nor any of His other <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> at that time denied it; or at all look'd as if they had any Thoughts then of denying it?</P>
<P>And once more, when an Application was made at <HI>Madrid,</HI> from the <HI>Briti&s;h Court,</HI> with Re|lation particularly to the Part which <HI>Spain</HI> appear|ed now to take in the Affair of the <HI>O&s;tend Trade;</HI> at fir&s;t nothing was avowed, but an Obligation to u&s;e <HI>Good Offices</HI> for accomodating that Affair. But, when a <HI>Propo&s;al</HI> was offer'd, which the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> acknowledg'd to be a very <HI>rea|&s;onable</HI> one; and when upon this it was urg'd, That, &s;ince This Propo&s;al was thought a <HI>rea&s;ona|ble</HI> One; if the Imperial Court &s;hould refu&s;e to
<PB N="38" REF="002880_0037_0FE685F17A170860">li&s;ten to it; This could be a <HI>ju&s;t Rea&s;on</HI> why <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould not &s;upport the <HI>Emperor</HI> any farther in what <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf judg'd to be unrea&s;onable; It was an&s;wered, <Q>This could not be allowed: For <HI>Spain</HI> mu&s;t &s;tand by its <HI>Engagements</HI> with the Emperor.</Q> This was a plain Acknow|ledgment of farther <HI>Engagements,</HI> and of <HI>another</HI> Sort, than tho&s;e of a <HI>Friendly Accommodation;</HI> and by ju&s;t Con&s;equence, of a <HI>&s;ecret Offen&s;ive Trea|ty.</HI> For &s;uch Engagements mu&s;t be enter'd into by <HI>Treaty;</HI> and this <HI>Treaty</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;tinct from <HI>That</HI> already <HI>publi&s;hed,</HI> which does not contain them; and it mu&s;t be an <HI>Offen&s;ive</HI> Treaty, be|cau&s;e it is in &s;upport of an Inva&s;ion made upon the <HI>Rights</HI> of others; and in oppo&s;ition to Tho&s;e who act only in <HI>defen&s;e</HI> of tho&s;e Rights found|ed upon the mo&s;t &s;olemn Treaties.</P>
<P>After all this, it is too late for the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;ink the Credit of this <HI>Di&s;covery</HI> made by <HI>Ripperda</HI> to the two Amba&s;&s;adors; or to think of de&s;troying the Credibility of what this Court it &s;elf has given Te&s;timony to. All the <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> of this Affair, as I have related them, make it too plain to be <HI>now</HI> evaded: And all who know any thing of <HI>Publick Affairs,</HI> will look upon what I have now produced, as a po|&s;itive and convincing <HI>Evidence</HI> of what before was only a &s;trong <HI>Su&s;picion.</HI></P>
<P>This therefore, we are too &s;ure of; That the now publick <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> made at <HI>Vienna,</HI> was it &s;elf enter'd into without the lea&s;t Provo|cation from the <HI>Mediators;</HI> in contradiction to an <HI>Expre&s;s Article</HI> of the <HI>Quadruple Alliance,</HI> appointing this <HI>Mediation</HI> alone for the adju&s;t|ing

<P>We will now &s;ee what Light we can get in|to the Nature of This &s;o certain <HI>Offen&s;ive Alli|ance;</HI> and the other <HI>Treaties</HI> between the <HI>Em|peror</HI> and <HI>Spain:</HI> and in what manner <HI>We</HI> Our &s;elves are likely to be affected by <HI>Them;</HI> with regard to, the great and only Security of all our other good Things, the pre&s;ent <HI>Prote&s;tant Royal Family;</HI> with regard to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in <HI>Spain;</HI> with regard to the &s;ettled Rights and Privileges of the Nation in <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Commerce;</HI> and indeed, in con&s;equence of the&s;e, with regard to our being, or not being at all, a Nation worth exi&s;ting. If after this, we extend our View farther, We &s;hall &s;ee what is likely to be the Fate of Europe; and what will become

<P N="1">I. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Enquiry which will offer it &s;elf, upon this Occa&s;ion, to the Mind of every True <HI>Briton,</HI> will ari&s;e from the Intere&s;t We all have, in the pre&s;ervation of our pre&s;ent <HI>Prote&s;tant E&s;ta|bli&s;hment;</HI> and our <HI>concern</HI> to find out how <HI>This</HI> is already, or <HI>will</HI> probably be, affected by this <HI>New Alliance.</HI></P>
<P>I know very well how ea&s;y and how common it is, to laugh at the Name of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> when|ever it is mentioned upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions; as a Political <HI>Bugbear,</HI> or <HI>Scare-crow,;</HI> a mere Word of Alarm; or a Puppet to be play'd by <HI>State&s;men</HI> at their plea&s;ure, ond whenever their De&s;igns re|quire it. But it would be very unfortunate for <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and end in the total Ruine of <HI>Us</HI> and our <HI>Po&s;terity;</HI> if Tho&s;e who are at the Helm, &s;hould &s;uffer them&s;elves, at the Plea&s;ure of &s;uch as wi&s;h them no good, to be laugh'd out of that Care and Wakefulne&s;s which their <HI>King</HI> and their <HI>Country</HI> require of them. There is not a Day, nor an Hour, in which the nece&s;&s;ity of Attention to this great Point, does not appear: Nor is there, I fear, any <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of Affairs in <HI>Europe</HI> po&s;&s;i|ble, at this time, without <HI>This</HI> bearing a great part in it. And therefore, when a Breach with a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who loves his <HI>Subjects</HI> too hone&s;tly to give up their greate&s;t
<PB N="41" REF="002880_0040_0FE685A4FA9285A8">Concerns to the Demands of any Power upon Earth, is thought convenient and u&s;eful; no one can help concluding, from the known Princi|ples of the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Madrid,</HI> that the Moment They re&s;olved upon entring into an <HI>Alliance</HI> &s;o injurious to his <HI>Britannick Maje&s;ty,</HI> and &s;o de&s;tructive to the Interi&s;ts of <HI>Britain:</HI> The &s;ame Moment another Re&s;olution mu&s;t al&s;o be taken: The Re&s;olution of giving his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> all the unea&s;ine&s;s they could, even in his highe&s;t Rights; and either forcing Him by this Means to <HI>Their</HI> Terms; or prepairing the way for a <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> after their own Hearts, from whom they may expect all Submi&s;&s;ion and Com|pliance. But this is only a probable Argument. Let us come now to <HI>Facts.</HI></P>
<P>I have already mentioned &s;ome Preliminaries; the Journey of <HI>Wh&mdash;n</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and his Con|duct and Intrigues and Encouragements there; as well as <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s <HI>threatning King George</HI> with the <HI>Pretender,</HI> before he left <HI>Vienna.</HI> But afterwards the <HI>Appearances</HI> of a <HI>&s;ettled De&s;ign</HI> again&s;t His <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI> and His <HI>Royal Family,</HI> &s;oon began to thicken apace; and the <HI>Intelligences</HI> about it to be very po&s;itive, from all the Friends of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at almo&s;t every Court of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, according to what had been before concerted at <HI>Vienna,</HI> the D&mdash; of <HI>Wh&mdash;n,</HI> with Letters Recommendatory from young <HI>Rip|perda,</HI> went for <HI>Rome,</HI> directly to the <HI>Spani&s;h Mini&s;ter</HI> re&s;iding there. By this Mini&s;ter, he was introduced to the <HI>Pretender.</HI> In the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Hou&s;e, he was kept clo&s;e &s;hut up for <HI>Six Days;</HI> to hide, if po&s;&s;ible, his being there: And, after
<PB N="42" REF="002880_0041_0FE6859EC89B3388">very clo&s;e Conference, was po&s;ted away to <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> where old <HI>Ripperda,</HI> his great and intimate Friend, was now in high Credit and Honour.</P>
<P>Thither he came with <HI>Credentials</HI> from the <HI>Pre|tender;</HI> and, as a publick Mark of Confidence in him, adorn'd with a Garter, and a new Title; and was very kindly entertain'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> with the&s;e open Di&s;tinctions of Trea&s;on and Perjury upon him. And tho' it was often &s;aid, and pro|mi&s;ed and &s;worn to, by <HI>Ripperda,</HI> that this <HI>New Agent</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent away in <HI>twenty four Hours time;</HI> and as &s;trongly &s;worn to, that he never admitted him, nor ever would, into his Compa|ny; yet he &s;till remain'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> without any Mark of di&s;plea&s;ure, and was known to be fre|quently with <HI>Rpperda</HI> him&s;elf in clo&s;e Conference. His intimacy with Count <HI>Konig&s;ec,</HI> the <HI>Imperial</HI> Mini&s;ter at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and the freedom of his Vi|&s;its to him, were very remarkable, at a Time when he profe&s;s'd him&s;elf to come into <HI>Spain</HI> on no other Errand but the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Service; and this, without re&s;erve to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> them&s;elves at <HI>Madrid,</HI> who were in the Friend&s;hip, and even in the Service of the Crown of <HI>Britain.</HI> This made it certain, that the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e fre|quent Meetings with Per&s;ons of Character, both in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Imperial</HI> Service, could be no other, than that which brought him to <HI>Madrid.</HI> At the &s;ame Time the late Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was admitted to frequent <HI>Audiences</HI> at <HI>Court:</HI> In which no one could think that the Intere&s;ts of his Ma|&s;ter were forgot.

<P>What can the greate&s;t Well-wi&s;her to this <HI>New Alliance</HI> &s;ay, in Apology for this Conduct of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> as well the&s;e Audiences given now to the late Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> as the Recepti|on of the D&mdash; of <HI>Wh&mdash;n</HI> was favour'd with, at a Time when he came directly commi&s;&s;ion'd by the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and never attempted to hide the full intent of his Journey?

<P>In <HI>February</HI> 1725-6, a Re&s;olution was taken to &s;end a Body of Troops con&s;i&s;ting of 12000 Men, to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Galicia</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;cay.</HI> There were at that Time at <HI>Cadiz</HI> &s;everal <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships that were plainly de&s;igned for an Imbarkation: Two of them were of 70 Guns, one of 64, one of 56, one of 26, and one of 24; and all victuall'd for a hundred Days. And at <HI>Cadiz</HI> it <HI>now</HI> was, that 4800 Arms were known to have been bought, and de&s;tin'd to the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Service.

<P>As to the&s;e three Ships, the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &s;ome time after they &s;ailed from <HI>Peter&s;|bourg,</HI> made a full Di&s;covery, by Letters from the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Agent there, and others concerned in this Tran&s;action, which fell into their Hands; that they had been fitted out at the Expence of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Friends, with the Privity of the Court of <HI>Petersbourg,</HI> and &s;ent to <HI>Spain,</HI> to be em|ployed in an Expedition for the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Ser|vice; and that five more had been contracted for, and were de&s;ign'd to follow.

<P>From the mention of the&s;e particular Prepa|rations, I pa&s;s on to &s;hew what U&s;e was intend|ed to be made of the whole. So early as in <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> 1725-6, 12000 Men (as has been &s;aid a|bove) were de&s;ign'd to be &s;ent to the Coa&s;ts of
<PB N="47" REF="002880_0046_0FE685F44E561AE0"><HI>Galicia</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> the fir&s;t Project of the Court of <HI>Madrid</HI> being to make an Attempt on his Ma|je&s;ty's Dominions from tho&s;e Parts. But as &s;uch a Body of Troops could not at that Juncture march thither, without giving an Alarm; the Pretence for it, made u&s;e of by the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> was, that they had certain Intelligence of a Re|&s;olution taken by the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to land a Number of Troops in that part of the Country; who were to burn and de&s;troy all be|fore them, and even the Shipping in all the Harbours. Under the Cover of this pretended Intelligence, which no one in <HI>England</HI> could po&s;|&s;ibly give, and which no one at <HI>Madrid</HI> could re|ally believe, the March of the&s;e Forces was or|dered. But his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ter at <HI>Madrid,</HI> repre&s;enting to the Duke of <HI>Ripperda</HI> (who was then Prime Mini&s;ter, and in the highe&s;t Degree of Tru&s;t and Confidence with the King his Ma|&s;ter) that &s;uch Intelligence could have no Foun|dation; and even that &s;uch a De&s;ign from <HI>England</HI> was impo&s;&s;ible; <HI>Ripperda</HI> promi&s;ed the March of tho&s;e Troops &s;hould be forborn, till a Declarati|on from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court, to the Purpo&s;e of what Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI> had &s;aid, could be obtained.

<P>But the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> being &s;oon after per|fectly informed, that &s;uch vigorous Re&s;olutions were taken, and &s;uch Preparations and Di&s;po&s;i|tions made, by <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that it was in vain for them to hope for any Succe&s;s at that Time from &s;uch an Attempt; they &s;u&s;pended for the pre&s;ent the putting this De&s;ign in Execution; the rather, finding them&s;elves obliged to &s;end part of their Ships from <HI>Cadiz</HI> and St. <HI>Andero</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t|Indies:</HI> And the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Ships returned home.</P>

<P>This brings our Thoughts to the Court of <HI>Vi|enna;</HI> For <HI>This Article</HI> touches the <HI>Imperial Court,</HI> equal with <HI>That</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> and proves the <HI>Preten|der</HI>'s Cau&s;e, to be the Concern of the <HI>Former,</HI> as truly as of the <HI>Latter;</HI> and to be made &s;o by an expre&s;s <HI>Stipulation</HI> in a <HI>Treaty.</HI> And this alone is <HI>Evidence</HI> enough of the wor&s;t <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions</HI> towards a <HI>King,</HI> and a <HI>Nation,</HI> which have not de&s;erved

Hitherto, We have always &s;hewed our &s;elves &s;en&s;ible that <HI>Trade</HI> was our proper Life; and the Encouragement of this, upon an honourable Bottom, the proper Nouri&s;hment of that Life. Every In&s;tance of Conduct in any Power at Home, which has but &s;eem'd to &s;hake it a little, or to touch it, at a Di&s;tance, in an unkindly Manner, has been found to be &s;o re&s;ented, as to di&s;unite the grea|te&s;t Friends; and at once to unite tho&s;e of dif|ferent Views among&s;t us, in a vigorous Oppo&s;i|tion to it.

<P>The&s;e are not Words without a Meaning; nor Fears merely of Imagination &s;et on Work by pre|&s;ent Re&s;entment: But real, Sub&s;tantial, and un|deniable.

<P>So long ago as the Year 1609, the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> by the Truce then made with the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> granted them their fir&s;t Privileges of <HI>Trade</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> by which the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company has been from that time in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Commerce in tho&s;e Parts.

<P>And, before this, the ab&s;olute <HI>exclu&s;ion</HI> of all the Inhabitants of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> from all Trade or Commerce in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> was in the Year 1598 made an expre&s;s <HI>Article</HI> in the Act of <HI>Ce&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> by <HI>Philip</HI> II.

<P>To proceed; After the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> an Accident happened, which plainly &s;hewed, how the <HI>Fifth</HI> Article of that <HI>Treaty</HI> was under&s;tood, not only by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but by <HI>Spain</HI> al&s;o One <HI>Ba&s;tien Brower,</HI> a Subject of <HI>Spain,</HI> either of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">a|bant,</HI> or of <HI>Flanders,</HI> had obtain'd a <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to go to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>China</HI> where he carried on a very profitable Trade. When this came to the Knowledge of the <HI>High|Council</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company,</HI> they made a &s;olemn <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> immedi|ately, and &s;ent it as an Order to the Commanders
<PB N="60" REF="002880_0059_0FE685E6D9867C20">of all their Ships, and to all their Subjects, <HI>to take this Man Pri&s;oner;</HI> and if he defended him&s;elf, to u&s;e <HI>force</HI> again&s;t him. This had its Effect. The Man never appeared any more to give them far|ther Trouble. Other Subjects of <HI>Spain</HI> de&s;i&s;ted from all &s;uch Voyages. The Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> ne|ver complained of this Conduct; and by this Si|lence, plainly gave Te&s;timony to the Ju&s;tice of that <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> as founded upon the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Mun|&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1667, by a Treaty between <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> all Privileges of <HI>Commerce</HI> and <HI>Naviga|tion</HI> in both the <HI>Indies,</HI> were granted to his <HI>Britan|nick</HI> Maje&s;ty's Subjects, in as full and ample man|ner, as they were granted to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> And in the Year 1713, a Treaty of <HI>Commerce</HI> was concluded at <HI>Utrecht</HI> be|tween the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and this pre|&s;ent King of <HI>Spain:</HI> By the <HI>Fir&s;t Article</HI> of which it is declared, That, <Q>the Treaty of Peace, Commerce, and Alliance concluded at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in 1667, is ratified and confirmed by this Trea|ty;</Q> and it is added, that, for the greater <Q>Strengthening and Confirmation of the &s;ame, it has been thought proper to in&s;ert it Word for Word in this Place.</Q> Then follows that former Treaty thus ratified and confirmed.</P>
<P>In the Year 1724, but one Year before this <HI>New Alliance</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> this &s;ame King of <HI>Spain</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his <HI>Obligations,</HI> lying upon him from the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> alone, that he pre|&s;ented, by his Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>London,</HI> a Memorial again&s;t the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Attempts upon <HI>Trade</HI> from <HI>O&s;tend;</HI> in which he in&s;i&s;ted, that the A&s;&s;air of

<Q>without re|&s;erving expre&s;ly to it &s;elf the exclu&s;ive Right on the Navigation to the <HI>Indies,</HI> in general, and without Exception; the <HI>States-General</HI> would be rightly entitled to demand Satisfaction of <HI>Spain,</HI> for having thereby made a great Infra|ction of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> and would be di&s;engaged from the reciprocal Obligation to ab&s;tain from the Navigation of the <HI>Spani&s;h In|dies.</HI></Q> That is, in other Words, that if he, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;hould not &s;upport the <HI>Dutch</HI> (and con&s;equently the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> al&s;o) again&s;t the <HI>Empe|ror</HI>'s new E&s;tabli&s;hment at <HI>O&s;tend; that then,</HI> I &s;ay, he him&s;elf &s;hould be ju&s;tly charged with a mo&s;t <HI>di&s;honourable Breach</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> and Violation of &s;olemn Treaties. Thus &s;tands the Engage|ments of <HI>Spain,</HI> with regard to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> in the Affair of their <HI>Trade</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s new Attempts at <HI>O&s;tend.</HI> Let us now con&s;ider the <HI>Obligations</HI> and Engagements of the <HI>Emperor</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> 1701, between the <HI>Emperor Leopold,</HI> King <HI>William,</HI> and the <HI>States-General,</HI> is built upon this very Fountation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade to the <HI>Indies,</HI> as upon a <HI>main Ground</HI> of that Alliance. It opens it&s;elf with re|citing, that upon the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> without I&s;&s;ue, the <HI>Emperor</HI> claimed the Right of Succe&s;&s;ion to his Countries, as belong|ing
<PB N="62" REF="002880_0061_0FE6858AD57E6930">to the <HI>Au&s;trian Family;</HI> and, after other Par|ticulars, it follows,
<Q>&s;o that without &s;ome Re|medy applied, the <HI>Emperor</HI> will lo&s;e his Pre|ten&s;ions; the Empire lo&s;e its <HI>Fiefs</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> and the ENGLISH and UNITED PROVIN|CES be deprived of the <HI>free U&s;e</HI> of their NA|VIGATION and COMMERCE in the IN|DIES, and other Places,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it appears, 1. That the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Fami|ly claiming by <HI>Hereditary Right</HI> the&s;e <HI>Provinces,</HI> could not <HI>rightfully</HI> claim any <HI>Powers,</HI> but what were ve&s;ted and remained in <HI>Charles</HI> II. the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to whom they were to &s;ucceed; nor po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>them,</HI> but upon the <HI>Conditions,</HI> upon which the decea&s;ed King him&s;elf had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them: And that the Emperor neither could, nor did, claim any thing that his Predece&s;&s;ors, Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> had parted with by &s;olemn Treaties; and therefore neither could, nor did, claim tho&s;e Coun|tries, but upon the &s;ome Terms and Contitions of Trade, on which King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>Spain</HI> had en|joyed them, agreeably to &s;olemn Treaties with other Powers. 2. That the Pre&s;ervation of the Trade in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> up|on the Foot they enjoyed it, and in the Manner it was carried on, to the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>Spain,</HI> was one ground, and a main one, of the <HI>Grand Alliance;</HI> and that the Emperor's Preten&s;ions to the Low-Countries were &s;upport|ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> upon this, among&s;t other Conditions, that the Emperor &s;hould reci|precally &s;upport their Trade to the <HI>Indies,</HI> on the Foot they had con&s;tantly enjoyed it. 3. It hav|ing been already proved, that <HI>Holland</HI> ever &s;ince
<PB N="63" REF="002880_0062_0FE685C830F95A80">the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> in 1648, and <HI>England</HI> ever &s;ince the Treaty of <HI>Madrid</HI> in 1667, have carried on their Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> to the Exclu&s;ion of the Subjects of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> by Virtue of tho&s;e Treaties; it follows, That, in con&s;equence of this, and by Virtue of this <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> it &s;elf (by which the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Claim to the&s;e Countries is allowed, and the <HI>Claim</HI> of the Allies to their <HI>Commerce</HI> al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted on) the Emperor did in Ef|fect oblige him&s;elf and his <HI>Family,</HI> whenever in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e <HI>Countries,</HI> to take upon them|&s;elves all the Obligations which the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> to whom they &s;ucceeded, were under, to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> by former <HI>Treaties;</HI> and to &s;upport this <HI>main End</HI> of the <HI>grand Alliance,</HI> relating to the Commerce of the Allies, (expre&s;sly mention|ed in it,) as well as <HI>their own</HI> Preten&s;ions: and, in&s;tead of invading them them&s;elves, to defend them again&s;t all <HI>Invaders,</HI> according to the Obli|gations of tho&s;e <HI>former Treaties.</HI> Nay, it was like|wi&s;e expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, in this <HI>grand Alliance,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing it to end &s;ucce&s;sfully; That the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI> &s;hould be (not the <HI>Property</HI> of the <HI>Em|peror</HI> ab&s;olutely, and without any Conditions; but) a Barrier to the <HI>United Provinces.</HI> So that we &s;ee, the <HI>Emperor,</HI> in the <HI>grand Alliance</HI> it&s;elf, con&s;idered his own Right to the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> with a View to the Trade of his <HI>Allies;</HI> and that the <HI>Spani&s;h Low-Countries</HI> were e&s;tabli&s;hed in that <HI>Al|liance,</HI> as a <HI>Defence</HI> and <HI>Guard</HI> to tho&s;e <HI>Allies,</HI> who&s;e Trade is now going to be ruined from them.</P>
<P>But the&s;e <HI>Obligations</HI> are not only the real In|tent and <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> of the <HI>grand Alliance:</HI> But it is declared in expre&s;s Words, in the Barrier <HI>Treaty</HI>

<P>And the part which <HI>Spain</HI> has acted, with re|gard to <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> and the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more extraordinary; and more out of the <HI>common Road</HI> of dealing with <HI>Treaties</HI> and <HI>Alliances.</HI> For thus it is, &mdash; That <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> who enjoys his Kingdom under the <HI>Stipulations</HI> of the <HI>Treaties</HI> made by his <HI>Predece&s;&s;ors:</HI> &mdash; who has confirmed them all <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> in his own Per&s;on:&mdash; <HI>He,</HI> who in <HI>one</HI> Year declared it would be a Breach of his Treaties, for Him ever to acquie&s;ce in the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>O&s;tend Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company: That &s;ame King, the next Year, does much more than this. He undertakes, by this <HI>new Alliance,</HI> to <HI>&s;upport</HI> the <HI>Emperor</HI> in this very E&s;tabli&s;hment. Not only this; but he grants to the&s;e very <HI>O&s;ten|ders,</HI> and all other Subjects of the <HI>Emperor</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> what he had no Right to grant to them, had they remained his own Subjects; nay, he grants them <HI>Privileges</HI> of his <HI>Ports</HI> and Places in the <HI>Indies,</HI> greater than are allowed to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> them&s;elves: And this, not only with re&s;pect to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> but the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> al&s;o. For by the 2d and 3d Articles of the <HI>Vienna Treaty</HI> of <HI>Commerce,</HI> a Liberty is granted to them, to frequent, and Trade in, the Ports of the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies;</HI> Or, &s;uppo&s;ing this not directly granted, in expre&s;s Words, yet they are at lea&s;t permitted to <HI>enter</HI> into tho&s;e Ports for victualling or repairing their Ships: which will come to the &s;ame Thing. For if they may

<P>I am &s;en&s;ible it may be objected here, that the Liberty granted to the Emperor's Subjects, by the Treaty of <HI>Vienna,</HI> to enter into the Ports of <HI>Spain</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in ca&s;e of Di&s;tre&s;s of Weather, or for refre&s;hing them&s;elves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is no more than what was formerly granted to his Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects by the Treaty of <HI>Madrid,</HI> concluded in 1670. But it is well known, that the Liberty granted by that Treaty, has cea&s;ed for many Years; and that, in order to prevent the Abu&s;es that might be committed from &s;uch a permi&s;&s;ion, and that one Nation might not be more favoured than a|nother on any Pretext what&s;oever in the Trade to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;ufficient Care was taken of that Matter in the 8th Article of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> by which it is expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, and declared in the following Words: <HI>Whereas among other Conditions of the general Peace, it is by common Con&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed, as a chief and fundamental Rule, that the Exerci&s;e of Navigation and Commerce to the</HI> Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies, <HI>&s;hould remain in the &s;ame State it was in the Time of King</HI> Charles II. <HI>of</HI> Spain, <HI>and that therefore this Rule may hereafter be ob&s;erved with inviolable Faith, and in a Manner never to be broken, and thereby all Cau&s;es of Di&s;tru&s;t and Su&s;picion con|cerning that Matter may be prevented and removed; it is e&s;pecially agreed and concluded, that no Licen&s;e, or any Permi&s;&s;ion at all, &s;hall at any Time be given to the</HI> French, <HI>or any other Nation whatever, in any Name, or under any Pretence, directly; or indirectly, to</HI> SAIL,

And the <HI>&s;ame Condition</HI> is likewi&s;e &s;tipulated in the 34th Article of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> between the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the States.

<P>On the other Side, I cannot help entirely dif|fering from all this.

<P>For in the fir&s;t Place, They who argue again&s;t it, from this Con&s;ideration, leave out a <HI>main Point;</HI> and a Point which comprehends all other Evils in it and that is, the <HI>continued Attempts</HI> of put|ting the <HI>Pretender</HI> upon us: Which mu&s;t &s;ucceed, unle&s;s we &s;hew our &s;elves determined to oppo&s;e any Power engaged in Support of &s;uch De&s;igns.

<PB N="80" REF="002880_0079_0FE6867B756B6A40">all <HI>Europe</HI> in general, is extremely concern'd: I mean the <HI>Marriages</HI> agreed upon, between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> which, added to the <HI>compre|hen&s;ive</HI> and <HI>extended Trade</HI> now likely to be tran&s;|planted into the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> mu&s;t con&s;titute a Power in <HI>one Family</HI> beyond all that we have known, Formidable and Irri&s;i&s;tible. The <HI>Mar|riages</HI> I &s;peak of, are <HI>tho&s;e</HI> of the two <HI>Arch Dutch|e&s;&s;es, Daughters</HI> to the pre&s;ent <HI>Emperor,</HI> with the two <HI>Infants</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> Sons to the <HI>King</HI> by his pre|&s;ent <HI>Queen.</HI> And that the&s;e are agreed upon, as a main and e&s;&s;ential Point in this <HI>New Alliance,</HI> We have the following Proofs.</P>
<P N="2">1. Immediately after the Signing the <HI>Publick Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> at <HI>Vienna, Ripperda</HI> very freely talk'd of the <HI>Marriage</HI> of <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> the <HI>elde&s;t</HI> Son of the pre&s;ent Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> with the <HI>elde&s;t Arch Dutche&s;s,</HI> as a fixt Matter; and that the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>A&s;turias</HI> was di&s;regarded in this <HI>Alliance,</HI> becau&s;e of his ill Health, as he pretended at that Time: and a little while after, he &s;pake as open|ly and po&s;itively about the <HI>Marriages,</HI> both of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> and his <HI>Brother.</HI> One of his Conver|&s;ations was very Remarkable, and full of &s;uch <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> as will not let Us doubt of the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Subject of it.
<Q>The King's <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation, (<HI>&s;ays He</HI>) are bitter again&s;t me: but I laugh at all that. The <HI>Queen</HI> will protect me. I have done <HI>her</HI> &s;uch Services that <HI>&s;he</HI> can't abandon me: for thus the Matter &s;tands. The <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> of the <HI>Imperial Court</HI> were of a <HI>Marriage</HI> with the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>A&s;turias,</HI> and my fir&s;t <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> from <HI>Spain</HI> were for the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>A&s;turias;</HI> but it was I,
<PB N="81" REF="002880_0080_0FE6865DCD7F17E8">who got that De&s;tination chang'd. I wrote to the <HI>Queen</HI> to engage the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>A&s;turias,</HI> with|out Delay, to a Daughter of <HI>Portugal,</HI> that he might not &s;tand in the Way of <HI>Don Carlos:</HI> And it was I that found the Way of turning all this Affair to the Advantage of her <HI>two Sons.</HI> And do you think I have much to Fear after &s;uch Services?</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. This agrees exactly with the Language of the Court of <HI>Madrid:</HI> Where, after the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> was known to be Sign'd at <HI>Vienna,</HI> this Al|liance with the <HI>Emperor</HI> was freely &s;poke of, as the <HI>Queen</HI>'s own <HI>Tran&s;action</HI> entirely; enter'd into, and conducted by <HI>her&s;elf;</HI> and the <HI>Marriage</HI> of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> &s;poke of, at fir&s;t, without re&s;erve or Appearance of Secrecy, as a Matter agreed upon. Nor did any <HI>one</HI> Per&s;on, who frequented the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> make the lea&s;t Doubt of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. This will help us to Account for other Parts of the <HI>Conduct</HI> of <HI>Spain:</HI> which, without this, will be wholly unaccountable, and out of the Road of all Policy. For in&s;tance, Suppo&s;e only the&s;e <HI>Marriages,</HI> or That alone of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> with the <HI>elde&s;t Arch Dutche&s;s;</HI> and this will &s;hew us, Why that Court could be brought to di&s;card the <HI>Neutral Garri&s;ons,</HI> and all other <HI>Securities</HI> furni&s;h'd by the <HI>Quadruple</HI> Alliance for the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hing</HI> her Son, the &s;ame <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> and to tru&s;t to the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s naked Word in &s;o great a Point: <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e by this <HI>Marriage</HI> it would come about, that the <HI>Emperor,</HI> by &s;ecuring tho&s;e <HI>Dominions</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> for <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> would &s;ecure them, at the &s;ame Time, for the <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI> of his own <HI>Daughter;</HI> and &s;o mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity, for the Sake of his
<PB N="82" REF="002880_0081_0FE68668DEA63CB8">own Intere&s;t, and the aggrandizing his own Fa|mily, be &s;incere and zealous in this Affair. On the other Side, the &s;ame Suppo&s;ition of this <HI>Mar|riage</HI> gives a rea&s;onable Solution, Why the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> has con&s;ented to, what the <HI>Spani&s;h Mini|&s;ters</HI> at the <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> would not hear of, the <HI>Guaran|ty</HI> of the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> as lately e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria: viz.</HI> Becau&s;e it comes about by this Marriage, that being <HI>Guarantee</HI> to the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> in his <HI>Au&s;trian Dominions,</HI> is no more than being <HI>Guarantee</HI> for the Queen's own Son <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> the future Husband of the <HI>elde&s;t Arch Dutche&s;s;</HI> and that <HI>Self Intere&s;t</HI> mu&s;t make <HI>Spain,</HI> under its pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, &s;in|cere in this <HI>Guaranty.</HI> And upon any other Bot|tom, we may &s;afely defy the World to give a So|lution of <HI>the&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;everal</HI> other Appearances, in this New Alliance.</P>
<P>I need not go farther, and appeal to any Words that may have been dropp'd in Confidence, at the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> it&s;elf, upon the Subject of the&s;e Marriages; and that, with a particular Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction expre&s;s'd in them, Since we have &s;o much, and &s;o &s;trong, Evidence of the Reality of it, from the Mouth of <HI>Ripperda,</HI> who made the Treaty; and from the Language of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> it&s;elf; as well as from the utter In|con&s;i&s;tency and Unaccountablene&s;s of the proceed|ings of that Court, without this Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I acknowledge indeed, That at <HI>Vienna,</HI> when it began to appear that what had been &s;aid upon this Head had allarm'd <HI>Europe;</HI> and when, in par|ticular, the great Aim was to keep the <HI>Dutch</HI> from acceding to the Treaty of <HI>Hanover;</HI> which
<PB N="83" REF="002880_0082_0FE6865965B76158">might be ha&s;ten'd by &s;o terrible an Appearance: Then, the whole Affair of the&s;e <HI>Marriages</HI> was utterly di&s;own'd; nay, in Order to deny the&s;e <HI>Marriages,</HI> it was ab&s;olutely denied that there was any &s;uch Thing in Being, as a <HI>&s;ecret Treaty</HI> be|tween the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I am not afraid of relating <HI>this,</HI> after all the Proofs before given of the <HI>Reality</HI> of a <HI>&s;ecret Treaty,</HI> and of this <HI>Article</HI> in it; nor at all unwilling that it &s;hould work as much as it can, and have all the Weight it ought to have: For I am confident, that, as this Conduct convinced not one Per&s;on at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and made not the lea&s;t <HI>Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ter, or his <HI>Ma&s;ters;</HI> &s;o it will make no Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon Any who have read what I have before laid down, unle&s;s it be this, That they who can act an unju&s;tifiable part, can, without Scruple, and with the &s;ame Ea&s;e, bring them|&s;elves to a peremptory and ab&s;olute Denial of it, till the proper Time comes for their open Avowal of it.</P>
<P>But as this <HI>Article</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Marriages</HI> mu&s;t re|main undoubted; we cannot help &s;pending a few Thoughts upon the <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of them, or of the fir&s;t of <HI>them</HI> only. There is but <HI>one</HI> Life, that of the Prince of <HI>A&s;turias,</HI> between <HI>Don Carlos</HI> and the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> after the Death of the pre&s;ent <HI>King.</HI> There is only the &s;ame Life between <HI>Don Carlos</HI> and the Crown of <HI>France;</HI> &s;hould the pre|&s;ent King there dye without <HI>I&s;&s;ue Male;</HI> and the <HI>Renunciations</HI> not take place: both which Events may happen.</P>
<P>And as to the va&s;t Hereditary Dominions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria, Don Carlos</HI> will come to them
<PB N="84" REF="002880_0083_0FE68653584C2760">by Right of his Wife. And as Experience has &s;hewn us, for many Ages, that whoever is Ma&s;ter of the&s;e Dominions, and the Power that attends them, has been, and mu&s;t be <HI>Emperor,</HI> notwith&s;tanding its be|ing an Elective Crown: <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> by marrying the <HI>elde&s;t Arch Dutche&s;s,</HI> cannot &s;ail of being <HI>Empe|ror.</HI> So that <HI>Don Carlos</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly be at once, <HI>Emperor,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and King of <HI>Spain:</HI> and have the va&s;t Strength and Riches of all the&s;e Powers united and center'd in him.</P>
<P>I have thus &s;ufficiently &s;hewn the many and complicated <HI>Evils</HI> of this <HI>New Alliance</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> and the ju&s;t <HI>Apprehen&s;ions,</HI> and well-grounded <HI>Fears,</HI> which the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> could not but entertain, from all Ap|pearances and all Advices, about the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Tendency</HI> of it, with Regard to the pre&s;ent <HI>E&s;tab|li&s;hment</HI> of the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> to our <HI>Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions;</HI> our <HI>Commerce;</HI> our <HI>Religion;</HI> our <HI>Liberties,</HI> and tho&s;e of all <HI>Europe;</HI> and, in a Word, to every <HI>Thing</HI> that ought to be Dear to Us. And now, Let any Per&s;ons among&s;t us, who know how to prize the&s;e <HI>ine&s;timable Goods,</HI> which alone make <HI>Life</HI> it&s;elf valuable, &s;urvey this <HI>New Alliance</HI> in e|very Part of it: and judge, <Q>Whether ever hi|therto <HI>any one Scheme</HI> has appear'd in <HI>Europe,</HI> of a De&s;truction &s;o univer&s;al, and of a Ruine &s;o extended, as <HI>This</HI> (taking the whole together) appears plainly to be.</Q></P>
<P>It is time now for us to enquire, What has been the Conduct of the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> upon the View of all the&s;e Evils.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t &s;tep they took was to renew, by a Treaty, the Defen&s;ive Engagements &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="85" REF="002880_0084_0FE6866772235B90">between <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia.</HI> But this Treaty was not &s;et on foot till &s;ome Months after the <HI>New Alliance</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> and after the be&s;t Intelligences, and mo&s;t mature Con&s;ideration, of the <HI>Tendency</HI> of that <HI>Al|liance.</HI> And as this <HI>Treaty,</HI> made at <HI>Hanover,</HI> has long been publick in the World; I need not ob|&s;erve that it is a <HI>Treaty</HI> entirely <HI>Defen&s;ive</HI> between <HI>Britain, France</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> for the mutual &s;upport of each other, again&s;t Injuries; and not at all for the invading, or injuring, any Nation under Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. Particular Regard was &s;hewn to the <HI>States General,</HI> in the framing of the Treaty of <HI>Hanover:</HI> to which they have &s;ince acceded. The next care was to invite the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> into this Al|liance; that Kingdom having &s;o often and &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully appeared in Defence of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and of the Liberties of Europe. And the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el,</HI> who&s;e Family has done &s;uch &s;ignal Service to the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e, readily offer'd a good Body of Troops, in &s;up|port of this Alliance.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Steps which the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> thought fit to take as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, af|ter the Danger we were in, appeared evident be|yond all contradiction.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> found their Country immediately threatn'd in its great|e&s;t Concerns from the&s;e Treaties of <HI>Vienna;</HI> Both Hou&s;es gave his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> all <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of &s;upport in whatever He &s;hould think fit to do in the pre&s;ent critical Conjuncture. And accordingly it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary now to con&s;ider in earne&s;t, what was mo&s;t proper to be done. The Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="002880_0085_0FE68681861D0870">had evident Proof that nothing could influence the Two <HI>New Allies</HI> to Terms of Rea&s;on, but to &s;hew a <HI>vigorous Spirit</HI> again&s;t every pernicious or &s;u&s;picious part of &s;uch an Alliance. And as all Appearances, in all parts, convinced them, That nothing could &s;o effectually guard again&s;t ap|proaching Evils, as the di&s;patching &s;ufficient <HI>Squadrons</HI> of <HI>Ships</HI> to &s;everal Places; and as they were &s;en&s;ible that our <HI>Fleet,</HI> now the be&s;t in the World, could never be of any Account, either towards our <HI>Glory</HI> or our <HI>Safety,</HI> but upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; They did, with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence, fit out <HI>Three Squadrons</HI> of <HI>Men of War:</HI> One for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> One for the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain,</HI> and One for the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P>It will now be ask'd, as it has been indeed al|ready, What beneficial <HI>Effect</HI> has this <HI>Method</HI> had? What Good have we gain'd, or what Evil have we prevented, by the&s;e Grand Appearances of our <HI>Fleets</HI> abroad? And if an An&s;wer may be rea&s;onably expected, by Tho&s;e who ask the&s;e and the like <HI>Que&s;tions;</HI> &s;o is it al&s;o a ju&s;t Expectation, That, They &s;hould be as ready to receive a Rea|&s;onable An&s;wer to them, as they are to ask them.</P>
<P>As to the Treaty of <HI>Hanover;</HI> I will &s;uppo&s;e, no <HI>Apology</HI> can be expected for <HI>That,</HI> after &s;uch a &s;urprizing and formidable Conjunction of the <HI>Two Powers</HI> of the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> the De&s;ign, and the <HI>Articles</HI> of which <HI>Conjunction</HI> appear'd every Day more and more terrible to their <HI>Neighbours.</HI> The Contracting Parties in the <HI>Hanover</HI> Treaty mu&s;t have been taxed with <HI>Infatuation</HI> and <HI>In&s;en&s;i|bility,</HI> beyond the common Pitch of <HI>Tho&s;e Evils,</HI> if They had not enter'd into a <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>hearty</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="002880_0086_0FE6868EACD16768">Concert for their own <HI>Self-Defence,</HI> in &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances, of pre&s;ent Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Trade</HI> of <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them; and of Forebodings of <HI>future</HI> Evil to them All.</P>
<P>But as the Que&s;tion here at home, chiefly, if not &s;olely, refers to our Naval <HI>Armaments</HI> from <HI>England;</HI> What have They produced, or, for what Rea&s;ons were they &s;ent? The An&s;wer is very plain. As to the Squadron &s;ent to the <HI>We&s;t|Indies;</HI> I believe there is no one who has an E&s;tate in tho&s;e Parts, or is concern'd in any Trade thi|ther, who did not think it highly nece&s;&s;ary to have a Strong Squadron in tho&s;e Seas, for &s;ecur|ing our Commerce; which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been inevitably ruined, by the Depredations and Violences committed by the Spaniards for &s;everal Years pa&s;t without Redre&s;s. And if the &s;ending of the &s;aid Squadron has prevented the Return of the Galleons: no Man who is in the lea&s;t conver|&s;ant in the Affairs of Europe, can make any doubt but that this Incident has been the only Thing that has hitherto prevented a War in Europe, by depriving the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Madrid</HI> of the means of putting in execution the dangerous Schemes they had projected.</P>

In &s;ome of the <HI>Pretences</HI> and <HI>Demands</HI> of this <HI>new Alliance,</HI> no Equivalent, no Accommodation, could be propo&s;ed. In the <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> of the Demand of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Nation</HI> &s;eems univer&s;ally to concur, that no Sum of Money, nor any o|ther Place of Strength abroad, can be any <HI>Equi|valent</HI> to it: what could be propo&s;ed, but a <HI>Re|&s;olution</HI> to defend the <HI>Nation</HI> in its ju&s;t <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of it; e&s;pecially, &s;ince the whole pre&s;ent Conduct of <HI>Spain</HI> may a&s;&s;ure us, by a fre&s;h Evidence, that it is of the utmo&s;t Importance; and that, if that Place were once gone out of our Hands, we &s;hould have &s;till le&s;s Hope of &s;eeing Treaties ob|&s;erv'd, or of hindering our&s;elves from being more and more injured, on that &s;ide, in our <HI>Commerce?</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="002880_0098_0FE68685A54E04B0">3. In the <HI>other</HI> great Ca&s;e, that of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s new E&s;tabli&s;hment at <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> never went upon &s;uch an arbitrary Maxim as, That <HI>other Nations</HI> ought not to be permitted to begin and extend their <HI>Commerce</HI> wherever they <HI>rightfully</HI> could, as well as <HI>our&s;elves;</HI> or that <HI>we</HI> had any Right to oppo&s;e &s;uch Attempts: But upon the&s;e undoubted Maxims of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Right,</HI>&mdash; That <HI>Treaties</HI> are to be ob&s;erved; &mdash; That, when any Country is excluded by Treaties from any particu|lar Branch of Commerce, it is not to be authori|zed and &s;upported in carrying on the &s;aid Bran|ches of Commerce in violation of the &s;aid Treaties; and &mdash; That <HI>tho&s;e Powers</HI> which have, by repeated <HI>Engagements,</HI> obliged them&s;elves to defend and &s;upport the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade, are ju&s;tly to be oppo&s;ed when they them&s;elves come to be the <HI>Invaders</HI> and <HI>De&s;troyers</HI> of it. Agreeably to all this, 4. As the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has taken &s;uch <HI>vi|gorous Mea&s;ures</HI> as &s;hew the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> of <HI>Self-defence:</HI> &s;o, has it never been wanting either to propo&s;e, or to receive, any rea&s;onable Method for the Ac|commodation of this Matter, to the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Satis|faction; if He could be &s;atisfied with any thing, but a <HI>Trade</HI> in open Contradiction to all Treaties.</P>
<P>In particular, It was &s;ufficiently intimated to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> that the <HI>Briti&s;h Court</HI> pre|tended to nothing in this Affair, but to defend the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI> belonging to <HI>Britain</HI> by <HI>Trea|ties;</HI> far from a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves any Right of controlling the <HI>Emperor,</HI> or his Subjects, in any Attempts, not contrary to tho&s;e Treaties: That therefore, if the <HI>Emperor</HI> would remove this <HI>Com|pany,</HI> and the Seat of <HI>Trade,</HI> now at <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> to <HI>Trie&s;te,</HI> or any other Place in his <HI>Dominions,</HI> which
<PB N="100" REF="002880_0099_0FE686816471F4C0">did not heretofore belong to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monar|chy; <HI>Britain</HI> was ready quietly to acquie&s;ce. And the &s;ame was offer'd to the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> in the form of a <HI>Propo&s;al,</HI> when his <HI>Catholick Maje&s;ty</HI> had ju&s;t begun to e&s;pou&s;e the <HI>Emperor's Intere&s;t,</HI> in this Affair of <HI>O&s;tend.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> not only acknow|ledged the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the <HI>Propo&s;al;</HI> but made great Profe&s;&s;ions of Hope that it would be accepted; yet, at the &s;ame Time, it was de|clared, That <HI>Spain</HI> was under Engagements to &s;tand by the <HI>Emperor,</HI> even &s;uppo&s;ing his <HI>unrea|&s;onable</HI> Refu&s;al of it. And at <HI>Kienna,</HI> the Intima|tion made no <HI>Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> at all: The Re&s;olution there, by this appearing plainly to be, The Sup|port of the <HI>O&s;tend Company,</HI> and <HI>Trade</HI> from the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> again&s;t all <HI>Stipulations.</HI></P>
<P>But however this ended at <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Ma|drid;</HI> It mu&s;t have this Effect at <HI>London,</HI> to convince all Per&s;ons, that <HI>no one,</HI> either real or pretended, <HI>Provocation</HI> from <HI>Britain,</HI> gave the fir&s;t <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> for this <HI>new Alliance;</HI> (one End of which was the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Emperor's new and unwarrantable De&s;igns in <HI>Trade:</HI>) So the <HI>Court of Great-Britain,</HI> in the mid&s;t of all Pre|parations for the <HI>Defence</HI> of this <HI>Nation</HI>'s Rights, has not neglected to try <HI>other Methods</HI> of a <HI>peaceable</HI> and <HI>amicable</HI> Nature; but &s;hewn a rea|dine&s;s to do any thing, even for pre&s;ent Peace, except to give up the <HI>Advantages, Rights</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> of <HI>Britain,</HI> of more Importance than pre&s;ent Peace: and the&s;e <HI>Advantages</HI> founded upon Treaties; which therefore, They who pre|&s;ide are obliged to guard and defend, as a &s;acred <HI>Depo&s;itum,</HI> not only out of Love to their <HI>Coun|try,</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="002880_0100_0FE6866754C07830">common to Them with all others, but out of <HI>peculiar Duty</HI> and Obligation; as they are intru&s;t|ed with this <HI>Guardian&s;hip</HI> and Defence, by the <HI>Publick;</HI> and as an Account of this Tru&s;t may ju&s;tly be demanded of them.</P>
<P>If then, nothing rea&s;onable, in the Way of <HI>Ac|commodation,</HI> has been wanting on their Part; They will not ea&s;ily be blamed, (it is to be hoped rather, they will be highly commended) for This, that They have not permitted them&s;elves to be mi&s;led by any &s;mooth Words without Meaning; or to be hindred from taking all nece&s;&s;ary Precau|tions, by any <HI>Amu&s;ements</HI> of <HI>Congre&s;&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Em|ba&s;&s;ies,</HI> or <HI>Negotiations,</HI> only thrown in their Way to gain <HI>Time</HI> to others, and to lo&s;e it to them|&s;elves: Since it is evident, that <HI>irreparable</HI> and <HI>ir|retrievable</HI> Evils might have come from the not ta|king the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary and timely Precautions. And were it &s;o, that They had &s;pent their whole Time in &s;ending and receiving fruitle&s;s Me&s;&s;ages back|wards and forwards, in &s;uch a critical Conjunc|ture; we may venture to &s;ay, we know the Per|&s;ons who would have been the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to charge, (and very de&s;ervedly too) the Ruine of this <HI>Nation</HI> upon them; and to have demanded Ju&s;tice again&s;t them for &s;uch a Conduct, in &s;uch a Time of Dan|ger to their Country.</P>
<P>And indeed, &s;uppo&s;ing this to have been the Ca&s;e; &s;uppo&s;ing the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in &s;uch a Situation; with &s;uch repeated Advices from all Parts; with &s;uch Demon&s;trations of Danger from abroad, as put out of all Doubt the true Nature and De&s;igns of &s;o formidable an <HI>Alliance</HI> as that of the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain:</HI> I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing this Court, &s;urrounded with all the&s;e
<PB N="102" REF="002880_0101_0FE6867CC0180C40">Evidences, to have entered into <HI>no</HI> Mea&s;ures of Defence with any neighbouring <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Prin|ces;</HI> to have taken <HI>no</HI> Steps towards preventing the Mi&s;chief threaten'd; to have &s;ent out <HI>no Na|val Armaments,</HI> either to pre&s;erve any <HI>friendly</HI> Powers, or to qua&s;h any Attempts of <HI>others;</HI> Who would not ri&s;e up, and demand an Account of &s;uch a Conduct from Tho&s;e who alone are to an&s;wer for it? Who would not join in &s;aying,
<Q>Is this the <HI>U&s;age</HI> fit to be given to a <HI>brave</HI> and con&s;idering People? Is this the watchfulne&s;s of <HI>Tho&s;e,</HI> who&s;e Duty it is to attend to every di&s;tant View of Danger? Or, do They think &s;o meanly of <HI>us</HI> and the <HI>whole Nation,</HI> that we can <HI>&s;ee</HI> nothing but what we <HI>feel;</HI> and that we have a Sen&s;e of <HI>no Evil,</HI> but what is <HI>pre&s;ent:</HI> Or, that we are &s;o made, that a <HI>little Expence</HI> would affright us from pre&s;erving our <HI>all;</HI> or, reduced to &s;o <HI>low</HI> a Condition of Poverty, that we can't purcha&s;e or furni&s;h out even <HI>Self-de|fence</HI> to our &s;elves? Were not other <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>States</HI> threatned by the &s;ame Danger; and ready to unite with us? Mu&s;t our <HI>Fleet,</HI> the Glory (as it is call'd) of this Land, lie &s;till and decay, rather than be made our Bulwark? Our <HI>Fleet,</HI> fal&s;ly call'd our <HI>Glory,</HI> but <HI>indeed</HI> our Shame, whil&s;t it is laid a&s;ide as u&s;ele&s;s, at a Time when That alone might make us look too for|midable in <HI>Europe,</HI> to be in&s;ulted or affronted? Or, does even this <HI>Expence</HI> which circulates chiefly among&s;t our&s;elves, appear too formidable to a <HI>Nation</HI> which tho&s;e around it <HI>envy,</HI> as the <HI>Centre</HI> of <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Plenty?</HI> But why do we &s;peak of <HI>Expence?</HI> It is this Method of
<PB N="103" REF="002880_0102_0FE68698A75A7680"><HI>Indolence,</HI> and <HI>Inactivity</HI> upon &s;uch an Occa&s;i|on, which mu&s;t bring after it an <HI>Expence</HI> much <HI>greater</HI> in it &s;elf; and much more hazardous in its Effect; as Time &s;hall add <HI>Strength</HI> to the <HI>Danger</HI> threaten'd: an <HI>Expence,</HI> which mu&s;t <HI>increa&s;e</HI> our Debt, and at the &s;ame Time <HI>dimi|ni&s;h</HI> the Hope of paying it. What Account can we give of &s;uch a <HI>Treatment</HI> of this Nation? As we can find <HI>none</HI> in all the known Mea&s;ures of <HI>Political Prudence;</HI> we mu&s;t &s;earch for it &s;ome|where el&s;e. &mdash; There mu&s;t be <HI>&s;ecret Rea&s;ons</HI> for &s;uch a Conduct; and perhaps <HI>the&s;e</HI> may lye in the <HI>Riches</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;uffered to come &s;afely home, to &s;trengthen and con&s;olidate the mo&s;t dangerous <HI>Conjunction</HI> that ever yet appeared in <HI>Europe</HI></Q>.&mdash; This and much more might ju&s;tly be urged, upon the Suppo&s;ition of a <HI>negligent</HI> and <HI>unactive</HI> Conduct in this <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of <HI>Danger.</HI> And what Reply to make to it, I profe&s;s I think it utterly impo&s;&s;ible to tell.</P>
<P>But this is not the Ca&s;e. The <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has acted quite another Part; and enter'd into <HI>that</HI> Method of <HI>vigorous Self|defence,</HI> by which alone, in all human Wi&s;|dom, there can be the lea&s;t Hope of preventing or repul&s;ing any dangerous Attempts again&s;t all our highe&s;t Concerns: And a <HI>Method,</HI> to which No other Principle could po&s;&s;ibly have directed Tho&s;e who have cho&s;en it, but <HI>That</HI> of an <HI>hone&s;t Regard</HI> to the <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> the <HI>Trade,</HI> the <HI>Rights,</HI> the <HI>Well-Being,</HI> and the <HI>Being</HI> it&s;elf, of this now happy and envied Nation.</P>
