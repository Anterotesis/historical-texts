<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT may not be improper for the Author to apolo|gize for the free manner in which he has cen&s;ured the Society of Friends, in the following treati&s;e. The &s;ubject here di&s;cu&s;&s;ed has long occupied his mind; and being fully per&s;uaded the &s;y&s;tem of Church-govern|ment among that people is wrong, he could not omit expre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments thereon. It &s;eemed more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary, as an Apology for the &s;ociety of which he is a member. In order to &s;hew why they do not excommunicate upon any account, it appeared proper to point out the evils which re&s;ult from the practice. Although the Author firmly believes, that friends err in judgment in admini&s;tring the di&s;ci|pline; yet, as a &s;ociety, he acknowledges they are re&s;pectable, and that many among them are eminent for their piety and virtue. And if, in the cour&s;e of handling this &s;ubject, any thing has dropped from his pen that appears unfriendly, let it be attributed to a difficulty which he found in expre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments in milder terms, again&s;t that which is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the Go&s;pel of our Lord and Saviour, and the great end and de&s;ign of his coming.</P>

<HEAD><HI>AN APOLOGY,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian religion is a religion of love; love even to enemies; yet the genuine effect of it has been &s;o little experienced by many of its profe&s;&s;ors, that it has often been a pretence for the mo&s;t &s;evere cen&s;ures, and cruel per&s;ecutions. In the cour&s;e of Di|vine Providence, this a&s;perity is worn off in &s;ome degree; yet that this benign di&s;pen&s;ation of heaven is not yet fully under&s;tood, the excommunications &s;till practi&s;ed by divers churches, clearly demon&s;trate. The mo&s;t able and re|gular treati&s;e upon the &s;ubject of church authority, and excommunication, is a treati&s;e by Robert Barclay, in|titled, <Q>The Anarchy of the Ranters and other Liber|tines; the Hierarchy of the Romani&s;t, and other pre|tended Churches, equally refu&s;ed, and refuted, in a two-fold apology for the Church and People of God, called in deri&s;ion Quakers,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The publication intitled as above, is ingeniou&s;ly writ|ten, as are all the works of that pious Author; yet the writer of this, being firmly per&s;uaded that Barclay hath erred, conceives it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;how wherein.</P>
<P>The principle laid down by him, and upon which his &s;y&s;tem of church-di&s;cipline is founded, is, that the people called Quakers were, in his day, the pure and only Church of Chri&s;t; that there &s;hould be order in the church, and that excommunication is a part of this order, and ordained by Chri&s;t. The people called Quakers, in the pre&s;ent day, hold the &s;ame doctrine, and Barclay is e&s;teemed unan&s;werable. I &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place, &s;how what the Church of Chri&s;t is; in doing this, it will ap|pear
<PB N="6" REF="035015_0004_0FFFE940934E8910">
that the people called Quakers are not the Church of Chri&s;t as de&s;cribed by Barclay; and therefore have not tho&s;e powers given by Chri&s;t to his Church. And, la&s;t|ly, that were they the Church of Chri&s;t, they could not excommunicate; becau&s;e Chri&s;t hath expre&s;sly forbid|den it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the members of Chri&s;t's body, are tho&s;e who are engrafted on him the vine. "I am the vine," &s;aith he, "ye are the branches, he that abideth in me, and I in him, the &s;ame bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing." The Church of Chri&s;t, therefore, includes all tho&s;e, whoever they are, that by love to Chri&s;t are &s;o united to him, as branches are united to the vine; &s;uch receive from him that &s;pirit which &s;anctifieth them, and leadeth them into all truth. This is agreeable to Barclay, &s;ee page 84, London edition. <Q>None truly ought, nor can be accounted the Church of Chri&s;t, but &s;uch as are in a mea&s;ure &s;anctified, or &s;anctifying by the grace of God, and led by his Spirit, nor yet any made officers in the church but by the grace of God, and inward revelation of his Spirit." And fur|ther, page 29. "The church is &s;uch as are &s;anctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, called to be &s;aints.</Q> Now, as no one is a member, much le&s;s an officer in the Church of Chri&s;t, but tho&s;e who are thus &s;anctified, or &s;anctifying, called to be &s;aints, agreeable to Barclay; and as all who are under this operation, are members of his church, let them belong to whatever &s;ociety they may; &s;o tho&s;e righteous per&s;ons, collectively, con&s;titute the church over which Chri&s;t is head. It will not be controverted, I tru&s;t, but that there are pious per&s;ons among all other &s;ocieties. If there are, to whom do they belong? Do the people called Quakers con&s;titute the body of Chri&s;t complete in all its parts? and are the pious of other &s;ocieties merely &s;uperfluous members of his body? or do they not apper|tain thereto? The pious of other &s;ocieties mu&s;t have the &s;ame relation&s;hip to Chri&s;t, which the pious among the Quakers have; and therefore the pious among each &s;o|ciety con&s;titute the church of Chri&s;t in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as the pious among the Quakers con&s;titute his church; and as all &s;ocieties are made up of tho&s;e who are virtuous,
<PB N="7" REF="035015_0005_0FFFE9421EBCC640">
and tho&s;e who are not; &s;o neither of them are the church of Chri&s;t in contradi&s;tinction to all the re&s;t: Upon the whole, then, this truth follows, a truth comfortable to every Catholic mind, that the church of Chri&s;t is made up of the righteous of every denomination.</P>
<P>The people called Quakers, are, like other &s;ocieties, com|po&s;ed of per&s;ons who are religious and irreligious. Now, the irreligious, tho' not members of Chri&s;t's body, are never|thele&s;s intitled to member&s;hip in this church; it there|fore follows, they are not the pure church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>A man has a right of member&s;hip among the people called Quakers, by being born of believing parents; &s;o that it is rather accidental that many are Quakers: had their parents been of any other per&s;ua&s;ion, they them|&s;elves might have been of another &s;ociety. Now, mem|ber&s;hip in the church of Chri&s;t cannot be by accident, nor lineal de&s;cent: it were unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e &s;o extraordinary a privilege depended upon tho&s;e circum|&s;tances; and, therefore, the people called Quakers can|not be the Church of Chri&s;t, in that &s;en&s;e of the word for which Barclay contends.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t cannot have a regard for one part of mankind in preference to the re&s;t&mdash;he mu&s;t view them with equal love; it is then far from Catholic in any &s;ociety, to &s;up|po&s;e they are his church, di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>The terms of union among the people called Quakers con&s;i&s;t very much in things which may be &s;trictly com|plied with, by corrupt men, and which may yet be vio|lated by the virtuous: It is not &s;o in the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Again. Chri&s;t gave his life for his church, that he might &s;anctify it, and clean&s;e it with the wa&s;hing of wa|ter, by the word; that he might pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf a glorious church, not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing; but that it &s;hould be holy and without blemi&s;h. Can this be applicable to the people called Quakers, or to any di&s;tinct &s;ociety whatever? Did Chri&s;t give his life for them alone? The truth is, that no one church or &s;ociety can appropriate this &s;acred character to them&s;elves: it
<PB N="8" REF="035015_0006_0FFFE943D45542E0">
belongeth only to the righteous of all &s;ocieties, who joint|ly con&s;titute the church over which Chri&s;t is head.</P>
<P>What tho&s;e per&s;ons meant, who, as Barclay &s;ays, de|ny any &s;uch thing as a Church of Chri&s;t, I cannot tell. Barclay has not quoted their expre&s;&s;ions, nor explained their meaning. If they meant that there was no &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians that could with propriety call them&s;elves the Church of Chri&s;t, in contradi&s;tinction to all the re&s;t, they were right. Barclay has a&s;&s;erted, that all churches are fallen, and only pretended churches, excepting the one of which he him&s;elf was a member. Now, if it can be proved, as I tru&s;t it will be in the &s;equel, that this Church (&s;uppo&s;ing the people called Quakers in the pre|&s;ent day to be the &s;ame Church) is not the cha&s;te &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t, but is a mixed multitude, compo&s;ed of per&s;ons of various de&s;criptions, as other churches are,&mdash;it will then follows, upon Barclay's own principles, that Chri&s;t hath not a di&s;tinct and vi&s;ible church on earth.</P>
<P>Barclay, in explaining what is, or may be properly un|der&s;tood by the church, &s;ays, <Q>Some were afraid of the church, the power of the church, the order of the church, the judgment of the church, and &s;uch-like pretences; becau&s;e, &s;aith he, the&s;e have been the wea|pons wherewith Antichri&s;t, and the apo&s;tate chri&s;tians, have been the&s;e many generations per&s;ecuting the wo|man, and warring again&s;t the man-child. And in|deed great di&s;putes have been among the Rabbies in the apo&s;tacy concerning this church; what it is, or what may be &s;o accounted, which I find not my place to dive much into; but &s;hall only give the true &s;en&s;e of it, according to truth, and the &s;criptures plain te&s;ti|mony.</Q> Barclay here refers to a church which for many generations had been invi&s;ible; to explain which he found not his place to dive much into; but only to give, he &s;ays, the true &s;en&s;e of it, according to truth, and the &s;crip|tures plain te&s;timony. Now, to give the true &s;en&s;e of this &s;ubject, according to truth, and the &s;criptures plain te&s;timony, is certainly diving into it; yet he has waved it altogether, and proceeds to give an explanation of the word church&mdash;<Q>That it is a gathering of certain people together, in the belief of the &s;ame principles.</Q> He
<PB N="9" REF="035015_0007_0FFFE94729116D80">
then goes on to di&s;tingui&s;h between that church, gather|ing, or a&s;&s;embly of people, whereof Chri&s;t truly is the head, from &s;uch as pretend fal&s;ely thereto. "Fora&s;|much," &s;aith he, <Q>as &s;anctification and holine&s;s is the great and chief end among Chri&s;tians, which moves them to gather together, therefore the apo&s;tle Paul defines the church in his &s;alutation to the Corinthians, 1. Cor. 1.2. Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, them that are &s;anctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us called to be &s;aints.</Q> This is a proper explanation of the Church of Chri&s;t, and it is much to be de&s;ired that all churches or &s;ocieties in Chri&s;tendom were &s;uch; but what preten&s;ions have the people called Quakers, more than other &s;ocieties, to this di&s;tingui&s;hing character, of &s;aints, and &s;anctified? wherein do they demon&s;trate this? are their affections weaned from the world, and more placed upon things that are above? have they more di|vine benevolence, and philanthropy, and do they follow more perfectly, than others, the great example of Chri&s;t? No doubt but divers among this people, as well as Bar|clay, will an&s;wer in the affirmative, and roundly condemn all others; and we &s;hould find &s;ome among all &s;ocieties a&s;&s;erting the &s;ame of them&s;elves, and as confidently con|demning their neighbours; but what would an impartial being &s;ay? An impartial being would &s;ay, that no one church, or &s;ociety, is the pure Church of Chri&s;t; that they are all fallen, and therefore none of them have tho&s;e powers, and that authority which was ve&s;ted in the primitive church, and which we hope the church will again po&s;&s;e&s;s, when &s;he &s;hall be brought out of the wil|derne&s;s, leaning upon the brea&s;t of her beloved: and for any church in the pre&s;ent day, to pretend to tho&s;e pow|ers, is pre&s;umption. Were an individual, &s;olely led by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, and ve&s;ted with miraculous powers, he would make no high preten&s;ions to extraordinary endowments; and the authority that he was clothed with, would make it&s;elf manife&s;t, without any pains of the creature to &s;et it off; and its authority would be, altoge|ther, of the benevolent, and god-like kind; it would be that of opening the eyes of the blind, un&s;topping the ears of the deaf, healing the &s;ick, rai&s;ing the dead, and
<PB N="10" REF="035015_0008_0FFFE94989D44410">
preaching the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to the poor. And wherever there are extraordinary preten&s;ions to &s;anctity, not accompanied with extraordinary love, and benevo|lence to mankind, we may be a&s;&s;ured they are preten|&s;ions only. So great a degree of mode&s;ty always accom|panies real &s;anctity, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or can never &s;ound forth his own fame. The &s;anctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us re|member the rock from which they were hewn, and the pit from whence they were digged: They do not forget when they were upon the brink of the pit of de&s;truction, and that it was of the Lord's mercy they were re&s;cued, and that it is by the guardian angel of his pre&s;ence they are pre&s;erved and enabled to &s;ing upon the banks of de|liverance. A remembrance of the Lord's gracious deal|ings with them, keeps them in his fear, and from every thing that looks like boa&s;ting. This is the di&s;po&s;ition of all who are &s;anctified; and as Chri&s;t's Church is made up of tho&s;e individuals, &s;o is &s;he his cha&s;te and humble bride. If any one &s;ociety in Chri&s;tendom was wholly compo&s;ed of &s;uch members, that &s;ociety would be as a city &s;et on an hill, which could not be hid: there would be light, and love, and good works, accompanied with the greate&s;t humiliation and mode&s;ty; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pearl of mighty price, the real riches of eternity, being a gift of God, is accompanied with the deepe&s;t humiliation.</P>
<P>The writer of this would be &s;orry to a&s;per&s;e an indivi|dual, much le&s;s a whole &s;ociety: he knows the Friends are re&s;pectable; that there are many among them who are eminently virtuous; yet having &s;hewn, he conceives, they are not the Church of Chri&s;t, according to Bar|clay's definition of the church, it follows they have not tho&s;e powers given by our Lord to his Church, which &s;ome may think they po&s;&s;e&s;s; that what they bind on Earth is bound in Heaven, and what they loo&s;e on Earth is loo&s;ed in Heaven, and to gain&s;ay the whole flock draws after it a far deeper judgement, than if a mill&s;tone was hanged about the offender's neck, and he was drowned in the depth of the &s;ea. In this re&s;pect the &s;ociety of Friends are as weak as any other &s;ociety. <Q>God hath not through them re&s;tored the golden age," as &s;aith Bar|clay,
<PB N="11" REF="035015_0009_0FFFE94B14C4DD30">
"and bringing them into the holy order and go|vernment of his own &s;on, who is ruling and to rule in the mid&s;t of them, &s;etting forth coun&s;ellors as at the beginning and judges as at fir&s;t, and e&s;tabli&s;hing truth, mercy, righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment again in the earth:" Neither have they "power in ca&s;es of faith and con&s;cience, to give a po&s;itive &s;entence and deci&s;ion, which may be obligatory upon believers, or &s;uch as are of their &s;ociety, under pain of being bound on Earth, and bound in Heaven, and lying under a far deeper judgment, than if a mill&s;tone was hanged about the offender's neck, and he drowned in the depth of the &s;ea.</Q> Anarchy of the Ranters, page 14, 41, and 47.</P>
<P>As all the arguments of Barclay, on the power and authority of the Church, apply only to the true Church of Chri&s;t, or powers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the primitive Chri&s;ti|ans; and as it has been &s;hown, that the people called Quakers are not the &s;anctified church or &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t, it follows they have not tho&s;e powers; neither hath any other &s;ociety in Chri&s;tendom, and it is the height of pre|&s;umption in any to a&s;&s;ume them in the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;t, the head of the Church, &s;hall be plea&s;ed to re&s;tore the golden age, bring his Church out of the wilderne&s;s; and give her coun&s;ellors as at the beginning, and judges as at the fir&s;t, and e&s;tabli&s;h truth, mercy, righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment again in the earth; then will order be re&s;tored; for God is a God of order; but what will be the rules and regulations, in this renovated &s;tate of things, is not for us to determine: they will be ac|cording to the mind of Chri&s;t, altogether benevolent, and worthy of him the great law-giver.</P>
<P>It has been generally taken for granted, that excom|munication is a prerogative of the Church of Chri&s;t; all churches who exerci&s;e it, do it upon this principle. The de&s;ign of this e&s;&s;ay is to &s;how that Chri&s;t hath not au|thori&s;ed it. Barclay, to prove his po&s;ition, quotes the following expre&s;&s;ions of our Lord: <Q>Moreover, if thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he &s;hall hear thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother; but if he will not hear
<PB N="12" REF="035015_0010_0FFFE94D72A0D0C0">
thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and if he &s;hall neglect to hear them, tell it the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and publican; verily I &s;ay unto you, what&s;oever ye &s;hall bind on earth, &s;hall be bound in heaven, and what&s;oever ye &s;hall loo&s;e on earth, &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven. From which &s;cripture," &s;aith he, "it doth manife&s;tly, and evidently follow, Fir&s;t, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t intended there &s;hould be a certain method and order in his church, in the proceeding towards &s;uch a tran&s;gre&s;s. Secondly, that he that refu&s;eth to hear two, is become more guilty than hardened in refu&s;ing to hear him that fir&s;t reproved alone. Thirdly, that refu&s;ing to hear the judgment of the church, or whole a&s;&s;embly, he doth thereby exclude him&s;elf, and &s;hut out him&s;elf, from being a member, and is ju&s;tly judged by his brethren as a heathen and publican.</Q></P>
<P>That there &s;hould be order and method in the church is granted, but what that order and method &s;hould be, is the que&s;tion. The propriety of excommunicating is de|nied; there being no warrant for it from the text, as will appear upon examination. <Q>If thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go tell him his fault between thee and him alone." Here is a per&s;onal injury done by a brother. "If he refu&s;es to hear thee, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed. And if he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church, but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and publican.</Q> The plain &s;en&s;e of the text is, that although he be thy brother who has done thee this injury, yet refu&s;ing to hear thee, and your friends, and the church, he &s;hews by his inju&s;tice, that the &s;tate of his mind is that of an heathen man and publican.&mdash;Here is no excommunication in the ca&s;e. Je&s;us does not &s;ay, let him then be ca&s;t out of the church. It will be &s;aid, that it is implied, becau&s;e heathen men and publicans do not belong to the Church of Chri&s;t; but it &s;hall be &s;hewn, that excommunication is contrary
<PB N="13" REF="035015_0011_0FFFE94F1D4F9DC8">
to the fir&s;t great principle of Chri&s;tianity, and by Je&s;us expre&s;sly forbidden; and therefore could not have been the meaning of our Lord. This man, although he may remain within the pale of the church, is nece&s;&s;arily ex|cluded member&s;hip from the my&s;tical body of Chri&s;t; he is to be con&s;idered in the &s;tate of an heathen man and publican. Now, what is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the church with heathens and publicans? Is it not to inform their under|&s;tandings, and to convert them to the Chri&s;tian faith? So that, in&s;tead of ca&s;ting the man out, and having nothing further to do with him, the church has a great and an important work before it; it is to open and manife&s;t the grounds and rea&s;ons of the Chri&s;tian faith; to &s;hew this man, that although he has been a profe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;t, he is yet unacquainted with the fir&s;t rudiments of the go&s;pel. All this is to be done, and whatever more which in divine wi&s;dom may be manife&s;ted as proper. And for the encou|ragement of the di&s;ciples, Je&s;us a&s;&s;ures them that this labour of their's in this important work &s;hall be approved in heaven; what&s;oever ye &s;hall bind on earth, is bound in heaven, and what&s;oever ye &s;hall loo&s;e on earth is loo&s;ed in heaven. This is evidently the doctrine from the text, and context, as will clearly appear if it be taken together. That which is recommended by our Lord to his di&s;ciples, corre&s;ponds with his own great work and labour of love. He introduced what he &s;aid re&s;pecting the brother who tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, as follows: <Q>The &s;on of man is come to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t. How think ye, if a man have an hundred &s;heep, and one of them be gone a&s;tray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountain and &s;eeketh that which is gone a&s;tray, and if &s;o be, that he find it, verily I &s;ay unto you, he re|joiceth more over that &s;heep than of the ninety and nine which went not a&s;tray. Even &s;o, it is not the will of your father who is in heaven, that one of the&s;e little ones &s;hould peri&s;h." Je&s;us then adds to the fore|going, "moreover, if thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, tell him his fault between thee and him alone,</Q> and &s;o directs, how this tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing brother is to be dealt with, in order to be reclaimed: to re&s;tore the lo&s;t &s;heep is the object in view. And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he

who came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t, and gave his life for this purpo&s;e, would direct, that any per&s;on whatever &s;hould be placed in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be de|prived of the ble&s;&s;ing of the church? But it may be &s;aid, the man refu&s;es that help which is offered by the church, and is as an heathen man and publican. Why not then &s;et him a&s;ide? To which I reply: Becau&s;e Je&s;us hath expre&s;sly forbidden it, as will be further &s;hewn in the &s;equel. Je&s;us knows it is impo&s;&s;ible for men to make &s;uch a di&s;crimination, as that the righteous &s;hall make up a di&s;tinct &s;ociety from the re&s;t of mankind. He who knows what lodges in men, has with infinite wi&s;dom warned his followers again&s;t the attempt: he could have expelled Judas from the company of his followers; but as an example of compa&s;&s;ion, and a le&s;&s;on to future ge|nerations, &s;uffered him to remain with them, until the la&s;t &s;olemn &s;upper. The &s;alvation of men being of infinite importance; what &s;ituation can a man be placed in, &s;o favourable to him in this re&s;pect as within the pale of the church? If he be ca&s;t out, whither is he to go? If he may be reformed as well out of the pale, as within, then indeed his being within is but of little con&s;equence; but if it operates as an injury, or is le&s;s favourable to him, it is wrong to &s;et him a&s;ide. The truth is, it is not proper for us to &s;ay, when men may, or may not be re|formed, nor &s;hould we do any thing which might operate to the di&s;couragement of a per&s;on, in a matter of &s;o much importance to him as his reformation. Times and &s;ea&s;ons in this re&s;pect, are neither in the power of tho&s;e who wi&s;h the man's good, nor in the man him&s;elf: the Lord's gracious vi&s;itation is the time in which alone he can be reformed. This he will meet with either &s;ooner or later, and if he then be obedient to the gracious call, he &s;hall be &s;anctified.</P>
<P>That our Lord hath expre&s;sly forbidden excommuni|cation, is plain from the following parable. <Q>The king|dom of heaven," &s;ays he, "is likened unto a man which &s;owed good &s;eed in his field, but while men &s;lept, his enemy came and &s;owed tares among the wheat, and went his way; but when the blade was &s;prung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the
<PB N="15" REF="035015_0013_0FFFE955E5892180">
tares al&s;o; &s;o the &s;ervants of the hou&s;ehold came and &s;aid unto him, &s;ir, did&s;t not thou &s;ow good &s;eed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? he &s;aid unto them, an enemy hath done this: the &s;ervants &s;aid un|to him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? but he &s;aid nay, le&s;t while ye gather up the tares, ye root up al&s;o the wheat with them: let both grow to|gether until the harve&s;t, and the time of harve&s;t. I will &s;ay to the reapers gather ye together, fir&s;t the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</Q> And when his di&s;|ciples reque&s;ted an explanation of the parable, Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, <Q>he that &s;oweth the good &s;eed is the &s;on of man, the field is the world, the good &s;eed is the chil|dren of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one, the enemy that &s;owed them is the devil, the harve&s;t is the end of the world, and the reapers are the angels; as therefore the tares are ga|thered and burned in the fire, &s;o &s;hall it be in the end of the world. The &s;on of man &s;hall &s;end forth his angels, and they &s;hall gather out of his kingdom all things which offend, and them which do iniquity, and &s;hall ca&s;t them into a furnace of fire, there &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth. Then &s;hall the righteous &s;hine forth as the &s;un in the kingdom of their father.</Q> Je&s;us concluded this explanation very remarkably, "who hath ears to hear let him hear." Happy had it been for the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, if their ears had been open to hear the gracious word of their ma&s;ter. Has not every church in Chri&s;tendom di&s;|regarded the doctrine contained in the parable? The tares in their opinion mu&s;t be &s;eparated from the wheat; but in this attempt, have not all churches uniformly done as Je&s;us &s;aid there would be a danger of doing? <Q>The &s;ervants &s;aid unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up:" meaning the tares? "but he &s;aid nay, le&s;t while ye gather up the tares, yet root up al&s;o the wheat with them?</Q> What mi&s;chief has the Roman church made in this attempt, much precious grain has been de&s;troyed, under a pretence, or from an appre|hen&s;ion they were tares. Many virtuous men have been
<PB N="16" REF="035015_0014_0FFFE95770D23AE0">
excommunicated by that church; and mo&s;t, if not all other churches, have done the &s;ame; excommunications are not confined to immoralities only; but men are di&s;|owned for their &s;entiments al&s;o, and even the people called Quakers have expelled men from them for that which was highly meritorious. As a proof of this, I may in&s;tance Ralph Sandiford, and Benjamin Lay, who were di&s;owned for their te&s;timony again&s;t keeping Ne|groes in bondage.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, by any literal rule, to &s;eparate the tares from the wheat: this can never be done, until the &s;on of man &s;hall &s;end forth his angels, and gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and tho&s;e who do ini|quity. It may be queried of me, would&s;t thou then &s;uffer immoralities of every kind to remain in the church, and go unrebuked? No: Rebuke, exhort, te&s;tify again&s;t all evil, from time to time, as thou maye&s;t be enabled. But what if &s;inners &s;tiffen their necks, and harden their hearts, are they &s;till to remain in the church? It is not in the wi&s;dom of man to &s;eparate the virtuous from the vicious. But may not divine wi&s;dom direct us to make &s;uch rules as will keep the church clean? This hath never yet been done. Divine wi&s;dom, fore&s;eeing the evils that would en&s;ue in the attempt, hath forbidden it. How is it po&s;&s;ible a line can be drawn, or any rule made, &s;o as that all virtuous characters &s;hall con&s;titute a di&s;tinct &s;ociety? We will &s;uppo&s;e, for example, that a good moral character &s;hall be the te&s;t to entitle to member|&s;hip in &s;ociety; but how &s;hall we e&s;tabli&s;h a criterion to determine this good moral character? A man may not &s;teal, or be guilty of a manife&s;t act of inju&s;tice, yet &s;o clo&s;e, artful, and hard in his dealings, as in the &s;ight of heaven &s;hall amount to the &s;ame thing: a man may be covetous, over-reach his neighbour, and grind the face of the poor, and no rule can lay hold on him. Then, covetou&s;ne&s;s, which is as the &s;in of idolatry, remains in the church. Further, we will &s;ay a drunkard &s;hall be di&s;owned; but may there not be &s;o great a degree of &s;en&s;uality, as to be equally criminal with drunkenne&s;s, and yet no rule which can lay hold on the man? Again, what is wor&s;e than pride? and can a rule be made &s;o as
<PB N="17" REF="035015_0015_0FFFE9590D0F0098">
to point it out? May it not remain in the church in de|fiance of all rules? May it not be active in church affairs? May not envying, back-biting, and evil reports prevail, and yet no rule &s;o to di&s;criminate offenders as they can be excluded from member&s;hip? Again: may there not be a total lifele&s;&s;ne&s;s in religion, a dry and barren &s;tate, as far from any thing which is good, and divine, as immo|ral conduct; and yet, as we cannot &s;ee the hearts of men, no rule would point out &s;uch ca&s;es? Tho&s;e things may and will prevail. Seeing, then, it is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;o to clean&s;e the church, but that there will be as unworthy characters within the pale as without; and when no good can be done by di&s;owning; but, on the contrary, many individuals and families made extremely unhappy by it, is it not then better to let it alone?</P>
<P>The following query, is often read in the meeting. Is tale-bearing, back-biting, and evil reports di&s;couraged? And yet, admini&s;tering the rules of the &s;ociety often &s;pread &s;candal far and wide. The over&s;eers of the church are &s;pies upon the conduct of the members. (I doubt not they mean well.) Scarce one can pa&s;s unnoticed; and when any thing of an immoral nature is heard of, the matter is &s;ifted to the bottom; and if a per&s;on is found guilty, his ca&s;e is taken to the monthly meeting, and laid open before great numbers. Suppo&s;e a young woman, &s;educed by a man, who had gained her affections: She is expo|&s;ed before &s;ome hundreds; many of whom are giddy and thoughtle&s;s: we &s;ee them &s;miling perhaps in the meeting at her di&s;a&s;ter; and when they mingle among their acquain|tance, are repeating the &s;orrowful tale. The ca&s;e of this poor creature is called over once a month, until &s;he is pronounced either a penitent, or not &s;o. In either ca&s;e, &s;he is further expo&s;ed: if a penitent, &s;he condemns her conduct, and it is read at a public meeting for wor&s;hip before &s;ome thou&s;ands: if &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed not penitent, &s;he is publicly ca&s;t out of the church. Oh! Je&s;us, thou compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour of men, thou friend of publicans and &s;inners, is this done in thy name, and by thy autho|rity? Thou, who re&s;cued the poor woman who was taken in adultery, from the hands of the Phari&s;ees; thou who ca&s;t &s;even devils out of Mary Magdalen, and who reveal|ed

thy&s;elf more clearly and explicitly to the woman at Jacob's well than to many others; thou who &s;wate drops of blood in the garden of Geth&s;emane, and who died upon the cro&s;s to &s;ave &s;inners, and who&s;e whole divine proce&s;s was a my&s;tery of love, which angels de&s;ired to look into! are tho&s;e things done in thy name? Ha&s;t thou authori&s;ed &s;inners thus to deal with &s;inners? Verily, nay. But as has been before ob&s;erved, it is not for things which are &s;inful only, but for tho&s;e which are innocent, that &s;ome are di&s;owned. Per&s;ons are di&s;owned for marrying tho&s;e of another &s;ociety: men may be di&s;owned for pay|ing a tax, or a fine, or for defending that government, by which tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who exerci&s;e this authority of excommunication, hold their lives and their property. Per&s;ons may be di&s;owned who are virtuous, and yet the vicious e&s;cape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e are ca&s;es which not only may happen, but they are facts which do frequently happen. A long li&s;t of the di&s;owned, per&s;onally known to the author, might be enumerated, of as re&s;pectable charac|ters as any that are members of the &s;ociety. The following is a me|morial of Thomas Thomas, drawn up by a few of his acquaintance, to pre&s;erve in their families the memory of that amiable man.</P><P>"On the twelfth of the tenth month, 1780, died Thomas Thomas, of Richland, Bucks County, in the &s;ixty-&s;econd year of his age. A man who, through the cour&s;e of his life, was eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by his integrity and exemplary piety. In him were eminently joined the principal virtues that adorn the Chri&s;tian,&mdash;a true evangelical cha|rity crowning the whole. In him the poor, the widow, and the fa|therle&s;s, had ever a &s;incere &s;ympathi&s;ing friend and liberal benefactor. To the&s;e his memory will remain peculiarly dear and venerable. He was many years an honourable elder, and over&s;eer of Richland month|ly meeting, faithfully labouring, and cheerfully &s;pending him&s;elf in the di&s;charge of the duties of tho&s;e important &s;tations,&mdash;religiou&s;ly ap|plying him&s;elf with unwearied diligence, to cultivate peace, brother|ly love, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, through may painful exerci&s;es and fatigue|ing travels, until (Oh, for a veil if po&s;&s;ible broad enough to cover the remainder of the &s;cene) the &s;ame congregation a few months before the clo&s;e of his pious life, which had been devoted to their &s;ervice, re|warded him with a total excommunication; becau&s;e he could not in con&s;cience deviate from the great example of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and the clear precepts of his apo&s;tles, in rendering tribute to the pre&s;ent government, from which alone he could receive protection; believing it his duty, to yield a peaceable &s;ubjection, to whatever form of go|vernment it plea&s;ed divine providence to place over him. This &s;evere mea&s;ure, though deeply wounding and afflictive, he &s;u&s;tained with a meek and patient fortitude, truly becoming his exemplary and unble|mi&s;hed character. This &s;hort memorial we owe to the memory of the upright man, our dear friend, who having paid the debt of nature, has left his &s;urvivors to mourn their lo&s;s, and is gone before, to obey with joy the gracious call, of <Q>come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</Q></P><P>Here let my reader pau&s;e! and if he be one of the people called Quakers, let me a&s;k him, how many &s;uch characters have they remaining in their &s;ociety? What proportion in number do they bear to the whole? And is it po&s;&s;ible, the &s;ociety can &s;uppo&s;e they are right, in di&s;owning &s;uch men, whil&s;t many thou&s;ands among them e&s;cape cen&s;ure, who have no religion at all?

which operate thus? But was the end attainable, which is aimed at by the di&s;cipline, which is that of &s;eparating the vicious from the virtuous, it would even then be im|proper, as will be further &s;hewn in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners: he laid down his life for &s;uch. Is it po&s;&s;ible, then, to reconcile ex|communication with &s;uch love? But &s;aith Barclay, <Q>were &s;uch a principle to be received, or believed, that in the Church of Chri&s;t, no man &s;hould be &s;eparated from, no man condemned, or excluded from the fellow&s;hip and communion of the body, for his judgment or opinion in matters of faith, then what bla&s;phemies &s;o horrid, what here&s;ies &s;o damnable, what doctrine of devils but might harbour it&s;elf in the Church of Chri&s;t, what need then of &s;ound doctrine, if no doctrine make un&s;ound.</Q> To this I reply: No man &s;hould be &s;o &s;eparated from the fellow&s;hip and communion of the body, as implies an incon&s;i&s;tency, with that funda|mental of the go&s;pel, viz. Chri&s;t laying down his life for the &s;ins of the world. The virtuous cannot have fellow&s;hip, or be plea&s;ed with the conduct of the vicious, or they would cea&s;e to be virtuous; but the virtuous, and the vicious may belong to the &s;ame outward &s;ociety, and a&s;&s;emble together in a place appointed for divine wor&s;hip, and this may well be &s;uppo&s;ed without coun|tenancing that which is wicked. It is the ca&s;e in all &s;ocie|ties. And if there &s;hould be in the church, even horrid bla&s;phemies, and damnable doctrines of devils, it does not follow, that unle&s;s the per&s;ons who hold them are di&s;owned, that tho&s;e evils are countenanced; and there|fore, it is not to the purpo&s;e to &s;ay, as Barclay has &s;aid, what need of &s;ound doctrines, if no doctrine make un|&s;ound? what need of convincing, and exhorting gain|&s;ayers, if to gain&s;ay be no crime? Does this follow, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, if per&s;ons are not excommuni|cated
<PB N="20" REF="035015_0018_0FFFE96126A4F1C0">
for evils? Is there no alternative between excom|municating and countenancing them? May not all who abhor iniquity bear as &s;trong a te&s;timony again&s;t it, if wicked or mi&s;taken men remain within the pale of the church, as if they were turned out? If we were at liberty only to reprove wickedne&s;s, may we not dete&s;t it as much as if we were obliged to put &s;inners to death? So that, when I contend again&s;t excommunication, and maintain it incon&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel, it is not to make light of evils of any kind: There is great need of &s;ound doctrine; and there is none more worthy of atten|tention than that of love to mankind. Let tho&s;e who are influenced by it, endeavour to convince: let them ex|hort, and te&s;tify with great zeal, again&s;t all that is wrong: The virtuous mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity do it; yet there is a wide difference between that dete&s;tation and te&s;timony, which the righteous bear again&s;t iniquity, and that te&s;timony again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, which often operates to their injury. To omit di&s;owning, therefore, would not be an inlet, as Barclay a&s;&s;erts it would, <Q>to all manner of abominations, and make void the whole tendency of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles' doctrine, and a bidding farewell to all Chri&s;|tianity, or to the maintaining any &s;ound doctrine in the Church of Chri&s;t:</Q> (page 51.) All that can po&s;&s;i|bly be done to prevent tho&s;e evils, may be done more effectually, without excommunicating the &s;inner. It is generally the ca&s;e, after a few months vi&s;iting &s;uch who act ami&s;s, if there is no appearance of reformation, they are di&s;owned, after which they are lightly e&s;teemed, and neglected; and are in danger of being lo&s;t; whereas, were they &s;till members of the &s;ociety, and favourable oppor|tunities taken with them in brotherly love, many might be re&s;tored to virtue.</P>
<P>One argument, urged in favour of di&s;owning, is, that it is nece&s;&s;ary for the reputation of the &s;ociety. To allow wicked per&s;ons to remain in the church, it is &s;aid, would be a reproach to it. Were &s;inners &s;uffered to retain a right of member&s;hip in &s;ociety, with a view to countenance that which is evil, it would then be reproachful indeed; but no &s;uch thing is contended for. Barclay has taken for granted, that the people called Quakers were the
<PB N="21" REF="035015_0019_0FFFE962FA3B3230">
Church of Chri&s;t; that Chri&s;t's Church is pure, having no &s;pot or blemi&s;h or any &s;uch thing; therefore, all evil mu&s;t be condemned, and the &s;inner, unle&s;s he repent, expelled from the church; but, it has and will be fur|ther &s;hewn, that until Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;hall come again, no &s;uch church can exi&s;t, and that which is true of the in|vi&s;ible Church, the bride of Chri&s;t only, is a&s;&s;umed by a &s;ociety of frail and imperfect men.</P>
<P>All mankind are, or were &s;inners; and, therefore, while &s;o, are not members of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical body, or of his pure church; but he came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t, or to initiate them into member&s;hip in his church. Now, can putting away be right, when the &s;ole object of Je&s;us is to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t? If member&s;hip in &s;o|ciety be an advantage, mu&s;t not di&s;owning be a di&s;ad|vantage? Mu&s;t it not place a man in an unfavourable &s;i|tuation; and is it not &s;trange, that &s;inners who have been reclaimed, or improved in virtue by means of mem|ber&s;hip in &s;ociety, &s;hould be zealous for putting others away, and thereby deprive them of tho&s;e advantages, which they them&s;elves profe&s;s to have received? It will be &s;aid they are not put away, until they are laboured with, and refu&s;e to be reclaimed; but it is not for us to &s;et limits to the love of Je&s;us, neither &s;hould men &s;et li|mits to their own labours of love: We ought never to give over &s;triving: it is imitating the great example of him who &s;leepeth not by day, nor &s;lumbereth by night; but is always waiting to be gracious to every &s;on of fallen Adam.</P>
<P>As to the reproach which would fall on the church, from the unrighteous, let it be remembered that Chri&s;t Je&s;us left that &s;ociety who po&s;&s;e&s;s tran&s;cendant virtue, and came among &s;inners. He conver&s;ed with Mary Magdalen, with the woman at Jacob's well, with the woman taken in adultery, and was frequently a gue&s;t with &s;inners. And was it not becau&s;e all men are &s;inners that he came into the world? If, then, it was no reproach to Je&s;us, that he accompanied with &s;inners, it would be no reproach to any &s;ociety, if bad characters were among them, if tho&s;e per&s;ons were continued in member&s;hip with a view to their reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="035015_0020_0FFFE96808A760B8">Suppo&s;e there were a &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians, every member of which was perfect: If it be right to di&s;|own men becau&s;e they are imperfect, it could not be right to admit any into member&s;hip unle&s;s they were perfect; and if men may attain perfection independent|ly of &s;uch a &s;ociety, what advantage could they derive from joining them? as improvement in virtue is that which is propo&s;ed by all religious a&s;&s;ociations.</P>
<P>Imperfect men will con&s;titute a great part of all &s;o|cieties; and if &s;o, how &s;hall we a&s;certain, what charac|ters to admit, and what to reject? Is there a line &s;o clear|ly vi&s;ible, as that we can draw it with &s;afety, and &s;ay all on one &s;ide are of right members, and all on the other &s;ide are properly excluded? Attempts have been made by mo&s;t &s;ocieties; a line has been drawn; but as injudi|ciou&s;ly, as if an ingenious geographer &s;hould attempt to mark out the boundaries of heaven, and of hell, and the line which &s;eparates them. It is granted, there is a perfect di&s;tinction between good and evil, yet good and evil are often blended together in the &s;ame per&s;on; and among virtuous men, &s;ome are more eminently &s;o than others; &s;o among bad characters, there are &s;ome more depraved than others, and as there are degrees of virtue and vice, &s;o the lea&s;t among the virtuous mu&s;t approach &s;o near to the lea&s;t among the vicious, as that no man can &s;ay to which cla&s;s they belong; and, therefore, Je|&s;us hath forbidden to di&s;criminate by expul&s;ion from his Church, having re&s;erved it to a future day.</P>
<P>Improvement in piety and virtue, is the object inten|ded by all religious a&s;&s;ociations. Is it not then highly im|proper to expel men from &s;ociety, merely becau&s;e they want that which is aimed at by the a&s;&s;ociation?</P>
<P>A religious &s;ociety &s;hould be a &s;piritual infirmary, where mea&s;ures ought to be taken to heal the di&s;ea&s;ed. Shall we then, if per&s;ons appear dangerou&s;ly ill, turn them out of doors?</P>
<P>It will be objected to the foregoing, that the primitive Church was in the practice of di&s;owning. Barclay has quoted much &s;cripture to prove this, and that the church he was a member of had the &s;ame authority. I tru&s;t it

will appear he was mi&s;taken in both ca&s;es. He proceeds, (See Anarchy of the Ranters, page 18, 22, and 49.) <Q>1. Corinthians, 5. Chap. 3 and 4 ver. I, indeed, as ab&s;ent in body, but pre&s;ent in &s;pirit, have judged alrea|dy, as though I were pre&s;ent, concerning him that hath &s;o done this deed. In the name of our Lord Je|&s;us, when ye are gathered together, and my &s;pirit, with the power of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to deliver &s;uch a one to &s;atan for the de&s;truction of the fle&s;h, that the &s;pirit may be &s;aved in the day of the Lord." And 2d The&s;&s;alonians, 3d Chap. 6th ver. "Now we com|mand you brethren in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that ye withdraw your&s;elves from every brother that walketh di&s;orderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us;" Ver&s;e 14th, "and if any man obey not our word by this epi&s;tle, note that man, and have no company with him that he may be a&s;hamed.

<P>The foregoing is produced, together with various other texts to prove the propriety of di&s;owning. What the apo&s;tle meant by delivering per&s;ons over to &s;atan that they may learn not to bla&s;pheme, or the cur&s;e denounced upon &s;uch as preach any other go&s;pel than that he had preached, is not ea&s;y to under&s;tand. It is &s;ufficient for us to know what Barclay meant. Now, cur&s;ing, or de|livering per&s;ons to &s;atan, or a&s;&s;igning them over to fu|ture damnation, or di&s;owning, are all &s;ynonimous with him; and it mu&s;t be &s;o, if his fir&s;t principles are admit|ted; for if the people called Quakers are Chri&s;t's Church on earth, all who are expelled from this church, are ab|&s;olutely excluded member&s;hip from Chri&s;t's Church in

Heaven; becau&s;e, the &s;ame power and &s;pirit rules in both. The people called Quakers profe&s;s to be led and guided in their deci&s;ions by the Holy Spirit. Upon this principle they call them&s;elves the Church of Chri&s;t. If, then, they are led by the Holy Spirit to di&s;own, the per&s;ons &s;o di&s;|owned are in a mo&s;t fearful &s;ituation. Barclay has taken a great deal of pains to prove that the people called Quakers were the Church of Chri&s;t: that what they bound on earth, was bound in Heaven, and what they loo&s;ed on earth was loo&s;ed in Heaven; and that for a man to offend one of tho&s;e little ones, it were better that a mill-&s;tone hanged about his neck, and he drowned in the depth of the &s;ea, and to gain&s;ay the whole flock, mu&s;t be more criminal, and draw after it a far deeper judg|ment. Now, what can this deeper judgment mean? Eter|nal damnation upon Barclay's principles. Let me a&s;k the Friends of the pre&s;ent day whether this is what they mean? If they mean this, is it not pre&s;umption to pronounce a &s;entence in the name of the mo&s;t high, again&s;t a man of &s;ober life, which implies he is a&s;&s;igned over to damnation? Here &s;ome will exclaim, and &s;ay, that no &s;uch thing is meant. Tho&s;e Friends may be told, that excommunica|tion from the Church of Chri&s;t, implies an exclu&s;ion from the kingdom of Heaven, which Barclay well un|der&s;tood, and has &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in the treati&s;e now quoted; and if the Friends of the pre&s;ent day do not mean it, I may a&s;k them whether they have not departed from the principle of their forefathers? All churches who have excommunicated, have done it upon this ground, that they were the pure Church of Chri&s;t; and excommunication with them meant damnation. The Roman Catholics &s;peak plain, and cur&s;e &s;uch whom they di&s;own, with a mo&s;t fearful cur&s;e.</P>
<P>If friends do not mean by it an exclu&s;ion from the kingdom of heaven, it may be a&s;ked what do they mean? It will be replied, we mean to bear our te&s;timony again&s;t certain conduct which we di&s;approve. And might you not bear your te&s;timony again&s;t tho&s;e things without di&s;|owning for them? There are many things for which men are di&s;owned, which will not be alledged again&s;t them, as &s;inful, by the judge of all the earth; and on the other
<PB N="25" REF="035015_0023_0FFFE96E6DCC6168">
hand, there are many evils, for which you do not di&s;own which will at the day of judgment, exclude men from admittance among the ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having remarked as above, I proceed to take &s;ome notice of tho&s;e anathemas of the apo&s;tle Paul. It is granted, that on &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ions, the apo&s;|tle pronounced a fearful cur&s;e. What was the ceremony, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, we are not told in the text, though &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers have given their conjectures. It does not appear that tho&s;e per&s;ons were ca&s;t out of the church; the ince&s;tuous Corinthian, though he was delivered over to Satan, for the de&s;truction of the fle&s;h, yet it was, that the &s;pirit might be &s;aved in the day of the Lord. This cen|&s;ure and proce&s;s, whatever it might have been, was in|tended to be &s;alutary, and &s;o it proved; for the apo&s;tle, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, recommended it to them to forgive and comfort this man, le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;wallowed up with over-much &s;orrow. And the The&s;|&s;alonians, although commanded in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, to withdraw from every brother that walked di&s;|orderly, and to note the man who obeyed not the word of that epi&s;tle, to have no company with him, that he may be a&s;hamed; yet the apo&s;tle adds, count him not an enemy, but admoni&s;h him as a brother. So that, whatever was done to the man, his &s;alvation was kept in view: they were not to forget he was their brother, and therefore he could not have been excommunicated.</P>
<P>As to the cur&s;e pronounced upon tho&s;e who preached another go&s;pel than that which the apo&s;tle preached, it is to be pre&s;umed, that &s;uch did not wi&s;h to a&s;&s;ociate with the apo&s;tles of our Lord, and &s;o going off from them, if they ever belong to the church, there could not be a nece&s;&s;ity for an excommunication. If the apo&s;tle &s;aw &s;uch were in a &s;tate of damnation, it was his duty to declare it, as a warning to the believers not to be deceiv|ed by them. This affords no argument for excommuni|cation. With re&s;pect to Hymenius, and Alexander, whom the apo&s;tle delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to bla&s;pheme, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame was intended as was in the ca&s;e of the ince&s;tuous Corinthian: whether the &s;ame &s;alutary effects followed, we are not informed; but that they were not di&s;owned, is evident from the con|text.
<PB N="26" REF="035015_0024_0FFFE970D9F43210">
This Hymenius is probably the &s;ame per&s;on the apo&s;tle has &s;poken of in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy: he has there Philetus for a companion. It appears they were <Q>prophane bablers, who&s;e words eat as doth a canker, who concerning the truth had erred, &s;aying the re&s;ur|rection is pa&s;t already, and overthrew the faith of &s;ome" Neverthele&s;s," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "the foundation of God &s;tands &s;ure, having this &s;eal, the lord knoweth them that are his, and let every one that nameth the name of Chri&s;t depart from iniquity." He then adds, But in a great hou&s;e there are not only ve&s;&s;els of gold, and of &s;ilver, but al&s;o of wood and of earth, and &s;ome to honour, and &s;ome to di&s;honour. It a man therefore purge him&s;elf from the&s;e, he &s;hall be a ve&s;&s;el unto ho|nour, &s;anctified and meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and pre|pared unto every good work.</Q> From the foregoing, it is plain, that Hymenius, Alexander and Philetus were not di&s;owned. The great hou&s;e here &s;poken of, is no doubt the church; in this hou&s;e, there are not only ve&s;|&s;els of gold, and of &s;ilver, but al&s;o of wood and of earth, and &s;ome to honour and &s;ome to di&s;honour. Now altho' Hymenius, Alexander, and Philetus, could not be mem|bers of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical church, they yet might belong to the vi&s;ible church, or &s;ociety; they were ve&s;&s;els of &s;ome kind or other in the great hou&s;e, and although not ve&s;|&s;els of gold, or of &s;ilver; not ve&s;&s;els of honour, not &s;anctified and meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and prepared unto every good work, they might comparatively be ve&s;&s;els of wood, or of earth, or of di&s;honour. The apo&s;tle has here given a &s;triking illu&s;tration of the out|ward church, and &s;uch as corre&s;ponds exactly with what is contended for in this e&s;&s;ay; but far different from that which was attempted by Barclay, and his bre|thren. According to them, none ought to belong to this hou&s;e, but &s;uch as are &s;anctified and meet for the matter's u&s;e, expre&s;sly contrary to the words of the apo&s;tle, who admits that un&s;anctified ve&s;&s;els may remain in the hou&s;e. Yet after all the pains taken by the Friends, thus to purge their &s;ociety, they are neverthele&s;s &s;uch an hou&s;e, who have among them ve&s;&s;els of various kinds, ve&s;&s;els of gold, of &s;ilver, of wood, and of earth; &s;ome to honour, and &s;ome to di&s;honour. The apo&s;tle, no doubt, made u&s;e of
<PB N="27" REF="035015_0025_0FFFE9733705C8F0">
the above &s;imilitude, to &s;hew it was be&s;t to let Hymenius and Philetus, together with other un&s;anctified per&s;ons, remain in the hou&s;e. And to excite in them, a virtuous emulation, &s;ays, If a man purge him&s;elf from the evils above, he &s;hall be a ve&s;&s;el unto honour, &s;anctified, and meet for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, and prepared unto every good work. The apo&s;tle holds up the po&s;&s;ibility of this, and therefore admits them a part of the great family. And let me a&s;k the people called Quakers, whether they have not in their great hou&s;e, un&s;anctified ve&s;&s;els, for which ne|verthele&s;s they find &s;ome u&s;e?</P>
<P>Altho' virtue is very de&s;irable among men, as it adds to their u&s;efulne&s;s in all the various concerns of life, yet we mu&s;t not put away tho&s;e per&s;ons that appear not to po&s;|&s;e&s;s it. All mankind are ve&s;&s;els in the hou&s;e of the great ma&s;ter, he hath tho&s;e of gold, of &s;ilver, of wood, and of earth; he has his ve&s;&s;els of honour and of di&s;honour, and they are all u&s;ed by him according to their fitne&s;s for his purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>At the time John wrote his revelations, the Chri&s;tians were numerous: there were &s;even churches in A&s;ia; and yet only two of them that were not rebuked, &s;ome of them very &s;everely, many great evils had crept in among them. Had the apo&s;tles &s;een it were po&s;&s;ible to prevent tho&s;e evils, there is no doubt but they would have u&s;ed means for the purpo&s;e. If they had ever excommuni|cated, and it was well adapted for this end, there mu&s;t have been great remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in the churches to have per|mitted evils to have gotten to &s;uch a heighth; but we can|not &s;uppo&s;e during the life of John the Divine, any mea|&s;ures were omitted that were proper to pre&s;erve the church pure, and therefore the churches could not have excom|municated. And it de&s;erves e&s;pecial notice, that this &s;e|vere reprehen&s;ion of our Lord, was the effects of his love, &s;uch as I love I rebuke and cha&s;ten, be zealous therefore and repent. We may therefore fairly infer, that tho&s;e men tho' wicked, being the objects of the love of Je&s;us, were permitted to remain in that &s;ituation, which was the mo&s;t likely to favour their reformation: that &s;ituation is the outward church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t it is already proved, that di&s;owning cannot be reconciled with the great principle upon which Chri&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="035015_0026_0FFFE974C6ABF648">
came into the world. Had it even appeared, that in &s;ome in&s;tances it was practi&s;ed in the days of the apo&s;tles, that would not make wrong right. Many of the primitive Chri&s;tians had belonged to the church of the Phari&s;ees, and as excommunication was a part of their di&s;cipline, &s;o tho&s;e converts might have carried with them a prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion in favour of the practice. We read that Diotrephes, loving to have the pre-eminence, ca&s;t &s;ome out of the church. This is the only plain in&s;tance mentioned in &s;crip|ture of an excommunication, and which was cen&s;ured by John; but as is above ob&s;erved, if in other in&s;tances it had been practi&s;ed in the church, and that it was what eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers &s;uppo&s;e it to have been, a&s;&s;igning men over to the Devil, with all the cur&s;es of the Mo&s;aic law denounced again&s;t them; what have we to do with this Judai&s;m? Are we under that di&s;pen&s;ation? And is it not &s;urpri&s;ing, that Barclay &s;hould have produced the cur&s;es of the Mo&s;aic law, to illu&s;trate, or to prove di&s;owning to be agreeable to the nature of the go&s;pel? If it be ju&s;|tifiable to cur&s;e a man for &s;ome horrid crime, did Mo&s;es, or the apo&s;tle Paul, ever mean, that all the cur&s;es of the law &s;hould be pronounced upon every member of the con|gregation, who &s;hould defend his own life, or his friends, or the government under which he lived, or who mar|ried a woman except of a particular tribe? The go&s;pel is not cur&s;ing, but ble&s;&s;ing, and doing good even to ene|mies.</P>
<P>Di&s;owning even in criminal ca&s;es is a remnant of Ju|dai&s;m. The Phara&s;aical church di&s;owned for things inno|cent, and prai&s;e-worthy, and it will always reduce that &s;ociety who practi&s;es it to a re&s;emblance with them. Such will &s;train at a gnat and &s;wallow a camel. Innocent per|&s;ons will be di&s;owned, and &s;inners remain in the church: the rules operate thus unavoidably. Many have been dealt with for that which was not &s;inful, who yet have been made &s;inners before the meeting had done with them. There is &s;carce a member of the &s;ociety who has not heard of the famous, or rather infamous George Keith; yet but few are acquainted with his ca&s;e; and it calls for more pity, than has been generally be&s;towed upon it. George was a man of great talents, and learning, an emi|nent mini&s;ter among Friends, and high in e&s;teem; but
<PB N="29" REF="035015_0027_0FFFE976520E44C8">
holding an opinion re&s;pecting the future &s;tate of the &s;oul, different from what was generally held, and happening to expre&s;s this &s;entiment in his public te&s;timony, he was called to an account, as one not orthodox; he &s;upported his opinion, as might be expected, and &s;o a field of con|trover&s;y was opened. George being a man of high tem|per, and tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him, men not thoroughly &s;anctified, or they would have been wi&s;er than to have made a man an offender, for an opinion in metaphy&s;ics. The breach, by degrees, grow wider, and wider, until George was at length di&s;owned. This, to a man who had been &s;o much e&s;teemed, and one perhaps of an irritable temper, was more than he could bear: It &s;o operated up|on his mind, that at length he ca&s;t off the Quaker entire|ly, and oppo&s;ed the &s;ociety with great acrimony. Many a man &s;ince his day has met with a fate &s;omewhat &s;imilar.</P>
<P>Numbers have been dealt with for that which was not &s;inful, and far the doing of which they were not &s;orry; yet have been obliged to condemn it rather than be di&s;|owned, and thereby were made &s;inners, when they were not &s;o before. In many in&s;tances, per&s;ons have deliberate|ly planned a violation of the rules of the &s;ociety, and at the &s;ame time planned an acknowledgment for the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion; which has been received and all &s;eemed well.</P>
<P>Manifold are the evils that attend di&s;owning: it leads to in&s;incerity, &s;ubterfuge, and di&s;&s;imulation; and not only individual members are embarra&s;&s;ed in this re&s;pect by it, but the &s;ociety at times are &s;o likewi&s;e. A remarkable in|&s;tance of this kind happened &s;ome years ago.</P>
<P>A number of wicked men, inhabitants of Lanca&s;ter county, having an hatred for the Indians without excep|tion, a&s;&s;embled together, and fell upon a &s;ettlement in &s;aid county, and murdered every one who happened to be at home. The re&s;t of the tribe being di&s;per&s;ed about the country, &s;elling their ba&s;kets and brooms; upon hear|ing of the &s;ad cata&s;trophe which befel their relations, fled, &s;ome of them to Lanca&s;ter, and begged the protection of the inhabitants. The be&s;t protection which could be given the&s;e poor creatures, was to lock them up in a pri&s;on; but bolted doors and brick walls, were poor defence. The&s;e &s;oon gave way to tho&s;e de&s;perate men; and every man, woman, and child, inclo&s;ed within the walls, were murdered. The re|mainder
<PB N="30" REF="035015_0028_0FFFE97A977AB630">
of this wretched tribe collected together, and ha&s;tened to Philadelphia, and put them&s;elves under the protection of the inhabitants. They were pur&s;ued, and ex|pre&s;&s;es came to this City, giving an account that tho&s;e wicked men, not only vowed de&s;truction to the Indians, but the death of &s;everal Friends likewi&s;e. At length, an expre&s;s came in the morning, before the dawning of the day, with information, that tho&s;e in&s;urgents were within a few miles of the city. The inhabitants were called up, and a&s;&s;embled in the &s;treets in great numbers, and a con|&s;ultation was held, to know what mea&s;ures &s;hould be ta|ken at this alarming cri&s;is. What could be done? There was no doubt of the bloody de&s;ign of the men: they had given an unque&s;tionable proof of this. Nothing could be done, but either quietly give up the Indians, and &s;ome Friends as a &s;acrifice, or gird on the &s;word, and defend them. It was determined to defend them: great expedi|tion was u&s;ed accordingly; and &s;uch of the inhabitants who had &s;ome knowledge in military affairs, took the lead, and prepared for defence. Divers Friends joined in the mi|litary parade. Not an individual in the &s;ociety appeared to di&s;countenance the thing. Why &s;hould they? A formida|ble appearance was &s;oon made, which &s;o intimidated tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, that they halted at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city, gave over their de&s;ign, and returned home. Thus, this black and terrible &s;torm blew over&mdash;a &s;torm, which in ap|pearance, &s;eemed to portend &s;omething more de&s;perate and bloody, than what had happened before, bad as it was. A calm en&s;ued, and &s;erious reflection returned to the people called Quakers. They &s;aw their te&s;timony was vi|olated, and it became a que&s;tion of importance, to know what &s;hould be done, to wipe away the reproach, as it was termed by &s;ome. Strange, indeed, that it &s;hould be thought a reproach, for men who were not in danger them&s;elves, to &s;tep forward, and at the ri&s;k of their own lives, defend the lives of others! every other part of man|kind, would term it an high in&s;tance of heroic virtue. There were divers conferrences held upon this &s;ubject, in which the members of the &s;ociety were divided in opini|on: &s;ome thought they &s;hould proceed as the di&s;cipline directs; which requires an acknowledgment for &s;uch con|duct, or that the &s;ociety &s;hould bear a te&s;timony again&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="035015_0029_0FFFAE1E8438BFE0">
the violators of the rule. But there were other per&s;ons, men of virtue, and &s;uperior under&s;tanding, who could not proceed to condemn men for doing that, which, at the time of trial was generally approbated. The&s;e Friends prevailed over the others, and the bu&s;ine&s;s ended: had the &s;entiments of the other Friends prevailed, the &s;ociety would have merited the highe&s;t reproach.</P>
<P>In many re&s;pects men are free agents. Were there &s;e|veral roads all leading to the &s;ame place, a traveller might take his choice. A man intending to vi&s;it his friend may do it to day, or to-morrow, or at another time. If a man &s;hould think the plain language mo&s;t agreeable, he can u&s;e it. If he likes a plain dre&s;s, he can put it on. He may go to any place of wor&s;hip which &s;uits his inclina|tion, or accompli&s;h his marriage in a way he likes be&s;t. But with re&s;pect to re&s;i&s;tance or non-re&s;i&s;tance, the ca&s;e is very different. A man cannot either re&s;i&s;t, or let it alone, as he may plea&s;e: no man can &s;ay, I will not defend my life, or the life of my wife and children, or the life of my friend, or my country. And to make a rule, that a man &s;hould not do it, is above all things the mo&s;t un|rea&s;onable and improper; much more &s;o, than it would be, to make a rule, that a man &s;hould neither rejoice nor be &s;orrowful, upon any occa&s;ion whatever. Men are not machines, or automatons: they cannot act, in many in|&s;tances, even according to their own previous determi|nation, much le&s;s according to that of others.</P>
<P>Since the people called Quakers fir&s;t came forth, the evils occa&s;ioned by their di&s;cipline, to many families, and individuals, have been numerous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oh! how great has been the angui&s;h which &s;ome per&s;ons have en|dured on this account. The author, &s;ome years ago, &s;pent about a week with two friends, a man and his wife, who were excommunicated, the man was di&s;owned for his attachment to his country during the American revolution, though he had done nothing contrary to the rules of the &s;ociety, being an eminent public Friend, and as agree|able a man as the writer ever knew: his wife was di&s;owned becau&s;e &s;he loved her hu&s;band, and could not join the meeting in their cen&s;ure again&s;t him: &s;he was an amiable woman, and an approved mini&s;ter. This circum&s;tance of excommunication, was &s;o &s;evere an affliction to her, &s;he being a very tender, delicate, and weakly woman, as that it encrea&s;ed her complaints; and her hu&s;band told the writer whil&s;t he was in their family that he was a&s;&s;ured it would co&s;t him the lo&s;s of his wife. Some time after the author had returned home, he &s;aw this Friend in this city, and was informed by him, that his wife was dead, and that her death was occa&s;ioned, or ha&s;tened by the circum&s;tance above mentioned.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>This e&s;&s;ay is to &s;how that di&s;owning is wrong in any ca&s;e; but to di&s;own a man for defending his life, or the life of his friend, or the government under which he lives, are extraordinary ca&s;es. The people called Quakers, from the fir&s;t, have been advocates for government, they ad|mit that it is a divine ordinance; have held the highe&s;t of|fices in government; hold large property; claim of go|vernment a protection for their per&s;ons and property, and yet if a member of the &s;ociety &s;hould join with his fellow-citizens in &s;upporting this government, in the on|ly way in which in extreme ca&s;es it can be maintained, this man is di&s;owned. They bear a te&s;timony again&s;t de|fen&s;ive war, and yet admit the nece&s;&s;ity of government. I a&s;k them, if government it&s;elf is not a defen&s;ive war? Is it not under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to lay hold on the wicked di&s;turbers of its peace, and to puni&s;h them, &s;ome by con|finement to hard labour, and others by putting them to death?

Might not divine providence interpo&s;e and prevent tho&s;e evils which government is intended to &s;uppre&s;s? The forming a government, ari&s;es from the probability of a combination of wicked men to do mi&s;chief; and to repel &s;uch attacks it is ordained. It would &s;eem &s;trange, that a per&s;on &s;hould take on him an office of a coer&s;ive nature, and yet when an occa&s;ion offered for exerting this power, he &s;hould de|cline it, on a pre&s;umption that divine providence might interpo&s;e, and render his exertions unnece&s;&s;ary. If tho&s;e were his &s;entiments, why hold the office? If government is a divine ordinance, it cannot be a want of confidence in divine protection, to u&s;e means for its &s;upport.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a man was alarmed at midnight, by a num|ber of villains, who meant to rob and murder him, his wife and children; the di&s;cipline &s;ays, in effect, he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to it, rather than prevent it by violence; and if the man could prevent it no other way than by the death of tho&s;e men, and &s;hould &s;lay them, he mu&s;t condemn his conduct, or he is liable to be di&s;owned.</P>
<P>This doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance does not &s;tand upon the &s;ame ground as other doctrines do. A man may change his opinion from time to time, and as he changes, may be e&s;teemed a proper member of that &s;ociety, who&s;e doctrines corre&s;pond with his own; but with re&s;pect to non-re&s;i&s;tance, the criterion of fellow&s;hip is made to con|&s;i&s;t, not in &s;entiment, but in &s;o acting, as not one man in an hundred thou&s;and could act, were he brought to the te&s;t; and tho&s;e very men, who excommunicate for &s;elf-defence, would do the &s;ame thing, were the trial brought home to them&s;elves. Mu&s;t not that di&s;cipline then be founded in error, which requires an impo&s;&s;ibility?</P>
<P>It is agreed that government is a divine ordinance: the people called Quakers admit it. I tru&s;t it is here &s;hewn that government cannot exi&s;t without defence, the &s;word being its &s;inews. Government in its e&s;&s;ence is a defen&s;ive war; a defen&s;ive war therefore of that kind is not &s;inful.</P>
<P>But tho' a defence of this nature is not &s;inful, yet our ble&s;&s;ed Lord has pointed to a &s;tate more de&s;irable, even
<PB N="34" REF="035015_0032_0FFFE984774DE9C8">
that in which there is no &s;trife&mdash;a &s;tate of ab&s;olute chri&s;|tian perfection. And, as he &s;aid upon another occa&s;ion, &s;o let it be &s;aid upon this occa&s;ion, he that is able to receive it, let him receive it; but few among the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t, have been able to receive it. It is a different thing from embracing a &s;y&s;tem of religious tenets, which may render a man a member of that &s;ociety, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed for holding them. To be a chri&s;tian, is to be made a new creature; it is to experience a thorough &s;anctification; being inward|ly made, &s;uch as Chri&s;t was, and thereby manife&s;ting an outward conformity to the great example &s;et us by him. This &s;tate is not to be attained in&s;tantly, even by tho&s;e who &s;incerely wi&s;h to attain it: It is therefore as unrea|&s;onable to expect that all who profe&s;s the chri&s;tian name, &s;hould, in all ca&s;es, act the part of perfect chri&s;tians, as it would be, to expect that a new born babe, &s;hould po&s;|&s;e&s;s all the faculties, and bodily &s;trength, of a man in the prime of life. As it is only the perfect man in Chri&s;t who re&s;i&s;teth no evil, &s;o to expect this of all, under pain of ex|pul&s;ion, is to expect children to read, who have never learned their letters, and yet, for their deficiency, to expel them the college.</P>
<P>The impropriety of di&s;owning, has been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, chiefly upon the principle of its being &s;uppo&s;ed a prero|gative of the Church of Chri&s;t. But there are &s;ome that approve it, who found their opinion upon other grounds: they will not contend, that Friends are the pure Church of Chri&s;t; but they &s;ay, that all &s;ocieties have a right to lay down &s;uch rules as they may think proper, for the well-ordering of the body, and for a te&s;t of chri&s;tian fel|low&s;hip: that all who do not comply with tho&s;e rules, have no rea&s;on to complain when they are di&s;owned, as they &s;hould not have violated them. Friends of this de&s;|cription, do not &s;uppo&s;e that a te&s;timony given again&s;t &s;uch who tran&s;gre&s;s, implies an exclu&s;ion from heaven, they yet contend, it is expedient to keep up the rules of the &s;ociety. Here are two kinds of men, who differ widely in their principles, yet practically agree. Tho&s;e who believe the &s;ociety of Friends are the Church of Chri&s;t, that they have the mind of Chri&s;t, and that di&s;owning nece&s;&s;arily implies an exclu&s;ion from heaven, are, according to the ancient
<PB N="35" REF="035015_0033_0FFFE986E0FD9650">
principle laid down by Barclay, the true and orthodox Qua|kers. The others who do not &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ociety are the pure Church, who do not pretend to binding, and loo&s;ing in hea|ven and on earth, are mo&s;t catholic and mode&s;t. But let me a&s;k tho&s;e Friends, &s;uppo&s;ing a number of men were form|ing them&s;elves into a religious &s;ociety, for the purpo&s;es of improvement in piety and virtue, would the pre&s;ent di&s;ci|pline of Friends be the mo&s;t proper rules to produce this effect? Would they agree, that no one among them &s;hould marry a per&s;on of any other &s;ociety, tho' ever &s;o amiable, under pain of being expelled from the body; nor even a member of their own &s;ociety, unle&s;s they ac|compli&s;hed their marriage agreeable to one particular form? that no man &s;hould defend his own life, nor the life of his friend, nor the government under which he lived, nor pay taxes for military purpo&s;es, nor a fine for not complying with the laws in certain ca&s;es? that no man &s;hould publi&s;h a religious, or political treati&s;e, with|out con&s;ent of the &s;ociety, under the penalty of being ex|pelled from the body? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any num|ber of men of &s;ound under&s;tanding, would, in the pre&s;ent day, lay down &s;uch a plan, and make a compliance with tho&s;e rules the te&s;t of chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip? If then it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a ca&s;e, are they wi&s;e, who make tho&s;e rules the te&s;t of chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, merely becau&s;e they were made the conditions of fellow&s;hip by their an|ce&s;tors? How much more rea&s;onable would it be in them to &s;ay, the de&s;ign of this in&s;titution is, that we may be mutually in&s;trumental in promoting the temporal and eternal felicity one of another. We feel the importance of a virtuous life, we will therefore u&s;e all the means with which divine providence may favour us &s;olely for this end. If then a brother &s;hould be overtaken in a fault, we will endeavour to re&s;tore &s;uch a one in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, con&s;idering our&s;elves, le&s;t we al&s;o be tempted; but in no ca&s;e whatever, &s;hall any one be expelled from the &s;o|ciety, le&s;t it &s;hould prove his ruin. How greatly prefera|ble would &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of church government be? How much better adapted to the purpo&s;es of religious a&s;&s;ocia|tion? How perfectly corre&s;ponding with the go&s;pel of our Lord and Saviour, and the great end and de&s;ign of his coming? Such then is the plan of the religious &s;ociety of Free-Quakers in the city of Philadelphia.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="035015_0034_0FFFE9886A8C0760">It may be objected to the foregoing, that if every man is to enjoy his opinions without cen&s;ure, he mu&s;t be at liberty to publi&s;h or to preach them, and that this would render the &s;ociety, rather a Bable, than a Chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>ANSWER.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t perfect plan that can be formed for a reli|gious &s;ociety is liable to &s;ome inconveniences; but tho&s;e inconveniences are to be &s;ubmitted to, in order to avoid greater. The evils of di&s;owning are manife&s;ted in the foregoing treati&s;e. Although the right of individuals are to be maintained, yet the church has its prerogative al&s;o, which is that of determining, whether what is offered to them is edifying or otherwi&s;e: here wi&s;dom is nece&s;&s;ary, mutual love and forbearance ought to be exerci&s;ed; and although the individuals who compo&s;e a &s;ociety, may differ in opinion in le&s;&s;er matters, yet if the love and fear of the Lord prevail, they will be favoured with di&s;cern|ment, &s;o as to encourage that which is good and edify|ing; and &s;uppre&s;s that which is otherwi&s;e. It does not then follow, that becau&s;e no one &s;hall be di&s;owned, that therefore that which is evidently of evil tendency is to be received, or countenanced. A variety of opinions may prevail, yet perfect order and decency may be maintain|ed in the church. After all the pains taken by the differ|ent &s;ocieties in Chri&s;tendom to pre&s;erve what each of them call orthodoxy, yet contradiction frequently appears. If then, a diver&s;ity of &s;entiment is unavoidable, may it not as well be admitted, and acquie&s;ced in? Is it not a vain attempt to aim at that which is impo&s;&s;ible? And may not a variety of opinions be made an occa&s;ion of mutual love, forbearance, and charity? and &s;o a means of manife&s;ting more con&s;picuou&s;ly, the graces of the go&s;pel? Religion con&s;i&s;teth more in love to the Lord, and to one another, than in &s;amene&s;s of opinion: the latter is de&s;irable, but not e&s;&s;ential: it may happen where there is but little vir|tue; and on the other hand, there may be a diver&s;ity of &s;entiments accompanied with a virtuous life this is pre|ferable. Such then is that which is propo&s;ed and de&s;ired by the religious &s;ociety called Free Quakers.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>ON a review of the foregoing, the author expects he &s;hall give offence to Friends. He has endeavoured to lay wa&s;te that which by &s;ome is held &s;acred; the di&s;cipline in their opinion, being of divine origin. Numbers, both men and women, who are virtuous, and &s;incere, make the maintaining tho&s;e rules a great part of their religious con|cern: for this do they cro&s;s &s;ea and land, and undergo great difficulty, dangers and hard&s;hip. What can the wri|ter then expect, but that he &s;hould be e&s;teemed an ene|my to truth, and even reviled by &s;ome? But the motive to this publication is known to the &s;earcher of hearts: the author believes, that all men will be called to account for their deeds, whether they be good or evil. Under an impre&s;&s;ion of this &s;olemn truth, and for the cau&s;e and te&s;timony of Je&s;us, is this publication &s;ent forth. If it is now rejected, as there is rea&s;on to expect it will be, the writer believes, the day is coming, when the nature of the go&s;pel will be better under&s;tood, and when the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical government of the people called Quakers will be reformed, and grounded upon principles more evan|gelical than at pre&s;ent it is. May Je&s;us, for the con&s;o|lation of his people, ha&s;ten the day.&mdash;<HI>Amen.</HI></P>
