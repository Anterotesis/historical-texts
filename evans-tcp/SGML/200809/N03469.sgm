<P>Afterwards, growing weak by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Di|vi&s;ions, they became a kind of Tributary King|dom to the <HI>Romans,</HI> under the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Family;</HI> and continued to &s;ink till they became a <HI>Roman Province,</HI> under Procurators and Governours, &s;uch as <HI>Florus, Fe&s;tus, Felix</HI> and others.</P>
<P>And having helped to fill up the mea&s;ure of their Iniquities by Crucifying the Lord of Life &amp; Glory, their Divi&s;ion being &s;till greatly in|flamed, they were involved in a Sea of troubles, till it terminated in their utter de&s;olation, both of Church and State.</P>
<P>This &s;hould be a <HI>Warning</HI> to all Governments, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are under the jealous Eye of &s;uch who are ready to ob&s;erve, and improve every part of their ill Conduct: It &s;hould be a <HI>Motive to keep</HI>' as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith) <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;pirit in the bond of peace,</HI> Eph. 4.3.</P>
<P>At the time of our Saviours Publick appear|ance and mini&s;try, the <HI>Jews</HI> were crumbled and broken into many Parties &amp; Factions: The Con|trover&s;ies were maintained with eagerne&s;s and carried on with great best and animo&s;ity.

<P>Three of the principal contending Parties appear before Chri&s;t, tempting him, pur&s;uant to a determination they had come to, after a deep con&s;ultation among them&s;elves, Luk 20 20. <HI>And they watched him, and &s;ent forth &s;pies, which &s;hould feign them&s;elves ju&s;t men, that they might take hold of his words; that &s;o they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governour.</HI> Feign them&s;elves Ju&s;t men, Men truly Reli|gious, who came to him with ca&s;es of Con&s;ci|ence: And to gain his confidence, they begin with Propo&s;itions mo&s;t true in them&s;elves, but as de&s;ign'd by them, the vile&s;t Tie chery &amp; the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Flattery; and for this Rea&s;on our Sa|viour charges them with Hypocri&s;ie Mat 22.16 <HI>We know that thou art true, and teache&s;t the way of God is truth, and carest not for any man; for thou regardest not the per&s;on of man.</HI> Ver. 18. <HI>Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? &mdash;</HI></P>
<P>The Three Parties were the <HI>Herodians,</HI> the <HI>Sadduces,</HI> and the <HI>Lawyers;</HI> which la&s;t were of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall take a &s;hort view of the&s;e Three Parties, and begin with the la&s;t fir&s;t; and &s;o go

back to the fir&s;t, which will bring us to our Text; it being a particular An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion propo&s;ed by the <HI>Herodians.</HI></P>
<P>The term <HI>Lawyer</HI> is not to be under&s;tood as in the pre&s;ent u&s;e and acceptation of the word. In the pre&s;ent u&s;e of the term, we under&s;tand tho&s;e that <HI>Study and Practice the Common Law, the Civil or Common Law.</HI> The&s;e were &s;o called <HI>as being Expo&s;itors of the Law of God given by Mo|&s;es</HI> They rendred the Law void by tho&s;e In|terpretations they put upon it: They preten|ded to great Zeal for the Law, and for the Rights of the People; A&s;&s;erting that <HI>they were of the &s;eed of Abraham and were free;</HI> nor ought they to be in Subjection to the <HI>Romans. Job</HI> 8 33 Infu&s;ing tho&s;e Doctrines into the People, was the occa&s;ion of &s;undry In&s;urrections &amp; Tumults, led on by <HI>Thudas</HI> &amp; <HI>Judas</HI> of Galilee: Of which we have an account, <HI>Act.</HI> 5.36, 37.</P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;prang tho&s;e, afterwards called <HI>the Zealots,</HI> who did &s;o much mi&s;chief to their own Nation, and brought on ruine upon them. They pretended to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Sir <HI>William Temple</HI>'s Memoirs.</NOTE> great Zeal for Religion and Concern for the Publick Good. A great Writer ob&s;erves, <HI>That when a Religious &amp; Civil Controver&s;ie comes to be twisted and blended toge|ther, it makes a &s;trong Ferment.</HI></P>

to intangle him in the Controver&s;ie that was &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among them, <HI>Whether the Command about Sacrifices, or the Moral Law were the great|e&s;t?</HI> The&s;e according to our Modern way of &s;peaking, we may call the Country Party.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other Party were <HI>the Sadducees,</HI> who denied the Re&s;urrection We may ob&s;erve that each Party drew Arguments from their re&s;pective Principles, Each taking an Arrow out of their own Quiver. The <HI>Lawyer</HI> came with a Que&s;tion about <HI>the Law;</HI> the <HI>Sadducees</HI> about <HI>the Re&s;urrection;</HI> and the <HI>Herodians</HI> con|cerning <HI>Tribute.</HI> They &s;ay, Ver. 24 <HI>Ma&s;ter, Mo&s;es &s;aid if a man die having no children, his brother &s;hall marry his wife, and rai&s;e up &s;eed unto his brother.</HI> In order to perplex the ca&s;e the more, and render the Que&s;tion unan&s;werable, They &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e of Seven Brethren having &s;ucce&s;&s;ively Married One Woman; the ca&s;e would have been the &s;ame if but Two had Married her. They ask, <HI>Who&s;e wife &s;hall &s;he be, for all had her?</HI> Ver. 29. <HI>Je&s;us an&s;wered &amp; &s;aid, Ye do err, not knowing the &s;criptures, nor the power of God.</HI> Ver. 30. <HI>In the re&s;urrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels of God.</HI> That is, they are immortal, and therefore there is no need of Marriage to continue the Species<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Whitby</HI> in loc.</NOTE> Not that rai&s;ed Bodies &s;hall be like Angels in every re&s;pect; but in

this is the likene&s;s de&s;igned, and that is &s;uffi|cient. Our Saviour proceeds to a Proof of the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection and future State, from one of the Books of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> becau&s;e the Sadducees di&s;own'd at the Scripture, ex|cept tho&s;e Five Books And doubtle&s;s they tho't them&s;elves &s;afe enough: they did not expect any Argument to prove this Point could be drawn from the Books of <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> but they found them&s;elves much mi&s;taken. His Proof is, That God had &s;aid, as in ver. 32 <HI>I am the God of Abraham, the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob: He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</HI> This was an irre&s;i&s;table Argument to the <HI>Jews;</HI> Luk. 20.39 The Scribes reply'd, <HI>Ma&s;ter, thou ha&s;t well &s;aid.</HI> That is, It is a good Proof, of a &s;ufficient Argument And the <HI>Sadducees</HI> with a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> their Craft and Confidence were put to &s;ilence</P>
<P>It is true, that the force of this Rea&s;oning is not Equally plain to us as it was to the <HI>Jews;</HI> but lies <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a little. The <HI>Jews</HI> well under&s;tood that when God promi&s;ed to be a God to any, that he would be a Covenant God to them; that He would be a Father to them and they &s;hould be his Sons. Deut 14.1. <HI>Ye are the children of the Lord your God. Say unto Pharaoh, Let my &s;on go,</HI> Ho&s; 11 1 <HI>Rev</HI> 21 7. This Son&s;hip imports the Redemption of the Body from corruption The Apo&s;tle who well knew the ancient Doctrine and Faith of
<PB N="7" REF="004241_0006_100430E4700D2D90">
the <HI>Jews,</HI> makes this one part of the privilege of Adoption, Rom 8 33. <HI>We wait,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>for the adoption, that is for the redemption of the body.</HI> God's being a God to any, not only contains in it an a&s;&s;urance of the Redemption or Re&s;urrection of the Body, but it al&s;o contains a Pro|mi&s;e of everla&s;ting Re&s;t &amp; Glory. Heb 11.16. <HI>Wherefore God is not a&s;hamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a city.</HI> That is he will &s;o fully an&s;wer all his Covenant Engagements, in rai&s;ing them from the Dead and making them Happy, that he will not need to be a&s;ha|med as tho&s;e are who are not &s;o good as heir word As the <HI>Sadducees</HI> deny'd the Re&s;ur|rection of the Body and a Future State, this Argument confuted both their Errors.</P>
<P>To &s;et before you he full force of our Sa|viour's Argument, requires more time than this occa&s;ion will allow. I am not in&s;en&s;ible that being &s;o very long upon it as I have may be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a Digre&s;&s;ion, but as it &s;erves to Evi|dence the Ju&s;tice of the Remark <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> fir&s;t hearers made. <HI>That never man &s;pake like him;</HI> I hope it will be pardoned The&s;e <HI>Sadducees</HI> were of loo&s;e &amp; libertine Principles Act. 23 8. <HI>For the Sadducees &s;ay there is no re&s;urrection, nei|ther angel nor &s;pirit; but the Phari&s;ees confe&s;s hath.</HI> So that we may call this Party, in our Modern way of &s;peaking the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> of that age.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the la&s;t place we are to take a view of the <HI>Herodians.</HI> Some of the ancient Fathers,
<PB N="8" REF="004241_0007_1004311910089570">
<HI>Jerom, Tertullian,</HI> and others, &s;uppo&s;e that this Party were &s;o called by the <HI>Jews,</HI> from <HI>Herod the Great,</HI> whom they believ'd was the Me&s;&s;ias, becau&s;e of his Wealth Power &amp; Magnificence. He appeared, as they tho't the Me&s;&s;ias &s;hould do: But this &s;eems to be without foundation. For tho' <HI>Herod</HI> did many actions to gain the peoples Favour; As melting down his own Plate to buy Corn for the People in a time of Famine. He Rebuilt the Temple with great Expence. Yet the Nation had &s;o &s;ettled an Aver&s;ion to him and his Government that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him, by any acts of gene|ro&s;ity, to remove it. And farther to &s;hew the ungroundedne&s;s of this Opinion, we are to con&s;ider, That the Me&s;&s;iah was to &s;pring from the Hou&s;e of <HI>David;</HI> but this <HI>Herod</HI> was not of the Stock of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> nor of the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> or Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> but an <HI>Idumean</HI> or <HI>Edomite;</HI> and moreover before this time he was dead and his Party before this time mu&s;t have been dead too.</P>
<P>As <HI>Herod</HI> was Supported by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and made his Court to them, acknowledged their Authority; and did not &s;o much as make or alter his la&s;t Will without their con&s;ent. The&s;e per&s;ons or this Party called <HI>Herodians,</HI> were &s;uch who adhered to the <HI>Romans,</HI> &s;upported <HI>Herod's</HI> Cau&s;e, and owned the propriety and ju&s;tice of paying Tribute to <HI>Ce&s;ar:</HI> Being thus in <HI>Herod's</HI> Intere&s;t, they were called <HI>Herodians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004241_0007_1004311910089570">
The&s;e were <HI>State Officers, Souldiers, Collectors,</HI> call'd <HI>Publicans;</HI> and on that account &s;o very odious to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they ranned <HI>Publicans</HI> and <HI>Sinners</HI> together: When they would Expo&s;e our Saviour to the rage and contempt of the People, they &s;ay, <HI>He is a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Herodians</HI> propo&s;ed this Que&s;tion, is was not becau&s;e of any Scruple they had of the lawfulne&s;s of paying Tribute; but it was with de&s;ign to in&s;nare him.
